He is\nMr. George Butler, the messenger from Aero. I am\nwriting this letter not only\nto let more people know why\nhe has not been at work re-cent ly, but more importantly\n\"> express the wishes of so\nmany students that he will\n>*v} \u00a3ea full and quick re-fi very. It is as a result of a despicable act of violence that\nMr. Butler is in hospital.\nSomeone threw a brick into\nhis face damaging his sight.\nMany of the messengers\nwith whom he works have\nbeen to see him and so have\nsome of the students who\nhave got to know him. I think it is important now to\nlet as many people as possible know that students do\ncare about the people who\nhelp the departments so\n\u2022*nch.\nYours,\nADRIAN E. SMITH.\nP.S.: This college runs a large personnel department\nto deal with their employees.\nSince they did not even know\nabout this incident, I am\nforced to wonder whether\nthey spend their time dealing with all the individuals\nthey employ or simply trying\nto force through productivity\ndeals.\nFREE\nPLUG\nSit,\nLast week David Humphreys, Chairman of the\nMethodist Society, strongly\ndisputed Mr. Campbell's suggestion that \"God is a crutch\nfor people who can't come\nto terms with objective rea-lit y\". But it is true that many\npeople cannot come to terms\nwith objective reality. God\nis a crutch for these people,\njust as surely if it is religion\nas if is is sex, money or al co hol. And an escape from\nreality comes as surely to the\nreligious type who expects\nall to be well in the end as\nto the drug taker who finds\na reality only when he is\nhigh or the Communist who\nexpects a golden age to follow revolution.\nLet us make no mistake,\nhowever, by failing to recognise that these gods are not\nthe God of the bible, who\nrevealed himself in objective\nreality in the person of Jesus\nChrist who went about doing\ngood. And we find that this\nGod did something about the\nreality of our universal tendency to do what we know is\nwrong.\nWhen one looks at some\nof these realities one has to\nagree with Mr. Humphreys.\nIn Jesus Christ is the only\ntrue answer to living a life\nof reality.\nFor those interested relevant literature (some free)\nis available from the Christion Union books tall, Thursday lunchtimes in the JCR.\nYours sincerely,\nROBERT. J. HIGGINS ON.E lec. Eng.3. POVERTY\nSTRICKEN\nSit.\nI would be very interested\nin learning for whom Mr.\nFenner was working at a \u00a34,750 rate, and whether\nthis was a monthly or annual salat y, as I need a bit of\ncash myself?\nSurely it couldn't have\nbeen for reviewing plays?\nYouts faithfully\nand poverty-stricken,\nDAVID GURNEY. NO WAGE\nINCREASES\nSir,\nWhen I first came to work\nin IC, I was informed that\nthe College had an excellent\nreputation in the world of\nScience and Technology.\nSince the entrance requirements were also rather high,\nI assumed that all the students were of a reasonable\nlevel of intelligence.\nLast week's \"Felix\" had\none glowing example to the\ncontrary, J. H. Fenner's let-ter. Never have I seen such\nridiculous words in print!\nHis advocacy of the typical\nTory laissez-faire ideology\nwas not even cleverly put forward in the way of most\nbright-eyed Tories.\nIt would be quite easy to\npresent notional figures on\nthe frequency of wage increases (salaries to you, Mr.\nFenner), including figures\nfor that small minority of\ndegree holders. But as Felix\nconcerns itself with IC it is\nto this area that I will restrict myself.\nImperial College messen-gers, male cleaners, refectory\nstaff, female cleaners and\nlaboratory staff have not received any wage increase\nsince December 1st1971. IC barmen and security\nguards have waited a similar length of time, and if\none were to look at the clerical staff situation it might be\neven worse. Of course, as\nMr. Fenner has such faith\nin the idea of meritocracy,\nhe might as well claim that\nthe above group of workers\ndo not merit any increase.\nWell, besides simple things\nsuch as the thousands of\npounds saved as a result of\nstaff reductions and increased productivity there is\nanother slight matter to be\nconsidered, i.e., the rise in\nthe cost of living since 1971.\nOr doesn't that count, Mr.\nFenner?\nMay I suggest, Mr. Fenner, that you report immediately to your parents and\nprimary school so as to\nundergo the complete social is ation and education process again, as something obviously went wrong last\ntime.\nYours sincerely,\nA. J.O 'BRIEN,\nMessenger and\nNUPE shop steward.\nEditor's note: Correspondence on the subject of IC\nemployees' salaries and conditions and that of workers in general is now closed. INTERESTING\nLETTER\nSir,\nI found David Humphteys\nletter in FELIX last week in-te resting, as it exhibits many\nof the elements of confused\nbourgeois religious ideology\nprevalent in students today.\nUnfortunately he has negated the first half of his\nletter by ignoring the adjective \"objective\" in the\nphrase \"objective reality\" in\nmy poem of the week be-fore. I am not in the habit\nof adding superfluous modifiers to my lines for the sake\nof scansion alone. In that\none word lay the crux of my\nphilosophical argument: in\norder not to fall into the sophist and so lips is t contradictions inherent in all idealist\nphilosophies, which include\nthe theistic religions, one\nmust assume the existence of\nobjective reality. In other\nwords, that there exists matter outside of mind, this implies that mind is but the\nhighest stage of matter and\nhas no spiritual existence.\n(For further substantiation I refer Mr. Humphreys to\n\"Materialism and EmpirioCriticism\" by V.I. Lenin).\nThose who turn to alcohol and drugs are living proof\nof how consciousness is very\nmuch secondary to reality.\nThese people, finding the\nreality of life in present-day\nsociety unbearable, have no\nrecourse but to resort to escapism\u2014they are not searching for reality, Mr. Humphreys, but retreating from\nits contradictions.\nTo try and differentiate between changing social structure and changing people is\nimpossible, for any change in\none is a change in the other-it is clear that a social structure cannot be imposed by\nanyone outside society. Jesus\nChrist was a revolutionary of\nhis time, though in his time\nhe had almost no effect \u2014\nhis death is recorded in the\nannals of the era as that of\njust another troublemaker.\nIt was not until the 4th century A.D. that Constantine,\nEmperor of Rome, needing a unifying structure to hold together his crumbling empire,\nadopted Christianity. Its\nelements of rigid hierarchy\nand autocratic rule from\nabove made it the perfect\nphilosophy of life, tailor-made as it indeed was, to\nkeep the ruling class and\nhim in particular in power,\nand that oppressed class of\nthe time in its place.\nThis also accounts for religions of a similar structure\nbeing associated with all\nclass-based societies and the\ncontinuing popularity of\nChristianity in Britain today.\nThis is further borne out by\nthe fact that whenever a state has arisen out of\nclass conflict by the fact\nthat whenever a state has\narisen out of class conflict,\nas it must to ensure the continuing power of the ruling\nclass, one sees the decay of\npantheistic and other polytheistic religions and the\nadoption of a monotheistic\nreligion promoted by the ruling class of the time.\nALASDHAIR RD\nCAMPBELL.\nFELIX No. 330: Tuesday, 27th February1973.

    "content": "February 27th,1973 FELIX Page 7\nJoint Election\nManifesto\nFELIX announced its\nintention of printing can-di dates' manifestos several weeks ago. At the\ndeadline time, 1700 hrs\non Friday, we had received a joint manifesto\nfrom Messrs. Rob Armitage and Simon Allnutt,\nand this is reproduced\nbelow. The other candidates did not send in\nmanifestos.\nMy name is Simon All nut t.Ia ma third year\nphysicist. Having entered\nthe college as an engineer\nanu changed to physics\nmeans that I have been\nhere an extra year. Rob Armitage and myself are\nstanding with same mani-fes to, given below.\nIt is our belief that both\nsabbatical officers wishing\nto attain the same forward\nlooking objectives, results\nin a more active union.\nOne person, in general,\nwill have less chance of\nseeing the problems the\nunion will face in the first\nplace, will not produce as\nmany ideas on how to\ntackle them, and finally, of\ncarrying them through to\na successful conclusion.\nTHE COLLEGE COMMUNITY As many people as possible should be involved in\nthe union's activities at all\nlevels, producing the ideas\nto improve the union for\nits members. Contact between sabbatical officers\nand the students for exchange of ideas would be\nmost direct at departmental level. As well as this\ndepartments should have\nmore contact between all students, both post-g radu ate and under-graduate,\nand staff of all denominations for a better education\nand satisfactory community. The college community\nconsists of more than just\nthe academic staff and\nstudents. In these times\nwhen the students are suffering economically we\nare under a moral obligation to protect the jobs of\nworkers in the college who\nhave dependants to sup-port.\nADVERTISING FEATURE Why Life Assurance?\nCOURSE STRUCTURE In the present situation\nof graduate unemployment\nthe flexibility of our education is of paramount im-port ance. One of the great benefits\nof the course unit system\nsaid to operate in this\nCollege should be the\nchoice of courses offered\nto students, enabling them\nto qualify in a broader\nfield, whilst allowing special is ation should the student wish it.\nWith the present job\nsituation, it is a great advantage to have a broader\nfield of interest, even if\nthis is used temporarily\nuntil the \"right job\" arises.\nDoes this apply at\n, present? Not satisfactorily.\nThe recent appointment\nof the Academic Director\nby the college indicates\nthat now is the time for\nwe students to suggest new\ncourse contents where nec-ess ary, to make courses\nmore flexible, more useful.\nMake no mistake, more\nflexibility is an improvement in your chances\nwhen you graduate and\nstart looking for a good\njob.\nEDUCATION Education should benefit everyone \u2014 particularly those being educated.\nOne of the major points of\nthe \" Limits to Growth\" report of the group from\nMIT was that to achieve\na stable economy is to use\na much larger percentage\nof the gross national product for education. In this\ncontext it is our responsibility to press for more expansion in all areas of edu-cation, to press for equality of opportunity and\ntransfer methods between\ncourses to cater for\nchanges of interest as the\ncourse progresses. The cutbacks in the White Paper\nentitled \"Education: a Framework for Exp an sion\" (the exact opposite\nof its contents), are thoroughly deplorable.\nN.U.S. We should be able to\nfurther our aims through\nNUS.A s a national union,\nits negotiating power, and\nThe days when an Insurance Manager wept as a student entered his office are fast disappearing.\nTrue, the odd one or two still want to insure themselves to drive a hearse backwards to Basutoland,\nbut the rapid growth of student interest in life\nassurance is the main reason for the new benign\nattitude now pervading insurance circles.\nAnd the student interest in life assurance really\nhas grown. At a conservative estimate TWENTY MILLION POUNDS of life assurance is bought by\nundergraduates each year.\nI believe it is not nearly enough.\nI know that nearly 9 0 per cent of male undergraduates will take out a life assurance policy\nbefore they are 2 7 or so. I am sure that if they all really knew the good hard economic reasons why they should do it now \u2014 most of them would. Let me spell these out.\nThe younger you start a policy the cheaper it is\nthe provision of services\nlike Travel and Insurance,\nare far greater than any\ncollege union can muster\nof its own accord. It is an\nadvantage to be associated with NUS: if we disagree with its policies,\nthen we can campaign to\nchange and improve them.\nThe NUS has very cumbersome machinery, but\nI.C. has in the past been\namong the leading exponents of improved pro-ce dure s, a trend we would\nlike to continue. To bury\nour heads in the sand leads\nnowhere.\nCOMMUNITY ACTION Community action is an\narea in which this union\nis taking the lead in im proving the community as\na whole. As such, and together with Eco-action it\nshould have the greater\nfinancial support from the\nunion.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS Twenty per cent of our\nstudents are from overseas\nand at present have no\nrepresentative on council.\nThis must be rectified if\nwe are to help them effectively to fight any further\nincreases in their fees, at\npresent too high anyway.\nUNION FEE At present the Union\nreceives \u00a38.50 for each\nfull-time student. With rising costs (don't say you haven't noticed!) the\nUnion might soon be as\nimpoverished as its individual members. The per-capita fee should be in creased to a level so\nthat expanded programmes can take place. It is\nnot sufficient merely to in crease the Union income\nto cover rising costs.\nVOTE If you support our aims\noutlined here we ask you\nto reflect it by voting.\nAllnutt for President and\nArmitage for secretary.\nPlease feel free to\napproach us on any point\nyou wish to discuss.\nVote for the other candidate if you prefer his\nviews, but vote. This\nmakes a democratic union.\nROB ARMITAGE SIMON ALL NUT T and the cheaper it stays. Once your rate for the\npolicy has been agreed it cannot be increased, irrespective of inflation or any deter i or at on in your\nhealth. A student of 19 would pay with one leading\ncompany \u00a330.00 per annum for a \u00a34,000 life policy\n(the student average). A graduate of 2 7 would pay \u00a340.50 per annum for the same thing (if the\nrate remained the same in these inflationary times).\nOver 2 0 / 3 0 years, the saving runs into hundreds\nof pounds.\nThe next reason why could involve a saving of\nthousands of pounds.\nThe brokers operating in the student field tend\nto recommend very good contracts, if only on the\ngrounds that a student client today is a( rich) graduate client tomorrow and by then he will be more\naware and show his appreciation or otherwise by\nplacing his business with the broker he knows and trusts. My own company write many millions of\npounds worth of business each year from our thousands of graduate clients.\nThe choice of policy is most important. In 1 9 7 2\nthe pay out difference on two policies \u2014 for identical\noutlays \u2014 was \u00a32,949. That is 2,949 reasons for\ntaking the advice of a good broker. Once removed\nfrom university you will be up against many hard\nselling insurance concerns which might mean less\ngood advice.\nA good broker will also be able to help you to\nbuy that house you will want soon after graduation.\nTaking a life policy now is only the first step. It\ncarries no guarantee, but my own company is daily\narranging mortgages for our graduate clients. I have every reason to believe that several other\ninsurance brokers in the student field-are also providing this service.\nWorthwhile policies for students can begin from\n20p per week and if you could forego the odd pint\nor packet of cigarettes it is in your own interest to\nseriously consider embarking upon your future\nfinancial planning now. Consultation with a broker,\npreferably one who is either a member of the\nAssociation or Corporation of Brokers would be a useful starting point, as professional standing carries with it professional responsibility.\nA.

    "content": "Page 6\nFELIX February 27th,1973 Nemesis\nWe've been talking a good deal lately about\nmon ev \u2014where to get it, what to spend it on, what\nnot to spend it on, and\u2014well, it's been mainly\nabout acquiring the stuff.\nBut just supposing you've been wise enough to\nfollow all the advice handed out in these columns,\nand have got some cash and spent it wisely.\nThe next problem is to prevent the Income Tax\nman from taking a large part of it back.\nYou want to know how best to avoid this painful\nprocess. The answer\u2014as it so often is\u2014is to find\ngood professional advice. And that means an\naccountant.\nSo what is an accountant? Do you think immediately of Bob Cratchitt, high-legged stools and quill\npens?\nWell, this week, our expert Derek E. Cummings,\ntakes a look at an important section of the financial\ncommunity.\nThere are two certainties about being born into\nthis world these days. One is that, sometime, you are going to die. The other is that, sometime, you\nare going to have to pay taxes.\nBoth are fairly morbid thoughts and at first\nglance there is not a great deal you can do about\nthem. Certainly not the first, anyway. But the\nsecond, well, perhaps there is something to be done\nabout that.\nIn the first place, you have to consider how to\npay as little tax as possible, while remaining \u2014 of course \u2014 strictly within the i aw. There is a fine difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion.\nThe major difference is that you can go to jail for\nevading tax, but avoiding the pain of paying more\nthan you have to is perfectly legitimate.\nAnd this, unfortunately, is where the average\ntaxpayer gets into a kind of Alice in Wonderland situation. Unless you know the way around, it's a pretty impossible puzzle to try to untangle.\nThere are so many laws, so many rules, so many\nexceptions, so many legal loopholes that even the\nbrightest taxpayer will easily become confused,\ndepressed \u2014 and probably over-taxed.\nMost tax experts will cheerfully admit that a large percentage of British taxpayers are paying\nmore tax than they should. This usually arises because the individual is unaware of certain items for which he might claim tax exemption. And it's not surprising, when you\nconsider the way the taxation laws are arranged\nin this country, under which the onus is always \u2014\nalways \u2014 on the taxpayer to prove his status to the\nInland Revenue.\nYOU fill in your tax returns. YOU state whatever\nclaims for tax relief you think you are entitled to.\nYOU must prove the claim to the tax man. YOU have to find out what it is you are entitled to.\nThe Inland Revenue will never advise you, unless\nyou are prepared to make an issue of it and go to\nyour local Inspector of Taxes and pore through the\nlaw with him line by line. And most people have\nneither the time nor the inclination to do that.\nWhat many people do is to pay an accountant to\nmake their tax returns. Their rationale is that al though it costs a little money to put their finances\nand tax affairs into the hands of an accountant, the\nlikelihood is that he will save them money in the\nlong run, by reducing their tax bill.\nThe logic of it is that if the accountant saves\nyou just one pound more than the bill he charges,\nyou are ahead of the game.\nFor anyone who objects to paying more tax than\nis necessary \u2014 and that surely includes everyone \u2014\nit'san idea worth thinking about.\nWhat, then, is an accountant?\nIn the first place the title is something of a mis-no mer. These days, an accountant does a great deal\nmore than make up accounts. He has to have a good knowledge of the theory and practice of bus i ness: he has to be familiar with the workings of the\nstock exchange: he must know company law and the\nlegal involvements of such things: and he has to\nknow all there is to know about taxation.\nIn short, a good accountant is a kind of mathematical lawyer. A guide and interpreter for the layman.\nClearly, such a man can be of immense value\nwhenever you are involved in any kind of financial\nsituation \u2014 as, indeed, we all are from the moment\nwe start earning money and paying taxes on it.\nOf course, if and when the time comes, you will need to choose a good accountant. The most\nreliable guide to this is to look for a chartered\naccountant, and the post-nominal initials ' A.C.A.'. This indicates that the name on the plate belongs\nto a man who has passed the searching examinations set by the Institute of Chartered Accountants.\nNaturally, these qualifications will not necessarily\nexclude fools and knaves, but it is a worthwhile\nindicator. After all, anyone at all can call himself\nan accountant and set up in business with no\nqualifications whatever.\nAnd how does an accountant himself define his\nwork? I talked to a chartered accountant about it.\nLike doctors, accountants are forbidden by their\ncode of conduct to advertise, so his remarks must\nremain anonymous.\n\"I suppose the best definition of an accountant's work,\" said he who shall be nameless, \" is to say\nthat we offer a translation service. So much of the\nlaw relating to business and taxation is quite in comprehensible to the layman that without expert\ninterpretation he has no chance of understanding\nit.\n\"I would agree that vast numbers of people do pay more income tax, for example, than they really\nneed to. In most cases, it amounts to shillings and it would therefore not be worth paying pounds to\ncome to one of us to correct the assessment.\n\" But the thing is that unless you are familiar\nwith the law relating to taxation, you can never be\nsure what it is you are entitled to claim for. There\nCONGRATULATIONS\nI'd like to offer my congratulations to those wonderful crusaders who removed all those unsightly publicity\nnotices around college advertising the national grants\ndemonstration. It was an utter disgrace that students\nshould display notices advertising a demonstration on\nsuch an unworthy cause as student grants. It was good\nto survey the thoroughness with which every single\nposter was disposed of from their places of erection,\nincluding student noticeboards.\nThe most clever part of it was the way in which\nthe authorities disclaimed all knowledge of having removed them and their method of confusing students\nas to where they were allowed-to put up notices and\nwho was pulling them down.\nAt least some people have got the strength of mind\nto stand up to student propaganda; who knows, one\nday students might even get organised and begin to\nthink . . . or even start discussing POLITICS( ghastly\nword). Obviously we can't tolerate such things: after\nall, think of the effect that silly student pranks like\ndemonstrations could have on the cutback in education expenditure. We mus n't have them disturbing the\npeace just because they don't think their grant is high\nenough, let alone rational is at ions or refectory price in creases (such topics are, after all, way above their\nheads).\nProf. Ford (whoops, let it slip), Mr. Seaford and\n(signed) An admirer of the mighty crusaders.\nCompany.\nReactionary Jacks ( MR A) P.S.I hope Mr. Seaford will give the male cleaners\na bonus for the extra work involved (including danger\nmoney for going up ladders to a height of 20 feet or\nmore) for taking down the posters rather than getting\nin contact with the individuals involved who (horrible\nblok es) actually gave an undertaking to remove the\nposters on Wednesday after the demonstration. A few\nmore students might have read those bills; that would\nhave been a bit silly.\nP.P. S. Why not censor the student notice boards all\nof the time, not just some of it?\n(Name and address of contributor supplied)\nis no provision for the Inland Revenue to point out\nthings like that to the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer's own responsibility to find out. And that takes a good\ndeal more dedication than most people are prepared for. On the other hand, accountants are\ntrained to look for such items.\n\" And there is one other thing which is well\nworth pointing out to anyone contemplating the\nidea of consulting an accountant, and that is not\nto leave it too late. If, for example, you think you\nare being over-taxed, take professional advice as\nsoon as you can, otherwise it can be a long and complicated business. Remember, the tax man does\nnot have to prove he is right, you have to prove\nhe is wrong.\n\" Of course, personal taxes are far from being\nthe most important element in our professional\nlives. Like legal men, we have to know a good deal\nabout most things in life. After all, when a man comes'to you to lay his financial affairs before your\neyes, he's showing you a lot of himself, which means that an accountant is deeply and personally\ninvolved in a wide range of men's doings.\n\" Oddly enough, a lot of the story-book image\nof accountancy still clings. Many people still see\nus sitting on high stools, adding columns of figures\nand entering them in ledgers with quill pens. But,\nlike many such images, it is a grotesquely inaccurate one.\n\" We have to be au fait with the most modern\nbusiness methods such as computers, cost-effective-ness programmes, company organisation and the\nwhole mass of law relating to monetary matters.\nBut it all boils down to one thing, really. Making money work to the best possible advantage of the\nclient while staying within the law.\" "

Amongst\nthese few was Doug Scott, a Nottingham schoolteacher, who, with climbing experience, in the Alps and the\nHindu Kush, was to assume the role\nof leader.\nBaffin Island is remote and consequently there was a great deal of\nopportunity to conquer the un climbed peaks\u2014sheer rock pinnacles rising\n6,000 feet from the sea. The rock\nclimbing there is of high technical\ndifficulty and it was a serious undertaking to attempt an original route up\na rock face, from which retreat was\nsometimes impossible. The weather\nin this part of the world is savage and\nnot in the least conclusive toward\noutdoor activity in any form. Fierce\nsnow storms may arise within hours\nof a spell of fine weather. Unlike the\nAlps, one does not have the comforting thought that one may be extricated f ram an unpleasant situation by\nhelicopter rescue. Here the mountaineer is on his own with only his\nwits and skill as his tools for sur-viva l. Because of its isolation, the expedition required a fair amount of organisation and capital. It was originally\ndecided that the size of the expedition would be limited to a group of\nclose friends, amongst whom, competitive climbing and ego-tripping\nwould cut no ice. The intentions were\nnoble but they soon ran into practical difficulties \u2014 mainly lack of\nfunds. This problem could only be\nresolved by increasing the size of the\nexpedition to include big names of\nthe mountaineering world such as\nphotographer, Mick Burke. A film\nwould be made for the John Players'\ncigarette firm, in return for financial\naid.\nScott returned from Baffin Island\nand almost immediately set off for the\nHimalayas on the abortive International Everest Expedition. He returned to Baffin Island in the summer\nof 1972 and many more peaks were\nascended.\nImperial College Mountaineering\nClub presents Doug Scott on Tuesday, the 27th February. Extracts from\nthe Players' film and slides will be\nshown illustrating some of the exhilarating climbs achieved by the party\non both trips.\nDoug Scott, Lecture Theatre A, College Block, Imperial College,\nPrince Consort Road, Tuesday, February 27, 7.45 p.m.25 p at door.\nC. Brown, I. C.M. C. GOD THE MAN PAN SCIENCE FICTION\nJoseph Green, 30p For science fiction fans this novel\nis a real gem.\nMankind is threatened with extermination by a race of 300-foot high\naliens from another star system, but\nno one can understand why these\ncreatures have developed such an\noverwhelming desire to destroy us.\nFortunately, one of these super giants\nis captured alive but. his brain is\nseverely damaged by oxygen star va tion.\nEarth at this stage in her development has created two super humans,\nhumans with enlarged and improved\nbrains, one of them is Russian, the\nother American. Petrovna, the older\nand more experienced of the pair decides to remove the tiring giant's now\nuseless brain and install himself inside the head and from there with\nthe help of control mechanisms return the giant to his home planet and\ndiscover the meaning behind the fanatical attacks on earth. Gold becomes involved in the plot when\nPetrorna discovers that he is not physically well developed to be able to\noperate the keyboard of the computer in the brain fast enough the\nsimulate the realistic giant move-ment.\nThe story becomes even more incredible when eventually the giant\nreturns home and through his eyes\nviews their gigantic planet.\nTOWARDS INFINITY\nPAN SCIENCE FICTION\nEdited by Damon Knight, 35p The usual collection of S.F. stories\nsome very good like \"March Hare\nMission\", some bad like \"The Man\nWho Lost the Sea\". This really is\nnot the sort of book that I enjoy, the\nstories only just seem to be beginning\nwhen suddenly they stop \u2014 abruptly\nand leave you gasping, waiting for\nmore. This is all very well once \u2014\nbut nine times . . .!\nThis collection contains some well\nknown names in the field of S.F.: Ray Bradbury, Isaac Ascmor, A. E.

Yes? Do you want to know\nwhat you'll be like in 20 years? If\nyou do, go and see 'Last of the RedHot Lovers'. Alan Arkin is Barney, a nice 45-year-old person, who has a nice fish restaurant in a nice district,\nnice friends, a nice wife and a nice\nhouse. He has also nice morals and\nnice habits\u2014in fact the whole of his\nlife is nauseatingly nice. So Barney\ndecides to explore an extramarital\naffair just for the experience. He\nreckons that just one liaison will give\nhis life that missing ingredient, so\nthat on his deathbed he can look back\non that brief engagement and think\u2014\n'well, I did it, once.' Unfortunately\nBarney is not fortunate at all in his\nrelationships. Apart from being handicapped by having to use his mother's sterile apartment, and by being restricted to only a couple of hours in\nwhich to make out, his choice in\nwomen-friends is unfortunate, to say\nthe least. The first is a married\nwoman who comes to his fish restaurant four times in one week, and is\nonly, interested in the animal lust bit.\nThat upsets Barney. Strike one. The\nsecond one is an attractive young\nfailed singer, who besides having a persecution complex, is thoroughly\ndegenerate and paranoid. That also\nupsets Barney. Strike two. The third\nis one of his married friends who\nmakes a pass at him at a party, because she is upset at the gossip that\nher husband is having an affair. She\nis frigid, neurotic and has a habit of\ndiscussing their affair at the top of\nher voice in restaurants. Poor old\nBarney\u2014strike three and out.\n\"JEREMIAH JOHNSON\" Superficially \"Jeremiah Johnson\"\nbears a strong resemblance to one of\nthose Walt Disney 'Nature' films.\nThere is the same central 'mountain-trapper' type figure, and there are\nthe same superb, sweeping shots of\nthe massively beautiful Rocky Mountains scenery. The film fits in strongly\nwith a certain eternal American\nmood \u2014 the desire to be somewhere\nelse and to 'up and away' from the\ncity.\nBut this Disney 'image' disappears,\nfor Johnson (heavily-bearded Robert\nRedford) is a very real character. At\nthe beginning of the film he is utterly\ninexperienced, and often seems near\nperishing in the winter snows. But he\nlearns, and in this is the fascinating\npart of the film, for all the time we\nfeel that the Crow Indians are watch-ing, and that his existence continues\nAlan Arkin (of 'Cath-22') is here\nrecreating the type of role Jack Lemmon made famous a few years ago \u2014\nthe slightly neurotic, but very ordinary American, who finds himself way\nout of his depth in circumstances he\ncannot cope with. It is a scaled-down\ncharacter role, if you like. I am not\nsure if he is as adaptable as Jack\nLemmon, but he is just as convincing.\nSally Keilerman (of 'Mash') and Paula\nPrentiss (of various bad movies) as\ntwo of his girlfriends are given a wide\nscope of moods and do very well in-deed. The dialogue is typical scaled-up T.V. Situation Comedy stuff, predictable at times, but occ asian ally priceless. The film as a whole starts\noff very well, but tails off by the third\nliaison, mainly because everything's been said, and the ending is rather\npredictable as well. I reckon it's the\nkind of film vo u either like or hate,\ndepending on whether you like Americans in general or their humour in\nparticular. However, don't expect any\nwild action to match the X Certificate,\nbecause there isn't any\u2014it seems to\nme to be standard A A material. Perhaps the morals are dubious, but\nhow it can be classified in the same\ncategory as 'Last Tango in Paris' (no\nI haven't seen it yet), I don't know.\nStill, for 100 mins of mental ti till a tion, it does quite well.\n'Sergei'\nFootnote\u2014\nFor those people who didn't see\nKenneth Williams on 'Parkinson' a couple of weeks ago, I must repeat\nhis definition of critics (no love lost\nbet wen them and Ken)\u2014He reckons\nthey are like eunuchs in a harem.\nThey are there every night, see it\ndone every night, but can't do it\nthemselves.\nonly by their consent.\nThe last part of the film, however,\nis very different, for Johnson's revenge against the Indians (wholly\njustified), and their subsequent hunting of him is violently primeval, leaving Jacobean Revenge Tragedies far\nbehind. This is Johnson's testing\nground, and, at the end of the film\nhe emerges triumphant as the Crow\nChief accepts him in a final gesture\nof peace, caught in a poignant frozen-frame.\nTry as I can, I can find no fault in\nthis film. Redford's performance is\nsuperb, especially in the early 'Jack\nLondon' style of sequences, the\nmusic, which consists of Western\nballads, fits exactly, and I can remember no film that I have enjoyed\nso much for a long time.\nDavid Gurney.\n\n"

    "content": "February 27th,1973 FELIX65,000 STUDENTS ON THE STREET\nStaff Reporter\nLast Wednesday according to the NUS65,000 students marched, in7 regional centres around\nthe country, in protest\ndemanding a living grant.\nIn London 15,000 students from the southern\nregion led by the IC contingent marched from\nMalet St. to the DES across Waterloo bridge.\nThe wet and miserable\nweather which continued\nfor most of the afternoon\ndampened them but not\ntheir enthusiasm in the\nfight for higher grants.\nIn Malet St. the police\nsplit the demo into two\nsections and the first half\nled by IC set off for the\nDES with the second half\n200 yards behind. By the\nAldwych the two halves\nhad joined up and continued to the DES, chanting\nslogans and handing out\nleaflets to passers-by. At the DES the demo went to\nan area on the south bank\nto listen to speakers from\nthe NUS and various\ntrade unions.\nARREST The first half of the\ndemo had hardly gone\n200 yards from Malet St.\nwhen a police inspector\nthreatened to arrest the\nwhole demo unless they\nwalked five abreast. Not having a megaphone he\nwent unnoticed and the\nstudents continued to fill\ntheir lane as before.\nRound the corner out\nof sight of Malet St. I saw six policemen disguised as short-haired\npseudo trendy students\nstep out of a police van\nand join the march, they\nwere easily recognisable\nhowever as they were the\nonly people on the march\nholding large black regulation police umbrellas.\nNON ARRIVAL Among the speakers\nwho were going to address\nthe students was Roy Hattersley (Labour MP). He was being driven to the\nsouth bank to make his\nspeech when he saw some\nstudents leaving the area,\ninformed sources told me,\nassuming the rally to be\nover he turned round and\nleft for St. Pancras to\ncatch a train out of Lon don. No representative\nfrom the Labour Party\nturned up.\nINAUDIBLE Unfortunately the Public Address system obtained by the NUS had\nhad its speakers spread\nround the perimeter,\nwhich was fine for the\npeople spread round the\nperimeter, but those nearest the speaker's platform\ncould not hear any of the\nspeeches. The students\nnearest the platform frustrated at not hearing anything started to heckle,\ndemanding a march on Parliament and death to\nfascist NUS bureaucrats.\nJudy Cotter (President\nU LIES A) said that they\ncouldn't do that as it was\nnot on the agenda.\nSCUFFLES A cameraman from\nABC news got up on the\nspeakers' platform and\nfilmed a cameraman from\nthe Beeb who was standing near the platform\nfilming the ABC news\ncameraman filming him.\nThis accounts for the scarcity of film of the demo\non the television news that\nnight \u2014 10 seconds was\ndevoted to it by the BBC. Some demonstrators near\nthe platform tried to pull\nout a wire powering the\ncamera but were restrained by others. Soon,\nowing to lack of inspiration from the inaudible\nspeeches, students started\nto drift away and the\ndemo dispersed remarkably quickly.\nSUMS WRONG Although the NUS claimed a turn-out of\n15,000, the police estimate\nwas 7,000 and this was\nechoed by the television\nnews, and all national\ndailies the morning after,\nexcept the Guardian\nwhich printed both fig-ure s. Felix abacus operators counted 12,000, of\nwhich 500 were from IC.\nIt is the police that\nchoose the route the demo\nwill follow and the final\nplace of the rally. They\nassured us that the area\non the south bank where\nthe rally took place could\nhold 20,000 and it was\npacked, all bar a small\narea behind the speaker's platform.\nThe turn-out from Sussex university was disappointing \u2014 only 20 pe o ple, but the contingents\nfrom poly s and non-university colleges represented a far bigger percentage than from IC.\nLast year (in fine weather)\n800 people from TC took\npart in that anti-Thatcher/\nGilbert Longden registration of student unions\ndemo and that bill was\npostponed. Don't forget\nthe NUS National Day of\nAction for the Grants\nCampaign on March 14th \u2014 be sure to give it your\nsupport or students may\nnot escape this time.\nCOMMENTS Editorial\n10 per cent of students showed their solidarity at Wed nes day's demonstration. As a show of solidarity it was\npathetic and unconvincing. As a vehicle for canvassing\npublic support it failed miserably, at least partly through the\nlack of people along the chosen route. It would be pure\npipe-dreaming to imagine that it had any effect on the\nGovernment's attitude.\nYet the aims of the Grants Campaign are good and justifiable. No student can deny that, any more than a properly-informed public could. The main need now is for public sympathy. The public\nhave been led to believe that students are (and you've heard\nit all before) a bunch of long-haired, shoddily-dressed lay-about s, who spend their time drinking, smoking pot and\nengaging in orgies. However much you may believe that\npicture to be true, the public needs to be told of the other\nside of a student's life \u2014 \u2022 studying (yes, studying) and\nsurviving. No demonstration will do that. For not only\nare the public bored with demonstrations, but so are students\n(witness the 10 per cent turnout).\nYet demonstrations are just about the only public relations exercise (other than strikes) that the NUS and the rest\nof the student leadership can conceive of. High IQ's don't seem to breed originality. All students fall in the top 5 per\ncent of the population, intelligence-wise.\nWe need to show our intelligence by having an intelligent\nand original campaign \u2014 not by resorting to the pointless\nmethods of the trades unions.\nSo let's raise a cheer for the Scottish region of the NUS \u2014\nBritain's only functioning NUS area \u2014 who decided that\ndemos were no good weeks ago. Instead of having a march\nand rally last Wednesday, like all the other areas, they em barked on a mass public education campaign.\nThey called for 4 0 0 articulate students from all over\nScotland to come to Edinburgh on Wednesday to be fully\nbriefed on the Grants Campaign, then to be turned loose on\nPrince's Street (Edinburgh's equivalent of Oxford Street) to\ngo up and talk to passers-by about it. In the event, 1,200\nstudents turned up, vast numbers of the public eventually\nexpressed their support, and they got the best Press of any\nof the 11 regional \" centres of activity\".\nSurely this is the sort of action that students should be\ntaking. Responsible and intelligent action. And it's the\nsort of thing we should be doing on the Day of Action which take's place a fortnight tomorrow.\nNow that Oxford Street is nearly a pedestrian precinct,\nit'side aly suited to the purpose. It's one hell of a sight\nbetter idea than going on strike, which is the NUS line . . .\nall that'll get us is a bad Press and a worse public reaction.\nWe're students because we've got brains \u2014 let's use\nthem!\nJohn Lam\nLast week's grant demonstrations were a very substantial\nsuccess. Over 10 per cent of the NUS membership were\ninvolved in them. This represents by far the biggest national\naction ever taken by students \u2014 in some regional centres\nthe turnout was three times that of last year over the \" autonomy\" issue. In organising the London demo, we had hoped\nfor 10,000. With the rain and cold weather, prospects did\nnot look too good on the day. In fact, well over 15,000\nmarched \u2014 the colleges of education and FE colleges being\nparticularly strong. The mass media made themselves\nrather ridiculous by saying 7,000 ( BBC& ITN News) right\nup to the late night news on BBC2 which (after a recount?)\nsuddenly decided on 15,0001 But we can thank the media\nfor the excellent coverage of the IC contingent!\nGOVERNMENT REACTION The question remains. What will the Tories do about all\nthose tens of thousands of unruly students shouting nasty\nthings at their windows, withholding their rents or having\ncatering boycotts? After the meeting between NUS and the\nGovernment on March1 st we should be a bit clearer. Their\nmost likely reaction will be to concede something but do it\nin such a way as to divide the student movement.\nFor instance, they could introduce subsidies for halls and\nrefectories. The idea would be that students in hall would\nstop the rent strike campaign, leaving the rest in the lurch\nfacing increasing rents in private accommodation on the\npresent grant. Or they could give everybody a small increase but do nothing about the basic in just ici es involved\nin the discretionary award system with the hope of buying\noff the majority of students with small carrots. If students\nare in a frame of mind which allows them to be divided\nfrom each other there are an unlimited variety of tactics\nwhich the Government could use.\nTHE MARCH14 th DAY OF ACTION If the Tories reject our claim out of hand, or attempt\nto divide the NUS, there must be solid united reaction\nfrom every college in the country.\nThe Grants Campaign co-ordinating committee are therefore calling for a National Strike on March14 th with the\naim of closing down totally the higher education system for\none day.\nThis is the first EVER national strike called by NUS and\nif we are serious about defending the living standards of\nboth ourselves and future generations of students it must\nbe a success. It should not be seen as similar to an industrial strike \u2014 the effect on the economy is insignificant. It\nis, however, probably the most effective form\" of demonstrating our unity and determination.\nOrganising the strike will require a large number of activists and widespread support from the ordinary union members. If it is a success, the government will know that, given\nan issue on which students feel strongly enough, we're capable of organising the same again. in other words, by\nstriking on March14 th we are saying to the G cw n ment that unless they maintain our living standards and give all\nstudents the full grant they cannot expect anything but\ncontinual trouble in higher education.\nHOW MUCH SHOULD\nYOU EARN ?\nLast week I bought nothing out of the ordinary, I went on no enormous spending spree and I didn't travel anywhere\na great distance from here. Nevertheless, I managed to\noverspend on my grant by nearly20 per cent. I 'll agree that\nI wasn't being particularly careful, but I wasn't being in the\nleast extravagant and it was quite a shock to discover just\nhow much I had spent.\nAt least this year I'm relatively lucky; I'm living in hall. When I go out into the big wide world of privately owned\naccommodation I 'll have to pay at least \u00a36 a week merely\nto have a roof over my head. I 'll also have to pay this for\n3 9 weeks a year so that the room will be held over the\nEaster and Christmas vacations. If you add in the cost of\nfeeding myself during term it's quite obvious that the\nnotional element of \u00a3 2 7 5 for board and lodgings in the\ngrant is hopelessly inadequate.\nWell, why don'tI get a job? Yes, I suppose that's quite\nfeasible and probably a good idea for the first year. But\nwhat about the second and third years? Only the geniuses\nwill find that they don't need to study for a considerable\nperiod of the vacation. Anyway, I'm already doing a job.\nI'm studying to become a more useful member of society\nso why should I have to take a second job in order to sur-vive? I think I deserve a better deal than I'm getting at\nthe moment.\nI don't suppose, however, that James Fenner would agree\nwith me. He thinks that when you deserve a pay rise you\nget it without having to ask. On that basis, I don't deserve\na higher grant because it hasn't been offered un demanded. Maybe if he had to live on what I do at the moment he\nmight admit he could be wrong.\nMr. Fenner stated in his letter last week that he \" would like to debunk the attitude of the lunatic left that students\nare workers\". I would very much like to know what he considers students to be if they are not workers. It seems to\nme that, like all other workers, they are selling their ability\nto execute particular tasks. That they are being trained\ndoes not alter this in the least. Apprentices are considered\nby their employers to be employed. They do not receive the\nfull rate for the job because they are not fully trained, but\nthen it could not be said that students receive anything like\nthe full rate for the sort of jobs they will do when they\nfinish their studies. Undoubtedly, it will be argued that the\ncourses run here are not necessarily vocational and thus this\nargument cannot be applied to us. Why then is it that\nemployers in many fields trample all over each other to\npersuade IC graduates to work for them. ( ? \u2014 Ed.). They, at least, must believe that the studies undertaken here offer\nsomething that cannot be obtained elsewhere.\nMr. Fenner seems to be even further out of touch with\nthe sort of average salary young graduates receive. I don't think that it can possibly be considered normal to triple one's salary in a period of five years. On that basis Mr. Fenner's annual salary when he retires should be in the region of\n\u00a3 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and there aren't very many people who earn\nthat much. I think also that Mr. Fenner may have been less than honest about the origin of the money he earned.\nHe does not state in his letter that he is in fact American, and that he was not working in this country when he was\nearning these enormous salaries. I have been told that,\nin the country where he was working, the average pay for\nthe job he was doing is much greater than it is here.By the way, I guess you all think I'm a member of the so called\" lunatic left\". Well, I'm not; and, if you don't believe me, you can ask anybody whom Mr. Fenner considers bel on gs to that faction. MICHAEL SILVER LEAF ACTION OR IN ACTION Probably the most important thing about March14 th is that\nwe should not all stay in our beds. There will be a national\nlobby of Parliament by delegates from all colleges on that\nday. A teach-in, alternative classes, discussion on wider\neducation issues, on the White Paper on Education, public\nleaf letting, publicity stunts \u2014 given numbers and imagination we can make a big public impact, stimulate students to\nthink more deeply about education and in general make it a real day of action and not just a\"Sleep In\".

The game that preceded this was won by the\nPoachers 2\u20141 after they were a goal down at half-time.\nThe game was extremely scrappy and after a hard\nnight I missed most of what happened \u2014 especially\ntheir two goals \u2014 so I 'll end this report by thanking\nW. B.,Ron( he is the pissed one), Rich and Dave for\nkeeping the I.C. flag flying in the surrounding pubs.\nOn the previous day the 1st XI played their penultimate league match against Smiths and lost 3\u20140. The\nonly comment about this match that reached me was\nthat it wasn't worth reporting. On the same day, the\nnever reported 2nd XI entertained G.W.R. lis and won\n1\u20140.\nSaturday's brilliant sunshine brought out the best\nin the 3rd XI players, who proceeded to record their\nthird win of the season. In order to give G.W.R. Ills a chance, I.C. turned up with only nine men.\nThe first half was fairly even with both sides creating chances, but neither getting on top. G.W.R. took\nthe lead mid-way through this half with a simple goal\nfollowing a bad defensive mistake. The second half\nwas completely different. Despite G.W.R' s. two man\nadvantage, I.C. completely dominated the game. Using\ntheir superior fitness (thanks to J.J.?)I. C. forced the\npace and eventually scored a very scrambled goal from\na goal mouth melee. Russ Eason was the scorer. The\nsame player scored the winner a few minutes later\nwhen he beat three players before putting the ball\ninto the empty net. At this stage G.W.R. were unable\nto raise their game and I.C. eventually emerged the\ncomfortable winners.\nTeam:- R. Bateman; D.M urch, C. Scott; J. Heffer,\nJulie, R. Critchley; W. Biggin, J. Preston, R. Eason.\nAs mentioned earlier Mr. Eason scored twice during\nthe match, his hat-trick being completed later that\nsame evening.\nWill all members please note that the annual dinner\nwill take place on Monday, March19 th. The price for\nthis nosh-up which will be followed by a grand drinking session in 414, is at the moment, set at \u00a32.40. For all of those who are bringing guests of the opposite\nsex, and who isn't,a double ticket is settling down at\n\u00a34.50.\nrowing Saturday the 10th February saw the I. C.1st VIII in action for the first time this year. The occasion was\nthe London Rowing Club Colleges Regatta. Although,\nas its name suggests, this is essentially a colleges event,\nLondon Rowing Club decided to enter two crews. One\nof which was their domestic 1st VIII, only lacking\nthe heavyweights of their continental regatta Grand\nVIII. The first heat saw I.C. caught in a hailstorm while\nwaiting on the start, as a result of which their new\nblue boat club sweat shirts spent the rest of the day in\nthe drying room and I.C. had to revert to their practice tops for the rest of the regatta. Q.M. C., the cause\nof the delay, only had 7 men and had had to pick up a spare man from London Rowing Club. In fact, they\nneed n't have bothered, as they, along with London R.C. II were left standing by I.C's. very powerful start.\nI.C. were in fact clear of both crews in the first twenty\nstrokes. Although I.C. did not row particularly well\nfor the rest of the race they beat London by about 4\nlengths and Q.M. C. by 7 lengths.\nIn the Semi-Final I.C. met Churchill College, Cam bridge. In rough water I.C. went clear in the first minute and finally won by 4 lengths.\nAlthough I.C. had won all their heats easily they\nnever rowed particularly well together and it was with\nsome doubts that they went into the final against\nLondon R.C. I.C's. powerful start gave them.f length in the first\nminute but they did not settle together in the middle\nof the race and could not go clear. Their lack of\ncohesion in the rough water coupled with the fact that\nthey had had one more race than London, began to\ntell even on this very fit crew. In the closing stages\nLondon rowed through f.C. to win by 1 length.\nThe result is very promising indeed for the boat\nclub. All the other college crews were well beaten, and\nthe very next day the same London crew were easily\nheld over 7. mins. Even more promising have been some\nof the other practice outings, in which I.C. have beaten most of the other tide way clubs. The highlights of\nthe practice rows were I.C's. defeat of Isis (the Oxford\nuniversity 2nd VIII, thought by many to be very good\nthis year) by 1/3 length over 2 mins., and the defeat\nof Tyrian, the U.L.2 nd VIII by 2 lengths over a3 min. row.\nThe indications are that this could be one of the\nboat clubs best seasons for many years.\nCENTRE POINT began\nas an experiment on December 16th,1969, in\nthe disused basement of\nSt. Anne's House, Soho,\nwhose front door is in\nDean Street, next to the\nbomb site which was\nonce St. Anne's Church. The entrance to Centrepoint is in Shaftesbury\nAvenue, through some romantic iron gates, and\nthe decaying churchyard,\npassed unnoticed by\nthousands of people every day. It began here,\nright in the heart of the\nWest End (the centre\npoint) because this was\nwhere a number of\ngroups were working, especially with drug a bus ers. Among them was\nFather Kenneth Leach at\nSt. Annes', trying to help\npeople who are very se v3r elly disturbed, many irreparably so. He wat c hed young people drawn to the WestEnd like\nmoths to a candle, al most inevitably to be\nburnt, and he longed to\nfind some way of saving\nsome of them from the\nfamiliar syndrome: no\nmoney, nowhere to\nsleep, \" vagrancy\", petty\ncrime, drugs and the\nprostitution of both boys\nand girls.\nThe experiment \u2014 initially for three months \u2014\naimed to provide newcomers with first aid:a place to sleep, something to eat, someone to\ntalk to, and advice especially about how to\nfind work and accommodation. It hoped to give\na few of them a chance\nto settle in London with out being damaged by\nit, or to go home again,\nor to do whatever it was\nthat \u2014 by the time they\nreached Centre point \u2014\nthey really wanted to do.\nCentrepoint is unique\nin London in providing\nemergency ac com mod ation completely free,\nevery night of the year.\nFifteen to twenty young\npeople have come in\nevery night and there\nhave been some fifteen\nthousand admissions since the centre opened.\nIt now has a full time\nprofessional social worker as a director \u2014 David Nair n \u2014 but, other than\nthat, it is entirely staffed\nby volunteers. Imperial\nCollege Catholic Society\nsend two volunteers every night \u2014 they work on\na fortnightly rota \u2014 to work there, and organised a long sponsored\nwalk through the Sussex\nWeald on Saturday. The aim was to raise money\nfor Centrepoint House, a short term hostel the organisation is to set up at\nBaron's Court. It will house fourteen residents\nand offer those who use\nit a supportive address\nwhilst they work and find\nother accommodation during their non-working\nhours. The average expected length of stay\nwill be a fortnight. Un fortunately no space was\navailable for this article\nin our last issue, so we\ncould not urge you to\nsponsor a walker. Nevtheless, Centrepoint still\nneeds donations \u2014 in all, they need \u00a310,000. If\nyou can, send a few\npence. More details can\nbe obtained from Joseph Cullen, Me ch Eng PG, who is organising the\nCathsoc contingent to\nCentrepoint.\nrapid rambles\nHyde Park Road\nRelay\nIf you were by the Al bert Memorial on Saturday afternoon, you may\nhave wondered at the\nemergence of some500 be track suited people from the Union. The occasion for all this activity was the 25th Hyde Park Road Relay organised in time-honoured\n(and sometimes cursed)\ntradition by Imperial College in its manifestation\nas the Cross Country\nClub in general, and\nSteve Webb, Pete John son, Neil Boa g and Rob Parker in particular.\nMany thanks to all\nthose who braved the\nweather (the odd snowflake or two) to help on\nthe day: the timekeepers\nand judges, the markers\n(in particular, we' ve been asked to mention\nthe \" lovely little lady\nfrom Loughborough\"... say no more Marshal Pad?), the results run-ner, Ian, who was on a bike. Dave Jones' results team (at one stage\nonly three) who sought\nto prove that arithmetic\nis not yet, in some\nsense, a lost art, some\nDram soc people for their\ntime and amplifier, and the ladies of Mooney who dished out the teas\nand without who m...At3o 'clock by the\ntraditional lamp - post,\nwhose number I 've for-gotten. Lord Penney,\narmed with the ACC Web ley( which worked),\nunleashed a straining\npack of some80 runners\ndown Rotten Row and around the 3 mile (al-most) course. First back\nwas J. Reade of Portsmouth Poly, but that\nglory didn't last long,\nslipping to second on the\nnext lap and later to\n26th. Borough Road College\nmanaged to win both the\ncups this year, instead\nof just their usual one\n(we only hope we'll see\nthe Lady Roderick Hill\ncup again!), in a time of\n8 5 min 3 0 sec. Bir ming ham University, winners\nfor the past two years,\nwere third, moving up\nslowly from 2 4 th after\nthe first lap. The fastest\nlap was run by Andy Mc Kean of Edinburgh University in 13 min,30 sec, 3 seconds short of\nthe lap record (his left\nleg was not much slow-er).\nOf course the result\nyou're all waiting for is\nthat of IC. We were 3 9 th. Rob All in son started us\noff well at 5 3 rd in 15\nmin 29 sec, and this\nposition was consolidated by Stuart Littlewood\n(15:56) and Dave Payne\n( 1 6 : 3 2 ) . The effect, however was somewhat\nspoiled by Joe Keating,\nwho picked up 14 places\nin a time of 14 min 37\nsec, returning so quickly\nthat he was the cause of\na hurried disrobe ment by our next runner Paul\nClarke, who did15 min\n49 sec. Our last runner\nwas Rob Parker, and\nleast said, soonest mend-ed. The overall time was\n9 4 min 59 sec.\nAfter the race Lady\nPenney was kind enough\nto present the medals to\nthe winning teams and individuals, and Steve\nWebb made a speech\nand got it right.\nAnd so, as the Union sank once more, for another year, into its\npeaceful slumber, a group of Belgian runners\nled by Foreign Teams\norganiser Pete Johnson( none other) joined the\nIC Team and half the\nother UK colleges in a certain house of refreshment in South Kensington. Hn nn!( that's French\nbut I guess those Belgians understand French).\n\n"
