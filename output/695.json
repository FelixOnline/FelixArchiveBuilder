    "content": "LSPORT\nLADIES RUGBY\nProp\nThis weekend brought a hectic\nschedule, after a two month\nbreak from rugby due to adverse\nweather conditions, cancellations and so on, with a match\nagainst Swansea on Saturday\nand Charing X and Middlesex\nHospital on Sunday.\nSwansea gave us an excellent\ngame with Nessie Yates making\nus look set for a victory early in\nthe game with a run away try.\nSadly 'twas not to be with\nSwansea's next five tries overshadowing our work concluding\nthe 20-4 defeat. However, the\nmatch was enjoyed immensely\nwith everyone eager to get back\ninto the game again.\nBy Sunday eagerness had\ndwindled with the aches, pains\nand obvious bruising becoming\napparent in the stance of the\nsecond day's turnout. Having\nTABLE TENNIS\nInter-hall\nTournament\nThe 1984/85 Interhall\nTabletennis Tournament is due\nto begin on Saturday 9 February.\nLinstead, Garden, Falmouth\nKeogh, Weeks and Selkirk Halls\nare among the participants and\nwill no doubt be producing some\nthrilling stuff over the next two\nweeks.\nEach hall team consists of\nseven players, seeded in order,\nand matches will be played\nbetween the same seed\nnumbers. Each match will be\nplayed on a best of three basis.\nThree points will be awarded for\na win and no points for a defeat.\nThe maximum number of\npoints that any one team can\nobtain is 84 (3x4x7) and the lucky\nteam to get closest to this figure\nwill be the championship winner.\nFurther details have already\nbeen sent out to the team\norganisers, and we shall\nendeavour to keep readers in\ntouch with the progress of the\ntournament over the coming two\nweeks.\nhad an experienced RFU referee\nthe previous day Sunday's match\ntook on a whole new meaning\nwith the Hospitals' make-shift\nreferee Mr 'Joker' Murphy. The\nHospital side achieved four tries\nwith some fast, way-practiced\nbackline play which we had\ntrouble stopping. Luckily our\ntrusty prop Ann 'The Tank'\nBurnhill bull dozed her way\nthrough their pack managing to\nout-run any attempts by the\nopposition to stop her much to\neveryone's surprise, to redeem\nourselves a little with a last\nminute try bringing the final\nscore to 16-4 . Well done also to\nAnn Parsons our other prop who\nexhibited some determination ed tackling and forward play.\nThanks to everyone who\nturned out especially those keen\nor stupid enough to appear both\ndays.\nAn appeal \u2014 intense training\nin technique is required in\npreparation for the national\ntournament at Keele (UAU) in\nMarch. Any offers please step\nforward.\nThe teams are (players in seed\norder):\nLinstead: L Fung, S RoyChowdhury, M Amechi, P Atherton, N Ahmad, M Young,\nA Aaghaakouchak\nGarden: MK Li, S Barnes, T Chung, K Khan, S Sadiq, J Scutts, TN Mambe\nFalmouth Keogh: G Cart, N Ting, J Stonham, D Henty, J Haworth, M Thompson, J Kaduk\nWeeks: O Dairo, A Wong, S Mansour, KF Chiu, P Stott, A Coope, P Withers\nSelkirk: R Ingham, A Cheung, M Tan, L Axelsson, T Papathanassiadis, Ting, A Powell\nBADMINTON\nall about\nnothing.\nBearing in mind the lugubrious\nfact that there have been no\nbadminton match reports for the\npast three weeks. I have decided\nto put all those fervid badminton\nmatch report readers (few as\nthey may be) out of their anguish.\nConsequently, you now have the\nnon-internationally ill us tio us speech, 'Alternative uses of a badminton racquet', by Mr\nChristopher Bean, IC Badminton Club Captain 1984/5.\nSNOOKER\nRevival\nLensbury B v IC 4\u20148 A series of\nindifferent results has left\nImperial dangerously close to the\nbottom of the league and it was\nimportant that this visit to\nLensbury, also under the threat\nof relegation, should provide a win.\nThe first eight frames were\nshaved and so with only four left\nto play both sides were still\nhunting the breakthrough that\nwould seal the match.\nFortunately it was IC that\nfound the inspiration. Adrian\nFeasby won both of his frames,\ncapturing one in style thanks to a break of 48. John West, having\nwon his first frame, struggled in\nthe second, however, while the\nrest of the team retired to the bar\nresigned to the fact that John\nhad lost the frame he staged a comeback and completed a very\nacceptable 8-4 victory for\nImperial.\nHopefully this match will\nprovide a platform from which\nwe can lift ourselves away from\nthe foot of the table and clear of\nthe possibility of relegation.\nJUDO\nFriendly\nDefeat\nLast Wednesday, the Judo Club\nwent to the LSE to fight a friendly\ncompetition.\nThe match was very close, but\nas one fight was lost on the\ndecision of a slightly partisan\nreferee, we lost the match by\nfour fights to three.\nOur team were Andrew\nBinding, Richard Blexham, Steve\nDavies, Nigel Scott, Phil\nTaphouse, Chris Weedon and\nGraham West.\nWe hope to have a return\nmatch against LSE in a few\nweeks, and to fight London\nHospital Medical School later in\nthe term.\nAnyone interested in the Judo\nClub should come to the Union\nGym between 6.30 and 9pm on\nTuesday, or in the Union bar\nafter 9pm. contact Kathy\nMarlchan, Chem Eng 3 or Chris\nDunn Maths 2.\nSAILING\nPink Team v London Hospital 2-0\nBlue Team v London Hospital 2-0\nCombined Team v Oxford 4-0\nOnce more the intrepid sailors\nset off with a somewhat depleted\nblue team. This did not however\ndeter our sturdy crew as the\nresults speak for themselves. It\nwas a beautiful sunny morning\nwith a gentle breeze. The first\ntwo matches against London\nHospitals went without mishap\nand we achieved several 1-2-3,\nresults. In the afternoon the wind\npicked up\u2014several boats\ncapsized. Ape successfully\nmaintained his record with tillers\nand before long it had broken.\nWith a makeshift replacement he\nhad no better luck and he and\nAndrea were soon experiencing\nthe delights of the Welsh Harp.\nPhil and Alison finally managed\nto toe them to shore and helped\nthem right their boat, we were\nthen ready to race Oxford. This\nwas quite exciting but proved a fairly easy victory. With the team\nworking together, the results\nwere almost always 1-2-3.\nRSMA\nCURRY SUPPER\nThe 2nd year supper will now be\nheld on February 13 at 6.00pm in\nthe MDR Sherfield, and not as\npreviously advertised.\nSUBWARDEN\nWANTED FOR\nLINSTEAD HALL First year PG preferred\nApplications in writing to Dr RH Clarke, Warden, Linstead\nHall by February 28\nEMERGENCY\nPUB BOARD\nAll members of the board should\nattend the meeting tonight at\n5.30pm in the Union Upper\nLounge.\n10 Friday 8 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ELETTERS;\nOUR\nCentenary\nDissent\nDear Sir,\nI note with interest that Maribel Anderson,\nwho ran her election campaign on the basis of\nproviding a union which would be more\naccessible to it's members now seems to\npreside over a union run by hacks for hacks.\nIt appears that the only City and Guilds\norganized event to fall within the three day\nperiod assigned to the Centenary\nCelebrations is the 'bar night', hardly a mass-appeal event. Neither the Masquerade Ball,\nwhich is a suitable event, nor the Banquet\nwhich is apparently fully booked by 'hacks',\nfalls into this period. However, once again IC\nEnts will be presenting a carnival.\nWith so little going on it seems ridiculous\nfor keen skiers to pass up this superb\nopportunity to take advantage of mid-season\nskiing conditions. The Ski Club will therefore\nbe making its travel funds available to any\nbourgeois members who wish to ski in\nScotland during this period.\nYours,\nP Drummond Smith\n(Ski Club Secretary)\nDear Sir,\nI have noticed a recent announcement that\nundergraduates in City and Guilds will be\ngiven three days holiday over the cent e nery celebration period.\nDoes this offer extend to postgraduates in\nCity and Guilds? They are after all,\nGuildsmen too.\nIf it does, what is being done for those\npostgraduates who must be in College for the\nperiod in order to show their laboratories off\nto the general public? Will they be granted\nthree days extra holiday for the year?\nWill they be offered demonstrating rates\nfor giving up three days of their research\ntime?\nI appreciate that undergraduates are in the\nmajority at IC, but that is no reason for\npostgraduates (who form approximately one\nthird of the student body) to be kept in the\ndark and ignored.\nYours quiz ic ally, Hugh Stiles\nChem Eng PG\nBrown's Terrorist\nDear Sir,\nI feel I Must respond to Graham Brown's letter published in last week's edition of\nFELIX, in which he attacked the ANC as a terrorist organisation, on par with the IRA.\nHad he taken the trouble to look up the\nword 'terrorist' in the dictionary, then he\nwould have found that a terrorist is 'one who\nrules by or practices intimidation'. Surely\nthen, the word 'terrorist' is more applicable\nto the South African government rather then\nthe African National Congress, since the\ngovernment, through its policy of apartheid\nwhich incidentally needs to be backed up by\nthe most powerful army on the African\ncontinent, denies even the most basic human\nrights to the majority of the countries\npopulation, excepting of course, those who\nhappen to be white who can enjoy one of the\nhighest standards of living in the world.\nShould the ANC be branded as a terrorist\norganist ion because with the support of over\nthree-quarters of the population of South\nAfrica, it is prepared to stand up to this\ndisgusting regime?\nAs Graham Brown is such a staunch\nadvocate of democracy, then how does he fail\nto realise that it is the ANC, and not the\ngovernment, that is the true voice of the\npeople of South Africa\u2014a fact which is\nrecognised even by the United Nations? The\nANC are committed to the introduction of a democratic system of government in South\nAfrica, in. which people of all races can\nparticipate and not to the continuation of the\npresent systems which is based on fear,\nintimidation and repression according to the\ncolour of one's skin. As the Freedom Charter\nadopted by the ANC thirty years ago, clearly\nstates, 'South Africa belongs to all those who\nlive in it, black and white, and no government\ncan justly claim authority unless it is based on\nthe will of the people.\nThere can be no democracy in South\nAfrica, and Namibia, until apartheid is not\nmerely reformed, but completly destroyed, it\nis only through the actions of such parties as\nthe African Nation Congress, and of the\nrecently formed United Democratic Front,\nthat this can ever be achieved.\nS Dunlop\nPhysics 1\nThanks\nDear Sir,\nLate on Saturday night in the ladies toilet\nin the Union Building, the rape alarm was\naccidentally set off. As a result within\nminutes three of the Union Barmen arrived.\nTheir prompt response was very reassuring\nand much appreciated, despite it being a false\nalarm.\nYours sincerely,\nLindsay Pratt (Maths 2)\nJenny Massicott (Physics 2)\nFELIX\nFirst of all let me apologise for this edition of\nFELIX being slimmer than usual, especially\ncompared with last week's bumper 20 pages.\nThis is due to our printer Tony being ill. We\nwere promised a temporary printer by a staff\nagency but he didn't turn up, leaving us in the\nlurch on Thursday. We hope that everything\nwill be back to normal next week.\nThe feature on sabbaticals this week (page 6)\nhighlights the fact that elections are looming.\nThe campus-wide ballot for next year's President, DP, Hon Sec and FELIX Editor is\non March 11 and 12, and nomination papers\ngo up on February 18.\nCandidates are allowed to put up posters\nand distribute handouts from 5.30pm on\nFriday 1 March when papers come down.\nManifestos will be published in FELIX on\nMarch 8.

Artwork for printing must be\nready by February 22 to ensure that posters\nare ready for distribution when papers come\ndown.

Me, I try to get a longer life span, though\nwhy, I don't know. Level zero or lower is\nwhere I'm going. The noises coming from\nsome of the rooms I passed revealed some\nother peoples choices\u2014frenzied screams\nfrom one, impassioned moans from another.\nMight as well go out with a bang eh? As I ran\ndown the stairs, I found out what some other\npeople has decided to spend their last, what\nis it now, two minutes doing. Prof Anderson\nsped past me\u2014using the quick route\ndown\u2014no stairs. Whats the point getting\nyou own back on lectures\u2014they'll be dead\nsoon anyway.\nCome to think of it, what's the point of a public four minutes warning anyway? There\nwas no place build up to this strike, so why\ntell us we've only got four minutes. Hardly\ntime to build a shelter is it? The guys who've\ngot shelters will be in them any way, so why\nnot let us all get vapor is ed without knowing\nits going to happen.\nLevel zero at least, and its pretty crowded.\nWhere's that man hole cover. Who know, if I get the right tunnel I might even make the\nbunker. Oh hell, only twenty seconds left.\nPerhaps the others were right about what to\ndo.\nHey. The sirens have stopped! Is that a voice I can hear?\n'The attacks-warning drill is now over.\nNormal business should be resumed as soon\nas possible. We wish to apologize for any\ninconvenience caused, and thank you for\nyour kind co-operation this day'...\nNot much news this week, library meeting\nThursday 1pm in the Green Committee\nroom as usual. If anybody would like to\ndonate any books to the Library we'd be\ngrateful.\nOur very own Science Fiction\nConvention, PICOCON Pi (as in 3.141596)\nwill hopefully take place towards the end of\nterm, with videos, silly SF based games and\nguest speakers. Also, as you may or may not\nknow, Arthur C Clarke's book 2010 has been\nfilmed. We are trying to get tickets for the\nfirst night. All interested should get names to\na library meeting as soon as possible so we\ncan book (if there are any seats left still).\nExpected date \u2014 early March.\nPS That bunch of small ad page\ndegenerates, PPS, the self styled Plasma\nPhysics Soc have challenged us to a game of\nCall my Bluff.

    "content": "f FELl X A Day in the Life Of... Ian Bull \u2014President\nFancy being a sabbatical? It's very\ndifficult to answer that without\nknowing what a sabbatical officer\nactually does.\nAs a special favour to everyone\ngleefully anticipating a free room\nin hall and a cushy job for a year,\nFELIX is providing a special cut\nout and keep guide to all your\nfavourite sabbaticals. And if\nyou're one of the thousands of IC\nstudents who aren't ICU hacks,\nthen hopefully you'll realise just\nhow much work is actually being\ndone on your behalf.\nI aim to get into the office by 9.30.\nThis leaves about three hours before\nlunch, which allows me to prepare\nfor the daily grind of committees. I might be checking the previous\nmeeting's minutes, or preparing a report. Other jobs need doing in the\nmornings. The President is\nresponsible for the permanent staff,\nfor instance. I had to recruit five staff\nover the summer, although I hope\nthat next year's President won't have\nthis to do.\nI have lunch at the Union Snack\nBar, and make sure that I'm around\nbetween 12.30 and 1.30, when people\ntend to come in with problems, or\npoints that they want to raise. If I don't have a committee meeting in\nthe afternoon then I could easily\nspend most of the rest of the day\nseeing to these and meeting\npersonnel at Sherfield. When you\nhave points to raise with people at\nSherfield then it's no good seeing\nthem for 30 seconds. You have to\nmake sure that you have a few things\nto see them about so you have to\nkeep a few things going at once.\nYou've got to have your facts right,\nand be sensible, as well as knowing\nwhen the interests of the students\ndemands that you put your foot\ndown.\nAfter 5-o clock there could be a Major Sub-Committee. If there isn't then I could go down to the bar, or\nhave a game of badminton.\nEven after you think the day is over\npeople approach you in the bar with\ncomplaints, or requests for autographed photos, so you're never\nreally off duty, even at weekends.\nSelf motivation is important for a President. Maybe in the past some\nhave lacked this. Being President\ndoesn't seem to do your employment\nprospects any great harm. You have\nto remember that it could be a long\ntime before you get that level of\nresponsibility again. I had a pretty\ngood idea of what the job entailed\nbefore I stood, although not as good\nan idea as I thought. I enjoy the job.\nMy advice to prospective candidates is 'Come and see me and\nfind out what the President really\ndoes'.\nEric Darbyshire\u2014 Hon Sec\nI tend to wake up at about 9 o 'clock,\nearlier if there's an Exec meeting,\nlater if I got pissed the previous night.\nAfter a breakfast of Weetabix I get\ninto the Union Office at about 10.\nTypically the first job is opening\nthe mail, and answering it. In the\nmorning I could be dealing with\ntransport, such as taking a minibus\nto a garage, or getting some\nstationery from Central Stores.\nLunch is taken at Norman's Union\nSnack Bar, and I don't normally\ndrink, in preparation for the\nafternoon.\nUnion committees such as\nFinance Committee tend to take\nplace in the early afternoon, finishing\nat 2 o 'clock, and College ones later\nthan that.\nEvenings can be taken up by Major\nSubCommittees. Monday's Publications Board went on until\n9.15, but most finish before then,\nexcept for the notorious U LUG UC which goes on late into the night.\nAfter this I do some social ising in the\nbar.\nThere are quite a few things that\nare a constant drain on my time, such\nas insurance, Gestetnering, or\nmaking phone calls. Menial jobs\nseem to take an inordinate amount of\ntime.\nAfter being President of R CSU last\nyear I felt that there was a lot of\nrational is ation that could be done in\nthe ICU, and that was one of the\nreasons I stood for Hon Sec.\nOn the whole I think people ought\nnot to underestimate the work\ninvolved, or the influence of the Hon\nSec. It's not an easy year spent in a quiet corner of the Union Office. I'm not sure what employers think of ex-Hon Sees. Few of the recent ones\nseem to have got good jobs on\nleaving college.\nIf I had known what the job\nentailed when I stood for it I wouldn't have been put off.\n6 Friday 8 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "PROFILE\nAnn Collins Ann Collins isn't exactly what most people\nexpect from a CCU president. For a start\nshe's female, doesn't play rugby and only\ndrinks halves when she takes part in boat\nraces. The major difference, though, is much\ndeeper. She is a very quiet, nervous person,\nnot the sort of person one would expect to\nfind running bar nights. Sitting nervously on\n'I 've done a lot of things\nthat I wouldn't have done\notherwise'\nCCU presidents are among the\nmost influential students at IC.\nFew students other than the\nhacks know much about them\nthough, so FELIX will be taking\na close look at each of them in\nturn over the next three weeks.\nthe edge of her bed in Southside Ann\nsummed it up when she said 'I 've done a lot of\nthings that I wouldn't have done otherwise'.\nAnn came to college from Stevenage,\nHertfordshire a bland, new town that is\nnotable for absolutely nothing. After a year\nas staircase rep, Ann became en vol ved in\nboth IC Union and RCS Union as Chemistry\ndepartmental representative.\n'The Union was a bit of a closed shop so I thought\nsome new blood would be a good idea'\nHowever it surprised the average RCS\n'hack' when she decided to run for president.\nIt was seen as an attempt broaden the appeal\nof the union. 'The Union was a bit of a closed\nshop so I thought some new blood would be a good idea', was the justification that\" Ann\nprovided for her decision to run.\nAnn won the election with a landslide\nmajority. Hacks said this was the result of\ntwo things. 'The Chemistry block vote',\nwhich is the group of non-hacks that are\nmean't to have provided the majority of her\nvoters, and the fact she is a women . Ann\ndenies that both these factors were\nimportant and points out that many people\nthink a CCU president needs to be a male so\nthat he can down his pints.\nThis year when Ann was elected, there\nwere worries that the Union would be split\nbetween hacks and non-hacks. An early\nBroadsheet, for example, criticised the\nChemistry block vote for dominating a UGM. However Ann claims this split hasn't The Raft Race: a personal highlight for Ann\noccured. 'I don't think we're a bunch of\nhappy hacks I don't think it has impaired the\nrunning of the union and it has provided\ndifferent facets for it'\nAnn admits that this year she hasn't instigated any great initiatives, to expand the\nunion's activities. What she thinks she has\ndone is increased the co-operation between\nthe CCUs. 'There is a lot of friendly rivalry\n(between unions) which is good but\nsometimes it is taken a bit far'. Ann also\nhopes that her year has started a trend\ntowards RCS becoming less 'hack'\norientated although she thinks it will be some\ntime until this trend is seen at all levels within\nthe union.\n'Considering I had no\nprevious experience, I think\nI did, in most cases the best I could'\nPersonally, Ann admits that she has made\nmistakes as president and as a result she\nsays isn't totally satisfied with her\nperformance. Union officers have criticised\nher being ineffective and naive on\ncommittees. However she thinks\n'considering I had no previous experience, I think I did in most cases the best I could and\nhindsight is a wonderful thing'.\nOverall Ann has enjoyed the year and\nthinks that it has been an opportunity she\n'would have been stupid to miss'. She has\nalso appreciated the opportunity to take part\nin events that otherwise she wouldn't normally have considered taking part in.\n'The raft race across the Serpentine nearly\nkilled me, but looking back I am glad that I did\nit'. One common belief among students is\nthat a period as CCU president damages\none's grades. Ann thinks in her case the main\nthing to suffer will be laboratory work. This\nmay result in her losing a grade of her degree.\nCCUs are, in Ann's view, essential to the\nsocial life of Imperial College because they\nadd to the character of Imperial College.\nThey also enable people to find some sense\nof belonging that may otherwise be lacking in\na college as large as IC.\n7 can't see it (RCS)\nchanging radically'\nAnn is less than certain about where RCS\nis going. 'I can't see it changing radically in\nthe next few years because there is too much\nresistance. They've got their traditions and\nthey cling to them'. Ann hopes that academic\naffairs will remain an important part of the\nUnion's role and that RCS clubs will become\nmore important.\nPersonally, Ann is aiming to go into trading\nwith oil companies and has already had\nseveral interviews. If she fails at this then she\nhopes to train as an accountant.\nFELIX Friday 8 February 1985 5\n\n"

A great deal of time has been spent on preparation for this visit( on February 6th) on a number of areas relevant to IC students.\nAreas of particular concern that will be discussed in detail with the UGC are accommodation problems, cost of living in London against the student grant and travel allowance, sports facilities on campus, overseas\nstudent problems, academic wastage rates and Central College Library Facilities. A written submission has been prepared on these subjects and sent to the members of the UGC. We hope to be able to cover many more in the discussions to follow. Will is Jackson & Evelyn Gardens Houses.\nFollowing the recent speculations of problems for Will is Jackson residents, I am pleased to be able to report the views and interests of the residents will be upper most when the detailed planning is carried out. Both the Warden and myself will be involved. On a larger scale, worries had been expressed that similar problems could\narise in the future in other houses. It has now been agreed that a rolling plan should be established such that similar type remedial work\nwill be carried out at the most convenient times i.e. during vacations and\nnot during term time. I hope that this point has been taken by those\nconcerned!\nCollege Refectory Refurbishment.\nProposals for this refurbishment are now becoming much firmer and. hone full v by the next UGM, I will be able to present plans to the UGM for approval\nby you.\nOne of the biggest changes is that it may be necessary to convert the present JCR into the main dining area, and use the current dining hall in S her field( i.e. on the ground floor) as the JCR.\nIn order that you can have a chance to express your views on this subject\nbefore the next UGM, there will be a meeting on Thursday 21st February at1.00 pm in the Union SCR. I would especially like to see the CCU and ICU\nEnts people there.\nElection of Officers. Towards the end of this term and during next term, the majority of the Union '\n(CCU and ICU) Officers for next year will be elected.

The Bookshop supports the CCU's to the tune of about 10%\nof their expenditure and ICU to \u00a32-3000 a year.\nIt has been noticed that shoplifting is occurring.

    "content": "EREVIEWS:\nTeachers\nRichard Mulligan plays an escaped lunatic teacher whom Nick\nNoble notices as having a special gift for instruction\nTeachers (Plaza)\nIt seems a pity that such a well researched film should be left to such a bland production and promotion. You will have\nseen it advertised as\nanother outrageous American comedy in the\nvein of Animal House or\nClass of 84. Of course not\nquite so hyped.\nI did not see this as a comedy but as a film with\nmore serious potential,\nwith that odd hint of\ndramatic comedy as used\nfar more successfully by\nShakespere or Pinter. This\nbland production is not of\nthat standard. The violence, drugs, sex, police\nand Teacher aspect is\ncorr rect but this production has managed to cram it\ninto another Soap Opera\nplot. Included is plenty of\nthat, so original dramatic\ncorn that infects so much\nmodern entertainment. As Alex (Nick Nolte\u2014in 48\nHours) a disillusioned\nidealist attempts to get\nthrough to a clich ed, rebel io us child, falls in love\nwith an ex-pupil\u2014now a lay wer involved in a school\nlaw case\u2014and command\nrespect from his pupils and\nfellow teachers.\nHow much more crowd\npull can you get? So a lunatic teacher is added\n(well over acted by Richard\nMulligan known from\nSoap). There is one good\nscene as a retarded boy is\nshot. The rebel io us child is\nplayed by Ralph Macchio\nwho has made a name for\nhimself in The Outsiders\nand other films, but is just\nanother child actor. The\nfilm reduces to Fame\nstandards as 'the kids' file\ninto the teacher's classroom to stop him resign-ing. A happy ending follows with the last\ndramatic words 'I'm a Teacher', followed by\nsome dramatic MOR rock\nmusic.\nLuke Boucher\nSINGLES\n45 *\nEnglish Evenings: / Will\nReturn\nEnglish evenings have\nbeen described as a funky\nAlarm and certainly this\nlatest single has some of\nthe angry excitement say\nof 68 Guns but with funky\nproduction more reminiscent of the Buggies! Not\ntheir best single, but OK.\nImmaculate Fools: Immaculate Fools\nDon't know if your\nremember the Bowie\nsingle a few years back, but\nI think the lead singer here\nmust have been well\nimpressed by it. This\neponymous ly titled song\nretains a distinctly folk y background feel (even\nincluding Pan Pipes!) and\ntogether with the album,\nHearts of Fortune could\nherald a great deal from the\nband.\nJeffery Osborne: The\nBorderlines\nThese reviews have been\nsaid to be adjective ly verbally overly de scrip it ive but sometimes it's difficult\nto say anything interesting\nabout a disc without being\npretentious. OK, so I could\nsay that borderlines is\nSoulful Funk and is quite\ngood; but does that mean\nany more to anyone than\ncommenting that Osborne\nhas at last escaped the\nconfines of the syrup sweet\nimage-packing of A and M hype with this dangerously\nexciting seven inches of\nelectro soul? I'm not sure.\nValentines Day Febuary 14th999 kHz9 ll pm SEND YOUR V.D.

    "content": "OPINIONJ\nSabbatical\ncredibility\nFinal year student Graham Thorpe, ICU Academic Affairs Officer, recounts his\nexperiences at a ULU mini-conference on education. .\nLast Saturday saw the first ever 'Education\nDay' held for London Colleges. It was jointly\norganised by ULU and LSO (London\nStudent Organisation \u2014 the London branch\nof the NUS). Aimed at not only present\nofficers, but potential Union post holders,\nthe basic idea of the day was to stimulate\ndiscussion about aspects of academic affairs.\nNext Tuesday, papers for the post of\nDepartmental Representative will be coming\ndown. Some departments will have a number\nof interested students, whereas in others the\npapers will have to stay up until someone\nputs their name up. But will candidates will\nhave a clue as to how much power they will\nhold in their hands when elected.\nULU/LSO's one day mini-conference on\nacademic affairs was a day of learning for all\nthose involved. Neither the six delegates\nfrom Imperial who attended, nor other\ndelegates, nor even the organizers knew\nreally what to expect. The day got off to a slow start (the water wasn't hot enough for\ncoffee). Phil Woolas\u2014NUS President was\ndue to open proceedings but was unable to\nattend. Instead, Delyth Morgan (ULU\nPresident) and Peter Carr (LSO convenor)\ngave a brief introduction before the 30-40\npeople present broke down into three\ngroups for discussion workshops on\neducation cuts, education policy and\nwelfare.\nEach session was run twice, thus giving\ndelegates the chance to attend two.\nNaturally the start of each group was shaky,\nbut by the end of the second period, people\nhad forgotten any shyness and discussions\nwere running well.\nAfter a short 'de-brief (mainly to reassure\nMs Morgan that events were running\nsmoothly) it was down to the re-named\nMergers bar, to talk over first impressions of\nthe usefulness of the day over lunch.\nDespite obvious dislike of Imperial's non-membership of NUS, there were s uprising ly few of the petty intercollegiate wrangling s of\nGUC (ULU Council) and nearly all political\ndifferences were left well alone.\nInstead those two preliminary sessions\nhad thrown up a range of ideas, and a few\neye-opening facts.\nWhat would students at Imperial do if\nStaff/Student committees failed to exist?\nCould you imagine a complaints system\nwithout a Dep Rep? Surprisingly some\ncolleges do not have what we take for\ngranted at Imperial. But this does not mean\nthat we can be complacent\u2014not at all.\nDespite having a very good infrastructure for\nstudent representation the debates focussed\nhow much more use could be made of the\nfacilities. Why, for instance do so few\nstudents attend IC UGM's? The Dep Rep's position is seen differently by people who are\ninvolved to differing degrees in the Union. To\nmany students a Dep Rep can be viewed as a one way channel for complaints about the\ncourse. Indeed this is an important area of\nthe reps work, although criticism is all too\noften not constructive enough to be of any\nuse. However a Dep Rep also sits on Union\nCouncil. So what? Council is the ruling body\nof the Union, responsible for many of its\npolices. So although the Dep Rep may not\nrealise this, they are there to represent all the\nstudents in their departments. This is where\nthe present system breaks down. In order to\nensure a more democratic Union, with\ngreater student involvement, Dep Reps must\nbecome more interactive. It is their duty to\nreport back to their department's students\nexactly what occurs at Council, policy\ndecided and possible implications. Whilst it\nmay be argued that FELIX does this to an\nextent, there can be no substitute for\npersonal contact, and the intrinsic questions\nand answers this involves. College does not\nexpect us to learn from just print on a page.\nShould the Union? Five minutes a week at\nthe end of one lecture would make a lot of\ndifference to people's understanding of\ncertain issues.\nSo with these thoughts ringing in my ears,\nit was time for the afternoon session. After a 'brain storming' period to discover what\npeople considered to be the issues in\nacademic affairs, lack of communication, the\neffect of cuts, and others, there was a discussion of what tools were available to\nwork for change. This included an interesting\ndiscussion on how to conduct yourself when\non a college committee, as well as producing\nmore ideas\u2014this time about the continuity of\nacademic affairs.\nFinancially clubs and societies have five\nyear plans laid out, so that they can achieve a level of equipment attainment.\nCorrespondingly, student unions should set\nthemselves goals, not just in the short term,\nbut in a longer term as well. This has wider\nimplications than just for academic affairs.\nFollowing yet another coffee break it was\ndown to more workshops, this time covering\nmore specific problems Libraries, Mergers,\nWomen. Again each was run twice.\nAt the end of these, with heads (or\nnotepad s) full of ideas it was time for the final\n'debriefing' session, before the eagerly\nawaited wine. Despite more jibes about the\nNUS, the general feeling was that the day\nhad been worthwhile for most people,\nalthough not possibly in a very quantifiable\nmanner. Such a day is proposed for next\nyear, but it was pointed out that ULU's faculty boards could (or should) be doing\nmore in this line, (there are faculty boards for\nScience and Engineering, Medicine,\nHumanities, Arts etc).\nAnd so, once the wine had removed any\nremaining inhibitions, it was time to talk to\nMs Morgen and dream of a non-political\nNUS, led by Imperial students, huge grants\nfor all, and endless accommodation...\nA thought for the day: Academic affairs is\nnot a soft option.\nFELIX Friday 8 February 1985 7\n\n"
