This was clearly matched\nby the anticipation of others,\ngiven that it was nominated\nfor the Teen Choice Award\n\u2018Choice AnTEENcipated\nMovie\u2019 (groan). Before the\nfilm is even released, there\nwas merchandise in every\nshop and children already\nown the full set of Troll dolls.\nBut all this build up made the\ndisappointment of the actual\nfilm that much more bitter.\nThings started well enough.\nA surprisingly dark introduction explains how the\nsong-filled, forever cheery\nTrolls are held captive and\nannually massacred on\n\u2018Trollstice\u2019 by the miserable\nBurgens. The Trolls are eaten\nbecause this is the only way\nthe Burgens can experience\ntrue happiness. However,\non the eve of Prince Gristle\u2019s\n(Christopher Mintz-Platz) first\nTrollstice, the Trolls carried\nout their escape, led by\nJeffrey Tambor\u2019s King Peppy\nwith the rallying cry of \u2018no\ntroll left behind\u2019. We then cut\nto twenty years later, where\nthe trolls have already\nforgotten the threat of the Burgens due to their ceaselessly\njoyous (read: perpetually irri-tating) nature and decide to\nthrow a loud celebration. Of\ncourse, they\u2019re found and\ntrollnapped, leading our\nheroine Princess Poppy\n(Anna Kendrick) and grey,\nsongless Branch (Justin Timberlake) to rescue them and\nsave the day. Cue the usual\nrescue-mission dangers, eventual fuzzy-feelings between\nthe\ntwo leads, and eye-rolling\nplot points, topped off by\nnon-existent. It was horribly\nclear that many of the headlining cast had gone to the\nstudio for the day, recorded\ntheir few lines and collected\ntheir paycheck, thank you\nvery much (I\u2019m looking at you\nJames Corden and Russell\nBrand). Their characters were\ndifficult to care about and\ndid not inspire compassion\nor empathy \u2013 key values off\nwhich children\u2019s film are so\noften based. I did not think\nthey were cute or funny,\nnor did they put a smile on\nmy face. My most profound\nsurge of sympathy was\ndirected toward the crying\nchild who could be heard\nthroughout the cinema when\nhe just couldn\u2019t take anymore.\nI would\u2019ve been quite pleased\nif they\u2019d all be eaten by\nthe Bergens \u2013 at least then\nthere\u2019d be no chance of a\nsequel..\nThe film is sold as the \u2018most\nsmart, funny, irreverent animated comedy of the year\u2019.\nThis is the publicity team\u2019s\nown version of \u2018trolling\u2019.\nSimply put, the writing was\nfrustrating and the storyline\nwas old, tired and lazy.\nAttempts to avoid this, such\nas the slightly-too-subtle\nreferences to classics such\nas Labyrinth, were lost in the\nmalaise of cringe; in the same\nscene, we met a cloud whose\nentire dialogue consisted of\nDad jokes about high fives.\nThere was so much potential\nhere. But once the character \u2018Guy Diamond\u2019 (Kunal\nNayyar) had farted glitter in\nsomeone\u2019s face for the third\ntime, even the youngest in\nthe audience couldn\u2019t keep\nlaughing. Use of the (sadly\nendemic) phrase YOLO was\na depressing nadir of the film.\nAs the credits rolled, and we\ntried to escape, I had to wake\nup a Dad who was not only\nasleep himself, but had his\ntwo sleeping boys on top\nof him. I sincerely doubt\nthis was the effect the\nstudio was going for. The\ntagline reads \u2018Find your\nhappy place\u2019 \u2013 yours will\nbe as far away from this film\nas you can get.\nJenny Shelley\nThe latest animation from\nDreamworks shows that the\nstudio has hit a new low,\nproducing an annoyingly\nterrible piece of work, with\nessentialy no redeeming features\n\\\\ All the build up to\nTrolls only made the\ndisappointment of\nthe actual film that\nmuch more bitter \\\\\nbludgeoning the audience\nrepeatedly with the films\nmessage that \u2018everyone has\nhappiness inside\u2019.\nMeanwhile, the romantic subplot between\nscullery maid Bridget (Zooey\nDeschanel) and Prince Gristle\ninitially invokes some sym-pathy, tapping into universal\nfeelings of impossible love\nand unreturned attraction.\nHowever, the connection was\nshort-lived when they turned\nit into a contrived Cinderella.\nBranch is supposed to be the\nsarcastic, relatable, sob-story\nco-star. His trauma derives\nfrom killing his own Grandma\nwith his singing \u2013 mine will\nforever be derived from\nviewing this film. The brief\npositive was the soundtrack.\nThe use of well-known songs\nwas enjoyable and creative,\nbringing in a variety of hits\nat clever moments, such as\nGorillaz\u2019s Clint Eastwood\nand Lional Richie\u2019s Hello.\nThe music department did an\nexcellent job. Unfortunately,\nthe rest of the team did not.\nIf the cast had any input at\nall, it could not be felt. Having\nwell-known comedians on\nhand left no mark as jokes fell\nflat and comedy timing was\nEven the cast of Trolls aren\u2019t too impressed with\nthe film \\\\ DREAMWORKS ANIMATION\n\\\\ The eye-rolling\nplot points are\ntopped off by bludgeoning the audience\nrepeatedly with the\nfilm\u2019s message that\n\u2018everyone has happiness inside \\\\\nTrolls: as annoying as they are creepy\n\\\\ DREAMWORKS ANIMATION\nTrollish\nby name,\ntrollish\nby nature\n\n"

Now, of course\nit\u2019s great to have characters\nmake grandiose statements\nabout their race and place in\nthe world, but sometimes it\u2019s\nnice to have someone who\u2019s\nlike you just there: no fuss,\nno fanfare.

Taking\nplace in the city where Glover\nD\nonald Glover:\ncreator, writer\nand star of\nAtlanta is a guy\nI don\u2019t think that\ncan be classed as\nanything other than a genius.\nHaving such an expansive\ncareer as a writer, stand-up,\nactor and rapper at such a\nyoung age isn\u2019t something\nthat most could manage.\nNeither could most create\nsuch a great show as Atlanta.\nThe most adequate way I\ncan describe it would be as a\nhimself grew up, the show\nprimarily follows Glover\u2019s\nEarn Marks, a man struggling\nto keep his head above water\nfinancially who gets a small\nlucky break when he finds\nthat his cousin, Paper Boi, has\nreleased a locally popular\nmixtape. The two, along with\ntheir friend Darius, seek to\nkeep the fame train rolling.\nDespite this premise, you\nnever feel like this is really\nin grasp for the characters,\nbut you hope with them all\nthe same. Though the show\nsticks with a half-hour comedy\nformat, it really excels in\nstraddling the line between\ndrama and comewdy, never\nquite coming down on either\nside in any given scene. This\nis shown most expertly in a\nscene in episode 2 dealing\nwith a mentally ill man in\njail. This scene is a great\nexample of the way the show\nportrays dealing with the\nexperience of Black America.\nWhile never forcing it down\nyour throat, the constant\nawareness and understanding\nof the characters\u2019 poverty\n\u2018black show\u2019 with an all-black\nwriting staff makes it timely\nas well with the heightened\nracial tension across the states\nat the moment. While it hasn\u2019t\nyet finished its first season,\nI certainly feel comfortable\ncalling this one of the best\nshows of the year. It really is\na testament to Donald Glover\nto have another such wildly\nsuccessful project under his\nbelt. The one thing I don\u2019t\nlike about this show is that it\nmeans Donald will have less\ntime to devote to his music.\nand the structural racism they\nexperience aids greatly in\nsympathising and loving the\ncharacters. Its status as a\nAtlanta shows us an experience of\nBlack America \\\\ FX\nAtlanta\nHarry Wilkinson\nTearing down\nTV\u2019s ghettos\nAziz Ansari and co in Master of None \\\\ Netflix\nA\ns Master\nof None\nexplained late\nlast year, time\nwas when if\nyou had more\nthan one black person in a\nshow, it would be written off\nas a \u2018black show\u2019. In fact, time\nstill is that having more than\none Asian person in a piece\nresults in it being known as\nan \u2018Asian show\u2019.\nHowever, with the increasing\ndemocratisation of TV,\nand the general on going\nstreaming service paradigm\nshift, this is slowly beginning\nto change. Shows like\nAtlanta, Luke Cage, Master\nof None, Citizen Khan and\nFresh off the boat have\npenetrated the mainstream,\nconsistently pulling in high\nviewship numbers and critical\nreceptions. Alongside the\ngrowing volume of people of\ncolour in our visual media,\nthe variety of characters has\nalso blossomed. Obviously,\nwe\u2019ve started slowly drifting\naway from stereotypes, but in\ndistinct feeling of belonging\nand a triumphant assurance\nthat this is the way it should\nbe. Unrestricted inclusion\nalso generates better and\nfresher content through the\nconveyance of a range of\nexperiences. The spread\nof narratives that wouldn\u2019t\ntraditionally have recieved\nwide exposure or new takes\non existing stories and that\nmight better engage people is\nonly good for entertainment.\nA curious counter-argument\nsurfaces to this.

But I\nrespectfully disagree \u2014 the\ninformation shared through\nhis subjects is an integral\npart of being a competent\nreporter.\nDespite all these complex\nnarratives, Herzog retains\nan ability to chronologically\nspan through the Internet\u2019s\nhistory, from its 1969 conception at the University of\nCalifornia to what it will mean\nin the future. This could easily\nhave been a hindrance to the\nmovie\u2019s pacing, but instead,\nit advances the narrative\nand allows viewers to better\nunderstand the Internet\u2019s\nimpact through different eras.\nAttempting to examine the\nreach of the online world\nis a daunting task. Herzog,\nhowever, tackles the subject\nwith relative ease, informing and actively engaging\nhis audience through a\nstimulating mental journey.\nAlong the way, he\u2019s assisted\nby the expertise of several\npeople whose lives have been\ndramatically impacted by the\nInternet\u2019s presence. Thanks to\nall of them, once the credits\nstart, we have a much richer\nunderstanding of its impact in\nour lives.\nT\nhe Internet. It was\ninvented in 1969,\nand has objectively\nbecome a part\nof society\u2019s daily\nconsciousness. And\nyet, director Werner Herzog\nreminds us that it is much\nmore powerful than we could\nhave even imagined.\nIn Lo And Behold: Reveries\nof the Connected World,\nHerzog masterfully pieces\ntogether a 94-minute documentary that details how\nexactly the online world has\npermeated our lives, from the\nevolution of self-driving cars\nto cyber security becoming a\npriority among governments.\nThis film\u2019s excellence lies\nin the simplicity of Herzog\u2019s\nstyle: much of the film is\ninterview footage ranging\nfrom expert hacker Kevin\nMitnick to famous entrepreneur Elon Musk. There is the\noccasional b-roll and diagram\nto break up the face-to-face\ninteraction, but what we see is\nmostly authentic footage and\nraw uncut film that usually\nloses the audience\u2019s interest,\nbut not here. The subject\nmatter is just too interesting\nwhen we look at it through\nHerzog\u2019s eyes.\nAnd perhaps one of the\nveteran director\u2019s most\nthought-provoking views\ncame in an answer to an\naudience question before the\nfree screening at the Curzon\nSoho on the 14th\nof October:\n\u201cDocumentaries should not\njust be facts \u2026 facts do not\nalways constitute truth.\u201d\nThis idea applies throughout\nthe film, but one particular\nexample that jumps to mind is\nwhere Herzog interviews the\nfamily of Nikki Catsouras, an\n18-year-old who died in 2006\nin a car crash in California.\nThe family, who saw\nhorrible pictures of Nikki\ndisfigured online, denounce\nthe Internet as an \u201cevil\u201d\nforce. Lesli, Nikki\u2019s mother,\neven goes as far to say that\nthose who are connected\nonline have demonic spirits\nin them \u2014 a statement that\nis hard to believe, but also\nhard to argue against. This,\nhowever, effectively illustrates\nthe non-factual element of\ndocumentaries that Herzog\nappears to value.\nIt is this attention to detail\nthat makes the story more\neffective \u2014 even for a 21-year-old who clearly knows what\nthe Internet is and its ability to\nconnect others. The raw emotion in the Catsouras scene\nforces us to step back and\nrealize its negative impact.\nHerzog says in the press\nrelease for Lo and Behold\nBy Steve Bohnel\nLo and Behold:\nReveries of the\nConnected World\nWerner Herzog takes us on a journey through\nthe internet \\\\ DOGWOOF\nDOCUMENTARY OF THE WEEK\nThree french films that aren\u2019t Am\u00e9lie\nDelicatessen Les Emotifs\nAnynonymes\n(Romantics\nAnonymous)\nLe Rayon Vert\n(The Green Ray)\nE\nveryone who\u2019s\ncool has seen\nAm\u00e9lie, it\u2019s one of\nfew French films\nthat has enjoyed\nsuccess outside of\nFrance. Starring the adorable\nAudrey Tautou, this richly\ncoloured film with an equally\nmesmerising soundtrack filled\nwith quirky characters doing\nquirky things in the quest for\nlove, is (in)famous for being\nsaturated with sweetness. But\nthere\u2019s more to France than\ncute Audrey and nostalgic\ntinted cinematography. So\nhere are some other films\nfrom France that are as\ndelightful to watch as Am\u00e9lie.\nThe similarities between\nthis film and Am\u00e9lie are so\nobvious that it should come\nas no surprise that they share\nthe same director, JeanPierre Jeunet. The tone of the\nfilm, although with a much\ndarker topic, shares the same\nhumour, quirky dialogue\nand cinematography that\nis abundant in Am\u00e9lie. A\nno-brainer for anyone who\nenjoyed Am\u00e9lie.\nRomantic comedy done\nright. This film is about a\nbudding romance between\ntwo very socially awkward\npeople. Set in a chocolate\nfactory, there\u2019s enough\n\u2018sweetness\u2019 to go around.\nDirected by the one of\nthe men involved with the\ncreation of the French New\nWave cinema, Eric Rohmer,\nLe Rayon Vert is not expected\nto disappoint. And it doesn\u2019t.\nA gentle film about an aimless\nwoman recovering from a\nbreak-up; it follows her during\nher vacation and highlights\nher growing boredom and\nfrustration at being expected\nto play the role of the single\nwoman.

This thrilling and gripping tale of deceit, betrayal,\nextra-marital affairs, and\nmadness culminates in a chilling ending, which I guarantee\nwill not disappoint.\nOne of the most interesting things about the play\nitself is the way four black\nscreens from all sides of the\nstage create a sort of square\npinhole effect between scene\nchanges, focusing on certain\ncharacters almost like a lens.\nThe screens also frame rooms\nof differing dimensions, creating a small black box around\ncramped low-ceilinged rooms\nand widening again when,\nfor example, we\u2019re shown\nMona\u2019s spacious Manhattan apartment. As you\u2019d\nexpect from the National\nTheatre, the set is extremely\nwell designed and the black\nframing made it feel almost\nlike a cinema screening. Even\nin scene changes, telephone\ncalls booming from the speakers enable the narrative to\ncontinue moving without the\nactors in sight.\nOn the whole, this play was\na continuous 110 minutes\nof top-notch acting and a\ngripping plot.

Despite his\nreputation as a lyricist, it was\nthe sound, not the content\nof his songs, that I first fell in\nlove with. Positively 4th\nStreet,\na single never to appear on\nan LP, stands out amongst my\nearly Dylan listening. With a\nplodding piano melody and\nAl Kooper\u2019s unmistakeable\norgan playing leading into\nhis voice, it sums up the sound\nthat Dylan was recording in\n1965. It was a sound that\nmarked the end of Bob the\nfolk singer and the start of\nDylan the rock star, a sound\nso beautiful that as a 7-year-old you don\u2019t fully appreciate\nthat the song is a rather\nvicious attack on a former\nfriend. In a similar way to Like\na Rolling Stone, there\u2019s an\nimmense amount of anger in\nhis words, but not his voice;\nfor Dylan, the subject matter\ndoes not stand in the way of\na great song. Once you start\nto listen to the lyrics, though,\nmy god do the songs take on\na new life.\nI did so, inadvertently, while\ndoing homework on a winter\nnight in my early teens. I\ndecided to put on the album\nBringing It All Back Home;\nI did this a lot, but normally\ndidn\u2019t get past the first three\ntracks: Subterranean Home\nSick Blues, She Belongs to\nMe, and Maggie\u2019s Farm. I\nloved these songs so much\nby this point that I would\nalways skip back to the start\nof the album once the third\nhad ended so I could hear\nthem all again. I guess I\nwas distracted by my work\nand so forgot to do so that\nparticular evening. The\nalbum ran. By the time the\npenultimate track came on\nI\u2019d finished the homework\nand started to listen to each\nand every word. It\u2019s Alright,\nMa (I\u2019m Only Bleeding) is, to\nthis day, perhaps the single\ngreatest example of song\nwriting I\u2019ve had the pleasure\nlast week. Right she is, but not\nonly that: he performed those\nexpressions. Pre-Dylan (and\npre-Beatles), the idea that a\nchart topping musician would\nsing their own songs was\nunthinkable. Hits were written\nin office blocks by men in\nsuits and handed to the likes\nof Elvis Presley for recording.\nIt is fitting then, that Dylan,\nwith 37 studio albums to his\nname and having reinvented\nhimself constantly over the\nlast 54 years (from acoustic to\nelectric and back to acoustic,\nfrom rock to country, from a\nsecular voice to that of a man\nwho has just found Jesus),\nbecomes the first musician to\nwin the prize in its 115-year\nhistory. Much has been said\nover the past week as to\nwhether the award should\nbe presented a singer at all.\nBobDylanfirstmusiciantowinNobelPrize\n\\\\ Dylan\u2019s songs\nare as great a\nwork of literature\nas a collection of\nnovels, as much poetry to read as they\nare songs to listen\nto \\\\\nof encountering. No backing\nband this time, just the folk\nsinger, accompanied by a\nharmonica and an eerily quiet\nguitar, whose simple chord\nprogression changes little\nover the song\u2019s seven and a\nhalf minute run time. I listened\nto those seven and a half\nminutes on loop for the rest\nof the evening and I\u2019ve been\nlistening to them regularly\never since. Each and every\nline written and sung by the\nthen 24-year-old stands out.\n\u201cDarkness at the break of\nnoon\u201d, \u201cAdvertising signs that\ncon you into thinking you\u2019re\nthe one, that can do what\u2019s\nnever been done\u201d, \u201cFor them\nthat must obey authority\u2026...\nDo what they do just to be\nnothing more than something they invest in\u201d, \u201cMoney\ndoesn\u2019t talk, it swears\u201d; most\nlyricists would be prepping a\nGrammy acceptance speech\nfor having penned just one.\nBob Dylan wrote 15 verses of\nthem (oh, and choruses). Bob\nDylan isn\u2019t most musicians,\nhe\u2019s a Nobel Laureate.\n\u201cFor having created new\npoetic expressions, within\nthe great American song\ntradition\u201d read Prof. Sara\nDanius, Permanent Secretary\nof the Swedish Academy, on\nthe announcement of Dylan\u2019s\nNobel Prize in Literature win\nTarantula, a prose poetry\nbook and the first volume of\nhis autobiography, are all\nDylan has written in terms\nof original literature. On top\nof that his music has been\ncritically acknowledged his\nentire career (13 Grammy\nwins and an Academy Award\nto name but a few), so is there\nany need to be lavishing\nhim with a prize intended\nfor those who occupy the\nworld of written expression\nonly? Others, however,\nhave argued that his lyrics\nthemselves, published several\ntimes, are as great a work of\nliterature as any author\u2019s collection of novels and that they\nare as much poetry to read\nas they are songs to listen\nto. Dylan has not yet spoken\npublically about his Nobel\nPrize, despite playing a gig in\nLas Vegas hours after it was\nannounced. A quote from\nthe man himself, given during\na press conference in San\nFrancisco in December 1965,\nin response to whether his\nmusic or his lyrics are more\nimportant, is perhaps the best\nargument one could give for\nthe greatest songwriter of the\n20th\nCentury winning writing\u2019s\nmost coveted award: \u201cThe\nwords are just as important\nas the music.

In\n1999, The Holy Virgin Mary,\na black Madonna with her\none exposed breast made out\nof lacquered elephantdung,\ncaused something of a media\nfirestorm in New York, so\nmuch so that it caused then\nMayor Rudy Guiliani to cut\nfunding for the Brooklyn\nMuseum, where the work was\ndisplayed.\nNo stranger to controversy,\nOfili has made a career of\ncreating visually arresting,\nlarger than life works that\npush boundaries even without\nelephant dung. His paintings in the past have been\nintricate creations, bold and\ncolourful, filled with vibrant\nyellows and scarlets, and\nflecked with glitter. Ofili\u2019s\nwork deals in large part with\nthe black experience. He\nis of Nigerian descent and\ngrew up in Manchester. He\ncame to study in London,\nfirst at the Chelsea School\nof Art and then the Royal\nCollege of Art, and he has\nsince moved to Port of Spain,\nTrinidad. In some of his most\nmoving paintings he has dealt\nwith the subject of race and\nidentity head on. The 1996\npainting, Afrodizzia, features\ntiny cut outs of black cultural\nicons. Diana Ross, Cassius\nClay, Martin Luther King Jr,\nTupac Shakur, among many\nothers appear with identical\nhand painted afros against\na riot of colour. It is a celebration of black identity, not\nonly of the individuals who\nsucceeded in their respective\nfields during the Civil Rights\nmovements. Ofili describes\nthe use of celebrity in this\npainting as a shorthand for\nbrotherhood; the faces are\nrecognizable close up, but\ntheir identical Afro hairstyles\nare meant to amalgamate\nthem into a collective. \u201cIt\u2019s\nLawrence inquiry would\nlater find two of the men\nguilty, and in 2011, they were\nsentenced. The inquiry found\nevidence of systemic and\ninstitutionalised racism at the\nMetropolitan police during\nthe 90s.\nAfter a period of relative\nabsence from the art world\nfrom 2010, Ofili returned with\nBlue Devils, painted in 2014.\nIn Blue Devils, gone is the\nelephant dung, gone are the\nbright hues and dots; this is a\npared down Ofili.\nThe vast, almost three-metre\nhigh canvas is entirely blue\nas nebulous shapes painted\nin slightly different shades of\nblue and black emerge and\ndissolve. It was inspired by\nthe performers who cover\nthemselves in blue pigment\nand descend on the annual\nCarnival in Paramin, Trinidad,\npitchforks in hand. This\ndisquieting otherness and\nChris Ofili | More than elephant dung\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ Ofili\u2019s painting is\nexuberant, joyful,\nmixing together\ninfluences from jazz\nto hip hop to\ncelebrity \\\\\nnot about identifying faces,\nit\u2019s about dissolving faces.\u201d\nhe has said of the work. The\nbackground is a pulsing array\nof colourful dots, inspired by\nthe formative Zimbabwe trip,\nwhere Ofili encountered tribal\npaintings in caves which he\nsays reminds him of \u2018rhythm\nof chants and drumbeats\u2019.\nIt is this exuberant, joyful\nway of painting, mixing\ntogether influences from jazz\nto hip hop to celebrity that\nhas characterized Ofili\u2019s work\nthrough the decades. However, even in its irreverence\nand surface level frivolity, his\nwork has bite.\nOfili won the Turner Prize in\n1998, the first black artist to\ndo so (he remains to this day\none of two: Steve McQueen\nwon the following year). One\nof the works submitted as part\nof portofolio was No Woman,\nNo Cry. Named after the Bob\nMarley song, the canvas is\nof a black woman, inspired\nby Doreen Lawrence, crying.\nHuge white tears fall down\nthe length of the canvas, and\ninside each tear is the face\nof Stephen Lawrence, who\nwas stabbed to death in 1993\nin South London in a vicious\nracist attack. The painting\nreflected the grief and\nfrustration that the Lawrence\nfamily, and the wider black\ncommunity, felt at the fact that\nmen who had committed the\nmurder had been arrested but\nnever convicted. The Stephen\nviolence of course carries a\ndual meaning. \u2018Blue\u2019 in this\ncase could just as easily refer\nto \u2018the boys in blue\u2019, police\nofficers, both in America and\nthe UK.\nBlack men face discrimination at the hands of police\nin both countries. This has\nbeen most stark in America\nin light of the police brutality\nand many killings of black\nmen that has sparked the\nBlack Lives Matter movement.\nIn Britain, with the merciful\nlack of firearms, the violence\nis less overt and yet the\ndiscrimination no less potent.\nThe Guardian reported last\nyear that black people were\nwere up to 17.5 times more\nlikely than white people to\nbe stopped and searched by\nthe police in some parts of\nthe UK. This disparity in stop\nand searches (the majority of which do not end in\narrest) show what absolute\npower the police can have\nto inconvenience at best,\nhumiliate and hurt at worst.\nBlue Devils with its undercurrent of menace, portrays this\neloquently.\nIn January next year, Tate\nBritain will be holding a\nretrospective of Ofili\u2019s work,\nbringing together his earliest\nwork with his more recent\noutput. There could not be a\nmore timely return to Ofili\u2019s\npaintings.\n\\\\ Irreverent, intri-cate, and colourful,\nOfili\u2019s work has a lot\nof political bite, even\nwhen covered in\nglitter and elephant\ndung \\\\\nNo Woman, No Cry by Chris Ofili \\\\ Tate\n\n"

In the original,\nproducer Mizuguchi realised\na vision of a computer\n\u201csupernetwork\u201d navigated\nby an on-screen avatar that\nwould now be called \u2018retro\u2019.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the gameplay or\ngraphics that set Rez apart.\nIt was a rhythm game that\ndidn\u2019t require players to think\nabout rhythm, an on-rails\nshooter set to electronic music\nenhanced by the player\u2019s\nactions.\nToday, even without experiencing the VR mode of the\ngame, the improved visual\nfidelity and sound make Rez\nInfinite feel like a game that\nhas barely aged. Its simple\nrail shooter mechanics (a\ngenre which barely exists in\n2016) are a welcome relief\nfrom the complex controls\nof popular rhythm games or\nthird-person shooters.\nRez captures perfectly the\nclassic vision of what being\ninside a computer might\ngaming over the last decade\nbut with VR it looks like it\nmight see a revival.\nIn Rez the player\u2019s avatar\nfloats throughout each\nlevel, like the snowman from\nRaymond Briggs\u2019 cherished\nchildren\u2019s picture book. Unlike\nother shoot \u2018em ups, Mizuguchi\u2019s masterpiece does not\nrequire players to furiously\npress the triggers of their\nDualshock controller. Rez\nuses a lock-on system, where\nholding down the \u2018X\u2019 button\nand hovering over enemies\nsets them as a target. Release\n\u2018X\u2019 and the game automatically fires missiles and ammo\nat each target in rhythm with\nthe game\u2019s soundtrack. This\ngives players the freedom\nto play in different ways;\nthey can try and select every\ntarget on the screen at the\nsame time or go for small\nclusters on opponents in quick\nsuccession. These different\napproaches are unlikely to\nchange a player\u2019s success but\ncan have a large effect on the\nmusic.\nAt times, the music of Rez\nalmost becomes background\nmusic, not because it\u2019s uninteresting but because it becomes\npart of the players decision\nmaking, subtly controlling\ntheir in-game actions. The\nvibrations of your controller\nact as a sixth-sense, a thumping rhythm that never lets up.\nDefeating different enemies\nmakes different sounds that\ndissolve perfectly in the\nendless beating of the background track. Scatter your\nbe like \u2013 a landscape built\nfrom 3D meshes, hexagons,\nfloating cubes and circuit\nboard-like textures.\nAnti-aliasing smooths\nout all the lines, giving the\ngame a more modern feel,\n\\\\ The improved\nvisual fidelity and\nsound make Rez\nInfinite feel like\na game that has\nbarely aged \\\\\nFloating in a sea of Low Rez textures \\\\ Enhance Games\nRez Infinite by Enhance\nGames is out now on PS4\nand PS VR\nwhile low-res textures add\nto the 80s inspired aesthetic.\nThe many floating objects,\nswirling monsters and floating\nbattleships are quite unlike\nanything in gaming today.\nYet surprisingly, this vision of\na cyber-dystopia looks back\nin time more than it does\nforward: at the beginning\nof each boss encounter the\nplayer hurls towards and\nthrough a massive digital\nmonument. From pyramids\nto greek temples, these\nstructures house inside them\ngod-like creatures that the\nplayer must defeat. The forms\nof these creatures are constantly in flux, often coming\nin multiple stages, and they\u2019re\nfar more challenging than the\nlevels that precede them.\nSimplicity is where Rez\nsucceeds the most.

This is\ngreat news for HIV sufferers\nthat have to undergo frequent\nand intense drug therapy to\nkeep HIV at bay.\nGlobally, 36 million people\nsuffer from HIV, and there is\nno permanent cure for the dis-ease. Currently, antiretroviral\ndrugs are used, which target\nthe virus to slow its replication.\nAntiretroviral drug therapy\n(ART) means that HIV patients\nare able to live with the virus,\navoiding the death sentence.\nUsually, regular and intense\nlevels of drugs are needed to\nslow viral charge build up. This\ncan have bad side effects, such\nas poisoning, inflammation and\naccelerated aging. Given that\nART is the most effective treatment at the moment, reducing\npatient suffering is a priority.\nThis study brings hope that\none day, such rigorous drug\ntreatment will not be needed.\nThe key to success appears to\nhave been the result of using\ncombination therapy: both\nantiretroviral drugs and an\nantibody. The monkeys were\ntreated with antiretroviral drugs\nfor nine weeks, and an antibody was also given after week\nnine until the end of the treat-ment. An antibody is a protein\nused by the immune system to\ntarget harmful viruses and bac-teria. The antibody given was\na variant of Vedolizumab, a\ntherapeutic antibody used in\nthe treatment of inflammatory\nbowel diseases. It targeted\nanother protein used by SIV,\nand HIV, to enter cells. This\nstopped further spread of the\nvirus, as viruses depend on\nusing other cells as hosts to\nreplicate and spread.\nAfter stopping both treat-ments, the viral load was\nundetectable for nine months,\nand was still low two years\nlater. The success of the therapy paves the way for better\ntreatment in humans, and a\nclinical trial is already underway in the US. The goal is to\nsee whether this combination\ntreatment, using antiretroviral\ndrugs with the antibody, can\nhave the same long-term effect\nin humans. The researchers\ninvolved are confident that the\nresults will be life-changing for\nHIV sufferers.\nHowmuchwateristoomuchwater?\nT\nhe mantra that\ndrinking lots of\nwater is good for\nus is a familiar one\nand indeed, the\nNHS recommends\ndrinking 8 glasses a day.\nHowever, a new study has\nchallenged this popular idea.\nFor the first time, scientists\nhave gained an insight into\nthe mechanism that regulates\nfluid intake and stops us\nfrom drinking too much. This\nresearch suggests that we\nshould listen to our bodies and\ndrink according to thirst rather\nthan sticking to a rigid routine.\nIn fact, over-drinking can even\nbe fatal.\nPreviously, scientists had\nshown that there is a \u2018stop\nmechanism\u2019 that regulates\nbrain signals, telling an individual to stop drinking water when\nno longer thirsty. A new study\nled by Monash University has\nshed light on this mechanism,\nrevealing that a \u2018swallowing\ninhibition\u2019 is activated by the\nbrain after excess liquid is con-sumed, helping to maintain the\ncorrect volume of water in the\nbody.\nIn the study, led by associate professor\nMichael Farrell from\nthe Monash\nBiomedicine\nDiscover y\nI n s t i t u t e ,\nr e s e a r c hers asked\nparticipants\nto rate the\na m o u n t\nof effort\nr e q u i r e d\nto swallow water under two\nconditions: when they were\nthirsty after exercising and\nthen later when they were\nsatiated. The results revealed\na three-fold increase in effort\nafter over-drinking, implying\novercoming some sort of resist-ance. This resistance is caused\nby inhibition of the swallowing\nreflex once enough water has\nbeen drunk.\nThe scientists used functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) to measure brain activity\njust prior to swallowing. They\nfound that the pre-frontal areas\nof the brain were much more\nactive during effort-full swallowing than when swallowing\nwhilst thirsty. This suggests that\nthe pre-frontal cortex overrides\nthe swallowing inhibition to\nallow water consumption.\nIn this age of health food\nbloggers, many people are\nformulating their eating and\ndrinking habits around elaborate routines. You can even\nget apps which allow you to\nlog how much you drink and\nremind you when to drink\nmore. However, your own\nbody is the best judge of your\nneeds. Remember that water\nis contained in food and other\nbeverages. Drinking according\nto a schedule whilst ignoring\nsignals from your body can be\ndangerous. Over-drinking can\npotentially leading to water\nintoxication or hyponatremia\n(abnormally low blood sodium\nlevels), leading to lethargy and\nnausea and, in the worst case,\nconvulsions and coma. In rare\ncases, marathon runners have\ndied after drinking excessive\nquantities of water before a\nrace.\nIt seems we needn\u2019t be slaves\nto drinking 8 glasses of water a\nday without reference to thirst.\nYour body is highly skilled at\nmaintaining tightly calibrated\nwater levels, signalling you\nto drink long before you are\ndehydrated and balancing\nwater levels with urine. The\nswallowing inhibition is probably crucial to this process. So,\ntrust your body and drink to\nthirst.\n\\\\ After stopping\nboth treatments, the\nviral cell count was\nundetectable for\nnine months, and\nwas still low two\nyears later \\\\\nF\nact | Sperm takes\nlonger to make than\nyou ever imagined:\n43 million years.\nNo, not quite 43\nmillion years each \u2013\nit takes a mere 60 days for a\nsingle sperm to fully develop.\nThe true scale of the problem of sex comes down to\nthe sheer number of sperm\nrequired to raise the odds of\njust one reaching the egg.\nThe average man will release\n250 million sperm each time\nhe ejaculates. If you made\none sperm at a time, back to\nback, it would take 43 million\nyears to produce that number.\nLuckily, billions of sperm\nstart development every day,\nso you can turn once-in-a-lifetime into 4-times-a-day,\nalthough sending that many\nchildren through university\ncould be pretty crippling\nin 20 years.

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment fcomment@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nI\nwas born and raised in Lagos, the most\npopulated city in Nigeria and in Africa\nas a whole. On September 30th\n2014,\nless than 3 weeks after my 17th\nbirthday,\nprobably the most defining event in my\nlife so far occurred. I moved to London\nto attend Imperial College.\nBefore leaving, my parents gave me\na talk I imagine a fair few of my fellow\nNigerians must have received as well.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go get drunk\u201d (being 17 already\nmade this tricky) \u201cand don\u2019t do anything\nstupid, remember you are there on a visa\nand if you mess up you are coming home.\nPut your studies first, everything else is\nsecondary. Girls can wait till after you\nhave a first class degree and don\u2019t forget\nyour values and morals.\u201d\nBrimming with excitement for my new\nexperience, I probably visited the Freshers\nFacebook group and college and union\nwebsites pretty much every day after\nreceiving my offer, and had already\nadded a bunch of people from the\nFreshers page (a lot of whom I eventually\nnever met in person). I had joined some\nsocieties. I had even been handed my first\ndisappointment, realising that I would be\nbranded with the dreaded red square on\nmy ID and wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the\nmajority of the Freshers events due to my\nage. Regardless, I was looking forward\nto the experience and even managed to\ncontribute some quality Game of Thrones\nbanter on the Freshers page.\nThe estimated population of Lagos is\nsomewhere around 21 million (London\u2019s\nestimated population is 8.6 million, to\nput things in perspective) so in first year\nI was one of the few people who didn\u2019t\nhave to adjust to life in the big city. Lagos\nalso happens to be smaller than London\nin terms of land area (the smallest state\nin Nigeria) so I was pleased to be in a\nless busy city. As na\u00efve as my 17-year-old Fresher self was, I did expect life and\npeople in London to be different from\nwhat I was used to back in Lagos; after all,\nI had visited London a few times before.\nNonetheless, life in London had a sleeve\nfull of surprises waiting for me.\nI remember sitting in a lecture on British\nslang in the Imperial International Student\nWeek (just before Freshers\u2019 week) and\nbeing asked to draw lines matching words\nlike \u2018pissed\u2019 and \u2018knackered\u2019 to their\nmeanings. I remember my first venture\noutside the South Ken bubble since\narriving, walking around Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nMarket and wondering if the Hammersmith\nand City line had brought me to a different\ncity. I remember learning that fancy dress\nmeant funny costumes and not formal\nclothing. I remember learning the great\nBritish art of euphemising: instead of\nsaying \u201cthis soup tastes like crap\u201d, I was to\nsay \u201cthis is probably not the best soup I\u2019ve\never had\u201d.\nThat first October was a massive learning\nperiod for me. There were some slightly\nembarrassing missteps, like when I wore\na suit to my speech when running for year\nrep. I thought I\u2019d be more approachable if\nI left out the tie as everyone else would be\nin suits, obviously. Imagine my horror when\nI showed up to find the other candidates\nin sweaters and t-shirts. There was also\nthe time I went in my traditional wear to\nthe African Carribbean Society welcome\nparty because I thought, since it was\nabout celebrating African and Caribbean\nculture, everyone would wear theirs too,\nobviously. This one hammered home the\nmessage \u2013 sweaters and t-shirts yet again.\nThere were adjustments to be made.\nLagos heat became London rain,\ncomplaining about food with spice excess\nbecame complaining about food\nwith spice deficiency. I had to\nsilence the voice in my head that\ninsisted on converting the price\nof everything I bought to Naira\n(Nigerian currency) and reminding\nme of the extortionate international\nfees any time I wasn\u2019t working. I\nhad to deal with some annoying\nquestions about Africa and people\nexpecting me to know their random\nfriend from school who was from\nTanzania, which for the record\nis further away from Lagos than\nLondon is. I was introduced to\nBritish humour, which a lot of the\ntime did not humour me, but I took\nthe cue from other people\u2019s laughter\nthat something funny had been\nsaid. I was introduced to puns, and\narguments about the pronunciation\nof scone (still have no clue which\none is correct).\nWith time I got better. I learned\nhow to pronounce words like\nWarwick and Woolwich and got\nusedtoexplainingthatEnglishbeing\nmy first language and the official\nlanguage of Nigeria was why I\nspoke it so well. I was brought up in\nan environment where respect for\neldersisemphasisedfromchildhood\nand non-negotiable regardless of\ncircumstance. However, with time,\nI stopped physically cringing when\nI called people significantly older\nthan me by their first name or when\nI overheard a friend shout at and\ntalk back to their parents over the\nphone. I was \u2018integrating\u2019.\nBesides these harmless cultural\ndifferences, I found myself in a\nposition where I had to confront\nand form opinions on many issues,\nsome of which had never crossed\nmy mind. I had been thrown into a\nvast ocean of -isms and -phobias.\nBeing Black in a predominantly\nWhite country, I became aware\nof the reality of racism, a concept\nMy name\nshouldn\u2019t have to\nbe \u2018convenient\u2019\nfor you\nNdidi Ukachi Iwumene discusses\nthe importance of names as a part\nof one\u2019s identity\nM\nost school children\nwould celebrate at the\nglimpse of a substitute\nteacher. Even the most\nwell behaved students\nare relieved to ditch\ntheir teacher\u2019s pet persona momentarily.\nHowever, for some Black minority and\nethnic (BME) students the arrival of a\nsubstitute teacher elicits a familiar dread.\nAs the na\u00efve teacher grasps the register,\nan awkward smile is instinctively plastered\nacross the faces of BME pupils. A smile\nthat is worn as a shield to deflect the\nimminent ridiculing laughter. A series\nof Western European names are called\nout seamlessly and then, at an expected\npoint, an anxious declaration of \u201cI can\u2019t\nsay this one\u201d triggers a wave of giggles.\nThe cackles are even more piercing\nwhen a teacher decides to butcher the\npronunciation of a BME pupil\u2019s name.\nThis may seem trivial, but names are a\nfundamental aspect of self-identity. Hence\nthe everyday derision of ethnic names has\na negative psychological impact.\nNames matter in recruitment, too. So\nmuch can be ignorantly inferred about\na candidate based solely on their name.\nCountless studies have exposed the\nbrazen rejection of applicants with \u2018Black\u2019\nor \u2018African\u2019 names. It is not surprising,\nthen, that last year the UK government\nimposed name-blind UCAS applications.\nThe goal was to help increase participation\nin Higher education (HE) from ethnic\nminority groups. This new initiative was\ngenerally commended but a deeper issue\nstill thrives. How do the aforementioned\ngroups participate socially once within\nthese HE institutions? Names cannot be\nconcealed in social settings. Personally,\non several occasions, my name has been\na social handicap. People have abstained\nfrom conversing with me out of fear of\npronouncing my name wrong. Sounds\nridiculous but it is a genuine and palpable\npredicament for many BME students. The\nuse of only pronouns \u2018she\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019 to refer\nto someone with a non-Western-European\nname is also very common.\nThis too is problematic as\nit cultivates a relational\nbarrier. Knowing and using\nsomeone\u2019s name correctly is\nkey to establishing a personal\nconnection with them.\nIn response to employment\ndiscrimination and social\nawkwardness, many BME\nstudents choose to take\non nicknames or \u2018English\u2019\nnames. The latter was an\nenticing notion for me prior\nto university. I deliberated\nover changing my first name\nto something more \u2018simple\u2019\nbut later refrained from doing\nso. In my opinion, changing\none\u2019s name to conform to an\nenvironment is nonsensical.\nIt snubs unique culture and\ndiscards the story behind a\nname. It amputates identity.\nSlave owners in the 16th\ncentury understood this and\nso christened their slaves with\nWestern names. Today, some\nBlack Americans celebrate\ntheir inheritance of European\nsurnames, and others detest\nit. Nonetheless, their choice of\nname undoubtedly influences\ntheir progression in life.\nFinally, there are examples\nwhich suggest society has\nmoved forward; for instance,\nthe succession of Barack\nHussein Obama to presidency.\nDespite this, Jack Smith is still\nmore likely to be employed\nthan Oluwadamilola Alabi.\nthat had been so foreign to me\ngrowing up in Nigeria. London is\nincredibly diverse, which provides\na big learning opportunity, but at\nthe same time opens up avenues\nfor so many types of discrimination.\nI witnessed the harsh reality\nof this discrimination in the\nexperience of many Londoners\nand its disheartening escalation\nwith recent events like Brexit and\nthe terrorist attacks in Paris and\nBrussels. I found myself learning\nso much about other cultures and\ninternational issues. Every day was\na new awakening to my ignorance.\nI was becoming more \u2018woke\u2019.\nLagos to London has been a\ncomplex and multi-faceted ongoing\ntransition.

I have\nappreciated the exposure attending\nsuch a multi-cultural university\naffords me and have tried to make\nthe most of it. However, I can never\nquite shake the feeling that while I\nhave made many friends and feel\nwelcomed, I have not felt at home.\nLondon has its pluses, like easier\ntransport and 24/7 electricity, but\nthere\u2019s been something missing. I\nhad been so ready to leave Lagos\nfor so long that it seemed ridiculous\nto me that I could start missing some\nof the things that had made me\nwant to leave in the first place.\nLagos to London was a six hour\nflight followed by a colossal\nparadigm shift. Although moving to\nLondon greatly influenced the way\nI think and see the world, moving\n5004km away has actually brought\nmy heart closer to home and made\nme appreciate Lagos more than I\never had in the past.

Different strains and\npreparations tend to have stronger effects due\nto the different amounts of THC contained and\nthe method of absorption. The most common\nway to use cannabis is to smoke it. Unrefined\ndried cannabis can be rolled into cigarettes\nby itself, or along with tobacco. Hash, a resin\nform of cannabis, is often smoked crumbled\ninto tobacco. Marijuana is famously used in\ncooking, traditionally in baked goods, as the\nactive component is absorbed readily when\ndissolved in fats such as butter. Bongs, and\nshisha pipes are often used to smoke cannabis,\nand word has it that the East London hipsters\nare all vaping their weed these days.\nLegality\nIn the UK it is illegal to possess any cannabis. For a first time offence, the police\nmay issue a Cannabis Warning, which does not show up on criminal record\nchecks. A Penalty Notice for Disorder, which is an \u00a380 fine, may be issued on\nthe spot for a second time caught with cannabis, and if this fine is paid promptly,\nno criminal conviction is recorded. If you\u2019re caught more than this, you can be\narrested and be given up to five years in prison and an unlimited fine.\nSurveys show that although the prevalence of marijuana use has increased to an\nall time high, the numbers of arrests and cautions have dropped by around 50%\nsince 2010. In fact, in County Durham, you can grow small numbers of plants for\nyour own personal use, and they\u2019ll turn a blind eye.\nIn many other countries, cannabis is legal. As well as the well known Dutch\ncoffee shops, some countries including Portugal, the Czech Republic, the USA,\nand Uruguay have begun legalising cannabis for recreational or medicinal use\nin recent years. Other countries, such as Jamaica and Switzerland allow you to\npossess very small amounts for personal use, but forbid its sale or distribution.\nThings to do when you\u2019re high\nDo\n\u2022 Watch My Little Pony/cult\nmovies (that don\u2019t make any\nsense except when you\u2019re\nhigh)\n\u2022 Have sex (although be aware\nthat having sex under the\ninfluence may lead to poor\ndecision making, such as\nhaving unprotected sex)\n\u2022 Explore new and exciting\nfood combinations (like Pringles with Nutella \u2013 that shit\ntastes good)\nDon\u2019t\n\u2022 Masturbate (it will be painful\nand frustrating)\n\u2022 Drink (no one wants to\nwhitey)\n\u2022 Watch Horror.

Some\npeople find that it makes them feel\nsleepy and forgetful.\nSmoking weed makes some\npeople feel anxious, and long term\nuse is associated with psychosis,\nhallucinations, and paranoia\nin those who are vulnerable to\nmental illness.\nSome statistics\nCannabis is the most widely used drug in the UK, with 6.9% of adults\naged 16-59 having used it in the last year. Of those who have ever\ntaken illegal drugs (around one in three adults), 93% of them have\ntaken marijuana, and for 82% of them, it was the first drug that they\ntook.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit talktofrank.com\n\n"

Fred\nFyles argues they are closer than you might\nthink and makes the case for the continuation\nof teaching A-level art history.\nB\nrexit is the news\ntopic that, like\nJapanese knot\nweek, just refuses\nto die. Since the\nmorning of the 24th\nJune, when pollsters and\npoliticians alike woke to a\ncountry they didn\u2019t recognise,\nvast portions of the media\nhave been trying to unpick\nthe decision of 52% of voters.\nThere is no aspect of life that\nis safe from Brexit, not even\nlinguistics; the British tongue\nhas been forced to contort\nitself around portmanteaus\nlike Bremain, Bremoaners,\nand Brenial.\nEven the world of art\nisn\u2019t untainted: last week a\nYouGov poll was released,\nwhich served as a perfect\nanalogy for the state of the\nnation, a Brexit in miniature.\nThe poll showed over 4000\nmembers of the public a\nselection of artworks \u2013 from\nclassics like Da Vinci\u2019s Mona\nLisa, through Pop Art, right\nup to the four Turner Prize\nnominees \u2013 and asked\nthem the deceptively simple\nquestion \u2018Is this art?\u2019 None of\nthe works received universal\nacceptance; even Mona Lisa,\nperhaps the most recognisable instance of Western art in\nthe world, was viewed with\nsuspicion by 2% of those\nsurveyed.\nAlongside this, the surveyors\ncollected data about how\nrespondents voted in the EU\nreferendum, and this is where\nthings get really interesting.\nFor nearly all works, those\nwho voted to leave the EU\nwere less likely to think it was\nart than their Remain coun-terparts. This difference was\nparticularly marked in the\nresponses for more abstract\nart, which sharply diverged.\nFor Mark Rothko\u2019s Untitled\n(Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light\nOrange), a classic example\nof Abstract Expressionism,\nthe Remain camp voted 45%\nin favour of it being art,\nwhile in the Leave camp only\n21% thought it was. Similar\ndifferences were found with\nworks by Jackson Pollock,\nAndy Warhol, and Marcel\nDuchamp.\nWhat does this mean? Well,\nthe most obvious argument\nwould be that those voted\nLeave are as closed to free\nartistic expression as they are\nto freedom of movement. It\nit this lack of openness, this\nrefusal to understand the\nother, that most commentators seized upon in the\nrun-up to and fallout from the\nconstitutes \u2018real art\u2019? Critics\ncertainly try, and many live\nup to the caricature of a\nliberal elite: out of touch,\nsnobbish, and uncaring about\npopular tastes. Is it really\nsurprising that the Leave\ncamp \u2013 after rejecting the\nmainstream media, leading\nindustrialists, and global\npolitical leaders \u2013 would\nshun the condescension critics\nregularly place on work that\nis quite visually appealing?\nIf this is the case, then the\nobscene decision from the\ngovernment to scrap art\nhistory A-level makes even\nless sense. The country is\ndivided along fault lines,\nboth political and aesthetic.\nLondon-based liberals feel\ntheir country counterparts\nare backwards while home\ncounty conservatives see metropolitans as a snobbish mob.\nPerhaps if more people were\nexposed to art, and educated\nabout it, there would be less\nBrexit, modernism, and art history\n\\\\ The continuation\nof art education is\nvital, not only for\nmembers of our\nroyal family, but\nfor every person in\nthis country \\\\\nresult; Leave were painted as\nparochial bigots, with no real\nappreciation of European\nculture. Certainly, this has\nan element of truth, but it\u2019s\nan interpretation as basic\nas it is dull. Taking another\nlook at the data, things get\ninteresting.\nThe Leave camp didn\u2019t\noverwhelmingly reject the\nworks they were presented\nwith. There were two works\nwhich more Leavers claimed\nwere art than Remainers \u2013\nThe Singing Butler by Jack\nVettriano, and Mystic Mountain by Bob Ross. Both are\nworks that are by-and-large\ncompletely rejected as real\nworks of art by the majority\nof critics. Jonathan Jones, of\nThe Guardian, said that Vettriano has \u201cno imagination and\nheart\u201d, and paints \u201cfetishistic,\nstylish objects\u2026with a slick\nempty panache\u201d. Similarly,\nBob Ross is better known for\nhis PBS show, which aimed\nto spread the relaxing and\nuplifting potential of painting\nto the masses, rather than any\ncritical acclaim.\nThese results reflect the distrust the Leave camp seemed\nto have of mainstream media\nand metropolitan elites \u2013 as\nMichael Gove quipped,\n\u201cpeople in this country have\nhad enough of experts\u2019\u201d\nIn many ways, they have a\npoint. Can anyone really act\nas an adjudicator of what\nof this ridiculous and pointless\ndivision.\nAnd what of Michael Gove\u2019s\nridiculous idea that art history\nis a \u2018soft\u2019 subject? It is a subject that combines a number\nof other disciples \u2013 knowledge of the politics of the\ncountry and time a work was\nproduced is invaluable. Scientific developments in the art\nof painting form a key part\nof the context in which art is\nmade. Art history engages\nour critical thinking and trains\nour evaluative faculties. Even\nSTEM subjects cannot be\ndivorced from a base of phi-losophy. Art history is rooted\nin the same basis as chemistry\nor biology \u2013 a deep thirst for\nknowledge.\nBrexit was a cry of a\nnumber of individuals who felt\nthey were locked out of the\npolitical arena. What could\nbe the use of locking them out\nof our art galleries too? The\ncontinuation of art education\nis vital, not only for members\nof our royal family, but for\nevery person in this country.\nBy cutting it, we are telling\npeople that the right to view\nart, to engage with it, is nothing more than a \u2018privilege\u2019.\nThe government say that it\nis part of school reform, but\nall I can see is a move that\nwill drain our cultural capital,\nencourage regional divisions,\nand deny people a voice.\n\\\\ There is no aspect\nof life that is safe\nfrom Brexit, not even\nart \\\\\nUnited Kingdom poverty line for two adults and two children: \u00a324,436 as published on the 1st of September 2016 by Michael Dean \\\\ Archives Foundation\n\n"

This d\u00e9cor was\nclearly kept by the current\nowners and set a good tone\nfor the slightly weird bands\non the bill.\nFirst up was Cassels, a two\npiece from London, playing\na really promising brand of\nindie rock. Whilst their lyrics\nwere a bit esoteric at times,\nthe emotional impact of their\nfinal song was undeniable.\nCreative Adult followed\nshortly after. I must admit at\nthis point that I have never\ngotten Creative Adult on\nrecord; their post-punk too\npsychedelic for my taste.\nBy the time the headliners\nSelf Defense Family hit the\nstage the anticipation was\npalatable, with the MOTH\nClub now teaming with a\nflannel wearing, bespectacled\ncrowd. Rather than choosing\nto feed off this excitement\nwith a rowdier song, Self\nDefence instead started off\nwith the miserable plodding\nCottaging, one of their slowest and saddest songs. Crowd\nWith the blocky chords\nshifting and competing for\nspace with the driving bass\nline whilst simple guitar riffs\nswirl amongst them, Tithe\nPig effortlessly achieves the\ncatharsis that so many bands\ntry and fail to achieve. Many\nother bands would choose to\nend their set on such a well\nwritten and performed live\nsong, but that would simply\nnot be Self Defense. Instead\nthey drop into the recently\nreleased long and jammy\nBrittany Murphy in 8 Mile.\nAll in all the gig proved to\nbe a wonderfully cathartic\nexperience.\n\\\\ At no point do\nthese influences\nseem out of placed\nor forced, rather\nit feels all too\ncomfortable \\\\\nC\nited by Noel\nGallagher\nas one of the\nreasons that he\nhas yet to reform\nOasis, Jagwar\nMa\u2019s debut album Howlin\u2019\n(2013) was refreshingly full\nof new and experimental\nriffs, alongside 90s acid-house.

Having supported\nFoals, The xx and Tame\nImpala on tour, elements of\nall three can be heard. Effortlessly shifting and sliding\nbetween both genres and\nlive and synthetic instruments,\nthe album is a showcase by\na band not afraid to play\nby its own rules. Stand out\ntracks include teaser single\nO B 1, which sounds like The\nBig Pink take on trip hop, and\nSay What You Feel, which dissolves from retro 60s vocals\ninto steel drums underpinned\nby a four-to-the-floor beat.\nAt no point do these\ninfluences seem out of place\nor forced, rather it feels all\ntoo comfortable. Lacking\nthe roughshod energy of\nHowlin\u2019, this album is muted\nin comparison. The more\nserious mood \u2013 with a track\nlist reading \u201cFalling; Loose\nEnds; Don\u2019t Make It Right\u201d,\ndoesn\u2019t quite fit with the\nbands carefree and playful\ncharacter.

None of my two roommates\nrespect my rampant cocaine use and my kitchen mates do\nnot share my new love of chinos and bright pink polo shirts\npolos. Therefore Chiris I was wondering if you could help\nme find some new friends, banker friends. I want someone\nwho will take me out for a night out and pay for all my\ndrinks with untattered \u00a350 notes.\nSo Chris will you help me find my way into this confusing\nnew world?\nBest wishes\nKyle Freer\nHey Ham!\nKyle, I see your problem. Not everyone\nfinds it easy to form friendships in the busy\nconfusing world of halls. People who shouldn\u2019t\nlive together are often pushed together and\nmade to get along in ways god would not\nhave intended. So don\u2019t worry, it might not be\ntotally your fault.\nTo find new banker friends I would absolutely\nstart with the degradation of your dangerously\npure morality. It\u2019s hard to fall such a long way\nin a small time so start small, by putting the\ntoilet roll on the wrong way; before slowly\nmoving up to the heady heights of using up the\nlast of your kitchen mates marmite.\nOnce you feel you are suitably degenerate it\nis best to move onto creating a single minded\nunadultered love of money. Start watching\nthe Wolf of Wall Street. That film may have\ncome out last year but the combination of\nLeonardo Di Caprio\u2019s beautiful performance\nas the dastardly Jordan Belfort along with the\ncrisp editing of Martin Scorsese combines to\ngive a satisfying full bodied story that is both\nentertaining and informative.\nNow that you have watched the Wolf of Wall\nStreet once, stop, take a moment to gather\nyour thoughts and start the film again. Now\nyou will be able to properly enjoy the film,\nwatching knowing the end of the film (Jordan\ngoes to prison, #sorrynotsorry) gives the\nensuing screenplay a wonderful pathos which\nprovides the film an undeniable emotional\nimpact.\nAt this point I realise that I haven\u2019t watched the\nWolf of Wall Street for around two days. Soz.\nYours faithfully\nChris\nHOROSCOPES\n\n"

No one had proposed a show for October show\nby the deadline back in June/July but I was around all Summer, being\nin fifth year, so I said to Roshani (MTSoc President) I\u2019d be happy to\nbe MD (Musical Director) if anyone needed one. She asked if I would\nbe interested in directing. And I was like \u201cIf you\u2019re offering, sure, why\nnot.\u201d Apparently they had a few other MDs that were interested but\nno one who wanted to direct. So I said \u201cFine, I\u2019ll give it a shot!\u201d\nThen we were trying to think of small cast, small band, short, low\nbudget shows. I had done 13 with my Youth Theatre company,\nThe Young Theatre, five years ago, and it just happened to be\nthe first show that fit the bill that sprang to mind. Roshani\nwho was also choreographing, liked it as well, so it\nbecame a choice just really instantly.\nSo your directing team, it was you and Roshani?\nAnd Colm Molloy, who was the musical director\nSo how did that come about? The three of you directing\na show together?\nRoshani, as President, was always involved, and was\nhappy to choreograph, especially with the lack of anyone\nelse. I don\u2019t actually know how Colm got involved, I just\nremember Roshani telling me he was MDing.\nDid you do much work beforehand as a directing team before you\nwere let loose on the cast, before or after auditions?\nBefore Auditions, no, very little to be honest. I think the first time I met\nColm was at auditions but we had spoken. And then yes, we did do\na lot of work before rehearsals. Roshani choreographed the whole\nshow, and ended up producing it as well, since she\u2019s president of\nMTSoc and we didn\u2019t have a producer. I did all the blocking, deciding\non set, lights, and deciding where I wanted people to go and how I\nwanted them to do things. So yeah, certainly an awful lot more for the\nstart of rehearsals than the start of auditions.\nHow much rehearsal time did you then actually get with the cast\nbetween auditions and show?\nWe had a month of rehearsals essentially, four weeks and then\nshow week. We rehearsed Sunday afternoons and Monday and\nTuesday evenings. It was probably not quite 12 hours a week\ntotal though most people weren\u2019t needed for everything.\nHow were you feeling by the night of the tech and the\nnight of the dress rehearsal? Were they as horribly\npanicked as they often can be?\nI was optimistic heading into the tech rehearsal and\nit then proceeded to be in contention for the worst\nnight of my life. Things that I thought we had sorted\nbeforehand didn\u2019t happen or didn\u2019t exist. At that point,\nthere was very little that I could do about it. I had done\nthe planning. We\u2019d had a meeting with the tech team and\nbeen through the whole show in a \u2018paper tech\u2019 rehearsal.\nSo we\u2019d been through all of the queues for all of the lighting\nand all of the set changes and how they were going to work\nand then they just didn\u2019t happen. We didn\u2019t have some of the set\nand we didn\u2019t have some of the sound effects.\nAlso, and I probably should have mentioned this earlier, I had to play\none of the parts in the show for lack of people auditioning. There are\nsupposed to be 13 characters in 13. We cut two of them and then I\nMusical Theatre Society recently performed the musical 13 in a double bill with DramSoc\u2019s performance of Hair of the Dog in their annual October show. We catch up with Trent Allen, the show\u2019s\ndirector to talk about how everything went and what it\u2019s like to be a director.\n\\\\ I was optimistic heading into the Tech rehearsal\nand it then proceeded to be\nin contention for the worst\nnight of my life \\\\\nhad to play another because we only had 10 cast members who\nauditioned. We were short a boy. We were also short another boy\nduring the tech rehearsal because he had Techtonics rehearsal. So\nI had to essentially do the work/be in three places at once which\ndidn\u2019t help. All three suffered for it. I wasn\u2019t the most helpful director\nI\u2019m sure, or in the best place.\nThe dress was slightly better than the tech and then the first show\nwas an awful lot better than either. It did go OK in the end.\nWhat was opening night like? Was it scary or did you feel\nprepared by then?\nI was fairly calm come opening night, I think because at\nthat point I\u2019d just accepted that what was going to happen\nwas going to happen and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do\nabout it. Thanks to an awful lot of MTSoc alumni turning\nup in the audience and making it an absolutely fantastic\natmosphere there were laughs right from the get go and it\nwas a wonderful night.\nSo, you\u2019ve had your experience, would you ever be interested\nin directing for MTSoc again?\nYes, I would. Ideally not directing and acting in it, the Kenneth\nBranagh as someone called it. Yeah, it definitely feels like both ends\nsuffered. I certainly only actually got into the part on opening night\nbecause that was the only time that I gave up on everything else,\nsince the directing was done. The directing wasn\u2019t done on the first\nnight but I told myself that it was. So yes, I can definitely see myself\ndirecting again.\nSo you were in a double bill with DramSoc, what did you think of\nthe experience of being in a double bill?\nIt\u2019s certainly a strange dynamic. First off I don\u2019t think we publicised\nclearly enough what was happening. Some people didn\u2019t realise\nthat it was one show then an interval then another show so we\ncould\u2019ve worked on that. Other than that, it worked fine from\nour point of view, we just had to be quiet while DramSoc\ndid their show before we then could then start warming up\nvocally in the interval.\nDid you get a chance to see their show at any point?\nNot on any of the nights, but I did see bits in rehearsal of\ncourse. It seemed funny from what I saw, I grasped the story\nbut yeah I didn\u2019t see the whole show start to finish.\nIn that case my last question is no longer quite so relevant,\nbut it\u2019s one we want the answer to in the office. Has seeing Jack\nSteadman in a romantic role made you fall in love with him?\nI\u2019ve always been in love with Jack Steadman.\n\\\\ I had to play\none of the parts in the\nshow for lack of people\nauditioning \\\\\nT\nhe premise of\nthis show is a\nsimple one. Keith,\nplayed by Jack\nSteadman, wakes\nup hungover as all\nhell and with no memory of\nwhat happened the night\nbefore. Sounds familiar\nright? Unfortunately for Keith\nhe hasn\u2019t woken up having\njust drunk texted an ex like\na normal person but has,\nin fact, made some more\nsignificantly life altering\ndecisions as he discovers over\nthe course of the play.\nThe show is a pretty stereotypical \u2018Waking up in Vegas\u2019\nstory which certainly had the\npotential to feel dated but\nwas actually carried well by\ntalented acting that leaves\nyou feeling thoroughly emotionally involved in the lives\nof these characters. It is a\nromcom by all definitions and\nit plays out over the course of\none very emotionally charged\nday.\nWe follow the much-travelled\njourney of two lifelong friends\nfinally discovering their feelings for one another, feelings\nthat are blindingly obvious to\nthe rest of their friends.\nThe play tracks the\naftermath of a very boozy\nstag/hen night for Keith\u2019s\nbrother, Dave, and Dave\u2019s\nfiancee Lynnie. Keith wakes\nup to find his best friend\nAmy, played by Daisy Rogers-Simmonds, in his room sat\ninnocently on a chair waiting\nfor him with a cup of coffee.\nThe situation is one he does\nnot deal with particularly\ngracefully. In the audience\nwe were trying to work out if\nhe was legitimately hungover\nas it was a particularly\nrelatively engaged with the\ncharacters.\nAlongside the story of Keith\nand Amy, we also watch\nDave and Lynnie who, despite\nsupposed to be getting\nmarried the next day, do not\nseem particularly keen to\nrush home. We follow their\nrelationship\u2019s ups and downs\nthrough Lynnie thinking she\nno longer wants to get mar-ried, to realising it\u2019s only the\nhigh-maintenance wedding\nplanner that Dave\u2019s parents\nhave hired that she\u2019s opposed\nto. Whilst the acting itself\ncan\u2019t be faulted, the text of\nthe play seems to prevent\nthe characters developing\nenough depth to be genuinely\ninvested as an audience\nmember in their lives.\nBy being set almost entirely\nin a single Vegas hotel room,\nset changes were kept to\nalmost none, which definitely\nhelped keep the transition\nbetween scenes smooth.\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed\nthe performance but it\u2019s\nprobably not a play I\u2019d be\nin a hurry to go and see performed by anyone else.\nAbigail de Bruin\nDramSoc does\nHair of the\nDog\n\\\\ He\u2019s missing his\ndignity but also his\ntrousers \\\\\nconvincing scene.\nIt then turns out he\u2019s not only\nmissing his dignity but also\nhis trousers. He\u2019s also left his\nwallet in a wedding chapel.\nAll of his friends proceed to\nbe decidedly unhelpful in\nhelping him get to the bottom\nof what happened.\nIt eventually turns out that\nKeith has asked Amy to\nmarry him. It\u2019s probably not\nthe most dramatic reveal to\never happen but you do stay\n\n"

The thick, orange sauce\ncovered the pair of bones and\nglistened with the light, while\nradiating an appetising fra-grance. A hand-sized circle\nof roti with golden brown\npatches accompanied the\ndish. I couldn\u2019t wait to start.\nWith the marrow scoop,\nI scraped the insides of the\nbone, dolloped the wobbly\nmixture onto a piece of roti\nand threw the combination\ninto my mouth. It was an\nexplosion of textures and\nwonderful flavours. The\nbone marrow melted into\na rich, velvety liquid with\ndeep flavours of lamb. The\ncurry sauce surrounded the\ntongue with welcoming spices\nwith a noticeable kick of\nheat. The roti dissipated into\ncrispy, chewy strands which\nembraced and absorbed the\nsauces.\nThe hopper, the signature\ndish of the restaurant, came\nas a spectacular, thin, bowl\nshaped pancake made from\nfermented rice and coconut\nmilk, with a runny egg splattered at the bottom, all on\na hammered copper tray. It\ncame with three condiments:\npol sambol (a relish made\nwith fresh ground coconut,\nsun dried bonito, onion and\nred chilli), seeni sambol (a\ncaramelised onion relish) and\na coriander chutney.\nI broke off the crispy edge\nof the hopper and dunked it\ninto the bright orange yolk.\nThe pancake became softer\nand chewier towards the\nbottom; the relishes gave\na variety of flavours and\nexperimentation. It was more\nof a snack, but can be a meal\nwhen paired with the many\nkaris available in the menu.\nHoppers definitely proved\nits worth for its hyped reviews\nand multi-starred ratings with\nits friendly ambience and\napproachable menu \u2013 and\nan exciting addition to the\nLondon curry scene!\nH\now do I define a\ncurry?\nI can say that\na curry is that\nexotic, fragrant,\nbright orange-coloured tikka masala in your\ndisposable takeaway box\non Friday curry night, along\nwith poppadoms and yellow\nbasmati rice.\nIn truth it is much more than\nthat. It is a complex combination of herbs and spices,\nvarying cooking algorithms\nand ingredients. Its deep\nhistory is not only exclusive\nto the subcontinent, but with\nmuch loved variations across\nmany countries and religions.\nDespite its many different\ncolours, accompaniments and\nrecipes, we can all agree that\na curry is not just a dish, but\na culture. For me, a curry,\na good curry, is like coming\nhome after a long day\nleashed by lectures and project deadlines \u2013 my ultimate\ncomfort food. Hong Kongstyle curry fish balls set my\nmind back to my childhood\ndays sneaking off to those\nstreet food hawkers in the\nnarrow alleys after school.\nThe balance of mellow spices\nand sweetness in a Japanese\nkatsu curry from Tombo\nembraces my senses like my\nwhite, warm, fluffy bathrobe,\neven during their busy, buzzing lunch hours. The kick of\nheat from Dishoom\u2019s masala\nprawns sends sparks of excitement down my spine like\nwatching a glittery Lush bath\nbomb explode into a galaxy\nof colours in the bath tub.\nDespite our reputation for\ntransforming the wonderful,\nfull-on Indian flavours into\nartificially coloured and\nfrightfully bland adaptations\n(proudly named as the British\nnational dish), London has\nnever ceased to surprise me\nwith spectacular, authentic\ncurries. My last encounter\nwith such a curry was at\nHoppers, a restaurant serving\nauthentic, family-style dishes\ninspired by Sri Lanka and\nTamil Nadu, a South Indian\nstate.\nThis little canteen has\nearned quite some attention\nacross the food community\nsince it opened its doors at 49\nFrith Street, with its cornflower\nblue walls and coral red steps\nagainst the dull brick walls of\nthe rowdy neighbourhood.\nThe no-reservation policy\nguaranteed long queues\noutside the tiny 40-seat restaurant every night. Knowing\nits popularity and tendency to\nform two-hour long queues, I\nvisited at 12am on the dot on\na hot summer weekday (yes,\nI skived off work for that),\njoining a short line of excited\nvisitors who, like me, were\nanticipating the delicious,\nhearty food described in the\nnumerous blogs, articles and\nonline reviews.\nI stepped through the navy\nblue door into an entirely\ndifferent world. The room\nwas dimly lit with warm\nyellow rays from the ceiling\nlights, like rays of sunshine.\nRattan covered the ceilings\nand the walls; the prominent\nearthy colours from the\nfurniture to the tiles and the\nleaves dangling from the\nshelves created an exotic,\nand Lankan Ginger came in\na tall glass with a beautiful\npeach-coloured ombre from\ntop to bottom, garnished with\na strip of rhubarb. The sweet,\nfizzy drink was like a ginger\nale with a bit more heat.\nThe menu was simple and\neasy to read, sectioning\ninto sides, short eats (small\ndishes), kothus (a Sri Lankan\nstreet dish made with a finely\nchopped roti cooked with\nvegetables, meat or seafood)\nand their signature hoppers.\nFollowing the recommendations online, I went for the\nbone marrow varuval from\nthe short eats and their infamous egg hopper.\nThe bone marrow varuval\ncame first on a brown,\nthick-bodied, earthenware\nChristy Lam\n// Curry is not just a\ndish, but a culture //\nholiday-like environment. For\na split second, my mind was\ntransported across the world\nfrom the gloomy British Isles\nto the subcontinent.\nFeeling comfortable in my\nseat by the window, I ordered\none of their special drinks to\nquench my thirst.

Overall the\nlast week of matches has\nput the club on a really solid\nstanding for the rest of the\nyear.\nT\nhough term has only\njust started, Imperial\nnetball have been\nvery busy with\ntrials, and over\nthe last week, the\nfirst matches of the season.\nThe 1s have yet to play their\nfirst match due weather\nconditions but the other teams\nhave been doing the club\nproud with a series of great\nmatches.\nThe first match of the year\nfor the 2s was against UEL,\nmeaning a long journey and\na challenging match. The\nteam were up by a goal by\nthe end of the first quar-ter, which was impressive\nfor a team with three new\nfreshers and a reserve from\nthe 3s. The team played\nwell together as a whole\nbut the second and third\nquarters got tougher as the\nopposition noticed some of\nour weaknesses. The fourth\nquarter was when we came\ninto our own; the defence\nwere making incredible\ninterceptions and the attack\nwere working better than they\nhad all match. This combination led to a quarter win. The\nfinal score was 24-26 with\nZoe Hall (GK/GD) chosen as\nplayer of the match. The 2s\nhave continued this winning\nstreak on Monday with a\n28-20 victory against Kings\u2019\n3s.\nAfter a long trek to Ethos,\nthe 4s began their first match\nof the season against Kings\u2019\nMedics 6s. Getting the ball\ndown court was no challenge,\nhowever the exceptionally tall\nGD and GK meant that shots\non goal were a bit tricky.\nNevertheless, Jess O and\nAlice worked well together in\nthe D and scored some amazing shots. Sadly, the Kings\nshooter didn\u2019t miss a single\nshot and meant that it wasn\u2019t\na win for the 4s that day. But\nhalf-time snacks (that turned\ninto post-game snacks) meant\nthat all-in-all it was a great\nand fun first game for the 4s!\nThe final score was 13-30\nwith the player of the match\nbeing Bibi Wood.\nThe 5s also started out\nstrong by beating Roehampton\u2019s first netball team. It\nwas even more impressive\nsince it was the first time we\nhad played together as a\nteam (some people playing\nfor the first time ever) and\nwe managed to gel really\nwell as a team: defence was\nsolid, passing was snappy\nand shooting was on point.\nThis was reflected in the final\nscore of 36-12 which puts us\non a winning streak of 1 with\nthe player of the match being\nShen Yin Gan. The 3s had a\nstrong first match as well but\nunfortunately lost 40-15, with\nMen\u2019s rugby fails (valiantly)\nAli Zaboronsky\nCharlie Price-Smith. The\nball was then fired out to\nMacbeth, who ghosted\nthrough a tackle before sending the ball back to the safari,\nwhere a grateful giraffe\nsomehow caught the ball and\nloped over the line. Naturally,\nthe conversion was fluffed,\nand the score was back to\n7-5.\nAfter a strong carry, Billy\nsuccumbed to the curse of the\ncaptain, which has claimed\nthe health of the last five\nincumbents.\nHalf time. The game\nresumed after a stern talk on\nthe importance of retaining\nlineout ball. A couple or 7\nmisplaced lineouts later, with\nsome pooey throwing, Henry\nwas consigned to the servants\u2019 quarters for three nights\nby Lord Edward Allingham.\nAt this point Zaboronsky\nentered the field and was\nI\nC 1s XV arrived at\nan unusually warm\nHarlington; the\npristine pitch perfectly\nmaintained by the\nexcellent groundsmen\nover the summer could give\nTwickenham a run for its\nmoney. The game began in\nstunning sunshine with IC\nputting pressure on Brunel all\nover the park. This was lead\nby Matt Blackett\u2019s darting\nruns balanced with a effort\nto maintain decorum, but\nhe failed 2nd\nyear so no one\nreally cares about that.\nToo many penalties cost the\nhome side a lot of territory\nand possession. The tackling\nwas lazy and passive with\ntoo few players putting in\ndominant tackles, leaving the\nofficials with little choice but\nto penalise.\nCreative refereeing of the\nscrum hampered the boys\nin the front row, who were\nunable to make much head-way. The superior Molnar\nbrother and Head battled\nhard but were unable to make\nup for the ref, so the scrum\ntended to be in reverse gear.\nBrunel capitalised on the\nmomentum, and from a\ntapped penalty they finally\ndecided to spread the ball\nwide and target the forwards\nthat IC were forced to field\non the wing. They scored a\npretty dull try.\nThis ignited a spark in\nImperial bellies, and they\ncame out with guns blazing.\nStand-in Captain, Billy, got\nhis dancing shoes on, made\na half-break and offloaded\nto chief back-up dancer Alex\n\u2018The Rhino\u2019 Clayton. Clayton\nput his blunt horn down and\nbarraged a few poachers\nout of the way, then found\nan offload to gameskeeper\npromptly sin-binned within\nthree minutes. Despite this\nidiotic behaviour, IC managed to wrestle back three\npoints to lead the game\n8-7. However, IC struggled\nagainst the increasing wind\nand became pinned back in\ntheir twenty-two and after\nheavy pressure, conceded in\nthe corner. IC pressured hard\nfor a try to clinch victory but\nfell short.\nNotable mention for greying\nfresher Connor who carried\nhard throughout.\nMissed the main man and\ntop dog loads.\nFinal score 14-8 to Brunel,\nman of the match Matt\nBlackett.\ndisc Doctors host beginners\u2019 tournament\nAnthony Featherstone\nall. The players can look\nforward to many outings\ncoming up with BUCS and\nLUSL games as well as mixed\nindoor regionals in a couple\nof weeks and the club can\nlook forward to a successful\nseason.\nL\nast Saturday, Imperial\u2019s\nUltimate Frisbee club\n(aka the disc Doctors)\nhosted a beginner\u2019s\ntournament in Hyde\nPark \u2013 a chance for all\nthe new players to experience\ncompetitive ultimate in a\ntournament scenario whilst\nplaying against other\nbeginner teams from around\nLondon. There were twelve\nteams in total, with Imperial\nbeing able to enter two\nteams: dD Rick and dD Morty.\nThis tournament was a\nchance for the beginners\n(of which there are always\nmany) to learn the basics of\nthe game such as throwing,\ncatching and cutting (move-ment on the field) whilst also\nincorporating lots of fun.\nEarly on in the group\nstages, the weather was fair\nand there was little wind,\nmaking it easy for teams to\nplay and nice to sit around\nwhen they weren\u2019t play-ing. dD Rick and dD Morty\ntopped their pool and finished\nsecond in their pool respec-tively, both going through to\nthe top eight bracket.\nDuring the final round of\ngames, the heavens opened\nin dramatic fashion, dumping\na ridiculous amount of rain\nonto the players. Nonetheless, the games continued\n(albeit with a much more\nslippery disc to catch). The\nfinal was a really great game\nto watch, with both Horsham\nand LSE very evenly matched,\nand a score line to reflect\nthat. At full time, the scores\nwere level, which meant\ncarrying on into \u2018universe\npoint\u2019 (the frisbee version\nof sudden death). Deep into\novertime and in the pouring\nrain, a layout (diving) grab\ngave LSE the victory and the\ntournament win.\nAway from the final, the\ntwo dD teams did themselves\nproud, with dD Rick finishing\nin sixth and dD Morty finishing in eighth. Everyone has\nprogressed greatly from two\nweeks ago when they were\nat the taster sessions learning\nhow to throw to now being\nable to play and understand\nboth the game itself and the\nspirit of the game such as\nintegrity and self-refereeing.\nAll the teams improved\nvastly throughout the tournament and the layout grab\nat the end was proof of\nthat. More generally, as the\nteams played more and more\nmatches, they were able to\nplay much more fluent frisbee\nand maintain possession of\nthe disc more. This showed\nin the score lines and as the\ntournament progressed, the\nscore lines got bigger.\nThe tournament was really\nsuccessful and enjoyed by\nWomen\u2019s rugby fails better (also valiantly)\nRebecca Simpson\nbad fall on her hand. During\nthese times of hardship, Anna\nwas standout with a wicked\nsprint. With natural ease she\nbrought down players that\nbroke through Imperial\u2019s\ndefensive line again and\nagain just metres from the try\nline.\nAt this point, Captain\nA\nclose game\nfull of surprise\nturns and\nbreakout\nstars, with\nthree players\nplaying their first and\ntherefore best match ever.\nThe game was delayed\nthanks to the refereeing company not informing the team\nof a cancellation (again).\nThe coincidental disparity\nbetween the quality of treatment the men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nteams receive for their refereeing needs is amazing, but\nthat\u2019s a discussion for another\nday. Luckily, a delightful\nBrunelian stepped in to ref-eree, choosing a 10\u2019s game\nwith uncontested scrums.\nThe game was off to a flying\nstart. With a strong advance,\nImperial dominated the first\nquarter with a core backbone\nof experienced players. Two\nminor injuries within five\nminutes of play were not\nenough to put anyone off with\nImperial slowly making gains\nup the field. This culminated\nin a scrum just metres from\nthe try line, a tense scene, the\nball precariously held at the\nedge of the second row. It\nwas all on number nine Elizabeth. She darted out, took\nadvantage of a gap in the\ndefence, and ran straight to\nthe try line, scoring between\nthe posts.\nThen out strode the kicker,\nMoran, placing the tee on the\nground and with an almighty\nkick, the ball went soaring\nover and between the posts.\nYet following this excellent\ndisplay, the Imperialites\nbegan to tire and Brunel\nwent on to score three tries to\nImperials 1s. Things went from\nbad to worse as captain Charlotte was forced off after a\nCharlotte insisted on being\nput back on despite several\nsuspected broken fingers\nand quickly scored Imperial\u2019s\nsecond try of the match with\nthe help of Moran and Laura.\nIt goes to show, as long sus-pected, doctors don\u2019t always\nknow best.\nSo, one quarter to go, the\nscore stood 19-12, Imperial\nonly needed one more try\nto break even. Suddenly,\nAnna broke through Brunels\ndefences: \u201cRun! Run!\u201d the\nspectators screamed, and run\nshe did, with the audacity to\noutrun and cross over three\ndifferent opposing players,\nto not only score a try in her\nfirst game from a run half way\nup the pitch, but between the\ngoal posts as well. The Imperial Team ran to swarm her\nin an emotional scene, with\nabout half of them making it,\nthe rest slowing to a walk. The\nImperial team continues to\nwork on its fitness.\nWith a conversion bringing\nthem equal and ten minutes\nto go, Imperial was feeling\ngood \u2013 confident, even. This\nwas dashed when Brunel\u2019s\nstar player was brought back\non and scored two more tries\nbefore the whistle, leaving\nthe final score at 19-31. I\u2019m\nnot saying every time Brunel\nstarted losing they brought\non an England quality player\nto score two tries and then\nimmediately go off, but that\u2019s\ndefinitely what happened.\nStill a great start to the\nSeason for the Imperial\nWomens, they didn\u2019t lose by\ntriple figures and no one got\nbroken (except Charlotte,\nmore like caPain, am I right?).\n\n"

These\nweeks are really important\nespecially for first years who\ndon\u2019t have any idea how\nthings work\u201d, said one CGCU\ndepartmental representative.\n\u201cIn our department the first\nstudent staff committee had to\nbe pushed back a week, but\nsimilarly departments across\ncampus are having to deal\nwith this\u201d\nThe error means that another\nround of elections will have to\ntake place next week.\nProtesting the delay, a letter\nwas sent out by Abhijay\nSood, Physics Dep Rep,\nrequesting that voting for\nthese 73 positions resumes\nASAP and closes on Friday\nas it would normally. Sky\nYarlett, Representation and\nCampaigns Coordinator,\nreportedly said that wouldn\u2019t\nbe possible, however, for a\nnumber of reasons including\nthe election by-laws which\nstate that appropriate notice\nis given (namely \u201c5 clear\nCollege days in advance of\nnominations opening\u201d).\nThe screw up was partly\ndue to the Union\u2019s approach\nto many last minute student\nregistrations. As it\u2019s still early\ndays, and some students have\nonly just recently registered\nwith their departments,\nor are in the process of\nswitching course, their status\nis occasionally not updated in\ntime for the autumn elections.\nThis communication delay\nmight mean that these students\nwill not be eligible to vote\nduring the elections.\nTo allow as many students\nto vote as possible, the Union\nkeeps refreshing registration\ndetails till the very last minute.\nHowever, whereas the last\nrefresh usually occurs before\nthe elections begin, this year\nProfessor Hawking visits Imperial\nTalks about Hawking Radiation. Pfft, show off Matt Johnston\nthat the next big discovery\nis one related to either\nsupersymmetry, or the true\nnature of dark matter but\nacknowledged that it would\nbe even more exciting if\nsomething unexpected was\nfound.\nProfessor Hawking also\npraised the College earlier in\nthe day. \u201cLooking forward,\nImperial College continues\nto be one of the world\u2019s\nleading centres for research\nin theoretical physics, string\ntheory, cosmology, and\nquantum gravity, and the\nCollege should be very\nproud. I am confident that\nthe Theoretical Physics\nE\nsteemed theoretical\nphysics boffin,\nProfessor Stephen\nHawking, gave a\nlecture on Monday\nevening, speaking\non black holes, Hawking\nRadiation, and AI.\nTaking place in a packed\nGreat Hall, Professor\nHawking was introduced via\na video from The Big Bang\nTheory\u2019s Sheldon Cooper\nbefore launching into his\nspeech which largely covered\nthe area of physics that he\nhas become synonymous\nwith, black holes.\n25,000 applications were\nreceived for tickets, but only\na select few managed to gain\nentry to the hour long talk.\n60,000 people have now\nwatched the Facebook Live\nvideo of the Q&A section that\nHawking did after the main\ntalk in which members of the\naudience had the opportunity\nto ask questions.\nOne such question focussed\non the rise of AI, a topic\nwhich Professor Hawking has\nwarned could end mankind.\nIn the talk he said that AI is\nlikely to surpass humans in\nthe next 100 years and hopes\nthat \u201ctheir goals are aligned\nwith ours\u201d.\nThe LHC was also brought\nup with Hawking hoping\nLef Apostolakis\nGroup, including five former\nmembers of my own Relativity\nGroup in Cambridge, will\ncontinue the great tradition of\nfundamental physics research\nat Imperial.\u201d\nHawking also managed to\nadd in a motivational quote\nduring the talk, saying \u201cIf you\nfeel you are in a black hole,\ndon\u2019t give up, there\u2019s a way\nout\u201d.

After\nmoving countries and entering adolescence, I began to\nconsciously avoid listening to\nit; something that thankfully\nI\u2019ve now gotten over.\nFor me, there hasn\u2019t been\nreally much of a reason for\nme to associate with rap and\nhip-hop culture in general,\nbut most notably its music\nhas been synonymous with\nthe urban Black American\nexperience. But that was the\nproblem \u2013 I felt detached\nfrom the scenarios often narrated in the rhymes, lost in the\ngraphic depictions of places\nand people. At the time, it\ndidn\u2019t fit into my personal\nidea of blackness.\nWithin the past decade or\nso, rap as a sub-genre of\nmusic has become gentrified\nbeyond its inner-city roots,\nin that it is no longer solely\ntied to, though it frequently\nreferences, its base culture.\nThis, however, brings with it its\nown problems.\nLike any art piece, when\nyou take rap out of the culture\nfrom which it came from,\nthere is a loss of cultural\ncontext.\nThe original pioneers of hip\nhop infused much of their culture into their music; with their\naccents and cadence, they\npainted the world they saw\nand recorded the language\nthey used.\nLanguage which included\nthe word \u2018n***a\u2019.\n(Now of course, there is a\ndistinction between \u2018n***a\u2019\nand \u2018n****r\u2019, but for all\nintents and purposes we can\nassume them to be one and\nthe same.)\nThe problem with the use of\nthe n-word in hip-hop is that\nbecause it has been so widely\nused in the genre, there is an\nassumption that it is a marker\nof the genre; when it should\nin fact be viewed as indicative\nof the musicians themselves as\npeople.\nConsider the following\nscenario: you\u2019re with friends,\nthere\u2019s music playing and\nKanye\u2019s Gold Digger comes\non. Needless to say it\u2019s\nalways awkward when\nno-one skips that line and\neveryone continues singing.\nWhen I finally began to\nwarm to the themes and\nsounds of hip-hop, this proved\nto be a bit of a stumbling\nblock \u2013 getting into it could\neasily become a commonality\nbetween myself and other\nnon-black friends who may\nhave taken this mutual ground\nas an excuse to go full steam\nahead. What\u2019s worse is when\npeople try to justify it \u2013 the\nindignant, \u201cit\u2019s just a song!\u201d, is\nthe other day a non-black\nfriend of mine was tagged\nin a Facebook post with this\ncaption:\nwho don\u2019t look like them, and\nunderstand why this would\nfeel very uncomfortable.\nLet me be clear on how\nI\u2019m black and I don\u2019t rap\n\\\\ By all means,\nkeep on jamming\nout to your favourite\nKendrick song, just\nbe aware that just\n\u2018cos he gets to say\nn****a, don\u2019t mean\nyou do too \\\\\nI feel, rap music has most\ncertainly gone beyond the\nAfrican-American/Black\ncommunity to permeate and\ninclude some cultures and\nexperiences. But that does\nnot mean that the n-word is\nbound to rap music itself. The\nword is tied to the genre, it\u2019s a\nderivative of the culture from\nwhich the music emerged\nfrom and out of which it\u2019s\npredominantly produced.\nBy all means, keep jamming\nout to your favourite song;\nbut the next time a Kendrick\nsong comes on, be aware\nthat just \u2018cos he gets to say\nn****a, don\u2019t mean you do\ntoo.\n\\\\ It\u2019s always\nawkward when\nno-one skips that\nline and everyone\ncontinues singing \\\\\nHere is what I\u2019m saying \u2013\nmusic is so infused into our\nday-to-day life, we have to\nconsider the fact that it can\nvery easily go from our playlist to our lexicon; and not\neveryone is fine with the way\nthis word is used.\nI once tried to ignore the\nsting of the word, shrugging\nwhen asked \u201cDo you mind\nif I say the n-word?\u201d a few\nyears ago: as far as I was\nconcerned, it didn\u2019t really feature much in my history, or my\nculture, so I was apathetic to\nit. That very quickly changed\nwhen some people, drunk\nwith \u2018new-found freedom\u2019,\naltogether stopped using my\nname.\nDespite coming from a\nbackground and a place\nwhere the \u2018n-word\u2019 essentially\nhad no power, it was still\nrelatively easy for me to learn\nto take offence at it. Now\nconsider those people who\u2019ve\ngrown up in communities\nwhere they\u2019ve historically\nbeen called n****s by people\nThe late, great Tupac Shakur \\\\ Leo Gonzales\n\u2018Modern day blackface\u2019\nor just a poor\nperformance? X Factor\u2019s\nlatest tabloid favourite,\nHoney G, leaves us\nfeeling offended without\nreally knowing why.\nTheo Farah\n\\\\ She proclaims to\nhail from \u201cNorthWeezy. NorthWest London. In\nHarrow\u201d and is most\ndefinitely \u201ctrue to\nthe game\u201d \\\\\nS\nhouting out the\nlyrics to 2pac\u2019s\nCalifornia Love\nwhile panting and\ngyrating across the\nstage, Honey G\u2019s\nfirst live X Factor performance\nwas truly a spectacle. The\nbudding \u201cgenuine urban\u201d\nartist\u2019s short career hasn\u2019t\nbeen lacking in controversy.\nRecently she\u2019s been accused\nof being a \u201cfake\u201d by Little\nMix (of Simon Cowell circa\n2011) and has been subject\nof an opinion piece in The\nGuardian likening her to 19th\ncentury blackface minstrels.\nI admit her performance\nleft me cringing and feeling\nconfused. But trying to\ndisentangle the mess of\nreasons why her act is so off-putting proves to be no easy\ntask.\nIs this political correctness\ngone mad? Cultural appropriation is and always has\nbeen a contentious topic.\nDetermining the point where\ninspiration becomes denigration of a minority groups art\nand history is muddied further\nwhen its agent is farcical. The\nonus lays with Honey G to\nshow us. If like Little Mix you\nsuspect she isn\u2019t a true supplicant to the altar of Hip Hop,\nher act seems like a cynical\nparody of rap culture.\nIggy Azalea, the white-Aus-tralian, Pop-Hip Hop artist,\ncame under fire for misappropriation of black culture\nafter being nominated for\nthe BET Best Female Hip\nHop Artist award in 2014.\nShe was accused by Azalea\nBanks of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d\nparts of black culture while\nignoring its difficult history\nand the issues still faced by\nblack people in the US today.\nWhat particularly irked some\nis Iggy\u2019s \u2018blaccent\u2019, which she\nattributes to learning to rap in\nthe American South. Whether\nappropriated or not, none\ncan deny her genuine musical\ntalent and commitment to her\ngenre, as demonstrated by\nher 129 award nominations.\nWatching Anna Georgette\nGilford\u2019s character Honey\nG leaves us questioning the\nauthenticity of her persona.\nHer clothes feel like a cos-tume, her mannerisms stiff\nand awkward, as if too-little\npractised facing a mirror. A\nfriend from her time at the\nUniversity of Salford told The\nSun she had \u201cdumbed herself\ndown\u201d for the cameras whilst\nmasking her middle class\naccent. Lola Okolosie of The\nGuardian attributes this to a\n\u2018reductive caricature\u2019 of the\nblack rap artists she is cov-ering, \u2018as if blackness is the\nantithesis\u2019 of her white middle\nclass upbringing. But is this\nreally fair?\nThe clue is in the name:\nHoney G is a 15-years-too-late tribute to Sacha Baron\nCohen\u2019s character Ali G.\nHoney G\u2019s true target of\nridicule is those that may be\naccused of cultural appropriation themselves. The British\nHip Hop fans that mimic the\nstyle and mannerisms of their\nfavourite American stars. She\nproclaims to hail from \u201cNorthWeezy. North-West London.\nIn Harrow\u201d and is most\ndefinitely \u201ctrue to the game\u201d.\nHer persona is designed to\nmock her audience. It\u2019s just\na shame that she\u2019s ridiculing\npop culture that hasn\u2019t been\nrelevant for over a decade.\nSo far, the two songs she has\n\u2018performed\u2019 have been Work\nIt (2002) and California Love\n(2005).\nBaron Cohen\u2019s character\nfirst appeared on Channel\n4\u2019s, The 11 O\u2019 Clock Show\nand was immortalised in his\n2002 film, Ali G Indahouse.\nA satirical stereotype of a\n\u201cwhite British suburban male\nwho imitates rap culture\u201d\nhe is permanently decked in\noversized, brightly coloured\nshell suits and draped in gold\nchains. His \u2018rude-boy\u2019 accent\na parody of the BBC Radio\n1 DJ Tim Westwood. Ms Gilford\u2019s persona is a sad mimic\nof Baron Cohen\u2019s original.\nWith the humour that brought\nappeal stripped away, all\nthat\u2019s left is a woman with\npoor fashion sense and limited musical ability.\nNot that Ali G was free\nfrom controversy himself,\nwith critics such as F. Dexter\ncomplaining that by adding\na degree of abstraction he\nallowed the \u201cliberal middle\nclasses to laugh [at black\nstreet culture] while they\nretain their sense of political\ncorrectness.\u201d Our discomfort\nat Anna\u2019s meta-caricature\ncould stem from a sense that\ntruly her performance is still a\nmockery of black stereotypes.\nThis is a typical ploy of the\nX Factor producers: a weaker\nthan average performer that\njust keeps being \u201csaved\u201d by\nthe voters. Plucked from a list\nof the weird and wonderful of\nthe British Isles; sadly deluded\nshower singers that the audience can both ridicule and\npity, they add another element of drama to each week\u2019s\ntheatrical live show. Perhaps\nwhat stings most is the feeling\nof being played by Simon\nCowell as he rides the tabloid\nstorm created by Honey G all\nthe way to the bank.\nWhyareweoffendedbyXFactor\u2019sHoneyG?\n\\\\ The clue is in the\nname: Honey G is\na 15-years-too-late\ntribute to Sacha\nBaron Cohen\u2019s\ncharacter Ali G \\\\\n\\\\ Our discomfort\nat Anna\u2019s meta-caricature could\nstem from a sense\nthat truly her\nperformance is still\na mockery of black\nstereotypes \\\\\n\\\\ Recently she\u2019s\nbeen accused of\nbeing a \u201cfake\u201d by\nLittle Mix \\\\\n\\\\ ITV and Syco Entertainment\n\n"

He first\nappeared in Luke Cage: Hero\nfor Hire in 1972 as part of the\n\u2018Blaxploitation\u2019 movement.\nThe \u2018Blaxploitation\u2019 genre\nof media was one designed\nto target a young, urban,\nand African American\naudience, and is notable\nfor featuring a mainly black\ncast, as well as a primarily\nfunk/soul based soundtrack.\nWhile some considered\nthe \u2018Blaxploitation\u2019 genre\nas representing black\nempowerment, the general\nconsensus is that it was\ninstead just perpetuating\nstereotypes about black\npeople. Its characters\u2019 main\ntraits were almost always\ntheir skin colour and other\nstereotypically connected\nattributes such as being\n\u2018intimidating\u2019 or having a lack\nof respect for authority.\nThankfully, Luke Cage\nmoved past that, as well as\nhis original costume of an\nalmost entirely unbuttoned\nyellow shirt, a chain belt, and\na metal headband thing. As\nhis character, and thankfully\nhis dress sense, improved\nthroughout his comic run,\nhe became one of Marvel\u2019s\nbetter known characters.\nWhile he certainly isn\u2019t as\npopular as Iron Man, he is\nat least well known among\ncomic fans. Luke Cage\u2019s\nhistory in \u2018Blaxploitation\u2019,\nhowever, isn\u2019t forgotten by the\nseries, one shining example\nof this being a scene wherein\nthe use of the n-word by a\nkid prompts Luke to give a\nMartin-Luther-King-esque\nspeech which still gives me\nshivers to watch.\nLuke Cage, played by The\nGood Wife\u2019s Mike Colter,\nwas first introduced in the\nMCU in Jessica Jones as a\nquiet foil and love interest\nto Krysten Ritter\u2019s drunken\ntitular character, a role which\nhe played to a tee. Given\nhis quiet demeanour in that\nseries, some people raised\nconcerns over whether he\ncould hold a whole show\nby himself. Thankfully those\nconcerns were entirely\nunfounded as he plays\na much more conflicted\ncharacter than he did there,\ntorn between helping others\nand keeping himself hidden.\nWhile Colter\u2019s acting is more\nthan sufficient, there are other\nproblems with the series.\nAlthough Luke Cage does\na largely excellent job with\nits characters and the basic\npremise of the show\u2019s story\narc is fine - a petty crime\ndrags Luke into fighting a\nworld of organised crime that\nhe originally had no desire\nto fight \u2013 its pace is not quite\nright. After a slow and tense\nbuild to Luke\u2019s call to action,\ndespite a couple of moments\nthat are clearly designed\nto relieve that tension, it\n\\\\ Its characters\u2019\nmain traits were\nalmost always their\nskin colour and other\nstereotypically connected attributes such\nas being \u2018intimidating\u2019 \\\\\nMo\u2019 powers mo\u2019 problems \\\\ Netflix/Marvel\nLuke Cage, star of Netflix\u2019s latest\nseries \\\\ Netflix/Marvel\nnever quite feels like that\ntension is paid off. Don\u2019t get\nme wrong, there are some\nintensely cool moments, most\nof them juxtaposed against\nthe various songs playing\nin a club called Harlem\u2019s\nParadise, one of the key\nlocations, but (almost) none\nof them ever felt like they\ntruly hit their mark. Beyond\nthat and the script for one\nparticular character (Spoilers:\nIt\u2019s Diamondback) who kept\nquoting cringey Christian\nscripture like a robotic\npreacher on a loop, it truly is\nan excellent show.\nAs weird as it is to write, one\nof the things that sold me on\nthis show was the abundance\nof references that I had\nabsolutely no clue about.\nWhether it be the usage of\na specific type of coffee for\nthe oft-used swear jar, or a\ndebate regarding various\nblack pulp fiction writers, the\nusage of each reference that\nI didn\u2019t get was a reference\nthat someone else did,\nanother party being catered\nto beyond young white men.\nLuke Cage surrounds itself in\nthe culture of Harlem, and\nblack America in general,\nbasking in the people and\nplaces that make it what it is.\nFrom being the main driving\nforce behind one of the major\nantagonists of the series to\nthe reason why Luke stays\nand fights a battle that he\ndoesn\u2019t have to, it\u2019s clear that\nHarlem is the true protagonist\nof this story, and quite\nfittingly, a bulletproof black\nman in a hoodie filled with\nbullet holes its agent.\n\n"

People\nmade out of\nsharp angles and\nbrightly coloured\ngeometric shapes\nstacked on each\nother in a wild, psychedelic\nform of portraiture. This is\nwhat defines Picasso in the\npublic perception. Picasso\u2019s\nportraits at the National\nPortrait Gallery certainly\ndeliver on that front, but far\nmore intriguingly places his\ncubist work in the context\nof Picasso\u2019s entire oeuvre\nwhich encompasses a range\nwider than certainly I had\nanticipated.\nThe NPG has gathered\ntogether all sorts for this exhibition from huge canvases of\nalmost Impressionistic work to\ndoodles on tablecloths, mixed\nmedia collages, sculpture,\nand of course his cubist\npaintings.\nThe exhibition, spanning\nwork from the several\ndecades of Pablo Picasso\u2019s\ncareer, weaves through his\nmany phases, and reveals a\ngreat deal of the evolution\nof his style and his work.\nMore importantly perhaps,\nit reveals a great deal about\nPicasso\u2019s attitudes to women,\nto himself, and to other\nartists.\nWe witness the beginning\nof a career with cartoons\ndrawn for friends, these are\nscratchy, exaggerated caricatures brimming full of life and\ncharacter. In another room,\nthere is the maginificent\nPortrait of Sebasti\u00e0 Junyer\ni Vidal (1903), a prominent\nwork from his Blue period.\nThe figures seem to glow, lit\nfrom within. Running down\nthe corridor connecting two\ngallery spaces are small\ncollages of unflattering drawings of Picasso\u2019s friend and\nassistant, Jaume Sabart\u00e9s. He\nis shown as a small man with\ncartoonish bulbous features\nleering at gorgeous women:\nglamourous actresses cut out\nlong, straight nose, and the\nsame almond shaped eyes.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why the\ngoddess of wartime wisdom,\na symbol of strength and\nfortitude, might\u2019ve been on\nPicasso\u2019s mind at the time. The\nAthena motif is recurring. In\nthe 1931 bronze Head of a\nPicasso\u2019sportraitsrevealmoreabouttheartist\nIndira Mallik\nfrom magazines.\nDotted throughout the\nrooms are sculptures quite\ndifferent from the surreal,\nfiercely modern work\nexhibited at the Museum of\nModern Art in New York last\nyear. One in particular stands\nout: 1909 bronze Head of a\nWoman (Fernande Olivier)\nis cubism rendered 3D.\nHere, Olivier\u2019s face appears\ngnarled, distinctly reptilian,\nlike plates on a metal suit\nof arms or the shell on an\narmadillo. Others, more than\nanything, reveal the impact\nand influence classical art\nhad on Picasso. Head of\na Woman (Dora Maar),\nsculptured during the second\nWorld War in 1941, could be\na bust of Athena lifted straight\nfrom ancient Rome; the same\n\\\\ Picasso\u2019s subjects\nare deconstructed in\nthe cubist tradition;\npulled apart and re-stitched in\ntechnicolour \\\\\nA Woman in a Hat (Olga) by Pablo Picasso \\\\ Collection Centre Pompidou, Dist. RMN Grand\nPalais\nWoman (Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se) there\nthe profile is again, and in the\n1962 Jacqueline with a Yellow\nRibbon the same features are\npresent.\nMuch of this exhibition\nrevolves around Picasso\u2019s\nportrayal of women. An\nentire room is dedicated\nto Picasso\u2019s paintings of his\nfirst wife, Olga Stepanovna\nKhokhlova. The paintings\nearly on in their relationship\nare figurative, traditionally\nbeautiful. In the 1923 Portrait of Olga Picasso, Olga\nappears against a plain\nbackground, flatteringly lit.\nShe looks regal, but there is\na coldness, an aloofness that\nis at odds with the wit and joy\nin the caricatures of Picasso\u2019s\nfriends in the cubist paintings.\nA later portrait, Woman\nin a Hat (Olga), painted\nin 1935, the year of their\nseparation, Olga is replaced\nby white and green shapes,\ntwo over-large staring eyes\nand uncertain black slash for\na mouth. Atop this forlorn\ncollection of shapes sits a\nlarge upturned kidney bean\nshaped purple hat (Picasso,\nit seems, was never a fan of\nOlga\u2019s dress sense). Olga, the\nwoman, has been cut down\nand restructured, somehow\nmade emotionally available\nto the viewer. Woman in a\nHat packs much more of an\nemotional punch than Portrait\nof Olga Picasso, but Olga\nhas been rendered pitiful.\nThis room, and the one that\nfollows, displays Picasso\u2019s\nportraits of his subsequent\nlovers and wives and serves\nonly to make clear what\nPicasso thought of women.\n\u201cThere are only two types of\nwomen:\u201d he said, \u201cgoddesses\nand doormats\u201c. The women,\nearly on in their acquaintance\nwith Picasso, appear in figurative paintings or drawings,\ngoddess-like. They are almost\nnever looking at the viewer\nand are out of reach. As the\nwomen become more familiar\nto Picasso they are deconstructed in the cubist tradition,\npulled apart and re-stitched in\ntechnicolour. They somehow\nbecome more present and at\nthe same time are abstract,\nrobbed of their humanity.\nMen are almost never given\nthe same treatment.\nThe men Picasso paints are\nthose he respects. He borrows\nthemes from Matisse, Ingres\nand Velasquez, placing\nhimself in the pantheon of the\nEuropean artists.\nThe most revealing of the\nworks displayed is a self por-trait. A small monkey dances\nwith a grin on its face. This is\nhow Picasso saw himself, an\nimpish rebel, even as he was\nhailed as one the century\u2019s\ngreatest artists.\nMany have accused Picasso\nof rampant misogyny, many\nother of genius; this exhibition\ndisplays all these facets\nwithout flinching. The NPG\nhas gathered together some\nrarely seen works. It\u2019s worth\ngoing if only to see what all\nthe fuss is about.\nPicasso Portraits is on at the\nNational Portrait Gallery until\n5th\nFebruary 2017\nTickets from \u00a314.50\n\\\\ Picasso\u2019s cubist\nsculpture is vaguely\nreptilian, like plates\non a suit of armour\nor the shell on an\narmadillo \\\\\nThe Crucible\nand the\npolitics of fear\nG\nod may be\ndead, but\nMiller\u2019s legacy\nlives on in a\nrefreshing\ntake on The\nCrucible at Guildhall\u2019s Milton\nCourt theatre. The Crucible\ngives a semi-fictionalised\naccount of the Salem witch\ntrails that occurred in\nMassachusetts Bay Colony\nat the end of the 17th\ncentury.\nIn an escalating atmosphere\nof religious paranoia, mass\nhysteria sweeps through\nSalem village as bewildered\nchildren \u2018confess\u2019 to alleged\ncrimes of witchcraft and\nbegin to testify against their\nneighbours. The accused are\nsentenced to die while the\nconfessors are rewarded with\nimpunity.\nWritten during the second\nRed Scare in 1952 the play\nis intended as an allegory\nof McCarthyism and an\nindictment of the House of\nRepresentatives. The consequences of state paranoia of\ncommunism were high; 320\nartists were blacklisted on\nthe basis of unsubstantiated\nrumours, and Miller himself\nwas questioned by the House\nUn-American Activities\nCommittee. In this crucible\nof suspicion, all individuals\nbecome subject to unbearable pressures.\nThese themes are entirely\npertinent today. One doesn\u2019t\nhave to look far to see how\nterrorism in the 21st\ncentury\nbreeds vigilance and mistrust.\nNor are we still surprised\nthat Trump\u2019s jingoisms have\nreached the level of fanatical.\nAre we experiencing McCarthyism in the modern age?\nThis was certainly a question\nI was pondering as I left the\ntheatre, a tribute to an immer-sive performance.\nContinuity-wise, the performance does not stray far\nfrom classic interpretations.\nIn 1953, the play\u2019s first\nbroadway run received poor\nreviews, and Miller chastised\nthe over-stylised production\nand its \u201cpitiless sets of rude\nbuildings\u201d. The subsequent\nre-cast was far less embellished in nature, and this is the\nvein in which director Mike\nAlfred has conducted the\nGuildhall performance.\nThe production is\nEzra Kitson\nminimal. The stage is bare\nof everything except a few\nwooden benches and props\nare used rarely. A backdrop\nof knotted rope hangs as an\nominous reminder of the fate\nawaiting the accused. There\nis no music, and little off-stage\ndialogue means the actors on\nstage are constantly the focus\nof our eyes and ears. The\nstage is well lit, contributing to\na lurid atmosphere of disquiet\nand surveillance.\nThe performances are\nimpressively assured, especially given the age of the\ncast (all final year students\nat Guildhall). The pacing is\ngood and the dialogue felt\nauthentic and well accented\nto reflect the British heritage\nof the early pilgrims. Particular mention should be\ngiven to Caleb Roberts for a\nconvincing portrayal of John\nProcter and Martin Quinn for\nthe charisma he lent Reverend\nHale. The calibre of talent at\nGuildhall is evidently high\nand difficult roles such as\nTituba and Marry Warren\nwere filled seamlessly.\nOverall, this is a successful\ntake on Miller\u2019s work and\na great piece of amateur\ntheatre. Guildhall tickets are\ncheap and the experience is\nwell worth it. I would encourage any fans of theatre to\nseek out performances like\nthis one.\n\\\\ The Crucible,\ninitially a response\nto McCarthyism and\nparanoia towards\ncommunism, is just as\nrelevant to today\u2019s\npolitical climate \\\\\nThe Crucible is at The Milton\nCourt Theatre, until 22nd\nOctober 2016.\nEvery day 2.00pm or 7\n.00pm\nTickets \u00a310.

This presumably\ngives College a bit more\nautonomy as to who they could\nhire.\nOne way touted as a method\ntohelpwiththereducedfreedom\nof movement is the European\nPartners Fund which college\nis establishing. \u00a3100,000 a\nyear will be made available\nfor Imperial academics to\nboth \u201cdevelop collaborations\nin Europe which lead to new\nscience and to applications\nfor external funding\u201d.

Thriving\ncompanies are in the interest of\npretty much most people so this\nseems a great idea, how much\nsway Imperial will actually have\nin consultations (if there even\nare any) remains to be see\nThe letter then takes a more\npersonal note as Gast almost\nurges readers to focus on things\nother than Brexit, things which\nare more important. \u201cOne of\nthe things that most worries\nme about the outcome of the\nEU Referendum is the amount\nof intellectual energy that\n\\\\ Gast almost\nurges readers to\nfocus on things\nother than Brexit,\nthings which are\nmore important \\\\\neveryone is expending on this\ntopic at the cost of other more\nforward-looking and positive\nthings\u201d.\nWhilst the referendum has\ntaken up a decent chunk of\nairtime in the past few months, it\nhas the potential to be a pivotal\nmoment for both future careers\nand research. These will affect\nstudents and academics alike\nand a dialogue still needs to be\nhad.\nImperial\u2019s performance in\nthe National Student Survey\n(NSS) was also mentioned, with\na five percent drop in overall\nsatisfaction attributed to some\nstudents feeling \u201cunseen and\nunheard\u201d.

But actually, more\nthan twice as many (approx\n20%) said they would date\nsomeone with a vocal racial\nbias and over four times\nthat number said they prefer\ndating individuals of their\nown race. Now remember.\nThe sample size is 25 million.\nSo we\u2019re talking big numbers\nhere.\nLooking more closely at\ntheir data, they saw that\noverall white males got\nthe most replies when they\ninitiated the conversation\nwhile they tended to ignore\nmessages from black women.\nSimilarly, white women\ntended to almost exclusively\nreply to white men. The same\npreference was not only also\nexhibited in Hispanic and\nAsian women, it was actually\nmore pronounced.\nWhat do these numbers\nmean? Well, we still maintain\na fair amount of racial bias.\nWhiteness is desireable. And\nhow can it not be when it\u2019s\nthe prevalent standard of\nbeauty in the fashion indus-try? When it\u2019s associated\nwith power in politics, or with\nbrains in academia. When a\npairing of colour with crime,\nimmigration, and extremism is\nconstructed on a daily basis?\nSome of the clearest illustrations of the desirability of\nwhiteness can probably come\nfrom Grindr, a popular gay\nhookup app, though I often\nthink of it as a meat market.\nradius found two profiles\ncashing in on the fetishisation\nof gay black men (with the\ninspired names \u201cBlackguy\u201d\nand \u201cBlacktop\u201d), one profile\nfetishising black men (\u201cmore\nattracted into darker skin\nguys\u201d) and one profile who\nwasn\u2019t into Asians \u201cunless\nmuscular\u201d.\n\u201cRacial bias is nothing new\nto me whether it\u2019s in the job\nmarket or a dating app,\u201d says\na black user who wishes to\nremain anonymous. \u201cThe realistic view is that black guys\nare fetishised and criminal-ised at the same time. We are\nnot playing at the same field\n[sic]\u201d. Indeed racial fetishisa-tion is just a different side of\nthe same coin. It is a result\nof racial stereotyping, with\nobjectification as an added\nbonus. Homi Bhabha, a very\nimportant figure in postcolonial studies, argues that racial\nfetishism stems from colonial\ndiscourse, i.e. a discourse that\nrecognises yet denies racial\ndifferences at the same time,\nallowing the construction of\nthe \u2018other\u2019 and its demo-nisation and simultaneous\nidolisation.\nTinder, due to the swiping\nmechanism is harder to inves-tigate. Again you construct a\nprofile, but you\u2019re randomly\npitted against other profiles,\nwhich you then have to swipe\nleft or right on, depending on\nwhether you like them or not.\nIf you both swipe right there\u2019s\na match and a platform for\nconversation is unlocked. This\nallows racial bias to remain\nrelatively conspicuous. Yet\nracism always finds a way.\n\u201cI had a (white) guy on\nTinder ask me if I had ever\nbeen with a black guy. I\nasked why he was asking and\nhe said he wouldn\u2019t sleep with\nme if I\u2019d slept with a black\nguy. Suffice to say he didn\u2019t\nmake it to a date\u201d, says an\nanonymous Imperial student.\nWe are genetically\ndesigned to seek out partners\nas different to us as possible.\nDifferent genetic makeups\ndecrease the risk of inbreed-ing, increase the chances\nof finding a partner with\na complementary immune\nsystem and produce healthier\noffspring. Some theorise that\nthe reason Brazilians are\nconsidered so attractive it that\nthey are one of the planet\u2019s\nmost outbred populations.\nSo it\u2019s truly remarkable that\na social construct such as\nracial bias can make us go so\nstrongly against our nature.\nWhether race is real or\nconstructed (it\u2019s constructed)\nis irrelevant, because race\nhas been used as a tool to\nmould society for centuries.\nRace butts into our collective\ndiscourse every time there\u2019s\ninternational conflict, whether\nthat is cultural, financial or\nplain old war. It is used as\nthe main fence to partition\nideologies, beliefs and ways\nof life. So instead of denying\nracial bias in dating, let\u2019s\nlook it straight in the eye and\naddress it.\nLef Apostolakis\n\\\\ If you deny that\nit\u2019s an integral part\nof our society, you\u2019re\neither an alien or\nwhite \\\\\n\\\\ The realistic view\nis that black guys\nare fetishised and\ncriminalised at the\nsame time \\\\\nYour profile includes stats\nsuch as height, weight, body\ntype and race. There is no\nswiping, on the contrary you\nare presented with a grid of\nusers in order of proximity.\nYou are able to do advanced\nsearches and filter through\npotential mates, based on\nthe above characteristics.\nAnd of course there is the\noption for total anonymity.\nAll these features combined\nallow for a good deal of\nracism.\nFrom the fetishisation of certain races \u201cBlack to the front\u201d\nto the blatant discrimination\nagainst others \u201cNo fems, no\nfats, no asians\u201d\u2013 Yes, this\nstaple text from real profiles\nand far more common than\nit should be.

Undeterred, West\nheaded to Temple University in 1953 where he received his BSc in Physics in and was later hired for a full-time position as an acoustical scientist.\n\\\\ John Hopkins University\n\\\\ Howard University\nMark Dean | 1957 \u2013 Present\nComputer scientist and engineer Mark Dean helped develop a number\nof landmark technologies for IBM, including the colour PC monitor and\nfirst gigahertz chip. He holds 3 of the company\u2019s original 9 patents, with\n20 more patents associated with his name.\nHe is credited with helping to launch the personal computer age\nwith work that made the machines more accessible and powerful.\nIn 1979, he graduated at the top of his class at the University of Tennessee,\n\\\\ IBM\nCharles Drew | 1904 \u20131950\nCharles Drew was an African-American surgeon who pioneered\nmethods of storing blood plasma for transfusion and organized the first\nlarge-scale blood bank in the U.S.\nIn 1938, Drew received a Rockefeller Fellowship to study at Columbia. Drew developed a method for processing and preserving blood\nplasma. Plasma lasts much longer than whole blood, making it possible to be stored or \u201cbanked\u201d for longer periods of time. His research\nserved as the basis of his doctorate thesis, \u201cBanked Blood,\u201d making\nhim the first African-American to earn this degree from Columbia.\nDaniel Hale Williams | 1856 \u2013 1931\nDaniel Hale Williams was one of the first physicians to perform open-heart surgery in the United States and founded the first hospital with\ninterracial staff.\nDue to the discrimination of the day, African-American citizens were still barred from being admitted to hospitals and black\ndoctors were refused staff positions. Believing this needed to\nchange, in 1891 Williams opened the Provident Hospital and\nTraining School for Nurses, the nation\u2019s first interracial hospital.\n\\\\ TradingCardsNPS\nGeorge Washington Carver | 1864 \u2013 1943\nVery few discussions on influential black scientists go by without\nmention of George Washington Carver. He was a brilliant botanist\nwho invented hundreds of products from peanuts and other crops,\nproducing substances that included plastics, paints, dyes and even a\nkind of gasoline.\nHe was born into slavery in Missouri around 1864. A year later, slavery\nwas abolished in that area, and his former owner\u2019s wife taught him to read\nand write as schools did not take black students. In his free time, he studied\nnature and developed a prodigious talent for botany.\n\\\\ NASA\nThis Black History Month, we\u2019d like to celebrate some black individuals who\u2019ve made significant contributions to science. It\u2019s important to acknowledge the resilience of these individuals, many of\nwhom faced the very harsh realities of systemic and institutional racism. Most suffered setbacks due to the colour of their skin and some were even born into slavery.\nMae C.

Jemison made history in 1987 as the first\nAfrican-American woman admitted into the astronaut training pro-gram. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, she blasted off aboard the Endeavour\nshuttle in 1992, becoming the first African-American woman in space.\nBorn in Alabama in 1956, she spent a lot of time growing up reading\nabout science and was a consistent honours student at school. She finished\nhigh school with a scholarship to study at Stanford where she got a BSc in Chemical Engineering whilst being head of the Black Students\u2019 Union, and participating\nPercy Lavon Julian | 1899 \u2013 1975\nChemist Percy Julian was a pioneer in the synthesis of medicinal drugs\nsuch as cortisone, steroids and birth control pills. Although his race\npresented challenges at every turn, he is regarded as one of the most\ninfluential chemists in American history.\nDespite earning international acclaim for synthesising a drug that could\ntreat glaucoma, the university he was researching at still refused to make\nhim a full professor because of his skin colour.\nJulian applied for jobs at prominent chemical companies, but was\nrepeatedly rejected when hiring managers discovered that he was black.\nUltimately, he obtained a position at Glidden Company as lab director,\n\\\\ National Library of Medicine\n\\\\ ChemHeritage\nPatricia Bath | 1942 \u2013 Present\nAmong many firsts, Patricia Bath is the first African American\nto complete a residency in ophthalmology, the branch of medicine looking at the disorders of the eye. She was also the first\nAfrican-American female doctor to receive a medical patent. She\ninvented the Laserphaco Probe for cataract treatment in 1986.\nThrough her studies at Columbia University, she discovered that\nAfrican Americans were twice as likely to suffer from blindness than\nCelebrating black scientists\nEventually in 1891, he began his botanical studies as the first black\nstudent at Iowa State Agricultural College, excelling at his studies\nand establishing his reputation as a brilliant botanist.\nHis ground-breaking research on plant biology brought him to\ncritical acclaim, but he also did important research on crop rotation\nand alternative cash crops for farmers in areas heavily planted\nwith cotton. His work directly contributed to economic stabilisation\namong the black population as he focused his research on struggling farmers who were formerly slaves.\nin dance and theatre productions.\nShe got her M.D. in 1981 and later worked as a GP. For the next\ntwo and a half years she was a Peace Corps Medical Officer in Sierra\nLeone and Liberia where she taught and did medical research. When\nshe got back to the US in 1985, she applied for the astronaut training\nprogram and went on to make history. During her eight days in space,\nshe conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on\nthe crew and herself.\nwhere he invented Aero-Foam, a product that uses soy protein to\nextinguish oil and gas fires. He continued his biomedical work,\ndiscovering how to synthesize the hormones progesterone and\ntestosterone, to be used in hormonal contraception. He was also\nlauded for his synthesis of cortisone, which became used in the\ntreatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\nJulian left Glidden and established his own laboratory, in 1954.\nHe sold the company in 1961, becoming one of the first black\nmillionaires, before founding Julian Research Institute, a non-profit\norganization that he ran for the rest of his life.\nother patients to which she attended, and eight times more likely to\ndevelop glaucoma. Her research led her to development a community\nophthalmology system, which increased the amount of eye care given\nto those who were unable to afford treatment.\nIn 1976, Bath co-founded the American Institute for the Prevention of\nBlindness, which established that \u201ceyesight is a basic human right.\u201d\nwhere he studied engineering. Not long after college Dean\nlanded a job at IBM, a company he would become associated with for the duration of his career. In 1999, Dean led\na team of engineers at IBM\u2019s Austin, Texas, lab to create\nthe first gigahertz chip\u2014a revolutionary piece of technology\nthat is able to do a billion calculations a second.\nIn 1960, West teamed up with fellow scientist Gerhard M. Sessler\nto develop an inexpensive, highly sensitive, compact microphone. In\n2 years they finished development on the product, which relied on\ntheir invention of electret transducers. By 1968, these microphones\nwere being mass produced. West\u2019s and Sessler\u2019s invention became\nthe industry standard, and today can be found in telephones, tape\nrecorders, camcorders, baby monitors and hearing aids.\nAs World War II raged in Europe, Drew was asked to head a\nspecial medical effort known as \u201cBlood for Britain.\u201d He organised\nthe collection and processing of blood plasma from several New\nYork hospitals, and the shipments of these life-saving materials\noverseas to treat casualities in the war.\nAfter creating two of the first blood banks, Drew returned to\nHoward University in 1941.

There\nis definitely more satisfaction\nin eating a meal that you\nhave played a part in creat-ing. Therefore, dear reader,\nI don\u2019t ask of you to use\nthis recipe for future meals,\nalthough you are, of course,\nmost welcome to, but I ask of\nyou to be more open about\nyour cooking. Take this article\nwith a pinch of salt, quite\nliterally, and don\u2019t be afraid\nto make a hash out of your\nmeal, figuratively speaking,\nafter all, if everything doesn\u2019t\ngo to plan there is always\nDeliveroo (have I plugged\nthese guys enough yet?).\nExchange ideas for recipes\nand cook together with\nfriends. The most enjoyable\npart of the whole process was\nthe social side to cooking with\nmy housemate, and I will be\nsure to give another meal a\ngo in the next few days. Bring\nit on.\nI\nam a man of few talents.\nIn fact, I\u2019m a man of such\nfew talents that one of my\nfew skills is to essentially\nboast to anyone and\neveryone of how\nuntalented I am at a given\nactivity. Take, for example,\ncooking. I will happily, nay,\nconfidently tell you how I\nam on first name basis with\nmost Deliveroo drivers,\nhow my first potato cutting\nexperience was straight out\nof a Tarantino movie or how\nmy housemate (God bless his\nsoul) had to promise my dear\nmother on the phone that he\nwould make sure that I ate\nwell this year.\nSo it was on the 10th\nof\nOctober a great surprise to\nwake up to find that I would\nbe writing for the Food\nColumn of felix. Now to say\nthat I don\u2019t enjoy food would\nbe a lie. Quite the opposite in\nfact, I enjoy the eating of food\nand take part in the act daily\n(one of the aforementioned\ntalents), or browsing Ainsley\nHarriet based memes online,\nI have just never been one to\ncreate my own such food. But\nto write about making it? This\nwas surely beyond me; a task\nakin to the Daily Mail writing\narticles on politics. Preposterous. Ridiculous. Impossible.\nI accepted. (Joke\u2019s on you\nfelix, muhaha.)\nAfter all, cooking is a\nfantastic skill to acquire, and\nI thought that if even I could\nlearn one simple meal at a\ntime, then maybe this may be\nof help to other closet baker\nflakers at Imperial to seize the\nspatula and open the oven.\nWhat follows in the next few\nparagraphs is a record of my\nattempts to create what has\nbeen optimistically entitled\n\u201cThe Best Spaghetti Bolognaise\u201d on the recipe section of\nthe BBC website. I hope this\nmay be of use; perhaps as\na guide of what not to do as\nmuch as a useful recipe, but a\nguide nonetheless of cheap,\neasily-prepared meals for a\nbusy student.\nIngredients\n\u2022Onions and Garlic\n\u2022Pasta\n\u2022Bolognaise Sauce (cheeky\nshout-out to my go-to bolognaise boy, Lloyd Grossman,\navailable at all good\nsupermarkets)\n\u2022Parmesan\n\u2022Mince\n\u2022Seasoning\n\u2022Lea and Perrins\u2019 Sauce\n\u2022Olive Oil\nPrice Below \u00a310 for over 3\nmeals worth of food.\nStep 1 In which the onion\nand garlic were chopped\nThis was an emotional\nmoment for me; with my first\nstep into the world of cook-ery, I began to cry. But with\nthe support of my housemate,\nwe were able to successfully\ndice the onion and garlic.\nWith the first sharp-edged\nhazard avoided, the next\ntask was to face fire. Having\nsuccessfully scored a hat-trick\nof oven burns in my first year\nfreshers\u2019 week, I was determined to not let the same\nfate befall me this year. With\ngreat care, the onions, some\nchopped garlic and some\nolive oil were placed into the\npan and into the fire, with\nafter approximately five min-utes. Salt and pepper were\nalso added to the meat at this\ntime. The lid was placed on\nthe pan, and a bottle of wine\nwas opened. The wine was\nconsumed over a period of\nfive minutes.\nStep 4 In which not a lot\noccurred\nWine had been consumed,\nand what happened over\nthe following ten minutes\nis unknown.

There is a\ngeneral consensus right\nnow in the media that\n2016 has been, for lack of\na better word, a shitshow.\nBut as a person who has\nexperienced sexual assault,\nthe last week has basically\nbeen a living nightmare.\nFor those of you living under\na rock, recently a recording\nwas released where Donald\nTrump jokes about being\ngrabbing and kissing women\nwithout their consent. The\nTrump campaign has tried to\ndismiss this as \u201clocker room\nbanter\u201d that all men partake\nin, which does nothing but\nsuggest that he must have a\nvery low opinion of his fellow\nman.\nHowever, since those tapes\nwere released, ten women\nhave come forward with\nstories about how they were\nsexually assaulted/harassed\nby Trump over the last 30 years\nand Trump\u2019s spokeswoman\nhas responded by saying that\nthese women simply want their\n\u201d15 minutes of fame\u201d. Cue me\nfeeling physically ill.\nI\u2019m not sure where the idea\nthat going public with sexual\nassault claims is \u2018a glamorous\nand profitable move\u2019 came\nfrom, but the media coverage\nfrom this week alone should be\nable to kill this misconception.\nThe women who have come\nforward have been ridiculed,\nshamed and openly been\naccused of lying on a national\nstage. One of these women\nhas now said she plans to\nleave the US because she\nfears for her family\u2019s safety.\nAnd, before we all get on\nour high horses this side of\nthe pond, the woman who\naccused Ched Evans has had\nto move five times in the last\nfour years and has now gone\ninto hiding due to online and\nphysical threats to her safety.\nBecause that sounds like fun.\nThe attacks on these women\nhave ranged from Trump\nsaying one woman \u201cwouldn\u2019t\nbe his first choice\u201d (i.e.\nshe\u2019s not attractive enough\nto assault), to one Trump\nsurrogate releasing the phone\nnumber of another accuser.\n\\\\ I\u2019m not sure\nwhere the idea that\ngoing public with\nsexual assault claims\nis a glamorous and\nprofitable move\ncame from \\\\\nFor some people, the fact\nthat none of these women\nspoke out before seems to be\nenough to dismiss these reports\nout of hand, even though one\nof the women has stated that\nthe tapes\u2019 release made her\nrealise that the assault was\nnot her fault for the first time.\nBecause the idea of speaking\nout against a rich, powerful\nman wouldn\u2019t intimidate\nanyone into silence. Because\napparently no one remembers\nthe Bill Cosby case.\nThese arguments are so\nfrustrating that they make me\nwant to scream into a pillow\nbecause the \u201cconversation\u201d\ngoingonrightnowisessentially\nthe lived experience of most\nsexual assault survivors,\nmyself included, blown up to a\ngrand scale.\nLabour must lead\na positive debate\non immigration\nGiacomo Boscaini-Gilroy implores\nthe Labour Party to change public\nperception of immigration\nI\nmperial\u2019s success depends on a\nculture of open-mindedness that has\nattracted academics and students\nto come from abroad, and means\npeople from different cultures, but with\nsimilar interests, can exchange ideas.\nImmigration has allowed this university to\nthrive, so why is it that in Britain today it is\nso universally considered a burden on our\nsociety?\nThe Labour Party is best placed to drive\nthe conversation on immigration to being\na positive one. The Conservatives are only\ndoing the opposite, with home secretary\nAmber Rudd talking about shaming\ncompanies that employ too many foreign\nworkers. However, Labour has tended to\nbe silent on this in recent years because\ntheir support is split between traditional\nworking class communities of the Midlands\nand the North, and progressively-minded\npeople mainly from Southern cities that\nVote Leave branded the \u2018metropolitan\nelite\u2019. One veered overwhelmingly for\nBrexit and the other is strongly pro-Europe, so on the topic of immigration,\nthe two cannot be reconciled. The solution\nhas always been to avoid speaking about\nit loudly, for fear of offending one of the\ntwo sides.\nThe Harambe\neffect: meme over\n(serious) matter\nJonah Beaudin discusses the\ninternet\u2019s propensity for turning\ntragedies into jokes\nThe beginnings are there,\nbut as we have seen before,\nthe party lacks unity and a\nsingle voice. Corbyn\u2019s words\nhave not yet filtered through to\nthe bulk of the electorate, who\nneed to be convinced that\nimmigration can be made to\nwork. In the past, by shoving\nimmigration under the carpet,\nLabour left a space pounced\non by UKIP, who made their\nown views very clear and\nperpetuated xenophobia.\nMany Labour voters\u2019 questions\nabout declining public services\nand purchasing power have\nbeen answered by right-wing\npopulism.\nA debate without vitriol\nmight push us to associate\nforeign faces and accents with\nhard-working labourers and\nhighly-skilled intellectuals who\nwant to come to our country\nbecause it is brimming with\nopportunity. That is how we\nbuild a cohesive society. It\nshould not all be down to\nLabour, but in 2013, as home\nsecretary, Theresa May\nintroduced a divisive billboard\ncampaign telling illegal\nimmigrants to go home. I do\nnot think the party of power\nhas understood that threats\nand marginalisation are the\nlast thing we need.\nT\nhe story about Harambe gained\nglobal attention this summer.\nThen the Cincinnati Zoo wrote\n\u201cWe are not amused by the\nmemes, petitions and signs about\nHarambe.\u201d And that broke the\ninternet. The number of memes created\nskyrocketed. Songs were composed, signs\nwere made, petitions were signed. God\nit was hilarious. But it seems like nobody\nreally cared about the gorilla.\n\u201cDicks Out For Harambe,\u201d isn\u2019t\nempathetic. It\u2019s a joke. The mythical\ncreature of Harambe the Silverback\ngorilla, has grown beyond just a tragic\nincident. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still think\nHarambe memes are hilarious, but the joke\nis very different once one isn\u2019t ignorant\nabout the sequence of events. Watch the\nfootage and make up your own mind if the\nmom should be shot instead of Harambe?\nAs a result, it has been difficult to\nunderstand what the Labour Party\u2019s\nstance is. Shadow Brexit minister Keir\nStarmer called for immigration to be\n\u2018reduced\u2019, but in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour\nconference speech, he started delivering\nthe right message. He spoke out against\nthe demonisation of migrants. He decried\nthe lack of investment in public services\nand housing that has seen immigrants\nbecome the school-place-takers and\ncouncil-house-stealers. We need to hear\npeople advocating the benefits that we\nexperience as Imperial students. We need\nto be shown specific policies like a high\nminimum wage or a robust tax credits\nsystem that can make up for downward\npressure on wages.\n8 Thursday 20 October 2016\nfelix C O M M E N T\nBLAH blah\nblah\nblah BLAH?\n...blah?\nBlah.\n...blah\nBLAH!\nblah..!\nBLAH!!!\nblah?\nBlah!?\n...BLAH!\nblah\nblahblah-blah!\nblah\nblah\nblah\nBlah. Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment fcomment@ic.ac.uk\nIf there is something that this taught\nCincinnati Zoo though, is that you do not\nmess with the internet. What were they\nexpecting? A politely worded apology\nletter from all the h8ers and a gift basket?\nThis is probably why old people shouldn\u2019t\nuse the internet.\nI\u2019m not mad about the Cincinnati Zoo\ndeleting their twitter account (just like\nthey deleted Harambe) but maybe we\nshould reflect more on our own ignorance\nregarding trends such as Trump, Pepe or\neven Harambe.\nUp until writing this article I\u2019d never seen\nthe footage of what happened during the\nHarambe accident. My brief sorrow was\nfollowed by a boatload of\nlaughs. Harambe being shot\nis tragic. And the Harambe\njoke has spread more joy than\ntears on the internet, so is it a\ngood thing?\nFinding the truth in a turmoil\nof nebulous media messages is\ndifficult. Take the US election,\nwhere voters seem to be more\nworried about their candidate\nbeing likeable, rather than\ntheir proposed tax codes or\nforeign policy. You do not\nhave to be a genius to be able\nto undermine Trump as a sexist\nmegalomaniac who wants\nto finally be taken seriously.\nBut sorry Donald, maybe the\nwhite house is not the best\nplace for a billionaire who will\ndo anything for money.\nI enjoy my internet rough\naround the edges. It is the\nonly way it can capture the\nZeitgeist of a joke. However\nreal time self-reflection on\npop-culture is not exactly\nsomething the internet excels\nat. When is one ruining a\njoke, and is one making a\npoint? Hard to say. Especially\nnow with US elections coming\naround it seems like some\nAmericans should wake up\nand stop laughing about the\njoke they created. How would\nDonald even lead the US with\nsuch tiny hands?\n\\\\ The woman who\naccused Ched Evans\nhas had to move five\ntimes in the last four\nyears and has now\ngone into hiding\ndue to online and\nphysical threats \\\\\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say\nsomething sooner?\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure it was him? He\nseems so nice.\u201d\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sure he\u2019s sorry, it\nwas a while ago.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can prove\nanything.\u201d\nThese are the responses I\ngot from friends \u2013 people who\ndidn\u2019t mean badly, but people\nwho live in a culture where the\nfirst response to this type of\nallegation is to assume women\nare lying. This isn\u2019t even\ntaking into account the stigma\nsurrounding male survivors,\nsince even the concept that\nmen can be sexually assaulted\nseems to be far fetched for\nsome people.\nSo, just for the record, here\nare some facts. It\u2019s believed\nthat only between 15-35% of\nsexual assaults get reported.\nCompared to other types of\nviolent crime, false sexual\nassault reports are not more\nlikely to be filed. Men are\nstatistically more likely to\nbe victims of sexual assault\nthan be falsely accused. On\naverage, for every 1000\nreported rape cases, 994\nperpetrators will face no\npunishment.\nThis is less of an opinion\npiece and more of a personal\nplea: when someone tells\nyou they\u2019ve been sexually\nassaulted, please believe\nthem, please tell them it\u2019s not\ntheir fault. I know being a\nsurvivor who hasn\u2019t reported\nis not rare. But the idea that\nI\u2019m not alone is, for once, not\ncomforting \u2013 it\u2019s terrifying.\n\\\\ On average,\nfor every 1000\nreported rape cases,\n994 perpetrators\nwill face no\npunishment \\\\\nStop silencing\nthose who\nspeak out about\nsexual assault\n\\\\ The \u201cconversation\u201d\ngoing on right now is\nessentially the lived\nexperience of most\nsexual assault survivors \\\\\nAnonymous explains why we need\nto treat sexual assault survivors with\nempathy, not suspicion\n\\\\ What were they\nexpecting? A politely\nworded apology from all the\nh8ers and a gift basket? This\nis probably why old people\nshouldn\u2019t use the internet. \\\\\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n404\n- FILE\nN\nO\nT\nFO\nUN\nD\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n\n"
