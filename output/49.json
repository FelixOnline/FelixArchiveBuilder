When 16 he wont to Rolls-Royce as an apprentice taking a first class degree at Derby Tech. in his\n\u2022para time, and being elected a Whitworth scholar.\nAfter he same of age he was put onto flight tests of c, serving with car bure tt or dev elopement as his main interest.\nHa developed one to such an extent that tha engine ground\nto nh \u00bbTt at the crucial moment.

Hia apparatus ia well wet th a visit, being\nthe very opposite of the strong and Bortik research which\nmost of us know. It gleams and the screw heads are cunningly arranged to a et off the pressure gu ages to their best\nadvantage. We do not know whether it works or not but it should be the stock exhibit for distinguished visitors for\nyear* to come.\nIttke has bean in charge of the Gliding Club Transport\nfor the last two years during which he has transformed the\nvery peer material in tea highly eff io i ent unit. One example Is tha stripped-down armoured ear which was parked out-aide the Union about a week ago. He was Captain of the\nGlidiaRiflBb last year and when he can be dragged from the\nworkshop ha flies one of the a all pla a ea.

SMOKING CONCERT When we are old and distinguished we may experience feelings akin to pride on returning to\nCollege to have a look round, and discovering that\nsome of the traditions we founded are still flourishing. Writing as one who vas at the first Booking Concert, I feel that history has already\neast a halo of reverence over my head. I look\nforward to the time when, as I shuffle along the\nembankment, people will make way and whisper, \"He\nWas at the first R.C.S. Smoking Concert.\"\nI wear my mantle of greatness lightly, for I am still young, and besides, I am used to it for I was at the first Harllngton Bonfire as well( and\nat the last one on the Rector's lawn, when strong\nmen wept that an age-old tradition should cer l sh so frivolously). Doubt not Mat the R.C.S. Smoking Concert has\n>e come, like Bonfire Night, Morphy Day and Meld Cup Day a notable occasion in the life of the\nCollege, and if you were here on the last Monday\nof last term you will understand why.\nMost of the turns involved some sort of sing-ling, ranging from the pare notes of the greater\nWardlegales (\"Yoho you drunkards; yoh o you drunk-ard s;y oho, heave ho\") to a charming ballad by\nCol. Lowrey, via all sorts of unmentionable things.\nThere were several sketches including a parody on\n\"what's My Line\", entitled \"Elucidate My Occupat ion\", in which Q.B. Cotton-Thomas caused some\nconsternation by playing golf balls and lumps of\nturf at the audience. A radio play for children,\n\u2022Seduction\", was the most elaborate and the most\nsuccessful turn of the evening, and its life acd \u2022 o ul. Vers Atkinson ( alias Captain Slashlnjug)\ndeserves our congratulations.\nThroughout all these ma ff lc king e the audience\nwas by no means quiet. Beer was being swallowed\nat a Niagara-rate, and there were signs of rowdyism that would have been out of place almost anywhere except in a Smoking Concert. Thus, lt came\nas a surprise, at the height of the h ll ari^us nee a, to see Bon Macfie march on to the platform, a recorder clutched firmly in his hand, and deliver himself of a delightful period work, which went on\nfor several minutes in a gym that was otherwise\ncompletely silent. Whether lt was surprise or\nsheer rapture which did the trick I know not, but\nLion Tamer Daniel has nothing on our Bon. Pete\nLIley attempted a similar \"tour\" a little later, but the boys were awake again by then. S*H \u00bb>\n. PH CE N1X Before embarking upon this review it is really necessary to elucidate the question of criticism with respect to Phoenix. The normal course of affairs appears to be this: a member\nof the college feels that he does not want to buy\nPhoenix because it lacks a sufficient standard of literary attainment; he is asked, when he begins to criticize articles, why he does not personally try to improve it ani the matter rests there. This reviewer has never written anything for Phoenix( principally because he has never had any-)\nthing suitable to write) and is never likely to, but he will nevertheless attempt an objective> criticism. For the first part, there is far too much\nmaterial that should not be in a magazine.\nAdmittedly some mention of the future of I.C. is useful, but two pages of it is rather much.\nThis' future' is essentially news. News should be In a newspaper and the college has one.\nSimilar remarks apply to the relatively gargantuan article on th a athletic clubs. Though most do not have to read it if they have\nno wish to, when reviewing Phoenix one has to read all of it. There should atleast be some\npity for this person. Possibly the reviewer i a biased, but the facts have appeared in ex ten sun on the back page of Felix. And yet again the Commemoration Bay address though it has to be admitted that soma place has\nto be found for a permanent record of thi a speech. The editorial to the Review of the Michaelmas term appeared to have been written rather from a sense of duty than as a piece of literature, but fortunately some of the contents helped to make\nup for this. The play review made goad and\ninteresting reading, the writer knew hi a job, ana\nwhat is important, a little of the history of the play and the art of acting., And now'what of the articles? Fortunately, th\u00abre is only one bn the. administration of the kc il lega and only am obvious space filler which 'mast be put on-mp \u00abP with articles like \u2022 Writing for Phoenix\". \"Sponsored T.V.* and the\" Marriage of Manuela* are both, reasonable but Hack much. IB s the \" Marriage\" one feels that the author has\nwritten in that style for the sake of it and it is difficult to see Just what he is trying to accomplish.^ \"The Forbidden Knowledge\" \" requires more than one reading, to comprehend. It is on an\nimportant subject and even if somewhat ' bourgeois realist' is logical and well written. Whether\nit is appreciated is purely a personal question and it is best to allow it to speak for itself. The reviewer feels strongly on the subject of the poetry in Phoenix. Without having room\nin this article to justify my opinions, I feel t that the only poetry worth considering in Phoenix is contained in \"To Write a Sonnet\". The poets of this college cannot write in a modern style. Accomplished modern poets can\nalso write i a an old style, and to do this is indeed difficult. In conclusion. No - not a very satisfying\" Phoenix, and until more students write better articles and news is cut out it never will be a satisfying Phoenix. Hugh **- Gr igg.

    "content": "FELIX\n\"MOULIN ROUGE\" CARLTON CINEMA\nIt is somehow mistaken to consider the work\nof Toulouse Lautrec caricature, though viewing it from the point of view of one who has not known\ndespair or lived in the dregs of society it would teem to he ouch yet it is certainly not naturalistic. No, what he really does is to deviate from nature to express things deep-seated\nthat the caricaturist does not set out to represent, for though the paintings depict the broad characteristics of his subjects, they also tell us\nhow these subjects felt and what they suffered in their hectic, sometimes desperate lives. It is the task of the film to translate the paintings back to real life, for in this way the characters may be shown in their true outward form and also express their happiness es and despairs in words and actions, things which canvas cannot do.\n\" Moulin Rouge\" succeeds in this translation very well, especially in that many of the scenes remind us with startling effect of the paintings we know\nso well and of the sorrow we expected The few opening sequences serve to impress\nthe background of events that formed the genius of Toulouse Lautrec. How in his boyhood he suffered an accident and was permanently stunted, a deformity which led him to leave home and come to Paris for the purpose of painting. How the Moulin Rouge\nnightclub was his inspiration to depict( in his own words of the film)\" the gutter\". In fact the impression is gained that if it were not for the accident and the existence of the nightclub we\nshould not have had such paintings at all, but\nthat he would have grown up to be an idle count\nlike his father. After depicting the background, the film is devoted to expressing the life and character of the\npainter himself. His life in Paris, before he\ndied, was a short one and consequently his nature was reasonably constant throughout, that of a man\ndrinking to drown his misery and pain from his legs, despairing pr act io ally to suicide, and always\npainting, nain ting to give himself a reason to live.3\" os e. Ferrer's acc ing seems at times almost restrained, but then in real life we do not act like the characters on an operatic stage, and\nhaving been brought up as the son of an aristocrat one would not expect Toulouse Lautrec to give way\nto violent emotions at every eventuality. Nevertheless when lose' Ferrers its with an apparently impassive face we can feel, by some strange sympathy\nwhat he is feeling, which is surely a greater acting than the technique of \"sawing the air\". I would be extremely surprised if anyone came\naway from this film without the desire to be an\nartist of some kind, and above all without having an understanding for the emotional problems of this artist atleast. This is by nc means a film where we identify ourselves with the hero, one\ncannot desire to associate oneself with his despairs and vicissitudes, but rather one where we\nare stimulated to do as he does and make something\nof value of our lives.

Vv'ode house a this best. It is about three happy go lucky thieves, with their repertoire of\" techniques\", who nak e Vichy their hunting ground. Complication a naturally arise, it being spring: matters are\nnot made any easier by the presence of Lady Hur f \u2022\nwho has her own ideas about fun, and the play moves gaily from scene to scene, keeping us all thoroughly amused.\nThe three thieves were .eet erbo no(.^ arp h Benn ett) the veteran, Hector( Charles Dickerman) the\nlady killer with an American accent and Gustave\nthe baby of the party. Gustave was played extremely well, naive, sensitive and inexperienced by Neil Blackmore. To back him up was Valerie Stacey as Eva. These two dominated the play for along time. Jean Osborne ( Lady hur f) and\nBarbara Harris( Juliette). both old hands of the\nDramatic Society, were equally competent in their smaller parts. David Adams as the r/ usi-ci an said little but provided important back-ground.\n- Speaking of background, the sets in the\nfirst act the garden should have been much\nbetter.

A feature that caught the eye was the\nnursemaid policeman mime in the first act. Some more mine could have been effectively used in the last two acts. The Dramatic Society this year con cent ra ted on light plays for some reason best known\nto themselves: \"The Inca of Peru salem\" was a caricature, and \"The Jealous Wife\" and \" Thieves' Carnival\" were both very funny. Though humorous plays are more pleasant and possibly more\neasy to produce, something more serious might\nhave been attempted. The Dramatic Society has\nin the past tackled such plays as \" Ascent ofF.6\" and \"Thunder Rock\", and tackled them well. There is no reason why they should not attempt something similar next time. rogues' carnival. \"GOLD RUSH\"\nThe Mi nes Carnival, on March 20th, was certainly one*\nof the beat.

DEBATES 'Tnat Science t Technology do nt constitute University\n. e duct ion in its fullest sense\" was debated in the Oya on\nThursday, 4th. Two m the no.t ici an s were the proposer and\noppose r, and stated the irc ses fairly or ec is ol. Frofescor Semple of Kina'c proposed tha np tic n lie\nstarted by pointing out that science is only one field of\nhu.ian knowledge; and anyone concentrating on science and\ntechnology loses touch with the other'field a of knowledge.\nKe thinks only of concrete thi.ncr s, and looe sli is; se ioe of '\nvalues which is so essential to full education. He gave\nas an example his own stay at Cambridge, where students of\nall faculties lived, ate and talked -together; e. nd how he\nwas far more interested in and instructed by his friends\nfrom the arts side than from the science side. Replying\nto people who quoted the Industrial Revolution as their\nargument, he said that it was started by scientific advances,\nand brought on many evils such as child labour. It was\nnot until people - non-scientists - insisted that such\nconditions cannot go on that an improvement was brought\n' abou j? The so i ent is t today has the means of producing\nenormous power.. But he has no control over it. Today\nmore than ever, he should have the judgment to see that\nhis labours are not put to dangerous use. The scientist\nmust develop his sense of values, and ha cannot do this by\nlearning only science and technology. He therefore is not fully educated.\nProfessor Levy opposed. There is no reason, he said,\nwhy a scientist should not have knowledge of as wide a variety of subjects as any other person. A really\ndeep scientific study of any object - Professor Levy's pipe for example - will need knowledge of a considerable\nnumber of other things. Science, taught properly, will\nalso teach the student to think of thine s like the men who\nmade the oi pe, the country from which its wood came, and so\non. A science student carries out an experiment, ana gets\nsome results. He then proceeds to general is e the result,\neven as we identify ourselves with a character in a novel.\nHis generalization is true only over a certain rai ge. To\ndetermine that range, he needs judgement and a sense o tr values.\nA scientist, fur the more. seeks only truth, in fact he dare\nnot tell a lie: and truth is a value. The fully educated\n; man is one whose pattern of knowledge and pattern el values\nfit together. A person cannot be a scientist unless he\niB human in the first place; scientists and humans 8rS* not\ntwo different races. The senses of value and judgment\ndeveloped in the laboratory are applied in the world because\ntheir holder is the same person, whether he is in v idea laboratory or outside it. A or oo ert rsl n inK in science and\nte cnn ology^ does therefore moan a full education.\nMr. A. Peacock, supporting, pointed out how an average'\nscience student comes to his lectures and goes back from\nthem too tired for anything else, thus losing all to u oh with\nother things. Scientists in big firms were always in the\nback\" rooms, not in the Board rooms, for they cannot express\nthemselves. The leaders were politicians who.after all, are only people who1 can-speak well.\nMr. Just said th st it depends entirely on the student\nwhether he is full v educated or not. In(London in particular,\none can satisfy any interest or curiosity one nay have. ^\nThe three years of intensive training in one field w mm essential in anyone who wanted to find a DrotfeT place in the\nworld.\nSpeeches from the floor wert j, mainly in opposition to\nthe motion. It was pointed out that scientists were in\n:\nthe Board rooms in other countries, & that UKJ has far sore\nofficers from the sci eno e side than from the arts. The v otiS k was seven for, sixteen against, four abstentions. Many\npeople had left before the debate finished, for it was getting\nlate. The time, 5.15 p.m., was obviously not suited to\nia number of people who were probably too tired for anything\niB lse after their lectures and lab. work. Nevertheless,\nProfessor Levy is understood to have remarked that th\u00ab\ni floor speeches were of.'4a* highest standard he had ever heard.\n^^THIS^EVENIM&i UL Debate Finals., Kings vs. Wye C^ie ge\"._.

However, they did a good job.\nOur first success was on 5th May when W. Robartson won the\ntwo miles Steeplechase, after overtaking D.

Our correspondent, Shylock Groans, has a tale to tell.'1 As\"s boh~ as T saw'the fool i prints'^ realised that\" those abominable showmen the 29 Club had struck again.\nMy suspicions were confirmed on finding a cardboard\nstencil, cut in'the shape of a foot, in the notice board frame outside the door of the Union, for the number 29 was written on it. Following *Che footprints, I discovered that they led through the Beit Arch, across\na corner of the tennis court (without impediment by the\nwire netting) down into the Botany basement, and up the\nvertical wall of the Union, over the roof, down again,\nup and on to the road by Queen Alexandra's House.\n\"Readers may remember that the 29 Club specialize in painting and decorating. They made headlines in FELIX\nlast term when we reported how, at the end of the Autumn\nTerm, they handle-barred the stuffing in the lower dining\nhall, and painted the lights on the Albert Steps. One\nsuspects that they are a rare form of lunatics operating\nonly at term ends.\"\nThe FELIX reporter who deals with 29 Club activities would like to scotch any rumours that on account of this strenuous, publicity campaign for the Club, he has been\nelected to honorary membership. He consequently has no\ninside information, and would welcome any that may be\navailable. Archeologists and others may note that traces of the imprints are still visible on the wall of the Union\nfacing the Albert Hall, where they have been exciting considerable speculation among' music lovers and boxing\nfans.\nLADIES. I.C. W.S.C. returned triumphant from the University\nAthletic Championships on May 9th. with two cups, the\nImperial College Challenge Cup and the Sherwood Cup.Tiis\nlatter cup is awarded on a proportional basis, the number of points awarded to a team being divided by the\nnumber in the college.\nUnder the captaincy of Janet Findlater the I.C. team\nperformed extremely well. The field events'competitors,\non form after their efforts under the supervision of\ncoach Margaret Evenett, produced some creditable results,\nin spite of having to practice on the Rector's Lawn. In\nthe track even taJ. Findlater was the star for I.C., but\nI.C. W.S.C. are to be congratulated on putting up such a Stirling performance.\nMore sport on page 6.\nJ. Findlater ( left) and J.B.

Circulation: 1200.\nIn this issue there appears information about two conferences to be held this summer.Ono of them is clearly ent it led 'Peace' and the other, the author of the letter in forms us, concerns peace without the inverted commas. ( It, is in fact a festival, not a conference in the strictest\nsense.) Both are good examples of seriously planned, well organised events which invite all interested students to participate in them. Bodies of students in I.C. are ready\nto support them, and are asking all others to do the same.\n/ Now it is usual for I.C. clubs and Societies to send\ndelegates to the relevant meetings, for those bodies are\nrecognised representatives of that particular activity in I.C. But for conferences of a wider nature, those that concern the student body as a whole and not any particular\nactivity, no delegation should be labelled as that of I.C. without the official support of the Union. Beyond a def i nite detachment from the I.U.S., their Congresses(the one\nthi a year is being held in Warsaw) and other activities, there seems to be no fixed policy in these matters. Not\nthat it is a simple matter, for no one o an foretell who\nif going to organise something and-invite students' sup-port.

Seven Kinp;s9103. VIEWPOINT' DOWN WITH FELIX? There have been several U.L. newspapers before, and\nthe last one, \" University\" packed up two years ago, after running for a year on meagre support. It never sold\nwell in I.C.; it was poor^competition for FELIX. This\nraises a fundamental problem, as far as the proposed\npublication is concerned. FELIX provides I.C. with most\nof the University news that its readers want to know,\nbut it cannot be denied that there are large gaps in matters which most of our people never hear about. The\ngoings-on at Senate House seldom reach us except via the\nofficial notice-boards, which are not often scanned.\nIn these matters, and in others, a University newspaper\nmight help us. In particular, Sport.\nThe present plan for the new paper is that it shall appear weekly, and will probably be sold a t2d. It will be newsprint, starting with eight pages about \"Evening\nStandard\" size. It will have staff in all the colleges of the University, and a paid assistant at a central office in Woburn Square, or thereabouts.\nThis is a large conception; but it is no larger than many which have become outstandingly successful, notably the Cambridge newspaper \" Varsity\". But \"Varsity1\n'\nhas a tremendous advantage; it does not have to compete\nwith individual college newspapers. This is where the\nPlan comes in. FELIX must finish. Inline with the other college newspapers of U.L. he must Tiake way gracefully for a greater cause. We have seen in the past that a Univ ers it y newspaper has no chance against a home product\ncontaining the cream of our own news. If the information now printed fortnightly by FELIX appeared weekly in a far more sophisticated publication, surely we would be\nsatisfied. Why not keep FELIX and buy the other as well? We\nknow from the past that the contents of the other would\nsuffer, because of the claims of FELIX on our writers, and we would not buy the University newspaper is large numbers. And a newspaper of the contemplated size and\nscope is only practicable with a circulation not smaller\nthan five thousand - the total circulation of the current\ncollege newspapers.\nWe must obviously act in step with the othe colleges, if we act at all: it would be pointless for FELIX to pack up if\"Pi\", \"Kings News\" and \"Beaver\" still flourish ed, especially since we are alone in not running at a loss. There are big objections to my plan. It may be\nthat, deprived of the responsibility of producing a comp let e newspaper, the I.C. correspondents of the new\npap\u00ab\u00a3 would lose interest and become unwilling collectors of un enthusiastically written news. Also, if FELIX\nceased publication and the U.L. paper failed we would be\nin a Bess.\nThese and other problems need debating and clarify ing. But they should be considered seriously in the\nlight of a concrete proposal for the resurrection of the\nUniversity newspaper. I suggest, with the kind permission of the Editor, that you should make known to FELIX\nyour views on the matter. If there appears to be support for the plan, I propose to run a survey to invest i gate the true feeling in I. C.<^^._lf>^) DANC i NG IO-6A.M.
