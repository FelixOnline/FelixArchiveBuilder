Aristotle based his political philosophy\nlargely upon his work on ethics; this attitude towards politics is nowadays generally\nignored as being irrelevant in the \" real wor -Id\" . This could well ex plain why the co un \u2022\ntry is in such a sorry political state ; the\npresent situation does not even conform to\nMachiavelli' s principle since no body has\nany very clear aims in mind . Whi le I do not\ngo so far as some historians in suggesting\nthat the lack of ethics in modern politics is\ndue entirely to the influence of Lloyd George, there is no room to doubt that he was\ncompletely without ethics.\nThis does not detract from his social achievements which make him one of our foremost social reformers; but it is to be remembered that no one man, and especially a po-lit ici an, can devise a social policy. In the\nlate 19th and early 20th centuries there were\nmany liberal social philosophers who suggested social reforms which they considered\nwere required to improve society. Lloyd\nGeorge merely put this previous work into\npractice. To do this he had to use highly\nquestionable methods such as threatening\nto create enough liberal peers to pass the\nnecessary legislation through the Lords. This contempt of established institutions\napplied not only to those questionable ones\nlike the House of Lords but to others, less\ncontroversial, and ultimately the liberal party itself. The very fact that Lloyd George\nobtained so much power before he did anything useful is an indication of his nature.\nThe policies which put him into office were\nreflections of previous liberal work; once in\noffice, as chancellor, he used his position\nto obtain even greater power, becoming at\nthe outset of war, minister of munitions and\nfinally prime minister. The use of mani pula; tion and oratory, in both of which he excel-led, to augment his power without any very\nprecise policy, apart from the vague statement 'to win the war', is an example of the\nunethical a a ture of politics which he helped\nintroduce into this country and which has\npersisted ever since. One cannot imagine hm\nFILM REVIEW 'ASHANTT\nMichael Caine in 'Ashanti'\nThe N UP E demonstration succeeded in\nmaking me late for the Press Show of \" Ashanti\"( A A, Leicester Sq . Odeon). This\ncomes hot of the tail of \" Capricorn One\" in that it claims to be even more exciting\nand important as it could well be based a round the unthinkable. On this occasion it\nis the existence of a present-day slave\ntrade from West Africa to the land of Persian\nKings. Michael Caine, playing a Doctor\nworking for the WHO, is on the trail of his\nabducted wife. Through the tropical forests\nand desert, Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) is shadowed until the eventual climax. Privately\nfunded, and directed by Richard Fleischer\nthe objectionable fact of this film is that it\nis as exploit ive of the negros as the action\nit portrays. It reminded me so much of the\ndespicable 'Slavers' of a few months back.\nFilm makers themselves, see the African as\nnothing more than sex objects and merchants\nof black magic, giving them no character\nand no human responses. Secondly, in this\npresent day, cinema high adventure unfortunately always seems to mean gra dui to us violence and scenes of sickness. Next week\nI hope to review \" Magic\"( X, Odeon HaymaF\nket) directed by Richard Attenborough.\nRoger Stotesbury\nEds note -this article was originally entitled \"Getting Down and getting on.\"\nSorry, Roger.\nbehaving as his great predecessor Gladstone <\nwhen the latter, forced to use official mail\nfor a private letter, had later torn up a stamp.\nLloyd George ultimately destroyed the\nliberal party when he attempted to extend the\nwar time coalition beyond the end of the war\nand thus perpetuate his own government. He alienated half of his party which refused to\nsupport the government; he did not mend the\nbreach, an in d cation that he did not care\nabout the fate of his own party. Thus when\nthe conservatives left him, he had no means\nto continue governing since there was no\nlonger any united liberal party. And soon\nthere would hardly be any liberal party in\nthe face of the rising labour party'. The Greek Fatalists maintained that whatsoever a man loved most would ultimately destroy\nhim; Lloyd George's career is a splendid\nexemplification of this ironical attitude.\nTherefore the tendency of those recent\nhistorians to praise Lloyd George, or at\nleast ignore his lack of ethics - are doing a great dis-service to the liberal party; he was\na liberal only in name, but a power seeker\nin practice.\nA recent example of this form of hag io graph y is John Grigg's\" Lloyd George\" The\nPeople's Champion 1902-1911.\nFrank James\nTable Tennis\nI.C. IV vI.C. Ill (6 -3) !!!\nYes, they finally did it - the fourths proved, (beyond all doubt),\nthat their victory over the thirds in the first match of the season was\nnot a fluke, by winning again.\nAmazing performances by Rutherford (it's that man again), LamACC Alive and Well\nTo the masses s This is to certify that the Athletic Club s Committee actually\nexists and does perform certain functions for I.C.U. The reason for me (the chair thing) to inform all of you about\n(this is because certain rumours have reached my wonderful ears\nthat A.C.C. does not exist. The rumours started when all references\nbert and Cobrin (and less amazing performances by the thirds - Reeds,to the A.C.C. disappear d from official I.C.U. handouts (was it that\nStean, Ansah) produced this form-book upset, putting the fourths\nclear of the thirds and in a good 2nd place in div. 6 . (I was fortunate to have been dropped for this match !)\nI.C. II v N.C. B. Ill (8-1) (away)\nIan Reed, (of 3rd team fame - see above) played earlier for the\nseconds and won all three of his games! Marlin however (2nd team\ncapt.) did not and Tye won three yet again.\nI.C. IV v Gainsford VI (2-7) (Home)\nThis was a top-of-the-table clash of gargantuan proportions (I wish I could stop this drivel!) which the fourths lost valiantly -Rutherford won the two games (we will have to drop him - he's winning too many matches) but they were all closely contested. Finally\nI discovered that the firsts beat Davies, Laing and Dick two weeks\nago by 7 games to 2, but lost by the same margin to B.S.C.33 Club I last week. This was a disappointing result after the recent good\nrun the firsts were having.\nAnd another \" finally\", I hope anyone daft enough to read the\nreport had as much fun this weekend as I did. Superhewk (Physics II and bar-Union, that is).\n'yacht club' had pushed Mary A. too far and that I.C.U. exec, planned to purge the A.C.C. from their ranks?). The original rumours\nthat something was wrong were greatly enhanced by the fact that, at\nthe last A.C.C. general meeting, none of the gathered captains, were\nseen to move or heard to say anything for over an hour. However,\nthis fact should be totally ignored on the grounds that this is the\nnatural state of most of them and the rest were silenced by two of\nthe A.C.C. exec, who insisted on communicating with one and other\nby barking (as in \"woof! woof !).\nThe A.C.C. exec, now have so many positive waves that they will survive all attempts by I.C.U. exec, to ignore us in the blatant hope\nthat we will simply go away.\nI hope to inform you presently what the function of A.C.C. is, but\nif you are dying to set up a sports club that ICU doesn't already\nhave (we do have a ten pin bowling club) or you want to know anything about the sports clubs I.C.U. or U.L. U. have then please' find\nme in the Union Office any lunchtime and ask away. Love, Clyde\nPS: actual name not given in case Mike Elk in manages to spell it\nright when he sends me his wie rd love letters.\n\n"

Acre t of the fact that I think society very admirable state of affairs\nis repressive towards women, and\nas such am prepared to do something about it. It would be nice if\nmen and women could work together to eliminate discrimination\nand repression wherever it exists\nwith regard to both sex and race.\nThis will never come about, how-ever, if groups such as WIST (Wo-men in Science and Technology)\ncontinue to operate in what can\nonly be described as an antagonistic fashion. Waging a 'sex-war'\ncan only be counter-productive.\nTheir ludicrous claim that only\nwomen can understand how women\nare repressed can do nothing to\nchange men's attitudes - rather it\nserves to strengthen them.\n\"Women only\" meetings (such\nas last week's WIST meeting) are\nto be condemned as discriminatory just as \"men only\" events\ncertainly do not inspire others\n(both men and women) with sympathy or understanding.\nPeople should campaign against sexism as individuals - be ca us in the end it is the individual\nwhich I hope will continue for a very long time.\nYours, In increasing fear of loosing my right of freedom of choice\nand expression,\nAndrew Lyall\nSir, - At the risk of provoking yet\nfurther response on the topic, I feel compelled to answer the\nletter in last week's FELIX from\nMary Attenborough.\nAs the organiser of this year's FELIX Dinner, I chose the particular venue for a number of rea-sons. Firstly, the Dinner was to\nbe held outside College; I felt it\ntime that the traditional stranglehold that the College Refectory\nservice has over such functions\nshould be broken, thereby offering\nthe diners the possibility of\ndecent food and reasonable cost.\nSecondly, I tried to find a venue that had some link with the\nnewspaper industry; Fleet Street\nis the obvious location, and El Vino the company which immediately springs to mind.\nBy attending the Dinner, one\n(either man or woman) who will be In o more registers a vote in favour\nof the political opinions of the\nmanagement then one would show\nsupport of, for example, Victor\nMooney's by eating in the College\nRefectories or the knickers in the\nUnion Bar by drinking there.

Yours faithfully,\n.hh n Shuttleworth\nMaths II\nEds note - In response to this and\nother requests that departments\nreceive more copies, from the\nmessengers particularly, for a trial period the print run of FELIX\nwill be increased from 30CX J to\n4<>W \u201e\nbetter off when sexism no longer\npervades our society.\nThe sooner people like Mary\nAttenborough and Sonia Hochfelder realise this, then the sooner we shall be some way to achieving that objective.\nYours anti-disc rim in a tori ly, Sheyne Lucock\nDear Editor, - In common, I guess,\nwith most readers of FELIX I noticed with considerable irritation\nthe seemingly petty letter from\nMs. Attenborough concerning the\n' El Vino' restaurant in last week's FELIX. However on second\nthoughts I realised that this let ta represented a far more serious\nmatter than it at first seemed to,\nit in fact represents a direct attack on the freedom of the individual in this case the owner/\nmanagement of ' El Vino' by a frighteningly large minority within society today.\nThis group of people in their\nfanatical devotion to the impossible and perhaps undesirable aim\nof absolute equality (after all, are not the people of Democratic\nCampouchia more 'equal' than the\npeople of U.K. and how many\nBritains could honestly say that\nthey would rather live in Campouchia?) are prepared to sacrifice\nthe freedom of choice of the individual which exists in this country today making it the best country in the world to live in Can interesting point to note is that Britain was the only country that\nwould allow Karl Marx to live and\nwork in it). Any \u00b0 new no disputes\nthis may leave the country and go\nanywhere they care to go, a choice which very few people in\nthe world today are lucky enough\nto have.\nDear Editor, - My letter is particularly addressed u> those male\nchau veni st boars who inhabit\nCA G.

There also\nseems to be a large proportion of\nmen who totally ignore the women,\nwhile harping on about I.F. and\nother girls - perhaps they don't realise how much it can hurt those\ngirls who are shy, sensitive and\nlonely. At the moment, all I could\nsay to a prospective woman student engineer is - learn from my\nmistake and go elsewhere.

This part-i cula ril yun savoury incident occured about 10.30 pm and took the\nj form of peeping under the door of\ni an occupied cubicle. The girl\n[concerned was unable to raise the\nrape alarm as it was safest to re-i main inside the cubicle. Having\nI sworn at the peeper who then seem-i ed to go away, the girl waited unt il she heard other footsteps\nbefore leaving the toilets. A search of the Union Building a few\nminutes later proved fruitless.\n1\nWhether the man (described as\nnegroid, with chubby features)\nwas contemplating rape, or was\nmerely getting some kicks in a rather sick way is irrelevant -this type of incident is extremely unnerving for any girl. I would\nhope that it was not a member of\nImperial College Union who was\nthe per per tr at or of the incident.\nAttacks on women and girls using\nj the East staircase toilets have\nbeen occurring at the rate of three\nor four a year for the last four\nyears. Although two rape alarm\nbuttons have been installed in\nthose toilets, they are not inside\nthe cubicles and are situated at\nshoulder level and as such are\neasily set off accidentally. Perhaps it would be worthwhile for\nthe Union to install buttons in all the cubicles and at such\na height that they are easily accessible in an emergency, but not\nprone to accidental triggering?\nFurthermore, perhaps the College Security Officer, Mr. Dawson,\ncould give some indication of how\nhe thinks would-be attackers from\noutside the College can be discouraged from even entering the\nUnion Building.\nIn an article in FELIX No.504, Sheyne Lu cock referred to the\nReclaim the Night Campaign\nwhich is at tem t ping to make the\nstreets safe for women to walk on\ntheir own at night. A very commendable ideal indeed. However when\neven our own campus is obviously not a safe place for women to\nbe, I feel that something more\ntangible in the short term is\nrequired. Perhaps more effective\ndeterrents and some increased\nsecurity are small steps in the\nright direction? .\nYours etc..\nDavid Crabbe\nDear John, -I must write and comment on the article about I.C. Radio in today's edition of the I.C. Liberal Club newspaper 'Forward'.\nThe article, by an un-named au th or, is not only misinformed, but\nalso damaging both to me personally and the station.\nTo answer some of the specific\npoints:\nThere has never been any deal\nbetween I.C. Radio and the Nat.\nWest. Bank. I had discussed the\npossibility of a small donation in\nthe order of \u00a3100 with one of\ntheir staff; this could not lead to\nadvertising on the station as our\nHome Office licence does not permit outside commercials.\nAs far as reception is concern-ed, in the past four College weeks\nthere have been five major chan\n-ges to the transmission system\nto try and improve reception, with\nconsiderable success. However\nany changes that we make have to be within limits set by the\nHome Office which does not give\nus much scope for manoeuvre.\nWhen a radio station increases\nits broadcasting from 35 to 60\nhours a week, and changes its\nformat away from 'juke box mu zak' it is inevitable that more staff\nare required, certainly our staff\nturnover is no greater than in many union organizations, less than\nin most. To answer the other two\npoints briefly. I certainly do expect news to be heard on I. C.R a dio before it appears in FELIX( radio is an immediate medium,\npublishing a newspaper has an\ninevitable delay) and as far as a successor is concerned there are\na number of student stations in\nthe U.K. which change their (un-der graduate) station managers\nevery year. (Many of them broadcast for double the hours of I.C. Radio). If Liberal Club have evidence that it is not possible here,\nperhaps they should present their\nevidence.\nI hope that after reading the\nabove, members of the Liberal Club (particularly the author of\nthe article who didn't have the\nguts to give his or her name) will find themselves able to issue a public apology for the article to\nboth myself and our loyal staff.\nOtherwise I am considering taking action on two of the points\nin it, as my legal advice suggests\nthat the article has libelled both\nmyself and the station.\nYours Sincerely,\nJohn Allen\nStation Manager, I.C. Radio\n\n"

    "content": "|Page v) Welfare Day and Sex\nOn Wednesday, amongst all the other things you can find out more\nabout, are contraception and abortion. The Family Planning Association will be there as well as British Pregnancy Advisory Service.\nContraception\nA normally fertile woman having regular sexual intercourse with\na normally fertile man stands about a60% chance of getting pregnant in anyone month. So if you don't want to have kids its a good\nidea to use some safe, effective contraception.\nThere are various methods that can be used.\n1. Condom - (rumoured to be a very effective form of contraception\nas it puts most people off the whole idea), is a rubber sheath placed\nover an erect penis in order to stop semen from entering the vagina. Theoretically the condom should be about 97% effective, i.e.3 women out of 100 becoming pregnant in any one year. However, the\nactual figure is only 8 0 % effective, (arising from people who may\nclaim to use this method failing to use it or not using it properly).\nTheir effectiveness is increased to 9 8 % (theoretical) and 9 5 % (in\npractice) if used in conjunction with a spermicide.\nThe great advantage of condoms is that they are available without\ngoing for medical advice. Lots of loos have dispensing machines in\nthem (e.g. the Ladies Lop in the union building) or they can be ob-tai ned, without prescription, from a chemist.\n2. Spermicides\nIt is not advisable to use these on their own as they are not particularly effective. They are used in conjunction with a condom (see\n1) or cap (see 3).\nSpermicides act in two ways: by killing sperm and by creating a barrier of foam or fluid through which sperm cannot pass into the\nuterus.\nThere are lots of different types of spermicides, creams, jellies and aerosols. Some women may find that they irritate their genitals.\n3. Caps\nThe most used type of cap is the diaphragm. Caps fit across a wo marf s cervix (entrance to the uterus). It has to be fitted initially\nby a doctor or nurse as it needs to be the right size for the in divi dual woman.\nThe cap is placed in position not more than 2 hours before intercourse and left in place for at least 8 hrs afterwards and in order to\nbe at all effective has to be used in conjunction with spermicide.\nUsed in conjunction with spermicide it is theoretically 97% effective but only 75% in practice.\nThe cap and condom are particularly useful if you are not getting\nit regularly but on a more regular basis could become a bit of a drag.\nFor this reason I.U.D.'s( coils or loops) and pills are favoured by\nlots of younger women, though they have drawbacks in relation to the\npossible side-effects.\n4. The I. U.C.( coil or loop)\nIntrauterine device (which I shall call a coil from now on) is fitted\nby a trained person, and can remain in place for 2-3 years. Copper 7\n(and the similar Copper T) are the most common to be fitted to\nwomen who have not had children.\nIt is not exactly known how coils work and they are only effective\nwhile in place, (they may fall out during menstruation). Their other\ndraw-back is that they can give severe discomfort just after fitting\nand also increase menstrual loss (with accompanied greater pain).\nThey are about 9 5 % effective.\n5. The Pill The most widely used type of pill is the combination pill i.e. containing o estrogen and progesterone. On the fifth day after menstruation a woman begins to take the pill then once a day for 21 days\nthen has 7 days free, then starts all over again.\nThis pill works by preventing ovulation, by affecting the uterus\nlining so that in plantation could not occur and by causing cervical mucus to thicken, forming a barrier to sperm.\nThe main disadvantages are that remembering to take it can\nbecome a neurotic obsession. There are lots of side effects e.g. headaches, nausea, swollen or tender breasts, vaginal discharges,\ndepression, and risk of blood clotting. The combined pill is theoretically 99% effective (though only\n95% in practice).\nThe continuous pill contains progesterone only, is taken all the\ntime and also has some interesting side effects but risks should\nbe less as it contains no o estrogen. It is about 96% effective.\n(90% in practice).\nOther methods\nAre not very effective, (except sterilisation.) The method is\nselected a bst in ance based on the fact that ovulation takes place\nat about 14 days after the beginning of menstruation, but in practice is even less effective than withdrawal.\nWhere to get it\nContraceptives are free to all women and can be obtained from\n1. Most doctors (on prescription) including the college health\ncentre who are only too pleased to help.\n2. The Family Planning Association. Despite the title you don't have to be. married. The nearest branch is in Holland Street, W.8 open on Tuesdays and Wednesdays 5.30 - 7 . 3 0 . (937 4385)\n3. Brook Advisory Clinic.233 Totterham Ct. Road, W.1(3231522) Specialises in the young and generally unmarried though anyone\ncan go.\n4 . Condoms can be bought from chemists or from machines in Loos.( Unfortunately men cannot get them free from Birth Control clinics). Other ways of avoiding pregnancy are abstaining or less extremely having homosexual or lesbian relationships. These, of course,\nhave their own problems. Welfare Day can still help as the Campaign\nfor Homosexual Equality will be there to talk about Gay Rights. Abortion\nThere are lots of different types of abortion. Abortion is generally\nsafer than continuing a pregnancy and childbirth.\nThe most common method of abortion is carried out between 7-12\nweeks and is by suction (properly called Dilation and Evacuation\nor D HE). The foetus is removed by suction through a narrow tube\ninserted through the cervix. The abortion takes about 10 mins and can be done in a outpatient\nclinic. Where to go\nYour doctor may refer you for an abortion on the National Health. If not, do not despair there are two charities in London.\n1. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service. 58 Petty France,\nVictoria S.W.1(2220985)2. Pregnancy Advisory Service 43 Margeret St., W1*(409 0 281)\nBoth do cheap pregnancy testing (about \u00a32) and can arrange abortions for about \u00a360 or less.( They also have a good counselling service).\nGrowing up\nAlso for your delight and enjoyment the controversial film 'Growing\nUp\" will be shown on Wednesday Afternoon.\nThe film \" Growing Up\" has a fifteen second sequence of intercourse and scenes of a woman and a boy master bating. Before you say that this seems harmless enough I must warn you\nof a few comments made by my mentor Mary Whitehouse. Bearing\nin mind of course that \" Sexual anarchy is the forerunner of polit i cal anarchy\". She quotes an individual called Mary Miles( supposed-ly an eminent education a list and psychotherapist) who says that\n\" the whole question of group education about sex is open to. doubt\"\nand goes on to say that \" Dr. Cole's film may well reassure a dole scents that masturbation is not harmful physically, but it does not\nand cannot touch the deeper and more important point, that the\nfantasies contained in masturbation vary widely, and it is these\nthat cause anxiety and guilt. In some people masturbation is compulsive and unsatisfying, in some girls and women it can be related\nto their unresolved conflict over not having a penis\". So now you know! Information on contraception etc. taken from\n\" A Womens Body-an owners Manual\" Quotes from Mary Whitehouse\nfrom \"Whatever happened to Sex?\nMary Attenborough\n\n"

We kept the ball in their\nhalf much more, and finally, after about 25\nminutes, Ni ck Carr scored under the posts\nfrom a scrum, five yards out. The try was\nconverted. The match was by no means over\nthough, and it must be said that Goldsmiths'\nthrew everything they had at us (the water\nbucket, corner flags, a kit bag ...), and al though they came at us with a two man overlap about four times, they could not find a way through.\nThe final whistle blew leaving the score\n6-0, a thou roughly deserved victory for I.C., who, it must be remembered were playing\nwith one man short, and three new players\nin the pack.

However, even with the help of U.L. only six people turned up for the race.\nThe six turned up at the changing rooms\nof the Metropolitan Police at Hayes, Kent.\nAfter changing they set off for the start.\nOur problems started here. Only five of\nthe team made it to the correct start. It seem\n-ed that there were two races, starting not\n200 yards from each other.\nThe two races started. It was soon obvious that the University team was going to\nbe a nihil a ted by not only the Police, but\nalso Hercules Wimbledon, the other team we\nwere competing against.

The rest were\nRich 'Banana' Harrington in 18th, Maurice\n' Long John Silver' Wilson in 20th and fin-ally, keeping a brood y eye on his team from\nthe rear, 'Captain' Ian Alvey.

Ian Isherwood, wearing his new\n'traffic-light' gear, was 16th and Pete Barry,\nof somewhere in the Huxley Building, was\n17th. To summarize, we were beaten by our sel ves, and the course.

    "content": "Page\nThe Role of the Student Counsellor\nWhenever I'm asked to write a piece or give a talk about my job\nI'm aware of a certain inner resistance, I suppose this might be\nattributed in part to a natural streak of idleness, but I don't think\nthat's the whole story, and at least two other possible reasons\nspring to mind.\nOne is that it is dangerously easy to sound pretentious. It's an odd feature of my sort of work that is not susceptible of objective assessment, and what the individual student, or the Col leg e, itself as employer may regard as a useful interaction or as at is factory performance, may appear remarkably non-concrete when\nhonestly described in writing. Partly because of this, and no doubt\nfeeling a powerful urge to vindicate themselves, counsellors sometimes present evidence of their effectiveness which seems to me\nhighly questionable, not to say grand jose. The other reason is that while I myself find the work endlessly\nstimulating and rewarding, I think it unrealistic to assume that the\nworld at large will share this view - \"Student Counsellor\" does\nnot resonate as the possible title q faT. V. drama series. Of course\nthere is another side to this particular coin. Students themselves,\nand sometimes their teachers, may have powerful reasons of their\nown for not wishing to know about College support services, and\nperhaps especially about the student counsellor who is inevitably\nassociated in people's minds, one way or another, with academic\nor personal inadequacy, or both. This grossly distorted and sim-pli stic fantasy of what a counsellor's work actually entails has its\nroots firmly embedded in the prevailing ethic of the University world,\nwhich ascribes the highest value to intellectual competence, and\nwhich at this particular institution is sharply reinforced by male-dominance. It is I think quite difficult for a student here to acknowledge that he needs help, that he is vulnerable.\nWhat then is counselling? It is a professional helping relationship\nin which the aim is to put the student/client into a position where\nhe can cope with his own difficulties more effectively. It involves\na recognition of the integrity and uniqueness of the individual and\nof his need to make his own contract with the world. Counselling and paternalism are entirely in comp a table, and while almost all counselling relationships involve an element of support and friend-lines s, they also involve a degree of honesty which can be quite\ndemanding, and which marks them off from informal chat with friends\nand colleagues.\nWhat is so special about student's personal problems that justifies\na College in paying a professional helper? After all University entrants can hardly be perceived, except in the most trivial sense, as\na deprived group. Indeed in psychological and emotional terms they\nare likely to be far healthier than the population at large. I have no\ndoubt at all that if we made a random survey of passers-by in the\nHigh Street we would find amongst them a far higher proportion of\nserious social disability and of profound personal and emotional\nproblems than we would find in any University population.\nIn my opinion the answer lies in the critical combination of two\nfactors, namely the age-range of students, and the peculiar quality\nof academic endeavour. The student age-range largely coincides\nwith a phase of rapid personal and emotional change and development accompanied often enough by periods of anxiety and transitory\ndistress. Academic work, with inbuilt time limitations, by common\nconsent increasingly intense and competitive and demanding as u stained high level of intellectual efficiency, is peculiarly sus ce pta be to the destructive impact of anxiety and other kinds of psychological\ndisturbance. A young man or woman, for example, coping with the\nvery normal repercussions of a broken love affair may - if he or she\nis a bank clerk or a shop assistant - be able to work with relatively\nlittle loss of efficiency. Such a life event for a student can have\nquite damaging consequences. A few weeks of distress, of impaired\nability to concentrate, may make a disastrous impact on a whole\nyear's work - especially perhaps in sequential courses inseparable\nfrom science and technology. Anxiety and serious emotional .conflict,\nwhatever its source, almost invariably brings with it a marked fa 11-i off in work eff ice n cy for the university student - indeed that is the\nJnormal consequence of such experiences.\nI wouldn't wish to over drama tis e things. I know very well that we\nall have to accept quite serious problems from time to time as part\n\u2022 of the fabric of our lives, and we ride them out one way or another\nwithout recourse to support services. But the point needs to be\nfirmly made that everyone's self sufficiency is finite, and recognising that one has fallen, at least temporarily, below the threshold is\nan index of maturity not of immaturity. Of course sharing worries\nwith friends, family or teachers may be all that is needed, but if\nyou wish to see someone outside your Department in complete\nconfidence, who is easily accessible, and who has time to talk,\nyou are welcome to contact me. If it's any comfort to you 1 will almost certainly have come across something of the kind before!\nMy office is at 14 Princes Gardens, and you can call on spec,\nor ring me on Internal 4205.\nDon Adlington\nEntry Form L.P.S. Ruling\nEntry Form For Competition\nRules: The competition starts at 14 DO and is between\nteams of five members.\nThe first team member has to inflate a condom (which will be provided) until its circumference is 72 cm and then tie a knot in it. He then hands over to the next competitor who\nrepeats the process and so on until all five have finished.\nThe first team to do so wins a bottle of whisky.\nNo artificial methods of inflation may be used.\nName of Team: Team Members: 1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nReturn to Union Office by 5.00 pm on Tuesday 30th January.\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal decision in the case\nof Demuren V. Seal Estates Ltd. on the 12th of December\n1978, it would seem likely that all L.P.S.' licensees' are\njoint tenants. This means that you now have security of\ntenure and the right to apply to the Rent Officer for the\nRegistration of a Fair Rent.\nA meeting will be held in the Senior Common Room in the\nUnion Holding at 1 p.m. on Tuesday the 30th of January\nto which all L.P.S. tenants are invited to discuss the transcript of the case, and the possibilities arising from it. All other ' licensees' welcome.\nIn the meantime any efforts by the landlords to alter ex is ting arrangements must be strenuously opposed.\nN.B. This does not apply to college flats in L.P.S. proper t ies.\n\n"

It works through a network of small groups which meet regularly each week in the halls of residence and college departments.\nDuring Contact Week, each of the groups of students acts as host to\na member of the Contact Week Team. The team member will in most cases be\nliving in a hall of residence as the guest of the group that meets there.\nAs you can see, the team are a varied and interesting bunch of people.\nThy will be contributing their insight and experience to the various informal\nmeetings and discussions which will be happening around them. The team are\nnot just here for the benefit of the regular members of the Chaplaincy groups\nbut to stimulate thought and discussion about ethical and spiritual matters\ngenerally in the halls and departments where they are based.\nSo look out for notices in your hall or department and come along and\njoin in the discussion, whatever your point of view! We like a good argument!\nThe Chaplaincy is organising three special lectures this week, two in IC and\none in QEC. You're sure to find at least one of them of interest to you.\nYou' ll be very welcome at any of the other events, social or serious listed in the programme.\nSister Joyce.

Alexander the Great, Captain\nJames Cook, Mungo Parke, Christopher Columbus, Burke and Wills, and Marco Polo to\nname but a few legendary figures, have all\nat one time or another been members of the\nI.C. Exploration Society. The extraordinary\nand phenomenal interest expressed by members of the college has literally forced me\nto put pen to paper and to inform any savages lurking out there in the wilds who may\nnot have heard about this legend ayy society\nto beware of its gripping powers. Only recently, several members have been so overcome\nby the fascinating ly interesting meetings\nthat they have found it impossible to miss\na single meeting. While others, finding the\nfirst meeting of last term so provoking, have\nwalked off into the wilds and have never\nbeen seen since(l). Back to sanity and truth, the exploration\nsociety had a very active list of events last\nterm - over one a week on average. The\nsociety is a meeting ground for all people\ninterested in exploring, and is not a college\ntravel agency which supplies 'pre-packaged'\nholidays to exotic places for those who re quest them. Instead, it is a very useful\nmeans by which people can get ideas for\nexpeditions, from where to go and what to\ndo, down to whom to contact for such a a thing.\nFISHING\nTRIP\nIf you fancy a nice cod for breakfast on a Monday morning, why don't you come for an\nall night fishing session with us? We're\nthinking of a trip to the East Anglain coast\nline (in I.C. transport), to somewhere between Harwich and Lowestoft probably on Sat.\n3rd Sunday 4th February.\nAgenda: 1. Bait digging at low tide on Sat.\n2 .Find a nice beach, rock outcrop\nor pier, when ea few cod may be\nhanging out.\n3. Settle down there for a good ni-gh t's fishing.\n4. Return to I.C. early Sunday Morning and crash out.\n\u2014 Don't worry about not having any tackle;\nif you're remotely interested in fishing of\nany kind we will be only too pleased to\nmeet you and have you accompany us. (Note;\nthe subsidies available should make this a worthwhile weekend for any fisherman bug-ge red off with London life).\nHow About It?\nMeet in South side Upper Lounge, About\n1 o 'clock Thurs. 1st Feb. (look out for fishing rods and that will be us), or see Noel\nPreston, Room 663, Selkirk Hall. Red Cross\nThe industrial action by drivers and at ten \u00bb\nd ants of the London Ambulance Service, who\nare members of NAL GO last Monday, left\nLondon without its emergency ambulance\nservice.\nTogether with the St. John's Ambulance\nBrigade and the Royal Army Medical Corp\nthe Red Cross helped to provide cover for\nemergencies over that period.\nTheir action was confined to \" life or death'\nemergency only and response was following\nrequests from the police or doctors only.\nThe voluntary services made it quite\nclear that their action was in no way intended to be\" strike breaking\" but was purely\nhumanitarian in intention. It is clear that\nwithout the first class work of the London\nAmbulance Service, the safety and well being\nof the population of our capital would be in\njeopardy.\nHowever, the existence of trained volunteers within the community, able to respond\nto emergencies of any kind, is an essential\nadjunct to statutory services.\nWe need trained volunteers now! Why not\ncome along to our first aid training ses s ions, on Thursday evenings at 5.30 pm in\nthe Bot/Zoo Common Room under the Union\nArch.\nSince 1956, there have been over eighty\nexpeditions to areas all over the world.\nEach trip has had a specific aim such as\nclimbing some mountains, discovering a cave\nsystem, while many others have involved\nstudies of certain aspects of Biology, Meteorology, Archaeology, Geology and Social\nBehaviour (to name but a few). Due to the\nfact that most of the money comes from\nsponsors such as industrial firms and\ncharities, it is necessary \" to do something\nworthwhile\" on the expedition, and not just\nto roam about in some far-away place. There are several expeditions being organised\nfor next summer.\nMeetings last term have consisted of illustrated talks by students who have been\non adventures, practical talks on how to go\nabout planning an expedition, including a one-day symposium in Leeds on all kinds\nof practical aspects, a couple of associa ted studies talks on polar regions and underwater exploration, and other sundry\nevents. We also combine meetings with the\nRoyal Geographical Society (of which we are\ncorporate members) and these meetings have\nvaried from talks about volcanoes, to talks\nabout expedition film making. All meetings\nhave included slides or films as well. There are many unique facilities at I.C. for the prospective explorer. The I.C. exploration Board, which consists of student\nunion representatives and members of the\nacademic staff and old student associations,\nexists to provide guidance, advice and financial support towards an adventure. This,> together with the R.G. S., Young Explorers'\nTrust (also at the R.G. S.) which can deal\nwith any problem, means that a wealth of\nassistance of every kind is available.

Sec. is also returning officer for all the numerous elections that the Union has - this\nruns from the relatively simple job when on ly one candidate stands, to running sabbat-ical elections (complete with ballot boxes)\nand any referenda that crop up, the Hon.

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LIBERAL CLUB\nPage 22i Last Tuesday's edition of FORWARD!, the newspaper of Imperial College Liberal Club led with an article stating that the Exec\nhad 'chickened out' over the refectory boycott. The paper believes\nthat College still needs to be convinced as to how bad the food really is - and an efficient, well-organised 24 hour boycott seems to be\nthe only way to do this.\nFORWARD J, in a paragraph on Hugh Barrett's involvement with\nLondon Student Travel notes that he has given repeated assurances\nthat he would resign his directorship on leaving office as President\nof ICU. Hugh is criticised because he \" has made little effort himself to v stimulate any interest\" in getting suitable people to sit on\nthe L ST board while remaining a director of the company.\nAnother item in FORWARD! discussed the 'Media at IC'. The\narticle opens by stating that we are very fortunate at Imperial in\nthat we have three quite excellent media services in FELIX, IC\nRadio and STOIC. It continues by giving its own answers to the\nquestion, \" Are we- getting the most out of them?\" The criticism of production, staff and personal aspects provoked\nimmediate and angry response especially from IC Radio and STOIC. Although there are all round criticisms in FORWARD! the media\nare particularly upset. It looks as if this topic will drag on for some\ntime. An official Press Release from IC Liberal Club is printed.be-low.\nThe article on 'Media at IC' which appeared in the January issue\nof FORWARD '.contained the suggestion that the National Westminster Bank might be offering IC Radio a sum in excess of \u00a31000 in\nexchange for advertising their branch in the Sherfield Building, and\nthis was followed by a discussion on how such money - if offered-should be spent-. This was reported as a rumour. Rumours remain\nas such until discounted by fact. In this case, it appears that a misunderstanding may have arisen and we are now convinced that such\na suggestion has no foundation in fact.\nThe same article also i discussed the editorial nature of STOIC,\nand the opinions expressed, we feel, were fully justified.\nThe Committee of IC Liberal Club appointed Paul Fairbairn as\nEditor of FORWARD! and entrusted him with responsibility for en-su ring, to the best of his ability, that the views expressed generally reflect the views of members of the Club as a whole. Articles,\ntherefore, do not express individual points of view, and are not\ncredited to particular contributors. This has been so for every edition of FORWARD! in -its two years of publication. It is our view\nthat individual opinions should be put through FELIX or other IC\nUnion media.\nThe right to criticise both organisations and individuals in the\npublic eye should be upheld at all cost.\nFORWARD! STOIC's Reply\nI was most annoyed to see that an article published recently in\nFORWARD! - the news paper of IC Liberal Club - contained allegations about the management and editorial control of STOIC.\nI feel it is important to point out that the control of STOIC is totally in the hands of its student membership. Colin Grimshaw, the\nstudio staff member, has the role of purely a technical supervisor,\nand he is only concerned with the direction of programmes i.e. visual and audio quality. Experience in this specialist field takes al long time to acquire, and Colin' s could not be matched by any of\nour members. It is also a College rule that one of the studio staff\nbe present at all times whilst - STOIC are there: Colin, who is College staff (not employed by Electrical Engineering as stated in\nFORWARD!), is in fact the only person qualified in College to assist in such a manner. Whilst we maintain technical control, we feel\nthat Colin' s advice has always been a major factor in the high technical standard of our programmes, and it is very much appreciated.\nConcerning the comment that ' STOIC... shy away from material of\na serious nature' I would like to remind the author that the last two\neditions have contained items on ICU elections, ASTM S dispute,\nhousing and accommodation problems, refectory prices and the threatened N UP E strike. Personally I would regard these as serious.\nIt has been put forward in defence of the article that FORWARD! is regarded as a joke by IC students. However, I feel this is not the\ncase, and anything associating itself with the Liberal Party, which\nis define t ely not a joke, is going to be read in all seriousness.\nA more disturbing aspect of this feature is that it was written\nanonymously by a member of ICU Publications Board (STOIC'S governing body). It seems very unfortunate that a member oL an ICU\nmajor subcommittee feels frightened to openly criticise another\nmember organization of that committee and has to resort to anonymous\ndefamation and non-constructive criticism. Obviously STOIC has recently been through a de moral ising few\nmonths caused by the ASTM S dispute, and resulting in a diminished\nmembership, but the statement 'To be frank, there seems little hope\nof improvement' Is, I feel, totally unjustified.\nPaul Johnson\nChairman, STOIC\nPS Also, please note that despite allegations of being unimaginative and having no forward planning, STOIC transmitted the first in\na series of many of a totally new Tuesday programme this week.\nThey will feature many of the Clubs and Societies at IC and we\nhave received a lot of interest concerning these.\nEds note ; Roger Stotesbury has never made any secret of the fact\nthat he wrote that article as an individual. I feel that to have put\nhis position in the Union at the foot of the article would have\nimplied that it was the opinion of Pub. Board as a whole which\nwould be wrong.\ncon td. from front page\nMary Attenborough claims that prices should only have gone up by\nhalf these amounts as basic food prices form only half of the cost\nof the refectory service. Other costs such as staff wages, equip me nt, electricity and gas are unaffected by increased food costs and so\nthe amount paid by the customer for these elements should remain\nunchanged.\nWhen the regulator was set up\nit was understood that its use\nwould be limited to the cost of\nfood. The minutes of the Refectory Finance Subcommittee of that\ntime record that: \" After much discussion the Committee decided\nthat it would be wrong to use the\nregulator to cover costs other\nthan rises in food prices\". But\nsince that time rises in the FT' Grocery Index have resulted in\nequivalent overall rises in re fec Committee Chairman Professor\nE il on refused to allow a vote on\nthis proposal saying th av he would\n\" not allow the Committee to take\nirresponsible decisions\". He\nmaintained that this was a completely new proposal which would\nfirst have to be discussed by the\nFinance Subcommittee. He also refused to permit the suspension\nof the regulator pending a dec i sion as to its future use. However, Domestic Secretary Captain\nLindley intimated that the re gu tory prices. At a Refectory Committee meet- lat or would not be used in Fe bing on Thursday last week ICU's u ary. eight representatives raised this Professor E il on, when asked by\nmatter and proposed that the use a FELIX reporter for his comments\nof the regulator be limited to food on the use of the regulator, ref u costs in future. But Refectory sed to answer any questions.\n6\nE7_ \u00a3_\ni_F6 T E_\n1 m* \u00a3\nmm \u2022\nDI BQ HQ fl\nCROSSWORD 505 was won by R WATSON' CHEM. ENG. II\n\n"

Refectories at other colleges were more sub sidi sed than ours\nand even some local restaurants were cheaper.\nChris Fox, one of ICU's eight Further bye4 aw amendments\nrepresentatives on Refectory Com- preparing the way for a sabbatical\nmitte e, was worried that a boycott Union Deputy President were g iwo uf d damage the Union' scam ven a first reading,\npa ign for the use of the regulator Housing\nto be changed, but the meeting\naccepted the proposal without\nopposition.\nUnion President Mary Attenborough appealed for mass support for the boycott.\nU GM Chairman\nSheyne Lucock speaking to his housing motion.\n' STUDENTS MISLED' Students are being misled over the use of the regulator to tie refectory prices to inflation and price rises are too high, according to\nIC Union President Mary Attenborough .Former President Hugh Barrett also feels that students have been led astray.\nThe regulator is the means by which refectory prices go up whenever there is a rise in the Financial Times Grocery Index. It was set up in 1976 to allow increased costs of basic foodstuffs to be\npassed on to the customer without delay. The FT Grocery Index increased by 1.9 percent in November and 1.4 percent in December\nresulting in refectory price rises of the same percentages on ^st\nDecember and 8th January. con td. on back page\nA motion on housing proposed\nby External Affairs Officer Sheyne\nLu cock proved highly controversial.

N UP E members at some of the other Colle ges of London University took\npart in the action which was in\nprotest against low pay.\nRecord Rag Collection\nRag Chairman Graham Cox announced that about \u00a313,000\ngross has been collected for rag\nso far this year. The total net\nsum collected last year was about\n\u00a37,500.\nIC Rag is now one of the top\nten Rags in the country according to a recent national Rag Conference .

After the\nvotes were counted the election\nwas found to be in quo rate but\ncould be ratified by aUG M.330 students voted ... over 200 votes\nbelow the total required for a quo rate election.\nCadmium Findings\nResearch carried out in IC's geology department caused front\npage news last weekend when\n1,200 villagers of Shipham in\nSomerset were told that the high\nlevel of cadmium in their soil\ncould be a health hazard.\nThe research project led by\nProfessor J.S. Webb surveyed 21\nmetals in the soil of England and\nWales. In August last year the\nresearchers informed the Department of the Environment that the\nvillage of Shipham had levels of\ncadmium in the soil of 100, and\nin some places1,000, times the\nnational average.\nCadmium is a toxic metal capable of causing disease and even\ndeath if ingested in small quant i ties. The villagers are to be medi call y examined to see if anyone\nhas been harmed .\nProwler Returns\nA man was seen prowling around the ladies' toilets in the\nUnion Building on Friday and was]\nspotted in a Be it bathroom last\nTuesday. The man is described\nas Negroid, possibly half-caste\nabout 25 years old, clean shaven\nwith a rough complexion. He is\nwell built and about 6 ft. 1 inch\ntall.

    "content": "Page i) ON FEELING DEPRESSED\nSome poet -no doubt the one who said' A garden is a loathsome\nthing God wot' - described this time of year as a season of mists and yellow uselessness. It is also the season of influenza s, colds\nand sore throats. For some people it is a time for feeling depressed\nand their mood is like the grey sky.\nWe have, I suppose, all felt depressed at one time or another.\nThe individual depth of our despair will vary and the length of time\nfor which we have this feeling of hopelessness will be considerable\n- from a few hours to months.\nThe trouble with depression is that when you are feeling depressed\nthere seems no earthly reason why the feeling should go and when\nyou are young then you don't have the advantage of experience wh idi has taught many people to recognise their depressed periods and to\nrecognise their own pattern of mood swing. For the younger person\nthese mood swings may be more extreme, varying from heights to\nthe depths.\nDepression brings feelings of guilt and in com pet ance, sleep disturbance, a general loss of drive and a difficulty in thinking clearly\nas well as a feeling of physical ill health. These are some of the\nfactors which make it hard to seek help and also difficult for the\ndoctor to recognise. Indeed when are are low and depressed we can\nbehave in quite a self destructive way.\nOften depression is self limiting and quite short, but it can be\nlonger and more severe and very disruptive of study and work\nbecause concentration is difficult. Also the decisions depressed\npeople take are depressed decisions which they would not take\nwhen feeling normal. If this sort of depression is not recognised\nthen the results can be serious.\nVarious sorts of depression are described. Some people have cyclical mood swings from cheerfulness into gloom. These people often\nrecognise when they are low - they have been there before - and they\naccept that they may always have a down in the Spring or possibly the Autumn. Some people get depressed more easily by c irc um stan ces although it may not be clear to them what exactly is the circumstance which has triggered the depression. Loss of a close relative\nor a friend is not an uncommon trigger and the expression ' loss of\na loved object'is one used by Psychiatrists. Depression is seen as\nanger turned inwards against oneself, and anger and guilt are two\ncommon feelings together with that feeling of worthlessness that\noccurs in extreme cases. But depression can also be accompanied by chemical disturbance\nin the brain. This is at the junction between the nerves - called neurone s where transmission of messages from one nerve to\nanother or to many others is by a chemical process. It is this transmitter that becomes less effective while the impulses which pass\nalong the nerve by an electrical process are unaffected. The pattern of depression caused by this chemical disorder is often very\nspecific and the type of depression is often treated by specific drugs\nas well as support and psychotherapy.\nIndeed the depression which is reactive to some event or loss can\nprogress to a chemical depression which colours ones attitude to\nlife and other people. Not for nothing has it been called the ' Blue Plague'. If you are getting depressed and life seems to be rather grim, DON'T TAKE DEPRESSED DECISIONS, COME AND GET SOME HELP WITH SORTING IT ALL OUT. NIGHTLINE.\nSOMEONE TO TALK TO\nNightline 6 pm to 9 am 581 2468 Int 2468\nNightline now has information on most things that affect\nstudent life, and we usually have a list of college bands,\nfilms and bops in the West London area. We also provide a focus where people can find a friendly\naccepting atmosphere in which to think and talk about anything that is worrying them. You certainly don't have to be\nsuicidal to come and see us, or to phone us up. Often our\ncallers are just interested to find out what we do, and don't have a 'problem' at all! j As many of our volunteers are 3rd years we are keen to\nhave new volunteers this term. So if you think that you could\nlisten constructively to some one, and can spare one night\nevery 2 or 3 weeks, get in touch with us to find out about\nour next training session. You can either phone us, call round, or come to our stall at the welfare Afternoon.\n01-581 2468\nInt. 2468\n\n"

    "content": "Page iii)\nWhat you can get from\nThe Welfare Centre\nWelfare Fair\nNext Wednesday, as you may have heard, there will be a grand\nevent in the J CR during the afternoon. The emphasis will be on\nentertainment more than anything else, but the underlying motive\nis to give you some idea of any of the Health and Welfare services\nin the college which you may not yet have had any personal con tact with and also to introduce other organisations which are concerned with helping the individual to'survive in an increasingly\nhostile environment. We also hope to show you that these subjects) are not only relevant when you need them but that they are\ninteresting enough to be thought about even when they don't directly affect you. In this issue of FELIX, you will find art cles by\nthe other college Welfare services and in that context, you might\nbe interested to know something more about the Welfare Centre and\nthe kind of problems and issues that it deals with. The Welfare Centre has now been operating on a full time basis\nfor just over a year and during that time there has been a considerable expansion in the numbers of people using it, so that las*\nterm, for example, there j were over 1200 enquiries handled.\nSo, what's it all about? Well there are two sides to the Welfare\nCentre's work, answering questions and so on from people who visit us and working on projects which affect sections of the college\nrather than individuals. The most important topic, which affects everybody at some time\nor other is housing. The main options available at present when\none is looking for somewhere to live are the University Accommodation Office, which has a problem in that it is very heavily used\nand so can't always come up with what you want, and flat agencies\nwhich often charge a great deal of money for doing virtually nothing-even if you can find one that is prepared to help you. In this cont-ext, the role of the Student Union is clearly very important to fill the considerable gaps left by other sources of accommodation. The Union is in a fortunate position in this respect in that it is an organisation which gives it an advantage over individual home hunters\nin a number of ways: Bedsits etc.\nLandladies seem very choosy these days about the kind of people\nthat they lj let their rooms to, owing to the restrictions that are\nimposed upon them by law when it comes to dealing with bad\ntenants. As a result, they feel much happier having someone from\nan identifiable source because they feel, rightly or wrongly, that\nthis gives them some guarantee as to the character of the prospective tenant and also someone to talk to if the arrangement goes wrong.\nWith this in mind, we have been actively recruiting this type of\naccommodation with the result that there are at present over four\nhundred landladies on our books, many of them as much concerned\nwith helping people who have nowhere to live as with making any\ngreat profit themselves.\nAlthough this is a step in the right direction, it only goes a small\nway to solving the problem as a whole and oj her schemes are being\nexamined, which again rely heavily on the existence of the Union\nand would be virtually in acc es i ble to the individual on his or her\nown.\nCompany lets\nThose of you who have been through the harrowing experience\nof looking for somewhere to live have probably come up against\nlandlords and agencies who are only prepared to let to companies\nand an answer to this would be for the Union to set up a company which could then take on this kind of tenancy. The problem\nwith this is that it is blatant avoidance of the Rent Acts and is therefore a matter of weighing up the moral issues involved against\nthe potential advantages to be gained.\nHead Tenancies\nThis is the kind of arrangement where the Union would take on\nplaces, usually from big corporate landlords, and then let them to\nstudents, which means that they wouldn't be Rent Act protected.\nThe kind of accommodation that one could get in this way would\nprobably not normally be available to students on a protected ten an cy, if at all, because the main concern of big landlords is to maintain the value of their investment and so it would be most prejudicial to their objectives if they were to allow any of their occ u piers to come within the Rent Acts. It is interesting to note that\nthis option is not a Rent Act loophole but a specific exception to\nthe Rent Acts, presumably designed to cope with the special needs\nof students and colleges. Housing Associations\nThis is something that could be set up in the same way as the big Housing Associations are with a loan from the Housing Corporation.\nThere are a number of obstacles to be overcome but we are at present\nexamining the viability of the Union's involvement in such a scheme.\nLocal Authority Accommodation\nFrom time to time, local authorities decide that blocks of council flats or bits of blocks are more trouble than they are worth, e.g. be cause no one wants to live in them. They are then quite willing to\nhive them off to other organisations like student Unions. They don't tend to be the last word in desirable residences but they are usually very cheap and we want to be in a position to leap in if there are any\nup for grabs.\nDiscussions on many of these projects are at a very early stage at\npresent but it is hoped that in time something will come of them and\nthat we will then be able to solve our housing shortage for once and\nfor all. Other areas of work which fall into the category of sectional rather\nthan individual help are our attempts to get Local Education Authorities to change their tune on giving grants to overseas students who\nhave been here for three years and helping with legal type problems\nthat arise in the context of the Union as a whole.\nAs far as individual enquiries go, they tend to be very varied-the\nsort of thing one might go to a Neighbourhood Law Centre or a Citi z ens Advice Bureau for. For example:-Finding Somewhere To Live\nThe Welfare Centre has a fair sized list of landlords and usually some current vacancies as long as you are not too fussy about living a few miles from college. There is also a list of flat agencies which might come in useful.\nLandlord Problems\nThese are not infrequent as some landlords do not seem to realise that their tenants have a right to be treated as human beings rather\nthan inmates of a boarding kennels. The legal ramifications of this\nsubject are such that it is best to come along to the Welfare Centre\nfor a chat about it if you feel that a breakdown in relations with\nyour landlord is in the offing.\nConsumer matters\nIf you buy something from a shop and it turns out to have something wrong with it, you can usually take it back and choose between your money back and a replacement. You don't have to accept\na credit note. If on the other hand you buy something from a private\nindividual, there is no statutory protection and your rights depend\nentirely on your agreement with the sell eri.e. if the seller makes\na statement about the thing you are buying, which turns out to be\nuntrue then you may be able to get your money back but if you buy\nsomething from someone who doesn't make any promises about what\nyou are buying and it turns out to be useless then there is nothing\nmuch you can do about it.\nWelfare Benefits\nYou can find out at the Welfare Centre about supplementary bene-fit, Unemployment Benefit, free glasses, and other such things.\nCovenants\nThere will be a change in the tax arrangements in April which means that parents no longer get a child tax allowance. The significance of this is that anyone who is in receipt of a parental contribution to their grant can increase their income from their parents by\nhalf as much again simply by getting their parents to sign a deed of\ncovenant. Even now most people who don't get a full grant could reap substantial benefits in this way. Contacts with the Police Most policemen are con cie n tio us up holders of the law and civilisation as we know it. Also, everyone has lots of 'rights' to prevent\nthem from suffering injustices. Unfortunately, however, some police men (it is rumored) are a bit too con cie n tio us and your rights are so\ncomplicated and riddled with exceptions that it can be dangerous to\nrely on them. The golden rule then, is to desist from annoying any\npolicemen with whom you come into contact but to avoid at all costs\nany attempts to make you say or write anything which could incriminate you. The right to silence, although under fire, is still sacrosanct. The other thing worth remembering is your right under the\nCriminal Law Act to make a phone call from the police station, if you\nare arrested, to let someone in the outside world know where you are.\nMost people only have contact with the police in the context of\nmotoring offences and if you want any information on the sentences\nand defences available I should be able to give you some indica tion.\nThe Welfare Centre can also help with any legal enquiries or\nwith other related topics.\nAnyway, don't forget to come along to the J. C.R. on Wednesday\n- even if it's only for the beer.\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\n\n"

    "content": "Page 3\nFORWARD Attacks Media\nFORWARD, the newspaper of Imperial College Liberal Club,\nlaunched an unprecedented three-pronged attack on the media, and\nthe individuals in them, in an article entitled \" Media at IC\" last\nTuesday.\nI know that the intention of that article was to provoke discus sion on problems discerned within the media and to that end it\nsucceeded! Unfortunately, there were many repercussions that\nwere unforeseen.\nAdmission\nI, for my part, would like to take responsibility for the IC Radio\nsection as I supplied the details that appeared in the text. I did not\nfabricate any of them, however, but merely relayed rumours that I felt would cr eat debate. I am sorry if these rumours were unfounded\nand for any distress I may have caused John Allen in disrupting his\nteam. I particularly appreciate the difficulty created for Karen and\nHarvey.\nComplacency\nI feel very strongly that any group which remains un-criticised\nfor too long becomes complacent and therefore fails to provide their\nbest. Each media at IC has its own particular internal problems and\nbeing reminded of them from time to time can only do good. Sensationalist material of the kind I provided, however, achieves nothing\nespecially as Tdidn't have the guts\" to sign my name.\nSTOIC\nMay I appeal to Colin Grimshaw that, rather than reinforce the\nopinions of the author of the STOIC section, he continues to provide the technical help that STOIC relies on.\nStaff wanted\nVolunteers are needed to work on FELIX, this newspaper. News\nreporters and paste-up artists are especially required but any short\nstories, reviews etc. will be welcome. If there is sufficient response\nthen I will organize a\" guided tour\" of the print unit to familiaris e everyone with techniques of production.\nRefectory Boycott\nIt was with dismay that I watched a UGM vote to continue with a boycott of Southside refectories. What is the use of threatening to\nhave a boycott if prices increase if the boycott goes ahead anyway\nwhen they don't? What can the Union threaten next time? It seems\nto me that we will only lose credibility and harden attitudes by this\ncourse of action. If there are those who wish to complain about\nquality I suggest they do so via the complaints books and letters to\nFELIX rather than using the ultimate weapon at the first opportunity.\nCredits\nFirstly, Paul Williams for his superb cartoon. David Crable promised to buy me two pints if I wrote the following: It seems a very\nsad, nay, disastrous day when one printed publication has little\nbetter to do then gang up on three worthwhile media. Cheers. Dave!\nThanks also to John, Sonia, Colin and Sheyne for photos, paste-ups,\nstories and collating in no particular order. Anita typed her largest\nFELIX to date, and Ian printed it all in two days (if he prints it all\nin two days that is). Cheers,\nJohn\nPS The Compset 550 has just arrived!\nALL AROUND THE QUADRANGLE\nA non-female was spotted inside the 'Ladies' on the Union Building's first floor last Friday. Well, he is a braver person that I. The girls' room is nicely situated between the Union Ear and\nDramsoc. These are both full of heavily built human beings just it ching to go into battle.\nOnly two days earlier there was a false rape alarm. It's amazing\nhow quickly people arrive on the scene. A special \"three cheers\" for Big Malcolm, who managed to put on his shoes whilst sprinting\nacross'the Quad.\nIf anyone else is seen in these ' Ladies' who obviously shouldn't be there let Malcolm know. Also anybody who is likely to fool around\nup there just for a joke, I offer one word of advice. DON'T. You\nwon't find it so funny afterwards.\nGood for Mary for pointing out that El Vino's discriminate against women in not allowing them to be served at the bar. I noticed no\nmention was made of this in the advert! However I'm afraid I shall\nnot be supporting a boycott even though I do not approve of this\npractice. I hope I can be forgiven for feeling that such action will\nsolve little. I think it's an unfortunate venue and I trust that an\nalternative will be found in future.\nDid you know that FELIX distributes about a million sheets of\npaper during a students nominal three year stay at I.C.I wonder how\nmany trees that is?\nOn paper the prospects are terrific: theatre, cinema, nightclub and\nconcert music from opera to folk, jazz and orchestral.\nWith these all seasoned by a promised topical debate I feel-sure\nthat students can for once have \" City entertainment in the 'home'\nso to speak.\nNext SCAB evening needs to be a great success. I see no reason\nwhy it cannot be so. Let's forget previous events and make sure\nthat the right people are encouraged to attend a great evening's entertainment.\nIt's not too early to plan for next year when considering this sort\nof event.\nThe Union Lower Lounge looks great, though someone's bound to\ndislike the colour scheme. The new carpet should arrive over the\nEaster vacation.\nSome D.P. from the distant past had lino, laid around the bar so\npreventing the wooden floor from breathing. This should be put to\nrights quite soon with the rotten wood floor being replaced by con crete .\nDespite ail this, the atm osr here in the Lower Lounge has not\naltered.\nFrom a well known hymn: \" Change and Decay in All Around I..C.0 Thou That Changest Not, Abide With Me.\" Would someone please explain why Beit Fire Bell sounded with\nthe rape alarm. It's got me quite worried. Cheers !\nJohn Shuttle worth\nI do not wish to comment on the last SCAB NITE, but what of\nnext year. Social, Cultural and Amusement Board consist of those\nI.C. societies presenting formal entertainment.\n'HOME SOLDIER HOME'\nA film documentary using interviews with ex soldiers, and including footage of\nthe Army in action in Ireland and in other\ncolonial wars to show the anti working class and partisan nature of the British Army.
