C. to finish building\nthe floats and to sample\nthe wares of Scottish and\nNewcastle who provided\nnot only a lorry but a fine\nbarrel of Tartan. Here the\nenforced branch who were\nto be our escorts first\nmade their presence felt\u2014\nby consuming a goodly\npercentage of the aforementioned Tartan. SUK Rag Chairman Armitage\nwas seen to 'buy' the\npoliceman a round \u2014 of\nfree Tartan. Is this Charity?\nMeanwhile Dave Roberts\nof Q.E.

London only) starring\nMick, Male and Perry.\nLinstead Hall produced a Viking Ship, a seemingly\nunlimited supply of Foster's which must have fallen off the back of their\nbar, and half-a hundred-weight of flour, some of\nwhich very soon attacked\nChairman Armflutter (a direct hit) and John Morgan's Lanchester (about\ntwenty direct hits).

Progress down\nKensington High Street\nwas not quite slow enough\nto stop passing traffic, but\njust past the Albert Hall a gorilla and can were seen\nproceeding in the wrong\ndirection down the oncoming fast lane aided and\nabetted by a large, very\nfeminine cat wearing red\nclogs. In fact the gorilla\ncontinued playing with\npussy all day.\nAll available cars were\ncajoled and threatened\nuntil their occupants paid\nup, including the tail back in Hyde Park underpass.\nAfter several impromptu\nhalts whilst the hard-drink-ing horses relieved themselves (likewise six\npolicemen shoulder-to-shoulder in Sloane Square\ngutters) the procession\nfinally ground to a halt outside Sidney Street's public\nconvenience. These stops\nshould be planned in\nfuture. Once under way\nagain, the IC and QE C Rag Chairmen were lost to\nview, re-emerging way past\nHarrods armed with brimming pint pots\u2014one of\nwhich went to the art ic driver, already surrounded\nby empties.\nOn arrival back a QE C Linstead hurled in all\ndirections, and a wooden\nkeg of Young's bitter was\nattacked with gusto.\nMartin Black's hat and\nother trophies changed\nhands.

For all you\nknow this article could have\nbeen called from the charred\nremains of a secret manuscript\nsmuggled out of a holiday camp\nsomewhere west of Hounslow.\nThe Friday before last the\nLondon University Conservative\nAssociation (LUCA to its\nfriends) held its annual dinner\nat the House of Commons with\nEnoch Powell, a vice-president\nof LUCA, as the guest speaker.\nApparently they have the\nsecond largest Conservative\nSociety in London University;\nconsidering this it was not very\nwell represented at the dinner,\nmost people were either from\nKIBBUTZ\nWhat's it all about.

The\nthree-course meal was pleasant\nbut not impressive although it\nwas a definite improvement on\nMooney (what isn't, you may\nwell ask). After the meal the\nchairman of LUCA proposed a toast to the government which\nwas replied to \"on behalf of\nHer Majesty's Government\" by\nEnoch Powell who seemed to\nprefer the idea that he was\nspeaking on behalf of the Conservative Party.\nHe then launched on his expected attack on the govern-ment. The \"in\" subject now is\nof course the Common Market\nbut this was just an excuse to\naccuse the government of\nusing immoral pressures to\nensure a majority in the vote on\nthe Second Reading of the Common Market Bill on Thursday\n17th. \"We all carry with us a little\ndust from the rungs by which\nwe have ascended. The Prime\nMinister was once a Chief Whip,\na very efficient Chief Wbip; and\nthere is a sense in which it is\ntrue to say that 'Once a Chief\nWhip, always a Chief Whip\".\nMr. Powell went on to say that\nnothing but the full-hearted comment of this nation could authorise British entry into the Community. \"Its place cannot be\ntaken by a sum majority in the\nHouse of Commons engineered\nby intimidation and shady dealing . . . what is to be feared is\nthat in the process a discredit\nnot easily removed again will be\nleft sticking to the government,\nto this Party, and to the House\nof Commons itself.\"\nIt is interesting to read this\nin light of the vote on Thursday\n17th, when the Government had\na majority of only eight. However, those who saw Mr. Roy\nMellish, the Labour Chief Whip\non television after the vote will\nno doubt agree that the only\ndiscredit has been left sticking\nto the Labour Party who saw it\nas an excuse to overthrow the\nGovernment whatever the cost\nto the country.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, 24th February, 1972\nREVIEWS Firstly, as a general 'puff. At\nthe moment of writing the Electricity picture (thinks) looks\ngrim, but many theatres have\narranged for their own genera-tor, details in Press. Now is a good time to see a play without\nwasting your invaluable work\ntime.\nThe produce of the Theatre\nOf Half-Remembered Fact Which\nMay Or May Not Be True seems\nto be increasingly popular in the\nEnglish-speaking Theatre now a days, and London attracts its\nfair share of such plays as audiences flock (note subtle allusion\nto sheep) to see actors moping\naround, musing over a past,\nperhaps real, perhaps imagined.\nNothing really happens, and the\ncritics, who don't pay for their\ntickets anyway, leave the theatre\nmaking admiring clucking\nnoises.\nI didn't pay for my tickets\neither, but that I am afraid did\nnot stop me nodding off once or\ntwice during Edward Albee's 'All Over' (Aldwych, Royal\nShakespeare Company). The\ntheme is simple. A man, of whom\nwe learn little but that he is old,\nfamous and rich, is dying, and\nhis family and friends gather\nround him in a beautifully musty\nJohn Bury set. His wife, a stable\nwoman sadly reminiscing about\n'the little girl I was when he\ncame to me' is there, and so are\nthe Mistress, the Best Friend, the\nIssue and the Medical Assistance. The characters talk (and\ntalk and talk) and the history of\nthe case is slowly revealed until\nthe man eventually dies just before the final curtain (oh look!\nI 've given the end away!)\nBut despite the good acting\ninvolved, including Peggy Ashcroft, Sebastian Shaw and a rather mis-cast Sheila Hancock,\nthere seems nothing compelling\nin the piece. The assumed\nPEGGYASHCROFT:The wife\nPlays\nAmerican accents do not help\u2014\nthey vary from Deep Georgia\nto better Roedean\u2014and Albee's dialogue (so good in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?') is\nlargely unattractive in it's violent\nevasions of Cliche. This reminiscent type of drama can be very\neffectively created, such as in\nMiller's 'The Price', but this play\nis in my view, neither particularly dramatic nor effective.\nMeanwhile, back at the Old\nVic, Stoppard rides again. I have a great respect for Tom\nStoppard's plays, mainly, I think,\nfor their refreshingly humorous\nobliquity, mixing novel Theatrical\nideas with a delightful 'potted'\nphilosophy. In 'Rosencrantz and\nGuildestern are Dead' the idea\nwas of a 'Hamlet' from the angle\nof the two attendant Lords, while\nhis The Real Inspector Hound'\ntook light-hearted jabs at every\ntheatrical institution from Critics\nto 'The Mousetrap'. Thus it is\nnot as easy to define his new\nfarcical and surrealistic play for\nthe National Theatre, 'Jumpers'\n(Old Vic).\nThe basis of this play is a witty philosophical discussion on\nthe question of the meanings, if\nany, of the words Good, Bad\nand God. This is effected in the\noral preparation of just such a paper by the central character\nGeorge (Richard Hordern), a University Professor of Moral\nPhilosophy and is illustrated by\nhis circumstances, which include\nhis ex-Star wife Dottie (Diana\nRigg), a murdered acrobat (one\nof the Jumpers \u2014 sort of\nGymnast-Philosophers), a consequent Ortonian Detective and\na Psychiatrist Vice-Chancellor. A great many extraordinary things\nhappen, for the play is set in a future in which a repressive\nRadical-Liberal part has just\nbeen elected and British astronauts have argued on the Moon,\nbut at the same time the form of\nthe play is tightly disciplined,\nand at all times invested with\nStoppard's subtle wit. The end\nis not entirely conclusive, for\nalthough reason shows that there\ncan be no God, a comparable\nline of logic shows that an arrow\nwill never reach its destination\n(and St Sebastian died of\nshock). 'Do not despair,' said\nthe quoted St Augustine 'one of\nthe thieves was saved'. Good\ndoes exist, philosophy or not.\nI cannot think of any play\nwith as enjoyable a philosophical content as this since\n'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern',\nfor on his chosen ground Mr.\nStoppard is unbeatable. The\nperformance of Michael Hordern, with his alternating airs of\nbewilderment and certainty, is\nsure to win awards, and Diana\nRigg is quite his foil. This play\nis seriously funny and is enjoyable on all planes, and is altogether most splendidly wrought.\n1 1 1 , . .\nis is if is iii is RAPE\u2014KUBRICK STYLE\nFilms\nThis issue I shall be taking a look at the career of one of my\nfavourite directors, Stanley\nKubrick. Stanley Kubrick has\nbeen directing, writing and producing films since 1956. He has\nproduced such a wide range of\nfilms that it is very difficult to\ncategorise him: he has produced\nsuch films as the terse thriller\n'The Killing' (1956): the antiwar 'Paths of Glory' (1958);\nthe epic 'Spartacus' (1960):\n'Lolita' (1962): the nuclear war\nfilm 'Dr. Strangelove' (1963):\nthe visually stunning '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1967) and\nfinally he has reached a peak\nwith his terrifying look at the\nnear future with 'A Clockwork\nOrange'.\nThe first film that convinced\nme of Kubrick's talent was '2001:\nA Space Odyssey'. This was the\nmost beautiful film I have seen.\n, Visually it was quite stunning,\nthe model work was excellent\nand the combined model-live\naction sequences are still not\nfully understood except by the\ntechnicians involved: there was\nalways something to attract the\neye. I won't dare attempt to\ninterpret the film; every time I see the film I interpret it in a slightly different way. The Killing' was another fine film, not\nin the same style as '200V, but\nit was elevated above the standard 50's thriller with an excellent\nscript by Kubrick. 'Spartacus'\ncould have been another multi-million dollar epic where the\ncast of thousands reduces the\nscript to links between the\naction sequences, but Kubrick\ndirected a human story of the\nrebel gladiator.\n'A Clockwork Orange' is perhaps the Stanley Kubrick film\nwhere many of the ideas in his\nprevious films come together to\nproduce a film with the pessimism in 'Dr. Strangelove' and\nparts of '2001' and the amorality\nof characters in many of his\nother films. The ultra-violence\nthat is shown is different from\nthat seen in other ultra-violent\nfilms such as Peckinpah's 'Straw\nDogs' one gets the impression\nof Kubrick as the scientist observing people as he would an\nexperiment with rats, whereas\nPeckinpah's violence was a much more subjective violence\ntrying to involve the viewer as\nmuch as possible. There are\nmany other touches to the film\nthat are typical of Kubrick; \u2014\nthe use of music as an integral\npart of the film\u2014this was seen\nin '2001'. Also the use of an irrelevant song during a very dramatic part of the film (e.g. 'We'll\nMeet Again' when the bomber\nwas on its way to attack Moscow in Dr. Strangelove: 'Daisy'\nsung by HAL when he was being im mobilised by Bowman in\n'2001' and finally 'Singin' in the\nRain' during the rape scene in\n'A Clockwork Orange') in all\nthese incidents the songs seem\nto be very trite but they only\ntend to heighten the dramatic\nimpact of the scene.\n'A Clockwork Orange' seen in\nthe context of his other films\nonly makes you realise how\nmuch talent Stanley Kubrick has\nas a writer-producer-director and\nI hope that we don't have to wait\nanother four years before we\ncan see his next film.\nDiscs\nPaul Simon \"Paul Simon\" ( CBS) I must admit that I have never made much attempt\nto get into the music of Simon and Garfunkel, or Simon\nand Gutrot as I and my musically retarded school friends used to call them as we freaked to Steppenwolf and\nJimi Hendrix. But this record is extremely good\u2014I wonder if that is because this is the first album that\nI 've had to listen to attentively, (because of my devotion to duty) or because this album is so much more\nnoticeable than the previous S. and G. albums. The\nrange of music covered on this album is much broader\nthan the largely acoustic guitar-orientated songs on\nprevious albums, at least before \"Bridge over Troubled\nWater\". The first track on the album \"Mother and Child\nReunion\" which you may have heard as it has been released as a single, is a reggae song, pure and simple,\nrecorded in Kingston, Jamaica, but differing from the\nusual reggae in that the words are not just about the\nbenefits of the banana (whoops my prejudice is show-ing). The second song, \"Duncan\", my favourite at the\nmoment, has a rather sarcastic edge:\u2014 \"Couple in the\nnext room/Bound to win a prize/They've been going at\nit all night long/Well I'm trying to get some sleep/But\nthese motel wall are cheap\" but it does seem to have\na happy ending:\u2014 \"Just later on the very same night/\nWhen I crept to her tent with a flashlight/And my long\nyears of innocence ended/Well, she took me to the\nwoods/Saying here comes something and it feels so\ngood/And just like a dog I was befriended..' That was\nrecorded in Paris. Simon has obviously travelled about\na bit looking for the best means of expressing his\nsongs. Also recorded in Paris is a lovely little number\ncalled Hobo's Blues featuring Simon duet ting with\nveteran jazz violinist Stephane Grapelli. \"Run That\nBody Down\" features wha-wha guitar and on a track\ncalled \"Papa Hobo\" there is even a sound like that of\na synthesizer. Actually the sound is made by a harmonium and a bass harmonica, but it does show how he is\nbranching out. Perhaps on the next album he really will\nbe using a synthesizer.\nStefan Grossman's bottleneck guitar on \"Paranoia\nBlues\" is a sheer delight and on this track Simon again\nshows that his garden is not free of weeds:\u2014 \"I 've got\nsome so-called friends/They'll smile right to my face/\nBut when my back is turned/They'd like to stick it to\nme/Yes they would/ Oh no no, Oh no no/There's only one thing I'd like to know/Whose side are you on\". I should like to print out all the lyrics (not easy padding these reviews out to 500 words you know) for the\nbenefit of people who take an interest in such things,\nas they are printed on the sleeve.\nThis album is great and so I will spend the rest of\nmy life checking out on old Simon and Garfunkel\nalbums in hope of finding something as good as this.\nPaul Simon\n\n"

It\ncomes perhaps rather late\nfor the third year students\nwho are currently attending interviews and who are\nprobably well aware of the\nfacilities mentioned here-in. It is also possibly too\nearly for first year students\nwho will not be involved in\nthe job hunt yet, but I hope it will help the\nsecond year students who\nare not yet giving consideration to the problems\nof employment which\nawait them.\nThere is no point in trying to hide the fact that\nthe employment situation\nhas deteriorated rapidly\nduring the past eighteen\nmonths and that present\nday graduates will not find\nit easy to obtain a job on\nleaving the College.\nAt Imperial College\nthere is a member of the\nacademic staff in each department who is a member\nof the Sub Committee of\nthe Appointments Board\nof the College. Any stu-dent, first, second and\nthird year, or postgraduate\ncan consult his departmental representative who will\ngive as much advice and\nassistance as possible\nconcerning employment,\nbut before consulting him\nthe students may wish to\nexplore for themselves the\nopportunities which exist.\nThere are several publications which can be of\ngreat help to a student\nwho requires career information. Among these is\nthe 'Directory of Opportunities for Graduates' which\nis published by the Cornmarket Careers Centre\nLtd. This book gives information about a large number of firms and organisations who have an interest\nin recruiting graduates,\nand reference to this book\nwill answer a lot of the\nquestions which occur to\nall job hunters. On similar\nlines is another book from\nClassic Publications Ltd.\n'Professional Careers for\nGraduate Scientists and\nEngineers', and yet another book 'G.O.72' has\nrecently appeared.\nThese books are excellent in giving students\nideas and information concerning companies but\nthey still do not supply the\nwhole answer to the question \"What type of job can\nI get when I graduate\".\nMany firms this year\nhave curtailed their re-cr u it ment, to the dismay of\nthose students who had\nhoped to enter industry\nthrough one of the well\nknown industrial organisations, and it is often necessary to look in other directions for ideas.\nFor the student who\nwishes to use his degree\nin wider fields there are\nopenings which are perhaps not readily appreciated, such as Accountancy, Banking, Insurance,\nthe City, the Armed Servies and the Police, to\nname but a few. One year\na student entered a Monastery after graduation but\nhe, of course, was an ex-ce pti on. A good guide to\nthese wider fields is a publication issued by the\nCareers Research and Advisory Centre entitled\n\"Beyond a Degree\" which\nis available for reference\nfrom the departmental\nrepresentative or from the\nCareers Library Room 303,\nlevel 3, College Block.\nThe College Appointments Board has strong\nlinks with the University of\nLondon Careers Advisory\nService and advantage has\nbeen taken of the Field\nOfficer Service operated\nby ULCAS. Mr. Peter Ashworth, a senior officer in\nthe Service, visits the College two or three times a week throughout the year\nto help students make decisions about careers and,\nin many cases, to help put\nthem in touch with possible employers. Any students wishing to see the\nField Officer should first\nconsult their departmental\nrepresentatives.\nEach year, the College\nAppointments Board arranges for a series of\ncareers talks to be given\nduring Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes during the\nAutumn term. These talks,\nwhich are held in one of\nthe lecture theatres in College Block, are given by\nleading men and women\nin various occupational\nfields. Opportunity is given\nat the end of each talk for\nquestions and much valuable information can be\nobtained. Students of all\nyears are cordially invited\nto attend.

He is probably\nthe best instructor in Great\nBritain at present. Sensei\nEnoeda, 6th Dan black\nbelt is at present chief instructor for the Japanese\nKarate Association, in\nGreat Britain. He was all-Japan-Champion in 1963-1964 and World Champion\nalso in '63. Since then he\nhas devoted his time to\nthe instruction and improvement of Karate.\nBesides Sensei Enoeda,\nwe have two very able\nbrown belts, the captain\nand treasurer who can\nprovide invaluable tuition\nfor any person of the same\nstandard or lower. Indeed\nfrom the instruction that is\navailable, any beginner\n(like myself) should be\nable to proceed rapidly to\na very high standard within a year.\nHowever, despite the excellent facilities available,\nit is still a hard sport, demanding a lot of strength,\nstamina and mental effort\nas in any other specialist\nfield where one has to\nstrive for perfection. These\nqualities are soon de ve loped. At first the training\nis quite basic. Suppleness\nof limbs and body is developed with special exercises at the beginning of\neach session. This is then\nfollowed by basic body\nmovements in karate\nwhich include punching,\nkicking, blocking etc. The\nsession usually ends with\npractice of fighting techniques and kata\u2014a series\nof movements requiring\ndelicate balance and\ngraceful execution. All this-is practised at the Union\nGym every Wednesday\n1.15\u20142.15 p.m. In addition,\ninformal training periods\noccur on Thursday lunch\nbreaks.\nThe sport is cheap at College\u201450p for entry now\n\u2014and suits are loaned by\nthe club. (Average prices\nof external instruction\nrange from \u00a38\u2014\u00a312 per\nannum and also 50p per\nsession).\nAny male or female who\nis interested in our flourishing activities will be\nvery welcome at the Union\nGym. Or contact C. Brown,\nPhysics I. than rows of empty seats.\nProgrammes of the talks\nwill be widely distributed\nafter the summer vacation.\nHaving used the various\naids and having decided\nwhat types of jobs to try\nfor, the next question is\n\"How do I obtain such a job\".\nThe Appointments Board publishes lists each\nAutumn showing the firms\nwho will be visiting the\nCollege in the Spring term\nto interview applicants for\nemployment. These lists\nare available through the\ndepartmental representatives and are accompanied\nby forms for registering for\ninterviews.\nThe Careers Library in\nCollege Block will have\ncopies of many firms brochures for distribution and\nstudents are recommended to study this literature.\nAt this point it is probably relevant to offer some\nadvice concerning the interviews which has been\ngathered from talks with a number of interviewers.\na) Be punctual for your\ninterviews. The interviewer is working to a tight timetable and im-punctuality can result\nin an unsatisfactory in-ter view, in which the\nstudent does not do\nhimself justice.\nb) Be well groomed. This\ndoes not call for any\nfurther comment.\nc) If you have been provided with an application form, complete it\nwith care and have it\navailable when request-ed. Some firms will use\npre-selection methods\nfor which early return\nof a form is necessary.\nIf a date for the return\nof the form is stipulated\nit is advisable to keep\nto it.\nd) Read the company\nliterature before the\ninterview and have\nsome idea of the vacancy for which you are\napplying. Interviewers\nare not very willing to\nrepeat information\nwhich is already fully\ncovered in their firm's brochure, neither do\nthey warm to the student who has no idea\nwhat he wants to do\nwithin the firm.\ne) Don't be too modest.\nYou have to \"sell\"\nyourself and you cannot expect the inter-viewer, however expert\nhe may be, to \"draw\"\nyou all the time. If you\nhave done something\nwhich you consider\nnoteworthy work this\nfact into the con versa tion. It may be the turning point in your favour.\nAll of these do's and\ndon'ts make job seeking\nappear difficult; it is, but\nyou can be assured that\nthe Appointments Board\nrepresentatives will do all\nthey can to help you.\nFinally, don't ignore the\ndaily press advertisements.\nThe Appointments Board\ndoes not hear of every job\noffer and some firms may\nnot even have heard of the\nAppointments Board.\nAs there may be some\ndoubt as to the identity of\nyour Appointments Board\ndepartmental representative the following is the\ncomplete list.\nAeronautics \u2014 Mr. F.L.

I hope\nyou enjoyed sampling the mags I reviewed last time,\nand haven't spent too agonizing a fortnight waiting for\nthis little batch of literary political gems.\nThis week political down and follows the party\npapers are the object of\nmy attentions both left and\nright-wing ones. All I shall\nsay about the dailies is just\na brief run-down as follows :\nRIGHT-WING: \"Telegraph\"\n\u2014 favourite of a popular\nsub warden and of a decidedly fascist nature.\nGood for determined capitalists (like me) who like\na no-nonsense biased view\nof current politics and love\nTed (unlike me). \"Daily\nExcess\" is just that. \" Mail\" \u2014 tabloid Excess. \"Times\"\nis usually boring, but has\noccasional and unpredictable revolutionary out-bursts.\nLEFT-WING: \" Guardian\" \u2014\neveryone knows that it's the ultimate in British daily\npapers, whatever your\npoint of view .\"Mirror\"\ndoesn't bear looking in.\n\"Morning Star\" is opposite\nof Telegraph.\nNOWHERE: \" Sun\" \u2014 yes,\nthere are 2 J million statisticians in the country. The\nEditor doesn't know what\n\"political\" means.\nSUNDAYS: In a class by\nthemselves. \" S. Times\" is\ngood but massive and ex-pensive. \"Observer\" \u2014\nghastly. \"Express\" as if\nyou haven't had enough\nExcesses during the week.\n\"Sunday People\" \u2014 no,\nthe new name doesn't improve it. \"Mirror\" \u2014 no\ncomment. \"Telegraph\" \u2014\nlike the daily with added\nPeregrine Worsthorne (if\nhis name doesn't put you\noff, try reading one of his\narticles ! ) . \" News of\nt 'World\" \u2014 I'm lost for\nwords.\nNow to the weeklies,\nwhich is what I'm really interested in. I 've deliberately left out some of the\n'progressives' \u2014 most of\nyou read one or more of\nthem regularly anyway,\nand you wouldn't appreciate any real criticism I made of them. In \"British\nRate and Data\", the Bible\nof publications, \" Oz\", for\ninstance, coming under the\nsub-heading of 'Teenage\nand Pop mags' is sandwiched between \"Fabulous\n208\" and \"Petticoat\" \u2014\nand that's where it can\nstay. The \" Red Mole\" can\nbe recommended to young\nrevolutionaries, whereas\n\"Ink\" can't be recommended to anyone.\nI may as well start with\nthe only Right-wing weekly\nof any note, i.e. the \"Spec-tat or\". It is, however, by\nno means a paper that sits\nline, and indeed backs up\nits claim to be outspoken.\nRather more so than its direct competitor in the left-wing sector, the \" New Statesman\", which can be\nrelied upon to follow the\nline at least 20 per cent of\nthe time. The \"Statesman\"\ntends, however, to knock\nthe Labour party leadership on many matters. Al though nothing like as old-established as the \"Spec-tat or\", which has been\ngoing since 1828, the\n\"New Statesman\" is still\nquite an old stage r, since\nit has existed in one form\nor another since the beginning of the century.\nBut if you want pure, un-adulterated, strict party\nline Labourism from a paper, try the \"Labour\nWeekly\", which this week\njust runs into its 21st issue.\nIt makes comforting reading for Labour party mem-be rs, yet is probably as\nodious as Toryism to progressive Socialists. Unlike\nthe Spectator and Statesman it is all political com-ment, and does not, like\nthe two latter publications,\ntake up half its space with\nreviews. (Incidentally, and\na politically, the Statesman\nis probably the most cruel\ncritic of the arts in print\ntoday, and well worth reading \u2014\u2022 but take it with a pinch of salt).\nThe Socialist version of\n\"Labour Weekly\" has been\ngoing for rather more than\n21 issues \u2014 more like 36\nyears, in fact! It's name is\n\"Tribune\", and it's the\noriginal ' revolutionist '\nweekly. Also, unlike all its\nrecent imitators (e.g. \"Red\nMole\", \"Ink\", \" 7 Days\") it\nis widely read and taken\nas an authority by all politicians and political com-ment at or s. Add to that the\nfact that it's usually written in correct English\ngrammar, contains real\nfacts, and costs only half\nas much as the others, and\nit becomes plain that it is\nstill the best weekly for\nSocialists. There's even a cheap rate for students.\nIt's only intelligent competitor these days is a new\npaper (only 15 issues)\ncalled \" 7 Days\", which is\nshowing terrific promise. It\n'is printed superbly for a weekly political, but unfortunately they do charge a lot for it. If it survives despite this, as it should, I predict that in 2008, when\nit is as old as \"Tribune\" is\nnow, it will be at least as\nThe Cooking Pot\nSi, II is tool ish to slate, as Angus Older does\nVeil\n/ labour weekly\" over 20 year's,t am convinced that the Porto- s \u201e , I*>< \u00bb or ,? f*o3? \"\u00bb\nsoldier-cum-set tlc r of today is as much\ncourage d to misc e gen ate as his counter-part\nwas in (he levies of settlers during the 16th century. Moreover, I have first-hand knowledge\nthat a propensity for multi-racial is m cuts\nacross political convictions. The equation made\nin the United States and Britain bei we en multi-racial is m and democracy, strikes me as naive,\nand (he inability to understand the situations in\nBrazil and Portugal would appear to be an\nextension of ingrained cultural prejudices.\nAntonio de Figueiredo32 Upper Richmond Road\nLondon SWJ4\n^Irish Wrongs\n, Christj\nAI\n-BUT\n.vs.\n\"CaW v'i\"<0\" ws\"5\" one\" \u201e,i*i*' j \u00ab\u00ab'\n- n sec\nic.^\n.

Now for\nthree that don't. The first\ntwo are \"world\" maga-zines, based in the U.S., which are both Conservative, one more so than the\nother. However, you might\nstill enjoy them if you're a Communist. (They have\nlarge pictures of Nixon\nsuitable for dart-boards). I need hardly tell you that\nI'm talking about \"Time\"\n\u2014 the Democrat (NOT\ndemocratic) one \u2014 and\n\"Newsweek\", the Republican one. Expensive but\nglossy.\nThe third is the \"Guard-ian Weekly\", which is just\na condensed version of the\nprevious week's dailies.\nAlthough primarily intended for export, if you have\nonly time to read one\npaper a week and want\nboth facts and comment,\nboth of the informed and\n'sensible' variety, you\nreally can't do better.\nYou'll probably have to\norder it, but you can take\nmy word for it that it's worth it.\nWell, that's it for this\ntime. I hope that you'll\nspend a few hours exploring political papers \u2014\u2022\nyou'll find quite a number\nthat I haven't mentioned\nwhich may suit you better.\nRapidly turning my back\non political publications,\nI'm going to spend the next\nfortnight wading through\nsome \"Glossies\" (e.g. \"Country Life\", \"Tatler\",\netc.), and I 'll report back\nto you in a fortnight's time.\nHappy browsing !\nChinese\nTechnology\nA year or so ago Mr. Anthony\nWedgwood Benn was invited to\nspend 12 days in mainland\nChina to see the progress of\nChinese Technology under Communist rule. He was at Imperial\nby invitation of THIRD WORLD\nFIRST \u2014 UNSA to recount his\nexperiences.\nBefore enlightening us upon\nthe advances in Chinese Technology, Mr. Wedgwood Benn\nasked us first to bear in mind\ntwo points about China's historical development. Firstly that this\ncountry is the only one in the\nworld that has developed without foreign aid. (It did receive\nvery limited Soviet aid until\n1960). Its progress has been\nremarkable and even its strongest critics now admit that starvation has been virtually eliminated in spite of the development\nof advanced rocketry and the\nH bomb. Compare this with the\nrest of Asia for the similar\nperiod.\nSecondly, one has to remember that China's immediate history has been one of complete\nupheaval. During the 19th century there were Opium Wars followed by foreign colonisation\nand the 1920's saw the start of\na civil war, which has continued,\napart from the interruption of\nthe Japanese invasion during the\nsecond world war, to the present\nday with the nationalist occupation of Formosa.\nAt this point, he was careful\nto point out that just as Western\ncivilisation does not work in the\nEast, one could also assume the\nopposite. So whilst our fears of\ninvasion by hordes of Chinese\nwere allayed, he tried to explain\nthe motives and results of the\n'Cultural Revolution'. Mao Tse\nTung had realised that the Communist Revolution of 1949 had\nmerely traded one form of bureaucracy for another instead of\ninstituting communism in its real\nsense. In true Confucian t radi tion, the Chinese call this former type of Communism, 'Cap-it al is m'. This, they recognise,\nexists in the Soviet Union, hence\nthe split from Soviet Communism. Mao is acutely conscious\nthat the 'class struggle' does not\ncease with the transfer of power\nand expects that true communism will flourish in about 300\nyears time.\nOne of the biggest changes\nthat has occurred in China, is in\nthe educational system. Mao fer-.\nvent ly believes that education\nshould be used for the benefit\nof the state. To this end, instead\nof separating education from\nwork, he tries to integrate it as\nmuch as possible. For instance\nchildren at primary and secondary schools do light manual\nwork for about 1 or 2 hours a day in addition to their studies.\nAfter secondary school, everyone works and then the workers\ndecide amongst themselves who\nwill go to university at the age\nof twenty. All courses at university are of the sandwich type\nand the lecturers are normally\nfactory workers who come to\nlecture on their problems in fac-tories, etc. Compare this with\nthe USA where higher education has reached absurd proportions, can a post doctoral qualification in journalistic photography solve racial, pollution or\npoverty problems?\n'What', asked an aspiring\nmember of the audience, 'will\nbecome of all those budding\nChinese genii who will be stifled\nby this education system?'\nMr. Wedgwood Benn replied\nthat in all cases great inventors\nhave been ordinary workers and\nthat any country that invents\nmore than it can use, e.g. Britain, is being wasteful and only\nincreasing national pride!\nMao decided that the order of\nChinese development should be\nagriculture, light industry, heavy\nindustry. In this way (as every\nbudding ecologist knows) unemployment is kept at a low level\nby using people as a resource.\nWherever industry is enc our aged, a commune approach is\nadopted and the traditional managerial structure (as it exists in\nthe Soviet Union) is rejected,\nas they believe it is potentially\ncorrupt. One only has to look at\nindustrial Kibbutz in Israel to\nsee how well this approach\nworks in underdeveloped co un tries.\nMao is always worried about\nthe disconnection of those who\nrule from those who produce. In\nhis rule as leader of the Chinese\npeople, he leaves Chou En Lai\nto run the state while he sees\nhimself as a teacher or 'a lonely\nold monk walking through life\nwith a leaky umbrella'.\nB.C. W. Union President, JOHN McCULLOUGH, speaks\nICU has now submitted 7 motions to NUS for the Easter National\nConference in Birmingham. Just before going through the motions,\nit might be best to say that the basic reasons why we submit\nmotions to NUS are threefold\u2014to get the NUS executive to do\nsomething, to get individual constituent organisations to do something or to bring our point of view at least to the notice of others.\nSo what are we spouting off about this time?\nWomens Lib\u2014basically a statement of our belief in equality for\nwomen. We are asking C.O.'s to set up women's groups to campaign and make available contraceptives, abortions, etc. to their\nown women students.\nStudent Wage\u2014the NUS has agreed in principle to the concept\nof a student wage. If one takes as a basis that education is a right of everyone, then people participating of education ought to\nbe paid to be able to further that education. By campaigning for\nstudent wages we are strongly campaigning against student loans.\nOur motion asks for the setting up of a working party to prepare an\nanalysis of all the problems and implications associated with the\nStudent Wage concept and for the Executive to plan ahead in detail for the second and third stages of the campaign, i.e. putting\nover the arguments to our membership and then to the Government.\nEntrance to Higher Education\u2014this motion calls for a new initiative in the field of schools/Student Union liaison. Activity within\nIC has been growing in terms of meeting interviewees etc. within\nthe last couple of years and now USK, in co-ordination with the\nlocal Trades Council, is hoping to participate within an Open Day\nat a local Grammar School. The motion calls on areas (like U.S.K.) to organise a rota of visits to local schools, too make initial contacts in schools with a view to encouraging the formation of\nschools' Unions and calls on the NUS executive to produce a leaflet for national distribution to 6th former s, enumerating student\nUnion contacts so that 6th former s can contact students in College before choosing their paths into Higher Education.\nEducational Philosophy\u2014The James Report that has just been published favours a sectional is ed system of higher education. The\nNUS for a long time has in general terms favoured a Comprehensive, anti-binary, University system. Our motion tries to state this\nideal in practical terms.\nEnvironment\u2014Our motion calls for NUS support on a broad level\nfor the pri c ip les embodied in the \"Blueprint for Survival\" publica-tion. It also calls on the NUS to demand full representation in\ntalks on implementation of Rothschild and Painton reports, believing that Research is a subject closely linked to the Environment.\nEntertainments\u2014The NUS passed a motion at Margate in the\nAutumn calling for Ents Committees to book groups on a percentage basis. Unfortunately, this only works to our advantage if this\npercentage is a percentage of the profits and not the gross takings\n(Rubbish\u2014Ed.) and until all Unions work in unison on this one\nwe will get nowhere.\nAny comments?\u2014come in and seem me sometime and tell me\nwhat else you think we ought to be talking about within NUS.\nAbout the time you read this we will be deciding which amendments we will be putting in.\nIN FACT, although I 've tried to say it n times before, unless\npeople come into the Union office and tell us what they want us\nto do, or what we're doing wrong, we'll never know . . .\n\n"

    "content": "UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE RECOUNT DEMANDED IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 24 February 1972 No. 309\nA Weekly Felix?\nThose of you who remember my first editorial of the\nyear, few in number no doubt, will recall my feelings as\nregards the restructuring of I.C.U. publications. Basically I asked for the numerous diverse publications\nwhich I.C.U. producer such as I.C. News, the constituent\ncollege broadsheets, Snapping Jaws, etc. to all be\ncombined into one good publication which would be\nworth the money it would cost and probably be cheaper\nthan the total cost of all the other publications anyway.\nTo my joy there is now a positive hope that all of this\ncould come to pass.\nLast Monday a motion went\nbefore council, proposed by\neither Rob Armitage or Dave\nHobman, probably the former,\nsuggesting that Felix be made\nweekly and incorporate other\nICU publications. Unfortunately\nat the time of going to press\nthe above mentioned council\nmeeting had not taken place and\nso I am unable to tell you the\noutcome of the proposal.\nWhilst the motion appeared to\nhave extensive support throughout IC council members before\nit was proposed, it has many\nmore far reaching consequences\nthan I think the majority of\ncouncil members had realised.\nIt is my purpose to put these\nforward at the council meeting\nso as the students of the College may be similarly enlightened and so be placed in the position to judge the issue for themselves and forcefully voice their\nopinions if they feel its necessary, I would also like to put\n\u2022.hern forward here.\nFirstly, the Editor of a weekly\nFelix must be sabbatical. There\nare many other officials of ICU\nwho will feel that their position\nshould be made sabbatical before the Editor of Felix, but\nthere are not many who can\nclaim that to make their post\nsabbatical would be an invest-ment. A weekly Felix must be\nable to be on the newstands\nwithin at most 48 hours of\nleaving for press. Whilst printers who can handle this kind of\nwork would need to be investigated further printing costs per\nissue cannot be expected to be\nmuch less than \u00a3100. Multiplication by 31 produces a large\namount of money. This money\ncould only be recovered by extensive advertising, which can\nonly be obtained by means of a great deal of time consuming\nwork. The present annual incomes to Felix from advertising\nis approximately \u00a3350. A little\nthought will soon show that the\ncost of \u00a3465 per annum for a sabbatical Editor will soon be\nreplenished. There are, of\ncourse, two other important\nconsiderations (a) that no-one\nwould be Editor unless it were\na sabbatical post, as too much\nwork would be involved, (b) The content of Felix must be\nimproved by a sabbatical\nEditor.\nSecondly, we must examine\nthe differences between the proposed new Felix and the present one. At present I do not\neditorial\ncomment feel that for the purpose it\nserves in ICU Felix warrants its\nannual grant of \u00a3800. It does not\nmanage to include most of the\nimportant Union news and is\ntoo understaffed to function as\na useful news medium in any\nsense. Indeed it is little more\nthan an interesting magazine.\nBy the same token none of the\nother I.C.U. publications is really\nworth the money it costs either\nand some of them not even the\npaper they are written on. If\nwe put all our eggs into one\nbasket then we will be having a paper worth having. For the\nfirst time we will have a medium\nin I. C.U.I cannot emphasise too\nstrongly the importance of\nthese proposals. The only alternative to this campaign to remove the reams of rubbishy\nprint from our waste bins is the\nproposed scheme for STOIC.\nHowever the only decision here\nis to want to get your message\nto 3,000 people or to 200. What\nI am trying to build is a medium\nfor all. Please give it your sup-port. Write to your President\nnow. The issue comes before\nPublications Board next week.\nFELIX SAVES HOB MAN Without doubt, the Union meeting of two weeks ago\nwas one of the most important to have occurred this\nterm. The advance publicity was better this time, with\nthe issue of no-confidence in the Hon. Sec. being highlighted in Felix, this article undoubtedly influencing the\nvote later in the proceedings.\nThis, together with the possibility of money being voted\nfrom Union funds to the miners,\nmust have brought a considerable number of those people\nwho came. There were about\n450 present, many of whom\nseemed enthusiastically committed to a particular view-point\nand had only come to vote for\nor against the relevant issues.\nAs a result of this the order\non the agenda was changed to\nallow discussion of the miners\ncase first and then the vote of\nno-confidence. These changes\nwere vigour ou sly opposed by\nthe President and eventually a vote had to be taken to settle\nthe issue.\nBefore these motions could\nbe discussed, however, the election of delegates to the next\nNUS conference had to be con-clude d.D. Amos and R. Armitage were automatically elected\nas the two newcomers but a vote was necessary to decide\nupon the remaining four. Six\npeople had put their names for-ward, these being P. Corbybn,\nD, Hobman, J. McCullough, J. Murliss, P. Ransom, O Sheppard. Each was allowed to talk\nfor a few minutes on why he\nshould be allowed to go.\nPiers was concerned that\nNUS might back down from\ntheir policy on Union Autonomy\nand felt that the fight against\nthe government must be con-tin u ed. He also rejected the allegation by the President that he\nhad spoken against Union man-dates-Dave Hobman was principally\nconcerned with the right of\neducation for everyone and was\nequally concerned that Mr. Corbyn should not be allowed to go\nas he had broken mandates in\nthe past with every possibility\nof him continuing to do so in\nthe future.\nChris Sheppard, who suddenly seems to have appeared out\nof the blue, wanted to go deliberately un specialised so that he\ncould talk on any issue that\noccurred. Too often, he said,\ndid delegates find themselves\nwith nothing to say when their\nparticular topic had been drop-ped.\nThe result of the ballot taken\nat the meeting resulted in P. Corbyn and P. Ransom being\ndropped, however, it appears\nthat Mr. Corbyn is again going\nto appeal against the voting s ys tem.\nAfter this came the item\nwhich everyone had been waiting for, the motion concerning\nthe miners strike. The version\nproposed by the executive asked for a day of solidarity to be\narranged and for a collection\nto be made.\nMr. Jack Dunn, the general\nsecretary of the NUM in Kent,\nhad come to give information\nabout the strike and proceeded\nto give a lengthy speech on the\nsubject. This went over fairly\nwell and the general impression\nwas that people felt sympathy\nfor the cause without wanting\nto use it as a weapon against\nthe government.\nPiers Corbyn soon found this\nout when he proposed his\namendment which had such\nphrases as \"victory for the miners strike means that the Governments 7 per cent pay norm\nwill be broken\". In order to\nshow solidarity with the cause,\nhe was convinced that the\nUnion must pay some money\n(\u00a3100) into the strike fund. This,\nin particular, was vigorously\nshouted down.\nPete Jenkins opposed the\namendment on grounds that is\nwas dangerous for student unions to use their money for political causes, and that the money\nshould be spent on students\nonly. If anything any money\nFOR GOD'S SAKE\nGROW UP!

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX Thursday, 24th February, 1972\nRAG\nCONCERT It was, as Steve Marriott\nprobably said, a diabolical\nliberty. He had just been\nrefused admission for the\nthird time, and had had to\nswallow his modesty and\ntell the doormen that he\nwas indeed yer actual loo-ner Mad Marriott. The nine\nto twelve power cut did not\nhelp matters and those in\ncharge of admission did a grand job in very trying\ncircumstances. Meanwhile\nback at the ball (s up)\neveryone had a good time,\ntaking advantage of the\nanonymity imposed by\ndarkness to do fun things\nlike smashing windows\nand dropping flowerpots\nfrom great heights to see\nwhat happened. Now folks\nI can announce the result.\nThe flower pots broke into\nlittle pieces which were\neagerly cleared up by the\nsix or so people who stayed to clear up, finishing at\n7.30 on Saturday evening,\njust in time for the Ents\nconcert. People also contrived to relieve themselves in the most imaginative\nplaces, not for them the\ndull rut of using a lavatory.\nStill, drinking is great fun,\nI'm sure they enjoyed\nthemselves and that was\nwhat it was all about.\nUnfortunately, I didn't get to see films, or Dando\nShaft, who came on after\nHumble Pie, or Al Stewart\nwho played in a very crowded J. C.R. but I gather all\nwere well received. I think\neveryone will agree that\nthe groups were chosen to\nappeal to the greatest\nnumbers. Most people had\nof course come to see\nHumble Pie, but the receptions accorded to Wild Angels and Hookfoot showed\nthat they had plenty of fans\nthere too. The ever-pop u lar Miss Linda Lewis began with a set similar to\nher last one here (see issue 307). Nuff said. Wild\nAngels came on next, and\nall the greasers stood up\nto be counted. To be honest I thought they were\nawful but I didn't like the\noriginals of the songs they\nrecreate very much, although they did it with\nadmirable fidelity. But Big\nDeal! Why not dig out\nsome dusty 78s and play\nthem, for a fraction of the\ncost. The only original part\nof the act was an excellent\ndrum solo, but what a pity\nthat such musicians are\nwasted in a group like\nthis.\nThen came Hookfoot. It\nreally beats me why they\nhave never made it big.\nCaleb Quaye is an excellent guitarist in a Zappaish sort of way, and I reckon he could make the\nguitar come when he called it. He was getting married the following day so\nthis was a great night to\nlet it all out, which he did.\nEspecially good was a version of Neil Young's 'Ohio'\nand their new single,\n'Sweet Funky Music',\nwhich just about sums the\ngroup up, although come\nto think of it I 've never\nworked out what that word\nfunky means. The group\nwere visibly bucked by\ntheir reception but unfortunately time did not permit an encore.\nSteve Marriott eventually impressed his identity\non the doormen and Humble Pie took the stage at\n1.15, all systems go and\nsod the power cuts( quote). Launching straight into 'Four Day\nCreep' they soon had the\ncrowd on their feet. Highlight of the ace was, as\nusual, Steve Marriott's narrative on 'Rolling Stone',\nabout the chick in Manchester and her mother\nwho had designs on him,\nand how every time he\nwent to her house she\nmade him eat lots of sand-wi che s, and other interesting bits which space and\ngood taste do not permit\nmy enlarging on.\nThe group announced\nthe arrival of their new\nL.P., 'Smokin' ' and played\na song from it about\npeaches or something. It\nshould be a winner. If I 've\ngiven the impression that\nHumble Pie are the Steve\nMarriott show then I'd better rewrite this review, but\nas it is now 7 o 'clock Sunday I shall tag on the condolences to Dave Clempson, Greg Ridley and Jerry\nShirley. Clem must like\nhaving so much freedom\nafter his rather restricted\nexistence with Collosseum\n\u2014it's almost like the days\nof Bakerloo again. Greg\nRidley has the most soulful voice of the three singers and Jerry Shirley is\none of the heaviest drummers around, but doesn't need any ego-tripping\nsolos to prove how good\nhe is. The group played\nabout three encores and\nfinally left at about 2.30.\nI picked my way over broken bottles, recumbent\nbodies and other garbage\nand headed for home, determined to become a tee-to taller.

C.1st XV played\nGoldsmiths in the long\nawaited 2nd round cup\ngame and emerged victorious by 13 points to 9.\nI.C. started strongly but\nfound themselves 3 points\nadrift when the Goldsmiths\nfly-half kicked a penalty\nafter an infringement. However the deficit was soon\nmade up after a superb\npeel, when I.C. were awarded a penalty. Chris\nFlanagan, thinking quickly,\nfed James who sent Jim\nHunt over in the corner.\nThe conversion failed,\nneedless to say. I.C. pressed strongly for the rest of\nthe first half and should\nhave scored on numerous\noccasions but the final\npass always seemed to go\nastray and as the score at\nhalf-time stood at 4 points\nto 3 in I.C's favour.\nThe second half opened\nas the first, with I.C. on\nthe attack and soon increased that when James\nkicked a penalty. I.C. continued to press and were\nsuitably rewarded when\nfrom a line-out the ball\nwas well won by the pack\nand Chris Flanagan sent\nout a superb pass giving\nthe I.C. backs room in\nwhich to move. The ball\nmoved between the centres and John Hughes,\ntiming his run from fullback to perfection made\nthe initial break to send\nPhil Lofts over for a try.\nJames converted.\nGoldsmiths came back\ninto the game and scored\na late try and the final few\nminutes were tense but\nI.C. held out and face\nKings in the semi final.\nTeam:\nJ.

Beats Bradford\nin Close Match\nJust before the start of\nthe first race, our captain\ntold us: \"Pair off before\nthe start if you can\". Unfortunately, on the start\ngun Mike Martin and crew\nJ. Horsfall were nowhere\nto be seen, and so we\nstarted at a disadvantage.\nAfter some devious sailing\nby the rest of our team, we\nmanaged to sail into a winning combination. However, our captain had not,\nfor reasons better known\nto himself, fully explained\nthe exact location of the\nfinishing line and the opposition demanded a re-sail.\nThe following race did\nnot produce any better a start\u2014it would appear that\nsomeone's starting watch\nwas malfunctioning or\nsomething. After a bit of\ntrue team - racing we\nmanaged to gain a2,3,6, from 2, 5, 6 at the first\nmark which unfortunately\nwas not a winning comb in ation.\nThe third race started\nafter lunch and the three\nI.C. boats were all in the\nvicinity of the line, but even\nso Bradford had the better\nstart. S. Bascoe, crewed\nby Paul Jones, produced\nsome useful sailing for a change, and helped Peter\nWaite and Mike Martin to\nsail through two Bradford\nboats to give a2,3,4, at\nthe final leeward mark.\nThe leading Bradford boat\nthen had an impossible\ntask to hold all three I.C. boats back and eventually\nsacrificed his first position\nin an attempt to help his\nteam-mates to sail into a winning combination. The\nfinal result was 2, 3, 6 and\n1, 2, 4 to give I.C. the\nmatch.\nI should like to say that\nI.C. are very desperate to\nattract keen crews to sail\nin weekend matches, and\nanyone who would like to\nbe considered should see\nM. Martin in Keogh 266.\nR.C.S. Shoot Guilds\nOn Sunday, 6th February, the annual big-bore\nrifle match between R.C.S. and Guilds took place at\nBisley. It was planned for\nteams of eight, best six\nscores to count, but because of the horrible weather only five of each\nScores were as follows:\nside turned up, some of\nwhom were very late. We\neventually started at 300\nyards, managed one detail,\nsandwiches and a pint.\nAfter lunch, we finished off at 300, then mob-ed back to 600 yards.\nFiring only seven shots at\neach distance, we still\ncontinued firing until darkness produced some very\nwild shots\u2014bad luck Paul\nJordan and Mick Anderson for being in the last\ndetail!

In the previous rounds\nwe disposed of King's College Hospital 9-0, Royal\nFree Hospital 1-0, and met\nBarts Hospital in the semi-final.\nAs our only defeat by a college side this season\nwas by Barts a tough\nmatch was expected. On a wet but true surface at\nMotspur Park the game\nstarted with both sides\npressing for early supremacy. After 20 minutes I.C. gradually took control and\nJohn Astley converted this\npressure into a deserved\nlead. A brilliant save by\ntheir goalkeeper from a Steve Tucker flick stopped\nI.C. from going into a20 lead by half-time.\nPlaying downhill in the\nsecond half a short corner\nby Steve Tucker put I.C. further into the lead. Our\nsuccess was short lived\nand after 20 minutes of\nsustained attacking Barts\nWe have been hearing about the invincibility of I.C. on the sports field where the trend (hardly a trend,\nmore a fact of life) is continuing as far as Men's Sport is concerned. Unfortunately, the Ladies' Hockey\nTeams were unable to beat U.C., going down 3-2 in a very close match. Considering that U.C. has about five\ntimes as many girls as us, the result should be no\nsurprise but our girls have constantly over the years\nturned out performances far better than can be related\nto the numbers available for selection.\nThe Rugby and Football Clubs have reached the\nsemi-finals and the Hockey Club the final of the U.L. Cup. The Hockey final takes place on Wednesday,\nMarch 8th at Motspur Park against U.C., when support\nwill be welcome.\nFollowing last issue's remarks about mismanagement\nof fixtures, the football semi-final at Q.M. C. against\nGoldsmith's was called off after some peculiar dithering by the opposition.\nIn an internal game of football, feeling ran high when\nGuilds beat R.C.S. in the Tech. Cup and so retained\nthe trophy. The score was 1-0 and one outstanding\nblack eye!\nscored twice to draw level.\nIn the final few minutes\nI.C. hit back and after a goal mouth scramble were\nawarded to a penalty flick.\nThough the goalkeeper\nsaved Mick Barton's flick\na technical foul resulted in\na goal being awarded from\nwhich Barts never re cov ered.\nTeam:\nBoulton, Tyrrell, Hewan,\nBrowne, Barton, Forbes,\nSchofiedl, Richman, Astley, Tucker, Tatchel.\nRecent Results:\nI.C.9, BAC Weybridge 1.\nI.C.3, Poachers 2.\nI.C.2, GWR 0.\nResults so far: P WDL FAI.

Rifle Club held their individual Club Championship. Mary Mitchell won the N.R.A. Donegal! Medal, tieing with Richard Kenchington at 67 points, but beating him with the better score (all in the Bullseye) at 600\nyards.\nAfter a rather undeserved draw in the quarter\nfinal of the ULU Cup at\nHarlington, I. C.1st XI took\non Thames Polytechnic in\nthe replay away from\nhome. The game marked\na break in tradition, when\nSteve Wells\u2014a ULU player\u2014was included in t the team as a sweeper. This\nwas necessitated by a late\ninjury to one of the team's strikers. The big contrast\nbetween the two teams\nwas the fast direct break\nfrom defence of the I.C. team, as against the pretty\nmidfield approach work of\nThames. As the game\nwore on, I.C. were too frequent off target with their\nshooting. A very good 5-man move ended with\nWillcock shooting just\nover from 20 yards. Intelligent over-lapping by\nWorthington and Maslin\nadded weight to the at-tack, and Kelly, Milne and\nSmith all tested the goalkeeper with long range\nshots, but he seemed in a more confident mood than\nin recent matches and after much frustration the\nteams turned round with\nstill no goals having been\nscored.\nIn the second half the\npattern was much the\nsame and apart from one\nchance falling to the\nThames centre half, Whitham was very rarely called\non to show his work. However he did make a very\ngood diving save from a20 yard shot a few minutes\nfrom the end of the game,\nwhich must not go un mentioned. The stalemate ended\nafter 30 minutes of the\nsecond half, when after\none of Richards many\npiercing raids into the\nopponents' territory, Fryer\npicked up a loose ball inside the box, evaded a tackle and rounded the\ngoalkeeper before slipping\nthe ball home from a narrow angle to score the\ngoal which gave I.C. victory and a place in the\nsemi-final against Goldsmiths.\nThe Hyde Park relay shaping up last Saturday. The\nfield included all nationalities.\n\n"
