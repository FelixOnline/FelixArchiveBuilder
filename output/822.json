    "content": "THE j.... iR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nExams in\njeopardy\nThe Association of University Teachers have voted to boycott University\nexaminations and course work in a move designed to highlight the AUT's claim for higher wages. From January 9, AUT members will refuse to set,\nmark or in vigil ate examinations and will decline to mark course work,\nalthough academics will be free to offer advice on improving items of\ncoursework.\nAccording to the results of a ballot\nreleased on Wednesday, 64% of the\nAUT's members are in favour of the\nmove which has been described as\n'the strongest form of action ever\nconsidered by the association.'\nThe AUT say that they have been\nper suing the pay claim for the past\neleven months and they are\nunhappy that the Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals (CVCP)\nhave refused to discuss the matter.\nThey claim that University teachers\nare underpaid compared to their\ncounterparts in Industry and the\nCivil Service, but the CVCP argue\nthat money for wage rises is not\navailable.\nAUT General Secretary, Diana\nWarwick commented 'The decline\nin academic pay is critical for\nacademic staff, for universities, and\nfor the nation which needs high\ncalibre graduates. This vote\ndemonstrates that our members are\nprepared to L? ke damaging action\nbecause they have no option'\nThe move has received a mixed\nreaction within Imperial College and\na number of academics are\nreportedly considering resigning\ntheir membership in the AUT in\nprotest to taking action which would\naffect the education of students.\nThe President of Imperial College\nAUT, Sue Parry said that the AUT\nconsidered a number of other forms\nof action including strikes, mass\nresignation and withdrawal from\nGovernment research projects. She\ntold FELIX that the only effective\nform of action was an examination\nboycott and pointed out that this\nwould be less damaging to students\nthan striking or mass resignation.\n'We hope that it will not reach the\nstage where students would have to\nleave College without degrees' she\nsaid.\nFollowing a mandate at the Union\nGeneral meeting on Nov 29,\nImperial College Union President,\nNigel Baker has written to the\nacademics at Imperial highlighting\nthe Union's concern at the AUT\naction. In the letter, due to be\ndelivered today, Mr Baker urges the\nacademics not to follow the AUT\nexamination boycott and points out\nthat the action could result in\nstudents having to leave the\nUniversity without a degree, or if\nexaminations were delayed, with\nlower grades than they deserve. The\nletter also points out that although\n64% of the AUT members who filled\nin a ballot paper voted in favour of\nexamination boycotts, this\nrepresents only 37% of the AUT's membership.\nUnion President Nigel Baker told\nFELIX that he was worried that the\nCVCP would 'call the AUT bluff\nseverly affecting the position of final\nyear students.\nJackson slides\ndeeper\nFollowing the narrowly defeated motion of 'no confidence' brought up\nat the University of London's General Union Council (GUC) on December\n5, Stuart Jackson, President of the University of London Union (ULU) looks\nset to face a second 'no-confidence' motion at the first GUC of next term.\nAt least six major students unions\nwithin the University of London,\nincluding King's College, the\nLondon School of Econcomics\n(LSE), and University College have\npassed 'no-confidence' votes\nagainst Mr Jackson at emergency\nexecutive meetings.\nImperial College is the only large\nunion which has not yet formed a policy on the motion since the last\nGUC, reported in Wednesday's FELIX and ICU President, Nigel\nBaker told FELIX that there are no\nplans to discuss the issue at an ICU\nexecutive meeting.\nThe GUC's no confide nc ing of Mr\nJackson is in part based on his\nfrequent support of the\nGovernments attitude towards the\nNational Union of Students (NUS).\nMr Jackson stressed that in the\npast he had been 'standing out'\nagainst the Government, which he\nclaims wants the power to destroy\nstudent unions.\n'Now I think the Government are\nright; the NUS is a waste of time\nand rate payers money' he said.\nThe ULU executive and leading\nmembers of many student unions\nwithin ULU remain displeased with\nMr Jackson's conduct. His handling\nof the student loans issue, in\nparticular, has angered them.\ncont'd on back page\nISSUE82216 DEC1988 "
