At present\nour main collecting event will be 'Year Rag'.\nThis is a24 hour collection starting on Friday\nmidnight and finishing on Saturday midnight.\nWe hope to organise collections all over\nLondon and especially a 'Bed Race' on the\nSaturday morning (to which other London\ncolleges may also enter).\nOther events during Rag Week will include\nExecutive Torture on Tuesday, a sketch by\nGuilds in the Smoking Concert on Thursday\nand the Bristol 24-hour Pedal Car Race on the\nFriday and following Saturday.\nReturning to next week, we have a fantastic\nValentine's Party being organised by all three\nCCUs on Monday (note that this is on the\nright day\u2014unlike the IC Ents Party). The party\nwill include a Barn Dance, a Hawian Band,\nFood, a Disco, and a Bar. The price is \u00a31.50\nand it will take place in the Union Building from\n7:30pm. On Wednesday we have a trip to the\nScottish Universities' Enginering Field Day (to\nwhich we have been invited). Teams are\nrequired for rugby, football, cross country,\nrunning, squash, table tennis and snooker.\nSee Steve Bishop in the Guilds Office if you\nare interested (note: this is also open to\nengineers from Mines).\nOn Thursday the Civil Engineering Society\nhave their annual dinner at the Forum Hotel\nand the Old Centralians have a function in the\nSCR called 'Life After College' and open to\nsecond year students only (price \u00a32). See your\nsoc rep or come and see us in the Union Office\nif you want further details on any of the above\nevents.\nFinally thanks to all those that came Ten-Pin\nBowling last week, it was a great success and\nwe hope to repeat it at some time. Dinner and\nDance went very well last Friday. Barry Cryer\ngave a highly entertaining speech and the band\n'Jumpin' Jive' gave the occasion just the right\nkind of atmosphere.\nHave an eventful week everybody.\nCheers.\nRolf\nIC Radio\nAn IC Radio programming planning committee\nwarning:\n\"Cutting outside broadcast lines can\nseriously damage your health\" especially\nwhen our technical manager 'White Tears'\nMartin pj act is es d his black belt karate.\nNow a lot of you intelligentsia out there are,\nby now, no doubt asking yourselves (very\nquietly): \"Why bother listening to IC Radio,\nwhen we have so many 'professional' stations\nto listen to?\" (If you haven't asked this\nquestion, turn around and ask the person\nsitting next to you and loose 5 Brownie\nPoints). Apart from the normal IC Radio reply\n\"We're a student radio station, broadcasting\nthings students want to hear\" etc, etc\u2014let's compare IC Radio and Radio One (hereafter\nknown as Rl).\nInstead of putting some husky-voiced female\nDJ 'after dark' on Sunday evenings (in)famous\nfor appearing \"a I' embrace\" with great\nguitarists on their album covers\u2014IC Radio\nPPC (see above) proudly present tonight the\ndulcet tones of Shinee; admittedly she has not\nappeared on any record covers (yet), however\nan impeccable choice of music and 4ft snake\ncalled Basil should make up for that. Later on\nFriday Rl's 'Newsbeat' is outshone by IC\nRadio's 'Viewpoint' with super news-hound\nPete Coleman\u2014what he lacks in a world-wide\nnetwork of reporters, he makes up with\nboundless enthusiasm and curly hair.\nOn Saturday, just to prove Rl is short-staffed, we have different people presenting\nfirstly our Chart Show (we beat them by 24hrs anyway!) and then our heavy metal programme 'Atomic Rock'. So you get Ajay and\nNeil for the price of Tommy Vance (pretty\ncheap\u2014says Cardboard Cut-out).\nAnd on Monday morning, instead of turning\nin with Selina on the BBC, Angela on TV-AM\nor Barbara Cartland on STOIC\u2014tune in on\nyour radio to 'Chunks' Pashley, who will be\nrocking your early morning pineapples with\ngreat vigour.\nThe rest of the weeks programming I shall\nreview next week. (Promises, promises!) But\nanyway, be warned 'the return of the goldfish-hunter' is under production!\nMo says Theisman for President, and I would like to point out, that I did not mention\nthe Station Manager.\nThe Exile\nSTOIC\nHello there, the Butcher of Lyon here with\nmore advice on how to disappear in South\nAmerica for forty years. But first something a little more topical. Next Monday is, of course,\nSt Valentine's day, but don't worry if you've\nforgotten to send your loved one a card,\nSTOIC is offering its very own Valentine\nservice. Just post your message to the College\nTV studio and someone will be eternally\ngrateful to you. We promise to treat all\nmessages with the utmost discretion and will\nonly broadcast those that will not offend\nFELIX readers.\nNext week is especially important for\nSTOIC\u2014it's our thirteenth birthday. Yes,\nSTOIC is going to be a teenager on Thursday\n17 with all the problems that can entail.\nBirthday cards should be addressed to the TV\nStudio. Altogether now:\nHappy birthday to you.\nHappy birthday to you.\nHappy birthday to STOIC.\nHappy birthday to you.\nBefore I go, I'd better tell you not to belive\nanything you read under STOIC's What's On\nentries in FELIX. These have been shown to\nbe a major contribution to Martin Z Cowan's brain haemorrhage.\nThe STOIC toad is called Robert.\nRSM\nWell, hopefully all the fuss over the review has\nsubsided by now and everyone can get on with\nthings as usual. (By the way, I hope you all\nenjoyed it.)\nThe Newcastle Trip is tomorrow, so if\nyou've signed up, meet 8:15am at Victoria\nCoach Station. Remember to bring Unioncards.\nCamborne are coming up on February 19\nand we need all you people to come out and\nsupport the various teams. Three matches will\nbe played at Harlington: hockey, soccer and\nrugby and there will be a dinner in the evening\nwith beer provided.

Hurry up\nand get your name on the list to see us win\nback the bottle.\nOther dates to remember are Dirty Disco,\nFebruary 22 (with or without pickets?) and aUG M on Tuesday, February 15.\nOur cupboard is now completely re-stocked\nwith regalia so if you want something drop into\nthe office.\nAstro Soc\nOn Tuesday February 15, Astrosoc will be\nshowing a film about Mars so come along and\nfind out what Martians really look like. The film\nwill be shown in Physics Lecture Theatre 2,\nLevel 1, at 6:30pm as usual. Events being\nplanned for the future are so exciting that I won't tell you what they are yet, the wait will be\nunbearable for you so just keep an eye on the\nnoticeboards and you'll find out in time.\nRemember to leave yourself free between 6:30\nand 7:30 on Tuesdays or I 'll send a da boys\n'round.\nOp Soc\nThose of you who actually look at the many\nnoticeboards around College may have\nnoticed attractive butterscotch-coloured\n(actually Kestrel Corn coloured) posters that\nhave recently appeared advertising our coming\nproduction. For the benefit of the rest of you (I very much suspect the majority) the show is\nThe Yeoman of the Guard, one of the best\noperas that the dynamic duo of Bill Gilbert and\nArt Sullivan produced.

We put all their titles on show in\nthe window, but they are still for sale.\nRe comments about the use of our window\nby various clubs and societies. When I was\napproached, I agreed on the condition that I would decide when the window could be used,\nthat the Bookshop would not sell any of the\nbooks etc for the society.

    "content": "SUPPLEMENTARY SCRIBBLINGS\nFree prescriptions dental treatment and glasses for students Although students are not\nautomatically eligible for free\nprescriptions, dental treatment\nand glasses, most students can\nget them free on the grounds of\nlow income. In calculating your\nincome for these purposes the\nDHS S takes the total grant\nfigure and divides it by 38 to get\na weekly rate (30 weeks term-time and 8 weeks vacations). For\n1982/3 this works out at \u00a350.00\nper week. If, after deducting the\namount you pay for rent and\nrates, your total weekly income\nis between \u00a319 and \u00a328 and\nproviding you don't have savings\nof over \u00a32,000 you should be\neligible for free treatment. If\nyour income is only slightly\nmore than \u00a328 per week you may\nstill be eligible for treatment at a reduced rate.\nExpectant Mothers\nNursing Mothers\nWomen who have had a baby\nin the last year\nChildren under 5yrs with approved\nnurseries, play groups and child minder s Children under 16yrs Young people under 19yrs and\nin full time education.\nstill\nFREE ENTITLEMENTS\ny dental\ntreatment\nyy glasses milk and\nvitamins\ny Summer Vacation\nThere is no element in the\nstudent grant to cover the\nsummer vacation and consequently if you don't find\nsummer employment you will be\neligible to 'sign on' for Supplementary Benefit. People on\nSupplementary Benefit have\nwhat is known as an 'automatic\nright' to free prescriptions,\ndental treatment and glasses so it\nmay be worth sav in0 any non-urgent treatment until the\nsummer if you do not qualify at\nother times.\nIf you have an 'automatic\nright' simply tell your dentist or\noptician and ask them to arrange\nthe forms for you. For prescription charges, get a receipt when\nthe c.c. unions\n\u2014 present a \u2014\n7\"3u pin\nBARN DANCE \u2022LATE BAR\nDISCO \u2022 H AVI1 AN BAND\ntI Page2J\nyou pay the charge and take it to\nyour local DHSS Office who\nwill give you a refund.\nPrescriptions\nPrescriptions now cost \u00a31.30 per\nitem and another increase is due\nsoon, so it's worth investigating\nyour entitlements. Don't wait\nuntil you need a prescription, get\nform P ll now and apply for an\nexemption certificate. If you are\nsuccessful in getting a prescription exemption certificate on the\ngrounds of low income, this will\ngive you the 'automatic right' to\nfree dental treatment and\nglasses. If your claim is refused\nand you think you may need a large number of items on\nprescription in the next few\nmonths then it may be worth\nconsidering a pre-payment\ncertificate. These cost \u00a37 for 4\nmonths and \u00a320 for a year and\nthey cover the cost of any\nnumber of prescriptions needed\nin that period. To apply get form\nFP95 from your local chemist,\nPost Office or DHSS.\nDHSS Treatment\nDental charges can only be\nclaimed back for treatment\navailable under the National\nHealth Service. No help is\navailable for private treatment.\nThe Student Services Office and\nStudent Health Centre have\nlists of dentists willing to provide\nNHS treatment to students but it\nis always advisable^to check with\nthe dentist that the work he\nintends to do can be covered or\nyou could end up facing a substantial bill.\nSome dentists will arrange the\nreimbursement of costs for you,\nmost will expect you to pay the\ncharge yourself and claim them\nback. Ask the dentist for form\nFID, fill it in and send it to your\nnearest DHSS office who should\nreimburse you if you are eligible.\n\u2022\nFree NHS Glasses\nAs with dental charges free\noptical treatment can only be\nclaimed for work available\nunder the NHS. This includes\nNHS glasses (frames and lenses)\nbut not contact lenses. There are\nsix types of frames available\nunder the NHS, ask your optician to show them to you. Sighttests are free to anyone but you\nmust tell the optician that you\nwant a NHS not a private test.\nAgain check with the optician\nbefore you start that any\nintended work can be covered\nunder the National Health Service. As with dental charges\nyou will have to pay first and\nclaim back later. Ask the\noptician for form Fl, fill it in\nand send it to your local DHSS.\nStudents with Families\nIf you're supporting a family on\na student grant it's essential that\nyou know your free entitlements.\nThe table above may help.\nMore Information?\nLeaflets P ll for prescriptions,\nDll for dental treatment, Gil for glasses, a MV11 for milk and\nvitamins are available from the\nStudent Services Office, Student\nHealth Centre, your local DHSS\nand most central Post Offices.\nThese leaflets explain more fully\nwhat you can claim and in the\ncase of the P ll and MV11 contain necessary forms for you\nto complete and send off.\nRemember it is easier to apply\nfor a prescription exemption\ncertificate now than it is to try\nand claim back prescription\ncharges once you've paid them.\nAlso, as mentioned above,\nholding a prescription exemption certificate gives you the\n'automatic right' to free dental\ntreatment and glasses.\nIf you have any queries or\nproblems with your claim, call\ninto the Student Services Office,\n15 Princes Gardens, any weekday between 9:30am and 6:00pm. These benefits are yours by\nright - make sure you claim them.\nKaren Stott\nStudent Services\nI February 11, 19831 I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "PINCCCHIC\nSex, Scandal, Intrigue - The UGM\nHangover\nWhat a to do there has been at Primelia\nCollege this week! After the U GM motion on\nSexually Explicit Thoughts In Union Officer's Minds, there has been a great debate over\nwhether the motion was passed, and what the\nmajority was. Enter the combatants\u2014a spokesperson from Women In Men's Private\nSector, Michael Newperson, Hugh SouthernComfort from Hughs In Science and\nTechnology (HIST\u2014Hugh Is Still Trying) and\nUnion dictator Stephen Goldameir.\nLet me fill you in:\nThe WIMPS spokesperson, since it\nconsiders men and women to be equal, always\nlies to give both sides a fighting chance.\nStephen Goldameir, the original e qui voc at or, perhaps, tells alternately truth then lies,\nbut not necessarily starting with the truth.\nHugh Southern-Comfort, the eternal\noptimist, tells nothing but the strict, rigorous\ntruth.\nAll three phoned Nick Pain, the U GM Chairperson, simultaneously, and left him with\nthese messages;\n\"The next statement is false. The last\nstatement was true. If I am telling a lie, then the\nmotion was defeated. The majority was a clear\nmajority.\"\n\"The motion was passed, and this statement\nis false.\"\n\"The motion was clearly defeated.\"\n. Now, a statement is that which ends with a full stop, so can you tell me who said what\nand what the result of the election was (if the\nmajority is not clear, then it is obvious).\nGood luck everyone! j Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm, \u00a35 from\nMenda-Bike for a randomly selected entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nReturn to Killinbuckton\nNever mind about how many moves the train\ntook, the quick et way to turn the train round is\nshown below. Of the five people to enter, CN Goh, aPG of Elec Eng, was selected as this\nweek's winner, and can collect his \u00a35 cheque\nfrom the FELIX Office after 1:30pm on\nMonday. This solution does assume that while\na coach is stood on the part of the track one\ncoach length long, other coaches can move\npast it.\nThree footnotes this week:\nFirstly, I'm thinking of running a few more\ndifficult, non-prize puzzles, requiring the use of\nhigher mathematics. I already have a few; from\nDr Pretzel I have the problem of trying to\nescape in a rowing boat (already nicknamed\nBeauty and the Beast in the FELIX Office),\nfrom Martin S Taylor the Undergraduate and\nthe Porters problem and the Car Parking\nproblem. I could do with a few more up my\nsleeve before I launch into anything new. Has\nanyone got any favourite problems?\nSecondly, I apologise for this week's puzzle\u2014it started out as a great idea involving\nPIST (People In Science and Technology\u2014\notherwise known as the Royal School of\nMoans), the Royal School of Herpes, some\nFELIX hacks etc, but by the time I'd spent\nthree hours trying to work out logical paths,\nsome of the enthusiasm had gone, and you\nnow hold in your hands the rather feeble dregs\nof that once great puzzle.\nFinally. I 've received several complaints\nabout FELIX Victorious. The first printed\nsolution, several people claim, has no set of\nscores corresponding to it. However, this is in\nfact a very clever solution submitted by Michael\nBegley of Maths 2, who pointed out that I had\nnot actually said that each team had played\neach other once, and that it may in fact be the\ncase that we were half way through a 'home-and-away' competition in which each team\nplayed each other twice. However, there is\nanother one of those tables to which there may\nwell be no solution\u20141 think I was given a solution, but I threw them all away last week.\nSorry, Perola, I can't substantiate my claim\n(and I can't be bothered to!).\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit.

    "content": "Grease in Greece\nSummer Lovers directed by Randal\nKleiser, playing at the Classic, Shaftesbury Avenue and Studio Oxford Street.\nGreek Islands are 'in' for film makers this\nyear. The Tempest, of which more in weeks to\ncome, is set there, and so is this offering from\nthe man who brought you Grease and The\nBlue Lagoon. Crease is the all-time top\ngrossing musical; the reaction to Blue Lagoon\nwas somewhat less rapturous. If, like me, you\nwere privileged to be a regular FELIX reader a couple of years back, then you won't forget\n'Eric' Jarvis's demolition job on that film;\nprobably the best hatchet job I 've ever read.\nSo what dire tion has Mr Kleiser taken with his\nnew film?\nThe plot, such as it is, is somewhat\nimprobable, nay silly. Michael and Cathy are\ntwo rich American kids taking a long summer\nholiday in the Greek island of Santarini before\nreturning home to their daunting world of\nadulthood and responsibility. Apparently\nMichael has inherited his deceased father's business, and Cathy is about to take on the\nmore daunting challenge of Michael.\nTheir relationship is somewhat old hat,\nhaving been 'going together' for five years.\nWhen someone coined the phrase 'five year\nitch', 1 think it was meant to be post-marital.\nHowever, whether it is this, the acres of\nbronzed naked female flesh on the island or\nthe apparent danger of permanent physical\ndamage if Cathy gets any more ideas about\nimaginative foreplay that drives him into the\narms of Lina we shall never know. 'I'm just\nmixed up' our hero explains.\nThe two women in Michael's life are a fascinating contrast. Cathy is a classic bronzed\nhealthy California, hair bleached white in the\nsun. She is somewhat shy and acutely aware of\nher goody-two-shoes image (reminiscent of\nSandy in Grease). She is 'totally devoted to\nyou', possessive to boot, Michael is all she\nwants. Lina is a whole different ball game. I can't easily describe her beauty; it is something\nthat grows on you throughout the film. She\nisn't the Bardot type, but that other sort of\nFrench beauty. Senusous, wide mouth, girlish\nsnub nose and freckles framed with auburn\nhair; she is not as e duct russ but rather her\napparent vulnerability lures you on; totally\ncaptivating. Mysterious and foreign, she is\ncarefree and independent, an archaeologist on\nan island dig by day and part of the island's swinging set.\nThis potentially interesting formula for\nconflict is dodged; after all, we are making a surfin-and-swing in film here and not into\nmaking value judgements about relationships.\nSo instead of having to choose, Michael finds\nhimself the centre of an unlikely menage-a trois as they are swept up by Lina's outrageous\nff ii y mi bmw until 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nfriends. Tiring for the poor chap, but nice work\nif you can get it.\nThe attraction of the Greek islands as a film\nsetting is obvious: they are quite stunning. But\nif you are looking for a place to get away from\nit all, forget it. Some of the beaches are more\ncrowded than Bognar on a Bank Holiday. The\nblack shrouded locals mount a silent vigil as\nferry load after ferry load of backpackers are\ndisgorged onto their island, frantically in\nsearch of the good times their brochure\npromised them. These two lifestyles rub\nshoulders, one tact i turn ly resenting the\nnecessary evil of the other as for five months of\nthe year naked young bodies clutter their\nThe Evil Dead, directed by Samual Rainui\nopens at the Classic and Studio Oxford\nStreet on February 24.\nMy other offering for you this week goes\nfrom the faintly ridiculous to er...well it's definitely not sublime. It bills itself as 'the\nultimate experience in gruelling terror', and\ncertainly pulls no punches in an attempt to\nprove it. It's an out and out horror film which\nmakes Friday the 13th seem as harmless as\nMonsieur Hulot's Holiday. The heroes are five\ncollege kids, just like you or I, who have hired\nthis cabin way up in the hills from someone or\nother at a surprisingly cheap rate. The trail\nleads over a bridge which is in a state of near\ncollapse to a rather dilapidated shack in the\nmiddle of a mist-shrouded forest.\nNo time for plot or character development;\nno time for any real legend to be developed\nabout the resident ghouls and nas ties. The five\nfriends are just settling down to their evening\nmeal when the cellar door decides to throw\nitself open, luring them on. The presence in the\nhouse taunts them and lures them into the\ncellar. It starts off as a game of dare, but not\nfor long.\nNo self-respecting horror film would be\nwithout its cellar, and this one is a beauty. Full\nof dripping shadows and sort of 'things'\neverywhere, but more importantly there is a book bound in human flesh and inked in human\nblood and a tape recorder of observations\nmade by an archaeologist (profession of the\nweek, folks \u2014 next week management\nconsultants?) who was apparently the last\nin cum ban to; this ritzy piece of real estate. The\ntape reveals that the prof had stirred up the\nbeaches and their quiet markets become a clam our of ex huber ant foreign tongues.\nFortunately Michael and Cathy are on a better class of package tour, and we are\nspared sex among the sleeping bags as they\nare whisked off to their cliff top villa.\nThere is a wide variety of chart-topping\nmaterial on the soundtrack, including Depeche\nModes 'I just can't get enough' and Chicago's 'Hard to say I'm sorry'. A classic youth film,\nlight on plot and moral dilemma but a good\nlooking cast and a fabulous sun-drenched\nsetting. An undemanding night out, but it will\ntransport you from drab cold February in\nlondon to carefree days in the sun.\nevil spirits in these parts, and replaying the\ntape once more stirs these spirits who rise up\nand possess them, one by one.\nIt's a real chiller; there's no doubt about\nthat, but at the same time there are moments\nof humour. The humour is visual in nature and\nis almost a game between film-maker and\naudience. Can you really take this seriously?\nAre you meant to? You are ready to scream\nand laugh alternatively at every macabre twist\nand turn.\nIt is difficult to describe the style of the film.\nIt has obviously been made with much verve\nand energy by people with a real love for the\ngenre and a rather macabre sense of humour.\nThis is the first feature from this young film\nmaking team. What will The Evil Dead 2 have\nin store. Bad taste? Certainly, but still very\nentertaining; blood and guts by the bucketful\nand no let up in the tension for over an hour.\nProbably the poorest piece of the film is the\nintroduction, where the low budget nature of\nthe film shows through with bad synchronisation and exposures changing between shots,\nbut once the air is thick with blood and various\ndeadly instruments, this is no longer noticeable\nand the superlative special effects grab your\nattention. The climactic scene is a real stunner\nas bodies melt and disintegrate before your\neyes and things erupt, Alien like, from the\ncorpses. But if Alien turned your stomach, you\nare clearly not cut out for this sort of fare. The\neffect is amazing, far better than the stop-action melt-downs which used to be all the\nrage; it really suspends disbelief as you cringe\nand squirm in the dark of the cinema.\nThe only member of the cast who remains\nsentient long enough o turn in an acting\nperformance is Bruce Campbell who is\nthoroughly convincing and conveys a feeling of\nhorror and helplessness. Full marks to the rest\nof the cast for keeping straight face fc throughout.\nWell, I hope my dreams tonight will be fairly\npleasant, but I think some pretty ugly sig; ts\nare going to stick in my mind. Combine the no-holds-barred nature of the script with macabre\nvirtuosity from the make-up and special effects\ndepartment and the result is a masterful\nshocker of unrestrained destruction and\nmayhem.\nGhoul meets boy\n\u2022 i February 11, 1 9 8 3 HH H H^M HH HH HB HH BH Hi Pencil "

When the\nnumber of complete boats was\nreduced from six to three racing\nwas abandoned. Superb sailing\nbut very cold!\nThe week before saw contrasting conditions and IC beat\nSussex (away) in two races in\nvery light conditions. It is\npleasurable to note that UL2( which now includes no less than\nfour IC defectors) lost in two\nraces and managed to capsize a boat. If you start getting reports\nabout IC2. You'll know who we\nmean!\nIC team: Graham, Graham,\nJim, Richard, Phil, Dave.\nSpecial note: replies concerning sailing in Holland to G Kennedy BE3 pronto please.\nVolleybal\nDid you know that Quasimodo\nwas originally a detective with\nthe Met, but he was slung out\nbecause he keep saying \"I have a hunch '? Or that the most\npopular flavoured chewing-gum\nin Greenland is anchovy? If you\ndid then you're either demented\nor lying because I just made up\nboth stories, but if you're bigger\nthan me I 'll let it pass.\nMeanwhile, having doled out\nthis week's ration of idiocy, to\nbusiness. ICVBC played South\nBank Poly on Wednesday February 2, losing, as is our wont,\nthe first set but finally overcoming our own crappy playing\nand opposition bolstered by a junior national player to win 9-15, 15-13, 15-2, 15-10. Not one\nof our better moments.\nAlso, last Tuesday the trials\nfor the London University team\nwere held and out of the seven\nbod s who turned up, five were\nfrom I CV BC so unless there is a drastic change in recruitment\npolicy, we should be well\nrepresented for the first time\never, in the British Universities\ntournament to be held in Belfast\nin April.\nTwo little bits to round off,\nboth of which were held over\nfrom last week's gem for lack of\nspace.\nFirstly, the reason for the\nclub meeting in the back of the\nvan was to decide a colour\nscheme for the new club kit \u2014\nmaroon shirts, sky-blue shorts\nand fluorescent green socks\nbeing the majority verdict in vile\ntaste. If that's too much for you,\ntry Eno's Fruit Salt.\nSecondly, if any Polish speaking Motorhead fans could\nkidnap Andy Knapp, Physics 1,\nno questions asked, the fee could\nbe worked out later. (Kidnapp??)\nDon't forget, next Wednesday\n(February 16) we are at home to\nGoldsmiths, see you then.\nfie &\nstol\nThe past week has been full of\ninteresting events for Imperials\ntop sports club. Despite a poor\nattendance at the range on\nWednesday some reasonable\nscores were registered, all of\nwhich escape me at the moment.\nTim Higgs again failed to show\nthe kind of form that he thinks\nhe is capable of, with poor scores\nin both external leagues and in\nthe UL match against Cambridge University on Saturday.\nFive IC students were shooting\nfor UL in this match, together\naccounting for nearly 50% of the\nteam. Despite poor shooting\nfrom Cambridge marksmen on\ntheir home range, we were still\nbeaten by 19 points, our team\nupset by the short details and\nunusual range. Gordon Bowser\nimproved drastically on his\nsecond card with Gary Smith,\nMark Barke and Tim Higgs and\nshooting consistently badly.\nNoel Lindsay shot well and\npulled the UL team from the\njaws of ignominy, probably\nbecause of his alcohol content.\nFor all you fresher s who were\nput off by the large crowds in the\nrange last term, we are looking\nfor new targets, so please show\nyour faces. Anybody who looks\nlike Tim Higgs particularly\nwelcome. Will members please\nsign up for club dinner, Bisley\ntrips, etc, on the notices in the\nrange.\nIC1 vs\nIC2 vs\nIC4 vs\nLon HI 5-0\nNLP1 4-1\nGuys2 4-1\nAll opposition were annihilated\nthis week following last week's disaster. Great! Apologies to\nthirds and fit hs re Mx H2 nds and 3rds late cancellations.\nNext week there are a couple\nof extra fixtures, ie vs ICX, and\nsquash's own 'Bottle Match' vs\nCamborne so 'get ticking' if you\nhaven't already. There is also the\nScottish Universities' Engineering Field Day to which IC could\nsend a two-player team.\nCorrection to last week's FELIX: Greg Pollard!

So until next Friday\nImperial College Boat Club entered their first race of 1983 at\nPeterborough on Saturday, and\nin difficult conditions won six\nevents.\nThe first race was a time trial\nover the short 2500m course and\nwas won by the elite cox ed four\nwith the cox less four coming\nsecond and both crews winning\ntheir respective sections. The\ns eni roB cox ed four, novice\nscull er and ladies scull er also\nwon their sections by convincing\nmargins. The ladies cox ed four\ncame a disappointing 4th in their\ncategory.\nIn the second race, a time trial\nover the longer 5500m course for\neights, the College 1st VIII comprising of the top two fours,\ntriumphed emphatically in winning by over a minute.\nIn this they defeated the best\nof the Cambridge colleges as\nwell as top class club crews.\nThe novice and senior B eight\neach came second in their\nrespective sections which all\nbodes well for the coming regatta season.\noc key Firsts\nIC vs UCH02 In\nMemoriam\nIC\nHockey\nFirst Eleven\nIn the year of our lord\nNineteen hundred and eighty\nThree were tragically defeated\nby University College Hospital.\nBy two goals to nil.

But before that I want to\nmake sure you noticed the\n'thingy' by the heading. However, meanwhile, back at Crystal\nPalace last weekend IC was well\nrepresented in the BUSF to urna ment. This is probably the\nlargest competition of the year,\nwith representatives from many\nun iver ii ties, polytechnics and\ncolleges. On Saturday Terry got\ntwo bronze medals from 'his\ngroup and on Sunday, Anna got\na silver medal for the women's under 56 kilos event. I fought in\nthe womens under 66 kilos and\nalthough I didn't win anything I was pleased to get through to the\nquarter finals.

It is recognised by NUS and\nsupported financially by Oxfam, Christian Aid\nthe EEC, as well as several charitable trusts.\nAPA is 3W l's longest and most successful\ncampaign, and like the other campaigns, it is\ndesigned to highlight the underlying causes of\nworld poverty and to illustrate the economic\nlinks between the industrial countries and the\nThird World.\nAPA is a student based self-tax campaign,\nsupporters of which commit 1% of their grant\nby banker's order. That comes to about 5pa day for every day of the year.\nHalf the money goes as direct aid, and the\nother half is committed to education and\ncampaigning in Britain.\nSupporters can choose one of the five main\nareas for which their money is used as direct\naid:\nA.

My no. 1\ncomfortable shoes have fallen to pieces and\nI 've bust my spectacles! Result = 1 field of view\nthat tends rapidly towards infinite fuzziness.\nSo this week I went by tube\u2014another shock to\nthe system; it's beastly expensive\u2014and\npottered myopic ally southwards from\nPiccadilly Circus.\nThe Design Council\nThe Design Centre in the Haymarket is the\nshop-front for the Design Council, a Government-sponsored body set up to\n''promote by all practicable means the\nimprovement of design in the products of\nBritish industry\". It's activities include a Design\nAdvisory Service which advises industry on\nproduct design and development and on\nIREVIEWSHi\nsources of technical and design expertise, and\na Designer Selection Service which advises on\nthe selection of industrial, graphic and interior\ndesigners.\n~~ THE\nCOUNCIL The Council also publishes books,\ndirectories and two monthly magazines: in\nfact, it was whilst glancing through DESIGN in\nthe Haldane that I came across a glowing\nreport on the small company, based in\nHampstead, that designed spectacle frames!\nDesign Centre Selection\nEvery month the Design Council selects 100 or\nso products for the Design Centre, to illustrate\nparticularly well designed modern British\nproducts. The goods are chosen by independent committees and if judged to be well suited\nto their purpose, well made, easy to use,\nsimple to maintain, good looking and good\nvalue for money, they are awarded the black\nand white Design Centre kite label.\nAs far as the public (that's you and me) is\nconcerned, the reasons for visiting the Design\nCentre are threefold.\nIt provides a continuing but changing\nexhibition of new developments in design: the\ncurrent exhibition is the annual review,\nshowing products of exceptional design\nselected during 1982.\nSecondly, it has a super shop selling,\nneedless to say, products selected for the\nDesign Centre. Par! of the shop is on the\nground floor, visible from the street; the larger\npart, and an excellent arts-and-design-oriented\nbookshop, are upstairs.\nGastronomic Design\nThe third reason for a visit is also on the first\nfloor. This is a small, but high quality, coffee\nshop. It can easily be found, even by those with\nfuzzy eyesight and incipient ly sore feet, by\nfollowing the trail of coffee vapour s and\nheading for the green neon glow, which turns\nout to say \"Coffee Shop\" (!).\nSandwiches are made to order, there's an\narray of delicatessen-style salads and if you\nhave space left on your tray it can be filled with\ngooey cake or a sticky bun. I didn't try the\nwine, but the coffee's not bad and there are\nergonomic ally designed green stools to perch\non.\nDesign Review '83\nThe exhibition area is distinguishable from the\nshop only in that objects for sale can be picked\nup and examined, whereas those on show are\ncarefully arranged, well lit, and mostly behind\nglass. The aesthetic appeal of all products is\nunquestionable beautifully packaged Politi\nTurkist Delight; finely patterned Hornsea\nPottery tableware: stylish sunglasses by Oliver\nGoldsmith, the lense colours toning with the\nframe colours: elegantly simple furniture,\nrather more sophisticated than Habitat basics.\nThe only way to find out whether a 'good\nlooking' product is easy to use' and 'well\nsuited' not only 'to its purpose', but also to\nyours, is to play with it. 1 discovered that the\nRussell-Hobbs micro-chip toaster I'd been\ngiven for Christmas is one of the products\nrecently selected for the Design Centre. I love\nit: it takes doorsteps as well as Melba-toast\nslices; the pop-up mechanism only works (ie\nstays down) when the power is switched on, so\nI don't sit around expecting toast for three\nminutes before realising that I forgot to flick\nthe switch; and when starved toast freaks call,\nit can be used and then immediately restarted\nfor a full toasting cycle at any brown ness setting...my faith in the Design Centre label is\nconfirmed.\nWhere, When, \u00a3?\nThe Design Centre, 28 Haymarket, SW1, is\nopen Mon, Tues, Fri and Sat 9:30-6:00; Wed\nand Thurs 9:30-8:00; Sunday 1:00-6:00.\nAdmission is free; sandwiches start at about\n55p.

Conveniently placed for College opposite\nSouth Kensington tube station, the ambience\nis more expensive than the reasonably priced\nmenu would lead you to expect.\nAlthough the interior is small, tables are well\npositioned so that you are not particularly\naware of other diners and most of the tables\nare laid for two.\nOn to the food. Starters include most of the\nusual options. Whitebait at 95p was much\nbetter value than Minestrone at ;\u00a31.05 which\nsuffered from a lack of parmesan and the fact\nthat you had to pay 30p for bread to go with it.\nMain courses include pasta dishes (\u00a31.651.95), fish dishes (\u00a32.35-3.10) and burgers\n(\u00a31.65-2.95). Meat and chicken dishes cost\nfrom \u00a32.35-3.45 and include quite impressive\nso u ding things like Scallopa di Polio, \u00a32.45\n(chicken with a predominately tomato sauce).\nThe Barbeque Chicken, \u00a32.60, with it's sweet\nmild sauce is worth trying.

    "content": "Flats and rooms in the Head Tenancy Scheme\nHamlet and Cambridge Gardens, Lexham Gardens, Gerrard Mansions\nand Sinclair Gardens are all properties which have been rented by the\nCollege in order to provide an additional supply of guaranteed\naccommodation.\nThey are all places which, without the College's involvement, would\neither not be available as student accommodation or would be let at\nmuch higher rents than those which the College has been able to\nnegotiate. For example, Lexham Gardens would not be let to students\nat all if the College hadn't taken them on and even the most expensive\nflats in Lexham Gardens are around \u00a35 per week per person cheaper\nthan comparable private sector flats in the same area.\nAnother advantage which the Head Tenancy flats have over places in\nthe private sector is that they give you the opportunity to live close to\nother Imperial College students, so you don't have to feel that you are\ngoing home to an alien environment.\nNevertheless, Head Tenancies are essentially private sector\naccommodation which the College has acquired wholesale, and so there\nare things which distinguish them from the College Residences. For\nexample, the College has to pay rent on its head tenancies during the\nshort vacations and this cost has to be passed on to the people living in\nthe accommodation \u2014 although 'home' students who spend the\nvacations living in their accommodation should be able to claim most of\nthe rent back in the form of supplementary benefit. Another point is that\nthe College does not have the same degree of control over furnishings\nand maintenance as it does with its own residences. The role of the\nWarden or Student Manager in the Head Tenancies is very different\nfrom the role of Hall or House Wardens.\nGenerally speaking, however, there is no respect in which the\nCollege's head tenancies are worse than their private sector\ncounterparts, and there are many respects in which they are much\nbetter.\nThe head tenancies provide a wide range of accommodation, from\nsingle flats and beds its to eight-bedded flats. To help you decide which\nwould suit you best, here is a brief resume of the various properties.\nHAMLET & CAMBRIDGE GARDENS\nHamlet Gardens is situated in Hammersmith, a few minutes walk from\nRavenscourt Park underground station. All the accommodation there is\nin the form of flats which range in size from three to eight-bedded units.\nThere are flats in Hamlet Gardens for groups of three, four, six or seven\nand eight totalling over 210 beds in all. The flats vary in their levels of\ndecoration and furnishings but even if you end up in one of the less well\nequipped ones there is plenty of scope for re arranging things so that\nyou end up with a pleasant place to live.\nOne big advantage of living in Hamlet Gardens is that the rents tend to\nbe lower than in the head tenancies closer to College.\nAll the flats have their own lounge, bathroom and kitchen, and\nalthough most of them only have shared bedrooms, several have single\nbedrooms as well. Recently, a number of high quality, centrally heated\nflats have been acquired in Hamlet Gardens. Additionally, central\nheating is being installed in all the flats over a three year period.\ngroup of four and one for six.

    "content": "Tower of\nStrength\nThe Yeomen of the Guard by Gilbert and\nSullivan, performed by Imperial College\nOperatic Society in the Union Concert\nHall, Tuesday February 15 to Saturday\nFebruary 19.\n* Yes, we've managed it! As a result of\nextensive cooperation between Opsoc and\nFELIX we arranged for a critic to attend the first\nfull run-through of a show, and so you are\nactually able to read a review of an IC\nproduction before the opening night. However\nthis does mean that at the time of writing I have neither seen the performers in costume,\nnor heard the orchestra, nor seen the chorus\ntaking the run-through particularly seriously;\nnevertheless, I hope I have gained a good\nenough impression to say whether the\nproduction is worth seeing or not\u2014and it\ndefinitely is.\nBefore I discuss the production, though, a word or two about the opera itself is called for,\nsince Yeomen is very different from the other\nSavoy operettas; indeed it alone merits the title\n'opera' rather than 'operetta'.\nBoth Gilbert and Sullivan considered it their\nfinest work. Gilbert takes great care both in\nthe character is ation and to some extent in the\nplot (it doesn't end with the usual contrived\nand nonsensical happy ending) and Sullivan's music is, as always, perfectly complementary.\nThe opera doesn't miss the opportunity for\nsparkling Gilbertian dialogue, of course, and\nSullivan's genius for melody is as evident as in\nany of his works. But in Yeomen the people\nhave a depth of character which is never\nachieved in the other operas; the story matters\nand one never gets the feeling that the whole\nthing is just an excuse for clever lyrics set to\npretty tunes.\nThe most profound character, and probably\nthe hardest to play well, is Jack Point, the\nmelancholy jester. Starting out in the\nIREVIEWSI\nridiculous position of 'a salaried wit who must\nsparkle with good humour twenty-four hours a day\u2014else he be whipped for it', he watches his\nlife gradually crumble about him. Despite\ndesperate attempts to use his talents to save\nhimself he finally abandons all his pretence\nand collapses to the floor in tears. Not an easy\nrole, yet Roger Middlebrook excels in\nconveying Point's mounting bewilderment,\nfrom the finale of act one where he realises\nthat his plans have gone horribly wrong,\nthrough the superb buffoonery of his\ncollaboration with the jailer Wilfred Shadbolt.\nthe gradual realisation that he has been\ndouble-crossed by Colonel Fairfax, and the\nfinal show-down where he is left completely\nt friendless.\nMr Middlebrook is a large man; too large,\none might suppose, to play a sprightly clown.\nYet he is sufficiently quick-moving to make\nPoint's 'jester' scenes work well, and his size is\nvery much in his favour in making him appear\nawkward and ill at ease in the role of a romantic suitor when compared with the slim-line Nick Keay as Fairfax.\nUnfortunately Mr Keay doesn't come over\ntoo well as the practised woman is er. He speaks\ntoo quickly, behaves too unnaturally, and it is\naltogether unbelievable that he could persuade\na girl to marry him in under ten minutes. But\nhis powerful tenor singing voice makes up for a lot.\nEllis Pike as Wilfred Shadbolt is quite\nsplendid; after so many straight roles, it's good\nto see that his sense of timing is keen enough\nfor the broad comedy of the seduction scene\nwith Phoebe and for his plotting with Point.\nMark Waters is equally convincing as Sergeant\nMerryl, another very difficult part to play well\nAnd Anthony Pearce, who in previous\nproductions has been rather stiff and\nunemotional, is well cast as the stiff and\nunemotional Lieutenant.\nOn the female side, the part of Elsie\nMaynard more than anything needs a very\nAlarum in the chorus over the discharge of an arquebus.\nPages-*! IFebruary 11, 19831\nThe last of the red-hot lovers: Wilfred\nShadbolt (Ellis Pike) being willingly seduced by\nPhoebe Merryl (Sally Donegani).\nconfident and powerful soprano. Liz Bundy's voice fits the part perfectly, and she is clearly\nenjoying every note of the most dramatic\nmusic Sullivan gave to a leading lady. Watch\n' out particularly for the big aria 'Tis done, I am\na bride'. She acts well, too, in the few places\nwhere good acting is necessary.\nSally Donegani as Phoebe is faced with a role where fine acting is essential all the while\nshe is on stage. She manages well, producing\nthe right amount of sexiness (for Phoebe does\nlittle to hide her sexuality) and distinguishing\nher genuine, if immature, infatuation for\nFairfax from her feigned flirting with Wilfred.\nUnfortunately she is equalled in this respect by\nCecilia Nevill, who is badly miscast as Dame\nCarruthers, for she '\":nds it impossible to stifle\nher natural mischievous twinkle and lithe\nmovements\u2014quite incompatible with the dour\nold hag she is playing. Her voice is wrong, too,\nlacking the powerful plum my alto which the\nmusic demands.\nThe set deserves a mention, since the stage\ncrew are deservedly proud of the way they\nhave incorporated the trap-door to provide a realistic entrance to Wilfred's dungeon. It's a magnificent representation of the Tower of\nLondon, and my only criticism is the usual one\nthat it's simply too big. and on a stage as small\nas that in the IC Concert Hall it is very important\nto allow a large chorus as much room to\nmanoeuvre as possible.\nFor this reason the set must take its share of\nthe blame for the way the chorus of villagers\noften march straight on stage, each to a preordained place squeezed tight against the\nset, watching the empty space centre stage\nand waiting for the action to begin. Their\nsinging was accurate and strong throughout\nthough, unlike the chorus of yeomen who\nstrayed horribly out of tune more than once.\nBut the faults are all trifling compared with\nthe strong points of the show, Yeomen is one of\nthe best English light operas, and it's a shame\npeople deride it because it was written by\nGilbert and Sullivan. Opsoc's production\nbrings out all the laughter, the magic, the\nphilosophy and the tragedy 'one by one and all\nat once'. Oh yes, and I cried at the end, like I always do.\nSee it.\nMartin S Taylor\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 FELIX\n\n"

As you might easily\nguess, I am referring to IC Ents.\nI was so ever so pleased noticing\nthat this year Ents have definitely headed in the right directions towards providing an\nintelligent alternative to normal\ncinema.\nMy hopes began to grow when\nthey presented their alternative\nversion of 'Psycho', in which\nthey added incredibly to the\nsuspense by making the audience\nguess what was happening through half of the first reel,\nwhile the screen became filled\nwith psychedelic flickers of light\nand the soundtrack went three\noctaves lower. Such hopes were\ndefinitely confirmed last Thursday night, when mystery and\nphilosophy were enhanced as\nnever before by showing the\nsecond and third reel of The Tin\ndrum in inverse order. I was I simply delighted.\nI hope there is room for '\nPage 41\nfurther development along the\nnew path taken by Ents. A few\nsuggestions could be: a session\non Eisenstein's films shown\nbackwards, a 'mix up' consisting\nof images of Fellini's Casanova\nwith the soundtrack of Hair and,\nfor the real connoisseurs, Apocalypse Now shown with the\nprojector's light switched off.\nYours hopefully\nOlivo Miotto\nPhysics 2\nSensationalist STOIC\nDear Martin\nAfter reading the letters in this\nweek's FELIX concerning the\nabortive rent strike at Bernard\nSunley House I feel that as a resident I must redress the\nbalance by defending Paul Simion from certain STOIC hacks who appear to be resorting to rather belated sensationalism in scraping up a news story.\nBernard Sunley House is\nrelatively poorly equipped in\nterms of social facilities as well\nas being in a less than perfect\nstate of general repair (eg\ncookers with no control knobs\nand lavatory doors which won't shut). As a result it is fair to say\nthat most of the residents believe\nthere is a lot of room for\nimprovement. Consequently a group of residents left Mr Simion to investigate whether a rent strike was practical and\nlikely to do any good. The\nensuing events were as accurately reported in the January 28th FELIX. It was felt unnecessary\nand compromising to involve the\nwarden before any possible\nstrike. Unfortunately the whole\naffair has been blow out of\nproportion.\nThe state of the house is in no\nway Nick Campbell's fault and\nhe is a popular warden. I must\nalso point out that Mr Simion is\nnot the only person in this case\nwith other interests. I hope all\nthe bitching (oops sexist!) will\nnow cease and house committees\ncan do something more positive\nthan write grovelling letters, to\nwhich incidentally not all interested persons were party.\nYours\nMark Cottle\nResident of Bernard Sunley\nPS: If anyone makes insinuations about this letter, I will\nstand against Paul Simion for\nICU President.\nKevan Reeve\nDear Mr Taylor\nI thought I should write\nbecause an accident was reported in the last copy of FELIX in which the information was\nsomewhat exaggerated. I have\nnot had a chance to investigate\n\u2022imam Km aM mU MiM Februa\nthe matter fully but I understand\nfrom the Chemistry department\nthat Kevan Reeve will not lose\nthe sight of one eye, and this was\nknown by Wednesday.\nMy main concern, as Safety\nDirector, is that certain a cci dents, of which the loss of one\neye is included, are not if i able to\nthe Health and Safety Executive.\nFailure to do so could lead to\na serious situation. I would ask\nyou, therefore (as you did over\nthe asbestos problem) to contact\nme, or the department con-cern ed, to check on some of the\nfacts since they tend to be\nexaggerated by word of mouth.\nIt is a report of this nature which\nled me to investigate the accident\nonly to find that it was rather\nexaggerated.\nYours sincerely\nDr G Hargreaves\nSafety Director\nInconsistent Hack\nDear Sir\nI am writing to complain\nabout the inconsistent behaviour\nof certain ICU Hacks, most\nnotably our glorious president.\nRecently, posters for the\nnotorious Mines Review were\nbanned. About two months ago,\ncertain (totally different) posters\nput up by the Islamic Society\nwere removed.\nThe former banning took\nplace only after several days of\nvociferous protest by a large\nbody of opinion.\nAs. for the latter: the posters\nwere put up as part of the\nHuman Rights Fair. They were\npart of a poster display in\nconjunction with a books tall. No\none complained to the Islamic\nSociety about the posters, or\nindeed even mentioned them, yet\nan hour after they were put up\nMr Gould er appeared and\nwithout a word of explanation,\ncalmly removed the posters and\nwalked off again.\nI believe this shows he is guilty\nat best of bias, and at worst of\nthe deliberate suppression of a viewpoint.\nI put it to you that if someone\nin the position of Union President is incapable of acting\nresponsibly he can be replaced.\nYours faithfully\nMujtaba Ghouse\nPhysics 1\nAnd Finally\nDear Martin\nI would like to say a few more\nthings about pornography in\ngeneral, and the Mines Review in\nparticular.\nGeena McKay, in her letter to\nFELIX last week, said she found\nthe Review neither offensive,\ndisgusting, degrading or porno-ry 11,19831\ngraphic, nor did any of the other\ngirls she spoke to. This is hardly\nsurprising, since most of the\nwomen at the Mines Review\nwould be expected to have the\nsame opinion, otherwise they\nwouldn't have gone. It has been\nsaid that the proportion of\nwomen present roughly equalled\nthe proportion of women at\nImperial College, but to me it\nwas fairly obvious at the U GM that few women voted against\nthe motion (banning pornographic events on Union pre-mises) whereas many women\nvoted for it. Geena could not see\nhow I could possibly categorically state what is offensive to\nwomen. Quite simply, I can do\nso because many women have\ntold me that pornography offends them.\nNow about this liberty a rgu ment. Even in liberal Western\nsociety our freedoms are limited:\ngenerally we are free to do what\nwe like, but not to the extent of\n\u2022 encroaching on other people's freedoms. The test of a representative system concerns the\nextent to which it affords\nprotection to its weaker parts\nagainst its stronger or more\nirresponsible parts. For example,\nwe are not free to carry hand-guns, to drive under the influence of alcohol, or to abstain\nfrom paying taxes. Against the\nfreedom of the Royal School of\nMines to sponsor pornographic\nevents, and exploit women's bodies for publicity purposes,\nshould be set the freedom of\nwomen in London (and else-where) to walk alone at night\nwithout fear of being raped.\nThe link between pornography and rape may be tenuous,\nbut I believe that the domination\n(whether explicitly violent or\nimplicit) and humiliation of\nwomen by men, which is what\nmost pornography represents,\nconditions the attitudes of men\ntowards women. Pornography, I believe, is both a symptom and\ncause of sexist attitudes, of\nwhich the ultimate manifestation\nis rape.\nFinally, suppose the Mines\nReview was racist, depicting and\nexploiting (in however subtle a fashion) the domination of black\npeople by whites. In a multi-racial society it would be\ndisallowed immediately, but\nbecause the Mines Review\nfeatures women, and exploits the\ndomination of women, it's supposed to be okay. Our society has got a long way to go\ntowards sexual equality.\nYours faithfully\nRobert Kelsey\nI FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union FIVE GO MAD IN\nFREMANTLE\nFive prominent members and ex-members of ICU are accused of\ncausing \u00a3350 of damage during the Fremantle Hotel party on Saturday.\nPat Leggett, Laurie Tomlinson, Gary Pike, Jon Symes, and Dave\nDunstan will face disciplinary hearings in the next four weeks.\nTrouble started as the band\nHorizon, were finishing their\ngig. A group of non-residents\ntried to push residents away\nfrom the bar. As the trouble\nescalated, Gary Turner, the\nFremantle sub-warden, closed \u2022\nthe bar. This only resulted in\nbeer glasses being thrown about.\nIn addition several promotional\nitems lying on the bar were\nsmashed.\nHowever, most of the damage\nwas done when the vandals\nturned their attention to the\npinball machine. Several people\nstarted butting parts of the\nmachine with their heads, and\nthe back glass was smashed. Mr Turner later commented that 'It\nwas a bad end to a good night,\nthey even had the bloody gall to\ndo it front of me.'\nThe normal procedure in this\nsort of case is that the hall\ncommittee sends the people to a disciplinary sub-committee\nconsisting of Stephen Goulder\nthe Union President, and Dr\nRobin Smith, the College Tutor.\nThese two may then impose a fine of up to \u00a350. If they feel this\npunishment is insufficient, they\nmay then call a meeting of the\nmain disciplinary committee,\nalthough this is rare.\nAlthough the hall committee\nwill not meet until Monday,\nreports of what took place have\nalready been sent to the departmental tutors and the College\ntutor. Dr Smith was unavailable\nfor comment but Student Services Officer Michael Arthur\nsaid that no firm decision had\nbeen taken. However, he said\nthat it was important that the\nculprits should be made to pay\nfor the damage.\nThe pinball machine which was vandalised at the Fremantle party last\nSaturday night.\nJ 'Accuse!\nOne of the most dramatic accusations ever directed against\na British Prime Minister was\nmade by Tarn Dalyell (Labour\nMP for West Lothian) speaking\nto a crowded meeting of Imperial\nCollege Labour Club yesterday.\nHe charged Margaret Thatcher\nwith deliberately and cold-blooded ly provoking an unnecessary war with Argentina,\nwhich led to the death of over\n200 British soldiers, in order to\nbolster her own personal position\nwith a successful foreign ad ven ture.\nThe Prime Minister, he said,\nordered the sinking of the ageing\nArgentine cruiser, the General\nBelgrano, in order to sabotage\nthe peace plans which were then\non the point of success.\nShe did this in the full knowledge that the Argentine\nfleet was returning to port prior\nto a general withdrawal of\ntroops from the Falklands. This\ninformation had been passed to\nher by American intelligence,\nwho had penetrated the Argentine High Command.\nFurthermore, he alleged that\nshe took the decision to provoke\nthe war without consulting the\nForeign Secretary Francis Pym,\nwho was conducting peace\nnegotiations. At the time there\nwas no threat to British forces.\nTarn Dalyell also revealed that\nsome days before the sinking he\nhad privately warned the Prime\nMinister of the horrific consequences of war with Argentina.\n\"I left the meeting chilled,\" he\nsaid, \"she wanted to fight.\" But,\nit wasn't Mrs Thatcher that\nsuffered in the conf ict that\nfollowed: \" No bombs fell on\nGrantham,\" he pointed out,\n\"it's easy to be brave with other\npeople's lives.\" He also claimed\nthat purely political reasons\nwere behind Thatcher's orders to\ninvade South Georgia in appalling weather conditions and\nagainst naval advice.\nThe Prime Minister and her\nCabinet deliberately misled the\nHouse of Commons, he said, by\nlying about the details of the\nattack on the Belgrano. The little\nlies hid the biggest lie of all; that\nthe war was necessary at all. .\nDa lyell has painstakingly\nestablished, through over 300\nParliamentary questions, that\nthe Government has gone to\nextraordinary lengths to obscure\nthe truth.\nHe went on to say that the\ncomputer on HMS Sheffield was\nprogrammed to ignore tae\nWestern made Exocet missiles\nwhich were assumed to be\n'friendly weapons' because the\nRussians do not have them. The\nSheffield was destroyed by an\nExocet in retaliation for the\nsinking of the Belgrano. He also\nsuggested that the merchant\nship, the Atlantic Conveyor may\nhave been deliberately used as a decoy for Exocets, in order to\nprotect warships. Merchant\nseamen were treated shabbily\ntoo: Chinese gallery staff were\ntaken to the Falklands a gair is t their will.\nDalyell, who for speaking out\nagainst the war on April 3 1982\nwas sacked by Michael Fdot\nfrom Labour's Front Bench,\nsaid that most Labour MPs didn't understand the nature of\nthe conflict: 'Galtieri wasn't Benito Mussolini,' he said, 'but\nhe was very nearly Margaret\nThatcher.'\nBoth, like Bonaparte, needed\nforeign wars to stifle crici tis m at\nhome.\nThese startling allegations\nhave so far gone largely un-reported in the British press.'but\nTarn Dalyell anticipates that\nwith the publication of Alexa nder Haig' s forthcoming memoirs, the full truth of Mrs\nThatcher's personal responsibility for the Falklands War will\nbe revealed.\nNo.6361( February 11.19831 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "Theatre\nOther Places; three new plays by Harold\nPinter, directed by Sir Peter Hall, the\nCottesloe, National Theatre.\nPinter's three short plays currently being\nstaged by the National Theatre are strange\nlittle things. The first Family Voices, is about\nthe correspondence between a mother and\nher son. Anna Massey plays a rather saddened\nand frustrated mother and Nigel Havers her\nson, a citv worker who loves his solitary walks\nabout the capital. The correspondence\ntouches upon family matters but the play\nillustrates in a poignant and effective way the\neffects of separation and the inadequacy of\nnon-verbal communication.\nVictoria Station is an amusing little tale\nabout a taxi driver. Martin Jarvis plays the taxi\ndriver (in a real car) and Paul Rogers his\ncontroller. The latter is perched in his box,\nradio telephone in hand, and becomes\nincreasingly irate at the un receptiveness of the\ndriver when directed to go to Victoria Station,\nbut the reason is finally revealed after much\nclever suspense.\nThe third play, A Kind of Alaska, is a rather\nterrifying idea of what someone would say\nafter waking up after a29 year affliction of\nsleeping sickness. The play is based on the\nreal-life epidemic which spread over Europe in\nthe winter of 1916-17, claiming five million\nvictims and confining most of them to asylums.\nThe excellent Judi Dench plays the awakening\npatient and Anna Massey and Paul Rogers her\nsister and doctor respectively. The work is\nquite imaginative and riveting but unless one\nhas directly witnessed such a situation one\nIREVIEWSH\nfinds oneself questioning its realism.\nAll three plays have in common the isolation\nof the individual. The three major characters\nare stranded in 'other places' and Pinter\nexplores their predicaments in his own unique\nway. The dialogue Pinter uses is eloquent but\nstrange. It is not totally realistic but is the sort\nof wording people would mouth if they inserted\na few seconds 'thinking gap' before replying. It\nis concise and contemplative.\nThe plays are also totally bereft of any socalled 'action'. They are rather like still-lifes\nand in this respect could be conveyed nearly\nequally well by television or even radio.\nNevertheless one has the chance of seeing top\nactors and actresses in the flesh. A good\ntrilogy and quite a good evening.\nNick Bedding\n'Family Voices' at the Cottesloe.\nlooked good as did the steaks, \u00a33.15-3.45.\nOf the puddings, orange slices in li quer sauce was delicious but the Rum Baba was\nrevolting\u2014an overwhelming sensation of\nHurnbioi and cheese mould. Prices vary from\n75-95p. Although the kitchens were slow to produce\nfood, service was attentive and very attractive\nin the form of a beautifully dressed Grecian\nwaitress. Little touches like having wine\n(House \u00a33.45) poured and the existence of a sweet trolley helped to make the place feel\nmore expensive than it is.\nThe food is adequate rather than amazing\nbut as an affordable smart restaurant it is well\nworth a try.\nCordon\nBleugh\nValentine's Day Special\nMonday is Valentine's Day, and if there is one\nthing better than taking your loved one out for\na special meal, it is staying in and cooking it\nyourself. There now follows a menu for an\nauthentic five-course Cordon Bleugh repast.\nHors D 'Oeuvres Prawn Sundae\nFry prawns gently in a little butter and leave to\ncool. Make a sauce with the juice and zest of\ntwo oranges and a little arrowroot to thicken.\nPut a prawn in each of two sundae glasses.\nAdd sauce, vanilla ice cream and more prawns\nalternately.

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\nACCOMMODATION\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended to give you an idea of what the College has to offer\nin the way of accommodation and of the regulations which control the\nway in which the accommodation is allocated. Hopefully, this will help\nyou to choose the type of accommodation which best suits your\nparticular requirements and will save you from the effort of making\napplications which are unlikely to be successful.\nThe guide gives information about the three basic types of College\naccommodation. Purpose built Halls of Residence which are all on\ncampus; Student Houses which are large Victorian houses converted\ninto student accommodation, most of which are concentrated in Evelyn\nGardens, about fifteen minutes walk from the College; and, Head\nTenancies, which are not owned by the College, but are leased from\nlandlords and sub-let to students. These are situated in Kensington,\nEarls Court and Hammersmith.\nSince there is not all that much difference between individual Halls\nand between individual Houses, the guide gives emphasis to the Head\nTenancies, which tend to be much more varied.\nApplication forms for students already at the College will be available\nfrom the Student Services Office, 15 Princes Gardens and should be\ncompleted and returned by Friday, March 11.\nHow College Accommodation is Allotted\nA. Residences\nHalls, Houses\nThe following extract from the 'Imperial College Student Residence\nHalls and Houses Regulations and Information' makes it crystal clear.\nNote particularly the underlined bits.\n5. The following principles shall be followed in considering applications for\nresidence:\na) The normal period of residence in Hall or House for student\nmembers shall be one year\"\nb) Not more than 10% may be selected for a second year's residence,\nbut no such members may reside tor more than two years in Halls \"or\nHouses except as provided in 5(d) below and Selkirk and Vickers'\nScholarsc) The proportion of postgraduates in any Hall or House shall be about\n15% of the student members; any IC undergraduate becoming a postgraduate will re qualify for entry.\nd) If a student having been resident for two years, is elected an officer\nof the Union, as listed in Regulation 2 above, he shall be permitted to\nreside for a third year, but none other than the President, Deputy\nPresident and the Secretary shall be permitted to reside in Halls or\nHouses for more than three years.\ne) In applying Regulations 5(b) and 5(d) above, students who take up\nresidence during the first half-sessions shall be considered as re-applicants for any further applications. Students taking up residence\nduring the second half-session will be considered as new applicants for\nthe following application.\nApplying as a New Undergraduate Student\nAll new undergraduate students who are unable to live at home are\nguaranteed accommodation in either an Intercollegiate or Imperial\nCollege Residence. It is envisaged that most of those who could live at\nhome but would, nevertheless, prefer to spend their first year in\nResidence will be able to do so.\nA number of new undergraduates will be asked to apply to\nIntercollegiate Halls\" on the understanding that if their application is\nunsuccessful they will be assured of Residence at Imperial College.\nApplying as a New Applicant\nIt is the policy of the Students' Residence Committee to attempt to\nprovide residence places for all third year undergraduates who have not\nlived in Residence before. It is anticipated that this year we will be able to\noffer places to all third year new applicants, and also to a number of\nsecond year new applicants.\nApplying as a Re-applicant\nThe reason for having a re-applicant system is that it is thought that if\nthere are a handful of people in each Hall or Houses who have had the\nexperience of living in residence and have shown that they have a contribution to make to the life of the community, then this will make\nany given Hall or House a happier place to live in.\nAs it says in the regulations, re-applicants are chosen by a 'sub-committee of each Hall and House Committee whose members have not\napplied for a further year in residence.'\nThe significance of these regulations to your personal strategy for\ngetting a place to live for next year lies in the fact that unless the\ncommittee which does the selection knows who you are, your chance of\nsucceeding in getting in as a re-applicant must be non-existant. So, for\nexample, if you are living in a student House this year, it would in most\ncases be a waste of time applying to live next year in Hall.\nSimilarly, anyone who lived in residence in their first year would find it\nvery difficult to get back for their third year if they had lost contact with\nthe people in that particular Hall or House in the intervening year.\nApplying as a Postgraduate\nApplication forms for postgraduate students on course now who have\nnot lived in Hall before as postgraduates must be returned by Friday,\nMarch 11. Application forms from new postgraduates should be\nreturned to Student Services by September 1.\nLinstead Extension\nHead Tenancies\nHead Tenancy applications are not affected by whether you have lived in\nResidence before or by what year you are in. Most of the Head Tenancy\nacc bm mod ation is in the form of flats or double rooms and the main\nrequirement for applying is that you should apply with one or more\nothers and that you will only be considered for accommodation suitable\nfor the size of the group. The most important thing is to concentrate on\ngetting together a group of individuals who will be reliable and who are\nlikely to be able to live together successful y for a whole session.\nThis year, for the first time, we will be operating a system which will\nenable new undergraduate students to live in the Head Tenancies. There\nare no plans at present to enable new postgraduate students to live in\nHead Tenancy flats, mainly because they have a high proportion of\nshared rooms and most postgraduates need single rooms. It is likely,\nhowever, that new postgraduates will be able to take up single rooms in\nthose Head Tenancies which have them, as a result of some students\nwho are offered the rooms in May, subsequently turning them down.\n1\n\n"

    "content": "Small Explosion in Montpelier\nStreet\u2014Not Many Dead\nThere was an explosion at 1:00pm on Tuesday at Montepelier Hall,\nand all power was cut off until\n6:30pm. The cause of the explosion was\nan overloaded transformer,\nlocated under the pavement\noutside the Hall.\nOne of the cleaners, who was\nin the basement at the time, said\nthat the blast sounded like\none of the Hyde Park bombs and\nflames and smoke were seen.\nA fire engine was called to\nbring the conflagration under\ncontrol, and the London Electricity Board had the offending\ntransformer repaired by 6:30pm. Miss Gittins, the housekeeper,\nsaid they were still working on it\non Wednesday.\nDon Monro, the Warden, had\nmuch pleasure in announcing\nthat the brown and grey rats of\nMontpelier Hall were not\naffected by the blast, nor were\nthe students.\nFELIX Editor Martin S Taylor demonstrating his skill at deception as\nthe three Union sabbaticals play the Jewish Society at Call My Bluff.\nThe full game will be shown on STOIC next Tuesday.\nEmbassy\nProtest\nA force of fifty policemen turned\nup at a protest outside the Iraqi\nEmbassy in Queensgate on\nWednesday \u2014 not to control\nprotesters, but to protect them.\nSome thirty Iraqi students,\nmostly from Imperial, held a silent demonstration to mark the\nanniversary of the coup which\nestablished the present totalitarian regime in their homeland.\nMany wore scarves over their\nfaces to avoid recognition\u2014\nopposition to the State, they told\nFELIX, is a capital offence in\nIraq\u2014and in fact two photographers from the Embassy were\nseen taking photographs of the\ndissidents.\nRepresentatives from the\nNational Union of Students also\narrived and attempted to deliver\nFELIX HH HMMM S aMma petition with over a thousand\nsignatures from representatives\nof almost every student union in\nBritain. They were refused\naccess to the embassy, where\nstaff would not accept the\npetition. An NUS spokesman\nsaid that this was the only\nembassy in London where a petition would not even be\naccepted. As an example of what\nthe petition was about, he said\nthat a student who changed his\ncourse at university abroad\nwithout permission from the\nEmbassy would be liable to a five-year term in prison on\nreturning to Iraq.\nThe police officer in charge of\nthe operation seemed surprised\nwhen asked whether the police\npresence was to keep the protesters calm. He explained that\non previous occasions, demonstrators had been attacked from\ninside the embassy and there was\na possibility of similar trouble\non this occasion. The protest\nended peacefully 2:00pm. Aid for Overseas Students\nForty-six million pounds will be\nput aside by the Government to\nprovide scholarships and awards\nfor overseas students, it was\nannounced on Tuesday. Steps are\nalso being taken that may result\nin students from British depend an cie s such as Hong Kong being\ngiven home student status.\nOn Tuesday, the Foreign\nSecretary Mr Francis Py m informed the House of Commons\nthat some five thousand new\nawards would be made each year\nto foreign students whose British\neducation would be 'an advantage to this country'. (This has\nbeen taken to mean political\nadvantage in foreign relations.)\nThis step is in response to the\nOverseas Students Trust report\npublished last June, which called\nfor a review of government\npolicy, and it was probably\nprepared before the House of\nLords' ruling in December\nwhich made thousands of foreign students eligible for Local\nAuthority awards. The report\nalso called for a scheme allowing\nstudents from British depend an cie s to pay home student\nfees, thereby cutting their high\nrates by up to eight percent. The\nreport considered it ridiculous\nthat the students could be paying\nup to three times as much as\nstudents from Europe. Depending on the outcome of the\nimpending talks with the Hong\nKong government, students\nfrom Bermuda, the Falklands\nand several other territories\ncould be affected.\nMink Stole \u00a310,000 worth of mink pelts were\nstolen from outside the Exhibition Road gates on Friday at\nabout 1:10pm. The van, which contained\nseveral cartons for delivery at a number of destinations, was\nparked on Exhibition Road pointing towards South Kensington Station, while the driver\nwent into the College to find out\nwhere to make his delivery.\nDuring the ten minutes he was\naway from his van two men, who\nPolice believe had been following in a beige Cortina or Granada\nestate, removed the minks. The\npadlock on the back of the blue\nLuton van had been opened and\nthen replaced, to conceal the\nbreak-in.\nMr Donaldson, the Security\nOfficer normally at the Gatehouse, had been called away,\nand returned 1:15-1:20 to find\nthe robbery had already oc-cur red. The minks were in a carton\nwrapped in brown hessian, 5' by\n2' and weighting 75 kilos. It had\nOFT 0230 Italy stamped on. The\nvan had the name 'SG Smith' in\na white circle printed on the side.\nIf anyone has any information\nabout these pelts, which belong\nto Overseas Fur Trading, and\nwere due to be made up in Italy,\nthey should contact: Detective\nConstable Gary Mud den of\nGerald Road Police Station.\nPhone 434-6244.\n\u2022 February 11,19831\nSpending\nSurvey\nAverage student spending last\nyear was over two thousand\npounds, according to the recent\nICU Cost of Living survey. This\ncompares with last year's maximum grant of \u00a31,825.\nThe External Affairs Committee sent questionnaires to two\nhundred randomly selected\nstudents, only eighty of whom\nreplied. From this small sample,\nthe average weekly rent was\ncalculated at \u00a322.64, while the\namount spent per week on\nentertainment varies from\nnothing to fifty pounds. Clothes\nand books accounted for a hundred and fifty pounds per\nyear. Total annual expenditure\naveraged \u00a32,071.83.\nThe committee has admitted\nthat these results are of limited\nuse because of the very small\nsample size. Another, more\ndetailed, survey is being planned.\nClash Cgrds\nThe service till in the Sherfield\nBuilding has been the cause of\nseveral complaints since the\nissue of the new car park cards.\nThe magnetic tickets used by\nmotorists to operate the barriers\naffect the strips on the bank's card dispenser cards.\nThe local branch of the\nNatWest bank has issued a notice advising card holders to\nkeep their service cards separately from their car park\nticket.\nI Page3\n\n"

This means that\nif you want to live in a flat or a double room/flat let, you will need to apply\nas a group of two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight. If you apply on\nyour own, you can only be considered for a single room/beds it. If you are also applying to a Hall of Residence or to a Student House,\nyour application to the Hall or House will be withdrawn once you have\nbeen allocated to a place in a Head Tenancy.\nYou can only make one application to Head Tenancies.\nThis means that if, for example, you apply in a group, you cannot also\nmake a separate application on your own, nor can you make an-application with another group.\nThis year a new option is being offered whereby applicants can elect\nto take a51 week tenancy. Rents will be the same as for a39 week\ntenancy but, at the end of the letting period, a rent refund of 8% of the\ntotal rent payable will be available, subject to all bills having been paid\netc.\nThis option applies to Cambridge Gardens, Sinclair Gardens, Gerrard\nMansions, 85 Lexham Gardens and the Penthouse and Mews flats. In\nprocessing applications strong preference will be given to those opting\nfor a51 week tenancy.\nGroup Applications\n1. You will need: one orange form for the whole group and a grey card\nfor each member of the group\u2014so a group for four would need one\norange form and four grey cards.\n2. The person whose name is at the top of the list on the orange form\nwill receive all correspondence relating to the application. Thus the two\nsticky labels should be filled in, one giving that persons departmental\naddress so that we can notify him/her of the outcome of the application\nat the beginning of the summer term. The other label should be\naddressed to his/her expected whereabouts in early September so that\nwe can send any additional information that may be necessary\n3. Look through the table of Head Tenancies and sec which ones\nhave accommodation suitable for a group of your size. If there are more\nthan one, place them in order of preference by writing '1, or 2 etc' in the\nappropriate spaces on the form. If there is only one, put '1' in the\nappropriate space.\nCOLLEGE FLATS\nCollege Flats\nAlthough these are distinct from Head Tenancies, they are let and\nmanaged in the same way as the Head Tenancy flats.\nSouthside, Penthouse Flats\nThese two flats used to be occupied by wardens, and consequently, offer\na very high standard of accommodation. Each flat consists of two single\nbedrooms, one double, sitting room, kitchen and bathroom. The flats\nare suitable for up to four people. The rent is inclusive of heating, lighting\nand panoramic views of London.\n4. Fill in the rest of the orange form.\n5. Each member of the group must then complete a grey card.\n6. Return the orange form together with ALL the grey cards to the\n\"Student Services Office by Friday, March 11, 1983.\nSingle Applications\n1. You will need one orange form, one grey card and two address\nlabels. The labels should be completed as follows: one with your\ndepartmental address, one addressed to your expected whereabouts in.\nearly September so that we can send any additional information that\nmay then be necessary.\n2. Lexham Gardens has accommodation suitable for people\napplying on their own. The chart shows the number of places that it has.\n3. Return the completed form and card to Student Services, 15\nPrinces Gardens, by Friday, March 11, 1983.\nGeneral Points\n1. The way the allocation system works, the chances are that you will\neither get your first choice or nothing.\n2. If you are applying in a group, experience has shown that problems\narise when smokers share with non-smokers. Please give this point\ncareful consideration when choosing your group.\nAil students who accept accommodation in double rooms and flats will\nbe jointly and severally responsible for the whole rent for their\naccommodation.\nHalls and Houses\nYou need to fill in two address labels and the appropriate form and\ncard.\nThere are different forms and cards to fill in depending on whether\nyou are a new applicant or a re-applicant.\nThese are as follows:\nNew applicant undergraduate and postgraduates: green form and\ncard.\nRe-applicant: blue form and card.\nThe address labels need to be completed as follows: one la bal addressed to yourself in your department so that we can tell you, at the\nbeginning of the summer term, whether or not you have got a place.\nOne label addressed to yourself at wherever you will be in early*\nSeptember so that, if your application is successful, we can tell you\nwhich room you will be in.\nNew nost graduate and undergraduate students are sent different1 application forms, and information by the College Registry.\n78 Princes Gate Mews\nBy far the trendiest flat on offer, it consists of two double bedrooms,'\nlounge, kitchen and bathroom. It also contains the most bijou attic.s in q le \u2022\nbedroom that you are ever likely to see. The flat is suitable for four and\ncomes under the supervision of one of the Southside Wardens.\n9 Princes Gardens\nSituated next to Garden Hall, this house contains five flats for four, one,\nfor three and one for five. These flats are not available for letting\nFebruary/March as it is likely that they will be occupied by new\nundergraduate students next session.\nRobert Pryor House, 53 Evelyn Gardens\nThis house, comprising three flats for four, one for five and two for two is,\nbeing reserved for new undergraduate students.\n\n"
