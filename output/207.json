    "content": "10 FELIX Will it all seem worthwhile\n5 YEARS FROM NOW?\nAt Turner 4 Newall we give a considerable\namount of thought to the question of a man's future. And our graduate training scheme is\nplanned to be adaptable to his individual nae ds \u2014 to employ and extend his attainments fully.\nYou May Know Our Name But . . . just to\nremind you - we are not only the dominant\nasbestos group in Britain, we also hav?a I arg\u00bb\nand growing stake in plastics, in in sul j tion, in\nmineral wool, and in glass fibre . . . all adding\nup to a \u00a3100,000,000 business with some\n40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man\nscope. Yet, because each of our nine British\ncompanies largely runs its own affairs, not so\nbig that the essential 'human touch is\nendangered.\nThis balance is reflected in our executive\ndevelopment training which, far from tying a man down to any one fy pe of career \u2014\nproduction, sales, administration - allows him\ntime to discover his true potential.\nThis way, we invariably fin u that the graduate\nassumes managerial responsibility more confidently - and certainly earlier - than is usual\nin a modern industrial complex.\nAsk your Appointments Board for further\ndetails, or write direct to :\nManagement Appointments Adviser, Turner &\nNewall Ltd., 15 Curzon Street, London, W.1. The Turner & Newall Management Appointments Adviser will be visiting Imperial College\non Friday 14th February 1964. If you would\nlike an interview, please contact the secretary\nof the Appointments Board.\nTURNER & NEWALL LIMITED\nTURNERS ASBESTOS CEMENT CO LTD \u2022 TURNER BROTHERS ASBESTOS CO LTD \u2022 FERODO LTD \u2022 THE WASHINGTON\nCHEMICAL CO LTD \u2022 NEWALLS INSULATION CO LTD \u2022 J W ROBERTS LTD \u2022 BRITISH INDUSTRIAL PLASTICS LTD\n6T1L LITE PRODUCTS LTD 1\nTURNERS ASBESTOS FIBRES LTD AND 15 OVERSEAS MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANIES\n7 ^ r HOCKEY\nWith a large influx of Freshers\nthis year, and a hard core of old\nlags, the competition for places\nin all teams will depend as much\nupon reliability and enthusiasm,\nas upon playing ability.\nThe first team's prospect in the\nLondon University competitions\nthis year are brighter than most\nyears. Last year's strong defence\nwhich helped the team to victory\nin the U.L. six-a sides and near\nfirst place in the U.L. league, is\nreinforced by a county school-boy, one of two who are joining\nthe team this season.\nHighlight of the year will be the\nreturn visit of the Groeningen\nUniversity team at Easter. They\nwill be staying with us in London\nfor a few days, prior to joining\nus at the Lowestoft Hockey Festival over the Easter weekend.\nBOAT CLUB\nAt the Freshers' reception the\nBoat Club has recruited a smaller\nnumber of new members than\nusual. However, from first sight\nit would appear that their quality,\nboth in experienced oarsmen and\nnovices, more than makes up for\ntheir reduced numbers.\nMany of the fresher s oarsmen\nare at present rowing in their\nconstituent college Morphy and\nLowry boats. Morphy training\nhas been approached with even\nmore attack than in past years,\nand crews are at present training\nfive days a week for the race.\nGuilds are resplendent with their\nnew blades. The Mines have the\nstrongest crews we have seen from\nthem for a long time while R.C.S. are at present an unknown quantity under the practised eye of Dr.\nCameron.\nOne serious disadvantage the\nclub has at the moment is a shortage of cox es and anyone experienced or novice, provided\nthey weigh less than 10 St., will\nbe welcomed to try their hand.\nAre you small, quick and in-tell i gent, if so you could become a cox in the Boat Club. All training\nis in eights added to which cox es have full use of the boat club\nfacilities including hot showers\nand bar all at reduced subscriptions. If you wish to cox contact\nany member of the boat club, or\npin a note to the notice board.\nCAPTAINS\nplease note that all copy must be\nsubmitted by Wednesday even on\nweek preceding production to\nDave Hunt, Sports Editor, Felix.\n\n"

Admission will be all one price, 2/-.\nJAZZ CLUB NEWS\nFor the last 5 or 6 years I.C. Jazz Club has been basically a club\nfor musicians. The result has been a very high standard of live\nJazz in the Colleges, as anyone who went to the U.L. V. Jazz Competition or the South Side Stomps last year will recall.\nDRAMSOC\nLast year's Big Band have a practice blow.\nThis year, however, the Jazz Club is opening its membership\nto non-musicians\u2014in tact to the majority of people who like jazz\nand want to know more about it. This term record recitals will be\ngiven on specific jazz topics and personalities, and there will be an\nintegrated Jazz and Poetry concert and one or two jazz evenings with\nrecords and live jazz. Next term, of course, we will be holding midweek jazz dances again.\nYou will be able to join the club at any of the meetings, and\nif you like jazz I hope you will find the programme for this year\nboth interesting and informative. Our- aim will be to develop and\nto broaden interest in jazz, and if you have any suggestions or would\nlike any more information come and see us any lunchtime in the\nJazz Room (above the Union Bar).\nAL. HIGSON, OLD BEIT 20.\nA Man\nFor All\nSeasons\nWe made a mistake on Freshers\nNight. We sent a poster to Bedford. It was quite a party.\nThe Christmas Production is to\nbe \" A Man for All Seasons \" by\nRobert Bolt. This is the most ambitious production we have done\nfor many years. It will tax us all,\nin acting, staging and effects.\nBedford Camaraderie\nThere will be a play visit during\nthe next few weeks to one of the\nWest End Theatres (as yet undecided). By booking large numbers\nof tickets we get them cheap.\nThese visits are open to all members of the College. We shall try\nto get Bedford along too.\nI am very keen to form a Revue\nand Cabaret Group in close association with Dramsoc. To this end\nI am forming a library of such\nmaterial as a stimulus for ideas.\nIf anyone is interested please get\nin touch.\nOur most ambitious and exciting plan is to make a film in place\nof our usual Easter Production.\nH.I. FRAZER.\nAN\nOPEN\nINVITATION\nThe idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank\nTHE GO AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

They\nwere initiated in the art of\nappraising the gliders quantitatively as well as qualitatively, the\ndiversity of gliders available ensuring that each member of the\ngroup was able to make assessments against a background of\nexperience rarely obtainable.\nNeedless to say the enjoyment\ndid not end with the excellent\ngliding available, and such items\nas the moonlight barbecue in\nwhich steaks were grilled over the\nburning remains of a glider that\ndid not stay the rig ours of the\ncourse, and the many evenings in\nwhich they were able to chat and\nsing with students from other\nEuropean countries over a jug of\nale and a\" Bockwurst,\" immediately spring to mind. The many\nfriends and contacts made resulted\nin such a number of invitations to\ncome and glide all over Europe\nthat the gliding club could be kept\nbusy with continental tours for\nmany years.\nThe gliding, the superb hospitality shown and the experience\ngained made the expedition truly\nworthwhile.\nKARL DOETSCH\nMembers relax at Brunswick\nPROSPECTS GORDON\nLOWEST HE IDEAL SPORTS SHOP\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL l.C.

The win was\nachieved with only 12 tit men.\nRay Harris and Jenkens both being off the field at some time or\nother.

The season\nbegan with a good draw (2-2) against Borough\nRd. who are always one of our best opponents.\nThe club looks forward to a successful season.\nCROSS-COUNTRY\nThe club got off to a promising start to the\nseason, with almost all runners in the first half of\nthe field in the first U.L. trials.

It is not, how-ever, a newspaper in the true sense of the word for in general it lacks\nnews. Some may say that this is a reflection on myself and the Felix\nStaff. But I don't agree with this view. Almost all the Felix Staff\nthis year are undergraduates and all have important exams during\nthe year, so they haven't unlimited time at their disposal to ferret\nout news from all corners of the College. They do, however, spend\nas much time as possible, some even to the detriment of their\nacademic work.\nFelix over the years has grown from strength to strength, in\ncontent, presentation, sales and advertising.

    "content": "FELIX FOCUS on Wellsoc\nThe first meeting of the session was an outstanding success for\nWellsoc. This bodes well for the society, which is only now entering its\"second year. Attendance at meetings last year was fairly\ngood, and it is to be expected that with such a wide choice of possible\nsubjects the H.G. Wells Society will continue to expand during this\nyear.\nThe key to this expansion is\nthe programme of speakers, and\nin this respect the future of the\nsociety seems assured for this\nterm at least. The programme\ncould hardly be more varied, with\ntalks on subjects ranging from\nForensic Science to venereal dis-eases, from films on the American\nSpace Research Programme to\nProfessor Buchanan talking about\ntraffic. An eminent doctor is to\ndiscuss his attempts to reproduce\nthe conditions prevalent at the\ntime of the birth of life on Earth,\nand Mr. R.M. Ogorkiewicz of\nthe Mech. Eng. Dept. of I.C. is to\nspeak on H.G. Wells and the invention of the tank.\nWhether the society will attract\nthe attendance it deserves is a matter for some speculation. Last\nyear it received a certain amount\nof bad publicity because it appeared to revolve around Tizard\nHall. However it is perfectly possible for anybody to take an active\npart in the running of Wellsoc.\nIn any case in a society of this\nsort it matters very little who is\nactually responsible for the organisation of the meetings. If the\nmembers want a particular\nspeaker or subject for a Wellsoc\nmeeting then it is up to them to\nsay so.\nNo doubt there are still many\npeople in the College who don't attend Wellsoc meetings because\nthey don't really know what the\nsociety is. If you are in doubt,\nit would be worth your while\ngoing to one meeting to find out for yourself.\nM. EDWARDS.\nEvil Eye\nMagic or Science? This question was raised at the first Wells\nSoc. meeting of the year on Monday, 12th October. Dr. F.J. Nahapiet, a consultant hypnotist,\naroused considerable interest in\nhis short talk, during which he\ndescribed the growth of hypnotism as a medical science and\nhow, in past centuries it was considered evil and magic. A great\nnumber of questions from the\nlarge audience were asked, in clu d ing, one about the possibility of\nenhanced learning under hy p no sis! Dr. Nahapiet then demonstrated the basic hypnotic phe no mena, including anaesthesia and\nage regression, with his subject\nwith whom he has appeared on\ntelevision. The talk was followed\nby further discussion over coffee.\nNext Monday the speaker will\nbe. Dr. W.D. Furneaux, Director\nResearch & Statistics Group,\nL.C.C. and will be speaking on\nUniversity Entrance Procedures.\nInvitation to a Hop\u2014or\nWill you Bacchus?\nKING SIZE \u00bbUST TESTING- - me0 A RKE Dear Sir,\nI watched with great dismay the\nattempts of all the societies to\ndestroy the newly decorated interior of the Union on Freshers'\nday. Isn't it about time that the\nUnion publicity officer tried to\nexert a modicum of control over\nthe flood of advertising!\nThere should be regulations enforced preventing long term ad-vert ising, the Art club were the\nworst offenders last year l There\nshould also be an attempt to keep\nthe size of, posters small and stop\nGuilds from plastering every\nhoarding with hideous adverts for\nunion meetings and other beer y activities. Size is not the ultimate\naim of an advertiser, it is to produce an eye catching poster.\nCan't the Union Executive do\nsomething about this?\nYours faithfully,\nD. Jones\nRadios\nDear Sir,\nI would like to bring attention\nthrough your columns to those in\ncharge of the Union that it is time\nthat the radio in the lower Lounge\nwas replaced; its reception is\natrocious, many midget transistors\nare far superior; tuning is an art\nwhich takes months to achieve,\nand if the continuous high pitched\nwhine continues much longer the\nglasses in the bar may well suffer.\nA good radio is essential to\nlisten to any music and very good\nradios do not cost a lot these days.\nYours faithfully,\nANTl T.V. Bar\nDear Sir,\nDissatisfaction has been registered in many quarters concerning the abysmal service that is\ngiven in one of the plusher I.C. bars. It is felt that no longer\nmust it be regarded as a privilege\nto be served here, let alone be\ntreated with some civility. Sufficient people must be interested\nenough to, if not bring about a radical change, make the place a little more amenable.\nYours faithfully,\nNED TEEDHAM\nThose who were wise enough to\njoin the beer and wine making\nsoc. on Freshers Day, and who\nsurvived baptismal half pint will\nhave a busy term ahead of them.\nIf they can bear the thought of\ncommercial stuff after brewing\ntheir own nectar, they will have\nthe chance to join no less than five\nbrewery visits this term alone.\nThey will be held at the rate of\none a week from next week on.\nUnfortunately the tedium of looking at brewing plant must be\nundergone before the 'free handouts begin, but begin they will,\nand on one of them free lunch\nwill be provided.\nBe ready (members that is) to\nput your names on the lists which\nwill appear soon.\nART There is now a college Art\nClub which meets regularly on\nWednesday and Thursday evenings at the Royal College of Art\n(behind the Huxley building),\nEverybody, whether absolute beginner or expert, is encouraged to\nattend and we hope they will have\nan enjoyable and creative evening\nmaking use of the free tuition and\nmodel provided. If you have\nnever had the thrill of squeezing\noil paint out of a tube now is the\ntime to do it, for the very reasonable cost of 2/6d per evening\u2014or\nby yearly subscription.\nWe hope to organize an exhibition of members work towards\nthe end of the term. So please\nwould anybody with potential\nexhibits get in contact with either\nMiss Connie Fenn or myself (M.C. Wooldridge, room 43 Garden)\nas we should like as. many entries\nas possible.\nSMALL ADS.\nThe charge for Small Ads. in\nFelix is 6d. per line. All advertisements to be sent to the Advertising Manager Felix via the\nUnion Rack by the Wednesday\nprior to publication.\nAll I.C. men, and women too,\nare welcomed at an informal debate to be held at Bedford College at 730 on 28th October,\nwhen the motion will be \"This\nhouse believes that the cost of\nbelonging to N.U.S. is justified\nby the benefits derived from\nmembership.\" Come and show\nhow I.C. feels about this; refreshments provided, etc.\n\n"

There is no danger though of stealing the thunder from the main issue, because all reports must of nec ess it jr be brief.

    "content": "FELIX3 FRESHERS'\nHOP\nOne of the Union's least illustrious.. sacred cows is the\nFreshers' Hop. The purpose of\nthis assembly seems to be to convince the Freshers what a wild,\nswinging time they can have in\ntbe great Metropolis. In fact, it\nmust surely drive them back to\nthe realms of Brown Baggerdom.\nThis year's was typical: On\narriving you found hordes of\npeople milling round the entrance,\nlooking for somewhere to go.\nBecause sign-posting was inadequate or non-existent, only pre-knowledge or word-of-mouth\ncould enable you to deposit your\ncoat.\nBEAT v. SWING\nAfter fighting their way upstairs,\npeople were allowed to trickle into\nTHE CATTLE MARKET\nthe Hop. On turning right into\nthe Concert Hall you were confronted by the sight of the Phil\nJennings band, whose members\noutnumbered the audience. No\ndoubt \"Tea for Two\" and \"Small\nHotel \" went down a bomb at the\n1934 Freshers' Hop, but tastes\nchange.\nYou saw some people drifting\nupstairs and aimlessly followed\nthem, to find the real hop in the\nupper refectory. The Saracens\nwere making up any deficiencies\nin quality by sheer volume.\nThe Upper Refectory was jammed with seemingly hundreds of\npeople. The thought of the great\nopen spaces in the Concert Hall\nmade you wonder why the organisers knew no better.\nHow reading The Observer\ncan help the man who's undecided about his career\nEvery Sunday, The Observer is fill of the best kind of\nvocational guidance. Politics. Art Industry. Finance.\nScience. The Observer looks at them ill without bias.\nWhatare the growth industries in \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nhe north-east ? What\ndoes the average advertising executive earn at thirty?\nHow many management trainees be\"ome managers?\nReading The Observer will give you answers to this sort\nof question. If your present Sunday newspaper seems to\nconfine its realism to the appointments page, try The\nObserver, with its new colour magazine, this Sunday.\nReading it could not only make you more aware. It could\nalso help shape your future.\nDISMAL FAIEURES\nAs expected, the boys outnumbered the girls, but happily the\nBrown Baggers were out in force\n\u2014.supervising but not deigning to\ntake part in the dancing. So there\nwere a few girls in circulation.\nUnfortunately, most looked as if\nthey had been brought by a relay\nof horse-boxes from Bedford College.\nThe Saracens were belting out\nRolling Stones numbers\u2014some\nwere quite well done, but the\nbutchery they made of \" King\nBee\" had to be heard to be\ncredited. Significantly, Beatle\nnumbers\u2014all last year's rage\u2014\nwere now unheard.\nIf you wanted a drink upstairs,\nyou were disappointed\u2014there was\nno bar in the upper refectory.\nYou had to fight your way out\nand downstairs to the bar in the\nCrush Hall. This was in such demand that the beer ran out early.\nSO THIS IS LONDON !\nThe only way to get a break\nfrom the overpowering heat and\ncrouching in the Upper Refectory\nwas to go to the Concert Hall,\nwhere a very few people were\nwaltzing to the strains of Phil\nJennings. You felt sorry for this\nband, but \" gig \" musicians must\nbe pretty insensitive.\nAll in all, the Hop cannot be\nrecorded as a great success and\nonly give Freshers a false view of\nCollege life and London life gen-e rally. What went wrong? The signposting was poor. The boards\nshould have interchanged\u2014this\ncould have been done at an inter-val. Most people were upstairs,\nbut there was no bar there\u2014and\nthe downstairs bar ran dry early.\nVITAL CHANGES\nLet's face it, organising a dance\nis far from easy. And precious\nPETER\nCARTWRIGHT.\nlittle thanks the organisers received\nfor their work, too. The greater\npity, therefore, that so much of\ntheir efforts should be wasted.\nSurely some lessons could have\nbeen learnt from last year. Bands\nof Phil Jennings style, however\ngood, are just not appreciated.\nTheir hire was surely almost a complete waste of money. Are\ntwo bands necessary? Would it\nnot be better to hire just one bet-ter-known group. Manchester and\nLiverpool Universities do it\u2014why\ncan't we? This group could play\nin the Concert Hall with sound\n\" piped \" to the upper refectory.\nAny unused costs could be met\nby increased entrance and better\nchecking\u2014too many came to this\nyear's Hop for nothing.\nAlthough it is difficult to find\nvolunteers, surely it is worth the\neffort in order to man a bar in the\nupper refectory. It has been done\nbefore\u2014your reporter has served\nat such a bar.\nJudging by the hordes of hand-painted posters be-spangling the\ncollege, people would be found to\nwrite a few simple direction signs.\nWIDEN THE NET\nMust the dance be such a cattle-market? The girls look like the\ndregs of Bedford College Life\n(with one exception). There are\nfar nicer girls\u2014not just the eternal\nstudents either\u2014at the hostels\naround Cromwell Road. Yet\nthere were very few girls from\nround there. Some more advertising there would introduce some\nvariety, at least.\nWe do not say the organisers\ncould have put more work into\nthe Hop\u2014it should, instead, have\nbeen better\u2014devised. And before any cries of \"armchair\ncritics,\" don't forget that many a problem is best solved by people\nwith an impersonal outside view-point.\nCompleted\nElected at an extraordinary\nCouncil Meeting were Barry\nMair (above) and Barry Utting\n(left) respectively to the ICU\nposts of Deputy President and\nSecretary.\n\n"

The emphasis is\nnaturally on the arts and current\na Hairs; the standard has always\nbeen excellent, and literary lectures and music recitals are particularly to be recommended.\nAs a follow up to the lectures,\nthere are particularly invigorating\nweekend discussions groups\nchaired by eminent speakers.\nThese are held in the sultry atmosphere of Silwood Park, with\nits stimulating surroundings, and\nsparkling inhabitants. People\nseem to go to more than one of\nthese so-called \" Touchstone\"\nweekends, so they must be worth-while.\n\" Touchstone,\" as a further sop\nto the arts, also organises theatre\nvisits which include a healthy\nsupper to which a leading theatre\ncritic is usually invited.\nAll you have to do is to go to\nsome of these lectures, and read\nthe extensive hand-outs, and, if\nyou are facing a particularly\ndreary weekend in dismal Battersea, you might find yourself down\nat Silwood Park, with lots to talk\nabout, and astound your friends\nduring the following week.\nFreshers'\nHike\nFourteen members of the crew,\nincluding a record number of\nFreshers assembled outside the\n\" George and Dragon \" at Farnborough, Kent, on the fine sunny\nmorning. Chris. Waterman led\nthe way in the general direction\nof South, heading for Cudham,\nwhich was eventually reached\nafter one or two questionable\npieces of map reading and traversing the usual quantity of\nfootpaths, private property (what\ngarden ?), and golf courses (4\nDunlop 2 Penfolds).\nThe party were suitably refreshed at the \"Blacksmith's Arms\" and set off at, a much\ngreater pace to the top of the\ndowns and then through Chevening Park to Chevening. It was decided to rest in a cemetery and\ndiscuss the graver issues of our\nforthcoming activities (giving the\nelder members of the party a chance to recover). We eventually\ngained the Polhill Arms and despatched two members of the\nparty to Keogh galley by car to\nconstruct a meal whilst the rest\nof the party followed by bus.\nBy the standard procedure of\nmaps and string we estimated the\ndistance we covered to be 12\nmiles.

It was mainly for\nthe poverty stricken student with\nan interest in this expensive hobby\nthat the Club was formed.\nThe Secretary has put in many\nwriting hours this summer trying\nto arrange a programme for the\n64-65 session with limited success.\nWe hope however to arrange a number of activities this year and\na meeting will be held on Friday\n23rd October at 5.15 p.m. \u2014Room\n342, Mech.

These are informal and\nsomewhat lighthearted, so you\nneed n't worry about looking a fool. (Some people purposely act\nthe fool). If you want to propose\na motion, just let the Secretary\nknow beforehand.\nMaybe you have an idea that\nyou don't want to expound in\npublic. If this is so, then why\ndon't you just drop in for a chat\nwith one of the Union officers.\nThe new executive have a difficult job to do, and any way that\nyou can lighten their burden will\nbe greatly appreciated.\nWho to see and where to find\nthem\u2014\nKish Sadhvani (President)\n57 Weeks\nChris Evans (Vice-President)\n432 Tizard\nPete Walton (Secretary)\n678 Selkirk\nDave Christopher (Asst.

Block on Tuesday, Oct.\n13th. When asked if the minutes\nshould not be signed, there was a unanimous \"No\" from the floor.\nHence the President was forced to\nsign the minutes. The Hon. Sec.\nthen announced the Co-responden ce, and elections were held.\nThis was followed by a strange\ngentleman, who claimed he was a Peeping Tom in the French Army,\nand proved it by giving details of\nMorphy Day on Nov. 4th. Despite screaming jets and a train, Pete Moss elated ly informed\nthe meeting that Bo would again\n\" run \" to Brighton for his annual\nweekend.\nThere was a good response to\nthe plea, on behalf of the Lord\nMayor, for Guildsmen to carry\neight foot tools in the Lord\nMayor's show on 14th Nov.\nAn immaculately dressed\n\" Monsieu Grote\" \" then showed\nhis Autumn collection of fashions\nfor Freshers. Especially attractive\nwas the Sporty Morphy Day en-sem ble, featuring the new shorter\nbooties with pre-stressed concrete\nsoles arc-welded to ceramic\nuppers and obtainable in five\npretty colours. The Yak haired\nunderwear featured by R.C.S. tickled most people's fancy,\n(especially the model's). The climax of the show was the\nGuildsman's coming out evening\ndress for the Engineers Dinner\nDance, produced in armour-plated\ntri nitro toluene, with spectacles\nby Focal.\nThe meeting then closed, with\nthe President undressing and successfully, if precariously, dismissing the Herculean task of Boomlaking. The meeting was then\nadjourned till Morphy Day, on\nNov. 4th.
