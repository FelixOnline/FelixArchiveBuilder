    "content": "FELIX, UNION COMMENT Editor', s Note: This is to be a regular\nfeature in the next hundred issues of Felix, or until the Union building is oom ple ted( whichever is the sooner) to bring to light the many blunders, both\nlarge and small of the contractors and\ntheir allies.1.) Telephones. If you ring KM2132 you get KEN 2963. If you pi ok up the receiver of KEN 2132 you hear no dialling\ntone (although this is a coin call box.)\nIf you pick up the receiver of KEN 2963\nyou hear a dialing tone (although this is for incoming calls only). But if you dial a number you don't get it. The G.P.O.( Post Master General Harpies) has been\ninformed.\n2.)\nBadminton. The Gym is too short\nfor Badminton , and while the Conoert Hall is long e nou gn, it is not high enough.\nFinancially this means a grant for the\nBadmington fans to hire external courts.\n3.) Stage. Stage front was found not\nto conform with L.C.C. fire regulations.\nConsiderable last-minute alterations were\nrequired.\n4-) Curtains. The Curtain tracks in the\nLounge were hung! in the wrong place. Hence\nthe shabby-looking pel mets of some of them.\nThese will be altered in due course. An\norf ical day of rejoicing may be ordered if this work is completed in the present\nSession.\n5. ) Main Door. The screen to the main\ndoorway was found not to conform with L.C.C. fire regulations. This might explain\nthe long delay in its completion.\n6. ) Radiators. The radiators in the porch\n\\of the main doorway to the ju ad were found\nnot to work. (In any case they only seem to heat the main quadrangle.) This may involve\nknocking a hole in the west wall of the\nSenior Common Room.\n7. ) President's Chair. A keen-eyed\nreporter notes that the crest on the\nPresidents chair has been stamped incorrectly. It is unlikely that this will ever be corrected.\n8. ) Table Tennis. The Table Tennis\nroom has a floor of highly polished wooden blocks. It is suggested that a permanent first aid outfit for broken\nlimbs be placed there.\n9. ) Windows. Not one sheet of glass\nin the Union has been cleaned . If the\npresent rate of dust precipitation continues, there will j soon be no need for curtains to cover them.\n10. ) Display Cupboard. Since it seems to\nhave been decided that this unsightly\ndisplay cupboard is to remain in the lounge,\nit is hoped that the large wooden doors\nwill be removed and re hung so that they\nclose properly. At present they have\nquite an appreciable curvature.\nJANE BROwN Special Student Lunches2/6 main, course Quickest Service in Kensington morning coFFee and tea330600% Exhibition Roa eL u AN EBRO V N11.) Magazines. There is a tendency\nfor paper magazines to get d is em bowled in their journey from the stupid table\nprovided, to the floor, and back again\nto the table. Also sometimes it is, virtually impossible to obtain a part icu lar magazine,eg. What's On, for one's perusal. If this is due to \"borrowing\"\nby persons unknown, we find it impossible to express our conte m nti npr in table language.\n12.) Miscellaneous. The designer of\nthe pavement outside the lounge has\nobviously never had practical experience\nin negotiating small but unexpected difference3 in levels after imbibing quantities\nof ale.\nReaders are reminded that at the\nUnion Meeting on October23 rd.1956, it was unanimously agreed that users of the Union Building should leave their hats and coats In the cloakroom before entering other rooms. It would help everyone If you would comply\nwith this resolution. Incidentally It is hoped to increase the capacity of the cloakroom with portable racks on\nthe left of the cloakroom entrance once the contractors have finished there. Obviously this rule need not be followed rigidly by people just pop-ping Into look at the letter rack or at a noticeboard It's a matter of using your own discretion. Anyone\nmaking a very brief appearance In the\nBar should leave his coat on the shelf just Inside the Bar door( to the right). CardS harpers please note that It was also agreed that the play j.ig of cards should be restricted to Lhe\nCards Room, which is on the second floor In the link with the Botany building./ TORE pp*n tar Jr rn r XX-XXX7(. 'Xth m aw arum d tiO Y V N Al\u00a3\nComments heard about the last Felix: \"It's been printed on \u00a35 note paper^\n\" It rustles too much in the lectures\n\"The print has taken better on\nthis paper.\"\n\"Surely you o an get this paper in rolls?\" \"Admirably grease proofed.

Sex (wacko 1) seems to be a fairly universal past time; in one of the\nladles' hostels of Leeds University, if a girl has a male visitors he must put her bed out in the corridor.

I.C. met\nCharing Cross and the Royal Dental Hospitals in the semifinal of the University Cup at Ha* ling ton.I.C. lost the toss and were set to face bright sunlight which proved very trouble some. Nevertheless I.C. showed them-selves to be more dangerous down the centre. Despite this It was the vis i tors who took the lead3 \u00abst before halftime when a surge of players caught the I.C. defence playing too square and carried the ball through to score. After the Interval Khan took the ball through acr pw ded circle and flicked it into the goal after several attempt s.I.C. continued to put on\npressure and took the lead a few min\u00ab\nute slater when Curtis ran on to a free hit from Owen. The opposition were not finished, however, and after a period of scrappy play a hard shot from their rightwing just went Inside the post to even the scores at two all. I.C. eventually broke away and were\nonly stopped when the umpire awarded\na penalty bully for deliberate kicking by the opposing full back. At the bully Curtis gave the defender no chance and put the ball straight into the net, and I.C. went into the final by a32 win. Results Sun. Feb, 3 rd.I. C.3:N't on Coll. of Tech2. Sat. Feb. 9 th.

Halftime saw the home side leading by six points and just after the interval the opposing right winger Increased the score with a fine try. The I.C. backs now began to lose the Inferiority complex which seemed to possess them in the earlier stages. Hearn scored a magnificent try which Stone did well to convert, and the last few minutes saw I.C. pressing hard with the score at98, Stone having added another three points with' a penalty. On the same day a tH arlington the A XV disposed of their opponents, Phillips SportsClub, by53 points to nil. It is not known how much of this mammoth score is due to the return lo rugby of that old master Dr.K.E. Weale.\nThe fill owl ng Saturday I.C. took on the formidable task of opposing Saracens Ex 1 st. XV a tH arlington. Our\npack, considerably lighter than that of the more experienced Saracens, did well from line out s and loose scrum s. A try following a kick ahead by the opponent's left winger, saw the score80 at halftime. In the second half the I.C. backs, faster than their opp on ents, came near to scoring on many\noccasions. I.C. ware pressing in the final stages but in spite of determined efforts we were denied any further score. With eight rugby teams at Harlin g* ton the quest for liquid refreshment after the matches was even more energetic than the games themselves, and by 8p.m. all the draught beer there was in the place had been duly consumed. The Judo Club's first practice this year In the new building was\nmarked by the traditional opening ceremony. \" K itch\" performed the first throw on Geoff Glee son,4 th. dan and Captain of the British Judo Team. Glee son levelled off two feet up and landed some time later with are sounding thump. K itch then declared the dojo open for the new\nyear, and in an exclusive Interview with our reporter he said that he\nwas quite happy about the beer in the bar( See page 1, Ed. )\nT.P.L egg ett6 th. dan,S.

On Saturday February9 th. Bristol University' s first two eights were\n. entertained at Putney. Races between\nthe first eights and the two second\neights were rowed off. In the first race Bristol and I. C.1st. eights started well at Hammers mi th Bridge and most of the way down\nto Putney it was neck and neck, each\ncrew trying to out sprint the other. At Fulham Football Ground however the two boats clashed and our first eight were put off their stride, losing about 1^ lengths. At this juncture in the race with three minutes to gc\nthere was little chance of the I.C. eight regaining their position and\nat the Stone Bristol were judged winners by1 g lengths. The second race of the day went to I.C. The second eight started well and soon built up a length lead. Bristol however .were not discouraged and\nkept I.C. boat working hard to build up a lead. At about 8-sr boke s from the finish the race was stopped owing to another eight crossing the path of the race, but I.C. were by then leading by two lengths and so were\ncomfortable winners.

    "content": "FELIX VIEWPOINT Most people have strong feelings about the New Union, although many do not express their opinion through FELIX. In view6 f this we\nare publishing twice as many viewpoints as normal. In these troubled times of expansion,\nthere are inevitable frustrations and .dis-'\nappointments and one tends to take slow\nprogress for granted. In these circumstances\nit is perhaps not surprising that there\nshould be a certain amount of apathy among\nstudents as a whole. However it is clearly of paramount importance that the student\nbody should voice its opinions, even on on\nminor matters, so that the pattern of\nCollege life will develop for the benefit\nof future students as the College grows.\nIt is rather disturbing, therefore, to\nnote that a recent memorandum requests that\nall press enquiries on 'general College\nmatters' should be referred to an Administ ration department which will be made responsible for official press releases.\nWhilst it is undesirable that a national\nmountain should be made out of a parochial\nmolehill, it is unthinkable that anyone\nshould feel bound to silence on a matter\naffecting student welfare.\nHot that I am advocating a press campaign for more hostels and refectories \u2014\nperish the thought. But it is this sort\nof directive which makes people think\ntwice about opening their mouths, thus\nincreasing apparent indifference and,\npossibly even giving those in charge the\nidea that all is well when, in fact, it might not be. There have been for example,\nmany muttering s about various rooms in the\nnew Union, but has anything been specifically stated\nWe must be careful to distinguish between general oo lle ge matters and Union\nmatters. I say that anything directly affecting us as students is primarily the concern of the Union, and it is up to all of us to help the Union offical s in their job and to let them know when things\nare not as they might be. Otherwise our\nrepresentatives will lose interest and the\nUnion might just as well become another\ndepartment of the Administration, not\nreflecting student thought at all. Union Meetings, the Union Offioe and\nletter racks are all convenient avenues of\napproach and remember that it is the weight\nof opinion which gets things changed - so\ndon't leave it to the other man. If y pu do\nhave an opinion why not make it known?\nD.F.

It is of course\ntoo late to protest against the use of\nbuilding ideas of the early twenties wh i oh has resulted, among other defects, in a serious lack of daylight, especially in the\nground floor rooms.\nTurning now to the interior decoration,\nthe treatment of the lounge can only be\nexplained if it is assumed that it is the\nwork of an entire amateur. How else can one\nexplain the overall feminine effect, with\nthe strong suggestion of a hospital waiting room Surely no qualified interior dec-orator, knowing that this room would be a meeting ground and a place of relaxation far a mostly male society, could have chosen\nthose frilly lower class over-bright lights those hygienically stark gleaming white\nwalls, that ponderous showcase and those\nuncomfortable and parsimonious chairs.\nWas the bar perhaps designed and built for a now abandoned public house along the Great\nNorth Road? Certainly it shows no great\nadvances in either style or concept.\nThe Lower Dining Hall suffers badly of\no our se from lack of daylight and a fee ling of space and airiness. It is difficult to decide whether the Upper\nDining Hall was designed for the holding of\nthe rites of Freemasonry or whether it is part of, in the parlance of our American\nfriends, a Funeral Home where we may expose our Loved Ones for the last time to\n-the'gaze of their friends.\nNo doubt it will be suggested that I am\nmerely an old diehard, upset because the\nold scheme of things; has summarily' been\nchanged. As however I have 's ard similar opinions expressed by other members, may I suggest that after the whole building is completed, you invite one or two well known interior decorators to inspect the\nUnion. Afterwards they should be asked\nto \"write, down their individual oom ment s, which could then be published\nIt is of course not for me to provide\nre a jodl es, but if the judgment of these\nprofessional critics is as I expect it to\nbe, may I be allowed as a Life Member of the\nUnion to make some suggestions for future\nre decorations: Engage a known interior decorator familiar with this type of work. Explain exactly to him, and make him see, by whom and how the\nroom or building will be used. Decide\nexactly how much may be spent on the work.\nAllow the decorator to do exactly as he\npleas\u00bbs. within the budget,.

Dr. Heywood took the chair and\ntold the Mech. Kng. Dept. joke.

For those who are\nunaware of these weekends and do not wish\nto remain in that state,we have unearthed\na few facts, and publish then in the hope\nchat we she.ll be able to render a public\nservice. They take place about twice a term\nand the cost is10/ or for those whose\nfinances are governed by beer, about seven\npints.\nIn exchange,you get free transport to and from Silwood, situate i'l the wilds of\nWindsor Great Park amid several picturesque\npubs; food, .farm fresh for the weekend, and\na bed that is sometimes comfortable. For\nthose who dislike talking for their beer,\nthere is a limited supply on o he premises.\n(We have been unable to ascertain which\nbrands of beer are available!)

SOME OF THOSE WHO SIGNED THIS PETITION HAVB\nsince confessed that they have never tasted t Flowers' bitter J This should produce an\namusing and interesting discussion at the\nnext Union meeting!\nMeanwhile, intensive research on the\nproperties of Flowers' bitter is in pro-gres s. This beer was served unannounced last Friday. Of twelve bar regulars\nquestioned, eight had not noticed any\ndifference, three thought it slightly-better than usual, the other thought it tasted like acorns (he later admitted\nhe had never eaten acorns). This brew\nwill be given a more prolonged trial next week, 30 call in and see what yom\nthink of it. A letter from Mr. Higson offers a solution to this problem. He writes, 'There\nare four taps in the new bar. I would like to see draught Worthington issuing from\none and Younger1\n3 Scotch Ale from another.\nThis leaves two other taps; perhaps someone else would like to suggest how these\nshould be used. I would not mind paying an\nextra penny or so per pint, but I am ready\nto agree that a cheap variety should be\navailable.' \u00ab 1\nIncidentally, critics of the condition of the bear may like to know that\nrepresentatives of two well-known breweries have declared that the beer served is in perfect condition. If you reo e ive a warm glas3 of beer shortly, after opening time, return it and ask the barman to pump more out to clear the pipes\nof beer which may have been la ving there\nfor some time. If you receive a \"cloudy\"\nglass, you should also return it. Either the barrel is nearly empty , or has not\nbeen given long enough to settle. The\nwriter's experience has been that warm oro loud y beer occurs only rarely in the new\nbar, and that the brewery representatives'\nopinion is correct. This is a great\ntribute to Dan Lloyd and Jim Anderson,\nwho have done so mu oh good work in the\nbar during Ted's absence.\nAlices CarWMja/i\\1 HAVEK'T YOU y^ OOT YOUR TICKET\nYET\nTry the Bar or Dick Hi ok s(Old Hostel)/% TOHIQHT\naac jt the,\nJ> a able Tickets IjfvintA.\nSilwood Park - the Country House\n(also see page 4, column 3)\nX HERE WE HAVE THE CAMEL*\nAbout two weeks ago, a prominent member of Silwood Park Union(composed off I.C. residents at Silwood), relieved Cambridge\nUniversity Agricultural Cpllege of a6ft. stuffed camel. This camel is being christened \"Nasser\" on Feb. 15th. About the same time, some mining geologists on a weekend field course erected\na lavatory cistern on the top of a pole by\nthe side of the refectory. Mines' colours\nwere painted on various objects wh i oh had\npreviously been adorned by those of C.&G. A letter complaining about thi3 was later sent to the Professor of the Department,\nbut this was received in true I. C.f ash ion: no action was taken.\nAnother incident occurred a week lat er, when these far-flung members of I.e., the Silwood residents, having tired of pranks with Royal Holloway College, challenged Bedford College to a Tiddleywinks\nMatch. An outstanding victory was record-ed.\nTwo of the above incidents were reported in SENNET. We are wondering why the\nphantom reporter- who is presumably an I.C. man or woman - did not consider his College\nnewspaper worthy of his news.\nENTER THE FELIX BEARD COMPETITION\nGentlemen, you have just over six weeks to prove to yourselves and the world that you can cultivate that most\nmasculine of attributes a beard.

On the other hand,\nreaders' views are representative of a cross-section of the College, and the greater the\nnumber of views expressed,the more will they\nreflect the true feeling of the College as\na whole. So 8on tin ue to air your opinions\nthrough the columns of FELIX, or, if you have\nnot already done so, write us a letter NOW!\nFREEDOM OF THE PRESS?\nLast week,the following letter was sen\nto the I. C.W. A. President: Dear Madam,\nIn recent y practice to allow' the lidl tor of Fell? or his appointed representative to be\npresent as an observer at General Coun c il, Social and [ Athletic Clubs, Refec tory and other committees; also it Is\nan accepted fact that he is permitted to be present at Union General Meetings Considering these precedents, I feel that it is somewhat anomalous for him\nto be ex lude d from' a meeting in which matters affecting the wellbeing matters which affect the wellbeing of\nt^il s college are discuss ea.I therefore wish to make a request that I, or my\nappointed representative, be permitted to be present at the General Meeting of\nI. C.V/. A. on Tuesday February12 th.I wish to point out that, as is the cus tom with other committees, information obtained at this meeting would be tre a ted in confidence and used for publication only if permission be granted by\nthe President of I.o.W.A. Trusting ths.t this request will be\nmet favourably, I. am,\nYours faithfully, D.J. H. Griffin. Editor, FuLl X. Th\u00ab following reply was received*-\u00bb\nDear Sir, It is quite unnecessary for you or your appointed representative to be present at either a General or a Committee Meeting of I. C.W. A.. Tf anything is decided at such a meeting that could possibly concern other members of the college, I will in form you of It personally. I consider your grounds for claiming precedents totally inadequate, and It rust that you will not see fit to continue this correspondence. Yours faithfully, Wendy D.S. Plpe\n( President I.C. VJ L.)oon t. In ns iz to at Usan.. \u2022 \u2022 .'\nFREEDOM CP THE PRESS Cent, from col.1A detailed reply to this letter has been\nsent to Misst Pipe,in j w hio hit was postulated\nthat, if at the I. C.W. A. meeting, matters were\nto be discussed which a ffe o ted other members\nof the College without the decision arising*\nfrom such a discussion being referred to another committee, for example Council, A.C.C. or S. C.C., there should be an independent observer present; otherwise, an observer would be\nunnecessary.\n^ So far, no reply has been received. Ne \u00ab\u00abBAD MANNERS\nDear Sir, Last Friday at 12.50 p.m., I observed in Ayr tai not less than two card games in progress\n( incidentally taking up two invaluable tables)\nand six people reading newspapers, which were\nspread all over the table. Some -as e, if a doubt\nful one can be made out far read ii: \u00a3 in the queue,\nbut certainly nothing can be said in favour of\ndoing so at t ne table.\nThe above in o on side rate and downright bad-mannered behaviour is not my idea r of what is to\nbe exp eot ed of students in a Uni-we rsi ty refectory.\nIt may be suitable for a Teohnioal College o an teen, but should not happen here.\nYours faithfully, A. Goodings.\nI. C.W. A. TO DAH-y Dear Sir, Monstrous end terrible rumours\nhave reached my ears this week.\nSoon after the Editor of Felix had\nattempted to enter the I. CUV. A. general meeting, the President of the Union unfolded a scheme whereby we are to be\nevicted from our comfortable lounge, which has been furnished by us and which, contrary to general opinion j Is quite frequently used by nonresident member;',\nof the association. We are, I believe to be banished to a remote, cold and rather small room at the top of the new\nBuilding. It seems only fair that this subversive scheme should be brought to\nthe notice of other responsible members\nof the Union,who will. l' trust. prevent any further action. Yours faithfully, Juliet Kennedy.\nThe following reply has been reo eiv ed from Mr. Kitchener:Ways and means are being considered of moving the Senior Common Room from Its present position which is, to put it mildly, extremely inconvenient to\nALL students. One possible way cf doing this is to ask the SCR to move to the present I. C.W. A. lounge, and ask I. C.W. A. to rise to the small lounge on the t pp floor. This of course would be impractical without the friendly cooperation of I. C.W. A. In view of I.C. W.A.'s large percentage of residential accommodation\nand the ext fem el v little use to which they put their new lounge, this scheme\ndid not seem unreasonable to me. Within j ne hour of the formulation of this idea, the President and Secretary of I. C.W. A. were informed of it not very\" subversive\" practice. Since th*y and other \u2022embers of\nI.C.K. A. have exhibited such furious animosity, the Idea becomes useless. Ways and means of moving the SCfi\nfrom It's present position are still being considered. CINE SOCTEn\nDear SirI have been very interested in the\nformation of a cine-society, with the main\nobject of making newsreels cf College life; we now have plenty of support, but no money,\nwith , I am told, very little likelihood of\ngetting any. It seems a shame that a pictorial record of the reconstruction of I;C. union cannot be preserved in the Union ar-chives.\nThink how pleasant it could be for aP.G. to look Back and say, \" I can remember\nthe day we bar racked Idberaoe,\" and then\nprove it to disbelieving listeners with a visual reo or d. Cine-cameras are used in various departments at I.C. for the filming of research\nactivities; why, therefore, could not cameras\nbe gainfully employed at some of the less\nofficial' re sea roh' oo cur reno es? I am sure that the society would serve\nmany people, but the difficulty, as ever, is finance.\nYours etc F.A.B. Editor's Note. Thre- years ago the Film\nSoc. had plans to make a newsreel of college\nactivities. Seme other colleges already make\na newsreel with a sound track on tape, w hio his shown at film soc. meetings. The production oost s are met by the admission charges.\nThere is no reason why a newsreel can\nnot be made at I.C. with the help of the\nPhotographic Soc., with support and funds\nfrom the rest of the Union. The newsreel\nwould be complementary to the stills already\npro duo ed and 30ld. However it is not usually\npossible to borrow equipment from college\ndepartments.\nFRUSTRATION ON FRIDAY'.\nJear Sir,I would like to complain in the\nstrongest possible terms about the nona vail ability ox Felix oi Friday 18th. It has been my practice to arrive on\nalternative 'Fridays in time for first lecture hoping to me st one of your\nattractive sales staff, who with her ready\nsmile would rel jd ve me of ray three pence. As is well known, this did not happen,\nand as o consequence, I suffered considerable mental strain in attending a lecture\nwithout something to read. If this happens\nagain, Is hall be forced to take legal ad\nvice. yog Pop uli THAT BEER AGAIN 1\nDear Sir, About t ne Beer Petition. I don't see why one member of the\nUnion should take it upon him a eli to name the brew required in the\nbar unless he has very special qualifications. Rather, let us have\na small committee of Bar Regulars to investigate the matter. It will, of course, be argued\nthat the petition proves that150 members want Flowers beer but I think many signed in an effort to\nget things moving.An admirable sentiment no doubt, but let us not\nforget that if we change -the Leer\nonce further changes will un doubt ably be frowned upon, if not\nre j eo ted. Let us attend to this matter with the urgency it d \u00ab;i and s but, i or goodness sake, lets do the job properly. John L. Sell ars,( Brerrery Labourer, Rtd\")\nCHANGE OF ADDRESS\nDear Sir,I now live here:-42 Queensferry Close,\nBil ton, RU<BT,\nWarwickshire.\nYours faithfully, K.J. Miller. "
