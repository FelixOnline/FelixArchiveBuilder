    "content": "FELIX\nPROFILE Mr. BREGAZZI. B. So. A.R.C.S. GENTLEMAN OP THE TOWN OP MIDDLESBROUGH.\nIt has often seemed strange to us,\nthat persons possessing the most multifarious talents, should be noted for one\nof these talents only. And, Indeed in the oas e of the gentleman we are today,\nas the modern fashion in English has it,\" profiling\", there is no violation of\nthis general rule. Having come from the\nmurky depths of the industrial North, he\nat once gained a certain fame as a player\nof that incredibly diff i ou lt and dangerous\ngame, to wit, water polo. His prowess at this sport was suo h that he was elected\nto the o apt a in oy of the Imperial College\nSwimming Club. Meanwhile, however, he had\nalso been active in the field of Rugby\nUnion Football, that game at which only\nthe strongest survive, and has now risen\nto eminence in this athletic exercise.\nIn fast he is at the present time, to* Captain of the Imperial College Rugby\nUnion Club, a position of much responsibility, and from this exalted spot, he\ncontrols the fortune and destinies of\nthis3 i ost excellent of the a th let io clubs1 of our establishment.\nHaving been questioned about his\nvein on life in general, he was strangely\nreticent, which is most surprising in view\nof his extroverted and, it might even be\nsaid, ferocious play on the field. He\nalso refused to prognosticate on the\nfinal outcome of the Gutteridge Cup\nCompetition, but one feels this is due\nto natural modesty as he possesses a team\nof al j. talents. His wonted ability to\nkick the spheroid long distances as was\nnot ioe able in that fine match against our\npoorer neighbours, King's College, has\nrecently, so we have been informed, deserted him of late. But practice, as\nthe old aphorism has it, makes perfect,\nand practice he certainly has. We would\ncommend to you, then, this estimable\nperson as worthy of notice and resp eot not merely as an athletic personage\nbut also as a research worker of considerable acumen and versatility. CLEMENTINE H Clementine II arrived quietly at\nits new home at1.0 a.m. on a freezing\nJanuary night. This was not to avoid\nlosing the mascot on the first night but\nthe result of a150 mile tow by a lorry only eight years younger than our vintage\nmachine.\nThe story began in almost \"Cops and\nRobbers\" fashion. While the driver and\nnavigator (Dick Howard and Ian Callow)\nwere discussing the influence of using\ndried blood as manure on the flavour of\ngrapes with the head gardener at Sheringham Hall, Clementine II was seen disC ALUS TORR BE John Braine achieved suo h extreme\nsuccess with his opening best selling novel that his name be o a me internationally\nknown. With this fame came the problem\nof all successful new writers; how to produce a further book without seemingly repeating the first. Ae far as I can see, this problem\nonly o cours to the successful. The lesser known writer can repeat and develop his ideas, bringing them forward from earlier books with little notice taken of the\nrepetition; whereas a best selling writer cannot afford to repeat anything if he\nwants to keep his high reputation.\nThe Author only partially succeeds\nin this, in his latest novel THE VODI\n(pr ioe16/). The main, characters are indeed exact\nopposites in his two books, the first being in love with success while the second dotes on failure. But the secondary\ncharacters seem to be much the same in both novels, each being set in a small\nNorthern town on the moors. However, even\nif this criticism is not totally valid, as\nobviously a writer can only write within his own experience, which in thi3 case is a North Country Society, one expects rather\nmore variation of theme than is provided\nhere.\nThe book opens with the hero, Diok\nCorvey, in hospital suffering from con-sump tion. We are told that he is slowly\ndying because he has no will to live. Then, by means of \"flashbacks\" in Diok\nCorvey's mind, John Braine tells of the\nunfortunate life of his hero.\nIt begins normally with neither\nsuccess nor failure entering it. Diok\nand his best friend play a game while\nthey walk to school each day. It is a at range childish fantasy of \"the Vodi\",\nan old obscene woman ruling a group of little men. The Vodi represents ail that\nis vicious and evil oppressing good in\nany form.\nDick grows up and the Vodi fades\nfrom memory. He achieves relative success.\nHis father's shop prospers, he has a secure\nfamily, money and a girl he is going to\nmarry.\nHis security is broken when his dies, and he contracts consumption. Finally his girlfriend gives him up. It is then that his mind returns to thoughts of the Vodi. He becomes obsessed with the\nidea. Wouldn't it be wonderful to be a magnificent failure, not just to fade into\nobscurity, but to fail absolutely.\nAt this point, when oom ple te failure is imminent he gets a strong desire for one of his nurses. This desire brings\nback his will to live and he decides to fight his illness. The book closes on him leaving the\nhospital and going out into the world again\nto fight for the love of the nurse.\nThis book, if compared with the previous novel, is certainly not striking. If, however, it is revised on its own merits it is a good study of small\ntown life. Dick Corvey's character is well established though most of the others\nremain somewhat weak.\nOn the whole, it is above the usual\n\u00bbrun of novels, but don't expect it tor jsa oh the heights of \"Room at the Top.\"\nappearing at great pace over the brow of\na neighbouring hill. The mascot gone\nwithout us! The owner of this Stately\nHome ordered his mechanic to rev up the\nPhantom $ Rolls Royce and with the skill of an experienced racing driver the chase\nwas on. Had they gone via Norwich or Fakenham. Just outside Holt we spotted\nthe curious train, a1934 Ford lorry towing a1926 Morris Commercial lorry( Clementine II) just taking a wrong\nturn. Half a minute later and we should,\nhave missed them.\niVe had been able to run Clem. II on\nonly 3 cylinders and to save damaging the\nengine further it was decided to have\nit towed back to London. We had waited\n2 days for our helping hand to arrive\nand when he did turn up we were not on\nthe spot. Anxious to get back to London\nhe coupled up the two lorries and set\nstraight off without us.\nThe journey was uneventful except\nthat we got lost around the rocket sites\nof East Anglia, the leading vehicle only\nhad side lights for half the .journey and\nno braking lights or u raf fic signals at all and one sporting woman driver tried to pass Between us at some traffic lights and was brought to an abrupt halt by the\ntow rope. We were so frozen in the cab,\nno aide windows, that we wore every\navailable scrap of clothing. On stopping\nat a cafe in Newmarket the woman immediately\nlooked the till and called for her husband.\nThe rest of the journey was continued\nin dense fog but we were helped by a convoy of monstrous carrot lorries who trapped U3 in their midst and guided us to\nLondon, In answer to many queries the\nportable harmonium on the platform was\nnot used.\nWe hope that after a complete overhaul and repaint Clementine II will be\non the road by March. According to the\nHistorical Vehicles Club there is only\none other such vehicle in existence and\nthat is not roadworthy. This 14.9 H.P. Morris Commercial was found in a Breakers\nlard in1954 and rebuilt and restored to its original condition. It appeared in the first commercial vehicle Rally at Beaulieu in1957. We hope to take the mascot on its first official trip to Camborne for the\nBottle Match.\nR.A.H. UP WITH BANNISTER'S SB WP VHS WA ill aAS Vr* A. it ill us if "

Flower bedecked Minesmen\nreturned to the Union with a view to\nbrightening the dance hall, and with the\naid of girl-friends, waste paper baskets\nfrom the third floor and miscellaneous\nhelpers, the hall began to resemble\nsomething like the wreckage after a carnival instead of a ballroom.\nEXPLORATION WEEK'( February 1 st to February 6th) Since 1956, when the Exploration\nBoard was first formed, there have been\n17 Imperial College Expeditions. From\nthe numerical point of view alone, this\nis a considerable achievement.\nTo illustrate the work which has\nbeen going on in this field, the\nExploration Board and Exploration Society\nare sponsoring, jointly, an exhibition\nof photographs, reports, instruments,\nequipment etc. This will be held in\nthe third floor lounge of the Union during next week (February 1 st to February\n6th) and will be open from 10.00 a.m. each morning, except Monday, when it will be opened by the Rector at 12.30.\nA publication, 'A Review of Imperial\nCollege Exploration' will also be on sale\nin the Union during next week. This is a collection of general accounts of some\nof last year's expeditions together with\nitems of more general interest. Price\n1/-.\nIn o on ju notion with General\nStudies, two lectures have been arranged\nduring the week. They are:-'The Explorer in Africa'\nBy Dr. Hugh B. Cott, Director of the\nUniversity Museum of Zoology,\nCambridge. Tue. 2nd Feb., at\n1.30 p.m., Concert Hall.\n'The South Georgia Survey'\nby Duncan Carse (ex Dick Barton),\nbroadcaster, writer and explorer.\nThu 4-th Feb., 1.30 p.m., Concert\nHall.\nFELIX\nBy eight in the evening, sherry\nparties sprang to life in many of the\nhostel rooms, and by the time these parties\nhad disgorged their contents into the\nUnion the Ball was well on its way. The\nearlier chaos had changed into ordered\no alm and the decorations were a fitting background to the occasion. Were these\ntuxedo ed gentlemen really all Minesmen?\nNot entirely as some members of the other\nColleges were present. Indeed the usual\nfive or so gate-crashers arrived; would\nany Union function be possible without\nthem?\nThis, however, was no ordinary Ball, for on this night there was a Cocktail\nBar, a Beer bar and a Coffee bar from\nwhich to purchase drinks. The latter emporium was ably run by David and\nJonathan combine. Dancing of all types\nwas excellently catered for by the band.\nHaving seen the photographs of the Ball several persons have approached the Mines'\nHon. Sec with a view to receiving less ons.\nWhat other Ball could offer a full meal with wine during the evening?\nMr. Mocney, apparently in the Christmas\nmood, provided an excellent meal in the\nmiddle refectory and the Minesmen rose to the occasion by consuming the complete\nstock of some varieties of wine.\nAt one in the morning the cabaret\nappeared in the disguise of Trevor\nP orr it t, Noel Reams, Tom King, John\nLoome and Andy Franklin with the invaluable assistance of Ian Callow.\nForgotten words only added to our enjoyment and tn is excellent cabaret was\ndeservedly acclaimed. These persons\nworked hard for our pleasure and to them\nwe would say thank you. At three,the\nproceedings came to an official close.\nFlowers saw the end out even as it saw\nthe beginning in \u2014 Chrysanthemum\neating being the final act of this great\nshow.\nIf you saw the photographs of the\nBall in the Union you will have realised that we had a great time. \"Excellent''\ncommented Ian Hill, and surely this is\"\nthe opinion of all those who were there.\nSo Mines have firmly placed this occasion\non the social calendar as a must.\nIt is hoped that Union members will walk round the exhibition, buy the\njournal, and support the lectures; and\nthat the popular misconception of expeditions as payed holidays will, to some\nextent, be rectified. WINTER UGH! Notes from the Suburban Country.\nA horrid cold hibernating month\nthis. Not much to be seen on the\nbird table except for a few bread\ncrusts, which can be seen just as\nwell in other months. The sparrows\nare skating on the water bath in\nabout as big a fix as a short-armed\ntrombone player, or a drummer with\nDermatitis on his skins.\nSpore tracks can be found by\nthe diligent searcher in the snow.\nThe spore is an uncommon animal,\noccur ing of course sporadically.\nThe prints of the spore are worthy\nof mention, sino e consecutive ones\nalways pointing in precisely opposite\ndirections. Three possible explanations of this phenomenon have been\npropagated. Either the animal has\none foot pointing backwards and one\nforwards Charles Chaplin style\n(Herniodactyl); or it spins round\nall the time; or is it just plain\nstupid. Sometimes specimens walk\non their hands (Pedodactyl), to save\nthe wear and tear on feet which are\nthen used as traffic at or s. WHAT'S ON OUT Ai\\D ABOUT\nJust released at the Academy Cinema\nis a film which may prove to be one of\nthe most astonishing exhibits of the oen-t ury. It is \"The Boyar's Flat\" and\nforms the second part of a trilogy drama ti sing the life of \"Ivan the\nTerrible\". It was produced by Eisenstein\nwho is almost certainly the greatest of\nall Russian film producers. First re leased in1946, it was initially censored\nby Stalin. The film conveys the whole atmosphere of the times, the suspicion and\nfear, the cruelty which Ivan is forced\nto use at moments of great national\ndanger. Brilliantly using dramatic\n\"close-ups\" and music by Prokofieff,\nEisenstein makes the film move in the\nform of an opera. Apparently very\ndeliberate, yet conveying the whole speed\nand tension of the situation. Every shot\nevery work and movement are designed ae\nas to produce the exact state of mind\nthat he wanted. Cherkosov as Ivan is a magnificent figure, using his tremendously\npowerful and adaptable voice to the full, he produces at ease states of rage and\nof pity. The programme at the Academy is superbly balanced by the supporting film entitled \"Greek Sculpture\". Directed by\nBasil Wright and photographed in Eastman\ncolour, it is one of the best films of\nits type that I have ever had the pleasure\nof watching. For once the comment a rv does not pander to the uninterested\naudience, nor does it make ostentatiously\ndiff i ou lt what they are trying to say.\nRicci. The Butterflies that were once\nso pretty in the summer are now rotting in the gutters and down the\ndrains. Snowdrops o an be found by\nthe keen Botanists (score 20 points)\nand in some cases may be pro l if io enough to trample through. Time\nfor the bluebell des ecr at or s of\nearly summer to put in a little pra ot ioe. Readers with an interest in\ntaxidermy should keep an eye on the\nnew motorway for specimens. A bird\nin the bush is worth two in the\nhand\nMeanwhile those who are tired\nof January s it down and wait for\nFebruary. It is a terrible time of\nthe year.\nCharles Neville. flaW\nWSBttmSBk\nj fit' *jgf tm mi THE6M IN. MARK& FAILURE "

Visions of South A fri can Wine Tasting evenings and perhaps the\nodd Jaffa Orange Sucking evenings seem to\nbe fading with the removal of this notice.\nIt does, however, stir me into thinking\nthat perhaps a supporter of the South\nAfrican Boycott has raised himself from\nhis apathetic posterior and performed a practical deed in the honour of his o a use. If more such supporters were to follow\nthis Stirling example and do something\nconstructive they would realise the ridiculousness of this boycott.\nCriticism of Apartheid seems to me\nto be unjustifiable without better suggestions for a solution of this problem.\nToo many people are willing to hurl abuse\nand criticise things inside and outside\nthe Union without lifting a finger to\nimprove something that apparently needs\nimprovement.\nIs this Union to sink into the current trend of becoming sick, sio k, sick.\nYours etc., etc.\nPaul L.

Transport free.\nFirst-timers or not ring:S PE2094R ACE AGAINST TIME You're wrong again folks, our\nPresident is not running away from it all. In fact there is a very good reason for his display of athletic prowess.\nAs a result of a bet, he stood to win\na goodly sum of money for World Refugee\nYear if he could run round the Island\nSite within six minutes. Our series\nof action photographs represent his epic\nsprint. During apr act ioe run Les Alien had clocked 6 minutes 15 seconds, so when\nhe set off on the actual run excitement\nwas rt. gh. Sad to relate our benevolent-av' ^.resident clocked 6 minutes 40\nseconds and had to contribute 2/6d to those with whom he had taken the bet.\nWhat the beneficiaries did with their winnings is not recorded.\nThe world of j az s as a whole, and\nespecially that part which is to be\nfound in Imperial College, reo ei veda great honour when it was revealed in the\nlast edition of Felix that Richard\nRushton had been awarded the Eugene\nQuills Award (1960) for piano playing.\nThis great triumph has sparked off considerable interest in this young musician and I intend to use this week's column in committing some thoughts about\nRichard Rushton, and the group he leads,\nto paper.\nJohn Richard Rushton was born in Wimsbey and like all good Northern lads\nhis first musical experience was with the\nlocal brass band. 0 Daddy, Rush blew\neuphonium in this koo-o ol outfit, but in spite of this the band hit the t qp s. This versatile musician still like store call these memories and is always wil ling to pick up an old battered tuba and\nblow the blues. And when this happens\n- Man, look out i like it's Birth of\nCool.\nIt is said that Rush was bom inside\na piano, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy of this fact, and even\nLeonard Feather in his Encyclopaedia\nof Jazz is non-commit al However,\nMan, Richard Rushton was digging the old Masters at an early age, and very soon he\nwas blowing a swinging box. This boy\nnotched grade 42 in his Eugene Quills Academy examinations, when Bop struck;\nlike Powl He heard Charles Parker and\nBud Powell blowing up a storm on The\nYolce one night and that was it. Like\nI said Man - like, Pow{\nAnd so it was like Rush was at the\nbase of Bop ladder, and after several\nyears he has reached the top.\nBut don't think that this cat's work\nis limited to the confines of Bop.\nAmongst his early idols were Jimmy Yancey,\nMeade Lux Lewis, Count Basie and Cripple\nClarence Lofton. And so Daddy, into\nthose ten digits of JRR is squeezed a complete history of jazz, and out oom es the style so personal and so full of soul.\nRichard Rushton uses his technique in the\nmanner of the late Art Tatum. In the\nhands of a lesser man it would be expressed as meaningless exhibitionism, but\nhere it is used to explore the full potentialities of the piano, and to transl ate an endless flow of ideas into logi o al improvisation.\nMan, like I dig the blues\nEspecially when it's cool.\n(Anon)\nThe combo which Richard Rushton\nleads is completed by John Farnsworth\n(bass) and Gordon Pritchard (drums).\nJohn was bom in Hemsworth and during his early days he blew a hot classical box.\nHe reached the ultimate in this sphere\nand then turned to strings; he played\nguitar in a Rock outfit and blew a solid bass in a Skiffle combo. He also bowed\n' cello for a while at this time. Like,\nyou might say that this boy's versatile. Just to prove this John now breathes\nplenty plenty soul into a trombone. But\nit's that big fiddle Daddy-O. That melodic walking line that swings like fury,\nthose bowed ensemble passages in ballads,\nthose up p ish solos executed with perfect\nease, those ideas that oo ul d have come\nfrom Oscar. Daddy, this boy sets me on\nfire. Like he swings , \u00abhj*\nGordon Pritchard is yet another\nNortherner. Now this boy's really blue\n-hot. His first tubs were made from\nbiscuit tins and banjo vellum s. On\nthese he practiced blowing skins; here\nwas a man dedicated to his work. And\nnow such is his standard that he can\noom ple te this exciting trio. Dig that\nstick-work man - every piano idea\ncompetently answered with strokes o. great nuance. Was that a mam my \u2022daddy\nboy? How skins and bass drive together.\nWhen this man blows brushes-then Man,\nit's like this combo has wheels.\nMan, like play me a Ana make it swing.\npax a diddle( Anon)\nAnd so we have three great musicians\neach understanding the other's musical\ntemperament perfectly, playing together\nas one entity, all dedicated to their art. Undoubtedly this is the greatest\noutfit 'Of this type in the Western Hemisphere.\nRimshot.\nwith apologies to John Staccato.\nMINES REJECT BOYCOTT At a Union Meeting on Thursday\nDeoember 101 J,^n ded by about 135 people,\nMines Union crushing ly rejected I.C.

Warren continued by pointing out\nthat the first person to be affected by\nan extensive boycott wo uia be the African\nnative, the person we,-were endeavour ing to protect and that no boycotts had been\nimposed on Hungarian and Chinese goods\nafter the bloodbaths of Hungary and Tibet.\nHe quoted the paradox of the Ghanaian\nGovernment's boycott of South African\nproducts until they found that 7 $\nof their mining equipment came from that\narea.\nN. Seldon seconding, suggested that\na solution to the Apartheid problem would\ncome only from discussions at government\nlevel. At the vote the above motion was\noar ried amidst loud applause by 108\nvote3 to 14 with 10 abstentions.\nThe other main business of the\nmeeting was the selection of a new mascot.\nAfter some discussion it was finally decided to adopt a1926 Morris Commercial\nlorry.

BARRON.\ncirculation 1300\ntd lUma l Q^m met it The University newspaper world,\nto say nothing of the University itself, was shocked last week when one of the\nLondon evening papers published a rival to Sennet. The idea of such a scheme\npassed through its embryonic stages to wards the latter half of last year; and\nwithout any Presidential sanction, the\nwould-be University contacts aided the\nLondon paper in its project.\nPrior to publication, many thoughts\nwere expressed on this subject, and the\ngeneral concensus of opinion was that\nSennet would not be able to compete\nwith such a powerful, and virtually identical format, newspaper.\nWhat to do? This was the big problem. Boycott, surely the most\nover-worked word in the English\ndictionary, came quickly to mind; but\nhow? The mental picture of a line of\npickets, around the news-vendor, borders\non the ridiculous; we could decide not\nto oblige the Editor with IC news, but\nthis would not deter, let alone prove a stumbling-block to such a large combine,\nas unofficial news is so easy to obtain.\nReactions around IC have been varied,\nbut on the whole negative. Despite the\nfact that we are continually snubbed by\nSennet it is the University's only news-paper, and as such should be supported in preference to, what can only be described\nas nothing more than a poor taste publicity stunt, hatched in order to boost\nsales among the in tell i gens i a of the\nUniversity City.

FROM y \u00ab U RICCI WRONG Sir,\nIt is generally considered to be bad\nform for any member of a theatrical company\nto take issue with a critic on the subject\nof notices, but since I personally was not\nconcerned in the Dramatic Society's presentation of \"Without The Prince\" perhaps\nI may be permitted to comment upon your\nnotice of that production.\nYour critic's views on the meaning\nof Drama are his own affair, but I would\nventure to surest th.-t, holding such\nviews, he would be well advised to refrain from dramatic crit io is m. The field of\ndrama is an exceedingly wide one, ranging\nfrom tragedy to low comedy. Your crit io's tastes may incline towards High Drama,\nbut the Dramatic Society, for its part,\nconsiders that a balanced repertoire is of more value, and of more interest to\nits active members, than a repertoire\nconsisting solely of plays of social significance. .\nYour critic at least is quick to\nle am, for all but one of the people\nwhom he singles out as giving performances \"of the nature that one has learnt\nto expect\" were fresher s, appearing\nfor the first time at I.C. As a\"lighting expert\" of some\nexperience I was particularly surprised by the concluding sentence.\nThe lighting of this production was by\nno means simple; if it appeared simple\nto your crit io, then the lighting designer had indeed done his work well. But if your critic expects a kaleidoscopic\ndisplay in a setting such as this, we shall continue to disappoint him. I suggest\nthat he turns his attention to Opera, where\nhighly mobile lighting can be employed with\nconsiderable benefit to the production.\nThis is not often the case in drama.\nYours faithfully, A.D.C. Shipley.\nRICCI RIGHT Mr. Shipley (of the above letter) would appear to be somewhat confused by\nthe subtle, nay obvious differences\nbetween drama and play acting. Quite\ncorrectly he points out that drama can\nrange from tragedy to low comedy, from\n'King Lear' to 'Bartholomew Fair'. With this I should not argue, but from\nthis obvious truism, he then takes the\nstrangely illogical step of saying,\ntherefore, all that is performed on the\nstage is drama. Perhaps Mr, Shipley\ndoes not feel that drama is an art form,\nperhaps he does not think that its purpose is not basically to tell a story but\nto investigate a situation, maybe he\ndoes not consider that it is necessary\nfor a state of conflict to exist between\nthe actors, and that what I call drama\n(he calls high drama) is rather starchy\nand long-hair i sh.Ift his is so,than\nnaturally 'Without the Prince' is drama.\nTo me it can never be.\nFrom this, he goes on to suggest\nthat because I do not hold his views,\nI should be for ever silent. From a presumably thinking person, this suggestion is so ludicrous and banal\nthat I don't consider it worthy of com-ment.\nBlindly gathering speed, he goes\non to tell me that I could not have\n'expected' any interpretation, as most\nof the performers were fresher s. Had\nhe read a little more carefully, he\nwould have appreciated that I implied\nthat we received the interpretations\nthat all previous actors and actresses\nhave used when performing these roles.\nThus stressing that there seen s to be\nlittle interest from the actor3 point\nof view.\nAs Mr. Shipley is, as he says a'lighting expert', it is not possible\nfor me to argue with him on this point\nand I should like to con did ion ally withdraw the statement. It was\nmerely my contention that a more inter resting play might have, given wider\nscope for these people.\nRicci BEN SPEAKS Dear Sir, That foul bilious attack on my\narticle' How to play Chesse ' was grossly\ninadequate and what's more quite untrue.\nHow can anybody criticise that most sacred\nof all games?\nIt goes without saying that the backbone of this or any other nation are the\nchest, players. Indeed, suo his the disgust\nat that letter printed in your last issue\nthat reprisals have all ready begun. Some\nchess players have even sent delegates to\nLondon to lobby their M.P. to propose a motion in the House of Commons that \"The\nsacred game of chess should be in violet\" Io all on the o hess players of the\ncountry to unite and again march against\ndictatorship, as they did once before\nwhen there was a shortage of wood.\nOnce again the peoples of the world will be able to move about freely without fear\nof being checked, for was it not Shakespeare\nwho said ' All the world is a chess board\nand all the people pawns'?\nI demand you to resign Sir, and stop\nthis perpetual checking, for if you do not?\nthis paper will become a little stale, mate.\nFinally, I would like to say that no\nmember of the chess club belongs to any\ngroup or sub-group, in fao tI sometimes\nwonder whether they are alive at all. Yours Resignedly,\nJ. Hindley.\nPresident of chess o lub. THANKYOU Dear Sir,\nI would like to congratulate\nthe person or persons who instigated the\nrearrangement of the furniture in the\nground floor lounge.It is a pleasant\nchange to get from one aide of the lounge\nto the other without disturbing the newspaper readers,and I find it equally pleasant not to be disturbed when I am reading\na newspaper. But why,I wonder,did no-one\nthink of it before?\nYours Sincerely, .\nHenry Mann.\nDear Mr. Barron,\nThank you for the Hostel\nEdition of 'Felix'. When is the College\nEdition coming out?\nYours sincerely,\nD. Goodman.\nS. Lenssen.\nR. Peart.\nP. Smith.\nP.J. Swash.\nMINES, I THINK "

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No 143\nFriday January 29th.19604 d STANDARD PROCEDURE On Tuesday 19th February a selection\nof London College Presidents and some\nULU officials were invited to a party in Fleet Street by the Editor of the Evening\nStandard. With one or two exceptions\nno one knew what the Evening Standard was\nplanning. The Editor arrived after the\nparty was well under way, and announced\nthat the Standard was going to publish a weekly supplement concerning University\naffairs. He considered that such a great University should have its affairs reported in a National newspaper.\nThose present, under the belief that\nthe article would be read by the whole of\nLondon, were enthusiastic, and thought it an excellent idea. What seemed to be a minor difficulty then arose; the day of\npublication was to be Thursday. This\nis the day that Pi, Beaver and Kings\nNews is published and the Standard\nagreed to meet the Presidents of ULU,\nIC, Kings, LSE, and UC to straighten out\nsuch diff ul ties the following morning.\nThese five Presidents decided to have a quick meeting at Kings that evening to discuss what their attitude should be.\nAt this meeting it became clear that the\nStandard had planned these articles without reference to the President of ULU\nor any other official in the first instance, but had discussed it with Mr.\nJ. Spellman, ULU President of Debates, who\nhad neglected to tell the ULU Executive.\nThey had however found out that something,\nwas afoot. Secondly the President of IC\nhad found ou\"t that contrary to everyone's belief the edition would not be on sal e all over London, but only to students,\nthe Standard's idea being to sell it if possible inside the various Unions.\nSuch a publication clearly threatened the\nexistence of Sennet. It was decided to find out from the Standard the following\nmorning:- i) What power did Spellman still have. ii)Was it only a limited edition to students. iii) Did they realise that they\noo ul d only sell in the Unions with the\npermission of the various Union\nauthorities.\nAfter this meeting they said that\nthey reserved the right to get information from anyone they wanted, that they\nwould help us and we oo ul d help them, but\nthat they would print exactly what they\nsaw fit and what they printed was none\nof our business. The edition was to be\na limited one, five-thousand copies on\nthe first day with the hope that it would be increased in future. They\nhoped to sell it in the Colleges, with\nour permission of course, by means of\nstudent vendors whom they would pay.\nEventually they would try and sell it to the public when and if the public\nshowed any desire to buy it. The\nPresidents present agreed to go back\nto the Standard on Monday 25th January\nhaving consulted their executives and\nhaving seen the first issue of the\npaper.\nThe IC Executive have decided, in view of the fact that it is clear the\npaper will be only sold to students,\nthat it has no value to the University.\nConsequently it has decided to refuse\nto let it be sold in the Union, if it is sold outside the Union IC will not\nprovide sellers, and finally no official information concerning IC affairs will be given to the Standard. These dec is ions were made tentatively to allow\nroom to fit into any scheme that ULU and\nthe other Colleges had in mind.\nThe President spoke to other London\nPresidents informally on Saturday 23rd January, and it appears that other\nColleges share the IC viewpoint. The\nULU Executive feel in the same way, and\nintend now to find out if the Standard\nwill come to an agreement about what\nshould be published and how and when.\nAlso they intend to find out from\nother newspapers if they would object\nto a suitable agreement between the\nStandard and the University, for clearly if they would such an arrangement cannot occur. It is clear then at\nthe time of writing( Sunday 24th Jan)\nthat the Colleges and ULU intend to put\nforward a solid front, and to show that\nit is the students who count in London\nUniversity and not what a National newspaper cares to say or write about them.\nIn all it loo l.s as if the Standard has\nbitten off more than it can chew. Aol iche worthy of jt s own writers.\nANOTHER BLOODY APPEAL Very soon a campaign will be started to enrol Blood Donors\nfor a visit to I.C. of the National\nBlood Transfusion Service.\nThe H. B.T.S. is a State financed\norganisation relying solely on the\nvoluntary support of members of the\nsociety it benefits. The State can\nextort almost anything from the private citizen, but not yet his blood.\nThis does not mean that a supply of\nblood is unimportant. Over 800,000\nbx ood donations were made in the last year\nand more are needed this surgery becomes\nmore universally effective, road accidents\nmultiply, new uses are found for blood\ntransfusion every day - the demand for blood rises all the time.\nThis is one good cause that nobody\ncan dispute and in which a small effort on your part may mean perhaps another\nlife saved. The fact that it is a voluntary service leaves the responsibility for its success entirely in your hands.\nIt will be interesting to see how many\npeople at I.C. are prepared to do some,\nthing for no material reward.\nGIVA PINTA BLOODA QUAETA\nON YOUR MARKS "

    "content": "SEDAN SAGA On Friday January the 22nd, as all readers of the News Chronicle know, a race between a sedan chair and a sports\noar took place in the City. The race\nwas organised by Lil li put and the occupant of the sedan chair was Kiss June\nThorburn. The eight bearers were all lawyers from IC (whatever they may be)\nand ran (or staggered) in relays of two.\nLil li put in the best traditions of\nEnglish sport divided up the route by\npubs into five stages.\nAfter a number of photographs had\nbeen taken, the race was started by the\nfirst pair, Alan Goodliffe and Jim\nCarter, who were in eighteenth century\ndress. They carried Kiss Thorburn as\nfar as \"Ye Olde London\" (lounge rs) where\nGerry Ridgeley and Tony Gifford took over.\nThe first two were then rushed by car to the \"Cheshire Cheese\" (Free House) for the last pick up. Meanwhile, the sports\noar (Lotus) had disappeared in the dist ance. At the next change \"The King Lud\"\n(Whitbread) Peter Kassler and John\nDewey took over. They handed on to Tim\nDhonau and Brian Young, who dropped the\nchair once (and Miss Thorburn) who\narrived at the \"Cheshire Cheese\" to find an exhausted next pair, Alan Goodliffe\nand Jim Carter, awaiting them.\nAfter a short rest, these two reached Dr Johnson's house in Gough Square\n10 seconds before the sports oar. An\naltercation between one photographer\nand the bearers developed, when, for the purposes of obtaining a better photograph, the bearers were requested\nto run the last twenty yards again. A reception was then held in Hulton House\nwh i oh surpassed anything seen there for some time. The bearers departed in a drunken state and, so far as is known got\nback in safety.\nTwo comments to end with. Both ByMiss Thorburn. The first was, \"I'm not\nvolunteering for this sort of thing very\noften\", and the second, \"Nobody will believe me when I tell them where I got\nthese bruises.\" Never mind, Miss\nThorburn, we will. FELIX\nSTANDARD STATISTICS A mighty fanfare on the pub-li city trumpets of Fleet Street\nheralded the appearance of the\nEvening Standard, University of London\nEdition. Four out of the paper's total of twenty pages were devoted to the\nUniversity, and an analysis of the actual\ncontents is illuminating.\nOn each page of the paper there are\n90 column inches, so that the total devoted to the University was 36O column\ninches. Of these 74\u00ab3 column inches\nwere devoted to University news, 128.6\nColumn inches to photographs of students,\nan article on Professor Masaey, head of\nUC physics department, 4J6.A,o ol um n inches\nand adverts 68 column inches. The rest of the four pages were taken up by\nheadings and gaps. These figures, expressed as percentages of the whole paper\nwere:-1) Student news and photographs,\n12.72 %\n2) Art iole on Professor Massey,\n2.58 %\n3) Total a cl vert is ment s( of the whole\npaper) 869.2 oo lu mn inches, or\n48.29 %\nThe articles \"In London Last Night\"\nand the Society column totalled103 column inches, of which 22 column inches\nwere devoted to a singularly weak cartoon.\nExpressed as a percentage, 5.85 % iI quote these figures without comment.\nstandard. The back page consisted of\nphotographs of students and their views\non religious education in schools; and\nthat was that.\nIf the Evening Standard wishes to sell this edition regularly, as is their intention, I believe, then they might do\nwell to remember that monosyllabic\nplatitudes and tepid comment will not\nendear them to students, who, on the\nwhole prefer lively discussion and vigo rous criticism. One final comment, Sennet's usual\nhabit of leaving IC out in the cold has\nspread to Fleet Street. The total ment ion of Iff, including Basil James on the\nsports page ran to3.1 column inches\n(i.e.1.53% of the total ULU new e). IC\nI would remind you, eaters for about 10 %\nof the ULU population.\nSince this art iole was written, the\nfollowing letter has been drafted to the\nEvening Standard:Sir, We would like to express our disgust\nat the way you are using our University\nas a peg on which to hang your latest sales-drive.\nSurely you could have given us a revealing view of the private life of\nsome \"personality\", or serial is ed yet\nanother bestseller, or employed any of\nthe other tawdry routines used by second\nrate newspapers to sell more; anything\nrather than resort to the sickening\npractice of involving the largest collegiate University in the world in o heap commercialism.\nNow let us consider the articles in detail, I mean of course, those connected\nwith the University, for the other 16\npages were typical of evening newspapers,\nand not worth reading. On the front\npage was a rambling review of ULU, wh i oh reminded me of Shakespeare's''t is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nsignifying nothing'. The middle pages\no on tai ned the article about Prof. Massey\nwhich was bearable, an article about\nsport, which wasn't, and some jottings\nwh i oh were of the Felix Confidential\nWe suppose it is having the desired\neffect since many of us have bought\ncopies from the men specially posted outside the Union 30 that we could \"see ourselves in the papers\".\nWe appreciate your desire to sell your newspaper, but layoff London\nUniversity l Yours faithfully, A. J. Ablewhite\nC.J. Blowes.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK Life at College, away from the Lecture theatre, is essentially social. Which type of education best prepares the\nstudent for this? Is it the Grammar\nSchool or Public School?\nThere are more students in the\nUniversity from Grammar Schools than\nPablio Schools. You may, therefore, be\ninclined to think that if the social pattern is set by the majority, the\nmajority is best suited to the social life. You may be right, but just\nbriefly let us examine the two forms\nof education and their effects upon a man's outlook and character.\nThe essential difference is that a Public School is generally a boarding\nschool, a Grammar School is a day school.\nSo the Grammar School boy spends\npart of each day with his parents and\nfamily. He KJIOWS tn at after school\nhe can go back to the security of his\nhome. This cannot help him to develop\nself-confidence. On the other hand,\nhe mixes with a broad cross-section of\nsociety both in and out of school. He\nmeets older and more mature people than\nhimself. At the same time, however, he\nbecomes acutely conscious of class distinctions. The fact that the lub li c School boy\nis away from home in duo es him to provide\nhis own security by becoming independent.\nHe has no one to provide sympathy and he\nlearns to look after himself. So he\ngains a great deal of self-confidence.\nHe mixes mainly with his own type, and\nso he is less aware of cl as3 distinction. These attributes together enable him, on\ncontact with the world outside his cloistered existence to talk with all types of\npeople without embarrassment.\nWhich type of man moulds most easily to University life? Is it the Grammar School boy, who\nhas mixed widely has a broad outlook,\nbut who is not self confident? Or is it the Public School boy, with his independence, self confidence and polish, but\nwho has not mixed so much?.\nI believe the self-o on fide no e of the\nlatter overcomes his inexperience of\nmixing and fits him best for the arduous\nsocial life at College.\nI wonder what I. C.W. A. thinks about\nthis? They should be impartial judges.\nGO MANGO "

    "content": "e FELIX SOCCER The outstanding item of news in the\nSoooer Club at the moment is the winning\nof a Welsh International Cap by Basil James, the University Skipper and IC Cup\nstalwart. The Club, and I am sure the\nwhole College offer their congratulations\nand hopes that this is the first of many\ninternational honours to come his way.\nSince the last Felix report came\nout, the Club tour to Germany has taken\nplace, and on the whole it proved suo-o ess ful in every respect except one -ask any member of the tour and he will give you half a dozen reasons why we did not manage to win a game. The real reason I suspect is that the teams we\nplayed were prestige sides for their respective Universities, and included\nsome of the be3t student teams in Southern Germany - hence the standard was very\nhigh.\nThe train journey to CoLogne passed\nune vj ent fully, and having spent the night\nthere the party picked up two VW minibuses and drove down the Rhine Valley to Mannheim in bright sunshine. Here we\nwere entertained royally during a two\nday stay, in spite of the threat of being chucked out of the hotel on the first night. The match here was played on an\nicy bone-hard pitch, and in a snow storm,\nthe o old spell in Germany having just\nstarted. IC made a bad start and were\n3-0 down by half time. A great second\nhalf rally, however, took them to a43 lead, only for Mannheim to equalise and\nthen scored the winner in the dying\nseconds of the game.\nThe following afternoon we drove\nrather unsteadily through Heidelburg,\nthe Oxford of Germany, soon beguiled by\nthe vague is lightly off-hand charm of the\ntown wh i oh nestles in a beautiful mountain setting with snow covered\nheights on three sides. High up above\nthe town stood the famous Sohloss or\ncastle where even the hardiest IC\nvisitors were taken aback by the giant\nwine barrel wh i oh holds 45,000 gallons\nand has only been filled completely 3\ntimes in300 veers.\nIC fielded their weaker team against\nHeidelburg thus making sure that everyone had at least one game to remember -and how we remembered l In spite of a bright sun the temperature was several\ndegrees below zero and the so called scratch Heidelburg XI included four\nsemi-professionals. Once again after a bad start in the first half IC played\nmore intelligently and more vigorously\nlater and held their skilled opponents\nto a score of 4 - t. RUGBY FIVES Some people may have noticed the\npeculiar buildings being erected in front of Weeks Hall. These, for the\nbenefit of the less well-informed, are\nfives oo unt s, a gift from the Rector to\nthe Union.\nThese courts are only intended to be temporary, but may be with us for three or four years. It has been\ndecided to form a Fives Club as a subsection of the Squash Club until the new\no lub can stand on its own feet.\nThe courts should be finished soon,\nand if anyone is interested, they can\ncontact me through the Union rack or in my room, 62 Weeks Hall. A list will also be posted in the Union. I hope\nthat the Union may also be persuaded to\nprovide equipment for those people who\nceased to play the game when they left school.\nB.N. Heywood.\nSPORT Reluctantly and with sli in mer wallets\nwe left Heidelburg having tasted here\nwhat was described as almost the best\nbeer in the world and having completely\ndevastated a fine old student drinking\nhouse called SeppL with our tuneful ( i)3 ing ing. Outstanding was a song-and.\n-dance routine entitled \"Green grow the\nRushes, Oh\" which was enacted on the\ntable tops with such fer v our that it almost literally brought the house down.\nThe brisk efficiency of the technic-al University of Karlsruhe contrasted\nstrongly with the fairytale atmosphere\nof Heidelburg. The excellent meals and\nthe good accommodation situated in a splendid sports stadium complete with\ngrand-stand, indicated how well organised\nthe Karlsruhe boys were from the sporting\npoint of view. This they further\ndemonstrated the following day when a side including 2 d tu dent internationals\nand the Karlsruhe professional o lub reserve goal-keeper played extremely neat\nsimple football to record a50 win.\nThe IC team fought hard to keep the score\nto 1-0 at half time but faded somewhat\nin the second 45 minutes.\nA night on the town meant that some\npeople arrived back ju3t in time for an\nearly start to Cologne at 5 o'o look the\nfollowing morning. After a flat out\ndrive along the Autobahn one VW blew up,\nabout 10 kilometres from Cologne but\ncarried on with just sufficient strength\nto get us back to the garage.\nAfter a qui ok train journey we spent\nthe night in Brussels, still resplendent\nand lively from the 1958 Exhibition, and\ntravelled back the following day to\nLondon.\nThanks are due to our German hosts\nwho treated us so very well and to all the tour party who a quitted themselves\nadmirably, and helped maintain IC's excellent reputation abroad.\nLack of space prevents the inclusion of team reports and results in this art iole, but it is hoped that all team\nmembers will o on tin ue the good work and\navidly read about their mighty and heroic\nefforts in the next issue.\n. D.F. RUGBY A Few More Words (j) Below are shown the records of the\nseven Is0. rug ger teams up to and including Sat. 16th January.\nPW LD FA1st Team 21 14 6 1 235 113\nEX 1st104605593\" A\"953110372 EX \"A\"954014086B170703669B284406687 B310103638155J5_ Although the records may not appear\nto be individually very good the club as\na whole is comfortably on the credit side\nand settling down to some good steady\ndr inking.\nLast Wednesday, Jan. 20th, the first team played U.C. and lost36. As there\nappears to be a good chance of I.C. meeting U.C. in the Final of the Gutteridge\nCup this result might cause alarm in certain quarters. I don't think however\nthat This alarm i3 justified be o a use I.C. was beaten not by a better team but by\nits own lethargy. The following Saturday,\nJan. 23rd, saw I.C. in completely different\nmood in a game in which the team showed\ncomplete mastery over a strong Harlequins\n\"A\"te an v If it is possible to pick out individuals in such a fine display then\nparticular mention must be given to the\nbao k row trio of Fisk-Gllbert-Berger wh i oh played outstandingly both in attack and\ndefence.\nSaturday 23rd Jan. must certainly be set down as a memorable one for the\nI.C. club for out of 3even teams six won\nand one -drew, a feat which I believe has\nbeen equalled on one other occasion but\nnever surpassed. The B3 team brought\nabout a \"near miracle\" by beating Charlton\nPark with 11 men. It is reported that\nBaoyn3ki and Carter rampaged and Ludlam\nscored a try only be o a use he was faster\nthan everybody else.\nCROSSCOUNTRY I.C. WIN TROPHY\nThe first fixture of the term, amato h against London Hospital over our\nhome course at Petersham on Wed. 13th, soon sorted out those members who had\nkept up their training during the\nChristmas Vacation from those who had\nbeen taking life easy. Notable among\nthe latter were the Captain and the VioeCaptain. The match wa3 won, however, by\na wide margin, due no doubt to the opp-os it ion being in a similar state of fit ness. First three places were occupied\nrespectively by John Conway, Dave Hammonds,\nfind Pete Warren,\nThe third team disgraced itself on\nWed. 20th by losing to the Royal Veterinary\nCollege second team at Petersham. First three places were occupied by members of\nthe opposition. In fourth pla oe was Brian\nButler followed by Roger Woolf (5).\nReading University and Sandhurst Military Academy provided weak opposition in a match held at Sandhurst on the following\nSaturday. John Cleator, was first home for I.C. followed by Pete Warren (4), Dave\nHammonds (5) and Alan Brown (6). Final scores were I.C.45; Sandhurst 62; Reading\n66.\nConditions\"were soft and slow for the annual 7'j mile race organised by\nQueen Mary College and run over a course\nat Coxtie Green near Brentwood in Essex.\nFull results are not yet available but\nThe John Banks Trophy for the first London College was won by I.C. In the\noverall team placings Cambridge Univers it y were first with 93 followed by Birmingham University (108): Imperial College\n\"A\"(116); and Sheffield University (178).\nThe first individual to cross the finishing line was Keith Mito hell of U.C. followed\ntwo seconds later by our own John Collins. After a further gap of 21 seconds Shaw of\nBirmingham and Fruin of Cambridge came in equal third.

Ski\nOlub to the mount sins found us this year\nIn Saas Fee, & small Tillage some 6000\nfeet above sea level in the Valais\ndist riot bf Switzerland, which proved to\nbe an excellent choice from every\npoint of view. Perhaps the most important\nadvantage was that, unlike Kltzbuhel the\nyear before, there was snow in abundance,\nand the skiing conditions were excellent.\nThe majority of the party travelled by train, leaving London early on 29th Deo., and passing through Dover, Ostend,\nBasle and Berne on their way to Brig. Perhaps the only major excitement on\nthis part of the journey was the unintentional pulling of the communication cord\nby one of the party before the train left Ostend, wh i oh produced not only deep wai ling and rushes of Mighty Wind from the\nbowels of the train, but also a flurry of\nofficialdom.\nProm Brig the party travelled by rail to Stalden, there leaving the route to\nZermatt and enjoying what was perhaps\nthe most exciting hour of the holiday, in the form of a bus journey up the side of\na valley into Saas Pee. On many occasions\ndid the party resign itself to what seemed\nan inevitable fate, and discussion centred\non terminal velocities' of falling buses.\nI to a me as no surprise when, on rounding a bend, a snow plough was seen to be blocking\nthe road, its driver having gone to lunch.\nIn spite of this and the fact that the bus\nthen ran short of petrol, I.C. turned up\nin Saas Pee apparently little the worse\nfor wear.\nThe small party \u00bbho travelled by air( that quick, modern, eff io i ent way) landed\nat Basle instead of Geneva and had to make\ntheir own way from there. Reports are\ncirculating that one member of the group\nspent his holiday in Montreux. But most\nof them arrived.\nOnce in Saas Pee, the party divided\nthemselves into three Pensions. It is reported that the porter who carried the\nluggage to the Pension Supersaxo, wearing\na Supersaxo cap, then changed his o ap and\nperformed a similar service for the guests\nat the Pensions \"Alpina\" and \"Garni des\nAlpes.\" This Ica i mot deny.\nProm then onwards followed eleven\ndays of wonderful skiing, enjoyed a like by beginners and more experienced skiers*.\nThere was one long run for good skiers,\nfrom the Lange Plua Hut, down via SPIELBODEN into Saas Pee, a fall of 3,500 ft. If Saas Pee had some alternative long\ndescents early in the season; one could\nregard it as a Utopia for skiers.\nTrue there were other attractions on\nthe slopes, and everyone will by now have\nheard of the young lady who, realising that the sitting position, occupies much\nof the beginners time, determined that\nshe would do so as near as possible to her charming instructor, who then had the\nexciting task of picking her up. However,\nin spite of frivolities, most members of\nthe party left Saas Pee more proficient in the art of skiing than when they arrived. Some even gained experience in crossing\nglaciers roped together and in spending\nafternoons in sub-zero mountain huts.\nWe poor students' found that the\norganisers had imported professional\ncard-sharp3 instead of ladies and Tie\npops y even had her own loaded poke.'\nd loe OhS How do you play it? didn't hold water for many nights - disciples of\nBilk o. The party enjoyed some very gay\nevenings, among3 t which the evening spent\nat the Walliserhof will long be remembered, if only for the vast quantities of\nwine and Fondue consumed and the impromptu piano work by Patsey which had\neveryone on their feet, even old Peg Leg\nPercy, dancing a cunningly executed \"Rock.\"\nOn several occasions nocturnal rides\nwere enjoyed on sledges, much to the\no on stem ation of the loo al police. Trials showed beyond doubt that a sledge travels\nfaster the more people you have on it. BEAU TIC WAR I ANN26AN N HOD NET T But although much research was done on the\nmatter no satisfactory method of steering\naround 90 degree street corners was est-a blis he d. Also there seemed to be only\none way of stopping in a hurry and it was\nvery painful. Accidents were few, and slight, but\nfor two rather notable exceptions. In fact skis suffered more than skiers; a certain I.C. man found it difficult to\nsteer himself between two narrowly-spaced trees: he lost half a ski but kept\nhis leg,( only to break a bone in his foot\nthe next day).\nThe journey home was uneventful,\napart from the annoying delays in the\ntrain schedule. But everyone was prepared to put up with a little inconvenience, considering it small repayment\nfor such a fine holiday.\nSQUASH CLUB Both squash teams got sway to a good start last Saturday by beating\nCardiff University 1st. and 2nd. teams\n5 - 0 and 3 - 2 . The 1st, team mato h was something of a foregone conclusion\nsino e we had our strongest team out,\nand only one game was lost in the five\nmatches played. The second match,\nhowever,provided one of the most closely\ncontested for a long time. Most\nof the glory goes to John White,\nwho played last with the score in\nmat ones22. Things went badly to\nstart with and he found himself 0-2\ndown in games and 2-7 down in the\nlast game; whether it was the voc-if ero us, irb eery support from a much\nmore crowded gallery than usual, I don't know, but suddenly he became\ninspired, fighting back to win the\ngame 9-7, then the next game, and\nfinally the last game to win the\nmato h32. Mention should also be\nmade of Ged Brough, who gallantly\nsame in at the last moment, and\nproved himself to be well! worthy of\nthe plane, by winning his mato h suite easily.\nOn Tuesday our \"A\" Team re oie ved. crushing defeat from L.S.E. In\nest years they have played the 2nd team, but this year they are particularly strong and deserve a1 st Team\nfixture, wh i oh we hope to arrange\nlater this term. Both the Captain\nand Secretary played at short notice and were defeated in two good\nmatches; they were the only people\nto get games off their opponents.\nThe 1st team will have to play\nwell if they are going to win, and\nI think it should prove a very o lose mato h, whichever way it goes.\nNext Monday the 1st Round of\nthe U.L. Individual Championship is to be played off at St, Mary's Hospi tal. Six players are entered -Messrs Avient, Espig, Odell, Bullock,\nHaywood, and Creasy - and we wish\nthem luo k particularly Brian Avient\nwho has the job of \"tripping up\"\nMike Kingston, the University\nCaptain. Also the Club is due to\nplay U.C. in the 2nd Round or the\nTgleeias Cup - 3 a aids College com\npetition - sometime within the next\nweek or two. This should prove to\nbe a close match.\nMost of the 2nd Round of the\nWhitely Cup\u2014 College Individual\nChampionship - have now been played\noff, and it is hoped that the third\nround can be arranged for Wednesday\n3rd, Feb. There were 4\n.\n1 entries\nthis year including two young ladies\nof I.O.W.A., one of whom Brenda White\nwon her first round easily and com-fort ably, to be defeated in the second by Ronnie Creasy, whom, y Hm glad to say, she made do quite a bit\nof running.\nFENCING The fencing club now meets for two hours on Thursdays 12,30 - 2.30 p.m. and not, as previously, on Mondays.\nLast term's matches were nearly all cancelled but we hope to play a few more\nthis term, and with greater success.\nBeginners and experienced fencers\nare welcome to join, professional instruct ionis given.\nTHE LAST LAP "
