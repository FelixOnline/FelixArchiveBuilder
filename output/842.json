What could be better than a visit to the Victoria and Albert Museum...\nA voluntary donation of just 50p gets you a natty\nlittle sticky badge, which gives you access to a wonderland of permanent ex h ibt ions from jewellery\nto sculpture as well as a number of temporary ones\nwhich change regularly.\nOn a recent visit, I spotted 3 glass cases and a banner bearing the initials 'ICCA'. Further\ninvestigation showed these mysterious 4 letters to\nstand for 'The International Correspondence of\nCorkscrew addicts.' The'3 cases contained literally\nhundreds of corkscrews, the most interesting of\nwhich doubled as a shaving brush.

I heard a very ironic\ncomment from one middle-aged lady who noticed a copy of one of those magazines kept on the top shelf\nof newsagents and turned to its centre fold.'

    "content": "An Imperial student describes one solution to the overseas\npostgraduate accommodation crisis in London.\nThe Oasis\nIt is no fun living in shared accommodation with a money hungry landlord in a small house on a noisy\nstreet. As an overseas post graduate student, I spent\nmy first two and a half months in London seeking\nsuitable accommodation within my means. The\naccommodation office at Imperial College was no help\nat all. The man at the office puffing cigarettes never\nlistened to my problem and always looked at me as\nif I had made a mistake in coming to London. The\naccommodation office at the University of London,\nMalet Street is much better; at least they have a polite\nand helpful attitude. In the search for decent family\naccommodation, I visited almost every possible place\non the list given. Every place was very much in\ndemand and most of these places were not even\nwilling to give me a form to fill in or to put me on the\nwaiting list.\nDesperately I started thinking of leaving Imperial\nCollege and getting myself transferred to Birmingham,\nalthough I know the department is not as strong but\nwhere I could at least find a place to stay. But just\ntv yo days after I wrote to my sponsors asking for\npermission to move to another place, I received a letter from the Bamet Overseas Housing Association\noffering accommodation in Nansen village.\nNansen Village is a beautiful living example for those\nwho want to do something practical. Back in 1967,\na small group of people concerned about the housing\nshortage in London for overseas research students\nthought of building high class accommodation to\nprovide comfort at an affordable price. Today, 8 miles\nfrom Imperial College, Nansen Village is like a small\nUnited Nations, with a very healthy and friendly\natmosphere. The village comprises 60 units far\nmarried students: 33 small self-contained flats for\ncouples without children, 11 flats for families with one\nor two children, and 16 two bedroom houses for\nbigger families. There is also a beautiful open green\narea. One of our colleagues calls it 'children's paradise'. The village has washing facilities, a drier\nand an open drying area and a big communal hall\nwhich is used for a toddlers' play group on weekdays.\nIt can also be used for general, social or private parties\nat weekends and during school holidays, for small\ngroup meetings, disc is sion forums, and cookery\nclasses a room is available with a small kitchenette.\nIn short Nansen Village provides very friendly, quiet\nand comfortable accommodation at an extremely\nreasonable price.\nOne past resident described It as 'undoubtedly the\nbest and the cheapest student accommodation one\ncan find in London.' Dr Daniel from Sudan, currently\ndoing an MSc in Child Health said 'I feel very relaxed\nwhen I am in the hospital as I know my wife and\nchildren are safe and in a nice place.'\nMrs Monica from Uruguay, who is leaving shortly\nsaid, 'I deeply appreciate those who thought of\nbuilding Nansen Village.'\nIt is obvious that someone must have been working\nvery hard to make all this possible. If you come to the\nvillage you can not miss our warden, an energetic, tall\nlady who Is always ready to help, whether you have\nlocked yourself out or stopped the drier by inserting\ncoins from your own country.\nIf yo ij attend one of the social events or parties\nwhich are frequently held in the communal hall, you\nmay meet the wife of the chairman of the association,\na lady with a strong sense of humour. At the end of\nthe party you may see her in the kitchen, helping with\nthe dishes as she is also a member of the very active\nmB nig ment committee,\nIf your oven is out ef order or your sink Blocked or\na bulb has gone, a note in the complaints book will\nbring the 'Jack of all trades' and trouble shooter to\nfix it by the next day.\nThe well dressed gentleman, wearing glasses in his\nsixties is the chairman, an extremely dedicated man.\nA founder member of the association, he has played\na significant role In the building and development of\nNansen Village. As 'captain of the ship', he takes a tremendous interest in the affairs of the village and\neven checks whether the swing in the children's park\nis kept properly oiled r At present he is working on a construction plan to build an additional six family units\nand update the existing ones, Because of the building\nplans, no family accommodation can be offered to\nStudents for the coming academic year.\nAmongst the tremendous accommodation problems\nfor students, there can be solutions provided someone\nis Willing to put in the devotion and hard work\nnecessary. Why are there so few Nansen Villages?\nF. Habiby, Department of Materials\nThe Whole business has got too much for me. All\nthose beeping bar code tills and the clean open\nshelving. Yuck! Bring back Roy Hicks and the nooks\nand crannies I say, and for goodness sake somebody\ntell that Mike Graveson that the closed circuit TV is\nfor watching the dirty videos on, not security...\nNorman Grotbox describes his experience of the new-look Bookshop\nunder its new manager, Mike Graveson.\nThe end of an era\nIf there's one thing I hate it's these high tech types\nwho like everything modern.\nTake this new bloody bookshop for instance. There\nwas a time when you could get all the books you\nwanted and a year's supply of stationery, all for the\nprice of a ballpoint pen. Yes, last year you could\nwander round the nooks and crannies for hours\npretending to search for that elusive copy of 'Persian\nEarthquakes,' whilst stuffing your bag full of free\ngoodies.\nNow that Peacock blok e's ruined it all. You've got\nno excuse to loiter around on the off chance of a good\npassing swipe at the technical pens; no they expect\nyou to pay for everything!\nWhat's more they've made everything easy to find\nand started to stock all manner of stuff. I ask you-I went in to buy a pen and that new manager Mike\nGraveson had sold me 6 HP7 batteries and a bottle\nof Kiwi Fruit Juice before I'd left.\nThe one saving grace of the whole place is the video\nlibrary; even that was a disappointment though. I spent the whole afternoon searching for Gorgeous\nGlenda Get's 'em off and a few other select titles\nconcerning two nuns, a motorbike chain and donkey;\nbut no! Not a spot of smut.\nAs a science-fiction fan (I'm still working on the\ngreasy hair) I was pleased to see a nice new range\nof SF books as well as the top 20 paperbacks. Of\ncourse they still expect you to pay for them. I reckon\nI could read 'Zargon and the Urgs of Tharg' by next\nFriday if I spend enough time in there mind you.\nPage 6\nYes, this new bookshop mafia|lf'\u00a7 ah 6dd type you\nknow; he's from New Zealand. The Union Manager,\nDave Peacock has had to spend two weeks teaching\nhim to speak 'Arthur Daley.' I heard him the other day.\n'No, no, Mike,' he said, 'It's not, \"Yes, we'll have two\ndozen,\" it's, \"Will you do me a discount against two\nhundred back issues of the Nicaragua Times.\" '\nWhy don't you try the new bookshop\nyourself? Stocking products from\nelectrical to confectionery as well as\nbooks, the store is open 9am6 pm Monday to Friday.\nPlus-Video Club!\n\u00a32 per night, \u00a31 membership\n\n"

    "content": "The Hoodoo Gurus'\nMagnum Cum Louder\nSlaves of\nNew York\nThis bizarre film, based in the Big Apple, is enjoyable\nand captivating to watch. It communicates the unique\nNew York feeling, with its layers of civilisation,\ncrumbling buildings and fashionable restaurants, so\nthat you do not just see it you experience it. Rather\nthan telling a story, the film involves you in Eleanor's life: a hat designer with an inferiority complex.\nWe first meet Eleanor involved in an unbalanced\nrelationship with a jealous artist, self-absorbed and\ninsensitive. It is satisfying to watch Eleanor grow in\nself-confidence, until the point where she realises that\nthe problems in the relationship are due to Stash's insecurity, not her own shortcomings.\nThe downtown New York art world is a close knit\ncommunity, where everyone is friend or a friend of\na friend. Although essential to the story none of the\nother characters are particularly memorable in\nthemselves, it is their effect on Eleanor which is\nimportant:\nDaria, the femme fatale, who tries to seduce\nanyone she imagines will further her career as a sculptress.\nMarley Mantello, the egocentric artist with the\nvision of building his 'Chapel of Jesus Christ as a woman' next to the Vatican.\nSherman McVittie, unsuccessful in love, life and\nwork, who pines for his lost love, Daria.\nNot forgetting Andrew, the dal amati an with an\nextremely expressive face.\nSlaves of New York is a highly enjoyable film, which\nis perhaps surprisingly captivating. The production is\nsuperb, aided by some wacky camera work and\ninteresting scene changes. A definite must for all fans\nof the Big Apple.\nBad Taste\nBilled as RCA's finest Rock n' Roll combo the Hoodoo\nGurus come over more as a cross between the out\nof time style lyrics of Lloyd Cole, the humour and\nvocals of Chris Difford of Squeeze and the\ninstrumental back up of a fairly well accomplished pop\nrock group.\nThe outstanding parts of the album are mainly found\nentwined around Brad Shepherd's imaginative and\nlively guitar. Tracks to watch out for are 'Come Any\nTime' and 'Another World' which must be potential\nsingles; 'Shadows of Me' which has a rather innocent\nbeauty and 'Death in the Afternoon.'\nStill Alive\nThis is Circus of Power's second album and it carries\nsix cuts, five of which are \"special live versions\" of\ntracks from the band's debut RCA album. The sixth\ntrack \"Still Alive and Well\" is a previously unreleased\nsong.\nThe members of the band seem to be competent\nmusicians with a complete lack of imagination and as\na result none deserves a mention. As for the \"special\nlive tracks\", live they may be (although I would\nquestion whether the audience were by the end of the\ngig), special they certainly aren't. The band are an American \"trash rock\" group of\nsorts, who in the words of a rock fan I know are\n'nothing special.' The music is rather bare, not yielding\nthe usual full sound of rock.\nSine the LP is rather short I thought I'd give you a brief pre c is of the charms of the tracks.\nStill Alive and Well: Here the band show about as\nmuch musical talent as they do originality. The track\ndemonstrates that their lyrical abilities coincide well\nwith their musical talent as 70% of the lyrics are \"Still\nOther points of interest are the supermarket music\nintro to 'Where's that Hit' and.the rather Red Indian\nTribal sound of 'Hallucinations' which sadly suffers\nfrom a20 second solo that seems to comprise only\ntwo notes (one of the overly self- indulgent side\neffects of a band produced album). Another such side\neffect is the inclusion of the rather tedious 'Glamour\nPuss.'\nAll in all not exactly my type of music, but the band\nshow potential and enthusiasm for their music.\nStar Rating: Well worth a listen.\nCircus of Power\nAlive and Well\". The beat is unimaginative the guitar\nsolo un creative. Motor: The intro is pathetic which means that it\nleads in rather well to the rest of the track. One of\nthe internal guitar solos has a definite resemblance to\na chainsaw without a tree!\nLetters Home: Should have got lost in the post!\nI was going to write about the second side but one\naspect of the album seemed to be rubbing off on me\nas I found everything I was writing was starting to\nrepeat itself.\nThe decision to put out such a half hearted attempt\nat an album backs up the impression one gets listening\nto it that the band are only in it for the money. The\none track of any strength at all is \"White Trash\nQueen\", which actually shows some ingenuity on the\nguitar and probably comes over better live than in the\nstudio. All the same I wouldn't pay \u00a36 for a6 track\nEP with one decent track on it even if I was a follower\nof the band. On top of which, they're ugly B*****d's. Star rating: Definitely not worth buying.\nThere are so many ways to sell a 'horror spoof like\nthis-'Bad taste\u2014it's outrageous, it's anarchic, it's so\nbad it's brilliant...!' you can hear the publicity pundits\ncry. It glories in its amateur status and shoestring\nbudget conveying the desired impression of a bunch\nof wild eccentrics suffering to create their ART.\nAll very noble stuff I'm sure but the finished product\nmust stand on its own and not come cap in hand to\nyour affections as an 'Art' or 'Cult' movie. So if you\ncan shake off the feeling of complicity in a crass\nmarketing ploy-of being conned-then you may find\nthat Bad Taste is a bit of a laugh and here's the joke:\nA 'quiet seaside town' is invaded by aliens who\ncarve up the inhabitants to use as hamburger meat\nfor their inter-galactic fast food chain. The screen is\nthen invaded by the avenging human heroes who\ncarve up the aliens as an outlet for their blood lust and\ntaste for cheap special effects. The plot gives ample\nchance for the squeamish to wriggle in their seats and\nthe macho to disdainfully laugh but the only point, if\nthere is one, seems to be a militant vegetarian\nmessage.\nThe movie industry itself has been conquered by the\nequivalent of fast food chains: selling more and more\ntasteless shit to Pavlovian punters so if there does\nexist a gap in the market can it really be for such bland\nor Bad Taste?\nOpens tonight at Prince Charles, Leicester Square.\nMAC\nPage5\n\n"

    "content": "Bernard Shaw's ORANGE TREE THEATRE Mrs Warren's Profession Mrs Warren's Profession plays 'til\nOctober 7. 01-940 3633 for details.\nThe problem of bringing a Shavian socialist\npro pog and a play to Richmond must be akin to the\nproblem of inviting an unruly friend to a rather delicate\ndinner party. At ninety five years old however (written\nin 1894) this particular old boy is quite easily\nintroduced (by director Brian Cox) as having caused\nquite a disturbance in his youth but as now being a harmless eccentric.\nThe old man's immediate faux pas is the mention\nof prostitutes. To follow comes the disturbing\ncontention that a prostitute is the ultimate example\nand natural result of a person surviving in a capitalist\neconomic system. Kitty Warren is his anecdotal\nexample of this: a woman of vitality scarred but\nhardened by an impoverished childhood, she has\ndragged herself up through the brothels and away\nfrom un rewarded graft. Risen to managing her own\nchain of 'hotels' aided by the seedy Sir George Crofts\nshe passes without question into 'good society' and\nwins her daughter Vivie a brilliant education all the\nway to Cambridge and a Maths tripos.\nUpon return from Cambridge Vivie's unnerving\nfrankness and unexpected maturity sits ill with her\nestranged mother's recollection of her little girl. Vivie's honest rationality soon uncovers the truth about her\nmother's past and the play progressively reveals the\nmotives and machinery that are the real culprits\nbehind the so-called world of vice.\nWell the Shavian wit went down well with the\ndrinks and ne'er so much as a ripple passed through\nthe cosy little four walled club at those awkward\nthroat clearing moments. The audience entertained\nthis toothless old codger politely enough and sadly the\nevening passed without embarrassment.\nMAC\nIndian\nSummer\nWhy did the hippy go east? For the dope of course\nyou idiot, but it might just as easily have been for\nsome of this stuff which has a variety of not so\ndi similar effects. Perhaps that's why, when I went to\nsee the great guru of Kathak dance Durga Lai at the\nLogan Institute, there were no intoxicating drinks for\nsale. (Old Ship Inn opposite provides relief for addicts).\nSupported by his 'disciple' Renu Bassi, making her\nfirst European visit, Durga Lai's performance began\nthe Indian Summer season of dance currently on at\nThe Place.\nSo after a humble introduction of the musicians and\na further introduction to each piece and its cultural\nsignificance we all sat back and got stoned on the\nstuff. The music is the first thing to hit you: the\nmellow vocals, the twitching thump of the tabla and\nthe unmistakably Indian voice of the saran gi the\nnearest thing I 've heard to a living instrument. After\nan indeterminate period of time you can't tell how long\nyou've been there or when you'll have to leave.\nThe stage is there, it would seem, to provide some\nPage 4\nTHE PLACE 'til September 23rd Phone 01-387 0031 for details\nmuch needed orientation and the dance to give you\na focus and prevent spontaneous levitation. The\nhypnotic detail of this form especially in the precision\nof movement of the hands conveys images of\ncomplete control which contrast the heady sweepings\nof the music to give the dance its tension. The playful\nconversation of foot bells and tabla was just one of\nthe displays of virtuosity Durga Lai provided to make\nthe evening a brilliant app et is er for the rest of the\nseason.\nThe artists in this performance, excepting Renu\nBassi, will be playing in 'Ghanashyam'-The Broken\nBranch a music theatre piece devised and composed\nby world famous Ravi Shankar (watch out for details).\nShobana Jeyasingh continues Indian Summer at\nThe Place this Friday and Saturday with her innovative\nand accessible styles and the season concludes with\nPushkala Gopal and Unnikrishnan presenting a new\nprogramme of dance and story dances drawn from\nIndian mythology.\nMAC\nCousins\nThis'film is an Americanised version of the acclaimed\n1976 French film Cousin, Cousine. It is (described as)\na 'romantic comedy' involving two married couples,\nwhen the adult u rous affair of one husband and wife\nis discovered, the other two pretend to be doing\nexactly the same thing in order to get their revenge.\nAs I 've mentioned, the film is described as a romantic comedy although laughs are quite thin on the\nground, one exception being when a teenage son\n(self-styled 'multi-media artist') produces a wedding\nvideo, the result consists of shots of guests gorging\nthemselves inter cut with shots of starving Africans,\nit ends with a shot of a nuclear missile being launched.\nThe cast does not include anybody really well known\nexcept perhaps for Ted Danson (Three Men and a Baby and the TV series Cheers)\nUsually American remakes of French films are not\nas good as the originals and this film does not change\nanything in this respect. Americans can put together\na decent romantic comedy when they want to (for\nexample Hannah and her Sisters) but in the case of\n'Cousins' they have just produced a celluloid 'Mills and\nBoon.'\nIf this film was on TV I would probably turn over\nto watch International Bowls as it would probably be\nmore entertaining.\nMike Morton\nI "

    "content": "Union Bookstore's plans\nsmashed by College\nThe College has held back IC Union's hopes for its new bookstore by\nquadrupling the rent overnight. The move\nhas saddened Union Manager, Dave\nPeacock, who told FELIX 'It pulls away\nfrom other things we are doing.'\nThe rent on the bookstore has risen from\n\u00a34700 per annum to \u00a319,000. Paul Docx,\na representative of 'Impact', who are\nnegotiating the new agreement said that\nthe move ws being made 'To reflect the\nchanging rents around College.' He added\nthat the new rent received a50% subsidy\nfrom the College. As a company wholly\nowned by the College, 'Impact' has\nbecome the College's official rent\nnegotiating body.\nCollege Secretary, John Smith,\ndescribed the process as one 'at arm's length.' The policy of employing 'Impact'\nas a negotiator was passed by the College's Management and Planning Committee.\nSpeaking on the bookstore's recent high\nexpenditure on the refurbishment, Mr Smith said,'I accept that it's a bit rough\non the bookshop.' He added, however,\nthat the new arrangements provided 'much\nsharper objectives,' for the bookstore.\nIf this year goes well for the bookstore,\nMr Peacock expects a profit of \u00a340,000,\nwhich will be halved by the increased rent\ncosts. He described 'Impact's claim of a50% subsidy as 'rubbish.' 'If they offered\nme a rent of \u00a3100,000 and offered to\ndiscount it by 75%, I wouldn't feel any\nbetter, would I? 'he added.\n'Impact' describes the bookshop as a 'non-college based activity,' which Mr Smith backed up by comparing the\nbookstore to a franchise store run by\nDillons. He told FELIX that the site would\nbe a 'commercial rent,' in this case.\nIn response to the notion that the Union\nis a non-college based activity, Mr Peacock said, 'I thought we were part of\nthis College.'\nThe new rent for the bookstore is part\nof the College's policy to increase rents\naround the campus, including that for the\nNational Westminster Bank. The decision\ncomes in the light of a slackening in the\nruling of the University Grants\nCommittee, which forced the College to\nsurrender income from rent to the\nGovernment Treasury.\nWith the increased rents, Mr Peacock\nadded that he couldn't see the Union\nproceeding with the Health Suite\nannounced last year.\nMr Smith told FELLX that he hopes the\nCollege will be able to arrange a stricter\naccountability for academic staff who\nrecommend books which do not sell well\nin the bookstore. He added that the issue\nof compensation for space used by the\nexcess stock accumulated by this problem\nover the years was a separate matter from\nrent negotiations.\nOAP PM sees IC's IRCs\nThe Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher,\nMP, visited College on August 25. In a brief interview with FELIX, she explained\nthat she was visiting the College's Interdisciplinary Research Centres, which\nshe described as 'fundamental and very\nexciting.'\nMrs Thatcher visited two of the\nCollege's three IRCs, which will bring a total of \u00a332 million to the College. 'It's very exciting,' she commented afterwards,\n'what we do both in the basic and the\nprivate research really will have a tremendous effect on the whole future\nsuccess of our country.'\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, told\nFELIX that he had invited Mrs Thatcher\nto view the IRCs after she had expressed\nan interest to Professor Abdus Salaam in\nthe Physics Department. The centres are\nin population biology, Process Simulation\nand control (Chem Eng) and\nSemiconductors.\nMrs Thatcher is known to be unsure\nabout the validity of IRCs as a research\ntool. Professor Ash now believes she\nthinks 'this is the right way to go.'\ntate rd l sci pli nary Research Centres work\nin an inter-departmental manner, drawing\nideas and resources from several areas at\nonce.\nProfessor Stradling puts Maggie in the picture in the\nsemiconductor IRC\nCD Issue 842\nFriday 15th September\n\n"

When he tests it on himself, he fails to notice\nthe transmitter is also occupied by a fly. The two are\ncombined into one and Seth winds up with a good\nhealthy dose of insect DNA.

For\nexample one might comment 'I found that a highly\ncathartic exploration of society's sexual taboos and\nnarc is stic physical it y as it relates to the communal\npsyche.' To which one should correctly reply, 'Well\nI liked the bit where his head fell off.'\nOn offer for the rest of the season are films twined\nunder the headings Medical Nightmare {The Brood and\nThe Entity - till Sat 16th), Possession {Amityville II\nand The Exorcist - Mon 18th Wed 20th) and The\nSlasher {Motel Hell and Funhouse - Thurs 21 st - Sat\n23rd) but don't mistake these nights as a genuine\ndouble bill - you'll have to pay twice.\nFollowing on is a two week season on a similar self\nexplanatory theme The Body - In Extremis promising\nsuch delights as The Desiring Machine and The eating\ndrinking shitting and pissing film.\nIn short here's a well chosen horror season for those\nwho can take the pretentious 'exclusiveness' of the\nplace, but watch out - I'm not sure what the\nmanagement would say if there were too many bums\non seats.\nPage 3\n\n"

Mr Geoff Reaves, Chief Security Officer, told FELIX that he thought it was a 'pretty stupid' thing to put in\na skip. The cause of the fire has not yet been disclosed.\nSAC in hot water\nagain\nDozens of Southside and Linstead Hall residents\nreturned to their rooms on Thursday 31 August, to\ndiscover them flooded. The hot water supply to the\nhalls had been disconnected overnight and during the\nday to 'repair a burst main,' according to Managing\nSurveyor of Residences, Peter Hallworth.\nMr Hallworth told FELLX that everyone in the halls\nhad received a leaflet warning them of the imminent\ndisconnection. Several residents-left their hot water\ntaps running however, which caused the flooding of\n56 rooms.\nSpeaking on the incident, Conference organiser,\nPauline Clark, said, 'No, I still haven't been informed\nofficially that the water was to be switched off She\nadded that the staff at the Summer Accommodation\nCentre's reception desk had not been informed either.\nShe described the leafleting of the halls as 'minimal.'\nThe College has not lost business as a result of the\nflooding and has received only one claim for damages\nto guests' belongings.\nMs Clark explained that out of the 56 rooms\nflooded, only 10 occupants insisted on moving. \"They\nthought it was a rather a hoot!' she added. She\nsummarised by describing the affair as 'just crossed\nwires.\nCollege Accommodation Officer, Loretto\nO 'Callaghan, told FELLX that leaflets were produced\nand distributed 'to the best of her knowledge.' She\nadded that there weren't as many moves as they had\nthought and said 'it all worked very well in the end.'\nEmergency spaces were cleared in Beit Hall to\nac coir ur iodate the overflow and rooms were arranged\nin hotels as part of a contingency plan. Although the\ncontingency plans were not required, Ms O 'Callaghan\ntold FELLX that the students who worked on the night\nwere 'magnificent.'\nNew code of conduct for\nSubwardens\nFisher Hall lost and Montpelier Hall gained a new\nsub-warden last week, when Warden Dr Kevin\nO 'Connor appointed Fisher Hall sub-warden, Ndiba\nDoih. The decision has caused College Secretary,\nJohn Smith to suggest the formation of a code of\nconduct for the appointment of sub-wardens.\nMr Doih became a sub-warden of Fisher Hall last\nyear after living in Montpelier Hall. Dr O 'Connor\ntold FELIX that he had supplied Mr Doih with a reference for his original sub-warden application and\nhad been present on the committee which advised his\nappointment. He described Mr Doih as\u00bbthe best\ncandidate from the twenty or so who applied for the\nposition of sub warden of Montpelier Hall.\nMr Smith described the appointment as 'very\nwasteful,' and added that the whole affair had caused\na lot of ill feeling and inconvenience. He now wants\nto see a code of practice established to cover such\naffairs. He told FELIX that the appointment could\nhave been covered by a transfer of sub-warden from\nFisher Hall and interviewing for a new sub-warden\nfor Fisher Hall.\nDr O 'Connor told FELIX that he 'certainly did not\nmean to cause any trouble,' and added that he did\nnot believe that he had. The 'head-hunting' of sub-wardens had a precedent last year, when a sub-warden\nmoved from Mining House to Garden Hall.\nDr Richard Murphy, Warden of Fisher Hall told\nFELLX that the idea of a code of conduct 'might make\nsome aspects easier.' He added that he 'may have\nfound someone,' for the vacant post of sub-warden\nat Fisher Hall.\nImperial wins at UFC\nImperial has succeeded in gaining a nationwide top\nresearch ranking in all of the departments reviewed\nby the Univeris.ty Funding Council recently. The new\nratings place IC 3rd in the national table of Univerities\nwith 91.25% of the possible marks.\nRector, Professor Eric Ash told FELLX, 'We've\ndone extraordinarily well.' The UFC now aim to give\na double weighting to research excellence, which\nProfessor Ash expects to provide a 'sizeable fraction\nof a million (pounds),' in future years. 'It won't drastically change our fortunes overnight,' he added.\nThe departments reviewed included Biology,\nMineral Resources Engineering, Materials and\nElectrical Engineering, which all received 'star\nratings' in the new rankings.\nCollege buys back Earls\nCourt death trap\nThe College Accommodation Office has recently\nrenegotiated the head tenancy agreement on 8 Earls\nCourt Square. The site was returned to the landlord\nin 1987 due to the building breaking a number of\nCouncil s aft y regulations.\nThe property has since been modernised to a very\nhigh standard and houses 32 people in flats, single,\ndouble and triple rooms. The accommodation is\navailable to all students and staff of IC and St Marys\nfrom next term on 51 week lets. Rents are \u00a359/single,\n\u00a349/bed in a double and \u00a339 in a triple all exclusive\nof bills and poll tax following April 1990.

    "content": "FeliX The past month has been a busy time in the FELIX\noffice. A lot of print work has passed through the\npress and I 've had a lot less time to get things set up\nthan I would have liked. This is fine because people\nhave been flexible and accommodating and I have\nresponded by trying to get work done as quickly and\nefficiently as possible. Whafis begining to piss me off\nis the growing certainty that a huge number of people\nare going to come into FELIX on the first Monday of\nterm to ask me to produce a poster for them. I am\nsorry to have to announce that anybody who does not\ninform me of their requirements for Freshers' week\nby 5.30pm Monday 18th September, will be cordially\ninformed that the photocopier has developed a terminal disease. I'm sorry, but Freshers' week and\nthe weeks preceding and following it are very busy\nand I have to know what I have to do in advance in\norder to organise printing and general production. I will\nbe delighted to help anyone who still wants work\nbooked in today or Monday.\nOn the subject of Freshers' week, I was amazed to\nhear of clubs asking the Union if it was too early to\nbook a stall at Freshers' Fair this year. If a club is so\ndisorganised that its members are not even capable\nof reading and replying to a letter, I would suggest that\nthe organisation of club matters is probably on a similar level. The relevant clubs will be the ones which\ndo not appear in this year's Freshers' Fair guide in\nFELIX.\nThe last issue of FELIX carried an article following\nthe antics of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'\nI have received queries as to the source of the\ncowboys; it has been suggested that they may have\nbeen contractors. Whether this is true or not, the\nlatest episode in the FELIX repairs saga is even more\nridiculous. The FELIX was flooded last term when the\ntoilets above leaked. The deluge soaked the ceiling\ntiles in the office, and these were replaced.\nApproximately 16 tiles were replaced in an admirably\nspeedy manner. The poor match with the existing tiles\nwas later corrected by swapping tiles in the print area\nwith those in the office. All of this passed without a hitch. The shock came when the Union was informed\nof the cost of this small job-\u00a3800! Yes, there are two\nzeros; it is not a misprint.\nQuite frankly, I cannot see where this figure comes\nfrom. The labour charge is obviously a large part of\nthe cost, but I would expect Royal architectural\napproval for this sort of figure. Come on Peter\nHallworth and those on high in estates-where's the\nreal invoice?-! dare you! By the way, I 'll do it myself\nnext time, if you're prepared to pay that much.\nHaving heard several conflicting eye-witness\naccounts of the flooding in Southside hall, I am at a loss as to what the truth of the matter is. The news\nstory carries what I perceive to be the truth with\neverybody's story thrown in. Somebody, somewhere\nis lying. Mr Hallworth assures FELIX that everybody\nin Southside and Linstead received a leaflet informing\nthem of the impending shutdown of the hot water\nsupply. Pauline Clark at SAC claims that the leafleting\nwas minimal. Loretto O 'Callaghan at the\nAccommodation Office said that the leaflets were\ndistributed 'to the best of her knowledge.' As the\nAccommodation Officer, who is in overall control of\nSouthside and Linstead, her knowledge should be the\ndefinitive word on the matter. The worrying point is\nthat I don't think it is. If she doesn't know the full facts\nabout as serious an affair as this, how much does she\nknow about the College's accommodation\narrangements as a whole and what is she being paid\nto do?\nOn the matter of the Union Bookshop's rent, I am\nstill undecided as to who is in the right. The College\nhas appointed Impact to negotiate rent for space on\ncampus in an attempt to remain 'at arm's length,'\naccording to College Secretary John Smith. The idea\nis a sound one, since it stops people doing 'favours'\nfor each other at the College's expense. Having said\nthat, I still feel that Impact is being used as the\nCollege's 'Hitman' to deal with its dirty laundry. This\nway they can always stand back and say, 'talk to\nImpact.' The fact of the matter is that Impact is a company which is wholly owned by the College.\nThat's enough airing of dirty laundry anyway. The\ngood news is that FELIX has a new printer called\nAndrew Thompson. We are all glad to 'have him\naboard,' as everybody who has met him has said of\nmy dirty laundry. I'm looking forward to working with\nhim this year\u2014be's a good find in my opinion.\nThanks to everybody who has helped on this issue,\nthey should be listed somewhere on this page. You're\nall dedicated n utters and fantastic with it.\nDave\nDelaying\ntactics\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to you concerning the Benefits and Rights\nCampaign I am presently organising for the beginning\nof next term. The aim of the campaign is to give\nstudents help and advice on all aspects of\naccommodation from tenants rights to Housing\nBenefit as well as legal advice and information on\nDHSS Benefits.\nI wrote to representatives of various relevant\norganisations inviting them to attend, including the\nCollege Accommodation Officer Loretto O 'Callaghan.\nThis was an opportunity for her to deal with students'\naccommodation problems before they became\nimminent. I felt that she would be more than willing\nto attend. I was therefore surprised to receive a letter\nfrom Loretto refusing the invitation. Apparently six\nweeks was not enough notice for her to be able to\narrange to send any representative from the\nAccommodation Office, even though it was only for\n3Vi hours.\nSurely there is something wrong if the\naccommodation office is so overworked and/or\nunderstaffed that 3 54 man hours cannot be found 6\nweeks in advance.\nYours Jackie Scott\nICU Welfare Officer 89-90\nMary's foots the\nbill\nDear Editor,\nIn the issue of FELIX for 18th August the heading\n'Mary's refit costs College,' above a photograph on\nthe back page suggested that the costs of\nimprovements to the students' bar and restaurant\nbeing undertaken this summer were being met from\nImperial College funds. This is not so. All \"costs are\nbeing met from School funds supplemented by an\nagreed contribution from the St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School Students' Union. As some of your\nreaders will be aware the Medical School is funded\nseparately from 'Imperial College' for a period of up\nto five years from the date of the merger (1 August\n1988) under a Memorandum of Agreement made\nbetween the Governing Body and the School Council.\nYours faithfully\nBrian Lloyd-Davies\nSecretary to the Dejegacy.\nCredits\nMany thanks to Sydney Harbour-Bridge for record\nreviews and help on news and production;Liz Warren\nfor editing features and helping all round; Stef Smith\nbeing a hero in my hours of need; Mike Morton and\nMac for reviews; Fiona for the V&A feature; Mr\nHabiby for the Oasis feature; Andrew Thompson for\nbeing a brilliant printer and flexible to boot; Mac again\nfor staying up late on Wednesday night and the\nanonymous sources who shall remain forever so.\nCopyright\nFELIX is published by the editor for and on behalf of\nImperial College Union Publications Board and is\nprinted by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince\nConsort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel. 01-589 5111\next 3515).
