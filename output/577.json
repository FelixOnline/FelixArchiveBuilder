    "content": "Dear Steve\nIn your editorial last week you\noffered the view that with education of the general public\non matters nuclear (presumably\nalong the lines of 'Protest and\nSurvive'), a nuclear war need not\nhave the horrific consequences\ndepicted in 'The War Game'.\nOn this matter, the Minister of\nState for Home Affairs estimated\n( March16,1980) that following\nthe measures set out in 'Protest\nand Survive' might reduce the\ndeath toll (in \"the sort of nuclear\nattack which we think we can\nexpect\") from 40m to 25m. In addition to this, shortages of\nuncontaminated food and water;\ndestruction of energy supplies\nand sanitation; migration of\ndesperate refugees; would result\nin violence, disease epidemics,\nand perhaps starvation \u2014 more\ndeaths and mass misery.\nThus, whilst education on civil\ndefence is of vital importance, it\nis a dangerous deception to\nbelieve that it could ensure, anything but a shattered and\nbrutal existence for those remain-ing.\nTragically, the government's present utterances on the subject\nattempt to hush people into a resigned acceptance of nuclear\nwar, and their' civil defence'\npreparations have more to do\nwith maintaining martial law,\nthan saving lives.\nAs ever, the only insurance\nagainst the effects of nuclear war\nis never to have such a war.\nYours sincerely\nJonathan Lawrence\nPhysics 3\nDear Sir\nOn Thursday, February 12, I attended the Mop soc lecture given by Dr Magnus Pyke on the\n\"Understandability of Science\"\nApproximately twenty minutes\ninto the talk I noticed that the\nperson in front of me appeared to\nbe writing a report on what Dr Pyke was saying. Being naturally\ncurious I read some of it and\nconcluded that it was factually\naccurate but very badly structured. On Friday I read the FELIX lead article which was exactly the\nsame report I had seen being\nwritten during the talk. I will\nrepeat that lor emphasis written\nDURING the talk. This is\nextremely bad practice and a reading of the article reveals it to\nbe an appalling piece of reporting\ncharacterized by adjacent sentences which have absolutely no\nrelation to each other. The piece\ndid not appear to have been\nrevised or rewritten and it seer m questionable if it had ever been\nreread by the incompetent reporter who wrote, nay hacked,\nthis piece of illiterate drivel.\nIf your newspaper can do no\nbetter than publish such verbal\ngarbage as the main article of the\nweek then I humbly suggest that\nit gives up all such reporting and\nconfine itself to the puerile gossip\ncolumns more suited to your reporter's prose style.\nTours sincerely\nCM Jeffcock (Mr)\nDear Sir\nIncluded in FELIX577 was a letter written by myself and three\nothers, which you credited to\nRuth Hildebrand only. Perhaps\none has to be a' Union person-ali ty' to have a letter published in\nFELIX, or would the inclusion of\ntwo other names have ruined the\neffect of your snide editorial note?\n(Signatures unreadable - Ed.)\nDear Sir\nI am writing against the Royal School of Mines being allowed to\nput on their \"adult entertain-ment\" on Imperial College ground. Both women and men\nattend this College and both should be allowed the same rights\nand status. Presenting women as\nmere sex objects is degrading and\ninsulting to the women at this\nCollege who certainly do not\nattend it in this role. Mines pointed out last year that a male\nstripper was included in the\nevent, which could thus not be\nviewed as sexist. However, from a WIST survey previous the event\nlast year, we found out that the\naudience was very pre dom in at ly male and the male stripper was\nconsidered as a\" bit of a joke\".\nWe are well aware that the\nmen to women ratio is rather\nlarge but would like to suggest\nthat this problem will not diminish if IC continues to offer\nservices which undermine the\nimage of women. Men who cannot cope with the problem on\na personal basis should go and\nget rid of their frustration elsewhere. After all London is full\nof opportunities. However, a warning against this kind of\nopportunity: it is debasing for\nmen to have to actually pay to\nsee a woman naked.\nIf anyone feels strongly enough\nto protest against this event, they\nare welcome to come and join the\npicket on February 27 at 7:00pm. Other people are invited to think\nof the implications of this \"adult\nentertainment\" and to try and\nsee further than being \"one of the\nlads\". Of course, I would be very\ninterested in the reply of anyone\nwho can justify the event on\nother than selfish grounds.\nWIST Dear Sir\nIf it only costs \u00a310 for ICU to\naffiliate to C ND( FELIX576) then why can't we have a collection around College (which\nwould without doubt raise the\namount very quickly). This would surely be a simple solution\nto the ' Ultra Vires' problem since\nthen the money would be coming\nout of ' personal' rather than 'trust' funds and this would be\nallowable as far as I can see from\nyour account of the 1972 court\ncase. Is it really that simple or\nhave I misunderstood some vital\npoint?\nI can't help thinking that the\nmore militaristic and conservative members of our Union are\nonly too pleased to see such\ncomplications blocking the realization of what was after all aUG M decision to affiliate to\nC ND. Yours sincerely\nMark Brown\nLS2 Sir\nTLand Union Democracy Lovers Unite! Never let it be said\nthat a reasonable idea wasn't tried.\nAnyone interested in last\nminute distribution before the\nHustings U GM on March5, or\ntaking a few posters to their home/ flat/ bedroom wall can\ncontact me early next week and\nthe extra posters or leaflets will\n(semi) miraculously appear.\nOf course, everyone at the\nU GM will be amazed and astounded at the sabbatical candidates' wit and repartee\n(nudge, wink).\nDave Wheatley\nc/oI C Union Office\nDear Sir\nI should like to take this opportunity to put straight a few\nerroneous details contained in\nthe article written by I CM C News Agency in last week's FELIX. In particular, I should\nlike to point out to the Mountaineering Club that since it was\nthey who followed us into the\npetrol station, then this would\nindicate that it was S&G who\nfirst had the idea to visit Wales,\nand Mountaineering Club, short\nof ideas, and reading FELIX the\nweek before, seized on the idea\nthemselves, and followed us to\nWales.\nContinuing to correct further\ndetails of the article, it should be\npointed out that the \" puny jalopy\" was in fact G GP,a Union minibus( Annie take note), and that it had been fitted\nwith a new engine, and was thus\nbeing run in. Indeed, Annie had\ngiven explicit instructions not to\nexceed 60mph, and the ta cho graph fitted proves this to be the\ncase.\nAfter what can only be desc ribe d as a piece of reckless\ndriving in order to prove some\npoint in overtaking whilst other\nvehicles were approaching from\nthe opposite direction, Mountaineering Club did not pull away, nor did S&G give chase at\nall, but rather merely continued\nat a sedate pace, keeping up with\nMountaineers with perfect ease\nand control. We were, however,\nsurprised at their route, choosing\nthe A5 instead of M6.We chose\nthe latter, and arrived back at\nthe Union at 12:30am. Mountaineers, what were you doing?\nAs to the allegation of following them, what went wrong this\nweekend, or didn't you know we\nwent to Mendips?\nS&G Press Officer\nSir\nThe Government is at present\nbulldozing through Parliament a bill to reform Nationality Law. It seems that the indecent haste is\nto take the minds of the faithful\noff the economic position by an\nappeal to primitive racism.\nC it zen ship of the UK or\nColonies was recognised under\nthe 1948 Nationality Act as\nconferring considerable rights on\npeoples exploited by Imperial\nBritain with regard to future\nrelationships within the new\nCommonwealth. However the\nincreasing con cio us ness of black\nimmigrants in this country of\ncivil rights and cultural needs\nbeing openly or tacitly denied,\nallied with a misguided and misunderstood racism on the side\nof many whites, has led to the\nimmigration acts and increasing\nh arras s ment of blacks who are\nlegally present in the UK \u2014\nwhich is now being cynically\nlegitimized in a bill which amounts to a policy of induced\nrepatriation of black people \u2014\nmany of whom have served their\nnew adopted ;community more\nthan adequately.\nIt is proposed to introduce\nthree classes of citizenship \u2014\nonly one of which gives real\nrights to residence and services in\nPage 2 FEUX, February 20,1981\n\n"

The initial\nproblem was the disappearance of several items\nof luggage from the basement of Linstead Hall.\nFollowing discussions with Mr Reeves, the Chief\nSecurity Officer, a receipt system has been\nbrought into operation. The messenger in\nLinstead Hall has been issued with a triplicate\nreceipt book; one receipt is attached to the item\nof luggage, one is given to the student and one\nremains with the messenger. The luggage will not\nbe released until the receipt is presented to the\nmessenger. This system will hopefully tighten up\nthe security of the area and try to prevent luggage\nbeing stolen as the Insurance Policy now states\nthat theft cover applies only where there is\nevidence of force able and violent entry.\nI cannot stress how important it is for you to\ntake care that your rooms are locked and that\nany valuables are locked away or are separately\ninsured. Students can individually extend the\npolicy to include accidental breakage or loss to\nspecified items such as cameras, stereo\nequipment, jewellery, etc., on application to\nEndsleigh and payment of an additional premium.\nIf anyone would like any advice on this matter\nplease don't hesitate to get in touch with me.\nINCOST\nPreparations for the conference are advancing\nvery well.

The publicity\norganised for the meeting was of the same\nquantity as had been produced for the previous\nmeetings; 2,000 copies of Exec News which were\ndistributed from Monday to Thursday. Further\nissues were distributed around the Refectories,\nthe Union Lower Lounge, and the J CR at about\n11:30am on the Thursday morning.\nPWP have kindly taken over my suggestion of a working party to produce ways of encouraging\nattendance, but I am only sorry that Owen Green\nand William Cortazzi (Bill the Mole?) felt they\ncould not offer any helpful ideas on this issue. I thought Tim Lawes' suggestions very constructive and I hope to have a chat with him about\nthem. Anyone else who thinks they can help more\nthan welcome to attend the P WP meeting on\nFriday, February 20 at 12:40pm in the Union\nOffice or come and see me.\nI entirely agree with Steve in his remarks about\nthe subject matter submitted this year to UG Ms. If you feel that the subjects which have been\nsubmitted do not appeal to you then please\nformulate a motion which is interesting to you and\nhopefully to other students as well. The motion\ndeadline for the next UGM is Thursday,\nFebruary 26, 1981.\nColours\nThe deadline for nominations for Social Colours\nwill be the last day of this term, Friday, March 20.\nNominations and their justifications should be\nhanded to me in the Union Office.\nSorry this is so lengthy but do think about\nsubmitting a motion and remember the next\nU GM is on Thursday, March 5 at 1:00pm in the\nGreat Hall.\nHope to see you there.\nWelfare\nMatters Raised\nHaldane Library\nThe Haldane Library Committee have formed a working party, of which I am a member, to\nconsider the relationship of the Haldane to the\nLyon Piayfair Library and to discuss library\nfacilities for the Humanities ODtions.\nAt its first meeting last week the following\npoints were discussed:\n1. Whether course textbooks for undergraduate humanities options should be in the\nHaldane or the Lyon Piayfair Library, and what\nthe borrowing arrangements should be (e.g. restricted loan for books used specifically for\nessays, which will be needed by many students\nover a short period).\n2. The possibility of merging the two libraries\nwith one main entrance and one issue desk,\nallowing free access to the Haldane collection\nthrough the Lyon Piayfair Library.\nWe need student opinion on this (especially\nthat of people taking Humanities options) so can\nanyone interested please either come and see me\nor drop a note into the Union Office by Monday,\nMarch 9.\nLondon Student Travel\nLST is looking for Representatives, especially\nfrom Halls and House, to distribute a few leaflets,\nposters, etc., for which you will get a \u00a35.00\nvoucher off your holiday. Anyone interested\nplease come and see me as soon as possible.\nLST are also holding a Trade Fair on Tuesday,\nMarch 3, in the JCR. There will be about twenty-five travel operators coming so if you're intending'\nto travel this Easter or Summer make a note in\nyour diary, and look out for more details.\nRape Alarms\nI have now found a supplier who can sell me the\nhand-held repel l alarms (which I 've previously\nwritten about) for only \u00a32.50, so if anyone wants\none at this new low price can they come and see\nme as soon as possible so I can judge whe the i there's enough demand to make a bulk order, i Cheap Tube Fares?\nJohn and 1 recently went to a meeting at City\nUniversity to get all the Universities, Colleges and\nPolytechnics in London together to try and\npersuade London Transport to give concessionary rates on tubes and buses for students. Soon\nthere should be a campaign starting and a petition\ngoing around, so when it does I hope you'll all sign\nit, as I'm sure you're all in favour of cheaper fares.\nQUOORRUMM!\nThe post of Union General Meeting Chairperson\nfor the 1981/2 session is to be elected soon. The\npapers go up on February 26, come down on\nMarch 9 with the hustings at the U GM on March\n12. Have you the nerve to hold back 300 (you'll be\nlucky) screaming heathens and the ability to run a meeting to its standing orders? In that case you're\nhalf way there. If you'd like to stand and have any\nquestions, see Liz Lindsay, Hon Sec or Jon Firth,\nMech Eng 3.\nSince it seems that some landlords are still fixing\nelectricity meters above the legal resale limit of\n4.77p per unit perhaps more posit ve action is\nneeded. If you are concerned about your meter\nthe London Electricity Consultative Council would like to know about it, the number to ring is\n638 4803. They will tell you how to check that you\nare in fact paying too much and, if need be, advise\nyou to initiate legal proceedings. However, a friendly word of warning to the landlord of your\nintentions may well cause him to think again.\nMeanwhile, in desperation at the high cost of\nelectric ty, some people are turning to a cheaper\nform of heating \u2014 para fin stoves. I am told by\nBob Foggan, our fire chief, that they cannot be\nused in any College accommodation since para fin stoves and students are a highly combustible\ncombination! However, if you like outside College\nand decide to use this form of heating make sure\nyou have a heater stamped with BS (British\nStandard) 3300. This ensures that anyone given\nto staggering or fumbling around in the dark can\nknock it over without setting themselves or\nanyone else alight (the end result of 15 specific\nlaboratory tests which ha v eto be passed before\nthe kite mark of the BS Institution is awarded). It\nis now illegal to sell a paraffin heater without the\nBS label and consequently many insurance\ncompanies will not pay up for fire damage if a heater other than aBS one caused the fire. It\ndoesn't end there either. Bob tells me that the\nstoves should be taken outside for refilling, and\neven the paraffin used should comply with the BS\ncode\nAnother type of risk that we get queries about\nare TV licences. Unfortunately when the Post\nOffice goes on the prowl it seems to operate on\nthe principle first seen, first served. In other\nwords, the unsuspecting Flatsharer who opens\nthe door may well end up receiving the summons,\neven if there are ten other people watching the\nbox and the blok e who bought it left the country\ntwo years ago. And you can't always rely on the\nfolks back home since their licence only covers\nyou if the TV is purely portable, that is, without\nany sockets for mains connection.\nFinally, just a reminder about the new dental\nregulations, due to commence at the end of\nMarch. If you're 19 or 20 you will no longer get\nfree treatment under the NHS. However, all is not\nlost for anyone over 18 paying a fairly high rent\nsince this will normally bring you into the category\nable to claim a refund during term time as well as\nthe holidays. For further information about this\nask your dentist or come and consult our leaflets.\nIf you need a NHS dentist in the area we have a list of some, while those students who live in IC\nHalls as well as the UL Intercollegiate Halls can\nuse the UL U Dental Service at Malet Street,\nphone number 636 9799.\nSue Telling\nStudent Services\n15 Princes Gardens\nBookshop News\nALL DIARIES have been reduced by at least a third. You still have ten months to go!\nInternational Writers Day\nMarch 14 at the Purcell Rooms. Organized by\nP.E.N., The World Association of Writers.

Next, they tilted the can until the level\nof beer came to halfway down the inside of the\ntilted can. All the beer which was poured out of\nthe can during the operation was caught in a glass and given to the first student.\nThe can was then tilted until the beer level\njust reached the bottom of the tilted can; again\nthe beer poured out was caught in a glass, and\nthis was handed to the second student.\nThen they tilted the can again, this time until\nthe level came to halfway down the circular\nbottom of the can. This measured the third\nstudent's share, and of course the last student\ndrank what was left in the can.\nIt doesn't take very long for an engineer to\ndrink that much beer, so they had plenty of\ntime and sufficient sobriety to consider\nwhether the beer had been divided fairly, and if\nnot, what proportion each had received.

Whilst some may consider\nthis a devastating faux pas, others\nprefer this organic form of nonverbal communication to ordinary\nconversation; in fact, the Rector\nhas made a career out of it.\nThere are of course many different types of fart. The Morse Fart\nrequires strict sphincter control\nand years of practise amongst\ndevotees, and should not be\nconfused peeps and squeaks of an\nill-concealed fart emanating from\nthe tightly clasped cheeks of an\namateur.\nThe SBD (Silent But Deadly) is the\ninevitable conclusion to lingering\nafterburn from a previous Moonie\nbeef risotto. Powerful enough to\nparalyse a skunk at fifty paces, it\nranks with bestiality, flagellation,\nand IC Ents as the lowest form of\nhuman existence. An ill wind may\nblow good however; whilst waiting\nendlessly for photocopy ing machines in the Lyon Play i air Library, dropping one's guts will not only\nshorten the waiting list but might\nalso clear a path to the delectable\nJanice at the check-out counter.\nOne word ol warning though \u2014 to\navoid suspicion always be the first\nto sniff the air briefly and then\nex la im loudly \"Strewth, someone's really dropped a brick!\".\nThe Postern Blast is the piece de\nresistance of farting, and is\ncommonly caused by drinking\nStan's Sam Smiths without sterilis-ing it in Detol beforehand. II\nperformed correctly it will bring\nrapturous applause from cog-nes centi and a writ from the Noise\nAbatement Society. Refrain from\ncarrying out this manoeuvre in\nconfined spaces, for although the\nPostern Blast is totally devoid of\nodour, it can perforate the eardrum\nof the unsuspecting. It is also\nadvisable to wear reinforcements\non the backs of trousers, and\nnearby windows should be taped\nover or covered with a net curtain.\nNonetheless the Postern Blast can\nbe a favourite party trick, such as\nblowing out birthday cake candles,\nor igniting the wind and making a sheet of flame scorch out across the\nwallpaper.\nOne of the more distressing farts\nis the Wet One (also known as\n'dropping coconuts'). Often caused\nby pre-exam stress, or the anticipation of a nurses disco, the Wet One\nis difficult to prevent, but the more\nem baras sing side effects can be\nminimise d by wearing absorbent\nunderwear. Persistent farting of\nthis nature may need medical\nattention, or a good sized cork\nbung.\nSo there we have it \u2014 love it or\nleave it, the fart is no passing phase,\nand should be appreciated in all its\nglory. But until the social stigma of\nletting rip is overcome, the fart will\nremain the breezy secret of\nhundreds of devotees.\nLive in Starts Bar: Jamie Lynne Paradise\nand\nJimmie Rhythms\n( ex Leo Savers Band)\nThis Wednesday at8.30 FREE!

But Tuesday last week, for a brief\nperiod, the message \"Monro'san urd\" was seen glaring out across the\ngardens (captured by our photographer above).\nIt was first thought that the snide slogan may have referred to a Linstead resident but it was later revealed that the reason it was removed\nso quickly was because it referred to Dr Don Munro, Senior Warden and\nChairman of i he Residence Committee.\nMost of the Linstead residents have refused to speak to FELIX and\neven when faced with the photographic evidence refuse to comment.\nHowever, one Linstead resident told us that the Sub-warden had advised\nthem to take down the letters before DrM on ro or Dr Carabine (Linstead\nWarden) saw them.\nTHE RECTOR, Lord Flowers, reaffirmed the fundamental\naims of Imperial College in his address to open International\nWeek last Monday.\nImperial College was founded to give a high level of scientific\ntraining to students from all over the world. For that reason it had governors representing different countries, e.g. Australia and Canada. The College was originally intended to serve students from Europe,\nthen the Commonwealth, and now the whole world, and there have\nbeen overseas students here since its formation.\nThis year there are 771 overseas students, which is a20% reduction\non the last session. These students now comprise only 17% of the\nstudent body. In1978/9 this percentage was 23%. This represents a dramatic change, and distorts the purpose and character of the\nCollege.\nThere are presently students from eighty-five countries, speaking\nseventy-five different languages. This mix of nationalities is invaluable\nfor academic advancement. It provides an incentive for solving\nproblems all over the world. It cultivates understanding and tolerance,\nand leads indirectly towards world peace.\nSome advanced courses are run specifically for overseas students,\nand more would be if needs could be identified. In the past, academic\nstaff have been encouraged to do what interests them. In future needs\nmust be satisfied first.\nTurning to finance, the Rector said that the Government expects\n\u00a35,000 per overseas students to be paid. IC lost in the last year or so a quarter of its overseas students, and may continue to lose more. He regretted the imposition of high fees, but had to recognise the\nGovernment's policies of cutting public spending. He added \" to us\nthe imposition of high fees to reduce the cost to the taxpayer is\nadministratively clumsy, educationally harmful, and diplomatically\ndisastrous\".\nIn London there is a high proportion of overseas students and the\nconsequences of higher fees were appalling, especially in medicine. \" I cannot believe that such insensitive foolishness can continue for long. I believe the Government will see the error of its ways\".\n\"....achievement and promise \"\nThe College admits students on the basis of achievement and promise, without regard to the student's beliefs. The College does not\nnecessarily accept the beliefs or actions of its home and overseas\nstudents. They are less concerned with the beliefs of a student's parents,\nsponser s or government. The right to come here must be supported, no\nmatter how strong our own belief. \" This basic principle must be\nupheld\". The College, as an institution, is not empowered to take sides,\nand will achieve nothing if it does. By upholding the right of the\nindividual, and the rule of reason, we can help men and women to see\nthe folly of conflict and oppression.\nIn answer to questions, Lord Flowers doubted whether overseas\nstudents would go back to being charged the same as home students.\nHalf the purpose of a university, especially Imperial College, is\nresearch, and the Government's policies were rd uci ng the number of\noverseas students on these courses. He hoped however that IC would be\nwell positioned to take advantage of any upturn in the economy by\nhaving more research sponsored by industry.\nNo. 577 Friday, February 20,1981 Free!\n\n"

On Tuesday, Physics\nLecture Theatre 1 was crowded\nbeyond lire regulations which\nwould have resulted in some\nembarrassed faces should the\nfour minute warning have sounded.

Altogether ten teams\nentered the competition, and the\nwinners will receive a trophy for\ntheir efforts. There were some\nhair-raising incidents during the\nracing, however. In one heat, a group of school children walked\nacross the track, and in another a lorry with a skip dumped its loa p in the middle of the course.

    "content": "Reviews\nCertificate X. Starring Robert De Niro,\nJoe Pesci. Directed by Martin Scorsese.\nNow showing at Notting Hill Gate, Classic\nChelsea and Studio Oxford St.\nA crashing hand sends Marcel Cer dan reeling and the fight is stopped. It is 1949 and\nJake la Motta, the Bronx Bull, has won the title\nMiddleweight Champion of the World.\nRaging Bull is based on the bravely honest\nautobiography of La Motta, a tough ItalianAmerican who quickly falls from being World\nChampion to failed night club owner.\nThe film is not just about boxing; scenes\nfrom various fights punctuate a look at one\nman's personal life; his violent temper and\nsuspicion outside the ring help him to win\nfights, yet ruin his relationships with his\nbrother Joey and wife Vickie. He refuses to\ndeal with the fight racketeers and is thus\nprevented from contending the title for many\nyears.\nThe boxing scenes are short and to the\npoint. Fists cause deep thuds and the boxers\nsweat, blow and bleed their way to glory. Slow\nmotion enhances the moment of victory, as La Motta revels in his trade. He retires and buys a night club in which he gives a self-humiliating\ncomedy act.\nIn the lead role Robert De Niro gives a marvellous performance \u2014 he firstly trained as\na boxer and then gained an amazing sixty\npounds in weight to show La Motta's later\nyears. He is ably supported by Joe Pesci as his\nmanager and brother, Joey.\nThe underlying theme of human tragedy is\nat times 'quite unbelievable. After all, who in\ntheir right minds could blow all their money\nand ruin a marriage to a beautiful wife as Jake\ndid? It is, however, true and we see a blend of\nhuman emotion and violent action which make\nthe film entertaining, up to a point.\nThus I reach the controversy surrounding\nthe film. As you no doubt know, there was a danger at first that it would not be shown in\nthis country when the two dominant cinema\nchains refused to show it. Their reason? That it\nwas firstly too violent and secondly full of bad\nlanguage. Whilst both of these elements are\nevident in the film, it is not just a ruthless\nexploitation movie. It would not appeal to the\nprudish or squeamish, but it is a tragedy to\nthink that the people running the vast majority\nof our cinemas do not believe that there is a sufficiently adult audience, who can discriminate between good and bad films, for them to\nmake a reasonable profit. It is an intelligently\nmade and artistically important film, which\nshould be seen by those interested in such\npowerful real life dramas.\nMark Smith\nERRATUM\nOn the front page of this issue we incorrectly\nrefer to the Rector as LORD Flowers of\nQueensgate, this should, of course, have read\nBARON Flowers of Queensgate.\nAlso, in the Editorial on the back page the\nEditor refers to the Rector as \"sensitive\", this\nshould have read \"sensible\".\nRobert De Niro has not surprisingly been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Jake La\nMotta. He achieved the startling transformation from boxer (left) to overweight slob (right) in only\ntwo months.\n\"Battle Beyond The Stars\"\nBattle Beyond The Stars (A, Warner West End, ABC Fulham Rd) is a harmless sci-fi romp from\nthe Roger Corman stable. Evil warlord Sador (John Saxon) arrives at the planet Akir with an\nultimatum - submit to my rule or I 'll turn your planet into a star with my \"stellar converter\"\n(Yipee!).\nNot surprisingly the pacifist residents of Akir take offence and send Shad (Richard Thomas) off\nto recruit mercenaries. He collects a motley crew - Space Cowboy, Gelt, Nanelia, Cayman (a huge reptile), Nestor and the voluptuous St Exmin, a val kiri warrior whose ample bosom is only\njust restrained by her flimsy costumes.\nThey return to Akir for a shoot out - in true Magnificent Seven tradition (the film from which i the plot has been grafted into space). Made on a low budget, the effects add a little glitter to an\notherwise dull film. The occasional flashes of humour are enjoyable, but I doubt whether even the\nmost faithful scifi college students would find it rewarding. The still shows Cayman and his two\nsidekicks the Kelvins (thermal twins!), an example of some of the wonderful make-up used.\nPage 8 FELIX, February 20, 198/\n\n"
