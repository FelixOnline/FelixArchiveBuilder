And it came to\npass that the Honorary\nSecretary rose to his feet\namidst cheers from the\nex huber ant multitudes,\nsaying 'Minutes of the\n. . .\" when a voice from\nafar spake loud, orating\n\"Point of Order, Mr.\nChairman, have you opened the meeting?\" And it\ncame to pass that the\nChairman duly explained\nthat he had indeed opened\nthe meeting and, hearing\nthis, Mr. Gerrard (the\nvoice from afar, in case\nyou're lost like me\u2014Ed.)\nchallenged the quorum.\nBut alas, there were\nonly one hundred and\nninety seven gathered and\npresent. And the almighty\nGreen Blue Book declared\nthat insufficient, and called\nit 0.68 qu or a.

Of these one\nhas visibly improved and two, RCS Broadsheet and\nMines Newsletter, probably have since I haven't seen a copy of either yet and they couldn't get any\nfurther into the literary depths they were ripping off\nat the time.\nBroadsheet was composing its morose mixture of Private Eye re-gur g it at ions, lefty witch-hunts, jokes you'd seen\nbefore somewhere else\nand worse, some they'd thought of themselves.\nMines Newsletter had\nthe odd sports report but\notherwise was preoccupied with the dubious\nhang-up of counting pints\nof Tartan drunk by its\nown boring clique.\nGuildsheet, too, had its\nfair quota of ego tripping simplicity and esoteric\nbanality but its contributors were more numerous and various and it\n'did shoot the gaff off the\nmouldy yog our t scandal\na week before the Sunday Times, albeit on a low and local level\n(Mooney).

Sennet, its\ncounterpart from UL was\nat that time edited by\nthe illustrious, legendary\nfigure of Piers Corbyn\nand, while overstating\nits case and often enthusing into the barren\nworld of futile a spira tion, did achieve a degree of healthy controversy and lively cross-talk sadly lacking around\ntoday's spread of media.\nCEFE was around,\ntoo, but it quickly lost\nthe art of communication and succeeded in\ntalking only to itself and\nat everyone else. There\nare subtler ways of putting over a point or maybe it's the readers. I don't know.

Her employer is CARLOS FRANCETTI. a rich Italian\nbusinessman. At a party, Janice meets JOHN LIVINGSTONE, a young English doctor, and NICO, Carlos' younger brother, for whom she feels a strong\nattraction. However, it soon becomes clear that Nico is infatuated with\nLUISA, his brother's cold but beautiful wife.\nMARIO BOTTICELLI, one of the guests, becomes hysterical and tries\nto attack Janice. John tells her that Mario was once Carlos' mistress, but\nis now engaged to Luisa's brother ANGELO. Janice is disturbed by an overheard conversation which seems to hint that John and Luisa are having an\naffair.\nNext day, Carlos offers to show Janice the sights of Rome. Surprised\nand flattered, she accepts.\nNOW READ ON . . . .\nThe afternoon was hot\nand dusty, the streets\nalmost empty, for it was\nsiesta time. We spoke\nvery little; I stood still in\nawe of Carlos, for he\nwas, after all, my em-ploy er, although I would\nnot deny that he was\nalso a very attractive\nman. If only it had been\nNico, I thought with\nlonging . . . .\nWe wandered through\ndeserted back streets towards the Bridge of\nSighs. I was captivated\nby the atmosphere, the\ntimeless spell of Rome.\nBreaking a long si-len ce, he asked me\ngently, \"Why did you\ncome to Rome? Were\nyou unhappy in England?\"\nI glanced up quickly,\nmeeting the gaze of\nthose deep brown eyes\nwhich seemed to know\nso much about me. I was surprised by his\nsympathy and under-standing. But how could\nI tell him about Bill, who\nhad meant so much to\nme, and my fatal attraction for thou that had\nruined our chance of\nhappiness?\n\"I now get looks from boys\nwho are passing by in the street I\" says Jean Scully of Liverpool.\n\"I had terrible problems with my acne\nand pimples.

I remembered what Lucia had\nsaid that night. But\nsomehow, I could not believe that Carlos, who\nseemed so kind and\ngentle, would have\nstooped to such behaviour. I decided to consult Francesca as soon\nas possible. Meanwhile,\nI must try to keep my\nfeelings in check.\nCarlos' voice interrupted my reveries. Leaning on the parapet, he\nsmiled at me. \"Have you\never seen the Seine by\nmoonlight?\" I shook my\nhead. \"Everybody in\nlove should. You must\nallow me to show it to\nyou\".

In fact, much of\nCouncil's business was\nconcerned with itself, since\nit also granted itself a half-hour break in the middle\nof meetings and re-instated\nCouncil teas (something\nthat was abolished in a spate of penny-pinching at\nthe last council of last\nyear).\nBesides these monumental decisions, the only matter other than pure routine that was discussed\nwas that of the new hall,\nand there was precious\nlittle conversation about\nthat, since most people\nhad left by the time it\ncame around.\nThe only reason that\ncouncil managed to spread\nout its business to last\nuntil 10.44 was because of\nthe enormous amount of\ntime wasted by certain\ncouncil members who betrayed their extreme nai-ve te by asking the most\nstupid and irrelevant questions and by treating\npoints Of information as\nitems worthy of hours of\ndiscussion. For example,\nwhen Rob Armitage mentioned a list of union-registered coach operators\nand suggested that, if it\nwas decided to change\ncompanies in the future,\nthat the list should be con-sul ted, it developed into\nthirty minutes' discussion\n. . . and ended up where\nthey began, maintaining\nthe status quo.\n* * *\nCouncil howler of the\nweek: \"I don't want to be\nbureaucratic about this\"\n\u2014MCB\n* * *\nPRESIDENT\nSELF-ELECT?\nWhilst all these merry\ncapers were going on at\nIC Council, Master Armitage had winged his way to\nULU for the SRC (Stu-dents' Representative\nCouncil) meeting there.\nOur SRC scout reports\nthat, the elections for reps\nto various Senate committees having come around,\nour Rob stood up to propose the ICU President for\nthe Committee.\n\"But\", said Rob, \"we\nhaven't got one yet\".\n\"What you mean\", replied\nJoy Clancy, president of\nULU, \"is that you want to\npropose Rob Armitage for\nthe Committee\". Rather\npremature, perhaps. Nevertheless, Rob got elected.\nHe has since been seen\nasking amongst others the\nEd of \"Felix\" what the\nCommittee\ndoes.\n4\nc4c j(c SOMETHINGS OUT\nThe almost - forgotten\n\"Something\" has once\nagain raised its head, celebrating its first issue of\nthe year with a take-off of\n\"Feelsick\" (oops, sorry,\ntime for another Ed's com-ment, I meant \"Felix\"\u2014\nEd.). The Ed of \"Felix\"\nhas been heard to say that\nhe wishes \"Felix\" were as\ngood! Although in theory\na SocSoc publication, there\nis precious little if any\npolitical dogma contained\nin this Broadsheet-type\npublication, and seems to\nbe mainly a satirical mag.\nFortunately for us, it\ndoesn't just take off\n\"Felix\", but has digs at\neveryone else in college\ntoo. There are well-sub-st anti a ted rumours that at\nleast one high-ranking\nmember of the Union hierarchy is scared stiff of\nSomething, or rather \"is\nconcerned about this increase in the amount of\nbump h floating around\ncollege, which is exactly\nwhat we were trying to re-duce\". It is purely coincidental that this particular\nperson is the subject of\nrather a lot of criticism in\nSomething.\nAnything that adds a touch of cheer to the\nscene at IC is to be welcomed . . . but next time,\nplease, why not take off\n\"IC News\" or a broad-sheet???\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nTHE SAGA OF NORMAN AND HIS\nPROBLEM SHEETS\n\"I'm very confused.\"\n\"Why's that, Norman?\" I said.\n\"Well, I picked up this duplicated sheet \u2014 I thought it\nwas a problem sheet, actually\u2014and it didn't make\nsense.\"\n\"Problem sheets seldom do,\" I said.\n\"Yes, but I don't think this is one\u2014look.\"\n\"It looks like an election leaflet, Norman, endorsing one\nof the candidates for President of the Union.\"\n\"Oh! Well if it's about a union I'm not interested in that\nsort of thing. Anyway, I can't see how he can hope to\nget votes if he goes around saying everyone at\nImperial is a pig.\"\n\"I wouldn't think so, either, Norman. Where does he\nsay that?\"\n\"Here\u2014look.\"\n\"Oh, Norm. Don't be silly. An imperialist isn't someone\nat IC, It's a description of the Western society.\"\n\"Well, what's something like that doing in a college\nleaflet? I can't see what it's got to do with an election here.\"\n\"He believes that you can't isolate the college and the\nwhole university system from the rest of society. In\nthe same way you do other things besides your lecture\ncourse.\"\n\"I don't know about that. At least when I'm isolated I can get on with my problem sheets in peace. See,\nthey've made me do some non-technical subjects and\nI 've got a lot of books to read so I 've no time for\nanything else.\"\n\"But don't you go to any other lectures and discussions\nbesides those you're told to, Norman?\"\n\"Well, mother said go and see Mrs. Whitehouse the other\nday and she seemed to think we should all be getting\non with our studies, She was a real gas, I thought.\"\n\"Bromine,\" I said. \"But don't you read anything else\nbut what you're told to?\"\n\"Oh, yeS,\" said Norman. \"I get the Daily Telegraph on\nFridays for the colour magazine.\"\n\"I like the Smirnoff adverts,\" I said.\n\"What's thai?\"\n\"Forget it, Norm. I should get on with your problem\nsheets.\"\n\"Now\u2014totalitarian\u2014I should think that's the sum of a geometric progression.\"\n\"Yes, Norman.\"\nAds-Quorum\nSir, \u2014 I was deeply upset by the attitude of the\nExecutive of I.C. Union\nfollowing my successful\nchallenge to the quorum\nat the meeting on 19th October. An important\nmeeting, such as a hust-in gs, is worthless if there\nare only 200 people pre-sent, and yet I found myself being insulted and\nsneered at by a group of\npeople who hadn't taken\nthe trouble to advertise a meeting properly.\nIt would appear that so\nlong as they hand you a few lines to print in Felix\n(or didn't they bother to\ndo that?), that is all the\nadvertising that is needed.\nWhereas we don't want\neverywhere floating in\nbump h sheets, I think a few dye line adverts\nwouldn't have gone amiss.\nNo doubt our sabbat ic afl officers will blame the\npoor publicity on the lack\nof a publicity officer.\nOr perhaps they believed that the two \"popular\"\ncandidates might succeed\nin getting everyone along.\nYours sincerely,\nW.A. GERRARD\n(Metallurgy P.G.)P. S. Unfortunately, the\nhustings that occurred\nafter the challenge was\nperfectly legal according\nto the \"blue book\".\nAnonymity\nPreserved\nDear Sir, \u2014 Without\nwishing to elongate the\nsaga of Lin&tea d Bar\nCommittee (whom I believe are, incidentally, the\nonly committee who really\nknow how to run a bar) I feel it must be pointed out\nto Mr. Rossell that the\nprerogative to publish any\nliterature whether libel-lou s, badly spelt or true,\nlies in the artistic sense of\nthe Editor.\nIt is an indisputable\nhuman right to produce\nliterature anonymously,\nespecially in the case in\nquestion, because the\nwriter is in danger of petty\nvictim is ation in his home\nfor the year.\nIf Mr. Rossell feels\nthat this argument is his\nonly defence against the\nletter of \"the Moderator\"\none can only infer that he\nmust feel guilty (after all\nhe has been in Hall for a time exceeding his sub-warden ship) or that his\nriposte was written after\nan over-long spell in that\nubiquitous bar.\nPerhaps most important\nis this question: Should\nre-admission to Hall be\nallowed while some\npeople still have to spend\ntheir full 3 years at IC in\nsome garret in Putney.\nYours faithfully,\nTHE CHAIRMAN\nOF THE COURT OF\nHUMAN RIGHTS.\nImpartiality\nSir, \u2014 As an ordinary\nand, I hope, fair-thinking\nmember of Imperial College Union, I would like\nto complain most strongly\nabout an article in the\ncurrent issue of your\nnewspaper (No. 314). I say YOUR newspaper\nwhen What I really mean\nis OUR newspaper.\n\"Felix\" is meant to be an\nimpartial information\nsheet for the benefit of the\nmembers of the Union\nwith room for Editorial\ncomment in the Editorial\ncolumn. How then do you\nreconcile this ideal with\nthe news item on the front\npage of the issue in question concerning the forthcoming presidential ele c tion. This constituted\nnothing more than thinly\ndisguised propaganda for\nRob Armitage. Whilst Mr.\nArmitage may well be the\npreferable candidate for\nPresident, this item was\nnot the place for the editor to exercise his view on\nthis. I am sure Mr. Armitage was suitably disgusted with the article and I hope that in future the\neditor will exercise Ms\nfunction in a more efficient\nmanner in weeding out\nthis sort of article.\nYours faithfully,\nBILL COLLETT,\nMaths 3.\nEditorial comment: Thank\nyou for telling me what\n\"Felix\" is meant to be.\nUnfortunately, this must\nbe your own opinion,\nsince it certainly doesn't appear in print anywhere.\nEditorial comment is restricted to the Editorial\ncolumn by precedent only,\nand last issue was no ex-ce pti on. The front page\narticle was written by a \"Felix\" reporter for the\ninformation of members\nof IC union \u2014 // you consider it biased, that is your\nopinion. Try writing an\narticle on the subject that\nISN'T biased\\\nWhitehouse\nSir, \u2014 The report in\nIssue No. 314 on the General Studies lecture by\nMrs. Mary Whitehouse\nseems to have completely\nmissed the main point of\nthe talk.\nIt was ten minutes past\ntwo before Mrs. Whitehouse even touched upon\nthe topic of pornography\nand its association with\npolitics. The first forty\nminutes appear to have\nbeen completely forgotten\nin your review.\nMrs. Whitehouse argued that whereas students had been campaigning in past years most\nforcefully and successfully\nin such fields as student\nrepresentation she could\nnot understand why they\nwere also not concerned\nin the field of public representation affecting the\nchoice of programmes\nscreened on television.\nShe appealed to students to help correct what\nin her view was a serious\nmis balance in the presentation of certain topics on\ntelevision of which she\ngave examples together\nwith evidence of mis bal ance.\nSince it is the BBC who\nselect their panel of ad-visors, the public has little\nmeans by which to put\nacross its own views\nexcept through organisations such as the National\nViewers and Listeners Association.\nMrs. Whitehouse felt\nthat concern in this field\nwas especially relevant at\nthe present time since the\nBBC TV charter expires\nin 1976. Plans for the future of the BBC must be\ndrawn up in the next two\nyears, considering also\nthat television plays an\never increasing part in the\npresentation of ideas and\ninformation to the public.\nI hope, Sir, that in future the factual contents\nof reports on General\nStudies lectures will be\nmore precise and will not\nbe accompanied by photographs of a certain stripper whose positively revolting act a large number of Guildsmen were\nsubjected to some 2 years\nago at the Guilds' Review.\nYours faithfully,\nANDREW MAFELD\nThank you!\nSir, \u2014 I have just read\nlast weeks issue of\n\"Felix\". I must congratulate you. The standard of\nwriting, reporting, editing\nand the tone of the paper\nare much higher than I can remember seeing in a student newspaper before.\nMay I wish you and your\nBoard success in this en-ter p rise. Yours sincerely,\nD.M. HUM\n(Senior Tutor,\nMaths Dept.)\nMyDear\nEditor . . .\nSir, \u2014 As a Civil Engineering P.G., I have\nbeen disillusioned so far\nwith this years' FELIX.\nMy criticisms are twofold:\n1. The lack of articles\nor either quality or quan-t it y. The advertisement on\nthe back page of the last\nissue regarding the \"Sir\nArthur Ackland English\nEssay Prize\" appears relevant to some of your staff\nand perhaps to some of\nthe faceless journalists\nwriting imaginary articles\nin vacant spaces of\n\"Felix\". Paragraph 1\nstates \"the object of the\ncompetition is to encourage good writing of English\". I think Felix could\ndo with the practice. One\nof the suggested titles is\n\"An Optimist's Appraisal\nof the Future\". Think\nabout it.\n2. My second criticism\nfalls on you, my dear Editor, for a complete lack of\nEditorial control and an\nexcess of editorial license\n(should that be licence,\ndear Editor? You of all\npeople should know) (Yes,\nI do \u2014 you were right\nsecond try. Ed.)\nWhy is there no structural format or layout for\nour weekly paper? Did\nthe headline \"Would you\nbuy a used car from\nthese men\" refer to the\nelections or the NUS con-ference? Take a look, dear\nEditor (Don't need to, I can remember it, Ed.)\nJudging by the attendance\nat the last IC UGM I think it could have been\nthe latter.\nWhy does the calendar\nfor the week appear in\nprint similar to a telephone directory? (it\ndoesn't \u2014 take a look at\na telephone directory,\ndear Mr. Jowitt). Don't tell me, you would like a \"Sabbatical Art Consultant\" to help you out.\n(Not on your life, Ed.)\nI suggest that you trade\nyour editorial cynicism of\nthe last few weeks for\neditorial control of \"your\"\npaper.\nThis letter is written by\nP. Jowitt, Civ. Eng. PG.,\nnot ICU Dep Pres, and is\nwritten to the Editor of\n\"Felix\", not Oily Dowson,\nEditor of \"Felix\", or, for\nthat matter, Oily Dowson,\nhuman being. I hope noone construes it as destructive criticism, or a personality clash.\nYours till the cows\ncome home.\nPAUL JOWITT\nAnother bit of Editorial\nLicence: I shall do everything to encourage the\nstaff of \"Felix\" to enter\nthe Essay Competition.\nYou never know, I might\ndo so myself. Your comments about the design aspect are quite justified \u2014\nthe omission of lines to\ndivide articles and heads\nwas a printing error, by\nthe way and was not a \"Felix\" design fault to\nthe best of my knowledge.\n\"Felix\" is to have a new\nimage anyway from the\n21st November issue . . .\nbut wait and see for that.\nArticles of quality, I sup-pose, disappeared when\nyou stopped writing for\n\"Felix\". As for quantity,\nthis issue is over matter to\nthe order of 50 per cent,\nand much of the scheduled articles to be run in\nthese pages have had to\nbe held over.\nWelcome to\nMooney\nDear Sir,\nAs a reciprocal gesture\nto RCA not allowing IC\nstudents to use their refectory during normal\nhours could not a notice\nbe posted around IC to\nthe effect that RCA people\nmay use Mooney at all\ntimes and, furthermore,\nobtain a large discount for\nthe privilege.\nYours Nourishingly,\nMartin Doughty,\n(Civ Eng PG).\n\n"

Everyone was very hadn't experienced it.\nIAN MACKENZIE ON\nthe non\u2014UGM the new hall\nThe attendance at last Thursday's scheduled IC\nUnion Meeting was very poor. Despite the meeting being boldly advertised on page 2 of \"Felix\" and on\nhalf-a dozen posters around college. It was hoped that\nadvertising in a WEEKLY \"Felix\" would cut out the\nnecessity to produce large amounts of extra bump h, but it certainly seems that reminding people ON THE\nDAY is the only way.\nEven allowing for the low turnout of about 200\npeople (the quorum is 300) the challenge to the quorum\nmade little or no sense. Such challenges are normally\nkept for a time when controversial business is being\ndiscussed and where there is a possibility of a non-representative outcome. At last Thursday's meeting almost all the business was either matters of information\nor report or the hustings. The exception was amendments to the NUS motions. The quorum challenge right\nat the start thus threatened to waste everyone's time.\nThankfully, most people stayed for the ensuing\n\"Meeting of IC Students\" and heard the Presidential\nHustings (which in fact don't need to be in a Union\nMeeting) and from Joy Clancy, ULU President.\nDebsoc\nrises\nDebating lines! IC Debating Society held their first\ndebate of the year last Tuesday.

Anders, at[ fs0?i at y m* fn\n%\nplease drop us a line in the\nfreshman PG in Chem. sc crack in t ne Union\nEng, and he was awarded Lower Lounge.\nWith the accommodation situation getting worse\nevery year, the urgent need to provide a further hall\nof residence is felt by everyone in the college. After\nall, we have already got two available sites i.e. an\nextension of Linstead Hall towards Weeks, and the site\nabove the sports centre (Northside). Here, the foundations for the hall are already in place. All that is needed is sufficient money to pay for the building.\nNEW HALLS COST MONEY\nThe problem of finance is serious, as the University\nGrants Committee will only entertain a relatively small\nsubsidy if the cost per student bed is kept below about\n\u00a32,000. Over the last year our Hall fees have contained\na levy of 35p per week per room which goes to the\nnew hall fund. The surplus from the largely student\nrun Summer Vacation letting scheme, also goes to this\nend. Add to this a donation of \u00a3150,000 from the\nQueensgate trust and the amount still needed is within\nthe limits of a loan.\nThus the hall is \"loan financed\" and is just financially viable at the moment, provided the most economic building methods are used to accommodate the\nmaximum number of students.\nWith soaring building costs, the need to get plans\nformulated and a tender accepted quickly is obvious.\nANOTHER SOUTHSIDE?\nThe Northside Hall is not intended to be another\nSoutbside\u2014far from it. The basic concept which the\nUnion, pressed for last year, was a system of flat lets, each containing its own cooking and sitting room areas.\nA design has been prepared by the college appointed\narchitects which we shall be suggesting improvements\nto it, bearing in mind that the industrial building\nmethod employed and the lay out of services such as\nthe lift shaft make major redesign impractical.\nOVER 250 PLACES\nAll in all, the hall should accommodate well over\n250 students. A few double rooms are provided which\ncould be used for married students.\nAn open meeting to discuss the plans was held last\nFriday, but if anyone who missed that and has a burning desire to contribute, the plans will be in the\nUnion Office till Wednesday lunchtime.\nNext week in Felix:\nPLANS FOR NEW\nHALL IN DETAIL\nExclusive Revelations\nBIG BROTHER\nS WATCHING YOU!\nDear Acting President,\nThe situation in our Canteen re latin q to queues\nand serving RCA students alone is always difficult.\nHowever, due to the forward looking attitude of the\nSRC, we have never become selfish and operated a ban on I.C. students using our Canteen.\nIt seems that this year the problem is particularly\nbad and I am, therefore, writing to appeal to you to\ninform your students that they should recognise\nour difficulties and abide by the previous agreement\nthat they should only use our Canteen after 1 p.m. at lunch time and 6 p.m. in the evening.\nThere are notices to this effect up at the RCA but\nit seems to be ignored by your students. In previous\nyears, strong demand for an I.C. ban were voiced\nat SRCs, alas there is talk of this again. I would,\npersonally, regret it very much if the SRC here\nagreed to such a policy, so it would help me from\nthat point of view also if you would give some\nthought as to the best way of getting your members\nto show a little more consideration towards our\nsituation.\nYours sincerely, '\nBryan Webb,\nPresident R.C.A.

This\nwas how it remained\nuntil half time.\nIC turned round With a fitter and more mobile\npack \u2014 the Cheshunt\npack were visibly flaking\nin the last 10 minutes of\nthe 1st half. A long kick\nout was fumbled by\nCheshunt and from the\nresulting scrum James\ndropped a goal from in\nfront of the posts to make\nit 3-3. IC were really on\nthe boil now, and from a peel at a line out, prop\nBruce Bradley went\nthrough the Cheshunt defence through a centre\nthree quarter. After a magnificent 40 yard run, he\nfound the rest of the IC\npack in support and they\npromptly won the ruc k which had formed for the\nball to travel out to the\nwing where J. Hunt\nscored in the corner \u2014\nthe try being converted by\nD.

The wing\ncross kicked and the\nCheshunt wing forward\nscored under the posts.

On Thursday, October 19,\nGwenneth Pryor, who has performed at these concerts before, played a beautiful programme of\nDebussy and Schubert.\n'Suite pour le piano' is one of Debussy's earlier\nworks and it displays the new possibilities that he\nrevealed for the pianoforte. The interpretation by\nGwenneth Pryor was much liked by the audience\nof over 60 people who packed the library. It was\ninteresting to compare the styles of the two composers in the programme\u2014the genius of Schubert\nwith his sudden contrasts and the originality of\nDebussy with his summing up of the pianist ic discoveries of the nineteenth century.\nThe second piece of the two in the programme\nwas the Piano Sonata in B flat (D960) by Schubert.\nHis sonatas need a performance of great strength\nof purpose, determination and uncommon inspiration to really succeed and Gwenneth Pryor certainly succeeded. Her playing showed the true lyrical beauty of the piece and there can be no doubt\nthat her recital in the Purcell Room in the near\nfuture will be a succ s s. Those present at the maths library that afternoon\nlook forward to a return visit by Gwenneth Pryor.\nThe next recital in this series Will be on the 2nd of November.\nANDREW MAFELD\nrecords\nLUMPY GRAVY: FRANK ZAPPA AND THE\nABNUCEALS EMUUKHA ELECTRIC SYMPHONY\nORCHESTRA AND CHORUS\n'I worked in a cheesy newspaper company for a while but that was terrible. I wasn't making enough\nmoney to build anything. Then I worked in a printing company, and a couple of gas stations. Oh, at\nthe gas station where I was working, my brother\nhad just gotten married, and he'd bought a new car, and his wife was having a kid, and all this\nmiserable stuff, and he needed a job so I gave him\nmy job at the gas station from which I was fired\nbecause you know he was going to work there. And\nhe had his car on the rack and he got fired because\nhe was goofing out man, and he just kept taking\nparts and working on his car day and night . . .\nand I went to work in an aircraft company and I was building these planes, I worked on the XB70 I was the last welder on that, but it was pretty good\nbread because I was making 2-71 an hour and\n100i a week . . . so I got an Oldsmobile, a groovy\nOlds . . .' etc.\nThe most explicit stimulating and beautiful piece\nof prose in the English Language? Well, perhaps\nnot. Actually I doubt if Euclid James 'Motorhead'\nSherwood so named, as you may have guessed,\nbecause of his preoccupation with cars, thought\nthat either, but he probably didn't know that Frank\nZappa was going to immortalize his mechanical\nachievements on record.\n'Lumpy Gravy' was recorded originally in the\nSpring of 1967; although release was delayed until\nMay 1968 to make way for 'We're Only In It for\nthe Money' and basically features various members\nof the Mothers of Invention and their entourage,\nnotably Motorhead, Bunk Gardner and Pamela\nZarubica discussing pigs, ponies round things and\nother items of total non-interest interspersed with\nsome original and occasionally totally beautiful\nmusic, particularly the opening four or five minutes.\nIn fact most of the melodies have since been used\nfor better known Zappa songs; I picked out 'Bwana\nDik' from 'Mothers Live', 'Oh No' from 'Weasels\nRipped my Flesh', 'Mother People' and 'Take your\nclothes off when you dance' from 'Only Money',\n'King Kong' from 'Uncle Meat' and 'Magdalena'\nfrom 'Just another Band from L.A.'I would heartily recommend this music but it\nhas to be admitted that it amounts to less than half\nof the album and unless you like avant-garde chat\nshows you probably won't feel this is worth the\nmoney. And much as I applaud Polydor for making\nthis and all the early Mothers albums available\nonce more in this country I'm sure that the world\nwasn't ready for 'Lumpy Gravy' when it first came\nout and I doubt if it's ready now.\nSID AMOR lou reed\nIt was a night of true Western Decadence in\nthe Great Hall on Saturday. Aside from the hypo-der mic s, methadone capsules and bloodstains that\nwere found in the gents after the concert Lou Reed\nwas singing songs about Berlin and butch ladies\nof the Thirties, and teaching us (well, me at least)\nabout himself, the Velvet Underground in which\nhe became a legend in his own lifetime, and indeed\nabout popular music itself. Whether everyone of\nthe capacity audience analysed the concert in as\ntotally in artistic a fashion as I did I don't know;\nI hope not, but f hey certainly went away satisfied\nand he wasn't even wearing any make-up!\nFor the uninitiated, Lou Reed left the Velvet\nUnderground in August 1970, and shortly afterwards had a nervous breakdown. He next appeared\non the scene early this year when he came to London to record a \"solo\" album backed up by some\nof the most accomplished session men in Britain\nand returned midsummer for a series of concert\ndates. Since then he has done two tours and his\nappearance at I.C. may well be his last in London\nbefore he returns to the States. Since his arrival he\nhas been backed by a group who I believe are called\n\"The Tots\", although he did not mention them at\nall during the act. Despite the bass-player's attempts to overshadow his boss completely by his\npon c ing around, the Tots are a very competent\nbunch of musicians and this is what interested me\nparticularly \u2014 their super slick togetherness when\napplied to songs like \"White Light/White Heat\"\nand \"I'm Waiting for My Man\" completely\nchanged the impression left by the songs, by removing the spontaneity and crude enthusiasm which\npaperbacks\n\"The Mating Game\" by June Johns (Pan, 30p) Sex, love and courtship in the zoo? Fascinating\ndisclosures on the savage lovemaking of tigers, the\nmoral rectitude of Emperor Penguins, the frantic\nsexual demands made on sea lions in the mating\nseason, the courting rituals of flamingoes, snakes\nand elephants . . . and not a piece of human genitalia to be seen anywhere.\nWell, it may be all very interesting, however\nwhat use is it? It is not for instance the sort of\nmaterial you could let fly at a dinner party. Could\nyou imagine this: \"I say, did you know that the\nmale hippo has a backward-pointing penis?\" That\nshould stop any hostess in her tracks.\nJune Johns has come out with a veritable animal\nequivalent of Tom Jones. Her book is well written,\nand I must admit at times fascinating. It must be\na difficult subject to write about in layman's terms,\nand from any point of view it is easy to criticise a non-scientific approach as cashing in on the sex-e rama. While it may be true that man has a lot to learn\nfrom animals, and in particular their courtship and\nmating behaviour, I found Miss Johns had really\nonly skipped around the animal kingdom, taking\nexamples from where it suited her theme best.\nThe photographs add very little to the text in\nwhat to my mind is an unnecessary and pointless\nbook. Perhaps the mediocrity of the whole thing is\nshown up best by the captions on the cover\u2014from\nthe Western Mail, the Evening News and the Manchester Evening News. Couldn't they do better\nthan that?\nMy advice is to forget it and stick to Penthouse.\nDAVE HOB MAN characterised the original versions. To people who\nhave heard the originals so many times, like the\nwriter who described their version of \"Heroin\" as\na travesty (\"F him\", said Lou), this may\nhave been disappointing but I did get the impression that as much care and musical thought has\ngone into these arrangements, although I did miss\nthe screeching violin and feedback on \"Heroin\".\nAnd of course the crowd loved it anyway.\nAll of Mr. Reed's repertoire consisted of \"well-worn winners\", and every song except one was received with wild applause. That one was \"The only\npop song I ever wrote,\", \"Who Lover the Sun\",\nfrom the \"Loaded\" album \u2014 the heavy brigade\nwere obviously out in force. The songs from the\nlast two Velvet albums and Lou Reed's solo album\nseemed to go down much better than the early\nstuff; perhaps that's because this is more of a studio group. \"Sweet Jane\", the latter day Reed\nclassic, and \"Rock and Roll\" were particularly ef-fec ti ve. \"We can play all night, can't we?\" drawled Lou\nin a voice as New Yorky as a mugger in Central\nPark. \"Yes!\" called the audience. \"No\", said the\nEnts Chairman. So, as midnight drew closer, \"First\nwe'll play my choice and then we'll play yours\".\nHis choice proved to be \"Head Held High\" and the\naudience's was, predictably \"Sister Ray\". It began\nas an ethereal jam reminiscent of the Allman\nBrothers. \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\", with\nLou playing lines rather than chords for the first\ngroup number of the evening. Pity they didn't have\nall night really.\nSID AMOR what's on\nOCTOBER\nMon. 23 - Fri. 27: Lunchtimes. Poster and information display in J. C.R.
