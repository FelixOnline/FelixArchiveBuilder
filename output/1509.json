    "content": "Sex, drugs, violence, and My Little Pony\nH\nalf way through its second sea-son, Felix has yet to review My\nLittle Pony: Friendship is Magic.\nShame. The oddly popular TV series based on the line of Hasbro\ntoys has gained immense popularity since it debuted in 2010, spawning an entire subculture of\nfans older than the target demographic, known\nas Bronies and Pega-sisters.\nIf somehow you have been oblivious to the\narrival of My Little Pony (MLP), a summary is\nrequired. Each episode follows a roughly similar structure: One of the mane (see what I did\nthere?) six ponies typically encounters an event\nthat disrupts everyday life. Only by working together as a team and using the magic of friendship are they are able to overcome their difficulties and save the day. Far from being formulaic,\nthe show is able to use this skeletal template to\ntheir advantage, with enough variety and subsidence to entertain the older fans whilst keeping it\nsuitable for younger audience members.\nCritics of the show will often stress the simplicity of the themes, and the fact that the show\nis aimed at young girls. Fans of the show will\nretort that the series in fact tackles deep moral\nissues and struggles that people of all ages can\nassociate with. For example, the season one episode \u2018Bridle Gossip\u2019 depicts how the residents\nof Ponyville fear a zebra because she is different\nand unknown. The episode is resolved when the\nponies are able to realise their casual racism is\nwrong and befriend the zebra.\nThe show was developed by Lauren Faust,\nwhose previous work includes The Powerpuff\nGirls and Foster\u2019s Home for Imaginary Friends.\nAward winning composer Daniel Igram includes\na variety of themes in his music for MLP, ranging from Broadway parodies (\u2018At the Gala\u2019) to\ngospel choir tracks (\u2018Hush Now Lullaby\u2019).\nThe show\u2019s popularity with older audiences\nis due in large part to Hasbro\u2019s unusual decision to allow fans to post and edit clips and full\nepisodes online (take that, SOPA and ACTA).\nThis allowed the community to flourish, with it\ngrowing at a tremendous rate. It is also notable\nthat Hasbro actively works with the community,\nincorporating feedback from fans directly into\nthe show.\nDerpy Hooves (whose cross-eyed expression\nwas left in as part of an animator\u2019s joke) was\nspotted in the very first episode of season one\nand quickly became a fan favourite, inspiring\na \u201cWhere\u2019s Wally?\u201d style game between the\nshow\u2019s artists and fans. She was recently made\ncanon when she had a speaking role in \u2018The Last\nRoundup\u2019.\nIn an era when the majority of entertainment\navailable is sex, drug or violence related it is\ngenuinely refreshing to find a show that promotes integrity, morals and staying true to your-self. Sure, you might not like all of the main six\nequally (you will love them all though!), but this\nshow has something for anyone willing to give\nit a try.\nAll broadcast episodes of My Little Pony:\nFriendship is Magic are available on YouTube\nin 1080p. The next episode \u2018Read It and Weep\u2019\nwill be broadcast Saturday 4 February on The\nHub and will be available on YouTube later that\nday.\nSam Flynn gives us the lowdown from Ponyville, and proof that anything we get sent does actually get printed\nA still from the musical number \u2018At the Gala\u2019 from the episode \u2018Best Night Ever\u2019\n\u201cRule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions.\u201d\nJunior Doctors: Your Life in their Hands is back!\nAfter a first series in Newcastle General Hospital\nand the Royal Victoria Infirmary, eight newly-qualified doctors hit the wards of the Chelsea and\nWestminster Hospital. After getting their MBBS,\nfor the first time, they have to deal with real life\nand death situations and take on the responsibility\nof taking care of patients.\nFour junior doctors are ex-Imperial students. Aki\nis described as \u201cKensington meets Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll\u201d\nand easily pictured in the Reynolds bar; he is\n\u201cMess President\u201d now, basically in charge of organising parties for the doctors. Ben is a rugby\nlad (probably in a centrefold), very popular with\nthe ladies and doing his second foundation year\nin child surgery. Priya once dreamt of becoming\na Bollywood actress and now works in general\nsurgery. Sameer is a Harry Potter fan, threatened\nwith an arranged marriage by his family and produces entertaining quotes like \u201cI\u2019d describe myself\nas fun\u2026 fair\u2026 not funfair\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d like to treat\nextra-terrestrials\u201d, \u201cthe alien master race\u201d.\nThe other four junior doctors come from different universities across the country. Amieth is quite\nlaidback, not sure a quality you\u2019d look for in a\ndoctor, but so far nothing dramatic has happened.\nAndy is the youngest doctor working for the hospital and apparently incapable of growing facial hair.\nLucy is absolutely lovely, described as an English\nrose by one of her patients. When the last junior\ndoctor, Milla, was introduced, I almost expected\n\u2018Midnight City\u2019 by M83 (the Made in Chelsea\ntheme tune) to come on. She loves balls and hats\nand was inspired to become a doctor when she was\na child to keep her parents alive and healthy for-ever. Cheesy but kind of cute.\nThe last thing to say about the first two episodes\nis that they are uneventful. Breach of doctor-patient\nconfidentiality, multiple failures at fitting a cannu-Imperial Medics in BBC3 reality show\nMarie-Laure Hicks la in, putting a finger up a patient\u2019s arse, certifying\na death and a phone ringing during reanimation,\nyou will not be bored, maybe just a bit concerned\nabout your next trip to the hospital. Although apparently you can get sandwiches in A&E.\nThe show is great. The producers have made\na real effort for the soundtrack, with lyrics completely adapted to the situation. If you are a medical drama junkie like me, it provides you with all\nthe medicine you want without leaving out the\npersonal experience and emotional aspect. As the\njunior doctors gradually learn how to do the job,\nyou are given the opportunity of a window into the\nworld of hospitals and patients. The only disappointing aspect of this new series for me is that\nI really miss the previous junior doctors: Suzi the\nBarbie girl, gorgeous Adam, Andy, Katherine, Jon,\nKeir and Lucy.\n\u201cIf you are a medical\ndrama junkie like me, it\nprovides you with all the\nmedicine you want without\nleaving the personal\nexperience...\u201d\nWant to win Michael Portillo\u2019s\nGreat British Railway Journeys?

Students across all years either diligently trek to the library every evening\nor pass it completely (as in, walk awkwardly\naround the redundant new library porch) to go\nstraight to the Union.\nHowever, when it comes to academic suc-cess, there seems to be no such correlation.\nBlame your department, blame your note taking skills or even blame the annual arrival\nof the American girls tempting you into the\ndepths of Metric, but new research has shown\nyour academic floundering or success could be\ndown to your genes. A paper published online\nin Nature this week has taken the first step in\nactually quantifying how genetics can influence cognitive ability, but take their findings\nwith a pinch of salt - intrinsic aptitude alone\nwon\u2019t get you that 2:1.\nThe study lead by Ian Brady, a professor of\nDifferential Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, has allowed an insight not just into intelligence causation but also intelligence degeneration over time, thanks to data uncovered from\nthe early 20th century that was collected across\nScotland. Using a traditional cognitive testing\nmethod in conjunction with high tech genomic\nsequencing, test scores from a group of unrelated\nindividuals were recorded at two distinct times in\ntheir lives, and then compared against the genetic\nvariation between the groups.\nThe test used was the Moray House Test\n(not that House), and is very similar in structure to entrance tests usually taken for Grammar school entry by 11 year olds, sometimes\nreferred to as the 11-plus. A combination of\nverbal reasoning questions were asked to just\nunder two thousand participants aged 11 back\nin 1932 and 1947, and the same individuals\nwere tracked down when they were aged 70 to\nFELIX\nFriday 03 February 2012\n10\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nZero-point energy fluctuations\nfirst seen in solid object\nAt a temperature of absolute zero, any atom or\nmolecule will still vibrate as it has a minimum thermal energy known as zero-point energy. For the\nfirst time, evidence of zero-point energy has been\nseen in a solid object larger than a single atom or\ncluster \u2013 a silicon bar 12 micrometres long and\nless than a micrometre in diameter.\nLight reflected off an object will be red- or blue-shifted depending upon whether it is travelling\naway from or towards you, and according to classical mechanics, an oscillating object will reflect\nan equal amount of red-shifted light as it does\nblue-shifted; otherwise, it would show that the object has net movement towards or away from the\nobserver. However, at temperatures near absolute\nzero where quantum mechanics dominates, an object oscillating at its zero-point energy cannot emit\nenergy to its environment, and thus cannot blue-shift any light reflected off it.\nScientists at the California Institute of Technology cooled the silicon bar to within less than half\na kelvin of absolute zero, and fired a laser at it. By\nmeasuring the reflected light, they saw an asymmetry between the red and blue-shifted reflec-tions, showing that the bar spent around 30% of\nits time in its zero-point energetic ground state.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.033602\nKeir Little\nI can\u2019t see anything in this solid sphere\ntake the same test under the same standardised\nconditions. They also gave a cell sample to determine how strong the genetic link may turn\nout to be.\nTheir genomes were then scrutinised to produce Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)\ndata. SNPs are particular points in the genome\nsequence where one fraction of the species\npopulation has one nucleotide type, and another substantial fraction has another type. SNPs\ntherefore can be used to give an insight into\nthe possible genetic causes of varying characteristics between individuals in the same\npopulation, in this case intelligence. Over half\na million SNPs were scrutinised for every individual who took the test, and Brady was able\nto put forward the estimate that 24% percent\nof their cognitive ability is determined by the\ngenes due to the differences in the scores between the two age groups.\nSo does this mean that about a quarter of our\nintelligence is genetically determined from the\nstart? Not necessarily, as the overall statistics\nare a bit sketchy and the Moray House Test is\njust one of many ways to test intelligence, so\na greater, more detailed study may be needed.\nA greater genetic insight is needed too, such\nas locating specific gene sequences, but this\nresearch does provide a new understanding on\nwhich to base future neurological studies into\nintelligence and its causation.\nHowever, if 24% of your intelligence is actually genetic alone, that means that 76% is\nstill down to you.

The MIT group submitted their pa-per, \u201cNearly Optimal Sparse Fourier Transform\u201d to ArXiv on 12 January and presented\ntheir findings in the Symposium on Discrete\nAlgorithms (SODA) last week.\nThe Fourier Transform is a popular means\nof mathematical analysis which decomposes\nfunctions into their constituent frequencies.\nThe Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is\na realisation of this as an algorithm which\ntakes a sequence of real or complex numbers to process information stored in com-puters, with uses in academic areas in Computer Science and mathematics. The Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT) is a set of algorithms which are able to efficiently compute\nthe DFT in a significantly faster time. FFTs\nhave been hailed as the Swiss Army Knife\nof algorithms, with wide ranging applications in graphics (image processing, filters),\ndigital signal processing (reconstructing a\nsignal from frequency data), compression,\noptics, crystallography and data searching.\nFFTs work by performing a variety of\noptimisations on the DFT. Speeding up elements within the summation equation, such\nas the amount of multiplication operations\ninvolved, allows for reduced processor usage during the algorithm\u2019s execution. This\nincreases efficiency significantly, but there\nis no known proof which dictates the FFT\nis the fastest algorithm for computing the\nDFT. Renowned MIT mathematician Gilbert\nStrang has described the FFT as the \u201cmost\nimportant algorithm of our generation\u201d.\nThe MIT researchers\u2019 new algorithm,\ncoined the Sparse Fourier Transform (sFFT),\nimproves on the FFT by considering a signal\nto be a product of narrower slices of band-width. With this, the signals are treated as\noscillations rather than binary up/down di-rections, and the same slice of bandwidth\ncan be sampled at different times to better\ndetermine where the dominant frequencies\nare. This strategy, notable for its use in 4G\ncellular networks, allows for sparse (heav-ily weighted) frequencies to be identified\nfaster. As a result, the algorithm\u2019s worst\ncase efficiency is equivalent to the FFT,\nbut the average case is an improvement for\nmany general input signals.\nThe sFFT algorithm, developed by two\nprofessors from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) along with their students,\nhas been described by Professor Martin\nStrauss from the University of Michigan\nas \u201cgreatly [expanding] the number of circumstances where one can beat the traditional FFT\u201d.\nFaster Fast Fourier Transform found\nAlexander Karapetian\nPhilippa Skett\nThe Guardian\n\n"

With their DIY aesthetic and\nbarely any songs touching three min-utes, the band channel true punk spirit\nto make something which is up there\nwith No Age\u2019s releases. Many will\nbe put off by the abrasive nature of\n\u2018Rip It Off\u2019 but I would implore you\nto give this album a try because I have\nfound that it is not just another lo-fi\nhipster bullshit offering; there is real\nbeauty beneath.\nneed more drugs\u201d is so stripped down\nthat a chill crawled down my spine. Obviously, the lo-fi production value will\nnot appeal to everyone\u2019s tastes but there\nis a certain urgency and visceral thrill\nwhich comes with abandoning any pretence of gloss. In fact, I will go so far\nas to claim that the world has become\nso auto-tuned that it is entirely refreshing to find a beautiful bubble-gum chorus beneath layers of heavy distortion\nas in \u2018Teen Drama\u2019. In the garden of\nmodern pop there are so many daisies\ndressed up as roses that to actually find\none fragrant and beautiful flower which\nmanages to grow in a suffocating environment of feedback and screeching\nguitars is such a wonderful experience.\nOther highlights on the album include\n\u2018Mean God\u2019 and \u2018Another Day\u2019 which\nare both listenable to by people who\ncannot get into lo-fi. For those of you\nTimes New Viking\u2019s third album Rip It\nOff, their first to be released on Matador Records, became the darling of\nthe so called \u2018shitgaze\u2019 scene. Whichever Pitchfork employee exhausted\nthe synonym function on his computer\nto come up with such labels as witch\nhouse, chillwave and nu-gaze certainly\nsurpassed his or herself by dreaming\nup the genre of shitgaze. It was a short\nlived explosion of lo-fi guitar wailings\ntrying to overshadow its more sullen\nolder brother, shoegaze. At first it was\nhard to comprehend such a proposition\nas anything but a joke that I couldn\u2019t\nfind the punchline for. Yet there have\nbeen some promising bands to emerge,\nnamely the gut-wrenching fuzz of A\nPlace To Bury Strangers and the\ndreamy distortion of Times New Viking. Revisiting the latter\u2019s best re-lease, Rip It Off, and having discovered\nhow impressive it was, I refuse to let it\nbe forgotten in some scene which has\nlost its hipster appeal.\nThe best song on the album is \u2018My\nHead\u2019 with its anti-poetic, discordant\nlyrics nestled in a bed of feedback.

The feature started off highlighting\nelectronic music labels that were either\ndoing big things at that time or labels\nthat should just be known due to their\nimpact on music. I suppose this one\nfalls into both categories.\nOccasionally, music labels become\nsynonymous with an individual scene\nor genre, probably the most famous\nexample of this being Motown in the\n1960\u2019s. These days, with the almost\nnegligible price of production software\nand the ease at which music can be\nspread around the world, few labels ever\nget chance to develop such a standing.\nStones Throw is a label which has done\njust that. Heralding from Los Angeles,\nwith close links to Brainfeeder, Stones\nThrow has become home to some of the\nmost creative and influential hip-hop\nartists of the past decade. The label itself was set up by Peanut Butter Wolf,\na DJ and crate-digger from California,\nwhose love for vinyl is reflected by the\nlabel\u2019s policy of releasing music on big\nslabs of black plastic (usually accompanied by wonderful artwork).\nJ Rocc, Aloe Blacc and, recently,\nD\u00e2m Funk have all put out records on\nthe imprint, showing the increasing diversity championed by the label; instrumental hip-hop, soul and modern funk\nall being covered. Yet it is the work of\nthe late J Dilla and the vast output of\nMadlib in his many guises that really\ndefines the sound that Stones Throw is\nfamous for: beats so smooth and inven-TECHNO\nNONSENSE\nSimon Hunter\non the beat scene\ngroundbreakers\ntive that the use of an MC is simply un-necessary. That\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t\nhear any rapping on Stones Throw\u2019s\nreleases; take Madlib\u2019s recent collaboration with Freddie Gibbs on the\nwonderful Thuggin\u2019 EP for example.\nHowever, for me at least, it\u2019s always\nthe instrumental work that really shines\nthrough. It\u2019s hard to exaggerate the influence this label has had and still does\nhave on so much of electronic music\ntoday; James Blake\u2019s most recent EP\nsamples a record put out by Stones\nThrow in 2000 while Donuts and Madvillainy, by J Dilla and Madlib (in conjuction with MF Doom) respectively,\nare constantly cited as two of the best\nhip-hop albums of the last decade.\nAnd so normally at the end of this column I give some tips to get you started\nexploring the labels I feature. This time\nthough I think it\u2019d be fitting to tell y\u2019all\nto just come down to Scala this Sunday (5th Feb.) instead.

There simply won\u2019t be a\nbetter showcase of what Stones Throw\nis all about.\nWith powerful guitar riffs, Oli\nClipsham surely knows how to\nstart up all of the songs from his\nlatest EP Because Even Crooks\nCan Act.

In order to face\nflu pandemics, scientists need to carry out\nresearch on the various strains of the virus\nto better understand how they mutate and\nspread from animal reservoirs to humans.\nHowever, new research on a mutated\nstrain of the H5N1 virus, more commonly\nknown as bird flu or avian influenza, has\nbeen put on hold for 60 days in order to\nquell public fears and spark debate on the\ntopic of research involving potentially lethal influenza strains.\nFears began to circulate in September of\nlast year when two independent research\ngroups in the US and the Netherlands created a mutant strain of the H5N1 virus\nin order to find out how mutations in the\nvirus made it easier to transmit. It transpired that the virus could be transmitted\nvia inhalation between ferrets breathing\nthe same air. This strongly suggested that\nthe mutant virus could transmit just as\neasily from human to human. Whilst the\nlabs were both classified as BSL-3 (Bio-safety Level 3) enhanced, second only to\nBSL-4 in protection, fears abounded that it\nwas simply not sufficient for such a lethal\npathogen that combined the transmissibil-ity of seasonal flu with the high mortality\nrate of wild-type H5N1.\nControversy arose when, on December\n20, the US National Science Advisory\nBoard for Biosecurity (NSABB) called\nfor the two papers on the mutant virus,\nwhich had been submitted to Nature and\nScience, to be partially censored, fearing\nthe methodology within them could be\nutilized by bioterrorists. The advice drew\ncriticism from all angles, ranging from\ncomplaints that partial print could hamper further research to the claim that the\nNSABB\u2019s advice was too little, too late,\nconsidering how much of the research had\nalready been passed on to other influenza\nlabs. The authors of the papers agreed to\nthis redaction, under the understanding\nthat the research could be passed on to legitimate influenza researchers.\nPutting a pause on influenza research\nIn order to quell the fears and answer\nthe questions provoked by the media\nstorm that arose from their research a joint\nstatement was made by the two labs on\nJanuary 20 that put a 60 day pause on their\nresearch. The teams called for an international forum with which to discuss the potential benefits and risks of their research,\nas well as set up a framework for distributing their findings without letting it fall into\nthe hands of those who would abuse it.\nThe question remains whether or not\nthis form of research is necessary, or if it\nis simply a pandemic waiting to happen.\nThe 60 day pause is much welcomed, and\neven if it does not resolve the main issues\nit will allow the scientific community to\ndebate these ideas in an open forum, as\nwell as assure the public that the research\nis not being carried out either haphazardly\nor without a defined purpose.\nWhilst research into influenza spread\nand pandemic management is undeniably\nuseful, safety must take precedence over\nspeed \u2013 whilst transferring the study to\nBSL-4 graded laboratories may slow research the virus in question is without a\ndoubt highly dangerous and must be treated accordingly. Care must also be taken\nwith the freedom of print. Whilst the free\nflow of ideas drives scientific progress\nwe unfortunately live in a world where,\nmore than ever, information can be used\nto cause major harm if procured by the\nwrong people. In the next 60 days it is imperative that a method of securely distributing data and information is laid out in\norder to keep pushing influenza research\nforward. It will by no means come easily,\nbut it must.\nLaurence Pope\n?\n?\nDon\u2019t miss the Private Housing\nTalk on Monday 5 March 2012!\nwww.facebook.com/\nimperialstudentaccommodation\nLearn more at:\nLearn more at:\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation\nMoving out of halls and thinking about\nMoving out of halls and thinking about\naccommodation\naccommodation for next year?\nfor next year?\nJoin us for:\nJoin us for:\n\u00bb advice on moving out of halls\n\u00bb tips and advice on when and where\nto start looking for a place to live in the private sector\n\u00bb learning how much you can expect to pay for rent and other costs\n\u00bb advice on your rights as a tenant and how to deal with landlords and\ntheir contracts\n\u00bb tips on moving in/out\n\u00bb exclusive opportunities to meet estate agents, landlords and other\naccommodation service providers\nWhen and where:\nWhen and where:\n16.30 Exhibition opens in the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms\n18.00 Talk in the Great Hall\n19.00 Exhibition continues with\na FREE prize draw to win an iPad 2!\nSponsored by\n\n"

Sport editor gripes aside, I am pleased to present this week\u2019s interviewees: the lovely\nAnnabelle Mayers, handball women\u2019s\ncaptain, and the dashing Stefan Bauer \u2013\ngoalkeeper extraordinaire and a founding member of the club. As we sit down\nin 568 over a pint I get cracking staright\naway: if he is a founding member, how\nis he still here?\n\u201cThe handball club was founded in\n2007-08, in my first year. Having been\ninto handball since I was 10, I got in-volved, and was on the committee that\nyear! I have been heavily involved in\nthe club ever since.\u201d I turn to Annabelle, asking how she got into handball,\nand expecting an answer similar to Stefan\u2019s. I\u2019m in for a surprise: \u201cit was actually an article written in Felix by Stefan\nin my first year that made me want to\nsign up for it!\u201d She explains further:\n\u201cStefan had done an article just before\nchristmas, and I thought that handball\nsounded like a cool thing to try out...a\nyear later, and here I am.\u201d I can\u2019t help\nbut smile at this: as Sport editor, this is\nthe kind of story that makes it all worth-while.\nI ask Stefan how he has seen the club\nevolve since its inception. He knows\nits history on his fingertips. \u201cIn the\nfirst couple of years, we played mainly\nfriendlies with a mixed team, and had\na men\u2019s team compete in the universities tournament organised by England\nHandball (EH). The following year we\njoined up with a First Division team,\nRuislip. We have an arrangement with\nthem to share facilities, training sessions and coaches. At the moment,\nthree of our members play with them in\nthe top flight of english handball. The\nwomen\u2019s team was set up last year, and\nthis year they play in the EH development league, as do the men.\u201d But this\nmeans that Annabelle is the first ever\nwomen\u2019s captain? \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d she\nrbeams. \u201cFirst captain ever.\u201d There it is,\npeople, a piece of history in the mak-ing: the first ever interview with the first\never women\u2019s handball captain. How\nhas their season been so far? \u201c We\u2019ve\nactually won two matches so far, which\nis pretty decent for a nascent team...\nWe notably beat Oxford by 5 goals this\nyear, having lost to them quite heavily\nlast year, so that\u2019s a notable improvement\u201d.\nWhat about the men\u2019s teams? Stefan\ntakes the question. \u201cThere is always a\ncore of strong European and Scandinavian students, many doing one-year\nmasters, who make up most of our first\nteam, and who train and play with Ruislip. The Eagles are currently top of the\nEH first division, and the Imperial team\nis third in the development league.\u201d\nHaving people play for the top team in\nthe league is pretty impressive, I think.\nHow often do they train?\n\u201cThere is one session at Ethos every\nweek\u201d, continues Stefan, and we can\nalways train at Ruislip another three\ntimes a week. Four times is a bit much,\nthough! I usually train about two to\nthree times a week.\u201d Annabelle con-curs, and says a bit more about the Imperial sessions: \u201c The guys and the girls\ntrain together, we always end up with\na match and a drink afterwards at the\nunion, so there\u2019s a very social side to\nthe club.\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject, I ask if\n(despite the small size of the club) they\ngo on any tours or trips together. As a\nmatter of fact, there is a handball tradi-tion: a tournament every year organised\nby the french school Centrale Lyon. \u201cIt\ninvolves most of the French unis, and\nit\u2019s held for a lot of different sports, not\njust handball, every year\u201d says Stefan.\n\u201cWe got into it the club\u2019s first year because a guy here had studied there pre-viously, and had an amazing time. It\u2019s\nbecome a handball ritual, where every\nmarch we will go down to Lyon by any\nmeans possible to eat, drink and play\nhandball!\u201d\nWhat about results? Or is it just for\nfun?\n\u201cWe\u2019ve acually done better every\nyear... Last year, the girls made the kno-cout stages in our first year there \u2013 but\nthe guys didn\u2019t\u201d says Annabelle. \u201cIt was\npretty satisfying.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big competition, amd the level\nis prettty high, given that it\u2019s in France\u201d\nStefan counters. \u201cThis year, we\u2019re sending a full girl\u2019s team and two men\u2019s\nteams, and hopefully the guys can make\nthe semis\u201d.\nWith the Olympics just around the\ncorner a major event in the handballing\nworld, what do they think of the state\nof handball in England at the moment?\nStefan smiles at the mention of the\nOlympics: \u201c I\u2019m actually volunteering for the handball event, I should be\nhelping out with some of the teams\nthis summer. I was supposed to assist\nthe German team, but in the end they\ndidn\u2019t qualify! Handball is growing\nhere, though, and England Handball\nis really pushing for the development\nof the sport.\u201d Annabelle agrees: \u201cYou\nsee it more and more in schools now,\nwhereas when I was in school the only\nsport I remember doing seriously was\nnetball. The Olympics will help it too,\nwith a number of handball venues being\nleft as part of the legacy\u201d\nStefan concludes by hoping that more\nhome-grown players will mean more\nuniversity participation. \u201cAs the club\ngrows, we can hopefully improve and\nget the Imperial teams up into the first\ndivision\u201d.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 03 february 2012 17\n\u201d\nS\nustainability is a hot topic.\nYet despite all the recent\nconventions and talks on\nsustainability, it\u2019s still\nhard to know what living\nsustainably really means.\nSo this year I am conducting my\nown sustainability experiment. I am\ncalling it \u201812 Sustainable Months of\n2012\u2019, and my mission is to find out\nhow sustainable living can realistically be achieved. Every month of 2012 I\nwill be trying a different (supposedly)\nsustainable lifestyle habit. E.g. I\u2019ll be\ntrying one month of \u2018no plastic bags\u2019,\none month of \u2018zero waste\u2019, one month\nof \u2018sustainable travel\u2019\u2026 you get the\nidea.\nThis January, I decided to become\na weekday vegetarian. This means\nnot eating any meat on weekdays.\nThe idea is that, for those who shudder at the thought of becoming an actual vegetarian, and find the thought\nof saying \u201cthis is my last ever KFC\u201d\nincomprehensible, this is a more sustainable yet less brutal alternative.\n(See Graham Hill\u2019s TED talk \u201cWhy\nI\u2019m a weekday vegetarian\u201d.)\nOn the scale of \u201cI only eat plants\u201d\nto \u201cI eat a steak for breakfast\u201d, I fall\nsomewhere in the middle. I thought\nthat becoming a vegetarian for just\nfive days a week for one month would\nbe super easy. However, it has not all\nbeen plain sailing.\nI have found that there are two reasons why being vegetarian is not as\neasy as expected: 1. Vegetarian options are pretty limited. 2. Meat tastes\nway better than vegetarian foods.\nThe first is, I think, the main diffi-culty. There is a severe lack of vegetarian food available. For starters, the\nBecome a vegetarian, save the world!\nlibrary caf\u00e9 provides just two different\nvegetarian baguettes, both of which\nare cheese, both of which sell out by\nabout 1pm. Poor form. In addition to\nthis, whilst attending college events\nthroughout January, I have turned\ndown free chicken kebabs, smoked\nsalmon sandwiches and sushi in favour of egg and cheese sandwiches,\nwhich is just not cool. This is not to\nmention experiences outside of col-lege, including going to Nando\u2019s and\nnot ordering chicken, and saying no\nto bacon sandwiches cooked by my\nhousemate one morning. All in all, it\nis pretty inconvenient to be vegetar-ian.\nLack of choice aside, the other main\nissue is that vegetarian options just\ndon\u2019t taste as good as the meat op-tions. Is there really a meat eater out\nthere who would choose a cheddar\nand tomato baguette over a chicken\nand bacon one (especially when they\nare exactly the same price)? I highly\ndoubt it. On asking one of the biggest\nmeat lovers I know, Eugene Wong,\nabout how he\u2019d feel about giving up\nmeat for five days a week, he said:\n\u201cWhich sane individual would inflict\nthat sort of grave injustice on a fellow\nhuman being?\u201d Need I say more?\nThe main point to consider in this\ndiscussion, however, is this: if everyone stopped eating meat, would it actually make a significant difference?\nBased on a moderately active person\nwith a weight of 65kg who consumes\nabout 2600 calories per day, it is estimated that a vegetarian has a footprint\nof 5.5kWh per day and a carnivore has\na footprint of 12kWh per day. This\nmeans vegetarians have less than half\nthe footprint of carnivores. Although a\nnumber of other factors would need to\nbe considered, such as where the animals live, what they eat and so on; the\npoint is that with over 7 billion people\non the planet, the energy saved if everyone were to become a vegetarian\nwould be significant.\nSo, there is a real case for eating less\nmeat. But is there a real solution? If\na \u2018moderate meat eater\u2019 like myself\nfound it fairly challenging to give up\nmeat five days out of seven for one\nmonth, where does that leave the real\nmeat lovers of this world? Sadly, I am\nnot sure that global abstinence from\nmeat is really a realistic solution. But\nis there another option?\nThis weekend, The Guardian published an article entitled \u201cCould lab-grown meat soon be the solution to\nI am not sure\nthat global\nabstinence from\nmeat is really a\nrealistic solution.\nBut is there\nanother option?\nthe world\u2019s food crisis?\u201d The author\nargues that not only could lab grown\nmeat reduce the environmental impact associated with animal rearing,\nit could be engineered to have less\nfat and also prevent animal-borne\ndiseases. I am not convinced that eating meat grown in a lab is really that\nappealing. However, if farming meat\nfor over 7 billion people is unsustain-able, yet we are not ready to end our\nlove affair with meat, perhaps a more\nradical solution such as this should be\nseriously considered.\nI\u2019ll be blogging about my \u201c12 Sustainable Months of 2012\u201d on: http://caro-linesarahwood.posterous.com and\nalso tweeting about my experiences on\ntwitter: carosarahwood@twitter.com\nMaybe Morrissey\u2019s mum and dad thought the whole vegetarian thing was\njust a phase he would grow out of. Turns out, maybe it\u2019s not\nI am no\nI am n\nthat glo\nthat glo\nCaroline Wood\nAwkward conversations\nN\now I\u2019m not really one\nto feel self-conscious.\nIf we\u2019re being brutally\nhonest here, I actually\nquite like getting attention \u2013 a hangover from my Mum never\nlooking at how high I was going. Recent experience, however, has taught\nme that I have boundaries \u2013 lines that\nshould not, under any circumstances, be\ncrossed.\nYou often hear folk whinging these\ndays (folk never used to grumble in the\ngood ol\u2019 days, you see) that London is\nan anti-social place. Nobody speaks to\nyou on the tube, you can never catch\nthat attractive person\u2019s eye and not\none person has EVER asked you what\nyou\u2019re writing on your MacBook Pro in\nStarbucks.\nWhy is it then that all the social bees\nseem to congregate at public swimming\npools? Swimming is not a social sport.\nYou spend the majority of your time\nburying your head under water as if\nyou\u2019re frantically training for the Somerset under-23 county apple-bobbing\nchampionships. This is not the kind of\npastime that you\u2019d imagine would appeal to the chatterboxes.\nBut it does. Oh, how it does. In normal life, someone\u2019s willy flopping\naround in the breeze would be cause\nfor looking away in embarrassment, or\nperhaps letting out a little snigger. But\nnot in the public baths\u2019changing rooms.\nSuch a sight is an open invitation for\nchatting about the weather, or asking what you bought your mother for\nChristmas. Why?! You wouldn\u2019t speak\nto me clothed \u2013 why speak to me with\nsuch gusto now that the crown jewels\nare available for viewing?!\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop at the changing\nroom doors. Never has the expression\n\u201cdo you come here often?\u201d been so utterly misused as during stilted chats in\nthe shallow end. The correct use of that\nphrase should have it dripping in irony.\nIt is NOT correct when both parties are\ndripping wet and literally dressed in\nspeedos.\nBoys have it easy though. Several\ntimes my other half has come home\nfrom her swim to tell me that other\nmembers of the fairer sex have quizzed\nher on personal gardening techniques\nand habits. How you squirm out of that\none I have no idea. Answers on a postcard please.\nThis is one of those rare instances\nwhen life would be so much better\nif people weren\u2019t quite so keen to be\nfriendly.

This\napparently made the Society\u2019s web-page\nan \u201cunwelcoming\u201d place for Muslim stu-dents. Who\u2019d a thunk? I\u2019d probably feel\nunwelcome walking into an Islam Soc or\nChristian Union meeting or discussion,\neven if people were being completely\ncool about it. There\u2019s just something\nabout walking into a discussion group,\nboth online and offline, for people with\nviews you don\u2019t agree with that makes\npeople relatively uncomfortable.\nReligion, to many people, is a highly\npersonal and spiritual thing \u2013 I get that,\nbut people also seem to believe that religion should get a special status and that\nit shouldn\u2019t be subject to the normal criticism that is often applied to everything\nGive TfLa break\nThe right to offend\nelse. I am a (wavering) Lib Dem, and\nI get shit about it all the time \u2013 I don\u2019t\nsee why religion should receive a special status that should protect it from all\nsorts of criticism that pretty much every\nother sort of deeply held view, whether\non politics, economics, music or Tube\nTrains (how the fuck can you like the\nNorthern Line?) will receive.\nLook, I am not going to pretend that I\nhave a good enough understanding of Islamic/Christian/Jewish/Hindu/Pastafar-ian Scripture to have a proper theological\ndebate, but I\u2019ve read around the subject\nenough to have a sensible and reasoned\nview of the various religions. If I take a\nquote out of context, or misunderstand\nthe point of the text \u2013 then fine, feel free\nto correct me \u2013 but don\u2019t tell me that I\nhave no right whatsoever to criticize\nthe various aspects of your religion. I\u2019m\npretty sure most Christians are happy\nenough criticizing Islam (or Mormons),\nand most Muslims are happy to criticize\nChristianity \u2013 only when their own religion is under a spotlight do people really\nget touchy.\nI\u2019d bet most people don\u2019t follow all the\nrules in the book anyway \u2013 mainstream\nChristianity and Judaism have left the\nworst bits of the Old Testament well behind them, and nobody really follows the\nKoran word for word, do they?\nInstead of crying foul and trying to\nstifle their critics through censorship or\nintimidation, religious groups should\nattempt to face up to their criticism and\nrespond appropriately. Yes, sometimes\npeople make jokes that could be considered insulting or in bad taste, but this is\nan important part of freedom of speech;\ncartoons are a perfectly legitimate way\nof expressing your views \u2013 they may not\nbe as sophisticated or as eloquent as an\nacademic paper or a non-fiction book,\nbut the artist still has a right to express\nhis views.\nA\nh sorry I\u2019m late, fucking\nTransport for London\u201d\n\u2013 the familiar refrain\nuttered by thousands of\nLondoners every day. I\nmean it was obviously a failure of the\nbastards that you couldn\u2019t make it to\ndrinks/lectures/sessions of parliament\non time. Right?\nWRONG. I say we all take a look\nat ourselves. Was it really the bus that\nmade you late, or was it something to\ndo with the fact you were in pyjamas,\nstuffing yourself with so much Special\nK it lost any scarce ability it once had to\nkeep your figure trim five minutes before you were supposed to leave?\nYes, TfL isn\u2019t perfect. Sure, the buses\nsometimes stop their journeys half way\nthrough without explanation. And yes,\nthe Circle and/or District line is guaranteed to be mysteriously closed every weekend (for the addition of new\ntrains \u2013 I\u2019m having none of it). But\ntake a moment, think back to whatever\ndark hole Imperial did you the service\nof dragging you out of and try to recall\nthe state of the public transport. If your\nexperience was anything like mine, repressed memories of irregular services,\nlong waits, suspiciously expensive tickets and the complete inability to travel\nbetween 11pm and 6:30am should hor-rifyingly resurface.\nNot to mention that nights out at\nhome usually entail more coercion, bargaining and bribery than the allocation\nof a World Cup as you attempt to negotiate a deal whereby you can get to and\nfrom the location and have somewhere\nto sleep. Since being in London, I\u2019ve\nnot thought once about how I\u2019m going\nto get home \u2013 there\u2019ll always be a night\nbus.\nThe Londoners amongst you are\nprobably now itching to tell me of important defects I\u2019ve missed, maybe the\nfact that the buses rarely arrive when\nscheduled. Whilst this is true, to those\nnaysayers I can only suggest one thing:\ngo somewhere that is not London, then\nFreedom of Speech is perhaps the most\nimportant aspect of our modern democracy \u2013 the ability to express our doubts,\nconcerns and criticism of current events\nis what differentiates the success of the\nDemocratic World from Dictatorships.\nYes, we complain about policing policy,\nor about the UK\u2019s foreign policy \u2013 but\nit\u2019s the fact that we can actually complain\nor take action that means that we have\nthe ability to cause change and to drive\nand motivate people to do something\nabout the problem.\nOf course, we find a lot of things people say unacceptable and reprehensible\n\u2013 I find a lot of things that the BNP have\nto say reprehensible, and I most certainly\ndon\u2019t agree with the views of Christian\nor Muslim Fundamentalists on gay marriage \u2013 I even find them (as a straight\nperson) slightly offensive, because it implies that having different views on sexuality is weird, or abnormal in some way.\nI find suggestions that atheists are immoral materialists even more offensive,\nyet you don\u2019t find me running to Scott\nHeath\u2019s office to demand an apology\nfrom the offending society. An important\npart of being able to criticize others is the\nwillingness to accept criticism yourself,\nrather than living in a rose-tinted world\ncatch a bus. Unless you\u2019re luckier than\na lottery winner who\u2019s just eaten a good\nsandwich from Tesco, you\u2019ll find that\nthe buses rarely keep to schedule, and\naren\u2019t regular enough to compensate for\nthis fact.\nNext time you start blaming your tardiness on the transport system, stop. Reconsider what you\u2019re about to say and\njust think. London is a huge city and yet\nthe buses and tubes are regular, inexpensive and actually, dare I say it, fairly\nquick. So yes, TfL may have cheekily\nraised their prices by 5p over the New\nYear (nothing gets past me) and yes, at\ntimes they can be extremely frustrating.\nBut come on guys, give TfL a break.\nwhere everything is going \u201cjust right\u201d.\nTo censor anything that could be even\nremotely offensive, even to a small minority of students, is a dangerous prec-edent. It could be used as a tool to stifle\nlegitimate debate and to force people to\napologize and back down. It is, however,\nimportant to differentiate between restrictions on offensive speech and speech\nthat would cause actual harm \u2013 nobody\n(except a crazy Ron Paul Libertarian\nwho believes solely in rights and not in\nresponsibilities) would say a person has\na right to yell \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded theatre.\nAnd one last thing \u2013 every other large\nuniversity in London has an Atheist,\nAgnostic and Humanist Soicety, while\nImperial\u2019s Atheists and Agnostics Society shut down 2 years ago. It\u2019s high time\nthat, in a time where many government\npolicies are increasingly influenced by\nreligious fundamentalists (Nadine Dorries\u2019 repeated attempts to trash school\nsex education classes, and to outlaw\nabortion comes to mind), and with the\nincreasingly vocal religious societies inviting controversial speakers to the College, that there should be a voice of nonbelief and reason in the college. I mean,\neven King\u2019s has one, and, as a Medic, if\nGKT has something, we need one at IC!\nLaurence de\nLussy Kubisa\nYes, sometimes\npeople make jokes\nthat could be\nconsidered insulting\nor in bad taste, but\nthis is an important\npart of freedom of\nspeech\n\u201c\nYes, so\nYes, so\npeople\npeople\n\u201d\ndom of\ndom of\nYep, he may offend people, but consider this: without him, no Karl Pilkington\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 03 February 2012 9\nL\nate last year, the environment secretary\nCaroline Spellman announced that badger\nculling would go ahead\nin 2012 in an effort to combat bovine\ntuberculosis (TB). Now that the locations of pilot culls have been named,\nthe scheme is suddenly becoming a\nreality, but is the cull justified and\nwill it be effective?\nBadgers are one of Britain\u2019s most\nenigmatic mammals due to their\nnocturnal nature, and are usually\nonly seen either wombling across a\nroad late at night or more likely, as\nroad-kill. Traffic will be the least\nof the worries of badgers in parts of\nGloucestershire and Somerset how-ever, as these are the areas in which\npilot culls will be implemented.\nCulling badgers is not a new phe-nomenon, with extermination efforts\ntaking place on and off throughout\nthe latter half of the twentieth cen-tury, and although the emphasis here\nis on \u2018pilot\u2019, there is the potential for\nmore widespread action across the\nrest of the UK.\nThe cull is objectionable for two\nkey reasons. On a deontological\nlevel, the cull represents humanity\u2019s\ntendency for species-chauvinism.\nEnvironmental, and admittedly con-servation, issues are often driven by\nthe logic that humans are more important than, and have the authority\nto remove other species should they\npose a threat. Which would be valid\nand defensible if the species in question was threatening human lives, for\ninstance I\u2019m sure less people would\nbe opposed to eradicating the species of mosquito that carries malaria.\nThe threat badgers pose however,\nis only to our cows, a non-essential\nelement of human life, despite what\nsome might claim, and so the organised killing of them for our benefit is\nunjustified.\nUnfortunately in itself, this moral\nargument does not stand, as by the\nsame reasoning I should be advocating vegetarianism \u2013 which I am not.\nA more convincing argument comes\nin the form of the scientific justifica-Badgering the badgers\ntion for the cull, or lack thereof, in\nthat there is evidence that a cull may\nactually increase the spread of bovine\nTB rather than stem it. Amongst others this view is supported by Rosie\nWoodroffe, a senior research fellow\nat the Zoological Society of London,\nand her research. It was found that although a cull may marginally reduce\nthe incidence of cattle TB in the focal\narea, badgers are likely to disperse as\nresult of the disruption, and the areas in the vicinity could suffer an increased incidence of TB as a result.\nDespite these anti-cull arguments,\nit is presumably still favoured by the\nGovernment because of the potential\nshort term reduction in bovine tuberculosis a cull could bring. It is easy\nto see the appeal when it is estimated\nthat roughly one billion pounds of\nthe taxpayer\u2019s money could be spent\nover the next ten years tackling the\nproblem.\nThis would hold if it wasn\u2019t for the\nmethod of cull chosen. To decrease\nthe incidence of TB in cattle by a\nnotable amount, an efficient method\nChristopher Nichols on why we should save the badgers from culling\nDon\u2019t kill them... I\u2019ll take them. I\u2019ll take them all!\nsuch as gassing must be used. Not,\nas the government has seen fit, the\n\u2018farmers and their guns\u2019 technique.\nWhilst this may serve to appease\nangry farmers with a grudge against\nbadgers, I doubt the random shooting\nof badgers will actually have a significant impact on a population.\nA preferred alternative to culling\nis vaccination, a method which has\nhad some success in captive badgers.\nStudies are currently underway into\nits applicability in wild populations.\nThis however is of no consolation\nto the badgers who will be culled in\nthe coming year or the animal groups\nthat are opposed to the cull. The only\nsaving grace is that with any luck\nbadgers will avoid being shot by exploiting a trait of theirs that the powers that be seem to have overlooked.\nSurely shooting nocturnal badgers in\nthe dark is hardly going to yield fantastic results. The deaths of any that\nare unlucky enough to meet a gun-slinging farmer in the coming nights\ncan be put down to little more than\nmyopic mustelid murder.\nOddities of\nPhysics\nArriana Sorba\nThe SAF main lecture theatre was\nfull to bursting last Wednesday eve-ning, as Simon Foster and his troupe\nof postgraduate students put on an\nexciting and informative show on\n\u2018The Oddities of Physics\u2019. Guests\nwere welcomed into the building\nwith a display by the Imperial College Juggling Society, intrigued and\nunaware that a more fiery take on the\ndisplay was on its way later in the\nlecture, to help explain special rela-tivity...\nUsing balls of fire to help illustrate\na light clock wasn\u2019t the only exciting\ndemonstration that had the audience\ngasping with awe, though. From resonating jelly to a levitating magnet,\nthe sense of wonderment caused by\neach demonstration was palpable,\nnot least from the groups of school\nchildren that the Friends of Imperial College had invited to the event.\nOne postgraduate encouraged the\naudience to \u2018fear the air around us\u2019,\nwith a startling and somewhat dangerous video he\u2019d made, on Imperial\nsoil, of an oil drum collapsing under\natmospheric pressure, whilst Simon\nhimself got the audience murmuring with curiosity simply by putting\na heat-tech t-shirt in the microwave.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all action, and the\naudience were equally enthused\nby the pithy explanations of other\nmore subtle physical phenomena. Be\nthey the time reversal symmetry of\nthe movement of bacteria, Fourier\ntransforms, or the mysterious quantum effects surrounding Planck\u2019s\nconstant, each thought-provoking\nquestion that was posed, (for who\nhasn\u2019t at some point wondered what\nthe world would look like if \u0127 wasn\u2019t\nso small?), was matched in intrigue\nby its fascinating physical answer.\nPhysics current sexiest topic, the\nHiggs Boson and the Large Hadron\nCollider, also got its due airtime, as\ndid a simple but enlightening explanation of the Aurora Borealis, using\nthe infamous, imposing-looking Van\nde Graaff generator.\nThe lecture was hosted by the\nFriends of Imperial College, an organisation dedicated to providing\nopportunities for the wider community to get involved in and learn\nmore about any field of science,\ntechnology and medicine. It does this\nthrough the Imperial College network of staff, students and alumni,\nholding a variety of events throughout the year, from lectures to socials,\nkeeping the public informed of and\ninterested in the latest scientific ad-vances. It also generously supports\nthe Imperial College Student Opportunities Fund.\nJohn Connor Press Associates\n\n"

Success breeds expectation,\nwhich translates into pressure \u2013 exactly the sort of thing you don\u2019t\nwant when you\u2019re trying to reproduce\npast exploits.\nOn the weekend of the 20th of January,\nthe Imperial men\u2019s and women\u2019s team\ntook all this in their stride while attempting to defend their Southern Premiership\ncrowns, and come top of the league for\nthe second year running.\nThe women were on a string of vic-tories, as yet unbeaten this season. The\nfirst premiership tournament weekend,\nwhich saw all the home matches of the\nseason played in one go, ended with IC\nladies on top and raring for more.For\ncaptain Charlotte Levin and her team,\nit should have been plain sailing \u2013 and\nfor the most part, it was. Beginning the\nweekend by fencing foil and sabre on\nthe saturday, the girls breezed through;\nthoroughly destroying Queen Mary and\nwinning convincingly against Oxford,\nCambridge and UCL. The day ended\nwith the girls having assured victory in\none match (before having fenced the\nepee) and needing an easily-achievable\namount of points to win the others.\nThings were looking up, and it all almost\nseemed too easy.\nThe men\u2019s team, however, was having a rather more trying time of it. Their\nfirst match against Cambridge got off\nto a good start, with a (somewhat ex-pected) win in the sabre, putting the rest\nof the team at ease. The foil continued\nin this vein, beating their opponents by\nmore than ten hits (where they had lost\non the previous occasion). It fell to the\nepeeists to finalise the victory, which\nthey did in style. Final score: 120-108.\nA first win soothed the men\u2019s nerves,\nwhich was necessary for the match to\ncome: a showdown with the league leaders Oxford. Having drawn, and lost on\nweapons, to the Dark Blues at the previous premiership weekend, the guys\nhad a bone to pick with the Oxford\nteam. Unfortunately, the schedule meant\nthat Imperial had a long break between\nmatches, and this had them feeling quite\nlethargic when the time came to take up\narms again.\nThe match got underway with sabre,\nas before, and the sabreurs did not dis-appoint, pulling off a resoundingg victory to leave Imperial twenty-nine points\nclear. The foil was more of an uphill\nstruggle, with both good and bad performances from the team. In the end, they\nCharlotte Levin\n...Continued on Page 45\n\n"

The Oscar race for Best Actress\nbecomes tighter than ever when Viola Davis and\nMeryl Streep (The Iron Lady) go head-to-head.\nStreep has already won the Golden Globe and is\nthe favourite to win the BAFTA, but the Oscars\nare a real coin-toss. A large majority of AMPAS\nmembers, the governing body voting for who wins\nthe prestigious Academy Award, is made up of\nthe Screen Actors Guild, and the fact that Davis\nmanaged to sway her peers in her direction is a\ngood sign. Some argue it is about time for Streep\nto finally win her third long overdue Oscar, whilst\nDavis\u2019 supporters brand Streep\u2019s performance as\nnothing but classy mimicry and the unsubstantial critical acclaim towards her latest Margaret\nThatcher biopic will not steer the odds in favour\nof Streep. Across the board, there is nothing surprising about Plummer finally being shown some\naward love after his lengthy career, and Dujardin\ncontinues to dominate with his role in The Artist.\nThe English Patient, winner of nine Oscars, is\nthe story of a man, played by Ralph Fiennes,\nwho is found badly burnt and suffering from\nmemory loss in the wreckage of a plane in the\nNorth African desert in World War Two. As\nhe is cared for by an army nurse, his memory\nslowly returns and is shown to us in a series of\nflashbacks. The unveiling of his past reveals a\nstory of a love affair.\nAnthony Minghella won an Oscar for his\ndirection of this film, and rightly so.

But no editorial challenge that faces us, here in the\nFelix office, comes anywhere close\nto the mammoth task taken on by the\nBritish Museum (or, more truthfully,\nby curator Venetia Porter) in its latest\nexhibition, Hajj: Journey to the Heart\nof Islam.\nSuitably housed under the domed\nroof of the Reading Room, the British Museum presents an exploration\nof the history, culture and experience\nof the fabled Muslim pilgrimage, Hajj,\nthe first recorded exhibition of its kind.\nIt comes as part of the museum\u2019s study\ninto faith and society: first Book of\nthe Dead in 2010, then Treasures of\nHeaven last year, analysed the impact\nof religious belief on the cultures of\nAncient Egypt and Medieval Europe\nrespectively. But Hajj is quite a different matter entirely.\nWe\u2019ve all wandered the corridors of\nmuseums and peered at little bits of\nhistory, each originating from a time\nquite alien to our own. With Hajj how\u201cAn eclectic mix of\nmodern art, antique\nrelics and personal\naccounts.\u201d\nelling from Timbuktu in 1324, to the\nearly package tours runs by Thomas\nCook in the 1800\u2019s. Early on, we are\nconfronted by the majestic crimson\nred mahmal - a ceremonial palanquin,\ncomplete with pennants, embroidered\nwith floral patterns and Quranic verses\nin a velvety black and gold \u2013 in which\nQu\u2019rans were transported along the\nway to Mecca. Yet, despite a varied selection of maps, antique Qur\u2019ans and\nphotographs, along with the occasional\nastrolabe, the collection of items on\ndisplay feels quite sparse. (It\u2019s interesting to note that may be due in part\nto the Islamic disapproval of material-ism. Broadly speaking, its not in their\nnature to cherish the kind of items\nthat now make up most of your average museum\u2019s collections, something\nbemoaned by Shenaz Khemali in her\nrecent article in The Guardian.)\nBut it wasn\u2019t so much the heritage\nthat I really wanted from Hajj, but\nrather a greater insight into the wonderment of the spiritual experience.\nSurely journeying to the heart of Islam\nhinges on understanding what individually drove just shy of three million Muslims to pilgrimage last year?\nI doubt it was an antique carpet. But\nherein lies that challenge taken up by\nVenetia Porter and co. How do you distil down this simultaneously spiritual\nand physical spectacle and present it in\nthe form of a museum exhibition, to an\naudience, the vast majority of whom\nwill never set foot in the holy city of\nMecca?\nThe exhibition suffered at times from\nresembling a three-dimensional text-book, just presenting facts and items\nin the uninspiring tone of a GCSE\nreligious studies teacher. However it\nwas the personal accounts that, for this\nreviewer, most successfully revealed\nthat understanding of the wonderment\nof Hajj. Most touching of all, was the\nscrapbook account of a ten year old\nBritish Muslim girl, recording her account of her Hajj experience, written\nup in neat hand-writing in the kind of\nexercise book that is familiar to any\nstudent. Ahmed Mater\u2019s Magnetism\nequally sticks in the mind, representing\nHajj, through a Ka\u2019aba-shaped magnet\nwith a crowd of iron filings, all circling\nin unison. Maybe it was the physicist\nin me, but the comparison of Islam\nto an all-pervading, all-uniting field,\nstruck me as more thought-provoking\nthat any of the antiques on display.\nHajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam\nis a valiant endeavour to wrestle with\nsomething so visible, yet so impen-etrable. For those who know little of\nIslam, Hajj gives a thorough account\nthat touches, if only briefly, on almost\nevery shade of the world-wide Muslim\ncommunity.

After an end-to-end\nfirst few minutes, IC soon asserted their\nauthority and quickly raced to a 5-0\nlead.\nDespite a sublime goal from the very\nedge of the D by LSE\u2019s Goal Shooter,\nImperial\u2019s spirit was undiminished and\n5 further goals closed the quarter at 10-1. Imperial continued their dominating streak in the second quarter with\nshooters Piening and Bachelor showing\ndeadly accuracy in front of goal. LSE\ntried to find an opening but were unable to break the fluidity of IC\u2019s play.\nWith stylish passing that wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen out of place at The Nou Camp, the\nNetball 3s crush LSE; plucky 4s lose to St George\u2019s\nhome side were sitting comfortably at\nhalf time, leading 23-1.\nTo their credit, LSE continued to battle on after the break and were rewarded\nwith a few second half goals, although\nit did little to close the sizeable gap. Despite their best attempts to salvage the\ngame, the IC shooters were always able\nto find an extra half yard when it mat-tered, resulting in a well-deserved 39-5\nvictory for Imperial.\nUnfortunately Imperial 4s didn\u2019t\nenjoy similar success in their match\nagainst St. George\u2019s 4s. There were few\nchances to steal in the early stages of\nthe game, with the ball stuck in the centre of court for much of the first quarter.\nAt the first break the score line was low;\njust 3-3, a testament to the disciplined,\nresilient play by both sides. Archer\u2019s\nimpressive interceptions won her player of the match and the first half closed\nwith both sides very much still in the\ngame. But it was in the second half that\nSt George\u2019s pulled away; most of the\naway goals were scored in the fourth\nquarter and the final scoreboard read\n22-8 to St Georges; by no means an accurate reflection of the game.\nNetball\nFeroza Kassam\nWomen\u2019s 3s 39\nLSE 4s 5\nWomen\u2019s 4s 8\nSt George\u2019s 4s 22\nNetball.

The epeeists made excruciatingly slow progress, but the hits built\nup, bit by bit.

They achieved this\ncomfortably, and while they did not win\ntheir match, the overall score ended up\nas 125-99 to Imperial. With only ULU,\nthe weakest team in the league, to go, the\nmen were confident they could seal their\nleague win.

    "content": "POLITICS\nMP David Lammy has blamed anti-smacking\nlaws for the lack of discipline that led to riots in\nLondon last summer.\nMr Lammy is the MP for the North London constituency of Tottenham, where the riots originated and some of the worst violence\nwas experienced. He became a regular on our\nscreens for his vocal and often radical views\nof the riots. The Labour MP attacked the 2004\nChildren\u2019s Act as being a middle-class \u201cliberal\nelite\u201d law that stigmatises the working class\nand leaves them too scared to discipline their\nchildren.\nThe current legislation allows for the smacking of children as long as it does not cause\n\u201creddening of the skin\u201d. Other methods of discipline which cause physical or serious mental\nharm are also banned. The concern is not so\nmuch that the law itself is wrong in its intentions and the limitations it sets, but in its subjective interpretation.\nMr Lammy has argued that the law has too\nmuch of a grey area, leaving parents fearing\nthat their children could be taken away by\nsocial workers if they hit them at all. He also\nmade it clear that there is a class divide where\nparents in deprived areas are constantly being\nvisited by social workers regardless of whether\nthere is reason, leading to constant fear. Middle-classes, on the other hand, are rarely targeted by social workers and can train discipline\ninto their children with \u201cprivate education and\nextra-curricular activities.\u201d\nDespite these claims of a class difference, the\nlaw was actually brought in by Lammy\u2019s own\ntraditionally working class Labour party, but he\nhas quickly gained the support of traditionally\nmiddle class Conservative politicians, including Education Secretary Michael Gove and\nMayor of London Boris Johnson who find the\nlaw \u201cconfusing\u201d.\nAn overhaul of the law could well have wide-Smack your kids up\nHow red is too red?\nWhy not write for Felix\nPolitics?

A poll by the Guardian,\ngenerally thought to have a readership that\nepitomises the \u201cliberal elite\u201d, showed that last\nOctober two-thirds of its readers opposed a\nsmacking ban. At the time of writing, 90% of\nTelegraph readers, thought to epitomise middle\nclass conservative attitudes, support the right to\nsmack.\nIt now appears likely that a serious review\nwill take place of the law and it is likely to be\nchanged due to this vocal backbench MP.\nFELIX\nFriday 03 February 2012\n12\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\nThe Annual 5 day World Economic Forum meeting\nin Davos, Switzerland ended on Sunday in an unusually sombre mood. It\u2019s usually a rather positive\naffair, for capitalists at least, where world leaders\nrub shoulders with multi-billionaires and heads of\nNGOs or large corporations can openly lobby for a\nbetter world or better profits while dining with Hollywood\u2019s A-list. This year, however, was rather de-pressing. Global economic problems, as with the\nlast few years, were top of the agenda. But this\ntime, few people had any grand plans to turn the\nbust into a boom. Instead, the focus was on damage control \u2013 particularly how to control the Eurozone crisis. This was coupled with an admission\nthat world growth would have to be driven by, and\ncompletely depend on, Asia \u2013 although even China\nwould no longer experience double-digit growth.\nBusiness Leaders expressed concern that rising youth unemployment across the globe was a\n\u201cticking time bomb.\u201d Usually, a young population\nmeans a low dependency ratio and gives developing countries the capacity to create high growth\nand fuel global economic stability. Instead, unemployment is rising, particularly in the Arab World,\nwhere it is partly responsible for triggering the revolts last spring.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed a\nneed for greater integration in Europe, particularly\nin her financial institutions. Merkel argued that the\nEuropean Stability Mechanism, used for emergency bailouts in the Eurozone, ought to be increased.\nShe, however, made it clear that the more Germany is willing to pay out, the higher the moral\nhazard as other countries and private institutions\nfeel lower risk.\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, how-ever, criticised the German chancellor for not\ndoing enough, suggesting that the country was\nsomehow shirking its responsibility. Germany is\nEurope\u2019s largest economy, has provided larger\nbailouts than any other country, and defended\nBritain when French politicians were quick to attack Cameron\u2019s European policy. His views have\ncaused anger among pro-European MPs. Cameron\nhas already alienated French President Nicholas\nSarkozy and is accused of leaving Britain at the\nedge of Europe.\nChristine Lagarde, the new head of the International Monetary Fund and former minister in the\nFrench cabinet, has campaigned for a \u20ac500bn\nincrease in her institution\u2019s budget and largely\nagreed with Mrs Merkel\u2019s plan for greater European financial integration. She argued that the IMF\nwas a safer bet than any other for securing the\nEurozone.\nRajat Jain\nDavos 2012\nAll Doom & Gloom with no Boom\nRajat Jain\nMiddle class nanny-state blamed for riots\nPolice have been deployed in towns across\nSenegal, and are reported to have killed two\npeople in the northern town of Podor, as protests intensify. Rallies have been organised\nafter President Abdoulaye Wade declared his\nintention to stand for a third term.\nSenegal has long been seen as a relatively\nsuccessful democracy by African standards.\nMr Wade first came to power in 2000, breaking over fourty years of Socialist rule in the\nWest African country. He had generally been\nseen as a popular and effective president. In\n2001, under his rule, a new constitution was\nadopted limiting presidential terms to a maximum of two spanning five years each from the\nprevious seven year terms.\nHowever, more recently, views of him have\nsoured. He changed the constitution back so he\ncan stand for a third term, which would be seven years long. Increased control on freedom of\nthe press has been introduced and three opposition candidates (including a popular musician)\nhave been barred from standing.\nFurther to this, Wade has also been accused\nof corruption, despotism and wasting public\nmoney in the impoverished nation on vanity\nprojects.\nThere seems to be a growing risk that Wade\ncould turn Senegal into another story of failed\ndemocracy in Africa. However, with his unpopularity with the church and growing anger\namong the people, protests could well bring\ndown the president before the election on February 26.\nFresh protests in Senegal\nRajat Jain\nAbdoulaye Wade remains defiant\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nNeeson leads a lacklustre pack\nFELIX\nFriday 03 February 2012\n28\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nNow that is out of the way, Like Crazy\ngoes beyond dialogue, beyond the writ-ing, beyond any ordinary story, or as you\nmay have guessed, beyond a love story.\nIt isn\u2019t brilliantly poetic nor is it even\nmildly cheesy. To be honest, this movie\nhas one of the blandest storylines I have\never seen. This is perhaps why it didn\u2019t\nscore big with a lot of people.\nLong story short: Girl meets Boy. They\nfall in love. Girl is separated from Boy.\nIf you are looking for a load of mindless romance, this is not your cup of tea.\nThere is romance though, a good load\nof it, and then there is pain. What would\nstun you is that the love and pain keep\non interchanging so often that it would\ntransport you to somewhere in the mid-dle, where you might be able to figure\nout this film\u2019s artistic side, or you might\nswitch off and pass this movie off as a\nmess. Since we already know that the\nSundance Film Festival\u2019s judge\u2019s panel\nis what we would like to classify as \u2018the\nhippies amongst critics\u2019, it doesn\u2019t come\nas a surprise that this film captured all the\n\u201cI thought I understood it, that I could\ngrasp it, but I didn\u2019t, not really. Only the\nsmudgeness of it; the pink-slippered, all-containered, semi-precious eagerness\nof it. I didn\u2019t realize it would sometimes\nbe more than whole, that the wholeness\nwas a rather luxurious idea. Because it\u2019s\nthe halves that halve you in half. I didn\u2019t\nknow, don\u2019t know, about the in-between\nbits; the gory bits of you, and the gory\nbits of me.\u201d\nBefore actually writing this one, I\u2019d\nlike to clear out any of the false assump-tions. One: this is not a chick flick. Two:\nJust because it\u2019s won the top prize at the\nSundance Film Festival, it doesn\u2019t mean\nyou will like it; you might, in fact, hate it.\nLiam Neeson cements his status as action man of the moment \u2013 shame about the wolves\nattention.\nThe performances are outstanding.\nAnton Yelchin and Felicity Jones have\nto carry the burden of the entire movie\non their shoulders and I believe they do\na smash-up job. The silences, the looks,\nthe gentle touches, the expressions all\nmelt together perfectly. Of course you\nwon\u2019t notice it. I didn\u2019t. I was confused\nfor about an hour after seeing the film\nand my brain was fuzzy. What would\nstrike anyone is the reality of the movie.\nIt is too believable. The situations, the re-lationships, the characters portrayed are\ntoo real. I can\u2019t point out the exact reason\nbehind it: it could either be the writing,\nthe camera work, or something else. But\nit works.\nThis isn\u2019t like your regular review because I, the reviewer, haven\u2019t given you\nmy opinion. I liked it. I was able to appreciate how the whole package turned\nout. But that still isn\u2019t my opinion. I\nwon\u2019t give you one. You might like it or\nyou might not, as I said before. It is up\nfor you to decide.\nDirector Drake Doremus\nScreenwriters Drake Doremus, Ben\nYork Jones\nCast Felicity Jones, Anton Yelchin,\nJennifer Lawrence\nLike Crazy\nHitesh Shewakramani\nIf you ever leave me, I\u2019ll strangle you... like crazy...\nWanting, needing, loving, missing...\nDirector Joe Carnahan\nScreenwriters Joe Carnahan, Ian\nMacKenzie Jeffers\nCast Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo,\nDermot Mulroney, Dallas Roberts,\nJoe Anderson\nThe Grey\nAemun Reza\nIf you like dogs, don\u2019t watch this film.\nBased in Alaska, a typical plane crash\nresults in seven men surviving. Why do\nguys always survive plane crashes? The\nflight attendants never survive. Only\never men, and one of them is always\nblack. Even death doesn\u2019t racially dis-criminate.\nSo you\u2019re stranded in the middle of a\nsnowy plane wreck, faced with freezing\ntemperatures, no food, and no water and\nwhat is your worse fear? Wolves appar-ently. Because dogs are that scary.\nThere is barely any background story\nto Liam Neeson\u2019s character. He\u2019s just\nsome guy on a plane, who survives\nand apparently knows everything about\nwolves. How convenient.\nDespite playing an extremely dull\ncharacter, Liam Neeson can still pull off\na strong and powerful performance. As\nthe only credited headline actor, Neeson\nimmediately takes the lead role with his\nknowledge of how to survive in the wild.\nSurvival 101 and all that jazz. Out of the\nseven men who survive, he is the only\none who has a lasting presence and the\ndecent dialogue.\nBack to the story, or what\u2019s left of it,\nthe wolves start trying to kill the survi-vors. They don\u2019t even look like wolves,\nmore like dogs with rabies. The wolves\ndon\u2019t even want to eat them; they just\nwant to kill them. Don\u2019t really blame the\nwolves.\nBut kudos to the film, they did actually\nuse real wolves, not just the CGI stuff\nthat The Twilight Saga uses. But I would\nhave been more impressed if they had\nturned into werewolves.\nThe main plot is them fighting the\nwolves and trying to find some kind of\ncivilisation. Landing in the middle of nowhere means that it was mainly the characters walking through a scenic land-scape. This is nice and all, but I can see\nbetter stuff on my desktop background.\nThis film is mainly action, and not\nvery good action at that. The movie\ndoesn\u2019t have a plot and tries to be really\nemotionally when people die, but I just\nwasn\u2019t buying it. In the climax of the\nmovie, which was meant to be the most\nemotional part, I was bored. They had\nlonged it out beyond belief.\nYou\u2019d think that a film with Liam\nNeeson would be an amazing film and\nthat may be the main reason why you go\nsee it but it really isn\u2019t worth your time.\nEven if you do have two hours to waste,\nyou\u2019re better off watching paint dry. I don\u2019t know who you are. I don\u2019t know what you want... oh, don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m just waiting for Taken 2\n\n"

    "content": "and the dirty water can be used for\nother needs.\nIn previous years, Raincatcher\nteams\u2019 only purpose was to build water tanks but, this summer, our team\nintends to start a new program \u2013 the\n\u201cTraining of Trainers\u201d scheme, which\naims to educate people in Tabora and\nlocal rural areas about hygiene, sanitation and how to construct their own\ndomestic scale rainwater harvesting\nsystems. This will be a huge step towards sustainability as local people\nwill be able to provide for themselves\nand learn about the safety of water\nuse. As our last article pointed out,\nthis education is crucial \u2013 there is no\npoint having access to water if it is\nnot looked after, cleaned and main-tained.\nAlong with the first flush system, a\nfilter needs to be installed to prevent\nsmall organisms and detritus infecting the water. A simple mechanical\nfilter can remove small items from the\nwater, and one prospect considered is\nthe sand filter. This looks a bit like\na ceramic flower pot, but contains\nsand of varying coarseness which\nremoves smaller solutes as the water\nflows further down the filter. However, due to the amount of water involved and time it takes to filter, this\ndoesn\u2019t seem like a viable solution for\nour large tanks, and will instead be\nused in the Training of Trainers program for smaller household-scale water tanks. A different design of filter,\nwhich can handle much larger quantities of water, will be implemented for\nthe big tanks.\nTo remove biological hazards in\nwater, it is common to boil it, but the\nTraining of Trainers program will\nincorporate another, more practical\nmethod. Most dwellings in the villages of Tanzania are self-made and\nfeature corrugated iron roofs. Water\nin transparent bottles or jars can be\nplaced on the roofs and the heat from\nthe sun is reflected and focused to the\nwater, killing most of the microbes\npresent. This has an advantage over\nboiling \u2013 the sun\u2019s light also contains\nultraviolet radiation, which most\nhigh-tech water filters use to purify\nwater! This is a cheap, sustainable\nand low-tech alternative and we hope\nit will prove a huge success.\nSo although you may hear us talking a lot about rainwater harvesting\nsystems, remember there is much\nmore that needs to be done to create a sustainable supply of fresh wa-ter. Any donations you make will go\na long way to help us realising this\nproject. To find out more about Raincatcher Imperial, or to donate money\nthrough Virgin Money Giving, please\nvisit www.raincatcherimperial.org.\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX Friday 03 february 2012 37\nB\ny now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve\nheard a lot about Raincatcher\u2019s aims. But how\nmuch of the technology\nbehind our systems do\nyou know about?\nIn order to support our aim of providing clean, sustainable supplies of\nwater to people who currently cannot\naccess it, Raincatcher sends a team to\nTanzania every year to build rainwater harvesting systems.\nAs with many equatorial countries,\nTanzania\u2019s climate fluctuates between\nextremes year round; during the wet\nseason, there is plenty of rain providing sufficient supplies of water,\nbut during the dry season, water resources become scarce. Our rainwater harvesting systems are built so\nthat water can be collected in the wet\nseason, usually from buildings with\nlarge roofs like schools and church-es. The water is then sent by gutters\nto a vast tank for storage until it is\nneeded. Typically, the tanks can hold\na few hundred thousand litres of wa-ter. This year, our aim is to build two\n100,000L tanks for two schools in the\nvillage of Igunga.\nHowever, there are some important\npoints to consider when building a\nwater tank on this scale. The initial\nconcern is the size. The standard concrete tanks that Raincatcher uses can\nonly hold a maximum of 150,000L of\nwater above ground; any more water\nand the pressure inside will rupture\nthe structure. In the past, Raincatcher\nteams have built tanks which can hold\n250,000 litres of water underground,\nwhich had the advantage of being\nable to balance the pressure.\nAnother factor to consider is the\nissue of the first flush. When it rains\nand water collects from the roofs,\nthere is often dust and other sediment\ntransported with it, which are not\nclean to drink. The idea of the first\nflush is to drain away the volume of\nwater that contains the residue so that\nsubsequent flows are uncontaminat-ed. This has to be incorporated into\nthe design of the tank, which we have\nsolved by using a diversion chamber;\nthe first flush will fill this chamber\nand, once full, water can pass on to\nthe tank. The chamber is then drained\nThe technology behind Raincatcher\nPavitar Devgon explains rainwater harvesting systems\n\u201cThe are some important points to\nconsider when building a water tank on\nthis scale\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just about the aims with Raincatcher\n\n"

    "content": "I\ndon\u2019t generally read all that much fan-tasy, at least compared science fiction,\nbut I was drawn to Patrick Rothfuss\u2019\nKingkiller Chronicle by a pair of very\npositive reviews in Locus and the\nMagazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. I\nbought the first book in the series, The Name\nof the Wind, but it was left neglected on my\nshelves for several months \u2013 the consequence\nof a huge backlog in my reading list.\nOne boring recent evening, however, I was\nlooking through my bookshelf for something\nto read. I skimmed through the first few pages\nDon Quixote; Kafka\u2019s collected short stories\nand Simmons\u2019 Hyperion but nothing especially caught my fancy. Then I picked up The\nName of the Wind and the next thing I knew\nit was past midnight and I was some half\nway through the novel. As soon as I was finished I picked up the sequel, The Wise Man\u2019s\nFear (the third book in the trilogy has not yet\nbeen released), and, despite it weighing in at\nalmost a thousand pages, I worked my way\nthrough it little more than a weekend.\nThe series\u2019 massive success is certainly\nunexpected. On the surface it seems like\nstandard fantasy fare \u2013 a magical school, or\nmore specifically a university; an evil plot to\ndestroy the world; a noble race of warriors \u2013\ndoes any of this sound familiar? As soon as\nyou open either of the books you even see an\nutterly generic and not especially well drawn\nmap of the sort that is clearly inspired by\nTolkien and commonly appears in the work\nof unexceptional authors such as Juliet McKenna and Adrian Tchaikovsky. One\u2019s expectations are hardly likely to be raised by the fact\nthe an accurate description of the plot is that\nit\u2019s an account \u2013 presented in real time \u2013 of\nthree men sitting in a bar and talking.\nIt\u2019s what they\u2019re talking about that\u2019s interesting as Kvothe, famed musician, sword-fighter and magic user who has, for some as\nyet unknown reason, been forced into hiding\nand is posing as innkeeper in a small village,\nrecounts the story of his life to his apprentice\nand a historian. This is where Rothfuss shows\nhis skill at moulding mundane and tired subject matter into something exceptional. His\nclear, engaging style draws you in immedi-ately. Soon you begin to notice that the author\u2019s strength lies not only in style but also\nin plotting and worldbuilding, as he expands\non common tropes in the genre to create a fas-BOOKS\nFELIX Friday 03 february 2012 35\nIn Praise of Daunt Books\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ncinating and original work.\nWhat was particularly good was the mythic\nback-story of the universe of the book. We\ndon\u2019t get any clear-cut exposition or a precise\ntimeline of events presented in an appendix \u00e0\nla The Lord of the Rings. Rather Kvothe, that\nis the younger Kvothe of the story within a\nstory, learns of the ancient events that eventually come to shape his destiny through half\nforgotten legends, religious propaganda and\nold children\u2019s bedtime stories. Kvothe, and\nthe reader, being left to decipher the truth\nfrom these fragments adds a lot to the books\nand serves as a fascinating examination of\nhow facts can become twisted through time.\nAlso noteworthy is the magic system in The\nKingkiller Chronicle. I am of the opinion that\nmagic in fiction works best when it is either\nleft very mysterious, like, say, in The Lord of\nthe Rings, or when it follows strict, well explained rules. A system that tries to take the\nmiddle road, such as that in the Harry Potter books, very rarely works. A story where\nthe various incantations cause weird things\nto happen for some unexplained reason, with\narbitrary limitations, quickly gets frustrating\nand leaves the door wide open for deus ex\nmachina endings. The Kingkiller Chronicle is\nspecial since it actually features both types of\nthe \u2018good\u2019 magic \u2013 firstly a mysterious Wizard\nof Earthsea style name-based magic and secondly the more commonly used \u201csympathy\u201d.\nSince this latter form is so well explained it\nlets the readers understand the characters\u2019\nlimitations and means that whenever they\nuse their arcane abilities it just seems natu-ral. It also unique and refreshing in that it is\npresented in a scientific manner. Sympathy\nactually obeys conservation of energy and\nlectures at the aforementioned magical university involve students having to memorise\nThe Kingkiller Chronicle\nefficiency tables for various \u2018spells\u2019.\nIt would be remiss not to also mention the\nframing device. I have previously said how\nmuch I like a story where an older version of\nthe character recounts the story of their life\nas it really allows the reader to get in their\nheads. This is especially relevant in this story\nsince, as could be expected of an exceptionally skilled teenager, the younger Kvothe is\noften arrogant and full of himself. This could\nhave easily become annoying and obnoxious if not for the older Kvothe pointing out,\nmostly through nothing more than a somewhat disproving tone, how stupid his younger\nself really was at times. The framing device\nalso provides much of the driving force for\nthe story \u2013 though the two time periods in\nthe novel are only some ten years apart the\nolder Kvothe is a drastically different, broken\nman \u2013 leaving the reader to wonder how he\nbecame this way.\nThis is a truly unforgettable series \u2013 I would\ngo so far as to say that in many ways it rivals Tolkien. Everything about it just seems\nto work and fit together to create something\nexceptional. I am certainly looking forward\nto the conclusion, The Doors of Stone, and\nadvise you all to check out the first two books\nbefore it comes out.\nMaciej Matuszewski reviews Patrick Rothfuss\u2019 bestselling fantasy epic\nThere are two Daunt Books stores close to where I\nlive and whenever I pass one I simply have to stop\nand have a look inside. It\u2019s simply the sort of shop\nthat draws you in. From its beautiful wooden bookshelves to its wide selection of literature and frequent author events Daunt Books has everything\na book lover could want.\nSet up some twenty years by James Daunt, a\nformer investment banker who last year was appointed the managing director of Waterstones,\nthis is a bibliophile\u2019s dream and a chain like no\nother. Its unique selling point is that it groups\nmost of its books by geographical location. This\nmeans you are likely to find travel guides, history\nbooks, and translations of novels all together on\nthe same shelf. This is a great system that often\nleads those browsing the stacks to great books\nthat they might have never considered. It is refreshing to see such an international outlook \u2013\nmy experience of other bookshops in this country\nbeing that they focus mainly on English language\nliterature. It certainly expands one\u2019s mind to read\nbooks from other cultures so its great that there\u2019s\nsomewhere in London where you can find obscure\nCzech, German and Japanese novels.\nDaunt Books has six branches all over London \u2013\nfrom Fulham Road in Chelsea to Marylebone High\nStreet, so you have no excuse not to check one\nout. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nWe need contributors! Do you have a passion for books? Do you want to write about lit-erature?

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 03 february 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nThe newly redesigned Exhibition Road saw\nits grand opening take place last Wednesday. Away from the usual buffoonery (read:\nmetal elephants that Felix still doesn\u2019t quite\ncomprehend perfectly) and tussles for photo\nopportunities that accompany any form of\nvisit from the current Mayor of London the\nfact remains that the redesign cost \u00a330m,\nand while the visual changes are plain to\nsee, the reasoning behind them is somewhat muddier.\nThe designers have promised that despite\nwhat seems like an unintuitive idea to begin\nwith (namely a lack of solid guidelines for\ntraffic or crossings for pedestrians), there\nwill ultimately prove to be a bevy of improvements over the previous design, including a\nreduction in traffic by 30% and an increased\nobservation by both driver and pedestrian.\nFor \u00a330m, one would certainly hope so. Nevertheless, in its current state, \u2018increased\nobservation\u2019 will most likely prove to be a\nsynonym for \u2018anxious watching\u2019 as students\nattempt to find the best area to cross a road\nwith an ever changing traffic flow, and motorists (some of whom, of course, will be unfamiliar with the new layout) attempt to avoid\npotentially grim consequences as students,\ntourists and other pedestrians edge out\nfrom behind parked cars.\nThe reduction in road signs is mystifying.\nFor such a laissez-faire attitude to be thrust\nupon users of the road, one would have to\nplace a great deal of faith in road users.\nHowever, many who use the road aren\u2019t regular residents, such as tourists for museums\nand the surrounding area. A prime example\nis the roundabout at the corner with Prince\nConsort Road. Situated on a prime route to\nEthos, it is a popular location to cross for\nstudents. Now, turning for cars is only vaguely regulated. Confusion reigns, especially\nwhen car indicators are not even used.\nConsider the behaviour of motorists on\nQueen\u2019s Gate and the surrounding area. Particularly at busy times, little consideration\ncan often be shown to those waiting at zebra\ncrossings. As problems still exist in other locations around campus, whether due to the\nlocation of crossings or other traffic regulations that could be improved, is it really time\nto give drivers more free reign?\nWhile pioneering schemes such as the Exhibition Road redesign are to be admired for\ntheir scope and ambition, one can\u2019t help but\nfeel that there has been a major oversight\nwith the new layout with regards to the public\nand many students who use the road every-day. Despite the shine of the newly cleaned\nmuseums, we mustn\u2019t be dazzled by the\naesthetic impact. Traffic around campus is\nstill a key issue and hasn\u2019t yet been cracked.\nWe must study the new Exhibition Road and\ndetermine for ourselves whether an improvement is incoming any time soon.\nFELIX\nElephants can\u2019t hide\nExhibition Road worries\nP\nlease do not read the following if you do not like\ncontroversial material.\nThe debate over the le-galisation of drugs has\nwittered on for as long as we\u2019ve had\ndrugs, or at least laws about them.\nThose of you who think that drugs\nare dangerous for the public at large\nwill probably give good arguments for\nthe criminalisation of their use, possession and trade. Likewise, those of\nyou who regard drugs as a matter of\npersonal choice beyond the remit of\nthe government or police can probably\noffer equally valid counter-arguments.\nI, myself, think the most sensible\noption would be to legalise all drugs.\nProhibition of anything has never really worked. The greatest historical\nexample of this folly comes from the\neponymous era in the USA, especially\nin Chicago. All prohibition did was\ndrive money and power into the hands\nof mobsters, both of which they have\nbeen reluctant to relinquish ever since.\nInstead of simply legalising drugs\nsuch as heroin and cocaine and leaving the population to their own de-vices, we should provide a reputable\nmarket for their sale. So much of the\ndanger of illicit drugs is in the mystery\nof whatever they\u2019ve been cut with,\nand the lengths people go to acquire\nthem. An above-board market would\nbring with it standards in formula-tion, dose, and purity and would leech\nsignificant control away from career\ncriminals (and I don\u2019t mean City of\nLondon bankers). After all, who can\ncompete with Tesco\u2019s prices?\nHowever, even I\u2019m not optimistic\nenough to think that Fair Trade cocaine will significantly improve the\nlives and working conditions of its\nproducers in Bolivia \u2013 well, maybe I\nam. Such a radical change in criminal and supermarket forces would be\nnear-impossible to organise, and the\ngangsters won\u2019t like it. Neither will\nthe Daily Mail, I\u2019m sure. There would\nof course have to be checks. It should\nstill be illegal to sell these drugs to\nanyone under 18, or 21, say, and using in a public place would be forbid-den, excluding properties, clubs and\nthe like, with a certain license. What\npeople do in the privacy of their own\nhomes, however, should be their own\nbusiness, within reason.\nAs with the nature of this debate, I\ndon\u2019t expect this proposal to be universally lauded but I do believe it\nmakes sense. Decriminalisation will\nfree up the police to pursue other\ncrime and a legal market would bring\nwith it taxation and revenue. Kaching. The idea that legalisation will\nturn us all into crackasmackheads (my\nown term) doesn\u2019t really hold water.\nAlcohol and nicotine are both perfectly legal and yet we don\u2019t all go around\nboozing and puffing. Other drugs are\ndangerous, true, but these are no ex-ception. I\u2019ve seen enough patients on\nthe wards that have gone bright yellow and can\u2019t catch a single breath.\nThis is just the start though.\nIn the 21st century, we should be\nable to be the complete masters of\nour own reality. Some people have\nescaped the drudgery of this heaven\nand earth for one of their own design\nin Second Life on the internet. Using\ndrugs, from alcohol to LSD, is but one\nway to abscond this reality, if only for\na time. Others choose to augment their\nappearance through tattoos, piercings\nor stonking great breast implants.\nApossible high society\nAll this is fine but it doesn\u2019t go far\nenough.\nThe one aspect of our lives that is\nbeyond our tangible control is how\nlong it lasts. Until that time comes,\nwe should express ourselves to the\nfull extent of our desire and capac-ity. I want to walk down the street and\nsee a guy with a horn in the middle of\nhis forehead. I want to fall asleep in\nthe radiant arms of my girlfriend who\nglows in the dark. I don\u2019t particularly\nwant to see people wandering around\nwith cat ears or a tail but that\u2019s a matter of personal taste. What really matters is what you want to do, what you\nwant to look like, what you want to\nbe.\nWe have the technology to make all\nthis possible. Reconstruction surgeons\nmust be itching to do something other\nthan treat burns victims and insecure\nHarley Street patrons. Jellyfish and\nother fantastic oddballs of DNA have\nthe genes that enable us to some really\nweird stuff. Luminescence is simply\npage one material.\nWe should also have access to normally medicinal drugs to modulate\nand alter our bodily function. Nearly\nevery drug has its own niche side-effect. If Big Pharma knew there was\na market for it on the other end, they\nwouldn\u2019t have a problem emphasising\nthis otherwise small print. Personally,\nI would take rifampicin daily to turn\nmy urine bright orange. How great\nwould that be!\nFor more than a decade, we have\nbeen able to become whoever we want\non the internet. Allowing real life to\nbecome dull and restrictive by comparison is the real crime at the centre\nof the drugs debate. You may scoff at\nmy far-reaching proposals but I believe they have some merit. It would\ncertainly brighten up the journey into\ncollege each morning!\nDo you enjoy\nanonymously\nexerting your\nintellectual\nsuperiority\nover people\nyou\u2019ll never\ntalk to ever\nagain? Well,\nfelixonline.\nco.uk is the\nplace for you!\nAs with the nature\nof this debate, I\ndon\u2019t expect this\nproposal to be\nuniversally lauded\nbut I do believe it\nmakes sense\n\u201c\nAs with\nAs with\nof this\nof this\nRhys Davies\nI don\u2019t know what drug he\u2019s taken to make his head so big\n\n"

    "content": "THREE-BUTTON SUIT\nThe Man\nThe three-button suit is generally seen as\nthe more traditionally elegant of the suits\nwith its buttons spanning a larger area of\nthe torso. Resulting from its top button\nresting higher up on the chest than its other single-breasted cousins, the three-but-ton suit draws attention to said area, increasing the width of its appearance \u2013 this\nis not a suit for those with highly-devel-oped pectorals, or conversely (tragically?),\nman boobs. Ideal for taller men, particularly those over 6ft, the three-button is a\nclassic, worn by ex-Bond Pierce Brosnan\nand increasingly popular with rising stars\nseeking extra style points and adult recognition including Robert Pattinson.\nDOUBLE-BREASTED\nSUIT\nThe Occasion\nMost definitely a formal choice, the three-button suit is a great alternative to its\nmore popular two-button cousin for those\nyearning for a spark of individuality in the\noffice. The extra dash of business refinement emanating from this suit gives an\nextra confidence boost on those all important interview days whilst on another note,\nshould men have \u2018off days\u2019; this piece is\ndefinitely one to turn to as the longer span\nof the triple buttons hides much of the\ntorso area including, perhaps hopefully,\nwhere you spilt your coffee in the morning.\nThe Catwalk\nProtect from the cold whilst journeying to and\nfrom the office by adding winter accessories\nto your three-buttoned suit.

However, in the more complicated real world it can be broken down\nas such: doing only the middle button is\nstandard and sleek; doing up the top two\nrequires an increased level of confidence in\nones stance; doing up just the top can be\nseen as far too \u201ccontemporary\u201d (read \u2018hipster\u2019) for the office; whilst all three tends\nto look too strict. On top of this, it must\nremembered that the top button should be\nleft undone if the lapel of the suit rolls down\nto it.\nFELIX\nFriday 03 february 2012\n30\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion Editors: Saskia Verhagen\nAlice Yang\nFASHION\nSuit Up: an idiot\u2019s guide to the who, what,\nA wise man once said that there is only one thing a man can do when he\u2019s suffering from a spiritual and existential funk.

Colour and textural variation in\ngeneral was prominent, with dark blues\nat Gucci, pinstripes at Alexander McQueen and wider stripes at Canali.

Thankfully, this stereotype no longer applies. A favourite of\nHumphrey Bogart, and more recently, a\ncertain Chuck Bass (this is a good thing,\nfor those unaware), the DB has been enjoying a revival of sorts.

The \u00a333,820 total, the vast majority of which comes from the Clubs & Societies\nBoard owing to its large budget, will be reallocated to help improve student activity support\nservices.\nWriting last Friday in his official blog Deputy President (Finance & Services) Michael\nFoster explained the Committee\u2019s reasoning\nin making the decision, saying that \u201cwhile\nstudent activity has been increasing yearly \u2013\nalong with how much money Clubs, Societies\n& Projects (CSPs) are saving \u2013 there has been\nlittle-to-no increase in the resources available for supporting these groups\u201d.

He\nadded that while the Union accounts \u201care on\nrestricted circulation\u201d, and so not available\nonline \u201cinterested Union members can see\nthem whenever they wish\u201d by \u201c coming to the\nUnion and asking to see them\u201d.\nWhile this may remain a controversial decision for some it certainly has potential to improve the student experience at Imperial.

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX\nFriday 03 february 2012\n34\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood Editors: Anastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\nThere are so many to choose from! Some of\nthe franchises do offer a great menu and at\nvery reasonable prices. I\u2019m a big fan of Jamie\u2019s Italian, Giraffe and Wagamama for a\nquick bite to eat. But everybody knows about\nthese.\nSome of the best places though are those\nthat need hunting out! Bea\u2019s of Bloomsbury\nis awesome, as is John Torrode\u2019s Smiths of\nSmithfield, which can\u2019t be beaten for break-fast! Aside from that I know that there are\nthousands of restaurants I\u2019ve not yet had the\nchance to try. So keep your eyes peeled for\nvouchers and coupons that offer you introductory offers. Some of the best meals I\u2019ve\nenjoyed over the past six months have been at\nhalf price or less. So you end up with a two\nor three courses of outstanding food for the\nsame price as one or two at a franchise.\nWhen was your last \u2018bad experience\u2019 with\nfood?\nThere is no such thing as a bad food experience in my eyes \u2013 only a learning curve.\nWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? If you\u2019re\ncooking at home and a meal doesn\u2019t quite\ngo to plan, then you\u2019ve learnt for next time,\nright? Just experiment and if you\u2019re really unsure then why not give it a go it with friends\n\u2013 make it a joint effort.\nThe biggest chance of suffering a bad experience is when everything is out of your\ncontrol, like when eating out. We all love dining out and it\u2019s great for inspiration, special\noccasions or even just when you\u2019re feeling\na bit lazy. However, if you can create great,\nsimple, cheap and tasty food at home with\nyour mates, then that has to win every time\nin my book!\nHaving said that we\u2019ve all had some clumsy\nmoments, and working in front of cameras\nwhen you\u2019re cooking makes for extra trouble!\nYou only have to take a look at some of our\nouttakes and bloopers to see what I mean!\nTo find out more about SORTED (and to\nsee some of those bloopers!) pay a visit\nto sortedfood.com\nsocial cooking with friends.\nThat\u2019s where the videos started, a chance\nto share our ideas and philosophy of social\ncooking with more than just our mates and\nfriends of friends. YouTube became the perfect platform to share new recipes with a\nlarger audience \u2013 the world, in fact! It didn\u2019t\nchange what we did... we were pretty much\njust playing about with mates in the kitchen.\nNow, our online channels are our focus and\nweek after week we get the recipe requests\nand food dilemmas of our audience SORTED. Delivering quick, simple and tasty dish-es, heavily seasoned with banter.\nWe would love to have some cooking ad-vice! What do you think are the secrets of\ncooking good food?\nGood food is very subjective. What is good to\none person might not be to the liking of an-other. Which is why I believe a recipe should\nonly ever be a guideline. So many of the\nSORTED recipes reflect nothing more than\na series of steps, which could be applied to\nyour own favourite ingredients. Make it per-sonal. You\u2019ll see this theme cropping up in\nso much of what SORTED does; recipe ideas\nthat are so simple they work even when a few\nbits are changed.\nAside from that, try to start with the best\ningredients you can afford. Trust me, I\u2019m not\ntalking about expensive filet steak or high-end lobster, what I mean is go for stuff that is\nseasonal. That way the quality will be better\nand it\u2019ll be affordable too.\nOn top of that, club together with mates and\ncook up a treat. For example, it\u2019s nearly impossible to cook a meal for \u00a32 when you\u2019re\ncooking alone. But to cater for you and three\nfriends on a budget of \u00a38 is easy! Scale makes\ngood food possible. And on those evenings\nwhen you\u2019re cooking on your own, still make\nseveral portions and then save the rest as left-overs, either to be frozen or used up the next\nday.\nWhich restaurant or caf\u00e9 do you recommend in London?\nWhat is SORTED in one sentence?\nWe\u2019re a genuine bunch of mates who teamed\nup to run SORTED Food, an online cooking\nhub that aims to solve the food problems of\nour audience, and to prove that you can have a\nbit of fun in the kitchen; cooking doesn\u2019t have\nto be so serious!\nWhy do you believe SORTED will be of interest to Imperial?\nThe SORTED crew have a lot of fun doing\nwhat they do. It never feels like work \u2013 it\u2019s\njust messing around in the kitchen with your\nmates, cooking up simple, tasty grub to share,\nand we hope this comes across on screen. For\nthat reason the videos are good fun and our\ncurrent audience finds them pretty entertain-ing, returning week after week to see what\nnew recipe inspiration they can enjoy.\nBut beyond that, SORTED provides a ser-vice: a compelling library of over 150 video\nrecipes (with more released every week),\nmaking up a wide variety of dishes for every\noccasion. Recipes from all over the world:\nsweet and savoury, twists on classic favou-rites, ideas that are perfect to impress or fast\nmid-week meals for a budget. No matter what\ncooking experience you currently have, you\u2019ll\nfind the SORTED recipes are dead easy and\ncan allow even the biggest novice to churn\nout food to be proud of.\nHow did you get the initial idea?\nThe whole story kicked off a few years back\nsat around a pub table as we shared recipes on\nbeer mats. As a trained chef, I was shocked\nby what my closest friends were eating, so\nI would share the perfect student grub that\nwas anything other than takeaways and pot\nnoodles.\nAs a photographer at the time, Barry saw an\nopportunity to create and publish a cookbook\ncrammed full of my recipes and his creative\nwork that would be perfect for students. A\nway in which we could share what we loved\nwith a few more people. And we\u2019ve never\nlooked back. We put together a student cookbook (doing all the work ourselves) and then\nset out to share these recipes and the idea of\nGet your food life SORTED\nAnastasia Eleftheriou grills Ben Ebbrell, head chef at online recipe website SORTED, about bringing some banter to the kitchen\nBen Ebbrell (second from right) and the SORTED team, putting Take That to shame\nSORTED\nCooking... to the extreeeeeeeeeeeme\nDessert of the week\nThis is a traditional Cypriot recipe for a dessert\ncalled \u201cLoukoumades\u201d. It makes about 80 pieces.\nIngredients\nFor the dough:\n3 cups all purpose flour\n1 tbsp instant yeast\nWater at 40\u00b0C\n1 boiled and mashed potato\nFor the syrup:\n1 cup honey\n1 cup sugar\n1 cup water\nProcedure\nMix the flour and the yeast in a bowl. Add water\nuntil the mixture becomes a thick batter. Cover\nthe bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for about\nan hour.\nIn the meantime, prepare the syrup. Place all the\ningredients in a saucepan and boil until everything\nis dissolved. Let the syrup cool. Add the mashed\npotato in the batter and mix. Put a lot of oil in\na deep pan because the doughnuts will be deep\nfried. To get round-shaped doughnuts you must\nfollow this procedure:\n\u2013 Fill your right hand with batter and close your\nhand so that batter comes out between your\nthumb and first finger.\n\u2013 With your left hand hold a teaspoon, scoop the\nbatter that comes out and throw it in the hot oil.\n\u2013 Every time you scoop batter, put the teaspoon in\nwater so that it remains clean and no batter will\nstick on it.\nThe doughnuts are ready when they are golden.\nRemove them from the oil and place them immediately in the syrup for 2\u20133 seconds. Remove them\nfrom the syrup and place them in a large plate.\nYiango Mavrocostanti\nCypriot Doughnuts\nSend your Valentine\u2019s Day\nrecipes to:\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEnjoy them hot, soaked in syrup... hnnnnnnng\n\n"

Effortless and perfectly dapper, this single\nbuttoned garment is a red carpet favourite including Benedict Cumberbatch and\nMark Ronson \u2013 such wearers carry themselves with pride in the full knowledge\nthat they are turning heads and sending\nhearts a-flutter.\nTWO-BUTTON SUIT\nThe Occasion\nUndeniably a casual suit jacket, the versatility of the single button suit is its se-cret. Thanks to its debonair sleek cut,\nit allows one to be more avant-garde\nthan when donning its contemporaries,\nbestowing onto its wearer a chance to\nexperiment with lapels, collars, textures,\nand colours. Shoes, shirt and tie combinations also allow more room for experiment - from classic black and white\ncombinations to more daring personality\nfilled patterns; ties, bowties and braces;\nbrogues, loafers and even boots; extra\npoints are awarded here for courage\nand originality. Whether it be for friendly\ndrinks or (unelegantly put) a night out\non the pull, the one-button suit is best\nwhen worn when not required by dress\ncode for that extra dash of gentlemanly\nsuave.\nThe Catwalk\nExtravagance is most definitely to be\nembraced with the single-buttoned suit\nas designers gave the fashion world a\nnew way of expressing ones personality after dark. Dolce and Gabbana opted\nfor rich golden embroidery and ornate\nbaroque swirls inspired by the decorative Oscar Wilde, a muse for many of\nthis season\u2019s collections. A more luxurious look was preferred at Viktor & Rolf\nand Lanvin who\u2019s shimmering fabrics\nand complementing bowties craved the\nattention of the extrovert creating the\nperfect dinner date outfit. -AY\nThe Rules\nTailoring is a must and confidence is\nkey. So long as the suit fits snugly\n(strained fabric is far too tight; long\nsleeves and baggy chest is far too\nlarge), and your posture is distinguish-ably upright, the world is your oyster.\nAn easy, fuss-free item of clothing, it\ndemands only to be buttoned up when\nits wearer is stood, and unbuttoned every time they sit \u2013 this really is dressing\nup dumbed down.\nThe Rules\nThere is really only one rule here: only\nthe top button should be fastened (defin-ing the waist), but never the second. The\nsecond button is aesthetically necessary\nbut technically superfluous and pulls the\njacket completely out of shape if done up.\nOther than this, you\u2019re fairly safe in most\ncolour and fabric choices. Pockets may be\nslanted, a reference to the days of hacking\njackets \u2013 the slant allowed easier access\nto pockets on horseback. Breast pockets\nare omnipresent, but ticket pockets, an occasional addition above the main pockets,\ntend to look better on a three-button suit.\nThe Man\nArguably the easiest of the suits to wear,\nthe two-button suit makes the best of almost any figure. A favourite of suit-wearing\nicons including John F. Kennedy, Cary Grant\nand Frank Sinatra, this is a choice that is\nalmost idiot-proof in its ability to bring the\ninner suave, sophisticated gentleman out\nof the most dishevelled and hopeless of\nmen. Provided the suit fits properly, and is\ncombined with a well-chosen shirt and tie,\nyou will find yourself transformed \u2013 at once\nelegant, effortless, and perfectly refined.\nThe Occasion\nThe two-button suit is probably going to\nbe your most reliable asset in most formal settings. For the full effect, pair a\nblack pinstripe suit with a light blue shirt\nand a dark grey pin-dot tie, silver tie bar\nand white pocket square. Shoes and belt\nshould be black leather, simple and pol-ished. For the weekend, simply pair your\nsuit jacket with some smart dark blue\njeans \u2013 cuffed \u2013 and keep your shirt in a\nsimilar blue tone. Penny loafers, no socks\n\u2013 it\u2019s all in the details.\nThe Catwalk\nSeen in almost every combination of tone,\npattern and texture, the two-button suit\nalso seems to have succumbed to the\ntheme of certain striking colour choices.\nA jewel-toned velvet incarnation with contrasting trousers was seen at Burberry\nProrsum, Prince of Wales check at Alexander McQueen, contrasting lapels at Louis\nVuitton, and vivid, solid colour in an incredibly flattering slim cut at Gucci \u2013 it has to be\nsaid, Frida Giannini cuts a wicked suit. -SV\nBurberry Prorsum Alexander McQueen Gucci Dolce & Gabbana Lanvin Viktor & Rolf\n\u201cthis is a choice that is\nalmost idiot-proof in its\nabillity to bring [out] the\ninner suave\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Whilst many students were having a lie-in\non Saturday 21 January, the 16 students\nselected to participate in the 2012 Imperial Apprentice Challenge arrived at the\nBusiness School, complete with suits,\nlaptops, and determination, ready to conquer the challenges organised by the Imperial Entrepreneurs society.\nThe four teams, Zeus, Ipsum, Collateral, and Tornado, battled for the privilege\nof representing Imperial in the London\nUniversity Apprentice Challenge against\nLSE, Kings, UCL and Royal Holloway.\nIn addition to entry into the London com-petition, the winning team received cash\nand prizes from sponsors Proctor and\nGamble. The weekend consisted of four\nchallenges based on Strategy, Marketing,\nSales, and Product Development, followed by a live final. The judging panel\nconsisted of guests from Ernst andYoung,\nE-Synergy and the Imperial College Business School. Adding to the pressure was\nthe fact the team members\u2019 every move\nwas captured on film and selected scenes\nincluded in a film showing highlights of\nthe event (search for \u2018ImperialApprentice\nChallenge 2012\u2019on YouTube).\nThe first task, the Strategy challenge,\nrequired the teams to \u201cCreate value from\nnothing.\u201d First, they had to obtain an item\nfor free, then proceed to trade the item up\nuntil they obtained items of higher value.\nThe value created in just two hours was\nastounding. The winners of this demanding but fun task were Collateral (Andre,\nAlex, Max and Hari) who secured a gift\nbag containing a \u00a3110 chauffeur driven\ncooperate car voucher, an expensive bottle of wine and various other treats from\na hotel. The total value was estimated to\nbe over \u00a3160!\nThe second challenge, the Marketing\nChallenge, provided participants with the\nopportunity to rest their legs. Each team\nwere assigned one of four companies \u2013\nSnog frozen yoghurts, Gatorade energy\ndrinks, Talk mobile and Vitaminwater\n\u2013 and had to decide upon a second company which they propose could carry our\njoint marketing. They had to plan a three\nminute elevator pitch, as if representing\nthe first company and persuading the\nsecond to come on board, to be presented\nto the judges in the live final. The teams\nhad to identify the target market, specify\nhow they intend to advertise and justify\nwhy it would be mutually beneficial to\nboth companies. This joint marketing approach has proven popular recently with,\nfor example, companies such as McDonalds and Weight Watchers forming a marketing partnership; McDonalds benefit\nfrom an improved reputation regarding\nthe nutritional quality of their food and\nWeight Watchers reaches a target audience far larger than it could achieve\nalone.Asecond example: the cooperation\nbetween Spotify and Lucozade.All teams\nwere innovative in their approach to this\ntask and pitched their ideas successfully\nto the judging panel. Following the pitch-Greece broke the rule every year, but interestingly neither Spain nor Ireland nor\nItaly ever broke the 3% rule. Once again\nit was left to the ethereal \u201cmarket confidence\u201d to decide where the safe debt\nwas. The markets saw Germany as the\ngood guy, with Spain and Italy unfairly\nportrayed as the villains.\nLooking at the 10 year period between\n2000-10, it is actually Germany whose\ngovernment debt rose the most (almost\n25%), whereas Spain and Italy remained\npretty flat. In the case of Spain and Ireland, the problem wasn\u2019t the govern-ments; it was the private sector: businesses and individuals. The Spanish and\nIrish private debt saw a huge increase.\nAnd much of that money was invested\nin buying German goods creating a debt\nfuelled boom: Germany would give\naway cheap credits to countries that\nwould spend the money in buying German goods.\nDuring these boom years, debt was\ncheap and heavy borrowing led to an accelerated growth rate. The Spanish and\nItalians\u2019 salaries increased significantly,\nwhilst Germans had a rather flat growth\nin pay. That was fine while debt was still\ncheap during the boom years; however,\nas the economic downturn started, borrowing rates rose sharply. Suddenly all\nthis debt was unaffordable to sustain.\nSpanish and Italian goods became un-competitive compared to German goods\nas customers could no longer borrow to\nafford inflated prices. This loss of com-business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nBUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 03 february 2012 13\nA not so happy birthday\nO\nn January 1, 2012, a major economic milestone\nwas reached: the Euro\u2019s\n10th birthday. Although\nthe Euro had officially\nbeen in existence since 1995 and was introduced into financial markets in 1999,\nit wasn\u2019t until 2002 that notes and coins\nwere issued in circulation. The Euro is\nan important currency; it is not only the\nsecond largest reserve currency but it\nis also the most circulated, with almost\n\u20ac900bn in circulation. It is the currency\nof 17 of the 27 European Union member states, a population of more than\n330 million, not forgetting the numerous countries (mainlyAfrican) who have\ncurrencies pegged against the Euro. This\ntotals to about 500 million people, 1/12\nof the globe\u2019s population, who directly\nuse this currency. It was all going so\nwell. Then the Global Economic crisis\nhappened, and in 2009, it had to battle\nagainst the Sovereign Debt Crisis. To say\nthe last few years have been hard for the\nEuro is a bit of an understatement. So,\nwhat really went wrong?\nIt has been said that the sovereign debt\ncrisis was caused by excessive borrowing by European governments. The Germans have been portrayed as the heroes\nof the situation, doing their bit to help\ntheir European brethren, and they seem\nto be coping comparatively well. But are\nthey really that innocent?\nAs a part of the new agreement to try\nand save the Euro, the German government have insisted that a ceiling is put\nin place limiting governments\u2019 borrowing to 0.5% of their output, aiming to\nstop debt growing too quickly. But if\nwe turn the clocks back 15 years, there\nwas already a deficit ceiling, a 3% limit\nthat was put in the treaties that set up the\nEuro, again insisted on by the Germans.\nBut it was Germany who broke this\n3% rule first in 2003, and it has done it\nfor about half of the years of the Euro.\npetitiveness was due to higher labour\ncosts making it much harder for these\ncountries to kick start exports. Low exports at a time where debt was expensive\nlead to further economic slowdown. Unemployment went up and the problems\njust kept getting worse.\nSpending cuts may make debts harder\nto repay, but will not necessarily lead to\na rise in exports, and will probably result in further recession. But a continued\nspending risks bankrupting the country,\nresulting in spiralling shrinking of its\neconomy and in a loss in market confi-dence. This is the dilemma that most European governments now face.\nDuring the onset of the crisis, governments had to increase their borrowing to\nhelp support the collapsing private sec-tor. When a government has to borrow,\nit can devalue its own currency to help\nease the pain. Spain and Italy could not\ndevalue their currency though, as they\nwere tied up into the Euro. The high\nlevels of debt infected the whole single\ncurrency where everyone was suddenly\nbeing exposed to these high levels of\ndebt. This has not only crippled the Eurozone countries\u2019 economies, but has\ndramatically reduced the prestige of\nthe Euroclub. As the European economies weakened, debt market confidence\ndropped, and borrowing costs all over\nthe Eurozone increased.\nBut yet, after all of this, we are still\nbeing told the Germans played the right\ngame. That is not entirely true. As one\ncan see, a lot of the problems we are experiencing now are due to lending by the\nGermans. It seems they have used the\nsingle currency as a way to increase their\neconomic strength at the expense of the\nsmaller developing southern European\ncountries. The road ahead for the Euroclub is definitely a tough one. It is clear\nto almost everyone that for the Euro to\nreach its 11th birthday it will need radical reform.\nAnnabelle Mayers\nRajvinder Virdee on who he thinks is crashing the Euro\u2019s party\nApprentice Challenge 2012\n\u201cDebt was cheap\nand heavy borrowing\nled to an accelerated\ngrowth rate\u201d\nes, the judges scrutinized each team\u2019s\nefforts and presented them with thought\nprovoking questions.\nGiven a short while to recover from\nSaturday\u2019s challenges the teams met early\non Sunday morning to commence the second day of the Imperial Apprentice Challenge. For the Sales Challenge the teams,\nonce again, had to muster up the energy to\nrun around the local area interacting with\nstrangers. Given \u00a320, each team were\ntold to invest some or all of their money\nin stock from local shops or supermarkets and sell their purchases in whichever\nlocation they felt appropriate. The team\nwhich made the largest profit would win.\nPerformance was impressive with the\nmost successful team, Tornado, creating\na net profit of \u00a364 in just two hours. In\nthe Entrepreneurial spirit team Tornado\nacquired copies of the Financial Times\n(which are distributed for free in the business school) and managed to sell many\ncopies by knocking at peoples doors and\nselling to strangers in the street. Other\ninteresting approaches were seen: for ex-ample, team Ipsum sold water to runners\nin Hyde Park and Collateral made hot\nchocolate in free cups from Pret a Manger\nusing a kettle borrowed from halls and\nsold the warm drinks with cookies to cold\nLondoners.\nThe final, most demanding task, at least\nin terms of time management, was the\nProduct Development Challenge, which\nsaw each team design a new service or\nproduct to be launched by either Playboy or Ferrari. The teams were required\nto create a presentation outlining their\ninnovative idea, target market, marketing strategy, financial outlook and 5 year\nprojections. The outcome was to be presented to the audience and judging panel\nin the live final. Due to the nature of the\ncompanies some interesting ideas appeared on the whiteboard! Ipsum boldly\npursued the idea of Playboy \u2018adult toys\u2019\nwhilst collateral opted for a luxurious and\nprofessional Playboy spa. Team Tornado\nsaw great potential in exclusive Ferrari\nYachts whilst Zeus envisaged Luxury\nFerrari hotels.\nThe results of each team were an amalgamation of the outcome of the two active tasks and the judge\u2019s opinions of the\npitches and presentations. Team Tornado\ntriumphed, meaning the team members,\nEffie Kyrtata, Ignacio Doval, Sabrina\nGhiddi, and Isobel Qian will represent\nImperial in the London Apprentice in\nlate February. The Judges from Ernst and\nYoung, E-Synergy and the Imperial Business School commented on the impressive ideas and high quality presentations\nmade by all teams. They noted that the\nmarking was not easy as the standard of\nall teams was very high. Team Collateral\nfinished in a close second place followed\nby Ipsum and then Zeus.\nHere\u2019s to another ten years...?\n\n"

Not only is the student dream of free(ish) money, big booty\nhoes and four months off a year over, you\nhave to deal with the painful application process itself. First of all, why is it\nnecessary to apply for a job starting next\nSeptember a year in advance? Come on\nguys, it doesn\u2019t take that long to skim\nread a couple of pages! Surely they can\nstart things off a bit later on, giving us\n(and them) more time to ease back into\nthings after summer. It\u2019s bad enough dealing with labs, lectures and tutorials after a\nlazy summer let alone filling out a billion\njob applications on top of that.This brings\nme onto my main bone of contention.\nNow I completely understand a firm\ncan\u2019t just hire any old chump, but there\nis no need for the fallacy that is Competency Based Interviews. The word itself,\ncompetency, is an abhorrent example of\ncorporate-speak and, like most silly corporate terms, it was conceived in the 80s\nwhen most historians agree people were\ntoo busy doing cocaine and avoiding\nnuclear Armageddon (perhaps not at the\nsame time) to think very logically. The\npurpose of an interview is to evaluate the\ncandidate\u2019s motivation, skills and knowledge to find the ideal candidate for the\nrole (according to Wikipedia). This is precisely where a Competency Based Interview fails. The problem with them is that\nthey strongly favour the people who have\nCutting through the pain of haircuts\nCompetency, wompetency\nspent the most time preparing for them\nand not the people who are in reality most\nsuited for the role. Especially when you\nconsider that there is a plethora of books\nthat you can buy (Amazon has over 700)\nand there are even week long interview\ntraining courses that train you up.\nThinking about a \u201ctime when you\u2019ve\nsolved a problem in a group using initiative\u201d or something similarly ridiculous is\npretty hard to do on the spot when you\u2019ve\ngot a panel of grizzled interviewers, pens\nat the ready, waiting for you to open your\ncake hole. It\u2019s a horrible moment. Your\ncaffeine addled mind goes into overdrive,\ndrudging up half forgotten memories of\nthat group project you did in second\nyear where you did\u2026 oh shit what was\nit exactly? It\u2019s in that split second when\nyou notice your interviewer has the remnants of a long digested croissant stuck to\ntheir tie (true story there) and your train\nof thought is gone. It\u2019s now officially\nan awkward silence so you go \u201cBasically, erm\u2026\u201d and out comes a mumbled,\nspluttering load of bullshit about how\nyou somehow did something incredible\nlike saving an African tribe from Ebola\nwhilst furthering your dream of working\nin *insert company here*, when in reality\nyou were probably more hungover than\nCharlie Sheen on New Year\u2019s Day, nodding mindlessly to whatever the annoy-ing, chirpy one in your group said, whilst\ndreaming of a Boneless Banquet. Oh, and\nif you don\u2019t answer using the STAR tech-nique, just leave \u2013 you\u2019re done for.\nYour only option if you want any hope\nof getting the job is to spend an unending\nH\nave you ever had to endure torture? Well, I have,\nand so have you. On\nWednesday the 25th of\nJanuary, I \u2013 wait for this \u2013\nhad a haircut. If that doesn\u2019t immediately\ndraw you in, I don\u2019t know what will. I\nknow it may be a bit over the top to call\nthis torture, but bear with me.\nFirst of all, booking a haircut. That\u2019s\nharder than you may think, mainly because I\u2019m not sure the exact sentence that\nI should say when calling up. I mean, I\nknow it\u2019s not \u201cHello fine sir or madame,\nI wish to purchase one haircut, jolly\ngood show\u201d but apart from that, I\u2019m a\nbit lost. Do I say I want an appointment?\nThat seems a bit too formal and makes\nit sound like I think I\u2019m going to see a\ndoctor. Perhaps, I could just ask for a\nhaircut. That still feels somewhat lack-ing; last time I tried that there was an\nawkward silence where I think the person\non the end of the line expected me to say\nmore words. Phone\u2019s bad enough, but in\nperson is much worse. Last time I tried\nthis, it did not go well. I was walking\nconfidently, not cockily strutting mind,\nbut with the vague swagger of a man\non a mission: for I, was about to get my\nhaircut. As I opened the door, coat billowing in the wind, I suddenly started to\npanic and sweat, profusely. Shit. I hopefully thought in my head. I don\u2019t have\nan opening line. I have no way to open\nthis conversation. I know why I\u2019m here,\nthey know why I\u2019m here, what do I say. I\nthink I went with \u201cerrrrr, errrrr, haircut?\u201d\nA regular James Bond, I know.\nYou\u2019re sat down in a chair and then\nasked what you want done with it, at\nwhich point you fumble around for an\nexplanation that matches the image in\nyour head. When you finally decide on\nthe style you have the \u201cThis much? No,\nokay, this much? How about this much?\u201d\nat which point you usually just say yes as\nyou don\u2019t want to be too much bother and\nmake a fuss. Although inside you\u2019re terrified they\u2019re about to chop off way more\nthan has been agreed.\nHair wet, person with sharp objects\nnear your neck, suspended in a chair beneath a layer of protection from the spill\nof stuff being cut off you: this is when the\nreal torture is about to start. It\u2019s a tense\nmoment, worthy of any Bond scene. \u201cDo\nyou expect me to talk?\u201d \u201cNo, Mr Arbabzadah, I expect you to make cheerful\nsmall talk, and look as if you\u2019re not secretly regretting the length you\u2019re letting\nme cut off\u201d. Maybe I\u2019m slightly exag-gerating, it\u2019s not that bad talking, but it\ncan be a bit awkward. Especially when,\nafter seeing the amount of hair falling on\nthe floor and how it\u2019s starting to shape\nup, you\u2019re making a face akin to a deer\nin the headlights. There\u2019s also the classic\nmoment when you realise that you had\nspaced out, trying to tell yourself that it\u2019s\nokay as you\u2019re only half way through\nand it will look totally different when fin-numbers of hours, scratching your head\ntrying to remember anything you ever\ndid that was vaguely impressive, relating\nthem to competencies like \u201cMakes An\nImpact\u201d and \u201cGets Things Done\u201d. Those\nridiculous statements are genuinely\ntwo of the competencies for a very well\nknown bank by the way; I\u2019m not making them, or the grammatically incorrect\ncapitalisation, up. They\u2019re also incredibly\nboring for people on both sides of the ta-ble: the interviewer regurgitates a bunch\nof questions from a piece of paper and\nyou regurgitate some prepared answers.\nIt\u2019s likeA-Levels where you won\u2019t get the\nmarks unless you put in the key words.\nIt\u2019s a state of affairs that hasn\u2019t escaped\nthe attention of employers. Several, including Ernst and Young, one of the Big\n4, who are collectively perhaps the oldest\nand greatest advocates of competency in-You think JP Morgan interviews are bad, you should do one for the Daily\nMail. You have to shout incoherently about the latest hot button issue\n... the interviewer\nregurgitates a\nbunch of questions\nfrom a piece of\npaper and you\nregurgitate some\nprepared answers\n\u201d\nsome\nsome\nswers\nswers\n\u201c\n... the in\n... the i\nregurgit\nregurgit\nterviews, are moving to alternatives such\nas strength based interviews, which are\ndesigned to find what really motivates\npeople, their true strengths and whether\nthese make them suitable for the role.\nMany industries could also learn a lot\nfrom consultancy firms who frequently\nuse case interviews. These test the candidate\u2019s ability to solve a pseudo-real world\nproblem, actively testing the same skills\nneeded for the actual job. It\u2019s a shame that\nthese days to succeed in almost anything,\nfrom exams to interviews, there are few\nalternatives but to learn the script and follow it to a T. I guess it\u2019s better than being\nunemployed in a ditch, drinking K Cider,\nwhich is apparently what the legions of\nunemployed graduates are doing now\naccording to the Daily Mail. Anyway, I\ngotta go guys, I have to think of times I\n\u201cdrove things forward in a team\u201d\u2026\nished, and had been asked a simple direct\nquestion. That\u2019s when you go into full\nback-in-school-teacher-has-picked-onme-I-wasn\u2019t-listening mode and forget\nthat, as an adult, you can just say that you\ndidn\u2019t hear as a dryer drowned them out.\nNext comes the big reveal. It\u2019s all been\nleading up to this point and\u2026 fuck, (as\nI have to mix up my swear words a bit,\nI need a plethora of options to choose\nfrom) this is not exactly as I had planned\nit. Crap, (see, mixing it up) this doesn\u2019t\nlook quite as good as it did in my head.\nWhy exactly did I make myself so handsome in my head; that was a terrible idea.\nIt seems they have cut it how I wanted,\nbut my own face and head has let me\ndown. At this point, you realise that, ac-tually, it\u2019s always like this. It\u2019ll take a few\ndays or so for it to grow out and adopt the\nstyle you were aiming for. By the time it\ndoes, you\u2019ll be used to it and all will be\nfine. Panic over, disaster averted.

    "content": "\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto on music as a futile\ninterrogation of the state of the world\nNo exit from reality\nM\nusic, like all art, is a creative outlet addressing two\ndomains: affronting reality\nand escaping it. The first\ncan be witnessed in the efforts of the punk movement to criticize the values of modern society, or as a means of raising\nawareness and capital for charitable causes.\nThe second aims to create an alternative real-ity, an escape from the mundane, numbing the\nferocity of practical life.\nParadoxically, even while directly addressing current affairs, a medium such as music\ncan\u2019t help but recede into the latter category.\nWhat good will shouting about police brutality or state control do to those living under\noppressive government? Likewise, the measurable benefit of an event such as Live Aid is\nas questionable as a token donation to Unicef.\nInsofar as it acts as a medium of expression\nand an open stage for personal opinions, the\nfreedom procured by this creative vessel has\nmany benefits for individual and communal\nwell-being. Unfortunately, much like a picket\nline in the middle of nowhere, ultimately little\nfruit will come of it unless it is directed in a\ncalculated and scrupulous way. Given the vanity of mainstream media, especially when it\ncomes to the arts, the only way of getting a\nmessage to the masses would be to infiltrate\nthe very system which censors sound opinions\nfor lack of marketability or for being too offensive to force upon the majority of consumers.\nLike any organised protest, unless the initiative\nattains a critical mass, it will either fall on deaf\nears or slip under the noisy radar altogether.\nLady Gaga\u2019s meat dress was about as subversive as it was offensive. While at least an\nadmirable attempt to protest animal cruelty,\nher own exhibitionism managed to stifle her\nintentions. It was seen by most as just another\noutlandish dress from her eccentric wardrobe.\nHad she started an affiliate clothing line with\na corporate butcher, perhaps the press would\nhave clung on for a few days longer. However\nworn in public, would likely have her arrested\nin certain parts of the world.\nMetal is an interesting genre on opposite\ncounts. While psychedelic music is all about\ntaking drugs and outlandishly redefining the human condition, metal is perhaps the archetypal\ngenre of honest fantasy. Singing about dragons\nand muscular women wielding swords of steel\nwill never bring them about, but in some cases\nleaving imagination as a willful illusion may be\nthe only viable escape from reality.\nOne subgenre which seemed to miss this existential loophole altogether is black metal, the\nSatanic cousin of the hairy-chested longhairs.\nPredominantely a Scandinavian phenomenon,\nthe alienated youths behind the movement mistakenly wore the veil of Satanism as an shocking cover for their people\u2019s plight in preserving\nthe pagan culture destroyed by Christianisation.\nSurely a poorly chosen guise, given the trivial\ndiabolisation of such strategies by the media.\nThey might have been more successful in their\nattempts to stand up for national dignity by saying it with a straight face rather than painting\nthemselves like Kiss and putting on an evil gri-mace. It\u2019s a pity their burning of churches was\nseen as an act of malevolence rather than the\nrighteous reclamation of pagan holy land they\nintended. This insular norwegian episode was\nan interesting and often confusing example of\nfantasy infringing upon reality, to the point of\nsabotaging its own intentions.\nEven in misleading circumstances, the vociferous agitations aroused by mere waves in\nair are at least commendable for their initiative\nand occasional integrity, however futile an attempt may be to make a difference in a largely\nindifferent society.\nAs Gil Scott-Heron prophesied, \u201cthe revolution will not be televised, it will be live.\u201d\nUltimately, change must happen in the minds\nof the people. Only then will it become manifest in the real world. In this sense, perhaps the\nquiet character of this ghostly medium may\nfind a place in our flickering existence after all.\na public paragon of truism this episode might\nhave felt to her, I doubt any furry animals were\nspared from the high street.\nMusic alone may not stir great upheaval, but\nit\u2019s grounding in the sublime has greater power\nthan most to affect our mood and our disposition to behave or act in certain ways. However indirectly, it is this through this character\nthat it may cause veritable change in the real\nworld. The subjective nature of music, as with\nany other medium of free expression, makes\nit difficult to obtain tangible, objective results.\nNonetheless, it is this abstraction which allows\nit to touch far more profoundly the complexion\nof individuals, driving them to action.\nThe emotional charge of a piece of music\ncan awaken or invigorate passions in people\nthat may cause evident impressions in the\nlives of others. To this end, it should not be\nseen as a primary agent for change but rather\nas a stimulant.\nThe power of music may be exploited as a\nplatform for propaganda or an enticement into\naction. With a decent enough backing track,\nvirtually any message may be forced on the\nna\u00efve or subservient listener. All it takes is a\ncatchy melody and an explicit beat to leave\nthe world at your feet, hanging on your every word, regardless of how false, immoral\nor ridiculous your claims may be. In a world\nwhere sexual inequality and stereotypes run\never rampant, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Girls (Who Run\nthe World)\u2019 couldn\u2019t be any more misguided.\nWhether the lyrics \u201cwho run this motha?\u201d refer to Mother Earth or someone else, she seems\nto have dropped way out of her depth. All the\nwhile perplexingly dressed in a fashion that, if\nWhat better way to wave goodbye to week 4 than\nwith a timely fix of post-hardcore goodness. This\nweek, I\u2019ll be telling you all about Every Time I Die.\nAs was the case with the second lesson\u2019s band,\nRefused, Every Time I Die doesn\u2019t strictly belong\nto the post-hardcore genre but for anyone following this column, this band cannot be missed.\nAs a product of the New York alternative music\nscene, Every Time I Die has a strong hardcore\ninfluence present in their sound but they have a\nvast platter of extra offerings too. Frontman Keith\nBuckley adopts the gruff vocal style of hardcore\npunk but in some tracks does show off his more\ngentle side with melodic tunes sure to get stuck\nin your head. A prime example of this is in the\nsong \u2018Wanderlust\u2019 from their most recent album\nNew Junk Aesthetic. I am almost certain that some\nweird voodoo magic has gone into the track because it is literally always in my head. That being\nsaid, it\u2019s a pleasure to have such a great piece of\nmusic as an imaginary friend.\nAs I mentioned earlier, they are not strictly post-hardcore and this is evident when they are compared to other bands in this series. As opposed to\nthe unpredictable and choppy music of Glassjaw\nand At The Drive-In, Every Time I Die do not infuse this kind of underlying asymmetry into the essence of their music. Their sound is more (for lack\nof a much better word) conventional, without the\nstrange time signatures and noise experiments.\nBut this shouldn\u2019t be taken the wrong way. Every\nTime I Die never fail to create a phenomenal album with every part of their back catalogue being\nas good if not better than the last. Every time they\nrelease a new record, I always get the feeling that\nthey cannot top their previous release and so I\nalways think the new one will be a let down, but\nit never is!\nFor this reason, I urge you to buy their upcoming\nalbum Ex-Lives (out 6th March) as I would not be at\nall surprised if it is their best\u2026 so far. Remember\nto check out the recommendation and see you all\nnext week!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendation\nListen to the song \u2018Wanderlust\u2019, although I warn\nyou, it will get stuck in your head for the rest of\nyour life.\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nLesson 4: Every Time I Die\nMUSIC\nFELIX Friday 03 February 2012 21\nDisney\u2019s Lost Control\nBe sure not to miss...\nJ Dilla revolutionised hip-hop\nby taking the glory back from the\nrhymes to the beats.

    "content": "At first sight an event that describes itself as\nan open mic poetry night may not seem like\nsomething everyone can enjoy. You may even\nassume that it, and by extension anyone writing about it, will be pretentious; perhaps you\nthink it will be the sort of night where somebody without a beret would be persona non\ngrata (see, not pretentious, quod erat demonstrandum\u2026 too meta a joke?). I can assure\nyou, Fluent on Paper is not at all like that.\nThe atmosphere was incredibly friendly,\nwarm and encouraging. As well as having\nthree guest poets, anybody could go up and\nread their poetry. It didn\u2019t matter if someone\nhad written their poem on the night, or had\ncarefully honed it over several months. Those\nwho did work up the nerve to step up to the mic\nand recite their poetry found a polite, receptive\nand attentive audience waiting for them.\nThe poems themselves ranged from introspective musings to a lighter, comic tone \u2013 like\nstand-up comedy, but with rhymes. The three\nset poets were all great. Chris Richardson\n(aka Felix\u2019s Travel Editor) read stories of his\nvarious travels, including one written in fairly\nharsh conditions in a desert. Cas Nadel read\nquirky poems in her unique, semi-rap style.\nDylan Lowe (a travel writer and former Felix\nTravel Editor) continued on a theme of travel\nat the end of the night.\nThe organiser of the night, Kadhim Shubber, was, much like a curious man at a urinal,\ncompering. As well as introducing the three\nset poets, he read some of his own material;\nmy personal favourite was \u2018The Politician\u2019s\nFingernails\u2019, written about an image obsessed\npolitician who is frantically worrying about\nwhether or not his fingernails are too long.\nAt some point in the night, Kadhim also\nintroduced what became somewhat of an impromptu theme. A friend, who I shall not further embarrass by naming, was trying to give\nup smoking. People were encouraged to write\na poem (see Haiku in The Poet\u2019s Column) for\nhim to gently help him to persevere. They were\nmostly humorous in nature, with the exception\nof one slightly more harrowing offering. In\nfact, I even braved the spotlight and read out\na (slightly unconventionally structured, read:\npoorly structured) poem to help convince him.\nOverall the evening was very enjoyable, and\na great way to spend a relaxing Sunday night.\nFluent on Paper at The Builders Arms at\nmonthly intervals \u2013 the next is on Sunday\n19 February\nFELIX\nFriday 03 february 2012\n18\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\nARTS\nFluent on Paper does\nThe Poet\u2019s Column\nTourists\nby Cas Nadel\nStupid fucking tourists getting in the way,\nwhy don\u2019t you learn to ride the mother fucking\ntrain?\nGawking at the signs squiggly lines unrefined \u2013\ncan\u2019t find the stop you\u2019re looking for;\nlurching on the floor.\nMissing the door by a hair, unaware:\nstep out in front, elbow in naval \u2013 grunt.\nYou\u2019re liable and unreliable, unpliable \u2013\nthere\u2019s a Burberry on every high street in your\ncountry.\nWhat\u2019s the need to not proceed,\npreceding me so slowly?\nWe\u2019re not running hourly \u2013 minutes count.\nPounds are always on the line, we\u2019re running by\nthe time,\nwound up like a clockwork Turk \u2013\nthe system has to work!\nIf you stop to tie your shoe, the bottle blocks -wear crocks!\nTearing me asunder and I wonder \u201cwhere\u2019re your\nbrains?\u201d\nDid you leave them on the plane or with security?\nHe asked if you packed your bags yourself and\nauto mode turned on and now on Portobello Road\nyou\u2019re slow -pacing like a toad, stopping, starting, a bitch for\nany of us passing, asking which side will you step -a never ending guess!\nGo back from whence you came I\u2019ve got nothing\n\u2018gainst those who can move and realise there are\nothers in the world with even less to prove than\nyou so remove your shoes, let us tread on your\ncalcaneus.

Move the fuck out my\nway!\nUntitled Haiku\nby Dylan Lowe\nSwirling smoke inhaled\nInnocent gale it may seem\nIt fucks up your lungs\nTim Arbabzadah\nLooking\ngood on\nPaper\nEva Rosenthal\nThe ease with which Ido, protagonist of The\nBee, morphs from law-abiding and rather boring businessman \u2013 of the kind who present\ntheir sons with calculators for their 6th birthday \u2013 to terrorising monster is stupefying but\naltogether not far removed from reality. After\nall, murderers lead at least some semblance of\na \u2018normal\u2019 life up until that fateful murderous\nday. Perhaps it was because of this knowledge\nthat The Bee made for such unsettling viewing.\nWhen his family is kidnapped, Ido refuses to\nplay the victim and takes the kidnappers\u2019 wife\nand son as hostages. What was initially a matter of revenge on Ogoro, the stammering escapee murderer who wants his wife back, soon\ndescends into cold sickening pleasure for Ido.\nJarringly bright lights, blood-red floors and\nscreaming Japanese music set the mood at\nthe Soho Theatre for this chilling comedy, a\ncollaborative effort by Hideki Noda OBE and\nColin Teevan. They have mingled hilarity with\nhorror; The Bee is both funny and vaguely\nterrifying. The script has a discordant aspect:\nthe sentences are brief, rhyming occasionally,\nresulting in a terseness broken only by sound\neffects of varying degrees of irritation. Combined with the strident tone of delivery used by\nthe four actors, the script imposes its disturbed\nidea on the audience members, who cannot\nhelp but laugh even when, for example, Ido is\ncutting a third finger off the little boy hostage.\nFour actors played ten characters: there\nwas much, and impressive, gender bending of\nroles. Olivier Award winning actress Kathryn\nHunter was the sociopathic Ido; the repugnant\naura that the character exudes from the start\nwas a stroke of real inspiration. The useless\npolice inspector, who has the task of delivering\nIdo\u2019s and Ogoro\u2019s messages of escalating vio-lence, was played by Clive Mendus. Mendus\nwas also responsible for a telephone ringtone\nof dizzyingly irritating proportions \u2013 earplugs\nwould have been a good idea for this particular moment. Glyn Pritchard metamorphosed\nseamlessly from misogynistic detective Anchoku to Ogoro\u2019s son and eventually to Ogoro\nHip to Bee square\nhimself. These metamorphoses were choreographed with astuteness: Pritchard, confident\nas the loud-mouthed Anchoku, takes a bat\nto the head when Ido loses his patience with\npolice procedure. He keels over and as Ido\ndrags an imaginary body away, Pritchard dons\na green cap and with scared eyes, instantly\nbecomes Ogoro\u2019s terrified son. Ogoro\u2019s wife\nis a pitiable character, played with surprising\nsex-appeal and femininity by Hideki Noda, the\nwriter himself. The wife is forced into submission by Ido and by the end barely complains\nagainst the bestiality flung upon her.\nThe acting and staging are both impeccable,\nbut The Bee fails to entirely come together on\nsome fundamental level, This is perhaps be-cause, while the hilarity and horror succeed\nas individual characteristics of The Bee, they\nare never effectively welded together and\nat times even cancel each other out. Neither\ncharacteristic was emphasised with sufficient\nstrength in the script, both falling slightly flat,\nand unable to create a vivid enough impression on the viewer. The play, with its aggravating reporters and useless police force, is\nalready something of a caricature of society; a\ngreater degree of exaggeration would not have\nhurt it. In spite of this, The Bee entertains and\neven poses some interesting questions about\nthe more abominable depths of human nature.\nAt just over an hour in length, it would be the\nperfect start to an evening out in Soho, providing at the very least a wealth of material for\ndiscussion.\nThe Bee at the Soho Theatre until February 11th. Student tickets from \u00a317.50\n\u201cJarringly bright lights,\nblood-red floors and\nscreaming Japanese music set the mood\u201d\nIs it a guy? Is it a girl? One way to find out!\nGuys play girls and girls play guys in\ncomically dark Japanese kidnapping\nFelix Arts is constantly\nlooking for new poets.\nIf you want to see your\nwork appearing here, do\nget in touch.\n\n"

    "content": "Making a difference in Malawi\nS\neptember 2011: From the\nair, it looked like a leopard\u2019s\ncoat: hills of dry grass were\ndotted with random dark\nspots of green mango trees\nand large boulders. I landed in the capital of Malawi, Lilongwe, at the peak of\nthe dry season in south eastern Africa.\nIndependent since 1964, and democratic since 1994, Malawi is a landlocked country of 15.5 million people,\nnestled between Mozambique, Zambia\nand Tanzania. Running from North to\nSouth along the Great Rift Valley.\nMalawi enjoys a healthy wildlife and\nstunning diverse landscapes with flat\nplains, woodlands, wetlands, rainfor-ests, and mountains up to 3,000m tall.\nIts eponymous lake, with warm crystal\nclear water and sandy beaches, is part of\nthe lives of many Malawians whether it\nis for daily use, fishing, tourism or for\n98% of its hydro-based electricity. Nevertheless, with only 6% of the population having access to power, an average life expectancy of just 50 years, an\nHIV/AIDS rate of 12%, and 65% of the\npopulation below the poverty line, statistics unfortunately rank Malawi among\nthe world\u2019s least-developed countries:\n171/187.\nIn the days following my arrival, these\ncold, hard facts about Malawi\u2019s difficulties were quickly overshadowed by the\nexceptional kindness and friendliness of\nMalawians. Among them are the memLo\u00efc Baboulaz makes his mark on the Malawian healthcare system\n\u201c...truly one of my\ngreatest and most\nmemorable experiences\u201d\nbers of Baobab Health Trust, a Malawian\norganization delivering medical informatics solutions to hospitals and clinics\nacross Malawi. I noticed the office of\nBaobab Health one day while driving in\nLilongwe and I met with founder Gerry\nDouglas to offer to work as a volunteer.\nThe next day, and for the next three\nmonths, I worked at Baobab Health and\nwas in charge of three projects related to\nimage processing and electronics. Working for a Malawian NGO with Malawians engineers and for Malawians\u2019 interests was truly one of my greatest and\nmost memorable experiences.\nCreated in the USA in 2000, and officially Malawian since 2008, Baobab\nHealth is replacing Malawi\u2019s traditional\npaper-based system of medical records\nwith an electronic system in hospitals\nand clinics, with the goal of improving healthcare delivery and reducing its\ncosts through better planning. In Malawi, there is on average one doctor for\n50 000 people (versus 400 in Europe and\nthe USA) so the task of collecting and\nupdating medical records is usually assigned to health workers with no computer experience. Also, nurses and low-skilled clinicians provide most of the\nhealthcare to people and would benefit\ngreatly from a clinical decision support\nsystem for medical diagnosis. Existing\nmedical informatics solutions from the\nWestern world are not adapted to emerging countries like Malawi, so engineers\nat Baobab Health have developed their\nown open-source software and custom\nhardware solutions by stripping down a\ncomputer to its bare essentials: a touch-screen, no keyboard and an intuitive,\nhighly optimized, user-interface that\nguides clinical practitioners through\neach task (registration, diagnosis, pre-scription) while also preventing error\nentries.. The result is a much more accurate and faster data collection that benefits both patients and doctors, but also\nthe nation in helping making policies\nand planning drug purchase.\nMalawi is a low-resource and challenging environment for deploying\nmodern IT technology. Power cuts, communication network outage and chronic\nfuel shortages regularly affect main hos-pitals. Health centres in the countryside\nreaching most of the population are simply out of all grids. To overcome these\nproblems, Baobab Health finds innovative and sustainable solutions with customized workstations, low-power serv-ers, alternative sources of energy and\ncontinuous power backup. This allows\nan HIV clinic to run with three touchscreen workstations, three label print-ers, a network switch and a server for\nless power than a single 100-watt light\nbulb. Engineers also set up their own\ncommunication antennas to interconnect\nthe different centres for monitoring, support or service delivery. Baobab Health\ncan pride itself on having, in its system,\n1.5 million patients registered across 23\nsites and over 122 000 patients on antiretroviral therapy.\nI first heard of Baobab Health in the\nbook The Boy Who Harnessed The\nWind. It tells the remarkable story of\nWilliam Kamkwamba, a young 14-year-old Malawian boy, who had dropped out\nof school. Using books from the library\nand parts from a scrapyard, he managed\nto build his own windmill to power his\nfamily house. Baobab Health helped to\nspread the word of his engineering talents at a TED conference in 2007. From\nthat moment, William Kamkwamba\nbecame a media sensation and is now\nable to pursue his studies in the USA.\nThis extraordinary and inspiring story\nis sadly unknown to most Malawians\nand its youths who desperately need role\nmodels and encouragement to believe in\nthemselves and their future.\nEmerging countries can benefit tremendously from new technologies, provided that they are carefully adapted to\nthe particular needs and issues of each\nregion. I left Malawi during the rainy\nseason and the land was then covered\nwith lush, green vegetation: it had transformed itself as much as Baobab Health\nhas transformed my vision of engineer-ing.\nA rural landscape in Malawi\nJoining a Malawian primary school for the day\nTRAVEL\nFELIX\nFriday 03 february 2012\n36\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel Editors: Dushi Arumuganesan\nChris Richardson\n\u201c...Baobab Health, a Malawian organization delivering medical informatics solutions...\u201d\n\u201c...Baobab Health\nhas transformed my\nvision of engineering\u201d\n\n"

Luckily to plug this huge hole in our\nback four, we had our team captain B. Man\nBriggs, and esteemed fresher Meatspin coming in from right and left back respectively\ninto the centre.\nWe came out of the blocks early and fast.\nSome great passing down the right and left\nwings led to the some great attacking plays.\nSPORT\nFELIX\nFriday 03 february 2012\n46\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editors: Indy Leclercq\nDavid Wilson\nWeb: www3.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nFacebook: Search \u2018Sport Imperial\u2019\nTwitter: @SportImperial\nWithin the first ten minutes our infamous\n70% defensive press paid off and Dirty\nWhaler pilfered the ball from under the nose\nof the Roehampton left-back, promptly passing it to the newly bar-named Captain Slow\nwho was lingering on the baseline. Some\nsilky skills into their circle later, he pulled a\npass back to Fresher Joe who slotted it into\nthe goal past their keeper.\nHaving poked our noses in front, we revelled in being awarded yet more short corners in their circle\u2013 however our esteemed\ncorner striker C. Bell fired blanks and we\nwere unable to capitalise on the proverbial\ncampsite we had set up around their goal.\nConsistently we were again unable to\nuse the huge amounts of possession or the\nterritory we kept gaining by pressing their\ndefensive lines, which is something we\nshould definitely work on at future training\nsessions. It took a breakaway counterattack\nby Roehampton\u2019s sneaky centre midfielder\nto shoot towards goal, forcing an excellent\nsave from Glory Hole. The ball fell to B.\nMan Briggs and in classic defensive fashion,\nhe spanked the ball into a Roehampton player\u2019s ankle. The umpire rightly gave a free hit\nto Imperial, despite the howls of pain of the\nRoehampton striker. At this point we experienced an interlude in play, while we waited\nfor an ambulance to turn up. After half an\nhour of waiting around with icepacks, tinfoil\nand warm clothes, however, the ambulance\nnever arrived due to the injury apparently\nnot being severe enough to merit one and he\nwas carried off the pitch by his teammates.\nIronically, the same injured Roehampton\nplayer actually broke his thumb the last time\nhe played us at the beginning of last term.\nThe second half was pretty much yet more\nImperial domination, with some moments\nof brilliance by Roehampton\u2019s midfielders\nmore than matched by Soggy Biscuit\u2019s magic tackle at the back. This is also when the\nhalf an hour \u201cbreak\u201d started to take its toll on\nus. As Dirty Whaler noted in his post-match\ncomments, it was due to the accumulation\nof Christmas-induced layers of fat. A couple\nof members of the team such as Yellowbag\nseized up with cramp, leaving us to play Total Hockey, constantly switching in and out\nof each others\u2019 positions in midfield.\nTowards the end, IC experienced a barrage of attacks and short corners, and it was\na tribute to our strength and depth that our\nsolid sellotaped makeshift defence held out\nto the finish line. Eventually the game finished with the score at 1-0 to Imperial, and\nour unbeaten record in the BUCS league was\nfurther cemented.\nMen\u2019s 2nd 1\nRoehampton 0\nHe can shoot faster than his own shadow.

Unfortunately this led\nto it being cut. They took student\nconcerns into consideration. The\nstudy concluded whatever the\npeople who conducted the study\nwanted to conclude. A focus group\nwas even used. Completely fair, im-partial, and definitely not leading,\nquestions were asked. These consisted of deep, intense questioning\nsuch as: \u201cWould you like to be on an\neven better campus?\u201d It turned out,\nwhen you ask this everyone replied\nyes! Luckily, this was enough to justify moving to a different campus\nand re-branding.\nImperial Training Academy for\nBanking, Management and Consulting, as it shall henceforth be\nknown, will be, fittingly, moving to\nthe City. Widespread anger about\nthe move has been appeased by el\nPresidente as he said that all was\nokay because everyone has been\ngiven free iPads.\nThe change will also coincide with\nbroad changes across the board in\ncurriculum. The vocational side of\ncourses is to be largely expanded.\nLabs will be carried out in groups\nso students will always have an example of a \u201ctime they worked in a\ngroup\u201d. To add to that, students will\nbe forced to do spreadsheets for 16\nhours straight while full of cocaine\nand coffee; this change will simulate investment banking accurately.\nThe content of lectures will also be\ncut and some courses will be entirely removed. Lecturers will be notified by e-mail.\nIt\u2019s not all looking like bad news,\nthere will be lectures in consulting,\nensuring students \u201cactually know\nwhat the fuck consulting really\nmeans\u201d.\nIn other news, The Dinner Lady\u2019s\nhouse was a bit shit and needed im-provement. The dining room needed to be made much better. She\ndecided, wisely, that the best way\nto do this was to buy a new house.\nNone were available, so she just\nfound the owners of a nice house\nand is trying to kick them out. The\nDinner Lady is going to try to raise\nfunds by having a large, clear-out\nsale.

Mr\nParmar publicly announced the\nfairly uncontroversial news via his\nFacebook account on the evening\nof the 28th January.\nMr Parmar said that he is \u201cResigning as dpe- sick and tired of\nbureaucracy and red tape....noth-ing ever gets done around here and\nit\u2019s sickening the amount of money\nwasted/ embezzled by the supposed figureheads of our student\nbody. I just want Britain to be back\nBritish!!!!\u201d [sic].\nInsider sources believe that this\nwas an inevitable outcome after Mr\nParmar was seen at a local Orange\nstore speaking with the store\u2019s man-ager. Upon his resignation, Mr Parmar was seen to be working at the\naforementioned phone shop as an\nOrange Nokia sales representative.\nAfter speaking with the Onion\nPresidente, Scott Heath, about how\nthis would affect his plans for the\nrest of the year, Heath said \u201cI think\nwe can now safely guarantee students the best possible mobile con-tract, in what is sure to be a bright\nfuture..\u201d\nWhen Hangman contacted the office of the only other Orange representative associated with the College, The Dinner Lady, we received\nno response.\nIt is unknown whether the actions\nof Mr Parmar will spark any kind of\nreaction from the student body as\nof yet. However militant groups of\npostgraduates have begun to form\nin the dark recesses of the College.\nOne group of Civil Engineering\nPhD students posted a video on\nYouTube, demanding that \u201cuntil\nthe bureaucracy and red tape at\nthe Onion is eradicated... (they)\nwill do no work.\u201d\nThe Iron Lady (who has no affiliations with the faculty of Engineering) offered an official viewpoint\non the situation.

After years of watching\nour illegitimate children run amok\nwith what was once the glorious\nsatire section of an obscure student\nnewspaper, the Hangman team of\nold have come back with a hostile\nacquisition. Sure we whacked a guy,\nsure we set a cat on fire, but isn\u2019t it\nworth it? That was rhetorical, because the obvious answer is yes! In\nfact we\u2019re back as Hangman 2.0.

Besides, women\nare lucky to have you there to protect\nthem. It\u2019s not like they could stick up\nfor themselves or even take a joke.\nThey could never engage in, obviously light-hearted, \u2018banter\u2019 as fuck-wits refuse to not call it.\nIf you\u2019re still with us, then be sure\nto cut out the glossary on the next\npage. This handy list will help you\nkeep up with the \u201cactors\u201d we pay ridiculously high salaries to run the col-lege.

Someone told\nme they weren\u2019t actors but are in reality real people doing real jobs to pay\nfor their second home in France.

They\nalso admitted to publishing six \u201cfake\u201d\njournals, existing purely to print articles\nfavourable to products by the drug giant\nMerck & Co. In 2009, the BBC also accused Elsevier of \u201cshill reviewing\u201d by\npaying academics who contributed to a\npsychology book if they gave it 5 star reviews on popular book-selling websites.\nThe company later attributed this to an\nemployee error.\nHowever, Professor Gowers\u2019 post\ndeals with something a lot more fundamental \u2013 the access to publicly funded\nresearch. He details four criticisms\n(amongst many) that lead to his choice to\npublicly boycott the company.\nHis first complaint is with Elsevier\u2019s\npolicy of making libraries subscribe to\njournal \u201cbundles\u201d. This forces them to\nsubscribe to hundreds of journals, many\nof which being unwanted and of little\ninterest, should just a few core titles be\ndesired. Professor Gowers cited an example of the Fractals journal being one\nthat many libraries end up subscribing to\nout of necessity, even with its dubious\nintegrity.\nThis is in addition to his complaint\nof \u201cextraordinary\u201d high costs. Journal\nprices have increased yearly, squeezing already tightened library budgets. In\n2011, Felix reported how the Director\nof Library Services at Imperial College,\nDeborah Shorley, is leading a campaign\nby Research Libraries UK to pressure\npublishers such as Elsevier and Wiley to\nreduce subscription costs. Imperial College Union subsequently passed a policy\ndemanding that these publishers cut the\nprices on their products. These price\nincreases occur regardless of massive\nincreases in profits \u2013 in 2009, Elsevier\nmade a turnover of \u00a31.6bn; up from \u00a31bn\nin 2005.\nProfessor Gowers went on to say that\nlibraries can find their access to Elsevier\njournals cut off if they attempt to negotiate a better contract, something he calls\n\u201cruthless\u201d.\nHe is also concerned about Elsevier\u2019s\nsupport of the Research Works Act, a\npiece of legislation in United States Congress which would remove free access to\npublicly funded research. This bill was\nthat this was a matter for lecturers, say-ing, \u201cAll researchers should think carefully about where they publish and for\nwhom they review. They are providing\nfree resources and services, and they\nshould consider whether the companies\nthey publish with have values that are\naligned with those of the academy or\nnot.\u201d\nHowever, she did acknowledge that\nthe costs of Elsevier journals have been\na problem, with concern over the charges and licensing policies being had for\n\u201cmany years\u201d. She did note, however,\nthat these are with a number of publishers and not just Elsevier.\nThis is not a decision that academics\ntake lightly. Speaking to Felix, Dr Paula\nSaldago from Imperial\u2019s NMR facility\nsaid \u201cAs an early career researcher, [...]\nnot choosing to publish or review for\nthose journals can have a serious impact\non the careers of less established scientists.\u201d\nRegardless of the Elsevier boycott and\ndisapproval of the practices of for-profit\npublishers in general, there is no negative feeling about the future. Instead,\nmany feel that this is an opportunity to\nrevolutionize how journals are handled.\nA notable example of this is the arXiv\npreprint server, ran by Cornell University, though articles on this server are not\npeer reviewed. There are also publishers\nsuch as Mathematical Sciences Publishers who operate on a non-profit basis; an\norganization that Dr Brini feels may be\nthe way to go.\nThere are other options too. Dr \u0141ukasz\nsaid \u201cI very much hope that the future\nlies within community-run journals (con-cerning the actual work which is done,\nall the journals are community-run any-way), and printing will be outsourced to\nprint-on-demand companies\u201d citing the\nexample of American upstart Scholastica.\nHowever, the most radical solution is\nproposed by Dr Saldago: \u201cI believe it\nis time to change the current scientific\npublications trend and support open access journals and initiatives that allow\nsharing and open discussions of data and\nresults.\u201d Mrs Shorley added that it will\nbe extremely interesting to see how these\nprogress.\nAcademics have voiced their disapproval with Elsevier\u2019s methods\nCarol Ann Cheah\nPhilip Kent\nAlexander Karapetian\nsince 2006\u201d. Predictably in the current\neconomic climate, there was a greater\ndecrease in applications from the 21-24\nage group than from school-leavers.\nUnfortunately the number of applications still exceeds the number of places\nthat are available in 2012. According to\nCook\u2019s statement \u201cApplications are already 50,000 ahead of the number of acceptances in 2011.\u201d The fact that last year\nUCAS received a further 116,000 applications between January and the close of\nthe cycle is further cause for concern.\nPro-Rector (Education) Professor Julia\nBuckingham said of the decrease: \u201cWe\nwill want to go beyond the statistics of\nthis particular year to carefully monitor application trends as we go forward\nunder the new system. One area for the\nwhole sector to consider is whether universities can communicate their student\nfinance packages even more widely in\nthe future. Here at Imperial, for instance,\nwe have a generous financial support\npackage so that the costs of studying are\nnot a barrier to students joining us, and\nwe are working to ensure that message\nreaches prospective students as they start\nto consider their options post A-Level.\u201d\nInterestingly subscription to arts degrees has been affected to a greater extent\nthan the sciences. One could argue that\nthis goes some way in explaining why\napplications to Imperial have not suffered much. Imperial\u2019s invariable appeal\nto overseas students may also be a contributing factor as there was an increase\nin the number of applications from applicants outside the EU of 13.7% (although\nthe number of EU applicants decreased).\nStudents and staff alike might expect\nImperial\u2019s excellent reputation to have\nplayed a role in maintaining the application rate this year in comparison to other\nUK universities, an Imperial degree perhaps being considered worth the higher\nfees.\n...Continued from Front Page\nDrop in applications\nto Imperial\nImperial saw a 0.1% decrease in applications from 2011 to 2012\nChristian Richters\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nGet ready for the craziest, most intense,\nand unforgettable ride of this year. Yes,\nPolanski\u2019s latest Carnage is a force to\nbe reckoned with; which is odd, mostly\nbecause of its incredibly modest running time (79 minutes), small cast (four\nkey characters), single set (a New York\napartment), and what appears to be a\nstraightforward plot. But based on the\nTony Award winning play God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza, this is a deceptively simple film that has so much\nenergy and power to dish out, even in\nits tiny scale. So get ready \u2013 for a hot-tempered, scream-filled, foul-mouthed,\nalcohol-fuelled, vomit-covered (yes,\nreally) experience that will be hard to\nresist.\nIn a brief prologue set in contemporary New York, we see an 11-year-old\nZachary pick up a stick and swing it in\nNathan\u2019s face, which results in bruising,\nswelling and two teeth being knocked\nout. Zachary\u2019s parents, Nancy (Winslet)\nmake up the cast pull out all the stops\nand ferociously attack one another as\nthe meltdown occurs. Waltz is hilarious as the smug, cavalier Alan, Winslet may seem proper and decent to start\nwith but as the atmosphere starts to spiral out of control, she drunkenly chews\nthe scenery like never before. Foster is\non the offence from the start, and she\nis the angriest, most intense one of the\nfour, which results in some dangerous\nmoments of melodramatic over-acting\ncoming from the actress, but she is\nmostly on fine form. Reilly, with his\ntowering presence, filling up almost every single shot of himself with his grand\nstature, is incredible, as he handles both\nextreme sides of his character perfectly,\nmaking that transition without any fuss.\nFor a man nearing the age of 80, Polanski doesn\u2019t show signs of slowing\ndown. He keeps the tension running\nhigh, and there is no way of knowing\nfor sure how this messy situation will\ncome to a close. Carnage is outrageous,\nshocking, yet hysterically entertaining\nwith plenty of nasty, wicked wit. With\nfour unique performances from its unbeatable cast, and under the assured\nguidance of a veteran director, this is\nmay have \u201cOscar-bait\u201d written all over\nit but no bait in the past has been this\nsavagely funny.\nThe kids are all right,\nthe adults are not\nand Alan (Waltz), are invited over by\nNathan\u2019s parents, Penelope (Foster) and\nMichael (Reilly), to discuss this situation in good faith. What was supposed\nto be a civilised, calm meeting between\nfour mature people start taking darker\nturns, as true characteristics and feelings are revealed.\nWhat makes this so agonising, yet\nirresistibly tense, is the fact that this\nencounter could have been over in min-utes. Nancy and Alan could have left\nPenelope and Michael\u2019s flat so much\nsooner. They get to as far as the eleva-tor, twice, and yet every time, they end\nup in the living room. The bitter hatred\nand unfinished business make it difficult to call it a day. It\u2019s almost perverse\nand sometimes scary to think that these\npeople cannot and refuse to leave; and\nno-one does claustrophobia better than\nPolanski. Even though this may seem a\nhighly unambitious project for a director who has made many classics over\nhis astonishing career, his attention to\ndetail is impeccable. He gets right up\nclose to his actors, and the apartment\nin which most of the film is set seems\nsizable enough, but Polanski chooses\nto remain mainly in the living room,\ncrowding his scenes with his four stars.\nSmall verbal attacks and passive-aggressive statements are the reasons\nAfter all these years, Kate finally regrets letting go of that expensive blue diamond necklace in Titanic... you\u2019re not going to find it in that bag Kate...\nFELIX Friday 03 February 2012 27\nDirector Roman Polanski\nScreenwriters Yasmina Reza (play),\nRoman Polanski\nCast Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet,\nJohn C.

    "content": "We normally think of social networks as a\nmodern-day phenomenon: Facebook, Twitter etc. come to mind. But according to recent research published in Nature, ancient\nsocieties may have been organised along\nmuch the same lines.\nIt is a popular belief that the evolution of\nhuman behaviour is all about natural selec-tion, with all our behaviours driven by the\ndesire to pass on our genes: finding a genetically fit partner and protecting our own\noffspring. However this somewhat reductive model is not the whole storwy, not least\nbecause it doesn\u2019t consider how and why we\nform friendships and cooperate with people\neven when they are not genetically related\nto us, and we don\u2019t intend to reproduce with\nthem.\nThe recent research focused on the Hadza people in Tanzania, who have a hunter-gatherer lifestyle thought to be similar to\nthat of our early human ancestors in the\nlate Pleistocene, and are relatively isolated\nfrom modern culture and technology. Two\nnetwork models were constructed, based\non who participants said they would like\nto share a camp with, and who they would\nchoose to receive a gift of honey (a prized\ndelicacy).\nOnce a social network is created, there\nare various metrics to be measured and ana-lysed. These include degree distributions\n(how many friends do you have), transitivity (how likely is it that two of your friends\nare friends themselves), degree assortativ-ity (are popular people more likely to have\npopular friends) and homophily (do similar people tend to cluster together). These\nmeasures differ from those on randomly\ngenerated networks of the same size, due\nto the human preferences underlying them.\nAdditionally they tend to form similar patterns and trends, regardless of the society\nin question, and the results for the Hadza\npopulation looked remarkably like those\nfor modern social networks. This indicates\nthat the way we form friendships and social\ngroups is hard-coded in our psychology, and\nemerged as part of our evolution as a spe-cies.\nThe researchers also offer an intriguing\nhypothesis about how human society diverged from normal primate patterns: our\nability to understand how reproduction\nworks and recognise our paternal family\nmeant we no longer had the need to enforce\n\u2018dispersal\u2019 of the young from their birthplace and family groups in order to prevent\ninadvertent in-breeding. This may have encouraged more stable groupings, increasing\nthe opportunities for friendships, and hence\nsocial networks, to form.\nHistoric social networks\nA map of social connectivity\nThe importance of social networks in our\nevolutionary history is thought to relate to\nthe development of cooperation, a distinctly\nhuman habit which allows us to go beyond\nimmediate family relationships and work\ntogether in large groups to achieve goals\nwhich benefit and advance society. In social networks, more \u2018cooperative\u2019 people\ntend to form groups \u2013 and interestingly the\nmore anti-social \u2018defectors\u2019 also tended to\nbe friends with each other.\nIt is still unclear whether this is because\ncooperators simply prefer to form links with\nlike-minded people, or whether cooperative\npeople in fact influence the friends connected to them. Either way, there is strong evidence that social networks and cooperativ-ity are closely linked, and co-evolved early\nin human history.\nDOI:10.1038/nature10736\nScientists have measured the rate at which\nquantum information travels through real\nsystems. Changes, such as those in electronic spin or energy, propagate through materials at a limited speed; similar to the speed of\nlight, this maximum theoretical limit known\nas the Lieb-Robinson bound has now been\ndetermined empirically by scientists.\nIn a material lattice like a crystal, changes at any one atom, such as flipping spin\nor nuclear decay, affect the atom\u2019s closest\nneighbours first and propagate outwards\nfrom there. The speed at which these short-range interactions occur is much lower than\nthe speed of light, but has so far been impossible to measure due to interference from\nthermal vibrations, and the sheer number of\nparticles in a real lattice make it hard to detect changes in individual atoms.\nResearchers at the Max Planck Institute\nfor Quantum Optics have devised a way of\nexperimentally measuring this value: rather\nthan using a crystalline lattice, they held a\nsupercooled monoatomic gas in an optical\nlattice: several lasers used to create standing waves in which to trap individual atoms.\nAs the atoms are not chemically bonded to\neach other and are at a very low temperature,\nmany sources of interference are eliminated\nfrom the system.\nBy changing the power of the lasers, certain atoms can be \u201cquenched\u201d \u2013 moved from\nenergetic equilibrium to an excited state.\nThese excitations then travel through the\nlattice as quantum-entangled quasiparticles\n\u2013 fictitious particles which serve as a simple\napproximation to the many complex interactions of real particles. For example, an\nelectron travelling through a semiconductor\ninteracts with each atom it encounters, but\ncan be modelled as a quasi-electron of a different mass travelling more slowly though\nfree space. By recording the time and distance between atom excitations, the speed at\nwhich these quasiparticles travel, and hence\nat which information propagates, can be\nmeasured.\nThis speed, found to be roughly twice the\nspeed of sound in the considered material,\nis currently purely empirical, and the value\ncannot be determined by theoretical meth-ods. It also is applicable only to the one-dimensional lattice under consideration, but\nas the first measurement of its kind made,\nrepresents an important step forward for research in areas such as quantum entangle-ment.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10748\nKeir Little\nFELIX\nFriday 03 February 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nQuantum information rate measured\nIn brief\nSarah Byrne\nNetworking\nby Maria Veiga\nWhen the dinosaurs disappeared, they left\nroom for mammals to go through a huge evolutionary growth spurt.

    "content": "advantage of the speed and efficiency\ngains to harness the raw power of the\nintegrated circuit and GPU.\nIf Physics is to be considered the application of Mathematics to the Universe, frequently giving us answers\nto life\u2019s questions, then Computing is\nthe application of Mathematics to the\nvirtual Universe. For instance, creating\na perfect sphere is impossible in the\nC\nomputer Science is an\noften misunderstood academic topic. Many people outside the field do\nnot perceive the breadth\nand depth of research material that\u2019s\npumped out daily and how it affects\nour everyday lives. To observe its profound effect in the real world, we must\nfirst examine the theoretical. There are\na variety of problems which are famous in mathematics. The Millennium\nPrize Problems and Hilbert\u2019s Problems\nare collections of such unsolved problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute and mathematician David\nHilbert. The former are noted for their\nmillion-dollar prize for the first verified solution to any one of the seven\nproblems, six of which remain unsolved at the time of writing.\nWhy should the average person care\nabout finding solutions to them? First,\nwe must realise their real world appli-cations. While some high profile fields\nare largely saturated in terms of research progress, Computer Science has\ntaken an opposite path and the field is\nincreasingly gaining momentum, with\ndiscoveries emerging due to breakthroughs in logic and theoretical computational systems and mathematics.\nA core component in electronic circuits is the transistor. The number of\ntransistors within computer processor chips have increased over time\nroughly according to Moore\u2019s Law,\nallowing for greater processing power.\nThis law states the number of transistors will double every 18 months and\neventually reach a limit. This limit is\nfrequently extended, and consumers\ncontinue to see improvements yearly.\nThis greater processing power is not\nlimited to consumer use, however, and\nresearch institutes have begun to take\nphysical realm, though such perfect\nelements are digitally representable.\nThis expressive property has opened\nthe door to new methods of analysis\nwith machines, using them as an aid\nto solving existing research problems.\nFor instance, a quantum mechanical\nsystem described to us by Physics is\nbest explored by a quantum computer,\na machine which is capable of operating on the same physical levels as the\nvery realm researchers are attempting\nto understand.\nThe Riemann Hypothesis, considered one of the most important problems in pure mathematics (Borwein\net al. 2008), involves the distribution\nof the prime numbers. The hypothesis states that the solutions to the\nRiemann-Zeta function lie on a critical\nline. While no proof yet exists, the first\nten trillion values have been verified\nby distributed supercomputing efforts.\nWhile an underlying pattern appears\nplausible, this Hilbert Problem remains\nunproven. The unpredictable nature\nof the prime numbers has been put to\nuse in the RSA (Rivest, Shamir and\nAdleman, MIT, 1978) cryptographic\nalgorithm. This system, considered\ncurrently unbreakable due to technical infeasibility, provides digital security with primes. Banks, websites and\ngovernments worldwide have adopted\nRSA and it is a common means of distributing an encryption key. A brute\nforce search would need to test possible primes to break this, but since there\nis no reliable way of determining the\nnext prime, computers may take years\nto perform this operation, rendering\nthis method impractical. A proof of the\nRiemann Hypothesis, however, may\nprovide a means of determining a pattern and breaking RSA.\nBrute force guessing of standard\npasswords is also impractical. We are\nall currently encouraged to create case-sensitive alphanumeric passwords. The\nproblem with checking every possibility lies not with verification; a computer\ncan easily identify whether two pieces\nof text are equal. It lies with first obtaining the solution to compare. Some\ntechniques search through dictionary\nentries, allowing quicker identification\nof common passwords.\nAnother Millennium Prize Problem,\ntouted the most important unsolved\nproblem in Computer Science, P vs NP\n(Cook, 1971) revolves around this con-cept. It asks the question of whether a\nproblem having quick machine verifiable solutions means those solutions\ncan also be found quickly. Problems of\nthe latter are classified P, while those\nthat are hard to compute are NP. In the\ncase of guessing passwords, it becomes\napparent that verification is a P problem (easy) while searching for the correct password is NP (hard).\nThe world currently assumes P not to\nbe equal to NP, as well as most Computer Scientists (Gasarch, 2002) agree-ing, while majority of security systems\nrely on this assumption. A claimed\nproof of P=NP (Deolalikar, 2010) was\nlater shown to be incorrect, though\nthe possibility raised many concerns\nfor security. The implications would\nbe far-reaching for society. A correct proof either way will have great\nimpact, since the solution to P vs NP\nintrinsically links to solutions of the\nother Problems. If P=NP, not only will\na new era of cryptography need to be\nabruptly ushered in, but NP-hard problems within countless other fields such\nas Biology (genome sequencing, protein structure prediction) and Physics\n(simulations) would become easier.\nThe effects of solutions on society\u2019s\nwidely used systems cannot be ig-nored. They would pave the way to a\nonce-distant future, with consequences\nsuch as the rise of new, future-proof\ntechnologies resistant to P=NP attacks,\nleading to better consumer systems.\nA hail of advancements in knowledge\nwould be made, with improvements\nto society\u2019s quality of life due to significant improvements to Biology,\nMedicine and other fields. Perelman,\nresponsible for solving the Poincar\u00e9\nConjecture (involving the characteristics of spheres in higher dimensions)\nremarked: \u201cWhere technology creates\nnew machines and devices, Mathematics creates their analogues \u2013 logical\nmethods for analysis in any field of\nscience.
