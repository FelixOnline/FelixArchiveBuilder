We will be discussing\nnext year's plans, and if you have\nany ideas, we will be only too glad\nto hear them (after all, the new\nbooking system was the brainchild of Kit Nair, who is not a committee member, and it is the\nbest thing to happen in the\nsnooker club for a long time!)\nIn the evening, there will be the\nfirst snooker club bar-night! Meet\nin Union Bar at 7pm. So make a point to come along\nto at least one of the above events.\nThe new committee (cordially\nknown as pitch black and the\nseven tw at s) are:\nPresident: Me. the tinted one as\nMaghar puts it,\nVice-President: Martin (leaning-tower of Pisa) Proudiove (who\nloves ya, Tracy)\nHon Sec : Steve (You've got\nstrong hands, haven't you Alex)\nJeans, who has astounded us all\nby swearing the most since he was\nelected,\nTreasurer: Dave (Nuts) Nuttall.\nEveryone's a fruit and n uttal case.\nPublicity Officer: Gareth Machin,\nbut we all call him machine.\nOrdinary Committee Members :\nGeoff Keymer, our hero, Chris\nCalvert, who keeps us all sane &\nlevel-headed by his calmness\n(even if he does have a funny\naccent), Alice Cameron: Alice is\ntall, blond, blue-eyed Quote: Why\ndont you come up and see me\nsometime?\"\nSo these are the loonies who are\nrunning the club. We're all very\napproachable (don't take that in\nthe wrong sense), and we are here\nto serve you.\nSanjit Teelock\n(President for life)\nWhich might not be very long\nafter this article.\nGaysoc\nWith the considerable oppression of gays in society and the\nlaw and the continuous misrepresentation of gays in the media and education it is likely that many people who are really gay\nwill never realise themselves or only after they have other\ncommitments, eg marriage, children, etc, leading to\nconsiderable conflict and misery.\nPlease think about the following points\n(1) Although it is likely that a sexual preference is established early in\nlife, there is no evidence that this preference can be permanently\nchanged by heterosexual or homosexual experiences, eg why are there\nso many married gays who only realised their true nature after\nmarrying. Do not lie afraid of suddenly being fixed as gay - it's just a myth to try to frighten bisexual and gay people into conforming by\nsuppressing their true nature.\n(2) The Christian Churches are by no means convinced of their\nattitude towards gay people; Catholic, Methodist and C. of E. Churches are all holding considerable investigations to try to\nunderstand the situation of gays in their respective churches. Indeed\nover 40 clergymen have signed a petition specifically repudiating the\nmasquerade of anti-homosexual prejudice as Christian morality.\n(3) The stereotypes of gays spread by the media are completely false;\ngays have the same spread of personality and jobs as heterosexuals, and\nit is certain that you have met many gay men and women without even\nrealising it.\n(4) Involving yourself by coming along to a gay organisation, eg.\nUL U discussion groups, requires no commitment whatever, you come\nalong just as an observer. You can involve yourself as much or as little as\nyou like - it is entirely up to you.\nPG Tips Next year's Postgraduate Affairs Officer is Richard Earl, a Physics\npostgraduate- His nomination was unopposed and his election was\nratified at the Postgraduate Group Annual General Meeting on\nThursday last week. He takes over the job on 1st July and can be\ncontacted hi room 732, Blacken Laboratory, internal telephone 4454.\nOther Committee members el ded are Treasurer Peter Mitchell,\nPhysics room 814, tel. 3867; Social Secretary Steve Gunn, Chemistry\nroom 535, lei 4116; and PG Welfare Officer John Whitehouse,\nChemistry room 833, tel. 4162. The post of Secretary remains unfilled.\nSOCIAL EVENTS\nA bar night held in Stan's real ale bar last Thursday evening was very\nsuccessful with a large attendance.\nThe new Committee will be organising a trip to Cambridge probably\non Thursday 19th July. The local beer festival starts on 19th July- what a coincidence! Last year's trip was definitely not to be missed and proved\na welcome relief from the worries of thesis writing. Further details will be\navailable soon from the new Committee.\nFEE SUPPORT SCHEME\nThe Ministry of Overseas Development is offering up to 600 awards to\nassist on grounds of hardship selected postgraduates from developing\ncountries who will be engaged on full time studies at British\nuni ever si ties, polytechnics and colleges of further education at the\nbeginning of the academic year 1979-80. Awards will take the form of\nannual grants of fixed amounts of about half of the overseas\npostgraduate fee for up to three years starting in 1979.\nEligibility is confined to students already following advanced courses\nin Britain and who are not in receipt of other major awards. They must\nbe following a course which the Ministry considers of developmental\nvalue and they must return to their own countries at the end of their\ncourse.\nApplication forms and further details are available from Mrs J.K. Morten in the Scholarships Office, Room 319, Sherfield Building,\ninternal telephone 2745.\nThe closing date for receipt of applications by the British Council is\n30th June 1979. Registry asks that forms should be returned as soon as\npossible and preferably not later than 15th June.\nSonia Hochfelder\nPG Affairs Officer 1978-79\nf JiH t afc SBDBI\nap mr jar^ W nH He BD Cfc OMf JWU ME?

There were two\ncandidates for the post, Mr Chakravarty (Mech Eng) and Mr Satinder Purewal (Chem Eng).\nThe election was preceded by the\ncandidates making the usual\nsincere blah-blah. Mr Chakra var ty pointed to his wide\nexperience in this sort of thing\nwhile Mr Satinder Purewal did a lot of hand waving and said\nnothing in particular. Election\nwas by a show of hands and Mr Gujral (Chem), the outgoing\nsecretary, did the counting.

However Chris Fox\nsaid that the motion passed would\nalmost certainly result in the\ndropping of the stripper and the\nreport highlighted this.\nSecondly, Mr Archer said he\nwould like the chance to explain\nwhy the name of Smoking\nConcert will be changed to the\n'Head lights Revue'. Unfortunately readers must remain unenlightened as he only proceeds to explain why it will no\nlonger be called Smoking Concert.\nThirdly, it was Chris Fox who\nreferred to undemocratic minorities in answer to a question\nas to whether the change had\ncome about because of protests by\nwomen. I do not see how Mr Archer can say that Mr Fox\nmeant something different to\nwhat he said, and it is surely clear\nfrom Mr Fox's answer as reported\nthat he was referring to the\nwomen making the protests and\nnot to any others. To my\nknowledge nobody other than\nRich Archer has considered that\nMr Fox might have meant all\nwomen.\nAs for his statement about 'those\npeople who go to Smoking Concert to\ndisrupt and drink the free beer' it\nwould be interesting to know to\nwhom he is referring. Those who\nprotested outside the Concert\nfirstly did not get any free beer,\nand secondly were not disruptive,\ntheir protest consisting of holding\nplacards, handing out leaflets and\npeacefully trying to persuade\npeople not to go in.\nThose who got free beer had to\nhave been legitimately inside the\nConcert, in other words they had\nbought a ticket or were performers. They were therefore\nas entitled to the free beer as\nanyone else.\nI personally was not aware of\nany disruptive action by\nprotesters either inside or outside\nthe Concert. They only disruption which occurred came\nfrom some members of the\naudience who were not prepared\neven to start listening lo the\nExecutive sketch.\nYours sincerely,\nSonia Hochfelder\nSMALL A DSI FOR SALE\nS Reg Ford Granada 2.0L Royal\nBlue coach work, Blue cloth\nupholstery, push button radio,\nhead rests, fog lamps, and sports\nwheels.\nExcellent value at \u00a32695\nTelephone 01-272 2880.\nFOR SALE\nUnconnected 'Armitage' Urinal, in\nexchange for 10 pints draught\nbass o.n.o.

The main business on\nthe agenda was to choose the\ncharities to benefit from RAG\nactivities next year.\nAfter much debate on the merits\nof various charities, a vote was\ntaken with the result that most of\nthe money raised next year will be\nused to buy a kidney machine (or\nmachines), and the minor charities to benefit will be\nGingerbread and Alcoholics anonymous.\nFollowing this, there was a discussion about new types of\ns lopp shirts to be sold next year.\nThe meeting then passed on to the\nappointment of the new RAG Treasurer and Rag Secretary.\nThese two posts were filled by\nRuth Langford, Maths 1, and\nKirsten Pratt, Maths 1 respect-iv ely. After this, outgoing RAG Chairman Graham Cox handed\nover to Raechel Snee, RAG Chairman elect, and the meeting\nended with the customary barrel\nof beer.\nMARANATHA\nSeek and you will find.\nThis, then, is the spirit in which our search must be conducted. We must cast aside apathy, pride, prejudice and sin, and seek God in scorn\nofthe consequences. Of all the hindrances to effective search the hardest\nto overcome are intellectual prejudice and moral self-will. Both arc-expressions of fear, and fear is the greatest enemy of the truth. Fear\nparalyses our search. We know that to find God and to accept\nJesus Christ would be a very inconvenient experience. It would\ninvolve the rethinking of our whole outlook on life and the readjustment\nof our whole manner of life. And it is a combination of intellectual and\nmoral cowardice which makes us hesitate. We don't find because we do\nnot seek. We do not seek because we do not want to find, and we know\nthat the way to be certain of not finding is not to seek.\nSo be open to the possibility that you may be wrong. Christ may in\nfact he true. And if you want to be a humble, honest, obedient seeker\nafter God, come to the book which claims to be his revelation. Come\nparticularly to the Gospels which tell the story of Jesus Christ. Give him\na chance to confront you with himself and to authenticate himself to\nyou. Come with the full consent of your mind and will, ready to believe\nand obey if God brings conviction to you. Why not read through the\nGospel of Mark, or John? You could read either through at a sitting\n(preferably in a modern translation), to let it make its total impact on\nyou. Then you could re-read it slowly, a chapter a day. Before you read,\npray-perhaps something like this:\n'God, if you exist (and I don't know if you do), and if you can hear this prayer (and\nI don't know if you can), I want to tell you that I am an honest seeker after the truth.\nShow me if Jesus is your Son and the Saviour of the world. And if you bring\nconviction to my mind, I will trust him as my Saviour and follow him as my Lord.'\nNo-one can pray such a prayer and be disappointed. God is no man's debtor. He honours all earnest search. He rewards all honest seekers.\nChrist's promise is plain: 'Seek and you will find.'\nFrom' Basic Christianity',\nJohn RW Stott. IVP.\nElk's Last Stand\nIf you want to park in\nCollege over July and you\nhaven't filled in an application for a temporary parking\npermit for July yet, then you'd better shift your 'arr is and\nget over to the Union Office\npronto and fill one in, as the\nclosing date is today (5.30pm). Right that's the serious bit\nover.\nAs the end of term approaches\nand the Elkin dynasty reaches its\nconclusion I get less and less to\nwrite about. My life seems to be\nsublimating into a sexual fantasy\nwhere fact and fiction cannot be\ntold apart, and a misplaced step\nand a weak link in the fragile\nfa brie of the spacetime continuum can combine to create\na world unknown outside of\npersonal dream and nightmare;\nwhere fragmented shapes exist in\na chaos of maximum entropy (he's talking about the union office\nagain) like a huge wet dream of a nineteenth century physicist.\nEnough of this, I'm beginning to\n.;o und like Justin Newiand.\nAnyway, what I'm really trying to\nsay is that there are only a limited\nno. of events left at IC this year\n(I 've certainly been saying it in a funny way). The major one of\nwhich is the Exec Party which is\ntaking place on the last Thursday\nof term (21st June) and which is\nbound to be as to rmer. Everyone\nleft at college is invited, bring a bottle, so put it down in your\ndiary (along with the optional\nWednesday 1 o 'clock one), it's usually an excellent party. The\nother one, of course, is Joint\nCouncil.

    "content": "A Summer Episode\nPART III - The Moral Dilemma\n' Let him in Peter,' Sue whispered, excited by the prospect of the imminent confrontation between the two men in her life. Obsequiously, Peter obeyed. To his surprise and relief, a young hotel porter stood at the door.' Iha f message for Mrs K,' he announced sole m ly, assuming the gallant posture of a Hermes.' There'sa long distance telephone call in fifteen minutes,' Sue exclaimed, mechanically checking the time on her watch. Peter dispatched the porter without a tip and closed the door.' Who can it be from?' Susan handed the note to her husband.' Your mother,' Peter conjectured.' Pe ute tre. Or my sister Louise. At any rate, Ido hope nothing cal amato ushas happened at home.' As she prepared herself, Peter felt a cold fury w hell ing up inside him. Over the past month, a cacophony of anguish had simmered within him... the doctor's error... the episode with Lucy... Sue's hysterectomy... and now Virgil' s mysterious appearance.' What is it dear? Move out of the way, Virgil will be here soon.'\n' Virgil... yes Virgil... Susan, just how did he manage to be in the same Aegean Island as us?' Peter bit his lip in exasperation. 'It's providence, dear, Now please ... will you help me down the stairs.'\n' Providence... there's no such animal,' Peter snapped.' And don't be facetious with me, Susan. I detest the ingratiating way you play on your physical disabilities. But I know your little aches and pains; they are the whimsical products of a fevered mind. You are a consummate hyper ch on dr iac, my dear.' He raved, deliberately mimicking the way his sire had said ' my dear'.' Well, Iam grateful lor your saccharine encouragements. God! You accuse me!\nYou, the epitome of an emotional cripple. Impe tur b able, you look on at the world's sufferings. Or perhaps you are some ghastly descendant of Medusa... she was merely your prototype... if anyone gazes into your eyes, they see nothing but stone.' Sue had always had a volatile temper, and now her claws were bared. She paused for breath, allowing just enough time for the vehemence of her tirade to sink into her husband.' You have never had to make a decision whose outcome becomes the watershed in the course of your life: a choice so horrendous in its repercussions that, whichever way you turn, you cannot escape the baleful figure of guilt. You eschew the more gruesome aspects of life by your romantic flight into science.' This reference to his occupation suddenly reminded Peter of his stature and reputation in the world of physics. He wondered whether the journal had accepted his latest paper. Susan' s mind was\nelsewhere.\n' You abhor the 'present' and the ' now': instead, you prefer to define the world in terms of atoms, subspace s and molecules. These are the figments of your fevered\nimagination, for, according to my senses, none of these peculiar animals exist. Goon! Build your castles in the sky, nebulous, ideological edifices whose battlements protect\nyou from the threat of the real world.' A short pause. Peter waited for the climax. It\ncame.' And to think I left my children for you!' At\nthis Sue ran out of the room, momentarily\nforgetting the pain her stomach.\nHalfway down the stairs, she doubled up in\npain. It was funny, though. She had come to\nassociate it with her children. She saw it as a kind of punishment for abandoning them.\nAnd how querulous Peter had become!\nLately, she had been repelled by his very-touch ... it felt like an icy wind. If only Virgil would have her back. Earlier in the day,\nwhen they had met so providentially in the\nstreet, she and Virgil had discussed the\npossibility of a reconciliation, though only\nbriefly.\nAfter a while, someone passed her on the\nstairs, and helped her to her feet.\nAs she reached the foyer, she sat down by\nthe manager's office to await the 'phone call.\nAt that moment, Virgil came striding in\nthrough the door. Although he lacked a certain air ol sophistication, a certain\ngentlemanly grace, his s wave appearance\nand athletic physique made him glow with a masculine prowess Susan admired in men.\nThe first thing she wanted to now was where\nthe children were.\n'I left them in the hotel ... have you ever\nseen a Greek baby-sitter:1\nMind you, they\ncan't all be like her. She must weigh over\nseventeen stone, the folds of flesh around her\nbelly are like the waves of the Aegean on a stormy day.' Susan laughed: Virgil's bubbling humour and nonchalant manner\nwas like a cool, refreshing breeze on a hot\nsummers day. How different il was to Peter's crass intellectualism, and the assault of his\nbarbed innuendos. She pressed his hand in\nhers, and kissed him lightly on the lips.\nVirgil ordered some ou zo and water. The\nconversation flowed. They spoke of past\nregrets and future hopes. It wasn't long\nbefore Susan broached the subject which was\nuppermost in her mind.\nUpstairs, Peter was pacing the floor with\nthe impatience of a lion at feeding time. Life is\nso ironical, he thought to himself. If only\nSusan had told him that he was Augustine's father before she had announced her false\npregnancy to him, ... he would never have\nbeen motivated to act with such vindictiveness, and the whole rueful episode\nwith Lucy never have transpired. As soon as\nthey returned to London, he would begin\nlegal proceedings to gain the custody of his\ndaughter Augustine. Then he wondered if\nVirgil knew.\nWhat was he up to, anyway?\nAfter a prolonged discussion, Susan and\nVirgil had reached agreement. She had\nassured her ex-husband that she was willing\nto forsake Peter, and return to Virgil for the\nlove she now realised that she had never lost\nfor him. Secretly, they planned an absurd\nelopement. That same night, Virgil was\nleaving with Jade and Augustine for\nKusadasi, a resort on the Turkish coast. They\nwere to meet on the quay side at ten o 'clock.\nThen again, Peter mused, perhaps Susan\nwas lying to him. Then what? Yet deep in\nhimself, he felt a trust for her which bordered\non devotion. She would always stay with him,\nthrough the direst misfortunes, just as he had\nunselfishly given her his moral support\nduring and after the operation. He was\ngenuinely shocked and hurt by her vicious\noutburst. He sorely regretted losing his\ntemper in the first place. When he had time,\nhe would apologise to her. But look at the\ntime! The telephone call should have come\nan hour ago. Peter decided to go downstairs.\nBy the time Peter arrived, in the foyer,\nVirgil had departed. He had so much that he\nwished to discuss with his wife, that all he\ncould ask her was whether the children had\ncome yet. Without batting an eyelid, Susan\nreplied that she had telephoned Virgil and\nsuggested that he postponed his visit until\nanother day.\nJust then, the manager beckoned them\ninto his office. In fact, the caller was Peter's brother Alan. During the course of the\nconversation, Peter, in his usual reticent\nmanner, said very little. Absorbed with\nromantic thoughts, Susan didn't notice the\ncolour suddenly drain from Peter's face. He\nreplaced the phone, staring vacantly into\nnothingness.\n'What's the matter? Peter, tell me; you\nlook as if you've seen a ghost.'\n' He said it was a sudden stroke ...\nun for see able' Peter covered his face with his\nhands, trying de spar at ely not to weep. Susan\nput her arm round him and begged him to tell\nher what had happened.\n' My father is dead!'\n' Oh!No!'' My brother has booked us a return flight\n.from Athens leaving tomorrow. I'm sorry,\nSusan,' Peter continued, wiping away a lone\ntear.\n'So amI, Peter. So amI.' by\nJustin Newland\n\n"

The latter is\nnow a dirty word, I cringe at the mention of it.\nBelow are two good reasons. The Humanoid(A, George B Lewis).\nDon't let the names fool you. This is a prime\nexample of those cheap Italian sci-fi rip-offs,\nwith credits which read like the A. A. guide to\nthe Mafia. I can't remember when I was last so\ndisgusted with a film for lack of story, poor\neffects and feeble acting.\nThe stars (joke) are Richard 'Jaws' Kiel and\nBarbara Bach, both of 'The Spy who Loved\nMe' fame, in this film it's a case of 001-wish-they-hadn't bothered ! The weak story\nconcerns the efforts of a Darth Vader lookalike and his PVC sidekicks to overthrow his\nbrother, the ruler of Earth. He is aided by a mad scientist who changes a mild-mannered\nspace pil cf into an in destruct able monster.\nThere are also laser arrows, a robot dog, a beautiful female in trouble ... Need I go on?\nThe wild use of lasers and corn flake packet\nspace ships clinch it. This is my first\nnomination for a new film award category -Films to be totally ignored'.\nThe Shape of Things To Come (A George\nMcGowan)\nThis can only be my second nomination for\nthe above category. Forget it. This is for film\nperverts only. Oh yes, and Mike Elkin.\nSeriously, this film masquerades as a remake of the 1936 classic. It is more of a sequel, being set 50 years after the first\nended. Definitely better than the pathetic\n'Humanoid' but still for science fiction\nvultures only.\nWell, the exams are drawing to a close and\nyou may have the odd spare evening. For this\nreason I thought I'd do a 'Film in Brief\ncolumn. OK so it is a 'Punch' rip-off!\nAnimal House - great fun, very amusing.\nBattlestar Galactica - disappointing\nThe Boys from Brazil - cloning plus a good\nWhich film is this a clip from?\nstory and cast.\nCalifornia Suite - stylish, inoffensive humour.\nThe Dear Hunter - shouldn't be missed.\nFantasia - made in 1940 but a masterpiece of\nanimation. Kentucky Fried Movie-hilarious if\nyou are not too fussy. Invasion of the\nBodysnatchers - sci-fi fans only. Midnight\nExpress - probably the best film in London.\nNosferatu - typically European but a different\ntype of vampire story. Superman - fun for\nkiddies of all ages. Towering Inferno - the\nbest disaster movie. Warriors - well worth it.\nWatership Down disappointing interpretation of the novel.\n12.-From which film were these two scenes cut (ie not shown) ?\nFilm Quiz\nAnd Now ...\nfaster than a speeding bullet, shorter\nthan War and Peace, it is a silly film quiz!!\nWho's been paying attention?\n1. Who wrote 'California Suite'? Name at\nleast one of his other screen comedies.\n2. Who starred in 'Invasion of the\nBodysnatchers', 'The First Great Train\nRobbery' and 'Animal House'?\n3.

NOT SATISFIED\nThe Rector is not satisfied with\nRefectory Committee's recent\nrecommendation for a0.25 per\ncent monthly wages regulator and\nhas asked the Union President to\ncollect inaccuracies in her paper\nwhich led to the decision.\nThe Rector would like a0.5 per\ncent monthly rise to compensate\nfor wage cost increases with a5 per cent adjustment in July. But\nMary Attenborough says that\neven alter amendments to her\noriginal calculations only 0.26 per\ncent is needed with a2.5 percent\nrise in July. She has accepted the 5\nper cent proposal for July.\nThe annual wages settlement is\npaid from l st December. The disagreement between the Rector\nand the Union President arises\nover how the increased wage costs\nshould be spread over the whole\nyear.\nMs Attenborough says that the\nRector's calculations are based on\nthe wage rise taking place on l st August which she considers is\nabsurd. Discussions are to\ncontinue at the next Refectory\nCommittee meeting before the\nend of this term.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS A BENEFIT The College's Overseas Students Committee is considering ways in which\noverseas students benefit Britain\nand investigating a way of quantifying this in cash terms.\nCollege is hoping to use this\ninformation to counter arguments\nabout allowing overseas students\nto study in Britain. The Government sets the fees for these\nstudents basing them on the\nrunning costs of the university\ndivided by the number of students. The Overseas Students\nCommittee says that this\ncalculation is unrealistic.\nAt its last meeting the OS C agreed to consider holding a conference about small scale\nenergy sources in the Third World at Imperial College. The conference would be a sequel to\none held at Reading in January.\nThe Committee also discussed\nEnglish language tests for overseas students. At the moment\nthere is no clear definition of the\nstandard of English required and\nsome students are finding that\ntheir knowledge of English is\ninadequate.\nThe Committee decided to set\nup a test which will be known as\nTOEFL teaching of English as a foreign language. All overseas\nstudents will have to take this test\nand reach a set standard. If they\nfail they will be able to retake it\nthe following year.\nWUS SCHOLARSHIP TOGO AHEAD The College and Union have\nagreed a means of going ahead\nwith a World University Service\nscholarship to enable a Third World student to study at the\nCollege.\nCollege is to find the money\ninitially but the Union is to\nlaunch an appeal next term to pay\nthe money back to College.\nThe Union will have to raise\nj \u00a32000 which they hope to raise\nfrom students during registration\nand from academic staff by\ndonations or covenants. The Union raised \u00a3500 for WU S last\nOctober by asking students to\ngive 50p each.\nWU S already runs schemes for\noverseas students at other British\nuniversities and will add the\nImperial College scholarship to\ntheir list of places advertised in Third World countries. The Rector and Union will have the\nfinal say in selecting the student to\nbenefit.\nThe appeal, which will be\nsigned by the Rector and the new\nUnion President, Chris Fox, is to\nbe advertised in the IC Union Handbook.\nNEW NURSES College is to allow two male\nnurses to live in the flat above the\nHealth Centre. In return for free\naccommodation they will be\nrequired to be available to look\nafter sick patients in the sick bay\nat night.\nThey will replace the three\nagency nurses hired by the Health\nCentre, making an annual saving\nof \u00a39000. The nurses will come\nfrom the Brompton Hospital.\nThe change will mean that\nstudents in the halls of residence\nwill no longer be able to call a College nurse if they are sick at\nnight but will have to call a doctor.\nMESS MUST GO It is rumoured that Roger\n'Tidy' Stotesbury, ICU Secretary\nelect, is to be seconded to the\nRoyal College of Science Union to tidy up their Union Office.\nThis course of action has been\nsuggested by Union President\nMary Attenborough following\ncomplaints from College about\nthe mess which can be seen from\nthe road. The office is close to the\nCollege's Summer Accomodation\nCentre office and College fear\nthat the summer visitors will get a poor impression of IC.\nOne of the promises Roger\nStotesbury made during his\nelection campaign was to keep the\nUnion office tidy so it looks like he\nwill have an early opportunity to\nprove his worth.\nMUSIC MARKET\nINCORPORATING \"SHADY DEALS\"\n20 HIGH STREET, PUTNEY, LONDON, SW15 DOWNSTAIRS\nNEW RELEASE & CHART SINGLES ONLY 70p LARGE SELECTION OF IMPORT LP's,7\"&12\" SINGLES\n1000s OF GOLDEN OLDIE SINGLES INC.

A nineteen year old, having committed a series of robberies in\nBosham, West Sussex, my home\nvillage, was being questioned on\nhis latest attempt. The evidence ol\nthe prosecutor had already been\ngiven, describing the arrest oi the\nculprit. A man and wife had been\nasleep upstairs when the wile was\nawoken by strange noises below.\nShe then heard someone coming\nup the stairs, and being somewhat\nforceful and unflappable she sat\nup in bed and called out \"who's| HHHH\nthere?\". When the accused was\nasked to give his evidence he\nadmitted his guilt. At this point\nthe judge asked his reaction on\nhearing someone shout out from\nthe bedroom.\n\"I couldn't believe it. I jumped\nout of my skin. On hearing the\nwoman shout at her husband to\nchase me I dropped everything\nand ran like a rabbit down the\nstairs and out into the road.\" He was fined a considerable sum of\nmoney.\nAs social secretary I would like\nto break up the apathy at IF and\nincrease the number of active\nmembers of the college. Being\nSocial Secretary oilers a particularly good chance to do\nthis.\nI, myself, being conveniently\nsituated in South Kensington, in a hostel where I am not quite under\nlock and key, enjoy a good social\nlife, and I would like to see a good\ndeal more social events organised\nat IF. I enjoy parties, going to the\ntheatre or concerts, classical or\nOtherwise, films, and particularly\nsailing and playing the piano.\nHoping to see some of you\ndown at 13a Cromwell Mews, lots\nof love, Anne xxx WaitingJpltuG Scheming\nThis is one of the disadvantages of\nbeing elected FELIX Editor before the\nend of session. You see that funny guy\nwith the permanent leer who seems to\ngrow out of the paste-up board on the\nright, was getting worried. It was only\nfive hours to copy deadline time and noone had submitted any more than a filled in What'sOn form and a creased\nexam paper.\nI was sitting over a meal of pie and hall\nbaked chips munching a paper cup when my\ndream world of account books and cleaning\nloam was destroyed by the words, ' How do\nyou fancy I looked up ... 'writing an\nEditorial this week? You can have a whole\npage if you like.'\nNormally I would have jumped at the\nchance; who wouldn't?( shut up and read!)\nToday was different. Today I had just walked\nout of'an extremely exhausting exam, yes you\nknow what I mean, and I just did not exist.\nThe strange thing is here Iam writing\nabout why I wasn't going to write what I'm writing.\nLots of people seem to be asking me lots of\nquestions. This doesn't often happen to me so\nI 've been a bit slow to realize just w hafs going\non. I gather that some of you understand I am\nproducing FELIX next year, and organising\nall your posters and party tickets etc. Of course you wish to know when my copy\ndeadlines are and il you can break them. I do\nnot yet know if it is going to be possible to\nmail a FELIX to prospective Freshers and\nwhether I can produce one if it is, but if I do\nthen I will only include copy in my possession\nby 5.30pm on Monday23 rd July.

If\nyou come in the week before term starts I can\noiler no guarantee that the work will be\ncompleted in time.\nJust before you all write me poison-pen\nletters. I had better make my peace.

She is on holiday but is taking time off to visit IC Union\nAbout twenty students from Chalmers University study at IC each\nyear and Lars' visit is aimed at fostering a good relationship between the\ntwo universities.\nLars and Mian are two of Chalmers' six sabbatical Union officers. The\nUniversity has a similar number of students as IC and is a centre for\nScience and Technology.\nLars arrived on Wednesday and is to stay a week. While over here he\nhopes to see Imperial College, meet students including the Swedish\nstudents here this year, and see London, though he is not interested in\nthe usual tourist attractions but wants to see London life.\nSwedish Sabbaticals\nVisit Imperial\nSwedes have the reputation of\nmaking the most of the opportunity to consume as much\nalcohol as possible when abroad\nas it is very expensive in Sweden.\nMary Attenborough and FELIX\nEditor John Harris gave them an\nearly opportunity to quench their\nthirst - on the tube journey to\nSouth Kensington from the\nairport. There then followed a sherry session in the Union Office\nand a hurried visit to the Queens\nbefore lunchtime closing for a pint\nof Lars' favourite, Guinness.\nIn an attempt to give them\nexperience of English cooking,\nMary invited them to a dinner\nparty at her new flat where she\nserved roast beef and Yorkshire\npudding cooked by herself.\nHowever, Mary admitted that she\nhad never cooked Yorkshire\npudding before and at the time of\nwriting it is not known whether the Swedish guests survived her\nattempt.\nLars is expected to have an\nopportunity to meet the Rector\nand the Union is hoping to\narrange a trip to Silwood. On\nMonday the visitors will meet\nUnion Officers over a wine and\ncheese party in the Union office.\nLars will also be able to get a true\npicture of life as an IC student as\nhe will be staying in a hall of\nresidence and will doubtless\nexperience several moon ies. Mian will be staying on another\nweek in the British Isles and hopes\nto visit Ireland. External Affairs\nOfficer John Passmore, who\ncomes from Northern Ireland, has\nbeen explaining to her how to\navoid the bombs.\nFELIX hopes they will enjoy\ntheir visit and hopes that relations\nbetween these two Universities\nwill continue to prosper.\nMian and Lars outside the FELIX Office yesterday\nNEWS IN BRIEF\nHEAD TENANCY OPENS? College is asking students what\nthey thought of the new accommodation in Lex ham Gardens with a view to taking on\nflats for up to 60 students from\nnext year.\nNineteen students have been\nhoused in the new Lex ham Gardens head tenancy scheme\nthis term. If they arc satisfied\nCollege will extend the scheme.\nBIG CATS EXPENSE College has estimated that it\nwill cost \u00a3750 to clean the two\nstone lions at the foot of the\nQueens Tower painted blue by\nstudents of Queen Mary College\nearlier this term.\nThe Vice President of QM C Union has promised to make a contribution to the cleaning and\nIC Union are to ask College to\ndeal directly with QM CU as IC Union consider that the problem\nis nothing to do with them.\nPUBLICATIONS CHAIRMAN ELECTED The new Publications Board\nChairman is to be Jon Firth of IC Radio.

Had he\nbeen a real tactician he would then have removed Mahers from the\nattack as 26 were taken from his second (final) over.\nUC eventually made 231 with the help of a non run out decision to\ngive them their last 15.\nIC's7 players included 5\nopening batsmen and My lv aga nam and A Guest were chosen\nto do the honours. These 2 gave\nIC a solid start until A Guest fell\nto a bad decision from umpire\nA.N. Otherguest.\nThis brought Davis to the\ncrease. The opposing captain\nthought that this pair were bad\nenough to get out to some slow\nnear donkey droppers. Davis and\nMy lv aga nam thought otherwise\nand proceeded to carve the\nbowling until a proper spinner\nwas brought into the attack to\nremove My lv aga nam. Davis continued to strike\nfiercely until torrential rain\nstopped him (on 47 n.o.) from his\n50 and prevented fourth opener\nFurnish (8n.o.) from his second\nadvent into double figures this\nseason.\nAt 91 for 2 off 17 overs and with\n19 overs remaining it was\ngenerally agreed that with these\ntwo fine batsmen at the crease it\nwas only rain that saved UC. To decide the drawn match\nUC challenged IC to a boat race\nin the bar afterwards which we\nwon in style, (you try boat-racing\nwith Abbot ale).\nTeam: Furnish, Mylvaganam,\nTurner, Davis, Mahers, A Guest, AN\nOtherguest.\nTENNIS CLUB\nOn Saturday, IC tennis were due to play a men's doubles against\nGower and a mixed against International Student House.\nOn Friday, O 'Boyle was in the bar unaware of what lay in store.\nMorning came and a dozen racquet-wielding hopefuls crowded in GCP\nand sped towards Harlington. Sean and Julia who had hogged the front\nseat payed dearly for it by sticking most uncomfortably (to the seats).\nAfter a5 minute delay, changing rooms were located and one of the\nteam waltzed out in tennis shorts a la RCS AGM, the latest thing so I'm told. The rest of the players dressed some what more sedately knocked\nup.\nIn due course the opposition arrived:\n'How d 'you do?'\n'Fine thanks mate, how do you?'\n'Nice weather for it.'\n'Probably piss down later'\nThe courts themselves were in fairly good shape, if a bit slow, it had\nbeen raining earlier on. Rich Jenner, last year's captain turned up late,\nthe team was complete. The match started.\n'These two don't look much good'.\n'Naa probably thrash 'em'.\n1st round finished.\n'Better than they looked weren't they?'\n'Not bad at all'.\n'Perhaps the others won'\n'No we got hammered, bet you beat their third pair though, didn't look\nmuch good'\nO 'Boyle and Jenner exchanged withering glances. And so it went. A break for tea. Perhaps they'll slow up a bit after tea, flash gits, mused IC\nto themselves over sticky chocolate biscuits and tomato s arnie s.3 rd round after tea: no change, but with true gri tIC did manage to win\nthe odd game or two.\nThe mixed didn't fair much better; they could hardly have done worse!\n: TENNIS IC 1st IX vs Westfield 1st XI\nIn the absence of Mel Kinkie this week, IC could only raise\nnine perverts.\nToplis, still wearing his well ies after a hard morning on the\nsheep farm, managed to lose the toss again. Westfield elected\nto bat which left IC to chase around in the tropical heat.\nToplis ignored Morton's advice to bow) his off-breaks and bowled bis\nnormal straight up and down rubbish. Somehow he managed to take 5\nfor 22 and this included a splendid catch behind the wicket by Morton. This surprised everybody as Morton had spent most ofthe afternoon\nlusting after women footballers in tight shorts, white socks and PY C shirts.\nEllacott claimed to have a head-ache. This had two effects -firstly he was unavailable to the\nrest of the team and secondly he\nonly managed to bowl one\nstraight ball all afternoon. The\nstraight ball so surprised the\nbatsman it claimed Ellacott's only\nwicket. My lv aga nam and Slator\ndowned their whips and turned\ntheir arms over. Both were\nsuccessful by their normal standards returning figures of 1-29 and 1-27 respectively. As. usual, IC used one joke bowler.\nToday was the turn of Acford who\nis due to appear in court next\nweek charged with exposing\nhimself in Hyde Park. Westfield,\nwith no perversions amongst the\nwhole team, finally declared after\ntea at 122 for 9.\nMorton and My lv aga nam opened for IC. The latter looked\nquite classy until playing on a wide ball after scoring 28. Morton showed an uncharacteristic lack\nof talent and scratched around for\na lucky 14. Furnish did not last\nlong as he was distracted by a passing school-girl. However he\ndid improve his batting average\nby scoring one run. Pickles\nremained at the wicket for al least\ntwo minutes and was given out for\nself abuse when he had scored 9.\nSlator looked like swinging the\ngame IC's way by scoring 0.\nToplis (still in his well ies) scored\nan agricultural 10. and Mahers\n(inspired the night before by his\ninflatable rubber woman) achieved a life-long ambition and\nactually scored some runs. He had\nreached the amazing total ol 3\nbefore a harsh umpiring decision\nsent him back to the pavilion.\nThis left Acford and Ellacott\n(complete with headache) to try\nand play out the last few overs.\nAcford's forward defensive lunge\nwas very prominent and he\nremained not out 1. It was\nEllacott who generously dol lied a catch to short extra-cover oil the\npenultimate ball of the day to\nlose us the match. IC finished\nwith the impressive total of 79 and\ntwo rape victims.\nAfter the match we could at\nleast enjoy dirty films and an orgy\nin the bar, even though we had\nbeen defeated by eleven straight\nmen.\nROCK THE WRIST, with acknowledgements to\nEC Cushion Productions Ltd.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCROQUET CLUB\nThe croquet season has\nbegun. That's why you may have\nseen idle people hitting multi coloured balls around the\nQueen's lawn to no apparent\npurpose. We are the IC Croquet\nClub. Actually Croquet is a game\nrequiring skill, finesse and thought and not a little deviousness.\nIf you think you might like to\nplay, why not come along to an\nintroductory session for beginners at 1pm on Wednesday\n13th June beneath the Queen's Tower, where our resident expert,\nProf Neal will demonstrate the\nbasics of the game.\nFor those of you who already\nplay, and would like to join the\nclub (you need to be a member of\nuse the equipment) the man to\ncontact is Julian Radowicz, Maths\nII. Come along on Wednesday,\nanyway, and meet us.\nAfter being accosted in bar afterwards and relentlessly teased all the\nway back, (we only won 2 games all afternoon) I was quite glad to get\ndown to some Fluid mechanics revision, which I probably failed\nanyway.\nThere's always next time.\nTeam: Barry Witts (Capt) Noori, Sean and Rich, Larry and Sydney.\nMixed: Julia and Richard, Sara and ?, Hazel and Rob.\n\n"

Insurance etc\nFollowing the correspondence recently concerning the\nchanges in the Insurance policy covering students' possessions,\none or two facts have come to light that may clarify the situation. Firstly, it appears that Residence Office were notified of the\nchange in the value of goods covered( to T/750). But they had not\nbeen informed of the10% limit on records, cassettes etc. At the\ntime of writing her letter Sue Kali c in ski was unaware that\nResidence Office knew of the change.

The advantage of the covenant is that it enables you to recover the basic rate\ntax that your parents have already paid on the gross amount that they\ncovenant to you. This means that, with ba is c rate tax at 33%,if they\ncovenant to pay you \u00a3100, they have already paid \u00a333 in tax on that\nmoney, so they pay you \u00a367 and you get the other \u00a333 from the taxman.\nTHE PROCEDURE\nThe Consumer Association have worked out a form of deed which the\ntaxman should accept that goes as follows:-/, John Smith, of 16 Moon Street, Blackburn, covenant to pay my son, William\nSmith, of the same address, a gross amount of \u00a3116.67 on each of the following\ndates in each year, namely 1 October, 1 January, 1 April, for the period of seven years, or for the period of our joint lives, or until he ceases to be receiving full time\neducation at any university, college, school or other educational establishment\n(whichever is the shortest period), the first payment to be made 1 October 1979,\nDated 1 September 1979 Signed, sealed and delivered by John Smith\nin the presence of\n(witness's signature and address)\nIt is advisable to follow this example exactly, substituting the\nappropriate names, addresses, amounts and dates of payment.\nThere are certain points which should be noted:-1) You can't benefit from a covenant unless you are aged 18 or over or\nare married.\n2) The instalments can be paid at whatever intervals you like but the\nfirst one must be paid after the date on which the covenant is executed\n(ie signed and sealed)\n3) The amount - this can be expressed either as 'a gross amount of \u00a3x' as in the example above, which means that your parents deduct the tax,\nwhich you will get back, from the gross amount and pay you the rest. If\nyou do it this way, they will have to alter the amount that they give you\nevery time the basic tax rate changes (which isn't very often). So if you\nare covenanted a gross amount of\u00a3100 and basic rate tax is at 33%, your\nparents would give you \u00a367 whereas if the basic rate went down to 30%\nthey would pay you \u00a370.\nThe other way of doing it is for you to be covenanted 'an amount\nwhich after deduction of tax at the basic rate amounts to\u00a3x' This means\nthat they pay you the same amount all the time but the refund from the\ntax man will vary with changes in the basic rate. This second variety is\napparently the most common.\n4) The formalities. You can copy out the covenant with the necessary\nalterations as set out above. It must be signed by whoever is\ncovenanting to pay you and witnessed by someone other than yourself.\nIt might be a good idea lor the witness not to be a member of your\nimmediate family. The deed must be sealed. This archaic bit of\npantomime can be carried out with sealing wax or by sticking on a little\ndisc of red paper (which you can make yourself). You have got to end up\nwith some sort of red bit stuck onto the bottom of your covenant. When the deed has been executed it should then be delivered ie handed over to\nyou.\nTHE SNAGS\nWhen the parental contribution is paid by way of a covenant, the\ngross amount covenanted is treated as taxable income. This means that\nif your income from the covenant and eg vacation work exceeds your\npersonal allowance (\u00a3985 for a single person at present) Then you will\nhave to start paying tax. Nevertheless if you don't earn a total too much over the personal allowance, you should find that you are paying tax at\na lower rate than that at which you are reclaiming it on the covenant.\nThe other possible stumbling block may be that the income from the\ncovenant can affect your parents1 child tax allowance. From April1979, however, the tax allowance has for the most part been abolished\nand replaced with increased child benefits. There are a few exceptions\nbut although I have rung a number of different tax offices, I have been\nunable to get a consistent account of what these are. It seems that unless\nyou have been at college since 1975, then unless you are under 19, your\nparents won't get a tax allowance for you anyway so you need n't worry\nabout this complication but it might be a good idea if your parents were\nto check with their own tax office before executing the deed.\nCLAIMING THE TAX BACK\nOnce the first payment has been paid under the covenant, you can\nget a form called an R185( AP) from your tax office. Your parents have\nto fill this in with details of how much they have paid you and how\nmuch tax they have deducted. You then have to take this with your\ncovenant to your tax office (the nearest one will do if you haven't already got one). Once they have had a look at it they may send you a form to fill in and then you get your money.\nAny further information can be sought in the Welfare Centre on the\nthird floor of the Union Building.\nACCOMMODATION FOR NEXT YEAR\nThe Welfare Centre has some details of landlords who you can\ncontact to book rooms, flats etc for next year.

Much of this is\nconnected with the structure of the college and going about the daily business of representing all you students.\nCollege committees and how\nthey relate to the Union\nOn lots of committees there are student\nmembers, either ex-officio (i.e. because of their\noffice), or elected by ICU Council. Council representatives are elected at Joint Council( when both years' Council get together) in June of the\nyear before the session in question.\nIf for any reason an elected representative\ncannot attend one of the meetings, we try and send\nsomebody in their place.\nIf you are interested in the workings of any of these committees then pop into the Union Office\nand find out who is on them, and you can chat with\nthem some time. The President and Honorary Secretary tend, between them, to be on most\ncommittees. The Rector and the Governing Body are responsible for all decisions in the last instance. The Rector consults his advisory committees,( Rector's committees), but on many decisions will hold individual discussions about an issue with relevant people, e.g. College Officers, President ICU. In particular, refectory prices and hall rents, etc., he\nwill discuss with the President, ICU. The Deans committee meets about every two weeks and discusses many financial and other matters. It does not officially exist, but consists of Deans, the Senior Tutor, the College Secretary,\nand the Rector,( and maybe others I don't know of).\nThe amazing diagram attached to this ' Mutters' explains the various committees. The lefthand side are Rector's committees which are advisory. The right hand side are the committees of the\nGoverning Body. These report directly to\nGoverning Body. Governing Body meets three times per year, and Finance and Executive Committees also about three times a year. The most important thing about these meetings is that they have three student\nobservers and we get a really good lunch in170 Queens Gate. These meetings always magically end just at the right time for lunch, but retain a modicum of democracy as there are often\ndiscussions on an issue. Governing Body consists of the Chairman,( presently Sir Henry Fisher from Oxford), the Deans, the College Secretary( who is\nclerk to the Governors), a representative of the\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, five Commonwealth Government representatives, seven representatives of professional institutions, four members of IC teaching staff, five people from the City and Guilds of London Institute, five from UL, four from the.\nDepartment of Education and Science and six\nappointed by the crown. Union Committees\nWe try to make some use of our representatives\non College committees by actually discussing issues\nat various Union committees, or if the issue is a major one, taking it to Councilor a Union General Meeting,( e.g. Scholarships were discussed at aUG M). Union committees are either major subcommittees of Council which mostly coordinate the clubs and societies and administer finance,\n(except Overseas Students committee, which also\ncampaigns and represents overseas students), or there are committees for a certain area of work such as academic affairs. Postgraduate Affairs committee is both a social and representative body. I have roughly labelled all the College committees we have representatives on with the\nUnion committee they would relate to.\nKEY Labels represent ICU committees according to the\nfollowing key:( a) Academic affairs committee( department\nrepresentatives and others)\n(a.c.c.) Athletic clubs committee( a major sub-committee for athletic clubs)\n(c.a.) City and Guilds Union academic affairs\ncommittee( e) Executive committee( President. Hon. Secretary, Deputy President plus three C CU President s)!(o) Overseas students committee( p.g.) Postgraduate affairs committee(s) Sil wood Park committee( all students based at\nSil wood)( w) Welfare committee( which also has an accommodation discussion group)( w.a.)I CW A, Imperial College Womens Association Mary Attenborough\nPresident, ICU\n\n"
