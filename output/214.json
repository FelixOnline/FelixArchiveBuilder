    "content": "10 FELIX Fives Hockey Cup Final\nAT LAST\nBy I. Collins\nOn the \\\\th of Feb. at the\nHampstead courts, I.C. played\nUniversity College School Old\nBoys. The Old Boys have had\na good season, and have beaten\nseveral sides who in turn have\nbeaten I.C., and perhaps it was\nthe knowledge of this that produced a more even, balanced\ngame from both the I.C. strings\nthan they have previously pro-duce d. The pattern of the first game of\nthe first set was maintained all\nevening; first one side would\ngain the service advantage, a few\npoints, and then lose a few hands\nand allow the other Jeam to go\nahead. After this first game had\ngone to 12-11 for I.C., we had\nanticipated a long struggle, but\ngradually the Old Boys were worn\ninto making mistakes. The following games reflected this as-ce nden cy, for I.C. drew ahead on\nDoints. the final results being a long awaited win for I.C., by 90\npoints to 49 and 8 games to nil.\nNeither of the strings were\nin attacking mood,.and tended to\nbe content with a tight, consistent\ndefence which inevitably drives\nopponents to take risks in attack.\nWhile this was a successful approach on this occasion, both\nstrings need to pay more thought\nto the placing of attacking shots.\nThus, 3 months after their first\nmatches, I.C. are now playing\nclose to their best potential, and\nit is very satisfy to see two such\ngood results as this one and the\nmatch of a fortnight ago against\nU.C. Volley Ball\nMoral Victory\nfor I.C. By M.H. Ahari\nEC's newly founded Volleyball Club took on Southgate T.& the champions of S.E. England, in\ntheir first match.\nAlthough I.C. lost, the result\nwas a moral-victory. It took I.C.a long time to settle and stop\nlosing points from services hitting\nthe low ceiling, and before this\ncould be achieved the first game\nwas lost.\nIt was apparent that I.C. need\nexperience and more team work.\nThe final result was 2-1 against\nI.C. with scores 7-15^15-11,11-15.\nThere will be another match on\nThursday, 25th Feb. against\nLycee! Francais. I.C. are now\narranging more fixtures with other\nclubs with a return match against\nSouthgate in the summer.\nTeam: M. Ghanai (capt.), M.H. Ahari, C.N. Khoo, F.T. Nadir, F. Saitaabi, I. Nedjat, C.W. Chia.\nCUP DAY\nBy E. Needham\nThe first week in March is the\nweek the Hockey Club have been\nbuilding up to for the whole of the\nseason.\nOn Wednesday, March 3rd the\nCup Final takes place against\nWest Ham; every member of the\nteam is geared to this match, and\nis looking forward to the possibility of celebrating a victory for\nthe first time in four years, at the\nHockey Club dinner next day.\nThe path to the final had only\none great hurdle\u2014the quarterfinal match against C.E.M. which\nLC won 2-1. As always a terrific spirit fired the match with\nreally top class hockey. I.C. won\nbecause, although the Cemian\nforwards had some brilliant individuals, the I.C. forwards linked\nup well, and were consequently\nmuch more effective.\nI.C.'s chances are good. The\ndefence has been firm most of this\nseason, centre-half Ray Phillips\nshould prove a solid answer to\nWest Ham's star-studded forward\nFencing\nline ana the rest of the half-back\nline will be strengthened by Blackheath player Anketell, who has a great natural ability and fitness.\nThe forward line remains the\nenigma. I.C. always seems to\nrely^on Hough and Stenning to\nscore individual goals. If,they\ncan do this in the final, the forward line could then begin to\nwork together, and make the\nvictory complete.\nIndeed, a victory on March 3rd would be a fitting goodbye for the\nPresident of the Hockey Club,\nMr. A. Stevenson, who is retiring\nfrom the post after rendering his\nservices since 1939.\nProbable Team:\nE. Needham.\nft. Heading.\nK. Peters.\nJ. Anketell.\nR. Phillips.\nE. Castell (capt.).\nG. Goddard.\nM. Stenning.\nE. Hough.\nN. McKenzie.\nM. Lee.\nFREE COACHES will leave\nthe Union at 1.15 p.m. on Wednesday, 3rd March, for the\nHockey Cup Final at Motspur\nPark. Supporters will be more\nthan welcome and should sign\nthe lists outside the Bar and in\nthe Main Entrance Hall. A good\nwin in the afternoon should lead\nto an excellent evening's enter-tain ment. Table Tennis\nCup Run Ended\nBy J. Greenwood\nThe successful run of the first\nteam in the Cup ended in the\nsemi-final against a strong team\nfrom Northern Poly. In a fine\nmatch I.C. went down 4-5. The j first team has now finished its\nleague programme and has. been\nbeaten only once and will probably finish second in the league\ntable. In the last few matches of\nthe season the second and third\nteams should just avoid relegation\nin their respective divisions.\nShooting\nConvincing Win Riding High By D. Scott\nThe first match this term was\nagainst Risinghill, which LC. lost\n6-3,but-the team had a convincing\nwin on Tuesday, Feb. 16th, against Chelsea, winning both\nsabre and foil, 6-3, 6-3. B.A. Lovett, D.J. Scott, and W.A. White fought in the Sandhurst\nopen electric foil competition on\nSat. 13th Feb., all three reaching\nthe quarter final. M.A. Whitedid well to reach the semi-final.\nBy J. Dimmock\nNow that the winter season of\ninter-college small-bore shooting\nhas nearly finished it can be seen\nthat I.C. rifle club has done very\nwell.\nThe Pistol team (I.P. Freeman, J. Coombs, D.H. Davies)\nhas been outstanding, winning all\nits nine matches to finish top of\nthe 1st division in the London\nUniversity Leagues. In their last\nmatch the team set up a new UniI N TO UC WE WANT MORE\nOn March 9th, the University'Grants Committee comes to I.C. It is a surprising fact but with academic buildings expanding at a_ great rate, the college has plans for little expansion of sports facilities in South Kensington. Apart from the Sports Centre there is\nnothing, yet a great deal is needed.\nThe \" MEMORANDUM FROM THE UNION \" contains a very\nsensible section on recreational facilities\u2014to quote \"Although the\nsports ground at Harlington is excellent and very much appreciated,\nit is of necessity too far away for casual activity. Some students do\nnot wish to play organised games, but if facilities are readily available will spend a couple of hours each week playing squash, tennis,\nswimming or gymnastic sports (basketball and volleyball, etc.).\"\nThe main requirement is obviously a gymnasium, large enough\nto accommodate badminton, basketball and volleyball courts.

    "content": "2 FELIX Race - S. African Style\nSouth Africa is trying to show the world that it has found a so lu tip n to the problem of race relations and that partition will work.\nBut the South Africa form of partition is not one in which both sides\nhave complete autonomy as in Ireland, India, and Germany, but\nrather where the \" black \" partition area is subservient to the \" white \"\ncentral government.\nThe Rt. Rev. Joost de Blank, formerly Anglican Archbishop of\nCapetown was speaking to an audience of 250 in General Studies on\nThursday, 11th February.\nA number of ways of overcoming racial problems have been\nimplemented with varied success. The founding fathers of America\nsaw fit to exterminate the indigenous ancestors, and deprive those\nwho survived of any rights. In Australia exclusion, in particular of\nyellow peoples, has been practised (their immigration laws are now\nsomewhat more lax). In recent years territorial partition has been\nadopted as a working compromise, but has never been regarded as\nan ideal permanent settlement.\nFor a century the United States\ntried to maintain a\" separate\nbut equal\" policy for whites and\nblacks. But they found that those\nalready privileged tended to gain\nextra privileges and those who\nwere under-privileged lost. -' Ten\nyears ago the Federal Court ruled\nthat \" all men were equal,\" but\nits implementation has been\nstormy.\n\"The South African government is prepared to accept the\nword ' separate' by not ' equal.'\nBlack South Africans in white\nareas of the country have virtually no rights and certainly no\nchance of expressing their grievances ; only in black areas may\nthey make themselves heard at\nmunicipal level.\nBishop de Blank sym pathis ed with the firmly entrenched white\nminority in that South Africa was\ntheir homeland and that they\nwere terrified of being submerged\nby the bia ck majority. To retain\ntheir ident iy they resort to threats\nof force, apartheid, and every\nmeans open to them.\nThe next point at issue will be\nthe decision of the International\nCourt of Justice oh the sovereignty of South-West Africa this\nautumn. The S. A. Government\nhas pledged that it will accept me\nCourt's decision if it goes against\nthem, but with the border retracted 800 miles the core will be\nstrengthened. Increased world\nopinion against S. A. policies will\nunite the British and Boers in a common resolve favouring apartheid. They would rather see the\nwhole system come down in\nflames around them like Hitler's bunker than change.\nHowever, he insisted that it\nwas very important to convince\nthe black South Africans that the\nrest of the white world does not\nnec esn ril y agree with the S. A. Government; such a means of\ncommunication is still open.\nRegarding his own exit from\nS. A., Bishop de Blank emphasised the courtesy shown him by\ncivil servants though his relations\nwith government ministers had\nnot always been as happy as they\nmight; he was glad to say that\nhe had never been threatened\nwith arrest.\nD.I. W. RAMSEY\n(from front page)\nDr. Ramsey went on to give a map of the Christian's view of\nman and another of the Humanist's view, and to consider the\nconditions under which the two\nviews did and did not overlap.\nWe are God's creatures; God\ncreated the world and formed\nman in His own image. Thus, he\nsaid, there: is not only a line of\ndistinction but also a likeness between man and his creator. The\nChristian acts always in creature ly humility, not towards any ag gra a>di semen t of himself, his neigh-b ours, race or nation, but in the\nmutual service of the world.\nMan's goal is to seek perfect fellowship with God, and while in\nthis world he must learn, understand and control the process of\nnature in a fitting manner.\nAs a creed Humanism has\nseen three classical epochs. In\nthe first, the Greek, the attitude\nwas summed up by Sophocles\u2014\n\" Many things are marvellous but\nnothing is more wonderful than\nman.\" In the Renaissance and\nthe |resent day Humanism has\nbeen revived and enhanced'by the\ndevelopment of science; today \"If\na man can emancipate himself\nfrom superstitions and increase\nknowledge of himself and the\nworld, then he will increase his\nown happiness and discover the\ngood life.\"\nink, No Wheels!\nMechanical devices always work whereas electrical ones . .\nThis was one of the many maxims cited toy Professor Laithwaite at\nhis inaugural lecture on Tuesday, 16th February.\nThe Lecture was accompanied by many demonstrations, \" which\nwill be done in ascending order of danger, so that if we fuse the lights\nyou will only miss the end of the lecture.\" If anyone ever considered\nPower Electrical Engineering to be a dead subject they would have\nbeen convinced otherwise by Professor Laithewaite.\nProfessor Laithwaite worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment during the war. He became an Undergraduate in 1946 at\nwas interviewed\nManchester (he\nby Sir Willis Jackson )and went\non to research in digital computers. Professor Laithwaite gave the\nimpression that Tie could make\nany subject interesting, but when\ntalking about his pet subject,\nlinear motors, he excelled himself.\nHe began by discussing the operation of an ordinary induction\nmotor, and then with the aid of a rubber model motor (which he\nunzipped to much laughter), he\nex-plaine d the transition to a linear motor. He later fired ah\niron stake from a tubular linear\nmotor into a chunk of wood. \" I don't give much for the chances\nof the people in the front row.\"\nHe enlarged on the development\nwork done on the linear motor\nwhile he was at Manchester. He\nshowed some slides of the first\none he had set up; it was equipped\nwith a seat \" Because if you can't enjoy work what is the point of\ndoing it.\" With a maximum\nspeed of 25 mph and an acceleration of \" ig\" with a200 lb person\non it, the machine was fast\nenough for an 80 ft. laboratory!\nWe were then shown a film of the\nmotor he developed in conjunction with British Rail, which\nclearly showed the fantastic acceleration that can be obtained\nusing linear motors.\nFinally he demonstrated the\nlevitation experiments he has also\nshown on T.V. By now the\ndemonstrations were taking very\nhigh currents. \" This coil takes\n90 amps\u2014we are only fuSed for\n60 amps.\" This was the best\ninaugural lecture I have ever attended and if the applause was\nanything to go by, many others\npeople must also have thought so.\nAJ.O. Non-Christian Humanism the\nArchbishop illustrated as a beautiful picture of all the wonderful\npropositions to attain happiness\nframed with a misleading inscription\u2014\"And this is all.\" the\nChristian Humanist rejects this\nframe, for this is NOT all.\n. While religion does tell many\ntruths it cannot tell all. Any\nscience that is sincerely seeking\nthe truth has been created by\nGod's will. Conversely, no single\nscience is omni competent to explain man, the world or the uni-verse. Psychiatry is of considerable help to people with certain\naberrations, but alone it cannot\nprovide a complete solution to\ntheir problems. The \" other\nworldly\" aspect of Christianity\nmay be used as a form of escap-ism; but this is false religion, just\nas there can be false use of\nscience.\nQuesioned of the modernity of\nmoral-thinking in the Church, Dr.\nRamsey stated that it must go\nthrough periods of evolution in\nline with scientific discoveries.\nThd question of birth control has\nto be integrated with marital laws.\nIn regard to Leo Abse's bill, he\nfelt sympathy with those who suffered hardships through se para tion, but was not prepared to\ncheapen marriage by making it\nnot a life-long contract but one\nthat may be broken at will.\nD.I.

    "content": "FELIX Cross Country\nThe 17th Hyde Park Rood Relay\nBy D.A. Bonham\nThis coming Saturday, 27th February, I.C. is holding th the\nmost important event in its sporting calendar; I.C. will once\nagain be acting as host to 90 Colleges and Universities. The occasion will be the 17th Annual Invitation Hyde Park Road Relay,\nthe largest of its standard anywhere in the world.\nMore than 500 runners\u2014six to\na team\u2014will run a3 mile lap of\nthe park, among them will be as\nusual some of the famous names\nof athletics and also potential in-ter nationals. Entries include all the first 15\nin the recent U. A.U. champion-ships: J. M. Jackson, Liverpool,\nFergus Murray, Edinburgh, Yates\n\u2014U. C.,S.P. Mikell, last year top\njunior 3 miler, and the inevitable\nM. Turner who first entered in\n1960 and holds the lap record.\nThe race was originally thought\nup by 3 I.C. runners\u2014T. Watts\n(7 times 440 yd s. Champ.) R. Gigg (who ran the fastest lap in\nthe inaugural race), and A. Br6wn.\nI.C. won that first race in 1949\nfrom a field of eight others !\nInterest in the event grew\nrapidly. By 1954 there were 27\nentries including two or three\nOxbridge Colleges (thus making\nit socially acceptable]) Big names\nbegan to appear in the pro-gram me; that year Martin Hyman\nran for Southampton University\nat the start of a career which led\nto international and Olympic performances and the U.K.6 a nile record.\nIn 1959 I.C. came second to\nLiverpool out of a field of 42.\nIn doing so they beat a very\nformidable team from Southampton which contained both Hyman\nand Bruce Tulloh. Ron Hill,\nU.K.6 mile record, also entered\nthat year for the firs j time with\nManchester University. The entry\nshot up in the next two years.\n1960 saw 70 teams line up for the\nstart, among them an all-blue\nteam from St. Catharine's Oxford\nand individuals such as Tulloh,\nTurner (who again broke the lap\nrecord last year), Tim Briault and\nT. Shoefield. Durham actually\nwon and I.C. were 4th. The following year there occurred one of the most exciting\nraces. I.C. in the form of J. Collins took a five second lead at\nthe end of the fourth lap, and J. Cleator running next, put up the\nthird fastest time of the day and\nincreased the gap to 30 sees.\nHowever, Hill and Turner running for Manchester and Queen's( Cambridge) respectively produced the two fastest laps of the\nday, overtaking G. Wenk, I.C.'s last man, and so pushing the College team into 3rd place.\nRevenge came the very next\nyear when I.C. won for the first\ntime since 1949. There was a record field of 80 including stiff\nopposition such as Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham. In fact\nLeeds had a37 sec. lead at the.\nstart of the last lap\u2014but Collins\nagain produced the third fastest\nlap taking (and keeping) the lead\n\\ a mile from home.\nThe great Herb Elliot was yet\nanother famous athletic per sp nal it y to take part\u2014this must have\nbeen his last serious race before\nhis premature retirement due to\nstudies and a controversy over bis\namateur status.\nDuring the years 1949-62 I.C. were always in the first six. Unfortunately in the last couple of\nyears much of the talent which undoubtedly lies within the college\ncannot find the time to take part\nin sport, and the position of I.C. dropped to 31st in 1963 and 1964.\nThis years I.C. team, which\nwill probably consist of D. May,\nA. Cope, H. Dickson, A. Bishop,\nA. Walker and a sixth member,\nwho could be chosen from any of\nhalf a dozen, although not in the\nwinning class will undoubtedly\nimprove on recent performances.\nRugby U.L. Cup\nLOSS OF CUP\n\" So near and yet so far,\" was\nthe only thought of forty anguished I.C. supporters as .Chap-pell was pulled down inches from\nthe line in the dying moments, of\nthis Gutteridge Cup semi %\u00bbal.\nBut these were the inches between\nvictory and defeat for moments\nlater the final whistle brought an\nend to I.C.'s cup hopes for this\nseason and Q.M. C. had nosed\nhome by the narrow margin of\n6\u2014S., davison injured\nThere can be no doubt that the\nLC. back division was badly disorganised by an early injury to\nDavi$on but even taking this into\naccount the defence was shaky\narid frequently only forward covering stopped a break through.\nHere Hanjmerton was outstanding\nand in fact in attack and defence\nmust have covered more ground\nthan any other player on the field.\nThe pack more than held its\nown in the scrum s but the line-OUts were another matter, for\nWater Polo\nConvincing Victory\nBy S. Rowe\nThe I.C. water-polo success\nstory continues apace. Collins led\nhis men to a convincing victory\nover a bewildered Bristol University side. Bristol were probably\nnot only worried by I.C.'s super io i\" waterman ship but also by the\nsmall dimensions of the Great\nSmith Street Pool which I.C. have\nbeen forced to use this term. The\nconfined space favoured some of\nI.C.'s less speedy but more robust\nplayers.\nI.C. recently scored two league\nwins in the larger U.L. U. pool\nwhere swimming ability is more\nimportant. In the first match\nGuy's scored a quick goal which\nstirred I.C. out of their lethargy.\nThe irrepressible Stapley equal-is ed with a long range shot in the\nsecond quarter. Randall and\nRowe shared the remaining I.C. goals. Valentine scored three\nvery skilfully placed goals for\nGuy's. Throughout the match\nGray and Davis played well as\nbacks for I.C. The last match, versus St.\nMary's was a shambles. I.C. won\nthis match 5-3 against a poor side,\nthey must not rest on their laurels\ntoo much r Results:\n1st53 Guy's101 Bristol University.\n5-2 St. Mary's Hospital.\nwhile Q.M. C. were frequently\nemployed by the unorthodox and\nrisky tactic of tapping down to\nthe scrum half, I.C. seemed to\ngain possession only to loose five\nyards, and the ball, in the melee\nthat followed. Even before the\nexploitation of this session's new\nrules, set line out techniques have\nbeen a fundamental of forward\nplay, but these only come with\npractice, a thing that I.C. sadly\nlack in this department.\na foot short\nHowever, an the j credit side\nthis was a game that could have\neasily gone either way and in the\nloose the I.C. forwards were remarkably mobile and dangerous.\nAs the game progressed luck\nseemed against both teams.\nQ.M. C. going near with a penalty\nthat hit the cross bar while Turton\nafter a dummy scissors and a fine\nrun almost went over in the\ncorner. However, there was no\nscore until just on half time. Then\nfrom a line out some 30 yards\nout Weisner executed the same\nmove as against U.C. linking up\nwith Davis and Metcalf for the\nlatter to score an excellent try,\nwell converted by Turner. With\nthis lead I.C. exerted early pressure after the restart but QM C weathered the storm, and slowly\nturned defence into attack to score\nsome 15 mins. from time\u2014then\nfrom a Touch near I.C. line\nWeisner received the ball and half\nof the QMC pack at once and out\nof the resulting maul a QM C forward dived over, The tempo\nnow rose to fever pitch where\nit remained as with five minutes to\ngo the QMC scrum half sent his\nside in front with a well-taken\npenalty goal. Turner and the\nrest of his team promptly threw\neverything into a last desperate\nattack sustained alas, in vain until\nthe end.\n\n"

WILLIAMS\nProduction Manager Alan Oxley\nSports Editor Dare Hunt\nLate News Editor Ted Needham\nPhotographic\nEditor John Gawson\nNEWSPAPER\nOF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCirculation, 1700\nN.J. WALKER Business Robin Webster,\nPeter Combes,\nGeoff. Bean,\nBarry Pichler\nAndrew Mayo,\nJocetyn Mackintosh\nProduction Asst. M. Leppard\nSecretary Miss G. Steele\nSales\nMAKING OR BREAKING A STUDENT NEWSPAPER\nWhat are the functions of a Student Newspaper ? Surely, i is\nto provide ar.i cles of general interest, which may be controversial,\nbut should not be sensational, to provide a diary of coming even s, to report on meetings of interest and to provide stories with which\nthe general student is not aware.\nWhat makes or breaks a newspaper is news. News cannot be\nmade out of nothing, but it can be made from any titbit of information which may reach the editorial office.\nLarge portions of National Newspapers are made up with short\nnews items submitted or telephoned by the general public. A student\nnewspaper is not fed with news to this extent; it is, therefore, up to\nthe newspaper to ferret out the news.\nBADGERED SENNET\nSennet this year has tried to make do without news, last term\nit carried \"sensational\" features and its sales rose. This rise is\nobviously too the good\u2014-however, when Tony Berry, UL U President,\ndecided things had gone far enough, where could Sennet turn ?\nFor the last year or more, Sennet has apparently been badgered\nby its Board of Governors with \"do this\" and \"don't do that.\"\nAgain it seems that these directives have often been reversed from\none month to the next. What is the Editor to do ? He is bound\nto be criticised and until a definite policy has been decided by U.L. U.. it is likely that Sennet will wander on from One editor to the next\nand from term to term.\nFELIX ANALOGY A definite general policy should be laid down\u2014as has been done\nin the case of Felix\u2014by the Board of Governors. And Sennet should\nbe given complete free doom within this general policy.\nLast year Felix came under fire from the then Union President\nfor being sensational, which it was, and a motion was put before a Union General Meeting deprecating this. The motion was thrown\nout overwhelmingly.\nA similar fight has taken place recently at King's and L.S.E., with\nthe same result. The general student prefers an Independent newspaper to one all powerful Union Executive. It is a pity that Sennet\nhas no Union to turn to so easily.\nThis is not say that iS en net was a good newspaper last term.\nIt was lousy! But at least jt had something to commend it\u2014sales\nwere high. This term it has nothing\u2014no news, sensationalism is\nverb o ten and sales are tumbling.\nNEW ORGANISATION NEEDED\nA University Newspaper should be highly organised, it should\nbe flourishing, not only in copy (which Sennet isn't> but also with\nstaff (which again it isn't, issue No. 215 contains yet another appeal\nfor staff).\nThere should be a definite plan for staff with promotion over the\nthree years for worthy members and with the Editor and Managing\nDirector drawn from its own ranks. The Editor should be elected\nfor a whole academic year (preferably with a year's leave of absence\nfrom his academic work.\nIt is impossible to run a weekly paper with a new editor each\nterm, especially with a new editor with little experience of Sennet,\nlet alone student journalism. Sennet is bad not because of the last\nlew editors, but through the fault of the President, Tony Berry.\nUntil the Sennet Board decide a possible general policy and until\nSennet has built up a staff oil two or three in each college as well\nas a central nucleus, there will be no University newspaper\u2014only a weekly rag with a sprinkling of news overshadowed by reams of wet\nuninteresting features.\ncoL COMMENT A recent edition of Gimic, the AScW's publication for postgraduates, contains the following\ninteresting phrase: \" . . . Since the way that we\n(the AScW; bring problems forward for discussion\nwith the College administration is the most reasonable way . . . quietly, firmly and without fuss or\npublicity.\" We live and learn.\nIt is pleasant to be able to record a vote of\nthanks to the Beit refectory staff for the excellent .quality of the meals now available there.\nIn wishing Mr. Mooney a speedy recovery from\nhis recent operation, I hope that his return will\nherald a similar improvement in the food standards in Southside.\nI hear that the RCS Carnival on March 5th is\nincorporating some of the \"' new look \" ideas I suggested last term. With four rock groups and\na steel band, none of whom have been heard at\nCollege before, and entertainment going on until\na later hour in the morning (followed by break-fast), it should once again become the best \" value\nfor money \" event of the year.\nHUMOROUS APATHY \u2014 AN APPEAL The word apathy has been bandied about a lot\nrecently. Let's get this straight. The whole idea\nof a university is that, unlike school, a student\nhas a completely free hand to decide how he uses\nhis spare time. If he wants to spend all of it\nworking, then that is up to him, but there is\nnothing v wrong about this. AH the Unions can\nsay is that they think that a greater number of\npeople could enjoy themselves more, and get more\nout of their brief passage through college, if they\ntook, part in some Union, Club, or Society activities. From my experience, especially of people\nwho have \" come into \" Union life late in their\ncourse and wished they had done so earlier, I'm sure this is true. Admittedly Union meetings are\na slightly different kettle of fish\u2014members have a duty to express their views on policy at meetings,\na duty that might be felt more keenly if people\nhad to pay their membership subscription out of\ntheir own pockets!\nFinally, a plea for more humour! People\nseem to me to be taking themselves far too seriously these days. It is possible to be humorous\nwithout being frivolous, and there is nothing like\na touch of humour to put the whole business of\n\" 'Union Politics \" into the right proportion. We\nare not, after all, debating the affairs of the world,\nhowever much some people would like to.\ncuT T HALDANE LIBRARY\n13, Prince's Gardens\nSorry!

    "content": "FELIX5 Carnival\nDick Smith and his all-star\ngroup, the R.C.S. ents. committee,\nhave put in a lot of effort to make\nthis the best Carnival ever, not\nto mention Fletcher and his cabaret writers (remember \u2014 don't mention Fletcher). Let's support\ntheir efforts to make this more\nthan an ex ended hop by turning\nout in appropriate dress. The\ngame this week is \"guess the\ntheme.\" Reserve Friday, March\n5th, for the Carnival and Saturday for a good kip.\nUnion Mee'.ing\nThe President's efforts to confuse us into thinking we'd voted\nnot to debate but to discuss the\nmotion that \" R.C.S. Union offers\nnothing to the majority of its\nmembers\". failed,when the Zoology Rep. treated us to one of his\nV6rbal bombast s( bombast=in-flat ed talk; verbal bombast=twice\nas much inflated talk). Wal op-posed, then Needham decided to\npropose it. WE voted that the\nmotion be put, voted that it\nshould not be put off and proceeded to the next item on the\nagenda. Objections, a pd the motion was put. Wal opposed a second time but the second er of\npress themselves in, more entertainments in I.C., and, by competition, a sp\"ur to excel rather than\nplod complacently. I think the\ngentleman was thinking of the\nin quo rate I.C.U. Meeting, when\nhe said, \" Let'sni a ke one good\nUnion.\" I.C. is too big to have\nthe spirit of the Constituent College Unions. It is, of necessity,\ntoo formal and serious to entice\nour younger members into par-tic ipa ting. Mascot-whipping may\nnot be the most beneficial activity,\nbut at least it's a start.\nAt the end of it all the abundant\nopportunities offered to those prepared to put some effort in, had\nbeen made very clear by the Sec.\nand his assistant. The motion was\ndefeated unanimously.\nFurzedown\nThe R.C.S. party seemed to be\nenjoyed by all who went especially\nthe teachers-to-be, apparently due\nto a shortage of men in Tooting.\nTrip to the coast next term?\nRumour and publicity even,\nheld that this was to be a tramps\nball. Response to this nomenclature was interesting, Bruce\nCopper in particular excelled.\nHowever the girls thought it war\njust a party. Strange looks wc re; Scene from Union Meeting\nthe motion decided to discuss it.\nThe assistant Sec. ably seconded\nthe opposition again and some\ninteresting but irrelevant speeches\nfollowed from the floor.\nAfter three attempts, the new\nMaths and Physics Soc. President\nconvinced us all of who he was.\nHe told us of the past chaos of the\nSociety, and forecast a new era\nof Maths and Fizzing. Let us hope;\nthat he can live up to it.\nAnother gentleman questioned\nthe necessity for Constituent College Unions at all. The meeting\ndecided to ignore him. Apart from\nthe basis in tradition, surely we\nneed the three Unions. We need\nsmall manageable units, where\npeople know each other, can participate more easily, and benefit\nfrom the experience. They mean\nmore activities and more responsible jobs for the willing to ex-our lot for some twenty minutes\nuntil the explanation went round;\nthe barrels felt this most though.\nExit Wal for\" n\" pip kin s at 9.30.\nA swinging evening marred only\nby the unknown gentlemen(?)\nwho chose to hide one of our six\ncrates in the bog and consume it\nthere.

    "content": "Archbishop\nThere is something wrong with\npeople who aspire to be .Chris-tian s but are not Humanists, and\nthere are more difficulties than\nsolutions for those who claim to\nbe Humanists but not Christians.\nThis was the underlying message conveyed by His Grace the\nArchbishop of Canterbury when\nhe visited IC on Tuesday, 9 February, to deliver a General Studies\nlecture to an audience of 500 in\nthe main Physics Lecture Theatre.\nUndoubtedly, this was the highlight of the Anglican Chaplaincy's Teaching Week.\nCont. p.2 inside Careers Supplement\nOn Tuesday, 9th March, the University Grants Committee will visit Imperial College. IC\nUnion has prepared a memorandum, which has been presented to UGC and the Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Grants based on a survey recently carried out by year representatives. Felix reports\non their findings.\nSTUDENTS DEMAND DETTE D DEAL Increase Grants!\nWhile the present full term-time grant to undergraduates is\ndeemed to be adequate, paid\nwork has to finance the vacations.\nTo those whose parents are unwilling or unable to supplement\ntheir grants, however, the Means\nTest brings hardship, and its\nabolishment is urged.\nThe differential between halls\nand lodgings should be at least\nreversed, and the London allowance raised above Oxbridge.\nNational Insurance payments,\ntoo, are condemned.\nPostgraduates have a lower\nstandard of living than under-graduates, and their present\ngrants are grossly inadequate. IC\nUnion calls for an ex jr a London\nallowance, an annual increment,\nincreased demonstrating fees, and\na yearly review.\nN.U.S. WE'RE IN ?\n\"Scapegoat\" Utting was exonerated, President Price flopped,\nand the Imperial College joined, en masse, the National Union oi\nStudents in the most lively Union Meeting of the year last Thursday.\n279 voted in favour of Mike Edwards' motion to join NUS, 215\nopposed, 3 abstained, and five spoiled their ballot papers.\nBut this will certainly not be the last that ICU has heard of\nNUS this term. 130 sign a tees will doubtless call for an Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting within a month at which to reverse this decision.\nIn our last edition we criticised the pro-NUS team for their lack\nof organisation. It would appear from the Union Meeting, however,\nthat those against ICU joining NUS have not even got a team, let\nalone organisation. C.P. Burdess, who spoke first for the opposition,\nwas both unwilling and prepared to address the meeting. But no\narguments put either for or against the motion were novel.\nAN EYE TO THE CLOCK\nThe decision to vote on NUS-membership came after a stormy\nha F hour sparked off by John Tutelman, ex-Chairman of the Jewish\nSociety, who, with an eye to the clock, said, \" Now is the time to\nstab.\" But Des Kearns, President of Mines, had other ideas, and\ninterposed, considering that the motion warranted a change in the\nICU constitution.\nIf this was so, then it was soon brought home to the Executive,\nin particular by Angus Bentlev of 3ME, that the house, considered\nthem at fault for accepting the motion as otherwise when it was\ntabled. Amid the tantrums, however, Dave Bishop, portly President\nof-Guilds, non chant ly collected a stiff orange squash, which he diluted\nwith precision,\nOpinion of his poor chairing was such that Norman Price was\nforced to vacate the chair and submit his gown to Deputy President\nBarry Mair. The change of leadership caused Kearns to withdraw\nhis motion, and the original motion was put to the vote.\nFor rest of Union Mee'ing see back page.\nBetter Teaching\nA controlled distribution of\nlecture notes is advocated, so\nallowing more emphasis to be applied to the understanding of the\nsubject. Better teachers, too, are\nrequired.\nThere is a drastic need to lessen\nthe impersonal aspect of -higher\neducation by the encouragement\nof personal tutorials and semi-nar s. Silwood\nSince UGC's last visit there has\nbeen a50 per cent, increase in\nthe number of students working\nat Silwood Park. A can is now\nput out for more residential accommodation and increased\nsocial and recreational facilities\nthere.\nSouth Kensington\nHalls of Residence must be\ndoubled in the next ten years.\nMany small rooms for informal\nclub in e eing s are wanted. A hall to seat more than 300 people\nwill be built in the new College\nBlock.\nThe delay in the building of\nthe Sports Centre is condemned.\nThe four squash courts it will\nhouse will be inadequate. Mori\nthan four tennis courts would be\nwelcome. And a large gymnasium area would be of immense\nbenefit; the basketball, b admin ton, volleyball, boxing, judo and\nfencing clubs would gain a home\nground; netball and indoor tennis\ncould be played.\nTwo or three small soundproof\nmusic rooms and a workshop are\nalso urgently required, Di w.

    "content": "FELIX3 THE MISFITS\nby Chris Cooper\nNow that (his College has adopted the Notting Hill Housing\nTrust as its Carnival Charity, it is appropriate that we should hear\nas much as possible of the dispossessed and outcast, and for the work\nbeing done to help them. Homeless families are only part of those\nbeing aided by the Simon Community, whose Director, Anton\nWallich-Cliffiord\u2014plain \" Anton\" to the Community\u2014spoke i \u00bb the\nCollege during Christian Teaching Week.\nThere is a class of people\u2014officially recognised in Scandinavia\nand parts of the U.S. \u2014who are constitutionally incapable of rehabilitation as the Welfare State understands it\u2014who, when they are\nrequired to rely on themselves for survival in society, break-down and\nbecome the meth s drinking down-and-outs of the bomb-sites and\ndos s houses.\nThe Simon Community offers them a second,chance by taking\nthem first into its houses, like St. Joseph's, in Maiden Road, and then,\nwhen they have progressed far enough, via a halfway house, to its\nco-operative farm Simonwell.\nAt these places, helpers and\nhelped do not form a\" we \" and\n\" they \"; they live alike, each getting his \u00a3la week pocket money.\nThese ventures are supported\nby the voluntary contributions of\nthe \"Companions of Simon,''\ngroups of private people all over\nthe country, and indeed, the\nworld; and more recently, by\nChristian Action's\" Homeless-in Britain\" Fund.\n,The Community do not like\n\"Society\"; they say that it creates\nthe misfit, by demanding that the\nindividual should conform to it,\nand not society to the individual.\nDaily they are proving that other\nways of life are possible.\nTRY A STOMP...\nThe Southside Stomps are\nreally rather unique. Whether\nyou come to listen, to dance, or to\nq rink, is irrelevant. What matters is that you relax and enjoy\nthe atmosphere, for there is something quite different about it\u2014in\nfeet no other college jazz club I 've\n\\s sited this term has bad this\nessential atmosphere.\nThis week, is somewhat differ-ent, too, in that three bands will\nbe playing during the evening, the\nfirst being the lively traditional\nstyle Royal Garden Stampers.\nCHINESE SOCIETY\nMusic Night\nAfter a series of successful\nevenings on culture, home cuisine,\nfilms and the New Year dinner,\nthe Chinese Society is going to\npresent another great and unique\nitem\u2014a Musical Evening. This\nwill take place in the Upper Refactory, South Side at 8.30 p.m. Monday, March 1st. Entertainment will be provided\nby 8 artists from Hong Kong and\nMalaysia in a programme of\nmostly Chinese Music, plus a few\nextracts from Italian Operas. The\nevening will have an Oriental at-;\nmo sphere and refreshment will be\nserved after the concert at a low\nprice. Come along and enjoy\nyourself.

    "content": "FOCUS Exploration\nSociety\nFELIX The I.C. Exploration Society is reputed to be the most active\nsociety of the type in the country. Yet the average student at I.C. may find this hard to believe, for the society does little to publicise\nits activities within the coU e ge. Several meetings are held each term to which guest speakers\nare invited. In principle, these meetings also provide a platform on\nwhich people with common interests can meet each other to exchange\nideas and information. In practice there is little opportunity for\ninformal discussion; but the annual dinner in February does much\nto stimulate social activity within the society.\nTHE EXPLORATION BOARD\nNaturally enough the society centres around the organisation of\nexpeditions. Details of proposed expeditions are made available to\nmembers; and if there is enough support a detailed report Of the\naims and cost of the expedition is prepared. This is submitted to\nthe Exploration Board, who undertake to give financial assistance,\nwhere possible, provided they are satisfied that the expedition is\ngoing to undertake scientific work (thinly disguised revelry is not\nacceptable!).\nBecause the Board have only limited funds at their disposal they\ninsist that detailed proposals must be submitted to them by December 8th each year, so that expedition organisers can know well in\nadvance just how much assistance they will receive. To ease the\nfinancial situation and to discourage frivolity every member of an\nexpedition is expected to provide a minimum of \u00a350 out of his own\npocket. Society would stand to become\nTWO-WAY HELP one of the most vigorous and\nOnce an expedition has been stimulating societies in the col-approved it can take advantage leg e. of several other facilities laid on\nby the Society. A certain amount\nof equipment (tents, sleeping bags,\nice picks, etc.), is loaned and provisions are bought in bulk at discount prices. Much information\nis also available as to which firms\nare generous with their complimentary samples.\nOn their return, expeditions\nare required to prepare a summary report of their investigations by November, and a full report must be drawn up during the\nfollowing year. The summary\nreports, which are particularly\nuseful to the organisers of future\nexpeditions, are made available\nto members of the society, and\nthe full reports eventually come\nto rest in the Haldane Library.\nASTOTJNDINGLY SMALL\nFor a college of this size, the\nmembership of the Exploration\nSociety's is astonishingly small.\n(Last year there were only 35\nmembers.) The Society is at present trying to attract stronger\nsupport by inviting famous personalities (e.g. Sir John Hunt) to\nspeak at their meetings, and by\naiming to produce a bigger and\nbetter version of their already excellent Exploration Review.\nBut perhaps they would also do\nwell to review their publicity ar-range ment s. The impressive attendance at their recent talk on\n\" Survival\" demonstrated just\nhow effective good publicity can\nbe. If as much publicity Were\ngiven to proposals -for forthcoming expeditions, then no\ndoubt the membership figures of\nthe Society would begin to reflect\nthe students natural interest in\nforeign travel. And if, for ex-ample, an informal discussion\nover coffee could be organised\nafter each meeting so that members really could get to know\neach other, the Exploration\nM.

I5th-^\u2014\u2022\u00a3/n identified Flying\nObjects, by Mr. Gordon Creighton (ex-British Intelligence).\nThe large and initially sceptical\naudience was visibly impressed\nby Mr. Creightoitfs all but conclusive evidence for the presence\nof extra terre sti al craft on our\nplanet\nA Texas policeman on patrol\nsaw a large object off the road\nat a lonely spot on his route. On\napproaching the object on foot he\njudged it to be about sixty foot\nlong and standing on four cantilevered legs. Three short human\nlooking individuals entered the\ncraft on his approach, and the\ncraft took off with a huge belch\nof flame. Investigators returned\nto the spot and found a burnt\npatch in the scrub and four indentations substantiating the\npoliceman's statement and concurring with his estimate of the\nsize of the craft.\nThe cn ances that a normal and\nwholly reliable person should perpetrate such a fraud are small,\nand though many obviously\nfraudulent reports are made, the\nenormous frequency of reports\nfrom varied sources around the\ning to get people used to the\npossibility of the visits of intelligent extra-terre sti al life, but in the\nfree world the restrictions are\nsevere. An American air force\npilot may for instance get up to\nten years in prison for disclosing\nany information on sighted\nU.F. Os. In Brazil, at the con-clu sion 'of a military survey into\nthe matter the officer presenting\nthe resulting evidence has declared\nthat i tell i gent extra-terre sti al visitations may be accepted as a re-ali ty. The cumulative effect of th\u00a7\nevidence put by Mr. Creighton\nwas quite overwhelming and\nreally cannot be dismissed off-hand. The dangers of U.F, Os,\ntriggering off a nuclear war also\nprovide a very real threat.

    "content": "FELIX GRANTS INADEQUATE\nNorman Price\nand David Williams report\nAll year representatives were asked to submit written reports\nof their year's views on lectures, tutorials, practical periods, vacation\ncourses, grant suf fic ien cie s and anomalies and any other matters of\nconcern.\nAt a Union meeting the invitation was extended to anyone, to\nexpress his views on the Union Office. These opinions together with\nthe written evidence formed the basis of a memorandum on teaching\nmethods and grants that went to U.G.C., and a letter on grants that\nwent to SAOG.\nACADEMIC MATTERS\nMany problems were particular to one department and will be\ndealt with by the appropriate bodies in the Constituent Colleges.\nExamples of such problems are the desire for more discussion of\nwritten laboratory reports in Chemical Engineering and the suggestion\nfrom Mechanical Engineering postgraduates for the provision of\na postgraduate common room with refreshment facilities, like\nthat in the Physics department,\nwhich would make a valuable\ncontribution to the departmental\nand social environment. The\nmachinery for dealing with such\ncases already exists in the year\nrep. system and most departments\nare willing to discuss sensible and\nresponsible suggestions.\nOther problems are more\ngeneral and appropriate for comment by the College authorities\nand UGC. Opinions in this cate.\ngory include the need for more\ncontact between students and\nstaff possibly in the form of personal tutorials and seminars ; the\ndesirability that more real attention and less lip service should be\npaid to the function of I.C. as a teaching institution. The possible\ncontrolled distribution of duplicated diagrams, table, proofs, etc.\nto enable the lecturers to concentrate on teaching an under stan ct ing of his subject and opportunities made available to lecturers\nfor refresher coupes on teaching\ntechniques a pd to keep up to date\non scientific discoveries.\nUNDERGRADUATE GRANTS\nThe reports showed that the\ngeneral opinion was that\n1. The full grant is adequate\nfor term-time living but paid\nwork must be undertaken during\nthe vacations. All local authorities should pay expenses for compulsory field courses.\n2. The differential between\nhalls and lodgings is anomalous,\nthe latter being very expensive in\nSouth Kensington. There seems\nno reason why the Oxbridge\nallowance, where the terms are\nshorter and living is cheaper,\nshould be higher than that in\nLondon.\n3. The Means Test should be\nabolished.\n4. There is a definite feeling\nthat National Insurance contributions should not be required\nfrom students.\nPOSTGRADUATE GRANTS\nSome very good, detailed documents were received from the\nP.G. reps and one from Chemistry, in particular, helped enormously in the compilation of a representative report.\nThe recommendations were on\nthe general basis that while one\ndoes not expect nor wish to be\npaid as one's contemporaries in\nindustry, the present DSIR grant\nis insufficient. The detailed recommendations were that:\u2014\n1. Postgraduate grants should.be\nadjusted to give a standard of\nliving higher than that of the\nundergraduate.\n2. Outside earning should be\nsubject to no restriction.\n3. A realistic difference in grants\nshould be made according to\nwhether the individual is living in hall, in lodgings or at\nhome.\n4. A London allowance should\nbe paid.\n5. The age-limits for a de pen dant's allowance should be\nabolished and students should\nbe brought into the National\nInsurance scheme.\n6. A yearly increment should be\npaid as the postgraduate progresses from being trained; to\nperforming original research.\n7. College demonstrating fees\nshould \"be raised to a level\ncommensurate with outside\nrates.\n8. Grants should be reviewed\nannually.\nHALLS OF RESIDENCE\nLiving in a Hall gives a student\ngreater opportunity for those personal contacts vital for scientists,\nand technologists whose work is\nmain lv with machines and figures.\nWith the Colleges situated in an\narea where students may be\nforced to live ten miles from\ntheir work, there is an onus on\nparticipation in extracurricular\nactivities. Every student must,\ntherefore, be enabled to sn end at\nleast one year in hall. The present resident population is about\n20 per cent.; double the present\nnumber (i.e.1,200) will be necessary to approach minimum requirements as the college numbers rise to 4,700.\nTouchstone Weekend by Chris Cooper\nSILWOOD DISARMS\nUnilateralism is still a strong sentiment among our generation\nif those who attended the latest Touchstone Weekend were at all\ntp yl cal. More than 30 people spent the weekend at Silwood Park\nto Ti ear Sir Michael Wright, British delegate at the Geneva Disarmameat Conferences, speak on his experience, and then put forward their\nown untried views.\nSir Michael denied that vested interests in the \" defence \" industries have impeded progress at Geneva; the nations' fears for their\n6w n safety have been more than sufficient. The Russians fear internal\ninspection, the sine qua non of any disarmament agreement, and they\nwant a troika system for command of the necessary peace-keep ig force: i.e.,a veto for the Great Powers. In the end, at least, that\nsanction must vanish.\nThe real problem is what the peace-keeping force will be used\nfor; will it be able to intervene in civil or revolutionary strife in the\ndisarmed nations ?\nUnilateralism by Britain was widely approved, especially by Our\nnon-British contingent; but the idea that it would provide \"moral\nleadership\" in stopping the\nspread of nuclear weapons was\ndismissed as if it had never been\nseriously held. Nobody argued,\neither, with Sir Michael's contention that the money saved would\nprobably go towards an increased\nconventional contribution to\nNATO( meaning, possibly, conscription for you and ~,\ne). but it\nwas felt that we would be freer\nof North American influence in\nforeign policy.\nNobody should spend -three\nyears at this college without going\nat least once to a Touc'is tone Weekend 7 Windsor Park is beautiful in any weather, the conversation is intellectual, and it's a treat to hear the rich tones of Mr.\nMcDowall's peace-keeping voice\nkeeping the temperature down in\ndebate.\n,The next Touchstone Weekend\nwill be tt th Uth, March, when\nMr. Patrick Keattey, Commonwealth Correspondent to the\nGuardian, will introduce the topic\n\" Commonwealth Realities.\"\nSOCIAL FACILUTIES\nThe new open-plan lounges\nare difficult to use for anything\nother than reading newspapers\nand relaxing after meals because\nof their inevitable function as\ncorridor.
