Cup SemiFinal: I.C.1 Goldsmiths College1 It must be admitted th ac the U.L. Cup Semifinal was played under difficult conditions last Saturday an iron hard surface and a bitterly cold wind but this cannot explain I.C.'s atrocious display. Who remembers last years final? Aten man I.C. side completely outplayed a strong U.C. team. What a contest when\nI.C. were fortunate to draw against a team, that can only be\nclassed as second rate in College football. What has happened?\nThe skill is still there for seven of last years all conquering team are still here, but where is that will to' wi h. Oh! the game itself the less said the better. The spirit of the Goldsmiths XI made up for their lack of skill. Briscoe got I.C's goal after a goal mouth scramble and Goldsmiths equalise r must be attributed to faulty covering by the I.C*. defence. Extra time produced no further score. If the Soccer Cup Is to stay with us some of the old dash must be found so\nlet's see I.C. really\" at it\" in the replay. UNIVERSITY HOCKEY CUP SEMI-FINAL.\nImperial College1. University College Hospital0. If only a photograph could have been taken of our team\nafter the game- only nine men left, be spattered with mud, half frozen and almost exhausted but victorious! The cold driving rain and waterlogged pitch made conditions appalling, so good hockey could not be expected.The low score must be attributed to the mud for I.C. were pressing throughout; only a good display by the UGH goalkeeper kept the result in. doubt .So I.C. have\nreached the final without having conceded a single goal, and stand a good chance for the Cup on March 1 st.

    "content": "EDITORIAL\nTHE PAYMENT OF FINES.\nThe repercussions of the November 5th rag are again raising their ugly head. It will he recalled that at an 1.0.\nUnion General Meeting last term Mr. D.C. Howe, who was in the Chair as VicePresident, stated in answer to a question that the fines and the costs would be paid by the Union, and that the funds would be raised by a dance and a voluntary collection. This announcement was greeted with acclamation and apparently general approval, and a highly successful \"whip round\" has\nalready been made on this basis. However, it is now reported that at a meeting of the Executive Committee on January 1 6 th it was suggested' the t the\nUnion should pay the costs, but that the students concerned\nshould pay their own fines. It was held that for the Union to pay the fines would appear as a condo nation of the offence, would set a dangerous precedent, and would act as an incentive to students to break the law in future. The students concerned, and many others, hold strong views about this. They feel that the fact that they were\narrested was in the nature of a luck of the draw, that in many\ncases they were among the lesser offenders, and that they\nwere merely the unlucky scapegoats for police disapproval of what was essentially a College affair. They hold that if the Union pays the fines it will be recognising this, whereas if they pay they will have a permanent blot on their escutcheons. They also claim that if punishment be deemed necessary they\nhave already suffered sufficiently with their protracted anxiety and the indignity of appearing in court on\ncomparatively serious charges. Presumably this matter will now be referred to the I.C. Union Council, but we sincerely hope that the decision given to the General Meeting will not be overruled without further reference to another General Meeting. The sum of money\ninvolved is small, and it Is essentially amoral issue; it is a matter on which opinions differ, and it affects the Union\nas a whole. Surely it should be debated and decided by a General Meeting? FELIX SOBERS UP.\nThere was a criticism of our last issue which appeared\nto be sufficiently general to warrant some comment on this page. It was that the issue was merely a concatenation of accounts of bi bulat ions ucc enc t ly put by one person with the question \"When are you going to squeeze the beer out of Felix?\" We agree with the critics, and apologise. The alcoholic emphasis did not reflect editorial policy, but was purely adventitious. FELIX is what you make it, and it so happened\nthat when the reports came in from our correspondents on their Christmas activities, they had all laid some stress on the intoxicating nature of the occasions. However, Christmas comes\nbut once a year, and FELIX, having had. his orgy of alcoholism, Is now sober and wiser, but not, we hope, sadder. Contributions must be in by the Monday preceding the date\nof the next issue, but it will be a pore cia ted if they are submitted sooner. They should be addressed to The Editor, Felix, I.C. Union. Contributors must supply their names and colleges with their contribution, though they may write under noms de\nplume if they wish. "

    "content": "- 8 -NETBALL MEWS.\nIt may seem strange that netball matches other than those rough, and tumble games with the men are played by a very enthusiastic team. Indeed, these mixed matches, which have caused so much interest, were intended primarily as\npractice. Their usefulness can be measured by the successes\nscored by the women, who have lost only one of their4 league\nmatches and one of their3 ordinary fixtures. The Soccer Club are always dangerous opponents and they\nwere chosen for the first mixed match. In it they ran rings round the women and scored an easy win( This may be due to the fact that the girls do not flourish on carrots at halftime). In the next mixed match, the team was not sure whether\nit was playing the Rugger Club, the Wanderers or. the Philanderers but was sure of its win. Prom a sporting point of view, the best games were provided by the Hockey Club and the hostel. In spite of being unused to handling a ball the Boat Club\ngave a good game, but at half time seven thirsty women watched\nwith dog like eyes those oar bashing brutes knocking back\nmugs of beer and. smoothly scorning the lemons . It is thought\nthat they. regretted it In the second half. The match of the season was the Scruffs v Fluffs. Naturally the Scruffs had no need for personal adornment, but the Fluffs really went to town with all the usual paraphernalia associated with a fluff. The Scruffs just scraped home with a win. The women's team are extremely grateful to the men for playing these matches, for they have certainly improved their speed and team work. Let us hope that there will be many mora\nin. the future and that they will prove their practicality by\nthe women winning atleast one of the cups.\nROWING.\nFrom our rowing correspondent. On Saturday,17 th December, the first four I.C. crews\njoined with eleven crews from Thames R.C. for the latter club's Annual Xmas Eights, better known as the Plum Pudding Eights. This takes the form of a handicap race over Z \u00a7 miles, from\nChiswick steps to Thames Rowing Club flagstaff. The day was\nclear and fine, with a bitterly cold westerly wind which caused difficulties at the start. I.C.I started level with Thames II and had behind them a preview of this year's Oxford boat and also Thames I. The wind\nat the start unsettled I.C. and they did not really get going until the \"Oxford\" crew began to challenge. They then had a really good two minutes row together, solid in the water, and plenty of hard work. Unfortunately they were bau lk ed by a. slower crew ahead and had to steer wide to avoid hitting. This upset their rhythm. Thames I coming up pulled them\ntogether and they finished up with a good row along the wall,a little over a length down on the \" Oxford\" crew and. alongside Thames I.I. C. II seemed to be suffering from the Carnival and had\na bad row, finishing with the tai lenders. I. C.Ill and I.C. IV both rowed w11 and showed plenty of\nfighting spirit. They both refused to be intimidated by\nsupposedly faster crews beside them and fought back with every stroke. I. CIV finished third, and I. C.Ill, with three o thor crews, could not be sep are ted for fourth place. The First Eight showed better form for the time of the year than has been seen in I.C. crews for some time. With the will to work hard and to Improve with each stroke, and with the determination and fighting spirit of the lower boats to spur them on, they may well prove to be a much better crew\nthan some of their immediate predecessors.

    "content": "- 5 -The rest of the proceedings were in the Upper Dining Hall. We understand that some of the Hostel He-men changed\ntheir views on academic societies when they saw all the\nbarrels assembled for this occasion. There were piano and\nsinging solos and some hearty community singing, but the' highlights of the evening were the \"Ceremony of the Clan\" and the sketch \"Your Honey or Your Money\".\nThe sketch was performed by \" volunteers\" from the\naudience, funnily enough, nearly all members of staff. But their efforts were magnificent. Who will forget Sir Jasper\nHardheart as portrayed by Gwyn Thomas? or Dr. Pratt as little Nellie Dean? The audience appreciated too Prof. Brown as\nTrue Blue Harry, and Prof. Hewer as Mr. Dean, not to mention\nDr. Heath as Nick Carton, the Cardboard Cavalier. We could go\non praising them, but must end by praising and thanking the\nCommittee of NHS for this, their best effort to date. BOLUS.\nTHE DRINKING MAN'S GUIDE TO LONDON.\nThe Kings Head and Eight Bells, Chelsea. Any expedition to Chelsea by a right thinking man would\nbe incomplete without a visit to the King's Head nestling in Cheyne Walk between Albert and Battersea Bridges. This little Embankment inn upholds in its' regulars' the last vestiges of a club spirit among the artistic set of\nChelsea; rather a quiet, faintly reminiscent club perhaps,\nwith its members thinned and ageing,but nevertheless a persistent and interesting one\". They s it in the lounge each\nwith their own pot, forming the hard ce re around which the\nrest of the clientele hang. There's the porte r,un mistake able with his jaunty check cap, bifocal spectacles and n pats, who\nboasts that he's drunk in the King's Head since his student\ndays ( his complexion proves that he's certainly drunk very consistently somewhere since then); and with him, usually, a mountainous medical gentleman with a beard and a' dungaree d' sculptress well be smeared with Plaster of Paris. Henry Moore\nis known to this circle and is sometimes with them.\nA warm, cheerful little pub, open from 5.30-10.30, where\nyou can find intelligent talk, and, if you are interested, friendly companions. Add to this good cellars and Whitbread s Ales, and you will make sure that any expedition you may make\nto Chelsea is quite complete! SOCIAL NOTE\nSpring came early to the Hostel this j ear\\ Felix offers sincere congratulations and best wishes to the following fever victims. Miss Mary Mayer & Pete (Bol) Re evil l. Mary as most of you know\nsmokes cigarettes and does research on potatoes but Bol works\nfor his living( in a place called Silvertown in non don believe it or not) and is a distinguished graduate of the 5 th floor. Miss Joyce Lee & Alan Meigh. Joyce is the reigning Queen of\nICWA and, moreover, a fearless leader of fashion witness the\nattractive new hairstyle which our experts in form us should go with a 'bang'- Joyce expresses her own views on this else where .Alan, is, of course, the Union Secretary and, we suspect,,\na rather senior partner In large jewellers or perhaps he has\na key to the Tower strong room!\nOur President, Paul Gumming, within, the last two weeks! Paul is the subject of this weeks profile and his fiance does not\nlive in the Hostel. Better late than never Tardy congratulations Miss June Mahon\n& Spud Hayter they' requite used to the whole thing by now.\n\n"

    "content": "m4 PROFILE: PAUL GUMMING.\nWhat makes a President of I.C? Is it push, personality or is it just one of those things? No one can really say. Of\nthe last4, no two can he closely compared, except perhaps\nthat they . all are people who seem to be one of us if a little more efficient. Perhaps one may say that, in general, he must\nhave personality, initiative, an uninhibited sense of humour,\na3 en3e for an occasion, and Student spirit. Paul had the initiative to be born in Plymouth of Naval parents in1921 subsequently to achieve an Army commission\nand a dislike of <3u2~; he inhibited his sense of humour by\nliving in Barrow at the same time as Joyce Lee, and launched\nout into Public life by e rte ring Ampleforth College at the age of 9 and the local Public House (officially) at\n18. The war having just started, he joined Vickers Armstrong\nto learn some Engineering before we a i ing his feet out in the\nArmy the following year. Chance remarks lead one to believe that Paul spared no effort to avoid wearing his feet out in his early Army life and soon became a Sub alter n to be shipped young and keen to India in1942. Revelry and gaiety in Poona\nsoon affected a Sub alter n bank, balance, so by dint of much\ndinghy sailing and pleasure trips Paul secured a move further East and 3 pips. Here by following closely the relevant Instruction books he managed to build a road over a mountain\njungle in a month, erect a Bailey Bridge on the U hk rul road, walked fabulous distances for which he was\nmentioned in Dispatches and got a job as an Instructor back\nin Poona'. Peter Arnold and Ted Green, as trainees there,have\nPaul to thank for their present maths difficulties, for he\nwas then enjoying \u00a31000 a year - ar.d who can lecture maths\nafter an evening or two in Poona on that income?\nThe end of the war cut the 1000 by about 5 and put Paul once again on the wrong side of the lecture table. Very soon\nhe became involved, in seemingly insignificant affairs compared\nwith Burma jungles, and after Secretarial work for the Rugby\nClubs he became a member of the Links Club and won his first electoral triumph in becoming Hon. Sec. of C&G. His rise became more rapid with the election of Bon Hud dart to I.C. Presidency and Paul became President of C&G. Soon afterwards he sprained his ankle and Doc Sparkes broke Paul's wrist at\nRugby. This couldn't deter his succession to Don Huddart's post, there to control the galaxy of Clubs, Societies and\nCommittees in this busy network of activity and to peer at us\nthro' a battery of microphones at General Meetings. Whatever makes an I,C. President, it seems that they\ndon't lack in brains( for a J. st seems indicated), nor indeed in personal attraction, for Paul's name appeared on Tuesday\nin the engagements column of the \" Telegraph\" and today, we\ntrust, in\" Felix\". Let us wish him the success and good\nfortune in his married life that has come his way so far. R.C.S. NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY.\nThe R.C.S. N.H.S. broke new ground last term by holding a Social for its members. Over 100 gathered in the Botany\nTheatre for a\"ch rta in raise r\",a Brains Trust consisting of\nProfs.Brown and Munro, As st. Prof. Hewer, Dr. Pratt and Mr.\nGwyn Thomas. The questions were both serious and humourous,\none of the latter being on the \"absent minded professor\". Prof. Brown here told a story of a past Professor of I.C. who put\nhis5 children to bed, only to be told by his wife an hour\nlater that they only had 5 chi id\\ en, LA having absent-mindedly\nincluded one of t pen oi gb bo.na I "

Sir, It is of historical Interest to me to learn from your\narticle\" Profile The Bar\" that I had the honour of being the first barman and that I served beer, rolls and sandwiches\non the Lawn outside the Union. Jolly good. Someone has a very vivid imagination of what happened in those days; only It is not true. I should like, if it Is of interest to the present students, to give some facts about the Imperial College Bar. When the Union was being built this room was intended for the Secretary' s office, but Mr. Houghton, the first Secretary of\nthe Union, wanted it for a Bar, and. after much opposition the suggestion of the Union Committee was agreed to and the Bar came into being. At first coffee and sandwiches were served at lunch time as well as beer etc. and a dear old lady called A untie was in charge. After she left other ladies were employed.\nIn 1925 the Rector,& ir Thomas Holland, invited me to take over\nthe management of the Union in addition to my other duties as\nCollege Clerk of Works. I soon discovered that the bar was no\nplace for a woman and when the opportunity came I obtained the consent of the Union Committee for a man to be employed.\nI saw Smith and appointed him as the first No. l Barman and I think you will agree with me that the appointment was a wise one. He has always been the same courteous and obliging servant of the students and long may he continue to be so. Yours sincerely,( signed) JIMMY PEACOCK\nHon. Life Member I.C.U.\"\"\"21,22, Chaps & similar club s.I.C. Hostel'.\nThe Editor>... Felix. Dear Sir, Had you attempted to wear the garments offered in lieu of the more civilized, pants during the recent Dram.Soc.\nproduction you would have appreciated how little room they\nhave even for the wearer, let alone to spare for those elusive shockers called 'amps', which latter, you surely know, are addicted to copper, but not of the helmeted variety. You, Sir, would have been equally jumpy if Inky had refused you permission to wear socks within, the lower\nextremities of these lengthy' step in s'. The nails projecting through the soles of the ornamental bedroom slippers I was expected to wear were more\nample source of jumpiness than amps.\nB. J.P. Selkirk Hall,50, Holland Park,\nW.11.27.1.50.
