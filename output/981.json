    "content": "10 Clubs and Societies\nImperial Rowers In The Buff\nThis summer, five students from Imperial\nCollege represented Great Britain at the World\nStudent Games in Buffalo, USA. They made up\nthe largest single group from any one University\nin the Men's Rowing Team.\nImagine a university the same size as\nImperial College, where there are no lectures, no\nproblem sheets and no exams. The sun shines\nthe whole time, and all the students are in peak\nphysical condition! Everyone you meet is very\nfriendly and helpful - they cater for your every\nneed. Sounds good?\nThe university is also surrounded by an eight\nfoot barbed wire fence, and the entrances and\nexits make airport security look like revolving\ndoors. But that doesn't stop the Cuban students\nfrom defecting at a rate of one every other day!\nThis strange place only exists for two weeks\nevery two years and is home to the 'World\nUniversity Games 1993'. Imperial College has\nbeen represented by rowers on the last three\noccasions that rowing has been included.\nThe World Student Games is a curious event,\nand is sometimes referred to as the 'student\nOlympics', which isn't surprising as this years\ncompetitors included many 1992 Olympians.\nDespite this link with amateur sport, as in all\nother areas of sports, it is clearly obvious that the\nbounds of 'amateurism' are being pushed further\nback. For example, eight of the eleven British\nfootballers from the last Games signed\nprofessional contracts as a result of their participation and one of the Cubans who defected this\nyear leapt over the fence in the middle of his\nbaseball game into a waiting car to sign his new\ncontract!\nSo why does the event get so little publicity?\nDespite the high level of competition, the\nStudent Games fail to generate enough spectator\ninterest; this year Buffalo was unable to secure a major television contract. Despite using\nvolunteers and sponsors to run the whole event,\nthe host city still made a huge loss. Yet cities are\nstill queuing up for the financial liability, the\nreason being that it gives them an un surpass able opportunity to build extensive sporting facilities\nand accommodation.\nHowever, it is very important to point out\nthat, apart from being a financial exercise, the\nreal reason for its existence is to give students\nworldwide the opportunity to meet others with\nsimilar interests and compete on a friendly basis.\nThis is something that I was very priv el edged to\nbe part of, a real 'once in a lifetime' experience\nthat all of us will always value.\nThe rowing events were held in St\nCatherine's, Ontario - the home of Royal\nCanadian Henley Regatta, which is just over the\nborder from Buffalo. The course was on a short\nstretch of river close to Niagara. This meant that\nthe water was flowing and therefore had to be\ndammed on race days. The lack of water current\nallowed weeds to float to the surface making the\nlanes unfair, which led to some heated\narguments between the team officials and the\norganisers, which were eventually resolved.\nSo how did we get on?\nThe selectors managed to achieve their\nobjectives, with all the crews reaching the finals,\nalbeit with some pretty inconsistent performances. The final day promised to produce some\nexciting racing, with all the British crews still in\nthe hunt for medals.\nFirst were the relatively inexperienced Coxed\nFour. They were always struggling in their final\nand as the powerful Romanian Olympians pulled\nthe field apart, they found themselves seperated\nfrom the battle on the other side of the course.\nDespite the vocal support from the rest of the\nteam at halfway, they could only manage a creditable sixth place.\nThe Lightweight Double Scull performed\nwell in an event which the British are not\ntraditionally good at, achieving a fine fifth place.\nThe Lightweight Men's Coxless Four were\nup against a good French crew, who they had\nbeaten previously at Paris. Leading in the final\nstages of the race, the British crew were unable\nto contain the French, who broke through just\nbefore the line. Two of the Brits collapsed with\nexhaustion and were unable to collect their silver\nmedals at the ceremony.\nIn the last race of the Regatta, the Men's Eights main rivals were the American and\nCanadian crews. The USA made the early pace,\nwith the British in a comfortable second place.\nThe Canadians began to drop back as the crews\npassed halfway. However, the British crew were\nunable to find another gear to pass the leaders,\nand had to settle for the silver medal.\nOverall the team performed very well, with\nanother silver medal and a sixth place. This is\nnot only a reflection of the high standard of\nBritish Rowing, but also the superb team\nmanagement of Gerald Gregory-Jones, the\nUniversities Athletic Union Chief Executive,\nand the other coaches.\nOur trip was only made possible with the\nhelp and support of the following people, to\nwhom we are extremely grateful: Bill Mason\nAIC, Sir Eric Ash, Peter Mee, and Liz Carr. Our\nthanks also to the Union, the ACC, and all the\nother members of ICBC.\nHHHHH\nit\nFancy working overseas this summer? See page 15 for details\n\n"

The\nman, who cannot be named, wired\ninto the British Telecom system in\norder to avoid paying international\nphone charges. Before being\ncaught, he is alleged to have made\nover \u00a319,000 worth of calls to\nMalaysia, mostly at night.\nThe man had previously studied\nfor an MSc degree at Imperial\nCollege, which he failed despite\nhigh marks in project work.\nAfter discovering the fraud,\nBritish Telecom traced the calls to\na house in Earls Court Square,.\nwhich had been previously\noccupied by the ex-student. The\npolice and Imperial College\nsecurity were brought in, and a suspect identified.\nA stake-out was set up in order\nto watch the house, which the man\nhad vacated in September. In the\nearly hours of Sunday Morning,\nwhile a call was being made,\ntechnicians disconnected the phone\nline to the house. A short time later,\nthe man emerged from a neighbouring house and attempted\nto reconnect the line. He was\narrested and taken to Kensington\npolice station.\nThe man could not be charged\nimmediately as he fell asleep in the\nstation while waiting to be\nquestioned. As police codes of\npractice prevent the waking of\ndetainees, he was ordered to return\nfor questioning on Wednesday. The\nman was formally charged of fraud\nyesterday.\nSir Frank Cooper, Chairman of\nImperial College's Governing\nBody, celebrates his 71st birthday\non Thursday. Felix wishes him\nmany happy returns.\nThe deadline for articles is Friday at 6pm "

    "content": "Reviews 21\nTom Waits\nThe Black Rider\n\"Fearless, tireless, insane and capable of going\nto deep profound places\" writes Waits in the\nliner notes about his new collection of songs,\n'The Black Rider'. Certainly this album takes us\nto familiar Waits territory - crumbling love\nsongs, peculiar narratives and plain weirdness -although it's less clear as to whether he's succeeded in these claims. Like last year's excellent 'Bone Machine', 'The Black Rider'\nhas a rough spontaneity. Most of the songs were\nhot housed over a few nights in Hamburg with\ncollaborators Greg Cohen and Gerd Bessler.\nSuch experiment techniques suit most of Waits'\ncompositions admirably.\nWilliam Burroughs makes his presence felt\nthroughout the album, writing texts on which the\nalbum was based and also taking a star turn on a couple of songs. I can see it now, Burroughs as\npop star, dueling on Frank Sinatra's next album\nand touring with Sonic Youth.\nSo there we have it. Reality presented by a drunken hobo and a ninety year old cult writer. I think they come pretty close. (8)\nJF\nReleased on Island\nA111 Velvet\nUnderground\nLive MCMXCIII\nLou Reed has succumbed to Dylan syndrome,\nthe blatant disregard of the original melodies\nand vocal in flex ions which ingrained themselves in your mind, and said what the band\nwere all about. Perhaps this is because he's Lou\nand is a positive statement against stubborn\nbuffoons who expect a completely retro sell-out.\nJohn Cale actually admitted early on that he was\nin it for the money. It's initially patience testing,\nbut this is more to do with the fundamentally\nconservative part of human nature.\nWith John Cale covering all the Nico parts,\nthe haunting qualities have been diminished, but\na certain Welshness has been added to it that\nallows Nico to truly rest in peace. Incidentally,\nhis epic 'The Gift' was also delivered\nbeautifully, while his lamenting viola is nothing\nshort of stunning.\nMoe Tucker steals the show quite easily with\nher intriguing 'After Hours', perhaps closest to\nthe original; all the charm with a slightly fuller\nbacking. I will always rate Moe, partly because\nof her original androgynous mystery, but also\nbecause in the 80s she sang with cynical wit,\n\"I 'll pay rent till the day I die, that's my share of\nthe American Pie.\" The seminal woman who\nmade female drummers just as cool.\nThis Paris recording is just for posterity, a once volatile group getting together for old\ntimes' sake. For some reason I can see them\nbackstage, staring into the middle distance and\nwistfully reminiscing about those hazy days.\nAnd as for Andy Warhol, all I can say is Valerie\nSolanas. (7)\nCamille\nReleased on Warner\nBuffalo Tom\nBettie Serveert\nThe Forum\nBettie Serveert are from Amsterdam. It's a foreign sound (there I 've said it) US or British\nbands wouldn't attempt it. Their songs should be\nset as case studies for musical structure. To be\nable to build a spiralling song, change tempo\nmid-stream and employ false endings without\ngrinding teeth, these are people to build a philosophy of music - existentialism within\nsomeone's reach. Forget that the guitarist is a left-over from the peroxide punk era. If you\nhave something to say, take me along to. That's what they do and I don't even like all their\nsongs. Another speckled set but one which is\nglorious in its expanse. Only Madder Rose have\neclipsed them live so far this year.\nThe headliners are on stage, Buffalo Tom, the\ncollege geeks who made it beyond. Bill's resplendent with sensible cardigan and Chris in\na pleasant jumper, they're Pavement's saner\nfetch and it shows. It's been said that they\n\"make such a virtue of the unspectacular\". Right\non one count. A diet of steak and fries is as\nAmerican as apple pie but Buffalo Tom are only\nhanding out single portions. No grand vision,\njust play the song. Yes, the crowd go wild but\nthey paid to do that. I want to be taken inside\nmyself but Buffalo Tom are an alternative\nplaying Kiss. It's tepid and only the encore with\n'Torchsinger' really shows that there is any\nAmerican psyche at work. That was worth my\ntime but the rest, it just trailed off in the end.\nTintin\nTom Waits - Mephistopheles, darkness and the\nwhole cursed shooting match\nCranes\nAstoria 2\nMist-garlanded and walking on light, the Cranes\ncome out to play. This is how it will be; we'll\ndance on the edge of our yawning graves and\nrace thunderstorms through moonlit church-yards, a tale whispering on the wind...\n...but no. The fragile beauty of Alison\nShaw's voice is drowned in guitar feedback and\ndistortion; what should be portentous seems\nmerely pretentious. There are moments of\nrapture, the single, 'Jewel', and the predatory\nguitars of 'Adrift', but it's not enough. The\nencore is curiously muted, only 'Starblood'\npulls us down with its ominous undercurrents.\nThe lights come up, exposing our dream\nhouses as the tawdry things they are, cheated by\nthe day. Perhaps I shouldn't hope for\nen toxic a ting night blossoms in a garden like\nthis, I don't know, but if you'll excuse me I think I hear the wind calling.\nJoe\nBaby Chaos\nSperm\nI don't want to waste your time, here's two and\na half minutes of raucous riffing which knows\nwhere it's going. Eeek, indie with a road map.\nBaby Chaos are going to rake up the plaudits\nwith an album of this stuff. But, back in single\nland, 'Sperm' and especially a funk headed\n'Tongue' are just the start of their motorway.\nTintin\nReleased on East West\nA Winter's Tale is reviewed on page 19\n\n"

    "content": "18 Reviews\nTenor In Shining Armour\n' JB HB \u2022 1\nHHB|\n\u2022 iii if i HH HI iff If Lohengrin does not attract you with its\nsymbolism, the mythological tale of a knight, in\nliterally blazing armour, gliding in the wake of a swan to the rescue of a distressed maiden, then\nthis staging may only amuse, bemuse and\nultimately annoy you with its apparent banality.\nHowever, the visual metaphors of Tim Albery's new production at English National\nOpera almost always serves the drama. Act II,\nparticularly, is indicative of designer and\nproducer working hand in glove, moving with\ndazzling fluidity and invention between the\nforbidding, sepulchral opening intrigues of\nTelramund and his diabolical wife Ortrud,\nthrough to a spectacular burst of energy and\ncolour for the celebrations of Lohengrin's union\nwith Elsa.\nCertain devices may be refined as the run\nprogresses; Lohengrin's duel with Telramund\nwas clumsy and unconvincing, all very\nobviously carefully choreographed. But the\nproblem of the swan was quite poetically solved,\nan almost angelic creature, the dancer gracefully\nsuggesting loyalty and love in every movement.\nMark Elder was in control of the musical side\nof things and demonstrated a breathtaking\nvirtuosity. He has, for many years been wooing,\naudiences with dramatic, vital interpretations of\nthe Italian repertoire, especially Verdi. Here, he\nbrought these qualities to bear on Wagner's sumptuous score. From the beautifully molded,\nwhispered opening through to the glorious close,\nalmost five hours later, he had the audience in\nraptures. Not since Karl Bohm have I encountered\nsuch an energetic exponent of this repertoire.\nThe orchestra did their best to stay with him,\nwhile the chorus were in remarkable voice.\nThe soloists were competent, with two\nnotable exceptions: the Elsa of Linda McLeod\nwas surely a miscalculation, the voice not having\nthe power required and sounding distressingly\nsquall y above the stave. In contrast John Keyes'\ndebut as Lohengrin is a major event. His voice\nhas the right warmth and lyrical pliancy the part\ndemands. He phrased sensitively throughout,\ncaressing the music of this most romantic of\nWagner's heroes. Despite an obvious tiring\ntowards the end of the evening, the Canadian's interpretation will certainly develop in depth and\nstamina.\nA feast for the eye and ear, although all\nsubsequent performances may not be enhanced\nby the refusal of the curtain to rise at the\nbeginning of Act III, thus temporarily delaying\nthe lovers' intended night of bliss.\ni qq y At the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane,WC2N. Tube:\nLeicester Square. 071 836 3161. Ends 29th December.\nA Muffled Flute\nWould-be opera buffs are usually pretty well-advised to praise the musical virtues of any new\nRoyal Opera House production, while condemning the staging for a lack of imagination.\nBut the new Magic Flute which opened at\nCovent Garden last week turns this maxim on its\nhead; Schikaneder's pantomime cum road-movie\nis well served but, in the pit, conductor Andrew\nParrott short-changes the divine Wolfgang A. Martin Duncan's vivid and intelligent\nproduction refreshingly proves that the phrase\n'something for everyone', so often applied to the\nFlute, doesn't have to be a euphemism for 'you\nwon't like most of it'. The beautiful abstract sets\nin rich purple and bright yellow are filled with\nsymbols (set-squares, windows with wings)\nrepresenting Masonic brotherhood and enlightenment. Too much slapstick can upset the\ndelicate balance between these serious themes\nand the opera's comic interludes, but here\nthere's plenty of wit in the buffo passages: in his\nentrance aria, Peter Coleman-Wright's Papageno\nstands stork-like on one leg while brightly-coloured birds zip across the stage in answer to\nhis pipes. Later the wicked Monostatos,\ncomplete with dangling Oxyrynchus-style\nphallus, prepares an outrageous bondage contraption for Pamina.\nAs the hero Tamino, Kurt Streit struggles\nagainst evil, ignorance and a sadistic cost umi er to achieve initiation and a decent outfit with\nsymbolically rolled-up trouser leg. He has a winsome voice, but from very early on it's obvious he's not going to get the support he\nneeds from Andrew Parrott and a severely\npared-down orchestra, who completely ignore\nStreit's attempts to raise the temperature and the\ndecibels at the climax of the portrait aria. Clarity\nis all very well and there is indeed plenty of it\nright from the crisp overture, but no sense of\ntheatrical ebb and flow, no build-up of tension\ntowards dramatic focal points, ever disturbs the\ndeliberate, even tread of Parrott's conducting.\nIt's all too quiet and well-manicured; only at the\nvery end does the distinctive burr of the\nvalveless trumpets make its mark.\nPatrick Wood\nRoyal Opera House, Bow Street, WC2E.

Wanna chat to Juliana?\nDoo-dee-doo-do oo doo-dee-doo-do oo... you\nare now entering a world where things are not as\nthey seem. Felix cannot talk to Juliana Hatfield\ncan it? The Sharon Stone of the grunge world?\nThe Venus of a thousand indie sad do floppy\nfringed boys' lustful stares? Make that a thousand and one to be honest -1 accept with a slobber. But where to stay? Billie! My old friend\nwho's working in Cambridge. The it i nery is\ncomplete. A weekend away from this slimy\ngrime heap. In fact, forget the Felix office, a week out of London!\nBut what do I take? Tape recorder, money,\ngiant inflatable hammer, there's no room to pack\nit all. Well, a boy has to be prepared. Luckily I forget my suitcase when I leave to meet Marc.\nLuckily because my lift has fallen through. I arrive at the rendezvous, conspicuously sans Mr\nCalloway. I phone him up. \"Oh God, sorry\nOwain,\" he says, \"We're not going up until\nSunday now. Louise is very ill.\" Yeah right, I can hear her groaning in the background. Okay,\nbut I can still get a lift back. Now, to hitch or to\ntake the train?\nHitching to Glastonbury this summer was one\nof the most exciting, vibrant, life-affirming\nthings I 've ever done. Life-affirming because I regularly screamed mentally \"Oh Lord, I'm going to die\" and, although by some flukey\nphilosophical trick I didn't,I'd come too close.\n(To the articulated lorry in front usually.) Not\nworth it, not whilst my Juliana awaits me. I make my purchase at Kings Cross, very\nlife-affirming too, and afterwards I go and buy a ticket to Cambridge. The train ride up is deathly\nboring but this is supposed to be a true and\naccurate reflection of my weekend, my life. So,\nfor completeness, it was an experimental version\nof the Japanese Bullet train, there was a murder\n(Morse) (okay - dot dot dot dash dash..), Peter\nSellers turned up to investigate and brought a pink panther, the nice goatee d man sold me\nsome more pretty sweets and I almost married a manicurist from Pittsburgh but she ran off (on\nher excellent cuticles) with Sellers at Bridge\nHead South. The train pulls in and I disembark.\nCambridge is full of students. Unsuprising, I know, but most of them were from IC! Me and\nBillie are just driving over them as we bicycle to\nhis house. His abode is damp, cold and smells of\nold socks so I put my shoes back on, then it isn't so bad. Actually I put my coat straight back on\nand off we rush, to Juliana, to Fame! We get to\nthe Junction without seeing a single college\n(except Emmanuel, which I mistake for a shopping pre c in t at the time). Oh no, one hour to\ngo! Off to McDonalds to write my questions.\nTo be continued...\n1\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON the best student offer in london!/ minute walk from South Kensington Tube Station!!\nCall:071823896815 A HARRINGTON ROAD, SOUTH KENSINGTON, LONDON SW73 ES\n\n"

    "content": "6 Feature\nI was thirteen when I got my first Giles cartoon\nannual for Christmas. That was in 1971 and it set\nme on a quest taking fifteen years to complete.\nMy intention was to collect the other twenty\nor so in the series, for this one had made me\nlaugh so much that I ached to see the others. A call to a second-hand bookshop in 1986\nunearthed a number three to complete the\ncollection and I carried it home in triumph!\nAlong the way, I also collected works by\nother newspaper cartoonists, too: Thelwell, Low,\nH.M. Bateman, Searle, The Perishers, Andy\nCapp, I had them all in one of the largest private\ncollections in the country. Alas, stricken by\npoverty some years later, I had to flog the lot.\nMention St Trinians and the Addams Family\nand most think only of films and TV without\nknowing that both began as newspaper cartoons.\nPeople don't realise the power of newspaper\ncartoonists. With a newspaper cartoon, we notice\nthe joke, not the art. With Giles, both stand out.\nA glance into one of his cartoons is a trip into\nanother world - one that probably never existed -that of the ideal British family. Giles' family\ncomprises Mum, Dad, Vera, the Twins, the Son,\nhis devilish friend Larry, (he's the one with the\nblack mop-top) and of course Grandma, the\nrazor tongued, hard-drinking matriarch of the\nclan and undoubted star of the show.\nThree times a week for the last fifty years,\nGiles' family have commented on the news of\nthe day in the pages of the Daily Express. As\nLionel Lambourne says in the exhibition notes,\n\"My Grandma says hang everybody.\" Daily Express, July 3rd1956 future historians of the later half of the 20th Century will find his cartoons indispensable,\nsuch is the power of his art.\nHaving roared at the astringent punchline, the\nnext thing one must do when viewing a Giles\ncartoon is peer into the background. Failure to\ndo so means that one probably misses a dozen\nother laughs. One also notices Giles' tremendous\nskill in drawing streets and buildings. Many's the time I 've looked at one of his cartoons and\nfound myself wanting to jump into it and go into\nthe chemist and buy a tube of the 'Footo'\nointment advertised on the nearby hoarding.\nWhat tickles me most is the way Giles makes\nthe characters swear. They will not actually say\nthe word, but basic lip-reading soon makes it\nabundantly clear what is coming out of the silent\nmouth. How many other artists can do this?\nNone, is the answer.\nArt exhibitions are normally dull affairs. As\none walks around this one, an amazing sound is\nheard. It is the wonderful melody of visitors\nroaring with laughter. Funnily enough, one of\nthe biggest laughs of all is that one can enjoy\nthis historic and hilarious exhibition for only\n\u00a32.50. Don't miss it!\nShaun Joynson\nNational Museum of Cartoon Art, 183 Eversholt\nStreet, NW1. 071 388 4326. Until 23rd December. Admission: \u00a32.50\nThomas Eakins: A Giant Of American Painting\nWith this retrospective, Thomas Eakins\n(1844-1916) has been labelled as one of the\ngiants of American painting. Comparable to\nSargent in that both concentrated on portraits,\nEakins was the gloomy side of the movement.\nHis figures, however close he fought for a realist\ncause, end up being twisted, whereas Sargent\nproduced the opulence of the age.\nEakins started at the Pennsylvania Academy\nOf Fine Arts where his grasp of technical\nreproduction was clear from an early age. Yet it\nwas his contact with Europe which provided the\ndirection for his mature painting. Studying in\nParis between 1866 and 1870, but also travelling\nto Spain, he was influenced by Velasquez,\nparticularly . He wrote \"I have seen some big\npaintings,\" and returned convinced in his realism.\nHis early work accomplished some of the\nfinest studies of outdoor and sporting figures\nthat have been seen. A study of the solo rower,\n'John Biglin', is particularly stunning. The\nmoment of stroke is precisely caught. Even the\nreflections on the water are used as an integral\npart. In a similar vein he encapsulated outdoor\nlife; the synergy between gunner and boatman in\n'Will Schuster and Blackman Going Shooting.'\nhe painted the raw style of the American dream.\nAlthough he was always interested in such\ncompositions, his later years saw a shift towards\nportraits. Yet, as a lecturer at the Academy Of\nFine Arts he also worked with Muybridge in the\nphotographic analysis of motion. The end of the\nexhibition does in fact display some of Eakins'\nphotographs and he is best placed as a link\nbetween the realism of painting and the absolute\nreproduction of the mechanical process.\nOf Eakins' portraits, the largest pictures on\nshow are those of two academics and the better\nknown 'Concert Singer'. Classic as these are\nthey do not express Eakins' full meter. This is\nbest seen in the lipid portrait of his wife. Red\nrimmed eyes and sunken figure combine to\nproduce a wraith like image. Even with more\nhandsome figures, the results were disheartening.\nIn fact many of his commissioned portraits were\ndisliked by the sitters. Realism can always be\nturned either way; pessimism was Eakins' way.\nHis most famous picture is 'The Gross\nClinic', (not exhibited) depicting an operation in\nbloody situ. At the time, 1875, it was seen as\nbeing too strong in its representation. As a realistic scene showing the progressive wonder\nof the then modern medicine, it is unsurpassed.\nEakins even paints himself in; the faithful\nrecorder. Yet it is the fourteen full length\ncanvases of Catholic dignitaries which perhaps\nencompass Eakins most fully; the expense of\nrich red, full-bodied figures and then a slightly\ntwisted visage.\nBy the end of his life, Eakins certainly had\nthings to be bitter about. He lost his lecturing\nposition when he removed the loin-cloth from a male model in a mixed class. Nudes were not\nconsidered proper in middle-class Philadelphia\nsociety; but nudity was part of Eakins' scheme\nof painting. He himself was part of the Walt\nWhitman group, which encouraged the sheer\nphysical enjoyment in the outdoor pursuits of\nreal men. Scandal was also realised as his niece\ncommitted suicide after living in his house.\nIn his self portrait of 1902, Eakins is shifty,\nuncomfortable and skewed to the frame. It\nreminded me of Munch's self portrait with its\nbackground of cloying smoke. In both, the\npainter is hiding from an unhappy life.\nThis is not a pleasant exhibition to attend, but\nit places Eakins as a figure looking towards the\nuneasiness produced by the fin-de-siecle era in\nwhich he worked.\nTintin\nNational Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place,\nWC2. 071 306 0055.

    "content": "20 Reviews\nlAJ! Quicksand\nSlip\nThe theme for the album is that of rock riffs and\naggressive vocals, reliant on chunky rhythms for\nappeal. But where Rage Against The Machine\nare on occasion fluid and funky, Quicksand\nremain resolutely a rock band, and come off the\nworse for it. There is the odd snatch of a tune,\nbut not enough to rescue the songs from the\n'competent but unexciting' file, which sadly\ngrows ever larger. As if to add insult to injury,\nthe wonderful melody of 'How Soon Is Now' is\nflattened out by the screaming vocalist and, of\ncourse, Jonny Marr's delicate guitar work is\nnowhere to be heard. The best plan for\nQuicksand is to invent a time machine, go back\nthree years, release this album and take the\nworld by storm. Failing that, they must live in\nthe shadow of the rest of the hardcore world.

Recently they\nbegan to bridge the often huge chasm between\nindie and techno. Now Volume 8 has a healthy\n50-50 mix.\nCerebral cog nos centi will not be disappointed as the best in British trance talent, such\nas Autechre and Higher Intelligence Agency, are\nhere, while floppy-haired indie kids will be free\nto masturbate over the newly recorded and\npreviously unreleased Elastica track 'S.O.F.T'. The Sultans of Ping's track is ridiculously\ntiresome, but there is added bonus of an extra\n'hidden' song. They should learn some lessons\nin weirdness from the Butthole Surfers, present\nhere in glorious Technicolor. Other notables\ninclude James and the Wonderstuff, their mixes\nstrive to blur the musical dichotomy.\nBack on the looping front, B12, who gave us\nthe 'Soma', elevate once again with 'Scriptures'\nand Curve just know what it's all about.\nUnplug yourself from conditioned perceptions, listen to Volume and though this has\nbecome an a ff clich6, expand your mind.

    "content": "American Art in the Twentieth Century\n\"It started with a urinal\" claims Marcus Alexanderas he flicks through the\nback catalogue that is the Royal Academy's American Art exhibition. But\nFeature\nDan Flavin, 'A Barrier of Blue, Red and Blue Fluorescent Light' (honest!!)\nThe Royal Academy recently decided to do a series of retrospectives of all of the major art in\nthe 20th Century. An arduous task indeed, and\nthe latest stage is the 'American Art In The 20th Century' exhibition, a veritable feast for all. This\nshow is so vast that it outgrew the halls of the\nAcademy itself and an offshoot was spawned in\nthe Saatchi Gallery featuring the weird and\nwacky experimentation of the last twenty years.\nIt all started with a urinal. Duchamp'sp is so ir confronts you in the first room, as it did in 1913\nwhen an exhibition sent the New York public\nreeling in shock and the New York artists\ndreaming new ideas. Thus, art was born in\nAmerica. The artists experimented and the joy\nthey found can be seen in this first chamber,\nwith works by Man Ray and others inspired by\nthe European trends. Duchamp also features (the\nonly non-American), with his exhibits repeated\nin his 'Boite-en-valise', a box set of miniature\nversions of his works, even a tiny urinal.\nDangling above the cul tourists heads in the\nnext room are mobiles wherein the fourth\ndimension of time first appeared in art. By the\nwalls are tiny boxes of delights, surreal\ncollections of objects. The precision is ts were\ninspired by the new images of America, painting\nskyscrapers, machinery and objects. O 'Keeffe\n(recently shown at the Hayward) painted\nbuildings with bold, mechanically hard-edged\nplanes of colour. Sheeler's 'Classic Landscape'\ndepicts a power station with supreme linearity.\nFor the first time, the American obsession with\nself-glorification appears with brand names and\nAmericana being recurrent motifs in these\nworks, anticipating the later Pop Art.\nAs the cul tourists walk on to the next\nchamber, they see the images crystal lise to form\nthe first American art movement, Abstract\nExpressionism. The arguments about the worth\nof these seemingly random splashes of colour\nwill never cease, but in the flesh they have an\namazing power. Pollock gained fame for\ndribbling paint over vast canvasses in a suicidal\nalcohol stupor. Stare at these random s quir ls and\ncreatures will seem to dance about the canvass.\nIn an octagonal room is a spiritual temple where\nyou can seek enlightenment within Rothko and\nNewman's vast paintings. Beautiful simplicity,\nstare and sink in...\nAbstraction became abstract when Reinhart\npainted black pictures. Three of these are\ndisplayed, all of them black. The narrator\nformed conjunctions in passing. Of course, there\nhad to be a backlash - in fact there were three.\nThe most well known was Pop Art and the most\nderided was Minimalism. Conceptualism was\nthe most conceptual.\nWarhol (The Pope of Pop) and the other stars\nof Pop Art made modern day icons out of\nconsumer goods. Sadly they have now been\nconsumer is ed so much that they have lost their\npower as icons. These famous works no longer\nwork, they just seem decorative. Warhol's 'Marilyn' prints are now seen everywhere, but\nhis 'Ambulance Disaster' still shocks. Crushed\ncar sculptures stand in the centre of the room as\nan echo of destructive consumerism. Cultourists\nlaughed as they watched a mad woman place a plastic fly on Oldenberg's plaster meat display\nbefore photographing it, explaining, \"it's more\nauthentic that way\" to a bemused security guard.\nFor the first time cul tourists can walk over a work of art! Carl Andre placed bricks in the Tate\nGallery, and his floor tiles are here. The\nminimalist room is paradoxically overcrowded,\nreducing the power of these large cubes, boxes\nand shapes. For a better display go to the Tate.\nBeyond this, a two foot square lead cube defies\ngravity, balanced precariously against the wall\nby a pole. A beautiful neon light sculpture leads\nthe way past the two conceptual is t works by\nWeiner Statements painted on the wall. One\nreads: 'To See And Be Seen'.\nAlready drained by this incredible journey\nthrough art, the cul tourists can rest on the bus as\nthey head to the Saatchi Gallery to discover\nAmerica's latest trends...\nChaos! Entropy has struck, the movements\nhave collapsed and art is once more in a state of\nflux. In the Saatchi, the cul tourists are welcomed\nby Nauman's 'Green Light Corridor', a neon lit\npassage, too narrow for people to walk through,\nwhich shows the way into a veritable torture\nchamber of confusion. Huge paintings sprawl\nacross the walls in a multitude of styles,\nsculptures squat on the floor. These modern day\nartists use any methods they can in order to\nmake sense of technology, media and violence.\nIn this melee, various objects stand out.\nBorofsky is obsessed with numbers, his giant\n'Split Head' has 2,673,047 tattooed across its\nbifurcated forehead. Kitsch supremo Jeff Koons\ngives us vacuum cleaners and a glass encapsulated basketball. Robert Gober, whose genital\nwallpaper recently adorned the Serpentine\nGallery, gives us a closet for our sordid desires.\nOvershadowing all this, a giant scrolling\nmessage board delivers cryptic advice, \"... Then\nyou're much less likely to be assaulted ... use\nwhat is dominant in a culture to change it\nquickly ... you have nothing to worry about...\",\nand cul tourists trap themselves in a triangular\nglass room for a sense of closure.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of new art is\nInstallation work, where whole rooms are\ntransformed into psychoactive spaces. James\nTurrell has provided one of his arenas of light,\nunfortunately out of order. Few people return the\nsame after experiencing Viola's 'Room of St.\nJohn'. Providing cul tourists with a latter day\nversion of St John's imprisonment, the room is\ndark with a rumbling soundtrack and shaking\nprojections on the end wall which create an\noverpowering sense of unease and disturbance.\nIn another room, the fourth dimension of time\nrecurs in a video installation. Eight screens\nflicker with seemingly random images and\ncolours. Don't stand at the edge, sit in the\nmiddle where a voice talks insanely from all\nsides. Walking off, the voice droned on with\nfrightening prescience: \"Listen, we can part\ncompany at any time. It's all at your\nconvenience.\"\nSo, as the journey ends, I would advise you\nall to follow in the steps of the cul tourists and\nmake the pilgrimage to the Royal Academy\nwhile you have the chance. It's not for elitists,\nbut deserves to be seen by everybody. Even if\nyou cannot afford the cost of the entire\nexhibition, visit the Saatchi (it's free) for even\nthis small part is an entire show in its own right,\nexciting and weird.\nThe American Art exhibition runs until 12th December\n\n"

Attended and\npresented by over 150 students, the conference\nwill encompass everything from a visionary\nperspective of the future of Europe, looking into\nand beyond current problems, to the shape of\nEurope twenty years into the next century.\nThe conference takes place in Oxford\nUniversity from 19th to 25th March 1994. It\nstarts with a team-building programme on\nSunday. The following three days are spent on\ncommittee work. There will be three major\ncommittees: Political, Economic and Ethnics/\nCulture. The committees will be addressed by\nspeakers of high importance such as MEPs, and\nEuropean Commissioners. At the end of the\ncommittee work each committee will have\nproduced a white paper (its opinion on the\nproblem) which will be presented before the\nPlenary Discussion (the Assembly of all the\ndelegates) and voted on.\nThe following countries have confirmed their\nparticipation: Belgium, Greece, U.K., Ireland,\nPortugal, Denmark, Spain, France, Sweden,\nHolland and Germany.\nAn application for participation is eligible for\nanyone having citizenship of one of the above\ncountries. An application should consist of a letter and CV, a supporting note from your\nacademic tutor or Dean of Faculty and a typed\nessay in English of no more 800 words\ndiscussing your vision of Europe in 2020 with\nreference to one of the following topics, looking\nat the problems from all aspects, especially with\na view to 'Hopes, Traps and Priorities':\n1. Europe Trade Block or free trader?\n2. Regional economic fluctuations within\nEurope: can a single policy cope?\n3. The balance of power between Europe\nand the nation state: dealing with\nconflicts of interest.\n4. Europe and the UN: dealing with\nBosnia's future.\n5. Is there a distinct European identity?\n6. Environmental controls: should the EC impose them on the Third World ?\nThe application material must be addressed\nto Mr Owen Johns, Brasenose College, Oxford\nOX1 and should be received by Friday 10th December 1993. If selected, each delegate has to\npay \u00a3150 for the participation fee\nFor more information please contact either\nMrs Bettina Carr-AUinson, Fontainebleu Youth\nFoundation, 110a Banbury Rd, Oxford, OX26 JU Tel: 0865 311946 or Kyriakos Hatzaras,\nEE2, e mail kh@ee, Tel 071 402 0680\nAs an EY P alumnus, I urge all European\nYouth Parliament Alumni in the College to get\norganised.

Then I heard about the International Association for\nthe Exchange of Students for Technical\nExperience (IAESTE). The scheme offered\npenultimate year undergraduates the opportunity to spend the summer working overseas in\ntheir field of study. There was nothing to lose\nso, at the expense of a second class stamp, I inquired for details.\nI applied and was successful in obtaining a placement in Spain. I was among ten students\nselected from Imperial College, by far the\ngreatest number of students chosen from any\none UK educational establishment. (The\nIAESTE organisation was founded at Imperial\nCollege in 1948.) My fellow Imperial College\ntrainees were off to Croatia, Finland, France,\nHungary, Poland, Sierra Leone and Turkey.\nI was greeted at Madrid airport by a Spanish\nstudent and found that, by, chance I was on the\nsame flight was another IAESTE trainee, Mark\nfrom Scotland. After driving around Madrid in\nthe sweltering heat for an hour, we came to the\nunanimous conclusion that we didn't know\nwhere we were going! Another five hours\npassed negotiating with landlords and viewing\ngro tty accommodation. Eventually the student\ngot fed up and dumped us at a pension (a sort of\ndown market hotel infested with vermin).\nWe survived the first week eating at\nMcDonalds. Mark knew about as much Spanish\nas I know Mongolian but, fortunately, you don't need much lingo to order a Big Mac and Coke.\nAs time went by things started to look a little\nbrighter, though they could only have gone one\nway. Through the IAESTE office in Spain we\nmanaged to get somewhere decent to live. I found myself living with another I A ESTE trainee from Denmark, an Algerian and a Thai.\nOn my first day, it took me two hours to find\nthe office of the engineers with whom I would\nbe working. When I walked through the door\nthey told me that they were not expecting me\nfor another month! Hardly anyone in the office\nspoke English but my supervisor Pedro compensated for that by being quad-lingual.\nAs the weeks shot by, the tempo of the work\npicked up and all credit goes to the staff at\nEsteyco S A for their dedicated attention\ntowards me. The work I was presented with was\nrelevant and I am proud to say that I got away\nwithout touching the broom, photocopier or\ncoffee machine. My design office experience\nculminated in a visit to a construction site in the\nbeautiful backdrop of the Galician countryside.\nMy working week was a minimum of 45\nhours and, unlike most Spaniards, the people in\nthe office seemed immune to the traditional\nafternoon siesta. The money was just sufficient\nto cover all my expenses, the idea being that\nyou don't make a profit.\nOver the weekends, I A ESTE organised\noutings but, after tagging along with them for\none week, I decided my Spanish was strong\nenough to explore Spain on my own initiative. I also ventured outside Madrid, despite the cost\nof travel. The highlights of my visit were\nundoubtedly the visits to the Alhambra Palace\nin Granada and the mosque in Cordoba, echoes\nof the much underrated Islamic past of Spain.\nGoing to a country for a holiday and living\nthere are two different things. I left Spain with a lot more than an T Luv Spain' t shirt.\nEveryone I spoke to had an equally\nenjoyable time and I stress that getting selected\nfor an IAESTE placement is not necessarily a function of your academic prowess. If you're\ninterested then you'd better hurry as the\ndeadline for registration is the 10th December\n1993. Details may be found on the Careers\nService notice board or directly from the\nCentral Bureau.\nMashud Chowdhury (Civ Eng 3)\nThere is an IAESTE presentation on 30th November in room 201, Civ Eng, at 12.15pm For more information on summer jobs, contact the Careers Service\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nArtful Dodging In The Capital\nIn a one man show, Marcus Alexander introduces you to art in London.\nEither you can bow your head, gain a permanent\nslouch, mumble about Laplace Transforms and\nbecome one of thousands of apathetic zombies\nat Imperial College who can't relate to anything\nmore complex than a spanner,\nOr...\nYou can do something about it! London is\nthe cultural capital of the world, where you can\nfind whatever your tastes require, be it high class\ntheatre or Soho peep shows. Go out, venture\nonto the streets and discover it all for yourself.\nVisit a museum (there are three within five\nminutes walk of Imperial College), go to the\ntheatre, involve yourself. After all, no-one else\nwill do it for you. You may have noticed that\nFelix has a lively selection of reviews, ranging\nit from music to art. Yes, art! Why, you may say,\nshould I be interested in that? Quite simply\nbecause it is everywhere and everything. (\"The\nsecret of life is in art\" -O.W.) An interest in art will give you a greater\nunderstanding of anything else, from TV to\nquantum mathematics. Contrary to popular\nbelief, art is not for pretentious arty far ty students with silly hats, but it is for you. So\nwhere can I find it? Well, on this page, I, as\ncultural ambassador to Imperial College, will\nlead you by the hand to the bizarre, the curious,\nthe mind-blowing, whatever it is that's going on\nin the world of the visual. So, here's a brief note\non three of the more well known galleries.\nThe National Gallery\nYou've heard the name, you may even have\nseen it at Trafalgar Square, but have you ever\ndared to look inside? The National Gallery\nhouses the national collection of Western\nEuropean Painting dating from the 13th Century\nright up to the 20th Century, which basically\nmeans that it has just about everything. It would\ntake days to explore the cavernous interiors and\nsee all of the 2,200 paintings, so it's much better\njust to pop in when passing to have a quick look\nat a few specialities. You'll find paintings by\njust about every artist you've heard of, including\nselections by Constable, Turner, Van Gogh and\nPicasso, so there's something for everyone, even\npeople who don't think they are interested in art.\nAlso, you can venture into the Sainsbury\nwing (Prince Charles' favourite 'carbuncle on a much loved friend') where, if you succeed in\navoiding the icons and religious paintings, you\nwill find the Micro Gallery. Especially for\ntechno phil es and couch potatoes, this allows\nyou to wander around a virtual museum without\nwearing out your Doc Marten shoe soles and\nview any picture you want. For a small fee, an\ninstant reproduction is yours to keep, along with\nits background history.\nSo, next time you're passing Trafalgar\nSquare have a look at the National, if only to\nsay that you've been. It is free, so you've got\nnothing to lose.\nNational Gallery. Trafalgar square (Tube:\nCharing Cross/ Leicester Square). Open MonSat 10am6 pm, Sun 2pm6 pm. Free admission.\nSmiling over the Tham\nThe Tate Gallery\nMuch loved by students of all descriptions, the\nTate is best known for it's superb collection of\nmodern art, with many familiar faces, including\nPicasso, Warhol and Matisse. After fighting\nyour way past the tourists, security guards and\nsellers of the new Tate magazine for Culture\nVultures, you are confronted by Rodin's Kiss. A very famous sculpture, but his others are more\ninteresting.\nBeyond that are many other gems. The\nminimalist room contains almost nothing. Here\nyou can form a personal conjunction with the\nexhibits, or just laugh at the 'Load Of Bricks',\notherwise known as 'Equivalent VIII'\n(Apparently there are also seven others in\nexistence). OK, so you could have done it yourself in your back garden but you didn't, did you?\nGiacometti's spindly stick figures are well\nworth seeing, along with Henry Moore's work.\nthe beloved Tate Gallery\n(For a closer Moore, just walk across from\nCollege to Kensington Gardens to see the Arch.)\nWalking beyond 'The Geometry Of Fear', you\ncan find a load of Pollocks. The joke may be\nold, but Jackson Pollock's random splatters of\npaint are still worth seeing.\nAlthough known for such works, the Tate has\nmuch more than that. It has a superb collection\nof earlier British art, mainly from the 18th Century onwards, with works by William Blake\nand others. In the Clore Gallery is the Turner\ncollection, the most comprehensive selection of\nTurner's paintings on display anywhere. They\nalso have regularly changing exhibitions (for\nwhich you have to pay) and for any real\nenthusiasts, there are lectures and talks. So\nspend a Sunday afternoon at the Tate and you'll\nfeel much better for it.\nTate Gallery, Millbank. Tube: Pimlico.\nOpen Mon-Sat 10am5.30 pm, Sun 2pm5.30 pm The Hayward Gallery\nA spider in the midst of the concrete web that is\nthe South Bank Centre, the Hayward Gallery\nhas been adored and spurned with equal venom\nover the years. Certainly it does not compare\nwith the outward majesty of the National or the\nTate yet it has displayed some of the most\ninnovative and abrasive exhibitions over the last\ncouple of years. As there are no standing\nexhibitions, variety is assured throughout the\nyear. Georgia O 'Keefe, the art of the Incas and\nAborigines, Magritte's surreal visions and\nJames Turrell's light installations have been\namongst the wonders seen at the Hayward.\nMaybe its time to bloom is just arriving.\nThe Hayward is presently showing the\nspirited work of Roger Hilton and installations\nfrom Julian Opie.\nHayward Gallery, South Bank Centre Tube:\nEmbankment or Waterloo. Open daily 10am6 pm, Tue & Wed until 8pm. Concessions \u00a33.50\nDon't forget about the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens\n\n"

    "content": "14 Feature\nWorld Aids Day - Time To Act\nNothing to do with you, right? Wrong, says Nicky Fox, ICU Welfare Officer.\n1. Do you accept that the spread of HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, is\npreventable?\n2. Since there is, as yet, no vaccine and no cure for HIV and AIDS, do you\nagree that efforts to prevent the spread of the virus are of para-mount\nimportance?\n3. Do you agree that the cost of AIDS to society in terms of lives lost and\nmoney spent could be reduced by preventative work?\n4. Do you agree that every individual has a responsibility to support efforts\nto halt the spread of preventable illnesses like HIV?\n5. Do you agree that you are unlikely to know the HIV status of every\nperson you sleep with, especially since many people are un-aware that\nthey have HIV and, therefore, the only way you can be certain that you\nare not putting yourself or others at risk is to take responsibility for\nyourself and not give that responsibility to somebody else?\n6. Do you agree that individuals have the right to be informed about the\nrisks of particular practices, so that they may make reasoned choices\nabout their behaviour?\n7. Do you agree that society has a responsibility to provide information to\nenable individuals to make informed choices about their lives?\n8. Do you agree that people who are ill should have the right to and access\nto appropriate treatment, care and support?\n9. Do you therefore agree that AIDS is a social problem for us all?\n(Adapted from the National AIDS Trust's WAD Resource Pack)\nSo What Is World AIDS Day All About?\nIf you have just read through the previous series\nof questions and thought about your own\npersonal responses to them, whether they be\npositive or negative, World AIDS Day at\nImperial has been worthwhile. Why? The\nanswer lies at the heart of the objective of World\nAIDS Day - a day of action designed to encourage us, at the very least, to think about HIV and\nAIDS. At the most, World AIDS Day gives us all\nan opportunity to act.\nAIDS - Time to Act\nThis is the theme set by the World Health\nOrganisation for World AIDS Day 1993. The\nwords 'Time To Act' were chosen to stress the\nurgency of the situation that we now face as a global society. You may notice posters around\nCollege displaying this message and an image of\na breaking chain. The visual message is: It's time to act to break the chain of infection and to\nbreak the chains of oppression and\ndiscrimination.\nSome of you reading this article may be\nunconvinced of the urgency and the need for us\nto act now, but perhaps you could reflect on the\nfollowing: Every country is affected by HIV and\nAIDS and, in the UK alone (as of July '93), at\nleast 20,035 people were known to be living\nwith HIV. 7,699 of these people had developed\nAIDS, of whom 4,794 had already died. There\nare many more people infected who are not\nknown about and who may not even know\nthemselves.\nTens of thousands of people are already\nworking worldwide fo slow the spread of HIV\nand to provide care and support to those\ninfected. These facts are not provided to induce\nfear, but rather to inform and encourage the\nrealisation that now is the time to act!\nAction can take many forms and may be\nprivate or public. Whatever action we each\nchoose to take this World AIDS Day, the day\nprovides us all with an opportunity to act against\nignorance and to learn; to act against the complacency and denial that says AIDS is not my\nproblem; to recognise that we can exercise\nchoice to reduce our risks of contracting HIV\nand of passing it on to others, by practising\n'safer sex'; to questions others' and our own\ndiscriminatory attitudes and behaviours to those\nliving with HIV and AIDS and to become more\nsensitive and aware that those around us -colleagues, friends, family - may be living\nprivate lives affected by HIV and AIDS.\nThe Red Ribbon\nOne small way we can take action this World\nAIDS Day, is to wear a red ribbon, the international symbol of AIDS Awareness. Through\nthis, we make a publicly visible statement, of\ncare, concern, hope and support in the fight\nagainst AIDS. The red ribbon symbolises care\nand concern about HIV and AIDS and those\naffected by it, hope that one day the epidemic\nwill be over and support for those living with\nHIV, for the preventative efforts to halt the\nspread of the virus and for the efforts to produce\neffective and accessible treatments, services,\nvaccines and cures.\nOn World AIDS Day we hope to make these\nribbons available to you, at the information stalls\nin the Student Union, in the Junior Common\nRoom (JCR) during the daytime, and at the\nWorld AIDS Day benefit disco in the Union,\nduring the evening.\nThe Union is organising several events for\nWorld AIDS Day next Wednesday.\nAt lunchtime there will be stalls in the Union\nfoyer, JCR and at St Mary's providing information on HIV and AIDS and also free condoms.\nA benefit gig, organised by Ents, is to be held\nin the Union Building in the evening. The entry\nfee of only 50p will go to the Terrence Higgins\nTrust together with the proceeds from a barrel of\nbeer kindly donated by the Union Bar.\nAs mentioned in the above article, the red\nribbon is the international symbol of AIDS\nawareness.\nPlease take part in World AIDS Day, wear\nyour red ribbon and help us to promote AIDS\nawareness around College.\nImperial College Union World AIDS Day is\norganised by:\nPaul Collens\nNicky Fox\nMin Kavlak\nIf you are concerned and want to talk about\nHIV and AIDS, anxious about your HIV status, considering having an HIV antibody\ntest or want information and advice on HIV\nand AIDS, these contacts can will assist you:\n\u2022National Aids Helpline: 0800 567123.

However, in hardly any of\nthese are the heroes black (a surprise seeing as\n33% of all cowboys were black) and this is what\nMario Van Peebles sets out to rectify in Posse.\nIt is about the legend of gunslinger Jessie\nLee (Van Peebles) and his Posse. While the\nposse are on the run from a tyrannical Colonel,\nJessie is seeking to avenge his father's death.\nThe film has a strong plot with many sub-plots, good character is at ions and it raises points\nto make you think. However, when you have the\nbest elements in a film, it can raise the stakes\ntoo high and when Posse doesn't make it you're\nleft screaming \"Why didn't they just make it\nthat bit better...then it would have been great\".\nThis, I would suggest, is largely due to the\ndirection of Van Peebles. Situations are often\nunclear and action scenes lack the edge which\nmakes them amazing. He lacks the subtlety of\nmaking you care about the characters, so when\nthey die it just happens rather than being a shock.\nThe cinematography has some incredible\nshots but that's all they are, a couple of seconds\nof something that could have been. It often\nlooks more like a twenty second photography\nexhibition which is disappointing.\nThe pace is good and holds your attention,\nbut it does this by jumping from one scene to\nthe next instead of flowing. Van Peebles seemed\nto be aiming for a cross between the modern\nwestern and the stylish, but often surreal aspects\nof spaghetti westerns. Rather than try to blend\nthese he seems to have opted for a pick 'n' mix\napproach so the film never really gels properly.\nA crying shame for an almost great movie.\nMagellan\niii is ii it iii l^B \u2022\nStarring: Chris Rock, Allen Payne and Charlie\nMurphy (Eddie's brother)\nDirector: Nelson George\nCB4 is a revelation; finally someone has had the\ncourage to s at i rise the macho posturing of\ngangsta rappers and the wit to know how to do it\nproperly. This film, from music video director\nTamra Davis, also manages to include some\nvery good examples of the genre in question,\nthough with titles like 'Sweat Of My Balls' there\nis no question of the message being compromised.\nThe plot is a relatively simple one. Three\nmiddle-class black kids have aspirations to\nbecome rap stars. They have the talent, but can't seem to find an image, until they come into\ncontact with local drug dealer and all round bad\negg, Gusto. His imprisonment conveniently\ngives w impish Albert the opportunity to assume\nthe hard man persona and remodel the group.\nThey become the most popular band in the\nworld (as you do) and everybody is happy. Then\nGusto escapes from jail. Suffice to say that there\nis a suitably happy ending. The portrayal of the\nband, their rise to fame,the scandal, the inevitable break-up and the even more inevitable\nreunion concert.\nOne very nice touch is the inclusion of a geeky documentary crew who provide us with\nthe early testimonials from rap legends such as\nIce-T and Flavor-Flav. They also lend a surreal\nfeel to the proceedings. This film is highly\nenjoyable, both for the rap connoisseur and the\nnovice. Ignore any comparisons with the overrated 'This Is Spinal Tap', CB4 is the real thing.\nTony\nBodysnatchers\nDirector: Abel Ferarra\nBrilliant. Ferarra's incarnation of the popular\nbody snatchers myth is less a remake than an\ninspired overhaul. Setting the film in a military\ncamp gives degrees of tension to the settings that\nmake the backdrop compelling in its own right\nand, like Cameron's Aliens, gets the pulse\nrunning from the very start.\nUnlike his precursors, Ferarra never shows\nthe aliens arrive, but somehow transmits a sense\nof their presence to the audience who, for the\nmost part know the eventual outcome - a knowledge which makes the foreboding stronger\nstill. And when the aliens' presence is finally\novert, the audience can only watch helplessly as\nthe humans' impotence against the hordes is\ndemonstrated: \"Where you gonna go; where you\ngonna hide...There's no- one else like you any\nmore,\" a scientists 'wife' gloats.\nYet, while sustaining enough fear and unease\nto satisfy most horror fans, one is constantly\naware of the stunning beauty of Henry Links'\nphotography, each shot so carefully crafted as to\nembody the best of Ridley Scott (Bladerunner)\nand Copolla (Apocalypse Now) - incredible\nmontages of light and sound; silhouetted torch\nchases through misty woods and in one\nparticular Aliens-esque sequence, dimly-lit\nsoldiers lifting alien pods out from a misty river.\nThe film is brilliant, far, far superior to\nJurassic Park and probably on a par with Aliens\nand Terminator 2.1 share fully the anguish of the\nScreen International rep who complained bitterly\nabout Warner's decision to release straight to\nvideo without a cinema release - they are insane.\nNot only is it a very good film, but it is a very\ncinematic film, the cinema scope format having\nbeen used to excellent effect (and incredible\nsound), TV can only strangle its greatness.\nThe Pear\nComing soon to a reviews page near you: Addams Family Va\n\n"

Stocks are currently dangerously low and\npeople are desperately needed to donate. If, like\nme, you've been wanting to give blood, but\nhaven't managed to get round to it yet, there is\nan opportunity to give an armful today in\nSouthside Gym. The first session starts at\n9.45am with the latest arrival time being\n11.15am. The second session is from 2.15pm to\n4pm. If you haven't donated before, then don't worry, it's almost painless and you even get a drink and bicci es afterwards!\nTribute\nIn last Friday's edition of the Evening Standard\nthere was an article about a planned memorial to\nFreddie Mercury. Apparently, this is to be\nerected in the 'main courtyard of Imperial\nCollege'. Now, the only courtyard-type area I can think of is Beit Quad. Does this mean that\nwe can expect a bronze statue of this pop idol to\nbe gracing the front of the Union Building? I personally think it would look a bit out of place.\nThey'd be better off putting a concrete slab in\nthe ground or a plaque on the wall. We could\neven have a sign saying 'Freddie Played Here'.\nAnd why have they chosen Imperial College for\nit? Apparently to stop the fans turning into a shrine. So, instead Freddie will probably end up\nwith a traffic cone on his head and a collection\nof skiffs around the base.\nRed Ribbons\nNext Wednesday is World AIDS Day and there\nis an article on page 17 of this week's Felix\nabout it. The Union are asking you to pick up\nand wear one of the red ribbons which\nsymbolise AIDS awareness. They will be\navailable from the JCR and the Union Building\non the day. World AIDS Day isn't another\ncampaign begging for donations. Instead, it\nwants you to think about HIV and AIDS and to\nknow the risks and precautions you can take.\nAdvanced Warning\nThe last issue of Felix this term (out on the last\nday of term) will be a Christmas Special. If you\nhave any articles with a Christmassy feel to\nthem, can you get them in as soon as possible\nand at the latest by Wednesday 18th December.\nThe format may be slightly different, with the\nissue being split into two parts, one containing\nthe news, clubs articles and reviews and the\nother being a Christmas supplement.

First presented at the Royal\nCourt in 1979, this play has been repeated in\nover 40 countries, courtesy of the powerful\nportrayal of the struggle for survival of Jewish\nintegrity comprehended by the eternal Jewish\nintellectual who advocates the holocaust of Jews\nbut omits the holocaust of political prisoners,\ncriminals and, lastly, the butt of Nazi hate - not\nthe Jews but the gays!\nThis is a landmark play as well as a classic in\nits own right, depicting the harrowing story of\n'queer' or 'fluff love amid Nazi persecution in\nconcentration camps, which demonstrates that\ngays, not Jews, witnessed the worst persecution.\nWolf, a tall blonde superman played by\nRichard Trice, is shot by the Nazi's for being\n'queer'. He was 'picked up' by Max (Nick\nMercer) who lives with his effeminate lover\nRudy (Andrew Ableson) and all homosexuals\nflee the cities in fear of reprisals.\nLiving in a tent outside Berlin, Max and\nRudy pretend not to be 'queer' while Uncle\nFreddie (John O 'Byrne) tries to arrange passage\nfor them to Amsterdam. Both are arrested for\n'touching' and end up in Dachau. Max denies\neven knowing Rudy who is shot for his effeminacy. Max is rewarded for his 'straightness' by\nbeing given a yellow star instead of the pink\ntriangle and enjoys certain privileges and\nluxuries only allowed to Jews.\nMax meets Horst, impressively played by\nAidan Slater, who has been imprisoned for\nsigning a petition calling for more homosexual\nrecognition. The end result is a struggle for\nidentity which the Nazi Corporal and the captain\nattempt to rub out using the terror tactics of cruel\ndiscipline.\nWorth seeing even if you're not gay, but\ndon't expect a happy evening out. This is a play\nfor the unceremoniously uns que emi sh who have\nsome interest in the subject matter.\nAdrian Thurston\nEtcetera Theatre, Oxford Arms, 265 Camden\nHigh Street, NW1. 071 482 4857.

Ends 28th November.\nWhmmM\nThe Winter's Tale Relative Values\nWhen an actor stars in a long-running television\nseries, particularly a cop show, there is a tendency to assume that the screen role represents the full extent of his acting abilities. To\nmake such an assumption of John 'Bergerac'\nNettles, would be to make a very silly mistake\nindeed, for this production of The Winter's Tale\nshows him to be a Shakespearean actor of the\nfirst order.\nThe sheer intensity of his character is ation of\nthe jealousy-stricken King of Sicily creates an\naura permeating into every nook and cranny of\nthe auditorium. When Nettles' tortured monarch\nexits the stage, the aura fades, leaving a vacuum\nthat could, in any other company, flatten the\nproduction.\nFortunately, this is the RSC, where the\nsupporting players match their leads measure for\nmeasure. This is most evident in the 'bit' parts,\nsuch as those of Geoffrey Dench and Graham\nTurner. Their old and young Shepherd double\nact is at times so hilarious that, if this were\ntelevision and not the stage, they would\nundoubtedly be given their own series.\nSamantha Bond's Hermione, Queen of Sicily\nand cause of all the trouble, was another\nhighlight of the evening, as was Richard\nMcCabe's stupendous playing of Autolycus as a combination of Arthur Daley and Fagin.\nSet such high quality players against\nAnthony Ward's clever minimalist set that\nseamless ly changes from one scene to the next\nand then direct them by the RSC's Adrian Noble\nand one has the recipe for a magic night at the\ntheatre.\nIncidentally, for student on a budget, the\nBarbican offers cheap standbys at \u00a36.50 and \u00a38.\nHowever, my late arrival led me to discover an\ninteresting variant on the try-before-you-buy\nidea. In order to prevent latecomers disrupting\nthe performance, the management keeps them\nwaiting in the bar where, with a comforting\ndrink (\u00a31.80 for a glass of house plo nk), one can\nwatch the first forty-five or so minutes of the\nplay on a monitor. Now, call me a skinflint if\nyou like, but isn't this an absolutely brilliant\nway of finding out if the Shakespeare on offer is\nas you like it?\nSo what is The Winter's Tale about? Does it\nmatter? No-one goes to see Shakespeare for the\nplot, just the quality of the production and this\nis one of the best of them all.\nShaun Joynson\nRSC Barbican, Barbican, EC2. 071 638 8891.\nTube: Moorgate/Barbican. Standby \u00a36.50/\u00a38\n(immediately before performance).\nThis is playing at the recently rebuilt Savoy\nTheatre which was reduced to ruins in a devastating fire in 1990. Painstakingly renovated at a vast cost to its 1920s splendour, it is\nperfect for Noel Coward's play set in the height\nof Bertie Wooster's days with all the upstairs-downstairs shenanigans we love to hate.\nSusan Hampshire plays the Countess whose\nson is about to join the lower ranks by marrying\na Hollywood starlet (played by 'the blond girl in\nthe Philadelphia ads') causing much muttering\nand dismay among the household staff. The\npersonal maid tearfully begs to leave her\nladyship but her ladyship will not have it as she\nhas been a servile companion all her life. The\nplot thickens and a bizarre plan is tailored to\nkeep the maid within the household.\nDespite a stilted start, the true comedy of\nCoward's play emerges in the second half.\nUnfortunately, this comedy, having been played\nout in innumerable productions before, is dull in\nthe extreme. If you want to see the superb Savoy\nTheatre then get a back stage tour, but the idea\nof lunching at the next-door Savoy Grill holds a lot more appeal for me!\nMJ Savoy Theatre, Strand, WC2. 071 836 8888.\nTube: Charing Cross.

In\nwhat has been seen by some\nobservers as an Anti-National\nUnion of Students (NUS) bill, the\nEducation Bill, published this\nWednesday, introduces a 'core' and\n'non-core' funding structure.\nIt demands that campus unions\nballot members annually over\naffiliation to the NUS. John Patten,\nEducation Secretary, in a statement\nsaid, 'the Government has already\nabolished the closed shop in the\nTrade Union sector. Now we want\nto give students the power to\nchoose for themselves what collective involvement they want'.\nLorna Fitzsimons, President of\nthe NUS, denounced the bill as\nlacking 'all detail and fact, but will\ngive power to the Secretary of State\nto decide upon whatever\nregulations he deems fit'.\nWhat classifies as being 'core'\nfunded has been left unclear. The\nbill states that public money may\nonly be used for services 'specified\nby regulations made by the Secretary of State'. Ms Fitzsimons,\naccusing John Patten of ignoring\nthe results of his 'consultation exercise' said, \"It must be made clear to\nParliament, to the public and to\nstudents, exactly what this Bill will\nentail - which student union\nactivities will be publicly funded\nand which will be funded by the\nindividual student.\"\nHowever, Government sources\nhave said that segregating 'core'\nfrom 'non-core' services in an\nexecutive decision rather than a parliamentary bill will allow for\nmore discretion and may permit\nsocial societies, for example, to be\ndirectly funded as core bodies.\nThose non-political societies not\nclassified as core may still retain\nuniversity and Government\nfunding, say insiders.\nAndrew Wensley, President of\nImperial College Union, said, \"The\nminister seems to have ignored the\nmajority of comments put to him,\nby student unions, academics and\nuniversities during five-months of\nconsultation.\"\nThe bill, introduced in the\nHouse of Lords is being spearheaded by Education Minister,\nBaroness Blatch.

(Ans = 1-2%).
