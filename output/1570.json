It appears that the cause could\nbe partially linked to their domestic\ncousin, the honeybee.\nProfessor Mark Brown and his team\nfrom Royal Holloway, University of\nLondon have identified two separate\ndiseases that have potentially \u2018spilled\nover\u2019 from honeybees into bumblebee\npopulations.\nDeformed wing virus (DWV) \u2013 a\nfungal infection which has previously\nbeen shown to significantly shorten\nthe lifespan of honeybees \u2013 is now\npresenting itself among bumblebees. It\nis thought the disease passes back and\nforth between the two species when a\nbumblebee enters a plant previously\nvisited by an infected honeybee.\nAssessing 26 sites across the UK, the\nteam were able to build on previous\nlevels of knowledge and determine an\nidea of national numbers rather than\njust local ones. However, co-author\nDr. Matthias F\u00fcrst warns that this\nresearch is not definitive proof that\nthe disease is passed from honeybees\nto bumblebees rather than vice versa.\nTheir suspicions only span from the\nfact the disease is more prevalent in\nhoneybees.\nDWV has been shown to\nsignificantly shorten the lifespan of\nhoneybees and according to Prof.\nBrown this will \u201cimpact massively on\ntheir ability to go out to collect food\nand look after other bees.\u201d The effects\nof DWV were present in 11% of the\nbumblebees surveyed.\nNot only will this have a noticeable\neffect on bee populations worldwide,\nbut the knock on effects will have\nconsiderable impact on our lives\ntoo. Bumblebees are responsible\nfor pollinating ~70% of the world\u2019s\nflowering plants each year and\naccording to the Guardian, in the\nUS alone bumblebees provide $3bn\n(\u00a31.8bn) worth of crop pollination\nannually. Preventing the further\nspread of this disease is therefore of\nextreme importance.\nDon\u2019t panic too much though, as Dr\nDavid Aston \u2013 president of the British\nBeekeepers Association (BBKA) \u2013 has\nstated that the key to prevention of\nmost diseases in bees lies with good\nhusbandry skills. The onus therefore\nD\niagnosis and treatment\nof cancer often involves\nsome of the most\ndamaging procedures\nthat doctors would ever\nintentionally inflict upon a human\nbody. The effects of chemotherapy,\nfor instance, are notorious, but\nradiation from treatment or scans\ncan sometimes be just as harmful to\na patient\u2019s health. A study published\nin the Lancet this week proposes a\nnew technique that could completely\neliminate the radiation dose from\nscans used to investigate tumours.\nIt could well improve outcomes for\nmany vulnerable patients, and even\nsave lives.\nWhen determining the best\ntreatment options, doctors need\ndetailed information on a tumour\u2019s\nsize and location, and whether it has\nspread to any other parts of the body.\nA common way to find this out is with\na PET-CT scan. This type of imaging\ninvolves injecting a radioactive drug\ninto a patient which highlights tissues\nthat are more active than normal,\nsuggesting the presence of a tumour.\nAt the same time, a normal CT scan\nis performed to analyse the sites that\nhave been highlighted.\nA single PET-CT scan can give a\nradiation dose equivalent to more\nthan 700 chest X-rays \u2013 about 4-6\ntimes the background dose an average\nperson would experience over a whole\nyear. While these levels are unlikely\nto cause any serious long-term effects\nin adults, they could potentially be\nextremely harmful to the sensitive\ntissues of a child.\nA much more attractive option\nwould be MRI. It has been widely\nused in medicine for many years,\nand involves imaging tissues using\nradio waves in a powerful magnetic\nfield \u2013 without the need for harmful\nradiation. Unfortunately, despite its\nmany uses, on its own it is unable to\ndistinguish between cancerous and\nhealthy tissues, and so has not been\nwidely used in this type of cancer\ndiagnostics.\nThe new research from scientists\nat Stanford University has found a\nway around this problem. The team\nused a common iron supplement as a\ncontrast agent to highlight tumours, as\nthey found that it only gets absorbed\nby healthy tissues, and shows up\nclearly on the MRI. And unlike other\ncontrast agents that have previously\nbeen tested, this drug stays in the body\nlong enough for detailed images to be\nlies with all those of you in Shoreditch\nwith your roof top beehives or the\nfloppy haired masses pumping out\nartisanal honey at farmers markets of\nSussex.\nAs always, prevention is better than\ncure.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature12977\nThis stock image makes PET-CT scans look much more pleasant than I imagine they actually are\nTed Roger Karson\nproduced by the scanner.\nNot only does this technique\nachieve the same results as the PETCT scan but without the radiation\ndose, it also uses scanners already\ncommon in hospitals, and a well\ntested, freely available drug. If\nfurther investigation confirmed the\ntechnique\u2019s effectiveness, it could be\nrolled out relatively easily in many\nhospitals around the world.\nge healthcare\n\n"

Whilst this\ndoes vary depending on weather\nconditions as well as other factors,\nwind is already the key leader by some\nstretch in reaching our UK generation\ntarget of 15% from renewables by\n2020. To safeguard this it\u2019s essential\nthat many of the wind farms built in\nthe mid-1990s attract the investment\nrequired for refinancing.\nEarly studies conducted by critics\nof wind farms previously claimed\nelectricity generation from them\nwould fall by a third after just a decade\nof operational use, potentially making\nthem economically unviable. A new\nand comprehensive study conducted\nby Imperial College Business School\nshows this is far from the truth.\nImperial researchers assessed the\nUK\u2019s fleet of all 4,246 wind turbines\nacross all 531 wind farms and found\nthat even the earliest of them built in\nthe early 1990s were operating at three\nquarters of their original output after\nalmost 20 years of operation and thus\nare now easily expected to last their\nfull predicted lifespan of 25 years.\nDr Iain Staffell, co-author of the\npaper and researcher at Imperial\nCollege stated that \u201cOur study\nprovides some certainty, helping\ninvestors to see that wind farms are\nan effective long-term investment\nand a viable way to help the UK tackle\nfuture energy challenges.\u201d It was also\nmentioned that with the improved\ndesign of turbines built today and\nthe huge improvements seen over\nthe last two decades in the operation\nand maintenance of the technology,\nwind farms are actually becoming\nincreasingly attractive investment\npropositions, banishing the fears one\nheld on their long term viability.\nA\nfresh new enquiry\nhas been ordered by\nNHS England medical\ndirector Professor Sir\nBruce Keogh following\nthe care of ten children who died or\nwere left seriously injured following\ncardiac surgery at Bristol Royal\nHospital for Children. Professor\nKeogh met with the families of the\nchildren last Friday where he heard\nstories depicting a \u201ccatalogue of\nneglect and poor care\u201d.\nSir Ian Kennedy, who led the famous\nBristol heart inquiry in the 90s, will\nagain be chairing the investigation. It\nis likely that they will again conclude\nthat the paediatric cardiac services\nat Bristol are \u201csimply not up to\ntask\u201d. The 90\u2019s inquiry discovered\nshortages of key surgeons and nurses,\na lack of leadership, accountability,\nand teamwork, which is frankly\nunacceptable in this day and age.\nHarley Pascoe, who was born with\nhalf a heart, was transferred to Bristol\nfour days after his birth to have a tube\ninserted to improve his blood flow.\nHis operation, however, was cancelled\nfive times in one week because he was\n\u201cnot sick enough\u201d, and he died whilst\nwaiting.\nSirKennedy,alongwithparentsofthe\naffected children will independently\nreview each case in the forthcoming\nmonths and will hopefully get to the\nbottom of this tragedy.\nW\nith 33 medals\nand 13 Golds the\nSochi Olympics\nwas a resounding\nsuccess for\nRussia\u2019s athletes; they topped the\ntable and according to Putin, restored\nnational sporting pride. The $51 billion\nvanity project all came together, and\neven the rain couldn\u2019t dampen the\nparty.\nHowever, in addition to the well-publicised homophobic measures\nand the senseless cruelty to animals\nin build up to the games, there was a\nsilent evil lurking by the black sea; the\nsustainability legacy.\nLike Vancouver and London before\nit, the Games set out to be the first\never carbon neutral event, but just\nlike Eddy the Eagle in \u201988, they fell\nwell short. But it\u2019s not all bad. The\nambitious plan to plant five saplings\nfor every tree felled was implemented,\nfish stocks have been replenished,\neco-friendly sewage and energy\nworks have received investment.\nThe organisers even went some way\ntowards offsetting some of the 160,000\ntonnes of carbon dioxide emissions\nresulting indirectly from the event.\nThe environmental legacy of the\nevent is, on balance, a disaster.\nConstruction near the Caucasus\nBiosphere Reserve (UNESCO heritage\nsite) had devastating impacts, and the\nstate rail operator dumped waste in\nthe Mzymta River Valley. Villages like\nAshtyr, overlooking nearby Sochi,\nhave been left in ruin with open\nquarries, polluted water resources\nand high speed rail links going within\nmetres of their homes.\nSo after banning the gays and\nexterminating the strays it seems that\nRussia shan\u2019t change its polluting\nways.\nE\nver felt insecure about your\nstubbly legs or unbleached\n\u2018tache? Well then you will\nno doubt be impressed by\nthe bravery of Harnaam\nKaur \u2013 the 23 year old lady who has\nbeen keeping a full beard for almost\nseven years. At the age of eleven, she\nwas embarrassed to discover that she\nhad excessive hair growth on her face,\nwhich then spread to her chest, arms\nand the rest of her body.\nThis is because she suffers from\na condition called polycystic ovary\nsyndrome (PCOS), which is estimated\nto affect one in five women in the\nUK, though over 50% of people are\nsymptomless.\nSchool became unbearable as she\nbecame the subject of vicious and\ncruel bullying which led her to isolate\nherself in her house and later suffered\nfrom suicidal thoughts. However,\nwhen she was 16 she was baptised\nas a Sikh. In the Sikh faith, followers\nare encouraged to keep their hair\nto embrace the perfection of God\u2019s\ncreation.\nAbout a month after her conversion,\nshe decided to embrace her hair and\nvowed never to return to the endless\nwaxing, bleaching and shaving she\nresorted to in her teens. She claims\nnow that she has never felt more\nfeminine or sexy and is sharing her\nstory on YouTube in order to help\nother women gain self-confidence.\nCertainly, I feel inspired and think this\nis a thought-provoking example of the\nimportance of having the confidence\nto do whatever makes YOU feel\nbeautiful, regardless of what others\nmay think.\nLawrence D\u2019Silva\nEnvironment & Health Editor\nWind Farms have a brighter, longer\nfuture thanks to Imperial research\nNEWS OPINIONS\nNadiah Fernandes\nContributor\nA Sochi-summary:\nHomophobia?

Send submissions to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk to showcase\nyour work in Felix.\nMore Than A Taste\nA\nTaste of Honey is a\nplay as predictable, yet\nironic as its title would\nsuggest.\nLet me explain\nmore. Helen is a whinging single\nmother more interested in keeping\nher hair fixed in place than feeding\nher whinging teenage daughter. She\nabandons her child for her alcoholic\nfianc\u00e9, 10 years her junior. A black\nsailor gets his way with young,\ninnocent Jo and also abandons her,\npregnant. She befriends a gay art\nschool student who uses his bursary\nto look after her while she is too\nashamed to leave the house and work.\nThe alcoholic runs off with another\nwoman and Helen comes back to the\nsquat she left her daughter in.\nThe plot really is as simple as it\nsounds \u2013 like any television soap I\nwould have turned off by now, was a\nthought that flitted through my mind\nevery five minutes.\nHowever, this does not mean that\nA Taste of Honey is a bad play. It\nwas written by 20 year old Shelagh\nDelaney in 1958; a working class\nyoung lady from Salford. She had had\nno formal training in play-writing and\nhad only left school three years prior.\nBeing such a forward-thinking first\nplay, it was no surprise that it was such\na success in the then male-dominated\nworld of theatre. Delaney truly was\nBritain\u2019s first working class female\nplaywright.\nHer background is reflected in her\nwriting. There is no pretension or\nfantasy when portraying working-class Salford, and the comedy is down\nto earth and abrupt, if a little 50s\nslapstick.\nDespite being a superficially simple\nplay, the heavy relationships between\ncharacters required some sturdy\nacting too. This came in the form\nof Lesley Sharp as Helen, and Kate\nO\u2019Flynn who played an excellently\nannoying and throttle-able Jo.\nAsalways,productionattheNational\nTheatre lived up to the excellent\nexpected standards. The direction\n(Bijan Sheibani) prevented the piece\nbecoming tedious despite only having\ntwo settings. The choreography (Aline\nDavid) and music (Paul Englishby)\nalso added to the endearing 50s vibe,\ntopping off the whole piece.\nAlthough it may leave the audience\nwith mixed feelings, especially\nyounger viewers who have grown\nup with hard, fast action and intense\nemotional turmoil of modern\ntelevision, films, and plays; it is a\npiece which is excellently brought to\nlife, even if a little underwhelming for\nmodern times.\nWhat: Richard Deacon\nWhere: Tate Britain, SW1\nWhen: Until 27th April\nPrice: \u00a310, \u00a38.60 students\nI\nn its current headline exhibition,\nTate Britain is looking back on the\nlife of sculptor Richard Deacon, a\nkeystone in the British art scene\nover the past thirty-five years.\nAlthough not as well known as\nfellow sculptors Anish Kapoor and\nAnthony Gormley, Deacon is no less\nimpressive. Gaining recognition in the\nearly 1980\u2019s as part of the Young British\nSculptors movement, he cemented his\nposition at the top of his field after\nbeing awarded the Turner Prize in\n1987 and has continued advancing his\nstyle ever since.\nThis exhibition explores his artistic\nevolution in a well considered and\nbeautifully displayed showcase that\nspans his whole career, from his\nearliest creations to pieces like Fold,\nwhich makes its first ever public\nappearance this month.\nPoetry and philosophy form an\nimportant source of inspiration for\nDeacon, and sonnets by Austrian\npoet Rilke inspire the elegant set of\nsketches that greet you as you enter\nthe exhibition space. A complex\nlayering of graphite and pastel, It\u2019s\nOrpheus When There\u2019s Singing feels\nsimultaneously mathematical and\norganic: an engineer\u2019s blueprints with\nits precise network of construction\nlines overlaid with a form as fluid and\nrhythmic as Orpheus\u2019 sonorous lyre.\nIt is in his exploration of\ncontradictions like this that makes\nDeacon so exciting. Geometric is\nmade organic; heavy seems light; a\nvoid is somehow given mass. In Out\nof Order, he manipulates wood into\nunimaginable shapes. Corkscrews of\nsteamed oak curl in a way more akin to\nwire; lyrical, as if defying gravity.\nOnly Deacon would be able to\nachieve this. Throughout his career\nhe has experimented with a wide\nrange of materials, developing an\nexceptional understanding of their\ncharacter and qualities. He describes\nhimself as a fabricator and the process\nof production is important for him.\nGlue oozes out from the layers of\nlaminated timber. Welds, rivets and\nscrews \u2013 all clear to see \u2013 add to this\nsense of process, giving each piece its\nindividuality.\nIn his abstract forms, Deacon\ndoes not provide you with an ideal\nperspective from which to enjoy the\npiece. In fact there are an infinite\nnumber of points of view from which\nyou can observe it; each unique, no\none better than another. This equality\nin experience encourages you to\nwalk around a work, scrutinise it and\ninteract with it. This was especially the\ncase with Out of Order where there\nwas nothing I wanted to do more than\ngo inside the piece and explore it from\na completely different perspective.\nAfter is another work that really\nstood out for me: a serpentine lattice\nof wood writhing across the floor, only\nto be tamed by the leash of glistening\nsteel that bisects its body. In no other\npiece is the relationship between space\nand volume so masterfully explored.\nThe curving ribs define a void that\nis given the illusion of mass, making\nthe thrashing creature even more\nformidable and powerful. And so,\nwhen the rigid metal band tethers this\nraw energy to the floor, the tension\ncreated is almost unbearable. The\nsweeping form contrasted with a\nstrong dividing line harks back to the\ndrawings from earlier on but now in\n3D, diving through space in the same\ndynamic fashion as one sees in much\nof Deacon\u2019s work.\nThe only pieces I didn\u2019t particularly\nconnect with were from his Art for\nOther People series, a collection of\nsmaller pieces designed for display in\nprivate residences. His works are so\nmuch about space and form that on a\nsmallscale,youjustdon\u2019trelatetothem\nin the same way. They feel static and\nlack the overwhelming effect of some\nlarger pieces like After, which steals the\nshow for me. This Tate retrospective\nis well worth a visit; an excellent\nselection of works carefully chosen to\nhighlight Deacon\u2019s phenomenal skill\nand mastery of material, revealing why\nhe is seen as one of Britain\u2019s foremost\ninnovators in sculpture.\nThe Fluid Fantastic\nWhat: A Taste of Honey\nWhere: National Theatre, SE1\nWhen: Until 11th May\nPrice: Various\nKamil McClelland admires the poetic, mathematical,\norganic forms of sculptor Richard Deacon\n\u00a9 RICHARD DEACON\nRichard Deacon, Lock, 1990\n\n"

As with a lot\nof supporting bands, I had only heard\na handful of their songs. However,\nthey performed them like they were a\nleading act, causing mosh pits rarely\nfound during a supporting act. The\naudience sang along to nearly all of\ntheir songs, such as Aberdeen and\nShake Me Down. They could have\neasily been a headlining act and I can\u2019t\nwait to see them again, whenever that\nmay occur. This is a band who are\nwell-deserving of their co-headlining\ntour in America with Foals in May.\nOf course, it was all about Foals.\nHaving masterfully headlined their\nfirst major UK festival, Latitude, in\nthe summer, they were ready for the\nfirst of their two sold-out nights,\non February 14th, at the legendary\nAlexandra Palace. Prelude, from their\ntheir latest album Holy Fire, is a great\nFoals show their thoroughbred lineage\nAMS album of the week\nMetronomy have had a surprisingly long\njourney to their current position. Started\nby Joseph Mount all the way back in 1999,\nit took until 2006 for the first album, fully\ninstrumental Pip Paine (Pay the \u00a35000\nYou Owe), to be released. 2008 saw the\nfirst recognisably \u201cMetronomy\u201d release,\nwith second album Nights Out getting a\nreasonable amount of critical attention,\nif not quite proving the breakthrough it\ndeserved to be. It was in 2011, with The\nEnglish Riviera, that Metronomy finally became the big deal they\u2019d always\nthreatened to become. Big hits The Look and The Bay, along with a Mercury\nprize nomination, saw a huge incerase in both sales and interest. This is the first\ntime they\u2019ve had to deal with expectation, so can they pull it off?\nLead single I\u2019m Aquarius, released last November, definitely raised\nexpectationsfurther.Itwasthesamesleek,sexyelectropopthatmadethemsuch\na hit, but that\u2019s no bad thing. The rest of the album is a lot more adventurous,\nand it\u2019s hard to know how to feel about it. The Upsetter and Monstrous are really\nwashed out and dreamy, whilst Love Letters has a stomping honky tonk piano\nthat could work in an Elton John track. Month of Sundays sounds like early\nShins with synths (which obviously works), before developing into an almost\nPinkFloydforthemodernagetypeaffair(whichobviouslydoesn\u2019t).BoyRacers\nis a sleek, instrumental electropop track, but it comes across a bit like Hot Chip\nhaving a really bad day rather than as anything of interest. Call Me is possibly\nthe highlight for me. Frantic and angular, with Joe\u2019s breathy high pitched vocals\nat their very best. It\u2019s an absolute belter. The Most Immaculate Haircut is not.\nQuite bizarrely, it\u2019s a fairly average indie rock track. Reservoir is another great\nelectropop track but then Never Wanted sounds like the worst of the 80s.\nThe album is fairly incohesive. There are some really great tracks here, but\nthere\u2019s also a few real missteps. It seems like they were scared of falling into the\ntrap of just reproducing The English Riviera and have ended up trying too hard\nto be different. The result is a bit messy, and on some levels really frustrating.\nThe best tracks here sound like natural progressions from Nights Out and The\nEnglish Riviera, and if they\u2019d just let this album come naturally I think it could\nhave been highly enjoyable. As it is, it\u2019s definitely not an album I\u2019m going to be\nrevisiting in full. This is definitely ripe for cherry picking.\nMetronomy - Love Letters\nway for the band to come in, slowing\nbuilding up to a climax. The crowd\nunderstandably went wild, moving in\nwaves forward and back. People were\nfalling over constantly. People at the\nfront were being crushed. There were\nmosh pits all over the Palace and then\nthey played their next track, Hummer,\none of their brilliant first singles which\nthey did not even put onto their debut\nalbum Antidotes. This would normally\nbe a type of song which people\nwouldn\u2019t necessarily know and a risky\nchoice to put so early. Not so for Foals.\nThe live version is different to the\nstudio version and it works just like\nevery other song with people singing\nand dancing like crazy as if it was an\nalbum song.\nWhilst the older material made the\ncrowd go wild, the songs from Holy\nFire produce an even greater reaction.\nDuring My Number, the ultimate antiValentine\u2019s Day song, the crowd was\nsinging much louder than the band\ncould play and you couldn\u2019t really hear\nvocalist Yannis Philippakis, during\nit. Perhaps he was just admiring his\nwork as he orchestrated the crowd\nwith ease. The waves of people\npushing forward and back continued.\nThe crowd had not eased up as they\nmay have done for other bands and\nthis was due to the hits continually\ncoming. I was told by a random person\n\u201cdon\u2019t go near the front, you will die\u201d;\nthat certainly didn\u2019t stop me or others\ndoing so.\nProvidence was a particular\nhighlight for me, as the mosh pit\nopened up once again, taking over\neasily half the width of Alexandra\nPalace. People then kneeled down and\nstarted hitting the ground like it was\na tribal ritual. Soon there was a mass\nof people hitting the ground, and then,\nas expected the crowd rushed into the\npit and went in for the party of their\nlives. Foals definitely know how to\nhave a party and they were making\nit extra special after having been\n\u201ceverywhere to Timbuktu\u201d and all they\nwanted to do was to \u201ccome back and\nplay here\u201d. Despite this, Philippakis\ndid not jump from balconies feet first,\nas he had done in Dublin, but merely\nclimbed up the speakers at one point.\nDid it make a difference to the show\nthey gave? Hell no. They don\u2019t need\ntricks, crazy stunts or a light show\nto make a great gig. However, I must\npoint out that they got their light show\ngoing with lasers after Philippakis was\nrequested to \u201cget your tits out or your\nlasers\u201d.\nSpanish Sahara, from Total Life\nForever, was a slower song but it\nhad a great light show with the\naforementioned lasers, and it led\nto a massive sing-along once again.\nWhen you hear 10,000 people\nsinging along to the same song, it is\njust unexplainable and it is the most\nincredible thing. The band ended their\nmain setlist with Inhaler where the\nband let rip with their instruments\nand the crowd bounced even more so\nthan before.\nThe band then left after a criminally\nshort eleven song main set. They had\ncertainly pleased me with this but I\nwas waiting, for I knew more had to\ncome, and it sure did. Coming on for\nThe French Open, it was all coming\ntogether for the end: Two Steps Twice.\nThis is easily one of the best songs to\nend a show. Like Prelude, they built\nit up slowly but over a longer time,\naround eight minutes of building\nup in fact. The crowd was still going\nwild, again hitting the ground like a\ntribe, but now, possibly, beginning to\ntire. That is until the legendary \u2018Baba-ba-ba\u2019 part and the drums kick in\nand everyone is screaming \u201cThat\u2019s one\nstep, one step, two step\u201d. The crowd\nreaches its climax and so did Foals.\nIn that one minute of the end of Two\nSteps Twice, Foals had cemented their\nplace as one of the best live bands. I\nleft in pain, with a bruise over my\nface, a lost phone (kinda worth it) and\nsaddened that this was the end of the\nshow. For this reason, I can not wait\nfor September where I will be at the\nfront watching them headline Bestival.\nA short 13 song set would leave\nsome disappointed after three\namazing albums for some bands but\nnot for those who had seen Foals on\nValentine\u2019s Day at Alexandra Palace,\nor at any day/place, for they are quite\npossibly the best live band in the UK.\nStuart Masson\nT\nhe Strypes are a young\nband, having just released\ntheir debut album Snapshot\nin late 2013. They are\nalso young in that every\nmember is under the age of 19. Their\nlack of original songs doesn\u2019t stop\nthem from playing a blistering set of\n23 songs in Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire,\nmainly thanks to them playing a lot of\ncovers from bands such as Ramones\n(Rockaway Beach) and The Kingsmen\n(Louie Louie) on top of their own\nsongs.\nThe Strypes have not produced\nanything groundbreaking, instead\ntaking very strong influences from 60s\nand 70s music, as evident from their\ncovers. This makes for a really fun\ntime.\nStarting with What a Shame, it\ncertainly isn\u2019t a shame as the crowd\nopens up a mosh pit from the start\nand it never goes away due to this\nband making sure the crowd has a fun\ntime. They smash through songs in\nquick time, but they never feel rushed\nand the crowd were in for a great\nrock\u2019n\u2019roll party. It is evident that\nthey have learnt a lot from their time\nsupporting Arctic Monkeys during\ntheir AM tour (although sadly not\nAlex Turner\u2019s witty lyric-writing).\nThis is a very new band and they\nshould be proud of what they have\ndone in such a small amount of time,\nparticularly their live show which\ninvolves the crowd a great deal. They\nshould be able to make the step-up\nto Brixton if they were to make a few\nmore albums. They play so well that\nthey deserve to be one of the next big\nbands but, unfortunately, Snapshot\nwas definitely not one of the better\nalbums of last year.\nWith such a limited number of\noriginal songs, they manage to play\nStrypes - obvious pattern with mixed results\nAiden Langan\nMusic Writer\nthrough the whole album, albeit in\na different order. However, it is the\ncovers that show the band at their\nbest. Perhaps with a few better songs,\nthey will be more than a very good\ncover band.\nEnding with You Can\u2019t Judge a Book\nby the Cover, this is not a band who\npeople should judge by their age but\nby their music, which they perform\nreally well. They need to continue\ntheir great live show, but with more of\ntheir own songs for next time.\nAiden Langan gives his thoughts as love is in the air with Foals at Ally Pally\n\n"

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nFEATURES\nEditor: Shiladitya\nGhosh\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nSession XV: LIMUN 2014\nBACKGROUND:\nFor the third consecutive year, the\nLondon International Model United\nNations Conference (LIMUN) was\nheld at Imperial College London\nand Central Hall Westminster. This\nconference, which is run by a Londonbased charity, brought together 1504\ndelegates, 65 chairs and 38 organising\nstaff for three days of debating,\nnetworking, brainstorming and\nmeeting new people. This conference\nis the largest Model United Nations\n(MUN) conference in Europe and\nis regarded as one of the best in\nthe world. As it takes place on the\nImperial College South Kensington\nCampus, many students from\nImperial, as members of the Imperial\nCollege Model United Nations\nSociety (ICMUN), participate in\nboth the organisation and debating\nof the conference. This year, we had\nImperial students at every level, from\nthe Secretariat to the Logistics Staff.\nHere are some of their comments on\nLIMUN and Model United Nations in\ngeneral.\nCommentary from Philippe Rival,\nDeputy Secretary-General of the\nLIMUN 2014 Conference:\n\u201cI have been part of LIMUN for\n3 years now, first as a Delegate,\nthen as a Chair, and this year as\nDeputy Secretary-General. Being an\nImperial College student myself, I\nmanaged logistics for the conference\nhere on campus and liaised with\nImperial from the beginning. I was\nalso in charge of the Opening and\nClosing Ceremonies, which took\nplace at Central Hall Westminster\nand the Imperial College Great Hall\nrespectively. I was additionally in\ncharge of communications and PR,\nwriting both the Delegate Handbook\nand promotional material and giving\nthe Keynote Speeches during both of\nthe Ceremonies. This was one of the\nmost rewarding, eye-opening and\ntremendous experiences of my life so\nfar! It is well worth both the time and\nthe effort!\u201d\n\u201cI often get asked why I commit so\nmuch of an already busy schedule to\nthis charity and the Model United\nNations Community. I do it because\nI believe the new world we are\nmoving into is no fan of the \u201csilos\u201d\nmentality that has prevailed in the\npast. Leaders of tomorrow will not\nbe the ultra-specialised, but those\nwho can combine expertise with\napplicable, transferable skills in\nmany different fields. In a university\nsuch as Imperial, we sometimes give\ntoo much importance to being the\nbest in one field, and we loose our\nglobal perspective in the process.\nEngineers, scientists and specialist\nhave tremendous skills and knowledge\nin their field, but come short when it\ncomes to advertising their groundbreaking ideas and communicating\ntheir work to the world and to the\ngeneral public. I believe Engineers\nneed a marketing course. Model\nUnited Nations, debating, presenting,\npublic speaking, these are skills that an\nImperial College Degree does not train\nfor, but that make all the difference to\nyour Profile in the professional world.\nI highly recommend and encourage\nany Imperial student to broaden\ntheir perspective and their skillset\nby learning new skills and adding to\nwhat will for sure be an outstanding\nacademic profile. I know first hand\nthat stepping into a new and unknown\nfield can be daunting, but it is when\nthose situations work out that we feel\nthe most joy and pride in out work.\u201d\nCommentary from Richard Tao\nJunrui, a third year Chemical\nEngineering student, Chair of the\nWorld Health Organisation 2014\nSimulation:\n\u201cIt was a great honour chairing the\nWHO, because that\u2019s the perfect place\nto go if Imperial students are ever\nlooking for a job in the UN. It was a\ngreat experience to spread scientific\nknowledge in writing for a wide range\nof audience, so that politicians, lawyers\nand economists from international\nuniversities could also understand the\nmessage. Although on Friday there\nwere delegates who did not know that\nviruses are different from bacteria,\nand thought that Panadol was a form\nof antibiotics, they became very\nknowledgeable over the conference.\nThey passed resolutions that\nwould clearly benefit the scientific\ncommunity, such as creating more job\nopportunities for medics to improve\nsexualhealthoftheworld\u2019spopulation,\nand increasing funding for further\nR&D into antibiotics development.\nWhen they become the future policy\nPhilippe Rival\nDeputy Secretary-General of LIMUN 2014; President of ICMUN;\n3rd--Year Civil Engineer @ Imperial\nThe London International Model United Nations 2014 Conference was hosted by Imperial\nCollege last weekend.

    "content": "27\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 28 FEB\nFILM\nStranger by the Lake\nDirector: Alain Guiraudie\nWriter: Alain Guiraudie\nStarring: Pierre Deladonchamps,\nChristophe Paou, Patrick d\u2019Assum\u00e7ao\nRuntime: 97 minutes\nCertification: 18\nFred Fyles\nTreasured Writer\nWith perhaps the notable exception\nof \u2018literally\u2019, it is difficult to think of a\nword in the English language that is\nused so extensively and erroneously\nas \u2018Hitchcockian\u2019. A word that actually applies to a very certain set of\ncriteria, used extensively by the great\nAlfred Hitchcock in his innumerable\nfilms, has now become so diluted as to\nhave lost its meaning. An icy blonde?\nHitchcockian. A false accusation?\nHitchcockian. Any hint of tension?\nSo Hitchcockian. This makes is all the\nmore refreshing to use the word to\ndescribe Alain Guiraudie\u2019s latest film\nStranger by the Lake, a shimmering\nmirage of tension, deceit, and dan-ger, that fully deserves the moniker of\n\u2018Hitchcockian\u2019.\nTaking place at an idyllic lake in the\nsouth of France, Stranger by the Lake\nunfolds over the course of ten consecutive days; men swim in the water,\nsunbathe, and go off to have furtive\nsex in the bushes. Guiraudie establishes the setting as a tranquil oasis; a\nnew Eden just down the road from St.\nTropez. But things are not quite right,\nand there is a threat that hangs over\nthe paradise far more insidious than\nunprotected sex, or the 15 foot silurus\nthat supposedly lurks in the depths: a\nkiller is on the loose, and after a body\nturns up in the lake the film takes a\nsharp left-turn into thriller territory.\nWe follow the story of Franck\n(Pierre Deladonchamps), a young\ngay man who is a yearly visitor to\nthe beach. On his first day he notices\nHenri (Patrick D\u2019Assum\u00e7ao), a portly\nman who sits alone, far away from the\nothers on the beach; he strikes up a\nfriendly conversation, only to find out\nthat Henri is there because his girlfriend just left him, and that he is in\nno way whatsoever there for \u2018cruising\u2019.\nHowever, Henri turns out to be far less\nenigmatic than Michel (Christophe\nPaou), a tall, dark adonis who rocks\na 70s-esque porn tasche. He catches\nFranck\u2019s eye, who attempts to follow\nhim into the woods, only to find that\nhe is already involved with someone;\nlater that night Franck overhears an\nargument, and spies Michel drowning his lover in the lake. Rather than\ngo straight to the police, Franck fights\nan interior battle between fear and\nlust, with the latter eventually winning out. But when an inspector arrives a few days later we are plunged\ninto a tightly wound drama; a matter\nof life-or-death\nGuiraudie is a master of tension.\nShooting the lake in long, languid\nshots, he eschews the short, snappy\nediting favoured by many directors\nwho attempt to make thrillers. The\nresults are dramatic, and we are left\nwith the feeling that at any time the\npeaceful images could come crashing\ndown around us. The action is confined to three locations: the car park,\nthe woods, and the lake. What was\nonce a sunny ideal suddenly becomes\nsweltering, and the audience is left\nperspiring in the oppressive heat. The\ncamera, like Franck, is trapped, and\nthis feeling of claustrophobia is transferred to the viewer. Another interestingly subversive move by Guiraudie is\nthe lack of a soundtrack; rather than\nrely on stabbing strings to let us know\nwhen the drama is occurring, we are\nleft with just the sounds of the lake:\nrustling of trees, splashing of water,\nand the wafting wind. These build up\nan atmosphere of extreme tension, but\nat the same time remain magnificently\nsubtle.\nThis is a maaaaaaaaaaaaaan\u2019s world\nLike its contemporary Blue is the\nWarmest Colour, Stranger by the Lake\nhas come under fire from some parties about nudity that could be seen\nas gratuitous. However, the focus of\nthe film is never on the sex, explicit\nthough it may be, but is instead about\nthe tension; tensions between Franck\nand Michel, between the gay community and the authorities, between\nnature and man. While undoubtedly slotting into the Queer Cinema\ncanon, Stranger by the Lake eschews\nthe tropes shown by many other\nfilms centred around similar topics. It\nmakes an interesting companion piece\nto William Friedkin\u2019s 1980 film Cruising, in which Al Pacino immerses\nhimself in the New York S&M scene\nin order to catch a homophobic serial\nkiller; while Cruising, despite sharing\nmany of the same themes as Stranger\nby the Lake, acted as an indictment of\nthe gay community, Guiraudie manages to create a work that explores the\ndangers cruising can pose, while never criticising the practice. In fact, the\nsexuality of the characters becomes\nalmost peripheral, so much so that the\ninspector\u2019s bemusement at the notion\nof two men spending a day having\nsex in the bushes without asking each\nother their names seems jarring, and\nreminds one that even in such an idyllic setting the shadow of homophobia\ncannot be escaped.\nIn Stranger, Guiraudie creates an\nexpertly balanced thriller, full to the\nbrim with danger and erotic tension;\nmeticulously shot, Guiraudie puts us\ninto the role of voyeur, much like the\nyoung men watching each other in\nthe woods. Subtle but intense performances from the leads, especially Deladonchamps, whose inner turmoil is\nperfectly pitched, underpin this startling drama that is guaranteed to keep\naudiences on the edge of their seats.\nStranger is worth seeing for the final\nfive minutes alone, in which Guiraudie provides a deliciously ambiguous\nend scene that\u2019s still playing in my\nmind. A true masterclass of cinema.\n\n"

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nConfessions of a GTA: Part 13\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\nThis week the GTA describes the doom of the non-believer\nI\nn GTA work, a lot depends\non trust from your student.\nSometimes this simply depends\non perceived authority, i.e. you\nare older and wrinklier than\nthem and you\u2019ve been introduced\nby their lecturer, therefore you must\nknow something, right? The nicest\ntimes are when it depends on a\nrelationship built up over several\nsessions when a student really believes\nthrough your umming and ahhhhing\nthat you will be able to help them,\nwell\u2026 eventually.\nThese are the best kinds of students\nbecause even if you don\u2019t know the\nanswer straight away they believe\nin you enough they will give you\nthe \u2018benefit of the doubt\u2019. This is a\nprecious thing for a GTA. I teach\non around four classes a week on\naverage. This can add up to hundreds\nof questions. With maximum one\nhour of preparation time to make the\nsession worth the cash, it means that\nat the drop of a hat, I probably will not\nremember one question from another.\nThus, that question that the students\nhave been ripping their hair out over\nfor weeks, I have probably seen for, at\nmaximum, two minutes.\nI do understand the frustration.\nThese questions are occasionally\nimpossible until you have seen the\nanswer. I remember those days where\nI just had to know what the heck\nwas going wrong with my work right\nnow, if not 2 days ago. However, I\nhave found the students who give\nme a grace period of 2 seconds get\na far more coherent answer, even\nsometimes in sentence form.\nYet what a GTA fears most is the\nloss of this trust. If you take a fraction\nof a second too long to answer, or you\ncome out with something initially\nthat the student was not expecting,\nthat\u2019s it. They become a non-believer.\nNo matter how well you explain it\nafterwards or how brilliant your\ndiagramis,theydonotcare.Itbecomes\nlike an awkward conversation in a bar.\nThey keep looking around you to see if\nthey know somebody, anyone else so\nthey can get the hell out of there.\nToday, I explained a question, from\nfirst principles, using a rigorous\nmathematical proof. The student did\nnot believe me because he could not\n\u2018imagine\u2019 it to be that way. The proof\nwas there right in front of him, maybe\nnot beautifully explained but at least\nwritten down. When he asked the\nsame answer to the lecturer, they\nanswered, and I quote, \u201cbecause it is\u201d.\nQuite literally three words and the\nstudent accepted it. Three words.\nTherefore my confession for this\nweek: give your GTA the benefit\nof the doubt. Even if they look like\na bumbling fool for the first three\nminutes, they might surprise you.\nR\necently the Imperial\nCollege chess team arrived\nback from BUCA. After\nmultiple rounds, Imperial\nmanaged to dominate\nthe entire tournament. It was a great\nweekend of fun and exciting chess\ngames. However, throughout the\nevent, one thing particularly struck\nme. Of a group of more than a 70\npeople, I could have counted the\nnumber of women at this entire event\non two hands, maybe even one. Yet\non average, men and women are\ndistributed fairly evenly throughout\nthe globe. The ratio of the two genders\nis close to 1:1. Why was it something\nlike 15 to one at this tournament? After\nI got home I did my own research into\nthis and found some really astounding\nfacts: no woman has ever been world\nchampion; there are only 30 women\nwho are full Grandmasters (when\nthere are actually 1,192 GMs); and and\nand. The list goes on and on. Women\nare woefully underrepresented in this\nfamous game. Why is chess considered\nsuch a mans sport?\nLet us first get all the rubbish out\nof the way: it does not require any\ndexterity, strength or speed \u2013 only\nyour own brain power. Men and\nwomen are not different in any way\nif we just measure them by their\nintelligence. Therefore, there should\nbe no reason why as many women as\nmen shouldn\u2019t compete at all levels.\nThroughout the early stages of\nchess, e.g. the middle ages, chess\nwas played by women and men alike.\nHowever, somewhat inexplicably, as\ntime progressed this ancient game was\nmore and more dominated by men.\nFurthermore in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies, roughly 5% of tournament\nplayers have been of the fairer sex.\nIn addition, and this is what I find\nthe strangest, FIDE (the world chess\norganisation) introduced specific\nwoman\u2019s titles. So, for example, you\nhave a normal GM, which is highest\nattainable title in chess, and then you\nhave a Woman Grandmaster. Not only\ndo we have a distinct title, but to add\ninsult to injury, the requirements for\nattaining one are much easier. It is as if\nFIDE is saying that, yes women can be\nGMs, but they need to be separate and\nmean less than a normal GM.\nThis attitude that men and women\nneed to be judged differently in this\nsport is the crux of the problem. Yes,\nI agree that in some sports it makes\nsense to have different competitions,\nranking etc. but why in chess?\nAnother aspect that I believe hinders\nwomen into getting chess as much\nas men is the the general perception\nof chess players. Since chess is the\nultimate logical sport, men are seen\nas the best gender as they are, oh, so\nmuch more logical, just like in the\nSTEM subjects. I mean honestly, if\nI asked you on the fly right now, to\nname five women who were a great\nchess players, you would stumble a bit\n(hopefully you could name five chess\nplayers though!). This \u2018public opinion\u2019\nhas also lead to less encouragement\nby parents, sponsors and clubs to try\nand get women to actually try playing\nchess.\nAs an avid chess player, I think it is\nquite sad that such a significant part of\nthe population does not get as much\nsupport to try playing chess. The\nwealth of talent that probably goes\nwasted is a crime. I believe that there\nisn\u2019t a more equal game, where two\nhuman beings, independent of gender,\nage or origin can play a fair game, so\nwhy not let all have a go at it?\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames and Tech Editor\nWhere are the Queens in Chess?\nvintageprintable.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "29\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 28 FEB\nFILM\nnish troublemaker\nDogville\nDirector: Lars von Trier\nWriter: Lars von Trier\nStarring: Nicole Kidman, Paul\nBettany, Patricia Clarkson, Stellan\nSkarsg\u00e5rd, Lauren Bacall\nRuntime: 178 minutes\nCertification: 15\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nFor someone who directs his leading\nactresses so well, Dogville is most certainly one of his best, most intriguing\nworks to date. We are introduced to\nGrace (Kidman), a woman with a mysterious past and emotional baggage\nwho stumbles upon a small American village. The residents there appear friendly enough when she passes\nby, but it\u2019s a whole different story as\nshe tries to integrate herself into their\nsmall, well-built, tight society. They\nare not fond of change, and a random inclusion of an obvious outsider\ndoesn\u2019t sit too comfortably with some\nof the village people. Especially when\nit is revealed that Grace is somehow\nwanted by gun-wielding gangsters.\nHer presence poses danger, but thanks\nto the helpful Tom (Paul Bettany) who\ninstantly has some sort of protective\nand emotional feelings towards the\nmodest lady, she is allowed to stay in\nreturn for doing chores for the villag-ers, which she does happily. After all,\nshe is running away from something\nthat sounds quite violent and dodgy,\nthe least she can do is to participate in\nthe community.\nFrom the opening sequence it becomes painfully apparent that Dogville\nisoneriskypicturefromadirectorwho\nhas the well-deserved reputation of\nbeing the \u2018enfant terrible\u2019 of European\nCinema. Split into nine long chapters\nincluding a prologue, the film sums up\nin just under three hours, in which the\never-so fragile and pale looking Kidman goes through all sorts of horrible\nordeals, just for wanting to fit in. As if\nthe film is set on stage, von Trier takes\na bold move in hardly including any\nerect set pieces. So no doors, no street\nmarks, no grass, just a lamp post and a\nfew scattered walls to signal the presence of houses. The opening of doors,\nacted out by all the actors, with sound\nperfectly matched to the film\u2019s action,\nit feels like we\u2019re watching a play, and\na darkly bleak one at that as well. The\nstage is painted with black, white, grey\nand the occasional brown, being set in\nan abandoned silver mine, the colour\nchoices seem sensible, and we know\nthat despite Grace\u2019s best efforts, her\nhappy days among this grim looking\nvillage will not last long.\nWhere does it all go wrong for\nGrace? It starts to go downhill as everyone begins to realise what the cost\nof hiding Grace will be. The police\nare constantly putting up flyers with\nher face and name on them, and they\nare being insistent that she is a dan-gerous. They feel she should do more\nwork. She complies. But she\u2019s human\nand she is capable of making mis-takes. Even the tiniest mistakes don\u2019t\nsit well with the already highly tense\nand alert group of people. Tension\nrises. Sexually frustrated men start\nmaking advances on the poor, helpless\nwoman. Can Grace fight off a butch\nman? Hardly. She gives in, and is given\nthe cold shoulder from the women of\nthe village. The men only view her as\na sexual object. What a downfall \u2013 to\ngo from a cleaner one day to a serially\nraped victim who has no one to turn\nto. And von Trier still won\u2019t admit this\nis a depressing film.\nJust what is Grace hiding? After a\nwhile, it ceases to matter, as we are all\nso caught up in the spiraling drama\nshe finds herself in. Within minutes\nshe is the most hated person in the vil-lage, and at one point in the film, she\nfinds herself in shackles. She tried to\nrun away, you see. Even the characters who showed faith and sympathy\ntowards Grace, as the film progresses,\nturn into enemies. But this change\nis never forced, which is something\nvon Trier excels in. Nothing feels unnatural or too contrived. His storytelling skills, although it takes a while, is\na deep and enriching experience to\nfully soak up, as we can examine the\nslow development of relationships\nthat Grace forms with the residents\nof Dogville. Human connection is not\nbuilt in seconds but days, weeks and\nmonths. And this is shown with restraint and von Trier is not afraid to\ntake his time with drawing as many\nengaging sub-plots as he can.\nAnd what a fascinating cast he managed to end up with. Kidman, whose\nweak, tired presence alone shrieks the\nword \u2018victim,\u2019 is further able to effectively stir up sympathy without being\nan overly dumb or na\u00efve stereotype.\nBut it\u2019s also the frightening supporting\nturns who brew the uneasy ambiance\nof Dogville. Lauren Bacall, playing\nthe role of Ma Ginger, a local shopkeeper who seems to be a nice old\nlady with a big heart, shows that she\nis made of steel if needs be. Patricia\nClarkson, a reserved-looking friendly\nneighbour, has a dark and vengeful\nside who participates in one of the\nmost heartbreaking scenes in the film.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, playing Clarkson\u2019s\nhusband, is one of the many men who\npushes himself onto Grace. His sleazy,\ncreepy performance has an unpredictable twist that adds more horror\nto Dogville. Bettany, who starts off\nas a friend of Grace, is the voice and\npersuader of Dogville. He sways the\npeople\u2019s emotions, so if you cross him,\nwhich Grace of course does (not in a\nvindictive way of course \u2013 there is a\nseries of misunderstandings, painful\nmiscommunication and a blow to his\nego), the consequences will be severe.\nDespite its hefty running time, Dogville is filled with moments to treasure.\nIt\u2019s a true success in experimental film\nmaking with all of von Trier\u2019s gambles\npaying off perfectly. The loud, violent\ncrescendo of the final act will bring\nabout all sorts of conflicting emotions,\nranging from relief, horror, sadness\nand possibly guilt. It\u2019s a challenging\nwatch, but an immensely rewarding\none, with a stunning cast who sadly\nwent unappreciated in many awards,\ndirected by a man whose often contro-versial, odd remarks have put people\noff even before they sit down to watch\none of his films. Dogville is a unique\nand powerful film that looks at a community\u2019s dynamic in the most brutal\nand uncomfortable way \u2013 and yes,\nit\u2019s not pleasant to see so many human beings portrayed like monsters\non screen. But then again, if enough\npeople come together and a deep dark\ncrisis hits, who wouldn\u2019t show a hint\nof selfish survival instinct in desperate situations? It\u2019s a cynical view of\ncourse, but that\u2019s what von Trier is all\nabout: digging out the cynics inside us\nall, portraying the world in the most\nnegative, but oddly plausible light.\n\n"

The Black Cats have played so\nmuch better in the cup than the league\nthis year, and credit to Gus Poyet for\nmasterminding so many shock scalps\nalong the way, but this will surely be\none hurdle too far.\nPrediction: 2-0\nSouthampton v Liverpool\n(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nThis is intriguing because Saints continue to look the real deal while the\nReds\u2019 attacking diamond has been\nprolific of late. Expect goals, that\u2019s\nfor sure, but Liverpool showed real\ncharacter to come from behind twice\nagainst Fulham in their last away\nmatch and I can see a similar story\npanning out at St Mary\u2019s.\nPrediction: 2-3\nAston Villa v Norwich\n(Sunday 4:30pm, Sky Sports 1)\nI fear the Canaries\u2019 victory against\nSpurs last weekend was just a flash in\nthe pan; Chris Hughton desperately\nneeds his attackers to start scoring\ngoals Despite their home difficulties, I\nam sure Villa\u2019s manager Paul Lambert\nwould love to get one over his former\nclub.\nPrediction: 2-1\nBest of the rest\n(Saturday 3pm unless stated)\nHull v Newcastle\nEven when they beat Aston Villa, the\nMagpies do not look the same side\nwith nothing to play for and without\ntheir playmaker Yohan Cabaye. Steve\nBruce has said he would love to do the\ndouble over Newcastle, and it\u2019s a great\nchance to stave off any lingering relegation fears.\nPrediction: 2-1\nStoke v Arsenal\nThe Potters give everyone a game\nat the Britannia Stadium and have\nclaimed 4 points off the Gunners\u2019 title\nrivals Man City and Chelsea already\nthis season. I don\u2019t think Arsenal will\nbe able to live with Stoke\u2019s abrasive\nstyle which will allow for precious few\nfree-flowing moves.\nPrediction: 1-1\nSwansea v Crystal Palace\n(Sunday 4:30)\nThe Swans could probably do without\nthe distraction of the Europa League\nright now, although Garry Monk is exactly the kind of manager players will\nrespond to even if they are in need of\na break. Palace may be in fine home\nform but they have to sit back on the\nroad and the points continue to elude\nthem.\nPrediction: 2-1\nGETTY IMAGES\nIC take positives from\ndifficult Kendo meet\nJake Humphrey gives his account\nThe first part of any competition is\ngetting to the competition, but Britain never was renowned for having\ngood weather. This stayed true with\nthe storm the day before causing de-lays, confusion and ultimately pushing\nback the competition start time. But it\nmeant we got a lie-in before the tour-nament, which is always nice especially after a Friday night. This year it was\nheld in Canterbury at the University of\nKent with twelve different universities\ncompeting. Some universities fielded\nseveral teams leading to one large ac-tion-packed competition.\nFirst up was the Kyu-grade tournament for people with less than three\nyears of experience, which are relatively small fry compare to the Dangrade black belts. However no one\ntold them this, and they fought with\nall their spirit and confidence. There\nwere nine in total representing Imperial in the Kyu-grade, though unfortunately in the second round, two\nImperial comrades, Rene Wong and\nAdam Gestwa, had to fight it out in\nan intense match. In the end, Joseph\nYao, Adam Gestwa, Edward Ying, and\nJason Li were knocked out in the quar-terfinals.\nNext was the Dan-grade, with five\n\u201csamurai\u201d representing our club.\nUnfortunately the men faced formidable foes, with Jake Humphrey\u2019s opponent going on to place first. This resulted in first round losses across the\nboard, but our warriors gave their opponents long hard-fought battles. In\nthe ladies\u2019 competition, Luz Nguyen\nperformed exceptionally throughout\nthe day fighting off numerous competitors to obtain a well-earned and\nhard-fought third place.\nAfter a day\u2019s worth of \u2018practice\u2019,\nit was now time to show Imperial\u2019s\nstrength in the teams\u2019 competition.\nThis was also split into Kyu and Dan\ngrade. Initially the Kyu team was up\nagainst York. The first match was a\ndraw followed by a loss (however,\nAdam was still able to score a point\nwith men (head) strike). Next up was\nYihan Ng and Edward Ying who both\ndrew 0:0. This left a lot of pressure on\nJoseph who had to win against the\nvery same person who knocked him\nout yesterday. He gave his rival no\nchance with a volley of attacks at a furious rate scoring men quickly. As a\nresult, the teams drew in both wins\nand points so Joseph, tired from the\nlast match, had to fight again in the\nrepresentative match. The rules were\nfirst to score with no time limit so Joseph once again had to unleash the\nbeast. This match lasted several minutes of intense fighting before Joseph\nscore the winning men cut.\nImmediately afterwards we went\nstraight into the next match against\nEdinburgh A. The first match was\nover very quickly with Jason Li losing two men in quick succession\nagainst the Kyu-grade men\u2019s cham-pion. However, Adam evened it out\nby winning his match with a men\ncut. The next two matches were\nclose with both Yihan and Edward\nputting up a good fight against their\nmore experienced opponents, which\nresulted in another loss and another\nwin. Now once again Joseph had the\ndeciding match. Despite being tired,\nas soon as his foe even twitched, he\nscored a men strike. However, his adversary managed to score back two\nmen strikes resulting in our overall\nloss. Edinburgh A later on went on\nto win the whole competition and\nwe came third so the outcome was\nnot too negative.\nJoseph was also awarded with the\nBest Fighting Spirit prize due to his\nexceptional performance throughout the entire championship.\nNext up was the Dan-grade team\nhoping to follow in the success for\nthe Kyu team. Unfortunately for\nthem they had to face the eventual\nwinners of the competition, Edinburgh (again), at their very first\nround. But by no means were they\nsimply pushed over, fighting with\ngreat determination and spirit losing\nonly two matches out of five.\nNext year the Taikai will be held\nat the University of Gloucestershire\nin the tranquil town of Cheltenham.\nTranquil, that is, until the masses of\nshinai-wielding students descend\nupon it and start shouting their battle cry \u2018men\u2019, which will definitely\nliven up the town. That will also be\nwhen we get our own back onEdin-burgh (and all the other teams) and\nwin.\n\u2018MEN!\u2019\nIC KENDO\nFulham v Chelsea\nFelix Magath has no settling-in time at\nCraven Cottage and with local bragging rights at stake, Fulham should\ngive Chelsea a game here, especially if\nthey are still weary from their trip to\nGalatarasay midweek. But the Blues\u2019\nclass should prevail over the 90 min-utes.\nPrediction: 0-2\nTottenham v Cardiff\n(Sunday 4:30)\nAfter defeat at Norwich last week-end, Tim Sherwood\u2019s Spurs have to\nkeep winning to keep alive any lingering hopes of a top 4 finish. The Bluebirds are not showing the characteristic spirit relegation battlers need to\nsurvive at the moment. That has to\nchange, and fast.\nPrediction: 2-0\nEverton v West Ham\nThe Toffees might struggle to create\nchances here as Sam Allardyce will get\n10 men behind the ball and play the\nlong ball game up to a lone striker. But\nthey should make the breakthrough\nat some stage, certainly if Romelu Lukaku is back fit.\nPrediction: 1-0\nMIKE REGAN / GETTY IMAGES\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTom Rivlin\u2019s Cartoon Corner\nInvader Zim\nInvader Zim is definitely one of those\n\u2018cult classic\u2019 shows. It ran for two seasons on Nickelodeon about 13 years\nago, with minimal ratings, dodgy\ntimeslots, and a cult following that\npersists to this day. But you know how\nit is with sci-fi cult classic TV shows\nthat ran for like two episodes in the\nearly 2000s before being cancelled \u2013\nthe fans just never shup up!\nSo, the plot: bug-eyed, green alien\nZim is sent to Earth by the mighty\nTallest of the Irken Empire, along with\nhis faithful robot sidekick, to infiltrate\nit in preparation for its invasion... or so\nZim thinks. In reality, he\u2019s been sent to\nEarth to keep him out of trouble because he\u2019s so incompetent. They didn\u2019t\neven bother to load the robot sidekick\nwith a brain (which in this universe\ntranslates to him being really stupid).\nUpon arrival on Earth, he successfully\ninfiltrates the local school (this is the\nkind of show where school is spelled\n\u201cSkool\u201d) with only contact lenses as a\ndisguise (the green skin is a \u2018skin condition\u2019, of course). The only human\nwho sees through his act is a budding\nparanormal investigator, a classmate\ncalled Dib. Dib is, of course, called\ncrazy for believing Zim is an alien.\nInvader Zim was created by Jhonen\nVasquez, who is mostly known for one\nother work \u2013 a comic called Johnny the\nHomicidal Maniac, which should tell\nyou all you need to know about him,\nreally. Vasquez clearly despises the\nhuman race. All of the humans (except\nfor Dib and his sister, Gaz) in the show\nare shown to be incredibly stupid \u2013\nblind to the poorly disguised alien\namong them, slaves to their corporate\noverlords and to societal pressures,\nignorant of any existence beyond TV\nand fast food. It\u2019s an oppressively cynical and bleak outlook that the show\npresents, and yet one can\u2019t help but\nfeel drawn in by it and agreeing with it\nto a large extent. It\u2019s an effective use of\nexaggeration for both comedic effect\nand to prove a point.\nThe show is also infused with a wonderful hyperactive energy; watching\nan episode is like being injected with\npure sugar. It isn\u2019t just great for kids\n\u2013 it makes you feel like a kid again.\nThat said, it can also be incredibly\ndark. One episodes ends with Zim\nremoving a child\u2019s eyes and replacing\nthem with robotic ones, which we are\nshown through shadows. It may be sil-houetted, but what he\u2019s doing is very\nclear from what we can see. The show\nmay have been on Nickelodeon, but it\ndefinitely had an Adult Swim vibe to\nit, and it\u2019s clear why Nick wanted this\nshow axed ASAP: unlike the other\ncartoon in this week\u2019s corner, it was\nmeant to be for kids.\nZim was cancelled after 27 episodes,\nbut a cult following still exists. There\nwere some episodes that were recorded but never animated, and there\u2019s\neven been fan attempts to animate\nthem themselves after the recordings\nwere released, showing the dedication they have to the show. Zim was\ndark, cynical, exciting and hilarious\n(for a given sense of humour), and it\nleft its mark on animation. (Even if for\nno other reason than one storyboard\nartist was Bryan Koneitzko, who used\nthe connections he made on the show\nto pitch Avatar: The Last Airbender to\nNick...)\nCartoons aren\u2019t just for kids. Hopefully this should be common knowledge by now, thanks to shows like\nFamily Guy and South Park. Archer is\na show that is definitely not for kids.\nIt\u2019s a show about an \u2018elite\u2019 group of\nsecret agents working for an organisation called ISIS, who go on exciting\nmissions to exotic locations across the\nglobe. Don\u2019t be fooled by the premise,\nthough, as Archer is most definitely\na comedy, and all of the antics and\nhijinks of the ISIS agents are played\n100% for laughs, and they\u2019re crass,\nrude and funny as hell.\nRefreshingly, despite ostensibly being a show about superspies, most of\nthe drama and plots revolve around\nthe office life of the secret agents.\nOnly two of the characters (including\nthe eponymous Stirling Archer) begin the series as qualified field agents\n(from what I can tell) \u2013 the rest of the\ncast is comprised of the secretary, the\nhead of HR, the accountant, the intelligence analyst, the mad scientist who\ndefinitely isn\u2019t a Nazi in hiding who\nhas an anime hologram wife and, of\ncourse, Archer\u2019s mother, Malory, the\nhead of ISIS. (Mommy issues, much?)\nThis is where the show really shines,\ntoo. All of the office characters are\nwell developed and very quirky, and\nArcher is at its funniest when all of\nthese completely insane characters are\njust messing around in the office being\nthemselves. That isn\u2019t to say that the\nmission plots aren\u2019t entertaining too\n\u2013 watching Archer and Lana (one of\nthe few \u2018competent\u2019 characters) throw\nsnark and bile at each other whilst being shot at by drug lords and terrorists\nand KGB agents and space pirates oh\nmy simply never gets old.\nThe time period in which the show\nis set is described as \u2018comically anachronistic\u2019 \u2013 they make 21st century references and have mobile phones and\nthe internet, but the Cold War is still\ngoing on, they all wear 60s fashion and\ntheir computers look like the bastard\nlovechildren of the BBC Micro and a\nMacintosh 128K. That\u2019s all without\nmentioning the sci-fi elements like cyborgs and holograms (mostly thanks\nto the mad scientist Krieger, whose\nfrequent defiance of all laws of man\nand God in furtherance of his hubris\nand pursuit of knowledge is frequently\nplayed for laughs, whilst being kept\njust mysterious enough to be continuously funny). The Cold War setting is,\nof course, all but essential for a good\nspy vs. spy show, and the show makes\ngood use of it, with Malory, for ex-ample, having a very long-term affair\nwith the head of the KGB. (He could\neven be Archer\u2019s father!)\nThe show recently returned for a\nfifth season, and it\u2019s turning out to\nbe quite different \u2013 it has the title\nArcher: Vice, because it\u2019s a more self-contained arc about the ISIS agents\nselling (literally) a ton of cocaine. It\nseems like the show is playing to its\nstrengths with this premise, as all of\nthe ISIS employees are pitching in\nto the effort, even if it\u2019s in their own\n\u2018special\u2019 way. The majority of the\nshow is on Netflix, so go watch it.\nGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO.\nArcher\n\n"

Starting with\nEntertainment from their recent\nalbum Bankrupt, the crowd went\ncrazy from the start. This was\nunderstandable due to the fact that\nthis was Phoenix\u2019s first UK tour since\nthe Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix days\n(not counting their 2013 show in the\ncriminally small Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nEmpire). Having been around 15\nyears, this band has definitely built up\nto have an incredible live show.\nPlaying many hits from the Grammy\nwinning Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix,\nincluding Lasso and Lisztomania,\nthe band seemed to have a lot of\nfun, despite the little amount of\nconversationwiththecrowd.Regularly\nentering the crowd, vocalist Thomas\nMars caused regular stampedes from\nthe crowd to reach out for him. He did\nthis with what seemed like little care,\nbut every so often you\u2019d get a glimpse\nfrom him and the rest of the band that\nshowed they were having the time of\ntheir lives.\nThey played through many hits\nwhich they have slowly built up over\nthe years and Too Young, from their\nfirst album Untitled, was a nice return\nto their origins and the mixture of\nsongs over their career was a nice\nfeeling, after seeing many bands who\nrarely play their oldest stuff.\nThe most magical moment\nPhoenix rise from the flames\noccurred during the ending of\nSunskrupt! (a mixture of Love Like\nthe Sunset and Bankrupt) when a\nrare mistake occurred. The ending\nseemed ruined as the guitarist and\nbassist could not get the timing right\nbut alas the guitarists stopped, came\ntogether and finished the song with\ntrue style looking into each other and\ncausing a great feeling of intimacy in\nthe 5000-capacity academy.\nCrowd-favourite 1901 caused\neveryone to come closer to Mars again\ndue to his returning to his natural\nposition, on the barrier with the\ncrowd, and Brixton continued to go\nmental. It seemed like a party which\nwould not end. But alas, the band left\nthe stage and the crowd screamed for\nthe return of this French band.\nThey returned and played an eight-song epic encore, which included a\nhuge disco ball for If I Feel Better,\nMars said it was \u201ca dancing song\u201d and\nBrixton sure did dance.\nNicolas Godin from Air entered for\nPlayground Love, an Air song Mars\nguests on. This was a moment which\nonly involved Mars, Godin on piano\nand one guitarist and was a beautiful\nand again intimate moment. Their\nsecond guest was Sebastien Tellier\nwho entered by sitting on a speaker\nand, like Godin, played piano. It was\nan honour to hear Mars sing in French\nfor once with some of Tellier\u2019s songs.\nTellier ended his guestship with a\nguitar solo from Funky Squaredance,\na personal favourite from Untitled,\nand Brixton went mad. I felt Tellier\nwas slightly too obscure for the crowd\nbut it was definitely a nice touch for\nPhoenix to do, who went way past\nwhat needed to be done to make the\ncrowd not only happy but beaming\nwith joy.\nThe encore culminated in Mars\nrunning around Brixton at the end\nand crowd surfing back to the stage in\na reprise of Entertainment. A victory\nlap for an incredible live show and a\nband who you need to see during the\nrare occurrence that they return to the\nUK.\nAiden Langan\nMusic Writer\nLITE by name, full fat by nature\nM\nath rock is a fairly\nniche genre.\nFeaturing a chaotic\nmixture of different\ntime signatures,\ntempo changes and abrupt stylistic\nalterations, its extreme technical\nnature makes it very difficult to play\nand, for a lot of people, very difficult\nto listen to. However, it is a genre with\na very strong cult following, of which\nI would definitely count myself. HOU\nProject are a London-based Japanese\npromotions company who put on\ngigs by Japanese bands who might\notherwise struggle to come to Europe.\nA friend and I went to an all-dayer they\nput on a year or two ago (headlined by\nthe incredible Toe), and it was one of\nthe best days of music I\u2019ve ever been\nto. So, when we saw that they were\nputting on another great Japanese\nmath band, LITE, it was very hard to\nresist.\nThe first act we managed to see\nwas Alarmist. Hailing from Dublin,\nthis instrumental four-piece were\napparently performing for the first\ntime in London. The set delivered\ndidn\u2019t seem to be marked by any nerves\nthough, as they performed a very\ncapable half hour of tight instrumental\nmath rock. They sounded a lot like\nAtlas-era Battles with perhaps less of\nthe pop sensibility. It was definitely an\ninteresting watch, and I\u2019m marking\nthis lot down as one to watch.\nThe next band on were Delta Sleep.\nThey are very clearly a product of\nthe excellent British math rock scene\nfathered by the likes of Colour and\nThis Town Needs Guns. Featuring\nvocals (a one off at this gig) and an\nextremely schizophrenic approach\nto their musical style, they strongly\nreminded me of Tubelord, although\na lot jazzier and featuring a few less\nheavy sections. It\u2019s a sound I absolutely\nadore, and considering that all of\nthe greats in the scene have broken\nup (or replaced their lead singer and\nbecome really shit) a new band taking\nit on with such aplomb is extremely\nexciting.\nI\u2019veactuallyseenThePhysicsHouse\nBand before. I caught them back in\n2012, and I really didn\u2019t enjoy it. It\nwas all a bit too much. Unrelentingly\nloud and fast, it didn\u2019t have any of\nthe subtlety or craft that makes this\ngenre so rewarding to listen to. On\nsome levels, it almost seemed like a\ncartoonish parody of math rock. I may\nhave also somewhat drunkenly and\ncertainly very snobbishly described\nthem as Brontide for morons.\nSeeing them live these days (or\nlistening to their 2013 EP, Horizons /\nRapture) will show you that not much\nhas changed. It\u2019s still all a bit much.\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s not enjoyable.\nThe excellent Titan is a definite\nhighlight. The slow build up to a jazzy,\nmathy jam is a really great blend and it\nshows that they do have the potential\nto write legitimately great music.\nIt\u2019s just they don\u2019t seem to utilise it\nproperly the rest of the time.\nThe rest is the full-on balls-to-the-wall math rock I didn\u2019t really like\nfirst time around. Admittedly, the\nabsolutely phenomenal Abraxical\nSolapse pulls it off by just being, well\nabsolutely phenomenal. It definitely\nshowcases the band\u2019s real ability to\nwrite great catchy, pulsating sections.\nThe fact it jams about 40 of them into\njust over four minutes is a slight issue.\nThe real issue is the rest of the songs,\nwhere half of the upbeat sections aren\u2019t\ncatchy or pulsating. For me, great math\nrock has to ebb and flow. You should\nhave to wait through prettier, softer\nsections to get to the exciting upbeat\nstuff. It\u2019s the context that makes the\ngood bits in songs so good. Imagine a\npop song that was just a long series of\nchoruses, or a Black Sabbath song that\nwas just intro riff after intro riff. You\ncan\u2019t just give people lots of the best\nbits, you have to ration them to give\nthem the full effect.\nI should probably say something\nabout the actual show they put on. It\nwas pretty good. A large proportion\nof the crowd seemed to be enjoying\nit a lot, and I can definitely appreciate\nthey were doing what they do pretty\nwell. The fact I find what they do quite\ntedious did put a bit of a damper on\nit though.\nThe headliners, LITE, really showed\nthe rest of the bands how it\u2019s done.\nOver the course of their hour and a\nquarter long set they managed to be\nboth beautiful and fragile, as well as\ncrushingly heavy and overwhelmingly\njoyous. This was the last date of their\nEuropean tour, and you could tell they\nwanted to go out with a bang. They\ngave it everything, even extending\npast curfew by over half an hour.\nTheir sound is fairly typical of the\nJapanese math rock I\u2019ve heard. A\nheavy reliance on stop start type stuff\nis underpinned with a strong groove\nand a generally uplifting mood. LITE\ndo throw in a bit of a heavier edge into\nsome of their stuff, with the overall\neffect being absolutely sensational.\nMath rock at its best has all the\ntechnicality without sounding like\nit. LITE have an uncanny knack for\nthis. They make it sound so easy,\nwhen in reality, a copy of the sheet\nmusic would make the vast majority\nof bands sob into their hands. It\u2019s\nunbelievably complex, but it doesn\u2019t\nsound forced. The setlist was a great\ncombination of old and new. With\nlots of old favourites such as Ef and\nthe unbelievably dancey Infinite\nMirror mixed in with tracks off the\nmore electronic oriented new album\nInstallation, they really showcased\ntheir vast range of fantastic material.\nAn unexpected highlight was new\nalbum track Bond. Sounding like Toe\non speed, it completely blew me away.\nNow, due to the very nature of math\nrock, it is extremely difficult to dance\nto. At any moment they can change\ntime signature or tempo and throw\nyou completely off. To dance at a math\nrock gig, in front of fellow math rock\nafficionados, is therefore a huge risk.\nFrom the moment LITE hit the stage,\nnobody seemed to give a shit. There\nwas dancing all over the shop. I\u2019m\ntalking wall to wall dancing.\nEverything was running late, and\nthe venue was literally so hot there\nwas sweat dripping down the walls\n(I accidentally touched it at one\npoint and it was awful), and yet the\natmosphere was what I can only\ndescribe as jubilant. Having a crowd\nsinging along to a big chorus is\npretty standard, but when you\u2019ve got\nthem singing along to instrumental\nmath rock you\u2019re onto a winner. It\u2019s\nhard to describe what it is, but there\nis something just overwhelmingly\nhappy about LITE\u2019s music that really\nresonated with the crowd.\nIt was a really special show to have\nwitnessed. Everybody in the venue\nseemed to be ecstatic they were there.\nI definitely was.\nStuart Masson reviews a line up chocked full of math rock from home and abroad\n\n"

    "content": "14 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCommunist Manifesto: A History\nP\nre-History: The world that\nformed The Manifesto was\na world in the process of,\nto use Karl Polanyi\u2019s term,\na great transformation.\nThe American and French revolutions\nhad shown once and for all that the old\nabsolutist orders were anachronisms\nthat had somehow forgotten to\ndie; the industrial revolution had\nthoroughly transformed the basic\nmodes of capitalist production and\nwith them, the history of the future\nworld. The industrial revolution in\nturn transformed society: in 1770, the\nyear Wordsworth was born, London\u2019s\npopulation was still somewhat less\nthan 1 million people, but a year after\nWordsworth died in 1851, Britain\nhad an urban majority and London\na population of around 3 million.\nThe visibility of these demographic\ntransformations are reflected by the\npublication of Malthus\u2019 Essay on the\nPrinciple of Population in 1798 and\nthe start of modern census taking at\nthe turn of the century. Similarly the\nlandscape was becoming similarly\ndeformed, Blake\u2019s \u2018dark Satanic Mills\u2019\ndate to the opening decade of the 19th\ncentury. However, the fact that Blake\nfound the factories so remarkable\nshows how little developed\nindustrialism was; the mills would\nlose their chthonic terror in the wisps\nof a mid-century miasmic fog.\nIt was in these new industrial hellholes that socialist ideas were born: the\nfirst major Saint-Simonian journal was\nL\u2019Industrie, while Robert Owen spent\na spell as a Manchester mill manager.\nProudhon made careful use of the\nnew science of political economy in\norder to advocate his anarchism. Their\nmotivations were in differing degrees\ncompassion and self-righteous moral\nhorror at the sight of the collapse of\nsocial values that accompanied these\nrapid demographic changes.\nMeanwhile, the true socialist\nimpetus came from the gradual\ndevelopment of the working class\nand the growing consciousness\nthat something needed to be done.\nIt was mainly the artisanal sectors\nthat were interested in theoretical\nlucidity for their programmes which\nwere coming more and more to be\ncalled \u2018communism\u2019; the members\nof Communist League which\ncommissioned The Manifesto were\nmainly tailors and woodworkers.\nTotracetheintellectualdevelopment\nof The Manifesto, however, we must\nalso look to German philosophy.\nHegel, born like Wordsworth in 1770,\nwas the undisputed giant of German\nphilosophy. The relative sophistication\nof German philosophy compared to\nits French or British alternatives at\nthe time is probably a product of the\nweakness of the German bourgeoisie,\nforced to conduct a purely intellectual\nrevolt.\nThus, for the most part, the young\nHegelians levelled their criticisms at\norganised religion and other kosher\ntopics. Marx held these young\nHegelians and their idealism in some\ndisdain (see for instance the biting\nearly texts, The Holy Family and The\nGerman Ideology). However, possibly\nvia Feuerbach (it depends on the\nMarxist you ask: Terry Eagleton would\nsay yes, Luk\u00e0cs no), Marx developed\na materialist conception of history\nand the Hegelian dialectic which was\ncentral to the political program put\nThis was a change of world-historical\nimportance and has naturally been\nthe focus of much study. In the rest\nof Europe the development of the\nworking classes, and certainly of\nworking class consciousness, lagged\nsomewhat behind Britain.\nThe fact that there had been so\nmany reasons for the development\nof the Communist Manifesto, both\nsocial and intellectual, led some\ncritics to accuse Marx and Engels of\nunoriginality. This is a meaningless\naccusation in so far that if we are to\nsay that ideas have a sound basis\nin social situations, we are merely\nparroting a Marxist point. However\nin terms of theoretical rigour, sheer\nstyle and insight which is original in\nthat it revealed itself to no others,\nMarx (and to a lesser extent Engles)\nforth in The Manifesto.\nImportant as the academic heritages\nare, the real reason for the birth of\ncommunism, however, was the birth\nof a new class. To use EP Thompson\u2019s\nterm, the working class was \u2018made\u2019 in\nBritain between 1780 and, say, 1830 in\nthe first revolts where the proletariat\nexpressed a certain measure of class\nconsciousness.\nThe notorious maturity of the\nEnglish working class \u2013 mature\nbecause older; and older as England\nwas the first industrial country \u2013\nmeant that the Chartist revolt could\nbeaslargeandasnon-violentasitwas.\ndivergent German socialist parties,\nthere only being a German language\nedition. However, by 1851 Engels\ncould write that \u201cThe first act of\nthe revolutionary drama on the\ncontinent of Europe has closed\u201d\nand the continent of Europe settled\ndown to two incontinent decades of\neconomic growth. Unsurprisingly,\nThe Manifesto made little headway\nin this period, with no successful\ntranslations. This was alleviated a\nlittle by the foundation of the First\nInternational, the founding of the\ntwo German workers\u2019 parties which\nwere to become the SPD and Marx\u2019s\nnewfound notoriety as an eloquent\nand powerful defender of the Paris\nCommune in 1871.\nThe first big break for The Manifesto\ncamewiththetrialofAugustBebeland\nrelevant.\nFollowing the start of the \u2018Great\nDepression\u2019 in the mid-1870s and\nthe subsequent growth of the various\nEuropean workers parties, The\nManifesto\u2019s influence spread. This, it\nmust be said, was little aided by the\npublication of the first Volume of\nCapital in 1867: it was almost certainly\nvery little understood or even read by\nthe majority of the literate workers,\nso never mind the workers in general.\nHowever in countries such as\nEngland, where the workers\u2019 parties\nwere still of little threat, the text itself\nwas met with universal admiration by\nthose qualified to know and its general\ninfluence may have diffused down to\nthe lower ranks of the new Labour\nParty via its leaders. This was not to\nlast; Lloyd George, having studied\neconomics at Oxford, could boast at\nnever having read a line of Capital, but\nthen, Lloyd George had been forced to\ninstitute the outlines of a welfare-state\nsystem and so feelings towards Marx\nwere probably running a little higher.\nDespite this very real growth in\nspread and reach, The Manifesto\u2019s\nimpact before WWI was fairly limited.\nDespite the appearance of the new\nmass workers parties \u2013 by 1912 the\nSPD was the biggest party in Germany\nwith a million members on the eve\nof the war \u2013 there were somewhere\nin the region of 100 to 150 thousand\ncopies of The Manifesto printed in\nGermany between 1848 and 1918. It\nalso seems apparent that the working\nclass had not absorbed many of the\nideas in The Manifesto. Classics of\nworking-class literature such as The\nRagged Trousered Philanthropist\nshow just how limited the initial\nreach of Marxist ideas were amongst\nthe working classes, and even in\nintellectual radical sectors of the\nworking class, Darwinism was a more\nubiquitous intellectual preoccupation\nthan anti-capitalism. Socialism,\nhowever, had become a recognised\nforce and the name of Marx was also\nfamous.\nI will not write about the spread\nand growth nor the decline and fall\nof Marxism in the short twentieth\ncentury other than the very general\nremark that it cannot be understood\nwithoutacarefullookatthestateofthe\nUSSR and other countries around the\nworld. However, it must be mentioned\nthat nothing did so much to make\nMarx an intrinsic part of our collective\nculture as the initial existence in the\n20th century of the Soviet Union.\nMarxism became the hegemonic\nexpression of revolutionary left-wing\ndiscontent because of the Soviet\nUnion\u2019s economic and political\nsuccesses. Similarly, the decline came\nwith the growing realisation of its\neconomic and political failures. Moral\nconcern was of next to no importance\non either side.\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nis unsurpassed by any thinker of his\nage. It was the Communist Manifesto\nwhich was to first bring the attention\nof the world to Marxist doors. Within\nweeks of the Manifesto\u2019s publication\nthe Spectre that had been haunting\nEurope exploded in an inferno of\nsocial revolt, the fires of which spread\nthroughout the whole of Europe. The\nworking classes of Europe had been\ninflamed.\nPre-Soviet Influence\nFollowing the outbreak of the\n1848 revolutions, The Communist\nManifesto probably had a small but\nreal impact, amongst the variously\nWilhelm Liebknecht, the founders of\nthe SPD, as well as the lesser-known\nAdolf Hepner, a socialist journalist,\nfor treason in 1872. These three had\nbeen put on trial for objecting to the\nFranco-Prussian War and during the\nproceedings the prosecution read\nout the entire text of The Manifesto.\nThis was a rather remarkable event,\nbecause it led to the first large-print\nrun of The Manifesto, published\nlegally only because it was part of\ncourt-proceedings. The 1872 preface\nto the text is generally compiled with\nthe text and explains briefly which\nelements of the text are no longer\nzeno.org\n\n"

    "content": "31\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 28 FEB\nTELEVISION\nTasty treats and Norse heroes\nEmily Fulham on this week\u2019s return of two fan favourites\nHannibal\nO\nne of last year\u2019s\nsurprise breakout\nhits, Hannibal,\nreturns to NBC\non 28th February\n(unfortunately, no UK release date has\nbeen announced). After premiering\nto shaky viewing numbers and little\nmedia attention, the show turned out\nto be one of the best things on TV in\n2013, and has since built up a huge\nfanbase eager for its return. Added\nto this is the fact that the first series\nended in a seriously tense finale, with\nSpecial Agent Will Graham behind\nbars accused of the murders that\nHannibal committed, and you\u2019ve got\nall the ingredients for one of the most\nfeverishly anticipated returns to TV\nthis year.\nFrom what we\u2019ve seen and heard\nabout the second series, the tension\nisn\u2019t about to let up any time soon. In\na perfectly executed move to heighten\nanticipation, NBC released footage\nfrom a scene in the first episode featuring a knife fight between two of the\nmain characters. The trailer for the series also promises even more drama,\nas Hannibal is investigated following Will\u2019s arrest, while Will, hell-bent\non revenge against Hannibal, slowly\nstarts to regain his sanity.\nExpect to see several new characters\nas well, including Mason Verger, one\nof Hannibal\u2019s patients. Viewers of the\nHannibal film will recognise the name\nas the role played by Gary Oldman, after his relationship with Hannibal has\nended drastically badly. Some favourites from the minor characters will\nreturn too, such as Gillian Anderson\nas Bedelia du Maurier, Hannibal\u2019s psy-chotherapist, who surprisingly may\nturn out be the something of an ally to\nWill Graham.\nIf the first series is anything to go\nby, we can expect more stellar acting\nfrom Mads Mikkelson as everyone\u2019s\nfavourite cannibal, managing to strike\nthe perfect balance between menace\nand sophistication while making far\ntoo many puns about cannibalism for\nsuspicions not to arise. Hugh Dancy\nis also magnificent in his portrayal\nof Will Graham, whose slow spiral\ninto madness was the most gripping\nthing about the show. Now behind\nbars, Will\u2019s attempt to convince others\nof his innocence will depend on him\nkeeping a tight grip on his sanity and\na clear head to avoid succumbing to\nmore of Hannibal\u2019s manipulations.\nIt remains to be seen if the second\nseries will follow the more familiar\nkiller-of-the-week format that its first\nseries at least partially followed; one\nexpects this could get more complicated with an imprisoned main character,\nbut no doubt there\u2019ll still be plenty for\nFBI agent Jack Crawford and the rest\nof the team to do (figuring out that\nHannibal rhymes with cannibal would\nbe a good start).\nIn spite of the show being extremely\ndark, both the fans and the show runners seem to have a sense of humour.\nAfter fans started photoshopping\nflower crowns on pictures of the cast\nin an effort to lighten up the tension,\nactor Hugh Dancy gamely wore a\nflower crown of his own when appearing on a question and answer panel\nwith fans. More recently, it was announced that a range of merchandise\nis planned to be released in connection to the show, including, bizarrely\nenough, a selection of perfume (some\npossible scent ideas: blood, human\nflesh, the scent of neverending despair\nas one slowly goes insane?)\nThe only real complaint about the\nfirst series was that it took a few episodes to get into its stride, but from\nwhat we\u2019ve seen so far, that\u2019s a mistake\nthat seems to have been rectified this\ntime around. With another thirteen\nepisode season to look forward to,\nHannibal promises to be one of the\nTV highlights this spring.\nV\nikings was the History\nChannel\u2019s answer to\nGame of Thrones, with\na drastically smaller\nbudget and fewer\ndragons (OK, no dragons). It still\nhad its appeal though, telling the\nstory of a group of Viking warriors\u2019\nfirst raid across to England. The\nmain character, Ragnar Lothbrook,\nis a legendary character from Norse\ntales, famous for being the scourge\nof France and England. On his first\nraid to the monastery of Lindisfarne,\nRagnar brings back with him a monk,\nAthelstan, as a slave for him and his\nfamily, and much of the first series\nfollowed Athelstan\u2019s acclimatisation to\nthe unfamiliar environment of Viking\nlife.\nSeason two picks up a full four years\nafter the events of season one, which\nended with Ragnar\u2019s family torn\napart following his daughter\u2019s death,\nthe betrayal of his wife, and an alliance against his brother. Presumably,\nthe news that Ragnar\u2019s infidelity has\nresulted in his mistress\u2019s pregnancy\nwon\u2019t be going down well with his\nwife, Lagertha (and as a shieldmaiden,\nshe\u2019s definitely not a woman you want\nto get on the wrong side of). Travis\nFimmel, who plays Ragnar, is a relatively unknown actor who has proven\nhis merit in a weighty role. Occasionally reminiscent of a young Brad Pitt,\nit\u2019s likely that this could lead to big\nthings for the actor, who was also a\nhigh-profile model for Calvin Klein\nbefore taking the jump into acting.\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if\nRagnar\u2019s relationship with his brother\nRollo can ever be repaired, now that\nRollo has allied himself with Ragnar\u2019s\nrival, the warrior chieftain Jarl Borg.\nThere\u2019s also been some heavy hints\ndropped about Athelstan\u2019s journey in\nseries two. Actor George Blagden was\nquoted as saying that \u201cAthelstan goes\nthrough more change in one and a half\nseasons than Walter White does in\nfive,\u201d with the former monk making a\ntransition into full-blown warrior and\nlots of references to an as-of-yet unspecified \u2018dark turn\u2019 for the character\nin the first half of the series. Nonetheless, the monk\u2019s questioning of his re-Vikings\nligion will continue in the new series,\nas Athelstan struggles with his Christian faith and becomes immersed in\nthe rituals of Norse mythology.\nOne of the most spectactular things\nabout the show is its cinematography,\nand yet surprisingly the vast majority\nof outdoor locations were filmed in\nIreland (another way in which Vikings\nis hopping on the Game of Thrones\nbandwagon). Nonetheless, scenes of\nfjords, mountains, and longships battling across the ocean are stunning.\nFor a show that\u2019s broadcast on the\nHistory Channel, Vikings takes a lot of\nliberties with historical accuracy, but\nit\u2019s entertaining enough to be a minor\nconcern. There\u2019s enough blood and\ngore to appease any Game of Thrones\nfans, although notably fewer gratuitous sex scenes (which may be a good\nor bad thing, depending on your point\nof view). It may not be so grand in\nscope, but there\u2019s still plenty for fans\nto sink their teeth into.\nWith more battles, love triangles,\nand family tensions ahead, the second series looks set to hit the ground\nrunning. For anyone is looking to fill\nthe gap in epic fantasy drama, Vikings\nmight be an ideal choice.\n\n"

Our technology helps\nyou to book great cab deals for long\ndistance and local trips via our website\nand smartphone app. We\u2019re backed by\nO2, the mobile operator.\nCongratulations on your success on\nthe Dragons\u2019 Den TV show. What\nwas it actually like in the Den?\nThanks, the whole experience of\ngetting 3 investment offers from the\nDragons was a bit surreal. And it\u2019s\ngreat that minicabit\u2019s app is the first\napp to ever win offers in the Den!\nPitching in the Den itself was pretty\nmuch like any other meeting with\npotential investors, except everyone\nwas wearing TV makeup. The time in\nthe Den was a lot longer than shown,\nwhere they certainly grilled me. But\nthe negotiation was as tense as it\nappeared, as I had to carefully deal\nwith each of the Dragons\u2019 offers.\nOverall, it\u2019s a great thumbs up for\nthe business, especially coming after\nO2 had invested in us as a startup\n(through their Wayra fund).\nWhat did you study at Imperial\nCollege?\nI was a Chemistry with Management\nundergraduate in 1993 (and no, I don\u2019t\ndye my hair!). In fact, I was one of the\nfirst to take the undergrad course in\nManagement from the small house\nthey had across Exhibition Road. It\u2019s\ngreat to see how the Management\nSchool has expanded since then.\nHow did your time at Imperial\nshape your entrepreneurial career?\nI\u2019m really proud of my time at Imperial,\nand in fact my entrepreneurial roots\nwere planted then. In my very first\nFreshers week, I joined the committee\nof a brand new society which was\nquite focused on financial modelling\netc. Having managed its events, I\nbecame its Chairman in my 3rd year\nand totally repositioned it, rebranding\nit as The Finance Society, launching\nits London University-wide Capital\nmagazine and bringing in some big\nname event sponsors\u2026all in the\nmidst of a recession! I myself didn\u2019t\nhave a deep interest in banking, but it\ndeveloped my skills in marketing and\nalso managing a big team. It became\none of the biggest societies when I\nleft and I understand it\u2019s still around\ntoday.\nA key learning to any student at\nImperial today is get involved in an\nextra-curricular activity. Whatever\nthe society, club or project is, you\u2019ll\nnever have an opportunity to practice\nand learn what you\u2019re good or bad at,\nand the skills you pick up will serve\nyou in any commercial or academic\ncareer throughout your life.\nHow did your career evolve after\nuniversity?\nI switched between corporate\nmarketing roles and doing a startup\nin the late \u201890s, the latter with\nmixed success. I then spent 9 years\nin the mobile industry, working\nat O2 and then Vodafone Global,\nwhere I was responsible for their\nInternet Partnerships and Apps\nworldwide. Looking back, it was quite\nentrepreneurial as mobile internet\nwas just taking off and was a pretty\ndynamic environment to work in. I\nwas then itching to do a startup and\nso set up minicabit in the autumn of\n2010.\nAnd how is minicabit doing now?\nIt\u2019s been a long ride with the usual\nups and downs of a startup, but it\u2019s\ngoing great guns now! We\u2019ve got well\nover 300 licensed cab operators across\nthe UK on our network; Apple has\nhighlighted our app 6 times in their\nApp Store; and major venues around\nthe UK offer our service to their\ncustomers, including The O2 Arena,\nWembley Arena, Expedia, London\nCity Airport, and Blenheim Palace\namongst many others.\nWe pride ourselves in doing things\ndifferently from what one expects\nfrom the cab sector, and are always\ninnovating new ideas. For instance,\nuntil end of Sunday 2nd March, our\nTwitter page (@minicabit) is giving\naway 2 tickets to see Beyonce live at\nThe O2 Arena, with a cab ride to take\nyou there from anywhere in the UK\n(upto \u00a3200!).\nWhat\u2019s your advice to students\nconsidering doing or joining a\nstartup?\nThe startup scene has transformed\nsignificantly, particularly in the last 5\nyears. In my day, joining a corporate\nwould be the natural starting point for\na graduate to kickoff their career and\ngain valuable commercial expertise.\nNow, cutting edge experience\n(especially for online, mobile, tech) is\narguably to be found in startups, to the\npoint that corporates are increasingly\nlooking to partner with, or hire from,\nstartups as the digital revolution\ngathers pace. Also, the tools to startup\na business are cheaper, and the\nsupport network better than ever.\nSo now is a great time for startups,\nbut I caution to choose your venture\nwisely, and to be prepared for a lot\nof hard work in the face of almost\nconstant uncertainty.\nWould you hire an Imperial\ngraduate?\nMy team is made up of mostly fresh\ngraduates, as they typically have the\ntalent and energy my business needs.\nFunnily enough, I once tried hiring\nsummer interns from Imperial but\ngot zero response, probably because\nthey thought we were a minicab\nfirm! I ended up getting some great\ngrads from UCL, Manchester and\nBristol universities \u2013 the experience\nof working in a startup during a\nprime time BBC TV broadcast will no\ndoubt be added to their CV\u2019s. We\u2019ll\nbe looking to take on some summer\ninternships, so it would be nice to see\nsome applicants from Imperial this\ntime. We can give them a break from\ntheir science and engineering books!\nAmer Hasan is CEO of minicabit,\nwww.minicabit.com, @minicabit.\nThis week Nida Mahmud caught up with Amer Hasan, an Imperial Alumnus and CEO of minicabit. He recently appeared on Dragons\u2019 Den and recieved offers from three out of the five Dragons.\nFurthermore, minicabit is the first app to win an offer on the show. Minicabit is an app and website that enables users to compare real time quotes from cab companies. The company operates\nin over 30 cities and wil be expanding to even more in 2014. Amer tells us more about minicabit and how you can win tickets to see Beyonce at The O2.\n\n"

    "content": "32 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nCATNIP catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAsk Annie, your friendly Agony Aunt\nHelp! My parents told me last week\nthat they\u2019re getting divorced. I feel\nreally helpless because I can\u2019t go back\nhome to see them, and I\u2019m dreading\ngoing home for the holidays, because\neverything will be different. I feel really\nguilty that I can\u2019t be there for my\nparents, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d say\nto them anyway. What should I do?\nEnd of an Era in Embankment\nIt\u2019s always tough when your parents\nsplit up, but as a mature adult, you\nshould be able to see that if they\u2019ve\nmade this decision, it\u2019s probably for\nthe best. By making this decision\nwhen you\u2019re away, they\u2019re probably\ntrying to minimise any impact that\nthe practicalities of separating have\non you, you don\u2019t have to see it to the\nbitter end. While you might feel like\nyou need to support them, they\u2019ve\ndecided to do it this way, and you have\nto accept that if they need anything\nfrom you, they will ask for it. If you feel\nlike you need to talk to them about it\nthough, you need to bring it up with\nthem yourself.\nHelp! My lab partner has really bad\nBO. He\u2019s a really good lab partner\notherwise, but it makes working in a\nconfined area with him really difficult.\nHow can I gently suggest to him that\nhe needs to shower a little more often?\nNauseated in Neasden\nIf you had this problem, you\u2019d want\nto know about it, so it\u2019s good that\nyou want to say something to him.\nWhile he might not appreciate it\nso much at first, he will thank you\nfor it eventually. Try and make\nit seem like it\u2019s a new thing, like\nyou\u2019re mentioning it as soon as\nit\u2019s happened, to minimise his\nembarrassment. It\u2019s alright to play it\ndown, but don\u2019t make too much of a\njoke about it, or he might not realise\nthat you\u2019re being serious.\nHelp! I\u2019ve been using Tinder a lot\nlately, and I\u2019ve been talking to a guy\nwho wants to meet up. I really like him,\nbut I used a fake picture on my profile\nso I don\u2019t know how I can ever actually\nmeet him. What can I do?\nDeceitful in Denmark Hill\nIt depends how different the picture\nyou chose is. If you\u2019re a bit Ugly Betty\nand you\u2019ve chosen J.Lo, you might be\nable to get away with pretending that\nit\u2019s just exceptional lighting. If you\u2019ve\nchosen a photo of Paris Hilton, even a\nblonde dye job isn\u2019t going to make that\nconvincing. If you can get away with\nit, try sending him some pictures that\nare halfway between the fake one and\nyou, and then gradually change them\nto real pictures of you before you meet\nup. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s believable,\nyou can either confess and hope he\nlikes you enough to think it\u2019s funny, or\njust leave it, put a real photo on your\nTinder, and find someone else.\nHelp! My housemates have started\nplanning where they want to live next\nyear, and it\u2019s assumed that we\u2019ll live\ntogether next year, wherever we go.\nBut I\u2019m fed up of living with them, and\nwhile I\u2019m happy to put up with them\nuntil the end of the year, how do I tell\nthem that I don\u2019t want to live with\nthem next year?\nLeaving in Limehouse\nIt\u2019s important to let them know that\nyou don\u2019t want to live with them next\nyear before they make any serious\nplans. If you don\u2019t tell them, they\u2019ll\nonly find out through the grapevine\nfrom the other people you\u2019re planning\non living with. You don\u2019t have to tell\nthem that you don\u2019t like living with\nthem; pitch it as you really wanting to\nlive with the other people. If you let\nthem know now, they can\u2019t be angry\nthat you\u2019ve inconvenienced them, and\nit will be a much nicer atmosphere for\nthe remaining time than if they found\nout another way.\nHelp! I recently broke up with my long-term girlfriend, and we\u2019re trying to be\nfriends, but I\u2019m still wishing that we\nmight get back together. I want to move\non and try and meet someone else, but\nI\u2019m scared to do anything that might\njeopardise my chances of getting back\nwith my ex. What should I do?\nHopeful in Holburn\nAs I wrote last week, it\u2019s rarely a good\nidea to get back with an ex. Although\nit can be hard to completely let go of\nan old relationship and finally move\non, if you\u2019re starting to think about\nrelationships, you\u2019ve gone most of the\nway towards moving on. If you haven\u2019t\ngotten back together by this point,\nthe reasons that you broke up are\nvalid, and you probably won\u2019t. Bite the\nbullet and approach someone new,\nyou might be surprised how much\nbetter it\u2019ll make you feel.\n1. Do it face to face\nUnless you\u2019re in a different country, or want to just get it\nover with in the heat of the moment (because, for example,\nyou just found out that they were fucking your best friend),\nyou should always wait until you can meet face to face to\nbreak up with someone, out of respect for them, and your\nrelationship.\n2. Be honest\nThey\u2019ll want the chance to argue their case, but don\u2019t waver\nhere. Stay on task, and honestly explain to them why you\u2019re\nending the relationship. In order for them to get over it,\nthey will need to know why it\u2019s over, and you don\u2019t want to\nhave to explain this to them over and over again. By doing\nthis honestly the first time, you save yourself a lot of time\nand pain dragging things up time and time again.\n3. Stay friends\nAt least throughout the awkward division of assets, you\nshould try and remain friends. You\u2019ll find it really difficult\nto immediately cut off your dependence on them anyway,\nso for a while, you can try and gradually wean yourself off\nthem. It shows that you can be mature about it as well, so\nany petty hard feelings won\u2019t get aired in front of all your\nfriends.\n4. Ignore them (work the double peaks)\nOnce you\u2019ve got all the practicalities of the breakup out\nof the way, you need to take some time away from them.\nThis space will allow you to get over them and recover from\nthe relationship in your own time. Every time you speak\nto them, you\u2019ll set back the process of getting over them.\nEventually, you might be able to be friends with them, and\nyour level of contact can increase again. For now, you need\nto leave it be.\nAnnie\u2019s advice that\nImperial sorely needs\nHow to break up with someone\n(without being a dick about it)\nSend Annie your problems and suggestions at catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\ngony Aunt Annie\nWhiteley is the\nwoman who\nfought for women\u2019s\ncloakroom facilities\nat Imperial, and thus is qualified\nto solve all your problems.\nWhat\nimportant\nadvice\nshould\nAnnie\ndish out\nnext\nweek?\nEmail\nany ideas\nto the\naddress\nbelow!\nT\nhe V from our\nValentine\u2019s issue\nand the mystery\nrespondent are\nfinally going to go\non their date to see The\nLego Movie this weekend\n\u2013 hopefully I\u2019ll be able to\ntell you how it went next\nweek!\nD\nenizen of a certain\nlandlocked country\nvery much intrigued\nby romance.

    "content": "16 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMedics are On The Razzle!\nA\ncouple of weeks ago,\nthe producers of ICSM\nDrama\u2019s upcoming\nproduction, On the\nRazzle, sat down with\nthe cast and crew for a \u2018Hollywoodstyle interview\u2019 about the making of\nthe play. Not really knowing what a\n\u2018Hollywood-style interview\u2019 was, it\nquickly spiralled into a conversation\nabout life, the universe, and Asda.\nElvin: Director\nTommy, Ishani and Kanch: Producers\nChippy: Technical Director\nPeter: Artistic Director\nAbi: Costumes\nEveryone else: Cast\nElvin, tell us what this play is about.\nELVIN: I\u2019ve always described this\nplay as \u2018Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off in\n1900s Vienna.\u2019 I think that\u2019s quite\napt. It\u2019s about two shop assistants,\nChristopher and Weinberl, who take\nadvantage of their boss Zangler\u2019s\nabsence to escape to the big city\nfor one last adventure. Meanwhile,\nZangler\u2019s niece Marie decides to elope\nwith her lover Sonders, but they all\nend up crossing paths anyway. It\u2019s a\nclassic farce.\nHow are rehearsals going?\nELVIN: Rehearsals are good. I feel like\nwe\u2019ve been doing more than we have\nbefore. But it\u2019s an incredibly wordy\nplay, and there\u2019s a lot of dialogue to\nmemorise.\nRIJ: And there\u2019s a lot of wordplay in\nthe wordy play. [Groans all around]\nELVIN: I\u2019ve always believed that\nrepetition breeds familiarity, so really,\nwe just run through scenes over and\nover again in the hopes that some of\nthis dialogue will stick.\nSo, Rij, can you tell us a little bit\nabout what it\u2019s like to be the star of\nthe show during a fairly hectic term?\nRIJ: Busy. I\u2019ve had no time for\nanything else\u2026 I\u2019m kind of trying to\ndo medicine on the side a little bit, but\nit\u2019s been a struggle. No, it\u2019s been really\ngood though.\nActors, who is your acting\ninspiration?\nRIJ: Qamar.\nYATHU: Christian Bale.\nISHANI: I\u2019ll go for the slug woman in\nMonsters, Inc.\nJESAL: Heath Ledger and Gollum.\nGEN: My acting inspiration would be\nIshani.\nABI: I would have to go with Ishani as\nwell.\nTOMMY: Ralph Fiennes, because\nI was taught by the same guy who\ntaught him.\nABARIS: Schwarzenegger.\nRIJ: Actually, can I change mine to\nIshani?\nTommy, Gen, some of the scenes\nin this play could potentially be\nawkward. How have you dealt with\nthe scenes that might be out of your\ncomfort zone?\nTOMMY: What are you talking about?\nJESAL: Snogging!\nTOMMY: There\u2019s a lot of intimacy.\nELVIN: How do you approach it as an\nactor, because it must be challenging,\nright?\nTOMMY: You just talk it out\nbeforehand and set the ground rules:\nabsolutely no eye contact. My advice\nwould be to be very firm and proper\nin your approach. Don\u2019t look like you\nenjoy it.\nELVIN: I\u2019m feeling a little hot under\nthe collar.\nTOMMY: You don\u2019t want to give the\naudience the wrong impression. Make\nit very clear that there is a friend zone.\nI would like to point out that it does\ntake two to tango in this\u2026 relationship\ndynamic.\nGEN: I\u2019m just a very awkward person\nso I was very awkward when I was\napproaching it all, I remember. Now\nI\u2019m okay with it \u2013 I remember before I\nwas like, \u201cOh my God\u201d.\nChippy, what does Tech actually do?\nI\u2019ve been dying to find out.\nCHIPPY: So at the beginning of the\nterm, we sat down with Elvin and\ndiscussed what he wanted, how he\nwanted the stage to look. Then we\nworked out how to make it look like\nthat \u2013 what he wants on stage \u2013 with\nthe lights we\u2019ve got.\nSo what other challenges have you\nhad with tech so far?\nCHIPPY: This year has been very\ndifficult to get other people to help\nout.\nAnd if people are interested in\nhelping you, how do they go about\ndoing that?\nCHIPPY: They can e-mail me! At\nac3912. Or they can Facebook me. I\u2019m\nthe only Chippy.\nKanch, you are a producer. Tell us\nabout the producing experience.\nJESAL: Yeah, what does a producer\neven do?\nKANCH: Elvin gets the glory, and we\norder the T-shirts.\nELVIN: Can you try not to sound so\nresentful, please? But seriously, what\nmade you want to be a producer?\nBecause you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a very\nunglamorous role. People give you\nshit, constantly.\nISHANI: Well, it requires you to be\ninvolved, and to make things happen.\nAnd Kanch and I like to make things\nhappen.\nKANCH: We do. We\u2019re doers.\nISHANI: We\u2019re the dream team.\nNow, Tommy, you are the senior-most producer; you\u2019ve done this\nbefore. Ishani and Kanch are the\nrookies. What is the best advice\nyou would impart on someone who\nwants to be a producer?\nTOMMY: Just be ready to do anything\n(within boundaries). It\u2019s a very\nencompassing role. Be on the other\nend of the phone, be prompt with\ne-mails. These guys have been really\ngood. Having done it last year and this\nyear, it\u2019s been equally fun.\nISHANI: [looking over at Kanch] One\nthing to work on is spelling our names\ncorrectly in e-mails.\nPeter, what are the challenges of\nbeing Artistic Director?\nPETER: When I first saw the script,\nI thought uh-oh because I counted\nfive or six different scenes; interior,\nexterior, shop outside, shop inside, flat\ninside, flat garden, restaurant \u2013 all of\nwhich are completely different.\nISHANI: I do remember you telling\nme about this. You looked like you\nwere about to cry.\nPETER: Elvin wiped my tears. We\nhad to get a bit creative, but we\nbrainstormed ideas together. We sat\ndown, had a heart to heart \u2013 it was\nquite romantic\u2026 wait\u2026 where am I\ngoing with this?\nELVIN: It\u2019s a really ambitious set, with\na lot of moving parts.

We have tartan\ncloaks, which looks a bit like Red\nRiding Hood. Um\u2026 Costumes is fun?\nWe sit in Reynolds and sew.\nTOMMY: What do you do while\nyou\u2019re sewing?\nABI: We play music, and usually we\ngossip. It\u2019s really good fun.

It\u2019s the first time you go onstage\nand the first time anyone will watch\nwhat you\u2019ve been working on for\nmonths. It\u2019s terrifying but at the same\ntime it\u2019s really good.\nABS: I\u2019d say the last night, actually.\nYou get to have fun with it. You\u2019ve\nworked on it for months, trying to\nperfect it and then you get to release\nall the ideas you\u2019ve had about how to\nmake it funny.\nABI: I quite like the dress rehearsal,\nbecause having done the costumes it\u2019s\ngood to see that everyone has one. No\none has to be onstage naked, which is\nalways good to see.\nELVIN: I like the \u2018move in weekend\u2019\n\u2013 can I say that? It\u2019s when everyone\ncomes together for the first time.

That makes it easy to categorise you.\nLet me explain.\nThere are three types of maths students: the geeks, the party animals and the Asians. Stereotypical, but true.\nAll of them have held me at some point. The Asians treat me well, keeping me clean, while the party animals\ntoss me into the depths of their bag where I\u2019m surrounded by a terrible stench.

Fresh faces, bright with potential, at\nhome between my stacks. Dark follows fast on the heels of the day,\nheralding the feast ahead. Daily sacrifice is inevitable and all I must\ndo is wait.

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe naked truth about art history\nI\nn the retrospective for legendary\nBritish artist Richard Hamilton,\ncurrently running across both the\nTate Modern and the ICA, we have\nthe opportunity to see the piece\nhe was working on before his death\nin 2011. Le Chef-d\u2019oeuvre Inconnu,\ninspired by a Balzac story, shows\nthree masters of European painting,\nPoussin, Titian, and Courbet, studying\na computer enhanced reclining nude.\nIn a way, this piece neatly links a theme\nthat has been running throughout\nart history \u2013 that of the female nude\n\u2013 tracing it from the days of Titian,\nthrough five centuries, to the current\nworld of Photoshop and advertising.\nHowever, the legacy of the female\nnude goes even further back; along\nwith the landscape and the still life, the\nfigurative nude forms one of the key\ncornerstones of the artistic canon.\nThe first known examples of the\nfemale nude can be traced back to\nthe Venus Figurines \u2013 prehistoric\ndepictions of women with exaggerated\nproportions, thought to represent\nfertility goddesses. The oldest of these,\nthe Venus of Hohle-Fels, dates back to\nover 35,000 years ago. This theme then\nran through Greek statuary, forming\nthe concept of the classical nude, which\nwas to be referenced by artists for the\nnexttwomillennia.TheseGreekstatues\nwere used to decorate temples, and\nincluded representations of gods such\nas Aphrodite and Apollo, who were\nthought to be perfect representations\nof physical form.\nWhile the taste for the classical nude\nhas declined somewhat in the Modern\nEra, it is still a theme that greatly\ninfluences the art produced today. But\nwhat kind of message do these works\nconvey? Are they celebrations of the\nfemale form, or just another means by\nwhich society objectifies and exploits\nwomen?\nIf we are to take the idea of\n\u2018Objectification\u2019 literally, then it is easy\nto argue that all figurative art is a form\nof objectification; when an artist paints,\nsculpts, or prints an image of a person,\nthey are essentially transforming that\nperson\u2019s image into a physical object,\nbe it a canvas or a statue. Therefore,\nit could be said, that this process of\nobjectification is gender neutral; when\na person is represented in art, they are\nalways objectified, whether they are\nmale or female.\nHowever, this argument ignores\nthe proportion of male to female\nnudes. While male nudes may be\ncommonplace in galleries, they are\nswamped by their female counterparts.\nThe \u2018Guerilla Girls\u2019, a group of feminist\nactivists who address sexism in the\narts, demonstrate this idea succinctly\nwith their poster Do Women have to\nbe Naked to get into the Met. Museum?,\nwhich states that \u201885% of the nudes [in\nthe Metropolitan Museum] are female\u2019.\nWith such a disparity it is easy to see\nthat the balance of power is shifted far\ntowards the men of the art world.\nThis isn\u2019t such a surprise; after all,\nthe \u2018Male Gaze\u2019, described by feminist\ntheorist Laura Mulvey, is imposed\nupon the art world by the largely\nheterosexual, white men who control a\nlarge proportion of the industry.\nAnother issue with the comparison\nbetween male and female nudes is\nthe method of presentation; while\nthe male nudes of classical antiquity\nshow muscular olympians, standing\ntall and proud, the female statuary is\ngenerally soft, rounded, and inherently\n\u2018feminine\u2019, promoting the female \u2018ideals\u2019\nof grace and beauty. This disparity has\nhelped to form the societal pressures\nput upon women to look good for men,\nand promoted the idea of the \u2018ideal\nfemale beauty\u2019.\nThis view is represented in Titian\u2019s\nstunning work Venus of Urbino (1583),\nwhich shows the ideal reclining nude;\ngazing into the viewer, with a hand\nplaced gently over her genitals, this\nVenus is the paragon of female softness\nand sensuality. Even painters who\nespoused this societal ideal of beauty,\nsuch as Peter Paul Rubens, whose\nvoluptuous nudes inspired the word\n\u2018Rubenesque\u2019, still imposed their ideas\nof ideal beauty upon the female form,\nmaking women little more than objects\nof desire.\nThis idea of the nude objectifying\nwomen is complicated by the uneasy\nrelationship between the Church\nand the European art world during\nthe Middle Ages, where nudity was\ndiscouraged. The only depictions of\nnudity that weren\u2019t frowned upon\nwere where the element was necessary,\nsuch as in biblical stories; if one wants\nto find examples of nudes from this\nperiod, one needs look no further that\nthe vast wealth of depictions of \u2018The\nFall\u2019 painted by European painters.\nWhile this theme of patriarchal religion\nsuppressing the very idea of female\nsexuality is a familiar one, the argument\nthat artists who painted female nudes\nwere, in some way, \u2018rebelling\u2019 against\nthe oppression of women is laughable.\nRather than being a celebration of\nfemale sexual independence, on the\nwhole nudes contain strong elements\nof erotica, and are vastly an exaltation\nof male sexual desire.\nThis inherent erotica can be found\nin a number of female nudes, an idea\nsupported by art critic John Berger,\nwho states that female nudes reflect\nthe \u2018prevailing power relationship\nbetween females portrayed in art and\nthe predominantly male audience\u2019\n.\nSome works featuring female nudes\nare so dehumanising that they almost\nbecome a self-parody; an example\ncan be seen in Courbet\u2019s L\u2019Origine\ndu Monde, which is quite simply an\nextreme close up of female genitals;\nwe do not see the woman\u2019s face, her\narms and legs are outside of the frame;\nshe is no longer human. Still, this does\nnot go as far as the work by British\nsculptor Allen Jones, who quite literally\ntransforms women into objects, such\nas tables and chairs.\nEven artists who present women in a\nway that is less obviously objectifying\nimbue their subjects with heavy doses\nof erotica. Degas\u2019 nudes are often\npainted performing routine activities,\nsuch as washing; \u2018they are nude\u2019\n,\nDegas seems to state, \u2018because they\nare bathing, it is completely normal\u2019\n.\nHowever, these works are still highly\nerotic, and place the viewer into the\nrole of voyeur, which in some ways is\na more insidious representation of the\npower imbalance. And nudes need\nnot be beautiful in order to be erotic\nor objectifying; the work of Schiele is\ngrotesque, showing emaciated, twisted\nforms. But instead of being horrifying\n\u2013 and perhaps this is a mark of Schiele\u2019s\ngenius \u2013 the paintings seem very\nsexually charged, conveying an idea of\nsyphilitic sexuality \u2013 love in the time of\ncholera, if you will.\nFred Fyles investigates the depiction the female nude in art\nthroughout history, and asks, is it exploitative?\nThroughout the history of art there\nhave been a number of artists who have\nsought to challenge the idea of what a\nnude should be. Two examples would\nbe Manet\u2019s Olympia, and Picasso\u2019s Les\nDemoiselles D\u2019Avignon, both female\nnudes that caused a shock when they\nwere exhibited; while the controversy\ncan be attributed in some part to\nthe painting style \u2013 more so for the\nPicasso \u2013 a large amount came from\nthe fact that the women portrayed\nwere prostitutes. This idea, of society\nshaming female sexuality, slots in\nnicely between religious oppression\nof women and objectification of the\nfemale form in the foundation of our\npatriarchal society. A counterargument\ncould be made for the paintings of\nthe late Francis Bacon, whose nude\nstudies of both men and women were\nnaturalistic to the point of grotesque;\nhowever, this is still an example of\nBacon using the female form as an\nobject with which he makes a point on\nthe nature of beauty.\nWhile some of the language I have\nused in this article may seem strong, I\ndon\u2019t want this to be seen as a polemic\nagainst the female nude. I believe that\nmost of the works mentioned, although\nthey contribute to the debasement of\nwomeninsociety,arehugelyinfluential,\nand incredibly moving masterpieces. I\ndo not believe that people need to stop\nviewing such works, but perhaps you\nshould take a bit of time to explore the\nwork of female artists who are in charge\nof their own image, such as Pipilotti\nRist, Yoko Ono, and Nan Goldin. All\nthat I ask is that people approach the\nart that they view with a bit more\nnuance; \u2018Art for Art\u2019s Sake\u2019 is all well\nand fine, but the works artists produce\ncannot be separated from the society in\nwhich they were made any more than\nthey can be removed from the medium\nwith which they\u2019re formed. That\u2019s the\nnaked truth.\nRichard Hamilton, Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu 1, 2011 \u00a9 The Estate of Richard Hamilton\nEdouard Manet, Olympia, 1863\n\n"

This meant that what should have\nbeen a standard league game was filled\nwith rivalry, intensity and a little bit of\nviolence from the very first minute.\nAfter only 46 seconds, the Devils\nfound themselves shorthanded as\nAmerican centre Gordo Weigers was\nsent to the penalty box for slashing.\nUndeterred, the scoring was opened\nafter only 4 minutes by Imperial forward Gus Zimmerman, slotting a\nsharp angle shot through the netminder\u2019s legs. Not to be put down\nlightly, the Yetis fought back aggressively \u2013 scoring 2 goals before the end\nof the first period and taking 3 separate penalties for unnecessary contact.\nWith Oli Clipsham of the Devils sent\nto the penalty box early in the second\nperiod, Imperial had to work hard not\nto let UCL capitalise on their man ad-vantage. Spurred on by the high stakes\nand the abundance of adrenaline flow-ing, tempers overflowed as Max Fink\ntook down the captain of the Yetis in\nfront of the Imperial net. The resulting fight included 3 members of each\nteam, who were too riled up to bother\nremoving helmets before throwing\npunches. Surprisingly, the referee only\nsent 2 members of each team to the\npenalty box, allowing the instigators\nof the fight to continue unaffected.\nWith both teams having returned to\nfull strength, the Yetis managed to put\nthemselves 3-1 into the lead before a\nlast gasp defensive effort led to Zimmerman taking a penalty for checking\n(look it up on YouTube, it\u2019s the best bit\nof the sport) a player who did not have\nthe puck. Whilst Zimmerman was\nserving his time, Weigers broke past\nthe fragile UCL defence to power a\nslapshot past a hapless Yeti netminder.\nThis brought the score to 3-2 in UCL\u2019s\nfavour towards the end of the second\nperiod.\nComedy was provided throughout\nthe game in the form of delayed restarts as UCL seemed to frequently\nsend fewer players onto the ice than\nthey needed. However, the lack of a\nplayer with any discernable arithmetic\nability eventually put them at a disadvantage as they took two separate\npenalties for having too many men\non the ice. This allowed Imperial to\nput on the pressure throughout the\nthird period, where they enjoyed the\nmajority of possession and managed\nto outshoot the Yetis. UCL were only\nrescued in the dying minutes of the\nmatch as Imperial winger Matthew\nChoy rang a shot off the goal post. The\ngame ended 3-2.\nWith the teams now focusing all of\ntheir efforts on the London Ice Varsity,\nthe memory of such a close game will\nsurely serve to spur them on. If the\nDevils play to the level they showed\nin the final period and continue to\nmatch (if not, better) the intensity and\naggression of their rivals, the glory is\ntheirs for the taking. The London Ice\nVarsity is beginning to heat up, you\ndon\u2019t want to miss it!\nThe London Ice Varsity takes\nplace tonight at 7:30pm. Tickets are\nstill available at tinyurl.com/lon-donvarsity\nINSIDE\nIC take positives from difficult Kendo meet\nIC ICE HOCKEY\nAfter a host of matches being\nrescheduled due to the unrelenting\nwet weather, ICUWRFC were glad\nto be out on the pitch again. The\nteam had a strong set of backs who\nwould later make their presence\nfelt by GKT (Guy\u2019s, King\u2019s and\nSt. Thomas\u2019), whilst the forwards\nwelcomed Tessa Davey \u201cJone\u2019s\nLocker\u201d and Aamna Mohdin who\nmade their first appearances in the\nforward pack.\nGKT did not collect the first\nkick off cleanly and IC moved\nswiftly over the loose ball to secure\na turnover. Several phases of\nforward play combined with good\npassing in the backs to brought IC\nup the pitch. GKT responded well\nto defend their try line and stop\nthe forwards opening the score\nbut the sustained pressure in GKT\nterritory eventually led to a break\nwhen the backs combined well to\nsend Sam Gottarrdi over for the\nopening try.\nIC put boot to ball with great\neffect to get behind GKT\u2019s defence.\nThe opposition full back had a\nbusy day, having to make many\nnumerous cover tackles to prevent\nthe score line growing even wider.\nBut support across the IC players\nmeant that there was always a\nteammate close behind to secure\npossession or receive an quick\npop pass. This allowed the team to\nliterally run away with the play and\ncrafty footwork from Sam Gottardi\nand player of the match Heather\nGrant led to several more tries.\nReceiving the kick off, Charlie\nStephens and Lana Lee always\nseemed to be on hand forcing GKT\ninto making hard tackles. Forwards\ntook the ball in and offloaded\nbrilliantly around the breakdown.\nFly half Yas Edwards also went\ncrashing in to send a bunched\nGKT defense into disarray which\nthe backs took full advantage of. In\nfact, this combination would prove\nso successful especially in the latter\nhalf when successive restarts from\nGKT lead to very similar tries in\nquick succession.\nTries were conceeded late in each\nhalf which saw GKT\u2019s forwards take\nthe ball into contact and edged to\nthe try line. Line speed in defence is\nsomething IC will want to go away\nand work on. Nonetheless it was an\nincredible team performance from\nIC to win convincingly with the\nfinal score at 72-10.\nKatherine Fok\nIC Women\u2019s Rugby\nOli Clipsham\nImperial Devils\nImperial\u2019s 1st XI slot\nthree past Royal\nHolloway\nOn Saturday 15th February 2014,\nICUAFC 1s made the well known\ntrip to Harlington to face Royal\nHolloway 1s. In goal ICUAFC\nmade an emergency loan signing of\ntheir former goalkeeper, and 2012-2013 Player of the Year (although\nhe hates talking about it because\nit\u2019s really embarrassing) Henry\nGarner. His presence perked up\nthe likes of Amjad and Nielsen\nwho commented how their lives\nhad lost some meaning since\nhis departure from the team. In\nthis way, a (Biology) father was\nreturned with a son, much like\nOdysseus and Telemachus upon\ntheir reuniting at Ithica, as Alex\nDale gratefully clutched Garner\nto his bosom murmuring \u2018I knew\nyou\u2019d return father\u2019.\nAfter this rather surreal and\nlargely exaggerated turn of events\nthe team warmed up in good\nspirits, relieved that the previous\nnight\u2019s ritualistic lamb slaughter\nhad brought some respite from\nthe recent torrential downpours.\nThe match started brightly and\nHolloway found themselves behind\nafter only 1 minute as a defender\nhandled the ball, with his hand, and\nRobinson dispatched the penalty\nwith aplomb, sending the keeper\nthe wrong way in the process.\nImperial, like so many champions,\nwere winning without playing\nparticularly well.\nThe mentally challenged offender\ncouldn\u2019t help but continuously\nshout at Captain Robinson calling\nhim a \u2018f**king idiot\u2019 for thinking\nthat the handball in the box was,\nin fact, a handball in the box, but\nthese were met with an immediate\nretaliation of \u2018No mate, you are\nthe f**king idiot for giving away\na penalty in the first minute\u2019, to\nwhich silence quickly followed.\nNo more than 10 minutes later\nImperial had scored again. Winger\nDale, who had already skinned his\nopposition fullback alive multiple\ntimes, broke down the wing and\nsent in a high loopy cross which\nwas held up in the gale force winds.\nAbout 35 seconds later, it returned\nto Earth, and Captain Robinson\nwas there waiting for it, having\nphysically held of the Centre Back\nfor the aforementioned 35 seconds,\nand duly finished it off with a first\ntime volley. 2-0.\nHolloway had several chances\nto pull a goal back but Holloway\u2019s\nstriker, the aptly named Torres,\nHenry Garner\nICUAFC\nwas having no luck. At this point it\nwould be easy to make a joke about\nhow he was worse than Chelsea FC\u2019s\nvery own Fernando Torres, but that\nwould be too easy. I will instead take\nthe moral high ground and say that\non a good day he could be considered\nequal with Emile Heskey. At one\npoint another Holloway striker\nmanaged to beat the offside trap but\nwas only able to shoot straight at\nICUAFC\u2019s very own Petr Cech.\nAfterasternteamtalkfromCaptain\nRobinson, the players resumed the\nsecond half endeavouring not only to\nwin but to win well; Barcelona rather\nthan Stoke City. Imperial dominated\nproceedings despite heading into\nthe wind although Holloway were\nadamant they should have had\na penalty after left back Nugent\nhandled the ball with his face. I\u2019ll\nlet you work out why it wasn\u2019t given\nand why contrary to Holloway\u2019s\nappeals, it was not \u2018exactly the same\u2019\nas their hand ball. Shortly after this,\nCherif, clearly still in the Valentine\u2019s\nDay mood, fired a delightful cross\nfield through ball over the top of\nHolloway\u2019s defence, like Cupid\nloosing an arrow from his quiver,\nwhich found Dale, who full of love in\nhis heart, tenderly invited the keeper\nout of his box for a candle lit dinner,\nbefore lobbing him with no remorse.\nHolloway were in fact to get on\nthe score sheet when a through ball\nevaded the defence and the last ditch\nattempt of Amjad (maybe he should\ntry and shift up a gear just once in his\nlife) and found the striker (it wasn\u2019t\nTorres, he had been taken off by this\npoint for \u2018footballing reasons\u2019) who\nfound the bottom corner. However,\nthe goal would prove only a holloway consolation for the visiting side.\nImperial comfortably managed to\nhold out for the 3-1 win, without\nreally getting out of Omar Amjad\u2019s\nworld renowned first gear.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\n\n"

High profile\nAustralian healthcare administrator\nDr Tracey Batten will take up\nthe position at the start of April.\nThis follows the resignation last\nOctober of Mark Davies, who was\nwidely credited with making large\nimprovements to the Trust\u2019s financial\nsituation. The post of interim Chief\nExecutive has since been jointly held\nby former medical director Professor\nNick Cheshire and former chief\nfinancial officer Bill Shields.\nDr Batten attained a medical\ndoctorate from the University\nof Melbourne. She practiced\nmedicine at both the Aberdeen\nRoyal Infirmary and Bart\u2019s Hospital\nLondon. She later gained Master\u2019s\ndegrees in Healthcare Management\nand Business Administration from\nthe University of New South Wales\nand Harvard.

Her latest position\nwas Chief Executive of St Vincent\u2019s\nHealth Australia. With some 16,000\nstaff and a budget of \u00a31 billion, it is\nthe largest non-for-profit healthcare\nand research organisation in the\ncountry. A recent survey showed\nthat, during her tenure, over two\nthirds of St Vincent\u2019s staff agreed that\nit was \u201ca truly great place to work\u201d.\nSir Richard Sykes, chairman of\nthe Trust, said that the Trust had\n\u201cconducted an exhaustive, global\nsearch for our new chief executive\u201d\nand that he was confident that it\nhad \u201cfound the kind of aspirational\nand inspirational leader we were\nlooking for\u201d.

This will give it autonomy\nfrom the Department of Health,\ngiving members of the Trust greater\nfreedom in determining its policy.\nDr Batten indicated that she was up\nto the new job, saying: \u201cThe prospect\nof leading one of England\u2019s largest\nand most prestigious NHS Trusts\nis both an honour and an exciting\nchallenge. I hope to bring fresh\nideas from another public health\nsystem and to help Imperial College\nHealthcare NHS Trust complete its\njourney towards Foundation Trust\nstatus.

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 28 FEB\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLars von Trier: Dan\nNymph()maniac\nParts I + II\nDirector: Lars von Trier\nWriter: Lars von Trier\nStarring: Charlotte Gainsbourg, Shia\nLaBeouf, Uma Thurman, Jamie Bell\nRuntime: 241 minutes\nCertification: 18\nFred Fyles\nTreasured Writer\nNymphomaniac, the latest offering\nfrom Danish enfant terrible Lars von\nTrier, touched down in London last\nSaturday with a special \u2018One-Night\nStand\u2019 screening of both Parts I and\nII. The film has left a trail of carefully\nplanned controversy in its wake; still\nsmarting from his 2011 Cannes con-troversy, in which he mentioned that\nhe had sympathies with Hitler, von\nTrier took a \u2018Vow of Silence\u2019 with\nregards to the media, appearing in\npromotional material with duct-tape\nover his mouth. Those who were worried that this meant that the director\u2019s\ntrademark mischievous nature would\nnot extend to the marketing of the film\nneedn\u2019t have worried (after all, this is a\nman who had FUCK tattooed on his\nknuckles several decades after exiting adolescence): in the run-up to the\nrelease we have been witness to the\ndevelopment of the double bracket ()\nlogo, entertained with the idea of a\n\u2018softcore\u2019 and \u2018hardcore\u2019 version, and\nseen the orgasm faces of Charlotte\nGainsbourg, Shia LaBeouf, and Uma\nThurman, among others. But for all\nthese cheeky, flirty adverts dreamed\nup by ad-men, what von Trier actually\npresents is one of the least-sexy, frankly off-putting films in recent years; it is\nabout as erotic as sandpapering walls.\nThe introduction to the film is uncharacteristically understated, beginning with a blank screen and the\nsound of water trickling. Are we in\na von Trier film? After all, he began\nhis last film Melancholia with images\nof the end of the world, and the one\nbefore that \u2013 the incredibly controversial Antichrist \u2013 with a slow motion sequence in which a couple have\nunsimulated sex while their infant son\nfalls to his death. This uncertainty\nlasts all of three minutes, until we see\nJoe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), lying face\ndown in the snow with blood trickling\ndown her face, and the heavy chords\nof Rammstein seem to scream: \u2018Yeah.\nThis is the right film\u2019.\nWhat follows is a four-hour epic, in\nwhich Joe is discovered by an Seligman, an elderly amiable gentleman\nplayed by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd; after being warned by Joe to not phone an\nambulance \u2013 or even worse, the police\n\u2013 he can do little more than invite her\nin for a cup of tea. Caught off-guard by\nhis gentle demeanor, Joe lets her guard\ndown, and begins to tell him the story\nof her life \u2013 a life as a nymphomaniac.\nCharting a course from her first or-gasm, which occurred spontaneously,\naccompanied with a vision of the\nWhore of Babylon, through the loss\nof her virginity, and finally to the destruction of everything she ever held\ndear in the pursuit of an insatiable sex-drive, Joe and Seligman build up one\nof the oddest odd-couple relationships\nseen on screen.\nSeligman, an asexual academic,\nseemingly has little interest in the\nminutiae of Joe\u2019s sexual conquests, instead interrupting her with completely random observations; after telling\nhim how she lost her virginity \u2013 three\nthrusts from the front, then five from\nbehind \u2013 he exclaims \u201cthree and five,\nthose are Fibonacci numbers!\u201d These\ninterludes continue throughout the\nfilm, covering topics as diverse as\nfly-fishing and Bach\u2019s musical struc-tures, as Joe becomes more and more\nincredulous, at one point telling him\n\u201cthat was your weakest digression\nyet\u201d; while these odd interludes may\nsound grating on paper, in actual fact\nthey act as welcome relief from the\nunrelentingly bleak nature of Joe\u2019s sto-ry, which is split into eight chapters.\nThis narrative structure and breakdown of the fourth wall help confirm\nvon Trier as a master of metafilm,\nsomething which is reinforced by\nthe location of the film; shot in Belgium and Germany, the action takes\nplace exclusively in \u2018Lars-land\u2019, a surreal amalgamation of Northern European states where people use pound\nnotes, live in Scandinavian houses,\nand speak in a strained range of accents \u2013 the most notable of which is\nShia LaBeouf\u2019s, which ends up sounding like Dick van Dyke directed by\nJane Campion. These factors serve to\nsever the tethers the film has to the\nreal world, giving it a kind of surreal\nquality; while not quite a nightmare, it\nis certainly a fever-dream, coated in a\nmalarial sheen.\nThe production is, quite literally,\na film of two halves, split in twain to\navoid a bloated 4-hour mess. While\nthis makes sense when watching the\nfilms separately, when one sees the\nfilm as a whole it is easy to see where\nit peaks, and where is falls down. Part\nI is lighter, more energetic, and, sur-prisingly, genuinely funny; it\u2019s not\nthe usual kind of humour that von\nTrier uses, which mainly comprises of\nshock tactics that amount to a visual\n\u2018fuck you\u2019, but instead is naturally witty\nand tongue-in-cheek. Newcomer Stacy Martin gives a solid performance as\nYoung Joe, conveying a sense of unemotional numbness emphasised by\nlaconic body language, while LaBeouf\ngives a quite frankly bizarre performance as Jer\u00f4me, Joe\u2019s first love. In\nany other film LaBeouf\u2019s dodgy accent\nand constantly pained face would be\nutterly jarring, but in Nymphomaniac there is so much going on that\nthis seems to be completely normal.\nHowever, the standout performance\nin the first half, and indeed the entire\nfilm, is Uma Thurman, who plays a\njilted wife with a hysterical politeness,\nasking Young Joe whether she could\n\u201cshow the children the Whoring Bed.\u201d\nWhile Thurman is only on screen for\nabout ten minutes, it is this scene that\nremains in my mind long after the film\nis over.\nAs we move onto Part II things take\na left-turn, into much darker territory\nfamiliar to those who have seen Antichrist. Joe (now played in flashbacks\nby Gainsbourg) begins lesions with\na sadist called K, who is played with\na fearsomely cold brutality by Jamie\nBell; christened Fido, Joe is subject to\nskin-breaking whippings, humiliation,\nand beatings with coin-filled gloves.\nThroughout the film we are subjected\nto such explicit imagery that by about\nan hour in footage of unsimulated sex\nfails to even stimulate a gasp, but I\nfound the scenes with K actually very\ndifficult to watch, showing that von\nTrier is still able to shock. The film\nnever quite becomes this dark after\nthe exit of K, but also never gets back\nthe same energy; the second half feels\nmore sluggish, and the direction von\nTrier seems to be taking us becomes\nunclear. A surprise ending is enough\nto spice up the final five minutes, but\nit is difficult to make up for the hour\nthat precedes it.\nIt is an oft-quoted claim that every\ncharacter in a von Trier film is some\nfacet of Lars\u2019 personality; with any\nother director this might seem far-fetched, but von Trier seems to be able\nto contain both the geeky innocence\nof Seligman and the proudly sexual\nnature of Joe simultaneously. So what\nis he trying to say with this film? Towards the end he (somewhat need-lessly) spells out the \u2018message\u2019 behind\nhis film; Joe\u2019s behaviour is condemned\nbecause she is a woman, and it is the\nmisogynistic world that has brought\nabout Joe\u2019s downfall. While this seems\nto make the film some kind of feminist manifesto, it doesn\u2019t quite seem\nto ring true; Joe\u2019s refusal to describe\nherself as a \u2018sex addict\u2019, instead choosing the term Nymphomaniac with\npride, plays into what, to me at least,\ncan only be seen as a male fantasy, and\nseems to limit the power of the film.\nAs a work of art, Nymphomaniac is incredibly well done, combining striking\nimages with controversial topics, and\na heavy dose of genuine humour that\nmore than makes up for its occasional\ndips in quality. But as a manifesto, it\nseems contradictory, unaccessible,\nand downright bizarre \u2013 perhaps a bit\nlike Lars von Trier himself.\n\n"

The group\ncontinues to showcase best practice\nin combining the knowledge and\nskills of students from departments\nsuch as engineering, computing and\nthe business school, and consistently\ndelivers stellar consulting projects\nto a range of clients. Having worked\nwith ICG on projects ranging from\nglobal automotive manufacturers\nthrough to world-leading technology\norganisations such as Inmarsat, I can\nhonestly say that ICG produce project\ndeliverables which are of equal value\nto those of top consulting firms.\nJoining ICG is a must for any Imperial\nstudent interested in a fast-paced\ncareer in consulting.\u201d\nICG has worked with eight\ndifferent clients so far and has\nmany more projects in the pipeline.\nWhile operations and strategy work\nis preferred, the key criterion of\nselecting projects is whether the work\nwill be interesting and valuable for the\nparticipating students. As each project\nis concluded, the recommendations\nput forward by the teams has made a\nreal impact on the way clients do their\nbusiness, which is very rewarding to\nbe a part of.\nExamples of projects\nIEE\nIEE is a global leader in automotive\nsafety, employing 1,600 and having\nrevenues of \u20ac160m. It had recently\nbeen acquired by a set of international\ninvestment groups, opening up\nthe opportunity for IEE to redefine\nthemselves and expand the business.\nThe team from ICG were asked to\nassess the current market position of\nIEE and suggest how it could continue\ngrowing in a 10-year time frame. This\nincluded exploring new markets for\nIEE to address.\nThe ICG team formulated four\nWassif Shabbir\nPresidentImperial Consulting Group, under\nIC Consultancy Society\nhypotheses for what markets IEE\nshould be present in a decade from\nnow. This involved a thorough survey\nof the automotive sensors market,\nexposing gaps that IEE are suited\nto address, as well as attractive\nmarkets for diversification. Apart\nfrom exploring specific markets the\nteam assessed the impact of larger\nindustrial trends (such as the arrival\nof semi-autonomous vehicles) and\nthe opportunities and threats that it\npresented to IEE. The team also made\na recommendation on the balance\nthe business needs to strike between\ntheir focus on automotive and non-automotive markets. The work and\nrecommendations were presented\nto senior management at the IEE\nheadquarters in Luxembourg. Many\nof the recommendations have since\nbeen pursued.\nBBOXX\nBBOXX is a for-profit spin-off from\na student-led charity at Imperial called\ne.quinox. The focus of e.quinox is\nto design and construct solar kiosks\nin rural communities throughout\nAfrica. BBOXX aims to expand on\nthis mission by developing innovative\nmethods of distributing renewable\nenergy (i.e. portable solar products)\nto the bottom of the pyramid in\ndeveloping countries and is aiming\nto deliver electricity to 20 million\npeople by 2020. The consumer-base\nof BBOXX is predominantly in Africa\nand manufacturing is based in China.\nWith a franchise network covering 14\ncountries (increasing to 20 countries\nby 2014), ICG was asked to explore\nsuitable locations from where BBOXX\ncould operate from in the future.\nThe ICG team identified 17 potential\nlocations to investigate based on key\nmetrics. Thereafter each candidate\nlocation was assessed according\nto both financial (office costs,\naccommodation costs, travel costs,\ntax regimes favourable to high growth\nbusinesses, etc.) and non-financial\n(quality of life, access to transport,\netc.) factors. The study produced a\nmodel that assessed each candidate\nquantifiably based on collected\ndata and solid assumptions. This\nanalysis allowed the team to narrow\nthe candidates to 4 locations, which\nwere investigated more thoroughly.\nFinally, the top-scoring location was\nrecommended and the model was\ndelivered to the client.\nWhy should I join?\nThere are many reasons to\nparticipate in the projects, whether\nyou are interested in a career in\nconsulting or not. The projects allow\nyou tackle real problems outside the\ncontrolled environment of academic\nstudies in a team. Not only is this fun\nand satisfying, but the recruiters of\nalmost any industry will be impressed\nas well. If you are considering a career\nin consulting you will also have the\nopportunity to find out whether it\u2019s\nsomething for you or not. Having\nparticipated in multiple projects,\nyou will also have the opportunity to\nlead the projects and manage client\nrelations.\nYingkun Hou is a final year\nChemistry student who is involved\nin his second project: \u201dMy experience\nat ICG has truly been amazing. It has\nhelped me develop a range of skills that\ncan directly be applied in the field of\nconsulting, and has played a vital role\nfor me in getting an offer from a well-established consulting firm. I would\ndefinitely recommend anyone with an\ninterest in consulting and business to\ntake part in future projects.\u201d\nLorraine Choi is a second year EEE\nundergraduate who has participated\nin three projects: \u201cICG projects gave\nme valuable hands-on experience\nin the industry, which helped me to\nidentify my career interest.

Edsel, Bret Witter\nStarring: George Clooney, Matt\nDamon, Bill Murray, Jean Dujardin,\nHugh Bonneville, Cate Blanchett,\nJohn Goodman\nRuntime: 118 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nJack Steadman\nTreasured Writer\n10. Zero Dark Thirty\n9. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\n8. Oblivion\n7. Django Unchained\n6. Captain Phillips\n5. The Selfish Giant\n4. Star Trek: Into Darkness\n3. Le Week-End\n2. Filth\n1. The World\u2019s End\nBest films of 2013\nMichael Martin\nTreasured Writer\nThe opening of George Clooney\u2019s\nlatest directorial effort (which is also\nhis latest acting, writing, producing,\nand probably anything else you can\nthink of job) achieves the interesting\nfeat of being somehow both incredibly evocative \u2013 not just of World War\nII, but also of the whole generation of\nwar movies that followed \u2013 while also\nbeing somewhat flat. It\u2019s a weird feel-ing, and \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 it\u2019s one that\npersists for the majority of the film.\nIt\u2019s accompanied by the film\u2019s habit\nof feeling almost schizophrenic in\nplaces, as if it\u2019s not quite sure what\nkind of film it wants to be. Things\nstart off as you\u2019d expect (particularly\nif you\u2019ve seen any of the trailers), all\nblustering patriotism, inoffensive\njokes and a healthy dose of camaraderie \u2013 basic training actually prompts\na few laughs, which sounds like a really backhanded compliment now I\nthink about it. Most of the humour\nfalls a little flat \u2013 there aren\u2019t really\nmany actual laughs outside of basic,\neven though there are clearly moments where laughter is expected \u2013\nand things such as the running \u2018joke\u2019\nabout Matt Damon\u2019s character\u2019s appalling grasp of the French language\nare smirk-worthy the first time and\nthen almost immediately over-used\nand run into the ground.\nAnd then the shooting starts. This\nis a fairly bloodless war film (certainly\nno Saving Private Ryan), but it still attempts to make some efforts to show\nthe violence of war. It stumbles where\nSpielberg\u2019s War Horse soared, but it\ndoes at least try. Unfortunately, when\ncoupled with the earlier attempts at\ncomedy (attempts which continue inbetween the fighting), it leaves the film\nfeeling uneven, uncertain of whether\nit wants to maintain the light-hearted\ntone or abandon it in favour of something altogether more serious. Certainly, the message (which is repeated\napproximately fifty million times\nthroughout the film) about how cul-Not so monumental\nture \u2013 how art \u2013 helps define a people\nand how destroying that destroys the\nmemory of those people is a powerfully true one, but when coupled with the\nvague lack of seriousness that permeates much of The Monuments Men it\nends up feeling like background noise.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that all this is\naccompanied by a complete lack of\nnuance, and not just in the over-riding\nmessage. This is an incredibly black-and-white film, with no room to make\nany distinction between the fact that\nthe Monuments Men and the Allies\nare good, and the Nazis are bad. The\nclosest the film ever gets to adding in\na shade of grey is by pulling off a weird\nmid-point shift in \u2018who the enemy is\u2019\nand instead adopting Cold War lean-ings, as the Russians become the enemies for the protection of the stolen\nart. It\u2019s abrupt, jarring but does at\nleast make some sort of sense, lending a rather strong \u2018race against time\u2019\nelement to proceedings that serves to\npick up the pace from wherever it was\nhiding in the first half of the movie.\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all bad \u2013 there\nis emotion, and nuance, to be found\nhere, it\u2019s just in the performances\nrather than anything else. Continuing the recent trend of banking on the\ncharisma of an all-star cast, The Monuments Men does manage to produce\na few moments of genuine emotion,\nparticularly one (all too short) scene\nwith Bill Murray (although it proceeds to stomp all over that particular moment by cutting away to some\nrandom dying soldier we have quite\nliterally never met before and so have\nno reason to care about other than\nthe fact he\u2019s dying), and you can\u2019t help\nbut care about the fates of the Monuments Men themselves, and will them\nto succeed.\nIt\u2019s just a pity that the rest of the film\ncan\u2019t live up to its cast.\nThere are two things you should probably know about the fact that Mr Peabody & Sherman is a reboot/remake of\na kids\u2019 TV show from years ago. The\nfirst: as you may have guessed for the\nvague-ness of that last sentence, I have\nabsolutely no clue what the TV show\nwas like other than it existed. So I\u2019m\ngoing in as blind as you possibly are\nhere. The second: it\u2019s completely irrelevant here. This is a film that demands\nto be taken on its own merits (which\nis nice of it, I guess), and also one that\ntotally deserves it. Any history you\nneed to know (Mr Peabody\u2019s a talk-ing, hyper-intelligent dog, Sherman is\nthe human kid he adopted, we\u2019re done\nhere) was either in those brackets or\nis explained by Mr Peabody himself in\na delightful little opening monologue\n(which is, for the record, preceded by\nwhat is quite possibly the most surreal\nshort I have ever seen before a film,\nand I\u2019ve seen a lot of shorts before\nfilms at this point).\nFrom the chuckle-inducing opening\n(weird short aside), the film manages\nto maintain an impressively high gag\nquotient for a film that\u2019s been almost\nexclusively billed as \u2018for kids\u2019, and a lot\nof the jokes are pretty smart at that \u2013\nmy personal favourite was an Oedipus\njoke tucked away in a quick-fire rattle\nthrough various quirky characters of\nGreek mythology. It\u2019s a disarmingly\nsweet take on a significant chunk of\nworld history, serving that desirable\ndual purpose teachers must adore:\neducating and entertaining.\nThere\u2019s not really a large amount else\nto say about this film, in all honesty \u2013\nthat smart, quick sense of humour is\neasily the biggest attraction. The visuals are good quality, but in these days\nthat\u2019s nothing to write home about,\nwhile the plot itself is pretty good but\nis rather flagrantly an excuse to shoehorn in as many parodies and historical jokes as humanly (caninely?) pos-sible. It even squeezes in some rather\nobvious (and mildly weird in places)\nsentimentality too, but even that\u2019s justified by a cute Spartacus joke. It\u2019s also\napparently \u201cmore logical\u201d than some\nother recent film, but I think I laughed\nwhile scribbling down that particular\ncomparison and it\u2019s now just an illegible squiggle. So there you go. It\u2019s\nmore logical than \u201cpsfhskgjsh\u201d. Whatever that is.\nThat\u2019s not an accurate transcription,\nfor the record. Obviously.\nOverall, then, Mr Peabody & Sherman is just great. But it\u2019s just that.\nAn entertaining romp through history with enough to entertain kids and\ngrown-up kids alike.\nMr Peabody &\nSherman\nDirector: Rob Minkoff\nWriters: Jay Ward, Craig Wright\nStarring: (voices) Ty Burrell, Max\nCharles, Ariel Winters\nRuntime: 92 minutes\nCertification: U\nJack Steadman\nTreasured Writer\nA smart talking dog\n\n"

My chairing colleague\nwas Greek, and the delegates come\nfrom all parts of the world. You could\nhear over 10 different languages being\nspoken in the same Huxley LT. My\ncommittee was both a celebration of\nscience and a celebration of culture,\nand I certainly took pride in being an\nambassador of Imperial College!\u201d\nCommentary from Ahmed Raja, a\nfirst year Theoretical Physics student,\nDelegate in the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency 2014 Simulation:\n\u201cThis experience was mind-blowing,\none of the best events of my year so\nfar! It showed me a whole new way of\ntackling global issues and of working\nwith new people. It was inspiring,\nmotivating, entertaining and most\nimportantly a blast, especially the\nsocial sessions! I highly recommend it\nto anyone!\u201d\nCommentary from Filip\nKarasiewicz, a second year\nAeronautical Engineering student,\nStaffer in the LIMUN 2014 Logistics\nTeam:\n\u201cI have organised and participated\nin numerous MUN conferences over\nthe last 5 years. After being a part\nof LIMUN last year as a delegate, I\ndecided to join the team \u2018on the other\nside\u2019 as a volunteer in the Logistics\nTeam. This role demanded overseeing\nthe preparation, smooth running and\nclosure of the entire event. Recalling\ntheMUNweekendIstillcannotrefrain\nfrom what can only be described\nas an overwhelming excitement\nThis conference was something\nspectacular. It\u2019s sheer size, to begin\nwith \u2013 1,600 participants from every\ncorner of the world \u2013 was almost\nincomprehensible. When I talked to\nthe delegates I found it flabbergasting\nthat so many people travelled from\nas far as Indonesia or Taiwan just\nfor those three days of celebration of\nworld\u2019s youth\u2019s diplomatic initiative\nand global awareness. When asked\nabout the challenge the conference\nposed, in terms of logistics, I chuckled\nand said: To be frank, I did not\nanticipate half of the work that had\nto be done throughout those three\ndays. If it weren\u2019t for a fantastic and\na coherent team that put the effort\ntowards making it happen, we would\nnot have experienced LIMUN as it\nwas. Making such a gigantic clock tick\nis a humungous task, but with great\nresponsibility comes even greater\nsatisfaction. In the end, LIMUN 2014\nturned out to be a success beyond\nwhat we could have imagined and I\nsimply cannot help but impatiently\nawait its 16th edition in February\n2015.\u201d\nCommentary from Aditya\nRanjan, a second year Aeronautical\nEngineering student, Chair of\nthe United Nations Development\nProgramme 2014 Simulation:\n\u201cDeveloping a sense of pride in\na country that you represent for\na conference, but may never even\nhave visited, is an important part of\nevery MUN conference. The beauty\nof MUN is that you meet someone\nfrom a country you never gave a\nsecond thought to, and you end up\nspending three hours talking about\nthe life they lead in their homeland\nand it is nothing like you could ever\nhave imagined. I was an extremely\nshy kid and it was MUN that really\ntaught me to communicate my ideas\neffectively and to persuade people.\nOnce you move from being a delegate\nto being a chair, it isn\u2019t just about your\nideas and the position of the country\nthat you are representing, it\u2019s about\nfinding a way to bring contradicting\nideas together to form a common\nglobal solution. MUN for is me only\n50% about the debate, the other 50% is\nthe social aspect where you meet the\nmost diverse set of people, in terms of\nreligion, ethnicity, nationality, subject\narea and pretty much every other\ncharacteristic, that you could ever\nimagine. The most important part is\nthe people you meet and the friends\nyou make during the conference. You\nnever run out of interesting people to\nlearn about and learn from, and that\u2019s\nwhat has kept me going back to MUN\nAhmed Raja having a blast in IAEA\nShiladitya Ghosh, UN Women Chair\nby day...
