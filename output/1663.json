American\nGods, an adaptation of\nGaiman\u2019s 2001 novel by the\nsame name, is at its heart an\nexamination of faith and the\never-changing nature of the\naltars at which we worship.\nBeing familiar with Gaiman\u2019s\nSandman mythos but never\nhaving read American Gods\nmyself, I approached the\nseries not quite knowing\nwhat to expect. What I\u2019ve\nexperienced in the first two\nepisodes, however, has me\nkeen to see more.\nAmerican Gods follows\nShadow Moon, a convict\nreleased early upon news\nof his wife\u2019s death, as he is\nrecruited by the enigmatic Mr.\nWednesday as a bodyguard.\nWednesday, at first glance\na simple con-man, quickly\nreveals himself to be one of\nthe old Gods inclined on starting a war with the new ones;\nscience, technology, and the\nlike. The episodes themselves\nopen with a vignette; each\nchronicling the arrival of\na people and their god to\nAmerica, and simultaneously\nexploring what Gaiman\nbelieves to be one of the\ncore facets of the American\nbedrock.\nThese openings are\nexcellently crafted, with\ntight pacing that is echoed\nthroughout the main bodies\nof the episodes. A switch to a\nmore \u2018cinematic\u2019 aspect ratio,\ncoupled with a voice-over\nhelps differentiate these from\nthe rest of the show. Unfortunately, the narration can be\na bit verbose and self-impor-tant, but this is always one\nof the slight risks with, and\ncharms of, Gaiman\u2019s works.\nParticularly praiseworthy is\nthe introduction of the West\nAfrican trickster god Anansi,\na powerfully performed\nscene that excellently sets\nup the episode\u2019s running\ntheme. Specifically, how one\nmakes the decision between\nsubmitting to oppression or\nfighting it, even at the cost\nof one\u2019s life. The smash cut\nending to this vignette is used\nwell to this effect. In fact, the\nshow really seems to revel in\nSurreal is the new real.\\\\ Starz\nusing smash cuts. While this\nmight normally feel jarring\nand off-putting, here it serves\nto accentuate the surrealist\nimagery embraced by the\nseries.\nWild colour palettes, and\nthematically in-tune scoring\nhelp to further set the scene.\nIn particular, the soundtrack\nin the first quarter of the first\nepisode creates a pervasive\nsense of unease in the viewer\nthat matches well the sense\nof unease in the protagonist\u2019s\nmind. The visuals, for their\npart, are simply sublime.\nClearly, ludicrous amounts of\nmoney have been thrown at\nthe production. This is a welcome necessity, as otherwise\nthe series would have lost\nmuch of its dramatic gravitas,\ngiven how much it relies on\nabstract imagery. The confluence of these elements does\nan excellent job of realising\nthe Gods, and boy are they\nterrifying.\nFurther amplifying the\npresence of the Gods are,\nof course, the performances\nthemselves. By now we\nexpect nothing short of excellence from Ian McShane, and\nstill he manages to surprise.\nMcShane\u2019s versatility is on\ndisplay here, as he fills out\nthe variety that might be\nexpected from a con man.\nOrlando Jones also deserves\nspecial mention for his turn as\nAnansi. He manages to leave\na lasting impression with only\na brief appearance so far.\nIn addition, Ricky Whittle\nproves a more than capable\nlead; reacting pretty much\nhow you\u2019d\nexpect\nYou\u2019re never too old for a road trip.\\\\ Starz\na sane man discovering the\ninsanity of the world to react.\nThese first two episodes do\nan excellent job of pulling\nin viewers and keeping\ntheir interest. At points, they\ncan be a bit schizophrenic,\nthrowing a lot of disparate\nconcepts at the viewer with\nno clear indication that they\nwill be explained later. However, this is more forgiveable\nin the age of binge watching\nthan it would have been in\nthe past. Television shows,\n\\\\ Particularly\npraiseworthy is the\nintroduction of the\nWest African trickster god Anansi \\\\\nspecifically long form dramas\nhave become increasingly\nserialized. For its part, American Gods keeps a measured\npace, and as a consequence,\ndoesn\u2019t frustrate or confound\nthe viewer with too much\ninformation. With the exception of the vignettes, it also\nmanages to avoid relying\non exposition dumps, to its\ncredit. Explanations are not\nprovided on a platter, but\nthere are more than enough\nclues for astute viewers to\nput things together for them-selves. As Wednesday says\nat one point, he\u2019s \u201ceasing [us]\ninto it\u201d.\nIf there\u2019s one thing that\nreally bothers me about the\nseries, it\u2019s the title sequence.\nIt\u2019s loud, garish, and an\nassault on the senses in all\nthe wrong ways. I can, at\nleast, appreciate the\nintent behind it; the\nevocation of traditional tribal and\nreligious chants.\nMinor gripe\naside, the series\nis definitely worth\nwatching, and\nit\u2019s fair to say that\nAmerican Gods\nhas definitely made\na believer out of me.\n\\\\ Clearly, ludicrous\namounts of money\nhave been thrown at\nthe production. \\\\\n\n"

I first asked myself\nthis question in 2011 when I started my Biology\nundergraduate. My department had just sacked\nmost, if not all of its plant scientists. There was no\nmoney in the field. Have I come close to an answer\nsince? Maybe. Sometimes I\u2019ve looked at Imperial\nand higher education in the UK in general and I\u2019ve\nfelt disgusted by it. The way research is determined by\ncorporate giants, whether that\u2019s Big Oil or Pharma, or\nwhether it\u2019s weapons, or it\u2019s banks. The way academics\nare pressured to publish, to bring in the money, to\nignore things that in any other workplace would be\nuncompromisable. The way students are seen as cash\ncows, cheap labour, endless in supply, desperate.\nOther times I look around me and I can\u2019t help but\nbe in awe. Of the people I\u2019m surrounded by; some\nof my generation\u2019s brightest minds. Of the ideas that\nare constantly being exchanged, lighting up the eyes\nof students and staff. Of the tenacity with which some\npeople can hunt for ideals, knowledge, dreams.\nThe struggle to divest lies at the border between the\ndark and the light sides of science. We know fossil fuel\nuse is unsustainable. Every step of the production line\nin the fossil fuel industry ravages the environment and\ndetriments our health. Yet our civilization relies on it\nstill.\nI understand the energy crisis humanity is facing at\nthe moment is a challenging one. But unfortunately it\u2019s\none we have to overcome, there is no alternative. We\nchange or we go down with the ship.\nAnd here is where it gets complicated. As much as\nI might badmouth it (and I do a lot), I don\u2019t believe\nImperial to be morally bankrupt. But I do think that as\na science institution we get trapped in the numbers and\nfacts and logistics and practicalities and complexities\nof the situation. And maybe it\u2019s time to take a step\nback from the science and think about the ethics of our\nactions, our investments.\nIt\u2019s time to make a decision based on our heart and\ninvest in our dreams instead.\nT H E\nT E A M\nAddress | felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB || Telephone | 02075948072 || Printed by | Mortons Media\nGroup Ltd Media Centre, Morton Way, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, LN9 6JR || Registered Newspaper | ISSN 1040-0711 || Copyright\n\u00a9 felix 2016\nEditor-in-Chief | Lef Apostolakis || Deputy Editor | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || News Editor | Matt Johnston, Joanna Wormald || Comment\nEditors | Vivien Hadlow, Tessa Davey || Culture Ringmaster | Fred Fyles || Culture Editors | Indira Mallik, Meryl Anil, Anurag Deshpande,\nTheo Farah, Simran Kukran, Cale Tilford || Puzzles Editor | Hamish Beck || Clubs & Societies Editor | Abigail de Bruin || Science Editor |\nLizzie Riach, Ipsita Herlekar || Millennials Queen | Tessa Davey || Millennials Editors | Saad Ahmed, Sanjay Battacharaya || Sports Editor\n| Sam Smith || Illustrator | Nathan Macabuag || Copy Chief | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || Copy Editors | Alex Adler || Cover | Alex Clark |\nCentrefold | Lef Apostolakis\nJust rubbing\nit in now\nLetterstotheeditor\nIn response to Are millennials too entitled or do\nwe just desreve better? which appeared in issue\n1662\nR\nemember last\nweek\u2019s postgrad\ngraduation day? It\nmade the Union of\nton of dough. The\nlargest graduation\nceremony to date which saw\na record of 9,400 guests\nattend, brought Union shops\nand outlets a total of \u00a334,715.\nThat\u2019s about 13 grand more\nthan last year and eight grand\nmore than the record year of\n2015.\nPostgrad Graduation Day\nsaw over 3,284 graduates\nreceiving their diplomas. That\nmeans that proud families\nspent a tenner on average on\ntheir graduates. That\u2019s on top\nof the \u00a351-58 that gown hire\ncosts and a hat purchase (you\ncan\u2019t hire them) which will set\nyou back another \u00a330.

If\nUnion reels in \u00a334,000 from\nPostgrad Graduation Day\nyou think it\u2019s worth it, to watch\nBoyce Avenue at the Royal\nAlbert Hall in November, booking a ticket now wouldn\u2019t cost\nyou less than \u00a330. And these\nare just the essentials.\nWe\u2019re not even going to talk\nabout pictures, wax figurines\nand engraved rings.\nFrom ticket sales to the graduates\u2019 family and friends,\nCollege is estimated to have\nmade about \u00a3328,000.\nWhen asked about profits\na College spokesperson said\nthat Imperial \u201cendeavours to\nkeep the cost of Graduation\nday as low as possible and\nwe do not charge students\nfor their attendance [Aw how\nsweet]. The income received\nfrom guest tickets only covers\npart of the cost to the College\n\u2013 no surplus funds whatsoever\nare received from Graduation.\nI guess thanks are in order.\nDear Lef,\nI enjoyed Tessa\u2019s article on millennials\nand entitlement in the May 5 edition. As\na lecturer who was an undergraduate\nat Imperial in the early 90s I\u2019ve seen the\nissue from both sides I guess. Teaching\nalways seemed low on the priority list in\nmy days in EE yet when the teaching was\ngood it was brilliant. Eric Yeatman, Chris\nToumazou and others I\u2019m looking at you.\nBut what about the wider question of\nwhether today\u2019s young people are entitled or obliged? Back in my day, the gov\npaid for my first degree and there was\neven some drinking money left over in my\ngrant cheque. Contrast that with today\u2019s\ntuition fees, with a generation expected\nto top up national pensions to which they\nthemselves are unlikely to be entitled,\nwith little hope of owning their own\nproperty unless their parents happen to\nbe rich, who therefore suffer a transfer of\nwealth from themselves to older wealthier\nlandlords enjoying rising property values\nand cheap mortgages. Millennials will\nretire at an older age than people like me\nand will inherit from their predecessors\nthe uncertainties of climate change, the\nresulting refugee disaster, the decision to\nleave Europe and a volatile geopolitical\nscene.

The\nsystem has been part of IC\u2019s\nthe email.\nThe Panopto recording of the\nrevision session will be made\navailable again shortly. In\nresponse to enquiries Martyn\nBoutelle, Director of Courses\nfor Bioengineering said that \u201ca\nreplacement exam paper was\nfairly straightforward to write\nas we did not need to devise\nnew problem-based questions\nthat need a lot of testing. The\nquestions were then reviewed\ninternally and by an External\nExaminer, following our\nnormal procedures. The whole\nprocess followed in response\nto this issue was also approved\nby an External Examiner.\u201d\nBoutelle added that on\nWednesday\u2019s revision class\n\u201call seemed well\u201d and that\nstudents seemed satisfied\nfollowing their exam on\nThursday.\nteaching arsenal for years\nnow allowing staff to record\nlive lectures, special events,\ntutorials and more.\nWhen students got back\nhome, they found out that the\nentire exam they\u2019d be taking\nthe following week was online.\n\u201cYeah naturally we realised\npretty quickly what her mistake\nwas,\u201d said a student that\nprefers to remain anonymous.\nFollowing the realisation\nof the mistake by the\nBioengineering department,\nthe Panopto recording of the\nrevision session was taken\ndown and an email was sent\nout apologising for the fuck-up.\n\u201cSeveral students had\nviewed the recording by the\ntime we found out, and so the\npaper and its questions can\ntherefore not be used as this\nyear\u2019s exam and so another\npaper will be written,\u201d read\n\n"

Grounded in\n1980s New York, the action\nsprawls across reality and\ndelusion, from Salt Lake\nCity to Washington DC,\nfrom Antarctica to Heaven,\ndancing on the edge of utter\nmadness but never stumbling.\nTony Kushner\u2019s writing is\nbold, profound, and urgent,\nwith frequent bright sparks of\ncomedic brilliance. Even on\nthe occasions the script spirals\ninto dense segments of over-the acting. Nathan Lane is\nincandescent as Roy Cohn,\na real-life lawyer who\ndesperately tries to deny his\nhomosexuality even as he\nslowly dies from Aids. His\nenergy never wanes, even\nacross hours of turning purple\nin the face from bellowing\nMalcolm Tucker-esque profanity at anyone who will listen.\nIn any other production,\nperhaps Lane could\u2019ve stolen\nthe show but here he is given\na run for his money from his\ncastmates, which seem to be\ngiving the performance of\ntheir lives.\nDenise Gough playing\nHarper Pitt, a woman who\nis verging constantly on\nthe edge of psychosis, is\nfunny, heart-breaking and\nultimately uplifting. Nathan\nStewart-Jarett, familiar from\nChannel 4\u2019s Misfits lights up\nthe stage as the witty, warm\nand wise Belize, often the\nsole voice of reason amongst\na group of characters where\neach is more neurotic than the\nlast. Amanda Lawrence as\nThe Angel is truly magnificent,\nfilled with the manifest dignity\nthat Kushner demands of the\nrole in the stage notes to the\nplay.\nAs for Andrew Garfield,\nwho plays Prior Walter, a\ndrag queen who finds his life\nirrevocably changed when\nhe finds a Karposi\u2019s Sarcoma\nlesion on his arm, this is surely\na career-defining perfor-mance. He is impossible to\nlook away from even when\nhis character slips out of the\nspotlight. It\u2019s a tender, camp,\nhumorous performance which\nmatures over the course of\nthe play. There are moments\nearly on where the characterization drifts ever so slightly\ninto the realm of stereotype,\nbut perhaps this too, is\nintended \u2013 after all, Angels in\nAmerica is just as much about\ntypes of people as it is about\nliving, breathing humans.\nAt its core, Kushner\u2019s\npolemic is a searing account\nof the Aids crisis, a modern\nplague, and the destruction\nit wreaked over the lives of\nyoung gay men who found\nthemselves as patients with\nterminal diagnoses or the\ncarers of dying friends and\nlovers in their 20s and 30s.\nRecent healthcare reforms in\nAmerica have fuelled fears\nanew that the new administration will mark a return\nof government inaction as\nepidemics rage on. Much\nof the political art created in\nthe shadow of Reagan and\nThatcherite politics seems all\ntoo relevant now. One need\nnot delve too deep to look for\nparallels; the morally bank-rupt, corrupt, Roy Cohn was\nDonald Trump\u2019s legal advisor.\nAngels in America rages\nagainst the hard-line religious\nAngels in\nAmerica\nIndira Mallik\nAngels in America is on at the National\nTheatre. Normal tickets are sold out\nbut hundred of \u00a320 tickets are being\nreleased by ballot. NT Live will begin\nstreaming performances from the 20th of\nJuly.\nDenise Gough as Harper and Andrew Garfield as\nPrior in Angels in America : Perestroika \\\\ Helen\nMaybanks\narching philosophising, this\ncast and crew make it soar.\nDirector Marianne Elliot,\nwho in 2011 won a Tony\nAward for War Horse, has\ncreated a theatrical spectacle to be marvelled over.\nColumns of fire erupt inches\nfrom the audience, hospital\nrooms rise from the bowels\nof the stage, neon shining\nladders are thrown down\nfrom Heaven, New York\napartments transfigure themselves into the snow drifts of\nAntarctica and back again all\nunder a deconstructed space-age cathedral dome. Special\nmention go to production\ndesigners Finn Caldwell and\nNick Barnes who have fashioned The Angel's \u201csteel grey\nwings\u201d from huge feathered\ncontraptions that are operated by balletic puppeteers.\nAs magnificent as the staging is, it never overshadows\nconservative movement that\nsees \u2018progress\u2019 as a dirty\nword. Yet, whilst its nearest literary relative, Larry Kramer\u2019s\nThe Normal Heart, also about\nthe Aids crisis in New York, is\nsustained on a steady stream\nof righteous anger, Kushner\u2019s\nAngels ultimately takes a\nmore hopeful stance. It is an\node, as the Thomas Lux poem\ngoes, to the unbroken world\nthat is coming.\nOn press night, the end of\nthe second part, Perestroika,\nreceived a thunderous\nstanding ovation. It was in\nno small part a reaction to\nthe final scene which Andrew\nGarfield makes magical in a\nway that is difficult to convey.\nSpeaking to the Hollywood\nReporter at the Oscar\nActors Roundtable earlier\nin the year, Garfield spoke\neloquently of the importance\nof creating art that speaks\nto marginalised communities\nwho are desperately looking\nfor media that represents\nthem, that recognises them:\nAngels in America is one of\nthose rare gems. Go and see\nit.\n\\\\ The action\nsprawls across\nreality and delusion,\nfrom Salt Lake City\nto Washington DC,\nfrom Antarctica to\nHeaven, dancing\non the edge of utter\nmadness but never\nstumbling \\\\\n\\\\ For Andrew\nGarfield, who plays\nPrior Walter, drag\nqueen who finds\nhis life irrevocably\nchanged when he\nfinds a Karposi\u2019s\nSarcoma lesion on\nhis arm, this is surely\na career-defining\nperformance \\\\\n\n"

The film\u2019s beautiful\nvisuals are hard to ignore and\ncoupled with an emotionally-stirring storyline, Super 8\nsucceeds in becoming more\nthan a mere homage to\nSpielberg.\n(A fair bit of warning to\nreaders, like myself, inexperienced in 70\u2019s filmmaking\n\\\\ Super 8 is\nfilled with cultural\nremnants from the\n1970\u2019s \\\\\ndemeanour reaffirms the\nnotion that he\u2019s unfit for the\nrole of a father. Scratch the\nveneer of the town\u2019s mysterious goings-on, and the\nworried lives of a few Lillian\nresidents becomes percep-tible, with many touching\nscenes setting the tone for a\nfilm that deals with themes of\nforgiveness and letting go.\nSuper 8 is filled with cultural\nremnants from the 1970\u2019s,\nlike the Walkman cassette\nplayer and Blondie\u2019s \u2018Heart\nof Glass\u2019, just in case the\nviewer wasn\u2019t watching the\nfilm keenly enough to notice\nthe characters dressed in\nunmistakably 70\u2019s-fashioned\nclothes and driving 70\u2019s-period cars, not to mention the\nliberal culture around recreational substances at the time\n(\u201cYou wanna buy some pot?\u201d,\n\n"

    "content": "THE FINAL | second half\nBelgium: Blanche - City Lights\nBelgium also put forward a 17 year old singer, Ellie Delvaux, who was previously a contestant on the Belgian version of The\nVoice. Sadly was eliminated early on in the contest, but that didn\u2019t stop her being chosen to compete in Eurovision. Alone\non stage, she combines a maturity beyond her years with and obvious naivety and innocence that makes her performance\nendearing. However, there isn\u2019t to this song beyond generic indie-pop. She visibly relaxed into her performance during\nthe semi-final, so there may be more to come from Blanche in the final.\nBulgaria: Kristian Kostov - Beautiful Mess\nBulgaria debuted in the Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev in 2005, but have only qualified for the final twice in the years\nsince then. Last year, they came fourth, and now they\u2019re joining the many other countries to enter an adorable 17 year old\nsinger who was a finalist in The Voice Kids Russia, and was a runner up in X Factor Bulgaria. He makes good use of visual\neffects and is edgy beyond his years \u2013 probably the most interesting of the 17 year olds. His performance in the semi-final\nwas sleek and mature, and his breathy thanks to Europe as he finished unbelievable endearing. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if\nhe scores well.\nCyprus: Hovig - Gravity\nCyprus have been relatively unsuccessful over the last fifteen years of Eurovision, but not might be time for them to shine.\nTheir song was penned by Thomas G:son, a Swedish writer well-known in Eurovision circles who has written winning songs\nin the past. Hovig, who same seventh in the 2009 season of Greece\u2019s X-factor, has previously attempted to represent\nCyprus at Eurovision in 2010 and 2015. With the opening having elements that are suspiciously similar to Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone\nMan\u2019s Human, it uses familiarity with a similar song to replace the recognition of a song that has already been successful\nacross Europe to generate votes. The hints of EDM give this song a modern twist on what is a classic Europop perfor-mance, but it\u2019s still way too generic. There\u2019s nothing to write home about either in the song, or the staging.\nFrance: Alma - Requiem\nFrance have been one of the most consistent countries in the Eurovision Song Contest, missing only two years, and\nwinning five times. This year, Alma\u2019s Requiem has been the subject of a scandal where it was discovered that it\nwas performed prior to the submission deadline. As such, they\u2019ve adjusted their classic formula of beautiful French\ngirl sings about love by adding an English chorus, which I\u2019m sure is to the chagrin of the French public who are\nnormally sticklers for purity. The performance is dull, relying on Paris\u2019 romanticism to do a lot of the work as she\nperforms in front of a swirling Parisienne aerial view. There\u2019s nothing special about the French entry, but there\u2019s nothing objectionable either, so it could go either way.\nGermany: Levina - Perfect Life\nGermany are the only country to compete in every single Eurovision since its inception, but have won only twice. Like\nPoland, they\u2019re playing the familiarity game with Perfect Life. There\u2019s definitely more than a hint of David Guetta\u2019s Titanium in this, but the performance is absolutely classic Eurovision, down to the coiffure and shoulder pads. Although the\nrecording of this song feels modern by Eurovision standards, the live performance is reminiscent of Eurovision of old, this\ncould appeal to older voters who may not make up enough of the demographic to make a difference.\nEUROVISSUE\nEUROVISSUE\nEUROVISSUE\nEurope\u2019s cousins from a slightly different part of the world seem to have been honorarily adopted into the Eurobubble,\nand it looks like they\u2019re here to stay. They came second last year and fifth in 2015, and it seems like we love the novelty.\nAustralia\u2019s entry is 17 year old Isaiah Firebrace, who like the Danish entry, rose to fame by winning an Australian reality\nmusic show. He performs alone on stage while continually walking without going anywhere on a rotating platform.\nThey\u2019re one of the only countries to be bold enough to use giant moving pictures of the performer as the background\nsplash; closeups of the singer\u2019s puppy dog eyes creating an intensity and passion that is reflected in his intense eyebrows.\nIt\u2019s a strong Eurovision ballad, and should propel Australia to a high score.\nAustralia: Isaiah - Don\u2019t Come Easy\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nNorway: JOWST - Grab The Moment\nNorway have been the subject of some scandal this year. Joakim With Steen performs with some vocals on the backing\ntrack from Norwegian singer Aleksander Walmann. Eurovision rules state that all vocals must be performed live, but\nNorway have managed to escape penalty by passing them off as entirely sound effects, and not crediting the vocals. The\naesthetic and sounds are incredible modern for Eurovision, and while their vision is clear, it\u2019s probably not going to work\nfor the majority of the millions of Europeans watching.\nRomania are sporting a strong two contrasting performers: one with a strong 90s RnB meets Justin from the Darkness vibe,\ncombined with a weird yodelling situation. I didn\u2019t realise that Romania had a strong history of yodelling, and it turns out\nthat I was right not to. As a reaction to Switzerland putting forward a Romania band as their entry, Romania decided\nto \u201csend a yodeller in return.\u201d Sadly, the outfits that made me so happy in their music video didn\u2019t make it to the staged\nperformance, but the quirk is definitely not lost, what with the puppets on the back splash and the unexplained cannons on\nstage. This is definitely one of those \u201conly at Eurovision\u201d ones \u2013 maybe it could win.\nRomania: Ilinca and Alex Florea - Yodel It!\nSpain: Manel Navarro - Do It For Your Lover\nThe selection of Manel Navarro was extremely controversial, with even Spanish politicians weighing in on the selection\nprocess. Navarro co-wrote his own song, which automatically gets a place in the final as Spain is one of the Big Five \u2013 who\nknows if he would made it otherwise. Obnoxiously laid back, he seems to have forgotten that Eurovision is a contest in\nwhich people usually perform in formalwear, because he\u2019s forgotten to do up his shirt. With a performance that lies somewhere between Jack Johnson and One Direction, I can\u2019t see it being particularly successful.\nRobin Bengtsson, controversially, was not the Swedish public\u2019s first choice for their Eurovision contestant. However, thanks\nto the novel Swedish selection technique of using an international panel representing the Eurovision community to give\nadded points, Bengtsson was bumped into the winning slot. From the music video released on Eurovision.tv ahead of the\nsemi-finals, Bengtsson\u2019s performance, while clean and well rehearsed, feels sterile. The performance in the semi-finals was\nalmost identical, from the opening camera shots to the four hipsters in turtlenecks performing a dance reminiscent of OK\nGo on neon-edged treadmills. Will Bengtsson\u2019s attempts to seduce with sultry eyebrow movements pay off in the finals?\nSweden are tipped to do well, but to me, the Swedish entry lacks the authentic passion that makes a Eurovision winner.\nSweden: Robin Bengtsson - I Can\u2019t Go On\nUnited Kingdom: Lucie Jones - Never Give Up On You\nIt\u2019s no secret that the UK tends to be a little unpopular when it comes to Eurovision votes. Although you wonder whether we\neven take our choice of artist seriously \u2013 think back to when we genuinely entered Scooch with a weird air hostess themed\nsong \u2013 it\u2019s pretty clear from the political voting that we wouldn\u2019t win either way. This year, we seem to have a somewhat\nlegitimate entry, with the Welsh Lucie Jones from 2009\u2019s X-Factor performing a song written by Emmelie de Forest, who\nwrote and performed Denmark\u2019s winning entry in 2013. When Jones sings, \u201cI will never give up on you, I don\u2019t care what\nI\u2019ve got to lose\u201d we can ask whether she\u2019s reaching out to Europe, and laying down a stance on Brexit. It\u2019s a strong ballad,\nbut when even Theresa May admits that we\u2019re not going to get any points this year, is there any point?\nAfter winning last year with a very political performance, Ukraine don\u2019t seem to be able to stick to the tried and trusted\nEurovision themes of peace and love. In their music video, O.Torvald stand astride stylised mountains of rubbish, with\ndigital clocks counting down on their chests, urging us to take time to look around and find a world without violence.\nUnfortunately, this didn\u2019t make it to the final, but you can expect a strong visual performance nonetheless. Ukraine have\na strong Eurovision pedigree, winning twice since they first took part in 2003, and usually making it to the top ten. I don\u2019t\nexpect this year to be any different.\nUkraine: O.Torvald - Time\nOn first listen, this is another generic Europop song about love from a country that wants to compete, but ultimately does\nnot want to win for fear of struggling to afford to host the competition. But this song grows on you, and this is sure to be\na summer club hit in Europe. Greece use a tried and tested Eurovision formula of a beautiful woman surrounded by buff\nmen. During the chorus, Demy rises out of the stage on a podium as two men wearing only what appears to be breeches\nsplash in a pool at her feet, possibly also singing the backing vocals. The meaning of these men is unclear, but this is a\ncatchy club song that you\u2019ll be hearing more of over the coming months, even if Europe somehow decides not to vote for a\nEurovision formula that has done well in the past.\nGreece: Demy - This Is Love\n\n"

    "content": "12 felixonline.co.uk/science felix.science@ic.ac.uk Friday 12 May 2017\nfelix S C I E N C E\nForestshavebeenhidinginplainsight\nAndrada Balmez explains how we\u2019ve only just discovered 467 million hectares of forest\nS\ncientists have\nbeen missing\nthe forest for the\ntrees; literally, it\nturns out. A team\nof international\nscientists have found that\ndryland forest cover could\nbe 40% to 47% higher\nthan previously estimated.\nThis corresponds to 467\nmillion hectares (Mha) of\nforest that have never been\nreported before (and this is\napproximately 250 times the\nsize of Wales or seven times\nthe surface of France). The\nreport increases the current\nestimates of global forest\nby at least 9%, the team\nreported.\nDryland biomes cover\n40% of the Earth\u2019s surface\nand from the Mediterranean\nSea to central India, from\nSouth America to the Russian\nFederation, they contain some\nof the most threatened ecosys-tems, including seven out of\nthe 25 biodiversity hotspots.\nPrevious estimates of\ndryland forests have been\nincongruous due to inconsistency in methods and reliance\non national cover statistics.\nFor example different studies\nwould use satellite images\nvarying in resolution, different\nmapping approaches and\neven different definition of\nwhat constitutes a forest, now\ndefined as \u201cland spanning\nan area of more than 0.5ha\nwith a tree cover over 10%\nthat is not predominantly used\nfor agriculture or urban land\nuse, as well as land on which\ntree cover is temporarily\nunder 10%, but is expected\nto recover\u201d. Moreover,\nthe study also considered\nnon-tropical dry forests which\nhadn\u2019t been mapped using\nsatellite imagery before. This\nlatest estimate used global\nsatellite data from Google\nEarth, with high spatial\nresolution imagery. Even\nso, distinguishing trees from\nshrubs, disentangling reflectance and shadows proved\nto be difficult sometimes, the\nresearchers warn.\nThis estimation also solves\na field conundrum: the\ndissonance between land\nuse and land cover. Land\nuse is employed to describe\nareas that are used by man\n(urban, agricultural, indus-trial) whereas land cover\ndescribes natural ecosystems.\nIn the past, estimates of land\nuse and land cover didn\u2019t\nquite add up to our global\nland surface. But this work\nhas managed to bridge the\ndisparity.\nIn the future we could get\na much clearer idea of how\nmuch carbon is stored in\nforests. At the moment our\nestimates are not as accurate\nas they could be due to the\ndiscrepancies in the forest\ncoverage, but if we want\nto construct better models\n\\\\ This is\napproximately 250\ntimes the size of\nWales \\\\\nin order to know what we\nshould expect from climate\nchange, we ought to improve\nthose estimates. Currently, the\nrate of deforestation predicts\nthat rainforests might disappear in the next 100 years,\npossibly replaced by dryland\nforests as the dryland biomes\nwill extend.\nHowwe\u2019llmeet-eorourmaker\nLizzie Riach discusses the subtleties of a meteor apocalypse\nN\new computer\nsimulations\nhave found\nthat if an\nasteroid\nimpacted\nEarth, humans would be more\nlikely to die from the blast\nitself, and not the subsequent\neffects it would have on the\nplanet. A comforting thought.\nThe shock waves, extreme\nwinds and falling bits of space\nrock would probably deal the\nsurrounding humanity its final\nblow. That is, according to\nrecent computer simulations\nconducted by planetary\nscientists lead by Clemens\nRumpf.\nOne of the simulations\ntargeted London specifically,\nsimulating a 200-metre-wide\nspace rock hurtling at a\nspeed of 20 kilometres per\nsecond. The results indicated\nthat around two thirds of all\nsuggested fatalities would\nbe a result of shock waves\nand extreme winds carrying\ndebris.\nThe range of damage\nseen in simulations was, as\nyou\u2019d expect, very broad,\nwith some impacts killing\nover 117 million people, and\nothers posing no threat at\nall, with smaller space rocks\nexploding in the atmosphere\nbefore reaching the ground.\nTsunamis became the main\ndanger for asteroids landing\nin water (accounting for\naround 70-80% of the total\ndeaths from each of these\nimpacts). Despite this, the simulations showed land impacts\nto be much more catastrophic\nfor life than those landing in\nthe oceans, due to the likely\nproximity of dense human\npopulations.\nBut you can rest easy. In\nreality, fatal asteroids are\nvery rare. Meteors that slip\nthrough, like the 20 metre\nwide rock that shook the\nRussian city of Chelyabinsk\nin 2013 are predicted to\nonly frequent Earth every\ncentury. Impacts like the one\nsuspected of driving the dinosaurs to extinction 66 million\nyears ago are believed to\nonly occur once every 100\nmillion years.\nBut, as is the nature of\nmost natural phenomena,\nmeteors can\u2019t be predicted.\nAstronomers are constantly\nscouting the skies for potential\ndangers. Others ask the\nquestion: so what if we were\nin the line of fire? How would\nwe divert this space rock?\nProposals include countering\nthe asteroid with a high speed\nspacecraft to throw it off\ncourse, or initiating nuclear\nexplosion to propel it away\n(the \u201cAsteroid impact avoidance\u201d wiki page highlights\nmultiple strategies in detail!)\nThe simulations are not without criticism. Gareth Collins,\na planetary scientist working\nhere at Imperial, suggests the\npublished findings could be\nmisleading. With a 60-metre-wide rock, very few impacts\ncould kill millions, with the\nmajority killing none. The\naverage is therefore greatly\ninflated by a few exceptional\ncircumstances \u2013 it all depends\non where it lands, Collins\nmaintains: \u201cyou have to put it\nin perspective.\u201d\nA Coolabah forest in the Pilbara region of Western Australia \\\\\nTERN Ausplots\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nH\nere at Imperial,\nany mention\nof divestment\nfrom fossil fuels\nis largely met\nwith one of\ntwo responses. The first is a\nsupportive but disheartened\nreply along the lines of, \u201cyeah,\nit\u2019s a nice idea but it will never\nhappen\u201d. The second offers\na complete aversion to the\nsubject entirely, by changing\nthe topic of conversation. If\nwe are serious about tackling\nclimate change and securing\na safer future for society,\nthis atmosphere of apathy\nneeds to change. This is the\nmotivation behind the Divest\nImperial Campaign, aiming\nto encourage the college to\nstop investing in the fossil fuel\nindustry.\nThe team behind the\ncampaign want to encourage\nopen discussion on divestment\nfor students and staff alike. We\nwant to stop the conversation\nfrom being shut down and\naddress the concerns the\ncampaign provokes. The\nresponses described above\ndon\u2019t come from nowhere and\nthe former in particular has\nsome grounds for scepticism.\nImperial College has \u00a35.4\nmillion out of a \u00a3126 million\nendowment fund directly\ninvested in the fossil industry.\nThis makes Imperial the third-largest UK university investor\nin fossil fuels. The difficulty\nhowever, is that Imperial\nreceives a huge amount\nresearch funding from the\nfossil fuel industry. There are\na large number of people\nworking in the Royal School\nof Mines, for example, whose\nresearch solely depends on\nthis funding.\nHowever, the source of\nresearch funding should not\ndetermine where Imperial\ninvest their funds. It is ludicrous\nto believe that the only reason\nthe fossil fuel industry gives\nmoney to Imperial is because\nImperial then re-invest back\ninto fossil fuels. The industry\nprovides funds for their own\nbenefit.\nFossil fuels are becoming\never more difficult to extract\nand process, making the\nindustry increasingly reliant on\nthe results from the research\nthey fund. They also receive\nendless amounts of graduates\nfrom the college year on year.\nThe running joke that there is\na secret tunnel running from\nthe chemical engineering\nbuilding at Imperial to Shell\nheadquarters speaks for itself.\nThe notion of divestment\nat Imperial may seem\ncontroversial, but when it\nis placed next to the stated\nmissions and aims of the\ncollege it becomes a lot\nmore palatable. The college\narmaments firms. At King\u2019s College, the university idled on its\nprevious commitments to divest\nuntil a small group of students\nrapidly amplified pressure on\nthe university earlier this year.\nThe intense campaign culminated in one PhD student,\nRoger Hallam, undergoing a\nhunger strike. Roger\u2019s enormous personal commitment\ndidn\u2019t go unnoticed and after\n14 days the university reaffirmed its commitment and\nagreed to a full divestment\nwithin five years.\nThe momentum in the UK for\ndivestment is clearly proceeding in one direction: a situation\nwhere our universities, some of\nthe most respected institutions\nin the world, come together\nto take a coherent and constructive stand against the\nenvironmental destruction\nperpetrated by the fossil fuel\nindustry. With 13 of its 24 members holding some commitment,\ndivestment is becoming the\nnorm within the Russell Group,\nas well as in London where\neight major universities in the\ncapital have already commit-ted. For Imperial to maintain its\nwell-deserved reputation as an\ninstitution tackling global chal-lenges, fossil fuel divestment\nmust be a question of 'when'\nrather than 'if'.\n\\\\ If we are serious\nabout tackling\nclimate change and\nsecuring a safer\nfuture for society,\nthis atmosphere of\napathy at Imperial\nneeds to change \\\\\n\\\\ The source of\nresearch funding\nshould not\ndetermine where\nImperial invest their\nfunds \\\\\n\\\\ We want to stop\nthe conversation\nfrom being shut\ndown and address\nthe concerns the\nthat campaign\nprovokes \\\\\nstate their \u201cmission is to\nachieve enduring excellence\nin research and education\nin science\u2026 for the benefit\nof society.\u201d Is there anything\nmore beneficial to society\nthan taking action on climate\nchange? Yet by investing\nin fossil fuels, the college\nseems to be doing the\nopposite. Burning fossil fuels\nis the leading cause of climate\nchange and once they\u2019re out\nof the ground I doubt they\nwill be doing anything other\nthan being burnt. The college\nfurther states that it \u201caims\u2026 to\naddress science challenges of\ntoday and the future\u201d. Fossil\nfuel companies are known\nfunders of climate change\ndenialism and inaction, as well\nas committing countless human\nrights abuses. To effectively\naddress the challenges of\ntoday and the future, Imperial\nmust stop investing in this\nindustry by simply applying\ntheir aims and mission to their\ninvestment policy.\nAs a finite resource, fossil\nfuels will inevitably not be\naround forever and only serve\nas a short-term solution to\ngrowing energy consumption.\nAs Imperial aims to \u201cempower\ngraduates\u2026 to contribute\nto the long-term needs of\nsociety\u201d, we welcome our\ncollege to follow through on\nthis commitment.\nImperial are getting left\nbehind as many other UK\nuniversities, such as King\u2019s\nCollege, are now committed\nto divestment in fossil fuels.\nThe divestment campaign is\ncontinuing to play a vital role\nin encouraging Imperial to\ncatch up.

Where\ntraditional political methods\nhave failed, divestment is now\nmaking serious progress on\nuniversity campuses, in city\nhalls, and financial institutions\naround the world.\nThe global divestment commitment by universities now\nstands at \u00a3540 billion and the\nUK\u2019s institutions alone account\nfor over \u00a310 billion of this. A\nsurge in divestment movements\nin the last two years now means\n49 universities in the UK, more\nthan a third of the total, have\ncommitted to divest from fossil\nfuels. This jump towards a serious statement on fossil fuels by\nour most respected institutions\nis thanks in large part to the\nmany vocal and committed\nstudent movements that began\nacross the country in 2013.\nIt was in Glasgow in late\n2014 that fossil fuel divest-ment gained its foothold in the\nUK. After a year of student\ncampaigning the university\ncommitted to divesting the\n\u00a318 million of assets which it\nheld in the fossil fuel industry,\nmaking it the first in the UK to\ndo so. In the months preceding Glasgow\u2019s decision, SOAS\nhad frozen all of its fossil fuel\ninvestments, and eventually\ndivested its \u00a31.5 million six\nmonths later making it the first\nfossil-free university in London.\n\\\\ In the past, divestment\nhas achieved meaningful\npolitical change and is a\ntestament to the strength of\nstudent activism here in the\nUK \\\\\nThis rapid mobilisation of students to call for divestment\nwould be very familiar to students of previous generations.\nIn the 1970s and \u201880s, the\nUK\u2019s campuses were awash\nwith protests against the apartheid government of South\nAfrica where segregation of\nblack and white citizens was\nenforced at every level of life\nby the state. In response, the\nNational Union of Students,\nsupported by individual unions,\ncalled for a systematic divest-ment from the South African\neconomy.\nIn the UK, there were obvious targets for the campaign\nand the NUS concentrated\non Barclays Bank. To begin\nwith, students divested at a\npersonal level, moving their\nbank accounts and boycotting\nBarclays. In the first two years\nof the campaign, Barclays lost\n10% of its market share in\nstudent accounts, a product\nseriously valued by retail bank-ers. Over the next few years\nBarclays would gradually\ndivest from specific projects in\nSouth Africa which had been\nrepeatedly targeted by campaigners in the UK and the U.S.\nWhen Barclays eventually\nsold their South African division in 1986, its chairman\nSir Timothy Bevan admitted\nthat \u201cworld opinion counts. It\naffects commerce, and world\nopinion has changed a lot this\nyear\u201d. Barclays had pulled\n\u00a3200 million from South\nAfrica, and became the first\nof many British companies\nto divest from the South African economy, although many\naround the world, especially in\nthe U.S. had already done so.\nFinancial markets welcomed\nthe change of direction, seen\nby this point as inevitable for\nany public company with significant positions in South Africa,\nand Barclays\u2019 share price\nenjoyed a modest increase following the announcement.\nThe global divestment movement against apartheid was\ncertainly significant in placing\nthe political pressure on the\nSouth African government\nwhich eventually pushed them\ninto negotiations in the early\n1990s. In this way, divestment\nhad achieved meaningful political change and the campaign\nis a testament to the strength of\nstudent activism here in the UK.\nWhile the current divest-ment movement has serious\nmomentum at present, campus\ncampaigns in the UK face significant challenges. Most of our\nuniversities not only hold investments in the fossil fuel industry\nthrough their endowments but\nalso receive funding directly\nfrom the industry through individual departments. The fossil\nfuel industry relies on universities to provide large amounts\nof intellectual and human capital through each new cohort\nof graduates, as well as the\nresearch needed to extract and\nprocess fossil fuels in ever-more\ndifficult and harmful ways.\nActivists have met these challenges head on and a variety\nof tactics have been employed\nin campaigns across the UK so\nfar. The University of Edinburgh\nagreed to a partial divestment\nin 2016, moving its money\nout of three companies with\nactivities in coal and tar sands\noil, considered to be the most\nharmful of fossil fuel depos-its. Even this partial decision\nwas only taken after a 10-day\noccupation of Edinburgh\u2019s\nfinance offices by a group of\n20 students. A year later, disappointed in the university's\naversion to a full divestment,\na larger group went into an\novernight occupation of the\nuniversity quad. A small group\nof students were singled out\nfor disciplinary action and the\noccupation was cut short, but\nthe Edinburgh campaign continues in earnest.\nA similar position was taken in\n2015 at Oxford, who hold the\nsecond largest endowment in\nthe UK. The university stopped\nshort of full divestment but\nmade a commitment to divest\nfrom coal and tar sands. In\nresponse, 70 prominent alumni\nhanded back their degrees and\nthe fossil free campaign continues towards fulls divestment. In\nlate 2015, Warwick agreed to\na full divestment in only one\nyear. This was followed by\ndivestment announcements\nfrom UAL, Surrey, Oxford\nBrookes and Sheffield. The following year, full commitments\nwere made by Queen Mary,\nSt. Andrews and Bristol while\npartial commitments came\nfrom Southampton, Newcastle\nand Cambridge.\nHere in London, Imperial\nis quickly being left to play\ncatch-up up with our neigh-bours. At the London School\nof Economics a year-long\nstudent campaign led to a\nfull divestment commitment in\n2015. Alongside all fossil fuels,\nLSE also agreed to divest from\n\\\\ Imperial is\nbeing left to play\ncatch up with our\nneighbours \\\\\n\\\\ Most of our\nuniversities hold\ninvestments in the\nfossil fuel industry\nthrough their\nendowments but\nalso receive funding\ndirectly from the\nindustry \\\\\n\n"

Adapted\nfrom Nikolai Leskov\u2019s 1865\nnovel Lady Macbeth of the\nMtsensk, writer Alice Birch\nand director William Oldroyd\ntranspose the setting to\nVictorian Yorkshire, trapping\ntheir characters in a bleak\nand unrelenting world,\ndetermined to impose itself\non those contained within its\ngrasp.\nFlorence Pugh, as Katherine,\nis fantastically controlled yet\nexpressive. Lady Macbeth is\nat its funniest and best when\nshe displays her myriad of\nquerulous and defiant faces,\nhinting none too subtly to the\nmen that bought, control, and\npatronise her where they can\nstick it. Yet Pugh\u2019s acting is\nmuch more complete, as she\nshows not only Katherine\u2019s\ndetermination to get what she\nwants, namely Cosmo Jarvis\u2019s\nSebastian, but also the fear\nand anger that drives her\nto commit ever more drastic\nacts to keep him. Pugh allows\nKatherine\u2019s subversive nature\nto pierce through the 19th\ncentury decorum, bringing\nenergy whenever she\u2019s on the\nscreen, and sparks whenever\nshe\u2019s spoiling for a fight.\nSebastian embodies the\ntrope that the best way to\nget laid in Victorian England\nwas to be a handsome and\nhulking farm hand. By this\nmetric, Jarvis is eminently\nsuitable for the role, though\nhe does have some acting\nchops too. He conveys well\nthe line Sebastian walks\nbetween raffish and danger-ous, and his later descent into\nemotional confliction. Yet, for\nall this, Sebastian never feels\nworth the lengths and effort\nKatherine goes to to keep\nhim. More convincing reasons\narrive in the form of her new\nhusband (Paul Hilton) and\nher father-in-law (Christopher\nFairbank). The first feeble and\nthe second menacing, they\nfrom a controlling pair whose\nattempted vice-like grip on\nKatherine gives her ample\nopportunity to fight back, as\nshe throws off their insistence\nshe \u201csit inside with her prayer\nbook\u201d. Many of the other\ncharacters are caught in the\nentailing crossfire, most notably the maid Anna (Naomi\nAckie) and young Teddy\n(Anton Palmer).\nAri Wegner\u2019s arresting\ncinematography provides\na rich and alluring texture,\nin the process proving that\nbrown, with its many and various hues and shades, need\nnot be a dull colour. Here it\nexacerbates the claustrophobic effect of the walls, locking\nKatherine in, and highlighting\nhow society restricts her. Lady\nMacbeth uses this to show the\nrelationships between choice\nand power, as well as control\nand resistance, and explore a\nmuch larger scope, examining\nthe line between asserting\nyour owns freedoms and\nabusing those of others.\nA\nyoung Korean\nwoman arrives\nat a vast\nmansion, taking\nup position as\nhandmaiden\nto the niece of a wealthy\naristocrat. So begins this erotic,\npsychological thriller, a taut\nand captivating exploration of\ndeceit, power, and sexuality\nin Japanese-ruled Korea. The\nlatest film from director Park\nChan-Wook, who brought us the\nuber-violent neo-noir Oldboy, he\nsmashes the ball out of the park\nonce again.\nLoosely adapted from Sarah\nWaters\u2019 novel Fingersmith, the\nfilm plunges us into a world\nbrimming with lies, love, and\nbetrayal; we are forced to\nsecond-guess the motives of\neach and every character. In\nmany ways this is a heist movie,\nthe target nominally a vast\nfortune, but in reality the control\nof the game, as the characters\nlead each other (as well as the\naudience) on a merry dance of\nhoodwinking and power plays.\nEach character has their own\ndesires, strengths, and shortcom-ings, but Park never quite lets\nus fully grasp what these truly\nare. The resulting uncertainty\nkept me hooked; as my entire\nunderstanding of the power\ndynamics was liable to invert\nat a moment's notice, I found\nmyself unable to look away, or\nfor my mind to wander. What\u2019s\nmore remarkable was how at\neach moment the reality I was\nbeing presented with seemed\ninevitable and incontrovertible,\nonly to be dashed and reshaped\nscene after scene, a remarkable\nfeat of storytelling.\nThis control over story progression is matched by the absolute\nprecision of the camerawork.\nIt allows the film to convey\nnot only the ominous feel of\nunfolding events and apparent\ncalamities, but to enhance and\nelevate this overarching inevita-bility. The set design is similarly\nimmaculate, often seeming to\nreflect the status of characters\noccupying them \u2013 sometimes\nsmall and strapping, at others\nexpansive and powerful. The\noverall visual effect is wonderful,\na powerful evocation of mood,\ndrawing out reactions in a visceral fashion.\nSex scenes are notoriously\ndifficult to pull off, usually either\nlacking frisson or descending\ninto self -parody. This is prevalent even in films centred around\nsexuality, notably in Abdellatif\nKechiche\u2019s 2013 Blue is the\nWarmest Colour, a sex-based\nbildungsroman which presented\nitself as an exploration and\nevocation of desire, but ended\nup as an excuse for the director\nto conjure up a 3-hour reel of\nhis lesbian fantasies \u2013 That it\ntakes itself so seriously gives a\nfilm an inadvertently funny spin,\nand not in a good way. For The\nHandmaiden however, Park\nChan-Wook overwhelmingly\ngets the balance right, with only\na few moments held on for too\nlong, or burning too bright.\nThe Handmaiden is a rare\nbeast \u2013 thrilling, yet thoughtful.\nIt has lingered in my mind long\nsince I saw it, and is a film very\nmuch worth watching. Brought\nto life by a combination of taut\nwriting, precise directing and\nnuanced acting, it breathes a\ncinematic life that is at once\ncharismatic yet subtle, entrancing yet restrained.\nA tale of deceit and desire \\\\ Allstar/\nAmazon Studios\nThe Handmaiden\nBy Lawrence Good\nW\ni\nt\nh\nh\nis\ns\ni\nx\nt\nh\nf\ni\nl\nm\nc\no\nm\ni\nn\ng\no\nu\nt later this year, there is no stopping Dola\nn\n\u2019\ns\no\nu\nt\np\nu\nt\n\\\n\\\nG\ne\no\nr\ng\nes\nB\ni\na\nr\nd\n/\nC\nr\ne\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nC\no\nm\nm\no\nn\ns\nthe street, who you might\ntalk to everyday. For instance,\nit is Dolan in I Killed My\nMother, playing a teen\nlooking for himself; or it is\nDolan in Heartbeats, chasing\nhis crush; and it is also Dolan\nin Tom at the Farm, who\nrecently lost his lover. I think\nthe trouble with his movies\nbegins here: Dolan wants us\nto identify with his characters\nso much that they become\narchetypes, emptied of\npersonality so that we can fill\nin the void with our own emo-tions. The way Dolan builds\nhis characters is symptomatic\nof this: he collects pictures of\nclothes, atmospheres, hair-cuts, and together they define\na character\u2019s personality. It is\nat this point that people start\nto call his work easy, clich\u00e9\u2026\nThe third part is that emotions are achieved through\nmusic. My absolute favourite\nfeature of his films, music\nis the main reason I am\nfascinated by his work. Like\nin many other movies, music\nchoice is used to signify emo-tions, but Dolan pushes this\nto an extreme: he is known\nto have written some scripts\nliterally from music that has\ninspired him. More than any\nother director I know, the\ntunes literally tell you how to\nfeel; everything is focused on\nthe music, which is sometimes\nextremely loud compared to\nthe rest of the soundtrack. An\nobvious example of this is the\ndream sequence featured in\nMommy \u2013 as soon as it starts,\nthe tone is set by violins: we\nneed to be sad, right now.\nBut what I love most is that he\nhas the most amazing music\nchoices, which have been\ndescribed as \u201cshameless\u201d:\nO-Zone\u2019s Dragostea Din Tei,\nOasis\u2019 Wonderwall, Eiffel\n65\u2019s Blue (Da Ba Dee), along\nwith lesser-known acts such\nas The Knife or Moderat. If,\nwhen reading one of these\ntitles, you thought they were\nclich\u00e9 or had been heard\na million times, you are\nperfectly right; but when you\nwatch it, they sound great,\nbuilding insane climaxes, and\nmakes the scene memorable\nin the best way.\nThis result is in part made\npossible by the final element\nof Dolan\u2019s technique: emotions are achieved through\nthe use of specific effects serving aesthetic choices. And\nthis gets to the core of what\nannoys many people: Dolan\nuse of technique to get results\ncan hardly be described as\nsubtle. He uses these techniques many times in his\nwork, and even within\nthe same movie, to the\npoint they become\ngimmicks through\nrepetition; he even\npushes that use further\nby layering them on top\nof one another: too much\nis never enough.\nHis most divisive choice \u2013\nbut also the most beautiful I\nthink \u2013 is in Mommy. At one\nenough.\nIn the end, I think these four\nelements (and combinations\nthereof) are what makes a\nDolan movie. The popular\nquality of these stories and\ncharacters, together with\nmusic associated with specific\neffects create climaxes and\nmemorable scenes. But can\u2019t\nwe describe pretty much any\nmovie with this? Probably,\nbut it is the way Dolan uses\nthem that makes his movies\nstand out: he magnifies and\nexaggerates them, and it is\nthis accumulation of effects,\nand his gimmicky use of\nthem, that is truly the essence\nof his movies. His favourite\ncombination of effects is\nslow motion and music, with\nsometimes the picture being\nblurred: this combination is\nliterally always present in\nhis movies. I think it is this\naccumulation people do not\nlike: too clich\u00e9, too easy, too\ngratuitous. In fact, too constructed and yet, too simple\nto be real. Artificial\nemotions.\nIs that really what\nit is? While I felt this\nway the first time I\nwatched one of his\nmovies, Mommy, I\nslowly came to realise\nit is in fact the oppo-site. Dolan is young\nand has many things\nto say, so much that he\nmust say them before it is\ntoo late. And this accumulation of effects is, I think, the\nway he chooses to do this:\nhe saturates the picture with\neffects in order to saturate it\nwith emotions; with his repetitive use of slow motion, he\nliterally slows down the time;\nthere is always this urgency\nto say the most in the least\namount of time, to move us,\nto make us remember. To do\nso, he uses popular themes to\ntouch as many people as pos-sible, to make us as close as\npossible to what is happening\non the screen. He says it him-self: all his characters \u201chave\nthe same identity problems.\nThey\u2019re looking for them-selves, for a place in society.\nThey\u2019re misfits trying to fit in.\nThey often love someone who\ndoesn\u2019t love them back.\u201d\nSome people think Dolan is\ntrying too hard at this, with\neverything so thoroughly\nconstructed to move us that\nthe result is we do not wish\nto be moved anymore. But\nwhat if we chose to let him\nmove us? And to me, this is\nwhat popular art is about: to\nreference Dolan\u2019s favourite\nmovie, Titanic, what would it\nbe without C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s (in)\nfamous song \u2018My Heart Will\nGo On\u2019? Would it have the\nsame fame? Probably not,\nand I this is what makes it\nbeautiful. This is what Dolan\nis trying to achieve with his\nextremely popular art, and I\nthink he succeeds. The truth is,\nXavier Dolan\u2019s movies are to\ncinema what pop is to music.\nAnd that is amazing.\npoint in the movie, the characters suddenly feel a fresh air\nof hope, contrasting from the\nheavy atmosphere they (and\nwe) felt before. To signify this,\nDolan slowly opens the screen\nratio\nfrom the oppressing 1:1 we\nhad since the beginning to a\nwider 1.85:1, bringing some\nwelcome relief. But that is not\nall: the widening is signified\nwithin the movie by Steve, the\nprotagonist, opening wide his\narms in front of the camera\nas a sign of freedom, the\nratio of the movie following\nSteve\u2019s hands as they move\n(or, rather, Steve effectively\nopening the ratio with his\nhands). On top of that, all\nthis happens in slow-motion\nwith Wonderwall playing.\nAs I said, too much is never\n.\n.\n.\nt\nh\nr\no\nu\ng\nh\nto\nthrillers full of concealment and danger..\n.\n\\\n\\\nN\ne\nt\nw\no\nr\nk\nF\nil\nm\ns\n.\n.\n.\na\nn\nd\ni\nn\ne\nv\ni\nt\na\nb\nl\ny\nr\ne\nv\nolving around themes of family, conf\nlict, an\nd\ne\nm\no\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n.\n\\\n\\\nC\nu\nr\nz\no\nn\nF\ni\nl\nm\ns\nD\no\nl\na\nn\n\u2019\ns\nw\no\nr\nk\ns\np\na\nn\ns\nd\nramas of young romance and heartbreak..\n.\n\\\n\\\nI\nF\nC\nF\ni\nl\nm\ns\n\n"

Many have a\ntrack record of human rights\nabuses and environmental\nlapses that would embarrass\neven the most hardened\ndictator.\nTake, for example, Royal\nDutch Shell (better known\nsimply as Shell). For many\nyears, Shell has conducted\ndrilling operations in the\nNiger River delta region in\nNigeria. Since around 15BC,\nthe Ogoni people have lived\nand worked on this land;\nthe arrival of Shell in the\n1950s, however, turned the\nold order upside down.

After\nall, 85% of Nigeria\u2019s oil\nwealth has benefited the top\n1% of the population, with\n70% of the country living\non less than a dollar a day.\n\\\\ The company\nfocusses soley\non itself and\nprofits ahead of\nenvironmental or\ncriminal issues \\\\\nThe money, just like the oil,\nwas flowing straight out of\nNigeria. In response to the\nOgoni peoples\u2019 protests, Shell\nwere ruthless, hiring members\nof the Nigerian military as a\nprivate defence force. Raids\non villages in the area saw\nresidents tortured, raped, and\nexecuted in brutal fashion,\nin an effort to discourage\nresistance to Shell\u2019s expansion.\nAll the while, Shell continued\nto employ the military, and as\nrecently as 2010 was found\nto have paid an armed militia\n$159,000 to protect its oil\ninfrastructure.\nUnfortunately, Shell\u2019s\nrecord is far from unusual in\nthe sector. ExxonMobil, until\nrecently under the leadership\nof US Secretary of State\nRex Tillerson, offers another\ndepressingly similar example.\nThe parallels are uncanny;\nsubstitute Ogoniland in\nNigeria for Aceh in Indonesia,\nand the story is pretty much\nunchanged. Members of the\nIndonesian military acting on\nbehalf of Mobil (pre-merger)\nare alleged to have committed\nabuses of nightmarish sadism:\nshooting protesters in their\nkneecaps, administering\nelectric shocks to their genitals,\nand even threatening them\nwith pits of human heads.\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough,\nExxonMobil\u2019s story has\nanother dark chapter. Recent\ninvestigations have revealed\nthat Exxon scientists were\namong the first to realise\nthe implications of rising\ncarbon dioxide levels, with\nsome reports suggesting that\ntheir research indicated a\nwarming planet as early as\nthe 1950s. To their credit,\nthe scientists insisted on the\npublication of their findings\nand Exxon acquiesced; by\nthe mid-80s however, with\nthe oil price falling, Exxon\u2019s\nmanagement performed a\nbreathtaking U-turn. Over the\nnext decades, Exxon became\none of the most prolific\nfunders of climate-sceptics,\nin a desperate attempt to\nundermine the research of their\nown scientists. Had it not been\nfor their intellectual dishonesty\nand anti-scientific cowardice,\nwho knows how much closer\nwe\u2019d be to addressing climate\nchange.\nImperial also has investments\nin a company which employs\nover 100,000 people, has\nrevenue of around $50\nbillion each year and is worth\nmore than McDonalds. It\nhas consistently kept a low\nprofile, due to it not owning\nany oilfields, excluding it from\nthe Guardians divestment\nlist, from the \u2018Keep it in the\nground\u2019 campaign. Yet this\ncompany works with every\nmajor oil company to extract\nthe oil from the ground. The\ncompany is Schlumberger and\nis far from a moral one.\nIn 2015 it was found that\nSchlumberger had employed\nstaff working in the US and\nother US citizens to work on\ncontracts in Sudan and Iran,\nsomething not allowed by US\nlaw. To prevent authorities\nuncovering this, the countries\nwere referred to as \u201cSouthern\nEgypt\u201d (Sudan) and the\n\u201cNorthern Gulf\u201d (Iran). This\nwas eventually uncovered\nand the company were dealt\na $233 million criminal fine,\nthe largest in US history for\nsanctions violations. The\ncompany had been dealt a\nlight blow in comparison to\nthe size of the company, and\non receipt of the fine its shares\nrose 2%.\nSchlumberger still\noperates today in some of\nthe most challenging areas\nsuch as Burma, Libya and\nTurkmenistan. Simultaneously\nbeing self-aware of the issues,\na recent company memo\nclaimed that corruption in\nTurkmenistan is not as bad as\nin Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan \u2013\nnot exactly reassuring. Clearly\nthe company focusses solely\non itself and profits ahead\nof environmental or criminal\nissues.\nAlternatively, one may\nlook at our own President\u2019s\nappointment to the board\nof directors of Chevron. The\ncompany is the second largest\noilcompanyinAmericabehind\nExxonMobil, and in recent\nyears has been involved in a\nbitter environmental dispute\nin Ecuador, at one point\nlobbying the US government\nto impose trade restrictions on\nthe country so that the lawsuit\nwould be dropped. The case\nbegan in 1993 and continues\nto this day, overshadowing\nother controversies including\nan oil spill in 2011 off the\ncoast of Brazil in which over\n400,000 litres were spilt, and\nan oil rig explosion in 2012\nin which two workers were\nkilled.\nHypocritically, the company\nthen launched a \u2018Real Issues\u2019\ncampaign designed to aid\ndiscussion of the important\nissues in the energy industry.\nThey did this through a \u2018Will\nyou join us?\u2019 forum \u2013 a clear\nattempt at greenwashing,\nas their CEO recently stated\nthat he doesn\u2019t agree with\nthe policies intended to be\nimplemented by the Paris\nClimate Accord. Presumably\nthe company wants to retain a\nhigh level of output of oil and\ngas into the future as the world\nattempts to turn to renewables.\nCollectively, shares in\nShell, ExxonMobil and\nSchlumberger comprise\nnearly half of Imperial\u2019s\ntotal fossil fuel investments,\nwhile Imperial\u2019s chummy\nrelationship with Chevron is\nembodied in our very own\nPresident. All parties seem to\nbe able to agree on one thing:\nthey\u2019d much rather we didn\u2019t\nlook too closely at their murky\npast.\n\\\\ All parties seem to be\nable to agree on one thing:\nthey\u2019d much rather we didn\u2019t\nlook too closely at their\nmurky past \\\\\n\n"

    "content": "EUROVISSUE\nEUROVISSUE\nT\nhere\u2019s a common\nmisconception\nthat Eurovision\nbegan solely as\na way to reunite\nthe bruised and\nbattered Europe after\nthe Second World War.\nThis may be the reason\nthat it was so successful,\nand to this day is the\nlargest entertainment\nshow on Earth, but the\ntrue sentiment behind its\nconception is rather more\ngeeky.\nThe first Eurovision Song\nContest took place in\n1956 at the suggestion of\nSergio Pugliese from an\nItalian television station,\nwho wanted to take the\nItalian Sanremo Music Festival and expand it to test\nthe limits of live broadcast\ntelevision. The first contest\nwas in Switzerland, with\nseven countries taking\npart, and the challenge\nwas to have seven different television networks in\nseven countries simultaneously broadcasting\nthe same program. Of\ncourse, the European\nBroadcasting Union used\nthe excuse of bringing a\nwar-torn Europe together\nas an excuse for their\nexperiment.\nTo compete, a national\ntelevision network must\nbe an active member of\nthe European Broadcasting Union, located in the\nrange of broadcast of the\nEBU, or being a member\nstate of the Council of\nEurope, and jump through\nseveral hoops such as ensuring that it will be broadcast\nto 98% of their country, they\nbroadcast the previous year\u2019s\nshow, and of course, that they\npaid the fee. The television\nstations each have different\nways of determining their\nentry, although by now most\ncountries host X-Factor style\nshows to decide their contestant (probably as a way of\nwringing more money out of\nviewers in votes).\nThe numbers of participating countries grew gradually\neach year. After the Second\nWorld War, a contest that\nunified Europe and had\nthemes of love and peace\nwas popular and it became\nwildly successful. Following\nthe Soviet dissolution and the\nend of the Cold War in 1991,\nthere was a sharp increase in\nthe number of participating\ncountries to 43 countries participating in 2008 and 2011,\nand similar numbers taking\npart in the subsequent years.\nThe only European countries\nthat have never participated\nin Eurovision are Liechtenstein, Vatican City and\nKosovo, although all countries\nbut Germany have failed to\nparticipate at least once since\n1956, for reasons ranging\nbetween a form of political\nprotest to simply not being\nable to afford it. The winning\nnation must be able to host\nthe contest the following year,\non top of their participation\nfees, the possibility of which\nhas ruled out entries by many\nnations at different points in\ntime.\nTo celebrate the sixtieth\nanniversary of Eurovision,\nAustralia were invited to\ntake part in Eurovision 2015\nas a one-off, as a nod to\nthe popularity of the Song\nContest down under. They\nwere given an automatic spot\nin the final and came fifth\noverall, with Guy Sebastian\u2019s\nTonight Again, a clear nod to\nEuropop with in composition\nand staging. Australia were\nso popular that it was decided\nthat they would be allowed to\nreturn in the subsequent year,\nbut would not be given an\nautomatic place in the final. In\n2016, Dani Im\u2019s The Sound Of\nSilence propelled them into\nsecond place, and Europe\u2019s\nlove for their Oceanic cousins\ndoes not seem to be waning.\nEven if Australia were to\nwin the Eurovision Song\nContest, it wouldn\u2019t be hosted\noutside Europe. One special\ncondition of Australia\u2019s participation is that they agree to\nco-host the contest in Europe\nif they are to win \u2013 if they win\nthis year, they will probably\nco-host with Germany for\n2018. The novelty of Australia\nstill seems to be strong even\namong the most traditional\nEurovision fans, and Australia\u2019s don\u2019t seem to be on trend\nto be any less successful this\nyear.\n2017 was set to be the first\nyear to reach 44 participants,\nbut with Russia having pulled\nout of this year\u2019s competition as their performer was\nnot granted permission to\ntravel to Ukraine for the\ncompetitions, and Bosnia and\nHerzegovina being forced to\nwithdraw due to the financial\nstate of their national television station, only 42 countries\nwere eligible to hold a place\nA potted guide to Eurovision history\n\\\\ Eurovision\nis about way\nmore than the\nmusic, it\u2019s about\nusing your\nvote to express\nfriendship\nand political\napproval (or\ndisapproval) \\\\\nI once had the misfortune of watching Eurovision with only an Argentinian, a Mexican, and a\nLebanese for company. If you\u2019re not European (or Australian, apparently), Eurovision seems to\nbe very confusing and completely un-understandable. For us Europeans, either on the mainland\nor stuck on little islands, it\u2019s the defining feature that we all have in common. How is it possible to\nnot feel affectionately towards the brutal political performing, voting and shunning, the drunken\ntelevisionhosts,anddodgyEuro-fashion,andthecampperformanceswiththepotentialtobankrupt\nthe hosting nation? Responsible for this mental breakdown is Tessa Davey // All images eurovision.tv\nin the final.\nOf these, all but the Big\nFive (France, Germany,\nItaly, Spain, and the\nUnited Kingdom, who are\nthe biggest financial contributors to the European\nBroadcasting Union, and\nthus are automatically\ngiven a place in the final)\nand the host nation had to\nbattle it out for a place in\nthe final at the two semi-fi-nals/elaborate excuses for\na tech rehearsal that took\nplace on Tuesday and\nThursday.\nThe winners are decided\nby votes from all the\nother countries, with one\nto twelve points being\nawarded. With this in\nmind, it pays to be good\nfriends with your neigh-bours. Eurovision is about\nway more than the music,\nit\u2019s about using your vote\nto express friendship and\npolitical approval (or\ndisapproval). Scandinavia\nand the Balkan bloc are\nvery good at awarding\ntheir douze points to their\nown, but the UK doesn\u2019t\ntend to do so well. Ireland\nand Malta are usually\nour friends, but thanks to\nour sometimes questionable political decisions\nand tenuous relationship\nwith Europe, our scores\nsuffer. Two months after\nthe invasion of Iraq, the\nUK was awarded a grand\ntotal of null points across\nthe whole competition, a\nfeat that occurs only very\nrarely.\nEUROVISSUE\n\\\\ Eurovision\nis about way\nmore than the\nmusic, it\u2019s about\nusing your\nvote to express\nfriendship\nand political\napproval (or\ndisapproval) x\n2 \\\\\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s chances\nThis year, with Brexit looming,\nmany European countries are\nanything but our best friends.\nEven Theresa May has been\nreported as joking that she\ndoesn\u2019t think that we will get\nmany points this year. It seems\nthat as well as ruining our\ncountry, she wants to ruin our\nchances at Eurovision too. But\nyou never know, we\u2019re fairly\nobviously in dire straights with\na snap election being called,\nso maybe we\u2019ll get some pity\npoints and do slightly better\nthan usually. We can\u2019t really\ndo any worse.\nRussia\nLet\u2019s address the huge elephant in the room in this year\u2019s\nEurovision: Russia\u2019s absence\nfrom the contest held in Kiev,\nUkraine. The Russian entry,\nYulia Samoylova, was banned\nfrom entering Ukraine after\ntouring Crimea in 2015. Each\nparticipant is organised by the\nrespective television stations\nin each country, and Russia\u2019s\nchannel One turned down\nsuggestions that they have\nher perform remotely, or\nGod forbid, that they pick\nanother representative\nthat would be granted\nentry to Ukraine. Instead,\nthey chose to withdraw\nfrom the contest entirely,\nsaying that she will\ninstead represent Russia\nin next year\u2019s competi-tion. Instead, on the day\nof one of the semi-finals,\nshe performed in Crimea\nin an act of defiance.\nThe winning 2016 entry\nfrom Ukraine\u2019s Jamala\nabout the deportation\nof the Crimean Tatars\nby the Soviet Union was\nundoubtedly fantastic, but\nwe can\u2019t deny that the fact\nit won the Eurovision Song\nContest was anything\nbut a political statement.\nIndeed, Russia took it per-sonally, and threatened to\nboycott the next year\u2019s contest\nin protest. With all of Europe\nchoosing this entry as the win-ners, I can\u2019t imagine they felt\nvery welcome.\nEurovision tends to be a\ncontest of openness, shown\nno better than when drag\nqueen Conchita Wurst rose\nlike a phoenix to win the 2014\ncompetition. Russia\u2019s anti-gay\nstance tends to bring protests\nfrom crowds at the Eurovision\n2017|\nSPECIAL\nso scandalous\nso scandalous\nso scandalous\nso scandalous\nso scandalous\nso scandalous\nso scandalous\nfinals, who feel like this kind\nof discrimination goes against\nthe spirit of Eurovision. This\nyear Russia has had a huge\nmedia storm regarding its anti-gay laws, with reports coming\nin the last month of gay men\nbeing detained and executed\nsystematically in Chechnya.\nMaybe, in the spirit of Eurovision, they really are better\nsitting this one out.\nLanguage\nIn the early days of Eurovision, songs were required to\nbe performed in their national\nlanguage. Since 1999, there\nhas been no restriction on the\nlanguage that songs can be\nperformed in, which has lead to\nlarge numbers of songs being\nsung in English or French, which\ntends to increase the score due\nto their lyrics being understood\nby a larger number of viewers.\nHowever, Eurovision purists,\nand some countries, still prefer\nperformances in their national\nlanguage. But the numbers\nare dropping off, with the\ngeneral trend being all countries moving towards English\nperformances \u2013 even France\nwho have faced protests in the\npast when their entrant has\nsung in any other language.\nOnly Portugal, Hungary, and\nBelarus have entries that are\nnot at least partially in English.\nFrance\nBut why are France singing in\nEnglish? Well, it\u2019s actually not\nentirely out of choice. France\nnearly faced disqualification\nthis year when it emerged\nthat their song Requiem was\nperformed as far back as\nDecember 2015, long before\nit was submitted as their Eurovision entry. This breaks the\nrules, but France have got\naround it by using a bilingual\nversion of the same song with\nan English chorus. This difference is enough to keep them\nsafe, although is it worth the\ncost to their gallic pride?\n\n"

Just like\nany good story, it\nstarts with a nice\n(by British standards anyway)\nspring day with my best\nfriend telling me that she\u2019s\npregnant.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cPeople get pregnant all the\ntime!\u201d While that may be\ntrue, she is not a 30 year-old\nmarried woman. She\u2019s not\neven in a stable relationship.\nIn fact she is just like me, a\nfresher. I don\u2019t know about\nyou but I just didn\u2019t see it\ncoming, despite her having\nbeen in a happy relationship\nwith her boyfriend for quite a\nwhile.\nHow can you fall so hard\nfor someone that safety goes\nout the window? How does\na smart girl get talked into\nnot using condoms? How can\nanyone even be with a prick\nwho \u201cdoesn\u2019t like condoms\u201d?\nAnd then when the shit eventually hits the fan, how can\nsomeone be so unprepared to\ndeal with the aftermath?\nI don\u2019t have the answer\nto these questions. Heck, I\nhadn\u2019t even considered them\nin the first place, which is why\nI was probably even more\nsurprised at finding out than\nshe was. Or maybe because\nshe had already had a day\nor two to process all that\ninformation \u2013 yes, she did tell\nher boyfriend before she told\nme. And yes, if you\u2019re won-dering, the fucking bastard\nimmediately ran away. He\neventually reappeared, but a\nbit too late to be of any help.\nAlas, I digress. Back to my\nfriend.\nShe is a bit broken, but with\na sense of fatalism she\u2019s come\nto accept it. No, she didn\u2019t\nkeep it \u2013 that was never really\na choice for her. That\u2019s not to\nsay it was an easy decision\nto make. The stress alone that\ncame with keeping it from\nher parents, or from anyone\nfor that matter, having to find\na clinic to get the abortion\nbefore going back home, and\neven dealing with exams was\ncrippling.\nIt\u2019s shit and I do feel bad\nfor her, really. But at the\nsame time I\u2019m upset with her\nbecause I still can\u2019t fathom\nhow she could\u2019ve have been\nso naive. I hate badmouthing\nmy friends, but the only thing\nI know about heterosexual\nrelationships is that pulling\nout never works. If I know\nthat, how can someone who\nactually sleeps with men not\napply this in their life?\nThroughout this ordeal, I\u2019ve\nhad no right to express anything but empathy for her and\nI\u2019ve tried to be on her side\nand help her in any way I\ncan. Yet, I\u2019ve had such mixed\nfeelings about the knock-up.\nI\u2019ve never been in danger of\ngetting pregnant myself, so\nI\u2019ve never thought too much\nabout my feelings on abortion\nand contraception, but this\nsingle event has made me\nthink more than I thought I\nwas capable of.\nAnd this is the point when\nthis becomes about me. I\nknow that I shouldn\u2019t make it\nall about my feelings when\nshe obviously felt so much\nmore \u2013 and was certainly\nmore entitled to do so \u2013 but\nfuck it, we need to talk about\nthis. This three-week-long\ndrama made me think a lot\nmore about my opinions on\nreproductive rights. Although\nI knew that this was an issue\nthat people experienced, I\u2019ve\nalways seen both sides of\nthe argument for and against\nabortion, without ever forming an opinion because I\u2019ve\nsimply never had to.\nThrough my friend\u2019s\nunwanted pregnancy I made\nunexpected discoveries about\nmyself. Now, when I feel the\nurge to blame people for their\nmistakes, I know it\u2019s really\njust pointless. Who knows\nhow many times they had sex\nwith or without a condom; it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter either\nway. It could have been\nan isolated incident or it\ncould have been a regular\noccurrence. The end result\nultimately is the same.\nMistakes happen, but we\nshould be responsible for\ndoing all that we can to prevent them.\nI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll compromise her safety again.\nProbably. Hopefully. And\nno one should (you know\nwho you are). Seriously,\nconsider me a slightly less\ncreepy version of the weird\nPE teacher who\u2019s tasked with\ndoing sex ed. It\u2019s your business if you want a child and\nyou are capable of raising it\nalongside your studies, or if\nyou want to drop uni to be\na parent, but still play safe.\nThere are more dramatic\nthings besides an unwanted\npregnancy. Did you know\nthat you can lose your nose\nbecause of syphilis? Google\nit, and you will stack condoms\nin your house forever.\n\\\\ How can you fall\nso hard for someone\nthat safety goes out\nthe window? How\ndoes a smart girl get\ntalked into not using\ncondoms? \\\\\n\\\\ It\u2019s shit and I do\nfeel bad for her, but\nat the same time\nI\u2019m upset because I\ncannot fathom how\nshe could have been\nso naive \\\\\nAndrada Balmez\nOSPITAL\n\\\\ Accidents\nhappen, and people\nget pregnant, and\nmaybe they don\u2019t\nwant to raise a child\nright now, thank you\nvery much \\\\\nI\nhaven\u2019t had an abortion.\nIn fact, I only know two\npeople who have and\nthey personally told me\nof it. One was a girl I\nwent to school with, who\nhad an abortion aged 15,\nand lost a lot of friends who\nhad never realised they were\npro-life until that moment.\nof contraception perfectly.\nPeople miss days, get sick,\nor break condoms. Accidents\nhappen and people get preg-nant, and maybe they don\u2019t\nwant to raise a child right\nnow, thank you. Nonetheless\nthese women exist. But where\nare they?\nWe don\u2019t know who they\nproportional to what we\nhave to lose \u2013 accidents will\nhappen. Whether it\u2019s a slip\nup, or pressure from a horny\nboy who wants to get his\nrocks off bareback, there\nare people walking around\ncampus under the shadow of\nan unexpected pregnancy.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n95% of women who have\nabortions in Britain don\u2019t\nregret them. They\u2019re mostly\nnon-events: early abortions\nare barely any different from\ntaking the morning-after pill,\nbeyond the inconvenience\nof having to make doctor\u2019s\nappointments. Without touching on moral dilemmas,an\nunwanted pregnancy is a\nproblem that needs dealing\nwith. Even in a country where\nabortion has been legal for\nover fifty years, it\u2019s not considered proper to talk about it.\nPeople want you to brush it\naway and hush it up, to deal\nwith it quietly to avoid the\nsting of breaking the taboo.\nOr, because even if they are\npro-choice, they are judging\nyou for getting yourself into\nthis situation.\nWe all take risks when it\ncomes to having sex, whether\nit\u2019s the risk of getting an STI or\ngetting pregnant. Why can\u2019t\nwe think of an unexpected\npregnancy the same as\ngetting chlamydia (which is\nalso unfairly stigmatised, but\nless so)? You can deal with it\nby taking a few pills, so why\nis it any different, even for\nWhy do we stigmatise abortion?\nOne in three women will have an abortion. So where are they?\nthose who don\u2019t see a moral\nproblem with terminating a\npregnancy? Is it traumatic\nbecause there is inherent\nmoral questioning, or is it\ntraumatic because the stigma\nthat surrounds abortion is so\npowerful that you\u2019re almost\nforced to keep it a secret,\ndisabling your support network and inducing feelings of\nshame.\nI don\u2019t know. My only experience with abortion amongst\nmy peers, in what I thought\nwas a very reasonable and\nsensible situation, resulted in\na lot of gossip, broken friend-ships, and hurt feelings. I\u2019ve\nnever come into contact with\nany positive experiences of\nabortion, never met anyone\nwho needed to terminate a\npregnancy and did what they\nhad to do with no negative\nconsequences or regrets, and\nthis is wildly unacceptable\nwhen it\u2019s a thing that around\na third of women will go\nthrough in their lifetime.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this\nway. We don\u2019t have to make\nabortions these huge secrets\nthat we don\u2019t talk about.\nIt\u2019s frustrating and it makes\nme angry that the only\ntime that abortion comes\nup in conversation is in a\nsex-negative context that puts\n\\\\ One in three\nwomen in the\nUK will have an\nabortion during their\nlifetime \\\\\nwomen down. Women who\nunexpectedly get pregnant\nare not any less deserving of\nrespect, they are not stupid,\nthey are not murderers and\nthey are not evil. They are just\nwomen, like you and I, who\nhappen to have undergone a\nstandard medical procedure.\nThe decisions that we make\nconcerning our bodies and\nreproduction should be only\nours to make, and no one\nelse\u2019s to judge.\nAt a time when the right to\nhave full agency over our\nreproduction is not something that women can take\nfor granted; when in Ireland,\nabortion is still illegal, and in\nthe United States access to\nabortion and even contraception has been fought against,\nsilence is unacceptable. Only\nif we talk about it can we\nmaybe address educating\npeople \u2013 teaching girls to be\nassertive about their right to\nsafe sex while teaching everyone to respect their partners\nand be considerate of the\nsubtleties of consent.\nThe more we talk about\nabortion and stop sweeping\nit under the rug, the more we\nnormalise it as something that\nis ultimately a normal part of\nlife. And yeah, maybe we can\nstop being a dick to people\nwho are brave enough to\nadmit they\u2019ve had an abor-tion. That might be nice.\n\\\\ Is it a traumatic\nbecause there is\ninherent moral\nquestioning in an\nabortion, or is it\nbecause the stigma\nthat surrounds\nabortion is so\npowerful? \\\\\n\\\\ It makes me\nangry that the only\ntime abortion comes\nup in conversation\nis in a sex-negative\ncontext that puts\nwomen down \\\\\nThe other is my mother,\nwho speaks about it with\nthe same straightforward\nfrankness with which she\ntalks about close family\ndeaths: as something sad that\nmights have been traumatic\nor difficult at the time, but\nultimately is normal and a\nstandard part of life.\nYou see, one in three\nwomen in the UK will have\nan abortion over the course\nof their lifetime. That\u2019s a lot\nof women. Even if you take\nthe pill religiously, it\u2019s still\nonly 99.9% effective, which\nmeans that on average, one\nwoman in every thousand\ntaking the pill perfectly will\nbecome pregnant over the\ncourse of the year. But let\u2019s be\nreal. No one uses any method\nare because abortion is such\na stigmatised issue that no\none talks about, often not\neven to their closest friends.\nYes, even at Imperial \u2013 where\nwe\u2019re all smart and already\nmaking huge sacrifices for\nour education and we\u2019re\ngoing to take precautions\nTessa Davey\n\n"

    "content": "EUROVISSUE\nEUROVISSUE\nEUROVISSUE\nTHE FINAL | first half\nAustria: Nathan Trent - Running On Air\nFollowing a shameful performance that earned them nul point two years ago, and a strange performance where they sang\nin French last year, Austria have played it more safe this year with the incredibly clean-cut looking Nathan Trent. He\u2019s a\nsneaky one though, because he also reached some of the final stages of the Eurovision selection process for Germany.\nI guess the boy knows what he wants. Dressed all in white (a Eurovision classic) his staging imagines him in the clouds,\nwhere he sings from the moon. Your mum would like him, maybe the rest of Europe will too.\nAzerbaijan: Dihaj - Skeletons\nDespite being relatively new to the Eurovision Song Contest (first performing in 2008), Azerbaijan have a consistent record\nof strong Europop hits, although their scores have dropped off in the last three years. Dihaj were unsuccessful in their\nattempt to represent Azerbaijan in 2011, missing out to overall winners Ell & Nikki. One of the edgier performances in\n2017, you can expect words to be scrawled on a blackboard, and a horse astride a stepladder, the exact meaning of\nwhich is unclear without explanation. The horse represents the bad guy in a relationships, and the ladder the emotional\ndistance from the singer; the collapse of the box is a metaphor for the breakdown of a destructive relationship. It\u2019s an unusual theme that breaks from the tradition of happy-clappy songs about love or peace, or strong political statements, and the\nimagery might be too strong to make this a Eurovision winner. Still, expect some points to be given for the use of a man in a\nhorse mask.\nBelarus: Naviband - Story Of My Life\nBelarus are another of only three performers to sing in their national language. Historyja majho \u017eyccia, or in English, Story\nOf My Life is the first ever Belarusian song to be performed at the Eurovision Song Contest, and the duo Naviband have a\ncharming performance that justifiably earnt them their place in the final. They make strong use of props and costumes, but\ntheir performance feels inexperienced. Belarus have only qualified for the final four times before, so maybe this is the year\nthat they\u2019ll actually do well.\nCroatia: Jacques Houdek - My Friend\nJacques Houdek is already an insanely successful artist, with silver, gold, platinum and diamond albums to his name,\nwho performs a variety of genres from opera to pop. In his impressive entry, he moves effortlessly between these\ngenres at almost each line, demonstrating huge skill. From the deliberate camera work, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that there were two identical performers, each singing the different parts. But there\u2019s not, it\u2019s just Jacques. My\nFriend is not only incredibly skillful, but it is also glorious to watch and to listen to. I would be surprised if the rest of\nEurope doesn\u2019t recognise it as such.\nDenmark: Anja - Where I Am\nAnja Nissen is well known from having won Season 3 of Australia\u2019s The Voice. In fact, she was born and raised in Australia, but is of Danish descent. In the semi-final, she gave a passionate solo performance about letting go, falling to her\nknees as sparks rained around her. This song could be one of dozens of others over the years, but why break away from a\nformula that works? If you can tell the difference between all the female soloists singing about love and loss in this competi-tion, you\u2019re doing better than me.\nArtsvik was a contestant on the Russian version of The Voice in 2013, but was not particularly successful. Based on their\nmusic video, Armenia could have been one of the most visually interesting performances, but sadly they didn\u2019t reach their\nfull potential in the live show. Honestly, the most notable parts are a memorable hairstyle, and a sound effect that sounds\nsuspiciously like a technical glitch, but yet is intentional. Without Russia being present to exchange douze points with,\nArmenia\u2019s score in the final may be dented.\nArmenia: Artsvik - Fly With Me\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nIsrael: IMRI - I Feel Alive\nThe artists and songs that represent Israel are always unpredictable, calling on a variety of genres and styles over the years.\nI Feel Alive is a fairly generic Europop song that will doubtlessly be heard in clubs across Europe in the coming months, but\nit doesn\u2019t really bring anything special to the Eurovision table. This song could so as well as several other similar entries,\nand the dancers dressed in black and white are not enough to visually separate it from the pack. While I\u2019ll be happy to\ndance to this in trashy Euroclubs this summer, it\u2019s not going to win.\nAfter being on hiatus from from Eurovision for fourteen years before 2011, Italy have come back strong, doing fairly well\nthe last few years. This year\u2019s entry, which went straight into the final as one of the Big Five, has the veritable honour\nof being simultaneously the most unsettling performance (is it cultural appropriation if it\u2019s about cultural appropriation\nthough?) and the favourite to win. It\u2019s a great song, bringing quirk and being camp in spades, but they\u2019re running the risk\nthat the message will be lost on those who don\u2019t speak Italian, meaning that their main selling point is a cheeky Italian man\nwho dances on stage with a gorilla for reasons unclear. If people get it, this could deservedly win, but they\u2019re definitely not\nplaying it safe.\nItaly: Francesco Gabbani - Occidentali\u2019s Karma\nMoldova: Sunstroke Project - Hey Mamma\nSunstroke Project have performed at Eurovision before, coming 22nd\nin the 2010 final with their song with Olia Tira. Now,\nthey are bringing back the widely acclaimed epic sax man in a slightly more mature performance, although there\u2019s still\nsomething of a Guy Fieri look about them. They make the most of only being allowed six performers on stage by cloning\nthemselves over and over on the back splash. They get points for the use of impressive mid performance costume changes\nand use of the running man, but although the song sounds great prerecorded, they didn\u2019t pull it off so well live in the\nsemi-final. Treading the line between a novelty act and generic Europop, Moldova are going to have to up their game if\nthey want to do well in the final.\nThe Netherlands are a Eurovision old hat, having only ever only missed four contests since 1956, and having won four\ntimes. The group of three sisters have previously represented the Netherlands in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest back\nin 2007. Their performance is clear and glamorous, their obvious experience working to their advantage. Lights and\nShadows treads the line between cheesy and uplifting, with strong use of Europop and near-a capella singing that highlights their vocal skills. In the semi-final, they fluffed a couple of notes, but with a flawless final performance, O\u2019G3NE could\nscore very well.\nNetherlands: O\u2019G3NE - Lights And Shadows\nPoland: Kasia Mo\u015b - Flashlight\nKasia Mo\u015b is one of many performers to have been in a reality music show (not affiliated with Eurovision) before being\nselected. She came third in the British, Must Be The Music, and well as The Pussycat Dolls Burlesque Revue. This might give\nher international recognition that may prove helpful when it comes to the scores. One of the only performers to have\nco-written their song, Mo\u015b\u2019s performance takes the Eurovision tropes of a man sawing away at a violin, swelling orchestral\nbacking, and even a dole of doves, and delivers it in a way that showcases her genuine talent. It\u2019s not a particularly original entry, but it ticks all the boxes to score well.\nPortugal\u2019s entry of a slightly unsettling jazzy love song performed in Portuguese by a somewhat strange man is reminiscent of French entries of old. This is one for the purists. Its melancholy and undeniable sadness comes across even without\nunderstanding the words \u2013 the Eurovision holy grail. The performance is simple, with no backing performers or distracting\nbackground. Expect Salvador Sobral to be charismatically uncharismatic as he clutches his arms to his chest and makes\nyou believe that he is truly searching for his long lost love. This song has done extremely well in previews, and looks likely\nto be Portugal\u2019s most successful entry yet, having never come higher than sixth place in a final.\nPortugal: Salvador Sobral - Amar Pelos Dois\nHungary are one of few performers to sing entirely in their national language. Those who stick to their language are\nusually afforded a place in the final by virtue of making the purists happy. Very few countries this year went down the\nobscure instrument and national dress route, but Hungry has done us proud. They might be trying to score points with tra-ditionalists, but Origo is catchy and somehow manages to feel contemporary while clearly being an homage Hungarian\nhistory. This might manage to avoid pleasing either the young or the old Eurovision crowd, or it could do both. Either way,\nI\u2019m a fan.\nHungary: Joci P\u00e1pai - Origo\n\n"

He gave a wonderful performance in the semi-final in the almost as good\nsequins and mesh, but sadly did not make it to the\nfinal. Maybe his song was good, or maybe he just\nreminds me of our esteemed editor-in-chief, but this\nwas my favourite music video of 2017.\nBest use of cultural appropriation\nCheck out the music video for Italy\u2019s Occidentali\u2019s Karma without any understanding of Italian or subtitles, I dare you. If it does make you feel a little\nbit uncomfortable, you maybe need to do a bit of reading up on cultural\nappropriation.\nEurovision is not a strange to cultural appropriation, but in recent years the acts\nhave become more politically correct to reflect the growing social awareness of\nthe audience. Despite this, Francesco Gabbani appears in a variety costumes\nfrom kimono-style jackets to saffron robes, posing like a Hindu god and dancing\nwith a man in a gorilla costume. The song is actually a mocking take on the way\nthat Westerners take Eastern ideas and Westernise them, piggybacking on ideas\nof spirituality and treating them as novelties that make them interesting and sexy.\nThe lyrics are somewhat sophisticated and reference science, art, and literature\nto make his point, but I feel that the point is somewhat lost. Even if you know that\nthe Western habit of appropriating cultures as our own is problematic, using these\ncultures in a form of mockery is still parodying them, and it is still disrespectful. It\u2019s\nhypocritical for Gabbani to imitate things that are meaningful to serve his point.\nThe live performance is a lot safer, with minimal obvious cultural appropriation\nbeyond the use of language. Given that the majority of the audience will not\nspeak Italian, the meaning of his lyrics is very likely to be lost, and a lot of people\nwill enjoy it for its faux-spirituality. By using this medium to make his point about\nthe Westerner\u2019s karma, Gabbani is serving only to do the same.\nBest use\nof props\nNaviband (Belarus)\nPerforming astride a rotating boat, with dry ice and wind\nmachines galore, Naviband sing, dance, and have the right level\nof interpersonal tension. I have no idea what they\u2019re singing\nabout, but the combination of the costumes, the props, and the\nmusical performance are working its Eurovision magic on me.\nNaviband (Belarus)\nFrancesco Gabbani (Italy)\nConchita Wurst winning Eurovision in 2014 showed us that the kitsch\ncraziness that happens at Eurovision extends beyond just the show. With a\nperformance as powerful as her voice, Wurst raised the stakes of standard\nfor powerful female soloists that followed. To have a bearded drag queen\nperform the beautiful Rise Like A Phoenix flawlessly and win as she so\ndeserved demonstrated that the Eurovision community was supportive of\ndiversity beyond the camp costumes and dances that Eurovision usually\nbrings.\nConchita Wurst - Rise Like A Phoenix\n(Austria, 2014)\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a guide to Eurovision without a moment dwelling on the\nultimate classic hit. The Swedes are the uncontested kings and queens of\nEurovision; it the winner isn\u2019t performed by a Swede, it was probably written\nby one. The 2016 Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm showed us that the\nSwedes are not to be beaten, bringing out Alexander Rybak and Lordi to\nperform musical skits mocking the contest itself, and even roping in Justin\nTimberlake to perform during the interval. Sweden\u2019s 1974 winning Waterloo\nwent on to be one of the best-selling singles of all time, and is the quintessential Eurovision track, defining the genre of Eurovision Europop.\nABBA - Waterloo\n(Sweden, 1974)\nAlexander Rybak won Eurovision with Fairytale by an absolute landslide\nin 2009, scoring 387 points and becoming the highest scoring song of\nall time. Having written the song and recorded the backing fiddle track\nhimself, the violin on stage was disappointingly just for show. Rybak\u2019s son\nis about a beautiful creature from Scandinavian fokelore who lures young\nmen to her, and curses them for all time. It came at a time when the world\nwas head over heels with the romanticism of Taylor Swift\u2019s Love Story and\nRybak\u2019s earnest innocence drove his popularity. Following the contest, the\nsong topped the charts all over the world.\nAlexander Rybak - Fairytale\n(Norway, 2009)\nIn 2006, Europe was ready for something different. Enter Lordi, a heavy metal\nband dressed as terrifying monsters (with the lead singer, Mr Lordi, wearing a\nfestive Finnish flag hat) who performed surrounded by huge amounts of pyro-technics. It was critically acclaimed as good for the Eurovision song contest,\npaving the way for entries that broke away from the generic cheesy Europop.\nAlthough it may not have been to everyone\u2019s tastes, they lead the votes all the\nway through the contest, scoring what was at the time, the highest ever score\n(beaten only by Alexander Rybak in 2009).\nLordi - Hard Rock Hallelujah\n(Finland, 2006)\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nSPECIAL\nHall of fame\n\n"

A key\ndetail of the second verse is\nthat a single line of the lead\nvocalist\u2019s lyrics is answered by\nfurious gang-vocals adding\na dangerous live feel to the\naccomplished song.

L\u00e9o Diaz lifts the lid\nonhisoeuvre,andfindsoutwhat\nmakes his films tick\nX\navier Dolan is\nnot your average\ndirector. What\nfirst sets him\napart is that he is\nextremely young:\n28 at the time of writing, he\u2019s\nalready released six full-length features. He directed\nhis first, I Killed My Mother,\nwhen he was just 20, and his\n2014 Mommy received the\nJury Prize at Cannes, along\nwith legendary director JeanLuc Godard\u2019s Goodbye to\nLanguage. However, while\nhis youth and remarkable\nmaturity must play a role, I\nbelieve they cannot account\nfor the profoundly polarising\nreactions his films elicit: when\nwatching a Dolan movie,\npeople either cry, or resent\nthat Dolan tells them to cry.\nThis is just me exaggerating since at least two of his\nmovies \u2013 I Killed My Mother\nand Tom at the Farm \u2013 do\nnot truly feature overly\ntear-jerking sequences like\nMommy does, for instance,\nbut the idea remains. Dolan\nobviously wants people to\nfeel something when they\nwatch his movies, but the very\nmeaning of tear-jerking hints\nat why some people instinctively hate this: sentimentality.\nI\u2019ve noticed that critiques\nthrown at his movies often use\nthe same words \u2013 artificial,\ngratuitous, easy; all in negative terms \u2013 and I believe this\nis because of sentimentality.\nI will come back to that later,\nbut given a seventh feature\nscheduled for release later\nthis year, (The Life and Death\nof John F. Donovan) I wanted\nto understand what his films\n\u2013 despite at the surface being\nabout very different topics\n\u2013 have in common; what justifies the repeated use of the\nsame adjectives in critiques.\nEssentially, I wish to ask the\nquestion: what makes a Dolan\nis another feature his movies\nhave in common: they are\nmeant to touch people, to\nchange them, make them\nfeel emotions. No surprise\nfrom a director whose\nfavourite movie is Titanic. He\neven says it explicitly: \u201cAu\nmake people remember him,\nin a constant race against the\nclock. This urgency means\nemotions are not expressed\nin the subtlest of ways, and\nI think that is where the\naccusations of sentimentality\noriginate. But where does this\nsentimentality come from?\nThe first part of the answer\nis that he conveys emotions\nthrough stories. As such,\nthe stories he tells must be\ngeneral \u2013 or to use another,\nblurrier, word: popular \u2013\nenough for everyone to\nidentify with, or at least be\nimmersed; that is why his\nmovies are dramas, even\nspilling over into melodrama.\nMommy is the perfect exam-ple, depicting the tumultuous\nrelation between Steve and\nhis mother, one that we know\ndoomed since the very first\nshots of the movie: indeed,\nwhat is more popular than\n(family) relations?\nThis leads to the second\npart: emotions are achieved\nthrough characters. In a\nsimilar manner to the stories\nbefore, Dolan\u2019s characters\nare people you might see on\n\\\\ When watching\na Xavier Dolan film,\npeople either cry, or\nresent that Dolan is\ntelling them to cry \\\\\nXavier Dolan | In praise of popular art\nmovie?\nThe most obvious theme\nthat runs through all six\nfeatures, at least partly, is\nthe way a son is seen by a\nmother, whether the mother\nis his own \u2013 most notably\nin I Killed my Mother and\nMommy, depicted through\neveryday relationships \u2013 or\nof a friend\u2019s (all the others).\nFunnily enough, the recurrent\nfigure of the mother is played\nby the same actresses: Anne\nDorval in three movies,\nand Nathalie Baye in two\nothers. What other themes?\nHomosexuality, obviously:\nit\u2019s explicitly present his first\ntwo movies, I Killed My\nMother and Heartbeats, and\nin Tom at the Farm where he\nhimself plays one of the main\ncharacters; but it\u2019s also a thin\nbackdrop in It\u2019s Only the End\nof the World, although it is\nnot explicit in the Jean-Luc\nLagarce text from which the\nmovie is adapted. However,\nI do not believe these themes\nexplain why his movies are\npolarising.\nInstead, what I think is\nresponsible for such reactions\n\\\\ Dolan wants us\nto identify to his\ncharacters so much\nthat they become\narchetypes, emptied\nof personality so\nthat we can fill in the\nvoid with our own\nemotions \\\\\ncin\u00e9ma, j\u2019ai besoin d\u2019\u00eatre\n\u00e9mu\u201d (\u201cIn cinema, I need\nto be moved\u201d). But, more\nimportantly, I believe this\ngoes back to his young age\nand early acclaim: within his\npersonality and his movies\nthere is an urgency to touch,\nto say what he has to say and\nXavier Dolan\u2019s Mommy, a festival hit, finds the director flexing his directorial muscles, expanding his technique \\\\ Allstar\n\n"

Unlike the Israeli\nambassador\u2019s talk which\nwas shrouded in secrecy,\nHassassian\u2019s visit was\nadvertised well in advance.\nThe format of the event was\nessentially the same to Regev\u2019s\nvisit, with Hassassian giving a\nhalf hour opening talk before\ninitiating a discussion and\ntaking questions from the floor.\nIn his opening monologue,\nHassassian spoke about the\ncurrentstateoftheconflict,how\nhe felt that there was currently\n\u201cno light at the end of the\ntunnel\u201d, and how negotiations\nwere essentially non existent.\nHis talk covered everything\nfrom the involvement of the\nUnited Nations in the peace\nprocess and the resolutions\nthat they have passed, to\ncriticisms of the United States\u2019\nhandling of their role as the\n\u201cbroker of peace\u201d.\nHassassian also touched\non President Trump\u2019s meeting\nearlier last week with\nPalestinian Authority President\nMahmoud Abbas, referring to\nit as merely \u201clip service\u201d, and\nquestioned if Trump even knew\n\u201cthe difference between a two-state and one-state solution\u201d.\nHe further accused Trump\u2019s\ndelegation of being biased\nagainst Palestine and called\nthem partisan (referring to the\nUS Special Representative for\nInternational Negotiations,\nJason Greenblatt, and Trump\u2019s\nson-in-law, Jared Kushner).\nThe ambassador\nalso chastised Trump\u2019s\ninflammatory comments\nin which he reduced the\ncomplexity of the situation.\nLast week the US President\nreferred to the Israel/Palestine\nconflict as \u201csomething that\nI think is, frankly, maybe not\nas difficult as people have\nthought over the years\u201d.\nHassassian pointed out that\nthe situation wasn\u2019t quite like\n\u201cbuying real estate in Las\nVegas\u201d.\nTrump didn\u2019t take home the\naward of Hassassian\u2019s \u201cMost\nFailed President in US History\u201d\nthough, that honour was\nawarded to Barack Obama,\nwho the ambassador felt had\naccomplished next to nothing\nin the conflict.\nDespite criticisms,\nHassassian seemed to be\na firm believer that peace\nnegotiations via international\nbodies (UN, US Government\netc.) were the only way\nforward and that \u201cPalestinians\ncannot liberate Palestine by\nfirearms\u201d. This faith in external\nmediation was contrasted\nby his frustration towards\ninternational bodies which he\nfeels have done very little to\nend the conflict. \u201c[Palestine\nand Israel today are] stuck\nbetween the historically\ninevitable and the politically\nimpossible,\u201d Hassassian said,\nand later added his doubts\nabout the prospect of a two-state solution.\nFollowing Hassassian\u2019s\nopening speech, the questions\nsection produced heated and\nemotional discussion from\nthe audience and Hassassian\nalike, and the topics of\nthe Palestinian Authority\nMartyrs Fund, the UN, and\nthe effectiveness of the\nPLO (Palestinian Liberation\nOrganisation) were discussed\namongst other things.\nThe event was realised thanks\nto efforts by Farri Gaba, an\naeronautics undergraduate,\nwho was pleased to see\nstudents from a range of\nbackgrounds participating\nin the conversation. \u201cI took\ninspiration from the previous\nIsraeli ambassador\u2019s talk\nabout the Palestinian-Israeli\nconflict to invite his direct\ncounterparttodiscussthesame\nconflict from the opposing\nview\u201d says Gaba. \u201cI did this\nto offer interested students a\nbreadth of perspective and\nunderstanding.\u201d\nDr Wraith, the chair of both\nevents, was similarly pleased\nwith outcome of the talk:\n\u201cThis time there was a very\ngood turnout of critical voices\nfrom the audience which I\nwelcomed. I contacted the\nIsraeli Society and the Jewish\nsociety beforehand, just as\nI contacted the Palestinian\nsociety last time, saying \u2018come\nalong, get involved, confront\nhim with what you think\nand what you know\u2019. They\nresponded and got involved.\u201d\nWraith is confident that\nthese talks are a testament\nto a change in the culture of\npolitical apathy Imperial has\nbeen known for: \u201dI don\u2019t think\nscientists have the option of\nbeing apolitical now, if they\never did. And judging by the\nrateatwhichthiseventsoldout,\nI don\u2019t think anyone wants to\nbe\u201d. This event takes place just\nweeks after 10,000 scientists\nand allies participated in the\nLondon \u2018March for Science\u2019.\nTrump\u2019s recent attack on\nclimate change and science\nin general, as well as the\npotential fallout that Brexit\nmight cause to research\nfunding, have highlighted the\nrelevance of politics to the\nscientific community. \u201cAlready\nI\u2019ve got yet more emails from\nstudents, just like Farri last\ntime\u201d added Wraith, \u201dsaying\n\u2018why don\u2019t we do another\nevent on India-Pakistan in\nKashmir? Why don\u2019t we get\nother ambassadors along?\u2019\nThere are plans underway.\nWatch this space.\u201d\nGaba himself has plans to\nmake this a regular occurrence\non campus: \u201cI hope to keep this\nmomentum in student interest\nand appetite going into next\nyear, with similar high profile\nguests. I hope to extend the\nscope of the topics discussed\nto different areas of global\npolitics and economics...\nEurope, America and the\nAsia-Pacific. I will hopefully\nbe doing this from within a\nclub soon to be established as\n\u2018The Speakers Club\u2019\u201d. Watch\nthis space indeed.\n\\\\ Unlike the Israeli\nAmbassador\u2019s\ntalk which was\nshrouded in secrecy,\nHassassian\u2019s visit\nwas advertised well\nin advance \\\\\n\\\\ Trump didn\u2019t take\nhome the award of\nHassassian\u2019s \u201cMost\nFailed President in\nUS History\u201d though,\nthat honour was\nawarded to Barack\nObama \\\\\n\\\\ Wraith is\nconfident that these\ntalks are a testament\nto a change in the\nculture of political\napathy Imperial has\nbeen known for \\\\\nNO PHOTOGRAPHY\nALLOWED FOR SOME\nDUMB REASON\nImperial Divestment Campaign resurrected\nOr is this the final nail in its coffin?\nLef Apostolakis\npeople for, say clean energy\nrather than oil and gas,\u201d says\nCook.\nIn fact divesting from fossil\nfuels while continuing to\nfunnel so much talent into the\nindustry would be hollow at\nbest if not outright hypocrisy.\nBut soon it might be the only\noption if we want to remain\ncutting edge and market\nour employability. In Europe\ncoal is rapidly being phased\nout, with companies such as\nDrax Group Plc, Steag GmbH\nto Uniper SE closing and\nconverting generators all over\nthe continent. In the US too,\nsolar alone currently employs\nmore people than coal, oil\nand gas combined, despite\nTrump\u2019s apparent love for the\nblack stuff.\nHow long will it make sense\nfor Imperial to keep pushing its\nstudents into a field that might\nnot exist for much longer?\n\u201cWe recognise that fossil\nfuels contribute to greenhouse\ngas emissions and we work\nto mitigate their impact while\nseeking viable alternative\nsources of energy,\u201d said an\nImperial spokesperson in\nresponse to the campaign.\n\u201cWe steward our endowment\ngifts carefully and believe\nthat we can have the greatest\nimpact on climate change by\noptimising these resources\nto invest in research and\neducation.\u201d\nProbably indefinitely.\nT\nhe divestment\ncampaigners at\nImperial are on\nthe move again.\nThis week saw\nthem taking to\ncampus with various events\nand actions. On Wednesday\nstudents dropped a banner\noff the main union building in\nBeit Quad. The banner which\nwrote out in large black and\norange letters \u201cIMPERIAL\nDIVEST NOW!\u201d was taken\ndown within hours. The Union\nhas come out in support of\nstudent-led campaigns but\nit remains unclear whether\nUnion Staff were involved in\nthe taking down of the banner\nOn Thursday, a chalk mural\nsprang up on the paved floor\nin front of Queen\u2019s Tower.\nAgain, security acted fast\nand put a halt to the protest,\nbut not before the realisation\nof a large four by two metre\nwide drawing. In response,\nsecurity personnel tried taking\ndown participants\u2019 College ID\nnumbers. When asked what\nthe problem was one member\nof security said it had nothing\nto do with the content but\nrather the fact that someone\nwould have to be called in to\nwash the mural away.\nIronically, in 2014 Imperial\nasked students to create a\nmassive chalk mural along\nImperial College Road for\nImperial Festival. Content or\nremoval didn\u2019t seem to be a\nmajor concern at the time. In\nfact, the mural fell victim to\nthe unpredictably wet summer\nweather and was washed\naway halfway through the\nfestival.\nCampaigners think Imperial\u2019s\ninvestments don\u2019t reflect its\naims as an institution, namely\nthe use of science to solve\nglobal challenges. \u201cThe fossil\nfuel industry\u2019s continued\nexploration is incompatible\nwith our future and undermines\nthe research done here on\nlow carbon technologies and\nclimate change,\u201d says Naomi\nPratt, one of the campaigners.\nThough both actions were\nquickly suppressed and it\u2019s\nunclear how many students\nnoticed them, those who\ndid felt divestment was an\nimportant issue to discuss. \u201cI\u2019m\nfairly on board with it\u201d, said\nLaurence Copson, a Climate\nChange, Management\nand Finance student who\nhappened to be at the Union\nwith his cohort during the\nbanner drop. \u201cI\u2019d just do it from\na financial perspective. I\u2019d just\nmake an economic argument\nfor why you\u2019d choose energy\nefficiency and alternative\nenergy over oil and gas\u201d.\nFor the first time in 2015,\ngreen energy accounted\nfor more than half of new\nelectricity capacity with the\nIEA predicting a 42% growth\nof renewable energy capacity\nby 2021. Then, last year,\ngreen energy development\novertook the fossil fuel sector.\nIn the US alone 22GW worth\nof green energy capacity\nor an equivalent of eleven\nlarge hydroelectric dams\nwere added to the energy\ninfrastructure.\nSo does that mean Imperial\u2019s\nmoney-making instincts might\nlead it to divest from Big Oil?\nJames Kennedy, another\nClimate Change student,\ndoesn\u2019t seem convinced.\n\u201cWhen you think about\nImperial and how much money\nthe chemical engineering\ndepartment for example must\ntake from big oil companies\nand how that provides huge\nfunds for research at our\nuniversity, this is probably\ngoing to be difficult.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the last nut\nto crack in term of universities.\nIt\u2019s got to be the most oil-and-gas-focused university in the\ncountry\u201d says Charlie Cook,\nanother member of the cohort.\nWould divesting even matter\nthough? According to a 2016\nFreedom of Information\nrequest Imperial has \u00a3220\nmillion in its endowment fund.\nThisincludessharesinoilgiants\nsuch as Exxon (\u00a30.52 million),\nCairn Energy (\u00a30.1 million),\nShell (\u00a30.86 million) and\nStatoil (\u00a31.05 million) as well\nas companies which provide\ntechnological services to Big\nOil such as Emerson (\u00a30.63\nmillion), Mitsubishi (\u00a30.88\nmillion), Petrofac (\u00a30.75\nmillion) and Schlumberger\n(\u00a30.92 million). These funds\nare insignificant in comparison\nto the human capital Imperial\nannually invests in the oil and\ngas industry.\nEvery year Imperial sends\nover 800 students into oil\nand gas or mining. But what\nif it didn\u2019t? \u201cThat would be a\nfar greater statement \u2013 if they\nwere going to say OK we\u2019re\ngoing to change the focus of\nthe majority of our courses so\nthat now we\u2019re trying to train\n\n"

After a night in the\nbus we set foot in Arzon, a\nfine coastal city at the heart\nof French sailing, the bay of\nQuiberon. We chose to compete in the Grand Surprise\nClass, a one-design class\nwhere every team races on\nidentical boats. The first day\nwas dedicated to training and\ngetting acquainted with the\nboat as most of us had never\nstepped foot on a Grand Surprise. Though we had trained\nin the Solent before the race,\nwe quickly realised how steep\nthe learning curve was and\nhow fierce the competition\nwould be, as most boats were\ncrewed by well-trained teams\nor even had professional\nskippers.\nThe competition started in\nvery light wind and bright\nsunshine, where the battle\nfor speed and boat trimming\nwere key. Unfortunately, we\nlost too much on the upwind\nlegs to allow us to compete\nfor the first spots. With some\ngood manoeuvres and\nsuperior downwind speed,\nwe gained some ground back\non the fleet to finish 16th\n, 19th\n,\nand 20th\n. Not the ideal start\nas we came back exhausted\nand sunburnt, but hoping that\nas we improved as a team\nand on the boat, we might\nclimb up the rankings over the\nrest of the week.\nThe wind picked up on the\nsecond day for the coastal\nraces, for which we had to\ntour the Bay of Quiberon.\nWith wind speed increasing\nand strong tidal currents,\nstrategy and tactics had\nadded complexity. The first\nrace was marked with fun\ncompetition from the Spanish\nof FNB which we overtook\nunder spinnaker after 45\nminutes of match-racing. On\nthe second race, we had a\nvery good start and turned in\nthe top ten at the first mark.\nUnfortunately, a boat refused\nour right of way after the\nmark forcing us into a crash\ngybe and left us on a collision\ncourse with a fishing boat\nploughing through the fleet.\nAfter another gybe to give\nthe trawler a comfortable\nsafety margin, we had lost\ntoo much to put in a high\nplacing. Sometimes, racing\nis not just about you and you\nlearn hard lessons about\nsportsmanship \u2013 or the lack\nthereof.\nThe wind dropped drastically on the 3rd\nand 4th\ndays\naccompanied by challenging\nwind shifts and sudden gusts.\nWe witnessed incredible\nsituations where the whole\nfleet, moving at less than\n0.5kt, would converge at\na mark, with boats gently\ncrashing onto each other and\ncrews resorting to eating,\ndrinking and playing music\nwhilst still competing. It was\nthe opportunity to befriend\nand chat with other sailors,\nwhile some went for a swim\nor climbed up the mast. They\neventually cancelled racing\non the 5th\nday due to a lack\nof wind. Unfortunately, we\ndid not qualify for the finals\non the last day which were\nwon for the second time in a\nrow by KPMG. Overall, ICYC\nfinished 14th\nin the student\ngeneral ranking, the first and\nonly British crew against the\nFrench Armada.\nHowever, CCE is not just\nabout sailing for the week.\nOnly a third of students\nattending compete through\nsailing, the rest battling in\ntrail-running, canoeing or\nbeach sports competitions.\nThe event is organized\naround a whole village\ncreated just for the occasion\nwhich we had time to tour,\nenjoying the sponsors\u2019 goodies and the massive parties\nthrown under the big tent\neach evening. We have to\nthank the wonderful organization team for the overall event\nand the EDHEC international\nteam for the very welcoming\natmosphere and delicious\nfood parties presented by\neach country. Our bungalow was in the middle of the\ninternational village, leading\nus to meet sailors from Turkey,\nCroatia and many other\nEuropean nations. Some of\nthem even invited us to race\nin their home country and we\nall came back with twice as\nmany friends. We are looking\nforward to repeating this\nexperience next year for the\n50th\nCCE, to be held in Brest,\nFrance.\nImperial College Yacht Club\n(ICYC) is the only student-led\nyacht club in London, focusing on yacht racing and\ncruising. The club is actively\nseeking for sailors from all\nexperience levels.

They hit the road at\n8am, with Eurotrash blazing\nout of the notorious Union\nminibus speakers through the\nstreets of London with the\ndestination set for Nijmegen\nin the Netherlands (not\nHolland) for the world\u2019s\nlargest relay race: the\n45th\nBatavierenrace. The\nBatavierenrace is an around-the-clock, 25-stage relay\nwhich takes more than 8500\nrunners across 175 km of\nDutch countryside to the finish\nat the University of Twente\njust outside Enschede.\nThe journey itself was\nfairly eventful, with several\ntraffic jams, multiple dabs and\nplenty of team-bonding. Club\nsnake, Greg Jones, was set\nto run the first leg, and the\nunexpected delays left him\njust half an hour to warm up,\napply the face paint and get\nin the zone for the start at\n10:30pm. Back at race HQ,\nthe remainder of the team\nwere preparing for the main\nrace which would begin at\n1am. The late arrival meant\nthere was a scramble to find\nsomewhere still open to get\nfood. Thankfully, MacDonald\u2019s came to the rescue to\nprovide the widely recognised\npre-race nutrition choice of\nBig Macs and fries.\nThe first leg was a standalone event and there was a\nshort break before the main\nnight shift kicked off at 1am,\nwith last-minute stand-in Alex\nBaldwin masterfully handling\nthe challenge of surprise hills\nand a competitive field. Each\nrunner during the race was\naccompanied by a cyclist for\nsupport and encouragement.\nZhen Wang-Koh kicked off\nthe first bike leg with Alex.\nAt this point the team split\nup to conserve energy. The\nnight team sped off in the\nminibus to chase Alex and\nZhen into the night, while the\nremaining athletes attempted\nto sleep on the floor of the\nsports hall. Over the next\nfew hours the brave Imperial\nathletes raced against the\ncold and dark under the\nDutch night sky, awestruck\nby not only the stars but the\ntrail of bike lights accompanying the runners through the\ndark fields. Charlotte Barratt\nnotably completed two legs;\nat 2 and 4am! The route\nbriefly crossed into Germany\nbefore coming to an end\naround 5am, at which point\nthe exhausted night-shifters\npassed out in the bus, having\nsuccessfully completed the\nfirst third of the race.\nMeanwhile the remainder\nof the team had their alarms\nset for 4:40am to drive to\nthe start of the morning shift\nin the town of Ulft. After an\nearly-morning rave to Gay\nBar and a feast of peanut-but-ter and jam sandwiches the\nmorning team were ready\nto go for the 07:15 restart,\nwith a borderline-hypother-mic Zhen forgoing sleep to\njoin the morning crew to run\nfor a second time (she still\nmanaged to beat both of\nher predicted times!). After\nmultiple storming runs, some\ncarefully executed changeovers and leg-winning runs by\nboth Liam Smith and Fergus\nJohnson, the team reunited in\nBarchem at noon for the start\nof the afternoon shift before\nthe grand finale.\nThe miles and final few legs\nflew by for the afternoon\nteam, despite many running\nfor a second time. Rob\nSalawa managed a 10km\nPB on his 10.7km leg and\nCharlotte brought the team\ninto Enschede \u2013 running for\nthe third time, having stepped\nin to cover for injuries. The\nstage was then set for Jenny\nLea and trip organiser/club\nlegend Matt Douthwaite to\ncomplete the final two legs of\nthe race and bring the sweaty\nvest to the finish line and\nallow the party to begin.\nOverall, the team finished\n17th\nout of 320 teams,\nalthough this included three\ndubious 15-minute penalties\nfor removing the vest/baton\ntoo early. Without these pen-alties, the team finished in a\ntotal time of 12:17:01 - placing\nin an even more impressive\n4th\n!\nThe sleep-deprived team\nthen set about applying\nthe most outrageous neon\nclothing and paint, along\nwith squad headbands and\nfinger lights, allowing the\nteam to perfectly blend in\nwith the Dutch locals who did\nnot dress up at all. The team\nraved hard and for as long as\nthey could before returning\nto sleep in another very hard-floored Dutch sports hall.\nAnyone who thought that\neveryone would be too tired\nfor any banter on the journey\nback was seriously mistaken.\nBridges were applauded,\nbreath was held for passing\nthrough tunnels, Rubik\u2019s cubes\nwere solved, thumbs up were\nenthusiastically waved at\nlocals accompanied with cries\nof \u201cYAAAAAAS\u201d, and tunes\nwere once again booming\nthrough the speakers in the\nqueue for the Channel Tunnel.\nThe trip was a big success\nand Imperial Cross Country\nand Athletics looks forward to\nreturning to the Netherlands\nagain next year.\n\n"

Perhaps\nthose spineless cheese-eating surrender monkeys weren\u2019t\ndrinking enough Kool-Aid, or for\nsome reason they managed not to\nbe manipulated by racial rhetoric.\nThis is just one of the many reasons\nthat France is so much weaker\nthan the English-speaking world\n\u2013 why couldn\u2019t they just follow\nright-wing populism like the rest of\nus? Why couldn\u2019t they just listen to\ntheir biased media and bask in the\nmutual hatred of Muslims and ethnic\nminorities? It\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t\nwant to see the destruction of the\nEuropean Union and the Western\neconomy and want unity in their\ncountry instead. Which is weird\nconsidering their motto is \u00e9galit\u00e9,\nfraternit\u00e9, and racism\u00e9.\nI can only assume that the large\nbody of water between Great\nBritain and lesser france must have\nkept the \u2018take our country back\u2019\nvibes subdued which is very much\ntheir loss. To be quite honest I am\nstill waiting to take my country\nback. I honestly thought that a\nvote for Brexit would be a vote for\na strong and stable Britain, but\nit\u2019s almost as if everything that we\nvoted for takes time. You know\nwhat though? If I have to wait to\nhave everyone that wasn\u2019t born\nin this country deported, then by\nJove I\u2019ll wait \u2013 I already have a\nstringent check-list for when we\nstart purging the country. Basically\nwe ask each person where they\u2019re\nfrom if they have dubiously tinted\nskin, and then when they give the\nanswer that\u2019s on their birth certif-icate, we ask \u201cbut where are you\nreally from?\u201d and then put them on\nthe next ferry to Macron-land.\nIn other news I\u2019m currently\nlooking for a job and it seems that\nthere may be an opening with\nthe Trump administration. I am\nof course talking about the FBI\nposition which may possibly stay\nvacant for a couple of months\nto a couple of years depending\non how long he can avoid being\ninvestigated. It would probably be\neasier if he could just grab the genitals of an entire organisation but\nthat would be pretty gay. I think,\nif anything, I am overqualified for\nthe position: I take commands very\nwell and never question anything\nthat Breitbart publishes; I\u2019m as\nstraight as they come (despite\nhaving that secret with my uncle\nTed); and I\u2019m fluent in Russian.\nI\nf I am ever in doubt about\nwhat to write in this column,\nall I have to do is read either\nThe Canary or my friend\u2019s art\nhistory Facebook page, and\nthen I find an issue that is the\npettiest waste of time, and then\ndedicate 400 words to this issue,\nwith full knowledge that each issue\nof felix is sent to the British Library\nand this nonsense will be archived\nfor all of human history.\nI just recently realised, unfor-tunately, that I will be out of the\ncountry for the general election\nowing to the fact there are too\nmany Gambian children who need\nmy white saviour soul to help build\ntheir schools. Also I\u2019ve noticed how\nI\u2019ve not been receiving as many\nsuper likes on my Tinder account\nwith my current photo of me taking\nayahuasca in Colombia. This\nsuggests that I probably need a pic\nof me with some African children\nworshipping me above my caption\nof \u201cSpreading peace and love and\nthighs\u201d.\nSo it looks as though Jeremy will\nonce again provide all the answers\nto the numerous problems this\ncountry has by spending money on\n\u2013 literally everything that people\nwant \u2013 without any plan for where\nthis money will come from. Perhaps\nDavid Cameron dropped a couple\nof billions down the sofa when he\nwas in 10 Downing Street and just\nforgot about it. It\u2019s possible that\nthey can tax all the rich people\nin the country and all they\u2019ll have\nto do is get the approval of the\nhundreds of rich people in the\nHouse of Commons and the House\nof Lords. Frankly if Corbyn\u2019s ascent\nto power isn\u2019t the second coming\nof Christ or the rebirth of true\ncommunism I think myself and the\nvegan consortium of Britain will be\nextremely disappointed. We will\nfeel as though we have pumped all\nour hopes and dreams into a fan-tastical idealist. I mean if this fails,\nI\u2019ll just move to Vermont and wait\nuntil 2020 for Bernie to rise from\nthe ashes. I mean yeah he didn\u2019t\nwin, but there\u2019s no way an old\nwhite socialist could beat a woman\n\u2013 it\u2019s just the natural order of white\nliberal priorities. If he\u2019s against a\nHispanic candidate then I think\nBernie will probably just have to\nretire that dream forever and get\nready to die.\nI think after this election, I will\ndecide to move my focus away\nfrom politics, and instead put my\ntime and energy into trying to\ncarve out a career as a successful\npodcaster. Unfortunately all the\ngood child murder cases have\nbeen investigated to death, but I\u2019m\nplaying around with developing\na hummus review show. It will\nalmost definitely be sponsored by\nSquarespace. Please support my\nPatreon. I don\u2019t want to work.\nMy interest is politics\nwill go up in flames\nwith Corbyn but look\nout for my podcast\nJonathan Masters is looking for\nnew ventures and unemployment\nopportunities.\nFuck off France\nMonathan Jasters is disappointed\nthat the French are failing to pull\ntheir weight\nS\nV\n* Sponsored\nbyThe New\nFederal Bureau\nof Investigation\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nImperial\nCollege's white\nvision for White\nCity\nAlex Chaudhri and Kieran Ryan think\nit's time the exclusive drinking societies\nwere held to the same standard as\neveryone else\nA\nt the end of\nlast term I\nattended a\nUnion Council\nm e e t i n g .\nBefore the\nmeetingcouldcommencethere\nwas an extensive powerpoint\npresentation about the\ncollege\u2019s development in\nWhite City, Imperial West,\ngiven by Professor Neil\nAlford (Imperial White City\nSyndicate).\nAs someone who has lived in\nShepherd\u2019s Bush this last year,\nI am aware of the rampant\ngentrification affecting the\narea, and I am disgusted by\nImperial\u2019s involvement in this.\nThe rent increases in W12\nhave already been forcing\npeople from their homes and\nincreased rates are quickly\ntransforming Shepherd\u2019s\nBush\u2019s diverse high street into\nyet another lifeless row of\nchain stores.\nAfter showings us slides with\na vision of White City campus\u2019s\nstreets lined with chain food\nshops \u2013 Costa, Pret a Manger,\netc. \u2013 Professor Neil Alford\nmade a \u2018joke\u2019, saying that he\ndidn\u2019t know exactly which\nstores would open up, but\nknowing the area perhaps\nthere would be a Chicken\nCottage. Chuffed with himself,\nhe received rapturous giggles\nfrom many of the assembled\nat the council meeting for\na comment that was racist,\ndeeply classist, and exposed\nthe condescending entitlement\nthat festers at all levels of this\nuniversity.\nI was appalled that he could\nso casually say something\nso vile. He effortlessly\nglorified his privilege over\nthe W12 community and was\nreceived with affirmation and\ncongratulation by the Union\nCouncil and members of the\nstudent body. Personally, I\nexpect that Chicken Cottage\nwould neither be able to\nafford the rent or that there\nwould be a community for it to\nserve, let alone be allowed to\nserve.\nAlready,thegoliathWestfield\nshopping centre sprawls\nacross the east of W12, and\nis currently expanding. The\n\\\\ Imperial have seen an\nopportunity to make a\nlot of money and taken it\nwith zero consideration for\npeople\u2019s lives \\\\\nshopping centre\u2019s architecture\nis designed to alienate the\nindividual, its clinical structure\nintended to make rich people\nfeel comfortable and to keep\nconsumerism slick. Behind\nWestfield is the former BBC\nTelevision Centre and Imperial\nWest. The W12 night sky is\npolka dotted with the red\nlights of construction cranes.\nIt\u2019s a picture we see across\nLondon (and the country\u2019s\nhigh streets). A community,\nwith little political or financial\ninfluence, who work hard to\nmake part of the city unique\nand interesting is recognised\nfor these facts and that area of\nLondon is labelled as \u2018exciting\u2019.\nThis is, of course, a term used\nto fetishise and brand an area\ninto a commercial product.\nThen the developers come\nin. \u2018Exciting\u2019 is an asset to\nincrease financial value, an\nestate agent\u2019s wet-dream.\nAlready rent is soaring \u2013\nmine has gone up 20% on\nthe previous year. Homes\nare being demolished\nand replaced by the same\nuniformity designed to make\nrich people feel at home.\nThey are designed such that\nthe incoming elite can feel\nunthreatened by the reality\nof diverse people having to\ncoexist in a city. The ethnically\ndiverse largely working\nclass community is becoming\ndisplaced, marginalised and\ndestroyed, and replaced\nwith rich, white, photo-op\nfavourable professionals. All\nmoney made from this venture\nwill be extracted to line the\npockets of the economic elite.\nOne of the first stages of\nconstruction, already well\nunderway, is the 35-storey\nluxury residential tower that\nis designed to rise high above\nthe neighbourhood and assert\nImperial\u2019s dominance. The\npurpose of the tower is to make\nmoney and to show off. It will\nhave 192 flats of which only\n12% are \u201caffordable\u201d three-bedroom homes. The law for\nresidential developments is\nthat 36% of homes must fit\nthis category. Imperial is not\nhaving to play by the rules.\nFurther to this, these 12% of\nhomes will be solely rented\nto \u201ckey-workers\u201d \u2013 people\nwhom the college has chosen\nto live there. They will not be\navailable to the public.\nMoreover, Imperial\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201caffordable\u201d was\na target household income\n\\\\ Homes are being\ndemolished and\nreplaced by the\nsame uniformity\ndesigned to make\nrich people feel at\nhome \\\\\nof up to \u00a377,200. In 2012,\nwhen the planning application\nwas accepted by Boris\nJohnson\u2019s Mayor\u2019s Office,\n\u00a337,900 post-tax income\nwas the 88th\npercentile in the\nUK. Clearly the College\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201caffordable\u201d was\neither fraudulent or totally\nout of touch. In fact, the\nMayor\u2019s office deemed this\n\u201coverpriced\u201d but still gave the\ngo ahead.\nAlford then congratulated\nthe College for entering\ninto a group of developers\ngentrifying the area. He hoped\nthat they would be able to do\nsomething like the King\u2019s Cross\ndevelopment. The King\u2019s Cross\narea is a huge redevelopment\narea controlled and operated\nby the King\u2019s Cross Central\nPartnership Limited. The\narea is policed by a militia\nof private security. Potential\nresidents undergo selection\nbefore they can even view\nthe mostly multi-million\npound properties to rent. Like\nImperial, King\u2019s Cross failed to\nprovide the legally required\naffordable and social\nhousing. In fact, they went\nfurther, cancelling some of the\nconstruction to build a further\n100 luxury homes. In 2012,\nCorporate Watch dubbed the\ndevelopment\u201cacrudeexercise\nin social engineering\u201d. Their\ninvestigation found that\npeople with a history of mental\nhealth were being deliberately\nexcluded from social housing\nand quotas were set for the\nnumber of homeless people\nin the area. The discrimination\nand exclusivity underpinning\nthese projects oppresses\npeople struggling to survive\nin our city and creates socially\ndead spaces. Imperial sets its\naspirations high.\nLet\u2019s be clear, White City\nCampus is a thinly veiled\nmoney making scheme,\nthe veneer of \u2018science\u2019 and\n\u2018education\u2019 are all that is\nneeded to shuffle through\ntheir plans. The vast majority\nof the site will be rented out\nto private businesses, chain\nshops and luxury housing.\nRegarding the start of\nconstruction on the residential\ntower, Imperial Development\nDirector Graham Stark said\nthat \u201c[the development]\ndemonstrates our long-term\ncommitment to delivering\na vibrant mixed use\ncommunity.\u201d This is a further\ninsight into Imperial\u2019s selfish\nignorance of the currently\nexisting community and\ndesire of the developers to\ncleanse the area of all but\nthe high rent economic elite.\nImperial College looks after\nits own. They have seen an\nopportunity to make a lot of\nmoney and taken it with zero\nconsideration for people\u2019s\nlives. As strong as this may\nsound, I am ashamed to be\naffiliated with the college.\n\n"
