    "content": "FELIX THE RAKES PROGRESS\nA PROFILE OF JOHN HOBSON\nJohn Hobson was born many years\nago in what was then the tiny hamlet\nof Barnet, Herts. The son of the Hertfordshire 100 yd s. sprint champion, he\ninherited from his father t ne athletic\ntorso which was to stand him in good\n3tea d in later life. At the age of\nfifteen he was a promising long j um per, being the Herts, junior champion,\nand when seventeen was placed second\nin the Southern Counties Junior cham-pion ships. Although basically a jumper and 3printer( his best 100 yd s. was then 10*4) \u00bb his one mile was 4*45\nsec., he was a member of his school\ncross-country team and played far\nhis l st XV an the wing. Even at school\nhe had the promise of good organising\nability; he held the post of vice-captain, and later, captain of the\nathletics team, and finally ran several illicit sixth-form dances unknown\nto the Headmaster.\nJohn came to I.C. as a mechanical\nengineer in 1951 and during his first\ntwo years threw all hi3 Interests into\nthe Engineering society and the Railway Soc., of which he was the treasurer\nin 1952. Though playing rugby regularly for the old Boys XV he found time far\noccasional games in College, and represented Guilds in the long jump in\nthe College sport a, gaining a half\ncolour.\nAt this stare in his career his\nPart II examiners saw fit to elect\nhim a member of te most popular club\nin I.C. John repeated his second year,\nand became \"visits secretary\" for the\nRailway Soc. and gained his first I.C. athletics colours (he has had re-awards every year since then). During\nhis final year in 1955 John was treasurer\nof the I.C. Athletic Club, and, as ever,\nfaithful to the locomotive, was chairman\nand visit 3ec. of the Rly. Soc.\nJohn's pro life rous term-time\nactivities are almost equalled by his\nvacation pursuits. His love of Scottish scenery is attributable to his\nhaving cycled, over most of the Scottish Highlands. He has visited Norway\nss a member of the 1956 I.C. Athletic\nteam, and his two visits to Denmark\nhave given him a fine appreciation of\nDanish beer and food. Jo JI has had\na series of vacation jobs the worst of\nwhich he tells me \"was working for\nCivil engineering excavation manufacture - I spent a fortnight on b lad ing bulldozers.\"\nHe has a few views on what he\nlikes which include:\nSteam engines, classical music and\nopera, cheese making, buttered crumpet,\nwiener brod, strong tea, natural -s llar s, Charrington's Burton, lager and _ce, circuit training, and social and athletic intercourse.\nHe has definite views on what ho\ndislikes which include:\nDull stereotyped thinking, red\ntape, dogmatists, crawlers, habitual\nto per s, cliques, smooch y bands, the\nPiccadilly line and the B.S. S. index.\nlie has even more definite opinions\non un de graduate life, which he feels\npeople do not appreciate until their\nthird year, and which he says , is second only to Post-Graduate existence.\nHe is of the opinion that at least\none year at College should be spent in\nthe hostel, and would like to see more\npe o, le, including P.G. students, participating in one or two college act iv i ties. His views, I think, are worthy\nof the notice cf anyone, but particularly of the first-year student who finds\ndifficulty in orientating himself in\nthe tangle of social activity and academic work that is college life.. ju it e prepared to leave college\nwith his 2nd class non ours, John was\nunexpectedly invited to do a3 year\ncourse of research in coro sion fatigue,\nnon-metallic protective coatings, and\nthe durability of latex substitutes.\nHereafter, John indulged in a profusion\nof activities. His first two PostGraduate years ne was the P.G. re-present at ive, lect i red High\u00abi National\ncourses in evening classes and was vice-captain, then captain of the athletic\nClub.\nJohn h*s been the Guilas organiser\nof t ne last two Lord Mayor's Shows, and\nis the present president of the Athletic\nClub. Never having attended a carnival\na* an undergrad u a ie( shame] ; he decided\nto rectify this and has been a member\nof the last two years' Guilds entertainments Committees.\nBY\nGILBERT AND SULLIVAN MONDAY TO THURSDAY MARCH1720 CONCERT HALL AT 7 4 5 PM Ticket J price 5/-T3/6 and 2/6 on sale in the Union every km eh tw vw or on the night\nTHE DEBATING TERM Debating has proved to be a popular College activity this year,\nand the Lit. and Deb. Soc. has been\npleased to see the increase in the number of people attending. Audiences\nhave varied from some 250 at a joint\ndebate with Beford College, down to\n40 at a discussion of a religious\nmotion- It is interesting to n cte that the smaller houses have produced\nsome of the best floor debating:\nlarge houses seem to be attracted by\nmore frivolous motions, and these are\nmore difficult to s pea x on than those\n:n which one has a serious concern.\nThree debates have been held sc\nfar this term. On January 21st the\nmotion was \"Triat \u00ab-an has made God in\nhis own Image* with the College\nChaplain the Rev. Cleverly Ford, and\nDr. Harold Allan, as the principal\nspeakers. There was some hard-hitting\ndebating of a very high stan u ard, and\nthe motion was rejected with a large\nnumber of abstentions.\nOn Feb. 11th, the College was\nvisited by the American Debating Team,\nwhich toured the country, I.C. being\none of the two individual London\nColeges at which they spoke. About\n120 people heard the discussion of\n\"That women's suffrage was a mistake,\nand should be revoked.\" This produced some exceedingly witty speaking from the platform, both from\nPooofsky and Stokes, the Americans,\nand from Finch and Allen of I.C., who\nwere by no means outclassed. The\nfloor speeches, unfortunately for our\ntransatlantic reputation, were few,\nand of poor quality; even if all possible allowance be made for the\ndifficulty of a peaking on a weak\nmotion.\nThe third meeting tis term, on\nFeb. 25th, waa to have been a debate\non Trade Unionism, with the well-known right-wing politician Edward\nKartell opposing a speaker from the\nT.U.C. This had to be changed into\na Brain's Trust, in which three speakers\ntogether with two provided by the\nSocialist Society, sat and answered\nquestions put by the audience. Both\nquestions and answers were keen and\npointed, and several really good arguments were heard. There was an audi eno*\nof 150, and its enthusiasm to some extent belied the current political apathy\nat this College. It is a pleasant\noo tuB enter y on the climate of controversy\nat this moment, that the th res outside\nspeakers after fighting a fierce verbal battle on the platform were able\nto share the se me taxi hone.\nThe Society's progress in competitive debating ended early this term\nw nen we were beaten by Birkbeck in\nthe second ro and of the TJ.L. debating\ntournament. Oar defeat was not a crushing one, and the presence of the\nBirkbeok tea* in the final of the\nnationwide N. TJ.S. debating tournament\nattests to its eso all eo oe. It would a ea a that I.C. debating\nis in a reasonably healthy condition,\nbut it probably would be considerably\nbetter. Tne nucleus of experienced\nspeakers is growing, and paper speeches\nare almost always good, but if the\npeople aba attend debates would o oae to regard themselves less aa an audience\naad Bore aa active w ambo i a of the House,\ntba a the general standard ef debating\nwould increase in leaps ami bounds.\nP.

Most of the prints and transparencies making up the display reached a good technical standard, but the exhibition left a feeling of diss at is fao tion. It seemed far more a snap-shot\ndisplay than a photographic exhibition.\nIn the black and white classes particularly there were very few deliberate\npictures; even sons of the most pleasing probably owed more to luck th sn to\nreal planning.\nThis impression was supported by\nsome prodigious and un selective personal entries and by the fact that\nthere were so few 'experimental' photo-graphs.

Record shots on the other hand\ngive soo pe for snap-shooting at its\nbest, and judged in this context many\nof the entries were mo3t impressive.\nThe deliberate photo gr np ii y of the\nportraiture nec ion was dominated by\nT.P. Xovattana's charming studies. No\nother entry matched these for ease of\nposing and technical finish.\nThe black and white display was\nmarred by a number of prints wh i oh sadly lacked exhibition finish. There\nwere several stained prints and numerous dirty mounts (organizers to blame?)\nwhile the standard of mounting and\ninanity of some titling spoilt many an\nattractive picture.\nIn part,the exhibition was redeemed by the colour section. The transparencies abounded with well planned and\no are fully photographed pictures. Above\nall, the entries showed a fine sense of\noo] our.\nThe society should think carefully\nhow it can bring the standard of its black and white section up to that of\nthe colour transparencies.

The current criticism was certainly not.\nIt is conn on practice to attack\nstudents for their apathy to the life that goes on around them. They are\ncalled narrow, specialist and irresponsible. They are thought of as\nbeings without any interest in humanity as a result of the bullying abuse\nof position x a de by many members of\nstaff, who seem to forget they are\ntraining human beings, not robots or\ntalking vegetables. Probably more\nstudents stand up to this criticism\nthan the critics would like to imagine. They become well-educated,\nadaptable and competent. But there\ni* a large residue who do need better education.\nWhat are the aims of education?\nProfessor D. J.O 'Connor (Philosophy,\nLiverpool University) summarise s them\naa follows:\n(1) to provide men and women with\nthe minimum of skills necessary for\nthem to (a) take their place in society\nand (b) seek for further knowledge.\n(2) to provide them with a vocational training that will enable them to be\nself-supporting.\n(3) to awaken an interest and a taste .\"or knowledge.\n(A,) to make them crit io al(5) to put them in touch with and\ntrain them to appreciate the ou lt wal and moral achievements of\nFive clauses. Bow many dos s Imperial College fulfil? Obriously\nonly (1) and (2). As for the rest we\nare sadly lacking. Perhaps quit* a few people achieve (3) but vary rarely\nbecause they are inspired by the WJJT\nmembers of staff conduct their research\nor teaching. The crit-cal faculty is very mu oh suppressed by demanding\nridiculous \"cramming\". Heads are\nstuffed full of fact a instead of being\ntrained to think. Worst of all is the\nway Imperial College attempts to carry\nout (5)\u00bb All these five aims are closely interwoven and the higher the form\nof education the more important (5)\nbecomes. Train a scientist the present way; turn him loose into a job.\nIf it is soap pow des perhaps it is\namusing pl fit is munitions research\nthen we hope he is aware of what he\nis doing.\nSome students are awake to this\nproblem but they are powerless to eff eot any direct change. They can only give\nvoice to their ideas. We don't want\ncultural cotton wool; we want a better educational system. We rust have\na better, more h\"ui is tlc approach to\nscience or the vast new buildings will\ndo more harm in the world than good.\nScienoe and technology are culture,\nif taught properly. In the words of\nD.H. Lawrence: \"Even the real scientist works in a sense of wonder.

RUGBY, RIFLE CLUBS COLLECT TROPHIES ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE UNION An ordinary Union meeting waa held\nin the Concert Kail on Thursday march\n6th. Once again the ref eo tory situation waa rai ted, and the question of\nmascots was also discussed.\nMr. Barber held forth for some\ntime on the sub j eot of eating and food,\nboth of wh i oh, he said, were essential .\n'low ever, members seemingly come to\na ee tings to be enter tal ned and| when\nthey had tired of Mr. Barber, he was\nhowled down.\nit was suggested from th* floor\nthat Herbert be done away with and\nthat a miniature Colcutt tower be constructed to serve as a College rag\nmascot, but a motion to this effect\nwas rejected. After some discussion\non what should be done with Herbert,\na motion that he should be placed in the bar was carried. Tie. T.C. Smith\nasked whether a committee might be set\nup to inquire Into the sub j eot of rag-g ing. However, Mr. Butters pointed\nout that there were unwritten laws\nwhich were usually adhered to.\nEXIT MINES NIGHT The audience at the Mines Sight\nof the Dramatic Society's production\nof \"Misery He\" distinguished Itself\nby an appalling exhibition of bad\nmanners.\nThe organised interruptions which\nare th* essence of Mines Night were\namusing; but persistent coarseness\nand obscenity from irresponsible\nelement* oau**d much distress to M the ladles In th* east and la th*\naudience.\nIt is unlikely that there will b* any further Mine* Sight*.\nTony Hodgson proposed that at the\nend of each academic year the Union\n\u2022hould el eot a Provost. His function\nwould be to entertain the Union, al though it was not made clear exactly\nwhat was meant by this. The motion\nwas carried.\nThe Union Is discontinuing pro-cee ding* in the matter of the boat\ndamaged on Hornby Day because \"we\ndo not want to incur the displeasure\nof the Wandsworth Borough Council\"\nas it is hoped to obtain f roc them\npermission to extend the Boat House.\nThl* term the lift has broken\ndown eight times. Waygood-Otis are\non to a good thing, repairs often being carried out after normal working\nhours and charged accordingly. The\nprovision of a ntl overloading devices\nwill cost about \u00a3200. Should any\nmore tr cub le be caused, the whole\nthing may have to be rebuilt.\nBo, Clem and Jesebel will b* going to the W.U. S. Carnival at Bedford\nearly next May. I.C. will be erecting and men n lng a sport-palace.\nPolitical literature has again\nbeen circulated, this time rel at lna to Algeria. It was pointed out that\nen-the\u2014spot action by member* would\nprobably effect the desired desi eta nee. An Union card check for the fol lowing Monday was announced.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE ART CLUB\nANNUAL EXHIBITION WILL BEHELD IN THE LC UNION\nEARLY IN THE SUMMER TERM\nImperial College has once again\nshown that without any shadow of doubt\nit is the strongest sporting college\nin the University. In the past few\nweek* IC. teams have won the U.L. Bugby Cup, Blfle (\"Engineers\") Cup,\na half share in the Boxing (\"Blott\")\nCup, and come second in the Hyde Park\nRoad Relay. The result of the latter\nevent demonstrates that the Crosscountry Club, wh i oh in December won\nthe U.L. Cup, can beat any college\nor university in the country, with\nthe single exception of Liverpool.\nAlthough not so fortunate in\ntheir respective cup competitions,\nthe I.C. Hockey and Soccer clubs\nhave also enjoyed very successful\nseasons.\nI.C.3: KING SO A MOST EXCITING CUP FINAL ENDED WITH\nI.C. PROUD HOLDERS OF THE CUP FOR THE\nFIFTH TIME IN SEVEN YEARS - A REMARKABLE\nRECORD.\nA large crowd of supporters (whose\npresence was much appreciated by the\nteam) saw I.C. fight magnificently\nagainst a King's XV wh i oh won a large\na har* of the ball,but which could not\nequal I.C.'s fir* in the loose. Bo'\nand Jesebel were there - and so was\nthe I.C. Jasz Band (leader Balaclava\nLeston). Mr. Leston will be sorry to\nlearn that he missed most of the victory\ncelebrations, which, at the time of\nwriting (Sunday afternoon) are still in\nprogress and show few signs of abating.\nAlthough I.C. won the ball from\nhardly a single scrum and very few\nline-outs, their vigour in the loose\nand sound defence won the day. King'*\nhad the advantage of a moderate breese\nin the first half but failed to score.\nThe fine touch kicking of Seed and\nHeam was a great asset to I.C. Our\nforward* cee med to be a tung by their\ninferiority in the set scrum s and line-out* into unsurpassed a oh lev ment* in\nall aspect* of loo*e play. The back\nrow (Gilbert, Wright sad Parker) was\nhere, there and everywhere, and Evans\nand Gibbons, from the front row, were\nalso very prominent.\nIn th* seo on d half I.C. kept Xing'*\npegged inside their own \"twenty-fir*\"\nalmost continuously. King'* repeatedly\ngained possession only te find them*\n\u00bbel ve* tackled relentlessly and\nharassed so much that they le*t as much\nground as they gained.\nTea admit** from th* end cam* th*\nmoment of glory. Ted Wright picked the\nball up la the loose, ran round the\nblind side of the scrum, threw th* ball\nto Otto Gilbert and John Gibson, she,\nbeta a ea them, dribbled the ball over\nthe King** line, Gibson (coring th* try\nten yards in from touch. Oggi failed\nwith the kick.\nContinued an pas* 8\n\n"

Station. This cellar is also used aa one means of a oo e as to\ntha adjacent boiler room. Consequently\nshooting is sometimes interrupted by\nworkmen who, despite the safety pre-cautions, Insist on walking through\nbetween the firing point and tha tar-gets.\nAt times during last year shoot x ag was further interrupted by flood water\nfrom the nearby building site, wh i oh filled the whole range to a depth of\nseveral l aches.. It was suggested that\noe rta in people might do better if they\naimed at the reflection of the targets\nia tha water, but to la was di so our eg sd.

As the day drew near\nthe tension mounted, poises quickened,\nam til at last they swooped, causing\nabounded delight for the lucky and\nthe utmost misery for the rest.\nThe Dinner va a excellent, a fine\nexample of Mr. Ho Joey's haute cuisine.\nAfter-dinner speaking began vith Mr.\n0.

This time a Communist Government waa in office and tha\nConservatives vera the a a i a Opposition\nparty.\nThe peril meant was opened by tha\nQueen who read a speech beginning, \"As\nthis is the last time I shall be addressing you . . . \" sad continued by outlining the Government's proposed electoral reforms.

The\nJess Club activities this term have at\nlast bees widened to \u2022it y tii y^ por far a an oe a of lunch hour concerts, as veil as the\nusual record recitals.\nThe first Jass Concert was held\non Thursday Jan 30thin the Concert\nBall and ao ert a in amount of trepidation was experienced by the organ i tiers\nin wondering if they would get any support at all. However, all their fears\nwere groundless, as by about 2 p.a.,250 people were in the Concert Hall and\nall obviously enjoying the music. Tha\nI.C.

This time the musicians\nwere relaxed and soon got over the nervousness vh i oh marred parts of the first. concert and a full hour and a quarter of\ntraditional, modern and 'Jump' music was\nproduced.

I.C. immediately resumed\nthe onslaught, and a burst-through by\nGilbert, well supported by Crosier,\nended a yard short of the King's line.\nThis was a fine climax to a great\nseason, and it was very bad luck that\nthe I.C. Captain, Barry Lane, was prevented by injury from participating\nactively in the crowning triumph of a memorable year.\nLOST: One small metal man, in rugby-playing attitude, who screws into the\nlid of the U.L. Rugger Cup.\nWANTED: Some-one who can re-shape,\nfree of charge, a mass of metal into\nthe configuration formerly recognizable\nas the U.L. Rugger Cup.\nHOCKEY P. Bhatnagar, who played for U.L. on\nSaturday, brought the total of I. C.B.C. players who have played for the University this season to eight. The others\nare 7.mantle (U.L, Secretary), A. Powell\n(Fixture Secretary), R.C. J. Stanton,\nN.G. Holmes, D.M. Rees, M.J. Lofting, and\nR.B. Lee,\nWithout these men, however, the I.C.l st, team is enjoying its best season\nfor several years, having lost only 5\nof its28 matches. Two strong teams\nwill be sent to the U.L. sixes, and we\nare hopeful that one of these will bring\nback the Cup, which would make a fitting end to the season.\nSat. 8th. Mar oh: Ealing Dean 1, I.C.4. ATHLETICS One of this term'a two matches was\nheld on Wed.,5th March. The result was\nthat we lost to U.C. by 72 points to\n91. The full results are not yet avail-able.\nThe second meeting this term will be\nat Hurlingham Park on Sat.,March 15th., a three-sided competition with L.S.E. and Q.M. C. The Inter-collegiate 3,000m. Steeplechase Championship will take\nplace before this meeting, at 2.00 p.m., and supporters are invited to cheer\ntheir oo lle ge runners(7) through the\nwater and fences.\nCROSSCOUNTRY\nOn Wed. March 5th. the Club defeated\nLondon Hospital in an away match.\nLandbeok and Collins successfully dropped the leader of the opposition, and\nran in together for first place.\nThe first team defeated Cranwell on\n8th. March, but lost to l&l o carl an a. The race was run on a flat 5-mile course\nnear the Cranwell airfield, in abl izz ard. Collins was 2nd. and Conway 4th. in a field of 20. On the same date a rather weak second team lost to\nBancrofts School over a muddy 5j mils\ncourse in Epping Forest.\nROAD RELAY The tenth Hyde Park Road Relay on l st. March was the usual great success. It\nwaa quite obvious that, with 42 teams\nrunning, including some of the best\nathletes in the country, records were\nsuri to go. The pace was set from the\nstart by Shaw (B 'ham), who sped round\nthe 2f mile course in 13m.6s. So hat\nwas the pace in this first lap that the\nfirst 15 men were under 14 mins. John\nCollins ran a magnificent leg for I.C. handing over to J F. Jaeger In 4th. pla ee, with a time of 13:31. Jaeger\nheld his pla ee well, gaining on Liverpool who had moved into the lead. Only\n4 sees, separated the leading five\nteams at this point, and Jaeger handed\nover to Dave Briggs after doing an\nexcellent time of 14:00. Save quickly\nwent into the lead, only to be overtaken by Adams (Sheffield).\n\u20220it Jean Conway took over from Brings\n(who did 13:37), rapidly passed the\nSheffield man, and retained the lead\nfor the rest of the lap, sending John\nEvans on his way with a10 yd. lead.\n(Conway's time: 13:33). Evans, with\nthe second best time of the day (13:01)\nbuilt up a big lead. A feature of this\nlap was the ama sing run by Martyn Hymen\n(Southampton) who returned 12m,39s, to\nbreak the lap record by 16 sees. This\ntremendous performance means that Hymen\nshould be within 20 seconds of the\nWORLD RECORD for 3 miles.\nRoger Landbeck went away on the final\nlap with the cheers of about 200 I.C. supporters speeding him on, but before\nHyde Park Corner Wesenoraft (Liverpool)\nhad caught and passed him. Roger gave\nchase, and from Victoria Gate was\ngaining on the Liverpool man, but I.C. had once more to be content with 2nd. place, 5 sees, behind Liverpool(81:37),\nThis shattered the previous record of\n82:28 set up by Loughborough in 1956.\nSouthampton, 3rd. in 81:51, and Loughborough, 4th. in 82:26, also beat the\nprevious record.\nOf the other London Colleges, L.S.E. were 9th., U.C.11 th,, King's18 th., Guy's20 th., and Q.M. C.23 rd. The\nImperial College Union Cup for Colleges\nof less than 500 men was won by Selwyn\nCollege, Cambridge, who.were 15th. The Wooden Spoon was gloriously won by\nSir John Csss College.\nSPORTS DAY MAY14 th. Will all sportsmen please look at the\nIndividual Collage Athletie Club\nnotice-boards for details.\nRIFLE CLUB ENGINEERS CUP STATS AT I.C. For the 6th. time in J years I.C. has\nwon the ENGINEERS CUP. Although the\nresults of the final round are not yet\nknown, it iso ert a in that the 'A' team\nhas won the 1st. Division with a record\naverage, and probably the 'B' team will\nbe second, I.C. teams are also well\non the way to winning the 3rd. and\nNovices Divisions and one of the lower\nDivisions in the County of London\nLeague.\nIn the Courtman Shield eos petl tion between the three constituent Colleges\nGuilds gained a decisive victory by\ndropping only one point in each round;\nMines were second.\nsua.\n\u2014 sC(H T PO AT As the season is drawing towards\nits end, the l st XI have lost the goal-scaring power which was an encouraging\nfeature of the earlier games of the\nseason. Ironioally, the team have\nplayed good football recently. Sufficient goals were scored to beat\nL.S.E.21, and draw with Christ's Coll. Camb. 4 - 4 , but in recent\nmatches with King's College, I.C. outplayed the opposition for long periods\nbut could not turn the superiority in to goals and in the end it was King's who demonstrated how to convert a few\nchances into as many goals.\nThe 2nd,3 rd, and 4th XIs have\nbeen unbeaten in the last 28 matches,\nthe chief credit being due to the 3rd XI who have not been beaten since Nor.\n16th. The result of this excellent\nrecord is that the 4th XI have gained\npromotion, the 3rd XI are champions of\ndivision II of the intercollegiate\nleague, and compete next season in\ndivision I with the 2nd XI, who need\nto win the next two games to win the\nDiv. I championship.\nRecent visits have been made to\nOxford and Cambridge. The l st and\n2nd teams were entertained by Christ's( Camb.) and the following week the 3rd and 4th visited New Coll. and Brasenose\nOxford, whilst Brasenose l st were\ntrounced and entertained by the 2nd XI\nin London. Judging by reports of these\nexcursions, I.C. men considerably enlivened Oxford and Cambridge.\nOn Sunday, 23rd February, two\nteams played a soccer \"sport\" match\nv. the Rugby Club. Both games provided amusement for all concerned.\nHaving won the soccer battle the dub await the return match at rub gy with\nmuch trepidation and little knowledge of the rules.\nOn Saturday 8th March, I.C. staged\na six-a side competition for Kensington\nColleges, including R.C.A. and C.E.M. Fortunately the Stephens Shield\nremains at I.C. in the possession Of\nR.C.6. whose \"A* team won the final\nagainst C.< \u00a3 G.\"B\". The losers competition was again won by R.C.S.\" C\".

The venue this year was the\nSwindon Works of British Railways\nWestern P.eg lon; these, the largest\nlocomotive works in this country,\ncover an area of 326 acres and were\nerected originally for the Great\nWestern Pallway at the approximate\nhalf-way point of the London - Bristol run. Many of the original workshops are still in existence, and\nthese show the massive scale on wh i oh Brunei and his fellow engineers\nworked.\nSome of these shops have\nbeen modernised to a certain extent,\nbut in view of the forthcoming electrification of the railways there\nwill be a progressive run-down of the\nfacilities provided and a gradual conversion to the servicing of diesel-mechanical. diesel-electric and electric locomotives and the associated\nrolling stock. At present they are\nfabricating low-cost, light-weight\ndiesel stock on almost production\nline methods in that all components\nare fabricated away from the fitting\nbays.\nIn the locomotive shops many\nfamous steam locos were in various\nstages of repair, some being stripped down to merely the boiler shell\nand firebox. T.'o dern is ation is on\nthe way however, in that they are\nbuilding several Maybaoh dle sel me oha nio al locos with me ch hydro\ntransmission under licence from the\nGerman firm.
