    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday January 23rd1987 Letters\nConsoc\napology\nDear Dave,\nI would like to pass on Mr\nGoosen's apologies to all those who\nturned up to hear him speak on South\nAfrica's future. As you will know, the\nmeeting had to be cancelled because\nMr Goosen had gone down with food\npoisoning.\nI would also like to assure you that\nIC Consoc will be arranging another\nmeeting as soon as possible and\npreferably before the end of term. IC\nConsoc like Anti-Apartheid looks forward to the end of Apartheid in South\nAfrica and we believe that Mr\nGoosen's talk should be of great interest to anyone concerned about\nSouth Africa's future.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Jarvis\nExternal Affairs Officer,\nIC Conservative Society\nPATA\nresponse\nDear Dave,\nWhen Paul Kapusta was allowed to\nrevive PATA (Positive Alternatives\nto Abortion Society) it was after some\ndiscussion. This was to the effect that\nin keeping with the aims of this society he would have to discuss alternatives as well as presenting the antiabortion case. Sadly, I have to date\nseen little or no evidence of such a discussion. Perhaps he could\nenlighten us on this seemingly under-publicised area of his activities.\nYours,\nChas Jackson\nUlUtravel\nWherever you want to go...\n\u2022 Worldwide flights.\n\u2022 Special fares\nfor students\nand academics.\n\u2022 Tours and\nshort breaks.\n\u2022 Ski holidays.\n\u2022 European trains.\n...we'll get you there!\nEnquiries and Bookings SO European 01-581 8 2 3 3\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nUnbeatable prices \u2014 unbeatable quality!\nCall in and see how far you can go.\nULU Travel\nImperial College\nSherfield Building\nA service of\nsm\nTheWoridbeaters\nSouth Africa\nThis week's news section includes, in\nthe report of the cancelled Consoc\nspeaker meeting, details of an\ninterview with Mr Peter Goosen of\nthe South African Embassey. Mr\nGoosen cancelled his visit to College\nbecause of food poisoning. Much of\nwhat he said would have formed the\nbasis of his talk and, as he says, he is\nkeen to come to College to put\nforward his views. We have printed\nwhat he said as accurately as possible. The interview he gave FELIX was\ntaped by the Embassy, and Mr\nGoosen asked to be shown the copy\nbefore publication. We agreed to this;\nin the event the only changes he\nadvised were minor ones-not\naffecting the article in any way other\nthan to amend a couple of genuine\nin ac cur rac ies. What we have printed is, of course, a series of \"Press Office\" statements\nfrom the South African Government.\nPersonally I find nearly all of what\nMr Goosen has said condescending\nand rather offensive. At the same time\nI do not think it helpful to adopt a \"no\nplatform policy\" in our press\ncoverage of the South African\nsituation. I have sympathy with the\nview that groups whose ideologies are\nparticularly extreme should be\nprevented from broadcasting their\npoint of view, but this is not a constructive course of action. The\nSouth African regime is not going to\nbe harmed by a lack of publicity. NUS Feature\nThis week's main feature is a condensed version of reports written\nby Chris Martin and Bill Goodwin,\nwho attended the NUS conference\nlast month on behalf of the ICU\nExternal Affairs Committee. In the\nlast few years there has been some\ndebate within the Union over whether\nor not to send observers to these\nconferences. I recommend that you\ntake time to read what they have\nwritten. Few of us at this College\nknow a great deal about the workings\nof the NUS. Too many of those who\nfervently support one side or the other\nbase their opinions on third hand\ninformation. Chris and Bill have both\nreported their impressions of the\nconference honestly and accurately,\nand either of them will be happy to\npass on copies of their full-length\nreports to anyone who is interested in\nthe NUS. They can both be contacted\nvia the FELIX Office.\nEGM and JCR\nToday at 12.30 pm there will be an\n'Extraordinary General Meeting' of\nICU in the JCR where the Union's response to the College's plans for the\nrefectory reorganisation will\n(hopefully) be decided. Despite a series of prominent news items in\nFELIX it seems that most students\nare still oblivious to the controversy\nwhich has arisen since the switch of\nthe JCR and the Main Dining Hall\nwas halted. Jackie has written at\nlength about the issue on page 4, and\nhas given a useful summary of \"the\nstory so far.\" It may be that the\nmeeting will decide that the situation\nas it stands is the most desirable.\nWhatever the outcome it is\nimperative that the Union officers\nshould have, and be seen to have, the\nsupport of the student body on this\nissue. If you v n fue your Union please\nmake every effort to turn up to\ntoday's meeting.\nICredits\nYet again this is a much thinner issue\nthan I would have hoped to produce.\nThis week we have had only two days\nto prepare FELIX since Monday and\nTuesday were taken up with a training course on our new typesetter.\nOn Wednesday morning, after as\nmuch copy as possible had been keyed\ninto the new machine the previous\nevening, the power unit failed and we\nhad to revert to using the old model.\nYesterday afternoon FELIX printer\nSteve Shackell had to collect a box of\nplates from Kings Cross Station after\nthe Print Unit ran out and our regular\nsuppliers did not have them in stock.\nIn short, it's been much the same as\nusual. Particular thanks, therefore, to\nJudith Hackney, Chris Martin, Chris\nEdwards, \"he whose name I cannot\nmention\", Nigel Whitfield and Pip pa Salmonfor bailing me out once again.\nThanks also to Kamala Sen, Dave\nBurns, Bill Goodwin, Gail Turner,\nNeil Mottram, Sundi, Liz Holford,\nAlex McNeil, RichardBleasdale, Pete\nWilson, Adrain Johnson, Jackie\nPeirce, Steve Shackell and Rose\nAtkins.\nDavid Jones.\nFELIX is published by the Editor tor and on\nbe halt of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit.

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday January 23rd198712 Goosen for the gander\nTuesday's meeting of the\nConservative Society was cancelled\nat the last minute. Mr Peter Goosen,\nthe Third Secretary at the South\nAfrican Embassy, was unable to\nattend, as he had food poisoning.\nDespite this, and the apparent\nsecrecy surrounding the visit, a sizeable number of protestors\nturned up outside room 139 in the\nHuxley Building.\nDave Bur b age, ConS oc Chairman, said that there had been\nthe usual amount of publicity for the\nevent, but the Union Office and\nCollege Security were not aware of\nthe talk until the FELIX Office\nphoned them for comment.\nFELIX visited Mr Goosen at\nSouth Africa House on Wednesday,\nwhere he said that he is still very\nwilling to come and talk. Mr\nGoosen asserted that there is a \"large amount of confusion\"\namong South\" Africans as to why\ninternational pressure on their\ncountry is increasing now, when the\npace of reform is also quickening,\nLondon colleges have announced a campaign to protest against the\nGovernment's policy on Grants,\nBenefits and Housing (GBH). The\ntwo week campaign which is\nplanned to begin on February 9th is\ndesigned to increase the public's awareness of the issues. It will\nfeature leafleting, picketing, campus\noccupation and a major march.\nA spokesman for the IC\ndelegation to the GB H Committee\nsaid the meeting had been very\nuseful, and added that IC Union\nshould stage a24 hour work-in to\nsupport the campaign.\nand told FELIX that the\nGovernment is committed to the\nabolition of Apartheid, free\ngovernment and a universal\nfranchise. On the subject of the\ncreation of a \"New South Africa\",\nhe said \"We feel the ball is very\nfirmly in the court of the radical\ngroups in South Africa\". He\nclaimed that all that is needed to\nbring about the creation of the new\nstate is negotiation, and the\nNational Statutary Council Bill,\ncurrently going through the South\nAfrican Parliament, provides for a forum for these negotiations, which\nwill decide the form of the new\nGovernment.\nSaying that South Africa admits\nthe mistakes of the past, Mr.\nGoosen told FELIX that \" All people should look to the future of\nSouth Africa\" and said that all that\nneeds to be done before negotiations\ncan begin is for the \"terrorist\"\ngroups to renounce violence. There\nis nothing, he claimed, to prevent\nthe first steps occur ing tomorrow.\nResidents of Beit Hall were shocked\nat the appearance of scaffolding\nreaching to the roof of the Old\nHostel on Tuesday. Students were\nnot warned about the scaffolding,\nwhich has been built so that some of\nthe baths can be replaced with\nshowers. Dr John Finley, who has\nbeen the WaFden of Beit for just\nover a year, explained that he was\nonly informed that the work would\ngo ahead at the beginning of the\nweek. It was supposed to have\nhappened before he took up the\npost, he added.\nWhen asked about the security\nOne of the major forces for\nreform is considered by the South\nAfrican Government to be the\ngrowing economy, which necessitates employment of all races\nif enough labour is to be found, and\nMr Goosen said that sanctions\nwould slow down the pace of\nreform, especially in cost-intensive\nareas such as housing; a housing\nshortage means that there has been\nlittle visible effect. About half of the\nblack population in South Africa is\nunder fifteen years old, and it is\nestimated that one million homes\nare needed now, as well as the jobs\nand other facilities that will be\nneeded when these people reach\nadulthood. Mr Goosen stressed to\nFELIX that change will take place\n\"as soon as humanely possible,\" but\npointed out that the imposition of\nsanctions will, in the view of the\nSouth African Government, make\nthe funds necessary for such reform\nvirtually unobtainable.\nOn the African National\nCongress, Mr Goosen said \"We\nimplications, especially for those\nbedrooms which are accessible from\nthe scaffolding, Dr Finley admitted,\n\"Beit Hall has virtually no\nsecurity,\" and said he did not think\nthis would change until students\nwere persuaded to close the doors\nand so on. A sensible thief would use\nthe front door rather than the\nscaffolding, he suggested.\ndon't deny that the ANC was for\nmany years a peaceful organ is ation\", and that it does represent a certain portion of the views of black\nSouth Africans, but he also pointed\nout that the leaders of the ANC have\npublicly condoned the practice of\n'neck lacing', whereby a rubber tyre\nfilled with petrol is placed around\nthe neck of the victim, and then set\nalight, and outlined in graphic detail\nhow death occurs. The continuing\nviolence of the ANC nineteen\npeople were killed by a single car\nbomb in 1983 - and of the other, less\nwell known, organisations, is seen as\nthe obstacle to negotiation.\nMr Goosen's view was that the\nterrorist should leave his gun\noutside, rather than bring it in to the\nconference room with him.\nIn closing he told FELIX that he\nwould be willing to come and field\nquestions from anti-apartheid,\nsupporters, and said that he 'would\nbe over like a shot' as soon as a date\ncould be arranged.\nFever-pitched\nexcitement\nExcitement is reaching fever-pitch\non the run-up to the Great IC Union\n'Push for UL U' Three-legged Pram\nRace, being held on Tuesday.

Six of the\nsessions were 'conference sessions'\nwith the delegates gathered together\nin the main hall, two were 'sector\nmeetings' (the three sectors being\nUniversities, Public Sector Higher\nEducation (Polytechnics), and\nFuther Education). The remaining\nsession was taken up with\n'commissions' workshops where\ndelegates were given a chance to\nquestion members of the National\nExecutive.\nThe conference began with the\nNational President, Vicky Phillips'\nopening remarks.

She argued that the\nconference was getting too large and\ntaking up too much of the time of\nthe NUS, and it was time a study\nwas undertaken in the way the NUS\nworks, how all the sectors fit\ntogether within the NUS and so on.\nShe defended the No-Platform\nca map a ign for racists and fac is ts, held by many student unions and\nthe NUS itself, but warned of the\ndangers of extending it any further,\nto \"anybody we don't agree with\" as\nshe put it.\nThroughout the conference\nindividual delegates regularly\nsuspended 'standing orders' (the\nrules by which the conference is run)\nin order to make some point to the\nrest of the assembly. The issues\nraised included vegetarian meals at\nthe hotel and students rioting in\nFrance; to do this a delegate needed\n50 other delegates in support, and,\ninitially anyway, it seemed that 50\nde le get es could be found to support\nalmost anything. Such in t eruptions occurred so frequently that it\nseriously hindered the running of\nthe conference and resulted in many\ndelays and the loss of various items\noff the agenda. This was very\ndefinitely a case of too much\ndemocracy, and this was a theme all\nthe way through the conference. The\nchairing of the meetings left a little\nto be desired\u2014it was not until the\nImperial at NUS\nImperial College Union left the National Union of Students nearly ten years ago. At the\ntime the NUS was under fire for being undemocratic, expensive, and too concerned with\nparty politics. Last term Chris Martin and Bill Goodwin attended the NUS winter\nconference as observers. Here we present an edited version of their reports of the\nconference.\nlast session that a 'strong' chair took\nover and cleared a lot of business\nout of the way.\nThe Friday evening session had\ntimetabled some of the important\nmotions on 'Housing', 'Student\nFinancial Support' and 'Grants,\nBenefits and Housing'. This rather\nodd situation of having three\nmotions on related subjects was due\nto a difference of emphasis in the\nNUS between the 'soft-left', NOLS\n(the National Organisation of\nLabour Students), and the 'hard\nleft',SSIN (Socialist Students in\nNOLS).\nFirstly, however, a seemingly\ninnocent constitutional change\ncarried over from the afternoon\nsession caused a major row. The\nchange was about the number of\npart time students that are\nequivalent to a full-time student,\nwhen calculating how many\ndelegates to conference a College\nshould have (currently 1 delegate\nper 1,000 'full time equivalent'\nstudents). The change would\ndecrease the number of part-time\nstudents that made up one full-time\nstudent from 10 to 5, thus\nbenefitting the Further Education\nColleges within the NUS who have a large proportion of part-time\nstudents. This was opposed by the\nNational Executive, as it would\nmake the conference bigger and\nmore expensive.\nThen the fun started. They had a vote, and then a count. The motion\nwas not passed by the two-thirds\nmajority it needed, but only missed\nit by a slender margin. There was a request for a re-vote, which was not\nin the constitution, and then there\nwere indicative rulings, a Presidential Ruling, votes about\nvotes etc etc. In the end, about an\nhour later, they decided to have\nanother vote, this time on paper,\nwhich defeated the change by a larger margin. Again this was a case\nfor too much democracy\u2014if the\nNUS had stuck to its own rules, the\nproblem would not have arisen.\nSome delegates were allowed to get\naway with breaking some the rules,\nand the result was chaos.\nA short way into the debate we\nunfortunately had to leave the\nconference; as IC Union was only\npartly sub sidi sing the trip we had to\nleave in order to travel to some\ncheap accommodation some\ndistance away from the conference.\nThis was a definite nuisance and we\nmissed parts of several debates as\nconference went on . From what I could gather afterwards from\ntalking to other delegates, the\n'moderate' motions about opposing\nthe 'Fowler Review', cutting\nHousing Benefit and other Housing\nsupport for students, was passed,\nand the 'Loony Left' ideas like, for\nexample, national ising land\nownership, were th own out. There\nwas a strong feeling that any\ncampaigns should not only be based\naround Higher Education\n(Universities and Polytechnics), but\nshould bring attention to the\nproblems faced by further education\nstudents as well. The motion as\npassed calls for a 'Major Housing\nCampaign'.\nSaturday saw the University\nSector meetings and workshops. I attended a workshop on student\nunion autonomy in Universies, and\ncame across some real horror\nstories\u2014the Vice Chancellor at\nReading, we were told, was trying to\nget a member of the University staff\ninto the Union to control any money\nthe Union paid out. The National\nExecutive were asked to prepare a 'defend your union' pack to collect\ntogether the individual experiences\nof student unions around the\ncountry to circulate to other\nColleges if they are faced with\nsimilar problems.\nSunday saw the 'commissions'\nwhere delegates had a chance to\nquestion members of the National\nExecutive, and from the ones that I attended, they had a hard time of it.\nThe \"fin ace and services\"\ncommission discussed the NUS's annual accounts; they have a large\nproblem in that the amount they\nbudget ted for telephone and travel\nfor their part-time executive\nmembers has been exceeded by a considerable amount because these\nmembers have been doing far more\nwork than they used to in the past,\nthis was part of the reason why they\nundertook to investigate the\nstructure of the NUS.\nElections took place on the\nSunday afternoon to the NUS\nElections Committee, Steering\nCommittee (which looks after the\norganisation of the conferences, etc)\nand a few others. During this a candidate stood up and used his\nelection speech to put forward the\nFederation of Conservative\nStudents' (FCS) position on the\nNUS. He was heckled by the floor,\nand judging by the reputation of\nNUS conferences, this was not\ns uprising. What was s uprising was\nthe number of delegates who\nimmediately afterwards stood up\nand defended the candidate's right\nto have his say the same as everyone\nelse. The hecklers was very definitely\nin the minority.\nFeature FELIX, Friday January 23rd19877 Monday saw 4 hours left to get\nthrough nearly half the business of\nthe conference, due to all the time\nlost becuase of debates overrunning\nand various in t eruptions. First on\nthe agenda was a debate on\neconomic policy\u2014criticising\nGovernment policy and the effect it\nwas having on students, making the\npoint very strongly that education\nwas not an issue that can be taken in\nisolation. The depth the debate\nreached, even in the short time\nallocated to it, indicated that the\nNUS were not just interested in\n'more money for students', but\nrealised that a national organisation\ncampaigning for students must have\na longer term view and a deeper\nunderstanding of the economics and\npolitics of government. To suggest\nthat a debate on economic policy is\nnot rel event to a body representing\nthe interests of 1.4m students\nnationwide in further and higher\neducation, especially since it is the\neconomic policies of the present\ngovernment that are doing so much\ndamage to the education system, is\njust not realistic.\nBy the end of the conference a great deal of useful work had been\ndone, but there could of been more\nif delegates hadn't been to quick to\nin t erupt. If you set up the\ndemocratic structures to allow every\ndelegate to take part in a conference\nthen they are all going to want to\ntake part in that conference. I am\nsure the NUS realise this as well, and\nit must be part of the reason why\nthey are moving to restructure the\nconference. As the NUS has grown\nto represent more and more\nstudents, the number of delegates\nhas grown. There is always going to\nbe a dilemma between the\ndemocratic right of the members to\ntake part in the running of the union\non one hand, and the cost, in terms\nof time and money, of them doing\nthis. The NUS have rightly realised\nthat it is time that they had a rethink about their conferences.\nChris Martin\nBILL GOODWIN\nThe NUS decides its policy at two\nnational conferences. Delegates\nfrom the constituent universities\nand polytechnics are elected by\ncampus\u2014wide ballot to vote on\nbehalf of the students they\nrepresent. Imperial College Union\nExternal Affairs Committee decided\nto send myself and Chris Martin to\nthe 1986 winter conference as\nobservers.\nThe most significant motion was\nthat of Grants, Benefits and\nHousing, on the policy document\n'The Fowler review on Social\nSecurity', which precludes students\nfrom claiming during holiday\nperiods and which was criticised\nbecause it would reduce access to\nhigher education. The Baker review,\nwhich calls for the implementation\nof student loans, was also\ncondemned, and the NUS claim for\na \u00a335 weekly grant for all students in\nfurther education was reaffirmed.\nThe motion on AIDS resolved to\ngive support to the Trevor Higgins\ntrust, which is researching the\ndisease, and to undertake an\neducational programme designed to\nremove the 'gay disease' prejudice\nand to promote 'safe sex'. The\npolicy also seeks to ensure that\nstudents and staff suffering from\nAIDS or possessing AIDS antibodies should be free to\ncontinue their work as normal, and\nthat confidential treatment should\nbe provided.\nMy initial impressions were that\nthe organisation of the conference\nwas very good indeed\u2014surpassing\nGUC (University of London) and\nICU's UGMs by a long way.\nUnfortunately, as the conference\nprogressed, a huge proportion of the\nconference was wasted by delegates\nsuspending standing orders at every\nopportunity. This facility allowed\ndelegates, with the approval of 50\nmembers of conference, to halt the\nproceedings in order, for example,\nto make speeches or have in directive votes in support of their pet issues.\nAlthough many of the issues raised\nwere important, the facility was\nconsist ant ly abused by delegates\nper suing the course of one-up man ship. As a result there was no\ntime to hear the guest speakers, or to\nconsider emergency motions on\nsubjects such as US involvement in\nNicaragua, cuts in art courses,\nBarclays' continuing interests in\nSouth Africa, or to debate the\nExecutive's reports. I was\ndisappointed at the way major\nmotions had to be rushed through\nwithout adequate debate. It was\ndifficult to see how democracy\ncould operate in a situation which\ndid not give delegates time fully to\nunderstand what they were voting\non. I was not surprised when one\ndelegate, almost in tears, told the\nconference that she didn't have a clue what was going on; she was\ngiven a sympathetic round of\napplause by the conference.\nI was disappointed, given the\nconference's support for 'oppressed\nminorities', that delegates should\nchoose to heckle the few speakers\nwho admitted to being members of\nthe Federation of Conservative\nStudents.\nIn conclusion, there is much\nwhich could be done to improve the\neffectiveness of NUS conferences; in\na sense the NUS is too democratic\nfor its own good. Whether the\nsituation will be improved by the\nmuch\u2014publicised restructuring\nremains to be seen.\nIs the NUS worth joining? I think\nthere is a definite need for a national\nstudent organisation. It has to be\nasked, though, whether the NUS has\nlost its way?\nCHRIS MARTIN\nThe NUS is making great efforts to\nrepresent all the students in this\ncountry; not just the university and\npolytechnic students, but all those in\nFurther Education Colleges as well.\nThis is only right, especially since a lot of these students are great deal\nworse off than university students.\nSuggesting that there should be\nseperate national unions for each of\nthe different sectors is like\nsuggesting that there should be a seperate union for rich and poor\nstudents. Splitting the student\ncampaigning can only be a bad\nthing, and can weaken the overall\nposition of student representation.\nOne thing you may have expected\nin this report is accounts of political\nin-fighting within the 'left' groups at\nthe conference. In fact, on the\nconference floor, there was very\nlittle. The arguments and debates\nseemed to centre around issues, and\nnot dogma. Outside the conference\nhall, however, there were as many\npolitical groups all lined up and\ntrying to give you a bit of paper. The\nabsence of party-political slang ing matches on the floor of the\nconference was s uprising, as it was\nnot what I had been led to expect. Of\ncourse political man ou ve rings happened behind the scenes, but the\nissues themselves, it seemed, were\nprimary on the conference floor.\nShould IC join the NUS?\nMost of the people I talked to at\nthe conference seemed amazed that\na College the size of Imperial could\nget by without the NUS. There was\nno shortage of criticism of the NUS\nat the conference, indeed delegates\nseemed to revel in it, but in spite of\nthis, I did not hear one delegate or\nCollege mention that they were\nthinking about d is affiliating. The\nfew d is affiliation ballots that have\ntaken place recently have all\noverwhelmingly supported the\nNUS. I never cease to be amazed by\nthe 'knee-jerk' anti-NUS reaction of\nsome students, who while knowing\nnext to nothing about the NUS,\ncriticise it only because that is what\nthe previous year did. Since I have\nbeen at College, there has been a complete lack of reasoned factual\ndebate about the NUS; students\nhere, apparently, appear to rely on\nthe prejudices.\nI am not going to get into the\narguments about why IC should be\nin the NUS; all I will ask is this\u2014Is\nthe NUS is so bad, why is, almost\nwithout exception, every other\nstudent and Student Union in this\ncountry in the NUS, and Imperial\noutside?\n\n"

    "content": "Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday January 23rd19874 JCR-to be or not to be?\nDeputy President Jackie Peirce puts the Union's view\nforward on the fight for the J CR. IC Union By-Laws state \"The\nGoverning Body has set aside, free of\nrent, certain rooms for the use of the\nUnion, including \"Junior Common\nRoom\u2014Sherfield Building (during\nterm time)\".\nHow is it then that Junior\nCommon Room (JCR) has\napparently, and without consent,\nbecome part of the College refectory\nsystem? Two years ago ambitious\nplans to re vital is e the catering in the\nSherfield Building were hatched.\nThese centred around the relocation\nof all the catering facilities on level 2.\nThis required the swopping of the\nJCR with the Main Dining Hall\n(MDH).\nOn level 2 the main theme would\nbe a large food hall, roughly where\nthe Buttery is, but stretching into the\nSenior Common Room/Senior\nDining Room (SCR/SDR). This\nwould serve students and staff, and\nwould have seating areas in the\npresent SCR and JCR. In one\ncorner of the JCR a take-away\nburger bar, \"QT\", would be built.\nDownstairs the new JCR would be\nformed.\nThe agreement was made. All\nconversion work would be carried\nout so that both areas would be\nready simultaneously. A number of\nproblems were identified; the new\nJCR would be smaller, conference\nbookings would be affected,\nmeaning a slight reduction in the\nUnion's income (we get an average\nof \u00a312Ka year from conference\nbookings).\nThen things started going wrong.\nOn November 15 1985 the then\nUnion President, Carl Burgess, was\nforced to write to the College\nSecretary stating that unless the\ncompletion of both areas was\nsimultaneous, the deal was off. Yet\nover Summer 1986 the only work\ncarried out was some refurbishment\nin the SCR; in the JCR the bar was\nmoved and QT was built in its place,\nand a new bar put on level 1.\n\"QT' opened for the first time\njust before the start of the autumn\nterm this year. Almost immediately\nit was a great success. Trade was\nsoon at levels predicted in the final\ntargets for next year. Then\nsomebody noticed \" QT' wasn'ta take-away after all. If you stuck it in\na room full of seats, people sat in\nthem to eat their burgers! All further\nplans were halted whilst College\nwent away to decide that, actually it\nreally wanted the Main Dining Hall\nand the Junior Common Room for\nrefectories.\nThe plan then became M DH on\nlevel 1 and on level 2, \"QT\" would\nhave half of the JCR, only the\nButtery would be turned into a mini\nfood hall serving into the SCR and\nJCR.\nAt this stage we found that no\nfood hall would serve into the JCR.\nWhich meant everyone, including\nstudents, would be going into the\nSCR, ergo JCR. The academic staff\nprotested loudly, with the result\nthat, if their members' poll agrees,\nthe SCR will not only be restored\nbut enlarged and refined.\nSo now we are at the stage where\n(possibly!);\n1) QT gets half of the JCR during\nevery day.\n2) The staff SCR expands into the\nButtery and gets revamped.\n3) The Main Dining Hall stays\nwhere it is, with the addition of grill\nand salad bars.\n4) The Conference Office loses\nmore space, we lose more money.\n5) The student body gets...new\nceiling tiles! and loses effective\ncontrol of its largest room.\n(Are you following this?)\nOn the lost income, College has\nsaid that can be made up in\nincreased sub vent ion but booking\ncharges are expected to rise by 10%\nnext year. Will that be mirrored in\nincreased sub vent ion? And already\nwe have lost around \u00a32K in 1986\nand will certainly lose more in 1987.\nBut income, however desperately\nneeded, is not the main issue. We\nhave been losing space left,right and centre and now we are losing the\nJCR. It has even been threatened\nthat, if we block these plans, we will\nlose the Southside Gym instead!\nIn an effort to halt this, a proposal\nwas put to College that the outlets in\nthe JCR became student controlled.\nThe answer was no handing over of\nQT, no handing over of the bar, no\nsay in when either should be opened\nor closed. And the reason: students\nobviously like things just the way\nthey are, they are voting with their\nfeet. Over 2000 transactions a day is\nsaying this is the right solution.\nJackie\nPresident's Piece\nSorry this is so short\u2014this seems to\nbe the busiest week since the start\nof October. Just a couple of\nthings...\nJunior Common Room\u2014yet again\nPlease, please, please come to the\nExtraordinarily Exciting General\nMeeting this lunchtime, 12.30 in\nthe JCR. It's absolutely necessary\nthat Jackie, Dave and I have a firm\nmandate on what action we ought\nto be taking over our Common\nRoom. Come and tell us what to\ndo.\nUL U Day of Action\nNext Tuesday, 27th January, is the\nDay of Action over the proposed\n50% cut to UL U. Please watch out\nfor more details\u2014read the leaflets,\nsign the petitions and take part in\nany last-minute actions that may be\ntaking place!\nLesbian and Gay Rights\nLast Monday Council co-opted\nRobert Daniels to look into ways in\nwhich the Union can improve\nlesbian and gay rights and welfare,\nand to provide a contact for any\nlesbian, gay\u2014or other\u2014students\nwith problems or relevant\nsuggestions. You can contact\nRobert via the Union office. If\nyou've any comments or queries\nabout the Union's plans or views\non the subject, or about Council's decision, I suggest that you come\nand see me\u2014as I proposed co-opting Robert in the first place, and\nwill be working with him.\nChristine\nGay or\nLesbian?\nLast Monday, ICU Council co-opted me (Robert Daniel) onto\nCouncil, the ICU Welfare\nCommittee and the College Welfare\nCommittee. My position is to\ninvestigate how best the interests of\nlesbians arid gays at IC can be served\nby the Union. The Council co-opted\nme because I first put the suggestion\nto Christine Taig. We decided on 6\nareas requiring attention:\u2014\n1. The homophobic atmosphere at\nCollege.\n2. Provision of lesbian and gay\nsocial events.\n3. Provision of advice and\ninformation for lesbian and gay\nstudents.\n4. Representation of lesbians and\ngays on issues within College.\n5. Liaison with other lesbian and\ngay organisations.\n6. Provision of long term\ncommitment to lesbian and gay\nrights.\nHaving stuck my neck out this far\nI have decided to set up a Lesbian\nand Gay Society which I hope will\nbe well attended. Perhaps this way I will also gain other peoples views on\nthe matter. Keep an eye out for\nposters detailing the launch of the\nSociety, hopefully early next week.\nI would also greatly value letters\nfrom lesbians and gays (in total\nconfidence) with any suggestions\nabout things they feel need to be\ndone, and all offers of help would be\ngreatly appreciated. I can be\ncontacted at the Union Office by\ninternal mail\u2014either addressed to\nme personally or to Lesbian/Gay\nWelfare.\nLastly there will be a questionnaire circulating College\nsometime soon, and apparently one\nquestion will be on sexuality. Since\nthese questionnaires will be the most\ncomprehensive recent survey of the\nCollege population it would be very\ngood if an accurate figure could be\nput on the number of homosexuals\nat IC. My estimate (based on\nnational statistics) is 500. If you are\na lesbian or gay student make sure\nyou get counted becuase this will\nhelp identify how great the need for\na Union Officer is.\nRobert Daniels\nFOR SALE\nHonda CB175 (Lreg)\nBuckled front wheel,\ndead battery;\notherwise in generally\nsound condition\n(see under Huxley)\n\u00a3 6 5\nContact Andy (int 6987)\nFROM THE ACCOMMODATION\nOFFICE\nThe Accommodation List will now be\nprinted on Mondays, Wednesdays and\nFridays at 3pm.

The used\nduring the term will be a high\nquality Assa system, which will be\nput out of action when the rooms\nare let in the vacation and the\ncheaper locks used. The changeover\nwill take two or. three keys and is\nintended to improve the security of\nthe Assa keys. Welfare Officer, Tom\nMeliar-Smith estimated' that the\nlocks will be installed by the summer\nterm.\nThe new locks will be\naccompanied with better key\nsecurity in general. Even the\nsub wardens and warden will no\nlonger hold master keys, although\nthe warden will have access to one.\nAnother change will be that\nstudents who lose keys will have to\npay \u00a345 for a new lock rather than\npaying for a new key as at present.\nDespite the greatly increased cost,\nthe decision was welcomed by\nstudent members Ian Howgate and\nMr Meliar-smith, who have\ncampaigned strongly for increased\nsecurity.\ndrought\nAngry residents have presented a petition to College Secretary John\nSmith, complaining about the lack\nof water and heating in Weeks\nHall. The residents have been\nwithout water between 10am and\n12pm since January 15th. The problem is due to burst pipes\ncausing a reduction in pressure and\nthe lack of a pump to supply water\nto the storage tank. This has been\naggravated by the recent\ninstallation of water meters of the\nwrong size, which constrict the\nflow. Showers, sinks and toilets are\ncurrently unusable -and students\nhave been forced to obtain water\nfrom fire hoses and to take showers\nin the sports centre or very late at\nnight.\nStudent Accomodation Officer\nLesley Gillingham told FELIX\n\"The situation to the students\ninvolved is totally deplorable and\nwe hope it will be resolved as\nquickly as possible\".\nSouthside\nThe Student Residences Committee\nfinally decided on the future of\nTizard and Selkirk Halls' kitchens\non Wednesday. A small-scale survey\nof the residents of these Halls\nproduced a majority in favour of\ngallery-level kitchens with fridges in\ncupboards on staircases, and this\nscheme, which was favoured by the\nwardens, was accepted without\nfurther argument.\nOur Steve\nmakes it\nThumbs up from Steve \"Ready\nwhen you are\" Shackell, FELIX offset litho operator, as he sets off on\nan emergency mission to collect a box of plates from King's Cross\nstation. Steve is 27.\nMPs attack Government\nA Parliamentary select committee\nhas called for a significant increase\nin student grants. A report last week\nby the committee accused the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience of giving misleading\ninformation about the grants\nsituation and crit is is ed it for failing\nto research student costs.\nWhilst the committee did not\ndiscuss student loans, it decided that\nsome form of award system is\nessential to national needs. The\nreport calls for a decrease in\nparental contributions and\nprovision for student welfare\nbenefits.\nThe MPs, chaired by William Van\nStraubenzee, attacked the DES for\ngiving misleading information\nabout student' maintenance costs.\nAs recently as 1981 the Department\nhad stated that grants were based on\nan objective assessment of costs\nwhich was not the case. There is no\nresearch unit in the DES to monitor\nstudent costs and information\nappears to come from parties with a vested interest.\nHarry Greenway, Conservative\nMP, said \"it is extraordinary that\nthey do not have a research\ndepartment. They are always about\nthree years out of date.\"\nIt is not certain what effect the\nselect committee's report will have\nupon the grant settlement for next\nacademic year or upon the\nGovernment's own enquiry whose\nchairman, Junior Education\nMinister, George Walden, is\npresently in the United States,\nexamining its system of student\nsupport. It does appear to be part of\na move towards a more favourable\nattitude amongst the Government\ntowards student claims of hardship.\nRed faces in College\nIt was red faces all round in College\nSecurity after they installed a high\nsecurity metal gate to protect the\nNat West Bank. The ASSA lock\nwith which they chose to secure the\ngate has a latch device on the inside\nof the doors. Unfortunately the gap\nbetween the bars is wide enough for\na hand to reach round and open the\ndoor.\nWhen FELIX pointed this out to\nCollege Security Chief, Geoff\nReeves, he announced his intention\nto install a magnetic lock. He added\nthat a similar lock would be\ninstalled on the door to the Quiet\nRoom in order to protect the\nHolland Club.

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday January 23rd19873 Rag Conference 1987\nFrom 6th9 th January, four of us from\nImperial Rag descended on\nLoughborough, scene of this year's Rag Conference, where we collected\nideas and information on how to run\nRag more efficiently and enjoy ably. The conference consisted of sessions\nduring the day and social events in the\nevening, and the thirty-five Rags\nrepresented participated enthusiastically (sometimes over-enthusiastically) in both. Man Tai was\nmade to attend the discussion on effective committee work, and Nigel\nBaker, Rag Treasurer, at last\ndiscovered how to deal with VAT (ig-nore it!) whilst Mike Copperwhite's. favourite sessions seemed to be those\nspent in the bar...\nOne of many guest speakers was\nVicky Phillips, who spoke on Rag's relationship with the NUS, but since\nRag doesn't have any relations with\nthe NUS this wasn'ta lot of use. NUS\nwas considered to be a political body\nand the unanimous feeling was that\nRag should be apolitical, although the\nsubject of relations with individual\nstudent unions provoked a more\nheated discussion. We are obviously\nlucky in that we clash very little with\nours.\nA session on Rag Mags saw Imperial in the firing line for having a mag with traditionally the sickest and\nmost offensive material, but a number\nof delegates informed us that they still\nconsidered our mag to be the most\noriginal. Having read several other\nRag Mags (which seem very much\nlike one mag duplicated several times)\nI must confess to agreeing with them,\nbeen taken and more thought will go\ninto the content for next year's mag.\nOn the second evening we were\nentertained by two very impressive\nprofessional acts \u2014 Sally Barker and\nTom McEwan - who we're going to\ntry and book for IC in the near future.\nLook out for them \u2014 they're well\nworth seeing. In the Rag Revue on the\nlast night we were given the chance\nto display our astounding thespian\nskills, as well as getting drenched in\nthe ensuing water-fight.\nAll in all, we learnt a great deal\nfrom the conference and if you want\nto know more about it, or simply want\nto take a more active role in Rag\nyourself, then come along to the next\nand whilst not condoning offensive\nmaterial, it has to be remembered that\nour mag is not sold on the streets as\nothers are. However, the point has\nmeeting which will be advertised in\nFELIX.\nEmma Barrett\nMet and Mat I FELIX\nRetraction;\nIC Tomb\nHorror\nLast week's FELIX carried a story\nentitled \"IC Tomb Horror\" as one\nof the back page news items. This\narticle was a spoof news story, and\n\"reported\" the deaths of 3 students\nin a Lexham Garden flat. Neither\nthe positioning nor the\npresentation of the article made it\nclear that it was not a genuine news\nstory. I had originally planned to\ninclude this in a humour section,\nand to include a photograph which\nwould convey instantly the tone of\nthe article. Because of a lack of time\nin the later stages of production,\nthe story appeared as straight news.\nI accept that on first reading it was\nnot absolutely clear that the article\nwas not serious, and I apologise if\nanyone was offended by its\ninclusion.\nDavid Jones\nMore Groping\nYou may remember the argument\nthe infamous Groper family had a while back about the garden at\nLurch mansion. Well, not contented\nwith living peaceably for a while,\nthey've come to blows again over\nthe orchard. After Grandma\nGroper 'croaked' a few months\nback there was much ex c it ment over\nwho would get what from the old\nbat's last will and testament. But,\nbeing the grouchy old goat that she\nA PAP was, she thought she'd leave a few\nargument causing clauses, since she\nknew exactly what reaction they'dpr evoke. The orchard was to be\ndevi ded equally between Mr. and\nMrs. Groper and the two brats,\nsimple enough you'd think,\nespecially as the orchard is square in\nshape. The problem is that there are\nfour apple trees and four pear trees\nin the orchard arranged as shown.\nOf course each member of the\nfamily insists on having one of each\ntype of tree in their share. Not only\nthat, but they also insist that the\norchard be devi ded between the four\nof them so that each share has\nexactly the same shape, as well as the\nsame area!\n'Impossible' you say? That's what\nevil Granny thought, but she was\nmistaken. This week's problem is to\nstop the plates flying at Lurch\nmansion by showing how the\norchard can be devi ded up as\nrequired. Answers, comments, new\nproblems..etc to me at the FELIX\noffice by 1.00pm Wednsday. \u00a35\nprize for a randomly selected\nwinner, as usual.\nBarrel of beer - solution\nYes, you all guessed it (well most of\nyou anyway), the only way of\nsolving the problem is to empty the\nbarrel! Horror of horrors! But the\nrules don't say where you have to to\npour the beer, and into the gullets of\nthe assembled crowd is perfectly\nlegal. Admittedly the people at the\nstall weren't exactly pleased when\nwe suggested this , but we promised\nto pay for the barrel if we didn't complete the challenge. There are\nseveral ways of doing it once you\nrealise that you have to empty\n(drink) the barrel. Here's one of\nthem. Fill up the 5-pint; fill the 3-pint from the 5-pint and drink the\ncontents of the 3-pint leaving two\npints; transfer these to the 3-pint;\nrefill the 5-pint, giving seven pints in\nall. Now the fun part, drink the rest\nof the barrel! Empty the seven pints\nback into the barrel; fill the 3-pint\nand emt py it into the 5-pint; fill the\n3-pint from the barrel again, leaving\none pint in the barrel; fill the 5-pint\nfrom the 3-pint leaving one pint in\nthe 3-pint; drink the contents of the\n5-pint and, finally, fill it from the\nbarrel leaving one pint in each glass.\nLots of correct solutions to this\none (I gave too many hints, I suspect) out of which Steve Porter,\nComp 2, was selected as the \u00a35 prize\nwinner, well done.\nPyramid problems - solution\nThis did cause a lot of problems.\nEven with last week's clue I still only\ngot three correct answers. The\nproblem of finding the pyramid's comparative volumes can easily be\nsolved if you can construct one from\nthe other. It happens that you can\nconstruct a large tetrahedron from\nfour half-sized ones, and two half-sized square pyramids, as shown\nbelow.\nThe two square-base pyramids\nare put base to base forming the\noctahedron in the centre, with the\ntetrahedra forming the corners. The\nlarge pyramid shown has twice the\ndimensions of the smaller ones and\nthus eight times the volume. So we\nget, simply, 4T+2 P=8T, and thus\nP=2T. It was pointed out in several\nanswers that it's also possible to\nbuild a square based pyramid from 4\ntetrahedra and 6 small, square based\npyramids, but as it's completely\nimpossible to draw I 'll leave that as\na supplementary problem for the\nrest of you! The winner was Simon\nHall, Physics 3, who I must say signs\nhis letters in the most intimate of\nterms! Collect your\u00a35 after Monday\nlunchtime, please.\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday January 23rd19879 Theatre\nMiss Julie - Strindburg\nJudgement - Kafka\nIntimacy - Sartre\nAt the Cafe Theatre of the Bear and\nStaffpub, 37 Charing Cross Road.\nThis triple bill of works by Classic\nwriters is an ambitious undertaking by\nthe Artuad Company and provides\none of the most interesting theatrical\nprogrammes on in London at the\nmoment.\n\"Miss Julie\" tells of how a Count's valet, Jean, exploits the infatuation\nthat Julie (his masters mad daughter)\nhas for him in order to get enough\nmoney to get away and start a new\nlife. The play is performed frequently\nand can be tedious and clich ed, but\nby using updated language, Paul\nHick's production remains fresh and\noriginal though out, and this is helped\nby Adam Maxwell's portrayal of Jean\nas laid-back yet calculating. However\nthere are times when the play flags\nand Shane Valey sometimes goes over\nthe top as the insane Julie.\n\"Judgement\" is Micheal Almaz's adaptation of Kafka's writings dealing\nwith his early life and emotional\nconflicts over his dying father, his\nfiancee whom he does not love and\nhis suppressed homosexuality. The\nplay never reaches any satisfactory\ndramatic climax, but does portray\nKafka's isolation and confusion with\nsubtlety and clarity.\nIt is notoriously difficult to write a convincing female role, let alone an\nall-woman play. Hence Jean-Paul\nSatre's \"Intimacy\" is a gem. Two\nbest-friends have man-trouble; Lulu\nis about to leave her impotent husband\nfor a young lover, and Rirette is now\nalone. The play studies their\nindividual feelings, and what happens\nwhen Lulu finally leaves Henri, and\nthe sexual attraction they have for one\nanother but that they try to ignore.\n\"Intamacy\" produced some of the\nmost imaginative staging of the\nevening, and I found it most\nenjoyable.\nAll three productions deal with the\nstrong sexual drives that can force\npeople into making unwise, even\nfatal, decisions. Despite some dubious\nacting, all were memorable and\nrewarding versions of fine plays. The\nTheatre programme changes regularly\nand plays can be seen singularly or\ntogether, but it is not only the actual\nshows that make it well worth a visit,\nthe theatre itself and the pub beneath\nare excellent and the whole\natmosphere is warm, friendly and\ninviting.\nLiz Holford\nRoad - The Royal Court Theatre\nRoad has returned to the Royal Court\nTheatre for short run from the 19\nJanurary to the 28 February. It is\nshort considering the amount of effort\nthat turns the whole of the stalls of\nthe theatre into a walk around stage.\nJim Cartwright's play ended another\nshort run last summer after it was\ntransferred from the much smaller\ntheatre upstairs. I saw the play last\nJune when Eddie Tenpole, of Tenpole\nTudor and Sex Pistols background\ntook the leading part, this time it stars\nIan Dury as a man of the street in this\nsmall Lancashire town. The play, as\nit rambles on from scenes inside\nhouses on a council estate, eavesdrops\non short snatches taken from the lives\nof the inhabitants. It is an attempt to\nrecreate and follow the lives of people\nin an informal walk-around manner.\nOne simply walks on and around the\naction, never more than six feet away\nfrom the dialogue. The audience too\nbecomes part of the play; I made a terrible acting debut when I had to\ndance passionately with ? young girl!\nI should also mention how\ndisconcerting it is to have people\nacting in front of your face, to speak\nand look into your eyes, without the\nglare of stage-lights. The whole play\nis two-way, sometimes the audience\ncan't look at its own shame of being\nthere, so intimately involved. At other\ntimes the cast look to be enjoying this\nmagni fi cant play too much to be\nconsistently depraved.\nMore than that, if you like Ian\nDury, its likely to be the closest you\never get to him.\nRichard Bleasdale\nFilm\nRocinante\nThis film made by the Cinema\nAction group is a rather strange\nmixture of fantasy, fact, illusion and\nrealism with no obvious running\ntheme.\nIt centres around a character\ncalled Bill (John Hurt) who leaves\nhis projections of landscapes in a derelict cinema and goes in search of\nthe real thing in his aimless\nmeandering s around the Wild West\ncountry of England he is trailed by a present day jester, whose strange\nappearance and uncanny powers are\nwell portrayed by Ian Dury.\nBill crosses paths with Jess\n(Maureen Douglas) who is trying to\ninfiltrate the computer network of\nthe Coal Board shortly after the\nminer's strike. Both she and the\njester seem to be enticing Bill to\nadventure with their strange words\nand dark secrets, but rather\ndisappointingly nothing actually\ncomes of it.\nHowever, if you don't go into the\ncinema expecting Crocodile Dundee\nand don't try to derive too much\nmeaning from particular events, the\nfilm's rather bizzar e characters and\nits almost surreal images can be\nappreciated.\nOnce you realise that Bill does not\nhave and ulterior motive or reason\nfor his actions and that you know\njust as much about what he's doing\nas he does, it is possible to identify\nwith him; then, you can just sit back\nand enjoy the spectacular views of\nJhe English West Country. Viv\nHeavenly\nPursuits\nIn 'Heavenly Pursuits', Tom Conti\nplays a remedial teacher (Vic\nMatthews) in Glasgow, whose\na e theist views seem to make him a prime target for a whole host of\n'miracles' designed to convert the\nun believing. The concept of\nmiracles is not new to him as he\nteaches at a small Catholic school\nnamed after Edith Semple, a former\n'miracle worker' who lived at the\nturn of the century. Vic struggles\nhard to quash rumours that he is the\nnext Edith Semple, aided by fellow\nteacher Ruth Chancellor (Helen\nMirren), and instead channels his\nenergy into improving his pupils'\nliteracy.\nMuch as I like Tom Conti, he gets\nthe film off to a bad start by\nwandering around like a love-sick\npuppy. However, he soon redeems\nhimself and gives a good\nperformance as an ordinary man\ndriven mad by 'miracle hysteria',\nHelen Mirren is pleasingly cast as\nRuth, good at below-the-belt\nretorts. The story-line however\nmeanders along and at times\ndisappears completely.\n'Heavenly Pursuits' is a harmless\ncomedy that will give an evening's entertainment, although personally\nI would not rush out to see it.\nHelena Russell\n\n"
