Weathering\nwith you was released three years after his biggest success and is his fifth film.\nThe story revolves around a teenage boy who ran\naway from home to settle in a rainy Tokyo. There, he\nmeets a \u201csunshine girl\u201d that can make the rain stop and\ncall for the sun.\nFrom reading the premises and knowing our current\nsituation regarding climate change, it is quite surprising that the movie does not care a bit about the climate\ncrisis. The fact that Tokyo is under such heavy rains is\nonly treated as a prop for the plot to exist which I think\nis a missed opportunity to talk about bigger issues. Indeed, the film is very much more focused on the personal issues of its characters rather than the big picture.\nHowever, one of the strongest suits of the movie is\nits visuals. The city of Tokyo has never been depicted\nso beautifully. Every drop of water glimmers in this\nmovie from the dew to the close-up shots of rain; the\ninteraction of light and water is delightful and shows\nhigh-technical skills and an incredible attention to de-tails. I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the movie,\nwhich is exceptionally soft, melancholic, and poetic.\nSomecallWeatheringwithyouthespiritualsuccessor\nof Your name. If you have seen the latter, then you will\nsee a lot of similarities which is one of the biggest complains most people have about this movie: they are far\ntoo similar. Combined with the fact that Weathering\nwith you is considered not to be on par with its prede-cessor, it has caused the movie to be a bit underwhelm-ing.\nOverall, the movie has a big under-exploited potential as the premises are good but as the story progresses\nit lacks consistency: the characters are not that memorable and, without the little twist of the sunshine girl,\nit is an average story about everyday life and falling in\nlove for the first time. If you have never seen Shinkai\u2019s\nmovies, then I would recommend you start with Your\nname instead of Weathering with you. If you like Makoto Shinkai\u2019s works or you like fluffy romance anime\nmovie, you will enjoy Weathering with you .\nDirectedby: Makoto Shinkai\nStarring: Kotaro Daigo, Nana Mori, Tsubasa\nHonda, Sakura Kiryu, Sei Hiraizumi, Y\u00fbki Kaji\nFRIDAY 18TH MARCH 2022\nOur planet\nDocumentary recommendation\nNarratedby: David Attenborough\nEva Borras Film Editor\nThis documentary series released in 2019 consists\nof eight episodes aiming to educate the viewer\non various aspects of climate change and how the\nenvironment has been affected by humans. The first\nepisodeconcentratesontheplanet\u2019sdiversity,moreofa\nvisually beautiful representation of the wildlife in both\nthe ocean and the driest areas.\nThe rest of the seven episodes explain the life in\nevery possible environmental condition on the planet,\nranging from the frozen areas (where you can observe\npenguins and the whale population in their everyday\nlife) to the jungles and rainforest which are home to an\nincredible number of species of birds.\nStreaming on Netflix, Our Planet is a perfect watch\nif you are interested in understanding and learning\nabout the climate change crisis.

    "content": "We travelled what seemed like the length of\nExhibition Road to finally get to Metric. The\nsnaking queue motivated us to finally ask Felix for a\npress pass. Whether that would mean anything was\nstill uncertain, but it would definitely make it easier\nto report fairly. What can I say? We\u2019re committed\njournalists.\nThe lengthy wait to actually get inside Metric\nmeant that the first sound of The Revelry that I heard\nwas muffled through the windows as I waited outside in the cold like a little\nVictorian orphan. Walking\ninto the packed bar, the band\nare already halfway through\ntheir set and have managed\nto get a reasonably large\ncrowd standing and dancing\nto their songs, averting my\nfears of awkward, seated\naudiences like those in some\nheats at Reynolds. While I\nwaited for a drink, the band\npowered through some more\nMandopop; in hindsight, a\nrefreshing break from the\nnon-stop rock that came later in the night. The only\nlet down of the set was not down to the band themselves but down to lacklustre sound mixing that resulted in a muddy mix. I wish I could have been there\nfor the whole set because what I saw of The Revelry\nwas like nothing I\u2019d seen a band play before but something I definitely want to see again, especially after\nthe last song (which Tara told me later was called\n\u2018Nunchucks\u2019). The energy of the band was unrivalled\n(until Tremolo) with everyone bouncing around on\nstage during the final song which included one of my\nfavourite parts of any performance all night - a piano\nbreakdown that had perfect contrast to the hyped\nchorus that followed.\nIf you\u2019re all caught up with our articles, then you\nmay have picked up on my admiration for Quadronaut. Exceptionally talented, passionate, grounded,\nand skilled, Quadronaut offers the audience a sound\nthat isn\u2019t just defined by its timbre, but also by its\nemotion. While I\u2019ve received a lot of, let\u2019s say, feedback for that opinion, I think it\u2019s definitely something I stand by. Not the idea that Quadronaut is\nworth the vote, but rather the extent to which the\nband\u2019s overall demeanour plays a part in experiencing\nthe performance. Quadronaut mounted the stage to\nan impressive applause and began their set.\n\u2018Time\u2019 by Pink Floyd was played similarly to its\npremiere at the heats, beginning with an arhythmic\npercussion bound together by a foundational bass\nsequence. The band leaned into Pink Floyd\u2019s reverbed\npsychedelic sound without overpowering the vocals\n\u2013 which, although not their most prominent feature,\nare definitely elevated by the harmonies. \u2018Don\u2019t Bring\nMe Down\u2019 relied on these well-rehearsed harmonies,\nprimarily sung by the pianist and lead vocalist. Although the falsetto when singing \u201cgrooss\u201d wavered,\nthe band definitely emphasised\nthe elements of the song that\nmake it so damn catchy. A new\nsong on the setlist, The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u2018Sympathy for the\nDevil\u2019, was the first of their set\nthat didn\u2019t have every element\nfound in the song. Normally\npopulated with the West African shekere, maracus (shakers\nin Latin music) and congas,\nQuadronaut brought out the\n\u201860s rock elements of the song.\nThe characteristic \u201cwoos\u201d were\nfilled in by the audience which\nwas of particular interest to me \u2013 did they expect that\ngap to be filled? A risky, yet exciting decision. The set\nwas finished up by Gabe\u2019s emotive rendition of \u2018Rocketman\u2019 and finally the Quadronaut special served at\nthe end of the every performance: \u2018The Chain\u2019.\nTremolo take to the stage next, bubbling with en-ergy. Most of it coming from lead singer Ryo - I know\nhis name because he enjoyed asking the crowd \u201cwho\nare we?\u201d, to replies of \u201cTREMOLO\u201d and also \u201cwhat\u2019s\nmy name?\u201d, to replies of \u201cRYO\u201d, almost all of these\nshouts coming from one group behind me. The energy\nis what I loved about this band. \u201cYou know where you\nare? You\u2019re in the jungle, baby!\u201d Ryo screams as the\nband kick off their set with a double portion of Guns\nN\u2019 Roses. A lively \u2018Welcome To The Jungle\u2019 barrelled\ninto a fiery \u2018Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine\u2019 that looked particularly taxing as the lead guitarist wiped his forehead\nafter a high-octane solo. A mosh-pit started during\nthe band\u2019s rendition of \u2018Back In Black\u2019 and was swiftly\nbroken up by the security guard stood on the side of\nthe stage. During \u2018Beat It\u2019 by Michael Jackson, the\nenergy flowing off stage was finally accepted by the\naudience, when people started singing and dancing\nalong. Another scream from Ryo - \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 roll never\ndies!\u201d - led us into Tremolo\u2019s final performance of\n\u2018Livin\u2019 On A Prayer\u2019.\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nDon\u2019t miss the gig -Melon Band @ Metric,\n25th March, 18:30\nMelon Band invites you to their\nsecond performance of\nthe year - the Spring\nLive - sharing 13 songs\nfrom various anime, J-pop\nartists and bands!

The Council on\nForeign Relations state that\nalmost 21 million people are in need\nof humanitarian aid, with around 5\nmillion of these people reduced to just\nskin and bone as they struggle to find\nfood. An estimated 110,000 people\nhave died so far as a result of the war,\nand it is classified as \u2018worsening\u2019.\nThe fighting began in 2014, and\nremainstodayasaconflictbetweenthe\nYemeni government and a rebel group\nknown as the Houthis. The Houthis\nare backed by Iran, and the Yemeni\ngovernmentisbackedbySaudiArabian\nleader Mohammed bin Salman.\nHouthis control parts of northern\nYemen, whilst the government-Arab\nstate coalition occupies most other\nareas. Iran has deployed its navy to\nthe region to support the Houthis,\nand Saudi Arabia, among other\nArab states, have provided countless\nweapons to the government\u2019s forces\nand have set up a naval blockade\npreventing arms reaching Houthicontrolled areas of the country,\nwhich also prevents millions of\ndollars in aid from reaching civilians\nin affected regions of the country.\nThis is all backed by the West.\nThe UK still sells arms to Saudi\nArabia, which uses them directly to\narm forces that assault and rocket\ncivilian occupied areas. Only\nin February 2021 did Joe Biden\nannounce a withdrawal of support\nfor Saudi-led offensive operations.\nNot only do we let so many millions\nof people undergo unimaginable\nsuffering every day for almost a\ndecade, but we actually profit from it.\nFootage from war-torn areas shows\nchildren screaming, blind, bloodied,\nbones poking through their skin as\nnot a millimeter of flesh remains\ndue to the prolonged starvation.\nBandaged teenagers\ncry at video cameras in\npure terror, and no one\ncomes to help them.\nThis is not just the\nfault of the West\u2019s civilian\nmorality - if the media\ngave an ounce of attention\nto what is going on there then\nthings would be drastically different,\nbut they don\u2019t. Googling \u2018Yemen\nconflict\u2019 whilst doing background for\nthis piece, the first article that comes\nup was published five months ago.\nEven Yemen is at the thick end of\nthe media coverage wedge. Ethiopia\u2019s\ncivil war has been ongoing for well\nover a year now. Reports of what\nappear to be concentration camps for\nTigrayan people inch their way into\nthe middle pages of Private Eye and\nno where else. Videos have surfaced\nof the military burning civilians\nalive, and no one knows about it.\nRecently a prison in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nwas overtaken by inmates. Women\nand teenagers in the prison begged\nfleeing guards to help them escape,\nbut they said no. The vulnerable\nwere rounded up in the prison yard\nand raped and beaten for days on\nend until the prison was eventually\nreclaimed. No one knows about it.\nThis week Michael Gove announced\nthat unlimited people fleeing the\nUkraineconflictcouldsettleintheUK\nfor at least three years. This is brilliant\nnews, but this has been needed for\ndecades to help those who are not\nwhite and European. The open arms\napproach of the EU in this conflict,\nwhen compared to the response to\nthe 2015 migrant crisis of mostly\nSyrians, is nothing but shameful.\nRacism\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

This song\u2019s essence is about \u2018do I want\nto know if they\u2019re okay or do I just want to leave the\ndoor open?\u2019, \u2018was that relationship really as good as I\nremember it, or have I changed some of the details in\nmy mind to make the narrative more convenient?\u2019.\n\u2018Scott Street\u2019 - Phoebe Bridgers\nLike much of Stranger, \u2018Scott Street\u2019 tackles the\ntheme of loneliness. It perfectly encapsulates the\ndisconnect and isolation you feel when reconnecting\nwith someone you were once close to and realising how\nmuch they (or both of you) have changed. As you make\nsmall talk, you realise the shared interests that brought\nyou together as lovers no longer exist. The song ends\nwiththeline:\u201cAnyway,don\u2019tbeastranger.\u201dIt\u2019sBridgers\u2019\nway of saying, \u201cWe should catch up soon!\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s get\ncoffee sometime.\u201d It\u2019s more of a polite parting phrase\nthan a serious suggestion. You\u2019ll go your separate ways\nand never text each other or meet for that cup of coffee.\nYou\u2019ll eventually run into another old flame, and the\ncycle repeats.\n\u2018Stories\u2019 - Refs\nThe cluster of instrumentals in \u2018Stories\u2019 is a key\ncomponentthataddsintricacytothetrack;therecastof\ndrums, along with the atmospheric soundscapes, make\nit hard to distinguish if the song is meant to sound sad\nor happy - and one of the lyrics from the song, \u201cwe hold\non to different things / to different stories,\u201d is a message\nthat sticks.\n\u2018I Need My Girl\u2019 - The National\nA ballad in ode to\nlost love, \u2018I Need My\nGirl\u2019 is a grief-filled\nlonesome, strummed\nheartbreak jam about\nlosing someone. This\nsong opens with a\ndelicate lick that pulls\nthe listener in and uses\nit as a foundation for a\nsombre tune about desperation and devotion.\n\u2018sucks to see you doing better\u2019 - Valley\nA single about thinking you are watching an ex\ndo better than you\nfollowing a breakup,\nthe track explores the\nreality that neither\nparty is ever as okay as\nthey seem after a split,\ndespite their public\npersona. Even if one\nparty is doing better\nthan the other- nothing\nis ever as simple or easy as it comes across. With a fun\nand almost poppy backdrop, the song reminisces on\nthe relationship prior to its turn south in an emotional\nway that leaves listeners feeling unsure about their\nemotions. Should they be sad with the narrator? Or be\ndancing to the catchy beats?\n\u2018Who Knew\u2019 - P!nk\nSometimes we accidentally take for granted that\nthe best people we know will always be in our lives\nsomehow - not in the \u201cwe-are-going-to-be-togetherforever\u201d way, but in\nthe way that makes it\nimpossible to fathom\na person won\u2019t be part\nof your life. The story\npresented in this song\nis a romantic one, but\nthe lyrics are vague and\nuniversal to squelch the\nemptiness clawing holes\nin your heart. I might never quite understand why I\nlose the people I do while I\u2019m still standing, but music\nproves to be the comfort I always need, who knew.\n\u2018Happy Ending\u2019 - MIKA\nI love MIKA. I love him like I love a bowl of Half\nBakedafteralongday.IfhissongscameinapintofBen\n& Jerry\u2019s, I would eat\nthem. Seriously. MIKA\ndelivers a mesmerising\ndream sequence of a\nsong that carries the\nsinger above the Earth\nwhile he solemnly sings\nabout \u201cno hope, no love,\nno glory.\u201d\n\u2018Pablow The Blowfish\u2019 - Miley Cyrus\nA child-like ballad about a dead fish, Miley sings\nfrom a place of vulnerability and sets the tone for a very\ntrance-like psychedelic heartbreak song. At the end of\nthe bridge, you can hear her\njokingly mention \u201cmaybe\nyou\u2019ll fall in love with a seahorse named Sadie\u201d, but\nimmediately break down at\nthe idea that maybe Pablow\nis better off without her.\n\u2018Radio Silence\u2019 - Gretta\nRay\nGretta\u2019s voice fluctuates from low and deep to\nstretching highs whilst\nkeeping the soft tone\nshe is known for. Light\nguitar riffs followed by\nlow kick drums guide you\nthrough the song. \u2018Radio\nSilence\u2019 is a song of loss\nand regret laid out in the\nmost approachable and\nsoothing manner.\n\u2018Cut The String\u2019 - Jenny Yim\nIt\u2019s a song about cutting oneself from an unhealthy\nromance, and Jenny\u2019s soulful, earthy voice croons\nabout coming to terms\nwith the fact that love\nis not an everlasting\nperformance in which\nyou attempt to retain\nthe attention of your\nsignificant other.\n\u2018When\u2019 \u2013 Dodie\n\u2018When\u2019 is about\nbeing hopelessly in love with a memory. It comprises\ncinematic compositions with ripples of strings, piano\nand guitar, echoes of clarinet, all topped with a\nmellifluous voice that\nrecalls Regina Spektor\nwithout the bite.\nDodie is unafraid to\nbe messy and tender\nin candid lyrics that\nconsider relationships\nwith others and herself\n(\u201cAm I the only one\nwishing life away?\nNever caught up in the\nmoment, busy begging the past to stay\u201d).\n\u2018coney island\u2019 - Taylor Swift (feat. The National)\nWhen it\u2019s cold, \u2018coney island\u2019\u2019s broken-down\nrollercoasters and abandoned boardwalk take on an\nominous, almost post-apocalyptic feeling, which\nperhaps stems from the fact\nthat \u2018coney island\u2019\u2019s theme\nparks have burned countless\ntimes, and the place has\nalways been as connected to\nhedonism and waste as it is\nto joy. The simplicity of the\nproduction only enhances\nit. It\u2019s everything I could\u2019ve\nhoped for in a song titled\n\u2018coney island\u2019 and featuring\nThe National.

How nice of that person I\nwas in halls with to message me to ask how\nI am. Yes, it has been a long time, thank\nyou for asking. No, I will not vote for you.\nWe here at NegaFelix have leapt to your\naid by providing you with the best ways\nto avoid having to promise to vote for\nsomeone.\n1. Act enthusiastic and ask to see their\nmanifesto. When they send it to you\nhave a sudden change of heart and\ntell you have serious concerns about\nboth their credibility and fitness for\noffice. Bonus: send them extracts\nfrom their opponents\u2019 manifestos as\nsuggestions\n2. Pretend you can only make fish\nnoises. NegaFelix research has found\nthat herring and lionfish are the most\neffective fish noises, with flounder\nand sprat the least, as they can\nsometimes be understood\n3. Ask them whether they have\nsufficiently aristocratic blood to\nconsider taking on a position like\nthat.\n4. Tell them you will give them your\nvote if they provide you with six\nonions\n5. Tell them you are actually running\nagainst them and that their actions\namount to electoral intimidation. If\nbold you can then report them to the\nUnion for wrong-think.\n6. Pretend your grandmother just died\nand it was her dream to become RCSU\nVice-Deputy Activities secretary\n(replace as needed) and that it is\nincredibly insensitive of them to send\nyou a message at this time. Bonus,\ncombine with 5 to produce maximum\nbad blood.\n7. Thank them for their message and\nlet them know you have kompromat\non their opponent but can only share\nit in person. Ask to meet in a public\nlocation and get them to buy you\ndinner, wine and flowers. When they\nask for the information, just put your\nfinger on your lips and wink. When\nthe meal is over, lean in for a kiss.\n(For the people who haven\u2019t been on a\ndate in a while)\n8. Buy enough badges and posters for\nthat candidate to breach spending\nlimits. Campaign on their behalf\nand rally all your friends and their\nfriends to vote for that person. When\nthey win (due to your amazing\ncampaigning) leak the receipts for\nyour purchases to the Union\n9. Challenge them to a game of Facebook\nMessenger basketball, best of 79.\n10.Actually get involved in the election\nprocess, learn who the candidates\nare, find out what they stand for,\ntheir experience and their merits.\nWatch the hustings to get a clearer\npicture of their values. Interview past\nholders of the role to get a clear idea\nof what it would entail. Forget to vote\nin the election, making all your work\npointless.\n\n"

    "content": "For the second time in our lives Russia has invaded Ukraine. This was\nto the surprise of only the na\u00efve and\nthe oblivious. As Joe Biden quipped\non January 20th, with two-thirds of the\nRussian military machine surrounding\nUkrainian territory from the North\n(Belarus), East, and South (Crimea),\nVladimir Vladimirovich Putin \u201cHas to\ndo something\u201d. His long list of untenable demands from Ukraine and NATO\nalong with his uncompromising style of\ndiplomacy in negotiating these demands\ncould not be understood as anything but\na pretext for war.\nOn February 9th, before the wailing\nof the sirens but after the Russian Tsar\u2019s\nintentions were plainly shared for all to\nsee, historian and anthropologist Yuval\nNoah Hariri wrote in an opinion piece\nfor The Economist that \u201cUnlike gravity,\nwar isn\u2019t a fundamental force of nature\u201d\nand that the decline of war in the last\nseventy years has been the result of \u201cHumans making better choices.\u201d Unsurprisingly for anyone who has read his book\n\u2018Sapiens\u2019, Hariri believes that humanity\ncan maintain its impressive streak of relative peace by continuing to make these\n\u201cgood choices\u201d. Perhaps this state of relative peace could continue if the countries of the world agreed to abide by a\nset of international rules which bound\nthem all with clear punishments and\nconsequences for violators. Indeed, this\nhas been the state of affairs since at least\nthe closing of the Cold War, with institutions such as the United Nations and\nthe World Trade Organisation acting as\njudicial bodies in disputes concerning\ninternational law. But some actors have\nnow dubbed this international rules-based order \u2018Western hegemony\u2019 and\nhave set themselves upon its destruction.\nI do not claim to know whether the\nhuman condition will remain forever\nas it is today. Perhaps in some distant\nfuture all our kind will live together\npeacefully as part of some global body\npolitic. Whether or not such a future is\nfeasible cannot be known at this time.\nBut what can be known is that if this\nfuture does exist, then it is distant. So\ndistant in fact that it has no bearing on\nthe reality of our lives today. As Hariri\nadmits \u201cTo enjoy peace, we need almost\neveryone to make good choices. By con-trast, a poor choice by just one side can\nlead to war.\u201d But herein lies the ruin of\nhis hopes for a peaceful world since, as\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli observed five-hun-dred years ago, \u201cThe way men live is so\nfar removed from the way they ought to\nlive that anyone who abandons what is\nfor what should be pursues his downfall\nrather than his preservation; for a man\nwho strives after goodness in all his acts\nis sure to come to ruin, since there are so\nmany men who are not good.\u201d That is to\nsay, that the appearance of challengers to\nthis peaceful and prosperous global order was inevitable, and the only way to\npreserve or restore it is by way of force.\nUnfortunately, as the situation in\nUkraine illustrates, the Western world\nis prohibitively limited in its recourse to\nforce, due primarily to the threat of nuclear escalation. Nuclear weapons make\nuse of the nuclear option impossible.\nTo enable institutions such as NATO\nto preserve the global rules-based order,\nthey must have the option of waging war\non those powers which are large enough\nto challenge this hegemony. Since such\nentities will almost always be nuclear\npowers, a rules-based world order will\nnot be possible for as long as the threat\nof nuclear strikes remains a realistic\nmeans of retribution in case of war. In\nother words, countermeasures must be\ndeveloped to render intercontinental\nballistic missiles and other methods of\nnuclear warhead delivery obsolete, and\nthis is the one and only path towards\nlasting peace across the globe. This is\nso, not because such countermeasures\nwould make the prospect of war somehow less terrible but because they would\nmake war possible again.\nThe weapon of choice for the West\nagainst aggressive states has been economic sanctions. These have been effective in a number of cases, as in when they\nbrought Iran to the negotiating table\nover its nuclear program, leading to the\nJoint Plan of Action in 2013 and later to\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n(JCPOA) in 2015 signed by Iran and\nthe permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. In 2018\nDonald Trump unilaterally pulled the\nUnited States out of the JCPOA, reimposing severe sanctions on Iran. This was\nan unforced blunder; not the only one\nPresident Trump made in office. However, what has unfolded since serves as\nan important case study of the limits of\neconomic warfare.\nIran\u2019s economy was in poor shape\neven before the renewed sanctions of\n2018. Annual inflation stood at ten\npercent and the first few weeks of the\nyear were marked by protests linked to\npoor economic conditions, including\na sharp rise in the price of eggs (I am\nnot joking). Once the sanctions hit,\ninflation quickly spiked to 40%, eventually peaking at 50%. Hyperinflation\nwas predicted, of the kind that crippled\nNicolas Maduro\u2019s regime in Venezuela.\nBut this did not come to pass. The economy has since stabilized. Inflation has\nbeen on a downward trend since the beginning of 2021. It now hovers around\n35%. This would still be unacceptable\nfor a developed economy, but the people of Iran are not used to the stability\nand security that we take for granted\n(nor for that matter, are the Russian\npeople). Iran\u2019s economy withstood the\ninitial shock in 2018. So did its leaders.\nThe sanctions have failed on two fronts.\nThey have failed to weaken the political\nelite\u2019s support of Iran\u2019s supreme leader,\nAli Khamenei. They have also failed in\ninspiring meaningful popular opposition towards the regime. Khamenei has\ninstalled Hussein Rouhani, a loyalist, as\nPresident. The parliament is also full of\nhardliners and sycophants. Not only has\nKhamenei\u2019s position not been compromised since 2018, regionally he is more\npowerful today than he ever has been.\nHaving decisively won its Cold War\nagainst Saudi Arabia (again, despite the\nsanctions), Iran backs several militant\ngroups throughout the Middle East, including the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Worse, Iran is closer\nthan it has ever been to developing an\natomic weapon.\nThe situation in Russia will likely develop in much the same way. Putin will\nretain the loyalty of those he needs to\nstay in power. Popular dissent will only\ntrouble him for a time before people\ncome to terms with this war. Why will\nthe people come to terms with the war?\nAnd why will they not continue in their\nactivism and resort to civil disobedience\nas has happened in the past in that same\ncountry? This is a critical question, but\none that we cannot tackle here. I ask the\nreader to be content for the moment\nwith the justification provided by the\nanalogy with Iran.\nOnce the shock of the initial affair has\nworn off, Vladimir Vladimirovich will\nNo Nuclear option\nPeace will last for as long as it can be defended\nCommentWriter\nFaridKaveh\nFRIDAY 18TH MARCH 2022\n27\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment\nPhoto credits: Clarkson Frederick Stanfield from Wikimedia Commons\nThe Battle of Trafalgar - William Clarkson Stanfield\nScience, Morality, CRISPR\nBy Wang Guo\nWas Machiavelli wrong?

Fuelled on by the arrival\nof our new, not so baby-faced coach,\nIC Swim Water Polo had a tremendous\nBUCS season this year. Unfortunately, a\ncatastrophic event that shook the world\nto its core more than a global pandemic befell our LUSL 1s in their match\nagainst the Medics 1s. Due to several\nnotable absences and suspiciously old\nlooking medics faces, the LUSL 1s suffered a historic defeat to the medics 1s.\nThis defeat will never be forgotten and\nis the fire in our bellies that motivates us\nto obliterate them\nat varsity. The 2s,\nfull of new faces,\nhave had a fantastic\nseason. Most nota-bly, they had two\ngreat performances in narrow losses\nto the IC 1s and\nICSM 1s. This puts\ntheminagreatposi-tion to dominate in their match against\nICSM 2s.\nLearning from the history of this\ntense fixture, our captains Angelo (the\none that lost to the medics for the first\ntime in a hundred years) and Ozan, are\nmentally preparing our players for any\ndesperate tricks the medics may pull out\nasalastresort.Varsity,unlikethemedics,\nnever disappoints, so come on down to\nthe pool to watch two great matches and\njoin in the fun at the union afterwards\nwhere the medics may finally perform\nwell. A word of warning, we recommend\ngoing to the toilets well before varsity to\navoid the queue of petrified medics.\nWaterpolo ICSM\nYour reigning champs are back and\nthey\u2019re here to two-peat Varsity.\nICSM Water Polo have reached their\npinnacle of performance, currently sitting higher in the LUSL table than both\nIC teams. Having gone toe to toe with\nsome of Europe\u2019s best water polo teams,\nIC stawnd no chance at winning - they\u2019d\nbe lucky to score. Having already played\nand won against IC on multiple occa-sions, we know what to expect. Us medics have also started\ntraining since September, a whole\nmonth earlier than\nthe non-medics\nteam. This just\ngoes to show we are\nmore dedicated,\nfaster, and slicker\nin the pool.\nWe\u2019ve had a lot\nof success outside the pool as well, accumulating over 100 members. We have\norganised additional matches, namely\nthe alumni match and United Hospital\nTournament,furtherprovidingeveryone\nwith an equal opportunity to partake in\nthe sport no matter the playing ability.\nWho\u2019s going to win Varsity 21/22? Most\nlikely us, but come and support us anyway to watch one of the most anticipated matches of the year.\nMen\u2019s Football IC\nThe IC Men\u2019s Football Team enjoyed\nwelcoming some superb freshers to our\nranks this year, and they\u2019ve been a crucial part of The Club\u2019s resurgence after\nweathering the height of the pandemic.\nAs we broke record numbers in terms\nof members, we also experienced great\nsuccesses across all of our teams. The 4s\nwent on a great\ncup run, the 7s\ncontinued to beat\nthe 6s, and the\nFutsal teams both\nwent unbeaten\nbefore the Christmasbreak.The1st\nXI took notes and\nrapidly started\nimproving their\nown game, leaving\nthem at the top of the LUSL table by\nChristmas as well. The last time football headlined varsity was back in 2019.\nIt was a brilliant game in which ICSM\nFC took an early lead but ICU FC came\nback to win 3-2 with a late free kick. In\n2020 the Medics claimed back the Varsity trophy with a 4-2 Victory, setting up\nthis encounter perfectly for a top quality\ngame! Previous results show this fixture\nalways delivers plenty of goals and with\ntheteamsascloselymatchedinBUCSas\nthey ever have been in recent years, this\nyear\u2019s game promises to be an eye-catch-ing one for the fans.\nICSM FC Club Captain\nICSM FC has had a record breaking\nseason recruiting more members than\never before. Much of this is down to a\nbrilliant intake of freshers who we have\nwelcomed into all 4 of our squads.\nOur excellent recruitment has led to\nthe establishment of our new 5-a-side\nteam marshalled by Magician Mo\nMemon, which currently sits top of the\nImperial intra-mural league. Our new\nlook 4th team are looking to finish in\nthe top 4 in LUSL under the tutelage\nof captain Joao\nFelix; meanwhile\nour 3s sit top of\ntheir league with\ncaptain Harsha\nproviding 9 goals\nand 6 assists at the\ntime of writing.\nSam \u201cthe big\ncheese\u201d Chuter looks to have\nsteered the 2s away\nfrom relegation in BUCS and into the\nprestigious United Hospitals Cup Final.\nEthan Losty\u2019s return to goalscoring form\nin recent weeks has helped the 1st team\nin their BUCS promotion push and another strong LUSL finish.\nAfter winning 3 of the 4 matches at\nVarsity 2020, ICSM FC are confident\ngoing into this year\u2019s battle.\nThe headline fixture promises to be\na high scoring game following a historic 4-2 victory for ICSM last time out.\nWe are looking forward to 4 enthralling\nmatches, and hopefully bringing the varsity trophies back to the Reynolds Bar.\nFRIDAY 18TH MARCH 2022\n311\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT\nVarsity Captains Set to Thrash Each Other\nLia Trimarchi IC Waterpolo\nNicholas Soon ICSM Waterpolo\nDylan Hughes IC Football\nAdam Moorcroft ICSM Football\nICSM Waterpolo at Varsity 2020\nIC Waterpolo at Varsity 2020\nICSM VS IC Football Varsity 2020\n\n"

Rewilding is, in essence, a system of minimal\nintervention that aims to allow parts of the world to\nreturn to their pre-anthropocene states, allowing food\nwebs to build and change themselves as opposed to the\nintensive management championed by some conservationists in recent decades. George Monbiot has positioned himself at the head of this movement that calls\nfor changes that almost everyone would agree with\nalongsidesomesoobscureyoumaythinkthey\u2019reajoke.\nThebookprovidesanenjoyablejourneyboththrough\ndifferent biomes as well as different parts of Monbiot\u2019s\nlife. Near the beginning we hear of his time living with\ntribesmen in South America, where an illegal mining\ncommunitythreatenstoendtheirwayoflife;soonafter\nwe hear of his time living with the Maasai in Kenya,\nwhere a 30-mile barefoot run to a relative\u2019s house is all\nin a day\u2019s work. You are taken through the coasts, the\ncountryside, the savannah and the oceans, seeing how\ndifferent things used to be and how so many well-intentioned conservationists today\nget it so wrong.\nGeorge misses this\nferal life, and seeks\nto reclaim it at least\nsomewhat by moving to\na rural abode in Wales.\nReading Feral in 2022\noffers an interesting\ninsight into how the world\nhaschangedinthenineyears\nsince it was written. Peppered\nwith references and allusions\nto EU environmental policy\nwhich used to bind us, but\nwhich we are now\nwriggling free\nof, it focuses\nheavily on\nM o n b i o t \u2019s\nh o m e l a n d\nof Wales.\nThe country\nbarely makes\nit out of the\nring alive;\nMonbiot is\nd i s d a i n f u l\nof the state\nof Glaslyn,\nwhat the\nMontgomeryshire Wildlife Trust\ndescribe as \u2018the wildest and most\nregionally important site\u2019 that they\nmanage. He also frequently refers to\nsheepas\u201cthewhiteplague\u201d,blamingthem\nfor causing more damage to the Welsh\nenvironment than all building that has\never taken place, describing the current\nstate of the land as \u201csheepwrecked\u201d.\nThe book tells a story at the same\ntime as providing volley after volley of\nfacts relating to the decline of the wild\nand how things used to be. When what\nis now Trafalgar Square was excavated,\nto provide the foundations of what\nstands there today, builders found the\nbones of elephants, hippopotami and\nlions. Elephants are suspected to have\ndominated the British landscape until\nas recently as 113,000 years ago, with\nsomeoftheremainsfoundinexcavations\ndated to as little as 11,000 years old.\nThere were lions on Great Britain, a\nfact I think too few people realise.\nMoreover, the presence of elephants\ndid not just mean another dominant\nherbivore at the time, but it seems to\nhave altered the way British vegetation\nhas evolved. Trees such as limes, which\nwe often coppice today (cut the branches\noff to encourage new growth), fare\nremarkably well after losing enough mass\nto kill many other species. Likewise,\nmany can withstand the loss of a\nsubstantial amount of bark that would\nlead others to perish. Many British trees appear to\nhave evolved to withstand the destructive behaviour\nof elephants, in a land where trees that\nwere too small or fragile would simply\nhave been wiped out by the herds.\nThe most impactful chapter in\nthewholebookwasoneofthefinal\ninstalments, titled \u2018rewilding the\nsea\u2019. The decline of the world\u2019s\noceansoverthecenturiesistruly\nheartbreaking to comprehend;\nnets, trawlers and rockhopper\nfishing equipment leave every\ninch of the oceans fishable,\nand populations of almost\nall species have plummeted\nas a result. The amount\nof catch that is unwanted\nand simply thrown back\ninto the sea is staggering.\nHerring in the 20th century\nwas so abundant that\nfishermen ground up excess and used it as pig feed or\nfor fertilizing lawns; when settlers first landed in the\nAmericas they could pluck 10kg lobsters from the\nrockpools with such ease that they too ended up as\npig feed; reports from those arriving in the Americas\ndescribe men in canoes being hardly able to paddle\nfor all the giant salmon and sturgeon in the rivers\nthere. What we\u2019re left with now is dwarf colonies\nclinging on for life, at fractions of a percent of their\npopulation size before humans began exploiting them.\nThere are some odd moments too; a bit too\nmuch time is given to quashing the myth of the\nPembrokeshire Panther, only to bring it back to an\nobscure theory of our brains craving the wild world we\nused to live in. His activism certainly shines through\non a number of occasions, where motivated reasoning\nclearly leads him to a conclusion different from\nwhere the reader might have arrived by themselves.\nThe few books I\u2019ve read on rewilding before this\none made no dent in the impact and entertainment\nit delivered. If you\u2019re at all interested in conservation\nand environmentalism, this is a must read.\nCredit: JK the Unwise, Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

That\nsuch fiction increasingly appears to be approximating\nthe timeline we find ourselves in right now is, of course,\ndeeply unsettling. And therefore, the whole stage was\noozing with sombre perspectives and disturbingly reminiscent of canaries in coal mines.\nBeyond these vague motifs, it is hard to pin down a\nprecise plot. An eclectic choice of dance, music pieces\nvarying between folk and electronic, and at least two\nstory lines ensured that the audience never knew what\nto expect. Always going back and forth between the\ncomprehensible and the indigestible, at some point\nI gave up and realised that I found myself more in an\nabsurdist play more than something trying to convey a\nconcise political statement.\nLet me try to unravel a bit:\nEverything is set in the year\n2049 and the first act concerns\na small village in the aforementioned \u201cRussian Reich\u201d. Corruption and blind deference plagues\nmost of the village, and is most\ncertainly a reflection of the experiences of many in the last century. Here, the majority of our company come together, there is a lot of\nnon-dialogue, and some very wild scenes. In contrast,\nthe final acts are a much more coherent Noir-style\ntragedy, following a detective through a fantastical trip\nthrough Berlin, Hamburg, Paris, Prague, and Vilnius.\nOne would hope that the antagonist of the \u201cRussian\nReich\u201d, the \u201cLeague of European Nations\u201d (successor of\nthe European Union), would offer a more glamorous\noutlook. But, alas, it too has deteriorated into a blob of\nindifference. And, while our detective is trying to solve\na murder; really, we are mourning the death of poetry\nand literature in the ostensibly free, but amorphous,\nEurope.\nAs someone who is somewhat familiar with German\nculture, I enjoyed the references made to it, especially\nDogs of Europe \u2014 A nightmare coming true\nTheatre\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 11\nEdited by:\nAlexander Cohen\nAlex jackson\nBoxhuan Zhang\nArts Rigoletto review\nPower lies and corruption return\nto the Royal Opera House\nBy Alexander Cohen\n13\npage\nCredits: Photo/ Jennifer Reynolds\n\u201cWherever they burn books, in the end will also burn human beings.\u201d\nDogs of Europe\nReviewed by Louis Jabouri Arts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Could a new method for modelling\nconcrete lead the way in sustainable\ndesign? MIT and IBM are collaborating\nto create AI-modelled geopolymer cement formulations made with recycled\nindustrial by-products, reducing the carbon emissions associated with the manufacture of traditional cement.\nThe problem with concrete\nWhat comes to mind when you think\nof the building materials of the future?\nTowering glass skyscrapers, walls covered in flora and fauna?\nWhat about concrete? Low-cost, and\nwith high mechanical strength and du-rability, the material has become ubiq-uitous. Made from particles called aggregates glued together with a binder,\nconcrete has been a reliable building\nmaterial for centuries, taking us from\nthe Roman Pantheon to the buildings\nand bridges of the modern city. But concrete has its flaws. Releasing 2.8 billion\ntonnes of CO2\nannually, if concrete were\na country, it would be the third highest\nemitter after China and the US.\nPortland cement is the most common\nbinder, a mix of limestone and clay. It\nis the production of clinker, the main\nconstituent of cement, that emits that\nlargest amount of CO2\nin concrete pro-duction. Cement is also responsible for\nnearly 10% of global industrial water\nuse, and in 2050, 75% of the water demand for concrete production will likely\noccur in regions that are expected to experience water stress. Aggregates include\nsand and gravel extracted from quarries,\npits,andsubmergeddeposits.Quarrying\ndestroys precious agricultural land and\nwildlife habitats. Over 45 billion tonnes\nof sand are mined each year, eroding riverbeds and beaches. In Indonesia, sand\nmining has destroyed several islands,\nand globally the scramble for \u2018usable\u2019\nsand has led to a dangerous black-mar-ket trade.\nMaking concrete from waste\nAs growing economies inevitably become more urbanised, demand for concrete is set to increase. At the same time,\nthe amount of waste produced is set to\nincrease as lifestyles change accordingly.\nOne solution is geopolymer concrete, a\nconcrete that uses industrial waste products as a concrete binder. Aggregate particles can also be made from recycled\nmaterials - 28% of UK concrete aggregates are currently derived from recycled\nsources. The difficulty is in testing the\nproperties of concrete produced from\nvarious combinations of available waste\nproducts. Researchers at MIT are using\nAI to model the performance of concrete formulations. The work follows a\ngrowing trend in materials development,\nwhere time-consuming laboratory work\nis being replaced with new advanced al-gorithms. Whereas previously samples\nhad to be made and tested individually,\nnow properties such as strength, durability and fracture toughness can be accurately predicted with just the material\ncomposition as an input. Microstructure\nproperties and performances can be accurately predicted using data directly extracted from scientific literature.\nThis use of natural language processing\nmeans that the database the algorithm\ncan draw upon increases in real time as\nfurther research is carried out.\nModelling with machine\nlearning\nThe research is a collaboration between\nthe Department of Materials Science\nand Engineering at MIT, and the IBM\nWatson AI Lab. The materials side of\nthe research involves understanding\nglass and mineral reactivities, processing\ntechniques and the development of defects in material samples. Machine learning (where tasks are repeated until data\nis sorted into hierarchies) is combined\nwith multi-objective optimisation to\nnot only sift through crystal structures\nbut to extrapolate concrete behaviour as\ntime passes.\nIn this case, a semi-supervised algorithm (where a small amount of labelled\ndata is combined with a larger amount\nof unlabelled data during training) was\nused. It considered not only mechanical and chemical performance criteria,\nbut also cost and environmental impact.\nThe researchers used a different form of\nAI (natural language processing) to read\nthrough and extract materials test data\nfrom research papers.\nBy limiting possible reactants to regional waste supply, rather than virgin\nmaterial, a circular industrial materials\neconomy could be introduced. Reliance\non imports could be minimised and\nCO2\nemissions reduced. And then just\nmaybe, concrete can become a little bit\ngreener.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nEmily Donald Science Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nEngineering the modern concrete jungle\nMachine learning is all about training models from data. It is how the\nresearchers used specific concrete performance to predict the properties of\nnew formulations. Let\u2019s say we have photos of wombats and butterflies. In\none type of machine learning, we ask a human expert to label each photo\nW or B, and then feed this labelled data to our algorithm. The algorithm\nthen \u2018learns\u2019 from this training data how to label previously unseen data\n(i.e., correctly identify a new butterfly photo). This is called supervised\nlearning (think of the supervision being from the human expert who\ncan label perfectly). Since we have discrete data, this algorithm would\nalso be a classification algorithm (we\u2019re classifying data into two separate\ncategories). In unsupervised learning algorithms, there are no labels.\nEXPLAINER\nMACHINE LEARNING\nCement mixer\nPhoto credit: Ddenbenn, Wikimedia Commons, CC-BA-SA-2.0\n\n"

But on\na practical level this wasn\u2019t enough, my\nlife was still too cluttered. For example,\nI decided to cancel my subscriptions to\nNetflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, and only\nkeep HBO max and Crunchyroll. However,\nmost people would expect these kinds of\nsacrifices from a typical Buddhist. What\nthey may not expect is that a fervent\nmonk like myself can still snort ketamine\nfrequently without losing their clear mind.\nKetamine is somewhat of a passion\nof mine, and I knew if Buddha were\nalive today he would have tried it. He\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to\nrelinquish something so integral to my\nidentity; Buddhism of course is about\nbeing yourself. But despite this likely\nreceptiveness on the Buddha\u2019s part, I\nknew I couldn\u2019t keep doing it the same way\nI always had.\nAll my changes were in the mentality of\na typical monk. I stopped using a rolled\nup \u00a35 note to channel the substance into\nmy nose, because monks aren\u2019t supposed\nto handle currency. Instead of doing it\non a toilet seat while I kneel on the floor,\nI acquired a simple wooden table and\nalways used a full lotus position. And now\nI make sure to do it in front of my precious\nBuddha statue.\nI have received backlash from other\nBuddhists. They say things like \u201cYou\naren\u2019t even complying with the most\nbasic of maxims in the Dhammapada\u201d, or\n\u201cKetamine is not even one of the healthy\ndrugs\u201d, or \u201cNo, Buddha is not Jesus for\nHindus, that\u2019s wrong on both factual and\nreligious levels\u201d. But honestly? I think\nthey\u2019re just jealous of my heightened\nunderstanding. We\u2019re all trying to reach\nthe void, I just found it in a K-hole\n\n"

He has spent some time\ndecoupling Russia\u2019s economy from the\nWest, and he has had some success. The\nRussian treasury holds $600 billion in\nforeign reserves. Although Russia has no\nsuitable alternative to the SWIFT inter-bank payment system, it has successful\nalternatives to Western retail payment\nsystems. History is also on Putin\u2019s side.\nThe economic crisis of 1998, when the\nRussian Federation defaulted on its\ndebt, was arguably an even more difficult moment financially, but the country\nendured. Moreover, having borne the\nbrunt of Western sanctions, he will have\na much easier time justifying further\n\u201cSpecial military operations\u201d since his\ncountry will have much less to lose. This\nwill be especially true if the operation in\nUkraine is a success. No one will want\nto invest in Russia for a very long time.\nBut if that was the price to pay for unrestrained use of his military machine,\nthen Putin will probably not regret his\npurchase. Indeed, if his ambition is to\nrebuild the USSR, then this was a purchase he had to make.\nSo,whatarewe,theWest,todo?Surely, we cannot allow Putin or anyone else\nto break down the peaceful order that is\nthe crowning jewel of human achievement in the twentieth century. But economic warfare is not enough. There are\nthose who cannot be dissuaded from the\ndismantling of this order unless through\nforce. But we cannot bring force to bear\nupon them as long as the threat of nuclear retaliation persists. Global peace\ncan only be maintained if it can be defended by force, but use of force is not\npermitted if the adversary is armed with\nnukes. This makes clear the necessity of\nphysical or diplomatic countermeasures\nto nuclear weapons. Physical countermeasures include missile shields, diplomatic countermeasures include nuclear\ndisarmament. Any successful approach\nwill probably include a mixture of these\ntwo approaches. These safeguards must\nbe effective enough to bring the expected damage from a possible nuclear war\nto within acceptable bounds. Of course,\nwhat is acceptable must first be clarified.\nBut as the Ukrainian people know far\ntoo well, wars are not won by righteous-ness, but by sacrifice.\nJoseph Mengele, also known as the\n\u2018Angel of Death\u2019 was a Nazi physician\nwho practised inhumane experiments\nwith the prisoners of the Nazi concentration camps. He was particularly interested in twins; sewing them together,\nconnecting their blood vessels and organs to see the results. Unsurprisingly\nthe unfortunate victims would die hours\nafter these operations. Mengele always\nclaimed to perform these experiments in\nthe name of \u2018scientific progress\u2019. Yet it is\nundoubtable that Mengele\u2019s research did\nnot yield any significant contribution to\nscience, he simply caused suffering and\ntragic deaths. However, Mengele\u2019s actions force us to ask ourselves a simple\nquestion:towhichextentcanweconsid-er breaking morality and harming others\nin the name of science?\nCRISPR is a genetic engineering tool\ndeveloped from the bacterial immune\nsystem. It has completely revolutionised our view of life. Now, we are not\njust mere observers of DNA, but we\ncan manipulate it with ease and speed\nnever seen before. This has created the\nimpression that there are no limits to\nwhat CRISPR could achieve, from curing cancer to genetically modified ba-bies. The latter turned into reality when\na Chinese scientist called He Jiankui\nmodified the genome of two babies \u2013\nan action, he defended, to increase their\nresistance towards HIV as their father\nwas HIV-positive. He Jiankui wanted\nto make a change in the world, to be a\nhero and, contrary to Mengele, he did\nnot want to make the babies suffer, in\nfact the children are currently protected\nby anonymity. Despite his intentions,\nthe reactions of the scientific community were of shock and rejection, with\nHe Jiankui being labelled as \u2018greedy\u2019\nand \u2018cold-blooded\u2019. The Chinese government sentenced He Jiankui to a few\nyears in prison but most importantly, he\nwas strictly prohibited to step into any\nlab for the rest of his life. So, what are\nthe limits of scientific ambition when it\ncomestoachievingagreatergood?Espe-cially when such actions may harm some\n(or many) people on the way?\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli wrote one of the\nmost influential books of human history\nin 16th century Italy, The Prince. Aside\nfrom his writings on political affairs, a\nkey argument of this book is that actions\nwill be excused regardless of how immoral they are, provided that the results\nare positive enough to compensate for\nthe actions. He Jiankui did something\nterribly wrong, he altered the DNA of\nbabies without the permission of the scientific community. However, his results\nwere not impactful because\n(1) the mother was HIV negative, so\nthe babies surely would not have inherited the disease with simple measures like\nregular HIV testing, and\n(2) most importantly, he did not provide a definitive cure for HIV.\nIn my opinion, if he actually accomplished that, he would probably be\nexempted him from prison or at least\ngarnered him the support of the global\npopulation. The possible harm to the\nquality of life of the two babies would\nbe considered as \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in\nexchange for saving millions of lives\naround the world. When we experiment with rabbits and rats to develop\nour drugs, these animals are suffering,\nbut we just justify ourselves that their\ndeaths are necessary for the wellbeing\nof humans, probably the same argument would be applied to the babies\nwith many nuances though. If a scientist\nmanaged to find the cure of cancer but\nthree people died unexpectedy on the\nway without their approval, he probably\nwould be condemned to prison. However, the ten million people that would\ndie from cancer every year and their\nfamilies would probably be grateful for\nsuch a cure. These people would likely\nthink that killing people is not right, but\nthe killed people would not cause any\ndeep psychological trauma because they\nwould not know these victims. There is\nno emotional connection, just numbers\nofpeoplekilledtogetthecure.Unavoid-ably, despite the condemnation of the\nscientist, he will be remembered forever\nas the one who cured the worst diseases\nin humans.\nThe view of Machiavelli towards human nature is a simplistic one; charac-terising man as a selfish and cold being,\nwhichisnottrueatall.Somepeoplegive\ntheir lives for others without any hesita-tion, sacrificing the most valuable thing\nthey have: their own lives. I, personal-ly, have met people who have done me\na huge favour without asking anything\nfrom me in exchange. I remember fondly the director of my high school, who\nwrote the recommendation letter for my\nUCAS application even though she did\nnot know English. I am here partly because of her.\nAnother idea I want to touch on is the\nnotion that \u201cmy freedom ends when it\nstarts disturbing your freedom\u201d. This can\nbe applied to scientific research. Every\ninvestigation should take into account\nthe potential harm to people because\nthese are the ones who are funding the\nscientific research, these are the ones\nwho will be affected by the outcomes\nof the research. Scientists should not be\ncynical while conducting their research,\nthey should be aware of the ethical implications and act in consequence. We,\nas leaders and scientists of the future,\nmust take into account the general pop-ulation. We must have strong ethics and\navoid being corrupted by insane ambition and coldness. Otherwise, we will\nsee the next He Jiankui or worse, the\nnext Angel of Death.\nScience cannot\njustify immoral acts\nThe means never justify the final objectives because then we lose something even more important\non the way, our own humanity.\nCommentWriter\nWangGuo\n\n"

Zaghari-Ratcliffe\nwas detained by the Iranian government in 2016 when visiting a relative with her\ndaughter, who at the time was still not yet two years old. She was held on charges\nof plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, charges almost universally\nseen as trumped up, and sentenced to five years in jail. Her detention and a \u00a3400\nmillion debt owed to Iran by the British government from 1979 have widely\nbeen seen as linked for the duration of her detention. This week the government\npaid this debt, and Zaghari-Ratcliffe was released along with Anoosheh Ashoori,\na civil engineer detained four years ago on similar charges. Richard Ratcliffe said\nthe first thing Nazanin wanted was for him to make her a cup of tea.\nEight journalists killed in Mexico in 2022\nThe murder of Armando Linares L\u00f3pez marks the eight killing of a journalist\nin Mexico in 2022.

Seeking a\ntranscendentexperience(andagoodtime)intheclubs,\nI was meeting interesting characters in all aspects of the\ncity\u2019s nightlife. It was a magical time, or so it seemed.\nWhat led you to using\nthe concept of psychedelics as a cure for mental illnesses, and how\ndid you come to connect\nit to the allegory of \u2018a\ncure for a fragmented,\nmodern world\u2019?\nI\u2019m not trying to say that\npsychedelics are a definitive\ncure for anything. They can be\ndangerous, especially to people with mental illnesses. That\nbeing said, it was Dr. Robin\nCarhart-Harris at Imperial\nCollege who first reported\nseeing a reduction in activity\nof the default mode network\n[the part of the brain activated\nwhen you lose focus on your surroundings] when under the influence of psychedelics, by doing fMRI scans\non volunteers. This ego-dissolution can be akin to a\nfull-blown spiritual experience, especially when such\ndrugs are taken in conducive conditions. New neural\npathways are formed in the process, and it allows you\nto view yourself from a different perspective, which can\npotentially be utilised to break destructive patterns of\nbehaviour.\nIt\u2019s true that \u2018psychedelics\u2019 in this book are also being used as an allegory for anything that helps individuals reach beyond their own\nego and come away with a more\ncomplete view of life, death, and\neverything in-between.\nCould the novel also be\nconsidered a commentary\non the hierarchies and\nclass divisions of society?\nWe live in a highly stratified\nsociety, whether we realize it or\nnot. That\u2019s fine\u2026until it isn\u2019t.\nWhen a large enough segment\nof society feels disaffected, that\u2019s\nwhat leads to disruptions and\nconflict, and that state of being on the brink of chaos is the\nbackdrop for this book. The city\nof \u2018Terminus\u2019 is also an allegory\nfor an individual\u2019s desire to exert\npower over others, and the conflict that mindset creates, within\nand without.\nIs the city \u2018Terminus\u2019 based on anywhere in\nparticular?\nThe city of Terminus is based on a metropolitan area\nwhere I once worked (and often indulged \u2013 recreationally \u2013 in mind-expanding substances). There are some\nspecific locations and landmarks in the novel that are\nunique to that city.\nWill Terminus have a sequel; will it be the\nfirst in a longer series of books?\nYes, I\u2019m working on a story that takes place in a different city with a new super-villain. A few of the characters from this story will come along for that ride too.\nIf you could choose any one drug, which\nwould it be and why? What about a particular city \u2013 do you have a favourite city to\nvisit?\nI\u2019ve taken a variety of substances, and also travelled\nquite a bit, but I don\u2019t know if I could choose one favorite drug or place. I\u2019m more interested in what is still\nundiscovered \u2013 my favorite trip is my next one.\nHave you written any other books previ-ously?\nYes, I\u2019ve tried my hand at writing for different genres\nunder a different name.\nWhat kinds of books do you enjoy reading?\nWhat are your top books and authors?\nHermann Hesse \u2013 particularly Steppenwolf \u2013 made\na big impression on me.

    "content": "Is the practice of carbon offsetting,\nincreasingly prevalent for both businesses and consumers, a good thing?\nOffsetting assumes that \u201can emission\nreduction achieved in one location has\nthe same beneficial effects as an emission reduction achieved anywhere else\u201d.\nIt suggests that balancing carbon levels\nis a zero-sum game.\nBut the reality is that emissions occurring in one place cannot be equated\nto capture somewhere else. For instance,\na business with a factory emitting high\nlevels of pollutants is still harming the\nlocal community and ecosystem, even if\nthey may be offsetting this emission else-where. And this is just one example of\nthe many problems associated with carbon offsetting - unbeknownst to much\nof the public, there are several issues related to existing offsetting projects that\nmust be considered when determining\nwhether the offset is justified and pro-ductive.\nIssues of pricing and efficacy\nCurrently, purchasing carbon offsets\nis relatively cheap. There are considerable numbers of projects being offered for\nlittle demand, so for businesses, merely\n\u201cmanaging\u201d a non-sustainable business\nmodel of high emission becomes more\nappealing than actually changing their\noperations.\nYet, this is an unsustainable perspective in the long term. Although the\nglobal market for carbon offsetting was\napproximately $300 million in 2018\n(compared to the chocolate market in\nthe UK, which averages at $3bn per\nyear),thisnumberhasbeengrowingrap-idly and is expected to continue rising.\nQuite simply, if companies aim to commit to their net-zero targets or emissions\nreduction targets, they have to reduce\nemissions;there\u2019sonlysomuchlandthat\ncan be used for offsetting.\nIn addition, there are issues\nof offsetting quality, which can\nbe hard to assess. But several\ncertification programmes have\nrevealed the efficiency of existing projects (including non-cer-tified), and only 2% were found\nto be effective at removing emis-sions. The problem here is that\nit is hard to predict how long\nthe trees will stay put with their\nstored carbon, and any climatic or anthropogenic impacts\non that land in the future may\ncompromise this carbon offset\nin the long run.\nOffsetting by consumers\nAnother dubious area of offsetting is those encouraged for\nconsumers. Most commonly\nseen when purchasing plane\ntickets, businesses can offer their customers a chance to pay voluntarily to\noffset the carbon impacts of their activi-ty. While this looks like a good initiative\nthat can help customers feel good, it can\npotentially encourage more unsustainable behaviours compared to if there were\nnooffsettingoptions.Thisistheconcept\nof \u201cself-licensing\u201dandcanbecomeaslippery slope.\nIn addition, asking customers to pay\nto offset the carbon emission of taking\na flight could also be a lazy excuse for\ncompanies not innovating enough towards reducing emissions. For example,\nifplanesarestillflyingwithkerosene,itis\npartly because it\u2019s cheap to produce and\nnot taxed, driving away any need to substitute it. In this case, airline companies\nfail everyone by not using an alternative\nfuel and encouraging customers to bear\ntheir failure. It is simply called green-washing and greenlighting (I coined it\nfrom gaslighting).\nThis type of greenwashing is one of\nthe major risks of offsetting projects.\nInstead of reducing emissions, organisations find ways to carbon offset or push\nit onto their customers.\nLand-grabbing for sustainable management\nThe last issue that is worth mentioning is land grabbing. Carbon offsetting\nprogrammes are supposedly meant to\nincrease the prevalence of sustainably\nmanaged forests. Yet often, if there are\nindigenous tribes or local communities\noccupying potential land for offsetting,\nthey are deemed incapable of handling\nthat land. There have been claims that\nthis was done within some UN REDD+\nprogrammes. All of this is done in the\nname of offsetting our high maintenance lifestyle.\nSo offsetting is still a good thing?\nIt depends on who is in charge and\nwho it is done for. Does offsetting ever\nmake up enough for the previous environmental harm to be compensated for?\nRecently the petrochemical company\nEni has promised to plant trees in Africa\nto become \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2030, through\nthe REDD+ scheme.\nYet, a Greenpeace report has calculated what this PR stunt would mean\nin practice: \u201cthis bold claim may be impossible to achieve as it would require\nenormous tracts of forests to be saved\nfrom deforestation to meet this target\u201d\nand summarising \u201cif ENI was to offset all their emissions [\u2026] using carbon\nprojects in developing countries\u2019 forests,\nthis is nearly impossible. These targets\nwillnotbeachievedwithoutharmtothe\nforest-dependent communities.\u201d\nOverall, voluntary carbon offsets\nmake me think of redemption for our\nconsumption by planting a few trees\nbetween the tropics. Is it a modern take\non the middle-age practice of buying indulgences for a place in heaven? Maybe\nthat\u2019s just how I see it.\nA deep-dive into carbon off-setting: understanding its\ncomplexities\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nL\u00e9a Haber Environment Writer\n10\nENVIRONMENT\n\n"

    "content": "Besides disease and predation, living\nbeings die mainly due to ageing,\nwhich is defined as the gradual organic\ndeterioration of the body. Many factors,\nsuch as gene mutation or oxidation\ndamage, can cause ageing. However, an\ninteresting idea for the possible cause\nof ageing has been gaining traction in\nthe scientific community. What if death\nwas programmed? Here, we are going to\ndiscuss why many organisms, if not all,\nare \"programmed\" to die after a certain\ntime.\nNatural selection is the master of deciding which traits perpetuate over time,\nincluding lifespan. A common miscon-ceptionisthatanimalsthatlivelongerdo\nso only because they have more opportunities to copulate and hence, have more\noffspring. But this assumption does not\ntake into account the Malthusian law,\nwhich explains that although the rate\nof proliferation of living beings is exponential and almost infinite, the limited\nquantity of resources available in the environment limits the number of individ-uals, and creates competition between\nthem. If an organism can both reproduce incredibly fast and live incredibly\nlong, the ecosystem would eventually be\nunable to support that population, causing resources to run out and resulting in\nthe death of the population. Therefore,\nnatural selection has generally favoured\nspecies that can self-regulate their popu-lations. How do you control the number\nof individuals while keeping acceptable\nbirth rates? The answer is death. There\nis no more scandalous but correct oxymoron than \"for life, you must also have\ndeath\". Constantly producing new organisms has many evolutionary advantages (for example, higher genetic variability in the population that increases\nits fitness to environmental changes).\nDeath is the removal of older members\nto give more resources and space for new\ngenerations so that they can thrive in an\nenvironment with less competition. This\ngives their offspring, which can carry\non their genes, more chance of surviv-al, because there is less competition for\nresources. Specific examples of strategically programmed death are present in\nnature. For instance, the octopus is an\nanimal that only reproduces once in its\nlifetime and dies soon after, even though\nthe parent is perfectly healthy. Studies\ncarriedoutbyDr.JeromeWodinskyhave\nshown that octopuses have a hormonal\ngland that triggers this abrupt death. If\nthe hormonal gland is extirpated, then\nthe octopus can copulate many times.\nHamsters,withluck,canliveuptoseven years, while elephants older than 50\nare common. Why such a great disparity\nin longevity? If we analyse the longevity\nof all living beings, from simple bacteria\nto huge whales, we discern a pattern: the\nbigger the animal is, the longer it lives.\nWhy do bigger organisms live longer?\nA common argument is that bigger is\nusually associated with lower metabolic\nrates, so the cells of the body grow and\ndie slower, and hence ageing is slower.\nBut this has contradictions. For exam-ple, smaller dogs live longer than bigger\nones. Even though we do not have a definitive physiological answer, researchers\nhave attempted to induce a reason from\nan evolutionary perspective. Research\nhas suggested that in general, animals\ntend to evolve towards larger sizes and\nlonger lives. Why would that be, when\nwe have established that too high longevity and reproductive rates are unsustainable for the survival of an individual\u2019s offspring? Balance and trade-offs are\nkey. Bacteria live some days but reproduce in minutes. It is not surprising today to see humans surpassing the barrier\nof 70 years. However, their reproductive\nrates are in timeframes of almost a year.\nLong-life animals compensate for their\nlonger lives with lower offspring yields,\nso they keep up the population size in\nhealthy numbers. However, nature provides plenty of exceptions. For example,\nthe pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis grows very slowly compared\nto other types of bacteria, taking around\n48 hours to divide! The reason for this\nslow growth rate is due to its cell wall,\nwhich is very costly to make and is also\na highly complex biological structures\nwith many molecules and layers.\nHumans that live more than 100 years\nusually share similar characteristics:\nstress-free life, no drugs, regular exercise,\nand healthy diets. However, there is also\na genetic component. It is estimated that\naround 25% of the longevity of a human\nis determined by its genetic inheritance.\nStudies have shown that relatives of centenarians have a higher probability of\nbeing centenarians and are at lower risk\nof contracting age-related diseases such\nas cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s. Identifying\nand isolating the genes unique in centenarians will help us to develop novel an-ti-ageing therapies and drugs.\nWe do not live in the natural wild\nworld anymore. We have created our\nownworldwithitsownrules,particular-ly because of developments in medicine.\nThere is no need for humans to follow\nthe rules of Mother Nature or be considered old at 25-30 years, as would have\nbeen the case a thousand years ago. We\ncan change the genetic mechanisms that\ncause ageing to live longer and healthier\nlives.\nFRIDAY 18TH MARCH 2022\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nAre we programmed to die?\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nA frog's life stages, from tadpole to death\nGreater blue-ringed octopus with its eggs.

Pigs were found to\nhave higher-pitched calls such as screams and squeals when \u201cstressed\nand scared\u201d, and emitted low grunts when \u201chappy or excited\u201d. They were\nrecorded in a range of positive and negative scnaerios. Positive scenarios\nincluded seeing family after a period of separation, and negative scenarios\nranged from isolation to castration and slaughter. They were recorded\nin a commercial environment and in experimental scenarios.

    "content": "It\u2019s January 5th, 2007, at the Sydney\nCricket Ground. The final runs and\nwickets of a long Ashes are underway.\nAndrew Flintoff is on strike - a desperate captain attempting to prevent yet\nanother clean sweep\nDown Under. A spinning delivery comes\ndown the track and\nturns ever-so-slightly;\nit misses Flintoff\u2019s bat\nand Gilchrist is quick\nto stump. A review\ngoes up and is ruled\nout as Flintoff is seen outside the popping crease. England are now 113/5.\nThis moment in cricket, ordinary as it\nmight seem, occurred at roughly 3:30 in\nthe afternoon, Sydney time. It was the final wicket of Shane Warne\u2019s international career. A bow of the hat followed - a\nmoment captured - that has since gone\ndown in history and become the computer wallpaper of many aspiring leg\nspinners. The demise of Shane Warne at\nthe young age of 52 has left the cricket-ing community indigent; shocked and\ndespaired, no one knowing how to come\nto terms with what Shane\nmeant to everyone around\nhim.\nShane is what cricket is\nall about. He came into the\nsport at the autumn of the\nBorders and Gavaskars. He\nwas trained with aegis of\nlegends who had perfected rhythm of\nthe sport. Shane, however, was unique -he brought forward a markedly unique\nenergy to the game. Akin to the neoliberals of 1400\u2019s France, Shane carried\nthe values and core competencies of a\ndisciplined Australian team but added\nhis own flare to\nit - his own story\nof development.\nThroughout his\njourney, he was a\nman of psychological brutalism -he would trap batters with a plan of\nattack- one which\nthey simply could\nnot survive. Many\nwould argue that\nplaying Shane was\nas difficult as a\n100mph bounc-er. He had the\nability of natural\nvariation paired\nwith reading surfaces to perfec-tion. Every ball\nthat came out of\nhis hand had intent of pursuit- a\nchess like mindset\nto trap the opposition and leave\nthem, quite liter-ally, stumped.\nAs a leg spinner, he is by far the gold\nstandard in the extent of spin and the\nability to adapt to different batting\nstyles, track conditions, and team dy-namics. His 1000+ international wickets have been filled with class and rigor -very few instances of luck or fortune. By\nhisownadmission,hewasahardworker.\nHe put his heart and soul into bringing a\nlevel of reliability into his performance.\nHis ability to work with teammates in\n\u201csetting-up\u201d a batter was better than\nmost sci-fi movies. A captain\u2019s favorite,\nShane Warne warranted a popcorn and\nbeer from most of his fans because of\nthe way he would have viewers glued\nto the screen; because whenever he was\nbowling, something was about to hap-pen. In many ways, Shane Warne redefined the role of a leg spinner, away from\nthe loopy half-trackers and full tosses,\nShane Warne showed that a leg spinner\ncould be an astute and bold dynamitist.\nFollowing his career, leg spin became a\npopulist mantra - players from around\nthe world dreamt to be Shane Warne,\nmimicking his unique action, and maintaining a level of boisterousness on the\nfield. Many of those players, today, lead\nas spearheads for their sides.\nShane\u2019s impact, however, goes beyond\nhim being a bowler. As an analyst of the\ngame, he was always a progressive. As a\ncommentator or\nas a mentor, he\nworked with players from around\nthe world to pass\nhis knowledge and\nshare unique ways\nof bringing out the\nbest in a person.\nMany bowlers today credit mere\nconversations that\nthey had with\nShane as inspirations for their performance - a catalyst for their propensity\nand confidence. Shane was also a cogent\ncritic of the game. He called out things\nas he saw them - seldom hesitating from\nfear of dispute. When Shane had an\nopinion, he made sure to say it. Even if\nthey weren\u2019t as popular, he would have\nhis thoughts out in the open. It may\nhave even landed him in trouble, but\nhe was sure to make it about the game\n- stepping away from pejoratives. Shane\nlooked people in the eyes and told them\nof a vision he dreamt of for the game.\nHis boldness was always complimented by kindness and apathy, making him\nsomeone everyone liked.\nWith Shane no-longer part of the\ncricketing establishment, the commentator\u2019s box will feel empty and void of\na shrewd laughter. The pre-game chats\nwill never have the same didactic per-sona. Upcoming leg spinners who want\nadvice on wrist\npositions or mind\ngames will never\nhave the insight of\ntheir idol. Shane\nwill leave behind\na legacy which no\none could possibly fathom to ever\nfill. Reflections on\nwhat he meant to\nplayers and fans at\nan individual level\nwill outpour, stemming from a desire to\nhear what he has to say. The cricketing\nworld mourns his passing and will wish\nto have one final beer and a smoke with\ntheir favorite Victorian.\nRest in peace, King Of Spin.\nFRIDAY 18TH MARCH 2022\n29\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nA Tribute to the King of Spin\nPranjal Mathur\nEnvironment Writer\nEdited by: Amanda Barden\nKonrad Hohendorf\nSport\n\u201c\nSHANE\nIS WHAT\nCRICKET IS\nABOUT\n\u201c\nSHANE WILL LEAVE\nBEHIND A LERGACY\nWHICH NO ONE\nCOULD POSSIBLY\nFATHOM TO EVER\nFILL\nShane Warne. bowling in 2009\nStatue of Shane Warne in MCG\n\n"

Inspired by the\nstructure of operations constructed by quantum\ncomputing, each variation of this song maintains the\nexact first and final lines but each line in-between\nbranches off from the previous line. For instance,\nline two may have two options, then for each of these\noptions there would be two more options for how the\nthird line would play. The branching pattern differs\neach verse, but totals to 2,048 lyrical variations.\nIn addition to 280 possible musical variations, the\nalgorithm could in total generate 573,440 versions of\nthis one song \u2013 it would take you 1,571 years to listen\nonce through each version, assuming no repeats.\nThe creators Martin Austwick and Jeff Emtman\nexperiment with how far they can incorporate\ndynamism into podcasts. The closest to this concept\nto date has been just the geographic targeting of\ndynamic podcast advertising. Further enhancements\nto Neutrinowatch are bubbling behind the scenes:\nAustwick and Emtman work hard to enhance this\nunique listener experience, attempting to add geographic targeting into the mix, such as giving local\nweather reports.\nPlaced into a fascinating, AI-dominant and phys-ics-themed fictional storyline that is further explored\nin other episodes, perhaps this approach offers an\nobjective and distanced perspective on how our lives\ntake their course.\nBelow are the lyrics for 15th March 2022 for\nreference \u2013 which version are you listening to today?\nRemember to stream the episodes for daily updates,\nand I thoroughly hope you will also enjoy the fun I\nhave had with it this past month. Lyrics generated\nTuesday, 15th March 2022 02:03 UTC/GMT:\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThirteen songs for just letting go\nWritten by Ambika Bharadwaj Music Writer\nBecause you cannot sit and stare at your wounds forever\nFelix Recommends\nSomeone has to leave first - this is a very old story,\nand there is no other version to it. Every once in a\nwhile, some poorly suppressed memory rises to the surface and I am back in the graveyard in my head for relationships of the past, the tombstones are the proof that\nI paid the price. I find it fascinating that, person after\nperson, they all converge at one moment, irrevocably\nchanging the course of my life. As it is with accidents,\nso it is with love. I have seen my own sun darkened, and\nthese are just some songs that allowed me to put my\npain into words.\n\u2018when was it over?\u2019 - Sasha\nAlex Sloan (feat. Sam Hunt)\nSasha Sloan paired with Sam\nHunt for this vulnerable ballad\nthat finds the two trying to\npinpoint what precise moment\nled to the demise of their\nrelationship. The song is about not being able to let go\nof someone even when you know there\u2019s nothing left.\n\u2018are you okay?\u2019 - Winnetka Bowling League\nI haven\u2019t heard a song that\u2019s consistently moved me\nto tears the way this has. I\nthink one of the reasons why\nthe musical imagery stands\nout so much is that we have\nall tried to look back into\nthe past and reach out to a\nfailed relationship. For me in\nparticular, I have struggled\nMUSIC\nThere\u2019s only the world outside my window\nA movement in the branches caught my eye\nThat concludes this morning\u2019s entertainment\nI still can\u2019t tell a starling from a magpie\nI\u2019m not a librarian, I just look on in awe\nSo I won\u2019t feel alone in this world anymore\nI know the sun won\u2019t set the clouds on fire\nI think I saw my shadow walk away\nI\u2019m lying if I tell you I\u2019m a river\nFingertips whose work is gentle play\nSometimes life\u2019s like staring at a novel\nA book that\u2019s far too complex for me to read\nBut I\u2019m aware of patterns in the water\nOne day those waves will come right here to me\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not frightening\nAs they\u2019re arriving at my door\nBut I won\u2019t feel alone in this world anymore\nI am a sucker for coordination and choreography,\nand Happenstance came with both. The band came on\nstage all in white shirts, followed by lead singer Ana\n(who did not ask the crowd her own name but I\u2019m\nfriends with) in a black dress. With a 150% increase in\npractices for the final (3) from the heats (2), the band\nwere just as tight and impressive as before. Again, the\nonly trouble in the set arose from a less than perfect sound mix; the horns that formed a substantial\nbacking for the band were usually inaudible. This was\ndevastating because the horn section, for the parts\nwe could hear, was incredible. With two lead singers,\nHappenstance offered the most diverse set ranging\nfrom rocky hits like \u2018Beggin\u2019\u2019 to soft soul covers like\n\u2018Easy\u2019. Even though the band admitted themselves that\nthey had a lower energy than the other bands of the\nnight, they still managed to get the crowd involved\nwith everyone singing along to \u2018Ain\u2019t No Mountain\nHigh\u2019 and \u2018Valerie\u2019: the final track that had the whole\ncrowd on trampolines.\nThe new kid on the block (well, as far as I know\nbecause I\u2019ve never seen them before) is a huge surprise.\nWinston The Cat has been plucked out of the \u201890s\ngrunge era and the lead singer has the same pained but\ntired energy that Kurt Cobain had. Their set, which\nincludes the Beatles, Kings of Leon, Red Hot Chilli\nPeppers, and Foo Fighters, was incredibly varied, yet\nsimilar somehow. The lead vocalist\u2019s raw and rough-on-the-edges vocals are bent and twisted to fit this\nsetlist spanning the eras. From the dishevelled \u201860s\nblues that comes with \u2018Yer Blues\u2019 by the Beatles, to the\ngrowing angst-y passion of \u2018Everlong\u2019, Winston the\nCat\u2019s sound was dynamic, yet still maintaining a little\nsomething that was unmistakably theirs.\nAll in all, we were incredibly impressed with the\nbands, who showed impressive audience engagement,\ncontrol of tone, and \u2013 as always \u2013 other-worldly\ninstrumentalists. And a huge shout out to the DJs who\nmade the waiting period for the results a funky disco.\nI never dance to anything a DJ produces, but best\nbelieve I forced all my friends to show off any moves I\ncould remember from Saturday Night Fever.\n\n"

    "content": "IS WATER POLO A\nPROBLEM FOR\nDRINKING?\nBackground\nThe present study aims to investigate the existence\nof a correlation between faster pint and reef times\nwith better water polo performance. There has been\nincreasing concern over the last 3 years that \u201cThe\ndrinking club with a water polo problem\u201d has been\nburdened by an ever-worsening \u201cwater polo\nproblem\u201d. With the club having beaten IC at varsity\nlast year, the 1st team having beaten IC 1st team in\nthe water and only lost 1 match this season it is\nclear that these concerns are well justified. Hence,\nmotivation behind the study is two-fold:\ninvestigating the existence of such a correlation\ncould help the club curb the \u201cwater polo problem\u201d\nand bragging rights for individual members with the\nbest pint and reef times.\nBy Miguel Armstrong, Nia Davies, Nicholas Lawson, Esther Cho, Lorenzo Verani, Laurie Edwards Peer reviewed by Christian Oldfield\nFig 1. This scatter chart clearly shows the negative correlation between\npolo ability and reef time (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.4434).\nFig 2. This scatter chart clearly shows the negative correlation between\npolo ability and pint time (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.3484).\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional cohort study involved data\ncollection between 01/02/22 and 23/02/22, most\ndata was collected on 16/02/22 (now known as WP\ncensus day). In cases where data could not be\ncollected prospectively (such as alumni), data was\ncollected retrospectively. In almost all cases pint and\nreef times were measured by two suitably\ninebriated timekeepers and a mean was taken.\nWater polo ability was assessed according to team\nrepresentation at matches and training attendance.\nResults\nDiscussion\nThe results clearly indicate that there is a correlation between both faster pint and reef times and increased water polo ability. This poses\ninteresting ramifications for \u201cThe drinking club with a water polo problem\u201d as it may be possible that by increasing an individual\u2019s drinking\nability through means such as regular Sports Nights the club may be inadvertently worsening its \u201cwater polo problem\u201d. It is equally possible\nthat increased water polo training has increased members drinking ability.\nHowever, it is still unclear whether there is a causative link between the variables investigated in this study and hence there is room for\nfurther investigations. An interesting proposal would be for a future 1st team captain to increase compulsory attendance of post- training\nand match pints to see if this has a measurable effect on the team\u2019s success in the pool.\nIn conclusion, both faster reef and pint times correlate to an increased water\npolo ability. The maintenance of an up-to-date WP census database will aid\nany similar studies in the future. We would like to encourage other clubs and\nsocieties to investigate the existence of any similar correlations.\nConclusion\nSpecial mentions\nNicholas Lawson - Fastest pint 3.67\nLudovico Buizza - Fastest Reef 2.64 (query...)\nChristian Oldfield - Fastest combined pint and Reef time 7.05\nGK - Happy Birthday!\nFor reference, the club had an average pint time of 8.85 and reef time of\n5.26. Current literature does not indicate any clubs with faster pint or reef\ntimes.\nReef did not sponsor\nthis study\nPlease note all data collected and used in this study is real!\n\n"

    "content": "Power, corruption, and lies take centre stage in Oliver Mears\u2019 production of Rigoletto which returns\nto the Royal Opera House after its premi\u00e8re in September. Set in the court of the Duke of Mantua, Mears\u2019\ndark take on the opera does not shy away from examining the dark underbelly of hedonism, the unscrupu-lousness, and the debris left in the wake of the libertine\nlifestyle. But Mears goes deeper. His production confronts the legacy of toxic masculinity in western art,\nforcing its audience not to be swept away with the gorgeous music, but to drill deep into their own psyche to\nunravel how the male gaze has shaped our understanding of art and society.\nLuca Salsi\u2019s Rigoletto was electric as the tragic hero\ntrapped between his life as the jester at the Duke\u2019s mor-allybankruptcourt,andasafathertryingtoprotecthis\ndaughter. As his worlds collide Rigoletto\u2019s descent into\nviolence was as enthralling as it was tragic, with a deep\nmelancholy woven into his vocal texture. Salsi drew\nout Verdi\u2019s infatuation with Shakespeare by channelling both Shylock and Lear in Rigoletto\u2019s duality as a\nbitter outsider and a loving father. Rigoletto\u2019s daughter\nGilda, performed by Rosa Feola, was the strongest vo-cally, hitting her high notes with confidence and ease,\nandconveyingGilda\u2019sdemisewithtendernessanddeep\naffection for her father.\nBut the production was most interested in examining the Duke of Manuta. Beneath the slicked back hair,\nvelvet dinner jackets, and bravado, Francesco Demuro\u2019s\nDuke was devilishly animalistic. Although his higher\nnotes were sometimes tense and rough, he artfully captured the Duke\u2019s licentiousness and narcissism - painting a picture of man corrupted by unabashed greed, a\nnymphomaniac, the 19th century\u2019s answer to The Tinder Swindler.\nTalkingofpaintings,ablown-upOdalisquedangled\nover the vast stage in act one as the Duke, accompanied\nby his court, a crowd of lavishly dressed men, taunt and\nseduce women; the sickening power of the male gaze\nbrought into full view by set designer Simon Lima\nHoldsworth. In the second act it is replaced by another\nimage: Titan\u2019s Rape of Europa, where the line between\nbeast and man is disconcertingly skewed.\nThe opera\u2019s most famous tune, \u201cLa donna e mobile\u201d,\nwas haunted by this lingering darkness; the Duke sings\nthe upbeat song whilst unceremoniously paying a prostitute for sex. The lavish renaissance art is nowhere to\nbe seen. Just the prostitute\u2019s dingy, barren, and dimly\nlit room. The impunity of his Epicurean philosophy is\nperhaps most disturbing. After all the crimes he commits there is no comeuppance. He is untouchable.\nMears\u2019 production plays out like a psychodrama. It\nis dark and difficult to digest. But in an artistic tradition where many inherited tropes and concepts were\nforged in less egalitarian sensibilities, we need operas\nto reflect on the legacies of their own moral outlook.\nRigoletto does exactly this.\nFRIDAY 18TH MARCH 2022\n13\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCredits: Photo/Helen Murray\nPower, corruption, and lies take centre stage in Oliver Mears\u2019 production of Rigoletto returning to the ROH.\nPower, corruption, and lies\nOpera\nThat\u2019s a wrap on the semester...\nBut there\u2019s more arts\ncontent online!\nCheck out our website for\nthe latest reviews!\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nRigoletto\nReviewed by Alexander Cohen Arts Editor\nWhere?

    "content": "as some were rather subtle. This to me is not only a sign\nof great literature, but also well-executed direction.\nAnd, whatever else was happening on it, the stage\nwas an active part of the drama, a vivid character in it-self. To a certain degree this was necessary \u2014 the whole\nplay was performed in the genuinely beautiful Belarussian language, so I was relying on the subtitles in the\nbackground. But it goes far beyond that: Whenever\nsomeone was smoking a cigar, or books were burning,\na pungent smell was noticeable throughout the whole\ntheatre; the stage lights drawing our attention to pair\nof shoes; the awesome outfits highlighting the character\u2019s ridiculous features; and so on. As an audience we\nhad no other choice than to be dragged into this visceral mess \u2014 what a delight!\nThe absurdity and intensity of experience will naturally be polarising. Features like flashing lights and\nfast-paced music are demanding, and a run time of\nthree hours guarantee that you will be in for a ride.

Boy meets girl, boy does something\nstupid and loses girl, girl changes her outfit, and they\nget back together. Rife with misogyny, sexism and\nslut-shaming, Grease somehow still retains its status as\na timeless classic, a guilty pleasure for many. Musical\nTheatre Soc\u2019s rendition of Grease glosses over some\nof the problematic themes with an enthusiastic and\npassionate cast equipped with some snazzy tunes and\nradical moves.\nCecilia Longoni is an unassailable Sandy Dumbrowski and her performance of \u201cHopelessly Devoted\u201d\nwas one of the best solo acts of the show. Tess Goudsward as Marty, Olivia Keene as Frenchy and Noemi\nHerrera Martin as Betty Rizzo beautifully captured\nthe girl gang and the trial and tribulations of teenage\nboy drama, set alongside the bromance between Kenickie (Fin Corney), Sonny (Isabella Breslin), Doody\n(Manuel Gageiro) and of course, the darling of Rydell\nHigh, Harry McCarthy as Danny Zuko.\nMyrabeth Yeo Juann as Jan and George Chipperfield as Roger were outstanding and hilarious in their\ntre-moon-dous performances and brought an electric\nenergy to the performances which got the audience\nclapping and swaying along. Where the show lacked in\nsound testing and volume control for mics, they made\nup by the commitment of the actors and their show-must-go-on attitude. The set designers did a fantastic\njob of bringing \u201cGreased Lightning\u201d to stage: preserving the dilapidated state of the car, keeping a macho\nposturing with just cardboard. From costumes to the\nslicked hair, to piercings during sleepovers, Grease portrayed a bygone era.\nHowever, considering the current social climate, I\nwould\u2019ve appreciated if the production had addressed\nthe themes of date rape, promiscuity, and spiking by\nVince Fontaine (Shapeetha Ariyaratnam) without the\ndesensitisationaccompaniedbytheoriginalmovie-mu-sical sensation. At face value Grease is a light-hearted\nand cheery show but ignoring the issues it brings up\ndoes not help the social tone we set today on campus\nand just recreating this classic was not enough. Nevertheless, this production does bring up a conversation\nwhich is still important.\nOverall, Grease was a wonderful production by the\nMusical Theatre Society, in a performance that clearly\nshowed hard work and dedication.
