Each issue of Felix'costs about \u00a350 to\nproduce; this is just about covered by advertising revenue on an\naverage issue plus what is made on sales. An issue without adverts,\nmust be sub sidi sed to the tune of \u00a320 to \u00a330, depending on the\nnumber of pages and number printed. It may be possible to find\nsufficient cash to produce another issue this term, so as to complete the record of Union events with an issue dealing with the\nelections, but in case this is not possible, the Editor would like to\nput on record now his gratitude to the Felix staff for the work that\nthey have put in this year, \"Staff\" must include not only those\nwhose names appear on this page, but also all those who have\nsubmitted articles at the Editor's request, especially those connected\nwith the series of profiles. A special vote of thanks is due to the\nmuch maligned Mr. Phillips (of Council fame), who originally suggested the series, and who has been instrumental in keeping it going.\nThe Editor has indeed been fortunate in his staff, and he hopes\nthat any still interested in Felix next session will give the next Editor\nthe same sterling service.\nSMALL ADS\nFOR SALE 150 c.c.

Newly elected Captains or\nresidents wishing to publicise\ntheir club or society in this particular issue are invited to submit\narticles by the end of this term,\nor during the vacation to: The\nEditor, c/o Imperial College\nUnion.\nAnyone interested in joining\nthe Felix staff for next year in\nany capacity, is also invited to\nsee either the present Editor, or\nthe Advertising Manager.\nCongratulations to the Carnival Committee \u2014 they collected\n\u00a32,000 approx for Freedom from\nHunger or was it War on Want ?\nWell, I'm sure that it was a worthy charity, whatever it was!\nI wonder if Asit knows which\ncharity we are supporting? He\nwasn't at the Carnival Fete,\nalthough Alma Cogan dreamt\nthat she had seen him. In fact\nthe only Carnival function that he\nwent to was the International\nEvening, which happened to follow the Rector's Sherry Party.\nSeriously chaps, the Pres\u00bb is doing a grand job.\nSurely the Masked Festival in\nthe Union was the best social at\nIC for some time. Let us hope\nthat it will have done something\nto put our hops back on the map\nagain. (This should in no way\nbe construed as a criticism of\nthe Chairman of Ents.) It was\na success because it was different.\nI hope that next year's Entertainments Committee will not be\nafraid to try something different\noccasionally. People do tend to\nget tired of Carnivals, and common or garden Saturday Hops.\nStynx, however, was no credit\nto the College; it really was scraps\ning the barrel. The Rector was\nquite justified in objecting to his\nname being associated with this\nfilthy rubbish. Surely IC can produce a Carnival Magazine that\nwe can be proud of.. The first\nrate material used in the Carnival\nrevue showed that there is talent\nin the College capable of producing humour without crudity.\nThe last Council meeting was a farce. Lacking any positive\ndirection from the Chairman, who\ndidn't seem to care what was\ndecided, so long as it was decided\nquickly, the meeting was dragged\ndown to apu rile level by the\nbuffoonery of certain individuals\nwho were allowed to prattle on\nquite aimlessly. Thank goodness\nthey voted against a fruit machine\nin the Union, but surely they\nclanged on the Carnival Organiser\nissue. Apparently, the poor chap\ndoesn't want to sit on Council\nanyway, he could be invited along\nto the meetings dealing with matters concerning him, or better\nstill, a member of Council could\nbe elected to sit on the Carnival\nCommittee. If they haven't' the\ntime to take an active part in running the Union, they should not\nbe sitting on Council anyway. The\nway things are going, the Editors\nof Phoenix and Felix will be on\nCouncil, and that will still leave\nthe Hyde Park Road Relay\nOrganisers out.\nElection time is here again, and\nall the King Makers are at work\nplotting the destiny of the Union.\nI 've heard at least six candidates\nfor President mentioned in Union\ncircles. Is it just possible that\nwe will have an election this year?\nI bet that it is all arranged beforehand again, with all but one\nchickening out before Joint Council.\nThe SCC Chairmanship is being\ncontested anyway, though the rest\nof the Committee seems to have\nbeen more or less arranged by\nthat very active Society that is in\nthe process of changing its name.\nI wonder if that chap who seems\nto be keeping a constant vigil by\nthe nominations board. soliciting\nfor second ers will get the Chairmanship?\nThe ACC took a hammering\nfrom Pearson in his 1894 Council\nMeeting Minutes in the last issue\nof Felix. His dismal prediction\nthat the Debating Society will be\ndefunct by then may well be fulfilled if the present trend con-tin u es. After a very uninspired\nyear, the Society is having difficulty in finding a Chairman for\nnext session. It is about time\nsomebody took over, and put the\nSociety where it belongs\u2014the top\nSociety in the College. There are\ntoo many societies in the College\nwithout a common goal. The\nDebating Society could pull them\nall together by organising some\ncontroversial debates between\nthe \" n\" political societies, the\n\" n plus 1\" religious societies, and\nthe \"n plus n\" national societies.\nTo gain in strength they must\nhave a very much more integrated\nprogramme, with some co-opera-tion between the \"rival\" factions.\nForming new bodies, like the\nFlat Earth Society constituted at\nthe last Council Meeting, is not\nthe answer to the problem that\nfaces the Social Clubs at IC.\nCouncil Meeting\nMay 13thB.

    "content": "6 FELIX BOAT CLUB\nalias last report of Boat Club Gazette\nThe College has been represented at four regattas this term,\nall on the tide way. Our first success of the season was marked up\nat the Vesta Dashes, held over a short course at Putney, when Bob\nLutz won Junior Senior Sculls. The second VIII made its first\nappearance but could not hold Crowland RC in the Junior Senior\nEights. After a poor start, the IC rowed steadily at 40 to Crowland's43, and finished \u00a7 lengths down.\nMortlake was the first regatta of the season and Simon Adlam\nthe first to show the IC colours. He has not rowed seriously this\nyear in order to get some work done, and proved too unfit to get\nvery far. Two novice eights were\nentered, the Gents and Beta. The\nGents lost to Kings College in the\nfirst round in a rather uncomfortable row, while Beta beat\nStaveley Schools and the Met.\nPolice, going through to the final.\nHere they wisely chose to row in\nthe good water rather than in the\nstream, but lost all the same, to\na good Quintin School eight.\nAt Putney, the improving\nGents beat the Royal Vets in a very close race. Level at the\nIC Boathouse, they just managed\nto get their bows in front at the\nfinish. They won by two feet,\nbut were knocked out in the next\nround by Monkton Combe.\nAlpha, the IC 5th eight, had a poor start, and did not recover,\nlosing by two lengths to Kings\n1st VIII.\nHammersmith Regatta went\noff to a promising start on May\n11th. Bruno Vieri, our JuniorSenior scull er, reported to the\nstart with the umpire but no\nopposition. He was awarded a row over. It later turned out that\nhis opponents went to the other\nend of the course, due to some\ndoubt about the tides. In the\nfinal, Vieri was narrowly defeated by J. Jennings,\nIn the Junior-Senior VIII's the\n2nd VIII rowed well to beat\nChiswick Grammar School com-fort ably. Rowing upstream in\nbad water, they drew_ away from\nthe school in the second half of\nthe course. In the final, IC\nstarted between St. Paul's School\nand Horseferry R.C.; the School\nused their superior weight to ad-vantage, and were soon in the\nlead. Horseferry took half a length off IC initially, but could\nnot hold this advantage, as the\n2nd VIII fought back, to finish\nhalf a length clear.\nThe 3rd VII, rowing Juniors,\nheld IBIS over most of the upstream course, but lost ground\nin the last few hundred yards,\nwhen rounding Harrod's wharf,\nthey met a strong headwind. In\nthe Novice Eights, Alpha\nthrashed the Metropolitan Police\nand went on to race Kingston\nRC. Although they had one of\ntheir best rows this season, they\ncould not match Kingston's superior weight and experience,\nand, after a good fight, Kingston\ntook a lead of two lengths.\nSTOP\nPRESS!\nALLOM CUP\nRETURNS\nTHREE-UPMAN-SHIP AT UL\nSaturday, May 18th, saw ICBC\nshowing the flag at the University Boat House at Chiswick.\nThere were six IC entries\u2014\u2022first\nand second eights, Alpha and the\nGents, a cox less four, and Bruno\nVieri the lone sculling entrant.\nThe novice crews and the four\nwere knocked out of the Clinker\nEights in the first heats in the\nmorning, but the record was\nevened out by the other entrants.\nIn a re-row following a dead-heat, the first eight beat UC to\nregain the Allom Cup for IC, and\nthe second eight followed this up\nby retaining the Roderick Hill\nCup.\nThings looked black for UL\u2014.\nthe UC crew that,was beaten by\nthe first eight was more or less\nthe UL Second VIII. The point\nwas brought home even more\nstrongly by Bruno Vieri in the\nPotter Cup, who went up on his\nopponent at the start, and then\nproceeded to grind him into the\ndust, being over a hundred yards\nup at the finish. His opponent ?\nNone other than John Kinnear,\nCaptain of UL Boat Club.\nSUMMER HOCKEY\nIC narrowly lost their first\nsummer hockey match to the\nBlackheath \"Outcasts\" 4\u20143 at\nat Harlington last Thursday\nnight. The IC goals were scored\nby Peters, Phillips and Dave\nHardwicke, the sub warden designate of Selkirk Hall, who was\nplaying right half for Blackheath\nat the time!\nThere are two more fixtures\nthis term, against UL U and\nKingston Grammar School.\nIC CRICKET CLUB\nSince only five players of last\nyear's1st eleven remained at College and over ten regular 1st XI players had left, prospects for\nthis season did not look good.\nThere was a good turnout of\nfresher s at the trials and it is due\nto their enthusiasm that the Club\nhas been able to turn out three\nsides mid-week and four on\nweek-ends.\nThe 1st XI this year would\nseem to have one of the strongest\nbowling sides for some time,\nthough unfortunately the same\ncannot be said of the batting, and\nthe fielding leaves much to be de-sired. A feature of the attack\nhas been the controlled leg-spin\nbowling of Reg Talbot who tops\nthe bowling averages (for the pre-sent) acting as a foil for the pace-men Bland, Flynn and Williams.\nThe batting which has been\nstrengthened from time to time\nby the appearance of Sastri, has\ndepended mainly on Penberthy,\nTopliss and Bland, supported by\nAhmed. The Club has also been\nlucky to get an accomplished\nwicket keeper-batsman in Eastell.\nThe record of the 1st XI up to\ndate is played 5, won 3, drawn 1\nand lost 1.\nResults (1st XI):\nv. Middx. Hospital lost by 1\nwicket.\nIC 61 (Penberthy 22), Middx.\nHosp. 62\u20149 (Bland 4\u201420).\nv. Eastcote. Won by 16 runs.\nIC 181 (Penberthy 45, Sastri\n38, Ahmed \u2022 33), Eastcote 165\n(Flynn 5\u201440, Sastri 4\u201464).\nv. St. Marks and St. John won\nby 88 runs.\nIC 209\u20147 declared (Eastell 63,\nAhmed 41, Topliss 49 not out),\nMarJohns 121 (Talbot 5\u201432,\nFlynn 4\u201424).\nv. West Indian Students match\ndrawn. \u2022\nIC 155 (Sastri 58), West Indians\n118\u20148.\nv. Linden Park, won by three\nwickets.\nLinden Park 97 (Flynn 6\u201448,\nTalbot 3\u20147), IC 98\u20147 (Bland\n35).\nThe 2nd XI under Satch had\nmixed success, beating Goldsmiths II and Clements, losing to\nLSE II and QM C II and drawing with Albanians. The only\nperformance of note has been the\nbatting of Cleare, who carried his\nbat for 55 against Clements, and\nthe bowling of Rice (9\u201434 v. Goldsmiths, 5\u201425 v. Clements).\nThe less said about the third\neleven the better, though it must\nbe granted that they do not let\ndefeats dampen their enthusiasm.\nThe fourth, known as P. Stevenson's XI, or the Chemical Abstracts, have had two rousing\ngames with Kings 4th, losing one\nand drawing the other. Turning\nout in apparel of varying hues,\nthey have played cricket in the\ntrue sense of the word\u2014a certain\nUniversity soccer Purole scored\na professional 44 out of the 61 in\nthe second game.\nWe are looking forward to a successful tour in Devon starting\non Tuesday, June 25th. Prospective tourists please note. The\nSunday XI, under John Preece,\nhave won two games out of three.\nButt has scored 104 not out, 68\nand 54 in successive knocks,\nthough steadily refusing to turn\nout more often.\nThe great pity is that in a College that regularly managed nine\nrug ger XVs, nine soccer XIs and\nfour hockey XIs, the Cricket\nClub can only manage three\nregular XIs\u2014a tribute to the Examania that so many succumb to\nthis time of year.\nM.

It has always been in the\nCup matches that IC tennis has\nstumbled, and it is hoped that the\npresent team, whose third pair is\nclose in standard to the first, will\nbring the cup back to IC.\nA Club play session was held\non Wednesday 8th May which\nwas most successful until tea time.\nHowever, a suitable alternative\nwas suggested by C.

    "content": "CARNIVAL\nContinued from page I to follow up in the evening, but\nwere were in for as up rise. The\nUnion had been decorated in festive mood and around eight'\no 'clock the crowds began to\nfilter, nay flood, into the building.\nIt became apparent that the lively\nadvertising campaign to which\nthe Carnival had treated itself\nwas going to pay dividends. A conservative estimate put the\nnumbers in the building at twelve\nhundred\u2014surely the biggest event\nof this sort ever held at Imperial.\nIt should be noted at this point\nthat many of the people in the\nUnion found themselves there\nwithout having paid the entrance\nfee, which is not, it must be said,\na reflection of the general moral\nattitude at I.C.? However, despite this, the evening was a tremendous success, due in no small\nmeasure to the work put in by\nthe M.C.'s who \"gave away a good\nmany spot prizes and worked extremely hard. Perhaps if as\nmuch work and imagination had\nbeen put into Saturday night\nHops, then these would be better\nattended. The selection of music\nwas good, and of special note\nmust be the rock group in the\nupper refectory.\nIn all, therefore, we cannot\ncomplain that this year's Carnival has been one which will be\nsoon forgotten. Although it will\nbe some time before the accounts\nare finally closed, it seems that\nthis year's profits are some 80 per\ncent, up on last year's., FELIX CROWDED CONDITIONS AT SILWOOD PARK\nNUMBERS UP NEXT YEAR Recently the Field Station and its inhabitants have been under\ndiscussion in union and college committees. Some details given\nhere may be informative.\nThe superficial features of Silwood can be seen on any Touchstone poster and are in some ways the best aspect of it. It is 25\nmiles from I.C. Union, on the Virginia Water to Ascot road, and\nconsists principally of the larger parts of the Botany and Zoology\npostgraduate departments crammed into Silwood house itself and\nthe smaller Ashurst Lodge nearby.\nThere is also a Meteorology botanists about to take their\ndepartment in the buildings of\nSilwood Farm ,a number of ExW.D. buildings used by visiting\nsurveying courses and for storage,\nand now the early stages of a Nuclear Reactor.\nThe root of our problems is\nthe overcrowding of the Laboratory and particularly Hostel ac-com mod ation. There are now 42\npermanent resident postgraduates\nat Silwood, compared with 27 in\n1959 and the only recent increase\nin hostel accommodation has\nbeen the recent use of of Hut 6\n(a temporary building previously\nused only in summer) which\nhouses 6 people, the remainder\nbeing \" shoe horned \" into occupied rooms in the house.\nA recent survey gives the total\nbedroom space per resident as 98\nsquare feet (18 of which is bed).\nOne room has four inhabitants\nand some are so small that the\nwardrobe and dressing table are\nkept outside. In many rooms the\nroof slopes, reducing the volume\nconsiderably.\nAccommodation for temporary\ncourses varies with the numbers\ninvolved from single rooms in\nSOUTH SIDE OPENS\nThe great day finally dawned-\u2014Saturday, May 11th, and the\ntwo East end South Side Halls opened for students. Not that the\ntwo Halls were completed\u2014carpets were still to be laid, kitchens\nand launder et tes were still not working, some rooms were deficient in lamps, bulbs, number plates, etc., but beds, water, etc., known\ncollectively as the bare essentials, were there. Some 240 students\nmoved in with their goods, chattels, and other impedimenta, those of\nus who have a tendency towards accumulating property finding the\nmove and the subsequent disposal of property rather tedious, if not\ndownright impossible. The rooms cannot be described as over-sup-plied with cupboard space, and lack of hooks on doors only serves\nto emphasise the cramped hanging space for clothes.\nVarious other small annoying\n- \u2014 \u2014 j \u2014 o details cropped up, such as the\nbookshelves which are too small\nto take anything bigger than a paper back, and suitcase storage\nspace above the fitted wardrobes,\nwhich is just too small to take\naverage size trunks, with the result that these have to be stowed\non landings. It would be petty,\nhowever, to let these small points\nobscure the fact that South Side\nwill provide, when finished, accommodation for 384 students\nwho would otherwise live in digs.\nWhether the staircase plan should\nbe followed in the other halls\nwhich will someday be built\naround Princess Gardens, is, how-ever, doubtful. Anyone who has\nexperienced communal life on the\ncorridors of Beit is immediately\nstruck by the rather more secluded and cloistered-atmosphere\n| of the solitary staircases with\ntheir rather isolated cells arranged rather in groups of fours,\ninsulated from each other by\ndouble glass doors. Perhaps\nwhen the lounges become more\npopular, there will be some more\nmixing, but at first sight, it does\nseem that the system succeeds\nrather in isolating residents than\nin throwing them together.\nThe lounges on the continuous\nservice floors are airy and\nspacious, and excellent for par-ties, as was proved at an unofficial house \\. arming that took\nplace on last Friday evening.\nAn interesting feature of the\nbuilding are the lifts, which\nshowed a tendency to stop (i.e., jam) in between levels, but this,\nlike other snags, will no doubt,\nbe ironed out in time.\nfinals, to army Nissen huts with a bed and coat hook for each man,\nfor large surveying courses. I am\nassured that the rats in these\nbuildings have left in disgust and\nthe chickens keep to their own\nsuperior accommodation nearby.\nFlats, etc., nearby are very\nscarce, and if available are used\nby married students.\nLdunge and Common Room\nspace works out at 19 square\nfeet per resident, but these facilities are used by Union members\nliving out, in the day-time, thus\nincreasing overcrowding. In our\nTV. lounge there are 22 chairs,\n18 facing the T.V \u2014thus fewer\nthan half the residents can see the\nset at a time, except by standing,\nUse of this lounge is now restricted to permanent Students\nand summer term courses from\nhuts, with furniture, for third year\nZoology and Botany depart-ment s, since Silwood is part of\nR.C.S. Union.\nComparable figures from I.C Union will probably show a worse situation, but the Silwood\nresident, who can't sit in his common room, has to resort to his\nbed, his lab, or the grass outside\nin the rain.\nThe alternative is to go out.\nLondon is 1\u00a3 hours away (7/- return fare, one bus per hour, last\none 11.30 p.m.). There are pubs\nnearby and a coffee bar (5 miles)\nand the village cinema, but even\nthe wildest spirits stay in most\nnights for lack of cash.\nIn winter the roads are dangerous to our cars, which won't start, as there is only covered\nshelter for half of them, also the\nlast buses may be cancelled without warning.\nWe have, of course, the beauty\nof the countryside to console us.\nThere is probably less loneliness\nand the food is better than at\nSouth Kensington\u2014which is just\nas well, there being no alternative\nbut the pub, the Transport Cafe\nor limited cooking facilities.\nThere will be a net increase of\nten people next year\u2014we are\nagitating for a new hostel, but\nwith scant success.\n\n"

The Mountaineering,\nCaving and Sub Aqua Clubs have\nfor some time now been looking\ninto the possibilities of acquiring\na vehicle to help them out of their\nproblems.

There\nis no high level conference, no board meeting, no top\nexecutive's^ private office into which THE TIMES is\nnot apt to be taken.\nThis choice of a newspaper by people who get on is\nindisputable.* In which of the two groups do you\nplace yourself?\nRead\nTHE TIMES\n* STUDENTS AND THE TIMES: As a student\nyou can have The Times for 2id.

Austin Van.\nWith the help of the Union, a policy was arranged which\navoided the previous insurance\ndifficulties. A personal accident\npolicy has also been arranged for\nany students who may travel in\nthe van.\nThe vehicle itself has been\nmodified with seats and luggage\nracks, and is maintained by the\nthree owner clubs. By a gentle-men's agreement, the three individuals who originally put forward the money are being paid\nback in proportion to the number of the times the vehicle is\nused by them. The initial gamble\nseems to be paying off well, and\nin a short time, the vehicle will\nbe paid for, by funds that would\notherwise have gone to some hire\nfirm for hire of Doormobiles.\nEnterprise does not finish there,\nhowever\u2014rumour has it that\nsoon the Austin may have a baby\nbrother.\nLONDON INTERNATIONAL\nSTUDENTS CLUB The full programme for the\nSummer vacation has now been\ndecided and will be as follows: \u2014\nSaturday 29th June: Reception\nand Opening Dance with a revue\npresented by Comus.\nEvery Tuesday from 2nd July\nto 5th September: Film Shows.\nEvery Thursday from 4th July\nto 7th September: Social Evenings with visiting speakers and\nfamous entertainers.\nEvery Saturday from 29th June\nto 31st August: Informal Dances\nwith cabarets by Comus.\nA buffet and bar will be available at all the evening events\nwhich are held in the Imperial\nCollege Union.\nIn addition there are weekly\ntheatre visits and a Comus production of \" The Importance of\nBeing Earnest\" on 14th18 th August. There will be weekend\ntours to places such as Windsor\nCastle, Canterbury, Stratford and\nthe Shakespeare Theatre (a two-day visit) and many others.\nThe Club is run by Students for\nthose staying in London and\nstudents from abroad who are\nworking in or just visiting\nLondon. Last year, nearly 350\nstudents from 35 different countries joined the Club, and this\nyear, as our programme is more\nvaried and ambitious, we expect\ngreater numbers of students to\njoin.\nWill YOU be here this sum-mer?

Anyone requiring\nfurther information, or wishing to\nhelp in the running of the Club\nthis summer should contact R.P. Law, Room 116 Falmouth Hall\nSouth Side).\nAND AT THE23 rd BAG . . .\n. . . He gave up of that which he\nhad eaten.\nAn abortive attempt on the\nWorld Potato Crisp Eating record\nended last Friday when ironic\ncheering indicated that the contender had not been equal to the\ntask. Four first year civil s set out\nto prove that thirty bags of crisps\ncould be eaten in less than 59\nminutes. Three dropped out\nwhen they fell behind schedule\nbut the fourth ate crisply on. He\nreached twenty bags ahead\" of\nschedule, and eating well; however by the twenty-third the\nthe colour of his face indicated\nthat his attempt was almost over,\nand when the ring of spectators\nmoved sharply backward, another\ngallant contender had fallen by\nthe wayside.\nj. m.e. DEBATE\nGUILDS MINES \u2014\nDavid Watson\nOn Tuesday last at lunch time\nsome seventy odd people assembled in the concert hall to see\nGuilds and Mines meet in verbal\nbattle over the motion \" that this\nHouse urges the immediate implementation of the proposals contained in the Beeching report\"!\nTony Berry opened for the\nproposition (Guilds) with a competent historical survey of the\ndevelopment of our railway\nsystem\u2014an account which would\nhave been all the more impressive\nif he had been able to harness\nclosely to his present end his\nundoubted mastery of fact, As it\nwas Roy Gardiner (Mines) was\nable to accept almost all that Mr.\nBerry said. The crux of the\nargument, he emphasized, was\nwhether or not to imp li ment the\nproposals now. Martin Stacey\nand David Reich spoke for\nGuilds; the former, basing his\ncase on the economic facts of life\nin the 1960's, gave his accustomed\npolished performance, while Mr.\nReich spoke competently.\nGeorge Manson, representing\nthe Celtic fringe and (incident-ally) Mines, painted a dismal\npicture of a rail less Highlands.\nNo industry, no buses, no roads,\nno railways. What were the\npeople (who apparently were not\nthere either) to do? Nigel Kelland went straight to the heart of\nthe matter\u2014' Statistics don't lie,\nonly the people who use them'\n\u2014and made some telling points.\nAlan Morden summed up for\nMines; the railways should not be\ndismantled till the real economics\nof the situation were understood.\nChris Liddle was unconvinced\u2014\nthe country could not afford to let\nthings slide any longer.\nMines won the motion and\nGuilds the debate-^a fair result.\nIt was a creditable affair for all\nconcerned, especially considering\nthe short notice at which things\nwere arranged. With a little more\nof the thrust and parry of live\ndebate, the next one will be even\nbetter.\n\n"

Maddison,\nhas done a grand job. The problem of raising more than last\nyear's total of \u00a31,125 has been tackled with the kind of initiative\nthat one would rarely expect in a College of this sort. In add i tion, the public image of the College in the eyes of the Kensington\npopulace has been carefully fostered so that next year an even\nhigher target can be aimed for.\nThe sky now seems to be the\nlimit, provided we apply as much\nimagination in future years as has\nobviously gone into this year's However, while we praise this\nyear's executive, let not be assumed that we can now sit back\nGORDON LOWE S The ideal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brornpton Arcade,\nKnightsbridge, S,W,3 KEN4494/5/6 ATLAS T!IC BEAT CEM TENNIS CLUB STOP PRESS\nAn IC sports team has finally\ndefeated CEM, partly avenging\nthe defeats suffered by the Rugger, Hockey and Golf Clubs.

Mr. Maddison himself\nis the first to point out weaknesses\nin the organisation and at this\nminute is writing a concise report\nto assist future chairmen.\nAn important aspect of this\nyear's Carnival is the amount of\nmoney collected from people outside the College. Complaints\nlevelled at our previous Carnivals have often brought out the\npoint that most of the money\ncame from students. This year,\nwhile the students did all the\nwork (e.g., pushing a four-poster\nbed to Piccadilly, and running for\nforty-eight hours around Hyde\nPark), the people in the street\nwere made to contribute hand-some ly. We were, of course, fortunate\nfor the most part with the wea-ther. This enabled a good deal\nof publicity to be effected in the\nCollege itself. The Carnival stall\nbecame a centre of life for a few\ndays, and Mr. Acker Bilk's familiar and melodious tones became\neven more familiar, if perhaps\nless melodious, as the week pro-gres sed. Saturday dawned\u2014perhaps \" exploded \" could best be\nsubstituted for \"dawned.\" The\nfloat procession appeared in\nPrince Consort Road shortly after\nnoon to the shouts, screams,\ntears and expostulations of the\nstudents, staff and Metropolitan\nPolice. These latter making\novertures to some of the former\nwith what appeared to be threats\nof cancelling the procession if it\ndidn't start on time. Obviously\nno notice was taken of this, since\nit was nearly half past twelve\nwhen the lorries finally got under\nway. The procession was; how-ever, eminently successful, raising\nnearly \u00a3250\u2014about two and a half times the amount made last\nyear.\nThe fe te in Prince's Gardens\nwas an equal success. Miss Alma\nCogan had kindly consented to\nopen it and she appeared on the\nscene, and was introduced by the\nchairman, to the cheers and yells\nof her myriad of adoring fans.\nShe was delightfully and tastefully dressed for the occasion in\na pink, flowered ensemble.\nOne notable feature this year\nwas the disappearance of the\nmarquee, but the reason for this\nwas supplied by Mr. Maddison\nwho, when criticised about it, explained that, since the weather\nwas fine, there was no need for\na tent, and had it rained, there\nwould have been nobody in the\ngardens to take shelter anyway-commendable logic. So to Saturday evening. It might be thought\nthat the successes of the procession and fe te would be difficult\nCont on page 5\n\n"

It was during\nthe last that Mr. Phillips asked\nfor a choice of cheeses in Weeks\nHall; the matter would be in-vest i gated. The Carnival Organisers were worried about the lack\nof contact between them and\nCouncil, and after some discussion Mr. Oldfield proposed that a member of Council should be\nelected to sit on the Carnival\nCommittee. Mr. White's motion\nthat the Chairman of the Carnival Committee should sit on\nCouncil was however preferred,\nand carried. This would involve\nconstitutional changes requiring\nfavourable decisions at two subsequent Union meetings.\nThe Silwood Park Committee\nare worried about the accommodation and facilities for students\nat Silwood. There would appear\nto be far too many people in too\nlittle space, and despite repeated\nrepresentation, the position seems\nto be getting worse, with more\nstudents being accepted for\ncourses there than can be conveniently accommodated. Much\nserious thought was given to the\nmatter, with the conclusion that\nsomething must and would be\ndone.\nThe most interesting report\nwas from the SCC. Mr. Pearson\ninformed Council that the Flat\nEarth Society had been carefully\nconsidered. Will it stand on its\nfeet ? Is this proposal to form\nthe Society a serious one ? Apparently the majority of Council\nbelieved that it was. We shall\nsee. . . . Also interesting was the\nformation of the Communist\nSociety. This would differ from\nthe Marxist Forum in its rather\nmore active, as opposed to theoretical work. The Marxist Forum\nwould naturally be liquidated.\nMcCarthy Gardiner suggested\nthat according to his informed\nsources, the 25 per cent, of the\nlisted members of the American\nCommunist Party were members\nof the FBI.\nFinally, Council moved on to\nAOB and the dicey question of\na fruit machine. Someone had\nwritten to Mr. Slater suggesting\nthat installation of a one-armed\nbandit in the Union would be an\nexcellent way of raising money.\n(The machine would have to be\ninstalled at above pocket height.)\nThe rules of the Union apparently forbid gambling on the\npremises, but these could presumably be changed. Mr. Phillips\nmentioned the money raising\nqualities of a fruit machine that\nhad been installed in his golf\nclub, and narrowly escaped being\nstruck by a misguided flying\nsandwich. The verdict was no,\nhowever. Still, even if there is to\nbe no gambling in the bar. a drink can't hurt\u2014the Meeting\nclosed at 7.10 p.m. HENRY MOORE IN LONDON\nBy D. Farrell\nUntil quite recently, sculpture\nhad never received any serious\nenthusiasm in England, perhaps\nbecause the preoccupation with\n\"Empire and Glory\" demanded\nwork on the Graeco Roman\npattern which combined the\nworst aspects of those two cultures to produce something best\nforgotten.\nHenry Moore is the first creative artist in England since the\nnineteenth century painters to\nachieve an international reputation and his work can be seen\nin many places in London. He\nhas an immensely powerful impact which it is difficult and\nsomewhat irritating to have to\nput into words, which at best are\na pallid, dead reflection. Of the\nhalf-dozen places where his work\ncan be seen, the Tate has perhaps the finest and most representative selection. The \" Reclining Figure,\" which was commissioned for the UNESCO\nbuilding in Paris is a good introduction to Moore's work, giving\na truer account of the total\nhuman situation than any strictly\nrealistic classical sculpture could\never achieve.\nMoore's vision is of man inextricably bound up in nature, living as part of the collective\nwhole. A tragic view of man\nalienated from himself pours out\nof the figure in two parts. A work like this would be the best\nmanifesto for the revolution\npreached by the Bishop of Woolwich.\nMoore has inspired many of\nour younger sculptors to great\nachievements, and the \" School\"\nof British Sculpture over which\nhis influence is enormous will be\nseen in Battersea Park this sum-mer. This is the first major exhibition of British sculpture since\n1949, and will be a mere 9d. bus\nride from College.\nBATTERSEA PARK\" SCULPTURE IN THE OPEN AIR\" CONTEMPORARY BRITISH AND AMERICAN WORKS\nDaily 10 a.m. till dusk. 30th May until end of Sept.\n2/6\nArt students and children - 1/-Season ticket - 7/6\nArt students and children - 2/6\nSILWOOD HOUSE BALL\nMAY31 st \u2014Applications from Union Office\nAN\nOPEN\nINVITATION\nThe idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you.
