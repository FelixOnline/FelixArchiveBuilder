This followed a narrowly\ndefeated motion to abolish the post as 'sexist and deliberately\nuninteresting'.\nBobby Joe Stein: T think it's most\nunfair.'\nThe motion was proposed by\nthe glamorous Philip Nathan,\nwho in an eloquent speech\ndenounced the competition,\nasserting that it actively discourages women from entering\nscience and technology in\ngeneral and the RCS in parti-cula r. Voting was close enough\nfor a recount to be necessary; the\nmotion was finally defeated by\ntwenty votes\" over two hundred.\nSix candidates then stood for\nthe post; four girls, Dave Watson (who stood to prove\nthat the election was not sexist)\nand Bobby Jo Stein (who stood\nto prove that it was). Mr Stein\n(in a gas mask) was duly returned to the post. His duties\nwill involve accompanying Jez\non all Rag stunts and adding\nglamour to RCS functions.\nAs part of his prize, he\nreceives a half-ticket for the\nSilwood Ball(which half?) and\ntraditionally RCS President Karl\nSchmidt must take him out to\ndinner\u2014but Mr Schmidt hopes\nthat this tradition can be\nnt in u ed.

The exchange was arranged for Tuesday, after the City\nand Guilds U GM at which\nReggie was spirited away by the\nRCS.

    "content": "Woody Allen's latest film A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy/ (AA,\nABC s) looks pretty dull from the publicity, but it turns out to be one of\nthe most subtle and funny films in recent memory.\nHaving kicked his Fellini period (Manhattan, Stardust Memories),\nhe's back to glorious colour and a fairly direct story about three couples\nspending a beautiful summer's day together. In typical Allen style all six\nhave a complex relationship and weird personal anxieties; Allen himself\nis a madcap inventor (slightly out of place in the turn of the century\nsetting) with a frigid wife played by the talented Mary Steenburgen. His\nwife's elderly cousin Leopold (Jose Ferrer) arrives at their country home\nwith his bride-to-be Ariel (the beautiful Mia Farrow). Maxwell (Tony\nRoberts) and his 'experienced' girlfriend Dulcy (Julie Hagerty) make up\nthe sextet.\nBy a series of complex twists Allen lampoons romance, marriage,\nphilosophy (as ever) and, of course, sex. The film is by no means a 'knee\nslap per' and does not have the pace of Annie Hall, but it is certainly a very enjoyable and entertaining piece. Allen's wisecracks come thick\nand fast and the beautiful filming, coupled with Mendelssohn' s atmospheric score, is a real bonus.\nI was very glad that Allen has chosen to move forward with a subtle,\nclever comedy which is not just a remake of his greatest hit, Annie Hall.\nCatch this one if you can.\nEj Q J IP tieN T SA^LC OF SPHMCTB\n^ .*\u00bb\u00abW* START/NG\nMONCAY ll fi OCT066R. \u2014 \" W6T0C K.S CAST gt MAX* THC \u00ab\u00bb\u00abn if \u00ab\u00bb|il.

Happy New Year.\nThe Committee\nLOOKSEE\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nNeapolitan Art\nWhy is it that October, with the start of the\nnew academic year, should be far more a month of beginnings and of good resolutions\nthan January ever is? A fresh crop of fresher s(!), in smart, dark jeans and neat haircuts must\nhave something to do with it. But even when\nthe chaos of Freshers' Week and unfamiliar\ntimetables has subsided, the crisp autumn\ndays that come between the drizzle and\ndownpour seem far more en vigo rating, mentally, than a biting wind on New Year's Day. Autumn is also the time that the galleries\nget into a higher gear again, after a somnolent\nsummer, and the new season's major\nexhibitions open. So I 've paid a visit to the\nRoyal Academy of Arts to see the exhibition\n'Painting in Naples, 1606-1705', which started\non October 2.\nIt's quite a large exhibition, over 150\npaintings, dating from the arrival of Caravaggio\nin Naples in 1606, to the end of Luca\nGiordano's career in 1705.\nOpening up Britain; our program for this term:\nOct 15-17 Peak District (Derbyshire); Oct 29-31 Lulworth (Dorset); Nov 12-14 Quantock\nHills; Nov 26-28 Snowdonia; Dec 10-12\nYorkshire Dales.

The post are really just\nto help in organizing future social events, so if\nanyone is interested please come along.\nIf anyone is interested in organizing\nthe plough mans lunch, wants a chat, is lost, I can be contacted through the Union Office.\nBye for now.\nJohn Passmore\nreviews: I find Italian history incredibly complex, so\nresorted to an old schoolbook for the historical\nbackground to the Neapolitan school of\npainting. Italy had been part of the Holy\nRoman Empire since 1530 and in 1559 fell by\ntreaty to the Spanish branch of the Hapsburgs.\nAs such the Kingdom of Naples was controlled\nby strong Spanish garrisons and ruled by\nviceroys who imposed crushing taxation. The\ncity of Naples, with its large port, was the\nadministrative capital and a centre of banking\nand trade. No doubt the commercial sucess\nand the huge gap between rich and poor,\nfinanced the opulent viceroy's court, the\nbuilding of churches and palaces and their\ndecoration with works of art by the most\nfamous contemporary artists. The bulk of the\nRoyal Academy exhibition is of these\npaintings\u2014vast, magnificent and totally\nun liveable with.\nThe starting point is Michelangelo Merisi da\nCaravaggio, and his influence on the\nNeapolitan painters of the 17th century can be\ntraced throughout the exhibition. He reacted\nagainst the convention that biblical stories\nshould be enacted by handsome/beautiful\npeople: he introduced stark realism, and in his\n'Crucifixion of St. Andrew' the saint is a withered, weather-beaten old man. His\npictures are violent, often brutal, yet with the\nodd flash of gentleness and sensitivity. But,\nmaybe, his most impressive effect is that of\n'chiaroscuro'\u2014the harsh contrast between\nspot lit figures and inky shadows, which seems\nC&G Union\nCity and Guilds Union will be holding their\nFreshers' Dinners on the following days:\nThurs Oct 14 Elec Eng; Mon Oct 18 Chem\nEng; Thurs Oct 21 Computing; Mon Oct 25\nCiv Eng; Mon Nov 1 Mech Eng and Man Sci\nand Thurs Nov 4 Aero.\nThe cost to second and third years will be\n\u00a37.50 which is sub sidi sed by the Union.

There will probably be trips to Jodrell\nBank so keep your eyes on all the noticeboards for details; see you Tuesday I hope.\nall the more intense for the surrounding areas\nof pitch darkness.\nPainters from all over Europe, who visited\nNaples early in the century, also influenced the\nlocal artists and softened the drama and\nrealism of Caravaggio's followers. The warm\ncolours, and the exuberant painting\ntechnique, of Reubens' 'Feast of Herod' can be\nseen in Luca Giordano's pictures. Here, the\ncolours come straight off an iced birthday cake\nand the restless style is appealing rather than\ndisturbing.\nBy contrast, Gallery V is concerned with still\nlife painting: Neapolitan artists were amongst\nthe first to explore the possibilities of a picture\ntotally without figures. There are some superb\narrangements of gaudy, overblown flowers and\nsucculent fruits, just asking to be eaten!\nSmall scale pictures, for private collectors,\nwere also made in Naples. The Small South\nRoom is devoted to those by Cavallino, which\nare comparatively light and fresh, and are full\nof young, pretty (and very foolish looking!)\nsaints and singers.\nOn the whole the exhibition is rich and\ngrand, rather than sympathetic\u2014but then so\ntoo were the pictures' original settings and so\ntoo is Burlington House, which is probably\nworth a visit in its own right!\nPainting in Naples 1606-1705 is at the Royal\nAcademy, Burlington House, Piccadilly, WJ. till\nDecember 12. It is open daily (including\nweekends) from 10:00am to 6:00pm. Full\nadmission \u00a32.50, students etc \u00a31.60.\nFELIX Il October8.19821| Pug e9 "

    "content": "A new pressure group has been formed to oppose the\ngovernment's education funding. Simon Rodan, the Union's External Affiars Officer, and Steve Goulder, the President, explain\nwhy it deserves our support.\nEducational Alliance On Wednesday October 13, the Educational Alliance, in conjunction\nwith the University of London Union, is staging a rally. Its purpose is to\ntry to focus media attention on the ludicrous nature of the Department\nof Education and Science's current attempts at cutting back\nexpenditure in education.\nThe Educational Alliance was\nformed this year in a concerted\nattempt by various groups\ninvolved in the field of education\nto call to a halt the severe scaling\ndown that is at present being\nimplemented. The Alliance represents University teaching\nstaff, students, and all non-academic staff employed by the\nuniversities as well as involving\nteachers and parent-teacher\norganisations from secondary\neducation. Clearly, it is not just\none part of the system that is\nobjecting, but everybody involved in a unanimous rejection\nof current DES policy.\nSome examples of the anomalies in the present round of cuts\nshow the lack of long term\nthought that has gone into the\npolicy making so far. Salford\nand Aston are two technological\nuniversities which are turning\nout science and engineering\ngraduates who are the top\npriority requirement of the\nmanufacturing industries. Both\nhave suffered enormous cuts\nwhile other institutions, Oxford,\nCambridge and Bristol spring\nreadily to mind, which have very\nsmaller fractions of science and\nengineering graduates have not\nsuffered at all.\nThus, in ten years hence there\nwill probably be, as a direct\nresult, a shortage of qualified\nprofessional technologists which\ncan only be detrimental to the\ncountry' s economy and industrial base.\nAnother example nearer home\ncould be drawn from the drastic\nreorganisation being brought\nabout within the University of\nLondon as a consequence of the\nshortage of funds. QE C to avoid\ncomplete closure has had to seek\nmerges with other London colleges, notably our own, last\nyear and this year, with Kings\nCollege and Chelsea College.\nBedford is another smaller\nLondon college which faces\nclosure unless they can complete\na deal within the University of\nLondon to split itself amongst\nseveral other colleges.\nFull cost fees for overseas\nstudents is yet another contentious issue. Fewer students can\nnow afford to study in this\ncountry if they come from\nabroad. This restricts the foreign\nstudents to those who have\ngovernment or industrial sponsorship plus the handful of\nothers who can afford to pay the\nenormous fees bill.\nFor example it is now cheaper\nfor foreign students to study at\nprestigious American institutes\nsuch as the California Institute\nof Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nBerkley and others than for\nthem to come for example to\nImperial. While previously this\nwas not the case, we attracted a large number of highly talented\nstudents from abroad which in\nturn strengthened the universities here. Now these students\nwill be looking elsewhere for\nopportunities in higher education and we will loose a valuable\ncontribution to the academic\nworld. This has wider implications in the industrial sector. A large proportion of foreign\nstudents coming from the\ndeveloping countries to universities in both America and\nBritain go back to their home\ncountries to take up, or very\nlikely end up in, important\ngovernment advisory posit o in s or highly placed in industry.\nTrends indicate clearly that\nthose ex-students will be strongly\nbiased towards placing any\nindustrial or equipment orders\nwith firms in the country in\nwhich they studied. Hence by\nloosing a large number of\nforeign students we will in the\nlong term be adversely affecting\nour export market to these\ndeveloping countries.\nLosing foreign students has\nother repercussions such as on\nthe School of Hygiene and\nTropical Medicine and the\nPostgraduate Medical School,\nboth of which take a very high\nproportion of for ie gn students\neach year.\nCuts in the secondary education system have been as severe\nas in higher education. Schools\nare having to operate on shoestring budgets, with fewer\nteaching staff hence higher pupil\nteacher ratios, and almost no\nmoney for renewing antiquated\nequipment.\nWhile mandatory grants\nremain conditional on the offer\nof a university place, discretionary grants for courses\nsuch as physiotherapy, and\nspeech therapy are becoming\nmore difficult to obtain.\nAnd of course there is the\nhardship of redundancies as\ninstitutions are trimmed or\nclosed, still further increasing\nthe number out of work.\nI have tried to outline the\nproblems the Educational Alliance is trying to combat by\ninsisting on a halt to the\ndecimation of our education\nsystem, brought about in this ill-conceived and haphazard fa-shi on. The rally on Wednesday\nis important, probably the most\nimportant this year. While it\nmay all seem a little strange to\nsome of the fresher s, it is above\nall to them to whom this article\nis addressed. The Alliance needs\nyour support'and above all your\nparticipation. It really is in your\nhands, for decisions on policy\ntaken this year may have far\nreaching, long term effects.

However, because of lack of publicity the meeting was\nobviously in quo rate from the start.\nAlthough no policy was made\nthe meeting was useful in that it\naccepted the ratification of a large number of elections at\nprevious UG Ms. Several other\nposts were also filled; Jon Stanley was ratified as External\nAffairs Committee Secretary, P Simion as ordinary member of\nthe Permanent Working Party\nand Christine Teller and Peter\nBurt as delegates to the University of London Union General\nUnion Council.\nThis business was transacted\nduring Mary Freeman's report\nas returning officer with a minimum of trouble, as was\nStephen Goulder's report as\nPresident and Miss Freeman's report as Honorary Secretary.\nHowever the meeting was closed\nduring Miss Freeman's third\nvisit to the microphone during\nthe motion on the changes to the\nvoting schedule.

Jon\nStanley opposed the motion on\nthe grounds that the schedule\nwas clear and correct and any\nconfusion was caused by wool i ness on behalf of the returning\nNo. 622 HB HH BH HH officer. During questions Miss\nFreeman stated that the amendments had been approved by the\nElectoral Reform Society.\nProcedural motions were then\nput to refer the motion either to\nthe next U GM or the Permanent\nWorking Party but before this\nwas decided quorum was called\nby Miss Caroline Scott of Elec\nEng 1 and the meeting closed at\n2:17pm. WIST DRIVE FAILS\nAn attempt to clamp down on\noffensive advertising material in\nCollege failed yesterday when the\nUnion General Meeting was\ndeclared in quo rate. A motion was to have been\nproposed .by a representative of\nWomen in Science and Technology (WIST), the women's rights group, after the publication of an allegedly offensive\ncover on Guildsheet, the City\nand Guilds Union magazine. In\naddition, complaints had been\nmade about a poster advertising\nthe HG Wells Society. The\nmotion suggested that on receipt\nof a petition signed by twenty or\nmore Union members, the\nHouse Committee should con\nsidera complaint concerning\nany offensive poster. If this\ncomplaint were to be upheld, the\noffending society would be\nfined, and after two offences\npermission for that society to\ndisplay posters would be with-drawn.\nAt present any posters for\ndisplay may only be put up with\nthe permission of the Union Publicity Officer or the Honorary Secretary. In the past,\nhowever, permission has been\nreasonably automatic, subject to\nthe Publicity Rules.\nIn the proposed amendment,\nMary Freeman was going to\ndraw attention to several posters\nwhich had been found offensive\nby certain groups at college.\nAlthough officials of Wellsoc\nwere considering making a formal apology at the U GM, it\nwas declared in quo rate before\nthis was possible. The motion is\nexpected to come up at the next\nquo rate U GM. WHO'S A PRiTTV BW TH\u20acN? "

    "content": "Winking Off The Welfare Officer at Freshers'\nFair demonstrates a new type of\ncontraceptive.\nWelsh Letter\nImperial College Union has\nreceived a communication in\nWelsh from the students union\nof the University of Aberystwyth.\nThe letter (fortunately with a translation enclosed) informed\nhim that the Aberystwyth Students' Union is considering\nd is affiliating from the National\nUnion of Students. As IC is one\nof the few colleges outside Scotland not to be connected with\nthe NUS, they are seeking advice\nand encouragement.\nStephen Goulder, ICU President, said that he was flattered\nby their enquiry and would reply\nas soon as he had mastered the\nlanguage.\nBalancing\nthe Books\nStudents could soon be charged\nfor use of the Science Museum\nLibrary in Imperial College\nRoad. This follows a recommendation in the Rayner Report on\nrational is ation of the civil service.\nAt present the library is open\nto all postgraduate students and\nresearch assistants, and in some\ncases to third year under graduates. A levy of thirty pence\non each book issued is now\nplanned and there could be a reduction in the number of\nperiodicals kept in stock.\nUnion President Steve\nGoulder and External Affairs\nOfficer Simon Rodan have\nofficially protested that they\nwere not notified of the planned\nchanges, which are totally unacceptable to the Union. Mr Goulder described the plans as\nan act of gross ingratitude on the\npart of the library, which already\nhas all rent, heating and lighting\npaid by the College.\nThe Rag Tiddlywinks stunt has\nbeen postponed until next\nSaturday because of possible\npolice intervention over licensing\nlaws.\nTraditionally, IC students\nhave always tid d ly winked along\nOxford Street on the first\nSaturday of term; this has\nalways been considered the\nFreshers' Rag Stunt. But after\nlast year's controversy over\nstreet collecting licenses, Scotland Yard informed the Union\nthat if they went ahead on\nSaturday they would be prose-cute d, despite the Multiple Scelerosis Society withdrawing\ntheir complaint after the Rag\nCommittee had offered to collect\nfor MS funds.\nSeveral attempts to find a way\naround the law were made, but\nall of them failed. The most\noriginal of these was that\ntid d ly winking down Oxford Street had been done since 1968,\nand was therefore a folk tradition\nand exempt from the regulations.\nThe Metropolitan Police wrote\nback enclosing a copy of the\nMiscellaneous Provisions Act of\n1916 (section 5, regulation 3(1),\nschedule 2) which imposes a minimum precedent of thirty\nyears on folk traditions.\nAt a meeting of the Union\nExecutive last week, it was\ndecided to proceed in defiance of\nthe police, but along Kings Road\nto avoid the waiting constabulary\nin Oxford Street. King's Road is\nLondon's second busiest shopping street and, a collection in\nexcess of \u00a31,000 for charity was\nexpected. But at a further meeting on Wednesday, it was\nrevealed that Men cap( the\nsociety for the mentally hand i capped) had licences which\nwould allow the Union to collect\nfor them on the following Saturday, and so the committee\nagreed that under the circumstances it would be wiser to\npostpone the event until Saturday\nweek.\nAs an alternative Rag stunt\nfor tomorrow, the R CSU will be\nselling Rag Mags at the University of Kent in Canterbury, leaving Beit Arch at 9:30am. All Work\nand\nNo Play\nStudents in the department of\nManagement Science have been\nprevented from attending introductory events organised by the\nCollege and Union. The department have organised formal\nclasses for the first Moniiay and\nTuesday of term and, there are\nalso classes timetabled for\nWednesday afternoon which clash\nwith sports club trials.\nThis action was taken despite\nan agreement between the Board\nof Studies and the Union that no\nclasses be organised for the first\nMonday and Tuesday of term\nand that Wednesday afternoons\nshould be left free for students to\nparticipate in the sports and\nrecreational clubs.\nThe head of the Management\nScience department, Professor\nEilon refused to comment and\nsuggested that any queries\ninvolving timetabling should be\naddressed to the College Registrar.\nNew Refectory \u2014 Whining and Dining\nFELIXI\nSimon Perry, Refectory Committee Chairman Bob Schroter, and\nDeputy Catering Manager Martin Parsons agree there are too few\nchairs (or too many tables) in the new refectory.\n1 ^ \u2014 \u2022 October8,\\9^ WSSBBBBBBBSBM\nThe new Union Lounge bar\nopened on Monday to a varied\nreception from staff and students\nalike.\nAs foreseen, there have been\nsome teething problems. Refectory staff have complained that\nthe kitchens are excessively hot\nand students have complained\nthat the food is not. Other\ncomplaints have mostly concerned quality of the hot meals,\nwhich seems to have deteriorated\nsince Monday; the procedure of\ncooking food in the Sherfield\nRefectory and re-heating it in the\nnew kitchens does not appear to\nwork.\nThe salads and plough man's lunches have proved most\npopular, and approach the\nstandards of those served in the\nRoyal College of Art refectory,\nwhile being rather cheaper. The\nrolls from behind the bar are still\ngenerally all sold by 1:30pm. Refectory Committee Chairman Dr Bob Schroter's initial\nreaction was very favourable.\nThe fittings and decor have been\ncriticised because the rooms\nlooks as if building was finished\nin a hurry, which it was. The\nbare painted walls need posters\nor other decoration, and there is\nno clock. In general the new\nservice is acceptable but not\ni spectacular.\n\u2014 \u2014 | Pug e3 "

    "content": "A Fair Fight\nThere was an angry scene at\nFresher s' Fair on Tuesday when the Jewish and Islamic\nSocieties found themselves\noccupying adjacent stalls,\nfollowing a reshuffle.\nThe mix-up was caused when\nRobin Graham, chairman of\nboth Vegetarian and Jewish\nsocieties, suggested that the two\nstalls change places so that\nVegsoc would have access to an\nelectric socket.\nNeither society was deterred\nfrom displaying strongly political posters, and Social\nClubs Committee Chairman\nJonathan Miller was called in\nto arbitrate in the ensuing\nshouting match. As an ex-chairman of Jewish Society\nhimself, this was impossible,\nand Union officials were forced\nto remove posters from both\nstalls before peace was restored.\nUnion President Stephen\nGoulder criticised both societies\nfor their conduct and claimed\nthat religious societies should\nnot display political posters,\nbut that putting the two\nsocieties in the same room at\nall was in retrospect rather\nfoolish.
