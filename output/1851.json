Early mornings and late eve-nings; trying to squeeze out droplets of fun from a\nmind-numbing yet mandatory curriculum; having to\nstop periodically because one of the thirty-or-so kids\nin class has attempted to stab their neighbour with a\ncompass;markingduringbreaktimes,andlunchtimes,\nand all other times \u2013 the list goes on, ad nauseam. Even\nits premise, that one teacher can get an entire room of\nattention-deficient teenagers to be remotely enthused\nabout a subject so that they can then pass a series of\nseemingly arbitrary exams, seems overwhelming.\nIf there\u2019s one thing that German-language drama\nThe Teachers\u2019 Lounge (2023) excels at, it\u2019s putting these\nhardships front and centre. Seventh-grade teacher\nCarla Nowak (Leonie Benesch) has to juggle a class of\npubescent children and their morphing attitudes to\nauthority, their demanding parents, and an administration which fails to solve endemic problems within\nthe school.\nBut it is the titular lounge where many of Nowak\u2019s\nproblems can be traced back to. Her relative inexperience and energy clashes with her colleagues\u2019 disil-lusionment: as a result, interactions with them are\nlaced with simmering hostility, and she becomes more\nguarded in their vicinity. Things come to a head when\nthe school secretary Friederike Kuhn (Eva L\u00f6bau) is\naccused of a series of thefts from various teachers, including Nowak. Her son Oskar, irate at the bureaucratic responses from school staff, begins to act out more\nand more in Nowak\u2019s classes.\nMovies about education tend to mirror the high\nstandards of professionalism demanded of teachers in\nreal life: depicting them as moral paragons, consistently cordial with one another and only ever disagreeing on topics of classroom technique. Bad news for morals police everywhere \u2013 people get annoyed, prejudge,\nand gossip. In his portrayal of Nowak\u2019s fellow teachers,\ndirector \u0130lker \u00c7atak manages to reflect these inescapable truths without making the characters seem too\nobnoxious. Ditto for the children, who throughout the\nmovie seem to yearn to be older \u2013 from Jieun and Luise\nsneaking outside with a lighter for \u201cfresh air,\u201d to the\nentire class making a stand against Nowak for infan-tilising them.\nThe only character, really, who falls short is the protagonist herself. Benesch\u2019s wonderful and fitting expressivity doesn\u2019t change the fact that her character\nmartyrs herself to a degree that transcends the realm\nof admirable, and enters the realm of exasperating.\nWhen Nowak consents to an interview with the school\npaper and is subject to an interrogation by student\njournos about the Kuhn proceedings, one can\u2019t help\nbut feel as if she is one of the people digging her grave.\nEven when Oskar breaks into the lounge, steals her lap-top, and assaults her during his getaway, Nowak predictably defends him from suspension.\nAll in all, The Teachers\u2019 Lounge joins others like The\nClass (2008) in being a close look into education in the\n21st century. Teaching, as always, is difficult and un-glamorised, and \u00c7atak accurately, if overstatedly, represents the issues that face modern teachers today.\nThe Teachers\u2019\nLounge\nFILM\nHere\u2019s a movie that\u2019ll\nmake you never want to\ngo into education.\nFilmEditor\nTARUN NAIR\nMovies about education tend\nto mirror the high standards of\nprofessionalism demanded of\nteachers in real life\n\u201c\nReach out at felix@ic.ac.uk!\nReach out at felix@ic.ac.uk!\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | CULTURE 27 september 2024\nA\ns the new Culture Section Editor, I would like to\ncordially welcome all the freshers joining Imperial\nthis year. And as for the returning students, welcome back.\nAssuming you have already completed the rather\nharrowing beginning-of-uni shop, where you realised\njust how much staying alive costs, it is safe to say that by\nnow you have realised that London is Huge, sprawling\nover six zones in all directions. This lovely city, of which\nyou are now a resident, is home to many things: gigantic museums, dastardly landlords, lovely art galleries,\novercrowded pubs, and more. What I am getting at, dear\nreader, is that London is a city of many faces. It offers\njust about everything one can ask for, except cheap\nprices: hence it is natural to feel overcome by the sheer\nnumber of places to visit and things to do.\nLucky for you, this section aims to help you with just\nthat problem. The Culture section is a new addition to\nFelix and is the lovechild of two of our now dearly departed sections, Arts (concerning all things artistic, visual,\nand dramatic) and Music (concerning all things musical\nfrom classical to contemporary). Here, you can expect to\nread just about anything under the Arts and Music umbrella \u2013 architecture guides, commentary on plays, reviews of galleries, album reviews, and overviews of the\ndifferent places you can visit. Now, some might be asking why such a section is needed for a STEM university;\nsurely the topics of Science, Business, and Investment\nwould be better material for our scientifically minded\npeers to consume. To that I reply with a resolute No.\nAs the often-belated realisation that one cannot live\noff Tesco meal deals forever and must learn how to cook\nthings with actual nutritional value demonstrates, life\nis about balance. Just as only consuming crisps and coffee is not the best thing for your physical health, only\nexposing oneself to a singular subject, without challenging yourself in others is harmful in the long run.\nBalance is a key element in ensuring your life is one you\ncan look back on happily.\nSimilarly, a life spent running away from any possible expansion of one\u2019s artistic horizons is a rather drab\none, and we can certainly do better than that. Without\nsounding too stuck-up, art is a part of our lives that we\nsimply cannot ignore. As a society, we rely on the arts\nas one of the foundations of our culture, without which\nlife would be boring and dull. If I haven\u2019t managed to\nconvince the naysayers yet, I will say one last thing: Imperial itself invests quite a bit of money to ensure its students can have access to affordable tickets to see plays\nand galleries. To the freshers reading this, your accommodations will also be arranging cheap tickets for you\nthroughout the academic year as well.\nYet, what is one to do when dropped into an ocean of\npossibilities without being first taught how to swim? The\nArts pose a rather daunting prospect for newcomers, at\nleast partially due to the pseudo-intellectualism of an\nunfortunate number of its enjoyers. The thoughts of not\n\u201cgetting\u201d the meaning, being confused by the frenzy of\nLatin, Greek, and Italian vocabulary, and not knowing\nwho is \u201cin\u201d are all distressing enough by themselves \u2013 to-gether, they are enough to discourage one altogether.\nPlease feel free to look to this section as a sort of map,\nshowing the many different aspects of Arts and Music.\nAnd much like any good map, it\u2019s not about pointing\nout just one route but about laying out a landscape full\nof possible paths for you to explore. Maybe you\u2019ll take\nthe scenic route through modern art, or perhaps you\u2019ll\nfollow the winding trail of indie music reviews. There\u2019s\nno right or wrong direction; the idea is to find your own\nway and discover what resonates with you. This is not\nintended to be a compass, telling you what to and not to\nlike; writers are free to write their own opinion, and you,\nreader, are free to disagree with it. This section offers to\nyou a goldmine of ideas of what to see and explore next\n\u2013 at least, that\u2019s the goal!\nWelcome (and an intro) to the\nCulture Section!\nCULTURE\nCultureEditor\nELIF CIVELEKOGLU\nA not-so-brief introduction to the new section\nof Felix \u2013 the lovechild of two of our dearly\ndeparted\nStudents enjoying music Rolando Charles\n\n"

Despite the\nrather gloomy weather, it both keeps art alive \u2013 be\nit through its various galleries, the multitude of\nWest End shows, and its opera houses \u2013 but also fosters it. There are many hotspots in London, containing\neverything between street caricaturists and Banksy. Yet,\nas previously discussed, the sheer magnitude of possibilities is overwhelming, especially if you are new to the\ncity.\nFret not, dear readers, as this article\u2019s sole aim is to\nshow you possible places you can start off with. Without\nfurther ado, here is a list of places you can visit:\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nStarting off strong with the Imperial student\u2019s best\nfriend, this lovely museum is located a short 10-minute\nwalk away from our South Kensington Campus. A highlight of my academic life is to go here between lessons\nto decompress \u2013 this museum is large enough that with\neach visit, you can see a new section. They also have a\nfree library for students, which is nothing short of pic-turesque.\nThe National Gallery\nThis London landmark, located in the bustling Trafalgar Square, contains one of the UK\u2019s largest collections\nof international art. It\u2019s perfect for those looking to dip\ntheir toes into the world of art, containing a piece of just\nabout every era within it. Showcasing the works of Van\nGogh, Monet, and Da Vinci, it\u2019s no wonder that this museum is never void of visitors. Small tip from the editor:\navoid coming here between 4 and 6pm, when it\u2019s at its\nbusiest!\nRoyal Opera House (ROH)\nLocated in Covent Garden, this is one of the most famous opera houses in the world. Home to the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet, and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, this historic masterpiece offers some of the\nhighest quality productions of opera and ballet one can\nsee. Not resting on its laurels, it offers both contemporary and traditional shows all year round. Lastly, it offers\na discount on tickets for 16\u201325 year olds, which you can\nsign up for online in their website. A must see for every\nstudent in London for sure!\nSouthbank Centre\nSouthbank Centre is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, while\nnot sacrificing on quality. Located rather obviously in\nSouth Bank, it is a hub for all kinds of music and art in\ntrue London fashion, hosting 5000 different events a\nyear. They have four(!!!) resident orchestras, including\nmy favourite, London Philharmonic Orchestra. Lastly,\nthey feature iconic festivals, like the London Jazz Festival, the London Literature Festival, and the summer festival Meltdown.\nMarylebone\nMarylebone, located just north of Hyde Park, is one of\nthe most beautiful areas in perhaps all of London \u2013 a\nmust see for sure, especially in the autumn. It contains\nmany centres that uphold London\u2019s legacy as a centre\nfor culture and the arts, such as the Wallace Collection,\nwhich displays art from the 18th and 19th centuries. Not\nonly is the art lovely, but the building itself is noteworthy as a standalone: it is a 19th century mansion. The\nWigmore Hall, one of London\u2019s important concert venues for classical music, is another landmark. It also features an under 35s scheme, offering \u00a35 tickets for select\nconcerts.\nCity of London (yes, all of it)\nIf you are a free soul and fancy a nice walk, nothing\nwould be better than a simple walk around the City of\nLondon. To clarify, the City refers to the historic financial district within London, with boundaries stretching\nfrom Chancery Lane in the east to Liverpool Street in the\nwest. The City, despite its small size, offers a goldmine\nof landmarks. The architecture alone is breath-taking\nenough that you can just walk through it while admiring the buildings; St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and Guildhall are\ntwo of my recommendations.\nThe Three Graces by Antonio Canova at the V&A Elif Civelekoglu\nCultureEditor\nELIF CIVELEKOGLU\n\n"

Only the library caf\u00e9 is open late\nin the evening, to serve coffee or any of\nthe packaged food. During the week,\nthe Library and City & Guilds Caf\u00e9\nsells delicious hot meat and vegetarian\nlunches.\nFor lunch, Sherfield becomes crowded\nwith students buying pizza from Neo\nPizza, vegan food from Plantworks,\nJapanese curry from Kimiko, and other\nwarm meals from Feast and the SCR\ncafeteria.

Hence, it\nis best to get used to carrying a reusable\ncoffee cup and a water bottle, as water\nstations are placed all around campus.\nSingle-use cutlery at restaurants is only\navailable for paying staff and students.\nOn campus, everything is paid by\ncard, and student discounts are offered\nby tapping a valid student ID card on the\nlittle black reader. More discounts and\nrewards are available with Yoyo Wallet, a\nloyalty app used around campus.\nThe Convenience Store\nSnacks are most affordable at the grocery\nstore. However, for convenience, the\nstore on the Sherfield Walkway across\nthe Union merchandise store (open from\n9 am to 5 pm) offers fruits, sandwiches,\ndrinks, chocolate, chips, energy bars, and\na wide variety of mochi ice creams and\nAsian snacks. They also sell stationery\nand basic sanitation items, medicine,\nand cables.\nStudents will also spot many vending\nmachines with sodas, chips, oat bars,\nand protein bars stocked inside. Modern\nmachines use a weight-sensing system\nto detect the removal of any items after\nopening the front door. To open the\ndoor, a \u00a35 deposit will be charged to the\nstudent\u2019s bank account.

For\nfreshers, this could mean mustering\nup the courage to say hello to everyone you\npass by on campus, or experimenting with\nyour style to find something that make you\nmore you. Back in my day, I started growing a beard, which turned out to be a good\nway to not look sixteen anymore. For sec-ond-years, first steps could be to sign up\nto different clubs or societies (Felix for ex-ample) or asking out your long-time crush\nfrom halls. Unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t know\nwhat to recommend for third-years be-cause, well, that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to\nfind out myself very soon.\nEvery year there are new first steps to\nbe taken, at university and in life. A lot of\nthe time they are intimidating, but more\noften than not they mark the beginning of\nsomething that could last a season, or maybe a whole lifetime. In the most clich\u00e9 way\npossible: you have to start somewhere, and\ncommunicating that idea in photography is\nan interesting challenge and no easy task.\nTobeperfectlycandid,Iusuallyneverread\nthe \u2018comment\u2019 part of the photo submission\nform until after I\u2019ve looked through all the\nphotos and decided the week\u2019s winner. It\u2019s\nimportant to get a bit of context as to what\nI\u2019m looking at, but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t sway me or\nbring meaning to the photos. This time,\ncontext is everything. Charlotte presents an\nunorthodox medley of shapes painted on\na textured, monochromatic background.\nAmongst the shoeprints in the sand, small\npaws trod alongside their owners. What\nshe writes is poetic: \u201c[The picture] was\ntaken [...] on a beach in Canet, France. We\nknow [that] many retired couples live here\nwith their dogs. Few young people vacation\nhere. Mostly adults come with their young\nchildren to visit their grandparents\u201d.\nWhat a beautiful story this picture tells, an\nintuition about generational continuation,\nfamily, loved ones, and their furry friends.\nCharlotte paints a smile on my face as I\nscrutinise her photo. I too would love to\ntake a few first steps on some sandy beach\nin France.\nFinally, it could not be a photography section article without making a point on some\ngrand aspect of our lives. To such avail,\nI invite you to study Walt\u2019s mesmerising\nnight sky. A jubilee of technical know-how\n(anyone who has tried astro-photography\nbefore will confirm this), and an invite to\ncontemplate something greater than our-selves.

We\u2019ve\nseen Brat summer come and go,\nrace riots in the UK (that was a fun\nweek commuting to my office in the\nbowels of Beit Quad) and a host of\npolicies being introduced that might\naffect students, such as new sexual\nmisconduct guidelines introduced\nby the Office for Students, a Renters\nReform bill that will grant greater\nrights to tenants (apart from students\nin halls) being introduced, a ban on\noutdoor smoking, and universities\nbeing thrown to the wolves as a\nfunding crisis grips the sector. But\ndespite the doom and gloom of\ngenerally existing in the UK, Felix is\nso back.\nI\u2019m both excited and aware of the\nimmense responsibility I have as the\nEditor-in-Chief, not only getting my\ndream job at the tender age of 21, but\nalso because as Imperial College\u2019s\nnewspaper of note, for students and\nstaff alike, Felix has a duty to report on\nall the things of note going on at the\nCollege for both students and staff.\nFelix last year was brilliant, with some\namazing stories that even breached\nthe divide between a student\nnewspaper and the national press,\nand I\u2019m aiming to continue that vein\nof high quality of reporting that my\npredecessor Jamie John maintained. I\nwould also like to dedicate my thanks\nto Zanna Buckland and Mike Buzadji,\nlast year\u2019s Deputy Editor-in-Chief and\nChair for running such a tight ship,\nmodernising our design, and for their\nexcellence in Keeping the Cat Free.\nFelix is always looking for\nfresh blood to join us. It\u2019s a great\nentry into a career in journalism\n\u2013 we\u2019ve had previous editors and\ncontributors move into careers for\nThe Guardian, the Financial Times,\nand The Economist, to name a few\npublications. We rely on students\nto run and publish throughout the\nyear. Anyone at Imperial can submit\nan article for publication, be that\nstudent, staff, or alum, and we aim to\npublish as much as we can, provided\nit\u2019s not someone\u2019s insane ramblings\n(we still might publish that \u2013 I mean\nmy editorials are published weekly).\nBeing an established writer doesn\u2019t\nmatter \u2013 none of us already working\nin the office are particularly literate\nand we\u2019re all STEM meaning we can\u2019t\ncommunicate effectively for shit. Felix\nis also editorially independent, and\nwe intend to keep it that way so we\ncan maintain our high standards of\nreportage. You don\u2019t even have to\nwrite for us, we\u2019re always looking for\nillustrators, copyeditors, and graphic\ndesigners, so if you\u2019re interested,\nshoot us a message at felix@ic.ac.uk.\nYou can also keep track of\nthe latest dealings on Imperial\u2019s\ncampuses through our Instagram\n(@felix_imperial) and through the\nweekly newsletter The Lowdown \u2013\nsee across for the QR code to join.\nOur papers are distributed across\nSouth Kensington for all 12 print\nreaders. If you\u2019d like to meet the\nteam and consider getting involved,\nwe\u2019ll be around at the Welcome Fair\non Tuesday 1st October \u2013 we have\nstickers.\nLastly, I want to thank my team\nfor their support in getting out the\nfirst issue and all the background\nwork we\u2019ve done. A huge thanks to\nCharlotte Probstel, the Chair whose\namazing organisation and dedication\nhas ensured our editors are ready\nto go. Thanks to Tarun Nair, chief\ncopyeditor, who along with my deputy\nTaylor Pomfret, have developed\nour style guide, which is essential\nonboarding for a lot of our editors who\nhave just started. Also, before I forget,\nthanks to Ruby Lydford for designing\nour back cover , I believe the kids\nsay \"we stan a talented queen\". I\nwould also like to thank everyone for\nbeing so enthusiastic about starting\nanother year at the office, because\nultimately, without my team of editors\nthere would be no Felix.\nAs you do x,\nMohammad Majlisi Felix Editor\n23rd\nSeptember 2024\nEDITORIAL\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nVACANCIES\nWe\u2019re always looking for fresh\nblood!

Welcome to Imperial! I\u2019m Steph, HongKong born and raised, a foodie with allergies,\nand parent to 18 plushies.\nOnce upon a time (five years ago), I left home for the\nfirst time and moved to London to begin my university\njourney at Imperial as an international student.\nFinding Friends\nI was really excited about coming to a whole new place,\nmeeting people, and making friends and memories!\nImperial has an incredibly diverse community with\nstudents from all over the world, something I found out\non my very first day here! So not only is this a wonderful\nopportunity for you to get to know other cultures, but\nit\u2019s also a comforting reassurance that there are other\nstudents like yourself trying to navigate life in a new city.\nThere are plenty of ways for you to meet new people,\nwhether it\u2019s through joining clubs and societies, mingling\nwith others at social events, or just simply walking up to\nsomeone for a chat!\nI personally met my closest friends in halls, where we\nwould hang out daily after classes and yap over bowls of\ncereal. Eventually, we moved in altogether as flat mates\nafter living in halls, and it was a lot of fun!\nWithin my course, I was initially quite intimidated by\neveryone, not because anyone was mean or rude, but\nbecause everyone in the room was top of their class,\nand I felt a bit like an imposter. But through the common\nstruggles of surviving our degree, I\u2019ve found that I had\nan extremely supportive and collaborative cohort of\nbioengineers, who helped me feel welcomed in this\nforeign land.\nFeeling Homesick\nBeing away from home can get tough, especially for those\nof us living on our own for the very first time.\nI\u2019ve found that finding a community that reminds you of\nhome is often a good way to stay grounded and a place to\nconnect with other people who share a similar experience\nwith you.\nYou can check out some of our cultural, faith, and\ncommunity societies to find your people, as well as the\nInternational Network and Interfaith Network to feel part\nof our wider community.\nFor me, I found home in the Mahjong Society, where I\nfound friends who also loved the game as much as I did,\nand I even got the chance to share and learn from other\ncultures and their variations of Mahjong!\nWhen I first moved here, staying in touch with my friends\nand family from Hong Kong was difficult to manage with\nthe time differences and distance. But overtime, I\u2019ve learnt\nto schedule time in my week to call them, and update on\nthe big and little things I\u2019d experienced lately, which has\nhelped me feel connected to home.\nCooking dishes from home has been another for me to\nfeel at home here in the UK (it helps that British food is just\nreally bland), but there are plenty of other ways that you\ncan do to remind you of home, so go ahead and explore\nthe things you can do!\nIt\u2019s the little things really\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack about being an international\nstudent here at Imperial that I can go on forever, but a few\nfinal notes from me are:\nSupermarkets and stores close early here (as early as\n5pm on Sundays!), so be sure to plan your shops ahead\nof time.\nPeople ALWAYS talk about the weather! Get to know\nthe British small talk culture and conversation starters, but\nalso to never take a sunny day for granted!\nLondon is an extremely walkable city, so take a stroll\naround, and explore life in the capital city!\nSocialising in the UK has traditionally been grabbing\na pint in the evening kind of vibe, and if you want to get\nimmersed in the pub culture, give it a go! But please don\u2019t\nfeel pressured to drink! As someone who doesn\u2019t drink,\nI've been working on introducing more non-alcoholic\ndrinks in our bars to make socialising as inclusive and\naccessible as possible.\nThat\u2019s all from me for now, but if you would like to get\nin touch with me, please do! You can find me at dpfs@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nAs you embark on this new chapter outside the comfort\nof your own home on your own, don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re\nnot alone!\nGood luck and have fun!\nProud mother of 18 plushies, Steph with Deputy President (Educa-tion) Emina Hogas.

In doing\nso, we abide by all applicable export control and sanction laws. In the UK, those\nregulations demand that exports are\nconsidered against a\nrange of criteria including relevant international law.\u201d\nThe group have\nalso discussed the\nnumber of sanctuary scholarships offered to Palestinian\nstudents, which they\nsay they \u201cwill continue to push for [the]\nnext academic year .\u201d\nAnother key concern\nof the encampment\nactivists was \u201cthe lack of clear policy on\nanti-Palestinian and anti-Arab racism\u201d.\nA representative of the activists stated:\n\u201cWe will continue to fight for the rights\nof everyone \u2013 including Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim staff and students \u2013 to\nfeel safe on campus.\u201d The negotiations\nremain ongoing.\nAn Imperial College spokesperson\nsaid:\u201cRecent and ongoing events in the\nMiddle East have understandably generated strong feelings and differing views\nwithin our community. In response to\nissues raised, senior representatives at\nImperial have engaged and will continue to engage with representatives from\na number of different Imperial student\nsocieties, with support from Imperial\nCollege Union. The safety and wellbeing\nof our community of students and staff is\nour top priority.\u201d\nStudents began protests and the encampment in response to the IDF\u2019s\nground war and bombardment campaign\non the Gaza strip.

Focusing just on the emissions\nImperial is most directly responsible for\n\u2013 scopes 1 and 2 \u2013 it is not only among the\ntop five highest emitting UK universities\nbut also has the highest emissions of any\nUK university per full time equivalent\nstaff and students.\nIt\u2019s no huge surprise then that Imperial scored a total of 40.4% in the People &\nPlanet University League 2023/24, scraping a 2:2. Yet less than a year later, the QS\nWorld University Rankings 2025 were\nreleased, with Imperial scoring 99.7 on\nSustainability, putting it 6th in the world\nand well above the University of Reading,\nwhich came first in the People & Planet\nleague and is known for its courses in\nclimate and sustainability. In fact, Imperial\u2019s score in the QS Sustainability Rankings jumped from 75.1 in 2023 to 97.0 in\n2024.\nImperial\u2019s main sources of emissions\nare fossil gas (15%), purchased electricity (6%), procurement and supply chain\n(38%); fuel and energy (3%), business\ntravel (11%), and student travel (24%).\nOther sources were either not reported\nor were less than 1% of emissions.\nImperial\u2019s recent net-zero strategy for\nestates is a major step forward. The plan\ncommits \u00a3920 million to \u00a31.52 billion\nto improvements to bring Imperial to\nnet-zero operational emissions by 2040.\nOne major saving will come from switch-ingfromcombinedheatandpower(CHP),\nwhich is responsible for the vast majority of scope 1 emissions, to heat pumps,\nand this benefit will only improve as the\ngrid decarbonises. The strategy details,\nbuilding-by-building, the fabric improvements required to make this possible.\nImperial\u2019s new Sustainable travel policy has a lot of ground to cover to mitigate Imperial\u2019s emissions from travel and\ncommuting. Nearly all of these emissions\nare scope 3 and so don\u2019t come under Imperial\u2019s net zero commitment; instead,\nImperial has committed to \u201cminimise\nScope 3 emissions as far as possible.\u201d\nThe policy focuses primarily on business\ntravel and requires travel by rail instead\nof air for journeys under five hours.\nCatering is another visible aspect of\nImperial\u2019s sustainability work. Imperial\u2019s\nmost recent Sustainability in Catering\nUpdate, published in June, highlights\ntheir 86% reduction in beef, one of the\nhighest emitting foods, of which 26% has\nbeen replaced with venison and they are\naheadofscheduleontheirtargettophase\nout beef completely by 2025/26. Last\nyear, Taste Imperial trialled Plantworks,\na plant-based catering outlet. This year,\nthe brand has been expanded with plant-based meals spread around other outlets\nand indicated with a sticker. Catering\nwas one of the first and fastest movers on\nsustainability at Imperial and they have\nbeen making other small changes which\nhave largely gone unnoticed by students\nand faculty.\nOne aspect of Imperial\u2019s low People &\nPlanet score is its policy on divestment.\n68% of UK universities have committed\nto divest from fossil fuels, according to\nPeople & Planet\u2019s Fossil Free campaign,\nwhereas Imperial has a partial commitment to divestment which we can expect\nmore clarity on later this academic year.\nWe\u2019re yet to see the real impacts of\nthese new policies on emissions, but\nwith all these new projects kicking in,\nthis is sure to be an exciting year for Sustainability at Imperial.\nImperial\u2019s sustainability policy\nis already making its mark\n\u00a3400Sophia\nPrizeupfor\ngrabsagain\nthisyear\nT\nhe Sophia Prize is a \u00a3400 prize\nfor an \u201coutstanding, inspiring,\nand accessible article that helps\ntackle climate defeatism and covers,\nor conceives of, an economic, cultur-al, or scientific innovation that helps\nfight global warming.\u201d\nThe 2023/24 prize went to Sabrina\nCittadino for her article on finding a\nuse for an otherwise harmful waste\nproduct from burning biodiesel. She\ninterviewed scientists and used research to show us an exciting inno-vation. Runners up included Zanna\nBuckland\u2019s article on converting roads\nto tram rails.\nActivists of all kinds know that the\ndisaster we must prevent is not excit-ing. That dread is not what makes people stand up and protest. It does not\nchange a mind; let alone the world.\nWhat excites is the better world we\ncan build. Free energy for all.

In it, Dr Ritchie addresses each of seven planetary crises: air\npollution, climate change, deforestation,\nfood, biodiversity loss, ocean plastics,\nand overfishing.\nThe book is extremely high-level. It\nlooks at each crisis and discusses how\nwe got here, where we are, and what we\ncan do. It focuses on what we should be\nworrying less about and more about, and\ntalks about the global strategies required\nto address each crisis. It all seems very\nsimple.\nNot the End of the World has a very specific scope, and that is to explain the big\nthings we need to do to address massive\nglobal issues, without making the reader\nfeel overwhelmed. It aims to inspire action by making these problems seem intensely solvable. Unfortunately, the major barrier to better environmental policy\nis no longer coming up with the ideas;\nit is actually passing and implementing\nthem. That means both getting through\nNIMBYs and fossil fuel companies, and\ndealing with every unique circumstance\nand ensuring actual justice when implementing each policy. For example, here\u2019s\na statistic you might not have heard:\n11-173\nmillion\nis the number of people displaced by\nconservation efforts, according to a 2009\npaper. Over the last 30 years, the vast majority of deforestation has been in South\nAmerica and Africa. Tropical forests are\nincredibly complex systems, prone to\nunforeseen tipping points. Conserving\nthem is important, but ongoing efforts to\nprotect forests are being used to achieve\nthe same colonial aims that have defined\nthe last two centuries.\nConservation is often done without\nconsultation and displaces indigenous\ncommunities. These areas can be mil-itarised and communities forcibly displaced in the name of, for example, the\n30% protected terrestrial land by 2030\ntarget (30x30). The massive range of 11-173 million belies the lack of research in\nthis area.\nIf we want to ensure justice, or even\njust avoid displacing even more indigenous people from their lands, we in developed nations need to understand this\nissue much better. 30x30 is an admirable\ngoal and we need to get there in a way\nthat both meaningfully establishes spaces for conservation and ensures a just\ntransition.\nLikely the biggest way we could free up\nland would be reforming our diets and\nagricultural system:\n828\nmillion\nis the number of people globally affected by hunger in 2021, the WHO reported.\nThe UN FAO found that 76% of agricultural land is used for animal agriculture\n\u2013 not because we give our animals lots of\nspace, but because we use so much space\ngrowing crops to feed them \u2013 to produce\nonly 17% of our calories and 38% of our\nprotein.\nBywastingcaloriesthroughinefficient\nanimal agriculture, a 2013 paper found\nthat people in the UK consume less than\nhalf as many calories as we actually grow.\nWe need to address both the at least 20%\nof emissions from agriculture and global hunger concurrently by eating more\nplants and raising fewer livestock and we\nneed to do all that without putting further pressure on small farmers.\nOne area where the crisis and ensuring justice are more closely aligned is the\ncrisis of air pollution. More action on this\nis something that Dr Ritchie is \u2013 rightly \u2013\nespecially passionate about. Here\u2019s why:\n235.97\nmillion\nmillion is the number of disability-ad-justed life years (DALYs) the world lost to\nair pollution in 2021, according to Our\nWorld in Data. Losing a DALY, if you\u2019re\nnot a Medicine student, is the equivalent\nof losing one year in good health because\nof premature mortality or disability. Air\npollution takes many more lives than ter-rorism, war, homicides, HIV/AIDS, road\naccidents, and obesity combined. It is\na critical issue for us to address but it is\nalso a solvable problem.\nAir pollution has been falling across\nthe developed world for decades. In London, for example, air pollution is down\n97% since its peak in the late 19th centu-ry, making air pollution a much less worrying problem than before. This process\ncan be replicated in developing nations\nand developed nations ought to be help-ing.\nWhen we think about climate change,\nwe probably think mostly about greenhouse gases and fossil fuels, and those\nare huge issues. The grand stat is of\ncourse:\n423.44\nppm\nis the annual average atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide concentration as of August 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found. CO2\nis usually measured in parts per million\n(ppm): 423.44 ppm means that the atmosphere is 0.0423% CO2\n, which seems\nlike a pretty small percentage, except\nthat for the last 800,000 years CO2\nconcentrations have stayed between 200\nand 300 ppm. Over the past 40 years or\nso, CO2\nconcentration has been increasing at a fairly constant rate, but that rate\nis still about 100 times faster than any\nprevious natural increase.\nCO2\nis the least potent greenhouse gas\nwe need to worry about, but this stat,\nalongside the concentrations of other\ngreenhouse gases, is the ultimate authority on how successful our efforts to\nmitigate climate change and reduce our\nemissions have been. It is not, however,\nthe ultimate authority of how successful we have been in fighting any actual\ncrisis. Greenhouse gases are a useful\nmeasure because they cause future and\ncurrent suffering, but they are not the\nsuffering \u2013 and that is the cornerstone\nof what we need to look to when we\ntry to address climate change. Climate\nadaptation, preparing for the effects of\nglobal warming, is just as important as\nmitigation.\nDr Ritchie is right. It is not the end of\nthe world. It feels like hope that drives action is in rather short supply. In addressing that, her work is critically important.\nNot the End\nof the World\nEnvironmentEditor\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nMaize is one of the most land efficient crops, using only 0.65 m2\nper 1000 kCal\n\n"

I wrote the article above to help first-year students understand Imperial\u2019s societies a bit\nbetter. I remember my first week at Imperial and feeling\noverwhelmedwithallthesocieties.Iwantedtojointhem\nall, but only managed to sign up to five or six of them. I\nchose Felix to cover society events and learn a bit of each.\nSince I started, I\u2019ve reviewed plays and performances,\ncovered events hosting inspiring speakers and took\npart in cultural celeberations. If you just thought, \u201cThat\nsounds cool, I want in!\u201d, scan the\nQR code, send me an email, and\nwe can talk more about what you\nwould like to do. Don\u2019t worry, you\ndon\u2019t need to be the perfect writer,\njust interested.\nS\nocieties at UK universities, unlike\nthe party throwing, car-wash\nfundraising, Kappa-Omega societies\nportrayed by Hollywood movies, consist\nof hobby-associated student groups,\nmanaged and financed partly by students\nand the Union. This year, Imperial\nCollege Union added 12 new societies to\nthe never-ending list of Clubs, Societies,\nand Projects (CSPs), reaching a count\nof 365 societies, each falling into one of\nnine categories.\nThe Nine Categories\nThe Sports category hosts 93 different\nclubs, from the most common sports\nsuch as football and tennis, to less\nknown ones such as pole and aerial,\nand synchronised swimming. Some\nsports have men and womens teams,\nand some are ICSM or \u201cMedics\u201d teams,\nmeaning all members come from\nImperial\u2019s medical school. These clubs\nwill generally request a Imperial Athletic\nMembership as a base requirement to\nfund an additional membership to the\nteam. With an average fee of \u00a335, and a\nmaximum of \u00a390 to cover equipment\ncosts and coaches\u2019 fees, they are the most\nexpensive memberships to join; however,\nthey include a year of sports, training,\nsocial nights, and games \u2013 including the\nchance to play against other universities.\nAs a fair warning, these can become\nvery competitive, with members split\ninto teams based on abilities. Last year\u2019s\nmartial arts societies joined this year\u2019s\nSports category.\nThe Medical School was granted its\nown category this year, named ICSM. It\nconsists of 46 CSPs focused on medical\nspecialities or artistic groups.\nFor thrill-seekers who enjoy athletic\noutdoor activities, the Outdoor category\noffers 17 clubs such as mountaineering,\nmotorsports, gliding, surfing, skydiving,\nand racing.\nThe 42 academic-related clubs\ncommonly supplement what members\nlearn academically with speaker events\nand external challenges to attend.\nFor example, the Developer Student\nClub aims to teach its members tech-industry-related skills and provide career\nguidance.\nOf the cultural societies, there are 57,\nproviding a home for all international\nstudents. These are often organised\neither by region or by language, such as\nthe Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands, and\nLuxembourg) society and the Russian\nSpeaking society respectively.\nThe 31 Arts & Entertainment societies\ninclude theatrical, musical, and written\nentertainment. These often offer\nspectacular Friday night performances\nfor prices far cheaper than that of West\nEnd. It also includes Imperial\u2019s radio and\nnewspaper.\nHobby clubs, which used to be under\nthe Social and Indoor categories, are\nthe most diverse societies, ranging\nfrom Harry Potter society, to DogSoc, to\nAnimeSoc. They are incredibly fun to\nattend, and offer a relief from stressful\nacademics.\nLastyearscharitableandfaithsocieties\nare now combined into the Community\ncategory, the former dedicated to\ngood causes, fundraising and raising\nawareness, the latter to religious groups.\nDepartmental societies are great\nopportunities to become acquainted\nwith staff and students from different\ncourses of years in the same department.\nStudents can forge useful connections\nto build a network \u2013 useful for summer\nresearch internships (UROPs) or lab\npositions.\nWhere to read more\nEveryCSPcanbevisitedunderthe\u201cAtoZ\u201d\npage on eActivities with details on their\ncurrent committee, their membership\nprices, merchandise to buy from the\nUnion store, and links to their email and\nsocial media.

That\u2019s something I know all too well. Arriving at Imperial, you\u2019ll\nbe thrown into session after session of induction\ntalks, each competing for your attention and interest,\nmaking it extremely hard to know what\u2019s truly important.\nI want to convince you to look beyond your studies for a\nmoment.\nWhilst at school I found my outlet through theatre,\npiano, and hockey, so coming into Imperial I already\nknew what I wanted. As soon as I received my results,\nfollowed swiftly by confirmation of my place at Imperial,\nmy first thoughts were not to look for information about\nmy course, my halls, or London, but to scramble for the\nhockey Facebook page (yes, Facebook, I know) to find\nout how to sign up. My journey began with joining the\nhockey club, and from there, I got involved in volunteering\nwith the Sports Committee and became the Sports Chair.\nThat led me to where I am today, representing all clubs,\nsocieties, and projects at Imperial.\nI was lucky enough to know early on what I enjoyed,\nbut this experience isn\u2019t common. Despite being more\nconnected as a society, with more opportunities available\nat the touch of a button than ever before, ironically, it\u2019s\nbecome harder than ever to explore the breadth of what\u2019s\non offer as a student and find a community in which\nyou feel you belong. It can be incredibly daunting, being\ninundated with information and no sense of where to\nstart, especially if you\u2019ve never taken part in something\nextracurricular before.\n\u201cBut why should I even bother?\u201d, I hear you ask. After\nall, you come to Imperial to study at a world-leading\ninstitution, not to have fun! The truth is, the significance\nof taking part in something outside of academia cannot\nbe understated. For one, it can have an enormous impact\non your academic performance. Allowing yourself an\noutlet from your studies, a chance to de-compress and\nenjoy yourself, enables your mind and body to reset,\nmeaning that when you study you study better. Just\nsearch \u201cthe effect of extracurricular activities on academic\nperformance\u201d if you\u2019re not already convinced.\nBeyond the academic benefits, however, lie what I see\nas the much greater good of taking part in activities at\nImperial \u2013 finding your crowd. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am\ntoday without my community. Clich\u00e9d it may be, I truly\nbelieve that my experiences in sports and societies have\nshaped who and where I am today, allowing me to meet\nso many friends and experience more than I ever could\nhave through my studies alone.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m convinced, but where do I start?\u201d While\nI may have already known what I wanted to do at uni,\nmany of you won\u2019t \u2013 this is okay! That\u2019s where the\nUnion comes in. You\u2019re bound to find a community\nin which you truly belong and can thrive, out of over\n340 student-led groups, and if you can\u2019t, you can start\nsomething new! I would love for you to join us from\n11am-4pm on Tuesday 1st October for Welcome Fair,\nwhere you can meet almost every society and sports\nclub on offer and find out about the free \u201cGive It A Go\u201d\nsessions they\u2019ll be offering.\nYou\u2019ll find that as times change, so do your interests\nand preferences, but if you take away one thing from my\nramblings today let it be this: Joining a student society,\nproject or sports club will enrich your whole university\nexperience, providing an outlet from your studies, and\nfor many will play a pivotal role in who they shape out\nto be.\nWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? Get out there and\ntry something new this year!\nChristian Cooper with his hockey team at Varsity 2022. Christian has been an avid hockey player since his time at school, and was able to\ncontinue his passion at Imperial. Joining the hockey club meant Christian was able to develop professionally as well, becoming involved with\nthe Sports Committee, which led him to run for his role as deputy president. Christian Cooper\nI truly believe that my experiences\nin sports and societies have\nshaped who and where I am today\n\u201c\n\n"

Michele is the principal\ninvestigator of the magnetometer device\nonboard this spacecraft, which will be\narriving at Jupiter in 2031 to ascertain\nthe possibility of life existing on its\nGalilean moons. This interview followed\nafter the launch of the JUICE spacecraft\nin April 2023. Since then, Professor\nDougherty has been appointed Executive\nChair of the Science and Technology\nFacilities Council (STFC).\nOur new science writers who joined as\nfreshers last year contributed massively\nto the paper! Elizabeth Glasson and\nEleanor Goulding spoke with Daniel\nKhosravinia, a 3rd\n-year Biochemistry\nstudent who published his DNA double\nhelix model on Lego Ideas. Emily\nWentworth interviewed research\nassociate Dr Robin Lamboll in his Nature\npaper studying the Earth\u2019s remaining\ncarbonbudget.RegularcolumnistsJames\nDesmet and Jasmine Marenzi wrote some\nexcellent articles on the pharmaceutical\nindustry and proteins. Lastly, Tejas Gupta\ncontributed several noteworthy pieces\nto the paper, including an interview\nwith academic Dr Quentin Smith on his\nresearch in CRISPR-CAS9 drug therapy.\nOne of the highlights of the year\nwas when Professor Brian Cox came to\nvisit Imperial to honour the late Abdus\nSalam, former Physics Professor at\nImperial and Nobel Laurette, whom\nthe central library is now named after.\nWhat touched me most was the article a\nscience writer, and dear friend of mine,\nNeha Yasin, published following the\nevent. The piece was a touching tribute\nto Salam, who despite winning the Nobel\nPrize and becoming the first Muslim\nto do so, was persecuted in his home\ncountry of Pakistan simply because of\nhis faith. Neha belongs to the same sect\nof Islam as Salam, and her narrative and\nreflection on this shared experience were\nparticularly moving.\nAs we look into a new academic year,\nwe have lots of exciting science to look\nout for. The Nobel prizes in Physics,\nChemistry, and Medicine are soon to be\nawarded. Imperial\u2019s Great Exhibition\nRoad Festival will also be back again this\nacademic year.

Even if\nthere are a hundred different people with\na plethora of workout routines that you\u2019d\nbe tempted to adopt, my advice is to pick\nsomething that works best for you. Not\nevery workout routine will suit you.\nThe Arnold split\nWith that in mind, the routine I\u2019m\nsuggesting to you today, is best for\nbeginners who want to start getting into\ngeneral weight lifting and bodybuilding.\nWhile the only qualifications I have\nas a personal trainer are abs and big\narms, the chief creator of this routine \u2013\nArnold Schwarzenegger \u2013 has a lot more\nbodybuilding credibility to his name.\nThe routine I am about to suggest\nbuilds off of Arnold\u2019s book, The\nEncyclopaedia of Bodybuilding, a fantastic\nsource for any fitness enthusiast. It even\ngoes into detail about how to diet, pose,\nand train specifically for competitions.\nFollowing this routine, I\u2019ve been able\nto weight train consistently for over\ntwo years without any serious injury\nor setbacks, all while noticing definite\nmuscular gains. The workouts, and splits\namong weekday, are shown in the table\nbelow.\nExercise tips\nForeachofthefollowingworkouts,you\nshould be going for three sets, each with\na one minute rest time between each set.\nThis should bring each workout session\u2019s\nduration to about 70-80 minutes.\nAnother important rule to follow for\neachworkoutistooverloadprogressively.\nHere, you start your first set with your\nlightest weight and end your last set with\nthe heaviest weight you can do. Don\u2019t go\ntoo heavy, otherwise you risk an injury,\nbut do try to push yourself. I recommend\nsets of 15, 12, and 10 reps.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with any of these\nworkouts and haven\u2019t done them before,\nstart by learning the correct form of the\nmovement. This means starting with\nvery light weights and just making sure\nyou get the full range of motion described\nby the workout.\nAnother tip is to log and to keep track\nof your workouts. I am aware that there\nare also apps to do this. I prefer having\na physical little notebook that you can\ncarry with you in the gym. Take note\nof which workouts you did, what your\nheaviest weight was for each exercise,\nand whether you experienced any\ndiscomfort that was out of the ordinary\nduring any specific exercise. This helps to\nkeep track of how much you\u2019re growing\nand improving. Looking back at your\npages to review your progress can be a\nhuge self-esteem boost.\nFinally,evenifyoufeelthissplitdoesn\u2019t\nwork for you, the workouts presented\nhere are the fundamentals of weight\nlifting and should be incorporated into\nyour workout one way or another. I\u2019d\nrecommendtryingalltheseexercisesand\nthen creating a more convenient split/\nschedule for yourself that includes them.\nIf you\u2019re unsure of what the right form\nfor some of the exercises are, there are\nplenty of online resources that can help\nyou. I personally like to use youtube to\nconfirm that my form is right whenever\nI start a new exercise.\nIf you\u2019d like to talk about this more,\nI\u2019m always up for a chat and a workout\nand love helping out fellow gym-goers\nno matter what stage of their journey\nthey are at. Best of luck working out and\ngetting your dream body!\nA Fresher\u2019s\nfitness gym\nguide\nSPORTS\nSportsWriter\nSIDDHARTA ADAIKALARAJ\nA beginner\u2019s guide to weightlifting with\nArnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s classic routine\nRecommended gym split and workout exercises, based on Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s split from The\nEncyclopaedia of Bodybuilding.\nSid, fourth year Theoretical Physics student, getting into his shoulder exercises at Ethos\ngym.\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n22 | Business 27 September 2024\nW\nhile the banning of X, formerly\nTwitter, in Brazil may have made\nheadlines, investors would do\nwell to follow the real story \u2013 the decision\nto seize Starlink\u2019s assets to cover the fines\nimposed on X. Both X and Starlink, a\nsatellite internet service provider, share\npartial ownership with Elon Musk;\nhowever, legally they have no connection\nin either US or Brazil, and have different\nsets of investors. Bill Ackman, an\ninfluential activist hedge fund manager\nat Pershing Square Capital Management\nand partial investor in X, issued a\nwarning, stating that the decision could\nmake Brazil \u201cuninvestable\u201d and could\nlead to capital flight from the country.\nAlthough Ackman\u2019s words may be heavy-handed, investors are right to worry\nabout the implications of the ruling and\nwhat it could mean for navigating legal\nuncertainty in the Americas second-largest market.\nThe situation escalated on August\n17th when X announced the closure of its\nBrazilian offices, following a prolonged\nlegal dispute within the country\u2019s\ncourt system regarding the banning of\nseveral accounts alleged to be spreading\ndisinformation. In its statement, X also\ncited concerns that representatives of the\ncompany could be arrested if it refused\nto comply with government directives\nto remove such accounts. In response,\non August 29th, Supreme Court Justice\nAlexandre de Moraes announced the\nbanning of X within the country and\nlevied fines of 18.5 million reals (\u00a32.5\nmillion) for non-compliance with legal\nrequirementsforsocialmediacompanies\nto maintain local representation within\nthe country. While those familiar with\nBrazilian law would find the ruling\nprocedural and well within precedent,\nwhat was highly unusual was the reason\ngiven for seizing Starlink\u2019s assets to\ncover the fines owed by X. In his ruling,\nJustice Moraes stated that Starlink and\nX function as a \u201cde facto economic unit\u201d\nand therefore Starlink could be held\nresponsible for X\u2019s fines.\nIn the initial ruling, Starlink\u2019s\nassets were frozen, and the company\nannounced it would pursue legal action\nagainst the decision. However, it missed\nthe deadline to appeal the decision,\nfurther complicating the situation. It\nalso told regulators it would not comply\nwith the court\u2019s order to block X in the\ncountry but later reversed its position.\nAfter the fines were withdrawn from its\naccounts to cover X\u2019s penalties, Starlink\u2019s\naccounts were unfrozen.\nIn a set of interviews with the\nconservative Brazilian newspaper Gazeta\ndo Povo, legal experts concurred with\nthe assessment that such a ruling could\ndeter foreign investment in Brazil.\nBrazil ranks as the world\u2019s fifth-largest\nrecipient of foreign direct investment.\nHowever, with the election of Lula da\nSilva, Brazil has faced criticism, for\nmoving in an irresponsible direction\nwith high public spending\nand growing deficits.\nAdding to the pressure is\nthe growing perception\namong regional investors\nthat Argentina, with\nits increased market-friendly reforms, might make for a more\nattractive option for foreign capital.\nHowever, despite such concerns, Brazil\nremains a resource-rich developing\nmarket, but the questions remains\nabout whether investors will see this as\nsomething deeper or an isolated case.\nBUSINESS\nStarlink took the fall for X\u2019s case in Brazil\nBusinessWriter\nLEO IRGENDWO\nWhy the use of Starlink\u2019s assets to pay for X\u2019s fines undermines Brazil\u2019s\nrule of law and could strain foreign investment\nJudge Alexandre de Moraes\nWikimedia Commons\nElon Musk Wikimedia Commons\nHello!\nMy name is Alia Friedman\nand I am the new Business\nEditor at Felix.

Excluding\nthe Welcome Fair, this leaves just three\noccasionstomeetnewfaces.Realistically,\nthese might see a lower attendance. The\nother Freshers, weary after a festive first\nweekend, could be tempted to snub these\nlater events with a less obvious focus on\nsocialising, and less vibrant titles (\u201cBeit\nFarm\u201d has arguably less of a festive ring\nthan \u201cVK House Party\u201d).\nThe unhappy few\nThe issue is of direct concern to a rather\nrestricted group. Although Imperial\ndoes not release data regarding the\nage of incoming students specifically,\nthe most recent statistical report\n(from the 2020-2021 academic year)\nidentifies approximately 50 underage\nundergraduate students in total, the\nvast majority of which reasonably\ncan be assumed to be in their first\nyear of study. This number pales in\ncomparison to the total number of\nincoming undergraduates, which\nrevolves around 3000 yearly. Raising\nthis issue is thus not an attempt at\ndiscrediting the effort that is already\nput into Welcome Week, which would\nbe ungrateful to the Union\u2019s dedication\nto making integration as smooth as\npossible. Most freshers keep fabulous,\nalbeit hazy, memories of this modern\nrite of passe, and its characteristic\nassortment of tolerated excesses. But\nagain, most freshers are over eighteen,\nand equality should not have any regard\nfor numbers.\nFully integrating underage students\ninto these famously rowdy events while\nrespecting British laws protecting\nminors would make these events\nmore challenging to organise and\ncontrol. The unlawfulness of selling\nalcohol to minors explains why they\nare unwelcome in many venues,\nincluding those on campus, although\nlegally 16- and 17-year-olds can enter\nnightclubs if accompanied by their\nolder peers. Universities have also\ngrown increasingly wary of scandals\nand denunciation, in the wake of the\nsocial movements that shook them in\nthe last years, and amidst the recent\nbacklash against hazing. A fear of\nany incident involving minors may\nwell have contributed to the current\nstrictness.\nNevertheless, since the Equality Act\n2010 prohibits educational institutions\nfrom discriminating against applicants\nbased on age, and given Imperial\u2019s\nlongstanding commitment to the\nwelcoming of all profiles, arrangements\nshould be made. Agreeing that the\nisolation of younger students \u2013 whatever\ntheir number \u2013 in the first week of\nuniversity has no impact on the fostering\nof communal bonds, or the creation of\ndiverse social groups, requires either\nabundant imagination or blatant\ndishonesty. This is especially true as the\nculture of gap years is not as strong in\nmany foreign countries, meaning the\nsidelined students are more likely to\nbe international, adding the burden of\na potential language barrier or culture\nshock.\nYou reached for the secret too soon\nSome may point out that underage\nFreshers have made the choice not\nto delay their entry to university, but\nwe can hardly make the case that it is\nan eccentric idea to start studying as\nsoon as one possibly can. After all, \u201cI\nchallenge the status quo and seek better\nways of [\u2026] having an impact\u201d is one of\nthe \u201cpositive behaviours\u201d encouraged by\nImperial.\nWorking around the practical details\nof a universally welcoming integration\nweek is possible without introducing\ntoo much complexity. Many hall-specific events already use a bracelet\nsystem that allows bar staff to quickly\nidentify those entitled to alcohol\nconsumption, ensuring all residents\ncan join in. Bracelet allocation does not\nsignificantly increase queuing time, as\nidentification checks at the entrance\nof these events are already standard\npractice.\nObviously, clubbing events in external\nvenues, which remain most popular,\nshould neither be abandoned nor open to\nunderage students. Instead, more events\ndesigned to bring newcomers together\nshould be introduced to compensate, be\nthey copies of the existing events with\nregulated access to alcoholic drinks.\nA quantum of solace\nAt any rate, if even considered, these\nchanges won\u2019t be enacted in time to\nbenefit this year\u2019s Freshers. In fact, the\nissueisunlikelytobecomemorerelevant.\nThe proportion of school students who\nskip a year consistently hovers around a\nsingle percent, and most forecasts agree\nthat the enrollment of international\nstudents (a subgroup more likely to enter\nuniversity before eighteen) has peaked in\nthe past year.\nWhat can then be done? While it is an\nopen secret that the meticulousness and\nprevalence of age-checking at the Union\nBar drop significantly after Fresher\u2019s\nWeek,makingthesepreviousrestrictions\nsomewhat hypocritical, lying about your\nage in such a context remains illegal, and\ncertainly not advisable.\nInstead, those who \u2013 either by choice\nor by a lack thereof \u2013 miss out on the\nwildest nights out should focus on the\nWelcome Fair, and leverage the uniquely\nwide range of clubs and societies offered\nto them. It remains the best way to make\nmeaningful bonds in circumstances that\nare less harmful to the liver, eardrums,\nand reputation.\nOver half of the Union-sponsored hours of\nsocialising a Fresher can look forward to this\nyear are not available to under-eighteens\n\u201c\nBecome\nanopinion\nwriter!\nIs your friend group tired of\nhearing your hot takes on every\ntopic?
