They will\ncome down three days after someone has\nstood.\nBicycle Insurance\nLast week I pointed out that bikes are not\ninsured by the Union if you live in Hall or\nHouse. Since then there have been further\nreports of bikes stolen, especially from behind\nLinstead.\nI gave details of one such policy to students\n\u2014 Cycleguard. Since then Roger Nuttall has\npointed out to me information from Freewheeling and Daily Cyclist.\nNational and local cycling authorities received\nnotification of Cycleguard insurance, arranged\nthrough the National Association of British\nCyclists in January of this year. For \u00a39.50\nmembership of the Association the applicant\nreceives loss or damage cover for a cycle up to\n\u00a3200 value, third party and personal cover.\nHowever, in March, the Association claimed to\nhave a membership of 6,000 recruited in two\nmonths, which seems to be rather far fetched.\nAlso nobody from the ABC had moved into\nLinburn House, their quoted address. Evidence\nof registration for the Association. Cycleguard\nor Cycleguard Managers Ltd (the company\nbacking the Association) has not been formed.\nNo one has yet (in March) received a copy of\nthe master insurance policy and none of the\nauthorities Mr Bassett, the chairman of the\nAssociation of British Cyclists, claims to have\ncontacted have any record of him.\nCycle Insurance\nAs a student, separate cycle insurance will be\ndifficult if not impossible to obtain. Cycles can\nbe covered by some household policies but be\ncareful \u2014 some will only cover the cycle when\nit is inside the house! Insurance can be\narranged through membership of certain documented and active organisations (compare\nCycleguard!).\nCyclists' Touring Club\nAnnual membership is \u00a37.00 (\u00a34.20 for age 20\nand under) for which you will receive: free legal\naid (which seems to be most successful);\n\u00a3 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 third party insurance; touring information service; cycle touring magazine\n(bimonthly); recommended accommodation\nand cycle shops (some with discounts for\nmembers) and local activities throughout the\ncountry. The Club also carries some weight in\narguments over British Rail cycle schemes,\ncycle tracks, road building schemes, etc and it\nis respected by the authorities.\nCycle insurance is arranged through a Cornhill master policy which covers the cycle\nagainst theft or damage and provides personal\naccident cover. The cost for this is approx 6%\nof the cycle value with a15% discount if more\nthan one cycle is insured.\nCyclists' Touring Club\nCotterell House\n69 Meadrow\nGodlaming\nSurrey\nGU73 HS London Cycling Campaign\nThis is the capital's cycling action group.\nMembership is \u00a31.00 per year which provides\nthe quarterly newsletter Daily Cyc/ist,legal and\ncampaigning power and discounts (up to 10%)\nat many cycle shops.\nInsurance is arranged through the Salvation\nArmy General Insurance Corporation. \u00a35.50\nprovides theft only coverage for any cycle up\nto \u00a3200 vau e and \u00a3250,000 third party cover.\nFor details send a9\" by 4 V2\" sae to:\nLondon Cycling Campaign\nThe Colombo St Centre\nColombo Street\nLondon\nSE1\nThe British Cycling Federation\nThis is the national racing cyclists' association\nand it too can arrange insurance cover for its\nmembers.

    "content": "DEMONSTRATORS REPLY\nDear Colin\nAs members of the anti-AyatoUah\ndemonstrators dur i rg the siege of\nthe Iranian Embassy, we feel that\nthe reasons behind the demonstration\nshould be made clear. It was\nintended to show disapproval of\nsupporters of a regime which is\ninhumane and irresponsible. The\nIranians concerned were taking\nadvantage of a delicate situation in\norder to publicise their feelings for\nKhomeini and against President\nCarter and the American people.\nWe did not want to let the World\nbelieve that the British people\nwould sta'nd by without showing\ndisapproval of such actions. If the\nIranians have the right to support\nthe Khomeini regime, then likewise\nwe have a right to protest. The IC\nstudent who feels sickened by the\nmanner of the protest should\nperhaps consider the chants and\nslogans of the Iranian demonstrators\nand the unthinking way in which\nthey worship such a dictator.\nAlso, in response to your editorial,\nit should be said that the police did\nnot keep the Iranians in isolation.\nThey were free to lea ve the compound at any time in order to obtain food\nand drink and to use the toilet.\nYours sincerely\nBob Dean, Mark Kenrick, Dave\nCrossman, P Clifton (and signed by\n47 others)\nHighest level of student activity\nat IC in years\nDear Colin\nI think it is fair to say that IC\nstudents, in general, do not like\ngetting involved in student union\nexternal affairs, with most demonstrations attended by just a handful.\nIt therefore surprises me that when\nhundreds of IC students turn out\nto demonstrate against the Ayatotlah\nKhomeini, the Union sits back and\ndoes nothing!\nThis was a genuine protest\nagainst Iran's 'spiritual leader', who,\nnot content with butchering over\neight hundred of his own nation in\nthe name of Islam, decides to\nthreaten world peace by kidnapping\nthe staff of the American Embassy.\nThen with Iranian students\nhaving the cheek to take to the\nstreets of London and extol his\nvirtues, it was only right that we\nshould show them what we think.\nThe ridicule certainly did get\nhome to the Iranian students and I am sure that the demonstration in\nno way affected the situation inside\nthe Embassy. But for those that did\nfeel that it was too frivolous, they\ncan only blame the Union for not\norganising it. The same Union\nOfficers that complain about\napathy, failed to respond to the\nhighest level of student activity at\nIC in years, and that is a gross\nneglect of duty.\nDavid Gayer\nTICKLING THE IVORIES VERBOSITY\nDear Colin\nIn view of Chris Fox's and\nother's comments regarding the\nresponsibility of IC demonstrators\nat the recent Embassy siege, I would like to say a few words.\nAlthough I admit that there was\ntemptation from the idea of playing\nthe piano on TV, the main reason\nwhy I wheeled the RCS instrument\nwas to add my voice to those of\nthe many saying \"don't give us\nthat Ayatollah crap\". While I was\npresent the mood was certainly\none of carnival and I feel that my\ncontribution, and that of most\nothers on the IC side of the fence,\nwas to further this mood and\ndefinitely not intended to provoke\nviolence.\nI felt that the presence of the\npro-Khomeini demonstrations was\ninsulting to our nation and deserved\nto be ridiculed by that 'Great\nBritish sense of humour'. Why\ninsulting? you may ask. In pledging\ntheir support for Khomeini, the\nIranian demonstrators were supporting the further detainment of the\nfifty American hostages in Iran. (It\nis interesting to note here that in\nthis case it was the 'host nation' to\nthe terrorism (Britian) that freed\nthe hostages, simply in upholding\nits laws and protecting foreign\ndiplomats. Does Iran condone the\nactions of the terrorists who are\nstill playing with the lives of fifty\ninnocent people?) It appears the\nKhomeini regime itself is playing\nthe terrorist no wonder they are\nprepared to sacrifice the odd life or\ntwenty. I deplore terrorism and\ncannot in any way sym pathis e with\nsupporters of any kind of terrorism.\nFor Khomeini followers to parade\nour peaceful and civilised streets,\ntrying to justify the holding of the\nAmerican hostages by offering\nthemselves in, shall we say, part\npayment, seems to me barbaric\nand an insult to us.\nNo: I am not a skinhead/Nazi\nNF/a Buddhist monk; I believe in\npeace \u2014 else why did not I throw\nbricks rather than tickle the ivory.\nYours, a little offended\nBarney McCabe\nISLAMIC Society comments\nDear Colin\nReference to the article on\nRelations Between Iran and the\nUnited States in last Friday's FELIX: I would like to point out the\nfollowing.\nMr Justin Newland does not\nhave any knowledge, however,\nbasic about Islam. He mentions\nthat Islam means God, but the\nword means submission to the\nGod. He speaks about Mohammedanism whereas we ONLY regard ourselves as MOSLEMS, ie,\nthose who submit to God. We\nregard Mohammad as a human\nbeing, just as we regard Moses and\nJesus as human beings; we believe\nthat they were all prophets with\nessentially the same message. Each\ncoming to give the truth. We also\nbelieve that present day Christianity\nand Judaism is distorted from the\noriginal versions and therefore the\nremaining true teachings are those\nin the Quran (still in its original\nform) and in the documental life of\nprophet Mohammad.\nMr Newland \u2014 surely not a historian of great stature \u2014 lays\ndown a theory about the aryan\nraces which exposes his ignorance\nabout the situation in Iran. Let me\nassure Mr Newland that the whole\nof the Moslem world is in turbulence\nbecause the teachings of Islam\nprohibit all forms of Evil (ref\nQuran), regards men and women\nas equal before God. It stresses\nthat a Moslem's duty is to eradicate\nthe Evil. He must use all routes laid\ndown by God to do. this. (He\ncannot give back the other cheek\nwhen faced with evil.)\nThe Islamic Society of Imperial\nCollege has sent a brief guide about\nIslam to all students and most staff.\nThe aim was to clear many misconceptions about Islam, common\nin England. I suggest Mr Newland\nreads his.\nYours\nY. El-Saie\non behalf of Islamic Society\nDear Mr Editor\nWe would like to communicate\nour displeasure at the polysyllabic\ndiarrhoea emanating from the\nstylus of Mr Newland. Hisadscititious\nverbosity merely serves to obfuscate\nthe subject matter.\nYours obj urga t ely The Bernard Levin Appreciation\nSociety\nDEMO\nSir\nThe counter-demonstration by\nIC students attracted much adverse\ncriticism in your letter columns last\nweek. The balance needs to be\nredressed.\nIt was suggested that the demonstration hindered negotiations with\nthe gunmen. There is no evidence\nto support this. The demo was\nconducted in good humour and at\na safe distance (set by the police).\nIf it had been decided that the\npresence of demonstrators was\nadversely affecting negotiations the\npolice would have dispersed the\ncrowd. '\nIt was also claimed that the\nbehaviour of the students betrayed a complete indifference to the tragic\nevents in Iran. Many full-time\nstudents are able to tolerate\nviolations of international law and\nbasic human rights only because of\nthe lack of opportunity to satisfy\ntheir conscience.\nHowever, when supporters of\nthe religious zealot who presides\ngleefully over such travers ties of\njustice sing his praises just a hundred metres down the road it\nwarms my heart to see so many\nstudents take the chance to exercise\ntheir democratic right and show\ntheir disgust.\nIt would have been irresponsible\nto let slip this chance of showing\nour condemnation of the Ayatollah\nKhomeini.\nSomeone (in the anonymous\nletter) was concerned at the way\nour message was put across. But I ask you, how does one argue with\na brainwashed fanatic who seriously\nbelieves that the gunmen were CIA\nspies?\nYours faithfully\nMark Clegg\nNeil Masom\nPseudo-intellectual\nramblings\nDear Colin\nJustin Newland in his article on\nthe Iranian crisis failed to explore\nthe fundamental reasons why this\nis one of the most serious events of\nthe post-war period. His pseudo-intellectual ramblings left me\nwondering why he had bothered,\nhis vocabulary appeared to be\ndesigned to overawe rather than\ninform the reader.\nWhat is important is that the\nIranian 'students' have violated\ndiplomatic immunity, the invasion\nof the US Embassy was an act of\nwar since the Embassy constitutes\nAmerican soil. If the Americans\nagree to the terms demanded this\nwould then put every foreign\nembassy in the world at risk. We\nhave an impasse. The Americans\nattempted to break this by military\naction, the one opportunity they\nhad resulted in a dismal debacle\nwith the hostages dispersed.\nHowever, pressure will be applied\nand, in the interests of international\ndiplomacy through which peace is\nmaintained, must be successful.\nThe Iranian leadership must appreciate that fact.\nMr Newland misses his chance\nto contribute to this discussion\nwith his fatuous essay. To accuse\nall western media of being \"notoriously biased\" is libellous. He fails\nto state that the UN is there to\ncope with such situations, in this\nrespect there are parallels with the\nfate of the League of Nations.\nHis historical perspectives are\nrather weak, especially when\nconcerning the Papal Empire (I assume he means the Holy Roman\nEmpire, he does not mention that\nto a large extent the temporal\npower of the Pope depended on\nthe in cum ban t Emperor and the\nsupport of the Hapsburg mon-archies. To also equate Islam and\nHitler's anti-semitic policies beggars\ndescription, it fully deserves the\nderision it must in cure. In the final analysis, Mr Newland's article is no more than the ramblings\nof one who aspires to literary\nmediocrity.\nYours sincerely\nStephen Goulder\nLife Sci 1\n2\n\n"

    "content": "CRICKET IC 1st XI\nIC 1st XI vs CHARING CROSS\nHOSPITAL\nImperial College 1st XI did little to\nrestore their dented pride after having\nlost at the weekend to Magdalen\nCollege, Oxford by 127 runs. With a stronger team, Neil Price won the toss,\nand chose to bat on a wicket that was\nneither conducive to batting yet\noffered little as s it ance to the bowlers.\nIC got off to a poor start losing their\nfirst wicket with only five minutes on\nthe board, but an excellent partnership\nbetween D Everett and J White began\nto heal the wounds and saw off the\nbest of the bowling until D Everett fell\nfor 23. As often happens when a partnership breaks up, J White lost his\nwicket to a shot he will not want to\nremember. Although we had now\nreached 60, time was slipping by and\nthe need for quick runs was apparent.\nThese were superbly supplied by Andy\nHarris who with Guy Simpkin put on\nthe biggest partnership of the innings\nof 60 runs, 42 of which were hit by\nAndy in 20 minutes, including 6 fours.\nWith tea imminent and with the need\nfor more runs, wickets fell quickly with\na valuable contribution of 20 from\nSam Seneviratne. The declaration\nmade at tea at 139-7 proved to be over\ngenerous and although Prasana\nD 'Silva took 3 for 31 and the bowling\nwas of a high standard only 3 an over\nwas needed. This soon increased to 5\ndue to tight bowling from M Ellacott\nand R Fefield and with very good\ncatches being taken. With only seven\novers left, 23 was hit off the first over\nand they had little trouble getting the\nrest. It was a much improved performance and IC should do well in the\nCup on Sunday.\nGuy Simpkin\nIC 1st XI vs Kingston Poly 1st XI\nHaving arrived at Harlington more\nthan an hour too early, Price withdrew\nhis team to a local hostelry to discuss\nthe afternoon's tactics. Suitably\nrefreshed, and inspired by talk of\nactually a winning a game, IC won the\ntoss and elected to bat.\nThe openers, White and Slator, were\ncruising to a large total when Slator\nwas caught with the score at 40. This\nbrought Simpkin to the wicket. He\nfaced one ball and returned whence\nhe came. Kenrick then spent twenty\nminutes avoiding scoring a run, and\nwas then given out.\nMeanwhile, White was scoring\nsteadily. Seneviratne joined White and\nwas soon tearing the bowling apart,\nbefore White was unfortunately run\nout for 67. Seneviratne continued his\nstylish play with Salter hacking at the\nbowling at the other end. Despite\nbeing dropped three times, Salter was\nout for 13. This left Price to come in,\nscore a run and then declare at 157\nfor 5 with Seneviratne 60 not out.\nEllacott, incensed by not being\nallowed to bat, opened the bowling\nwith his medium pace mediocrity. He\nmanaged to take two wickets for\neleven runs before being taken off by\nPrice and led away to the outfield. At\nthe other end, Silva, who was not\nbowling at his best, was replaced by\nthe dynamic Seneviratne who took one\nwicket. Price toiled without success at\nthe other end. Ratnam was brought\ninto the attack, but not even his naked\npace and nasty glares could capture a wicket. This was left to Simpkin, who,\nbowling his gentle daisy cutters, forced\nthe omnipresent Seneviratne to take\ntwo fine catches. Alas, time was not\non our side and at the close of play\nKingston Polytechnic were 121 for 5,\neven though the groin-stained Slator\nwas brought into the attack for the last\nfew overs.\nResult: a draw.\nVadid Ratios\nNOT CRICKET\nANTI-APARTHEID GROUP\nAn Imperial College Boat Club team has\nreturned from a tour of South Africa. It\nhas now been discovered that they have\noffered to lend a South African team their\nboat in order to row in the Henley regatta\nthis summer.\nThis would be using Imperial College\nUnion facilities to encourage sporting links with South Africa.\nThe Union has the right to control these facilities. The Anti-Apartheid Group calls on all opposed to apartheid to come along to the Annual General Meeting of\nICU on Tuesday 20th May at 1:00pm in\nthe Union Concert Hall and oppose this\nmisuse of our facilities.\nThe views expressed in this article are not\nnecessarily those of the Editor of FELIX\nSouth Africa is a racist state. In recent\nyears some cosmetic changes have been\nmade inside the country. Occasionally blacks play in white teams and vice versa\nand there is also some sporting fixtures\nbetween the four main racial groups. This\ndoes not change the essentially racist way\nsport is organised nor cannot in anyway\nbegin to change the vast imbalance in\nfacilities whereby the largest racial group\nreceives the most inadequate facilities.\nThe South African team at Henley will\nbe white. If we allow Imperial College to\nseem to support the presence of this\nteam it will be seen as a slap in the face\nfor the vast majority of South African people and as a show of support for the\nracist regime. The Anti-Apartheid Group at imperial College will continue to IC 2nd XI vs HOUNSLOW\nIC won the toss and elected to bat.\nThis decision looked dubious as the\nfirst three wickets fell for 17 runs;\nhowever, Nick Croft was in fine form\nand held the innings together with a fine 53, including six fours and a six.\nRedmond (15) and Salter (11) supported Craft and IC were 122 for 8 at\ntea. Confident of victory, Salter\ndeclared at this score. This left\nHounslow to get 123 runs off 40 overs.\nHounslow were 25 when their first\nwicket fell. A fine throw from Magness\non the cover-point boundary caught a batsman out of his ground. Redmond\nwas brought on to replace Sen and\ntook a wicket with his second ball.\nBowling his assorted leg cutters and\ndonkey droppers, Redmond took\nanother two wickets. Meanwhile, the\npace of the man-of-the-match Croft\ncaptured two wickets.\nWith twenty overs to go, Hounslow\nrequired only 55 runs for victory and\nthen 30 off the last ten overs. However,\nfine bowling by Croft and Ellis allowed\nHounslow only two runs off the last\nten overs \u2014 a remarkable feat. At the\nclose of play, Hounslow were 95 for 8\nand this most enjoyable match ended\nin a draw.\nAs a footnote, I should like to add\nthat the IC team set a record by\nstaying in the bar at Harlington longer\nthan the opposition!\nIdvad Ratios\nUL\nATHLETICS\nThe UL Championships and the trial\nfor the team to compete in the BUSF\nChampionships have been combined\ninto one event, which will be held at\nMotspur Park on Wednesday 21st May\nat 3:00pm.

    "content": "The True History of the\nELEPHANT MAN\nby M Havell\nThis book is concerned with Joseph Merrick who was afflicted by a progressive\ndisfiguring disease known as neuro fib roma to s is. Merrick was born in Leicester in 1860\nand his disease became apparent after the\nage of five years. After his mother died\nhis family broke up and he was forced to\nwork as a pedlar and then cigar-maker,\nuntil his disease rendered such work impossible. In mid-teen age, he spent four\nyears in a workhouse until he decided\nupon a career as a professional freak.\nManaged by Tom Norman, Merrick toured England; whilst on show in Whitechapel there came a chance encounter with William Treves, a doctor\nat a nearby hospital, who conducted an\u00bb\nexamination and gave Merrick his card.\nMerrick then went to Europe, only to be\nrobbed and left destitute; by an incredible\neffort he made his way back to London and to Treves.\nTreves, by now an eminent and respected doctor, placed him in an isolation ward staffed by volunteer nurses,\nwho had been prepared for Merrick' s, by now, gruesome sight. By advertisement in\nthe London Times the governors of the\nLondon Hospital, at which Merrick was\nstaying, raised enough funds to equip abasement beds it for Merrick. There it\nbecame fashionable for the rich and famous to visit him. His deformities, however, were worsening and he died in\nhis sleep during April of 1890.\nTo someone who has not read the book, it may appear gruesome, and in bad and Peter Ford\ntaste; however, there are valid reasons\nwhy it should have been written.\nThe hypocrisy of the Victorians is very\nevident. Shunned, forced into the squalor\nof the workhouse and subsequent freak-show performances, Merrick is an outcast\nin society; but when the patronage of\nMerrick became popular, he was held as\na prime example of Victorian philanthropy.\nMoreover, the close relationship that\ndevelops between Treves and Merrick is\na heart-warming one and by the end of\n\u2022 the book Treves appears almost saintly.\nMerrick, perhaps surprisingly, is un embittered about societies treatment during\nhis early life and, when living in the London Hospital is constantly thankful.\nNevertheless the book, I feel, fails to\ntake full advantage of its own potential in that it would have gone much more deeply into the sordid world of the freak-show. Also, in the centre of the book, there are some very nauseating photographs that perhaps add cheap journalistic\nsensation.\nThe book is a bit pricey for its size,\nretailing at \u00a36.95 in the Karn ac Bookshop, and can easily be read in an afternoon. One feels that, in some chapters particularly, the\nbook has been padded out with irrelevant\nfacts. Perhaps it is interesting to note that\nthe publishing of this book has coincided\nwith the production of a film about Merrick with one of the screens great sufferers, John Hurt in the leading role. Nevertheless the\nbook provides a good read and is a worthwhile purchase.\nAlan Goulder\nIC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\nConductor R Dickins 14th May Leader D Bogle\nDespite the TUC' s day of inaction, a few\npeople ventured into IC to hear the\nOrchestra on Wednesday night. Perhaps\nwe should gloss over the Beethoven First\nSymphony( the first piece always seems to\nsuffer) and start with the Grieg piano\nconcerto, in which the Orchestra played\nreally well in support of Richard Coker, an RCM graduate, who gave a flawless\nperformance. A few of the strings were out\nof key in places, but the brass entries were\nimpeccable.\nAfter the interval the first item was that\nwell-worn favourite of amateur orchestras,\nthe \" FolkSong Suite\" by Vaughan-Williams,\nwhich has some pretty tunes but not much else to recommend it. The final offering was\nKodaly's\"Hary Jan os\" suite, which begins\nwith an impressive\" sneeze\". The orchestration of this suite is rather\ncolourful, with prominent solos for horn, trumpet, violin and viola at various points,\nand includes a part for the cem bal on1 don't know if all Hungarian folk tunes sound the\nsame to me, but the first movement of this is\nvery reminiscent of the composer's\" Summer Evening\". Not counting cem bal on and piano, there were five percussionists\nand they were kept busy, especially in the\n\" Musical Clock\" piece. The last movement\nreally allowed the brass to \"let rip\" in a loud\nand exciting finale.\nDerrick Everett\nDear Colin,\nAs you have probably heard, last\nSaturday saw a very successful\n\"Bol .ck s to Ents\" Gig in the Union\nConcert Hall. We would like to take\nthe chance to thank all those who\nhelped us to put the gig together.\nFirstly, Jazz Club and SCAB for\nfinancial support; DRAMSOC and\nOPSOC for the stage and lighting;\nACME Disc Co. for the music; IC\nRadio for overall presentation; the\nbadge sellers and equipment movers;\nthe sweepers and mop per s who\nmade the hall respectable; Ents (??!!)\nwho lent us their PA/DISCO .... \"no\nhard feelings\"; finally, all the bands,\nwho played for next to nothing.\nBy the way, something in the order\nof \u00a370 was raised for Rag.\nCheers, SP3\nPete Hunt, Laurence Herbert, John\nRomer\nam REVIEWS ALL IS\nREVEALED Everyone who has been within a quarter\nof a mile of the Union Building on an evening will know of the existence of the\nJazz Club's rehearsal room( labelled, not\naltogether inaccurately, the noise room)\nbut only the favoured few have seen the\ndeeds committed therein. Until Saturday\nnight that was.\nThe\" Bollocks to Ents\" gig in the Union Concert Hall was an attempt to showcase\nsome of the bands existing in and around\nCollege, which have not appeared before\nin the Jazz Club/ Ents run of things, and as such was something of an experiment.\nI think Iam not alone in considering the\nexperiment successful.\nFirst up were the' Mystery Guests', who self-deprecatory manner suggested at\nall times that something was about to go\nwrong, and a few things did, but they\ncarried off the mainstay of their repertoire\n(solid electric blues) very well indeed.\nThe Ian Ritchie Quintet followed to give\nus some tight modern jazz and it was\nvery pleasing to see this go down well as\nthis is a do zy horse I, for one, have been\ntrying to flog in College for a while. All the players were extremely competent although I felt they did not really have\ntime to settle down and blow. But then\nI'm biased. Members of the audience with\n' Y' chromosone s will particularly remember their announcements.\nCliff Rescue and the Helicopters (where\ndo they get these names?) bounded onto\nstage next and proceeded to expend huge\namounts of energy entertaining us with all\nthe rabble rousing material at their disposal, from Gary Glitter to modified\nSex Pistols. Aska version of Paranoid\nwas particularly greeted for its perversity.\nPerhaps musical comment is inappropriate\nto a group whose main strength is in pure\nentertainment, but the backing vocals were so far off pitch to be really de tri mental. Good fun though.\nTopping the bill were SP3 who have\nbeen tread ng the t him line between the\n' jazz people' and the' rock people' in College for a couple of years now and who pleased some of both on Saturday\nnight. They suffered a bit from going on so late \u2014 some of the audience had gone\nto b eddy byes or been taken suddenly\ndrunk \u2014 and from following the He li copters who are not really an appetizer\nfor complicated, sometimes elusive music.\nThe performance was slick and obviously\nvery well rehearsed, but sounded muddy some of the time because of the lack of a well defined lead instrument.\nFinally, I would like to give ourselves a plug by saying \" Join the Jazz Club and instantly become a star\" and more seriously to thank Pete Hunt and Lawrence Herbert of SP3 who did a great\njo bin organising the whole venture. Except this review. Damn. John \"I 'll write anything for a fee\" Kotre\n9\n\n"

The spanking\nnew' lime' green van plus friend travelled uneventfully to Dartmoor whilst Tom and Matthew regaled the\npassengers with True Life stories from\nan appropriate magazine. Tents were\npitched in the boys' area (the mixed\narea was full \u2014 that'sour excuse anyway), kit sc rut in ee red and teams\nbriefed before we plunged back to\ntown for a visit to Mooney's Fish and\nChips Emporium. A local hostelry provided tables on which to decipher\nthe maps and we were all tucked into\nbed by Auntie Chris well before lights\nout.\nAwoken by the t annoy at 4:30, we\ncrawled out for cold porridge, scalding\ntea, runny scrambled eggs and edible\nsausages. Then it was packs on and\noff to join the other two and a half\nthousand people at the start for the\nTen Tors hymn, prayer and chat from\nthe Bishop and Mayor respectively. No going back now!\nWomens Report\nThe route (45 miles): Raw Tor; Steeperton Tor; Sittaford Tor; Huccaby Tor; Hart or Tor; Bear down; RoosT or; Lynch Tor; Dinger Tor; Sourton Tor.\nThe team: Tansy He pt on( leader); Mary Whit tam( navigator); Vicky Welsh; Karen Harget; Sally He slop; Sunil Nimalasuriya.\nWe started fast to avoid the rush at the\ncheckpoint at the top of the first tor\nand kept up good time despite the\nsecond tor living up to its name to\nsuch an extent that it turned into\nmore of a climb than a walk! Straight\non to S it ta ford while we were still\nfeeling good and then the pleasantest\nwalk along a riverside path going down to the southern part of the moor. Legs were beginning to ache by\nthis stage and a certain team leader\nbegan to get rather disheartened. However, a fairly long lunch break cheered everyone up with juicy oranges as the most welcome part. We\nknew our next tor would be tough \u2014\nbut didn't realise how bad until we had\nclimbed a really steep road to discover\na still-open pub enticing us! However,\nwe pressed on and, after asking the\nway twice (!) we found Hartor Tor and\nwere greeted with the cup final result.\nNo one is allowed to check through a tor after eight o 'clock so we had to\npress on fast. The next stretch (excuse\nthe pun) was mostly along the road to\nPrincetown and past the prison. This\nwas certainly the most gruelling part\nof the day with blisters, knees, ankles,\netc all objecting to strenuous road\nwalking. Bear down was reached at\n8:06 and, despite pleading with Imperial Opera is a new group formed\npredominantly from past members of\nImperial College Operatic Society, based\nin South Kensington. The aim of the\ngroup is to allow the talents and enthusiasm developed in the college\nsociety to be perpetuated once the\nmembers' student days are over. At the\nsame time, a wider repertoire of opera\nwill be attempted.\nLa Belle Helene will be Imperial Opera's first full-scale staged production\nalthough this follows a workshop and various fund-raising events in London and Devon, the Musical Director is\nMichael Withers and the Producer, Ian\nGledhill.\nofficials, we had to camp there. Blisters were attended to and supper\ncooked \u2014 well apart, I'm glad to say!\nA good night was passed although my\nsupper decided it had had enough and\ngot out while the going was good.\nAn early morning start saw us at our\nseventh tor by soon after eight in the\nmorning and another fairly flat stretch\ngot us to our eighth. Unfortunately it\nwas all rather high and our faces became rather wind damaged \u2014 to be\nfelt later. It was from here that our\nlack of navigational skill became apparent as we followed the wrong\nriver valley north. Once we realised\nthings weren't as they should be we\nknew that the safest thing would be to\nhead for the nearest manned tor, which we did. Here we discovered that\nwe. were nearly five miles out and had n't enough time to finish the course by 5:00pm, so very disappointed\n(but pretty glad to stop all the same)\nwe had to call a halt. The friendly\nsoldiers provided hot tea and 'orange\njuice' (with additives) and we were\ntaken back to camp by land rover having walked over forty miles \u2014 a great effort and proof that the training\nhad paid off.\nMen's Report\nThe route: Steeper tonT or; Sour ton Tor; Lynch Tor; Great Mis Tor; Hartor\nTor, Hawkes Tor, Sharp Tor, Muccaby\nTor; Sittaford To r;Oke Tor.\nThe team: Nick Last (leader); Andy Britton (navigator); MoM is r a;Tom Owen; Steve Hutchings; Matt Smith;\nAndy Smith (reserve).\nThis fifty-five mile route threw in\neverything Dartmoor could offer. The weather was hot and exceedingly windy which led to all of us either\ngetting tanned or sun-burnt. The first\ntor proved to be the most demanding\nmountaineering-wise' since, approaching from the north, we had to ascend\nthe steepest side \u2014 this had its effects\nOffenbach was one of the most prolific\ncomposers of operetta of all time, having written over a hundred of them.\nMusic flowed out of him like water from\na tap. He himself predicted that he would die with a tune on the end of his\npen, and indeed, he died in 1880, while\nstruggling to complete his Magnum Opus, The Tales of Hoffmann. 1980 is\nthus the centenary of his death, and it is\nappropriate that we should mark the\noccasion with a production of one of his\nbest and most popular works.\nLa Belle Hefene was first performed\nat the Theatre des Varietes in Paris\n1864. Its plot deals \u2014 loosely \u2014 with\nthe events leading up to the Trojan War.\nlater on. Having plodded a few more\nmiles we decided to have a break on Lynch \u2014 it was during the trek to this\ntor that a certain member (blush) felt\nas though he would die, but having\nsurvived, the team battled on having\npassed Dartmoor Prison (and a few\npubs \u2014 how cruel) we reached Hartor\nand were soon on our way to Hawkes.\nWe eventually found it 'hidden' behind\na huge clay works and left us two and\nhalf hours to r. each the next tor (since\nthey close at eight o 'clock). After a valiant effort following our inspiring\nleader, Nick Last, we found we needed\nat least another hour and so with\nexhaustion and hunger set tng in we\ncamped beneath the tor next to a river\nfor the night.\nThe food left much to be desired,\nalthough the cook literally put everything he had into it! The team, blistered,\nbut in good spirits pressed on, waking\nup at four in the morning and reaching\nthe tor at just past six. We then had\nthe toughest stretch of the expedition\n\u2014 a long nine mile, three hour walk\nwithout a break, to Hu cca by. This stretch certainly took its toll and some\nof the team members began to feel the\npace. Things began to drag, tempers\nbecame strained and when a certain M Smith decided to catch bees with his\nnet he almost became the subject of\nour pent-up feelings. Team spirits at\nthis point, I feel, bit a low and really\ndidn't pick up till we finished, greeted\nby a jubilant Mr Fox, Andy Smith and Tim Hillyer (the base camp crew) not\nto mention gold medals, certificate\nand a few can s of Swan( cheers, Chris).\nThe teams rejoined at Okehampton\n(the army camp and also the start and\nfinish of the expedition) to exchange\ntales and to commiserate with the girls\nwho put up a magnificent effort. Many\nthanks to all concerned especially the\ndrivers Tim and Chris and of course\nAndy Smith who like the girls were so\nnear yet so far.\nMo and Tansy\n\n"

The early start\nwas a bit much for many with\nCrowe, in particular, showing\nvery few signs of con cio us ness all day.\nSkipper Price won the toss\nwhich was the only good\nthing he did all day. IC\nbatted first. Everett (17) and\nWhite (53) got IC off to a. good start on a good wicket\nThis start to the innings\nmight not have been so\ngood if the opposition had\nheld on to one of the many\nchances the opening pair\noffered. Stantiford scored\ntwenty lucky runs but was\nput to shame by Simpkins\nwho has perfected the art of\nscoring runs off the edge.\nSimpkins and Turner saw IC\nthrough to lunch.\nTurner's lunch weighed\nheavily on his stomach and\nhe soon departed for six\nruns. Simpkins' run of luck\ncontinued until he reached\n53 when he lobbed a simple\ncatch to square leg. Fortunately Morton had arrived\non the scene and he showed\nhis true class rushing to a quick 50. Morton's modesty\nshowed through when he\ndeclined the opportunity of\nbeing outright top scorer\nand threw his cricket away\non 53 runs.\nThe tail ender s led by\nPrice never looked capable\nof scoring runs, but Price\nwas able to declare on the\nrespectable total of 230 for\n9.\nEllacott and Crowe were\ngiven the new ball. Neither\nseemed to know how to use\nit, but Ellacott picked up one\nwicket. Slator was quickly\nbrought into the attack and\nit is safe to say his bowling\nhas not improved since last\nyear. He bowled his usual\nfull tosses and long-hops but\nsneaked a wicket before tea.\nAfter tea Slator continued\nwith the same rubbish but\nactually took two wickets\nwith consecutive balls. He\nthen avoided a jug by not\ngoing for a catch off his own\nbowling on the hat-trick ball.\nEventually Churchill started\nto hit Slator all around the\nground and he was wisely\nremoved from the attack\nwith figures of 3 for 34.\nThis left Crowe (3 for 19)\nand Silva (1 for 16) to clean\nup the rabbits. Both bowlers\nare flattered by their figures.\nWith a run-out at the end,\nChurchill were dismissed for\n106, giving IC a convincing\nwin by 124 runs.\nThe first victory of the\nseason was celebrated in\nsuitable fashion.\nRock Mlnton\nTABLE TENNIS\n1979/80 Final Report\nIC 1st Team win Central\nLondon Trophy!\nDivision 4\nIC1 (P)20,(W)18,( L)256 pts.

As last\nyear we teamed-up with St Mary's College, Twickenham, added a few\npast masters of more mature years to\ndrive the minibuses, and the Impalas\nwere reborn.\nAt 5:00am on Thursday 24th April\nthe team assembled outside the Union\nand the minibuses headed for Dover\nto take the 8:30am ferry to Zeebrugge.\nThere followed the drive across\nBelgium and Holland to reach Nijmegen. The yellow minibuses went all\nthe way at a stately 40mph with the\nblue van in hot pursuit. Nijmegen was\nreached at 7:30pm and we were too\nlate for our first Dutch Mooney. Not all\nwas lost and we persuaded the race\norganisers to pay for a trip to a local\nhamburger joint, complete with Knickerbocker Glory. We also met our hostess,\nEllen Brahens who had looked after us\nso well last year.\nThe race itself is a twenty-five stage\nrelay starting at midnight on Friday in\nNijmegen, passing into Germany and\nfinishing at 5:00pm on Saturday in the\ngrounds of the polytechnic at Enschede.\nSix of the stages are for ladies and there\nare two restarts during the race in\norder to keep the field together. Of the\none hundred and fifty teams competing,\nfourteen were foreign, including\nSurrey, the only other British team,\nGermans, Swedes and for the first\ntime a Polish team (who seemed to be\nsubject to a no frater ni sing edict).\nLast year the Impalas were seventh\nand despite being short of three\nrunners were looking to do well again\nand were, as ever, intent on thrashing\nSurrey. On the first two stages Dawn\nand Alan got the team off to a fine\nstart and by the end of the third stage\nwe had taken the lead four minutes\nahead of their nearest rivals Surrey,\ndespite the appalling weather con-ditions. Throughout the night this\nadvantage was extended until the\ntenth stage when Delft, the eventual\nwinners, took the lead, but third team\nSurrey were over eight minutes down.\nDuring the morning stages, Delft\nwent further ahead and Surrey made a little ground until after eighteen stages\nthey were only three minutes adrift.\nThe shortage of runners meant that\nthree of the team had to race for a second time during the afternoon.\nDespite this we opened up our lead\nover Surrey again and although Delft\nwere by now un catch able the Impalas\nheld second place with some fine\nrunning and a brave Surrey made it a British double by finishing third.\nThe whole team ran superbly with*\nmost people finishing in the top ten on\ntheir stage. A special mention for\nLouise Barnes who became the first\nImpala to win a stage outright, and\ncame back to record a very fast third\nplace on stage 22. Martin O 'Halloran\ncame second on the longest stage and\nbounced back to run well on the final\nleg, and Bryan Acford, who despite\nhaving no sleep ran twice, recorded\nthe second fastest time on both\noccasions.\nFollowing the race there was a massive party in the unus ally designed\nunion building which seemed to go\npretty well; however, the writer's recollections are somewhat blurred on\nthis point.\nFor the return journey on Sunday\nthe yellow minibus was once again in\nless than perfect health and cruised\nup the hills on the M2 in first gear. We\nfinally reached London at 2:30am on\nMonday.\nStill when twenty-two bodies fell\nonto the pavement outside the Union,\nall were of one mind. The Impalas will\nbe back next year and aiming to go\none place better!\nL Hayler\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Colin,\nIn reply to the letters which\ncondemned the counter-demon-st rations outside the Iranian\nEmbassy, I would like to clarify\ncertain points.\nThere were various issues at stake\nduring the demonstrations, when\nthere should only have been one; the\nsafety of the hostages inside the\nEmbassy. That would certainly justify\na demonstration by Iranians\nconcerned about their fellow\ncountrymen/women's well being.\nInstead of seeing banners reading\n\"Let our people go\" or similar\nrelevant slogans, one was met by\nprotestors chanting im motive phrases such as \"Death to Carter\",\n\"Death to Thatcher\", marching\nround and holding up insulting\ncaricatures of President Carter.\nIt is difficult to see how that would\nhave helped the hostages inside the\nDear Sir,\nAs is to be expected, last week's FELIX displayed a typical anti-British\nbias. Your attitude appears to be that\nif it's foreign it's great. Stuff it.\nYou've gone further this time T note.\nNot only are you anti-British, you're\nalso anti-Civiiisation. This is to be\nunderstood, since it is the official ICU\npublication. I would however remind\nyou that, in spite of ICU's efforts,\nLondon is still the official and actual\ncapital of the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. I would mention a few points. Firstly\nthat it is typical of the hypocrisy to be\nexpected that it should be demanded\nthat foreign students should be freely\nallowed to come here .... provided\nthey are not from South Africa. In\nwhat way does South Africa differ\nfrom Russia? Both oppress certain\nsectors of the population - and SA is a damn sight free er than the USSR.\nSecondly, the outstanding triumph of\nthe British security forces in coping\nwith foreign feuding has conveniently\nbeen ignored. Without their efforts\nLondon and this country in general\nwould be far less safe than it is.\nThirdly your Editorial and\ncontributors have taken the side of\nthe Iranians. Why? Can you so easily\noverlook the illegal holding of some\nfifty innocent foreigners by the\ngovernment in that country. And can\nyou so easily forget the executions of\nhundreds of people for their services\nto the previous government. The\nDear Colin\nSurfacing from exams at last,\nand read ng your appeal for amusing\narticles in the FELIX last week, I thought, well \u2014 why not? When I read the article entitled \" The American-Iranian Conflict; Some\nHistorical Perspectives' I could see\nwhy not.\nIf you were short of articles\nduring the revision period, then I do sym pathis e, but I'm afraid that\nyou might have considered the\npompous and patronising parable (I can do alliteration too, you see)\nmerited a whole page. It wasn't really so radically revelation ary to\nbe revered, was it? (Anything you\ncan do . . .)\nI think that the piece might have\nbeen better entitled 'Some Personal\nHistorical Perspectives' \u2014 when\nreading the FELIX, Justin, ones\nEmbassy, instead it simply\nproliferated anti-Iranian feeling\namongst the British onlookers, be it\njustified or not. Similarly, by holding\nup pictures of Khomeini and showing\nsupport for him, the situation was\nbeing turned into a political forum,\nand naturally attracted demonstrators opposed to the Ayatollah for\nhis policy of condoning the holding of\nthe American hostages in Teheran.\nStupid and unruly behaviour by\ncounter-demonstrators deserves no\npraise, but it is not for those there (A sickened IC student) hoping for\npolitical gain to criticise that\nbehaviour, as they themselves\nwere being publically insulting to the\nWest, when their sole concern\nshould have-been for the safety of\nthose held hostage in the Embassy.\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Chamberlain\ntrials these people have received are\nsurely an example of the philosophy\nof the government, that is to say that\nanyone they don't like is guilty unless\nproved innocent. And if they're\ninnocent then you try the judge for\ncrimes against the state. Any western\ncountry carrying out this practice\nwould be instantly condemned by all\nthe press, including FELIX, but\nbecause it concerns Iran it is\nacceptable. Give me the SAS, and\nSPG, or even the Mafia, rather than\nthe Iranian Justice.\nThirdly, remember, if Carter had\nsucceeded he would be regarded as\nthe greatest hero ever. Admittedly\nthe plan displayed the typical\ninefficiencies and cock-ups expected\nof the USA. However, it is unfair to\nslate him so mercilessly. He was\nunlucky. Don't forget, if it had been\nthe USSR Embassy, Iran would not\nexist by now.\nFourthly, as long as it effects sport,\nany outrage against any foreign\ncountry is allowed by the USSR.\nAfter all, we can't stop \"our lads\"\nfrom going to Moscow. Who cares\nabout Jews, Dissidents, Religion,\nAfghanistan, Communism, we've got\nto win the medals. - Musn't go to SA\n'though, must we? Congrats to\nRCS for their demo, Congrats to the\ncoppers and SAS also, com miss e rations to Carter & the US. Stuff\nICU.\nYours,\nDisgusted of Mech Eng.\ndoes not appreciate being lectured\nat \u2014 we get more than enough of\nthat all week. The article was not\nproperly reasoned, was c irc um loc u tory and most irritating of all, I have some suspicion that Mr\nNewland sits in his room after he\nhas written a thing like this and\nimagines that we are all pouring\nover our dictionaries with unmitigated fer v our while we try to\ndecipher the writings of the man\nwho sees all so clearly.\nI was interested to read your\nopinions, Mr Newland, but, glad as\na I am that we have such a pragmatic spokesman at IC, a man of\nsuch vision as yourself \u2014 I do\nobject to reading such a patronising\nand opinionated article.\nI could have done without you to\ntell me why I feel \"astonishment\nand indignation\" at the events in\nDear Colin,\nIt was with mounting concern I read the letter from Andy Nicolaou,\nCarolin Temple-Bird, Ian Hodgson,\nA Gujral, K Pratt and J Czernuszka.\nTheir letter will spark off an indignant\nprotest from the fanatical \"anti-Ayatollah\" demonstrators themselves, however unlike, to the\nbest of my knowledge, the co-writers\nof this letter, I actually watched both\ndemonstrations for a period of\nseveral hours on the first day and\nabout one on the second day and\nhave a different point to make.\nHow such a group of articulate and\nintelligent students can produce\nsuch a misleading and pompous\nletter, implying so much, and submit\nto a serious newspaper is beyond me.\nMany of us will remember a letter\nfrom one of the above co-writers in\nFELIX Issue 534 (Nov 161979) which\nwas a personal attack on Steve\nHutchings for suggesting that his\nphotos should be credited. The\nwriter admitted he knew nothing\nabout the legal, arts it ic and copyright\nreasons involved and had never even\nmet Steve Hutchings but felt he could\ncall him a \"Power Mad Prat\" and\nfinished with a typically pompous\nending that if Steve didn't mend his\nways \"what hope for the world?\"\nComparison between the two\nletters reveals a striking similarity.\nThe writers seemed to have learnt\nnot to come straight out with an\nadmission \"that they don't know\nwhat they are talking about\" but from\nsubsequent comments that seem to\nbe inspired from inna curate press\nreports and the assumption anything\nI was remotely near would be a farce.\nThe last paragraph \"Are these really\nthe kind of people who\", etc, etc is\nmore subtle but still worthy of that\nprevious ending \"If not what hope for\nthe world\" etc.\nI saw fellow students from IC on\nboth sides. Many Iranian students\ndemonstrated their obviously deeply\nfelt support for their religious and\npolitical God, the Ayatollah\nKhomeini, with afer v our that was\nfanatical.\nOne of their earliest spokesmen\nwas from Chem Eng. While I respect\ntheir strongly held religious beliefs as\nI expect they respect mine, I fail to\nunderstand their politics or\nrevolution and consider many\npublished statements to be\nhy pp critical in the extreme. I can't condone the action of their\ngovernment(s) which have not only\nflouted the Declaration of Human\nRights which we have adopted but\nevery diplomatic code. However, I'm still prepared to fight for the right\nof free expr e sion in the UK, but they\nseemed prepared to die for their\nIran, and quite apart from that,\nneither of those feelings could\ntruthfully be attributed to what I think about it anyway. I am very\nsurprised that the whole thing\nwasn't printed on purple to go with\nthe prose; it didn't really require\nsuch a load of old cobblers (English\nderivation, Justin, meaning rubbish,\nsupply any expletives you wish) to\ntell me that \"religion is a clear\nprotagonist\" in the struggle \u2014\npossessed of superb political insight\nand historical hindsight \u2014 I might\nhave guessed.\nI'm sorry, but the whole article\nbeliefs. Their letter ignored this\nprotest.\nThere were fanatical \"anti-Ayatollah\" demonstrators, but I think that most of the IC students\nwere there because they disagreed\nwith the amazing \"double-think\" of\nthe Iranian Demonstrators who\nsupport their own political hostage-taking but were calling for the\nexecution of 91 sympathisers of the\nPrinces Gate Gunmen as retaliation\nfor someone else's political hostage-,\ntaking. In my opinion they chose the\nbest way to do this, not to confront\nfellow students with in fl amatory confrontation but object to their\npolicies not to the people who were\ndeeply committed to their cause.\nCheerful and un f rienzi ed ridicule of\nconflicting attitudes has been an\naccepted part of British Politics for\nover 100 years (listen to Parliament,\nor ead political cartoons). I have no\nidea what the original organisers\nwere intending, however, as I do not\nKnow them.\nMaybe the writers would have\npreferred them to put forward policy\nat UGMs, hand leaflets out etc, most\nof the demonstrators however are\nnot as active in the Union\nunfortunately as the writers. The\nletter goes on to imply some kind of\n\"top level\" communication with\nthemselves and the Police & Home\nOffice enabling them to comment on\ntheir opinion. It goes on to say that\nbecause Young Skinheads turned up\nthe next day it was all a mistake, this\nis like winding up London Transport\nbecause people write on the seats.\nI know my own prejudices and try\nto compensate for them, but I have\nnothing but respect for the Iranian\nstudents and their commit t ment though I think their attitudes are\nfoolish. Maybe I'm wrong, perhaps\nthey will try and put me right. THe co-writers seem unable to recognise\ntheir own prejudices, they\ni mme diu at ely assume the worst,\ntrivial, and shallowest of motives\nfrom the majority of \"boring,\nconventional, and less articulate\"\nstudents.\nI know that I am not \"tragically\nindifferent to events in Iran\" but if\nSouth Kensington is to become a World Stage we should try to have\nserious and objective letters in\nFELIX. The letter attacking Steve\nHutchings was appalling enough, but\nto apply the same standards as\npompous and pretentious.\nIgnorance to such serious subjects\nbetrays a different sort of \"tragic\nindifference to events going on in\nIran.\"\nYours very sincerely,\nFrancis Rowsell BE1\nwas built up from arguments as\nflimsy as your insight into the\nproblem. I could criticise the whole\nthing, but this is not the place for it\n\u2014 I probably wouldn't have written\nat afl if this article had been a first\nfrom Mr Newland, but this is the\nthird time I 've read this sort of \u2014\nwait for it \u2014 opinionated, pompous,\ninflated, ponderous, tautological\nverbal ten es mus from him, I felt\ncompelled to reply (in the same\nvein, of course!).\nYours sincerely\nAnn-Marie Tomsett\nBiochemistry 3\n4\n\n"

Sandra O 'Sullivan was the only candidate for the\npost of President and so won the election. However, in a speech to the meeting she said that in her opinion ICWA\nhas failed. Sandra said that she would not get rid of\nICWA but would just make it clear to the girls at IC how\nlittle ICWA does for them.\nSandra said that she would not sit on any committees\nand this could lead to an attempt by other members of\nICWA to remove her from the position. This\nyear's President said, \"It's just a bit red icu lou s but all the\nrest of the committee are very keen - we will continue\nanyway. It doesn't matter about the President.\" \"\nLast years ICU President, Mary Attenborough, joked\nthat she might as well stand for Chairman of the\nConservative Society. (Mary is known for her political\na ff il at ions to political groups other than the\nConservatives and if she was elected CONS OC chairman she considered that it would be equally\nred icu lou s). Roger Stotesbury commented that Sandra\nwas the only candidate, who stood in the ICWA\nelections,who actually bothered to come to the meeting.\n\"It just shows that ICWA cannot survive if there is no\ninterest,\" he said.\nRCS AGM Last Tuesday's RCS Annual General Meeting managed to elect an Assistant\nHonorary Secretary, JaneL avers, and ratified the folio wing posts: Ents Chairman \u2014\nDave Thompson; Publicity Officer \u2014\nCaroline God in.

    "content": "IC WIND ENSEMBLE CONCERT11 th May\nConductor D Edwards\nThe annual 1812 Overture concert\nis now something which most\npeople in College look forward to\nand everyone hears. A large crowd\ngathered in the sunshine on the\nQueens lawn to hear the Wind\nBand, many with picnic lunches, a few with tablecloths, and at least\none ice-bucket. The band began\nwith Finlandia by Sibelius, a rousing piece which was given a really vigorous performance. The\nWind Band version of this piece is\nas exciting as the full orchestra\nscore, although the brass instruments don't seem able to play the\nscales as fast as the strings, so this\nversion goes a little slower. Then\nthere was a complete change of\nmood, with Scott Joplin's The\nEntertainer and a medley called\nInstant Concert (or something) in\nwhich the audience could play\n'spot the tune'. I lost count.\nNext we came to the big one,\nThe 1812 Overture, with everything\nexcept strings and chorus. Some of\nthe tempi were a bit suspect and\nthe bass line could have been\nstronger, but at least there were\nenough bell-ringers for this perform-ance. Most of the cannon fired\nsucces fully, and produced a louder\nbang than Kensington has heard\nfor at least a week.\nInstead of finishing with the 1812,\nwhich would have been the obvious\nprogramme order, the Wind Band\nended with Elgar's4 th Pomp And\nCircumstance March. If they'd played the first of these, I'm sure\nmost of the audience would have\nsung along. A good patriotic note\nto end on.\nSiege through the eyes of a camera - by Mickie Marsh\n11:40am go for a pint. Wonder\nwhat all these police are doing\nabout here. Suppose there may\nhave been another Lybian shot.\n12:35pm Colin says someone's been shot at the Iranian Embassy\nincluding some policemen. So off I rush to Linstead and collect my\ncamera gear and a couple of rolls\nof film Arriving at a police cordon\nat 12:35 I ask what has happened.\nThe reply was, \"Don't know, mate.\nWe think it's a siege.\" When I ask\nwhere I can get some information,\nI'm told to go round to the press\nenclosure. The rest is history; six\nor seven gunmen had held up the\nEmbassy staff and a diplomatic\npatrol police officer.\nGiven the situation, what could I do only armed with a camera, a few lenses and a FELIX 'press pass?\nAlmost straight away we had a semi press conference where we\nwere told there were two or\npossibly three gunmen holding\nhostages and making demands. We\nwere not allowed to ask any\nquestions.\nPeople were being evacuated\nfrom Princes Gate, including a girls' school next door but one to\nthe Embassy. Some of the girls\nwere obviously quite shocked. A NBC reporter interviewed two of\nthe girls for US television.\nIt was obvious that around the front\nnothing much is going to happen,\nso I try to go round the back. On\nthe top of the swimming pool a decent view is to be had, though\nafter ten minutes we are moved on.\nTry Weeks Hall, but the Chief of\nSecurity won't let me in with a camera, even though I'm from\nFELIX. Next try Garden Hall, via\nIC Radio entrance, thanks to Dave\nFuller. Inside we get quite a good\nview of the gardens behind the\nEmbassy. There is a lot of police\nactivity both on the ground and on\nthe roofs. The view was ideal, then\nwe heard about the twelve noon\ndeadline, when they claimed that\nthe Embassy would be blown up.\nI 've got to have my camera in\nGarden Hall. Then I 'll leave it with\na friend and come in early in the\nmorning.\nMeanwhile outside the Embassy,\nIranian protesters wer beginning to\narrive.\nEarly evening saw people offer\nthemselves as hostages, then the\nprayer sessions began.\nWednesday night saw my plans\nchange as North Side Princess\nGardens was being policed. The\ncamera had to go in before morning\nas I did. A friend from. Garden\nHall agreed to help me 'smuggle' it\nin. After a few lost heart beats we\nwere in.\nWe were awake by eight giving\nus four hours to wait to see if the\nterrorists blew it up. Come 11:45\nwe were evacuated \u2014 nothing hap-pen ed, but if it did I was ready for\nWeeks Hall to fall.\nThe afternoon saw Barney entertain the crowds with a full repertoire of some of his better known\nsongs, including Rule Britannia,\nEntertainer with a few national\nanthems thrown in.\nFriday saw an 'official' AntiAyatollah march from Mech Eng\nwith a full prayer session to follow.\nSaturday \u2014 the Rag Fete Day\nheralded the opening of the Queens\nTower and an excellent view of the\nEmbassy. There was, however, not\nmuch activity on the roof. The\nprotesters were dwindling in\nnumbers and by Sunday they were\nalmost gone.\nMonday (and I should have been\ndrag racing) the police moved into\nthe Linstead Hall canteen feeding\ntwo hundred at a time with non-Mooney food, ie, of good quality.\nAbout 3:00pm we heard shots,\nbut no news. At 7:20pm I was told\nof ambulances in Exhibition Road.\nUpon seeing eight and making my\nway back to Linstead Hall an\nominous boom was heard \u2014 the\nend had begun.\nNo way could I get into Weeks\nor Garden Hall. So I went up on to\nLinstead roof, but couldn't see\nanything.\nA brief trip onto Elec Eng roof\ngave an excellent view. There were\nbits of burnt paper blowing all\nabout with a lot of smoke, then the\nflames began to show. Within half\nan hour the building was well\nablaze.\nBy 9:00pm it was virtually all \"\nover. After a good think, I decided to sell some pictures to\nsome daily newspapers. (The fire\nhadn't been too good from the\nfront.)\nAfter a few phone calls and one\nrefusal from The Times. The Sun\nsaid to bring the roll of film down.\nBy 11:30pm the prints were ready\n\u2014 which they accepted.\nAfter a good night's sleep, and a good reading of the Sun they were\nnowhere to be found.\n\n"
