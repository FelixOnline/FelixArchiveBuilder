What\u2019s a replacement to consoles?\nGAMES\nAnthony Onwuli\nGames Editor\nC\nonsole generations have been\nmarked with\ngamers dropping\nover \u00a3300-\u00a3400 on a new\nconsole, \u00a350 on new titles,\nand more recently \u00a360 a\nyear to play their games\nonline. But what if the\nfuture of the next generation required no consoles,\nno fancy rigs nor any\nneed to pay to access the\nboradband your already\npaying for?\nThe entertainment\nindustryhasmostlymoved\naway from physical media\nand has embraced digital\ndownloads and with the\nadvent of platforms such\nas Spotify and Netflix.\nConsumers no longer need\nto \u201cown\u201d media in order to\nenjoy music and movies.\nAn unlimited selection\nof titles is now what the\naverage person expects.\nBut can gaming become\nthe next industry to be\nembraced by streaming?\nShort answer: Yes. Long\nanswer: It\u2019s complicated.\nCloud Gaming\nNow subscrip-tion-based models for\naccess to a large library\nof video game titles\nis nothing new for the\nindustry. The idea of a\ncloud gaming service is\nalready a decade old. It\nhas been trialled, tested,\nreleased, a bit of success\nbefore ultimately failing.\nThis gaming achievement\nwas unlocked by OnLive.\ndistribution. It worked for\nSpotify and it worked for\nNetflix. The service, to\nthe surprise of video game\nsceptics, worked!\nSo where is OnLive\nnow? A myriad of\nbusiness issues behind the\nscenes ultimately led to\nOnLive becoming defunct\nin April 2015 with Sony\nacquiring its patents. It\nwas a service which was\nahead of its time.\nPlayStation Now\nSony, then also\nequipped with Gaikai,\n(a rival of OnLive in the\nearly 2010s), had been\nmaking great advances\nin cloud based gaming\nwith the PSP and PS Vita\nallowing Remote Play\n(a method of streaming)\nwith the PS3 and PS4.\nSony had introduced\nits digital video game\nsubscription service with\nPlayStation Now in 2015\non PlayStation 4 and PC.\nThis has given gamers\naccess to over 500 Playstation titles for \u00a312.99\nper month. This service in\nsome aspects represents\nthe \u201cNetflix of gaming\u201d\nnarrative. But it\u2019s requirements of downloads now\ncombined with it being\ntargeted at a pre-existing\nmarket of gamers does not\nembrace what OnLive set\nout to do.\nGoogle Stadia\nInitially conceptualised\nas Project Stream, the\nStadia was unveiled at\nGame Developers Conference (GDC) in March\n2019. The Stadia aims\nto embrace the Netflix\narhcitecture for media as\nOnLive did during its era.\nThis is Google\u2019s first step\ninto the games industry,\nand it is definitely a bold\nmove.\nThe heavy processing\nthat was previously tied to\nexpensive gaming rigs and\nconsoles using Google\u2019s\ninfrastructure. Claims of\n10.7 teraflops of power\nhave cited for cloud computers which make light\nwork of the Xbox One X\u2019s\n6.0 teraflops.\nStadia is designed to\nrun simply through the\nGoogle Chrome browser.\nNothing else is needed\nbesides a controller.\nAlphabet also owns\nYouTube, so it should\nbe no surprise that the\nmassive video sharing\nplatform will be used\nto enhance the Stadia\nexperience. You could be\nwatching a trailer for a\ngame which is currently\nout, and if it\u2019s available on\nthe Stadia, then you could\nbe playing it instantly.\nProject xCloud, Apple\nArcade and Tencent Start.\nThe future of cloud based\ngaming is certainly up in\nthe air. The Stadia is a\ncool concept, but Google\nis certainly not an originator in this field.\nVerdict?\nThe chief marketing\nofficer of Xbox, Mike\nNichols, has claimed that\nGoogle might struggle to\ncompete as they \u201cdon\u2019t\nhave the content\u201d. which\nis a valid claim. We still\nhave much to learn about\nthe Stadia including its\nunknown game library,\nunknown price, and the\ndependence on your\ninternet connection.\nThough with improving\nbroadband speeds as well\nas the 5G rollout, this\nissue going into 2020\ncould be prevented from\nbeing the Achille\u2019s Heel\nof Google Stadia.\nThe Google Stadia will\nrelease towards the end\nof 2019. Who knows,\nwe might have Google\nappearing at E3 this year.\nGoogle\u2019s Stadia aims to make gaming accessible across all your smart devices // Google\nISSUE 1720\n\u201cSubscriptions\nbased models\nfor access to a\nlarge library\nof video\ngame titles is\nnothing new to\nthe industry\u201d\nThe First Attempt\nWhat exactly was\nOnLive? It was a cloud\ngaming service which\nenabled its subscribers to\nrent video games without\nhaving to install games\non their device. All the\nrendering for the games\nhappened on remote\nservers and the fully\nrendered game would be\nsent to your device. No\nlonger would you need to\ndedicate your 1TB hard\ndrive to 500GB of video\ngames and DLC. Gamers\ncould rejoice at this revolutionary concept. There\nwould have been no need\nto build expensive PC rigs\nand the appeal of an easier\ndistribution platform\nwould have surely pulled\ndevelopers and publishers\nto this new method of\n\u201cStadia is a\ncool concept,\nbut Google is\ncertainly not\nan originator\nin this field\u201d\nWith a large community\nof streamers on YouTube,\nGoogle can easily incorporate the average watcher\ninto a gamer with Stadia\u2019s\n\u201cCrowd Play\u201d feature\nwhich will allow players\nto jump into the same\ngame as their favourite\nstreamer and even join\ntheir multiplayer session.\nGoogle\u2019s not the only\ntech giant entering the\ngame industry. Rival\ntechnology companies\nMicrosoft, Apple and\nTencent all have their own\nprojects in the works with\nThe next generation of gaming might not be defined by consoles, but by a \u201cNetflix\u201d approach to your gaming\nlibrary.\n\n"

The most painful\npart about this season\nfrom hell - the worst\nseason I've ever had to\nendure in living memory - is that my team is\nabsolutely not involved.\nWe've been reduced to\nmere spectators. Matters\nof Europe and the top\nfour are really none of\nmy concern. I might as\nwell be a West Ham sup-porter, there's nothing to\nplay for. These are tough\ntimes to be a United fan.\nI might resume my football boycott. The NBA\nplayoffs are looking\nparticularly exciting.\nI've always heard good\nthings about cricket.\nApparently golf is really\nhotting up these days,\nwhat's Tiger up to?\nAnyway, on to more\nserious matters. This\nweek's lead story is a very\ninteresting one, regarding\na member of the Senior\nManagement at College\nand her concerningTwitter\n2\nactivity surrounding the\ntransgender community.\nAlthough I appreciate\nCollege's response and the\nmatter seems to have been\nresolved amicably, I can't\nhelp but be left slightly\nfrustrated. I understand\nthat College must tow the\npolitical line at all times,\nbut there are times when\nI wish they would take a\nfirmer stance on matters\nas pressing as these. A\nmore complete condemnation of transphobia\nwould only serve to\nensure that members of\nthe transgender community feel better supported\nby Imperial. This logic\ncan be extended to any\nmargianalised community\nat Imperial, which finds\nhateful rhetoric justified\nunder the guise of \"free\nspeech\" and \"defending\ndebate\". My problem with\nthis is that it gives both\nsides of the discussion\nequal weighting, despite\nthe fact that both sides\naren't equally affected by\nthe discussion at hand.\nHaving said this, I would\nalso say that progress has\nbeen made and this is a\nsource of encouragement\nfor all concerned.\nThis week's Section of\nthe Week, goes to the Arts\nsection!

A titan in\nthe world of oil and gas,\nwhose pulse is closely\nmonitored by financial\nmarkets as a proxy to the\nhealth of one the world\u2019s\nfavourite commodities,\nSaudi Aramco has raised\n$12bn from the $100bn\nreceived in orders, the\nlargest amount ever seen\nin an emerging market\nbond deal. Investment\nbanks JP Morgan and\nMorgan Stanley were the\njoint global coordinators\nfor the deal,\nOn April 10th, 2019,\nthe secretive state-backed\ncorporation released a\n469-page prospectus,\ngiving investors a glimpse\ninto the finances of the\noil giant, which have\npreviously been kept\nsecret for three-quarters of\nthe century. The numbers\nconfirmed rumours of the\ncorporation\u2019s profitability.\nThe year of 2018 brought\nin a net income of\n$111.1bn, dwarfing that\nof rival Royal Dutch Shell\nfive-fold and double that\nof Apple, leading some\ncashflows standing at 4.5\n\u00d7 larger than gross debt.\nMost energy rivals have\na ratio of less than 1.\nThe issuance follows the\nCrown Prince\u2019s desire for\nAramco to take on a larger\npresence in the global\nfinancial markets and\nleverage its robust balance\nsheet to fuel the PIF. An\neagerly awaited initial\npublic offering (IPO) of a\n5% stake in Aramco was\ndelayed indefinitely last\nyear, after disagreements\nsurrounding its $2tn\nvaluation. The IPO would\nhave seen $100bn flowing\ninto the PIF\u2019s coffers.With\nthe kingdom still reeling\nfrom controversy over the\nkilling of journalist Jamal\nKhashoggi, an article\nby the Financial Times\nconsidered the political\nimplications of the deal,\nframing it as a way for the\nkingdom to reingratiate\nitself with global\ninvestors. This comes at a\ntime when global scrutiny\nof some of the kingdoms\nmore controversial actions\n, which have left allies and\ninvestors nervous, is at a\nhigh.\nAramco\u2019s financial\nhealth, low debt to\ncash flows, geographic\nadvantage and market\nleading position has\nearned it credit worthiness\nratings of A1 and A+ by\nrating agencies Moody\u2019s\nand Fitch respectively,\nfalling short of the\ncoveted triple AAA rating\nawarded to the highest\nquality of debt issuers. An\nentity\u2019s credit worthiness\ndetermines the likelihood\nof the debtor defaulting on\nthe loan obligation, i.e.,\nthe likelihood of Aramco\nbeing unable to repay\nthe holders of its bonds.\nThe reason being, the\ncorporation\u2019s close ties\nwith the sovereign and\nthe government\u2019s reliance\non oil taxes to fund its\nexpenditure. Despite the\nimpressive net income,\nFinancial Times reported\na profit of $26/barrel for\nAramco (after deducting\nnew sites to tout it as the\nworld\u2019s most profitable\ncompany.\nThe proceeds from\nthe bond issuance will\nfund Aramco\u2019s recent\npurchase of a majority\nstake in Sabic, a local\npetrochemicals company\nfrom the Saudi Arabian\nPublic Investment Fund\n(PIF). The transaction\nrepresents a 70% majority\nstake that is worth $69bn.\nAs Aramco has a refining\nand petrochemical\nproduct line, this aligns\nthe strategies and interest\ns of 2 major players in the\nsector.

The\nprevious MCU entries\nhave always felt slightly\ninconsequential, because\nwe can always expect\nan Avenger or two to\npop up again in a future\ninstalment. However,\nEndgame, for the first\ntime in the history of the\nMCU, has to convey a\nsense of finality. It has to\nprovide a conclusion to\nthe sprawling storylines\nand characters the MCU\nintroduced, especially\nfor the first batch of\nAvengers, who we have\ngrown to love and cherish;\nand I find Endgame\u2019s\nconclusion very satisfying\nand well executed, with\nmultiple character arcs\ntying up organically and\nelegantly.\n\u201cEndgame, for\nthe first time\nin the history\nof the MCU,\nhas to convey\na sense of\nfinality\u201d\n\u201cAfter finishing\nEndgame,\nthere are still\nno words that\ncan adequately\nencapsulate\nthe shock and\nbeauty\u201d\napparently a film made by\nfans for fans. However,\nthe entirety of the second\nact feels too much like a\npiece of fan-fiction. It is\ndefinitely fun to watch,\nbut it is executed rather\ntoo carelessly.\nThe last act, however,\nmade all the wait worth\nit, and dwarfs all the\nshortcomings of the film.\nHours after finishing\nEndgame, there are still no\nwords that can adequately\nencapsulate the shock\nand beauty of the third\nact. It completely demolishes and obliterates the\nmeaning of \u201cawesome\u201d.\nIt was beyond anyone\u2019s\nexpectation. No one\nasked for it, yet the Russo\nBrothers delivered none-theless.

    "content": "Air pollution in London: where are we now?\nSCIENCE\nJuan Ignacio Rubio\nPolitics Editor\nI\nt is not an exaggeration to say that\npollution is one of\nLondon\u2019s biggest\nchallenges for the foreseeable future. While it\nis true that the situation\nis not as concerning as\n70 years ago, when the\npea soup-like Great Smog\nkilled 4000 people in less\nthan a week, the current\npollution cloud that floats\nover the capital is still a\nmajor health hazard for\nall Londoners, especially\nthe youngest and oldest\ncitizens. In anticipation\nof the 20th\nMay speaking\nevent on the matter, organised by the Times and\nImperial College London,\nI will present to the Felix\nreaders an objective account of the present state\nof the problem.\nWhen the media talks\nabout air pollution, a\nmajority of us imagine a\nbleak landscape of black\nfumes coming from a\nmultitude of factories.\nIndeed, pollution is\ncaused by the emission of\ntoxic substances resulting\nfrom human activity. But\nwhat are those substances\nexactly, and why are they\nharmful for us and the\nenvironment?\nThe causes of the and Strand recording\nthe highest amounts. In\n2013, it was estimated\nthat vehicle engines were\nresponsible for half of\nall emissions of NO2\ninto\nLondon, much more than\naviation and industry,\nwhich accounted for 7%\neach.Thus, it is imperative\nto tackle the problem of\nvehicle emissions in order\nto solve this public health\ncrisis. This is the point\nwhere we meet a term that\nhas become quite familiar\nin the last month: ULEZ.\nThe measures taken\nCentral London Congestion Charge of \u00a311.50 is\napplied on top of that.\nWhile it may sound harsh,\nand indeed there has been\nsome protesting over the\nmatter, 70% of Londoners approve the current\nmeasures, and a similar\namount would like further\nrestrictions.\nA glimpse of hope\nIt is extremely early to\nevaluate the effect that\nthe ULEZ has had on the\noverall pollution levels\nof London, but there is\nencouraging research that\nshows the less extensive\nregulations implemented\nsince 2010 have been\nsomewhat successful in\nimproving the quality of\nair. Total NO2\nemissions\nhave fallen by 9% since\n2013 and no breaches of\nthe annual pollution levels\nallowed by European\ndirectives have occurred\nin 2019 so far.\nIf you want to learn\nmore about the problem,\nattend the seminar hosted\nat Imperial on 20th\nMay,\nwhere you will be able to\nIf you want to learn more about the problem, attend the seminar hosted at Imperial in\nSAF G16 at 5pm on 20th\nMay // The Times\nISSUE 1720\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nproblem\nThe three big bad boys\nmost responsible for the\ncurrent sad state of the\nair quality in our city are\nnitrogen dioxide (NO2\n),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2\n)\nand carbon monoxide\n(CO). NO2\ncomes from\nthe combination of the\nnitric oxide (NO) emitted\nby heating and engines in\nvehicles with the oxygen\npresent in the air; SO2\nis\na by-product of the combustion of coal, oil and\ngas, which contain small\namounts of sulphur, and\nCO is the main product of\nsaid combustion when it\nis done under conditions\nwhere the concentration of\noxygen is low. The health\neffects resulting from prolonged exposition to them\ninclude higher chances\nof developing chronic\nrespiratory diseases,\nseveral types of cancer\nand overall reduced life\nexpectancy. It is estimated\nthat 4000 Londoners had\nto be hospitalised due to\nthe ill effects of pollution\non their health between\nthe years 2014 and 2016,\na quarter of them being\nchildren under the age of\n14. 600,000 Londoners\nsuffer from asthma, a condition that is worsened by\nhigh levels of air pollution\nIn 2016, the annual\nmean levels of NO2\nconcentrations in 59 of\n97 air monitoring sites in\nLondon were over the UK\nlegal limit, with Brixton\nRoad, Oxford Street\nto tackle it\nWhile several initiatives have been implemented for the last couple\nof decades by both the\nMayor and the London\nboroughs in the hopes of\nimproving the air quality\nof the city (e.g. promotion\nof the bike as a mean of\ntransportation, Congestion Charge for vehicles\nin Central London\nbetween 7am and 6pm on\nweekdays), the recently\nimplemented Ultra Low\nEmission Zone (ULEZ) is\nby far the most ambitious\npolicy adopted by the\nlocal administration to\ndate. Currently covering\nthe West End, Bankside,\nthe City and parts of the\nEast End, the ULEZ will\nbe extended to the North\nand South Circular Roads\nin 2023, thus including\nmore than 3.8 million\npeople under its reach.\nThe scheme is very\nsimilar to the Central\nLondon Congestion\nCharge started in 2003,\nbut it now operates 24\nhours a day, seven days\na week. Drivers of polluting vehicles (i.e. those\nthat do not comply with\nthe European emission\nstandards in their respective categories) need to\npay \u00a312.50 per day for\ndriving within the zone,\nor \u00a3100 if they are driving\nheavier vehicles like\nlorries or coaches. The\nForget Brexit: What is being\nignored?\nAt the next event, The Times will launch a competition to give one Imperial student the chance\nto write for Red Box, The Times\u2019award-winning\npolitical newsletter, once a month for a three\nmonth period. The winner will also meet Matt\nChorley, the editor of Red Box, to find out what\nit\u2019s like working in Westminster.\nFull details of how to enter will be announced\nMay 20th\nbut, if you\u2019re interested, start thinking\nabout what are the issues which are important\nto you that are being overlooked while politicians are distracted by Brexit? What is the one\nlaw you would pass if you were prime minister\nfor the day? What is happening in health, educa-tion, housing, employment, welfare, the envi-ronment, transport, the arts, sport and family\nlife? And what will be the long-term impact on\nBritain if the problems are not tackled soon?\nask questions to some of\nthe biggest experts in the\narea.\nPollution is one of London\u2019s biggest challenges // Guardian\n\n"

Needless to say,\nit was one of the most\ndevastating hours of\nmy entire easter holiday\n(really putting revision\ninto perspective). Hosted\nby the trusted veteran, sir\nDavid Attenborough, this\ndocumentary presented\nthe alarming and formidable consequences of\nglobal warming exceeding\n1.5 degrees.\nThe problem with\nglobal warming for\nmany, is that it seems to\nbe such an abstract and\noverwhelming topic that\nwe can\u2019t quite get the\ngrasp of it. There seems\nto be too much information floating around,\nwith mixed opinions and\nsolutions from a multitude\nof angles. Nonetheless,\nyounger generations have\nshown strong concerns\nand proactivity in the\nrecent months, through\nevents such as the\nclimate strikes across the\nglobe and the extinction\nrebellion in London. It\nseems timely that BBC\nhas broadcasted this comprehensive documentary,\n\u2018rousing call to arms\u2019, as\nstated by the Guardian.\nIt tackles some of the\ngreatest threats of climate\nchange - heatwaves in\nforests that have led to the\nmassacre of the Australian\nflying fox; icebergs built\nover thousands of years\ncollapsing in a matter of\nseconds; regions of land\nonce inhabited now sub-merged, forcing \u2018climate\nrefugees\u2019 to seek escape;\nwildfires in California\nburning down entire\ncommunities along with\nits families.\nOur planet is quite\nliterally falling apart.\nI believe that the\nproblem with us as\nstudents studying in\nLondon, living our day\nto day lives, is that it\nbecomes almost too easy\nto dismiss everything\nhappening thousands of\nmiles away. If we aren\u2019t\nthe ones suffering, we\nseem to continue putting\nit off. Which is why, this\ndocumentary is so painful\nto watch \u2013 but should be\nmandatory for everyone.\nSir Attenborough\u2019s dire\ntone presents shocking\nstatistics about the reality\nof our planet, which,\nnarrated over footage of\ngrim landscapes taken\nfrom across the globe,\nmerge in an effort to cry\nout to our ethos, pathos\nand logos. When the\ndocumentary presents\nto you the stark reality\nof real people and tragic\nclimate change.\nNonetheless, the film is\nnot all doom-and-gloom.\nThe last 20 minutes of\nthe documentary offers\na glimpse of hope: if we\ntake serious action in the\ncoming years it is possible\nto mitigate some of the\nmost adverse damages\nof climate change. By\nshedding light on 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and\nhow she ignited a youth\nrevolution against climate\nchange, we as audience\nare urged to believe that if\nshe can do it, any one of us\ncan too make a difference.\nAn interesting\napproach to the problem\nis presented through the\nrapid growth of renewable\nenergy development \u2013\nsolar panels, windmills,\nand even electronic aeroplanes (though far in the\nfuture).

With\nthe 200-year anniversary\nof the births of Queen\nVictoria and Prince Albert\nfast approaching, this\nyear the festival will be\na collaborative effort for\nthe first time. 19 other\ncultural institutions in\nthe area, all of which are\nmembers of the Exhibiton\nRoad Cultural Group,\nhave come together with\nImperial to bring The\nGreat Exhibition Road\nFestival 2019.\n\"We're very lucky on\nthis campus to have such\na unique position where\nthere's the world's leading\nmuseums on the road\",\nsaid Vicky Brightman,\nspeaking to Felix. In her\nposition as Head of Public\nEngagement, Vicky looks\nafter the festival and is\nparticularly concerned\nwith areas around how\nImperial can engage the\nwider society with its\nresearch and also how\nImperial can enable its\nstaff and students to do\nmore and better public en-gagement. Explaining the\nidea behind the festival,\nVicky said, \"let's have a\nthink about how we can\nwork collaboratively to\nraise the profile of the\narea to lots of new audiences because it is a really\nspecial area - the home\nof arts and sciences in\nthe UK really, especially\nLondon.\"\nThe festival, which\nis planned for 28th\n- 30th\nJune and will see vehicular access to Exhibition\nRoad blocked due to\nit being closed off, is\npartly inspired by The\nGreat Exhibition of 1851.\nPrince Albert championed\nthis and wanted to have\nan exhibition to show the\nworld how advanced we\nwere. Six million people,\nan astonishing number at\nthe time, visited this first\nexhibition and the profits\nare still administered by\nThe Royal Commission\nfor the Great Exhibition of\n1851, one of the partners\nfor this year's festival.\n\"200 years on, we thought\nit was a great opportunity\nto celebrate that vision\nAlbert had\", Vicky added.\nThat vision being, if we\nwere to fuse the arts and\nsciences and collaborated,\neverything would be a lot\nbetter and richer for it. At\na time when people were\nstill thinking that there\nwas a rift between arts and\nscience, Prince Albert was\nquite the visionary and his\ndesire to see the profits\nof the exhibition used to\nfund this area ('Albertop-olis') is why many of the\npartnered institutions are\nhere today. Vicky told\nFelix: \"What was really\nimportant to everybody\nwas showing what the\nrichness of collaboration\ncan bring\".\nThe festival is also\nabout attracting new au-diences. Imperial, along\nwith many of the partnered\nmuseums, is aware that\nsometimes it is \"preaching\nto the converted\" - i.e.\npeople that already love\nscience or the arts. Vicky\naddressed this, saying:\n\"We want to keep those\npeople coming because\nthey might study and\nwork in the area as well\nand that's really important\nbut, actually, there's loads\nof local communities that\ndon't see this as the place\nfor them. One of the other\nmain aims of the festival\nwas to work a bit harder\non community engage-ment. We're particularly\ntrying to engage people in\nNorth Kensington.\" As a\nresult, there are five or six\ncommunity engagement\nprojects taking place\nbefore the festival that\nwill have an output at the\nfestival which can be celebrated much more widely.\nAs well as working\nhard on community en-gagement, all the partners\nare really excited about\nengaging eachother's au-diences. Commenting on\nthis, Vicky added: \"The\npeople who come to our\nImperial Festival aren't\nthe same as those that go\nNEWS\nAndy Djaba\nDeputy Editor\n19 other cultural institutions in the area have come together with Imperial to bring\nThe Great Exhibition Road Festival 2019 // Imperial College London\nto the V&A [Victoria &\nAlbert Museum]. We want\nto engage a really wide\nvariety of people with our\nresearch and involve them\nin it so working in partnership gives us access\nto lots more people that\nperhaps wouldn't come to\nthe Imperial Festival and\nwe'd never reach\".\nOf course, the logistics\nof collaborating with 19\ncultural partners imposes\nsome contraints on flexibility and has resulted in\na date change to Imperial\nFestival, which typically\ntakes place in April/ May,\nas reported in last week's\nissue of Felix. Vicky\nrevealed: \"Finding a date\nthat everybody would be\nhappy with was a very\nchallenging aspect. The\ndate certainly wasn't\nperfect for us.\" With that\nbeing said, College has\ndone a commendable job\nat ensuring the number\nof students affected is\nquite low. In response\nto students that are concerned or confused about\nthe changes, particularly\nthose that have to move\nout of student halls early,\ncompared to previous\nyears, Vicky said: \"I'd\nask them to look at the\nNicky Bradley performing at the Imperial Festival // Imperial College London\nFelix sat down\nwith Head of Public\nEngagement, Vicky\nBrightman, to get\nthe scoop on The\nGreat Exhibition Road\nFestival 2019\nFAQs as a first point-of-call. All the Hall wardens\nhave been informed and\nthey know what to do if\nsomebody comes to them\nso tell someone, whether\nit's your lecturer or a\nHall warden. The Student\nHub and various Campus\nServices teams have been\namazing. Our students\nare so important for the\nfestival.\"\nThe importance of\nthe student body to the\nsmooth running of the\nfestival can't be stressed\nenough, with at least 200\nstaff and student volunteers each year. There are\n140 research teams taking\npart in the festival, therefore postgraduate students\nare especially crucial.\n\"Those research teams are\nalways a mixture of staff\nand student; they deliver\nso much of the content.\"\nVicky noted: \"There\naren't many opportunities\nwhere everybody comes\ntogether and feels like\nthey're all part of the same\ninstitution and the same\nteam\". However, this close\ncollaboration between\nstaff and students at the\nfestival engenders a sense\nof community seldom\noffered at Imperial.\n\n"

Specifically, we are writing to you about your previous following of Transgender Trend (@Transgendertrd) and others on Twitter and\nyour engagement with some tweets which claim that provision of life-saving support and healthcare for trans children and teenagers is tantamount to\nabuse. Over the last month we have been communicating with you about our concerns, and are reassured that you have heard them and that the College\nis taking them seriously.\nFor trans students and staff within the Imperial College community these issues are important to address with immense care, as it impacts their ability\nto be open at work without fear of harassment, bullying, and harm.\nIn recognition of these challenges, the College Policy is significantly in support of trans individuals and makes the pledge\u201cThe College believes that,\nas a leading institution, it will benefit from employing trans people at all levels of responsibility, thus providing role models for staff and students who\nidentify as trans.\u201dFurthermore, the policy continues to state that there is a\u201cPublic Sector Equality Duty\u201dwhich\u201cgives public bodies legal responsibilities\nto take proactive measures to address equality.\u201dAs a senior figure within the college, it is likely that members of the college will look up to you and see\nyou as a role model, and therefore to be in line with this policy it is important that you aim to act as an ally for the trans community.\nWe urge you to recognise that many members of the Imperial College community have deeply personal experiences with their gender. For many\nstudents, university presents the first opportunity for them to be themselves. The 2016 APS Climate in Physics Report addressed the impact on trans\nresearchersandfound\u201c30%oftransindividuals[...]characterizedtheoverallclimateoftheirdepartmentordivisionasuncomfortableorveryuncomfortable.\u201d\nand for trans individuals 60% had observed and 50% had experienced exclusionary behaviour.We must work to create an inclusive community for all our\nmembers, understanding the difficulties they face.\nWe understand you have unfollowed these accounts and appreciate the words of support you have expressed in meetings. We urge you and the\ncollege to publicly respond to the large number of students who have expressed concern over this issue and commit to further supporting the trans\ncommunity at Imperial College.\nWe object to groups like Transgender Trend because their conception of equality excludes the most marginalised. We hope that as a member of the\nCollege community you can continue to work with members of the LGBT+ community and their allies within college to support trans-inclusive feminism.\nYours,\nJosef Willsher\nSTATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO LETTER\nProf Simone Buitendijk and Prof Stephen Curry have confirmed their full support for trans students and staff and their commitment to working\ntogether and maintaining an open dialogue on these issues. This follows productive discussions between Prof Buitendijk, Prof Curry and representatives\nof the student and staff LGBT+ community. The meeting came after concerns were raised by students and staff about some social media accounts that\nProf Buitendijk was following and some engagement with these accounts.\nProfessor Buitendijk said:\u201cAlthough I support the freedom of academics to follow and engage in debate in all areas, including on social media, on this\noccasion I now realise that social media is not the correct forum for such sensitive debates. I have elected to stop all engagement with these accounts\nand apologise for hurt or anxiety caused to members of our community. I fully support all trans staff and students and I hope that the open and honest\ndiscussion we have had can lead to improved collaboration to ensure a sense of safety and belonging for all trans students at Imperial.\u201d\nProfessor Curry, Assistant Provost (Equality, Diversity & Inclusion), said:\u201cI am determined to help create a diverse and inclusive environment at Imperial\nwhere all staff and students feel free to be themselves and all members of our community are free to express their views. We must uphold both the\nindividual rights of all our members of our community and also the importance of universities remaining places of open and respectful debate. I was\npleased that members of the LGBT+ community felt able to raise their concerns; the ensuing discussion was very constructive and provided a valuable\nreminder of the need to be mindful of the power dynamics in any form of public discourse.\u201d\nImperial College London is committed to equality and diversity, including the active support and inclusion of trans people in our community. We are\npleased that a significant body of students has expressed support for the trans community in response to this issue.\nOne of the offending tweets in question // Twitter: @SEBuitendijk\nNEWS\n(cont.)\nFollowing this, Josef\nengaged academics and\nstaff in the Physics LGBT\nRepresentation Network\nand, with the support\nof academics, staff and\nother co-signatories,\nstarted writing the letter\naddressing their collective\nconcerns to Professor\nBuitendijk.\n\u201cThere's\na pattern\nof lots of\naccounts, lots\nof likes, lots of\nengagement\nwith things\nthat we\nconsider\ntransphobic\u201d\nProfessor Buitendijk\nhas since apologised,\ndeleted the offending\ntweets and unfollowed the\naccounts in question.\nThe issue was particularly sensitive because\nmany of the posts with\nwhich Professor Buitendijk had engaged were\nTERF-related. TERF,\nor Trans Exclusionary\nRadical Feminist, is a\ncategory of feminism\nwhich \"seeks to exclude\ntrans women\". Josef\nexplained to Felix: \"Lots\nof trans women we've\nspoken to about this\nare very aware of how\ndamaging that sort of\nrhetoric can be. It's a\nreally harmful debate to\nbe having and unfortunately it's dominated the\npublic discussion about\ntrans rights in the UK.\"\nIn addition to the\nPhysics LGBT Representation Network,\nmany of the letter's\nco-signatories are from\nImperial 600, the College's LGBTQ+ network\nfor staff and postgraduate\nstudents, IQ, Imperial's\nLGBTQ+ society, as well\nas Imperial's political so-cieties, including Labour\nSociety and Left Forum.\nEarly drafts of the letter\nwere leaked to College\nManagement and an\ninitial meeting was held\non 16th\nApril between\nProfessor Buitendijk,\nProfessor Stephen Curry\n[Imperial's Vice Provost\n(Equality, Diversity and\nInclusion)] and those who\nhad expressed concern.\nThis meeting has been\ndescribed by some as\n\"very political\". Although\ndebate on campus is to be\nsupported, Josef shared,\n\"we were trying to explain\nto them how LGBT people\nand trans people are very\nsensitive to this cry for\nboth sides because both\nsides means supporting\nand also condemning your\nactual identity\". There\nhas since been another\nmeeting, held on 29th\nApril, and both College\nand those concerned have\nagreed a suitable resolution to the issue.\n\u201cProfessor\nBuitendijk\nhas since\napologised,\ndeleted the\noffending\ntweets and\nunfollowed\nthe accounts in\nquestion\u201d\nFelix approached\nProfessor Buitendijk for\na response to staff and\nstudents' calls for her\nto distance herself from\nthe offending tweets and\nre-confirm her commitment to inclusivity and\ndiversity, to which she\nreplied: \"Yes, I want to\ndo that. The last thing I\nwant is to cause anxiety\nor harm. That is, of\ncourse, absolutely not my\nintention. I've apologised\nabout any potential or real\nharm and anxiety that I've\ncaused and I really understand now, much better\nthan before, the dangers of\nhaving these kind of very\ncomplicated exchanges\nof opinions of Twitter.\nI've totally taken a step\nback from all of that and\nwe're hoping that we can\ncontinue the conversation\nand work with Imperial\n600 to make sure that we\ndo right. I'm hoping that\nwe can use this as a good\nway of mobing forward.\nI'm hoping we can do\nsomething together so\n\u201cSimone\nrepresents\nCollege\nManagement\nand College\nManagement\nhas an\nobligation to\nprotect trans\npeople\u201d\nwe're not seen as being at\nodds with eachother.\"\nThe staff and students'\nletter to Professor Buitendijk and the College's\nstatement in response can\nboth be seen overleaf.\n\u201cI've\napologised\nabout any\npotential or\nreal harm and\nanxiety that\nI've caused\u201d\nJosef ended the discussion with Felix by noting:\n\"Simone represents\nCollege Management and\nCollege Management has\nan obligation to protect\ntrans people and has an\nobligation to support\nthem. Using her public\nTwitter account to engage\nwith tweets and to share\narticles... we really didn't\nthink it's the place to do\nthat. A respectful debate,\nif you want to have that,\nmeans something else.\"\n\n"

As\nthe dramatic\nmusic of\nAlso Sprach Zarathustra\nthunders in the back-ground, the psychedelic\nhexagonal carpet from The\nShining rolls underfoot.\nWe enter a bright corridor of screens, Stanley\nKubrick\u2019s most iconic\nscenes flashing by as we\nget closer and closer to the\nmain screen itself. It\u2019s a\nhomage to the beautifully\nsymmetrical one-point\nperspective used in his\ncinematic shots, but also\ngives the strong sense\nof being, quite literally,\nsucked into Kubrick\u2019s\nworld of film-making.\nA fitting start to this\nnew exhibition marking\nthe 20th anniversary of\nthe filmmaker\u2019s death.\nPrepare to be wholly\nimmersed in what went on\nin that brilliant mind - the\nmind that gave us some\nof the most unforgettable,\ngenre-defining films of\nour time.\nA single wood-panelled\nroom awaits us. Loosely\norganised, it\u2019s a bit like a\ncabinet of curiosities with\nKubrick paraphernalia\neverywhere. The director\u2019s chair sits proudly in\na corner; one of his many\nAcademy Awards is displayed nearby, alongside\nSasco cards annotated\nby Kubrick himself and\na letter from Audrey\nHepburn. Original screenplays and scripts are exhibited in the centre of the\nroom, each rumpled with\nuse and scribbled over\nwith handwritten notes\nin Kubrick\u2019s own hand.\nIt\u2019s exciting to see his\nmarks all over the source\nmaterial: some dialogue\nlines resolutely crossed\nout, others underlined and\nemphasised with an exclamation mark or two, and\nlittle storyboard sketches\nin the blank spaces.\nOriginal costume and\nset design sketches litter\nthe walls, alongside\nscouting photographs\ntaken in search of the ideal\nshooting locations. It\u2019s\nlike a behind-the-scenes\ntour of the director\u2019s\nmind. It\u2019s easy to see his\nfamed perfectionism,\nattention to detail and the\nsheer amount of preparation that went into each of\nhis films. For Napoleon, a\nfilm on the French general\nKubrick planned but never\ncompleted, rows of historical books on Napoleon\nwhich fill a shelf on one\nside of the room - and that\nwas just the pre-reading.\nKubrick was well-by Kubrick to shoot low-light candlelit scenes in\nhis period drama Barry\nLyndon. And, of course,\nthe famous centrifuge set\nused to model the spaceship Discovery in 2001:\nA Space Odyssey; taking\n6 months and \u00a3580,000\nto build, it enabled the\ncreation of the futuristi-cally continuous spaceship interior, one living\nspace merging seamlessly\nwith the next in a gigantic\ntreadmill. Never one to\nbe satisfied with current\ntechnology, Kubrick was\nalways looking to use\nnew techniques and new\ntechnology to achieve the\neffects he wanted. Also on\ndisplay is the novel slit-scan photography used by\nDoug Trumbull to achieve\nthe psychedelic light\neffects of the final \u2018Star\nGate\u2019 sequence, representing a journey through\nspace and time. While\nsomething we might take\nfor granted now with\nthe advent of CGI, this\nmind-bending light show\nwas made entirely without\ncomputer effects and\noffered audiences something that had never been\nseen before in film.\nThe second, meatier\npart of the exhibition goes\ninto the making of each\nof his films in glorious\ndetail. The most famous\nscenes from each film are\nprojected on large screens\nfor viewers to get a taste\nof the finished product.\nEach section is rich with\nproduction photographs,\noriginal storyboard\nsketches and concept art,\nwith iconic set pieces\nand costumes from each\nfilm on full display. There\nare some real gems here.\nAmong these are Private\nJoker\u2019s helmet from Full\nMetal Jacket, the slogan\n\u201cBorn To Kill\u201d scrawled\nacross it right next to a\npeace sign pin; the photoshoot of 14-year-old\nSue Lyon, star of Lolita,\nstaring provocatively\nover her heart-shaped\nsunglasses; Sir Kenneth\nAdam\u2019s concept sketches\nfor the War Room in Dr\nStrangelove, described by\nSpielberg as the \u2018finest set\never designed\u2019. Important\nwork from other contributors to Kubrick\u2019s films is\nwell-acknowledged, from\nthe graphic design of Saul\nBass or Philip Castle to\nMilena Canonero\u2019s beautiful costumes designed\nfor Barry Lyndon.\nThe curators have also\ngone to the trouble to\nshowcase both the things\nthat might have influenced Kubrick and also\nthe impact his films had\non society. Don McCullin\u2019s haunting photographs\nof the Vietnam War are\nprominently displayed\nin the section devoted to\nFull Metal Jacket, a film\nabout the brutal impact of\nthe Vietnam War on both\nsoldiers and civilians.\nMeanwhile, a series of\nirate letters from the\npublic capture the controversy stirred up by the\nviolence of A Clockwork\nOrange and the sexual-isation of a teenage girl\ndescribed in Lolita. There\nare also fascinating tidbits\nabout the creative process\nbehind each film. For\nEyes Wide Open, Kubrick\nhad to shoot a story based\nin NYC on the streets of\nLondon - his meticulous\ninsistence on authenticity led him to have his\nassistant painstakingly\nphotograph the whole\nof Commercial Street,\none photo at a time, on a\n12-foot ladder.\nThe exhibition ends,\nfittingly, with his most\nfamous and technically\nchallenging work, 2001:\nA Space Odyssey. It was\nthe genre-defining film\nthat would shape the\nway we thought about\nfuturism and science\nfiction forever. Capturing\nthe sense of space exploration and futurism of the\ntime, Kubrick\u2019s 2001:\nA Space Odyssey was a\nrealistic view of a plausible future, predicting\niPads and current worries\nabout sentient artificial\nintelligence. Kubrick and\nhis team imagined this\npossible future in stunning\ndetail, ranging from\ntechnical consultations\nwith IBM for the design\nof intelligent computer\nHAL-9000, right down\nto the furniture, watches,\nclothing and even cutlery\nused in his vision of 2001.\nOn display here, though\nnot included in the film, is\neven an intriguing range\nof \u2018futuristic makeup\nproducts\u2019 envisioned by\ncosmetics giant Coty for\nuse by the ladies of 2001.\nIt was characteristic\nof Kubrick, perhaps, to\ncraft whole new worlds\nfor each of his films,\nalthough only part of\nthem would ever be seen\nby audiences. While this\nmade him set punishingly\nhigh standards for his\nstaff and chosen actors\n- there\u2019s a bit in the exhibition about how he made\nTom Cruise walk through\na door 90 times for Eyes\nWide Shut - it also gave\nhim the \u2018magic\u2019he looked\nfor in front of his camera,\nand which filtered down\nto us as audiences. There\ncertainly is something\nmagical about watching\na Kubrick film. Whether\nhorror, science fiction,\nwar film or even historical\ndrama, he elevated every\ngenre he ever turned his\nhand to, without losing\nhis distinctive style.\nThe thing about magic\nis that it can\u2019t be ex-plained. But the Design\nMuseum\u2019s breathtaking\nretrospective gives a\nglimpse of what went on\ninside the head of this\neccentric, influential and\ngroundbreaking director.\nAn exhibition that will\nsatisfy even the most\nhardcore Kubrick fan, and\nleave you with a strange\ndesire to watch all his\nfilms in one sitting.\nDelve into the brilliant mind of one of the world\u2019s most revolutionary filmmakers.\nStep inside to discover a world of pure imagination // Design Museum\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

The songs\ncreated great breaks in\nthe action, and whilst this\nmay not have been the\nright play for diehard fans\nof the Bard, it was perfect\nfor anyone who wants\nto ease themselves into\nShakespeare, or doesn\u2019t\nusually enjoy it so much.\nSet on a cruise liner in\nthe 20s, the stage design\nwas simple yet fabulous.\nThe small upper section of\nthe Rose Playhouse was\nused for the entire play,\nwith the audience seated\namongst all the action. It\naptly mimicked the deck\nof the SS Illyria, so I\napplaud Simon Nicholas\nfor an incredibly clever\nuse of the space. The\njazz band performed in\namongst us, sometimes at\nthe back and sometimes in\nthe middle on the stage,\nmaking the feel like a\nreally immersive experi-ence.\nI have never seen such\nan imaginative interpretation of a play, and I never\nwould have guessed it\nwould work.The cast were\nexcellent, many of them\nalso playing instruments.\nFeste, played by Hannah\nFrancis-Baker definitely\nstood out to me, aside\nfrom acting and playing\nthe trumpet, her stage\npresence and liveliness\nwhilst singing (probably\nthe best voice out of the\ncast) really pushed the\nshow forward. Viola,\nplayed by Lucy Crick,\nwas also wonderful in her\nrole, though I must admit\nI was less taken with her\nsinging; perhaps it was\nbecause her voice wasn\u2019t\nas suited to the style of\nmusic. The rest of the\ncast were also hilarious,\nin particular Sir Andrew,\nplayed by James Douglas.\nFaith Turner as a female\nversion of Malvolio, here\ndubbed Malvolia, was also\na stand out performance\nas the snooty, disapproving right-hand woman\nto Olivia. She ends the\nplay singing a beautiful\nsong, giving the ending a\nbit of a sad, unexpected\ntwist which I\u2019d never seen\nbefore.\nOne of my only qualms\nwould be that some\nsongs didn\u2019t fit with the\nstoryline. Whilst it was\nlovely to hear fun jazz\nrenditions of catchy songs\nthat we all knew the\nwords to, from classics\nlike Creep by Radiohead,\nto chart hits from Jason\nDerulo, a few of them just\ndidn\u2019t feel like they made\nsense in the context of the\nplay. On the other hand,\npresumably not everyone\nwas paying as much un-required attention to the\nlyrics as I was, but rather\njust enjoying the live\nmusic!\nThis is definitely the\nplay to see if you\u2019re\nlooking for a very inventive and original version\nof a classic play, be that\nbecause you want to get\ninto Shakespeare but\ndon\u2019t know where to start,\nor you just enjoy quirky\nsmall productions by\ngroups of talented underrated people.\nT\nhe Picture of\nDorian Gray\nis one of\nOscar Wilde\u2019s\nbest-known works,\nand certainly the most\ncontroversial. Published\nin 1890, it immediately\nattracted criticism for the\nhedonism and immorality\npromulgated in its pages,\nwith Wilde accused of\n\u2018offending public morals\u2019.\nThe story is of Dorian\nGray, a beautiful young\nman who, influenced by\nthe rich and sybaritic Lord\nHenry, comes to the pursuit of pleasure as the only\nimportant things in life.\nRashly, he wishes that a\npainting of him at the peak\nof his youth would age,\nwith he himself staying\nunchanged forever. His\nwish is fulfilled; despite\nhis spiral into corruption,\nhe remains young and\nbeautiful, the portrait\nalone becoming the\nwindow onto his wicked\nsoul.\nTilted Wig Productions\u2019\nnew adaptation, directed\nby S\u00e9an Aydon, makes a\nbrave stab at capturing\nthe complexity of Dorian\nGray for the stage. While\ncertainly a solid produc-tion, Aydon\u2019s direction\ncomes across as a bit too\none-dimensional, missing\nout on the emotional subtleties and inner turmoil of\nWilde\u2019s original Dorian.\nPerhaps this is also in\npart due to Gavin Fowler\u2019s\nportrayal. Fowler never\nreally seems to comfortably inhabit the character of\nDorian. Excessively full\nof naivete in the begin-ning, he does a complete\n360 into some sort of\nmachisimo-fuelled sexual\npredator without so much\nas an interval between.\nWith \u2018good Dorian\u2019 and\n\u2018evil Dorian\u2019played rather\nlike caricatures, there\u2019s\nlittle explanation for why\nthe \u2018unspoilt young man\u2019\nsuddenly turns into a\ncold-hearted, degenerate\ncad at what seems to be\nAlso worth noting is\nPhoebe Pryce for her\nimperious, cool-as-a-cu-cumber portrayal of Lady\nVictoria Wotton, though\nher stage time was sadly\nlimited.\nAll 19 scenes take place\nin Sarah Beaton\u2019s delightfully eerie set \u2013 the high,\ncracked, paint-peeling\nwalls of an artist\u2019s studio\nappropriately capturing\nthe themes of rot and\ndecay. With no real set\nchanges for any of the\nscenes, it gets a little static,\nbut changes in lighting\nwork well to convey the\nright atmosphere.\nThe production does\nsuffer a little from a taste\nfor melodrama, which\nrather detracts from the\nplot. Midway through,\njust to hammer home\nthe point about Dorian\u2019s\ndescent into depravity,\nLord Henry and Dorian go\noff to a Killing Kittens-esque sex orgy. The lights\nstart flashing red, various\nmasked, leather-clad\npeople gyrate to thumping\nmusic and to top it all off,\nLord Henry starts injecting heroin in the corner. I\ncouldn\u2019t help but giggle.\nThe titular picture is\nrepresented by a clear\npane of plastic, which\nreappears as slightly\ncracked and opaque after\nDorian\u2019s misdeeds. I\nfound this visually under-whelming \u2013 nowhere near\nvile and horrible enough\nto represent Dorian\u2019s\ncorrupt soul or to justify\nhis horrified reaction\nat the end of the play.\nDorian\u2019s death, despite\nthe flashing backlights\nand his melodramatically\ncollapsing silhouette, ultimately falls short in actual\ndramatic impact.\nAvisually pleasing production that doesn\u2019t quite\ngive us the wittiness and\nnuance of Wilde\u2019s novel.\nDare I say, the book is\nbetter than the play?\nAn imaginative spin on a Shakespearean Classic // Lou Morris Photography\nShakespeare time travels to the roaring 20s for this\nunique twist on a classic comedy.\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nWhere?The Rose Playhouse\nWhen? 23 April - 5 May\nHow Much?

Powerful and\nrazor-sharp, he radiates\nthe aura of one who is\nused to having his every\ndesire fulfilled and with\nno compunctions about\ncrushing others in the\nprocess. The seductive\npower of Wrather\u2019s Lord\nHenry would corrupt\nanyone. It makes it all\nthe more moving when\nhe reappears in the last\nscenes as a broken man,\nwho, for all his hedonistic\nconvictions, has not found\nwhat he wanted in life.\nDaniel Goode makes\na good effort at playing\nBasil Hallward, the artist\nwho is in love with Dorian\nand tries to save him from\nhis downfall. It\u2019s a very\nrestrained and yearning\ndepiction, with Hallward\nleft dismayed and powerless as Dorian slips further\ninto degeneracy. The only\nthing is that the relationship between the two\nseems entirely one-sided.\nYou don\u2019t really get the\nsense that Dorian is at all\nmoved by Basil or that\nBasil \u2018could have saved\nDorian\u2019 with his love \u2013 he\njust seems a bit of a side\ncharacter who Dorian\ntires of once Lord Henry\ncomes into the picture.\n\n"

Stephanie Dinkins\nAI: More than Human sees collaboration between cutting edge researchers at DeepMind (MIT) and a wide range\nof artists including Stephanie Dinkins.\nARTS\nS\ntephanie Dinkins\u2019\neureka moment\ncame as she stood\nface-to-face with\nBINA48, a black female\nrobot residing in a first-floor office in Vermont.\nThe opportunity was\nthanks to the work of the\nTerasem Foundation, a\ngroup dedicated to testing\nthe limits of uploading\na mind into a computer.\nFaced with \u201cthe only\nblack female robot on the\nplanet\u201d, Dinkins felt that\nher cyber companion\u2019s\nanswers to questions\nabout race and gender\nseemed incongruent with\nthe experience of a black\nwoman in 21st century\nAmerica.\nTechnology, often host\nto futuristic fantasy, also\nreminds us of very present\nconcerns. For Dinkins,\nthere is a tangible fear\nthat \u201cAI and technology\nwill start homogenising us\n\u2026 boiling us down to the\nmean\u201d. How can we create\nsentient entities meant to\noperate in cosmopolitan\ncommunities when the\ncreators are far from cos-mopolitan? Is the answer\nfor AI entities to only be\nencoded by people from\ntheir \u2018community\u2019? According to Dinkins, \u201cprogrammers require lots and\nlots of information and\ninterviews and contact,\nto appreciate some of the\nnuances of a culture\u201d.\nThus, the path forward\nlies not in the subjective\nexperience of whoever\nwrites the code, but\neducation and exposure\nto different communities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just providing\nfacades,\u201d Dinkins is eager\nto emphasise.\nWith in this drive to understand others in order to\ncreate a synthetic identity\ncomes \u201cideas of empathy,\ncompassion, ethical\nstances towards each\nother\u201d, says Dinkins.\nPerhaps, one is allowed\nto hope, planning for the\nfuture can help to heal the\nenduring ignorance and\nmisunderstandings of the\npresent.\nBased on her experience and art engaging with\nauthenticity and agency,\nand with the generous\nfunding of Pioneer Works\nTech Lab and others,\nDinkins has created Not\nThe Only One, or N\u2019TOO.\nThe project is a multigen-erational memoir of three\ngenerations of women\nin her family (spanning\nalmost a century), as told\nby a custom deep-learning\nAI. The AI has been fed\nnumerous interviews\nwith these women and\ncontinues to gather new\nknowledge from interactions with the public. The\nidea of learning through\nexposure to the real world\nis reminiscent of Microsoft\u2019s AI chatter bot, Tay,\nwhich enjoyed a life-span\nof 16 hours during which\nit evolved from a na\u00efve\nonline sentience into, as\nDinkins puts it, a \u201ccrazy,\nvile, racist, homophobic,\nxenophobic thing\u201d. A\nbitter reminder that online\ndiscourse is perhaps not\nthe best way to raise a\nnew-bornAI. When I raise\nthis fear with Dinkins,\nshe concedes that she\nprovides only a foundation upon which the AI\nbuilds its own sentience.\nHowever, to follow her\nfamily traditions, N\u2019TOO\nis designed not to \u2018hear\u2019\ncrude or vulgar terms. In\ndoing so, she treads a fine\nline between \u2018organic\u2019\ngrowth of the AI and\ncultural limits.\nThe tradition of oral\nhistory is deeply rooted in\nolder cultures. The griot,\nfound in present-day\nWest African tribes, is a\nhistorian, story-teller and\nvocal artist. As Francis\nBebey, Cameroonian\nwriter, wrote in African\nMusic: A People\u2019s Art, the\ngriot is \u201ca living archive\nof the people\u2019s traditions\u201d,\none who receives news\nand information from\nthe community. Though\nDinkins is reluctant to lay\nclaim to the griot heritage\nand title, she recognises\na curious similarity\nbetween her family\u2019s oral\ntradition and N\u2019TOO\u2019s\nessence: \u201cthings are verbal\n\u2026 they\u2019re somewhat\nencoded.\u201d While griots\nare bound by mortal\nlimitations and lifespans,\nN\u2019TOO may become what\nDinkins dubs \u201calmost the\nactive griot with a digital\nmemory\u201d. However, the\nsimilarities end there.\nThe human griot offers\nbroad sweeping lessons in\nhuman nature, while the\ninterpersonal conversations recorded by N\u2019TOO\nold data\u201d? For Dinkins, the\nmovement to \u201chave more\npeople of colour in the top\nranks helping to write the\ncode, write the algorithms,\nand control some of the\nways they\u2019re being used\nor sold to other systems\u201d\nbrings both social and\neconomic benefits. If you\neducate communities\nabout algorithms using\nnon-biased data, you get\nwhat Dinkins heralds as\n\u201cbetter outcomes\u201d. For\ninstance, a ProPublica\nreport into machine bias\nrevealed how algorithms\nbased on zipcodes charged\nAsian-Americans more,\non average, for online\nSAT tutoring. However,\nthis extends beyond\n\u201csmall social justice \u2026\npredict when technology\nwill reach the feared\nsingularity, when it eventually surpasses human\nintelligence.
