    "content": "Letters\ni to the\nEditor\n11 ,\nDear Mark\nSince you appealed for\nletters I thought I would spend a little of my valuable\ntime replying to your editorial\non \" Life After Mr McCabe\". Barney remains my friend.\nI do not understand the\nworkings of his mind but I like\nhim. However, he was a lazy\nDP( to use your own de scrip tion). I have no hesitation in\nsaying that here or in the\noffice since I have spent many\nmonths telling Barney exactly\nthat. Lazy, inefficient, but\noccasionally brilliantly inventive. The reason Barney has not\nbeen appreciated in the office\nover the last few weeks is that\nwe have all been overwhelmed by detailed figures\nand un placed orders. The detective work necessary to\nget to the bottom of accounts,\netc., has proved rather tires ome. However, largely thanks to the acting DP, everything is now straightened\nand we probably won't feel'\nquite so bad about McCabe's mess from now on.\nYou remind your readers hip that I defended the\nExecutive, including Mr' McCabe, against a ridiculous\nmotion of no confidence at aUG M last term. All I can say\nis \"Solidarity Brothers\".\nFinally may I say that I do\nnot recognise Christine Teller\nas a deity, she is a bloody\nnuisance at times.\nTours\nNick Morton)\nDear Sir\nFrank Must Go! The Falkland Islands Crisis\nbrings out the best in our\n(resident nuncio\u2014about 750\nwords of pure SDP bull. (God\nbless David Owen!). Our man\nat IC, and just how long has\nFrank been here, rambles from the Falklands, through\nSouth Africa, into El Salvador, whips across to Japan via Suez and comes back to\nLondon via Plymouth (Devon-port). We must admire Frank's per ambulatory skills.\nHas he thought of writing a book on his journey (John\nHillaby would, I am sure,\noffer some guidance)?\nI will of course note Frank's remarks on defence, crime\n(and we do have a lot in\nNotting Hill) PS BR and the\ncivil service when I cast my\nvote on Thursday.\n(Shsh....who was that man\nwho mentioned housing, fares\nfare and police-community\nrelations?).\nTours sincerely\nDavid Kelsall\nChe mEn gPG Dear Mark\nIt was with disappointment\nthat I found Frank James( FELIX612) attempting to\nmake cheap political capital\nout of the Falklands crisis at a time when national unity over\nthis unfortunate episode is\nvital. Frank claims that in\nendeavour ing to recover the\nislands, Mrs Thatcher is\naiming to divert attention from the government's record\nat home, and somehow save\nher own skin.\nThe truth is the complete\nopposite of this. The business\ncould not have come at a worse possible time for the\ngovernment, when its economic policies are at last beginning to bear fruit and its\nelectoral support climbing.\nAlthough the vast majority of\nthe people approve of the\ngovernment's handling of the\ndispute now, the first British\nship that sinks in the South\nAtlantic will carry much of\nthat support with it\u2014probably\nthe chances of a Tory victory\nin the next election as well.\nThe government's resolve j to right the wrong the Falklanders have suffered, by\ndiplomatic means if at all possible, but by force if necessary is not just about the\nislands, but about the cause of\nfreedom everywhere in the\nworld. It ill-becomes Frank to\nsnipe at it.\nTours sincerely\nTim Lawes\nDear Sir\nIn FELIX612 there was a 'Soapbox' article by Frank\nJames, attacking the conservative government particularly over its handling of the \u2022\nFalkland dispute. Fine, I agree with him so far. But at\nthe end there was a call for us\nto vote for Liberal or SDP candidates in the local elections because of this. Here I must disagree. The May6 elections are for district councillors responsible for\nsuch things as planning, housing and the environment\nand in metropolitan districts\nfor education and social services. They do not have\nany responsibility of course,\nfor foreign affairs.\nAs a liberal I believe in\ndecentralisation and the importance of the local community. I believe these\nelections should be taken seriously in their own right\nand not be seen just as an\nopinion poll on the govern-ment's performance. It is only\nin this way that we will get\ngood and responsible local\ngovernment and resist calls\nfor greater government control of local authorities.\nTours sincerely\nMatthew Hunt bach Dear Mark\nWhat the hell is going on in\nthe IC Bookshop?

    "content": "Sweet Freedom: the struggle for women's liberation, by Anna Coote and Beatrix\nCampbell, Picador \u00a31.95.\nAll militant organisations and philosophies\nhave more or less the same approach, and\nthere are several characteristics that militant\nfeminism has in common with, say, the\nSocialist Workers Party or the Moral Majority.\nThis book, which is an account of the women's movement from the early sixties onwards, is\nan example of the output from the more\nuncompromising kind of fem in is im, and it has\nall the features you' d expect of militant\nliterature.\nThe strangest thing about a lot of pressure\ngroups is their apparent indifference to being\nunpopular, the way they seem to be willing to\nbecome ghettoes for the people who share\ntheir beliefs, with the rest of the human race\nmore or less written off as fascists, com-munis ts, racists, traitors, sexists, etc., as the\ncase may be. Feminists are one of the groups\nwho appear to have adopted this attitude of 'if\nyou are not with us you are against us'\n(although this doesn't apply so much to the\nfeminist group at IC, WIST). The atmosphere\nof the book is one of genuine disgust and anger\nat the injustices caused by the selfishness of\nmen. The authors describe women's grievances in great detail and they're certainly\nsincere, they don't hesitate to attack the\nLabour Party and the trade unions when they\nthink it's necessary. But although all\nwomen are considered to be the victims of\nmale domination, the women's groups are\ndescribed as small, conspiratorial organisations ('small groups, linked by a sense of\ninvolvement and a common cause') forming a kind of underground resistance movement.\nThey communicate by circulating 'ill typed\nr one oed sheets', a sort of feminist sami zd at, and they use the usual jargon-dialect. The\nbook is a cesspool of jargon words and slogans, starting with the book's subtitle and\nfollowing with arguments for destroying 'masculinity as a social construct' through\n' highly complex political analyses' with 'analytical approaches' and 'strategic priorities'\nplaced 'in the context of cultural traditions\nwhich object if y and silence women', etc., etc.\nThe style and format (with sub-headings and\na list of references after each chapter) are\npartly meant to make the book seem more\nlearned and expert but mostly they're there\nbecause it's the conventional style and it\nprobably wouldn't occur to the authors to\nwrite in any other way. Only a relatively small\nnumber of people will like such a style; no bus\nconductor or dinner lady would read this book\nand it's unlikely that the authors would expect\nthem to. Like other militant activists, feminists\nseem to like pretending that they' re a dedicated band of subversives, bravely\nspeaking out against the might of the system.\nThe book doesn't try to appeal to large\nnumbers of people, instead it's aimed at the\nfeminist intelligentsia, people like Anna Coote\nand Beatrix Campbell. To appeal to them it\nhas to maintain the pretence that they're\nstruggling in the face of appalling injustice and\nrepression, so overstatements are common,\nfor example \" An intensive war is waged against\nwomen, to degrade them as human beings, to\ndeny their ideas and achievements, and to\nsuppress their own perception of the world.\"\nAnd since everyone likes to think that their\nclique is the one that counts they also exaggerate their own importance:\" the women's liberation movement is one of the\nmost important political dev elopements of this\ncentury....\"\nLike other movements, such as Black Consciousness or the Democratic Unionists,\nthe feminists have turned into a sort of\ndistorted mirror image of what they' re attacking. They refer to women's conferences\nand positive action (discrimination in favour of\nwomen and against men) without any sense of\nirony. The authors, judi ng by the way they\nwrite, regard men in general with contempt\nand some disgust. Woman are being oppressed, in their view, by a huge complex\nprocess controlled by the cynical and power\nhungry half of the population, the men.\nAll in all there's little difference between\nfeminist propaganda, like this book, and that of\nthe K lu Klux Klan or the Animal Liberation\nFront, it's only preaching to the converted.\nThe feminists are saying things that need to be\nsaid but it's a pity that they should be\nrepresented by books like Sweet Freedom;\nthey won't lose their bunch-of-cranks image\nuntil they start talking to the outside world.\nN. Willson\nMidnight's Children by Salman Rushdie,\nPicador, 462 pages, \u00a32.95.\nThe gimmick is given away in the first\nparagraph. We learn of Saleem, welded to\nhistory by his birth and ancestry. The\nremaining two last words expand and develop.\nIn the tradition of the story-teller we are\nguided down through three generations and\nmillions of litres of bloodshed as the Aziz and\nSinai families are ground between the events\nthat have shaped the last sixty years in India.\nDown through Hart a land partition riot,\nlanguage battles and war, all the way to the\nemergency. Saleem's betrayal by the man he\nshould have been, and the betrayal of the\nchildren of independance to the Widow and\nher son from the pivot of this extraordinary\nbook.\nWhile \" My presentation of the Emergency in\nthe guise of a six hundred and thirty five day\nIIi iiO i \u2022\nSalman Rushdie long midnight was perhaps excessively romantic and certainly contradicted by the\navailable meteorological data\" it contains more\ntruth than the grab-for-personal-power usually\ndescribed. The castration of hope and the\nsubsequent feast for the Benarsi pie dogs,\ndescribes well the uselessness of Mrs Ghandi's opponents.\nLike all good stories this one has magic,\nmoney and love to sweeten the moral. And Rushdie can tell his powerful but depressing\nstory so as to make it compulsive. With flowery prose and resigned humour he can\ngenerate a sort of nostalgia for the India of\nmutilated beggars, Breach Candy and casual\ndeath that sticks with me.\nIf you have ten hours spare before the\nexams, this is the way to fill them. Midnight's Children is very good.\nTom Owen\nZig-Zag by Richard Thornley, Picador\n\u00a31.95.\nPicador have discovered a good writer at last.\nThere are three long short stories in the book,\ncalled 'Gastarbeiter', 'Jewels' and 'Tourist\nAttraction'. They're all written in the first\nperson. The first story is very good, and it's worth getting the book for that one alone. It's about a hitch-hiker in Germany who gets a lift\non a heavy lorry to Belgium and drives it part\nof the way himself. It doesn't sound very\npromising but because of the interesting documentary details and because it's very well\nwritten, it's the best that Picador have published for years.\nThe story starts with the hero leaving a German hostel and catching an underground\ntrain towards the autobahn, where he\neventually gets a lift from a lorry just as it's starting up for the day. The hero, who'seems\nto be the author, is a kind of modified late\nsixties figure, he drifts around Efirope carrying\na few belongings in a plastic bag.An unexpected touch is that both the hero and\nthe lorry driver are ex-public schoolboys and\nthe lorry driver says he's proud of it. It's one of\nthe things that make the atmosphere slightly\ndifferent from what you'd expect, like the late\nsixties atmosphere but with most of the\npsychedelic ness replaced by gritty realism.\nThe account of the lorry journey and the\nconversations about long distance driving are\nvery convincing and interesting, but he's not\nso strong on character is ation. The next two\nstories depend a lot on character is ation and\nthey're mediocre, nowhere near as good as the\nfirst. The second one, 'Jewels', is about life on\na French anarchist commune.( The story\ntakes place before the events of the first one,\nthe publishers seem to have put ''Gastarbeiter'\nfirst as a sort of bait.) It starts well for the first\nten pages or so but then it becomes preoccupied with inter-personal relationships\nand since there are eight or nine characters all\nmuch the same it's hard to remember which is\nwhich. The third story 'Tourist Attraction' is\nabout an Italian merchant who sells trash to\ntourists and wants to go to California and get\nrich by selling cars. It's written from the point\nof view of his friend who works at another\nmarket stall. It's about as interesting to read as\nthe second story. But 'Gastarbeiter' is very\ngood, if Richard Thornley can write something\nelse as good as that it'll be well worth reading.\nN. Willson\nPage 6 FELIX, May 7, 1982\n\n"

Well, would you simply like to enjoy your life more?\nTranscendental Meditation is an easy and totally effortless mental\ntechnique practised twice a day for about 20 minutes just sitting down\ncomfortably with the eyes closed. This technique allows the mind to\nautomatically settle down to quieter and more refined levels. The mind\nremains very alert and yet the degree of rest obtained is far greater than\nthat at any point in deep sleep (see Scientific American, Feb 1972 or The\nLancet, April 1970).\nIt is this profound restful state which brings about great benefits in daily\nactivity. The actual experience of meditating is extremely pleasant but\nthe whole purpose of practising TM is to enjoy the results. People who\npractise TM find that they have much\" more energy, that their thinking\nbecomes clearer, that any worries or anxieties gradually fade away. A sense of inner wellbeing and calmness is brought about leading to more\neffective and dynamic activity in daily life. The results are very\nspontaneous and accumulate with regular practice.\nTM is not a cult or a kind of belief-system, it is simply a mental\ntechnique that anyone can practise and it works!

    "content": "Anti anti-apartheid\nby N. Willson\n\" Oh God, not another one of those self-righteous anti-apartheid pratt s\" is probably the\ntypical reaction of anIC student when someone asks him to think about South Africa.\nMost students here would agree that it's wrong for a minority to assume control over a majority. Practically no one would support the\nuse of machine guns and secret police to keep\nthe minority in control. Yet the common reaction to any protest over apartheid is one of\nsneering and ridicule. On the face of it there\ndoesn't seem to be any reason why people's reaction should be like that. There are some\nstudents here who are sympathetic towards\napartheid, but there aren't many of them and\n\u2022 they usually don't have the guts to say so in\npublic. Most students are just not that\nbothered, they're not really pro-apartheid but\nanti anti-apartheid. This is a great pity because\nSouth Africa is one of those issues where\npublic opinion really counts, and you could\nhardly imagine a more straightforward case of\nan injustice that ought to be put right. But the\nfact is that the anti-apartheid cause has got\nitself a bad image, and it's largely its own fault.\nThe Anti-Apartheid Group here is unpopular\npartly for the same reason that the Salvation\nArmy was (and still is) unpopular. Their approach suggests that unless you are\nconstantly deeply concerned about the\ninjustices they draw attention to then you are\nsomehow inferior and ought to be ashamed of\nyourself. It's an unfair picture but it is the\nimpression that the apathetic masses of IC\ntend to have, and it doesn't make them well\ndisposed towards the Anti-Apartheid Group.\nAnd the Anti-Apartheid Group is bound to\nbe disliked because it's a political organisation\nand therefore tainted with dishonesty. At a recent meeting of the group someone suggested, perfectly seriously, that the\nmembers should distribute themselves around\nthe audience in the next U GM so that they\ncould ask sympathetic questions about the\nanti-apartheid resolution, to make it look as\nthough ordinary students are interested in the\nmotion. Any organisation with people like that\nin it is going to be looked down on.\nAnother reason why anti apartheid is\nunpopular is that it's so fashionable (except at\nplaces like IC or Sandhurst). Nobody is going\nto get into trouble for attacking apartheid and\npeople sense that a lot of the protests' against\napartheid are made only or largely because it's the 'thing to do'. And it's likely that many\npeople involve themselves in anti-apartheid\nbecause it makes them feel virtuous (the same\nprobably applies to ICCA G, blood do ning and\nso on). Because of this, most of the leaflets and\nbooklets produced by anti-apartheid organisations have an atmosphere of artificial indignation about them. The style they're\nwritten in wouldn't be used by anyone who\nwanted to get uncommitted people on his side.\nPhrases like 'a crime against humanity' or 'the\ninternational community must denounce' aren't written to sway public opinion but\nbecause they sound solemn and imposing. The\naim of a lot of anti-South Africa protestors\nseems to be a desire to present themselves as\nfearless, altruistic fighters for People's Rights\nbecause if expected of them by their party or\nfaction. Or, especially where foreign governments are concerned, they might want\nto distract attention from their own practices.\nSo an enormous amount of hy pro cris y surrounds the anti-apartheid movement, and a lot of anti-apartheid statements (and books,\nfilms, articles, television programmes, interviews, press releases, UN resolutions)\nhave a synthetic air about them, they give the\nimpression of being manufactured by putting\ntogether a list of the approved slogans in some\nnew permutation.\nBut the attacks on apartheid aren't always\njust propaganda. UN Soc recently gave away\nsome anti-apartheid literature when they were\nshowing a film about South Africa and among\nthe rubbish there was a book called 'Apartheid\nin Practice', published by the UN. It's a compilation of apartheid regulations and laws\ntranslated into simple language by Leslie\nRubin, who is (or was in 1976) an American\nprofessor of law. It gives a much clearer\npicture of South Africa's race laws than you'll\nget from most anti-apartheid literature, and it\nshows how far the authorities have gone to\nmake about80% of the population a submerged class. \" An African living in a town\nwho conducts a class in reading and writing\nwithout remuneration in his own home for a few of his African friends is guilty of a criminal\noffence...\" (Bantu Education Act, 1953).\n\" An African factory worker who is absent\nfrom work for 24 hours without permission...is\nguilty of a criminal offence...\" (Bantu Labour\nAct, 1964).\n\" An African may not, even as a personal\nfavour and without receiving payment, repair a defective electrical fitting in the living quarters\nof a friend who resides on his employee's premises as the job is classified as 'skilled'. If he\ndoes so, he is guilty of a criminal offence \"\n(Bantu Building Workers Act, 1951). There are\nlots of other examples in the booklet.\nApart from the anti-apartheid movement's own shortcomings, there are several reasons\nwhy IC students will tend not to go along with\ntheir aims. For a start, nobody likes the word\n'anti'. It seems vaguely wrong to be exclusively\nagainst something, even if the something is\ndefinitely bad.( A common response to\nquestions about South Africa is 'What about\nIran/the USSR/Ethiopia/India/Poland etc?'\nBut the people who say that never seem to\nprotest about those countries either.) More\nimportant is the general tendency among students towards cynicism, not because students have thought carefully and decided\nthat everything deserves to be regarded cynically, but because it's fashionable. So\nstudents tend to be mildly embarrassed by\nwords like 'justice' or 'freedom' and causes like\nanti-apartheid consequently suffer.\nThe main reason why people won't do\nanytHing about apartheid (such as voting for\nU GM motions) is because they can't be\nbothered\u2014and after all it's too much to expect\npeople to be constantly in a stew over apartheid or anything else. But this is an issue\nwhere things like U GM motions will do some\ngood and if anti-apartheid groups didn't turn\nout so much trashy propaganda (and the IC\ngroup is better than most) then they could get\nsomething done.\nN.

One large , slightly worn\nmicrometer + one quarter\nfinal, University Challenge\nImperial College's run of success in University Challenge\nended on Wednesday when they were beaten by St. Andrew's. The team of Tim Pigden, Gordon Masterton, Alun Griffiths\nand Martin S. Taylor had won three consecutive rounds of the\ncompetition to reach the quarter-final\nThe Union mascot Mike was stolen from the Union Office\nbetween 2 and 7 am yesterday morning.\nThe massive micrometer needs three people to carry it and was left\nbehind the Union receptionist's desk by a group, including President\nNick Morton and Honorary Secretary Marco Led wold, who had just\nreturned from the University Challenge quarter-final in Manchester.\nThe incident was reported by cleaners who found the Senior\nCommon Room door and the door connecting the S CR and Union office both open. The raiders are believed to have entered through the\nS CR and passed the mascot out through aS CR window to a vehicle\nwaiting outside.\nImmediate suspects were Kings College who have twice broken into\nthe gymnasium looking for their mascot Reggie since it was violated by\nthe Royal College of Science Union last February. However when\nMarco Led wold went to a Kings Union General Meeting yesterday\nMike was not on display.\nThose responsible for the loss now believe City and Guilds College\nUnion have Mike while the popular theory in the FELIX Office that it\nwas taken by Argentinian scrap metal dealers.\n...and found again.\nTHE PHOENIX1982 has now arrived and is available free from IC Union Office, the FELIX office, the Bookshop, Haldane Library and\nLyon Playfair Library. The final score was 365 to 160 although the result could have been\ndifferent had IC been slightly quicker to answer. Indeed question-master Bamber Gascoigne re-assured the IC team several times that\ntheir buzzers were working properly, as they were just beaten to it on\nmany occasions.\nIn a rehearsal match consisting of questions from a previous round St\nAndrew's heavily defeated IC, although it was later revealed that St.\nAndrew's had sat in on the round from which the questions were taken.\nLater in the day St. Andrew's defeated Mag del en College, Cambridge to reach the final.\nThe contests were recorded in the Granada Television Studios in\nManchester with each team limited to 25 supporters. All the St.\nAndrew's supporters and team wore red robes while despite having to\nturn away many would be supporters IC did n'tl ill its quota. After the contest President Nick Morton, fresh from his victory in the\nbeer-drinking competition at the nearby Pineapple, commented \" well I suppose that'sl our fewer social colours we'll be awarding.\" The Union mascot Mike was taken to Manchester although its\npresent whereabouts are unknown.\n\"No. 613 Friday, May 7,1982 Free!\n\n"

However, since the\nbuilding has been occupied, a fairly serious outbreak of dry rot\nhas lead to crumbling walls and ce il ngs and some residents have\nbeen moved to vacated rooms\nwhile repairs are attempted.\nIt is not certain that the rot\nwas present when the building was purchased and that it was\nnot recognised by the Estates\nsection.\nThe \u00a316,000 estimated cost of\nrepairs could adversely affect the\nlevels of rent for the next academic year in all College residences.\nOpsoc\nMarathon\nOver fifty people from ICU Operatic Society and 'Imperial\nOpera( an organisation for former Opsoc students) took part\nin a marathon performance of all\n13 Gilbert and Sullivan operettas\nat the weekend.\nStarting at 12 noon on Saturday, a constant stream of people\nbattled through28 hours of singing and dialogue.

Mr Campbell disliked the term 'investigative' and said he was only a journalist working harder and doing his job better than most others.\nHe pointed out that most of his 'leads' came from analysis of\ninformation that is readily available and that clandestine meetings in\nthe middle of car parks with conscience-torn civil servants were\nuncommon. Mr Campbell felt that if a story was factually correct and\nin the public interest, no libel proceedings or charges under the Official\nSecrets Act would be brought against the author or publisher.\nMr Campbell then answered a number of questions, mainly on the\nmost successful techniques for acquiring information.\nThe LS JG is composed of people already involved in student\nnewspapers or who hope to start one.

    "content": "What's On\nMike\nThe mysterious disappearance of the IC\nUnion mascot Mike must be a total surprise to\nmany, not least Nick Morton and Marco Ledwold. Mike has been kept under lock and\nkey for so long that it seems inconceivable that\nsomeone should just happen to swipe it on this\nrare occasion of vulnerability.\nThe appearance of Mike at Wednesday's University Challenge match in Manchester\nwas its first outing for a long time. Former\nDeputy President Barney McCabe was too\nlazy to take it to UG Ms half the time and failed\nto take Mike to previous University Challenge\nmatches, despite aUG M motion mandating\nhim to do so.\nNick Morton and Marco Ledwold knew this\nvery well and were obviously trying to make\namends, but once more they seem to have\nbungled it. Mike shouldn't really have been left\nunattended in the Union Office at all! Why didn't Nick or Marco take it back to their\nrooms, for instance, where it would have been\nmuch safer?\nIt seems to me that someone on the\nUniversity Challenge coach seized on the\nopportunity of stealing it for some strange\nreason (after all, they were probably the only\npeople around at 2am) and capitalised on\nthe dynamic duos' unfortunate mistake.\nHard Luck!\nThe defeat of the University Challenge team\nputs an end to a run of victories which must\nhave done a tremendous amount of good for\nthe College's reputation. Alun Griffiths, Tim Pigden, Martin Taylor and Gordon Masterton\nshould all be congratulated for their efforts.\nThey played very well and have un doubt ably paved the way for more frequent participation\nin University Challenge by this College.\nIt was very annoying to find that five people\nwho said they wanted to go to Manchester\ndidn't turn up as promised, as we only had 25\npeople at the studio. Marco turned people\naway in fact, and so these five lowly creatures\nshould be ashamed that they didn't tell him\nearlier.\nSteve Goulder's21 st\nOn Sunday, President-elect Steven Goulder\ncelebrates his 21st birthday.

Keys will be\ndistributed to the Exec and no one will hold\nkeys to all the locks. In fact no two or even\nthree Exec members will be able to remove\nMike. Quorum has been agreed as four, and so\nkeys will be allocated in such a way that any\nfour of the six Exec members will be able to\nuse their keys collectively to unlock Mike.\nThe plan works well enough on paper, but\nI'm beginning to wonder if Chris Teller has\nconsidered the finances; I for one wouldn't like\nto break it to her that she'll need at\nleast padlocks?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me at\nthe FELIX Office, please.

Now if F is pure,\nhis reply about it will be \" He is applied\" which\ncould equally well be the reply of an applied\nmathematician.

I won't say any more about it\nsince those of us who were there know what\nhappened.

Sundays\nexcellent hosts, Magdalen College, Oxford, again provided marvellous hospitality which we duly thanked them for by giving them a good old stuffing which must have made their\ncucumber sandwiches hard to stomach. Bell\n(57) and Magness (82), after a good start by\nour openers, provided the fireworks, leading\nto 2 3 0 for 7 declared.

The event opened on Wednesday with a small amount of sailing, which we won,\nfollowed by a\" torch race\". For this they\noffered a prize for the most ridiculous team,\nIC took it as an o port unity to throw molten\nwax round the place whilst racing three\nlegged with flashing bow ties or carrying\ni Fiona. Despite the somewhat comical appearance of Strathclyde University in their\nkilts they did not merit as highly on the\nDutch\" originality\" scale and so IC took the\nprize.\nThursday saw some more sailing which we\nwon. The Tilburg II volleyball team were\nshort of members, so I CSC took up volleyball\nand Julian broke a finger. The first IC hospital case. Sue finding that car boot lids\nare harder than heads, made the second IC hospital case as she went to have her eye\npatched together.\nAt this stage it seemed a good time to teach\nthe opposition how to boat race. This time\nwith \" bier\"( lager) served in ' / 3 pt glasses.\nDowning two each IC still managed to win. Friday, sadness. Slight error or judgement\nLeiden get 1st,2 nd,3 rd on the start line\nsailing. The rules -do not allow the taking of\n\"greens\" but insist instead on 720\u00b0 turns (two\ncomplete revolutions) and at once it seems IC should take up ballroom dancing so good are\nthey at pirouetting. However, this gives\nLieden victory, in their own boats, which incidentally were/were not as exciting to sail\nas \"optimists\". However, since they were the\nonly team to beat us, IC came second. About this point in an artistic disembarkation Pat\nleft a boat after a blow on the nose from a boom. Third IC hospital case. Then back to\nthe bar (\"canteen\") for liquid consolation,\nfor losing, Hex a pawn played with glasses on\na tiled floor and bottle racing, which we won.\nThanks to \" Pendragon Kat holi eke Hogeschool\" for excellent organisation and to Nick for use of his van and to Pat for\norganisation and use of his car.\nThe cast: Debbie, Fiona, Graham, Ian, Jim,\nJulian, Mike, Nick, Pat, Richard, Simon, Sue.\n& Hockey\nMixed\nThe Worthing Mixed Hockey Festival\nStevie led his merry band.\nDown to the coast to sea and sand,\nBut although we wished for blazing sun,\nAs it turned out there wasn't none!\nPhil Webb came down from London town\nAnd looked us up bearing a frown\nSo as we knew the veterans weren't playing We put him on and started praying!\nDespite Phil'smap we camped on site\nAnd set about contracting frostbite!\nThe late arrival of Karen and Sarah\nWas explained by the call for a car repair er Barry's clapped out Triumph if seemed\nHad finally gone and run out of steam!\nThe first game was lost 1-0 I'm afraid\nSo was the second\u2014but on we played.\nWe found a pub to sit and think\nAnd were helped out by some half-price\ndrinks!\nFor Andrew this was the weekend's high\n\u2014 Not the hockey but the chefs turkey pie!\nSunday dawned to peaceful snores\nAs we played out a nil-nil draw\nHowever everyone was heard to rave\nAbout Jonesey's fabulous penalty save\nThe last match on we had to win So Steve and Alison tucked goals in Then Barry and Phil added two more\nTo make the score\u2014you've guessed it\u2014four\nThe reason for the win was clear\n\u2014 Barry and Phil had taken to beer\nHowever well they played I insist\nThat both of them were totally pissed!\nThe squad: C.
