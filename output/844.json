    "content": "Achaeologists are now learning more about how our ancestors lived from what they definitely wanted to leave behind...\nThe passed and the present\nThe science of archaeology once concerned itself only\nwith bones, pottery and treasure. More recently it has\nexpanded to cover such things as the study of animal\nand plant deposits and, as Andrew Jones of the\nEnviromental Archaeology Unit of York University told\nthe BA, of what is easily the oldest of human\nactivities. Jones is an expert on the archaeology of\nexcrement.\nHe argues that by identifying faeces among the\ndebris of a dig, much can be learnt about the diet, the\nstate of health and the standards of hygiene of its\nformer inhabitants.\nThere are few other methods for exploring these\nparticular aspects of life. Historical documentary\nevidence is scarce although historians do know that\nhygiene had a low priority in medieval times. There\nis written evidence of frequently overflowing\ncesspools and primitive lavatories that emptied onto\nthe street. People in the 14th century thought nothing\nof relieving themselves at night out of the bedroom\nwindow, and public latrines, apart from being filthy,\nwere favourite haunts for muggers. Such a society\noffers rich pickings for someone like Andrew Jones.\nThe first problem that any excrement archaeologist\nfaces when he visits a site is that of separating\ncenturies-old faeces from other ancient organic\nmaterial such as waste food and animal dung.\n'Fortunately,' the BA was told, 'the ancient excrement\ndetective has clear clues to follow.'\nThe eggs of the parasitic worms which live inside\nanimal intestines are fairly resilient and can be easily\nand accurately identified after being buried for\nthousands of years. The problem is not identifying the\neggs but identifying the unfortunate host. Whipworm\neggs are a useful clue: they are large and easily\nrecognisable but the whip worm is known to infect\npigs, dogs, mice, rats and sheep as well as human\nbeings.\nFor help, the researchers turned to the bodies from\nthe bogs: ancient human remains preserved intact in\nthe acidic conditions of a peat marsh. These bodies\nhave been found to be parasitise d by whip worms of\nparticular species, the eggs of which are significantly\nsmaller than those found in other animals. This gave\nresearchers an ideal method with which to separate\nhuman and animal excrement.\nThe technique helped identify the so-called 'Lloyds\nBank turd' excavated in York as being of human origin:\nit contained around 133 000 whip worm eggs per\ngram.\nThere are other clues. Latrine pits contain large\nquantities of recognisably intact cereal bran. Fish\nbones have also been found. The bones are of\nparticular interest to Jones who carried out a series\nof experiments to see if they could be traced back to\nhumans.\nAn unnamed experimenter ate a whole kipper and\nfaeces were collected over the following week. These\nwere found to contain a small number of fish bones\ncrushed and partially dissolved in exactly the same\nway as those found in the latrines. This is significant:\nfish bones can survive in conditions that can destroy\nparasite eggs.\nArchaeologists are now learning more about how\nour ancestors lived from what they definitely wanted\nto leave behind.\nNew brains for old\nFool's gold\nAlchemy is much more than just a vain attempt to\ntransform base metals into gold. It is a much more\ncomplicated subject which encompassed the brewing\nof medicines and potions and developed the basic\nprinciples which became the modern science of\nchemistry. It was the subject of the only meeting of\nthe British Association's History of Science section.\nAlchemy came in many forms: from the Islamic\ncountries, from China and from Europe. Islamic\nalchemy still shows itself today in the chemist al terminology in such words as 'alkali', 'alcohol' and\n'elixir'.\nIn China, alchemists were regarded as healers and\nused Saltpetre (Potassium Nitrate) as a powerful\nmedicine, so powerful in fact that steps were taken\nto reduce its strength. By 300AD they were heating\nit with Sulphur; by 850AD someone had thought of\nadding honey to the mixture. As any good chemist will\ntell you Potassium Nitrate, Sulphur and a source of\nCarbon such as Honey are the ingredients of\ngunpowder.\nAlchemy also floris he d in Britain, Issac Newton\nspent time studying the subject and it did not die out\nuntil a century or so after his death. The last person\nto attempt to demonstrate alchemy in this country\nwas a man called Price. He was called before a meeting the Royal Institution to give a demonstration.\nUnsurprisingly he failed and was so ashamed that he\ncommited suicide at the meeting. No one has followed\nin his footsteps.\nPage 10\nProfessor David Marsden is one of the few researchers\nwhose work has attracted the attention of the World's media. He was one of the pioneers in the use of foetal\ncells to repair the damaged brains of the victims of\nParkinson's disease. The cells produce the chemical\ndopamine which sufferers' brains lack. Recently, he\nhas tried to extend the technique to the repair of\nsevered spinal nerves.\nSo far, the only spinal nerve experiments have been\non animals and the work on Parkinsonism, although\nit is now using human guinea pigs, has yet to produce\nconvincing results. The condition of the first.patients\nhas only slightly improved.\nDepressives, people for whom the World is\nunremitting ly awful and only likely to get worse,\nwould probably not take comfort from the latest\npsychological research; they could be right.\nReceived wisdom, according to Dr Shirley Fisher of\nStrathclyde University, says that there is a fault in the\nway a depressive perceives evidence. He or she is\nmore likely to over general is e, to be pessimistic and\nto accept blame. This is believed to lead to a loss of\nmotivation and a drop in self esteem.\nHowever recent laboratory evidence seems to\nindicate that the depressed are good judges of\nevidence 'especially when judging the relationship\nbetween what they do and what happens.'. It is the\nProfessor Marsden is working on refining the\ntechnique which is so sensitive that something as\napparently insignificant as the thickness of the needle\nused can affect whether a graft takes or not. He\nblames the press for raising sufferers' hopes and\ndriving researchers to work faster than they should\nhave done.\nAt the moment, it can take up to six aborted\nfoetuses to provide enough material to treat one\npatient. However, it may be possible in the future, to\nreplace these with genetically altered skin cells or\nclones of brain cells taken from a single foetus.\nnon-depressed who distort the evidence: they tend to\nbe over-optimistic.\nDr Fisher, perhaps over-optimistically, does not\nconclude that life is genuinely a bad deal which most\npeople seem to be able to ignore. Instead depression\nmay be a biological trick to avoid trouble.\nIn any society, 'losers' try not to confront 'winners'.\nBy publicly understating their abilities, depressive\n'losers' are able to control sensitive situations without\ncausing trouble with those of higher 'rank'.\nThe technique can get out of control: a person who\nsays 'I'm no good' too often may eventually end up\nunnecessarily maintaining a reputation for being\nincompetent.\nSadder but wiser?\n\n"

They are\nexponents of 'heavy grunge' rock, a bit like Husker\nDu or perhaps Motorhead with a little sophistication.\n(A pity really as Motorhead's charm is their lack of\nsophistication.) It is raw, unpretentious stuff,\nperformed in a workmanlike fashion by the four piece\nNirvana and whilst it does not have anything special\nto distinguish it from the rest of this genre it satisfies\nthe market. There are a few gutsy screams from\nvocalist Kurdt Kolan, particularly on Scoff and the\ncuriously titled Floyd the Besler, the occasional guitar\nriff and a rhythm section with the energy of a blacksmith on speed. As 'melody' and 'tune' are not\nfactors here, modem popular music is unlikely to be\ntransformed by Nirvana but they could teach Guns W Roses a thing or two about heavy rock.\nPhillip Boa\nA German, over whom the serious music papers are\napparently having orgasms, Container Love, out on\nPolydor is a totally unmemorable dirge in which Phil\ngrunts like a tramp and his partner Pia trys to sound\nlike a bored supermarket checkout girl. It lacks the\nblandness of the SAW drum machine but at least\nSinita trys not to sound like the shop assistant.\nHe's probably so intelligent that he gains his\ninspiration from Stravinski and Schoenberg in which\ncase he'll never make the Top 40.

One is not quite 'a flower in a forest of weeds'\nbut is a three piece who can play and sing a decent\ntoon and will probably fail to trouble the DJs at Radio\n1 at all. However this is what pop should be.\nDanceable with half-way intelligent and intelligible\nlyrics, it features no female orgasms, sexual innuendo\nand a no hope dance remix on the flip-side. Thoroughly\nrecommended all round even though they are\nreminiscent of Lloyd Cole at times.\nJethro Tull\nHammersmith Odeon\n21 years on from their conception, Jethro Tull are still\ngoing strong, oblivious to musical fashion and\npromoting a new LP Rock Island.\nTo the fore is Ian Anderson, still manic ally snorting\nand grunting into his flute whilst standing on one leg\nor singing of farming problems and lecherous tramps\nby the name of Aqualung. His lechery is even less\nrepressed nowadays judging by the slick show that\naccompanied Kissing Willie or the scantily clad woman\nwho showed us her 'Wisp of cotton panties' during\nNight in Budapest.\nSupported by Dave Pegg and Martin Alcock (now\nthe driving force behind Fairport Convention), Doane\nPerry and Martin Borne, Tull seem to have found a stable line-up. Borne, beard less for the first time ever,\nnow has p retention s as an axe-hero and indulged in\nenough posturing to make up for the others' lack of\nit, but it was the enjoyment with which they all played\naround in between numbers which made the show\nintimate. Alcock's 'coal driven' keyboards running out\nof steam and Perry's 'violin miming' made the concert\nan occasion to be remembered rather than over-rehearsed video effects that many concerts have now\nbecome.\nMaterial from Rock Island, a patchy collection of\nfamiliar ideas was eclipsed by older songs with an\nemphasis still on the 'album of '73'. Aqualung Huron\n43 and Cheap Day Return now being Tull standards\nand Locomotive Bxxxx acting as an encore, as usual.\nThe Renaissance of the old rock stars has covered the\nfact that Tull never stopped doing it and will probably\ncontinue long after the Stones break up again.\nPage 11\n\n"

I am not talking about the\nofficial prospectus; I am talking about Olave House.\nJohn Smith promised that last year's purchase of\nOlave House would not burden the residence system\nand would therefore have no effect on rents in other\nhalls such as Southside and Evelyn Gardens. I believe\nthis promise. Sadly, Mr Smith will be leaving the\nCollege after Christmas and the hoods in Sherfield are\ngoing to do their best to see otherwise. Malcolm\nAldridge has said that he expects to see the house\nenter into the Residence system this year, if Students\nResidence Committee agrees to it.

    "content": "In April 1953, Francis Crick and James Watsonformally announced their\ndiscovery ofthe famous double-helix structure for DNA. Since then, the\nscience of Genetics has advanced in leaps and bounds. It is now on the\nedge of 'big science'.\nThe Handbook\nof Man\nEvolution may be the most successful of all scientific\ntheories but recent research casts doubt on one of the\nfundamental principles upon which the modern theory\nis based.\nThe work, by Dr. Jeffrey Pollard of the Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine, suggests that it may be\npossible to overcome 'Weismann's Barrier,'\nAugust Weismann, working in the late 19th century, suggested that what he called the\n'germ plasm', material carrying genetic information\ncan only be passed directly from one generation to the\nnext. In effect there is a biological barrier against\n'foreign' material. Any changes between generations\nmust therefore be the result of either the shuffling of\nexisting material or random errors in its replication.\nWeismann's theories eventually lead to the downfall\nof the 'Lamarkian' theory of evolution. This theory,\nnamed after a19 th century French biologist, had\nmany followers including Charles Darwin himself, and\nstated that it may be possible by some unknown\nmeans for parents to modify the genetic material\npassed on to their offspring to give them some\nbiological advantage.\nSince the days of Wiesmann and Lamark the\nscience of genetics has made a number of major leaps\nforward, not least the discovery of the structure of\nBreaking\nevolution's barriers\nDNA. Most of this research seemed to show that\ngenetic material is effectively stable, protected by\nWeismann's barrier, and accurately copied between\ngenerations. This gave rise to the modern 'Neo-Darwinist' theory of evolution in which only the\nprinciple of 'survival of the fittest' applies.\nHowever, recent work, including that of Dr. Pollard,\nsuggests that genetics may be more flexible than\npreviously thought. Molecules of DNA have been seen\nto grow and shrink and move around within the\nchromosomes which hold them. They may even pick\nup material from external sources such as viruses.\nTo Dr. Pollard this is a strategy for survival. He\nbelieves that it is possible for life-forms to speed up\nevolution by copying their DNA inaccurately,\nsomething which has already been observed in certain\nbacteria. It may also be possible for higher animals to\nalter the genes of sperm and egg cells in response to\nchanges in the environment.\nDr. Pollard believes that controversial experiments\nusing 'harmless' viruses to transfer new genetic\nmaterial into cells could back up his work. He does\nnot, however, advocate a return to pure Lamarkism.\nIn his version of evolution survival of the fittest is still\nthe most powerful influence-all he has done is put\na few holes in Weismann's barrier.\nThe human genome is what carries the information\nwhich makes us what we're. It is in effect the\n'Handbook of Man' and, according to Sir Walter\nBodmer the director of research at the Imperial Cancer\nResearch Fund, within 15 years it may have been\ndecoded.\nDNA, the basic stuff of life, contains within it's famous double helix a long sequence consisting of just\nfour basic constituents or bases. It takes 3,000 million\nbases to define a human being, divided into 46\nchromosomes. Inherited diseases are faults in this\nsequence: sickle cell anaemia, the blocking of arteries\nby misshapen blood cells, is known to be caused by\none error in a146 base sequence. Other conditions\nsuch as Muscular Distrophy and Arthritis have been\ntraced to defective genes. Cancer is known to be a 'genetic flaw'.\nYet, despite these successes, geneticists have\ndecoded only a tiny part of the total sequence. Sir\nWalter and his colleagues in the Human Genome\nOrganisation (HUGO) believe that the way forward\nwill be to unscramble the rest.\nThis gigantic international project could cost as\nmuch as \u00a32 billion spread over all the countries\ninvolved. Not much, said Sir Walter, compared with\n'the odd trident missile or the take-over of just one\nAmerican hotel chain'\nThe problem has been likened to taking fragments\nof text from a dictionary and, by finding out where\nthey overlap, piecing the complete dictionary back\ntogether. Some experts believe that this will need\ncomputers 10,000 times faster than those in use\ntoday.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "'My drawing isn't bad, and I like the sound of this comic business.\nWhere can I learn more?' The answer is the London Cartoon\nCentre.\nCapital cartoon\nUnless you've been out of the country for the last year\nor so, you will no doubt have noticed the amount of\nmedia attention that comics have been attracting.\nWith the Batman film and the rising prominence of\nmore mature, 'adult' comics such as Deadline and\nCrisis, the public eye has been forced upon this unique\nart form as never before. Several major book publishers\nare now entering the fray with extensive plans for\ncomic projects.\n\"Hold on\", you may say. \"My drawing isn't bad,\nand I like the sound of this comic business. Where can\nI learn more?\" Well, surprisingly, the only place in\nEurope that offers specific training in comic strip art\nis the North Kensington based London Cartoon\nCentre.\nThe Cartoon Centre grew out of a workshop started\nin 1984 by David Moran, who was convinced that\nthere must be talented young people in his area who\ncould draw original cartoons for a newsletter produced\n(under his guidance) by a local youth club. After a few\nunsatisfactory tutors, David Lloyd, artist of the\nacclaimed series 'V for Vendetta', was asked to find\nsomeone suitable. He decided to have a go himself,\nand from there the Cartoon Workshop gradually\nexpended to become the Cartoon Centre, gathering\nenough support from the Portobello Trust, the\nEuropean Social Fund and D.C. Comics to be able to\nhire a full-time co-or d in at or, Eve Stickler.\nToday, with an impressive roster of experienced\ncomic artists and illustrators for tutors, the Centre\noffers a range of evening classes covering all aspects\nof comics creation: strip illustration, script writing,\nhumour scripts, anatomy and life drawing, with hopes\nto start colouring and animation courses in the near\nfuture.\nA new development instigated by Ms Stickler is a daytime course running for two and a half days a week\nover ten weeks, comprised of the basic elements of\nthe evening classes plus advice on setting up in\nbusiness as a cartoonist.\nEvery term 'Masterclasses' are arranged featuring\ntop name professionals such as Alan Moore, Dave\nGibbons and Paul Neary talking about their techniques\nand looking at students' work.\nIn June the Cartoon Centre moved into new,\npurpose built premises in the Portobello Trust Business\nCentre, which provide good working space and\nequipment essential to budding Steve Bells, such as\na light box, a guillotine and a photocopier-the last\nbeing used to produce the students' showcase\nmagazine, Silicon Fish.\nIf the ultimate aim of the Cartoon Centre is to teach\ntheir students the skills necessary to make a living in\ncomics and related fields, there can be no doubt of\nits success. Many of the graduates have gone on to\nprofessional work: Martin Griffiths and Darren\nGoodacre work for 2000AD, Dougie Brithwaite has\nbeen published in A1 and is drawing The American\nfor Dark Horse Comics, Nick Abadzis draws Hugo\nTate for Deadline, and Denise Dean is working for\nUniversal Studios on American Tail II, to name a few.\nAn interesting project which the Cartoon Centre is\ninvolved in is a collaboration with Amnesty\nInternational. The plan is for representatives of\nAmnesty and some of the Centre tutors to talk to\nvarious GCSE Art classes about human rights\nviolations and drawing comics respectively. Then, as\npart of their GCSE exam, the pupils will have to\nproduce a comic strip about a particular human rights\ncase. Hopefully the results of this will demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of comics as an educational tool and\nat the same time heighten awareness of Amnesty's work.\nTo attend the London Cartoon Centre you must be\nunder 26. The evening classes cost \u00a31.50 each (soon\nto rise to \u00a32.00). Send photocopies of your artwork\nand/or scripts to Eve Stickler at the London Cartoon\nCentre, 249-251 Kensal Road, London W10 5DB, or\nphone her on 01-969 4562 and arrange an\nappointment. Let the longer haired of you be warned:\nMs Stickler has a penchant for tugging pony-tails!\nRichard Crouch.\n\n"

    "content": "The summer is always quiet according to those who would like to make you think so. But the College trie\nto pull a fast one on the Union and the Summer Accommodation Centre got washed out\nOAP PM saw IC's IRCs\nThe Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher, MP, visited\nCollege on August 25. In a brief interview with FELIX,\nshe explained that she was visiting the College's Interdisciplinary Research Centres, which she\ndescribed as 'fundamental and very exciting.'\nMrs Thatcher visited two of the College's three\nIRCs, which will bring a total of \u00a332 million to the\nCollege. 'It's very exciting,' she commented\nafterwards, 'what we do both in the basic and the\nprivate research really will have a tremendous effect\non the whole future success of our country.'\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, told FELIX that he\nhad invited Mrs Thatcher to view the IRCs after she\nhad expressed an interest to Professor Abdus Salaam\nin the Physics Department. The centres are in\npopulation biology, Process Simulation and control\n(Chem Eng) and Semiconductors.\nMrs Thatcher is known to be unsure about the\nvalidity of IRCs as a research tool. Professor Ash now\nbelieves she thinks 'this is the right way to go.'\nInterdisciplinary Research Centres work in an interdepartmental manner, drawing ideas and resources\nfrom several areas at once.\nBookstore lost \u00a375,000\nThe Imperial College Union Bookstore's losses\nexceeded original estimates by \u00a375,000 when a full\nstock take was held during the Summer.\nThe amount was made up by unsold books which\ncould not be returned to suppliers. Past stock\nvaluations had quoted non-returnable, out of date\ntextbooks at full price less a profit margin. An example\nquoted was 'A history of Persian Earthquakes,' which\nwas valued at \u00a350 in the accounts and was selling\nin the Bookstore at \u00a310-20.\nThe loss was originally higher, but was reduced by\nthe return of \u00a325,000 worth of books. It came as an\naddition to the Bookstore's \u00a330,000 overdraft and the\nUnion's \u00a367,000 refurbishment costs.\nUnion Manager, Dave Peacock told FELIX that he\ndid not expect the Bookstore to repay the debts for\nten years.\nImpact hit Bookstore\nThe College increased the rent on the Union Bookstore\nfrom \u00a34,700 to 19,000 when its rent negotiators,\n'Impact,' were employed to arrange an 'arms length'\nagreement between the Union and the College.\nCollege Secretary and 'Impact' director, John Smith\naccepted that the new rent was 'a bit tough on the\nBookshop,' but added that the new arrangements\nprovided 'much sharper objectives.'\nWith a good year, Union Manager, Dave Peacock,\ntold FELIX that he expected a profit of \u00a340,000,\nwhich would have been halved by the new rent.\nThe new rent was part of the College's policy to\nincrease rents around the campus, including that of\nNational Westminster Bank. The policy was decided\nby the College's Management and Planning\nCommittee\nSAC in hot water\nA mix-up between the Summer Accommodation\nCentre and the College's Estates section left 56 rooms\nflooded in Southside in September.\nThe hot water supply to the halls had been\ndisconnected overnight and during the day to 'repair\na burst main,' according to Managing Surveyor of\nResidences, Peter Hallworth.\nMr Hallworth told FELIX that everyone in the halls\nhad received a leaflet warning them of the imminent\ndisconnection. Several residents left their hot water\ntaps running however.\nSpeaking on the incident, Conference organiser,\nPauline Clark, said, 'No, I still haven't been informed\nofficially that the water was to be switched off.' She\nadded that the staff at the Summer Accommodation\nCentre's reception desk had not been informed either.\nShe described the leafleting of the halls as 'minimal,'\nand added that the residents had 'thought it was a rather a hoot!'\nUFC success\nImperial succeeded in gaining a nationwide top\nresearch ranking in all of the departments reviewed\nby the University Funding Council over the summer.\nThe new ratings placed IC 3rd in the national table of\nUniversities with 91.25% of the possible marks.\nThe UFC now aim to give a double weighting to\nresearch excellence, which Professor Ash expects to\nprovide a 'sizeable fraction of a million (pounds),' in\nfuture years. 'It won't drastically change our fortunes\novernight,' he added.\nNew ICU staff\nIC Union appointed ex-ULU Vice President, Louise Van\nder Straeten as Assistant Finance Officer in August.\nThe new permanent staff post is to be paid for by the\nUnion's outlets and its central account.\nUnion President, Neil McCluskey, now hopes that\nFinance Officer, Reggie Blennerhassett will be able to\ndevote more of his time to the management\naccounting he was employed to do originally.\nMary's refit\nSt Mary's Student Union had its bar and main hall\nrefitted during the Summer. The cost of the refit was\nmet by the Medical School and St Mary's Student\nUnion.\nThe main hall, which had not been refurbished since\nthe 1960's is used as a refectory and houses events\nduring the evenings.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "What really goes on at political conferences? What do all those delegates do when not grabbing th\nminutes of fame before the TV cameras. Andy Waller walked down the middle of the road to the Soc\nLiberal Democratic conference to find out. Salad days\nWhat better way is there to wind up your summer\nholiday than going to a political conference? I suppose\nthere are at least several million better ways, but this\nis a report from someone who was silly enough to\njump onto the nearest Rapide coach and head down\nto Brighton at the beginning of September.\nSecurity is one of the major headaches at any major\nconference these days and it certainly caused me\nsome problems. Arriving to register heavily laden with\nsuitcase and sleeping bag I was promptly told 'You\ncan't go in there with those'. However I couldn't take\nthem direct to my digs as I needed to collect the key\nfrom the Youth Stall inside the conference centre.\nDeadlock: and my shoulders didn't feel that much\nalive-if only I hadn't listened to my mother\nsuggesting that extra jumper. A kindly porter at the\nGrand Hotel (conveniently next door) said that I could\nleave them in the lobby until I got my key.\nThat problem sorted out, I ventured around the\nsights and sounds of the various stalls in the\nconference centre. I thought that British Nuclear Fuels\nwere wasting their time, but I did get a rather nice\ntelescopic key ring/ pen off them. Wandering around,\nthere were yet more freebies to be had: a free sewing\nkit, pen and key ring from the Royal Bank of\nScotland-at least I now had my key to put on the\nkey rings.\nThere are several bars in the Brighton Centre and\nin trying to find one of them open I stumbled across\nthe conference hall where (horror of horrors) someone\nI knew was making a rather silly speech. So I left: it\nwas only the English Federal Conference, a sort of\nwarm-up session to the real thing. By then it was time\nto check-in and chat with one of the major political\ncommentators of our day-a taxi driver. He admitted\nthat he had once voted for us in the past but enquired\nas to why anyone bothered to have a conference\nwhen there wasn't going to be a General Election for\nsuch a long time, and whether we had already sorted\nout how the votes were going to go during the\nfollowing week. I said that we weren't that sort of\na party. Luckily we then reached Brighton Poly Halls.\nWhat on earth is there to do at a party conference?\nThis being my first proper one, it took me a few days\nto work out the rules.\n1. Wander about looking as though you know what\nyou are doing, and saying a brief hello to whoever you\ncan remember from the last conference, by-election,\ncouncil meeting or breakfast. When you have been\nthrough everyone once then start again trying to get\non television doing it.\n'SOCIAL1\nr& LIBERAL\"\nDEMOCRATS:\n2. Put in 30 million speaker's cards in the hope that\nyou will get called and then hurriedly learn the speech\nyou wrote on the bus that morning.\n3. Go to as many free lunches or buffets as you can.\nAs for rule three, whilst it is party policy to deplore\nany 'political' expenditure on pre-privatisation\nadvertising by the major utilities like water and\nelectricity, this does not stop you from eating any free\nfood or beer on offer.\nPaddy Ashdown's first speech to the conference\nbegan in Mandarin (from his days in the Special Boat\nService) which has to be a first. The full conference\nwas opened on the Monday morning by the Mayor of\nBrighton. There followed some interesting debates\nand some not so interesting debates. Whilst it is\nflattering for a political party to have extensive live\ncoverage on television, I wonder who actually\nwatches it, apart from the few thousand party faithful\nor Aunt Flo who has been tipped off that her darling\nnephew/niece is about to make a major controversial\nspeech in a pull-over she knitted them for Christmas.\nOn Monday afternoon I dutifully bought my specially\nsigned copy of David Steel's autobiography. It was\nalso possible to get other books signed by their\nauthors. I suppose it was sheer coincidence that all\nthese books by the party hierarchy came out at about\nthe time of the conference. After all, ours is not a cynical party, is it?\nTuesday saw the big guns being brought out for\n(yes, the clich e gave it away) the defence debate.\nTrident was accepted ready for the next General\nElection, along with the rest of a paper on East-West\nrelations. The policy process is currently 'de liber at ive' i.e. preliminary papers are prepared, discussed,\namended and then passed, rather than being made on\nthe hoof. There was an attempt to alter this and the\ndebate produced the memorable quote \"Take a look\nat the person sitting next to you, does she look like\na Trot?\". Well personally I hadn't thought of Ian\nWrigglesworth's former secretary in quite that\ncontext.\nEvery day each delegate was bombarded by\nhundreds of leaflets, papers and documents and so\nwith environmental concerns being at the heart of the\nparty our Councillors from Adur (just down the road)\nprovided eco-bins to recycle all this waste paper.\nThe press seemed to be covering a completely\ndifferent conference and one enlightening story came\nfrom the Youth Stall where someone was approached\nby a Today reporter who wanted a comment about\nPaddy Ashdown allegedly taking up a very large suite\nin the Grand at the Party's expense. It transpired that\nhe had already written the article about the Youth\nWing's indignation before he arrived.\nWe were also all alarmed to hear that Sir Russel\nJohnson (MP for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber) was\nabout to resign as Whip. He did say that he hadn't even spoken to the press, but the bright young thing\nof the old SDP, Charles Kennedy, said that it was his\nown fault to be misquoted by saying nothing at all.\nThursday night saw the traditional sing song and\nperhaps the best contribution to the name debate\ncoming from a rendition of 'Socialiberaldemo-crat ice xp i ally do cio us'. Other amusing ditties included\n'0 Pad, our help in ages past/Our hope for months to\ncome/Take thy computer in both hands/And stick it...'\nto the tune \"0 Lord, our help in ages past\", which\ngoes to show that even a 'non-conformist' party\nknows tunes from 'Ancient and Modern'.\nFinally came the speech they had all been waiting\nfor. The adoring members, and even those with woolly\npullovers (of which there could only have been a handful), sat and listened to Paddy's Leadership\nSpeech. The standing ovation would have lasted\nlonger, only I think Baroness Sear wanted to sit down\nafter five minutes.\nHomeward bound with my SLD rock, Paddy pen and\nother memorabilia, it did cross my mind that several\nof my friends would consider me slightly mad for\nhaving been to a party conference, but nevertheless\nit's Blackpool next year for me.\nPage 12\n\n"

Not only does\nit afford us another glimpse of Calypso Grant, on\nwhom the curtain was lifted in The Camomile Lawn\nand who last played a part in The Vacillations of Poppy Carew. It also opens up a whole new cast of quirky\ncharacters, in typically vivid colours.\nThe plot centres on Claud Bannister, 25,\nunemployed, back at home with mother, dreaming of\nwriting a novel and Laura Thornby, 45 (the ages are\nimportant). Exotic, independent and controlled, she\nruns her own life, enjoys men and discards them\n(charmingly) before they go sour. Laura takes Claud\non, sets him up with a market stall and encourages\nhim away from mother to write. But the relationship\ndoes not proceed quite as she expects.\nThe dynamics of their relationship are played out\nin a kaleidoscope of scenes which also illuminate\naspects of Laura's past and her family, and of Claud's mother's mind, marriage and maternity, as well as\nintroducing a team of comic characters, including the\ndeliciously dreadful Terrence. The novel exposes the\nprocess of writing a novel and (with a characteristic\nturn of wit) the process of writing book reviews.\nThe language is spare and pungent. The rhythm is\nir resist able. The characters are engaging, the wit is\nsharp, the plot is intriguing. Highly recommended.\nLorraine Rogerson.\nThe Bellarosa\nConnection\nSaul Bellow\nPub. Penguin \u00a33.50\nThe aging memory man forgets the name of the river\nin the song he learnt as a child. His friend and step-cousin Harry Fonstein has spent forty years forgetting\nhis Jewish origins but trying to thank the man who\nrescued him from the Nazis, now a successful\nBroadway producer, Billy Rose (Bellarosa).\nFonstein's wife, the tiger lady Sorella, a Gentile,\nwho has made herself an expert on Jewish history,\nhas the means to bl d ck mail the reluctant Billy Rose\ninto allowing her husband to thank him. She has been\ngiven the diaries of a female former aide of the\nproducer, but after confronting him with them,\ndestroys them.\nAs Saul Bellow gets older his novels seem to get\nshorter; this one, described by the publishers as a novella, is really an extended short story, with its\nsingle theme of memory and its relation to history. The\ncharacters are highly drawn, and Bellow eschews plot\nwith a Nobel Prize winner's confidence, but the terse\ndescription and dialogue are enough to evoke the\nAmerica of 'Herzog' and 'Dangling Man'. Bellow's fiction is unforgettable.\nTrying to trace the Fonsteins thirty years after losing\ntouch with them, the memory man remembers\n'Swannee' (or 'Suwannee'-spelling preferred in the\nSouth) and learns of their deaths.\nB.A. Costello.\nJob Hunting Alfred Hassack\nPenguin 'Self-Starter' \u00a33.99\nNow that your grant cheque has been pissed away\nat the Freshers' Week events and you discover that\nyour landlord, one Mr Rachman, is a stickler for\nprompt monthly payments, it's time to join the\npioneering cohorts of nineties students and get out\nand earn some do sh. And here's your edge: you're competitors for that\nsought after post at the local ale house are obviously\na bunch of losers who hadn't the wit to prepare for\nthe inevitable eyeball with the boss with the latest\nself-instructional training in transactional analysis and\nthe high art of fast-talked bullshit.

Penguin \u00a33.99\nwell to you promises well that it can then sell you to\nMr Big and his merry band of moderately remunerated\nmen. This book makes a fair job of it (pun intended).\nAimed at a broad audience the chapter regarding\nCVs is a bit of a shock including as it does formats\nfor those various forms of real life without a university\neducation (those who also must work). The\nsubsequent chapters on interview preparation and its\npop-psychology are a suitably commonsense pep talk\nfor all those of a thick-skinned/socially incompetent\npersuasion.\nOverall, although quite d is pensi ble as a tool of any\ngreat enlightenment the book gives a clear simple\ncheck list and serves its intended function to calm and\ngroom the potential victim before the sacrificial\npresentation to the big bad interview day.\nMAC.\nWhatever else this novel's about it is about the fun\nof camaraderie and the richness of friendship-the\npleasures of 'having the crack'. The crack is the crazy\nspirit of a night hunted down drunk, and drained of\nits sparkle then thrown to the side with the empties.\nThe crack is the wit of the Irish and the nightly quest\nof a wide-eyed wide boy from N22 for that elusive\nsomething more.\nFrom under-age drinking in a pub in Camden Town\nthrough sexual skirmishes in the B& Bs of\nBournemouth, Tony is riding the crest of a wave which\ncarries him almost as far as his passionate vague\nambitions.\nWith the wit of Joe Kelly and the sharp edge of\nbright and bold Diamond, the boys have divined the\nspirit of the times, or at least of living in London, and\nin a party of drink, drugs and sounds Pleasure\nIncorporated is born.\nThe anarchic crusade of the hedonists' vision is\nlaunched, and with a cool mix of blarney and balls the\ngospel of good time is spread. After London, New\nYork and Tokyo bow to the pirates flag.\nThrough the dollars and a death and the loss of his\nEnglish Rose a big-hearted man is made from a bright\nfaced boy. From these fond memories of a lusty life\nand 'getting drunk in the company of honest men',\nTony can now look forward with the contented smirk\nof a man who has had his cake and still has another\nslice left.\nBetter than the blind rebellion of angry young men\nand brighter than the self destruction of the\ndisillusioned, this novel opens an unseen door in the\nwriting of recent times which leads to a more positive\npath for those 'In Search of the Crack'.\nMAC.\nThe Oat and Wheat Bran\nHealth Plan\nDina R. Jewell and C. Thomas Jewell M.D. Pub. Bantam Books \u00a33.99\nThis book otherwise known as Crapping Your Way to\nHealth delivers the final panacea to that gamut of ills\npeculiarly favoured by the constipated western world\nsuch as:\nCoronary artery disease\nAppendicitis\nColon cancer\nBreast cancer\nHiatal hernia\nVaricose veins\nDepression\nand many more besides. I 've been on the diet for\na fortnight now and can honestly tell you that in this\ntime I 've suffered from none of these ills so that can't be bad for a first indication.\nBut I should mention, there are certain drawbacks\nto the plan. The main problem being that the diet\nconsists of lots of visits to the toilet to deposit your\nnew, more bulky, fast transit time, cholesterol\nremoving number twos.\nHowever, this is surely a small price to pay for such\na healthy, en erg ising cleansing effect that these little\nfibrous treats can bring to your life. Or at least that's the message that enthusiast and High-Fibre-Priestess\nDina relates in her endearingly spunky American way.\nThe book is clearly planned and presented and the\ntone of address is set for an intelligent interested lay\naudience. From the beginnings of research in Africa\non the importance of dietary fibre through a summary\nof the physical and chemical effects of oat and wheat\nbran s the text leads into the bulk of the book where\nthe practical business of getting the stuff down your\nthroat in a suitably app et ising way is covered by a comprehensive list of recipe ideas.\nAn interesting substitute for the traditional diet of\nmany beers and a curry but whether the medical basis\nwill be wiped out by an article in next month's Lancet\nin the time honoured manner of these things, remains\nto be seen. Meanwhile stock up on bog roll.\nMAC.\nPage 4\n\n"

    "content": "College backs down over\nbookstore rent\nThe College has backed down over plans to\nincrease the rent of the Imperial College Union Bookshop from \u00a34,700 per annum to \u00a319,000.\nThe rent will now be equal to last year's rent\nplus inflation.\nThe plan is yet to be agreed, and 'Impact',\nwho represent the College, are still negotiating.\nCollege Secretary Mr John Smith, told FELIX 'nobody wanted to do down the bookshop or Union'. He added 'the Union had put more into\nit than originally thought'. He also commented\nthat 'It's important for the people who run it\ncommercially to know what a commercial rent\nis in this neighbour-hood\u2014the space is very\nvaluable'.\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, justified the\nchange of mind\u2014Tt was felt that the higher rent\nwould be unnecessarily hard on the Bookstore',\nhe told FELIX. Last Friday's meeting between the Union\nPresident, Neil McCluskey, Mr John Smith and\nProfessor Eric Ash yielded the draught solution.\nThe original aim of raising the rent was because\nthe old Bookshop was non-departmental\u2014a non-College based activity' as Impact described it.\nIt was pointed out that Southside Bar paid no\nrent at all and is even more non-departmental\nthan the bookshop. Impact is an impartial\nagency, so a rent rise in one sector must be\naccompanied by a rise in any comparable areas.\nRefectories Manager Mr Rob Northey, who\nis responsible for Southside Bar, commented\nthat any change in the rent on Southside Bar\nwould probably be reflected in bar prices. The\nUnion bar also pays no rent, he added.\nSee summer news review\nTheft: Hamsoc lose \u00a32,500\nAn estimated \u00a32,500 worth of equipment has\nbeen stolen from HamSoc, Imperial College\nUnion's amateur radio society. The missing\nitems include trance ivers worth about \u00a32,000\nand various other equipment, including\nantennae.\nThe robbery is thought to have happened\nsometime last week after electricians employed\nby the College had been working near the\nHamsoc room. It is believed that they left a door\nopen. The theft was only discovered on Tuesday\nwhen Hamsoc members started to prepare for\nthe Freshers' Fair.\nThe Union Deputy President Dave Williams\nsaid the articles were uninsured and that 'as far\nas I'm concerned the College Estates are paying\nfor it'.\nThe theft occurred during the day, and is\nthought to have involved a number of trips to\nand from the room. Dave Williams has now\ninstructed that he be told before a contractor is\nleft in any of the Union Buildings.\nMr Geoff Reeves College Chief Security\nOfficer, added that no one is sure of when the\ntheft actually took place, but it must have taken\nsome time. He said that the back door of the\nUnion, facing the Albert Hall, is to be fixed with\na magnetic lock, but cannot be locked\npermanently as it is a fire door.\nIn a later interview Dave Williams told\nFELIX that it 'looked like' the door had been\nleft open. T believe it is not insured' he added.\nStudents to fund College\ncock-up?\nCollege's residence fund may have to support\nthe \u00a31.6 million Olave Hous:, according to\nSenior Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm Aldridge. The House's finances are presently\nkept separate from the main Residence Account,\nunder an agreement, made between the College\nand Imperial College Union (ICU), designed to\nlimit rent increases in other residences.\nAround \u00a31 million of the cost of the new\nHouse was raised through a loan, with the rest\nof the money coming from the Sherfield Trust.\nIt was decided at the time of purchase to pay\nthe interest on the loan entirely from the Olave\nHouse rents, in order to avoid burdening\nstudents in other residences. Following the\nrecent interest rate increases, the \u00a350-60 rents\nare no longer sufficient for this and the loan is\nsteadily increasing. It has also been estimated\nthat the value of Olave House has fallen to \u00a31\nmillion, in line with property price trends.\nCommenting on his policy toward rent\nincreases, Mr Aldridge told FELIX' My objective is to keep pace with inflation' but did\nnot rule out the possibility of increases greater\nthan the rate of inflation. If Olave House is\nadded to the Residence Account, all rents may\nsee a substantial rise in order to ensure that the\nHouse breaks even financially.\nCollege Secretary John Smith denied that\nthere are any plans to bring Olave House into\nthe Residence Account. He stated his intention\nto uphold the College's agreement with the\nUnion and said that he thought Olave House\nrents are 'about right for the nature of the\naccommodation'.\nMr Smith, who recommended the purchase\nof the House to the Sherfield Trust, remarked\n'I still think it's a good buy in the long term'.\nNeil M cCl us key, Imperial College Union\nPresident, reacted with surprise to the proposal\nthat Olave House should be financed from the\ngeneral Residence Account. T will stick to any\nagreement made and I do believe that the\nagreement was that any residence bought after\nFisher Hall would be kept separate from the\nResidence Acount', he said.\n\n"

    "content": "Nightline\neviction\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to you following your article on the\neviction of Nightline by College at the end of the year.\nFirstly the comments attributed to Neil McCluskey\nwhich implied that as he'd never had cause to use\nNightline the money spent on it could be better used\nelsewhere were, I hope, taken out of context and\nsurely can't reflect official Union policy.\nNightline provides a valuable listening and\ninformation service throughout the night for anyone\nto use. It is run for students in London by students\nfrom London and as such is uniquely suited to student\nneeds. I found Neil's comments ill thought out and\noffensive to an organisation whose volunteers, by\nnature of their anonymity, can get no outside\nrecognition for the effort they put in.\nBy repossessing the Nightline Office College gains\naccommodation for up to three students which will\nrequire both work and money to be brought up to a suitable standard for year round occupation.\nNightline will lose secure premises in an area which\nis relatively safe for its volunteers to travel to and from\nand is ideally located in a central area for volunteers\nfrom all the different colleges to get to. It would lose\nits internal phone line which means that IC students\nwould no longer be able to use the service on the\ninternal system form any hall or College phone.\nThe argument that it's someone else's turn to house\nNightline is a poor one. Couldn't another college\nprovide accommodation for three IC students rather\nthan destroying what is a near ideal set up at Imperial\nand jeo pardi sing the future of one of the largest\nstudent Nightlines in the country.\nPeople, particularly Union Presidents, must realise\nthat as anonymity is a pre-requisite of Nightline it\nmakes defending it very hard. Rather than just letting\nthis eviction take place I would ask all those involved\nto try and come up with viable alternatives and protect\nan organisation that cannot publicly protect itself.\nName and address withheld.\nMolto\nfascist i Dear Dave,\nIsn't it funny how nothing ever seems to change?\nThe subject of this venting of spleen on my part is\nthe wonderfully neutral and informative booklet\nfoisted on the new intake by that well-known bastion\nof tolerance, the Imperial College Conservative\nSociety, a group of individuals so devoted to market\nforces that they cannot even bring themselves to use\nthe word 'Union' in their own title, despite the\nshameful fact that the Union funds them, and that\nthey are all members of it.\nWhat have they done? Well, what do you expect?\nThey have once again launched them elves on a crusade to worm their insidious propaganda into the\nminds of the gentle and the innocent. A campaign of\nspiteful half-truth, poisonous generalisation and blind\nself-satisfaction, prompted by a typical 'I'm alright\nJack' attitude, and directed at the usual targets such\nas Socialists, members of the NUS (not all of whom\nattend or applaud wasteful conferences, no platform\npolicies or the IRA) and the poor old homosexuals,\nappears to be the standard opening shot in what will\nalmost certainly be an increasingly ignorant and\nuncaring year.\nThe old Federation of Conservative Students was\nrightly regarded as a gross political embarrassment by\nthe current government. We can see very easily that\nonly the name has changed: The willful blindness and\nvicious intolerance are just the same.\nI have no doubt that the Conservative Society will:\na) Write to Conservative Head Office, naming me\nas a subversive, and\nb) Write a reply to this with several pages of\nstatistics proving the fairness of Student Loans and\nthe Community Charge. For an encore, they will then\neat the Queen's Tower and prove that the Moon is\nmade of blue cheese\nYours,\nAndy Bannister.\n-get out and about in London\nTOMORROW, 10.00am MEET AT YOUR CCU OFFICE\nFor further details please come to\nthe Rag Meeting today at 12.35 in\nthe Union Lounge\n\n"

    "content": "AUT pay claim\nThe national executive of the Association of University\nTeachers ( AUT) has recommended a salary claim of 27%\nfor LIniversity staff.\nThe document is being considered by AUT members and\nmay be adopted as policy at a special council meeting on Saturday 14th October. The AUT claim that the increase is\nneeded to 'halt the appalling decline in academic related\nsalaries over the past decade'.\nA spokesman for the AUT told FELIX that the claim was\n'high with respect to the last pay claim, but not with respect\nto comparable jobs' and that it was 'certainly not\nunreasonable'. She added that the Chancellor of the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and Principles ( CVC P) were\n'unlikely to award the full whack'. On the possibility of a strike she commented that such thoughts were 'weeks ahead'.\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, said that 'Academics are\ngrossly underpaid and it's about time the Government\nrealised this'. During the last AUT strike over pay claims\nProfessor Ash wrote a letter to The Times condemning the\nAUT' s action.\nPoll tax protest\nThe main event at yesterday's Union General Meeting was\nthe final Union policy on Poll Tax. An original motion,\nproposed by Mr Edgar Denny, of Socialist Worker Students\nSociety, was amended to call for the Union to 'support and\ncoordinate any lawful action against the Poll Tax.'\nThe original motion instructed the Union Executive to\nwrite to the College, demanding that they do not hand over\nnames to the Poll Tax Registrar. Mr Denny explained that\nhe did not actually expect the College authorities to comply,\nbut it would let them know the student position. No such\nletter will now be written according to the motion amended\nby Hal Calamvokis.\nOther matters included announcements of financial\nassistance for parents who put children into the day nursery\nand a new election for the IC Union Women's Officer\nfollowing Nicky Fox's resignation due to work pressure.\nWilly J deficit\nWillis-Jackson House is charging five pounds to each of last\nyear's residents to balance the \u00a3750 which was overspent\nlast year.\nMr Joe Cartwright, warden of Willis-Jackson House stated\nthat some of this deficit was due to overspending by the last\nwarden, so he was only responsible for about \u00a3580 of it. He\nblamed it on an error in the accounting system. 'I basically\nmade a mistake as to how much it would all cost' said Mr Cartwright.\nUnion President Neil McCluskey said 'If anyone complains\nthe Union will back them all the way'. Residence losses\nA loss of \u00a3175,000 was made on the Student Residence\nAccount's \u00a32.4 million turnover last year. This follows a \u00a3100,000 loss in the previous year.\nJohn Smith, College Secretary, to id FELIX that a large\nproportion of the money had been spent on bringing the\nresidences up to fire safety standards. He also commented\nthat money was being spent on improving the general\nstandard of accommodation, which would slightly reduce\nmaintenance costs in the future.\nMr Smith suggested that the continuing losses could be\nreduced by 'good management' of student residences, in\nparticular by reducing the number of rooms which are vacant\nat any given time. 'There are always opportunities to make\nthings better', he said, in defence of the past standard of\nmanagement.\nHonda founder\nMr Soichiro Honda, the founder of the Honda Motor\nCompany, visited the college on Tuesday for the first time\nsince being made a fellow of Imperial College on last year's Commemoration Day.\nThe last time Mr Honda came to college was in 1982 to\nview the site for the wind tunnel. With other members of\nthe Honda Foundation, the party visited the Honda sponsored\nwind tunnel in Aeronautics and demonstrations of Neural\nNetworks and Electrochromotography in Electrical\nEngineering. Following the departmental visits, the group\nlunched with the Rector.\nMr Honda is currently on a world tour, the next port of\ncall being a new car factory in Toronto, Canada. The Honda\nFoundation was formed after Mr Honda retired from the\nMotor Company in 1973, its activities are aimed at studying\nhuman problems with respect to the broader issues related\nto technological development.\nUnions surveyed\nThe Department of Education and Science officially released\nthe results of its survey into student unions last week. The\nreport, which is a factual analysis of the survey, has taken\nthree months to complete.\nA spokesperson from the DES said that the delay was to\nallow officials time to think carefully about policy, but he\n'didn't know exactly what influenced the publication date'.\nThe policy of Mr John MacGregor, Secretary of State for\nEducation, was outlined in his speech to the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals ( CVC P), in which he said\nthat no action was to be taken against the expenditure of student unions on political activities, as the survey showed\nthis to be only 0.5% of their annual budget.\nCouncil battle\nHammersmith and Fulham Borough Council is fighting a legal battle over their \u00a3400 million money market loss and\nthe council auditors claim that they may not be compelled\nto pay the debt. The council was acting outside its legal\npowers in speculating its \u00a36 billion in the first place they said.\nA spokesman told FELIX T don't think that Housing\nBenefit will be affected' but declined to comment pending\na court case.\nDramsoc success\nImperial College Union Dramatic Society's( ICDS)\nacclaimed Edinburgh production of Huis Clos by Jean-Paul\nSartre will be performed in the Union Concert Hall on Friday\n13th October. The production was described in The Scotsman\nas having 'admirably succeeded in providing both precise\nacting and a claustrophobic atmosphere'.\nThe performance will start at 8pm and tickets cost\n\u00a32.50/\u00a32.00. All enquiries should be directed to Adrian\nPagan on ext 3531 or3533. Big bang\n'The birth of the cosmos' was the title of a speech given by\nProfessor Paul Davies from the University of Newcastle on\nWednesday, in the Great Hall.\nHe gave an account of current thinking on the big bang,\nthe event that began our universe. He explained that this was\nnot just 'any old bang', but a well balanced affair which\ncontained enough explosive energy to prevent the universe\ncollapsing before life had a chance to appear, but not too\nmuch to spread its material too thinly.\nMotor mania\nCity & Guilds Motor Club are running a competition for\nbudding racing car drivers.

    "content": "Graham Swannell's Marrakech\nEvery once in a while it is fun to remind yourself how\nabysmal a play can be in order to fully appreciate just\nwhere the proverbial bottom of the barrel lies-and\nGraham Swannell's latest play is it.\nIf you picture the most tedious middling middle class\nsitcom you have ever zapped then this is it without\nthe benefit of a remote control or even indeed of an\ninterval (a wise tactical decision.)\nWalter, a failed landscape architect finds himself in\nthe position, obviously 'humiliating' and 'comic' for\na professional man such as he, of playing\nhousehusband to Vivien his wife-a minority survivor\nas a doctor still loyal to an ailing NHS (and very SDP\nwith it).\nAt the start of the play Walter has decided to hang\nup his rubber globes and escape to the red walled city\nof his shattered dreams-Marrakech-and write the\ngreat naval-contemplating novel that burgeons within.\nThe dreary but stunning Vivien wakes up in search of\na coffee and discovering him packing she wonders\nwhat all the fuss is about.\nThe incompetent and illiterate dross which follows\nplays like an im bec il' s guide to a gospel of middle class\ntenets and truisms. For example:\n1. men cannot cook\n2. women can cook\n3. when we were young we were wild\n4. now we are older we are wiser\n5. any aspirations beyond a semi and 2.4 kids are\nh ilia riou s and silly of course\n6. especially the idea of writing\n7. or come to that of travelling\n8. we must stick together\n9. this is the best of all possible worlds:-beautifully captured in the line \"you think you'll find\nRobert Royston's The Struggle\nLYRIC HAMMERSMITH\nSTUDIO Tel: 01-741 2311 for further details\nwhat you want in Marrakech.

His attempt to convince\nthe cast that the dialogue is of this planet has however\nobviously failed in Morag Hood's case as she\nsleepwalks Vivien's part in a painfully droning\nmonotone (throat problems perhaps?). Consequently\nGregory Floy's valiant attempt to make something of\nWalter is lost in an alternate recital of lines that could\nnever pass for conversation.

    "content": "With the discovery of further contributory factors, the erosion of the\nworld's atmosphere is becoming more and more imminent. The latest\ncomputer models predict that the surface temperature of the earth\ncould rise by three degrees by 2060. The world is warming,\nscientists are working and politicians are pan icing as they\ndiscover\nThe greenhouse effect\nGlobal warming, caused by the greenhouse effect, is\none of the few scientific issues which interests\npoliticians. It is also one of the most urgent and,\nun surprisingly, the BA discussed it at length.\nWe need the greenhouse effect to survive: without\nit the planet would be over 30 degrees cooler. Most\nsolar radiation can pass through the atmosphere but\nlong-wave, infra-red radiation cannot. This is because\nof the presence of the so-called 'greenhouse gases':\nwater, carbon dioxide, methane and chl or of lu oro carbons (CFCsl which act as a 'blanket' stopping the\nlong-wave radiation from the surface from escaping.\nOur current problems are caused by a recent, rapid\nand man-made increase in the concentration of these\ngases. Large amounts of carbon dioxide have been\nreleased through mass deforestation and the burning\nof fossil fuels; methane, due partially to more intensive\nfarming, has doubled in concentration over the past\ncentury and the quantity of highly potent CFCs has\nincreased dramatically over the last decade.\nThe mean temperature at the surface of the Earth\nhas already been artificially raised by half a degree.\nThe BA was told that the latest computer models\npredict that, even after recent international anti-pollution agreements, this increase will reach 1.5\ndegrees by 2030 and could be as high as 3 degrees\nby 2060.\nThe models differ in detail, but all agree that the\naverage temperature rise at the poles will be greater\nthan at the equator. They also agree that there will\nbe greater evaporation from the oceans. What is less\ncertain is what this will do to rainfall. It is believed that\nthe higher latitudes will become wetter in winter and\ndrier in summer. Dry sub-tropical areas will become\nstill drier.\nAs the temperature increases, the polar ice caps will\nstart to melt and, more significantly, the warmer\noceans will expand. This will cause the sea-level to\nrise. The best current estimates are of a sea-level\n20cm higher than today's by 2030 and 35cm higher\nby 2060.\nAll these figures assume that the models have\nincluded all possible effects. Not all researchers agree\nthat they have. One of the missing factors, according\nto Dr John Woods of the Natural Environment\nResearch Council, is the recently discovered 'plankton\nmultiplier' which could lead to still more rapid warming\nin the future.\nPlankton, microscopic plants, in the seas and\noceans absorb vast quantities of carbon dioxide as\nthey grow. Present models assume that half the\ncarbon dioxide released into the atmosphere will be\nabsorbed in this way. Dr Woods believes that the\nplankton multiplier may mean that this is a dangerous\noverestimate.\nFor most of the year, ocean turbulence washes the\nplankton up and down through hundred's of feet.\nMasses of the tiny plants spend most of their time in\nout of the reach of sunlight, unable to grow. It is only\nin spring, when the oceans are at their most calm, that\nthe plankton hover close enough to the surface to\nPage 8\nabsorb sufficient carbon dioxide.\nIt is believed that as the oceans warm, they will\nbecome more turbulent. The period of comparative\ncalm will become shorter and less gas will be\nabsorbed. A greater fraction of the carbon dioxide\nreleased will remain in the atmosphere contributing\nto global warming.\nThere is evidence that the plankton multiplier effect\nis responsible for the 7 degree temperature which\nended the last ice age.\nDr Woods hopes that new computer models of the\nworld's ocean system and the work from the research\nship Discovery will lead to a better understanding of\nthis potentially disastrous phenomenon.\nGlobal warming may cut the amount of energy\navailable from wind power, according to Dr Trevor\nDavis of the University of East Anglia's School of\nEnvironmental Sciences. According to recent\nresearch, the warming planet has left Britain less\nwindy than half a century ago.\nThis is because the poles have warmed faster than\nthe equator. The difference in atmospheric pressure\nacross the planet is now smaller and, as this difference\nis related to the amount of energy carried by the wind,\nthe wind speed has fallen.\nThe British Wind Energy Association has estimated\nthat wind energy could eventually provide up to 20%\nof our energy needs. However the slowing winds will\naffect the power output of the proposed wind\nturbines. Dr Davis has calculated that in some places,\nthe turbines will be producing 30% less power at the\nend of their lives than at the beginning. By using more\nfossil fuels now, mankind could easily be depriving\nitself at least partially of a future source of power.\nAnother speaker, Dr David Shannon, the chief\nscientist at the Ministry of Agriculture, examined the\neffect of a changed climate on farming. Britain, he told\nthe association, might become a food exporter,\ngrowing food for nations more badly affected than\nitself.\nHe predicted higher production with changes in the\ncrops being grown to take advantage of warmer,\nwetter winters. However, if the planet continues to\nwarm, conditions could rapidly become much worse.\nCattle, according to Professor Phil Grime of the\nNatural Environment Research Council, will no longer\nneed to be housed in the winter but would find it\nharder to find food in a hotter, drier summer. He\npredicted that irrigation schemes would become as\nmuch a part of UK farming as they are now in more\narid regions. Weeds and pests would flourish under\nthe changed conditions.\nOur knowledge of our climate is still incomplete.\nThere are few who would disagree that more research\nis needed. However scientists and even politicians\nnow understand that our planet and its environment\nhave limits and we are rapidly approaching them.\n\n"

    "content": "British Association The annual meeting of the British Association for\nthe Advancement of Science (BAAS), or BA89 in\nadvertisers hype-speak, was held in Sheffield in\nmid September. Every year, Imperial College\narranges for six paid-for trips to this somewhat\nexpensive event, one of which happened to fall my\nway.\nOn this and the next three pages you will find\nmy somewhat potted account of the week-long\nconference. Potted is probably too weak a word,\na lot happened and I succeeded in missing the\nvast majority of it. What you find here is a collection of the items which interested me,\nwhich I could understand and which I got round\nto writing up. The result is a someone emaciated\ncollection.\nSheffield has a topology all of its own. It is\napparently built at the junction of half a dozen hills\nand seems to consist of a number of completely\nseparate town lets with- no apparent joins in\nbetween. The town boasts a University and a Polytechnic spread over about three miles and\nseveral sites and, no doubt to stop an\ninter academic war, the organisers spread the\nevents fairly evenly between the two.\nIndividual sections, such as Physics,\nChemistry, Medicine et al, each had there own\nhome on one of the campuses. This was fine if\nyou fancied spending a whole week immersed up\nto your intellectual eyeballs in your own subject.\nHowever, for those of us with wider interests\nthings were more difficult.\nTravelling between two interesting talks at two\nwidely spaced sites was a challenge. There was\nan alleged half hourly bus service shuttling\nbetween Poly, University and various residences\nwhich was adequate unless you found yourself on\nthe wrong side of town an hour before a lecture.\n'Don't ask me, I'm from Barnsley' explained one\nharassed driver.\nThe lectures were generally good and, unlike\nhere, the audiences, mostly of school teachers,\nschool children, random academics and keen\nOAPs, was interested and attentive. Subjects\nvaried from the accessible through the obscure\nto incomprehensible Psychology seminars and\nmuch attention was paid to Science and the\nMedia.\nThese media meetings ran like a scientific\njournalism who's who as Heather Couper agreed\nwith what Nigel Henbest had said about Tom\nWilkie's opinion of Colin Blakemore. All involved\nagreed that scientists should be nicer to\njournalists and more journalists should try to\nunderstand science.\nNeedless to say, the press reports on the BA,\na self-proclaimed scientific media event, were\nhidden on inside pages of the quality papers well\nbehind the report on the SLD congress.\nSCIENCE 89\nESA: towards 2000\nThe Solar System has been explored,' says Professor\nRoger Bonnet, Director of Science for the European\nSpace Agency ESA, 'Now it needs to be studied.'\nA detailed study of the Solar System is the aim of\nESA's long-term 'Horizon 2000' programme which\nProfessor Bonnet outlined at a meeting of the Physics\nsection of the British Association. The programme\nincludes plans for missions to Saturn, to study the Sun\nand even an ambitious project to land on the nucleus\nof a comet.\nThe Solar Terrestrial Science Project (STSP) is one\nof Horizon 2000's major 'cornerstone' projects. It will\ninvestigate how conditions on the Sun influence the\nenvironment of Earth and consists of two linked\nwill be carried on the American Cassini mission to\nSaturn. While Cassini concentrates on the planet and\nits famous system of rings, Huygens will attempt to\ngently land on the moon Titan. This unique body is\nbelieved to have a chemical composition and\natmosphere like that of the early Earth. Huygens will\nbe able to photograph its surface and examine its\nstrut ure possibly giving us a glimpse of the early life\nof our own planet. Cassini and Huygens are scheduled\nto set out in 1996 or 1997.\nOne of the most successful space missions of\nrecent years was the Giotto probe to Comet Halley.\nThe spacecraft, though badly battered, survived the\nencounter and plans are now being made to send it\nJason Lander\nschemes: SOHO, observing the Sun, and CLUSTER,\nstudying the Earth.\nSOHO will use the recently-developed technique of\n'he lio seismology'. It consists of a single satellite\ncapable of detecting shock waves at the surface of\nthe Sun and in its atmosphere. The behaviour of these\ndisturbances can reveal much about conditions inside\nand uncover hidden activity.\nThe CLUSTER scheme is not a single satellite but,\nliterally, a small cluster orbiting close together within\nthe Earth's magnetic field. The satellites are designed\nto detect small changes in the strength and direction\nof the field and by comparing the data from all the\nindividual craft it will be possible to find out how such\ndisturbances travel through space. The two schemes\nare scheduled for a launch in 1995.\nStudying the Sun is also the aim of the Ulysses\nproject. This is a joint US-European venture to\nexamined the Sun's North and South poles. Earth, like\nall the major planets bar Pluto, orbits around the solar\nequator. We have not, as yet, seen the Sun and the\nSolar System from 'above' or 'below' the plane of the\nplanets. By using the gravitational field of the massive\nplanet Jupiter, the Ulysses project aims to throw a satellite into an orbit passing directly over the Solar\npoles.\nThe Ulysses satellite will measure the strength of\nthe 'solar-wind', a stream of high speed material\nthrown out from the sun into space, and the density\nof interstellar gas. It is due to be launched from the\nSpace Shuttle in October 1990 to reach its final orbit\nby 1995.\nIn addition to the Solar missions, ESA plans to visit\nthe Planet Saturn. Huygens, a european space probe,\nChris Edwards\non to another target, the more obscure Comet\nGrigg-Skjellerup.\nAll being well, Giotto should be reactivated early\nnext year and should reach its final destination by\n1992.\nA more ambitious cometary mission is Rosetta. This\nis another joint US-European effort, this time to collect\nand return to Earth samples from a comet's nucleus.\nTo do this a probe must be landed on and anchored\nto the nucleus itself. Any material collected must be\nplaced in a sealed container for transport back to\nEarth. Comets are believed to be remnants from the\nearly years of the Solar System and the mission may\nprovide much information about its creation. Rosetta\nis one of Horizon 2000's final cornerstones and, as\nyet, is not fully approved.\nProfessor Bonnet and his ESA colleagues believe\nthat no single organisation can afford to do pure space\nscience on its own. The future lies in joint projects:\nthere are plans for european contributions to future\nsuperpower visits to Mars and, perhaps more\nexotically, a joint European-American-Soviet mission\nto the Sun known as Vulcan. The Vulcan probe will\nbe designed to 'graze' the surface of the Sun at a distance of just four solar radii. There it will be able\nto make the first direct measurements of the\ncomposition of the solar atmosphere. If it goes ahead,\nVulcan could be launched by 2004.\nAll these large projects need massive funding from\nall concerned and although ESA may have plenty of\nideas, multinational collaboration is always vulnerable\nto the whim of politicians and the political 'realities'\nof under funding, Glasnost, Perestroika and US budget\ndeficits.\n! 7\n\n"
