    "content": "FELIX\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 november 2011\nWhen German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle accused recipients of welfare of living in\n\u2018late roman decadence\u2019 and expecting to gain\n\u2018effortless prosperity\u2019 in February, it caused\nquite a stir in the German media.\nWesterwelle, then head of the German Free\nDemocrat Party (FDP), faced criticism from\npoliticians all across the political spectrum. The\npopularity of the man who had won his party\na record breaking 15% of votes in the previous general election went into a rapid decline.\nUltimately, Westerwelle\u2019s attack on the German welfare state cost him the leadership of his\nparty when he was replaced by Philipp Roesler\nin May.\nTraditionally, the FDP has always been the\nstrongest proponent of the free market in the\nGerman political spectrum and Westerwelle,\nan experienced opposition leader of his party,\nhas always enjoyed provoking his political opponents with controversial statements. With the\npopularity of his party constantly falling ever\nsince it formed a coalition government with\nAngela Merkel\u2019s CDU, Westerwelle\u2019s comments could just be dismissed as a desperate\nattempt to regain popularity with his (mainly\nupper-class) voters.\nHowever, while Westerwelle is one of the\nfew politicians in Europe to express his opinions on state-sponsored welfare programs in\nsuch a radical manner, he is not alone with his\nideas. Hidden behind his statements is the be-lief, shared by many radical free market pro-ponents, that ultimately, poor people deserve to\nbe poor.\nThe intellectual foundation of the free market ideology can be derived from an economic\nprinciple called the \u2018efficient-market hypothesis\u2019. Named the \u2018Chicago school of thought\u2019\nafter the University of its origin in the 1960\u2019s it\nasserts that stocks are always priced right and\nthat markets behave fundamentally rational.\nTraditionally, the efficient-market hypothesis\nexists in a number of different strengths, with\nproponents of the strongest formulation believing that any government intervention is fundamentally harmful to the economy and that the\nfree, unregulated market is perfect in creating\nwealth.\nIn this strong formulation, everything from\nstock prizes to the worth of labor is priced\nperfectly and neither recessions nor unemployment exist. If you are unemployed, then, according to radical free market proponents, it is\nbecause you choose to be unemployed. Since\nthe economy is a perfect interplay between\nDimitri Raphaelovich\nsupply and demand, you being poor means that\nyou are less willing and less able than someone\nearning more money than you. Therefore, you\ndeserve to earn less.\nFrom this ideological point of view, Westerwelle\u2019s attack on the German welfare state only\nseems rational. Why should the majority of the\ncountry provide for a minority that is seemingly\nless willing to work than the majority? In a free\nmarket society, where everyone has the same\nopportunities of becoming rich, why should\nthose who made use of their opportunities pay\nfor those who did not?\nTo see the flaws in this line of thought, one\nhas to look at a few statistics. In general, income\nis correlated to the level of education a person\nhas. In the UK, 20% of people from the poorest\nbackgrounds go to university, compared to 57%\nfrom the richest. However, at Oxford, 89% of\nstudents are from an upper or middle class\nbackground. For people like David Cameron,\nan Oxbridge education is a birthright.\nIn Germany in 2009, the chances of you going to university were 73% if your parents had\na university degree themselves and 23% if they\nwere from the working class. Furthermore,\nonly 0.5% of leading positions in major German companies are held by people coming\nfrom a working class background. Even working class children beating the odds stacked\nagainst them to be awarded a PhD earn significantly less on average than equally qualified\npeople from richer backgrounds.\nThe evidence suggests then, that in a modern\ncapitalist society, the class system is still very\nmuch in existence. It also suggests that the notion that the amount of money people earn is\ncorrelated to their abilities and their willingness\nto work hard is fundamentally flawed. On aver-age, a person in Germany with earnings in the\nhighest income tax class is rich because he or\nshe was born into the right social class. In this\nlight, the self-righteousness with which some\nfree market proponents promote their ideology\nof a perfect market seems somewhat ill-placed.\nIt seems to be the case that, contrary to the\npremise of proponents of the free market, hard\nwork and determination are not likely to be rewarded in a capitalist system if you come from\na poor background. Thus, government intervention is needed to reduce social injustice and\nchange the odds of succeeding in life for children from poorer backgrounds.\nAdmittedly, the welfare state brings its own\nnumber of problems into the equation. There\nis a legitimate debate about how much benefits\ncan be given to the unemployed without taking away the incentive to work. However, the\nnext time people like Westerwelle launch an attack on the welfare state, one can but hope they\npause for a second and ask themselves how\nmuch of their current social standing is due to\ntheir own achievements and how much is due\nto them being lucky enough to be born into the\nright family.\nLetter from an Editor\nDear Comrades,\nSince none of you are going to read this letter, I\nhave taken the liberty of writing the following list,\nthat enshrines those words that, for some reason\nor another, I find especially amusing or interesting\nand therefore call, with your permission, my favourite English words:\nPreposterous, absurd, ridiculous \u2013 that\u2019s a nice\nlexical loop; antediluvian, rethoric, hoary and im-memorial; behemoth, apocalypsis, leviathan; irrev-erent, acatalectic, discourse; perfidious, villain,\npussillanimity; dialectic, peripatetic, obnoxious;\nghastly, gargantuan; lethargy, sardonic, libertari-an; spectre, abyss, culpability; lugubrious, doleful,\nfunereal \u2013 that\u2019s another lexical loop, and I shall\nwrite something more here as I have just realised\nI may have problems to fill the whole column with\nwords without repeating one or two or leaving a\nblank space at the bottom; for my good taste can\nbe eclipsed by my bad memory.\nGalore, abundance, fellowship, girdle; abate-ment, abbe, cessation; impede, thwart, delve,\ndwell; forestall, oblivion, obviate, abet, specula-tive; flee, forestay, mainmast, yawl, abaft; nauti-cal, shaft, aft, astern; bashful, disinclined, timid;\ntranquility, intricate, labyrinth; dominion, suprema-cy, sway; utter, distinct, vacuum; hearken, herald,\nnemesis; requital, papism, romance; amendment,\ncharter, odd; extravagant, eccentric, heliocen-tric, anthropocentric, lattice; gathering, reactor,\nsubstance; ingrain, yeoman, seafare; landlubber,\ntimorous, whim, herein, hereafter, wherein, where-upon; rustling, rust, rotten; hearsay, clamor, tu-mult, mob.\nAnd that completes the list!

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n10\nIn brief\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 NOVEMBER 2011\nO\nn the 14th of September of\nthis year, at the British Science Festival in the University\nof Bradford, was presented\nthe seemingly awkward project called SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering) led by UK\nscientists. The basic idea is to suspend a huge\nballoon one kilometre up in the stratosphere\nwhich would then pump out tap water out to\nproduce artificial rain. This would lead to\nan abatement of CO2 concentration in the\natmosphere and reduce the effects of global\nwarming.\nThe project is an example of research by\nthe developing discipline called \u2018geo-engineering\u2019 or \u2018climate engineering\u2019, in which\ntechnologies, such as \u2018cloud seeding\u2019 or solar\nradiation management (SRM) would be used\nto counteract the effect of global warming on\nthe planet.\nDr Matt Watson from the University of\nBristol, leading the SPICE project said: \u201cThis\nis a controversial and potentially alarming\nsubject\u201d. The word \u201calarming\u201d implicitly\nrefers to public perception, but this time it\nseems that not all of the scientists\u2019 usual assumptions are \u2018elementary, my dear Watson\u2019.\nAn international survey conducted in November and December 2010 by the University of Calgary, Simon Fraser University\n(Canada) and Harvard University (US) found\nthat the public\u2019s understanding of the field of\nclimate engineering is unexpectedly high and\nthat there is significant support from the public to explore the potential of SRM technologies in grappling with global warming. The\ninternet-based survey involved about 3,000\npeople from different cultural and economical background in Canada, US and UK. The\nresults were published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.\nPeople answered 18 questions grouped into\nfive sections which, respectively, aimed to\nassess their knowledge of: \u201cgeo-engineering\u201d\nor \u201cclimate engineering\u201d terms, the indices\nof global warming belief and technological\noptimism, the technical information about\nSRM, the perception about its potential use\nto reduce global warming and to understand\nthe geographical provenience and cultural\nbackground of the participants. The questionnaire was first performed without allowing\nthe public to obtain any information about\ngeo-engineering, and was repeated a second\ntime after providing as neutral as possible\ntechnical information about the subject.\nInterestingly, the survey revealed that\nwhile there is general confusion about the\nterm \u2018geo-engineering\u2019 (only 8% of participants could correctly defined it, the others\noften mistakenly associating it to geotechnical and environmental engineering) the public understanding of \u2018climate engineering\u2019 is\ngenerally much higher (45%).\nRegarding the controversy about the potential use of SRM technologies in combating\nglobal warming, two distinct groups, supporters (about 29%) and detractors (20%),\nappeared together with a considerable number of the uncertain participants (25%).\nThe supporters strongly believed that\nglobal warming is an ongoing serious issue\nand trust the scientists studying and applying\nDo the public trust scientists?\nAntonio Torrisi reports on a study of attitudes towards geoengineering\nIdentification of the genetic control mechanism\nby which plants detect low oxygen levels could\nlead to the production of flood tolerant crops.\nA team at Nottingham University have discovered the genetic pathway governing how plants\nrespond to waterlogging. This pathway controls\nkey proteins which become more stable as oxygen levels drop. Michael Holdsworth, Professor\nof Crop Science explains: \u201ctheir stability results\nin changes in gene expression and metabolism\nthat enhance survival in low oxygen conditions\u201d.\nIt is hoped that genetic engineering can be used\nto manipulate this pathway, improving plants ability to cope with waterlogging.\nWith climate change predicting an increase in\nthe frequency of flooding, genetic engineering is\nlikely to become a key player in ensuring global\nfood security.\nLucy van Dorp\nSRM techniques to tackle the problem. After\na more detailed explanation of the potential\nrisks of SRM techniques, such as slow recovery of ozone layer, the number of supporters\nin favor of its immediate use decreased, but\nthey still supported the study of the technology for future applications. On the contrary,\ndetractors were much more skeptical that\nglobal warming was an issue and believed\nthat humans should not manipulate nature in\nthis way.\nWhile the percentage of supporters were\nequally distributed among the three coun-tries, detractors appear to be more present in\nUS. Ideological and political views do not\nseem to determine into which group a participant falls. Environmentalists and political conservatives were equally distributed in\ntwo groups.\nIt is noteworthy that all participants said\nwe should rely more on future information\nabout benefits and risks coming from scientists at research centers and academics,\nrather than from federal governments.\n\u201cI think this is the first in line of many\nstudies that will show that SRM intersects\nwith people\u2019s political and environmental attitudes in surprising ways\u201d says Ashley Mercer, lead author of the study.\nThe perception of risk will likely play a\ncentral role in the debate about the use of\nSRM to reduce global warming, but this survey shows that the public are aware of what\nscientists are doing and support them more\nthan the scientists might expect.\nDOI:10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/044006\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nCloudy skies could become an even more common sight if geoengineering technique cloud seeding becomes widespread\nFollow the latest science news\nfrom Imperial and more on our\nFacebook page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\nLike us on Facebook\nConfused by DOIs?\nDOI stands for digitial object identifier.

With blue skies and\na light breeze in Greenford the boys in\nblue new they were in for something\ngood.\nDespite Oxford not getting a team, there\nwas a good showing from St Mary\u2019s,\nCambridge and Lakenheath , who\nare made up of US Air Force pilots (I\nknow!).\nIt was decided that St Mary\u2019s and\nourselves should play as a joint team,\nwhich is what we are doing for Championships, against a mixed team of Cambridge and Lakenheath in a 60 minute,\n13-aside match.\nThe match began with a shaky start for\nboth sides as the players got to know the\nteammates in their joint team. Once the\nball got rolling it became clear that the\nLondon side were the dominant force.\nWith some spectacular defending by\nNeil Clancy and Paul McGovern, Cambridge found it hard to get near the AllStar Hurler Stevie Gallagher, who was\nstuck in goals through injury but managed some great saves. When the ball\ndid go wide Stevie\u2019s poc-outs where\nliterally hit or miss, due to \u201cthe wind\u201d.\nIn mid-field Jack McCaughan and Keith\nmade impressive runs and scored some\npoints from distance. Despite not being\nable to run at all, St. Mary\u2019s fresher and\nU-21 Tyrone footballer Ryan poached\nlike a pro and kicked as many points\nand goals as he pucked. He racked up\nan impressive score line.\nCambridge showed some promise at\nthe start of the second half with two\ngoals and a point, but London got back\nin gear and started to dominate again.\nThey were boosted by the presence of\nDonal McCann, St Mary\u2019s Captain; put\na few great shots over the bar. With the\nLondon forwards seeing the majority\nof the ball Jerome Scullion, clearly a\nbit rusty after his 5 years in Borstal for\nstealing dusties, and John McGuckin\ncreated a few penalties and 65\u2019s, which\nwere converted.\nSean Dunne in centre half forward\nmade some good catches, but showed\nhe was a footballer when it came to\nhitting the ball. His frustration was unleashed on an unsuspecting American\nwhen he was fouled. London continued\nto dominate until the final whistle.\nWith a few pints in the bar, Imperial\nand the Mary\u2019s lads agreed that the test\ndrive of the amalgamated team had been\nsuccessful, looking forward to next Saturday when we hope to bring it to the\nNorthern and Scottish Universities who\ndon\u2019t know what\u2019s coming!\nContact gaelic.sports@imperial.ac.uk\nfor any information on the team.\nFELIX\nSPORT\nFriday 04 november 2011\nIC Hurlers off to strong start\nImperial & St Mary\u2019s 8-14\nCambridge 3-4\nWe\u2019re not sure what the giant mound of earth is for, either\nIndy Leclercq\nSports Editor\nThis is it, then.

I don\u2019t\nknow about the rest of the Felix\nteam, but I hope you have as much\nfun reading this one as us editors\ndown here have had doing it.\nI also hope you enjoyed the back\ncover, which was the fruit of quite a\nbit of trawling through the archives,\nlooking for nuggets of sport through\nall the years Felix has been active.\nIt turns out that the place of sport\nin this newspaper has ebbed and\nflowed over the years, with some\neditors giving it plenty of space, nice\ngraphics and decent pictures. Other\ntimes, it\u2019s hastily collated in at the\nbottom of a page, with about three\nresults and 50-word reports. For the\nfirst fifteen or so years of existence,\nFelix even had a late news supple-ment, which was basically a couple\nof typewritten pages sent out on\nfriday afternoon - it\u2019s a shame that\ndoesn\u2019t exist any more, it would be a\ngodsend for getting results in.\nSince the beginning, though,\nwe\u2019ve not been renowed as a sporting uni (although that is starting to\nchange), and browsing the archives\nmakes you realise how little has\nchanged through the years: Imperial\nstudents are unmistakebly Imperial\nstudents, whether its 1959 or 2009\n(as you can see in this week\u2019s Hangman, we still have the same sense\nof humour. The sportspeople tend\nto remain the same, too. There are\nalways the Rugby and Hockey lot, up\nfor a laugh; Rowing, who have been\ngetting up at obscene hours to train\nsince time immemorial and then\nsuccesses in minor sports (Badmin-ton, Basketball, Fencing and - yes -Tiddlywinks).\nActually that sport headline from\nthe 70s struck me when I saw it\n(and is now on the back page). I\u2019m\nnot sure if the editor of the day was\ntaking the piss, or if he really regarded Tiddlywinks as something that\nenough Imperialites were interested\nin to print the report. In the pre-WOW and Starcraft days, I guess it\nmust have been. What would people\nhave done to occupy the studying\nspaces otherwise? You can network\na few library tables and have a massively multiplayer Tiddlywinks game,\nI suppose.\nUnfunny attempts at humour\naside, though, there has alwways\nbeen a tradition of sport at our beloved university (-sorry, I\u2019ll stop now)\nand Felix has always been there to\nreport on our glowing triumphs and\nsoul-crushing defeats. Thanks to\nall of you who send your reports in,\nthe section is really hitting its stride\nnow.\nOn another note, I hope to have\nthe Captains interviews running on\na more regular basis from now on,\nso if you\u2019re in a club and interested\nin getting your Captain or President\nin these pages, drop me an email!\nComing soon: Rugby, Rowing and\nSynchronised Swimming.

This country was\nat its greatest at the end of the 19th Century\nunder good old Queen Victoria. During the\nindustrial revolution the economy grew by\nleaps and bounds, and the Empire was at full\nstrength. This was a time when you had what\nyou could afford, when what you could afford depended on your job, and your job depended on who your father was \u2013 what a wonderful system! Those of us who could afford\nthe luxuries in life would be guaranteed a\nstandard of life for generations to come, and\nthose who couldn\u2019t, worked in factories or as\nservants. There would have been no riots this\nsummer if such an employment system still\nexisted, where you had to toil to reap the rewards of life...\nJust imagine the possibilities if we could\nscrap the welfare state. Think what we could\ndo with that \u00a3111bn. We could offer tax\nbreaks to the rich, the people who so valiantly shoulder such a large chunk of the tax\nburden; we could reduce inheritance tax, so\nthose of us who have family estates do not\nhave to bare such excessive financial costs\nwhen passing our fortunes from one generation to the next.\nSo why should everyone deserve the same\nstandards of life, and why should everyone\nbe able to afford the same things? Surely the\nfairest economy and society is one where you\nare rewarded for working hard, having rich\nparents, and punished for not pulling your\nweight? We shouldn\u2019t become a nation where\nwe depend on hand-outs from the state; we\nshould be encouraging people to work hard\nto strengthen the economy! And if they do\nnot want to, they should lose their \u201chuman\nrights\u201d to televisions, and be forced to work\nin a Victorian-esque manner like this woman\non the left.

This is a lie! The welfare state is so\nprofoundly unfair it is ridiculous! Those who\nwork hard to earn a living have to sacrifice a\nlarge proportion of their pay to tax to \u201cbenefit society\u201d. However there are some people\nwho do not want to work, cannot be bothered to work, some even who can\u2019t work(!),\nand still get some free money every week off\nthe state \u2013 how on God\u2019s green earth is that\nfair?!\nPeople in this country have become far\ntoo dependent on the state. Forecasted government spending in 2012 is \u00a3703bn, with\n\u00a3111bn on welfare and \u00a3124bn on healthcare.\nThat works out at about \u00a33,500 per person,\nand that\u2019s what each of us should receive in a\nfair and equal system. Unbelievably, not everyone gets access to that though. The man\nwho works hard every day to pay his way in\nlife won\u2019t see a penny, but the man who sits\non his sofa all day long watching daytime\nTV will get some few pennies more than his\nfair share.\nHave we become a society of entitlement?\nIt seems we have begun to believe we should\nall have access to the same things, the same\nquality of life, no matter what we do to benefit society and our country. In the past, the\nreward for working hard was being able to\nhave the luxuries in life \u2013 owning your own\nhouse, your own car, going on holiday and\nbuying the latest technologies. But now it\nseems it has almost become a human right\nto have these things. In the past, any spare\nmoney that didn\u2019t need spending on the bare\nnecessities would be saved, so when something out of the ordinary was required or\nwhen times were tough, you would be able\nto make ends meet. Those who sit around\non benefits don\u2019t have to save, don\u2019t have to\nthink about the future; benefits become pure\ndisposable income. It\u2019s no wonder that some\nMr Poppadom\nA land of opportunity, \u201cwhere people can think and act\nand worship any way they want\u201d\nFight for Freedom!\n20\nThere is no fair in Welfare\nIndeed, the world would be a happier place with no welfare whatsoever: a jungle in\nwhich those who deserve it would rule. Punk-rockers against the Welfare State\nLetter from an Editor\nIn a brilliant piece of journalism, this summer, BBC\neconomics editor and Newsnight correspondent\nPaul Mason traveled from Oklahoma to California,\nretracing the footsteps of the fictional Joad family\nin Steinbeck\u2019s epic The Grapes of Wrath. The state\nof the US economy may not have hit the lows of\nthe Great Depression, but in this modern-day journey there were enough parallels to Steinbeck\u2019s\nstory of the plight of migrant workers to prompt\nserious concerns over where the country\u2019s economy is heading.\nAs well as being a cornerstone of American Literature Steinbeck\u2019s novel is a go-to text during\ntimes of economic recession. After the economic\nboom of the 1980s came \u2018Black Monday\u2019, October\n1987. The Dow Jones Industreal Average plummeted by 22.6% and, while the stock market recovered quickly, the crash triggered a savings and\nloans crisis in the US that was to last in to the next\ndecade. Commentators turned to Grapes, and in\nan astonishing piece of comedy and social narra-tion, Fox broadcast a Simpsons episode titled The\nCrepes of Wrath.\nThe story follows Bart, who, after a pulling a\nprank in school, is signed on to a cultural exchange\nprogram as a punishment. He is sent to France, to\nthe dilapidated \u201cCh\u00e2teau Maison\u201d, where under\nthe watchful eyes of two crooks he is forced to\ntake over the back-breaking duties of Maurice the\ndonkey. At the same time an exchange student\nfrom Albania arrives in the Simpsons household.\nAdil is the perfect houseguest, engaging in conversation with Lisa over politics, praising Homer, and\noffering Marge help with the dishes \u2013 \u201cMrs. Simpson, you have been oppressed enough today\u201d.\nIn drawing current parallels with Grapes and the\nGreat Depression Paul Mason framed the seriousness of the problems faced by western economies.\nThe Occupy movement that has been sweeping\nthrough the financial centres of the western world\npresents itself as a yet another symptom of ailments in our culture. Following the suggestion of\nMatt Groening et al. we may now look for a cultural\nexchange.\nThe question over the state of capitalism is being\nvisited with increasing frequency in op-eds. Now,\nin this 1500th issue of Felix, and in the mischie-vous, propagandist, spirit of the 5th of November,\nwe don our Anonymous masks, and present you\nthe largest dichotomy of opinions on capitalism\nwe could think of. Drawing on quotations lifted directly from Crepes we present discussions on both\nOccupy, and a subject that never fails to inspire\nheated debate \u2013 that of the welfare state. Enjoy.\n\u2013 A Business Editor\nBUSINE$$\n\n"

At the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, Jonathan Wyatt, 63,\nfrom Bristol became the first person to\nreceive gene therapy for blindness.\nHe and the other 11 patients who were\ninvolved in the clinical trial, were all\nsufferers of Choroideremia, a type of\ndisease, which causes progressive loss\nof vision and eventually blindness. It\nis a rare inherited disease caused by a\ndeficiency of the REP-1 gene on the X\nchromosome, making it more common\nin men than women. Estimates suggest\n100,000 people worldwide are affected\nwith this disease.\nPeople who are diagnosed with Choroideremia usually suffer from loss of\nvision, acuity, colour and depth percep-tion, as well as severe night blindness as\nthe disease progresses throughout their\nlife. The first symptom is usually night\nblindness noticed during childhood. As\ntime goes by, the sufferer\u2019s retina falls\napart and eventually blindness takes\nover. The clinical trial could restore\nhope in all Choroideremia sufferers.\nThe gene therapy was designed to restore the missing gene on the X chromosome to stop the retina from deteriorat-ing. The treatment comes in the form\nof a virus that carries the DNA with\nthe missing gene. It is injected into the\neye of the patient and is engineered to\ntarget the photoreceptor in the retina.\nAt this site, the gene will be delivered,\nswitched on and activated. It is thought\nthat the gene can reside in the retinal\nFarhan Abdullah\nGene therapy could be cure for blindness\nMalaria vaccine enters phase III trials\nA malaria vaccine candidate called\nRTS,S has been raising a stir within the\nhealth industry since the pharmaceutical\ngiant, Glaxo-Smith Kline, announced\nhighly promising results in its on-going\nphase III trials in Africa. Whilst it is unwise to declare success too soon, it is\nhoped that these early results may mark\nthe beginning of the greatest breakthrough in malarial control yet.\nMalaria represents one of the world\u2019s\nmost pressing public health problems,\nkilling nearly 800,000 people every\nyear, mostly children in Africa, and\ndevelopment of a vaccine is an urgent\nneed. After decades of failed vaccine at-tempts, it is seeming increasingly likely\nthat RTS,S will become our first approved vaccine against this debilitating,\nparasitic disease.\nThe first results from the on-going tri-al, in which over 15,000 children are en-rolled, show that RTS,S reduces the risk\nof malaria by half in children aged five\nto seventeen months. Crucially, the vaccine showed no significant side-effects\nand can be administered safely along\nwith other childhood vaccines. However, information regarding the longer-term protective effects of the vaccine\nwill not be available until the end of\n2014, 30 months after the children have\nreceived their third dose of the vaccine.\nA vaccine is an essential tool in reducing the burden of malaria since the\ncausative agent, a protozoan parasite\ncalled Falciparum, regularly develops\nresistance to drugs, making some cases\nuntreatable. Antimalarial drugs are also\nvery expensive and often unavailable\nin many developing African countries.\nMosquitoes similarly develop resistance\nto insecticides, decreasing the efficacy of\nbednets and indoor spraying. Throughout\nhistory, vaccines have also proven to be\nhighly cost-effective and powerful ways\nof preventing morbidity and mortality\nfrom disease, allowing for the eradication\nof smallpox and very near-eradication of\npoliomyelitis. It is likely that even a modestly efficacious malaria vaccine would\nprevent hundreds of thousands of cases of\nthe disease every year.\nContrary to many vaccines such as\nthose for the polio and influenza virus-es, which were relatively simple to develop and available many decades ago,\nthe development of a malaria vaccine\nhas been a long and tortuous process.\nThe most significant challenge that\nscientists face is a lack of understanding of the immune responses associated with protection against the disease.\nSince the function of a vaccine is to\nelicit a long-lasting, protective immune\nresponse against a specific pathogen, it\ndoes not help in this case that scientists\ndo not know what type of response they\nshould be aiming for.\nRTS,S is designed to trigger the immune system to defend against Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria,\nwhen it first enters the human host\u2019s\nbloodstream (after a mosquito bite) and\nwhen the parasite infects liver cells. It\naims to prevent the parasite from infect-ing, maturing and multiplying in the liv-er, as well as from re-entering the bloodstream and infecting red blood cells, at\nwhich point the affected person, nor-mally, would begin to show symptoms.\nFor now, the scientific community\nis waiting on edge for these late-stage\nsafety and efficacy trials to be complet-ed, but the World Health Organisation\nhas indicated that a policy recommendation for the RTS,S vaccine is possible as\nearly as 2015. However, there are concerns about the affordability of the vaccine and some health experts point out\nthat RTS,S is not as effective as other\ncommon vaccines. Nevertheless, there\nare many reasons to be optimistic about\nthe advent of such an important weapon\nto fight malaria and hopeful that this\ndisease may be eradicated in the not so\ndistant future.\nSophia David\nI\u2019m afraid there were no cute pictures of mosquitoes...\ncells indefinitely once it has been deliv-ered, hopefully making it permanent.\nProfessor Miguel Seabra of the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College, who was involved in the\ntrial, expressed his gratitude towards the\nindividuals that have had a big influence\non the development of the treatment. He\nsaid that this trial only became possible\nwhen some of the affected families and\nprivate charities raised funds for the\nresearch.\nProfessor Seabra and Dr Tanya Tolmachova of Imperial lead much of the\npreclinical work. They identified the\ngene that caused Choroideraemia and\nbuilt a mouse model to gain preclinical\ndata necessary for the trial to be carried out.\nThe 12 patients involved will undergo surgery in order for the gene to be\ndelivered through the virus. Only one\neye will be involved in the gene thera-py, as the other eye will be used as the\ncontrol to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe treatments.\nHowever, the researchers said that\nthey would repeat the treatment with\nthe second eye if it is shown to be ef-fective. It is estimated that it will take\nup to 2 years to assess the effectiveness\nof the treatment.\nIf it is proven to be successful, then\nthis will be the first-ever treatment for\nthe disease.\nA virus carrying modified DNA is injected into the patient\u2019s eye \u2013 luckily for you, we don\u2019t have a picture of that\n\n"

The raising\nof tuition fees, which also held no voter mandate, and the 80% cut in central\neducation funding has given the government an opportunity to cause drastic changes to the ethic at the heart of\nour education system. As the funding\nfor higher education will now mainly\nbe coming from student debt, not the\ndebt of the government (a simple treasury trick to reduce the deficit), the\nwhite paper uses this to turn students\ninto consumers and privatise our edu-cation.\nThe white paper mentions the fees\nincrease as being an opportunity\nto introduce competition into the\nhigher education. This competition\nis treated as a necessity as the white\npaper implies that universities are\ninefficient and therefore they need to\nbe whipped into shape by cutting their\n\u201cdependency on the government\u201d.\nDue to the cuts to the central funding\nonly fees above \u00a37,500-\u00a38,000 will\nhope to re-coup the current funding\nper student, which is why nearly every\nuniversity started requesting to charge\nthe full \u00a39,000 cap; a parliamentary\ncommittee found this would have\nsignificantly increased the cost of\nhigher education. As the whole idea\nwas to save money the white paper\nproposes an incentive to keep fees low\nfor some universities, which is done by\nstudent place allocation.\nThe government wants to set up\na core of student places, which are\nguaranteed, and then marginal places\nwhich universities compete over. As\nthe overall amount of places will stay\nthe same this opens the potential for\nuniversities to not only have different\nnumbers of students each year,\ncausing difficulties in the finance of\ninstitutions, but also to go bankrupt;\na consequence the white paper is\nparticularly relaxed about but could\nhave devastating effects on students.\nOver half the marginal places will be\ngiven to AAB students, this means\nthe elite universities will have no\nissue maintaining, or expanding, their\nnumbers to the detriment of other top\nuniversities. The rest of the marginal\nplaces are for universities charging\nless than \u00a37,500. Now universities\nwill be even more intent on getting\nmore students, with less resources\nper student, just to stay open,\nreducing the quality of the education.\nCurrently each student, at whatever\nuniversity, has the same block grant.\nHowever, with these changes, there\nwill be disparity between what can\nbe afforded at each institution. As the\nparticipation of young disadvantaged\npeople is concentrated in middle\nand lower tariff universities we will\nfurther socially segregate our society\nas the poorer are given lower quality\nuniversity education. The National\nStudent Survey showed that at the\nmoment the difference in ranking\nbetween universities is small and not\nstatistically significant; this is because\ngrants per student are the same. With\nthese changes we will rapidly increase\nthe difference in the higher education\nyou are entitled to due to your social\nbackground.\nThis reform also places the student\nin a consumer role. Universities will\nneed to attract us, otherwise they will\nnot receive enough in fees to stay\nsolvent. The white paper places a lot\nof emphasis on the salary and job that\nthe degree can provide the student\nwith, although this financial service\na degree provides should surely only\nbe secondary. The role of a university\nis to carry out research and then\nexchange and debate this knowledge\nwith students, not to prepare students\nfor the work place. Stefan Collini\nhighlights how this is worrying as\na degree should enable a student to\nlearn independently and critically\nthrough hard work and graft, but as\na consumer the student will purely\nwant to be provided with a service that\nachieves a high salary afterwards. He\nsummarises that the student should not\nbe a consumer, as we do not always\nknow what is best for us.\nFinally, the white paper does not\nonly force competition into higher\neducation which will not only open\nHow the coalition plans to change higher education\nRajat Jain\nsocial divides and devalue our\neducation but opens the way for rapid\nprivatisation of the whole sector. It\naims to reduce the regulation on the\nstatus of a \u201cuniversity\u201d to allow private\nproviders to come in and undercut\nuniversities to obtain places from the\nunder \u00a37500 marginal allocation. They\nwill provide low cost education, but\nwill do this through distance learning\nand larger class sizes to maintain\nprofits to pay boards and executive\npay (though obviously current vice-chancellors are not particularly cheap).\nFurthermore they want to allow current\npublic universities to become private\n(as Oxford are currently considering),\nwhich enables the huge wealth accrued\nthrough public money to quickly fall\ninto private hands; as we have seen\nin countless privatisations of public\nbodies the benefit is never to the\npublic but to the owners who strip the\nconsiderable assets. These reforms\ndo not put the student at the heart of\nthe system as the white paper says,\nbut instead places corporate profit\nat the heart. This is why thousands\nof students and lecturers will march\nnext Wednesday (9/11) to the city of\nLondon and walk out of lectures on\nNovember 30.\nLast week was a particularly brutal\none for David Cameron and his policy\non Europe. First the French president\nNicholas Sarkozy told him to \u201cshut\nup\u201d over unhelpful criticisms over the\nEuro. To make matters worse, on his\nreturn, Mr Cameron faced an 81 member backbench rebellion over a proposed referendum on whether Britain\nshould remain in the EU, withdraw, or\ntake certain powers back from Brussels. This rebellion came despite a\nthree line whip.\nBritain and France have rarely seen\neye to eye when it comes to long term\nEU strategies, and it has historically\nbeen a divisive issue within the\nConservative Party. This, however,\nplaces Dave in a far worse position\nthan he could\u2019ve imagined.\nTelling another world leader\nto shut up is a diplomatic rarity,\nparticularly between two centre-right European leaders who have\ncollaborated closely on defence deals\nto cut spending, and the invasion of\nanother country (Libya). Tensions\nare clearly rising over the Euro crisis\nand with their hopes pinned on the\nlaughable Berlusconi and dismal\nelection prospects for Sarkozy next\nyear, Cameron\u2019s \u2018told you so\u2019 attitude\nover the Euro is not winning him any\nfriends.\nUnfortunately for the Prime\nMinister, he is also losing the support\nof Eurosceptics at home. He hardly\nhad a cosy relationship with the\nbackbenchers since he took power.\nMany blame him for failing to win the\nelection outright. His first move was\na power sharing deal with the liberal-left; anathema to many grassroots\nConservatives. His second, a deal to\nincrease frontbench influence in the\nbackbenchers\u2019 1922 Committee, lost\nhim most of their trust.\nThis, however, goes beyond\nfractured political relationships-it reflects the Prime Minister\u2019s\nfailure to take any decisive policy\nin Europe. While New Labour\u2019s\npolicy largely involved taking a\ngreater role in leading Europe, the\nConservative\u2019s manifesto was about\nbringing powers back to Britain and\nreducing involvement in Europe. The\nmanifesto stated \u201cIn future, the British\npeople must have their say on any\ntransfer of powers to the European\nUnion ... any proposed future treaty\nthat transferred areas of power, or\ncompetences, would be subject to a\nreferendum.\u201d Mr Cameron, before\nbeing elected, had stated that it is\nnot right to use the whip against non-manifesto issues; MPs stood for the\nparty with the understanding that they\nsupport the manifesto, but otherwise\nare independent representatives for\ntheir constituents. Not only has Mr\nCameron broken this rule, but he\nhas instructed MPs to vote against\nsomething which, in spirit, was\nsupported by the manifesto.\nHe gives two main reasons for\nthis- the situation has changed\nbecause they are now in coalition\nwith the Liberal Democrats and the\nreferendum would be a distraction at\na time when they should be dealing\nwith the Euro Crisis. Neither of\nthese is particularly convincing.\nThe coalition agreement would not\nprevent MPs voting independently.\nAfter all, they are in service to their\nconstituency not the party. If their\nconstituents voted for them due to\ntheir Euro-sceptic platform, they owe\nit to them to support the referendum.\nThe Prime Minister may oppose the\nmotion, but using a three line whip\n(which could have them removed\nfrom the party), puts them in a very\nunfair position. The fact that they\ndid not have a majority meant it was\nunlikely to pass anyway, making the\nwhip a stupid political move, as it\nwould never be able to become a\n\u2018distraction\u2019. In any case, Cameron\u2019s\npolicy over the Euro Crisis- pointing\nfingers without making any helpful\nsuggestions- means Britain is fast\nbecoming irrelevant to the Euro Crisis\nin the eyes of many European leaders.\nThanks to the Prime Minister\u2019s\npolicy (or lack thereof), Britain is\nnow in a position where it is losing\ngreater power to Brussels while\nbecoming an increasingly peripheral\nand unimportant member of the union.\nThe Conservatives in Europe\nThe Privatisation of Universities\nLuke Sheldon\nDavid Cameron is still feeling blue about events on the continent\n\u201cBritain and\nFrance have rarely\nseen eye to eye...\u201d\n\u201cNow universities will\nbe even more intent on getting more\nstudents, with less\nresources per student...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 04 november 2011 15\nTECHNOLOGY\nThe next iteration of Android\u2019s future\nWith new, improving Android phones\nhitting the market all the time alongside\nfierce competition from Apple, this left\nus wondering what new features Google\nand Samsung had up their sleeves. Unlike Apple, they\u2019ve opted for a slight redesign for their new device. Also, keeping in line with the trends in Android\nphones, they have increased the screen\nsize to a whopping 4.65\u201d. Unfortunately, the display is only a SuperAMOLED\nscreen, instead of Super AMOLED\nplus. This essentially means that \u2013 despite what Samsung say \u2013 its colour rendition and effective pixel density are not\nas good as other phones on the market.\nFor example, Samsung\u2019s very own Galaxy S II and Apple\u2019s iPhone both have\nbetter displays.\nWhilst this may disappoint some,\nthe colour distortion is only minor, and\nsince it occurs across the whole screen\nit isn\u2019t particularly noticeable. Furthermore, as it has long been a known problem for screens of this type, it is often\ncorrected to a certain degree on the software end. Another issue however, is that\nsome people may think the screen size\nwill make the phone too big. To sidestep this, Samsung have decreased the\nbezel surrounding the screen such that\nthe increase in dimensions is not major\nwhen compared to its predecessor. Another plus is the decrease in thickness,\nand overall the phone is still quite light\nat 135 grams (only 5 grams heavier than\nthe Nexus S).\nAmong the most impressive features\nof the Galaxy Nexus is the increase in\nperformance. Featuring a 1.2GHz dual-core processor alongside 1GB of RAM,\nthis super-phone is more than capable of\nhandling anything Google have thrown\nat it with ICS. Another improvement is\na larger battery, although this may not\nlead to longer battery life due to the\nincreased power consumption of the\nlarger screen and new processor. Whilst\nthe camera may be criticised by many\nfor lacking megapixels compared to the\ncurrent market, Samsung have promised\na better sensor enabling 1080p video\nrecording, ensuring that every one of\nthose five million pixels counts.\nsmartphones and tablets. Right at the\ncore of the update is a UI overhaul. Citing the all too familiar words that user\nfriendliness is key in any phone OS,\nGoogle went on to explain their motivations behind some of the changes.\nEssentially, they\u2019ve gone for a futuristic style theme, rather than making parts\nof the UI resemble real materials, like\nwood. At the heart of this is \u2018Roboto\u2019, a\nnew font that has been designed to make\nreading much easier on a screen. Interestingly, the inspiration for this change\ncomes from the way that text appears\nin magazines. Indeed, this style is also\napparent in the layout of content, with\nmore emphasis on widgets, that are not\nonly easier to find but can now also be\nre-sized.\nAfter Apple borrowed a feature or two\nfrom Android when it comes to notifi-cations, it seems Google are returning\nthe favour, as the whole notifications\nbar can also be accessed from the lock\nscreen. This means users can unlock\nstraight to their app and dismiss notifications individually using an intuitive swipe gesture. This gesture is also\nused in the new multi-tasking interface\nthat allows users to review and dismiss\ncurrently running apps they don\u2019t need\nanymore. Further to additional control\nover applications, Google also seem to\nbe pushing for transparency with users\nnow able to view rich graphs detailing\ndata usage for each application in set-tings. This will be a welcome feature\nfor many, especially those who have a\nusage cap on their data allowance and\nare concerned about how much of their\nprecious data apps are using.\nKeeping in line with the changes\nbrought in for Honeycomb (the previous version of Android exclusively for\ntablets), Ice Cream Sandwich provides\nsupport software buttons for home,\nback, etc. that rotate with the phone\u2019s\norientation. This is well suited to many\nof the latest Android phones given their\nlarger screens, however it may be a\ndrawback on the cheaper devices with\nmuch smaller screens.\nbeen a feature in Android. Whether it\nbe to protect personal data or prevent a\nsneaky friend from messing around on\nyour phone, it\u2019s a useful feature. However there has always been a concern\nthat someone looking over your shoulder could see you type your passcode\nor draw your pattern, not to mention the\nadditional hassle it adds. Google have\nidentified a way to side-step these issues by using the front facing camera\nand facial recognition software to identify who you are. Appropriately called\nFace Unlock, this new feature is, so\nfar, exclusive to Android and certainly\na USP. Critics may question both how\neffective it is in recognising your face\nand how secure it is (i.e. whether or not\nit will unlock the phone to anyone who\nlooks similar). However, these will not\nbe concerns for any users who just want\na light level of security that allows them\nquick and easy access to their phone.\nAdam Forsyth looks in-depth at Ice Cream Sandwich and its new flagship device\nA\nfortnight ago saw Google\nteam up with Samsung\nfor the much anticipated\nlaunch of the latest iteration of Android, its\npopular smartphone OS, alongside the\nGalaxy Nexus, the latest and greatest\nGoogle branded hardware to run it on.\nHeld in Hong Kong, the keynote swiftly\nbegan with Samsung taking to the stage\nto discuss the Galaxy Nexus. It\u2019s not the\nfirst time the two companies have partnered together to release a smartphone,\nas last year they unveiled the Nexus S.\nThe hardware\nThe software\nIn the true style of any good meal, after Samsung had finished discussing\nthe hardware that was the main course,\nGoogle took to the stage for the sweet\ndessert. This was exciting stuff, as Ice\nCream Sandwich has been hotly anticipated as the release that will integrate\nthe two separate streams of the OS for\nBrand new features\nAnyone who uses their phone to take a\nlot of pictures will be impressed with\nthe improvements to the camera app in\nICS. Like in iOS 5, it can be accessed\ndirectly from the lock screen and is capable of taking photos instantaneously.\nA drawback of this is that photos can be\nunfocussed. However, that should be a\nworthy trade-off if it means capturing\nthose unmissable moments. Also new is\nthe new panorama feature, enabling rich\nwidescreen shots that will be enormously useful when on holiday, sightseeing\nthose gorgeous landscapes.\nA hardware feature that the Galaxy\nNexus shares with its predecessor is\na Near Field Communications (NFC)\nchip. However, when the Nexus S was\nreleased, there wasn\u2019t much to use it\nwith, and we haven\u2019t even got Google\nWallet \u2013 their contactless payment system \u2013 over here yet. In ICS though, is\nAndroid Beam, a feature that enables\ncontent sharing phone-to-phone using\nNFC. Whilst sharing items has long\nbeen available to phones, via Bluetooth\nor other means, Android Beam does\nmake it a lot easier, with users simply\nneeding to touch their phones. They\nwill then be offered the opportunity to\n\u2018Beam\u2019 their item across, be it a URL or\na map location, to name just two.\nRequiring a passcode or a drawable\npattern to unlock your phone has long\nWrap-up\nAll in all, the changes ICS brings to\nAndroid are welcome and do offer a\ncompetitive alternative to consumers\nfrom other platforms in the smartphone\nindustry. Whilst the Galaxy Nexus may\nnot be the best Android phone on the\nhardware front, one distinct advantage\nis that it runs an unaltered version of\nICS. Essentially this means that it will\nalways be easier to update the phone\nwith the latest software, soon after it\nis released by Google. No more dependence on the whim of the phone\u2019s\nmanufacturer, whenever they are able to\nintegrate the update with their skinned\nversion of Android. Together, the marriage of hardware and software makes\nthe phone one mean machine.\nAndroid Beam allows you to quickly and easily share stuff between two phones\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 04 november 2011 23\nBUSINESS\nDear middle class voter, my words\nare addressed to you, dear friends:\nTwo hundred and thirty-five years\nago, when our fellow Englishman\nAdam Smith published his book titled\n\u201cThe Wealth of Nations\u201d, he promised that we would be far better off\nliving in a capitalist economy than\nany of the alternatives.\nCapitalism promised that every\nfamily would be able to afford the\nhome they lived in, that every family would have a car, that every family would be able to enjoy eating out\nwhen they wanted to, that every family would be able to send their children to daycare and to early education\ncentres, to school and to the univer-sity. In short, everyone who worked\nhard, who made enough sacrifices\nwould be enjoying a better and happy\nlife!\nBut look around! What is our current\nstate now? Few of us can afford to\nbuy a house, the City Council asks us\nto travel on Barclays bicycles instead\nof cars, what we will cook tonight depends on what item got discounted at\nSainsbury\u2019s or Tesco today, while the\ngovernment is scrapping the childcare tax credit accusing we are too\nrich, while they allow universities to\ncharge \u201cas much as they need\u201d for our\nchildren\u2019s higher education!\nSo, what went wrong? Aren\u2019t we still\ntaxed for the National Health Service\nas before, if not more? Aren\u2019t we still\npaying tax for the justice and police\ncorps as before? Aren\u2019t we paying\nthe council tax? Aren\u2019t we continuously told that our society is richer\nand more prosperous than it was in\nthe 1960s? Then, how come all of the\nwelfare system, all we have fought so\nhard for, be questioned today? How\ncan the healthcare system not be\nsustainable anymore, when it was in\nthe 1950s? Why is Higher Education\nmore expensive than ever?\nComrades, we have been cheated!\nStill nowadays, every worker in this\ncountry pays 40-50% of his income\nto the government. And if that is not\nenough, it must be because someone\nelse has managed to avoid paying\nwhat he should. Indeed, ever since\nthe reaganomics kicked in during the\nearly 1980s, banks, companies and\nthe rich have seen how their tax bills\ndecreased as their incomes skyrock-eted. They told us that by doing that,\neveryone would profit. But where is\nthat profit, if we live no better than\nour parents, if we see all they fought\nfor be destroyed or menaced?\nThus, why shouldn\u2019t the bankers in\nLondon, who are but leeches that\nbuild their wealth simply by moving\nmoney around, be taxed more? Why\nshouldn\u2019t the bankers, who caused the\nglobal financial meltdown in 2008,\nrescued by taxpayer money, and paying out huge bonus, be taxed more?\nFurthermore, when health care industries make a mistake, they apologise!\nWhen engineering industry causes\ntrouble, they apologise! When construction industry causes an accident,\nthey apologize! Then, how come the\nfinancial industry, which caused the\nglobal financial meltdown and, thus,\nmany of our sufferings, do not even\napologise for their reckless behav-iour?\nAnd instead, they ask for help from\nthe central bank, for the government\nto bail them out, for the taxpayers\nwho they despise to pay for their\nown stupidity. They claimed that if\nwe didn\u2019t help them, the Great Depression would happen again; those\nwords came from the same ones not\nso long ago claimed economic cycles\nhad disappeared! And us, poor idiots,\njust agreed to help them. And so we\nhave to face huge inflation as a consequence of our help, and while our\nmoney becomes less worthy as time\npassed by, they still maintain their\nbonuses and outrageous earnings as if\nnothing had happened!\nWhy, my middle class friends, do we\nhave to stand for such arrogance, such\nvillainy, such depravation? How can\nwe defend any longer a country where\n1% of the population controls 99% of\nthe wealth? Why do our own leaders kneel down in front of the City?\nSomething is rotten! Something is\nwrong! That is why, my dear friends,\nI urge you to stand up, say no, and\ngo and occupy Wall Street, go and occupy St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, go and occupy the Washington monument! Go\nand occupy and protest, before each\nand every one of us disappears one\nby one.\nEvery man a king!\n\u201cHow can you defend a country where 5% of the people control 95% of the wealth?\u201d\nComrade Juggernutx\nA random comrade with a Guy Fawkes mask (ironically, Guy Fawkes was\na Catholic reactionary), occupying a City Hall somewhere\nThis guy has obviously been silenced by a 1 dollar bill. Quite a bit cheap, really. The author of these lines\nwouldn\u2019t have sold himself for less than $1 million or, on second thoughts, for less than $1 mole\nTimeline\nOccupy Wall Street\n\u2022 15 December 2010 - present. The Arab Spring. A series\nof revolutions, demonstrations and protests in the arab\nworld motivated by the corruption and economic decline\nof their countries.\n\u2022 15 May, 2011. The 15-M Spanish Movement. Motivated\nby the devastating economic crisis and the indiference of\nits politicians, the spanish people celebrate massive and\npeaceful demonstrations, occupying Puerta del Sol square\nin central Madrid for weeks.\n\u2022 17 September, 2011. Occupy Wall Street begins. Social in-equality, corporate greed, politic collusion, and corruption\ntrigger this ongoing movement, occupying the Zuccoti park\nnear the seat of the New York Stock Exchange \u2013Wall Street.\n\u2022 15 October, 2011. Occupy London. The Occupy Wall\nStreet movement spreads worldwide. In London, protesters\ncamp in St Paul\u2019s Square, next to the seat of the London\nStock Exchange.\n\u2022 26 October, 2011. The Bishop of London and the City of\nLondon Corporation collude to expell the protesters. However, members of the Church of England, including the\nDean of St Paul, resign in protest against such a move,\nand the Bishop steps back.\n\n"

It offers a\nbreathtaking view lapped by the Arabian Sea,\nwith a unique confluence of the Talpone River\nto its left, it\u2019s tributary to the right, cradled by\nthe majestic Sahyadari range and a kilometre\nlong exclusive beachfront. Located at Rajbaga,\nCanacona, The LaLiT Goa is one of the most\nexquisite, beautiful and secluded Goa beach\nresorts. It is also the largest property in Goa in\nterms of area, as well as number of suites of-fered.\nThe Portuguese style architecture with an elegant blend of Goan culture is the base of the\nresort\u2019s twin storey sprawling structure - all\nnestled amidst formally landscaped gardens, a\ngolf course and a multitude of hotel facilities\nranging from modern meeting rooms to trendy\nbar and dining avenues, from beach activities\nto a holistic spa; and from water activities to\nsports facilities.

Having dabbled with the sights on offer I spent too-many-a-day relaxing on Patnem\nbeach. While Indian law dictates that no beach\ncan be private, the beach just in front of the The\nLaLiT Golf & Spa Resort certainly feels like\none: it\u2019s snugly nestled between geographical barriers on both sides, separating it from\nthe more busy strips of sand. And being west-facing, the location offers unrivalled sparkling\nsunsets over the sea.\nOf course, for the more enthusiastic sun worshipper the LaLiT offers all kinds of invigorating activities to keep you entertained, from jet\nskis, to fishing boats, to beach polo! Renting\na bicycle is highly recommended: I had a really great ride through some villages, checking\nout the awesome contrast of the inland mountains with the turquoise Arabian Sea. They\u2019re\neven geared up to beach riding, if you feel like\ntearing up the sand and picking up some new\nfriends (well, stray dogs who seem to take a liking to moving objects).\nFor ultimate lethargy, relax in a lounger by\nthe pool at The LaLiT: the swanky poolside\nsitting area is a great place to read a book and\ncatch some rays. And if that gets too tiring, you\ncan always swim over to the sunken bar for an\nice cold feni (a surprisingly delicious local liquor that comes in coconut and cashew variet-ies) before heading into the spa for a massage\nand a hot tub.\nVenturing further afield\nI mean sure, Goa is great and everything, but\nit\u2019s not the end of the line. It\u2019s perfectly located\nto allow you to zip up the coast to dusty Rajasthan through Bombay, or down the coast\nto tropical Kerala. If you\u2019re not too bound by\ntime and funds I\u2019d really recommend it: having\ndelved both north and south I\u2019d say that each\nhas their charms and shouldn\u2019t be missed.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 9\nFriday 04 NOVEMBER 2011\nOne of the most important roles of scientists is to communicate with the public and explain the results of their re-search. However, not many people have\nexceptional talent in science together\nwith excellent transferable skills. An example of a person who does is Professor\nRichard Dawkins, who recently gave a\nlecture at the Royal Albert Hall.\nThe main discussion topic of the lecture\nwas his new book, \u201cThe Magic of Reality\u201d. One book was offered to each ticket-holder of the event, though it is aimed primarily at children and young adults.\nFortheunenlightened,RichardDawkins,\nis a British ethologist, evolutionary biolo-gist, author of The Selfish Gene and The\nGod Delusion and the University of Oxford\u2019s Professor for Public Understanding\nof Science from 1995 until 2008.\nProfessor Dawkins started his lecture\nby explaining what kind of magic he is\ntalking about in his book. It is not the\nmagic of fairytales or Harry Potter. It is\nthe magic of the scientific results that\nexplain the world.\nHe said that we should be sceptical\nwhen \u201csupernatural miracles\u201d happen\nand he was sarcastic with the mythical\nanswers that people have used to explain\nthem during the centuries; \u201cAlthough\nscience is not able to explain everything\nyet, the supernatural can\u2019t explain any-thing. Everything we can\u2019t explain is\njust a new science challenge. We can\u2019t\nunderstand it yet, but we are working\non it\u201d. Each chapter of the book starts\nwith one or two mythical answers about\na philosophical and scientific topic and\nthen the scientific proof is presented,\nwhich according to Dawkins is much\nmore stunning.\nThe highlight of the lecture was the\nanswer he gave to the question \u201cWho\nwas the very first person?\u201d. The audience was surprised when he showed a\npicture of a fish, saying that this was\nwhat the first \u201cman\u201d looked like. But\nthen he explained that humans came\nabout by a process called natural selec-tion, without the need for a designer.\nAlthough each generation of the human\nbeings looks like the previous genera-tion, if you take two pictures that represent humans with a chronological difference of thousands of millions years,\nthen you will clearly see the difference\nbetween them.\nAnd that happened to all organisms\nthat have ever lived on earth. A minor\nstep from one generation to the following one may not be noticeable, but it\ncontributes to a great change after millions of years.\nBy the end of the event, Dawkins was\ninspiring, saying: \u201cScience is hard, but\nsometimes you need to work hard to\nlearn the truth. We need people to appreciate science; you don\u2019t have to play\nan instrument to appreciate music\u201d.\nPersonally, I believe that the \u201cMagic of\nReality\u201d can indeed help you appreciate\nscience and learn something more.\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nEver since Pluto\u2019s demotion from planetary status, astronomers have been on\nthe lookout for other similarly-sized\nand located dwarf planets. The region\nbeginning from the orbit of Neptune\nand extending away from us is known\nas the Kuiper belt, inhabited by rocks,\ndust, debris and large numbers of small\nplanetesimals and dwarf planets. Since\nits discovery in 1992, the known population of the Kuiper belt has increased\nto over 1000 objects, one of these being\nthe small dwarf planet Eris.\nDiscovered in 2005, it is thought to\nhave similar characteristics to Pluto and\nplayed a role in its re-classification as\na smaller \u2018dwarf planet\u2019. Astronomers\nhave been keen to observe Eris and\nits small satellite Dysnomia in greater\ndetail, but have thus far struggled due\nto its great distance from us \u2014 at 95.7\nAU, it is approximately 3 times further\nfrom the Sun than Pluto (1 AU being the\nEarth-Sun distance).\nNew research performed by scientists\nat Pierre et Marie Curie University and\nObservatory of Paris made use of a rare\nastronomical event \u2013 a stellar occultation \u2013 to gather detailed data about the\nsize, atmospheric composition and orbit\nof Eris. A stellar occultation is when a\nplanetary body passes in front of a background star, observable due to the resulting dip in stellar intensity. For Eris,\nthis happened on 6 November 2010, and\nanalysis of the gathered observations\nhas led to unexpected results.\nPrevious methods making use of\nsurface reflectivity and attempted direct imaging had provided conflicting\nresults about Eris\u2019s size. Dysnomia\u2019s\nmovements revealed Eris\u2019s mass to be\naround 27% greater than that of Pluto\nwhile their radii are approximately the\nsame, making the two planetary twins \u2013\nat least in size.\nConsidering its great distance, scientists had expected Eris to be much larger\nthan Pluto as the two are approximately\nas bright in the sky. As this was shown\nnot to be the case, the value for Eris\u2019s albedo became more important in consolidating the results. Albedo, a measure of\nthe reflectivity of the planetary surface,\ncan range from 0 to 1, where 1 represents a white surface that reflects all\nthe light that falls upon it and 0 a black,\nnon-reflective body. The observable\nbrightness of Eris led scientists to expect\na high visible albedo, confirmed through\nthis study to be approximately 0.96.\n\u201cThis unusually bright surface is difficult to reconcile with the idea that objects in the outer Solar System become\ndarkened by cosmic rays and microme-teorite impacts over time,\u201d says Amanda Gulbis, a visiting scientist in Earth,\nAtmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \u201cThe new observations could\nthus support a long-standing theory that,\nas a large, icy, Kuiper-belt object approaches the Sun during its orbit, a putative atmosphere could sublimate and\nthen condense out as the object moves\nfarther away.\u201d\nThis supposed atmosphere was a main\ntarget of the study; stellar occultations\nprovide ideal conditions under which to\nmeasure planetary atmospheres, as the\nstellar light travels through the cloud of\ngases surrounding the transiting body.\nThe atmosphere of Eris was shown to\nbe barely-there \u2013 it is thought that Eris\u2019s\n\u201cbright surface [is] possibly caused by a\ncollapsed atmosphere, owing to its cold\nenvironment\u201d, as barely-there amounts\nof nitrogen, argon and methane and\na low surface pressure suggest an extremely tenuous Pluto-like atmosphere.\nPlanetary exploration studies such as\nthis one are essential to discover more\nabout the most unreachable areas of our\nsolar system, and to learn more about\nplanetary formation, evolution and\ncomposition. The full research is published in Nature.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10550\nNicola Guttridge\nThe Magic of Reality\nDwarf planet Eris is Pluto\u2019s twin\nWhy we allow fear to take control\nIt was a dark, misty, eerie night this Halloween. I was walking alone through a\ndeserted, narrow street in London. The\nsound of footsteps behind me made me\nstart. I stopped and listened. The noise\nstopped. I carried on walking. The footsteps started again. All my senses were\nheightened. I began to wonder if someone was in the dark behind me. The\nfootsteps got nearer. My heart started\nracing, palms started sweating. The\nfootsteps got louder. Fear took over and\nI started looking for somewhere to run,\nto hide, to get away.\nWhat I was experiencing at this moment is fear related to an unusual external event. This is also known as \u2018phobic\nanxiety\u2019. Phobic anxiety developed in\nus as prey animals, as a means to respond to predators in the vicinity that\nmay be threatening our lives.\nThe neurobiology behind phobic\nanxiety is complex. Studies in rats have\nshown that exposure to the odour of a\ncat, which generates a phobic anxiety\nresponse, causes various changes in the\nrat\u2019s physiology. Corticosterone (analo-gous to human cortisol) levels increase\nand turnover rates of dopamine, sero-tonin, noradrenaline and GABA in various brain regions are altered. The anxiety created by exposure to cat odour (for\na rat), or exposure to the eerie stranger\nthat may have been following me above,\ncomes in the form of a sudden fear and\nsudden arousal of the nervous system.\nThis phobic anxiety developed in us to\nallow us to respond to a sudden change\nin our environment.\nNow most people can understand\nfeeling anxious when walking down a\ndark alley alone and hearing footsteps\nbehind you. On the other hand, some\npeople are constant worriers. I have\nfriends who constantly stress and worry about everything: whether they offended their neighbour in halls, whether\nthey have enough money on their oyster card, whether they\u2019ve done enough\nreading for tomorrow\u2019s lecture. This\nform of anxiety can be termed \u2018generalised anxiety\u2019. Again neurotransmitters\nand hormones such as corticosteroids,\ndopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline\nand GABA are involved; however with\nthis form of anxiety their patterns of\nrelease and uptake are different. Generalised anxiety has a slightly different\nevolutionary purpose. In prey animals,\nit stops them from entering unfamiliar,\nopen spaces, where they might be likely\nto encounter a predator. It stops them\nfrom feeding on foods that may be toxic.\nGeneralised anxiety is often something\nwhich doesn\u2019t change too much within\nthe individual over time \u2013 you\u2019re either\ngenerally a worrier or you\u2019re generally\npretty chilled out.\nSo next time you\u2019re worrying about\nlife, or clutching your pillow watching\n\u2018Scream\u2019, just remember that there are\nsome pretty interesting evolutionary\nreasons behind what you\u2019re feeling.\nMaya Kaushik\nxxx\nAn artist\u2019s impression of Eris and its moon, Dysnomia.

In just one show Dior had sin-glehandedly created a \u2018New Look\u2019, with sweeping\nskirts filled with netting that hovered at mid calf\ntopped with moulded bodices that accentuated the\nbust, all pulled together with a tiny wasp waist and\nelegant satin gloves. It was a completely new shape\nthat was all at once voluptuous and feminine, marking the start of a new war free life and giving hope\nto luxury and the return to traditional values. -AY\nIconic: Dior\u2019s \u2018New Look\u2019\nFlawlessly polished and effortlessly elegant, To\nCatch A Thief was the epitome of 50s glamour and\nsophistication. Cary Grant plays an ex-notorious\njewel thief in immaculately fitted suits; dapper\nsports jackets and sleek tuxedos, whilst Grace Kelly\u2019s wardrobe is beyond perfection, having been designed by the acclaimed stylist Edith Head. Kelly\u2019s\nflowing white floor-length dress has now become\na timeless wardrobe staple for the affluently stylish around the globe, and her ice blue chiffon gown\nwith a transparent scarf flung oh-so-casually around\nher shoulders had rich American heiress nailed in a\nsingle shot. If you\u2019re ever lacking style inspiration,\nTo Catch A Thief is your go-to film. -AY\nIconic: To Catch A Thief\nIt\u2019s not as much the shape or length of the poodle\nskirt which emerged in the 50s as the \u2018casual skirt\u2019\nthat makes it so appalling, more so it is how literal the\npoodle skirt was. The fashion world is one that appreciates the art of subtlety, yet the poodle skirt is quite\nliterally a skirt, with a poodle on it. Worn as everyday\ncasual wear, starting in America, the poodle skirt took\na new generation of young girls and plumped them\ninto large swinging bold coloured felt skirts and ankle\nlength white socks, slowly pushing out the elegance\nand sophistication of the decade. Admittedly, the\nskirts gave the impression of a tiny waist, but they\nwere often worn with shirts and matching neckties,\nsomething few others bar Olivia Newton John and Co\ncould pull off, and even then, the \u2018Grease\u2019 cast at\nleast had the sense to their poodle-free. -AY\nHorrific: Poodle Skirts\nA bad fashion statement from America? How unsur-prising. The Jazz Age, undeniably produced some\nlegendary music, but unfortunately this came with\nthe popularisation of the Zoot Suit. The name in\nitself already says a lot, but for a more visual de-scription, imagine Simon Cowell with his trousers\nbelted at the waist, combined with those old school\nscallys that wore socks over their trackies, and you\njust about have the picture. The Zoot Suit: Highwaisted trousers with buffering wide legs pegged at\nthe ankles \u2013 male harem pants gone terribly wrong,\nmatched with long shapeless coats with wide padded shoulders. A truly ghastly look, how did anyone\never think they could pull it off? -AY\nHorrific: Zoot Suits\n1\n9\n4\n0\ns\n1\n9\n5\n0\ns\n1\n9\n6\n0\ns\nIf ever there was a cinematic fashion moment in\nhistory that made it into the record books, it would\nbe a certain Miss Holly Golightly in her little black\nGivenchy dress, pearls and opera gloves, sipping\na coffee and munching a croissant outside the Tiffany\u2019s flagship in New York in the opening credits of\nBreakfast At Tiffany\u2019s. The black dress (whose iconic\nstatus is secured in place by its very own Wikipedia\nentry) sold for \u00a3467,200 at Christie\u2019s auctioneers\nin London in 2006, to an anonymous phone bidder\nwho, no doubt, was intent on recreating the moment\nherself. -SV\nIconic: Breakfast at\nTiffany\u2019s\nMaybe it was that potent cocktail of home-brewed\nbeer, pot, LSD and unwashed hair that set into\nplace a movement that popularised such an obscenity as the tie-dye t-shirt. Emerging in the\n1960s along with some of the all-time greatest music ever composed, somehow the level of creativity\ndidn\u2019t quite translate to those who listened to it.\nThose who considered themselves hippies thought\nthemselves better than basic hygiene, good taste,\nshoes and bras. And so came the tie-dye t-shirt:\na psychedelic concoction of every colour in the\nrainbow on what once was a perfectly good white\nt-shirt. -SV\nHorrific: Tie-dye\n\n"

    "content": "order to commend the gospel to thinking\nmen and women today. In an increasingly\nsecular culture, people have questions\nabout the truth of the Christian world-view, and to ignore or turn aside questions\nof that nature would be irresponsible. It\nseemed to me that it was a natural thing\nto do: to explore the philosophical foundations of and justification for my own\nChristian faith.\nMoving on to your current UK tour,\nlet me ask you: why did you decide to\ncome to UK and deliver talks such as\nthis one (at the Bethinking National\nApologetics day conference)?\nWell you have to understand that for a\nlong time, I\u2019ve been an Anglophile. I love\nthis country; when my wife and I married,\nwe honeymooned in London, and we always come back whenever we can. When\nI did my doctoral work in Philosophy I\ncame to the university of Birmingham,\nso we lived and I studied here. Since then\nwe\u2019ve come back on sabbatical to do re-search, so when we got an invitation to do\na university speaking tour in the UK we\njumped at the chance.\nWith the UK being a more secular society than the US, do you notice a difference in the way that you\u2019re taken in by\nthe public here, and do you get a different reaction in the UK than you would\nF\nirstly, Dr Craig, thanks\nvery much for coming\nalong to speak to us, we\nappreciate you taking the\ntime to enrich the Imperial College students.\nDr Craig: My pleasure.\nI just want to get a little of your personal background and ask: when did you\nfirst become interested in Philosophy?\nI think my interest in Philosophy developed during my University years, I took\nsome courses in Christian Theology and\nthen Philosophy, and courses in literature\nas well. That really sparked my interest in\nquestions that were philosophical in na-ture: What is truth? How do we discover\ntruth? What is the truth in the Christian\nworld-view? It was during those upper\nyears of university study.\nWas religion always the focus of your\nphilosophy?\nOf my philosophy, yes, but it wasn\u2019t always the focus of my life; I wasn\u2019t raised\nin a Christian home or even in a church\ngoing family, but my interest in religious\naffairs preceded my interest in Philosophy. I\u2019m a philosopher because I\u2019m a\nChristian, my philosophy flows out of my\nChristian faith.\nWhen did you decide that you wanted\nto make your philosophy, and your reli-gion, the focus of your career?\nWell, I think this emerged gradually in the\ncourse of my university and postgraduate\nstudies. I saw that these deep philosophical questions needed to be addressed in\nin the US?\nI don\u2019t think that I see a difference per-sonally, because the people that come to\nour meetings are very interested. We\u2019ve\nbeen speaking to packed houses, and\nso I don\u2019t see the indifferent, apathetic\nperson who doesn\u2019t care about these\nthings. By the very nature of the case,\nthe people that come to see my speak\nare interested even if they\u2019re sceptical\nor agnostic or atheistic. There\u2019s a kind\nof self selection that goes on and so I\nrecognise, in that sense that we\u2019re not\nseeing the broader British public, but\nthose who do care about these issues.\nIn a recent lecture at Imperial College London you cited 7 pieces of rational evidence that would lead us to\nthe conclusion that the Christian God\nexists. Why do you think that some\npeople who are learned in the sub-ject, including people you\u2019ve debated\nsuch as Sam Harris and Christopher\nHitchens, don\u2019t accept these pieces of\nevidence as sound and correct?\nWith reference to the two examples\nyou\u2019ve named, with all due respect, I\ndon\u2019t think they do know a lot about\nthe subject. I have debated both of these\ngentleman in public forums and at uni-versities, and Christopher Hitchens\u2019\nlack of familiarity with the issues was\nastonishing. Similarly with Sam Harris,\nhe was just impotent even to defend his\nview against criticism.\nI think that so often, these folks are\nso deeply embedded in a secular world\nview, and interact so rarely with people\nwith a different perspective, that they\u2019re\nutterly unaware of the literature. They\ndon\u2019t read people like me, they don\u2019t\nparticipate in conferences with people\nlike me, they don\u2019t invite people like\nme to share a platform with them as I\ndo when I invite them. There really\nis a tremendous ignorance; many of\nthese folk rejected the Christian faith\nas young people (11 or 12 years of age)\nand they\u2019ve never studied it since.\nHaving said that, there certainly are\nmany who are philosophically informed\nand have a different take on the issue,\nand I would say a difference of opinion\nis possible on these deep questions. I\nhave no desire to insult the rationality of\natheists or others who disagree with me.\nI respectfully disagree with them and I\npresent my arguments and evidence and\nit\u2019s up to people, with an open mind, to\naccept or reject them.\nYour view that it is a rational conclusion to accept that God exists would\nlead me to the conclusion that there\nis no room for faith in the Christian\nbelief system. Do you think that there\nis a need for faith?\nI think it absolutely does leave room for\nfaith. In the new testament the concept\nof faith is not a way of knowing some-thing, it is a way of trusting in some-thing, of committing to something. For\nexample, several years ago I had corneal surgery on my eyes.\nAs you can imagine, before I let myself go under the knife, we carefully\ninvestigated who was the finest corneal\nsurgeon in the US, and then based on\nthat evidence, I trusted him to make the\ncut on my eyes. Similarly, when someone comes to the conclusion that God\nexists, then the decision of faith arises.\nAm I going to commit my life to this\nperson and trust him? The evidence\ncan actually bring you to the decision\nof faith.\nIn a hypothetical situation in which\nyour rational pieces of evidence could\nbe refuted to a level with which you\nwere satisfied, and were able to recognise that they were refuted, would you\nstill have your beliefs or would it be the\ncase that it would become irrational for\nyou to believe in God?\nI would still have my belief, because my\nbelief in God is not based on these argu-ments. These arguments are confirmatory\nof my belief in God. I think my faith in\nGod is based on the inner witness of God\u2019s\nspirit to my own heart. I have a personal\nrelationship with him, his spirit lives within me, and while there are good arguments\nand evidence to confirm that, my faith is\nnot based upon them.\nI think this is a wonderful thing because most people in the history of the\nhuman race have had neither the time,\nnor the education, nor the library resources to investigate the philosophical arguments for God\u2019s existence or\nthe historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, and so they would be\ncondemned to unbelief if this were the\nonly way of knowing God. But God, in\nhis mercy, has provided an interior way\nof knowing that he exists which is open\nto all persons everywhere regardless of\ntheir education, their time or their re-sources. For those of us who have the\nluxury of leisure time, university educa-tion, and fantastic library resources, we\nhave a double advocate.\nIn addition to this interior way we\nhave these exterior arguments which\nsupport it. What\u2019s also good about this is\nthat I can hold these arguments lightly.\nIf a refutation comes along, I don\u2019t have\nto go to the wall to the defend these ar-guments, I can give them up easily. This\nhelps me to be more, rather than less,\nobjective about the validity and soundness of these arguments.\nIf you were faced with an atheist, and\nyou were trying to convince him that\nGod exists, do you think it would be\nmore effective to address it from the rational standpoint, or do you think trying to convince him from this internal\nstandpoint that you mentioned would\nbe more effective?\nI don\u2019t think it has to be either/or. I think\nit can be both/and. I would share with my\natheist friend these arguments and pieces\nof evidence that I find compelling but\nI would also remind him that the search\nfor God is not some sort of disinterested\nacademic discussion like adding another\npiece of furniture to your view of the\nuniverse. This is a deeply existential and\npersonal quest that needs to be pursued in\nhumility and with openness of heart and\n\u201cHitchens\u2019 lack of\nfamiliarity with the issues was astonishing.\u201d\nInterview: William Lane Craig\nSam Horti talks to the renowned Christian philosopher about his work\nWilliam Lane Craig lectured at Imperial College earlier in October\nChristopher Hitchens \u201cdoesn\u2019t know a lot about the subject\u201d says Dr. Craig\nJoseph Letts\nFEATURE\n6 FELIX\nFriday 04 november 2011\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nVanity Fair\n\n"

Produced by anime powerhouses\nGainax and I.G. Production, it\u2019s certainly one the\ncraziest pieces of fiction that I\u2019ve ever seen.\nThe show opens the young Naota being run\nover by the Vespa riding Haruko Haruhara, a tall\npink haired woman claiming to be a member of\nthe Galactic Space Police Brotherhood. She then\nproceeds to hit him with her guitar, which opens\nup a portal in his head which allows various alien\nrobots to pass through. As the series progresses\nthis is revealed to be part of an extraterrestrial\nplan to destroy the Earth, with only the Japanese\nImmigration Department standing in the alien\u2019s\nway. Like I said this is a strange show: a show set\nin a universe in which people don\u2019t find it strange\nthat a \u2018company\u2019 called Medical Mechanical has\nbuilt a giant steam iron shaped \u2018factory\u2019 in the\nmiddle of their town; where scooters can be used\nas spaceships and where guitars are the most powerful weapons in existence.\nThis week on Twitter\nSome top tweets from Felix TV\u2019s\nfollowers and followees\n@FelixTelevision\n@TheNatFantastic I do consider other people, and, as someone who maintains a Twitter\naccount for their own vagina, I\nconsider you eccentric.\nThere are shows you watch for mindless enter-tainment. There are shows you get hooked to,\nones you simply need to watch every week.\nAnd then there are shows that come to define\nso many aspects of your life. For me, Buffy the\nVampire Slayer is just that show.\nIn 1992, a man called Joss Whedon had a\nunique idea: what if, instead of the silly little\nblonde girl who walks into an alley and gets\nkilled in every horror movie, that same girl turns\naround and beats the crap out of her attacker? It\nwas an idea that would result in a cultural phe-nomenon.\nStarring Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy Summers, the first episode introduces audiences not\nonly to the main characters of the show, but also\nto the mythology of vampires and magic - \u201cIn\nevery generation there is a chosen one. She alone\nwill stand against the vampires, the demons and\nthe forces of darkness. She is the Slayer.\u201d Every\nSlayer has a Watcher, whose purpose is to guide\nand train the Slayer. In Buffy, this job falls to\nRupert Giles, played by Anthony Stewart Head,\nthe stuffy librarian at Sunnydale High School.\nVery early on, Buffy is joined in her mission by\nWillow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicho-las Brendon), together forming \u2018the Scooby\nGang.\u2019 Season One of BTVS is told in a \u2018monster/mystery-of-the-week\u2019format which worked\nwell in the initial stages, but it quickly became\napparent that audiences were more interested in\nthe relationships between the characters and not\nso much the scary demons.\nLong before Edward and Bella there was\nBuffy and Angel. Stephanie Meyer can eat her\nheart out, the love between Buffy and Angel is\nthe ultimate human/vampire romance and one\nthat all future relationships will be compared\nto and, inevitably, fall short of. This is passion\nand heartbreak the way it\u2019s meant to be and the\nevolution of their relationship is the real driving\nforce behind Season Two. Seth Green joins the\ncast as Oz, while vampires Spike and Drusilla\nbecome the Big Bad of the season.\nAmongst other things, BTVS is a prime example of a show with consistently improved\nwriting. After a very rocky start in Season One,\nby the time high school is over and Season\nFour comes around, there is really very little to\ncriticize. This is also the point where Whedon\u2019s\ncreative genius becomes even more apparent\nand garners him his first Emmy nomination\nfor \u201cHush,\u201d the truly creepy episode with no\ndialogue. The following seasons feature more\ncomplex storylines and the writers continue to\nshow us that life doesn\u2019t stop being painful after\nhigh school, it just develops into a different kind\nof pain. The Season Five episode \u201cThe Body\u201d\noffers viewers an hour of television unlike any\nI have seen before or since (incidentally, it recently won an Emmy in the Drama Category\nfor Television\u2019s Most Memorable Moment),\nwhereas \u201cOnce More, With Feeling\u201d allowed\nJoss Whedon to realise his dream of producing\na musical. Full of engaging characters, amazing acting and witty dialogue, Buffy is one\nof the few shows that is unafraid to take risks\nwith character development and by the end, the\nScoobies barely resemble the insecure teenagers\nwe met in Season One. Everyone has shades of\ngrey, but do bear in mind that nobody is safe in\nWhedon\u2019s world\u2026\nIn its seven year run Buffy the Vampire Slayer\ncleverly used its supernatural elements as metaphors for real-life issues \u2013 high school resting on\nthe mouth of hell, anyone? It was never a show\nthat shied away from tackling controversial topics ranging from addiction, grief, sexual orienta-tion, attempted rape and murder to feelings of\nalienation, teenage rebellion, atonement, death,\nlove and all the things in between that define us.\nAt times comedy, at times horror, but mostly a\ndramatic portrayal of life, the show gathered a\ncult following that lives on today. Not only that,\nBuffy is also notable for attracting attention\nfrom academics and is often studied in Popular\nCulture Studies, as well as being the first show\nin U.S. television history to feature a long-term\nlesbian relationship among the core characters.\nMost importantly though, it managed to do what\nit originally set out to do \u2013 empower women. It\nshowed the industry that it is possible to have\nstrong female leads without objectifying them,\nas was the case with for example Xena \u2013 Warrior Princess.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of vampires, magic and all\nthings mystical then I do recommend you watch\nthis. Buffy is the show that brought vampires\nback from the dead (pun completely intended,\nsorry) and made them cool. If you do watch it\nand find yourself enjoying it, then never fear,\nBuffy lives on. There was a spin-off series \u2018Angel\u2019, which ran for five seasons, and both shows\nare being continued in comic book form. Linked\nto REM\u2019s \u2018Everybody Hurts\u2019, Buffy came into\nmy life over a decade ago and has become a\npermanent fixture. As clich\u00e9d as it may sound,\nit helped me through some tough times and for\nthat, I will be forever grateful.\nThe plot isn\u2019t actually that difficult to under-stand, at least if you watch the show a couple of\ntimes. It\u2019s certainly infinitely more comprehensible than another of Gainax and I.G. Production\u2019s\ncollaborations: End of Evangelion. At its core the\nstory is mix of standard coming of age and space\nopera elements, albeit with a very touching end-ing.\nThe real draw here is the humour. The surreal\nnature of the show is perfectly complemented by\nHaruko\u2019s general insanity. There\u2019s also the intentional comically inconsistent art style, with a short\nbut hilarious South Park parody in episode 5. This\nis one example of numerous references to, and\njokes about, other anime, rock music and popular\nculture in general. Gainax clearly wasn\u2019t afraid\nof a bit self parody: in the second episode when\nNaoto\u2019s otaku father begins spouting pretentious\nnonsense about philosophy Naota explains to Haruko that he \u201conce wrote a book about the deep\nmysteries of Eva\u201d.\nI would also be remiss not mention the music,\nperformed by Japanese band \u2018The Pillows\u2019 considered by many to be the best part of the show.\nI usually have no interest at all in music and so\nfor me to notice it must truly be exceptional. The\nsongs used are fast paced, fun and really fit the\nshow, with the closing theme being particularly\ngood.\nThis is the very good series. While it might take\none or two episodes to get accustomed to the its\nsurreal and silly nature if you stick with it you\u2019re\nsure to be rewarded. At six episodes it\u2019s also very\nshort, so there\u2019s really no excuse for not seeing it.\nAn extraterrestial plan to destroy Earth\nBuffy \u2013 a cultural phenomenon\nTELEVISION\n@LuciaPodhorska\nreviewing my absolute favourite TV show of all time for the\n1500th issue of the Felix =\nPRESSURE!!\n@rimmer152\n\u2018prostitutes are rough in Amsterdam, one of \u2018em got me to\nwash my old man in the sink\u2019\n\u2018you took your dad?\u2019\n@FelixTelevision\n@TheNatFantastic I think\nyou are posher than a Posh\nCheddar Cheese and Pickle\nBaguette, but are in denial,\nbecause you don\u2019t like sandwiches\n@TheNatFantastic\nCan\u2019t help but think that posh\nboys are having a go because\nI\u2019ve committed the cardinal sin\nof Being In Possession Of An\nOpinion & A Vagina.\n\u201cA vampire in love with a Slayer!

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX\n26 Friday 04 NOVEMber 2011\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nmust say; I was rather taken\naback by the hullabaloo caused\nby my (somewhat overempha-sised) opinions when I reviewed\nthe Jeremy Kyle show a few\nweeks ago, and for that, I extend my\napologies to anyone who was offended\nby it. I have never professed to be any\ngood at this writing malarkey \u2013 evidently my tongue-in-cheek style and\nexaggeration were not recognised by\nsome people. Oh well!\nFor those of you unaware, in short,\nmy article said that the point of the Jeremy Kyle show is to make you laugh at\nthe participants (this is patently obvious from every single camera shot of\nthe audience). It also highlighted the\nfact that it elevates the viewer\u2019s ego. I\nmay have also vaguely mentioned my\nopinion that not many participants are\nactually good, decent, hardworking\npeople (it really was very subtle, I\u2019d be\nsurprised if you noticed it).\nAs expected there was some negative feedback online... slightly more\nthan anticipated but nevertheless, these\nthings happen! I think my favourite\ncomment was as follows: \u201c[I] hope\nto never see such awful dehumanisa-tion and hideous treatment of fellow\nhumans in Felix again\u201d. Other commentators generally flocked towards\nthis opinion and thus a prevailing hypothesis was formed; that I, George\nBarnett, am entirely to blame for the\nway in which guests on the Jeremy\nKyle show are portrayed, treated and\n\u201cdehumanised\u201d.\nIf, by enjoying the show for the merits in which the producers expect it\nto be enjoyed, I am dehumanising the\nguests, then what on Earth are Jeremy\nKyle and the ITV production crew doing to them? Helping them? No, that\u2019s\nnot it. Well not entirely anyway. BaitAlexander\nKarapetian\nGeorge Barnett\nFloat like a social butterfly...\nAresponse to all of the critics\ning them to provide entertainment for\nothers? Oh, there we go! Even \u2018Angry\nGeek\u2019 pointed out that \u201cthe production\nteam heavily cherrypick their guests to\nmaximise whatever effect they\u2019re going for that week\u201d. It seems then, that\nwe, the blissfully ignorant viewer, have\nfallen into ITV\u2019s cunning programming trap! Oh, damn and blast!\nMany of the negative comments on\nmy article pointed the finger at me \u2013\nfair enough, I wasn\u2019t exactly polite\nabout the guests \u2013 but they didn\u2019t point\nthe finger at anyone else who watches\nthe Jeremy Kyle show. Surely they are\nas much to blame as I am? Okay maybe\nnot quite as much... Nevertheless, here\nis a question for those people: how\nmany of you have written to ITV to\ncomplain about how The Jeremy Kyle\nShow dehumanises, mistreats and generally makes a mockery of its guests?\nIt would be much to my surprise if any\nof you had even thought about doing\nsuch.\nIt\u2019s all well and good telling me that\nI\u2019m in the wrong for the tone I used, or\nhow \u201cvile and hateful\u201d my review was,\nbut what use is that? It may dissuade\nme, or even someone else, from writing articles of a similar ilk for the next\nfew months. But what\u2019s the point if\npeople continue to watch the show for\nwhat it is \u2013 \u201chuman bear baiting\u201d? Too\nmany people are willing to point the\nfinger and condemn the actions of others solely for the purpose of occupying\nwhat they perceive to be the moral high\nground. If you negative commentators\nreally believe in what you said, then all\nI ask of you is to write to ITV and complain about the show.\nI have to say, it was much to my\ndelight when the following week, a\ncertain apoplectic nerd took it upon\nthemself to write an article which was\nY\nou may notice a story\nI ran in the Science\nsection last week regarding a study which\nlinked the amount of\nFacebook friends to the size of an individual\u2019s grey matter. It is interesting to\nnote that there have been many studies\nwhich have correlated changing brain\nstructures to internet usage. Although\nwe must not misinterpret correlation as\ncausation in any case, we can discuss\nthe potential implications.\nI guess you could call me a bit of a\nsocial butterfly. I try to maintain various social circles and keep up with\nfriends.\nMy Facebook profile? Similar story.\nI tend to add friends of friends who\nI meet in Real Life, I guess I\u2019m a bit\ntrigger happy with the add button. As a\nresult, my news feed is an amalgamation of approximately 830 people from\ncollege and beyond.\nI used to be strictly opposed to joining Facebook (classing it the same as\nMySpace). I decided to give it a go and\nnoticed myself adopting new traits.\nOften, when I check the news feed,\nI feel compelled to scroll down to the\npoint at which I last checked it. If I\nhappen to see anything particularly in-teresting, I bring it up to the relevant\nfriendship group offline. One could\nargue an internal schema of a friend\u2019s\nonline presence is built in memory,\nand although one may see their friends\nin the real world often, the online presence is somewhat loosely attached and\nadds another dimension to the interaction structure.\nIt\u2019s this extra dimension on top of basic interaction which provides the basis for my suggestion that if our brain\nstructures are being modified slowly\nby internet usage, then this could very\nwell be the next stage of evolution for\nman. We often can\u2019t quite put our finger on the various underlying assumptions we make when detecting emotion\nduring online chat, and how our brains\nin essence a personal attack aimed directly at me. Which is fine, because it\nwas much more interesting than the\nusual shit churned out by aforementioned author (sorry, but I don\u2019t think\nI\u2019m the only one with this opinion). So\nif my article was condemned for being\noffensive...then why was it okay for\nthe cowardly Angry Geek to write an\noffensive article directly aimed at me\nbehind the refuge of their cheap nom\nde plume?\nAngry Geek \u201chates us all\u201d (this is\nsupposedly a \u201cbaseline\u201d) \u2013 surely\nthere\u2019s reason for this hate? Do we not\nshare your opinions about something,\nMr. Angry? I\u2019m guessing not. That\u2019s\nwhy you hate us, because we don\u2019t\nagree with you, right? Are we not worthy of being your equals oh esteemed\nangry one?\nYou\u2019ll have to bear with me for the\nrest of this paragraph, I fear that some\nof you may not agree... right \u2013 here\ngoes. The way I see it is that, by hating everyone (for whatever reason it\nmay be), you segregate yourself from\neveryone else, which by default creates\na divide. Now, whether you consider\nyourself above, below or even aside\nfrom everyone else, you are still separated from them. Still with me? Good.\nSo saying that I promote inequality is\na bit sanctimonious and hypocritical,\nisn\u2019t it?\nMy conclusion is two-fold. To those\nnegative commentators: if you\u2019re going to do something, then do something\nworthwhile. Don\u2019t write personal comments or attacks from your perceived\nmoral high ground. Take action against\nthe root of the problem, ITV, not the\nintermediary. And to Angry Geek, I put\nit to you to join us, stop being a coward\nand reveal your identity! Enlighten us.\nCome on, it\u2019ll be fun! You know you\nwant to! We can have a proper debate\nabout what really annoys us instead\nof communicating like monkeys with\ntypewriters.\nare being affected is uncertain.\nThe ever-increasing barrage of information we consume from a wide gamut of devices presents a challenge for\nall of our minds. Our episodic memory\nis essentially extended to virtual happenings and we potentially remember\nmore than we thought we could. Ultimately, adding 500 people to your\nFacebook profile tomorrow isn\u2019t going to boost your memory, but keeping track of their activities might help\nmake it more fluid over time. Let\u2019s\nhope a future generation, which may\nlook back to our collective online con-sciousness, can see it as an advancement rather than a great waste of time.\nGet a magnifying glass and tilt your head to read the offending article\n\u201d\n\u201d\nHow many of you\nhave written to ITV\nto complain?\n\u201c\nHow ma\nHow m\nhave w\nhave w\n\n"

This allows for\nmore free trade between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, who have fought four\nwars against each other since their independence in 1947. Pakistan had hesitated\nin making the move due to pressure from\nits powerful military which has controlled\nthe country for most of its history. However,\nwith the military failing to control terror in\nPakistan while the Indian economy booms,\npressure grew to introduce the deal. Political commentators have had mixed reactions as to whether it will actually help the\nlong term peace process.\nA Guide To the American\n2012 Presidential Election\nCampaign\nOn the 17th December 2012, the next President of\nthe United States of America will be formally elected.\nWhile the incumbent President, Barack Obama is the\nmain candiate for the Democratic party, the Reuplican\nParty candiates are still battling for selection as their\nparty\u2019s nominee.\nSo, the question is \u2013 who\u2019s who?\nPresident Barack Obama\nPresident Barack Obama is the main\nDemocratic candiate for the Presidential Elections. As the incumbent\nPresident, Mr. Obama has experience on his side, however failure to\nmake promised changes due to resistance in Congress from the Republican Party, high unemplyment\nand an insistance on bipartisan politics might be\nstumbling blocks as he campaigns for a second term\nin office.\nHerman Cain\nAs a former CEO of restaurant chain\nGodfather\u2019s Pizza and a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City, although he has little\npolitical experience Herman Cain is current seen\nas the most popular Repulican candidate. His 9-9-9\nfederal tax plan to aims to simplify tax collection to\n9% taxes on business, personal income and sales.\nHowever recent allegations of illegal campaign funding and past sexual harrassment may leave Mr. Cain\u2019s\ndreams in tatters.\nMitt Romney\nSecond in the Republican nomination\nrace according to recent nationwide\npolls, Mitt Romney, a former candidate for the 2008 Presidential Campaign, is keen to convince voters that he is their cham-pion. As a former governor as Massachusetts he has\nsome experience in politics, however his Mormon faith\nmay deter some convervative Christian voters from\nsupporting his cause. He also faces some confusion\nregarding his opposition to the President\u2019s healthcare\nbill, despite implementing a similar scheme while in\nMassachusetts.\nMichele Bachmann\nAs a Republican member of the\nHouse of Representatives and the\nfounder of the House\u2019s Tea Party\nCaucus, Congresswoman Michele\nBachmann is no stranger to the political arena. Keen\nto remove federal minimum wage and firmly against\nPresident Obama\u2019s healthcare bill she paints a picture of a fierce political warrior.

Mick and Bianca Jagger (pictured), one power-couples of the\nera (along with Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg,\nand Andy Warhol and his wig) advocated the look\ndu jour, at once both nonchalant and immaculately\nput together. Such textures as denim, leather, fur,\nsilk and lace were combined with perfect \u00e9lan. The\nlook was characterised by a heavy dose of accessories \u2013 bug-eyed sunglasses, piles of jewellery \u2013\nsound familiar? -SV\nABBA. The word alone is enough to conjure a nightmare of horrible euro-disco-pop music and primary-coloured, sparkling all-in-ones - the likes of which\nhave now been relegated to the confines of the\nStrictly Come Dancing wardrobe department. Too\nmany rhinestones, too many metallic touches, and\nway too much hair. Add to that nauseating picture\na pair of knee-high matching platform boots and\nyou\u2019ve just about got everything that was horrible about the number one Swedish export of the\n1970s. Though the flared trouser silhouette has\nmade it into Autumn/Winter 2011, thankfully those\nmen\u2019s all-in-ones have remained staunchly in the\n1970s. -SV\nHorrific: ABBA\nIconic: Glamorous\nRock\u2019n\u2019Roll\n1\n9\n8\n0\ns\nAs much the King of Pop as a genius of style, Michael Jackson re-invented his look in the 80s resulting in a slimmer silhouette with a daring dash\nof added colour. The release of \u2018Thriller\u2019 in his familiar red jacket with sharply sculpted shoulders\nfollowed by the crystal-encrusted orange leather\njacket embellished with zippers that appeared in\n\u2018Beat It\u2019, brought to the fashion world a theatrical\nlook that is still envied today. Dazzling sequins,\nsingle white gloves and tipped trilbies, along with\ncropped pants worn over bright white socks and\nblack loafers were so highly integrated by MJ\nthat they have become as iconic as his legendary\nmoonwalk. -AY\nThere\u2019s no denying that Madonna has had some\ndefining fashion moments throughout her neverending career, however, the 80s were definitely not\nher peak. Over gelled, unnaturally orange, and with\nprobably a few too many cans of hairspray, Madonna\u2019s 80s hair do was, in all honesty, horrendous.\nIn her youth, she experimented with the punk rock\nlook, but unfortunately, it just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\nWrists overloaded with spikes, oversized hideous\ncrosses pulling down her ears, a black stud piercing over her lip, and a braided dreadlocks matching\nfishnet tops and far too much flesh on show, Madonna\u2019s 80s look was anything but her lucky star.\n-AY\nHorrific: Madonna\nIconic: Michael Jackson\n1\n9\n9\n0\ns\nLong before the days of Arizona Muse, Abbey Lee\nKershaw and Freja Beha Erichsen, even before the\ndays of Kate Moss, there once lived the original su-permodels, the ones that took the phenomenon of\nthe model off the catwalk, and into the household.\nNaomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz, Cindy Crawford \u2013 bright-eyed\nand beautiful in the iconic Peter Lindbergh photograph taken for British Vogue in January 1990.\nThese women, along with Helena Christensen,\nClaudia Schiffer, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Heidi Klum et al\nbecame the iconic faces that launched a thousand\nbrands. -SV\nLet\u2019s just make one thing clear: Clueless is one\nof the all-time greatest movies made, ever. Ever.\nAnd even though the fashion moments exhibited\nthrough the movie are truthful, that does not make\nthem any less heinous.

    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 04 NOVEMBER 2011 45\nThe Descendants\nPros: George Clooney is on his career-best form as a clueless father trying to connect with his daughters after an unfortunate accident leaves\nhis wife in a coma. As a family drama, The Descendants adds much wit\nas well as genuinely heart-warming scenes. Director Alexander Payne\u2019s\nprevious works About Schmidt and Sideways were both heavily praised.\nCons: If you love Payne, then it\u2019s easy to keep loving him. But if his\nlow-key, subtle humour isn\u2019t to your liking, Payne isn\u2019t someone who\nwill change. He is unique, but that means he has his share of critics who\naren\u2019t fans of his work.\nJ.Edgar\nPros: Directed by Clint Eastwood, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, this film\nhas Oscars written all over it. Based on the compelling true story of the\ncontroversial man who ran the FBI utilising several questionable methods\nin the name of justice, the plot itself couldn\u2019t be more exciting. Plus, DiCaprio has been tapped for months to be the front-runner for Best Actor.\nCons: When there is this much hype resting on one film, if there is even\none single misstep, there will be cries of disappointment from audience\nmembers who were expecting great things.\nMidnight in Paris\nPros: Critics hailed the return to form of Woody Allen, with his newest\nromantic comedy set in the French capital. The nostalgic, easy-going,\npleasantly-paced journey was one of this year\u2019s most romantic, embracing films, and Allen (acting as both director and writer) certainly deserves\na lot of credit for that.\nCons: Allen\u2019s films haven\u2019t made the Best Picture list in decades. It\nwould take an all-out masterpiece to break this curse, but is Midnight in\nParis that film? Probably not.\nThe Iron Lady\nPros: Starring Meryl Streep playing a strong, determined, independent,\nmuch celebrated real-life woman (Margaret Thatcher), you would have to\nseriously screw it up to not get any awards buzz around this. This could\nwell turn into this year\u2019s The Queen, given how it\u2019s expected that Streep\nscores her ridiculously overdue third Oscar with this one.\nCons: The Iron Lady has been absent from all the major festival circuits\nthis year (Venice, Toronto, London, New York), making us slightly worried about the studio\u2019s faith in the film.\nMy Week with Marilyn\nPros: Michelle Williams\u2019 uncanny resemblance and remarkably close\nportrayal of Marilyn Monroe is already generating strong buzz. With a\nsupporting cast including some of Britain\u2019s finest (the legendary Kenneth\nBranagh, national treasure Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi, Dominic Cooper,\nEmma Watson and UK\u2019s rapid rising star Eddie Redmayne), My Week\nwith Marilyn certainly shows promise as a fun autobiographical romp.\nCons: Initial reviews have been mixed, with several reviewers accusing\nthe film of being nothing more than a shameless Oscar vehicle for Williams. Aside from Williams\u2019 masterful performance, the rest of the film\nhas been described as \u201cflimsy\u201d and only \u201csporadically entertaining.\u201d\nTake Shelter\nPros: A haunting disaster film showing, more often than not, that great\nperformances can terrify you more than tons of computer graphics. Take\nShelter is certainly one of the more deserving candidates in the race. Featuring Michael Shannon on his most magnetic form as a family man who\nis plagued with visions of the apocalypse, this carefully nuanced, thematically brilliant film is an unforgettably intense ride.\nCons: Being a disaster film it is no doubt a massive downer, which will\nheavily affect its box-office intake. Very few people might end up seeing\nthis, and will struggle to build momentum all the way towards February.\nWar Horse\nPros: Based on a Tony Award winning play, directed by Steven Spielberg\n\u2013 no film comes with a bigger package than this. Even without starring\nany internationally acclaimed actors, this has enough going for it to generate sufficient buzz.\nCons: A lot is riding (no pun intended) on the newcomer Jeremy Irvine,\nwho nabbed the leading role after beating many more well-known British\ntalents. He has the heavy task of single-handedly selling the film, which\nis tough, especially for a Spielberg film that is bound to be a grand spec-tacle.\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\nPros: Based on the massively successful trilogy of books that spawned\nthree huge films, this has the advantage of having a rock-solid material to\nwork from. David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) is certainly someone who\ncan turn this into the thriller of the decade.\nCons: The pressure is on, and the audience won\u2019t be so kind when comparing every single aspect of the book, and the original film, to this one.\nRemakes are never popular to begin with, and this could work as a major\ndisadvantage.\nThe Artist\nPros: Ever since its debut at Cannes, reviews have been staggering, praising Jean Dujardin\u2019s performance, as well as its magical technical accom-plishments. \u2018Utterly delightful\u2019 and \u2018wonderfully inventive\u2019 are some of\nthe terms that have been used to describe the artistic mastery.\nCons: It\u2019s been a while since a foreign language film landed a Best Picture nomination. To make matters worse, this is a black-and-white silent\nfilm. Will the Academy go for something so old-fashioned?\nShame\nPros: Michael Fassbender gives a compelling performance as he bares\nall (both physically and mentally) to play a successful single male struggling with sex addiction. It\u2019s a tricky subject matter, but paired again with\nHunger director Steve McQueen, Shame is one of this year\u2019s most provocative pictures, one that commands your attention.\nCons: Slapped on with an NC-17 rating, the highest age restriction that\ncan be placed, this will prevent a whole lot of people from watching. The\nsubject matter of sex addiction, as well as its numerous explicit scenes, is\nnot a great selling point, which will make it hard for the studio to generate\nan effective campaign.\nDrive\nPros: This was the surprise critical hit of this year \u2013 making a nice mix of\narty cinema and brutal action. Sure, for that idiot who was expecting Fast\n& Furious and eventually sued, Drive was not the film for her, but that\nshouldn\u2019t stop the rest of us from enjoying its powerful visual style, Ryan\nGosling\u2019s remarkable performance and some kick-ass action.\nCons: Too mainstream for the Oscars? But not mainstream enough to\ncount on its popularity to score a Best Picture nomination. The box-office\nreturns have been relatively disappointing, without lasting effect.\nAlbert Nobbs\nPros: Playing a woman who dresses up as a man to work as a butler\nin 19th Century Ireland, the five-time Oscar nominated Glenn Close is\nsimply incredible and is definitely one of the front-runners for the Best\nActress award. There is also plenty of warmth and touching scenes generated as Close begins to fall for a young woman.\nCons: Critics are pointing out how this period piece is nothing more than\na ploy to get Close that Oscar.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nFELIX\n12\nTips & Hacks\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 november 2011\nBooming sound in your pocket\nWhat does the future hold?\nI want to see the digital home. Let me paint\nyou a picture: you get to your front door, grab\nthe handle and it unlocks. Forget keys, forget\nswipe cards, forget even retina scanners; your\ndoor unlocks based on instant DNA analysis.\nJust inside, a notification on a touchscreen\nlets you know you got post today. Individually, you can read each item of post, delete it,\nor even send it off to the computer in some\nother room. Then you can deal with that item\nof post when and where you\u2019re ready.\nThat sort of interconnectivity should be\npresent in everybody\u2019s homes. Say you\u2019re\nsitting at your desk and you suddenly remember you need milk. You\u2019d simply access the\nfridge from your computer and tell it you\nneed milk \u2013 then the fridge will automatically\nadd it to your next food shop. Even more than\nthat, let\u2019s say while you\u2019ve been out you\u2019ve\nworked on some files on your phone or lap-top. As your device enters your personal WiFi network, those files will automatically be\ndistributed to all your home devices. The\nwhole house should be connected so you can\nwork on anything, anywhere.\nPerhaps we can even go a step further than\nthat, and remove the need for multiple devices altogether. If we can really harness the\npotential of graphene, I\u2019d love to see a true\nall-in-one device. Somewhat akin to a recent\nSky advert, imagine an edge-to-edge touchscreen phone. But when you sit down on the\ntrain, you literally unfold your device into a\ntablet with twice or even four times the screen\nspace. At its most unfolded it could be used\nwith a wireless keyboard and mouse to create\na desktop, or even just attached to the wall to\nact as a television. That would be truly mobile\ncomputing.\nMoving slightly away from the world of de-vices, I would like to see augmented reality a\npart of everyday life in fifty years. The technology will hopefully have moved out of ugly\ngoggles and outstretched smartphones and\ninto contact lenses or our everyday glasses.\nWith that accessibility issue sorted, and the\ninevitable processing power increases that\nwill enable all these gadgets, augmented reality can really prosper.\nMore than just overlaying buildings with\ntheir names, we should be looking at personal\nand contextual information. Our augmented\nreality gear should interact with our calendars,\nour smartphones, and even have a degree of\nintelligence. Consider my earlier example of\nthe digital home \u2013 if you marked your milk as\nan urgent purchase, your gear will be alerted\nof this. When you leave the house, a computer\nin your house will have found out which local\nshop has your preferred milk for the cheapest\nprice, and you\u2019ll have the option of being led\nto it, overlaid on your vision.\nPerhaps though, you left home to attend an\nimportant meeting, and are following the visual guides to get you there instead. On the\nway back your route could be altered slightly\nto get your milk, and perhaps your eyepiece\nwill even recommend a new restaurant for\ndinner based on where you\u2019ve previously eat-en. As long as all of this is helpful and done\nunobtrusively, there are so many possibilities\nfor augmented reality, especially given fifty\nyears of development.\nIn fact, helpful and unobtrusive need to\napply to all our future technologies. As technology inevitably becomes more and more\ningrained in our everyday lives, the last thing\nwe want is for it to get in the way. Technology should be and needs to be a convenience.\nWith that in mind, we will hopefully be seeing huge advances in the next fifty years in\nnew technologies that make our everyday\nlives that much easier, and hopefully more\nenjoyable.\nThis does beg the question, though, of\nwhether or not everything I\u2019ve described in\nthis article can happen in the timespan of half\na century. Based on the history of technology,\nand how quickly the field has burst through\ninnovation after innovation \u2013 I don\u2019t see why\nnot. Of course, only time will tell. But as we\nare being speculative, one person\u2019s thoughts\nand predictions aren\u2019t enough. So, take a look\nacross the page, where some other people\nlook at what they think we might be seeing in\nIssue 3000 of Felix...\nScosche\u2019s boomCAN is a small, portable speaker\nthat promises big sound at a low price. It certainly does deliver booming sound \u2013 this thing\ngets loud. Even with your music on a quiet volume\nthe boomCAN packs quite a punch. The price tag\nmeets requirements too, as it costs only \u00a320.\nIt\u2019s a well-built little thing too \u2013 the build quality\nseems good \u2013 and you get a travel pouch to protect the aluminium body. The internal battery is\nmeant to last up to seven hours of playback, so\nit should last for a trip out \u2013 which is where I see\nthis speaker being used. The only problem is with\nthe quality at higher volumes \u2013 at the end of the\nday this is a cheap speaker, and you can tell when\nyou turn it up. You can buy a second boomCAN\nto get proper stereo sound, but at \u00a340 you can\nprobably get something of slightly higher quality.\nHowever, for a budget speaker that turns it up to\n11, the boomCAN is recommended.\nDisagree with our hastily\nwritten articles and\npoorly worded opinions?\nShow us better:\ntechnology.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHail to our future overlords... maybe\nChris Bowers tells of his predictions for fifty years\u2019 time\nA\nh, Issue 1500 is here. While\nsome of my fellow editors may\nbe getting nostalgic, technology and history don\u2019t seem to\nget along. Technology and the\nfuture, on the other hand? Well, everyone sees\nthem as going hand-in-hand. So we\u2019ve decided\nto jump 1500 issues into the future \u2013 approximately fifty years \u2013 and look at what the world\nof computers, gadgets and electronics might\nlook like in Issue 3000 of Felix.\nOf course, when we think of technology\nin the future, some questions immediately\nspring to mind \u2013 will robots rule the world?\nWill we be able to teleport instantly from one\nplace to another? Probably not. While that\u2019s\nquite a shame for the latter, a lot can happen in technology in fifty years. If we went\nback in time just a decade and told them what\ntechnology was like today, they probably\nwouldn\u2019t believe us. That\u2019s the sort of growth\nwe\u2019re looking at. So what do I think we might\nbe talking about in these very pages half a\ncentury from now?\n\u201cSome questions spring\nto mind - will robots rule\nthe world?\u201d\nCheck the results of the Vizz\nAfrica SIM card competition at\nwww.vizzafrica.co.uk/result\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nshow ever, but it\u2019s definitely not as famous and popular as it should be. It\u2019s\nfrom the creator of Seinfeld, Larry David. The shows centres around a fictionalised version of Larry David and his\ngeneral trials and tribulations; for Larry,\nthey are a lot, as he can\u2019t help but stick\nhis foot in his mouth.\nCurb Your Enthusiasm is typified by\nfeaturing one big arc per season that is\nbeautifully woven into the individual\nstand-alone episode. These episodes\nfeature several plots that all somehow\nintertwine and join up in a way that will\nmake you howl with laughter.\nThere are also plenty of seasons to\ncatch up on, so it\u2019s perfect procrastination material. If you want a starting\npoint, episode 8 of season 3, \u2018KrazyEyez Killah\u2019, where Larry befriends a\nrap artist, is my personal favourite epi-sode.\nFELIX Friday 04 November 2011 41\nBrilliant shows you\u2019ve never heard of\nChannel 4\u2019s latest culinary offering is\na scientific blend of classics such as\ndon\u2019t-watch-it-with-your-parents Embarrassing Bodies and Supersize vs\nSuperskinny. All three programmes\nfeature C4\u2019s basic ingredients of Grand\nDesign-esque houses and arty long\nshots, grisly bodily close ups when you\nleast expect them and celebrity doctors\nwho seem to spend far too much time\non TV and no time on the skiing holidays my GP frequently enjoys.\nWhere The Food Hospital differs\nis that its scientific content is (on the\nwhole) well researched, rational and\nunsensational. While the makers of the\nLast week, I wrote a column about how\nmuch I love Arrested Development.\nIt was in this obscure student publication called Felix, you probably haven\u2019t\nheard of it. Inspired by this, I decided\nto write about other, slightly obscure,\nTV shows that I love. Mainly, because I\nwant more people to talk to (read: quote\nincessantly at) about them. So, put your\neyes roughly 5mm below, and you can\nsee some hidden TV gems. Okay, you\ncan\u2019t see them, but you can see my writing about them\u2026\nArcher\nI put this first as it\u2019s by the same people\nwho made Arrested Development. This\nis evident in some of the humour involved and a few of the voices.\nThe show centres around Stirling Archer, a super-spy at ISIS, and the rest of\nprogramme did use the phrase \u2018food\nas medicine\u2019 perhaps a few too many\ntimes for my liking \u2013 you wonder how\nmany viewers with the not uncommon\ndiseases featured will now recklessly,\nif optimistically, throw out their medication and start stuffing their faces\nwith vegetables and food replacement\nshakes, there were a lot of good messages and sensible science put across.\nMost pertinent was the scene in\nwhich a breast cancer sufferer was offered advice on the recent changes she\nhad made to her diet in the hope of preventing her cancer recurring. Perhaps\nChannel 4 have been rebuked over the\nadvice given in the past by \u2018Dr\u2019 Gillian McKeith, but they managed to\nthe office. The first thing you\u2019ll notice\nis that it\u2019s a cartoon. But wait, don\u2019t\nturn your head and snort in disgust at\nme \u2013 I\u2019ll admit there is some stigma attached to cartoons, people almost seem\nto think that they cannot possibly match\na live action show. To those I say, that\u2019s\nyour opinion and you\u2019re entitled to it.\nI then point them to Futurama, a show\nthat makes you cry like a man who\u2019s\njust been dumped by a girl, while she\nis simultaneously squeezing lemons and\nonions in his eye.\nThe show is just so cleverly done, and\nthe way Archer basically has a conversation while he is on a mission always\ngets me. Then there are the one-liners\nthat you can quote to your hearts content (yeah, weird, I also thought that expression was \u2018till your heart\u2019s content\u2019\nbut apparently it\u2019s not). My favourite\nbeing: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the grade sand,\nbut, course\u201d, said by Archer to his long-suffering servant Woodhouse when or-Tim Arbabdazah dering him to buy sand, that will later\nbe used to punish him (not in that way).\nAll of the characters are voiced well\nand developed. The plots are all brilliantly done, with the humour dropped\nin and not feeling forced; by that I\nmean, the irritating way that suggests\nthey came up with a joke then worked\na plot around it.\nIt\u2019s currently in its 3rd season, all being worth a look. Once you start, you\u2019ll\nend up in the danger zone, trust me.\nYou\u2019ll also get that reference!\nThe Life and Times of Tim\nAnother cartoon for you, don\u2019t worry,\nthe next will be live-action I swear.\nThis really is a great hidden gem of a\nshow. I\u2019m not just saying that because\nthe main protagonist shares my name\n(and maybe looks a bit like a cartoon\nversion of me?).\nTim, from the show, is a mild-man-nered Imperial student. No, wait, sorry,\nthat\u2019s me. The other Tim, is a mild-mannered worker with a desk job at\nOmnicorp. He always seems to manage\nto get himself into horrible situations,\nwhich usually end up badly for him.\nPeople in the show are always misinterpreting what he says, or just misquoting\nhim, making you want to shout at the\nscreen in anger at his mistreatment.\nThe other characters are all inter-esting. The Boss (not Rick Ross) is\ndefinitely my favourite character. He\njust always comes out with something\nfunny. Such as the time he called Tim\ninto his office to test him by seeing how\nhe copes under pressure. Rather than a\npublic speaking challenge, he decided\nto proposition Tim. Rivalling The Boss\nfor favourite character is Tim\u2019s friend\nStu. His highlights include convincing\nTim that fighting an old man counts\nas charity as \u201crather than building a\nbridge, you\u2019ll be breaking the bridge of\nan old man\u2019s nose\u201d.\nThe episodes are split into two different segments. You\u2019ll also notice that\nthe graphics are much cruder than Archer, or other cartoons for that matter.\nI think that\u2019s what makes it so appeal-ing, in a way. It\u2019s got a sense of homemade fun. It looks and feels like it\u2019s\nbeing made by a bunch of people who\nare doing it because they love making\nfunny sketches, not because they want\nto make money. With only two seasons\nto catch up on, before the third comes\nalong, and no exams in sight, you have\nzero excuses to not watch this show.\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\nOkay, I know, it\u2019s not the most obscure\nsensitively handle the emotive issue of\nbreast cancer and also firmly remind\nviewers that \u2018We can\u2019t cure cancer with\nfood. We can\u2019t.\u2019 A number of subtly-inserted phrases such as \u2018best evidence\nsuggests\u2019 were not used as caveats but\ninstead as reasoning behind the opinions the panel of experts suggested,\nwhile a series-long randomized trial\ninvolving viewers gives the promise of\nan insight into a \u2018real\u2019 scientific study.\nFollowing the public response to the\nprogramme via the ever-ubiquitous\nTwitter hashtag revealed a mainly\npositive viewer response, with many\nTweeters were praising the considered\nopinions and calm tone of the hour-long programme, while others seemed\ndisappointed that food wasn\u2019t actually\na replacement for conventional medi-cine.\nApart from the visual impact of diabetic phimosis in high defenition (I\nwouldn\u2019t Google it), my only grievance with The Food Hospital was the\nclunkily engineered happy ending, involving a doctor using a small child\u2019s\ndrawings as a rudimentary pain scale.\nWhile \u2018more research is needed\u2019 is\na forbidden phrase in the publishing\nworld, I would definitely like to see the\nresults of these nutritional remedies\nover a longer time period. I\u2019d also like\nto see if The Food Hospital keeps up\nthe good work in terms of sensible non-senationalist science broadcasting.\nThe Food Hospital is better than hospital food\nThe name\u2019s Archer, Stirling Archer\nLarry David is deep inside you\nHelen Wilkes\nYeah, that\u2019ll make you better love\n\n"

With a combination of persuasive power, begging and bribery we\u2019ve managed to get together\nthreeofGamingsection\u2019sbiggestwriterstotalkaboutvideogamingthroughtheages,\nas well as what they think the future holds in store when Felix 2000 rolls around...\nFELIX\n50 Friday 04 NOVEMBER 2011\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s June 1978, and Felix is celebrating its 500th\nissue being printed. Meanwhile, on the other side\nof the world, Japanese arcades are playing host to\na videogame that will become a monument in the\ngenealogy of the medium \u2013 Space Invaders has just\nbeen released by Taito. Itself an evolution of the\npopular Breakout arcade machines, Space Invaders used popular sci-fi themes (the first Star Wars\nfilm had been released only a year earlier) and the\ncombination proved a hit with players, to the point\nwhere there was a temporary shortage of 100 Yen\ncoins in Japan shortly after its release.\nIn a far more muted debut, Nakamura Manufacturing Ltd. rename themselves to Namco and release their first game under the new name \u2013 Gee\nBee. It receives a mixed response compared to\nSpace Invaders, but in less than two years Namco\nwill release Pac-Man, ensuring their place in the\nnext three decades of the games industry.\nIn the US, a small group of MIT students are\nhard at work on one of the first interactive fiction\ntitles ever. The first version of their game, Zork,\nhad been finished in 1977 a year earlier, but it will\ntake the four-man team another year to finish the\ngame off completely. It would go on to found a\nhuge genre (now sadly relegated to niche communities by and large) that would lead into adventure\ngames, point-and-click puzzlers and a half-dozen\nmore sub-genres, as well as inspiring a generation\nof writers and designers to work with videogames.\nIn terms of hardware, the revolution brought by\nthe Atari 2600 the previous year is still the big talking point. The machine was one of the first home\nconsoles to use microprocessors in a big way, as\nwell as popularising the cartridge as a means to\ncontain and sell game data. In 1978, the machine\nwas still known as the \u2018Video Computer System\u2019\nand came bundled with Atari\u2019s Combat. It wasn\u2019t\nmuch, but the console would become so widespread and popular that Atari would become a\nword describing a games console in some parts of\nthe world for most of the next decade.\nThe 2600 cost $199 on release \u2013 expensive, but\ncheap in comparison to similar machines released before it. This was a time when 8 kilobytes of external\nmemory was considered so extravagant thatAtari limited their hardware to just half that. RAM for the entire\nsystem was just 128 bytes, mostly because of a fierce\npush towards small system sizes and limited resource\nuse. But the results paid off \u2013 the console was acces-sible, and once Atari had established themselves with\nhits like Pac-Man the 2600\u2019s position was secured.\nThe industry is a strange place in the late sev-enties. Home consoles are beginning to take centre stage from the arcade cabinets, and hardware\nis slowly beginning to climb the slope of afford-ability versus power that would lead to explosions\nin popularity around the time of the NES and,\nlater, the PlayStation. In the same length of time\nbetween the launch of World of Warcraft and the\npresent day, gaming went from consoles like the\n2600 (whose hardware duplicated the left and right\nsides of the screen to enable simple arcade games\nlike Pong) to the release of Super Mario Bros. in\n1985. While we\u2019ve certainly seen similar leaps in\ngaming since World of Warcraft (OnLive being of\nparticular note, perhaps) the technological leaps\nand bounds being made in the late seventies are\nunimaginable to the gamers of today.\nThis is the most exciting annual review we\u2019ve\never written at Felix Games! Not only are we beginning the brand-spanking-new year of 1995, but\nwe seem to be entering into nothing short of a new\nera of videogame history. Both Sega and Sony\nhave now unleashed unto Japan their state of the\nart CD-based consoles, whilst Nintendo is still\nkeeping its cards close to its chest. Whether or\nnot the Ultra 64\u2019s software cartridges prove sturdy enough to withstand the laser-read edge of the\nnew console CD-format is unimportant; the battle\nfor console supremacy is going to be a spectacular\nshow whatever the result. We wouldn\u2019t normally\nbet on the newcomer Sony and its PlayStation,\nbut the reports from Japan of Tekken\u2019s smooth\n3D graphics sound almost too good to be true. We\nonly wish there was a way for us to see it in motion sooner.\nFelix Issue 500: 1978\nMichael Cook\nThis stuff\u2019s so retro even hipsters don\u2019t know what that console is\nFelix Issue 1000: 1994\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\nBut all this talk of the future has distracted us\nfrom the past highlights of the gaming year. Our favourite speed running blue hedgehog (as opposed\nto the tyre-flattened brown variety we get over\nhere) got his second sequel and proved once again\nthat other platform heroes are still choking on the\ndust of Sonic\u2019s breakneck blockbuster gameplay.\nNintendo\u2019s star effort this year was the more sedate\nbut no less engrossing Super Metroid, which blew\nus away with its atmosphere and masterful world\ndesign.\nBut the two Japanese giants had stiff competition\nfrom the west, with even the Macintosh computer\ngetting a look in with an impressive debut title\nfrom Bungie called Marathon, a FPS with some\ninteresting innovations that made Bungie one to\nwatch. Over in Texas, id Games released the terrifying Doom II, once again turning PC screens\neverywhere into portals into Hell.\nBut Hell is a far cry from the lush green fields of\nEngland, which has proven itself a fertile ground\nfor home-grown game developers. Chelsmford\u2019s\nSensible Software graced the Amiga with the fantastic Sensible World of Soccer, whilst over in\nTwycross Rare gave arcade gamers everywhere\nthe brutal Killer Instinct, before proving itself a\nworthy risk for Nintendo by taking its Donkey\nKong licence and producing one of the best looking games we\u2019ve ever seen; Donkey Kong Country.\nAlongside these advances there was also some\nloss, as Tennis for Two creator William Higinbotham passed away. His little beams of bouncing\nlight were the first glimmers of the giant videogame industry that exists today. He couldn\u2019t predict how important a part of entertainment history\nhis oscilloscope experiment would prove to be,\nany more than we can predict the future of this new\ngaming era. But we\u2019d like to think that he may look\nwith as much wonder as we do, at how diverse and\nexciting gaming has become today.\nHere\u2019s to 1995 folks, and the future of our wonderful hobby.\nAhh, back when gaming was good and I\nwasn\u2019t a cynical husk of a human being\nYou wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible to\nsuffer from a nostalgia-induced hernia\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n28\nARTS\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 november 2011\nDespite evidence pointing to the contrary, the\nname Ralph Fiennes is not synonymous with that\nof Lord Voldemort. Fiennes, who made his name\nat the Royal Shakespeare Company, is in fact a\nseasoned Shakespeare actor and proves his worth\nplaying Prospero in Trevor Nunn\u2019s production of\nThe Tempest.\nIn an earlier time the Duke of Milan, Prospero\nis now confined to an island with his daughter Miranda.Bringingtotheislandhisenemiesbymeans\nof a tempest, Prospero schemes, with the help of\nsprites and spirits, to give his daughter in marriage\nto the King of Naples\u2019son, whilst plotting revenge\non his usurping brother. In the end, everything is\nforgiven, although perhaps not forgotten\nThe Tempest, comical though it may be, is also\nlight and ethereal and melancholic. The magical\ncreatures populating the play are beings whose\npresence should lull the audience into a state of\nwonder. Prospero\u2019s final monologues articulate\nthe mind of a man whose life is perhaps not over,\nbut is certainly close to the beginning of its end.\nWith this, as well as the beauty of the text in mind,\none would think The Tempest sturdy enough to\nsurvive almost any production. And yet, it can\nbarely lift its head under the drudgery and vulgarity of Nunn\u2019s production.\nMusic is vital to any staging of The Tempest,\ndriving much of the action and present in many\nof the scenes. Of no recognisable style, Nunn\u2019s\nchoice of music can only be described as kitsch\nin the worst sense of the word. Costumes belonging to human characters were simply boring; anyone expecting any magic from the sprites was to\nbe sorely disappointed by their garish garments.\nEven the slave-sprite Ariel, played with passion,\nalbeit rather squeakily, by Tom Byam Shaw, was\ngrounded, metaphorically speaking of course \u2013\nthere was copious flying involved \u2013 by his shiny\nturquoise outfit.\nThere was plenty of magic, swordfights and\nlove affairs taking place on stage, but somehow\nthe actors struggled to find, and maintain a pace,\ncrucial to the successful outcome of any play. Fiennes in particular, was disappointing in the first\nact; he was rarely able to relate to his co-actors\nand appeared somewhat lost, for want of a better\nword. His second act thus came as a pleasant sur-prise. Perhaps borrowing from Prospero\u2019s powers,\nFiennes delivered his monologues with a sombre\naplomb and tragic nuances, his powerful voice\nrising and falling smoothly. The rest of the cast\nwere as good as the directing permitted. Nicholas\nLyndhurst as a very lanky Trinculo was particularly hilarious in his drunken scenes with Clive\nWood, who played an equally drunk Stephano.\nThey provided comic relief from a boredom that\nwas felt too often.\nThe Tempest has now reached the end of a successful run at the Theatre Royale \u2013 and one must\nthank Fiennes for the lift, both on stage and off,\nthat he gives to this production. Although this\nleaves us without the chance to watch yet another\nfamous actor on the West End stage, it will hopefully make way for something better.\nThe Tempest has since finished\nNothing stormy about Trevor\nNunn\u2019s Tempest\nEva Rosenthal\nFour days in and Ralph was already sick of people asking for Movember donations\n\u201cOne must thank Fiennes\nfor the lift... that he\ngives to this production\u201d\nThe Poet\u2019s Column\nTime\nby Pavitar Devgon\nThe clock sits ticking on the wall\nI turn away and forget the fall\nI drum a rhythm to stay the beat\nBut nearing soon comes the meet\nI move away and light the night\nAnd never look down from the height\nFor when I see, it beckons me\nAnd leads to the land of three\nHere I make a spade to dig\nA key to lock, a knife well hid.\nFor time will come and rest a while\nNo longer will the tick resound\nTime will stop and stay its style\nIts journey never homeward\nIt never works; it never stops\nIt runs on far ahead\nIt sees my plight but laughs and sighs\nAnd counts in rhymes then jumps and flies\nI\u2019m lead on further and fear grows deeper\nUmasked by pain and loss\nAnd when the light is iridescent, I know the time\nhas won.\nI gladly concede the long race is over\nAnd that I\u2019m not the only one.\nA warm welcome back from ARTSOC!

If you want to see your work appearing here, do get in touch. Additionally, those interested in joining Poetry\nSociety, contact Osas, at osamudien.\nomoigiade@imperial.ac.uk.\nAny production of Cool Hand Luke is going\nto be compared with the 1967 Paul Newman\nfilm. It perhaps shouldn\u2019t be this way but it\ncan\u2019t be helped. I would love to treat it as just\nanother play but it is truly in the shadow of\nan icon. So when casting the leading man,\nyou\u2019re in for a tough job from the start. A\nquiet but confident leader of men with a hint\nof cheekiness and swagger coming out of his\narse. Enter Marc Warren.\nThis guy rose to fame as the suave but cocky\nDanny Blue in Hustle and he\u2019s a large reason\nwhy the show was such a success. He is a brilliant actor and since then has even managed to\nconvince Virgin TV to adopt his bravado. But\nI\u2019ve never seen him on stage before and was a\nbit apprehensive as he\u2019s known for his incredibly expressive eyes, something that will only\ncome across on film. I was disappointed to\nRanulf Kinloch-Jones find out that my initial fears were somewhat\ncorrect. On paper he should be great. He does\n\u2018play it cool\u2019 all the time, but somehow it\u2019s\njust a bit flat. He lacks a certain cheekiness\nor twinkle that makes the audience invest in\nthe character. This mixed with surprisingly\npoor stage fighting and general effects (for\ninstance no sign of blood when someone gets\nshot) makes the eventual climax kind of a bit\nempty.\nHaving said this there are redeeming features\nthat make it watchable. Lee Boardman\u2019s performance as Dragline (Luke\u2019s best friend) is\nawesome. He paces a mixture of comedy and\nsincerity perfectly throughout the play and to\nbe honest steals the show because of it. The\nset design was also fantastic with slick changes\nadding to the atmosphere.\nIn summary, it\u2019s not the best thing you\u2019ll ever\nsee but is definitely watchable. It holds your\nattention for its short running time of about 1\nhour 40 minutes but won\u2019t stay with you for\nany longer than that. It was an impossible act\nto follow the film, and it was a valiant effort.\nCool Hand Luke runs at Aldwych Theater\nuntil November 19\nFrom Hustler then to Hustler now\nSuave? Swagger? It\u2019s the guy off Hustle\n\n"

    "content": "Like Crazy\nPros: This year\u2019s Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, this refreshingly honest modern Romeo and Juliet adaptation (this time the couple\nis separated by immigration laws, as an English student is not allowed into\nthe States) is touching and mature, much like the impressive performances\nits leads give.\nCons: It\u2019s a teen love story, and there is nothing so dramatic and impactful\nthat would quality this for serious consideration. Sure it\u2019s sweet, often heartbreaking and an accurate depiction of long-term, long-distance relationships,\nbut it\u2019s too low-key to be a massive hit.\nFILM\nFELIX\n44\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 NOVEMBER 2011\nThe Ides of March\nPros: Who doesn\u2019t love a solid, controversial political thriller full of schemes\nand duplicitous characters? Backed by an all-round ensemble cast, George\nClooney\u2019s latest directorial effort is a gripping one, despite familiar themes.\nCons: It\u2019s not ground-breaking or distinctive enough, which will be trouble if\nstronger candidates appear later in the year.\nThe Help\nPros: A film that took America by surprise (the box-office receipts stand at\n$170 million, against its modest $25 million budget), the well-acted, stirring\nand surprisingly hilarious portrayal of African-American maids in 1960s Mississippi was an instant hit with the audience, turning into the most feel-good,\ncrowd-pleaser of year.\nCons: The general public embraced it, but several critics remain sceptical.\nToo much detail is glossed over, and for the serious subject matter that still\nstands to be a controversial issue even to this day, the light-hearted approach\nand several clich\u00e9d characterisations weren\u2019t so well received.\nHugo\nPros: Directed by Martin Scorsese \u2013 enough said.\nCons: It would appear Scorsese has sold out to the 3D craze. Now we need\nsomeone like Woody Allen to convert his films into 3D to know for sure that\nthis extra dimension is here to stay. But seriously, Hugo is a major departure\nof genre from the man who gave us some classics such as Goodfellas, Raging\nBull, and Taxi Driver. Instead, Hugo is a kid\u2019s adventure film full of visual\neffects. It\u2019s a tough genre to compete with in the Oscars, and Scorsese really\nneeds to break some new ground to be even considered.\nWe Bought a Zoo\nPros: Despite its odd title, there is a reason why Cameron Crowe\u2019s latest is\nin the running. Matt Damon lands a strong role as a single father trying to\nraise his two distant children whilst keeping up with his household work that\nincludes looking after a zoo. And the theme of an inexperienced father reconnecting with his children whilst finding new love (Scarlett Johansson, that\nlucky bastard) is a formula that has gone down well in the past.\nCons: It looks like a good Christmas film for the whole family, which means\nthe Oscars may not quite warm to it come decision time. After all, family\nfriendly films hardly ever manage to win.\nExtremely Loud and Incredibly Close\nPros: How we deal with grief is a popular theme during the Oscar season.\nA young boy (Thomas Horn) loses his father (Tom Hanks) on 9/11 and he\nmust rebuild his life with his mother (Sandra Bullock). It\u2019s an uplifting story,\nbacked by a range of fantastic supporting actors, with Bullock already generating awards buzz for her performance.\nCons: Is the world ready to be reminded of the 9/11 tragedy? Watching the\nterrorist act recreated on screen is quite another experience to go through\naltogether. And a lot hangs in the balance of newcomer Horn. If he screws up,\nthe rest of the film can forget about winning any awards.\nMoneyball\nPros: Uplifting sports dramas are always popular with the Academy and\nMoneyball is no different from many of its genre greats. A lone baseball\ncoach (Brad Pitt) tries to achieve the impossible with his sinking team, whilst\nthose around him think he\u2019s crazy. Heard this somewhere before? Yes, this is\nhow every single sports coach-related sports film\u2019s plotline reads.\nCons: Shown all across America in late September, Moneyball was given\nits wide release a little too early to be considered seriously as a front-runner.\nMost strong pictures are kept in the dark until late November to December.\nWill the voters remember the film in January 2012? Only time will tell.\nYoung Adult\nPros: Jason Reitman is reunited with screenwriter Diablo Cody, and the duo\nwho made the excellent, charming Juno have produced Young Adult. Charlize\nTheron is surprisingly good at pulling off a funny bitch, although an emotional punch towards the end is more than guaranteed with a group as good\nas this.\nCons: Is this too light-hearted for the Academy? Also, comparisons between\nJuno will be the film\u2019s biggest downfall.\nAcademy\nAward\nAnticipation\nThe Film Editors look ahead\nto potential 2012 Oscar Best\nFilm nominations...\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\nPros: Already being hailed as the best British film of the year, Tomas Alfredson\u2019s smart spy thriller is truly one of a kind, with an award-worthy turn from\nthe usually highly underrated Gary Oldman.\nCons: It\u2019s not your usual, explosive spy thriller, but a more slow-burning\none that requires concentration and patience. However, this must be a small\ndrawback for sure.\nCarnage\nPros: All four leads are incredible in their portrayals of such fascinating char-acters. Based on an award-winning play, Roman Polanski recreates this intimate and explosive dramatic feature with confidence and a cracking script.\nCons: Relying on its actors who stay in one apartment throughout the entire\nfilm, there is no denying that this doesn\u2019t quite have the grandeur most Best\nPicture winners have.\n50/50\nPros: An uplifting tale of friendship, love and survival, this tale of a young\nman diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer was a hysterical surprise.\nWritten by a first-time screenwriter, Will Reisner\u2019s screenplay has that clever\nbalance of humour and genuinely heart-wrenching moments.\nCons: It\u2019s pleasant enough viewing, but is it too sugary sweet for the Academy\u2019s tastes?\n\n"

Sure, there\u2019s a whole\nBeijing vs Shanghai thing, but what Beijing has in\nthe way of a distinct and cohesive sound, Shanghai more than makes up for in its DIY ethic.\nAndy Best \u2013 one-time Scouser turned champion of the Shanghai scene and founder of the local Qu record label \u2013 says \u201cIt\u2019s only since I came\nto Shanghai in 2001 that I found a music scene\nI liked again, one based around DIY culture and\nnot sending tapes to A&R men\u201d. But then, as he\nalso points out, \u201cpeople are in it for the love and\nnot the money (there\u2019s no choice)\u201d.\nAlso holding the scene together is Shanghai\u2019s\nmainstay venue, Yuyintang, and a lo-fi, stripped\ndown aesthetic, to which western ears are most\npartial. It\u2019s this that probably first got Pairs noticed by the likes of MTV and BBC Radio\u2019s Tom\nRavenscroft.\nTaking the common line-up of just guitar and\ndrums \u2013 this generation\u2019s power-trio \u2013 drummer Rhys squawk-shouts along to F\u2019s raucous\nand hurried guitar-chord melodies \u2013 fuzzy, happy\nmelodies that bring on a smile like a Sonic Youth\npop song.\nInterviewed by We Live In Beijing, Rhys ex-plained: \u201cOur music just comes from our lack of\ntalent, our inability to play up strokes on the guitar and from our personalities. We tried to write\nsome slower songs, but I think we just got too\nexcited and they sped up overtime. Maybe if we\nhad a metronome we would be a totally different\nband.\u201d\nBut in spite of this they still won Best New\nBand at the 2010 Shanghai Grammys, with one\nof the judges sensibly observing \u201c[Pairs] are a\nlot of noise, but I like their noise, and they make\nsense ... They kind of invaded us during summer,\nand I\u2019m happy they are there\u201d. Andy Best hopes\nthey \u201ckickstart a bunch of similar bands who just\ngo for it and don\u2019t try to be polished genre acts\u201d.\nPairs put out their first, self-titled album with the\nQu label in 2010 and released their second Summer Sweat (2011) themselves. Pairs want you to\nstream both of them from pairs.bandcamp.com.\nLive albums don\u2019t usually make lists like this,\nbut Live at the Cow Palace really deserves a\nspecial mention. Certainly the most musically\naccomplished band on this list, and probably\nthe best rock band ever, The Grateful Dead\nspend around four fifths of this 3-hour-long live\nalbum jamming on stage, and it\u2019s just brilliant.\nBest tracks: \u2018Eyes of the World\u2019\n\u2018Wharf Rat\u2019\nI feel a bit guilty choosing this of all of Bjork\u2019s\nalbums, especially given that Homogenic and\nVespertine are clearly better musically, but\nfor some reason it is nearly always Post that I\nchoose to listen to when I can.\nEveryone knows \u2018It\u2019s Oh So Quiet\u2019, and\nwhile that song has (a few) good qualities, it\nis really everything else that makes this album.\nSplit into two conceptual halves, Post starts off\nfast and angry but ends up in a calm meditative\nstate with the remarkably good trip-hop experiment \u2018Headphones\u2019.\nBest tracks: \u2018Possibly Maybe\u2019\n\u2018Headphones\u2019\nBeth Gibbons of trip-hop royalty Portishead\nhas a voice more suited to creepy folk music\nthan any other singer I\u2019ve come across, which\nis partly why this strange folk-jazz creation\nsounds so great.\nVery autumnal and rural in style, Out Of\nSeason would not be out of place as backing\nmusic to The Wicker Man (the 1973 version,\nobviously).\nNot for fans of the accessible, this is an album of subtlety and terrifying quietness.\nBest tracks: \u2018Mysteries\u2019\n\u2018Sand River\u2019\nCompletely stripped down to the bare bones\nof guitar and voice, Drake\u2019s music has lost both\nthe extravagant accompaniment and veneer of\nnormality which accompanied his previous al-bum.\nHis voice weak and ghostly, his guitar playing pained and purposeful, Pink Moon sounds\nexactly like the musical equivalent of a life\nnearing its end.\nBest tracks: \u2018Harvest Breed\u2019\n\u2018From the Morning\u2019\nUnlike For The Roses, Joni Mitchell\u2019s Blue is\nmusically simple and lyrically clear. Its greatness lies in its openness and authenticity. Effectively an exploration of sadness in all its forms\n(predominantly love and loss) Mitchell sings\ncompletely from her own experience of pain.\nThis album is surprisingly accessible for one\ndealing with such difficult themes. Indeed,\nsongs like \u2018Carey\u2019 and \u2018In California\u2019 have the\nillusion of joy, but, as in Bryter Layter, the music disguises the grim reality of the lyrics.\nBlue frequently tops \u2018Greatest Albums Ever\u2019\npolls and for good reason, it is the best musical\nexpression of depression out there.\nBest tracks: \u2018Blue\u2019\n\u2018A Case of You\u2019\nNo album has ever held my attention for as\nmany repeated listens as this one. In true Newsom style, the five-song album has an average\nsong length of over 11 minutes, with the longest track coming to nearly 17.\nBut enough statistics. Ys features Newsom on\nharp, accompanied by full orchestra. Her impossibly high-pitched voice jumps octaves at\na time to accommodate the complexity of the\nlyrics, while the orchestra swells and sinks to\nfollow her.\nEven after about 100 listens, I still have no\nidea what any of the songs are really about, so\ncryptic are the lyrics. This one album could\ngive a lifetime of listening.\nBest tracks: \u2018Emily\u2019\n\u2018Only Skin\u2019\nAll criticism of Have One On Me focusses on\none thing: this album is long. Very long. It is\na triple album of over 2 hours of completely\nuncategorisable music. It\u2019s easy to understand\nwhy some people are put off.\nBut if you put in the effort and listen to the\nwhole thing, it\u2019s more than rewarding. The first\nthird of the album is the \u201caccessible\u201d bit (but it\nis highly inaccessible by most standards).\nAfter that, Have One On Me is a dense thicket of difficult ambient folk music and verbose\nand obscure lyrics. It took me about 20 listens\nbefore I actually enjoyed the whole album, but\nit really does just get better and better. I strongly recommend you do the same.\nBest tracks: \u2018In California\u2019\n\u2018Go Long\u2019\nIf Hazards of Love was a rock opera, then Hadestown is a folk opera. Unlike the Decembersits\u2019 album, the story here is brilliant. It is a\nreworking of the Greek myth of Orpheus and\nEurydice, except here Hades, no longer the\nGod of the Underworld, owns a mine in goldrush era America.\nFew things can sound more pretentious than\na folk opera about a Greek myth, but, surpris-ingly, Hadestown utterly succeeds without a\nhint of arrogance.\nAccompanied by Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver)\nand a whole host of musicians famous in the\nAmerican folk world, Mitchell\u2019s Hadestown\nreally is essential listening.\nBest tracks: \u2018Wedding Song\u2019\n\u2018Flowers\u2019\nBryter Layter was recorded a few years before\nDrake\u2019s suicide, but Pink Moon was created\neven closer to his death, and you can tell.\nJoanna Newsom\nHave One on Me\nDrag City\n2010\nAna\u00efs Mitchell\nHadestown\nRighteous Babe\n2010\nNick Drake\nPink Moon\nIsland\n1972\nJoni Mitchell\nBlue\nReprise\n1971\nGrateful Dead\nLive at the Cow Palace\nRhino\n1976\nBeth Gibbons &\nRustin Man\nOut of Season\nSanctuary\n2002\nJoanna Newsom\nYs\nDrag City\n2006\nFELIX Friday 04 november 2011 37\nBj\u00f6rk\nPost\nOne Little Indian\n1995\nPunk Planet by\nDouglas Heaven\nThis week: Pairs\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 04 November 2011 29\nARTS\nGreek mythology is normally pretty\nmessed up, but the tale of the Minotaur\ntakes it to a new level. Born after King\nMinos\u2019wife got knocked up by a Bull sent\nfrom the Gods, the half human half beast\nwas locked in a labyrinth and fed on human sacrifice. This reign of terror ended\nwhen Theseus killed the beast with the\nhelp ofAriane, who he then left marooned\non an island whilst buggering off with her\nsister, and consequently caused his father\nto accidentally commit suicide.\nThis tale of woe has provided the ideal\ncornerstone to a new, experimental, exhibition for the Lazarides art group in\ncombination with Pret A Diner. Set in\nthe vaults of the Old Vic Tunnels beneath\nWaterloo station, the idea is to merge the\nworld of art with that of fine dining to\ncreate a unique all encompassing experience under the theme of the Minotaur\nmyth. However, if you\u2019re a student and\nyour budget doesn\u2019t really stretch to Michelin Star food, the exhibition is fully\naccessible minus the meal.\nEven before entering the, the mood\nwas already well set. Upon approach, the\nonly clue to its whereabouts is a solitary\nsign pointing towards a non-descript door\ncovered in graffit, hidden in a back alley.\nInside, you are given a map, and proceed\nthrough a black curtain to enter the first\nroom. The atmosphere within the tunnels\nis incredible \u2013 it feels damp, disused and\neerie, with smoke hanging thick in the air,\nand lighting obscured by rusting metal\nobjects. This is accentuated on the first\npiece that you arrive at: a mess of hanging metal and whirring fans hanging from\nthe ceiling. It\u2019s uncomfortable viewing\nfor reasons you cannot quite fathom.\nThis theme of unease is carried out\nthrough the whole exhibit, where the\nsetting itself acts like a maze of art. It is\nsuch an unusual feeling to walk through\na darkened doorway to be physically\nsurprised at what you encounter. The\nIn the absence of any culinary skills, I\u2019ve\nfound that eating one\u2019s dinner whilst\nwatching MasterChef, can often make\nthe experience a little more palatable.\nThrough years of pretending that my\ntoast was a main of spider crab thermi-dor accompanied with mussels, foraged\nsea vegetables and a side of chips, Gregg\nWallace has hammered into me an appreciation of the infamous notion of \u2018flavour\ncombinations.\u2019\nThis month, Riverside Studios serve\nup two plays that on paper might seem\nto perfectly compliment each other, but\nin truth, would probably raise even Michel Roux\u2019s eyebrows. America\u2019s Deep\nSouth forms the backdrop to both Blind\nDate and 27 Wagons Full of Cotton, the\nformer being a tongue-in-cheek vignette\nthat looks at a teenager\u2019s resistance to her\nprissy aunt\u2019s efforts to find her a date and\nthe latter a somewhat brutal tale of two\nrivals in the cotton industry.\nHorton Foote\u2019s Blind Date lampoons\nthe traditionally strained teenager/par-ent dynamic with a cast of staple characters that are immediately familiar\neven through a Tennessee drawl. Centred around a farcical date between the\nsurly Sarah Nancy and her aunt\u2019s proposed suitor, Felix, we see the tensions\nthat arise when family members\u2019 aspirations for each other don\u2019t wed together.\nDespite a mundane text, the cast breath\nreal comedy into the piece: Sebastian\nKnapp\u2019s delivery of the gawky and\nobtuse Felix opposite the unimpressed\nSarah Nancy sticks in the mind as a\nhighlight. The performances of Francesca Fenech and Louise Templeton, as\nSarah Nancy and aunt Dolores respec-tively, strike a tender balance between\nboth being victim and aggressor.\nAs the evening outside grows darker,\nthe second half inside follows suit. Tennessee Williams\u2019 27 Wagons Full of\nCotton shares the more sombre story of\ncotton mill owner Jake\u2019s sabotage of a\ncompetitor\u2019s mill and the subsequent revenge exacted upon him after his wife\nspills the beans. The emotional tussles\nbetween man, wife and rival form the\nfabric of the piece, typical of Williams\u2019\nbetter-known works, and despite using\nthe same cast in an identical setting, the\nperformance doesn\u2019t suffer from over-similarity. Ross Ericson portrays Jake\nwith a gruff machismo, all the while\nstriking a uncanny resemblance to Andy\nParry (to those who that means anything\nto), and Sebastian Knapp impressively\nmetamorphoses from his pre-interval\nFelix to give a slick performance as the\nslimy Viccaro.\nIt\u2019s clear to see the why at first sight\nthese two plays would make suitable\nbedfellows. Both analyse the damage\nthat springs from a lack of compassion,\nranging from the niggling frictions of\ndaily life seen in Blind Date to the earth-shattering single events that change life\nirreversibly in 27. But the two go about it\nin very different ways. The first has a levity that seems at odds with the grave tone\nof the second, to the degree that you feel a\nnoticeable shift in atmosphere right from\ntion is Stanley Donwood\u2019s corrugated\niron labyrinth, nestled at the centre of\nthe tunnels. Radiohead\u2019s official artist,\nDonwood is the perfect embodiment of\nart at its most uncomfortable, and this\npiece is no different. A twisting and\nturbulent structure that you are forced\nto enter, it embodies claustrophobia,\ndriving you forward through its tightly\nturning tunnels. Combined with blood\nred paint daubed over the posters\nplastered on the walls, and splashes\nof fluids only seen in occasional UV\nlighting, this creates a truly haunting\nexperience, hinting at an unseen terror.\nMinotaur is one of the few times that\nI\u2019ve found the location has proven as\ninteresting as the art itself, in some\ncases possibly overshadowing the\nmore contemporary pieces, such as\nthe work on the perfect form and ge-netics. It also could be said that whilst\nthe idea of combining the experience\nwith a restaurant was novel, it could\nalso prove to be distracting: drunk and\nlaughing guests remove some of the\nintended oppressive atmosphere. However, these are small detractions from\nan exhibit that truly sets itself in an entirely different league to most galleries.\nThe Minotaur has since finished at\nthe Old Vic Tunnels\nMinotaur de force\nWill Prince\nChristopher Dean\nRiverside Studios serve up a slice of the Deep South\nTennessee Williams (and Horton Foote) come to Hammersmith\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect\nembodiment of\nart at its most\nuncomfortable\u201d\nmost shocking examples of this come\nin the form of David Falconer\u2019s incredible sculptures formed from hundreds\nof bodies of rats, or the mournful crucified Minotaur by Atma, covered in\nnails and surrounded by candles.\nHowever, the real heart of the exhibi-Few people know he was actually half-man-half-bull-half-butcher\nCreepy bird thing\nthe start of the second half.

I froze.\nWoah woah woah, hang on a sec (I\nsaid in my head) \u2013 has this been veri-fied? As in, by scientists and stuff?\nWhy had no one warned me?\nWhy had no one seen the huge pile\nof reading material tucked away next\nto the bath and thought: \u2018Egad! This is\nsurely a man whose overly dedicated\ntoilet efforts put him at risk of bum-based discomfort\u2019? And now I\u2019m wor-rying: Is it too late?\nI\u2019ve always read on the toilet and,\nas articles aren\u2019t always short, I don\u2019t\nalways make it out quickly. But to me,\ngoing to the loo without reading material is like brushing my teeth without\npaste. Whilst staying in Dundee\u2019s University halls for a stint, I would sneak-ily stuff The Times down the leg of my\nbaggy joggers when strolling down\nthe corridor to the W.C. I doubt people\nwould have minded all that much, but\nactually getting seen taking the offending (and soon to be offensive) item\nis like that dreaded silence when two\npeople are in adjacent lavatories and\ntry to quietly attend to nature whilst\nwilling their splashes to sound casual\nand un-awkward. You both know that\nyou know, but don\u2019t want to actually\npublicly acknowledge it.\nBut in the comfort of my flat I can\npile away, stacking magazines and\nnewspapers in my lavatorial library.\nAnd you\u2019d be surprised at how many\nhouses I\u2019ve been to that do the same.\nI\u2019ve read all sorts, from Cosmopolitan\nto Muscle and Fitness. I once read Of\nMice and Men whilst on the porcelain\nthrone. It was good.\nBut more than any other type of\npublication, I have re-read, pored over\nand often skimmed through my towering collection of magazines about\nvideo games. Now, before you drop\nthe newspaper in disgust - suddenly\nfeeling that you can\u2019t possibly relate\nto someone so cool he erects pillars\nof gaming literature in his room \u2013 first\nlook at my picture up there and let it\ndawn upon you: it\u2019s difficult to relate\nto someone as attractive as me anyway.\nThe point is that I\u2019ve almost certainly\nread more about gaming than I\u2019ve actually played. It\u2019s partly because I have\nno choice now: I have to keep up to\nspeed on my specialist topic in case I\never get on to Mastermind.\nBut more than that, reading games\nmagazines is a personal pleasure.\nLike a monthly concert of great bands\nplaying new renditions of songs you\nlove. Or for me, a 12-times-a-year fix\nof great writers finding new ways to\npin-down with words the adventures\nplayed through my fingers.\nIt\u2019s why I used to eagerly anticipate\nevery new issue of N64 magazine, and\nwas part-raised on its diet of oddball\nhumour and passionate writing. Now I\nplay much less but still look forward\nto the new issue of Edge magazine (for\nthe discerning gamer), and throughout\nlast week I excitedly told several uninterested people why it was so amazing\nthat the new Zelda game got given a\nfabled Edge [10].\nThey didn\u2019t understand, really. And\nprobably wouldn\u2019t understand why I\nsupplemented my childhood explorations around Birmingham with adventures in Hyrule to save a pixelated prin-cess. They wouldn\u2019t really understand\nwhy every time a new Zelda game\ncame out I\u2019d fish out old issues of N64,\nNGC and Edge magazine to re-read\ntheir pieces on old Zelda games, to remember through print what I\u2019d forgotten in memory.\nAnd now? My mental bank bursting\nat the seams with magazine-sentences,\ntethered to my experience as much as\nany game characters or stories. Like\nwhen Edge gave the stunning Half-Life\n2 [10], saying that its developer Valve\nhad \u2018hit the high note no other developer could reach\u2019.\nI\u2019ve read that sentence many times\nin the loo, because magazines aren\u2019t\nlike web-pages. They don\u2019t disappear with a click or float pristine on a\nscreen. They lose their crispness, and\nbecome well-thumbed. They crinkle,\ncrease and crumple. But importantly\nthey remain, piled up with pride at being complete and self-contained. They\naren\u2019t tied to the infinity of clickable\nchoices on the internet, but lay out their\nchoice wares on their pages for you to\nperuse and dip into; tempting you with\narticles you\u2019d never bother clicking\non whilst browsing the internet. But\nunlike newspapers (bar the illustrious\nFelix of course) they are not one-day-Avoid haemorrhoids... and\nmake magazines\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\nOne of the many rejected proposals\nfor Imperial College\u2019s new motto\nFive months on from the Summer Ball, the\nwounds of such a financial loss are still\nfresh to see. Despite an official \u2018debrief\u2019\nfrom Deputy President (Finance & Services)\nMichael Foster taking place at Monday\u2019s\nUnion Council meeting, areas of ambiguity\nstill remain as to the exact loss that the Ball\nmade, and how such a loss may be avoided\nin the future. It is for these reasons that\nFelix supports an independent inquiry into\nthe Summer Ball, as passed by Council on\nMonday.\nThe passed proposal to launch such an\ninquiry made mention of the belief that\n\u2018Felix should always strive to provide accurate information\u2019, alongside the claim\nthat Felix reported incorrect information.\nFelix would like to clarify that, throughout\nits reporting of the Summer Ball over the\nsummer months, we did indeed strive to\nprovide students with the correct informa-tion, and used information entirely provided\nby the Union which has since transpired to\nbe incorrect. It has also recently come to\nlight that the full financial report detailing\nthe losses has still not been presented to\neither the Union President or the Union\u2019s\nTrustee Board.\nIf the Union itself has not made available\nthe full figures to its own Trustee Board (the\ngoverning body and most powerful committee of Imperial College Union) even after a\n\u2018debrief\u2019, then an independent inquiry must\nindeed be welcomed despite any protestations that Union officers may have. In the\nfive months since the event itself, surely\nthere must have been official figures pro-duced, especially in the face of such a loss?\nIt is not enough to simply state that an\nattendance of three times as many people\nwas \u2018expected\u2019, nor that a resulting over\nexaggerated budget was the reason behind\na (as yet undetermined) loss. Opinions are\nvaluable, but when it comes to a situation\ndealing in financial viability, facts and figures are just as, if not more, important.\nIt must be in the best interest of everybody\nconcerned to see more concrete figures in\norder to determine what went wrong, from\nthose in charge of organising next year\u2019s\nSummer Ball (if it is indeed to be continued\nin its current form) to the students them-selves. The Union must be open to full and\nfrank criticism from the student body when\nit makes mistakes, especially mistakes in\nthe region of \u00a3100,000.

    "content": "GAMES\nFelix Issue 1500: 2011\nSimon Worthington\nThe landscape of gaming has changed a lot since\nthe good old days of the Nintendo 64 and the original PlayStation. Gaming is more popular now than\nits ever been, with the concept of someone defining\nthemself as a \u201cgamer\u201d becoming as superfluous as\npeople who likes books calling themselves \u201creaders\u201d. Through the numerous inventions and innovations to gaming technology that pervade the current generation of consoles and games, the medium\nof video games has been opened up to more people\nthan ever thought possible.\nOne movement that the 2000\u2019s will probably be\nremembered for is the rise of the casual gamer.\nThe start of the decade saw web games become\nthe procrastination activity of choice for many,\nand the world was shocked and awed by quite how\naddictive virtual cricket with stickmen could be.\nBy the end of the Noughties, with every man and\nhis dog having a Facebook profile, it was only a\nmatter of time before Facebook games got your\nmum ploughing virtual fields on her virtual farm\nand your gran serving virtual food in her virtual\nrestaurant. But, like cannabis eventually leads to\ncocaine, casual games eventually get less and less\ncasual until suddenly your mum is screaming down\nthe microphone whilst playing Call of Duty. Casual\ngames, as well as providing genuine merriment for\ngamers and non-gamers alike, also serve to introduce people to the medium of gaming.\nGame developers are always in search of new\nways of providing a fresh gaming experience, and\nat the bleeding edge of gaming technology lies 3D.\nCinemas have been pushing 3D as the next big thing\nfor many years, but with the advent of 3D televisions,\nthe prospect of the technology being shoehorned into\ngames is finally something being considered. Some\ngames like Killzone 3 have been the first to feature\n3D graphics support, and the recently released Nintendo 3DS is famously the first handheld console to\nsupport glasses-free 3D. If the new technology can\nreally improve anything is a dubious issue, but as\ncorporations seem insistent on persuading us to hand\nover more money to upgrade our kit, it looks like for\nthe immediate future 3D is here to stay.\nAnother innovation that is very much in its infancy is the \u201cgaming-as-a-service\u201d model, which\nyou might more readily recognise as \u201cOnLive\u201d.\nThis service, which is the first of its kind to experience a mainstream release, takes the game out of\nyour computer and onto the Internet. It\u2019s the gaming equivalent of robotic surgery \u2013 all the keyboard\nbuttons you press or mouse movements you make\n(or even analogue sticks you rotate \u2013 OnLive is\navailable as a stand-alone console) are sent to OnIn the far future the feature I'm looking forward\nto the most is virtual reality, but there are still lots\nof improvements I can't wait to see in the next 15\nyears or so.\nFirstly, as computers get more like mobiles and\nmobiles get more like computers, we\u2019ll start to see\nthe blurring of the boundary between the mobile\nand PC gaming as well. Soon, we\u2019ll be able to\npause our PC game, pick up our mobile tablet and\ncontinue playing the same game on the move. With\nservices like OnLive pioneering in this area it won't\nbe too long before this idea becomes a reality.\nSpeaking of reality, improvements in 3D detection algorithms and hardware will bring about\nthe latest generation of augmented reality games.\nThey\u2019ll do much more than just fill a space with a\nbox, they'll be able to understand the 3D environment they are in and interact with it in novel ways.\nThere is actually research being carried out at Imperial that is investigating this very area, and hopefully it will lead to games that use the environment\naround the player much more. Imagine CounterStrike played throughout your house!\nMore Imperial research is also helping to push\nforward what is possible for character interaction in\ngames.As computers better understand our meaning\nand emotions so too will the way we interact with\nstories and people in video games. Soon, we won\u2019t\nbe pushing buttons to choose pre-scripted conversation options but we\u2019ll instead be conversing with\ncharacters naturally through speech and facial ex-pression, as if we were having a real conversation.\nAll this helps to make games more immersive,\nand while we are a long way off from virtual reality and total immersion, it looks like the boundaries\nof realism will slowly edge towards it over years\nto come!\nFelix Games has changed a lot since its inception.\nWe know this because for our round-up of the year\n2027 we took a look at old issues of the Felix to\nplay a bit of spot the difference.\nBut we soon lost count. The first thing we noticed is how deep into the paper (we know! quaint,\nright?) we had to dig before getting to the games\nsection itself. The second is the talk of using different \u2018consoles\u2019 for different games, akin it seems to\nhaving a different television for different channels.\nBut the most notable difference is that Felix\nGames is pretty much limited to, well, games. As\nin playthings, toys, virtual escapes, button-pow-ered stories or \u2013 in a word \u2013 entertainment.\nHow far we\u2019ve come: nowadays gaming devices\nare an integral part of our modern life, acting as the\nfoundation for learning of every kind. The primary-coloured make-believe of the Guitar Heroes and\nRockbands of old are unthinkable in a world in which\nnearly every child learns to play using digital instruments and its associated training programme (not to\nmention the most inexplicably popular and insufferably annoying mascot of all the government\u2019s Skillset Schemes: Harmony the Hamster). Similarly the\ntongue-in-cheek appraisal of an early Cooking Mama\ngame looks a little na\u00efve now that the Japanese mega-brand is now the international standard for cooking\ntraining, and whose all-speaking-measuring-and-ad-vising digital utensils can now teach everything from\nIndian Curry to Jamaican Chilli Sauce. And we\u2019d\nrather chat to Cooking Mama over Harmony the un-road-killable hamster any day.\nIn a world where jobs are given based on skill-set points from completed Skillset Schemes, where\neven dating matches are made using a comparison\nof compatibility of Personal Interest points, where\nany car can be turned to Sim-mode and replicate\nthe bucking and judders of real racing from the\ncomfort of one\u2019s garage, it is hard to imagine a\ntime when scores and levels, friend-challenges and\ninternational Cooking Mama tournaments were not\npart of the background hum of life.\nIn fact, it was reading through the old issues that\nfirst made us realise that a little something may\nhave been lost along the way. We are not saying\nthat we here at Felix don\u2019t like the ability to go\noutside with our iVisors and learn about the difference between nimbus and cumulus clouds before\ncompeting with our friends at differentiating them,\nor wear the visors in select National Parks where\nwe can experience our own Nintendo-designed\nZelda adventures to find hulking beasts born from\napple\u2019s magnificent glasses. Nor are we even arguing against the more left-field devices such as the\nDelayGasm digital condom which trains unfortunate men to, well, you know (see our anonymously\nwritten import review last week).\nBut reading the old accounts, of curling up with\na pad and playing through games using only our\nsuspension of disbelief, it is hard not to feel some\nnostalgia for this old time of simple escapism. Of using rudimentary graphics and gameplay as a prompt\nfor unlimited, indescribable mental adventures.\nAnd of sometimes not wanting to have our points\ntallied up and our friend\u2019s Skillset Rank compared.\nJust playing for the sake of play, to share stories and\nnot leader boards. Like toys, virtual escapes, button-powered stories or \u2013 in a word \u2013 entertainment.\nHere\u2019s to 2028 folks, and everything games have\nbeen and can be.\nIt\u2019s hard to look at where we came from and try\nto assess where we might be in even a few years\ntime. How impossible something like OnLive\nmight have seemed before the Internet was even a\npossibility makes it hard to guess at what technologies might pop out of nowhere in the next decade.\nDespite this, there seem to be a few things going on\nin the industry that we\u2019ll look back on in years to\ncome as a sign of impending change.\nWhen Felix 2000 comes around, console manufacturers will probably either have finally opened\nup their platforms, or died a death to the likes of\nOnLive. We\u2019re already seeing waves of this \u2013 the\nPlanetSide remake simply isn\u2019t feasible on Xbox\nLIVE thanks to hardware and infrastructure restric-tions, and even things like Portal 2\u2019s free updates\nor CCP\u2019s forthcoming DUST are only just about\npossible on the PlayStation 3 \u2013 and that\u2019s after\nsome pretty major concessions from Sony.\nPlatforms will open up because they have to \u2013\nwith the possible exception of Facebook, the games\nindustry of 2027 will hopefully look a lot more like\nthe PC industry today.

A few years ago such a\nconcept would have been ludicrous, but with more\nand more homes switching to ultra-fast broadband\ngamers can finally experience the highest quality\nof graphics without needing to shell out the GDP\nof a small country on a water-cooled gaming levia-than. OnLive, although still to prove that it can be a\nsuccess, has begun to bring big-budget titles to the\nimpoverished masses.\nThe final revolution of the era has come in the form\nof motion control. The Wii arrived first and brought\nthe movement-capturing WiiMote to the floor, sparking a revolution that tapped into a previously unmined\nseam of new gamers in the form of family gaming.\nThe Wii was the first to really be successful in appealing to kids, young adults and parents simultaneously,\nand so it\u2019s no surprise that every other games console wanted a slice of the action. Now, the market is\nlittered with motion capture devices of questionable\nquality and use, but their effect of providing a much\nmore intuitive way for gamers to control their games,\nhence making them much more \u201cpick-uppable\u201d for\nthe casual gamer, is clear.\nIn moving into the current generation, games\nhave stopped being just the domain of spotty nerds\nin the basement and have moved into the living\nroom with all the cool and fashionable people.\nThe whole concept of the casual gamer is something new with this generation, and there have been\nplenty of innovations that have fuelled their rise as\na viable market. Now that they finally have a mainstream audience, games have been accepted as big\nbudget entertainment \u2013 gaming is becoming, albeit\nslowly, as common as visiting the cinema or going\nto the football.\nFelix Issue 2000: 2027\nMichael Cook\nopment, flexible pricing models and better connections between developers and players.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nFELIX\n14\nTips & Hacks\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 november 2011\nIBM simulates cat cortex\nBe.ez LE Reporter\nEngineering tomorrow\u2019s humanity\nE\nvery week in here at Technology,\nwe try and peek a few weeks into\nthe future, to tell you what might\nbe the best new technology of the\ncoming season or the device that\nyou\u2019re going to be saving up for. The far future is often best left to science fiction; technological predictions about the future have a\nhairy way of coming back to bite you.\nDespite this, looking into the future offers\na tantalising glimpse into the world that we\nwould like to see. More than ever, science is\npushing the boundaries of what we thought\nwas achievable \u2013 our relationship with the\ndevices we have built grows ever more sym-biotic, and rudimentary though the technology may be, electronics and biology can now\ncommunicate with each other. It\u2019s this combination of factors that\u2019s leading to a growing\ndiscussion of the concept of an \u2018augmented\nhumanity\u2019, a Deus Ex-eqsue combination of\nthe benefits of human creative thought and\nraw mechanical power. Exciting and scary,\ndefinitely. Yet how real is this vision, and\nwhere are we on the road towards it? More\nimportantly, what sort of implications does it\nhave for us as a species? Finally, will Felix\n3000 be written by cyborgs?\nEngineering our bodies\nA cornerstone of this symbiosis will lie in bio-engineering: getting computers to work seam-lessly with our intelligence. This would mean\nthat the distinction between man growing ever\nmore blurry, our dependence on them and their\ndependence on us making any differentiation\npointless. Considering how much electronics\ndrive our everyday lives even today, it\u2019s hard\nnot to see this happening.\nDespite this, we still see computers around\nus as disparate objects, subordinates regardless of our keen dependence on them to maintain our living standards. Bioengineering\nmight change that dynamic, should its current\nbreakneck rate of progress continue (bioengi-neering research is currently one of the fastest\ngrowing scientific fields, with CNN ranking it\nthe number one field for job growth in the next\nten years). One key focus of bioengineering\nresearch revolves around human biological\nenhancement and brain-computer interfacing,\ntwo topics that were until recently the preserve of science fiction.\nBrain-computer interfacing is defined as a\ndirect pathway between the brain and an external device (using invasive surgery, MRI\nor EEG). Given the complexity of the work\nthey carry out, the progress made by bioengineering labs over the last twenty years is truly\namazing. Cochlear implants (a surgically implanted device that can give a sense of sound\nto the profoundly deaf) have a history almost\nas old as the field, and have shrunk from being\nbulky, painful and risky to being \u2018totally implantable\u2019 devices that interact with the brain\nwithout the help of any external interface.\nIn addition, work being done on replacement prostheses for those who have lost limbs\nhas garnered a lot of attention in the media\ndue to the remarkable dexterity that they offer wearers; those who have lost entire hands\nare suddenly able to manipulate individual bionic fingers simply by the power of thought.\nMaking this work is a complicated dance of\nthe sciences \u2013 materials that have to be lightweight and durable, electronics that have to\nbe miniaturised without losing reliability and\ncomplex machine learning algorithms that\nhave to work on a processor that\u2019s probably\nyour mobile phone\u2019s poorer cousin.\nFrom the lab to our hands\nMoving from the current state of affairs to the\nimagined state of singularity of man and ma-chine, however, means taking these devices to\nan entirely new level of functionality. Most of\ntoday\u2019s implants are rough around the edges\nand largely dependent on bulky external power sources. A truly augmented humanity is a\nlong way away \u2013 where will we be in 50 years\ntime? If current research is any indication, not\ntoo far away from the vision. Recently, a study\nby Berkeley researchers showed that patterns\ngenerated by monitoring brain activity of people watching videos could be used to create\na fairly accurate reconstruction of what they\nwere watching (think dream-recording). The\npotential for this technology, when improved,\nis massive. Storing your thoughts right from\nsource could prove the best dictaphone imag-inable, and could allow us to tap into and\ntransfer images from the most realistic cameras we have: our eyes.\nFrom the intangible back to the firmly phys-ical, further research in materials and optimi-zations to existing prosthetics is slowly bringing us commercial \u2018exoskeletons\u2019, mechanical\nframeworks that can be worn over the body\nand provide incredible amounts of extra pow-er, essentially an Iron Man suit for the real\nworld. First practical trials of these skeletons\nin the American military are expected in 5-10\nyears. 50 years will probably see these devices coming out for the mass-market, helping\nus with everyday lifting, moving and general\nendurance.\nLooking towards the past is always a fairly\ngood indicator of what we can expect from the\nfuture. 50 years ago saw the first prototype\nof what we would come to call the internet\nand the first demonstration of the computer\nmouse. This decade has seen the first practical\ndemonstrations of brain-computer interfaces\nand mightily powerful prosthetics that can extend the reach and power of both the human\nmind and the body. Most predictions expect\nsingularity in the 21st century, and this doesn\u2019t\nseem too idealistic. If you are still in doubt,\ntake a look at the world around you. In a world\nwhere we have to debate whether a disabled\nrunner with a prosthetic leg has too much of\nan advantage over able-bodied sprinters, the\nboundaries between man and machine are far\nsmaller than you would imagine. Felix 3000\nwon\u2019t see the rise of the machines, but it will\nprobably see us forgetting that we feared them\nin the first place.\nResearchers at IBM\u2019s Amalden Research Center\nin California have managed to simulate elements\nof biological cognition on a scale that exceeds a\ncat cortex, a step which they claim will mark \u2018the\ndawn of a new era in the scale of cortical simulations\u2019. The work, which was carried out on a\nstate-of-the-art Blue Gene supercomputer sporting 147,456 processors and 144TB of memory,\nonly a few orders of magnitude away from the\nscope of a human cortex. This doesn\u2019t mean that\nIBM is only a few years away from simulating a\nhuman brain, however \u2013 while the simulation will\nprovide an excellent insight into the dependence\nbetween various elements of the brain, it is still\nnowhere close to simulating the interactions between them. That is not to take anything away\nfrom the efforts of the scientists, however, as the\nresearch should provide a novel way for neuroscientists to study the brain from its building blocks.\nThe Be.ez LE Reporter is a sturdy little waterproof\nbag, with a robust feel to it. The bag contains a decent assortment of pockets in both the main compartment and the front section to hold your peripherals and papers, and is padded well to shield them\nfrom any knocks. Despite the waterproofing, the bag\ndoesn\u2019t zip shut, so you might want to be careful in\nheavy rain - it\u2019s not exactly designed for the rainforest holiday you may have had in mind. Coming in two\ncolours (the black/orange combo pictured above or\ngrWey/blue) the bag isn\u2019t exactly a great looker but\nnot too much of a slouch either. Priced at circa \u00a357\non Amazon, it\u2019s a bit more expensive than your average laptop carrier case.\nFeroz Salam on the interdependence of man and machine\nOnly slightly colder than the average cat\n\n"

The\npaper cited incomplete information regarding\nthe loss and the need for an \u201cindependent opinion\u201d.

This year\nRight to Play was chosen as the main nominated\ncharity following an intense deliberation period from\nthe RAG committee. Several other supporting charities were chosen, including Barnardo\u2019s, the Royal\nBritish Legion and the Mines Advisory Group.\nRight to Play operates in the developing world, using sport and play to help and teach children important life lessons, such as using a stuck-in-the-mud\nstyle game to educate about Malaria prevention.\nTheir approach is as much about having fun as\ngetting a serious message across. It has been\nsupported by a number of major corporations and\nmovements, such as BUCS (British University and\nCollege Sport, the league in which we cream UCL\non a weekly basis) and the College itself, with Sport\nImperial working in a partnership with them over the\nlast few years.\nThe first event to be run this year was the bike\nauction on Monday lunchtime (with a repair expert\nin attendance so any niggling problems could be\nfixed).\nIt\u2019s both an excellent and worthy cause that we at\nImperial and RAG can only hope to do our best for,\nand here\u2019s to a great year full of fun events, incredible amounts raised and us all doing the best we\ncan for them.\nJack Hewitt \u2013 RAG Chair\nNavid Nabijou\nSummer Ball Debrief\nJonathan Peek\nAlcohol Policy passed\nHonorary Life Membership\nSerious issues about the planning of last year\u2019s\nSummer Ball, which made a loss of over \u00a3100\n000, were raised at this Monday\u2019s meeting of\nthe Union Council. In his Summer Ball 2011\nDebrief, requested by last year\u2019s council, current Deputy President (Finance and Services)\n(DPFS) Michael Foster outlined how he believes\nthat the \u201cmain reason for the large loss incurred\n... was a wholly unrealistic prediction of attendance.\u201d\nDespite a steady drop in turnout over previous years \u201cthe budget predicted an attendance\nof almost 4000 students ... more than double\n[what was achieved] in any of the previous\nthree years\u201d. In Foster\u2019s mind, such an overestimate was \u201cirresponsible\u201d. The main reason\nfor this inflated estimate were the changes to\nthe Ball, in particular inviting students from\nGoldsmiths\u2019 and King\u2019s to attend, adding the\nPrince\u2019s Gardens Stage and starting the acts\nearlier. It was hoped that the last of these\nchanges would attract more Life Sciences\nstudents, who might otherwise not have been\nable to attend as a result of having exams in\nthe same period.\nIt was pointed out from the Council floor,\nhowever, that advertising at the other institutions was not as good as it could have been.\nFoster\u2019s report also admitted that, according\nto the post-Ball survey, \u201cmany people weren\u2019t\nhappy with the change in format to what was\nseen as a festival\u201d. The report did, however,\nexplain that that the formal dinner was axed\nbecause attendance \u201chad fallen from 650 in\n2007 to 150 in 2010\u201d and that \u201cthe black tie\ndress code was removed, as it was thought to\nbe unreasonable to expect students to stay in\nformal dress from noon to midnight\u201d.\nFoster rejected \u201cthe claim from last year\u2019s\nCouncil saying there was not enough transparency and consultation\u201d on these changes. He\nreminded those present that all format changes\nwere approved by \u201cthe Summer Ball working\ngroup\u201d formed of the elected Ents Committee; that the Council was kept up to date with\nthe progress in the Ball\u2019s preparations; and\nthat the budget was approved by the Executive Committee. Issues were raised from the\nfloor, however, over how much influence the\nCouncil had on the Ball, given that it was only\ndealt with in last year\u2019s DPFS\u2019 regular reports\nrather than a separate paper. Heather Jones, last\nyear\u2019s Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)\nand current CAG Chair, also pointed out that\nby the time the budget was presented to the ExDeputy President (Finance & Services) Michael\nFoster presented a paper regarding the much debated responsible retailing of alcohol.\nThe paper outlined a procedural policy to\nbe used in the bars as guidelines for retailing\nalcohol. It includes the banning of initiation\nceremonies and \u201cdirty pints\u201d as reported on\npreviously by Felix. Amendments were proposed by Henry Abbot, ACC Chair, to change\na variety of points including one regarding the\nmobile bar, frequently used on the second floor\nof the union for clubs, limiting it to diluting\nspirits containing an alcohol content above\n38% which were sold. The council members\nvoted on the proposed amendments one by one\nand the paper was eventually passed.\nThe original policy outlined a limit of free\ndrinks available as part of ticket costs to be six\nto eight. An amendment was to define it as the\nupper limit of eight specifically. Although this\npassed, it was noted that the change had already been made and that the policy for which\nit was proposed was an outdated document.\nCouncil imposed a fifteen minute guillotine for\nthe discussions regarding this paper, and minor\nissues arose when a discrepancy in the law was\nbrought up regarding the downing limit and\nthe yard glass, a traditional piece of English\nheritage. Much of the discussion, however,\nwas focused around the use of Imperial ID\ncards to identify those under 18 who shouldn\u2019t\nbe sold drinks.\nThe members conferred on a point which\nsought to allow students with a red box on\ntheir ID card (indicating they were seventeen\nOne of the most hotly debate issues was that\nof Honorary Life Memberships (HLMs).\nThese lifetime memberships of the Union are\ntraditionally awarded to Sabbatical Officers\nat the end of their terms in office. Last sum-mer, however, Union Council narrowly voted\nagainst awarding HLM to the then Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services), Ravi Pall.\nThis decision was later quashed, on the\ngrounds that the Sabbatical Officers had been\n\u2013 unconstitutionally \u2013 barred from taking part\nin the vote (although this is a longstanding\nconvention).\nThis Monday the vote was taken again;\nnone of the now former Sabbatical Officers\nwere present during the discussion. The vote\nitself was carried out by secret ballot, meaning that a two-thirds majority was required in\neach case.\nThe decision was the same as that of last\nyear, with Council deciding against awarding\nHLM to the former DPFS (with 12 votes for\nversus 14 against). Much of the debate centred on the handling of the Summer Ball, as\nwell as more general issues concerning Pall\u2019s\nhandling of his role.

The decision was made, of course, in the interests of\neconomy, but this will in fact be small, since another person will\nhave to be employed to take over his duties \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d,\nsuch as store-keeping.\nHe was the person whom people usually cited when they criticised\nthe Refectory for being overstaffed, apparently believing that he did\nnothing but stand and look like a butler.\nIn pandering to these critics, and to achieve what is really a trifling\neconomy, the Committee have lost us the services of one who, at\nthe least, lent an air of dignity to the Dining Hall and provided one\nof the differences between Imperial College and other less august\ncolleges.\nWe must not, however, be unfair to the Committee, for although\nthere are many who will feel a pang of regret that Mr. Sellars has\nbeen sacrificed, at least it shows that the Committee are prepared\nto take any steps that may be necessary to put its finances in order.\n50S\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE IS TO HAVE ITS OWN IBM 7090 COMPUTER, TO\nBE INSTALLED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,\nAND TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL BY THE END OF THE YEAR.\nThis was announced by the Rector, Sir Patrick Linstead, at a joint\nPress Conference with Mr. T. C. Hudson (Managing Director of IBM\n(UK) Ltd. ), on Wednesday, last week. The unit which would cost on\nthe open market about one million pounds, is to be made available\nto the College free of charge with a further grant of \u00a318,000 a year\nfor five years. This grant will be used to create fellowships and generally to support the work being done at the centre.\n60S\nThe lavatory/shower/bathroom complexes in the first floor of newly\nintegrated Beit Hall, New Hostel are unsure of their identity.

However due to a technical\noversight, or an impish sense of humour, the female diagram is\nstuck over the word MEN and vice versa.

My point is that things are indeed looking bleak, which has forced sun worshippers and classier party-goers to be a little\nmore creative. Perhaps India\u2019s western coast is\nthe answer we\u2019ve all been searching for.\nGoa is hardly a new global hotspot \u2013 it\u2019s been\na safe haven for holidaymakers and hippies for\ndecades \u2013 but I can\u2019t help but think that we\u2019re\nnot exploiting it to its full potential. Having\nspent two months getting myself covered in\ndust on the temple trail, I decided it would be\nthe ideal ultimate spot before returning for a another dreaded term in the smog. So if it\u2019s a mixture of vibrant culture, culinary delights and\nsleepless nights you\u2019re after, look no further.\nAn inviting Goan home\nAs the saying goes, there\u2019s nothing like being\ninvited into a Goan home. But of course, sifting\nthrough the endless locations can be tiring, so\nI\u2019ve done the trial and error for you. The LaLiT\nGolf & Spa Resort in South Goa is nothing less\nthan perfection, and my stay there was what really made this leg of my trip so enjoyable and\nmemorable. The rooms are immaculate, the\nstaff provides outstanding hospitality (hence\ntheir slogan \u2018limitless hospitality\u2019), and the facilities on offer will keep you entertained for\neons.\nAn added bonus is that the resort also caters\nfor groups: for rates in the range of a dingy London hotel it\u2019s possible to book out swanky, self-sufficient villas, complete with kitchens, swimming pools, hot tubs, and your own personal\nGoan master chef. To me the villas just scream\n\u2018perfect post-exam getaway\u2019 \u2013 what better way\nto celebrate than with endless cocktails with\nfriends under a scorching eastern sun?\nAs with any holiday, the food served is para-mount. The LaLiT chefs will not disappoint,\nand they served up some of the best Indian food\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure of eating. Over the course\nof my stay the chefs got to know my palette,\nand consistently managed to craft dishes that\nkept my taste buds craving more. Appalled by\nmy culinary ignorance, one of the master chefs\neven gave me some private tuition in Indian\nfare \u2013 the cooking class was fantastic, though\nI\u2019m yet to replicate the results.\nSo for all of the reasons above and below,\nThe LaLiT Golf & Spa Resort should be your\nGoan home of choice. But it\u2019s not just the hotel\nand staff that make the stay an awesome expe-rience: the other guests were lovely and great\nto interact with. One group invited me to their\nwedding reception, where I enjoyed poolside\nshisha and drinks while listening to some ambient tunes.\nWishing You Were Here\nVibrant culture, endless activities and unrivalled coastline: Ch\nGallivanting the golde\n\u2018Machu Picchu\u2019 by George Roberts\nGet out and see the state\nWhen it comes to fine golden beaches, you could\nreally be anywhere in the world. Goa is a lot\nmore appetising when you look at it as a state\nrather than a coastline: there\u2019s nothing quite like\nIndian culture, and the activities on offer in Goa\ncater to everyone\u2019s tastes.\nThe south, where The LaLiT Golf & Spa Resort is located, is a lot less developed than the\nnorth: staying down south is much more sooth-ing, and the most bustling north is easily accessible by car or bike within an hour. Unfortunately my tight schedule only allowed for a day of\nwhizzing through the northern sites, but there\u2019s\nplenty to keep you entertained.\nInstantly noticeable is the Portuguese influence on the state, particularly obvious in cities\nlike Margao with the abundance of charming ar-chitecture. There\u2019s plenty of churches, like the\nBas\u00edlica do Bom Jesus, countless brilliant muse-ums, wildlife sanctuaries, and, of course, golden\nbeaches. Every Wednesday in Anjuna is a vibrant flea market, where you can pick up anything from handmade jewellery to hammocks!\nAnd when all is seen and done, you\u2019ll always\nfind good food on standby. The Portugueseinfluenced fare isn\u2019t an offensive assault on the\nsenses, more addictive coastal delights with a\nhint of the east, unlike some of the more brutal curries you\u2019re sure to encounter. Of course\nif you\u2019re feeling brave, go all out and order a\nVindaloo (a Goan classic), but know that you\u2019ve\nbeen warned.\n#1. Revel in the eastern sun as you zip up the be\n#3. Relax and unwind with a feni at Corta\u2019s beac\nGet there: Boris Bike (\u2018cause it\u2019s faster)\nSee: Endless cocktail and blues bars\nEat: Mezze to share at Yalla Yalla\nCost: \u00a35 \u2013 \u00a315 for nibbles for 2\nHop away from Piccadilly\u2019s tourist-filled pavements\nand delve into the side streets of Soho. You\u2019ll be\npleasantly surprised by the swanky bars offering free music all nights of the week (see: Ain\u2019t\nNothin\u2019 But), cheap and delicious eateries, and a\nresident B@1 (formerly the Red Lion pub, Marx\u2019s\nold hangout) that trumps its lousy Hammersmith\ncounterpart.\nTravel on your doorstep\n\n"

From humble beginnings the page\nemerged in September 2005 under the editorship of Rupert Neate. For the first issue of the academic year,\na fearless member of \u2018Imperial\u2019s number one band\u2019 (at the time) ventured onto Queen\u2019s Lawn rocking nothing but a guitar, all in the name of Jazz and Rock Society. These brave heroics paved the way for countless\nindividuals and societies to strut their stuff in the name of self-promotion and charity. Page 3 continued for\nthe following four issues, until it was moved to the centre of the paper. Following that, the page has more or\nless continued in the centre constantly, evolving into what we now lovingly call Centrefolds.\nObviously, this whole exercise wasn\u2019t an excuse to trawl through the archives in search of our favourite\ncentrefolds.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 04 november 2011 13\nTECHNOLOGY\nDouglas Heaven sees programmable cells, not silicon chips\ncessors. But perhaps strangest of all\nis the future envisioned by the fledgling field of computational biology,\nwhich aims to make computational\ndevices out of living cells.\nStudying how cells process information could help with understanding life itself. Last year, the genome\nentrepreneur, Craig Venter, famously\nmade the first synthetic cell by copying the genetic code of one species\nof bacteria and inserting it into another \u2013 prompting many questions,\nquite literally, about the meaning of\nlife. However, swapping around an\nexisting DNA sequence \u2013 or biological\nprogram \u2013 only goes so far. What if we\nwere to specify arbitrary functionality\nfor cells \u2013 or, in other words, write our\nown biological programs?\nThat\u2019s just what ex-Imperial student Andrew Phillips is working on.\nPhillips, who now heads the Biological Computation group at Microsoft\nResearch Cambridge, was recently\nnamed one of the world\u2019s top innovators under the age of 35 by Technology Review for his research into\nprogramming biology. Typically, synthetic biology involves low-level tinkering and the manipulation of DNA\nstrands directly. By developing a programming language that compiles to\nDNA sequences instead of machine\ncode, Phillips allows cell behaviour to be specified at a high level\nof abstraction, making it easier to\ndesign biological programs from\nscratch.\nAccording to Phillips, through\ncollaboration with experts in programming languages, biologists,\nneuroscientists, and even ecolo-gists, his group at Microsoft Research has \u201cthe scope to research\nand develop what might become\nthe key technologies of the next\ndecade or the decade after that.\nIt\u2019s possible that programming\nbiology may one day surpass the\nworld of programming silicon\u201d.\nThere\u2019s a lot of speculation about\nwhere the future of computing lies.\nQuantum computers and qubits\npromise to open up computational\nproblems that are unfeasable using bits alone; nanotech materials\nsuch as graphene look set to change\nthe fundamentals of computer hard-ware, replacing silicon as the basis for\nchip design; and electrons might give\nway to photons as we strive for higher\nspeeds and bandwidth via optical pro-Smartphones must improve, says Abhimanyu Chugh\nIs this what we\u2019ll be coding for in the future?\nHave you ever had your phone\ndie when you least expected it?\nHave you ever forgotten to charge\nyour phone the night before only\nto find out later you forgot to take\nyour charger with you? Or realised you can\u2019t use your phone\nfor its primary purpose after too\nmuch Angry Birds or surfing on\nthe tube? I know I have. This is\none thing that I really hope smartphones overcome in the future.\nPersonally, I am tired of having\nto charge my phone every night,\nsometimes even multiple times\nin a day. It\u2019s about time we saw\nsome innovation in the battery\ndepartment.\nAnother feature I would love to see\nin future smartphones is seamless\nintegration with other technology.\nThe devices should follow same\ninternational standards across all\nplatforms, not their own proprietary\nrubbish. This has the benefit of multiple devices cooperating effortlessly with the touch of a few buttons,\nwithout worrying about compatibility.\nAdditionally, smartphones could\nimprove on their form factor. It\u2019s difficult to find a phone that truly suits\nyou, or one that adapts to user\u2019s\nneeds. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to have\na foldable smartphone, which can\nbe expanded for a perfect browsing experience or compacted to facilitate calling, a smartphone/tablet\nhybrid? Perhaps even a hidden keyboard to make typing even easier,\nwithout having to use the on-screen\nkeyboard and having your messages\nautocorrected to the point where\nthey make no sense?\nFinally, the possibility of waterproof smartphones is something\nI\u2019m sure we could all appreciate.\nHaving experienced the porosity of\nsmartphones first hand, I know the\nanguish that follows the constant\nfailed attempts at reviving your precious phone.\nOne technology that always\nseems so tantalisingly close and\nyet simultaneously so far is virtual reality \u2013 where a computer-gen-erated environment can be walked\naround in and interacted with as if it\nwere real. I\u2019m waiting for one better\nthan that; namely, total immersion.\nThink \u2018The Matrix\u2019 \u2013 people don\u2019t\njust stand in a booth with some\nfunny goggles on, rather the signals\nto their brain are controlled directly\nby the computer to simulate sight,\nsound and the other senses to boot.\nAlthough this may sound like\nsome eyebrow-raising science fic-tion, medical scientists are in fact\nalready getting stuck into to messing with the brain\u2019s electronic sig-nals, in the form of devices known\nas \u201cbrain-computer interfaces\u201d. As\nrecently as last year doctors at Tuebingen University in Germany were\nable to restore the sight of a blind\nman by implanting a vision chip (like\nalmost fully in the virtual one\n(imagine a virtual reality that lets\nyou do what you want whenever\nyou want \u2013 would there be any\npoint living in the real world when\na place like that exists), and what\nthe implications are for privacy\nand mind-control all need to be\nanswered before humanity is\nready for life in a virtual world.\nBut before that happens, total\nimmersion virtual reality should\nbe frickin\u2019 sweet, with video\ngames and computer interfaces\ntaken to their ultimate goal. Call\nof Duty 10: Virtual Warfare, any-one?\nin a digital camera) into his eye and\nfeeding the electric signals directly\ninto his brain. The lucky guy went\nfrom no vision to be able to tell\napart objects at the flick of a switch.\nIt won\u2019t be long before this sort of\n(hopefully less Frankenstein-esque)\ntechnology might be able to provide\nsimulated senses, instead of restoring them.\nBut when it does happen, virtual\nreality raises ethical problems on\na grand scale. Questions about\nwhether it\u2019s wrong to allow computers to simulate pain through these\nmethods, whether it\u2019s okay to give\nup your life in the real world to live\nSimon Worthington thinks virtual reality is the next game-changer\nFolding might be the way forward.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 04 november 2011 21\nGive me Liberty, or give\nme Death!\nWhen the US democracy was in its teens, a french-man, Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859) visited\nthe country. He had been commissioned by the\nJuly Monarchy to examine the prisons in the USA,\nbut his real intentions were to study american society as an example of freedom, equality and de-mocracy. He published his conclusions in one of\nthe most brilliant essays ever written: \u201cDemocracy\nin America\u201d.\nComing from an aristocratic and conservative\nbackground, Tocqueville\u2019s family had suffered during the French Revolution, but rather than persist\nin his feudal attitudes as many of his fellow noblemen had done, Alexis had acknowledged the fading luck of aristocracy. In his magnum opus, Tocqueville argues that the democratisation of society\nwas an inevitable process that had been going on\nfor the last 700 years. However melancholic, he\nembraced the consequences of such a process,\nand took the USA as a case study of how democracy can work.\nOne of the features that struck him most was\nthat of freedom and equality in America. Indeed,\nhe devotes most of his book to explain and analyse the balance that exists between liberty and\nequality; between individuality and community.\nIsaiah Berlin (1909-1997) quite clearly explained\nthis fact: equality and liberty are opposed ideals.\nThe utopia in which both come true at the same\ntime is an intellectual fallacy. For liberty is the un-impeded fulfilment of our true nature, and each of\nus being different in our abilities and aptitudes, it\nfollows that upon letting us free some will prevail\nover others: the strong will overcome the weak;\nthe cunning over idiots. But if equality is to be en-forced, then our liberty will be constrained to ensure no one prevails.\nTocqueville acknowledged this conflict. He saw\nthat equality \u201cimpels the weak to want to bring\nthe strong down to their level, and reduces men to\npreferring equality in servitude to inequality in freedom.\u201d These weaklings would lack of any incentive\nto progress, though. Tocqueville quite clearly saw\nthat inequality was the incentive for the poor to\nbecome rich, and that full equality would lead to a\nRoman decadence and stagnation.\nIndeed, the so-called equality that was practiced\nin the socialist countries during the 20th Century\nshows that individuals with no freedom to follow\ntheir whims, will simply become more and more reliant on what the state can provide, and less so on\ntheir own abilities. In no time, a dormant society\nwill appear, one in which \u201cit becomes difficult for\ncitizens to defend their independence against the\naggressions of power.\u201d Equality leads to tyranny.\nBernhardt Kreuzweg-Burgheim\nAlexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859). What a lad!\nDISCLAIMER: All opinions appearing in this\nissue are ficticious. Any resemblance to real\nopinions, living or dead, is purely coinciden-tal.\nterest of the media in its coverage has led the\nsector towards criticism of the movement. Unable to report progress against a litany of such\nabstract demands as \u201cNot to be shoehorned into\na convinient narrative by defining ourselves\u201d\nand \u201c[To gain] a cultural foothold and evolve\ninto something much bigger\u201d, they disparage\nthe Occupy movement\u2019s lack of definition, inquiring as to the seeming lack of direction or\nagenda, and questioning the future of the 99 per\ncent if they refuse to define themselves more\ntraditionally. Similarly to Baez, they call for a\nfigurehead and for concrete demands.\nSuch sentiments are echoed in Wall St. and the\nCity where this lack of direction is understood\nas representative of an ill-informed community.\n\u201cFinancial services are one of the last things we\ndo in this country and [we] do it well. Let\u2019s embrace it,\u201d says one Wall St. money-manager to\nthe NYTimes. This money-man complains too\nof a lack of comprehension among congress. Of\nSenator Charles E. Schumer he states, \u201cThey\nneed to understand who their constituency is,\u201d\nreferring to the power of funding in influencing\npolitical campaigns.\nThough these protests are directed at bankers,\nthey represent a wider discontent and a growing distrust in politicians and the economy. The\nlinks between money and policy, as Schumer\nwas reminded, may be one of the reasons the\nOccupiers are unwilling to push paper through\nthe houses of parliament and congress. Whether\nor not this movement can survice without following a more classical, more well-defined path\nremains to be seen. First, it will have to survive\nthe cold. Seizing the bout of bad weather as an\nopportunity to prove his dedication to the cause,\nEric, an unemployed carpenter, offers a hand:\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going around tents today trying to\nweatherise them,\u201d he says, abstractly.\nThis weekend Manhattan saw the earliest snowfall since the American Civil War. It fell on the\nJack-o\u2019-lanterns left outside for Halloween,\nover the tents in Zuccotti Park, and, too, on the\nfalling faces of the Occupy Wall Street protes-tors. But the snow in New York, and falling temperatures elsewhere, are not the only threats the\nmovement faces.\nFootage taken with thermal imaging cameras of the camp outside St. Paul\u2019s has shown\na number of unoccupied tents, and there are\nstories, not least from the protesters themselves,\nof abandonment. Robin Smith, a one-time\nConservative counsillor, now part-time Occupier, explained to the Mail \u201cThere are lots of\nmiddle-class people turning up and helping but\nthey have to go back home ... they\u2019ve got jobs\nand a family to keep. I go home every two or\nthree nights to get cleaned up and then return\nto my tent.\u201d Over the pond Chris Goldsten, Occipier of Wall St., told Time Magazine how bad\nweather sends him back to his New Jersey home\nat nights. \u201cI occupied a puddle,\u201d he said.\nWhile protestors have refuted claims that only\none in 10 tents are in use, calling on reports from\nexternal experts that question the accuracy of\nthe technology, such stories, regardless of their\naccuracy, only enhance the widespread perception of a lack of seriousness among Occupiers.\nBehind closed doors bankers dismiss the\nprotesters. \u201cIt\u2019s not a middle-class uprising,\u201d\nthe NYTimes quotes one banker, \u201cIt\u2019s fringe\ngroups. It\u2019s people who have the time to do\nthis\u201d. It is the nature of popular movements to\nbegin at the fringes before taking hold of popular support, but even vocal supporters of past social movements are on the fence with this one.\nIn an interview with The Republican\u2019s Kevin\nO\u2019Hare, Joan Baez, folk singer and participant\nin the civil and human rights movements, as\nwell as the anti-Vietnam war protests, states\n\u201cI\u2019ll be convinced when it develops a real direction ... So far it\u2019s hard to tell\u201d.\nAs Occupy stretches on the increasing disin-Ninochka Vodanoj\nTemperatures plummet in Zuccotti park, and a full-time Occupier warms his hands\nwhile pondering which of the empty tents to inhabit for the night\n\u201cQuand je sens que ma foi dans les forces supr\u00eames faib-lit, je pense toujours au miracle de l\u2019anti-freeze\u201d\nYou there, make way for\nliberty!\nBUSINE$$\n\n"

When\nasked about whether the kit- bags were\nstacked too high in his car, he responded with the words: \u201cI don\u2019t need to see,\nthat\u2019s fine\u201d.\nThe first match against Middlesex\nstarted off steadily for Imperial and the\ngame was evenly poised.Two swift run-outs of \u2018keeper Vishal Nair and token-white-guy Iain Stobbs turned the tide\nagainst IC, but the screw was really\nturned when the Middlesex albino Sikh\noff-spinner went for a miserly fifteen\nruns in his of three overs.

Ably helped by Vishal\nand Navin Surtani, the innings finished on 143 from twelve overs. Once\nagain though, the opposition batting\nwas calm. Despite a caught and bowled\nfrom Navin along with some direct\nhit run- outs from skipper Ahsaan and\nHasit - Euston Tech managed to win in\na tight contest.\nEven though the inexperienced team\nhad been defeated, it gave the newer\nand younger guys a lot of invaluable experience to take forward for next year\u2019s\ntournament.

The deal, which would\nrequire pension cuts and tax rises, is predicted to produce a\nno vote, sending the markets crashing. Germany has made it\nclear that the deal cannot be re-negotiated, as the current one\ntook months of wrangling. Both Angela Merkel and Nicholas\nSarkozy have made it clear to Greece that they must decide by\nmid-December, when the referendum takes place, if they are\ngoing to leave the Eurozone.\nOn Wednesday, the headquarters of\nFrench satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were destroyed in a petrol bomb attack by Islamic extremists. The attack\nwas in retaliation for the magazine using a cartoon of the prophet Muhammad as its cover, and listing him as the\neditor-in-chief. The actual editor, Stephane Charbonnier, has been deeply\ncritical of the inability to question Islam\nin the press. The Prime Minister, Francois Fillon, described the bombing as\nan attack on the freedom of press.\nIsrael\u2019s Prime Minister has said he will increase the building of illegal settlements\nand withhold tax revenue from the Palestinian Authority, after they successfully applied for recognition at UNESCO, the UN\u2019s\nParis-based cultural arm. The Palestinian\napplication followed their unsuccessful\nbid for full membership at the UN- which\nwas vetoed by the United States. They will\nnow be able to apply to have sites such\nas the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem\nclassified as UNESCO world heritage sites.\nThe United States has cut its funding to\nUNESCO following the move. The EU, on\nthe other hand, condemned Israel\u2019s move.\nMost European countries voted in favour of\nPalestinian membership at UNESCO.\nTroops from Kenya have entered Somalia and engaged in bloody battles\nwith Islamic group Harakat al-Shabaab\nal-Mujahideen, who control large parts\nof the south of the country where they\nhave imposed a strict interpretation of\nShariah law.

Well you were\nwrong, thanks to our freind Bruce Chan in the darkest recesses of china we bring you a review of \u201cRug\nMe. All scrum, all the time\u201d. This incrdible movie\nwas shot in 1080P (the capital P is for Penis), and\nwill have you standing at the touchline for a solid 80\nminutes. Hangman has become the sole distrubtor\nin a multi billion penny deal, and will be offering\nyou a DVD free of charge. All readers need to do is\ncollect the smut tokens found in this issue and the\nnext 5. Then after \u00a36.99 for p&p this superb video\ncould be yours. On the right you can see a photo-graphical review that an erudite, honourable young\nman has sent in after we sent him a preview copy\nto gain consumer reaction. Our thoughts exactly.\nBAM!\nHangman\u2019s Finest College News Source\nthe turnip\nUnion drinks\ncontaminated\nwith mysterious\nsubstance\nS\nome 90% of all the beverages consumed on Union premises have been\nfound to contain various quantities of a\nsubstance that is strictly controlled by\nthe Government and outright illegal in\ncertain premises and communities. The chemi-cal, a by-product of the metabolism of microbes\nspoiling liquids with a high sugar content, is\nhighly flammable and a precursor to acetic acid,\nwhich in its concentrated form is corrosive and\nhas a foul odour. When consumed, symptoms\nof mild poisoning include impairment of judgement and inhibitions (including a tendency to\nget naked), increased reaction time and decreased general motor functions (such as the\nunbuttoning of shirts). At higher doses, slurred\nspeech, blurred vision, short-term memory loss\nand vomiting may result, often culminating in\na total loss of consciousness, virginity and/or\ndignity.\nThe anti-inhibitory effect serves to facilitate the further consumption of this dangerous\nchemical, as the victims tend to drink whatever\nis immediately in front of them with disregard\nto the distinctive taste, which would otherwise\nalert one to the drink\u2019s contents. As a diuretic,\nit not only acts to dehydrate but it also causes\nannoyance to those nearby due to the necessity\nof regular toilet breaks. Often, when the victim\nis away, their drink is either spiked or topped\nup, followed by various jibes such as \u201cdown\nit, fresher!\u201d or a penny in the cup upon their\nreturn, worsening their situation. The extent\nof this contamination is severe: a survey concluded that some three-quarters of all students\nat Imperial have reported to have had some or\nall of the symptoms mentioned above, rising to\nalmost 100% among those studying Medicine.\nStudents are advised to be vigilant against\nthis insidious threat by making sure of the\ncontents of their drink before consumption,\nbecause it is reported that Union staff have\nbeen willingly poisoning their customers,\nand preventing them from leaving the premises with their drink in a possible attempt to\navoid arousing the suspicion of the law. It is\nthought that no other establishments are selling\nthis particular poison, meaning students could\nnot obtain it anywhere else, if need be. In a\nstatement to Hangman, a student who cannot\nbe named as their name is a symbol, said: \u201cIt\nwould be downright silly of them to want people to be enticed to go to the Union. It would\nbe stupid for them to then be able to monitor\nthe drinking. I mean, the bar staff could not\npossibly then just do what they already do so\nwell and not serve those that they deem to be\ntoo drunk.\u201d In a reply to this the Union said:\n\u201cWe cannot comment on such matter, as we are\nno longer trying to get elected and therefore\nhave no reason to care\u201d. They then returned to\ntyping up their CVs and pretending people care\nwhat they do and say.\nStep 1: Grab arse Step 2: Orgasm Step 3: Apologise\nInebriated acquaintance of the week\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n62\nSPORT\nFriday 04 november 2011\nEarly BUCS loss for 8-ball\nThe university cue sports season began last\nweekend in dramatic fashion as an inexperienced Imperial College English eight-ball\npool team travelled up to Nottingham for the\ninaugural English Universities Pool Championships. Hosted by the Nottingham University\nSnooker and Pool Club, 25 university teams\nand over 128 individual entrants battled it out\nfor some early bragging rights.\nHowever, the competition was almost over\nfor Imperial before it started. Team member\nMax Chalmers overslept and, along with fellow\nteammate Alex Lambrianos, almost missed the\ntrain, arriving at Kings Cross station only five\nminutes before the departure time.\nThat first minor drama of the weekend was\nnot the only consequence of the early start for\nthe team, with the majority having to wake up\nat 4am on the Saturday. By the time of arrival\nat Rileys, the tournament venue, tiredness was\nalready creeping in and four of the five team\nmembers were immediately knocked out of\nthe Individual Championships. Only team\ncaptain, Elwin Carlos, survived past the first\nround, comfortably beating both Adam Gray\n(Bangor 1) and Connor Thorogood (Warwick\n2) by the same 2-0 score line to set up a last 32\nclash with Ben Parslew (Manchester 1).\nCarlos continued his decent form to take\nthe first frame of the third round match but\nParslew, who later lost to eventual winner,\nTom Barrett (Nottingham 1), stormed back\nwith a solid clearance in the second. Some astute tactical play in the following two frames\nearned Parslew a 3-1 victory to knock out the\nImperial captain.\nThings became considerably worse when\nImperial came up against Warwick 1s in the\nTeam Championship group stage. A cool and\ncomposed performance from late riser Max\nChalmers was enough to prevent a whitewash\nbut it did little to detract from an embarrassing\n9-1 defeat for Imperial.\nIt was a fairly dejected Imperial team that left\nRileys that evening. Cue a nice relaxing meal\nat Nando\u2019s, followed by Match of the Day and\na good night\u2019s sleep at the Igloo Hostel, where\nthe team attempted to recover from the horrors\nof the day just gone (all except Captain Carlos,\nwho refused to share a double bed with another\nguy and consequently spent the night curled up\non a sofa in the foetal position).\nAll of the above proved to be the perfect\ntonic as the team had a much improved second\nday at the tournament.\nCarlos opened the match against a vastly\nexperienced Manchester 2 side with a win\nagainst opposing team captain Andy Fores.\nLater, Andrew Leung potted some outrageous\nballs, including a full-length double on the\nblack, to put Imperial 2-1 up.\nManchester fought back to take a 5-3 lead\nbut Lambrianos and Shyam Pankhania both\nwon their final frames in convincing fashion to\nrescue a draw for Imperial.\nThe result, however, was not enough to qualify for the knockout stages of the Team Championship. Instead, Imperial dropped into the\nQuarter Finals of the Team Plate, where they\nfaced another strong team in Birmingham 1s.\nImperial got off to a cracking start and raced\ninto a 4-0 lead; the most notable performance\ncoming from Leung, who once again displayed\na knack for potting ridiculous balls to stun arguably Birmingham\u2019s best player, Mike Richards.\nHowever, a spectacular collapse by Imperial\nand an equally resurgent performance from the\nBirmingham team saw the former improbably\nsnatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Missed\nblacks and botched clearances from everyone\nin the Imperial team ensured a 4-6 loss to the\neventual runners-up.\nDespite the miserable nature of the defeat, as\nwell as some of the poor performances on the\nSaturday, every member of the team thoroughly enjoyed the weekend and gained some invaluable experience ahead of the season finale,\nthe BUCS Pool Championships in February.\nMany thanks should go to the Nottingham\nUniversity Snooker and Pool Club for organising a fantastic tournament and, no doubt, Imperial will return stronger next year.\nAs for the performance this time around,\nit was succinctly summed up by Chalmers:\n\u201c[We\u2019ve] had an absolute shocker!\u201d\nTo relive the events as they happened, visit\nhttp://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/snooker_bil-liards/pool/english/updates.php for our website page containing the live updates from the\nweekend.\nElwin Carlos\nPool\nSports Editors: Indy Leclercq\nDavid Wilson\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPool team suffer \u201cabsolute shocker\u201d at BUCS 8-ball Championships\nThey have pool cues, and they\u2019re not happy they lost.

    "content": "MUSIC\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nBalam Acab\nWander/Wonder\nTri Angle\n2011\nYou know those music writers who twist meaningless metaphor around meaningless metaphor in\na futile attempt to recreate the music on paper?\nWander/Wonder is basically that kind of reviewer\u2019s\nwet dream. But it also a bear-trap for anyone who\nthinks they\u2019re going to slide along without using\nthe word \u201carrangements\u201d \u2013 dammit Pitchfork, wtf\ndoes that even mean?!? So I\u2019m going to try my\nbest not to fall into douchebaggery and be completely straightforward about this intensely beautiful album.\nBalam Acab (Harry Potter spell? Really nasty\nskin problem? Name of a Somali Pirate King?) is\na 20-year-old producer who\u2019s managed to express\nhimself emotionally in more ways than I\u2019ll be able\nto when I have grandchildren. Alec Koone\u2019s (lol)\nmusic is 100% abstract electronica; he floats\nsomewhere between instrumental hip-hop producers like Clams Casino and the R&B-infused\nrhythms of How to Dress Well. (As you might expect from most \u2018intelligent\u2019 electronic music, his\nsongs are awash with stretched out, ethereal vo-cals.)\nAll right, I can\u2019t hold it any longer; I\u2019m bringing\nin the over-extended metaphors. If Bon Iver\u2019s For\nEmma, Forever Ago brought with it the sounds of a\nlonely log-cabin, Balam Acab takes you to a dark\nsecluded cave and tells you not to come back until\nyou\u2019ve gazed at the stars, stubbornly resisted the\nmorning sunlight, and thoroughly indulged every\nnostalgic fibre in your body.\nIf you know what Pitchfork writers are talking about\nwhen they say \u201carrangements\u201d, tweet me @kad-himshubber. If you\u2019re similarly dumbfounded, tweet\nsomething irritating and boorish @pitchforkmedia.\nBetter still, tweet @thebalamacab and say \u201cthanks\nfor the sweet album, bro!\u201d\nTo celebrate our 1500th issue Stephen Smith names the 15 be\nTop fifteen: the best a\nL\nists such as this are always contra-versial. Why no Beatles or Radiohead albums? Why no Jazz, Classical or Electronic music? This is\nsimply a list of the fifteen albums\nwhich I have found to be the most rewarding\nafter repeated listens. It is not a list of the most\ninfluential, original or well-executed groups of\nsongs.\nWhether or not you agree with my choices,\nwhy not share your favourite 15 albums by\nemailing us at music.felix@gmail.com?\nOften criticised for being extremely twee, the\nonly Scottish entry here is an album of acoustic\npop songs: gentle and understated, and dripping with irony.\nBelle & Sebastian\u2019s excellent debut - heavily influenced by Nick Drake and The Smiths\n- is a tour of the imagination of a sexually con-fused, introverted, bookish schoolgirl.\nOpening with the impossibly soothing and\nsurreal \u2018The State I Am In,\u2019and ending with the\nbeautifully melancholy chamber pop of \u2018Mary\nJo,\u2019 Tigermilk is a call out to shy and eccentric\nteenagers the world over: ignore normal people\nand follow your dreams when you\u2019re young, or\nyou\u2019ll end up a lonely, gin-drinking, cigarette-smoking failure.\nBest tracks: \u2018The State I Am In\u2019\n\u2018Expectations\u2019\nIf I said this album was a mixture of Pop and\nRock n\u2019 Roll with a hint of Country, you would\nbe justified in questioning how it made it onto\nthis list. But Truelove\u2019s Gutter really is the pinnacle of what Elvis-style Rock can achieve.\nExtremely moving, at times tear-inducingly so,\nthis is an album of pain and despair.\nBut don\u2019t let that put you off! Hawley, invoking the vocal style of Scott Walker, channels\nhis depression into an artwork of immense\nbeauty.\nBut it would probably be best to skip track 3:\nit is the definition of an anomalous point.\nBest Tracks: \u2018Open Up Your Door\u2019\n\u2018Soldier On\u2019\nDark, bleak, grim dance-rock is what awaits\nthe first-time listener to Unknown Pleasures, a\nslow trudge through the troubled mind of soon-to-die Ian Curtis.\nFrom the upbeat opener \u2018Disorder\u2019 to the lethargic and challenging \u2018I Remember Nothing,\u2019\nthis album puts listeners into a trance of beautiful musical depression.\nBest Tracks: \u2018Disorder\u2019\n\u2018Shadowplay\u2019\nBryter Layter is deceptively upbeat. Sunny,\nsmile-inducing folk-pop tunes accompany\nNick Drake\u2019s lovely, gentle voice; yet the truth\nis in the lyrics: \u201cNobody knows/ How cold it\ngrows/ Nobody sees/ How shaky my knees,\u201d\nsings Drake on \u2018Poor Boy\u2019.\nLike Ian Curtis (above), Drake was a couple\nof years away from suicide when this was re-corded. But even without the \u201ctroubled genius\u201d\ntag which accompanies such artists, he stands\nout as a writer of great folk songs and a remarkable guitarist.\nListen out for the future sound of Belle & Sebastian in \u2018Hazey Jane II\u2019.\nBest tracks: \u2018Hazey Jane II\u2019\n\u2018Northern Sky\u2019\nThe first and only rock opera to feature here,\nand one almost universally hated by critics,\nThe Hazards of Love follows the rather peculiar story of a woman who falls in love with a\nforest boy.\nBut the album excels in spite of the ridiculous and unlikely story line. With its sea of epic\n(in the Homeric sense) songs, the album brings\na whole new meaning to folk-rock.\nWith heavily amplified guitars replacing the\ngentle acoustics of their previous albums, the\nonly recognisable Decemberists feature here is\nsinger Colin Meloy\u2019s distinctive voice.\nIt is, nonetheless, essential listening for folk\nand rock fans alike, a great example of what\nrock anthems should be.\nBest tracks: \u2018The Hazards of Love 2\u2019\n\u2018Isn\u2019t it a Lovely Night\u2019\nSandwiched as it is between her two most successful albums, Blue and Court and Spark,\nmany people approach Joni Mitchell\u2019s For\nThe Roses wondering why it is so lacking in\npopularity. After listening, the answer is abundantly clear: the album is extremely complex\nlyrically and musically.\nTackling issues like the dichotomy between\nrural isolation and freedom, and the subtleties\nof romantic competition, this album takes at\nleast 20 listens to \u201cget\u201d. But the experience is a\nrewarding one.\nMitchell writes songs like poems, paying no\nattention to accessibility or radio-friendliness.\nIn fact, track 9, \u2018You Turn Me On, I\u2019m a Radio,\u2019 is her ironic attempt to get airplay.\nBest tracks: \u2018Lesson in Suvival\u2019\n\u2018Let the Wind Carry Me\u2019\nWho would\u2019ve guessed that the Mystery Jets,\nfamous for incredibly dull pop songs like\n\u2018Young Love\u2019 and \u2018Two Doors Down,\u2019 actually\nmade some very good music before falling for\nthe evil mistress that is commercial success?\nTheir remarkable debut, Making Dens, is\nperhaps best described as an extremely worthwhile musical experience. Clearly influenced\nby Kate Bush and early Pink Floyd, the album\nis certainly psychedelic, or maybe it\u2019s prog-rock. Or maybe space-rock.\nWho knows? The point is, this is a weird\nand wonderful collection of great songs. It\u2019s a\nshame about their later albums though...\nBest tracks: \u2018Zoo Time\u2019\n\u2018Making Dens\u2019\n\u2018Love Will Tear Us Apart\u2019 is not all there is to\nJoy Division. In fact, the rest of their songs are\nrather different, and, I think, rather better.\nRichard Hawley\nTruelove\u2019s Gutter\nMute\n2009\nJoy Division\nUnknown Pleasures\nFactory\n1979\nBelle & Sebastian\nTigermilk\nElectric Honey\n1996\nJoni Mitchell\nFor The Roses\nAsylum\n1972\nMystery Jets\nMaking Dens\n679 Recordings\n2006\nNick Drake\nBryter Layter\nIsland\n1970\nThe Decemberists\nThe Hazards of Love\nRough Trade\n2009\nFELIX\n36 Friday 04 november 2011\nMusic Editors: I\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nStephen Smith\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nBe sure not to miss...\nSan Francisco cut/paste sound collage pioneers\nNegativLand team up with fellow Fog City resident\nWobbly for an evening of home made electronics.\nThe collaboration is centred around the exploitation\nof The Booper, a fully analogue device put together\nfrom salvaged radio and amplifier parts, creating an\nunpredictable beast whose temperament is as mysterious as the racket it generates.\nSupport comes from prolific Argentinian noiser Alan\nCourtis and Evol\u2019s \u201ccomputer music for hooligans.\u201d\nI\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nNegativWobblyLand\nCafe Oto, Dalston Kingsland\nWednesday 9, November\n\n"

    "content": "Melancholia\nPros: Kirsten Dunst was awarded the Best Actress Award at Cannes\nthis year, and Lars von Trier\u2019s stylish look at the end of the world is\na sensational, thrilling ride, even with its long running time. Dunst\nand Charlotte Gainsbourg are both outstanding in their roles, and\nvon Trier\u2019s usual invasive, perceptive direction is, as always, breath-taking.\nCons: von Trier is famous for attracting controversy and this cannot\nwork as a positive factor. And like most von Trier films, critics were\npolarised in their opinions, which will do the same to the voters.\nIt\u2019s a demanding picture, and therefore will create problems to make\nsome real enthusiasts.\nThe Tree of Life\nPros: Already awarded the top gong at the Cannes Film Festival,\nTerrence Malick\u2019s carefully directed, visually impressive film was\none of the most critically praised films of the year. It also managed to\nsecure more than adequate business for an art-house film, even over\nthe summer when it faced stiff competition from popular superhero\nfilms.\nCons: Malick isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, as evidence by his 1999\ndefeat with The Thin Red Line to a much inferior Saving Private\nRyan. Being a press-shy director, any promotional work will have to\ncome from its cast and producers which might not be enough.\nA Dangerous Method\nPros: A fascinating account of how two of the greatest minds in\nthe 20th Century gave birth to psychoanalysis, David Cronenberg\u2019s\nhighly sensual biopic drama is as intense as it is entertaining, with\nthree leads giving it all in their challenging roles. Michael Fassbender gives yet another fantastic performance as Sigmund Freud, and\nViggo Mortensen, in his third collaboration with Cronenberg, may\nscore a second Oscar nomination under the same director, with his\nstrong, balanced supporting turn as Carl Jung.\nCons: Psychosexual dramas are hard to advertise for, despite the im-pressive, loud, dramatic trailer that has already been released, the\nsubject matter in itself, will be immediately repulsive to many.\nWe Need to Talk About Kevin\nPros: With critics worldwide praising its lead actress Tilda Swinton, this dark and twisted family drama is one to watch. Already a\nBest Picture winner at the BFI London Film Festival, if this positive\nmomentum keeps going, it could well end up in the final few films\nrunning for this year\u2019s top prize.\nCons: Oddly, many of Swinton\u2019s films are brushed off during awards\nseasons, no matter what kind of a brave performance she wonderfully tackles. Most notable was last year\u2019s I Am Love, that was completely ignored. Her choice in films is unusual for sure, and perhaps\nthe boundless unique twists her films present are too much to handle.\nWarrior\nPros: Triumphant boxing dramas are always an Academy favourite.\nThrow in some sibling rivalry and a monstrous parent then you\u2019ve\ngot last year\u2019s The Fighter, that made the top ten. What you also get\nwith that same formula (except without boxing, this time it\u2019s mixed\nmartial arts) is Warrior, a powerful, stirring sports drama. Sure it had\nits share of clich\u00e9s, but word is, everyone loved the final showdown\nbetween the two brothers.\nCons: It\u2019s too obvious as a choice, which may act against the film.\nTom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are no Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Whereas Nick Nolte may not be as hot a favourite as Melissa\nLeo was. It looks like a watered down version of The Fighter in\nterms of quality, which is why this may not make the cut.\nCoriolanus\nPros: Ever since it premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February,\nRalph Fiennes\u2019 directorial debut was met with praise, particularly for\nadapting one of the Shakespeare\u2019s less well-known plays and making it\naccessible to the audience with guns, no less. The critics are also loving\nVanessa Redgrave\u2019s role as Volumnia, the ambitious, ruthless mother of\nCoriolanus.\nCons: The film has been around for a while, and now the only substantial buzz that still exists is around Redgrave, with no mention of how the\nfilm itself will play out in bigger awards. So will the studio invest time\nand money in backing the film? Probably not, and instead will focus on\nRedgrave.\nThe Deep Blue Sea\nPros: Terrence Davis returns to direct once more and the British veteran\ndirector adapts Terrence Rattigan\u2019s play about love, its complications\nand the concept of life and death. It\u2019s a small, yet highly dense film\nwith emotions flying high as the love triangle between a woman (Rachel\nWeisz), her older husband (Simon Russell Beale), and her young lover\n(Tom Hiddleston) starts to reach its climax. Weisz gives a finely tuned\nperformance, whilst the two males she acts against provide firm support.\nCons: It\u2019s slow, highly depressing and despite the phenomenal cast\u2019s\nsturdy effort, the film doesn\u2019t quite have the emotional pay-off we were\nall anticipating during its lengthy set-up. It may be too subtle to absolutely grasp everyone\u2019s attention, with the gloomy atmosphere not helping with its advertising.\nThe Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn\nPros: Another highly-anticipated Steven Spielberg film out this year,\nthis time a fun, family adventure aimed for a large Christmas audience.\nSpielberg gave birth to Indiana Jones and Peter Jackson acting as the\nfilm\u2019s producer is a great sign. It features some state of the art computer\ngraphics as well as exhilarating action scenes that serve perfectly as\nend-of-year treat for families worldwide.\nCons: Faces the same problem Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cHugo\u201d does. Films\nlike this don\u2019t usually get acknowledged in the Best Picture category,\nand will probably stand a better chance in Best Animated Film.\nContagion\nPros: With a promising director, an array of stars, and a tightly plotted\nscript, Steven Soderbergh presents one heck of a realistic, get-under-your-skin disaster film that clings on to you with plenty to feel afraid\nabout. It\u2019s a chilling, effective disaster film, with a remarkably consistent director who knows how to keep the tension running.\nCons: It\u2019s just hard to imagine a semi-blockbuster such as this one being\nconsidered. Well respected for its many surprises given its often struggling and predictable sub-genre, but was it loved enough to go far in this\nrace? Very unlikely.\nRampart\nPros: It was recently announced that Woody Harrelson\u2019s latest corrupt\ncop drama would get a limited late November release in North America,\npresumably leading up to the awards season. This is great news, since\nthis unique, daring tale of a policeman struggling to find peace at his\njob and home, as well as Harrelson\u2019s powerhouse performance need to\nbe seen.\nCons: Virtually unknown until quite literally a few days ago, the film\nneeds to make one heck of an impact to break in. There is hardly any\nhype surrounding this as of now, no matter how much of a diverse, versatile career Harrelson has had over the years.\nHonourable mentions: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,\nBeginners, The Lady, Margin Call, Anonymous, Super 8, Jane Eyre\nFILM\nFELIX\n46\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 NOVEMBER 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n40\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nJames Simpson\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 November 2011\nAfter three different Waterstones (ironically,\nnobody could find the single copy supposedly\nin stock) and two failed Amazon deliveries, I\nfinally got my hands on the book: \u201cThe Thick\nof It: The Missing DoSAC Files\u201d. Bringing to\nthe paper Armando Iannucci\u2019s BAFTA-winning\ncomedy, this brilliant set of documents has provided me with enough entertainment for another\ndecade (or at least until the next series).\nThe Thick of It is the BBC\u2019s modern day Yes,\nPrime Minister. Taking place in the fictional\nDepartment of Social Affairs and Citizenship\n(DoSAC), the show is a dark humoured, satirical\nportrayal of the machinations and workings of\nBlair and Brown\u2019s Labour government. During\nthe first two series, Hugh Abbot (Chris Langham) is the depressed and sarcastic minister,\ntrying his best to make himself into someone of\nimportance but plagued by the press about his\nsecond flat in central London. Sadly enough for\nhis brilliant character, Langham was then arrested on charges related to child pornography.\nThe rest of the cast remained for the third series\nwith a new addition and replacement minister:\nthe slightly insane and incapable Nicola Murray\n(Rebecca Front). Other cast members include\nJames Smith, Joanna Scanlan, Roger Allam and\nChris Addison, who is thankfully a better actor\nthan comedian.\nThe characters are built on every clich\u00e9 you\ncan think of, then even more and better ones.\nThe civil service is incompetent, smug and lazy\nbut often called to save the minister from his/her\nblunders. The political advisers are either completely powerless or overly arrogant and useless.\nThe ministers themselves are gaffe-prone, incompetent and press targets. The country is quite\nsimply being ruled by a bunch of lunatics, a\nfairly good reflection of the reality to be honest.\nThe pure genius of the series and the script\nwriters however resides in Malcolm Tucker.\nPick of the week\nWatch \u2018em, yo\nFriday | 2100 - 2130 | BBC3\nHim & Her\nSeries two of BBC3\u2019s most popular sitcom ever\ncontinues.\nSaturday | 2000 - 2030 | BBC2\nDad\u2019s Army\nPike tempts fate by taking his girlfriend Sylvia\nout to the cinema in Mainwaring\u2019s new staff car \u2013\nwhich promptly breaks down, leaving them stranded miles from anywhere.

Comedy, guest starring Ralph\nFiennes.\nA hapless ex-lawyer (Elijah Wood) wakes up\nafter trying to commit suicide the night before.\nClearly a fruitless attempt \u2013 damn you sugar\npills! Ryan is confronted by his neighbour, Jenna, asking him to look after her dog, the eponymous Wilfred (played superbly by Jason Gann,\nand no, I hadn\u2019t heard of him either). Ryan\u2019s\nopinion of Jenna is fairly self evident \u2013 she\u2019s\npretty hot \u2013 so he obliges.\nEnter Wilfred \u2013 a dirty grey mongrel \u2013 but to\nRyan, Wilfred is not a dog, but a bearded Aussie in a dog costume. An audacious dog at that,\none who drinks beer, smokes pot and attempts\nto nuzzle in the breasts of any reasonably looking girl. Understandable, I suppose.\nThe writers manage to create a quirky but\nstrangely realistic synergy between Wilfred\nand Ryan (who ends up looking after him in-definitely). Ryan\u2019s feelings for Jenna are apparent to Wilfred \u2013 and as the saying goes \u2018a dog is\na man\u2019s best friend\u2019\u2013 ergo Ryan is a target. This\nis actually the very concept which gave rise to\nthe original Australian version of the show. The\nmain difference to reality is obviously we are\ntreated to Wilfred\u2019s outlook on things. As the\nseries progresses we learn Jenna has a boyfriend (bet you didn\u2019t see that one coming),\nhe\u2019s also one of those typically American sporting stereotypes (read: dick). Did somebody say\nclich\u00e9?\nWhilst making you laugh Wilfred also manages to make you think. The whole show is\nbased around perception; Ryan and the viewer\nget to understand, amongst other things, what\nlife as a dog is like. The first time you truly\nget an idea of this arises when Ryan takes\nWilfred to the beach \u2013 a \u201cNo Dogs Allowed\u201d\nsort of beach. Of course Wilfred has his way\nby guilt tripping Ryan and get\u2019s to go in the\nocean. There\u2019s something quite heartwarming\nand charming when Wilfred is excitedly shouting \u201cRyan! I\u2019m in the ocean! Oh Ryan watch\nthis! Ryan! It\u2019s a Pelican! It\u2019s a Pelican!\u201d in his\nmagnanimous Australian accent.\nEach episode centres around the theme of an\nopening quotation; Ryan is thrown by Wilfred\n(usually by means of trickery or guilt) into a\nchaotic situation involving that theme. We see\nhim, amongst other things, defecating into his\nneighbour\u2019s boot, as you do. Something positive arises and a lesson is learnt about aforementioned theme, be it trust, happiness, fear,\nacceptance or something else. From this Ryan\nslowly begins to live a fulfilled life. Thankfully\nthis is pulled off in such a way that for once you\naren\u2019t left feeling that little bit sick about all the\n\u2018this is how to live your life\u2019 advocacy. Wilfred\nis clever, amusing and above all unique.\nMalcolm Tucker, the director of communications for the government, the Labour party spin\ndoctor, the man who effectively runs the place\nis, in my opinion, one of the greatest creations\nof British comedy. Played by Peter Capaldi, the\nswearing Scotsman always gets what he wants,\nand by any means, morally acceptable or not.\nHe has some of the best swearing abilities in the\ncountry and quite simply walks around Whitehall ready to shout at and bully anybody into\nsubmission. He is the guy who gets a cake from\nthe Prime Minister saying \u201chappy birthday c*nt\u201d\n(a clear sign of love), is nicknamed Hamish\nMacDeath and who will compare you to being\n\u201cas much use as a marzipan dildo\u201d or \u201ca sweaty\noctopus trying to unhook a bra\u201d. In the Christmas specials, Tucker has to deal with the change\nin leadership and as the power sways from one\ncandidate to another, he succeeds in getting into\na food fight, destroying the hopes and dreams of\na young MP and making himself indispensable\nto all potential prime ministers. The third series\nsee the swearing genius slowly loosing grip, but\nno worries, he is The Man and somehow always\nends up pulling the strings to his advantage. If\nyou haven\u2019t had enough of him, Jamie MacDonald, No.10\u2019s press officer, is equally qualified in\nabusive language, bullying and manipulation.\nThe fast pace of the show, wittiness of the\ndialogue and hand-held camera work give The\nThick of It a realistic documentary style. The\nplot is also often based on actual events, as are\nthe characters with Campbell and Mandelson\nbeing the main sources of inspiration for Tucker.\nThe Christmas special is focused on the power\nstruggle following the resignation and appointment of a new prime minister, as took place in\n2007. Opposition characters were introduced in\nthe specials and the third series, leading to its\nculmination at the pending election in May 2010.\nWhen the results came out, Iannucci went on to\nthank Nick Clegg \u201cfor completely destroying\nour plans for the next series\u201d. And effectively,\nthey are a couple years late, with filming starting in March 2012. The new series will picture\nthe coalition government in power with its inner\ntensions and Malcolm Tucker in the opposition.\nThe series have also led to a couple of spin-offs: the film In the Loop received an Oscar\nnomination for best adapted screenplay. In addi-tion, Veep, HBO\u2019s Americanisation of the show\nis soon to be aired. Unique in its style, the show\neven has a swearing consultant. This brilliantly\nfunny, smart and well written comedy picturing\nthe dysfunctional government with a cast of excellent actors comes highly recommended.\nWell, they\u2019re in The Thick of It now...\nThought the Government were in trouble?\nWilfred - bizarre humour has a new leash of life\nTELEVISION\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nConstipation has become a serious issue in 2012\u2019s government\nGeorge Barnett\n\n"

Light Bearer is their debut full-length release and a jolly good\none at that. The album, released on 21st\nOctober 2011 on ondryland records has\nbeen labelled with many genres from indie to mathcore but all you need to know\nis that it\u2019s super fucking sweet. Everyone\nknows hardcore bands are awesome. it\u2019s\njust a fact, and while this band may not\nbe strictly hardcore, this fact definitely\napplies to them.\nBuy this album, whack it in the old\nwalkman and put on your headphones,\nafter a short intro you will start to feel\na funny sensation. It doesn\u2019t take long\nto realise that this is your face being\npunched in so hard that it\u2019s pulled off\nof your skull and melted with a massive\nfucking piece of fire. Or something. Then\njust while you\u2019re in the midst of this ridiculous onslaught of grinding riffs and\nirregular time signatures, you hit the\ncentre-piece of the album, the eye of\nthe storm, a track entitled \u2018Super Five\u2019.\nThe chilling softness of the song allows\nyou to recuperate slightly and relax your\npummelled eardrums. However this\nsense of security is short lived as you are\nyet again propelled into the sheer chaos\nthat is \u2018Light Bearer\u2019.\nThe album has you reaching for the repeat button as it continues to amaze until\nthe very end of the climactic final number\n\u2018Above the Abyss\u2019 with Adebisi Shank\nguitarist Lar Kaye chipping in for good\nmeasure. While the album does have a\nhardcore vibe running throughout, almost\nevery track has gentle, angular guitar\nparts and memorable vocal melodies in-tertwined. The construction of conflicting\nsounds makes this release an absolute\nmust-have for anyone. If you have been\nat all interested by this incredibly poorly\nconstructed piece of written information\n(thanks science) then buy this album now\n(either on iTunes or andyouandi.net).\nThink of it this way, you can either buy\nthis album or continue to spend your student loan on vast amounts of cheap beer,\ncheap porn and cheap food. Do you literally want to become a mega drunkard\nmasturbating lardman? Yes? That\u2019s sick,\nand something else sick is that you can\noften find &U&I doing shows in London\nand if you happen to see one advertised\nthen go, the shows are even better than\nthe album. Seriously, buy this album, go\nto a show, if you don\u2019t love it then at least\nyou can be safe in the knowledge that you\nare dead inside.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 04 NOVEMber 2011 27\nI\nn 2006, with the publication of\nRichard Dawkins\u2019 \u201cThe God Delusion\u201d, modern atheism found\na new vigour. The book has sold\nover 2 million copies worldwide\nand is highly regarded by many as being a\npowerful rational argument against belief\nin God. Dawkins, described by many as\nbeing \u201cevangelistic\u201d or even \u201cmilitant\u201d,\nhas come to be seen as one of the leaders\nof \u201cNew Atheism\u201d and regards himself as\nbeing a patron of intelligent thought, one\nwho follows the evidence to the conclusion that God does not exist.\nInterestingly, for someone who argues\nso passionately for the position of rationality and evidence in belief, \u201cThe God\nDelusion\u201d only contains one chapter on\nthe evidence opposing Dawkins\u2019 atheistic belief. He quickly dismisses any\nrationality behind belief in God with his\n\u201cUltimate Boeing 747\u201d argument (which\ncuriously only claims to refute one of the\narguments for the existence of God listed\nin his previous chapters). Dawkins titled\nthis chapter: \u201cWhy there almost certainly\nisn\u2019t a God\u201d, a very assertive title and one\nthat he has defended before in public debate with academics such as John Lennox\nand Alistair McGrath.\nSo why does Dawkins constantly refuse\nto debate American philosopher William\nLane Craig? William Lane Craig has written over 30 books and hundreds of academic articles, he is widely viewed as one\nof the most competent defenders of belief\nin God and has debated many reputable\nEoghan J. Totten\nJoshua Fountain\nShould climate change be labelled?\nThere\u2019s probably no Dawkins...\natheists including Peter Atkins, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett.Yet despite several invitations to debate from the\nBritish Humanist Association as well as\nOxford and Cambridge Christian unions,\nDawkins has flatly refused, prompting the\nquestion of why someone so dedicated to\nreason and evidence would refuse an opportunity for debate on this important is-sue.\nIn the past, Dawkins has said that he\nwould only debate with \u201cat least a Bishop\u201d, though interestingly he has previously debated academics, and has even\nsat on a panel with Craig before. Another\nexcuse for turning down the chance to debate Craig is that Dawkins doesn\u2019t debate\nCreationists, except that Professor Craig\nis not a Creationist and has never advocated Creationism. More recently, Dawkins\nhas suggested that his refusal to debate is\ndue to Craig\u2019s defence of the Old Testament (which begs the question of whether\nDawkins will only debate those he agrees\nwith).\nAll this has lead Dr. Daniel Came, an\natheist philosopher at Oxford University,\nto write a letter to Professor Dawkins say-ing: \u201cThe absence of a debate with the\nforemost apologist for Christian theism is\na glaring omission on your CV and is of\ncourse apt to be interpreted as cowardice\non your part.\u201d Craig is one of the many\nphilosophers to have written critiques of\n\u201cThe God Delusion\u201d and an especially\npowerful rebuttal to the \u201cUltimate boeing\n747\u201d argument (one which Dawkins has\nI\nread over my last article and it\nseemed a bit too esoteric\u2026 and\nwe\u2019re all scientists after all, so I\u2019ll\ntry and keep to the facts this time.\nThere is a multitude of stigma\nattached to climate change. Some say\nwe\u2019re still on a positive temperature\ntrend in the wake of an Ice Age ten millennia ago, others say it would prove\nfruitless to tackle a problem of such a\nlarge order and others, moreover, believe the human race is the sole source\nof the problem and that a time will come\nwhen the Pennines are swept away by a\nmassive tsunami\u2026\nI, for one, believe it to be derived\nfrom a plethora of factors, including\nmany listed above. This is the cusp of\nthe matter: by recognising it as an all-consuming phenomenon we negate the\nfact that the only way to tackle climate\nchange is through meeting the plurality of minutiae that make up the bigger\npicture. The sceptics are right: it is too\nbig to solve alone. Our only viable option is to delve deeper into our vocations\nand focus on our own chosen aspects of\nthe crisis. This way, we waste less time\non conversation and negotiation about\nwhat should be done and instead invest\nour thought in righteous and thorough\naction.\nIt would thus seem from the above\nthat we should rid climate change of its\nlabel. It should be integrated into everything we do, where it no longer becomes\na question of a rat-race to save the planet\nbut an ethical task to ensure righteous\naction, sustainability and the expansion\nof scientific boundaries. This dawned\non me after conversing with a German\nfriend in the kitchen, who succinctly\nstated, \u201cLook around you. The central\nheating\u2019s on, yet the windows are open.\nPeople will not consider these things\nuntil they are gone and, in some cases,\nirreplaceable.\u201d\nFace facts. If the West cuts its emissions of carbon dioxide and vastly reduces consumption of finite resources,\nit will be cancelled by the growth of\nBrazil, India, and China, who hold astronomical potential for growth. They have\na right to do so. After all, many parts of\nthe West have had 150 years of industrial\nboom. We are in no position to criticise.\nLooking closer, these developing countries are doing what they must to serve\ntheir population. We have exhausted in-dustrialisation. We have exhausted our\ninstantaneous, risk-taking economic sys-tem. Both follow future paths that lead\nto a fiery end. If we integrate the two,\nwe might just miss the flames. Maybe a\n\u2018Green Market\u2019is just what the West and\nespecially the United Kingdom needs\n(and of course Ireland ;]).\nI look out my window from Evelyn\nGardens and watch the traffic\u2026 Ferrari,\nLamborghini, Mercedes AMG, Bentley.\nThere\u2019s some wealth about South Kensington. Contrast that with the phenomenal statistic that one of the sole employers in the UK (500,000) is Tesco. Quite\na lot of those 500,000 roles involve me-yet to address).\nDawkins has been criticised by the academic community for his refusal to debate\nwith Dr. Craig, with many believing that\nhis turning down the debate is a sign that\nDawkins does not feel that he can engage\nin such a debate successfully. The Oxford\nCU has set up an open debate between\nCraig and Dawkins in the Sheldonian\nTheatre on the 25th of October, where\nthe opportunity was left open to Dawkins\nto show up at the last minute, and when\nhe didn\u2019t Craig debated an empty chair.\nA parody bus campaign was set up to\nadvertise the \u2018debate\u2019 using the slogan:\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably no Dawkins, Now stop\nworrying and enjoy October 25th at the\nSheldonian.\u201d\nAs part of Craig\u2019s UK tour he also delivered a lecture on Tuesday the 18th of\nOctober. The lecture was attended by\nover 250 people who listened to Craig expand on some of the arguments Dawkins\npresents in \u201cThe God Delusion\u201d, as well\nas presenting more that Dawkins does\nnot seem to address. For anyone wishing to examine the evidence (as Dawkins\npresumably would encourage us all to\ndo) the video of Craig\u2019s lecture is not to\nbe missed.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n8\nWomen in science\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 04 NOVEMBER 2011\nE\nven Albert Einstein was versed\nin the difficulties facing those\nwho want a career in academic\nresearch. Those brave fools that,\neven in the face of riches proffered by industry, love research so much they\nare willing to attempt to climb the precipitous\nand slippery ladder that is UK academic science career progression.\nA recent campaign by \u2018Science is Vital\u2019, a\nnational gro up of concerned academics from\nprofessors to PhD students, last month created\na consultation report that was presented to the\nRt Hon David Willets, Minister for Universities and Science, highlighting their concerns\nabout the UK science career system, that many\nfear is near breaking point. They recognised\nthat obstacles are many, sacrifices plentiful and\nmorale low, in a system that rewards the lucky\nfew and stifles creativity and initiative, yet survives almost exclusively on the back-breaking\nwork of early career scientists.\nThe bleak reality is, in a time of austerity,\nresearch councils and funding bodies are obsessed with short term, low risk projects with\nfast turnovers, meaning post-doctoral positions are brief, and poorly paid relative to\nother sectors, with extreme competition for\nthe very few positions available. Some early\ncareer scientists may consequently seek international positions, resulting in a loss of intellect and skills in the UK. This forced mobility,\ncombined with the quick turnover of contracts,\nmeans the chance of a normal life outside of\nwork is slim, and those who want families and\nstability in their lives, especially women, face\na very difficult time. Take a break from your\ncareer, and suffer the consequences \u2013 worst of\nall, those unable to gain a position within a few\nyears of graduating from their PhD will find\ntheir experience useless and investment point-less, and pity the poor soul whose first postdoctoral project doesn\u2019t produce any results.\n\u2018Publications, publications, publications!\u2019 is a\nmantra we are all very familiar with, and is a\nresult of a system that rewards those who are\nlucky enough to find a PhD or post-doctoral\nproject guaranteed with lots of high profile\npapers. Early career scientists are left bereft\nby a system that prevents them from pursuing\ntheir own research ideas, with research councils responding to current fiscal pressure from\ngovernment by redirecting money away from\nearly career scientist grants.\nThere are an ever increasing number of PhD\nstudents and post-docs who want to become research group leaders and laboratory managers,\nbut never will do so due to static number of senior positions available in research institutions.\nWhilst this means cheap labour for current PIs,\nhuge amounts of money and effort is wasted on\ntraining, and there is currently very little provision of positions suitable for those who do not\nwant to write their own grants, but want to stay\nin research nonetheless. Shockingly, there is an\n80% loss of all trained, skilled and enthusiastic\npeople at each step of the career ladder, a level\nof attrition that is far from sustainable. There\nis additionally little provision of professional\ntraining for preparedness and skills relevant to\nalternative career paths in science but outside of\nthe academic realm, due to the short-term nature of most contracts. Of course, there is little\nimpetus to change a system that for senior scientists has worked and produces cheap labour,\nand the UK system, despite its foibles, is one of\nthe most productive in the world.\nEarly career scientists are not idiots, and are,\nfor the most part, aware of the risks associated\nwith pursuing a career path fraught with this\nmany obstacles. However, as recognised by\n\u2018Science is Vital\u2019, and indeed many academics,\nchanges are required to restructure the system\nconstructively. One solution could be the implementation of teaching fellowships at postdoctoral level with one or two years of teaching and outreach on top of research time, with\nexternal funding subsidised by university de-partments. This would increase contract length\nand stability, develop skills that would prepare\nindividuals for other options in science related\npositions, and make them more employable in\nlectureship posts. A similar program for PhD\nstudents could result in longer programs over\n4 or 5 years, with less PhD student numbers\n\u201cScience is a wonderful thing...\n...if one does not have to earn one\u2019s living at it\u201d. Carys Cook discusses\nsome of the difficulties facing early career scientists\nIn his Commemoration Day address this\nyear, the Rector, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions, recalled\na conversation he had with an alumnus of Imperial. The alumnus, who graduated in 1966,\ntold him that in her time here only 180 of\nthe 3500 students were women. Sir Keith\ntold those of us gathered at the Royal Albert\nHall that he had looked up the statistics and\nthis had been, in fact, a slight overestimate.\nHe used this as an example of the \u201cmassive\nchanges\u201d that have taken place at the college over recent years.\nA jump in the number of female students of\nthe college from around 5% in the 1960s to\nnearly 35% today is a substantial one, and is\nindicative of a general change in the number\nof women pursuing degrees and careers in\nthe sciences. However, there is still a long\nway left to go before we achieve an equal\nnumber of women and men in science.\nA study published in the journal Psychological Science recently found that the sexism\nof individuals in a society leads to gender inequality in the society as a whole. This is not\na surprising result, but the study is noteworthy because of its size: it covered 57 coun-tries. The conclusion is clear \u2014 if increased\nequality is the goal, then individual attitudes\nmust change.\nIn 1966, only 22 college accommodation\nrooms were available to women. Women\nwere not allowed into the Union bar until\n1972. Today, this same discrimination does\nnot exist, but there still exist gender stereotypes could damage women\u2019s chances of a\ncareer in science.\nWhen a stereotype \u2014 for example, \u201cgirls\ncan\u2019t do maths\u201d \u2014 is reiterated, it can do\nmore damage than you might expect. One\nstudy showed that when telling a group of\nstudents that an exam was designed to test\nwhat makes some students better at maths\nthan others, girls did worse than when they\nwere told that both genders generally perform equally on the test. This is because\nof an effect known as \u201cstereotype threat\u201d.\nStereotype threat has also been seen when\nwomen simply had to record their gender at\nthe start of an exam, or were in the minority\nduring the exam.\nA report published by the UKRC in 2010\nfound that, of the 5.5 million people working\nin science, engineering and technology occupations in the UK, only 12.3% were women.\nThe gender pay gap for science and technology professionals was 11%. The loss to the\nUK economy by qualified women scientists,\ntechnologists and engineers working below\ntheir level of qualification or being unemployed was estimated to be \u00a32 billion.\nSexism does not need to be overt to be\ndamaging. Small things \u2014 an offhand com-ment, a stupid joke \u2014 can add up over time\nto make a big difference. The sooner we become aware of this, the sooner we will see\nequal numbers of men and women doing sci-ence. And that will benefit all of us.\noverall. The lack of international experience\nwould be seen as detrimental if more post-docs\nstayed in the UK, but this could be countered\nby the development of more active mentoring\nand short-term career development opportunities with international institutions and col-laborators. For example, the Worldwide University Trust serves as one such platform, but\npro-active membership nationally is currently\nlacking. Other organisations such as the National Research Staff Association are taking\nactive roles in reassessing the current research\ncouncil funding system, with the recognition\nthat more long term funded projects and more\nfunding for early career scientists are required.\nUltimately, grants should be based on a proposal\u2019s scientific merit and not just the employment status or publication record of the\nearly career scientist who wrote it.\nTake home message time: for all you early\ncareer scientists, it\u2019s a beautiful thing you do\nand wonderfully rewarding personally, but\nyou have the power to help change the system\nthat does not adequately recognise your hard\nwork! Get involved in organisations such as\n\u2018Science is Vital\u2019, write to your local MP to\nexpress your concerns, and make active decisions to prepare yourself just in case it all goes\nwrong\u2026\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nAlbert Einstein reminds us to take him into account in neutrino measurements\nKelly Oakes\nScience Editor\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 04 november 2011 25\nCOMMENT\nI know you heard it on the grapevine, but we should tell you here.\nThe views expressed are the opinions of the authors, not Felix.\n\u201d\nI\n\u2019ve started eating porridge. I\nwaited and waited for the weather to get colder, but at some point\nit becomes obvious that I\u2019m going to lose the staring contest\nwith BBC Weather and I just break\nout the oats and jam. All year, I\u2019m just\nwaiting for winter to come around. So\nnow I\u2019m eating porridge every morning,\nI\u2019ve committed to that for the next few\nmonths.\nNow, I want you to feel at ease with\nyour choice of breakfast treat. Despite\nthe fact that I\u2019m fairly certain there is\nno finer way to kick off a miserable day\nof trudging through South Kensington\nthan a warm bowl of gloopy oats, I don\u2019t\nwant to preach about it. You want to\ncontinue eating Shreddies? That is absolutely fine with me. Similarly, I don\u2019t\nfeel like I\u2019m missing out. Yes, there are\nother cereals available. More pressing-ly, there are those that opt not to have\ncereals at all. But that\u2019s alright, because\nI\u2019ve made a choice for personal reasons,\nand it\u2019s the right one for me. I\u2019m Angry\nGeek, and I start my November mornings with porridge.\nIf we were to, say, replace porridge\nwith \u2018atheism\u2019 (bear with me here) and\ncereals with religion (I have no idea\nwhat muffins/crumpets represent here,\nyou can continue the analogy as you\nRhys Davies\nAngry Geek\nThe Portrait of the Cook as a Young Man\nReligious tolerance is oatso simple\nwish) we have an entirely different dis-cussion. I have decided not to believe in\nany god or gods, and I\u2019m comfortable\nwith that decision. Admittedly, there are\nsome mornings when my spiritual porridge has too little milk in and it goes\nall stodgy, but I manage to push on and\nstay true to my decision without trying\nto justify it to every motherfucker who\nbraves the cereal aisle in Sainsbury\u2019s.\nOthers seem less capable of doing this.\nI found myself last week in an extraordinarily overlong conversation with\nseveral staunch atheists about whether\nor not it made sense to choose one religion over any other. They delighted\nin laughing at Christians in general for\nthis reason (\u201cWhy not Judaism? Why\nnot Islam?\u201d), and when I suggested that\nperhaps many people felt modern-day\nreligions all expressed the same basic\ntruths, this was entirely unacceptable.\nWhy? Fuck knows. Everyone involved\nin the conversation had porridge for\nbreakfast... I mean, was an atheist.\nWhatever. Maybe both \u2013 I never enquired as to their morning preferences.\nWe were all atheists, yet for some\nreason we had to debate this meaningless detail of an alternative lifestyle,\nas if the mere existence of Christians\nin our immediate vicinity represented\nsome kind of flaw in our own reasoning.\nL\nooking back with the aged\neyes of a fourth year, I can\nreflect on my experiences\nhere and divise a pattern,\ncommon to all who pass\nthrough these halls. As a child, food\nwas just food. Food was also delicious.\nIn university, food is still delicious but\nit is suddenly so much more compli-cated. For the first time in my life, I\nam responsible for my own sustenance.\nWith a few mistakes made along the\nway, I am somehow still alive. There\nseem to be several distinct stages that\na student will pass through during their\ntime here.\nThe first stage involves a strong affinity with tin cans. The fresher student,\nunlearned in the ways of the kitchen,\nsubsists on a diet of things that he or\nshe can liberate from their tinned pris-ons. It has its analogies with the dawn\nof civilisation, when early man made\nproficient tools. Such tools obviously\nincluded the can-opener. This proto-stage of culinary evolution lasts generally for a term, maybe less, and ends\nviolently with the realisation that the\nbargain curry in a can was not actually\nfit for human consumption.\nThis is followed by the second stage,\nwhere outrage at chowing down on\nShergar drives the student to learn to\ncook. Nothing too complicated at first\nbut with experience comes imagina-tion. The tenets of this stage are that the\nfood is simple, filling, and definitely\ncame from an identifiable animal. Pastas and curries prevail in this phase.\nThe third stage is a natural progression of the second. It will start with the\ncheeky addition of herbs and spices to\nan otherwise-pedestrian Bolognese,\nand will grow into three-course meals\ncooked from scratch. Cookery programmes and cookbooks, presents from\nwell-meaning and concerned relatives\nwhich, untouched until now, are devoured with enthusiasm. This stage is\na culinary renaissance for the student,\nas ancient wisdom is rediscovered and\nadapted for the modern table.\nThis comes to an abrupt, explosive\nend. The palate may cry for Waitrose\u2019s\nfinest virgin olive oil and saffron, but\nthe wallet and the body cry for rest. Exhaustive in time and money, this stage\ncollapses under the strain of its own\nexcess. Replaced by a stage epitomised\nby food requiring a minimal amount of\neffort, time and money. This is age of\nthe take-away and vegging out in front\nof season box-sets of Grey\u2019s Anatomy\nand The Wire. This stage teaches the\nstudent valuable lessons about making\nfood last longer (often several days)\nand the sagacity of vouchers and cou-pons, and gives them greater appreciation for distant cultures. Mainly Italy\nand China.\nThe death knell of this stage is sounded when the student spends a little too\nlong looking in the mirror, and does\nnot like what they find there. A rejuvenation occurs, passion rekindles,\ninterest in the kitchen blossoms again.\nWise from the lessons of the previous\nstages, the student is enlightened. Everything in moderation. There is a time\nfor beans on toast and a time for Moroccan lamb tagine followed by raspberry compote. There is a time for a\nhearty bowl of spaghetti and time for a\nDominos thick crust special. Usually on\nTuesdays. Now, the student has become\nthe master of the kitchen, Lord over his\ndomain. Finally prepared, perhaps, for\nWhy is Crunchy Nut still on the shelves\nif porridge is so obviously right? What\nis the purpose of marmite in this period\nof rolled oats and preserved fruit? For\nsome reason these weren\u2019t just idle topics of discussion, but fierce points of\ncontention.\nIt was a couple of weeks ago in Felix\nthat Sam Horti mulled over the question\nof an afterlife. Surely in hell we would\nfeel no pain, he mused. How would we\nexperience pleasure in heaven without\nnerve endings and a hypothalmus? Ho\nho ho.\nThe only answer I can offer is that I\ndon\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how much\nmilk you should put on your Weetabix to\navoid complete loss of structural integ-rity. Maybe hell is, as I\u2019m often told by\nreligious friends, an expression of being\nabsent from God. An infinite stretch of\nthe eventual life beyond college walls.\nLike a fine wine: mature.\nThis history is by no means com-plete. I have neglected the lunchtime\nexperiments with various college cafes,\nthe 3am craving for Mars bars and the\nhypnotic attraction of the fridge light,\nor the expansion of the role of cereal\nto all three meals of the day, with or\nwithout milk. Though you will find it in\nno prospectus, this culinary education,\na gastronomical evolution, the portrait\nof a cook as a young man, is one of the\nfinest lessons you will ever learn at uni-versity.\nIf people start\ntrying to pour\ncornflakes into my\nbowl, I might be\nurged into action.\n\u201c\nIf peop\nIf peop\ntrying t\ntrying t\n\u201d\nThere is a time for\nbeans on toast\nand a time for\nMoroccan lamb\ntagine followed by\nraspberry compote.\n\u201c\nThere is\nThere is\nbeans o\nbeans o\ntime where you are devoid of the hope\nof a saviour. Maybe you just put the\nmilk on in little bursts and wait for it to\nbe soaked up before adding more.\nI don\u2019t know. But it means nothing to\nme anyway, because I am having porridge for breakfast tomorrow, and will\ncontinue to do so. If people start trying to pour cornflakes into my bowl, I\nmight be urged into action. But in the\nmeantime I think, as porridge eaters, we\npromote our preference for warm, tasty\nbreakfasts in a far more responsible and\nreasonable way by allowing other cereal\nchoices to coexist alongside our own.\nNext week - why same-sex marriages\nare a human right, explained through\ncomparison with chocolate bars.

    "content": "openness to god. I would encourage the\natheist to pray, for example, that if God is\nthere, he would reveal himself. I see it as\na both/and.\nYou\u2019ve debated some of the most well\nknown atheists in the world, the likes of\nDan Dennet, A.C. Grayling, as well as\nSam Harris and Christopher Hitchens\nas I\u2019ve mentioned before. When you\ntake part in these debates, what do you\nintend to get out of them? Is it your aim\nto convert atheists that are watching,\nor is your aim to simply get your views\nacross?\nThe purpose of these events is to illustrate\nto the university communities, in which\nthese debates are typically held, that\nthe Christian faith is a viable option for\nthinking men and women today. So often\nuniversity students have been told that it\nis irrational to be a Christian, that Christianity is for old ladies and little children\nbut no thinking adult can be an intelligent\nbeliever.That is so patently false and these\ndebates help to illustrate that.\nI could come on to a campus, as I did\nat Imperial, and give a lecture myself,\nunchallenged, but I think it\u2019s far more\neffective and credible when an atheist\nshares the platform with me, is given\nequal time and even the last word; and\nyet students still see that the Christian\nworldview comes out intellectually\nhead and shoulders above its competi-tors. I welcome the open dialogue with\natheists about this.\nIn contrast to a university event, if you\nare speaking at a predominantly Christian event, is your aim to affirm the\nfaith of those present or do you have\nanother motive?\nIt isn\u2019t just to affirm the faith of those\npersons, although it certainly is in part.\nContrary to what atheists say, Christians\nare actually pretty open minded and many\nstruggle with real doubts. They hear the\nobjections from the new atheists for ex-ample, and they trouble them and think\nabout them. Christians are not the brain\ndead people that atheists sometimes por-tray. Hearing that there are good reasons\nto believe as well as good answers to these\nobjections can affirm their faith.\nBut there is a further reasons why I\nwill sometimes speak to Christian au-diences, and this is to equip them. If\nChristians can be trained to give good\nreasons for what we believe and good\nanswers to unbelievers questions, they\nwill be more effective in sharing with\ntheir friends and family members the\ngood news of the gospel. And so I\u2019m\ninterested in equipping Christians to be\ngood witnesses to the truth of the Christian faith\nAs well as doing debates you do a lot\nof writing. Firstly, what do you enjoy\nmore?And secondly, what do you think\nis a more convincing form of argu-ment?\nThis is a really good question; I enjoy\nthem both so much. When I\u2019m at home\nin my study writing I often think: \u201cGosh,\nI wish I could be out on the road speaking or debating.\u201d When I\u2019m travelling and\ndebating I often think: \u201cI wish I could be\nin my study, writing in peace and quiet.\u201d\nThey\u2019re both really wonderful opportunities and I enjoy both and do both equally.\nIn terms of which is more effective,\nI once would\u2019ve said, and I\u2019m still inclined to think, that the writing and\nresearch is more effective at reaching\npeople because my circumference of\npersonal contacts is so limited compared to the written work; my books get\ninto university libraries, where they will\nbe for generations. My goal as a writer\nis to leave a legacy that outlives myself.\nHowever, since the development of\nthe internet and YouTube, it turns out\nthat those who see me live, such as at\nImperial College, turns out to be a tiny\nminority. There will be tens of thousands of people who will watch that\nYouTube video. I have never put a video on YouTube, but other people pirate\nthem and put them up, and I recently\nsaw a Google statistic that these Dr\nCraig video sites have had over 4 million views.\nThat is far more than I\u2019ve sold in\nterms of books; so it may well be that\nthe public speaking will actually reach\nmore people because it too is archived\nin this way, and reaches far more people\nthan I do in the actual live audience.\nJust two more questions before we fin-ish; the first is about Richard Dawkins.\nThere\u2019s been a lot of back and forth between yourself and Professor Dawkins,\nand I was just wondering if you\u2019ve read\nhis recent article in the Guardian?\nI have read it but I just want to say that\nthere hasn\u2019t been a back and forth between me and Richard Dawkins; I have\nnot responded to any of this. All of this is\ngenerated by other people who invite him\nand me to be in these debates, who have\nstarted this bus campaign in Oxford, who\nhave made these YouTube videos. I don\u2019t\nhave anything to do with that. I have preferred to stay out of this and watch as an\namused bystander. So yes I have read the\narticle, but I\u2019m not going to respond.\nLastly, I just want to get your thoughts\non the future of the atheist-theist de-bate. What do you think the questions\nwe\u2019ll be asking in, say, 100 years time\nwill be? Do you think we will be asking\nthe same questions that we\u2019re asking\nnow?\nI do, these are perennial questions; I think\nthe problem of suffering and evil, and the\nhidden nature of God will always be the\nprimary reason for doubt about God\u2019s ex-istence. I think modern science will continue to discover facts about nature and\nthe world we live in that point beyond itself to a transcendent creator and designer\nof the universe.\nThe moral argument will always be\nwith us because we will always be ask-ing: what is the foundation for moral\nvalues and duties? Do they even exist objectively or is everything relative? These\nI think are perennial questions which will\nbe with us in a hundred years time.\nOnce again, thank you very much for\nagreeing to speak to us, we appreciate\nyou taking the time, and good luck on\nthe rest of your UK tour.\nCertainly, thank you.\n\u201cThe Christian worldview comes out intellectually head and\nshoulders above its\ncompetitors.\u201d\nDr Craig will not respond to Richard Dawkins\nJoseph Letts\n7\nFELIX Friday 04 november 2011\nFEATURE\nD\nr Craig, as I expected,\nwas an extremely charismatic man, and it is\neasy to see why so many\nare taken with his ideas.\nThis charisma, along with his general\nintelligence, makes him an extremely\nskilled debater. As with many skilled\ndebaters, however, he often (in my opin-ion) seems to rely on style rather than\nsubstance to win debates. His capacity\nas an orator introduces extraneous information which seems to hide some of\nthe frailties of his arguments. There are\ncountless responses to Dr Craig\u2019s main\narguments to be found on the internet\n(Google is your friend), so, for now,\nI am only going to critique the main\npoints that Dr Craig presents during this\nparticular interview.\nI can\u2019t resist a comment on Dr Craig\u2019s\nviews on both Christopher Hitchens\nand Sam Harris. All I can say is that if\nthese two men haven\u2019t studied religious\nphilosophy since the age of 11 or 12,\nthen, judging by the countless books\nthey have written on the subject, they\nmust have been the two smartest children that have ever lived. I\u2019m sure Dr\nCraig knows that these two men have\ntaken part in countless debates and discussion with religious apologists, and\nhave spent a great deal of their life dedicated to the study of the subject, and so\nI find his comments at best, curious, and\nat worst, facetious and unnecessarily\nspiteful.\nI would now like to look at Dr Craig\u2019s\nviews on the distinction between faith\nand evidence. \u201cReligious faith\u201d always\ncauses huge problems in debates such as\nthe ones in which Dr Craig participates,\nbecause it is such an ill-defined term. Dr\nCraig, in this interview, clearly advocates a system by which faith is gained\nonly when belief is achieved. Although\nnot all religious people will agree with\nthis, as \u201cfaith\u201d is seen by some as the\nonly justification needed for belief, it\ndoes seem to make sense to me. I think\nif every religious person adopted this\nsame system, then it would make rational debate and argument much more\nfruitful.\nDr Craig\u2019s view that only evidence\nshould light the path to belief means\nthat, presumably, if his evidence were to\nbe refuted, then his belief in God would\nbe lost. But it\u2019s not quite that simple.\nHe has, as he says a \u201cdouble advocate\u201d.\nHe has the external evidence, which\nhe concentrates on in debates, and \u201cinternal\u201d evidence which is, in his own\nwords, the \u201cinner witness of God\u2019s spirit\nto my own heart\u201d. Lets see if we can\u2019t\nexamine both these sets of evidence in\nturn and find out if they are sound.\nAs I said in my introduction, I\u2019m not\nhere to offer refutations to Dr Craig\u2019s\npieces of \u201cexternal\u201d evidence, both because it would need a lot more words\nthan I have at my disposal, and because\nthere are countless refutations available on the internet if you are interest-ed. However, it seems to me that these\npieces of evidence are made completely\nredundant by the fact that they are simply afterthoughts. It is the \u201cinternal\u201d evidence that has led Dr Craig to believe,\nnot the arguments that he so often professes (as he admits in this interview),\nand so he therefore can hold these arguments \u201clightly\u201d. They therefore seem\nrather pointless, as they didn\u2019t even\nconvince him in the first place; he has\nessentially started from a base of belief\nand then gone searching for evidence\nthat may back his viewpoint up, which\nis undoubtedly going to cloud his judge-ment. It is like someone travelling up to\nScotland already believing in the Loch\nNess monster, and then getting excited\nafter days of searching when they finally see the tip of a rock poking out of\nthe water.\nAlthough the internal advocate that Dr\nCraig bases his beliefs upon is beyond\nexamination, it does certainly bring up\nwhat I think is a major problem with\nreligious belief, in that it is only made\npossible by the unfaltering solipsism of\nman. What I mean by this is that we erroneously tend to rely on our own feelings while negating the feelings of others without any real justification other\nthan that these feelings belong to us. If\nyou asked a hundred different religious\npeople about what they feel about God,\nyou would get one hundred different an-swers. And yet every single one of them\nwill value their own \u201cinternal\u201d evidence\nabove that of the other 99.\nWhat will Dr Craig say, for example,\nabout a Muslim who knows, through\nhis own internal advocate, that Allah is\nthe one true God? Why is this person\u2019s\ninternal evidence not equally as compelling to Dr Craig as his own? Furthermore, what would Dr Craig say about\nthe \u201cinternal evidence\u201d of someone who\nstrongly felt that they had been abducted by aliens? Or had psychic powers? I\nhave no doubt that Dr Craig would cast\nthese aside as ridiculous cases, and yet\nhe has complete confidence in his internal feelings. This is, in my opinion,\none of the great failings with religious\nbelief. Too much emphasis is placed on\nwhat we \u201cfeel\u201d rather than what the evidence points to.\nI could speak at a lot greater length\nabout Dr Craig, but unfortunately I have\nto stop, a little abruptly, here. I would\nencourage those of you who are interested to watch one of the many youtube\nvideos that Dr Craig mentions in the\ninterview to see him in action and hear\nsome rebuttals to his main arguments.\nLet me thank the organisers of the interview too for giving me the opportunity\nto conduct this interview, and, of course,\nDr Craig for giving up his time.\nCommentary\n\n"
