For its\ncomplete length of 2 miles\nthis raised motorway is\ncreating beneath itself a strip of land which is often\nseveral times the width of\nthe road above. Yet neither\nKensington nor Westminster\ncouncils had any development plans for this space,\nwhich is to be rented to\nthem by the G.L.C. Under pressure Kensington is agreeing to incorporate\nseveral ideas such as a small\npark, adventure playground,\nand meals on wheel depot,\nwhich were included in a plan drawn up by a local\npressure group. Nothing\nsimilar is being organised in\nWestminster; yet there is\neven more space under their\nhalf of the motorway. (The\nphoto shows the thinnest\nportion in Westminster).\nImperial College students,\nunlike the tenants of the new\ncouncil estate which runs\nalong the motorway have no\ncause to fear the borough\ncouncil. And, as members\nof the best known centre for\nscience and technology in\nthe country, their ideas on\nthe full exploitation of raised\nmotorways in an urban setting would carry considerable weight.\nAs a preliminary show of\nconcern it is intended to\npropose a motion at the next\nUnion meeting (November\n13th) deploring the unimaginative attitude of Westminster Council. This will\nthen need to be followed up\nby a development plan for\nthe mile long site and the\n'selling' of this to council-lor s, social workers, news-papers, M.P.'s etc.\nWith completion of the\nmotorway expected during\nnext year any further delay\nin forming a pressure group\nwill inevitably result in a council decision to cover\nthe whole area in grass or\nconcrete. So come to the\nUnion Meeting on November 13th and vote for this\nmotion.\nsitar-in Q.&G. Spree\ne Indian Society has\nThe Indian Society has\narranged an evening of\nIndian classical music on\nthe 10th November. Indian\nmusic is a melody and, to\nbe quiet honest, one cannot\nreally describe or explain\nit. It is something that must\nbe heard and experienced.\nProlonged effort has\nresulted in the many melodic\nstructures of Ragas. A Raga\nis a distinct personification\nof various moods. Meditational technique enables the\nmusician to enter into i the mood of the particular\nRaga, and play it success-fully.\nPERSIAN\nThe Sitar, the most\npopular Indian string in s tru ment, was invented by a Persian poet-musician, Amir\nKusrau, and was introduced\nto India in 1200 A.D. The number of strings\nand their tuning can differ\nand is a characteristic of\nthe school of music to which\nthe artist belongs.\nA typical programme of\nIndian music, vocal or in-s tru mental, can last anything\nup to 8 hours. I have listened\nto Ravi Shankar in Bombay\nfor 1\\ hours, playing with\ntremendous concentration and devotion in and open-air theatre, when a sweet\nbreeze from the sea continuously mingled with the\ndelicacy of his music to\ncreate a spiritual at mo sphere. It is an experience\nthat will give me joy, and\nsimply joy, all my life.\nANIL DATE.\nThe second Guilds union meeting of the term held on\nTuesday of last week was rather poorly attended, there being a noticeable lack of second and third year Guildsmen.\nThe result of this was the passing of a motion declaring that\nif the publicity officer did not succeed in producing an attendance of two hundred or more for the next meeting he\nwould be removed to the Round Pond and washed clean\nof his sins.\nThe meeting open, the secretary gabbled through the\nminutes of the previous meeting after removing the pencil\nfrom between his teeth, though judging from what one could\nhear this was unnecessary.\nConcerning Morphy Day the president announced that\nan official invitation would be sent to R. C.S.U. challenging\nthem to a tug of war on the towpath at Putney. Should this\ninvitation not be accepted a coffin containing the remains of\nR. C.S.U. will be ceremoniously consigned to the river bot-tom.\nThe meeting was informed of the results of the previous\nSaturday's collection in the form of at idd ley Winks race\ndown Oxford Street for this year's charity. The seventy or\nso Guildsmen who turned up raised some \u00a381.\nPhil Smythe then proposed a motion that a protective s machine should be installed in Mech. Eng. Dennis Taylor\nspoke against this appealing to all men, women and Children\nof Guilds to solve the problem by other means. Despite the\nsuggestion that the machine should be installed in the coffee\nroom and disguised as a coffee machine the motion was defeated by 36 votes to 31, a large number of people abstain-ing.\nThere being no other business the meeting was closed\nwith the usual rendering of Boomalaka and with the unusual\nsight of D. Taylor actually succeeding in lifting Bolt.\nLinstead selection\nAt a meeting of the Linstead Hall Committee last\nweek it was decided to increase the number of students on the Hall selection\ncommittee to six. Three of\nthese will be Linstead Hall\nresidents and the remaining\nthree will be from other\nHalls. It was also recommended that the number of\nstudents allowed in for a second year be reduced to\n10%.\nSparkes Flies at B.O.S. 'They are a load of idle\nlay about s!\" \u2014 \"Hobby sub-j ect s!\" So said Prof. Sparkes\n(Dean C.&G.) on students\nand Prof. Barrer (Head of\nChemistry) on non-specialist\nsubjects at a half hour discussion on diversification\npreceding the Board of\nStudies meeting on Wednesday 29 Oct. The discussion\nwas arranged at the request\nof the President and was attended by President Piers\nCorbyn, Academic Affairs\nOfficer \u2014 Brian Hains, one\nof the writers of the report\non Non-Technical Studies \u2014\nDave Wield, and two members who taught non-main\ncourse subjects: \u2014 Sinclair\nGoodlad (Elec. Eng.) and J. B.T. Cole (Chem. Eng.).\nThe President had requested\nbeforehand that they be allowed to stay for the board\nmeeting proper \"in the spirit\nof what was suggested in\nthe Rector's letter of 29th July\" but this request was\nnot granted.\nSTUDIES\nThe discussion was concerned with last term's student \"Report on NonTechnical Studies\" and a short memo by Piers\nCorbyn and Brian Hains on\ndiversification. The President\nintroduced the subject saying that there is growing\npressure and feeling (e.g. many govt, and other re-ports) from outside bodies\nin favour of extensive\ndiversification of both a \"science-genera list\" type and\na type to give \"an overall\nview of knowledge and promote a more critical socially\naware and socially responsible attitude\". Comparable\ninstitutions (e.g. MIT) have\nlong since diversified; the\nboard was asked \"Why is IC\nso far behind?\" In addition\nto this there is a very strong\nstudent opinion (according to\nlast term's pilot question-n aire) in favour of diversification. There are large discrepancies between departments in the present extent\nof diversification, which\npuzzles students; the board\nwas asked for the reasons\nfor discrepancies and to say\nwhat it intended to do about\nit. The memo to the board\nwas then outlined \u2014 it suggests strengthening the\ncourse unit structure and\nsetting up a college financed\n\"school\" to force diversification \u2014 and again they were\nasked by the President what\nthey intended to do about it.\nThe students felt that the\nresponse of the professors\nwas disappointingly illiberal\nand une on struct ive. Prof.\nBarrer (Chemistry) believed\nthat diversification would\nlead to a lowering in the\nscholarship and character of\nthe course, and described\ndiversification as \"hobby\nsubjects\" \u2014 which were for\nleisure time only. Prof.\nFlemming (Min. Tech.) was\nvery critical of the pilot\nquestionnaire itself. Prof.\nSparkes did not want\n\"hurried action\" and thought\nthat General Studies were\nquite adequate, the fact that\nmany students did not attend\nproved to him that they were\na \"lot of idle lay about s\". It\nwas suggested by someone\nwho went to the meeting\nthat as President of the\nRugger Club, Prof. Sparkes\nwould like to stop all Tuesday and Thursday practises\nto enable rug ger players to\nattend G.S. GO ELSEWHERE !\nProf. Alexander (Mech.\nEng.) thought that the students who wanted diversification should go elsewhere !\nMost other comments were\nunfavourable to diversification and the delegation of\nthree students and two staff\nfelt that too little time was\ngiven for reply or discussion.\nMany Profs, said they\nwanted more discussions\nlater. However after the\ndelegation of 3 students and\n2 staff left the discussion is\nrumoured to have improved,\nand it was decided that the\nPro-Rector should \"co-ordinate the present ar-range ment s, and by means\nof regular meetings with the\nstaff involved with these\nactivities explore what can\nbe done to meet the increasing demand for an extension\nof the non-technical Studies\nprovision within Ithe existing\nresources available (as was\nreported to the E.G. M.). Administrative support for his\nresponsibilities would be provided by the General Studies\noffice. It was also noted that\nproposals on the matter were\nbeing considered for the next\nquin que niu m. Some professors at the\nmeeting were sceptical about\nstudent support for the proposals but forward, so it\nwas fortunate that the\nE.G. M. the next day it was\npossible to overwhelmingly\nratify the memo to the\nBOST and make strong\ncomments on the subject\nwhich were relayed to the\nPro-Rector the very next\nday.\nLord Mayor's Show\n1\nThis year Guilds have\npersuaded (?) the organisers\nof the Lord Mayor's Show\nto let them have a float in\nthe pageant section of the\nprocession. The float will be\npreceded by 'Bo' and the\ntheme is \"Swinging London\", sponsored by the British Travel Association.\nThe float itself features a colourful and exciting 'bouti-que cum disco' with equally\ncolourful and exciting\nGuildswomen.\nOver the last weekend\nthe Evening Standard and\nNews took photographs of\nthe float in an incomplete\nstate (after an all-night\nattempt to get it ready. This\nwas cleverly disguised by\nnumerous strategically placed\npersons and Dermott Corr\ndoubling as Eros.\nThe floats will assemble\nin the Tower Bridge area on\nFriday afternoon, and are\nthen taken by police escort\nto London Wall, where they\nwill join the main procession\nat approx. 11.30 a.m. The Organisers stress that\nno Street collections be taken,\nand Guilds will be out in\nforce with collecting cans.\nAny Guildsman / woman\ninterested in selling programmes in the St. .Pauls\narea during the show should\ncall in at Guilds Union\nOffice as soon as possible\nbefore Nov. 8th.

The band struck up, the\nchoir too, and the procession started. Parents' eyes\ngazed approvingly on the entering student pro ces sion, well maybe they looked a trifle perplexed at\nPiers' and Butty's garb \u2014 their usual plus robes\nfor the occasion! Stupefied awe immediately replaced perplexity as the academic section slowly\nproceeded to the stage \u2014 two by two \u2014 in scarlet\ncape and squashed hat or mortar board. Such\ncolour jarred for an instant against the sobriety\nof the student body but soon all were happily\nseated and the fun commenced.\nKeith Guy performed well as student orator, one can't complain about his Latin pronoun cia tion, maybe he never\nlearnt Latin.\nLord Penney then gave his address. He talked of changes\nin structure, changes in relationships and changes specific\nto Imperial College, of growth in numbers, in buildings\nand facilities and growth points in academic and technical\nendeavour. Each group in I.C.'s community had, he said,\nbeen flexing its muscles and trying it on the rector. This last\nremark raising the first smile of the afternoon. Lord Penney\nstill didn't know how many students there are at I.C.3,950 he thinks, of whom 300 are women, he seemed sure of the\nnumber of women. We were treated to various facts and\nfigures. 40% of all our students are postgraduates, 22% of\nall students are from overseas. The academic staff number\n688. Lord Penney then talked of new chairs (not the seating\nkind) and of visiting Professors. Finishing this interesting\nlist he went back to making an address. With a deft but\nfriendly sentence he glossed over the student union mention-ing, and only mentioning, the words 'discipline' and 'appeals\nmachinery'. He did add however that by the end of this\nterm the last nine of the student houses would be ready for\noccupation; so that 1,100 student places would be available.\nA long and eloquent waxing followed on the Architectural\nAssociation, collaboration with the Royal Postgraduate\nMedical School at Hammersmith and of work shared with\nRothampstead Experimental Station. Bringing matters\nnearer home Lord Penney mentioned the recommendations\nof the National Libraries Committee affecting the Science\nMuseum Library (newly moved to College Block) and\nImperial College's Lyon Playfair Library. The principle\nbeing that they should be integrated and administered as a major central library by Imperial College. The matter is\nbeing considered ! The Rector closed with a few remarks\non the college's future as he envisaged it and a final passing\nremark for the poor unfortunates in the pit. The age group,\nhe said, of the young people who are today receiving their\ndiplomas 'will have an important voice in deciding nationally what we (i.e. the nation) are to do in the future'. Seeing\nthat these same students will by then be paying for the\neducation of their successors, Lord Penney said that T await\nthe day with the greatest possible interest'.\nHis interesting and sympathetic address over, the real\nraison-d'e tre of Commemoration Day started. With aplomb\nand discreet bowing the Deans of the various colleges\nannounced their respective numbers of associates. Groans\nwere quietly suppressed as it was gratefully realised that\nthese numbers far exceeded the number of students present.\nStill the whole rigmarole of walking across the platform,\nbowing (or curtseying if in I.C.'s main minority group) took\nquite long enough. The only relief for your intrepid correspondent was the sight of Piers Corbyn quietly contemplating\nhis Worker's Press during the whole process. The Associates\nover with, the choir relieved the gloom with a thoughtful\nrendition of Haydn's 'The Heavens are Telling'. Thoughtful\nin that it was well sung and not too long ! The choir actually\nwas one of the bright spots of the afternoon. After all the\nsight of so many mini-skirted singers certainly quelled the\ndesire to sleep for many in the pit.\nNow came the Diplomates. Six hundred and something\nof them, someone said. An audible groan this time. But the\nGods were with us. Only about one hundred were there to\nbe presented.\nProfessor Francis, the Staff Orator, then introduced and\ngave short and remarkably humorous accounts of the lives\nof the five new Fellows of the Imperial College. More\nmemorable of his remarks were those applied to His Excellency Andre J. Clasen \u2014 Ambassador of Luxembourg, who\nProfessor Francis described as 'Mines' best ever student'\n(pause for silence of disbelief) 'from Luxembourg'; and to the\nactivities of Mr. A.R.O. Williams whilst a member of the\nRowing Club back in 1926 \u2014 coaling locomotive tenders\nat Kings Cross during the General Strike. No comment.\nLord Nelson rose to address the throng. Expectation beat\nwithin most breasts for the pearls of wisdom about to fall\nfrom one of our leading industrialists \u2014 Fellow of Imperial\nCollege, Chairman of General Electric and English Electric\nCompanies Ltd. Perhaps we had been spoilt by Lord\nPenney's speech and the brilliant wit of Professor Francis.\nCollege Block Settles Down\nA special report by\nour CoUege Block\ncorrespondent\nAs I was walking\naround the college block\na few days ago I realised\nthat perhaps I was a little too harsh in my\ncriticism of the building\nin an earlier article. As\na result the place seems\nto have lost all interest\nin life and is already\nstarting to fall to pieces.\nThose locked doors I have\nfound are locked because\ntheir hinges have broken and\nthe chairs in the buttery\nwhich were already scarce\nnow seem to be disappearing\nand a pile of 'rubble' seems\nto be growing all the time.\nIt is a great pity that there\nwere no camera crews around\nthe buttery during the first\nfew weeks of term as they\nwould have obtained the perfect schools demonstration\nfilm of the formation of fold\nmountains in the floor (just\nby the till).\nIs Mooney planning to\ngrow his own spaghetti in the\njunior common room or is it\nthe heat for the benefit of the\nbotany department to study\ntropical plants ?\nThese, however, are minor\nfaults; as a whole the major\nproblems of the college block\nwere caused by opening it\nbefore it was really ready.\nAfter nearly a month the\nvarious major amenities in\ncentral site have settled down\nand ironed out their initial\ndifficulties.\nLower Refectory A publicity campaign has\nit seems educated most people\nin the use of the 'self-clear-ing' trays. The standard of\nthe food is, in general, good\ncompared with Southside,\nabout the same as the Union.\nThe queues are, except at the\nreally busy times just after\nthe end of lectures, reasonably short, and, there being\ntwo service areas, they are\nfast moving.\nin college but the variety of\nsandwiches is extremely\nlimited. The hours open have\nbecome rather more convenient (10.15 \u2014 11.15 a.m. es-pec i ally) but late in the afternoon (about 4.15 onwards)\nthe place is nearly deserted\n(which might cause a shortening of hours !).\nLibraries The Lyon-Playfair library\nnow covers three floors and\nhas a large number of tables\navailable for working until\n9.30 in the evening. The\nHaldane library now looks\nhuge compared to the old\none.\nMore about libraries in the\nnext issue.\nButtery( or Chippie) \u2014- Still the\nqueues are gigantic at lunch\ntime. The chips are the best\nMusic Library Compared to the old cub-by-hole' the new music lib- Bookshop ra ry is nothing short of lux-u riou s. Apart from the larger space available for the\ndisplay of record sleeves the\nlibrary now boasts two hi-fi\nstereo units. For those who\nrecognize terms there are two\nGarrard 401 decks with SME\narms and Shure magnetic\ncartridges. There are two\nLeak-70 amplifiers, two listening booths each equipped\nwith two Maxim speakers\nand a pair of stereo head-phones. Also in the record\nlibrary (as opposed to the\nbooths) there is a pair of\nTannoy Lancaster speakers.\nIn short a really superb set-up. This is primarily for the\nuse of those who haven't got\na quality record player them-selves. There is just one\npuzzling feature : with an\noutlay of about \u00a3500 (based\non current prices for all the\npieces bought separately) it\nwould be reasonable to see\na 'dust-bug' on each deck\n(total cost \u00a32.4.6) to ensure\nthat the records are completely cleaned.\nThe service is much\nquicker now, as the staff\ndon't have to spend quite so\nmuch time searching for\nbooks. Also a larger range\nof stationery is now avail-able.\nThe content of the speech was mildly absorbing (I make this\nremark after re-reading it afterwards, only with difficulty\ncould I keep awake during its rendition). However we can\nonly presume that His Lordship's boardroom delivery far\nexcels his public oratory. He spoke of the ever expanding\ntechnological knowledge in the world, of the need for\ntechnology of markets for firms. In fact a standard commemoration day dry technology orientated talk. Enough\nsaid.\nThe choir led, indeed, sung alone, the National Anthem,\nand we all filed out to the waiting cameras of proud mums\nand dads. For the supremely uninformed, Commemoration\nDay exists according to the student orator's proclamation to\ncommemorate the visit of King George VI in 1945. Maybe\nwe'll have two a year after the Queen's visit to open College\nblock in November. Ah well it was only a thought!\nConkers Hit by Rain\nRain hit R.C.S.' s first\nattempt to collect\nmoney for carnival\nSaturday last, cutting\ndown an expected turn\nout of about 40 to 12. It\nwas raining so hard that\nat one time the whole\nprocession was almost\nabandoned, till Motor\nClub and Jez arrived\nand were talked into\ngoing for a ride, taking\na few conker s and tins,\nto see what happened.\nA wet ride followed, and\nseveral soggy, conker wielding students dismounted in\nKensington High Street to\nconfront the local public.\nThe original idea was to\nsell conker s to the public.\nAs a parting thought on\nthe college block, why is it\nthat an I.C. student stands\nmore chance of seeing the\nstate opening of Parliament\nthan the state opening of the\ncollege block ?\nand have a fight with them,\nbut it was supposed to be\non the more leisurely Kings\nRoad, which, of course,\nwould have been deserted in\nthe wet. Unfortunately the\npeople on High Street were\nshopping, intent on getting\nto wherever they were rush-ing, and only the occasional\none stopped for a fight. Even\nso, we often got 2 or 3 bob\nfor a conker and Jez, surrounded by several conker\nplaying students is quite an\nattraction. At one time a policeman, after looking on\ninterested ly for a few min u tes, was almost talked into\nbuying a conker.\nSo, what appeared to be a drastic failure early on became a reasonable after-noon's collection, realising\n\u00a330.3.5, three halfpennies and\none U.S. cent out of ten tins,\nwith two tins yet to be found.\n\n"

It is\nworth considering, therefore, at the beginning of the year the\neffect that will be felt at IC particularly in the field of sport.\nAlthough no-one will deny that the very fine facilities we have\nhere should be shared with other colleges so that as many\nstudents as possible can have use of them, I feel 'that care\nmust be taken to ensure that the original users, i.e. IC^students, do not suffer merely for the sake of sharing: as might\nhappen, for example, if one particular facility was to be over-used, which would obviously be to everyone's detriment.\nOne Sided\nAlthough the other colleges in the area have much to offer\nin a wide range of fields, they have little to offer to sportsmen\nat IC, many of whom feel that reciprocal arrangements are\nrather one-sided. In many cases it is the captains of individual\nclubs who are being asked to cater for USK students and\nthe difficulties involved here are, perhaps, not widely realised.\nOne of the biggest headaches any captain has to cope with\nis knowing whether or not a particular player is available for\nselection, and it is difficult enough to find whether a student\nat IC is available without having to look for people at other\ncolleges. It must also be noted that most IC clubs enter teams\nin UL leagues, in which players from outside IC are not\nallowed to compete. No sensible captain will try to build up\na team knowing that it will have to be changed for a league\ngame.\nOther Universities\nIt is worth considering here, the way sport is run in large\nprovincial universities, most of which run sport not on an\nabsolutely centralized basis but generally on a departmental\nbasis. This is in many cases simply because the numbers to\nbe catered for are too large for any one club to deal with.\nIf, therefore, too many USK students are invited to join IC\nclubs, the clubs will eventually become unmanageable and\nthe respective sports will have to be run on collegiate basis,\nthus defeating the whole idea of USK.

Georgian, Susan Thompson, S. Donald, Rosanne\nDate, P. Poyser, Fiona Mackinnon (capt.).\nLast Saturday, 24th, the ladies Badminton team started\ntheir season with a good and close match against Kings\nCollege, winning 5\u20144 at our home ground, Latimer Baths,\nat Wimbledon.\nTeam: L. Beynon, R. Date, S. Thompson, F. Mackinnon\n(capt.), P. Ryall, H. Hutchin.\nHockey\nThe ladies Hockey team is going from strength to strength\nby beating Goldsmiths College, our opponents in last year's ULU Knockout Tournament Trial, 3\u20142 at Harlington on\nWednesday, 29th October. The first half showed our team to\nbe very disorganised with Goldsmiths leading 2\u20140 at half-time. However, after a strong pep talk; from the captain, we\nfinally won 3\u20142.\nTeam: J. Buzzard, S. Edwards, J. Mansfield, S. Inskip,\nM. Lewis, H. Hutchin, J. Allinson, S. Thompson, L. Beynon,\n(capt.), M. Paluch, M.

We Started the season in fine\nstyle with a2 \u20141 win over Royal Free Hospital and narrowly\nlost the two other matches, 1\u20142 against the Land Registry\n(who were obviously more used to the bumps on their pitch\nthan we were!) and 2\u20143 against Q.E.

Despite being\non top for most of the game,\nthe team had great difficulty\nin finding goal. The whole\nteam ran well, on a hard,\nslippery surface, but the score\nremained 0\u20140 despite i the ball staying in the UC half\nfor nearly the whole of extra\ntime.\nOn Wednesday the 1st continued their league success by\nbeating LSE 2\u20140. The fact\nthat both goals came from\nthe last 5 minutes showed the\ndifficulty the* side was having\nin scoring goals. This was a good win for the team, who\nnow face UC in the cup replay on Saturday, November 1st. The second XI lost 5\u20141\nagainst LSE II. It is difficult\nto see why such a good sat of\nplayers are not having much\nsuccess at the present. After\na good start to the season\nbeating St. Mary's and Pembroke the team has lost 8\u20141\nto Bristol II as well as LSE !\nA good win against UC is\nneeded on Saturday to get\nback to form.\nAfter winning 11 \u2014 4\nagainst UC the IV continue\ntheir winning run by beating\nLSE 4\u20142.\nNote.

London Technical College, on Friday 17th, being\nwon by a mixed ls it and 2nd team. On the following Sunday a double match was\nplayed at home against Borough Road College 1st and\n2nd teams. This resulted in a3 sets to 2 win against their\nIst team and 3 : 0 win against\ntheir seconds.\nThe first real test for a strong Ist team took place\non Sunday 26th, in a Southern Area Tournament at\nBracknell. We were unfortunate to be under seeded and\nhad to play the first match in\nour pool against Preston, a National League team playing by invitation. We took an\nearly lead but they discovered\nsome weakness and soon we\nlost co-ordination and were\nsoundly beaten. After a quick\ntactical talk we continued\ninto the consolation event\nand won it easily. With the\nunderstanding built up in the\ntournament it is hoped to\nshow we have i the strongest\nteam in the history of Volleyball at I.C., and also to\nattempt to test our abilities\nagainst many other British\nUniversities,\nCHARLES ORTON\nCould YOU take an action sports photo?

The ruc king of the forwards and i the running of the backs are particularly good.\nIC scored directly from the kick-off, and throughout the\nmatch gave no quarter although some loose tackling by the\nback row let the Royal Free backs in for their solitary try.\nOur 9 tries were scored by : Roy Anderson (2), Mike Adams\n(2), John Gardiner, John Ballard, John Kelly, Keith Devaney,\nand Bob Atkins. Two conversions were kicked by Dave\nDevlin.\nOther team members: Alan Roberts, Terry Stephenson,\nAndy Clark, Pete Earl, George Widelski, Steve Owens and\nDave Barford.\nOn Saturday IC had a block fixture against Rosslyn Park\nto which all sides, with the exception of the irrepressible A3\nXV, went down rather heavily. Although losing to bigger and\nbetter sides, the scores could have been far more decent if\nselected players had turned up to play, and had not crossed\noff after 6 p.m. on Friday evening! If the club is to prosper\n'this season, some concrete club spirit must be built up \u2014\neven though some sacrifices from players may be necessary.\nMIKE ADAMS\nRCS Sixes\nThe RCS Soccer Sixes competition was held on Sunday,\n26th October. Fourteen teams\nturned out under a variety of\nnames, e.g. the dogger s, Fairies, and Lepers, but even\nso support was less than i had\nbeen hoped for.\nAfter the first rounds had\nbeen played, the semi-finals\nset the Maths 3 first team\nagainst some PG's from Physics while the Chemistry 2\nfirst team came up against\nthe Hyde Park Casuals, a rather casual 'bunch from\nPhysics,\nThe results of these games\nproduced the not unexpected\nfinal between Maths 3 and\nChem 2. /'\nMaths took the lead fairly\nearly in the game, but it was\nnot long until the equalise r from Chem 2, after a defensive error. As half time drew\nrapidly near, a beautiful cross\nshot from Maths' wing\nwhizzed past the Chemistry\ngoalkeeper. In the second\nhalf, there were several incidents in both penalty areas,\nand about half way through\nthe half Chemistry scored\nfrom a disputed penalty.\nShortly before the end they\ntook the lead, which they\nwere able to maintain despite\nJudo\nOn Saturday, 25th October,\na team of five went down to\nSouthampton for a contest\nagainst Reading and Southampton. Despite i the small\nsize of the team, they managed to beat Reading by 25\npts. to 15, and only just lost\nto Southampton by 27 pts.\nto 20.\nThere are several important fixtures coming up soon,\nand the club would like more\nmembers, both beginners and\ngraded, especially those Who\nput their names down on\nFreshers' Day.

The result is below; it concerns everyone training to be a scientist or engineer and is a balanced observation on the scientists role in society.\nThere is much talk at\npresent about 'social\nresponsibility in the\nsciences'; the 'scientists'\nlack of conscience';\nassociated with which\nwe have the so-called\n'crisis of the city' and\nthe growth of the 'tech-no logical jungle'.\nScientists and technologists have been singled out\nby the public as chief\nculprits in the 'rape of the\nenvironment'; pollution of\nthe eco sphere is slow mass\nsuicide we're told, and you,\nthe b of fins are leading it.\nEven concerned scientists\nare predicting an early doom\nfor mankind as a direct result of the tampering of their\nfellows with natural processes that aren't understood.\nWhat are the foundations\nfor this outburst of opinion?\nWell, to take some general\ncategories, we have pollution\nof the air, of the waters, and\nlately thermal pollution has\nbeen realised to be as inherently dangerous to the environment and life in general\nas the other two. More\nspecifically, 'scientific' farming practices are said to\nhave already upset certain\nbiological cycles due to the\nexcessive and indiscriminate\nuse of nitrate fertilisers and\ncaused such an accumulation\nof DDT in some species of\nwild life that it has now\nbeen outlawed as a major\ndanger to seagulls and fish\nin the U.S.A. where it was\nonce the panacea for all\nthe farmers pest problems.\nThere should be no doubt\nto anyone with eyes that a problem, possibly a very\nserious one, exists and is\nescalating in the fact of in-difference. What then can we\ndo, as future (or present)\nscientists and technologists,\nabout this state of affairs?\nI suggest that, for a start,\nwe introduce a new concept\ninto the game of technology.\nWe must recognize that the\nnatural environment has\nsome intrinsic value. So why\nnot ascribe a monetary\nvalue to the eco sphere and\nregard it as part of your\ntechnological capital. Thus\nwhen you come to design,\nsay, a chemical works, raising the level of pollution\nin the atmosphere would be\nequivalent to destroying\nsome part of the eco sphere and the cost of this section\nof eco sphere would be a part of the capital costs of.\nthe project. Now, you are\nin a position where you can\nweigh up the profits to be\ngained by raising the\nmaterial 'quality of life'\nagainst the corresponding\ndecline in the life-supporting\ncapacity of the eco sphere. Perhaps it would be profitable to keep the population\npermanently on the brink of\nchoking to death if this\nstimulated sufficient demand\nfor your air-purifying units.\nThe possibilities are bound-less. And you would be\nsecure in the knowledge that\nall your pet projects would\neventually become possible\nas the fall in value of the\neco sphere( due to capital\ndepreciation at 6% p.a.) reduced the cost of destroying\nit.\nPlanning Utopia\nBut this is frivolous. The\npoint I'm trying to make is\nthat there is little consideration given to the importance\nof maintaining our environment (when did you last\nhave a lecture (in Engineering) which emphasised this\naspect rather than the\neconomic aspect of a pro-j ect?). Material criteria are\nno longer sufficient in determining the direction to be\ntaken through the multiplicity of possibilities open to\nus in technology and an improvement in the material\nstandard of living no longer\nseems to be such a self-evident virtue. The stage has\nbeen reached where we can\nbegin to, need to, 'plan our\nUtopia' (Marcuse). To do\nthis we need to look at our\nsubjects not only in isolation but also as part of\nsociety and question our\nroles in the society.\nKant, a while ago, expressed this problem in the\nterms relevant for his era\nwhen the search for 'pure\nknowledge' was a perfectly\nacceptable role.\n'To yield to every whim\nof curiosity, and to allow\nour passion for enquiry to be\nrestrained by nothing but\nthe limits of our ability, this\nshows an eagerness of mind\nnot unbecoming to scholar-ship. But it is wisdom that\nhas the merit of selecting\nfrom among the innumerable\nproblems that present them-selves, those whose solution\nis important to mankind'.\nNow all I can see at IC,\nand all that is taught seems\nto me only to lead to the\nblind application of arbitrary criteria without any\nconsideration to their place\nin the gestalt; to lead in fact\nto producing individuals\nwhom Kant might describe\nas foolish scholars.\nAm I wrong? I hope so.\n3W1 Again Academic Affairs\n\"The world will face a major hunger and unemployment crisis in the next 15\nyears unless rich countries\ndrastically change their\nagricultural and trade poli-cie s\". This is the warning theme\nof a report issued this month\nby the United Nations Food\nand Agricultural Organisation. Yet the crisis is already\nwith us with 80% of the\nworld's population starving,\nwhilst we, the rich 20%, sit\nback in our profit-craving\nwestern economic system,\nand watch the poor become\npoorer. Foreign 'aid' given\nby Britain and most other\nwestern capitalist countries,\nmore often means private investment so that nice fat\nreturns are made. Thus instead of the third world\ncountries becoming richer,\ntheir economy remains static\nwhilst their resources of raw\nmaterials are exploited for\ngain, to go straight into the\npockets of the rich investors.\nThus the gap between the\nrich and the poor countries\ngrows, as it has done in the\npast decade.\nIn mediaeval England, it\nwas the poor who paid the\ntaxes, and the rich who received them, whilst the \"com-pens ation\" paid to the\npeasants was the privilege of\nowning a small plot of land,\nand the privilege to work\non the vast Squires' land, at\nas low a wage as he could\npossibly pay them, without\ntheir starving to death.\nTo me there is a great\nsimilarity between the local\nfeudal system of Britain's Dark Ages, and the worldwide feudal system of the\n20th Dark Age.\nThe ultimate aim of 3W1 is not simply to raise money\ntowards O A., but to urge\nthe government to modify\nand increase its O. A. pro-gram me, eventually to\nattain the target set by the\nUnited Nations of giving 1 %\nof our gross national\nproduct, (0.42% at the\nmoment), and to give it in\na way that does not ask for\nlarge returns. We are therefore asking students to give\n1 % or more of their annual\nincome to O. A., and by the\ntime that 30,000 students are\ndoing this, it will become a considerable political force,\nand also a large financial\nsource. Already over \u00a31,000\nhas been raised in I.C. If yen\nwish to give or to help,\nplease contact me.\nJOHN THOMASON\nOn Tuesday, October 21,\nthe Imperial College\nAcademic Affairs Committee\nheld its first meeting. To\ncelebrate this momentous\noccasion, it was decided to\nelect Mike Walton (RSM\nAcad. Off.) to the posts of\nSecretary, Treasurer and\nGeneral Dogsbody of the\nCommittee.\nThe purpose of the meeting was twofold. Firstly, it\nwas to discuss the co-or dina tion of academic affairs\nwithin Imperial College, and\nsecondly, to formulate a number of general policies.\nSome administrative changes\nwere introduced to streamline the workings of the\ndifferent academic com-mitte es, the most important\nbeing that specific people\nnow have responsibilities for\nspecific jobs.\nThe field of Audio-Visual\nAids is looked after by Tom\nWoosnam (Union Rep). This\nmeans that he is concerned\nwith the collecting and collation of information on these\nAids, \" with particular\nreference to their potential\napplication in the undergraduate teaching at IC.\nJudith Walker (Union Rep)\nwill be following with interest the development of the\ncourse unit system, whereas\nthe whole gamut of Vacation Training falls under the\nhands of Harald Marshbaum\n(Guilds Acad. Off.).\nOne of the major purposes\nof the Committee is to\nassist the general process of\nfeedback from the student\nbody to the staff. It is hoped\nthat this will be done through\nthe cooperation of the\nnewly elected IC Department Reps. We also hope\nthat both staff and administration will see the Commitee as a means of sounding out student opinion in a speedy and accurate manner.\nWe have every desire to\nwork in full cooperation\nwith the staff and administration towards the building of\nan academic community.\nThe report on the Conference on Learning and\nTeaching was read out, from\nwhich I should now like to\nquote. \"The most basic long-term suge sti on is that each\nDepartment should be encouraged to examine its\nobjectives in teachings in its\nown field, to consider\nwhether its present methods\nare the best suited to those\nobjectives and to decide\n^whether its methods of\nINFORMATION\nMUSIC. The entertainments committee hope to maintain a good standard in groups at the Saturday night dances this\nyear. Those booked for the rest of this term are:\nNovember 8th Blossom Toes and Alexander Patton\nNovember 15th Edgar Broughton Band\nNovember 22nd Prince Edward's Magic Theatre\nNovember 29th Deep Purple\nDecember 6th Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band\nOn November 28th East of Eden and the Battered\nOrnaments will be playing at the R.C.S. Carnival.\nSCHOLARSHIPS: If you think you might like a period of\nstudy at an overseas university the British Council publishes\na booklet giving details of 200 awards tenable at foreign\nuniversities by British Students. The British Council,' State\nHouse, High Holborn, London WC1.\nBOOKS: It is sometimes nice to put aside all the heavy\nreading and look at something simple. A good place for\nthis is The Children's Book Centre in Kensington Church\nSt. They have a really wide selection of books which enable\nyou, for a short time anyway, to recapture your childhood.\nMayflower paperbacks are shortly bringing out a paper\nbacked version of Alice in Wonderland with the original\nillustrations for only 5/-.\nJUMBLE SALES: Jumble Sales can be a very enjoyable\nway of spending a Saturday afternoon. Look in local papers\nlike the Kensington news for details.\nPUBLICATIONS: If you've always wanted to be a writer\nor get your thoughts into print there is ample opportunity\nin the college.\nBEENO is produced by the college arts group HENRY. It\nis produced on an occasional basis, only coming out when\nsomeone feels like putting it out. It contains poetry, stories,\narticles drawings and photographs by people in the college,\nbut unlike Phoenix it contains everything submitted; there\nis no editorship. Go to a Henry meeting if you would like\nsomething in.\nCEFE \u2014 stands for coming events, future events, it is produced weekly by the left wing political societies. It provides\ncomment on things happening in college and gives notice of\nfuture happenings. It is distributed free to anyone who\nwants it. Send your name and department to Mike Muller\n458 Tizard Hall. Anyone is welcome to help write it on\nThursday evenings in 458 Tizard. CEFE is worth reading\neven if you aren't politically minded, since it usually contains\ninteresting pieces of college news which don't find their way\ninto Felix.\nFELICITY is the Felix late news produced on the Wednesday preceding Felix publication day by Tony Kirkham and\nJohn Bowman whom you should contact if you have some\nlast minute news.\nFELIX you know about, people are always needed to write\nfeatures and reports and to root out news. Come to a press\nmeeting on Tuesday or Thursday lunchtime or contact\nMalcolm Williamson, in Linstead Hall, Room 634.\nGuilds newsletter is one of the constituent college news-sheets. These contain constituent college union news and\nare usually available from year reps., information about\nwriting for them can be obtained in the relevant union\noffices, or from Eric Rossiter, for Mines, Howard Matthews,\nChem., for RCS.\nPHOENIX is published twice a year and contains a selection of poetry, articles, photography and so on by people\nin the college. Contributions should be sent to Chris Lewis\nin Linstead.\nassessment really test the\noverall attainment of its\nobjectives. Such encouragement could probably only\ncome successfully from the\nBoard of Studies.\" It is important to realise that the\nBoard of Studies control the\nreal power in the academic\naffairs of this college. For\nthis reason it is imperative\nthat we have some representation on the Board. Unfortunately, however, progress\nin this direction has not been\naltogether satisfactory.\nA further suggestion from\nthe report was that the\nAcademic Affairs Officers\nshould report periodically to\nthe Deans Committee. In\nthis respect, the Deans are\nthe \"opposite numbers\" of\nthe Academic Officers, hence\nany consultation with them\nwould be of considerable\nvalue. We intend to pursue\nthis suggestion in the very\nnear future.\nAfter one hour and eleven\nminutes the meeting closed\n(How's that for a Council\nCommittee?), the next Hains\nand Walton Laugh-In being\nscheduled for Tuesday,\nNovember 25. Anyone interested in having an\nacademic affair is cordially\ninvited to come along!\nBRIAN HAINS\n\n"

Send them to \"Odds and Sods\", Felix, Union\nBuilding, preferably 10 days before publication, and\ncertainly at least 8 days before.\nPius\nPontification\nIt would seem that\nponti fi cation on the\nsubject of scientists' responsibility is all the rage\nat IC at the moment.\nUnfortunately the approach is usually along\nthe lines of \"We should\nnot do this; it may have\nunfortunate spin-offs\".\nThis, I feel, is the wrong\napproach. It would be\nfar more practical for\nthe scientist to say\nsay \"here is a problem,\nwhat can I do about it?\"\nThis would be a responsible attitude.\nTo give a specific case,\nevery scientist is well aware\nof the population explosion\non this planet. We cannot\nfeed the people we already\nhave, yet we persist in\nbreeding like rabbits. Every\neffort to control this is held\nback by lack of doctors, lack\nof drugs and the vastness of\nthe problem. Then, on top\nof this, we have blind religious superstitions and\nignorance telling some of the\nworst culprits that they\nshould not effectively control their breeding.\nWhat is needed is a birth\ncontrol system that the most\nignorant and unwilling can\nuse. Obviously with a problem of this magnitude we\ncan not only have voluntary\nbirth control, we need something which must be taken\nwilling or not. Such a contraceptive would either have\nto be airborne or in water\nsupplies. Here, a pill would\nbe needed to have children;\nthis alone would stop unwanted pregnancies. Then,\nby allowing each couple\nonly two children we could\nreduce the population to a manageable size. This would\npossibly restrict liberty, but\nsurely it would be a small\nprice to pay to end this\nsenseless breeding.\n\"Pius X\" To define anarchism\nis impossible. This is entailed in its very concept\n\u2014 anarchy is freedom,\nthe freedom of the individual \u2014 anarchism is\nthe expression of each\nfree individual's ideas\nand, since no two\npeople's ideas are the\nsame, no strict definition of anarchism can\nbe obtained.\nThe requirement of\nanarchy is the removal of all\nauthority, of that God-given\nright some men and all states\nseem to think they have to\norder and direct their fellow\nmens' lives.\nThe gaining of this freedom will entail the collapse\nof both capitalist and communist systems, freeing\npeople from their efficient\nstate-run lives. This may\nseem a fearful prospect to\npeople who have had their\nability to think and make\ntheir own decisions removed\nor made redundant by state\npropaganda and decision-making machinery.\nIf this dependence of\nhuman beings not on themselves or on one another but\non an amorphous bureau-c racy, the state, is not fright-e ning, then its methods of\nobtaining your dependence\nupon it must be.\nState conditioning, while\nit has not yet reached the\nefficiency of \"Brave New\nWorld\" is the greatest\nthreat to individual freedom.\nIts aim is to convince people\nof the need for a central\ncontrolling authority and\nthat without this no form of\n\"civilised\" (sic) society could\nexist. People brought up in\nthis atmosphere c once ed their powers of thought and\ndecision to the state, and\nthen allow the state to increase its power by removing any freedom they have\nleft under the guise of \"pro-tec tion of the society\". Finally the only freedom remaining will be the freedom\nto obey the state. People will\nno longer be human beings,\nbut will be mere slaves of\nthe state.\nAnarchism, no matter\nwhat form (mutualism,\nanarcho-communism, etc), is\nfundamentally opposed to all\nauthority. It envisages a society built on co-operation,\nnot coercion, people organising themselves by voluntary\nagreement. It envisages production for the needs of\npeople, not production returning a profit to the few.\nIt envisages freedom.\nTom Casey (Phys I)Y. H.A. Weekend\nLast Friday (24th) at\n5 p.m. a coach load of\n31 people waited outside IC Union for the\n32nd. They were ready\nto commence the first\nICYHA weekend of the\nyear.\nLater that night, that very\nsame coach de voided itself of\nits load outside a large\nstudded door, which was the\nentrance to the castle of St.\nBriavel's in Gloucestershire.\nThe castle is in fact the Youth\nHostel and although jj arts of\nthe present building date\nback to the 12th century, the\naccommodation was by no\nmeans primitive and a cheery\nwarden and good food helped\nall the more to make the\nstay a pleasant one.\nOn the Saturday, the party\nsplit into various groups,\nmost of whom went down the\nRiver Wye (Tintern Abbey\nseemed the main objective),\nonly to regret it when faced\nwith the climb up to the hostel in the evening. Luckily\nthere was a pub next door to\nprovide entertainment.\nOn Sunday most people\ntried an easier walk; in the\noppressive temperatures of\nthe day no-one was keen to\nexert themselves. As the day\nwore on, and a few more\npubs fell to the adventurous,\nLondon's noise and fumes\ngrew nearer. The four o 'clock\ndeadline was met promptly,\nand we hope people enjoyed\nthemselves enough to try the\nnext trip.\nAlthough chess is\noften thought of in the\npopular imagination as\nan old man's game, a very large proportion of\nthose who play competitively are under 25.\nThis means that virtually all the Universities and Colleges in the\ncountry have a chess\nteam, and IC is no ex-ce pti on. The IC Chess club meets\nevery lunch-time in the room\nopposite the Halls of Residence Office, at the top of\nthe spiral concrete staircase\nopposite Southside main en-trance, and shares quarters\nwith the Bridge Club. Membership stands at about 60,\nroughly 50 per cent of whom\nare active members of one\nof our teams, and the rest\nprefer to play just the occasional lunch-time friendly\ngame.\nTwo IC teams play in the\nUL League, the first in the\nPremier Division (of which\nwe are champions) and the\nsecond in the First Division.\nTeams are 8 a side, and\nmatches take place approximately once a fortnight.\nThere is, in addition, a knockout competition known\nas the Pugh Cup (which\nname should not be said too\nquickly), in which both\nteams compete.\nIC is the only London\nCollege to enter a team, in\nfact two teams, in the London League.

The second team was\nvery unlucky here, defaulting a crucial match before\nthe fixture list arrived!\nWith the end of last term,\nseveral of the best players\nleft College, and although an\ninflux of fresher s has\nbrought the second team up\nto strength, the first team is\nconsiderably weakened, and\nmay have difficulty preventing the drop into the London\nC Division.\nThe first team has, in fact,\nmade a rather hesitant start.\nOn Friday, 17th October\nthey played Camden Town\nin a match, as yet unfinished,\nwhich may end up in an IC\nvictory, whilst on Friday\n24th they played Streatham\nin another unfinished match\nwhich looks like it will be\nlost.\nThe second team opened\non Monday, 13th October,\nagainst Atheneum IV, and\nwon convincingly 6\\ to 3^,\ndespite losing two boards on\ndefault.

Perhaps it is as well to know\nfrom the outset just what the position of the authorities is,\nand to build our case up from an understanding of this\nposition.\nIt is important to remember that those professors who\nspoke all have the same reactionary opinion on represent a tion; an opinion which is not necessarily held by the Board\nas a whole. In fact following the meeting with the student\nrepresentatives, the professors who spoke were castigated by\nother members of the Board for their ill-mannered and unfounded attack on diversification. It would seem that this\nattack was planned by the few members who did speak, and\nanother valid point is that many of the more progressive\nelements of the Board were not in attendance at the meeting.\nThe tone of this meeting shou d not, therefore, de moral is e those who feel that adequate representation is ultimately\nattainable. Instead, they should remember that the reactionaries have done nothing but harm their case by their ill-manner reception of the students at the Board of Studies.\nPresident's Piece\nLetter:\nDear Sir, Imperial College Union,\nAt today's in quo rate Union Meeting the President, Mr.\nCorbyn in his capacity ex officio as Vice-president of all\nI.C. clubs called the assembly a meeting of I.C. Debating\nSociety and continued to discuss motions which he intends\nrecommending to Council in Debating Society's name. I maintain that this is both unethical and unconstitutional.\nA meeting of the Debating Society was called without the\nknowledge of either the President of Debates or of any one of\nthe nine committee members and also at a time when a committee meeting was in full session one floor above the Concert Hall. I quote from the Debating Society's Constitution:\na) An E.G. M. of the society shall be convened upon the\nreceipt of the secretary of a petition signed by at least\n15 members or by a majority vote of the committee.\nb) Motions to be considered must be handed in to the\nsecretary three clear college days before such a meet-ing.\nThe motions discussed are unimportant to this letter. It\nis not my object to either agree or disagree with them. I fully sym pathis e with Mr. Corbyn in the difficulties of\nqu or ary in dealing with a largely uninterested Union. But\nthis is not to vindicate his actions. It is clearly unethical to\nusurp the idea of quorum and to by-pass the Union members in this way.\nTaken to its extreme it is clearly undesirable for a committee member to hold a spontaneous meeting, decide on a motion and then in the name of his society recommend it to\nCouncil. In the event of this happening the motion holds as\nmuch weight as the degree of authenticity in which it was\nachieved.\nToday's events are alien to the aims of the Debating\nSociety. It is a misuse of a society whose objectives are\nsolely to propagate the art of debate, I quote from the Constitution.\n\" To provide facilities for public speaking and the holding\nof debates for the interchange of ideas.\"\nand not for Union policy making.\nThe Debating Society dissociates itself from all motions\nemerging from today's gathering of some members of the\nSociety, It also calls upon Council to censure this violation\nof constitution and reject any motion that they should be\npresented with in this way.\nJohn R. Reynolds. President.\nCorbyn Replies\nDear Editor,\nHaving seen the letter from the President of Debates, I have a few points to make.\n1. I did not at any stage call an EGM a meeting of the\ndebating society. This was done by Keith Guy, Secretary of\nthe Union.\n2. As far as I am concerned, the meeting was a meeting of\n260 IC students, as was suggested by me at the time, and\nwhich I stated at the outset, when asked to chair it. I will\nrefer its two decision to Council in this form. I think that\nthis is the best, if not the only way, to deal with the problem\nof 40 missing students, who were not there because of the\nunfortunately short time to publicise the meeting.\n3,1 think it would be stupid and undemocratic of Council\nto disregard a meeting of IC students of this size,\nPiers Corbyn,\n(Vice President of Debates ex-officio).\nUL\u2014Senate House\nYou all heard about the\nbeating on Tuesday 21st at\nSenate House, of a UC student involved in a demonstration about the links between UL and Rhodesia.\nFollowing UC'sEG M on\nThursday 23rd, a meeting of\n13 Presidents of Colleges was\ncalled on Sunday 26th, eye\nwitnesses present at the meeting felt that UL was attempting to whitewash the whole\naffair in sending numerous\nstatements to Rectors and\nPresidents \u2014 they are still\nsending them! The demo on\nMonday 27th led to a call by\nSOAS (Scnool ot Oriental\nand African Studies) for\nmore EGM's. Our EG M on\nthe 30tn was held at rather\nshort notice, but, despite the\nm quo racy later in the meet-ing, Council will probably\nsend \u00a35 to each of SOAS and\nUC, and the UL will still\ntake notice of our support\nfor the ULU Students' Representative Council motion.\nThe motions about links between IC and Southern\nAfrica and LEA's hall fees\nincrease will be referred to\nnext Thursday's UGM.\nDiversification\u2014\nWhat Next\nThe EG M on the 30th enabled a very useful and important discussion, following the BoSt meeting on\nWednesday 29th, to take\nplace (see elsewhere in\nFELIX) the results being\nconveyed to the Pro-Rector\nthe next day. If the student\nbody is to get what it wants\nin diversification, we will\nhave to clearly and forcibly\nstate our case on each development of it, and we must\nensure all the time that your\nrepresentatives have your\nsupport and you know what\nthey are doing\u2014which means\nconvey your ideas and comments to your Academic\nOfficers, Dept, Reps., and me\netc! A strong Union means\nnegotiating strength!\nOur statement on the\nArchitectural Association\n(where we said that we want\nour say in all the merger\nnegotiations and that their\nlevel of participation should\nnot be dropped merely to\nmatch ours) and our unanimous motion for representation of 5 on the BoSt. and\nbetter representation on the\nGOB and F and E will be\nconsidered by a special meeting of the BoSt. on November 12th. Their decisions can\nbe discussed at the U GM on November 13th. Strong Union\nIf, as some people suggested at the EG M, the\nUnion decides to make when\nthe Queen comes some public statement or action about\nour policies and how well\nthey have been met, it would\nbe useless unless it had wide\nsupport, which means \u2014\nmake sure you know about\nand agree (I hope!) with\nUnion policy. Your Dept.\nreps, have just been elected\n\u2014make sure that they do\ntheir jobs! If you have any\ncriticisms of the Union or\nanybody in it make them to\nthe Union (letters to Council\nor Union or tell any official\netc.) only then can they be\nput right.

Publications Board, Imperial College, London, S.W.7 COLCUTT\nThis last week has seen the Union Office overloaded with\nwork. Piers Corbyn is blamed for not doing all the mundane\nwork despite the fact that he works twice as hard as anyone\nelse. This is unjust because surely it is not the President's job\nto handle the day to day matters anyway.\nRecently the Union got lumbered with the job of trying to\nget 100 students to have tea with the Queen when she visits\nthe College, and a further 120 to act as Stewards. The\namount of organisation for this is quite considerable especially considering that the majority of students would prefer\nthe afternoon off anyway.\nSurely then, if the Rector needs to have students to decorate the visit, he could get his own paid clerical staff to\norganise this. In general the Admin has far better lines of\ncommunication with the majority of students than has\nthe Union.\nAs a note on this we should be wary that students participation should be participation in decisions and not participation in the mundane work of the Admin. Several Union reps\non College committees are asked to do minor publicity and\nother jobs, despite the fact that they have their own academic\nwork, and usually a fair amount of Union work as well. The\nUnion is there to look after the welfare of students, it is not\na branch of the College Administration.\nI notice the Union Bar clique have returned to their habit\nof challenging the quorum at Union meetings to prevent\npopular motions being passed. This time, John Darley\nsucceeded in stopping a motion supporting the RCA students\nwho wish to use our Swimming Pool without paying an extortionate charge of \u00a31 per term. Obviously the Rugby Club\nwould rather see the pool nearly empty (as it often is) than\nput to good use by USK. How long will it be before RCA\nstops the many IC people Who use \"their refectory as a welcome escape from the torture of a Mooney meatball? Even\nthe Rugby Club must eat somewhere.\nAlthough the Mooney empire has increased with the opening of College Block the efficiency and standard have hardly\nimproved. If RCA can provide reasonable food at reason-able, prices why can't Mooney? The impotent Refectories\nCommittee cannot do anything worthwhile, so what about a boycott of Mooney Southside? Perhaps that would encourage him to provide a better service.\nUNIVERSITIES\nFOR THE 1970's This important weekly series of feature\narticles discusses the vital issues:\nEducation for What ?

The\nactual reason for the disturbance is still not absolutely\nclear. A man of, it is said,\nPolish origin came out of\none of the Mews' houses,\nobviously discontented, and\nproceeded to remonstrate\nwith another man about to\ngo in. At this point someone\nfrom inside the house came\nout, armed with a walking\nstick, and a fight ensued \u2014\nthe outcome being that the\nPole was left outside shout-ing. By this time virtually\nall the residents (and others)\nof Southside were watching\nthe scene, much to the\ndelight of someone in an\nadjoining house, who was\nhammering away on a piano\nin an effort to entertain the\ncrowds.\nThe police made several\nCarnival Winks The first carnival collection stunt took place this weekend\nwhen Guilds and Mines went winking down Oxford Street\non Saturday morning,\nThe prospect of collecting a large amount of money was\nhampered on Friday by a threat from the Metropolitan\nPolice to arrest anyone with a collecting can, however over\n80 people turned up on Saturday. Considerable confusion\nwas created by Mines and Guilds taking opposite sides of the\nroad and racing the length of Oxford Street. Mines reached\nOxford Circus first and headed for Piccadilly Circus while\nGuilds returned to Marble Arch via C and A's. On reaching Piccadilly a large crowd was drawn by the\nspectacle of a group of students winking down the steps into\nPiccadilly Underground and winking out even faster hotly\npursued by the Law.\nThe return journey by tube was further enlightened by\nDennis Taylor and his maga phone announcing the 1969\nWorld Underground Winking Championships as a number\nof Guildsmen winked the length of a train.\nThe day finished with final score of\nMetropolitan Police Carnival\n\u00a3100\n0\nDon't miss the 3-legged pub-crawl down the Kings Road\non November 14th with the women of Maria Assumption\nand the Institut Francais.\nDANE HOBMAN\nMoon at I.G. visits and on one of these\nremoved the Pole, who was\nstill seething with discontent,\nbut latterly had been conducting an impromptu Southside choir in a truly\npatriotic rendering of Land\nof Hope and Glory, accompanied by the fellow at the\npiano, to the obvious annoyance of some of the other\nlocal residents.

The\nprize shared with Professor\nOdd Hassel of Oslo University was given for their work\n\"in developing and applying\nthe concept of conformation\nin chemistry.\"\nResearch in this branch of\nchemistry was first undertaken by Prof. Hassel in the\n1940's and was continued by\nProf. Barton's work in 1950\non dynamic stereochemistry\nwhilst a visiting Professor at\nHarvard, Prof. Barton's work has led to developments in the theory of molecular shapes and three-dimensional models of molecules and has led to a better\nunderstanding of how\nnatural substances such as\nsteroids, alkaloids and terpenes react, Prof. Barton\nhimself going on to study the\nprocesses in which plants\nand moulds synthesize the\nnatural substances. Prof.\nBarton, now aged 51,\nwas a student at Imperial\nCollege and returned here in\n1957 after holding posts at\nvarious other universities.\nWith typical IC can dour he\nsaid that he was not particularly surprised to hear of\nthe award \u2014 \"scientists\nusually know where they\nstand on the international\npecking order.\" Judging by\nthe euphoria and champagne to be found in the\nchemistry department last\nFriday, after the public\nannouncement of the award,\nhis lack of surprise did not\nimpede the celebration of his\nprize.\nProf. Barton now joins the\nhallowed ranks of other\neminent IC scientists who\nhave also gained a Nobel\nPrize, Professor Chain of\npio chemistry and Prof.\nBlackett, senior research\nfellow of the physics dept.\nand a scientific advisor to\nthe government.\nI.C.U.

There was no\nquorum \u2014 the meeting\nclosed. Before challenging\nthe quorum, John Darley\nmade it clear that he would\nnot challenge if the matter\nwas dropped. With all due\nrespect to John, this was not\nthe oft heard voice of reaction scared that its ideas\nwould be held up to open\nridicule but a genuine feeling\nthat he, and A.C.C. should\nhave been given notice of\nthe motion beforehand. After\nall this motion concerned\nJohn's committee as much as\nI,C.U. Low cunning entered in\nthe form of Keith Guy who\nby a laudably intricate move\nchanged the E.G. M. to a meeting of the Debating\nSociety! \u2014 with Piers as\nchairman. But as Piers\nwanted to propose the U.C. motion, Keith Guy took i he chair.\nAfter sufficient heckling\nfrom our still vocal right\nand similar, if more constructive intransigence from\nour increasingly vocal left,\nthe motions on the floor were\nall passed with large major i ties, much to the amazement\nof all after the haranguing\nthat had gone on. Of course,\nthe motions passed were\nquite unman da table and\npresumably the second take\nof the whole scene will take\nplace at the next Union\nmeeting.\n\n"

Union is\nconcerned, the Morphy Day\ntowpath battle does not\nexist any more, as a motion\nwas passed at an R.C.S. Union meeting last year saying that:\n'Whilst continuing to\nsupport the Morphy Cup\nraces, R. C.S.U. dissociates\nitself completely from the\ntowpath battle'.\nIn my personal opinion, in\npassing that motion, by a very large majority, R.C.S. Union members showed a great deal more common\nsense than C. and G. and\nR.S. M. put together have\never done in their whole\nhistory.\nFurther, I hope that R.C.S. is leaving thug ger y and in-ter constituent college rivalry\nfar behind, and is heading\ntowards a new era of res-pon sibi lit y. Yours sincerely,\nJohn I. Butterworth\nPresident R. C.S.U. Distrait\nSir,\nLast week I had the fortune to try the College Block\nsnack bar for the first time.\nI agree with Mr. Lambert\n(Felix \u2014 9 October) that if\nyou hold the tray back to\nfront and stop quickly then\ncups of tea, yoghurt etc., are\nlaunched in a similar manner\nto aircraft from an aircraft\ncarrier. Also if you hold the\ntray upside down (or even\ndownside up) everything falls\noff.\nHowever, if you hold the\ntry Itihe right way round its\npurpose 'is obvious, the tray\nis designed to fit on a table.\nThis brain wave struck me as\nI approached the cash desk,\nso having paid I sallied\nforth triumphant to look for\na place to sit and eat my\ndelicious Mooney chips.\nAfter dodging round, over\nand under customers returning empty trays I had to clear\nempty milk packs, yoghurt\ncartons (you can make lovely\nlampshades with the Ski\nones), knives, forks, plates,\nchips etc., to place my tray\nwith the gravy, milk and\nyoghurt quagmire on the\ntable. I then had the pleasure\nof eating my chips. Only two\nof us still had our trays.\nWhy IC students should\nbe so slow to adopt this new\ntechnique baffles me. The\nadvantages are obvious:\n1) Fewer customers rushing about after emptying\ntrays, hence less time is spent\nin the snack bar and more\ncustomers can be accommodated.2) Cleaner tables.\n3) Improved quicker,\neasier clearing of tables.\nI hope some of the snack\nbar customers will adopt the\ncorrect and polite methods of\neating in College Block.\nRoss Maxwell.\nDisillusion\nDear sir,\nIC, I am embittered and\ndisappointed with you. I now advise anyone not to\ncome here. I have made my\nmistake. A University is, I believe, a place where a person's horizons and outlooks are widened and en-rich ed. IC, you narrow and\nstifle your horizons. Being\nsuch a large college,\nspecialising so narrowly and\nbeing in London, you create\nan oppressive atmosphere.\nThere is no 'esprit de corps'\nand a lack of (if you'll excuse the word) loyalty. Instead you have established\nyourself as a large 'teaching\nmachine' sucking up sixth-former s and regurgitating\ngraduates. Your life largely\nconsists of work, beer and\nsport \u2014 Whoopee! \u2014 lectures 6 hours a day, study\n2 hours a day and that's your\nlot.\nThe Union, that most important instrument of\nstudent representation,\nappears to be in an insipid\nstate of stagnation \u2014 bogged\ndown in its own anarchy.\n101 committees organise\nnothing but 101 tons of\nwaste paper. In a college\nwith an appalling shortage of\nlodgings, totally inadequate\nrefectory facilities and a parking system rivalled only\nby Westminster City Council,\nyou merely preach a quasi-revolutionary feeling which\ndoes not satisfy the left wing\n\u2014 alienates the right wing\nand bores the moderates.\nFor heavens sake, IC, pull\nyourself out of it. I want a college to be proud of, an\nadvanced, mature college\nnot a feeble weak minded\none. You are standing on a rickety pedestal, and I, for\none, am going to try and\npush you off.\nMark M. Wood,\n1st year Mining.\nHaldane Again\nDear Sir,\nMr. David, in your last\n^edition, omits mention of\nsome facts concerning the\nHaldane Library, which we\nfeel may be of value to your\nreaders to know.\nBefore the Haldane\nLibrary came into existence,\nthe Union ran a fiction\nlibrary, staffed by students.\nThe Haldane then became\nresponsible for the administration of these books, with\nthe students still providing\nsome help in staffing.\nThe student committee\nexists primarily to look after\nthe Union funds (364 titles\nwere bought last year with\nUnion money), for which\npurpose a student librarian\nis elected to coordinate the\nfiction buying. The nonfiction is the responsibility of\nthe Haldane Librarian, who\nis always ready to listen to\nrecommendations for books.\nLast year, however, 36,000\ntitles were published in\nBritain alone, of which the\nHaldane was able to buy\n850 \u2014 in consequence anyone recommending a book\nmust be able to justify the\npurchase.\nYours faithfully,\nDouglas Irish, Chairman,\nstudent committee.\nGeoffrey Price, Secretary,\nstudent committee.\nHugh Spikes, Librarian,\nstudent committee.\nB.G. A. Dear Sir,\nIf you went to the Union\nmeeting you may have\nnoticed aB. Hains mutter\nsomething about a Business\nGraduates Association semi-nar. In case you missed this\nI have collected one of all\nthe pamphlets and these\nare available from my room\n(Linstead 434). Alternatively,\nyou may write direct to the\nB.G. A. at 87, Jermyn St.,\nLondon S.W.I. The aim of\nthe B.G. A. is \"to help to\npromote a wider and\naccelerated understanding,\nacceptance and use of\ngraduate business in education in British industry and\ncommerce\". If you want\nsome FREE advice on PG\ncourse, grants and career\nopportunities in business\nadministration, then I suggest that you contact these\npeople as soon as possible.\nYours sincerely,\nBrian Hains\nLetters to the Editor are\nalways welcome. They\nshould be of about 300\nwords in length, and must\nreach FELIX by no later\nthan the Thursday lunchtime\npreceding publication. The\nEditor reserves the right to\nomit any letter, or to condense it for space reasons.\nWith the present concern\nfor the broader education\nof scientists and engineers,\nit is instructive to consider\nthe opposite approach. This\nwould narrow the training\nto specific often strictly\nvocational courses. The\npresent allegations that\nScientists are used simply\nas problem solvers directed\nby the whims of management would then become\nthe literal truth, although\nmanagement would also be\nsimilarly trained. The effectiveness and structure of\nsuch a system would be\njudged on several grounds.\nFirstly, as far as big\nIndustry is concerned, it\nmust be as good as the\npresent system at \u2022 solving\nspecific problems. Assuming\nthat the competence of the\nspecialising majority will be\nat least as high as the present\nmore generally trained wor-kers, the difficulty will\narise with those responsible\nfor those who are to distribute the work. These\npeople must have .a wider,\nand certainly less detailed\neducation. This indicates a hierarchical educational\nsystem, expanding and up-grading Polytechnics\nC.A.T.S., industry - financed\ncourses, and business\nschools, at the expense of\nthe Universities, which then\nbecome responsible for providing the more generally\ntrained 'overseers' and for\nresearch, too complex to\nundertake elsewhere (hence\nthe P.G. population will\nrise). Higher management,\nresponsible for policy\ndecisions with reference to\nthe forecasts of attain ability made by our 'general scientists'; will require a very\ngeneral education; which\nin practise will mean an\nArts degree.\nObservant readers will\nnotice that these postulated\nchanges are not unlike\npresent Governmental policy\non higher education. It is\nreasonable to suppose that\ngiven the choice of a fully\ntrained specialist and a generally educated person\nrequiring further training,\nindustry will chose the for-mer: the postulated changes\nin education and the further degeneration of scientific work then form a vicious circle, as without a very far reaching change of\nGovernment policy the\npreference of industry will\nonce again, as in the past,\ndictate the form of higher\nscientific education.\nThat is why it is important to arrest the progression\nat once by pressing for\nbroader scientific education\nat all higher levels, not just\nUniversity. The alternative\nis to specialise ad infinitum,\nwhich most people will tire\nof sooner or later.\nYours etc.,\nP. Lee Physics 3.\n\"The trouble with Lloyds is that there's nothing to protest about.\"\nLloydsBank say*yes'\nto student freedom.\nBecause Lloyds Bank don't make charges to students. Our services are absolutely free\u2014as long as\nyour account is kept in credit.\nMaybe you don't consider it\nworth opening a bank account while\nyou're on a student grant. It is worth\nit. A bank account is by far the best\nway of planning, controlling and\nkeeping track of your spending however limited your means.\nThe key is your Lloyds Bank\nmanager.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX 6th November, 1969\n\"Day 4: Subjects\nappear quite normal!\nThat is, large amounts\nof food have been consumed and requests\nfor more are being\nmade with alarming\nfrequency\".\nOne might wonder why\nthe eating habits of two\npeople should concern a twenty strong expedition\nteam and six medical attendants or require three years\nplanning, or seventeen aqua-lungs dumped on a barren,\nrocky peninsular!\nHowever, perhaps this\nwill become clear when we\nsay that these two men were\nactually living 20 feet below\nthe Mediterranean off Marfa\nPoint, North West Malta.\nTheir world was a small inflatable house, moored in 35\nfeet of water, looking very\nmuch like a cottage loaf. Its\nstrength lay in a tough nylon\n/neoprene skin attached to a steel frame. It could be well\ndescribed as an 'underwater\ntent'.\nThe house was moored\n130 feet from the shor\u00a7, but\nit could have been 130 miles,\nfor it was completely isolated\nwith no airlines or power\ncables.\nThe heart of the system\nwas a box, about the size\nof the average television set.\nThis contained the life support system which kept the\ntwo subjects alive and\nhealthy. Inside were a pair\nof emergency batteries which\npowered a blower unit; the\ninterior lights; and an air\npurification unit containing\nsoda lime to remove C02 THE MALTESE\nEXPEDITION\nWords: Claire Denis Barnes and Peter Newman\nfrom the atmosphere and\nactivated charcoal to absorb\ntrace impurities.\nOxygen was 'bled' into the\nhouse from a cylinder resting\non the sea bed. The main\npower unit which was also\noutside the house, was a fuel\nbattery which generated\nelectricity directly from H2+02 gases. It could run unattended for three weeks. The\nlife-support module was exhausted after twenty four\nhours and was replaced\ndaily.\nThe expedition was run\njointly between Imperial\nCollege, London University\nand Enfield College of Technology. The teams arrived in\nMalta towards the end of\nJuly bringing the first of the\nstructures strapped to the\nroof of the Enfield College\nLandrover. Soon the base\ncamp was established on\nMarfa Point and by early\nAugust the first underwater\nhouse S. D.M. Mark I, was\nmoored at 30 feet in 70 feet\nof water, the life support\nunits had been assembled\nand tested.\nThe Mark I house had\ntaken four months to design\nand build. Many problems\nhad arisen: for example, the\nconstruction of a frame\nsufficiently rigid to take the\nloads involved (the displacement of the house was\nestimated at 8 tons), yet light\nenough to be carried by four\npersons. Another complexity\nwas the prediction of the\nbehaviour of the skin when\nsubjected to tensions as high\nas 100 pounds per inch. It\nwas this last problem that\nproved the most difficult to\nsolve; quite a number of mistakes were made initially,\nbut we had learnt by our\nexperience; a new skin had\nto be built before we left\nEngland and arrangements\nwere made to construct a new type of frame in Malta,\nthe combination of these\nbecoming the S. D.M. Mark\nII house.\nBy August 17th, we were\nnearly fully prepared to\nbegin the underwater living\nexperiment. The Mark I house had been submerged\nfor a week and it appeared\nto be as solid as a rock; personnel had been inside it\nfor periods of two or three\nhours at a time, assembling\nthe complex internal frame\nsupporting bunks, table and\nhoist, and during this time\nthe life-support modules had\nworked perfectly. The telephone link to the house had\nbeen established and conversation between habitat and\nshore was extremely clear.\nOn shore, members of the\nsupport team had been\nallocated their tasks in the\nevent of any mishap, and a rota had been drawn up for\nthe continuous watch which\nwould be kept once the experiment began.\nWires for lighting, telephones and search-lamps\nsnaked over the rocks; the\nsubjects were going yet\nagain through the procedure\nfor using C02&02 meters.\nA gentle westerly breeze\nhad been blowing all day and\na long low swell had\ndeveloped. Late in the after-noon, the wind strengthened\nand the sea had become\nrougher with frightening\nspeed. White h ores es came\nracing into the bay and\nbreakers dashed against the\nlow reefs. Two of the most\nexperienced divers kit ted up\nand were in the water as\nquickly as possible to find\nWorking outside the Undersea \" House \"\nthat the structure on its long\nmooring ropes was swaying\nabout and jerking angrily.\nNo attempt was made to\nenter the house, all we could\ndo was to wait hopefully\nfor the sea to subside.\nThat night, freakish, gale-force winds swept across the\nisland and the morning found\n15 feet waves rolling into the\nbay, the shore installations\ndamaged, tents down, large\nareas underwater and the\ndiving ladder demolished.\nBy the following day the\nseas had calmed down\nenough for a brief recce dive.\nOur worst fears were con-firmed, three of \u2022 the six\nmooring ropes had snapped,\nthe house lay on its side,\npartly deflated and with the\nfabric pierced by the internal\nhoops. The house, its moor-ing, and the life-support unit\nwere completely wrecked.\nHowever, progress had\nbeen made on the S. D.M. Mark II house during the\npast month. A frame had\nbeen quickly built of a simpler design, relying on a more sophisticated mooring\nsystem to spread the load-ing. The tricky task of\nattaching the skin to the\nframe had fortunately been\ncompleted the previous week.\nWithin only one week of\nthe disaster, it was 'all systems go' \u2014 The Mark II\nhouse was moored at 20\nfeet and the fuel cell was on\nthe sea bed ten feet below;\na life-support unit had been\ninstalled and internal fittings\nhad been built up on the\nspot, using 'Dexion'.\nHowever the Mediterranean had not finished with\nus yet! Once more a long\nswell built up, the prelude to\nan even more violent storm.\nHowever, the few brief\nhours' warning were sufficient to weight down the fuel\ncell, remove the internal\nstructure and deflate the\nMark II to tie it down onto\nthe sea bed. We watched the\nstorm increase in ferocity \u2014\nthen without warning it subsided suddenly and the air\nwas perfectly still and the\nsea like a mill pond.\nDue to these delays, we\nwere now working against\nthe clock to get the divers\ninto saturation. The expedition personnel were working\nfourteen and fifteen hours a day, and late in the evening\nof August 31st the first diver\nwent down to the house.\nThere are as yet no text\nbooks written on how to run\nan underwater house, nor\neven Any tables stating when\na diver becomes saturated.\nAll we can say is, that, sometime during the next couple\nof days we crossed this\nline.\nThe economics of saturation diving have been spelt\nout many times, the decompression time for a saturated\ndiver is a constant, independent of the working time, so\nthe ratio of working time to\ndecompression time can be\nmade large.\nWe were not working at\ndepths where this economic\nargument could be applied,\nbut this does not detract\nfrom the validity of the ex-peri ment. From 1st \u2014 4th September\nthere were two divers living\nin the house.\nno complaints of sleepless-ness.\nIn this thoroughly satisfactory environment, work\nbegan. The first priority was\nto complete the interior\narrangements and thoroughly\ncheck over all the equip-ment. A 'wireless' telephone\nlink, the first of its type to be\nused, was established to the\nshore. When these initial\ntasks were satisfactorily com-ple ted, the divers started the\nwork in hand.\nThe main project was a research experiment on diver\ni rearing; the sea is not the\n'silent world' of popular\nmyth, a diver can hear\nDiver's return to the House\nLife inside the house was\nsimilar to that of a small\ncaravan. On entering, the\ndiver left his aqualung tied\nto the mooring ropes, and\nclimbed in. A freshwater\nshower, a towel-down and\nsome dry clothes, usually\nshorts and shirts, would enable the diver to remain in\na dry and pleasant cond i tion.\nFood, and even wine, were\nbrought down regularly and\nthe occupants brewed up\ntheir own coffee and\nchocolate, and often invited\nvisiting divers to a' cup pa'. Because air was not being\npumped into the house, the\nsource of considerable\nirritation in previous experiments, that of the sound of\nair bubbling out, was\navoided. All was quiet except the purring of the air\ncirculation, the occasional\nsplash of a fish jumping into\nthe house and the ubiquitous\n'snapping shrimps'. The\naquanauts' sleep was disturbed once each night at\nabout 4 a.m. for readings\nof COz & 0 2 concentration.\nApart from this, there were\nthe sound of his companions\nbreathing above the general\ncrackle of the aforementioned noisy shrimps!\nTests were carried out 'in\nthe wet' by divers from the\nhouse and delicate instruments were used 'in the dry'.\nMany of the^se operations\nwere recorded on film, some\nof which was shown on\ntelevision in Britain; also a telephone call was made\nfrom the house to Imperial\nCollege announcing our success. The house was in operation\nfor nearly a week and five\ndivers spent over 200 hours\nunderwater, living in the\nhabitat. The longest continuous period spent by one\ndiver was four days. This\nwas considerably less than\nwe had hoped. As a result\nthe organisers are considering the possibility of operating the house in United\nKingdom waters. The team\nis still largely complete and\nmuch of the equipment is\nreadily at hand. All that is\nrequired is the means to\nbring the house back from\nMalta and continue the\nexperiment in Britain.\n\n"

    "content": "6th November, 1969 FELIX Page 7\nWAR OF THE SEXES\nWomen are what men wake up to find themselves married\nto. They too have 2 hands and 2 feet, but also 2 hairpieces,\n2 sets of false eyelashes and a whole paraphernalia of other\nodds and ends. Not content in being exactly what the others\nare, they also insist on doing exactly what the others do.\nThough a woman finds it hard to keep a secret, for women\nhave a keen sense of rumour, one secret she can keep is\nher age. Between 30 and 40 is the longest year of her life.\nBut the years that a woman subtracts from her age are not\nlost. They are added to the ages of other women.\nA woman is quite content with very little, if that little\nis precisely what she wants, if not, then nothing is enough.\nThe only way to get on with her is to let her imagine that\nshe is having her own way. The only way to do this is to\nlet her have her own way. Every woman is wrong till she\ncries, then she is right \u2014 instantly. A woman never admits\nshe has lost an argument. She just thinks she has failed to\nmake her position clear. She has a great sense of right and\nwrong, but little sense of right and left.\nA woman takes 20 years to make a man of her son, and\nthan another woman takes 20 minutes to make a fool of him.\nHaving made a sheep of him, she always tells him he is a lion with a will of iron. She works 10 years to change a man's habits, and then complains that he is not the man\nshe married.\nIt is true that woman gives to man the very gold of her\nlife, but she invariably wants it back in small change. It\nis hard to teach her that even a bargain costs money.\nIt is often woman who inspires man with the great things\nshe will prevent him from doing. She is vogue on the outside\nand vague on the inside. She is very much akin to a shadow:\nfollow her she flies, fly from her she follows. Love is the\ndelusion that one woman differs from another, and marriage\nis the dissolution of any such idea. On one issue, at least,\nmen and women agree: they both distrust women.\nWomen are not much, but they are the only alternative\nsex. So here's to woman. Would that we could fall into her\narms without falling into her hands.\nDAVID DANGOOR\nFRUSTRATION, BRUTALITY,\nAND A DIRTY LAUGH\nUniversity audiences for\nfilms are now so important\nthat 20th Century Fox have\ntaken on 23 year old\nSociology graduate Tony\nOrfredi as liaison officer to\nBritish University Film\nSocieties. This week he\norganised on behalf of Fox\nan advance screening of\n'The Magus' for film editors\nand Film Presidents of\nvarious student bodies. This\nis going to be a regular\nfeature and will give Felix\nan opportunity to publish\ntheir review in advance of\nthe dailies.\nThe Magus from John\nFowles' novel is set in the\nbeautiful Greek island of\nPhraxos and tells of the encounters of an English\nschoolmaster, Nicholas Urfe\n(Michael Caine) with Conchis (Anthony Quinn).\nwell seasoned foreigner\nand Lily (Candice Bergen).\nA frustrating book has been\nturned into a somewhat less\nfrustrating movie, which\nmoves rapidly from one\ninnuendo to the next by way\nof passionate encounters\nwith Anne (Anna Karina),\nan airline hostess, to some\ngory scenes with the nazis\nand culminating in the final\nanguish of Nicholas and\nLily.\nConchis a wealthy intellectual owns a villa on\nPhraxos, to which he invites\nmany guests including Lily\nand Nicholas. Gradually\nduring the course of the\nfilm the guests are introduced to Nick, who becomes\nmore and more confused at\neach turn in the road. Just\nas he thinks he's solved the\nmystery, the whole direction of the game is moved\nby Conchis, who continually\nsprings surprises on Nick.\nThe film ends as it begins\nwith a quote from T.S. Eliot:\n\"We shall not cease from\nexploration\nAnd the end of all our\nexploring\nWill be to arrive where\nwe started\nAnd know the place for\nthe first time\".\nThis really sums up the\nwhole enigma that is the\nMagus. \"Was lit real? someone asked after the show.\n\"What was it all about?\"\nwas another comment. Most\npeople when they leave this\nfilm will feel that they have\nbeen entertained, but at the\nsame time they may be a little non-plus sed and will\nalmost certainly feel\ncheated. How should the\nfilm end, even the producer\ndidn't know, so like the\nbook he plays with your\nemotions and then lets you\ndown. If one cares to\nanalyse it one could put a hundred and one interpretations on it, but the simplest\nthing, I think would be to\nsay that Conchis wants somebody to feel the terror that\nhe felt during the war when\nhe was told to execute three\nGreek Commandos by beating them to death. He\ncouldn't do it and so the\nGermans shot 80 hostages\nand he was left to fight his\nconscience for the rest of\nhis life. He desires passionately to share this pain with\nsomeone and chooses\nNicholas as a suitable victim.\nNicholas must face the test.\nWill he punish Lily for her\nanimal is tic unfaithfulness,\nor will he throw away the\ncat o' nine tails like Conchis did the gun.\nThe screenplay is almost\ncompletely different from\nthe book and of course weak\nby comparison, which is\nstrange since John Fowles\nwrote it. Anthony Quinn\nmakes a star performance\nas a typical Greek, which\nmakes up in my opinion for\nthe miscasting of Michael\nOaine, whose cockney accent\ntends to stretch the nerves.\nThis is an intriguing film\nwell worth a visit.\nA film that should really\nhave been left on the stage\nis The Royal Hunt of The\nSun. There is splendour and\nsavagery in Peter Shaffer's epic drama in w'h ii dh General\nPizzaro (Robert Shaw)\nleads an expedition to find\nthe South American kingdom of gold. The brutality\nof his Spanish army is\nstomach turning as they\nstrike down a thousand unarmed Incas. The drama\noccurs in the relationship\nbetween the captured Inca\nGod King Atahuallpa (Chris-top her Plummer) and Pizzaro. The situation grows intense as Pizzaro having\npromised Atahuallpa's freedom in exchange for a room\nfull of gold, has to search\nhis conscience when he finds\nout that if Atahuallpa goes\nfree all his men will die.\nThere is high drama here\nand some good acting from\nChristopher Plummer, but I wonder if this is really film\nmaterial.\nThe Virgin Soldiers takes\na sharp look at boys at\nwar. Playing around with\nprostitutes may be fun \u2014\nwatching your friends being\nkilled isn't. If you feel like\na dirty laugh don't miss\nthis one.\nCHRIS LEWIS\nMen are what women marry. They have 2 hands, 2 feet\nand sometimes 2 women but never more than one dollar\nand one idea at a time. Like Turkish cigarettes they are all\nmade of the same materials, the only difference being that\nsome are better distinguished than others.\nGenerally speaking, they can be divided into 3 classes:\nhusbands, bachelors and widowers. A bachelor is an\neligible mass of obstinacy entirely surrounded by suspicion.\nHusbands are of 3 types: prizes, surprize s and consolation\nprizes. Making a husband out of a man is the highest plastic\nart known to civilization. It requires science, sculpture,\ncommon sense, faith, hope and charity \u2014 mostly charity.\nIt is a psychological marvel that a small, tender, soft, violet\nscented thing like a woman should enjoy kissing a big,\nawkward, stubby chinned, tobacco and rum scented thing\nlike a man.\nIf you flatter him you frighten him to death; if you don't you bore him to death. If you permit him to make love to\nyou, he gets tired of you in the end; if you don't he gets\ntired of you in the beginning. If you agree with him in\neverything he says, you cease to interest him. If you argue\nwith him, you cease to charm him. If you believe all he\nsays, he thinks you are a fool, if you don't, he thinks you\na cynic.\nIf you wear gay colours and a mini-skirt, he hesitates\nto take you out. If you wear a little brown beret and a tailored suit, he takes you out and stares all evening at\nwomen in gay colours and mini-skirts.\nIf you join him in his ga ie ties and approve of his drinking,\nhe swears you are driving him to the devil. If you don't approve of his revelling and urge him to give up his ga ie ties, lie vows you are ice and snow.\nIf you are a clinging type, he doubts whether you have a brain. If you are a modern, advanced (and intelligent!)\nwoman, he doubts whether you have a heart. If you are\nsilly, he longs for a bright mate; if you are brilliant, he\nlongs for a playmate.\nMan is just a worm in the dust. He comes along,\nwriggles for a while, and finally some bird gets him.\nLINDA KHALASTCHI\nRECORD\nREVIEWS\nBasket of Light\nThe Pentangle,\nTransatlantic, TRA 205..\nNine tracks, including five\ntraditional folksongs and\nfour more modern pieces.\nThe main feature is the intricate Jansch \u2014 Renbourne\nguitar work con stra sting with\nJacqui McShee's incredible\nvoice. Bert Jansch sings on\nseveral tracks, and it takes\nsome getting used to, sounding reminiscent of some of\nthe vocal work on the\nIncredibles' LPs, but in\nmany ways it adds substance\nto the songs which would\notherwise sound ordinary.\nTwo very similar songs are\n\"Once I had a Sweetheart\"\nand \"The Cuckoo\" but the\nbest is probably \"Hunting\nSong\" which features all the\nmusical talents of the group.\nAll instruments played are\nacoustic but there are one\nor two examples of multiple\nrecording. In short, it's good\nvalue as a stock of LP of\nsweet folk music, but no\ngreat step forward.\nKing Crimson's new LP on\nIsland is a good example\nof how music can be both\nprogressive and pleasant to\nlisten to. Although there are\nonly five tracks, any one is\ncompletely different in style\nfrom the rest, but some drag\non far too long and none\nhave anything resembling a good finish. Nevertheless,\nit's one of the most original\nrecords produced recently,\nand shouldn't be pushed to\none side as being \"by one of\nthose new groups\".\nLed Zeppelin's second\nLP, out Friday, October\n24th and called Led Zeppelin II (sic), is a classic\nexample of a record that\nmust be played on stereo\ngear to get the full benefit\nof the recording. For those\nwho really like solid music\nwith strong vocals and\nguitar, this record is a must.\nThe fr rn t side opens with\n\"Whole Lotta Love\", a rocky number that has so\nmuch stereo panning that\nwhen I listened to it on headphones my brain nearly fell\nout of my head. The synchro-n is ed transitional balance is\nevident all the way through\nthe LP especially on my\nfavourite track \"Ramble\nOn'.\nFor those of you who\nhaven't heard of the group\nyou should try to hear them.\nIt is the type of music that\nreally grips you or bores you\nto death. It grips me alright!!\nLUNCHTIME O 'DISQUE\n\n"
