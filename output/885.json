    "content": "Athena discusses the pros and cons of religion.\nWhy For Art Thou? Is there a God? and which religion is\nbest? are questions that, in my opinion\ncannot be answered. But the effect that\nreligion has had, and the uses to which it\nhas been put can be shown through the\ncourse of history.\nIn the events of the Christian Old Testament, people were united to escape\nthe slavery of the Egyptians. It gave\npeople hope, something to live for. Be\ngood in life and you will be rewarded in\nHeaven. In English history, under Richard\nI, it persuaded knights to leave their\nhomes and destroy whole nations of\n'Godless heathens', so providing a convenient way to rid the country of\nviolent men, bored after the wars in\nEurope, and dump them somewhere else\nwhere they would be much less trouble.\nLater, in Europe, there were many rival\nPopes, the Church being the ruling body.\nThe Popes were rival dictators, using\ntheir positions for greed and personal\ngain. Religion gave them the power to do\nas they wanted.\nFrom the very beginning of Christianity,\nup until only a few years ago, it has been\ntaught that women are to be subservient,\nalmost second class citizens. Now, in the\nrecent years of AIDS and promiscuity, the\nhead of the Catholic church tells us not to\nuse condoms. Kids fuck; its genetic. Why not accept the fact, and give them some\nprotection? 'But if they were good\ncatholics they wouldn't have sex.' you\nsay, but in the sixteenth (I think) century,\nthere was a tax imposed on priests for\ntheir illegitimate children! In Britain\nChristianity is the official religion. This is\nnot racist, but it certainly discriminates\nagainst people who hold other beliefs, or\nnone at all.\nMohammed was born in 570AD and his\nteachings are recorded in the Koran.\nPracticing Muslim parents ensure that\ntheir male children learn Arabic at the\nMosque schools in order to read it.\nMohammed is the most important in a long line of prophets, which include\nAbraham, Moses and Jesus. In the\nmosques women pray separately from the\nmen. Again, like Christianity, women are\nsecond class citizens; only recently in an\narticle on Asian businessmen, the head of\na family business stated that only sons\nand sons-of-sons were invited into the\nbusiness. I know of many Asian women who do not have the same freedom as\ntheir brothers. Many are not bothered by\nthis, but there are many who are, and\nthey rely on their fathers for financial\nsupport through university. It has been\nsuggested to me that since, under British\nlaw, sexism is illegal, these women could\n'tape' their fathers 'threats' and sue them!\nBut we are talking about loving parents\nand their religious beliefs, and children\nwho dearly love them. The solution, of at\nleast one girl I know, is to play along\nuntil one has sufficient financial security\n(a degree) to refuse the parents. Another\nsimilarity with Christianity is the concept\nof a holy war and martyrdom. Just like\nRichard I, the Iranian theocracy has\ndemanded the death of Salman Rushdie\nfor crimes against Allah, and President\nHussein has called for a holy war against\nthe US.\nIn Hinduism, the body is like a 'suit' for\nan immortal soul, and what we do in one\nlife affects our status in our new life: i.e. if one is a devoted and obedient servant,\nthen in the next life, one might come\nback as a master. But not in ones own lifetime. Apart from this strict caste\nsystem (currently a subject of major\ncontroversy in India) Hinduism is the\nmost liberal of religions. It encompasses\nmany different beliefs and forms of\nworship, and it is the least tolerant of\nviolence, indeed many Hindus are\nvegetarian. However, in the caste system\nlawyers and soldiers are rated above\ntraders and industrialists.\nThere is not the space to discuss (nor\ntime to research) all religions, or\nvariations (eg Mormons), but as a cynic I would like to make some conclusions\nabout the purpose of religion, and the\nuses to which it has been put:\n1. Religion is/has been used by lesser\ndeveloped countries to enforce necessary\nsocial moralities, eg all involve a mandatory donation of income,\ntheoretically for the poor. It is the\nultimate government. He who speaks for\nGod has the ultimate power.\n2. They impose marriage; sex only\nwithin the family. This is vital in small\ncommunities to ensure that genetic\nbrothers and sisters do not marry. This is\nmore important than who will raise and\neducate the children, who are also aided\nby the family group.\n3. Women are totally dependent on\nman, and should obey him. Man is very\nprotective of the producer of his children,\nhis genetic future. In a primitive society\n(English pre-20 century) they cannot do\nthe hard work that men need to, so they\ncan stay at home, cook in^ and\nreproducing.\n4. Hope and strength to survive in the\nface of adversity. In places where there is\na low standard of living, the hope of life\nafter death will persuade people to suffer\nin life rather than turn to crime or\nchallenge the system: 'the meek shall\ninherit the earth.'\nReligion is simply a form of social\ngovernment, which relies on the belief in\na God or Gods. Because of the age of\nthese religions they impose the social\nnecessities of the family unit, and the\ndependency of women. In a modern\n'civilised' country, there exists the welfare\nstate to provide (theoretically) for the\npoor.There is 'common law' marriage.\nMost importantly the invention of\nmachines means that mans superior\nstrength is no longer important, and there\nare civil laws to protect men and women.\nWe are in an intellectually dominated\nsociety, and sadly for men, women are\non average more intelligent than men.\nChristianity is adopting a sexually equal\nstance. The same cannot be said for most\nother religions, since the leaders of these\nreligions are based in countries where\nsuch sexism could, perhaps, be justified;\nwhere the majority of the people believe\nthat their leader talks for God, and would\ndie or kill at his word. As long as the\nchildren believe what they are taught by\ntheir parents, the religion persists. In\nBritain, the children are making the\nchoice not to teach religion to their\nchildren, and have been doing so for so\nlong now that the population would not\nkill in God's name. The same is\nhappening to British Asian people.\nIn conclusion, Religions are inherently\nsexist, and can appear to be racist. In the\nperfect future, all people can choose what\nto believe, and the state will ensure the\nabsence of racism, sexism, poverty,\ncrime. In the future we may be able to\ndecide on the genetic make-up of our\nchildren, perhaps give them 'racial traits'.\nBut will we have the right to choose for\nthem? Similarly, do we have the right to\nteach them one religion? If you have such\nfaith in your religion, can you not teach\nyour children all religions knowing that\nthey will eventually choose yours?\nAthena.\n10\nMichael Newman on the right to be blasphemous.\nBlasphemy!\nMany people reject institutional religions\nbecause of their long history of\nintolerance and the resulting violence.\nThe intolerance is expressed in the\nconcepts of heresy and blasphemy, when religious groups have resorted to law and\npunishment to defend their ideologies\nagainst criticism.\nMost religions are blasphemies to other\nreligions and the resulting conflicts have\nresulted in imprisonment, torture and\nmillions of deaths. The Bible (Levitious\nXXIV,16) states 'He that blaspheme th the\nname of the Lord, he shall surely be put\nto death, and all the congregation shall\nsurely stone him'. Yet if you believe in a wise and just God the Bible itself can be\nconsidered a blasphemy!\nWhen Richard Carlisle was tried in\nOctober 1819 for the blasphemy of\nrepublishing Thomas Paine's 'The Age of\nReason' he read out to the court the\nwhole of Paine's book. He was not\nallowed to read out objectionable pieces\nof the Bible. Paine, as a Deist, found the\nBible truly offensive, as he states in 'The\nAge of Reason.'\n'Whenever we read the obscene stories,\nthe voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel\nand tortuous executions, the unrelenting\nvindictiveness, with which more than half\nthe Bible is filled, it would be more\nconsistent that we called it the word of a demon than the Word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that has served to\ncorrupt and brutal is e mankind; and for\nmy own part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel...'\nDue to the continued fight led by the\nfree-thought and Secularist movements,\npeople like Carlisle and Bradlaugh, the\nblasphemy laws in this country were\nmade ineffective. For over fifty years\nthey were no longer applied, though the\nthreat was always there. Then in July\n1977 Mary Whitehouse successfully\nbrought a blasphemy libel case against\n'Gay News' for a poem depicting\nhomosexual images of Christ's body. In\nSeptember last year the film 'Visions of\nEcstacy' was refused a certificate for\npublic showing in this country because it\nwas considered blasphemous. It portrayed\na nun's erotic dreams of her 'marriage' to\nChrist.\nThe problem with the modern debate is\nthat it revolves around free speech and\nexpression, whether people should have\nthe right to blaspheme. Yet the act of\ncommitting blasphemy is not simply one\nof insulting religion. It can be seen as a necessary part of defending our\nhumanity.\n'One of the main impetuses behind the\nbook was to make some kind of secular\nconfrontation with the idea of\nrevelation.'\u2014Salmon Rushdie on 'The\nSatanic Verses'.\nIf we are to defend the human nature of\nknowledge, the concept of truth relying\nupon evidence and reason, with the ever\npresent risk of error, we must attack\nrevelation. We must portray the words of\nall prophets, and men who deify\nthemselves, as words of human beings, to\nbe judged as such. To admit revelation is\nto corrupt truth, to lose the test of fact in\nwhat things are. As Dr Jacob Bronowski,\nscientist and Humanist, points out a consequence of this is losing the sense of\nfact in what a human being is. He walked\nthough Auschwitz concentration camp,\nwhere his family were killed, and made a plea for the human nature of knowledge:\n'When people believe they have absolute\nknowledge, with no test in reality, this is\nhow they behave. This is what men do\nwhen they aspire to the knowledge of\ngods.'\nA new campaign, based on Bronowski's words is starting at this College,\nencouraging people to support and\ncommit blasphemy. Religions are not just\na political excuse for violence, revelation\ngives them the conceptual foundations to\nbuild the gallows, torture chambers and\nthe gassing showers.\nShelley's blasphemous poem sums up\nwhat is really at stake:\nEarth groans beneath religion's iron age,\nAnd priests dare bab bel of a God of\npeace,\nEven whilst their hands are red with\nguiltless blood,\nMurdering the while, uprooting every\ngem of truth, exterminating, spoiling all,\nMaking the earth a slaughterhouse!\nLet's start knocking down the foundations\nof that slaughterhouse.\nInformation for this article comes from\n'Blasphemy\u2014Ancient and Modern' by\nNicholas Walter (\u00a33.95) and ' Why is it\nGood to be Blasphemous?' by Huxley\nSociety (free leaflet). Both of which can\nbe obtained from the TH Huxley Society\nSoc.\nReligious\nSurvey\nImperial College as a major science\ncollege in Britain has been chosen for a survey on attitudes of scientific people\ntowards Christianity. In many of today's copies of FELIX you will find a copy of\nthe questionnaire being used. You are\ninvited to fill it in as best you can and\npost it back in the boxes provided near\ndepartment porters desks. It does not\nmatter what your attitude is towards\nreligion\u2014agnostic, hostile or friendly\u2014for\nall opinions are required. There is ample\nroom on the questionnaire too for more\ndetailed comments if you wish to make\nthem, and these will all be welcomed.\nThe survey is being conducted by\nDavid Copestake, a psycho io gist near\nOxford whose son is a student at IC. He\nis a member of the Society for the\nScientific Study of Religion, the Institute\nfor Religion in an Age of Science (both\nAmerican) and the Sir Alister Hardy\nResearch Centre Oxford. In America\n(where perhaps many IC students will\nwant to work), there is a lot more\ninterest and understanding as regards\nscience and religion than in Britain. Many\ncolleges have specific courses en titel d 'science and religion' and textbooks are\npublished with these in mind.\nMr Copestake hopes to foster this kind\nof interest in this country and to write a book that could perhaps serve as a textbook on science and Christianity for\nstudents. Your help and cooperation will\nbe most appreciated. If you are very\nbusy, it need only take a few minutes,\nplease help us to get a balanced picture\nof peoples' views.\nThere will be boxes in most\ndepartments and in the JCR. If you\ncannot find a box, then please put the\nquestionnaire in the Z pigeonhole of your\ndepartment undergraduate pigeonholes,\nor sent it to Stephen Copestake,\nChemistry 2, via the pigeonholes.\n11\n\n"

    "content": "IiM QMW Departments Slashed\nQueen Mary and Westfield College is to\nlose at least one, and probably two\ndepartments. To alleviate an ongoing and\nunspecified deficit, their 'Cuts Group' have\nput forward four suggestions to save SI.5\nMillion. The cuts are much worse than\nexpected. All four options involve the\nclosure of Mediterranean Studies, the only\ndepartment of its type in Europe.\nThe options are:-A Make the cuts across all 15 loss-making departments.\nB Cut Biology and Engineering severely,\nand make smaller cuts across the other\ndepartments.\nCAs above, except Russian, Drama and\nGerman are excluded from cuts.\nD Close Biology completely, cut\nEngineering severely.\nQ MW College is opposed to A as it\nwould seriously damage many\ndepartments, and destroy Russian. B and\nC would probably lead to the closure\nof Biology anyway, and so option D seems most likely.\nThe options will be put to Universities\nFunding Council (UFC) on December 13.\nThe Q MW Student's Union Executive\nCommittee ( QM WSU Exec) believe that\noption D has already been decided upon\nby Professor George Zellick, acting\nPrincipal of Q MW, and the 'Cuts Group',\nand claim that UFC will act as a 'rubber\nstamp to that decision'.\nNo time scale has yet been announced\nfor the cuts, but it is rumored that cuts\nwould have to take place almost\nimmediately to be effective. All students\nwill be able to finish their degrees, but\nnot necessarily at Q MW. The closure of\nBiology will affect 700 students and 300\nstaff. Staff reductions across other\ndepartments are likely. There will be no\noverall drop in student numbers, as Q MW will increase the numbers on cheaper\nArts courses.\nQM WSU Exec believe that the crisis is\nthe result of 'years of under funding and\nmismanagement' and maintain that 'cuts\nof any kind are unacceptable'. They are\nencouraging students to write to their\nMPs over the cuts, and have started a petition. A march is being held on\nWednesday, starting at 2.00pm outside\nUL U and going on to UFC. Students from\nany college are encouraged to come\nalong and support the march.\nPaul Shanley, ICU president said that it\nwas 'sad that Q MW were putting financial\nconsiderations before academic ones', but\nthat the Mediterranean Studies closure\nwas 'no great loss, SOAS is the only one\nof its type in Europe, but it should be\nburnt down!'.\nPrint Unit Moves To Mary's The College Print Unit will be moving to\nSt.Mary's early next year, merging with\nthe facilities that exist there already. Mr Keith Fisher, Senior Assistant Secretary,\nServicing of Governing Body and\nCommittees, said that the increased cost\nof sending print work over to Mary's would be offset by labour savings as one\nprinter was leaving to do social work.\nMr Fisher admitted that no system for\ncollecting print work to be sent to Mary's had been produced yet, though this\nwould be dealt with. A lot of College\nprint work was sent to outside\ncontractors, Mr Fisher said. This is unlike\nMary's where a lot of printing is done\ninternally.\nClayponds\nLoretta O 'Callaghan, College\nAccommodation Officer, complained\nyesterday about students going to visit\nthe new Clayponds residential site. Still\nunder construction, she said that 'it's a building site, they shouldn't be there',\nadding that at the moment it was\ndangerous and that their actions were\n'ridiculous.'\nMiss O 'Callaghan said that she was very\npleased though with the number of\napplications resulting from the article in\nFELIX last week and the promotional\nhandouts for the site. The application\nforms were coming 'in droves' and that to\ndate they have received 'well over 200\napplication forms'. This she described as\nan 'excellent response.'\nWhen asked about replies and\nacceptances of applications she said that\nthese would be done as soon as possible,\n'hopefully before the end of the term.'\nHe said that the main advantage of the\nmove was to create a free room, the\nCollege being 'strapped for space',\nalthough there are no plans for the room\nat the moment. This, he said, was\nbecause a combination of circumstances\nhad lead to the move occurring in a short\nspace of time.\nMr Fisher said that the newer of the\ntwo off-set litho printers in College will be\nmoved to Mary's, replacing the 'ancient'\nunit there. He also said that the Print\nUnit's photocopier would be staying in\nSherfield and would be run by a junior\nmember of staff.\nOf the current Print Unit staff, Gary\nHumphries, (Photocopy and Finishing\nSupervisor) has handed in his notice\nwhilst Mr. Steve Davis, (Off-set Litho\nSupervisor) has been offered a placement\nat the Mary's site. Both of them said that\nthey were 'not very happy' with the\nplans.\nWhen asked if he had any involvement\nin the plan to move, Mr. Davis answered\n'none at all'. He said that he had received\na call a week a go from Mr Fisher who\noffered him a job at Mary's, starting on\nthe 1st of January.\nMr. Davis sees the main problem with\nthe move will be the customers. Many, he\nsaid, require print work straight away,\nand this will not be possible during the\nmove.\nMontpelier Confusion\nA 'positive decision' over the residents of\nMontpelier will be made on Friday said\nMr Gordan Marshall, Director of IC. He\nhad originally told Dr Richard Clarke,\nwarden of Montpelier, that the residents\nwould have to leave by the 16th December when their current contracts\nexpire.\nAfter reporting the original leaving date\nto residents, Dr Clarke, in a meeting on\nthe 11th November, told them that they\nwould be able to stay on until the end of\nMarch, a message he had received from\nAccommodation. Dr Clarke told Felix that\nhe had presumed that this meant until the\nend of the first term next year. He also\nsaid that he was receiving more\ninformation via Felix and the\nAccommodation office than from Mr Marshall.\nMr Clarke was told by Angus Fraser,\nManaging Director of Imperial College,\nthis Monday that he could not give any\nassurance that the residents could stay\nover Christmas and that a decision would\nbe made today, dependant on decisions\nby Westminster Council. Mr Marshall,\nhowever, said that it was proving difficult\nto get hold of Westminster and that\nvarious factors 'all seem to come out of\nthe woodwork together'.\nDr Clarke further said that it was\n'essential to plan over Christmas' for the\npossible lack of accommodation and that\nhe thought that students were 'not being\nconsidered' in the current plans.\n\n"

    "content": "ENVIRO\nChris Riley reports on a talk by Stephen Bristow of SOS Sahel.\nOur Common Future Within the developed world, factories,\ncars and homes pump out 'greenhouse'\ngases into the atmosphere. Many people\nnow believe that the global warming is\ncausing a contraction of the Tropical\nrainfall zone which reaches into central\nNorth Africa. Before the rains, the air is\nthick with fine sand, blown up by the hot\n'Harmattan' winds. Sand covers fields,\nclogs irrigation channels and ruins crops.\nWind blows soil from unprotected fields,\nand millions of tonnes of African earth is\nswept up into the atmosphere, to rain\ndown on the northern hemisphere.\nThe environmental problems we face\nare global, and need to be treated\naccordingly in our path towards a common future. However, in our shared\npresent, the people of sub-Saharan Africa\nremain the worst off and most in need.\nThe geographic region of Sahel lies in a broad strip across central Africa, between\n18 and 12 degrees north, spanning almost\nten countries from Senegal to Somalia.\nStrictly speaking, its borders are defined\nby annual rainfall figures of between\n150-600 mm per year. Thus in a given\nyear, such boundaries can advance or\nretreat up to 300 km north and south.\nRainfall in the Sahel, although\ncomparable with southeast England, is\nboth unreliable and erratic. Water, the\nkey natural resource of any arid zone, is\nprovided by hand-dug wells up to 100 m deep. Unfortunately, water resource\nmanagement is still in its infancy, and\nwater output from aquifers is not\nmatched by natural replenishment. As much as 90% of the rain is lost, cascading\noff the hard baked earth. In Mali, SOS\nSahel has responded to local requests to\nprotect soil from rain and wind erosion,\nplanting micro-catchment s and\nconstructing small, shallow pits to trap\nrain water.\nSahel is inhabited by some 50-60\nmillion people, 25% of whom live in\ntowns. Such demography is constantly\nchanging, with large scale migration from\nrural areas towards the bright lights and\nfalse promises of the towns.\nThe rural population, made up of\nsettled farmers and nomads, has survived\nsuccessfully for thousands of years with\ntheir self-balancing agricultural practice.\nIn the post-war years, politics,\neconomics and World Bank intervention\nhave combined to restrict farming activity\nto the point where government cash\ncrops have replaced community\nagricultural programmes. During the\ncolonial period, land was nationalised and\nthe state took up responsibility for trees.\nBefore this, the community as a whole\nhad to approve the felling of a tree.\nUnder state control, tree felling was not\npoliced properly, and large-scale\nuncontrolled deforestation took place.\nIn the whole of Africa, only one tree is\nplanted for every thirty cut down. Of\nthose planted, perhaps 5 in 100 survive.\nGrowth rates of woodland are 0.2-0.3 m per hectare per year, compared to 40-50\nm in the UK. With such slow growth, it is\nessential to forge a link between the\nplanting of trees and the long-term\nenvironmental and economic benefits.\nThe trees are vital, providing protection\nfor crops from scouring winds. Their\nroots bind the soil and help stop sand\nmovement, controlling the irreversible\nprocess of desertification. In the northern\nregion (an area the size of France), desert\nencroachment has destroyed entire\nvillages and is eating at productive,\nirrigated land. SOS Sahel is helping Nileside villages protect their lands by\nplanting shelter belts. To encourage locals\nto help with such forestry projects,\npersonal incentives are offered in the\nform of trees for their own farms.\n> Trees are a crop in themselves,\nproviding fuel, fodder, fruit and shade in\na region critically short of vegetation.\nThis programme of forestry also provides\nregular supplies of fuel and fodder for the\nfuture.\nWood to be used as fuel is meant to be\ncollected in the form of dead wood, not\nliving trees. People do not always adhere\nto such laws, and as a consequence the\nwoodlands do not survive. By careful\nforestry management, selected cutting\nand thinning can be balanced with forest\ngrowth to maintain and enhance annual\nwoodland enlargement. Ceramicallyinsulated fuel-efficient stoves are being\nintroduced to save wood.\nFor generations, the necessity to have\nas many children as physically possible\nhas been instilled in the people of the\nSahel. With low survival rates after birth\nin the past, it was essential to secure the\nfuture of the community. However,\nrecent improvements in health care,\nwater facilities and standards of living\nhave prolonged life. UNICEF\nim munis ation programmes have increased\nthe number of people surviving\nchildhood. However, family planning has\nnot evolved to take into account these\nhigher survival rates. Consequently, the\npopulations in the region are growing at\nfrightening rates: the population of\nEthiopia is currently 50 million, but is\nincreasing at 3% per year. Such growth\noffsets the improvements in agricultural\npractices.\nSo is the answer to enforce strict family\nplanning? Stephen Bristow thinks not.\n\"When local women are asked how they\nwill feed any further children, they reply\nthat the state will always feed them.\"\nThese attitudes clearly need changing. \"If\neducation is improved, the family\nplanning problem will solve itself.\"\nBristow believes that if living standards\nincrease, birth rates will naturally subside.\n\"But all this takes time\", he explains.\nTime is perhaps the only thing we have\nnot got, for until the population growth\nrate is controlled, and 'greenhouse' gas\nemissions are cut, there will always be\nfamine and starvation. Without these cuts,\nSOS Sahel's aid programmes will be\nmerely playing King Canute with the\ndesert and its people.\n\n"

    "content": "Mighty Force Dive 12\"\nThe influence of the dancefloor has\nfinally permeated to a stronghold of\nhardcore punk. It is, in fact, a very\nstrange record to come from Earache, a label renowned for its inability to sign\nany acts whose roots are not deep seated\nin the reign of hardcore thrash.\nDo Mighty Force come from\nManchester? If so their attempt to jump\non the bandwagon of 'Indie' related chart\nsuccess has failed. They have instead\ncreated a club monster. The A side is\nuninspired, boring, dance orientated,\ntoneless sludge.\nIt consists of a spineless back beat covered loosely by a splattering of\nsamples of dubious origin. (It went down\nwell at the Union disco.)\nThe B side\u2014 Thrashing a Dead House\u2014\n(Thrashdots/Adams edit) is, in fact, fairly\nsound. It shows the ability to break old\nground. It is an attempt (a fairly poor\none) at what the Swiss trio, the Young\nGods, do so well. The samples are solider\nand begin to break up the monotony of\nthe beat as well as adding ry th mn and an\napproach to a tone. The samples include\ncuts from Napalm Death (Lee Dorrian's grunts) and other slab by riffs/feedback\nfrom other sources\u2014including other\nEarache bands.\nDespite the relatively good B side the\nrecord is wholly unoriginal, besides the\nYoung Gods do it better.\nSeb\nHappy\nMondays\nT ne Sisters Of Mercy\nWembley Arena\nShaun was pissed off. Shaun 'I'm always\npissed off Ryder was more pissed off\nthan usual. Shaun was pissed off because\nhe couldn't hear himself. Shaun was not\nalone because me and a few thousand\nothers couldn't hear him either. His voice\nwas buried somewhere beneath the well\nof sound created by:\na) the pulsating bass and drums that is\nthe Mondays' trademark. A sound that\nwill make even the most involuntary feet\nmove solely because everything within a fifteen mile radius, be it animal, mineral\nor vegetable, is moving as well.\nb) the awful acoustics within the arena.\nBez was happy. Bez the non-playing,\nnon-singing car n vial clown, the self-styled\nMondays' cheerleader was happy because\nhe is worshipped by a million b aggies. Bez raises his left hand and they scream.\nBez raises his right hand and they\nscream. Bez shakes his left test a cle and\nthe first fifteen rows of the arena cream\nthemselves in una dour ned adulation.\nIt is Bez who keeps the show rolling\nbetween songs whilst Shaun lights\nanother pissed off cigarette by shaking his\nmaracas. He is assisted in this\noccasionally by the pl as to rubber clad girl\nsinger, who one minute 'is' sitting on the\ndrum riser, delving into her handbag for\nlipstick and powder puff, the next, she is\nbent in front of Bez with cheeks thrust at\nthe audience licking his erect percussion.\nThe set lasted roughly an hour. Quite\nenough time to leave me deaf in one ear.\nAll the fave s were there, finishing with\nthe monstrously brilliant Wrote for Luck.\nFor an encore we were treated to\nShaun decking the keyboard player and\nbeing held back by his father (part of the\ncrew).

It was\nalso, inevitably, 'beneath them' to da in to\ngrant me an interview, being now so\n'prestigious', to quote the a fore mentioned, bigot ted record label, and so I am unable to inform you of just how far\nShelley and other Eighteenth Century\npoets influence the elusive Eldritch\n(sample Shelley's Ozymandius alongside\nthe pop-famed Dominion, or Marian). I am also unable to convey His views on\nGeorge Bush's Vision Thing, which\nincident ly coincides with the latest\nalbum's title, an LP expression of\nAmericanism and its mythology.\nTo compound this farce, Eldritch, now\nteamed with Sigue Sigue Sputnik\nprankster, Tony James (and his 'silly\nhats'), was to have The Mothers in\nsupport. This harsh but broad sectioned\ngroup appeared more for a stage act than\nlisten ability and would be more at home\nat the mercy of Archaos than the mercy\nof the Sisters' onslaught.\nAny doubts about sell-out diversions\nwere blighted from the first notes,\nAlterhours, and the Arena was\nquad spaced back to 1985, and the fabled\nlast night at the Albert Hall. Eldritch\nHimself, the self-styled deity, hung thin\nand frail from the stand, exactly\nencapsulated as in the live video Wake,\nbut still egotistic to the fore with forced\nlowness of voice seeming so out of place\nagainst his mean form.\nThe Sisters have always been a cult\nband, revelled by the few but secretly\nadmired by the masses. It seems sad that\nso many have missed the joke. I saw one\nwhite faced lady carrying a coffin!\nThe spectacle was epic, with an\niridescent purple haze wafting between\nthe immense, rusted iron chains and\nendless classics, dating from Alice,\nthrough the drowning de spa ration of\nMarian, the pounding monotony of\nLucretia ending with the rocky monstrosity of Vision Thing.\nMore of a greatest hits parade, with no\nMore, than the traditional album\nadvertisement, the greats could not be\nmarred in their first airing since the\ngroup's dramatic split. Eldritch gave full\ndemonstration of his recently won rights\nto that shattering early material . Of\nminor disappointment were the anthems\nfrom Floodland which seemed drowned in\nblandness tonight.\nThose who were there will talk of this\nto their grand-children.\nSJH\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS\n\u2022 r> np,. \u2022 Repossessed\nCosi Fan Tutti\nIt is easy to see why the Royal\nOpera House is facing a massive\ndeficit while the ENO( nearly)\nmanages to balance its books. The ENO has not abandoned innovation entirely,\nbut obviously has a policy of staging a number of 'popular' operas each season\nwhich will guarantee near capacity\naudiences. Add to this the fact that many\nof these are revivals, which are cheaper\nthan new productions, and it becomes\nclear why they aren't blackmailing the\nArts Council into giving them larger and\nJust So\nTo walk into the Tricycle theatre is\nakin to stepping through a wardrobe into Narnia. It is a thespian oasis stuck in the heart of post\nholocaust Kilburn.\nThe auditorium itself can only be\ndescribed as Meccano for adults. Red scaffolding climbs to the ceiling and\nacross the balcony. The stage is a continuation of this superstructure thus\nmaking it split-level and utilising all the\nspace that a cosy 'back room' can offer.\nJust So (so it says) is a musical inspired\nby the stories of Rudyard Kipling. Its\ncreators, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, were the first winners of the\nVivian Ellis prize for young writers.\nThe cast have been in everything from\nZulu through to Countdown via Les\nMiserables. OK so now you know the\nbackground let's get down to the biz.\nThere's a farting, belching, 18 stone,\nNorth Yorkshire Rhino who would put\nCompo to shame. There's a giraffe with\ngreat legs and an amazing pair of\nbap s... on her bum!! There's a Kolokolo\nbird who you'd want to take home to\nmother and a Dingo who you'd want to\ntake home to the mother-in-law. There's a Kangaroo who should be world 'gur ning' champion, such are his facial expressions.\nThere's a dancing marijuana plant, honest\ng uv, and all this from a children's book!\nThe set and costumes seem to have\nbeen sponsored by Platex because of the\nprofusion of corsets, girdles and the like\n(hence the giraffe's appendages).\nThe songs are excellent, with a hint of\nlarger subsidies.\nSuch a production is this Cosi. A revival\ndating from 1980, it is a 'nice' opera. A lighthearted comedy, conventionally\nstaged, it is not going to frighten the\ncasual opera-going public in the way that,\nsay, Wozzeck or Dr Faust might.\nHaving said that, it is actually not a bad\nproduction. The set, whilst versatile in\ndepicting both inside and outside, lacks\nany real innovation or depth of thought,\nbut is an inoffensive background to the\nperformers. It is well sung, especially by\nElizabeth Gale as Despina (to be replaced\nby Lesley Garrett from 12th December).\nThe plot, concerning the testing of the\nfidelity of two sisters by their soldier\nfiance s, is easy to follow, if a little slow-moving and failing to seize all the\nopportunities to play up the farcical\nelements.\nIn short, a good workmanlike production. Its worth going to see if you don't know much about an opera, but it's not going to scare anyone, least of all the\nENO's bank manager.\nLiz W Gilbert and Sullivan (don't let this put you off). The lyrics are both sola cio us and\ncorny with references to lost cherries and\nshort and cur lies through to Rudyard\nKipling making exceedingly good cakes.\nForget pan to s. Forget Rice and Lloyd\nWebber. See this NOW. Brilliant.\nP.S.I know my grammer s crap but she\ndied five years ago.\nUnbaggy.\n\u2014Film\n\u2014Opera\n\u2014Comic/Graphics\n\u2014Theatre\n18 years ago Nancy Aglet had a demon (with a particularly silly\nvoice) exorcised by Father Mayii\n(Leslie Nielson). Then, while watching aTV evangelist show, her head spins round\nto spray her husband with chick-pea\nsoup. 'Bet its PMT', whispers one smart-arse d kid, but no\u2014she's been\nRepossessed\\ Nancy (Linda Blair, Oscar\nwinner for the first Exorcist\u2014what a coincidence^)) seeks the help of Father\nLuke Brophy, and persuades him to seek\nauthorisation for a poodle...sorry,\nexorcism. The exorcism is approved, but\non the condition that it appears on\n'Earnest and Fanny's Exorcism tonight'\u2014\nthe self same show that Nancy was\nwatching when she was Repossessed!\nAnd so starts a hilarious comedy from\nthe mould of Airplane and The Naked\nGun. Hang on a minute there, the only\ncommon link between the films\nmentioned above is Mr Nielson, where\nare the producers Abrahams and Zucker?\nThe fact has to be faced that this may be\nin the style of the aforementioned\nmovies, 'tis not from the same stable.\nDoes this matter? A little, as somewhere\nalong the line the edge of pure humour is\nlost, and occasionally this effort slips into\nmere silliness. For the most part, though,\nthis is a damn fine movie.\nThere are the visual gags we have\ncome to expect, and they hit us with such\nfrequency that you are sure that you miss\nsome of them along the way, as some of\nthem are difficult to spot, like Nancy's car\nnumber plate666 GIRL. The verbal\nhumour is rooted deeply in today'sTV and film culture, from Star Wars (May the\nFaith be with you, Luke) to the Rocky\nfilms. The unfortunate locker room\nsequence is straight out of a Carry On\nmovie and best forgotten. The priests\nmake fools of themselves, the world's religious leaders get a chase scene, the\npoodle (yes, there is one) gets minced and\nthe Devil gets all the best lines.\nNot quite up to Naked Gun standard\n(worry not, Naked Gun 2'A is coming) but\nprobably the funniest movie released in a while.\nPendragon.6 "

This is achieved by the following method:\nYou award a1( solely a1 not a tick or X or any other\nsmudge) to the candidate who, in your opinion, is best. You can stop there or award a2 to the next best candidate, 3 to\nthe next and so on depending on how many candidates there\nare, including New Election.\nThere are a few parts to remember otherwise you will void\nyour paper. There can only be numbers on the paper, they\nmust start at 1, they must be sequenced and not represent an\nequal preference.\nOn the paper there is a choice marked New Election. If you vote 1 for this option you make a statement that the candidate\nis unsuitable for the job.

    "content": "Don Adlington invites expedition proposals for next year.\nExploration'919 FELIX\nIt's easy to forget that the long\nvacation\u2014a clear three months of\nfreedom to do what you will\u2014is a highly\nfinite resource. Few people ever again\nhave such opportunities, once the\ndemands and responsibility of career and\nfamily become major factors in life. For\nthirty-five years, the IC Exploration Board\nhas encouraged students to think about a particularly rewarding\u2014not to say exotic,\nway of using this time\u2014by participation\nin expedition activity, and there is\nscarcely a region on the earth's surface\nwhich has not been traversed by Imperial\nCollege expeditions, by one means or\nanother. Many hundreds of students have\ntaken part, in an enormous variety of\nactivities.\nWht sort of things do people do? Some\nexamples from the past two years! There\nhave been two, separate, life sciences\nexpeditions to Papua New Guinea, with\nprojects on ants, rats, cockroaches and\nwood-rotting fungi. Three other groups\nundertook a variety of ecological projects\nin the rain-forests of Ecuador, Bolivia, and\nGuyana. There have been four\nmountaineering expeditions to the\nKarakoram, the Andes and to Mount\nKenya, three of them combining climbing\nwith a variety of scientific projects. Two other projects involved very demanding\ntrekking and running over difficult terrain\nin Nepal and the Karakoram. A Caving\nClub expedition carried out cave\nexploration in the Dominican Republic.\nThe possibilities, clearly, are endless.\nThere is no reason, of course, why students should not go off and do exciting\nthings in far-flung corners of the world\nentirely without reference to the College,\nand very many do so. If the intention is\nto have an expedition, however, as\nopposed to an adventurous holiday, there\nare we believe some big advantages in\nusing the Exploration Board. In the first\nplace expeditions gaining the Board's formal recognition have the status of\nofficial College ventures, and many use\nthe College's name and considerable\nreputation in this field in their approaches\nto other organisations for help. They will\nhave easy access to the body of expertise\navailable in the College, and to eminent\nauthorities in a wide variety of settings\noutside the College. The Board's approval\nalmost invariably carries with it a monetary grant, and many expeditions\nborrow equipment from the Board's stock. The Board also ensures proper\ninsurance cover, at no cost to the\nstudents themselves.\nThe disadvantage\u2014if such it be\u2014of\nseeking Exploration Board support is that\nthere is a certain degree of formality\ninvolved. Expeditions are expected to\nsubmit coherent proposals, with well\ndefined objectives, and on return, a comprehensive report. The Board's Treasurer maintains a degree of control\nover expeditions' financial accounts, and\nover insurance matters.\nIf you have the germ of an idea\u2014you\ndon't need much more than that to begin\nwith\u2014we would be very glad to discuss it\nwith you at an early stage. Simply ring\nDr Schroter (Chairman) on int 4083, or\nme on int 3041. The Board has the first\nof its two formal meetings, at which\nmembers of proposed expeditions are\ninterviewed, on Wednesday December\n5\u2014but we need to have proposals before\nthen, so that they can be circulated to\nmembers beforehand.\nDon Adlington. College Day Imperial College, perhaps the greatest\nconcentration of small businesses in West\nLondon, is now coming to terms with its\ngreatest malaise, students. Finding that\nthe 'academics' are finding that there is\nlittle time for the more lucrative research\nor private-venture markets, they are now\ntrying to find more time to fit the kids\ninto an already expensive schedule.\nThere are so many arguments against\nthis proposal, you could be forgiven in\nthinking that the cumulative feelings\ndictate a severe waste of man-hours in\nconsidering it in the first place. You have\nalready considered the inconveniences;\ntiredness; lack of time of extra-curricular\nactivities; an earlier entry into the\nLondon rush-hour etc. I hope to bring to\nyour attention a few that may have\nalready escaped your attention.\nIt will be difficult to imagine how four\nmorning lectures are not going to be\nscheduled. Even if all the precautions are\ntaken, students will still be left with\nspurious gaps in their day. These will be\ndifficult to fill, since the real working time\navailable will be short after students\nmove from the theatre and settle down\nagain to study. In addition, with the\neducation of one's mind being a strenuous\nand tiring exercise especially with the\nincreased knowledge that is put upon\nscience students as technology advances.\nSurely, this warrants an increase in\nSpenser Lane presents a student's view. The Rector,\nwho convened the working party on changes to the\nCollege day, felt it inappropriate to write an article at\nthis time.\nproduce.\nTwo final comments on the anatomy\nand terms of reference of the working\nparty. I should have thought the inclusion\nof reps from the humanities department\nand the management school would have\nbeen invaluable. Their experience on\nnon-scientific and time-management issues\nseemed to be overlooked! In addition,\nshouldn't the issue of the forth-coming\nentry into Europe of the degree courses\nhave been a prime consideration, with\nthat year becoming an ideal opportunity\nto realise the education of the student so\nfar!\npractical leisure time to recuperate.\nClubs will be severely affected by the\nproposal of staggering lunches. It will be\nnigh impossible for the clubs that have to\nmeet in lunchtime for administration\npurposes, if half of their committee\nmembers are not there! If Imperial\nCollege feels an obligation to further the\nhumanities options (as it should), should it\nnot feel equally obliged to assist the\nclubs, which provide the most enjoyable\nway for science students to diversify.\nPersonally, I perceive the problem to be\nthe fault of the departments for the\norganisation of their degree courses, if it\nfeels that there is not enough time. Some\ndepartments repeat material, not\nspecifically to refresh a student's education, but more importantly because\nthe material covered was badly taught\noriginally, or due to a breakdown in\ncommunications between option lecturers.\nThe total lecture hours lost over a three\nyear degree must be colossal. Therefore,\nwhen the degrees change to four year\ncourses, this will only make the problem\nworse. Some of the blame must also lie\nwithin College, or not giving the\ndepartments effective guidelines. Maybe\nsuggesting that all departments should not\naim to finish at 12.30pm, will assist that\ngreat bastion of the catering world,\nCollege Refectories, in coping with the\nextraordinary demand it has with its\nCHRISTMAS CAROL\nSERVICE\nCome and join in the Christmas spirit,\nThursday 6th December at 5.45pm in\nHoly Trinity Church, Prince Consort\nRoad (next door to Beit Quad).\nEveryone is most warmly welcome.\nOrganised jointly by the West London\nChaplaincy and the West London\nCatholic Chaplaincy. All proceeds to\nthe 'cornerstone community' in West\nBelfast.\n\n"

For a Palestinian, however, a great deal of the\ninformation only serves to increase the\ndeep rooted sense of denial and injustice.\nI have here selected certain comments\nreleased by the Barbican, followed by my response to them.\nIsrael has a population of only just over\nfour million, living on a twenty thousand\nsquare kilometre strip of land.\nIn addition, since 1967, Israel occupies\n6,400 sq km of the West Bank, 362 sq km of the Gaza Strip, as well as parts of the\nSyrian Golan Heights, and parts of\nsouthern Lebanon. In the West Band and\nGaza Strip, nearly two million Palestinians\nlive under the longest military occupation\nof a country in modern history.\nIsrael publishes more books per head of\npopulation than any other country in the\nworld.\nIsrael also censors more books per head\nof population than many other countries\nin the world.\nBeit Shean in the Galilee has the\nworld's biggest Roman amphitheatre.\nBeit Shean in the Galilee also has one\nof the biggest refugee populations. In\n1948, the Israeli army ordered the\nexpulsion of the entire Palestinian\npopulation of the Bisan. They and their\ndescendants have been stateless refugees\nfor over four decades.\nThe annual 10-day Jerusalem Film\nFestival shows over 100 films from over\nforty countries in the Jerusalem\nCinemateque, op post ie Mount Zion.\nPalestinian theatres and cultural\nestablishments, however, are repeatedly\nordered to shut by the Israeli occupation\nauthorities and many artists harassed and\nimprisoned.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls, Bethlehem, the\nGarden of Gethsemane, the Sea of\nGalilee, the Wailing Wail and King\nSolomon's Mines are all alive and well in\nIsrael!\nAre you a budding\nDavid\nAttenborough,\nBellemy or\nJonathan Porrit?\nWe need Environmental articles.\nCan you justify working in the\nchemical, mining or oil\nindustries when they have such\nhorrific environmental records?\nIs your industry and the\nenvironment compatible?\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls were not found in\nIsrael; Bethlehem is not in Israel; nor the\nGarden of Gethsemane; nor the Wailing\nWall; nor Jericho. Legally, they are all\nlocated in occupied Palestinian territories.\nIsrael's many exports include flowers to\nthe Netherlands, chocolate to Switzerland\nand citrus to the USA.\nIsrael's many exports also include\nbodyguards to Nicaragua's toppled\ndictator Somoza, intelligence advisors to\nPanama's toppled dictator Noriega;\nnuclear know-how, arms, electronics and\nintelligence training to Apartheid South\nAfrica.\nIsrael's citizens hail from over 80\ncountries across the globe.\nAnd settled there on lands expropriated\nfrom Palestinians, as well as in the houses\nof Palestinians who were forcibly expelled\nin 1948 and 1967 and live in refugee\ncamps or are exiled to over 80 countries\nthroughout the world.\nThe Machtesh Ramon Crater in\nSouthern Israel is 300m deep and 8km wide. It is one of the world's biggest\ncrater-canyons with rock strata and fossils\ndating back 200 million years.\nIt is also adjacent to the illegal Israel\nDimonah Reactor. Israel is the only\ncountry in the Middle East that is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (1968) and refused to open its\nDimonah nuclear plant to international\ninspection by the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency( IAEA).\nIt is known to have an illegal arsenal of\nover 200 atomic warheads and probably\nthermo-nuclear warheads as revealed by\nthe Mordechai Vanunu, serving an\n18-year prison sentence for doing so.\nThe huge immigration of Russian\nJewish doctors, scientists and engineers\nspells a better future for Israel's economy\u2014increasing the number of\nIsrael's engineers from 30,000 to 160,000.\nWhile the Israeli government opens its\ndoors to Soviet Jewish immigrants, many\nPalestinians are foci bly 'transferred'\npermanently out of the country to join\nthe thousands already in exile. Their\nproperties and lands are confiscated and\nexpropriated for further exclusively\nJewish settlements.\nIsrael is a country with a distinct\nMediterranean flavour and a vibrant\noutdoor life, but where streets are empty\nwhen Dallas is on TV.\nThe Occupied Palestinian Territories\nhave a distinct Mediterranean fl v our and\na vibrant outdoor life, but their streets\nempty when the Israeli occupation army\nimposes entire curfews over entire cities\nand neighbourhoods often for periods of\nmany weeks at a time.\nJericho, whose first fortifications were\nbuilt 9000 years ago, is the oldest and\nlowest city on earth.\nJericho is not in Israel. Jericho is a city\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n70% of Palestinians are under the age\nof 30 years.\nMore than 70% of Palestinians under\nthe age of 30 are denied education\nbecause of closure of Kindergartens,\nschools and universities by the Israeli\noccupation authorities. Thousands of\nPalestinians (many babies in cots) have\nbeen killed by the Israeli army.\nIn the Jewish Mea Shearim quarter of\nJerusalem, the ultra orthodox residents\nwill wear the fur hats and silk kaftans of\nthe 16th century Polish middle class.\nMany of them also regard Zionism and\nthe establishment of the Jewish state of\nIsrael as the worst form of Jewish\napostasy; they refuse to pay taxes to the\nZionist state, to serve in the Israeli army\nor to carry Israeli passports. On the\nofficial day of the establishment of the\nstate of Israel (15 May), they stage annual\nprotest demonstrations, where they burn\nthe Israeli flag as an expression of their\nopposition to Zionism and to the\nestablishment of the state of Israel as a Jewish state.\nVAN\nBOOKINGS\nThe deadline for\nChristmas and New\nYear van bookings is\n5.30pm on Monday\n3rd December.

    "content": "Scribblers' Corner.. Dab\nPear 5'w LETTERS\nDear FELIX,\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you very much for publishing articles by Chris\nRiley on China. At the time when the\nWest are celebrating the liberation of\nEastern Europe and the end of the Cold\nWar, the Chinese cause is sadly being\nlargely forgotten. Chris Riley has rightly\npresented an in-depth study and a firsthand experience in China. It is of great\nvalue to the international community at\nIC and in particular to Chinese students\nwho are anxious to obtain any\ninformation about their home country.\nHowever, through a letter by Jason\nPike, I found pure nei ve ty and utter\nignorance. History seems to be distorted\nin Pike's hand and everything has to\nshow blood in his red eyes. Most of the\nChinese students at IC have stood up\nfrom the Cultural Revolution and involved\nthemselves in the ten years of reform to\nsome extent, It was only from the\nunderstanding that Cultural Revolution\nhas nearly destroyed China and\nCommunism is not working have we been\ndetermined to rebuild China for a fairer,\nfreer and more democratic society.\nDuring the time of the Nationalist\ngovernment of China, the question was\nhow much liberty may be allowed.\nHowever, with the Communist\ngovernment when everything is under\nparty control, the question becomes\nwhether we have liberty or not.\nIntellectuals have been purged again and\nagain. Workers are under strict political\ndiscipline (not working discipline) and if\nanything happens, they are the first to be\nused or to be punished. The worst\nhappens in the countryside where there is\nWhat'sOn no social welfare system\u2014the trademark\nof socialism\u2014at all and yet more than\n80% of the population live there. The\npeasants provide the state with cheap\nfood and every now and then millions die\nof starvation due to mismanagement.\nJason Pike needs to be reminded that\nhe is free to publish his letter here or in\nthe future free China but should the word 'capitalism' in his final paragraph be\nreplaced by 'communism' as follows:\nBy giving some people power over\nothers, the state created the opportunity\nDabble\nDear FELIX,\nThe writer of one of your articles\n'Tiananmen: Riot or Massacre' chose\ninterviewees with a sadly patronising\nattitude towards the ordinary people of\ntheir country. Whoever said that pressure\nfor political democracy is right for\nEastern Europe but not China because\n'People in Eastern European countries\nhave better democratic minds than the\nChinese people', was effectively saying\nthat he or she thought the Chinese people\ndon't have the right to determine their\nown future because they are too stupid or\ntoo ignorant to agree with him or her.\nThe admiration expressed for the\ninfluence of capitalist countries, is\nmisplaced. Are not Taiwan and South\nKorea capitalist countries? There, the\nexploitation of the working class is more\nsevere than in Western Europe because\nthe State has more power to enforce it.\nSome people call the market-directed\nfor personal corruption. The state, low\nwages and high prices are necessary to\ncreate the profits that communism (the\nexploitation of people by a parasitic\nruling elite) demands. But communism is\nnot necessary.\nThen most people may find more truth\nin it and he would have to spend a few\ngood years in jail if the letter were made\npublic in a, however small, circle in\nChina.\nYours sincerely,\nMing Ri.\nform of capitalism 'economic freedom' or\n'the free market'. But it does not provide\nfreedom for people of any class. Just to\nsurvive and maintain our position, we all\nhave to fulfil the demands of the market,\nand many people are press uri sed to\nquench the caring side of their nature to\ncompete. Since our economic and political\nenvironment inevitably determine the\nrange of choices available to us, humanity\nwill not be free until we control politics\nand the economy. In the Soviet Union,\nwhere the people are striving to si eze political power, so the economy is being\ntaken out of political control and into\nprivate ownership by the ruling class.\nThis process is a threat to all potential\nnew democracies; people should insist on the right to run their own workplace\n(circumventing the State which is\ncumbersome and corrupt).\nAnyone who ideal is es 'capitalist\ndemocracies' is looking at them through\ncontinued overleaf\nAN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS IN AND AROUND IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nFRIDAY\nHang Gliding 12.30pm Southside Upper Lounge.

    "content": "All you wanted to know about Alumnus Day but were afraid\nto ask.\nAlumnus Day 'What day?' I hear you say. Well Alumnus\nDay is a day when the College welcomes\nback former students and staff who come\nto see how the College, their department\nand friends are faring. An opportunity to\nvisit laboratories, see current research\nand talk to you, the current stud ej it population.\nThe festivities continue into the evening\nwith the Alumni Dinner, the College\nChoir Concert. Links are holding their\nChristmas Dinner and all Tie Clubs are\nstaging a reunion in the evening. This\nyear a special invite has been extended\nto alumni from the years 1930, 40, 50,\n60, 70, 80 and 90. So if you have a free\nmoment on Friday afternoon and see a bewildered alumnus, why not give he or\nshe a hand (after all for many of our\nalumni the campus has changed\nphysically beyond all recognition). You are also very welcome to visit areas of\nyour department you may not yet have\nseen or even other departments which\nopen from 2.00pm. But why are we doing all this? Well it's part of a wider programme of Alumni Relations. Once, upon graduation that\nwas the last you heard of your College.\nNow twice a year you can get updates of\nnews, research and events at Imperial\nfrom the Annual Report and the alumni\nnewsletter IC Matters. What else do the\nalumni get from this relationship?\nThe speed of development in science\nand technology means that most of what\nis learnt during your degree is out of date\nwithin 10 years of graduation. It is a wise\ngraduate who remains in contact with his\nCollege which is after all a pioneer in\nmany of these fields.\nNetworking with fellow alumni can also\nkeep you abreast of developments in\nyour field, solve technical problems,\nstrike up partnerships, enable you to\nbreak into new fields. Our recently\npublished Address Books along with our\ncomprehensive database can help you\ncontact other Alumni. Visiting Hong Kong, Zambia, Bulgaria?\nWe re in contact with alumni in 184\ncountries. Some have their own alumni\nassociations and more are being set up.\nSo if you're going to work, live or travel\nto far flung corners of the planet we can\nput you in touch with some friendly\nfaces.\nReunions is perhaps the traditional role\nof alumni relations and is still one of the\nmost important. If after 5, 10 or more\nyears you're wondering what has\nhappened to old friends we can not only\nprovide up to date addresses but also\nhelp you organise it.\nWell what about the College. How does\nshe benefit? Newspapers are full of stories\nof restrictions on higher education, staff-student ratio, student loans,...Your\nequipment is becoming out dated. You may be worried that the reaction you get\nwhen introducing yourself as an Imperial\ngraduate will become less glorious if new\nresources aren't found to continue the\nCollege's reputation for excellence. To\nhelp alleviate some of these problems all\nalumni are given the opportunity to\ncontribute to the Alumni fund which will\ngo towards student accommodation,\ngrants and young lectureship s. The\nChemical Engineering Department has\nalso just launched its Jubilee Appeal the\nfunds of which will go towards\nundergraduate teaching facilities.\nThis is an update of the work of the\nAlumnus Office in brief. One day you too\nwill be one of our alumni, so if you want\nto find out more feel free to visit us in\nRoom354 Sherfield. We may even be\nable to help you while you are still in\nCollege.\nTrainee Actuaries\nWith your\nhead for\nfigures,\nyou figure\nhighly in\nthe way\nahead.\nWhat goes on inside your head is important to\nus. Not just the theories, st rate gems and hypotheses, but how all those things get put into practice.\nYour ideas are tomorrow's innovations. You have the\npower and the potential not only to change the way\nahead for yourself, but also to change the way\nahead for the European Community's largest mutual\nlife assurance company.\nStandard Life is a progressive place. We are\nalways adding to our strengths and taking away all\nthe honours in the business of financial services.\nOur structured training programmes, dynamic working environment and exceptional rewards are a formula for success on anyone's blackboard, which\nis why we succeed in attracting some of the best\nactuarial trainees in the UK {relatively speaking).\nWe like-the individual thinker. The maverick.\nThe graduate with creative flair and an eye for the\nunusual. We want you to experiment and we want\nto set tasks that, at first, you think are impossible,\nbut in the end you are able to work out.\nThe way ahead is never easy. But, all things\nbeing equal, having good people with good heads\non their shoulders, we'll figure out the best route.\nStandard Life will be visiting your university in\nthe near future, for more information and a graduate\nbrochure, call in at your careers office.\nStandardLife\nWe don't follow standards.We set them.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nThis is the man who put his money on red and it came up black,\nthis is the man who drives a C5.\nSinclair's spectrum On Wednesday next week, Sir Clive\nSinclair is expected to give a lecture in\nthe Physics department, lecture theatre 1\nat 1.15 pm.\nSir Clive is the man who brought into\nthe world such delights as the digital\nwatch, the pocket calculator, the home\ncomputer and the infamous C5 electric\nvehicle. But where did all this start?\nClive Sinclair came across the world of\nelectronics when he was 13 years old,\nand started constructing radios. He soon\nmanaged to build a radio that was\nsmaller than a matchbox, which was\ndeclared by experts to be unworkable. At the time he had his own company,\nSinclair Radionics, selling transistors for\nradio enthusiasts. However, it was his\nminiature radio, sold as a kit, that caused\nhis business to flourish.\nSinclair turned his attention to the\ncalculator. At the time, the only\nelectronic calculators were desktop\nmodels that consumed lar^e amounts of\npower. Experiments showed that the\nsilicon chip used in these machines did\nnot need to be supplied with power\ncontinuously, so he designed circuitry that\nswitched the power rapidly on and off.\nWith this advance, he was able to launch\na pocket-sized calculator, because the\nbatteries required could be much smaller.\nThe calculator, like his miniature radios,\nwas very successful, and was sold all\nround the world.\nIt was in the late 1970s that Sinclair\nturned his attention to microcomputers,\nthat were just beginning to be used in\nbusinesses. He reckoned that there might\nbe a market for such devices in peoples'\nhomes as well as their offices. He formed\na new company, Sinclair Research, in\n1979, and in 1980 the ZX80 was\nlaunched. This was a small black box\nwith a rubber keyboard, that used the\ndomestic television as the visual display\nunit, and a standard cassette recorder as\nthe method for storing data. This was\nfollowed in 1981 by an upgraded version,\nthe ZX81. This was the first computer\nthat many people experienced and used.\nAs with the ZX80, it was cheap and very\npowerful by the then-current standard.\nIn 1982 the Sinclair Spectrum was\nintroduced. The name 'Spectrum' came\nfrom the fact that it was capable of\nproducing colour images, as opposed to\nthe black-and-white of the ZX series. This\ncomputer, in upgraded form, is still on\nsale today.\nA fourth computer, the Sinclair QL, went on sale in 1984, targeted primarily\nat small business users. However, it was\nnot particularly successful, probably\nbecause it was incompatible with the IBM\nPC. As with his other computers, the\nkeyboard was not like that of an electric\ntypewriter, and this was another possible\nreason why it did not sell well.\nThe next major project of Sinclair was\nthe development of electric vehicles, the\nfirst (and last?) of which was the infamous\nC5. Whereas other people were\nattempting to improve battery technology\nbefore building electric cars, Sinclair\ndecided to use available batteries, but to\nconcentrate on the design of the car.\nInstead of using a powerful motor for\ngood acceleration, he aimed to minimise\nthe weight and so on.\nHowever, when the C5 was launched, it\nfailed to meet the claimed performance:\ninstead of having a range of 100 miles\nper battery charge, owners were lucky to\nget 30, and only that if it was pedalled up\nany hill in the offing. There were\nproblems about whether owners needed\nto be licensed to used it on roads, and\nwhether children would be allowed to\n'drive' them. Most people came to the\nconclusion that a bicycle was cheaper,\nfaster and safer.\nSince the failure of the C5, Sir Clive has\nsunk out of the public eye, although he is\nstill working on new ideas. He retains\ninterest in the prospects for electrical\nvehicles, claiming that they will produce\nless pollution than petrol-driven vehicles.\nMany find this difficult to believe, because\nthe pollution is only transferred from\ntowns to the surrounds of power stations.\nDespite the greater efficiency of power\nstations, energy is lost along transmission\nlines, and in the charging of batteries to\npower the vehicles. In addition there is\nthe weight of the batteries, which limits\nthe performance of such vehicles. If more\ncells are used to provide a better range,\nthen energy is used to transport that\nextra weight, so reducing overall\nefficiency: a vicious circle.\nMore recently, Sinclair has been\nworking on light, fold able bicycles.\nAccording to New Scientist, these bicycles\nwill be made entirely of fibrous materials\n(such as Kevlar) instead of the traditional\nsteel or alloy frame and components. It\nwas not known whether a traditional\nchain drive or pneumatic tyres would be\nused, although the riding position will be\nconventional. One problem that he must\nhave is making the frame strong enough\nto resist the twisting forces of hard\npedalling.\n14\n\n"

    "content": "Da Capo\nDear Sir,\nI would like to suggest that Imperial\nCollege Union and all its members do not\nin any way get involved in a campaign\nthat would support taking human life and\nparticularly abortion.\nFirstly, the human embryo and foetus is\nan individual from conception. From this\npoint on( s) he has a unique DNA structure\nand grows according to its own biological\nset up. As an individual the embryo or\nfoetus should be given the rights of any\nhuman especially and fore mostly the right\nto live. Women do have rights but, like\nmen, these rights do not include\ntermination of innocent human life on demand. This attitude is one of pure\nselfishness and thinking only of one's own comfort and convenience. It is\nunfortunate that there is so little concern\nfor the innocent and helpless in the world\ntoday.\nSecondly, God created man after His\nown image and to abuse that is an\nabomination of his holy sight. We are to\nhave the same concern for other\nindividuals as we have for our own bodies. The Bible puts it this way, 'Love\nthe Lord your God with all your heart\nand with all your soul and with all your\nmind'. This is the first and greatest\ncommandment. And the second is like it,\n'Love your neighbour as yourself.' By the\nword 'neighbour', Christ means all\nmankind, the fact that we have such a low view of other people's welfare is\nanother mark of the way sin has bondage\nover this world. It is sin that separates us\nfrom the perfect and holy God and as all\nhave sinned, all deserve the just\nWhat'sOn penalty\u2014death alone. However, praise\nGod that He has not left us in this\nhopeless state but presented His Son,\nJesus Christ, as the only sufficient\nsacrifice to pay for sin, so that,\n'whosoever believes in Him will not\nperish but will have eternal life'. (John\n3:16).\nEven though, Christ has paid the\npenalty for the sin of the elect, we all\nhave the responsibility to seek to follow\nthe moral law which teaches us to think\nof others before ourselves. It is in this\nspirit that I urge the IC Women's Officer\nnot to encourage the availability of\nDacca\nDear Chris,\nIt is a bit hard to know where to start,\nhave never heard so much drivel in all\nmy life, that is since Konrad Pagenstert's letter. The 3 critics (Felix 884) obviously\nnever read my letter properly.\nI will start with Darren Austin's letter:\nWell I don't need to look up 'bigoted,\nxenophobic or sycophant,' however you\nbetter look up 'intolerance' since you\nspelt it with 2 l's. I don't revel in war. I respect and admire those who gave their\nlives so the rest of us might enjoy the\nfreedom that we all have. The reason\nwhy I kept my argue ment fixed on\nJapanese at tro cities was simply because\nmy letter was attacking Prince Charles'\nvisit to Japan. There was no point in\nmentioning South Africa since the Prince\nwasn't even going to the same continent.\nabortion in this country, nor protest at a perfectly just law in another nation. May we all divert our attention to preserving\nGod's creation to His glory.

    "content": "Southwell Ceiling Collapse\nTwo weeks ago a ceiling in Southwell\nHouse, Evelyn Gardens, collapsed while\none of the residents was in the room. She\nhad just stood up from her desk and\nturned to walk across the room when the\nplaster 'fell down in front of my eyes'.\nShe said that if her room mate had either\nbeen working at her desk, getting\nsomething from the wardrobe or entering\nthe room then she would have been hit\nby the falling plaster.\nThe area of ceiling that fell had just\nrecently been painted to match in with\nthe rest of the room as only two years\nago a similar incident occured. At that\ntime the problem was solved by patching\nthe lost area of plaster and not replacing\nthe whole ceiling of the room. This\noperation will again be employed as the\ncost for patching the area is only about\n\u00a3130, under a quarter of the cost of a full\nrepair job.\nJoe Dines, from Estates, who is dealing\nwith the situation said that the problem\nhad arisen because of water leaking\nthrough the floor from the kitchen above\nthe room. He had been informed that\ncleaners were leaving the freezers turned\noff at night to defrost them. Water\npoured out of the freezers and passed\nthrough the unsound vinyl floor, soaking\nthe ceiling below. Mr Dines has written to\nPeter Leeson about the situation and\nasked him to stop the cleaners from\ndefrosting the fridges in this manner.\nMr Dines believes that the solution to\nthe problem has now been found and\nthat repairs to the kitchen floor will start\nthis morning. After the weekend, when\nthe ceiling of the room will have had\ntime to dry, work will begin on the patch.\nAllowing for the plaster and then the\npaint to dry, Mr Dines said that the\nresidents would be able to move back in\nnext weekend 'for definite'.\nA contractor from the builders Alick\nWhittle, on inspecting the ceiling said that\nthe whole area should be replaced. Mr Dines however said that he was not going\nto spend \u00a3 6 0 0 on a job that can be done\nfor around \u00a3 1 3 0 . The warden of\nSouthwell House, Ken Young, said that 'Iam not in a position to judge Joe Dines\nprofessional opinion' about the ceiling but\nthat he would be very keen to see an\nindependent contractors opinion. He also\nstated that he thought that this would put\nthe minds of the residents at rest.\nMr Young was also worried that the\nreason given for the incident may be\nvalid on this occasion but that no reasons\nhad been given for the problem in the\nsame room two years ago. Even if the\ntrouble was recurring this does not\nexplain a similar but far more serious\nevent that happened in the room opposite\nwhich also occured two years ago. The\nresident of that room went to the toilet at\n2.00am and on returning two minutes\nlater found a mass of debris spread over\nthe floor of the room and his bed. He\nadded that he felt the 'excuses do seem\nto wearing a bit thin.'\nSecurity Round Up Pav out A case of indecent exposure in the\nPhysics Library has been reported. The\nincident took place at 2.00pm by a man described as 'white, well built, 5' 9\", in\nhis late 20's with dark brown hair, a very\nsmart brown leather jacket and blue\njeans'. Any information should be given\nto Terry Briley, Security Officer, on 3370.\nTwo more cycles have been stolen this\nweek, again not coded. The police are\ninterested in setting up another coding\nsession next term if there is any demand.\nPlease ring Security on 3370 if you are\ninterested in safeguarding your\npossessions in this way. From next Monday, Security will be\nenforcing parking regulations more\nstrictly due to increased building work.\nDepartments are asked to arrange\ntemporary authorisation for any visitors\nby phoning Security 24 hours in advance.\nMr Briley commented that he had 'just\nbought four more clamps.'\nFall Out\nThe Harlington Trustees have decided\nthat \u00a350,000 a year will be released to\nsports clubs. On Wednesday they decided\nthat \u00a317,000 would be given to the\nSailing Club to buy six new boats and\n\u00a315,000 to Gliding Club to go towards a new two seater glider.\nNick Lay, Captain of the Gliding Club,\nsaid that the new glider would cost\n\u00a345,000, 'improving Gliding club facilities\nno end' and making gliding 'more\naccessible to more students.'\nThe Nude Kamikaze Parachute Jump last\nSaturday raised over \u00a3390. Andrew from\nMaths raised \u00a3 1 7 0 , Chub from Mech Eng raised \u00a3 8 0 and Steve and James, also\nfrom Mech Eng, raised over \u00a3 7 0 each.\nThe Mines Dirty Disco last Monday was\nenjoyed by all involved. Steve Farrant,\nRag Organiser, said that the event had\nraised approximately \u00a3 2 5 0 , adding that\nthis was '\u00a3250 more than last year'.\nGuild's Carnival last Friday made a small loss, though the two bands, The Bogus Brothers and Friends of Harry,\nwent down well. Warwick Mullen, Guild's Treasurer, said that the loss was due to a poor turnout and the Rugby Club not\nselling out of cocktails. He said that the\nloss would only amount to tens of pounds\nand added that Guilds would not be going\nto Rag for any money.\nimperial college ents. presents\nlive in the union lounge\nfriday30 th november\ndoors open 9pm bar till lam disco till 2am tickets available from i.e. union office\n\u00a31.50 with ents card\n\u00a32.50 advance,\u00a33.00 door\nimperial college,prince consort road,lon dort, sw7 "

    "content": "Blur, young and pretty are definitely the\nmusic press darlings of the moment, with\ndescriptions ranging from 'four knowing\nbowl-heads' to 'tediously good-looking and\npointlessly brilliant.' On it's release, their\nfirst single, She's So High was Single Of\nThe Week in both Sounds and NME, and\nthey have had several favourable\ninterviews in most of the music papers.\nBlur are Daman Al burn( vocals),\nGraham Green (guitar, backing vocals)\nAlex James (bass) and Dave Rowntree\n(drums), and have been together for\nabout a year and a half. Daman, Graham\nand Dave met at school in Colchester,\nwhile Alex met Graham at Goldsmith's College where he was studying French\n(and looking for a band to join) and\nGraham was studying Fine Art. Needless\nto say, due to the band's sudden success\nthey have dropped out. Alex did have\nambitions to study Physics, but these\nwere put to an end when he failed his\nA' Level. On being asked about their musical\ninfluences they replied '60s', but wouldn't actually name any artists, and their views\non the current music scene were almost\nas vague. 'There's a lot of good bands\naround at the moment.' Eventually,\nGraham did admit to looking forward to\nthe new MBV LP( 'What new LP?' we\nasked - '1 dunno!').\nLater at the bar, as the band consumed\ntheir favourite drink - Pernod with lots of\nwater - Alex did tell us that he used to\nlike The Pixies, but wasn't impressed by\nthe new album. He also appeared to be a bit of a Lush fan and told us how he had\nonce proposed to Miki when he was a bit\npissed. Not surprisingly her reply is\nunprintable.\nThey were signed to Food in March,\nafter playing several high profile London\ngigs - no sending off demo tapes to\nmillions of record companies for this lot.\nWe had heard that they give riotous live\nperformances, which we later found to be\nmore athletic than riotous. Daman's stage\nantics have nearly broken his nose, and\nhave given him a bad neck - which he\nmoaned about throughout the interview.\nGraham (who studied Fine Arts) has\ndone some artwork which may or may\nnot be used in the future, but he seemed\nquite happy with the arrangements at\nFood. 'Basically two blok es sit down with\nus, and we tell them exactly what we\nwant and they get it done.' However, the\nartwork for She's So High (a naked\nwoman straddling a hippo pot amo us) has\ncaused controversy at various University\ngigs around the country - with Warwick actually banning all sales of their\nmerchandise. They expressed surprise\nthat UL U had not made any complaints.\nReported in Sounds to be a bit of a drug band, they denied this, but giggled\nsomething about Alex having hassles with\nhis mother after she had read that\nparticular article. They are a bit taken\naback by the auspicious attention they've\nbeen getting recently, but say they are\nprepared for the future s lagging s off.\nDaman pondered that if they continued\nwith their present standard, he couldn't see why the music press would turn\nnasty. Alex also felt that they hadn't received enough coverage yet. 'We've\nappeared in the music papers, now we\nwant to be on the covers!'\nBlur are recording their new (and\nsecond) single next week, although they\nh avn' t decided on it yet - it is due to be\nreleased on January 22nd, closely\nfollowed by an album in February or\nMarch.\nOn admitting this was our first attempt\nat an interview (and yes, we were shit\nscared) the conversation led on to other\ninterviews they've had. Most were\nconducted by older journalists in the pub,\nwhere they've felt at an advantage, but\nthey found being interviewed by a19 year-old girl from Smash Hits\n'frightening'.And talking of Smash Hits,\nthey were looking forward to the Smash\nHits Party later on that night.\nAnd now to the gig - their set of 13\nsongs included their single She's So High\nKnow which sounded so much be ter live\n(you may remember that we weren't too\ncomplimentary about it a few weeks\nback). Another song, Retention sounded\nso mush like She's So High that it should\nhave been called Repetition (but less of\nthe b itchiness!). Daman sang bittersweet lyrics over the\ngrungy guitar and bass, while the strobes\nflickered wildly behind him. They finished\nwith Come Together (not a cover of The\nBeatles or Primal Scream) which was\nprobably our favourite of the night - and\nas Graham on guitar played the last\nnotes, Alex threw his bass down and the\nrest of the band disappeared into\nbackstage land - and no doubt onto the\nThe Smast Hits Party.\nPinky and Perky\n8\n\n"

    "content": "Lobo Hopefully by now everybody with\nan 1Q higher than Alan Bailey has\nrealised that not all comics are just\nfor kids, and just in case anybody still\nhad any doubts a new title from good ol'\nDC (Detective Comics - the publishers of\nBatman, et al) should convince those non-converts amongst you. The new(ish) title\nis Lobo. Currently only scheduled to be a four-part er it is a loose tie-in with DC s L.E.G.I.O.N.90 titles. Chronicling a small\npart of the rather large life of the\naforementioned Lobo person it's a truly\nexcellent strip. DC have pulled off\nsomething of a genius move, having got\ntheir hands on the hugely talented Simon\nBisley, of Slaine-The Horned God fame.\nBisley is one of the most talented artists\naround, and what's more he's British!\nLobo isn't your average everyday kind of\nhero. He's a pathological psychotic who\nenjoys killing people. And maiming\npeople. And generally not being very\nnice. In fact he's not a hero at all, or to\nuse his own words 'I'm the Hit Man, see,\nAssassin to Royalty, Executioner to the\nLobo's school photo\nStars'. His only redeeming features are his\nrefusal to ever break his word, and his\naffection for a pack of space dolphins that\nhe takes care of. In short, my kind of\nguy. The plot revolves around Lobo\nperforming a job for L.E.G.I.O.N. which\ntakes the form of delivering a prisoner\nalive to their base. Things start to go\nwrong as soon as it turns out the prisoner\nis Miss Tribb, Lobo's4 th grade teacher\nwho somehow survived when Lobo killed\nthe entire population of his home world,\nand then wrote an unofficial biography of\nhim. By the third issue Lobo is being\npursued by a band of space truckers, a SWAT team, a chainsaw dance company,\nthe Legion of Decency's paramilitary\nwing and The Sons of Lobo, a bunch of\ngroupies who worship \"The 'Bo\"! The\nstory is mad, the plot intricate, the\nhumour very black and very satirical, and\nthe art is very, very, very good. Buy it\nnow before Forbidden Planet run out of\nstock. Then write to DC and force them\nto make it a regular series.\nAlien Sex Fiend.\nLove Hurts A very American tale of Paul\nWeaver (Jeff Daniels); the kind of\nguy who married young and had\nkids straight away. Got himself a routine\njob as an insurance salesman, felt he was\nmissing out in life and began to cheat and\nsleep around.\nWhen his wife Nancy (Cynthia Sikes\u2014St\nElsewhere) walks out on him with their\ntwo kids, he's more upset about the\ndivorce settlement than the divorce itself\n(wouldn't you be if you had to give away\nyour $40,000 country farmhouse?).\nHis life of meaningless one-night-stands\n(meaningless??) comes to a sharp turn\nwhen, on the eve of his sister's wedding,\nhe travels to the small town in which he\ngrew up, hoping for a warm reunion with\nhis family. He finds his ex-wife is living\nthere because the farmhouse is under one\nfoot of water. The action then begins\nwith him rekindling the passion with his\nex-wife, extinguishing the passion with his\nex-wife, seducing one of the bridesmaids\nand winning his way back into his\nkleptomaniac daughter's good books.\nThis is a warm bitter-sweet comedy\nalong the lines of Terms of Endearment,\nexcellently produced and directed by Bud Yorkin (Arthur 2, Twice in a Lifetime). It\nshows you don't need gratuitous violence\nor bad language to make for a good\nevening's entertainment. The film also\nhas some very funny moments and\nbrilliant one-liners, but don't be too\nsurprised if it brings a lump to your\nthroat.\nDipak Poria.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\nISEX! VIOLENCE! ROCK' N' ROLL!\nNINJITZU! PIZZA! Everything you\never wanted from a movie\u2014except,\nperhaps, plot, acting and coherent\nsentences. A merry gang of reptiles has\ninhabited the sewers of NY for fifteen\nyears without attracting undue attention\n(possibly because they wear masks so that\nno one knows who they are) until\ninevitably they come into conflict with\nthe forces of evil, hereafter known as\n'The Baddies' (except of course the one\nWho Is Just Confused and Is A Good Guy\nReally). You can guess the rest.\nEn route the Fantastic Four pick up a small retinue; to wit: April O 'Neill (Plucky\nNewsGal Extraordinaire Who Just\nHappens To Have Nice Legs). Casey\nJones (Hero In A Hockey-Mask), and\nSplinter the Rat (Guru And Father-Figure).\nFor the Baddies, we have the Shredder\n(Baddie From the Past) and Misled Youths\n(who are okay really inside), of the\nsinister (titter titter) Foot Clan.\nNaturally, each Turtle has its own\npersonality (thus merchandising of plastic\nfigures is born) although all of them\nappear to consist of getting frenetically\nover excited about cheesy bread and\nexperiencing strange trans-species pangs\nof teenage lust. At this point it is best to\nmention that those who find the term\n'fox' annoying, a) juvenile or b) American\nwill not enjoy this film.\nViolence is rife, although bloodless, on\na scale comparable with the greater\nmoments of the A Team and about as\nrealistically un staged as TJ Hooker with\nthe exception of the aforementioned Mr Jones, who appears to share the same\nphilosophy as the other great Hockey-clad\nfigure of the movies, Jason from Friday\n13th. To conclude: This film is wonderful for\nthe under-15s. The majority of humour is\nTurtle-based and either crass or Not Very Funny. There is one superbly eccentric\nadult gag thrown in (thankfully) and\nmuch well-choreographed fighting. The\nlanguage is quite intolerable, being only\nsemi-comprehensible at the best of times\n(the word' bod a cio us' is one of the few\nwhich assaulted our ears) and to augment\nthis there is gratuitous skateboarding and\nrap music. To finish things off there are\nseveral intolerably cute baby turtles and a titter some ninja rat sequence.\n(To fend off accusations of sexism (re.\nApril's legs) TA FGM would like to add\nthat Casey Jones is what we believe is\nreferred to as a 'hunk' and all the Turtles\nare short, bald and sexy.\nThe Amazing Flying Turtle...no,\nGerbil Machine.\n\n"
