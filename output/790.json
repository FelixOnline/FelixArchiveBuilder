    "content": "|\nNJ ews\nExcuse me,I thought\nthis was the lift\nThe offices of STOIC, the College\ntelevision service, were broken into\nearly on Wednesday morning.\nCharles Robin, Secretary of STOIC,\nwas asleep in the editing room, having\nworked late the previous evening. Mr\nRobin was woken around 4.30am by\nthe sound of a filing cabinet being\nmoved up to the door outside. A small\nwindow about eight feet above the\nfloor, between the corridor and the i main STOIC Office, was broken and\nan intruder climbed through it and I opened the door from the inside to;\nadmit his two accomplices. The first\nintruder then went to a filing cabinet\nwhere STOIC used to keep its petty\ncash. Mr Robin came into the office\nto investigate and pushed past the two\nmen at the door to reach the mains |\nisola tor switch, turning the lights on.\nThe intruders then fled and Mr Robin\nattempted to give chase, but was\nhampered by the broken glass on the\nfloor. The intruders made their way\nout down the main stairs.\nMr Robin dressed and attempted to\nreport the break-in to College\nsecurity. The security officer on duty\n\u2022was on his rounds and the incident\nwas only reported at 4.50am. Mr Robin feels that 'they could at\nleast have taken STOIC's defunct\ncamera', as this is proving impossible\nto sell. Mark Salisbury, Chair of\nSTOIC feels that the thieves must\nhave had some limited knowledge of\nSTOIC as they went straight to where\nthe petty cash used to be kept.\nUnion Deputy Presdient Alan Rose\nwas reluctant to comment as the\nincident may still be investigated by\nthe police. He did, however,\ncomment that as the Union Building\nwas locked by Security at midnight,\nthe methods of entry available to the\nintruders were: via one of three fire\nescapes, by forcing a window, by\nhaving a key to the building or by\nhiding in the building from before\nmidnight until around 4.30am. Mr T Briley, Deputy Chief Security\nOfficer for the,College, agreed that\n'every theft on College property must\nbe looked into and all College security\nis being reviewed at the moment'.\nThe current spate of thefts from\nCollege property includes the theft of\nMicro Computer Society equipment,\nthefts from Hamlet Gardens and from\nSouthwell, Mining and Willis Jackson\nHouses in Evelyn Gardens during the\nChristmas holiday. The total value of\npossessions stolen from residences\nwas more than \u00a31700 including more\nthan \u00a3700 from one individual. The\ncost of repairs to walls, doors and\ndoor frames, which were damaged\nduring the thefts, is expected to be\nbetween \u00a3600 and \u00a3700.\nThe staff of Central Stores have stepped up their campaign against closure\nthis week. They have been distributing leaflets (see above) and collecting\nsignatures for a petition which they intend to present to College\nadministration.\ncontinued from frontpage had been made regarding rent or bar\nincreases and that it would be at least\nthree months before a final decision\nwas made. However, it has been\nmade quite clear to the Union that\ndebts can only be repaid by either a15% increase in bar prices or a5% increase in College rents. 'The root\ncause of our problems is that we have\ngone in for a major capital\nexpenditure programme. We have 25\nyear mortgages on Evelyn Gardens\nand Montpelier Hall and refectories\nto refurbish,' said Mr Aldridge.\nMr Howgate is in a defiant mood.\nHe believes that the refectory\nrefurbishment programme should\nhave been carried out over a longer\nperiod of time and that students had\nbeen misled by College when they\naccepted the new Evelyn Gardens\nproposals last year. 'I 've been Mr\nNice-Guy for too damn long', he said\nyesterday. He told FELIX in no\nuncertain terms that he would not\nhesitate in calling a rent strike if\nstudents were forced to accept even\nmore rent increases to cover College'sine ff ice n cy. College Assistant Secretary\nMichael Arthur was seen quaking in\nhis boots late last night.\nBR plays\nCupid Railcard holders will be able to\nbenefit from a bargain fare after next\nmonth.

    "content": "Reggie was born and brought up in\nthe heart of Northern Ireland which\nhe describes as 'a very poor but\nbeautiful place'. His surname is\nFrench, taken over to Ireland by the\nNormans, where his family have\nremained for generations.\nReggie finished his education in\nDublin, taking a four year course at\nthe equivalent of a polytechnic which\nresulted in a degree in Business\nStudies awarded externally by Trinity\nCollege, Dublin. While at college he\nspent a year as Public Relations\nOfficer and so has a good idea of\nStudent Unions and how they work.\nWith degree in hand, he set off for\n'the bright lights of London' looking\nfor a job, in true Dick Whittington\nstyle, and became 'graduate assistant'\nto a publishing company. Although it\nwas good experience, the company\nwas undergoing a reorganisation at\nthat time, under a new American\nmanager and Reggie admits that it was\nas disaster. The company was cutting\ndown on its workforce and after a year he was given six months notice.\nAgain he quickly found a new job,\nworking in the City for a small\nshipping company. Apparendy it isn't that difficult to find a job in finance!\nAfter two years, he then decided to\nmove on again and applied for a job\nas the finance worker at the recently\nopened London Lesbian & Gay\nCentre (LLGC) responsible, with one\nother person, for looking after the\naccounts for the whole centre. He\nadmits it was good experience of\n'how not to run a business', the centre\nwhich was run as a collective is nuit e large and contains a bar and cafe. One\nproblem with the job was that he had\nto be a 'duty officer' at the Centre two\nnights a week, and this was very tiring\nwhen combined with his full-time\nwork during the day. His job entailed\na great deal of meetings but although\nhe was working with some 'very good\npeople' at an interesting place he left\nafter two and a half years because he\nwanted to move on. He left just as the\nLLGC was facing an uncertain\nfinancial future as the Local\nGovernment Bill was going through\nParliament. This would, if passed,\nprohibit spending on bodies that\n'promote homosexuality', and the\nmain source of funds of the LLGC are\nthe London Local Authorities.\nWhile at the LLGC he had set up\na new computer system and he feels\nthis will come in useful for the job at\nImperial. The job for the post of\nFinancial Officer for IC Union was\nadvertised in the Guardian and he\napplied in November. After a gruelling interview he was awarded\nthe job and began in January. This\nwas the second time that the job had\nbeen advertised; previously the Union\nwas not able to offer enough money\nto attract anybody capable of doing\nthe job and had negotiated a larger\nsalary from the College.\nHe has been stationed in the\nrefurbished Upper Lounge where, not\nonly is it very pleasant and quiet but\nalso has a view of the Albert Hall!\nSituated with his new desk and\npersonal computer, he has started off\non the Snack Bar Accounts, but is\nintending to eventually take over all\nthe financial dealings for the Union\nand put them on the computer. The\nproblem at the moment is that the\nCollege Finance Section audit the\nbooks at the end of the year and,\nbecause of the amount of work they\ndo, the Union don't get the books\nback until half-way through the next\nyear. This causes great problems as\nthe Unions' Clubs and Societies do\nnot know how much money, if any,\nis left over at the end of the previous\nyear until the books are audited, and\nit is this 'carry over' money that makes\nup the contingency funds for the\nfollowing year.\nWith Reggie working preparing the\naccounts, however, the work that the\nauditors have to do will be much\nreduced and the system will run much\nmore smoothly. Also, the Union\ntrading oude ts will benefit much from\nup-to-date trading accounts, with\nweek-to-week knowledge of their\ntrading position.\nThe job of sorting out the Union\naccounts will involve him going\naround various parts of the Union to\nfind out how their finances work and\nlooking for ways to put them on the\ncomputer. He is looking forward to\nthis and actually getting out and\nmeeting 'real students'.\nReggie describes himself as 'shy\nand unassuming'. Asked whether he\nwas efficient, he replied 'Oh God, I suppose I had better say yes!'. He\ndescribes accountants as 'the most\nboring people in the world' but insists\nthat 'Financial Officers' are different\nand are actually 'dynamic'. He hopes\nto join in with Union activities and has\na special interest in, believe it or not,\nballroom dancing. He doesn't intend\nto sit closet ted in his office for the\nnext two years.\nAlthough he claims to talk too\nmuch, when he found himself\nsurrounded in the FELIX office, he\nbecame curiously quiet. He was\nparticularly quiet on the subject of this\nyear's sab attica l s,T haven't been here\nlong enough to know yet' he claims,\nbut added 'I'm being a politician'.\nHe comes across as very warm,\nfriendly and interesting, not your\ntypical accountant, 'I'm trying to\nbreak the mould' he claims, 'being an\naccountant is a way to get on'. He\nwould like to move away from\nfinance eventually, perhaps into\nManagement or something similar.\nAs to the future, he intends to stay\nwith IC Union long enough to set up\nthe new financial system and then see\nwhat further challenges he can take\non here. He is under no illusions\nabout what he has taken on, although\nhe gives the impression that he is\nmore than equal to them. Despite only\nbeing here for two weeks he has made\na lot of friends and has quickly settled\nin.\nWe wish him luck.\nThe Union's Biggest\nGamble At the start of the 1985/86 session IC\nUnion staged what was probably the\nmost successful student boycott to\ntake place in London this decade. As\na result of this outstanding effort IC\nStudents' Union took control of the\nUnion Bar.\nThis year the Bar Birthday is being\ncelebrated on January 29, from 8pm, when the whole Union building is\nbeing taken over for a carnival type\nevent to be called the Bar Birthday\nBall. Outside of including three\nbands: Jim Jiminee, Stagefright and\nChillon, who have all held highly\nsuccessful performances at IC\nrecently, the event sports a2 am bar\nextension, beer from 60pa pint from\n'8pm to 10pm, a disco and films until\n3am,a string quartet in the Union\nBar, jazz piano and a casino.\nThe casino is without a doubt the\nlargest revelation to hit a Union event\nin years. A ticket to the Ball, costing\nonly \u00a33.50 in advance and \u00a34 on the\ndoor, entitles you to all the above\nevents and a programme for the\ncasino, which provides you with not\nonly the gaming rules but also a set\nnumber of chips which you can\ngamble with at no cost to yourself at\na choice of three tables: Roulette,\nCraps and Blackjack. At the end of\nthe day when all the chips have been\ncollected in, the top winner will win\none of the \u00a31,400 worth of prizes\ngenerously donated by Capital\nLeisure, owners of Third Street\nNightclub and organisers of the\ncasino. The prizes include the hire of\nThird Street Nightclub one weekday\nnight, at no cost, for your own private\nfunction for up to 200 people; the\nAmbassador Suite at Third Street for\na night, for 80 people, for free; a gallon bottle of red wine; half a case\nof house wine and much more\nalcohol.\nThis is your chance to enjoy the\nbest night out of the year and try your\nluck at the tables for next to nothing\nwhilst the Union sub sid is es your\nevening.\nTickets are on sale from the Union\nOffice, Union Snack Bar and\ndepartmental reps from next Monday\nonwards.\n'Shy and unassuming9 Tm trying to break the\nmould.\n'accountants are the most\nboring people in the world...'\nFELIX Friday January 22nd198811 "

    "content": "Society Rage BALLOON CLUB\nAre you wondering what this is a picture of? If so then you now know\nwhat the bottom of our hot-air balloon\nlooks like!\nIn 1783 man took to the air in the\nfirst ever 'aircraft'\u2014a hot air balloon\npowered by a fire made of burning\nstraw and twigs! But a month later the\nfirst (hydrogen) gas balloon took off.\nIn those days it was a much more\npractical device than the clumsy and\nrather dangerous hot-air balloon (its\ndesign has changed little since). Hotair ballooning had died a quick death\nand it was not until almost 200 years\nlater that new materials and modern\ntechnology were used to help generate\nand contain hot air. A hot-air balloon\ncan now be operated at about one per\ncent of the cost of that of a gas balloon\nand hot-air ballooning has now\nbecome one of the fastest growing air\nsports.\nOne's first balloon flight is a mixture of fear, appreciation of\nbeauty and a wonder that the thing\nworks at all. To float 'out of this\nworld', away into the clouds and 'ride\nthe winds' is an experience hard to\nexplain.\nAs a club we fly, weather\npermitting, most weekends and\nthroughout the summer. Our local\nlaunch site is down in Newbury (near\nReading) but we also participate in\nmany balloon meets around the\ncountry where there can often be seen\nspecial shaped balloons (have you\never seen a flying chateau, Mickey\nMouse, Donald Duck, light bulb, ice\ncream cone...to name but a few!).\nEverybody is welcome to our\nregular Thursday lunchtime meetings\nat 1pm in Southside Upper Lounge\n(above bar)\u2014just ask around for the\nballoon club! It really is a beautiful\nsport and surprisingly inexpensive, so\nplease come and say hello.\nJan Vonka, Chairman.\nPHOTOCOPIER The Imperial College Union Print Unit is pleased to an nou ce the arrival of its new photocopier. We can now produce posters in a combination of red, blue and black on five colours of paper with just a one hour turnaround. Make your publicity seen. See Judith in the FELIX Office for more details. AMNESTY INT.\nThe Syrian Campaign is still\nContinuing. Please take ten minutes of\nyour time to write a letter to: Mahmud\nal-Zu'bi, Prime Minister, Office of\nthe Prime Minister, 'Abd al-Rahman\nShahbandar Street, Damascus, Syrian\nArab Republic, concerning this\nwoman:\nHind Qahwaji, a31 year old\nagricultural engineer from Tal al-Nin,\nwas first arrested for her membership\nof the Party for Communist Action\n(PCA) in October 1982. She was\nreleased on March 3 1983 and\nre arrested on March 21 1984. Initially\ndetained in the Military Interrogation\nBranch in Damascus, she was tortured\nsoon after arrest and reportedly\nrequired an operation on her uterus\nas a result. She is detained without\ncharge or trial in Qatana Women's Prison, south west Damascus. This is\na civil prison but it is used to detain\nboth political and non-political\nprisoners. Hygiene and medical\nservices in the prison are reported to\nbe extremely poor. In mid-June 1985\nAmnesty International appealed\nurgently on behalf of Hind Qahwaji,\nwho suffer es from asthma, and six\nother detained PCA members,\nfollowing reports that they were in\npoor health and that medical care and\nfamily visits were being denied them.\nNo response was received from the\nSyrian authorities. Hind Qahwaji is\nmarried, and was adopted by AI as\na prisoner of conscience in June 1985.\nPlease send courteous letters\nappealing for her immediate and\nunconditional release. Please also\nrefer to FELIX issues dated\nNovember 13 1987 and December 4\n1987 for more details. If you would\nlike to know more about Syria and/or\nmore about Amnesty, feel free to\ncontact Guy Sims or Monique Yeo\n(both Maths 2).\nWatch this space for the upcoming\nRefugee Campaign!\nSCOUT & GUIDE\nLast term was a successful one for\nS&G, with plenty of events taking\nplace. There were four weekend\ntrips\u2014to the Peak District, North\nYorkshire and the Brecon Beaconsfor\nwalking and climbing and a weekend\n'off' barging on the Grand Union\nCanal.\nIn the Peaks, various groups of\nwalkers went on 'bog-trots' around\nKinder Count, while the climbers\nan joyed a superb day at Froggat\nEdge. The party included several\nfresher s who learnt basic climbing\ntechniques. Yorkshire saw a partly\nsuccessful attempt at the \"Three\nPeaks' and some rather damp\nlimestone climbing in Giggleswick\nScar. The Brecon Beacons was an\narea the Club had not visited for some\ntime but proved to be a popular\nvenue. The three main peaks of the\nBrecdns were reached and groups\nalso walked the stretch of the Off a's Dyke path over the Black Mountains.\nThe barging weekend was\nsomething else entirely. A constant\nbattle was waged between the crews\nof the two barges\u2014there was plenty\nof ammunition for use in the shape of\nwater pistols and buckets. Several\ngood bridge-hops were also carried\nout.\nAll the weekends were well attended\nand thoroughly enjoyed by all\nconcerned. Several social events took\nplace during the term, including the\nannual pub crawl and restaurant trip.\nOver the New Year, we spent a week in Killion, Central Scotland, for\nsome winter mountaineering. The lack\nof snow put paid to the 'winter' bit,\nbut despite the foul weather, a total\nof nineteen different Munros\n(mountains over 3,000ft) were\nclimbed by various people.\nThis term, the Club will be going\nto Snowdonia and the Lake District\n(twice each) for some winter walking\nand scrambling and hopefully also\nsome ice-climbing. We still have room\nfor some new members, if you are\ninterested contact Justin Petty (Min\nTech 4) or see us in Southside Upper\nLounge any day except Thursday at\n12.30pm. On Thursdays we have\nj meetings (slide show and talk) at\n! 12.30pm in Mines B303.\nFELIX Friday January 22nd198817 "

    "content": "Hiccups after\nindulgence\nNew College III\u20141\nIC II\u20143\nAfter the Christmas festivities, IC\ntook a while to get back into their\nstride. Lethargic at the back, slow in\nthe midfield, and asleep up front.\nHowever, It was IC who dominated\nthe first half, on a heavily sanded\npitch, but couldn't turn chances into\ngoals, only managing to hit the\nwoodwork twice, and have the ball\ncleared off the line. At half-time the\nscore remained at 0-0. IC started the\nsecond half as slow as the first. New\nCollege then took the lead as IC's defence stood still. This woke IC up,\nand Pip Peel, back from in ury, began\nto link up with Rob Kelly, to\ndominate the midfield. Chris Burton\nand Mick Plummer made surging\nruns down the wings, and Guy Phiri\nand Alan Glass began to work as they\ndid last term. Russ Dark and Stuart\nMiller dominated the the heart of the\ndefence, and Ian Charlton and Bas\nBasma, making their debuts for the\n2nds, contributed on midfield. Soon\nthe equalise r came, with an own goal.\nIC surged forward again, hitting the\nbar several times, before Alan Glass\nforced the ball home in a goal line\nscramble. After hitting the bar several\nmore times, Alan glass ran through\nFOOTBALL\nover-again, and his shot was deflected in\nby an unfortunate defender. A solid\nsecond half performance, indicated\nthat IC 2nds are purring again,\nhungry for the divisional\nchampionship.\nIC 6th7 Charing Cross & Westminster\u20141\nAn emphatic 7-1 victory finally\nconfirmed the promise this largely\nunheard of team has shown\nthroughout the season. Coming at the\nstart of this year's campaign it has\nimmediately resurrected their\npromotion hopes.\nThe goals began within 5 minutes\nwhen a cross from Richard Miles was\ncleanly volleyed home by the team's Scottish ace Cameron Gilmour. The\ngoals continued throughout the match\nwith two goals for Aiden Chandler\nand Richard Miles and a goal a piece\nfor Al Bamford and Andy Draine.\nThe one slight hiccup occurred early\nin the second half but should really\nbe ignored in this fine all round\nperformance which considerably\nbrightened' this damp and foggy\nafternoon for all in attendance.\nHOCKEY\nBurton makes the hat-trick\nIC 3rds5 Chalfont St Peter 1\nWithin seconds the first goal was\nproduced by the 3rds, a spectacular\ngoal from Vish Ashiabor slamming\nthe ball hard against the backboard.\nA second goal was made by some\npassing around in the D until Steve\nBurton managed to get the ball in\nfollowed by another later in the first\nhalf to make the score at half-time 3-0\nAlmost straight after the whistle for\nthe second half Hassann Majid hit the\nball into the net, 4-0. Shortly\nafterwards the opposition managed to\nget their first goal, the keeper came\nout to attack the player but he was just\nable to sneek the ball in. The final last\nminutes saw a final goal by Steve\nBurton\u2014A hattrick for him and a jug\nfor us.\nIC1 Charing Cross\u20141\nThis was not a very memorable\nmatch. Players were lethargic and\nunfit after the Christmas break.\nCharing Cross began well and quickly\nscored one goal. For the rest of the\nfirst half IC had most of the\npossession but failed to take the\nchances this created to score. IC came\nfrom behind to score a scrappy goal\naccredited to Seward. Bettendge\nplayed well at inside forward. The\nsecond half saw Charing Cross\nlooking much more likely to score.\nHowever good defence from Faldon,\nPownall and Tucker prevented this.\nORIENTEERING\nLarge amounts\nThere was a good turn out for the first\nevent of the term last Sunday, to\nBasildon Park, Streetley* This was a friendly colour-coded event and\ndespite impaired fitness due to large\n:amounts of over-indulgence over the\n| Christmas period, all members of the\nClub were brave enough to attempt\na hard 'blue' course. All completed\nthe course with good times, well-up\non the results lists. This shows the\nimprovement made over the last\ncouple of years in the overall standard\nof orienteering in the Club.\nThis week's event is a colour-coded\nevent on Esher Common, see\nnoticeboard for details, all welcome.\nCRICKET\nThe time has come once more for you\nto bleach the grass stains out of your\nwhites, oil the trusty willow and step\nup to the crease. Yes it's the preseason nets at Lord's every Tuesday\nfrom 8-9pm. All you have to do is\nsign up on the Cricket notice board\noutside the Union Bar and meet in the\nlobby of Mech Eng at 7pm, equipped\nCreasing up\nwith whites, training shoes, and the\ntalent of Ian Botham. As always our\nfirst eleven will be packed with\ninternational stars, but there is plenty\nof room in the other teams for the rest\nof us mortals. So all players are\nwelcome for a' merv ello us' day's cricket.\nTony Greenfield.\nFELIX Friday January 22nd198815 "

The thunderbolt is seen by\ncommentators as a medieval\nimpression of a bullet. JFK was\nindeed shot in broad daylight, by Lee\nHarvey Oswold, from the top of a building in Dallas, 1963. Robert was\nshot nearly five years later, at night,\nwhile celebrating a presidential\nprimary election victory. But all these\nlinks between various of his 942\nquatrains have been made by those\nkeen to find some meaning to\nNostradamus words.\nHitler apparently saw himself in\nNostradamus' predictions, he and Dr\nGoebbels using them for propaganda.\nIn the quatrains, reference to\n'Hister'\u2014before the 1930s this was\ntaken as being the Danube river, as\nthis is 'Ister' in Latin, but 'Hitler'\ndoes give the quatrains more\nrelevance (well relatively, at least).\nNostradamus talks in context of,\n- '...the child of Germany observes\nno law'\nand,\n'In the deepest part of western\nEurope a child will be born of poor\nfamily who by his speech will entice\nmany peoples.'\nbut, perhaps more specifically,\n'Near the Rhine from the Norican\nmountains will be born a great man\nof the peoples come too late. He will\ndefend Poland and Hungary and they\nwill never know what became of\nhim.'\nHitler was indeed, born of humble\nbeginnings in Norican, Austria, and\nwas also a great orator. He invaded\nPoland and Hungary to save' them\nfrom the Allies\u2014defensive? And, of\ncourse, the ultimate final teaser\u2014did\nhe really die in the bunker in Berlin?\nAdmittedly some of this is intriguing,\nbut it does seem that if you look hard\nenough you will find something of\nrelevance, however tenuous.\nNostradamus' style lends itself well\nto free-interpretation, especially if\nadjusted in translation.\nBut enough of the distant past, what\nis there of a more topical nature? Well\nhow about this,\n'The Libyan Prince will be\npowerful in the West, the French will\nbecome so en amour ed of Arabia.'\nThe Libyan Prince? Well, quite\nobviously Colonel Gadaffi; at least\nhe'd like to think he was powerful in\nthe West. But what about the French\naffection for Arabs? Could it be the\nrelease of the Iranian envoy, believed\nto be involved with the Paris\nbombings, in exchange for French\nhostages in the Lebanon?\nWait, this one's even better,\n'The Arab Prince, Mars, the Sun,\nVenus and Leo, the rule of the Church\nwill succumb to the sea, towards\nPersia...\nThe conjunction of Mars, the Sun\nand Venus occured on August 21,\n1987\u2014the height of the Gulf War and\nthe navies of Christendom even get\na mention and a reference to Leo/lion\ndoes of course refer to the Royal\nNavy escorting re-flagged\ntankers\u2014obviously!\nNow to the future, no surprises\nhere, it is a prediction of gloom, but\nwith a specific date. I hope you're\nready for this;\n'In the year 1999, and seven\nmonths from the sky will come the\ngreat King of Terror. He will bring\nback to life the great king of the\nmongols. Before and after war reigns\nhappily.\nOn a lighter note, there is even a previously unattributed quatrain\nmaking clear reference to Imperial,\n'Near to the port with no sea, The\nfields of friendly battle shall yield\nthree-fold riches from the very earth.\nAni shall be contented.'\nA port with no sea\u2014an airport! But\na friendly battle is a clear\ncontradiction, unless it could be sport\n(in principle at least). So a sports field\nnear an airport; Harlington is near\nHeathrow! Riches from the ground-it must be the Harlington gravel\u2014\u00a33\nmillion. But who or what is 'Ani'\u2014a difficult one for any student of\nNostradamus, but could it be a devious anagram of Ian\u2014a happy\nUnion president?!! This beats solving\n3-2-1 clues!\nBut, what's this? Century VI,\nQuatrain 100;\n'Incantation of the Law Against\nInept Critics...'\nLinda Simmons, College We\nwith advice to all overseas\nLeave to remain Renewing your leave to\nremain in the UK\nIt is only possible to renew your leave\nto remain through the College in\nSeptember and October each year.\nAny notices still up in College\nadvertising this service are out of date\nand shou d be taken down. I'm sorry\nif they have misled any students who\nhave read them.\nRemember. The golden rule when\nattempting to get leave to remain\nextended is to apply before the expiry\ndate. Even when the College scheme\nis in operation, we are unable to\naccept applications from students\nwhose leave to remain has already\nexpired. However, I will always try\nto help students in this situation,\nalthough the College has no special\nresources to guarantee that a late\napplication will be successful. As\nsoon as you overstay your leave to\nremain, even if it is by only one day,\nyou are in breach of the Immigration\nRules (ie you are an Overstayer) and\nthus lose your right to appeal against\nany refusal to renew your right to\nremain in the UK.\nHome Office Backlog\nDue to an overwhelming number of\napplications for registration for\ncitizenship, the Home Office case\nwork division now has a huge backlog\nof work. This means that written\napplications to the Home Office are\ntaking about six weeks before the\nenvelope is opened and up to three\nmonths before the enquiry is\nanswered.\nSimilarly, people applying in\nperson at Croydon are facing queues\nof up to 8 or 10 hours. As there are\nno eating facilities in the Public\nEnquiry Office, I should take some\nsandwiches and coffee!\nGreek Students\nFrom 1st January 1988, Greece\nbecame a full member of the EEC.\nThis means that like other EEC\nStudents, Greek students are now able\nto work part-time and study part-time\nif they wish. It also appears that they\nshould be able to claim Housing\nBenefit, although the situation\nregarding EEC students and Housing\nBenefit is unclear at the moment and\nanyone in doubt should check with me\nbefore claiming.\nAny Greek student who has\nrestrictions stamped in their passports\nwho would like them removed,\nshould write (recorded delivery) to\nthe Home Office requesting that their\nleave be changed to that of an EEC\nnational. But wait until the end of\nJanuary before applying, in order to\nlet the backlog of work described\nabove die down.\nExtended Leave to Remain\nIt is stated Home Office policy to give\ngenuine overseas students three years\nleave to remain if they apply at the\nbeginning of a three year course.\nHowever, it does appear that this\nis not happening in practice.\nUKCOSA (The United Kingdom\nCouncil for Overseas Students\nAffairs) recommends that all overseas\nstudents who have only one year's leave to remain, but whose course is\nlonger and wish to extend their\npermission, should write (recorded\ndelivery) to the Home Office\nrequesting an extension of their\npresent leave to cover the duration of\nthe course. You should, of course,\nsubmit all the usual evidence.\nIn order to see if the Home Office\nare carrying out their officially stated\npolicy, I would be most grateful if\nthose students who do apply would let\nme know how they get on especially\n1\nif they are refused, as UKCOSA have\nstated that they will do everything\nthey can to help students in this\nsituation.\nIf you need help' or information on\nany of the above topics or almost\nanything else, you can find me on the\n1st Floor, 15 Princes Gardens,\nMonday to Friday, 10am2.30 pm, ext 3604.\nLinda Simmons, Welfare Advisor.\nFELIX Friday January 22nd19889 "

Will Evelyn Gardens ever be rid of this\nterror?\nApparently Mark Lee and the 'Magnificent Seven' (the\nhousing tribunal), think so. 'MI7' recently attempted to\nprosecute Ben Hodgson and Chris Stapleton for a string\nof raids. These raids were in fact conducted mainly by\nthe VP and myself alone, including that terrible night of\nthe hanging basket!\nThe executive of the (most exclusive) Gauntlet Club have\npreviously considered both Ben and Chris for member hip, but although they show potential, an invitation to join was\nnever extended.\nPerhaps the aim of the Club should be clarified. We try\nto practice a nov.el non destructive fot m of mascot ry, borrowing things and giving them back mainly intact a few days later, having left a gauntlet in place of the\nremoved object.\nUp to now our dealings have been restrained'to Evelyn,\nbut beware! Even grander plans regarding Keogh Hall are\ncurrently in the 'operation planning' stage.\nI think it's sad some people find it so difficult to have\nfun. Don't forget\u2014everyone knows where Holbein House\nis, and they can always come and have a go at us one night.\nYou could even say we are 'laying down the gauntlet' in\nan official challenge.\nHowever, despite the joviality I shall end on a more\nserious note. The threat of eviction of fellow students from\nCollege residences must surely be a subject concerning\nus all. Indeed it would appeal innocence is no protection\nagainst the wrath of MI7.\nHope everyone (including Mr Lee) had a great Xmas,\nand long live FELIX's lack of censorship.\nYours sincerely,\ncommitted to their music.\n2. The name Baby Delta left long before I did and at\nmy urgent and frantic prompting.\n3. The name Baby Delta was not associated with me\npersonally, the whole band chose it and must share the\nblame for its awfulness and absurdity.\nAlso, out of the kindness of my heart, I played a gig\nwith the band at the Holland Club, although (according\nto Mr Hartley) I had been unceremoniously kicked out\nweeks before. I also allowed them to use my own personal\ndrum kit( which is mine) in order to audition my\nreplacement.

    "content": "pip**\ngenerous. Actual predictions of the\nratios of various strategies can be\nmade given particular circumstances.\nOne puzzle for the theory is why\nbrood-parasitism (that is, trying to get\nsomeone else to bring up your\nchildren) is not common within single\nspecies. Cuckoos do it to other\nspecies, but it wasn't thought to\nhappen much between members of the\nsame species.\nRecent observations on some bird\ncolonies have shown the fault is with\nthe observations not the theory: to see\nbrood parasitism you need to mark\neggs (otherwise they all look the\nsame) and trace them between nests.\nIn some colonies of cliff swallows, up\nto 6% of the eggs were not laid by\nthe owner of the nest they were in.\nThis is a literal case of not putting all\nyour eggs in one basket. The survival\nrate of transferred eggs is higher than\nfor unmoved ones, presumably\nbecause the swallows can select the\nbest neighbours to move their children\nto.\nThe amount of exploitation going\non is about what would be predicted\nas stable by the selfish gene theory.\nSo cuckoos are not the only exploiters\nin the world of birds.\nSelfish genes and people\nSo what?\nPeople are worried about being\nreduced to robots run by their genes.\nThe theory is threatening because it\nappears to explain all our behaviour\nin terms of genetic programming, and\nthis contradicts our notions of free\nwill.\nHowever, it's worth noting that\nmost human behaviour is learned\nbehaviour, not programmed. Also,\nwe are the first species on the planet\nintelligent enough to look at the\nprocess of evolution and see how it\nworks: we should be able to transcend\nany genetic programming we may\nhave. So don't believe anyone who\nfatalistic ally believes we are\ncompletely run by our DNA. People\nare different from animals: selfish\ngenes can only work if we are not\naware of them.\nIt is important for us to realise this.\nMorality, altruism, and being nice to\npeople other than your relatives, is\nsomething we have to teach. The\nfuture of the human race may require\nthe sort of huge acts of altruism that\nonly sentient moral beings are capable\nof. We now have sufficient power to\ndestroy ourselves if we leave our\ndecisions to our blind instincts.\nThis is a very superficial description\nof the whole subject. For those who\nwant to learn more the key book is\n'The Selfish Gene', Richard Duwkins,\nOxford University Press, 1976.\nI was quite amazed by the response\nto my first column last week. The\namount of people in my own\ndepartment who rushed up and told\nme what a pil lock I was was\nunbelievable.\nAs you may have guessed from the\ntone of this introduction, not a soul\nmentioned my new journey into the\nworld of journalistic garbage. I could\nhave understood it if it was just a matter of casual departmental\nacquaintances but I have managed to\nattend several meetings and two\nsociety dinners since last Friday and\nnot even close friends cared to bring\nit up in conversation. It would have\nmade the dinners much more\ninteresting than having to listen to the\nbellicose c hitter chatter of ancient\nclub members recalling their own\nstudent days and why the club wasn't the same anymore.\nI go to such dinners to meet old\nfriends who have gone in their own,\nvery different directions after leaving\nImperial. They provide the only\nopportunity to catch up on the gossip,\nplan future meetings and dinner\nparties, and lightly flirt with the new\nwives of old enemies.\nIt was this weekend that I found\nmyself at another College dinner.\nEverytime I go to one, I vow never\nto let myself do it again. It's a bit like\ngetting ratted. I always end up doing\nit occasionally, after the memory has\nbeen numbed from a suitably long\ninterval. It's always an unpleasant\nexperience. I hate the way they\nbrazenly serve up packet soup for\nstarters. My idea of an ideal dinner\nis not a mouthful of monosodium\nglutamate. Why can't they provide\nsoup from a tin, at least? I keep\nfinding lumps of dehydrated chicken\nfloating idly around my bowl which\ngive me no end of pleasure trying to\nre hydrate and edi b lise. In my time at Imperial I must have\ntried all the set meals that the\nRefectories have concocted. The roast\nduck with more fat than meat; the\nrubber sweet corn; the soggy broccoli;\nand the Boeuf en Croute which was\nall c route and no boeuf.\nI can just about take the awfulness\nof the food\u2014I'm only a student after\nall\u2014but the service is unbelievable.\nOne dinner I attended not so long ago\nwas outrageously expensive, the food\nwas poor and it took the two geriatrics\nwho were serving us nearly fifteen\nminutes to serve up the main course.\nThey put the meat out first which was\nstone-cold by the time the potatoes\nfinally made their appearance.\nAnd why should I be spoken to so\nrudely when I ask for a knife that is\nclean and not s mattered with\nyesterday's food? The waitresses look\ndaggers at you if you even suggest\nthat your neighbour has one more\nj slice of meat than you have received.\nThey tip gravy down your best suit\nand mumble apologies under their\nbreaths. They call you 'de a rie' not\n'sir': 'Mind out, de a rie!' they screech\nif you dare to talk to your neighbour\nwhile they are trying to serve you.\nWhat ever happened to 'Excuse me,\nplease'?\nThe sweet is usually a Sainsbury's lemon tart or, if you're really lucky,\na partially thawed piece of Black\nForest Gateau with the option of\ncream!\nThe best dinner I ever went to at\nCollege was a simple buffet-type\nmeal. There were no waitresses to\ndeal with, no lack of food on my plate\nand a pleasant evening was had by all.\nEven the veggies in the party had no\ncomplaints about the evening.\nI will, no doubt, find myself at\nanother College dinner in the future.\nI will not be there for the food, nor\nthe service. I will be there because I want to meet old friends and because\nthe person organising the dinner\ndidn't want the bother of going\n'outside' for the meal. I can only hope\nthat things may have improved by this\ntime.

They buy and buy until they have\nall the best players, how can the other\nteams fight that. I admit that John\nBarnes, Peter Beardsley et al are\nproving to be brilliant, but if Charlton\ncan beat them I will be over-joyed.\nI will stick my neck out and say that\nthey can do it. A victory for the\nminnows over money.\nAlso tomorrow are Imperial\nCollege's Purple People Eaters,\nDoors influenced 60s and 70s psychedelia.

There were\nhundreds of them, leather ed and long\nhaired young ladies and gentlemen,\npiled six deep in the bars, lying\nbombed out of their heads on god-knows-what on the stairs and\nwandering aimlessly around outside\nafter the gig was pronounced 'sold\nout'. Greboes, goths, headbangers,\nhip-hop fans, psycho billies and\nhippies waiting for the band who are\nwhat the Beastie Boys will never be.\nChelsea vs Portsmouth\nStamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)\nA match between two teams in the\nbottom half of Division One, two\nteams with no real form, does not\nseem to offer much for a neutral\nspectator. Chelsea are unbeaten at\nhome but are eleven games without\na league win. Portsmouth have\nbrought into the division a mixture of\ndisgraceful behaviour both on the\nfield and off, a dictator chairman and\na moaning manager in Alan Ball.\nNew captain Noel Blake has put a little more iron into Pompey though,\nand they are playing a little better.\nStamford Bridge is an awful ground\nfor a terrace spectator, you are miles\nfrom the pitch, and with teams that\npossess such unruly 'fans', I would\nkeep away from this one. A00 draw\nis the sort of result to expect, though\nPompey could snatch it with a little\nluck.\nLeyton Orient vs Stockport\nBrisbane Rd (Leyton tube)\nOrient only drew last week thanks to\na90 th minute goal, a disappointing\nresult for manager Frank Clark who\nhas moulded a good side into a promotion winning outfit, fit to take\non Forest next week. Stockport have\nveteran Asa Hartford and managed a draw against table-topping Wolves\nlast week. I expect Orient to win\ncomfortably.\nFOOTBALL\nby Adrian Grainger\nGame of the day:\nCharlton vs Liverpool\nPop Will Eat Itself arrive on cue,\nopening with a low deep drum beat\nand grinding guitars, all done on\nbacking-box. For the first song or two\nit appears that this band go for power j at the expense of all imagination and\ntalent, but you know it's all a piss-take, a chance to shout and stomp and\ngo totally mindless. The songs are so\noffensive that they become\ninoffensive. Still, half an hour was\nlong enough to get the point; every\nsubsequent minute was wasted. The\nattitude of the night was summed up\nby the slogan on the t shirt of one of\nthe band: 'The Poppies are crap'. A joke, a bit of a laugh but not to be\nrisked too often.\nArsenal vs Manchester Utd\nHighbury (Arsenal tube)\nThis is the live game on TV on\nSunday and although it features two\nof the top five, a series of 0-0 draws\nin the past over s had dow s the game. -2-0 defeats for both teams last week\nvirtually ended their championship\nas pe rations. Arsenal can be exciting:\nat times and Alan Smith, David\nRocastle and Niall Quinn produce\nflair up front. United are having a good season with McClair providing\na punch in the attack that has been\nmissing before. Bryan Robson has led\nhis team well this year but I think that\nthe Gunners will take the 3 points.\nThis will be a good game for the\npartizans but the neutral would be\nbetter staying at home this time.\nFulham vs Chester\nCraven Cottage (Putney Bridge tube)\nBoth of these middle of the table\nteams lost their third division games\nlast week by 2-1 and there aren't any\npointers to show that this will be a game to see.

Still following the game plan,\nLimp and clumsy\nafter ten minutes of good play, IC\ncame off the throttle and let UCL back\nin. Limp and clumsy tackling caused\na spate of defending short corners\nwhich rewarded UCL with a farcical\ngoal.

    "content": "UNDER THE\nMICROSCOPE by Steve Black\nBirds are bastards too! Recent evidence (Nature 331 pl9 and\np66) has shown that some birds are\nrather less 'moral' than we used to\nthink. They transfer their own eggs\ninto the nests of other members of the\nsame species, to save them the effort\nof having to look after such a large\nbrood themselves. (Cuckoos do the\nsame sort of thing but at least have\nthe courtesy to parasitize other\nspecies.) To understand why this is\nan interesting observation we have to\nnia kea rather long detour into a highly controversial area of\nevolutionary theory. But first a look\nat why it is controversial.\nAnimals and morality\nAn opponent of mine at a debating\ncompetition, attacking sentimental\nnotions of animal rights, started his\nspeech thus ' All animals are\nbastards'. This attracted everyone's attention, but before he was accused\nof being unnecessarily crude, he\ncontinued: 'Because none of their\nparents are married'.\nApart from being a good way to\nwin a debate, the statement contains\nprofound truths about animal and\nhuman nature. We should not judge\nanimals when they behave in an\nimmoral way, because they are\nincapable of moral reasoning.\nEqually, we should not read too much\ninto examples of supposedly good\nbehaviour in them, because their\nbehaviour is unlikely to be controlled\nby the sort of conscious motivations\nthat make morality possible.\nHowever, many people are\nunrepentant ly sentimental when it\ncomes to ascribing human motives to\nanimal behaviour. Altruistic\nbehaviour in animals is a particularly\ndangerous area. There are many\nexamples of animals behaving in ways\nwhich appear to be detrimental to\nthemselves but to the benefit of other\nmembers of the same species. For\nexample, birds will often pretend to\nbe injured to distract predators away\nfrom their chick-containing nests.\nMany people (some of them even\nprofessional biologists) ascribe\nhuman-like motives to such altruistic\ndisplays. Supposedly, the birds are\ntaking a considerable personal risk for\nthe good of others (or the species as\na whole). Therefore, they are\nbehaving in a way that would merit\na human bravery medal.\nStrangely, many people get very\nuneasy when biologists debunk such\nanthropomorphic illusions. Perhaps it\nis because altruism is such an\nimportant aspect of human behaviour,\nand people are worried that we can\n'explain it away'. People are always\nvery anxious not to be regarded as\nmere animals. Books such as The\nSelfish Gene have caused considerable\nunease by attempting to explain all\naltruistic behaviour in terms of\ngenetically programmed self interest.\nIt is worth looking at the selfish-gene hypothesis in some detail, as it\ngives a good illustration of modern\nevolutionary thinking.\nSelfish genes and behaviour\nThe basic idea of the theory is that\nnatural selection works more on the\nlevel of individual genes than on the\nlevel of species or organisms. This\nimplies that the game of evolution is\nmuch more subtle than most people\ntend to think. Natural selection ceases\nto be about individual animals\nstruggling to survive, but becomes\nabout bits of DNA struggling to\nperpetuate themselves. This is often\nseen as disturbing, because it seems\nto degrade individuals into robots\nblindly programmed to reproduce\ntheir genes. This is apparently more\ndifficult to cope with than the idea of\nindividuals struggling to stay alive.\nThe theory makes a lot of sense\nwhen stripped of anthropomorphic\nlanguage. Genes do not consciously\nmanipulate animals in order to\nreproduce, but genes which code for\nsuccessful st rage gies will spread in a population.\nThe theory has no trouble\nexplaining apparently altruistic\nbehaviour. It can be beneficial to a gene for a parent to sacrifice itself for\nthe sake of its children, because the\nchildren contain copies of the same\nDNA. So behaviour which appears to\nbe altruistic is actually caused by the\nselfishness of some bit of DNA.\nPresumably this is why so many\npeople get hot under the collar at the\nselfish-gene theory: it appears to\ndu bunk the possibility of truly selfless\nbehaviour. I will come back to this\nlater. But first it pays to look at the\nactual theory stripped of all its\nhumanized language. All it says about\naltruism is this: if a gene exists that\ncauses parents to sacrifice themselves,\nin some circumstances, for the sake\nof their young, then such a gene will\nspread because more copies of it will\nbe passed on. This applies, of course,\nonly if the sacrifice is worthwhile, but\nthe necessary conditions can be\nexpressed mathematically enabling us\nto see what sorts of strategy are\nworthwhile.\nWhen the numbers are worked out,\nthe selfish gene theory can explain a lot of animal behaviour. Certain\nstrategies are not stable: for example,\nblind altruism. This will survive as\nlong as everybody else in a population\ncontains blind altruistic genes, but as\nsoon as an exploiting gene arrives it\nwill rapidly multiply. It saves effort\nby being a bastard, while everybody\nelse is wasting their time and effort\nbeing nice. However, blind\nexploitation is rarely a stable strategy\neither (not caring at all for your\nchildren is no way to pass on your\ngenes). Intermediate strategies or\nmixtures of strategies are the things\nwhich work best. Exploiting\nstrategies can be stable if they are not\ntoo common in a population, just as\naltu is m works well if it is not too\n4 Friday January 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

According\nto figures from the Students Residence Committee and College\nRegistry, there will again be a shortfall of about one hundred student\nplaces, says Union President Ian Howgate.\nMr Howgate has criticised College\nadministration for its short-sighted\npolicy of increasing student numbers\nto reduce the College deficit.\nHe has based his claims on estimates\nof next year's student intake made by\nCollege Registrar Peter Mee. Mr Mee\nhas indicated that undergraduate\nnumbers must increase by 5% and\npostgraduate numbers by 10% to\nreach targets. He also says that these\nestimates are 'conservative' because\nthe Governors have set a target of an\nextra 100 overseas students, over and\nabove the increase to pay off the\nCollege's projected \u00a32m deficit. Mr\nHowgate says that this means a total\nincrease of more than 68 fresher s and\n35 overseas postgraduates needing\nCollege accommodation this October.\nA further 26 places will go when\nRayleigh house is sold off this year\nto pay for the furnishings for the new\nEvelyn Gardens block. 30 places will\nbe lost in the new Evelyn complex as\nsub warden rooms and higher priced\nflat accommodation. On top of this 25\nplaces in Evelyn Gardens are to go\naltogether.\nAdding up the losses and the\nprojected gains in student numbers\ngives a probable deficit of 184 places.\nBut at the beginning of this year there\nwere 103 fresher s who had, to be\nhoused in head tenancy flats in\nHamlet Gardens because of the\ncurrent short-fall. Mr Howgate told\nFELIX that this effectively meant that\nover 287 new places were needed to\nBar prices: on the up and up\nmaintain College's guaranteed place\nscheme. Only 200 will have been\ngained by taking over the new Evelyn\nGardens building.\nThis comes as a particular blow to\nstudents who will have to face an\naverage increase of \u00a37.80 on top of\ninflation in their rents over the next\ntwo years. The Union agreed to this\nlast year, in return for the 200 'extra'\nplaces. Part of the deal was a temporary reduction in the number of\nre-applicant places from 8% to 4% of\nplaces available, which would be\nreinstated after a year. The proportion\nof re-ap places was cut from 10% to\n8% when the Freemantle Hotel was\nlost in 1985.\nStudents may be faced with a further increase in rents. The\nCollege's Residence Account is\ncurrently \u00a3215,000 in debt, \u00a3120,000\nas a result of the new Evelyn property\nbeing unoccupied for the past year.\nMr Malcolm Aldridge from the\nCollege Finance Section told FELIX\nyesterday that this debt will get\nsteadily worse if rent increases are\nheld at the rate of inflation. He said\nthat the only alternative would be to\nincrease income from the Summer\nLetting Scheme (SLS) and the\nSummer Accommodation Centre\n(SAC). The SLS money, which\ncomes from letting out Hamlet\nGardens and Evelyn Gardens flats to\nstudents over the long vacations, goes\nto the Residence Account. The SAC\n. profits, made from conference guests\nand casual trade from the Tourist\nBoard in Linstead and Southside over\nEaster and Summer, is currently split\nbetween the Conference Account and\nResidence Account.\nICU President Ian Howgate wants\nto see all the SAC profits going into\nthe Residence Account. He said\nyesterday that this would give the\nAccount an extra \u00a3100,000 pa.\n'Effectively students rents are\nsub sidi sing the Conference Account\nbecause the Conference Office pays\nless for the 400 rooms than students\ndo during term-time,' he told us. 'In\nreturn, they are making around \u00a370\nper room a week. They're making a stinking profit out of residences.' He\nbelieves that within two years the\ndeficit could be completely wiped out.\nMr Aldridge, however, has made\nit clear that this can only be done if\nthe Union is prepared to accept an\nincrease in bar prices. He explained\nthat the Conference profits were\nneeded to pay the interest on a \u00a3lm\nloan they had secured in order to\nrefurbish the- Sherfield Main\nRefectory. He told FELIX that the\nRefectories would have to make\n\u00a3150,000 each year to cover this and\nit was 'obvious to make the money by\nincreasing beer prices.'\nMr Aldridge said that no decisions\ncontinued on back page column 3\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLE OE UNION "

    "content": "lew s Housekeeping( Cert PG)\nThis is the latest film from Bill\nForsyth, director of that brilliant\ncomedy about young love Gregory's Girl.\nHelen Stone drops her two children\nwith her mother before committing\nsuicide. The childrens' grandmother\ntakes devoted care of them until she\ndies seven years later. The children\nare placed in the unwilling care of\nHelen's sister, Sylvie Fisher, and\nslowly grow up.\nOne of the most notable things\nabout Bill Forsyth's films is his\nrefusal, even at the risk of having his\nfilms condemned as 'charming', to\nlend any weight to the elements of\nmyth and magic that lurk below their\nsurface. The elaborate ritual which\nguides the unwitting Gregory to the\ngirl destined to be his sleeping beauty,\nor the influence that Olympian\ngoddesses Stella and Marina wield\nover the affairs of men in Local Hero.\nHousekeeping has the slant-eyed\nview of reality that hallmarks all\nForsyth's previous films; when\ngoaded by the children about the mess\nof old tins littering the kitchen, Sylvie\nlovingly scrubs them all and arranges\nthem in beautiful, gleaming pyramids\non the table.\nHousekeeping is a film about\ngrowing up, about the pressures in the\nworld to conform. The film retains\nmuch of the subtlety of the novel by\nMarilynne Robinson from which it\nwas adapted.\n'To crave and to have are as like\nas a thing and its shadow. For when\ndoes a berry break upon the tongue\nas sweetly as when one longs to taste\nit...and when do our senses know\nanything so utterly as when we lack\nit? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be\nmade whole. For to wish for a hand\non one's hair is all but to feel it. So\nwhatever we may lose, very craving\ngives it back to us again.'\nThe craving the girls experience is\nfor a sense of family, denied to them\nas circumstances pass them along\nfrom one pseudo-family to another.\nThey pore over meaningless\nphotographs, asking eager questions\nabout their parents, and receive only\nvague answers. A shot near the\nbeginning shows the two apparently\nabout to fall from their high window\nperch. Then we see that they are in\nfact safely tethered\u2014but the image is\nthat even family ties are no security.\nThis all may make Housekeeping\nseem like an unbearably grim\nexperience, but it isn't. It's a great\nfilm, one hundred per cent Forsyth in\nmanner and mood.\nThe Lost Boys( Cert 15)\nYet another modern vampire movie,\nfollowing hot on the heels of last\nweek's Near Dark.\nIn the small California town of\nSanta Clara, the two teenage sons of\njust-divorced Lucy Emerson, Michael\nand Sam, run into trouble. Sam is\nwarned by the owners of the local\ncomic-book store that the town is\ninfested with vampires. Michael is\ntricked into drinking blood, and is\nhalf turned into a vampire. Sam\nrealises what's going on when his\nbrother's reflection starts to fade, but\nhe can be saved if the local head\nvampire is destroyed before Michael\nmakes his first kill.\nThe Lost Boys is an uneven film,\nreflecting the fact that it's been kicked\naround by and rewritten by too many\npeople. It was originally supposed to\nbe a sort of Peter Pan, but has been\nstripped of all its J M Barrie\nassociations, except for the title and\nthe mixing of the kindly father figure\nand head villi an into one role. The\nfilm does have a few witty lines, but\nit seems that the influence of co-producer Richard Donner has been far\ntoo strong\u2014in parts, The Lost Boys\ngets uncomfortable like The Goonies,\nwhich Donner directed for Steven\nSpielberg. In one sequence, the young\nkids run screaming through a maze of\ncaves infested with teenage vampires\nwho hang upside down from the\nroof\u2014too close to The Goonies for\ncomfort.\nThe film is firmly directed towards\ncommer ical is m \u2014MTV rock, pretty-boy teen vampires with trendy clothes\nand haircuts, doses of comedy\nwhenever anything starts getting too\nhorrific, special effects trickery and\nSpielbergian flying scenes. All this\neats away at the fascinating potential\nof the vampire genre; in fact, The Lost\nBoys is the complete opposite to Near\nDark. The film seems to start\npromisingly enough, with on-the-streets footage of listless weirdos\nhanging around the streets of Santa\nClara, drifting from boardwalk to\nfairground. But the introduction of\njunior Rambos who talk comically\ntough, combined with the heavy doses\nof garlic-throwing slapstick and\ns mark alec exchanges, all combine to\nspoil the film.\nThe Lost Boys tries to be another\nFright Night, and fails; it has none of\nthe class of the previous movie. It\nisn't as funny, frightening or striking\nas Fright Night because it doesn't have a consistent tone. This is a shame, since there are some fairly\nexciting melt down effects, and one\nor two eerie touches, such as the\nvampires stepping off a bridge to\ndisappear into the fog below.\nProbably the worst thing about the\nfilm is the fact that it's villains aren't at all frightening, but very stupid,\nblundering into all sorts of traps. I came out of the film wishing that the\nvampires had got the panicky,\ntiresomely hyperactive crew of junior\nbrats that are supposed to be the\nheroes.\nIf you must go and see a vampire\nmovie, see Near Dark\u2014it's thoughtful, funny and well vm&t. The\nLost Boys has good effects, some\nfunny lines, but loses out when it\ncomes to likeability.\nL/7Z M The Glass Menagerie Paul Newman manages to step from\nimpressive achievement to impressive\nachievement and his direction of The\nGlass Menagerie is no exception. The\nfilm is really a film-of-the-play by\nTennessee Williams, who regarded it\nas an attempt to break away from\nconventional theatre and 'the\nphotographic in art'. The film is a perfect photographic record of the\nplay\u2014yet Newman manages to\ncircumnavigate this fact\u2014the actor's cinema, in the best sense, creating\nfrom theatrical ensembles and interior\ndramas an undeniably cinematic\nmood.\nNewman directs his excellent cast\nexpertly, and doesn't succumb to the\ntemptation of 'opening' everything\nup, which would have totally\ndestroyed the atmosphere.\nThe central image of the film is\nlight: light symbolises both the pain\nand in extinguish ability of memory.\nDim lighting is remembrance. Lights\nfrom the dance hall across the street\nare a distraction from enclosed family\nlife. The prisms of light in the\nmenagerie are refugees from the\nshadows outside. Then all light is lost,\nbecause the family can't pay their\nbills. So candlelight takes over-radiance at the expectation of life.\nThe Glass Menagerie is this week's 'deep' film. It's long, but well worth\nsitting through if you're one of those\npeople who likes a lot of intelligence\nand no gunshots in your films. I thought it was excellent.\nSammy and Rosie Get Laid\n(Cert 18)\nFrom the director of My Beautiful\nLaundrette comes a tale of society\nthreatened by anarchy and disorder.\nIt opens with vistas of urban waste\nand squalor, Margaret Thatcher's voice-over ordering the inner cities to\nheal themselves through hard work\nand hope. But, unfortunately, the film\nisn't nearly as good as My Beautiful\nLaundrette\u2014Hit characters are a bit\ntoo one dimensional, and the\nsketching in of family and social\nrelationships is too episodic. The\nmain character\u2014an ex-colonial\nfreedom fighter, Rafi Rahmancommits suicide. In the wake of this,\nit's difficult to care whether or not\nSammy and Rosie do indeed get laid.\nSammy and Rosie Get Laid is worth\na look if you're really keen on\ncontemporary 'thinking' films.\nMasters of the Universe Why oh why? This film i \u00ab designed\nto merchandise the brand of toys of\nthe same name, and to induce utter\nmisery in anyone over ten. Stay at\nhome and watch Eastenders instead.\nThis film is the genuine article-complete crap. Even the cartoon\nseries is better.\nFELIX Friday January 22nd198813 "

Far from it\nbeing 'just another' dance competition\nthe evening promises to be a spectacular event to watch and/or\nparticipate in.\nGenerous sponsorship from Grant\nThornton Chartered Accountants has\nenabled us to book an exciting and\ntalented dance group by the name of\nthe Kansas City Jivers. Their lead\ndancer is presently the British FreeStyle Dance Champion.\nThe student rock 'n' roll event,\nhopes to attract entries from all over\nthe country, hence the early start of\n5.30pm. These couples will perform\none minute of intricate continental\nstyle footwork followed by a further\ntwo minutes of dazzling and\nsometimes dangerous acrobatics in\neach of the elimination rounds. Only\nsix couples will reach the final.\nIn addition to the above event there\nwill be a more light-hearted event\nopen to anyone and everyone as long\nas they follow these few rules:\n1. Couples only (but - any\ncombination of sexes is acceptable!!).\n2. Absolutely no acrobatics.\n3. Winners will be judged on\nentertainment value based on style of\ndress as well as style of dance.\nLast year nearly everybody that\nattended the evening entered this\nevent.\nThroughout the evening there will\nbe plenty of opportunity to dance,\nlearn to dance or even just to watch\nthe dancing. There may be a few\nlight-hearted competitions and there\nwill be a bar available with light\nrefreshments. The evening is due to\nstart at 5.30pm in the Great Hall,\nSherfield Building. Tickets are only\n\u00a33 available from Neil McCluskey\n(Min Tech 3), Dinah Woodhurst\n(Physics 3) or from the Union Office.\nEverybody is welcome, staff,\nstudents, dancers, non-dancers.\nSupport will be particularly\nappreciated for the Imperial College\ncouples competing which included the\ndefending Student Rock 'n' Roll\nChampions.\nIC YHA\nEscape to somewhere wild\nHave you ever thought about escaping\nfrom IC into some wild part of\nBritain, to relax, take in fresh air, and\nre vital is e your mental state?\nICYHA can take you away from\nLondon to the vast, desolate moors of\nthe Peaks or Dartmoor, to the\nspectacular hills of Snowdonia or\nBrecon, to the rolling lands of the\nPurbeck coastline, or the quiet world:\nof the New Forest.\nLast term ICYHA travelled to these\ndestinations, on average, about a dozen people packing into a minibus\non Friday nights, to spend the\nweekend away. Usually walking. We\nmay split into smaller groups\nfollowing different routines, the\nclub's activities should be within\neveryone's reach. Accommodation is\narranged, of course, in Youth Hostels\nand is essentially basic but using a small hostel hidden in the trees of\nDartmoor Village makes a great\nalternative to Linstead Hall or Evelyn\nGardens.\nThis term we plan to go up to the\nmoors and dales of Yorkshire, down\nto Exmoor and at Easter to Scotland.\nThe groups are friendly and the\nweekend vacations are excellent.

The surprise\nmeeting caught the entire RSMU\nunawares, so that they were unable\nto muster even a single representative,\ndespite the extensive publicity (one\nsmall advert in FELIX).\nThe meeting got off to a bang with\nChair Al Seymour barking into the\nspeakers at top volume, churning\nstomachs even more than a McNorthey burger.\nBefore anyone could even eat a chip, Beans Club stooge Martyn Peck\nmoved the meeting on to their motion;\ncontroversial stuff, involving the\nadoption of the characters from\nRainbow as new CCU mascots.

Not content\nwith this he felt that ICU External\nAffairs Officer Neil Motteram should\nalso be given the chop. Ian protested\nthat Neil hadn't done anything for a term and didn't even attend the GUC\nmeetings which his job dec rip tion demanded. Poor old Neil was no-confidence d for the second time and\nthus lost his post. Where will it all\nlead to\u2014will other Union officers be\nexpected to do work as well?

It would\nseem for all our\nquest for freedom,\nwe still cling onto,\nand even\nencourage, some\nelement of predestination to our\nexistence.\nNOSTRA\nDAMUS\nb>vI VIe irt in Cole While soothsayers specialising in the\nstudy of slaughtered lamb entrails\nhave little place in modern day\nsociety, astro logi sts have established\na lucrative little niche for themselves\nthrough the tabloids and various other\npublications of similar standing. But\nastrology has been around for a long\ntime, with perhaps its greatest\nexponent being one Michel de\nNostradamus\u2014will anyone remember\nRussell Grant in 400 years time?\nSo, who was Nostradamus and why\nhas he not faded into the same\nobscurity of others of his ilk?\nNostradamus was a sixteenth\ncentury French seer (almost\nindisputable fact), who predicted\nevents such as the rise of Napoleon,\nHitler, the assassination of J F Kennedy and the Ayatollah (absolute\nconjecture!). It is of immediate\nappa rence that his predictions were\ncharacterised by predictions of doom;\nand why not? Even the most cursory\nstudy of human history will reveal\nthat, if we are predict i ble at all then,\nfor certain we will go to war, have\nevil leaders, and plenty of\nassassinations to boot! Predicting\nbeneficial and Utopian futures is best\nleft to campaigning politicians and\nreligious leaders.\nSo why, having discredited his\npredictions, are they still worth\nwriting about? Well, however his\nprophecies are taken, they make an\ninteresting read, but even better are\nthe tenuous deductions and\ninterpretations made by the various\nexperts; their logic is always\ninfallible(!).\nTo make things difficult the\n'quatrains', as they are called, are\nwritten in old French rhyme,\ncollected into ten centuries, each with\n100 quatrains (apart from the seventh,\nwhich mysteriously contains only\n42\u2014is this the answer to life the\nuniverse and everything?). Unless\nyou are fluent at French, it is\nnecessary to rely on official\ntranslations, usually by people only\ntoo willing to further the legend. And,\nif this was not enough, the quatrains\nare deliberately obscure, ambiguous\nand chronologically jumbled: the\nexplanation being that Nostradamus\ndid not want to risk prosecution as a magician\u2014very convenient!\nOne of the popular themes of\nNostradamus, was the effect of three\nbrothers on the world, commonly\nbelieved to be a reference to the\nKennedy's and one must concede that\nno three brothers have had greater\npotential influence on the world\n(excluding Andy, Robin and Maurice\nGibb, of course). Nostradamus\n'foresaw' their assassinations. Saving\nyou the French:\n8 Friday January 22nd1988 FELIX\n\n"

Eye\nwitnesses report kinky chase-me\ngames in the Union Office after sordid\nSRC meetings.\n\u2022 THE CHAIRMAN of Ham Radio\nSoc was so keen to complete a questionnaire about his lecturers that\nhe turned Physics Theatre One into\nhis personal assault course last week.\nPhil 'Rambo' Pavelin scaled 4\nbenches, sprinted across the front of\nthe room only to find the papers to\nhave been removed by the ACC reps.\nHe crept back to his row and st eat hi ly crawled on all fours along the bench\nto his seat.

The balding\nphysicist said, 'at least I don't scrape\nit across the top of my head in a Bobby Charlton style, like some of\nmy lecturers'.\n\u2022 BRIBES ARE still being offered\nfor news on the goings on of IC Radio\nStation Manager Steve Gutteridge and\nex, John Allen.\n\u2022 SEXY, POUTING FELIX Editor\nJudith Hackney has a skeleton in her\ncloset, she has admitted to being a member of the Marillion fan club.\nRumour has it that she was spotted\nthis week at a concert of her fave band\nbut has rejected suggestions that she\ncaught a pair of Fish's underpants in\nher teeth when they were thrown into\nthe audience by the singer.\n\u2022 FIASCO OF THE WEEK was the\nIC Radio Annual Dinner last\nSaturday. The event was marred by\na mix-up concerning the cost. It was\n\u00a34 more per head than everybody\nexpected. Valiant ex-Secretary and\ndinner organiser Simon Bradshaw (ex\nbecause he resigned just before the\ndinner!) dramatically announced that\nhe would pay the excess. However,\nmy spies inform me that the money\nwill come from IC Radio's special\nfund made up from profits from the\nsoft drinks they sell to members.\nJohn Secretary put the top back on his\nmarker and looked at the poster he\nhad just drawn. 'Coming Soon\u2014the\nCheapskate Supermarket closing\ndown sale\u2014everything must go!'\nThis was John's latest idea to save\nsome of the Baron's money, and\nwould also mean that he could stop\nissuing those annoying trolley\nlicences. The Cheapskate\nsupermarket would be closed and all\nthe little corner shops in the 16\ndifferent schools expanded to sell\nmore things. The little elves who\nworked in the supermarket were not\nat all pleased with John Secretary's plan as they feared that the first thing\nto be sold would be their jobs.\nJohn Secretary had got his wonderful idea from talking to the\nKommandant of the Thinbread dormitory about a jumble sale he had\norganised. Fed up with all the citizens who had left their rubbish in\nhis wine cellar, he and the dormitory club decided to sell it all and\nuse the money to buy some decent wine for a big booze up they were\nplanning to celebrate that the dormitory was 20 years old and it still\nhadn't fallen down. Unfortunately, some of the things they sold were\nnot rubbish but belonged to citizens from far away lands who had\nleft them there for safe keeping. When they found out, the citizens\nwere very angry because some of them had left very expensive toys\ndown there. One female citizen even claimed to have lost skiing\nequipment worth 3 times as much as ALL the rubbish was sold for...\nThe citizen's leader, Ian Whygate, didn't have much to say (for a change) because he was looking after the newest slave in the citizens'\noffice. Reggie Blenheimpalace was the new counter of all the citizens'\nmoney, but when he arrived he couldn't even count himself lucky\nenough to have a desk. 'Never mind' thought Reggie, 'I 'll go for a wander around'. He soon found himself in the Phallix office where\nhe was accosted by Largeamounts who wanted to 'take some photos\nfor the files'. They then disappeared down towards the Jacques\nCousteau Club's bottle store...\nMeanwhile, things were happening in the many sections of the\nCheapskate media.\nThrilled by the success (?) of the combined Lumpofmetalworshippers/Fundamentallawsofnaturetesters radio show, Dave\nBraincell and Clare MacUseless had decided to go one better. They\nwould now be doing a show for the Citizens' Television of Cheapskate.\nThis was an abrupt change of opinion by Braincell. At the last citizens'\ncommittee meeting he was complaining that the TV station was a waste of money and should be closed. Director General Mark\nWinchester was certainly having the last laugh...\n(Clare MacUseless had also taken a leaf out of Whygate's book by\nhaving a new hairstyle so that no one would recognise her.)\nOver at Radio Cheapskate, controller Steve Garbage was having\ntroubles of his own. If the equipment wasn't breaking down, then\nhis credibility was. Rumours were flying about him and a former citizen\nbut all the Cheapskate disc jockeys were keeping very quiet (for a change).\nIt was easy to tell that the Cheapskate general elections were\ncoming up just by reading Phallix. Last week's prize for the 'most\npublicity in a single issue' goes to the diminutive citizen who managed\nno less than 10 name checks and a photo...\nSomeone else keen to appear in Phallix was one of the Baron's new\nslaves from the 'sending documents down the telephone' office in\nthe Surefield forties?. Hip Eddy was very hip apart from one\nunfortunate thing. His favourite football team was that boring bunch\nof North Londoners from Highbury, Arsehole.\nWhy are boring Arsehole live on TV on Sunday?\nI Will Dave BraincelTs live Subbuteo match on Cheapskate TV be\nj more exciting?\nFind out in the next episode of The Baron of Cheapskate\n\u2022 SABBATICAL ELECTIONS are\non the way. It's easy to tell this\nbecause many of the hopefuls have\nbeen seen entering the FELIX Office\nin order to secure some early and free\npublicity from Editor Judith Hackney.\nMany suggest a small mention in the\nBaron would be ideal. Others are all\ntoo free in imparting gossip about\nthemselves, in the hope of getting into\nthis very libel column. Tough luck,\nkids. I didn't take the bait!\n\u2022 IT SEEMS THAT many of the\nCollege elections have already been\nsewn up. A little bird told me\nyesterday that Dramsoc have next\nyear's committee already sorted out,\nor Adrian Hicks seems to think they\ndo anyway. Naturally Adrian is\nputting himself forward for\nDramsoc's President.\n\u2022 MEANWHILE IT'S a safe bet that\nRag Chairman Nigel Baker will win\nthe ICU presidential election this year\naccording to his newly formed\nelection team. A certain other Union\nOfficer, who was originally planning\nto stand for the big 'P', has decided\nit's not worth it now and has joined\nthe Baker camp with the intention of\nrunning as Deputy.\n\u2022 A NEW ' CAMP' has announced\nits intention to run in the ICU\nelections. Women's Officer Linzi\nWishart and Lesbian & Gay Welfare\nOfficer James Papa are planning to\nstand for President and Deputy\nPresident respectively.\n\u2022 HOL BE IN HOUSE had a porno\nnight this Monday attended by not\nonly the Warden but also the two\nSubwardens after a night of heavy\ndrinking. Two residents were unable\nto contain themselves while watching\none film and ended up prancing naked\naround the TV room. My spy tells me\nthat they broke all-known house\nrecords and managed a5 in-a shower\norgy including one female wearing\nnothing but an enormous grin.\n\u2022 ROSE ATKINS photogenic\ntypesetter operator, was recently\noverheard complaining about the fact\nthat she had not been given a double\npage feature interview when starting\nwork for FELIX this time last year\nand was upset at the fact that Chris\nMartin did not ask Reggie\nBlennerhassett, the new Finance\nOfficer, what he thought of the Snack\nBar food as she would have had a very\ngood answer to this question had she\nbeen asked.\nI Chris Jones\nFELIX Friday January 22nd19887 "
