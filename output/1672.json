Ok, so\nmaybe it\u2019s not as bad as\nglobal poverty, or removal\nof the SCR breakfasts, but\nit\u2019s still pretty bad. We just\nabout managed to get the\npaper out, but we knew\nthat this week would be\ndifficult.\nWe\u2019ve had to put\ntogether this issue on a\nsingle computer in the\nWest Basement, and\nwhile I would love to say\nI worked myself to the\nbone getting this issue out,\nthat simply isn\u2019t the truth.\nReally, the paper is only\nin your hands right now\nbecause of the dedication\nof a wonderful team of\nwriters and editors, who\npulled out all the stops\nto make sure that things\nwent smoothly this week.\nI can\u2019t thank them enough.\nBut moving onto something more exciting: grad-uation! A time when the\ncampus is deluged under\na flood of black cloaks,\nanxious parents, and lots\nof selfies in front of the\nlibrary cafe (after all, it\u2019s\nprobably fed you more\ntimes that your mother has\nin the last few years).\nI graduated for the\nfirst time from King\u2019s \u2013 I\nknow, I know. It was a\npretty fun day, but I don\u2019t\nthink any of the pomp and\ncircumstance compares to\nwhat happened before the\nceremony: it was held at\nBarbican, which is located\nin central London, next to\na series of water gardens.\nSince my graduation was\nearly, we got there before\nthe fountains were turned\non, and as a result lots of\npeople were hopping in\nthe basins to take photos in\nall their finery. The clock\nhit 10am, however, and lo\nand behold: the sound of\nshrieking echoed across\nthe foyer as graduands\nwere promptly drenched.\nMy mum had gone\nto the loo at that point,\nand she was gutted she\nmissed out. In fact, she\nspent the remainder of\nthe day talking about how\npointless the whole day\nwas, since I\u2019d only been\nat King\u2019s less than a year,\nand \u201cyou don\u2019t really\nknow anyone, do you?\u201d\nThanks ma!\nEnough about me. For\nthe last few years I\u2019ve\nalways been off-campus\non the day of graduation,\nand so I\u2019ve missed the\natmosphere. I\u2019d always\nthought \u2013 judging from\nthe pictures \u2013 that it would\nbe crowded, hectic, and\npretty awful, and it is. But\nthere\u2019s also a celebratory\natmosphere that was\nlovely to see. From aunties\nin Kente cloth tearing\nup as they take photos of\ntheir beloved family, or\nconfused parents being\nshepherded to Beit Quad,\nit\u2019s lovely to see everyone\ncome together and witness\nthe world\u2019s most expensive handshake.\nWe even got in on\nthe action in the West\nBasement, taking photos\nof graduates with their\nfamilies, until this was\npromptly shut down by\nthe College, who claimed\ntheir preferred studio had\na monopoly on photography that day. I checked\nthough, and there were\nplenty of you guys posting\nfab selfies on the gram, so\nthey can\u2019t have complete\ncontrol. Oh well. There\u2019s\nalways next year.\nGet involved with Felix!\nWe\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, illustrators, grammar nerds, and\ncomputer whizz-kids\nIf you\u2019re interested, drop us a line on felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "LIBERATION\nFRIDAY, 20TH\nOCTOBER, 2017 FELIX\n26\nicu-bme@imperial.ac.uk\nWorking to create a truly global\nuniversity\nLast week\u2019s Race Disparity Report revealed how BME students are being let\ndown by a culture of racism \u2013 and it\u2019s time Imperial addressed this.\nLIBERATION\nChimdi Igwe\nBME Liberation Officer\nJ\nust last week, the\ngovernment released\nits sixty-odd page\nRace Disparity\nReport, commissioned\nby the Prime Minister\nTheresa May early on\nin her tenure. The main\ntakeaway, as the report\u2019s\nname handily notes,\nwas the general trend of\ndisparity between minority experiences across the\nboard: from education and\nhousing to employment\nand health.\nThe \u2018shock\u2019 revelation\nthat that Britain could be\ninstitutionally racist would\nlikely fail the plagiarism\ntest on Turnitin. This is no\nnovel conclusion here \u2013 in\nfact, this isn\u2019t even the\nfirst report this decade\nto say this (we do live in\nthe centre of the former\nEmpire).\nOne part of the report\nnotes that some ethnic\nminority students outperform their white counterparts in attainment levels\nin compulsory education\n(GCSEs). Interestingly,\nthis doesn\u2019t necessarily\ntranslate to further education \u2013 studies of UK\nuniversities imply an\nattainment gap in terms\nof university performance\nacross the UK with respect\nto ethnicity. On top of this,\ncurricula often lack an\ninclusive approach \u2013 the\nrecent changes to the\nOxford history course\ncome to mind.\nHere at Imperial,\nthough, raising these kinds\nof concerns can often be\ntricky: as a STEM uni-versity, excuses like \u2018race\nhas no place in science\u2019\nand \u2018we don\u2019t do that\nhumanities b***s***\u2019 are\nvery much used in order\nto avoid conversations\nthat are necessary for the\nCollege to improve.\nOne of the more fashionable excuses is the\ninability to see race (\u2018I\ndon\u2019t see colour\u2019), usually\ndone in an attempt at ap-peasement. This, though\nwell-meaning, can be the\nworst thing to do \u2013 refusing\nto notice or acknowledge a\nperson\u2019s race and ethnicity\nis in effect wilfully erasing\npart of their identity.\nThis ability to completely ignore race in a situation\nis in itself something that\ncan only be afforded to\npeople for whom race has\nno impact on their way of\nlife \u2013 for many, their life\nexperiences are defined\nby not just their cultural\nbackground, but the\nawareness of being \u2018other\u2019\nin their home community.\nSadly, wilful ignorance of\nthis sort is why we often\ndescribe racism in the\nUK as being institutional;\nit arises from apathy as\nopposed to action.\nThe College\u2019s mission\nstatement and vision\nincorporate the notion of\nbeing not just a world-class university, but a\nglobal one. But how can\nwe claim to be such an\ninstitution when the university isn\u2019t reflective of\nthe globe?\nThis is not implying\nthat Imperial must\nsuddenly and abruptly\nchange its admissions\npolicies to ensure equal\nrepresentation of \u2018the\nraces\u2019 according to global\nstandards (that borders on\npositive discrimination,\nwhich by the way is illegal\nin the UK), but we do need\nto reconsider how we are\nperceived, how we engage\nprospective students, and\nhow we facilitate current\nstudents\u2019 experiences in\nstriving for this excel-lence.\nFor information on\nwhat\u2019s happening at the\nUnion over Black History\nMonth, check out http://\nbit.ly/2gn5tQ4 . If you\nhave any suggestions\nyou\u2019d like to see, hit\nChimdi up at icu_bme@\nimperial.ac.uk\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nI\nt\u2019s rather tricky to run for a position that\nisn\u2019t well defined \u2013 earlier this year, while\ncampaigning for the role of BME Officer,\nmore often than not I\u2019d have to explain\nwhat the whole acronym meant (for those\nof you who still don\u2019t know, that\u2019s Black and\nMinority Ethnic); even then I\u2019d have to try to\nexplain what this role is meant to be.\nNow, the observant amongst you smart\nImperial students might have noticed that\nthe general campus flavour is somewhat\ncomparable to Becky\u2019s \u2018roast chicken\u2019. That\nisn\u2019t at all reflective of global excellence, and,\nas such, the views of students from ethnic\nminorities can often be overshadowed.\nAsaLiberationOfficer,myprimaryroleisto\nensure those underrepresented at Imperial\nare heard equally; that their concerns are\nput to the Union as equally as those from\nany other part of the world \u2013 whether it be\ndealing with poorly named events (side-eye\nto slave auctions) or occasionally switching\nthe music up in Metric.\nFirst on the agenda: Black History\nMonth. Seeing as 2017 marks 30 years of\nits establishment, I, along with the African\nCaribbean Society (ACS), Imperial As One\n(the staff BME network), and the Union, have\nbeen planning numerous events on campus.\nEvery Wednesday this month the QTR\nand SCR have prepared a dish inspired by\nblack cultures around the world (you\u2019ve still\ngot a week to try them out \u2013 get you some\nspice in your life); we\u2019ve hosted the award-winning rapper and activist Akala speaking\nhere at Imperial; and yesterday ACS hosted\nanother talk on the history of pre-slave trade\nAfrica. There\u2019s also the College Black History\nLecture to look forward to next Friday.\nOf course, my focus up till now has around\nblack students, but that\u2019s not the totality\nof my liberation zone: each culture here\nat Imperial is unique and deserves to be\nshowcased and celebrated \u2013 it\u2019s my aim to\nfacilitate that.\nLIBERATION\nChimdi Igwe\nBME Liberation Officer\nCan we make Imperial a uni for the many, not the few? // Imperial/Layton Thompson\n\u201cHow can\nwe claim to\nbe a global\ninstitution\nwhen the\nuniversity isn\u2019t\nreflective of\nthe globe?\u201d\n\n"

A fan of Benedict\nCumberbatch and all\nthings \u2018detective-ey\u2019,\nI decided on When We\nWere Orphans, by Kazuo\nIshiguro. Reading this\nstory recovered my lost\nlove of reading and ignited\na new passion for writing.\nPublished in 2000, it\nremained my favourite\nbook even ten years later.\nIt is well-deserved, and\nwith Christopher, an odd\nbut loveable man that I\nstill miss now. Christopher\u2019s journey begins\nas a renowned London\ndetective, modelled on\nthe likes of Sherlock (but\nwith social acceptance\nand without the illicit drug\nuse, so not that much like\nSherlock) who transforms\ninto a brave crusader for\njustice, with the story\u2019s\nclimax happening on the\nfront lines in war-torn\nShanghai where he experiences death and pain to\nfind the truth, while in the\nprocess risking his happi-ly-ever-after. He travels\nin search of an answer to\nthe mysterious and unexplained disappearance of\nhis parents as a boy \u2013 the\nultimate case of his career\nand the question his life\nhad been building up to\nanswer. The tension is high\nand the action is thrilling.\nThe will-they-won\u2019tthey between Christopher\nand his lady-friend Sarah\nis tantalising. If you are\nstarting to get worried\nthat Ishiguro is an action\nwriter and not for you, I\ncan assure you that he can\nwrite romance. Perhaps\nnot in the sexually graphic\nway of Murakami, but he\ncreates a depth in his characters\u2019 relationships that is\nrelatable and real. Ishiguro\nuses the ever-unreliable\nmemory to reveal the\nevents and truths behind\na friendship or a romance.\nAs with relationships,\nmemories greatly affect\nour lives. Memories are\nfascinating things, they\nremain with us whether\nwe want it or not, and what\nwe decide to remember\nand what we don\u2019t at times\nfeels out of our control.\nFor example, I can\nremember the name of my\nmum\u2019s school friend even\nthough we have never\nmet. However I cannot,\nunder any circumstances,\nremember the password\nto my work email. It is not\njust Christopher\u2019s story\nthat is intensified by the\nfrustrations of a biased\nmemory. In Ishiguro\u2019s\nrecent and, in my opinion,\nmost beautiful book, The\nBuried Giant, he explores\nagain the nature of how\ninfluential yet fragile our\nmemories are, and the\nanxiety that comes with\ndefeated, with heroes,\nknights, King Arthur:\nundoubtedly all the well-loved elements of fantasy.\nMemory is not the only\nthing to change with time,\nand as his characters grow,\nso do their relationships.\nThe Buried Giant presents\nan aged kind of love, a\nmarriage that has been\nbattered and bruised, until\ncommitment is stronger\nthan any flame which may\nhave once been lit. In much\nof Ishiguro\u2019s work, I see\nthe tenderness of family\nand companionship.\nIf it isn\u2019t clear, I think\nIshiguro more than\ndeserves his Nobel Prize,\nand if you haven\u2019t read\nanything by him, then\nplease do. Ishiguro\u2019s\ncharacters are so real\nthat we can see pieces of\nourselves in them. He tells\na story with such fluid\nsimplicity, with only just\nenough detail but all of it\ncrucial. His books are, if\none thing, entertaining. He\nmakes it look easy.\nKazuo Ishiguro\u2019s novels reveal themselves with a fluid simplicity, and a quiet grace // Vintage/Nobel Media/Faber and Faber\n\u201cReading\nWhen We\nWere Orphans\nrecovered my\nlost love of\nreading, and\nignited a new\npassion for\nwriting\u201d\nof no surprise to me, that\nIshiguro was this month\nawarded the Nobel Prize\nfor Literature.\nIshiguro presented me\n\u201cKazuo\nIshiguro more\nthan deserves\nhis Nobel Prize\nin literature\u201d\nlosing them. It\u2019s hard to tell\nwhether emotions cloud\nmemories, or the other\nway round. Dementia,\na word I imagine many\nreaders thought of as they\nread this historical Roman-inspired adventure, is\nin this book not the image\nof a diseased memory but\ntransformed into a magical\ndragon, a demon to be\n\n"

Rather than\ntaking the Wachowskian\napproach to dystopia that\nwas popular at the turn of\nthe century and have technology enslave humans,\nBlack Mirror shows\nus what happens when\ntechnology liberates us to\nbe the worst versions of\nourselves; it takes plausible ideas based in our own\nreality and extends those\nto what could happen soon\nif we don\u2019t sit up and take\nnotice. But as we enter a\nsurreal age of misinforma-tion, where TV stars rule\ncountries and automation\nslides ever closer to re-ality, is a dismal forecast\nthe best way to inspire a\nhealthier discussion about\ntechnology and its place in\nour future?\nSome might argue that\nBlack Mirror\u2019s bedtime\nstories aren\u2019t necessary in\ntoday\u2019s political climate.\nThe show does have a\nlong history of seeming\nto predict notable news\nstories: David Cameron\u2019s\npig fracas could have\ninspired the central\nplotline in The National\nAnthem, China\u2019s proposed\nsocial rating system is a\ndirect rip of Nosedive,\nand many might find\nthe election of an odd-ly-coloured, populist television star in The Waldo\nMoment vaguely reminiscent of President Trump\u2019s\nsurprise election win late\nlast year. These bizarre\ncoincidences are less\nindicative of Brooker\u2019s\nability to read the future,\nhowever, than they are of\nan increasingly surreal po-litico-technological land-scape. Research shows\nthat we enjoy horror and\nthrillers as it allows us to\nexperience these emotions\nin a controlled environ-ment, and probably also\nexplains my love of crying\nat Marley and Me. But as\nthat controlled environment starts to looks more\nand more like what we\nsee on our screens, these\nfilms and shows become\nmore than just a cathartic\nrelease of emotion. It\u2019s as\nif that girl from The Ring\nhas just crawled out of the\ntelevision, except she\u2019s an\niPhone with facial recognition software.\nBlack Mirror can only\nget as scary as Charlie\nBrooker can imagine, but\nreality is not bound by one\nman\u2019s imagination, and\ntechnology seems primed\n\u201cBlack Mirror\ncan only be as\nscary as Charlie\nBrooker\u2019s\nimagination,\nbut reality is\nnot bound\u201d\n\u201cWe must take\nappropriate\naction to\nensure that\nwhen these\ntechnologies\ndo take over\nwe are ready\u201d\nto make any episode look\nquite cosy in comparison.\nJust this year we\u2019ve seen\nhow misinformation can\ntake control of electoral\nprocesses (I know it\u2019s\nnot just me that has an\nold aunt or weird cousin\nthat shared some bullshit\nabout Corbyn). Meme\nculture promotes opinion\nover fact, as being in on\nwhat is effectively a glorified inside joke is more\nappealing than engaging\nin discussion. Rightly or\nwrongly, the Momentum/\nMoggmentum movements\nhave already played a\nhuge part in June\u2019s general\nelection, increasing the\nyouth vote by 20% this\nsummer. The part that the\ninternet and memes have\nplayed is not to be under-stated.\nThis phenomenon of\nconfirmation culture is\nnot even restricted to\nfollowers of political\ncandidates. Trump\u2019s oft\nrepeated \u201cFake News\u201d is\nnot only emblematic of\nthe problem, but also the\nreason many are distrustful\nof news that don\u2019t serve to\nconfirm what they already\nbelieve. Thousands see\nthis disregard for traditional news media to be\nrefreshing: a welcome\nbreak from the boring\nbureaucracy of politics.\nExpensively produced\nexecution and recruitment\nvideos on IsisTV (Channel\n608) also serve to make\npolitics and war more\nexciting, bringing the\nhorrors of the battlefield\nmore in line with what\nwe\u2019ve come to expect,\nexcept without James\nBond saving the day. Far\nfrom encouraging productive debate, platforms like\nTwitter and Facebook only\nserve to amplify what we\nare already comfortable\nin believing and keep our\necho chambers sound-proof. News stories are\nshared a thousand times\nbefore someone looks\nat the sources. Is it any\nwonder we turn to TV for\nnice, simple problems to\nsolve like swarms of killer\nbees?\nBrooker isn\u2019t alone in\nhis mistrust in humanity\u2019s\nobsession with the advancement of technology.\nBlack Mirror is just the\nlatest dystopian sci-fi,\ncounting classics like\n1984, The Matrix, and\nBlade Runner as its an-cestors. In many of these\nearly dystopias, humans\neventually win out against\ntech, and return to a harmonious world, but Black\nMirror does not afford us\nthis reassurance, choosing\nto emphasise the control\ndevices can and will\nhave if our usage of them\ngoes unchecked. Like its\npredecessors, the show\nfocuses on how the way\nhumans use technology\nis bad, rather than technology being inherently\nawful. This suggests that\ndystopian horror is not a\ngiven, as long as we use\ntech for good, rather than\ncompounding the worst\nparts of human nature.\nNot all sci-fi landscapes\nset in the near future\nimagine it as a haunted\nhouse of devices. The\nmost positive vision of our\nfuture in recent memory\nis Spike Jonze\u2019s Her.\nSure, the neon lights and\nhigh-rise buildings are\npresent as we\u2019ve come to\nexpect, but Her gives us a\nbright walk through what\nlife could look like. This\noptimism is reflected in\nthe films colour palette:\nbright blues and deep\nreds mirror the setting,\nwhere technology allows\npeople to pursue artistic\nendeavours. Wide open\ncityscapes are a welcome\ncontrast to the cramped\nalien worlds that usually\noccupy our screens. This\nfuture could be ours in the\nnext 20 years, provided\nthat we are able to strike\nthe right balance with\nautomation.\nThe right approach\nto a world increasingly\ndominated by and dependant on our computers is\nsomewhere between these\ntwo extremes. Dating your\noperating system is no\nbetter advice than giving\nup tech for good. We must\nbe aware of the dangers\nthat automation, virtual\nreality, and AI pose to our\nhappiness, and take appropriate action to ensure that\nwhen these technologies\ndo take over (and I believe\nthey will) we are ready for\nthem. My prognosis is a\nreturn to the excitement\nfor technological advancement popular in the\n1950s, with a healthy dose\nof scepticism of human\nself-regulation.\nBlack Mirror is available on Netflix and with any\nmalevolent consciousness\nthat may or may not be\ntaking your job.\n\u201cDid you see that new Black Mirror episode?

    "content": "ISSUE 1672\nFELIX\n19\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAn operatic nightmare of psychological trauma\nFILM\nA\nn unprecedented level of\ndiscussion was\nprompted when\nthe line-up was announced\nfor the Cannes Film\nFestival in the spring.\nThe new golden age of\ntelevision had continued\nits juggernaut-like pro-cession, penetrating the\nexclusive La Croisette for\nthe very first time, as past\nPalme d\u2019Or winners David\nLynch and Jane Campion\nwere invited to premiere\nnew seasons of their\nshows Twin Peaks and Top\nof the Lake respectively.\nStreaming giant Netflix\nalso continued its meteoric\nrise, with two films being\naccepted into the main\ncompetition, albeit with\na warning from festival\ndirector Thierry Fr\u00e9maux\nthat they would not be\nallowed back in the future\nunless they guaranteed\ntheatrical releases in\nFrance. There was excitement at the big name\nauteurs set to compete for\nthe Palme, with the likes\nof Michael Haneke, Todd\nHaynes, Sofia Coppola\nAndrey Zyvagintsev,\nYorgos Lanthimos, Noah\nBaumback, Bong JoonHo, Michel Hazanavicius,\nRuben Ostlund, and Hong\nSang-Soo competing for\nperhaps the most prestigious prize in cinema\nalongside the Academy\nAward.\nAmidst all the fanfare,\nperhaps the most anticipated news was that\nScottish writer-director\nLynne Ramsay was to\nmake her return to the\nsilver screen in partnership with no less than the\ngreat Joaquin Phoenix.\nThe film would also see\nher reuniting with Radiohead guitarist Johnny\nGreenwood, who\u2019s scores\nhave been enthralling us\nfor the past decade ever\nsince the legendary Paul\nThomas Anderson asked\nhim to do the music for\nhis masterpiece There\nWill Be Blood. You Were\nNever Really Here, titled\nA Beautiful Day in France,\nwent to the French Riviera\nunfinished. It was the last\nfilm in competition to be\nshown, and editor Joe Bini\nonly completed his cut a\nmatter of hours before it\nwas due to be screened.\nRamsay stunned the world\nwith Ratcatcher, Morven\nCaller and We Need to Talk\nAbout Kevin in the past,\nand she delivered again,\nreceiving a seven minute\nstanding ovation. She went\non to share the festival\u2019s\nBest Screenplay prize\nwith Yorgos Lantimos and\nEfthymis Filippou for The\nKilling of a Scared Deer,\nwith Phoenix adding to\nhis already bulging trophy\ncabinet with a win for Best\nActor.\nexpressionistic neo-noir\nthriller as You Were Never\nReally Here. The film\nfollows ex-war veteran\nand FBI agent turned gun-for-hire Joe (Phoenix). In\nthe very first scene we join\nhim completing a job, and\nalmost immediately after\nthat visit him at his house\nmid-suicide attempt \u2013 the\nfirst of many efforts \u2013 as\nhe fights to repress the\ndemons of his past. He\nis interrupted by a shout\nfrom his ailing mother\n(Judith Roberts), who he\nlives with and cares for\ndiligently.\nJoe is contacted by\nSenator Albert Votto (Alex\nMannette) to find his\nmissing teenage daughter,\nand hurt those who took\nher from him. He locates\nher fairly quickly in a\nseedy brothel, but as he\nattemptstoreturnhertoher\nfather, his rescue mission\nis suddenly derailed,\nunleashing a maelstrom of\nviolence involving corrupt\npower and vile fantasy,\ntaking him deeper and\ndeeper into the hallucinatory darkness. It would be\nwrong to divulge any of\nthe details of the plot, and\nalso extremely difficult, as\nRamsay creates a swirling,\noperatic nightmare.\nThis is ostensibly a film\nwith elements of action,\nthriller, noir, drama, and\neven horror and comedy.\nFrom the logline, this\ncould easily be clich\u00e9,\nand yet Ramsay and her\ncast and crew elevate it\nto much more. Though\nthe action elements are\nsuperbly visceral, Ramsay\nis more concerned with\nthe psyche of her leading\nman, choosing to delve\ninto trouble that torments\nhim, without ever revealing too much.\nLikewise, Joe Bini\u2019s\nrazor sharp editing aids\nwith this beacon of visual\nstory-telling, only ever\nallowing us a foot in the\ndoor without opening up,\ncontinually rejecting the\nopportunity of exploitation or glamorisation of\nviolence by cutting away\nfrom the action rather\nthan to it. Greenwood\u2019s\neerie score is for the most\npart a driving, electrical\nsymphony, but he balances\nthis delicately, switching it\nup for a majestic underwater scene at a lake.\nAs with her previous\nfilms, Ramsay renounces\nthe spoken word for\nstartling images, always\nchoosing to show rather\nthan tell, and even then\nonly showing glimpses;\nclues to a mystery we will\nnever solve, questions\nwith no answers. Joaquin\nPhoenix proves himself\nto be among the greatest\nactors in the world. Since\nhis return from a self-im-posed break to launch a\nrap career (which turned\nout to be a hoax), he has\nembarked on one of the\nhottest runs any actor has\nexperienced in cinematic\nhistory, comparable, for\nexample, to Jack Nicholson in the early 1970s. He\nis able to communicate so\nmuch in a look or a shift\nin body position, and it is\nhard to imagine anyone\nelse in this role. The scary\nthing is that this would be\ncareer-defining role for\nalmost any other actor\nworking today \u2013 and yet\nPhoenix can do this half-asleep. Stewart introduced\nPhoenix as the man who\nmakes this film, and\nwhile this film is a lesson\nin how having top draw\nartists such as Ramsay and\nGreenwood collaborating\ncan give birth to such\nincredible work, without\nPhoenix this could all\nbreak down to clich\u00e9 and\npretension. When asked to\ncomment on the film, all\nhe said was \u201cthank you all\nfor coming and enjoy the\nfilm\u201d. Wise words.\nYou Were Never Really\nHere will be released in UK\ncinemas on February 23rd\n2018.\nFear and loathing and great acting // British Film Institute\nDir: Lynne Ramsay.

This was a\nmore poignant moment\nbut Cole raised the energy\nonce again, ending his set\nwith \u2018A Tale of 2 Citiez\u2019,\n\u2018G.O.M.D.\u2019, and \u2018No Role\nModelz\u2019 amongst other\nhits from 2014 Forest Hills\nDrive. For an artist that\nis seemingly becoming\nincreasingly reclusive, this\nshow served as a reminder\nof why J. Cole has such\na cult following. His\nmusic connects with the\nmasses, and everyone in\nattendance was captivated\nfrom start to finish by his\npresence. Also, did you\nknow he went platinum\nwith no features?\nSlowdive prove to be worth the wait\nI\nt feels as fun, and\nas relevant playing\ntogether now as it\ndid when we first\nstarted\u201d said Slowdive\u2019s\nNeil Halstead about their\nmuch-anticipated single\n\u2018Star Roving\u2019 upon its\nrelease in January. This\nwas the band\u2019s first new\nmaterial in 22 years.\nSlowdive, a shoegaze\nband from Reading known\nfor their dream-like sound\nand often poignantly sad\nlyrics, were dropped by\ntheir record label in 1995\nafter refusing to make\na pop album. With the\nmusic scene dominated\nby Britpop, Slowdive\nfound themselves a source\nnew, and showed their\nhuge progression as a\nband.\nOther new songs such\nas \u2018Sugar for the Pill\u2019 and\n\u2018No Longer Making Time\u2019\nwere equally successful,\nflaunting their signature\noverwhelming-yet-am-bient sounds arranged in\nrefreshingly new ways.\nThe kaleidoscopic light\nshow behind the band was\nincredible, so absorbing\nthat you often felt like the\nonly one in the room.\nOld tracks retained their\nmagic. The whole crowd,\nwho had been generally\nstill and quiet up to this\npoint in classic shoegaze\nfashion (a genre that\nSlowdive helped pioneer),\ncame alive in the chorus\nof \u2018When the Sun Hits\u2019.\nEveryone sang in unison\nand the emotion in the\nroom was palpable. This\nwhose lyrics are based on\na poem by James Joyce.\nThe music was stripped\nbare as Rachel Goswell\u2019s\nethereal voice held the\nentire crowd, before\ntransforming into the epic\nfrenzied instrumental\nfor which Slowdive are\nknown best.\nIn short, Slowdive have\ndone exactly what they\nhoped to do. The music\nfelt reinvigorated, and\nmany fans were treated\nto a concert they never\nimagined they\u2019d see.\nThey have achieved what\nso many artists fail to\ndo upon reunion \u2013 they\nweren\u2019t just as good as\nthey were before, they\nwere even better.\nMUSIC\nAndy Djaba\nMusic Editor\nMUSIC\nHannah Cudmore\nMusic Writer\nJ.

With a new, self-ti-tled record out earlier\nthis year, they\u2019ve gone\non tour to crowds far\nbigger than they ever saw\nin the nineties. Opening\ntheir concert at Camden\u2019s\nfamed Roundhouse with\n\u2018Slomo\u2019, the first song\nof the new album, it was\nimmediately apparent that\nthis was no half-baked\nreunion tour. This was not\nto be a night of rehashing\nold favourites for the\nsuper-fans; this was fresh,\n\u201cAcoustic dirge\n\u2018Dagger\u2019left\nmany visibly\nmoved to\ntears\u201d\nwas truer still of acoustic\ndirge \u2018Dagger\u2019, which left\nmany visibly moved to\ntears.

But if\nyou haven\u2019t got a string of\nsuccessful glam albums\nand the invention of ambient music under your belt,\nthese can be notoriously\ntricky. This, however\nseems like such an obvious pairing that surely it\ncouldn\u2019t go wrong: two\nlaidback young rockers\nthat have captured a\ngeneration with kooky attitudes and finessed guitar\nwork, uniting to break new\nground.\nAt first, it certainly feels\nmore Kurt than Courtney.\nThere\u2019s disappointingly\nlittle of the energy and\nrawness of Barnett\u2019s\n2015\u2019s Sometimes I Sit and\nThink, and Sometimes I\nJust Sit. Feedback-driven,\nrompingsolosareswapped\nfor an altogether slower,\ndarker, fleshier sound. But\nit\u2019s not a full on Vile-esque\nreverie either; the pair hit\na bizarre middle ground\nthat\u2019s somehow a bit\u2026\nOasis. This is particularly\nnotable on reworked\nold Barnett track \u2018Outta\nthe Woodwork\u2019 and Jen\nCloher (Barnett\u2019s wife)\ncover \u2018Fear is Like a\nForest\u2019.\nThe same is true\nlyrically. Both Barnett\u2019s\nflooring wit and Vile\u2019s\nintrospective musings are\nblunted and blended, and\nthe result is neither one\nthing nor the other. Major\nthemes include writer\u2019s\nblock, touring agonies,\nand differing tastes in\nbreakfast. Top stuff.\nBut this is what\nactually makes the\nalbum so appealing. The\nwhole LP is a dialogue,\na pally chatter, between\ntwo artists \u2013 actually,\nscrap that \u2013 two friends.\nThoughts and feelings are\nthrown back and forth in\nthe form of soothing riffs\nand monotone call and\nresponse. It\u2019s honest and\nintimate, cosy and whole-some. And as flies on the\nwall, we\u2019re invited to join\nthe conversation. Though\nit may not be quite as large\nas the sum of their parts,\nboth are hugely comfortable with what they\u2019re\ndoing. They\u2019ve very\nlittle to prove and they\u2019re\nhaving fun not proving it.\nW\nriting a\nfollow up\nto 2014\u2019s\ng a rg a n t u -an, Grammy-winning,\nself-titled album was\nnever going to be an easy\ntask for Annie Clark, so\nperhaps that\u2019s why it took\nso long to do. Mind you,\nwhen you\u2019re being hailed\nas the modern day Ziggy\nStardust, you want to\nmake sure you get things\nright. St. Vincent\u2019s first\nmajor release in 3 years\nis an infallibly solid,\ninstantly catchy, art-pop\nclassic \u2013 but it feels maybe\na bit too familiar.\nThere\u2019s a distinctly\npoppy glaze on the\nfirst side, Clark\u2019s much\nloved screeching guitars\nswapped ever increasingly\noften in favour of crisp\nsynths and punchy drum\nmachines. It\u2019s fun and feel-good. Or at least at first\nglance. Lyrically, themes\nare dark and desolate;\naddiction, depression, and\nloss. Second track and\npre-album single \u2018Pills\u2019,\nfor example, is a satanic\nadvertising jingle for a\ndrug-dependent lifestyle,\nyet could be mistaken\nfor an electrified nursery\nrhyme.\nFive tracks in, however,\nthings take a turn and\nemotions are laid bare. A\nbrooding, sinister sound\nintroduces \u2018Los Ageless\u2019,\nbefore breaking down into\nanguished cries of \u201cHow\ncould anybody have you\nand lose you / and not\nlose their minds too?\u201d,\nand then, after a spiralling\ninstrumental, a chilling\nspoken word outro (\u201cI try\nto write you a love song,\nbut it comes out a lament\u201d)\nrepeated over and over as\na desperate mantra.\nStandout track \u2018Happy\nBirthday, Johnny\u2019 comes\nin the form of a letter to an\nestranged friend or lover,\nwho we can only assume\nto be the same as the\nprevious album\u2019s \u2018Prince\nJohnny\u2019. With sparse\nbacking, Clark unsuccessfully tries to reminisce,\ninstead lingering over his\nbattles with substances,\nhomelessness, and crime.\nAnd though she blames\nherself, she feels no longer\nable to help him.\nThe LP covers all bases,\nwith no easily identifiable\nlow points. It\u2019s rough and\ngnarly, it\u2019s sexy and asser-tive, it\u2019s coy and tender,\nit\u2019s\u2026 exactly what we\u2019d\nexpect from St. Vincent,\nbut it\u2019s nothing especially\nnew. She\u2019s certainly found\nher groove, but perhaps\nshe\u2019s a bit too comfortable\nin it.\nGuy Bourdin eat your heart out // Loma Vista\nJamming out over continental breakfasts // Matador\nMUSIC\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nArtist: Courtney Barnett and\nKurt Vile.

Your representatives need you to get involved,\nand come to them with your views \u2013 otherwise nothing will change.\nCOMMENT\nMichael Edwards\nRCSU President\nT\noday marks\nthe end of this\nyear\u2019s Autumn\nElections. For\nmany of you this will have\nbeen your first Imperial\nCollege Union election,\nand it\u2019s been a brilliant\none all round: many of our\nrepresentative positions, in\nparticular within the Royal\nCollege of Science Union\n(RCSU) departments,\nwere heavily contested;\nour Council elections have\nbeen the most contested in\n\u2018living memory\u2019, attracting 49 candidates for 16\nseats on the Union\u2019s top\ndemocratic decision-mak-ing board. Congratulations\nto those of you who have\nwon positions, and thanks\nto all who took part in the\nprocess this time round.\nBut this isn\u2019t the end\nof your chance to have\na say in what goes on at\nImperial. Far from it \u2013 this\nis the beginning.\nWith the newly-elected\nrepresentatives the Union\ncan now turn its full attention into representing\nour views \u2013 the views of\nthe students at College\n\u2013 at important College\nmeetings, such as departmental and Faculty level\nstaff-student committees\nand liaison groups. Rather\nthan switching off after\nyet another election, this is\nthe time where you should\nremain critically engaged.\nImperial students are\nknown for being apathet-ic. In the past we haven\u2019t\nraised our heads when\nour courses are changed\nagainst our best interests,\nand we\u2019ve accepted poor\npastoral care and academic\nteaching. We see ourselves\nas customers of a rigidly\npre-defined educational\nproduct that is set in stone\nand cannot be changed: a\nstepping stone on the way\nto a cosy job in Canary\nWharf or the Square\nMile. It\u2019s something that\nhas been forced on us by\nsociety by the increase in\ntuition fees and other government policy affecting\nuniversities. College, with\nits increasingly corporate\nattitude, certainly isn\u2019t\nhelping.\nWe\u2019re seeing all parts\nof our community, staff,\nand students, calling out\npoorly-made decisions\nby opaque divisions in\nSherfield. In meetings\nwith senior departmental\nand Faculty staff, we often\nfind ourselves on the same\npage with the people we\nrepresent your views to.\nThey\u2019re just as confounded at the poor response\nand engagement as we are,\nand are willing to make\nsweeping and positive\nchanges. They just need\nto know what changes we\nwant them to make.\nYour Academic and\nWellbeing representatives\nare the conduit between\nyou and your Departmental staff, the people\nwho you have chosen to\nbe the trusted voices of\nyour cohort. Their views\nand their complaints will\nbe taken seriously, and\nanything they raise in\nan official forum will be\nconsidered and dealt with.\nHowever, they need to\nknow about the issues and\nproblems that you face in\nyour course so that they\ncan act. So I issue the\nfollowing call to action.\nWe need a culture\nment. In the aftermath of\nthis election season, make\nsure to find out who your\nYear and Department\nRepresentative are. Try\nand identify them, and introduce yourself to them.\nWhenever you have an\nissue with coursework or a\nlecture course, bring it up\nwith them \u2013 it\u2019s likely that\nother people will have the\nsame issue, and your rep\nis just waiting for enough\nevidence to act. Never\nassume that someone else\nwill complain for you \u2013\nalways stand up and point\nout where something feels\nlikeitcouldbemadebetter.\nIt\u2019s not just on us though:\nacademic staff need to\nsee us as partners in our\nlearning and the wider\n\u2018Imperial experience\u2019\nrather than adversaries or\nwhiny children. We know\nhow best we learn, and\nby banding together and\nvoicing what we think, we\ncan effect change for the\nbetter.\nWe need to remember\nthat democracy isn\u2019t just\nvoting every now and then\nfor our representatives and\ndelegating all responsibility to them. Democracy\nis being able to continue\nhaving your own voice\nheard after you\u2019ve left the\npolling booth. My goal for\nthis year is to expand and\nbroaden democracy within\nthe Faculty of Natural\nSciences by upholding\nthis principle and ensuring\nyou can continuously\nand effectively have your\nvoice heard through your\nrepresentatives, and I call\nupon the other Constituent\nUnions \u2013 and you, the\nstudent body \u2013 to join us\nin our endeavour to truly\nmake Imperial College\nUnion the most democratic Student\u2019s Union in the\nUK.\n\u201cAll together now \u2013 3, 2, 1, we love democracy!\u201d// Imperial College Union\n\u201cIn the past,\nwe haven\u2019t\nraised our\nheads when\nour courses\nare changed\nagainst our\nbest interests,\nand have\naccepted poor\npastoral care\u201d\nchange here at Imperial.\nWe all need to become\nmore active participants\nin our own learning,\ncelebrating the best in\neducational practice and\ncalling out poor practice\nthat is in need of improve\u201cWe need to\nremember that\ndemocracy\nisn\u2019t just\nvoting now\nand then, and\ndelegating all\nresponsibility\u201d\n\n"

Travel Editor\nEdita Pileckyte uses her experiences in California to\noffer some advice on exploring the Golden State.\nTRAVEL\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nA\nfter a draining year at\nImperial, and\nquite possibly\nan internship-packed\nsummer, most of us crave\na vacation, preferably\noutside London. While\ncoming back home is\noften enjoyable, going\nsomewhere completely\nnew can be even more ap-pealing. One of the most\npopular travel destinations\nis the United States, which\nhas so much to offer for\ntourists, from majestic\nbusy cities to fascinating\nnatural wonders. If you\u2019ve\nnever visited the US, you\nmight have heard it\u2019s very\nlarge, but make no mistake\n\u2013 it\u2019s actually even bigger\nthan you think! I spent\n2 weeks in California,\nwith a short detour to Las\nVegas, and it still wasn\u2019t\nenough. To fully explore\nthe magnificence of even\na small part of the country\nrequires a lot of time\nand \u2013 you\u2019ve guessed it\n\u2013 money! The good news\nis that nowadays it\u2019s more\nthan possible to travel on\na budget, so here are some\ntips based on my first-hand\nexperience.\nACCOMMODATION\nWhile it\u2019s possible to\nfind an affordable Airbnb\nor hostel, it\u2019s even better\nto crash on someone\u2019s\ncouch for free, which\nleaves you more money\nfor actual travelling. If\nyou don\u2019t know anyone\nyou could stay with, don\u2019t\nstress \u2013 you can always\nopt for Couchsurfing,\na website offering free\naccommodation for travellers all around the world.\nYes, it does sound dodgy\nat first, but it\u2019s completely\nlegit and has helped many\nyoung travellers, including myself. Surprisingly,\nthe place I stayed at in Los\nAngeles happened to be\nvery fancy, comfortable,\nand arguably better than\nany hostel. Our host even\ngave us a lift to and from\nthe closest underground\nstation every day as well\nas sharing his food with\nus.\nThat being said, this\ndoesn\u2019t happen all the\ntime \u2013 we were just extremely lucky. However,\nalthough most homes\ndon\u2019t resemble hotels,\nCouchsurfing is still a\ngood way to not only save\nmoney but also meet the\nlocals. For instance, the\nplace we stayed at in Vegas\nthere was an interesting\nand important part of our\ntravelling experience.\nNonetheless, if you opt\nfor Couchsurfing, there\nare several important\nthings to remember:\ncheck the references from\nprevious guests to make\nsure your potential host\nis trustworthy and their\nhome is suitable for you;\nalways be careful, especially if travelling alone;\nas trivial as it sounds, be\npolite and respectful \u2013\nsome travellers feel that\nthey can do whatever they\nplease, like come back\ndrunk at 3am, leave a\ncomplete mess after their\nvisit, or not even bother\ninteracting with their host;\nthough the hosts don\u2019t\nexpect any money for your\nstay, a good thank you gift\ncould be cooking them a\nmeal, sending a postcard\nfrom your home country,\nor even just spending\nsome time chatting and\ngetting to know them; start\nsending requests early \u2013\nyou\u2019ll likely get rejected\na lot since the best places\nare also the most popular\nones, so don\u2019t leave it to\nthe last minute; and finally\nask your friends to leave\nreferences for you about\ntheir experience staying\nat your place \u2013 this will\ncomplete your profile and\nhosts will be more likely\nto trust you.\nTRANSPORT WITHIN\nCITIES\nYou may have heard\nalready that the best way\nof getting around the US is\nby car. Unfortunately, we\ndidn\u2019t have one and ended\nup getting around by\npublic transport and Uber.\nTo our surprise, we didn\u2019t\nexperience many problems\nwith the infamous LA\ntraffic: going places did\ntake quite a bit of time but\nno more than you\u2019d expect\nfrom such a large city.\nThe underground system\nin LA isn\u2019t as popular as\nin London: the trains run\nevery 20 minutes only and\ndon\u2019t serve the whole city.\nBut it also has some perks\n\u2013 it\u2019s not as crowded as the\nTube and costs just under\n$2 one way.\nIn contrast, Vegas\ndoesn\u2019t have an underground system as it\u2019s a\nmuch smaller city in the\nmiddle of a desert. But\nyou can get around by\nbuses ($8 for 24h) or Uber\n(around $23 for 25min\nride). If you\u2019re travelling\non a budget, you\u2019ll most\ndefinitely live far away\nfrom the Strip \u2013 the main\nstreet with expensive\nhotels \u2013 where all the\nParched trees litter the desert in Death Valley // Edita Pileckyte\nPalm trees in balmy Malibu // Edita Pileckyte\n\u201cCouchsurfing\nis completely\nlegit, and\nhas helped\nmany young\ntravellers,\nincluding\nmyself\u201d\nwasn\u2019t nearly as fancy or\ntidy as our LA accommo-dation, but we were still\ngiven comfortable sofas\nwith clean bedding and\ntowels, and our host also\nshared his food with us\nand picked us up from the\nbus station. Plus, getting\nto know him and other\ncouchsurfers who stayed\nthe most of the Golden State with limited funds\n\u201cIf you want\nto make the\nmost out of the\nWest Coast in a\nsingle trip, opt\nfor a rental car\u201d\nactivities take place. So\nUbering to and from the\nStrip every day is the most\nconvenient option but it\u2019ll\ncost you a fortune. The\ngood news is \u2013 one day\nis enough to look around\nVegas, so a couple of taxi\nrides should be affordable.\nOtherwise, if you opt for\na rental car, there are a\nfew hotels that offer free\nparking even for non-guests.\nour bank accounts quite\na bit, though I\u2019d say it\u2019s\nstill cheaper than renting\nan Airbnb in SF (unless\nyou\u2019re lucky enough\nto find something on\nCouchsurfing). However,\ntravelling outside the bay\narea for the scenic views\nof Yosemite National\nPark or Big Sur is next to\nimpossible without a car:\nyou\u2019d spend the whole day\non public transport, which\nis expensive and requires\nat least 3 transfers!\nSo if you want to make\nthe most of the West Coast\nin a single trip, opt for\na rental car. It\u2019s usually\ncheaper as well, especially\nif you travel in a group\nand share the expenses.\nIf you can\u2019t drive, public\ntransport is a good-enough\noption to explore the cities,\nthough it won\u2019t allow you\nto sightsee much outside\nof them.\nTRANSPORT OUTSIDE\nCITIES\nTo reiterate, renting a\ncar is probably the best\noption, which will allow\nyou to explore the wonderful West Coast in your\nown time. For example,\nyou could drive from LA\nto SF along the scenic\nState Route 1, making\nstops at mesmerizing\nbeaches to enjoy sunshine\nand the ocean, and reach\na golden state of mind.\nYou can pick up and\nreturn the car in different\ncities, which makes things\neven easier. You can also\ntravel by Megabus \u2013 if\nyou book your tickets\nwell in advance, you can\nget a bargain for $1 one\nway. Alternatively, you\ncan choose a domestic\nflight, which usually are\n(relatively) affordable and\nquick.\nMoreover, a trip to\nCalifornia would not be\ncomplete without visiting\nthe national parks, such as\nDeath Valley, Yosemite, or\nGrand Canyon. Of course,\nas you may have guessed,\nthey are quite far away\nfrom the main cities (2-4h\ndrive). So if you decide to\ntravel such a distance, it\u2019s\nbest to spend at least two\ndays there so you can hike\nand explore the places at\nyour own pace. Plus, park\nentrance fees ($20-30 for\n7 days) are charged per\nvehicle so splitting the\ncost between a group of\ntravellers offers a very\naffordable trip. Alternatively, you can book 1-day\nbus tours but they are\nquite pricey (e.g. around\n$200 per person for Death\nValley) and don\u2019t give you\nenough time to explore\nNatural beauty is only enhanced by saving lots of dough! // Edita Pileckyte\nFinally, our last stop,\nSan Francisco, was one\nhell of an expensive city,\nthe second priciest area in\nthe States after Manhattan,\naccording to the locals.\nWe happened to stay in\nAlbany, a city separated\nfrom SF by Berkeley and\nOakland, and spent at least\nan hour on the (very fast!)\ntrain every day to reach the\nSF centre. One-way tickets\nrange from $5 to $10,\nwhich naturally drained\nthe area. Having said that,\ntravelling with a guide is\nprobably safer since they\ntake you to tourist-friendly\nplaces and you don\u2019t have\nto worry about things like\ncars breaking down or\ngetting lost. So if you opt\nto drive by yourself, find\nout the safest way to travel\naround and be prepared,\ne.g. take plenty of water\nand wear appropriate\nclothes.\nFinally, the most expensive part of long-distance\ntrips is usually flight\ntickets but luckily there\nare a few budget airlines\noffering transfer between\nthe US and Europe for as\nlittle as $400 both ways.\nThey don\u2019t provide meals\nand allow limited baggage,\nbut are still a good way to\nsave money. For instance,\nNorwegian Airlines offer\ndirect flights, 2 hand\nluggage pieces, and an\non-board entertainment\nsystem with films and TV\nshows. Another affordable\noption is WOW Airlines,\nthough they don\u2019t offer\ndirect flights or in-flight\nentertainment, so be sure\nto bring a book on board!\nFOOD\nIf you\u2019re travelling on\na budget, you\u2019ll probably\ngo for food from grocery\nstores rather than res-taurants. However, the\ncheapest food might be full\nof sugar and preservatives,\nso if you want something\nhealthier, you can shop at\nTrader Joe\u2019s, which sells\norganic products and is a\ncheaper version of Whole\nFoods. The famous Target\nalso offers reasonable\nprices but anything from\n7-eleven will cost you an\narm and a leg. If you get\nhungry while sightseeing,\nthere\u2019s a McDonalds or\nSubway literally on every\ncorner. A bit more expensive but still affordable\noption is In-N-Out Burger,\na chain based in California\nonly and thus an integral\npart of your West Coast\nexperience. Their food\nis delicious, and you can\norder something from\ntheir secret online menu\nif you want to dine like a\nlocal!\n\u201cIn-N-Out\nBurger is based\nin California,\nso as well\nas being\naffordable,\nit\u2019s an integral\npart of your\nWest Coast\nexperience\u201d\n\u2018Siri, play the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme\u201d // Edita Pileckyte\n\n"

The\nsocial democratic party\n(SP\u00d6) under Christian\nKern came second with\n26.9%, just ahead of the\nright-wing nationalist freedom party (FP\u00d6), which\ngot 26.0% (an increase\nof 5.5%). The neoliberal\nNEOS came fourth with\n5.2%, followed by Liste\nPilz with 4.4%. The Green\nParty came last with only\n3.8% (down 8.7%).\nThe success of the \u00d6VP\ncomes as no surprise.\nKurz, who took over the\n\u00d6VP from Reinhold Mitterlehner in spring, used\nrecent political instability\nto his advantage. With\nhis radical revamp of the\ndusty, old \u00d6VP he attracted voters from both sides\nof the political spectrum\nand mobilised non-vot-ers. Two years after he\nbegan gaining popularity,\n31-year-old Kurz is set\nto become the world\u2019s\nyoungest government\nleader. In his first public\nstatement after the election\nhe said he \u201chas been given\na great responsibility\u201d and\nthat he \u201cwants to establish\na new political style\u201d.\nAnother winner was\nthe FP\u00d6 under Heinz\nChristian Strache. It is\n\u201cThe success\nof the rightwing \u00d6VP, who\nincreased their\nvote share by\n7.6%, comes as\nno surprise\u201d\n\u201cThe future\nof the Green\nParty is\nuncertain: if\nthey fail to\nreach 4% of\nthe vote share\nthey will lose\ntheir seats\u201d\nthe best result for the\nparty since right-wing\npopulist J\u00f6rg Haider led\nthe party to second place\nin parliamentary elections\nin 1999, and the second\nbest since 1945. With\npopulist slogans like \u201cSafe\nborders, safe homeland!\u201d\nand \u201cAustria deserves\nfairness!\u201d the FP\u00d6 was\nparticularly successful in\nrural areas and won over\nthe working class, which\nPresident, subsequent\nchaos and poor leadership\nrepelled voters (see our\ncoverage in Felix 1671).\nMembers of the Green\nParty also blame their\ndefeat on the loss of Peter\nPilz. After being removed\nfrom the Green Party\u2019s list\nof parliamentary candi-dates, Pilz ran for government with Liste Pilz, his\nnewly formed party. Pilz\ntold Austrian newspaper\nProfil: \u201cThe Green Party\nhave a new beginning\nand a phase of renewal\nahead of them. They are\nentirely responsible for\nthemselves.\u201d\nAt the time of writing,\nwith 3.9% of votes yet\nto be counted, the future\nof the Green Party is\nuncertain. If they fail to\nincrease their vote share\nto 4% they will lose\ntheir place in parliament.\nThe majority of people\nworking for the Green\nParty on a federal level\nwould be dismissed and\nthe party would lose \u20ac8.2\nmillion of funding. Green\nParty candidate Updike\nLunacek said: \u201cThis is the\nworst crisis of the Green\nmovement in Austria since\nits founding.\u201d\nWho will form the\nnext government is still\nan open question. Strache\nis hungry for power and\nwants to see his party in\nthe government. The odds\non a far-right coalition\nbetween the \u00d6VP and\nFP\u00d6 are good. The parties\nbecame considerably\ncloser on the campaign\ntrail and frequently agree\non policy.\nThe SP\u00d6, meanwhile, is\nsplit into two wings. One\nfavours a coalition with\nthe FP\u00d6, while the other,\nled by influential mayor of\nVienna Michael H\u00e4upl, is\nstrictly against talks with\nthe \u00d6VP. In any case it\nwould be hard to justify\nanother coalition between\n\u00d6VP and SP\u00d6, since this\ncombination has been\nproven to be dysfunctional\nmore than once and has\nbeen the main reason for\nearly re-elections this year.\nAt the moment all signs\npoint to the nightmare of\nmany people on the left\nin Austria: a right-wing\ncoalition between \u00d6VP\nand FP\u00d6.\n\u00d6VP is a huge step closer to taking control of the Austrian government // Wikimedia\nThose on the left\nin Austria are left\ndissapointed as a\nright-wing coalition\nseems likely.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nGR\u00dcNE\nPILZ\nNEOS\nFP\u00d6\nSP\u00d6\n\u00d6VP\n31.5%\n+7.5%\n(%)\n26.9%\n+0.1%\n26%\n+5.5%\n5.3%\n+0.3%\n4.4%\n+4.4%\n3.8%\n-8.6%\nabove all Sebastian\nKurz and his conservative \u00d6sterreichische\nVolkspartei (\u00d6VP) with\n\u201cWith slogans\nlike\u2018Austria\ndeserves\nfairness!\u2019the\nFP\u00d6 won over\nthe working\nclass, who\nusually vote\nfor the social\ndemocrats\u201d\ntypically votes for the\nsocial democrats.\nDespite the Green\nParty\u2019s successful start to\nthe year, which saw former\nparty leader Alexander\nVan der Bellen elected\nYeah, Felix makes graphs now.

The\ndisconcerting quality of\nsuch incongruousness\nand its \u2018othering\u2019 effect\nare amongst the several\nways of \u2018be-monstering\u2019\nexplored in the poetry\nworkshop led by Vahni\nCapildeo last weekend,\nwhose latest collection\nMeasures of Expatriation\nwon the Forward Prize for\nBest Collection in 2016.\nOne example we\nexamined in the workshop\nwas Francis Ponge\u2019s\nFaune et Flore (from Le\nParti Pris des Choses),\nin which the flora are\nlikewise \u2018be-monstered\u2019\nthrough estrangement:\nmuch of their character-isation draws on their\nlack of human qualities\n(\u201cAucun geste, aucune\npens\u00e9e, peut-\u00eatre aucun\nd\u00e9sir, aucune intention\u201d\n\u2013 \u2018no gesture, no thought,\nperhaps no desire, no\nintention\u2019), whose \u2018otherness\u2019 is reinforced by the\nextensive use of anaphoric\nsentences beginning with\n\u201cils\u201d (they). Indeed the\nword \u2018monster\u2019 itself \u2013\nderived from the Latin\nmonere, \u2018to warn\u2019 \u2013 etymologically referred to\nmalformed creatures so\nstrange and otherworldly\nin appearance that they\ncame to be seen as portentous of divine \u2018warning\u2019.\nEstrangement on the\nlevel of language itself\nalso comes into play here,\nfor example in Ponge\u2019s\nneologistic use of \u201cexcroissance\u201d (outgrowth).\nThis, as is the case with\nany \u2018be-monstering\u2019 of\nthe artistic medium itself,\nruns the risk of alienating\nthe reader altogether.\nAn estranged lexicon\ncould as much intensify\nas obscure meaning, and\nleave us puzzled with, to\nsteal a phrase from Wilde,\n\u201cthe rage of Caliban not\nseeing his own face in a\nglass\u201d. Analogously we\nfind in modern theatre the\ndilemmas associated with\nthe use of Verfremdungseffekts \u2013 Bertoldt Brecht\u2019s\nmethod of distancing the\naudience from characters.\nEqually if not more\nunsettling in Faune is the\ndescription of \u201cirr\u00e9m\u00e9diable\u201d, uncontrollable\ngrowth, which became\nthe focus of our discussion of monstrosity in\nnature: starfish fissioning,\nzombies, cancer. In par-ticular, the multiplication\nand replication of things\nin large numbers and the\nmetamorphosis of single\nbeings can seem particularly uncanny. This leads\nus naturally to the territory of \u2018be-monstering\u2019\nthrough the exploitation of\nour inherent ambivalence\ntowards identity and\nself-awareness.\nTo recall the etymology\nof \u2018monster\u2019, there is\nsomething self-referential\nabout our tendency to\nview the strangeness\nperceived in others as a\nsinister reflection on our\nown prospects. Whilst the\nreplication and metamorphosis of single beings and\nthe numerosity of similar\nbeings invoke our fear,\nboth of a loss of identity\nand of the awareness of\nourselves as distinct living\nbeings, the capacity for\nshape-changing is furthermore reminiscent of our\ndeformability, vulnerability and, as Capildeo noted,\nedibility: it is, to quote\nWilde again, Caliban\u2019s\nrage upon seeing his re-flection. Not least for this\nreason does an animal\u2019s\neating of another animal\noften \u2018be-monster\u2019them in\nour eyes. A more extreme\nexample is our horror\nof cannibalism, widely\nregarded as the epitome\nof monstrosity, symbolic\nboth of our effaceability\nand of our capacity for\nself-effacement, and\nhence of a double loss of\nidentity.\nIf Freud is right about\nthe universality of primary\nnarcissism, then, it would\nnot perhaps \u2018be-monster\u2019\nthis article to end with\nTiresias\u2019 cryptic comment\non Narcissus: that he\nwill live long, \u201csi se non\nnoverit\u201d (\u2018if he does not\nlearn to know himself\u2019).\nBOOKS\nAstrid Zong\nBooks Writer\nVahni Capildeo, winner of last year\u2019s Forward Prize in poetry // Southbank Centre\nAspartoftheLondonLiteratureFestival,theSouthbankCentreisrunningaseriesofworkshopsonwriting,including\nthis one on the idea of \u2018be-monstering\u2019 in poetry.\nin History of Wolves\nintrigued her, and was so\ncompelling that she could\nsee herself expanding it\ninto a full-length novel.\nFridlund had researched\nice, fishing, and almost\nevery detail of the Minnesotan landscape that plays\ninto her character\u2019s voice.\nSimilarly, the family in\nFiona Mozley\u2019s Elmet is\nintimately connected with\nthe Yorkshire landscape\ntheyhavemadetheirhome,\nand her novel is a response\nto her generation\u2019s \u201cfrustrated relationship with\nland\u201d. A PhD student who\nworks part-time in an\nindependent bookshop,\nMozley felt that her generation can \u201cnever be secure\nin our homes\u201d, because\nof the fluctuating value\nof property, especially in\ncities like London. It is\nespecially hard for young\nwriters and artists to gain\nsecurity, she felt, and that\nis going to impoverish this\ncity.\nThe running theme of\nthe shortlisted books was\nusing art and storytelling\nas a response to current\nand historical issues.\nElmet represented the\nvoice of a young generation frustrated with the\ndifficulties of settling\ndown in a land that one\ncan call one\u2019s own, with\nthe security of a physical\nspace to call home so out\nof reach. On the other\nhand, Ali Smith\u2019s Autumn\nwas an experiment in\nwriting about issues so\nraw and current things are\nstill going on as the book\nreaches the bookshelf.\nDubbed the \u2018Brexit novel\u2019,\nAutumn tackles immigra-tion, xenophobia, identity,\nand the backlash to the\nincreasing movement of\npeople and ideas. Mohsin\nHadid\u2019s Exit West brings\nthe harsh realities of\nforced migration into\nsharp focus by following\nindividual people caught\nin the conflict \u2013 real\npeople with concerns\nand relationships that are\nlike our own, but, unlike\nus, have their values and\nrelationships challenged\nby their situation.\nIn times of difficulty,\nfrivolous pursuits with\nno practical value. This\nyear\u2019s shortlist shows\nthat anger and a desire for\nchange can be channelled\ninto creative works that\nbring issues into sharper\nfocus and introduce different perspectives on the\nsame situation. Literature\nis a political tool and a\nparticipant in the dialogue\nof current affairs, but\nveiled in the beauty of\nlanguage. These books are\na testament to the power\nof words and the value of\nimagination.\nThis event was part\nof the London Literature\nFestival at London\u2019s\nSouthbank Centre.\n\u201cAli Smith\u2019s\nAutumn was an\nexperiment in\nwriting about\nissues so raw\nthat things are\nstill going on\nas the book\nreaches the\nbookshelf\u201d\n\u201cMohsin\nHadid\u2019s Exit\nWest brings the\nharsh realities\nof forced\nmigration into\nsharp focus\u201d\nthe value of art and literature is often questioned,\nrelegated to the realm of\nAn evening discussion with the Booker Prize nominees\nThe six shortlisted authors sat down the night before the\nwinner was revealed to read from their novels, answer\nquestions from the audience, and give their thoughts on\nthe future of literature.\nBOOKS\nJingjie Cheng\nBooks Editor\n\u201cFiona Mozley,\nthe author of\nElmet, called\nher book a\nWestern with\nsomething\nelse\u201d\nI\nt was the night before\nthe announcement\nof the 2017 Man\nBooker Prize winner,\nand it was the first time\nthe shortlisted writers had\nall come together in the\nsame space. In the Royal\nFestival Hall, where all six\nshortlisted writers sat next\nto each other on stage, the\nanticipation was palpable\namid the celebratory\natmosphere. There was a\ncollective feeling of awe\namong the audience, of\npassion and sincerity emanating from stage, and a\ngeneral sense of wonder at\nthe power of words.\nThree had flown in from\nAmerica, one was born in\nLahore. Two were here\nto read from their debut\nnovels. Two were from\nthe UK \u2013 one English, one\nScottish. One was doing\nher PhD and worked part-time in an independent\nAll the books harboured\nthemes of displacement\nand loss, whether in time,\nspace, or memory. For the\nfirst time, the writers all\nmet each other and stood\nin the dressing room, discussing their works before\ngoing on stage. Any could\nwin the Man Booker this\nyear.\nOfcourse,wenowknow\nthat George Saunders won\nthe Man Booker 2017 with\nhis first novel Lincoln in\nthe Bardo, inspired by\nthe story that Abraham\nLincoln had gone to the\ngrave of his favourite son\nin grief after he died, to\nsomehow interact with\nhis body. Drawing from\nthe idea of the \u2018bardo\u2019\nin Tibetan Buddhism as\nthe intermediary space\nbetween life and death,\nSaunders\u2019 story is narrated\nby a chorus of 166 ghosts\nthat Lincoln and his son\nencounter while there. Its\ninteresting structure and\nnarration was a constant\npoint of discussion regarding the book, and was the\nresult of Saunders\u2019attempt\nto give a more omniscient\nrelaying of the story, rather\nthan have either protagonist or the gravedigger\nnarrate the story.\nIndeed, throughout the\nreadings and discussion\nof the evening the idea of\n\u2018genre\u2019 was apparent. One\naudience member asked\nduring the Q&A: have\nwe exhausted all genres\n\u2013 science fiction, fantasy,\nhistorical? If you (the\nauthors) were to create\nan entirely new genre,\nwhat would it be? Fiona\nMozley, author of Elmet,\njumped in to reply. Of all\nthe shortlisted works, she\nsaid, it seems that hers was\nthe \u201cleast experimental of\nform\u201d; however, she saw\nit as a study in genre. It is\na Western with something\nelse, she said \u2013 her novel\nhas an archetypal masculine character, but in\nthis case, undercut by his\nteenage daughter. Characters in her book have\n\u201cbodies and behaviours\nthat are not quite real\u201d,\nand hence carry elements\nof fantasy.\nSaunders, in reply to\nthe same question, noted\nthat if one starts out\nwith a mission to create\nsomething new, it was not\ngoing to happen. Original\nforms and genres come\nabout when you have\nsomething to say, but are\nfrustrated with the limitations of existing forms,\nhe said. The unique form\nof Lincoln in the Bardo\ncertainly seems to be an\nanswer to the shortcomings of more conventional\nforms.\nThis year\u2019s shortlist is\nan interesting mix \u2013 the\nnovels on the list seem\nto be pushing the boundaries of fiction, being\nexperimental with form,\nstructure, and themes.\nAlison Flood of The\nGuardian analysed all the\npast winners of the Booker\nprize and concluded that\nthe average winner was a\nprivately-educated white\nEnglish man in his late 40s\nwho has written a book of\nless than 400 pages with a\nmale protagonist, usually\nhis seventh. This year\u2019s\nshortlist consists of three\nwomen, two of whom\nare debut novelists (one\nAmerican), a man of Pakistani origin, a book that\nis a whopping 880 pages\n(hardcover), and another\nAmerican short-sto-ry-writer-turned-novelist.\nBoth 4321 and Lincoln in\nthe Bardo deal with historical events and real characters from history, while\nExit West and Autumn deal\nwith very current issues of\nmigration and belonging.\nIn History of Wolves and\nElmet, landscape and\nsetting become important\nelements and are intricately related to characters and\ntheme.\nThe authors took turns\nto read an extract from\ntheir book, and then\nchatted with the host\nabout it, followed by a\nQ&A session open to the\nfloor. When asked if his\nbook was meant for the\ntheatres, Saunders replied,\n\u201cdefinitely\u201d, and that\nthey had already sold the\nmovie rights. With the 166\ndifferent voices, the story\ncertainly lends itself well\nto a dramatic interpreta-tion. In fact, an audiobook\nis already out, with 166\nunique individuals voicing\nthe ghosts, including the\nlikes of Ben Stiller and\nJulianne Moore, Saunders\nhimself, and \u2013 when he ran\nout of people to ask \u2013 he\neven roped in his family\nmembers to voice the\ncharacters.\nOn the other hand, when\nasked about the possibility\nof a movie from 4321,\nAuster laughed and said\nthat his novel was \u201cmovie-proof\u201d. 4321 follows\nfour alternate lives of the\nsame character, and the\nhost had asked him which\nof the four lives would be\na focus should a movie be\nmade out of it. All four\nare equally important,\nAuster replied, and hence\nit would be impossible to\nmake it into a film of less\nthan three hours. Despite\nthat, he added, it was \u201ca\nvery stripped-down book\u201d\n\u2013 much to the audience\u2019s\namusement.\nEmily Fridlund, like\nSaunders, started off as a\nshort story writer and her\nHistory of Wolves started\nout as a short story. The\ndifference between a short\nstory and a novel, she said,\nwas that one \u201chad to stay\ninterested in the character\nin a novel\u201d.

This week, Imperial\nwas keen to avoid a similar situation and prove\nto the league that a fresh\nImperial side was here to\ncompete.\nWith the return of many\nplayers from injuries,\nnotably Club Captain\nToby \u201cthe sling\u201d Simpson,\nour first team looked more\nthan ready to do exactly\nthat. Fortress Harlington\nwas blessed with its ideal\nplaying conditions: slight\ndrizzle and 20 mph winds\nfor the boys. First half with\nthe wind in their faces,\nImperial conceded a quick\ntry within 5 minutes of\nplay after sloppy handling\nand defence. However,\nthe boys quickly regained\ntheir cool and worked\ntheir way up to field,\nputting pressure on the\nReading defence to finally\nforce a penalty in front\nof the posts, perfectly\nconverted by small wave\nsurfer James Field. On the\nensuing restart however,\nthe 6ft6 Toby tower\ntumbled onto his spare\nshoulder and was ruled out\nof the game. Quick substitution and sloppy hands\nensued, eventually leading\nto another silly try from\nsneaky Reading. During\nthis time, crystal expert\nAli Zed was subjected to a\nnice knee to the face and\nwas consequently escorted\nto the bench, leaving\nImperial without two of its\nmain starters. However,\nin similar fashion to the\nprevious time, Imperial\ngained terrain and once\nagain converted a well-earned penalty right on\nhalf time.\nWith the wind in their\nbacks, the second half\nlooked more promising\nfor the boys. Quick attacks\nand good play gave the\nupper hand to Imperial\nat the start of the half but\nthey struggled to cash in.\nA potential breakthrough\nalmost occurred when\nresident gimp Marin\nTuleu flew through the\nair to catch a high ball in\nthe opposing 22. Upon an\nalmost perfect reception,\nthe man decides to drop\nthe ball in front of him as\nhe approached the try line.\nWhat could have caused\nthis? Pressure? Marital\nproblems? The mystery\nremains intact, and Marin\nremains dick of the day.\nLuckily, solid big boy\ncarries by every fresher\u2019s\nidol Ben Jones gave\nImperial a chance to put\nmore points on the board\nafter an unfortunate try by\nReading. Despite strong\nwinds, Toby \u201cso much\nbetter than Allingham\u201d\nDaniels hit his line out\nperfectly and the ensuing\nmaul made it past the try\nline for 5 points (convert-ed by surf soc).\nAlthough the comeback\nlooked promising,\nReading eventually ran\naway with the win, scoring\n2 tries in quick succession\nand bringing the game\nto a close.

We would\nalways encourage anyone\nwho has witnessed \u2013 or\nbeen the victim of \u2013 violent\nor abusive behaviour to\nreport it to the police or\na member of Union or\nCollege staff.

This\nincrease can potentially\nbe explained by the larger\nrange and increased\nnumber of roles available.\nThis increase in participation has been seen across\nall faculties: the Faculty of\nMedicine has fielded more\nrunning in the ARN. This\nyearonly183studentshave\nput themselves forward\nfor undergraduate ARN,\ncompared with 242 in last\nyear\u2019s Autumn Elections.\nIt seems likely that this is\ndue to the increase in the\nnumber of representative\npositions in this election\ncycle. Overall, the number\nof candidates for ARN\nand WBRN combined is\nhigher than those who ran\nfor ARN last year.\nSome students Felix\nspoke to expressed concerns about the number\nof candidates running for\npositions in the WBRN:\nwhile 52 positions\nwithin the network have\ncandidates in the election,\nthere are 27 unfilled,\nincluding a number of\nDepartmental Wellbeing Representatives. A\ncouple of departments\nare notable for their lack\nof participants: Physics,\nfor example, has nobody\nrunning for their Departmental Wellbeing Representative, or for their Year\nOne, Two, and Four Wellbeing Representatives.\nOf the positions with no\ncandidates, a disproportionate number are those\nfor third and fourth-year\nstudents.\nSome of the most contested positions were the\nUnion Council Ordinary\nMembers, with 49 students\nrunning for the 16 positions available, up from\n16 candidates last year.\nUndergraduate positions\nwere particularly popular,\nwith 17 students running\nfor the Engineering Ordinary Member (UG) roles,\nfor example.\nOther positions,\nhowever, had candidates\nrunning uncontested. Out\nof the 155 positions with\ncandidates running, 69 of\nthese had single candidates running unopposed.\nTurnout is expected to\nbe higher than last year\u2019s,\nwhich was 14.71%: at the\ntime of writing, 21.15%\nof students had voted,\nincluding 32% of undergraduate students.\nIn a statement to Felix,\na Union representative\nsaid: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to\nsee a record number of\ncandidates in the Autumn\nElections, including three\ntimes as many Council\ncandidates and a 20% increase in people interested\nin our Representation Networks than this time last\nyear.

The summer of\n2017 has been something\nof a graveyard for sequels,\nreboots and franchises,\nand film studios will have\nto reconsider how they\napproach audiences, both\ndomestic and foreign, if\nthey wish to revive the\nspectacle of the summer\nmovie season. Studio\nexecutives could probably\nlearn a few lessons by\npaying attention to some\nof the lower budget films\nthat managed to exceed\nbox office expectations\nthis summer.\nWithout a doubt, the\nmost successful low-budget production of the\nyear will be Jordan Peele\u2019s\nGet Out. The film, which\nfinds horror in casual\nracism, has attracted unanimous praise ever since its\nmid-March release. Critics\nhave lavished it with rave\nreviews and some have\neven penned it for a Best\nPicture nomination as\nHollywood gears up for\nOscar season. And that\u2019s\nnot all: against a $4.5\nmillion budget, the film\nhas pulled in a whopping\n$253.1 million world-wide, meaning that it\nwill probably be the most\nprofitable film of the year.\nSo, how exactly did this\nfilm \u2013 a directorial debut\nfor Peele and starring a\nsemi-notable cast \u2013 wind\nup as one of the bona fide\nhits of 2017?\nFor that, we have to\nturn to its two-pronged\nelements \u2013 a culturally\nrelevant racial commentary mounted against\na backdrop of satirical\nhorror. On the other hand,\nstellar reviews, roughly\n200 pre-release screenings\nand over 6 million trailer\nviews on YouTube, all\nworked in tandem to cultivate favourable word-of-mouth and propel the film\nto a $33.4 million opening\nweekend. The film\u2019s\nbuzz continued well after\nrelease and on its second\nweekend, its ticket sales\nhad dropped only 15.4%\nrelative to its opening\nweekend \u2013 significant,\nbecause horror films generally post second-week-end drops of at least 60%.\nGet Out\u2019s success is\neven more surprising\nbecause it was released\nin February \u2013 one of the\nso-called \u201cdump months\u201d\nwhere audiences are\nsmaller and theatres in\nNorth America typically\nexpect much fewer ticket\nsales. To simply say that\nGet Out \u201cdefies expectations\u201d is a lazy statement,\nbecause the film does so\nmuch more than that. It is a\nfilm that has attracted tons\nof ticket sales and critical\npraise, while seemingly\ndefying every Hollywood\nrule about how movies\nattract tons of ticket sales\nand critical praise. Get\nOut\u2019s unique pattern of\nsuccess was mirrored\nthroughout the summer by\nother low-budget releases\nsuch as Atomic Blonde,\nGirls Trip and Baby\nDriver \u2013 films that didn\u2019t\nhave a war chest to spend\non advertising, but still\nmanaged to draw large\naudiences into theatres by\nrelying on strong reviews\nand social media buzz.\nAtomic Blonde, the\nneon-lit 80s spy thriller\ndirected by David Leitch\n(John Wick), garnered\nfavourable reviews and\npulled in a respectable\n$95.7 million worldwide\nagainst a budget of $30\nmillion, even while\nopening only one week\nafter Christopher Nolan\u2019s\nwar epic, Dunkirk. Girls\nTrip, another sleeper hit,\nbecame the first comedy\nin 2017 to gross over\n$100 million in the North\nAmerican market, and\nso far has topped out at\n$136.3 million worldwide.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that\nwhile Girls Trip has made\nover 84% of its revenue\ndomestically (in the North\nAmerican market), other\nsleeper hits like Baby\nDriver ($226.3 million\nworldwide gross; $34\nmillion budget) and Split\n($278 million worldwide\ngross; $9 million budget)\nhave been able to generate\nalmost equal amounts\nof domestic and foreign\nrevenue.\nGirls Trip\u2019s concentrated popularity in the U.S.\nis not unusual, since its\nstoryline seems heavily\ngeared towards that\nmarket; a phenomenon\nalso mirrored by the\nsuccess of Dunkirk in the\nU.K. While Dunkirk has\nmanaged to pull in $522.9\nmillion worldwide, $73.7\nmillion of that has come\nfrom the combined U.K.\nand Ireland market \u2013 this\nis notable, given that\nthe combined U.K. and\nIreland market generally\ncontributes less than 10%\nto the worldwide revenues\nof most Hollywood\nblockbusters. Dunkirk\u2019s\npopularity in the U.K. has\nmade it the second-highest\ngrossing film at the 2017\nU.K. box office, missing\nout on first place to\nDisney\u2019s Beauty and the\nBeast, which is currently\nthe highest-grossing film\nof the year at the global\nbox office.\nThe success of low-budget films like Get Out\nand Atomic Blonde, as\nwell as market-specific\ntargets like Girls Trip and\nDunkirk, lends credence to\nthe claim that the average\nmoviegoer is beginning\nto care more about novel\nand unique cinematic ex-periences, opposed to the\nlatest Marvel superhero\ninstalment, Paramount\nPictures sequel, or Warner\nBros. remake.\nI could say more about\nthe creeping threat of\nstreaming platforms,\nthe curious success of\nanimated movies, or the\nmoney-making machine\nthat is Marvel Studios,\nbut in doing so, I would\nprobablystretchthisarticle\nby a couple thousand\nwords \u2013 a bit excessive\ngiven that we\u2019re already\nin 2-page territory here.\nNonetheless, these topics\nare indeed important and\nthey provide some unique\ninsights into where the\nfilm and TV industries are\nheaded over the next few\nyears. I will be exploring\nthem in future editions of\nFelix, so stay tuned to read\nabout it. As for now, it\nseems safe to say that with\nthe 2017 summer movie\nseason, we witnessed a\njuxtaposition of fortunes.\nAudiences were treated\nto both high-budget\nblockbusters and low-budget novelties, and will\nundoubtedly be hoping for\nsimilarly varied offerings\nnext year; film studios on\nthe other hand, will likely\nbe revisiting their assumptions about what kinds of\nmovies make money. The\nground is shifting beneath\ntheir feet and a fog is\nobscuring their vision, so\nthey will need to find their\nbearings quickly or risk\nextinction at the hands of a\nfuture box office blunder.\nDunkirk (left), Spiderman: Homecoming (right)\nmarketing campaign. On\nthe one hand, Universal\nStudios\u2019 advertising\nplacements focused on\nthe film\u2019s unique thematic\nFelix Film\u2019s Summer 2017 cinema round-up: how we\nResident film fanatic Mark Abdul crunches the box office numbers for this summer\u2019s releases, showing you the\nstories behind the data. The era of the August blockbuster seems to be on the wane, as audiences are swapping\nexplosion-heavy thrillers for more independent, culturally-aware films, such as Jordan Peele\u2019s hugely successful\nGet Out\nFILM\nMark Aduol\nFilm Editor\nD\nepending on\nwho you are,\nthe summer\nmovie season\nwas either a blessing or a\ndisaster.\nFor film studio\nexecutives, it was unquestionably dismal.\nThere was little comfort\nin watching each new\nrelease miss its box\noffice targets. On Labour\nDay Weekend \u2013 the long\nsummer weekend in the\nUnited States where\nfilm studios often expect\nmajor ticket sales \u2013 the\nU.S. box office had\nits worst performance\nin 17 years: the top\ntwelve films grossed a\ncombined $51.5 million\nand you have to go\nback to 2000, when\nthe top twelve grossed\n$47 million, to find a\nworse performance. No\ndoubt some film studio\nexecutives have already\nbegan questioning their\ntentative summer 2018\nreleases, wondering\nwhether some of those\nbig budget productions\nmight need a few re-writes, lest they suffer\nthe same fate as some\nof this year\u2019s box office\nflops.\nOn the other side of\nthe aisle however, film\ncritics and casual mov-iegoers were spoilt for\nchoice by the variety of\nfilms on offer. Wonder\nWoman, Spider-Man:\nHomecoming and Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2\nrounded out the annual\ninstalment of superhero\nflicks, while lower\nbudget productions like\nGet Out, Atomic Blonde\nand Girls Trip offered\naudiences something\nother than the avalanche\nof family-friendly\ncrowd-pleasers that have\ntraditionally dominated\nthe summer movie\nseason.\nIn summers past,\nalmost all high budget\nproductions \u2013 those with\nbudgets exceeding $100\nmillion \u2013 were usually\nviewed as guaranteed\nsuccesses by major\nfilm studios. Instead\nof acquiring an army\nof screenwriters and\nproducers that could\nmarshal a film towards\nAcademy Award glory,\nstudios focused their financial firepower on developing special effects\nbonanzas that would\ncapture the attention of\naudiences worldwide;\nbecause as lovely as an\nOscar nomination may\nbe, it matters little if\nyou don\u2019t have enough\nmoney to run your film\nstudio in the first place.\nConsequently, major\nfilm studios like Universal, Warner Bros.,\nand 20th Century Fox,\nall developed appetites\nfor producing high-budget blockbusters.\nJust consider the case\nof the Transformers\nfranchise: the first four\nfilms were all box office\nhits; released over the\n7-year period from\n2007 to 2014, each film\nmanaged to gross over\n$700 million worldwide,\nand the third and fourth\ninstalments in particular\nsucceeded in cracking\nthe $1 billion mark. By\nthe end of 2014, all four\nfilms occupied top-ten\nslots in Paramount\nPictures\u2019 list of its\nhighest-grossing films\nworldwide. Given such\nrunaway success, the\nexecutives at Paramount\nwere in no rush to drop\nthe Transformers franchise any time soon.\nFast-forward to 2017\nand we have our fifth\ninstalment in the series,\nTransformers: The Last\nKnight. Despite being\narmed with a budget of\n$217 million and marketing spending likely\nexceeding $100 million,\nthe film has \u201conly\u201d\nmanaged to gross $605.4\nmillion in the four\nmonths since its release.\nTo understand why this\nis bad, you first have to\nunderstand the difference between ticket sales\nin the North American\nmarket (where all major\nHollywood film studios\nare headquartered) and\nticket sales in foreign\nmarkets.\nWhen a movie ticket\nfor a wide release film\nis sold \u2013 say for around\n$10 \u2013 that revenue is\nsplit between several\nentities. If sold in the\nNorth American market,\naround $4 may go to the\nnot an isolated incident,\nit mirrors a general trend\nover the summer 2017\nmovie season.\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No\nTales suffered the lowest\nNorth American gross\nand the second-lowest\nworldwide gross out of\nany film in the series,\npulling in $794 million\nworldwide against a\n$230 million budget,\nwith roughly 78% of that\nrevenue coming from\nforeign markets \u2013 the\nhighest such percentage\nin the series 14-year\nhistory.\nUniversal\u2019s reboot of\nThe Mummy didn\u2019t fare\nmuch better: the film\ngrossed $80.1 million in\nNorth America and $329\nmillion in other territories for a worldwide\ntotal of $409.1 million,\nagainst a combined production and advertising\nbudget of around $345\nmillion. And of course,\ndue to the thinner profits\nfrom foreign markets,\nUniversal will likely lose\nin excess of $75 million\nfrom their investment in\nthis film.\nIt doesn\u2019t end there:\nthe co-produced Warner\nBros. and Legendary\nPictures epic, Kong:\nSkull Island, grossed\n$168 million in North\nAmerica and $398.6\nmillion in foreign\nmarkets for a worldwide\ntotal of $566.6 million.\nMade on a production\nbudget of $185 million\nand fuelled by a $136\nmillion marketing\ncampaign, this franchise\nreboot needed to make at\nleast $450-500 million\nworldwide for Warner\nBros. and Legendary\nPictures to break even.\nWhat does this string of\nbox office failures tell us?\nWell, for starters, audienc-Atomic Blonde (left), Baby Driver (right) // Universal/Sony Pictures\n\u201cStudios\nfocused their\nfinancial\nfirepower on\ndeveloping\nspecial effects\nbonanzas \u201d\ntheatre showcasing the\nfilm and the remaining\n$6 to the film studio that\nproduced it, but if sold\nin a foreign market, the\nfilm studio may only get\n$2, since the studio will\ntypically have to rely on\nseveral intermediaries\nto distribute its films in\ninternational markets.\nSo, when the latest\nTransformers instalment\ngrosses $130.2 million\nin North America and\n$475.2 million interna-tionally, compared to\nits predecessor\u2019s $245.4\nmillion North American\nand $858.6 million international gross, then the\nfilm is rightly viewed as\na box office disappoint-ment.\nAnd the underper-formance of Transformers: The Last Knight is\n\n"

The move\ncomes more than two\nmonths after the College\u2019s Campus Services\nimplemented changes\nwithout consulting staff\nor students.\nThe changes are largely\ncost-cutting measures.\nThese include reducing\nmenu options, portion\nsizes, and opening hours,\nin addition to replacing\nF-EAST in the Junior\nCommon Room with Japanese outlet Tanpopo.\nThe Imperial College\nwebsite claims that these\nP\nrotesters gathered outside the\nIraqi embassy\non Queen\u2019s Gate\nearlier this week in reaction to Iraq\u2019s seizure of\nthe city of Kirkuk from\nPro-Kurdish protesters gather outside Iraqi Embassy\nKurdish forces who had\noccupied it for the past\nthree years.\nLast Monday, 18th\nOctober, a group of\ndemonstrators took to the\nspeech, carrying Kurdish\nflags and chanting slogans\nlike \u201clong live Kurdistan,\nlong live freedom.\u201d\nPolice closed off a part\nof Queen\u2019s Gate in both\ndirections, and maintained\na heavy presence. Fire and\nambulance services were\nalso on the scene.\nFootage posted on\nsocial media shows protesters throwing objects at\nthe building and smashing\nwindows. Other scenes\ndepict a number of demonstrators trying to break\ndown the door to the\nembassy. One managed\nto enter the building and\nremove an Iraqi flag,\nwhich they threw to the\nground and stamped on.\nProtesters arrived at the\nembassy, which is located\nopposite the Blackett and\nHuxley buildings, shortly\nafter 4pm. They remained\nin the area for over an hour\nbefore dispersing. Scotland Yard confirmed that\ntwo people had entered the\nbuilding, but that nobody\nwas arrested.\nThe protests and\nseizure of Kirkuk comes\nthree weeks after Kurds\nvoted for independence.\nAlthough Kirkuk lies\noutside the borders of the\nautonomous Kurdistan\nregion, it has been home\nto more than one million\nKurds since Iraqi forces\nabandoned the city in\n2014 to fight Islamic\nState. The area is rich in\noil, which it primarily\nexports to Turkey. Trade\nbetween Kurdistan and\nTurkey is worth more\nthan \u00a37.4 billion a year.\nDespite this, Turkish\npresident Recep Tayyip\nErdo\u011fan has threatened\nto shut down business\nrelations in an attempt\nto set aside the result of\nthe referendum. Kurdish\nleader Masoud Barzani\nhas urged the international\ncommunity for peace. He\nsaid: \u201cWe are committed\nto a dialogue process with\nBaghdad. Threats will\nsolve nothing.\u201d\nNEWS\nchanges will benefit the\nwider community. It also\nmakes note of how much\ninvestment in catering\nfacilities costs, making a\npoint to mention \u201cthese\nservices operate at a loss\u201d\nand are heavily subsidised.\nDespite this, Imperial\u2019s\n2015-16 accounts reported\nan overall surplus income\nof \u00a384.5 million.\nThe website adds that\nthe changes should have\na minimal impact on students and staff. However,\nas Felix reported this\nAugust, postgraduate students and staff were displeased when the Senior\nCommon Room stopped\nserving breakfast. Since\nthen, complaints have\ncontinued to come in, with\none Imperial academic\ntelling Felix: \u201cI have received several complaints\nfrom our students: they\nusually only get one hour\nto eat between lectures\nand are not happy to\nspend their lunch break in\na queue or finding a seat.\nThey do not have time to\neat and relax.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe other\nday I tried to get my\nlunch at 12.15, between\ntwo meetings, and I only\nhad 30 minutes to eat. I\nusually grab a sandwich\nat the JCR but that was\nnot an option because of\nthe massive queues. I tried\nseveral other food outlets\nwith no luck \u2013 there were\nlong queues everywhere. I\nwent to my meeting with\nan empty stomach and\nhad lunch at 2pm.\u201d The\nCollege told Felix that\nthey \u201caim to provide the\nbest possible service and\nexperience for our staff\nand student community.\u201d\nThe Union told Felix\nthat they were conducting\nthe Campus Services\nFeedback survey \u201cto better\nunderstand the opinions of\nour members regarding the\nchanges which occurred\nover the summer to the\nCampus Services outlets,\nand to gain a deeper\ninsight into the consumer\nhabits across the Imperial\ncommunity.\u201d\nThe Graduate Students\u2019\nUnion (GSU) has urged\nImperial to listen to\nstudents\u2019 feedback and\nreconsider the changes. In\na statement, the GSU told\nFelix: \u201cThese changes, although financially rational\non the College\u2019s part, send\nthe wrong message to our\npostgraduate community,\nespecially considering\nhow much we value equal\nprovision and opportunities for both undergraduate\nand postgraduate students.\nMany students have approached us expressing a\nfeeling of neglect.\u201d\nIn a statement from the\nUnion, a representative\nsaid that \u201cWith a good\nresponse rate from our\nmembersandfromCollege\nstaff, we will be better\nplaced to lobby College\nto adapt the services to\nbetter serve our members\nand challenge them when\nappropriate.\u201d\nLaunching the feedback\nsurvey is a step in the\nright direction. Aside from\ngathering demographic in-formation, it asks student\nwhich outlets they use\nand when, as well as when\nthey would like to use the\noutlets. There are no mentions of other issues raised\nby staff and students\n\u2013 such as the changes to\nEthos\u2019 opening hours \u2013 although a comment box is\nprovided at the end of the\nsurvey.\nThe survey is available\nat: http://www.imperial-collegeunion.org/CSFeed-back.\nWill we ever see the return of cooked breakfasts? // ICU\nUnion launches survey of College\u2019s Campus Services\nLast Monday\nprotesters gathered\noutside the embassy in\na pro-Kurdish protest\nProtesters gather outside the embassy // Felix\n\n"

That is the message\nof Saint George in reference to a life lived under\nthe rule of the despotic\ndragon. On the face of\nthings these two characters\nshould be at the heart of an\nepic tale of heroism versus\nevil, but Rory Mullarkey\u2019s\nplay is not simply a classic\nheroic legend \u2013 it is a\ncommentary on the people\nof England. The day of\nthe hero is gone and we\nmust all band together to\novercome the new dragons\nof capitalist greed, bureau-cracy, and indifference: a\npowerful and insightful\nmessage, although its\ndelivery in this production\nhad a subtlety more akin\nto that of George\u2019s great\nthree-headed nemesis than\nthe damsel in distress.\nThis tale at first takes\non a very literal form.\nThe dragon himself is\na tyrannical ruler who\ncan transform into the\nform of the three-headed,\nfire-breathing beast.\nHowever, we soon see\nthe village evolve into a\npost-industrial revolution\ntown and from a town it\ngrows into a modern city\nakin to any in Britain\ntoday. So too grows the\ndragon, progressively\ntaking on a new, less\ntangible form in each of\nthe three ages. Although\nthe setting is described as\nan island \u2018much like our\nown\u2019, it is like our island\nin almost every way. The\nmodern city is complete\nwith pub brawls, hen\nparties, and microwave\nmeals \u2013 a blatant indication that this is a message\ntargeted towards the real\nBritain of the present day.\nThe message is clear:\nthe burden of improving\nthe world can no longer\nfall on just one person,\nand the solution is certainly not to be found in an\noutdated, historical figure.\nThe elephant in the room\n\u2013 or should I say dragon\n\u2013 is Brexit. A proponent\nof change, the play is a\ndamning indictment of the\nbelief that our solutions lie\n\u201cThe play is\na damning\nindictment of\nthe belief that\nour solutions\nlie in going\nback to a\nsimpler time\u201d\nin going back to a simpler\ntime, but it is also critical\nof those who fervently\noppose this view \u2013 we\ncan sometimes become so\nutterly caught up in what\nwe think is right that it\ncauses us to destroy the\nthings we were trying to\ndefend in the first place.\nSolidarity and a sense\nof community is the one\nconstant that can pull us\nthrough.\nDespite the message\nbeing very relevant, the\nproduction itself was\nalmost three hours in\nlength, and combined with\nthe fact that the storyline\nis designed to repeat itself\nthree times, at times it\nmade me feel as though\nwe needed a dragon to set\nfire to the stage to spice\nthe plot up a bit.\nLyndsey Turner\u2019s\nproduction is speckled\nwith humour throughout,\nkeeping the mood at the\nright level. This is helped\nby the cast, notably Julian\nBleach who plays the\ndragon, whose character\nand style reminded me of\nCount Olaf in the film adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events. Toeing\nthe line between evil and\nhilarity, his persona was\nvery satisfyingly reptilian.\nDespite the light-hearted\nmood, it is remarkable\nhow effectively Luke\nBrady manages to change\nthe atmosphere to one\nof sadness with his convincing portrayal of the\nMiller\u2019s Son \u2013 the pitiable\nvictim of the dragon\u2019s\nfury. John Heffernan as\nSaint George paints a\nportrait of a confident\ncharacter throughout, who\nis so set in his ways that\nhe cannot understand why\nmodern society can\u2019t be\nthe way it used to be. His\noverly-patient sweetheart\nElsa, played by Amaka\nOkafor, is strongest\nwhen torn away from the\nconventional role of the\nheroine, when in conflict\nwith Henry (Richard\nGoulding) or her father\nCharles (Gawn Grainger).\nThe young talent Reuel\nGuzman who plays \u2018boy\u2019\nstands out for his assured\nperformance.\nThe scenery and technical aspects of the performance were brilliant.\nThis was especially true\nfor all manner of things\nrelating to fire. Things\nwere constantly spontaneously igniting, crackling\nor exploding all over the\nstage to the extent that I\nbegan to question whether\nthere was indeed an actual\ndragon crouched behind\nthe scenes. Despite the\ntechnical brilliance \u2013 and\nin part because of it \u2013 I\nfelt slightly short changed\nwatching the battle\nbetween George and the\ndragon. What we had all\nbeen expectantly awaiting\nturned out to be more of a\nradio commentary by the\nvillagers of a supposedly\nnail-biting fight in the\ninvisible sky above us.\nAdmittedly recreating a\nbattle involving a three\nheaded dragon may have\nbeen fairly technically\nchallenging, but given the\nexcellency of the other\nscenery I wouldn\u2019t put\nit past the crew to have\npulled it off. The lack of\na convincing battle scene\nwas partially compensated\nfor by the pyrotechnically\nheavy display of three\ndragon heads exploding\nas they crashed into the\nground.\nIt would have been\nbetter if the message\nhadn\u2019t been so obvious in\nits structured three-part\ndelivery, but I thought that\nit was unique and very\nrelevant. The characters\nare almost all referred\nto by job title rather\nthan name, perhaps for a\nreason: in our everyday\nlives we ourselves see\nhere the butcher, there the\ndriver, and the town crier.\nMullarkey is trying to tell\nus that these people do\nnot represent us, they are\nus \u2013 each and every one of\nus must be prepared to be\nheroic in our own way.\nDelivering the Bud Light petition to the Union // Johan Persson\nWhere?

But...\nwhat\u2019s so shameful about\nwanting?\u201d. Loneliness,\nand the barriers we set\nup even as we try to\nforge new connections\nare at the centre of David\nEldridge\u2019s new play. In\nBeginning, we meet Laura\nand Danny at the end of a\nhousewarming party. She\nis a 38-year-old managing\ndirector who, despite\nprofessional success, is\nlooking for a catalyst to\nsettle down, and he is\nfriend of a friend who stays\nbehind after everyone has\nleft despite his impulses to\nrun. Both are hiding their\nfear of being alone, tipsy,\nand yearning; they dance\naround each other (some-times literally), wanting\nvery much to be seen, and\nat the same time, terrified\nof being exposed.\nThe beats of Eldridge\u2019s\nnarrative feel Tennessee\nWilliams-esque: A Cat on\na Hot Tin Roof for the Tinder-age. Only here, stifling\n\u201850s Mississippi repression has been replaced by\nan equally stifling English\none in the present day.\nLaura, Maggie-like, is\ndriven wild by a hunger to\nfill a life she considers a\n\u2018shell\u2019. Danny, who at 42\nhasn\u2019t seen his daughter in\nfour years, is back living\nwith his Mum after the\nbreak up of a marriage and\nseems a latter-day Brick\nPolitt \u2013 struggling with\nthe idea he has let his life\nslip through his fingers.\nJust as Williams cut to\nthe bone of mid-century\nAmerica, Eldridge has\na knack of finding just\nthe right words: \u201cI just\ncan\u2019t face another Sunday\nalone,\u201d says Laura at one\npoint in a desperate plea\nto stop Danny calling a\nage of social media \u2013 true\nconnections feel out of\nreach even as they seem to\nbe only a click away.\nMuch like the charac-ters, the play cloaks its\ntender, vulnerable core\nin an armour of humour.\nBeginning is frequently\npainfully funny, \u2018painful\u2019\nbeing the operative word.\nSeveral times during\nthe play I wonder: \u201cis it\nactually possible to die\nof secondhand embarrassment?\u201d. As Laura\nand Danny go to ever\nincreasing lengths to avoid\nconfronting their desire for\neach other, sitting in the\naudience feels like having\nan out-of-body experience\nat every awkward date\nyou\u2019ve wanted to go well.\nIt is difficult to watch and\neven more difficult to tear\nyour eyes away.\nThe story unfolds\nover an hour and forty\nminutes in real time \u2013 a\nlot is revealed. Laura and\nDanny go from strangers\nwho can\u2019t take their eyes\noff each other to telling\neach other things they\u2019ve\nnever told anyone else.\nObjectively, the two cover\nmore emotional ground\nthan someone might cover\nin years of therapy, yet\nfor me none of it seemed\ntoo much. Polly Findlay\u2019s\ndirection is masterful,\nallowing the audience,\nand the characters, room\nto breathe in between the\nrevelations.\nJustine Mitchell and\nSam Troughton deliver\nwonderfully nuanced per-formances, doing justice\nto Eldridge\u2019s carefully\ncrafted work.As the fragile\nthread of desire crystal-lises into a more lasting\nunderstanding between\nthe couple, Troughton in\nparticular does a wonderful job of peeling back\nthe layers on Danny, who\n\u2013 once he manages to get\nhis foot out of his mouth\n\u2013 transforms from a guy\nwith one too many laddish\nquips to a kind, wounded\nman. Likewise, Mitchell\nis magnetic to watch as\nLaura, who at first seems\nto have her life figured\nout, but from whom we\nsee a different side when\nher confident facade\nbegins to crumble as the\nplay goes on. Both, we\nsee, are broken in a way\nthe other could fix. As the\nnight wears on, we can\u2019t\nhelp but want to push them\ntogether, urge them to sort\nthings out, and wonder\nwhere will it end: a one\nnight stand or parenthood\nand a life together ?\nWhat is remarkable\nabout the play is how real\nit all seems. As Laura and\nDanny live out the night on\nFly Davis\u2019 richly detailed\nset, we could be peeking\nthrough the windows into\nthe ungainly, fumbling\nbeginnings of a real re-lationship. It takes a rare\ntalent to craft and bring to\nlife characters with such\nvividness, especially ones\nthat linger in the mind like\nthese ones do. After a long\nabsence, this is a welcome\nreturn to the forefront of\nBritish theatre for David\nEldridge. Beginning is\nmagnificent \u2013 don\u2019t miss\nit.\nExquisitely painful, wonderfully joyous: Beginning is an intimate portrayal of loneliness in the age of Tinder\nJustine Mitchell and Sam Troughton in the intimate Beginning // Johan Persson\nWhere?

EY Sailing, based\nin Lefkada, offered us an\nexcellent deal for cruising\nthe Ionian islands and were\namazing hosts, showing\nus beautiful spots as we\nsailed between islands,\nenabling us to enjoy Greek\nhospitality to its fullest.\nWe were met by Costas\nat the airport. He took us to\nan air-conditioned minibus\nand, after a short transfer,\nwe pulled up right next to\nour boat, Lito, a Bavaria\n44 cruiser (44-foot long).\nPerfect for enjoying the\nMediterranean and island\nhopping, it had plenty of\nspace for all eight of us.\nElias, our skipper and\nand co-owner of EY\nsailing, greeted us on\nthe comfortable yacht.\nHaving set ourselves up\nin our cabins we joined\nElias on deck and had\na relaxed but thorough\nbriefing on the important\nparts of boat living. This\nnot only featured sailing\naspects of the yacht and\nsafety, but also free-diving\nand spear-fishing, something that EY also focus\non. Elias made us feel\ncompletely at home and\ncontinued to tell us about\nthe Ionian islands, Greek\nfood, and island lifestyle.\nIt made such a difference\n\u201cWe visited a\nsecret location\nI can\u2019t even\nreveal in this\narticle \u2013 one\nthat has to\nbe seen to be\nappreciated\u201d\nsailing and water activ-ities, who offered such\namazing local knowledge\nand sincere hospitality.\nMoored up stern to,\nright by the town, we\nventured into Lefkada for\nour first dinner, eating at a\nreasonably priced restau-rant, considered one of the\nbest in the area. Octopus,\nsquid, mussels, and local\nfish were washed down\nby Greek wine before we\nheaded back to the yacht\nfor our first night aboard.\nAfter a good night\u2019s\nsleep and a Greek coffee\nthe next morning, we\ncould sense that we had a\ngreat week lined up. When\nwe got to unfurl the sails\nthe yahct was surprisingly\nagile and light for its size.\nLito was a joy to sail and\neasy for even our less experienced crew to handle.\nThroughout the week\nwe stopped off at other\nislands \u2013 Kastos, Ithaca,\nand Kefalonia. Kastos\nwas a tiny island of only\n40 residents during the\nsummer and fewer in the\nwinter when the facilities\nclose. We went ashore\nand enjoyed a drink in at\na table alongside an old\nwindmill and then went\nswimming from a rocky\nbeach nearby.\nAt Ithaca we had several\nstops. A larger island than\nKastos but still only just\nover 3000 inhabitants.\nAgain great food, refreshing swimming but also an\narchaeological museum\nwith ancient Greek items\nthat have been found on the\nisland. Naturally, touring\nthe Greek Islands with a\nlocal free-diver led us to\nsome absolutely beautiful\nswimming locations, both\nunder and above the water.\nThe icing on the cake was\nwatching Elias go down\nand spear our dinner which\nhe prepared on board (later\nin the trip we took another\ncatch to a restaurant who\ncooked it for us).\nKefalonia was another\nstop, a much larger Ionian\nisland with a population\nin excess of 30,000. We\ntook the opportunity to\nvisit a well known tourist\nsite, the beautiful lake\nof Melissani Cave on\nKefalonia \u2013 a water-filled\ncave with a collapsed roof\nopen to the sky. Another\nincredible location was\nwhat Elias knows as Crack\nEnd, almost unknown to\nothers visiting the islands,\nand a secret location that\nI can\u2019t even reveal in this\narticle \u2013 one that has to be\nseen to be appreciated!\nThroughout the week\nwe split our time between\nthese island outings and\nboat living. Diving in from\nthe deck into crystal clear\nwater, swinging from the\nhalyard, \u201chydro-massage\u201d\n(being pulled along behind\nthe boat), and swimming\nto beautiful locations only\naccessible from the sea\nwere all truly exhilarating.\nOur friends at EY\nsailing gave us an unforgettable experience out on\nthe Ionian Sea, and we\u2019re\ncertain to be returning next\nyear. Feel free to email\nICYC, and ask us any\nquestions about the Greek\ntour, China Cup Regatta,\nthe EDHEC Regatta in\nFrance, and weekend trips\nwe run regularly down in\nthe Solent. We also hope to\nbring in some educational\ncourses to let our members\nlearn about sailing before\neven hitting the water or\nto gain the qualifications\nthey\u2019re looking for.\nWhen you want to work on your tan, but you\u2019re Fitzpatrick skin type I // ICYC\n\u201cIt made such\na difference\nto have a local\nskipper who\nwas passionate\nabout sailing\nand the water\u201d\nto have a local skipper\nwho was passionate about\nThe yacht was the one taking the photo // ICYC\n\n"

Over his life\nhe acquired a collection so\nlarge that later generations\nof staff took to describing\nits contents by the tonne.\nAfter his death in 1936\nhis collection was still\nstored in vast warehouses,\nunseen and incomplete.

To regulars,\nthe first thing you will\nnotice is the sparseness of\nthe space for Can Graphic\nDesign Save Your Life?\nThe experience is\nswift and quick with\nvisits peaking at around\nan hour, and sections\ncentred around topics like\npersuasion, education,\nhospitalisation and con-tagion. Objects are given\nvast spaces, and this may\nbe in part because almost\nall are printed: advertising\nposters, photos, pharmacy\nbags, stamps, a 17th\nCentury lift-the-flap book.\nHighlights include a\nparticularly fascinating\ndisplay on Saatchi &\nSaatchi\u2019s advertising\ncampaign for Silk Cut\ncigarettes and an image\nof artist Stephen Doe\npainting symptoms of\nEbola on a wall, to inform\ncitizens during the height\nof the 2014 outbreak in\nLiberia.\nNewAntibioticResistanceTrackingProjectAnnounced\nT\nhe Global Burden\nof Disease\nAntimicrobial\nR e s i s t a n c e\nproject was announced at\nWellcome\u2019s Call to Action\nconference in Berlin last\nweek.
