    "content": "MUSIC\nby Phil Young\nThis looks like a big week for the\nindie/thrash/shambling/garage/call-it-what-you-like scene. Kicking off are\nthe Bodeans, proving that the\nAmericans can do it just as well as us\n(thrash and shamble, that is), at ULU\ntonight, plugging their album Outside\nLooking In and their debut UK single\nDreams. Along the same line are the\nWedding Present, playing London for\nthe fir t time since their album George\nBest hit the big time. Supporting them\nat the Town and Country Club,\ntonight, are the Close Lobsters and the\nFlatmates\u2014yes, more of the same,\nbut the Close Lobsters are about the\nbest of their ilk, and manage to keep\ntheir musical influences hidden, with\nmore variety than most. Finally\ntonight Alien Sex Fiend provide a welcome break with punk y rock\nsounds, at the Astoria's Apocalypse\nClub, which opens at 11pm On Sunday the Woodentops play\nBrixton Academy. Emerging from yet\nmore shambling indie thrash, they\nnow inject much more variety into\ntheir sound, incorporating some\npleasant surprises. Adding to the\nvariety are the support\u2014 Yargo\nplaying hard, jazzy soul, and African\nHeadcharge with hip-hop p ish reggae.:\nAlbum Review\nThe Godfathers: Birth, School,\nWork, Death\nHit by Hit, the compilation of their\nfirst four singles on Corporate Image,\ntook the indie charts by storm this\ntime last year. This album, released\non Epic, promises to do the same to\nthe mainstream charts. The opening\nnumber\u2014the title track\u2014is the good\nold no-nonsense rock we expect from\nthe Godfathers with bitter lyrics\nwhich encompass politics, drugs, sex\nand the futility of it all. Then there\ncome some surprises; the next songs\nsound more like the harder Rolling\nStones with twenty years' worth of\nevolution. The music and lyrics are\nabrupt, with such tried and tested rock\nthemes as drugs and love, with a humourous arrogance. Totally out of\ncharacter is When am I corning down,\nwhich is purely psychedelic and\nbrilliant. The second side resorts to\nwhat the Godfathers are best at, pure,\narrogant, protesting hard rock, with\nvocalist Peter Coyne asserting his\npersonal rebellion. A possible\nreference to the arms race is followed\nby more good old rock lyrics about\nlove. This album is a masterpiece of\nuncompromising Clash-style hard\nrock with none of the pretentious\nmachismo of heavy metal. Undiluted,\nearthy and with a damn good rhythm.\nRACING\nby Paul Shanley\nThe observant amongst you will have\nnoticed racing tips appearing in this\naugust journal in the past few weeks.\nThe only problem with this is that\nFELIX deadlines are such that the\nweekend selections have to be made\non a Thursday morning. Inevitably,\nthis means that some non-runners are\nbound to slip through the net.\nLast week's batch produced three\nnon-runners. However, the other\nselection came up trumps with\nPlayschool beating the odds-on\nfavourite Forgive 'n' Forget by a commanding eight lengths to win the\nIrish Gold Cup at Leopardstown on\nSaturday.\nJoe Coral now makes Playschool\n4-1 favourite to take the Cheltenham\nGold Cup on St Patrick's Day. An\ninteresting showdown with Cavvies\nClown is promised here subject to\nclearance by the Jockey Club on\ndoping allegations. Watch this space\nnearer the Cheltenham Festival for\nmore news.\nLooking further ahead, the weights\nare now available for the Grand\nNational on April 9th. The\nhandicapper has been a bit tough on\nlast year's third placed Lean Ar\nAghaidh who starts a stone heavier\nthan his '87 trip.\nLast year's runner-up The\nTsarevich looks to be the best bet at\nthe weights. The 12-year old is 91b better than Lean Ar Aghaidh and will\ntake some beating. 25-1 is being\noffered ante-post at Corals and\nMecca.\nIt doesn't look like there will be any\nmajor upsets this year but the best\noutsider seems to be The Tsarevich's stable-mate Galway Blaze\u2014Hennesy\nwinner of '85. Latest word from Nick\nHenderson's yard is that he has a5050 chance of making it to Aintree.\nOne to watch.\nThis week's tips appear in the news\npages.\nJF00TBALL\nby Adrian Grainger\nArsenal vs Manchester Utd.\nHighbury (Arsenal tube)\nThis is billed as the game of the day\nand along with the all Merseyside\nclash, the Cup will lose two of its\nfavourites. The equivalent league\nmeeting produced a victory for the\nReds of Old Trafford, so the Gunners\nwill be eager for revenge. The two\nclubs have good Cup records (6 final\nappearances in the last 10 years\nbetween them) and 11 Cup victories\nin their histories. (33 semi-finals as.\nwell!) If a football fan is asked which\nfinal he remembers most, then the\nmind flashes back to 1979. Arsenal\nat 2-0 looked invincible with five\nminutes to go, but United pulled it\nback to 2-2 only for Sunderland to\npoke the ball home for an Arsenal\nvictory, real Roy of the Rovers stuff.\nThose days are gone but Rocastle,\nGroves, Adams et al should repeat the\n'79 triumph over Fergie's men to give\nLondon a strong chance of another\nCup victory. Arsenal to win in a thriller.\nQPR vs Luton Town\nLoftus Road (White City tube)\nThis is a pseudo derby game, putting\ntwo of the top sides of Division One\nin a Cup game, with a place in the last\n8 to fight for. Rangers disposed of\nWest Ham in the previous round and\nare feeling confident that this will be\ntheir year again to reach the final.\nThey were defeated at Everton last\nweek with my tip for the top Paul\nParker putting through his own net.\nThe Hatters are used to playing on\nplastic fantastic (I really mean that it's, crap) and they must fancy their\nchances with Mark Stein playing so\nwell, this will be a close game but\nQPR should sneak it by the odd goal\nin three.\nCharlton vs Sheffield Wed.\nSelhurst Park (Norwood Jtn tube)\nCharlton still hold up Division One\nand I wouldn't bet against them from\ndoing this come May-time.\nWednesday have been playing well\nlately but were surprisingly\nhammered 3-0 at Coventry last week.\nThis league meeting is more\nimportant for the home team but\nWednesday will be eager to maintain\na top half placing. Charlton led\nWimbledon last week but had to settle\nfor a point. Sheffield have a good side\nwith Martin Hodge, Mark\nChamberlain and Lee Chapman\ncoming to mind. A draw is the most\nprobable result but look out for a home win with a little bit of luck.\nMillwall vs Oldham\nThe Den (New Cross tube)\nThe Lions are pushing for promotion\nin a league where any of the top 11\nmust fancy their chances with a good\nrun in at the end of the season. A good, close win from behind at\nReading last week kept Millwall in the\nhunt with Sheringham notching up a couple of goals. Joe Royle and his\nOldham side were never out of the top\n3 in the league last year and were a victim of the play-offs. This season\nthey have languished near the bottom\nof the table, but a respectable mid-table position looks likely. They lost\n5-3 at Bradford last week with Andy\nRitchie grabbing two. Millwall to take\nmaximum points.\nFulham vs Walsall\nCraven Cottage (Putney Bridge tube)\nFulham entertain a top side in this\nThird Division game, who already\nhave 7 away victories and are looking\nfor 8. Fulham have a poor home\nrecord and look on thin ice with this\none. Walsall are 3rd in the 3rd( confused?) and have a poetical\nmidfielder in Craig Shakespeare and\nex-Man City striker Trevor Christie\nupfront. Walsall have been pushing\nfor promotion for years and have\nnever quite made it. I hope that this\nwill be their year. Walsall to win and\ngain promotion later on!\nLeyton Orient vs Cardiff City\nBrisbane Road (Leyton tube)\nThis is a real top of the table clash for\nDivision Four fans. Orient have fallen\na little recently with a close defeat at\nScunthorpe last week not helping\nFrank Clark and his men at all.\nCardiff, a recent 4-1 away winner at\ntop of the table Wolves, are having\na great season and lie second at the\nmoment. The Welshmen have ex-Southampton star Alan Curtis and ex-Brummie Nicky Platnaver in their\nsquad and should prove strong\nopposition. Cardiff to take at least a point.\nGame of the day: Arsenal vs Man\nUtd.\nMy Cup last 8: Birmingham,\nWimbledon, QPR, Arsenal, Man\nCity, Port Vale, Portsmouth and\nLiverpool.\nA special mention for my hero Eddie\nEdwards, jumping in the 90m ski-jump at Calgary on Saturday. What\na star, what a competitor, what a prat!\n10 Friday February 19th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "I EE II MM! Happy New Year to all our Chinese\nstudents at Imperial. May the Year of\nthe Dragon be as good as the last.\nI hear that the weather's been good\nall this week. Could the Union please\nput a sunlamp in my basement?\nRag\u2014who gives the money?\nSomething has been concerning me\nrecently. Imperial's Rag Committee\nhas been the strongest and keenest for\nseveral years and is going to raise the\nlargest amount for charity ever this\nyear. This is excellent and deserves\nthe highest praise in the world.\nCharity work gives students a good\nname, yes, but should we be\ncollecting amongst ourselves or out\nin the community? There have been\nan abundance of sponsored events this\nyear: the Piano Marathon, the Firkin\nRuns, the Bed Push, etc, etc. All the\nmoney raised from such sponsored\nevents comes from Imperial students,\nwho can ill-afford it and are probably\ngetting a little sick of being accosted\nby their friends who want their\nsignatures and, eventually, their\nmoney. I think, as an ex-Vice\nPresident of the Rag Committee, that\nit is time to put aside sponsored events\nin favour of events which raise money\nwhilst entertaining. Alternatively,\narranging more public collections. Of\ncourse, this would require much more\nwork than organising sponsored\nevents, but with the new Honorary\nSecretary (Events) this shouldn't be\na problem, should it?\nLetters\nWhy did the MOPSOC and AstroSoc\ncommittees demand that their letter be\nprinted in this week's FELLX and why\ndid I print it? Normally I wouldn't print a letter like theirs as I feel that\nsuch letters should only be written if\nall verbal reasoning has failed. I printed it because I would have been\nopen to all sorts of criticisms about\ncensorship of embarrassing letters if\nI hadn't.I don't invite criticism. I invite constructive debate. I would\nprefer any clubs who do have gripes\nagainst the Print Unit to come and talk\nto me, in my capacity as Print Unit\nManager, and if you don't feel happy\nwith my explanations, then write to\nFELIX.\nOn the other hand, if you have\ncriticisms about the content of\nFELIX, please write in straight away.\nDon't write articles for C CU magazines, especially if you're going\nto get your facts wrong.\nIs FELIX the SUN of student\nnewspapers?\nTry comparing the news story we ran\non Ian Howgate's name change last\nweek to the one in The Sun on\nMonday. Nuff said.\nCARP\nCARP is a branch of the Moonies and\nthey have been approaching Imperial\nCollege students once more this year.\nIt happens every year. If you are\napproached by CARP on College\npremises, please inform security so\nthat they can throw them off.\nWho cares\nI find the Union Council'sI attend\nmore and more disheartening. I think\nthat most of the members are more\nlike those nodding dogs that you see\nin the back of cars rather than Union\nofficers. The only people who ask\nquestions at these meetings are,\ncoincidentally (?), those who are\nstanding in this year's sabbatical\nelections, and even these people ask\ndr i villy questions.\nThe Council on Monday was a prime example of this phenomenon. x One person asked the recurring\nquestion: 'When is Ian Howgate\ngoing to write a report for FELIX?'\nIan replied 'I'm not' and not a single\nperson asked him to justify why he\nwasn't, given that all past presidents\nhave written a regular report. Is no\none concerned? Does anybody want\nto know what Mr Howgate does with\nhis 8 hours Monday to Friday? If you\ndo then I would urge you to ask him\nat Tuesday extraordinary Union\nGeneral Meeting in the JCR.\nGERBILL\nWhat is GERBILL and why should\nevery IC student be concerned about\nit. GERBILL is the Great Educational\nReform Bill proposed by Kenneth\nBaker but that's about all most of us\nknow about it. There are some pretty\nscary implications to it, though, if all\nthe proposals go through. For\ninstance, the Government want to\ncompletely restructure the way\nuniversities receive their funding.\nThey want to fund departments\nindividually. But who will fund the\nUnion? There are so many other\npoints to be considered, and possibly,\nopposed. Please read page 4 to find\nout more and turn up to the UGM\nnext Tuesday to discuss the Bill and\nits implications.\nFinally...\nWe still have a few sweatshirts and\nt shirts left!\nEditor-in-chief Judith Hackney\nBusiness Manager Chris Martin\nReviews Editor Charles Robin\nFeatures Editor Kamala Sen\nClubs Editor Andrew Waller\nSports Editors Dominic Strowbridge\nand 'Hector' Sullivan\nScience Editor Steve Black\nTypesetting Rose Atkins\nPrinting Dean Vaughan\nContributors: Chris Jones, Al Birch, Adrian Bourne, Dave Jones, Pippa\nSalmon, Adrian Grainger, Phil Young, William Lumb, Martyn Peck, Noel\nCurry, Martin Cole, Thomas Grieg, Pippa Salmon, Kamala Sen, Chris\nMartin, Lloyd, Rupert, Simon, Paul Shanley, Neil Motteram, John Noble,\nMax (I love you really) and all the other colla tors.1 HIS WEE IC\nfT?ASER.FufAtS\nA80mT COLVEbfc\nA J COT A OO ATiolO:'\nT~ HEI\u00ab.

One snoopy, apply Flat C9\narmed with pints of cider.\n\u2022 88+84=69? But not before 12!\nSour grapes\nDear Judith,\nI was surprised and disappointed to read Mr Basma's letter\n(FELIX 12.2.88). I have the following comments to make.\nI accepted the advice of the committee for four out of the\nfive re-apps, which is hardly 'ignoring' the committee's 'choices', one of whom was Mr Basma. Fortunately, as\nsubsequent events have shown, he withdrew his application\nas he wanted to share a flat with our current Ents rep next\nyear. So it seems that out of the five re-apps chosen, I am\nonly responsible for one of those not selected, and Mr Basma\nfor the other. I am sorry if Mr Basma doesn't like the selection\nprocedure for re-apps (however it is not in my power to change\nthis); he is welcome to make a representation to the College\nSecretary, Level 5, Sherfield Building.\nIncidentally, I do most strongly object to my quotes in the\nletter, which are pure fabrication on the part of Mr Basma.\nThis leads me to what I assume to be the centre of Mr\nBasma's 'sour grapes'\u2014the Diggers Club. As with any other\nresident of Mining House, I welcome any social activity in\nthe house, and as such, a social club has a valuable role to\nplay in the life of the House, initiating and organising activities\netc. However, in its present form, the Diggers Club does not\ncater for (or appeal to) the majority of Mining House residents,\nalthough I do not deny that it may have done so in the past.\nI'm sorry if Mr Basma is unhappy with the social life of\nthe House, but this is dependent to a large extent on the House\nCommittee\u2014elected by the residents. I would welcome and\nsupport any suggestions he may have, parenthetically, Mining\nHouse is still looking forward to the start of Mr Basma's project which he raised money for three months ago.\nWith the help of the House Committee and sub wardens I have arranged a variety of events, open parties, barbecues,\nfilm, theatre and restaurant trips, an outward-bound weekend,\nan international cuisine evening, cocktail, coffee evenings,\na Chinese New Year party, a Coming-Up Dinner and a boat\ntrip for the summer term.\nPresumably this is the 'unsociable' house which he refers to.\nI have yet to hear of any constructive 'sociable' ideas\nemanating from Mr Basma, unless drinking ten pints of beer\n(as involved in the Diggers' initiation) and throwing-up over\nthe newly decorated house is his idea of sociability. Perhaps\nthe Subwardens and newly selected re-apps are behind me\n'through thick and thin' because they view 'sociability' in\nslightly different terms than Mr Basma: has it occurred to him\nthat his opinions may not be popularly held?\nMy appointed job as Warden is to consider the welfare and\nhappiness of ALL Mining House residents, and to maintain\nthe good name of Imperial College. If Mr Basma has any\nsuggestions for improving the sociability of Mining House\nthen perhaps he could inform the Ents rep, his house rep, or\nmyself.\nSuch public exchanges in FELIX can only damage the\nreputation of Mining House, something I'm sure he would\nnot wish to do.\nYours sincerely,\nMs C Brown.\nPrint Unit trouble\nDear Judith,\nEarly last term, MOPSOC and Astrosoc drew up designs\nfor new membership cards, and requested FELIX print them.\nWhen they arrived, they were half the size requested, squashed\nup and without borders. Two-thirds of them were not usable\nthrough smudging, poor printing or, as in some cases, through\nhaving the Balloon Club logo printed over them.\nUnderstanding that FELIX was having some trouble with its\nprint unit we returned the cards and went elsewhere for our\nprinting, at some cost and delayed by several weeks. As a gesture of goodwill, however, we decided not to register any\ncomplaint.\nIt was thus with some surprise that a few weeks later a bill\nfor materials was received, especially as it represented\nconsiderably more than the original verbal estimate. Presuming\nthat this was merely a tentative attempt on the part of FELIX\nto recoup costs on a disastrous print run, we let it pass. We\ndidn't feel that RCSU should sub sid is e FELIX's printing\nproblems.\nLast week we were informed that a letter had been sent to\nRCSU, over our heads, labelling us as bad creditors and\nrequesting that the money be debited forthwith from our\naccounts, without our authorisation.\nThis is not acceptable, FELIX has a monopoly over a number of services to clubs. We are legally obliged to pay\nfor unsatisfactory goods and it is blackmail if FELIX uses\nwithdrawal of its services to force us to do so. For FELIX\nto go over the heads of club presidents and to remove money\nfrom their accounts, amounts to nothing less than robbery.\nI can only hope that the whole affair is an administrative\noversight and that FELIX's business manager was unaware\nfor the reason behind the refusal to pay. As such, MOPSOC\nand Astrosoc look forward to being refunded, not as a 'goodwill gesture', but as a matter of principle.\nDan Salmons, MOPSOC President.\nNB Wood, Astrosoc Chairman.\nReply from Judith Hackney, Print Unit Manager:\nThe reason they were billed was attached to the invoice\nI sent them originally: Mr Salmons saw the artwork for\nboth cards before the printing was completed and he said\nthat it was fine. Mr Wood guillotined both sets of cards\nhimself and took them away seeming satisfied with the\nfinished jc. It was only the next day that Mr Salmons\nreturned, having changed his mind. The societies were only\nbilled for the materials used. The price may have been\nmore than I guessed because not all of the plate was taken\nup by other clubs and societies wanting a similar two colour\njob, hence they had to pay more for the plate they used\nthan is usual. It was well-publicised in last year's FELIX\nthat any clubs wanting membership cards printed for this\nacademic year should have them booked in and printed\nbefore the start of the academic year because of this very\nplate space problem! However, MOPSOC and AstroSoc\ncame to me in October. I could go on at great lengths about\nthe complexities of this Print Unit's time, costings and\navailability of printing but as you know we are tight on\nspace In FELIX.\nThe Print Unit does not have a monopoly: it merely offers\nclubs cheap, 'at cost' printing, there is no labour charge\nmade. I can only sum up by saying that if I could, I would\nhave charged the men concerned double purely for wasting\nthe Print Unit's and my time at the busiest and most\ntrouble-struck time of the year. It took nearly a day to set\nup and print those cards when the printer and I were\nworking an average 18 hours a day.\nReply from Chris Martin, FELIX Business Manager:\nI have seen the letter you have sent to the FELIX Editor\nabout the membership cards.\nLeaving aside the issue of whether you should pay, this\nbeing an issue for the Print Unit Manager, I must explain\nour action of going 'over your head' to the RCSU.\nThis happened when I contacted the RCSU Senior\nTreasurer, Dr Bignall, of the Physics Department, over\nanother matter. I mentioned in the conversation that there\nwere some outstanding bills from the RCSU, and he then\nasked me to send him a copy of all the outstanding bills.\nThis I did, and later I received a cheque for the amount.\nIt seems that any misunderstanding over the paying of the\nbill has arisen within the RCSU, with the breakdown of\nthe authorisation procedure. I don't think I have acted\nunreasonably in any way.\nAlso, since the invoice was sent, I have heard nothing\nat all from Mr Salmons or anyone else saying the invoice\nwould not be paid, so naturally I assumed that it would be.\nI would like to add that chasing overdue Print Unit bills\ntakes up, on average, half a day of my (unpaid) time a week, and these are bills on which we charge only cost\nprice, and this isn't work that I can say I enjoy.\nI look forward to your apology.\nPS. Does this really need to be carried out through the\nletter pages of FELIX? I can't imagine anyone but Mr\nSalmons or Mr Wood being the least bit interested.\nFELIX Friday February 19th198815 "

It's the most\noriginal horror film to come out in\nyears. Hire it if you can!\nThe Fly\nJeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, a scientist whose matter transporter\nsplices his genes with those of a common house fly, initiating a slow,\nterrifying metamorphosis, still loved\nby his faithful girlfriend. The video\nrelease of \"The Fly' is reputedly going\nto contain some scenes that were\nedited from the cinema version of the\nfilm. But it's not the gore that's important - it's the tragic love story\nthat makes this film so haunting and\nsad.\nBulletproof\nGary Busey, so good as the principle\nbad guy Mr Joshua in 'Lethal\nWeapon', stars in this pretty\nridiculous set-piece action mayhem\nmovie. It really stretches the\nimagination, requiring you to believe\nthat the PLO, a Soviet commando unit\nand a helicopter gun ship are moving\nfreely in a large wilderness slice of\nthe Mexican countryside. The plot is\nbare to say the least, and wholly\nimplausible, existing simply to\nsupport various badly executed action\nscenes. Give 'Bulletproof a miss. See\n'Robocop' instead for action and\nadventure.\nCrime Story\nFrom the director of couple of\nepisodes of 'Miami Vice' and the\nrec end y released 'West Side Story'\nrip off 'China Girl' comes a two hour\nsaga of slickly put together violence\nand 'Godfather' \u2014like wheeling and\ndealing and sub\u2014plot. This work\nattempts to do what most American\ncrime series don't: have violence, but\ntry to actually incorporate some\ncharacter is ation and plot\ndevelopment. It isn't as good as \"The\nGodfather', but is alright\nnevertheless, and is good\nentertainment if you're really hard up\nfor so em thing to hire.\nSINGLES STILL\n'Suede Head'-Morrisey\nIf you are still in a state of despair\nafter the demise of 'The Smiths',\ngrieve no more.\nRadio One DJ and general good egg\nJohn Peel has been previewing\nMorrissey's new single, and what an\nabsolute gem it is.\nThe A side, 'Suede Head', and one\nof the B side tracks, curiously titled\n'Hairdresser on Fire', are not a million miles away from 'Queen is\nDead' from 'The Smiths'. The other\nB side track, T Know Very Well How\nI Got My Name' is the most charming\ntrack on the disc, and bears more than\na passing resemblance to 'I Won't Share You' off the last 'Smiths' album\n'Strangeways Here We Come'.\nThe combination of Steven Street,\n\u2022 Vini Reilly and Morrissey promises\nto be equally good as \"The Smiths'.\nFingers crossed, the album should\nfollow soon. Watch this space!\n'Cold Sweat'-The\nSugarcubes\nIceland? Iceland! Well, 'ABBA' were\nfrom Sweden, after all, so is this a revival in the fortunes of the\nScandinavian rock industry? (Has\nScandinavia got a rock industry?)\nAnyway, that apart, the winners of\nthe prestigious Number One spot in\nJohn Peel's Festive Fifty follow up\nthe brilliant 'Birthday' with the\nequally brilliant 'Coldsweat'.\nNot as Cocteaus\u2014esque (What!? \u2014\nCharlie) as 'Birthday', 'Cold Sweat'\nis more direct, with a guitar sound\nlayered over a firm bass/drum beat,\nand that voice, so frail and yet so\npowerful.\nWith Gary Davis giving it a good\nairing on the National Number One\nradio station, this could be a chart\u2014bound\u2014sound soon.\nSo you see, there's more to Iceland\nthan Magnus Magnusson and\nvolcanoes!\nBrad Blundell\nI* PLAYING\n'Predator' (Cert. 18)\nThe blurb says something about 'it'\nhunting for sport and killing for\npleasure.

    "content": "UNDER MICRO by Steve Black\nBooks,\nEducation and\nthe Future of\nScience\nScientists neither read enough books\nnor write enough books; they will\nhave to start doing both if they want\nBritish science to survive, in a healthy\nstate, into the next century.\nWhy write books?\nScientists need to write books\nbecause, unless they do, people will\nthink that their time is spent simply\nenjoying themselves at tax payers'\nexpense. Scientists can no longer\nafford the luxury of assuming that the\nvalue of their work is self-evident to\nthe general public. They have to\njustify their existence; nobody else\nwill do it for them.\nThe public's interest in science is\ndifficult to measure, but appears to be\ndeclining. Fewer people seem to want\nto study sciences at school. Some\nsubjects are much worse than others.\nTake Chemistry, for example. ICI\nreckon they will run out of qualified\nchemists some time in the nineties (if\npresent trends continue).\nThere are two or three interlocking\nreasons for this. The supply of\nproperly qualified teachers is drying\nup. This is exacerbated by a chronic\nshortage of the money needed to fund\nproper practical chemistry teaching\n(chemistry is uniquely demanding of\nexperimental equipment). Also,\nchemistry has a terribly bad image\nproblem with the general public.\nSeveso, Bhopal and food additives\nhave done a lot of damage to the\nindustry's image. But it is ignorance\nthat is the biggest enemy. Call a food\nadditive Citric Acid or E321 and the\npublic will worry about its effects,\ncall it natural fruit extract (which is\nwhat it is) and they will rush to buy\nyour product.\nThe situation would not be so bad\nif chemists had explained their work\nto the public. But they have rushed\nheadlong into not doing that, with\nonly one or two recent exceptions.\nCompared with the screaming hordes\nof books on particle physics and\nastronomy, chemistry might as well\nnot exist as far as the general public\nis concerned. Without some drastic\naction chemistry will soon pay the\nprice.\nIt is strange that the most\neconomically useless sciences get the\nmost publicity. The chemical industry\n6\nis the most successful manufacturing\nindustry this country has (and it\nachieved this without government\nsupport through tariff barriers,\ndefence contracts or subsidies), but\nuniversity chemistry gets much less\nmoney than either astronomy or\nparticle physics, neither of which add\nanything to the nation's well being.\nI am not saying that it is never right\nto do expensive but useless research,\nbut such research is always a luxury.\nThe economy (whose taxes pay for\nCERN and the Isaac Newton\ntelescope) needs trained chemists; but\nit can do without astronomers (though\nit would be a poorer country\nintellectually if it didn't have any).\nThe point I am trying to make is\nthis: scientists have to tell people what\nthe point of their work is. They have\nto publicise how exciting research is,\nand what difference it makes to the\nman in the street. Chemistry is just\none example of where this has not\nbeen done, and the long term decline\nof the subject is now starting to\nbecome evident as a result. And that\nis not the worse thing; many people\nnow make completely irrational\ndecisions about chemistry (eg the food\nadditives scare) that are based on\nnothing more than a complete and\nutter ignorance of the subject. It could\nhappen to your subject, too, unless\nsomebody starts doing something\nabout it.\nWhy read books?\nHow can you write books, if you\nnever read them? Many scientists\nhave a bad habit of not being\ninterested in books. This is probably\nbecause of the way our school system\nworks. We encourage people to\nspecialise in either science or arts at\nA level, thereby doing our best to\nstop any interest in literature or\nlanguage among our future scientists.\nThis tends to prevent them becoming\neven adequately literate. This is a significant barrier when they need to\ntell other people about their work.\nHowever, all is not lost. Those of\nyou who gave up reading because you\nthought Charles Dickens was a boring\nold fart when you were forced to read\nhis books for English Literature Olevel, have still got a whole world of\ninteresting modern fiction to discover.\nBut good books about the real world\nare more fun. Unfortunately, most of\nthem are about that small portion of\nthe world dealt with by particle\nphysics, astronomy or David\nAttenborough.\nNevertheless, they are good books\nand they do demonstrate how best to\nget your message across to the general\npublic. You have to use lots of pretty\npictures and you have to avoid tedious\nbasic theory and use simple easy-to-visualise illustrations instead.\nBut scientists must keep up with\ntheir reading for another important\nreason: they need to know what is\ngoing on in the world. The time has\nlong since passed when we could\nafford to climb our ivory towers and\npursue programmes of research that\nwere of no earthly use to anyone.\nPure research has its place, but all\nscientists have a social duty to keep\nan eye out for practical applications\nof their work. They must be aware of\nwhere it might prove useful. And they\nhave to be able to justify to the public\nall the money that the government\nspends on them. If their work is\ndoomed to perpetual uselessness, then\nwhy not spend the money on the\nhealth service instead?\nThe future\nA good science book (or article) is\nwitty, has brilliant pictures and deals\nwith the sort of things that everyone\ncan appreciate. There has been\nprobably only one book of such a calibre in chemistry during the last\ntwo decades. As a result of this,\nnobody understands chemistry and\nfew want to be chemists.\nThe public have a right to know\nwhat scientists are up to. Scientists\nhave a duty to tell them. Chemistry\nis just one example of a subject whose\ncause has not been argued; many\nother subjects will also fall by the\nwayside if no one cares to tell the\npeople how interesting they are.\nNext week I'm going to review some\nof the best popular science books as\na demonstration of what there isn't enough of.\nFELIX\nFriday February 19th1988 Are Scientists scared of books?\n(Cartoon from Tiny Footprints and\nother drawings by B Kliban)\n\n"

At a recent\nNational Student Radio Association\nmeeting, the Chairperson Clare Kellet\nturned to him and quite without\nprompting said 'Do you like my\nbreasts?'. Nigel immediately gave his\nshocked reply T could give you a much better opinion if you took all\nyour clothes off.\n\u2022 IAN FRITH is losing his car\ntomorrow. Not content with\nterror ising Falmouth Keogh residents\nby driving at 70mph on the wrong\nside of the road to the local food\nwholesalers, he has lately taken to\ndriving to random towns in Britain.\nHis latest trip was to Peterborough,\ncovering the 100 miles in slightly\nmore than an hour. The last straw was\nwhen his match-making parents sent\ndown a Beccles beauty to see the\nsights of London with Ian. The\nterrified girl spent most of the trip\ncowering on the floor and now they\nare to give the car to Ian's younger\nbrother.\n\u2022 WHAT A SHAME it is that more\npeople haven't put their names up yet\nfor the three Union Sabbaticals.\nHowever, candidates for FELIX\nEditor come ten-a penny these days.\nIt is easy to spot these creatures. They\nare often seen parading around\nCollege in their designer FELIX\nsweatshirts and silly grins. Normal\nstudents are advised to avoid them at\nall costs!\n\u2022 CHAS JACKSON, our illustrious\nand terribly hard-working Honorary\nSecretary, told me a wonderful bit of\ngossip the other day. Last Saturday\nhis predecessor, David 'Gutman'\nColley went to a service station to use\nthe Esso Charge Card which had been\ngiven to him by his employers,\nMajestic Wine. Despite having been\ndriving the van for several months,\nhe put 32 litres of petrol into it.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nUnfortunately, it has a diesel engine.\nFunniest thing is, though, that\nGutman always claimed that it was the\ntransport side of his job that he really\nknew well!\nBY THIS DEED I the undersigned SIDNEY SPANKER of Thinbread Dormitory,\nPrinces Flowerbed, Cheapskate, DO HEREBY absolutely renounce and abandon\nthe use of my former first names and surnames of IAN ROBERT MALCOLM\nWHYGATE and in lieu thereof do assume as from the date hereof the first name\nand surname of SIDNEY SPANKER and in pursuance of such change of such\nfirst name and surname as aforesaid.

But who should he contact first. Oh, of course, the gutter\npress. He picked up the phone, three-five-one-five. 'Hello, is that the\nPhallix Office, this is Ian Whygate, I 've changed my name to Sidney\nSpanker.'\n'How interesting', said Largeamounts, thinking 'what apl on ker Whygate is'.\nWhygate knew Largeamounts wasn't interested so he hung up and\ntried someone else.\n'Hello, is that the Stun, I 've got a story for you...What do you mean\n'has it got sex in it?', well, sort of, you see I 've changed my name\nto Sidney Spanker...Great, on page 3 as well, thanks a lot.'\nSpanker had done it, fame at last, page 3 of the Stun.\nOver in the Surefield Fortress the Baron picked up his copy of the\nStun and turned to page 3. He was shocked to see the leader of his\ncitizens there. He called over John Secretary.\n'John, read me this story. I'm sure its about Cheapskate\u2014that's Ian Whygate's picture.'\nJohn read Derek the story.\n'What a brilliant idea', exclaimed Derek. Just what I need to enhance\nmy public standing and get me my knighthood or peerage.

Papers hadn't been\nup more than a few microseconds before Nige D Butcher had put his\nname up for citizen's leader and Cwis Media for Phallix Editor. Nige\nhad been suggested by John Chivalrous, who many people had\nthought would stand for Honorary Slave (Parties); but the only\ncandidate for this so far was Austin Morris, John's understudy on\nthe Parties Committee.\nA few days later Wilhebe Goodforacolumninch had also put his\nname up for Phallix Editor.\nThe first set of elections for the new clowns would also soon be\nhere. Standing for the leader of the Fundamentallaowsofnaturetesters\nwere Stephalump Snell and Muddly Williamslaughter (who just\nhappened to be a lumps of metal worshipper).

Will any fundamental lows of nature testers stand in the\nlumps of metal worshippers elections?\n' Why am I sitting in Normal's( the citizen's snack bar) writing this\ncrap?\nFind out the next episode the the Baron of Cheapskate.\n\u2022 MORE SCANDAL from the new\nUnion Housing Committee. At a recent thinly-attended meeting, the\nSelkirk and Tizard reps ganged\ntogether to force through a vote that\nthe Keogh part of Falmouth Keogh be\nthe hall to become postgraduate only.\nFalmouth Keogh retaliated by making\none of their sub wardens secretary to\nthe committee, which in addition to\nthe Falmouth Keogh Hall Rep,\nChairperson and Hon Sec made an\nuntouchable block vote of four in their\nfavour. Surprise, surprise at the next\nmeeting the decision was reversed,\nnominating Selkirk as the PG Hall-tobe. The College-run Student\nResidents Committee had the last\nlaugh, however, when it picked on\nWeeks Hall. The most recent message\nfrom my spy is that Selkirk and\nFalmouth Keogh were not speaking\nand running competing pancake day\nsessions\u2014Selkirk at \u00a31 for as much\nas you can eat, but FKH free!\n\u2022 THE NEXT sneaky move was for\nFKH to 'give' Selkirk a computer\nterminal, making Selkirk seem even\nmore suitable as a PG Hall.\n\u2022 INTERESTING FACT of the\nweek. Readers of the letters page may\nhave noticed a letter entitled\n'Sycophantic drivel' two weeks ago\nwhich went on and on about how\ngreat unknown entity Spencer Lane\nwas. This was followed last week by\na letter from Spencer himself wanting\nto know why the letter was given such\na title. I can now reveal that it was\nin fact titled Sycophantic drivel\nbecause the original letter writer,\ncalling himself David Leigh, Physics\n1, was none other than Spencer.\nFELIX bod s smelt a rat when the\nletter was first received. Further\ninvestigations revealed that there was\nno David Leigh in Physics. It then\ntranspired that Spencer's middle\nnames are, in fact, Leigh David.\nInteresting, eh?\n\u2022 WHAT A WALLY Ian Howgate\nis! Monday saw saturation coverage\nin the Sun, on Radio 1 and IRN of\n'wacky' Ian's change of name\nto Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nSuitably they\nput his picture\non page 3 of the\nSun. This made\nthe Union Bar\nstaff very happy\nbecause it gave them the opportunity\nto display a photocopy of the whole\nof page 3 in the bar.\nChris Jones\nWACKY Ian FELIX Friday February 19th19885 "

Conditions\nwere perfect, mild, a little sun and\nmost importantly no rain.\nUnfortunately the scores show the\nstandard of play was far from perfect\nwith out first pair, Mark Lavelle and\nKen Cheung, winning the only rubber\nagainst Queen's third pair. Queen's first pair was strong but our lack of\nmatch practice prevented more\nsuccess against the other two pairs.\nNext weekend sees the match of IC\nl sts VI against Queen's1st VI. So,\nwith favourable weather, sweet\nrevenge is called for.\nRUGBY\nRCS A Team\u201416\nQueen Mary College 2nds \u201414\nDue to recent problems in raising a second side, RCS Rugby has now\nformed a temporary A side which\ndraws from the full RCS squad.\nOnce the visitors had arrived the A team began to get in the mood, helped\nby a rousing display by captain\nPertbucks. Such was the enthusiasm\nthat Bardiver-Dobson taped back his\nvulcan ears. The game started off at\na fast pace and it took a while for RCS\nto settle. Playing with the wind, much\nground was made with Bryn's boot\nwhich spurred on the forwards who\ndominated the loose ball.\nTen minutes into the game, out of\nthe blue, Queen Mary's scored and\nconverted a try. Not deterred by this\nRCS put the pressure on and halfway\nthrough the half their hard work paid\noff when Spike Boyce went over. This\ntry was magnificently converted by\nStickman Magee.\nThe second half began badly\u2014the\nhalf-time lead of 12-6 was soon\nwhittled down to a1214 deficit after\ntwo quick tries by Mary's. To add\ninjury to insult, halfway into the\nsecond period, O 'Donut had to leave\nthe field with a cream cake problem.\nLuckily we had super-sub J Clayton\nto come on.\nAs the match entered the closing\nstages blood began to boil. Under the\ninfluence of debut boy Bob Coutes in\ntandem with Mouth Manning the pack\nwent from strength to strength and\nwere repeatedly within a few feet of\nthe line. The game climaxed 7\nminutes into injury time when M Fanshawe collected a poorly cleared\nball and touched down in the corner.\nSeconds later the whistle went and\nRCS recorded a memorable victory.\nThe racing season is here at last.\nSerious training runs will set off from\nBeit Arch at 2pm on Wednesday\nafternoons starting this week; note\nhowever that the Sunday morning\nruns shall remain largely\ntouring orientated as usual.

The match\nstarted and soon the A,B and Ladies\nsquads were in deep trouble,\ndramatically losing their first games\nwith only the C squad maintaining\nsome pride by destroying their Kent\ncounterparts (fine performances from\nBen Surtees, Cott Waye, Simon\nPhillips and Martin Morris).\nAlthough the B team shaded their\nsecond game and the C squad carried\non with their impressive form, the A and Ladies teams continued to\nflounder and by the start of the third\ngames, IC faced the devastating\nprospect of a humiliating defeat.\nIt was at this point that the true\nwith the ten-mile time trial in\nNottingham. It is hoped that we will\nbe able to field as tong team not only\nin this event, but also in the\nsubsequent trial. Full details of all\nevents will follow shortly. In the\nmeantime, anyone interested should\ncontact me (Andy Major) through the\nPhysics pigeonholes, or come and see\nme in B501, the Bessemer Building.\nAndy Major, Physics 3.\nspirit of IC shone through. Instead of\nheads dropping, the squad captains\nspurred their team-mates on for one\nlast super-human effort. The C squad\nfinished their campaign the way they\nhad started by white-washing their\nopponents and, with the 'B Boys'\nrallying superbly to clinch their\ncontest (excellent scores from Paul\nYoung, Chi Chan and Steve\nRussell\u2014whose 197 contained eight\nstrikes!), four match points were in\nthe bag for IC.\nUnfortunately, the A and Ladies\nsquads were by now in so much\ntrouble that four points were\nguaranteed for Kent. This left the\nremaining two match points resting on\nthe result of the A squad's final game.\nRising to the challenge Garman\nWong, Roger Hollamby and new boy\nBruce Nichols all fired in scores of\n150+, leaving the skipper to\nheroically secure the game (and a55 match result) in a nail-biting last\nframe 'bowl off with his opposite\nnumber. A fine IC Performance.\nHOCKEY\nEric's difficult\nballs\nIC 3rds XI0 Old Creightonians 3rds XI\u20140\nThe first half was a very exciting 45\nminutes with everyone slipping over\nin the mud. Steve Burton got very\nclose to scoring. He was directly in\nfront of the goal and missed. He\nblamed it on the ball dropping into a div it. Spencer stood about on the\nwing, hitting the ball about, and\noccasionally giving the ball away.\nEric stopped some difficult balls. The\nend of the second half was marked by\nShaun saving the ball with his box\u2014\nOw! The second half was just as\neventful, Vish played with himself\nmost of the time, dribbling only a short distance before losing the ball.\nNB. The 2nds also drew 0-0.\nIC Ladies\u20141\nKings\u20141\nThis is the first ladies hockey match;\nto be played for three weeks due to\nthe weather. Both teams attacked, I defended and stick tackled well. The I breakthrough came twenty minutes\ninto the first half when Kings struck\na short corner well, good reflex action j was however seen by Emma Pownall j as she got out of the way of the ball1 before it hit the backboard. Not to be j out-done IC replied when Sarah j Hodgson took advantage of the free |\nhit to put the ball across the goal\nmouth, Penny Otway stopped the ball,!\ndrew the goalkeeper towards her\nbefore deftly flicking the ball left\nwhere Suzanne Astington made no\nmistake as she scored the equal ising goal. After this the game returned to\nmedio c racy. Many thanks to Mark Rayfield for\numpiring.\nIC Ladies\u20141\nWye College\u20140\nThis was a quarter-final match of the j University of London Colleges plate j competition. IC with an under strength side again had a very positive attitude.\nThe game again saw play at both ends\nof the pitch. However good defensive j play by Emma Pownall and midfield\nmay by Mary Faldon ensured Wyei\ndid not score. A flash of brilliance by I Sandra Rofe produced the only goal\nof the match.\nThanks to Deb's friend Sarah, for\nplaying.\nBowling frenzy\n12 Friday February 19th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Union Ijjf Tp M'f The Great Education\nReform Bill (GERBill-ged d it?) GERBill is a huge piece of legislation\nthe Government have put forward for\nconsultation to be revised then passed\nand implemented by 1990. It's aim is\na large scale reform and reorganisation of the entire education\nsystem in this country. It is being\nopposed by the opposition parties, the\nNUS, ULU, and Imperial College\nUnion Council on several grounds.\nThe Bill generally removes the\nindependence of the universities and\ninstitutions and places control over\nfunding and policy into the hands of\ncentral government and industry.\nWhilst not specifically mentioning\nstudent unions, there are grave\nimplications in the way universities\nwill be funded as to our survival.\nThe Bill abolishes the University\nGrants Committee (UGC) which\npresently distributes all funding to the\nuniversity sector, and replaces it with\na body consisting of half industrialists\nand half academics called the\nUniversity Funding Council (UFC).\nThe Government will have the power\nto appoint members of the UFC thus\nmaking such positions political. The\nUFC will only have the power to\nadvise the Secretary of State on\nfunding.\nPolytechnics will be taken out of the\ncontrol of local education authorities\nand placed under the UFC and central\ngovernment. Each department in the\nuniversities will, each year, have to\nsubmit a bid for the limited funds\navailable based on student numbers,\nuseful research done, and success rate\nin the department.\nThe implications of this are\nfrightening. Universities will be\nforced to push their 'best'\ndepartments and courses forward in\nthe bid for funding. The role of\nindustry in the decision-making\nprocess could lead to a neglect of the\narts and humanities and also the less\napplied side of science and\nmathematics. The bill takes away\nnearly all the autonomy previously\nenjoyed by the universities, placing\ncontrol over courses in the hands of\ncentral government.\nStudent unions are not mentioned\nanywhere in the entire document. It\nis assumed that SU funding will be\nplaced by the colleges into their\ncentral administration budget in the\nbid for resources. Colleges are more\nlikely to cut spending on student\nunions than their own administration.\nAfter all, student unions produce no\nuseful research, no industry contracts,\nand attract no foreign students.\nThe NUS are opposing this bill with\npetitions, postcards, a one day strike\nand a large rally in Hyde Park on\nFebruary 27. UL U have voted to\nsupport this campaign so we are\ninvited to attend the rally under the\nULU banner (12 noon, assemble\nEmbankment). IC Union is planning\nan independent action in conjunction\nwith the Association of University\nTeachers (AUT) and will be\ndiscussing this at an Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting next Tuesday.\nNeil Motteram,\nICU External Affairs Officer.\nICEnts\npresent:\nBasil who?\nWell I guess you're all wondering\nwhy there are loads of bright pink\nposters all over the place, so I'm going to tell you straight. On Friday\n19th February we have a rather\nspectacular line-up in the Lounge. At\n9.15pm Loves Young Nightmare take\nthe stage, they are a new pop band\nwho just signed a mega deal with IRS\nrecords. Then at 10.15pm John\nShuttleworth will be on stage, some\nof you might remember his earlier\nstage name of Jilted John ('Gordon\nis a Moron' etc.). Finally at about\n11pm we have the amazing Bass\nDance performing, they are an\nexcellent reggae band featuring Basil\nGabbidon, the ex-Steel Pulse lead\nguitarist. All this will be interspersed\nwith a disco and drinks, so at \u00a31 a ticket (\u00a31.50 on the door) you can't go wrong. The doors open at 9pm and\nplease be prompt or you'll miss the\nfun. See you there.\nFree\nholiday!\nNo joke.. .A week in Grenoble, with\na party every night.\n'Eh! Where's the catch?'\nWell there isn't one, except that of\nthe thousands of applications\nexpected, only two can go.\n'What do they do in the daytime?'\nMeet students from other countries,\nlook at industry and meet some of the\npeople who run the industries\nindividually.\n'What\u2014every day?'\nWell, no. Wednesday is skiing and\nSaturday is free for sports or\nsightseeing...or recovering ready for\nthe all night party on Saturday\nevening...about 2000 people will be\nthere!\nThe 1988 International Week is being\nheld at the INPG in Grenoble very\nsoon!

Run\nby the Football Club and billed\ninevitably as the Valentines Ball, the\nevent offering value for money.\nA main element of any ball is the\nlive entertainment. This year the\nclient el were spoilt for choice.\nOpening the ball were Just 4 Kicks,\na Mary's band singing Smiths'\nnumbers and the like. With a good\nfollowing in the establishment, this\nproved a popular group. Followed by\na burst of Psychotherapy in the form\nof the Viva Beavers, the main band\nwere on stage by about half past\ntwelve.\nHeavens Above are a rising band\nwith many London club gigs and a strong following in the Medical\nSchool. This stems from the fact that\ntheir old bass player left the group to\ncommence a course in Medicine at\nMary's, thus a group of people have\nbeen exposed to the band and its\npopularity has spread.\nMr Ian Howgate and Chas Brereton\nmade guest appearances at the Ball.\nApparently, Chas had to be taxied\nback to IC completely out of his skull.\nA little bird tells me that on his four\nvisits here, each time he has been\nincapacitated and had to be escorted\nhome. Ian had swapped his pink bow\ntie for a pre-made black leather bow\ntie which I suppose is an\nimprovement. They did seem to enjoy\nthe Ball which can only bode well for\nthe future, as the future must lie\nthrough integration to remove all the\nmalicious rumours.\nA wine bar with a large range of\nwines and waiter service appeared at\nthis ball and was a most welcome\naddition to the usual Pimms, cocktail\nand standard bars. The disco was full\nuntil 3.30am with revellers dancing\nthe night away, and by 4.30am the\nfinal party-goers had left leaving the\nmammoth task of clearing up all the\nglasses, bottles and, not least,\nremoving all the decorations that\ntransform the building quite\nmagnificently.\nExtraordinary Union\nGeneral Meeting\nto discuss the proposed Education\nReform Bill, its consequences and the\nUnion's action\nTuesday 23rd February\n1.00pm in the JCR\n4 Friday February 19th1988 FELIX\n\n"

Several posters have been\nspotted announcing that the\n'Collegiate Association for the\nResearch of Principles (CARP)'\nwill be meeting students between\n15th and 21st February.\nFollowing this, members of the\ncult were seen trying to recruit\nstudents coming into College\nalong Exhibition Road and\nyesterday they had set up a recruitment base outside the\nMechanical Engineering\nDepartment.\nFollowers of the cult have been\nbanned from College premises by\nCollege Security. Security Officer Mr\nTerry Briley told FELIX that he was\nonly able to escort members of CARP\noff College premises and that he could\ndo little if they set up a base on the\npavement outside College. It was only\nin the power of the police to move\nthem on if they were causing an\nobstruction or nuisance.

    "content": "FOOTBALL\nDomination\nIC l st4 Goldsmiths 1st \u20144\nIC started well and began to dominate\nthe game. IC were unlucky not to\nscore twice early on in the game.\nSimon Cole made a run to the edge\nof the box, beating two or three\nplayers, and then shot, the ball hit the\nunderside of the crossbar and bounced\nout. The other chance was a goal mouth scramble but the goalie\nmanaged to smother the ball.\nIC's first goal came when Nigel\nCollier tried to put a pass through to\nAdam Thomas, but a Goldsmith's defender intercepted it and\ninadvertently passed it back to Collier\nwho struck it with his left foot into\nthe back of the net. The second goal\ncame from new boy Pip Peel who ran\non to a long cross field pass from M Bradley and put the ball wide of the\ngoalie to make it 2-0.\nThe lead was strengthened when N Collier received the ball and skillfully\nbeat the defender but before shooting\nhe waited for the beaten defender to\nrecover and then beat him again. Still\nnot feeling ready to shoot he gave the\nsame defender yet another chance to\nreprieve himself, but Collier turned\nhimself once more and mustered up\nthe confidence to shoot.\nThe second half did not have so\nmuch to offer from IC's point of\nview. Goldsmiths started to re-capture\nsome of their form which has put\nthem at the top of the league. It was\nnot long before the score was 3-2.\nGoldsmiths were going from strength\nto strength but IC hit back with a far\npost leader from Collier. But\nunfortunately this did not turn the\ngame around. With IC looking\nincreasingly more tired Goldsmiths\nmade the final score 4-4.\nIC 3rd XI2 LSE 2nd XI1 This game saw IC 3rds needing a result, both for their own league\nambitions and to help the 2nds who\nwere worried about second placed\nLSE's challenge to their\nchampionship hopes. The game began\nin the worse possible way for IC,\nplaying into a strong wind they\nconceded a goal from LSE's very first\nattack. Most teams would have\nbelieved that it wasn't going to be\ntheir day, but the IC team gritted their\nteeth and began to play their best\nfootball of the season. Paul Olden and\nDarren Bolland were superb in\nmidfield and IC really began to attack.\nThe equalise r came after twenty\nminutes\u2014a great ball out to the right\nwing from Paul Olden saw Darren\nBolland cross perfectly to Chris\nMorris who rifled home a powerful\nleft foot shot. IC carried on playing\nwell, but were downhearted to see\nMark Radley carried off ten minutes\nbefore half-time after a nasty\nchallenge. With no sub IC were down\nto 10 men and LSE fancied their\nchances, even though IC hung on until\nhalf-time with the scores level. The\nsecond half started with the wind\nagainst IC's backs and for the first\ntwenty minutes keeper Dave Martin\nhard ley had a touch as IC mounted\nattack after attack. Eventually the\npressure had to pay, Paul Neville\nworked the ball across the LSE box\nto Neil Leonnard, who's first time\npass put Darren Bolland through and\na perfect finish put IC 2-1 up. IC\nrelaxed a bit after gaining the lead and\nLSE mounted some pressure, Ivan\nParkin was superb (marking 2 men\nmost of the time due to Mark Radley's injury), and Chris Budgen, Kevin\nGraves and Mark Woodgate all\ndefended so well that LSE never\nreally caused any problems.

    "content": "IN I ews\nRecord IC computer thefts\nThere has been a recent spate of\ncomputer thefts throughout the\nCollege. Since the third week of\nJanuary more than ten pieces of\ncomputer equipment have\ndisappeared, most of the thefts\noccur ing in the Departments of\nChemistry and Biochemistry.\nThe latest was an Amstrad\ncomputer and keyboard from\nChemical Engineering, which was\nstolen sometime between 7.30pm and\n10.15pm on Wednesday. The\ncomputer is believed to be holding\nabout six months' of a student's thesis, which is not stored elsewhere.\nTerry Briley of College Security\nsaid that this rate of theft is not usual\nand appealed for anyone who has any\ninformation to contact Security on int\nBaker backs down\n3370 during offices hours or 3372 out\nof hours. He urged computer users to\n'insist that stuff is clamped down' and\nalways to lock computer room doors\nwhen the computers are unattended.\nAll but one of the computers were\ncarried out through doors which were\nleft unlocked.\nThe largest theft was worth about\n\u00a37500 and was carried out between\n8pm and 9pm one evening last week\nin Chemistry. When asked whether he\nthought it likely that the equipment\nwould be recovered, Mr Briley was\nnot optimistic. The computers are\n'highly marketable', he explained.\nThe Scenes of Crimes Officer has\ninspected the relevant rooms but was\nunable to find any identifiable marks.\nMr Kenneth Baker, the Government's Education Secretary, has reiterated\nthat the Government would never\ninterfere in the detailed work of the\nnew Universities Funding Council\n(UFC). This follows a demand made\nby university vice-chancellors to the\nstanding Commons Committee which\nis considering the Education Reform\nBill in detail. Originally Mr Baker\nproposed that the UFC would have\ncontrol over money raised from non-government sources. He has now\nbacked down, telling MPs that the\nUFC would just control government\nfunding.\nMr Baker denied that sinister\ngovernment motives lay behind his\nproposals. He wants the new UFC to\nmake its own decisions on allocation\nof funds and advise him on the\nfunding needs of higher education,\nbut without acting as a lobby for more\nmoney.\nMany Vice Chancellors have\nexpressed their fear that the Great\nEducation Reform Bill could lead to\nGovernment abuse of their new\npowers.

New technology\noffers the possibility of reducing those\n'endearing typographical garbles' and\n'grey mists of pictures', even at the\ncost of upsetting readers for whom\nsuch i dio syn croci es all go to form a 'flawed and fu d gy friend'. More\ncynically, however, the redesign is\nseen by some as a rear guard action\nagainst the loss of student readers to\nthe Independent. Though the\nGuardian still boasts more readers\naged under 35 than any other quality\ndaily newspaper and perhaps,\nconceited ly, the best educated\nreadership in the national press.\nBefore discussing the changes\nperhaps I should, at this point, confess\nthat I am not infact a Guardian\nreader. More by an accident of history\nthan choice it was always, whisper it\nlow, the Telegraph that lay in the\nrange of my young inquisitive ev\nes.\nAt school in general studies, the\nGuardian was branded as slightly left\nof centre and thus to be read with\nsome degree of care. As a result it\nreceived only the occasional curious\nglance, at the risk of facing some\nimagined ideological assault/\nindoctrination. To this background of\npre-conceived thoughts, I was very\ndisappointed to finally read the\nnewspaper in earnest.\nVisually the Guardian has all the\nappearance of a Sunday newspaper.\nThe title appears in two modern-'\nlooking though different typefaces, no\ngl j tj Want fr fa't tr t gun tft fan. fSf te \"Brian t fit j it rr Cuar at a ii; MANCHESTER GUARDIAN THE GUARDIAN THE GUARDIAN\ndoubt this has some aesthetic appeal\nbut it looks out of place. In the articles\nthe use of dropped capitals and lines\nunderneath stories 'give the reader a clear indication of where to start and\nfinish a story'\u2014a fact a reader would\nhopefully realise without such clues!\nNonetheless these methods make the\npage much more organised and\nuncluttered than previously, giving\nthe overall effect of a European\nnewspaper. The lines, however, have\nnot had a favourable representation in\nthe trial-by-letters page currently in\nprogress.\nAlso under attack is the tendency\nof the layout design to incorporate\nwhite spaces rather than the more\ncommon practice of packing every\npage full of print. Though a deliberate\nattempt to promote clarity, this does\nsometimes give the impression that\nthe headline does not fit. As a similar\nmeasure, the number of stories on the\nfront page has been reduced.\nOther changes include the\nintroduction of a second section which\nin contrast to the Times' equivalent is\nnot of a set format, having a daily\ntopic such as Review, Education and\nComputing. While increasingly\ncumbersome to read on the train, this\nmove may well serve to alleviate\nthose breakfast table squabbles for the\npaper. The TV page finds a more\naccessible location on the back page\nof this section, though the sports\npages are still uniquely concealed in\nthe depths of the main section. While\nthe crossword is again given pride of\nplace on the back page.\nAlthough the letters page reveals a fairly mixed response, there would\nseem to be a general feeling of\nacceptance (provided those letters\nprinted can be considered to be a representation of those received). By\nintroducing such varied changes there\nis bound to be something to irritate\nand impress everyone. And, finally\nhaving the leader page at the back is\na real innovation!\nSun Reader, aged 21%.\nFELIX Friday February 19th19883 "

    "content": "Night of the Living Dead\nThe first in George Romero's now\nclassic trilogy of zombie films. It was\noriginally made in black and white, j and has been newly colour is ed for its\nvideo release. The film itself is the\nsort that you get out just to laugh at\nhow bad it is. The colour is ation is\ndiabolical\u2014they've made the zombies\ngreen, for some bizarre reason.\nRomero's original idea was to show\nthe breakdown of society due to attack\nfrom the outside\u2014in this case, the\nreturn to life of the dead. No reason\nis offered for this reanimation\u2014which\nmakes the whole concept more\nfrightening, because consequently\nnothing can be done.\nAll in all, unless you have some T special interest in this film, don't bother getting it. Try to see Dawn of\nthe Living Dead or Day of the Living\nDead instead\u2014they were originally\nshot in colour, had better budgets, and\nare very good indeed.\nSpyros, a retired schoolteacher, meets\nup with a young girl hitch hiker, ail d they travel on together, sharing both\naccommodation and food, and\nnothing happens between them; they\nenjoy a platonic relationship. But one\nnight she flaunts her indifference to\nhim by bringing a casual pick-up\nback to their room and making love\nin Spyros' presence. They separate\nwithout farewells, but once again run\ninto each other. Spyros initiates their\nreunion by driving his van through the\nfront window of the restaurant where\nshe is having dinner, and she willingly\nleaves with him. They have a brief but\npassionate affair, which seems to\nliberate Spyros. But the next night she\ntells him that their relationship is\nover, and in the day Spyros goes to\none of his beehive sites and in\nimpotent despair scatters his hives,\nand falls to the ground in grief.\n'You have to begin to lose your\nmemory . . . to realise that memory\nis what makes our lives. Our memory\nis our coherence, our reason, our\nfeeling, even our action. Without it,\nwe are nothing.'\nThe quote is from Bunuels, but it\nfits Greek film maker Thodoros\nAngelopoulos' new work per fec dy. It\ncharts a doomed encounter between\ntwo generations for whom the past\nmeans everything and nothing. The\nfilm is filled with images of bleakness\nand isolation: it starts with a winter\nwedding, moves on to a long,\nbrooding tracking shot of Spyros\nwalking by a river, and so on. Spyros\ngoes on a trip inspecting the bee hives\nhe inherited from his father; it is a journey into his past, punctuated by'\na soundtrack of extracts from the\ndiary of a previous journey, and\nhopes for the future. Except that for\nSpyros there is no future, because the\npresent makes no connections with the\npast he knows.\nIn the world of 'The Bee Keeper'\nthe past can only be a memory for\npeople of a fading generation. But\nmemory cannot itself sustain a future.\nThe beehives need periodically to be\nrenewed, or moved to a better\nposition.\n'The Bee Keeper' is a good film -Marcello Mastroianni is excellent as\nSpyros, as is Nadia Mourouzi as the\ngirl. The story does fumble around a little bit in the middle, but otherwise\nis excellent entertainment for the;\nmeaningful film buffs. If you're still\nnot sure about it, it'll probably crop}\nup on Channel 4 sometime next year.\n8 Friday February 19th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Apreposterous suggestion, you may say. Quite ludicrous. But before you dismiss\nit as pure fiction, consider the following facts.\nThe rate of information growth is doubling every five years. Currently, 6000 new\nscientific articles are published every week.\nAn explosion of facts and figures shattering the dreams of anyone hoping to\nbecome a Jack-of-all-trades. Indeed, being the master of just one is now a race\nwhere the finishing line keeps moving.\nSkills and knowledge that may have taken years to acquire can be out of date\nalmost overnight.\nThink of the ship designers in the north-east who have had to turn their\nhand to designing oil rigs.\nThe plant breeders who have had their world turned upside down by the advent\nof genetic-engineering.\nThe textile designers who have had their crayons replaced by computer keys.\nFormal qualifications on their C.V's, though important, would have given little\nindication of their capacity to accept and adapt to change.\nWILL TODAY'S GRADUATE BE WEARING A DIFFERENT I Of course, if we expect people to have a more flexible, adaptable outlook on\nwork, we must also expect the same of their employers.\nSo companies must be prepared to do more than just give time off for\noccasional conferences. They must also allow time off to attend business schools\nand retraining courses. And maybe more.\nSome companies do already. But should we follow the example of countries\nlike Sweden where mid-career breaks of several years are not uncommon? In fact, is\nit time we reappraised our attitude towards career patterns entirely?\nTraditionally, the long serving employee has been held up as the shining example.\nAnd, of course, many years of experience in a company can be invaluable.\nBut in today's fast changing world perhaps we should look more favourably on\nfrequent job changes and regard them as the need to face fresh challenges.\nThat, in itself, is a challenge that business may soon have to face.\nIndeed, in our view, training, or lack of it, is very often at the root of many\ncompanies' staffing difficulties.\nYet, sadly some firms still see training as a side issue when compared with,\nsay, providing plant and finance.\nAccording to the latest (1985) MSC figures, the average company spends a mere 0.15% of its turnover on training.\nAs for ourselves, this year training will cost us some 10% of our income. It's a sizeable sum. But it's one we would not spend unless \u00a7\u00a3\u00a3\u00a7|S Ernst& Wh in ney we knew it would repay us fully in the years to come. ^ H^ ff iS S^^ IF YOU LIKE THE SOUND OF ERNST & WHINNEY CONTACT MICHEL KNIGHT AT THE ADDRESS ABOVE.\n\n"
