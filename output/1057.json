Not that you'd know it, mind, since\nthis release is as equally weird and unpredictable\nas their previous excursions. Success has made\nquite a habit of eluding North London's most\neminent techno-heads, despite a number of nifty\nclub records and an awesome live show.\nUnfortunately, this record is not going to help\nmatters.\nI'm not saying that it isn't any good. It's just\nthat Bandulu refuse to compromise; to temper\ntheir dark, minimalist techno for the record buying public. Tunes are a big no-no with melodies so\nunderstated as to be almost unnoticeable. If\nyou're a fan of bleep y, drifting, ambient techno-s capes, then this is most definitely for you.\nThe opener, 'Selah', is the only remotely\ncatchy track. It's dreamy, mood-evoking and just\nplain brilliant. 'Parasite' outdoes even the masterful Aphex Twin to deliver a smooth, deeply textured melody-less ambience. The rest of the\nalbum follows the usual Bandulu themes, namely\nstrong dub by bass-lines with weird electronic\nrhythms gliding over the top.\nBasically, this is an album which techno-b of fins will love. Your average techno fan, on the\nother hand, will love a few of the tracks but ultimately end up getting bored with the 'filler' ones.\nTechnically this album is excellent, but if Bandulu\nare to achieve any tii ing approaching the success\nof, say, Underworld, then they'll have to give us a few more hooks to hang on to.

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY MAY 17TH1996 NEWS\nIC favoured\non overseas\n'whitelist'\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nIC's \u00a313.8 million income from\nforeign students was put under\nthe spotlight this week with the\nrevelation that some countries\nare creating 'white lists' of\nfavoured British Colleges.\nThe Education Editor of\nThe Times, John O 'Lcary, broke\nthe story early this week. He\nconfirmed to Felix that Imperial\nis on the exclusive list of colleges\nto whom Singapore will send\nmedical students. It has also\nbeen confirmed that all\nImperial's degrees are accepted\nby Singapore's Professional\nEngineering Board.\nProf Alan Swanson, Pro\nRector (Educational Quality),\nsuggested that Imperial's exalted\nposition might in part be due to\nthe long running activities of the\nCollege's International Office.\nTheir efforts ensure that\nImperial is represented at all\nmajor Recruitment Pairs that the\nBritish Council runs worldwide.\nAt present approximately\n23% of Imperial's student population originate from abroad.\nMalaysia, Singapore and Sri\nLanka are the three best represented countries, with over six\nhundred students.\nThe Pro Rector defended\nthe relatively high number of\noverseas students saying that\n\"The international experience is\npart of why people come here.\"\nHe suggests that the increase in\noverseas students is likely to\ncontinue with 30% being a \"reasonable\" upper figure.\nThis means that the valuable overseas income will\ncontinue to grow, potentially\ntopping \u00a320 million by the end\nof the decade. This was the first\nyear that income from c wer seas students surpassed that from\nhome students. With this significant source of money dependent on the approval ol foreign\ngovernments, Prof Swanson\nadmits that he would be\nconcerned, \"if we were crossed\noff anybody's list\".\n\u00a340m Albert Hall windfall\nBY NAT BARB\nPopular science shows, sports\nevents and a British Orchestra\nWeek will feature in the new\nprogramme of the Royal Albert\nHall, following its \u00a340 million\naward from the National\nLottery Fund.\nAnnouncing the award on\nTuesday, the Hall's Chief\nExecutive, Patrick Deuchar,\nexplained that the money will go\ntowards a \u00a358 million refurbishment project which will take\naround eight years to complete.\n\"We want to restore and upgrade the fundamental fabric of\nthis Grade I listed national\nmonument for audiences and\nartists alike\", he explained.\nMr Deuchar intends to\nbalance the range of events at the\nRoyal Albert Hall, but with the\nnew facilities he hopes to be able\nto stage an additional 60 shows\neach year (at the moment there\nare just over 300). The original\nremit of the Hall was: \"to\npromote the arts and the\nsciences\", and talks are underway\nwith the Science Museum to\nbring in science shows. This\nmove follows the great success of\nthe recent talk given by Stephen\nHawking. Mr Deuchar is also\nconsidering expanding into sporting events such as gymnastics and\nbasketball and also dance and\nopera.\nThis is award represents yet\nanother massive lottery grant to a London institution, though Mr Deuchar though does not feel\nthat only Londoners will benefit.\nHe views the Albert Hall as \"the\nnation's village hall\", and envisages that events such as the\nproposed British Orchestra Week\nwill bring all of Britain together.\nDevelopment work is\nalready underway with the\nupgrading of seats in the balcony\nto dress circle standards resulting\nin the hall being shut for a month. The other most noticeable cf ian ges will be a pedestrian\npiazza right around the building,\nand a rebuilt South Porch which\nshould match the other three\ngrand entrances. A huge underground service yard beneath the\nSouth Steps will be constructed\nto remove traffic from around\nthe building. Other plans include\nthe building of additional bars\nand restaurants to relieve the\npresent overcrowding.\nIt is hoped that disruption\ndue to the building works will be\nkept to a minimum with only two\nadditional closures. The first will\noccur in 2001 to revamp the\nstage, with the other closure at\nthe end of the works to clean the\norgan (at a cost of \u00a32 million) and\nto refurbish the interior of the\nHall. The \u00a3 i8 million balance\nbetween the cost of the project\nand the lottery grant will be met\nfrom Royal Albert Hall trading\nsurpluses.\n1996 is the Royal Albert\nHall's125 th Anniversary. This\n\u00a340 million 'birthday present'\nshould allow it to maintain its\nimage as one of the nation's most\npopular venues well into the next\ncentury.\nNews in brief\nUnusual interest in AGM\nFilling the ICU officer vacancies\nlooks set to be a simpler than\nusual task this year. As Felix\nwent to press, the positions of\ntransport officer and Haldane\nBook and Record Buyer were the\nonly ones lacking candidates. The\nelections are due to take place at\nthe Annual General Meeting\nscheduled for 12.15pm today.\nThe position of Council Chair is\nhotly contested, with both\nC& GU President, Sarah Thomas,\nand Vice President, Duncan\nTindall, standing for the position\nas well as the Royal College of\nScience Academic Affairs\nOfficer, Matt Szyndel.\nIC 'in hock to military'\nImperial has been singled out in\nfigures released by the Campaign\nfor Nuclear Disarmament investigating the extent of Ministry of\nDefence involvement in research\ncontracts in London.\nThe report indicates that the\nvast majority of IC departments\nreceive MoD funding, whose\ncontracts are supposedly worth\n\u00a37million to the university.\nAlleging that London University\nis 'in hock to the military', C ND also reveal that the American\nGovernment sponsor $3.5million worth of military research.\nDisciplinary\nA Royal School of Mines student\nfaces disciplinary action at a meeting with ICU licensees this\nmorning. The student is alleged\nto have been violent and abusive\nto the ICU President, Sarah\nWhite, and a union steward on\nthe evening of the City and\nGuilds' Carnival on 3 May.\n\n"

Her voice was vaguely familiar\nfrom the winsome, coffee-table angst of\nEverything But The Girl, but that duo still passed\nme by until Todd Terry's recent house re-working\nof 'Missing', a song which became their biggest hit\nand showed how well Tracey's voice was suited to\ndance-influenced beats. Then came the v Val king Wounded' single...\nUndoubtedly the highlight of this album, the\ntitle track is an absolute classic. The heart-rending\nlyrics are perfectly matched by their accompaniment of fractured beats, hard-edged samples and\nsumptuous, flowing strings. This is provided by\nSpring Heel Jack, first-rate exponents ofthe more\nlaid-back style of drum 'n' bass. But this song is\nnot just another remix - EBTG have gone Junglist!\nWell, not quite. There are a couple of\nacoustic ballads here, which are not really my\nscene but are still excellent and will appeal to the\nold fans. It is the break-beat tracks that really\nshine through, though. Ben Watt, the other half of\nEBTG, turns out strong melodies and his loops\nand breaks complement Tracey's astounding\nvocals to bring together a brilliant package.\nIronically, the weakest tune here is the Todd\nTerry remix of the new single, Wrong'. The finely poised original is ruined by a bland house re-working, a blatant attempt to cash in on 'Missing'.\nIt even starts the same way!\nApart from that, this album is simply mag-n if i cent. It may be open to accusations of band-wagon-jumping from those who say that break-beats are everywhere, that everyone gets jungle\nre-mixes (even Terry Woganl), that these remixes even sell air-freshen ers and deodorants, and\nso on. However, this album is very much of its\ntime, as well as being innovative, hauntingly m ov ing, and a genuine classic.\nMy album of the year, and it's only May! (9)\n\n"

It is a place of\nardent worship. Visible from\nalmost anywhere, the people in\nthe streets below this Citadel\ntalk mainly of the battles that\nare fought each week inside the\ngates, where only a few\nprivileged may watch. St. James'\nPark, Newcastle, home of the\nteam that came second in the\nPremiership, has more parallels\nwith the Parthenon than you\nmay think.\nIn other cities, particularly\nManchester, football has become a tradeable commodity - the\nactivities on the pitch with Messrs\nGiggs, Cantona et al are only one\npart of the entity that is\nManchester United pic. The day\ncannot be far when their financial 1\nperformance inspires Nick\nLeeson's, as much as their sporting\nperformance inspired George Best's. Their continued success is not, a; everyone seems to think, a measure of their philosophy of\ninvesting in young local talent.\n^ anything, Alex Ferguson is quicker on\nthe the draw with the company credit\ncard than..Kevin Keegan and, as witnessed\nby his goading of the Leeds players\nfollowing their match with United, a cunning manipulator. Moreover in the\nNorth West, City and United vy e for\nattention, with City winning on credibility\nbecause of their association with Oasis.\nManchester is home of The soap and The\nfailed Olympic bid. Manchester also has its\nmusic, which in the last fifteen years has\nprovided acts like The Smiths, Take That\nand of course, Oasis. In Newcastle there is,\na beer and quite literally, only ONE Newcastle United.\nThe difference between the two clubs\nis also matter of philosophy. In Newcastle,\nSir John Hall has been successful because\nhe realised that football is not a sport,\nbut a religion. People conduct their\nlives in the shadow of St. James'\nPark. It is the cause of debate and worship\nhere. It's a life source, part of the substance\nthat flows through every Geordie. Little\nelse matters. Economic fortunes are tied to\nthe Club's success - the bars of the Bigg\nMarket were conspicuously empty on he\nnight of the famous 4-3 defeat at Anfield\nearlier this year. Debate and argument the\nfollowing day brought the City alive again.\nA quarter of a million philospher s sought\nout a priori reasons for that defeat, and\nthen applied the fundamentals of\nempiricism in a vain attempt to reason the\nfuture. Alex Ferguson plays to realise a profit margin. His North Eastern nemesis\napparently lays bare his soul every Saturday\nto fight for a way of life which he believes\nin passionately. Kevin Keegan is both hero\nand anti-hero. A maverick tempted off the\ngolf course by John Hall, he may not be the\nmost experienced person to manage a Premiership Club but experience\ndoesn't matter in religion. Jesus was\na carpenter, and Kevin Keegan's legendary status made him the\nideal person to guide this club.\nOne of the few players whose\nexistence in the physical world is\ndisproportion al to the effect they\nhave in it. He is metaphysical. Like\nGeorge Best he has successfully\ntranscended our world to become\nnot a person, but a symbol in our\nminds, of success, waste, sheer talent and\nhope. His physical embodiment is necessary\nonly to communicate with his players and\nthe media; otherwise he may as well exist as\na disembodied being in a spatial and\ntemporal existence beyond our conventional\ndimensions. We are in no position to argue\nwith such a man. We cannot see what he\nsees. We cannot reason as he does. He\nknows more than us mortals can\ncomprehend. We wailed when he sold\nAndrew Cole. We gnashed our\nteeth when \u00a38 million left the\ncoffers for Faustino Asprilla.\nAnd we will toy with failure if\nwe even attempt to comprehend\nwhy he played the entirety ol\nthis season without a de ten ce. Keegan is committed to his\nattacking game. The game, which has\nbeen a joy to watch; that has made\nthe Premiership the most exciting\ndivision in Europe; that will surely\nmake the conventional but insipid\n| 'long ball' and 'pass, move and\ndefend' ideas think again. Flair\nand passion have been evident,\nespecially in away games, where\nme sensed the zeal of pros let y zing missionaries. Despite the failure of\nthe team to win anything, his\nphilosophy has surely won? Newcastle's physical loss was immediately apparent. A tragedy that was surely portentous in this\nCity given its Greek parallels? But such\nthings matter less here than in the\nboardrooms of Anfield and Old Trafford.\nGeordies know, as their Hellenic, equally\nhedonistic and opulent, but slightly more\neffete ancestors did, that physical victory is\ntransient and irrelevant. Real victory comes\nin the immortal is ation of ideas and thoughts\nthat affect generations beyond our own.\nOver time the influence of thoughts are\nmultiplied until embodied in\nsubsequent actions. History tells us\nthat the metaphysical score line was\n' Greeks 2 Romans 0. Time will tell if\ntheir North Eastern descendants are\nqu ally persuasive with their\nphilosophy. Either way, the fate of this\nclub is written:\n\"Whatever may happen to you was\nprepared for you from all eternity\" - Marcus\nAurelius.\n\n"

Is there a communication breakdown, or\nour opinion simply breached? It\nis, after all, a university where\nstudents are a big part of the\ncommunity and should never be\npushed around like some second-class citizens. I believe it is up to\nus to fight for what is good for us\nand not just sit still and accept\nmercy from others. It is our job\nto make our voices heard, and\nhopefully listened to, by the\nthose up in the tower called\nSherfield.\nEric Chan\nChemical Engineering\nI could not agree with you more\nwhen you say that 'it is up to us\nto fight for what is good for us\nand not just sit still and accept\nmercy from other'. The problem\nthough is that you are not given\nall the information with which\nto fight. For instance, I suspect\nthat there was student involvement in taking decisions over\ncalculators, but who knows -maybe somebody might like to\ninform us. Similarly allegations\nhave been made about the May\ngraduation ceremony, but since\nthere has been no resp once from\nCollege - are they true?

She had spent six or so\nyears sporadically doing things\ncalled TMA's for the Open uni-vers it y. Her graduation ceremony\nwas in Belfast's Queens'\nUniversity Whitla Hall - a nice\nenough building in itself, but the\nsense of ceremony was somewhat marred when the various\ndign a tries and fellows walked in\nto the processional theme tune\nfrom Star Wars. Things had qui-e ten ed down a bit in time for the\nguest speaker (Cedric Thornberry, fresh from mediation s in\nSarajevo]. But by the time the\nVice-Chancellor had come to\nspeak, the Lord Mayor's Show\nhad begun to parade outside, so\nhis discourse was drowned out\nby Orangemen with bagpipes.\nAfterwards, we went across\nthe road in the drizzle for cups of\ntea in the QU B Students' Union,\nbut when the guest of honour,\nthe Vice Chancellor and their\nwives got stuck in the lift, it\nrather put a damper on things.\nThe first graduation ceremony I went to was my brother's, in\nOxford. There was certainly no\nlack of pomp and tradition. But\nlengthy doses of Latin chanting,\nand presentations that were\ndecide ly reminiscent of Masonic\nritual, aren't everyone's idea of\nthe way to celebrate one'se duca tion. I did the crossword.\nSo, on reflection, I reckon I had the best deal. But I was still\nfairly jealous of my mother\nbecause she was so happy and so\nproud.

I would like to apologise to the\nfinance office: I assumed that\nstudent grants came under their\njurisdiction, but apparently the\nare actually administered by the\nRegistry division.

Ben Wilkins talks to one of Brtains real ghostbusters\nWhen Andrew Green arrived at The Royal\nAlbert Hall early one evening, he brought\nhis tape recorder with him. His task was,\nto say the least, unusual. If your building is infested\nwith rats you call the exterminator; if your pipes are\nleal d ng, you call the plumber. But if your staff are\nbeing seriously spooked by ghostly apparitions, you\ncall Andrew Green - Britains top psychic invest iga tor. Six weeks ago the management asked Green if\nhe would come to The Royal Albert Hall and investigate some haunting problems they have been ha v ing. I arranged to meet him there last week to find\nout what he had discovered.\nWhen I got to the Royal Albert Hall I was\ntaken up to the Royal box and told to wait. From the\nbest seats in the house, I scanned the Hall's cavernous interior hoping to see a paranormal\npatron. There were none. Then two film\ncrews from CNN and CBS arrived along\nwith some other reporters and photographers. At this point I began to have my\ndoubts about being there. I wondered if this fl ff l whole thing was just a bizzar e invention by\nthe press office to give The Royal Albert\nHall some extra media attention.\nBut Green sounded genuine enough.\nHe is a member of is a member of The\nSociety for Psychical Research (SPR) and\nsince 1944 he has been investigating paranormal phenomena at a scientific level. He\nwas once a scientist but has had a varied car-re er, from lecturer to life gaur d. At 68, he\nnow spends his time lecturing on psychic\nphenomena and solving other people's paranormal problems. Green has been ghost-busting all over the country and has written\nseveral books on the subject. Some of the\nmore famous sites he has visited include The Old\nBailey, and Hampton Court Palace.\nWhile I was waiting for Green I got talking to\nIan Blackburn, the Building director.\n\"There have been ghost stories for as long as the\nHall has been here, but there is always a flurry of\nactivity whenever there is building work going on. I first became aware of it when contractors started\nrefusing to work in the basement late at night, complaining they had 'seen things'.\" Mr Blackburn did-n't seem too taken in by this spooky activity but he\ndid seem to know all the ghost stories.\nHe told me about Father Willis who constructed the original grand organ .in the n in teen th century. The organ was revoked in the 1920s but\nin the course ofthe alterations workman ran screaming from the Hall, frightened away by Willis, a stooped figure in a black skull cap. Then there are\nthe two giggling Victorian girls, often seen skipping\nthrough corridors late at night. The area they appear\nin is thought to be the f fomer site of Gore House ,\nwhere Count D 'Orsay lived with his mistress Lady\nBlessington. One theory is that the two girls are her\nnieces - who had a reputation for cavorting in the\nbasement. And during one of Jasper Carrot's performances the stage manager noticed a figure drift\nacross the stage. The incident was logged in the duty\nmanager's report but the identity of the mystery\nperson was never established.\nBack in the Royal box, Green had arrived, out\nof breath from climbing the stairs, with his wife\nAlan Green believes the Royal Albert Hall is Haunted\nNora - they are Britain's real life equivalent to\nMulder and Scully. Green was certainly was not the\ncrackpot I had half expected. Something about him\nsuggests he is very quick witted. He has an enthusiastic personality and he obviously enjoys talking\nabout his work. I asked him if it is possible to detect\nand record a ghost.\n\"With a bit of difficulty\" he says, \"The all edged phenomena are usually visual. But it's impossible to\nproduce a camera that will take a photograph of\nvisual apparitions at the drop of a hat. Therefore one\nhas to rely on electronic response units to detect\nother forms of paran on rial it y. In other words, drops\nin temperature, concentration of electronic disp are ment s, that sort of phenomena.\"\nOne of his most important instruments is a magnetic tape recorder. Green was involved in\ndeveloped a magnetic tape system when he was\nworking as a chemist and this is when he realized the\npotential for these materials to pick up static. He\nalso uses a sensitive digital thermometer, and an\nultra high frequency sound detector. Armed with\nhis equipment and a keen eye for the eerie, our\nghost busting hero patrols haunted sites around\nBritain. Most of the cases he investigates are\naccountable but he says in about 25 per cent of cases\nthings just don't add up.\n\"If one builds up a picture of the general concentration of malfunctions one can say well, OK,\nthere is something possibly happening.\"\nAndrew Green spent the night of 30th May\npatrolling The Royal Albert Hall, recording a mn ning commentary as he went\nalong. But when he played the tape back\n. he realized that in the area below door six\nhere the two girls were seen) the static electricity was so intense that it had\ncompletely obliterated the sound record-ing. \"A concentration of electricity for no\napparent reason\" was how he put it - and\nI think that was the closest he was going\nto get to saying 'ghost'.\nOn the same night, Green also recorded\na remarkable change in temperature.\nAccording to his thermometer, it suddenly rose by 8 degrees Celsius in 10 sec-on ds. This was in a small area on the\nfourth floor of the building. Right above\nthe grand organ.\nGreen seems fairly convinced that there\nare some unexplained phenomena occur-ing at the Royal Albert Hall. In his report\nto the Cheif Executive he will l be saying as much.\nWhat they do about it is up to them, he says.\nGreen's investigations will not con v in ve everybody of the existance of paranormal activity. True,\nhis objectivity may be slightly deficient and his\nresults have never been formally checked out, but at\nleast he is making a competent attempt to measure\npsychic phenomena. His approach is rational and he\noften discusses his results with other scientific colleagues - many of them University Professors who\nattend SPR meetings in their spare time.\nDid he convince me? Well he did invite me to\ngo and visit him in Sussex. He said he wanted to\nshow me all the haunted sites in his village. Perhaps\nI will go. Just out of curious it y. "

The views from our\nhostel, the old lifeboat station,\nwere pretty spectacular, and the\nnearest beach was less than a stone's throw away. Anyway, on\nwent the walking boots and we\nset out to discover a bit more of\nthe coastline.

Those of us who had\nhoped to appear on TV in a999 emergency were sadly disappointed when Dave emerged\nbefore his massive hole caved in.\nThe hole was then used to good\neffect, housing Paul and Tim,\nwhose heads we were good\nenough to leave unburied.\nFollowing a long afternoon\nof stile crossing, all we were fit\nfor in the evening was to collapse\nin the lounge and 'play' Trivial\npursuit with no board, no counters and no dice.\nLeft: Youth Hostelling Association: sea, sand and sandcastles.\nsunday\n19\nmay\nGliding Club\nGliding at Lasham Airfield.

From the\nRight, it has been argued that\nthe only viable rights are those\nsecured by consumers in the\nmarketplace - a perspective\nwhich conveniently ignores the\nfact that poverty excludes millions of people from exercising\n'market choices'. And from the\nLeft and Right alike it has been\nargued that since limited\nresources make social and economic rights unattainable, they\ncannot be seen as rights at all.\nThis is at once sell-evidently\ntrue and irrelevant since the only\nexisting obligation on governments is to secure that progressive attainment of social and\neconomic rights 'to the\" maximum resources available'.\nIf you are interested in getting involved or simply airing\nyour views at this event please\ncontact Jon (x5976,j. parkin-son@ic.ac.uk).\nmonday\n20\nmay\nStudent Industrial Society\n12 - 2pm.

    "content": "FELIX The student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nIssue 1057\nMay 17th1996 IC still ranks 3rd in Times league\nBY ANDREW SMITH\nThis morning's Times newspaper\nshows Imperial College retaining\nits historical third place in their\nannual league table of Britain's higher level institutions. With\nthe Times using a number of\ndifferent criteria in this year's scoring, Imperial has dropped\nfurther behind Cambridge and\nOxford, now standing over 120\npoints adrift of the top two.\nOnce again both library\nspending and accommodation are\nthe areas where Imperial suffers\nin comparison to Oxbridge. IC\nscores just 44 out of 100 in the\nlibrary category, while one of its\nmain rivals received maximum\npoints. The accommodation\nranking drags Imperial down\neven further, with a score of 34\nbeing well behind those of both\nOxford and Cambridge.\nCommenting on the results\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of\nImperial College, refused to\ndraw comfort Irom Imperial's consistent third placing. T want\nus to be first' he said. But he\nemphasised the arbitrary nature\nof the Times selection of criteria,\nsaying that \"we don't actually\nthink that tables like these are\nvery meaningful.\"\nJustifying Imperial's poor\nshowing when library funding\nlevels are compared, the Rector\nsuggested that IC's mix of\nsubjects might be influencing the\nscore. He insisted that College's library facilities are 'excellent',\nand suggested that the large\nnumber of scientific journals on\nthe Internet might lessen spending requirements in comparison\nwith those of universities specialising in the humanities.\nSir Ronald did not see any\nimmediate prospect of improving\nIC's comparatively unfavourable\nrecord on the provision of\naccommodation for students. He\nacknowledged that 'the rents are\nhigh', despite the fact that\ncollege sub sid is es them, and that\nit is \"hard to see any central\nLondon college being able to\nmatch Oxford or Cambridge.\"\nThis year's tables include\nofficial information from the\nContinued on page three\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nIC's contractors Sclial International are set to begin sheet piling\nnext week around the perimeter of the new Biomedical Sciences\nbuilding.

The\ndynamically loving but platonic relationship is\nportrayed through role-reversals and role-switch-ing particularly during the second act, when\nBarber is on his death-bed and is haunted by his\nvisually real conscience. This is contrasted with\nthe first half which chronicles a feverish Johnson\nstumbling and mumbling in his hours of darkness\nand this is juxtaposed with thematically linked\nflashbacks. The coherence of the recurring\nthemes create a compelling dramatic focus.\nMalcolm Rennie is\nsuperb as the haughty\nand humanitarian\nJohnson, and amazingly\ndeft as various characters emanating from\nBarber's conscience.\nAlmost as good is\nTyrone Huggins as the\nservant who tolerates\nthe impetuous childlike whims of Johnson\nwith compassion and\nwithout complaint, while also emotes volumes\nof suffering as the tortured soul at the end.\nWriter Maureen Lawrence has borrowed\nher dramatic tools from Dickens' 'A Christmas\nCarol' and Bernard Shaw's 'St Joan', but this\nisn't overt plagiarism. 'Resurrection' is an innovative exploration touching on oft-used but interesting themes that makes thoroughly good the-at re. play: blue remembered\nhills - dermis potter^j as s sek In light of the somewhat mixed reception of\n\"Karaoke\", it's timely that the National should\nrevive one of Dennis Potter's best-loved pieces\nthe 1979 \"Blue Remembered Hills\". Potter had\ndeveloped a reputation for what could be\ntermed uncompromising drama, mostly for tele vision - \"Brimstone and Treacle\", \"Pennies From\nHeaven\", \"The Singing Detective\" - famous for\nexplicit sex scenes, and a tendency for having his\ncharacters burst into song, seemingly at random.\nNeither feature here. Instead, we are returned to\nconsider a recurring Potter theme - that of his\nown childhood in the south-west of England,\nsometime during the last war - and the discovery that the world is indeed a dark and sinister\nplace.\nWe are in the company of seven seven-year\nolds in a fickle, fidgeting world of false bravado,\nBest Friends and that curiously twisted childhood reasoning. Are children in some way crueller than the adults they become? \"It is not the\nadult world writ small, childhood is the adult\nworld writ large\" explains Potter, and so the twist\nhere is that the characters of the children are\nplayed by adults - a device which is at first purely comic, but becomes increasingly unsettling.\nThere's the bully, Peter, and his friend and sometime victim, Willie (played by Steve\nCoogan, aka Alan Partridge), thoughtful John\nand stuttering cowboy Raymond, galloping\nbehind but never quite keeping up. The girls are\nless subtly drawn - Angela, the pretty one\n(already using this to her advantage), and\nAudrey, the plain one (seeing how this works\nagainst her). That just leaves tragic Donald, the\noutsider, playing with his matches...\nThe transformation of the stage into rolling\nhills and endless blue sky is itself childlike in exe-cut ion, and provides humorous touches. The\ncast handle difficult roles generally well, and\nthere are some genuinely hilarious moments.\nBut you just know Something Bad is going\nto happen.\nplay: dangerous play -andrew loudon dr ian tt mrs ton gordon\nThis is probably the closest most of us will get to\nhear a sensible discussion on the meaning of life\nas we know it. Man A( Nigel Langstone) and\nMan B( Ben Lemel) are well cast, and Andrew\nLoudon's carefully planned and thoughtful script\nmake the play seem more improvised than it\nactually is.\nThe actors start out discussing topics such as\natheism, political correctness, heaven and hell,\nproof of God and a variety of mind-stretching\ntopics of conversation, gradually highlighting the\ndifferences between their two approaches to life.\nMusic and song lighten the plights of the angelic\nMan A and the satanic Man B to such an extent\nthat they begin to really talk to each other in a meaningful way, out of mutual respect for their\nrespective ad verso rial roles.\nThe beautifully lit and simple design (Tim\nClark) sets the play in an indefinable living room.\nIt could even be a pub l Director Lucille O 'Llanagan is usually more\nat home directing larger-than-life characters in a spectacular fashion, but this excursion into the\nseedier side of acting is dealt with highly creatively with her supremely deadly technique, the\nshock factor! You really find it quite hard to tell\nwhere the play starts and where it finishes\nbecause, like life, this play is full of surprises,\nsome pleasant and some not!\n\n"

Secondly, Finance Staff are\nencouraged to treat students\nsympathetically. In most of the\ncontacts that .students have with\nus, we are in the unfortunate\nposition of having to extract\nmoney from them and only occasionally do we have to hand\nmoney out to them. We all\nrealise that students are not generally well-off and do not have a lot of cash to throw around, but\nin life one does have to pay one's debts and students are no exception to this rule. We try to ease\nthe pain of it as much as we can.\nPoliteness and helpfulness cost\nnothing except a little time, and\nwhile I have to admit that time is\nat a premium, I would be very\nupset if I heard any of my colleagues acting in the way\ndescribed in your editorial.\n\u2022 I hope that you will find the\nspace in your next editorial to\nacknowledge that you managed\nto mistake Finance Division for\nanother one.\nYours sincerely,\nBrian Devlin\nCredit Controller\nFinance Department\nYou are just too diplomatic by\nhalf, Brian. With regard to the\nissue of grant cheques - Rachel\ndid mistake Finance for 'else-where in administration', as you\nso delicately put it, that elsewhere being Registry.\nI'm glad to see, though that\nyou basically agree with her that\nthe attitude that staff take when\ndealing with students is imp or tant. As you say 'Politeness and\nhelpfulness cost nothing except\na little time'. Now if only everybody in College acted on that!\nstudent sacrifice\nDear Felix,\nI read with great interest\nyour editorial on Felix 1056\n'Unhappy People'. Many recent\nissues lead me to think that students welfare has been sacr f iced in the hands of college administration. It seems a common concept in Sherfield that decisions\nare made based on their objective/ convenience/benefit; consideration for students are way\ndown on their priority.\nCite the new May graduation\nas an example: it is indeed a good\narrangement to reduce the length\nof the ceremony, but the invitation and announcement is quite\npoorly handled. Many invitations\nwere allegedly sent out late, some\ngraduates received the announcement only by the middle of\nMarch. This is rather short notice\nfor an event taking place on 1\nMay, and especially difficult for\noverseas students who make up a fair number of the postgraduate\npopulation. And, in view of these\ndifficulties, there is no offer to\nthe absentee to attend the\nOctober ceremony. (This should\nreally be an exception rather than\na rule. But considering effect of\nthe late invitation (see Felix 1055\n'New degree ceremony 'low\nkey'), perhaps the College should\nconsider a more flexible approach\nas a gesture of good will?)\nAnother example literally\ndaunts on me when I walk pass\nthe central library every morning:\nHow can it be justified that construction work on the library\nextension has to start in May,\nwhen most of the students are\nusing the library to prepare for\ntheir final exams? Is it not apparent that the noise level is a big\nnuisance to say the least?\nOther examples include:\n\u2022 The proposal of replacing the\nUnion bookstore with one run by\nan outside business, thus replacing a Union service that has\n/ cu IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nFIND THE\nANSWERS ICU AGM FRI 17TH MAY\n12.15 ENTS LOUNGE\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY MAY 1 7TH1996. THREE\nmourn Vic Turner\nSecurity\nVic Turner, the well known and\nmuch respected Imperial College\nSecurity Supervisor, died suddenly in the early hours of\nTuesday 14th May. It has been\nconfirmed that he died of a heart\nattack despite the best attempts\nof his Colleagues, Cathy and Terry, and an ambulance crew to\nrevive him.\nStarting work on Monday evening, he took his scheduled\nbreak in the early hours of\nTuesday morning, going upstairs\nfrom his post in the Sherfield\nBuilding to the Senior Common Room. He was discovered when one of his colleagues later went\nto inform him that they were\nstarting their rounds.\nVie had worked in College\nfor fifteen years, and was much appreciated through his contact\nwith staff and students. He started work as a Security\nOfficer stationed in the Physics\nDepartment, later being transferred to Beit Quad where he\nworked for over two years.\nVic then moved to the\nSherfield Building, after being\npromoted to Assistant Deputy\nSupervisor, where he was to\nwork for the next ten years. In\nMay 1992 he was again\npromoted, this time to Shift\nSupervisor, under the new shift\nsystem that was then being\nimplemented.\nOriginally trained as a butcher, serving an apprenticeship in Spitalfields Market, Vic\nran his own shop before coming\nto Imperial College. His interests\noutside work centred on his\nfamily, to whom he was devoted,\nand his keen in passion for\ngardening.\nThe tragedy is compounded\nby the fact that both his children\nwork at Imperial: his daughter\nMickie works in the Finance\nDepartment as Business\nAccounts Supervisor, and his son\nJason works in the Postal Section\nof the Security Department.\nJason is due to be married in just\nover two weeks time.\nVic's death came as a terrible\nshock to his friends and\ncolleagues as he was only fifty\nsix, and had always been\nextremely fit and active. His loss\nto both the Security Department\nand his friends throughout the\nCollege is keenly felt, known as\nhe was for his forthright expression of views and his down to\nearth nature.\nHe is survived by his wife\nPam, son and daughter. A book\nof condolences is available for\nsigning at the security desk in\nSherfield. His funeral is expected\nto take place early next week.\nContinued from page one\ngovernment inspectorate\ncharged with assessing the quality of teaching in Britain's universities. Course completion\nrates are not included this time,\nbut the number of international\nstudents does constitute one of\nthe nine criteria.\nImperial scored a maximum\n100 in the ranking of staff-student ratios, with other high\nscores being achieved in categories measuring employment,\nresearch, and the number of first\nclass degrees handed out. These\nfigures pushed Imperial well\nahead of their nearest challengers with LSE and UCL over\nfifty points behind.\nJohn O 'Leary, the\nEducation Editor of The Times,\nsuggested that this year's figures\nare not exactly comparable to\nlast year's, due to the slight\nchange in scoring criteria. He\nfurther went on to say that\nImperial College might hope to\nnarrow the gap next year when\nthe results of this year's research\nassessment exercise are fully\nincorporated.\nImperial College of Science,\nTechnology and Medicine\nHumanities Programme\nOpen Day\nWednesday, 22 May 1996\n12.00-14.00\nRooms 313A and 313B, Mechanical Engineering Building\nAn opportunity to talk to the Humanities and\nLanguages Teachers a Pout the options available to\nyou next year.

Call me an old cynic, but it strikes me that\nher biggest crime was documenting what she did\nand doing it blatantly. It is widely acknowledged\nthat Labour ran a campaign to 'build the Tories\nout of London' during the sixties, situating high\nrise, low quality housing to dilute the\nConservative vote. The only difference, save for\nthe much greater scale and subsequent social cat-a strophe, was that they never wrote down their\nactions. Porter's actions, if proved in the appeal,\nwere undoubtedly wrong, but to suggest that\nthis is the greatest mis demean our in Local\nGovernment his to iy is plainly ridiculous. I see\nthat one of last week's lottery winners, Karl\nCompton, with \u00a311 million in the bank, is looking for Miss Right. Shirley, he lives in Blackpool...\nLast week's editorial on the state of IC's staff was both interesting and brave (God help\nyou if you ever lose your swipe card, Rachel!)\nand links nicely with something that I have been\nmeaning to say for a few weeks. Although the\nstaff in Chemistry are genuinely a very cheerful\nand helpful bunch, despite some of the really\ndod gy undergraduates clogging up the place,\nthere are some who are very rude and insolent.\nSome of the security staff (mainly those in the\nlibrary) are very jovial, but others make you wonder if those grey uniforms are really faded black\n1942 Stormtrooper outfits from the V&A col-lect ion. One explanation for the apparent misery of\nthe staff which can be immediately discounted is\nloneliness, at least in Sherfield. A week or so ago,\ntwelve people were spotted in the Admissions\nRegistry, a room the size of Wembley arena. Bad\nenough, you think, but when you see what they\nare actually doing, you lose all sympathy for the\nCollege in its treatment by the Government. A good number of Imperial students stay on to do\npostgraduate studies, for which one obviously\nhas to fill in an application form. Naturally, we fill\nin a different form from outsiders, since they\nneed to give more information. You might think\nit silly to have to write your A Level grades on an\ninternal application, and madness to name the\ninstitute where you expected to study. Au con-tr aire, my friends, for if you want to do a PhD or\nMSc at Imperial, you will\nbe asked ex acd y that.\nThe temptation to write\nParticle Physics with\nCrochet-ing at the\nBarnsley Institute of\nAdvanced Needlework\nwas nearly impossible to\nresist.\nHaving filled in this form,\nI received a letter from Registry a week later asking for references, which I don't need, and ten\ndays from submission, this piece of paper had\nfailed to make the short journey across the lawn\nto Chemistry. This unnecessary paper shifting,\ntelling people who do not need to know information they already have, is a scandalous waste\nof time and money and symptomatic of the\nsheer pointlessness of huge swathes of Sherfield.\nI look forward to hearing the views of Registrar\nNigel Wheatley on how he justifies the unnecessary use of College resources which merely\nserves to clog up a busy system. There are multinationals with smaller head offices than\nSherfield and I dare say they run things better. If\nit were to be built now on the same scale, it\nwould be so far down the government priority\nlist that it would be competing with the plan to\nestablish a Ministry of Silly Walks.\nAs most of you will now realise, the gates\nnear Biochemistry are now locked at 1 l pm. The\nreason for this, we are told, is security, and I for\none remember the huge gangs of armed raiders\nwho have nightly terror is ed the campus since the\n1850s up until this new measure. Correct me if\nI am wrong, but most of the break-ins at\nImperial have been in places where the closure\nof these gates would have not made a blind bit of\ndifference, such as the enormous spate of computer thefts from the Huxley building. The\nmajor consequence of this action has been to\nforce people who leave Southside wishing to get\nto Gloucester Road to trek along Prince Consort\nRoad. If you must lock them, why not do it at\nmidnight when most people will have left\nCollege, or soon you will end up with students\nimpaled on the railings as they make a bid for\nfreedom. And while I'm on the subject of these\ngates, I must take this opportunity to thank Ian\nCaldwell for the helpful signs now adorning said\nironwork which state 'This is a temporary gate.'\nYou have excelled yourself. This ranks as the\nmost pointless sign, and hence greatest waste of\nmoney, I have ever seen. When is the This is a temporary sign' sign going up?\nIt is a shame that this week's column has\nbeen so negative about IC, but it's nice to report\nthat one facet of the old girl consistently functions perfectly. I refer, of course, to Southside\nBar, home to the finest and broadest range of ales in Christendom (and if that doesn't get me a free\npint, nothing will). I have to report unacceptable\nbehaviour by one of the punters, who asked for\n'a pint of bitter'. Do you, when buying a car, ask\nfor 'a red one? You have sinned. May God have\nmercy on your wretched soul.\n\n"
