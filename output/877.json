At the IC Sports Centre\nevery Monday and Friday evenings\nbetween 6.30 and 9.00pm. What's the\noccasion? None really, it's just what we\nlike to do! And no, we're not\nexhibitionists, it's just that clothes make\nwhat we do harder! It makes what\nharder? Getting wet, dummy! Twice a week the IC Swimming and Water Polo\nclub get naked (well almost) for a total\nfitness workout. So, if you've got any\nflabby bits that could do with being toned\nup, tightened or just in need of a lift\n(ladies!), come on down.\nAt each training session, participants\nare put through a schedule aimed at\ncontinuously improving their\nperformance. The atmosphere isn't serious\u2014rather more relaxed and\nconvivial, since it's only for fun. There's no pressure\u2014we just encourage you to\ntry and do a bit better every time you\ncome along. So why not give it a try?\nRemember that swimming is the only\ntrue means of achieving a total body\nworkout (aerobics sucks!). So come for a swim once or twice a week between 6.30\nand 7.30pm. ICYHA\nThree weeks of uncharacteristically\nsettled Highland weather contributed to a successful Scottish summer\ncamping/walking tour, which took in\nareas of scenic grandeur such as Glencoe,\nLoch Torridon, Sutherland and Cape\nWrath. For those with the will and the\nlegs to match, staggering up the nearest\nmountain was one means of escape from\nthe forced attentions of the local midge\nThen if you've got any energy left, stick\naround and join in our 'Balls and\nRubbers' session. Kinky? Not at all\u2014it's just Water Polo, and it's not for the faint\nhearted! Both men and women are\nencouraged to join in and give this most\nstrenuous sport of all a try. After\nswimming, between 7.30 and 9pm, Mondays and Fridays coaching takes\nplace for external (to College)\ncompetitions, after which most evenings\nare concluded by a quick friendly (sic)\ngame. So if you're good with balls\n(irrespective of which anatomical\nappendage you use), are confident in the\npool and feel like giving one of the most\nsocial clubs in College a crack, come\nalong and give 'the game' a go.\nFor those of you intent on joining for\nthe year, membership fees are currently\n\u00a36/annum for students, AIFS etc, and\n\u00a312/annum for staff/public etc. To join\neither come along to any regular club\nsession or for the next two weeks only,\ncome to the upper Southside Lounge on\nMondays between 12.30pm and 1.30pm. Remember to bring not only your\nsubscription fee, but also a passport-size\nphoto.\npopulation. However, the lure of the\ninviting secluded beach generally proved\ninexorable on occasions when the heat\nrendered both legs and will-power\ninoperative.\nDetails of this term's events can be had\nat our regular Thursday meetings\n(12.30pm in Southside Upper Lounge) to\nwhich all are welcome.\nWing\nChun\nCLUBS\nThe Wing Chun Boxing Academy again\nhad a very successful year in the 89/90\nseason. Excellent tuition was given\npersonally by Master Sofos throughout\nthe whole year and this was reflected in\nthe very high standards the students\nreached in just one year. The quality of\nthe equipment and apparatus used by the\nstudents was maintained, ensuring that\nthe Academy remained one of the best\nmartial arts clubs in Europe.\nThe Academy also had a very busy\nyear with a full diary of events including\nadvanced Kung Fu seminars and a winter\ncamp. The winter camp was a great day\nout for all with the outdoor training,\nbarbecue and the famous assault course!\nHowever, the highlight of the year was\nthe charity show, 'A Night of Magic\u2014The\nMaster'. This spectacular event was the\nfirst of its kind, a live martial arts show,\nand was created and directed single-handedly by Master Sofos. Many of the\nstudents took part in the show and they\nwill never forget the thrill of performing\ntheir Kung Fu in front of six hundred\npeople. The show was a complete success\nand in the end it helped to raise over\n\u00a32000 for charity.\nNow we look forward to a new season\nwhich promises to be just as active and\nenjoyable as the last. We are always\neager to help new students who are\nintrigued by the beautiful and highly\npractical art of Wing Chun Kung Fu, so if\nyou're interested in finding new meaning\nand strength in your life or just an\neffective form of self-defence, then come\nalong and see us at the Freshers' Fair,\nyou've got nothing to lose!\nFilmSoc\nNext Thursday's Filmsoc presentation is\nWhen Harry Met Sally.\nThe film charts the relationship\nbetween Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and\nSally Arbright (Meg Ryan). They first\nmeet in their college days when they find\nthey each have differing views on life,\nsex, the universe and everything.\nThey part as enemies but find that as\nthe years pass they slowly become more\ntoller ant of each other and eventually\nthey become the best of friends.\nThe film is best remembered for the\nclassic deli scene in which Sally convinces\nHarry that women are capable of faking\norgasms by doing just that while eating\nlunch.\nThe film is the first in the Filmsoc\nseason which will be shown in Mech Eng\n220 at 7.30pm every Thursday. Admission\nis free for new members of ICU Filmsoc\nand \u00a31.50 for non-members.\n11\n\n"

The college needed a waiver from the secretary of state before\n\u2022the land could be used for student\nresidences. This has been granted and a deed of confirmation is expected soon.\nOther delays came from changes in the\nAn experiment designed by Imperial\nCollege's Space physics department will\nprobably go up on the space shuttle\n'Discovery' this weekend. The experiment\nis part of the 'Ulysses' mission. The space\nprobe will be sent on a trajectory which\nwill sling it around Jupiter and then onto\na polar orbit of the Sun.\nThis will be the first time that a space\nprobe has attained a course that was not\nwithin the plane of the planets. Professor\nStan Cowley, head of the Space and\nAtmospheric Physics group at I.C., said\nthat this had not been attempted before\nbecause the trajectory was very energy\nexpensive. He said that the probe\n'Ulysses' would be launched from the\npayload of 'Discovery' with solid fuel\nboosters attached. Once these fired,\n'Ulysses' would become the fastest manmade object ever.\nProfessor Cowley said that the mission's main aim was the study of the solar wind\nand the accompanying solar magnetic\nfield. He added that the two instruments\nthat I.C. had produced were a magneto meter that could detect a magnetic field of one tenth nano Tesla the earth's magnetic field at South\nKensington is 50,000 nano Tesla and a detector of solar particles, which are\nmainly protons with energies of about\nl MeV. Institutions from all over the\nworld, but particularly the USA, will be\ncontributing their know-how towards the\ninstruments on board, all of which will be\nstudying factors related to the Sun's effects.\nThe magneto meter is a small box less\nthan a foot cubed and is attached to the\nend of a extendable boom to keep it\naway from the electrical interference of\nthe probe itself. It cost \u00a31/2 million to\nbuild and was funded by Science and\nEngineering Research Council (SERC). The\nwhole project will cost many hundreds of\nmillions of pounds and is the result of a collaboration between the European\n2\nspecification, including alterations to\ncomply with security arrangements. The\ncost of the estate is now S10.5M including\nfurnishing but excluding financing and\nprofessional fees.\nA few buildings have already been\nstarted, including a show home. Building\nwork continues and should be complete\nat the end of 1991. There are four phases\nto the building work and students will be\nable to move in as these are completed.\nThe venture was described by Angus\nFraser, Managing Director of Imperial\nCollage, as 'a great opportunity' for\nImperial.\nA hoaxer set of the fire alarm in Beit Hall\nduring the Fresher's carnival last Tuesday\nmorning. There was only one security\nguard present to deal with the situation.\nBen Turner, Union Deputy President\nstated that there should have been two\non duty all night.\nThe alarm, which started at 12.15am was found to have originated on the\nsecond floor of Beit New Hostel. On this\nfloor, however, the alarm bell failed to\nsound. A bell at the top of the West\nstaircase in the Union Building also failed.\nOwing to the loudness of the disco, few\npeople left the Union Building even\nthough the alarm was sounding. When\nthe music was turned off, however,\npeople started to move out. Ben Turner\nsaid that this was reasonable as it allowed\nstewards to get into position. The partygoers continued leave even when the\nalarm stopped.\nIC Spaced Out\nSpace Agency (ESA) and National\nAer.on au tics and Space Administration\n(NASA).\nProfessor Cowley said that the period in\nwhich the launch could take place started\nfrom October 5th and only continued\nuntil October 25th, with a2 hour period\neach day in which the shuttle can be\nlaunched. If this window is missed the\nprogramme will have to postponed for 13\nmonths until the Earth and Jupiter are\nonce more in the correct alignment. He\nsaid that the favourite launch date was\nthis Saturday. The probe 'Ulysses' should\nreach Jupiter by February 1992, and pass\nthe south pole of the Sun by summer\n1994. It should then continue around to\npass the north pole a year later. Professor\nCowley said that this marked the end of\nthe mission but the machines would still\nbe running and further measurements\ncould be taken.\nThe original idea for the mission had\nbeen put forward before 1977 and the\ninstruments were built, with the help of\nthe Jet Propulsion laboratories in the\nUSA, ready for launch in 1983. NASA got\ninto financial difficulties and the next date\nwas in 1986, to be taken up in the Space\nShuttle 'Challenger'. Professor Cowley\nsaid that the I.C. team, including himself,\nhad witnessed the Challenger disaster.\nSince then they had kept the equipment\nin good working order. He said 'the\nwhole effort has taken much longer than\nnormal' and added that it would be\nanother five years until the end of the\nmission and a further five years until all\nthe data is analysed.\nMr Andre Balogh, head of\nInstrumentation in the Space Physics at\nI.C. and principle investigator for the\nmagneto meter, is at Cape Canaveral at\nthe moment supervising the machine's last earthbound moments. Professor\nCowley, a co-investigator for the\ninstrument, said that the mission was of\n'no practical consequence - it is pure\nscience exploration at this stage.'\nStop Press.Stop Press.Stop Press.Stop\nA fire broke out in Weeks Hall at around\n1.30am this morning. The incident was\ncaused by a faulty heater turned on for\nonly a minute. Following a banging sound\nfrom the unit, the fire caught and soon\nfilled the room and corridor with smoke.\nThe flames were extinguished by two\nresidents. Despite the smoke no alarms\nwere triggered.\n\n"

Batman\nrestarted a trend in films based on comic\nstrips, continued this year with Dick\nTracy and Hardware. No expense was\nspared. The film featured three of\nHollywood's most popular stars (Michael\nKeaton, Kim Basinger and Jack\nNicholson), a soundtrack by Prince, and\nspectacular effects.\nThe film tells the story of a murder of\nBruce Wayne's parents and his transition\ninto 'Batman', crime fighter\nextra ordinaire. The Joker (Nicholson) was\nchosen to be Batman's( Keaton)\nadversary. The makers broke with\ntradition though by changing the car into\nan armadillo, and wiping the Boy Wonder\nout of the script entirely.\nNicholson's acting was disturbing as\nusual, and Keaton manages to convey\nboth the vulnerability of Bruce Wayne\nand the quiet efficiency of Batman with\nequal panache.\nBatman will be shown by ics f on\nTuesday 9th,7 pm in Mech Eng 220.\nULU Gay and Lesbian\nFor some lesbian and gay students new\nto London, the wide range of gay clubs,\npubs and discos in the capital can seem\nan exciting terrain waiting to be\nexplored. But for most gay people\nespecially those who have yet to come to\nterms with their sexuality, the prospect\ncan appear intimidating. The London\nUniversity Lesbian and Gay Society is run\nby, and for, students and we are always\nhappy to welcome new faces along to our\nweekly meetings. Sometimes we invite\nwell-known speakers to talk about issues\nof concern to the gay community; last\nyear we welcomed many such speakers,\nincluding Derek Jarman (film producer),\nMatthew Parris (the Tory ex-MP) and\nDavid Fernbach (Director of the Gay\nMen's Press). On other occasions we show\nvideos, or organise outings to restaurants\nand pubs. Most importantly, however, our\ngroup offers you somewhere you'll be\nable to meet and chat with other gay\nstudents from all over London.\nOn the schedule for this term is a speaker-meeting with Britain's only only\ngay MP, Chris Smith, and a discussion\nevening with Peter Tatchell, the\ncampaigner on AlDS-related issues. This\ncoming week we hope to be joined by\nMichael Cashman, the actor who played\nEastenders' gay character, Colin. This\nmeeting will also be open to non-gay\nstudents.\nWe meet each on Thursday evenings at\n7.30pm in Room 2D at the University of\nLondon Union, Malet Street, London\nWC1.

Similarly, if you say that you can\nread this morning's edition of The\nFinancial Times, The Investors Chronicle\nor Business magazine with something\napproaching a smooth comprehension\nthen you are in the minority again and\nI 've never met you. If, however, you\ncould sustain an intelligent and informed\nconversation on some aspect of finance,\nbusiness or investment then you are an\nendangered, if not extinct, species. Do\nyou strike yourself as the sort of person\nwho has demonstrated an interest in and\nknowledge of an area of employment that\nyou are quite possibly destined for? (If\nnot, prepare yourself for painful\ninterviews and tough competition for the\nbest career opportunities.)\nHence, the Finance, Business and\nHence, the Finance, Business and\nInvestment Society at Imperial College.\nOur most important aims include getting\npeople interested in, and absorbing the\nfacts, concepts and current issues in as\nstimulating a way as possible. The hope is\nthat by participating in the Society's activities you will begin to build a familiarity and understanding of the\nworld of finance, business and \u2022\ninvestment, that will serve you in many\nways in the future, even if you do not\nwork in these areas. You may discover\nan opportunity to develop your potential\nin ways that have not occurred to you\u2014a project with the management school, an\ninterview with the director of a company,\na summer placement at a business school,\nan article or survey in our magazine etc.\nIf you are one of those rare students\nwith an appreciation of these areas or just\nenthusiastic and willing to contribute then\nget in touch with us\u2014there's loads of\ninteresting stuff to do!\nThe first event will be on Tuesday 9\nOctober at 5.45pm in the Mathematics\nDepartment room 410. A company\ncalled 'Financial i' will be showing the\nfirst of three films in a series entitled 'UK\nequities', which assume no prior\nknowledge and are pitched at an\nelementary but progressive level. Topics\ncovered in the first part will include\n'What is a Share?', 'The Securities\nMarket', Mergers and Aquisitions' and\nmuch more. The following two films deal\nwith 'Brokers', 'Bulls and Bears', 'Unit\nTrusts and Investment Trusts', 'The FTSE\n100', 'The FT Actuaries', 'Gross Dividend\nYield', 'The 30 Share Index' among many\nother subjects. Companies and\nprofessionals using Financial i's training\nmaterial include Banks, Accountancies,\nSecurities Houses, Lawyers and Fund\nManagers in over 40 countries worldwide.\nThose interested in the vacant committee\nposts should attend the first event.\nOur second event, 'How to read the\nFinancial Pages' is presented by Terry\nByland, the Financial Times author of\n'Understanding Finance With the\nFinancial Times'. All attending will be\npresented with a copy of The Financial\nTimes to be used during the session.\nCome along on Wednesday 17 October,\nMaths Room 410 at 12.45pm.

Those not\nlegitimately within the Union building will\nbe ejected.\nSeveral thefts through the summer have\nhighlighted the need for tighter\nprocedures within the Union building.\nThere has been only one minor theft\nrecently. The reduction of thefts is largely\nthe result of greater alertness and\ncommonsense.\nAll users of rooms within the Union\nBuilding will be required to arrange for\nthat room to be securely locked after use,\nor face a ban from using Union facilities.\nA programme is underway to make\nrooms more secure, including changing\ndoors with glass to solid doors, adding\ndoor and window alarms and tightening\nup key access.\nEvacuation Procedures\nA procedure is being developed in\naccordance with new College instructions.\nAs Monday night's Carnival demonstrated,\nthe evacuation was effective, but\nimprovements are being made for\ntomorrow's Freshers' Ball.\nHouse\nThe Refectory Flat, a little known room\nin the depths of the Union Building, will\nbe refurbished.

More\nrecent work has shown a diversification\nof their style, including elements of dub\nand a generally more funky sound.\nStrange Things continues this but takes it\ntoo far, giving the album a much more\nmainstream dance feel; tracks such as\nWolf In Sheep's Clothing and See The\nFire Burning veer too much towards the\neasily accessible and become simply\nunmemorable. There is a general lack of\nthe strange things that the title promises;\nindeed, the title track is a particularly\nmundane soul ballad with none of the\ncreativity that previously made Tackhead\nso distinctive. Within this style, however,\nsome tracks are quite successful. For This\nI Sing is a particularly eloquent song on the quality of patriotism in time of war,\nan old theme done here in a fresh\nfashion. Whereas in previous Tackhead\nefforts there might be too much of an\nemphasis on including all samples\navailable on a particular subject into a themed song, here the balance between\ngroove and vocals is just right. Adrian\nSherwood, credited as 'sound designer'\nmanages to harness the raw Tackhead\nnoise so that it manages to harness the\nvocals effectively. Political songs were\nalways Tackhead's speciality: here, the\nlist of topics were always Tackhead's speciality: here, the list of topics covered\nranges from sex'n 'drugs through to big\nbusiness. Dangerous Sex makes the\nconnection between sex and money and this power in an realistic way. Change\nrecognises that revolution is NOT just\nabout to happen. As a whole, this record\nlacks excitement and originality, almost\nas if the group believes that by making\nduller tunes they can get more airplay.\nNot so. Only the last track, Positive\nSuggestion, has the creative freshness that\nis Tackhead's talent; this is what they\nshould be developing.\nSome Fresher in Beit Hall\nRide\nFall EP\nAfter the diss appointing frivolous\nblandness of the second EP, Play, Ride\nhave burst back to the fore to regain\ntheir proud status of the guitar hope for\nthe decade. The first track, Dreams Burn\nDown, is their masterpiece remembered\neven from their earliest gigs and now still\nmore magnificent with age. It glistens and\nspears with dreamy tears of sheer\npleasure. Within seconds, Taste bounces\nin with more hair and energy than ever,\nbut who are they trying to fool with\nthose false London accents? Over on side\n2 (or side 1 on the CD for all you rich\nkids out there), Nowhere features a chugging harmonica, which is obvious\nreally, since the song is about a train. No sign of the blues here though as Ride\nreach their peak of bliss with the softly\nscreaming Here And Now laced with\nfeedback and flange. It's wondrous.\nSJH\nAnthrax Persistance of Time LP\nThe music on this album is as mechanical\nas any pop song while stylistically having\nmoved towards heavy metal and away\nfrom their previous punk ish thrash style.\nIt's really repetitious and boring. What's more Anthrax's lyrics have lost their bite.\nThey don't seem to be trying to see what\nthe causes of social problems really are\n(eg racism) so much as complaining about\nthe symptoms. The band only concentrate\non the handing down of prejudice over\ngenerations without reference to how the\nmedia stoke it up in the interests of the\nrulers. They once campaigned for the\nidea of freedom for everyone but now\nthey seem to think we already have it.\nPerhaps they no longer live among\nordinary people and are getting their\nideas second-hand from the press.\nMusically and lyrically, this once-great\nthrash band have almost run out of ideas,\nbut not quite. One line in the chorus of\nH8RED stands out: 'Different but equal...'\nIt's a concept worth hanging on to.\nJason Pike.\nEat\nPsycho Couch 7\"\nEat are the sort of band that never quite\ngot going in the 80s but lingered on to\nattack th he90 s. In this context, their\nslightly dated sound actually appears\nrefreshingly novel. On Psycho Couch they\nplay a toughened bass, all the more\ndemanding for the d is chords, heightened\nby the j a un Ling rhythm and guitars all\ntamed by the voice of .The whole is a hauntingly stirring variation which has\nthe right to be blasted full power through\nocto phonic stereo for total appreciation.\nFor a similar effect, simply tape yourself\nto the underside of the corkscrew\nrollercoaster. The double-A( yet more\nindecision) is a more up-tempo rock of\nslides and screams and slow splendour,\ncontinuing where the last left off. This is\nnot stuff for the faint hearted. Eat\ndramatically show how to submit to\ntoday's dance rhythm trends and blight\nthem into space.\nSJH.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "Bad Influence I don't mind admitting that I fully\nexpected to loathe Bad Influence. Why?\nWell, firstly, it is apparently a buddy\nmovie, and secondly, it stars Rob Lowe,\nstar of such immortal classics as Oxford\nBlues and Class (in which his co-star had\nhis way with Jacqueline Bisset) and of\ncourse that other unofficial motel-room\nclassic in which Rob Lowe 'starred' with\nan underage girl.\nThis film starts in familiar buddy movie\nterritory\u2014successful yuppie Michael\n(James Spader) with the right job, the\nright fiancee, the right car, and the right\nfuture is saved by handsome loner Alex\n(Lowe) after a macho brawl in a seafront\nbar. Yes, that old scene again. The\ninevitable progression sees Alex\nintroducing Michael to his fab and groovy\nlifestyle\u2014weird Los Angeles nightclubs,\neven weirder women\u2014and to his\nphilosophy of life, which increasingly\nreveals itself to have a very dark,\ncunning evil streak.\nAt first, Michael is quite happy to go\nalong with Alex's schemes, since he\nmanages to score points off his rivals at\nwork and has a very good time with a lady who is definitely not his\nstraight laced WASP fiancee. Obviously\nRob Lowe has learnt the power of video\ncameras, since he takes footage of\nMichael in action and uses it to\ndevastating effect to terminate the\nengagement. Gradually, Michael realises\nthat this situation is becoming\ndangerous\u2014but by now it is too late: he\nhas joined in an armed robbery and a few other things beside. Here the film\nreally gets interesting because it departs\nfrom the normal well-worn path of the\nbuddy movie as Alex and Michael slug it\nout in crea s in ly deviously and gruesomely.\nThe film is genuinely exciting; you\nreally don't know how it is going to\nfinish, as Michael's latent cunning is\ntested to its limit by Alex's cruel\nstrategies. David Koepp's strong, albeit\nThe Guardian\nHave you ever been looked after by a babysitter? Did he or she steal you away\nto be sacrificed to an evil tree only to be\nsnatched back just in time by y cur parents? No, I thought not. Whilst most\nhorror movies stretch your credulity, this\nflick takes it to the limit.\nThe adverts speak of druids and fights\nbetween good and bad but this has\nnothing to do with the film, being more\ninvolved with a woman who is the\nmaterial extension of the evil tree's spirit\n(a dryad). No druids and no spectacular\nfights between trees.\nAfter a sacrificed baby, the film starts\nslowly with the selection of the\nbabysitter. Since the baby must reach a certain age before it can be sacrificed, the\nfilm concentrates on how nice the parents\nare. Only in the second half of the film is\nthere any action, mostly concerning\nflying leaves.\nA scene involving potential muggers\ngives the tree a chance to kill a few\npeople with maximum on-screen violence.\nThis paves the way for the sacrifice and\nthe defeat of the evil tree. This is handled\nwell, with the best effects of the film.\nIt is a pity that these effects did not\npenetrate further into the film since the\nsuspense is adequate but could have been\nimproved with more FX. Overall a second\nrate thriller/horror movie but good for\nmild entertainment.\nToby Jones\n\u00bb\u2022 ted\n9\nREVIEWS\nsomewhat far-fetched story, is helped by\nCurtis Hanson's sharp direction in a moodily lit night-time Los Angeles, but of\ncourse all this would be as nothing if the\nperformances were not up to scratch.\nJames Spader showed in Sex, Lies and\nVideotape that he can act and this is\nanother strong, thoughtful performance\nwhich will certainly do his career no\nharm. However, the real surprise is Rob\nLowe, who in previous films has\ndemonstrated all the charisma of a brown\npaper bag. His performance here is\nmature and assured, playing the difficult\ncharacter of Alex with smooth charm that\nbarely conceals the menace lurking below\nthe surface. In fact the whole film,\nexcepting the s lowish start, almost\ncrackles with tension, although there are\na few laughs on offer to season the\nrecipe. If you are planning to go to the\nflicks soon you would be well advised to\nput this near the top of your list.\nMichael Kirsch.\nTotal\nRecall\nThis book is so awful that I have no idea\nhow Mr Anthony can put his name to it.\nWhat seems to have happened is that the\nscript for the film was given to him so\nthat he can add bits, and then they\nmarket the result in the hope of making\neven more money.\nThere is no plot\u2014those of you who\nhave seem the film will know exactly\nwhat I mean! The extra parts are very\nfragmented and hard to understand,\nsomething about mutant ants making the\nsun go nova if we are bad?\nIf you are into mass murder and\nmaiming you will be more than satisfied,\nalthough the descriptions are a bit tame.\nNothing to recommend and if you have\nseem the film reading the book will only\nconfuse you.\nIan Hodge.\nExtraordinary People\n'Idiot Savant' is the technical term for\npeople who have brain damage or a mental problem. Yet have an ability that\nwould be extraordinary in a 'normal'\nperson. From amazing musical talent to\ncalendar calculations they show that the\nnormal idea of 'intelligence' is very\nnarrow.\nThis is a book of two halves, initially an\ninteresting and informative account of\none of life's great mysteries which is\nfollowed by what seems to be an extract\nfrom a medical journal. This spoils what\nwould otherwise have been a marvelous\nbook, but even so it is still far better than\nthe average documentary-style book.\nHe does bring up some very interesting\npoints\u2014most of the savants have\nexceptional memory which he suggests\nthat it is more an inability to forget.\nIncluded are three detailed accounts of\nsavants which tell the true story rather\nthan the 'wonder-boy' image that is\npromoted in the press. Reading about\nthese people made me stop and think\nabout the way we should treat people\nthat have mental difficulties, instead of\nlocking them away as we do far too\noften. There is much that we can learn\nfrom them.\nIt is written in friendly and informative\nstyle that makes most of it a joy to read.\nWhen you move into the more technical\n'why does it happen' sections the style\nremains but the subject matter does make\nthings a bit tough.\nWell worth reading.\nIan Hodge\n\n"

    "content": "Toilet Competition? PRIZES\nFollowing the inundation of the FELIX\noffice with entries for the Jim Beam\ncompetition we are running a competition\nof our own.\nThe toilet in the office is boring, it lacks\ninterest and lustre. Not that it is the place\nthat we reside for most of the time, but it\nwould be nice to have better decor. At\nthe moment it is a dingy yellow y white.\nDOOR\nTOILET\nSINK\nWINDOW\nRant Reply\nDear Chris,\nWhen reading the 'RANT' column in the\nfresher s' issue of FELIX, it occurred to me\nthat the author had forgotten two very\nimportant IC stereotypes.\nThe first of these is the 'commuting' IC\nstudent. Usually residing at one of the\nintercollegiate halls of residence, the\ncommuting student can often be seen\ndisappearing into the depths of South\nKensington tube station. Their\ndistinguishing feature is the smug smile\nworn by someone who knows that they\ncan escape the IC campus at will. A favourite topic if conversation for the\ncommuting student is 'other colleges wot\nI have partied at'.\nThe second, and much more noticeable,\nof these forgotten stereotypes is a variation on the 'enthusiast'. Generally\nAbove you will see a plan of the toilet,\nthe walls are approximately two and a half metres and one and a half wide.\nYour challenge is to create an\ninteresting, atmospheric design in\nwhatever style you like. Whether\ncolourful and garish or sombre and\nmoody, infact anything you want. Entries\nshould be drawn, coloured or painted on\nthe plan or an enlarged version.\nThe winner will receive S20 in cash\nand the pleasure of seeing their design\ncome to life. Paints to be provided by us.\nknown as an 'IC Knocker', this beastie\ncan most frequently be found inhabiting\nthe letters page of FELIX. The object of a knocker's enthusiasm is his total lack of\nenthusiasm for anything vaguely related\nto IC. He pursues his cause with all the\ndedication and fer v our that can be\nexpected from a true enthusiast and, like\nall true enthusiasts, he has a one track\nmind when it comes to conversation.\nIndeed, he feels that he cannot tell you\nenough times what a mistake you make\nin coming here. Of late, knocking IC has\nbecome something of a religious cult, the\ntwo sacred commandments of which are:\ni) Thou shalt not like IC (not even a little\nbit).\nii) Thou shalt spread the word of the true\nawfulness of IC to all who would hear the\nword, all who much rather wouldn't and\nall who saye th 'Sod off you bro ing, manic\ndepressive'.\nSo, the profile of IC life is complete. As I watch the last of this year's ex-fresher s pack their bags and head for NetherWallop, I am left to wonder if I am the\nonly one who still thinks that IC is a decent place to be. But, then again, I don't spend all my time there.\nChris Holgate (commuting student in\nElec Eng 2).\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS\nCadillac Man Robin Williams is not in an enviable\nposition. He has had two successive box\noffice smashes (Dead Poets Society and\nGood Morning Vietnam), for both of\nwhich he was Oscar nominated. So far, so\ngood. Now all he has to do is follow\nthem.\n. Superficially Cadillac Man is more\nsimilar to Good Morning Vietnam in that\nRobin Williams is very much the driving\nenergy behind the film\u2014without him it\nwould be nothing. It is, though, an\naltogether lighter effort\u2014a simple, if\ngenuine comedy.\nWilliams plays Joey O 'Brien, who is a man with a problem. He likes to make\nwomen happy. This means indulging in\nrelationships with emotionally draining\nJoy, financially draining Lila as well as\nsupporting his ex-wife and a teenage\ndaughter who is rapidly going out of\ncontrol. Let's not forget his widowed\nmother, either.\nUnsurprisingly this is costing him a lot\nof money, obtained from his job as a car\nsalesman and a rather substantial loan\nfrom a mate in the Mafia. Just to\ncomplete this rosy picture, his job is on\nthe line and so he has one last day to\nprove himself. Things are going well until\nLarry, the husband.of pretty and\nflirtatious secretary Donna smashes\nthrough the window wielding a gun and\nan insatiable curiosity into his wife's illicit\nsex life. It's time for Joey to spin the\nultimate sales pitch.\nSo, Williams gets to dominate the rest\nof the film. Luckily the rest of the cast\nare given rather engaging little character\nsketches to act in, which they do with\naplomb. From the Chinese waitress, to\nthe Russian customer, Joey's world is\nfilled with interesting people. Interestingly\nfrom a nearly all male production staff,\nthe film's strong characters are all\nwomen.\nInitially, the film lacks a 'hook', as we\nare led through the intricacies of Joey's social life. Then Larry arrives, and Joey's talking allows all. The whole film is then\nrendered a little pointless, as all returns\nto an implied pre-film stance, abandoning\nthe set-up that was the comic heart of the\nfilm. Well, it virtually guarantees that we\ncan't get a sequel.\nThis is by no means a great film, but it\nisn't bad. Gently humorous, refreshingly\noptimistic and in fact generally nice. One\nto lift you from a depression. (Hey you're\nat IC you're going to need it.)\nPendragon.\nBarbarians The RSC's present Stratford season has\ngained a formidable reputation, giving the\nbatch of new productions in the Barbican\nquite a challenge. Also in the back of the\nminds of the viewing audience will be the\nfact that these are the last new plays\nbefore the three month close down. A disaster now might be fatal to audience\nnumbers at the reopening.\nBarbarians is not an obvious choice.\nOne of the quartet written by Maxim\nGorky at the beginning of the century, it\ndeals with the coming of a railroad and\nthe attendant construction engineers to a small Russian village. The contrast\nbetween the simple village folk and the\nlanded aristocracy is used throughout the\nthree acts (the play is three hours long\nwith two 15 minute intervals) to explore\nthe nature of each group as they interact\nand affect each other's live, and to\ndetermine who really are the barbarians.\nIt's a weighty topic and a play which\ndoes not immediately strike one as being\nvery accessible. Staging this does not\nseem a wise step for a company in\nfinancial crisis. The reality of the play is\nsomewhat different. Although the\ninevitable themes of coming revolution\nand the arrogance of the aristocracy are\nthere, this new translation brings the\nmore immediate theme of cultures in\nconflict that is relevant today, and will be\nfor the foreseeable future. Backed up\nwith some superb ensemble playing, from\nwhich Louise Jameson (Best known for\nDr. Who and Bergerac, but with great\ntheatre experience) shines forth, bringing\na pivotal and unusual character from a potential clich e to a powerful but subtle\nmotive force.\nThe result? A compelling, even\nenthralling, three hours, at least as\nenjoyable as the current crop of\nShakespeare in the Barbican, and well\nworth the fiver at student standby prices.\nBarbarians is playing in repertoire in\nthe Barbican Theatre, part of the\nBarbican Complex. The nearest tube\nstation is, un surprisingly, Barbican. Arrive\nat the ticket desk half an hour in advance\nfor Student Standbys, waving your brand\nspanking new Union Card.\nAdam T. "

    "content": "Mascotry Bungle\n4 * MA six foot stuffed bear was stolen from\nthe Rag office on Wednesday. The\nowners of the bear, Royal Hollerway and\nBedford New Collage (RHBNC), are\nthreatening legal action to regain\npossession.\nThe bear had originally been stolen\nfrom RHBNC by City and Guilds (C&G) as\na mascot ry stunt to raise money for rag.\nThis backfired when the collage declared\nit to be their property rather than their\nunion's. The collage's line was that the\nremoval of the bear was theft and that\nthey would not pay money to charity to\nrecover it.\nC&G eventually agreed to return the\nbear to RHBNC but it was not collected\nwhen they took it to Padington on a money raising expedition. There \u00a3100\nwas collected for rag.\nThe bear was declared inviolate on\nWednesday morning and placed into the\ncare of Steve Farrant, Rag Chairman. It\nwas from his office that the bear was\nstolen by the Royal Collage of Science\nUnion (RCSU). A key had been obtained\nfrom security but when this was found\nnot to fit, the door was broken down. It\nwas later repaired by an ex-member of\nthe RCS after the bear had been\n'smuggled' out of the Union building\nthrough the Felix office.\nIt is not clear what the RCSU intend to\ndo with the bear although Johnson Hill,\nRCS activist, suggested that they would\nlike to help the RHBNC~8ni on raise\nmoney for charity to pay for the bear.\nWhen Steve Farrant was told that the\nbear had been taken he replied, 'Has it?\nOh, fair enough.'\nDown the\nTube\nA man tried to escape the police by\nrunning along the underground line at\nSouth Kensington tube station late on the\nnight of Saturday 22 September. This\nfollowed a fracas at Southside bar which\ninvolved I.C. students, students from an\nAmerican college and three men be lei ved to be working as contractors at the\nVictoria and Albert Museum.\nRob Northey, Refectories Manager, had\nthe three workmen thrown out at closing\ntime, but they stayed in the area causing\naggravation. One of the men returned to\nthe bar and smashed several windows\nwith an iron rod.\nSecurity guards called the police, and a chase ensued, ending at South Kensington\nStation where the men were arrested.\nThe men are now out on bail.\nRob Northey told Felix that the police\nwere looking for witnesses to identify the\nmen and added 'the next bastard who has\na punch up at Southside I'm going to turn\nthe fire hose on.'\nSell Out\nTonight's Fresher's Ball has sold out.

    "content": "FEATURES\nRoland Flowerdew and Sarah Harland report on the trade flying display from Farnborough this year...\nFarnborough International 1990 v FEATURES\nEvery two years, a quiet airfield in\nHampshire comes to life for a fortnight as\nit hosts the world's largest trade airshow:\nFarnborough International. The peace of\nthe area is shattered as aircraft fly in and\nstart rehearsing their displays, which aim\nto demonstrate how much better they are\nthan the opposition since the clinching of\nrna j or deals can depend on how well a particular aircraft is flown.\nDespite its huge commercial\nsignificance, most members of the public\ncome to Farnborough to marvel at the air\ndisplays, flown by some of the best pilots\nin the world. Although aircraft are\npushed to their limits, each display is\nstrictly controlled and must be approved\nbefore the airshow itself takes place.\nFarnborough is a show of superlatives,\nand this year, as ever, no-one was\ndisappointed.\nFlying began with the McDonnell\nDouglas MD530N NOTAR helicopter,\nmaking its airshow debut. NOTAR,\nstanding for NO TAil Rotor, is a completely new system replacing the\nconventional tail rotor. An internal fan is\nused to pressurize the tail boom,\ncontrolling the torque by ducting the air\nthrough slots. (The system has recently\nbeen described in detail in New Scientist.)\nAdvantages of NOTAR include low\nweight, lower noise, less vulnerability,\nhigher mano eu ver ability and lower pilot\nworkload than associated with tail rotors.\nThese were shown to the full as the pilot\nput the helicopter through a punishing\nand impressive routine that included\nloops and rolls.\nAerobatic basic trainers were in\nabundance this year: Slingsby T67M-200,\nENAER T35 Pillan and Namcu, Shorts\nTucano, Pilatus PC- 9. Each of these gave\na crisp display, but when the nth trainer\nstarts its display, eyes tend to glaze over\nand minds switch off, unless you are\nabout to buy one.\nThere were also plenty of advanced\ntrainers to be seen. The Rhein\nFlugzeugbau Fantrainer 600, flown by\naerobatic champion Walter Extra, from\nGermany, caused more than a few frayed\nnerves, pushing aileron control\ndemonstrations to the knife-edge, and\nlanding on an approach path greater than\n60 degrees to the runway. The aircraft\nhas a single duct ed fan openly housed\nbehind the pilot, leaving the forward\nfuselage free thus providing compactness\nand high cockpit visibility. From\nArgentina, the FMA Pampa is a neat and\nsimple design, with high reliability and\nlow maintenance. It has a straight, super-critical wing (ie configured for low drag\nand high maximum lift etc) and is very\nstable at low speed aileron control, shown\nfrom knife-edge to knife-edge. The IAv\nIAR-99 Soim is the first ever entirely\nRomanian designed and built aircraft to\nperform - even the Rolls Royce Viper is\nassembled there. It is a conventional jet\nMcDonnell-Douglas CF-18 Hornet\ntrainer cum light attack aircraft, but still\nachieves 7000 ft/min climb and 520 mph\nat sea level on maximum take-off weight.\nOnce again, the flying bug, the Optica\ndemonstrated its ability as a low cost\nhelicopter substitute for surveillance. The\nlow noise and low vibration make it an\nideal camera platform, with an eight hour\nendurance surpassing that of helicopters.\nThe Optica has had a chequered history,\nwith the factory being burnt down, the\nmanufacturers going bankrupt and so on,\nbut now current owners Lovaux Ltd are\nhoping to sell up to 100 a year for\npolicing, coast-guard patrol, pollution\nmonitoring and power line surveying.\nWestland provided a dramatic display\nwith the EH101, Black Hawk and Lynx 3\nhelicopters. The EH 101 was displayed in\ncivil he li liner variant, offering a true\nVTOL capability useful for oil-rig support\nand inner city work. The Black Hawk\ndisplay began with a light strike gun lift,\nbut then stunned the crowd by its agility,\nwith an 80 degree rolling dive and sharp\nrolling turns. The Black Hawk has good\nservice ability and an all-up weight of\n22,000 lb resulting in a versatile and\nlethal assault aircraft having the ability to\nwin and hold ground with 19 troops and\n8000 lb external load. The Lynx 3 is used\nin an anti-submarine role by the Royal\nNavy, and has the unusual ability to pin\nitself onto a ship's deck using its negative\nthrust rotor.\nIn comparison to the Black Hawk was\nthe Agusta A129 Mangusta, another low-profile helicopter designed for air-to-air\ncombat and reconnaissance. It can carry\nup to eight TOW missiles, and has a unique on-board computer management\nsystem. With twin engines and 2.5 hr\nmission endurance, the Mangusta is an\nagile and formidable opponent, mission\neffective in all weathers.\nBritish Aerospace (BAe) started its\ndisplay with the two new Hawk versions,\nthe 100 and 200. The 100 is a two-seater\nas in previous versions, but has state-of-the-art avionics. The 200 is a single seat\ndedicated fighter, again with advanced\navionics. Both aircraft displayed the\nmano eu ver ability and effectiveness\nassociated with earlier Hawk variants.\nFollowing the Hawks was an old\nfavourite, the Tornado GR1. Still a head\nturner, this strike two-seater seemed just\nas happy inverted as in normal attitude,\nand also proved very agile with wings in\nfully sept position. Particularly impressive\nwas the way the pilot accelerated around\na360 degree turn whilst maintaining a constant radius. The landing run is\nsurprisingly short, utilising powerful\nreverse thrust.\nOne of the highlights of this year was\nthe six aircraft display of the Harrier GR5\nfrom No.l Squadron on the 30th anniversary of the Harrier and VSTOL\nflight. The GR5 is the latest variant of the\nHarrier, being developed jointly by BAe\nand McDonnell- Douglas. It will carry\neither the same load twice as far as the\nGR3, or double the load the same\ndistance. It has sold to both the USA and\nSpain, and has a much-reduced workload\nfor both pilot and ground-crew.\nThe aircraft demonstrated their\nversatility in a beautifully choreographed\ndisplay incorporating vertical take-offs,\nand short take-offs from both concrete\nand grass. Two opposition 360 degree\nturns at 120 and 350 kts proved\nmano eu ver ability at both ends of the\nspeed range, important in the approach\nto carrier decks and camouflaged strips.\nThe display included high speed ground\nstrikes and explosions before a sync roni sed hovering nod and pirouette\nbefore returning to the ground.\nBAe continued its display with aircraft\nfrom its civil division. After the roar of\nsix Harriers hovering 100 ft from the\ncrowd, anything would seem quiet.\nQuietness is now a very important\nconsideration for civilian aircraft,\nparticularly those expected to operate\nover cities at night, and the BAe 146 is\namong the quietest aircraft in the world.\nThis aircraft was the subject of a massive\npromotion, with three examples at\nFarnborough. The 146 is a regional four-engine jet STOL airliner with advanced\nwing and high bypass turbofan s, and it\nseems likely that it will be allowed to fly\nfrom London Docklands airport soon.\nFlying in Pan-Am livery was the BAe\nJetstream Super 31. This press uri sed turbo-prop commuter biz-jet.boasts a high\ndegree of comfort, and has made its\nbiggest breakthrough into the notorious\nAmerican market. The advanced air screw design gives low noise and high\nefficiency. The ATP also has very\nadvanced air screw design, and is capable\nof using jet ways at regional airports. It\ntoo is very quiet. ,\nLast from BAe was the 125-1000, the\nlatest development of the 125. It should\ncontinue the 125's success, on average\none has been delivered every nine\nworking days since 1964. The rear\nfuselage has been reshaped, giving less\naerodynamic drag and more fuel storage.\nThe 1000 carries six passengers with low\nfuel consumption. So far nine have been\nordered.\nThe Dornier Do228, a square-fuselage d19 seater, or freighter has a bat shaped\nadvanced wing, resulting in incredible\nSTOL performance: it seemed to be in the\nair from take off before it even started\nrolling. It can fly at exceptionally slow\nspeeds - instead of taxiing down the\nrunway it flew - and is remarkable\nmano eu ver able given its size.\nAre vitali sed oldie displayed: a BAC\n1-11 re-engined with Rolls Royce Tays.\nThis upgrade dramatically reduces the\nnoise levels, and provides better\nperformance for less fuel. The 1-11\nairframe is now built in Romania, and this\nnew version should prolong the life of the\nairliner. Smaller, but distinctive, the four-seater CMC Leopard made its flying debut\nas a prototype here. It is a very compact\naircraft, powered by two Noel Penny\nturbojets that look small enough to fit\nunder the bonnet of a Rover Metro. With\nmax cruise of 500 mph at 45,000 ft,\nweight 1900 lb, the Leopard should be on\nsale by 1994 for just under one million\nUS dollars. Another debut, the Embraer\nCBA123 from South America had only\nflown 35 hrs before the show. This light\nregional airliner has two pusher Garret\nTPF351-20 turboprops, also brand new.\nThe fuselage is developed from the\nBrazilia, and has a very high aspect ratio\nsuper-critical wing. It can carry 19\npassengers at 400 mph for nearly 700\nmiles.\nThe Lake Turbo Renegade presented\nanother unusual shape to the air world: it\nis an amphibian with a pusher prop\nmounted over the wings. It carries up to\nsix people, designed primarily for\npleasure use. It was flown by the first\nfemale pilot to display at Farnborough.\nAs always, fighters featured on the\nFarnborough menu. Dassault\ndemonstrated the Alpha Jet 2, and two\nChichester Miles Leopard\nversions of the Mirage 2000, intended to\nfill the gap before the Rafale is\nintroduced. General Dynamics showed its\nF16A Fighting Falcon, and McDonnellDouglas its CF-18 Hornet twin-tailed\nmulti-role fighter. The CF-18 shown was\nfrom the Canadian Air Force, and has a cockpit painted on the underside of the\naircraft to confuse potential attackers.\nThe Soviets displayed some of their\naircraft that have only rarely been seen\nin the West before. Mikoyan displayed\nthe Mig-29, a small but powerful fighter.\nIt has an initial climb rate of 65,000\nft/min, 13,000 mile range and max speed\nof Mach 2.3, and all this from a manual\nhydraulic control system. Sukhoi\ndisplayed its Su-27, similar in shape to the\nMig-29, but larger and with a fly- by-wire\ncontrol system. Both these aircraft gave\nvery impressive displays, including the\nfamous tail-slides, and 'Cobra' manoeuvre,\nwhere the stick is snapped back, putting\nthe aircraft into a vertical attitude, before\ndropping back down and continuing in\nlevel flight.\nThe aircraft that could not be missed\nwas the Antonov An-225 Mriya, the\nlargest aircraft in the world. With a maximum payload of 250,000 kg and six\nengines producing total static thrust of\nover 300,000 lbs, to say that this aircraft\nis impressive is understatement, it only\nflew a few times during the airshow,\nbecause the Soviets could not afford the\nfuel at Gulf-inflated prices. The An-225\nused nearly all the runway to get\nairborne, but when it did finally leave the\nground, the display was awe-inspiring\nwith nimble turns and bank angles\napproaching that looked far too close to\nwing-over for safety. Few people will\nforget the sight of this huge aircraft\ncoming down on finals, dangling 32 huge\ntyres, and then the cloud of smoke as the\nwheels accelerated on touchdown.\nThe Red Arrows gave their usual\npolished display, including a new\nmanoeuvre for the sync ro pair. In the\n'Revolver', both aircraft, flying very close\non a low pass, simultaneously roll\nthrough 360 degrees. In the same\naerobatic vein were two dramatic\naerobatic displays, one from the Extra\n300, the other from the Marconi LO.100\nGliders. The Extra 300, designed, built\nand displayed by Walter Extra, is capable\nof far more than any pilot can take. In\ncontrast, the gliders presented their\nunique and silent display. The two\naircraft fly very close, all the more risky\nwhen there is no power to pull away\nfrom a collision, more so when one flies\ninverted above the other as if there were\nan airborne mirror between them. The\ngliders gave a soothing finale as traders\nand public returned to join the traffic\nqueues which are themselves so much\npart of the air show for the local\nresidents.\n\n"

    "content": "New Model Army Purity LP\nThe Army marches on with a new line-up, a new tour, and a new album,\nImpurity. The cover art-work and photos\nare all typical NMA, beautifully done in\nmauve by Joolz (she of the red hair and\ntattoos). Cackling laughter echoes out of\nthe speakers and NMA fly into Get Me\nOut. This is classic NMA. For the\nuneducated, NMA call themselves 'folk-rock', wear clogs and use loads of Celtic\nimages. The noise they produce is\nreferred to as a 'light metal roar' with\nhard-hitting vocals by Slade the Leveller.\nALL their songs involve political / social\nstatements. About half the album is\npredictable NMA but in amongst it all,\nSpace, Purity and Bury The Hatchet\nprovide a much more acoustic and folk y sound. Space is brilliant and features\nJoolz (the punk poet). Bury The Hatchet\nsays something about the new East-West\nrelations and Luhrstaap gives NMA's view\non a united Germany. In Purity, Slade\neven questions if NMA's ideals are pure\nand righteous. If you are a virgin (to it\nall), have a listen, you may well like what\nyou hear. NMA play the Town and\nCountry Club on October 24 and 25. If\nyou are a follower, it's fan tabi doo sy and\nNMA ate slowly changing.\nColin Toombs.\nFields of the Ne phil im Elyzium LP\nBlack clouds obscure the sun and the\nstormy neo-classical and awesomely\nsmoke-wrought (Dead But Dreaming)\nheralds the Nephs finest achievement so\nfar. The whole album is a single complex\npiece, reminiscent of Marillion's Misplaced\nChildhood in structure, but infinitely more\nevoking and full. The first fights straight\ninto For Her Light. Now in its true\ncontext, the single booms out with more\nstrength and accusation from the mythical\nstart. Then, just as you thought it was\nsafe to cower back to the trembling\nspeakers, Carl McCoy's voice in d ites you\nas you flee back from the magnificence.\nFor the first time, all the lyrics have\nbeen published and read, as the music, in\none long flowing monologue, a pendulum\nbetween emotion and mystique. To read\nthe lyrics alone acts as sacrilege, as\nalone they may be coined as clich e. In\nfact, they jump and soar through the\nintricately powerful guitars, perfectly\nThe Cure complimented by the wandering bass and\ninevitably complex drums to conjure a deeper experience.\nThe delicate majesty of At the Gates of\nSilent Memory is ball adic but not subdued\nuntil memories switch into play to startle\nthe pace to a full bolt. This is a creation,\nnot a composition, as the pure harmonic\nmelancholy of the guitar slices out.\nThrough (Paradise Regained) is reached\nthe eerie simplicity of Submission which\ngrows to a frenzy of darkness and\ndemonic dynamics before subsiding back\nto stillness. The moment is passed.\nTouches of Pink Floydian guitars seep\ninto Sumerland and then on with the\ndriving of Psychonaut but far further\nrefined and varied now, and employing\nmore subtleties than ever. The whole\nmasterfully capped with the tingling\nbeauty of Wail of Sumer which slides\nin perce pt ably into the final majesty of\nAnd There Will Your heart Be Also.\nThis genius provides an hypnotic\nexperience which creates a frame of mind\ntotally incompatible with the frivolity of\neveryday existence. Completely\ncompelling.\nSJH\nNever Enough Single\nBob! What are you playing at? This\ndance y track is a comedy of all that The\nCure are known for by those who don't know them. The Cure mix dance and\nrock and come up with more than\nenough. Loyal fans will probably be\nshocked, but the charts should love it.\nAfter the immense success of\nDisintegration, Robert Smith vowed to\nend The Cure, only to be hounded for\nmore by his disciples. The entire song is\na protest of his inability to quit while the\ngoing's good, all set to some of the .\npopie st music yet written. Like Let's Go\nTo Bed before it, Never Enough tries to\ndestroy all that The Cure stand for in\ntheir fans eyes and in attempting to\ndestroy, he ends up with a hit\u2014jam my sod. It was appa rant ly written on the tour\ncoach en-route to Glastonbury in June!\nThe flip features Harold and Joe, a definite dance track and may well get\nmore air-play than the A side. It's an\ninspiration to the uninspired and almost\nends several times in a sigh and\ncompletely nothing. If only someone\nwould mention what Harold and Joe have\nto do with it except rhyming with 'Go go\ngo'. As if to rub wounded Cure bastions\nwith salt, the 12\" end with a totally out\nof space club mix of Let's Go To Bed, the\ntrack written to destroy The Cure back in\n1985. This is definitely a quick, no-nonsense chart onslaught, and will\nundoubtedly be a hit.\nSJH.\n\n"
