    "content": "If there is something controversial to say about evolution, Richard\nDawkins is usually the one to say it. Ben Wilfdns reports from the launch of his new book 'Climbing Mount Improbable/\n>in\nClimb Every Mountain \"What are flowers for?\" asked Juliet's father as they were driving through the\ncountry, passing fields hill of poppies.\nJuliet pondered the question for some\ntime then replied, \"To make the world\npretty and to help the bees make honey.\"\nIt was with a tinge of regret that Juliet's father, who happens to be Richard\nDawkins, had to tell her that her answer\nwas completely wrong.\nRichard Dawkins, the prominent Darwinist and\nauthor of 'The Selfish Gene', rec end y gave a talk\nat the Institute of Education in London where\nhe discussed some of the ideas in his new book,\n'Climbing Mount Improbable'. Dawkins' books\nare often controversial, and they are particularly unpopular with creationists. His\nlatest book has been described as a \"mas-ter piece of clarity and economy\". It is a testimony to his continuing interest in\nquestions like \"How did we get here?\"\nand \"What is going to happen in the\nfuture?\"\nDawkins comes on stage pushing a large model of a mountain. The side of\nthe mountain that the audience can see\nis a near vertical, unassailable rock face.\n\"Climbing mount improbable is\nmetaphor for the difficulty in evolving\ncomplicated biological design\", explains\nDawkins. He discusses the eye, which is\noften used by creationists as an argument against evolution. \"How could\nsuch a complicated organ have evolved\nby chance?\" they say. Pause for scene\nshifting... Dawkins turns the model\nround to reveal a much gentler slope,\nwith paths and foothills along the way.\nHe explains that in evolution, the ascent\nis only as formidable as the next step.\nThe eye could have evolved by a series of accidents - small steps, starting with the development of a collection of photosensitive cells in a multicellular organism and eventually leading to\nthe multitude of complicated eye designs we see\ntoday. \"Evolution is not just chance\", says\nDawkins. The astronomical improbability of our\nevolution is the problem that all theories of life\nmust solve. Darwinian theory 'smears out' this\nluck into small steps. Through successive generations, luck gets accumulated, culminating in the\nspecies we observe today.\nDawkins then shows a series of\nslides: the potter wasp which builds -ga pot to incubate its eggs in, cater- M pillars which turn into butterflies, symbiotic bacteria which live inside plant cells. Occasionally,\nDawkins cannot remember the name of the\nspecies he is showing and asks if anybody in the\naudience knows. Invariably someone does. \"All\nthese organisms have evolved for the good of\nsomething.\", says Dawkins. The question is who\nor what? What are flowers for? Some of the\n19th century answers to questions like this are\nhilarious. He mentions a few: the louse - an\nincentive for personal cleanliness; garden weeds\n- good for our fitness, cows - to keep our meat\nfresh!\nDawkins' solution is more profound. Things\nevolve for the good of one thing and one thing\nThe Banana. An Atheist's Nightmare Shape. Curves\ntowards the mouth\nConvenient tab\nfor easy opening\nColour, gives visual indication\nof what's inside:\nGreen -not ready to cat\nYellow-ripe and ready to cat\nBrown-over ripe\nBiodegradable wrapper\nNon slip surface\nfor easy grip\nPerforated wrapper\nfor easy peeling\nNot everyone agrees with Dawkin's ideas about evolution. This\nwas sent to him by a creationist.\nonly - DNA. He uses the example of viruses.\nWhat are viruses for? Population control?\nPunishment? No, says Dawkins, viruses are\ncoded programs which say \"copy me and spread\nme around\". This, he believes, is the closest we\ncan get to an answer. Biological viruses are very\nmuch like computer viruses or indeed chain let-ter s. If chain letters manage to spread themselves around using discriminating humans, the\nsame trick will certainly work for a biological\nvirus which is set up to obey in stm ct ions. But what about the elephants and hippos of\nthis world? What are their in stm ct ions saying? To\nDawkins this is a central question. \"The ele-phant's DNA is also saying 'duplicate me', but in\na very roundabout way. The in stm ct ions contain\na fantastically large digression - the elephant!\"\nThis is also true for individual parts of an animal.\nFor example the purpose of a peacock's beak is\nto make more beaks. The beak feeds the peacock so it can survive to reproduce and make\nmore beaks. Similarly, a peacock fan is for picking up peahens and making more nice fans. A flower, as Dawkins will no doubt tell his daughter one day, is like a peacock's fan. Furthermore,\nthe wings of a bee are really the 'wings' of a plant.\nFrom the bee's point of view, it doesn't know\nwhether it is acting under its own instructions or\nthe flower's instructions.\nBut how does all this machinery for spreading genes around get there? \"It's like a computer vim s which has to make its\nown computer first\" says Dawkins. For\nsomething to be truly self-spreading, it\nneeds to be able to make the parts, to\nmake the machinery to make a copy of\nitself. This is the principle of what\nDawkins calls a TRIP (total replication\nof instructions program] robot. An example would be an industrial robot\nwhich could get the raw materials to\nmake another industrial robot. Dawkins\nbelieves that we are all TRIP robots. We\noriginally occurred 4000 million years\nago with the spontaneous arising of a hereditary entity. Next came mutation,\nthen a variant population capable of\nexponential growth. These entities then\nprevailed and the best ones began to\nexercise control over other entities (phe-no type begins). Gradually there was an\nincrease in complexity until we became\nthe TRIP robots we are today.\nDawkins is often accused of having a bleak, cold view of life. One wonders\nwhy he bothers to get out of bed in the morning.\nHis response to this comment is unusual. \"We\nare all going to die. This makes us the lucky ones\n- millions more are never even going to be bom.\nThe potential people who could be here instead\nof me outnumber the number of atoms in the\nuniverse.\" So in the teeth of these stupefying\nodds we are lucky, because it is you and I that are\nhere. Incidentally, Dawkins also believes that science is just about the only supportable occupation there is. \"The universe is 60 million centuries in the past and perhaps another 60 million\nyears in the future... Isn't it a noble way to spend\nour time in the spotlight to try to understand\nwhy we are here?\"\n\n"

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY JUNE 14TH1996 NEWS\nAll change\nat the Lido\nConstruction of a safer, more\nuser-friendly bathing area has\nbeen proceeding around the\nLido Cafe on the Serpentine in\nHyde Park for the past few weeks. The building prog am, involving divers working on\npilings in the Serpentine, should\nbe finished in time for the\nsummer, and has provided an\ninteresting spectacle for customers at the Lido.\nThe Cafe has also undergone an extensive refurbishment\nsince last season, changing into a much more commercialised operation. PHOTO: IVAN CHAN News in brief\nMore storeys for books\nBY TIM ST.CLAIR\nAt the 6 pm meeting on the 6 th of June, Westminster Council approved item 6 on the agenda:\nextensive plans for improvement\nof the library facilities.\nWork has already begun to\nstrengthen the building's foundations preparatory to the addition\nof the extra floors, projected to\nbegin in July. The main entrance\nwill be closed over the summer\nas work begins on the lift shafts,\nand a temporary entrance and\nissue desk will be set up on level\ntwo, accessible via Sherfield.\nThe main entrance will be\nre-opened in October, although\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nThe IC Boat Club Manager Bill\nMason will lead a women's rowing team to the Atlanta Olympics this summer. The women's eight won the selection\nregatta in Lucerne last weekend,\nbreaking the course record and\nsetting the third fastest time\never. The American team had\nbroken the course record the\nweekend before, only to have it\nsmashed by the British.\nThe team, who come from\naround the country, will join IC work will continue on the roof\nand lifts. The new-look lobby\nwill incorporate a larger bookshop than the one presently on\nSherfield walkway. In April 1997\nthe main stair case will be\nextended to the fifth floor.\nIn order to minimise the\ndisruption to study during the\nbuilding work, loan allowances\nwill be extended, permitting\nstudents to borrow more books\nso they can study elsewhere.\nThe plans are on display in\nthe library, and further information will be available from the\nlibrary homepage on http://-www.lib.ic.ac.uk/\nBoat Club Coach Steve Ellis on\nthe British Olympic, rowing\nsquad.\nIC Boat Club had further\nsuccess in last weekend's London\nDocklands regatta. They entered\na total of ten events, coming\naway with gold in seven of them.\nTheir successes included winning\nthe Men's Senior Open Eights on\nboth days, the Women's Senior\nOpen on Sunday. The men's firsts also won the Open Eight\nand Open Four events on both\ndays.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nAnother bill from\nthe VAT man\nImperial College could face a extra VAT bill of as much as\n\u00a340,000 annually after a ruling\nthis week. An exemption clause\nwhich meant that charitable\ninstitutions, including universi-ties, didn't have to pay VAT on\nstaff recruitment advertising has\nbeen revoked.\nOnly last year Imperial's staff newspaper, The IC\nReporter, ran a competition to\nfind an appropriate VAT slogan.\nBut the slogan: At the leading\nedge oj research, innovation and\nlearning will no longer be enough\nto give IC exemption from tax\nbills.\nJazz & rock mystery\nConcerns over the safety of the\nJazz and Rock club's equipment\ncame to a head this week when a large power amplifier was\nreported missing.\nThe amplifier had not been\nseen for a couple of weeks before\nits disappearance was noted, as\nthe Jazz and Rock club's chairman wasn't available to confirm\nthat it actually existed. The\nchairman, Stefan Finch, has been\nstudying for exams recently and\nhas not been able to attend to the\nclub, which has cast doubts on\nthe club's accountability.\nThe Social and Cultural\nAmusements Board, under\nwhose authority Jazz and Rock\nfalls, received two queries as to\nthe whereabouts of the equip-ment. Mr Finch was able to identify what was missing at a meeting on Tuesday.\nSCAB executive officers\nhave been worried lately over the\nJazz and Rock club, as the soci-et y's organisation seems opaque.\nAlso, since Jazz and Rock club\nofficers have been unable to\nattend SCAB meetings recently,\nthere has been a lack of response\nto members concerns. As Felix\nwent to press, there have been no\nreports as to the whereabouts of\nthe amplifier.\nLecturers against\nloans\nAt its conference last week, the\nlecturers' union Natfhe voted\nagainst the Labour party shift\nfrom student grants to loans.\nReflecting the growing militancy\nin university teachers worried\nabout job security, the union has\ndecided to set up a 'battle plan'\nto lobby against continuing job\ncuts in the higher edu action sector. They plan to set up a strike fund to cover possible\nindustrial action by lecturers.\nBoatclub's Bill to lead UK\nOlympic rowing team\n\n"

    "content": "simon baker\nIt would seem that times\nare hard. Imperial needs our\nsupport. Or rather Imperial\nneeds it support back,\nnamely its supply of\" crutch-es. It appears that students\nat IC have not only broken\nbones but also the nth commandment by pinching\nthese appa rat i, resulting in a very cross Director\nof Clinical Services. Dr Irene Weinreb (the little-known sixth Python?) is clearly keen to retrieve\nsaid equipment by using the ultimate threat of\nRegulation 2. It strikes me that you should not\nhave let this situation get so ridiculously out of\ncontrol, because if you withhold degrees pending\nreturn of crutches, you will not only be the\nlaughing stock of the British University system,\nbut also give the tabloid press a field day. As any\ndoctor should know, playing with fire invariably\nresults in nasty burns.\nI had hoped that I would not need to drone\non about the activities of the good folk in College\nEstates this week, but when such blatantly stupid and thoughtless work as the Weeks path is\ncarried out, I am left with no option. My initial\nreaction was puzzlement as to why the path was\nessential to provide students with access to the\ngardens. The north face of the Eiger it is not, and\nwhile a path is necessary to prevent the lawn\nfrom being worn down in tire long term, the timing of the work leaves much to be desired. Why\non earth could it not have been carried out over\nEaster or during the summer, thus avoiding the\ndisruption to students' revision? I was discussing\nthis very point with one of my envoys in\nSherfield a few days ago and was immediately\nput in the picture. \"Can't be done any later,\" he\nsaid, \"because there is a big event taking place in\nthe garden on Wednesday, some very important\npeople present.\" Ala, dear reader, everything is\nclear. All that flannel about being 'sensitive to\nexam pressures' is starting to ring a little hollow.\nWhat we have here is yet another cock-up by\nEstates, a department where use of the word\n'planning' is a disciplinary offence. Obviously the\npath is needed if 400 people are to be at the\nRector's Town and Gown summer reception,\nbut yet again a total absence of foresight has\nresulted in work being carried out at the last\nminute, rather than choosing a time earlier in the\nyear, safely before the exams. And yes, Mr\nCaldwell, \"some students may not believe\" that\nyou are sensitive to exam pressures. Such understatement deserves a medal.\nThe Private Finance Initiative got the\nNooman Haque treatment last week, and very\ngood it was too. I agree that the scheme is not tai-lor-made for Universities, but then this was not\nthe intention, as a result of the greater freedom\nthat higher education institutions enjoy.\nNevertheless, it is a useful option in certain cases.\nQuite why the notion that \"the PFI is largely to\nreduce the government's public, deficit\" is cynical is a mystery to me. Of course the PFI is\ndesigned to cut government spending, and if this\nwere not a primary aim,\nthe policy would be mere\npolitical posturing. I fail to\nsee why public spending\nshould be lavished on huge\ncapital projects when an\nalternative exits. Obviously\nthe main target of the PFI\nis transport infrastructure,\nwhich lends itself well to\nprivate sector involvement. As the article stated,\nthere have been tee tli ing troubles, such as the\nexpensive and woefully slow tendering process,\nbut when this is resolved, companies will be\nmuch more eager to get involved. I also don't believe that the ultimate ownership of these constructions is a problem, be it a road, a hospital or,\nas the article suggested, a lab in College. Quite\nfrankly, the Moonies can take over ownership of\nthe third year lab which I was working in until\nrecently if it results in an improvement of the\nfacilities.\nCollege services are probably most suitable\nfor PFI-type deals. Car parking has already been\ndone but the prime target, the ultimate goal, the\npiece de resistance must be College Catering.\nBritish Leyland in the 1970s was a model of\nmanagement practice in comparison with the\nfiasco responsible for feeding hungry mouths at\nImperial, and also lost less money. However, any\nsuch deals must be handled very carefully.\nWholesale transfer of Catering to an outside firm\nwould disastrous. What, I hear you cry, is he say-ing? Is he going soft in his old age, letting his capitalist ideals slip? Rest assured, I'm not cracking\nup. My concerns can be summarised in two\nwords. Southside Bar. The jewel in the crown of\nCatering and Imperial as a whole, any attempt to\ninterfere with its operation would inevitably\nharm it for the simple reason that it can't get\nmuch better. In such examples, like local authority tendering, the PFI is intended to kick-start\nsloppy, unprofitable organisations, descriptions\nwhich apply to Southside with the validity of\nfavourable comparisons between Southside\nShop and Kwik Save on price grounds. In gene r al, Mike Hansen does seem to talk a lot of sense,\nwhich is not something you can say about many\nsenior Sherfieldites. Mind you, let me make a small point on that score. I wouldn't trumpet our\ncommon heating system as triumph of cooperation in the Chemistry department. This is the\nsystem which has all the fine control of a sledge\nhammer in neurosurgery, ensuring that the building is about 95\u00b0C every day of the year, except\nfor a week or two in early November, when the\nfrost forms on the inside of the windows.\nFinally, I can confirm that it's safe to con-s ume. Not beef, but the material on 'Saturday\nLive', ITV's new comedy extravaganza. I know\nthat funny comedy on ITV is as bountiful as free\nthinking in the Shadow Cabinet, but this time\nthey've managed to pull it off. Harry Hill was\nbrilliant, Alistair McGowan was perfect, that\nmad Dutch blok e was hilarious and Lee Hurst\nwas so-so. They're onto a winner, folks.\n\n"

SEVEN\nOR m smT? Given the current sporting climate, arc foo to a Her s aware that the l chances of dying on the pits h in any\none year are one n twenty five thou san||I think\nthey should be it old. The inconsistent behaviour of the public with the\nodds can be explained Py their incorrect assessment\nof the risk. Thus with road crossing, we know (impersonally) of millions who have presumably crossed the\nroad safely y^au ii elves, but we actually know very\nfew oe oo e who have died from this act. With too\nlarge a sample size, we are destined to downplay the\nreal risk of cr css. ng ;no road.\nThe current: fur pre tp ver BSE contrasts strongly wit ff the aPo ve case, Pecause millions of people have\nplayed up the infinitesimal iy small chances of contracting CJD from eating beef. Faced with this, we\nwould exo ect those with knowledge of these matters to provide some security. We generally do not\nexpect Peef to kill, so when evidence shows that it\nmay, the actual probability is exaggerated.\nWhilst the public cry out for a statement\nof certainty, the scientist can only reply\nwith a statement of probability based on\nassessment of the available data. Thus\nthe real truth' changes over time. That\nis how science progresses. Scientists\ndon't offer certainty - indeed they are\ncareful in their wording never to use\nwords like certainty' or impossibility'.\nScientific truth' is merely an assessment\nof probability. There are no absolutes.\nThis is the public misunderstanding of\nscience.\nFortunately for the public, politicians are only too\npleased to offer the certitude which the scientist\nrefuses to, and in so doing set themselves up for\nfiascos like the beef crisis. All it takes is one so late d case to contradict the official line, \"there is\nabsolutely NO risk,\" and the result is blind panic. Risk\nis perceived out of all proportion to the actual\nthreat. Our perception seems to depend on whether\nwe require somebody else to do the analysis for us\n(beef) or if we think we have all the information\nneeded to form a correct assessment of risk for ourselves (road crossing). Given the natural tendency\nfor the public to misunderstand science, and the\nbias for 'me' to believe 'myself more than I believe\n'you' it'shar gly surprising.that the public's behaviour appears mau |\nf The word of a scientist is even more suspect?\nf he or\nshe not only says! \"X is probable in 1000 trials,\" but\nthen continues, \"But it still might not happen, even\nin 1000 trials.\" In the face of this apparent paradox,\nthe public feel even more comfort a Ple with their\nown assessment of danger. That is why they continue to play football. Of course they are right to do so,\nprecisely because a statement of proP ability relating\nto death in a football match is not a statement of\ncertainty.\nAttempting to understand behaviour is f uther com-sounded by the human tendency to form patterns,:\nto be ether extremely, cautious or optimistic, and\nto attach importance to events which are nothing\nmore than coincidence. (Did you know that the\nprobability of you sharing a birthday with somebody\nelse in your lecture is very close to one?) In fact,\nhumans are anything but rational.\nCoincidences are spooky, and spooky things scare\npe oo e. In order to explain something spooky we\nturn to religion, tarot cards, tea leaves, astrology,\npalm readers, or any one of a massive arn v of people in whom we place our trust (and money l, in\nreturn for a prediction or assessment of the future.\nThe popularity of such activities is a reflection of the\nscientist in all of us - what are the men in white\ncoats, if not agents attempting to explain causality\nand predict the future course of events7. Meanwhile the pensioner walked out of\nthe post office and crossed the road in\nfront of an oncoming bus. She speeded\nup and was clearly exerting her frail\nheart, it occurred to me then, that my\nsearch for the truth concerning the lottery was over. As a statement of probability, no matter how unlikely, It could\nbe you' was the truth.\nby Nooman Haque\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY JUNE 14TH1996 NEWS\nSuicide attempt by jilted boyfriend\nBY ROBIN RILEY\nAn ambulance and two lire-engines were called to Tizard\nHall in Princes Gardens on\nSaturday night following the\nattempted suicide ol a female\nresident's ex-boyfriend. The\npresence of so many emergency\nvehicles worried a number of\nSouthside residents into thinking\nthat there had been a major fire\nin the building.\nThe couple had reportedly\nbeen in a relationship for two-and-a half years before splitting\nup, at her instigation, nine\nmonths ago. They are not\nthought to have spoken for the\nlast eight months, although the\nboyfriend is believed to have\nunsuccessfully attempted to reestablish communication through\na series of letters.\nEvents came to head on\nSaturday when the boyfriend\nentered Tizard Hall at around\n7pm, in a state of some distress,\nand pleaded with the female resident for a reconciliation. When\nthis finally proved to be of no\navail the young man, who is not\nan Imperial College student,\nattempted to take his own life by\nswallowing a large number of\ntablets, possibly a mixture of\nparacetamol and sleeping pills.\nHe is also thought to have been\ndrinking heavily beforehand.\nAt this point the young\nwoman left the room and alerted\nTizard sub warden Colleen Lee,\nwho in turn contacted College\nsecurity and Tizard Hall's Warden, Dr John Hassard of the\nphysics department.\nMs Lee and Dr Hassard then\nadministered emergency detoxifying treatment using powdered\ngraphite before the arrival of the\nemergency services. Following\nfurther intensive treatment by\nambulance crewmen and in\nhospital that night, the patient\nwas pronounced 'out of danger'\nat around L30am on Sunday\nmorning. He discharged himself\nlater that afternoon.\nAs an additional precaution,\nthe young man, whom has not yet\nbeen named, is to receive counselling in order to help him\nrecover from his obsession and\nthe events of Saturday night.\nAlthough Southside Halls\nwere evacuated after a fire alarm\nwhich sounded during the in ci dent, widespread rumours that\nthe man tried to set fire to his ex-girlfriend and her room are\nuntrue. There had been suggestions that the man had brought\ntwo petrol cans into the hall with\nhim. The emergency services sent\ntwo fire-engines around half an\nhour later.\nThis incident comes just 18\nmonths after a suicide attempt in\nSelkirk Hall, of which John\nHassard is also Warden. Speaking\nto Felix, Dr Hassard commended\nMs Lee on her prompt action,\nand pointed out that the Tizard\nHall Subwardens were already in\na heightened state of awareness\nto the presence of intruders\nfollowing a series of thefts from\nthe Hall's games machines.\nFurniture in the Selkirk Hall television lounge was vandalised last\nweekend.\nDr Hassard went on to say:\n\"This is a very sad story... It is sad\nhow someone can become\nobsessed in this way. We must all\nbe vigilant of strangers, and\nremember that there is no security in Halls except for that that\nthe students provide them-selves.\" \u2022\nThe incident has once again\nraised questions over the security\nof students in Halls, and their\nvulnerability to intruders creeping into the buildings.

Although Mr Karian has\ntaken up a full time position, he\nhas not resigned his ULU presidency, the contract of which is\ndue to run until the end of July.\nThe first of two motions\ntabled seeks to censure Mr\nKarian for his involvement in the\nNew Solutions lobby group. The\nmovement won a recent victory\nwith the reversal of the NUS's policy of campaigning to return\nstudent grants to 1979 levels.\nThe second proposes a vote of no\nconfidence in the ULU pre si dent, a move that Imperial\nCollege Union's delegates to the\nGUC have been mandated to\nsupport.\nIf the motion of no confidence is passed, Mr Karian will\nhave been effectively sacked,\nleaving unfinished the ULU work\nwhich he has continued to do.\nAdditionally, he would no longer\nbe required to be present during\nthe ULU sabbaticals handover\nperiod when the incoming officers are trained. This could jeo pardi se the training of ICU\nPresident Sarah White, who was\nelected as next year's ULU president last month.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Karian\nwas in a unrepentant mood: \"I could have walked away from\nULU, |but| I 've been at government committees, finance meet-in gs, a million and one meetings,\nunpaid.\" He said QMWs Union\nofficers were \"petty politicians,\nwho have nothing better to do\nContinued on page three\nmm\n' PHOTO: ROBIN RILEY\nSecurity swoops on bikes\nBY ROBIN RILEY\nStudents cycling to the Chemistry and Biochemistry departments on Tuesday were stunned\nto find that bikes previously\nattached to railings outside the\nbuildings had been summarily\nremoved by Security, with little\nwarning.\nThe bikes removed had\napparently been unused for some\ntime and were considered a fire\nhazard by Security. When asked\nabout the relative flammability\nof a pair of bicycles as compared\nto the chemistry department\nitself, Ken Weir, IC's head of\nSecurity, refused to be drawn, he\nclaimed that the bikes were\nattached too close to the main\ndoors and would hinder escape\nfrom the buildings in an emer-gen cy. At the time of going to press,\nno-one has come forward to\nclaim the bikes. When asked if\nthe missing owners would be able\nto reclaim their D Locks, Mr\nWeir refused to comment,\ninstead stating \"I would prefer\npeople to use the bicycle racks\nprovided in future.\"\nLibrary as planned\nWith considerably greater ease\nthan for the BMS building, planning permission for the library\nextension has been granted first\ntime.

    "content": "film: the confessional n ny h< The Confessional starts with Pierre Lamontagne\n(Lothaire Bluteau) returning to Quebec in 1989\nto attend the funeral of his father, Paul-Emile,\nwho died blind after neglecting his diabetes. He\nmeets up with his\nadopted brother Marc,\nan illegitimate child who\nhas begun to question\nhis identity. Together,\nthe brothers embark on\na quest to find out who\nMarc's father really is.\nThe film switches\nback and forth between\nmodern day and the\n1950s, often within a single shot which conveys the power that the\npast exerts over the pre-sent.\nIn 1952, Alfred\nHitchcock is shooting /\nConfess in the parish\nchurch in Quebec City,\nwhere Paul-Emile is\nworking nights as a taxi\ndriver. He and his wile\nFrancoise share a house\nwith Rachel, Francoises sixteen year-old sister.\nRachel works in the presbyter y of the parish\nchurch and is pregnant. Filled with shame, she\nseeks salvation in the confessional and, trusting to\nthe vow of silence, makes a confession to a young\npriest who is suspected to be the father.\nA senior civil servant seems to hold the key\nto the confession and the truth surrounding\nMarc's birth. Past and present fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and reveal\nclues to the audience as\nthey watch a family\ntragedy and a mystery\nunfold.\nThe Confessional is a British, French and\nCanadian co-pro duc tion-part produced by\nDavid Puttnam.\nLothaire Bluteau makes\nfor an unlikely leading\nman material while\nthere are rare and brief\nappearances by Kristin\nScott Thomas (Four\nWeddings and a Funeral) as the assistant\nto Alfred Hitchcock.\nThe film starts slowly\nbut proceeds to tell an\nintriguing tale. The\nConfessional is challenging viewing and offers\nthe audience the opportunity to question how\nsacred the word of confession should be. As an\nart film, it is stimulating and thought provoking\nwithout losing its entertaining aspect.\nbook: excess ion iain m. banks.\u2122!,K It is 6.30pm on Wednesday night. Five of us are\nsitting at the back of a300 strong audience in the\nLyttelton Theatre. Iain (Menzies) Banks has just\nwalked onto the stage, accompanied by Oliver\nMorton, the UK editor of Wired magazine.\nWired ran an interview with Iain in their June\nissue along with a preview extract from his new\nnovel Excession, lor which Iain is now doing the\nbook-signings and talks.\nSince the new book is a science fiction novel\nset in Iain's previously-visited galaxy of the\nCulture, the topic of conversation centres\naround the general ideas ol the Culture, as\nopposed to the specifics ol a book which few of\nthe audience would yet have read.\nThe Culture is a Utopian \"post-scarcity\"\nsociety of humanoids and machine intelligence.\nAsked whether he would still describe it as 'an ar chic-communism', he replies, \"Only when I'm talking to a load of right wing American writers,\"\nraising one of many laughs. Since it is Utopian,\nstories set within typical every-day circumstances would be what Iain disparaging ly calls\nHampstead novels'. Hence the novels take\nplace within the Culture's 'Contact section',\nwhich interacts with other societies. In\nExcession, the appearance of an object of technology superior to that of the Culture triggers\nthe machinations of various groups which form\nthe story. The machine intelligence s are the main\nprotagonists here, and this new viewpoint on the\nCulture is particularly welcome, seeing that it is\nthey who effectively mn the Culture.\nAfter about 25 minutes the audience is\nasked for questions. The first is a standard\n\"Films?\" and the answer is more specific than I have previously heard. The BBC are in the\nprocess of filming The Crow Road, and the result\nwill be shown in the autumn. His more standard\nanswer follows - that Hollywood can have\nConsider Phlebas, give it a happy ending and\nstick Arnie in as the hero - just so long as all those\ngreat scenes are done!\nThe other main question is which authors\nhe personally reads. His first answer, describing\nhow as a teenager he would simply look around\nthe library for the yellow Victor Gollanz books,\nstruck a strong chord. When it came to more\nrecent specific books, I was not surprised at his\nchoice of Dan Simmonds' Hyperion. That has\none scene, involving satellites, personal communicators and a lot of gore which, on reading, I thought, \"Iain Banks could have written that!\"\nIain has a further four-book deal, two SF\nand two mainstream, which means I have at\nleast four books to look forward to over the next\nfive years.\nr ellul oid guide:\n'\"'\u2022\"SM \u00a5M?l?:^ J^i,M:\\ M0WM_MMffM'M'' \u2022\n:.lv cv is. ii/ WMMM\" \u2022\n-/j M MiM Z.'IP' c ifPi.!> \u00a3f,'!

Well, certainly a spot less cynicism, which\nis pretty good going for me. But\nnot any more.\nFirstly I'm really disappointed about the Rector's Town and\nGown summer reception. I had\nbeen completely charmed by Ian\nCaldwell's story: he was really\nsorry about disturbing the Weeks\nstudents, but hey, we had their\nbest interests at heart, we\nthought they'd like somewhere\nquiet and peaceful outside to\nrevise in. Somewhere peaceful to\nrevise in, my foot. 400 members\nof the Knightsbridge Association\nfor tea, that's what.\nBesides, I wasn't invited. It's utterly unreasonable: there you\nare, elected for position to the\n1995-96 IC students' union sabbatical team, all getting abuse\nfrom the drunk medics together.\nWhere are we now? Sarah White\ngets to go to the Rector's Town\nand Gown summer reception,\nand I get to spend all night stapling whilst getting hate mail\nfrom disgruntled Security\nGuards.\nAnd while we're on the the\nsubject of Student Union\nPresidents, I am entirely sick of\nthe political machinations of\nGhassan Karian. This man may\nhave two important sounding\njobs. He may be the chief\nGeneral Election Campaigns\nCoordinator for West London\nfor the Labour Party. He may be\nthe figurehead of the largest student body in the country. But he\nclearly has difficulty filling his\ntime. Alex Feakes phoned up\nKate Hampton (the LSE\nPresident) to ask about their anti\nno-confidence motion (or something like that). A couple of\nhours later, and all hell had broken loose: Kate had told Ghassan\nwho called Sarah who passed the\ncall on to me to say that she said\nthat he said that she said that he\nsaid that you're going to write a nasty article about me. Well I certainly will now, mate. It is my\nconsidered opinion that the\nUniversity of London Union is an\nutter waste of time. A great\nvenue, yes, a centre for student\nadvice/welfare/travel certainly,\nbut as a body of student opinion\nit is made entirely irrelevant by\nthe autonomy of its constituent\ncolleges.\nOr, to put it another way, I am a little concerned that the\nStudent Union Presidents of\nLSE, Imperial and the University\nof London (amongst others) have\nnothing better to do than decide\nwhether they have confidence in\neach other.\nEDITORIAL TEAM: NEW S:ALE XFE A KES FEATURES: MARK BAKER SUB EDITING AND PROOFING: TIM ST CLAIR MUSIC: VI KB AN SAL CINEMA: KATIE HOPKINS& WEI LEE\nPHOTOGRAPHY: IVAN CHAN PUZZLES: CATFISH CLUBS AND SOCS: STEPHEN HAMILTON ARTS: JEREMY SCIENCE: BEN WILKINS COLLATING LAST WEEK: TIM, DAN, ROBIN "

Kate Hampton, the\nLondon School of Economic\nUnion's General Secretary, said\nthat she and her delegates would\nbe supporting the move to\ncensure Ghassan at the very least,\nsaying that most colleges are\n\"extremely angry at Ghassan.\"\nMr Karian's defection to\nanother job so quickly after the\nULU elections has been\ndescribed as \"cynical\" in some\nquarters. Many suggest that he is\nputting unreasonable pressures\non his successors, while others\nsuggest that the implications if he\nhas to completely break links\nwith ULU are even worse. These\nfears could be behind the tabling\nof a motion of confidence by\nClaire Lawrie of LSE, one of next\nyear's ULU sabbatical officers.\nWith particular reference to\nthe ICU support for the no-confidence motion, Mr Karian\ncomplained that he hadn't been\ngiven a chance to defend himself\nat the Council meeting where the\nGUC delegates were mandated\nto back it. He said that \"justice\nwasn't done,\" because the delegates are now obliged to vote\nagainst him regardless.

IC Estates\nDirector Ian Caldwell and ICU\nPresident Sarah White were\ncalled to the scene.\nOnly around fifty of the\naudience were Imperial students\nor staff. College staff were\nparticularly concerned that the\nevent had been advertised\noutside Imperial: the promotional leaflets, written in Farsi,\nwere clearly designed for non-IC\nstudents, giving directions from\nSouth Kensington Station. \"They\nsay that someone else organised\nthe advertising, but if they can't control it they can't be trusted to\nrun events,\" Sarah said. \"They've\nshown that they're incapable of\norganising an event properly.\"\nThe speaker, Dr Abdul\nKarim Sonosh, a well-known\nIranian philosopher, is known to\nScotland Yard.
