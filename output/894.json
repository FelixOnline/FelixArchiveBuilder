    "content": "Alien Sex Fiend investigates sex, violence and social prejudice... oh, and comics.\nFEATURES Kids Stuff... or are they?\nZap!... Pow!... Khzammm!\n'Take that, evil fiend! Your plans to\nrule the world are no more!'\nAnd another muscle-bound idiot in a silly costume puts paid to another\nscheming evil mastermind, only to find\nthat the bad die has escaped, and the\nwhole pointless charade will be reenacted next issue.\nWhen most people think of comics, this\nis the kind of scenario that runs through\ntheir mind, or maybe a fond\nremembrance of the childhood days of\nThe Beano or Bunty. It's hardly\nsurprising: We live in a society that\nregards the comic as a childish medium,\nand are thus brought up with this attitude\ntowards them.\nBut why is this? Comics did not, as\nmost people think, start out being aimed\nat children, but at the same age groups as\nmost popular fiction. Superman, the figure\nthat arguably started it all, was created in\nthe early Forties. At this time the strip\nwas avidly read by a wide variety of the\nAmerican people, from children to\nteenagers, to college students and\nbeyond. Batman began as a much darker,\nmature figure than he later became in the\npublic eye.\nSo what changed? Well, that's the\nproblem: we did, and they (the comics)\ndidn't. The world we live in has been\nchanging at an eve i increasing rate. With the advent of information technology, and\nthe growth of the media industry, people\nbegan to see more of the world they\nlived in, and to understand a little more\nof its workings. As we have become more\naware and educated, our understanding\nof ourselves and our society was affected.\nThis has lead to us placing different\ndemands on the arts and entertainments\nthat are meant to be relevant to the\nfluctuating world in which we live.\nThis is the reason that past fictional\nworks, of any medium, can lose some of\ntheir appeal. They become less believable\nand credible when viewed with our\ngreater understanding. This is not to say\nthat they are not enjoyable, but in a different way, and often with a sense of\nnostalgia, thus making it very hard to\nsuspend our disbelief. This suspension of\ndisbelief is vital if a work of fiction is to\nhold our attention and have an impact\nupon us.\nTelevision was one of the main forces\nbehind these changes, transferring a huge\namount of information to first hundreds,\nthen thousands, and now millions of\npeople. As such it was able to keep up\nwith the transformation of people's demands. (Although it could be said that\nit was forced to by its very nature). The\nfields of cinema and literature have dealt\nINTD f*ff lAJ Cm with the phenomenon with differing\nlevels of success, but have generally\nmanaged to keep up, so to speak.\nThen of course, we come to comics.\nWhy have they not been able to change\nalong with other forms of fiction? The\nmain reason can be traced back to the\nMcCarthy era of American history. In this\nparanoid frenzy of investigations all\nproducers of fictional work were heavily\nscrutinized, and a huge amount of\npressure put upon them. The comic book\nindustry was all but destroyed by a group\nof senate house committee hearings,\nwhich amounted to a witch hunt on\ncomic book creators. The main focus of\nthese purges was EC Comics, the original\nmasters of the horror comic, but in their\nalmost ecclesiastical zeal the whole\nElektra: Assassin\nindustry was subjected to a concentrated\nattack. Companies went out of business,\nand some of the best artists and writers\nwere forced to find employment in other\nfields, and even began denying that they\nhad ever been involved in comics. So\nmuch for the 1st Amendment.\nThe remaining companies were faced\nwith a choice (?): Clean up or close down.\nIn order to survive they formed the\nComic Code, a self-regulating body whose\njob was (and still is) to make sure that the\nAmerican youth only read comic books\nthat were pure and wholesome. Violence\nwas reduced to a bare minimum, and sex\n(previously unheard of) became totally\ntaboo.\nThe consequences of this are still with\nus today. Comic books (especially\nMarvel's output) became nice and clean\nand wholesome. And bland, and silly, and\nsimple minded, and boring. At the same\ntime the information technology and\nmedia boom got under way. This lead to\na change in the readership of the books.\nThe older readers, becoming more aware\nof their society and themselves,\ndemanded more than the comic books\nwere giving, and thus stopped reading\nthem. Thus the average age of the\nreadership fell. As the readership became\nyounger the writers were forced to aim\nthe comics at this age group, or risk\nfalling sales. Then there was the abysmal\nBatman TV series, which made a farce of\none of the biggest comic heroes in the\npublic's eye. All of this led to society's perception of comics becoming that\nwhich is typical today: Comics are for\nkids.\nBut things have changed. It began as\nearly as the late sixties. Some writers\nbecame slightly more ambitious. They\nRt \u20ac * ff cms ui TMS\nmn \u20ac * er mu\nThe Dark\nKnight Returns\nI( Frank Miller)\nwas the\ncatalyst for a revolution in\nthe comic\nbook industry.\nbegan to produce slightly more mature\nstories, and managed to get them past the\n(by then) slightly more relaxed Comic\nCode. This happened in various titles, but\nmainly those produced by Detective\nComics (the producers of Batman,\nSuperman, Wonder Woman, et al). It was\nby no means consistent, and there were\nmany periods where stories got silly\nagain, but the spark was there.\nThen came the Eighties, and with them\na man called Frank Miller. Miller was\nsomething of a wild card, coming out of\n(apparently) nowhere, working as an\nindependent, and producing his first major\nrelease, a graphic novel called Ronin,\nvirtually single-handedly (ie he wrote and\ndrew it himself). He then worked his way\nthrough various characters from various\ncompanies, redefining them with a far\nmore modern, mature and complex\nviewpoint. His work quickly became very\npopular within the small group of comic\nenthusiasts, those die-hard fans that\nhadn't left their comics with their romper\nsuits. At the same time several other\nwriters and artists had begun\nexperimenting with more ambitious ideas.\nMarvel Comics had introduced a character, Wolverine, who by his very\nnature was a killer (a first for the\ncompany), and various other titles were\nbecoming more serious.\nBut the turning point for the whole\nindustry came with Miller, and Batman.\nAfter having gained a large amount of\nrespect and following in the industry after\nhis work on Marvel's Daredevil, Detective\nComics let him go ahead with a Batman\nstory. The result was a four-part limited\nseries, now reprinted as a graphic novel,\ncalled The Dark Knight Returns. It caused\na storm. Miller had taken one of the most\nfamous comic heroes of all time, who was\nboth engraved on the minds of comic\nfans worldwide, and who epitomized the\nessential silliness of comics to the general\npublic (due largely to the TV series), and\ntotally redefined him into a modern hero,\nwithout contradicting any of the work\nthat had been done before. By doing this\nhe dramatically demonstrated not only\nthat comics aren't limited to dealing with\nchildish stories, but also that one of the\nmost 'silly' characters wasn't very silly\nafter all.\nThe Batman had been portrayed over\nthe years in various ways, originally as a darker, revenge driven vigilante, and\nthen for most of the Sixties and Seventies\nas a rich, concerned do-good er. In Miller's hands he retained both these aspects, but\nWolverine\nbecame something far more. By incorporating these elements, and his\nown interpretations, Miller showed us a far more complex character than had\nbeen seen before in a comic. He\ncombined this with another groundbreaking concept in comics: Time. The\nDark Knight Returns is the story of the\nBatman's future, of his old age. By making the Batman's character complex,\nMiller transformed him from a hero to a man, and with the addition of time, into a legend.\nThe Dark Knight Returns was the\ncatalyst for a revolution in the comic\nbook industry. Its sales were huge, it\ncrossed the age boundaries set almost\nthree decades before, and in it's graphic\nnovel form entered the Times best sellers\nlist, the first to do so. It was an modern,\nadult story in every sense of the word.\nDC immediately took steps to bring the\nregular Batman titles in line with Miller's vision. More and more titles from all\ncomic companies followed suit. With this\nmore modern, adult approach there was a demand for better writers and artists, and\nthe quality of the comics went up\naccordingly. People began to realise the\ntrue potential of the comic as an art\nform. Indeed, it has been hailed as the\nmedium of the future. Comics cross\nthe boundaries between traditional novels\nand the visual fields of cinema and art. It\nis possible to combine the visual impact\nof the latter with the depth of\ncharacter is ation and narrative techniques\nof the former. Artists such as Bill\nSienkiewicz have been at the forefront of\nthis work, in both regular series like\nMoon Knight, and graphic novels like\nElektra: Assassin.\nThis new wave has lead to a new\nemphasis in comics. The heroics have\nbecome secondary to the character is ation and relationships of the heroes. They are\nbecoming more human, more real, and\nless like two dimensional cardboard\ncutouts spouting inane comment at not\nvery threatening bad guys. Marvel\nComic'sX Men and related 'Mutant' titles\nhave dealt very well with this area.\nDetective's Green Arrow has spent two\nyears investigating he role of the victim\nin modern crime. The list continues to\ngrow.\nThe implications of this are finally\nbeginning to filter through to the public\nat large. The massive coverage of the\nBatman movie helped a great deal. Very\nsoon we may find ourselves living in a society that has realised that comics\naren't just for kids...\nNext Week: A review of the major\ncomic shops in London, and of the\nbest titles available at the moment...\n12 13\n\n"

    "content": "Hi Natural Selection St Mary's psychology department has sent\nout questionnaires to all applicants for St\nMary's Hospital Medical School and four\nother medical schools in the country.\nPress reports, originating from a recent\narticle in the Times Educational\nSupplement, implied that the completion\nof the questionnaire was in some way\nlinked to the success of an application.\nChris McManus, head of the research\ngroup which produced the questionnaires,\ndismissed the allegations, stating that\ncompletion of the questionnaire was\nentirely voluntary. He added that the\nonly applications received by medical\nschools were UCC A forms and that the\nlist of applicants were merely used to\ntarget the mail shot. No information\npassed between the medical school's application department and his research\ngroup, he said.\nConcerning privacy, Mr McManus said\nthat information gathered from the\nquestionnaire is entirely secure. The data\nresides on a computer that is not\nnetworked, and is separated from the\nmedical school.\nThe questionnaire is part of an ongoing\nproject to determine the attributes of a successful applicant, what makes a successful doctor and whether particular\ntypes of people choose particular career\npaths. The first questionnaire, sent out\nten years ago, was followed by further\ninformation gathering, including final\nresults and careers after medical school.\nAccording to Mr McManus one of the\naims of the project is to ensure that the\npublic is treated by the very best doctors.\nIf the character traits that lead to a student developing into a good doctor\ncan be ident if ii ed, and the information\nincorporated into the selection process,\nthis should result in the right candidates\nbeing selected. Mr McManus does not see\nthis as a discriminatory procedure but\nrather as part of a more refined selection\nprocess.\nHe said that previous work by his\nresearch team had shown that the\nranking policy employed by UCC A discriminated against some students.\nDepartments rejected applicants simply\nbecause of where their institution\nappeared on the list; Bristol university\nwas among the most blatant offender.\nUCC A have now since abolished the\nranking system.\nThe team's monitoring of applicants from\nethnic minorities revealed a significant\nlevel of disc rmi nation. UCC A has now set\nup its own monitoring scheme as a direct\nresult of the team's work.\nMr McManus felt that the work of his\nteam had been misrepresented in the\npress and has written a letter to one of\nthe newspapers concerned. Dr George\nTate, St. Mary's Admissions Tutor,\nconfirmed Mr McManus's statement,\nsaying that the only information St Mary's receive about applicants is that which is\nstated on the UCC A form.\nCCU Election Time!\nNext week sees the voting for both Royal\nCollege of Science and City and Guilds\nUnion non-sabbatical posts.\nThere are three candidates for the post\nof City and Guilds President; Tim Proctor,\nJohn Sears and Ajit Medtia. The following\nare standing for other posts: Steve\nFarrant and Lucia Clipstowe for VicePresident; Robert Evans and Niall Davies\nfor Honorary Secretary; Steven\nHolbrough and Mark Jackson for\nEntertainments Officer.\nMark Payne, Chris Browne, Sarah\nWelsh and James Shaw are all unopposed\nfor the posts of Academic Affairs Officer,\nOld Centralian's rep, Publicity Officer and\nGuild Sheet Editor respectively.\nIn the Royal College of Science\nelections Angela Creissen and Louise\nRafferty are standing for the post of\nPresident with Flemming Heino and\nRichard Murray and standing for the post\nof Vice-President. For the post of\nHonorary Junior Treasurer Robert\nLeamon and Richard Thaiss and both\nstanding with Simon Gibbons and Chris\nField the only candidates for the posts of\nHonorary Secretary and Academic Affairs\nOfficer respectively.\nThe hustings for the RCS candidates\nwere held in the Union Dining Hall on\nThursday with the elections being held on\nMonday next week. The elections for the\nCity and Guilds posts will be on Tuesday.\nCandidates for the Royal School of\nMines elections will not be known until\nnext week.\n2\n\n"

    "content": "The Story So Far...\nI'm back. Sorry; no clever little intro this\nweek. I can't think of one.\nThe End Last week Felix received a letter from a woman who had actually had an\nabortion. Out of respect for her and her\nfeelings, and those of any other person at\ncollege in a similar position, I am drawing\na close to the abortion debate. The\nopinion article written by IC Pro-Life Soc\nwas only printed this week as it had been\narranged before this letter was received.\nThe discussion has been raging for\nseveral weeks, and clearly it is a very\nemotive issue, about which people have\nvery strong personal feelings. It is also\ngoing nowhere. Both sides have had their\nsay many times over, and thus I feel that\nto continue would merely cause more\nunnecessary pain to people who have had\npersonal experiences with the subject.\nMeanwhile, back at the Batcave...\nAs I 've already stated, I'm back (bit\nobvious by now, really). The evil\nmasterminds of the Brotherhood of\nExaminers gave me their worst, and I lived to tell the tale, although my degree\nmay not have done. (Only joking, Mum. Honest). Thus you are once again the\nproud owner of a big, chunky, twenty\nfour pager. However, at this point I must\nsay a huge ' THANKYOU!' to the rest of\nthe Felix staff for single-handedly (well,\nthere are several of them, but you know what I mean...) producing the Valentine's issue last week, and more importantly for\nnot saying anything really horrible about\nme in their editorial. It's okay, you can\npoint the gun somewhere else now,\nguys...\nAs you may already know, next week\nis the (drum roll, trumpet fanfare...)\nTravel Special!!! Which means the whole\nof Felix is going to be jam-packed with\narticles written by people who have been\nto really nice hot places, and are very\nsmug about it. If you haven't yet\nsubmitted (ooo-er) an article, then it's not\ntoo late (well, not quite). The final\ndeadline is Monday, so get scribbling.\nNext issue is also the penultimate one\nbefore the Imperial College Union\nelections. As such it will contain mug shots of all the candidates for the various\nsabbatical positions (President, Deputy\nPresident, Hon Sec (Events), and of\ncourse, the most important one: Felix\nEditor). More importantly it will also\npresent their manifestoes.\nSo, if you're a candidate, bear this in\nmind: The deadline is Monday, 25th February, 12.30 pm sharp. All manifestoes must be 300 words or less. If\nthey are longer they will be cut at the\n300th word, even if in mid-sentence.\nSorry, but it's the only way to ensure that\nno one candidate gains an advantage\nover any other.\nIf you're not a candidate, then it's going\nto be your first chance to see who's who,\nso read carefully. The people you vote in\nwill be in charge of the Union for the\nnext year. Too many people here\ncomplain about the Union; that it doesn't do enough for us; it doesn't do the things\nyou want; you never know what's going\non; etc, etc. If you don't make the effort\nto find out about the candidates, you\nwon't know who you're voting for, and\nyou won't be able to vote for the right\nperson. Not voting at all is even worse.\nThis is the biggest chance we get to\nmake sure things are how we want them.\nThe Union is there for us, but if we don't make the effort and get involved then\nwe've no right to complain. Apathy never\nachieves anything, and neither does\nwinging when it's too late. Right, rant\nover. But make sure you VOTE! What will our heroes do next?\nWell, we've got a couple of new things\ncoming up (no, I'm not going to use the\nsame joke twice in on issue. Next week,\nthough...). The first is a regular diary\ncolumn, written by a student here, and\ndetailing his life in the previous week.\nI 've already seen a sample, which he\nswears is true. The easily shocked need\nnot read, but the names will be changed\nto protect the innocent (guilty?).\nNext comes the 'Boring Lecture Forum'.\nHave you ever been stuck in a boring\nlecture? Have you ever whiled away the\ntime by producing an exquisite work of\nliterature or art? Do bears do various\nnaughty things in the woods? Does the\nPope like the taste of concrete? If so\n(well, mainly if the second one...), then\nFelix wants you. Or rather, Felix wants\nyour creations, whatever they may be.\nThe only requirement is that it was\nproduced in a boring lecture. So go for it:\nShow the world that not all students are\ntime wasters! Drop your stuff off at the\nFelix office.\nAlso coming soon: A one off special set\nof interviews with the Sab candidates,\nasking them the kind of questions that\nthey don't want to be asked, but that you want to know the answers to. This will\nbe in the issue after next. AND a special\npost election round-up, in the issue after\nthat. Yes, you are going to VOTE, whether you like it or not...\nThe heroes triumphant (ie, the end!)\nWell, that's about it for now. With any\nluck the new cartoon will be regular (or a certain new cartoonist will be in trouble).\nYou'll all be glad (?) to know that\neveryone's(?) favourite cat will be back\nnext week, complete with high body-count (or a certain editor/cartoonist/part-time biologist/alien sex fiend will be in\ntrouble). And remember that the C&G and RCS C CU elections are on Monday.\nThink of them as a warm-up to the ICU\nones.

    "content": "ENVIRO\nChris Riley looks at industry's attitude to the environment\nProblems and Pollutions\nWith the world population spiralling\ntowards seven billion, it is unrealistic to\nrevert to the stone age technology called\nfor by some of the more radical 'anti-progress' pressure groups. ' We cannot\nlook solely to the use of the land and windmills to support us in the future'\nexplains Shell's public affairs officer, Mr Wyberry. 'Since the Second WorldWar there has been a five fold increase in\nconsumption of energy. This demand has\nbeen met primarily by oil, coal and gas.\nToday, the world( excluding the\ncommunist countries) consumes 53 million\nbarrels of oil a day. It is, however, only\nin the last five years that we have\nbecome aware of the corresponding\nincrease in C02 which has accompanied\nthe increase in use of fossil fuels.'\nShell sees the global warming and climatic changes as a challenge to be met\nby improvements in technology. Waste\nhandling, air quality...etc...can all be\nsolved by technology if we spend enough\nmoney', explains BP's public relations\nofficer, Mr Brown. 'However a technical\nsolution is not a solution unless it is\neconomically viable.'\n'Europe has set itself the task of\nbringing C02 levels down to 1988 levels\nby the year 2005. We must switch from\ncoal and oil to natural gas and ultimately\nto non-fossil fuels. 'For decades gas has\nbeen the Cinderella of the oil industry\u2014a useless by-product, not readily\ntransportable and instead, flared off from\noil rigs. But with increases in technology\nits importance is increasing. Gas turbine\ntechnology is 6 0 % more efficient than\nconventional turbines. Forty per cent of\nthe world's proven gas reserves come\nfrom the USSR and Siberia, Iran and the\nMiddle East. The potential to link the\nderelict Russian economy with an\nenvironmentally-conscious gas-hungry\nwest is enormous.'\n'It is on the fuel consumption side that\nthe potential for saving energy exists',\nargues Shell. 'The gas used by western\nEurope equals that lost by leaking pipes\nworldwide. Simply by replacing an old\nfridge with new equipment, the best that's available, 7 0 % improvements in energy\nefficiency can be achieved. Take a typical\npump: simply by choosing the right pump\nfor the right application energy efficiency\ncan be improved by 6 0 % ' .\nDespite these caring claims, when Shell\nwere approached about the Petromiser,\n(reported in Issue 891) they were not\ninterested. What it boils down to is that\ncuts in public consumption of energy\nmean cuts in business and profit for the\nmajor energy companies.\nShell are full of suggestions such as\n'biomass electricity generation', (growing\nof fuel in fields for gasification to fuel gas\nturbines), but when approached about\ntheir own alternative energy research\nthey have very little to boast about.\nEnergy companies should not be\nfighting to preserve and promote the\npresent levels of energy consumption, but\nto diversify into alternative energy\nsources\u2014to plan for the future. These socalled 'alternatives' will one day be our\nonly choice, when fossil fuels are no\nlonger an alternative.\nWhen questioned about their\ninvestments in the future their excuse is\nalways that long term predictions cannot\nbe made in the oil industry. Shell cannot\nsee far enough ahead to the point when\nthere is no more oil or, more importantly,\nwhen the consequences of burning more\noil are fatal. They argue that fifteen years\nago, the North Sea fields were only going\nto support us into the 1990s. Since then\nexploration has shown them to be\ncapable for fuelling us for the 'foreseeable\nThe simple incentive\nof saving the\nplanet is not enough.\nfuture'. The foreseeable future, like\ntomorrow, never comes.\nBP, whilst prepared to discuss\nimprovements in energy efficiency, are\nadamant that these goals are not pursued\nat the exclusion of exploration, their life\nblood. 'Continued exploration for\nexpendable fuels and the preservation of\nthe environment are not mutually\nexclusive goals'. Sadly though, as long as\nthere is still the temptation of fossil fuels\nto be extracted and utilised, it seems that\nthe 'alternatives' (renewable energy\nsources) will not be sought with any\nconviction. BP, like any commercial\nventure needs a financial incentive to\ndiversify. The simple incentive of saving\nthe planet is not enough. For now though, increasing production costs to\nclean up the industry does not make\nbusiness sense. Until the political impetus\nto change this is supplied, industry will\ncontinue to generate their big profits at\nthe expense of the environment.\nSpokesmen for both BP and Shell stress\nthat any environmental legislation must\nbe implemented on an international basis.\nEach country should have its own high\nenvironmental standards governed by\nlocal law but based on international\nconcepts. Whilst environmental policy in\nindustry is still very much a voluntary\naction, few companies are prepared to\nfollow BP's exemplary style. 'Many\ncompanies take advantage of the low\nsafety standards and non-existent\nenvironmental laws of the\nunderdeveloped countries to keep their\ncosts to a minimum and to maximise\ntheir profits. Without common generic\nstandards this will always happen, and\nthose companies who are first to make an\neffort to cut pollution will be punished\nfinancially. Consequently, no company is\nat present prepared to make the first\nmove, and although our hopes and aspiration for the future are different we\nare all tarred with the same 'dirty' brush.'\nBut who then is to pay for this mass\nclean-up of the industrial bad guys? BP is\nresolute that any cleaning up of industry\nshould be funded by the public in the\nform of taxes. 'The environment is for the\npublic good. Costs should be shared by all\nbeneficiaries\u2014a fair share of the costs is\nvital.' Passing the cost to the customer in\nthis way is all very well in the first world\nbut it seems that such methods are not\napplicable to a third world country that\ncannot even afford to feed its own population.\nEven within the 'black triangle' of\neastern Europe, where Greenpeace\nworkers are perceived as 'rich kids with\nnothing better to do', care for the\nenvironment is considered an expensive\nluxury. 'Perhaps it is ' argues Peter\nTickle, eastern block consultant to\nGreenpeace. 'Greenpeace have been\naccused of depriving seal hunters of a way of life. The fossil-fuel-free future that\nwe fight for is ultimately suffocating\nmining communities. However if you consider the long term costs of chronic\nair pollution to public health, it seems\nsensible to stop the pollution before it\nhappens. In Czechoslovakia some four\nmillion people live in the most heavily\nLeaving a window\nopen at night results\nin throbbing\nheadaches...\ncontaminated areas. During the winter,\nwhen continuous smog conditions prevail\nfor weeks, children are forbidden to\nindulge in strenuous activity. Leaving a window open at night results in throbbing\nheadaches the next day. In Bratislava, the\ncapital of Slovakia, air pollution has\ndegraded the physical landscape and the\nhuman environment to the point where\nthe suicide rate is the highest in Europe.'\nBP may be more prepared than most\nfor tougher environmental legislation\nwhich it calls for, but it will require more\ncommercial evolution than just a change\nof logo to survive into the 21st Century.\nIronically those who will dictate and\nimplement any future environmental law\nare also the guardian angels of industry.\nIt is in their own interests to nurture such\ncompanies pruning them annually for\ntheir taxes. The question is will this\nsymbiosis finally suffocate the animals?\n14\n\n"

First; tribalism. In many African\nstates white domination of blacks has\nbeen replaced with maybe one tribe\ndominating all the others. In South Africa\nwe have the communist ANC and the\ntribal Inkatha movement. Because of\nworld arms embargoes, South Africa now\nhas a huge weapons industry. I do not\nthink that either group is sophisticated\nenough to handle the responsibility yet.\nAt the same time I do not think this\nshould be used to perpetuate Apartheid.\nAnyone got an opinion?\n4. Mascotry. This is a proud tradition. It\nenabled about eight guys on each team to\nplay soldier and use warlike talkies,\ndirecting youthful fresher s in defence of\ntheir mascot. It allows ten people to pile\ninto the back of a Hertz van and drive at\nsilly speeds around London. The Unions\nhave squads of cars and motor bikes to\npursue the vans.\nVery soon a van will pull out of College\nat high speed and hit a child, a car,\nmaybe just a lamp-post. The drivers are\ngood, but there's no accounting for the\nother idiots on the road. There is going\nto be a witness who reports ten people\nrunning from the back carrying a metallic\nobject. The hire company will piece\ntogether that a) ten people is illegal and\nb) the van was being used for mascot ry. They are highly likely to say that the\ninsurance is therefore invalid, and the\nUnion is legally responsible for the repair\nof the van (thousands), and personal\ndamages to the victim, which can come\nto millions.\nToilet Talk\nDear Andy,\nI'm not quite sure how it is that a small\nminority of people are allowed to graf it ti and destroy the Union Building toilets but\nthey have. Today I went to the bog by\nthe bar for a good dump and find no\ntoilet seat or functioning door lock. I then\ncrossed to the one by the lobby at the\nfoot of the stairs and found no bog paper\nand the walls covered in graf it ti. Maybe\nI'm overly sensitive but I think that\ninstead of \u00a34K to a management\nconsultant, perhaps \u00a32K refurbishment\nand maintenance of the heads should be\na good idea?\nA man with a real anus.\nP.S. At least the toilets were clean, last\ntime I went I found a lake of ch under in\none and a still vomiting member of Beans\nClub in the other, unconscious.\nThis is not even a worst case scenario.\nLots of schools crocodile children around\nthe area. It will happen sometime. It will\nbe a rare event, but when it happens for\nthe first time there is going to be severe\nhell to pay.\nThis is something I think people should\nbe concerned about. The mascots are\nhardly ever seen, kept in secret locations\nby the chosen few. They hardly ever\nraise money for charity as they are rarely\nstolen. Mines doesn't appear to care one\nway or the other (at least they don't risk\nlives).\nI have an idea for an alternative:\nThe mascots must be stored somewhere\non College grounds. They must be\nbrought to all UG Ms and any Union\nevent.\nI think this will have the following\neffects:\n1. The mascots will have a much higher\nprofile, creating support and reducing\napathy.\n2. They will get stolen a lot more often,\ngenerating even more patriotism and\nloads of money.\n3. There is no chance of hitting\nsomeone with a van.\n4. The top secret mascot ry teams might\ncomplain that they'll have no fun. (Well\nnot publicly, but they'll oppose my plan\nfor that reason.) I would say to them that\nthe challenge of getting it across College\nonce a week or so will be much more\nsatisfying.\nAthena.\nNend-a Bike\nFulham, London SW6 ITD\n071-371 5867\n\n"

New members always welcome.\nBogged - down Lane\nDear Andy,\nIn reply to the small piece headed 'Real\nFunding', there were so many points\nraised in the article it is difficult to know where to start. It is far too easy to blame\nindividuals up to and including sabbaticals\nfor the state of the Union now (mind you,\nCouncil approved expenditure for\nsurveying 2,000 students according to the\nPresident's report request, but at the U GM he claimed it was for 1,200-1,500\nstudents, an increased cost of 25-40%.\nAnd he reckons I'm trying to mislead\nCouncil!?!? Couldn't resist that one Shan).\nBut on closer reflection the blame can't lie there. Elected individuals are endorsed\nto try and put in their own ideas and\nfeelings for what is best for the students,\nwhilst enacting their will as well from\nUGMs etc. The failure of these are not an\nindication of the weakness of any\nproposals, but the inappropriateness of\ntheir conception in the current climate.\nHowever, in the light of new proposals\nto abolish the UG M,I feel the first place\nto start is with the committee structure.\nPresently, the U GM is the sovereign body\nof ICU, followed by Council, then UFC is\nbeneath Council. Now UFC is supposed to\ngive advice and investigate the finances\nof the Union. So, it would be obvious that\nUFC should report to Council. BUT, a few\nyears ago Council thought that it was\ndoing too much work, and since the\nmajority of UFC seemed to be a sensible\ncommittee, so why abolish it. Hence, all\nUnion financial matters are decided by\nUFC, then theoretically rubber-stamped\nby Council, though now matters don't seem to get that far, they are just\naccepted.\nSo that's the current situation now, but\nit seems that the decisions of the Union's past are now catching up with us in a big\nway. If UGMs are to go then Council will\nhave to take more responsibility. Is that\nlikely to happen. Well, from Mr Eyers\nreckoning, only a few people bother to\ntake part in important discussions. Thanks\nfor that, I'm sorry if people are thinking\nthat I'm not saying enough, but I'm not\nsure what's going on half the time. I can\nonly presume that their education here is\nsecond to none and that they understand\nperfectly what's going on. I doubt that,\nbut the more accurate answer would be\nthat people are not bold enough to ask\nquestions. And who can blame them? I 've\nbeen here nearly four years and never\nfor one moment felt 100% comfortable\nabout what's going on!\nYour editorial said 'the only way things\ncan get any better is if you get involved'.\nA more accurate perception would have\nbeen '...if you get INVOICED!'\nYours,\nAwfully bogged-down,\nSpenser Lane, SCC Chairman.\nUnited?\nDear Andy,\nI wonder what the Children of the\nWinnie Mandela Centre for the Under\nFives, think about her recent appearance\nin court on the charges of assault and\nabduction. The allegations involve the\nfeared Mandela Utd football team which\nshe 'managed' whilst her husband was\nenjoying prison life. The captain of this\nfootball club has already been found\nguilty of the murder or poor little\nStompie.\nThis centre for the under fives is not, as\nyou would imagine in a shanty town of\nSoweto, but in the London Borough of\nIslington. I was wondering what a conversation between a pupil and teacher\nmight be like at this centre: 'Well, Johnny\ndon't drop that paint pot again or I 'll rip\nyour throat out with a pair of garden\nshears. Don't even think about telling\nyour parents or we'll go round your\nhouse, set fire to it, and gang rape your\nsister.'\nThis would be consistent with the\nMandela Utd code of practice. They have\nbeen responsible for the fear that has\nswept many black townships. This is\nshown by the reluctance of prosecution\nwitnesses to come forward to testify\nagainst the 'manager'. I must admit I have very little respect for either Mrs\nMandela or her terrorist husband,\nparticularly since her now famous\nquotation 'With our matches and our\nnecklaces we will liberate this land.'\nIsn't it sad that whilst President De\nKlerk is doing wonderful work with his\nreforms in the Republic of South Africa,\nthe main news that's coming out of this\ncountry is the trial of a wicked woman?\nIslington council should immediately rename the centre. Perhaps after some\ngreat British hero. How about the\nMargaret Thatcher centre for the Under\nFives or even after Norman Tebbit or\nEnoch Powell. However knowing\nIslington Council as I do, they'd probably\nname it after Saddam Hussein!\nYours,\nAlan Bailey.\nP.S.I have accepted your challenge of a public debate. You've got my number so\nwhen will you let me know the details?\n\n"

    "content": "Killing Joke\u2014the rock of legend and\nmusic of insanity. As they continued their\nconquest of uncompromising\ndetermination and gut ideology , The\nAstoria was expectant at the dawn of a new war against itself. Terror through\nanticipation ebbed and rose in the hard-cutting newsreel quotes, cut from the last\nfew days of turmoil in the Gulf \u2014 another\nSCUD missile attack on Riyadh, more\nthreats of chemical retaliation, pain,\ndistrust and anguish. Then came the\nhorror of American meat advertising. The\nshear flippancy of the greed after the\nstarvation just heard was pure irony.\nThrough this backdrop \u2014 our world\ntoday \u2014 arise Killing Joke to shock us\nbrutally from our satisfied apathy.\nKilling Joke are a legacy, a constant\nreminder of what we should be. Only\nthey could incite a riot, start massacres\nbut instead they rip at hearts with their\npounding chants. Their music is bare\nrhythm and beauty. They played and the\nearth changed. Now returned from\ndiversification with bands such as\nMinistry, they have returned with new\nsounds, founded by vocalist Jaz Coleman,\nGuitarist Geordie, drummer Martin Atkins\nYabby You\nand rejoined by their original bassist Paul\nRaven. God, these men should be\nimmortalised.\nKilling Joke made us care. The\nonslaught began with the single Money Is\nNot Our God and regressed via classic\nanthems Wardance, Empire Song and\nRequiem. They proved that their original\ninsights and ideals are still true, and that\ntheir original visions are all the more\nvalid now. The Astoria lept and punched\ntriumph at the roofs. All the while, the\nvisions of hardship, dep rav ation and\nhorror complemented the charged-up\npurity flung at us. Rock music has\nbecome the only way of reaching the\nears of such a self-centred society, by\nkicking and biting its way out from inside\ntheir very bodies.\nThe final conquest came in the final\nencore. Exhausted onlookers were\ndragged back to the eerily obsessive Love\nLike Blood, dedicated to 'all those who\nare going to die in the Gulf.' As the lines\n'As we move towards no end we learn to\ndie, Red tears are shed on grey'\nresounded, my heart bled. These men\ndemand to be listened to.\nSJH\n\u2014Beware Dub\nSo you've never heard of Yabby You? To\nbe honest niet her had we, but stick with\nus as we take you (with enthusiastic\nabandon) deep into the heart of, err, dub\nreggae.\nYabby has ben around for quite a while\nand has done most of his recording in the\nlate seventies. This album was actually\nrecorded in 78/79 and has been\nre released due to it being 'a much sought after collectors item ever since it's release'. He does more or less everything\nEast Village\n\u2014Circles 12\"\nEast Village have been around for about\ntwo years and have released a few\nsingles on Sub Aqua, as well as\nsupporting House of Love. They are now signed to the Heavenly label, home to the\nManic Street Preachers (and\num....Flowered Up). A fairly typical indie\nguitar band\u2014they sound similar to early\nPrimal Scream, but unlike Bobby and Co\nthey have so far shunned any dance\ninfluences. In fact the similarities don't stop there\u2014have a look at the blok e on\nthe right of the cover\u2014does he remind\nyou of anyone? Their latest offering\nCircles is mellow, but monotonous\u2014a tune waiting for a song to happen. The Bside Here it Comes is much more lively,\nbut would score no points for originality.\nOther bands have been here before, only\nthey have done it much better.\nEgor, Hedgehog and the Bastard\nAllsort.\nbar play on his album (which sounds kind\nof strange but he is credited with\ncomposing, producing and some of the\nsinging on Beware Dub.\nDeep, even bass underpins all the songs\nand a' just add water' ry th m guitar\ngives each track the usual reggae sound.\nIt's a very spacey album and we think it\nwould be improved if you listened to it\nwhilst being stoned, otherwise forget it.\nDebaser and Pop Kid\n11\n\n"

    "content": "Miller's Crossing\nThis is a film by Joel and Ethan\nCoen (Raising Arizona and Blood\nSimple) so you are probably entitled\nto expect something very good indeed.\nThis time the Coens have gone for the\nmob/mafia film, borrowing heavily from\n(or playing homage to?) the genre, as\nthey did in Blood Simple.\nThe conscience of the film is the\nprincipal character, Tom( Gabriel Byrne).\nTom is the brains behind the muscle of\nLeo (played by a slightly uncomfortable\nAlbert Finney), the local boss.\nUnfortunately Tom and Leo fall for the\nsame dame, Verna. Tom then leaves\nLeo's 'establishment' and joins up with a rival, Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito laps up\nthe role of the deranged ape, Johnny). A gang war follows.\nThe Coen's have tried to create the\nkind of modern tragedy that has become\nfashionable in Hollywood\u2014prime\nexamples being Coppola's Godfather films\nor Scorcese's Raging Bull. Tim is the man\nbehind the man, he's the guy with all the\n'angles'. But where's his conscience? This\nis the question the film tries to answer\nbut never really comes to terms with.\nTher's a lot of action, too much plot and\nnot nearly enough reflection\u2014although\nthere are moments of insight\u2014the scenes\nat Miller's Crossing (a majestic forest on\nthe edges of the city where the hoodlums\ngun down their victims), for example, are\nindescribably beautiful.\nThe cinematographer is also from the\ntwo previous Coen films, Barry\nSonnenfield. Raising Arizona would not\nhave been half as funny were it not for\nthe highly original and rather crazy\ncamera work. In Miller's Crossing,\nhowever, Sonenfield hasn't quite\nproduced the same kind of authenticity,\nbut nevertheless the quality of the picture\nhas the moody, dark feel which works\nwell with the film.\nI.H. \u2014 Film \u2014Comic/Plug\n\u2014 Opera The Field\nThis is a film, not surprisingly,\nabout a field. It's a lovely field, all\ngreen and lush, and a delight for all\nthe cattle that graze thereon. Its\nprosperity is due to the toil of Bull\nMcCabe (Richard Harris) and his son\nTadgh (Sean Bean) who gather seaweed\nand carry it a fair distance to add 12\nvitamins and minerals to their impressive\nturf. All the village know that the field is\nthe Bull's, due to his love and labour,\neven though it is owned by the young\nwidow (Frances Tomelty) from whom he\nrents it, so when the widow puts the field\nup for auction no-one will bid against\nhim. Cue the American (Tom Platoon\nBeringer) , who has come to Ireland to\nfind his roots, who has piles (Oh No!) of\ncash (Phew!) and outbids the Bull. This is\nthe crux that causes much trouble to the\nBull, who has a right to the field, by the\nlaw of the land, but no legal claim. The\nbad feelings get worse and things get\nvery out of hand with McCabe's fight for\nthe field threatening to lose him his son,\nwife, freedom and sanity.\nIt is a captivating story of Irish life in\nthe 1930's and all the characters are true\nindividuals. John Hurt's simple Bird\nO 'Donnel (no chest burst ers here) giggles a lot, grins near toothless ly, causes much mischief and carries a lamb, given half a chance. Richard Harris is excellent in his\nfirst film role for 10 years, giving us a proud man who lived for the land and is\nstill torn from his first son's death in the\nfamine. Beringer, just known as 'the\nAmerican', emphasises the difference\nbetween the community and the outside\nand shows us a future that could destroy\nthis way of life.\nThis is the second film by Jim Sheridan:\nthe director of My Left Foot. It is\nbeautifully shot and at times is\nreminiscent of Pertwee's Die Kroppe. The\nportrayal of a slower life and village\nhappenings is captured in full, with the\npetty squabbles, small romances and\ndonkey murder, better than any current\nsoap (save Lifebuoy). It's Big, it's clever\nand it's got a good beat! Go and see it\nbecause it's smashing.\nThe Amazing Machine (Sans Gerbil)\nComic Relief Comic From those lovable rogues who\nbrought you th os bulbous post\noffice red olfactory enhancers\ncomes a comic from the hearts, minds\nand loins of the best writers and artists,\nthat this misunderstood little piece of life\ncan offer. It's a tale of joys, woes and\nheartaches. Lenny Henry, Johathan Ross\nand Griff Rhys-Jones collect money little\nknowing that Griff has been replaced by\na house-head double and that if only one\nperson fails to donate to Comic Relief\nthen the house heads will take over the\nworld. To add to the dilemma a present-day Blackadder must be convinced into\ndonating by being shown all the places\nComic Relief money goes to work. Extra\nside plots turn up with giant Ben Elton\nand Dawn French slogging it out over\nLondon, The Turtles' approach to Red\nNose Day and the inclusion of virtually\nevery major comic hero (including Dennis\nthe Menace (and Wolverine\u2014Pendragon)\n(and Batman\u2014ASF)).\nThe selection of artists and writers is\nincredible with new people working on\njust about every page (great mix of\nstyles). It's a unique team up of Marvel,\nDC, IPC and numerous independents.\nWhich hero has the biggest chin? What\nare the Viz characters up to on Red Nose\nDay? It's great fun and at times simply\nexcellent. It's only SI.50 and all the\nmoney goes to Comic Relief. If you're\ninto comics then it's a must. If not, buy it\nanyway.\nThe Amazing Machine.\n\n"

    "content": "Russia House\nThe name's Blair, Barley Blair.\nSomehow, it doesn't have quite the\nsame ring about it, does it? Sean\nConnery's return to the spy game is a long way from his outings as the world's most famous secret agent, and 007's glamorous world is a far cry from this\nmuch more realistic portrayal of\nEast/West espionage.\nRussia House, is a slow, cerebral\nthriller, set in the heady day of the\nintroduction of Glasnost. The west\nremains jubilant, the Russians, cynical.\nThey spy masters? The want the good old\ndays of the Cold War back. When a beautiful Russian literary agent (the\nbeautiful, if not Russian, Michelle Pfeiffer)\noffers drunken Scots publisher (Connery,\nwho is, without doubt, Scots) a book\nwhich reveals that the Russians are well\nbehind in the Arms race, they are\npositively drooling over the possibilities\nthat open up.\nThis film is very much a product of\nGlasnost, both in it being the result of the\nauthor's first trip to Moscow, and in being\nthe first film to be allowed to shoot freely\nin the USSR. The attitude is very post\nGlasnost too. There are no real 'goodies'\nor 'baddies', instead several different\nshades of grey. Even the most principled\nRusalka I Rusalka is the water nymph who falls in love with a human prince\nand begs the witch Jezibaba\nto transform her into a woman. She pays\nthe terrible price of losing the power of\nspeech and, when she is rejected by her\nlover, is estranged from both the human\nand spirit world.\nKvapil's text is inspired by myths as\ndiverse as Anderson's The Little Mermaid,\nCzech poet Erben's ballad about The\nWater Spirit and Fouque's tale of Undine,\nbut is suffused by Czech folk beliefs in\nwhich there is no good or evil, but where\nman, alienated from nature, is corrupt.\nDvorak's setting is Wagnerian in scale\nand construction, but displays his talent\nfor lyrical melody and rich orchestration.\nIt also evinces bravery in composing for a heroine who is dumb for much of the\nsecond act.\nMusically, this is an excellent\nproduction. Nancy Gustavson as Rusalka\nhas both the strength and subtlety to\nhandle the lead role; Norman Bailey as\nthe Water Spirit has grav it as and conveys\nan old man's forebodings of youth's unwise choices; Felicity Palmer's Jezibaba\nis a malevolent delight, crisp and\npowerfully sung.\nThe set is also marvellous, contributing\nto the magical aura of the production.\nWhite boards slide back to reveal a cool\nblue pool in the centre of an almost\ncharacters are forced to sell out in the\nend, to preserve themselves. If anyone\nemerges in a truly negative light, it is the\nAmericans, who ride roughshod over the\nBritish, desperately trying to restart the\ncold war, to facilitate greater arms\ncontracts for American companies.\nAnd so, this broad tale develops against\nthe glorious, if surprisingly alien,\nbackdrop of the major Russian cities,\nbeautifully fitted to the cinema scope in\nwhich it is filmed. The performances are\nall nicely measured, excepting Ken Russell's( better known as a director)\nbizarre appearance as an expert on\nRussia, about which I have certain\nreservations. Otherwise, this is an\nextremely acceptable espionage movie,\nthe best I 've seen in a while.\nPendragon\nentirely white set; a mirror reflects the\nstriking deep blue back cloth which depicts the sky; Rusalka sits on a swing\nsuspended mid-stage. In the second act,\nthe palace is represented by a glass room\nwhich revolves around Rusalka as she sits\nsuspended on the swing; later she scuttles\naround its glass walls like a trapped\nspider. In the third act we return to the\npool which is now darkened, the mirror\nis smashed and a bloated moon hangs\nagainst the inky night.\nIt is sad that the acting is not up to the\nrest of the performance. The portrayal of\nthe palace staff as spineless, mindless rag\ndolls shows some inspiration in the\ndirection, but mostly the cast alternate\nbetween melodramatic hamming and\naimless activity.\nOverall, a production to see, if only for\nthe orchestral playing which I would\nhappily have sat through as a concert\nperformance. However, it is sad that the\nsexual messages of the legend and the\nopera, exemplified by Rusalka's dumbness, were skated over and never\nproperly addressed.\nLiz W6 "

    "content": "The Slow Moving Snail invites you to celebrate words.\nBooks for Living\nIn all the debate about literacy and our\nschools one small blue document, costing\nonly \u00a32.50, was overlooked. This is sad as\nit examines the very heart of the issue. It\nis also heavily ironic, as it is,\nunbelievably, the product of Her Majesty's Inspectorate from the Department of\nEducation and Science. It is a delightful\nbook that aims to persuade teachers that\n'poetry matters and that its teaching\nshould not be relegated to the end of the\nday, the week, or the term'. Why review\nit here, you may be thinking. Because\nTeaching Poetry in the Secondary School\nnot only answers the question why we\ndon't read poetry after school, it actually\ninspires a desire to start reading it!\nWords\nThe arguments are nearly poetic in\ntheir clarity and enthusiasm. In looking\nfor quotes I wanted to reprint the whole\nbooklet. As perpetual students of life all\nof us should have a copy. More\nimportantly we should ensure that all\nparents and English teachers buy it. Here\nis a small taste of the excitement of the\nbook:\n'Poetry matters because it is a central\nexample of the use human beings make\nof words to explore and understand. Like\nother forms of writing we value, it lends\nshape and meaning to our experiences\nand helps us to move with confidence in\nthe world we know and then step beyond\nit, to respond to the generation of\nmeaning through significant, memorable\nand deliberate kinds of language. It is an\nactivity to which we are drawn because\nin its range and rig our we feel both the\npresence and the pressure of human\nexperience. Poetry embodies delight in\nexpression, stretched between thought,\nfeeling and form. As we become aware of\nthe 'true soundings' of poetry so we\nbecome aware of what we ourselves\nmight do with language.'\nAs George Orwell illustrates in the\nnewspeak of 1984, it is language that\ngives us the power for our thoughts,\nextend language and you widen the\nhorizon of our ideas and freedoms. This\nbooklet is front-line ammunition in the\nstruggle against the forces of ignorance\nand bigotry that feed Big Brother. It is a small step in promoting our species' sense\nof humanity.\nA celebration of these steps, told\nthrough the history of human knowledge\nand science, has recently been republished in paperback by the BBC. As part of their new Classics Series they\nhave brought out Jacob Bronowski's book\nAscent of Man. If you have lost your\nprimary school inquisitiveness and\ncreativity, your sense of wonder at\nhuman knowledge because of the soulless\nnature of the secondary school and\ncollege curriculum; if learning has now\nbecome solely work to achieve a degree\nand job - then you need this book. It will\ninfect you with Bronowski's personal\nenthusiasm and optimism. It will\nchallenge you with science that has a human soul.\nBronowski is one of those scientists,\npoets, playwrights, historians and\nphilosophers who celebrates the values\nand unity found in science and art. As he\nexpresses in a second book, Science and\nHuman Values, that should be reprinted\nand sent to all undergraduates before\nthey start here - it might lessen the\ninhumanity of this place:\n'In science and in art and in self-knowledge we explore and move\nconstantly by turning to the world of\nsense to ask, is this so? This is the habit\nof truth, always minute yet always\nurgent, which for four hundred years has\nentered every action of ours; and has\nmade our society and the value it sets on\nman, as surely as it had made the\nlinotype machine and the scout knife, and\nKing Lear and the Origin of the Species\nand Leonardo's Lady with a Stoat.'\nGlorious\nMiroslav Holub, the Czech poet and\nscientist, when he spoke here in\nNovember about Science, Art and Ethics\nquoted Bronowski. There is no better\nway of expressing such thoughts.\nHolub expresses in his poetry ways of\nseeing the world through the turbulence\nof a society suppressed by Stalinism, in\nwhich truth is corrupted into power. The\npoems explore meanings with a sense\nthat they give us the world, and yet,\nthere is the cutting edge of the final lines\nthat tell of loss. Are facts real? Do they\nrelate to why? How can we know something in a society in which a fact is\na fact through fear? This fear and sadness\ngives Holub's work a vitality and\nsignificance. Here is the pen as sword,\nscience as liberator.\nHolub is a poet published by Bloodaxe\nBooks, a company set-up due to the\nanger of Neil Astley at the insult poetry\nwas given by commercial publishers. He\nhas published a compilation of the works\nof 56 poets, writers who have been\nencouraged and supported in their work\nby Bloodaxe. Poetry With an Edge is an\nintroduction to contemporary poetry for\nthose of us who don't know where to\nbegin. Holub is there, as is Jo Shapcott.\nHer book Electroplating the Baby is a, series of personal images, funny,\nromantic, everyday, macabre, with an\nunderlying sense of discovery. Her\ninspiration comes from a range of objects\nand events, as varied as a book stand in a railway station to articles in Victorian\nscience magazines to a mug.\nOn Valentines Day Jo aroused her\naudience with sex and science, the\nexploration of atomic particles became an\nerotic massage of her body. Using weird\ncharacters such as Tom the Cat, Marilyn\nMonroe and a cow with BSE, she turned\nher audience into anarchic word destroyers, body language physicists and\nscientists with an insane stare and aten dancy for the shakes. The Haldane\nLibrary vibrated with words.\nTwo professional psychologists got\ntogether to publish a collection of\nquotations called In a Dark Time. This is\nconstructed into a thought journey from\nshock to depression to the joy of hope, as\nit travels through the insanity of war. If\nyou are depressed by the in human bigotry expressed in the present gung-ho\nattitude to the Gulf war this book will\nturn your depression into tears of hope,\nfor 'In a dark time the eye begins to see'.\nAll the books reviewed here express\nthe vital human need to read. By turning\ntheir pages, turning their words into our\nimages and concepts, we are expressing\nand expanding our humanity. Sadly being\nhuman, apart from recognition for\ncommunication, avoidance or sex, is not\na valued or well understood concept at\nImperial. There are a few places here\nthat do represent hope of higher things;\nthe Haldane Library - sadly not the\nHumanities Department - and most\nimportantly, in the Physics Department\nthere is the Blackett Bookshop, just\nopposite the general office on level 3,\nopen every lunchtime from 12:30 to 2:30.\nWords\nHere you can buy second-hand books\nthat smell like human thought and\nimagination.\nLong may the human spirit struggle to\nsurvive here and eventually tear down\nthe present monstrosity that sacrifices\nscience to the politics of financial\nmanagement, utility and marketing.\nAll the Bloodaxe Books mentioned can be\nbought from the Union Bookstore. Ascent\nof Man from Dillons in the Science\nMuseum. Teaching Poetry in the\nSecondary School can be ordered from\nHM SO tel: 622 3316. In a Dark Time\nedited by Nicolas Humphrey and Robert\nJay Lifton is published by Faber and\nFaber and can be ordered from any good\nbookshop.\n15\n\n"

    "content": "OPINION\nIC ProLife Society give their viewpoint on the current letters page debate\n'Did I Kick Too\nThe Status Quo\nIn 1967, David Steel's Abortion Act made\nabortion a reality in Great Britain,\nostensibly for 'hard' cases, ie rape,\nhandicap, danger to the health of the\nmother. But such was the wording of the\nact that in practice, by extending the\nmeaning of 'medical reason' to include\nemotional distress or inconvenience, it -could be interpreted as allowing abortion\non demand. Of the 183,000-plus abortions\ncarried out in Britain in 1989, fewer than\n10% were for 'hard' cases, yet it is by\nciting this small minority of cases that\nmost of those who support abortion\nattempt to justify the remainder. The\nrecent letter in FELIX from Athena was a typical example of using circumstances\ninvolving perhaps a few hundred cases to\njustify the remaining hundreds of\nthousands of cases. It is important to\nrealise that the vast majority of abortions\nare for far less grave reasons, such as\ncareer disruption, financial difficulty and\nWhy Pro-Life?\nThe difference between those who are\npro-life and those who are pro-abortion,\nand the reason for all the antagonism\nbetween them, is that their reasoning\nstems from entirely different bases. Prolifers are not unaware of the arguments\nfor abortion. They realise that great\ndifficulty is often faced by the mother,\nand that the child may not always be\nbrought up in ideal surroundings but they\nbelieve that the right of every human\nbeing to life is paramount, and that in no\ncase can the prospect of hardship for one\nperson justify the denial of life to another.\nHowever, the same concern for human life that prompts these beliefs means that\nmost pro-lifers would not wish simply to\nban abortion, but also to change the\ncircumstances in which the decision is\nmade to favour the pro-life option. If, for\nexample, adoption had enjoyed the same\ngood publicity afforded to- abortion, and\nDSS provision for the family was\nimproved, abortion might seem less\nappealing.\nThree areas of particular concern at the\nmoment are Post Abortion Syndrome, the\nRU486 'abortion pill', and abortion and\nthe handicapped.\nPost Abortion Syndrome\nIt is unsurprising that women often feel\nemotionally disturbed as a result of an\nabortion, but in recent years evidence has\nbeen increasing that would suggest that\nthe magnitude of the trauma is far\ngreater than is commonly recognised.\nMany women, perhaps years after having\nan abortion, experience feelings of guilt\nand regret of such a degree that their\nmental health is threatened.\nThe medical establishment has yet to\nrecognise what is becoming known as\nPost Abortion Syndrome, and the health\nservice and abortion agencies offer little\nhelp to the women to whom they so\nreadily provide abortions. These women\nare, after the unborn child, the second\nvictims of abortion. They deserve no\nresentment for having been pushed by\ncircumstances into having an abortion,\nbut only help and understanding in\ncoming to terms with what they have\nbeen through. It is with the support of\nthe major pro-life organisations that\ngroups have been rapidly expanding that\noffer help and counselling to such\nwomen, often run by women who have\nexperienced abortion themselves.\nRU486 The RU486 'Abortion Pill', already in use\nin France, is heading for Britain. Medical\ntrials have begun, and a license has been\napplied for.\nThere are many worrying points\nassociated with RU486, and even many of\nthose who support abortion in general\nwill have cause for concern.\nThe motivation behind the speed with\nwhich the French, and soon our\ngovernment have licensed the drug may\nA Woman's Right?\n'A Woman's Right to Choose'\nThis is a phrase which never fails to\ncome up in any abortion debate. One\nthing the pro-abortion lobby have been\nmost successful in over the past years is\nto make it a feminist issue.\nWell, speaking as a woman, I'm all for\nsexual equality. My rights to equal\neducation and career opportunities are\nthings I feel very strongly about; but Iam also pro-life. This is not a contradiction\u2014I just don't see this 'right to choose' as a right at all.\nIn the first place, abortion is not a legal\nright. The 1967 Abortion Act removed\nthe criminal penalties for performing\nabortions in certain circumstances. It\nconferred no rights on anyone.\nSecondly, this choice ultimately comes\ndown to whether the unborn child in the\nwomb lives or dies. For all my feminist\nbeliefs, I don't accord myself absolute\npower over the life and death of anyone.\n'A woman has the right to do what she\nlikes with her own body.'\nAbsolutely true, but is the foetus really\njust part of the mother's body? I have not\nyet heard a convincing argument against\nlife beginning at conception.\nThe Warnock Committee stated in their\nreport that, '...once the process has\nbegun, there is no particular part of the\ndevelopment process that is more\nimportant than another. All are part of a continuous process...'\nThere is no point at which the 'blob of\ncells' in a woman's uterus suddenly\nbecomes a human being. This event took\nplace at the beginning, when the sperm\nimpregnated the egg to give the full\ngenetic complement of the new\nindividual. The unborn child is genetically\ndistinct from both parents. Far from being\nanother part of its mother's body, it is a different, distinct human being. If it were\njust the woman's body involved, then the\n'her body and her choice' argument\nmight hold up, but there are two bodies\ninvolved, and in dealing with one it is\nsurely not acceptable to destroy the\nother.\nAll this having been said, the immense\ndifficulties raised when faced with an\nunplanned pregnancy can of course seem\noverwhelming. Whatever a woman may\nhave believed before, the shock of finding\nherself pregnant may cause her to\nconsider an abortion. The disruption of\nher studies, her career, the stigma of\nillegitimacy, the problems of being a single parent, and the worst thing\npossible, pregnancy as a result of rape,\nare pressures that must not be\nunderestimated.\nHowever, the central fact remains. The\nchild is a human being. No matter how it\ncame into being, it is there, and has the\nsame right to life as anyone else.\nAll too often, the only real option\noffered to a woman in an unplanned\npregnancy is abortion. Other avenues are\nsimply not explored. The child is assumed\nto be a burden that the mother wishes to\ndispose of as soon as possible. An abortion is offered, carried out, and the\nwoman is then left to carry on with her\nlife as though nothing had happened. This\nis simply not acceptable. All the possible\nalternatives must be considered.\nPregnancy need not mean the end of life\nas we know it. A great fear is that a girl's parents will reject her if they find she is\npregnant. Although this is regrettably true\nin some cases, many will, after the initial\nshock, offer the support that the mother\nneeds\u2014it is after all their grandchild.\nEven when the mother is disowned, there\nis substantial support available from other\nsources. Pro-life groups such as LIFE offer\nboth counselling and practical help,\nincluding help with claiming DHSS grants,\nguidance on employment protection and\nmaternity payments, baby clothing and\nequipment, and accommodation both\nbefore and after the birth.\nPregnancy is a wholly natural\noccur e nce.A woman's whole lifestyle\nneed n't be changed because she is\nabout abortion\nHard?'\nnot be entirely honourable. Just as\ngovernments are keen on abortion as a means of relieving pressure on\nunderfunded health and social services,\nthey are keen on RU486 because it is an\noutpatient method of abortion, lowering\ndemand for beds. RU486 has been\npromoted as a leap forward in women's rights, with the image of swallowing the\npill and 'solving the problem'. The reality\nis less appealing. At least three\nappointments are required over a period\nof around ten days, to administer the\ndrug and kill the embryo, then to\nOPINION\nadminister prostaglandin to expel the\nembryo, and finally to check abortion is\ncomplete. Severe pain and heavy\nbleeding is common, sometimes requiring\na transfusion. The woman is more likely\nto see her aborted embryo, adding to the\ntrauma already increased by the far\nlonger procedure as compared with\nsurgical methods. In 5% of cases, RU486\nfails to abort, making surgical abortion\nnecessary as well, heightening the\npsychological pressure on the woman.\nRU486 is still an experimental drug,\nwith nothing known about long term\nA Woman Speaks...\npregnant. With support she can carry on\nwith her work or education.\nDuring the course of the pregnancy,\nmany women find that the unwanted\nchild is very much wanted indeed.\nHowever, for those who still can't cope\nwith a baby, the choice of adoption is\nthere.\nAdmittedly adoption can be\ntraumatic\u2014'giving up' a child is not easy,\nbut what is abortion if not 'giving up'?\nWith adoption, you giving are giving your\nchild parents for whom a child is much longed for. An aborted child can give no\none joy or happiness.\nIn fact, abortion can be far more\ntraumatic than adoption. It can be\nphysically damaging to the woman's reproductive system, and in very many\ncases the woman is emotionally scarred.\nPost-abortion trauma is extremely\ncommon, and a very neglected condition.\nA woman can be press uri sed into having\nan abortion, and then discharged only to\nsuffer regret and confusion, with no backup support. Here, surprisingly enough,\npro-life groups such as LIFE and SP UC come into their own. Recently the pro-life\nmovement has suffered a great deal from\na small number of people standing\noutside abortion clinics hurling abuse and\neven debris at frightened young women entering and leaving. These people are\nno more a part of the mainstream pro-life\nmovement than the terrorists who bomb\nthe homes of scientists are part of a charity like Animal Aid. Both the\naforementioned groups recognise the\nconsiderable social pressure that leads to\nso many abortions, and while never\naccepting that abortion can be right, offer\ncounselling and support to women who\nhave had abortions, to help them come to\nterms with their loss.\nOf course, the hardest question to deal\nwith is that of rape. Rape is almost\ncertainly the most traumatic experience a woman can suffer, and it is argued that\npregnancy can only compound this\u2014a constant reminder to the woman of her\nordeal. Should then this be considered as\na special case? Any woman must feel a horror at the thought of rape resulting in\npregnancy. It was the most difficult\nproblem I faced when coming to my pro-life beliefs. How would I feel if it were to\nhappen to me?\nHowever the crucial fact cannot be\naltered. An unborn child is still a child. A separate, unique life has begun. There\ncan be no 'special case' when it comes to\nthe killing of a human being, wholly\ninnocent of any crimes committed leading\nto his or her conception.\nOn the practical side, studies have\nshown that pregnancy following rape is\nvery rare. The swift administration of\ndrugs after the rape can prevent\novulation and therefore fertilisation. (This\nis not the same as the 'morning after' pill,\nwhich is an abort if aci ent.) If the worst were to happen, and the\nraped woman became pregnant, then the\nsupport and practical help outlined above\nis available, along with the extra care\nand counselling a woman in that dreadful\nsituation requires.\nTo sum up then, abortion is not, and\ncan never be, the 'right' of a woman. An unborn child is not part of a woman's body, but genetically distinct\u2014a unique\nindividual\u2014and therefore a woman cannot have the right to decide whether\nit should live or die as part of her rights\nover her body. Abortion causes emotional\nand sometimes physical damage to a woman, with post-abortion trauma often\nbeing left un dealt with. A truly free\nwoman is one who recognises the\nhumanity of her child and can come\nthrough the social pressures of abortion,\neither to bring up the child for herself, or\ngiving it through adoption to a couple\nwho want it very much and can give it\nthe love it deserves.\nAs a woman who believes in freedom\nfrom any submission and equal rights for\nall human beings, I cannot be other than\npro-life.\neffects on fertility or health or the\nconsequences of repeated use, yet it\nseems likely that it will be licensed\nperhaps as early as this spring. We should\nquestion why the government is so keen\nto introduce an unproven drug which is\nmore oppressive to the women that will\nuse it than current methods of abortion.\nThe long term aim for RU486 is the\ncolossal potential markets of the Third\nWorld. As operating theatres and blood\ntransfusion facilities are thought essential\nprecautions for British use, attempts to\nuse the drug in areas where medical\nfacilities are lacking could be disastrous\nfor the women of the developing\ncountries, as well as the worrying\nprospect that a convenient method of\nabortion might divert attention for\nmethods of population control that do not\ninvolve the killing of the excess populace\nbefore birth. It would not be ridiculous to\nsuggest that the support the drug is\ngetting from western governments is not\nunconnected to a wish to reduce their\nresponsibility towards the developing\nworld.\nRights for the Handicapped\nIt's encouraging to see how much is being\ndone to help the handicapped in today's society. For example much is being done\nto ensure that, when applying for jobs,\ntheir rights to 'equal opportunities' are\nrecognised. On the practical side, no new\nbuilding is planned without taking into\naccount their special needs. And yet, the\nsame society that welcomes these\nchanges calmly requires that, whenever\npossible, the handicapped are killed\nbefore they are born.\nIt doesn't make sense. I can only think\nof one argument that would allow this\ndouble-think. However, rather than being\nan attempt to help the handicapped, it\nmerely aims to keep the rest of us happy.\nIt goes like this.... 'It must be a miserable\nlife, and it's awful living side by side with\nmisery. So, let's do all we can to make\ntheir life more pleasant\u2014so we feel less\nuncomfortable\u2014but get rid of all those\nwho are coming up.'\nSuch a point of view is not very\nappealing. Not only does it stink of\nselfishness, but, far more important, it\ndenies the very humanity of the\nhandicapped. We will all happily say that\nall persons are equal\u2014that means we\nexclude the handicapped. And so, the\nargument goes, what's to stop us killing\nthem after birth? And the follow-on from\nthat is\u2014what constitutes a handicap?\nOkay, it may sound far fetched, but it is\nthe logical conclusion.\nTo sort things out, we need to go back\nto square one. The handicapped are\nhuman beings\u2014noone argues with that.\nThis gives them the right to life itself,\nwhich urges us to help them live it, not\nkill them.\n\n"

The famous blasphemy\nDance\nIC Dance Club took four teams (16\ncouples) and seven ex-student couples to\nSheffield on Saturday February 2 for the\nSheffield inter-varsity competition. The Sheffield is often viewed as a warm-up to\nthe more competitive SUDA and IV DA events which will take place later this\nterm. The overall team results were not\nstartling, with both A and B teams\nranking third. Cambridge took both first\nplace trophies (which, incidentally, were\nwon by us last year) but we did win the\nTeam Knockout competition (won by\nCambridge last year!).\nOn an individual basis some of the\nresults were quite encouraging: Team\nWaltz was won( rather casually!) by\nJames Barron and Janet Bond( A team)\nwho also came first in the Open Viennese\ntrial of 'Gay News', prosecuted by Mary\nWhitehouse and her Christian 'moral'\ncrusaders, was for a poem by a gay\nChristian following this tradition: A tradition that goes back centuries. The film, Visions of Ecstacy, was made by two\nChristians, based on the erotic dreams of\na nun in the 19th Century. It was banned\nlast year in this country for blasphemy.\nTo examine why this was done and as a protest against the blasphemy law the TH Huxley Society will be showing this\nfilm in the Union Lounge at 1.15pm on Thursday 28 February. Come along and find out why it was banned. 50p entrance\n(free to members).\nWaltz. Gareth Davies and Christine\nBearpark (A team) took first place in\nTeam Jive. We thought that our A team\nCha ChaCh a couple Wendy Tan and Mark Highman were very unfortunate to\nhave been knocked out in the semi-final\nand would probably have been placed\nquite highly had they made it to the final.\nOur B team Cha couple Paul Ng and Sarita Chandrasekharan took 3rd place.\nIn the Open competitions Eric and Anne came second in Rock and Roll with\na very acrobatic routine\u2014well done! Ex students Steve and Nicki won the Open\nSamba but the fame went to Shuko\nNoguchi and Rachel Condor who entered\nwith a hastily put together routine as an all-girl couple, and shocked everyone by\ncoming sixth.\n16\n\n"

Even now after four\nweeks of war we feel it is not too late to\nnegotiate. You showed yourself to be a reasonable and amiable gentleman by the\nhelp you gave to the foreigners stranded\nin Iraq and Kuwait. Our leaders on the\nother hand are obstinate and pig-headed\nidiots whose refusal to negotiate is a damning indictment on our so-called\ndemocracy.\nFor the past month 'the Allies' have\nbeen bombing hell out of Iraq, and what\nhas it achieved? Your continued missile\nattacks on Saudi Arabia and Israel show\nthat the bombing is having no real effect\non your army, and obviously you don't give a toss about civilian casualties. A blok eI met in the pub said this war is\ncosting us over forty million quid a day\u2014\nthat's nearly half what the NHS gets! The\nTories are closing hospitals to pay for\nsomeone else's war, and we say enough\nis enough.\nHere's the plan: with everyone's attention turned to the Gulf (perhaps you\ncould turn the heat up a bit?) we the\npeople will rise up and si eze power,\nsmash the Tories, abolish the Poll Tax,\nand stop the Gulf War. We offer you this\nGod And...\nDear Andy,\n1. I won't admit my name because I'm scared? Bullshit. As I have said before, I won't tell you because it reduces my credibility when arguing the point. Would Mr Cooksley (892) accuse me of being\nfeminist if I were a' blok e'? Would I be\nra sci st if I were coloured? (Sorry, I'd like\nto check with the white majority out\nthere if I'm allowed to use the word coloured. No one seems to ask the\nminorities.) I will also admit that in my earlier letters I was deliberately\nin fl ma tory, and I don't promise not to do\nit again.\n2. In the letters' page most people put\nforward a premise, and draw some logical\nopinion and conclusions from it. The logic\nis often incorrect or the premise perhaps\nleaves things out. But you try. There is\nan exception to this rule. Christians put\ncompromise: if we pull all our troops out\nof the Gulf, you get out of Kuwait. You can keep everything you've nicked\u2014the\nKuwaitis are rich and will easily rebuild\ntheir country.\nIn fact\u2014what the heck\u2014you can keep\nKuwait. The girl at the c hippie reckons\nthe Al-Sabahs who ran Kuwait are\ndictators\u2014all 1200 of 'em. The people of\nKuwait aren't much better. The National\nUnion of Kuwaiti Students say they've\nbeen trying to get rid of the Al-Sabahs\nsince 1964. It only took us eleven years\nto get rid of our dictator, so clearly N UK S aren't trying very hard. They don't deserve a country of their own. Besides,\nKuwait has only been around since 1710,\nso they've no real historical claim to\nindependence.\nOn top of all that, we don't even need\nKuwait. Someone I was chatting to in the\nbog said they only produced 8% of the\nworld's oil, so even if you nuked the\nwhole place it wouldn't hurt us in the\nWest very much. Of course, you would\nhave to make a solemn pledge not to\ninvade Saudi Arabia or anywhere else;\nand keep that promise, not like the one\nyou made about not invading Kuwait naughty boy! In return we will remove all\nAmerican and UK forces and businesses\nfrom all Arabic countries; destroy all our\natomic biological and chemical weapons;\npay you substantial compensation for the\nmillions of civvies you say have been\nkilled; and make you honorary president\nof the London School of Economics.\nBest Wishes,\nUltan McCarthy, Secretary Rampton\nRejects against the Gulf War.\nforward a premise such as 'In Luke\n3:16...' This is not a valid basis for any\nargument unless you are debating the\nBible. It cannot be applied to any other\nsituation as the Bible (and. Koran etc) is\nheavily biased. Do you Christians believe\nthe book of Mormon, or the Moonies? No\nyou don't.I make a premise and conclusion and\ntry to answer any logical discussion.\nHowever you religious types do not allow\nany logical criticism of the Bible etc. 'It's true, God told me in prayer.'

Hub costs were not listed on last\nyear's college accounts and this has led to\nconfusion and suspicion about Hub's brief.\nAccording to Lady Clare Ash, in overall\ncharge of the office, Hub's activities are\nmanifold. One of her main responsibilities\nis the pastoral care of long-term academic\nvisitors and their dependants. Lady Ash and her assistant are particularly\nconcerned with the welfare of non-English speaking dependants; help can\nrange from finding part-time jobs for\nvisitors and their families to finding\nschools for visitors' children. Lady Ash pointed out that the Union is the official\ncaretaker of student welfare at Imperial\nand that, apart from the Hub office, there\nis no parallel organisation for academic\nvisitors.\nThe Hub office is also responsible for\norganising the Christmas Caper and\nSummer Fair. Hub also organises a series\na dinners throughout the year for new\nacademic visitors and new members of\nstaff.\nThe Lost Youth Theatre, 450 Fulham\nRoad, is holding two fundraising nights\nthis weekend.

His\nwedding tackle were then removed,\nallegedly with a tin opener.\nWhen ransomed back to K QC U for\n\u00a3100, his genitalia were not returned.\nInstead of which, they were hung behind\nthe bar in our Union Building (Beit Quad).\nAt about 8.00pm on Saturday K QC U, having occupied the bar and cleared an\nescape route out of the quad, removed\nReggie's wedding tackle from behind the\nLady Ash disclosed that there has been\nsome discussion about the creation of a new administrative post in the Hub office\nwith an ac como dati on brief.

The man, who failed to identify\nhimself as a student, was later released\nwhen the police could not prove the\nbicycle was stolen property.\nEarlier that day, the same man had\nentered the hall and offered to sell a bicycle to one of the residents for \u00a310.\nThe student accepted and paid a \u00a32\ndeposit. However, the student was\nsuspicious of the man's intentions and\ncontacted the warden, Ian Metcalfe. Mr Metcalf immediately informed the police,\nwho sent a plainclothes officer along to\nthe scene. Later that afternoon, when the\nman returned with a racing bike to the\nhall, he was met by the officer and\narrested.\nThe man was later released and given a warning for trespassing on private\nproperty. The student concerned, CH Wong, aPG student in Mechanical\nEngineering said; 'Well, it's a good deal.\nCheap for just \u00a310. The police couldn't prove it was stolen, so why not?'\nThe same man has been seen within\nthe College grounds on other occasions.\nAnother resident of the hall, Jean-Phillipe\nCarchano, recalled, 'Yes, this is not the\nfirst time I have seen this man, last time\nhe tried to sell aTV for \u00a35.'

    "content": "Carter USM\n-30 Something LP QqcLS Acre\nJim Bob and Fruitbat return to wreak\nrevenge on vinyl with their second album\n'30 Something'. Armed with the musical\nequivalent of two 15 pound\nsledgehammers they set about destroying\neverything in their wake. Anyone who\nhas the balls to start an album off with a mindless football chant ' You fat\nbastard...You fat bastard..' (Surfin' USM)\nhas got to have something up their\ncollective sleeves. Don't they?\n'Bloodsport For AH' their latest, much publicised and 'banned' single is one of\nthe best tracks on the album:\n'Suffer in silence said Brigadier General\nHolmes/or change your name to Smith or\nJones/Learn to live with all the death\nthreat notes/the big bananas and the\nracist jokes'\nHeavy stuff. Just reading through the\ninner sleeve notes you get an idea of\nsome overriding sadness that drives them\nto do what they do, but they wrap it up\nin fun pop songs and their meaning could\nalmost pass you by. Witty titles like\n'Sealed with a Glasgow kiss' raise an\ninitial laugh but the joke goes a bit stale\nafter a while.\nThe album is steeped in cynicism but\nwhen it comes to 'Falling on a bruise'. I'm sorry but I can't bele ive they're not\ntaking the piss.I could see them as the\nscene opens, Jim Bob and Fruitbat lying\nin the middle of the road, a ford Cortina\nstopped in front of them, its windscreen\ncracked and covered in blood. Looking\naround a crowd starts to gather and the\nambulance siren can be heard in the\ndistance. Then Jim( Fruitbat?) opens his\neyes and as the ambulance stretchers\nthem away the words come tumbling out:\n'You win some and you lose some\nand I 've lost the will to lose...'\nOh its so comically sad! Mixing in a dash of Red Dwarf, Michael Caine and\nlots of attitude Carter US M have made an\nalbum that kicks out in all directions but\nit never lose its sense of fun! Definitely\nrecommended.\nHarry Cross\nTrip the Light Fantastic\nThis band recently played two\nunder publicised gigs in College, in\nSouthside and the Union Lounge bar. This\nis a shame because they are one of the\ncleanest sounding and listenable groups\nthat I 've heard in a long time.\nThe music, apart from a few covers, is\na sort of fusion of early Talking Heads\nand strangely enough U2. Lyrically\nmeaningful the singer/rhythm guitarist's agile voice is backed up by an excellent\nbassist (on ah of ner acoustic a la Paul\nMcCartney) and drummer giving a very\nclean crisp sound.\nDespite the lack of numbers at the gigs\nthey managed to get the audience up and\ndancing and apparently went down very\nwell on both occasions, watch out for\nthem around College again, well worth a listen!\nSid.\nAll this from a man who manages the\nband\u2014M.Ed. \u2022Ten Gospel Greats LP\nGod's Acre\u2014the name may not\nimmediately spring to mind but those in\nthe know have been following the band,\nthrough its beginning as a solo project in\n'87 which gradually gathered members.\nFrom other no name bands in the\nChicago area, awaiting with eager\nanticipation, this their debut LP.\nImagine Jane's Addiction's hippy glam\nsound processed by Iain Burgess of Big\nBlack and Naked Raygun fame. The\nresulting meandering wobble through the\ndomain of 'sub-pop soft-core is a bit\nsmooth for my taste but does provide\nsome excellent tunes.\nThe album is full of contrasts. The\nsweetest guitar sound on rolling drum\nbeats is followed closely by deep flower\ngrooves all covered by deep throaty\nvocals. The accompanying tempo changes\nare welcome and sudden leaving little\ntime to catch your breath. Addictive and\ncatchy tunes make comparisons with\nNirvana's Sliver easy. But the vocals do\nseem to be added as an after-thought and\nare in most cases indecipherable.\nThere are two songs of epic\nproportions. The Jane's Addiction come\nBig Black sound really comes to the fore\nand if they were the only two good\ntracks on the album it would still\nrecommend you borrow it.\nSeb\nINTERESTED\nin reviewing an album/gig?\nSee FELIX Office\nfor details\n10\n\n"

    "content": "OPINION The Third World countries face huge debts.\nA Good Deal for th\nWhy is the world in the state it is? Why do some people starve, others wallow in\nplenty? Are things gradually improving?\nAnd are we in the West really helping to\nbring about a change for the better in the\nlot of the poor nations?\nThere has always been a feeling in the\nWest that the developing nations need\nour help. If only they could learn from\nwhat we have to teach them they would\nnot be so desperately poor. This was\nexactly the thinking which helped to\njustify the European empires in Latin\nAmerica, Africa and Asia. Today, of\ncourse, this kind of moral validation of\nthe European presence in these\ncontinents cannot stand up to any kind of\nscrutiny. It is quite apparent that the\nrelationship between Britain and India,\nsay was somewhat less than a symbiotic\none\u2014Britain was in India to exploit her\nresources and any gain on India's part\nwas minimal and incidental. However, I would suggest that this argument is not\nvery far from the one used today in\norder to justify Western actions, or rather\ninterference, in developing countries\ntoday.\nLet us start with the questions 'What is\naid?', 'What does aid really involve?' If we\nlook at the context in which financial\nhelp (be it loans or donations) is offered\nto developing nations, it becomes clear\nthat the intentions of the West are not\nentirely benevolent. One of the prime\nlenders of financial aid today is the World Bank. The World Bank was set up by the\nUSA and the major Western powers after\nWorldWar Two, with the aim of\nrebuilding war-torn Europe and Japan,\nand after that to promote financial\nstability, economic growth and a cooperation with the member states.\nToday there are 151 countries which are\nmembers of the World Bank\u2014most of the\ncountries except Warsaw Pact signatories.\nA condition of membership is that each\ncountry must contribute a certain\npercentage of its Gross National Product\n(GNP) for the Bank's use.\nMuch criticism has been made by the\npoorer members concerning the\nconditions which the World Bank sets\nbefore releasing loans to developing\ncountries. The undemocratic nature of the\nBank means that developing nations are\nalmost powerless to implement policies of\ntheir own choice: it is assumed that the\nWest knows more about the problems in\nMexico, for example, than the Mexicans\nthemselves. There seems to have been no\nchange in Western attitudes since colonial\ntimes. What determines the voting rights\nof countries in the World Bank is the size\nof their pocket. Thus the USA, Japan and\nall the industrialised countries have the\nmajority of the voting power\u2014the USA exercises 18.5% of the votes, while China\nhas only 2.5% despite the fact that its\npopulation is four times larger than that\nof the USA.\nWhat all this means is that the World Bank in effect acts upon policies laid out\nby the USA and other industrialised\nnations.\nThe poor nations have very little say\nhow the world economy should be run.\nThis has had a devastating effect upon\nthem. Over the last decade or so World Bank policies have been deeply\nunpopular in many countries.\nUnfortunately they are powerless to do\nanything\u2014they have been denied a voice.\nIt is generally agreed that the 1980's were an appalling decade for the poor\nnations of the world. Many people also\nargue that the World Bank helped make\nthings worse rather than alleviate the\nsqualor of the poor. The crisis was\nbrought about during the 1970s through\nthe massive borrowing by the\ngovernments of developing nations from\nbanks in the West which were\noverflowing with oil dollars from OPEC countries. These commercial banks (which\nof course include our friendly high street\nchums in this country) were very 'liberal'\nwith their lending policies. The interest\nrepayments were set at commercial rates,\nwhich seemed reasonable to both parties\nat the time. This was a period of\neconomic buoyancy and it seemed that\nthe developing nations might at long last\nbreak the vicious cycles of poverty.\nHowever this mood of optimism was not\nto last very long. During the late\nseventies, the West was set for a downward slide into recession. This\nbrought with it very high interest rates\nwhich meant that debt servicing\nrepayments by the poor to the rich\nnations were massively increased.\nHowever, high interest rates are not the\nonly problem. The fundamental problem\nthe developing countries face today is\nthat of inequality in the world markets\nimposed by the West. The system is\nrigged up in such a way that the value of\nmanufactured goods far exceeds the value\nof raw materials (excepting oil of course).\nIn the 1980s there was a sharp drop in\nraw material prices which meant that the\nWest would have even cheaper access to\nthem, whereas the value of manufactured\ngoods has steadily risen. So it is apparent\nthat the West is making a healthy (but\nsick) profit from the way the markets are\nstructured. As one economist put it:\n'The challenge for us is to eliminate the\nsenseless dichotomy which makes us\nwholesale exporters of raw materials, and\nwholesale importers of finished goods,\nunder terms determined entirely by the\nindustrialised countries, terms that compel\nus to increasingly produce and sell more\nof our raw materials in order to afford\nless of their products.' (Simba Maknoni,\n1989.)\nSo what solutions has the World Bank\nproposed? During the mid-eighties it came\nup with a gem called SAPs( Structural\nAdjustment Programmes). The Bank will\nonly allow governments to borrow if they\nagree to run their economies (and thus\nthe whole political structure of that\ncountry) the way the Bank dictates. (We\nmight recall the fur ore caused in this\ncountry by possible economic\nintervention of the European\nCommunity\u2014it would seem that some\nsovereign ties are very much more\nprecious than others). Structural\nAdjustment Programmes involve\nliberalisation of trade policies (i.e. reduction or even elimination of import\n8\ne West?\ntariffs), increase in production of cash-crops, and cuts in public spending (i.e. reduction of expenditure on health,\neducation, removal of subsidies on food,\ntravel and so on). As a result of these\npolicies, the condition of the poorest\nsections of these communities have\nsuffered the most, and in several\ncountries there have been 'food riots'\nwhen the strain has become unbearable.\nThe economies of these countries have\nexperienced a great step backwards\nthanks to the policies of the World Bank\nwhich is interested more in maintaining\nor 'looking after' the interests of the\nfinancial system set up by the\nindustrialised nations than improving\nconditions in the developing nations. The\nWorld Bank insists that any country\nborrowing directly from or seeking its\napproval (without which countries are\nunable to borrow from anyone) must\nmaintain its (crippling) interest payments\non loans borrowed in the seventies. Thus\nthese countries must earn lots of hard\ncurrency by selling as much raw material\nas possible to the west and then return it\nstraightaway in the form of interest\nrepayments. Unfortunately, since the\nBank has told many other poor countries\nto do the same, there has been a glut in\nthe commodities markets, resulting in\nprices going through the floor. So these\ncountries have ended up being much worse off today than they had been\nbefore the World Bank intervened.\nAt 'Third World First' we recognise that\nthe industrialised world has taken enough\nfrom the poorest countries in this world and it is time for the process to stop. If\nwe are too selfish and greedy to put\nanything back (and let's not kid ourselves\nthat we do) we should leave these\ncountries alone so that they themselves\ncan decide what kind of development it is\nthat they want to pursue.\nThird World First aims to increase\nawareness of issues concerning the\ndeveloping countries. At Imperial College\nwe regularly invite representatives from\nvarious groups (banks, charities, campaign\ngroups, etc) to hold talks, debates and\ndiscussions which will hopefully motivate\npeople to take positive action (however\nsmall) both now and after they leave\nCollege. These meetings are held almost\nevery Thursday at lunchtime\u2014look out\nfor posters in the JCR and around\nCollege.

By most yardsticks it\ndoes not conform to the stereotype of a 'third world' agency. No aid, no disaster\nrelief. Its work is more intangible,\nperhaps more far reaching. It sends\npeople\u2014skilled men and women aged\nanything between 20 ad 70 to work\nalongside local people in 48 developing\ncountries around the world.\nAnd last year it topped its own record\nwith over 1,300 professionals working\noverseas in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean\nand Pacific. The people V SO now needs\nare drawn from an immense diversity of\nbackgrounds. They range from\naccountants to builders, computer\nprogrammers to doctors, engineers\nthrough to zoologists and even the\noccasionally beekeeper.\nOne of the 1,300 currently overseas is\nformer Imperial College graduate Philip\nChurn who is now working as an\nelectrical lecturer at Ramat Polytechnic in\nnorthern Nigeria. As well as classroom\nteaching, Philip is renovating workshop\nmachinery and passing on practical skills\nto local colleagues.\n'It's hard work, but good fun,' he says.\n'After nine months here I'm finally\nsettling down. The two years will\ndisappear so fast though.'\nAll V SO jobs are for a minimum of two\nyears with pay based on local rates. Most\ninvolve a strong training element. Post\nqualification experience is also very\nimportant, although V SO always takes\ninto account practical work undertaken as\npart of a degree course and relevant\nvacation work.\nIf you'd like more information, please\ncontact the Enquiries Unit, V SO,317 Putney Bridge Road, London SW15 2 PN or telephone 081-780 1331.\n9\n\n"
