TAGG.\nMajor repairs had to be carried out on the\nMines Traction engine see ent ly, and it was decided\nto move Clemintine from the bomb site in Prince\nConsort Road to the Guilds yard.\nUnfortunately the monsoons had softened the\nearth after the summer draught, and more earth was\nmoved than the engine at the first attempt. The\nfollowing day, a group of g angers, foreman,\noverseers, consultants, advisers, and even onlookers\nassembled to see Clemintine leaning drunkenly to\nport contriving to flail the earth. Six hour!\nlater a rope was produced and the engine was pulled\noat quite easily w lt how t needing any of the wedge e planks or pulleys recommended.\nwhile resting OIL t foe rubbish dump in the\nGuilds yard, Clementine again developed a list to\nport. The angle of inclination shows the ma ahl me to have been under the weather, and it appears that\nits weight must be reduced or the parking sites\nmust be strengthened if the engine is to maintain\nan even keel. SCIENTISTS MEET TO DISCUSS NAMING The first E.C. S. Union meeting of the year was hex d on November 1st, under the Presidency of Brnie Guthrie,\nand the Vice-Presidency of Miss Paddy Clarke. The minutes\nthe last meeting ware quickly disposed of by the Hon. Seams*\ntar y. Alastair Pairbairn, and duly signed. ICLsa Clarke was\nthen invested with her p jk \u00bb Bonnet of office, loudly acclaimed by the appreciative Scientists.\nOn the sub j eot of Borphy Day. it was decided that a> party from the R.C.S. would te we l down on a party II mls a! the fire engine was going down to Putney, (with or without\n3p are hig-\u00abnds), and the Union was reminded that a gentleman's agreement between the colleges forbade interference with\neach others mascots.\nErnie Gutrorie informed the Union that it was contributing\n\u00a3250 to the proposed Exploration Board. Guilds and I.C. Unions giving \u00a3250 and \u00a3500 respectively, lines having no\nassets and \u2022therefore ra a ld jig no contribution. In answer to\nquestions, it transpired that- this was a sprat to catch a mackerel, in the form of large contributions from Societies\nsuch as the Geographical, however, on oe we had the* mackerel,\nit would be bad form to ask for the sprat back. Several\nmembers of the Union expressed concern over its large\nfinancial resources, and the hopes that the money could be\nused more profitably.\nThe subject of the fire engine was again \"brought up,\nseveral suggestions for naming it \"being put forward, mostly\nrelating to ancient and terrible monsters. The Union's decision, however, was postponed. The chairman of the\nEntertainments Committee asked for suggestion for the R.C.S.. Smoking Concert, wh i oh is- to *s held in December. Anyone\nwith ideas is asked to get in touch with him.\nThe meeting was closed with a hearty Kangella.\nThe H arlington Hop Hundreds watch November 5th Celebrations\nThis year, like last year, Guy yaw Kes\" Hop was\nheld at Harlington. The quiet Clubhouse was decorated with lanterns and streamers; two bars had been\narranged to cater for the hundreds who would soon\narrive, and soft music drifted soothingly from the\nloudspeakers as a last minute check of tha programme\nwas made. Out on the balcony a small group of men\nwatched the rockets ascending from another celebration about a mile away till a loud report at their feet made them realize that someone was watching them. In a few seconds there was a battle raging between the men on the balcony and the men in the Car-park - terminated violently by Sxkx's Bombs\nand a Rocket-Launcher, which parted the hair of one\nman indiscreet enough to raise his head too high.\nEIGHT BUS LOADS The departure from the Union was without the customary discharge of missiles as those present with\nand without tickets were conserving their supply\nof audible pyrotechnics for later in the evening..\nAs the buses arrived the passengers were\ngreeted by those already present with a vigorous\nbombardment from the balcony. Once inside, the new\narrivals hastened to join the defenders. Good use\nwas made of the bar which had fortunately been\nextended. Hot dogs were served by a scrum half\nwho would charge the mob at the door with a tray\nloaded with sausages wrapped with bread rolls. UP WENT THE SMOKE At 8.30 what appeared to be a London\nTransport bus enveloped in flames turned out to be the bonfire. The guy, which had previously\nbeen hung from the Beit Building flag-pole by\npersons unknown, was soon consumed by the flames,\nA vigorous free for all firework battle foil owed, in which a few of the girls s uc combe cL 'to shell shock. Those seeking refuge and a vantage point\nin the buses were routed out.\nWHIZZ BANG CRASH The Official Firework display followed. The\npieces ejecting missiles making a whistling sound\nwere particularly appreciated, but the pieces were\nrather spread out along the rug ger pitch, and seemed discontinuous. Dancing and celebrations contin=ued until11.30, and there was little of the fool ish throwing of fireworks into the Dance-Hall. One\ngentleman, if he can be sailed that, succeeded in ABOVE: A MAD SCKAMHE FOR HOT DOGS, WHICH WERE SUPPLIED FREE\nBT THE UNION. THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE GUT PAWKES HOP\nIS REAL VALUE FOR MONEY.\nsquirting an extinguisher in the crowded Barwith the result that many of both sexes received\nan ill timed douching.\nThe 'buses left from 10 pm onwards, but it was a pity that the earlier departures consisted\nmainly of girls doing a Cinderella act - who had\nto be in early. As many of the men were unable to buy tickets for their partners, it would have been\nbetter to limit the invitation a to Colleges whose\ninmates are allowed to stay out till a late hour.\nThe Dance was excellent for those wishing to take\nthat form of exercise - in fact, all those people\nconcerned; the Social Cluba, the Athletic Clubs,\nthe I.C. Executive and the Entertainments Committee\nmust be thanked for the excellent arran gm ents made.\n\n"

THE FUN LASTED A If you went down to the Morphy Day,\nXou were sure of a big surprise,.\nIf you went down to the Morphy Day,\nTou should have gone in disguise.\nWith R.C.S. in a bit of a mess,\nAnd Guilds all covered in water.\n( Written by a Miner.)\nThe various colleges went down to Morphy Day prepared for\nSPORT. The Guilds arrived with \"Bo\" at Putney at about 1.30.\nlater the R.C.S. appeared led by the Fire Engine, on board\nwh i oh were effigies of the Guilds' and Mines' Presidents.\nIn spite of the Guildsmens' and Miners' efforts, these were\nburnt outside the Boat House. The fight soB tinned sporadically\nwith s qui bs and fireworks, until the boats came in sight, when\na tru oe was called. Keith Miller, President of the Guilds, in\nfull regalia was ably defended by his supporters, except on\ntwo occasions when he and the spanner were rushed, nearly\ninto the water, by miners. Others were not so lucky, and\nthere were several casualties and ducking s. The Traction Engine hit a car, ran out of water several\ntimes, nearly blew its fusible plug and arrived as everyone\nwas going home, with no water and no steam. The crowd four\nhundred strong, were escorted home by the police, and\nfinally dispersed at '\n.\n.\n\"\n'\n.\nen Station.\nThe. ll orph y Race.\nResults of the draw gave Mines the Middlesex station,\nGuilds the centre and R.C.S. the Surrey shore.The sun had\ngone in, the water was choppy on the Middlesex side and the\nwind was blowing from the starboard bow.\nThe crews got off to a good start at Hammersmith\nBridge, but by Harrods, Guilds led R.C.S, by $ 'canvas, with\nR.S. M. half a length behind. By Crabtree the distances were\n\u00a3 a length and -| of a length respectively. Towards the mile,\npost the R.C. S.o ox wa3 steering a zig-zag course and crowding the Guilds boat; they were warned several times by the\numpire. The time at the Milepost was 3 mins. 16 sees., and\nthe positions were: C&6,|j. R.C. S.1l.R. S.M. Between the Milepost and the Football Grounds Mines\nspurted, moved into Guilds wash and nearly clashed with R.C.S, Guilds, however, were increasing their lead (to I3: 1.), with\nMines and R.C.S. level. The poor steering of the R.C.S. cox\nwas causing further loss of ground. The positions at Craven\nSteps were CS.S. Tif l.B.S. M.1 ft.- R.C.S.; at the\nBrook, C&G \u00bb- 1yU R. S.K. fL- R.C.S.; and at the.boat-house, C&G \u00bb- 21.- R.S. M.f[. BJ.CS. The time at the\nFinish was 8 mins. 15 sees., with Guilds winning by two\nclear lengths from Mines, who led R.C.S. by 1 ^ lengths.\n'Had Mine3 been awarded half a length advantage by the\nstarter, on account of their station, as the umpire suggest-ed, Guilds' lead at the Finish would probably have been only\none length clear.\nThe Lowry Race.\nThe stations for the race were the same as for the\nMorphy. Thirty seconds after the start of the Dowry, Mines\nclashed with Guilds, and Mines' bow broke a blade. A new one\nwas supplied from the launch, and the rao e was restarted.\nFrom the 3tart at the Milepost, Guilds went into the\nlead, and at the Football Grounds the positions were: C&&.1j j L.

WIN Round of U.L Cup During the opening phase of the game, King's kept on\ngetting the ball but I.C. held out with good defensive work.\nEarly on Hearni. missed a long penalty kio k at goal, but soon\nhe had another oha no e, and this time there was no doubt.(I.C.30). After a thrilling serum in front of the King's posts,\nBeam dropped a perfect goal. (I.C.60). By this time I.C were playing well together as a team - and then King's had\nthe misfortune to lose one of their centres with a broken an-kle. He later went to hospital. Hearn kicked two more good\npenalty goals before half-time, when the score waa 12-0.\nHhB 1.0. pack had not had enough of the ball during the\nfir at haj f; their sc rummaging in the set-scrum s was not good,\nalthough they were much better in the loose. Early an Doncaster dropped a magnificent goal to make the so ore150, and this was qui ok ly followed by another Hearn penalty :\n(18 - 0). At last the Hng*s line was crossed, after a ball\ncame to Balmer on the right wing (via Holman), and he soared in the corner. The attempted conversion failed (18 - 0).\nShortly afterwards Donoaster k ioke d ahead, followed up, took\nthe ball in the loose, and went over for a seo on dun converted try. This brought the final scare to I.C.24, King's0. We\nhad won -the first round! There was over a score of I.C. supporters watching; Mrs,Robinson enjoyed the game very much.\nOf the 1st XV, Toynbee, Hearn , and Dingle at scrum-half were\nstalwarts of the team.\nKING'S GET THE BALL BACK.

The second defeat in the U.L. league was suffered on Wednesday,Nov.2nd., against King's, the\nscore being 0-1.Once again play was very uninteresting. The 2nd.

Several new faces were\nwelcomed and the fact that Satuday Was November\n5th did not impair proceedings}quite the contrary\nThe speaker was Mr. \\I.R. Ridley, the visiting lecturer in letters to Imperial College. The\nsubject, \"Censorship\" proved difficult and rather\nelusive. Mr Ridley delivered a stimulating talk in which he successfully directed the course of the\nensuing debate and opened up interesting questions\non all forms of censorship. The debate then opened\nand covered subjects varying from Japanese films, through the meaning of freedom to Horror Comics,\nLater in the evening, nature provided l Jie r own GuyFawkes display with a brilliant lightning\nstorm; lightning struck the telephone wires and\nset fire to the switchboard. Several members of\nthe party succeeded in sleeping through the arrive)\nand departure of no less than three fire-engines.\nThe following morning saw several groups doggedly\ndefying the rain in their tours of the countryside.\nAt lunch the discussion was heartily re-opened.\nThe party returned to South Kensington at 5 o 'clock\nand without exe pti on all agreed that a very pleasurable and worthwhile week-end was spent.\n^l^ie e[( Lapoleen\nGuildsmen from the Engineering Sooiety entertained two\nFrench students during Commemoration Week . The Pranoh Boys\nwere introduced to London (l) and taken to the Ball at the-Dorohester.

The meeting will be held on Wednesday, 16th November at 2.30 in Motspur Park. The College\nteam will be relying on their- old-stage rs in some events,\nalthough in others everything must be left to the fresher s. Our prospects in the Relay seem brightest. In the 880 x mile\nx880 we have Bill Pain, John Evans and Les Looker John\nEvans won the 1500 metres in San Sebastian: Bill Pain was\nlast year's Captain of the U.L. Cross-Country Club: Les\nLocke is a promising pupil of Franz Stampfl.\nIn the throwing events we still have Phil Toyribee and are\nhoping that his strength has not waned over the close season.\nIm the dumping events the fresher s will be playing a leading\npart as kUk e Browne will not be available for either the\nLongjump or Hop, step, and, jump and Terry Hyslop is no\nlonger with us for the high jump. This meeting appears to\nbe a very good idea as it will keep up interest in winter\ntraining wh i oh does tend to become tedious without any\ncompetitive running.\nJ.S.

We beat Queen Mary College in the first round\nof the University of London Cup, with only a few\nminutes to spare. The play was lethargic in the\nextreme until ten minutes from the end. At this stage we were two goals down, but three quick\ngoals gave us victory. In the next round we are\nto meet University College, who beat Chelsea\nPolytechnic 15-0.\nA hard, fast and thoroughly enjoyable game\nwas played at Cambridge against St. Catherines\nCollege. In spite of the fact that they play\nthree or four times a week, we lasted the pace\nbetter and should have won, but for a goal scored\nin the last minute.\n\n"

At Ludgate Gardens another\n\u2022an hoisted the Guilds' Crest high up a lamp-post,\nand although rain was falling, it did not dampen\nthe spirit of the College. King's College threw a certain amount of toilet paper, which will probably\nbe put to good use in Guilds'. When the floats ar-rive d, \"Boomalakas\" thundered from the crowd to them\nand back again!\nThe procession stopped just past the Aldwioh\nwhere the students on the floats were given an\nhour's rest, meat pies, sandwiches, and coffee.\nOn the return route, Guilds' passed an assembled\nmob of King's students. The cheers turned to boos\nwhen the latter viewed the former, but a stunned\nsilence fell quickly as the Guildsmen doffed their.\nGUILDS' PRESIDENT ARRIVES IN BO. WITH SPANNER,\nEven as the sky grew darker above, and the\nrain clouds gathered, the scene in Moorgate became more picturesque and colourful as the floats for the Lord Mayor's Show arrived, and students\ndressed in gay carnival fashion took their places\non them. An unknowing passer-bye might easily have\nthought that the citizens of past ages had risen from their graves, and indeed the pages of history\nwere turned back for a few hours. King's College\nand City and Guilds' College manned the floats. The theme \"Wool through the ages\" was illustrated by everyday vestment, and Colin Smith looked realistic enough in his Lieutenant Colonel uniform to\nbe saluted by a regular private of the Royal Signals.\nThe procession was full of the colour and\npageantry which has become so much a part of the\nShow. Headed by the Horseguards and the Royal\nMarines, the procession made its way through the\nCity streets to the music of eleven bands, and\nthe cheering crowds lining the route made it clear\nfrom the start that the persistent rain was not\ngoing to act as a damper. After the more austere\npageantry of the Guards and the Cavalry, the Londoners who packed the pavement found light relief in the gaily-decked floats manned by even more\ngaily decorated students.\nThe main body of Guilds' - over 200 - travel led down by tube to Blackfriars. On the way, an elderly gentleman descended from train, called a por-ter, and explained that he had an \"uncomfortable\"\njourney. The porter entered the carriage, and was\nimmediately ejected with a barrage of missiles of\na non-lethal nature. When the Guilds' reached the ii destination, an inspector tripped over, and was un\nmulti coloured head wear in unison,\nReggie (King's mascot) -md placed them over their hearts in mock fun e rial eve rence. This action was\nfollowed by a steady stream of orange peel which\nliberally covered the front ranks of the King's men, women and children.\nTowards the end of the Show the floats were\nseparated f roni the bands, and those upon them were\nasked to make their way back to the Hall in which\nthey changed. They came upon a band marching in strict tempo - and joined it in an orderly fashion\nmuch to the amusement of the crowds. And so ended\nthe 1955 Lord Mayor's Show.

The\nHall had the atmosphere of antiquity, for around\nthe tall walls is a collection of weapons and the\nskill of craftsmen which would shame any museum.\nAt this Party, were the representatives of the\nEngineering professions - all of them Centralians - to help and advise future technicians of\nindustry. It would be unfair to mention one firm\nin preference to another, for their \"salesmen\"\nwere all persuasive. Most of the s tudes its who\nwent were surprised by the co-operation which\nexists between the College and the Centralians.\nThe meeting lasted for two and a half hours,\nduring which time a large quantity of beer and\nhot-dogs was consumed, and at least one person felt his qualms had been assuaged.\nEXPLORATION BOARD MEETS At the preliminary meeting of the Imperial\nCollege Exploration Board held on Thursday, 3rd. November, it became clear that there is an urgent\nneed for publicity to be given to the fact that\nthe Board is now ready to receive details of exploration schemes.\nThe Board will hold its first full meeting\non Thursday 15th December, and students who have\nexploration schemes for consideration by the Boarc\nat this first meeting are invited to send details\nin writing to Mr. E. Fairhurst, Imperial College\nOffice - before 1st December. The Board wishes to make clear that applications will be received at\nany time in the future for consideration at later meetings.\nApplications should contain the following\nminimum of information set out in the clearest\npossible manner.\n(1) The proposed destination of the expedition.(2) The purposes and the results expected.\n(3) The number of members.\n(4) An estimate of the cost.\n1LV0 VS C0LIH\nThe Moscow Dynamos team spent the evening of\nNovember 5th walking around Kensington. It is interesting to speculate what their reactions would\nhave been had they tried this en u u y Fawke's Day\nsome years ago.\nMeanwhile the police were as busy as ever in Trafalgar Square - but hot with students; disturbing as this may seem, the mighty influence of\nSenate House does not seem to have penetrated to\nthe teddy boys.\nKing's engineers recently built a bridge\nfrom their College to their Union to show the\nsomewhat slow builders that it could be done. How\nabout it Guilds? - this year's Engineers Ball in the second floor of our Union?\nSelkirk Hall, in their rocket war with the\nnearby women's college, used a new-type weapon\nincorporating a war-head. The return broadside\nwhich came the next morning was even more effective - a bill for damage.\nTed Smith informs me that 2,852.5 gallons\nof draught beer were sold from the bar between\nOct.1st.1954 and Oct.1st.1955. As there are 2,066\nstudents at I.C., the arithmetic mean is not very\ninspiring,but the distribution would probably be\nastounding.\nMines appear to have encountered considerable\ndifficulty in \"de-bogging\" their traction engine.\nThe only solution I can offer is putting a cat\nunder f.t and sending for the R.S.P.C.A. The first awards listed in the King's News\nunder the heading \"Sports Awards\" are for debating\nand chess, K.C.L. are obviously ne up on us in these fields, but we hope the boating Society\nlad plenty of sport in their fixture with Bedford\nan Tuesday.\nPassers-by last Th-irs day were amused to see\nR.C.M. flying their flag for the visit of the\nQueen Mother, and a guy hanging from the flagpole*\n\u2022ver the Beit Building! ill!! R.C.M. sent a letter to Chem Tec. asking them\nto refrain from making too much smell; it is time\nwe sent them a letter asking them not to make too\nmuc b noise.\nReaders of the suggestions book in the old Union will appreciate the contribution by Bugs\nGuthrie of a dirty spoon selo taped to the page.\nShould Mr. Mooney's answer be a clean spoon, this form of suggestion is likely to continue, much to\nthe detriment of the book.\nThis December Q.M. C. intend to have a Charity Rag week much on the lines of those run\nby certain provincial universities. We will watch\nthis innovation with interest as it may eventually\ngrow to something involving the whole university.\nDIG THAT CRAZY JAZZ The temperature rose for a couple of hp urs in the\nAyrtort Hall on Friday Nov 4th. as the I.C. Jazz Group\nheld its first practice session of the term.\nTerty HacVee, a member of the old group, led an cns em ble i* of piano, guitar, double bass, oboe , trombone, and drums.\nThe latter, un dismayed by a complete abs oen ce of conventional\npercussion instruments, performed brilliantly on a collection\nof old tin lids. After a few preliminary runs the group\nSettled down and pro duo ed some passable numbers. The double-baas played well, but the noise ratio was too much dominated\nby the brass. If the group can find a pianist up to their\nstandards and pra ot ice regularly we o an look forward happily\nto many noisy hours at coming carnivals.\nFELIX DANCE\nFELIX DANCE\nFELIX DANCE\nF EL: FEL\n111!
