    "content": "SPORT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LAWN\nTENNIS CLUB\nThe ICT C has the use of eight\ntennis courts, two hard courts behind\nL instead and six grass courts at\nHari in gt on. Obviously, the grass courts are subject to the weather, and\nas such, they are not available to play\non until the summer term.\nOn joining the Tennis Club (sub-script ion \u00a31 paid to the Treasurer) all\nthe courts are available to play on. A booking system, with sheets up on the\nTennis Club Board in the Sports Centre, is operated throughout the\nyear for the hard courts.\nThe Tennis Club runs both mens\nand ladies teams during the summer\nterm. The opposition is mainly other\nLondon colleges and local clubs.\nIf you would like to be considered\nfor one of the teams, can you please\ncontact Simon Middleboe, Civ Eng 3\nas soon as possible.\nA practice will be held on the first\nWednesday of next term, with our first\nmatch on the following Saturday. In\nview of the weather and the danger of\nlosing that practice, the club officers\nwill be on the L instead courts on Wednesday19 th March at around2:00 pm in order to see the relative\nstandards of those interested. Come along it you want to make an impact.\nCLUB OFFICERS Captain: Simon Middelboe, Civ 3\nFixtures Sec: Tony Tsoukkas, Civ 2\nTreasurer: Dave Cornwall, Mech 2\nLadies Captain: Sara McGuiness, Elec 2\nTABLE TENNIS\nHi folks! It's me again! Or rather it\nisn't, in fact, it's someone completely\ndifferent. I must write this week's report rapidly as Captain Beaky is hot\non my trail.\nIC1 vs Exiles: 7-2\nAnother good result as the first team\nmarch on towards the fourth division\nchampionship. A rare performance here from Kumar (I'm not overweight\nreally) Singarajah and Khartik (I really\nam overweight) Lakhani.\nIC1 vs Hong Kong Students: 5-4\nA poorer result than expected, but the\nfirsts still going well.\nIC2 vs INCO: 1-8\nA pity, this result, in view ot the\nsecond team's recent good form. AT ye winning the solitary set (some\ninsult about A Tye would have been\ninserted here, but he was threatening\nme with a Mooney).\nIC2 vs NALGO: 4-5\nA good result for the seconds against\nthe third placed team. Bob Edde doing\nwe l to win two of his three sets.\nIC3 vs EC & FS MAN: 4-5\nDisaster! The thirds lose their first\nleague match of the season to one of\nthe weaker teams in their division. The\nthirds display showed about as much\nlife as a school of Japanese dolphins.\nI Reed was particularly weak, his\nfeeble thrashings resembling the death\nthroes of an arthritic earthworm\nIt should be pointed out here that\nthe resemblance between A Cowling\nand a chimpanzee is purely coincidental\nvicious rumours that his mother was\nGuy the gorilla are completely without\nfoundation, Guy was his father.\nIC3 vs MARKS & SPARKS: 7-2\nA makeshift team including a fourth\nteam player and Kit Nair, playing his\nfirst league game, achieved a good victory over the fourth placed team.\nIC4 vs TWA: 7-2\nOnly a dazzling display by Pete Hewkin, who lost two sets, prevented\nthe fourths from demonstrating that\nthey really are as good as the third\nteam.\nANNOUNCEMENT!\nThe Table Tennis Club AGM will be\nheld on Wednesday19 th March at\n2:00pm in the Table Tennis Room. All\nmembers are invited to attend and are\nreminded that should they be foolish\nenough to want to be club president,\netc, next year, they should put their\nnames down with one proposer and\ntwo second ers by this date.\nMust slither now,\nHissing Sid (Supersnake)\nIC SAILING\nThe team travelled to Bradford this\nweekend, to sail in the Bradford Barrel\nteam competition. Twelve universities\nentered including a team from Dublin\nand one from Holland. A two day league was held in which IC started\noff well winning their first three matches. Their first defeat came against Edinburgh, who went on to\nwin the Barrel. The team finished third\noverall, but had the second best points, loosing only three races.\nTeam: Ian Robson, John Williams,\nGeof Titmus, Alan Beany, Chris Lewis\nand James Baxter.\nSKI CLUB AGM AND\nELECTIONS\nAll you budding Stenmarks or Wenzels\nplease slalom your way down to the\nUnion Senior Common Room on Thursday 20th March at 1:00pm for the\nelections. If you want to stand for a post\non the committee please sign your name\non the Ski Club noticeboard (right of\nstairs, Union ground floor). *\nIf any IF ladies are reading this,\nperhaps one of them would like to stand\nas a rep for next year?\nHappy schussing to you all.\nLINSTEAD UNBEATEN\nLast Sunday, at about1:00 pm a slightly inebriated L instead team staggered to Hyde Park to find the\nmassed hordes of Falmouth Hall facing them.\nUndaunted by this, and the lack of\nsleep, Linstead took a two goal lead\nthrough the work of Mark Fuller. Unfortunately one of Mark's shots hit\nAdam and so that goal goes down to\nhim. Falmouth were then given a dubious free kick on the edge of the\npenalty area. This was tapped to John who scored.\nTheir captain, Harry, then scored and also the other John, again with a good shot from the outside of the box.\nSoon after halftime, L instead scored twice, Mark scoring both to\ncomplete his hat trick. Linstead held\nout until five minutes from the end\nwhen along throw resulted in a header from Kev going in off the\ninfamous Pat Ch own. The final score of four apiece was\nfair and keeps up Linstead's unbeaten\nrecord u ner their captain, Dave Forshaw. Both teams played cleanly\nand the game was enjoyed(?) by\nseveral supporters. Thanks to the\ntimekeeper, Dana, from Falmouth.\nTEAMS Linstead: Phil, Dave, Nige, Phil, Dave\n(capt), Richard, Dimitri, Ian, Mark and\nlast, but by now means least, Adam. Falmouth: Lito, Bal, AlDo og, Kev,\nJohn, John, Neil, Harry, Mike and Neil.\nAlso, a big thank you for the supporters of both teams.\nUNIVERSITY OF LONDON CUP\nFINAL\nIC 4th s vs LSE 2nds FREE COACHES TO THE\nGROUND\nForget Wembley! This year's football\naction is at Motspur Park, tomorrow,\nSaturday 15th March. Giant Killers IC\nfourths take on the ham-fist ed pros of\nLSE in the first great battle of the 1980s. Progress to this final has been as\ninevitable as it's been spectacular. The first to fall were R CH thirds by four goals\nto nil, quickly followed by Goldsmith's thirds61, a precursor to greater victories and score lines. The quarter\nfinal showed our real character when we\ndefeated the optimistic and determined\nQM C thirds by three goals to two in a fast and bruising match. The semi-finals\ngave the only 'hick-up' when after extra\ntime we drew one all with K CH seconds\ndespite our apparent superiority. However,' the next week still sickened\nand annoyed by our earlier performance\nwe smashed them eight goals to nil in a furious blitzkrieg of attacking football.\nFive games, twenty-two goals for, five\nagainst, can such entertainment be\nmissed?

You\nstill have my heart.\nBarney McCabe\nPhysics 2\nDear Colin\nWe think it is time everyone\nwas made aware of the issues\nconcerning this week's edition\nof Forward.\nForward was banned last\nMonday by the elections committee on the basis of unfair\ncomment on the sabbatical\nelections. Comment on the\nFELIX elections was deleted\nbefore publication, following\nprotests from some of the\ncandidates. We freely admit\nthat there are justifiable criticisms that can be made; notably\nthat we attempted to distribute\nForward on the morning of the\nelections. Also, we should have\nasked the candidates about their\nideas more fully. We apologise if'\nany candidate feels they were\nunfairly treated; our intention\nwas to provide an honest\nelection commentary.\nHowever, we absolutely defend our right to comment on\nUnion elections in a fair manner.\nIt is the right of any club or\nindividual to voice considered\nopinions and stimulate thought\nand discussion. As a political\nclub it is our role to present ideas\non local as well as national issues.\nIt is important that alternative\nvoices exist to complement\nofficial Union publications. We\nwould resist most strongly any\nattempts to suppress independant publications, as an attack\non open debate and discussion.\nYours sincerely\nPhil Cole, Secretary\nStephen Goulder, Treasurer\nMatthew Huntback, Publicity\nOfficer\nDinesh Singh\nIC LIBERAL CLUB Dear Sir\nIn reply to Lee Paddon's letter in FELIX (Issue no 547), I sincerely hope that another\nopportunity to discuss the Boat\nClub tour to South Africa will\nnot arise. Surely it is just this\nattitude of 'flogging a dead\nhorse' that makes Union meet-in gs, boring, repetitive and\ntherefore poorly attended. I would have thought it had\npenetrated the minds of most\n'motion proposer s' that students\nat IC are bored to their back\nteeth with the same motions\nappearing with monotonous regularity, I certainly am.\nYours sincerely\nDRE Cornwall\nSir\nWith regard to the qualities\nrequired for leadership in\nindustry, I think it could be\nargued that academic superiority\nis irrelevant. So I do not see a future 'entrance requirement'\nthat any lecturer must be able to\nlead a dustmen's strike \u2014 not\nthat I am suggesting that any of\nthe academic staff could not save\nLeyland at a moments notice.\nI would (respectfully) suggest\nthat Professor Brown should\ntake more notice of the current\nacademic structure of Guilds.\nWe already have four classes in\nMechanical Engineering: Four\nyear course, Total Technology,\nJoint Honours, and Ordinary\nHonours.\nI would also suggest that the\ndeath of FELIX cartoons has\nbeen made up for the printing\nerrors. What a' book ship' is\n(John Tidy's manifesto) I'm not\nsure, but I can see how appropriate it is for Dram soc's farce to\nmention 'police farces'. I agree\nthat the playwright is not well-known in Britian.\nWho wrote the ICWA sweatshirt ad? It struck me as being\ncrude and sexist.\nIn the article 'How To Vote'\nour Hon Sec states that sabbaticals \"represent you, not them-selves. I feel that in practice, this\nis not true. Roger Stotesbury\ntold me last week that he did not\ncare about the image of Imperial\nCollege. For the eighty percent\n(approximately) of IC students\nwho live out, and dare I say it \u2014 I certainly do \u2014 the 86% of\nstudents who are male, going to\nsocial events at other colleges is\noften more interesting, more\nconvenient, or both, than going\nto IC dos. Imperial doesn't own\nus, and we know it. Yet our\nreception at other colleges, etc,\nis tarnished by IC's reputation,\nwhich in turn puts off students\n(etc) elsewhere from coming to\nIC events.\nYours faithfully\nKen Strachan\nMech Eng 2 TT Dear Colin\nOn the back page of FELIX,\nlast week, there was an article,\nout ling plans to excavate gravel\nat Harlington. Whilst agreeing\nwith much of what is said,\nthere are however several\nquestions that I would like to\nask: Why has this issue come\nto light now? (who approached\nwhom and for what purpose?);\nWhat would a \u00a3'/2 million\nsports centre extension consist\nof?; Could that money be put\nto better use?\nI would challenge the assertion\nthat \"the only inconvenience to\nCollege and students would be\nthe loss of some pitches.\" I would\nalso criticise the vagueness with\nrespect to the royalty expected.\nMy slide rule tells me that the\ndifference between a35p/ tonne\nroyalty and a60p/ tonne royalty\nwould be a substantial \u00a3357,000.\nA start-to-finish timescale of four\nyears I regard with scepticism.\nI would be very pleased if\nRoger Stotesbury, or anybody,\ncould answer these questions.\nYours sincerely\nColin Batchelor\nMech Eng 2\nSir\nThank you for explaining\nthat I am not a sabbatical\ncandidate.\nI was, however, most upset\nthat you omitted to print the\nmanifesto for a presidential\ncandidate (fully proposed and\nseconded) that I penned.\nWhilst on the subject of\nelections I can assure you that\nthe Coca-Cola trick does not\nwork. However, dipping one's union card into ES B has the\neffect of partially melting the\nplastic covering thus sealing\nany small circular holes which\nit may bear. The name also\nbecomes barely readable owing\nto a frosting effect on the\nplastic. By this method I have\nfound if possible to vote several\ntimes. After this I couldn't actually find my way out of\nStan's bar, otherwise I am sure\nI could have continued indefinitely. Is this sufficient grounds to\nhold a new election, to be\nmonitored by an internationally\nagreed peace-keeping body?\n(This time I am considering\nstanding for a post myself.)\nYours\nRavel\nOn Tuesday 18th March #t1:00 pm STOIC will be featuring\nThe Making Of Rocky 2 _ STOIC can be seen in the JCR,'\nUnion, Southside Lower'TV Lounge and on Channel 21 in\nBeit, Southside and Linstead Halls\n2\n\n"

There has\nbeen some discussion on the merits of\nthe nine day election campaign as\ncompared to last years twenty-one day\nposter battle. The short period has\nproduced a high turnout, but, for\ncandidates who have names that are\nunfamiliar to the electorate, a short\ncampaign is a disadvantage.\nGuilds \u2022\nIn contrast to the ICU elections, Guilds\nvoted for their new Exec on Tuesday.\nThis year Guilds introduced a new method of voting. The paper ballot\nsystem with stand-downs from President\nor Vice President was chosen to replace\nthe old system which was based on voting\nby a show of hands and had unrestricted\nstand-downs. There were about five\nhundred Guildsmen at the meeting which\nis approximately 25% of the total number\nin C&G. At first I would have advocated a departmental paper ballot, but such a high turnout to the U GM meant that\nmost students who would have voted in\ntheir departments turned up to the\nmeeting. It is satisfying to -vote and then\nbe told the result within a few minutes.\nThe new system has proved to be a success.\nCongratulations to the new President, Pat\nLeggett. I worked with Pat, last summer,\nwhen he was producing Spanner. Although\nthe two other candidates for Guilds President put up a good fight, Pat deserved\nto win. However, I would like to make a special mention of Dave Gayer. Dave\nmanaged to win 139 votes which is pretty\ngood considering that he's only in his first\nyear at IC. It is perhaps worth looking at\nthe points raised by Dave during his\nelection speech for Guilds President.\nDave said that Guilds Union needed to\nhave less emphasis on drinking with a broader range of events in Freshers'\nWeek. He said that Guilds events were\nonly attended by the same faithful few\nand that College would not continue\npaying out money to Guilds just to see\nthe Union cater for a handful of people.\nDave's comments could well be applied to\nICU. By still continuing all the activities\nassociated with drinking, but by introducing\nevents that do not require booze, we can\nshift the emphasis away from drinking. A good example was last Saturday's Deaf\nChildren's Party. IC students found\nsatisfaction in entertaining the children\nand the kids had fun as well. We need\nmore events held at Imperial that benefit\nthe community rather than the brewery.\n\u2022 Term Ends\nAs the last few days of the spring term slip\nby, my x ray eyes can see through the walls\nof the halls of residence and there I notice\nhundreds of students rapidly finishing off lab\nreports and other course work. Why not\ntake a break and come as 'your favourite\nAmerican' to the J CR tonight? It looks like\nit's going to be a great party. I know I'm all\nfor events that do not rely on booze, but\ntonight I could become the first sabbatical\nto be convicted of failing a breath test\nwhile driving a wheelchair!\nNext Friday, 21st March, there'll be an\nend of term FELIX. Don't miss it. I hope\nto include some special competitions for\nyour entertainment on the way back\nhome.\nCheers!\nThis is the regular paragraph where I say\n'Cheers!\" to everyone who has helped\nwith FELIX and also to those who have\ngiven me a push around College. I even\nmanaged to get to last Saturday's Willis\nJackson party with Chris Callow's help.\nI'm not sure whether Bruce Willis\ndeserves to be mentioned in this part of\nthe Editorial after he stripped down my\nwheelchair at the Guilds U GM, but at\nleast he put it back together again!\nA special thanks to Jeremy Nunns who\nhas been fetching and carrying for me as\nwell as helping.with FELIX. Cheers Jeremy!\nFinally, on a rather obscure note . . . I have already got two notches in my\nplaster.

    "content": "IC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA CONCERT Conductor: Richard Dickens\nLeader: David Bogle\nSoloist: Colin Bradbury\nIt's not often that IC's Music Society\npresents a soloist as distinguished as Colin\nBradbury, the principal clarinettist of the BBC\nSymphony Orchestra. Many times your\nreviewer has heard Mr Bradbury as soloist with\nthat orchestra, although at several times the\ncost of this concert. It is a pity that so few IC\nstudents turned up to hear this very enjoyable\nperformance, albeit in the inadequate acoustics\nof the Great Hall, in fact no more than to a typical Ents concert.\nThe evening began with a performance of\nSibelius' suite \"Karelia\", unfortunately, not too\nwell. The string writing in particular of the first\nmovement is rather tricky, not to say athletic,\nand the players tackled the second movement\nmore happily. As one of Sibelius' professors is\nsupposed to have said to a colle gue: \"If you'd spent half your life up to your neck in snow,\nyou'd write stuff like that too.\"\n- Once the initial suggestions of television\ncurrent affairs programmes are over, the\nKarelia suite, and especially the second\nmovement, actually suggests the snow covered\nlandscapes of northern Scandinavia. By the\nthird movement, which is the liveliest, the\norchestra had 'warmed up', and the brass\nsection made the most of their moments of\nglory.\nProbably the most interesting part of the\nprogramme was the concerto, written at the\nturn of the century by Stanford, who later\nbecame professor of composition at the place\nbetween Mines and Aero Eng. His name is\nbetter known as a teacher of a more successful\ngeneration of British composers, than for his\nown music. Neither this early concerto for\nclarinet nor those for piano are often\nperformed.\nThe ICSO responded to Colin Bradbury's participation by playing their best. The\nconcerto is reminiscent of Brahms, in man v places, but even a confirmed Wagnerite such\nas myself couldn't hold that against such a pleasant work. The influence of Brahms is\nclearest in the slow movement, where the\nstrings recede to the background, behind\nconcertante woodwind. The only concerto of\nits generation to which I could turn for a comparison was that of Nielsen, indeed I recall\na performance of this concerto by the same\nsoloist several years ago. The solo clarinet part\nin Stanford's concerto is much less energetic,\nwithout cadenzas as such, but becomes quite\nlively in the final movement. The composer\nwas born in Dublin, and his music is much\ninfluenced by Irish folk music (eg, his five \"Irish\nRhapsodies\"); so this finale does for the jig\nwhat Richard Strauss and Liszt did for the\nwaltz, or Malcolm Arnold for the Scots reel.\nThe listener could almost imagine a Ceilidh\nwith the clarinet substituted for fiddle,\nbecoming wilder and wilder as the night went\nby.\nAfter the interval, re vitali sed by coffee, we\nreturned to hear the \" Great C Major\"\nsymphony by Schubert. The programme got\nhis dates wrong twice; Schubert in fact died in\n1828 at the early age of thirty-one, and it was a tragedy for music that his life was so brief. In\nthat time he produced not only nine symphonies\nand other orchestral music, but also about a thousand songs, many of which are still top of the\nclassical pops.\nAlthough this symphony tries too hard for\nthe grand manner that Brucker could later\nachieve so easily, like all of Schubert's music, it\nsucceeds because of its tunes, even if the main\ntheme of the last movement is suspiciously\nsimilar to that of another ninth symphony.

    "content": "JEWS IN THE USSR\nTHE CURRENT SITUATION\nThe situation of Soviet Jewry during 1979 markedly\ndeteriorated in several areas. This was reflected in the figures\nfor emigration which reveal that more Jews applied for exit\nvisas than in any previous year, whilst in consequence, there\nwas an increase in the number of emigrants \u2014 approximately\n55,000 Jews left the USSR in 1979 \u2014 there was a proportionately large increase in the number of refusals. In\nLeningrad, for example, there are between 400-500 refuse nik families at present, as opposed to 150 this time last year. In\nMoscow the number is far higher.\nThe Soviet authorities are making it more difficult to\nreceive an exit visa by steadily increasing restrictions of one\nsort or another. The latest 'reason' for refusing to grant\npermission to emigrate is that the applicant has no close\nrelatives in Israel. The difficulties facing applicants are\nparticularly acute in the Ukraine which has long been the\nmost virulently an ri semitic area of the Soviet Union. It is\nreported from there that new excuses are being invented\nregularly in order to 'justify' the refusal of an exit visa. The\nauthorities now insist, for example on the application being\nmade by an entire family \u2014 parents, children, grandparents,\naunts, uncles and cousins \u2014 and that the absence of any of\nthese will be fatal to the application. At the same time it is\nreported that many regional offices of OVIR, the emigration\nagency, have simply closed down for long periods.\nWhat is equally disturbing is that there are signs of a new\nwave of repression directed against refuse nik s. In some\ncases, this takes the form of hurting refuse nik s through their\nchildren of student age. A number of Jewish students have\nbeen expelled from their colleges in recent weeks, and the\nauthorities are believed to be moving to conscript them.\nOther refuse nik s have been dismissed from their jobs \u2014 the\nprelude to a charge of 'parasitism' (not having a job).\nIt has now become widely known that the authorities are\ndetermined not to allow any demonstrations by refuse nik s and others to 'mar' the occasion of the Olympic Games. In\nconsequence, it is anticipated that all the leading refuse nik s will therefore be in prison, under house arrest or sent out of\nthe city in time for the Games.\nMAKING ENDS MEET AT EASTER\nSupplementary Benefit\nIf you are staying on in London and paying rent during the\nvacation U12 chances are that you can get most of the money\nthat you have to pay in rent back from the DHS S( Department of Health and Social Security) in the form of\nSupplementary Benefit.\nHow To Claim\nRing up the nearest DHSS Office and tell them that you want\nto claim for your rent during the vacation. Ask if you can\nmake an appointment for an interview and ask about the\nprocedure that they want you to follow and addresses of\nplaces that you have to visit before going to see them. The\nusual procedure once you have fixed up an interview is to\nvisit a Job Centre and see whether or not they have a suitable job for you. If they haven't take the form that you\nwu l be given at the Job Centre to the nearest Department of\nEmployment Office and sign on as unemployed. Take the\nform that they give you along to your DHSS interview. You\nwill also need proof of your resources eg bank statement and\nsaving books. You will then have to sign on every week as\nunemployed.\nPoints To Watch\nTo claim Supplementary Benefit you need to be unemployed\nand available for work. At the interview they may try and get\nyou to say that the reason you are staying in London is so\nthat you can study. In such a case they may well say that\nsince you are studying you can't be available for work and so\ncan't claim.\nThe impact of the tense international situation will be to\nworsen still further the situation of Soviet Jewry. To a large\nextent any improvement in their position and in the number\npermitted to emigrate has come about as a result of Western\npressure combined with the Soviet need for trade and access\nfor Western technology. The opportunities that Western\npressure still have to make itself felt will be much less\nfrequent as long as relations between the West and the\nUSSR deteriorate. Ominiously, the emigration figures for\nJanuary 1980 have already shown a drop as compared to the\nlast months of 1979.\nThe outlook for Soviet Jewry in 1980 is bleak. A harder\nattitude towards the community is likely to be reflected in\nmore an it semitism in the (state-controlled) media, the\ngranting of fewer exist visas and in increased repression of\nthe activists in the Jewish emigration and cultural movement.\nIn the centre pages of this issue of FELIX, you will find a petition on behalf of Imperial College Students' Union to be\ndelivered to the Soviet Embassy on Wednesday 19th March\nby Chris Fox, Union President. We are asking you to add\nyour signature to this petition and send it via the internal mail\nto Imperial College Jewish Society. (Just fold it as directed \u2014\nthe address is on the back!) Please try to fill the petitions\nrather than sending individual signatures, though these, too\nwill be welcome.\nOn the opening day of the Moscow Olympic Games (19th July 1980) an advertisement is to appear in The Times\ncarrying the names of students and their supporters in the\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland who wish to express their\ndisapproval of the inhumane treatment of Soviet Jewish\nstudents. For a contribution of \u00a31, your name will be included\nbelow the following statement:\n\"Today, the start of the Olympic Games in\nMoscow, we the students of the United Kingdom\nand Ireland, and our supporters, deplore the\ndiscrimination, harassment and imprisonment of our\nJewish colleagues in the Soviet Union.\"\nCHRIS FOX adds:\n\"For over two years now, ICU has taken a special\ninterest in a Soviet Jew who has been enduring\nmany problems within Russia. At a time when most\n. of the world will be focusing its eyes on Moscow, it\nis essential that a true perspective of the Soviet\nregime is maintained, and I urge you to sign the\npetitions.\"\nDuring next Tuesday lunchtime, we will be waiting to\nreceive your signature for both the ICU petition and the\nTimes advertisement in the JCR, .Sherfield Building.\nIf your accommodation doesn't have adequate facilities for\ndoing your own laundry, some offices can be prevailed upon\nto give you an extra 60p per week so that you can go to the\nlaunder et te. If you are a householder, ie responsible for such things as\npaying standing charges on electricity meters or responsible\nfor other household expenses it is worth pointing this out at\nyour interview as you should then get \u00a33.65 per week more\nthan the basic rate. Likewise, if you are a flat-share r and split\nthese responsibilities you should be able to get an addition of\n\u00a33.65 divided by the number of share rs. If you claim benefit in your home town for rent on\naccommodation in London you will only get \u00a32 per week (if\nyou are lucky). However, if you want to go home for part of\nthe vacation you can always ask for a holiday form which\nexcuses you from signing on in London. The chances of\ngetting one are pretty slim.\nSome people have lost their benefit by asking the DHSS to\nsend the money to their home address rather than to the\nplace for which they are claiming rent. *\nUnemployment Benefit\nThis is now harder to claim in most cases because they've\ngone and changed the rules. To claim now you have to have\nearned and payed National Insurance contributions on \u00a3750\nbetween April 1977 and April 1978 or \u00a3875 between April\n1978 and April 1979. If you claimed at Christmas for\nSupplementary Benefit or Unemployment Benefit at Easter.\nThis is because of what is known as the 'thirteen week rule'\nwhich states that if there is less than thirteen weeks between\n6\nTHE BOYFRIEND If you're searching for some-thing new in entertainment then the Cockpit Youth Theatre\nproduction of The Boyfriend is\nworth experiencing. The theatre\nin Marylebone is purpose built\nfor musicals with a cast of two\ndozen young people.\nAct one opens with the band\nplaying an overture which transfers us back to the twenties.\nThe production owes a lot to the\nyoung people who provided the\nmusical continuity which at times\ncould have been slightly softer so\nas not to drown the singers.\nThe girls who played the pupils\nat Madame Dubonnet's finishing\nschool set the standard of the\nproduction. Some were polished\ndancers while others were embarrassing to watch. With such a special theatre it is difficult\nto hide a weak dancer. Just\nputting them in the back row is\nnot enough.\nI make special mention of\nDany Allan who used the part of\nMai sie to hold the musical together. As soon as she spoke\nher first words she won the\naudience's respect. The high\nstandard of Dany's singing and dancing was so polished that I advise her to try to blend a little\nmore with the rest of the ensemble and to hold back until\nthe second act. Dany Allan\nCharlotte Cox also had vitality\nand I especially remember her\nnumber \"It's Nicer In Nice\" where she showed her talents as\na vivacious singer and dancer.\nThe role played by Twiggy in the\nfilm was taken by Cle a Wallis. I feel that she was miscast as Polly,\nbut she put up a brave show and\nif her duet with the delectable\nMadame Dubonnet in act three\nhad been deleted, then the production would have reached\na strong finale.\nIf you've read this far you may. wonder why the editor of FELIX has spent time seeing a musical\nthat, at first, seems a distance\nfrom Imperial. The reason is that\nmany students have bought tickets for The Boyfriend and there is still time to go and see it\nas it doesn't finish until the 22nd of March. If I may quote from a letter Dany sent to me: \"Could\nyou perhaps urge people from IC to come and see the production\nthis Saturday (15th March) as I expect that'll be one of the best\nnights; we'll have had time to get\nin the swing, and Saturday nights\nare always best!\"\nThere you have it... a leading\nmember of the cast recommends\nyou to come tomorrow night.\nStudent tickets just seventy pence from the Box Office (tele\n402-5081)\nColin Palmer\nthe end of your last claim and your previous claim, then they\nare treated as being the same claim and your entitlement\ndepends on your eligibility at the time of the first claim. By the same token, if you received Unemployment Benefit at\nChristmas, you should get it again at Easter.\nSquatting\nIf you fancy a change from paying extortionate rents to live\nwith a crotchety landlady, here is a chance to try some free\nand friendly, though possibly not too salubrious, low-living at\na secret location somewhere in London! The Tottenham Project organised by LSO is planning a large scale squat which will go into occupation on Saturday\n15th March. Hopefully it will be well organised and so as safe\nan introduction to this sometimes hazardous occupation as\none is likely to find.\nIf you are interested, assembly will be on Saturday 15th March at 11:00am at Kingsway Princeton College, Sidmouth\nStreet, Grays Inn Road, London W Cl. You will need a sleeping bag and enough clothes, etc to last you a week.\nFurther information from the Welfare Centre.\nSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT AND GENERAL ENQUIRY OFFICES\nCHELSEA, Waterford House, Wateford Rd.

With a scintillating\nmixture of current singles (both s cure and\nobscure), old things (Simon Milner?) and recent\nalbum music, this has to be the most wide-awake\nshow available on your tr an ny at that time of the\nmorning.\nSo show that you care and make a little girl very\nhappy by tuning-in any time between 8:00 and\n11:00, (i.e.7:0010:00??!). Thora Balast.\nWould you like to make this little girl very happy?\nPhoto by Jeremy Nunns\ni THE GREAT IMPERIAL RAG RACE: CHAPTER2! I am writing with reference to the Arsey\nEss propaganda that appeared in FELIX\nlast week entitled \" The Great Imperial\nRag Race\". I think it is desirable to warn\nthe perpetrators of this diabolical injustice'\nthat though they are undeniably bionic,\nnay superhuman, they are not Guildsmen.\nThose Guildsmen who were deemed fit\nfor the task and known as the Immortal Few\n(of \"Never before have so many been sold\nby so few\" and \"Last Rag Mag in Paris\"\nfame) were none less than those jolly bands\nof Chemical Engineers and the infamous\nBE1.\nWith all due modesty (ie none), I shall\nattempt to chronicle some of the feats of\nthese Guildsmen which far outshine the\nmiserable achievements of those specimens\nof humanity known as THEM THAT WHIMS( a nag) and HUG VEST IN\nCHEST( a nag). To begin with we have Jon \"Livingston I press ume\" Stanley who sold approximately\ntwo hundred and thirty mags and also did\nsome work the same weekend. Along\nwith that other triumph of our creator y imagination Frank Rowsell, he even\ndiscovered half of the famous Bristol\nUnion Long Bar.\nTwo other stalwarts of ingenuity, Tony\nHeales and Chris Spotty Davies, both of\nBE1, surely merit mention for putting\nduty before their own peso nal safety by\nventuring into a decrepit specimen of a Ford and proceeding at high speed\nthrough central London under the\nincapable control of Ian Cry or( ten\nprevious convictions). Further evidence of\nthis dedication to duty and sense of fair\nplay is born witness by the fact that Tony\npersisted in selling Rag Mags rather than\nhis body whilst at a Barts Hospital Nurses\nDisco!\nLast but not least we have the saga of\nthe \"nameless Guilds man\" who shall\nremain nameless. Travelling under the\npseudonym of Deviant (I do it my way)\nthis hero of modern times travelled over\neight hundred miles that weekend with \u00a37\nin his pocket and the public's sympathy\nfor his transport. Deviant eventually\nescaped from the initial RCS cock everything-up at 2:30pm and was coerced\ninto accepting a lift to Knutsford services.\nAfter indulging in deep fried eggs and\nchips he reached Fortran services from\nwhence a capitalist whisked our unfortunate\nlad to Edinburgh. Our hero listened to the\ntales of Rolls'Royces and twenty-nine\nnightclubs and nine firms which the man\nowned whilst resisting the vice of envy.\nAfter hitting a brick at 70mph on the A74\nwhich wrecked a wheel, Deviant arrived\nin Edinburgh at 12:30am. He was told\n\"the Forth Road Bridge is that way\" and\nstarted walking. Five hours later having\nwalked fifteen miles and been molested\ntwice by smokey bears, he ariv ed at the\nbridge.\nCold, tired and hungry, he got a lift\nwith an unintelligible Scot who deposited\nhim on a roundabout which was nowhere\nexcept vertically above the M90. An hour\npassed and Deviant was taken by a tarmac van to nowhere else from where\nhe got a bus to Perth. He obtained proof\nof purchase and attempted to hitch to\nEdinburgh, but Scottish generosity prevailed and he had to catch the train.\nFrom Edinburgh Deviant was taken, as\nif by magic to Leeds, sharing the back\nseat with two Yorkshire lasses. He was\nrested and watered at a Tetleys pub\nbefore being put on a bus to Leeds city\ncentre. Deviant paid his fare, sat down\nand fell asleep. He woke up an equal\ndistance the other side of Leeds and\ndecided to try again. Eventually he found\nrefuge and went to sleep. The next day\nhe sold Rag mags for four hours then got\na lift to Watford Gap. The poor innocent\nlad had just stepped from this car when\nhe was carried off into the bowels of an\nAudi by an aging lady doctor who brought him to Princes Gardens, this is\nknown as door to door service.\nIt gives me great pleasure, sir, to\nremain your most honourable and obedient servant. The Anonymous Guilds man, otherwise known as DOG A IN NOSH of BE1. Thanks to YES VET THEM LEN of EEl for the anagrams.\n\n"

    "content": "TOSSING THE CARPET C ABER PAT LEGGE TT GUILDS\nLast Saturday saw fifty deaf children,\ntogether with their parents and teachers,\ndescending on Princes Gardens for the\nC aber Tossing Event. After a slightly chaotic beginning, when it started to rain\njust as everyone was arriving, we managed to transfer to Southside Senior\nDining Room and thus keep fairly dry. While the kids ran underneath, we\nhad a short presentation ceremony, giving\nan auditory training unit to two deaf\nbrothers, Adam and Benjamin Pike, aged\nseven and four. These boys were mentioned\nin the TV Times last week, and we're hoping\nfor a follow-up story, so watch for it about\nthe beginning of April. I was then presented\nwith a certificate from the National Deaf\nChildrens Society for\" outstanding contributions to the welfare, development\nand happiness of deaf children\" so everyone\nwho's ever done anything for Rag take note\n\u2014 you are appreciated.\nThis Tuesday saw the Guilds Election\nU GM in ME220 with about five hundred\npeople there, making it the best attended\nU GM this year. There was an EG M immediately before the meeting at which\nthe second reading of the constitutional\nchanges took place, they were passed\nand consequently the elections took place\nusing a different system to that used before. The voting this time was by paper\nballot with stand-downs only in the top three posts. The results were:\nPresident: Pat Leggett\nVice President: Ruth Hildebrand\nHonorary Secretary: Sara McGuiness Honorary Junior Treasurer: Frank Rowsell\nEntertainments Chairman: Simon Shaw\nAcademic Affairs Officer: John Murphy Old Central ian s Representative: Mary Morrison\nPublicity Officer: Andy Dixon PRESIDENT\nCongratulations to all those who won and commiserations to those who didn't succeed. The celebrations afterwards followed their usual form with the new Exec being thrown into the pool closely\nfollowed by the old Exec who by now were getting used to water. The customary\ndrinks in the Queens followed with the\nPresident elect's round costing quite a bit.\nLunch in Strikes was unfortunately missed when''the waiter decided he was\nnot amused by Pat eating all the relish\nbefore being served with his hamburger.\nA change of venue followed with a mass\nexodus from Strikes. The celebrations in\nthe evening were conducted in the Loose\nBox near Harrods where many bottles of\nwine were drunk as were a few of the\npeople attending.\nThe afternoon continued with the c aber tossing, which was superbly organised by two guests: Scottish c aber toss ers, complete with kilts and sporran s! After that\ncame lots of silly games and then tea, complete with sausages on sticks, jelly and ice cream.\nAll in all it was a great afternoon which everyone enjoyed, especially the children,\nwho as one happy parent said \"they're\nthrilled, they'll never forget it\". Also dozens\nof parents, teachers and officials of the\nND CS showered us with praise afterwards,\nboth for our fund-raising and the event itself.\nIn the words of their Chairman:\" Your students are absolutely wonderful!\"\nI agree, and I'd like to thank everyone who helped in any way, especially the 'new faces'\nthat turned up \u2014 I hope you'll continue to\ntake an interest.\nA special mention must go to Katy Tatchell for organising the food for such a multitude. I have n't got room to list\neveryone else, but thanks all the same,\nespecially for joining in the games and getting on so well with the kids. I hope\nmeeting them made your involvement as\nworthwhile for you as it did for me.\nSee you all at the RAG PARTY in the\nJ CR TONIGHT! RAE Forthcoming events are:\nFriday 14th March Guilds are going\nto the theatre to see Dario Fo's Accidental\nDeath Of An Anarchist at Wyndham s. There still might be some tickets remaining\nso come along to the Union Office today if\nyou want to come. We will be meeting at\n7:30pm in Stans, if you are coming.\nSunday 16th March Guilds goes East.\nThis is a mystery trip round the East End of\nLondon taking some interesting sights around the place. The costs will, be sub sidi sed by Guilds, but bring some money. Meet in the Union Office if you want\nto come along at 10:30 in the morning.\nCheers\nBryan\n3\n\n"
