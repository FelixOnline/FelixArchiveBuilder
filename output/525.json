    "content": "PHILLIPS TELLS AMERICAN STUDENTS TO STOP AID TO IRA\nAmerican students were told\nby National Union of Students\nPresident Trevor Phillips that they\nhave a duty to step in and stop\npeople from the United States\ndonating money to para-military\ngroups in Northern Ireland.\nMr Phillips told delegates to\nthe first national conference of the\nUnited States Student Association (USSA) which opened on\nSaturday August 11th that there is\nno immediate or direct role for the\nUnited States to play in solving\nthe problem of Northern Ireland\nwith money for guns or by holding\nill-informed debates in New York.\nThe 3.5 million strong USS A was formed last year after a merger between America's National Student Association and\nthe National Student lobby there.\nThe conference took place at\nthe Lincoln campus of the\nUniversity of Massachussets in\nAm hurst. A three person delegation from NUS have flown\nto the United States for the\nconference. It is the first time that\nthere has been any official links\nbetween British and American\nstudent leaders for over ten years.\nAccompanying Mr Phillips on\nthe trip are NUS Vice-President,\nPete Silkin and Stuart Appleton,\nthe manager of the Union's International Department. Before flying out of London,\nTrevor Phillips said that he hoped\nthe trip would result in closer links\nbetween officers of the two unions\non matters of common concern\nincluding student grants, youth\nunemployment and Southern\nAfrica.\nHe said he would be inviting\nthe USS A to send a delegate to the\nnext NUS national conference to\nbe held in Blackpool in December.\nMr Phillips said he wants the\nUSS A and NUS to initiate a joint\ncampaign on Southern Africa\nnext spring. This will hopefully\ninclude campaigns in colleges for\nd is investment from firms with\ninterests in South Africa, the\ncollection of material aid such as\neducational and medical supplies\nfor liberation movements and pressing for an end to NATO cooperation with countries practising apartheid.\nWhilst we welcome Mrs Thatcher' s turnabout on Zimbabwe, NUS has a duty to\nkeep her on course and the USS A should keep the American Senate\nin check.\n\"Both Unions must ensure that\nsanctions are not lifted until there\nis a settlement which puts power\nin the hands of the people\", said\nMr Phillips.\nOn Northern Ireland he\ncommented:\" American politicians should look to sorting\ntheir own problems out. More\npeople die violently each day in\nNew York than in Northern\nIreland.\"\nMr Phillips commenting on the\nUSS A conference said: \"The\nUSS A is the biggest student union\nin the western world and NUS is\nthe best organised and best\ndeveloped union in Europe, so we\nhave much to learn from each\nother.\"\nHome Office\nHM PRISON Parkhurst Road Holloway\nTelephone 0 1 - 6 0 7 - 6 7 4 7\nThis special Edition\nof FELIX has been\nprinted because there\nis a likely hood that a court order may be\nserved which could\nstop FELIX being\nproduced.\nThe next FELIX was\nscheduled for Friday\nSeptember 14th. We\nstill hope to produce\nan issue of FELIX on\nthat date.\nDear Sirs, -1 am writing to you in the\nhope that you might be able to help\nus. We have searched in vain for part\ntime teachers of science and\nmathematics and we are wondering\nif any post-graduate students might\nbe interested in earning some extra\nmoney. The level of work is 'O' and\nbelow, often very much below. We\nneed teachers who can express\nscientific ideas simply.\nIdeally we need people for basic\nscience on Monday mornings, for\nbiology on Wednesday mornings\nand for mathematics on Thursday\nmornings. The optimum would be\nfor one person to cover all three but\nthis is not essential.\nTeaching conditions are less than\nideal, we would not expect anyone\nto take the job without due\nconsideration and of course we\nwould need to interview any\ncandidates to assess their suitability\nfor our conditions. Anyone who is\ninterested could ring me on\nextension 264 to arrange an\ninterview. The pay, by the way, for a two hour session is of the order of\n\u00a310.\nI look forward to hearing from\nyou.\nYours faithfully,\nR.M. Brown\nEducation Officer\n2\n\n"

    "content": "NEIL YOUNG - RUST NEVER SLEEPS (Reprise)\n\"My, My, Hey, Hey I Rock n' Roll Is here to stay, It's better to\nburn out I Than to fade away.\nThat's as maybe but on this\nshowing Neil Young doesn't intend to do either. After many\nyears of flirting with excellence,\nhe has come up with a masterpiece, his finest work ever.\n'Rust Never Sleeps', not to be\nconfused with the imminent\nmovie soundtrack to 'Human\nHighway' which apparently goes\nunder the same name, doesn't have a weak link. Previously\ndeficiencies always crept in; even\nthe legendary 'Zuma' album had\nsome deadweight. But now\nrecovering from 'Comes A Time',\nthe most recent album, which\nfound him deep in a rut. Young\nassembles the finest songs he's written in recent times into a class is set. One side is acoustic\nYoung - mostly solo, but with\nsome assistance on 'Sail Away'and one side of electric Young,\nwith crazy horse, his backing\nband for the last ten years.\nThroughout there is a 'live' feel\nwith both the opener 'My, My,\nHey, Hey (Out Of The Blue)' and\nthe closing 'Hey, Hey, My, My( Into The Black) - yes, they're the\nones with the Johnny Rotten\nreference - obviously concert\nmaterial.\nThe acoustic 'My, My ' sets\nthe tone of side one with it's thoughtful melancholic lyrics and\nYoung's alluring guitar work\nleading the way. It's a bitter song:\n\"It's out of the blue and into the\nblack / They give you this, but you\npay for that / And once you're\ngone you can never come back /\nWhen you're out of the blue and\ninto the black.\" A wonderful tale of\nthe rock n' roll lifestyle which after\nradical changes reappears to\nclose side two.\n'Thrasher', a song of the old\nways being swallowed up by the\nnew, builds slowly, Young's voice\nfull of emotion and su pressed anger. \"When the aimless blade of\nscience slashed the pearly gates /\nIt was then I knew I'd had enough,\nburned my credit card for fuel / ..\nWith one-way ticket to the land of\ntruth and my suitcase in my hand /\nHow I lost my friends I still don't understand.\"\n'Pocahontas', the first track on\nside two, is about the at tro cities suffered by the Red Indians in the\nfrontier days. \"They killed us in\nour tepee / And they cut our\nwomen dow.n/ They might have\nleft some babies / Crying on the\nground.\" It's sad but not\nsentimental, tender but not\nem baras sing. The electric, electrifying,\nuptempo side 2 features 4 of the\nmost riveting rock tracks I 've\nheard. 'Powderfinger' has Young\nplaying a youthful backwoods\nboy facing a gang of cut-throat\nrapists sailing up the river to\npillage the isolated settlers. He is\nalone and \"just turned twenty-two.\" A man does what a man has\nto do and dies in the process. It's so real it makes the Eagles look\nlike complete amateurs. The music on this side is the\ndriving force, the lyrics are cream\non the cake. The rock rhythms go\nthis way and that, howling chords\nand staccato guitar work that\ndefies belief. 'Welfare Mothers' My\ncurrent favourite, \"make better\nlovers\", sings Young, adding a solo that is truly beautiful. But no\nlet up and straight into 'Sedan\nDelivery', the riffs of which power\ntowards a stunning climax and\ninto 'Hey, Hey, My, My (Into the\nblack), almost un recognisable as\nthe opening tune. It's Young\nestablishing himself as the Kingof\nRock n' Roll. \"It's better to burn\nout cause rust never sleeps / The\nking is gone but he's not\nforgotten.\"\nThis album is perceptive,\nmelancholic, realistic, dynamic\nand should be at the top of any\nshopping list. Buy it and benefit.\nJon Firth\nA film review of\nIt was so far fetched that even\nan Acting FELIX Editor's imagination could not rival its\nincredible imagery.\nPhantasm was fun to watch\nbut not brilliant. Its trial release\nin East Anglia points to good\nbox office receipts when it is\nshown at the Eros, Piccadilly\n(starting on September 13th). Album Review\n\"The London Concert\"\nby Dave J ago One of the reasons that Oscar\nPeterson's playing has never\nparticularly appealed to me is that\nhe seems to play with a complete\nlack of emotion. The impression\nhas been fueled by watching him\nplaying happily away to an\nenthusiastic audience in the\nsafety and comfort of his own\ntelevision chat show. It is a well\nknown fact, amongst we traditionalists at least, that the\nbest jazz can only be played by\npenny less, homeless, unloved\n('My baby done left me ...') down\nand outs, preferably on the verge\nof catching pneumonia or going\ninsane. On this double album,\nhowever, recorded live at the\nRoyal Festival Hall last year,\nPeterson quite ex cells himself,\nplaying with a surprising fire and\npassion\nHaving said that, perhaps I had\nbetter make it clear that this is not\njust a record of Oscar Peterson\naccompanied by bass and drums,\nbut of a trio in the proper sense of\nthe word. All three instruments\ntake an equally important part in\nthe proceedings. Louis Bellson,\non drums, is known to many\nthrough his work with big bands,\nalthough he is in fact no stranger\nto small group playing. His\ndrumming is always well considered, and his short solo\nspots manage to be totally\nstunning, whilst remaining fully\nintegrated within the musical\ncontext. The drum choruses in\n'Sweet Georgia Brown' have to be\nheard to be believed - no boring\nextended ego trips here!\nJohn Heard, on bass, produces\na much grittier, and to my mind\nbetter, tone than does Nick\nPeterson, who is Petersons\nregular bass player. Heard's bouncy, angular style matches\nthe flu an cy of the piano lines\nbeautifully. Peterson himself, of\ncourse, plays with sheer technical\ngenius. The rendition of 'Sweet\nGeorgia Brown,' one of the standout tracks on the album, is\nnothing short of incredible, and\nthe ease with which he changes\nfrom style to style, bouncing from\nstride into bebop in the space of a few seconds, is sometimes breathtaking.\nAs to choice of material, we are\npresented with a wide selection.\nThe album combines standards\nsuch as 'Ain't Misbehavin' ' and\n'Satin Doll' with songs heard less\noften in a jazz setting. 'Falling in\nLove with Love' is an example of\nan often overlooked number\nwhich suits the jazz idiom\nbeautifully. With the addition of\nFats Waller's 'Jitterbug Waltz' and\na real live 12 bar, Oscar's own\n'Hogtown blues', there is fun for\nall the family. A couple of bal lands\nare included, 'I get Along Without\nYou Very Well' and 'Emily'. I found\nthem far too protracted and\nrambling, but there are people\nwho like such things. The other\ntrack I disliked was the Duke of\nEllington Medley, which just\nsounds disjointed, and really\nserves no purpose. The track that I would single out as being quite\nexcellent are 'Sweet Georgia\nBrown,'' Jitterbug Waltz', 'Hogtown Blues', and 'Pennies\nFrom Heaven', despite the totally\nunnecessary, rambling solo piano\nintro of the sort that Peterson\nseems to favour.\nThe quality of the sound is\nrather good for a live album, as\none would expect from the RF H Audience noise is kept to a minimum, and the bass in\nparticular is mixed very clearly. A slight hiss is clearly audible on the\nquiet section - hopefully this will\nnot be carried over onto the\nproduction copies.\nThis record should please both\nestablished Peterson fans and the\ngeneral listening public alike, and\nmay well win over a few like me\nA \u00abwho, till now, have been a bit wary\nof this man's prodigal talent on the\ngrounds that he uses it with too\nlittle expression.\n6\n\n"

    "content": "/ don't like Mondays by Mark smith To coincide neatly with this odd\npublication date, I 've scrapped together a montage of the current film releases(misleading titles can, of course, lie\nignored).\nFrom Thursday at the Gate, Notting Hill, you can sample Woody Allen's latest offering\nManhatten. Filmed in black and white and\nstarring Allen and Diane Keaton(again), it is\nanother attempt to draw on personal\nrelationships lor humour. It succeeds\nadmirably, with Woody Allen stealing the\nlimelight in his role as a middle aged Jewish\nNew-Yorker, involved not only with a17 year old girl but also with his friend's mistress. I found it as funny as any other Allen comedy(this is not Interiors!), but it could be\nconsidered a monochrome extension to\nAnnie Hall. This is not a disadvantage. A film\nnot to be missed.\nAlso doing well at the moment is Zeffirclli s The Champ. This is the tale of a former\nchampion boxer (John Voight) who attempts\nto make a comeback lor the sake of his young\nson (Ricky Schroder). The third player in this\nlarger than life drama is Faye Dunaway who\nplays the estranged mother who gave up her\nson to become a fashion designer. Through a series of bleary eyed break-ups and reunions a fairly interesting story is expanded, but I'd give this one a miss unless you have a weepy\ngirl/boyfriend and a good supply of tissues.\nCurrently London's biggest money spinner\nis the new Bond thriller Moonraker. A mixture of spy story, exotic locations and gadgetry, it sticks closely to the long\nestablished Bond formula. I consider it a blend ol most of the recent films, with the reappearance of \" Jaws\"( Richard Kiel) further\nenforcing this opinion. The gags are just as\ncorny as ever and the gadgets standard, but a gondola turning into a motor boat and then a hovercraft is too much! The orbital scenes\ninvolving the space shuttle are fascinating,\nbut expect no more than from the other 007\nstories translated (and usually transmuted)\nonto celluloid.\nThe inevitable battle, this time in a space station\nHugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) in MOONRAKER\nJohn Voight and Faye Dunaway in'T/ ie Champ\"\n\u2022Finally, as this is the last Felix before it's release date, I would like to mention a film\nyou will be hearing a lot more about soon.\nALIEN( X, Ridley Scott) is an extremely\nenjoyable sci-fi story with a difference. In an\nattempt to draw as large an audience as\npossible, Scott has cleverly produced a mixture of genres. The haunted house image\nis combined with space hardware as the crew\nof the tug \" Nost romo\" pursue an incredible\nalien being in their huge spacecraft. The outstanding feature of this movie in\nparticular is the superb artwork invoked: artists include H.R. Gig cr, designer of the\nalien itself, Ron Cobb, Chris Foss and Jean\n\" Moebius\" Giraud( Heavy Metal). With such talent involved I expected a great deal\nand was not disappointed.\nThe plot is basically high tension from\nbegg in ing to end, which may be a fault, but I enjoyed it enormously. Despite a lew\nscientific inaccuracies (which I did'nt notice\nat the time) the interiors are better than 2001,\nno mean feat, and with some superb filming\nan air of menace is constantly achieved. Go and see it without any knowledge of the plot\nand you will be surprised and shocked; get\nthe info from your best pal and spoil the story\nand you're a fool!\n5\n\n"

    "content": "Romeo and Juliet\nat the Old Vic\nThis is a new production of\nRomeo and Juliet performed by\nthe newly formed Old Vic Company. All new ventures have\nteething problems and this is no\nexception. The performance lacked a certain degree of\nprofessionalism to lift it above a play you watch and forget. To\nstart with, we were sitting at the\nfront and so were disturbed by\nseeing the cast and stagehands\nbehind the scenery and by noise\nof shifting props.\nThe beginning was bad - there\nis no other word for it! We sat\nmunching our fruit pastels as the\ncurtain rose but were rather\nconfused when the house lights\nremained on. Tw o actors began to\nstroll around at the back of the set\nand seemed as bemused as we\nwere and to add to this muddled\nscene, the voice of the stage\nmanager could clearly be heard.\nThe set, too, was a little\nsurprising; it consisted of a moveable gantry and a pair of\ncurtains which were positioned\nnoisily for each scene and\nreminded us more of the setting\nfor Jailhouse Rock than the city\ncentre of Verona.\nThe play began with a fight and\nthis was indicative of the scenes to\nfollow; noisy and fast. Indeed,\nspeed seemed to be one of the\nonly constant characteristics of\nthe play! However, there were\nsome redeeming features,in\nparticular Ian Richardson' s portrayal of Mercutio. He pi aye d the part with the maturity of a seasoned Shakespearean actor,\nbringing just the right amount of\nhumour to this tragedy. His death\nwas rather overacted but still\nfitted in with his character and the\nplay as a whole. Robert Putt, as\nPeter, and Barbara Jefford, as\nJuliet's nurse, also acted their\nparts well and merit a special\nmention.\nOne would have expected the\nlovers, Michael Thomas and Janet\nMaw, to have been \"starry-eyed\"\nbut these two young players\nseemed unable to give the\nperformance required of them in\nsuch a part and this, above all,\ndetracted from the play. Janet\nMaw looked the part and gave all\nshe had in it but somehow she\nlacked the necessary passion and\nMichael Thomas the same problem.\nScene rushed after scene\n(were they trying to finish before\nlast orders or were they worried\nabout the tube strike?) until the\nlights went down after the great\nCapulet/ Montague re conciliation leaving the cup of\npoison oscillating back and forth\non the stage.\nI think the faults were in the\nproduction rather than the acting\nand the poor beginning (including\nnot being allowed to enter the\nauditorium until 20 past 7) put the\naudience off.\nHowever, the performance\nshould mature over the next few\nnights and it is a good evening's entertainment.\nMo and Tansy\nTales of the Unexpected - Frank\nMarino & Mahogany Rush (CBS)\nIf you imagine Deep Purple\nwith Candian accents and without\nthe mastery of Jon Lord on\nkeyboards, then you have quite a close approximation to Maho gny Rush. The music on this\nalbum relies very heavily on\nrep t it ion of bass chord sequences;, with very slight\nvariations introduced at\napproximately half minute intervals.\n'Tales of the Uneaxpected' is\nhalf live and half recorded in the\nstudio, and although the bands\nre put it ion has been built on its live\nperformances around Canada and the U.S., the studio side of\nt he album is far stronger than the\nLive side. But it is easy to imagine\nthat the music would sound better\nplayed about ten times louder\nthan it need be in a sweaty and\nsmokey concert hall.\nThe musicianship on this L.P. is very good in parts - mostly the\nparts played by Frank Marino\nhimself, who plays lead guitar\nalmost like it was part of his body,\nand his synthesizer playing is\ncompetent. However if the other\ntwo members of the band, Paul\nHarwood on bass and James\nAyoubi, drummer, have half the\ntalent of Marino they don't like to\nshow it, as their part in the music\nis just keeping a steady but basic\nback-beat for the lead guitar to\noutshine. But then this might be\nthe fault of Mr Marino in the\nwriting, since he has written six\nout of the eight tracks on the\nalbum.\nSadly, the two tracks most\nworthy of further scrutiny are the\ntwo cover versions on the studio\nside. The first being Dylan's 'All\nAlong the Watchtower'. You remember Jimi Hendrix' s version? Well this in the same vein\nbut, predictably, not so good; and\nif covering one of Hendrix\ngreatest is inviting criticism the\nnext song on the record is\n'Norwegian Wood' by Lennon and\nMcCartney, this is performed in a very different way to the original\nand possibly better than the\nBeatles version, with the exception of the vocals. Definitly\nMaghogony Rush's version is\nmore inter resting and has more\ncontent than that of the Beatles.\nThe best original song in this\nset is the title track, which\ncontains more variation than any\nof the others, with some very nifty\nguitar work a fast beat but enough\nchange in lead instrument and\ntempo to keep the interest of the\nlistener, par hap s the only track on\nthe album capable of doing so.\nMahogany Rush have not\nmade much of an impression on\nBritish heavy rockers and I'm sure\nthat this is not the record to break\nthem over here. I should give this a miss.\nThe Undertones\n- The Undertones (Sire)\nI return from the sweaty mass\nof enthusiastic Marquee po goers with my ears still ringing. The\nUndertones 'live' definately have\nto been seen and heard to be\nbelieved. Of course good live\nperformers do not always fare well\non disc but two weeks later when I listen to this new album it sounds\njust as fresh and innovative. The\nUndertones have evolved from\npunk and, with admirable ease,\nnow play the best modern pop of\nthis age. If you think I' mex age rating check out this album.\nSure they have a few rough edges,\nsomething not quite right here or\nthere, but they're learning fast.\nDespite their naive appearance\nthey've got it pretty well sus sed out.\nHailing from Derry, Northern\nIreland, the 'tones sing vividly of\nthe insecurity, loneliness and\nyearning of adolescence. They\nmake their point with breathtaking economy; straight to the\nheart of the matter and after\nimparting their undoubted wisdom the song ends. It's as\nsimple as that; fourteen tracks in\njust half an hour and everyone a potential hit single. But it doesn't sound thrown together, it flows\nfrom one juicy observation to the\nnext. Youth is on their side - ages\nranging between 18 and 21 - and if\nthis is what the debut album turns\nup I can hardly wait for more.\nEach song - I could mention\nthem all - stands out except 'True\nConfessions' which received a raunchier treatment on the\n' Teenage Kicks' EP. the staggering rhythm guitar augmented by more detailed work\nfrom the lead guitarist serve as a foil to Fergal Sharkey's careering\nvocals. The songs are short,\npowerful, dance able and don't even have a chance to get boring. I could go on ad infinitum and still\nnot convince you but my message\nis this:- it's a good album, get it\nand enjoy yourself (or others)\nwith some of the best music\naround today.\nJon and Karen\nREVIEWS7 "
