These recent\nchanges have resulted\nin a transformation of\nthe fixed income market\nstructure, the process of\nprice discovery and the\nnature of liquidity provi-sion. Electronic trading\u2019s\nadvance and structural\nconsequences will have\nimplications for market\nquality and functioning\nthat are yet to be fully\nexplored. This article\nprovides a view of the\nrising use of electronic\nand automated trading in\nfixed income and related\nderivatives markets \u2013 a\nprocess we refer to as\n\u201celectronification\u201d.\nAlgorithmic trading\nis a process of buying or\nselling a security based on\nsome pre-defined set of\nrules which are backtested\non historical data. These\nrules can be based on\ntechnical analysis,\ncharts, indicators or even\nstock fundamentals. For\nexample, suppose you\nhave a trading plan that\nwould buy a particular\nstock if it closes in red\nfor 5 consecutive days.\nYou can formulate this\nrule into an algorithmic\ntrading system and\neven automate it so that\na buy order is placed\nautomatically when your\ncondition is met. You may\neven define your stop loss,\ntarget and position sizing\nin the algorithm which\nimpact on the structure\nof fixed income markets\nand the interplay of\nvarious participants in\nthe market ecosystem.\nElectronic trading has also\ncontributed to changes in\nmarket-making business\nmodels, a growing\npresence of firms\nemploying automated\ntrading, and greater\nweight being placed by\ninvestors on improving\nexecution.\nThe extent of\nelectronic trading in fixed\nincome markets varies\nsignificantly but has\nbeen growing over time\nglobally as shown in Fig.\n1 and Fig. 2.\nDespite the\nphenomenon\u2019s growing\nimportance, policymakers\ndirect access to continuous\nand comprehensive data\non electronic trading in\nfixed income markets is so\nfar limited. It also presents\nthe results of an ad hoc\nsurvey of over 30 platform\nproviders conducted by\nthe Markets Committee\nStudy Group. In some\nfixed income segments,\nelectronification is now\nnearly as developed as in\ncash equities and foreign\nexchange.\nIn some markets, an\nincrease in electronic\ntrading has been driven\ndirectly by technological\nimprovements that have\nfacilitated a reduction\nof the marginal cost of\nproviding intermediation\nservices and lowered\nthe barriers to entry\nfor companies with a\ntechnology advantage.\nElectronic trading is most\nadvanced in those markets\nin which assets are most\nstandardised and highly\nliquid \u2013 in particular,\nfutures and the inter-dealer on-the-run US\nTreasury market.\nIn conclusion, it is clear\nthat electronic trading in\nfixed income markets is\nadvancing and that this is\ncreating efficiencies for\nmany market participants,\nimproving transparency\nand reducing market\nsegmentation. It is\nimportant to note that the\nappropriate responses\nmay differ across\njurisdictions because of\nthe heterogeneous nature\nof fixed income markets as\nwellasthevaryingdegrees\nof \u201celectronification\u201d.\nFour core areas for\nfurther policy assessment\ninclude: data, disclosure\nand monitoring; market\nquality and stability; risks\nand risk management;\nand trading practices and\nregulation.\n\u201cYou may\neven define\nyour stop\nloss, target\nand position\nsizing in the\nalgorithm\nwhich would\nmake your\ntrading life\neasier.\u201c\nwould make your trading\nlife easier.\nAlgorithmic trading\nstrategies can be\nroughly grouped in\nthree categories: Trade\nExecution; Marketaking; and Directional,\nRelative Value and\nArbitrage Strategies.\nTrade Execution is when\nexecution algorithms are\noften concerned with\nminimising the price\nimpact of a transaction.\nMarket-making is to profit\nfrom the bid-ask spread,\nwhile ensuring tight risk\ncontrol over inventory\npositions and minimising\nthe risk of transacting with\nan informed counterparty.\nDirectional, Relative\nValue and Arbitrage\nStrategies are strategies\nthat attempt to exploit\nsystematic short-term\npatterns in asset prices\nor arbitrages; may also\nimplement strategies\nidentifying arbitrage\nopportunities in markets\nwith fragmented liquidity.\nTheimpactofelectronic\ntrading in fixed income\nmarkets and the resulting\nshift in various aspects\nof market structure have\nhad a noticeable impact\non market quality and its\noptimal measurement.\nElectronic trading is\nhaving a significant\nFigure 1: Growth in fixed income electronic trading on both investment grade bonds and high yield bonds // Bloomberg\nFigure 2: Growth of electronic in fixed income (bond) market // Financial Times\nElectronic and Algorithmic Trading: Fixed Income Securities\n\n"

Debby stands\nfor almost half an hour,\nstrapped to a spider\u2019s web\nwith a pig-masked guard\nalways by her side, a theatrical version of her days\nin the modern slavery sub-world.Abdulrahman spins\nin a hamster wheel, victim\nof an administrative bingo\ngame. Baraa is caught in\nthe pinball of finding all\nthe documentation needed\nto settle in a new country\nin 28 days, running\nagainst homelessness.\nMohand combines several\njobs with the dream of\nbecoming an actor.\nDespite the harshness\nof the stories, the tone\nis never self-pitying.\nOn the contrary, we are\ninvited to laugh at their\nmisadventures and in a\nway learn some shocking\nfacts about the regulations\nasylum seekers face that\nchallenge us to redefine\n\u201cgenerosity\u201d. There is\nan underlying feeling of\nresilience, as they know\nthat sharing their stories\nis a way to fight for\nbetter opportunities, to\nexpose their experiences\nto a blissfully ignorant\naudience and to give hope\nto others like them.\nThe show itself is\na lovely collection of\npersonal stories, humour\nand creative theatrical\ntricks.\nFrom the beginning, the\naudience is invited to send\ntheir dreams to the stage,\nin the form of balloons.\nLight-hearted pictures of\nmigrant\u2019s everyday life alternate with the plottings\nof a system devoted to\ncreating a \u201chostile environment\u201d. Witty parody\nsongs with hilariously\ncrafted lyrics are an essential part of the show, from\na cabaret describing how\nto cope with multiple jobs\nto a spoonful of missing\npaperwork. Brexit makes\nits appearance, prompting Europeans to join\nthe refugees in the \u201cone\nperson, one question\u201d race\nfor a passport. Beloved\nBritish characters, such\nas Mary Poppins, William\nShakespeare and one or\ntwo royals are also invited\nto the fun.\nHats off for some extraordinary performances,\nincluding a hilarious\ninterpretation of Romeo\nand Juliet in \u201cwho has the\nstrongest accent\u201d version,\nand the best stand-alone\nmoment of the whole\nshow, a parody of a Home\nOffice interview with\nintense witchcraft.\nAlmost as valuable\nas the show itself was\nthe Q&A session that\nfollowed. The audience\nhad the chance to get to\nknow the actors behind\nthe characters and to\nunderstand the creative\nprocess of the company.\nThere were lots of questions regarding the regulations mentioned during\nthe play, and many more\nabout how much of the\nstories were true. Turns\nout they all are, albeit\nembelished and satirized.\nAbdul shared the good\nnews: his wife obtained\na visa, so they will be\nreunited after four years\napart.\nWelcome to the UK fills\nthe stage with humour,\nhorror, live music and\ncandy floss, a satirical\nportrait of the UK, as\ndirector Sophie Besse\ndescribes it, \u201cwith a\nSudanese, Italian, Syrian,\nGambian, Iranian, Iraqi,\nAfghani, Zimbabwe,\nArmenian and French\ntouch\u201d.\nL\nondon has many\nmuseums, the\nV&A, Science\nMuseum, Natural\nHistory Museum and\neven some outside of\nSouth Kensington! One\nof these is the Museum\nof Comedy, located in\nBloomsbury. On the last\nSunday of every month\nfor the foreseeable future,\nthe small venue inside is\nseized by the \u201cHivemind\u201d\nimprov group for what\nthey promise to be a night\nof hilarity in a one of a\nkind fantasy tale.\nThe show, aptly named\nLord of the Game of\nthe Ring of Thrones,\napplies the classic art of\nimprov to a story from a\nfaraway land. Confining\nthemselves to this type of\nfantasy storytelling allows\nfor a framework which\nensures at least the semblance of a plot, usually an\nissue for improv shows.\nPresenting themselves\nas \u201ctravelling bards\u201d, the\nperformers ask the audiences what story, from the\nseemingly infinite stories,\nthey want. After a few\nawkward silences from\nthe audiences interrupted\nby some overzealous\nindividuals, the world and\nthe story are created.\nThe tale will take\nplace in the great land of\nDomtherea (named after\nDom, the first audience\nmembers pipe up with a\nsuggestion). The capital\ncity of this legendary land\nis the city of Curloss,\nknown for big hair but\nsmall hats, as shouted\nout by one lady in the\nfront. Finally, an audience\nmember who probably\nhad a tough week described the land to the\neast as being known for\n\u201cpeople with the weight of\nexistential dread wedging\ndown on them\u201d and\n\u201ckittens\u201d. Finally the great\nupside down mountain,\ninhabited by horse sized\nducks, aptly named huck,\nwas introduced. The plot\nwas to be centred around\nan inhabitant or this very\nmountain: George, the\nsmallest of the horse sized\nducks.\nNow that the scene has\nbeen set, without even\na millisecond to discuss\nanything, it\u2019s time for the\nactors to come up with an\nhour long show. The key\nto an improv show is good\nchemistry, and Hivemind\ndefinitely ticked this box.\nThe group is made up of\nex-Cambridge students\nwho were part of the\nlegendary \u201cCambridge\nImpronauts\u201d. Today, they\nall seem to have top jobs\nin the city so are by no\nmeans improv professionals but the fact that\nthey have known each\nother and have trained\ntogether for years, means\nthey play off each other\nwith ease. There were\ndefinitely some moments\nof awkwardness but these\nwere usually played off\ncomedically by the actors.\nBeing part of and witnessing something being\ncreated right before your\neyes is something unique\nto improv. It\u2019s exciting.\nIf you want to laugh so\nmuch you\u2019re face starts\nto physically hurt while\nwatching a fun plot - that\nyou had a part in creating\n- unfold, this is definitely\nthe show for you!\nFantastically farcical // Hivemind\nMohand\u2019s big dreams // Jos\u00e9 Farinha\nISSUE 1712\nFELIX\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

I also can't\nshake the feeling that\npeople can't wait to get\nrid of my fellow Full\nTime Officers and me.\nThis wasn't helped by\na meeting we were in\non Wednesday in which\nwe were effectively\ntold that Union staff are\ngoing to be pricks to us\nfor the next six weeks as\nelection season hots up.\nOh joy...\nAnyway, this term's\nimproved performance\ncontinues as I'm writing\nthis editorial before 10pm.\nStill not quite hit the 7pm\ntarget but we move.

I encourage\nany postgraduate students\nreading this Editorial to\nsubmit content for the\nsection to ensure it is as\nengaging as possible. In\nparticular, I think the \"Su-pervision Stories\" series\nin particular provides an\nimportant forum for open\ndialogue about the crucial\nstudent - supervisor relationship and its associated\ndynamics.\nThisweek,Ialsohadthe\npleasure of interviewing\nEmma Tucker, the Deputy\nEditor of The Times.

I even\nwore pink (on Wednesdays, we wear pink), but\nI couldn't bring myself to\nactually set foot inside.\nMabe next time.\nI got my hands on a\ncopy of Warwick's student\nnewspaper, The Boar.

I can't\nreally be blamed though,\nnot much has happened\nthis week. In fact, I was\nreally scratching my\nhead to think of anything\nnoteworthy. I don't even\nknow why people read this\nfar. In fact, I've received\nmultiple compliments\nabout how \"open\" and\n\"heart-on-your-sleeve\"\nI am in these. Whatever\nfloats your boat, I guess...\nI'm flattered. If I could\nblush, trust me I would be\nbright red.\na clear message that we\nvalue excellence, rather\nthan just complain when\nsomething isn\u2019t great. By\nputting five minutes into\nsubmitting a nomination,\nyou can (anonymously)\ntell a staff member that,\ndespite all the ways in\nwhich they could improve,\nyou appreciate them and\nthe impact that they\u2019ve\nmade on you during your\ntime at Imperial. That you\nappreciated that one time\nthat they gave you some\nsolid advice, or that they\nare trialling innovative\nteaching methods even\nif it doesn\u2019t always work\nout. The SACAs make it\neasy and mean so much to\nstaff. See for yourself:\n\u201cI felt really honoured\nto be nominated. I take\ncare to deliver the best\nteaching I can and receiving a nomination from\nthe students makes a big\ndifference to the way I feel\nabout spending that extra\ntime.\u201d - Nominee\nthe biggest, most mean-ingful, and most gratifying awards of my career. It\nprovided me with tremendous motivation to strive\nto improve and modernise\nmy teaching further such\nthat it continues to be\nworthy of the world-class\nstudents that Imperial\nattracts. It also gave me\na lot of legitimacy, and\ncredibility, when providing input and feedback\nto other academics in\nterms of how to improve\ntheir teaching in order\nto maximise the students'\nlearning experience.\u201d \u2013\nWinner\nSo, what does this all\nhave to do with changing\nImperial? Well, every\nstaff member that gets\nnominated, whether it\u2019s\nby one or fifteen students,\nreceives a special mug\neven if they don\u2019t actually\nwin the award for that\ncategory. That mug is\nthen a daily reminder\nthat they are appreciated\nby students. So why\ndoes that matter? Let\u2019s\nbe stereotypical Imperial\nstudents and do some\n#quickmaths. Assume that\nreceiving a mug makes a\nstaff member feel 5, 10,\nmaybe 20% more confident in what they do. Now\nimagine 10 members of\nstaff in your department\nputting that little bit\nextra in. How about 20?\nWhat about 200 across a\nfaculty? What about the\n11 award winners feeling\nempowered to continue\nchampioning change?\nStudentsgaveoutover900\nmugs across Imperial last\nyear. That\u2019s 900 members\nof staff continuing to be\nmotivated to go the extra\nmile for YOU. Get the\npicture?\nThe bottom line is that\nevery nomination you\nsubmit sends the message\nthat students value\naren\u2019t missed. There\nare 11 categories to\nchoose from and you can\nnominate as many staff\nas you like. The more\nconvincing nominations a\nstaff member receives, the\nhigher chance they have\nof being shortlisted and\nwinning an award at the\nceremony in May, so get\nyour friends to nominate\ntoo!\nHead to imperialcolle-geunion.org/sacas to find\nout more.\nNot convinced?

Shine\nlight on the truth, report\naccurately.\nDo you have any\nadvice to aspiring\njournalists?\nMy advice to aspiring\njournalists is do jour-nalism. School, college,\nwherever it is that you\nare, try and get involved\nin whatever journalism\nis on offer and write. If\nyou can\u2019t get involved in\na local paper or a student\npublication, write a blog.\nJust get used to writing\nand show your commitment because it\u2019s a bit of\na vocation, journalism.\nYou\u2019ve got to really want\nto do it.\nWhat qualities would\nyousaymaketheideal\nstudent journalist?\nTenacity, a slight sense\nof mischief, curiosity and\na slight pig-headedness.\nYou\u2019ve got to be stubborn,\nyou\u2019ve got to keep going.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion\non the media\u2019s role in\nBrexit?\nI feel that it wasn\u2019t the\nmedia\u2019s finest hour. I think\nin many ways, we got to\nwhere we are because\nlarge parts of the British\nmedia didn\u2019t report the\nEuropean Union sufficiently correctly or even\nbroadly enough. It was\nreported in a very trite,\nfacile way and a lot of it\nwas seen through a filter\nas if we weren\u2019t part of\nit, as if it was somehow\nimposed on us and the\nend result was, I think, a\nlot of people were very\nill-informed about the\npart we played in it. With\nsome notable exceptions,\nnot all the press did that\nbut, by and large, it wasn\u2019t\ntreated seriously and I\nthink Brexit could partly\nbe blamed on that.\nWhat are your\nthoughts on\nremaining relevant in\nthe digital landscape\nand the future of print\nmedia?\nThe old legacy publishers have to embrace data\njournalism. You won\u2019t\nfind any serious newsrooms that don\u2019t have a\ndata team. It also opens\nup so many more possibilities for investigation,\nstories, analysis. A good\ndata team can supply half\nyour news list if they\u2019re\nreally on top of their game\nso I think it\u2019s an exciting\nnew branch of journalism.\nIn an increasingly\nglobalised world, how\ndo you decide which\nnews to focus on?\nThat\u2019s such a good\nquestion. I think people,\nby and large, want to read\nabout what they know\nso, obviously, we give\nmore priority to events\nthat happened in the UK.\nI think you have to accept\nthat you can\u2019t report\neverything and, more\noften than not, if you\u2019re\npicking out a foreign story,\nit\u2019s got wider relevance.\nObviously you\u2019re still\ngoing to report catastro-phes, events, accidents,\nearthquakes but, by and\nlarge, the sort of stories\nyou choose to report will\nbe because they\u2019ve got\nsome sort of relevance or\nbroader point to make.\n\n"

Failure was\nnot getting the requisite\ngrades at A-levels. We\nwere writing and constantly reworking essays\nfor American colleges to\nmake ourselves sound\ninteresting, outstanding. I\nwas torn between what a\nfuture career should look\nlike, and what I desperately wanted to do.\nThis period of time,\nalthough so distant and so\ninconsequential now, felt\ntumultuous then. It was a\ntime when we were trying\nto give our nascent, till\nthen constantly-evolving\nidentities, some shape.\nIt was during this period\nof uncertainty that a friend\nslipped \u2018Wild Geese\u2019 into\none of my notebooks, and\nthus introduced me to\nMary Oliver. \u201cYou do not\nhave to be good\u201d, read the\nopening line. \u201cYou only\nhave to let the soft animal\nof your body / love what\nit loves.\u201d While I was\ncaught in the decisions of\nmy small life, the poem\nreminded me that \u201cmeanwhile the world goes on\u201d,\nlike the wild geese that are\n\u201cTo speak to\npeople of all\nwalks of life is,\nI feel, a marker\nof poetic\nsuccess.\u201d\nheading home again, like\nany other day.\nWhile the poem certainly didn\u2019t save me from\na burning building, it\nwent some way to saving\nsome part of my soul. It\nreminded me that there\nwere larger things in life,\nthat expectations were\nexternally imposed after\nall. It reminded me to look\nto nature and wonder at its\nvastness and my place in\nit. \u201cWhoever you are, no\nmatter how lonely, / the\nword offers itself to your\nimagination\u201d, and no one\ncan take this connection\nfrom you.\nAs I discovered more\nof Oliver\u2019s poems, I\nrealised that this was the\nbeauty of her words \u2013 to\nevoke nature so simply\nand deftly, and relate it\nto personal struggles.\nOliver\u2019s poetry is rooted\nin the Romantic nature\ntradition, and reminds one\nof Emerson\u2019s essays and\nthe poetry of Whitman\nand Wordsworth. She\nwrites of vast painterly\nlandscapes \u2013 the sky, the\nsea, the rivers \u2013 but also\ncelebrates the smaller\ndetail of nature. \u201cHow\ngreat was its energy, /\nhow humble its effort\u201d,\nshe writes in \u2018Song of the\nBuilders\u2019, contemplating\nthe efforts of a cricket\nmoving the \u201cgrains of the\nhillside\u201d, then relating to\n\u201ceach of us going on / in\nour inexplicable ways /\nbuilding the universe.\u201d\nRather than ostentatious displays of natural\nbeauty, Oliver chooses to\nfocus on quiet, unassuming images of nature. In\ncapturing these so perfect-ly, her poems encourage a\nconstant sense of wonder\nand appreciation of the\nbeauty all around us. As\nshe describes in \u2018When\nDeath Comes\u2019, \u201cWhen\nit\u2019s over, I want to say\nall my life / I was a bride\nmarried to amazement\n./ I was the bridegroom,\ntaking the world into\nmy arms.\u201d Indeed, if her\npoems are any indication,\nshe has certainly lived her\nlife amazed at the world,\nhumbled by its beauty.\nWhile Mary Oliver is\none of America\u2019s best-loved poets, she had often\nnot been taken seriously\nby poetry critics in her\nlifetime.Noneofherbooks\nreceived a full-length\nreview in The New York\nTimes, and in its review\nof a magazine in which\nOliver was interviewed,\nDavid Orr laughed at the\nidea of poetry as self-help,\nrevealing the general\ncontempt of poetry that\nmeets popular culture.\nOliver was by no means\nunrecognised, though \u2013\nshe won the Pulitzer Prize\nin 1984 for her fifth poetry\ncollection American\nPrimitive and New and\nSelected Poems won the\nNational Book Award in\n1992.\nIn fact, it is precisely\nthe accessible nature of\nher work that makes her\nsuch an important poet.\nA few of her books have\nappeared on bestseller\nlists; Gwyneth Paltrow\nreads her, and Cheryl\nStrayed used her poem\n\u2018The Summer Day\u2019 as an\nepigraph to her memoir\nWild: \u201cTell me, what is it\nyou want to do / with your\none wild and precious\nlife?\u201d\nTo speak to people of\nall walks of life is, I feel, a\nmarker of poetic success.\nHer poems are in blank\nverse, easily understandable but by no means basic\nin its construction. The\nimages are deftly woven\ntogether, the cadence of\nher words bring out these\nimages. To reveal the\nsimple beauty of mundane\nimages is her forte. To\ninspire personal responses\nwith these images is her\ngenius.\nMary Oliver (1935-2019) // Rachel Giese Brown\nWild Geese\nMary Oliver\nYou do not have to be good.\nYou do not have to walk on your knees\nfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.\nYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves.\nTell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\nMeanwhile the world goes on.\nMeanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain\nare moving across the landscapes,\nover the prairies and the deep trees,\nthe mountains and the rivers.\nMeanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,\nare heading home again.\nWhoever you are, no matter how lonely,\nthe world offers itself to your imagination,\ncalls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -over and over announcing your place\nin the family of things.\n\n"

The Second\nweek of February will be Green Week 2019, in which there will be more events than usual. There are also additional events that are still in the planning stage, so\nbe sure to follow the societies on their Facebook page, just search:\nESoc \u2013 Imperial College Environmental Society\nVegSoc \u2013 Imperial VegSoc\nAPES \u2013 Imperial College APES: Animal Protection and Education Society\nBook Review: Green Giants\nA\nlthough \u2018sust a i n a b i l i t y \u2019\nis a constant\nbuzzword in\nour society and people\nseem to understand that\nits somewhat important, I\nfeel that many of us don\u2019t\nknow what it really means\nto be sustainable. Should\nwe stop using plastic all\ntogether? Should we abandon eating all meat and\ndairy? Should we never\npurchase fast fashion ever\nagain? How can we, as a\nsociety become more environmentally conscious?\nMaking these incremental\nchanges as individuals\nwill undoubtedly add up,\nbut sometimes it can feel\nlike it will take months,\nyears, or even decades\nuntil we see noticeable\nimpacts. But in Green\nGiants, Williams explores\nthe ways in which some\nof the biggest companies in the world have\nmanaged to implement\nsustainability into their\nbusiness plan to tackle\nenvironmental issues at\nits core and enable our\nsociety to take large\nstrides forward. Natura,\nChipotle, Toyota (Prius),\nTesla Motors, IKEA,\nWhole Foods, Unilever,\nGE (Ecomagination) and\nNike (Flyknit) are the 9\n\u2018Green Giants\u2019 that are\nmentioned in this book.\nThey are the pioneers of\nthe inexorable green business revolution. What is\ntruly incredible is that the\nannual revenue of these\ncompanies together represents over $100 billion\ndollars, showing us that\nwith the right strategy and\nvision, companies have\nthe potential to transform\nsocietal needs into business opportunities.\nAs a reader passionate\nabout sustainability, but\nnot so aware of business\nmanagement, this book\nmade me realize just\nhow powerful companies\ncan be, in contributing\nto solve the greatest\nchallenges of our gen-eration. The book starts\noff with stories about the\nindividual leaders of these\ncompanies that started it\nall and proceeds to go into\ndetails about what it takes\nto lead businesses that can\nsucceed in the long term\n- not just economically\nbut also environmentally.\nAlthough my previous\nimpressions about \u2018green\nbusinesses\u2019 was that\nbeing environmentally\nsustainable often came at\nthe expense of corporate\nsuccess, reading about\nthese companies proved\nto me just how vital and\npossible it is, for sustainability to become deeply\nintegrated into business,\nwhere it has the potential\nto influence society on a\nmuch larger scale than we\ncan imagine. By tackling\nenvironmental problems\non both a societal and\nindividual level, we can\nall aspire to build a more\nsustainable economy. I\nwould highly recommend\nthis to anyone interested\nin business management\nor sustainability.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMonami Miyamoto\nSustainability Editor\nFRIENDs for life\nU\nUpon arrival\nto FRIEND\nanimal sanc-tuary, we\nwere greeted by the loud\nclucks of chickens and\nthe turning heads of cows.\nWe made our way through\nthe muddy terrain to an\nopen field, where we were\nwelcomed by Dave, who\nwas a full-time volunteer\nat the sanctuary. Behind\nhim followed Ging whose\npuppy eyes gleamed with\nexcitement at the sight of\na big group of visitors.\nThe early start did not\nseem to have taken its toll\non anyone, and just like\nGing, we were all hyped\nfor the day ahead.\nWe started by assisting\nthe sanctuary with its\ndaily chores; trainers were\nexchanged for wellington\nboots, and backpacks for\nshovels and spades. My\nsmall group started by\nwheelbarrowing fresh hay\nto the cow shed. Distributing hay amongst the cows\nwas slightly daunting at\nfirst, but the mighty cows\nwere incredibly tranquil\nand undisturbed by our\npresence. Some were\neven quite playful; they\napproached us, eager for\na pat on the head or to be\nshowered with confetti of\nhay.\nOverall, the volunteering work was very\nminimal, as there was a\nhuge group of visitors on\nthe day. By noon, we were\nfree to just spend time\nwith the animals. It was\nlunch time for the pigs,\nand their diet is surprising\nto say the least. From\nbig trays, we grabbed\navocados, bananas,\nmelons and pineapples\nand fed them to the pigs.\nDonated by supermarkets,\nthe fruits were either\nslightly past shelf life or\ndidn\u2019t fit EU standards\nand would have otherwise\nbeen dumped in landfills.\nThe pigs smashed open\nthe melons with forceful\nbites, and they gobbled\ndown the bananas and\navocados. Once they\nwere satiated, they each\ntottered back to their own\npaddock and went back to\nsleep (relatable).\nClouds cleared briefly\nand we were blessed with\nwarm sunshine as we fed\ntangerines to the cows\nwho would extend their\ntongues and swiftly sweep\nthe fruit from your palm.\nIf you weren\u2019t quick to\nretract your hand, you\nmay feel the sharp graze\nof the rough tongue of the\ncows. The cows had fur\nthat felt like velvet, and\nthey each had their own\nunique mop of hair.\n\u2018FRIEND was established in 1994, when its\nfounder Marion bought\na disabled lamb at a\nlivestock market. She\nthen decided all animals\nthat came would have a\nlife of peaceful existence\nfor the rest of their days.\nToday FRIEND Farm\nAnimal Sanctuary is run\nwith a vegan philosophy\nof education about animal\nwelfare and the need for a\nworld of compassion to all\nits inhabitants, fauna and\nflora alike. As well as educating visitors about the\nanimals, we are working\nto make the sanctuary an\nexample of ecological\nSUSTAINABILITY\nEach of the animals has its own personality \\\\ FRIEND\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 1ST\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nXiuchen Xu\nSustainability Writer\nEnvironmental society hosts a visit to an animal sanctuary\nsustainability, for example\nplanting native trees and\ngrowing food as part of a\npermaculture design.\u2019\n\u2018Our mission is to offer\nsanctuary to unwanted,\nneglected and abused\nanimals, while educating\nabout animals, veganism\nand ecological sustaina-bility.

Animals are\ndefinitely capable of\nsuffering in the same way\nas humans. They have a\ncentral nervous system,\nmeaning that they have the\ncapability to suffer. Pigs\nare more intelligent than\ndogs and human babies,\nso if people believe that\ndogs and babies can suffer\nthen pigs can too. Since it\nwas my first time being so\nclose to pigs, chickens or\ncows, it was very moving\nto see them live so happily\nat the sanctuary. For the\nfirst time, I truly saw the\nanimals as affectionate\nindividuals. Each had\ntheir own personality,\nand it is difficult to think\nthat they could have been\nchopped up and served\nup on a dinner plate.

Rool, the new King in Town\nE\nnough talking\nabout the\nveterans, let\u2019s\nlook at one of\nthe new faces of Smash.\nSay goodbye to Bowser,\nKing of the Koopas and\nto King Dedede, there\u2019s\na new king of the play-ground, character #67 of\nthe roster, King K. Rool.\nThis big bad crocodile is\nthe main antagonist of\nthe Donkey Kong series,\nand is now a brand new\nHeavy fighter in Ultimate.\nHis hefty mass not only\ngives him very powerful\nattacks at close range, but\nhis unique moveset grants\nhim a decent mid range as\nwell as protection from\nenemies.\nSlow as he may be,\nKing K. Rool still packs\nquite a punch at close\nrange and only needs to\nhit a few normal, tilt or\nair attacks on his enemy\nto get them at kill-percent\nfor any smash attack.\nAlthough his attacks may\nbe impressive the real\nhighlight of his moveset\nis his Super Armor. K.\nRool\u2019s golden chest\nplate passively blocks\nany incoming attacks,\npreventing him being\ninterrupted when using a\n\u2018belly-attack\u2019 (neutral-air,\nside-tilt, up-smash and\ndown-smash). It can\nhowever break like a\nshield, leaving you very\nvulnerable, if hit too\nmuch or too hard. Hence\na incredibly powerful tool\nto use often but wisely.\nKing K. Rool also does\na decent job at medium\nrangethankstohisneutral-and side-special attacks.\nIndeed, with no input\nfrom the stick, K. Rool\nwill take out his Blunderbuss, a gun which fires a\nslow cannonball, dealing\na lot of damage. Furthermore, if you hold down\nhis neutral-special, the\ngun can suck an opponent\nback in and throw them\naway. This move can kill\nmost light characters at\n100% damage! For his\nside-special, K. Rool\nwill throw his crown like\na boomerang, creating\nadditional pressure for\nyour enemy as it comes\nback. In addition to these\nprojectiles, King K. Rool\nhas 2 more tricks up his\nsleeve. His down-special\nis his Gut Check, which\nwill block a frontal attack\nwith his Super Armor and\ncounter it immediately.\nAnd finally, K. Rool has\nthe best recovery of all\nHeavies, with his up-spe-cial Propellerpack, which\nnot only brings him back\non stage from anywhere\nbut slightly damages\nenemies overhead preventing any spikes.\nNow the problem is\nthat your opponents are\nusually too fast for you,\nmaking it hard to actually\nhit them especially with\nyour slow smash attack.\nBut worry not, as some\ncombos exist to help you\nsecure the kill. The first\none is the \u2018Bury & Flop\u2019\nwhich simply consists of a\ndown-throw or -tilt immediately followed up by a\ndown-smash; it will bury\nyour opponent and can\nkill them from 60% and\nup! An the other one is the\n\u2018Suck & Cuck\u2019, a cheeky\ncombo that uses the\nneutral special off stage\nas you are falling to suck\nand throw your opponent\nunder the map. You can\nthen laugh diabolically\nas they fall to their death\nwhilst you recover easily\nwith your up-special!\nOverall, King K. Rool\ncan be considered as the\nbest Heavy in the game,\nhowever he can still\nsuffer against fast and/or\nranging characters such\nas Sonic, Pichu or Marth.\nThis brings him in low- to\nmid-tier in competitive\nplay, but at low level,\nthe players sometimes\nstruggle to punish him\nproperly, bringing him\nup to high-tier. But more\nimportantly K. Rool is\nincredibly fun to play so\nlock him in already and\nget smashing!\nSmash Corner - Ness,Totally Not Sans\nT\nhis obscure character originates\nfrom Mother 2, a\ngame originally\nreleased in Japan but given\na western release in 1995\nas \u201cEarthbound\u201d. Despite\nhis little-known status,\nNess has appeared in\nevery Smash Bros. game\nsince the original on the\nN64. He has come a long\nway since, with ridiculous\nair mobility and combo\npotential this character\nhas enough depth to get\nany fan excited!\nThe name of the game\nfor Ness is in his throw\ncombos and following\naerial strings. At low\npercent down throw\ncombos into most aerials\nand at high percent\nback throw is one of the\nstrongest kill throws in\nthe game. Forward air\nhas a huge hitbox with\nplenty of priority; at low\nto mid percent it can even\ncombo into itself. Up air\nhas a similar effect and\ncan be used to juggle the\nopponent while racking\nup decent damage. Back\nair on the other hand is\none of Ness\u2019 main kill\noptions able to kill in the\nlow 100\u2019s if hit near the\nledge.\nNess\u2019 depth comes\nfrom the unique ways he\ncan use the majority of\nhis kit. His side special\nis PK Fire. This is your\nmain zoning tool as well\nas a combo starter. If you\ncan hit the opponent with\nthis they will be stuck in\nhit stun for a considerable\namount of time.\nNess\u2019 down special is\nPSI Magnet. It is a very\nunique move as it has both\na hit box and functions\nas a projectile absorber,\nhealing Ness when any\nenergy-based projectile\ncomes into contact with\nit. PSI Magnet can also be\nused to stall Ness\u2019 falling\nspeed, allowing his less\nthan stellar recovery to be\nmuch less predictable.\nHis neutral special, PK\nFlash while having potent\nkill power is not a viable\nmove option due to it\nbeing easy to avoid and\nhaving a long charge up\ntime. This move should\ngenerally be avoided\nexcept for in very specific\nsituations.\nPK Thunder, Ness\u2019\nup special, is a steerable\nball of lightning that can\nhit either Ness or his\nopponent. Hitting your\nopponent, a great way to\nharass the enemy when\noff-stage. Using the ball\nto hit yourself is the main\nway you\u2019ll recover as\nNess, and if you manage\nto catch the opponent with\nyour subsequent flying\nball of Ness it will likely\nlead to a kill.\nIf PK Thunder and PK\nFire aren\u2019t enough to stop\nyour opponent getting\nback to stage, charging\ndown smash while at the\nledge (facing inwards)\ncauses the yo-yo to stall\nthere, effectively preventing the enemy grabbing\nthe ledge.\nA good combo to get\nyou started is as follows:\nPK Fire into a grab and\nthen down throw. Immediately follow up with a\nstring of rising forward\nairs to knock the opponent\noffstage.\nThis deals around 60%\nand gives you significant\nstage advantage right\nfrom the get go.\nI would place the boy\nfrom Onett solidly in mid\ntier. He has outrageous potential in the neutral with\nhigh priority moves and\nrelatively high kill power\n(see forward smash),\nhowever his exploitable\nrecovery leaves him in a\ntricky situation against\nanyone with a counter\nor a reflector. If you\u2019re\nlooking to learn more, I\nrecommend checking out\nJtails on YouTube. Happy\nSmashing!\nGAMES\nGAMES\nMichael Cognet\nGames Writer\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Writer\nThe Kremling King comes aboard the Smash train// Nintendo\nAn around the world with Ness\u2019s yoyo // Nintendo\n\n"

Scottish circus\nperformer and show\ndirector Ellie Dubois has\ncreated No Show, a show\nbringing failure, defeat\nand frustration to the\nspotlight. Dubois created\nthis theatre/mini circus to\nshow the general public\n(by that I mean us, non-cir-cus people) more than just\n\u201cthe tip of the iceberg, the\n1%\u201d that we are normally\nexposed to. No Show won\na Herald Angel Reward\nat the Edinburgh Fringe\nAward in 2017 and has received numerous positive\nreviews.\nThe show focused on\nfive women dressed in\nmatching striped outfits,\ninteracting frequently with\nthe audience, each getting\nher own 15 minutes in\nthe spotlight. Each of the\nwomen shows off her\nown unique talents, from\nthe ever-so-dangerous\nsteel-wheel to handstands.\nOne woman gets lifted up\nby some sort of a trapeze\nattached to nothing but\nher ponytail. During\nthese acts the women fall\nvictim to critique and\nharsh words from their\ncolleagues. As the show\npromised all the women\nfail at some point and are\nmet with disappointment\nand neglect. \u201cBetter luck\nnext time\u201d, \u201cYou can try\nagain tomorrow\u201d, \u201cPush\nthat smile\u201d and \u201cCould\nyou show us more splits,\nwe\u2019ve paid for more\nsplits\u201d are phrases thrown\nat these poor women by\ntheir own peers. More\noften than not though,\nthey succeed at performing very skillful tricks,\nleaving the audience is\nstunned. Altogether, the\nshow leaves a lot to desire\nfor the audience. Instead\nof seeing them fail time\nafter time, instead of\nseeing sweat and tears we\nget seemingly very scheduled missteps mixed in\nwith a bit of ill-performed\ndark humour. The show\nis predictable. During the\n65-minute long playtime\nwe barely delve any\ndeeper than 10% down\nfrom the tip of the iceberg.\nTowards the end one of the\ngirls gives us a heartfelt\nstory about going to circus\nschool alongside boys and\nalways being \u201cgood\u2026 but\nfor a girl\u201d. It is a topic\nworth exploring of course,\nbut the superficiality of\nit all leaves something\nto desire. A bit over an\nhour is not a long time\nto go in-depth of course,\nbut there could be less\njumping around and cartwheeling and more exploration of the actual topics.\nThe show tries so hard to\nreach that next level but\ndoesn\u2019t quite get there.\nSportsmanship and failure\nfor women is a concept\nthat has definitely been\nexplored before to more\nsuccess, with films such as\nMillion Dollar Baby and\nlast year\u2019s Battle of the\nSexes. That\u2019s not to say\nthe show isn\u2019t well-prac-ticed, the tricks do really\ndeserve applause. But it\u2019s\na visually entertaining 65\nminutes at most. The plot\nand the acting lack that\nlittle bit of extra oomph.\nSo, I say: \u201cbetter luck\nnext time\u201d No Show!\nAnywhere \u2013 an exploration with ice\nA\nnywhere is\na tempting\nmarvel, promising a puppet\nmade mostly from ice,\nwhich slowly dissolves\nthroughout the piece.\nThis is the debut UK\nperformance of Anywhere\nas part of the London International Mime Festival\n2019. L\u2019Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de L\u2019Entrouvert was formed in\n2009 by Elise Vigneron\nand aims to create a contemporary approach to the\nart of puppet theatre.\nAnywhere is based\non Henry Bauchau\u2019s\n\u2018Oedipus on the Road\u2019.\nOedipus begins the\njourney back from Earth\nas a blind beggar, seemingly rejected and alone.\nHe is followed by his\ndaughter Antigone. The\nmore Oedipus walks the\nclearer the path becomes\nuntil he reaches the crossroads of the worlds.\nIn the intimate space of\nThe Pit at the Barbican,\nthe performance starts\nwith a lit block of ice.\nUpon which a hooded\nfigure writes the first\nlines of the poem, accompanied by a crisp\nvoiceover and discordant\nmusic. The black writing\nmelts and drips down the\nblock symbolising tears,\ncreating a chilling effect\ninstantly drawing you into\nthe performance. The mix\nof sound, live raindrops,\nvisuals and eerie lighting\ncreates a phenomenal\nsensual experience.\nThe ice puppet is then\nrevealed at the back,\ncovered in fabric to represent Oedipus the blind\nbeggar. Using a white\ncane and some small rock\nobstacles, you instantly\nbelieve in this full-fledged\nsilent character, wanting\nto reach out to help. A\nhuge crash, as the ice\nblock crumbles to the\nground, jolts the audience\nout of this state.\nAt this point Antigone,\nVigneron,joinsthepuppet,\nremoving the clothing and\nrevealing the beautiful ice\nstructure. Vigneron fully\ncaptivates the audience\nwhilst carrying the puppet\nround the slate circle.\nThe audience are on\ntenterhooks, feeling the\npain of walking barefoot\non the many precarious\npieces of slate whilst\nunderstanding the deep\nconnection between the\ntwo characters.\nThroughout the piece\nthis connection is fas-cinating; moving from\ntenderness to desperation\nand by the end loss and\ndespair. This is beautifully\nmatched by the slow melt\nof the puppet, with the\nwhiteicebecomingclearer\nthroughout the piece. As\nthe puppet begins to melt,\nthe live rain falls. At the\nclimax, where pieces of\nice fell off the puppet, the\nstage is covered in mist as\nOedipus ascends into the\nsky.\nDuring the performance little attempts are\nmade to hide the puppet\nstrings. The choice to\nhoist the puppet from long\nstrings, controlled side of\nstage by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Barreau,\nis made a feature at many\npoints. This highlights the\ninevitability of the path\nOedipus would lead and\nthe struggle Antigone\nwould have to let go. It\nis marvellous to observe\nthe precise control and\npoints where turmoil was\nrepresented through the\ntwisting of these strings.\nWhilst I loved this performance and marvelled\nat its uniqueness, I am\nnot sure I would have\nfully understood the story\nwithout reading up on it\nfirst. Although, created by\na theatre company which\nstrives to provoke thought\nand asks the audience to\nquestion, perhaps this is\nno bad thing.\nAll striped up // Tristram Kenton\nBringing the story of \u2018Oedipus on the Road\u2019 to life with a thought-provoking melting ice puppet\nARTS\nRebekah Byford\nArts Writer\nWhere?

In a\nsnippet that was circulated\nlater the smiling teenager\n(Nick Sandmann) was\npainted as an arrogant,\nracist and xenophobic\nyoung man, who ridiculed\nand belittled an old Native\nAmerican and Marine\nveteran (Nathan Philips),\nwho was beating his\ndrum. The incident gained\nvirality and sparked intense online reactions.\nLonger videos that were\nlater posted on Youtube\nshowed a more complicated story, where the high\nschool students stand at\nthe steps of the Lincoln\nMemorial waiting for\ntheir bus and Mr. Phillips\nwalks straight into the\nstudent group and starts\nbeating his drum in close\nproximity to Mr. Sandmann\u2019s face, who smiles\nbut does not react verbally\nor physically. Slurs and\nderogatory comments are\nbeing shouted by another\nNative American man and\nmembers of the Black\nIsraelite group, while\nthe teenagers perform\nhigh school chants. The\nwhole story can instead\nbe seen as a stare-down,\ncommon in boxing fights.\nSandmann\u2019s smile can be\nseen as either arrogant,\ndisrespectful or due to the\nteenager\u2019s bafflement or\nconfusion at the situation.\nparents. Online activists\neven called on potential\nuniversities to reject\nfuture applications from\nthe teenagers. Instead of\ncalming the otherwise\nminor situation, online\npundits from CNN,\nNBC and Daily Mail\nas well as social media\nactivists on Facebook\nand Twitter started an\nonline campaign against\nthe private all-male\nCovington Catholic High\nSchool, in particular, and\nagainst Trump supporters\nin general.\nIt seemed that some\nviewed the incident as a\nproxy war, a battefield on\nwhich to protest against\nUS President Trump, the\nMAGA slogan, his border\nwall proposal and pro-life\nsupporters. Looking at the\ncase it is likely that the\nmedia reports amount to\nlittle more than slander\nand libel. The case is\nunlikely to just disappear,\nwith defamation suits\nin the courts and should\nserve as a prime example\nof fake news.\nEver since US President\nTrump coined the term\n\u201cfake news\u201d, it has been\nevident that various journalists have abandoned\ntheir primary job descriptions (i.e. reporting reality\nand hard truth backed up\nby facts and statistics) and\nthe government needs to\nthink about introducing\nfinancial and regulatory\npenalties for journalists,\nwho spread falsehood. A\njournalist, whose articles\nare retracted, e.g. say\n5 times, could lose his\naccreditation; media\ncompanies could lose\nDo you like this music? // Youtube\n\u201cGovernment\nneeds to\nintoduce\nfinancial and\nregulatory\npenalties for\njournalists that\nspread fake\nnews\u201d\nhave instead become political and social activists.\nA system where media\ncompanies are required to\ngenerate webpage visits\nand views to be financed\nthrough advertising\nproceeds as well as an\noverflow of information\nand the lack of time to\ncritically engage with\ncomplex topics, has led\nto a toxic environment on\nsocial media, where speed\nbeats reality. Denzel\nWashington, a respected\nOscar winner, famously\ndescribed the effects of\ntoo much information as\n\u201cthe need to be first, not\neven be true anymore\u201d.\nBy reporting fake news\nand spreading inaccurate\nstories, the media companies endanger themselves\nand their most-important\nasset: credibility, which\nis hard earned but can be\nlost fairly quickly and\nis not quickly regained.\nReaders, are fed up with\nthe fake reporting, and are\nabandoning the traditional\nmedia outlets for alternative media providers\nor online personalities\non YouTube. As a result\nYouTube\u2019s net revenue,\nas a proxy for viewership,\nhas surged by 75% since\n2015.\nHow can this vicious\ncircle of fake news be\nbroken? Three parties\nshould be involved: I\nbelieve that it starts with\nthe media companies.\nThey need to realize the\ndanger that fake news\nposes to them and their\nguild and start retracting\nproven fake news stories\nand issuing apologies to\ntheir victims. Journalists,\nwho purposefully spread\ntwisted or fake stories,\nshould be disciplined ap-propriately. Additionally,\ntheir license. These could\nbe measures. The government also needs to address\nthe issue of corporate tax\nevasion (e.g. of Amazon,\nFacebook, Google etc.)\nand how the additionally\nreceived funds might be\nused to reimburse media\ncompanies whose content\nis being used by social\nplatforms. This should\nreduce the need for\nposting clickbait or fake\nnews stories. Last, but not\nleast we as readers need\nto recognise our responsibility to critically evaluate\nthe facts, employ multiple\nsources and call out fake\nnews with arguments\nbacked up by statistics\nand science. Readers need\nto build their opinion\nthrough own research,\ninstead of blindly repeating media statements or\nspin stories.\n\u201cThe incident\nseemed highly\ntrivial to make\nnational news\u201c\nEither way, the incident\nseemed too trivial to make\nnational news.\nMeanwhile the occurrence spiralled out\nof proportion and led to\nangry protests and death\nthreats against the teenage\nhigh schoolers and their\n\n"

Although\nthe gilets jaunes started by\nprotesting against rising\nfuel taxes, the movement\nhas become increasingly\nextreme with the manifestation of anti-government\nsentiments. To fully understand the evolution\nof the movement, we\nmust take a closer look\nat events that have led to\nthe current state of affairs.\nThe first major protest on\nNovember 17th saw large\nscale barricades of roads.\nThe protests attracted\nover 300,000 people and\ncaused major chaos. By\n21st November there\nhad been 585 civilian\ninjuries and two deaths,\nwhich lead to President\nMacron deploying troops\nto combat the violence.\nThe gilets jaunes has no\nofficial organisation, no\nidentified leader and no\npolitical affiliation, so just\nhow did the movement\nbecome such a threat to\nthe French government?\nIt all began initially\nwith a single online\npetition to lower fuel\ntaxes launched in May by\nPriscillia Ludosky. The\npetition quickly gained\ngreat momentum, and by\nmid-October it had over\n300,000 signatures (and\nnow has over 1 million\nsignatures). The anti-fuel\ntax petition resonated\nwith middle- and work-ing-class motorists in\nFrance, especially as there\nwere impending further\nfuel tax rises proposed by\nrole. The idea for a\nnational blockade was\nlaunched by \u00c9ric Drouet\nand Bruno Lefevre\nthrough the creation of\na Facebook event. Also,\naround this period, a\nviral video was posted\nby Ghislain Coutard\nwhich proposed the\nuse of high-vis jackets\nduring the protests, the\nyellow vest has since\nthen become the symbol\nof this movement.\nAnother important viral\nvideo was by Jacline\nMourad who criticised\nMacron\u2019s policies as\nthey favoured the rich.\nThe video resonated with\nthe people of France,\nas many believed the\nenvironmental duties\nare placed unfairly upon\nthem as the problems\nwere caused by big cooperation\u2019s.\nFollowing the initial\nprotest, increasingly\nviolent protests ensued.\nOn 24th of November,\nprotesters set fires in\nthe streets of Paris, and\npolice started using\ntear gas to deter the\nprotesters . By the beginning of December, an\nantiMacron protest was\norganised, marking the\nbeginning of the change\nfrom anti-fuel tax to\nmore anti-governmental\nprotests. More than\nwidespread support in\nFrance (polls found that\n70% of French people\nsupported the gilets\njaunes). The influence of\nthe gilets jaunes has also\nspread internationally,\nwith similar protests\noccurring in multiple\ncountries including\nThe French people doing what they do best // Flickr\n\u201cThe influence\nof the gilets\njaunes has\nspread\ninternationally\nwith protests\nin Canada,\nRussia and\nCroatia\u201d\n100 cars were burned\non 1st December, and\nthe protests resulted in\nthe death of a second\nmotorist and an elderly\nAlgerian woman. The\nestimated property\ndamage was 3-4 million\nEuro.\nBy 4th December, the\nproposed tax rises were\nsuspended. However,\nthe protests contin-ued, as the anger with\nMacron\u2019s pro-business\npolicies spread like\nwildfire. Right now, the\ngilets jaunes crisis is\nbecoming increasingly\ndifficult for the government to deal with, as the\nmovement has gained\nCanada, Russia, and\nCroatia.\nThe situation in\nFrance is also worrying\nas the movement is\nslowly being highjacked by anarchists\nand extremists. Indeed,\na poll has shown that\nmany protesters had\neither not voted or voted\nfor far-right or far-left\ncandidates during the\n2017 presidential elec-tions, and it is clear that\nmany of the protests are\ninsurrectionist in nature.\nThe future of France is\nshrouded in uncertainty\nas the protests continue;\nwill the government\nregain its stability or\nwill the country spiral\nfurther into chaos.\n\u201cThe anti-fuel\ntax petition\nresonated with\nmiddle and\nworking class\nmotorists\u201d\nMacron to take effect in\nJanuary.\nFollowing the\npetition, social media\nplayed an important\n\n"

Chances are,\nyou probably love Kinder\nBueno as well as all things\nFerrero. Coming at a close\nsecond for me, the combination of chocolate paired\nwith the hazelnut twist\nthat we know all too well\nfrom our eating-Nutella-with-a-spoon binges is\na match made in heaven\n- although you can\u2019t really\ntaste the Kinder Bueno in\nhere, does it matter?\nRating: 4.5/5\nVegan Cookies n\u2019\nCream\nJulia says: If you\u2019re\nvegan and concerned\nabout the ingredients used\nin typical cookie dough,\nthis is the answer - one of\ntwo great vegan flavours\noffered at ND. Tastes just\nlike a super chocolaty and\nrich brownie (and for the\nNo-Meat Monday haters\n- you really wouldn\u2019t be\nable to tell it was vegan!),\nsmells great and is slightly\nless sweet than the rest.\nEva says: Honestly, as\nsomeone who\u2019s always\nwanted to go vegan but\nwas always too worried\nabout missing out on\nyummy food following\nan awful experience at\na vegan restaurant, this\ncookie dough restored my\nfaith in vegan food and\nfelt just like the push I\nneeded. Probably the least\nsweet cookie dough on the\nlist, cookies n\u2019 cream is\nprobably the only flavour\nyou can have with no ice\ncream without it feeling\ntoo sickly.\nRating: 3/5\nSalted Caramel\nand Honeycomb\nEva says: Caramel is\none of those words where\neveryone\u2019s complaining\nabout the pronunciation\n- is it car-mel or car-a-mel? Well, one thing we\nwon\u2019t be arguing about is\nhow delicious this salted\ncaramel and honeycomb\ncookie dough is. With\nbits of honeycomb adding\na wonderful texture to\nthe dough and the salted\ncaramel adding a little\nextra oomf, this was\ndefinitely one of my fa-vourites.\nJulia says: Although\nthis flavour is particularly\nsweet, that should not\nbe taken as a vice - the\nperfect combination of\nsweet & salty in a tub,\nplus it being one of the\nmore original flavours\ndefinitely appealed to me\nand places this in my top\nthree favourite flavours.\nAdd some marshmallows\non top and you\u2019ve got a\nmatch made in heaven.\nRating: 4.5/5\nWhite Chocolate\nChip\nJulia says: My favourite thing about this is the\nnoticeable flavour of the\nchocolate chunks, which\nare often enveloped\ntoo much in the dough\nto actually taste them.\nAlthough a bit too sweet\nfor my liking (dark chocolate fans hit me up!), it was\nstill definitely worth a try\nand will probably become\none of your favourites if\nwhite chocolate is your\npreference (is it really\nchocolate though?).\nEva says: White\nchocolate is one of my\nfavourite things ever,\nand that combined with\ncookie dough is definitely\nsomething worth swiping\nright for. This is your\nclassic chocolate chip\nwith a twist and is the\nmost amazingly indulgent\ntub of cookie dough. The\nsmall chunks of white\nchocolate literally melt in\nyour mouth, and the aftertaste is something I wish I\ncould savour forever (and\nalways).\nRating: 4/5\nA mouthwatering assortment of Naked Dough flavours // Julia Dabrowska\nFOOD\nJulia Dabrowska\nEva Tadros\nFood Editors\nISSUE 1712\nFELIX\nFOOD food.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\n\u201cThis flavour\nis like your\nclassic cookie\ndough, until\nyou encounter\na chewy\nmarshmallow\nwithin\u201d\n\u201cWhether\nyou\u2019re a\nseasonal\nchocolate\neater or\nbreathe, eat,\nand sleep\nchocolate, this\nflavour will\n100% satisfy\nevery single\none of your\ncravings\u201d\nSprinkles &\nMarshmallow\nEva says: Unfortunately, after trying so many\namazing flavours, this\nwas not the one for me.\nIt tasted like something\nthey served us in school\nlunches way back. Definitely the sweetest of the\ndoughs, this flavour was a\nlittle difficult to eat, even\nwith ice cream to kill the\nsweetness a bit, and gave\nme the classic \u201csugar\nheadache\u201d.\nJulia says: This flavour\nis like your classic cookie\ndough with a little boost\n- you think you\u2019re having\nthe typical, until you\nencounter a chewy marshmallow within which\nmakes this flavour super\ncool.

Does\nDIY cookie dough live\nup to the high standards\nof professionally curated\nrecipes?\nAs soon as it arrived in\nthe post, the excitement\nbegan. The cute packaging\nand the pink tissue made\nfor memorable first im-pressions. When it came\nto actually making it, we\ngot some friends together\nto truly make the most of\nthe experience. The instructions on the package\nwere pretty simple: add\nthe cookie dough mix to\nsome butter and milk, and\nstir until combined, and\nyou get a whole 8 portions\nfor you and your friends\nto share (or just you, of\ncourse!). Initially, we\nwere worried about the\nproportions of milk and\nbutter suggested on the\npackaging, but with a little\npatience (a good exercise\nto practice the skill of not\neating the whole thing\nwhile mixing!), you will\nend up with something\nthat looks exactly like\nthe cookie dough served\nin their shops. Magic at\nwork basically.\nThe taste? Almost identical to the store-bought\nchocolate chip cookie\ndough - amazing. And\nthe best part of the whole\nthing is, you can store it\nin your fridge or freezer\nfor a few weeks or even\nmonths (not like it will\nlast that long, who are\nwe kidding), so you can\njust nibble on it whenever\nyou feel like it! This also\nsolves the problem of\ngetting into a sugar coma\nafter consuming an entire\ntub from the store, but\nthat\u2019s all easier said than\ndone really...\nOverall, although it\ncosts \u00a310, the DIY kit is a\npretty worthwhile investment if you\u2019re satisfied\nwith the classic flavour\nand yields many more\nservings than your typical\ntub, plus it makes for a\nsuper fun bonding activity\nwith your friends!\nAlso, special shoutout\nto Steph for allowing us\nto try all these different\nflavours, and of course\nour friends for trying\nthem all out with us!\nSo what are you\nwaiting for? Head straight\ndown to your nearest\nNaked Dough and you\u2019ll\nsee exactly what we\u2019ve\nbeen raving about!

barring\ndisaster - will retain the\nWomen\u2019s title ahead of\nUCL who currently lie\n122 points behind.\nBack in the men\u2019s race,\nImperial\u2019s Niki Faulkner\ncruised to a bronze behind\nstrong performances\nfrom St. Mary\u2019s and UCL\nathletes.\nSecond home from\nthe boys was rising star\nCharlie McFadzean who\nfinished in the top 10 for\nthe first time with a 9th\nplaced finish. Just outside\nthe top 10 was orienteering scholar Mihaly Ormay\nin 11th, and the A team\nwas rounded off by good\nruns from Mark Pollock\nand Fergus Johnson who\nfinished within 1 second\nof one another.\nThiswasImperial\u2019sbest\nMen\u2019s performance of the\nseason, all-but-guarantee-ing them a podium with\nReading languishing far\nbehind in 4th place in the\nleague.\nIt is also worth noting\nthe depth of Imperial\u2019s\nsquad, with Imperial\nleading the B, C, D,\nand E(!) teams in both\nthe men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nleagues.\nIn fact, Imperial\u2019s\nWomen\u2019s B team are\ncurrently in bronze medal\nposition overall which\ncould result in an unprecedented double-podium at\nthe final race next month.\nAdditionally, with St.\nMary\u2019s failing to field an\nentire women\u2019s team, the\nresult now leaves Imperial\n3 points clear in first place\nin the mixed Mike Baggs\nTrophy Standings with\njust one race to go.\nWith UCL close\nbehind, Imperial will need\nthat both their men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s teams average\nsecond place in the final\nrace to ensure they bring\nhome the title.\nThe final race of the\nseason takes place at\nWormwood Scrubs on\nWednesday 27th\nFebruary.\nA King\u2019s athlete couldn\u2019t help but defect for the traditional pre-race team photo// ICXC\n\n"

He\nlooked at me in an erotic\nway that made me feel\nvery uncomfortable. I\ntold him that I couldn\u2019t\ngo with him because I had\narranged online meetings\nwith people in another\ntime zone. I returned to\nmy seat and, when another session of presentations\nstarted, he suddenly sat\nnext to me and started to\nwhisper his comments on\nthe presentations. I hinted\nfor him to stop talking\nbut it seemed as if he\njust didn\u2019t get it. During\nthe presentation his arm\nand whole body leaned\nagainst me - essentially\noccupying the table in\nfront of me so I had to\nlean back to escape his\nbody contact. I even tried\nto ask to him to reposition.\nHowever, because of the\nongoing presentation, I\ncouldn\u2019t say it very loudly\nso he pretended that he\ncouldn\u2019t hear or even\nunderstand me. At the end\nof the presentation, while\npeople asked questions,\nhe asked me again if I\nwould like to go to the\nbar with him. I said no\nand, at that moment, I\nknew I wanted to stay as\nfar away as possible from\nthis person. I started to\nthink about how to avoid\nhim for what remained of\nthe conference. As soon as\nthe session ended, I said\nthat it was nice talking to\nhim and immediately left\n(ran). The next day, during\na break, he asked me for\nmy name card, to which I\nreplied that I didn\u2019t have\none; then he asked for my\nphone number (instead of\nmy email). I wrote down\nan incorrect one. During\nthe second (final) day I\ntried to avoid him as much\nas I could. Whenever he\napproached, I tried to\nhave conversations with\nothers or stay close to my\ncolleagues.\nFinally, the conference ended and, when\nI returned to my hotel\nto pack, I noticed my\numbrella was gone. I\nrecalled that I left it in\nthe conference room on\nthe day when that guy sat\nnext to me. Since all I was\nthinking at the end of the\nsession was getting rid of\nhim, I forgot my umbrella.\nUnfortunately, I no longer\nhad the time to return to\nthe conference centre as\nI had to catch a flight. I\ncalled the centre at the\nairport and asked if they\nhad found an umbrella,\nthinking that my friend in\nthat city could pick it up\nfor me. The centre staff\ntold me that everything\nhad been cleaned up and\nno umbrella was found.\nThe umbrella has a\nsmall Totoro image on the\noutside and small flowers\ninside. It was a gift from\nmy grandma bought from\nthe Japan Centre during\na World Expo. She has\nnever travelled to Japan\nbut remembered that I\nlike Totoro. To this day, I\nregret the loss of my favourite umbrella because\nI was too hasty, running\naway from a douchebag\nwho came to an academic\nconference to hit on\nwomen.\nSupervision Story\nPOSTGRADUATE\nAnonymous\nPostgraduate Student\nD\nialogue. I\nbelieve that in\nthe thorough\nyet enjoyable\nexperience that the PhD\ncan be, we all go through\ntimes of self-doubt and\nquestioning. Not only\nabout the research itself,\nbut about our own capabilities and the, sometimes,\nfearful prospect of having\nto finish. I am glad to have\na supportive supervisor.\nHowever, our relationship\nwould probably not work\nso well if I did not feel\nlike I could talk to my su-pervisor. I can rely on him\nfor guidance regarding my\nresearch, and I also trust\nI will have his support\nwhen I am going through\nhard times in my PhD or\nmy personal life, affecting\nmy work. Knowing that\nmy supervisor is aware\nthat I am a human being\nwho makes mistakes and\nhas limits but is still ready\nand willing to give their\nbest for their work allows\nme to step back during\nstressful times; because I\nknow I have support.\nWhat I find interesting\nabout my relationship\nwith my supervisor is\nthat he gives me as much\nguidance as I ask for.\nFor the rest of the time I\nam free to conduct my\nresearch in the direction I\nwould like to take it. This\nallows me to be independent and at the same time, I\nam certain that I can rely\non someone for guidance.\nAt this stage of my PhD\nI am still unclear about\nwhat my immediate future\nwill look like. However,\nhaving the possibility\nto experience relative\nfreedom in my research\ngives me a taste of what\nit would be like to pursue\na career in academia. In\nmy Department, I observe\nsome fellow PhD students\nbeing very much guided\nin a specific way, which is\noften appreciated. Others\nare practically left alone,\nwith only their peers to\nask for moral support.\nsibility from both parties.\nNevertheless, I believe\nthat students should never\nfeel trapped in this rela-tionship. Unfortunately,\nmany students have the\nimpression that there is no\nway out if the relationship\ndoesn\u2019t work and that\nthey must stick with their\nsupervisor until the end of\ntheir PhD. In my depart-ment, new guidelines are\nnow being put in place\nso that such situations\ncould be resolved. But in\nthe past, I have discussed\nwith fellow PhD students\nwho have been ignored by\ntheir post-graduate tutors\nwhen they sought help.\nHopefully this will not\nhappen any longer, and I\nwish that any new student\nat College will understand\nthat no matter what their\nsituation is, they can\nalways find support near\nthem.\n(Or how I lost my favourite umbrella)\n\u201cI am glad\nto have a\nsupportive\nsupervisor\u201d\n\u201cOur\nrelationship\nwould\nprobably not\nwork so well if\nI did not feel\nlike I could\ntalk to my\nsupervisor\u201d\nDifferent supervisors\nbehave differently with\ndifferent students, and the\nsupervisor-student relationship requires respon-Through the relationship with my supervisor\nand others around me,\nI have observed how\nfeelings of isolation can\nbe exacerbated by the\nlack of dialogue, as well\nas how beneficial an\nopen dialogue is for our\nwell-being and perfor-mance.\n\u201cThe\nsupervisor-student\nrelationship\nrequires\nresponsibility\nfrom both\nparties\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "The Imperialites win the Global Case Competition at\nNEWS\nBenoit Dubief\nMSc Innovation,\nEntrepreneurship and\nManagement\nW\nhile studying at\nI m p e r i a l\nC o l l e g e\nLondon, one of the\ntop ten universities in\nthe world, one would\nexpect to be faced with\nmany opportunities take\nadvantage of, perhaps\neven more so as a Business School student.\nHowever, the Global\nCase Competition was\nnot one I had expected\nupon arrival, back in\nSeptember 2018, as part\nof the MSc in Innovation, Entrepreneurship\nand Management.\nThis programme is the\nthird Master's degree I\nam pursuing, after being\nenrolled in a Master's in\nBusiness Law from La\nSorbonne in Paris as well\nas an MSc in Management\nfrom a French grande\n\u00e9cole called EMLyon\nBusiness School. As a\nformer entrepreneur in\nthe first years of my undergraduate law studies, I\nhave always been interested in solving today's dig-ital-related strategy issues\nand this cross-curricular\nbackground resulted in a\nsix-month digital strategy\nconsulting internship at\nCapgemini Consulting\n(now called Capgemini\nInvent) in Paris. Even\nthough I declined my pe-nultimate-round interview\nat McKinsey London to\nstart a full-time position\nat Facebook Europe upon\ngraduation and, after\nexperiencing an amazing\nsummer internship there, I\nhave never stopped enjoying strategic case-solving;\nquite the contrary.\nFun fact: I actually\nheard about the Global\nCase Competition on\nFacebook. For those\nunaware of such business\ngames, the concept is the\nfollowing: gather the best\nstudents from the world's\nbest universities to try and\nsolve whatever kind of\ncorporate strategy cases\nthey are given. Hence,\nthe GCC is one of the\nmost prestigious contests\nhosted by Cambridge\nConsulting Network and\nETH Zurich's Graduate\nConsulting Club every\nyear at the University of\nCambridge's St John's\nCollege. Participants are\nrequired to form a team\nof four in order to apply.\nMost of them are ideally\nselected among their\nuniversity's consulting\nclub members so that\neach team stands the best\nchance of taking the top\nspot.\nFun fact number two:\nI decided to take a shot at\nthe competition the day\nbefore the deadline, which\nmeans forming a team was\nquite a challenge in itself,\nnot to mention that I was\nnot part of any consulting\nclub at Imperial. However,\nthe MSc programme I am\nenrolled in is all about\ninnovating, therefore I\ncould not miss such an\nopportunity to apply concepts in the field.\nmy closest classmates,\nEdward Vernon, who I\nhad been working with\nsince October as part of\nour course's group work.\nI noticed his very strong\nbusiness acumen on\ntop of his flawless team\nplaying skills along the\nway, which made him an\nobvious partner in such\na challenge. He told me\nabout another classmate\nSimon Jensen, with whom\nEdward used to practice\nconsulting case studies for\ninterviews, making him\na solid addition. Finally,\nwe were missing only\none member to complete\nthe team, and I thought of\nanother fellow Business\nSchool student, Charles\nJalali-Farhani, who is\npursuing an MSc in Economics and Strategy for\nBusiness. As President of\nImperial's venture capital\nsociety, he previously\nreached out to me in December to help him create\ncommunication media to\nraise awareness about a\nVC Talks event gathering\nsome of the world's best\nVC firms such as Accel.\nAgain, I noted his sharp\nmind and collaborative\nattitude when it came to\nworking together on busi-ness-related topics. He\nalso used to practice consulting case studies during\nhis BSc in Economics at\nLSE. I felt he could be\nthe right match for our\nteam and he immediately\naccepted my offer to join.\nEven though we were\nnow a proper team, the\nonline application portal\nstill required our team's\nname. Considering that\nthe \"Fabulous Four\" and\nthe \"Fantastic Four\" had\nalready been taken by\nquite successful squads\nin the past, we needed to\ncome up with something\nelse. Then I remembered\none of the coolest words\nI had read, thanks to my\nMcKinsey buddy Nas\nAndriopoulos, Imperial\nalumnus and former\nPresident of the Union:\n\"Imperialite\" (as all Imperial students are known).\nround of the competition,\nall teams were required\nto feature whatever recommendation they came\nup with in a maximum of\nfour slides. Needless to\nsay, the 2-hour challenge\nfelt quite tricky for an\n11-page case. On top of it,\nwe were not supposed to\npresent our conclusions,\nwhich meant our entire\nthinking process had to fit\ninto these four slides.\nBeyond the sole\nhurdles of the case, we\nwere immediately struck\nby the devastating effects\nof these hard time con-straints. None of us had\nany specific knowledge\nof such a niche market,\nwhich led us to analyse\nthe case for about half an\nhour before even starting\nto discuss it together. We\nthen struggled to settle\non an efficient structure\nwhich could be both clear\nand extensive. It took us\nabout another hour to get\nto this point, while we\nstill had not yet started\nproducing any content.\nFRIDAY, 1ST\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX ISSUE 1712\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cI decided\nto take a\nshot at the\ncompetition\nthe day before\nthe deadline\u201d\nAs some of you may have\nguessed at this stage of the\nstory, this is how we ended\nup officially applying as\n\"The Imperialites\".\nThe competition started\non Saturday, 12th\nJanuary.\nDuring the afternoon, all\nthe teams were required\nto work on a case about\nthe healthcare industry.\nWe had two hours in order\nto make a recommendation about whether an\nArgentina-based medical\nhardware manufacturer\ncalled Conexia should\nenter the U.S. market or\nnot. Their main product\nwas a real-time claims\nadjudication system\nwhich consisted of an IT\nsolution allowing health\ninsurance companies to\npre-authorise medical\nservices before they are\nrendered to patients by\ndoctors. Even though\nConexia was a strong\nleader in Argentina, the\nU.S. healthcare system\nwas different and far more\nfragmented than its domestic market. During this\nAs soon as we agreed\non content, there were\nonly 15 minutes left to\ndesign our presentation's\nlayout, which translated\ninto hardly anything.\nWitnessing the flawless\nworkflow of some of the\nworld's best talent around\nus was not helping either.\nIn a nutshell, we ended the\nday not convinced of our\ndeliverable at all, quite\ndisappointed with our\noverall performance.\nNevertheless, we did\nnot get that much time to\nprocess or improve what\nwe had done, given that\none of the best parts of\nthe weekend was about to\nhappen. Indeed, all teams\nwere invited to attend\na private formal dinner\nheld in the Great Hall of\nSt John's College. It was\na great opportunity to\nnetwork and engage in\nfriendly conversations\nwith the different teams\nand participants, as well\nas staff and jury members,\nin an incredible place.\nOur team got to talk with\none of the two Cambridge\nteams as well as the ETH\nZurich team, made up of\nbrilliant Engineering PhD\nstudents who seemed to\nbe enjoying the moment\nas much as we were.\nGetting involved in such\nintelligent discussions\nwith bright minds from\nall over the world, while\nbeing surrounded by\ncenturies-old historical\npaintings, almost felt like\na scene straight out of\nHarry Potter. Thereafter,\nwe headed towards St\nJohn's College Bar where\nwe shared a few drinks\nbefore going back home\nin order to get in shape for\nthe next day.\nBefore starting work on a\nnew case, the staff made\nus aware of Saturday's\ngeneral ranking. Suffice\nto say, we were expecting\nthe worst, which hap-pened. Overall, we earned\nthe second lowest grade.\nHowever, none of us gave\nup aiming for the top three.\nSuch a mindset was all the\nmore important in light of\nSunday's rules - Sunday's\nscore would count twice\nas much as Saturday's\ntowards the final average\nscore. This is because\nteams were allocated\nthree hours instead of\ntwo in order to solve the\ncase, before introducing\ntheir recommendations to\nthe jury with an 8-minute\npresentation followed\nby a Q&A session in the\nafternoon.\nSunday's case was\nabout WorldLabs, a\nLondon-based startup\ndeveloping an online\nplatform that connects\nthe innovation ecosys-tem's stakeholders in\norder to foster innovative\nideas through funding,\nresources, collaborations\nand support. The ven-ture's management was\nlooking to scale both\ntheir customer base and\nfunding. Thanks to the\nhardships our team went\nthrough the day before,\nwe immediately agreed\non a splittable structure\nsuch that each of us could\nwork separately while\nproviding content which\ncould be directly featured\nin the presentation that\nI had started working\non just 15 minutes after\nthe round had begun.\nAlthough we felt more\nfamiliar with such an\nThe Imperialites immortalising their first prize in St. John's College yard, University of Cambridge. From left to right:\nEdward Vernon, Simon Jensen, Benoit Dubief & Charles Jalali-Farhani // University of Cambridge Consulting Network\nCambridge\ninnovation-related case,\nour refined approach to\ncommunication, productivity and time-efficiency\nwas key to the overall\nquality of what we delivered as a team. We then\nhad barely 15 minutes\nto rehearse our oral\npresentation and make\nsure our public-speaking\nstrategy was as impactful\nas our slides.\nfirst one would prevent\nus from taking anything\nbeyond the third spot. This\nis why our hopes were\ndashed when that third\nspot was awarded to the\nETH Zurich team, which\nhad already been brilliantly ranked first following\nSaturday's round. Further\nto this announcement, the\npressure became increasingly difficult to take as\nsecond prize was awarded\nto another team composed\nof Master of Engineering\nstudents from Imperial\nCollege London, who delivered tremendous work\nthroughout the weekend.\nThen came the announcement of the com-petition's overall winners.\nIt would be an understatement in the extreme\nto say that we were not\nexpecting to hear our\nteam's name, nor did we\noverflow with happiness\nafter realising we had won\nfirst prize. I especially felt\nlike I achieved one of my\noldest and most rewarding\ndreams. A dream which\nstarted fulfilling itself\nwith my admission to\nImperial. I would like to\nextend heartfelt thanks to\nmy teammates Edward,\nCharles and Simon for\ntheir stellar contribu-tion, both in terms of\nquantitative processing\nabilities and emotional\nintelligence, their trust\nin my endeavour as well\nas the enlightening and\nunforgettable human\nexperience we have been\nthrough as a team.\nIn retrospect, I assume\nthat our story shed an\neven brighter light on\nImperial College Business\nSchool's motto: \"Imperial\nmeans intelligent busi-ness\". It strengthened\nwhat I already believed\nin as well as what we are\nconstantly provided with\nin class. Sometimes, the\nmost clich\u00e9 catchwords\nare also the most genuine,\nespecially when it comes\nto competing for success\nglobally: never give up on\nyour goals, ramp up your\nstrengths while overcoming your weaknesses. At\nthe end of our journey,\nwe were honoured to\nrepresent Imperial with\nsuch values in mind, and\neven prouder to be able\nmake our university stand\nout thanks to the spirit it\nfosters every day.\nDespite such starting\nconditions and several\nwithdrawals from potential teammates due to the\nlimited availability of students around mid-January,\nI was lucky enough to get\nfull support from one of\n\u201cWe ended\nthe day not\nconvinced of\nour deliverable\nat all, quite\ndisappointed\nwith our\noverall\nperformance\u201d\n\u201cGetting\ninvolved\nin such\nintelligent\ndiscussions\nwith bright\nminds from all\nover the world,\nwhile being\nsurrounded\nby centuries-old historical\npaintings,\nalmost felt\nlike a scene\nstraight out of\nHarry Potter\u201d\nThe competition's\nnext and final round was\nheld on Sunday morning.\n\u201cEven though\nour second\nperformance\nfelt solid, we\ntruly believed\nthat the first\none would\nprevent us\nfrom taking\nanything\nbeyond the\nthird spot\u201d\nSunday's jury was composed of WorldLabs' CEO\nand COO as well as strategy consultants from LEK.\nWe were the second team\nto present, given the descending order following\nSaturday's ranking.

First\nperformed in London at\nHer Majesty\u2019s Theatre\nin 1856, it is now the\nmost-performed opera in\nthe world. This particular\nproduction of the Royal\nOpera House, directed by\nRichard Eyre, celebrates\nits 25th anniversary this\nyear.\nAcross the years,\nmany sopranos have\nsung Violetta in various\nproductions. But few\nhave managed to embody\nVioletta, the famed courtesan and \u2018fallen woman\u2019\nof the title. Angel Blue is\ncertainly one of them. In\nthe American soprano\u2019s\nRoyal Opera House debut,\nVioletta blossomed into\nlife on stage, drawing\nthe audience into her tale\nof passion, sacrifice and\nsorrow. From the heights\nof merriment in the\ndrinking song - Libiamo\nne\u2019 lieti calici - to the\ntroughs of sorrow and\nlonging in her last song\nbefore she dies, Blue\nperfectly embodies the\nrich emotion that carries\nVioletta and the opera\nthrough.\nBlue was a delight as\npart of the second cast of\nthis production. Her voice\nwas rich and multi-lay-ered, and the emotion\nin her arias so palpable\none could almost touch\nit in the air. Violetta\u2019s\npassion, and subsequent\nsacrifice of her happiness\nfor the reputation of\nAlfredo, were beautifully\nput across. In one of the\nmost perfectly-executed\nscenes, Giorgio, Alfredo\u2019s\nfather (Simone Piazzola),\ncomes to ask Violetta to\nleave his son for the sake\nof his family\u2019s reputation.\nThe tension hangs in the\nair as Giorgio starts off\ncontemptuous, only to be\ngradually touched by Violetta\u2019s sincerity. Violetta is\ndevastated, then remorse-ful, as she agrees to sacrifice her life with Alfredo\nfor Giorgio\u2019s daughter,\ntelling him that his \u2018young\nand pure\u2019 daughter must\nknow of her sacrifice in\nthe future. Piazzola\u2019s\nGiorgio fully understands\nthat his request is a selfish\none - however, it is one he\nbelieves he is entitled to in\nview of Violetta\u2019s status\nas a courtesan. The way\nhe flinched when Violetta\nasked him to embrace her\nas a daughter was telling\nof his contempt that later\nmelts into respect and\nremorse.\nBlue\u2019s Violetta stands\nher ground, walking a fine\nline between self-respect\nand her unconditional\nlove for Alfredo. She\nplays neither the innocent\nvictim nor the wronged\nwoman. Instead, she faces\nher fate with a kind of\nstoic resignation and a\nrespectability at odds with\nthe reputation that Giorgio\naccuses her of.\nBenjamin Bernheim\u2019s\nAlfredo, on the other\nhand, starts off shy and\ntentative as he meets\nVioletta for the first time\nat her party, then shines\nwith happiness when they\nare living together in the\ncountry. When Violetta\nleaves him at his father\u2019s\nbehest, Alfredo reveals\nhis stubbornness - his\nbelief that the Baron had\ntaken Violetta away from\nhim made him truly unpleasant at Flora\u2019s party\nlater on, where he throws\nhis gambling winnings at\nher as \u2018payment\u2019 for her\ntime with him. Bernheim\nperfectly captured the hurt\nand insult thatAlfredo felt,\nand the loss of control that\nled to his outburst, and the\nremorse that wrecks him\nimmediately after.\nLa Traviata is such an\noft-performed and classic\nopera that it is difficult\nto do anything fresh\nwithout appearing con-trived. However, in this\nproduction the cast have\nprovided subtly fresh interpretations of their roles\nin front of a grand, gilded\nset that transports us to\n1850s Paris. It definitely\nranks as one of the more\ninteresting productions\nof La Traviata in recent\nyears.\nThe Wedding \u2013 a powerful portrayal of the society\nP\nhysical Theatre\ncompany Gecko\nhave produced\nThe Wedding to\ntackle the large social\nissues we face today.\nPerformed many times\nsince its development in\n2015 and toured in 2018,\nthis presentation was\nshown at the Barbican\nas part of the London\nInternational Mime\nFestival 2019. Created\nby Amit Lahav, it fuses\nimpressive staging, move-ment, fast choreography,\nmusic and minimal dialogue composed of many\nlanguages.\nThe show opens with\ngiggling and laughter,\nwith the performer sliding\ndown a chute landing\non teddy bears representing the innocence of\nchildhood. In no time a\nwedding dress is fitted\nand the performer after\nbrief hilarity is quickly\nwed to the workplace.\nThis sequence repeats and\nwe see how The Wedding\nis about our marriage to\nsociety as much as the\nprocess.\nThe workplace seems\nstifling and oppressive. At\none point four performers\nare inside a tiny box, three\nmanagers quizzing one\nman. The small window\nbegins to steam up and you\nfeel the pressure rising, as\nif you were also inside.\nIn a striking moment the\nman rises from the box,\nappearing to be hung from\nhis own tie. In another a\nwoman fights for her individuality among the many,\nstruggling to breathe\nwhile trying to convince\nothers to join her. The\nuse of breath is extremely\npowerful throughout the\npiece and really heightens\nthe tension at crucial\nmoments.\nOther workplace\nproblems were explored\nas well. A striking scene\nusing white props shows\nan internal struggle\nbetween the domineering\nwork life and alcoholism.\nAnother moment shows\nthe strive to become a\nmanager, with them all\nreaching for a red suitcase\nduring some beautiful\ngroup choreography, for\nit ultimately to be won at\nrandom.\nThe fast-paced nature\nof the workplace is\nsharply contrasted by the\nrefugee characters. What\nstarts off as a humorous\naddition, one character\ncoming from a suitcase\nfollowed by three others\nlater becomes tragic.\nTowards the end, one of\nthe refugees is sickeningly turned into a dancing\nmonkey for the bosses\nclothed in a bomb vest and\ngun. This leads to a brutal\nhate crime, in a scene hard\nto ever forget.\nAlongside these struggles the elite are shown\ntowering above on a\nhigh table, without the\nneed to step through the\nmarriage process. Thus,\nit is immensely cathartic\nwatching the socialist\nrevolution rise at the end,\nwhere the elite is pulled\ndown from their stilts.\nFollowed by a moving\ngroup choreography\nwhere all are entwined to\nrebuild each other. The\nfinal rhythmic chorus of\nthe show brings hope of\na collective unity, often\nfound lacking in these\npolitical times.\nThe whole piece is\nled by a strong cast of\nnine who were given a\nwell-deserved standing\novation. It was refreshing\nto see a piece not shying\naway from a political nar-rative, regularly breaking\nthe fourth wall to connect\nwith its audience.\nWith impressive\nstaging and lighting\nthroughout, the choreography and music perfectly\ncombine to make an\nunmissable performance.\nOne which will leave you\nfull of hope for society,\nalongside anguish at the\nmany injustices.\nErmonela Jaho and Charles Castronovo as Violetta\nand Alfredo // Catherine Ashmore\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Writer\nWhere?

A lot\nS\nony pictures is\nvery hit-or-miss\nwhen it comes to\nsuper hero films.\nSam Ramey\u2019s Spider-Man\ntrilogy can probably be\ncredited with kick-starting\nthe modern superhero\nboom, in which SpiderMan 2 is still widely\nconsidered an exemplar.\nHowever, it\u2019s been a\nbumpy ride. Fantastic\n4 has had three films\nover two incarnations\nranging from mediocre\nto unwatchabl--did you\neven remember there\nwere Ghost Rider films?\nSpider-Man Homecoming\nwas brilliant, but Marvel\nclearly had a guiding\nhand on it, and Venom\nwas nothing short of\nterrible. Pair that with\nanimation house that produced Hotel Transylvania\nand The Emoji Movie\nand you have me very\nsceptical. However, Into\nthe Spiderverse defied all\nodds by not only being the\nbest animated movie of\nthe year but possibly the\nbest Spider-Man movie\never. Let\u2019s get into it.\nI\u2019ll start with the\nobvious. This film is\ngorgeous, the com-ic-book-mimicking style\nworks exceptionally well,\nwithexpressivedetailslike\nmotion lines and thought\nbubbles fitting right in. I\nwas struck by a moment\nwhere one of Miles\u2019s\nthought bubbles actually\nbumps into someone in\nthe background because\nit was both a funny detail\nmost would miss and a\ndemonstration of how\nmuch care went into every\nframe. The three less conventional Spider-Chaps\nare all animated in their\nown style, each distinct\nfrom the others while\nfeeling consistent with the\nfilm as a whole. On top of\nall this, I cannot oversell\nhow fluid this film is in\nmotion, from the characters to the environment,\nit all just works. Through\n\u201cThis film is\ngorgeous, the\ncomic-book-mimicking\nstyle works\nexceptionally\nwell\u201d\n\u201cIf you see two\nfilms, make it\nthis one twice\u201d\nstyle and skilled direction\nsequences, what should\nbe clusterfucks are clean\nand easy to read. This film\nhas more artistic flare than\nanything from Pixar in the\nlast ten years and is worth\na watch just for that alone,\nbut there\u2019s more than one\nstring to its bow.\nMiles Morales is a highschool kid from Brooklyn\nwho has recently transferred to a fancy boarding\nschool across the city at\nthe behest of his father.\nHe is unhappy in his new\nsetting and thus sneaks\nout one night to spend\ntime with his uncle and\ngets bitten by a radioactive spider. This coincides\nwith the activation of a\nparticle accelerator which\nbrings a series of parallel\nSpider men-and-women\nto his dimension. Now,\nthey need to find a way\nto get them home before\nMiles\u2019s dimension is torn\napart. I could go into more\ndetail, but A) I think you\nshould experience this\nfilm for yourself and B)\nthe plot is nothing too\nground breaking, it\u2019s the\ncharacters who really\nshine.\nMiles is not just black\nPeter Parker, he is his own\nfully realised character\nwith a history, thoroughly\ndeveloped relationships\nwith his family and a set\nof motivations and struggles which are at once his\nown while also fitting the\nSpider-Man mould. A lot\nof care went into adapting\nhim for this film--and\nthey absolutely nailed\nit, I think I may prefer\nmovie Miles to comic\nMiles at this point though\nI\u2019ll need to see the film a\nfew more times just to be\nsure. Midlife crisis Peter\nParker is great, while he\nis technically a secondary\ncharacter the film makes\nsure to give him well-thought-out motivations\nand flaws which compliment his relationship\nwith Miles. He is also\nan absolute riot, with an\nunending flow of hilarious\nlines just as you\u2019d expect\nfrom a seasoned Spider-Man. Then we have\nGwen Stacey making\nSpider Woman\u2019s cinematic debut. Like with Peter,\nshe has her own back story\nand drives, but bonds\nwith Miles and develops\nbecause of it while also\nserving as something of\na straight man to the rest\nof the team. As an aside,\nI realised there is going to\nbe an entire generation of\nkids who will only know\nGwen as Spider Woman\nand not as the most\nprolific dead girlfriend\nin all of comics. That\u2019s a\ngood thing by the way, a\nvery good thing. All the\nother spider people get\ntheir moment to shine and\njust enough personality to\nmake them memorable.\nSpecial mention needs\nto be made for Nicholas\nCage as Spider-Man\nnoir, stealing the show\nwhenever he\u2019s around.\nEach of the Spiders get\ntheir own introduction\nNetflix version, but he\nsuits the movie perfectly.\nThe rouges galley overall\ndoes a good job, and there\nare some standouts, but\nthis really is the heroes\u2019\nshow.\nDon\u2019t let my gushing\nmake you think the film\nis perfect, there were certainly aspects that didn\u2019t\nwork. There is a moment\nor two which feel maybe\na bit too convenient, and I\nfind it hard to mourn while\nlistening to Post Malone\nbut that may just be me.\nHowever, the soundtrack\nis generally excellent and\nfit Miles\u2019s world well.And\nthat\u2019s the thing, all my\nquibbles are nothing in the\nface of what a complete\ntriumph of animation\nand storytelling this film\nis. It is so stuffed with\nlittle details, references\n(anyone else remember\nclone high?) and hints\nat a broader world that\nI had to force myself to\nstop writing. The good so\nvastly outweighs the bad.\nIf you see one film this\nmonth, make it this one. If\nyou see two films, make it\nthis one twice.\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-*breathes in*-HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH // Sony Pictures\nFILM\nSam Welton\nFilm Writer\nDir: Bob Persichetti, Peter\nRamsey, Rodney Rothman.\nScript: Phil Lord, Rodney\nRothman.
