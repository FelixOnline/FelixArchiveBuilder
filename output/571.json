    "content": "Graham Rickard's second goal, which\neffectively killed off Goldsmiths. IC increased\ntheir lead to 6-.1 with a rasping shot from\nMalcolm Carr and the third from Graham\nRickard.\nTEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,\nLakin, Griffiths, Niccolls, Esberger, Carr,\nRickard, Saunders.\nJim Beer\nFootball\nFourths\nOn a bitterly cold day IC travelled to play top\nof the table LSE 3rds. After a slow start IC\ntook the lead on the quarter hour, Graves\nbundled the ball across the line after the\ngoalkeeper could only parry a Burns cross.\nThis lead did not last long and LSE equalise d after a dubious penalty was\nawarded against Maddy for allegedly holding\nan opponent.\nAt half-time neither side appeared to have\nthe upper hand but early in the second half IC\nscored two quick goals. After a break way the\nball broke for McNicholas who shot the ball\nhome from inside the box. The best goal of\nthe game was the result of our next attack, a cross from the left was cleared to the edge of\nthe box where Buckley fired a fine shot past\nthe goalkeeper.\nMcNicholas scored his second of the match\nwhen he tapped home a rebound. Burns\nfinished the scoring late in the game, a pass\nfrom Hawa found him unmarked in the box\nand he placed his shot wide of the advancing\ni keeper.\nTEAM: Brown, Berns, Maddy, Lay, Chown,\nGraves, Buckley, Dolan, McNicholas, Burns,\nHawa.\nBurns\nFootball\nSixths\nAFTER a two week lay-off the Sixths made\nheavy work of this match, but emerged\nvictorious thanks to a well-taken hattrick by\nSixths top scorer Mike Roche. The game\nstarted badly for IC when Westminster scored\nfollowing a long hopeful clearance. The\nSixths soon gained control of the game and\nequalise when Roche broke away and\nlobbed the ball over the advancing goalkeeper.\nWith Milner heading almost every drop kick\nback into the Westminster half the Sixths\nwere able to pile on the pressure and soon\ntook the lead when Davies's well judged cross\nwas headed in by Roche. Westminster began\nto fight back in the second half but found the\nSixth's defence very difficult to penetrate\nthough they scored from a penalty to make it\n2-2.\nThe Sixths continued to go forward,\nChamberlain and Gartside both had shots\nsaved before Roche restored the Sixth's lead\nwhen he thundered the ball in past a bemused\ngoalkeeper. The Sixths remained on top for the rest of the game and were unfortunate not to\nwin by a bigger margin.\nTEAM: Hampton, Higham, Bradley, Audin,\nDavies, Tinkler, Milner, Gartside, Davies,\nRoche, Chamberlain.\nSport Erratum\nIn FELIX 569 we reported a snooker score of\n3-0. We have been informed that the result\nwas not a whitewash, but 3-1.\nResults:\nSaturday, December 6\nRugby\nIC 1st XV V Esher 4-7\nIC 2nd XV V Esher 0-50\nFootball\nIC 1st XI V St Thomas 2-0\nIC 6th XI V QMC 6-4\nHockey\nIst XI V Old Creightonians 0-0\n2nd XI V Ashford 02\n3rd XI V Farnham 1-5\nResults: Sunday, December 7\nHockey\n1\n1st XI v Southgate (Middx Cup) 0-9\nFootball Firsts\nORGANSMIKOV in his usual complimentary\nmood, was worried by the absence of our two\nnormal centre-backs, but his worries were\nunfounded as Reeve and Griffiths comfortably dealt with the St Thomas forwards\nwho, in the whole match, produced only two\nthreatening shots on goal. Any tension that\nalways accompanies a cup-tie was broken\nearly in the second half when IC scored two\ngoals in five minutes. The first was a solo\neffort from Andy Hartland, who ran from the\nhalf-way with the ball and nonchalantly\ndeposited it in the net. Ged Elliott scored the\nsecond, to make it 2-0.\nFirm tackling from Curran and Smith stifled\na final fling from St Thomas with Bateson and\nElliott controlling midfield easily. Upfront,\nDean, played a steady centre-forward role\nwhile Rickard, who came on a substitute in\nthe last few minutes to provide an outlet for\nKenny Dick's abuse, showed how falling over\nthe ball could be interpreted as trying to\nscore a goal.\nThe result means a semifinal place for the\nfirst, next year and, apart from one more\nleague match, the end of a very successful\nterm.\nTERM: Orgasmikov, Curran, Reeve,\nGriffiths, Smith, Elliott, Dick, Bateson,\nRowley, Dean, Hartland. Sub: Rickard.\nSquash Club\nTO PROVE that IC Squash Club does play\nmatches, here is the report of IC III vs IC IV\nmatch played last Wednesday in Division\nFour of the ULU Squash League.\nIC III 5 IC IV 0\nObviously, you might say (obviously), a straightforward thrashing of the I Vs. Not so. A spirited performance by the IVs led by Mike\nDickens, who lost 9-6 in the fifth to Wayne\nJones, resulted in a tense match, with\nmarkers giving vocal encouragement to\nplayers at certain stages. Needless to say,\nboth teams consumed approximately their\nown weight in cheese and pickle sandwiches\nafter the match. '\nNext term I 'll try to get all results printed,\nwhich might include an IC V team and an IC\nLadies team in the ULU Leagues.\nDon't forget, I 've still got fifteen gut-stung\nclassic 003s( similar to grays light blue)\nselling at \u00a314. Room 131, Falmouth Hall.'1\n-Rich Thompson\nCapt, IC Squash Club\nSailing\nIC v Cambridge University\nIC TRAVELLED up to Cambridge for their last\nmatch of this term, and recorded their first\nwin of the season. Conditions were light, and\nin race one, IC held a commanding position\nby the first mark. IC finished first, second and\nthird. In race two, the team started badly. The\nCambridge boats eventually took first and\nsecond. The third Cambridge boat finished\nlast, but after some argument about penalties it\nseemed that Cambridge had won t ne race.\nHowever, IC made no mistake in the\ndeciding third race, with Chadwick and\nMurray holding comfortable first and second\nthroughout. Kennedy was hounded by all\nthree Cambridge boats, but stayed out of\ntrouble, enabling IC to win comfortably.\nTEAM: Murray, Butler, Kennedy, Mills,\nChadwick, Younghusband.\nTable Tennis\nLAST THURSDAY, the seconds played the\nclosest match of the season so far, and their\nopponents, Texaco I had been going through\na very tough time. The final score was 5-4 to\nImperial College.\nAndy from the seconds played a marvellous\ngame in which he won all three sets, saving\ntwo set points against his opponents and in\none of the sets, the scores were 15-21, 26-24,\nand 21-16-Chat had two good wins after losing one\nset and Gary lost all three sets.\nThe victory gained by the seconds has put\nthem back in the promotion race and there\nwill be two more matches before they climb\nup to the top of the table tennis league.\nWater Polo\nON DECEMBER 1, Imperial Water Polo Club\nplayed a friendly home game against\nBorough Road College, the sports college\nfrom Isleworth. Our opponents got off to a good start with three goals scored from long\ndistance in the first quarter. Chris replied to\nthis with two fine goals from the 'hole'. In the\nrest of the match our passing let us down a bit\nand our marking could have been better.\nThe final score was BRC 8, Imperial 5.\nA return match will be played on February\n21, 1981.\nNovice Regatta\nTHE NOT Ladies Team went along to the\nReading Universities Novice Regatta only to\nfind a nasty draw awaiting them, including an\nextra race. However:\nRace 1 Southampton University lost by\nquite a bit.\nRace 2 Jesus College Cambridge First\nNovice Boat lost by lots and lots (despite\npractising five days a week).\nRace 3 Queen Mary College London lost\nby a canvas (i.e. only just).\nRace 4 Unfortunately, due to that extra\nrace and a universal attack of lassa fever in\nour crew, Clare College Cambridge (almost\nall) novice crew didn't lose by any margin at\nall.\nWe thought getting into the top four out of\neighteen university boat crews was bloody\nmarvellous.\nFriday, December 12, 1980 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nAre the students of Imperial\nCollege aware that Princess Anne\nis to be invited to accept nomination for the office of Chancellor of\nLondon University? Nominations\nclose on Monday, December 22,\n1980.\nR Szczepansi\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir\nI feel obliged to reply to Miss\nSnee's letter that appeared in last\nweek's FELIX. Perhaps as Miss\nSnee is \"responsible for the\nsupervision of the resources of the\nUnion\" she should realise that in\nthe case of Canoe Club these\nresources are inadequate. Particularly as the Club would be\nunable to maintain its present\nlevel of activities without using\nmembers equipment. If the\nUnion had the money available\nto cater for all of Canoe Club's needs, I am sure that members\nwould be delighted at not having\nto bring their canoes down to\nCollege. Meanwhile, perhaps the\nUnion should be grateful that\nthese people supplement the\nClub's equipment rather than\ntaking Miss Snee's attitude which\nseems to be that they are abusing\nUnion facilities.\nI would also like to point out to\nMiss Snee that Canoe Club members do not fraudulently\ninclude their canoes on the\nUnion policy.\nTours faithfully\nEdward Graham\nChairman, Canoe Club\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir\nI must protest most strongly\nabout KM Freidman's letter in\nFELIX recently. Whilst his\npersonal preferences among\ni members of the Exec can be left\naside, I still think he was wrong\nto criticise Rae Snee in those\nterms without knowing the full\nfacts.\nRae Snee borrowed some\nCanoe Club equipment, as she is\nentitled to, and took some Sailing\nClub equipment as well. There\nwere some life jackets which she\nreallocated to the RCS Exec in\ncase they needed them. She\ndidn't realise these were faulty\nlife jackets. Wouldn't it have\nbeen a pity if the RCS Exec had\nsunk \u2014 and not resurfaced.\nHis remarks about Liz Lindsay\nshow him to be a very odious\nperson. He complains about her\nnot being attacked often enough\nin FELIX suggesting this is the\nresult of some Editorial affection\ntowards her. It is because she has\nnot done anything to be attacked\non, in fact she has not done\nanything. I hope this will be\ncorrected next term.\nPH Pearse\nMech Eng 1\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir,\n1 am sorry about this letter,\nit's all my responsibility.\nThe present campaign of\na polo gi sing at IC is disgraceful.\nFirstly we had John T admit it\nwas all my responsibility'Passmore\nconceding that he was totally to\nblame for the No Dice concert\nflop. This confounded most of\nthose at the U GM, so that he was\nnot asked to make a report to\nattempt to assure that it would\nnot happen in future years.\nFELIX reported that he had\nfrustrated the best laid plans of\nthose who wished to see a sabbatical officer take some real\nresponsibility for their actions.\nA similar case is that which\nconcerns Ms Snee. Alter she\nbroke into the Canoe Club store\nand stole some of their equipment, aUG M motion asking her to\napologise was sent in. Before the\nU GM she wrote a letter a polo gi sing. She claimed she \"borrowed\nthe equipment lor someone I knew to be responsible\". She now\nsays that as Deputy President, she\ncan take any club's equipment, and\npresumably do what she likes\nwith it. Who pays lor any\ndamage? It would seem to be\nonly fair that il any club's equipment has to be repaired\nafter she has borrowed it, she\nshould pay lor it herself. This\nmatter also raises the point, can\nshe take equipment, even if the\nclub concerned doesn't want her\nto? The slimy way in which Ms\nSnee has behaved does not\nendear her to me.\nPerhaps Mr Marshall does an\nhonourable thing when he is\nasked to apologise. Instead of\na polo gi sing he tries to make I he-situation worse. On reflection, I think he is the only other noble\nand upright person at IC (the\nli rst is my s eli). In fact I would\ncertainly give him my support \u2014\nshould he need one.\nPettifogger Jarnoyce BSc\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Steve\nWith reference to the recent\nU GM concerning Dare Afolabi\nand FELIX. Being one of the\nmany students at IC who does\nnot comprehend the workings of\nan UG M,I feel it necessary to\nwrite to FELIX expressing the\nviews of, I suspect, many persons\nat IC.\n1. People find the contents of\nFELIX, in general, interesting\nand amusing.\n2. Most people, including I suspect Dare Afolabi, find it\namusing to see how many names\nbeginning with the letter 'D' that\nSteve Marshall can think of, or\nindeed get into one sentence.\n3. It is entirely up to the\nEditor as to the exact content of\nFELIX, this includes any editing\nas he sees suitable.\n4. The Editor should be\nspecifically barred from including any material which by its\nnature is liable to cause racial or\nsexual tension.\nIn summary, I feel we should\nrequire a full and complete\napology from Mr Marshall for his\ninclusion of certain material in\nFELIX566 and in return offer a complete vote of confidence in\nhim as FELIX Editor . . . and let\nthe matter be ended.\nTours\nPhil Webb\nMech Eng 3\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Mr Marshall \u2022\nYour methods of distortion\nand manipulation of information\n(which is what every non-fascist\nwho attended the College U GM of December 2, 1980 will agree is\nyour definition of \" editing\") would certainly have filled Adolf\nHitler's propaganda coordinators\nwith envy. Carry on editing \"for\nthe neighbourhood\".\nSincerely\nJ Kamalu\nMetallurgy Dept\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir\nThe Third Year Genetic Engineering practical class\nreached the wrong result. The\nwrong result, however, was really\nquite pleased to reside in\nBiochemistry lor the rest of its\nnatural days.\nTours\nDr Gloover\nI'S: Mussolini liked to rut with\nsweaty women, any offers?\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nSir\nSection 2.1 of the FELIX Constitution states: \"The object\nof the paper shall be to communicate the views and opinions of\nstudents at IC (in terms of\ndecisions taken at UGMs . . .) to its\nreaders\". It appears from last\nweek's FELIX as if no decisions\nwere taken at the U GM concerning the motion on the FELIX Editor, since none was \"communicated\" to the readers by your\nreport. If decisions were indeed\ntaken on the motion, may we\nknow why you did not inform us\nof them?\nTours faithfully\nZia Janjua\nChem Eng PG Merry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir\nYour current campaign against\nMr Mooney is disgraceful.\nYou obviously think it is in\ngood taste to malign the character\nof this much loved man by\nprinting opinions abut him that\nhave no basis in fact. As an\nexample of this, he was called\n\"the most hated man at IC\"; whereas everyone knows that\nCapt Lindley is the most hated\nman at IC.\nDespite the fact that he has\nbeen in the catering trade for\nthirty-two years, you seem to\nbelieve that he can't run the\nkitchens properly or produce\nexcellent food. This is rubbish,\nhis food is so good, that even the\nPress Secretary of the Duke of\nEdinburgh Award Scheme said\nthe food was \"excellent\" and\noffered her congratulations to\nCollege on having such a superb\ncaterer. Yes, Mooney food is\ntruly lit for a king.\nInstead of congratulating him,\nyou continually print BB Wolfle's actionable comments about he\nperils of eating 'Mooney'. Do you\nimagine that if students don't like\nMr Mooney's tasty and nourishing food, then they can't cook lor\nthemselves.\nTo cap it all you printed that\ninterview in which it was alleged\nby Mr Mooney that the kitchens\nand bars were fumigated weekly,\nthe staff are bad, he is fat, food is\nheated up and kept from lunchtimes to evenings, and there are\nodd dishes that they fall down on.\nWhilst it is well known that all\nthe above arc true, il is surely in\nthe worst tradition ol sensational\njournalism to print them.\nGerry Adams\nPhysics I Merry Christmas - Ed\nDear Editor\nAn appeal to Union members:\nStop attacking Union Officers in\nFELIX, it docs no good, they\ncan't read, and start vilifying\nyour lecturers.

No company has received\nofficial permission to do so. Any approaches\nshould be treated with extreme caution and\nshould be reported to the warden or sub-warden\nimmediately.

Ha!\nHa! Ho! Ho!

The\noverall picture is that everyone should be getting\nthe equivalent of what they are getting now,\nwhich makes NUS and their 11,000 marchers\nlook pretty silly.\nNearer home, the estimates for next year will\nhave to be prepared pretty soon after Christmas,\nso aD club and society chairmen please start\nthinking about it now.\nCleaners Cupboard\nI was surprised to read in last week's FELIX that\nSherfield Security think I 've got the key to the\nJCR Cleaning Cupbaord, as I most certainly have\nnot, and indeed wasn't aware that it was missing\nas neither security nor anyone using the room\nhad reported it.

We arrived late after\nmidnight at Snowdon Ranger Youth Hostel and\non the Saturday we went up Snowdon, eagerly\nek x pectin ga magnificent panorama from the top\n(very rare), as the sky was reasonably clear. The\nweather, however, having sensed our hopes, saw\nfit to lower cloud, before most of us had arrived;\nand not until we were on the way down did it\ndisappear.\nThe second day we went to Llyn Ogwen where\nwe separated into three groups. The first group\nwent up to Devil's Kitchen, Glyder Fawr (999m), Glyder Fach (994m); the second group did some\nrock climbing near Llyn Idwal and the third group\nwalked a rou in d the lower slopes of Llyn Ogwen.\nThe wether remained cold but dry over the\nweekend and the hostel and the food (which we\ncooked ourselves) were great.\nAll the weekends have been thoroughly\nenjoyed by those involved, and have included this\nterm places like the Peak District, Brecon\nBeacons in South Wales, the Downs and a successful cycling weekend in East Essex. Also\nthe large numbers wishing to go k on weekends\nhas kept the prices very reasonable.\nA week ago we had our annual Christmas\nDinenr at the Carvery in the Rembrandt Hotel,\nwhich went very well, and at the last but ty meeting the weekends for next term were\ndecided.

The games was a somewhat scruffy affair\nwith few dangerous attacks mounted by\neither side and IC were perhaps rather\nfortunate to score the vital first goal. It was\nElliot who scored after sneaking behind the\nGoldsmiths defence to meet a careful cross\nfrom Reeve and slot the ball inside the far\npost.\nThe second half saw a much more open\ngame which allowed the new front line\nformation to combine well. Dean headed on\nto Hartland who calmly slipped his shot past\nthe keeper. From then on IC were in complete\ncontrol with many attacks stemming from the\npotent Smith-Elliot partnership on the left.\nThe third goal came with Dean shooting\nunder pressure after being well led by\nRowley.\nSoon afterwards Hartland intercepted a tepid back pass and scored his second goal\ngiving IC a comfortable 4-0 lead. Goldsmiths\ndidn't give up and were awarded a penalty\nafter Smith brought down a member of\nGoldsmiths strike-force. Organowski dived to\nhis left and saved the well struck penalty.\nTEAM: Organowski, Reeve, Smith, Mulhall,\nWard, Bateron, Elliot/Dick, Dean, Hartland,\nRowley.\nFootballSeconds\nThis match saw the welcome return of\nGraham Rickard to IC soccer, after an injury\nwhich he incurred during the trials at the start\nof the season.\nEarly IC pressure paid off when Martin\nCurran broke through a massed defence and\ndelicately chipped the keeper. Rickard was\nquickly back in form when he scored the first\nof his three goals with a typical diagonal run\nacross the penalty area followed by a shot\njust inside the post.\nA determined Goldsmith's midfield fought\nback, however and produced a couple of\nscores in the IC defence with one shot\nrapping against the post. Another good\nforward run by Martin Curran made the score\n3-0 for IC when his hard low shot found the\ncorner of the net.\nAfter the break, Goldsmiths attacked with\nmore purpose and a curling shot was unlucky\nto hit the bar. The resulting corner was not\ncleanly cleared and a close range shot made\nthe score 3-1. IC immediately replied with\nPage 10 FELIX, December 12, 1980\n\n"

In addition, for the person who gets the most\npuzzles right, there is a cash prize of \u00a32 plus a \u00a310\nvoucher redeemable at the Victoria Bicycle\nCompany in Pimlico Road. We are very grateful to the\nmanagers for donating this prize.\nThe unmarked puzzles are much easier than my\nusual weekly offering. They are just for Christmas\nentertainment (for those with warped minds) and can all\nbe solved without recourse to a calculator. Answers are\non page eight (with the answer to last week's puzzle)\nbut try not to cheat till you've spent at least fifteen\nminutes on each.\nAll but one of the puzzles so far have been original,\nbut to ensure some really ingenious stuff for the holiday\nI have adapted a few of my favourites from other\nsetters. Hopefully I have covered my tracks well\nenough to prevent any solvers recognising the sources,\nwhich are pretty obscure anyway.\nI am particularly grateful to my friend Grey Spider\nfor the beautiful chess puzzle.

It seems the monks are under a vow of silence\nwhich prohibits them from saying anything unless it is\nabsolutely necessary; talking to auditors, I discovered, is\nnot.\nStill ^ the\nnot.\nStill, I have been making progress. I was in the\ndevotional aids shop this morning, and as I was trying to\nremember the difference between a hassock and a cassock, six monks entered the shop.\n\"One candle each,\" said one of them, curtly. \"AH\ndifferent sizes.\" Not another word was spoken as each of\nthem in turn handed the shopkeeper \u00a3.1 and was given a candle and a different amount of change.\nFor a moment I was puzzled as to how the shopkeeper\nknew which monk wanted which size candle. But as soon\nas I had worked this out. I dashed to the till and counted\nthe contents. One quick calculation later, I knew that\nthe six had just taken the total of \u00a3.1.66 in change, so I was able to deduce the price of each candle.\nHow much are the six different sizes of candle?\n- \u00ab i me dark\nAt the moment I am in the darkroom about to do some\ndeveloping, but there is light-sensitive material all around me, so to find out what a storage jar contains, I have to look at the label with a torch, while covered\nwith a blanket.\nNow three chemicals are needed to develop films:\ndeveloper, stop and fixer. In the darkroom there are\nnine jars, three of each chemical stored on three\nshelves, with three jars to a shelf.\nUnfortunately darkroom users are rather lax about\nputting each jar back on its proper shelf, so that although\nyou can always be sure that each shelf holds three\njars, you cannot tell what the jars contain without\nreading the labels.\nNevertheless, I have ascertained from the previous\ndarkroom user that there is a jar of developer on each\nshelf, but no fixer on the top shelf. More than that he\ncouldn't remember.\nHow many jars must I inspect under the blanket to find\none of each chemical?\n/ \u00ab % \u2022 ; . . h \u00b0seQ fU: a seasonal\n<ce reindeer; each of\n.ne, a different>ob, sings a j caro/, drinks a different drink, a different co four nose,\ni deer if ho/ i//s Santa' s sack sings 'Wfii/e Watched'.

First year UG s, as in\nprevious years, find his lecturing\nstyle so dull, and the monotonous\ntone of his voice so conducive to\nreading FELIX in the Common\nRoom on Friday mornings, that\nattendance at his weekly lecture\nis currently decreasing exponentially with time. As for those\ncreeps who go to his problem\nclass \u2014 huh!\nK Barry\nPS: Mr Reuter Departmental\nHead, still hasn't got his PhD.\nHe'd better get a move on if he\nwants one before retirement age.\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir\nC Parnells behaviour in a Life\nScience tutorial group this term\nwas so bad that I wish to tell the\nrest of IC how much I detest him.\nHe continually does all the\nproblem sheets and shows the rest\nof the group up. I speak for the\nrest of the group when I ask for\nthis trend to stop \u2014 or for him to\nshow his answers to us before the\ntutorial.\nW Tone\nLife Sci 1\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nSir\nAt this time of the year\nreflection and evaluation preoccupy the thoughts of most of\nthe populace. Here at IC I think\nit is time we examined the\nperformance of those we elected\nto office at the last sabbatical\nelections. If this motley charade\nwas aTV series it would be\nmildly jocular, however, it is not\na series and it is not funny. Let us\nexamine the ignoble assembly of\nciphers and rubber stamps.\nThe ICU President, Mr John\n' Pi st more' Passmore's most\nmemorable action has been to\nwaste \u00a3500 of Union funds on a disaster that can only be regarded\nas Titanic. This recalls the\nChurchillian phrase \"Never has\nso much been owed to so many\nby so few\" (s homem ishta kc here\nshu rely). His quick return after\nthe kidnap was very illuminating\nas it transpired that they had got\nthe wrong man; some would say\n\"so have we\".\nIt would be nice to have a good\nword to say about our sherry\nslurping Deputy President, Ms\nRae Snee. She has postured for\nfar too long resting merely on\nthe lustre of the position and not\non any noticeable work rate. She\nis i he anonymous member of the\nExec content to surround herself\nwith the benighted hacks of\nRC'.SU. Any member of Council\nwill have seen at close hand her\nbasic lack of knowledge of ICU Standing Orders and procedure.\nShe lias the reputation in FELIX of \"not knowing\" more than any\nother Union Officer; her most\nfrequent quotable statement\nbeing \" O h,I'm not sure\".\nMiss Liz Lindsay recovered\nwell from her initial demise of\norganising one of the most poorly\nattended Freshers' UG Ms in\npost-War ICU history. In fact,\nher recovery to last week's attendance of six hundred is\nl audible. However, her general\ndemean our is either one of\npatronising good humour or\nabusive intolerance.\nLast and least is the FELIX Editor whose lack of Christmas\ncopy is forcing me to write this\ncatalogue of wasted time. He is\nquoted as saying he only really\nenjoyed the first issue. Indeed,\nwho are we k as mere students to\ndisagree?\nIt is thus clear to me that we\nelected to office a questionable\nrabble that almost approach in\nintellectual corn pet ance lukewarm BULLSHIT! I would be\nthe last to indulge in mudslinging\nand pointless criticism, so in view\nthen of similar criticism of the\nExec by the other 4499 students\nat IC I think that something must\nbe done. Indeed, the Exec must\nnot only apologise for their crass\nmishandling of Union affairs but\nfor their very existence.\nAs for the FELIX Editor not\nonly has he the habits and\nstandards of personal hygiene of\nan Aardvark with intestinal\nparasites, but apa ent ly wears its\nold clothes.\nTours in mould e ring disgust'\nStephen Goulder\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nDear Sir\nI would like to complain about\nthe abundance of harsh, unconstructive criticism 'gracing' if I may use so refined a term, the\nletters page of FELIX. Surely the\nwriters of these vile character\nassassinations are nothing more\nthan frustrated, useless, mindless,\njelly-live red, pox-ridden vermin,\nand rather than be allocated\nspace on the letters page to\nspread their putrescent propaganda they should be forced to\ncrawl back to the slimy flea-ridden worm hoi es whence they\ncame.\nTours etc\nDave Jago\nMerry Christmas - Ed\nSir,\nI must protest most strongly\nabout the way FELIX treated\nthe motion casting as pert ions on\nthe Editor. Making non sence out of such a carefully worded\nmotion that so damn ingly condemned you should not be\npermitted at UG Ms. Furthermore, I can find no trace of a FELIX orator in the FELIX Constitution. I think you owe\nthose at the U GM an apology\nfor expressing your views.\nR Emmet\nMaths PG Merry Christmas - Ed.\nCouncil\nReport\nTHE MAIN POINT of the\nPresident's report was the policy\ndecision over places in Halls of\nResidence. He said that Don\nMunro had agreed to let all third\nyear first applicants get into Hall\nin the 1981/2 session and after\nthat College will be able to\nguarantee at least one year in\nHall. In addition, as the\nnumbers of overseas students\ncontinues to fall there will be\nmore room for postgraduates,\nmarried students andre applicants. John further reported\non the amicable discussion\nbetween Rhodes Boyson, Rae\nSnee and himself at the DES and\nthat student financing will be\nguaranteed nationally via a central payment to the University\nGrants Commission to which the\nUniversity sends its claims for\nfunds which the institution\nconcerned pays a grant to its\nstudent union. John also clarified\nhis position over the SwintertonDyer controversy.\nAt Governing Body the idea\nthat Imperial College should\nbecome independent of London\nUniversity and form a separate\nuniversity possibly along with\nQE C and Chelsea will be dis-cussed.\nLiz reported that the IN COST Conference will take place after\nall as there are fifty delegates\ncommitted to coming.\nThe absence of the P WP Chairman meant that his report\nwas referred to the next Council\nmeeting.\nChaplaincy\nAccusation\nCHI RHO, the magazine of the\nWest London Chaplaincy, not\nnoted for its controversial stories\ncontained some rather contentious material in its issue of December\n7, 1980. The magazine contained\nthis rather unusual sentence\nrefer ing to the passage of the\nmotions at the last ICU UG M:\"I hope Chaplaincy members\nwill turn out in force, and bring\npeople along to the Union Meetings next term to defend\nthese resolutions from reactionary\nalliances of Mines and the\nLiberal Club\".\nMembers of the Liberal Club\napproached were astonished that\nthey should be label lcd reactionary\nwhereas there was no mention of\nConsoc despite the fact that two\nof its prom in ant members spoke\nin the debate. The statement that\nthere was any alliance was\n' confirmed by a member as\n\"having no substance\".\nFred Sanger\natl CDR FRED SANGER one of the\njoint winners of the 1980 Nobel\nPrize for Chemistry and Nobel\nLaureate of 1958 spoke to a packed lecture theatre last\nThursday. He was fulfilling a commitment he made before\nknowing he had won the Nobel\nprize, even though he was to\nreceive the award in Stockholm\non Monday, December 8.\nThe lecture he gave was almost\nidentical to that which he gave in\nStockholm containing results\nthat were unpublished and which\nare of fundamental importance\nin the field of molecular genetics.\nHe began the lecture by\noutlining the method of sequencing DNA( Deoxyribose Nucleic\nAcid) developed by him at the\nMRC Molecular Biology Laboratory in Cambridge. Before it was\ndeveloped, he said, it could take\nnearly a year to sequence a stretch of five hundred bases\nsimply by partial enzymatic\ndigestion. The method he pioneered was the + - technique\nwhich is based not on de grc dati on but upon the synthesis of a complementary strand of DNA( c DNA). To obtain a sufficient\namount of DNA to sequence the\nmost modern methods of genetic\nmanipulation are used. The desired fragment of DNA is\nexcised using specific restriction\nend on uc leases, the fragment is\nthen inserted into a viral DNA and the virus is then left to\nreplicate.\nHe then discussed his work on\nthe human mitochondria, a subcellular organelle with its own\nDNA. He showed that his results\nindicated that the coding of the\ngenetic information is unlike an v known prokaryote or eukaryote.\nIt contained the first known\nvariation in the code with a codon previously only known as\nstopping transcription coding for\nan amino acid.\nIn dealing with questions he\ndisplayed genuine courtesy and\nwas very frank in his answers. He\nsat down to prolonged applause\nfrom an appreciative audience.\nAnother Gong\nfor Bill\nMR BILL WEST has flown off to\nParis to receive another medal\nfrom the Polish government in\nExile. Bill, a College maintenance\ntechnician and Pearly King has\nalready received decorations for\n\"ou standing bravery\" in the last\nwar. The Polish Prime Minister\nin Exile is presenting Bill with the\nOfficers Cross of the Order of the\nPolomia Restituta.

    "content": "NOT QUITE JERUSALEM WHAT MAKES PEOPLE volunteer to go on a kibbutz? Are they just after a holiday with a difference? Are they running or hiding? In\nhis first play, Paul Kember throws together a hot ch pot ch of misfits and puts them in a kibbutz somewhere near the Gaza Strip.\nWhat transpires is a play which asks a lot of\nquestions about motivation and the class system, but fails to give a satisfactory answer. It leaves\none feeling angry, but unsure of who to direct\nthis anger against. Mr Kember would have us\nbelieve that the 'English Disease' is due to the\nclass structure of our society. The workers feel\nthat they don't control their own destiny, but\nare not well educated enough to do anything\nabout it.\nSome of the characters are rather obvious\nstereotypes, especially the two women. The fanta s ising pseudo-intellectual Carrie is very\nunderdeveloped and Gila provides love\ninterest. The main dialogue and mature analysis comes in interplay between Mike, a disgruntled Cambridge dropout, who found\nand rejected 'Englishmen', and Ami, the co\nor d in at or of Volunteers Day.\nIn 'Volunteers Day' the volunteers have to\nshow the kibbutz nik s something of their\nculture. All the other national contingents\ndiligently prepare a piece, the English do\nnothing. This it is asserted is typically English.\nWhy are the other nationalities enthusiastic to\ndisplay their country's culture? Are they well\neducated and always consulted at every stage\nof the decision-making process? Are they\nhappy members of a classless society? No, they are merely used as background to\nhighlight the apathy of the English.\nTheir attitude is compared to that of the\ntireless kibbutz nik s living in a socialist Utopia. This is due not to the merits of the system, but the merits of the kibbutz. It is an isolated\nmicrocosm, insensitive to the demands of\ncentral government. The Israel of Tel Aviv,\nfree from Zionistic zealand the pioneer spirit\n\u2022 is just as corrupt and insensitive as any other\ncountry with the additional burden of high taxation and galloping inflation.\nIn the kibbutz they take turns. However,\ntheir society is one of stability. This stability is\nenforced as a means of survival, against the desert, and against the Arabs who's desert it\nused to be. Anyone who doesn't fit is thrown\nout.\nIf one leaves aside the rather pretentious\nexamination of class struggle and systems of\ngovernment, one is left with some good dialogue, with a stylish performance by Philip\nDavies as the college dropout. He is rarely off-stage, which is probably just as well. There is a good cameo performance by Leslee Udwin.\nShe portrays the self confident S abra, disdainful of all other lifestyles. Wr on q is not a word she understands. The Royal Court Theatre is in Sloane Square and the play runs until January 13.\nLee Paddon\nCertificate A. Starring Sam Jones Melody Anderson, Max Von Sydow and\nChaim To pol. Directed by Michael Hodges. Now showing at ABC' s Fulham\nRd and Shaftesbury Avenue, general\nrelease from Sunday.\nFamily films are all to rare nowadays and this version of Alex\nRaymond's serial Flash Gordon must certainly rank as one of the most\nwidely appealing ever. Despite a myriad of shortcomings it is,\nnonetheless, entertaining.\nThe opening sequence shows the fingers of an evil figure passing over\nseveral buttons on a monitor which shows the planet Earth. He chuckles\ndeeply and presses \"Earthquake\", then \"Hot Hail\", and so on. This\nfigure, for better or worse, is Ming the Merciless, evil ruler of the planet\nMongo using a power beam so that the Earth will be destroyed in no time\nNeedless to say football hero Flash Gordon and his latest a quaint ance Dale\nArden crash land into the house of crazed\nex-NASA scientist Hans Zarkov, who is the\nonly person who has spotted this bit of\ntrouble and has a handy spaceship lying\naround. If that sounds improbable, then wait\nthere is more. Zarkov draws a gun on his lab\nassistant-\"I need help to take off\", he says.\n\"Just grab your toothbrush and a few things.\"\nThe assistant flees, but Flash and Dale replace\nhim with the necessary aid. \"Keep your foot on\nthat big red pedal,\" Zarkov bleats on lift-off.\nTheir destination is Mongo, where Ming and\nhis thugs have a reign of tyranny over several\nkingdoms; the cold world Frigia, the forest\nkingdom of Arboria, the Hawken's sky city and\nso on. As is expected, Flash manages to enlist\nthe aid of Prince Barin of Arboria and Vultan\n(Brian Blessed), leader of the Hawkmen, to\ndefeat Ming. He also manages to escape\ncertain death at least five times and have a bit\non the side with Ming's daughter Aura \u2014 all\nwithin about twelve hours. Some man.\nProducer Dino de Laurentis has obviously\nchosen this to be a homage to the original film\nserial, started in 1936. I must admit to being a keen special effects fan and, quite frankly, in\nthis case they are abysmal; spaceships become\ntransparent (revealing some of the beautifully\ncoloured sky s* and the models used are in\nparallel with the1936 version. The Hawkmen's wings flap pathetically and perspectives are\nlost all over the place. Worst of all Ming's city\nresembles 5. model kit spilled onto the floor\nand Vultan's sky city is laughably plastic.\nHowever, despite this, the mixture of bright\ncolours and alien designs is somehow in\ncharacter. After all Raymond's strip never\nlooked convincing, merely exciting and\nimaginative.\nThe acting,, again, is laughable at times \u2014\nSam Jones stars as the ail-American hero and\nbarely rises to mediocrity, Melody Anderson's Dale is only a little better and Topol plays it all\nthe way for laughs as Zarkov. The only striking\npiece is from Max von Sydow who is a truly\ndetestable Ming. As an aside the screenplay is\nby Lorenzo Semple Jr, who scripted the\nBatman series and movie, which may explain\nmany of the hilarious lines mouthed by the\nFlash and Dale in particular (the dynamic\nduo?).\nAs to the i rr ever and, tongue-in-cheek style I can only say that hardened SF fans will\nprobably cringe, but most people will reel with\nlaughter at patches of awfulness. My greatest\nworry is that Dr Who did many similar things\nlong ago and at a fraction of the cost. I also\nhope that I am right in thinking that the film\nwas made like this deliberately.\nMark Smith\nFELIX, December 12, 1980 Page 9\n\n"

Now\nis the time to start planning for 1982/3, even for\nthose with relatively simple objectives.\nSome of the above sound formidable, but with\nthe help of the huge amount of experience and\nthe numerous contacts that exist in and outside\nthe College (at the Royal Geographical Society\nand British Museum for instance) they are within\nanyone's capabilities.\nSubstantial backing as well as fia nanci al help is\navailable from the Exploration Board for\n'expeditions' in the widest possible sense of the\nword. The opportunities range from those\ninvolving scientific and engineering orientated\nprojects (e.g. environmental studies, hydrology\nand communications) to those wanting to climb,\ncave, carry out underwater salvage work or just\nto undertake a difficult journey.\nFor next term we intend to organise several\nmeetings concentrating in turn on some of the\nplaces mentioned. There will be speakers with\npersonal experience to the country, able to give,\nan inter sting talk with good slides, as well as'\nsuggest the sort of thing a student expedition\nmight undertake, outline the problems and\nanswer questions.\nAnyone with ideas, experience, specialist\nknowledge or just plain interested please come\nalong. Hopefully these meetings will provide the\nseed for one or two expeditions. It will be a worthwhile development if some mufti disciplinary expeditions can be formed from those in different\nyears and on different courses.\nTake China for instance \u2014 a feasible\nproposition considering the links the College has.\nAn attempt was made two years back and\nconsiderable progress achieved. However, it\nfoundered since the leader left for Hong Kong \u2014\nin theory to gain information \u2014 but was so\nenticed he stayed. So, why not try again? The first,\nstudent expedition ever to China!\nIf you have any ideas in the meantime, go ahead\nand follow them up. You can contact me,\nchairman of the Explorataion Society, through\nthe Mech Eng 1 pigeon-holes.\nMax Balfour\nScaramouche\nSolutions\nLast Week's Solution\nOn the face of it, White appears to have a valid\nmate in two by 1 N B6. Whatever Black replies,\nthen White mates with 2 R R8.\nHowever, if Black can castle, she can avoid this\nmate.\nNow by the rules of chess, Black cannot castle\nif she has moved her king or rook. So if she can\ncastle what was her last move? Not with the pawn\non KN2, certainly, for this pawn hasn't moved. So\nit must have been with the pawn on QN4. This\npawn cannot have come from QN3, or else White\nillegally left herself in check at the end of her\nprevious move. Nor can it have come from QB3\n(capturing) since White still has all sixteen men.\n(A lot of otherwise complete entries missed this\npoint.) So Black's last move was P( N2)-N4 which\nallows 1 PxP en passant, check. The rules forbid\ncastling out of check, so 1... K Ql is forced, and\nmate follows with 2 P K7.\nSo there are alternative solutions, depending\non Black's last move. If Black played P( N2)-N4,\nWhite should play PxP en passant, whereas if\nBlack moved king or rook last, then White should\nplay N B6.\nOut of forty-five entries, six were absolutely\ncorrect and the winner is Jeremy Moss,\nChemistry 1, who can collect his prize from the\nFEUX Office.\nCount Scaramouche\nConsider the number of ways of spelling\nEHCUOMARACS in one quarter of the diagram.\nThere is only one choice of E. From that E you\nhave a choice of two Hs, and from each H you\nhave a choice of two Cs... etc.\nSo EHCUOMARACS can be spelled out in 2\">\nways. So SCARAMOUCHE can be spelled in the\nsame number of ways. So taking all four quarters\nof the diagram into consideration; there are 4.210\nways, except that the four 'straight' spells have\neach been counted twice. Hence there are 4.210\n-4=4092 ways to read SCARAMOUCHE in the\ndiamond.\nCubes\nSince 3S+7^K)3=370, itis obvious that 33\n+73\n+l3=371. Shot in the Dark\nFour.\nInspect a jar from the middle shelf. If it's fixer,\ninspect all the jars from the top shelf. If it's stop,\ninspect the other two jars from the middle shelf.\nBut if it's developer, you must inspect another\njar from the middle shelf. If this is stop, take the\nremaining jar from the middle shelf. If it's developer, then inspect two jars from the top\nshelf.\nA little thought will convince you that this\nmethod will always provide you with at least one\njar of each chemical.\nBathtime\nNeither; the clear patch is still exactly the right\nsize (half the size of your face).\nCockroach Vol-au-Vent\nJohn and Rae cross together. John brings the\ntorch back. Steve and Liz cross together. Rae\nbrings the torch back. John and Rae cross\ntogether. Total time: 12 minutes.\nTrousers\nZero.
