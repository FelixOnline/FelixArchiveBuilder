Brunch (not only for weekends) is the answer, and we\u2019ve rounded up all our favourite spots around\ncampus...\nFOOD\nJulia Dabrowska\nFood Editor\nW\nhat comes\nto mind\nwhen you\nsee the word\n\u2018brunch\u2019? Probably a\nbunchofmillennialseating\ncrunchy avocado toast,\nInsta-worthy smoothie\na\u00e7ai bowls or stacks of\nwarm waffles (drizzled\nwith maple syrup and\ntopped with fresh summer\nberries of course), and all\nof this costing you lots\nand lots of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.\nAlthough that may be\na part of it, brunch can\nalso be a nice treat for you\nand your friends to enjoy\non any day of the week,\n(right before that boooring\nlecture) and super close\nto campus as well! We\ntherefore present you 3\nplaces to have brunch near\ncampus, all no more than\nan 8 minute walk away\nfrom campus!\nMuriel\u2019s Kitchen\nLocated just outside\nSouth Ken station, this\nplace is always hustling\nand bustling (what better\nmarker of a food venue\u2019s\npopularity, right?), and\nafter peeking in and\nseeing the delicious plate\nof croissants that was\nbeing consumed at the\ncute marble-style tables,\nI knew I had to go in\nand try it. Judging by the\nyouthful presence, I was\nsure that the food served\nhere was not your simple\nbrunch. I was right \u2013\nMuriel\u2019s Kitchen provides\neverything you could\nwant for brunch with a\nmodern twist. Particular\nthings that caught my eye\nincluded The Ultimate\nEggs Royale, Banana &\nRicotta Pancakes, and\nthe omnipresent Buddha\nBowl which I ended up\nordering and very much\nenjoying (is it me, or are\nthey absolutely every-where?!).\nAnd don\u2019t worry about\ndrinks \u2013 from their classic\nice cream milkshakes\n\u201cI was sure\nthat the food\nserved here\nwas not your\naverage simple\nbrunch. I was\nright...\u201d\n\u201cBest of all, all\nthe breakfast\nfoods fall in\nthe price range\nof \u00a34.20 - \u00a38.00\n- win-win!\u201d\nand fresh juices to more\nunique beverages such as\nthe turmeric latte, you\u2019ll\nsurely find something to\ncomplement your meal.\nThe counter also has an\narray of warm, freshly\nbaked homemade cakes,\nincluding banana bread,\nNutella cake or their\nspecial carrot cake. Prices\nrange from \u00a32.30 for a\npastry with spreads to\n\u00a312.50 for a Full English\n\u2013 by brunch standards,\npretty good. (Oh, and if\nyou\u2019re interested in all\nthat basic bitch stuff, they\ndo a lovely afternoon tea\ntoo!)\nBrown & Rosie\nWalking past Brown\n& Rosie on my many,\nmany trips to campus\n(skipping lectures is of\ncourse not recommended\nby Felix Food editors\u2026\nunless they\u2019re 9ams), I\nwas always fascinated\nby the classy but cute\nd\u00e9cor, not to mention\nthe mouth-watering food\nfrom their Instagram ads\nthat I\u2019ve been getting ever\nsince I once liked a post\nmarked #brunch (GDPR\nanyone?). On a lovely day\nlast week, I finally got the\nchance to see if the food\nlived up to the aesthetics.\nAgain, the variety was not\ndisappointing \u2013 apart from\nclassics such as French\ntoast or smoked salmon,\nyou can also find the\nsugary Coco Pop waffles\n(personally tried and\ntested \u2013 although extremely sweet, also extremely\nyummy!) or the healthier\ncourgette & corn fritters,\nif you so desire (new year\nnew me going strong?).\nThe taste was also lived\nup to the aesthetic \u2013 rich,\nwell-made and well, good.\nAlbeit priciest on our list,\nyou can find yourself a\nmeal for \u00a35.50 to \u00a312.90,\nand the portions are very\nfilling. The only things\nworth complaining about\nare the size of the venue,\nas it can get busy at times,\nand the semi-slow service\n\u2013 but the food is good\nenough to compensate, so\ndefinitely worth a visit.\nLe Pain Quotidien\nFinally, after having\ntried some less \u2018typical\u2019\nbrunch places, it was time\nto test a more popular\nvenue. Le Pain Quotidien,\nas the name suggests, (for\nthose of you who don\u2019t\nspeak French, t\u2019as pas\nhonte) is largely known\nfor its selection of fresh\nbread, pastries, sandwiches and all that kind of\nyummy carbs, in its chaincaf\u00e9-style locations, the\nnearest of which is located\njust a minute away from\nSouth Ken station (and\nactually opposite Brown\n& Rosie). Having heard a\nfriend raving about it after\nshe had eaten brunch there\njust recently, I thought\nit was worth a try. The\noutcome? Incredible.\nBesides their usual\neat-in omelette, eggs any\nstyle, smoothie bowl,\nor parfait options, you\ncan also order takeaway\nbagels, salmon and cream\ncheese tartine or even\navocado toast for when\nyou\u2019re rushed for time.\nYes, you read that right \u2013\ndelightful avocado toast\nwhich you can take away,\nall carefully packaged in a\nbox so you can eat it in the\nback of the lecture theatre\n(if you manage to make\nit last those 7 minutes\nof walking). Best of all,\nWthe breakfast foods fall\nin the price range of \u00a34.20\nto \u00a38.00 \u2013 win win!\nThe lowdown?\nAlthough the food is\nthe simplest in LPQ, it\ndefinitely takes the gold\nin terms of affordabil-ity and ease. If you\u2019re\nlooking for something\na bit more original and\nInstagrammable (and you\nhave a bit more time), go\nfor Muriel\u2019s Kitchen or\nBrown & Rosie \u2013 they\u2019re\nworth it.\nNow let me enjoy my\nEggs Benedict in peace...\nSalmon and avocado brunch at Le Pain Quotidien // Julia Dabrowska\nBuddha Bowls at Muriel\u2019s Kitchen // Julia Dabrowska\n\n"

I suppose it says a\nlot that my inclination is to\nimagine it as an A-Level\nchemistry problem, but\nthat\u2019s Imperial for you. I\nalways knew that therapy\nwould be hard, and adjusting to life after therapy\nwould be difficult, but I\nwasn\u2019t prepared when I\nwas knocked by a death in\nthe family. I was so sure I\nwas winning the war until\nI turned my back to focus\non something else.\nThe enemy came into\nmy territory, and I retreated back to the restriction I\nknew best. For a while it\nwas almost nostalgic, the\nfamiliar hazy head of starvation dulled my sadness\nand made the grief softer;\nthe same purpose it has\nserved for my anxiety and\ncomplacent. Skipping\nbreakfast here and there\ndidn\u2019t feel dangerous,\nI was using the logic:\n\u201cHealthy people do that all\nthe time and I\u2019m healthy\nnow too!\u201d. It turns out\nthat all I was doing was\ntempting the beast to rear\nit\u2019s ugly head.\nEveryone around me\ngot used to me being okay\ntoo, so the thought of\ncoming clean about this\nis terrifying.

Logically I know\nthat none of these things\nare related to being fat.\nThe fact that I am far from\nany definition of fat is\nbesides the point. I am also\nwary of people pitying\nme, or being repelled by\nmy absurdity.

In\na week which\nsaw Shamima\nBegum's British citizenship revoked, Jussie\nSmollet charged with\nbeating himself up and\nother quite big stories\nin the mainstream News\nand media, it's been a\nsurprisingly quiet News\nweek for Felix. When I\nsay \"what a mess\" in the\ntitle of this Editorial,\nI am referring to the\nfront page story about\nthe decision to cut the\nevening bar food service at h-bar. It's a real\nshitshow and I'll get on\nto addressing that in due\ncourse. But first, my\nweek in review...\nThis week I had the\npleasure of starring as a\nguest on Felix Comment\nEditor and Social Boi,\nCharlie Titmuss' radio\nshow, \"Face for Radio\".\nSpecial shoutout to\nCharlie, I can't overstate\nhow much time, effort and\ndedication he puts in to\nhelping me get the paper\nout every week. As Social\nBoi, he is also instrumental in engendering a spirit\nof togetherness within the\nFelix Family. Anyway,\nCharlie has become one\nof my favourite people to\nhave a discussion with and\nmy guest slot on \"Face for\nRadio\" was an absolute\npleasure. I would invite\nhim on my own show, \"2\nGs in a Pod\" (shameless\nplug!) but he might not be\nqwhite the right fit for my\nshow.\nAnyway, on to the\nmess that is navigating\nthe levels of bureaucracy\nthat exist between the\nUnion and College. I\nmust admit, as I've said\nmany times before, for\nfour years here as an\nundergraduate student, I\ntook absolutely no interest\nin the Union or College.\nAs an employee here, I\ncan't say that has changed\nmuch. Although I am\nnaturally more involved\n2\nin the affairs of the Union\nand College, by virture of\nmy current role, there is\na clear misunderstanding\nthat is prevalent at all\nlevels of the management\nin both the College and\nthe Union. This misunderstanding is highlighted\nby the decision to cut the\nfood offering in h-bar. It is\nanother example of a decision being taken without\nstudent consultation and\nis indicative of the fact\nthat those making the\ndecisions continue to fail\nto realise that the university should prioritise the\ninterests of its staff and\nstudents above all else.\nThe manner in which the\ndecision was made - lack\nof student consultation,\ndiffering stories from both\nthe College and Union\nsides and (seemingly)\nunbeknownst to the sabbatical officers - is fankly\nunacceptable. The fact\nthat the sabbatical officers\nwere only made aware of\nthe decision a week before\nit was initially supposed\nto come into effect merely\nserves to further highlight the chasm between\nSMG and the Sabbs.\nFurthermore, it screams\nto me that College doesn't\nrespect the Sabbs as colleagues and equals when\nthe university's bottom\nline is in question. How\nare the Sabbs meant to\neffect meaningful change\nif they're not given a\nseat at the table (word\nto Solange) when decisions like this are made?\nAnyway, don't mind me.\nI just make my paper,\nsip my tea and mind my\nbusiness...\nSection of the Week\ngoes to the Arts Section.\nI crashed one of the Arts\nEditor socials and had a\nbrilliant time. It warms\nmy heart to see how much\nthey're enjoying working\non the paper and their\ndedication shines through\nwith yet another stellar\nweek for Arts! Congrats\nand thanks for saving me\nwith the extra pages\nthe elected Sabbatical\nofficers were not consulted prior to the decision\nbeing made and were\nonly notified on Friday\n8th\nFebruary, despite the\nobvious implications that\nsuch a decision will have\non the Union\u2019s drink\nsales. In a statement provided to Felix on behalf of\nImperial College Union,\nRob Tomkies (Union\nPresident), said:\n\u201cThe Union only\nreceived a week's notice\nthat the food service in\nh-bar was being cut by\nCollege. We are extremely\ndisappointed at the lack of\nany form of consultation\nor conversation with the\nUnion before this decision\nwas made. h-bar is one\nof the few specifically\na service to the Union that\nthey no longer say they\ncan afford.\u201d\nofficers were not privy\nto these discussions once\nagain highlights an apparent disconnect between\nthe College and the Union\nand, within the Union, a\nstark disconnect between\nthe sabbatical officers and\nthe Senior Management\nGroup (SMG) within the\nUnion.\nCollege has been\naccused of using its\n\u201cpower and wealth\nto destroy h-bar\u201d and\ndemonstrating \u201conce\nagain that it has absolutely\nno regard for the satisfaction of students and staff,\nand continues to act as a\nprofit-driven business,\nexploiting its students\u201d, to\nwhich Jane responded:\n\u201cQuite the opposite,\nI\u2019m trying to keep our bit\ngoing even though it\u2019s\ncosting us money. We do\na lot behind the scenes to\nhelp that service because\nI believe in it but, after\nthe supper finishes, it is a\nUnion space.\u201d\nJane continued, claiming that the following was\n\u201cIt's a\nuniversity -it should be\nrun in the\ninterests of the\nstudents, staff,\netc., not in\nthe interest of\nprofit\u201d\npostgraduate and staff\nsocial spaces on campus\nand, as such, the effect that\nthis will have on the community is unacceptable. In\nthe mean-time the Union\nis looking at how to minimise the impact of their\ndecision and ensure that\nh-bar remains a key part\nof the post graduate social\ncommunity. The bottom\nline is our postgraduates\nmake up half our mem-bership, we\u2019re committed\nto building our offering\nand how we support them\ngoing forward and we\u2019re\nnot going to let a College\ndecision unduly impact\nthat.\u201d\nSpeaking to Felix,\nJane Neary, Director of\nCampus Services in the\nCollege, responded to the\ncriticism, saying: \u201cThat\nservice is not a College\nservice, it\u2019s a service to\nthe Union to supplement\ntheir bar service; I\u2019ve axed\nput to the Union: \u201cWe\u2019re\nselling your product,\nthis product is now no\nlonger affordable. Do\nyou want to pay more\nfor this product, either by\ncharging the end-user, or\ndo you want to subsidise\nthe chef, because it\u2019s not\ncost-effective?\u201d\nThe decision was allegedly then taken following\nthe Union declining to\nmeet the College halfway.\nWhen questioned on\nwhy students were not\nengaged prior to the\ndecision being made,\nJane replied: \u201cBecause\nit wasn\u2019t our service.\nThe service wasn\u2019t to the\nstudents, the service was\nto the Union because it\nwas there to supplement\ntheir beer service. It\nwasn\u2019t a college service.\nThe college service is the\nsupper service.\u201d This response has been criticised\ndue to the perception that\nstopping the service to\nthe Union will, by exten-sion, ultimately deprive\nthe student body of said\nCollege settles bursary saga\nT\nhe 2015-2016\ncohort bursary\nscheme saga\nis coming to a\npatchy end, with affected students having been\ncontacted on Monday\n18th\nFebruary about new\navailable opportunities\nbeing funded.\nThe affected students\nwere notified of the opportunities that they would be\neligible for, funded by the\n\u00a3250,000 set aside by the\nCollege. These include\nUndergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programs\n(UROPs), Careers\nservices, and overseas\nelectives for medical\nstudents.\nHowever, this correspondence comes with\nalmost a month\u2019s delay\nfrom the initial announcement of the secured\n\u00a3250,000 funding during\nthe 22nd January Union\nCouncil meeting, adding\ninsult to injury to what\nhas been perceived as\nsub-standard management\nof the situation.\nThe Imperial Bursary,\nsettled by the College and\nthe Union two years prior\nto the entry of students\nreceiving them, is given\nto undergraduate home\nstudents with annual\nhousehold incomes of\nup to \u00a360,000. Because\nof a 2013 government\ndecision to make the\nNational Scholarship\nProgram unavailable to\nundergraduate students,\nthe bursary scheme for\nstudents entering in 2015\nsaw a \u00a3500,000 drop in\nfunding. The College and\nUnion decided to reduce\nthe financial support packages for students under\nthe \u00a335,000 - \u00a360,000\nincome bracket. However,\nin 2014, when the College\nand Union decided to\nincrease the bursary for\nstudents entering in 2016,\nthey overlooked any\nfurther reimbursement for\nthe 2015 cohort.\nThese \u201cunintended\nconsequences\u201d saw the\n2015 cohort left with less\nfunding than the cohorts\neither side of it; these students received lower bur-saries than those who had\nenrolled a year earlier and\na year later. According to\nthe 2018 Imperial College\nUnion Bursary Survey, the\nbursary was \u201cessential\u201d to\nthe living costs of 71% of\nrespondents, and to the\naccommodation costs of\n63% of respondents. The\n2015 bursary scheme is\nestimated to have effected\naround 200 undergraduate\nstudents. Many of these\nstudents have already\ngraduated or are in their\nfinal year, and the College\nhas come under criticism\nfor taking until now to\nreimburse their financial\nprovision.\nA member of staff\ncommented on the inadequate 2015-2016 bursary\nscheme management,\n\u201cI was mortified to read\nthe article on the student\nsupport packages that\nwere lower a few years\nago, and how the college\njust played the long game\nto obfuscate until most of\nthe affected students were\nout of the system. What\na piss weak way to deal\nwith mistakes. So often\nthe case at Imperial.\u201d\nservice.\nThe \"supper service\"\nrefers to the buffet service\nwhich is available from\n5-7pm and has been extended such that it is now\non offer from Monday to\nFriday. h-bar users are\nalso now allowed to bring\nany foods / get take away\ndelivered into the bar.\nDiscussions between\nthe Union and College\nare ongoing, in an attempt\nto arrive at a suitable\ncontingency plan until\nsomething more permanent can be agreed. It\nhas been suggested that\nthe Union could use the\nshared kitchen to provide\nImperial College Union\nfood at h-bar, which could\n\u201cmake the bar/restaurant\nthrive\u201d. This option is\nunder consideration.\nDisgruntled staff and\nstudents are being encouraged to sign a student-led\nonline petition attempting\nto overturn the decision\nprior to it coming into\neffect next Friday.\nJane also claims that\nthis decision should\ncome as no shock, given\nthat discussions between\nCollege and the Union\nhave been ongoing for the\npast eight months.

It can also\npredict what treatment\nwould be most effective\nfor patients following\ndiagnosis, paving the way\nfor more personalised\nmedicine.\nOvarian cancer is\nthe sixth most common\ncancer in women, with\n6,000 new cases every\nyear in the UK. However,\nthe long-term survival\nrate is just 35-40 per cent,\nas the disease is often only\ndiagnosed in later stages\nonce symptoms such as\nbloating are noticeable.\nProfessor Eric\nAboagye, lead author and\nProfessor of Cancer Pharmacology and Molecular\nImaging at Imperial, said:\n\u201cThere is an urgent\nneed to find new ways\nto treat the disease. Our\ntechnology is able to give\nclinicians more detailed\nand accurate information\non how patients are likely\nto respond to different\ntreatments, which could\nenable them to make\nbetter and more targeted\ntreatment decisions.\u201d\nDoctors currently\ndiagnose ovarian cancer\nin a number of ways:\nincluding a blood test to\nlook for a substance called\nCA125 \u2013 an indication of\ncancer - followed by a\nCT scan that uses x-rays\nand a computer to create\ndetailed pictures of the\novarian tumour. This\nhelps clinicians know\nhow far the disease has\nspread and determines the\ntype of treatment patients\nreceive, such as surgery\nand chemotherapy.\nHowever, the scans\ncannot give clinicians\ndetailed insight into\npatients\u2019 likely overall\noutcomes or the probable\neffect of a therapeutic\nintervention. The new\nsoftware aims to address\nthese problems.\nThe trial used a mathematical software tool\ncalled TEXLab to identify\nthe aggressiveness of\ntumours in CT scans and\ntissue samples from 364\nwomen with ovarian\ncancer between 2004 and\n2015. It examined four biological characteristics of\nthe tumours which significantly influence overall\nsurvival - structure,\nshape, size and genetic\nmakeup - to assess the\npatients\u2019 prognosis. The\npatients were then given a\nscore known as Radiomic\nPrognostic Vector (RPV)\nwhich indicates how\nsevere the disease is.\nThe researchers then\ncompared the results with\nblood tests and current\nprognostic scores used\nby doctors to estimate\nsurvival probability. They\nfound that the software\nwas up to four times more\naccurate for predicting\ndeaths from ovarian\ncancer than standard\nmethods.\nThe hope, therefore,\nis that the technology\ncan be used to stratify\novarian cancer patients\ninto groups based on the\nsubtle differences in the\ntexture of their cancer on\nCT scans, rather than classification based on what\ntype of cancer they have\nor how advanced it is.\nThe team also found\nthat five per cent of\npatients with high RPV\nscores had a life expect-ency of less than two\nyears. High RPV was also\nassociated with chemotherapy resistance and\npoor surgical outcomes,\nsuggesting that RPV can\nbe used as a potential\nbiomarker to predict how\npatients would respond to\ntreatments.\nThe researchers are\nalso planning to carry out\na larger study to see how\naccurately the software\ncan predict the outcomes\nof surgery and drug\ntherapies for individual\npatients, adding further\npowerful tools for doctors\nto use.\nLack of sleep is not necessarily fatal for flies\nNew research has found that the life expectency of flies are barely affected by sleep deprivation - could the same\nbe true for humans?\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Editor\nM\nale flies kept\nawake do not\ndie earlier\nthan those\nallowed to sleep, leading\nresearchers to question\nwhether sleep is essential\nfor staying alive. Whilst\nthis study was in flies,\nthe team speculate that\nif sleep is not essential\nfor life in the same way\nfood is, then it is possible\nthat their results could\napply across the animal\nkingdom - including in\nhumans.\nThey also found that\nfemale flies die on average\nonly three days earlier out\nof a 40-50 day average\nlifespan.\nDr Giorgio Gilestro,\nfrom the Department of\nLife Sciences at Imperial,\nsaid: \u201cFor food, we have\ncalories that are \u2018vital\u2019 to\nkeep us alive and calories\nthat are \u2018useful\u2019 to help us\nfunction well. It might be\nthat sleep is only \u2018useful\u2019:\nit would still be difficult\nfor us to function without\nit, but not necessarily\nfatal.\u201d\nPrevious experiments\nhave shown that some\nanimals die when deprived\nof sleep, but the studies\nare unclear about exactly\nwhy this is. The researchers behind the new study,\npublished in Science\nAdvances, suggest that\nthe way the experiments\nwere run could mean the\nanimals died of stress due\nto the methods of keeping\nthem awake.\nTo keep the flies awake,\nthe researchers kept each\nfly in a tube linked to an\nautomatic monitoring\nsystem. If the system\ndetected no movement for\n20 seconds, then the tube\nrotated, waking the fly\nup. This system allowed\nthe team to experiment\nwith hundreds of flies at\nonce, giving them a better\nunderstanding of the\naverage response to sleep\ndeprivation.\nThe researchers note\nthat while male flies did\nnot die earlier without\nsleep under lab conditions,\nin the wild lack of sleep\nwould cause knock-on\neffects that would put\nthem at greater risk from\npredators or competition.\nDr Gilestro added:\n\u201cLack of sleep could make\nit hard for them to function\nproperly and safely, just\nas a lack of sleep might\ncause a sleep-deprived\nhuman to crash their car.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that there are\nno consequences to not\nsleeping, but our study\nhas made us question\nwhether sleep deprivation\nalone causes death.\u201d\nDuring their exper-iments, the team also\nfound that, even while\nsleep deprived, the\nflies followed \u2018normal\u2019\npatterns of activity. Flies\nare usually more active at\ndawn and dusk, and even\nwhen they hadn\u2019t had any\nsleep for many days in a\nrow, this was still the case.\nThe researchers say this\nshows that the flies are not\nbuilding up a \u2018sleep debt\u2019they do not necessarily get\nsleepier the longer they\nstay awake, but keep to\nrelatively normal patterns\nof activity. This suggests\nthe pressure to sleep is\ncontrolled more strongly\nby the time or day than by\nthe amount of sleep taken.\nThis was further shown\nwhen flies that had been\ndeprived were allowed to\nsleep again. They slept\na little longer for a day\nor two but returned to\nnormal patterns quickly,\ninstead of immediately\ncatching up on all the\nsleep they had lost with\none extremely long sleep.\nFuture experiments will\ncontinue to investigate\nthe effects of sleep deprivation on flies\u2019 mental\nperformance.\nThe return of British rockets\nSCIENCE\nWill Harradence\nImperial College Space\nSociety\nI\nn a dark and spacious\nroom, with upbeat\nmusic accompanying\na blue-lit bar, a crowd\nwas gathering to await\nthe latest product reveal\nfrom a hot British start-up. As the CEO took the\nstage, they were ushered\nto their seats, and a mass\nof cameras turned to face\nhim. After an enthusiastic\nspeech, he turned with\na flourish as the curtain\nbehind him dropped to\nreveal the sleek black\nshape of\u2026 a rocket.\nBritish start-up Orbex\nhas revealed new flight\nhardware at the opening\nof their production facility\nin Forres, Scotland. The\nupper stage rocket which\nwas revealed is part of the\ncompany\u2019s Prime launch\nvehicle, which is set to\nbecome the first British-built rocket to launch\nto space in 50 years. The\nevent featured speeches\nfrom the president of\nthe Royal Aeronautical\nSociety, Scottish partners,\nand the head of the UK\nSpace Agency, who noted\na predicted 30,000 new\njobs in the industry over\nthe next 10 years. Imperial\nCollege Space Society\n(previously ICSEDS) was\nalso represented at the\nevent, receiving a mention\nfrom CEO Chris Larmour.\nPresenters stressed the\nimportance and strength\nof the UK space industry,\nthe new opportunities\nafforded by recent technological breakthroughs,\nand the rise of commercial\nlaunch companies world-wide.\nThe small-satellite\nmovement, which favours\nmultiple cheap satellites\nas a replacement for larger\nconventional ones, has\nfinally made it to the UK.\nWith uncertainty about\nthe future relationship\nwith European launch\nproviders, the UK government is keen to support\nhomegrown launch ca-pability. Orbex is one of\nseveral start-ups looking\nto capitalise on this new\nopportunity, but is the first\nto demonstrate full-scale\nhardware.\nPrime features the\nmost powerful 3D printed\nengine ever built, as\nwell as an innovative\npropellant tank system\nthat Orbex claims reduces\nthe weight of the rocket\nby approximately 30%.\nThe rocket also sports\nthe largest payload bay\nsize of any in its class,\nwhich Orbex says will\nbe attractive to satellite\noperators. The rocket\nruns on bio-propane and\nliquid oxygen, reducing\nthe carbon footprint of a\nlaunch, and will feature a\nrapid de-orbiting system\nto reduce its contribution\nto space junk. When\ncompleted, it is expected\nto launch from the new\nScottish spaceport in\nSutherland, and will\ncompete with similar\nsmall launchers such as\nRocket Labs\u2019 Electron.\nLaunch services are\nexpected to commence in\n2021.\nImperial College Space\nSociety is supported by\nOrbex, receiving funds\nfor our aerospace design\nprojects including high\npowered rocketry and\nrocket engine design.\nThe society also runs\nguest lectures and Q&A\nsessions with researchers\nand companies at the\nleading edge of this new\nera in space.\nImperial College Space Society attends the unveiling of Orbex\u2019s new 3D-printed upper stage rocket\nA new rocket engine, fully 3D-printed, adorns the business end of the new upper stage // Will Harradence\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 22ND\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\n\u201cthe UK\ngovernment\nis keen to\nsupport\nhomegrown\nlaunch\ncapability\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s almost like 12\nAngry Men when we walk\nin: twelve desks arranged\nin a rectangle, and at each\nseat an iPad, notebook and\nglass of water. Evidence\nfor the case \u2013 statements,\nforensic reports, video\ntestimonies from both\nsides, and expert opinions\n\u2013 is revealed to us piece\nby piece on the iPads as\nwe go along. Guilty or in-nocent? We get to decide.\nThe evidence is\ndesigned to be equiv-ocal. There is a clear\npower imbalance here:\nHuxtable, a renowned\nneurosurgeon, is clearly\nsocioeconomically better\noff than Hodges, a struggling single mother of\ntwo. Though we might\nwish for more conclusive\nevidence, it just doesn\u2019t\nexist \u2013 much as in real\nlife, where hard evidence\nin rape and sexual assault\ncases is often lacking.\nThis makes it incredibly\ndifficult to decide. It\u2019s\na his-word-against-hers\nsituation, but who is being\ntruthful and who is lying?\nThe tech syncing,\nthanks to computational\nartist Joe McAlister, is\ngreat, with a slick interface and voting results\ndisplayed to everyone\ninstantaneously. Our\niPads are synced and\ndifferent witness statements are read out by\ndifferent jurors \u2013 we all\nget a chance to speak,\nemboldening everyone\nfor the discussions later\non. Although I must say\nI was glad it wasn\u2019t my\niPad that lit up when it\nwas time to read out the\ntranscript of Huxtable\u2019s\nBDSM sexting\u2026!\nMidway through, we\nare even offered the option\nto bar one juror from the\nfinal vote. My group,\nwhich was fairly civil,\nchose not to, but the threat\nof elimination served to\ndeter any single individual from being overly\ndisruptive. The game\ncreators Dan Barnard\nand Rachel Briscoe have\nclearly put a lot of thought\ninto encouraging productive discussion amongst\nparticipants, and it works.\nDespite having never met\neach other before, we\u2019re\nsoon getting into excited\narguments about whether\nor not Huxtable should be\nconvicted.\nThere are 3 opportunities for us to vote on\nwhich way we are leaning,\nand one last discussion of\nall the evidence before the\nfinal decision of the jury\nis handed down. Once\nthe verdict is out, Barnard\nand Briscoe finally appear\nto facilitate the post-game\ndebrief. After all the\ntension of the last hour or\nso, it\u2019s time to clear the\nair and for everyone to\nhash out any unfinished\narguments. It\u2019s another\nexcellent discussion \u2013 I\nget into a small debate\nwith my neighbour about\nhow insufficient evidence\nto convict isn\u2019t the same as\nnot believing the victim.\nBarnard and Briscoe also\ntake the time to point out\nhow social dynamics,\nsuch as groupthink and\ngroup polarisation, can\n(and did) affect group\ndecision-making as well.\nIt\u2019s quite illuminating\nto think about our own\ndecision-making process\nin retrospect and see how\nthese forces actually had\nan influence in real life.\nBefore leaving, we\u2019re\ngiven a \u2018newspaper\u2019\nwith commentary from\nthe game creators, using\nstatistics from their first\n15 sessions, to take home\nand peruse at leisure. It\u2019s a\nfascinating read, showing\nthe radically different\nconclusions that different\ngroups came to. Despite\nthe intentionally equivocal evidence, individuals\nwere able to form very\nstrongly held opinions\non the guilt or innocence\nof Huxtable. I noticed\nthis myself in our group\nsession; several people\nwere deeply convinced\nthat Huxtable was guilty.\nWhen challenged as to\nwhy, they simply said\nthey felt it \u201cin their\nhearts\u201d. Was this borne\nof a desire to protect the\nunderdog? A kind of\nreverse-victim blaming?\nAn effect of the #MeToo\nera that we now live in? I\nfound it strange and disturbing how fallible the\njury system was, and how\nmuch sway emotion held\nover people\u2019s supposedly\nrational decisions.\nInnovative and\nexciting, The Justice Syndicate is not only a fascinating demonstration of\ngroup dynamics, but also\na timely examination of\nattitudes towards sexual\nassault in the present\nsocial climate.\nCrime and Punishment: Czech Edition\nK\natya Kabanova\ncould be\none of those\nplots we have\nheard a million times: a\nwoman avoids immoral-ity, succumbs anyway\nand punishes herself for\nher actions. Unhappy\nmarriage, controlling\nmother-in-law, lover with\nfamily issues, friend who\nnudges her into temp-tation. What is unusual\nabout this particular story\nis the intense focus on\nKatya\u2019s psychological\ndrama which, in stark\ncontrast with the other\ncharacters\u2019 lighthearted-ness, only increases the\nfeeling of her tragedy. She\nis a complex character, a\ngentle soul in a difficult\nsituation and filled with\ncontrasting, violent\nemotions. Singer Amanda\nMajeski steps into her\nshoes with breath-taking\nintensity, making the\naudience (literally) shake\nwith her during her mental\nbreakdown. Director\nRichard Jones helps her\ncreate this effect by cleverly employing his cast of\nchoir members and actors,\nwho fill the stage for ordinary life scenes, empty\nit to emphasize Katya\u2019s\nsolitude and finally fill it\nwith judging, disapproving eyes. Group scenes\ndo play a very important\nrole in the performance,\ndynamically changing the\nsets, introducing comical\nelements and effectively\nintensifying the drama by\nadding an extra dimension\nto the stage.\nAlthough Majeski\u2019s\nextraordinary performance in the title role was\nclearly the highlight of\nthe opera, others are also\nworth a mention. Emily\nEdmons as Varvara and\nSusan Bickley as Katya\u2019s\ntyrannical mother in law\nwere both brilliant in their\nroles, one gaily praising\nlove and the other ped-agogically instructing\na husband how to deal\nwith his wife. A low mark\ngoes to Pavel Cernoch,\nwhose beautiful singing\nwas poorly matched by\nhis acting, resulting in a\nbarely convincing male\nlead. Finally, Dominic\nSedgwick proved he is\nworth keeping an eye\nout for. A participant in\nROH\u2019s Young Artists\nProgramme, his short but\npassionately energetic\ninterventions made me\neager to listen to more of\nhim in the future.\nLike any good disciple\nof the Romantic tradition,\nJanaceck places a large\nweight on symbols.\nNatural elements, such as\na bird, the river Volga that\ncrosses the town where\nthe action takes place,\nand the thunderstorm that\naccompanies the fateful\nupshot of the plot, all have\nmetaphorical significance.\nThe music which represents these elements is\nalso symbolic, providing\nour ears with motifs that\nour subconscious then\nstarts associating with\nspecific events. Often you\ndon\u2019t really need to look\nat the stage to know what\nis going on, even without\nknowing Czech! Particular to Janaceck\u2019s style is\nhis treatment of dialogue.\nHis melodies result from\na thorough study of\nspeaking patterns, so that\nrhythms and tones feel\nnatural and conversation-al, informed by the mood\nand emotional state of the\ncharacters. The orchestration is very effective,\nactively shaping the\naction at every moment.\nOne of my favourite sets\nwas the end of the opera,\nwhere a delicate, yet\ndisturbing off-stage choir\nleads to a tragic orchestral\nconclusion.\nAfter all, this is no\nregular plot. Janacek\u2019s\ndramatic and musical\nmastery together with\nclever staging and great\nperformances make\nKatya Kabanova a ten-sion-packed story of love,\ncrime and punishment.\nARTS\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Calum Drysdale explores both\nthe results of the Finland experiment and what this might mean for UBI in the future.\nCOMMENT\nCalum Drysdale\nComment Writer\nB\nefore I begin I\nshould clarify\nsome terms.\nThe Finland\nexperiment cannot truly\nbe called an experiment in\nUniversal Base Income.\nUBI is the idea that the\ngovernment should give\neach of its citizens a\n\u2018basic\u2019 form of income. It\nhas been picked up by both\nthe left and the right with\nboth the Green party and\nThe Adam Smith Institute\n(an influential centre right\nthink tank) advocating on\nits behalf. While ideology\nvaries, UBI has attracted\na certain utopian miasma,\nbeing heralded as the solution to everything from\nhomelessness to automation caused job loss to an\noverly complicated welfare system. The two-year\nexperiment in Finland that\nhas just concluded was\nnot a form of UBI. Rather\nthan giving money to a\ntruly random selection of\npeople across the demo-graphic, socio-economic\nand cultural range of the\ncountry, unemployed\ncitizens between 25 and\n58 were provided with\n\u20ac560 (\u00a3475) per month on\ntop of any other forms of\nwelfare. However, while\nlimited, it provides a very\ngood case study for the\npolicy.\nUnfortunately for the\nutopianists, the results\nwere not unequivocally\npositive. While the sample\ngroup has reported higher\nlevels of both physical\nand mental wellbeing,\nunemployment figures did\nnot vary from the control\ngroup.\nWhilethelimitednature\nof the study limits what\nconclusions we can draw,\nit does cause us to think\nabout what we want from\na social welfare program.\nThe Finland experiment\nwas not renewed due to a\nperceived lack of success.\nThe desired reduction in\nunemployment, claimed\nto be one of the major\nbenefits of UBI, failed\nto materialise. However,\nhow can we measure the\nsuccess of a program\nthat caused its recipients\nto have \u201cless stress\nsymptoms as well as less\ndifficulties to concentrate\nand less health problems\nthan the control group\u201d.\nAdvocates argue that this\nincrease in quality of life\nis priceless.\nOther studies conducted elsewhere have had\nmore positive results.\nGiveDirectly, a charity\nthat provides direct cash\npayments to extremely\npoor people in countries\nsuch as Kenya and\nUganda, claims that\ncash transfers have had\na positive impact in both\nthe long and short term,\nleading to big reductions\nin HIV/AIDS infection\nrates and low birth weight\nwhile not causing an\nincrease in the purchase\nof temptation goods such\nas alcohol or tobacco.\nA key difference\nbetween these programs\nis their scale. GiveDirectly gave Kenyans $25\na month on top of any\nother income, which, in a\ncountry where the poverty\nline is $57 a month, represents a fairly major sum.\nIn contrast, the Finnish\nstudy gave \u20ac560 per\nmonth. In a country where\nthe average wage is \u20ac3470\nper month. Obviously,\nthese numbers are not\ndirectly comparable but I\nhope they demonstrate my\npoint that the money paid\nto the Kenyans, many of\nwhom had income sources\nother than welfare, is of\na different scale to the\nmoney paid to the unemployed Finnish.\nI think what can be\ntaken from this is that,\nwhile giving money to\nanyone is going to make\nthem happier, it is not\ngoing to act as a panacea.\nPeople are usually unemployed due to underlying\nissues such as a lack of\neducation or chronic\nhealth problems. These\na way of sweetening the\nmedicine of welfare in the\neyes of the middle classes\nby making it seem fair\nand balanced as everyone\nreceives the same amount.\nThe money would be a\nboost to those who know\nhow to handle money and\nnot those, like the unemployed or homeless, that\nhave a proven bad track\nrecord.\nHowever, just like\nthe poll tax that charges\neveryone the same flat\namount, UBI is extremely\nregressive. As an extension of this, the argument\nmade by right-wing advocates of UBI, that it would\nreduce the bureaucracy\nof welfare, is a narrow\nminded one. By limiting\nwelfare exclusively to\nUBI the state would\nbe failing in its duty to\nprovide for its poorest\nmembers.\nSecondly, if UBI is\nintended as a replacement\nof the safety net and as an\nanswer to the problems\nbrought on by automation,\nit will raise important\nquestions about the responsibilities of the state\nto its people. Should the\ngovernment keep funding\nsocial services, the NHS\nand jobseekers if every\ncitizen has, in theory, the\nmeans to live?\nUBI is, to me, a blunt\ninstrument to a complicated problem. The British\nUniversal Credit system,\nthat aims to simplify the\nbenefit system, is far more\nefficient, even if it has\nbeen hamstrung by Tory\nideologues.\nFree money for everyone?/ / DiEM 25\npeople often need more\nthan just cash. They need\nactive help from the state\nrather than hands off and\nimpersonal cash. Here we\narrive at my own personal\nbugbear about UBI.\nI believe that any\nprogram that funnels\nmoney towards the poor\nand unemployed would\nhave a similarly positive\neffect. For me, UBI has\ntwo major flaws. Firstly,\nrather like free university\ntuition, UBI is a poisoned\nchalice that is regressive\nrather than progressive.\nWhilst you can argue\nthat giving money to the\nmiddle classes is going to\nimprove their lot, it is extremely inefficient. Why\ngive money to people\nthat do not need it when\nit could be better spent?\nIn this capacity, UBI is\n\n"

This has\ndrawn inevitable comparisons with the Social\nDemocrat Party, a group\nof four former ministers\nwho resigned in 1981, in\nresponse to the Labour\nparty\u2019s shift to the left. The\nSDP has long been a scare\nstory in British politics for\nthose considering setting\nup their own party. While\nthey managed to gain\n25% of the vote in 1983\nthey gained only 23 MPs\nand the party ended up\nmerging with the Liberal\nParty to form the Liberal\nDemocrats.\nThe #LabourSplit has\ndrawn comment from\nthe more twitter-minded\nof Tory supporters who\nhave indulged in some\nheavy schadenfreude.\nThey should not be so\nquick and should look to\nthe keeping of their own\nhouse before they stir\nelsewhere. While the\nseven MPs, now styled\nas \u201cThe Independent\nGroup\u201d are, with the\nexception of Chuka\nUmunna and Luciana\nBerger, not well known\nto the general public,\nmost of them have\nheld shadow cabinet\npositions. In the games\nof Westminster their\nactions could be the start\nof something far greater\nthan a new SDP.\nThe society we live\nin now is far less class\nstratified than it was in\nthe early 80\u2019s. While\nwealth disparity has\ngrown, studies have\nshown that the manual\nor lower-paid social\nbracket has shrunk\nenormously with 81%\nof Britons employed in\nservice work in 2011.\nThis makes the old\nmodels for political\nparties and their raisons\nd\u2019\u00eatre outdated. Labour\nwas meant to represent\nthe workers while\nthe Tories fought for\nthe middle and upper\nclasses. These divisions\nare no longer relevant as\nBrexit has shown time\nand time again.\nThis is why the Independent Group may just\nbe more than just a flash\nin the pan. Only one\nConservative MP ended\nup joining the SDP. Considering the time period,\nwhile Thatcher was\nwaning in relevance and\npopularity she still went\non to run the country for\nanother nine years. The\nTory party of today, a\nspectrum of Brexiteers\nand Remainers of every\nshade, is a far cry from\nthat age of relative unity.\nThe constant Brexit\nvotes have made a\nmockery of whipping\n(ensuring that MPs\nfollow a party line) as\nMPs vote time and again\nagainst their parties, acquiring a taste for rebel-lion. This has allowed\ncentrist MPs, walking\nthrough the lobbies of\nthe House of Commons,\nto spot those other\nmembers from across\nthe aisle whose liberal,\nurban politics line up\nsignificantly better with\ntheir own than those of\nother party members\nand critically, their party\nleadership.\nTheresa May is not\nMargaret Thatcher,\nshe does not command\nthe respect or loyalty\nof her MPs. Now that\nthe first step has been\ntaken by others I would\nnot be surprised if Tory\nRemainers fling off\nthe millstone necklace\nof the Tory brand and\nlook for something that\noffers them a way out of\nthe current mess.\n\u201cMay is not\nThatchershe does not\ncommand\nthe respect of\nloyalty of her\nMPs\u201d\nArticle written\n19/02/19\nAs of 20/02/19, three\nTory MPs and one additional Labour MP have\ndefected.\n\n"

As\nhad been family tradition\nfor over ten years, this\nChristmas I experienced\nthe Birmingham panto-mime. Now, experienced\nreally is the word - as in\nthat time it has devolved\ninto simultaneously a perfect distillation but also\nparody of the genre, and at\nthis point exists entirely to\nentertain the adults. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong, the funny\nman doing the big fart and\nthe colourful dresses keep\nchildren entertained, but\nthe endless sex jokes and\ndated references reveal\nits true colours. But it is\ndefinitely still pantomime.\nIt has laughs for days,\nthe most flamboyant costumes you will ever see,\nand by god it\u2019s camper\nthan a weekend in the\nPeak District with Freddie\nMercury. Frankly I feel it\nneeds documenting.\nThis year\u2019s show resembled Peter Pan. I say\nresembled as, while many\ncharacters were present,\nthere was also a sizeable\namount of random devia-tion. The \u201cbuttons\u201d- alike\n(played by a man named\nMatt slack who literally\ncarries the entire show)\nwas Mr. Smee, rewritten\nas the nanny of the kids\nand a spy for them once\nin Neverland. There is\nalso a fairy godmother\ncharacter, who you may\nbe surprised to find is\nnot actually a fairy but a\nmagical mermaid with\nshort term memory loss\nwho flies around in a giant\nclam shell. Buckle up, we\nare just getting started.\nWhile the kids fly to\nNeverland with fairy dust,\nMr. Smee travels by means\nof flying vesper which is\nhydraulically lifted above\nthe audience in a very\nconvincing effect. Upon\narrival the plot proceeds\nto play in both high speed\nand slow motion. The\nshow tries to hit all the\nimportant moments of\nthe source material, but\ngiven half the scenes are\njust vehicles to tell jokes,\n30% are immaculately\nchoreographed dance\nnumbers and 10% are\nsudden intense acrobatics\nsessions that teach you\nthe meaning of tension,\nthere isn\u2019t much time left\nfor plot. Vital moments\njust suddenly happen,\nthe first time the word\n\u201cmum\u201d is used is when\nPeter asks Wendy to be\nhis. Tink drinking the\npoison completely alone\nis such an immense plot\nhole that Smee calls her\na stupid cow. There is a\nfive-minute scene in the\nsecond-half where Hook\nand Smee flirt, ending\nwith a metaphorical\norgasm when Smee\u2019s\nguitar explodes. A joke is\nmade about Smee having\nan inflatable girlfriends\nbefore he returns to save\nthe day using an extended\nmatrix parody wherein\nphysical theatre is used to\nshow slow motion. Still\nwith me?\nOf course, there are\nconstant fourth wall\nbreaks throughout. Along\nwith the classic \u201coh no\nyou didn\u2019t\u201d and such there\nare meta jokes about who\nthe actors are, about the\nreality of putting on a\nshow etc. Donny Osmand\nplays Hook and Smee\nspends the entire show\nasking where Jimmie is;\nWendy at the end makes\na long and painful Brexit\njoke to the audience and,\nduring the final loving\nmoment between Pan\nand Wendy, Smee pipes\nup and reminds everyone\nthat the actor playing Pan\nis 35. This immediately\ncaused the entire cast to\ncorpse in a moment that\nwill stick with me forever.\nAnd with that, the\nshow is basically over\n- there is only one more\ntradition to fulfil. At the\nend, Smee brings four\nkids from the audience up\non stage to talk to them\nabout the show, make\nsome wholesome jokes to\nthe audience, give them\npresents and make them\nfeel special. It\u2019s a sweet\nway to end the show. I,\nhaving been so many\ntimes, know how easily\nthis can go awry. This year\nfor instance one of the kids\nwouldn\u2019t stop dancing, at\nany point. Another was\nso bewildered he could\nbarely speak, but it all\nplayed out nice in the end.\nI would be remiss not to\nmention last year though,\nwherein one of the\nchildren was a seamless\nplant. We know this,\nbecause after seemingly\nacting like a show-off to\nthe audience, the straight-faced Buttons character\nsaid, \u201cno one likes a\nknow-it-all\u201d, picked up\nthe kid and dropped him\ninto the band\u2019s pit. The\nentire audience lost it. The\npower of subversion of\nexpectations.\nNo doubt, what I witnessed that Christmas Eve\nwas completely senseless,\nbarely even trying to tell a\nstory. But here is the thing,\nwhile it may be nonsense,\ndeep down, you can\u2019t tell\nme you don\u2019t want to experience it. Over the years\nthe show has reached the\npoint of maximum mess.\nThe whole thing feels like\nwhat you and your mates\nmight pull together if you\nwere told you had to put\non a show and had an\nhour to prepare, but with\nthe budget of a Broadway\nproduction. Frankly, there\nis nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced quite like it and\nthat is why, at 21, I have\nevery intention of going\nagain next year - and you\nshould too.\nFinally, I wish to\nextend my best wishes\nto Donny Osmand who\nsuffered a stroke mid\nshow only three days\nafter I was there.

However,\nlike many other 70 year\nolds, the NHS is facing\nmultiple chronic issues\nthat cannot be fixed with a\nsimple operation. Patients\nare waiting longer and\nlonger to see a doctor,\nboth in GP practices and\nA&Es. This is due to a\nmultitude of reasons,\nranging from inadequate\nrecruitment and chronic\nunderfunding, to an aging\npopulation with more\ncomplex healthcare needs.\nIt is largely agreed that the\ncurrent NHS model is not\nsustainable.\nIntrinsic efforts to\nimprove the health of the\nNHS, termed \u2018efficiency\nsavings\u2019, have helped a\nbit, but have not reached\nthe ambitious targets\nset by the government.\nInstead, the government\nhas resorted to bullying\njunior doctors and\nnurses, squeezing out\nevery ounce of their\ncollective good will.\nOverworked, underpaid,\nand morale at its nadir;\nthe system is creaking\nat the seams. Surely any\nacute changes to the\ndelicate balance currently keeping the NHS\ntogether would lead to\nits demise. Enter stage\nright: Brexit.\nDuring the referendum campaign in 2016,\nBrexit was touted as the\nsaviour for the NHS.\nBrexiteers recommended taking the money\nwe would normally\ngive the EU and reinvesting it to improve\nour health services.\nFurthermore, they\nproposed that regaining\ncontrol of the borders\nwould prevent \u2018health\ntourists\u2019 and \u2018economic\nmigrants\u2019 from entering\nour country, and would\ntherefore reduce the\nstrain on our public\nservices. Both of these\nclaims were the basis\nof the \u2018Save our NHS\u2019\ncampaign run by Vote\nLeave.\nAs attractive as the\nVote Leave claims are,\nthey wilfully ignore the\nbenefits of staying in the\nEU. This is becoming\nincreasingly clear as\nauthorities are preparing\nfor a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit,\nsince negotiations\nbetween the EU and UK\ngovernment continue to\nbreak down. A \u2018no-deal\u2019\nBrexit could lead to a\n10% decrease in UK\nGDP in 15 years. Even\nif a deal is made, it is\nstill not forecasted to\nbenefit GDP in the long\nrun. Since the health\nof the NHS mirrors the\nstrength of the economy,\nthe NHS will struggle for\nthe foreseeable future\ndue to Brexit. However,\nBrexiteers argue that\nthis is not accurate as\neconomic forecasts\nare frequently wrong,\nciting the example that\nthe economy is currently growing despite\nforecasts predicting a\npost-referendum reces-sion. Nonetheless, the\none thing that can be\nagreed is that \u2018no-deal\u2019\nwould be the worst\noutcome economically.\nForecasted economic\ngrowth also depends on\nchanges in EU migration\npolicy. Currently around\n130,000 doctors, nurses\nand care-workers are recruited from the EU. In\n2018, there was a 17.6%\ndecrease in EU workers\njoining the NHS and\n15.3% increase of EU\nworkers leaving the\nNHS. The National\nInstitute of Economic\nand Social Research\npredicts there will be\n10,000 extra nursing\nvacancies due to a lack\nof EU workers by 2021.\nAdditionally, by 2025\nthey predict that there\nwill be a gap of up to\n70,000 workers in social\ncare. This is clearly not\nideal considering the\nimportance of nurses\nand social workers in\nmanaging our ageing\nand growing population.\nHowever this has been\ndeemed \u201cfear-mongertical Industry. Consequently, the Department\nof Health has revealed\nthat they have started to\nstockpile 6 weeks\u2019 worth\nof prescription medications as a contingency\nplan. For medical items\nwith shorter shelf-lives\n(such as radioactive\nisotopes used in nuclear\nmedicine), plans have\nbeen made for these\nto be transported in\nby air at short notice.\nAll of these measures\nare fairly expensive to\nthe taxpayer and could\ncost up to \u00a32 billion\naccording to the Remain\ncampaign group, Best\nfor Britain. Stockpiling\ndrugs seems to paint an\nimage of an apocalyp-tic-like scenario and is\nan illustration of how\ndangerous Brexit really\nis. During the campaign,\nsituations like these\nwere labelled as \u2018Project\nFear\u2019 but, 33 months\nlater, it is really happen-ing- it\u2019s the \u2018real deal\u2019.\nIt seems Brexit was\nsold to the public based\non misinformation and\nlies. Therefore one could\nargue that the \u201cinformed\nconsent\u201d declared by the\npublic in the advisory\nreferendum is not valid,\nas the benefits and risks\nwere not appropriately\nexplained. As a consequence of this wilful de-ception, the health of the\nNHS has deteriorated.\nIn medico-legal terms,\nthis would be classified criminal battery\nand can result in a jail\nsentence. In political\nterms, this is classified\nas \u2018campaigning\u2019, so no\none is held accountable\nfor running a \u2018Save our\nNHS\u2019 movement which\nmay eventually \u2018End our\nNHS\u2019.\n\u201cNo one is held accountable for running a\u2018Save our NHS\u2019movement which may eventually\u2018End our NHS\u2019\u201d// Pixabay\ning\u201d by Brexiteers, who\nclaim the predictions\nare based on flawed\nassumptions and claim\nBritain will still be\nopen for business after\nBrexit. Indeed, doctors\nand nurses are now\nexcluded from the cap\non tier 2 visas for skilled\nworkers.

    "content": "ISSUE 1715\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n16\nA trip down memory lane: two mini reviews\nOver the Christmas break, Books writer Pavan Inguva revisited some old book purchases - and realised the\ntimelessness of themes and inclinations.\nB\nefore starting\nat Imperial, I\ntook a short\nholiday to\nIndia to visit friends and\nfamily. For those of you\nwho don\u2019t know, India\nis an amazing place to\nbuy books. You can get\noriginal prints of many\nbooks for a fraction of\nthe price compared to\nany western country.\nObviously I took this\nchance to stock up. I\ndid not however have\nthe time to read many\nof them. Fast forward\nto Christmas break this\nacademic year, when\nthe parents summoned\nme to go home, I took\nthe chance to browse\nthrough my bookshelf.\nThis invoked a remarkable sense of nostalgia.\nIt has been more than\nthree years since I had\na proper look at my\nown little collection. I\nwas both surprised and\nsaddened to see how\nmuch more I read before\nstarting university. That\nsaid, this was a fantastic\nopportunity to review\nhow my own thoughts\nand literary tastes have\nevolved over the past\ncouple of years. I decided to bring back two\nrelatively short books,\nboth titles I purchased\nin 2015 or earlier and\nhave yet to read. Quite\nfrankly, considering\nhow busy final year can\nbe, I thought it would\nbe a miracle if I could\nfinish them during term\ntime, yet here we are!\nThis review therefore is\nto me a mix of sharing\nhow I felt about these\ntwo books and an oddly\ntherapeutic exercise\nin retrospection. Both\ntitles are fairly straightforward reads that\nwould take a leisurely\nafternoon.\nNo One Writes to\nthe Colonel by\nGabriel Garcia\nMarquez\nintroduced to the char-acters, there is almost\nnothing of value they\nown except for a prized\nfighting cock. The cock\nis the last thing they own\nthat belonged to their\nson who was executed\nfor distributing subversive literature. We are\nled down the mildly\ndepressing path where\nthe Colonel gradually\nrealises the futility of his\nhope in both his pension\ncoming and of the cock\nyielding the desired\nreturns. This work\ndeparts from Marquez\u2019s\nstyle of magic realism,\nbut it still is remarkably\neffective in shedding\nlight on the human\npsyche and response to\ncircumstances beyond\nour control. I say this\nbecause, whilst reading\nthis book, images of\na dusty Indian village\nfrom a soap opera pop\ninto mind; people ostensibly behave in a similar\nmanner when faced with\ncomparably adverse\ncircumstances.\nBeneath the\nWheel by\nHerman Hesse\nHerman Hesse // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nPavan Inguva\nBooks Writer\n\u201cThe title of\nthis book\ncomes from\nthe line\nsaid by the\npostmaster to\nthe Colonel as\nhe distributes\nthe mail to the\nvillagers:\u2018No\none writes to\nthe Colonel!\u2019\u201d\naged (read: pressured/\nled) to pursue further\nacademic studies.\nHaving performed\nexceedingly well in the\nstate exam, he entered\na prestigious academy.\nAt each step, for having\nperformed well, he was\nrewarded with more\nwork. At the academy,\nHans befriends a rebellious romantic and poet\nand gradually is exposed\nto worlds outside schol-arship. Simultaneously,\nhis academic performance declines and in\na cascading series of\nsetbacks, he drops out\nof the academy. Eventually, Hans becomes\nan apprentice mechanic\nand is gradually healed\nby nature and romance\nonly to meet his unfortunate end after a\njolly with his fellow\napprentices. Whilst this\nplot may seem rather\ntrite when read today,\ntwo points help mitigate\nthis. Firstly, Beneath the\nMarquez, who won\nthe 1982 Nobel prize\nfor Literature, is more\nwell-known for his\nother works such as\nOne Hundred Years of\nSolitude and Love in the\nTime of Cholera. This\nstory is set in the 1940s,\nwhere a nameless retired\nand impoverished\nColonel is struggling\nto make ends meet. He\ndutifully awaits his\nmilitary pension which\nwas supposed to have\narrived many a moon\nago. The title of this\nbook comes from the\nline said by the postmaster to the Colonel as\nhe distributes the mail to\nthe villagers: \u201cNo one\nwrites to the Colonel!\u201d.\nHis asthmatic wife\nknows all the better\nthat it is not coming\nand, by the time we are\nWheel was written over\na hundred years ago\nand the content remains\nrelevant. Secondly,\nHesse\u2019s sublime writing\nstyle still makes it an\nenjoyable and thought\nprovoking read.\nBefore going to uni-versity, Hermann Hesse\nwas one of my favourite\nauthors. I enjoyed how\nmany of Hesse\u2019s stories\ndescribe the inner\nturbulence of what it\nmeans to seek for the\ngood life and what that\nconstitutes. I hesitate\nto say that his work is\nwell-suited for working\nthrough teenage existential angst because it is so\nmuch more than that, but\nyou get my drift. I would\nhighly recommend\nreading Steppenwolf and\nThe Glass Bead Game as\nthese are, in my opinion,\ntwo of his most profound\nworks. Incidentally, he\ndid win the Nobel prize\nfor Literature in 1946.\nBeneath the Wheel is\none of Hesse\u2019s earlier\nworks and, having read\nmany of his books in\na random order, it was\ninteresting to see themes\npresent in later works\ntaking shape here. Hans,\na boy living in a small\nvillage near the Black\nForest was identified as\na capable student and\ncorrespondingly encour\u201cI hesitate\nto say that\nhis work is\nwell-suited\nfor working\nthrough\nteenage\nexistential\nangst because\nit is so much\nmore than\nthat\u201d\n\n"

The Imperial\nteam knew that this was\nan important match to win\nto carry momentum into\nthe weekend and nerves\nwere running high.\nSo it was a soothing\nsurprise and a huge moral\nboost when the team\nturned up to the venue\nto find that the \u201cTree\nChopper\u201d a.k.a. Patrick\nBrandl was there waiting\nfor us. He had made the\neffort to catch a 6 a.m.\ntrain to come all the way\nfrom London to cheer his\nteam-mates on.\nWhat difference does\nthat extra support make?\nWell Imperial beat Newcastle 4-1 this time around\nwith Seigo \u201cTop knot\u2019ch\u201d\navenging his last year\u2019s\ndefeat by saving 5 match\nballs against him to win\n3-2.\nThe second match was\nrather straightforward for\nGBUCS team from left to right: James McCouat, Marco Alves, Seigo Masuda, Puven Subramaniam, Dave Newman,\nand Patrick Brandl. // IC Squash\nof energy despite only\na couple hours sleep, to\ncommence the final battle,\nand what a battle it was\u2026\nSquash is a brutal sport.\nLike any other racket\nsport, skill and tactics\nare important but the\nphysical demands that\nsquash places on the body\nare widely considered\nto be the toughest of any\nsport. Players will hit\ntheir maximum heart rate\nrepeatedly in even just a\nsingle rally.\nA rally can last in the\nregion of fifty shots, and it\nis common for players to\naverage between 5km and\n10km in lunges alone over\nthe course of a match.\nIn the case of the\nhound\u2019s opponent, he hit\nhis maximum heart rate\ntoo many times, vomiting\nfrom sheer exhaustion on\ncourt in the middle of an\nepic rally. In squash terms,\nthis is a TKO \u2013 match\nforfeited.\nJames was not alone\nin proving his physical\nsuperiority, with veteran\nDave \u201cIceman\u201d Newman\nrolling back the years to\nfloor his opponent (literal-ly \u2013 he passed out after the\nmatch only to resurface\ntwo hours later). Marco\n\u201cPlayers\nwill hit their\nmaximum\nheart rate\nrepeatedly\nin even just a\nsingle rally\u201d\nthe team against Loughborough. Everyone won\ntheir matches, meaning\nthat the team won by 5-0.\nAnd it was looking like\n5th place would once\nagain be within reach with\njust Nottingham Trent,\nonly recently promoted\nto the big leagues, to\nbeat on Sunday morning.\nBut Nottingham Trent\nhad shown already that\nthey were at home in the\ntop division by inflicting\ndefeats on both Loughborough and Newcastle\non the Saturday. Imperial\nwould therefore need to\nsteel themselves for a\nclose fight for that coveted\n5th spot at the top of their\ngroup.\nWith the \u201cTree\nChopper\u201d on his way back\nto his cabin in the woods,\nthe team made their way\nto the venue the following morning with some\ntrepidation. Would Dave\n\u201cN\u2019iceman\u201d Newman\u2019s\naging body hold up to\nanother tough match?\nWould Puven \u201cPsych\u201d\nSivasangari finish digesting the all-you-can-eat\ncarb-loading sushi session\nHallowed ground where games took place. // IC Squash\nfrom the previous night?\nThe answer to these questions and the outcome of\nthe match were all coming\ndown to the wire.

    "content": "ISSUE 1715\nFELIX\n32\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nTom Alston\nInvestment Editor\nICIS Editor in Chief\nA\nt the beginning of the\nmonth, Beth\nHammack, a\nsenior Goldman Sachs\nbanker and chair of the\ngovernment advisory\ngroup know as the\nTreasury Bond Advisory\nCommittee sent a letter to\nSteven Mnuchin, Treasury\nSecretary, warning that\naccording to TBAC cal-culations, America will\nneed to sell $12 trillion of\nbonds before the end of\nthe decade. The question\nloomed that who in the\nglobal financial industry\nwill buy this vast amount\nof treasuries? This is\nespecially worrying after\nChina\u2019s holdings of US\ntreasuries (previously\nprobably the most reliable source for demand\nfor American debt as it\namassed vast foreign exchange reserves amid its\nexport boom) shrank from\n$1.25tn to $1.12tn over\nthree years. Chinese diplomats deny that this is part\nof a political game amid\ntrade tensions between the\ntwo superpowers. Fang\nXinghai, vice-chairman\nof the China Regulatory\nCommission stressed that\nBeijing does not intend\nto \u201csignificantly reduce\nits investment into the\nUS government bond\nmarket\u201d. Instead many\ninvestors see the declining Chinese demand for\nUS debt as a result of\nits slowing imports and\nchanging demographics.\nFurthermore, China is\nnot alone. Ms. Hammack\nwarned in her letter about\n\u201ca stagnation in international reserves\u201d and that\nin the future there must\nbe \u201can increased need\nfor this [US] debt to be\nfinanced domestically\u201d.\nFortunately, American\ninterest rate hikes, causing\ncash to funnel into bonds,\nwhose fixed interest\npayments become more\nvaluable if the base rates\nfall. However, this was expected as Investors feared\nthat increasing interest\nrates would push the US\neconomy into recession,\nbringing to an end a credit\ncycle which had seen\ncompanies stockpile low\nrate debt. Despite this,\nHans Mikkelsen, a strategist at Bank of America\nMerrill Lynch, warned\nthat a further increase in\nsupply could test investor\ndemand as seen with sovereign bonds.\nMeanwhile, across\nthe pond Germany\u2019s\ninsistence on running a\nbalanced budget and a\ncurrent account surplus\nhas led to no expansion\nin debt issuance.\nConsequently, there is an\nundersupply of Bunds,\ncreating a shortage of safe\nassets in the eurozone.\nThis leads to exacerbation\nof the price effect of\nEuropean Bank bond-buying, increasing the\nspread between German\nyields and those of riskier\nassets for example Italian\nsovereign bonds. The\nyield of the 10-year Bund\nhas slipped this year to\n0.1%, increasing the\nspread against equivalent\nItalian bonds to 2.9%.\nEU budget rules do aim\nto ward off excessive\nsurpluses, as the euro was\ncreated \u201cas a means of\nstrengthening the political\nbonds between [European\nNations]\u201d as stated by the\nEuropean Commission.\nBy deliberately under\nborrowing you leave the\ncontinent\u2019s banks and\npension funds suffocating\ndomestic savers have been\nfilling the gap. American\nhouseholds held nearly\n$2.3tn in Treasuries in\nNovember last year,\nincreasing from $1.9tn\nfrom January. Despite\nthis, with the governments\nincreased spending plans\nthe need for US debt is\nrising. Some hedge-funds\nnow conclude that in five\nyears\u2019 time the Treasury\nwill need to sell bonds\nequivalent to 25% of\nGDP, up from 15% now.\nThat level of debt has only\noccurred twice in the past\n120 years. Once during\nthe second world war and\nagain during the 2008\nfinancial crisis. The clear\nsolution would be for the\nTrump administration to\nchange its fiscal aims and\nreduce its reliance of debt,\nbut with no mention of the\nproblem during his State\nof the Union speech, that\nis very unlikely. Further\nsouring the situation is\nthe $9 trillion corporate\ndebt bomb, \u201cbubbling\u201d in\nthe US economy. Many\nInvestors worry about this\nas the current cash-to-debt\nratio for corporate borrowers fell to 12% (lowest\never), which means there\nis a shortage of cash to\ncover this debt. There is\nno slowing this advance\nas the Fed U-turns on\nUS 10 Year Treasury Yield// CNCBC\n10 Year Bund Yield // CNBC\nSovereign debt: a tale of two dilemma\u2019s\nunder a shortage of\nsafe assets. Is Germany\ntherefore fulfilling that\npledge? Interestingly the\nshortage of bunds has\nmany investors worried\nabout bubbles in sectors\nsuch as real estate.\nInvestors need to put their\nmoney in something and\nwhen there aren\u2019t enough\nBunds going around they\nare forced into substitute\nassets which become\noverloaded and hence\nsuffer price bubbles.\n\n"

Due to the league\ntimetabling, our matches\nagainst them are the final\ntwo consecutive matches\nof the season. This meant\nthat the loser of this\nseries will get relegated\nto Division 2. Both teams\nwere eager to get on with\nit, and the energy was the\nhighest it has been all\nseason.\nThe first game was at\nFortress Harlington. The\nChargers took the opening\nkick-off. The offence did\nnot start off well on the\nfirst drive as we seemed\ndestined for a three-and-out. However, one of the\nCanterbury players failed\nto cleanly field the ensuing\npunt, and we were able to\ncapitalize on this mistake\nand recover the ball,\nwhich kept the opening\ndrive alive. We marched\non with powerful running\nby Jonas \u201cDreadnought\u201d\nEschenfelder all the way\nto their 10-yard line. Unfortunately, they managed\nto intercept a wobbly pass\nat their own two-yard line,\nleaving the Chargers with\ndifficult field-position.\nOur vaunted defence\ncame out of the gate hot\nalmost getting a safety and\nforcing Canterbury to punt\nfrom inside their own yard\nline. The lack of space\nand the heavy pressure\nresulted in a blocked punt\nwe recovered at their\n15-yard line. From there a\ncouple of passes and a QB\nsneak play resulted in us\nopening the score 8-0. We\nnever slowed down from\nthat point until the half,\nonly allowing a single first\ndown from the Chargers\nand scoring three more\ntouchdowns thanks, to\ngreat passing by Ben \u201cBig\nRed\u201d O\u2019Brien that made\nup for his earlier intercep-tion. This led to the score\nbeing 26-0 at the half.\nCanterbury were\nsomewhat able to neutralize the offence, but they\ncould not find an answer\nto get past our defensive\nfront eight, especially\nour nose tackle Michael\n\u201cDrama Sec\u201d Anyanechi.\nWe kept stifling their\nQB by penetrating their\noffensive line that looked\nmore like a sieve than a\nwall by the second half,\nwhich all culminated by\nDom \u201cRoadRage Gang\u201d\nDeSilva recovering a\nfumble in the end zone\nfor a touchdown. Also,\nspecial shout out to\nNick \u201cDaddy\u201d Hoare for\nhandling his first game\nat center with plenty of\npoise.\nThe final score was\n40-0 in our favour, but\nthis is only half the battle.\nPart 2 coming next week.\n#BecomeImmortal\nTaekwondo\u2019s Winter Championships spirit unbeatable\nT\nwenty members\nof Imperial\nC o l l e g e\nT a e k w o n d o\n(ICUTKD) travelled to\nNottingham for the Winter\nChampionships held\nby the British Student\nTaekwondo Federation\n(BSTF).

    "content": "ISSUE 1715\nFELIX\n6\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics writer Ansh Bhatnagar thinks that the small group of MPs that left the Labour party\nhave committed themselves to a failed ideology that was popular prior to the 2008 financial\ncrash. They\u2019re certainly not deserving of his support.\nPOLITICS\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nPolitics Writer\nO\nn Monday\nmorning, a\ngroup of 7\nLabour MPs\ntook the unprecedented\nstep of leaving the Labour\nParty and forming a new\ncentrist \u201cparty\u201d, taking\nthe incredibly bland name\nof \u2018The Independent\nGroup\u2019. Except it was\nnot unprecedented at\nall \u2013 most of these MPs,\nsuch as their ringleader\nChuka Umunna, have\nbeen vocally and visibly\nopposed to the Labour\nParty ever since 2015,\nwhen Jeremy Corbyn\nachieved a landslide\nvictory in the leadership\nelection. They were also\npart of the 2016 coup\nwhen the Parliamentary\nLabour Party (PLP) forced\nCorbyn into another\nleadership election, which\nhe won with an increased\nvote share. The leaks\nTheir official Statement\nof Independence cites\nthat they believe \u201cnone of\ntoday\u2019spoliticalpartiesare\nfit to provide the leadership and direction needed\nby our country\u201d. They say\ntheir aim is to pursue \u201cevidence-based\u201d policies not\nbased on ideology. Such\na display of ignorance\nwould be quite shocking\nfor seasoned politicians\nif it didn\u2019t fit in with the\nusual centrist talking\npoints. All politicians\nare led by ideology, and\naccording to the statement\ntheirs is an ideology of\nBlair and Clinton\u2019s Third\nWay from the 90s, of a\n\u201csocial market economy\u201d\nand a pro-war, pro-in-tervention military state.\nThey believe that a bit of\nregulation and welfare\non an otherwise neoliberal capitalist system is\nenough to combat the\nissues of rising inequality,\neconomic exploitation,\nhomelessness and climate\nchange. Angela Smith,\none of the seven, has been\na supporter of Thatcher\u2019s\nwater privatisation,\nhaving vested interests in\nthe industry. They even\ndraw from Conservative\ntalking points, claiming\nthat opportunity is the\nway for individuals to\nleave poverty, rather than\ncommitting to eliminating poverty altogether.\nThe verdict is clear; it\nis fundamentally a capitalist ideology that fails\nto address its inherent\ncontradictions. To claim\nthat they are not led by\nideology is contradictory\nto the rest of their statement and intellectually\ndishonest.\nThis is why I say good\nriddance. As a Labour\nmember I am not interested in sharing a party\nwith politicians cosying\nup to Tory MPs and those\nwho believe that the 2017\nmanifesto is \u201ctoo radical\u201d,\nbecause it really isn\u2019t. It\nis the bare minimum that\nthis country needs and\nBig Chukas, yet another dead meme // Wikimedia\n\u201cThese MPs\nwore the red\nrosette and\ncommitted\nthe policies\npromised by a\nfuture Labour\ngovernment\u201d\nthe future Labour govern-ment. They benefitted off\nthe money the party and\ntrade unions poured into\ntheir campaigns, as well\nas the hard-working activists who door-knocked\nand canvassed for them \u2013\nordinary citizens suffering\nunder a Tory government\nbut volunteering their\nown time to get Labour\ncandidates elected. Their\nconstituents voted for a\nLabour MP standing on\nthe 2017 manifesto, and\nby resigning their Labour\nmembership to form a\ncoalition with the Tories,\nthey have betrayed each\nand every one of their\nvoters and past supporters\npolicy by policy is what\nthe public overwhelmingly back. The UK centre\nground is in favour of\nan end to austerity and\nsocial democracy: having\nthe wealthy pay their\nfair share, having strong\npublic services with universal healthcare and free\neducation from cradle to\ngrave, and taking water,\nenergy, gas, the buses,\nthe railways etc back\ninto public ownership so\nprofits can be reinvested\ninto making our experiences better, cheaper, and\ngreener. It is in favour of\nbold solutions to fight the\nclimate crisis facing us\ntoday. The centre ground\nis with Labour\u2019s 2017\nmanifesto and that would\nbe just the start of the\npolitical revolution that\nneeds to take place in post-2008 austerity Britain.\nThese MPs stood on\nthat manifesto of hope,\nand each one of them\nincreased their vote shares\nin the 2017 General\nElection, securing their\njobs as MPs earning more\nthan \u00a377k per annum.\nThey stood wearing the\nred rosette, committed\nto implementing these\npolicies and supporting\n\u201cThe leaks\nabout a new\ncentrist have\nbeen going\nround for\nmonths. This is\nunsurprising\u201d\nabout a new centrist party\nhave been going around\nfor months so this came\nto nobody\u2019s surprise. So\nwhy did they join with\nthree ex-Conservatives\nand leave Labour?\nThe Independent Group? No thanks\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY, 22ND\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX\n7\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nwho got them these jobs.\nThey refuse to stand\ndown as MPs and call\nby-elections to campaign\nhonestly on their new plat-forms. That\u2019s a personal\nsacrifice they are not\nwilling to make for their\nnew politics. Instead they\nhave formed a political\ngrouping, \u2018The Independent Group\u2019: it is asking\nfor donations, asking for\npeople to sign up, it is\nspeaking as one voice \u2013 in\nshort, acting like a political party. However, they\nhave not registered as a\npolitical party, but instead\nas a private company that\ndoes not have to disclose\nits donors. Every action\nthey\u2019ve taken is shady and\ndodgy, and shows they\nlack any conviction in\ntheir own political beliefs.\nThe conversation\nwouldn\u2019t be complete\nwithout mentioning\nanother reason that these\nMPs cite for leaving: the\nproblem of antisemitism\nin the Labour Party.\nLuciana Berger is a\ntropes, and especially how\nleft-wing views regarding the Israel-Palestine\nconflict can sometimes\nbecome too accommodating to antisemitic rhetoric\nin the fringes. Momentum,\nthe successor of Jeremy\nCorbyn\u2019s leadership\ncampaign, has done some\nexcellent work producing\neducational videos that\nreach the very minority\nthat espouses this racist\nrhetoric; but we need the\nParty to take inspiration\nfrom them and listen to\nJewish members in order\nto truly eradicate antisemitism from our movement.\nThe other MPs cite\nantisemitism as a reason\nfor them leaving as\nwell, claiming that this\nnew \u201cparty\u201d will be a\nsocially progressive\nvoice. However, this\nclaim quickly collapsed\na mere 3 hours after the\nlaunch, with the group\nbeing embroiled in a\nracist scandal \u2013 Angela\nSmith went on national\nTV and referred to ethnic\nminorities as people with\na \u201cfunny tinge\u201d. Smith\nissued a weak non-apol-ogy later, apologising for\n\u201cany offence caused\u201d and\nclaiming she misspoke.\nFor 1/7th of the membership of a new \u2018anti-racist\u2019\nparty to promote racist\nrhetoric within three hours\nof launching must be some\nsort of record. None of the\nother six MPs denounced\nbefore the Labour Party\ninvestigations into them\ncould be completed.\nAmong the seven is\nalso Gavin Shuker, who\nthreatened to resign from\nthe Shadow Cabinet if the\nLabour Party supported\ngay marriage \u2013 in the end\nhe abstained on it. It is\nevident that \u2018The Independent Group\u2019 are not a\nsocially progressive group\nby any measure.\nLabour, while not\nperfect, is still the best\nvehicle for any sort of\nprogressive politics. With\na mass membership of\nhalf a million making\nit the largest party in\nEurope, it is backed and\nfunded by ordinary people\nfrom all over the country.\nDue to the massive\nongoing democratisation\nproject, it has become the\nonly party where ordinary\nworking people can take\npart in politics and make\ntheir voice heard \u2013 where\nmembers are valued and\nnot just treated like a\ncampaigning tool.\nUnfortunately, it is\nclear that The Independent\nGroup is just another regressive Third Way tribute\nact from the 90s, trying to\nresurrect a zombie politics\nthat has long been dead.\nThey claim to oppose a\nright-wing Tory Brexit,\nbut by standing against\nthe Labour Party they\nhave made that outcome\nmuch more likely, risking\nthe country facing a\ndisastrous no deal Brexit\nbecause of their opportun-ism. Ultimately, they will\nfail like the SDP before\nthem and merge with the\nLiberal Democrats, but\nuntil then, they are only\nassisting the Tories in\ntheir pursuit of a tax haven\nausterity Britain.\nHe probably doesn\u2019t look this happy atm // Wikimedia\nantisemitism, but about\npolicy as well. Choosing\nto conveniently brush\naside antisemitism when\nit suits them, to the point\nof not even mentioning it\non their official Statement\nof Independence despite\nmentioning it in their\ntelevised speeches, makes\ntheir commitment to an-ti-racism questionable at\nbest and a cynical political\nlie at worst.\nThere are also rumours\nthat the group will\nwelcome ex-Labour MPs\nJohn Woodcock and Ivan\nLewis, both formally\naccused of sexual harassment and resigned\n\u201cWe have to\ntalk about\nanti-semitism\nin the Labour\nparty\u201d\nJewish woman who is\none of these MPs and has\nfaced disgusting abuse\nfrom some members of\nthe party online and in\nher constituency, and her\nleaving with antisemitism\nas one of her reasons\nserves as a real wake\nup call for the Party\u2019s\ndisciplinary processes,\nwhich need to be stricter\nand swifter in combatting\nantisemitism. Even one\nJewish member leaving\nthe party due to antisemitism is too many, and\nLabour needs to urgently\nimprove its processes and\nembark on a programme\nof political education to\nensure those members\nrealise the damage they do\nwhen they use antisemitic\n\u201cThe group\nwas quickly\nembroiled in a\nracist scandal,\non national\ntelevision\u201d\nthe comment, with Chris\nLeslie saying in response\nto the hypocrisy that their\nleaving wasn\u2019t just about\n\n"

He lives\nin a dystopian Britain in\nthe 1980s, spending his\nevenings with his three\n\u201cdroogs\u201d: Georgie, Dim\nand Pete, drinking drug\ninfused \u201cmilk-plus\u201d and\ngoing around partaking in\na bit of the old in out and\nultra violence. The way\nthese scenes are portrayed\nis why this film was pulled\nfrom British screens in the\n70s and didn\u2019t return until\n1999.\nThroughout the film\nthere is a healthy serving\nof violence, slimy poli-ticians, dodgy probation\nofficers and a lot of\ndicks; maybe a few too\nmany to be perfectly\nhonest, though they do\nadd a good helping of\nimmature comedy to the\nfilm. Yet one thing which\nsticks out even more than\nlollipop penises is the use\nof music throughout the\nfilm. The way music is\nused is nothing short of\nmasterful; from making\na threesome amusing, to\nadding even more drama\nto fight scenes. To the pro-tagonist, Alex, music is\nalso incredibly important\nas he has a deep love for\nLudwig van Beethoven,\nsomething Kubrick uses\nthroughout; not only as\na plot device, but also to\ndeliver specific political\nand moral messages.\nEven though this film\nwasmadenearly5decades\nago it remains incredibly\nrelevant. Violence and\ncrime in today\u2019s society\nis just as problematic and\ndisruptive as it was 50\nyears ago, and politicians\nare still being manipulative and \u2018doing their best\u2019\nfor the people. Fashion\nand technology have\nmoved on a bit, and so has\nmedical testing, I would\nhope, but the underlying\nmessages about morality\nand politics are just as\nrelevant today as they\nwere when the film was\nmade, and when the book\nit is based on was written.\nThis, along with the\nfantastic acting, directing\nand script, is what makes\nthis such a classic film. I\u2019d\nargue.that 50 year\u2019s on,\nKubrick\u2019s A Clockwork\nOrange is a film which has\nyet to be surpassed.\nI highly recommend\nwatching it, not at home\non an iPad or laptop, but\non the big screen with\npopcorn in your lap and\na drink at your side. This\nis truly where this film\nbelongs and thankfully\ndue to its re-release you\nwill have that opportu-nity. Something I would\nlike to point out is that\nsome people may leave\naround halfway through\nas they believe the film\nis going to become \u2018even\nmore violent\u2019 however,\nthis is not the case, and\nit calms down in the\nsecond half. This is also\nwhere Kubrick ties the\nwhole film together with\nunderlying messages,\nas well as where my\nfavourite character is\nintroduced, Barnes (the\nchief prison guard), who\nhas a hilarious manner\nabout him, and is very\nold school British. In the\nsecond half there is also\nthe best prison scene I\nhave ever seen in a film,\nbetter than anything from\nShawshank, the highest\nregarded film ever (and\nthat was set in its entirety\nin a prison!) As films go,\nthis is one of the best; the\nacting, directing, sound\nand costume design are\nunparalleled and work\nreally well together,\nunlike some films released\nrecently.\nFind out more about\nthe Kubrick season at\nwww.bfi.org.uk\nThe Stanley Kubrick season comes to the BFI Southbank, running 1 April \u2013 31 May 2019.

In this guide to the West End, Arts\nWriter Eamon Akil Farhat gives us a flavour of what\u2019s\non at the moment, and why it might be even better\nvalue than we previously thought...\nW\nhen it comes\nto theatre,\nL o n d o n\nis an\ninternational capital of\nexcellence. Some would\nargue it offers the best of\nthe best when it comes\nto high quality cultural\nperformances. While\nmany have fallen under\nthe spell of the big musicals and gripping plays,\nalways yearning for their\nnext chance to get their\nWest End fix, others don\u2019t\nsee the hype, thinking it\ntacky, overpriced and \u201cnot\nfor me\u201d. Breaking down\nthese stereotypes and\nshowing that there truly is\nsomething for everyone is\nimportant to ensure this art\nform remains accessible\nto all. What better way to\ndo this than by exploring\nfour very different, hugely\nsuccessful musicals that\nyou can go and see today\non the West End?\nfind yourself in the seat\nof an iconic West End\nmusical. Though movies\nhave their charm, there\nis something very special\nabout seeing a performance live. Familiar\nsongs are belted out right\nin front of your eyes \u2013 no\nlip-syncing here! \u2013 and the\nsheer number of people is\nstupendous, from actors\nand the live band, to\nlighting technicians and\neven the understudies,\nensuring that the show\ngoes on every night. To\nadd to the drama of it all,\nthe beautiful old theatres\nin which the performance\ntake place will make you\nfeel like you\u2019re a member\nof the bourgeoisie, even if\nyou only paid a tenner for\nyour ticket! Here are four\nvery different musicals\nto give you a flavour for\nwhat\u2019s on...\nmagical genie and marry\na beautiful princess. The\nplot is hardly the raison\nd\u2019etre for this production,\nbut it definitely has other\nstrengths.\nThe opening of the performance is underwhelm-ing. Despite an innovative\nset, with swivelling\nhousing and minarets,\nthese first scenes fail to\ncapture the essence of\nthe hustle and bustle of\nthe market scene from\nthe movie. However, the\ngenie, played by Trevor\nDion Nicholas from the\noriginal Broadway cast,\nsaves the day with an\nelectric performance of\n\u2018Friend Like Me\u2019. Providing high-energy comedic\nrelief, he drops in references to everything from\nWakanda, Beauty and the\nBeast, and of course the\nChristina Aguilera classic,\n\u2018Genie in a Bottle\u2019.\nThe sets, costume and\nchoreography are the forte\nof this show. During a\ncouple of songs, no less\nthan ten costume changes\ncould be counted! With a\nbackdrop dripping with\ngold, actors parade in\ndressed like Vegas show-girls, before reappearing\nmoments later as tap\ndancers straight out of\n42nd\nStreet. In the palace,\nthe geometric Islamic art-styled walls add a level of\nelegance and simplicity to\na show that at times seem\na little ostentatious. To top\nit all off, the magic carpet\nflying through an enchanting starry sky leaves the\nentire audience in awe.\nThe only downside of this\nmagical moment is that\nthe carpet rather steals the\nshow, leaving the greatly\nanticipated \u2018A Whole\nNew World\u2019 something of\nan afterthought.\nis very different \u2013 and yet\nit instantly feels like a\nclassic. The central question \u2013 \u201cAre people born\nwicked or do they have\nwickedness thrust upon\nthem?\u201d \u2013 is explored with\na clear moral argument\norganically emerging in\na way that doesn\u2019t feel\nforced in the slightest.\nit is brought to life on the\nWest End stage by Alice\nFearn who takes it to new\nheights. This song comes\nat such a climatic point, it\nmakes Everest look like\na mere hill and, without\nwanting to give away too\nmuch, a certain greenified\nwitch might just defy\ngravity (just a little)!\nBeing a faraway land\n\u2013 outside Zone 2 most\nprobably \u2013 Oz must live\nup to its weird and wonderful credentials. During\na little weekend trip to the\nEmerald City, the locals\nare dressed like they came\nstraight out of the Capitol\nfrom The Hunger Games,\njust a little greener. The\ncostumes of the main\ncharacters, Glinda and\nElphaba in particular, are\nwhat you would expect;\nno bells or whistles, but\nthe simplicity lends itself\nwell to these classic characters which many would\nhave first met in the\nbeloved story The Wizard\nof Oz.\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 22ND\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX\n22\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201c\u2018Too\nexpensive\u2019or\n\u2018not for me\u2019are\nwhat many say\nwhen faced\nwith a trip to\nthe theatre\u201d\nARTS\nEamon Akil Farhat\nArts Writer\nBorn Wicked? // Just Opened London\nWhat?

Inspired by\nthe 2012 movie which\nwas itself inspired by this\nmusical, this production\nof Les Mis portrays the\ngrit, gore and miserable-ness of life in 19th century\nFrance. If you have read\nthe original books by\nVictor Hugo from the 19th\nCentury, you probably\ndon\u2019t have a much of a\nclue what is going on in\nthis notoriously confusing\nplot. The story follows\nJean Valjean, a convict on\nthe run who wants a clean\nslate. After the death of\none of his factory work-ers, Fantine, he agrees to\ntake her daughter Cosette\nunder his care. To really\nmake sure the story of\nthe orphaned girl whose\nmother died due to an\nunfortunate foray into\nprostitution is miserable\nenough, it is all set during\nthe June rebellion. This\nbattle sees many characters meet their fate on a\npoetically staged battle\non the barricades where\nscores of bodies are left to\nrest.\ntables, chairs and other\nprops can simply appear\nand disappear as the stage\nspins. There are no big\ncostume changes or huge\nsets, mostly due to the fact\nthat 19th\ncentury France\nwas quite uniform in its\ngloominess. This means\nthat transitions between\nscenes can take place very\nquickly and allow for a\ncontinuous and dynamic\nstory.

Long before\nthis, however, Eno was\ndoing something really\nquite different.\nHis musical career\nbegan in 1970, though not\nas a musician, when he\njoined groundbreaking art\nrock band Roxy Music as\na \u2018technical advisor\u2019. He\u2019d\nknown founder member\nAndy Mackay from their\ndays in art school where\nthe two hand bonded\nover their shared love\nof electronic music, and\nso when Mackay joined\nforces with singer Bryan\nFerry, he convinced Eno\nto come aboard. It was an\nodd appointment, as Eno\nplayed no instruments\nand had absolutely no\nmusical experience. What\nhe did bring to the table,\nhowever, was a reel-to-reel tape recorder and a\neye for experimentation.\nBefore long, Eno\nbecame an integral part\nof the band. Their debut\nalbum Roxy Music (1972)\nwas a genre-blending\nlandmark of creativity,\nfusing glam, prog, and\npop to form a symphonic\nwhirlwind of an LP. A\nconstant advocate for\nthe avant-garde, Eno\u2019s\ninfluence was strong; he\ncontributed synthesisers\nand tape effects that gave\ntheir music an otherworldly quality. On stage\nhe was a wizard. Cutting\nand manipulating tapes to\ndistort their sound in real\ntime. This, along with his\nflamboyant feather boas,\ngarnered him much atten-tion, despite never taking\ncentre stage. His presence\nwas only amplified on\ntheir second album For\nYour Pleasure (see Felix\nissue 1686), particularly\non the eerie and dystopian\nclosing track.\n\u201cIt was here\nthat he first\nchallenged\nthe norm and\nprobed what it\nreally meant to\nmake music\u201d\ntheir experimental artistry.\nFollowing their second\nalbum, White Light/White\nHeat, the tensions became\ntoo great, and Cale was\nacrimoniously given the\nboot.\nIt is fitting, or perhaps\nironic, therefore, that\nRoxy Music nigh on\nexactly replicated the path\ncarved by their idols.After\njust two albums, dashing\ncrooner Ferry began to\ntire of Eno the bohemian\nstealing the limelight, and\nwanted to take the band\nin more conventional\ndirections. Resistant to\nthis change, Eno departed\nciting creative differ-ences, leaving Ferry the\ndominant force. While\nboth Roxy and the Velvets\ncontinued to produce very\nfine music without their\nrespective renegades,\nit is certainly arguable\nthat something of their\noriginal creative flair\nwas lost. Coincidentally,\nthough not unsurprisingly,\nEno and Cale would later\ngo on to become firm\nfriends and collaborators,\neven recording an album\ntogether, 1990\u2019s Wrong\nWay Up.\nFree of restrictions,\nEno allowed his creative\ntendencies to run wild.\nHis debut solo album\nHere Come the Warm\nJets was released in\nJanuary 1974, though it\nwas anything but solo in\nnature. A thread that was\nto run through the rest of\nhis career, Eno enlisted\na whole host of collab-orators, including all\nmembers of Roxy Music\n(bar Ferry), and King\nCrimson guitarist Robert\nFripp, with whom he had\nrecently recorded the\nexperimental noisescape\n(No Pussyfooting). Recording techniques were\nas unconventional as you\nwould imagine, with Eno\noften directing musicians\nto swap instruments, or\ngiving instructions solely\nthrough the medium of\ndance. For those who\nknow Brian Eno only for\nhis ambient work, the\ninitial shockwave hits\nimmediately in the form\nof a throbbing distorted\nguitar. Shortly afterwards,\nwe find out that Eno can\nsing. And boy, can he\nsing! The first side is\nfrenetic and high-octane.\nWith conventional song\nstructures out the window,\nhooks and choruses are in\nshort supply, while feed-back-driven instrumentals\n(notably Fripp\u2019s sublime\nguitar work on \u2018Baby\u2019s\nOn Fire\u2019) are aplenty.\nCryptic lyrics act more\nas impressionistic word\ndecorations than narrative\ndevices, with Eno\u2019s voice\nveering between distant\ndrones and staccato snarls.\nAs the noise of sinister\nnursery rhyme \u2018Driving\nMe Backwards\u2019 draws to\na close, we hit a change\nof gear. The piano-led\nballad \u2018On Some Faraway\nBeach\u2019 is by far the most\ntender moment on the LP,\nits simplistic yet evocative\nlyrics (\u201cUnlikely I\u2019ll be\nremembered / as the tide\nbrushes sand in my eyes /\nI\u2019ll drift away\u201d) ushering\nin an unexpected moment\nof clarity and vulnerabil-ity. Following this prec-edent, the second side is\nmusically lighter, favouring synths over guitars.\nIt\u2019s here that we can see\nthe seeds of his minimalist\napproach begin to germi-nate, though it wouldn\u2019t\nsport its first flower until\nDiscreet Music, just short\nof two years later.\nHere Come the Warm\nJets is a peculiar yet extraordinary stepping stone\nin Eno\u2019s career. It was here\nthat he first challenged\nthe norm and probed\nwhat it really meant to\nmake music, the resulting\nalbum being more akin to\na Dadaist vignette than\na pop-rock record. After\na string of ever more\nexperimental solo albums,\nhe soon found himself\nengaging in landmark\ncollaborations with David\nBowie and Talking Heads,\nand behind the boards\nproducing for the likes of\nDevo, U2, and Coldplay\n(we all make mistakes).\nHis gargantuan influence\non the musical landscape\nreally cannot be understat-ed, and he\u2019s still churning\na regular output to this\nday. Seemingly without\neven trying, everything he\ntouches turns to gold.\nBrian? What does\u2018e know?! // Island\nFrontman Bryan Ferry\n(along with just about\neveryone who knew them)\ndrew much inspiration\nfrom 60s proto-punk band\nthe Velvet Underground.\nThe story of their early\ndays is one of a great\npower struggle and fierce\nrivalry between two\nextraordinary musicians.\nVocalist and primary\nsongwriter Lou Reed\nwas, for the most part, a\nstraight forward NewYork\nrock and roll type with\ninsatiable charisma. By\ncontrast, fellow bandmate\nJohn Cale was a reclusive\nviola-playing Welshman.\nThe two grappled to take\nthe band in different di-rections. Reed, frustrated\nby their lack of commercial success, wanted to\npull them towards the\nmainstream, while Cale\nsought to further nourish\n\n"

She bravely uses\nher platform to raise\nawareness of mental\nhealth problems in new\nmothers, half of whom\nare said to experience it\nin their lives. This play is\nan eye-opening statement\non a problem that is\nunderreported and un-derdiagnosed, likely due\nto stigma and traditional\nideas of motherhood.\nThe play centres around\none such character, Em,\nwhom we meet on a train\nplatform, along with what\nshe thinks is a stranger\u2019s\nbaby. This baby becomes\nher audience, with whom\nshe begins to share her\nlife\u2019s story, her confes-sions, her secrets \u2013 and\nwe, as the real audience,\nare privy to all this. She\ntakes us on a journey\nthrough her turbulent,\ntraumatic childhood and\ndisappointing marriage,\nlittering the dialogue with\nmoments of sombreness\nand bursts of dark humour.\nThis is what I especially\nloved \u2013 despite the seriousness of the content,\nit is deeply witty; even\nwith dark subject matter\nthere are light moments.\nSometimes it is genuinely\ncomic; other times, Em is\nusinghumourtoglossover\ndamaging life experiences\nwith a blas\u00e9 tone and\nsarcastic quip, nervously\nlaughing the way people\ndo when they talk about\nsomething uncomfortable.\nIt is techniques like\nthis that allow this play to\nfunction so successfully\nas a one-woman play;\nalthough there are no other\ncharacters to interact with,\nthere is never any dullness\nor struggle to keep the\naudience engaged. Even in\nthe necessary moments of\nsilence, there is a gravity\nand intention behind\nthe choice, where the\naudience can absorb the\nwords and the emotions.\nThis is all thanks to\nHarper, because since she\nboth writes and performs\nthe piece, she is able to\npresent it authentically,\nexactly as intended.\nThe way she naturally\ncommunicates is so raw\nand vulnerable; there is\na fascinating \u2018stream of\nconsciousness\u2019 feel to the\nwhole thing. Whilst it\nwas humour that engaged\nthe audience and kept us\nlistening, I\u2019m sure we all\nleft having been touched\nby themes that we could\nrelate to \u2013 loneliness,\nstruggle, fear, despera-tion, resilience, courage,\nand overcoming hurdles \u2013\neven if the exact situation\nitself wasn\u2019t shared by all.\nAt the end of the play,\nHarper says a few words\nabout how the story is\ninspired by a real woman\nshe met who shared her\nexperiences with postnatal mental health. To me,\nthis highlighted the very\nreal nature of the play,\nand that the content was\nnot just entertainment,\nbut a wonderful starter for\nmeaningful conversations\nabout mental health.\nHighly recommended!\nDon Quixote \u2013 A Sizzling Spanish Comedy\nD\non Quixote is\na sumptuous\ndelve into\nSpain through\nMiguel de Cervante\u2019s\nclassic story. It follows\nthe eccentric Don who,\nthrough reading too many\nold tales, believes he is\na knight and goes out\nseeking adventure with\nhis faithful squire Sancho.\nTheir misadventures\ninvolve helping young\nlovers Kitri and Basilio\nevade Lorenzo (her\nfather) and Gamache\n(the proposed suitor). It\u2019s\nhardly smooth sailing for\nthe pair, but all ends well\nin an impressive final\nwedding scene.\nCarlos Acosta\u2019s daring\nnew choreography for\nthe Royal Ballet was\nintroduced in 2013\nalongside the fantastic\nscore by Ludwig Minkus.\nThe sumptuous music\ntransports you to the\nMediterranean and was\nwonderfully conducted on\nthe night by Martin Yates.\nAcosta wished to show off\nthe full cast in this large-scale ballet, so alongside\nthe traditional solos and\npas de deux, there are\nmany marvellous group\nsections for the corps de\nballet.\nThroughout the night\nit was a delight to watch\nKitri (Marianela Nu\u00f1ez)\nand Basilio (Vadim Muntagirov). Both gave truly\noutstanding performances\nwith great characterisation\nand impressive technique.\nNu\u00f1ez perfectly achieved\nthe remarkable 32 fouett\u00e9s\nin Act III, travelling en\npointe, escalating grand\njet\u00e9s and effortlessly held\nthe many balances. All\nthis whilst lighting up the\naudience with her radiant\nsmile. Muntagirov caused\nthe audience to gasp with\nhis remarkable split leaps,\ndisplayed impressive\npirouettes and jumps,\nand conveyed elegance in\nevery moment.\nThe level of trust and\ntogetherness shown by\nthe pair was revealed in\nthe final pas de deux, with\nthe incredibly difficult\n\u2018fish dives\u2019 seemingly\neffortless.\nAlongside them were\na number of standout\nperformances. Kitri\u2019s\ncheery friends, played by\nYuhui Choe and Beatriz\nStix-Brunell, pulled off\nthe difficult pas de deux.\nLaura Morera portrayed\na delightfully flirtatious\nMercedes alongside\nRyoichi Hirano\u2019s arrogant\nEspada. During the\ndream sequence of Act\nII, Fumi Kaneko made\nthe complex routine as\nQueen of the Dryads seem\neffortless with delightful\nextensions, and Anna\nRose O\u2019Sullivan provided\na wonderfully exuberant\nAmour.\nAnother highlight was\nbrought by the corps de\nballet in the gypsy scene\nat the start of Act II \u2013 the\nmore contemporary repertoire delightfully brought\nit to life.\nThis performance\nrequires just as much\ntalented acting as it does\ndancing. In this vein Don\nQuixote (Christopher\nSaunders), Sancho Panza\n(David Yudes), Lorenzo\n(Gary Avis) and Gamache\n(Bennet Gartside) are\nbrilliantly performed,\nbringing real moments\nof comedy to the stage.\nYudes in particular had\nwonderful comedic\ntiming.\nAt times Acosta\u2019s\nambitious choreography\ncan leave the stage feeling\ncrowded, with almost\ntoo many things to see\nat once. This combined\nwith Tim Hatley\u2019s moving\nset, although beautifully\nsetting the scene, can\nat times be distracting.\nHowever, despite these\nthings, it is a brilliant\nmove in modern ballet,\nreenergising the perceived\nstiffness of classical\nballets.\nThis vibrant and highly\ncomedic production,\ncombined with the\namazing talent of Nu\u00f1ez\nand Muntagirov is definitely one not to miss.\nRachel Harper is brilliant as\u2018Em\u2019 // Ali Wright\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nWhere?

This is undeniably\nracist; he saw black men\nas indistinguishable and,\ntherefore, killing any\nblack man would do. This\nplays into a wider narrative of black people, men\nin particular, being viewed\nas aggressive, violent and\nsavage criminals. Sadly,\nthese kinds of views are\nfar more common than\nthey should be and, whilst\nthere has been progress,\nit has been painstakingly\nslow. A key question that\nwe need to answer is what\nto do when confronted\nwith these individuals?\nNeeson has been\nwidely condemned for\nhaving held these views,\nand rightly so. Any form\nof racism needs to be\nchallenged. However,\nthere is a risk of forming\na mob mentality. This\nincident happened 40\nyears ago and Neeson\nhas expressed his regret\nfor holding these views\nand has made it clear he\ndoes not hold them now.\nIt is essential that people\nwho have these views\ncan seek and obtain\nredemption. The logical\nconsequence if we don\u2019t\nis a world in which a\nsignificant minority of\nthe population is castigated and excluded from\nsociety with no hope of\ntruly participating in it.\nWhat is the benefit of\ntrying to reform if you\nknow that you\u2019ll still be\ncalled racist over something you can no longer\ndo anything about?\nThese individuals\u2019 views\nwill only harden and\npersist, sewing further\ndivision and hatred. Far\nbetter is to have an open\ndialogue about why\npeople hold these views\nand ultimately why they\nare wrong. This is a\nprocess that Neeson has\nprobably gone through\nconsidering he has since\nchanged his views but,\nsince he has made this\npublic, it would be good\nfor him to discuss the\njourney he has been on.\nThere is no obligation on\nhim to do so but, having\nrecognised the mistakes\nthat he has made, he is\nin the perfect position\nto help others take the\nsame steps. We should\nultimately champion\nindividuals who are able\nto better themselves\nthis way, not because\nit is a desirable path to\ntake but as a beacon for\nracists to show them\nthere is a way out of\ntheir antiquated views\nand into the 21st\ncentury.\nWe can belligerently\nscream at the top of our\nlungs calling out racists\nand the like but it\u2019s important to understand the\nsocial situation people\nfind themselves in.\nNeeson grew up during\nthe troubles in Ireland\nwhere, if a Catholic\nwere killed, revenge\nwould be taken by attacking a member of the\nProtestant community\nregardless of whether\nthat individual was\ninvolved or not. This\nnaturally doesn\u2019t excuse\nracist behaviour, but we\nare all products of our\nenvironments and to\nbring about real change,\nthis is a fundamental\naspect that needs to be\naddressed. What Neeson\nsaid should be used as\nan opportunity to talk\nabout the persecution\nthat ethnic minoritie,\nand in particular black\nmen, still face today.\nEven in the UK, the\nsystem appears to be\nstacked against them.\nFrom rates of poverty\nto harsher criminal\nsentences to the court\nof public opinion, black\nmen are often put at a\nsignificant disadvantage\nto their white counter-parts. This is entrenched\nin the UK system, going\nback decades and will\ntake concerted effort to\nchange. The Windrush\nscandal is a case in point.\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely\nthat we would even be\nhaving this problem if it\ninvolved white migrants\nrather than black.\nAn example of\nwhere change should\nbe possible is Shannon\nGabriel, the West Indian\ncricketer, who was\nrecently banned for four\nmatches for throwing\nhomophobic abuse in the\nway of England\u2019s cricket\ncaptain, Joe Root. He\nhas since released a\nletter explaining what\nhappened from his point\nof view and how he\nnow recognises it was a\nmistake. He will serve\nhis punishment and,\nhopefully afterwards,\nwill never use that kind\nof abuse on or off a\ncricket pitch. I also hope\nthat he won\u2019t be tarnished as homophobic\nfor the rest of his career\nwhen he has shown clear\ncontrition for his horrendous actions. Racists\nshould face justice in\nwhatever form; actions\nshould have conse-quences. Beyond this,\nthey should have the\nability to be reintegrated\ninto society. Society has\na role for facilitating this\nand a world in which\nthere are fewer racists\nis a world we must all\naspire towards.\nThose of us who are\nliberal and fundamentally believe that people\nshould be able to be who\nthey are, whether this is\nto do with their sexual\norientation, religion,\nethnicity, etc., without\nthe risk of attack and\npersecution will prevail\nover bigotry. However,\nwe must be careful to\navoid being entirely\nintolerant of intolerance\nfor we run the risk of\nmaking a bad situation\nworse. We live in a\ndeeply divided world\nwhich can feel like a\npowder keg ready to\nexplode. The only way\nto bridge this growing\ndivide is through\ndialogue and showing\nthat there is a path to\nredemption.\nI have a particular set of skills // Wikimedia\n\n"

When are we going to tell them enough is enough?\nCOMMENT\nAbhijay Sood\nComment Writer\nW\nith only\na week\u2019s\nn o t i c e ,\nCollege has\ntold us they\u2019re shutting\nthe pub menu food service\nin h-bar. This is the latest\nin a long line of cuts:\nthey\u2019ve hiked up the fee\nat Ethos, they came after\nthe SCR breakfast and the\npool at St. Mary\u2019s, and\nthey\u2019ve raised the price of\nfood on campus and rent\nin halls every year. While\nthis might not be their\nmost egregious decision,\nfor me it\u2019s the straw that\u2019s\nbroken the camel\u2019s back.\nTheir justification for\nthis change is that the\nfood service was costing\nCollege around \u00a320k a\nmonth to maintain. It is\nunclear as to whether\nthis figure includes the\nrent College \u201ccharges\nitself\u201d to use the kitchen\nspace, as they do for labs\nin departments. It is also\nunclear whether this is\nnet of College\u2019s share of\nthe profits from drinks\nsales, which are divided\nwith the Union. In other\nwords, they may be\noverstating their costs\nand understating their\nprofits: we\u2019ve yet to\nbe presented with clear\nnumbers in writing.\nHowever, even if we\nwere to take their \u00a320k\nfigure at face value,\nan effective subsidy\nof under a quarter of a\nmillion pounds per year\nis small change on the\nscale of the institution.\nLast year, we ran an\n\u00a380m surplus, and hold\nin reserve \u00a31.6bn.\nNobody\u2019s arguing that\nwe have an unlimited\namount of money to\nspend: we need to be\nfinancially solvent. But\nwe are a university, not\na corporation. We have a\nduty to be motivated by\nconsiderations beyond\nthe bottom line.\nh-bar is one of the\nfew outlets on campus\ndedicated to postgrads;\nwhere staff and students\nare often seen dining\ntogether. For a university that struggles to\nengender a sense of\ncommunity, particularly\nbetween its staff and\nstudents, withdrawing\nthis service in a manner\nwhich could soon lead\nto the bar being closed\nentirely - consider\nwhat\u2019ll happen to drinks\nsales once the food is\ngone - is irresponsible.\nSupporting such a\nservice, the beneficiaries\nof which are otherwise\nunder-served, at the cost\nof some tiny fraction of\nour surplus (if indeed\nthis is the case), is by no\nmeans disproportionate.\nThe other troubling\naspect of College\u2019s\ndecision is in how it was\ncommunicated. Despite\ntheir claim that conversations with the Union\nhave been ongoing\nfor eight months, the\nsabbatical officers\ndidn\u2019t know anything\nuntil after College had\nalready decided to cut\nthe service a week or two\nago, and the bar staff had\nno idea until even more\nrecently. Given that the\nbar has historically been\nrun jointly (food by the\nCollege, drinks by the\nUnion) with any profits\nshared, this unilateral\nmove is outrageous and\ndemonstrative of the\nlack of respect the de-cision-makers here hold\nfor the Union and, by\nextension, the student\nbody.\nI believe that this\ndecision should be\nhalted until a more\nthorough dialogue has\ntaken place between\nour heads - without\nproper forethought and\nto the exclusion of the\npeople that are affected\nby them - I would urge\nyou to contact the\nProvost, Ian Walmsley,\nat provost@imperial.\nac.uk, and ask him to\nhalt this. It would be\nextremely helpful if\nyou encouraged your\nstaff members to do the\nsame: senior management are more likely to\nlisten to them than us.\nBeyond that, please sign\nthe online petition at\ntiny.cc/hbar and let the\nuniversity know they\ncannot keep making\nthese decisions with\nimpunity.\n\u201cWithdrawing this service in manner which could soon lead to the bar being closed entirely is irresponsible\u201d// Imperial College London\nall relevant parties.\nThis includes (but is\nnot limited to) College\nmanagement, the Union,\ngraduate students and\nstaff. The service need\nnot remain unchanged,\nbut we should not allow\ndecisions like this to be\nmade unilaterally and\nsprung on us at the last\nminute, not as students\nand especially not as\npartners. That\u2019s no way\nto run a large organisa-tion.\nThis may not affect\nall of us directly, but\nwe have to draw the\nline somewhere. If you,\nlike me, are sick of the\nuniversity making these\nkinds of decisions over\n\n"
