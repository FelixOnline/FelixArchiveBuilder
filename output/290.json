Ut Aoi o ii h.it i The \"Education Prograrme\" on BSC last Sunday comprised a discussion in which the chair press de the following points: that there is a great\nanomaly between the\" financial support for a student in a University and for one in another institute of higher education, and that this anomaly may be\nremoved by introducing a\" comprehensive \" scheme and spending more money\non higher education at the expense of the .Universities,\nMy answer to this argument is that..,.\nIt is true that more money is needed for non-university higher education\non the grounds that it caters for more students, but NOT at the expense of\nUniversity education.\nThe reasons lie in basic economics. The amount of money spent on\neducating a student should be related to the financial return, which may be\nmeasured as a function of:( a) his contribution to the country in his future employment\n(b) his contribution to the advancement of technology.\nThe greatest advances in research are ara de by groups of people with\nsimilar specialist interests, where expensive equipment may be used with\nmaximum fce tur on capital investment. Should these groups be ' diluted' and\nultimately destroyed by a comprehensive system where one institution comprises many t yoe s of college-, research will suffer. Students are the most able to diversify their interests. Instead of\nconcentrating on this sector, less money could be used to better advantage\nby diversifying the interests of the whole population, while preserving the\na cade wi c special is ation of our uni vers 5 ti&s i be a more academic and open mass midi a system\nand more efficient to extend this mode oF diversification t< concentrate on the sector most able to broaden Its inter ets For reasons of space this letter has been shortened.

    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 12th March, 1970\nPresidential Candidate JOHN\nDARLEY speaks...\nJohn Darley is a third\nyear maths student and this\nyear has been chairman of\nthe Athletic clubs commit-tee. During the past year he\nhas been an active member\nof council and has contributed to a number of working\nparties including the one\nwhich prepared the Union\nQuinquennium policy state-ment.\nThis, in particular, has allowed John to get a useful\ninsight into the problems facing the students of I.C. and\nalso into the ways in which\nthese might be overcome.\nWith regard to particular\ntopics of discussion, such as\nstudent representation on college committees, diversification of studies etc. John's views are generally in line\nwith I.C.U. policy. He feels\nthat a great deal of enthusiasm has been generated this\nyear and it is essential that\nthis is maintained in the\ncoming year. It would be\ntragic, he thinks, if the ideas\nand aims of the students\nwhich have appeared this\nyear, go unfulfilled due to\napathy or lack of interest.\nMany people will probably\nfeel that John's lack of political motivation in the college will hinder him in his\npresidential duties. It is true,\nof course, that his chief interest has always been in the\nsporting rather than political\nfields, however, he himself\nfels that his having no strongly directed political views will\nenable him to consider all the\naspects of any problem un-biased ly. John thinks that\neven more progress could\nhave been made in the\nchanges that have come this\nyear if a willingness, not\nnecessarily to compromise,\nbut merely to consider other\npoints of view had been more\nevident.\nDiversification\nThe case for diversification\nhas been discussed considerably this year but no clear\ncut decision of what is needed has been reached. This\nis obviously because the\nstructure of I.C, with its\nmany different departments,\nmakes it impossible for a general policy to be laid\ndown. The students of some\ndepartments, particularly in\nR.S. M., are quite content\nwith their courses whereas\nothers, especially in the pure\nsciences, strongly feel that a more diverse course of studies would be of greater use\nto them.\nAs far as student representation on college committees goes the case can best\nbe summed-up by two ques-t ions. Are the students on the\ncommittee of use to the com-mitte e? Are the decisions of\nthe committee of any interest to the student body? If\nthe answer to these two\nquestions is yes then there is\nobviously a strong case for\nstudent representation on\nthat particular committee.\nSabbatical\nIt is obvious by the activity of the students in the\nunion that the union is in a healthy condition. What is\nneeded next year is a president who will maintain this\nenthusiasm and use it to\ngreatest effect to gain student aims. John Darley\nknows the problems. He will\nlisten to suggestions from\nboth sides without bias. He\nthinks the introduction of a sabbatical year has made the\npost of president a professional job and looks on it in\nthis light.\nPaper-Dart\nCompetition\nOn Tuesday, March 17th, at 1.00 p.m. Aero Soc will\nbe holding the annual Paper\nDarts Competition, in aid of\nCarnival, from Tizard Hall\ngallery. The event is open to\nanyone who is capable of\ndesigning, constructing and\nlaunching a dart. The entry\nfee is 1/-.\nDarts may be constructed\nof paper, cardboard, glue\nand sell o tape only and must\nbe of a recognised dart\nshape.\nThe winning dart will be\nthe one which goes furthest,\nat right angles, from South\nSide. This dart will be carefully preserved and the win-ner's name will do down in\nCollege history.\nThe winner will receive\nhalf of the money taken, the\nother half will be donated\nto Carnival.\nThe dart at present undergoing final tests in the Aero\nHypersonics Lab. is hot favourite but anything can happen in the difficult wind conditions around South Side.\nCome along and have\nsome fun. hope to see you\nthere.\nPhil's View I.C. Buskers in 'High St., Kensington\nR. C.S.U. Meeting\nAt 1.15 p.m.,3 rd March,\nas the volume of background\nnoise rose to the level it was\nto maintain for most of the\nmeeting, John Butterworth\nread the previous minutes\nand a letter from Sir Solly\nZuckermann, who will not\nbe speaking at the R.C.S. Dinner.\nA vote decided that both\nthe presidential election (P. Cunningham 23, R. Abdulla\n29, P. Sharkey 140, Abstentions 116, Spoilt papers 25)\nand those for Vice President\nand Secretary were invalid,\nand, after some argument,\ndates for the next election\nwere announced by Penny\nWalters; nomination papers\n12 to 18 March, listings 21\nApril, election 27 April.\nThere were complaints about\nthe conduct of the elections;\nincluding bad advertising\nand organising and the\nWith Union elections pending I would like to express\nthe views of a poor student\nfor the consideration of can-di dates. I would like to see Imperial College welded into a true unit and get rid of the\n' them and us' attitude which\nis becoming prevalent. If we\ncan meet the policy makers\nand show them that what we\nwant is reasonable, then I have no doubt that we will\nachieve a lot more than we\nwould by embarrassing them.\nWhy do we have to follow\nthe sheep who think that we\nhave to fight for everything\nbefore it is worthwhile? I believe that we could set a lead to other colleges by\ncreating a truly equal society\nat I.C. \u2014 a place where students staff and governors are\nworking together and helping one another. Separatism\ncan only lead to strife, and\nwhen that happens we will\nfind ourselves fighting a running battle where we have\nlittle to gain and a lot to\nlose. A good starting point\nin a policy of integration is\nJURGO. This contains the\nRector, three governors, the\nthree College Deans, a warden and four members of\nstaff. It also contains the\nPresident and treasurer of\nI.C. Union and ten members\nof I.C. Union Council. What\nbetter way could there be of\nalleged removal of a ballot\nbox.\nA general call for the mascot resulted only in the\nlights being dimmed for\nfighting, but eventually N. Powell was carried to the\nfront, to say that he had\nmislaid Theta. During a brief\nlull in the ensuing flood of\nsuggestions, it was noticed\nthat the meeting had passed\nto the next business, a motion condemning obscene\nlanguage at Union meetings,\nmany examples of which\nwere provided from the floor\nto assist the proposer, but\nhe successfully interrupted\nthem with considerable vocal\npower. There followed an\nacademic discussion on\nvocabulary definitions by P. Ferndale and B. Pywell, and,\nat 2.00 p.m., the meeting finally faded out with two\nKangelas.\ngetting things done than to\ndiscuss them with the people\nwho in the end will implement them?\nUnion meetings have met\nwith a lot of criticism lately\nand I would propose that\nthey be conducted in a more\nordered fashion. They should\nbe started punctually and\nshould have AT LEAST the\nPresident and Secretary of\nthe Union as well as the\nthree constituent College\nPresidents in attendance,\nwith as many members of\nCouncil as possible. Meetings should discuss subjects\nwhich are of direct interest\nto the majority of students,\nbecause if I.C. students don't participate in their own\nUnion they w f ll never be\ngiven the opportunity to participate in running academic\naffairs. In other words, let's draw more students and less\nexternal politics into Union\nmeetings. Fewer meetings\nmight make people take\nmore notice when they did\narise provided that information on current trends could\nbe efficiently disseminated.\nPerhaps it would be possible\nto set up a regular Union\nnew sheet for this purpose\nwith established College\nnewspapers running articles\non the more important topics\nwhich arise.\nPeople \u2014 not politics.\nLet's have a REAL Union!\nPhil Fearnhead\nMines\nElections\nResults\nTerry Stephenson was elected unopposed as the new\npresident of RS M. Stephenson first came to IC in 1966\nwith the misguided intention\nof doing Mechanical Engineering. After three years, he\nsaw the light and entered\nMining II last October.\nHe believes that R SMU should be apolitical, he intends to preserve the essential character of the RS M but also to expand it by forging stronger links with Institute Francais, Maria\nAssumpta, etc.\nThere was however, competition for some of the\nother posts. Mike Moore was\nelected as Vice-president,\nsomewhat surprising as\nGeorge Widelski, the well\nknown successful Hon. Pornographer, stood in opp osi tion.\nThe elections ended with\na revolting display by M. Gowers, the new Hon. Pornographer who regurgitated\nthe beer he had just drunk\nfrom his enamel potty!\nPresidential Candidate BRIAN\nHAINS speaks...\nThere are four main areas\nwith which a student union\nshould be concerned. These\nare (a) to cater for the recreational needs of students,\n(b) to improve the nature\nand presentation of their\nacademic work, (c) to encourage students to become\naware of the society of which\nthey are a part, and (d) to\nnegotiate with the college administration on behalf of the\nstudent body.\nThe recreational strength\nof the union resides mainly\nin its clubs. The only direct\ncontact that many students\nmake with their union is\nthrough the clubs. Every\neffort should be made to\nchannel more money into\nAC C,RC C and SCC, and to\nencourage the clubs to realise their full potential. To\nmake the clubs more successful it is essential to have\nmore women and non-scientists around IC, at present\nthis can most easily be done\nthrough the USK. Opportunities should be provided in\nthe first week of term to encourage USK people to join\nIC clubs.\nThe development of an atmosphere of understanding\nand cooperation between\nteacher and taught is essential for student involvement\nin academic matters. With\nactive support and encouragement from the students,\nusing the staff-student committee as a base, I feel that\nmany improvements can be\nreadily made if the students\nprovide the initiative. It is\nvitally important that the\npower in the departments\nshould be spread more evenly throughout the teaching\nstaff, students can profitably\ncollaborate with the AUT in\nthis. The end result of all\nthese moves would be a much\nbetter standard of teaching.\nParticipation\nStudents are now eligible\nto vote. How conscious are\nthey of the issues on which\nthey will be required to pass\na judgement? The union\nmust do all it can to make\nstudents aware of the workings of the society that they\nwill soon be entering. Ways\nin which this could be achieved would be through participation in community\naction projects, and through\nthe NUS. For example, NUS\nare forever trying to show\nhow universities relate to the\nwhole educational system,\nand to the needs they are\nsupposed to be satisfying.\nThere are many points of\ncurrent union policy over\nwhich there is a deadlock between the students and the\nadministration. It must be\nremembered, however, that\ndecisions made at union\nmeetings or on the Governing Body are seldom ir rev o cable. There are some areas,\nfor example, where I feel that\nif we ask for a little less than\nwhat we have been demand-ing, then we shall accrue\nseveral immediate benefits.\nIn my stay at IC I have\nbeen involved with Astro.\nSoc, USK, SCC Exec, Community Action, staff-student\ncommittees, and, of course,\nIC Academic Affairs Committee. I have observed on\nthe Governing Body, Finance and Executive Committee, and have been continually involved with the senior\nmembers of the college ad-ministration. Backed up with\nthis experience I believe\nthat I can present the students case to the best advantage of the students.\n\n"

I don't think people are very clear of what the\ncandidates.moan, but the implications of what they say are that :\ni. This year there has not been 'talk and negotiation* .\nii. The Union has been 'too militant1 \u201e\niii. The President has been 'too militant1. Well, dealing with these in turn i.I have spent a very large amount of time\nevery week of the year talking and ne got i at i;/ xth the administration and\nhave successfully negotiated for instance, money f.'.r ICU to join NUS, money\nfor a sabbatical year for the President, an increased salary for the Union\nClerk, representation and many and various committees etc... there is mere\nto come! I( Union foe etc).. This negotiating requires a great -leal of\nspecialist knowledge and know-how, NUS and other colleges are involved in providing information, and the President must know how to get hold of the\ninformation.\nFurther I arranged for, and encouraged, departmental representatives and the\nAcadenic Affairs Officer etc.. to talk arid discuss with academic staff. I have also had discussion meetings with academic staff, even though this is not the main job of the President (he has not got time) - the Academic\nAffairs officer concentrates on it. ii,. It is for the Union to decide what it does \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 not for the President to\nveto its discussions - either this year or ne::t year!\nHi. Anything 'militant' I have suggested this year has always been approved\nby Union (or Counci l)..... which brings us back to ii,i Of course the President can initiate some action and J have done so. For\ninstance, it was my personal decision( later applaud ec by the Union) to\ndistribute copies of the June Doard of Studies rc in ute r,w iii chem barras ed the\nProfessors who had spoken strongly against student rep-e sent ation. I am\ncertain that this action greatly Speeded up the normally very slow discussion\n\" in academic circles, so the moderate Professors have now spoken and the\nDoard of Studies had 'decided t.o decide' on representation instead of deciding\nagainst again* We also furthered the cause of junior staff who are now\nbetter represented on tha Board of Studies, \u2022\u2022cry large IT due to the Union's efforts, If we had not distributed the em barra ring minutes and sc forced a great deal\nof public discussion, we and the Junic staff would be v here we were back in June. Similar successful actions took place this year e.g. Moritorium,\nRefectory Boycott. Similar actions will almost certainly be necessary next\nyear. So the. Union must have a President with the political know-how to be\nable to decide when to initiate such activity and action and how.\nThis brings me to a general point about community discussion and negotiation. It is the mark of a healthy community that there is extensive public discussion. Public discussion in IC is this year higher than ever before.\nThis public discussion is effectively generated by action and activity and\ncontributes in an absolutely vital way to the backing of anybody (e.g. President) involved in negotiation \u2022\n\u2022 it has greatly helped the Union this year.\nNext year, if the Union stops moving, disc u^ ii on will stop and negotiations\nwill fail. Politician The President of the students' union - now a sabbatical post, is a highly political one - and can never be anything eJ se. Members of the\nAdministration have, generally had about 30 years of political experience\n( in administration and organisation of people and policies etc). The\nStudents Union President must have the political k nov.' how and contacts to\neffectively discuss and negotiate with then icI have about 4 years of political experience (some of it outside I.C.) and have found it very useful. continued,...\n\n"

Carnival\nConcert held recently before\na capacity crowd heralded\nthe approach of spring with\ntemperatures in the nineties.\nWas this due to excitation\nprovided by the performers\nor the atmosphere generated\nby a small but dedicated\nband of smokers? The Organgrinders of the event and\nthe Domestic Burper eagerly\nawait your replies, answer\n(a) for the former, (b) for\nthe latter, (c) for Raquel\nWelch, and (d) if you would\nlike to attend D.B.'s confessional held every Thursday\nevening in College Block, at\nno extra cost.\nThe concert was started\noff by Principal Edwards\nMagic Theatre. First impressions were good, here is\nsomething new; the music of\ntoday complemented by visual images provided by slide\nprojection and vibrant human forms. The first numbers\nwere stimulating but as the\nnovelty of the event wore\noff so the favourable impression died and one was positively relieved when the last\nnote sounded and the last\nlimb came to inevitable rest.\nThough the light show was,\nfor the most part, good the\nmusic was poor and the\ndancing, with a few noticeable exceptions, was ama-te u rish.A presentation of\nthe most tremendous potential which was put over\nrather badly; a great idea\nthat with more polish could\nprovide entertainment par\nexcellence.\nThere followed an exp los ion, two loin and .lu r ry car-toons, and an interval. One\nfeels it must be pointed out\nto the Organgrinders of the\nevent what a good idea it\nmight have been if whilst\nthe audience were watching\nthat particular Tom and\nJerry cartoon for the twenty\nthird time they, the Organgrinders of the event, might\nhave been preparing the\nstage for the next group.\nAlas this was not to be and\nan intermission extraordinary was duly enacted.\nSo at last and finally,\nDeep Purple, though seemingly it was only with reluctance that the Organgrinders\nof the event dimmed the\nhouse lights. What was undoubtedly an excellent performance by Deep Purple\nfor anyone listening was\nspoilt by several splendid\npieces of equipment failure.\nDuring these forced 'breaks'\nthe lead singer, well-known\nfor his devastating wit and\namazing repartee, held the\naudience in a trance. Apart\nfrom these set-backs the performance was up to Deep\nPurple's usual standard, the\nlead guitarist excelling.\nOne thing was very apparent from the evenings enter-tain ment, that Albert Hall\noriented groups do not appreciate what good acoustics can do given half a chance which is what they\ncertainly did not get. Highlight of the evening; the\nend.\nSeriously, folks, well worth\na visit next time (wear something cool and bring some\ncotton wool), but please\nOrgangrinders of the event\nlet's have the volume down\na bit. Deep Purple on stage\nCARDINAL HEENAN AT I.C. Cardinal Heenan visited the College to give a general\nstudies lecture on the role of Christianity in the modern world.\nHe spent very little time speaking on the subject of the lec-ture, his main point being that Christians should share the\nexperience of their faith.\nEuthenasia\nHe touched on several topics and spent much of the lecture\nattacking an article by Dennis Potter in the Times. Of more\ninterest than this was his strong opposition to the idea of\neuthanasia which he said the humanist lobby in parliament\nwas attempting to introduce. He believed that this would\nmake the doctor an executioner. As the doctors were under\nthe control of the state, he maintained that eventually the\nstate would exterminate not only the old but also the aw k ward.\nDecline\nSeveral questions were put to the Cardinal and he showed\nmuch skill in skating the awkward ones.\nHe said that he thought that religion was on a decline but\nhe believed as a Christian that good would triumph over\nevil and that religion would survive.\nJ.

Remember 'On The\nWaterfront' and the young\ntough Newman. Today we\nhave still the tough one, but\nhe's beginning to use his\nbrain and to good effect, viz.\nhis great achievement in directing 'Rachel Rachel'. So\nmuch for the ingredients of\n'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid'.\nTension\nSome of the critics have\ncompared it to 'Bonnie and\nClyde', but it's really completely different in approach,\nstyle and setting. This is a western not a cops and robbers movie. The essential\npart is the chase of Butch\nand Sundance by a relentless\nmarshall, an expert Indian\ntracker and four of the best\nshots in the west. We follow\nthem through the beautiful\ncanyons of Utah and we feel\nthe tension mount, climaxing\nin their final jump to freedom off a100 foot high\nledge, to the river below. We\nsee them in New York and\nthen in Bolivia and we wonder if they are going to go\nstraight.\nPoignancy\nIt sounds corny, but it certainly isn't. The whole action\nis carried out with great attention to detail. The last\nscene is extremely poignant\nand brings home the futility\nof it all and makes one think\nthat it was a pity they didn't take their chance when they\nhad it. The movie is summed\nup by Etta Place (Katherine\nRoss). \"I 'll come with you\nand do your sewing, I 'll cook\nfor you, but I think I 'll miss\nout on the scene where you\nget killed\".\nDialogue\nThe dialogue is both amusing and witty and the photography (Harold Wellman) is\nimaginative and attractive.\nIt's one of the few westerns\nin which I have ever felt that\nI could be living it. Etta provides some charming incidental detail and provides us\nwith a beautiful and stunning\nsequence near the beginning\nof the film, when we meet\nher for the first time discarding her clothes at gunpoint.\nEveryone seems to act well,\nbut special mention must go\nto Paul Newman and Robert\nRedford as the Sundance\nKid. They manage to complement each other and so\nform a great team under the\ndirection of George Roy Hill.\nChris Lewis\n\"Indeed they're not\", I cried, patriotism swelling my\nsails. \"Believe me, at Imperial College you'd meet\ndozens, scores, hundreds of\nreal individuals, authentic\neccentrics, genuine radicals\neven!

There are now\nopportunities in railway laboratories all over the country\nfor honours graduates with\na flair for original thinking,\nbasic research and for solving the technical problems\nconfronting the day to day\nrunning of the railways.\nPeople of all scientific\ndisciplines are needed. Mechanical, civil and electrical\nengineers, chemists, physicists and mathematicians.\nThere are centres at London,\nCrewe, Swindon, Glasgow\nand the largest of all \u2014 the\nRailway Technical Centre\nat Derby.\nRESEARCH\nA large proportion of research is directed towards\nefficient use of transport\nrelying on steel wheel running on steel rail. Two new\nand now highly developed\nareas of (government sup-ported) innovation are the\n'Advanced Passenger Train'\nand the 'Train Control Project'.\nThe advanced train project is being designed to utilise existing track, unlike the\nJapanese high speed service,\nwhich had special tracks and\nalignments built expressly\nfor this service. Obviously\nthe British Rail research is\na much more fascinating\npractical idea. The work\ncovers a large field of mechanical engineering with\nmajor research being carried\nout into vehicle dynamics\nboth in the laboratory and\nout on the track. A new laboratory at Derby will, when\ncompleted, contain a range\nof test rigs for experimental\nwork on the Advanced Passenger Train, and other ve-hi cles. The train control project\n. is concerned with developing computer aided control\nof train movements, including scheduling of trains\nthrough busy junctions at\npeak periods, even allowing\nfor traffic disturbances \u2014 a problem which can contain\nsome 1040 distinct sequences\nof train movements! Special\ntain borne computers have\nbeen developed to continuously calculate maximum\nsafe speeds, taking into account the relevant track and\nCHRISTIAN UNION SURVEY . . .\n. . . Results\nThe Christian Union recently held a survey to determine I.C. Students' religious views. A questionnaire\not twelve questions asking\nviews on Christianity, referring to the Bible, Jesus\nChrist etc. was used and a i random sample of almost\n3% of students was interviewed (i.e. in Common\nrooms, departments, places\nof residence). The results\nshow good correlation with\na similar but more restricted\nsurvey conducted five years\nago with a13% poll.\n54% of those questioned\nbelieve there is a god, 16%\nare agnostic and 30%\natheist. There was no correlation between belief and Sunday school attendance, but\nregularity of Church attendance and Bible reading is\naffected by, or affects, belief.\nIt is difficult to distinguish\ncause and effect, but the\nreaders attention is drawn to\nQ.7 on ambition. Peoples'\nfirst reactions indicate much\nabout their character, and it\nappears that a belief in God\ni.; linked with a real purpose\nand meaning to life, viz 36%\nof atheists have a trivial or\nno main ambition, as compared to 14% believers.\nPerhaps most interesting\nare inconsistencies in\npeoples' beliefs and actions.\nA prime example is that, of\nthose who believe in God\n55% attend Church occasionally or less and a similar\nnumber seldom or never read\nthe Bible. Yet most people\naccept that, although not in-d is pensi ble in themselves,\nthese are the places where\nGod does reveal Himself to\nmen. 'How one becomes a Christian' and thus what a Christian really is, brought\na great diversity of opinion.\nIt was one question few had\nconsidered deeply and some\nthought totally irrelevant. It\nis interesting that 82% of\npeople did not think that becoming a Christian had anything more to do with Jesus\nthan perhaps following his\nteaching. This is directly\nopposed to the Biblical view,\nwhere Jesus is central and\nthose who believe in Him are\ntransformed by Him. Paul\nsaid 'If anyone is in Christ,\nhe is a new creation'. On the\nother hand only 4% of students were unsure of the\nhis tori city of Jesus, and a majority showed a respect\nfor Him, although many obviously found Him a great\nenigma. Many of these regarded the Bible as a book\nwhich contains at least some\ntruth.\nAs might be expected in\na university, a large proportion of students are still considering their beliefs, although it is obviously impossible to quote exact figures from the survey. Many\nsaid that they required further thought before being\nable to answer questions con-f ident ly, which might well\nexplain some apparent inconsistencies in opinion.\nIn conclusion, although\nsome have thoroughly considered their standing, many\nhave not and many answers\nsimply reflect their up bring ing. We would be happy to\ndiscuss any issues this survey raises and we hope that\npeople will use College to\nthink realistically about their\nbasis of life.\ntrain characteristics. All this\ntype of work covers a wide\nrange, electrical engineering\nscience, communication and\ncontrol, mathematics, computing and ergonomics.\nENGINEERING\nEngineering research projects range from the study\nof fatigue in various materials to the testing of soils in\nthe laboratory under dynamic stress conditions. The\nfatigue laboratory at Derby\nis one of the best equipped\nin Europe, with facilities for\napplying loads of up to 200\ntons. There are also soil-mechanics, metallurgy, concrete and non-destructive\ntesting laboratories involving\ngraduate staff in all the disciplines already mentioned.\nIn electrical research, a nun.ber of new investigations\nare taking place. Gas-discharge research has led to\nthe development of a plasma\ntorch system for improving\nwheel-rail adhesion. Computer studies and track trials\nare under way to develop\ncheaper systems for overhead electrification. Studies\nin special instrumentation\ntechniques, commutation of\nd.c. machines and character-Some of the main results\nare shown in the chart. The\nanswers to each question\nwere categorised and the\npercentage in each of the\nfour groups is shown below.\nThe four groups are atheists\n(A), agnostics (Ag), believers\nwho think God is interested\nin them (B), and those who\ndon't( NB). This last group\nis only 8 per cent of the\ntotal and thus not statistically certain in its an wer s, but they do reflect the inconsistencies in one group.\nNote: Main question \u2014 Do\nyou believe there is a god\"?\nNo \u2014 30 per cent; Not sure\n\u2014 16 per cent; Yes (and\nHe's interested) \u2014 46 per\ncent; Yes (but He's not\ninterested in me) \u2014 8 per\ncent.\nHow do you think a person\nbecomes a Christian?\na.

Billy is spastic\nin time, he has no control over which part of his life he is\nacting. The book follows these jumps, giving it a layered\nstructure in time, and thus the central theme, Dresden,\nbarely described as an episode, looms large.\nAfter the slaughter, one of the prisoners, a drafted highschool teacher, was shot for stealing a tea-pot. So it goes.\nThe shooting party consisted of only four people, because\nso few were left. So it goes.\nBilly Pilgrim's son was all screwed up at school.

G.R.C. and Academic Policy\nThe Editor,\nFelix.\nDear Sir,\nMay I express my thanks, through your columns, for the\nopportunity to speak on I.C.R.C. during the meeting held\nThursday afternoon, 5th March, in the Great Hall, with the\nRector present.\nThere was one question put from the floor by Mr. Hains,\nand it may also worry other students . . . namely would\nI.C.R.C. discuss Academic Policy matters. The answer to\nthis is\u2014if the matter was of general college interest, then\nICRC would be within its terms of reference to discuss it\nin a free and frank way, since by definition the matter would\nbe of interest to all.\nI personally cannot think of any such matters. All I can\nvisualise is that the effects of an academic policy could be\nbrought to I.C.R.C. Let me give an hypothetical case to\nindicate my point . . . Suppose it became 'academic policy'\nto introduce two shift working for lectures and laboratories,\nsay from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., and from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m., so that two degree courses were running simultaneously. This\nwould almost certainly be referred to I.C.R.C. to find out\nwhat everybody thought about it!\nNo\u2014I.C.R.C. will concern itself with matters of general\ncollege interest, such as financing of universities, college\nrefectories, college democracy and college structure, provision of college technical services and so on.\nAlready from its present short existence some good has\nemerged, since it has generated a wave of understanding\nand support for I.C. students throughout large numbers of\nnon-academic staff.\nYours sincerely,\nH.

However, the\nBoSt, also decides on examination results, repetition of\nexams and the terms and conditions of academic employ-ment, and on these Lord Penney is adamant that students\nshould have no voice. He\nalso sees no sense in the\nnotion of the Imperial College Representative Council (I.C.R.C.) \u2014 being pushed by both Council and\nthe Association of Scientific.\nTechnical and Managerial\nStaffs (A.S.T.M.

He feels the I.C.R.C. would be unrepresentative,\nonly pul t ting forward proposals decided by a majority\nvote, which disenfranchises\nthose who disagree with the\nvote.\nAll in all, Lord Penney\n'gave the impression rfa keen interest in student\naspirations and was \u2022d ways willing to consider out ideas.\nHowever, he objects to being\npress uri sed and maybe fee k that some of Upper Council's \"ultimatums\" are trying to\ndo just this.\nPinched\nPumps\nLarceny has struck in the\nI.C. bars again.

The end of the spring term means election time, and all the candidates for Union high office come out in their finery to exhibit themselves for public\napproval; to persuade you they are the people to turn the Union into a progressive, respected organisation which will best serve the interests of the students whom they re pre sent.\nThe candidates represent the left, medium left and centre; take your pick and cast your\nvote, I don't care where. But remember, whichever part of the political spec tum( or degree\nof fascism in its current use) they represent or are said to represent, their primary function\nis to represent yourselves. The students union decides policy at Union meetings, which\nshould not be used merely to rubber stamp decisions made by a small group of people\nat a previous occasion. The Union this year has been livelier and stronger than it has been\nfor a long time, but it has been run by too many people seemingly incapable of understanding any point of view which differs in the slightest from their own, and there are too\nmany Council members who represent not the Union floor, or their departments, but\nthemselves and their associates. You decide who will be on Council, you decide who will\nrepresent you there (if you care); so vote when the elections come round for the minor\nUnion posts as well as the exec, but don't be surprised next year if some of the successful\ncandidates seem as intent on pushing their own opinions regardless of everyone else as\nsome of this year's council have been.\nThis is the last FELIX of the term, and the last under my editorship. FELIX next\nterm will be run by Dave Chant and Ian Williams, who will need contributions from\nmembers of the Union to make FELIX as diverse as possible.\nI now resign as the alcoholic press-baron of East Durham and go back to trying to\npass exams. We still need staff to keep FELIX running smoothly next term, and to learn\nproduction and page lay-out in preparation for next term, so if you are at all interested,\nsome and see us in the press room.\nHalve the syllabus time\nDear Editor,\nI bought a copy of \" FELIX\" last week. First of all, let me congratulate you on the\naccuracy of your reporting. I looked very carefully at the three entries devoted to my\ncomments at the last U. G.M. and I could not find anything that I could really take\nexception to, altho ug th naturally I would have liked the emphasis to have been slightly\ndifferent on some matters.\nI had an interesting discussion with Brian Hains, the\nAcademic Liaison Officer of\nyour Union, last week, during which we tried to reconcile our attitudes. If I may\nmake the point, I think your\ngeneral endeavours to obtain\ndiversification with credit to\nbe given to such studies and\nrepresentation of the Board\n3f Studies are not the real\nissues that you should be\ntaking action (direct action,\nI think you call it) about.\nIn my view, you should be\nclam our ing for a reduction\nin your teaching load. The\nfact is that with the explosion of knowledge in science\nand technology, the syllabi\nin the Undergraduate Course\nhave become so overloaded\nthat students really have no\nspare time now to \"improve\"\nthemselves. By clam our ing for diversification with re-cognition, all you would do\nwould be to overload the already overloaded syllabus\nstill further, which I think\nwould be the straw which\nbreaks the camel's back, both\nfor the staff and the students.\nIn my opinion, what you\nwant and what you should\nbe taking direct action about\nis a lightening of the load on\nyour syllabi. If the syllabus\ntime and content could be\nhalved, you would then have\nadequate time to diversify\nand take all the many lectures on such subjects which\nare already available in the\nCollege, some of which could\nbe given credit for in your\nexamination.\nI hope you find these comments useful, and I shall be\nquite happy for you to publish this letter in \" FELIX\", and I know if you want to\nshorten it by editing, that I on you to give a version of my let-can rely\nbalanced\nter.\nYours sincerely,\nJ.

This is a direct\nresult of my method and approach.\nThe ICU Dept Reps have carried discussion into departments but a great deal more needs to be done. The staff-student committees in the department need strengthening and\nthe technicians involved in them to form mini ICRC's. The\nDept Reps should report results to department meetings. ICU Dept Reps should be on the BOST.\nEffective student power at a departmental level will speed\nup diversification\u2014specific ideas for courses must be produced before the end of the summer term ready for introduction\nand discussion in October. Union effort on diversification\nmust go up.\nUSK is now sufficiently strong to start inter-college diversification. The new USK committee and USK fund need\nstrengthening.\nUSK is now in a position to exert a clear voice in the London Region of NUS\u2014where the idea of co-operation between\ngroups of colleges can be further promoted.\nmust be adequately represented. It has been found at\nother colleges that when students gain membership of a board the power diffuses\ne les where. BoSt representation isn't sufficient to ensure\nconstructive participation.\nIt would seem wrong to assume that the admin are\nthere waiting to be approached diplomatically. Their diplomacy has consisted of\n\u2014meaningless consultation\n(Jurgo)\n\u2014not taking decisions\n(BoSt)\n\u2014unilateral declarations\n(AA merger)\nWe have had to struggle\nfor advances in democracy.\nDiversification\nIt is not just a matter of\nnegotiating on the basis of\npresent Union policy. There\nis no statement on the means\nof implementing diversification\u2014one must be formed by\nICU out of the departments,\nevolving from student ideas.\nThere is a danger of getting\nbogged down in discussions\non minor problems unless a comprehensive plan is formed by the students.\nShould there be a Liberal\nStudies department or should\ndiversification develop in\ndepartments by initially relating specialist courses to all\nrelevant fields. Postgraduates\nin\nRelate res ear cf be\nprogramme,\nto society?\nYou want to specialise? A strong flexible course-unit\nsystem would allow each\nstudent to make his own\nchoice of courses.\nUSK/NUS\nDo psychology at Bedford?\nThe course unit system was\nalso designed to allow intercollegiate courses within\nLondon University. Contact\nwith other colleges must be\nextended, (it's friendly).\nUSK could be made more\nvital by introducing joint\nlectures and courses.\nAnd what about having\njoint student houses?\nUSK women in Halls!\nContinuing to look outwards\u2014ICs membership of\nNUS will become more important as both Unions pro-gres s. Having been a delegate at NUS conferences I know how valuable the exchange of experiences with\nother colleges can be. IC\ncould use the background\ninfo, provided by NUS in\ncollege and department dis-cuss ions. During the coming year,\nthe ground that has been\ngained by the Union must be\nstrengthened and extended.\nICU must continue to move\nforward.\nArthur Lee, leader of Love, who appeared at IC last\nweek. See Felicity for report.\nICU has almost found its feet in NUS so next year NUS)\nissues can be increasingly brought directly to I.C. students.\nComing back to discussion and the corresponding control\nof your own life. The level of discussion and awareness in\nI.C. could be greatly increased by having a week of inter-year/department discussions of all sections of the college\nduring the first week of the October term\u2014I will try and arrange for this in the summer. In halls of residence the archaic\nand ignored rules should be discarded and the power of hall\ncommittees increased.\nUnion finances need re-appraisal. Next year the fight for an\nincreased Union fee must continue but the distribution of\nfinance needs changing (this will probably be done this June\nat Joint Council). More money must be allocated for Social\nClubs, Ad-Hoc Union activities (e.g. the Moritorium), sundry ideas, publicity, expenditure by ICU Dept Reps, and External Affairs. The means less money from elsewhere. The\nConstituent Colleges seem now to be finding their own new\nroles so will volunteer to cut their budgets.\nFinally, a president needs to be more than a 'nice-guy', or\na 'rep-on-council' and he has to do a lot more than have cosy\nprivate chats with the staff and the administration (if he understands the difference!). HE MUST BRING ISSUES INTO\nTHE OPEN.\n\n"

John McCullough, who organised the\nrace, was second in 57 hours,\n59 minutes, after spending\nSaturday night in the hospitality of Endinburgh police\ncells.\nThe main Carnival collection this term was held in\nHigh Street, Kensington last\nSaturday, with the backing\nof the Splinter group (cour-tes y of Jazz Club). This collection was totally legal, and\nthe brave few, who ventured\nout in the Arctic conditions,\ncollected a good \u00a380.\nThe last event of the term,\nstaged for your delight, will\nbe a James Bond film on\nMarch 19th, replacing the\nlate lamented Carnival Concert No. 2, which was unfortunately sat upon by a rather\nlarge showbiz enterprise.\nOur final plea is for strong\nand willing legs\u2014preferably\nwith bodies attached\u2014for the\nnext hitch-hiking com pet i tion, to be held on March\n13th.

It is his aim to\nmake the office more outward looking, and to encourage closer links with the\nouside world.\nTony Kirkham, a third\nyear physicist, is well known\naround I.C. for his long association with FELIX. He has\nheld practically every post\non the newspaper, and this\nhas enabled him to fully\nappreciate the running of the\nUnion.\nTony feels most strongly\nthat the Deputy President's job is not a political one, although Tony has views on\nmost aspects of Union pol-icy. He feels capable of cooperating with any of the\npresidential candidates.\nAndy Ward (Civil 2) is a departmental rep. on I.C. and\nas such has gained valuable\nexperience essential for an\nofficer of the Union.\nHe believes that important\ndecisions are not made by on\nthe spot judgement but only\nafter rational dic cus sion with\nwell informed people. The\nDeputy President must be\nable to discuss important\nUnion business with staff,\nadministration, other stud-ents, or his President.

However, with John\nBallard kicking out of defence very well, I.C. managed\nto contain them during these\nfew anxious moments.\nThe play was reasonably\neven until a few minutes before half-time. From the base\nof the scrum, Terry Stephenson moved to the blind side,\ngiving John Ballard time to\npass to Keith Devaney. From\na quick passing movement\nChris Wilson then scored an\nexcellent try.\nAt half-time I.C. were\nleading by three points to nil.\nAfter a few minutes in the\nsecond half, John Wild, from\nfull back, kicked ahead and\ncollected the ball. The loose\nplay that resulted led to John\nKelly charging down a Woolwich clearance to score\na well-timed try. In the sixth\nminute of the half, Clive\nSwinnerton added another\nthree points from a penalty\nfor a line out infringement.\nAfter a quarter of an hour,\nWoolwich mounted an exciting attack, but l.

But after five\nmore minutes I.C. attacked\nagain, with Kip Conolly kicking forward to coU ect the ball\nand score the third try. John\nWild, playing very well at\nfull back, was constantly\nkicking ahead to cause\ntrouble for Woolwich. In the\nlast minute of the game, John\nBallard gave John Kelly an\ninside pass to take him to\nthe Woolwich line, George\nWidelski, following up quick-ly, forced himself over for\nLC's. fourth try.\nWith these last three points\nof the match, I.C. sealed the\nvictory of a very good Cup\nFinal.

Perhaps Julie Driscoll, who was\noriginally booked instead of\nAlan Price, might have\ndrawn more people: the fact\nis that Guilds Ents. incurred\nquite a substantial loss\nthrough no fault of their\nown, for the organisation and\npublicity and entertainment\nwere all first class.\nThe loss is even more discouraging when compared\nwith the amount of effort\nwhich went into the event,\nSurely this (and incidentally\nthe loss th aRCS Carnival\nmade), suggests that the\nthree colleges pool their resources next year to provide\na unique evening's entertainment of this kind.\nR.C.S.

J. C.D.S& G Club in\nSnowdonia\nRescue\nIC Scout and Guide Club\ntook part in a dramatic\nmountain rescue in Snowdonia last weekend. Eighteen\nclub members went off on\none of their regular mountain walking trips on Friday\nnight. On Saturday morning\nthey set off in small parties\nto attempt the range of\nclimbs, though high winds\nand low clouds made the\ngoing very bad.\nIt was in the afternoon\nthat the drama occurred. One\nof the IC groups was stopped in the Llanberis Pass and\nasked to help in the rescue\nof two men badly injured\nnear the summit of Snowdon.\nThey helped in the remarkably difficult task of manhandling two stretchers up\nthe mountain. Whilst doing\nthis they discovered the bodies of two more victims, an\natomic s engineer and his\nwife. The IC party came\ndown at nightfall and returned to the hut where they\nwere staying. Another party\nwas rapidly formed to help\nin the rescue. This was not\nneeded, so everyone consoled themselves with a few\nin the pub across the road.\nEditorial\nThe end of the second term coincides with the end of the season for many athletic\nclubs and is the time when clubs weigh up their success and failure. The 'Links' Trophy is\nawarded at the end of each year for the club which has achieved the best results bearing\nin mind the competition encountered. Strong contenders this year must be I.C. W.S.C.( who won it last year). They have won the hockey cup and also come high in the\nbadminton league. The rugby club, are of course, playing in the final of the Gutteridge Cup (see back page) and have had one of their finest seasons for some years. The\nmen's badminton have gone through the season unbeaten and easily top their league.\nI often think that it is a pity that the success of a club is often measured on the success\nof the first team. This year, for example, the association football club 1st XI were\nknocked out of the cup and are likely to finish second in the league. Lower down, how-ever, the 2nd XI are in with a chance of both their respective league and cup titles and\nthe 6th XI play in a semi-final replay. This strength in depth is characteristic of many\nI.C. clubs and reflects the strong sporting tradition of the College.\nJOHN DARLEY Rowing:\nI.C. win Head\nAn I.C.

In a hard fought\nmatch, Guilds put up a fine\nperformance to come out\nwinners by two goals to nil.\nFrom the start R.C.S. put\nGuilds under pressure but\nthe Guilds defence always\nlooked sound with S. Boyce\nplaying well at centre half,\nand once the Guilds forwards came more into the\ngame Guilds began to look\nthe more dangerous side.\nR.C.S. could have taken an\nearly lead with some fine\nwork by J. Kelly, but it was\nleft to Jeff Keer, causing a lot of trouble in the R.C.S. defence, to score with an opportunist shot which was misjudged by the goalkeeper.\nThe second half opened\nwith some determined attacking by R.C.S. which\nkept the Guilds defence busy\nbut with Keer and Willey\nlooking dangerous, Guilds\nlooked more likely to score.\nThe goal came from a good\nrun down the line by Peter\nWilley, who centred and the\nball ran dangerously across\nthe area for Mike Knowles\nto run into and shoot a fine\ngoal, sealing the match.\nGuilds continued to pressure\nTech. Cup\nR.C.S.0 the R.C.S. defence and ran\nout sound winners. The\nGuilds team, containing eight\nfirst years, must be a good\nprospect for future years.\nTeams:\nGuilds\u2014K. Hewitt, P. Maslin, R.

Boat Club is well on\nits way back to the position\nof premier college in U.L. By beating Middlesex Hospital, last year's winners, and\nthe U.L. \"Tyrian\" crew, the\nI. C.1st VIII won this year'sU.L. Head of the River\nRace, held over the Boat\nRace course, thus regaining\nthe \"Dixon Bowl\".\nCreditable performances\nwere made by the other six\nI.C. entries, and the Novice\ncrew stroked by Hayden\nEvans was unlucky to lose\nits division by 4 seconds over\nthe 20 minute course. It is\nhoped that by the summer\nI.C. will have complete dominance in all U.L. divisions.\nEarlier this season the 1st VIII came 3rd in the Peterborough Head, out of an\nentry of 33 club crews. Since\nthen all the VIIIs have progressed in their preparations\nfor the Head Races at Kingston and Putney, where there\nwill be strong I.C. entries.\nU.S.A \u2014 VACATION JOBS\n(Up to \u00a350 per week).
