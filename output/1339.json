Never\nfear, the rugby coach was only too\nhappy to let the belle of the RSM\nhockey club have a seat on their\ncoach, as you might imagine. After\na surprisingly quiet ride with the\nopposition, we set about watching\nthe IC 1sts match before us while\nIC 4ths hit their warm-up routine.\nAt one point they were all doing\ncommunal stretches in a circle and\nwe thought for a minute they might\nburst into song. We were, however,\nspared. After plenty of pre-match\nbanter with their captain on the\nsidelines, we took to the pitch facing\never-increasing bad light with the\nfloodlights out of action.\nThe IC 4ths started at a blistering\npace and had the run around of a\nparticularly lethargic RSM defence\nfor the first 10 mins. However, after\na few last ditch tackles from Mikey\nand plenty of \u2018organising\u2019 (shout-ing abuse) from the goalkeeper\nSam, the situation stabilised and\nthe miners began to play. Pikey, our\ndefender, was by this point injured\nas tradition now dictates and played\nan entire match in agony, hence the\nspecial mention. The midfield was\na battlefield\u2019s worth of carnage in\nwhat would turn out to be a very\nscrappy and gritty game. Tim, Alice\nNick and Mikey never really being\nable to find the space they needed to\nplay properly in midfield, resorted\nto a war of attrition. Neither team\nmanaged to take an upper hand\nin the first half but IC had clearly\nspotted our danger man, Charles\nP having to deal with two or three\nmarkers at any one time.\nAt half time the score was 0-0 and\nthere was no certainty of victory.\nIn fact, the IC 4ths had matched us\nin every department and given us\na good scare in the opening min-utes. After introducing the midfielders to the backs at half time, they\nstarted (finally) to work together\nand the second half was slightly less\nscrappy. The 4ths were still matching us all over the pitch but when\nour chances came we took them.\nCharles Thornton being the first to\nopen the RSM account with a very\ntidy goal. After that, the miners saw\noff a very reasonable attempt by the\n4ths to score and Nick decided to\nput another one away for safety. By\nthis point our opposition were still\nfighting tooth and nail but Charles P\nmanaged to slot another goal away\nand give us a rather flattering score\nline.\nThis was certainly not a case of\nbeautiful hockey but we showed we\ncould scrap it out with the best of\nthem and get three points on the\nboard. And Alice floored her mark-er, much to his surprise. The post\nmatch celebrations were every bit\nas messy as the game itself; we wish\nCharles P a swift recovery. Quote of\nthe day/champagne moment goes\nto an anonymous IC 4ths player for\nreplying to Nick\u2019s post-match handshake with that well known sportsmanlike adage: \u2018f*ck you\u2019. Thanks\nIC 4ths for a tough game and well\ndone to RSM.\nRegular readers of Felix\u2019s outstand-ingSportsectionwilldoubtlessrecall\nthat back in October, IC\u2019s favourite\npirate-themed football team handed the dirty, cheating medics a 7-1\nspanking. With the memory of the\nHarlington massacre still weighing\nheavy on the minds of both teams,\nthe Mighty Mighty Sevens had several questions that needed answer-ing: Could the medics really play\nas badly again? Would they have a\nkit? Were they going to give up on\nfootball mid-way through the first\nhalf and start another kick-boxing\ntournament? Only time would tell.\nThe air was tinged with anticipation as the battle-lines were drawn.\nSam deliberately lost the coin-toss\nand the medics fell into his trap\nof changing ends, an early mental\nvictory for the Sevens. The game\nbegan with the kick-off, in the traditional fashion. Early medics pressure suggested that IC may have a\ntougher challenge on their hands\nthis time round, although the Sevens\nalmost pinched a goal on the counter attack after Sam chipped the\nball over the medics\u2019 centre-back\nand lobbed the keeper, only to see\nthe ball fly inches wide. Eventually,\nthe IC defence took the sting out of\nthe medics attack, and the Sevens\nbegan to get a foothold in the game.\nThe first goal came when Sam\u2019s\ncorner was headed in at the back\npost by a suspiciously unmarked\nSzczczczczesiak for his first IC goal.\nUnconfirmed reports indicating that\nhe may have been hiding behind the\ngoal prior to the corner being taken\nremain unconfirmed at the time of\ngoing to press.\nSam made it 2-0 to IC with a\nscreamer (see diagram), a curling first-time strike from 25 yards\ninto the bottom corner. That was\nthe way the score stayed until half-time. The Sevens finally clicked\ninto top gear after the restart and\nthrew everything they had at the\nmedics. Debutant Matias scored\nthe third after skinning his marker\nand placing the ball into the far\ncorner, and the Sevens fourth goal\ncame after another piece of comedy\nmedic defending when the centre\nback chested Pete\u2019s cross into his\nown goal, 4-0 IC.\nMens Football\nImperial College 7th XI 4\nICSM 4th XI 2\nSam Styles\nCarry on ICSM 4ths\nWell, we\u2019ve been somewhat quiet\nrecently, but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re still\nrucking, mauling, drinking and creating our usual brand of chaos! As\nfor a quick summary of the term\nso far:\nWe picked up record numbers\nof freshers at the start of term\nand headed off for our first match\nagainst GKT. We have quite a history against GKT and this year was\nno exception (we even pinched one\nof their best players, she defected to\nIC this year!). We came through vic-torious, 12-5 with virgin tried from\nTumbles and newbie The Flash. St\nMary\u2019s were second and a slightly\ndifferent story. A bedraggled virgin squad (and two rather plucky\nlacrosse girls that we managed to\nsnaffle) battled hard but lost 55-0.\nThe third match saw us run out 27-10 winners against Wye and again\ngave us virgin tries, this time from\nCherry P and GKT.\nSo, onto the matter in hand:\nRoehampton. This was a home\nmatch and we arrived at the pitch\n(or should I say sand pit) and wondered if Roehampton had brought\nany backs. Faced with an opposition\ncomposed almost entirely of props,\nsome of our slimmer players looked\na bit worried!\nWe kicked off and found that\nappearances hadn\u2019t been deceiving and Roehampton weren\u2019t the\nfastest opposition we\u2019d ever come\nup against! What they were good\nat, however, was mauling, committing a sheer force of bodyweight\nthat the virgins couldn\u2019t match.\nSo despite spending a lot of time\nin the Roehampton half, we spent\nmost of it in futile mauls going\nnowhere and knackering the for-wards! It was then that the main\nfeature of the game started happening \u2013 scrums. And more scrums.\nOh, and some more scrums. I\u2019m\nnot sure if we had a scrum that\nworked first time throughout the\nwhole match! The virgins have a\nWe\u2019re still here, just less\nvocal than last year!\nAt 4-0 up and with everything going\nswimmingly, the Seven\u2019s pirate ship\nsuddenly sprang a leak. A long ball\n(surprise, surprise) from the medics keeper was uncharacteristically\nmissed by the otherwise outstanding Seven\u2019s defence, and cheating\nex-IC player John Scott scored with\na neat, if somewhat Judas-esque\nfinish. Another almost identical goal\nfollowed shortly after and the pirate\nship had entered uncharted, stormy\nwaters. With captain Sam setting\na fine example by losing his head\nwhile all around him were also losing theirs, IC began to panic and a\nnervous 20 minutes ensued. A couple of let-offs and near-misses later,\nhowever, the storm subsided and\nIC\u2019s pirate ship emerged battered\nbut unbowed with a 4-2 victory.\nA cut-out-and-keep guide: How to splaff on medics \u00e0 la Sam\n7th XI end 2005 on a comical note fairly experienced scrum and can\nhold their own against most teams,\nbut Roehampton had some, shall we\nsay, interesting scrum techniques!\nTwisting, collapsing, wonky, injuries,\nbadly fed balls, balls coming straight\nout, you name it \u2013 it went wrong!\nStill, when the scrums did eventually lead to play, Spandex made\nsome awesome steals to put us back\non the attack. Then our advantage\nreally came into play. We may have\nbeen down a player compared to\nRoehampton, but our backs ran\nrings around them! Storming runs\nfrom pretty much all of them gained\nus valuable ground. The Flash managed to skip round three of them to\nscore our opener. We hadn\u2019t learnt\nthough and were still taking it into\nmauls, then either losing ground\nor the ref deciding nothing would\ncome of it. Roehampton fought back\nafter going down in the scoring and\ncrashed over the line just before\nhalf-time to even the score.\nAfter a team talk, we went into the\nsecond half with a different tactic\nand saw almost immediate results.\nIt seemed Roehampton were not\nfamiliar with the concept of rucking\n(kind of just standing there and looking at us) and going to ground four\ntimes in succession took us almost\nto their try line. After the usual\n5 scrums, the ball was spun out\nto the backs where a blinding run\nfrom GKT nearly gave us our second\ntry, but unfortunately the pass to\nTumbles on the line was forwards\nand we were denied. GKT shortly\nafterwards went off down the pitch\nagain (towards the bar, apparently\nshe could smell the beer!) and this\ntime got through to make it 10-5. We\ncontinued to ruck and pushed our\nadvantage. The Flash was held up\non the line, but we came back again\nand Tumbles sprinted round several\nplayers to extend our lead. We spent\nmost of the rest of the game resetting scrums again and despite some\ngood kicking from Roehampton,\nmanaged to avoid our half entirely.\nForward of the match went to our\nnew girl Ali (so new she doesn\u2019t have\na bar name yet!) who gave cracking\nsupport throughout. Back went to\nGKT for general fabulousness. A\nspecial mention should also go to\nMonkey, continuing the virgin tradition of kicking props!\nRSM in derby day victory\nImperial College Lodge\nInterested in Freemasonry?\nContact: felix-ad@iclodge.org\n\n"

    "content": "Nightlife nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRabbit, rabbit\nWell, the first term has gone and\nwhat a hoot that was. A few bits of\ninformation first: nightlife will be\nrunning every other week now, as\nI am being a bit wanky and have\ndecided that evenings before exams\nshould be spent revising and not\ngoing and getting minging. Don\u2019t\nquite know what the picture is\nabout, but it seemed like a good\nidea at the time, along with biking\naround London. It is very easy to\nforget your bike helmet by the way,\nit\u2019s only when you realise your head\nis colder than usual that you notice\nit\u2019s missing.\nSince last issue, we had the holiday period, and all I can say is: God\nbless Valium. I don\u2019t think I could\nhave got through my time at home.\nThe big thing was New Year\u2019s Eve,\nthe focus of this weeks nonsensical\nramblings.\nWell, we have white rabbits, the\nmad hatter and a giant toadstool,\nAlice in Wonderland theme if you\nhadn\u2019t already guessed. I kid not; it\nwas a very interesting evening. The\nreview is my New Year\u2019s Eve at\nPushca. More details in the review,\nbut first I have to make a few comments about the general public\u2019s\nbehaviour. At the time it seemed\nlike a good idea to get public transport to King\u2019s Cross dressed as\nthe white rabbit. I think it was the\neffect of a bottle of champagne and\nthe fumes from the spray hair dye.\nThat stuff is very potent, I don\u2019t recommend using it in a warm room\n\u2013 you get a little bizarre to say the\nleast.\nOh yes, the public. Not only did\nwe get heckled and shouted at,\nsome random guy on the tube started taking pictures of us. I wouldn\u2019t\nhave minded, but he didn\u2019t even ask\nand was trying to be sneaky about\nit. I suppose we did ask for it when\nI had white hair and white skin. Oh,\nand the ears as well. I had to keep\nthose on, otherwise I just looked a\nbig randomer.\nI hope everyone had a good time\nduring the festivities and hasn\u2019t\nturned to prescription medication\nat the thought of coming back to\nImperial. If you have, I can recommend a few, just drop an e-mail and\nI will send you a list.\n10\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 12 January 2006\nI can\u2019t imagine those gloves stayed white all evening\n\u201cWhite rabbits, mad\nhatters and a giant\ntoadstool\u201d\nPushca:\nMaking plans for Alice\nNew Year\u2019s Eve comes every year\nand sometimes it\u2019s good, sometimes\nit\u2019s a bit rubbish. This year I was\ndetermined to have a good time.\nHaving never spent it in London, I\nwasn\u2019t sure what to do. I had heard\nof Pushca through some randomer\ncovered in bodypaint. The thing with\nPushca is, it is essential to dress\nup and get into the theme. This\ntime it was a dark take on Alice in\nWonderland.\nHaving spent a long time deliberating about what to go as, I opted\nfor the White Rabbit and my friend\nTrish decided on the Mad Hatter.\nWhen you buy your tickets, they are\nvery adamant that you have to get\ninto the theme. If you do not they\nwill turn you away at the door, which\nwould prove a very expensive and\nrubbish night. I apologise for my\nlack of vocabulary, I think I killed\na few brain cells over the holiday\nperiod.\nNow, the evening started with\npainting my whole upper body\nwhite and trying to drink a bottle of\nchampagne. The really sad thing is\nthat you couldn\u2019t tell the difference\nbetween the make up and my skin\nin some parts. I am that pale. I\u2019ll tell\nyou something else I didn\u2019t know:\nthat corsets are a lot harder to do\nup than I thought; feet were put into\nuse as well.\nWhere did she hide that balloon?\nThe location of every Pushca\nevent is kept a secret until the last\nminute, we didn\u2019t find out until the\nnight. Once ready, we then travelled\nby public transport to King\u2019s Cross.\nThis was the one place where we\ndidn\u2019t receive much heckling at all, I\nsuppose they\u2019re used to all the hook-ers, so a pair of Alice in Wonderland\ncharacters doesn\u2019t even register\nwith them. Trying to find the venue\nwas a bit of a nightmare, it was\nround the back of Russel Square in\nMary Ward House.\nI\u2019m glad she was wearing pants\n\u201cGreeted by a\ncaterpillar on a giant\ntoadstool\u201d\nWhen we entered the venue, we\nwere greeted by a caterpillar on a\ngiant toadstool. She was a very nice\nlady, she gave me a little kiss on\nthe cheek. The entrance hall was\nabsolutely rammed. The coat check\nwas stupidly in a tiny corridor. So,\nof course, when everyone arrived\nit was just a huge jam of people in\nvarious forms of undress, and that\nwas just the start.\nInstead of buying drinks, we had\nto buy tokens from different characters near the bars. For New Year\u2019s\nEve, the drink prices weren\u2019t too\nobscene, but they weren\u2019t cheap by\nany means, but when your bar staff\nare as hot as they were, you don\u2019t\nmind paying a little bit more. A rule\nfor future nights out, attractive bar\nstaff = high drink prices.\nShe ended up getting tied up\nCome over all Donni Darko\nAttractive bar staff\n= high drink prices\nThere were several rooms playing a huge range of music. I haven\u2019t\nbeen to a party where there was\nsuch a huge range. Each room was\ndifferent but each DJ in each room\nplayed completely different sets.\nEach room also had a different\ntheme; from a garden wonderland\nto a tea party.\nWhat was nice to see was that all\nthe crowd had made such an effort,\nthere wasn\u2019t one person who had just\nturned up with no effort. Some had\ntried slightly harder than the others,\nto be fair. This one gentleman came\ndressed as the Cheshire cat, I had\nto keep running out of the room as\nsoon as he entered as he looked so\ndisturbing. It was like those evil cats\nyou see in horror films.\nOne of the best costumes, I have\nto say, was the woman in full 16th\ncentury garb including big wig. How\nshe danced, I do not know, she must\nhave been sweating her tits off. She\nwas going for it though. In fact,\nthere wasn\u2019t a single person who\nwasn\u2019t enjoying every minute of\nthe evening. The amount of people\nI just found myself talking to was\nunbelievable, and everyone was so\nfriendly. I guess this may have had\nsomething to do with the amount of\nchemicals in their systems but still,\nthey were all great.\nShe was such a lovely lady\nWhere is my pint for that shelf?\n\u201cShe should get a\ndoctor to take a look\nat that\u201d\nAt 11.30pm the most bizarre stage\nshow started. It involved a naked\nwoman covered in gold glitter and\na woman with a rabbit head grinding metal on her crotch. It looked\nlike one of the craziest STI\u2019s I\u2019ve\never seen. She should get a doctor\nto take a look at that. The gold lady\nwas a whole different ball game,\nshe proceeded to finger herself on\nstage, bend over, pull a gold balloon\nout of her arse, matching darling,\nand blow it up. She then popped it\nover the crowd covering the first few\nrows with glitter. Nice.\nAnyhow, that was my evening, I\nhope you enjoyed it.\nAaron Mason\nShe came with attachments\n\n"

The\nless frequently used items, including\nsome periodicals held jointly with\nImperial, will move to a newly created library repository at the Science\nMuseum\u2019s site in Wroughton, near\nSwindon, Wiltshire. The materials\nstored there will be made available\nto users in the Central Library within 24 hours using a \u201cmodern document delivery system\u201d.\nImperial College plans to redevelop a large part of the existing library\nbuilding to provide upgraded student study facilities with improved\naccess to digital library materials.\nThere will also be a separate room\nwithin the Science Museum where\nresearchers can consult specialist Science Museum archives and\nlibrary material. The three locations\nwill be electronically connected to\nensure efficient management.\nImplementation of the proposal\nbegins this month and is likely to\ntake around two years to complete.\nThe process will include refurbishment of the library at Imperial,\nincreasing study space for students\nand using digital and wireless technology to improve the learning\nenvironment.

You may want\nanother new start,\nbut regrets are so last\nyear! Don\u2019t waste your precious\ntime, there\u2019s so much for you to\nenjoy.\nAw, bless...\nDear Miss C,\nTwo weeks ago I gave my\nboyfriend a blowjob and swallowed\nfor the first time. Recently, my\nstomach has been feeling a bit\nstrange and I have still not had my\nperiod. My boyfriend says there is\nnothing to worry about but I just\nhave to know - could I be pregnant?\nMs Take\nDear Ms Take,\nOk! Let me clear this up for you\nonce and for all! Having spoken to\nmy medical student friends, I can\nconfirm you cannot, let me repeat,\ncannot get pregnant from oral sex!\nWhether you\u2019re pregnant from\nanother night or a split condom\nor something, I dunno, but you\nare definitely not pregnant from\nswallowing! Now, it\u2019s possible\nthat your stomach is feeling funny\nbecause you\u2019re allergic to semen\nand are hence feeling a bit sick.\nDoubtful, but if that\u2019s the case, then\njust spit next time - it\u2019s acceptable.\nNow, if you\u2019re still feeling the need\nfor reassurance that you\u2019re not\npregnant, go to the nearest Boots\nor visit a doctor or the NHS walk-in\ncentre and get a pregnancy test,\nbut please, for your own sake, stop\ntelling people it\u2019s because you\nswallowed. People will laugh, in\na cute bless-her kind of way, but\nlaugh they will...\nThere goes another one...\nDear Miss C,\nI lost my virginity not long ago\nbut ever since my first time, every\ntime I use a condom, it splits. I\nhave tried using x-tra strong but\nit has made no difference. What\ncould be causing this to happen?\nMy friends say I have a funny\nshaped knob. Could this be true?\nNeed Reassurance\nDear Needs Reassurance,\nOk, before this goes any further,\nI need to stress I am a girl, and\nobviously have no experience in\nthis area, but I will try my best.\nNow, as I have never seen your\npackage, I can\u2019t really comment on\nyou having a weird shaped knob.\nYou can send me a picture if you\nwant, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m dying to\nhave a look, although it may provide\namusement for the Felix office.\nNow, as to your query, I don\u2019t think\nyou having a weird shaped knob\nis the problem, unless of course\nit\u2019s the shape of a Christmas tree,\nin which case - get yourself down\nto the nearest urologist and see\nif they can fix you before you do\nsome serious damage to one of\nyour partners. Why your mates\nfelt the need to look and analyse\ndoes scare me slightly. Don\u2019t give\nme any of that shit about having to\nlook in the locker rooms, you really\ndon\u2019t. Girls manage without, why\ncan\u2019t you? My associates and I have\ndiscussed your problem in detail in\norder to find a possible explanation\nand we suggest that you try a larger\nsized, higher quality condom, or\nsearch for alternative methods\nof contraception, i.e. warn your\npartner, as, if they are female, you\nmay end up with more than you\nbargained for.\nWhere did all the balls go?\nDear Miss C,\nA few nights ago I shagged a girl on\nthe pool table in my halls. I noticed\nthat there is a CCTV camera in\nthere and I was wondering if you\nthought it would be acceptable to\nask if I could get the recording?\nYa Ma!!!\nDear Ya Ma!!!,\nMate, do you have a death wish?\nSending me that question when\nthere really is only one conceivable\nanswer? Well, this is good for\nme, it lets me start off this new\nyear with a fully deserved rant\nabout the world of men! No, it is\nnot acceptable for you to ask for\nthat film and it\u2019s obvious why,\nalthough for someone with some\ninsane exhibitionist streak, I\u2019m\nsurprised you even took the time\nto ask. Before I totally lose the\nplot of this question though, I have\na few questions for you. Why the\npool table? In the centre of the\ncommon room? Are beds no longer\ncomfortable enough? I\u2019m sure the\nsofa would have been a bit easier\non her back! How on earth did you\nget the girl to agree to that one?\nMethinks someone slipped a bit of\nRohypnol into the eggnog! Now,\nback to your initial question. I\nreally don\u2019t approve of you asking\nfor the tape. But boys will be boys\nand will want to gloat, and I\u2019m sure\nthat tape will win you awe from the\nother boys, but I doubt the security\nmen will return it to you. Now, as\nmuch as I\u2019d like to hope that the\ntape has been erased, I live in the\nreal world, and it has probably been\nput in the CCTV tapes Cupboard Of\nFame, and might possibly be on the\nway to some candid camera show\nsuch as idiotic drunken students,\nor being posted on a porno site as\nwe speak. I hope you\u2019re ready for\nsome publicity. Sheer decency says\nyou warn the girl, and mate, in the\nfuture, 3 words \u2013 get a room!\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHappy new year! Hope you\nenjoyed your Christmas break,\nbut just in case you didn\u2019t enjoy\nthe family festive fun, remember\nI\u2019m here to answer all your\nworries at agony.felix@ic.ac.uk.\nI came back slightly disturbed\nto find these 3 X-rated presents\nin my inbox. Methinks some of\nus defiantly enjoyed the festive\nseason and felt the need to share,\nor, in some cases, gloat!

Diane\nArbus Revelations contains nearly\ntwo hundred of her most important\nand iconic photographs, and is the\nbiggest retrospective of her work\never presented and has raised many\nquestions about the ethics of her\nphotography.\nArbus\u2019 work is very unsettling to\nview and at time even disturbing.\nObsessed with the idea of cataloguing the people of New York, she\napproached every social taboo\nunashamed and apparently unconcerned as to the effects of her pho-tographs.\nHer photos, though in ordinary\nsettings and of ordinary subjects,\nare stark, cold and harsh on the eye.\nArbus somehow manages to make a\nnormal scene seem sinister. From\na young boy proudly displaying a\n\u2018Bomb Hanoi\u2019 badge to a peeping-Tom style photo of naked women\nsunbathing, each photo gives off the\nfeeling of something being wrong,\nalthough it is not always easy to\npinpoint why.\nHer subjects are varied and inter-esting. The most interesting are of\nthe normal people she captured out\non the streets of New York.\nThese people are ordinary and\nunimportant, but Arbus picks up\non the tiny details that make them\nRevelations, public and private\narts arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDiane Arbus causes controversy at the V&A\nPhotography\nDiane Arbus: Revelations\nV&A\nUntil 15 January 2006\nTickets \u00a36 Students\n\u201cWho killed the chicken guy?\u201d is\na truly contemporary and experimental play written by one angry\nWelshman, two angry black men\nand a black feminist. These are four\nof the ordinary writers from the\nOval House Theatre, and with director Karena Johnson, have presented\nan incredibly intricate comedy.\nThe play is an ironic blend of pas-sion, anger, tears and, above all\nlaughter. A humorous and mad brew\nof death, politics, confused sexuality\nand disdained love, fermenting in\nthe oppressive setting of a locked\napartment. The result is explosive\nin every single sense of the word.\nThe play reflects London\u2019s current\ncultural variety, scratches the sur-face, digs deeper, and tells us how\nthe past can come back to kick you\nup the arse.\nThe action spins around the 15th\nfloor of a flat in South London where\na \u201cbent\u201d politician, an ambitious\njournalist, a hopeless dad, and a\nreally disturbed bag lady find themselves trapped. This provides the\nright environment for the plot to\ndevelop, and the real nature of the\nprotagonists to come out of the clos-et, and find out unimaginable things\nabout each other.\nThe structural design of the\nOval House Theatre provides an\nexceptionally close and cosy setting for the audience to get completely engulfed into the action. The\nemotional connections between the\ncharacters start as crazy separate\nstories. However, they start connecting together and making sense\nas the plot evolves, with a big twist\nat the end.\nThe deranged bag lady is one of\nthe neighbours in the building. She\nspeaks an utterly crazy African language and chants around the flat\nRafiki-style.\nThe play takes place in the journalist\u2019s new flat, when her dad, a\nwomaniser electrician, comes to\ninstall the electrical appliances. At\nthe same time, her work colleague,\nwho is actually her lover, is finding\nmajor issues about the compatibility\nof his political career and his relationship with the journalist.\nFather-daughter issues, an ambitious political career against relationship issues, sexual confusion,\nall full of guilt and puzzlement, get\nstirred revealing a very dark story\nbehind it all, making you cackle\nthroughout the entire play.\nAnd in the end, who kills the chicken guy? The play is much more\ncomplex than that; it talks about so\nmany different things. The question\nbecomes much deeper.\nDaniela de Angel\nTheatre\nWho Killed the Chicken Guy?\nThe Oval House Theatre\nKennington\nwww.ovalhouse.com\n\u201cYou Machiavellic\nmetro-sexual\nmotherf***er!!\u201d\nWho killed the Chicken Guy?

She gives them\nin their fullness and asks us to view\nand judge what we see.\nApply for a grant, Arbus said of\nher aims, \u201cI want to photograph\nthe considerable ceremonies of our\npresent, because we tend, while living here and now, to perceive only\nwhat is random and barren and\nformless about it...\n\u201cThese are our symptoms and our\nmonuments. I want simply to save\nthem, for what is ceremonious and\ncurious and commonplace will be\nlegendary.\u201d\nThese photographs tell as much\nabout Arbus herself as they do about\nthe subjects. Walking around the\nexhibition, you get the feeling that\nshe was a very self-obsessed artist.\nsearch of \u2018freaks\u2019 of society to pho-tograph. Starting innocently enough\nwith oddities such as female impersonators and fat naked women, she\nprogresses onto more controversial\nsubjects, as in The backwards man\nin his hotel room, 1961.\nThe image is distressing, not only\nbecause of its freak-show qualities,\nand because it is such an intrusion of privacy, but also because of\nher patronising attitude. She photographs the man haggard and tired,\nfacing away from the camera. In\ndoing so she is asking us to feel his\nshame, and take pity on him.\nNot stopping there, Arbus continued this trend by photographing\na group of people with mental dis-abilities. Her Untitled series cap-The one self-portrait in the collec-tion, Self-portrait pregnant shows\nher attempt to scrutinise herself in\nthe same way, but instead results in\na soft and dream-like photograph.\nIndeed, Arbus\u2019 obsession leads\nher to disregard all propriety in\ntures these people in such a grotesque way, that it is hard to look at\nthem for a sustained period of time.\nAlthough the scenes are apparently\nof enjoyment, Arbus manages to put\non such an air of blunt monstrosity\nthat you cannot but help feel her\nsubjects are unwilling victims of a\npitiless mind.\nHowever, it is certainly clear that\nArbus shaped our attitudes towards\nphotography drastically.\nIn her unrelenting attempt to\nrecord the fringes of American soci-ety, she has created a time warp; a\nflawless but delicately cruel collection of images that at once inspire\nand haunt the mind.\nEL\n\u201cA photograph is a\nsecret about a secret.\nThe more it tells you,\nthe less you know.\u201d\n\u201cThese are singular\npeople who appear\nlike metaphors somewhere further out\nthan we do...\u201d\nDiane Arbus, 1961\n15\nfelix\nThursday 12 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "W\nhy is Michael Barrymore allowed to do\nHitler impressions in the Big Brother\n(sorry \u2018Celebrity\u2019 Big brother house)\nwhen recently a hospital driver got\nsacked for doing them at his office christmas\nparty and then in the hospital while at work?\nCan someone please explain that to me? Hitler\nimpressions are not the cleverest thing to do in\nthis day of age of political correctness so I was\nnot entirely surprised when Stephan Marsham\ngot fired from the Princess Alexandra hospital\nin Essex. I did not think it was right; but I was\nnot suprised. However, then Mr Barrymore does\nthem for the whole of the UK to see and there\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be any call for him to be chucked\nout. Now, I am not sure how good Mr Marsham\u2019s\nimpressions were - Michael\u2019s were not very good\n(his Frank Spencer impression, on the other\nhand, was excellent) - so maybe that is where the\ndifference lies. Maybe it is fine to do impressions\nas long as they are not particularly good, and\nmaybe no one but me realised it was meant to be\nAdolf, though I feel that is unlikely!\nIt is kind of fitting that two of the most\nridiculous things in England should overlap;\npolitical correctness and Big Brother. Political\ncorrrectness has gone far too far. Schools have\nhad to cancel sports days because children are\nnot allowed to win and lose anymore, because it\nmakes the losers feel bad! That\u2019s brilliant, they\nwon\u2019t now lose when they are young, they won\u2019t\nget used to disappointment and failure. Instead\nof simply growing up knowing they weren\u2019t\nthe fastest in the school they will grow up as\ncomplete and utter losers unable to impress in\nuniversity or job interviews. We learn more from\nlosing than from winning.\nAlso it is now pretty much wrong to make any\nkind of joke; can\u2019t joke about fat people, can\u2019t\njoke about foreigners (except perhaps the Irish),\ncan\u2019t joke about the opposite sex! The only safe\nsubjects are blondes and gingers and I bet they\nare preparing a movement to stop us picking\non them! Just like losing, being picked on\nmakes us stronger. I\u2019m not saying kids should\nbe bullied and physically beaten but everyone\ngets picked on! Also jokes are an essential part\nof our culture, it is one way we bond with each\nother and discover who has the same view on\nlife as we do. If you don\u2019t like the way someone\nacts, don\u2019t hang around with them! If someone\ndeliberately tells jokes to someone who they\nknow finds them offensive then that is a\ndifferent matter but people should be allowed to\nhave a joke with a group of like minded people.\nAs for \u2018Celebrity\u2019 Big Brother it is probably\nonly slight less ridiculous than rampaging\npolitical correctness. The word celebrity in itself\nis quite funny. Between Big Brother and \u201cI\u2019m a\ncelebrity get me out of here!\u201d they must have\nused up nearly every Z list celebrity there is.\nI am longing for the day that Craig, winner of\nBB 1, walks back into celebrity Big Brother and\nis hailed as a famous TV personality! Though\nmaybe they are missing a trick there, how about\na \u201cBB Winners\u2019 BB\u201d? Take all the winners from\nthe first 6 series and put them in the house,\nthen the nation really would have to choose\nbetween its favourites! And also chuck in Nasty\nNick just for fun because he deserved to win it!\nFor all of you who didn\u2019t watch BB 1 then Nasty\nNick was a very bad man who spent six weeks\ndiscussing nominations with other housemates\nand was never nominated once himself! The\nconfrontation between himself and the other\nhousemates was gripping TV and did wonders\nfor Craig\u2019s (who eventually won) popularity\nrating as he was seen as the leader of the other\nhousemates during the stormy meeting.\nBy now you will have all realised that I watch\nBB so I probably have no right to slag it off.\nIn my defence I only watch it sometimes due\nto there being very little else on TV, and I am\nnot an obsessive viewer. Also, I remember the\noriginal BB when it was nice and simple; ten\nhousemates, one house, a lack of food and a task\neach week. Now there are so many extra bits\nthat it just gets confusing and Celebrity BB is\njust as silly, after all when is someone actually\ngoing to get evicted? Aren\u2019t they only in there\na week? Mind you some of them will probably\nwant to stay in there longer because I don\u2019t\nsee them having a very good life outside; Mr\nGalloway\u2019s constituents are asking what the\nhell he is doing in there and the police probably\nwant to interview Barrymore again now he has\nadmited live on TV that he was high on dope the\nnight someone drowned ion his swimming pool\n(and he did Hitler impressions!)\nPersonally I hope that Chatelle wins; she\nisn\u2019t particularly clever, she isn\u2019t very good at\nsinging, she isn\u2019t a lot of things but most of all\nshe isn\u2019t some desperate, haggard old celebrity\ndesperate for one last moment in the limelight.\nL\natest reports of Ariel Sharon indicate\nthat he is being weaned off sedatives\nto bring him out of an induced coma.\nHowever, even if successfully revived,\nthis incident marks the end of his political life.\nHe has long been a leading figure in Middle\nEastern politics, with a legacy most recently\nbeing associated with the pullout from Gaza and\nthe formation of the \u201ccentrist\u201d political party\nKadima. This paints a picture of a man who is\nprepared to take risks in the interest of peace.\nYet, if we scratch beneath the surface and recall\nhis past actions, this political demise actually\nmarks the end of an era of repression and terror.\nWith regards to the formation of Kadima,\nSharon left the \u201cright-wing\u201d Likud party in order\nto do so \u2013 another party he helped establish.\nThe reason he gave for this drastic step was infighting amongst Likud members caused by the\nGaza pullout and their refusal to co-operate with\nthe peace process. A more pressing and morose\nreason, though, was to counter the rising popularity of the leftist Labour party under the leadership of Moroccan born Amir Peretz, a much\nmore vocal supporter of peace and of a welfare-driven state in opposition to the war-mongering\nand neo-liberalism Sharon espoused.\nBy setting up Kadima, Sharon successfully\nappeared more left wing and so reduced the\ncompetition from Labour. However Kadima\u2019s\nranks were full of recognised rightist figures,\nessentially making it a new Likud, with the same\nagenda but without the emotional baggage!\nRegarding the commendable issue of the Gaza\npullout, it has been suggested that the main reason for this was the ratio of indigenous Arabs to\nJews, which was too high and so was against the\nracist nature of the Jewish-only state of Israel.\nAs the expected congratulations from world\nleaders flew in, unknown to the majority, the\n19 square miles of Gaza given up were rapidly\nreplaced by occupation of a further 23 square\nmiles of West Bank within the next month with\nenlargements of other strategic settlements.\nSo what does Sharon\u2019s end as Prime Minister\nmean for the world as a whole? By leaving\nboth Likud and Kadima stranded, Sharon has\nleft them unelectable chickens without heads,\nleaving Amir Peretz as his successor. But even\nif Peretz is successfully elected in around 80\ndays time, it will be a step in the right direction\nat most and will not lead to any fair deals for\nthe Palestinians, e.g. the right of Palestinians\nto return from refugee camps to their seized\nhomes and homelands that they were forced out\nof: a right which Peretz opposes.\nUltimately, the stability of the region may\nchange in the short term but for long term peace,\nthe international community urgently needs to\nget its act together and use this window of opportunity to change the status quo, resolving the\nillegal settlement building and denial of even the\nmost basic rights to the Palestinians. Until these\nrights, homes and the livelihoods of Palestinians\nare not permanently restored to them, and the\ninternational community and superpowers do not\ntake an unbiased view to Palestinian suffering,\nthere will be neither peace nor an end to terror-ism, whether it be Palestinian or Israeli.\nT\noday the Brown Couch can reveal the\nreal reason for the Sports Centre opening\ndelay. Two builders and 3 College Police\nwere killed over New Year in an epic gun\nbattle which ripped apart the Sports Centre inte-rior. Extensive reworking is now required before\nit can be opened on 30 January 2006.\nNews of the failure was broken to college in\nan email on 6 January. \u201cA series of unforeseen\nminor setbacks\u201d were cited as the main cause\nfor the delayed opening. In papers recently\nreleased under the College Free Information\nBill, the Brown Couch has been able to piece\ntogether the events leading up to the term.\nOne paper, entitled \u201cEthos Executions\u201d,\ndetails the events of 1 January 2005. Two build-ers, referred to only as \u201cGriff\u201d and \u201cTerry\u201d had\ndrunkenly decided to start work on the demolition of Southside at a party they attended for\nNew Years Eve. At 4am, Griff and Terry started\ntheir mechanised cranes and began demolishing\nwhat they thought was Southside. At 4.30am, a\nroutine security patrolman discovered Griff and\nTerry at work knocking down key sections of\nthe Ethos Sports Centre. The patrolman alerted\nsecurity staff whose response was brutal.\n12 security guards, 5 attack dogs and 10\narmed College Police attended the scene at\n4.45am. Verbal warnings were given to Griff and\nTerry who were still unaware of their situation.\nAccording to the Head of College Police, \u201cAfter\nthe warnings, the offenders still seemed in a\nstate of blissful ignorance. Two warning shots\nseemed to sober them up though. They jumped\nfrom their bulldozers and sprinted inside the\nSports Centre.\u201d\nA team of 8 elite College Police were sent in\npursuit while a call was placed to the Mayor of\nCollege for authorisation to kill. The Mayor was\nat a New Years Eve party when the call came\nthrough. When the situation was explained, he is\nsaid to have screamed \u201cKILL!\u201d. Once that order\nwas issued, Griff and Terry lasted only another\n20 minutes, before being executed poolside.\nIt is now that the details become a little hazy.\nWe shall now make use of the damage report to\ngive you a fuller picture of what happened inside.\nThe damage list, as compiled on 2nd January,\nstated the facts as \u201cblood everywhere\u201d, \u201cshattered tiles in swimming pool and changing area\u201d,\n\u201crifle storeroom raided\u201d, \u201cred pool water\u201d and\n\u201ccafe coffee cup slightly cracked\u201d.\nOur sources have confirmed the following\ncourse of events. Griff and Terry ran inside\nthe Sports Centre, desperate men. They broke\ninto the rifle storeroom and armed themselves\nfor what was to be their last stand. There then\nfollowed mild skirmishes that shot their way\nthrough the building until Griff and Terry were\ncornered in the changing room showers. They\nhad managed to kill 3 of the 8 \u201celite\u201d College\nPolice who then decided to change tactics. Griff\nand Terry were flushed into the open using IC\nfire grenades. They dived into the pool to put\nour their burning bodies, where they were then\nminced by machine gun fire.\nFor College to suggest that all this is \u201cminor\u201d\nonly highlights the terrible massacres that must\noccur with all other \u201cmajor building projects\u201d.\nKilled\u2019a Builder?\nAmmar Waraich\nBrown Couch\nIain Heaton\n18\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 12 January 2006\nSharon and his recent pursuit of peace\nPC and BB\n\n"

T: 020 7594 8060 www.union.imperial.ac.uk\nUnion\nCentral Library\nThis year will see the start of redevelopment of the Central Library, South Ken campus. The redevelopment aims to provide more study space - modern and with\nimproved digital and wireless technology - as well as improving working conditions, such as the much needed air conditioning. It\u2019s likely to take around 2 to 3\nyears to complete, with the first phase starting in July, soon after term finishes.\nScience Museum Collection\nOne of the ways of achieving more space will be through the relocation of infrequently used items from the Science Museum collection. These are currently\nkept in stores in the Central Library and will be moving to Science Museum premises in Wroughton, Wiltshire. The items will be available via a 24hr call-back\nservice (accessed online, by phone or through the Library), so that anyone wanting to access these items can do so. Discussions with the Science Museum\nabout the future of its Library have been ongoing over the past 2 years, resulting in this solution. The Science Museum Library\u2019s frequently used Science &\nTechnology Studies collection (STS) will remain at the Central Library.\nMore info can be found at http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/libraryfuture/info_faqs.asp . If you have any feedback, be sure to raise it on http://www.\nsciencemuseum.org.uk/libraryfuture/\nIt\u2019s expected that items will start to be moved from the Central library during the Easter Holidays. This is clearly a time of high library usage for exam revision, so\nto begin with only items in stores in the basement and ground floors will be removed using the back exit, to keep any disturbance to the minimum. Items from\nany of the reading rooms will not be moved until after summer term\u2019s ended.\nIf there are problems, let us know asap so that we can ensure College address them adequately.\nThis summer\nThis summer will see work on Levels 4 & 5\nLevel 5\nLevel 5 will be renovated and the Humanities department will move in (currently this floor is also taken up by offices). The Business Studies collection from Level\n5 will be relocated to Level 2, along with the study space.\nLevel 4\nWork here will focus on improving the study environment and in particular on tackling temperature and ventilation problems. Whilst the work is going on, some\nof the collections from this area may need to be relocated, such as those for Life Sciences and Medicine. At the moment the Library is assessing how much of\nthe 4th floor is actually going to be disturbed and what the relocation needs will be. However, all Level 4 stock will be back in it\u2019s location before the start of the\nnew term.\nAlternative Study Space during the Summer holidays\nCollege are looking at options to provide alternative study space elsewhere on campus, but as close as possible to the library, so that anyone still needing to\nwork can do so away from the worst of the building disruption. More information on this will be available in due course.\n24hr Library\nFrom the beginning of the Easter Holidays and throughout the Summer term, the Central Library will once again operate on a 24/7 basis.\nIf you have any comments and feedback on anything mentioned here, please let us know, so that we can work with College to\nminimise the disruption the renovations will cause students and ensure that the improvements do benefit the student body.\nSameena Misbahuddin\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nUnion Entertainments\nThis term the Union is simplfying the price structure for it\u2019s\nFriday night entertainments.

    "content": "sport\nEat Lard, Climb Hard\n24\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 12 January 2006\nIC climbers report from far a\ufb01eld\nQuick Crossword by Fishface\nCrossword\nsetters\nrequired!\nfelix@ic.ac.uk\nThe last time I remember an article\nabout ICMC in Felix was when a\nwheel fell off our minibus. Come to\nthink of it, the time before that was\nwhen we rolled another one. Since\nthen, Kev has left and the quality\nof Union minibuses has improved\ndramatically, so I\u2019d like to correct\nthis potentially negative impression\nof the club and persuade you that\ngetting out of London and climbing is the only way to spend your\nweekends.\nWhen I ask most people why they\ndon\u2019t climb, I get the answer that\nthey don\u2019t like heights. In fact, neither do many climbers. Although\nthe sport was originally the domain\nof Victorian gentlemen looking for\nexotic ways to die, it has evolved\nnow into many different disciplines.\nTraditionalists still seek adventure\nin long difficult routes, but many of\nus prefer to stick to leisurely sports\nclimbing. \u201cBoulderers\u201d, another\nbreed, concentrate on technique,\nbuilding up strength and skill on\nshort, intense, and well protected\n(safe) climbs.\nThere are plenty of opportunities\nto try these styles of climbing, and\nmore, on our fortnightly weekend\ntrips around the UK. Peak District\ngritstone and Dartmoor granite\nprovide technical short routes and\nbouldering, and anything from long\nrock routes to frozen waterfalls can\nbe found in Wales. However, my\nfavourite areas are the limestone\nsea cliffs on the coasts of Pembroke\nand Swanage. There is no feeling\nlike standing at the base of a rock\nface, belaying a climber with waves\nlapping at your feet as the tide slowly but surely advances towards your\nledge. There are plenty of less scary\nspots in England, but none are as\natmospheric and special as the sea\ncliffs.\nWith the variety and quality of rock\nonly a few hours drive from London,\nyou may ask why we ever go abroad.\nAs you can imagine, the weather is\nour enemy. Swanage may be glorious on warm sunny days, but warm\nsunny days are in short supply in\nEngland. Therefore, during the holi-days, we head off in search of drier\nclimes and warmer temperatures.\nLast year, club members climbed\nin the US, France, Thailand, Spain,\nCroatia and, most recently for our\nsummer tour, a very successful trip\nto Lake Garda in Italy, organised by\nour untiring president Herman.\nDuring the summer, Lake Garda\nitself is filled with people sailing,\nwaterskiing, windsurfing and doing\nevery other kind of watersport\nimaginable, but surrounding it are\na series of low altitude mountains.\nThese constitute the southern end\nof the Dolomites, the chain that runs\nnorth through Italy, becoming the\nAlps. You won\u2019t find any snow or ice\nat such a low altitude, so the area is\npacked with a variety of warm and\nspectacular rock routes.\nDespite my addiction to the local\npizzarias and gelaterias in Arco (the\ntown in which we were staying),\nthe highlight of the trip for me was\n\u201cPlacche Zibrate\u201d, a collection of\nroutes up an unbroken 500m slab of\nrock. This area is also popular with\nBASE jumpers, who throw themselves off an overhanging buttress\njust above the routes. Taking advantage of the thirsty outdoor folk is a\nsmall bar at the base of this crag.\nIt even had binoculars so we could\nenjoy a cold drink at dusk while\nwatching our fellow climbers\u2019 head\ntorches as their relaxed route turns\ninto a night-time epic.\nUnique to the Dolomites are \u201cVia\nFerrata\u201d, \u201cIron roads\u201d of guide-rails and ladders bolted to the rock\nthrough the mountains. They were\noriginally constructed so that the\nItalian army could move quickly\nthrough the Dolomites, but recently\nthey have been restored and extended for visiting walkers and climbers.\nWhilst never as hard as the normal\nclimbing, they give the opportunity to move fast and safely through\nstunning mountain scenery, with little effort.\nAnother high point was climbing\nby the lake itself, for many of us our\nfirst attempt at deep water soloing.\nThis involves climbing up the rock\nface to around 40 feet without a rope,\nand then jumping into the lake. It\u2019s\nthe most wonderful feeling \u2013 to be\nable to climb without a harness on\na hot day and then cool off in fresh\nwater. All in all this year\u2019s summer\ntrip was a fantastic success.\nUnfortunately, London isn\u2019t surrounded by sunbathed mountains,\nbut it does contain some of Europe\u2019s\nbiggest and best climbing walls.\nThese may not be the same as real\nrock, but you can build up strength,\nstamina and technique in safety and\ncomfort during the week. We also\nuse climbing centres to teach fresh-ers the basics of climbing, before\nthey go on the weekend trips. We\nhave new people joining us throughout the year, many of whom have\nnever even seen a rope before. So\nif you are interested at all in climb-ing, want something to take your\nmind off work, or are looking for\nsomething more exciting than jogging around Hyde Park, then come\nalong and join us. We meet in Beit\nQuad, by the Union entrance, at\n1pm every Wednesday. All you need\nto bring are comfortable clothes to\nclimb in, so come and get involved!\nFor more information email markus.\nroggen@imperial.ac.uk, or go to our\nwebsite www.union.ic.ac.uk/moun-taineering.\nMountaineering\nMatt Wallace\nDon\u2019t look down!

    "content": "Flights of Fancy\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMy two pence: If you need to read\nsomething feel-good, you could do\na lot worse \u2013 the world is an interesting idea and it is original. Any\nMartin fan should avoid this as\nit is nowhere near as good as his\nlater works.\nAs I wander back into the sea\nof unremitting unpredictability and\nconfusion that is Imperial College,\nI can\u2019t help but wonder where it\nwas that I had last felt this way.\nWas it some drunk encounter left\nover from my scholarly days at IC\nor some other drunk encounter\nduring my days of convalescence\n(from too much drinking). No, dear\nreaders, this sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, elusive yet persistent, has a far more\npoignant origin. Fans of the Fantasy\nstyle is a mere shadow here and\nhis characterisation and depth is\nnon-existent, meaning also that he\nfails to make the reader care for\nhis characters as he can in other\nbooks. Not for lack of trying, I might\nhasten to add, as it\u2019s quite obvious\nthat Martin is attempting tricks to\nput across all these feelings \u2013 but to\nsomeone who\u2019s more accustomed\nto the polished style and poise of his\nlater books, he fails miserably.\n\u201cIf I had never heard\nof Martin before, I\nmight have enjoyed\nthis novel...\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing specifically poor\nor even sub-par about Martin\u2019s\nnovel \u2013 the idea is very original,\nthe plot is water tight, the writing\nis intelligent and the whole story\nplays together perfectly. So why am\nWindhaven\nby George R R Martin and Lisa\nTuttle\nRetesh Bajaj\ngenre amongst you will recognise\nthe name George R R Martin as one\nof its heavyweights, and the majority\nof you will be familiar with his hard-hitting, explosive writing in A Song\nof Ice and Fire. This novel, then,\npenned by the same author, can\nbe assumed to be the same mix of\nstory, action and pace that has made\nMartin such a huge success \u2013 or so\none may be forgiven for thinking.\nThis stand-alone novel shows us\nMartin flexing his creative muscle\nfor the first time as he ventures into\nthe realms of storytelling earlier on\nin his career. The simple story of\na girl with a dream to rise above\nher station dictated by society is\nweaved into an epic battle of wills\nin a fictional world. Ultimately, a\nfeel-good story in a Fantasy wrap-per, this novel is quite blatantly a\nstab at writing from someone who\nis inexperienced and still feeling his\nway forward. Fans of Martin\u2019s other\nworks will be dismayed to discover\nthat the hard and fast pace of his\nbooks\nI condemning it? Let me just put it\nthis way \u2013 to someone who\u2019s tried\nPralines and Cream, Vanilla will\nnever be good enough. I have seen\nMartin at his best and to witness\nthis piece of work next to them simply makes it pale in comparison.\nWhich brings me to my final point\n\u2013 if I had never heard of Martin\nbefore this novel came to me, I\nmight well have enjoyed it. So I\u2019m\nperfectly happy to recommend this\nto anyone who\u2019s never heard of\nMartin before. And, if you happen\nto be a fan, take this book out only\nif you wish to see Martin practising\nfor the future, as there\u2019s very little\nelse here for you.\nAs this novel stands, it is far from\nperfect, and yet Martin\u2019s skill, talent and, above all, imagination are\nevident even early on in his career.\nAnd, stacked alongside other standalone novels by rival authors, this\nwork still stands head and shoulders above the rest.\nand would therefore stay at home\nand revise. Yes, Miss Delaney has\nbeen living in tracksuit bottoms for\nthe first two weeks of the Christmas\nholidays. However, in the last week\nthis changed when I emerged from\nmy room to buy a few birthday\npresents for friends. After nearly\n5 hours, I bought enough to clothe\na small island (some items I don\u2019t\nthink even the local charity shop\nwould want) but failed to buy any\npresents. Alas, I may have to go back\ninto town and go shopping again. At\nleast I get some exercise.\nBeauty for men has always been\na taboo subject. Well, just in the\ncompany of straight men that is. But\nare men\u2019s moisturisers any different\nto women\u2019s? Although I frequently\nborrow my boyfriend\u2019s cream (it\u2019s\nNivea for Men, nothing gay about it\nI\u2019m told) I always wonder if my face\nwill be covered in thick facial hair\nthe next morning.\n\u201cMale hormones have a pro-Dolly Delaney\nFashion Editor\nAs I write this article, I have just consumed three packets of mince pies.\nConsequently, I\u2019m feeling decidedly\nfat and disgusting. My mother has\na bad habit of buying in threes;\nnow as there are three members in\nmy household, a complete parental\nunit and myself, it seems logical\nthat three packets of mince pies are\nadequate. However, my father is a\nDiabetic and my mother doesn\u2019t like\nsweet foods.\nQuestion, \u201cWho\u2019s Most Likely to\nTurn into a Whale?\u201d. Answers on a\npostcard please.\nSo with Britain\u2019s waistlines ever\nincreasing due to MPs, I ask myself:\nwhat is there to do to make one feel\nslightly better about oneself. Sale\nShopping of course!\nI purposely brought home only a\nfew nice clothes, in the hope that\nthis would mean I couldn\u2019t go out\nMPs turn fashion editor into whale\n\u201cDelaney has been\nliving in tracksuit\nbottoms for two\nweeks\u201d\nfashion fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGeorge R R Martin\u2019s early e\ufb00orts in Windhaven show just how far a writer can go\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nnounced effect on the skin,\u201d says\nClinique dermatologist Dr David\nOrentreich. \u201cThey make it stronger\nby improving or enlarging the middle layer of the skin, the dermis,\nwith collagen. Also, the epidermis\ntends to be thicker. Men\u2019s skin is\noilier though, because male hormones turn on oil glands.\u201d But\naremen\u2019s moisturisers any different to women\u2019s? \u201cThe basic concept of cleansing, exfoliating and\nmoisturising twice a day is just as\nimportant for men. In fact most men\nwill find that their shaving routing\nimproves when they start cleansing\nand exfoliating regularly.\u201d So that\u2019s\na no then.\nHere\u2019s something that I thought\nwould amuse you while sitting in\nlectures. No it\u2019s nothing to do with\nfashion.\nThe following was asked on a\nUniversity of Washington chemistry\nmid-term:\nBonus question: Is Hell exothermic or endothermic?\nAnswer: First, we need to know\nhow the mass of Hell is changing in\ntime. So we need to know the rate\nthat souls are moving in and the rate\nthey are leaving. I think that we can\nsafely assume that once a soul gets\nto Hell, it will not leave.\nSome of the religions in the world\ntoday state, that if you are not a\nmember, you will go to Hell. Since\nthere are more than one of these\nand since people do not belong to\nmore than one religion, we can\nproject that all souls will go to Hell.\nWith the current birth and death\nrates, we can expect the number to\nincrease exponentially.\nBoyle\u2019s law states that in order\nfor the temperature and pressure\nin Hell to stay the same, the volume\nof Hell has to expand as souls are\nadded. This gives two possibilities:\n1 If Hell is expanding at a slower\nrate than the rate at which souls\nenter Hell, then the temperature\nand pressure in Hell will increase\nuntil all Hell breaks loose.\n2 Of course, if Hell is expanding\nat a rate faster than the increase of\nsouls in Hell, then the temperature\nand pressure will drop until Hell\nfreezes over.\nSo which is it? If we accept the\npostulate given to me by one Ms\nTeresa Banyan during my freshman\nyear that \u201c...it will be a cold day in\nHell before I sleep with you\u201d, and\ntake into the fact that I still have\nnot succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then #2 cannot be\ntrue, and thus I am sure that Hell is\nexothermic and will not freeze.\nThe student received the only A\ngiven.\nThink you\u2019re\nfabulous?\nDo you think you\u2019re fashionable?\nSend me a picture with your\nname and department. If I agree,\nthen your picture could be in the\nnext issue of Felix!\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSales, magic creams and the eternal question\n9\nfelix\nThursday 12 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "\ufb01lm film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nMission Impossible 3 What\u2019s\nwith the sequels, you say? Two\nwords, Tom Cruise. Special\nagent Ethan Hunt is back, with\nperhaps a very Photoshop-edited\nface or just a thick set of makeup.\nBecause, from the trailers, he was\npretty much wrinkle-free! Gasp.\nDon\u2019t you just want to know what\nanti-wrinkle cream he uses?\nAnyway, back to the story. Mission\nImpossible 3 is pretty much the only\naction film series that can garner\nas much attention as James Bond.\nWho\u2019s the babe this season you say?\nIt\u2019s the lovable Keri Russell, who\nrose to fame with TV series Felicity.\nAnd apart from the babe, what reasons do we have for watching the\nshow? Firstly, it\u2019s been 5 years since\nMission Impossible 2. Hence, imagine the amount of technology that\nhas been developed in this number\nof years.\nThe second reason is, of course,\nthe lead actor, Tom Cruise. He might\nbe getting on in years but he definitely knows how to stick around.\nWhat with the \u2018You complete me\u2019 in\nJerry Macguire and the helicopter\nmoment in Mission Impossible 2,\nany movie with him in it has got to\nbe cool and worth a watch. The third\nreason is definitely the fact that\nwe\u2019ve been facing a serious lack of\nedgy and cool action thrillers. (Yes,\nwe have.) It\u2019s coming out in May, so\ndon\u2019t miss it!\nS\ntart the year right by\nmaking the right choices.\nHere\u2019s a list of films Film\nFelix pretty much can\u2019t\nwait to see (or have seen\nand think are fabulous):\n1\nMemoirs of a Geisha Okay,\npardon my scepticism, but\nI usually refrain from recommending adaptations. It\u2019s usually a\nletdown. But \u2018Memoirs of a Geisha\u2019\nis definitely the exception that disproves the rule. In this edgy film,\nZhang Zi Yi assumes the lead role\nas Sayuri, the geisha in the making.\nTo help her along is Mameha, played\nby Michelle Yeoh. Mameha herself is\none of the most sought-after geisha\nwith a heart.\nUnlike her, Hatsumomo, the most\nbeautiful geisha in the district,\n(Gong Li) is determined to destroy\nSayuri. With a stellar cast consisting of the three beauties of the east\nand a handsome lead actor, Ken\nWatanabe, could this movie even be\na flop? Into the Blue was a letdown\nand it had the abs of Paul Walker\nand the Coke-bottle figure of Jessica\nAlba. Hence, this movie could still\nbe a flop.\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t. In fact, it\nwas beautiful and poetic. Never had\na movie used beauty to such efficiency to express the more intricate\nof human emotions i.e. desperation,\njealousy, insanity, jadedness, resilience and falling in love. It\u2019s released\ntomorrow, guys! Don\u2019t miss it!\n2\nIce Age 2 Remember the poor\nancient squirrel, Scrat? He\u2019s\nback and he\u2019s just as resilient\nas ever to get his nut! For some\nreason, I pretty much refused to\nwatch Ice Age when it came out.\nBut I was shocked to discover that\na story of prehistoric animals trying\nto return a human baby to its parent\nwas actually entertaining. I know, I\nknow. And ever since then, I\u2019ve been\nin love with Sid and his extreme lack\nof brain cells, which seems to work\nout for him somehow.\nSurprise, surprise! Because Ice\nAge is back with a sequel entitled\nIce Age 2: The Meltdown. Okay, I\nhave to agree, the title lacks a wee\nbit of imagination. But then again,\nwhat an animation requires to succeed is a really cute but dumb character like Sid, a few humanized but\ncomedic animals such as Manny the\nMammoth (voiced by the hilarious\nRay Romano) and a family-friendly\nscript.\nOkay, maybe not, but then again,\nlet\u2019s stick to the story. In this sequel,\nthe Ice Age is coming to an end,\nand, you\u2019ve guessed it, (no prizes for\nguessing) \u2013 the glaciers are all going\nto melt and flood every other animal\nto kingdom come. Sounds dull? I\ndon\u2019t think so. Because not only do\nthey have to save the world with\ntheir hilarious antics, Manny starts\nto date as well. And it\u2019s a girl mam-moth, voiced by the lively and vivacious Queen Latifah no less. Hence,\nIce Age 2 is the animation to watch\nout for this year. Kick ass, Sid!\nI know I am\nLooking forward to the New Year?\n4\nThe Da Vinci Code Yes, it\u2019s\nthe movie that everyone who\nhas read the book has been\nwaiting for. And yes, they could definitely have used a smoulderingly-sexy man for the lead, such as Paul\nWalker. But no, they are using the\nmost talented man in showbiz, Tom\nHanks, instead.\nLike I\u2019ve said, I never like to recommend adaptations. But this isn\u2019t\njust any adaptation. Why? Seriously,\nif you do ask this question, you are\neither a) surrounded by people who\ndon\u2019t read or b) you imbecile, why\nhaven\u2019t you read the bloody book?\nTo cut the long story short, it\u2019s controversial because it challenges the\ntraditional opinion of Jesus Christ.\nGet this, Jesus Christ has a wife. Is\nthat possible?\nAs with every movie and every\nstory, I advise a little caution. Keep\nin mind that theories are really\nnothing but theories. Then again,\nI\u2019ll leave you space to form your\nown opinion. Why watch it, you say?\nApart from the sensational sto-ryline, there\u2019s the talent of Tom\nHanks and the many beautiful views\nof Rome and the Vatican City to look\nout for. In a nutshell, it is definitely\npopcorn-worthy.\nSay what? Only four films to look\nout for, no way! Of course not, more\nto look out for in the next issue of\nFelix. Until next week, people!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nCherry blossoms, a geisha and a unifying bridge of harmony. Sometimes cliches can be beautiful too.\nIce Age returns with the faithful Diego, the dependable Manny and air-head Sid!\n6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 12 January 2006\n\n"

After some educa-tion, some bullshit, some training\nand a bit more bullshit, the cadets\nwere sent to a shuttle simulator.\nDespite correct suspicions and near\nrevelations, the mission was a suc-cess.\nChannel 4 pitched the show per-fectly; building suspense with\nevery episode. So much effort was\nploughed into it and the stooges were\nhilarious. Russian crew commander\nYevgeny, a.k.a. Alex Humes should\nbe given the Best Actor Oscar\nnext month; one classic line: \u201cIf\ny o u\nmeet space slug,\nit will mate with you, you w i l l\nmake beautiful babies.\u201d Moral issues\nwere called into question though.\nWas the hoax too unkind on the \u201ccosmonauts\u201d? Blasting into space is an\nadventure few experience. The illusion was meticulously and convincingly constructed. I felt part of the\ngang, in on the joke; then the cadets\n\u201csaw\u201d Earth and I felt very guilty\nindeed. Channel 4 argued they still\nfelt the thrill of seeing Earth, even if\nit was false. I\u2019d agree to some extent\nbut the feeling of humiliation and\ndisappointment would probably rule.\n\u00a325k on the other hand \u2013 fair enough\nto me! However, Space Cadets was\nthe next step towards more extreme\nreality TV; caution needs to be taken\notherwise execution, not eviction,\nwill be voted for. Blimey, 400 words\ngone, just like that. Excellent show\nthough.\nChristmas came and went,\nmaking way for 2006. New series\nBalderdash and Piffle began\nlast week. The BBC asks viewers\nto find out the earliest origins of\nphrases and words. Some blonde\nwoman also goes around investigat-ing, correcting the stubborn dictionary writers that their \u201cploughman\u2019s\nlunch\u201d definition is ten years out\nof date. Trust me though; it\nwas more interesting than I\ndo it justice!\nInvasion started on Sunday;\nanother American, mega-budget, 20-million episode\nlong series. It was pretty good.\nComing across as a less serious\nX-Files, a show I loved; it should\nfill the sci-fi void created when\nLost finishes. Thankfully, Invasion\ndoesn\u2019t trudge along stuck in the\nsand like Lost and the excitement\nis continued through the episodes!\nHuff. Huff! Save it for next week\nTomo.\nFinally, Celebrity Big Brother\nbegan last week. Another wonderful show set to consume the 9 to 10\nslot. The lowdown: Jodie is a moron\ntrying to prove she is not a slapper,\nunsuccessfully. She just confirms\nmedia speculation. Pete Burns: \u201cI\ndon\u2019t try to look like a woman, I just\nhave no choice.\u201d Whatever, moron.\nGalloway is likeable by me. Rodman\nequals womaniser. Maggot to win!\nOh no!

It was crap\nthe\nweek before so I\nomitted it, but it was so awful last\nweek I must write about it.\nHurley was under the\nmicro-scope. A microscope constructed\non Jupiter or something, but that\u2019s\nbeside the point. It turns out Hurley\nwon the\nlottery back in America\nand has since been jinxed. Back\non the island, he is eager to find\nthe \u201cFrench chick\u201d. Hurley sheds a\nfew tons in the process as he walks\nwith intent to find her. He locates\nher but, oh. Suddenly she\u2019s a nice,\nunderstanding woman who pours\nher heart out to him. No savagery or\ntorture, she just tells how the winning lottery numbers were the reason her ship ended up on the island\nand why her whole crew died. Great,\nso there goes any excitement of finding anyone else on the island? The\nforeign transmission was due to her\ntoo, no surprise there. But that\u2019s my\nbeef; the episode was so uninspiring,\n\ufffd\ufffd\nA s a pupil, you\nhave preconceptions that teachers are blank, with little\nor no personality; they\ndon\u2019t have lives outside\nof their sorry, underpaid exist-ence. Teachers are almost robotic\nmachines that operate Monday to\nFriday, 8 till 6. They only know how to\nshout and strike their red ball-points\nin a crossing motion, or stroke in an\n\u201cF\u201d motion if they\u2019re the US model.\nOnce the end of school bell has rung\nthey return from bus duty, in single\nfile of course, to their corner of the\nstaff room and mark books. After\nsticking down the very occasional\ngolden star, they walk on the left\nhand side of the corridors to their\nstore-cupboard and power down for\nthe night.\nGoing out, smoking and drinking\naretreatsreservedfortherarelunch\ndown the\nlocal on teacher training days, but not for the teachers\nof Summerdown Comprehensive.

Ewan is likeable,\nhandsome and gullible; Ben is a\nneurotic RE teacher but \u201cnot a fucking Christian\u201d and Damian is a sarcastic loser. This bunch of booze\nguzzling twenty-somethings are far\nfrom the Demon Headmaster. They\nwalk through corridors swearing\nlike troopers, whilst in the\nbackground little Bobby, little Freddy\nand tiny Timmy are all getting the\nshit kicked out of them. School is literally a riot for these kids. Children\nfight with medieval swords and\nanother set of pupils even fire off a\nmilitary mortar! But, if there was\na school award\nfor most childish\nmember, the teachers would win it\nevery time here.\nAt Summerdown, the bell is cer-tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nis it worth watching the rest. Finally,\nsomething was revealed but it was\nlike expecting Family Guy DVD for\nChrimble and actually unwrapping\nKing Of The Hill: \u201cUh, oh\u2026 ohhh:\nwell, I s\u2019pose it\u2019ll be good\u201d.\nTo top it off, the creators decided to\nshow the numbers were also on the\nside of Locke\u2019s mysterious hatch.\nOf course! Er\u2026 what the\nfuck?!\nHow random and tenuous a link is\nthat! It\u2019s like the pilled up writers\nhave been making this shit up as\nthe series progressed. God knows\nwhat\u2019s in the hatch. Well, I doubt\neven He does. Maybe we\u2019ll find out\nthat it\u2019s a gateway to another dimen-sion, or better still everything is just\na dream!\nWhat also pisses me off is all the\ninteresting story lines that have just\ndisappeared. Why did Ethan kidnap\nClare? Why did that man warn Clare\nshe mustn\u2019t have the baby? What\nabout the polar bears? How come\nLocke knew about Clare\u2019s birthday\nand Walt burning the\nraft? What\nabout Walt\u2019s gift? Fair enough to\nkeep the suspense, but are\nthese\never going\nto be resolved? The\nwriters will have to cram them in\nand I can envisage the\nfinal episodes being horribly overblown. The\nentire series could easily have been\nhalved. Lost was exciting, but the\npacing has been terrible. Maybe\nHurley\u2019s bad luck affected the script\ntoo? Whatever, this program needs a\nmiracle to save it.\nTomo Roberts\nG \u2019day you old bastards!\nI\u2019ve been as busy as a\none legged bloke in an\narse kicking contest,\nthis week.

    "content": "W\ninter is a season of extremes.\nIn December we\nstuff ourselves\nrepeatedly with\nChristmas fare\nand drink ourselves silly, then come\nJanuary we resolve to \u2018detox\u2019 and\nattempt to exist on celery. But is\nbecoming a herbivore for a month\nreally worth it?\nA quick flick through Carol\n\u2018Countdown\u2019 Vorderman\u2019s bestseller\n\u2018Detox for Life\u2019 reveals there is little\nyou can eat on the diet that normally\nappears in the everyday diet. Fruit\nand vegetables are in abundance\nbut you can\u2019t have meat, fish, dairy,\nbread, sugar, pasta, caffeine, alcohol\nor salt. Does the Sandwich Shop\nstock anything there that could be\nincluded in a detox diet? Not much,\napart from the complimentary slimy\napple. It comes across quite strongly that this diet requires military\nstyle preparation to avoid finding\nyourself abandoned in the middle of\ncollege at 6pm, starving with nothing to eat but the contents of the\ndepartment\u2019s vending machine. One\nreviewer from Amazon sums it up as\n\u2018Great, if you have no social life\u2019.\nIf the idea of preparing chickpea,\ncoriander and lime salad for dinner\ndoesn\u2019t take your fancy then why\nnot try one of the range of detox\nproducts on the market? For just\n\u00a319,99 you can buy Gillian McKeith\u2019s\n\u201824 hour detox programme\u2019 \u2013 a mix\nof seeds and dried vegetables that\nreplaces food for a day. Or how\nabout a detox juice, detox tea, detox\nmassage oil or even detox socks?\nCrazy as it seems they all exist. But\ndo they work? Not according to\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nfelix\nThursday 12 January 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\u2019Tis the season to... Detox\nEmma Turner looks at what the fuss is all about\nIf we ate a\ndecent diet,\nexercised a bit\nand stopped\nusing a pack of\nMarlboro like a\nfriend, no one\nwould need a\ndetox\nA\nnew London-based consultancy has been created to help\nfill the funding gap that so\noften leaves promising univer-sity-based projects dead in the\nwater.\nThe Advertising Through\nScience Bureau (ATSB) came into being on the\n9th January with the aim of marrying underfunded science projects with cash-rich companies \u2013 they want the scientific paper to be a\nmarketing outlet for the corporate sponsor.\nMerry Kingston, a founding director,\ndescribed the inspiration behind the ATSB:\n\u201cIn late 2005 we read about a research group\nthat had managed to create very detailed photographs using thin colonies of bacteria. The\nbacteria had been genetically modified to produce a dye on exposure to light and the group\ncunningly sugared the pill for the paper\u2019s publication by producing a bacteria-pic of the word\n\u2018Nature\u2019. This got us thinking \u2013 \u201cWhat if they\nhad instead written \u2018Kodak\u2019? They might have\ntapped a huge source of extra cash and taken\ntheir research much further.\u201d\nThe standard funding application process\ncan prevent much research from getting off\nthe ground and universities are reluctant to\ntake on sponsors for fear of seeming in hock to\ncorporate interests. The ATSB hopes to bring\nscience and big business to the same table, but\nin a way that gives researchers independence\nfrom any corporate motive.\nLarry Donaldson, another ATSB director,\nexplained the fund-raising process:\n\u201cWe match key features of the research proposal to certain corporate sponsors. We make\nsuggestions as to how publicised aspects of\nthe research could be modified to incorporate\nthe sponsor\u2019s name, logo or slogan and then\nnegotiate a fee with the sponsor. For instance,\nan immunology study could include images of\nlymphocytes arranged to spell out \u2018BUPA\u2019. Or,\ninstead of naming a new cloned animal \u2018Dolly\u2019\nor \u2018Snuppy\u2019, the group could pledge to call it\n\u2018Asda\u2019. This is simple but effective publicity.\u201d\nDonaldson went on to suggest that a laboratory test of lab rat maze-running could be\nmatched to Nike, who would provide Nike\nbranded rat-wear. The researchers could\nshave swooshes into the rats\u2019 fur. According\nto Donaldson this would automatically lend\n\u2018brand awareness\u2019 to an otherwise obscure\nresearch paper and provide easy publicity for\nthe sponsor. He went on:\n\u201cSteve Jones could have benefited from thousands of pounds of additional research money\nif only he\u2019d maximised the cross-marketing\npotentials of his earlier research into snail\nshells. Capitalising the \u2018S\u2019 in every instance\nof the word \u2018shell\u2019 in his papers would have\nyielded a healthy per-word payment.\u201d\nMerry Kingston then went on to reveal their\nplans for \u2018JargonBranding\u2019:\n\u201cMany existing scientific terms could be retroactively adjusted to incorporate company\nnames. The Advertising Through Science\nBureau would devise re-branded jargon and\nencourage the uptake of the new terminology\nwith per-use payments for scientific authors\nwho include the new terminology in any published paper. We\u2019ve already started work on a\ncampaign to brand-allocate parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. So far, we have Virgin\nRadio waves, InfraRed Bull and X-Factor rays,\nand we\u2019re negotiating our supplier for the\nmicro-wave band.\u201d\nThe newer\nscientist\na recent investigation by the charity\n\u2018Sense about science\u2019 who asked a\npanel of 11 dieticians and toxicologists about their scientific founda-tion. Detox products were slammed\nas a waste of time and money. One\npanelist comments that McKeith\u2019s\nrabbit food is unlikely to do what it\nsays on the tin, \u2018I don\u2019t see how it\ncan boost energy without carbohydrate or stimulants like caffeine\u2019.\nThe body does not accumulate\nnoxious chemicals over a stint of\nun-healthy eating as is commonly\nthought. Our very own Professor\nAlan Boobis OBE (Toxicologist at\nImperial) exposes the myth that we\nare somehow poisoning ourselves.\n\u2018The body\u2019s own detoxification systems are remarkably sophisticated\nand versatile. They have to be, as\nthe natural environment that we\nevolved in is hostile\u2019. This is verified\nby the fact that 36 hours of drinking\nan almost lethal dose of alcohol the\nbody will have expelled it naturally.\nThe reality is that people who start\non a detox program are doomed\nto fail due to an inherent lack of\nwillpower. OK, some people might\nhave a will of iron but after days of\ndeprivation even the strongest will\nstarts lusting after a cream cake.\nAnd from there it\u2019s a slippery slope.\nWhy do we put ourselves through\nit? It seems to be a phenomenon of\nthe British. There aren\u2019t many other\ncountries that flip-flop between the\ntwo states of binging and dieting.\nCould it be that we have not yet\nlearnt to eat well here? French restaurateur Raymond Blanc, founder\nof the Le Petit Blanc restaurant\nchain blames our binge drinking cul-ture. He claims that the lifestyle in\nMediterranean countries does not\nbreed such problems, \u2018we hardly\never drink without food. That is an\nEnglish invention \u2013 all those bars\nwith their happy hours.\u2019\nSo is the real problem that while\nworrying about which detox diet or\nproduct to try we are avoiding the\nissue and not addressing how the\ntoxins got there in the first place?\nIf everyone ate a decent diet, took a\nbit of exercise and stopped using a\npack of Marlboro Lights like a friend\nthen no one would need to detox.\nBut where\u2019s the fun in that? Granted\nat Imperial there are an unusually\nhigh proportion of people who do not\ngive in to the clich\u00e9 of student. They\ndon\u2019t drink, (alcohol interferes with\nthe ability to calculate) smoke and\nactually do eat a balanced diet. But\nfor those that do occasionally have a\nhalf at the union why not soften the\nlong term effects by trying a \u2018pretox\u2019\nTry having a balanced meal before\ngoing out with an emphasis on protein and vegetables (you\u2019ll make up\nthe carbohydrates in alcohol later)\nDon\u2019t forget to drink lots of water\nwhen you get home, get plenty of\nsleep and you should be fine.\nThe conclusion is transparent, eat\na normal balanced diet that includes\nfruit and veg and there is nothing\nwrong with a little indulgence now\nand again. There is no doubt that\nall the foliage in Carol V\u2019s book is\nhealthy and if you can eat it than\ngood for you. You\u2019re a better person\nthan me. But don\u2019t try to treat a nonexistent illness with useless products that have no scientific basis,\nunless you want to loose the wrong\nsort of pounds. Anyone want a second hand Carol Vorderman book?\nGet involved in the next\nissue of I,Science.\nE-mail i.science@ic.ac.uk\nDuncan\nMcMillan\n\n"

In fact, some of the lectures\nin the university are carried out in\nparallel single-sex streams.\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way; the\nUniversity, at the behest of the gov-ernment, is tending toward segregation rather than integration. This\nseems to be a step backward, systemic of the increasing influence of\nmore hardline Islamists in parlia-ment.\nBefore I left, friends generally held\nthe view that Kuwait was repressive\nin its attitudes towards women. This\nis far from the truth. At present,\nKuwait has more registered women\nvoters than men. Granting women\nthe vote had been a contentious\nissue, with parliament first voting\nagainst, but the Amir (the leader of\nthe royal family, who has ultimate\npower in how the country is run)\npushed the motion through.

Everywhere\nwe went, from the Stock Exchange\nto National Science Centre, women\nheld high positions of authority.\nContrary to the accepted wisdom\nthat Kuwait just rose from the desert\nafter oil was discovered, there is evidence suggesting Kuwait dates back\nmore than 500 years. Kuwait came\nto fruition during British territorial rule as a trading post between\nEurope and India. Kuwaitis as a\ntrading people date back further\nstill, to when dhows (traditional sail\nboats designed for calm waters)\nsailed between Kuwait, East Africa\nand the Indian subcontinent.\nThe next big boom was pearl\ndiving, which ended when the\nJapanese invented the cultured\npearl.

Kuwait has to be\none of the most inhospitable places\nin the world, its pure unadulterated desert stretching for mile after\nmile, one of those luna landscapes\nwith absolutely no elevation. The\ncountry has to import water, making crop production an impossibility;\nthousands of pounds alone must be\nspent on keeping ornamental flower\ngardens alive.\nThe 1991 Gulf War resulted from\nSaddam Hussein\u2019s thirst for wealth;\nKuwait has one third of the World\u2019s\noil reserves. The memories of the\nGulf war are still vivid in the minds\nof Kuwaitis, who mostly tried to stir\nclear of the subject. But those who\nwere probed a little further clearly held a deep resentment toward\nSaddam.\nDuring the war, Kuwait\u2019s oil fields\nwere a sea of flames as millions\nof dollars worth of oil was burned\nevery day. Although there are few\nobvious signs of the ravages of war,\nthe burnt out oil distribution centres\nare one stark reminder. Saddam\u2019s\ninvasion had elements of the recent\nUS military\u2019s shock and awe tactics:\nsilver was stripped from the top of\nthe iconic Kuwait towers.\nAlthough Kuwait is said to have\nat least 100 years of oil left, they are\nlooking to the future and other forms\nof income. The Kuwait Centre for the\nAdvancement of Science is spending considerable funds on research,\nincluding a grant to the Kuwait\nCentre for Studies of Research into\naquaculture. They have so far successfully bred Zubaidi, a popular\nspecies of fish in the Middle East,\nwhich had never been made to breed\nin captivity before.\nThe Kuwaitis themselves will be\nmy abiding memory of the coun-try. You really couldn\u2019t ask for a\nkinder, more hospitable bunch. We\nwere taken as friends into people\u2019s\nhomes and were generally treated\nfantastically.

Yes, that\u2019s right,\nwhile you were cold and miserable I\nwas swimming in the sea and having a BBQ. The food throughout\nthe trip was superb; shrimps bigger than your hand, succulent goat\nand kebabs that you don\u2019t need to\nbe totally off your face to consider\neating.\nWhich was fortunate, as there was\nno way of getting even slightly tipsy.\nAfter you collect your luggage at the\nairport, you have to pass it through\nanother X-ray machine.

In today\u2019s ever\nchanging world there are a\nmyriad of solutions to an infinitude of\ndiffering problems, ponderings and\n\u201csituations\u201d. One need not go into\nthe details of world conflict, peace\nprocesses or devastated regions to\nrealise this. Nor is it necessary to\nplunge into many of the complicated\ndiscourses concerning the (compar-atively) mundane events of our lives\nthat are beautifully small yet sweet,\nstable and happy. Ah, to be of the\nlucky few. Yet, what awaits ahead for\nour society is as frightening as that\nwhich has daunted our predeces-sors. It seems that although Utopia\nwas in reach, with resources easily\ndistributable and huge technological know-how, a world of uncertainty\nremains, and the visage of Utopia\nburns in ruin.\nI am not being pessimistic, and\nI am not simply giving in, saying\nthat \u201cits too hard, no more, let me\nout.\u201d But no matter the technol-ogy, knowledge or experiences of\nhumans in their individual nation\nstates, there will not be any mythological \u201cJustice\u201d. Compromise is\nthe sanctification of such a time.\nIt is the product of lengthy dis-cussions, whether over children\u2019s\npacked lunches being nicked by\none runt or the other, or peace\nnegotiations of any kind. Neither\nparty involved in a disagreement\nhas full acceptance over terms, yet\nboth agree to \u201cthe best possibilities\nfor now\u201d. To carry on with previous\ndemands on either side is deemed\nfoolish, costly and most uncertain.\nYou could lose your lunch, look\nstupid in front of your mates, lose a\nwar, lose a people. I am not a gambling man, but life is certainly not\na game. Are there any decisions in\nlife that are not debated between\nmen to be diluted or forsaken for\npetty gains simply due to a power\ninterplay between the concerned\nparties?\nThe simplicity of fairness\nAt face value\nImperial\nlooks very\nmulticultural,\nbut is it?\n\u201c\nOmar Hashmi\nfelix\nImperial lacks\nminority students\nAt face value Imperial looks very\nmulticultural, but a quick probe\nbeneath the surface reveals a\ndifferent story. At 41% Imperial\nhas one of the highest proportion of ethnic minority students,\nCambridge and Oxford have only\n12% and 9% respectively.\nAlthough a high proportion of\nstudents are from ethnic minority\ngroups, they are almost exclusively\ninternational students.\nThere is wide agreement\namongst the students and the\nCollege that the vast majority of\nhome students here are all white\nmiddle class. Felix believes that\nthis is something that needs to be\naddressed with haste.\nPlaces should be granted solely\non academic merit, and Imperial\nshould not introduce positive discriminatory measures. But College\nneeds to work hard to discover why\nso few British students from ethnic minority backgrounds are not\nNo 1339\nThursday\n12 January 2006\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nfelix\nThursday 12 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\u201d\nCompromise does not induce\nJustice, rather it can enshrine the\nopposite. It is compromise that\nshuts up someone of meagre stature in the hope that the mugger\nwill be appeased, and it is compromise that allows forced marriages\nand consequent rape because the\ngirl cannot adequately fend for\nherself. Whenever a new opinion\npresents itself, no matter how fair,\nsolutions must be compromised.\nYet there appears little else that\nwe can do. A constantly shifting\nset of goal posts to accommodate\never changing interests, we are a\npeople who think of the short term\npossibilities and not of fanciful ide-als. And it is for us that we think,\nwith the rest of humanity a blissfully distant second. Too right too,\nI do not want my provisions com-promised. If Utopia cannot exist\neverywhere, then let it exist for\nus here for the privileged few. Has\nit not always existed somewhere\nin the world, at the expense of\nthe rest? It is the nature of man,\nhis selfish gene, that leads me to\nthink that there will always be the\nstrong and the weak. His nature\nhas not changed, and nor have our\nproblems despite the advances in\nscience. I\u2019m not sure if there is any\nway to tell if we are a truly better\noff society globally than in the past,\nconsidering the potential that we\nhave squandered in front of us.\nNext week, see how much you\nhave to compromise. Of course,\nmy guess is that most of it is just\npoliteness. But do go find a good\ncause, and see what you can effect.\nAnd don\u2019t be superficial, but see if\nthe system works against you to\nthwart your little idea. Perhaps\nthat would convince you of the\nimpossibility of idealism. What\nwould it take for a man to not com-promise, to risk that little extra\nand not be bought off or sidelined?\nMore than food or money I\u2019m sure.\nI hope you all had good holidays.\nWelcome back to Imperial.\nstudying here.\nMichael Bajomo, Vice President\nof the Union\u2019s African Caribbean\nSociety (ACS) told Felix that some\nblack students tend to apply to\nUniversities with a well established\nblack community. If this is the\ncase, Universities that have large\nminority populations will continue\nto strengthen in diversity while oth-ers, such as Imperial, may flounder.\nThe problem is not unique to\nImperial, the situation is similar\nin all of the UK\u2019s more established\nuniversities.\nSports centre delayed\nHow long are we going to have to\nwait for the sports centre to open?\nThis extra delay is extremely\naggravating to all, but giving us one\nworking day\u2019s notice is completely\nunacceptable!\nMany students, including the\neditor of this newspaper, cancelled\nprivate gym memberships in the\nanticipation of the new centre opening and now have nowhere to train.\nLetters to the editor\nThe author of the \u2018star\u2019\nletter received each\nweek will win \u00a310\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n(The letter below was received in\nthis form.)\nHello again.\nOne of my colleagues made me\naware of your reply\nTo my previous email concerning\nthe low profile page 3\nOf the student magazine.\nFirstly I am from math department and secondly I am quite\nsceptic\nAbout the success of this page as\nyou state in your reply.\nI am pretty sure of something.\nThere are students that work\nhard for the prestige of this\nInstitution\nBut there others, like you in this\ncase, that lack of this feeling of\nbringing additional positive contribution\nTo Imperial College.\nIt\u2019s much easier filling 2 pages\nwith naked girls or boys than write\nfew more articles on science or\nsocial life or technology.\nYou could think about dedicate 1\nor 2 pages on outstanding past or\ncontemporary academics.\nReading about their lives and\nachievements would be a better\ninspiration for your readers than\nJust looking at photos of naked\nstudents.\nThirdly people do not complain\nbecause they devote their time to\nmore serious things.\nPlease try to appreciate the time\nI spent to write this email and most\nimportant\nI look forward to see a different\npage 3 in the next future.\nRegards\nAntonio Dalessandro\nElectrical Engineering PG\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nfelix\nThursday 12 January 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, has\nbeen awarded a two and a half year\nextension in his post. Imperial\nCollege Council is \u201cunanimous in\nits appreciation of the Rector\u2019s\nachievements for the College during\nthe past five years\u201d and have agreed\nto extend his term until the Summer\nof 2008.\nSir Richard was initially appointed Rector in January 2001, retaining his famed chairmanship of\nGlaxoSmithKline until early 2002.\nSince starting at Imperial, his\nactions have brought considerable\ncontroversy, including the rebranding and streamlining of Imperial\nCollege, his stance on top-up fees\nand instigation of the College dress\ncode. Throughout Sir Richard\u2019s\nterm, Imperial has retained a postion in the upper echelons of university league tables. Recently the\nSutton Trust report placed Imperial\nabove Oxford University as the second best UK institution.\nUnion President, Sameena\nMisbahuddin, told Felix, \u201cIn my\nopinion, with the College Centenary\napproaching, and new projects being\nembarked on in Wye, it\u2019s obvious\nCollege feel it\u2019s best to extend the\nRector\u2019s contract.\u201d\nMeurig Thomas, a third year\nRector\u2019s term extended\nMaterials Engineering Student, told\nFelix \u201cI think he\u2019s done a good job.\nLike anyone though, he\u2019s not per-fect. Yes, there have been some controversies and he\u2019s geared Imperial\nto be acting more like a business\nthan a traditional university - as far\nas research is concerned, the lecturers and academics act more like\nconsultants.\nFor the students, gone are the days\nwhen you can go into a Lecturer\u2019s\noffice and ask for advice. They seem\nto be bogged down in their own\nresearch and personal targets and\nthe focus has shifted away from\nundergraduate to postgraduate stu-dents. Sir Richard is obviously a\nvery ambitious person and he\u2019s got\nplans for the place but I think it\u2019s\nimportant for him not to lose sight of\nImperial\u2019s traditional strengths.\u201d\nOliver Todd, a fourth year Medical\nStudent, didn\u2019t have quite such a\npleasant account of Sir Richard\u2019s\nachievements, \u201cWe\u2019ve tasted the\nlegacy - every penny sucked out of\nundergraduate teaching whilst cool\npin-stripes in vacuous glass houses\nscheme the new Imperialism and\nit\u2019s global domination. The dream\ngoes on, Sykes\u2019 dream. And let\u2019s be\nfrank, there was never any choice.\nSykes will stay. Forever.\u201d It\u2019s appar-ent, at least to students such as\nTodd, that Sir Richard\u2019s success\ncomes at a price.\nIn the words of Bloc Party; \u201cTwo\nmore years, there\u2019s only two more\nyears\u201d.\nChris Miles\nOnly 15 Afro-Caribbean students at IC\nImperial College have decided to\nupdate and revise the controversial\ndress code after drawing complaints\nand protests from students, fearing it would violate their rights on\ncampus.\nThe new revised dress code states\nthat students are no longer required\nto have their College ID card on\ndisplay around the neck at all times,\nand clarified its position on hoodies\nand Hijabs, explicitly pointing out\nthat these are also not banned; however it has not reversed its decision\nagainst offensive dress.\nPart of the revision of the college\ndress code states that \u201cAt all times\nwhile on campus staff, students and\nvisitors must be able to present\ntheir ID card for inspection\u201d, whilst\nnoting that it is no longer a requirement that the ID card should be\nworn around the neck, but instead\nsuggesting that \u201cIn most circumstances it is recommended that the\ncard is visibly on display, for example clipped to a waistband or breast\npocket, or worn on a lanyard\u201d.\nAfter the furore that erupted over\nmisleading newspaper reports suggested that Hijabs and other religious dress was banned, the revised\ndress code goes to great pains to\npoint out that this is not the case,\nstating that \u201cThe wearing of items\narising from particular cultural/ religious norms (including\u2026hijabs\u2026)\nis seen as part of this welcome\ndiversity\u201d.\nThe dress code continues to state\nthat anything that covers a persons\nface (except for obvious health and\nsafety reasons) is not allowable, but\npoints out that hoodies and scarves\ncan still be worn, but not in such a\nway so as to \u201cnot promote effective\nsecurity\u201d.\nThe College\u2019s position on offensive dress remains, the wearing of\n\u201cobscene, racist, sexist or sectarian\u201d\nslogans \u201ccan result in a disciplinary\noffence\u201d.\nThe reversal has come as a shock\nto some students. \u201cI\u2019m surprised at\nthe news, since [the original code]\nwas never really enforced\u201d said\nOwen Parsons, first year physicist.\nMatthew Hartfield\nDress code rethink\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nWhat Not To Wear! Imperial\u2019s verision of Trinny and Susannah won\u2019t like you wearing a scarf, hoodie or \u201coffensive clothing\u201d (left).\nYou could be escourted off campus if you don\u2019t wear your swipe card around your neck (right). Imperial plc, here we come.\nImperial College have announced a\nstrict dress code for its students and\nstaff. Failure to comply could result\nin students being \u201cremoved from\nthe College\u2019s premises\u201d.\nThe dress code states that \u201cat all\ntimes while on campus staff and students must wear their College identity cards\u201d. On top of this employees\nand students are told to \u201crefrain\nfrom wearing clothing that obscures\nthe face such as a full or half veil,\nhooded tops or scarves worn across\nthe face\u201d. The rationale behind\nthis is that it will \u201cmaximise our\n[College\u2019s] chances of detecting the\npresence of anyone who shouldn\u2019t\nbe here\u201d. According to Imperial, this\ndress code has been implemented\n\u201cin light of security concerns raised\nby the terrorist incidents which\noccurred over the summer\u201d.\nThe ruling appears to be quite\nunenforceable as there are numerous entrances to the College, and\nthere is a public right of way straight\nthrough the middle of College along\nImperial College Road, connecting\nQueens Gate to Exhibition Road.\nIt is clear that College also have\ndoubts about the enforceability of\nthe ruling. An Imperial spokesperson told Felix, \u201cIt\u2019s not a question\nof it being enforceable \u2013 rather it\nis a question of College security.\nWe expect all students to take their\nContinued on page 3\nRupert Neate\nEditor\nFelix\u2019s campaign against the\ndress code was a success!\n(CRE) and Imperial Alumnus, said\n\u201cThis survey gives new meaning to\ninstitutionalised racism\u201d and it is\n\u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that segregation is\ntaking place between universities\nin Britain.\nThody referred to the comments\nmade by Trevor Phillips as \u201cnaive\u201d\nand said \u201cit\u2019s a simple fact of life\nat the moment that some of these\nminorities who\u2019ve been talked about\nare not making the grade at secondary school; it\u2019s not that we\u2019re refusing them.\u201d\nMichael Bajomo, Vice President of\nthe Imperial College Union\u2019s African\nCaribbean Society (ACS), criticised\nthe figures provided by HESA. He\nContinued from page 1 told Felix that the ACS had over 300\nmembers; although they weren\u2019t all\nof Afro-Caribbean decent, he said he\nknew more than 15 students person-ally. He questioned the validity of the\nUCAS-derived statistics as students\nare under no obligation to declare\ntheir ethnic origin when applying to\nuniversity.\nHe believes the real problem\nat Imperial is the \u201clack of British\nminorities\u201d and believes there is a\npredominance of white middle class\nstudents. \u201cThe number of black\nBritish students at Imperial must\nbe in single figures\u201d he continued.\nImperial seriously considers widening participation, some staff are\nrecruited with the sole purpose of\nraising aspirations and conducting mock interviews with underrepresented groups. Lindi Galloway,\nImperial\u2019s Director of Access, said,\n\u201cOur strategy is to reach as many\npeople as possible, particularly from\nnon-traditional areas including people who are not used to applying,\nto show them what\u2019s on offer and\nhelp raise aspirations. It has been\nhighly effective in terms of gaining applications from students who\nmight never have come to Imperial.\nWe\u2019ve been working on it solidly for\nsix years and are starting to see\nthe first students come through the\nsystem.\u201d\nControversially, Cambridge\nUniversity has introduced a positive\ndiscrimination quota system in an\nattempt to widen access to minority\ngroups. Thody told Felix, \u201cImperial\nCollege have not operated quotas,\nthat was a very high level decision.\nIt\u2019s quite a dangerous game to get\ninto; Cambridge and LSE have been\ndoing it. LSE have been secretly playing with quotas, in certain\nareas they\u2019ve taken a lot of black\nstudents.\u201d She assured Felix that\nat Imperial, admissions are based\nsolely on ability and are open to all.\nThere is some leeway at Imperial\nin the hands of admissions tutors,\n\u201cSupposing you\u2019ve got a straight\n\u2018A\u2019 student from Winchester and a\nstudent from a poorly performing\nschool with ABB both going for the\nsame place, then it\u2019s really up to the\nadmissions tutor to make that deci-sion. There\u2019s a very good chance\nthat the latter will be given a fair\nopportunity. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\nreasonable to say it will always go\nin favour of the poorly performing\nschool,\u201d said Thody.\nGalloway believes the \u201cproblem\nis in secondary education\u201d and that\n\u201cwe can do nothing about it. We lose\nlarge amounts of particular groups\nbecause they give up on their own\nsecondary education at a very early\nstage.\u201d The government have set\ntargets for Careers Advisers in\nschool, notably for low achievers, so\nthere is no longer such a focus on\nwidening particpation.\nThe last word from Galloway,\n\u201cunless the government increases\nfunding, the Rector will increase\ninternational recruitment.\u201d\nImperial\u2019s student executives have\ngiven the go-ahead to fund a charity\nconcert organised by students at\nthe College. The concert, known as\nMedXstock, hopes to raise public\nawareness and educate others on\nthe issues of HIV and AIDS.\nTwo years ago, I came up with the\nconcept to organise an annual outdoor concert to raise awareness and\nfunds for HIV worldwide, in particular - Africa. It has taken this long to\nfinally get the message out. Due to\nthe recent LIVE 8 concerts staged\naround the world, when our voice\nwas heavily muted, it felt that now\nis an appropriate time to restart\nthe campaign. MedXstock is associated with the International Student\nImperial students organise 20,000 people AIDS concert\nfield reaching 400,000 young people\neach year at an annual cost of just\n\u00a35 per child.

The unsigned bands will be\nselected through a nationwide competition already under way called\nRock Idols, set up by Imperial\nstudent Arjun Panesar. There will\nalso be an opportunity, through our\nMedXstock representatives at all\nother associated universities, for\nbands to send their demo CD\u2019s and\nbe in for a chance to play at the\nfestival.\nThere will also be a comedy arena,\na DJ tent and a chill out zone to\nadd variety on the day. African and\nAsian acts will also be performing\nthroughout the festival to emphasize which people the concert will be\ntruly benefitting.\nCurrently, we have applied to several councils to host the concert in\nLondon for the summer. An update\nof the venue and date will be confirmed by the end of the month.\nThrough the concert and national\nmedia coverage, issues surrounding\nHIV and AIDS will be brought into\nthe spotlight. Finally, MedXstock\nwill illustrate the dynamic, versatile and high-achieving capability of\nImperial\u2019s students in both an academic and organisational environ-ment.\nI am going to need a great committee and a massive support network\nworking alongside me.

For \u00a325 you can have a\n3-course set lunch menu.\nThe staff were very pleasant and\nJamie had even signed some bottles of olive oil (\u00a310 each) which you\ncould buy - my mum was extremely\nimpressed this Christmas!\nThe purpose of Fifteen is to inspire\ndisadvantaged young people to\nbelieve that they can create for\nthemselves a career in the restaurant business. The restaurant has\nhad thirty-seven young people graduate and many of them are now\nworking full-time in some of the\nworld\u2019s best restaurants. It is now\nthree years since Channel Four\u2019s\nshow, \u2018Jamie\u2019s Kitchen\u2019, followed the\ntrials and tribulations of Jamie\u2019s\nattempts to open a restaurant and\ncreate chances for young people. It\nhas been thirty six months of tremendous ups and downs. Fifteen is\nnow supporting their fourth group\nof young people - all of them unemployed when first recruited, many\nof them homeless or in care, others living with learning difficulties.\nAll profits from Fifteen go to the\nFifteen Foundation (the charity formerly known as Cheeky Chops), to\nprovide these young people with the\nworking environment in which to\nexpand their knowledge and practical experience.\n\u201cStudents at Fifteen do a 14 month\ncourse, which costs about \u00a318,000\nand includes work placement at restaurants and sourcing trips abroad.\nIn the words of Vicky Sharpe, London\nPA Restaurant Review:\n\u201cA restaurant certainly worthy of a\nvisit to sample simple but delicious\nfood and service that is slick and\nunpretentious\u201d.\nTo make a reservation, ring:\n0870 330 15 15.\nHannah Theodorou\nFood & Drink Editor\nincreases in insulin have actually\nnow been shown to encourage the\nbody to burn fat.\nEach plate of food you have should\nroughly be made up of 1/4 low GI\ncarbs, 1/4 low GI protein and 1/2 vegetables or salad.

Foods rich in glucose,\non the other hand, cause a surge\nin blood sugar levels and subsequent insulin levels which remove\nglucose from the blood. This leaves\nyou feeling lethargic, hungry and\ncraving another glucose hit. Low\nGI foods will instead cause steady\nrises in glucose, leading to a small\nand gentle increase in insulin.

Heard\nof him? I\u2019m sure you\nhave. He has done it\nall, from directing,\nwriting, to even act-ing. He did not just revolutionise\nthe world of romantic comedy with\nAnnie Hall, brought the world to its\nknees from laughter with Sleeper\nand created perhaps box-office\ndefying beauty in Manhattan. He\ntaught the world to find laughter in\nneuroticism.\nTwo-time Academy Award winner,\nand obviously millionaire (despite\nthe slightly screwed-up family life),\nhe obviously hasn\u2019t had enough\nvictories yet. For the first time in\ntheatre history, Woody Allen\u2019s short\nstories have been adapted into a\nplay entitled \u2018Woody Allen\u2019s Murder\nMysteries\u2019. And no, you don\u2019t have\nto bleed out of your sockets to pay\nfor the tickets (like you would have\nat the West End theatres). Being a\nstudent, you can get a ticket for less\nthan 10 pounds at the Warehouse\nTheatre in East Croydon. Hooray!\nNow, here\u2019s the scoop. The play\nis set in the 1940\u2019s New York state\nof mind, which is just rife with sex,\nseduction and scandal. The lead of\nthe story is Kaiser Lupowitz. The\nfirst mystery of the night is a search\nfor proof of the existence of God.\nAnd in detective stories like these,\nthere is always the busty, short-skirted blonde, Lucy. Oh god, such\na bore isn\u2019t it? You go for a play and\nyou expect a detective story but you\nget a religious diatribe.\nHold it right there. As with all\nWoody Allen stories, the key is to\nnot take it too seriously. The play\nis hilarious and entertaining, to say\nthe least. Led by a stellar cast, who\ndo not just act, sing and dance, they\nplay a multitude of musical instruments as well. Perfectly suited to\na cosy theatre such as Warehouse\nTheatre, prepare to be touched\nby the nostalgic rendition of love\nbetween Kaiser and his secretary\nand to be tickled by the extreme\nshallowness of Mendel, who visits\nhis dying friend in the hospital to\nmeet the hot new nurse.\nBeing a big fan of jazz and the\nblues, I was absolutely wowed by the\nfantastic music and saxophone-play-ing. And if you are a fan of jazz, you\u2019ll\nfall in love with the raspy, husky voices and the almost-dull but captivating monologue of Kaiser Lupowitz.\nSo was it a successful transition,\nyou ask, from movie screen to real\nlife acting? Put it this way, I\u2019ve seen\na lot of high-end musicals and plays\nbut this was the only one that almost\nbrought me to tears. Enjoy!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor Woody Allen: Murder Mysteries. A matter of great laughter rather than gore.\nJarhead: Touch down to reality\nI\nt is rare to find a war movie\naimed at depicting the realistic details of a soldier\u2019s life.\nJarhead, an exception to the\nrule, aims to tell the real-life\nstory of former U.S. marine Anthony\nSwofford (\u201cSwoff\u201d), based in Saudi\nArabia in the days leading up to and\nincluding Operation Desert Storm.\nIf you live with the idealistic notion\nthat war is about honour and glory,\nthis movie might just change your\nmind.\nUnlike other war movies, there\nis no obvious political agenda as\nthe movie neither supports war nor\ncondemns it. Instead, Jarhead is\njust a story of a marine, not some\nsuper-soldier who manages to defy\nall laws of common sense to miraculously survive unscathed in a major\nbattle. The movie starts off light\nwith the minor trials Swoff endures\nin enlisting but the realism strikes\nyou in the first 30 minutes after a\nrecruit is shot and killed in a training accident.\nHowever, there are some breathtaking scenes that give the viewers a break from the treacheries of\nDesert Storm, such as when Swoff\ntakes a break from digging a grave\nfor a deceased Kuwaiti amongst\nall the burning oil fields and has a\nchat with Staff Sgt Sykes (Jamie\nFoxx), and when Swoff meets an\noil-drenched horse amidst the same\noil fields.\nSwoff and his fellow marines are\ninitially excited when they are sent\nto Saudi Arabia. However, excitement quickly turns into boredom as\nthey wait to enter Kuwait to fight\nthe Iraqis. The marines even start to\nshow signs of eccentricity and insan-ity, such as when Swoff threatens\nand almost shoots another marine\nwhen the latter gets Swoff into trou-ble, or when Troy, Swoff\u2019s sniper\npartner, almost loses his mind when\nan officer deprives him of a chance\nto assassinate an Iraqi high ranking\nofficer.\nThough there are a couple of\nscenes where we see the marines\ncleaning and aiming their rifles, not a\nsingle shot was fired by the marines\nin the whole movie (until they celebrate the end of the war), which\nis another reason that makes this\nyour atypical war movie. However,\ndirector Sam Mendes still manages\nto make Jarhead one of the best war\nmovies around. Despite the eccentricities of the marines during their\ndays in the desert, the foul language\nused, and the less than subtle hint\nthat the marines are obviously sexually deprived, Jarhead is definitely a\nmovie worth watching, and it may\neven change your impression of soldiers in the armed forces.\nDaryl and I have both gone\nthrough 2 years of military training in Singapore before we entered\nuniversity. The movie was a realistic\nsummary of our own experiences\nand we both felt for the characters.\nDaryl Phua & Lin Hui Koh\nJarhead: What\u2019s war really about?\nWoody Allen Murder Mysteries\nVenue: Warehouse Theater\nPrice: \u00a39-\u00a311\nShowing from: 9 Dec - 19 Feb\nBox-office: 020 8680 4060\nHHHHI\nJarhead\nDirector: Sam Mendes\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Scott\nMacDonald and Lo Ming.\nLength: 123minutes\nCertificate: 15\nReleased:13 January 2005\nHHHHI\n\n"
