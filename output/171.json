He is worried,\nhe is not precisely sure what is worrying him\nor. even if he ought to be worried; everything\nseems to be alright, things are going very\nsmoothly yet something is wrong. I too have\nthis feeling. This Union is running smoothly\nand yet nothing is happening. It is all so very\nlike E.M. Focster's \"The Machine\" but let's hope this machine never runs down. For two\nyears now we have been saying that the lack\nof major conflict of opinions in the Union\nis a good thing, and after the upheaval of\ntwo year's ago perhaps a year of quiet smooth\nrunning was good. But this continuous nothingness bothers me. Bob Finch will soon\nleave us, the Coxes have gone, who is going\nto replace them? Where are the logical stir-rer s? There are none. Thus the efforts of the\n\"Top People\" are not needed to constrict\nand fight; this leaves lots of mischief for idle\nhands. In addition we seem to have no life\nor character at the top. Yet top people need\nto justify themselves, and if their character\n(or if you prefer it \u2014 sport) will not leave\nits mark then the only other way to be remembered is to make changes. And these big\nbusiness methods and regimentation s are beginning to worry me, or perhaps even that\nis not true, perhaps its just that I ought to\nbe worried. It's nothing big, but perhaps that\nwill come, it's just the little things and what\none can infer to have gone on behind them.\nFor example what an awful lot of time must\nhave been spent working out plans and\ncounter plans for this \"Publicity Board\" envisaged by the Executive, and how much effort must have gone into making the proposed amendment to the \u201eBlue Book\" to\ncreate a Deputy President. And why? Do\nwe need a Deputy President, i.e. somone W. K> can take over the responsibilities of the President if needed. Of course we do, but do we\nneed to be regimented and have all this con-st it ut ional is ed. This Union has always prided\nitself on being sensible and somewhat mat-ure, hence the total absence of standing orders etc., yet now I.C. Union Inc. seems to\nbe coming nearer.

Presumably any\nDeputy President will be elected from VicePresidents (we don't seem to have many more\nthan four presidential types judging by the\ndearth of nominations in last year ls elect-ions) and they are more capable of judging\nwho is best for any task at the time, so\nwhy elect a man at the beginning of the ses-sion?

The dialogue was unprintable, but the operation a success, Clementine reached Brighton es\ncorte d by other college mascots (Bo and Jez).\nSince the tragic loss of the grand old traction engine, the mechanical prowess of Mines\nhad been dormant.

Meetings are held\nregularly.)\nFELIX\nBird's Eye View\nANIC WAR IAN LOOKS AT MEN. Men can be the most infuriating creatures!\nHalf the time they act as though they are the\nlords of creation, and the rest of the time\nthey act like spoilt little brats. Not all \"f them are like this, but unfortunately for the\ngentle sex, most of them are. Let me try to\nclassify them.\n1. The smooth, sophisticated woman-eater.\nThis type of man makes me feel ill. He\nuses perfumed after-shave lotion, is always\nimmaculately dressed and, probably, wears\nbrightly coloured underwear. He tries to give\nthe impression that he is a wolf, but it usually turns out that he loves to chase but is\nterrified of catching. In America, he's a snob.\n2. The beer y, rugby-player.\nThis one can be guaranteed to turn up late,\ndrunk and unshaven, if he turns up at all\nthat is. His at it ude is unashamedly lecher-o us, and he's proud of it. Although he can\nbe an absolute swine, at least his intentions\nare obvious, and easily avoided.\n3. The answer to the maiden's prayer.\nThis type is the limit. His conceit is enormous and only exceeded by his bad manners.\nHe gives the impression that to be taken out\nby him is the greatest thing that can happen\nto a woman. The only cure is to ignore him\ncompletely. This will puzzle him, and hill hang around for a while trying to find out\nwhy you won't take any notice of him.\nwill do him nothing but good.\nFILM\n\"THE WAGES OF FEAR\"\nFriday, Februay 2nd,7.00 p.m. Concert Hall.\nThe name of Clouzot, coupled with that\nof Bardot, may be familiar to many underground users, for Clouzot directed \"La Verite\". It was \"Le Salaire de la Peur\" (\"The\nWages of Fear\") that first brought fame and\nrecognition to Clouzot by winning the Cannes\nGrand Prix in 1953. Clouzot followed it with\n\"Les Diaboliques\" (\"The Fiends\"). All these\nfilms seek to horrify the audience and to produce an atmosphere full of suspense.\n\"The Wages of Fear\" has a simple, direct\nplot. In a small town in Central America,\nhave collected all the tough down-and-outs\nwho have nowhere else to go \u2014 bored, penniless and desperate men ready to do anything.\nThey get their chance when they are offered\nmoney to drive two truck loads of nitroglycerine 300 miles. Four \"lucky\" men are picked\nand the nightmare journey begins. Two thirds\nof the film is devoted to this agonising drive\nalong dirt roads over which a slight jolt might\nblow the lorry and men to pieces. Clouzot\ndevelops the excitement so well that the tension almost becomes unbearable. The film\ncontains some brilliant d erection, photography\nand acting by the four men (Yves Montand,\nCharles Venel, Folco LuIIi and Peter Eyck).\nIts only weakness is an ending far too ironic\nand pessimistic, which could have been cut\nwithout altering the bulk of the film. Clouzot\njust overdid it. o.J. w.4. The intellectual.\nPassionately interested in the arts, but only\nthe modern ones, anxious to discuss his views\non sex, and, appa ren ly, totally uninterested\nin anything but a platonic friendship, this\ntype is dangerous. You will find that having\nbeen lured into agreeing with his \"advanced\"\nviews on sex, he will suddenly try a little\npractical work on you. To be avoided like\nthe plague.\n5. The reasonable blok e. If by any chance your lucky star is in the\nascendant ,you might meet one. He won't be\nperfect (no man ever is), but he'll be reasonably interested in you as a person, and just\nmasculine enough to be bearable. He won'tt)e too big-headed and with a bit of luck he\nmight marry you.\n1 hope nobody thinks that I'm over-crit-ical, but I speak from experience and if any\ngentleman feels annoyed with this article, per\nhap s he ought to take a good look at himself and see if he can ri d himself of some,\nif not at all, of the qualities which annoy the\ngentle sex so much.\nI.C.D. S. After a run of beat, off-beat and possibly\ndead-beat \u2014 drama, the Dram. Soc. have decided to give both the1 audience and themselves a break. The choice fell between\n\"Charley's Aunt\" and \"Arsenic and Old\nLace\", \u2014 the scientific appeal of the latter\nwon.\nSet in Brooklyn, it is soon apparent that\n\"The sport of my mad aunts\" is to extend\ncharity to the grave1. A cast of 14 work their\nway through every conceivable (and a few\ninconceivable) situations created for them by\na master play-wright, Joseph Hesselry. For\nonce the problem or interpretation does not\nexist \u2014 the play was written simply (but not\nvery purely) for laughs.\nThe formula of \"old ones \u2014\u2022 young ones\"\nis being applied again to the casting, the Society working on the principle that merit\ncounts most. If that basketball playing crumb\nhas crept in again, it's not the producer's fault.\nDates are 13th to 16th March, and if you\nwant that seat near the aisle (to facilitate\nrolling) you'd better book now.\nLAMLEY'S TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS\nART MATERIALS DRAWING INSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY PAPERBACK St.3&5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7.

He was 21; Mr. Gilbert was born in\nLancashire and was educated at Burnley\nGrammar School, and the Thwaittes Ramsbottom Ladies Finishing School, Lower Darwen. He came to City and Guilds in 1958\nto study Mechanical Enginering and while\nin his second year, the notorious Mr. Mike\nBarron, then the Editor of Felix, remarking\non the high quality of his lecture note doo d les, appointed him Deputy Production Manager's Assistant. Mr. Gilbert's virtuosity in\nthe handling of Cow Gum, the vital substance which has held together countless Felices, earned him the respect of all, and several times he was priv il edged to carry the\nCow Gum tin in his pocket.\nEven allowing for his gullibility, promotion was rapid and in 1961 he was appointed\nEditor from a short list of one. During the\nlatter part of last term it was obvious that\nthe bu c den of his re ep on sibi lit lies wa js too\nmuch for him and the screaming hab ber jabber attacks became more and more frequent, together with occasional outbursts of Felixphobia when he was driven to tearing Felices\ninto small pieces.\nII Dear Sir,\nWe read with bewilderment in the national\npress recently of the decision of the authorities at Oxford University to allow one of the\ncollege buildings to be modified for use as\na nuclear fall-out shelter, and that the undergraduates are to be instructed on the procedure to adopt under conditions of nuclear\nwar. Several times in the article in question\nit is asserted that this is not a panic measure\nbn the part of the authorities; in fact this\npoint is made so strongly that we begin to\nwonder- Could it be that this obvious effort\nto console the general public by the originator of this scheme is an expression of his\nown fear! Are we to allow individuals such\nas this to infect the country with the germs\nof nuclear panic as has happened in America? Do we accept the thesis that a nuclear\nholocaust is inevitable? Of course not\\ The\nwhole concept is so rid i colo us as to be almost beyond the bounds of crude lit y. Surely\nthere is sufficient common sense in Britain\nto crush such moves as this even if there is not\nin America. Such reasoning as led to this\ndecision can clearly be considered as a vote\nof no confidence in the present government's policy. We, on the other hand, have complete faith in this policy, and should therefore like to register our whole-hearted disapproval of this scheme.\nYours sincerely,\nB.A. TAYLOR, K.J. HEARN\nDear Sir,\nI am appalled that a newspaper of supposedly neutral political feelings should print\nsuch biased rubbish as was contained in the\nletter about Yorkshire Pudding.\nThose blasted Yorkshiremen (?) seem to\nthink that the whole world revolves around\nthe making and consumption of the nauseous concoction mis named pudding.\nHow can anyone of supposedly average intelligence consider a mixture of flour and\nwater, and I know not what else, to be the\nnectar and ambrosia that it is made out to\nbe by Yorkshirmen?\nI am making this protest on behalf of the\n\"League for the Preservation and Perpetuattion of Lancashire Hot-Pot\", so that this regally noble dish can have a fair hearing in\nyour columns (and anyone who had heard a Lancashire Hot-Pot in full cry really knows\nit).\nThis is really a most wonderful dish, far\nsuperior to that lump of inanimate splodge\ncalled Yorkshire Pudding.\n1 thank you for the indulgence of your\ncolumns and remain,\nYour obedient servant,\nABDUL BEN MAHMOUD Secretary to the Honourable League for the\nPreservation and Perpetuation of Lancashire\nHot-Pot.\nDear Sir,\nDuring my first few months residence in\nyour country I have been learning much. I can now understand the reasons for which\nyour country ha.i suffered much decline in\nthese last few decades. A brilliant example\nof this was given in your last edition bearing the title \"Beware the International Hotchpotch\". The ace reporter Crunnion Lineage\nobviously did not know that soon after the\ncease of the World War II the International\nStudent Conference broke away from the International Union of Students. This was the\nresult of the selfish and short sighted attitude of a small but noisy group of right wing\nextremists mostly from America. However,\nthe IUS is best without these people. Your\nfe porter said that the IUS is a communist\npropaganda group concerned with the subversion of immature nations which have only\nrecently broken away from the maternal care\nof the British Empire. There are many things\nthat I am able to say about this. First that the\nword \"Communist\" should be printed with\na big C and not little c. In my country Commusism is as important as Socialism or CND\nin your country even if not more so. Second,\nyour reporter is all wrong about the IUS\n\"sub ve rion of immature nations\". He is obviously as tbol pid geon of the \"Daily Express\" or \"Guardian\" or something like that.\nHe is right that these nations recently in the\nBritish Empire are immature. This is because\ntheir life blood has been squeezed from them\nby grasping British capitalists. Monuments\nto their destruction have been built ever since\nthe time of Christopher Wren. This is not\nsubversion which your reporter talks about,\nthis wonderful technical aid made possible\nby the great social revolution in my country.\nYour reporter finishes his article by reap it ing some words of Lord Beaverbrook. I shall do\nthis also. Did not Lord Beaverbrook say that\nwhen he took control of the \"Daily Express\"\nhe also took control of two million minds.\nThis shows well how the capitalists are in\ncontrol of the masses and cause them to follow their direction. In my coutry this is im-possible. All the newspaper are co-ordinated\nby the State so that the masses are caused to\nthink in logical positivism.\nF.R. N EYE CHE CAPTAIN'S LAMENT OR CRY? Dear Sir,\nIt will probably be reported elsewhere in\nthis, most excellent of papers, that once again the sporting teams of Imperial College\nhave su mounted the usual early hurdles and\nare now on the the trophy trail again. For\nseveral seasons the senior college athletic\nclubs have succeeded in winning their respective University trophies, so that now a great\nmany people in the College regard cup ties\nas mere formalities, and do not give their\nsupport; there is nothing quite like scoring\nthe winning try or goal to the thunderous\napplause of your own supporters.\nThis year the clubs, can boast 28 supporters distributed in the following manner;\nRugby 18\nSoccer 7\nHockey 1\nBasketball 2\nor for the statisticians present 1 % of the College. All the games were well advertised with\nthe todays sport board, and seperate notices\ntoo, so the publicity cannot readily be at\nfault. In the next couple of weeks we\nwill be playing in four semi-finals, and should\nmuch appreciate your support. Coaches are\nprovided to Harlington, and the U.L. U. gym.\nis in Malet Stree.\nYqwts truly,\nJ. Pv KE HOE, I.C. R.F.C. Capt.\nD. HARBURN, I.C.A. F.C. Capt.\nD. PHILLIPS, I.C.H. C. Capt.\nM. BARRON, I. C.B.B.C. Capt.\n\n"

FOOTBALL( EASY PASSAGE)\nThree victories in a week saw the I.C. nearer to another clean sweep of the University\nsports cups. The football club drew a home\nmatch with Battersea in the 2nd round and\non Wednesday, 17th January, after a strange toss up decision, Battersea el-elected to kick against the wind. In the first\nhalf, the I.C. forwards seized on this obvious\nerror, and within five minutes centre-forward\nDenny Vaughan put I.C. into the lead when\nhe chipped in a hard shot the goalkeeper\nwas unable to hold. The opposition were not\ndespondent, and playing a much better brand\nof football, soon equalise d, retaining control\nof the game up to half-time\nAfter t ne teams changed\nends, the wind had lessened considerably,\nbut even without that assistance I.C once again took charge. Within several minutes John Preece put l.C. back\ninto the lead when the Battersea goalkeeper failed to stop a hard shot from\njust inside the penalty area. From then\non it was a very one-sided battle, Battersea's two University players being blotted right out\nof the game. Preece added another and two\nsolo efforts gave Denny Vaughan a fine hat\ntrick. Colin Casamore completed the scoring with aw rill i ant header. So the I.C. team\ncontinue on their winning way; with an easy\nnext round against either the School of\nPharmacy or Birbeck the team is again confident of reaching the final.\n2. BASKETBALL( ROUGH HOUSE)\nA few hours later in the U.L. gym. it was\nthe turn of the Basketball team to try their\nluck. Their opposition, Northern Poly did not\nhave an impressive record and the roughness of their play was indeed a reflection of\nthis. It was in this game that the coaching\"\nmethods of Gordon Leslie were put to the\ntest, and it was felt that the roughness of\nthe opposition, and not I.C.'s inability to ap$\u2022 ply them were the reason for the score being\nso low at half-time (H.T.2812. In the sec-on d half the standard did not improve much,\nand when the final whistle went, although the\nteam won 45-21, there was an air of despondency around.\n3. RUGBY( WESTON CONTAINED)\nThe 2nd round of the Gutteridge Cup,\nsaw I.C. once again drawn against CEM. After a change in venue, it was decided to\nplay at Harlington, and with the grounds-men's work done, and a wary eye on the\nsky. the two teams took the field. Play settled down quickly, but in one of the first loose\nscrum, an angry fist resulted in a penalty\nbeing awarded to CEM. As Mike Weston\nshaped up for the kick, which was just inside\nthe half-way line, there were a few anxious\nfaces among the l.C sur jp br ter s. For Weston,\nof England. Durham and Richmond fame\nwas known to be no mean exponent in the\nart of kicking, but his effort came to no good,\nand there was a notable sigh of relief. In\none of the first l'.C. attacking movements\nthe two centres Johnson and Butler sliced\nthrough the defence with arrogant ease, but\na forward pass ended a promising movement.\nWith the wind against them the I.C. tactics\nwere to hug the left touch line and they did\nthis well with scrum-half Alan Smith's astute\nkicks being a tremendous asset. But the biggest danger to I.C. was still Weston, and\nhow near he came to stealing the glory in\nthe first half. With two bursts through the\nmiddle he left the I.C. team flat footed, but\nthe forwards' covering was magnificent^ and\nwhere the backs failed, they succeeded, and\nthe England centre was well stopped. In this\nfirst half the I.C. pack played superbly, Mike\nVine's hooking was of very fine calibre, and\nably propped by Chris Liddle, and last minute substitute Bernie Ravano, the front row dominated the tight scrum s. The wing forwards\ncontained the CEM halfbacks well, Ray Milward's tackling of M. Weston being of special note. Neither side looked like scoring, although CEM went very close, after a Weston\nkick-ahead brought play onto the IC line.\nWith the wind now at their backs and the\nscore sheet still blank things looked well for\nthe College, but that man was at it again;\na kick-ahead, a lucky bounce and Weston\nlinked up with his three-quarters in a most\ndangerous looking movement, but fullback,\nJohn Edwards, whose play in the first half\nhad been faultless, rose to the occasion, and\nwith a brilliant tackle nipped another scoring effort in the bud. Mid-way through the\nsecond-half the I.C. pack began to assert it-self; with Vine in complete charge of tight\nscrum s. Bob Hunt and John Fairfield, the\nline-outs; Ravano ruling the loose, and the\nwing forwards now looking after Weston. A midfield infringement resulted in a penalty\nto I.C. but John Fairfield's kick although ac-curate, lacked length, and the score remained\nnil each. Then came a very trying period of\nten minutes with the' play around the I.C. line, but the pack held out, and another one\nof those nagging Smith kicks relieved the pre s sure. Play then dramatically switched to the\nother end and with time running out, I.C threw everything into attack. A near pushover try, a kick-ahead, a Smith solo run, resulted in three consequent drop-outs by\nWeston. With a minute to go Smith once again made an inside break, but this time he\neluded Weston linked with the other backs,\nand Johnson crossed the line to give I'.C. the lead. Smith failed to convert, but the final whistle soon came and victory was ours.\nIn such a magnificent game it is difficult\nto pick out players for merit. Weston of course\nshowed us all why he has played 10 consecutive games for England, Smith what a brilliant and deceptive scrum-half he is; but\nspecial mention must go to Jim Kehoe, who\nas skipper led his men in line fashion setting an example by his play and encourage-ment.\n\n"

In\nthe meantime many millions must starve.\nPlagues which are unknown in Britain will\nsweep through crowded slums. Flood, fam-ine, war will take their toll.

    "content": "SPORT RUGBY\nSince the last report the 1st XV has played\n4 games one of which appears fully reported\nelsewhere.\nThe B3 and B5 still continue their unbeaten runs although the B3's have at last had\ntheir line crossed during 20-8 victory over\nOsterley \" B\". On the morning of the England-Wales\nmatch a minor International was staged at\nHarlington where IC lost by 6-0 to Aberystwyth (the reigning U.W. Champions) in a very\nclose game. This could have been a win for\nI.C. but for the old bogey of poor tackling\nwhich has been with the side for some time.\nOf the other two 1st team games I.C. beat\nR.AF. Cadets at Henlow and lost to Wasps\nVandals. The Ex. 1st XV have recorded two\nwins one of which was a fine 19-0 victory\nover Aberstwyth 2nd XV. The \" A\" team continue to improve and\nhow have six consecutive victories to their\ncredit including a160 win over Brighton\nStudents an 8-0 win over Avery Hill T.C. The results of these two teams are much more\nindicative of their true form after both had\nexperienced a poor start to the season.\nA403 win over Brighton Students 2nd XV gave the Ex. A their best result of the season\nand even though they turned up with 17 men\n(an unheard of thing in I.C. Rugby circles)\ntor the following game they still lost 11-0 to\nthe National College of Food Technology.\nOf the other sides the Bl' s have not a game for the past fortnight due to cancellations and i\" Jim's Team\" the B2's have pro\nduce d one win and one draw.\nMINES SUCCEED WHERE I.C. FAILS On Wednesday, 24th January, Mines Rugby\ntook on the might of \" C\" Division who had\nproved only too victorious in their previous\nencounter with I.C. in the region of the\nU.L. U. Baths last December.\nOn this more recent occasion, the Students\nproved successful and Mines got home winning by 11 points to 10. Obviously no wasted\nenergy. Scorers for Mines were Rawlings and\nMcManus. one try each and Turner with\none occasion and one penalty goal.\n\" C\" Division scored their first five points\nafter two minutes play, but half-time saw the\nscore at 8-5 for Mines, and a penalty goal\nearly in the second half made the game sec-ure. The game stood at 11-5 with five minutes from no-side when an unlucky bounce\nfrom a high kick ahead, which had appeared\nwell covered, presented an e as v try and the\nsubsequent conversion left the score at 11-10.\nFor any student desiring revenge in\nmore concrete manner, we hope that the\nfact that one of the opposition finished the\ngame with no vision from his right eye, after\nsome pretty rug ger tackling by the back row,\nwill be of interest.\nPW L FA1st XV12102155302 nd XV128417281 BASKET BALL\nThe Basketball Club has continued its successful season and apart from an unfortunate\nsorte e into the National Championships its\nrecord now stand at:\nPW LF A11101684437 The team's success is largely due to our\ntwo 6ft3 Americans David Inkster and John\nRupf and 6 ft. 5, Alex Termanis. Mention\nmust also be made of our hot-shot Canadians Ray Thomas, Gordon Leslie (coach) and,\nespecially, Oscar Sigvaldason. The rest of the\nsquad are George Velissariou, Mike Barron\n(Capt.), Mike Coward and Dennis Wickenden.\nThe first game this term against Northern\nPoly was a very scrappy affair and IC came\nout easy winners, 45-21. Next we travel lea to Watford to play Pegasus and won 40-23\nto take over the lead in-the London League\nDivision I. In Pegasus we came against our\ntoughest defence for the season and in the\nfirst half were trailing 10-15 in a very low\nscoring game. Play continued tough in the\nsecond half and culminated in coach Leslie\nbeing ordered off tor attempting to cream\nthrough three defenders without the ball in\nhis hands! After that we steadied down and\ntook control of the game. With David Inkster working wonders under their basket we\ntook the half 30-8.\nThe next game saw a welcome return to\nform of John Rupf and his 26 points helped\nus to beat East Ham xx mv inc ingly5737. The\ncoming few weeks are the clubs most important ones as we are now in striking distance\nof winning two League competitions and two\ncups. During the Easter Vac we are going\nto Holland to take part in an International\nUniversities Basketball Tournament.\nSOCCER\nThe 1st XI moved to the top of the UL league by virtue of an easy 4-1 win over LSE last Wednesday, Mike Cox scoring a hat\ntrick. However, the 1st still remains without\na win on a Saturday after an unlucky defeat\nby Reading, 4-3, and a crushing defeat by\nDulwitch Hamlet \" A\",40, which would\nhave been less had the Engineers' DinnerDance not claimed our goalkeeper, Andy\nPayne.\nThe 2nd XI continue to suffer from 1st team injuries and one victory this term was\nachieved with 4 winners on the forward line\nwhen the beat Goldsmiths II, 5-2, in the\nleague, although the previous week they were\nbeaten 3-1 by a very strong QM C II team i\" the UL Cup.\nThe 3rd XI keep IC hopes alive in the UL Reserve Cup with a31 victory over Kings\nIII, and should reach the final of this competition as their next game should be a fairly easy one. Their position at the top of their\ndivision in the league was weakened last week\nwhen they only managed to draw with the\n4th XI,11, and lost to Battersea II.\nWithout a win before Xmas, the 4th broKe\nthis dismal record by crushing St. Clement\nDanes III, 10-0, and they have only lost 1\nout of the 4 games since f Xmas. The 5th XI have won their 3 League games this term and\nconsequently are well placed in their division of the League.\nThe 6th and 7th XI's continue their up\nand down form, although Ben's men march\non with 5-1, 6-0, and 7-1, victories to their\ncredit this term.\nL7R EP ORTON THE EXTRA7 TH The Extra Seventh XI have had the most\nsuccessful season of any of the soccer clubs\neight teams. The record is:\nP_14, W \u201410, D \u20143, L \u20141, F \u201469, A \u201427.\nSo far in 1962, the team has won all three\nmatches:\nv. Polytechnic Won 5-7\nv. Shuttleworth Won 6-0\nv. Barclay Bank Won 7-1\nThe team has always tried to play football\nand have usually been successful. The team\nhas a good solid defence, strong attacK in,, half-backs, and devastating forwards who\nhave paralysed most defences.\nThe goalkeeper is usually Nash, whose anticipation and agility have covered the few\nmistakes made by the defence. The full-backs\nhave been chosen from Spreadborough, Kendelon and McManus. Spreadborough and\nKendelon, both over six feet, have found\nmany ways of stopping their opponents.\nMcManus is of the Sellers mould. His strength\nand tenacity have been tried in the forward\nline where deceiving heading has been most\neffective.\nThe half-backs have been very strong with\nthe choice of Murcott, Wheeler, Davies and\nWebster. Murcott's tackling and passing have\nbeen a joy to watch and Wheeler's ability\nto kick the ball anywhere has retrieved many\nawkward situations. Murcott and Wheeler\nhave covered well, especially since Davie and\nWebster, both getting on now, have found\nthe pace too much. However, they do manage to put up good shows.\nThe inside trio is Hendley, Logan and\nBond. Hendley's fine scheming brain has resulted in many goads, whilst Logan and\nBond have taken most of their chances with\naccurate shooting. On the left wing Mitchell's speed has only to be compared with Brabrook. Unfortunately in his ability to centre\nthe ball he also resembles that vastly overrated player. There has been no regular out-side-left, and the selection committee have\neven had to resort in playing Wilshaw. However, this should be remembered in due\ncourse.\nBADMINTON\nOn January 10th our first team arrived\nat our home courts to find two teams, Northern Poly and NEC waiting to play us. Nothing daunted, IC played both teams simultaneously! The result was two 7-2 wins for\nIC. There remains but one league game to\nbe played, against UC and since both teams\nare undefeated this year, an interesting game\nis in prospect.\nThe ladies team is also undefeated, their\nmost recent success being 5-4 against QE C The mixed team beat King's despite some\nrather indifferent play by 5-4. It is unfortunate that we played UC as the first mixed\nmatch of the season since the team is now\nforming a much better combination.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College, London, S.W.7.

Union.\nSKI CLUB\nIn the hope of promoting an interest in\nski-ing and improving the standard of the\nsport within the College, a party of 34 de-parted,, by train, from London for Solden\nin Austria, for 15 days ski-ing, during the\nChristmas vacation.\nThe first two days ski-ing were made difficult by insufficient snow, ironically at this\ntime many parts of England had up to a foot\nof snow, while many ski-ing resorts had none.\nHowever, on the third day a moderate fall\nrestored the slopes to a reasonable condition.\nThere followed a week of nearly continuous\nsun which made for the most enjoyable ski-ing.\nIt was very encouraging to see the rapid\nprogress made by the beginners. Several were\nindeed quite outstanding in their enthusiasm\nand drive. One notable gentleman (I hope\nhe will not mind being so called) was indeed\nonly one second behind his instructor over\nthe Silver Medal course for beginners. Needless to say he won a medal and put up the\nbest time amongst the other competitors.\nSeveral members of the group paid a visit\nto the nearby ski-ing centre of Obergurgl. Unfortunately the valley gets little sun at this\ntime of the year, but the facilities are good\nand it is certainly to be recommended for\nspring ski-ing. On the last day in Austria,\nthree of our members entered for the Standard Slalam in Obergurgl, one finished first\nthus winning a Silver Mejial and another\ncame fifth and was awarded a Bronze Medal.\nBesides ski-fin g there were several other\nwinters sports to be enjoyed, notably skating and tobogganing. The latter took place\non the tortuous and precipitous road between\nHochsolden and Solden; a distance of 4 kilometres with a vertical descent of well over\n1500 feet. Curiously enough there seemed to\nbe a very high failure rate amongst the to-f bog gans. Similarity several ski tips were seen\nto litter the slopes. Whether this was due to\nstrong bones or weak wood is difficult to say.\nNevertheless, injuries were confined to a few\nsprains and one cut knee.\nIn the evenings those who still had some\nenergy went out to one of the several hotels\nwith bands, and there danced and drank considerable quantities of the local wine; the latter is quite potent, as one or two people found\nout the hard way. Unfortunately 8 people,\nmostly girls, had to return to England early,\nthus the last few days the ratio of male to\nfemale became rather too high. The main\nbody of the party returned to London a week\nlater.\nJ.R. W. K.I. C. W.S.C. Despite illness, exam, fever and fixtures\ncoinciding, ICWSC has continued to do wet t in matches this year. In a new venture the\ntable tennis team played in a mixed match\nagainst Northern Polytechnic which they lost\nafter some excellent games with the final\nscore 7-2.\nOther results this term:\nBadmington: Beat QE C by 7-2.\nHockey: Lost to Westfield, 2-3 (Due to\ninjury we played with one wing for most\nof the match).\nNetball: Beat Royal Holloway II by 10-6.\nSquash: Beat Bedford 4-1, Cardiff University, 3-2.\nSpecial praise to Mary Rawitzer for two\nexcellent games.\nTable tennis: Beat QE C,63.P.R. DEBATING SOCIETY\nThe Debating Society has a very heavy\nprogramme before it this term, which includes\nthe Inter-Collegiate Debating Competition\nwhich will be held on Thursday Feb. 8th,15 th, and 22nd. This is the second year the\ncompetition has been held and the holders.\nGuilds, will be doing their best to retain the\ncup. In addition to this and the usual fortnightly debates, we shall be visited in February by two very experienced American debaters who will be touring the country, ft\nwill be very interesting to com per e our own\nstandards with those of the U.S.A. Later during the term, the Dinner will be\nheld, at which the Cup will be presented to\nthe winning College. It is hoped that the Dinner will be as great a success as last year,\nand that everyone who enjoys good food as\nmuch as good speaking will come along.\nSWIM* Hi\nCLUB\nAfter two rounds of the UL Water Polo\nLeague, the two top IC teams stand a strong\nchance of coming out on top. If the Firsts\ncan maintain the form that gave an overwhelming 7-3 victory against Barts Hospital,\nthey have a great chance of toppling NCL and regaining the cup after last year's fall\nThe Thirds are still with a fighting chance\nof coming out on top.\nTeam P WDL FA I.C.I22125 I.C.
