    "content": "Feature\n23 June 1993 Felix 971\nAlbert's undercover\nDeclan Curry peeks under the covers to find something rotten in the state\nof heritage, and thinks about adopting an angel\nIn the winter of 1989, a strange\nobject began to appear in South\nKensington. A large edifice,\nresembling a grain silo, manifested\nitself, right on the edge of Hyde\nPark, spoiling the skyline and\ndisturbing surrounding nature. This\nmonstrosity was not left by aliens,\nbut by a strange creature. The\nBaroness Blatch, Emily, to her\nfriends, stood and watched as the\ncurious carbuncle took form. The\nstructure would perform no visible\nuseful function, but would consume\nvast quantities of cash, and become\nthe area's biggest eyesore. It now\nthreatens to become the\nGovernment's millennium gift to\nSouth Kensington.\nIt was not always thus. Until that\nwinter, a beautiful and picturesque\nmonument resided on the spot. It\nwas a monument to science, to\ntechnology, to art and music. It was\ndedicated to the power of\nknowledge, and the civil ising effects of global cooperation. It is\nthe Albert Memorial, built for the\nprincely sum of \u00a3137,000, now\nincarcerated at an annual cost of\n\u00a3250,000, completely hidden from\nview.\nThe Albert Memorial was built\non the site of the 1851 Great\nExhibition, as is imperial College.\nThe Exhibition was Britain's showcase to the world, proudly\ndisplaying her wealth of culture and\nlearning. Yet, at this same\nExhibition, the Royal\nCommissioners noticed the growing\nstrength of European scholarship,\nand the waning of Britain's influence in science and technology.\nSuch influence was of interest to the\nMonarchy. Following the 1851\nExhibition, Queen Victoria told\nParliament that 'the advancement of\npractical science will be readily\nrecognised as worthy of attention'.\n'Her interest was shared by the\nPrince Consort, Albert, who, in\n1845, founded the Royal College of\nChemistry, becoming its first\nPresident and personally inviting\nthe great Hoffmann to London as its\nfirst professor. In 1872, the Royal\nCollege of Chemistry began its\nprotracted move to South\nKensington, onto land acquired\nfrom those same Royal\nCommissioners for the 1851\nExhibition. The final emergence of\nspecialised science and technology\neducation did not emerge until\n1907, with the formation of\nImperial College, and the award of\nits Royal Charter. The 1851\nCommissioners still have an office\nat Imperial; their representative on\nearth cur rend y resides on the fourth\nfloor of the Sherfield building.\nAlbert's interest in science is\ndisplayed in the memorial,\nconstructed and dedicated to him\nafter his death of typhoid in 1861.\nTwo bronze life-size figures stand\non either side of the Prince Consort,\nrepresenting science. His interests\nin art is displayed in the mosaic\ngables above the main statue, and\n169 artists, writers, musicians,\nsculptors and architects are depicted\nin the marble frieze around the base\nof the Memorial. The fourteen foot\nhigh statue of Albert has a catalogue\nof the Great Exhibition perched on\nhis knee. London property\nspecialist, Mira Bar-Hillel, says that\nthe Memorial 'is a monument to\nboth Albert and the exhibition ers. He's more than a pretty face.'\nNot that any of this can be seen.\nStudents from Imperial, concert-goers from the Royal Albert Hall,\ntourists in Hyde Park, Londoners\non the number 9 bus can only\nmarvel at the Skylab-like\nscaffolding now encapsulating the\nMemorial. The 165 feet high\nstructure has itself entered the\nGuinness Book of Records, as the\nlargest piece of free-standing\nscaffolding in the world. This\nglobal feat may itself have caused\na small, ironic smile to cross the\nRoyal lips. After all, it was his wife\nwho was never amused.\nThe green, red, blue and white\nhulking beast that so dominates\nWest London was constructed to\nallow emergency and essential\nrepairs to the monument. Hush, did\nI hear a hammer blow against lead,\nthe whistle of skilled craftsmen?\nHardly likely. The scaffold started\nto go up in 1989, the Department\nof National Heritage decided in\nOctober 1992 to press on with a \u00a310\nmillion repair package, and a month\nlater the terrible twins duo of\nNorman Lamont and Michael\nPortillo stopped the money.\nHeritage Secretary Peter Brooke\ntold MPs that he had to postpone the\nstart of the repair programme\nbecause 'of the many demands on\npublic resources at a time of very\ntight public expenditure control'.\nThe only work that has been done\nis by the various consultants,\nAlbert, Angus and someone else.\nPage 10\n\n"

A new survey\ncommissioned for the Department\nof Employment shows that more\nemployers are plumping for\napplicants with vocational\nqualifications over those with a degree.\nThe Institute of Manpower\nStudies, which carried out the poll,\nsaid there has been a shift towards\nthe selective recruitment of fewer,\nbetter qualified and older\napplicants. Clare Simpkin, an\nemployment journalist, says that a combination of recession and\ndemographic changes has killed off\ntraditional patterns of mass\nrecruitment.\nMeanwhile, new figures have\nbeen published concurring with\nearlier fears that graduate\nemployment prospects are\nplummeting. Graduate vacancies in\nchartered accountancy were down\na quarter last year, and experts are\npredicting a tougher time this year.\nRoger Hammett, of Southampton\nUniversity's careers service, says\n'every sector has been affected by\nfalling vacancies'. Neil Harris, of\nLondon University careers service\nsaid they were expecting 100 firms\nto attend July's London\nRecruitment Fair. This is just half\nthe number which attended in 1989.\n'The financial sector is very dull,'\nadded Dr Harris.\nEngineers exhibiting\nby Declan Curry\nA major exhibition was hosted by\nthe Royal Academy of Engineering\non Queen's Lawn yesterday. The\nso i ree, an annual event which\nmoves from institution to\ninstitution, was organised this year\nby Professor Patrick Dowling,\nHead of Civil Engineering, and\nProfessor Jack Chapman, a visiting\nprofessor.\nThe so i ree will include\nexhibitions on the theme of the\ncontribution of engineering to the\nnation's wealth. Professor Dowling\ntold Felix that this wealth was not\njust material, but also included\nenvironmental and other\ncontributions to the quality of life.\nA committee of 'eminent persons'\nhas selected 35 exhibits to show\nhow technical innovation moves\nfrom the workbench to the\nmarketplace.\nOne of the seven exhibits from\nImperial shows a new artificial knee\njoint for use in medicine. The joint,\nwhich replaces non- generating\nligaments at the back of the knee\ncap, comprises thousands of\nfilaments bolted together between\nthe femur and the tibia. The joint\ncan take stress up to half a ton.\nOther exhibits include a Dundee\ninvention which detects bank note\nforgeries by using spectral analysis,\nand a device from Hertfordshire\nwhich detects Legionnaire disease-causing particles, a task described\nas finding six needles in Wembley\nstadium.\nProfessor Dowling says that\nengineering is working hand in\nhand with industry, but accepts\nthere are problems with the\nmarketing of innovations. Speaking\non LBC Newstalk, the Professor\nsaid this was due to boardrooms\nbeing crammed with technical\nilliterates, and engineers being 'too\nnarrowly educated' so that they do\nnot have finance and\ncommunication skills.\nThe problematic shortfall in the\nnumbers of engineering students has\nreceived government attention this\nweek. Incentive awards of \u00a3500\nhave been announced to tempt high\ncalibre students to opt for\nengineering degrees. The scheme,\nadministered by the Engineering\nCouncil, will provide funds for two\nthousand students, and will run for\nthree years, starting next\nSeptember. In announcing the\nscheme, the Education Secretary,\nJohn Patten, urged employers to\nalert students to the 'increasingly\ncompetitive starting salaries for\nengineering graduates,' which\ncurrently stand at \u00a312,800 per\nannum. Denis Filer, director\ngeneral of the/Engineering Council,\nsaid the bursa ries would attract\n'people much needed by the\nindustry'. The bursa ries have also\nbeen welcomed by the Science\nMinister, William Waldegrave.\n'This reflects the spirit of the\nscience and engineering white paper\nand the importance government\nattaches to engineering. It's just\nwhat the profession wanted.'\nRag have unveiled their new slogan for next year, writes Declan Curr\nThe burnt offering is above; all you have to do is to colour it in like\ngood six year old, and send it off to Womble, c/o the Rag Office.

The verdict on\nchemists was delivered by hundreds\nof teenagers studying the subject.\nThe denouncement was made in a survey for the Royal Society of\nChemistry, which was trying to\nattract more youngsters into the\n'Temple Challenge Club'. The\ncompetition, for colleges and non-collegiate universities, was won by\nImperial last year. A new team has\nbeen formed to try and hold the\ntitle.\nprofession. For good measure, the\n13-18 year olds also described\nchemists as 'swot s', 'wimps',\n'loners', and 'male'. Dr Sepp\nGruber, of the Royal Society, said\nthe results showed that 'the message\nis not getting through that chemists\nmake a major contribution to the\nnational economy and improving\nthe environment and social\nconditions.'\nRubbish\nby Declan Curry\nEstates has announced that it is to\ntake trash seriously, with the\nappointment of a new Waste\nControl Officer. Bob Birrell,\nformerly Technical Services\nManager at Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering, will coordinate the introduction of a new\n'Waste Disposal Policy'. The policy\nwill be influenced by the 1990\nEnvironmental Protection Act,\nwhich places a 'duty of care' on\nthose involved in the disposal of\nhousehold, industrial and trade\nwaste.\nIn other staff changes, Clare\nDaunton has resigned as\nDevelopment Officer, to take up a new job with Shelter.

    "content": "Felix 971\neat ure23 June 1993\nsnowdrops\nwriting reports on how to restore\nthe Memorial, and by those ever-pleasant private secretaries, drafting-Commons written answers assuring\nall that 'the Government remains\ncommitted to a worthy restoration\nof the Albert Memorial.' The\npresent situation, claims Ms BarHillel, is that 'if someone took him\naway in the dead of night no-one\nwould notice for years.'\nMr Brooke is allowed some\nembarrassment on the matter. His\nis the Memorial's MP, being the\nmember for the City of London and\nWestminster South. To intervene\nwould be seen as privileged action\nputting constituency matters above\nnational priorities. To stand idle is\nto neglect a monument of national\nimportance, and to ignore pressing\nmatters in his own backyard. If only\nPrince Albert were Asil Nadir: then\nother MPs could 'make\nrepresentations' to Mr Brooke, and\nhis former junior, Michael Mates,\ncould present it with a new watch\n(don't let the builders grind you\ndown?), driving up in his borrowed\nVolvo, of course. Mr Brooke is\nunderstandably taciturn on the\nstatue, refusing to be bounced by\nLBC Newstalk into talking about\nthe matter, and incident ly allowing\nhis private office to tell LBC that\nhe doesn't really want to be\ninterviewed by Mike Carlton in\nfuture. Responsibility has been\ndelegated to the newly enthroned\nIain Sproat, the MP for Harwich.\nAs he's new to the job, Mr Sproat\ncould always go back and look\nagain at the options. There's plenty\nto choose from. The first report on\nthe Monument was published in\n1986, saying that the wrought iron\nspire cross beams supporting the\nspire were brittle, and could fall\ndown within five years. This they\nconspicuously failed to do in the\nGreat Storm the following year.\nBack came the engineers in 1988,\nsaying that the deterioration was not\nso bad after all, and the iron was\nbrittle all along. A third report\nappeared on ministerial desks in\nMay 1989, after which the scaffold\nstarted climbing up the Memorial.\nThe round robin dropped off its\nperch in October last year, when the\nDepartment for National Heritage\nwas presented with three options.\nTrue to form, the Department asked\nfor a hiding by choosing the \u00a310\nmillion option, a total overhaul\nlasting four years. The plan lasted\nfour weeks before the Treasury\nmoved in.\nHeritage experts claim that the\nMemorial can be restored to public\nview for a tenth of the figure. Dr\nRichard Catt, the Special\nConservation Consultant to the\nLord Chancellor's Office, cares for\nall listed courthouses on the NorthEast circuit, and now specialises in\nconservation in the old\nCzechoslovakia. He says that, at\nlittle cost, the main part of the\nMemorial could be returned to\npublic view by this Friday. Dr Catt\nadds that, after this, the bulk of the\nrepairs could start by removing all\nthe statues and decorations above\nthe Memorial's canopy, and peeling\noff their lead coverings. The iron\ncan be scraped of rust, and given\nan anti-corrosion treatment. The\ndecorations can be kept safe until\nthey are repaired, and the\nscaffolding sold.\nThis basic plan, commissioned by\nthe Evening Standard, has been\nadopted as a restoration blueprint by\nthe Victorian Society. Their\nchairman, Dr Chris Brooks, says\nthe Government should be more\nflexible on the repairs. 'The\nGovernment needs to be far more\ninventive in seeking funding from\nthe general public and the private\nsector. The restoration is urgent and\nshould be announced as a priority\nconservation project.' One\nsuggestion is start an 'adopt-an-angel' scheme; another is to apply\nfor a National Lottery grant. The\nDepartment for National Heritage\nis 'considering the proposals', while\nWestminster City Council may\ninclude Albert in its Millennium\nInitiative.\nGiven the indefinite\npostponement of the repairs by the\nHeritage Secretary, the Memorial\nmay not be uncovered for the\nMillennium. It may also be\nshackled the following year, the\n150th anniversary of the 1851 Great\nExhibition. The Albert Memorial\nmay become a memorial to the state\nof British heritage, and British\nscience.\n3 February The IRA terrorist war continues, with a bomb at South Kensington tube station.\n5 February The Great Rag Bash disco takes place, run\nnot by Andy Kerr's Ents, but by Imperial Discos.\nGovernment official figures in Social Trends show\nthat the student grant is worth only 4 0 % of its 1980\nvalue.\n8 February The Holbein common room crisis\nappears to be solved, with the unveiling of four new\nEvelyn Gardens common rooms, to replace existing\nfacilities.\nChris Davidson announces plans to develop the\nSherfield walkway. The Junior Common Room is to\nbe reduced in size, and new trading outlets placed\nin the alcoves. Mr Davidson said the changes should\ntake place over the summer.\n12 February The opening of the Sports Centre is\ndelayed once again. The total delay now weighs in\nat six weeks.\n16 February The Government's response to the\nTomlinson Report is unveiled by Health Secretary\nVirginia Bottomley. She said there was no financial\ncase for relocating the Marsden and Brompton\nhospitals, and proposed the creation of a new\nChelsea Health Sciences Centre. The rest of the\nreport was kicked into touch, with the creation of six\nspeciality reviews. Imminent cabinet reshuffle, what\nimminent cabinet reshuffle?\n17 February Science minister William Waldegrave\npays a private visit to IC.\n18 February Felix is leaked the details of John Patten's proposed students' charter. Local education\nauthorities were to be stripped of their grant giving\npowers, and a new unitary grant and loan authority\ncreated. Funding for student unions would also be split\ninto core and non- core spending. All the money would\nbe gobbled up by the core funding, and clubs and\nsocieties, classified as non-core, would have to levy\nsteep membership fees.

He\nreally did pick his time to leave,\nfleeing before the forces of light and\nyouth.\nHe also chose well in the\norganisations he joined, though to\nbe fair he was probably appointed\nto them, and as the model civil\nservant he didn't demur as he is not\nsupposed to have more than an\nounce of wit. Aside from being\nChief Scientific Adviser to the\nMinistry for Iraqi Superguns and\nmustard gas (Kurdish use only), he\nwas Chairman of the Royal Society\nWorking Party on the Support of\nGeophysics, which was about as\nmuch support as a rubber crutch.\nLater, in succession, he was a member of the Science and\nEngineering Research Council,\nSERC (killed off in the White\nPaper), the Advisory Board for the\nResearch Council, ABRC (similarly\ndeceased), and the Advisory\nCouncil for Science and\nTechnology, ACOST (RIP 1993).\nThe kiss of death, eh? He takes over\nhere in September.\nAnd here's the juicy bit. Why\nwas he appointed Rector? Felix is\nassured that there was definitely no\nconnection between Sir Ron, the\nChief Scientific Advisor at the\nMinistry of Defence, and Sir Frank\nCooper, the Governing Body\nchairman, himself a former\nPermanent Secretary at the MOD, the post now held by Oxburgh's current boss, Sir Christopher\nFrance. After all, Sir Ron didn't become full-time CSA until October\n1988, while Sir Frank was elected\nGoverning Body chairman in, er,\nOctober 1988, but had been a Governing Body member for many\nyears beforehand. We assume that\nthe new Rector, appointed by the\nGoverning Body, was really the\nbest man for the job.\nNot that this was his first contact\nwith the College. In 1986/7, the\nthen Professor Ron was chairman\nof the University Grants Committee\nReview of Earth Sciences. This was\nthe committee that finally\nrecommended, e rh mph, shall we\nsay radical changes in the Royal\nSchool of Mines. The 1988 Annual\nReport from the then Dean of the\nRSM was noted for its abusive\ncomments towards the Committee.\nThe College press office tells us that\nSir Ron was not involved with the\nreview in the context of a hands-on\ninter l ocular interactive interfacing\nsupervisory role. But, in the year\nthat Sir Ron takes over here,\nProfessor John Archer, the current\npro-Rector and Head of Mineral\nResources Engineering, has\nproposed another 'downsizing' of\nthe School. Lo and behold, John\nArcher is also acting Rector for the\nmonth of August. Sir Eric Ash\nretires at the end of July, and Sir\nRon takes over on 1 September.

Teams of 4 to 6 people\nhad to visit the locations on the\nMonopoly board,answering clues\nand collecting treasure on the way.\nAltogether \u00a34660 was collected in\naid of Mencap and the top collectors\nwon bottles of wine. The prizes\nwere given out at the party\norganised by Mencap that evening.\nAs the term continued so did the\nfun not to mention the fundraising.\nOn the third Saturday of term a total\nof \u00a3973 was raised, for the Royal\nAssociation In Aid of Deaf People,\non the 'Pavement Climb' from the\nVictoria and Albert museum to\nHyde Park. That very same day saw\nthe Union being invaded by students\nin various states of undress - yes,\nit was the night of the Rocky Horror\nDisco.\nNovember was then upon us and\nwith it came the Poppy Day Rag\nRaid to Maidstone. This, despite the\ncold weather, was a success . The\nfirst week also saw the Battersea\nFireworks collection which raised\nloads a money for one of our local\ncharities.\nBy now many collectors had\nmanaged to raise \u00a350 in order to get\ntheir incentive mug if not \u00a3150 for\ntheir T shirt.\nThe two highlights of the month\nhave to have been the Sponsored\nBungee Jump and the Halls Dirty\nDozen competition. The former had\nmany crazy people throwing\nthemselves off the top of a crane,\nin order to experience the high of\na lifetime. Marcus did the jump in\nhis wheelchair and thus became\nonly the second person in Britain to\ndo this. The event raised a total of\n\u00a33000. The latter event took place\non the 14th November and involved\neach hall sending out a team of 12\n(or thereabouts) to collect as much\nmoney as possible in 12 hours. That\nday London saw some strange\nsights as teams were doing\neverything from dressing up as St\nTrinians' pupils (blok es included)\nto singing songs from 'Grease' in\nCovent Garden in order to get the\npublic to part with their money. A couple of teams actually ventured\nfurther afield to nearby towns such\nas Guildford. The winners of the\ncompetition were Falmouth-Keogh\nwho gained a barrel of beer for their\nefforts. The first term came to an\nend with the C CU Covent Garden\ncollections, the winners of which\nthe were the RCS.\nThis year Rag Week was saved\nfor the second term and kicked off\non January 29th with the Rag\nCarnival at the Union. The week\ncontinued with Rag Rugby, Mines\nDirty Disco, Guilds Slave Auction\nand the famous Beer Festival with\nthe launch of this years Rag Mag.\nThe Hypnosis show provided\nThursday's entertainment and\nhundreds of people turned up to see\ntheir friends make acquaint a in ces with an elephant on stage and dance\nto 'Singing in the Rain' on cue. The\nfestivities ended with the Rag Bash\nfollowed by the infamous\nSponsored Nude Kamakazi\nParachute Jump from Harrods.\nAfter all that excitement the rest of\nterm continued relatively quietly.\nThis term, in case anybody\nmissed it, the main event was Rag\nFete held on the Queens Lawn on\nMay 12th. From 2pm onwards\nmany a student relived their\nchildhood by jumping around on the\nbouncy castle or taking part in the\n'Cocktail Dash' and the numerous\n'Jelly Dips' with music from Jazz\nand Rock society and IC Radio. By\n5pm most of the jelly had\ndisappeared so we then had to get\ndown to the serious business of\npresenting cheques to the charities\nthat had been nominated for this\nyear. The money for these came\nfrom Rag Week events, Rag\ncloakroom and money from T shirt\nand Rag Mag sales. The charities\nthe cheques went to were Turning\nPoint, FARA, ARMS, Shelter, and\nlocal charities.\nI think that just about sums the\nRag year up, except to say that we\nstill have events going on this year.\nWe especially need volunteers to\ncollect at the Royal Albert Hall, at\nthe Victoria Wood and the Johnny\nMathis concerts in September. For\nmore details see the Rag\nnoticeboard or come up to the Rag\nOffice.\nFinally, thanks to everyone who\nhas helped Rag this year and we\nlook forward to seeing you next\nyear when Ragis aiming to be even\nbigger. Don't miss out.\nThe last word\nFelix 971 23 June 1993\nsleigh bells1 December Emergency Christmas repairs are made\nto the Imperial College Union fire alarm system when\nit is discovered that fire escape doors stay locked\nwhen the alarms go off.

OK, so I dish it out\nas well on occasions, but that's what\nI 've been here for. I am only a student with an opinion. Is it my\nfault that most of the fucking\ncollege is too apathetic to write\nanything for Felix? Many people\nhave been quick to attack, but have\nthey got the dedication to write 600\nwords a week, every week? Only\nif you answered 'yes' to the\nprevious question, can you be\nworthy to have had a go at me.\nOtherwise, kindly shut the fuck up\nin future. Oh, that also applies to\nany other aspect of Felix. If you are\nnot happy with anything, come in\nnext year, if you are still here, and\nas Donny said 'fucking do better.'\nThe doors are always open.\nThe following list of persons is\nanyone, and I mean anyone, who\nhas personally gi u en me more\nhassle than I deserve. They may\ncontribute to Felix in some way,\nthat I am not criticising. I am\nattacking them directly.

To write\nwhatever you like for any\npublication, has been and is great\nfun. Total freedom (within a few\nlimits) is the key.

    "content": "'eat ure23 June 1993 Felix 971\nLondon's falling to pieces\nSince the beginning of this year the future of the University of London has\nbeen in doubt. Andrew Tseng investigates what could happen next.\nIf Imperial did d is affiliate from\nthe University of London then\nstudents would almost certainly lose\nout. The vast facilities of the\nUniversity of London Union\n(ULU), which include its great\nmultitude of clubs and societies,\nwould no longer be available.\nNeither would the University of\nLondon Library. Accomodation\nwould also be in jeopardy.\nAccording to the Rector, Imperial,\nHence in November 1992 a body\nknown as the Charter Review\ncommittee was set up. Sitting\ntherein were members of Imperial\nCollege's Governing body and the\nsingle student representative, Chris\nDavidson, then Imperial College\nStudents' Union President. Their\nremit was to examine all the\nproblems the Rector had identified\nand come up with solutions.\nOn October 22nd1992, Commemoration Day, Sir Eric\nAsh, the Rector of Imperial\nCollege, dropped a bombshell on\nthe academic community of\nLondon. His speech on that warm\nautumn afternoon included these\nfateful words, 'we have resolved to\nembark on a review...to examine\nthe possibility of a separation from\nthe University of London'.\nThis single declaration has led\nUniversity College and the London\nSchool of Economics to make\nsimilar statements. The London\nSchool of Economics has gone\nfurther. To The Independent, a press spokesman for the London\nSchool of Economics said, 'it is not\na question of if, but when'.\nThere are two imp or ant issues\nwhich the Rector believes must be\nsettled, the right to award degrees\nand the right to appoint senior\nacademic staff, T believe that the\nRector of Imperial College should\nhave the same powers as the Vice\nChancellor of the University of\nSouth Bank' he says. The resolving\nof the first issue would allow\nImperial to introduce new courses\nquickly, without the intervention of\nthe University of London, a process\nthat has caused considerable delay\nin the past. The second of these\nissues was highlighted recently\nwhen a three month delay, by the\nThe University of London Library\nUniversity of London, almost lost\nImperial the prime candidate for a professorship.\nalong with University College and\nthe London School of Economics,\nmust own a share in the\nIntercollegiate Halls of Residence,\na fact which has been disputed by\nothers in the University of London.\nThese options have been set down\nin writing by Professor Stewart\nSutherland, the Vice-Cbancellor of\nthe University of London. In his\npaper entitled, 'The University of\nLondon and the Award of Degrees',\nProfessor Sutherland outlines the\npossible two options B and C( Option A being to leave everything\nas it stands at the moment).\nOption B describes, the\npossibility of the big eight schools\n(Birkbeck College, Goldsmiths\nCollege, Imperial College, Kings\nCollege, London School of\nEconomics, Queen Mary Westfield\nCollege, Royal Holloway College\n(formerly the Royal Holloway and\nBedford New College) and\nUniversity College) d is affiliating from the University of London.\nProfessor Sutherland discusses what\nhe believes the consequences of\nd is affiliation would be. The\noverwhelming advantage for\nImperial College, is that\nd is affiliation would solve both the\nproblems outlined by Sir Eric Ash.\nAs far as the University of\nLondon is concerned, Professor\nSutherland believes that Option B has some major disadvantages. One\nof which being that the Constitution\nof the University of London would\nhave to be changed. This would\nrequire much time and effort which\ncould be better used elsewhere.\nProfessor Sutherland also predicts\nthat any 'withdrawal would\ninevitably be a messy business,\npossibly involving bitter and\nen nerva ting argument'.\nFortunately for students and for\nthe University of London there\ncould be another solution to\nImperial's problems that would\ncause less turmoil.

Declan Curry tries his hands at a profile,\nusing the old tricks of research, thefts, bribes, and scrounging expensive\nlunches from his news editor.\nOxburgh? He's Ministry of\nDefence, isn't he? Oh well, nothing\nfor it but the Whitehall Companion,\nthe Government watchers' bible.\nLet's see, M, N,P, no back a bit,\nO,O, Owen John, Owen Peter,\nhmmm.... no Ron Oxburgh. Hold\non, OX BURGH, Professor Sir\nERNEST. Ernest? Is this the same\nman? ERNEST RONALD. Yep,\nmust be.\nIt is a touch bizarre. The in-house\nbible, the Who's Who of Whitehall,\nwhere status symbols abound, and\nour very own Sir Ron gets a cursory\nmention at the bottom of a page, in\na different name, and look, no\nphotograph, one of the very few\nentries without one. Then again, a man who is the Chief Scientific\nAdviser at the MOD, and grade 1A to boot, probably doesn't need\nmuch in the line of a status figure.\nHe does seem to be a bit of a mystery, though. Granted there is\nthe old proviso that MOD senior\nstaff have meagre entries (Official\nSecrets and all that), but this one\nreally is bare.\n'Career: professor of mineralogy\nand petrology, University of\nCambridge 1978-; chief scientific\nadviser MOD1988;' What, is he only fifteen years\nold? No, he was born on 2\nNovember 1934, so he's sixty next\nyear. Unemployed? Imprisoned?\nMost definitely not Chief\nScientific Advisor, Ministry of\nDefence, CSA, MOD. It's like a mantra. He's probably seen my\nMI5 files as well.\nNo doubt they were checked\nanyway when my boss, Mr Tseng,\nbounced the first request for an\ninterview off the desk of John\nCryer, Oxburgh'sPA at the\nMinistry.\n'An interview, eh? What for?'\n'Well, to talk to him....'\nAnd so on. Request passed to\nanother, then back, then to a secretary, then to .Oxburgh, and\nthat's just to get an agreement in\nprinciple. Life's too short. Let's hope next year he'll be more\naccommodating, otherwise it will\nbe too much to stomach the usual\nRectorial w hinge that we never\ncheck our facts with the people who\nknow ('but never want to tell' being\nthe s otto voce response).\nMaybe this level of cos setting comes with the job. Sir Ron appears\nin the chart called 'higher\norganisation of Defence'.\nTheoretically, the ministers are\nresponsible for the department, with\nthe civil servants providing a supporting role. Right. Malcolm\nRifkind is Defence Secretary. He\ncouldn't run a message. The junior\nministers are Archie Hamilton,\nfrom the East Anglia mafia, busy\nkeeping John Major's political\nprospects alive; Jonathan Aitken,\npaying more than usual interest to\nthe Scott inquiry into Arms for Iraq;\nand some viscount or other. That's that strong ministerial team tied up.\nLooking at the power brokers, the\nchief civil servant is Sir Christopher\nFrance, vaguely remembered as\nbeing a smash hit in the same job\nin Health and Social Security. And\nthen under him is Professor Sir ER Oxburgh. Well spotted, number\ntwo at the MOD. The line of\ncommand runs from Sir\nChristopher France, to Sir Ron\nOxburgh, then to his deputy and\nseven other scientists. Now that's real power, and scientific clout. It's a long time since the Sherfield Set\nhave had a strong hands on manager\ncapable of smacking wrists. No\nwonder they're grumbling. Mr Fraser is allegedly not amused, and\nas for Mr Marshall, he's leaving\nanyway, contract un renewed we are\ntold. Gordon's got a case of the\nWestermans, bad luck.\nSo what has the boy wonder done\nall these years? Building a strong\nacademic background, it seems,\nthough there must be something\ngood about an academic who's had\npart of his research funded by the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences. A native Scouser, born and bred etc,\neducated for eleven years from the\nage of seven at the Liverpool\nInstitute, which was always thought\nof as a sweeping description of\nMerseyside anyway, or was that\ninstitution? To Oxford in 1953,\nemerging blinking into the sunlight\nfour years later with an honours\nPage 14\n\n"

That is until\nyou live there and realise what poor\nmanagement and planning can do.\nFirst, there are a disproportionate\nnumber of freezers to refrigerators.\nIn our kitchen alone we have three\nempty freezers to two over-packed\nrefrigerators for six people. This is\nuseless. Our refrigerators have to\nbe taken to put in House 63 because\nsomeone ordered too many\nfreezers. There is also only one\noven per 24 people, which greatly\nreduces the use of frozen food.\nSecond: kettles and toasters were\nstolen earlier in the year (because\nthe front door wouldn't lock) and\nit took over three months to get\nthem replaced. Third and most\nimportant: There are no locks for\nour refrigerators, freezers, or\ncupboards even though the holes\nhave already been drilled. Our\nsub wardens have been phoning Mr G Daniels, residence area manager,\nsince January and have been\nconsistently told that the situation\nwould be dealt with soon. Then they\nwere told that no locks of the\ncorrect size were available, but the\nmore recently finished House 62\nbasement kitchen and all of House\n63 did get locks. But the catch is\nthat there is only one key per\nrefrigerator and 2-3 people to use\nit. Effectively they can't lock\nanything either.\nThis has led to the inevitable.\nFood has been stolen from every\nkitchen, and consistently from our\nkitchen. If locks were in place we\nwould be able to tell who the thief\nis, and that would probably prevent\nthe crime in the first place. As it\nstands, we would like to be\ncompensated, as with any loss of\nproperty in Halls. Thefts which\nhave been reported to the\nsub warden would be considered\nvalid for recompense. Of course\nthis couldn't come from the\ninsurance company - they'd never\npay since it's the management's negligence Which has caused the\nsituation. Maybe the money could\ncome from the amenities fees we've\nbeen paying for a television room\nand newspapers which have never\nmaterialise d! sincerely,\nMartin Gallagher, Krista Kasdorf,\nGantam Kapoor, Bharti Reddy, S Agarwal, T Yasin, Alick Sethi,\nNadeem Siddyn, Ant Vohra.\nPlay the opinion game!\nDear Jonty,\nOf late I have discovered a new\ngame. It's called 'What are your\nviews on the reform of the union\nstructure?'. Hardly a snappy name,\nbut it seems to describe the game\nquite well. This is what you do:\n1. Strike up a conversation with\nsomeone in the Union Building. It\nhelps if you know them, but this is\nnot necessary.\n2. Introduce the topic of union\nreform with something approaching\nthe subtlety of a sledgehammer.\n3. Listen to the flow of polarised,\ngenerally uninformed views that\nreturns.\n4. Make agreeing noises\nUnfortunately I'm starting'to get\nbored with the pretty universal\nresponses; that it's not very good,\nthat this has been sprung on us at\nsuch short notice. I agree, but I get\nthe feeling that these people are\ngoing to vote against the reforms\nsolely that they were not consulted\nearlier.\nYes, it would have been nice to\nhave been involved as a voting\nmember of ICU, but we weren't and that is now in the past.\nAnybody that has seen the\nconstitution as it stands will agree\nthat it needs a rewrite. So give a little time; go to the AGM on Friday\n(l pm JCR) and go through the\nconstitution point by point.\nIt's the document that's important, not the people and the\npolitics that surround it. The\nconstitution will be around for about\na decade; the people are just passing\nthrough.\nYours,\nStef Smith, Physics III\nMany thanks to all those who\nhave contributed to the Opinion\npages this year. It has given me\nthe greatest of pleasure to read all\nyour insults, incoherence and\nrage. May the fury continue\nuna baited until there are no more\nFelicies.\nParticular recognition must go\nto James Crisp for drawing the\ncartoons that have enlivened the\npages. I hope Gary Larsen\ndoesn't sue.\nWhile I am in the process of\nthanks let me mention Stef Smith,\nthink tank scuba diver\nextra ordinaire, may his credits be\nas long as his reputation. Final\nthank you, and this really is the\nlast one luv vies, to Ian and\nYvonne for keeping me fed this\nyear. Although this once wai fish editor has become rather plumper\nbecause of it!\nEnts revenge\nDear Jonty\nJust a quick reflective note on the\npast year in Ents. This year has seen\na booming Ents programme, with\nan extremely varied set of events\nand most of these events being sold\nout or very close to sold out. With\nsuch success one would be forgiven\nin thinking that we have had great\nsupport from Union Staff and\nSabbaticals. Wrong!\nDuring this year, Ents have been\ndrawn into pointless games of petty\npolitics by members of the Union.\nAt every juncture we have been\nopposed and we had to fight very\nhard to prevent ourselves being\ndragged under by swollen egos.\nSome of the sabbaticals and\nmember(s) of staff have been under\nthe impression that, with their\n(very) limited and in some cases\nnon-existent skills in event\norganisation, they should dictate\nterms and conditions under which\nevents are to be run. I seems that\nthe many year's experience of the\nEnts committee count for nothing in\nevent management. Those who\nknow nothing, should leave the\ndecisions to be made by people with\nthe relevant experience; ie the Ents\nCommittee.\nAt this stage I would like to make\nclear that we are very appreciative\nof the students and staff who have\nprovided continual support. We\nleave this year, proud of the\nachievements and successes of Ents,\nbut jaded by the experience of\nworking within Imperial College\nUnion. Unfair, untrue and unkind\naccusations have been levelled at\nthe ents committee by members of\nstaff this year. We are upset that no\napologies have been made and the\nwhole experience has left a sour\ntaste in our mouths.\nOn a lighter note, we would like\nto thank everyone in the Ents\nCommittee for giving up so much\ntime to ensure you the punters have\nthe cheapest top-quality student\nentertainment in London. You owe\nthem a lot. Thanks go to Michelle,\nCathy, Zona, Louise, Felix,\nDramSoc (particularly the truly\namazing Andrew Nu), Ian,\nYvonne, Andy F. and Dom.\nThe Ents Exec\nAndy Kerr (Ents Chair 92/93)\nB.J.( Ents Hon Sec 92/93)\nLisa (Treasurer 93/93)\nPage 4\n\n"

Press reports suggest\nthat nine London hospitals could\nshut, and St Mary's Hospital in\nPaddington, indirectly part of\nImperial College, is one of another\nfour hospitals fighting for survival.\nThe speciality review groups\nwere set up as part of the\nGovernment's response to the\nreport from the Tomlinson Inquiry.\nThe groups examined the provision\nof heart, cancer, pae di at ric, neuroscience, renal and plastic\nsurgery services in London. This\nmorning's report is expected to\nslash these key services. Labour has\ndescribed the plans as 'sheer\nvandalism'.\nThe hospitals threatened with\nclosure are Royal Marsden\nHospital, Chelsea; St Thomas'\nHospital, Central London; St\nBartholomew's Hospital; Harefield\nHospital; The London Chest\nHospital; Queen Elizabeth Hospital\nfor Children, Hackney; Brook\nHospital, Greenwich; Oldchurch\nHospital, Romford; and Atkinson\nMorley Hospital. Health pressure\ngroup London Health Emergency\n(LHE) says a subsequent financial\ncrisis will lead to the possible\nclosure for a tenth hospital, Queen\nMary's Hospital, in Roehampton.\nAccording to L HE, the\nrational is ation of the speciality\nservices will leave four other\nhospitals fighting for survival. St\nMary's in Paddington is expected\nto lose its esteemed cancer unit and\nalmost all of its renal services\nimmediately, with its cardiac\nservice to be axed within a few\nyears. Britain's first mobile cardiac\nunit was launched by Health\nSecretary Virginia Bottomley at St\nMary's during April, and Mrs\nBottomley also said last February\nthat St Mary's 'was well sited in\nrelation to the population'. Peter\nRichards, Dean of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, is making\nno comment on the reports, but\nsenior adr run is tr at or s at the Medical\nSchool say they could 'go under' if\nSt Mary's Hospital closed or was\ndownsized. The three others are\nKing's College Hospital, the Royal\nFree, and the Maudsley.\nAny change to St Mary's Medical\nSchool would demolish plans for an\nexpansion of the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine, and wreck the\nHealth Secretary's own proposals\nfor a new 'Chelsea Health Sciences\nCentre'. The four other components\nof both plans are now facing\npossible closure or ravaging of\nexisting services. The Royal\nMarsden is reportedly facing\nimmediate closure (Felix 966), and\nthe Royal Brompton may merge\nwith the new Westminster and\nChelsea Hospital, flatly\nThe new Leopold Muller Cystic Fibrosis Gene Research Laboratory w opened by HRH Princess Alexandra this week. The laboratory house\nfirst British research programme connecting genetic technology a use of gene therapy to treat cystic fibrosis. The project is funded thro\na grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. HRH was greeted by 15 year ol\nKate Law, who has cystic fibrosis.\ncontradicting Mrs Bottomley's encouragement to both hospitals to\nsubmit a joint trust application. As\nreported in Felix 970, the\nHammersmith Hospital is expected\nto lose its cardiac service, along\nwith its pae di at ric, neuroscience\nand cancer services. Celia Oakley,\na cardiac professor at the Royal\nPostgraduate Medical School, has\nalready predicted that the\nHammersmith Medical School\nwould shut if the cardiac service\nwere to close. Charing Cross\nHospital is due to lose its renal,\npae di at ric, and cancer services. Its\nplastic surgery service would stay\nat the site only if their specialist\nAccident and Emergency services\nremains there also. Health experts\nhave warned that Charing Cross\nA& E will shut if any of the\nspecialist services are lost from\nCharing Cross.\nFelix Summer Special in three\nparts!!!\n1. News 2. Reviews 3.

This would keep the\nUniversity of London title on the\ndegree certificate, but give Imperial\nthe freedom that the Rector wants\nover the creation of new courses.\nSir Eric Ash's second issue would\nalso be satisfied, since Imperial\nwould have full control over the\nappointment of senior staff with the\nUniversity of London only\nproviding a 'rubber stamping role'.\nThe Vice-Chancellor believes\nthat the University of London\nshould choose Option C. Professor\nSutherland can envisage only a couple of minor disadvantages to\nthis Option. He can see that some\nmay criticise this Option, for\nincreasing the diversity of the\nUniversity of London, though he\ncounters this by arguing that,\n'diversity is one of the great\nstrengths of the University of\nLondon'.\nThe advantages of this Option are\nall too appa rant. No major\ncons it ut ional changes need occur,\nand the problems highlighted by the\nRector are solved without the\ncustody arguments associated with\nOption B. Option C is only being offered as\na possibility to the big eight schools.\nThis has been criticised by some,\nwho have made the accusation that\nit will introduce a two-tier system\nwithin the University of London.\nGeoffrey Alderman, chairman of\nthe academic council of the\nUniversity said, 'I would rather see\nthe larger colleges leave the\nuniversity altogether than adopt a two-tier system.' Professor\nSutherland, however, has denied\nthat Option C will bring about a two-tier system.\nEither Option B or Option C must\nbe chosen. The Rector has made it\nquite clear that the problems of\nappointing senior academic staff\nand that of awarding degrees must\nbe resolved, even if leaving the\nUniversity of London was the only\nmeans of achieving this. The debate\nmust now be decided upon at the\ncourt of the University of London,\nwhether the big colleges will be\nallowed to be re positioned or\nwhether they must d is affiliate to\nachieve the powers that they seek.\nShould are positioning occur,\nthen students can only gain. All the\nfacilities of the University of\nLondon and UL U will still be open\nto them, and without the\nbureaucracy, Imperial will be in the\nprime position to react to changes\nin Europe and the United States.\nThis is just one of the issues that\nare being discussed by the Charter\nReview committee. The Rector\nwants to have a set of proposals\nregarding that and other matters on\nthe new Rector's desk when he\ncomes into office at the start of the\nnext academic year. It looks as if\nImperial College will be able to\nhave its cake and eat it.\nspring\n1 March Sabbatical election hustings at St Marys.\nAfterwards, ICU Honorary Secretary Dominic\nWilkinson said 'some Marys' students aren't fit to\nlick the shit off our shoes.'

On the\nindividual level, Imperial's Jim\nEdward's despatching and green-la ning skills (on a GT550!) came in\nhandy leading to a first place and\na trophy in that category together\nwith brave (foolhardy?) pillion\nRichard Murray. An honourable\nmention also goes to Hubert\nHinsley (IC club secretary) and\nMartin Hardaker, who stunned\neveryone with their surprisingly fast\ntimes.\nThe day was enjoyed by all the\nparticipants and hopefully the club\nwill organise a similar PUMA event\nnext year. And manage to do better.\nResults:\nGuildford Uni 489\nBradford Uni 486\nImperial College 472\nBest individual performance:\nJim Edwards (Imperial) 516\nIC AFC Year Round up\nThe first team captained by T Botzios will be remembered as the\nteam who could have done a clean\nsweep of all the trophies but, in the\nend came up with a handful of dust.\nThey started very strongly in the\nfirst half of the season with S Watson masochistic Monday night\ntraining proving to be very\neffective. Finding themselves\nleading the Premier division, easily\nthrough to the semi finals of the UL challenge cup and also through to\nthe second round of the U AU. But\ncomplacency and bad team spirit\nwere to prove insurmountable\nobstacles. The firsts found\nthemselves out of both cups and\ntrailing in second place in the\nLeague, at the end of the season.\nOverall though, a very sucessful\nseason, with the extra pleasure in\nseeing our first team having a better\nteam season that the rugby team this\nyear, after years of lurking behind\nthem.\nIC 2nd XI\nThe second team captained by I Finnerty got off to its traditionally\nbad start, getting eliminated from\nthe U AU and UL upper reserves\ncup in the 1st round. But the\naddition of D Phillips later on in the\nseason at the centre of defence\nalongside I Finnerty (Also known\nas as the Carl Lewis and Ben\nJohnson tandem) helped tighten up\nthe defence and started the 2nds on\ntheir climb to the top of the First\ndivision. This extraordinary\ncomeback did not yield the division\ntitle, due to injuries and misfortune\nat the closing stages of the\ntournament. It did give them the\ntide of Champion Reserves, the title\ngiven to the best reserve team in the\nUL league.\nIC 3rd XI\nThe third team was captained by\nthe controversial B. Willis whose\ncaptaincy was, even by Graham\nTaylor's standards, poor. Despite\nhis outstanding football abilities Ben\nmanaged to transform a team of\neleven eager players to eleven\ndisillusioned wrecks. Often playing\nwith ten men, the 3rds were kicked\nout of the two cups early on in the\nseason and plummet ted to the\nbottom of the third division. Words\nof rebuke from Ben's charismatic\nplayers, Piyush and N. Strevens put\nhim on the rig t track. With the help\nof a few illegal players, he managed\na series of impressive results which\nhelped the thirds to avoid\nrelegation.\nIC 4th XI\nThe forth s captained by R. Snell\nhad a huge task in front of them; to\nrepeat last year's performance and\nbecome divisional champions. This\nthey started to do with no problems\nwhatsoever. With their almost\nexclusively foreign team and\ncontinental style of play, they\nmanaged to extend the 4th s unbeaten run to 30 games and\nearned themselves a place in the UL Upper Reserves cup, a cup usually\ndominated by 2nd teams. Near the\nend of the season the team became\ntoo cocky, underestimating their\nopponents, resulting in a pair of\ndefeats and elimination from the\ncup semi-final helped by D. Bucles\n'Divine' hand. Angry words from\nR. Snell and D. Buckles, reminders\nof humility, helped them regain\ntheir form and cling on to become\ndivisional champions for the second\nyear running.\nIC 5th XI\nThe fifth team captained by D. McClure were by far the most\ndisappointing team of the cup this\nyear. Dave's generosity and\nkindhearted ness in giving up his\nbest players to higher teams resulted\nin a second consecutive relegation\nin two years for the 5th team,\ndespite P. Dahill's heroic efforts to\nplay in two different teams at the\nsame time. The highlight of their\nseason came in the last game of the\nseason with a120 win over their\narch rivals RSM seconds.\nIC 6th XI\nThe sixth team captained jointly\nby J. Archer and A. Karell were the\nAC Milan of IC. The two captains\nmanaged to maintain a squad of\nabout thirty players continuously\nreshuffling the side so as not to\ndisappoint anyone. With such a formidable squad they managed, to\nachieve their primary objective\nwhich was to avoid relegation and\nearn themselves a respectable mid-table position.\nPage 16\n\n"

    "content": "Miscellaneous\n23 June 1993 Felix 971\nDominic exposes his dour northern soul\n'And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain ', as dear\nold Uncle Frank, or Sid Vicious\n(isn't music the great level ler?) would have said. Hurtling towards\nthe end of my year in office (a quaint term since I spent a large\nproportion of my time not being in\nmy office) the only thing I can say\nis 'Can I breathe out now ?'\nAnd so in summary\nEnts and ting.\nHaving being involved with Ents\n(but don't tell the miss us) since the\nday I set foot in Imperial I reckon\nthat this year has been the best. The\nquality of entertainment has been so\npure you could have snorted it. The\ngood people of Ents put in so much\nwork, for so little recognition, I wonder at times why they bother.\nBut that seems to be the way of the\nworld when things are going well.\nPeople become used to being served\nup with good nights out, until they\ntake them for granted. As far as the\nUnion is concerned Ents have been\nhauled over the coals this year and\nat times I have had to put my head\nin my hands and wished the ground\nwould swallow me up. Naivety and\nthe dizzy heights of authority can\nbe intoxicating. To some members\nof staff and to future sabbaticals I pro fer the advice listen to Ents,\ndo not pontificate, they know what\nthey're doing. And remember.,\nwithout Ents there would be no\nheaving Wednesday and Friday\nnights, few bar extensions and little\nof that money we all like to spend.\nIf Ents went on strike to mmo row where would we be? THINK\nABOUT IT. And just for the\nrecord. Please give them a decent\nbudget. Jesus would find it difficult\nto keep the punters amused with the\nmoney they have to work with.\nThe other events I have put on\nthis year have gone well and they\nhave been too numerous to mention.\nThankyou for showing up and\nspending your grant wisely.\nRag.\nMy in vol v ment with Rag this year\nhas been brief, bordering on tang a brief. This doesn't though seem to\nhave stopped them making more\nmoney than sense and I take my hat\noff to them. They have at times\nmade errors of judgement that I would put down to having limitless\nsupplies of boundless enthusiasm\nand more limited supplies of\nexperience. We all make mistakes.\nCritics of Rag would have them\n'wacky' and irritating. At the end\nof the day they raise large amounts\nof cash that the disadvantaged\nbenefit from. How many of us\napathetic, lazy, self centred s loathes will criticise that?\nElections a go-go.\nWe have at last four sabbaticals in\nplace for next year. Not that the vast\nmajority of students at Imperial\nseem to care either way. The first\nelection turn out of 20% ish was\npretty remarkable and is about the\nnational average for student\nelections. (At the sake of mutual\nembarrassment I will not even\nmention the second election). This\nthough is still too small. Excuse me\nfor being an out of touch old hippy\nbut isn't youth all about self\nexpression, making mistakes and\nlearning from them (or not),\nexperimentation, ranting and\nraving, staying up past twelve\no 'clock, not wearing Brian May t shirts, upsetting your parents,\ndyeing your hair blue, eating badly,\ndrinking to Olympic standard (at the\ntax payers expense) and POLITICS.\nA worrying percentage of Imperial\nstudents seem to have already rested\non their laurels and opted for the\nMarks and Spencers comfy grey\ncar die in their late teens and early\ntwenties. Get involved and make\nsome noise! If elected sabbatical\nofficers have the mandate to hood\nwink, deceive, misinform and just\ngood old fashioned lie just think\nwhat the g over ment is doing to you.\nOn second though sI take this all\nback. The Conservatives have been\ndoing precisely the above for over\nthirteen years. Perhaps that's why\ngrey car dies are so popular?\nI have a vision.\nThe future for Imperial College\nUnion is both equally grim and\nrosy. The introduction of Voluntary\nMembership could be the final nail\nin the coffin for students. While\nbeing unclear as to what the\ng over ment is offering (answers on\na postcard to John Patten MP) I envisage tough times ahead. We\nhave never been about political\ncam paining here and so we have the\nadvantage. Representation and\nservices is where we're at and this\nyear has seen an increased emphasis\nin both these areas. Next year we\nwill have a sabbatical ( AGM willing) solely dedicated to\nrepresenting our club and athletic\ninterests. God knows we need one.\nFor too long College has shafted us\nand got away with it because\nsabbaticals have had neither the\ntime nor the inclination to do\nanything about it. If any of the\ndoubting Thomas's think there is no\nwork for a new sabbatical just ask\nRachel Mountford (Rag) or Carl\nBoon (ACC). We will also have a new member of staff dedicated to\nfinding out what you want in terms\nof services and events, and then\nproviding them. Maybe things\nwon't be that bad after all, but I 've\nnoticed that stocks of tin hats and\nshovels are running out fast at\nMillets.\nThe Richard Attenboroughs.\nAt various times throughout this\nyear Jonty has begged me to write\nhim '500 words on anything'. In my\nquest to be as unhelpful as possible\nI offer him 500 words on a selection\nof beautiful people\nAll the Union staff, Mandy\n'mums y' Hurford for being a pool\nof understanding and delicate\nin furia tion, the Finance office\nposse, Zona 'Iri I'O 'Sullivan for\nher never ending stream of put\ndowns, Pat Baker for her humour,\ncoffee and day files, Louise\n'Gunner' Van Der Straeten for her\nfriendship, love of life, mutual\nappreciation of Lowy and duff\nfootballing taste, Stef for never\nletting me play in his football team,\nCathy and Michelle for listening,\nreminding me that all men are\nbastards, lease of their magazines,\nunending supplies of sweeties and\ngoodies and ability to lie faultlessly\nwhen I needed them to. Cathy 'you\nwere fantastic!'. Chris for his\nbou n cie ness, green enthusiasm and\nguts to drag the Union forward,\nRick for reminding me where the\nmissing link went. The Catering\ncollective, Ian Richards for being\na genuine caring human being and\nbuyer of pints, I will miss you,\nYvonne for being there (get your\nboyfriend under control), Pete, you\nare a true star, Steve, Ian 'north\nbank', Emily, Liz and Terri. The\nbar staff, Andrew 'sashe,s as he' Flanagan for all his efforts and\n'offers', keep the vibe alive,\nGervaise for behaving like the\ntallest 2 year old in town, your\nscowls have been truly\ninspirational. Remember, when the\nwind changes, you'll stick like that,\nMarc, Andy P, Imran.\nThe Felix orchestra, Jonty, for fatty\ncoffee and a welcoming smile,\nDave Spoons, a renaissance man a crushed velvet, Ian, Stef, Simon,\nSteve, Andy for an ac como dating back passage and musical\nreminisce nse s( you may wear the\ngroove stone) and Rose (in the end\nit took me a dictionary to find out\nthe meaning of unrequited love).\nAndy Kerr, you may be small and\nIrish but you'll do for me, BJ, a stalwart, friend and alter ego.\nSomebody somewhere loves you\nboth. Andy Nu, 'man of gaffe r tape', Ian ' Mr Pickle' Nichol. Jill\n'the bookstore' for appreciation,\ncoffee, clippers and chats, Denise,\nMillie, Cathy, Ann (where did you\nget that calender from?) and Fiona.\nCollege refectories, doing bat de has\nbeen a pleasure. Stevie F for being\nan Hon. Sec. when I needed him,\nRachel M, all the student officers\nand those whom my memory has\nnot served well Kick off those\nsling backs and enjoy!\nChris's final words\nThere is no more, the end is upon\nus, but lots still to do. During this\nweek we will put the finishing\ntouches to the new plan for the\nUnion. Jonty's article last week\nexplained what is intended. This\nwill (wind in the right direction) be\nimplemented with the passing of the\nnew constitution at the Annual\nGeneral Meeting on Friday. A copy\nof the new (draft) constitution will\nbe available from the Union office\nfrom Thursday afternoon. We need\nyou there. I hope that the new\nconstitution will be clear, easy to\nread, contain the minimum of\nlegalistic nonsense and will take the\nUnion a step closer to the students.\nOne last bit of business. There is\na council meeting on Wednesday at\n2pm in the concert hall of the Union\nBuilding. You are very welcome to\nattend. There we will run through\na draft of the constitution, amending\nit so that the General Meeting will\ntake as little time as possible. Please\ncome along.\nFinally, this year has been\nunbelievable for me but would have\nbeen nothing if it were not for i hose who have been there to help me. I won't mention any names, for fear\nI should forget etc. I will leave it\nby saying that there are those who\nhave helped me have more good\ntimes than bad this year. What more\ncan you ask for?\nI rest my case.\nChris Davidson.\nPage 18\n\n"

There, with my natural\nwit and charm, I'd make them\nlaugh, cry and give me a job. Say\nanother week for my references to\ncheck out (and my cheque d bribes\nto check in) and then I'd be away,\nsky-rocketing towards my first\nmillion.\nI considered the timescales.\nSeptember seemed a pretty good\nmonth for becoming a millionaire.\nFine enough to drive to\nSouthampton in my open top\nLambourghini but the roads much\nquieter then in August. Once there\nI'd turn to face old England, gently\nbathed in an Autumnal sunset. Then\nI'd casual y raise two fingers up at\nthe whole miserable affair before\nsailing off to the golden Maldive\nIslands in a yacht called 'Slut\nPacific'. (Never mind the logo.)\nI couldn't help noticing my\nreflection - after all I'd walked\nhalfway across a branch of Miss\nSelfriges to get at the mirror. Oh,\nI looked the part. I Tube to Cannon\nStreet, full of hopes and shopping\nlists. I wasn't sure exactly how the\nset up would work - would those\ngrades merit two secretaries? Oh\nwell, with a personal computer\nlinked up to the global financial\nmaelstrom I could probably do most\nof the work unassisted. At least\nbefore any lunchtime beverages.\nThe building is huge and made of\nglass. Even the floors seem to be\nconstructed from glass planks. I hope allowances have been made in\nthe lavatory areas but then I realise\nthat there's no room for secrecy\namongst the team members. All outgoing s would have to be\naccounted for. The reception desk\ndirects me to room one six one.\nAt open-doo red room one six one\nI'm ignored. I cough. I knock the\ndoor again. I jump up and down.\nThe blue striped man only looks up\nwhen I begin to try to retrieve some\nfibre y rye bread from a lower molar.\nI blush and bluster, then pull\nmyself together. I try to start my\nspeech but he just says 'Job'. I nod\nstupidly. 'Go talk to Arthur in the\ncloakroom back at reception'.\nCloakroom? He looked back down\nat his work. I went to talk to Arthur\nin the cloakroom.\nArthur, the bane of my young\ncapitalism. He explains in his\nYorkshirean accent that I'm to be\nbrought in to replace him during\nsummer. In the cloakroom.\nGuarding peoples clothing. And\ngiving it back. Not even any\ninterest. I stutter. Bbbut, stock\nmarket? ECU's? Loud tables at\nrestaurants and a symphony of\nmobile phones?\nHe placed a hand on my shoulder.\nI trembled because I knew what was\ncoming. After thirty years putting\nwaistcoats on racks Arthur and his\nmind would have construed all\nmanner of Freud-flitting, Jungjuggling dementia s to cope with\ntheir tedious predicament.\n'Look at it this way son,' he\nbegan. 'Some men find their heart\nin music, or in horse-racing. Some\nturn their hands to a trade,\nbecoming bricklayers or carpenters.\nAnd my son Derrick has found it in\nhis wide-ranging collection of\nwoolly brown tank tops.' Arthur had\nclearly found his heart in\nPhilosophical pontificating.\nPontificating presently pointed at\nme. Would he ever end? A coat, a coat, my lost millions for a coat to\nrack!\n'But me, my fate in life has been\nouter wear.' Outerwear? Was he\ntalking about some city in Canada?\nI imagined the tourist hook -'Outaware, with its crystal clear\nstreams, breathtaking mountain\nranges and a special place in the\nheart of every senile suicidal\nnorthern dimwit cloakroom\nattendant'. Suicidal? Oh yes...my\nhands reached for his neck.\n'I can't say it's always been an\neasy road mind you,' he said,\ndumping an overcoat across my\ngroping arms. 'But the main thing\nis - ITS BLOODY OVER!' He\nburst into an insane laugh, his eyes\nsuddenly seemed like buttons, his\nlips a couple of coat-hangers. 'And\nnow you have to do it, and I don't!' More laughter. 'You,' stabbing my\nchest with his finger and dumping\nme another overcoat. 'You, you,\nyou.' Drowning under overcoats\nthe room goes hazy. His ears are\nlocker handles and the room\nwallpapered with ticket numbers.\nMy mind whirled. Would I stay\nhere forever? Maybe he'd just\nstumbled in here himself, a fiery\nyoung D.H Lawrence looking for\na few shillings beer money and\nperhaps a couple more for elocution\nlessons. But the place had\nconsumed him, blasting his soul\nbarren like it'd been sent to the dry\ncleaners. Now the curse had passed\nto me. But first I'd have to survive\nthe trial-by-coat, which didn't seem\nlikely from underneath them all.\nDeath in Outaware - a tale of greed,\ninsanity and an animal lust for a nicely turned seam. Decision time.\nI'm outta-here.\nLater I calm down. It's not the\nend of the world. There's still\nplenty of time to find another job.\nMaybe in a hospice, an animal\nrefuge or a childrens home. I still\nhave my pride (and a newly\nacquired prejudice). Hrnmmm, and\nI also have a briefcase to sell. Offers\nanyone?\nI'd just like to thank everyone\nwho's been mentioned herein at any\ntime for the geno rous bribe they\npaid for the privilege. Thanks to\nJonty, for unceasing\nencouragement, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to myth o log is e you and\nyour merry crew. Thanks also to\neveryone who's said they've\nenjoyed it (Or laughed\nconspicuously loudly in the JCR...)\nAnd un escaping Isabel, you're\nun slice able... a whole Patisserie in\nfact. Now your face can match your\nhair!\nBoulez at the Barbican\nPatrick Wood squeezes himself into the corner of a page to review Pierre\nBoulez's last est offering\nPierre Boulez has long been known\nas the arch-polemic is t of 20th century music. As conductor and\nwriter he regularly takes up the\ncudgels on behalf of those who have\ninfluenced him, particularly\nDebussy, Stravinsky and the\nSecond Viennese School. The fact\nthat much of the music of\nSchoenberg, for example, remains\nperipheral and in need of such\nadvocacy, is more a reflection of the\nmodern fashion for instant\ngratification than anything to do\nwith the music itself. Schoenberg's Five Orchestral Pieces, played by\nBoulez and the LSO at the\nbeginning of last Saturday's concert, are a case in point.\nRepeated, careful listening reveals\nthe work to be a rich and rewarding\ntapestry of sound. When every\nstrand of the ravishing second\nmovement can be heard, as it can\nunder Boulez, the music becomes\nas involving and coherent as\nanything Debussy ever wrote.\nIn Bartfjk's brash and percussive\nFirst Piano Concerto, soloist Daniel\nBarenboim was often compelled to\nsacrifice incisive clarity for power\nin an attempt to combat a large and\nenthusiastic orchestra. Even more\nplayers took the stage for the final\nwork, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring,\na Boulez speciality. There were ten\ndouble-basses, and the nine French\nhorns played on several occasions\nwith bells raised. Again, clarity was\nclearly a prime concern, and all the\nopening woodwind rustling s were\ndiscernible, as were such\nembellishments as panting bass\nclarinets and chugging horn ostinati\nlater on. And there was no lack of\nexcitement and rattling virtuosity in\npassages such as the headlong\nconclusion to Part I. But while the\nLSO, and the brass section in\nparticular, have never been reticent\nabout playing loudly, there was a disappointing lack of really quiet\nplaying. The reverential hush at the\nkissing of the earth became instead\na healthy mezzo-forte, and the only\nreal pianissimo came in the sinister\ntrumpet duet at the start of Part II.\nThe final Sacrificial Dance built up\nno little excitement (magnificent\nhorns baying like bloodhounds) and\nreceived one of the most\nenthusiastic receptions I have heard\nin the Barbican Hall for a while.\nPage 8\n\n"
