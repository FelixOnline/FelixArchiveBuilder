When doing research\nfor this article, it was also suggested\nto me it is possible to inject, however\nI have never seen nor heard of this\nhappening in real life. When sniffing\nany form of drug, the effects are almost\ninstantaneous.\nWhen sniffing, please ensure all crystals\nare crushed. This will not only ensure\nthat your nose doesn\u2019t encounter searing pain this Friday, but will also relieve\nyou of the torment of pissing out crys-tals. The pain which is only comparable\nto that feeling encountered when you\nrealise Trump has won the election.\nLegality\n\u201cOn June 10th\n2014, Ketamine changed from a class C to a class B controlled\ndrug. This means that possession of Ketamine could now get you up to five years\nin jail and an unlimited fine, while supplying Ketamine to someone else could get\nyou up to 14 years in jail and an unlimited fine.\u201d This is official government policy.\nHowever, in real life, if caught with Ketamine for the first time you are more likely\nto simply receive a caution (or a reprimand if you\u2019re under 18). Something akin to\na slap on the wrist from the police.\nThings to do when you\u2019re high\nDo\n\u2022 Chill out with your friends\nand watch a film, although\nno horrors if you\u2019re tripping!\n\u2022 Embrace the effects \u2013 don\u2019t\nworry, you\u2019ll be fine in an\nhour.\n\u2022 Make sure you\u2019re in an environment you\u2019re comfortable\nwith.\nDon\u2019t\n\u2022 Feel peer pressured \u2013 if you\ndon\u2019t want it, DON\u2019T DO IT!\n\u2022 Take with an upper (Cocaine,\nMDMA etc.) unless you know\nwhat you\u2019re doing. Speedballing anyone?\n\u2022 Take before any important\ntask. I shit you not, I knew\nsomeone who went to an\ninterview after taking keta-mine. Needless to say they\ndidn\u2019t get the job.\nWhat it does\nKetamine, put simply, is a general\nanaesthetic. Whilst infrequently administered to humans, it is more commonly\nused when operating on animals, predominantly horses. That\u2019s right boys and\ngirls, sniffing Ketamine is not dissimilar\nto taking the drugs required to sedate a\nhorse.\nThe effects don\u2019t last long, normally 30\nto 50 minutes depending on the strength\nand quality of the drug. Effects include; a\nreduction in senses likened to drunken-ness, a change in perception of your\nsight and hearing (more commonly called\n\u2018tripping\u2019) and the loss of the ability to\nspeak in a manner which others humans\ncan understand.\nSome statistics\nAccording to Home Office\u2019s \u201cDrug Misuse: Findings from the 2014/15\nCrime Survey for England and Wales \u2013 Second edition\u201d (doesn\u2019t it\nhave a fancy name for something so dull?), Ketamine use amongst 16\nto 24 years olds is decreasing. With \u201cProportion of adults (16 \u2013 24)\nreporting use\u201d standing at 1.6%. Whilst that may appear paltry I\u2019d\nwager there\u2019s a substantial number out there not reporting use \u2013 I\nmean why would you?\nK dog\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit talktofrank.com\nGlossary\nTripping / Trips \u2013 When your perceptions alter, allowing\nyou to experience hallucinations.\nKet Hole / K Hole \u2013 A state encountered when you take\nlarge amounts of (good quality) Ketamine. To people\naround you, you will appear unresponsive, however you\nwill be experiencing some shit hot trips.\nRacking up / Cutting up \u2013 To form your Ketamine in to\nlines. Normally lines are formed on CD/DVD cases, if\nanyone still owns those anymore.\nLine \u2013 Quite literally a line of Ketamine. Lines come in\nvarious sizes, from 0.1 gram (small) to gram lines if you\u2019re\na professional.\nKey \u2013 Quite literally Ketamine on a key (for example a\nhouse key). Prepared by simply inserting a key in to your\ntrusty bag of Ketamine, keys are naturally smaller than\nlines. Keys are often used instead of lines due to a reduced\namount of preparation required, it is not exactly convenient to start racking up your Ketamine in 568 is it?\nThe politics of pubes \u2013 how much is too much?\nAlthough being completely\ndevoid of pubic hair runs the\nrisk of making you look like\na prepubescent, the way that\nwe consume porn has often\nmake it the expectation, particularly for women. For girls\nthese days, this is something\nthat starts as soon as the\nlittle curlies start sprouting,\na contrast to a decade ago\nwhere removal of public hair\nbeyond a bikini line trim was\nan alien concept to teenagers\nand seen only in Sex and the\nCity.\nBut the times seem to be\nchanging, with various fashion magazines declaring this\nH\nave you ever felt\nlike someone\nwas judging\nyour pubes?\nMost of us have\nfelt under some\npressure to neaten up, groom,\nor man-scape our bits, but is\nthis a social expectation that\nwe place on ourselves, or do\nother people actually care\nabout how well maintained\nwe are down there?\nWhen it comes to having\nsex, no one likes hair in their\nteeth, but it kind of comes\nwith the territory. I think most\npeople with a regular partner\nfeel that some level of hair\nis certainly worth putting up\nwith if it means getting to\ndrop the hair removal routine.\nBut while just about everyone\nagrees that it\u2019s \u201cpolite\u201d and\n\u201cconsiderate\u201d to trim, many\npeople feel an extraordinary\namount of pressure to remove\nall traces of these tufty curls.\nyear that the \u201cfreedom bush\u201d\nis back in fashion. Actually,\nwhen people say \u201cthe bush\nis back\u201d, what they mean is\nthat now people want all hair\nremoved from a woman\u2019s\ngenitals, apart from a patch\nat the top that makes your\nminge look somewhat akin\nto Donald Trump\u2019s toupee,\nwhich is supposed to be\nartfully groomed so that it\ndoesn\u2019t look groomed at all.\nOf course, women naturally\nhave a lot more hair than\nthat, and this is actually even\nmore effort than asking us to\ngo completely bare.\nBut it\u2019s more cleaner, right?\nAside from wanting to feel\nsexier, the main reason that\npeople give for wanting to,\nand expecting their partners\nto be clean shaven, or at least\nneat and tidy, is hygiene. But\neven that is a misconception\n\u2013 pubic hair is there to protect\nthe delicate skin of genitals\nfrom friction, and the microscopic wounds created by\nall methods of hair removal\ncreate a breeding ground\nfor all sorts of bacteria and\nassists transmission of STIs.\nReally, are the stubble and\ningrown hairs worth it? A\npubic mound that strongly\nresembles a recently-plucked\nchicken is not a happy\nmound. It\u2019s entirely your business what you do with your\npubic hair; if it makes you\nfeel sexy to know that no one\nwill see the hairs in your butt\ncrack when they\u2019re ploughing\nyou from behind, then more\npower to you.\nBut one thing that I\u2019ve learnt\nis that everyone has pubic\nhair, and as long as it\u2019s not\nmatted and smelly, it\u2019s not\ngoing to be a deal breaker.\nIf you\u2019re spending time every\nday in the shower twisting\nawkwardly trying to keep\nyour undercarriage stubble\nfree because you think that\nis what is expected of you,\nmaybe try giving it a break\nfor a while and see what\nhappens.\nYes, there is unfortunately\nsome social expectation, and\nmaybe some people will be\nsurprised \u2013 for all the 19 year\nolds I\u2019ve slept with who\u2019ve\nnever seen pubes before \u2013\nbut when it comes to getting\ndown, they probably won\u2019t\nmind, and they might even\nlike it. And so might you.\nIf you\u2019re experimenting with sporting a hairy muff, here are some hairstyles you might like to try.\nMinimal attention required. A\ngood style choice when you\nhave coursework deadlines\ncoming up.\nOr the Boyzilian. A solid\nchoice if you think that\nanyone heading down there\nneeds directions.\nTHE BUSH THE LANDING STRIP\nGood if you want an excuse\nfor that cheesey smell. A\nsurprisingly high-maintenance\nversion of the original.\nTHE DORITO THE MOUSTACHE THE DONALD TRUMP\nBest worn during Movember\nor when on Erasmus in\nFrance. Perfect if you fondly\ncall your junk Hercule.\nIdeal for blondes. You can\ncomb this so that it covers up\nyour carefully constructed\nbald bits.\n\\\\ No one likes hair\nin their teeth, but it\nkind of comes with\nthe territory \\\\\n\\\\ A pubic mound\nthat strongly\nresembles a\nrecently-plucked\nchicken is not a\nhappy mound \\\\\n\n"

Efforts are\ncurrently underway for a\nmanned mission to Mars,\nand research is ongoing\nwith regards to how we\nwould populate the red\nplanet. If we can move out\nof our planet and mine\nresources from other plan-ets, then the universe is\nour oyster. Then not only\nis overpopulation solved,\nbut we could potentially\nexpand beyond any limits.\nBut this is a race against\ntime. Elon Musk with his\nSpaceX program and\ndesire to die on Mars just\n\u201cnot on landing\u201d may take\nus one more step closer\nto colonising it. He hopes\nto have astronauts on\nMars by 2025. NASA has\nmore humble predictions\nof sending astronauts into\norbit by 2030. Having an\nactual civilisation on Mars\ntherefore seems to be decades off.\nThere are those who\nwould preach for us to\nstop having children or\nto just have one child. In\ntheir self-induced panic,\nthey may even set an\nexample for the world.\nFair play to them. But\nbeyond the sudden pang\nof morality you might feel\nfrom hearing them preach\nand beyond the panic that\nensues from watching a\nfilm such as Inferno as\nyou tentatively put on\nyour intellectual\u2019s glasses\nand begin to consider if a\npopulation cull is what is\nreally needed, we should\nactually sit down and consult the figures.\nThe idea that population\ngrowth is exponential is\none that is thrown around\nquite a lot. And quite\ncallously might I add.\nFrom the comparisons of\nhumanity as a virus and\nthe images in your mind\nof cells dividing uncon-trollably, exponential\npopulation growth \u2013 the\nincreasing growth rate of\nsomething proportional\nto its total quantity \u2013 is\nnot supported by the\nstatistics. Starting at 1800\nin the space of a hundred\nyears we doubled, then\nin the next hundred years\nwe multiplied by around\nsix and in the following\n15 have increased from\naround six billion to seven\nbillion.\nHold on you say. Things\nlook like they\u2019re increasing crazily. However,\ncontrary to the panic\nthe internet will leave\nyou in, Hans Rosling, a\nSwedish medical doctor\nand statistician, believes\noverpopulation is a myth\nand will not surpass\neleven billion. He claims\nthat since the 60\u2019s, population has been growing\nsteadily, not exponen-tially. He explains that\nthe population will grow\nsome more, but as access\nto medical care, contra-ceptives, empowerment of\nwomen, better education\nfor women and men, later\nbirths, family planning\nand rising living standards all kick in, the birth\nrate will sustain itself.\nThe death rate and the\nbirth rate will be roughly\nequal. As living standards\nrise, people will have\nless children and focus\non giving them a better\nstandard of living. The\npopulation is predicted to\nreach 9.5 bn by 2050 and\n10.9 bn by 2100. So the\nvalue of 32bn within this\ncentury quoted in Inferno\nseems to be nonsense.\nThe idea that population\nwill stabilise therefore\nmakes sense. Add to that\nthe projected betterment\nof technology, the fact\nthat \u2013 as Ester Boserup,\neminent Danish economist put it \u2013 the threat of\nstarvation and increased\ndemand motivates people\nto modify and research\ninto agriculture, produce new technology\nand modify methods to\nincrease food production\nand better understanding\nof the world in general,\nthe future may not look\nso bleak. Overpopulation\nmay not even be something to fear. What we\nshould probably fear is\nus messing things up by\ndestroying ourselves in a\nwar that we can\u2019t come\nback from. And destroying the animal and plant\nkingdom because of our\nactivities and global\nwarming.\nOverpopulation may not\nbe the problem the film\nsuggests it is, but if one\nthing is for sure, while we\nmay be producing enough\nfood for everyone, we\ncertainly don\u2019t know how\nto distribute it. Instead of\nfilms like Inferno scare-mongering about the\nthreat of more humans,\nmaybe we should focus\non how to get the food we\nhave to those who need\nit and educate people to\nfeast responsibly and sus-tainably for the betterment\nof all. It\u2019s a crazy world,\nbut we have the tools to\nmanage it.\n\\\\ Overpopulation may not\nbe something to\nfear \\\\\n\\\\ In the last\n15 years, population has increased from\nsiix to seven\nbillion \\\\\n\n"

The man who inflamed an already polarised\nAmerican society, demonised his rivals, maddened his\nsupporters \u2013 the businessman, the tycoon, the clown,\nthe misogynist, the politician, the actual red terror \u2013 is\nnow a victor.\nIt\u2019s been particularly intense in the office.

The man whose followers\nhave insinuated assassination of political rivals and\npublic lynching of journalists? And all this has been\ntaking place in \u2018The land of the free\u2019.\nDread, disappointment and hopelessness is what I\u2019m\nfeeling at the moment. Perhaps a dash of anger, but\nmostly the numbness that comes with hopelessness.\nThe result of this election, like numerous others in\nrecent years, suggests a social split between groups so\ndisconnected they completely fail to understand each\nother. This is the scariest conclusion of all this political\nturmoil. We have lost our ability to communicate, to\nexchange and discuss ideas that are so different (but\nare they different at all?) they seem irreconcilable.\nThe fact that different ideas scare us so much, in fact,\nterrify us to the point of despair, is a problem.\nSo how do we proceed? We wait and see. And we\nlisten. We remove ourselves from our echo chambers\nand engage with opinions we don\u2019t like, at least until\nwe understand them.\nAs for the press, we stay strong. As many have said\nin the aftermath of the election, we must face our\nresponsibilty so that we don\u2019t have to face the music.\nToday, the need for truthful, responsible journalism is\ngreater than ever.\nT H E\nT E A M\nAmendments | The Review for Into The Inferno which appeared in issue 1646 was originally written by En Lai\nAddress | felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB || Telephone | 02075948072 || Printed by | Ilifee Print\nCambridge, Winship Road, Cambridge || Registered Newspaper | ISSN 1040-0711 || Copyright \u00a9 felix 2016\nEditor-in-Chief | Lef Apostolakis || Deputy Editor | Cale Tilford || News Editor | Matt Johnston || Comment Editors | Vivien\nHadlow, Tessa Davey, Johnathan Masters || Culture Ringmaster | Fred Fyles || Culture Editors | Indira Mallik, Ben Williams,\nSimran Kukran, Tom Stephens, Meryl Anil, Anurag Deshpande, Theo Farah || Puzzles Editor | Hamish Beck || Clubs & Societies\nEditor | Abigail de Bruin || Science Editor | Lizzie Riach || Millennials (Yaaas) Queen | Tessa Davey || Millennials Editors | Saad\nAhmed, Sanjay Battacharaya, Matt Johnston || Sports Editor | Sam Smith || Illustrator | Nathan Macabuag || Layout Editor |\nAbigael Bamgboye || Copy Chief | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || Copy Editors | Selin Olenik, Aishwarya Pattar, Tom Whiting || Cover\n| Esther Maltby || Centrefold | Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes\n\n"

Now\nthey\u2019ve introduced the Switch with a load of new\nfeatures. Question is, will it be enough?\nQasim Mahmood\n\\\\ By simply lifting\nthe tablet out of\nthe dock, you can\ntransition from TV to\nhandheld \\\\\nthough. A brand new 3D\nMario game was shown,\nalong with NBA 2K17 and\npossibly updated versions of\nMario Kart 8 and Splatoon.\nSurprisingly, one of the games\nthat received the most screen\ntime was The Elder Scrolls V:\nSkyrim. A large chunk of the\npromotional video showcased\na person taking his Switch\nT\nhe year is 2016,\nand the Wii U\nhas been doing\nincredibly badly\nworldwide for\na number of\nyears. In March, Nintendo\nannounced a partnership with\na Japanese mobile provider,\nDeNA, to provide some of\ntheir intellectual properties\non mobile platforms. While\nthis came as a big surprise,\nit was the news we received\nshortly afterwards that really\nset imaginations alight. In a\npress conference only a few\ndays later, they confirmed\nthat a new hardware platform\nwas in development, simply\ncodenamed the \u201cNX\u201d.\nLast month, Nintendo\nthe release date being March\n2017.\nThe Nintendo Switch was\nrevealed to be a tablet-like\nconsole, with two controllers called Joy-Cons that\ncan attach to both sides of\nthe console. These can be\ndetached and used wirelessly,\nin a similar fashion to a Wiimote and Nunchuk, all while\nplaying on the tablet. However, no official information is\navailable on whether the JoyCons are motion-enabled or if\nthe tablet has a touchscreen.\nThe Joy-Cons can also act as\nindividual controllers when\nturned sideways, though they\nseem rather small. An accessory called a Joy-Con Grip\nis also available, which acts\nas a holder for both Joy-Con\ncontrollers (termed L and R\nrespectively), and a more traditional Switch Pro Controller\nwill also be released.\nThe console itself can be\nplaced into a dock which\ncan be connected to a TV for\nplaying on the big screen.\nHowever, the tablet cannot\nbe used while docked, so\nit seems that Nintendo has\nabandoned multi-screen func-tionality, available on both\nthe 3DS and the Wii U. By\nsimply lifting the tablet out of\nthe dock, you can transition\nfrom TV to handheld, and\nto transition from handheld\nto TV, you simply place the\ntablet back into the dock. It is\nextremely simple and seems\nto work instantly, with the\ngame continuing exactly as it\nwas before the transition.\nNintendo has shown a\nnumber of games being\nplayed on the system, likely\nnot actual gameplay footage\nwith him on a plane before\nreturning home, playing\nSkyrim the entire time. They\nalso showed arguably their\nmost anticipated upcoming\ngame, The Legend of Zelda:\nBreath of the Wild, which will\nalso release simultaneously\non the Wii U.\nNvidia announced that\nthey have been working with\nNintendo to create a custom\nTegra processor to power\nthe Switch; they currently\nuse the Tegra in the Nvidia\nShield, their own portable\ngaming console. While no\nnumbers or benchmarks have\nbeen revealed, the fact that\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath\nof the Wild will release\nsimultaneously on the Wii U\nand Switch means the Switch\nshould at least rival the Wii U\nin terms of performance.\nThe Switch will play games\nusing game cards instead\nof discs, which is a clever\nmove as flash media is now\nfaster, smaller, cheaper and\nable to hold more data than\nBlu-Rays. Unfortunately, this\nimplies it won\u2019t be backwards\ncompatible with the Wii U\nor the 3DS. Ports, emulators\nor even accessories haven\u2019t\nbeen ruled out to play games\nfrom older systems, though\nthe latter is more likely a\npipedream.\nA number of third-party\ngame developers and publishers have been confirmed by\nNintendo to be supporting the\nSwitch. The list is extremely\nAre you making the Switch?\npromising and includes all\nthe major players as well as\nsome smaller companies. Of\nnote are FromSoftware, the\ncreators of the Souls series\nand Bloodborne; Telltale\nGames, who are famous for\ntheir point-and-click games;\nBethesda, the minds behind\nboth The Elder Scrolls and\nFallout; and Platinum Games,\nthe creators of Metal Gear\nRising: Revengeance and\nBayonetta.\nThe Switch seems like a\nmajor step in the right direction from Nintendo; they seem\nto be guaranteeing strong\nthird-party support and are\nalso trying to appeal to both\ncasual and core gamers. And\nright now, I think it\u2019s definitely\nworking.\n\\\\ The Switch should\nat least rival the\nWii U in terms of\nperformance \\\\\nofficially announced this\nmuch-rumoured console as\nthe Nintendo Switch, a home\nconsole/portable hybrid.\nThe promotional video they\nuploaded showcased many\npotential ways to play, with\n\\\\ Nintendo\n\n"

On\nreading it before\ngoing for the\nproduction at the Barbican, I\ncould understand why. There\nis a tangle of plot lines: star-crossed lovers, kidnapped\nroyal babes, attempted\nseduction, attempted\nassassination, and topping it\nall off, a war between Rome\nand Britain. The inevitable\ndeus ex machina is almost\nnecessary to bring all of them\nto the happy conclusion.\nWith this background to\nwork on, it is quite impressive that director, Melly Still,\nmanages to make Cymbeline flow coherently. In the\noriginal, Innogen, the only\nremaining heir of King Cymbeline, marries Posthumus in\nsecret against the wishes of\nher father, who wants her to\nmarry her stepbrother Cloten.\nPosthumus is banished to Italy,\nwhere he is deceived into\nbelieving Innogen has been\nunfaithful, and orders her\nmurdered. As Innogen flees\nBritain, a remorseful Posthumus seeks death in the battle\nagainst Rome.\nMelly Still takes several\nliberties with the setting, characters and even the lines of\nthe play. She is supported in\nthis by the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany, which certainly\nlives up to its reputation. I\ndidn\u2019t know Shakespeare\nhad such a sense of humour\nuntil I heard the lines brought\nto life on stage! Bethan Cullinane was especially good\nas Innogen \u2013 her delivery\nwas so natural, it was easy\nto forget that the lines of\ndialogue were written in the\n17th\ncentury.\nMuch has been made of\nCymbeline\u2019s relevance to\nBrexit and Britain\u2019s slide\ntowards insularity, but for me\nit wasn\u2019t the major theme of\nthe evening. There certainly\nwas an undercurrent of\n\u2018Britain against the world\u2019 \u2013\nmemorably Cloten\u2019s brash\nclaim; \u201cBritain is / A world\nby itself; and we will nothing\npay / For wearing our own\nnoses.\u201d Meanwhile, Italy\nis portrayed as a luxurious\ncasino compared to the\nbarren, resource-poor Britain.\nJust under the surface there\nis the not-so-subtle question\nabout Britain\u2019s fate; should it\ndecide to cut itself off from\nthe rest of the world?\nFor me, the more interesting\nfacet of the production was\nits exploration of gender\nroles; gender-bending is a\nmajor feature of Melly Still\u2019s\nproduction.

Then people will\n\u2013 having learnt their lessons\n\u2013 realise where they went\nwrong and rebuild society on\na more sustainable, simpler\nmodel. The war will solve the\npopulation problem as well,\nby wiping out a goo chunk of\nit. If the remnants of nuclear\nwar don\u2019t create an uninhabitable environment, maybe\nthe few lucky survivors will\nbe able to rebuild society. But\nthe tragedy beyond all of this,\nis that even if some survive,\nthe history shows humans do\nnot seem to learn the lessons\nof the past, especially not\nthose of war. Two world wars\nin the space of twenty years,\nand much more in between\nand after. It seems war may\njust be part of our nature.\nOverpopulation may just be a\nfrustration that lets us express\nthat nature once again.\nBut maybe science and\ntechnology will lead us to\nthe solution. And what will\nthat solution be? Maybe\nwe worry about earth as\nthe only planet we have,\nbut maybe that won\u2019t be\nthe case in the future.\nWhat if we colonise other\nplanets and our population can spill over and we\ndevelop the technology\nO\nn watching\nDan Brown\u2019s\nInferno this\nwe e ke n d ,\nthe question\nof how we\nwould survive overpopulation\nstruck a chord with me. It\nmay have been a slightly dull\nfilm at times but the theme\nnevertheless was a relevant\nand intriguing one. Essentially,\na billionaire concerned with\noverpopulation creates a virus\nto cull the number of humans\nin the world. Robert Langdon\nthen proceeds to chase clues\nthrough art, ends up finding\nwhere the virus is due to be\nreleased and *spoiler alert*\nultimately saves the day.\nDespite being a work of\nfiction, the questions asked\nthroughout the film seem to\nbe very real. At some point\nthe rising population will overtake the resources we have.\nHow then will we sustain\nourselves?\nMany have thought of\nsolutions, but most seem to\nbe about culling the popu-lation, not sustaining it. An\nincreasing death rate due to\nwar sparked by competition\nfor resources, or a decrease\nin birth rate implemented by\ngovernments, like China\u2019s\none-child-policy seem to be\nthe main options. But will\nour governments take action\nproportionate to the crisis we\nare possibly facing, or will\nwe mess things up and reach\na shit-hit-the-fan scenario like\nhumans seem prone to doing?\nThe population was 0.8bn in\n1800; by 1900 it had become\n1.6bn and by 2000 it was\n6.115 bn. We now stand at\nmore than seven bn. The\nnumbers at first glance seem\nto point to certain disaster for\nthe future.\nGiven the toxic mix of\nincreased population, further\ndamage from climate change\nand increased technologically\nadvanced and destructively\npowerful weaponry, how\nto manage and handle the\nproblems of the future are\nsomething that needs to be\ntaken seriously. So what are\nthe potential solutions?\nThe first and most obvious\none is the advancement of science and technology. Science\nhas been our \u2018saviour\u2019 which\nhas generated and sustained\nthe industrial revolution and\nallowed the population to\nexplode so dramatically.\nMost of the work being done\n\u2013 except those few eccentric\ngenocidal billionaires apparently \u2013 is in this area. From\nmitigating climate change\nand creating clean and\nsustainable energy resources,\nto improving healthcare and\ngrowing more food, all avenues are being explored. This\nseems to be the most obvious\nway forward without a morally dubious solution to the\nproblem. In our all-pervading\nmentality of the consumer\ncomes first, and rising living\nstandards of the world, most\nof us are not willing to or\nhave even considered radical\nlifestyle changes.\nYet these changes could\nbe a real solution to the\nproblem of overpopulation.\nThere would have to be\nradical changes to what is\ncurrently accepted as a norm\nof lifestyle; a solution where\nthe consumption of resources\nwould decrease radically. If\nwe are to strip life bare and\nthink about it, what is it that\nwe really need to survive and\nbe happy? Food, health-care, a roof over our heads,\ncompanionship, some sort of\nwork and some sort of enter-tainment. Instead of being a\nconsumer orientated society\nwe would have to become\noriented around not having\nand acquiring new things, but\nbeing satisfied with what is\nthere and finding pleasure in\nthe repetition. That is a massive and somewhat untenable\ncultural shift that would have\nto occur, but it is not impossi-ble. Yet statistics and human\nnature seem to be against us.\nDemands shift as living conditions get better. For example\nbetter lifestyles correlate with\nbigger demands for meat\nand dairy, so grain that could\nbe used to feed many more\npeople goes into feeding animals to make more of what\nwe want. But we need our\ncheeseburgers apparently.\nYet cultural shift is not\nimpossible. These changes\nhave been seen to come into\nplay via two ways \u2013wars and\nrevolutions. Both are tragic,\nbloody and traumatic. The\nlatter is a possibility but I\nthink it unlikely that people\nwould rise up in some sort\nof green revolution against\ngovernments, solely due to\nthe threat of overpopulation\nor indeed climate change.\nWhat seems more likely is\nthat society becomes reset\nthrough the almost unavoidable consequence of war\noccurring due to a fight for\nresources and supremacy in\na world which knows things\nare going wrong but refuses\nto face the facts. It as if the\nworld will head to a high\nenergy state; the bubble of\nour ego\u2019s will inflate and\ncontinue to do so till it bursts,\nexpends its energy in war,\nand finally returns to a low\nOverpopulation|Isitamyth?Isitinevitable?\nShouldwebeworried?\nJawaad Farooq muses on what the possible solutions to an overcrowded world may be, what the\nfuture may have in store, and why we should care\nF\nact: You can un-boil\nan egg.\nBoiling an egg\ncauses a fundamental change in the\nproteins that make\nup the egg white, which you\u2019ll\nknow if you ever had eggs\nand soldiers as a kid because\na raw egg and a cooked egg\nlook pretty different. The high\ntemperature causes the proteins to lose their shape and\ntangle up, turning the white\nfrom a liquid into a gloopy,\nrubbery solid.\nWhat you may not know is\nthat scientists can reverse this\nprocess, in effect \u2018un-boiling\u2019\nthe egg. A chemical called\nurea can be used to untangle\nproteins in the egg white,\nwhich allows them to then\nre-fold in the correct way.\nSpin it all around a few times\n(really, really fast) and within\na couple of minutes, just like\nthat, the protein has re-folded\ncorrectly and your egg is raw\nagain.\nApplications of this research\ncould save hours of labour\nin certain industries, and\naddresses that age old\nproblem \u201cI don\u2019t really feel\nlike a boiled egg anymore, I\nwish I could have scrambled\ninstead.\u201d Although you may\nnot want to try this at home;\nurea is a major component of\nurine, and that\u2019s enough to\nput anyone off breakfast.\nBreakfast\nTake Two\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nSpotlight on Medicine\nScientists here at Imperial\nCollege have created an\nextremely easy way of\ntesting for HIV. A simple\nUSB device detects the virus\nand sends corresponding\nelectrical impulses that\ncan be read on a laptop\nor handheld device. Not\nonly does this allow testing\nto be quicker, easier and\nself-applicable throughout\ntreatment, but it can also\nenable patients in remote\nlocations immediate on-site\nresults. The device itself is\ndisposable, and works by\nmonitoring levels of the virus\nin the blood. Before this\ntechnology, results would\ntake as long as three days\nfollowing testing, with samples often having to be sent\nback to laboratories. Current HIV treatment is known\nas anti-retroviral treatment,\nand works by reducing HIV\nlevels to near zero. The\nUSB sensor could be used\nto directly monitor whether\na patient is responding\nto treatment, or if it has\nstopped working. For\nsome, especially those in\nless developed countries,\nthis rapid way of testing\ncould mean the difference\nbetween life and death.\n1. HIV Testing USB Sticks\n2. Zika-Neutralising Antibody Discovered\n3. Key Protein for Spinal Cord Repair Found\nZebrafish are amazing\nwhen it comes to regen-eration. Even when their\nspinal cord is completely\nsevered, it can completely\nrestore itself. In humans,\na severed spinal cord can\nleave them completely\nparalysed or dead.\nResearch into spinal cord\nstudies and stem cells have\ngiven many hope that\none day broken spines\ncan be fixed, and now\nwe seem to be one step\ncloser. By studying these\ntiny transparent animals,\nscientists have been able\nto pinpoint the exact\nprotein that is responsible\nfor re-joining the spinal\ncord and enabling it to\nwork again. The protein\nin question is called\nCTGF, which stands for\nconnective tissue growth\nfactor. Humans also have\nCTGF, and although it\ndiffers slightly to the form\nfound in zebrafish, when\nthe human protein was\nadded it worked in the\nsame way. Although the\nprotein is not the whole\nstory, it gives scientists a\nclue to how regeneration works. The question\nnow is what does the\nzebrafish have, that we\nhumans don\u2019t?\nAccording to those\nworking on the project,\nthe next step is looking\nat regeneration proteins\nin mice.\n//\nNICHD\nNew tests have found\nthat a human antibody\n(given the catchy name of\nZIKV-117) can actually save\ninfected mice from dying of\nZika, whilst also shielding\ntheir unborn babies from its\nadverse effects. As I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019re aware, in humans\nthe virus has been linked\nto birth defects in babies\nwith infected mothers. This\nusually results in a smaller\nthan usual head and,\nconsequently, brain which\nmay affect the child\u2019s\nlearning, motor function\nand cognitive develop-ment. The condition is\nknown as microcephaly.\nDespite this recent break-through, researchers are\nunsure whether this\nwould work on humans,\nhowever they remain\noptimistic. Trials need\nto be completed on\nother primates before\nreaching humans, but\nif it works, could act as\nprotection against a\nnow terrifyingly widespread disease.\nBeacons of hope in this cursed year...

The\nmost recent example of this\nis the Dakota Access Pipeline\nproposal through Native\nAmerican lands.\nThat\u2019s why when I started\njoking about deporting myself\nif Trump wins, I eventually\nrealized how selfish that\nR\night before I\nboarded my flight\nfrom London\nStansted Airport\nto travel to Rome\nfor a short trip, I\nrefreshed a Google search on\nmy iPhone. My screen read\nthe following: Hilary Clinton\nwith 215 electoral votes, and\nDonald Trump with 244.\nHours later, as I was chatting\nwith two Londoners who were\ntaking the same train I was\nto central Rome, one of them\nsaid, \u201cDonald Trump won the\nelection.\u201d And here we are:\nthe day millions of Americans\nhave been fearing since the\nDonald declared his run for\nthe White House on the 15th\nJune last year. Many of my\nfriends are shocked by the\nnews. And I am too. But let me\nbe clear: Trump is not the main\nreason I am sickened by my\ncountry. It\u2019s the people who\nvoted him in.\nby that idea for him to reach\nthe magic number of 270.\nI could spend the rest\nof this piece criticising\nTrump for all the repulsive\nactions he\u2019s committed and\nwords he\u2019s spoken since his\nbut lost where it counts \u2014 in\nthe Electoral College. This\nelection has been anything\nbut predictable, and Trump\u2019s\nvictory fits that narrative\nalmost perfectly.\nClinton\u2019s loss must be one of\nthe most mentally devastating\nmoments in her life. Many\npolls showed she was the\nfavourite to win, and some\neven suggested she would do\nso comfortably. But did the\nrecent news about her email\nscandal cost her? The FBI letter\nthat was released was short,\nand answered few to none of\nmy questions about the new\ndevelopments.\nMultiple reports indicate\nthat the Clinton Foundation\nhas been suspicious with\nhow it hands out money to\ncharities. Clinton also has\ngiven speeches for Goldman\nSachs and other corporations\nfor hundreds of thousands of\ndollars. Even if we didn\u2019t see\nthe transcripts, how much is she\ninfluenced by big business? It\u2019s\na fair question to debate.\nI write about Clinton\u2019s faults\nunderstanding that if someone\nput a gun to my head, I would\npick her. But these are the\nreasons that Trump supporters\ncouldn\u2019t cross party lines and\nvote for her \u2014 including one\nof my best friends from back\nhome in the Philadelphia area.\nThere\u2019s an old saying that\n\u201cThe White House makes the\nman.\u201d I\u2019m clinging to this idea,\nthat once Trump is sworn in\nthis January, Congress will\ncheck him when he proposes\nsomething infeasibly radical,\neven though Republicans hold\na majority in the House and\nThe main sentiment Trump\nappeared to display during\nthe past year and a half was\nthat he was not a politician, but\nthat he was anti-establishment,\nand considerably self-financed\nhis own campaign. And\nenough people were captured\n300 million people?\nThis isn\u2019t to say I would ever\nwant to be a politician. First\noff, I\u2019m simply not a strong\nenough public speaker to fit\nthe bill. And more importantly,\nI am certainly not smart\nenough to be handling a lot of\nthe policy issues that drive the\nfuture of this country.\nBut then again, I realize\npolitics should be about policy,\nnot mud slinging.\nI\u2019ll return to the United States\nin December, and I won\u2019t be\ncertain what the atmosphere\nwill be like. But I will come\nback with the same mentality\nof treating people with\nrespect, like my mother raised\nme.\nAt the end of the day, I\ndo believe this country will\ncontinue to be united, even\nas divided as it currently\nappears. Because despite\npolitical differences with many\nfriends and colleagues, I \u2014\nand countless others \u2014 have\nbeen able to step back and\nre-evaluate what ideas and\npolicies we should implement\nfor those around us.\nI just wish that so many\npoliticians and voters wouldn\u2019t\ntreat the future of our country\nlike it\u2019s a fucking game.\nNorthern\nIreland\u2019s abortion\nlaws are outdated\nand inhumane\n\\\\ The current legislation\nsurrounding abortion\nin place in Northern\nIreland is anachronistic,\nand I am not speaking\nfiguratively \\\\\nMichael Purdy discusses the archaic\nabortion laws of Northern Ireland and\nthe obstacles in getting them changed\nF\nor generations the\ngears of the political\nsystems in Northern\nIreland have been\noiled by religion.\nNorthern Irish\npoliticians have interweaved\ntheir self-perceived concepts\nof morality (determined\nby their personal religious\nbeliefs) into the politics of the\ncountry. The religious beliefs\nof the country\u2019s politicians\nhave profoundly affected the\npassage of many pieces of\nlegislation through parliament,\nwhich has lead to the isolation,\ndiscrimination and, at times,\nsocial persecution of those\nwho do not conform to these\nbeliefs. Laws surrounding\nabortion are a prime example\nof this.\nfrom obtaining an abortion\nif she is raped or, in the case\nof fatal foetal abnormalities,\nunder punishment of a\nmaximum sentence of LIFE\nimprisonment. Thus, the law\nstill exists from a time when\nit was common for twelve-year-old children to work 14-hour days in cholera-infested\nfactories, and men were\nlegally allowed to beat their\nwives with a stick (but only if it\nwas thinner than their thumb).\nThe act is by no means a\ndormant piece of legislature.\nThis April a 21-year-old\nwoman from Belfast was given\na three month suspended\nsentence for carrying out\na self-induced miscarriage\nusing pills she bought online.\nThis woman\u2019s decision to\nabort the pregnancy would\nhave been one of the most\nemotionally and physically\ntasking moments she had ever\nexperienced. For the rest of\nher life, every time she applies\nfor an international visa, a\njob, adoption application etc.\nshe must detail this conviction,\nmeaning it will plague her\nindefinitely. Many women\nin Northern Ireland who\ndecide to have an abortion\ntravel to England where it\nis currently legal. This trip\ncosts on average \u00a3900, a\nsum of money that is not light\nheartedly expended in an\neconomically underdeveloped\ncountry. Thus, the law actively\ndiscriminates against working\nclass women who do not\nhave the money to travel to\nEngland for an abortion and\nare forced to have the child or\nterminate the pregnancy by\nillegal means. In November\n2015 Belfast\u2019s High court ruled\nthat Northern Ireland\u2019s current\nabortion law is incompatible\nwith international human\nrights. Furthermore, an\nto prevent a change in\nlegislation. This is not the first\ntime the party has opposed\na change in law that would\nfacilitate social equality. The\nparty\u2019s founder Ian Paisley\nled his party on a campaign\nto \u2018Save Ulster from Sodomy\u2019,\nclaiming homosexual acts\nwere \u201ca crime against God\nand man and its practice is\na terrible step to the total\ndemoralisationofanycountry.\u201d\nThis campaign intended to\nprevent the decriminalisation\nof homosexuality in Northern\nIreland.\nThe DUP, however, are\nnot solely to blame. The\nCatholic dominated pro-life\ngroup Precious life frequently\nprotest outside Belfast\u2019s family\nplanning clinic. Typically\nthese protests revolve around\nharassing and showing\nextremely graphic images of\naborted foetuses to women\nwho are seeking advice about\nundergoing a pregnancy\ntermination. The leader of\nthe group, Bernadette Smith,\n\\\\ So why then\nhas there been no\nchange in the last\n155 years? \\\\\nAmnesty International survey\nstated that 3/5 people in\nNorthern Ireland agree that\nthe law should be changed\nto include cases of foetal\nabnormalities, incest and\nrape. So why then has there\nbeen no change in the last 155\nyears?\nThe largest political\nparty in Northern Ireland\nis the Democratic Unionist\nParty (DUP). The party is\nand has historically been\ncontrolled by evangelical and\nfundamentalist Christians. The\nparty opposes any change to\nthe current laws surrounding\nabortion and has a large\nenough majority in parliament\n\\\\ This April a\n21-year-old woman\nfrom Belfast was\ngiven a three\nmonth suspended\nsentence for\ncarrying out\na self-induced\nmiscarriage \\\\\nThe current legislation\nsurrounding abortion in\nplace in Northern Ireland is\nanachronistic, and I am not\nspeaking figuratively. The\n1861 Offences Against the\nPerson Act prevents a woman\nclass a movie called The Silent\nScream. This involved being\nforced to watch grotesque\nimages of abortions from the\n1980s obviously in an attempt\nby the Catholic school to\nensure students associated\nthe procedure with feelings\nof repulsion. Statistically\nspeaking there was a very\nhigh chance that a girl in my\nclass at the time might have\nhad an abortion or might have\nknown someone very close to\nthem who would had one.\nNearly 5000 women in the\npastfiveyearshavetravelledto\nBritain from Northern Ireland\nto obtain an abortion. The\nopposition believes that legal\nchanges will lead to a spike in\nabortions, yet inevitably if a\nwoman desperately wants an\nabortion in Northern Ireland\nshe will have one. All a\nchange in the current laws will\ndo is help protect the mental\nand physical health of women\nin crisis and prevent them from\nbeing stigmatised by society\nas a murderer for making an\nincomprehensibly difficult\ndecision. Fundamentally,\nthe archaic legislation in\nplace inhibits one of the most\nsignificant human rights.\nFreewill.\ncurrently has a restraining\norder in place against her\nwhich was filled by a former\nBelfast MP (Dawn Purvis)\nwho supported a change in\nthe current laws surrounding\nabortion. This was a result of\ncontinuous and belligerent\nharassment from the pro-life\ncampaigner.\nThe education system in\nNorthern Ireland is also\ninseparably associated with\nreligion. The teachers actively\nproject their religious views\non the students. Whilst at\nschool I remember being\nshown in religious education\nannouncement more than 500\ndays ago. I could also blame\nhis supporters for failing to\nconsider the dangers of those\nactions and rhetoric.\nBut that ultimately doesn\u2019t\nmatter. Our system decided he\nwill be the next leader of one\nof the most powerful countries\nin the world. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting\nthat Clinton actually won the\npopular vote in our country,\nmentality is.\nI didn\u2019t fill out a ballot and\nsend it in, and that deserves\na fair amount of criticism. But\nwhy were many Trump and\nClinton supporters so against\nhearing criticism about their\ncandidates for the past year\nand a half? Again, how are\nvoters acting like sports fans\nwhen the issues at stake will\nshape the future of more than\n\n"

The\npre-game team run-through\nwas cohesive and the pre-match speech electrifying,\nthanks to ex-boy scout and\nrapid eyebrow-grower\ncaptain Morgan Ball. The\ngame got underway with Ball\nsending his namesake up high\ndeep into the Medic\u2019s half.\nA strong performance from\nIC\u2019s forwards turned the ball\nover in a ruck. After stringing\ntogether several phases the\nball was shipped out to the\nbacks where an overlap\nsaw fresher, and recently-turned animal enthusiast,\nTom Berrige score his first try\nfor IC.

With the Medics\non their heels, scrum half\nTakemasu kicked to gain\nground. Spanish Jean, keen\non spreading his culture\noverseas, chased down\nthe ball and proceeded to\nram his horn-like shoulders\ninto the skinny matador\nthat was the Medics\u2019 full\nback. A penalty followed\nby a lineout maul saw the\nforward pack march over\nthe try line for the second try\nof the game. Once again,\ndue to the aforementioned\ncircumstances, the kick\nsimply couldn\u2019t be converted.\nNow into the double digits,\nIC\u2019s minds drifted from the\nfield and complacency\ncrept in. Soon the Medics\nwere awarded a penalty\nfive metres from IC\u2019s yet-to-be-grazed try line. A\nquick pick-and-go saw their\nnumber eight cut through the\nline to score the wettest try\nof the game. The confidence\nbuilt up over the first half was\nnow gone. The score stood\n10-7 to IC at the break.\nThe second half saw both\nteams make several unforced\nerrors, resulting in a scrappy\nSavethecheerleader,savetheworld\nSrishti Bhasin\nI\nmperial College Titans\nare the university\u2019s\ncheerleading team.

At around 9:45pm there\nwas the sound of something like\nfirecrackers coming from the back of\nthe hall. The band stopped, all of the\nlights came on suddenly, I looked over\nmy shoulder and, to my horror, I could see\nthree figures with machine guns blocking\nthe exits. Immediately the three terrorists\nbegan shooting indiscriminately with their\nkalashnikovs, and people fell to the floor\nin a domino effect. After several seconds\nof sustained shooting, there was an eerie\nsilence and I took the opportunity to\nscramble towards a door in the distance\nnext to the stage. In those few seconds\nof silence following the shooting, as the\nterrorists reloaded their machine guns,\nmany people remained laying on the\nfloor and elsewhere there was panicked\nshuffling. When the shooting began again,\nI dropped flat to the floor and waited for\nthem to finish their round before attempting\nto make an escape. This happened several\ntimes.\nReaching the door, it turned out to be\nlocked (with a keycode adjacent to it).\nThere was a security guard standing\nnext to it. I was shouting at him to open\nthe door as we piled towards it and the\ngunman continued shooting from behind,\nand I remember he looked at me totally\nblankly and then looked back towards\nthe shooters. He seemed frozen by\nfear. Falling back on the floor, when the\nshooting subsided again, I looked up and\nthe door was now open. It led into an\ninternal stairwell.\nI was knocked to the floor in the doorway\nby people pushing me from behind. I was\ngetting trampled on by people trying to\nescape, literally stamping on me in blind\npanic, and I really thought I was going to\nget trampled to death. I desperately pulled\nmy legs from under the weight of bodies\nby sliding myself along the floor, managed\nto slip out of one of my trainers where my\nfoot was trapped, and somehow managed\nto get up.\nI ran a couple of flights of stairs, and\nthen came to a stationary group of people\non the 3rd\nfloor, one flight from the top.\nPeople continued to flood up behind me,\nand for a moment there was some horrible\ncrushing in the very narrow stairwell. With\nno fire exit at the top of the stairs, my heart\nsank. Suddenly, there was a really loud\nexplosion from below which literally shook\nthe building, and some smoke appeared\nfrom below. I could not see any way out at\nthis point and was accepting that we may\nall die.\nThere was, however, a skylight window\nin the ceiling of the stairwell that we\nmanaged to get the bars off, and started\nfilling out up through the window onto the\nroof. It took some time, but everyone was\nincredibly calm, and waited their turn. I let\na couple of women go in front of me, and\nhelped another person who was struggling\nto get up. Shooting continued from below.\nOnce on the roof, there was a man\npulling survivors through a window of his\napartment on the 3rd\nfloor. Around 70 of\nus stayed there in his living room, trapped\nand hidden in near complete darkness.\nWe were up there for around three hours,\nwith no idea what was happening below.\nThere were multiple loud explosions which\nmade the room vibrate, and further bursts\nof gunfire. We remained in almost total\nsilence, only the occasional whisper. It was\nfrightening, not knowing if the terrorists\nwould find us at any moment.\nAt around 1am there was loud banging\non the window of the apartment. There\nwas a collective groan from within, and\nwe all sunk even lower onto the floor and\nunder chairs, as we dreaded the\npossibility that we had finally been\ndiscovered by the terrorists. My\nheartbeat increased back to levels\nsimilar to when I was being shot at\nthree hours earlier. The door burst\nopen and it turned out, to our relief,\nto be the special forces rescue\nteam. We were made to stand up\nwith our hands behind our heads,\nlift our tops to show we didn\u2019t have\nsuicide belts on, and then filter out\nslowly in single file to street level.\nNegative symptoms kicked in\nseveral weeks after the attack. My\nsleep became heavily disrupted,\nand I\u2019d wake up suddenly at 3am\nunable to get back to sleep night\nafter night. Simple day to day\nactivities became a total slog under\nthese conditions, and my mood and\nenergy hit rock bottom. Over time,\nthis turned into a feeling of total\nand utter hopelessness about ever\nregaining any sort of normality in\nmy life, and a palpable sense of\nisolation. This was compounded by\nan overarching sense that I wasn\u2019t\ndoing the right things to recover,\nand the myriad of well-intentioned\nbut widely differing advice from\nothers on what I should or shouldn\u2019t\nbe doing to aid recovery only\nintensified the feeling of uncertainty.\nOn one of those sleepless nights\nback in January, I suddenly felt\nan urgent compulsion to properly\nmeet my father for the first time. I\nhad spent a significant amount of\ntime tracing him when I was 19,\nmet him very briefly when I was 23\nand had been in email contact with\nhim since then over the following\nseven years. Until that meeting, he\nhad not even known I existed. So\nI emailed him and told him I was\ncoming to the States to visit. Less\nthan a week later, I was on a plane\nto Arizona, and ended up spending\nthe majority of ten days with him.\nIt was a wholly surreal experience,\nbut a positive one and a crucial one\nto have at that time. The decision to\ngo was led from compulsion rather\nthan prolonged reason, and that\nfelt good.\nOn my father\u2019s side, I managed\nto find out that my ancestors came\nfrom Santander, northern Spain.\nThis was uncanny as I had elected\nto study there on Erasmus in 3rd\nyear\nof university, not knowing that many\ngenerations of my ancestors had\nlived in the same streets all those\nyears ago.\nLater in the year, I decided\nto find where my maternal\ngrandfather was buried and see\nif my grandmother was still alive,\nhaving no recollection of meeting\nthem. Several days of investigation\ninformed me that my grandfather\nhad been cremated but not yet\ninterred, and my grandmother\nhad passed away, too. I traced the\naddress of my maternal aunt, who I\nhad also never met, and since then\nI have met one of my two cousins.\nI didn\u2019t even know I had cousins\npreviously.\nIn May, I had to go back to Paris\nto attend the investigation hearing\nput on for all victims of the attacks.\nWith some free time before the\nhearing, I decided to go for an\nimpromptu jog. Running through\nEastern Paris, along the canal of\nSaint Martin, I continued through\nthe edges of the city and just kept\nrunning. When I got back to the\n\\\\ I could not see any way\nout at this point, and was\naccepting that we may all\ndie \\\\\n\\\\ Negative symptoms\nkicked in several weeks\nafter the attack \\\\\napartment, I had done 22km \u2013 well\nover double anything I had ever\nrun before. That was the seed of the\nidea for running my first marathon\nin the months to come.\nAfter a meal with friends on my\nsecond evening in Paris, I went\nback to the Bataclan. Arriving just\nafter midnight, the building was\nhalf covered in scaffolding and so\nquite hard to recognise from the\nsame side of the street. I crossed the\nstreet to get a better look. Scanning\nthe front of the building, I looked\nup to locate the apartment I had\nbeen hiding in that night. And to my\nsurprise, there was one set of lights\non the building \u2013 that apartment. I\nhad been told that everyone had\nvacated the apartments above the\nconcert hall after the attack, but\nthis bolstered my hopes to find the\nperson who had let me into his\napartment and truly thank him.\nReturning at a more acceptable\nhour the following day, I pressed\nthe buzzer to his apartment several\ntimes, but no one answered. Yet I\nhad a sense that someone might be\nup there, and had no other options,\nso hung about by the building\u2019s\ndoor. After about 15 minutes a\nwoman came to the door from the\nstreet, and I snuck in behind her.\nI got to the door I guessed would\nbelong to the apartment from that\nnight, knocked and a man in his\n20s answered. I explained who\nI was, and he welcomed me in.\nHe, his girlfriend and I ended up\nchatting for several hours about\nthat night and our experiences\nsince. The apartment was just as\nI remembered it, which surprised\nme. I thought that perhaps the\nheightened emotions of that night\nmight have warped my sense of\nspace, especially in near darkness.\nSince meeting the person who\nsaved around 60 lives, including\nmy own, through his selfless act, I\nhave nominated him for a bravery\naward and attempted to get him the\ncompensation he deserves.\nI went to my first concert since\nbeing at the Bataclan in May in\nHamburg. It felt flat. Apart from\nscanning the room for exits, and\nbeing more aware and watchful\nof what was going on around me\nrather than what was on the stage,\nmy behaviour had not changed\n\\\\ After a meal with my\nfriends on my second\nevening in Paris, I went\nback to the Bataclan \\\\\nsignificantly from before the attacks. But\nthe feeling and response to something I\nhad previously enjoyed \u2013 live music \u2013 had\nchanged.\nI started to think that nothing would ever\nmatch the adrenaline, the sheer intense,\nanimalistic, nature of those hours during\nand after the attack. Looking back, those\nfew minutes in direct line of fire were the\nonly truly instinctive moments of my life.\nI sometimes wonder whether I was just\nsleepwalking through life before then,\nand whether anything in my life will\never measure anywhere near the level of\nemotion and intensity of that experience.\nI flew to Nice on Wednesday 14th\nJuly, and the horrific truck attack on the\nPromenade des Anglais happened the\nnext day. Flying back to the UK the day\nafter that, and over the following weeks\nin which there seemed to be a spate of\nterrorist attacks in France and Germany,\nI wondered whether this was becoming\nthe new norm. Whether the frequency,\nand perhaps scale, of these attacks was\nto become regular and severe. Whether\nsociety might just become accustomed,\nperhaps even desensitised, to such attacks.\nI wondered whether we needed to start\ntraining people in what to do in a terrorist\nattack situation and what that would\ninvolve. What struck me on the night\nwas that our theories about life or death\nsituations,our\u2018fightorflight\u2019instinctkicking\nin, just didn\u2019t seem to hold up. The majority\nof people appeared to neither fight (near\nimpossible given the situation) nor attempt\nto escape, but rather froze with fear. And\nwhy wouldn\u2019t they? The situation was so\nfar removed, so detached, from anything\nthat the vast majority of people attending\nthe concert would have ever experienced\nor could have been prepared for.\nLocating and contacting estranged\nfamily, solving answers to long-unknown\nfamily mysteries, finding the owner of\nthe apartment to thank him and get him\nthe recognition and support he deserves,\ntaking up new pastimes, writing; these\nconscious acts have all been an attempt\nto make positive changes after the horror\nof that experience last November, and I\nsuppose to an extent a way of healing.\nThe culmination of these positive acts is\nthe idea of running the original marathon\non the one year anniversary of the attacks\nin memory of the people who were killed\nthat night.\nSo this Sunday, on the one year\nanniversary of the attacks, I will be taking\non the Athens Marathon in memory of\nthose who lost their lives. I am raising\nmoney for RedR, an international disaster\nrelief charity.\nCompleting the marathon is my way of\ndoing something positive out of something\nso awful. This past year has been emotional\nand at times very difficult, and taking up\nlong-distance running has been a massive\nhelp to me in terms of recovering and\nkeeping active and positive.\n\\\\ These conscious\nacts have all been an\nattempt to make positive\nchanges after the horror\nof that experience \\\\\nAny donation, however small, would be\nhugely appreciated not only by me but\nby my charity as well. To donate towards\nmy fundraising challenge or for more\ninformation, visit www.mydonate.bt.com/\nfundraisers/olliekemsley\n\\\\ Completing the marathon\nis my way of doing\nsomething positive out of\nsomething so awful \\\\\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n404\n- FILE\nN\nO\nT\nFO\nUN\nD\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n\n"

The result\nis an intelligent, nuanced science\nfiction film, the blockbuster debut of\nCanadian director Denis Villeneuve\nA\nt some point\nduring their\ntime at school,\nchildren will\ninevitably\nbe asked to\ndescribe something in simple\nenough terms that even an\nalien, having just arrived on\nEarth, would understand.\nLike much of what is taught\nat school, this exercise is\ncompletely detached from\nreality. It assumes that\nanother intelligent life form\nwould speak, that it would\ncommunicate in a language\nstructured similarly to ours,\nand that it would understand\nthe concepts we use to\nexpress ourselves. Language\nis essentially meaningless\nwithout shared experience\nor points of reference,\nand as humans we are\nonly able to communicate\nacross languages (and\ntranslate them) because we\nall experience and interact\nwith the world in a relatively\nsimilar way.\nNoam Chomsky, \u201cthe father\nof modern linguistics\u201d, even\ntheorised that the structure of\nhuman language is biologically determined in our mind\nand a \u2018universal grammar\u2019 (a\nsort of inborn understanding\nof how to form sentences)\nexists. So while we might be\nable to communicate on first\ncontact with a community\nliving in an unexplored part\nof our own planet, trying to\nunderstand and deliver a\nmessage to an alien life form\nwould be a monumental task.\nIn Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Arrival,\nthe extra-terrestrials that\nvisit Earth communicate in a\nway completely unfamiliar\nto humans. Faced with the\nunknown, humanity attempts\nto understand the motivation\nof their visitors, who touch\ndown across twelve landing\nsites around the globe. The\nstory is far removed from\nthe typical alien invasion\nblockbuster; it focuses on the\ncomplex process of translating a foreign language that\nno other human on Earth\nunderstands. We follow this\ntranslation process from the\nperspective of linguist Dr.\nLouise Banks (Amy Adams),\nan academic who quickly\nadapts to life on a military\ncamp stationed close to one\nof the alien spacecrafts.\nBanks works closely with Ian\nDonnelly (Jeremy Renner), a\nmathematician, as they piece\ntogether the alien language\nduring the small windows of\ncontact that the spacecraft\npermits them.\nThe visual spectacle of\nmodern science-fiction can be\ntiresome at times but Arrival\nmanages to surprise viewers\nvisually in the most unlikely\nof places \u2013 language. The\nink-like substance of the aliens\nflows satisfyingly each time it\n\u2018spells\u2019 out calligraphic-style\nmessages, with a circular\nstructure and grammar that\nmirrors the films circular\nnarrative. Sweeping shots of\nmassive spacecrafts against\nthe backdrop of various\nfamiliar (and unfamiliar)\nlandscapes create the sense\nthat the whole world is relying\non the exchanges between\nDr. Banks, Donnelly, and\nthe two alien creatures.\notherworldly as the creatures\nthat inhabit Arrival\u2019s fictional\nuniverse.\nEric Heisserer\u2019s excellent\nscript explains the complicated subjects of linguistics\nand translation without confusing or condescending\nviewers. It\u2019s difficult not to\nbe awestruck when the team\nof experts piece together\nanother part of the puzzle,\neven if these moments are\ncontrived and implausible.\nBeyond these complex\nthemes, the film focuses on\nDr. Louise Banks\u2019 internal\nstruggle, and it is ultimately\nher emotions \u2013 and the\nstrange visions that she\nexperiences \u2013 that move the\nfilm towards its revelatory\nfinale. Amy Adams delivers\nanother fine performance,\noutshining Jeremy Renner\u2019s\nemotionally flat portrayal of a\nrather lonely mathematician.\nWhile Donnelly is never really\nexplored beyond his role\nas a mathematician, we see\nthe human side of Banks as\nshe experiences loss and the\nstruggles of motherhood.\nYet for a film that attempts\nto challenge its viewers, the\ngeopolitics of Arrival fall too\neasily into familiar tropes.\nWhen faced with a potentially\nexistential threat, America is\nhumanity\u2019s saviour while the\nmilitaristic powers China and\nRussia threaten to use force\nagainst Earth\u2019s visitors. This\nsimplification of our world\u2019s\nproblems detracts from the\nattempted realism of Heisserer\u2019s script. If there is any\nmessage to be taken from\nArrival, it is that communication rather than conflict is the\nsolution to difficult and unnerving situations; the film is explicit\nBy Cale Tilford\n\\\\ The story is far\nremoved from\nthe typical alien\ninvasion blockbuster\nand focuses on the\ncomplex process of\ntranslating no-one\nEarth understands \\\\\nComplementing this, J\u00f3hann\nJ\u00f3hannsson\u2019s score, filled\nwith strange and erratic\nnoises, is as subdued and as\nin its criticism of military inter-vention, America included.\nIt\u2019s rare to leave the cinema\nwith an optimistic view of how\nhumanity would react to an\nalien invasion. Arrival might\nresolve in an unbelievable\nway but overall the film feels\nfar more rooted in reality\nthan its contemporaries. The\nfilm manages to condense a\nlong and complex process\ninto under two hours and as\na result, it simplifies in places\nbut Villeneuve and Heisserer\ncomplete this task deftly. It is\nan \u2018intelligent\u2019 blockbuster\nthat teaches the viewer the\nbasics of linguistics without\never feeling like a lecture, and\nit sits alongside Ex Machina\nand Upstream Colour as one\nof the most thought-provoking\nscience-fiction films of the past\nfew years.\nNah, I can\u2019t make it out either \\\\ Paramount Pictures\nArrival\nI know you are, but what am I?\n\\\\ Paramount Pictures\nGirls Lost\nT\nhe subject of gender\ntransformation has\nproved a rich seam\nof inspiration at\nwhich artists and\nwriters have mined\nfor centuries. From the ancient\nGreek myth of Tiresias to\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s immortal\ngender-swapping count in\nOrlando, the question of\n\u2018what would you do if you\nwoke up as the opposite\ngender?\u2019 has captivated\nmany around the world. It\u2019s\nthis question that Swedish\ndirector Alexandra-Therese\nKeining attempts to answer\nin her latest film Girls Lost,\nwhich centres around three\nyoung girls drawn together\nby their shared creativity and\nkept together through social\nisolation. Kim (Tuva Jagell),\nBella (Wilma Holm\u00e9n), and\nMomo (Louise Nyvall) are\nall misfits, facing regular\nmisogynistic and homophobic\nabuse at school. With little\nsupport from their families,\nthey turn to each other for\nsolace. However, when\nthey grow a strange plant\nwhose fruit allows them to\nexperience life as boys, their\ngroup begins to fragment.\nOn the surface, the divisions that crop up are related\nto the increasingly dangerous activities of Kim, who\nfalls in love with local rebel\nTony (Mandus Berg), and his\ngroup of delinquents. Seen in\nthis way, it\u2019s a classic tale of\npeer-pressure and adolescent\naspiration to conform (albeit\nthrough nonconformity), and\ndoesn\u2019t seem to add much\nto the genre. Indeed, Girls\nLost ticks every box that is\nrequired today of a European coming-of-age drama:\nsquat parties in abandoned\nindustrial complexes; a shot\nof someone silently screaming\nunderwater; there\u2019s even a\ncouple of daybreak rooftop\nscenes thrown in for good\nmeasure.\nHowever, what sets this\nfilm apart from others is the\ndecision to tackle transgender\nissues, particularly how trans\nadolescents feel at a period By Fred Fyles\nT\nom Kingsley and\nWill Sharpe follow\nup their delightfully-dark 2011 debut\nBlack Pond with The\nDarkest Universe,\na film that serves as both a\nsubtle reminder about the\nintimacy of family relations\nand a stunning advertisement\nfor the UK\u2019s canal network.\nSharpe stars as Zac, a city\nbanker whose already-diffi-cult life is turned upside-down\nby the disappearance of his\nsister Alice (Tiani Ghosh),\nrefusing to find herself a job\nor do any of the washing-up.\nZac and his long-term\ngirlfriend Eva (Sophia di\nMartino) attempt to change\nthings, first moving her into\nthe houseboat, and then\ngetting her to look after Eva\u2019s\ngrandma. But once Alice actually gets up and goes, a hole\nopens up in Zac\u2019s existence,\nand he is driven to the brink\nin an attempt to find her.\nWith this set-up, it seems like\nThe Darkest Universe would\nbe a depressingly bleak,\nMike Leigh-esque exploration\nof London life, but the film is\nsurprisingly upbeat. As Zac\nbegins to crack up, he pours\nall his energy into creating\na campaign to find Alice,\nfocusing on fancy websites\nand a regular video-blog in\nwhich he obsessively attempts\nto remain upbeat. These sec-tions, his \u2018postcards from the\ncanal\u2019, are the most effective\nin the film, allowing humour\nto cut through all of Zac\u2019s\nnervous desperation.\nWhile I loathe to use this\nword \u2013 which, in the run\n\\\\ In The Darkest\nUniverse, humour\ncuts through all of\nZac\u2019s despiration \\\\\nup to and fallout of Brexit,\nhas become more and more\ntoxic \u2013 there\u2019s something\nunmistakably \u2018British\u2019 about\nThe Darkest Universe. Not\nin a Carry On, kitsch kind of\nway, but rather how it reflects\nthe subtle nuances of the\nemotional and cultural life of\nthe UK. For me, the closest\nresemblance to The Darkest\nUniverse was Ben Wheatley\u2019s\nSightseers, which also took\na sideways look at modern\nBritish life through the guise of\na tour of the countryside, with\nall its subtle menace.\nWith The Darkest Universe,\nSharpe and Kingsley have\ncreated a delicate, fine film,\none that floats along with\na zephyr-like lightness. Its\nstrong cast, led by Sharpe,\nhelp communicate the\nstrength of family ties and\nthe crushing impact of loss in\na way that is insightful, but\nnever too heavy. The Darkest\nUniverse is a hidden gem, one\nthat deserves to be uncovered\nand shared.\nlast seen travelling down\nthe Regents Canal on an old\nhouseboat. Alice\u2019s presence\nhangs over Zac\u2019s life like an\nalbatross \u2013 a difficult sister\nwho in the past had been\nlabelled as possibly autistic,\nAlice is arrogant and difficult,\nCapturing the wonder of youth \\\\ G\u00f6tafilm\nThe Darkest\nUniverse\nof immense physical and\npsychological change. Kim\nis immediately more seduced\nby the idea of acting out her\nfantasies of being a boy,\nsimply because for her they\nare more than mere fantasies.\nWhile Momo and Bella are\nplaying a social role, Kim\nis discovering an explanation for why they\u2019ve felt so\ntrapped.\nIn this way, Girls Lost reads\nlike a combination between\nthe heartfelt exploration of\ntrue Swedish life found in\nLukas Moodyson\u2019s work and\nthe searing exploration of\ngender politics undertaken\nby C\u00e9line Sciamma. Girls\nLost doesn\u2019t meet the heights\nof either director\u2019s work, but\nKeining\u2019s ability to capture\nthe fleeting magic of adoles-cence, all twilight revelations\nand shimmery electronica,\ncombined with the bold decision to take on gender issues\nmake Girls Lost one to watch.\nWill Sharpe delights in The Darkest Universe\n\\\\ The Darkest Universe PR\nBy Fred Fyles\n\n"

Do note the lack of\nshame. I have no beef with\nsuch a statement. I am proud\nto talk about her previous\nachievements and will\ncontinue to be, even when\nour future children ask why\nI always lose during games\nnight. Again, not in a \u2018this is\nunusual\u2019 way, in a perfectly\nnormal, proud-husband\nmanner.\nWe are here to talk about\nImperial Girls Can. Last week,\nSport Imperial hosted a\nsuccessful five days of events\nwith the aim of getting women\nmore involved in sport.\nSessions included tag rugby,\ntennis and Halloween-themed\nexercise classes; sessions\naimed at the right target\naudience and reportedly\nenjoyed by all that attended.\nThere did seem to be a limited\namount you could choose to\ndo, some even suggesting an\nelement of sexism in those\nadvertised. I can emphasise\nto a certain extent, with a\nmuch heavier emphasis on\nfitness classes than sport. But\nlet\u2019s explore this more.\nDoes that opinion not seem\na tad extreme? Bringing\nsexism into this suggests an\ninsulting selection of classes\nwhose sole aim is to pander\nto women, condescendingly\nmaking them feel \u2018involved\u2019 in\nclub who said:\n\u201cWe were not given the\nopportunity to input on\nwhen the event was, 1-2\non a Monday was largely\nunsuitable as most people\nhave lectures, as such there\nwasn\u2019t an amazing turnout \u2026\nthe way they publicize and\nchoose event times needs\nre-thinking \u201c\nVery telling from two clubs\nwhose sports were among\nthe few included. The tennis\nladies inform me that most\nof the ACC clubs had events\norganised, but these simply\nweren\u2019t advertised to the level\nof that seen for Imperial Girls\nCan. On whose head this\nlies is not for me to say, but it\nshould be addressed in future\nevents.\nTime to deliver on the\npleasant surprise I promised.\nThe organisation may have\nbeen questionable, however I\nget the impression the events\nwere enjoyable. In fact, I\u2019m\ntold the tennis women who\nattended other events had\na great time and even got\nin touch with Sport Imperial\nsuggesting some be added to\nthe regular timetable. Again,\nthe rugby club agree with this\nand enjoyed their session,\nreporting that those who did\nattend had a great time. If\nthese events were truly sexist\nsurely the atmosphere would\nhave been one of anger\nand protest, not enjoyment?\nThe simple fact is that these\nsports and classes are things\nthat women enjoy, just not\nexclusively. Sport Imperial\nonly have limited resources\nbut it appears they delivered.\nBoth clubs actually expressed\ndisappointment that more\ndidn\u2019t attend, and the two I\u2019m\nspeaking to even inform me a\nboy turned up (shock horror!).\nBut only the one, guess he\nmust have been lost \u2026\nIn fact, he may well have\nbeen. As a member of the\nopposite sex, I did get the\nimpression the week was\nfor women only. At no point\nwas it made clear that men\nwere welcome to attend,\nbut as mentioned at the start\nof this piece, shouldn\u2019t it be\nobvious? Equality means\nyour issue too\u201d.\nMy interview with the tennis\nduo moves onto their sport in\ngeneral, in order to try and\naddress this. I\u2019m pleased to\nhear the Lawn Tennis Club\nhas very commendable\nfemale participation, but at\nthe social level there\u2019s a hint\nof masculinity that means they\nactually organised a women\u2019s\nonly event. Are men really\nthat intimidating? I certainly\ndon\u2019t feel it when doing the\ndishes in a fetching apron.\nThere is also an obvious\nfrustration that women\u2019s tennis\nis seen as a lower form of\nsports quality compared to\nthat of men, a thought which\nfans of hockey (Rio anyone?)\nand football (sorry boys, the\nfemale team have a much\nbetter track record) should\nknow is simply not true.\nI thank my guests for taking\nthe time to talk to me and I\nthank you for reading this, but\nI know nothing can be solved\nwith regards to sport equality\nin an 800 word article. I want\nto hear from all the clubs who\nfeel there is a lack of gender\nequality, I want more events\nbased around addressing\nmale participation in female-based sports (and vice versa)\nand above all, I want my wife\nto let me win for once.\na masculine world of sport as\nif pleasing a temperamental\nchild. I disagree, but don\u2019t\ntake my word for it, listen\nto the opinions of those that\nmatter. This reporter decided\nto go out and actually ask\nthose who took part, and you\nmay be surprised.\nI had the pleasure of\nspeaking to the President and\nVice-President of the Lawn\nTennis club (both women I\nhasten to add), who were\nkind enough to spare a few\nminutes before heading off\nto one of the aforementioned\nevents. I began by enquiring\nas to how Imperial Girls Can\nwas set up, organised and\nadvertised. It became clear\nthere was minimal, if any,\ncommunication between\nSport Imperial and the ACC\nclubs of Imperial College,\nechoed by the women\u2019s rugby\n\\\\ Sessions\naimed at the right\ntarget audience\nand reportedly\nenjoyed by all \\\\\nopportunities for all at supposedly single-sex events.

An\ninvestigation looking at figures\nfrom 2009 onwards showed\na marked increase in student\nled activity and its associated\ncost. This increase in cost was\nnot paired with a proportional\nincrease in direct financial\nsupport.\nThese results come at an\ninteresting point in time for\nImperial, historically struggling\nto maintain high levels of\nstudent satisfaction which hit an\nall time low this year. In fact,\nthe National Student Survey\n(NSS) report for 2016 revealed\na drop in student satisfaction\nacross all categories, which\ninclude Teaching, Assessment\nand Feedback, and Academic\nSupport. Satisfaction with the\nUnion in particular, saw a seven\npoint decrease from 2015,\nplacing ICU on 56th\nplace in the\nHigher Education rankings.\nIn his report, Cox said that\nthe \u201cCSP Grant had been\nmaintained in approximate\nvalue from 2012, not\naccounting for inflation,\u201d which\nis problematic considering the\nconstant expansion of CSP. \u201cAs\ncosts have increased without\nincreased financial support\nfrom the union, significant\ncosts are being pushed onto\nmembership income and other\nprofit making activities,\u201d he\ncontinued.\nAt the same time the Union\nhas been encouraging the\nexpansion of student-led\nactivities with the creation of an\nActivities Development Fund.\nHowever the funding is only\npartial and after one year,\nclubs are expected to include\nany new activities into their\nannual budgeting, funding for\nwhich rarely increases.\nIf many clubs and societies\nare to maintain the breadth of\nactivities they offer at student\nfriendly rates, they need\nmore money. The Union aims\nto renegotiate block grant\nwith College this year and\nconsidering the great lengths\nImperial is going to, in an effort\nto increase student satisfaction,\nit might just succeed. However\nCox warns \u201cthere is not an\nunlimited supply of income to\nthe union to distribute towards\nCSP funding,\u201d and although\nstudents seem to prioritise\nCSP over other services, more\nconsultation is needed before\nany decisions are made.\nImperial team wins iGEM competition\nMatt Johnston\nThis they did through an Apple\nand Android game, Go Culture,\nwhich aimed to dispel negative\nperceptions of microbes and\nbacteria.\nTheir successes with all the\nparts led them to winning the\nGold Medal plus five major\nprizes.

But do these films\nmark a breakthrough of the sci-fi\nglass ceiling, asks Fred Fyles? Or\ndo they play into the tropes well\nestablished in the genre?\nA\nround the\nhalfway point\nof Denis\nVilleneuve\u2019s\nlatest scifi thriller\nArrival, which touches down\nthis week, I found myself\nquestioning the circular\nnature of time. But while the\nfilm itself \u2013 with its focus on\nlanguage, neurology, and\nchronology \u2013 does try and\nupset our conventionally-held notions of time (to say\nany more would risk spoiling\nit), my confusion was more\nsimply explained as a regular\ncase of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: haven\u2019t we\nalready seen this before?\nYou see, what was brought\nto my mind most of all while\nwatching Arrival was Alfonso\nCuar\u00f3n\u2019s 2013 film Gravity.\nLike Arrival, Gravity was a\nbig-budget production \u2013 both\nfilms were visually resplend-ent, and I imagine Arrival\nwill pick up almost as many\naward nominations as Gravity\ndid \u2013 but what struck me the\nmost was how in both films\na decision was made that is\nrare in science fiction: both\nhad a woman as the central\nprotagonist. In Arrival, it\u2019s\nAmy Adams\u2019 Dr. Louise Banks\nwho saves the day, a linguistic\nexpert who is tasked with\ncommunicating with aliens\nwho land across the planet.\nIn Gravity, the stakes are a bit\nlower \u2013 globally speaking \u2013\nas Sandra Bullock\u2019s Dr. Ryan\nStone needs only to save her\nown skin after a chain reaction of debris peppers her\nspace-craft mid-flight.\nThe comparisons extend further beyond gender politics\n\u2013 Gravity and Arrival share a\nsweeping soundtrack, a sense\nof wonderment at human pro-gress, and an overt distrust of\nthe Russians \u2013 but something\nabout the choice to cast\nwomen in the centre of both\nfilms seemed bold, daring\nalmost. It shouldn\u2019t really,\nand yet, even today, women\nare rarely seen in cinematic\nleading roles, particularly in\nscience fiction.\nA study released earlier this\nyear from the Center for the\nStudy of Women in Television\nand Film, a unit at San\nDiego State University,\nfound that women\nmade up only 22%\nof protagonists in\nthe top-grossing\nfilms of 2015,\nmeaning male\nprotagonists outnumbered them\nby more than\n3:1. Furthermore,\nthis represented\na recent historical\nhigh: in 2014, only\n12% of protagonists\nwere women, indicating\nthat \u2013 despite the widespread calls of gender\nequality in some sections of\nthe industry \u2013 Hollywood\nlags far behind in terms of\ncritically scrutinised before\nwe claim it as a feminist\nvictory.\nFirstly, it\u2019s telling that\nwhile both protagonists are\nhighly-trained academics,\nneither work in what are\nclassically called the \u2018hard\nsciences\u2019 \u2013 Banks is a world\nexpert in linguistics, which\nis not counted among the\nSTEM subjects; Stone is\na biomedical engineer, a\nfield associated with the\nlife sciences, which are\ndisproportionately studied\nby women. This might seem\nlike a small niggle, but it\nhighlights how rare it is to see\nwomen occupy the roles traditionally associated with men,\nsuch as physicists and math-ematicians. Furthermore, in\nGravity, Stone\u2019s character\nis marked by her lack of\nexperience, and spends\nmuch of the film flailing\naround in space. It\u2019s\na stark contrast to\nGeorge Clooney\u2019s\ncharacter, a smooth\noperator who easily\nexcels at space-walk-ing, and has to help\nStone through the\nmore \u2018difficult\u2019 aspects\nof space-travel.\nHowever, the key problem is that neither Stone nor\nBanks are allowed to have\na narrative that stands up\non its own two feet \u2013 they\nboth need a \u2018hook\u2019, as it\nwere, to elicit sympathy from\nWomen in sci-fi | A space oddity?\nrepresentation.\nAnd thus, the huge success\nof Gravity (which made close\nto three quarters of a billion\ndollars), and the presumed\nsuccess of Arrival, should\nbe more than welcome. But\nthings aren\u2019t really all they\nseem: to me, both Adams\u2019\nand Bullock\u2019s characters\nmark not a breakout surge\nfor the woman-led sci-fi film,\nbut instead a return to the\nclassical tropes surrounding\nwomen in media. Rather than\nsomething that should be\nunquestionably lauded, the\nportrayal of women in both\nGravity and Arrival should be\nthe viewer. While this is a\ncommon occurrence in science fiction (despite the huge\nsuccess of the Half-Life video\ngame series, studio execs\nstill need to be persuaded\nthat we can empathise with\n\u2018normal\u2019 scientist-cum-ci-phers), in both Arrival and\nGravity the female leads\nare cast in wholly maternal\nroles. In Gravity, Stone has\nlost her young daughter in an\naccident; in Arrival, much the\nsame happens, with cancer\ntaking away Banks\u2019 daughter\nbefore her time. In both films,\nthis is about as far as it goes\nin giving each character a\nback-story, forcing both of\nthem into the role of the grieving mother, who pours herself\ninto her work to make up for\ntheir personal losses \u2013 in the\ncase of Arrival, this happens\nin, quite literally, the first five\nminutes. Neither character\nis allowed to be simply a\nscientist who is good at her\njob; presumably the studio\nexecutives believed that this\nwould be such an unengaging\ncharacter, so unnerving, that\na large dose of displaced\nmaternal instinct needs to\nbe injected in order to gain\nthe audience\u2019s trust. At least\nCuar\u00f3n had the good sense\nto resist throwing in a love\nstory, which is more than can\nbe said for Arrival.\nWhile this might strike some\nas me looking for problems\nwhere there aren\u2019t any, I think\nAlien \\\\ Allstar\\Cinetext\\20th\nCentury Fox\nArrival \\\\ Paramount Pictures Gravity \\\\ Warner Bros\nUnder the Skin \\\\ Allstar\n\\\nF\nI\nL\nM\n4\nan instructive comparison\ncan be made between these\ntwo films and The Martian,\nRidley Scott\u2019s 2015 science\nfiction comedy-cum-action\nfilm. The Martian, like Gravity\nand Arrival, focuses largely\non a single scientist (Matt\nDamon), who needs to use all\nhis knowledge to overcome a\nmajor issue. In the case of The\nMartian, the problem is that\nDamon\u2019s character, Dr. Mark\nWatney, has been stranded\non Mars when a mission\ngoes wrong. His solution? To\n\u2018science the shit out of this\u2019.\nIn many ways, these films are\nquite similar, with the lone (or\nnear-lone) scientist going up\nagainst insurmountable obsta-cles, and triumphing thanks to\nthe ingenuity of humankind.\nHowever, there is an\nimportant difference, and\nthat is that Damon\u2019s character\nin The Martian is allowed\nto stand alone, without his\nnarrative being bolstered\nby the perceived need for\nan emotional back-story.\nDamon is free to blow stuff\nup, dance around the space\nmodule, and generally be a\nfree agent; there is no dying\nchild left behind on Earth,\nno poignant moment of\ncommunication with a spouse,\nnothing \u2013 in essence \u2013 acting\nas emotional baggage. In this\nway, Damon\u2019s character fulfils\nthe typical archetype of the\nman alone in the wilderness,\na trope that dates all the way\nback to Henry David Thoreau\u2019s mid-19th\nCentury work\nWalden, which espouses\nindependence from others\nand a life of self-sufficiency.\nIn a controversial piece\nwritten for the New Yorker\nmagazine, Kathryn Schulz\nargues that Walden was \u2018the\noriginal cabin porn\u2019, which\nespouses \u2018a fantasy about\nescaping the entanglements and responsibilities\nof living among other\npeople\u2019. While Watney is\nable to eschew the duties\nthat accompany living with\nothers, Stone and Banks are\nnever afforded this luxury; as\nwomen, they are bound by\na heavily-networked web of\ninterpersonal relationships\nfrom which they cannot\nescape. The fact that\nproducers of sci-ence-fiction films\nfeel they cannot\ndivorce their\nfemale protagonists from this\nemotional mesh\nspeaks to the\ndeeply-ingrained\nsocial roles that\nwomen are expected\nto fulfil: mothers; sisters;\ndaughters.\nBut hasn\u2019t this always been\nthe case in science fiction?\nHaven\u2019t women always been\nrelegated to the side-lines?\nSurely, with these films,\neven if women are put in\nreductive roles, at least\nthey are protagonists?\nWell, the earliest history of\nscience fiction film is indeed\nmarked by a pronounced\nlack of women characters.\nWhere they did feature, such\nas in Le Voyage Dans La Lune\n(1902) and Aelita: Queen of\nMars (1924), they were cast\nas aliens \u2013 the most literal\nrepresentation of the \u2018Other\u2019\nthat you can get. Similarly, in\nMetropolis, Fritz Lang\u2019s 1927\nmaster work, which set the\nconventions for science fiction\ncinema for the next century,\nBrigitte Helm plays both the\nsocialist siren Maria and her\nevil robot double. Neither\nroles are particularly liber-ating: Maria is the perfect\nfr\u00e4ulein, a flawless mediator\nbetween the workers (the\nhands) and the ruling classes\n(the head), while her robot\ndouble is, naturally, completely dehumanised.\nAs we enter the swinging\nsixties, things don\u2019t get much\nbetter. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s\n2001: A Space Odyssey, the\nmost important film in the\ngenre, is remarkably free of\npathogen whilst navigating\nthe male-dominated world\nof hard-nosed science. We\nthen ended the decade with\nAlien, that classic landmark\nin both feminist film and\nthe science-fiction canon.\nWith the focus on the\nalien itself, in all it\u2019s H. R.\nGiger-designed phallic\nglory, Sigourney Weaver\nwas able to carve out the\nrole of Ripley, the warrant\nofficer on-board the attacked\nship. Not only does the\nfilm, with its visuals of\ngrubs popping out\nof chests, toy very\nknowingly with\nthe male fear of\nfemininity and\npregnancy,\nbut the role of\nRipley punched\na hole in the\ntraditional portrayal of women\nin science fiction.\nHere was a female\nprotagonist who was tough,\nhard-headed, and didn\u2019t need\nany man to save her. The\nscript initially had all the characters down as male, but the\nwriters explicitly stated that\n\u201cthe crew is unisex and\nall parts are interchangeable for men or women\u201d.\nWeaver embodied the role\nin a way that didn\u2019t draw\nattention to her gender, and\ndirector Ridley Scott didn\u2019t\nattempt to play up any maternal instincts \u2013 the result was\na character that is inherently\nfeminist, an icon of power\nand independence.\nThe next two decades after\nAlien saw a number of sci-fi\nfilms that toyed with the idea\nof a female protagonist:\n1986\u2019s Aliens, which saw\nWeaver return to the screen\nto kick some alien butt yet\nagain; 1991\u2019s Terminator\n2, whose Sarah Connor\ncharacter can be seen as the\narchetype of Mad Max: Fury\nRoad\u2019s Furiosa; and 1997\u2019s\nContact, in which Jodie\nFoster plays a SETI scientist\nwhose discovery of an alien\nmessage drives the film. Since\nthen, things seem to have\ntaken a step back, with films\nlike Ex Machina and Under\nthe Skin pushing women back\nin the alien/android box, and\nSpike Jonze\u2019s Her relegating\nthe main female character to\nan off-screen voice.\nLooked at against this historical context, we can see that\nthe female characters at the\nfront of Arrival and Gravity\ndo not mark a new golden\nage of women in sci-fi. While\nit is welcome to see women\nin front of the camera, they\nare forced into roles that live\nup to the old stereotypes of\nwomen: they are mothers or\ndaughters first, and scientists\nsecond. What science fiction\nneeds \u2013 indeed, what cinema\nneeds in general \u2013 are female\ncharacters who are simply\nallowed to be. Ones that we\nare allowed to simply relate\nto, as themselves, in all their\npower and glory.\n\\\\ In sci-fi, women\nare still expected to\nfulfill the social roles\nof mothers, sisters,\nand daughters \\\\\nwomen characters, and in the\nscience fiction films that do\noffer key roles for women,\nthey are often cast as mere\neye-candy, and little else.\nThink back to the 1968 camp\nclassic Barbarella, which saw\nJane Fonda as the title role,\nproudly holding up the image\nof the female adventurer\nwho must wear impractical-ly-skimpy outfits \u2013 a tradition\nthat continues to this very\nday. Director Roger Vadim\nspoke of his reluctance to\n\u2018intellectualise\u2019 the character,\nand this shows: Barbarella\nregularly adopts the role of\ndamsel in distress, and when\nrescued offers to repay the\nmen who come to her aid\nwith athletic sex. For context,\nthis was a film released half a\ndecade after Betty Friedan\u2019s\nThe Feminine Mystique.\nIt wasn\u2019t really until the\n1970s when women really\nmade their mark on sci-fi. The\ndecade kicked off with The\nAndromeda Strain, which\nsaw Dr. Ruth Leavitt save the\nworld from an extraterrestrial\nM\ne\nt\nr\no\np\no\nl\ni\ns\n\\\n\\\nR\nE\nX\n/YouTube\nA\ne\nl\ni\nt\na\n:\nQ\nu\ne\ne\nn\no\nf\nM\na\nr\ns\n\\\n\\\nC\nreative Commons\nB\na\nr\nb\na\nr\ne\nl\nl\na\n\\\n\\\nC\nr\ne\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nC\nommons\nC\no\nn\nt\na\nc\nt\n\\\n\\\nW\na\nr\nn\ne\nr\nB\nr\no\ns\nEx Machina \\\\\nA\n2\n4\nF\ni\nl\nm\ns\n\n"

The playwright behind Amadeus,\nPeter Shaffer, sadly passed\naway earlier this year, and\non the day of the opening\nthe director Howard Davies,\nresponsible for 30 shows at\nthe National over the past\nfew decades, also left us.\nThere is a pre-show appearance by Rufus Norris and\nNick Hytner (present and\nprevious artistic directors of\nthe National) to pay tribute to\nthe two men, and there is an\nundeniable air of melancholy\nhanging over the building.\nIt\u2019s an air that lends itself\nwell to Amadeus. This is the\nstory of Wolfgang Amadeus\nMozart told through the eyes\nof composer Antoni Salieri,\nMozart\u2019s self-proclaimed\nassassin. From his death-bed, Salieri gives a warped\nrecollection, crying out to\nthe dead Amadeus, begging\nfor forgiveness, pleading for\nmercy.\nAdam Gillen, playing\nMozart, occasionally threatens to overegg it early on.\nThe part as written is an infuri-ating, childish brat of a young\nman, so it\u2019s an inherently\nfine line to walk between\nhitting the right notes,and just\nputting everyone off. Early\non the performance threatens\nto become overwhelm-ing; Gillen is a ball\nof frenetic energy,\nlimbs flying every-where, his body\ncontorting itself\nthroughout his\nhyperactive vocal delivery. If\nmaintained for the entire run\ntime, it\u2019s a performance that\nwould rapidly get tiresome.\nHowever, as the play goes\non, and Mozart crumbles\nbefore us, Gillen emphatically\nlands the pathos of a broken\nman. It\u2019s heartbreaking to\nwatch; the pain manages\nJack Steadman\nto fill the enormous Olivier\nTheatre \u2013 a feat of no small\namount of showmanship.\nBy contrast, Lucian Msamati as Salieri is a model\nof restraint. The role is less\novertly theatrical but nonetheless grabs the audience\u2019s\nattention. Msamati gives\na towering performance.\nSalieri\u2019s fear of mediocrity,\nand the intolerable torment\nhe feels as he hears the music\nof God coming from the pen\nof a petulant child is made visceral in Msamati\u2019s work. He\neffortlessly nails Shaffer\u2019s mixture of comedy and tragedy;\n\\\\ Vast, and\nbombastic, Amadeus\nstill manages to\nbe both deeply\nconnecting and\npainfully human \\\\\nAmadeus is on at the\nNational Theatre until 1st\nFebruary\nMon \u2013 Sat 7\n.30pm. Matinees Sat.\nTickets from \u00a315\nAdam Gillen as Mozart \\\\ Marc Brenner\nby turns attracting, and\nrepulsing the audiences, he\nsubtly steals the show without\nanyone noticing. It\u2019s only in\nthe play\u2019s final moments, with\nMozart out of the way, that\nyou realise what\u2019s been in\nfront of you all along. Gillen\nmakes a valiant attempt, but\nthis is Msamati\u2019s show.\nThe performances are\naided wonderfully by Chloe\nLamford\u2019s stage design, and\nJon Clark\u2019s unobtrusive lighting which mesh beautifully\nwith the play\u2019s themes. It\u2019s all\ninescapably theatrical; the\nlighting rigs over stage are\nclearly visible, many of the\nsets are simply frameworks\nfor what they represent;\ncurtains attached to bars are\nneatly tucked away just so to\nframe the action behind them.\nThe staging underscores the\nshow\u2019s discussion of art and\nartifice, while also neatly\ncomplementing this retelling\nof events by an unreliable\nnarrator; the dying Salieri.\nVast, and bombastic in\nevery conceivable way (it\nhas a full orchestra in it!),\nAmadeus still manages to\nbe deeply connecting, and\npainfully human. It is at once\na celebration and a revitalising of Shaffer\u2019s masterpiece;\nby turning to a past success,\nthe National seems to have\nre-discovered just what they\ncan achieve. Critically, It\u2019s\nbeen a rocky road for Rufus\nNorris\u2019 tenure thus far (per-haps undeservedly so), but\nany memories of the under-whelming wonder.land or the\nlifeless The Plough and the\nStars are wiped away by\nAmadeus. Mediocre no\nmore, the National is\nback.\nLucian Msamati as Salieri \\\\ Marc Brenner\nH\naving just read\nWe Need to\nTalk About\nKevin I seated\nmyself in the\npacked Young\nVic theatre with considerable\nforeboding. All I knew of The\nNest, Franz Xaver Kroetz\u2019\nparable with an ecological\nwarning, was that it involved\na great tragedy becoming\ntwo young parents. I quickly\nrealised that my assumptions\nhad been partly wrong,\nunlike Lionel Shirver\u2019s portrait\nof a psychopath, there is no\nevil child here, or at least not\nan ostensible one, instead the\ndemon lurks in poverty and\nthe exploitation of labour.\nConor McPherson\u2019s new\ntranslation from the original\nGerman transports the tragedy to Ireland. The characters\nremain the same, the optimistic father, a long haul trucker;\nthe beleaguered mother\nreluctantly off on maternity\nleave, earning a desperate\npittance cold-calling for\na bank. Obsession with\nmoney permeates their\nlives and their relation-ship. \u201cHaving a baby\nisn\u2019t going to be\ncheap you know!\u201d,\nthe truism echoes\nthrough the thin\nwalls of their home.\nThe set design\nwas the aspect I\nliked most about this\npiece. The flat in which\nthe play is set feels like an\nabandoned IKEA warehouse,\ndeplete of all but the basic\nnecessities. It\u2019s sparse, and\nfrugal; the sofa is also the\nbed. As the audience, we\nwatch through the roof, as if\nwe are voyeurs in a new dark\nexpansion to The Sims. The\noutside world is no less omi-nous, shaded in the greys of\na David Firth cartoon: rusty\niron foundations jut outward\nover a polluted lake.\nThis sinister atmosphere\nis compounded by the\nelectronic music of P J\nHarvey which at times was\nreminiscent of the elec-tro-funk in the Midnight Run\nsoundtrack, and at times was\ndistorted and aggressive and\ncould have belonged on a\nNine Inch Nails album. The\nincongruence is effective. It\ngenerates a surreal tone, the\nkind we get in a dream where\nthings don\u2019t fit together properly and we know something\nmust go wrong.\nGo wrong it does, but not\nin the way the director Ian\nRickinson perhaps intended.\nIn the second half, the play\ncollapses in a paroxysm of\nphysical theatre and shouting\nthat is almost unwatchable.\nThe main issue, to regurgitate my previous analogy,\nis that the relationship\nbetween the parents is\nabout as believable as the\naffairs of two Sims, arguing\n\\\\ The audience\nwatch through the\nroof of a frugal flat,\nbecoming voyeurs\nin a dark new\nexpansion of The\nSims \\\\\nEzra Kitson\nThe Nest is on at the Young\nVic until 26 November 2016.\nMonday \u2013 Saturday 7\n.45pm\nWednesday & Saturday matinees:\n2.45 pm\nTickets \u00a310- \u00a325\nCaoilfhionn Dunne \\\\ David Sandison\nThe Nest\novereggs\nperformances to\ngive an uneven\nshow\nabout showerheads, empty\nfridges and puddles on the\nfloor. Caricatures don\u2019t make\ninteresting characters. The\nonly impression I got about\nthe parents was that the\nfather worked too much and\nthe mother was too worried\nabout money. Their dialogue\nwas accordingly dull and\nalthough there were rare\nmoments of black comedy -the father\u2019s defiant \u201cthere is\na lot more to life than mental\nhealth\u201d received the biggest\nlaugh \u2013 even the jokes felt\ntrite. Here lies the crux of the\nproblem with The Nest. If you\ndon\u2019t believe the characters\nthen the play\u2019s climactic trag-edy, in which the newborn is\nunknowingly bathed by his\nmother in a lake full of toxic\nwaste, becomes unbearable to watch. The mother\u2019s\nhysteria feels contrived. The\nfather\u2019s mea culpa descends\ninto a tedious ten minute pantomime of wailing and hand\nwringing. There is nothing\nmore boring for an audience\nthan to feel apathy while\nactors on stage enjoy having\nemotions. Paring down the\nmanufactured drama might\nhave served the The Nest\nbetter; less is more. Like the\nstricken child of The Nest,\nthis performance might have\nbeen resuscitated if only the\ndirector had understood this.\nYet the play is not a complete failure, and however\nhistrionic The Nest may be,\nthe moral lesson is not lost.\nPoverty is a rough beast, it\ndrives us to dangerous and irrational\ndecisions. It drives\nus to exploit the\nworld around\nus, and make\nno mistake,\nwhatever harm\nwe do to the\nenvironment in\nour lives will be\nreciprocated\ntenfold against\ngenerations to\ncome.\nLaurence Kinlan\\\\ David Sandison\n\n"

The simple\nflavours of the sea blended\nin seamlessly with the smoky\nflavours from the grill, infused\ninto every inch of the shrimp\nand diffused through our\nmouths. Our faces were in\nthe same happiness as the\nphoto of Munur\u2019s eleven year-old daughter savouring her\nfather\u2019s creation.\nTo allow our stomachs to\nbe full at this stage was a\nvery wrong move indeed.\nWe were presented with two\ndesserts. The first was a moist\norange and almond cake,\nwith coarse bits of almonds\nwhich was a surprise from\nthe usual finely grounded\nalmonds. The second was a\nwobbly delight \u2013 a panna\ncotta. This was not any panna\ncotta, but a burnt honey\nH\now do you\ndifferentiate\nbetween a good\nand an excellent\nrestaurant? Is\nit the Michelinstarred chef behind the\ncounter splattering sauce over\nthumb-sized morsels of food?\nIs it the extra 0.1 rating or\nhalf a star on OpenTable? Or\nis it the two-hour-long queue\noutside the no-reservation\nsystem every evening?\nDifferent people have\nvarying standards of a good\ndining experience. Some\npeople may tend towards\nthe quality of the food itself,\nwhile others deliver their\nreviews based on service and\nvalue. For me, the deciding\nfactor is not just the food, or\nhow accessible the booking\nsystem was or if I\u2019m getting\nwhat I paid for. What matters\nis something deeper: the\npersonal interactions I can\ncreate with the atmosphere,\nthe stories and the people\nthat accompany each dish.\nPerhaps this is why I tend\ntowards exploring street\nfood markets and small\nindependent eateries over\nwell-established chains.\nInstead of tasting the food\nexactly as how it was placed\nbefore me on the plate, I get\nto see action. I get to speak to\nthe person making my food,\nnot delivering my orders to a\nwaiter. I get to savour each\nowner\u2019s stories from their\npast, and their aspirations.\nIt\u2019s those tiny details that add\na greater depth of flavour on\nmy tongue, give understanding of the food, and establish\na long-lasting impression in\nmy memory.\nA restaurant that has\ngiven me exactly what I was\nlooking for was Popolo, an\nItalian-inspired eatery that\nhad opened just a few weeks\nago on Rivington Street, in\nthe heart of Shoreditch. The\ntwo-story restaurant was\ndressed in a dark grey, almost\nblending in with the quiet\nneighbourhood. Some paintwork in a contrasting yellow\ncolour paralleled with the\ngraffiti some 50 metres away.\nUpon entering we were\ngreeted by an open kitchen\nsurrounded by an L-shaped\nbar, giving full view of all\nthe kitchen theatre. Upstairs\nwas a small dining area with\ntables and a bar table stretching along the window. The\nsimple, grey, industrial-style\ninterior carried through from\nthe door up along the brick\nwalls, and was a complete\njuxtaposition of the vibrant\nexperience that followed.\nMunur, the manager and\nco-owner, greeted us with\nsuch welcoming warmth that\nwe instantly felt at home on\nour seats by the window. He\nentertained us with wonderful\nstories of his past as an investment banker, how he started\nthe restaurant with Jon, the\nco-owner and head chef, and\ntheir ideas. He showed us\nphotos of the transformation\nof the restaurant from an\nIndian takeaway to what it is\nnow, talked about the seven\nweeks of renovation with such\nexcitement while pointing at a\nwhite streak on the brick wall\nwhere the original white walls\nhad been.\nMunur left us to taste the\nfirst two plates: fried olives\nwith its roe still attached, on\na bed of lentils and green\nlaver seaweed. The scallop\nitself was perfectly cooked,\nstill soft and succulent inside.\nThe risotto nero came as an\nimpressive plate of glossy,\ncreamy, flavourful jet black\nrice, with generous chunks of\ntender squid and two cheeky\ntentacles on top. The Pulpo,\none of their signatures, was a\nplate of octopus and potato\nslices all in an enticing sun-set-red. The octopus was the\ncomplete opposite from the\ntough, rubbery, overcooked\npieces of protein you get\nelsewhere, and was soft and\nsupple.\nOur meal creeped up to a\nclimax with two more dishes.\nOur vegetable dish featured\nRomanesco and cauliflower\nChristy Lam\n\\\\ What matters\nto me is something\ndeeper: the stories\nand the people that\naccompany each\ndish \\\\\nand chickpeas on labne,\nand a plate of bright green\nPadron peppers. The olives\nwere crunchy golden nuggets\nexploding with their mellow,\nearthy juices, scooping up the\nsmooth, mild-flavoured labne\nand drips of chilli oil. The\nPadron peppers came warm,\ndressed in olive oil and sea\nsalt, and were soft, juicy and\nsweet.\nA selection of dishes from\nthe seafood menu appeared\non our table swiftly after.\nThe Capesante was a huge,\norange, grilled diver scallop\nvanilla version with sweet figs\npoached in red wine. The\ncaramel notes came through\nfrom the velvety smooth\ncream, introducing a strong\nfloral aftertaste.\nPopolo was what I was\nsearching for in a restaurant\n\u2013 simple, delicious food, in a\nunique atmosphere, people\nwho are passionate about\nwhat they do, and a wonderful story behind it.\nIn the age of Deliveroo and\nconvenience foods, why should you\ncook at all? felix finds how the easiest\nway to connect with people isn\u2019t in\nMetric or Nandos \u2013 it\u2019s over your\nstovetop (wine helps too).\nAndrada Balmez\n\\\\ I don\u2019t mean the\nmorning milk-and-cereal or ready\nmeals: I mean real\nfood, prepared \u2018with\nlove\u2019 \\\\\nWhy cook at all?\nT\nhe easiest way\nto make friends,\nanywhere, anytime,\nbut specifically in\ncollege? Cook!\nI don\u2019t mean the\nmorning milk-and-cereal or\nready meals you buy and just\nput in the microwave for five\nto ten minutes, I mean real\nfood, prepared \u2018with love\u2019,\njust as your mother used to\ndo before you left. I am not\na chef, but from time to time\nI like to cook and more often\nthan not, the food doesn\u2019t end\nup in the trash. And every\ntime I prepare something, my\nkitchen gets full \u2013 not only of\ntasty smells and veggies and\npots \u2013 but of people.\nSomeone just enters the\nrecipe or other, but most of\nthe time I just improvise with\nthings I have in the fridge.\nOnce I tried to cook a\nrecipe from an anime \u2013\nShokugeki no Soma, if you\nwant to know \u2013 and it was\nquite successful. So successful\nthat even though I planned\nmaking enough food for at\nleast two days, it was gone in\nless than half an hour with the\nhelp of six (or maybe nine?)\npeople. And this is what\nkitchen to get some water or\nsomething and they go with\nthe classic \u201cOh! This smells\ngood! What are you cooking?\u201d and I\u2019ll just ask them\nto stay and have a bite as I\nhardly ever really know what\nI am actually cooking \u2013 from\ntime to time I follow some happens most of the times I\ntry cooking something that\nrequires more than just the\nuse of a microwave.\nBut I don\u2019t mind. I really\ndon\u2019t. Actually, I like it when\npeople come to eat with me \u2013\nit somehow makes me feel like\nhome; people everywhere,\nwho talk about their day and\nare happy over some pie and\na glass of wine. The kitchen,\nquite a magical place, actually makes college feel more\nlike a home than expected, as\nlong as people have a reason\nto spend time in there.\nAnd this is so perfect for a\nshy person (like me). There is\nnothing more I hate than starting a conversation, but in the\nkitchen there is no need for\na start \u2013 people just talk and\nchange subject and laugh\nand spend time together;\nthere is no awkward silence \u2013\nyou always have the perfect\nsounds of food simmering and\nwine pouring. Cooking really\nhelped me make friends, and\nnot just friends among the\npeople who live in the same\nflat as me.\nBut don\u2019t take my word for\nit! Just go cook and share\nsome of your food with\npeople \u2013 even if you are not\nthat skilled in the kitchen,\nmost people would appreciate the effort and the fact that\nyou thought about them too.\n(Of course, they would\nappreciate it even more if you\ncould serve them a perfectly\ncooked steak and some chocolate cake, but hey, you\u2019re\nonly a student and you\u2019ve just\nbegan your journey in the\nkitchen).\nI mean, there aren\u2019t college rules on plaigarism for cooking...\nQuick and easy\nNo, I\u2019m not describing one of your\nsexcapades \u2013 that would lose me\nmy job. Here\u2019s a simple weeknight\nrecipe for something you can really\ncall home cooking.\nI\nmust confess \u2013 the last\ntime I made a stew, it took\nme 72 hours from start to\nfinish. Short ribs, cooked\nat 54o\nC for two-and-a-half days in my waterbath\nwere mouthwateringly tender\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nand exceptionally beefy, with\na wonderful red wine sauce\nand plenty of just tender veg.\nBut fear not! You don\u2019t need\nto raid the lab for a waterbath\nfor this stew.\nI\u2019ve tried to keep it quite\nsimple here, but feel free to\nmix it up as much as you want.\nBeef can be swapped for lamb\nor pork, but try and pick stewing cuts \u2013 they\u2019re cheaper,\nanyhow.\nStart by heating the oil \u2013 a\ngood splash \u2013 in a large pan.\nWhen almost smoking, add in\nhalf the beef and get stirring\n\u2013 you don\u2019t want to burn any-thing, but it needs to brown.\nTurn the heat down slightly\nand keep frying the beef until\nit is really brown on all sides.\nRemove the first batch of\nmeat to a bowl and repeat\nwith the second half. Once\nbrowned, remove the meat\nfrom the pan, leaving behind\nmost of the fat. To this, add the\ncarrots, sliced into very thick\nrounds. Get them browning\ntoo, whilst you halve and slice\nthe onions thickly, with the\ngrain (ie. from root to tip). Add\nthem to the pan, and keep\nfrying. If at any point things\nseem to be catching, add a\nsplash of water to that part of\nthe pan and stir to loosen it.\nReturn the beef to the pan,\nand add a good handful of\nflour, along with plenty of\nground black pepper and the\nherbs. Keep stirring to get the\nflour all cooked out, and get\nrid of any lumps. Slice up the\ngarlic cloves and toss them in\nwith the crumbled stock cube,\nbefore adding in the liquid of\nyour choosing \u2013 a nice amber\nale or a strong red would\nwork well, but so would box\nwine or just water (fosters?).\nBring to the simmer and let\nstew, uncovered \u2013 I would\nadvise anywhere from two-four hours, depending on your\ncut of beef. Finsh with worces-tershire, and add the frozen\npeas at the last minute.\nMakes enough for 4\nIngredients\nCooking oil\n500g stewing beef\n500g carrots, scrubbed\n1 large onion, peeled\nPlain flour\nPepper\nOregano, thyme\n2 cloves garlic, peeled.\nBeef stock cube\n500ml ale/red wine/water\nWorcestershire sauce\n300g frozen peas\n\n"

Clearly,\nthere\u2019s a catch. The acting\nis, unsurprisingly, great\nalthough Danson and Bell\ndo tend to dominate on that\nfront. Danson really gets\nto show off his versatility\nhere, successfully capturing\nMichael\u2019s unsure yet\noptimistic nature.

The show cleverly\ninverts the usual comedic\nformula of a straight man\nin an absurd world, with an\nincredibly absurd man in a\ndepressingly realistic world.\nThe pilot does a fantastic job\nof establishing this new City\u2019s\nstatus quo, and introducing\nus succinctly to the main cast.\nIn particular, the decision\nto make the point-of-view\ncharacter Arthur, instead of\nthe Tick, is to be commended.\nIn addition to grounding\nthe viewers\u2019 perspectives, it\nalso adds another layer of\nobsessive tendencies with his genuine desire to do good. The ever\nunderrated Jackie Earle Haley puts\nin a typically solid and understated\nperformance as the Terror. Serafinowicz seems to have a great\ntime cheesing it up as the blue bug,\nand while he doesn\u2019t quite match\nWarburton\u2019s highs, he does an\namicable job. I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll\ngrow into the role, given the time.\nThe series is a solid blend of satire,\ndark comedy, drama, and classic\nsuperhero cheese. \t\t\t\nIf you\u2019re a fan of any of those, do\ngive this series a chance.\nintrigue; we can never really be\nsure if the Tick truly exists, or is just\na manifestation of Arthur\u2019s mental\nillness. Griffin Newman does an\nexcellent job of balancing Arthur\u2019s\nThe Tick\nAnurag Deshpande\nThe Good\nPlace\nAnurag Deshpande\n\\\\ It evokes\nmemories of cult\nclassics such as\nPushing Daisies \\\\\nout comedic moments are\nfew and far between. So if\nyou prefer big jokes, you\nmay not enjoy this as much.\nConversely though, a lot\nof attention is paid to small\ndetails, and there is often\nhumour to be drawn from\nseemingly small elements of\nthe background. The series\nalso manages to build an\nuncharacteristically rich\nlore for a sitcom, all without\nthrusting needless exposition\nor details onto the viewer.\nThe show has more layers\nand mysteries than initial\nB\necker, Ted Danson\u2019s\nunderrated late 90s\nsitcom gem, was\nsomething of a staple\nof my formative years.\nSo, naturally, when a\nnew sitcom with his involvement\nwas announced, I took notice. The\nGood Place follows one Eleanor\nShellstrop, played by Kristen\nBell, who dies in a freak erectile\ndysfunction-related accident and\nfinds herself in the titular \u2018Good\nPlace\u2019. There\u2019s just one problem,\nEleanor is nowhere near as \u2018good\u2019\na person as the location\u2019s creator\nMichael, played by Danson,\nbelieves her to be. \t\t\nThe series generally follows her\nas she attempts to fit in with her\nsurroundings and avoid getting\ncaught and sent to \u2018The Bad\nPlace\u2019, helpfully described by\nhorrific screaming. The premise,\nthough it may sound outlandish,\nis a refreshing change from\nthe banality of contemporary\nnetwork sitcoms. Instead, it evokes\nmemories of cult classics such as\nPushing Daisies, with similarly\nbubble-gummy visuals. Similarly,\nthe comedy is not abrasive,\nostentatious, or too in-your-face. Jokes are subtle and\nconsistent, keeping you\nentertained throughout.\nHowever, extremely standIt\u2019s always awkward when they get\nyour name wrong \\\\ NBCUniversal\nThe new face of heroism \\\\ Amazon\n\n"

Only\ntime will tell \\\\\nWhat went down?\nBetween about midnight\nand 7am on Wednesday\nmorning, as the polls closed\nacross America and counting\ncommenced as the results\nbegan to eventually trickle\nin. The way the US election\nworks is that people can\u2019t\nreally be arsed waiting\naround until all votes have\nbeen counted. Instead a\npanel of experts and statisticians for each TV network\nsit down and analyse the\ncumulative vote tally as all the\nlittle voting areas send in their\ntotals. This means that once a\nvery strong trend is seen and\nthe experts are sure a state\nis going one way or another\nthey \u2018call\u2019 it and it\u2019s added to\nthe electoral college votes.\nThis means some results came\nin pretty quickly after voting\nstopped.\nNo big surprises early on,\nthe Democrat states voted for\nHillary Clinton and the Republican ones went for Trump.\nThe key to the election lied in\nthe swing states with the large\nnumber of electoral votes\n(Pennsylvania, Ohio and king\nof them all, Florida). Trump\nwon those as well as the\nRepublican heartlands and so\nwon the election. Simple.\nWhy were the polls wrong?\nProbably shy Trump voters\nhiding their true intentions,\nalthough currently the big\nforecasters are in post\nmortem mode. The underlying\nvoting demographics are\nlikely to be scrutinised for\nwhere the surges (or\nsuppressions) that helped\nTrump were. The results\nwere 228 for Clinton and\n279 for Trump (9 over the\nmagical 270 electoral votes\nneeded). But Clinton leads\nthe popular vote, 59,942,917\nto 59,704,842. More people\nvoted for her but she lost.\nWelcome to democracy.\nAside from the main\nprizefight there were the\nelections for parts of Congress. Another great night for\nthe Republicans who came\naway with both the House of\nRepresentatives and Senate\n(the two parts of Congress)\nmeaning that they now hold\nthe balance of power in both\nlegislative bodies that motions\nhave to pass. This means that\nit\u2019s easier for Trump to enact\nthings he wants to, as long as\nthese align with the views of\nthe wider Republican party.\nIf Trump strays too far right\n(or even left) they\u2019ll hopefully\nkeep him on the straight and\nnarrow. Parts of Congress are\nup for grabs next year again\nand so control of one or both\nthe branches could fall back\ninto Democrat hands, keeping\nan even tighter leash on The\nDonald. Oh and by virtue of\nthem being on a joint ticket,\nMike Pence is now the Vice\nPresident. Will he accomplish\nanything? Will he become\npresident when Trump gets\nbored and leaves? Who\nknows.\nAfter Trump managed half\nthe 538 Electoral College\nvotes, twitter, financial mar-kets, and quite a lot of the\nwider world started to freak\nout. The FTSE (UK), Dax\n(Germany), Dow Jones and\nNasdaq (both US) all plummeted upon hearing the news\nbefore actually regaining\nto roughly where they were\nbefore. Massive currency\nfluctuations were seen at first\nand then died down but this\nWhat\u2019shappenedsince?\nis only early days. Gold was\nup in price in the immediate\naftermath, great news for all\nyou pirates out there.\nInternational governments\nqueued up to give the customary congratulations to\nTrump with varying degrees\nof sincerity. Putin was first and\nhopes to strengthen US-Russian relations with Trump (the\ntwo of them have praised\neach other in the past). Theresa May also passed on her\ncongratulations; she doesn\u2019t\nwant to lose both the US and\nthe EU as a trading partner in\none year, after all. Anti-Trump\nriots were also a thing, with\neffigies of the president elect\nbeing burnt in several cities\nacross the US as well as a\nprotest at the US embassy in\nLondon too (see page 5).\nWhat\u2019snext?\nErm, nobody really knows.\nTrump will be sworn in officially on January 20th\nand\nfrom then his reign begins.\nHow chaotic and apocalyptic\nit will be remains to be seen.\nHe might start a few wars, he\nmight kickstart the economy\nor he might do both. Only\ntime will tell.\n\\\\ Clinton leads\nthe popular vote.\nMore people voted\nfor her but she\nlost. Welcome to\ndemocracy \\\\\n\n"

Moreover, many\nextreme weather events that\noccurred during this period\nhave been attributed to manmade climate change. Now\nis the time for unified, global\ndecisions to be made on tackling climate change.\nTrump has previously\nthreatened to pull out of\nthe UN Paris Agreement,\nratified by Obama. The Paris\nAgreement is an agreement\nwithin the UN Framework\nConvention on Climate\nChange covering greenhouse\ngas emission mitigation and\nadaptation to climate change.\nLeaving the deal would only\nbe an option three years after\nit had been in force, and it\ncame into action last Friday.\nOn top of this, it would take\na year to pull out. America\nis responsible for 13% of\nthe Earth\u2019s greenhouse gas\nemissions, and under the\nParis agreement has agreed\nto cut emissions by up to\n28% by 2025. The legislative\npromises made by the 200\npre-industrial revolution\nlevels). One of the world\u2019s\nbiggest emitters going against\nthis deal would have huge\nramifications.\nBack in May he pledged to\ncut \u201c$100 billion\u201d of climate\nchange spending. In reality\nthe amount the Federacy\nsends to the UN is lower, and\nused to help global communities deal with the effects of\nclimate change. But with all of\nhis sweeping statements, you\nhave to use your imagination.\nCutting all of the Department\nof Energy\u2019s budget, climate\nchange research and funding\nhelping US communities\ndeal with extreme weather\nevents still would not produce\nthe $100 billion in savings\ngovernments that signed the\ndeal are critical to ensuring\nthat global temperatures are\nkept below the 2\u00b0C threshold ( which is 2\u00b0C above\nA Trump Presidency | a new era for\nAmerica... a disaster for Earth?\nT\nhe 9th\nof November saw tears,\ndespair and a whole lot of\nmemes as the results of the\n2016 presidential election\nrolled in. As I woke up to\nBBC alerts of Trump\u2019s win on\nmy phone, I found myself reliving that\nfateful Friday morning in June \u2013 closing\nmy eyes, telling myself it was all a\ndream and everything would return to\n\u2018the expected\u2019 when I checked again.\nHowever, something is different. What\nBrexit would mean to science was,\nand still remains, quite uncertain,\nbut Trump\u2019s science policies are\nquite clear cut and, with Congress\nbacking, likely to be implemented.\nWhether we\u2019ll see a wall built\nwith the Mexico border is still\nto be seen, but that we\u2019ll live\nthrough incredible changes in\nAmerican science policy is almost\nguaranteed.\nAnalyses of Trump\u2019s proposed\nbudget indicate catastrophic deficits,\nwith the government left to figure\nout how to limit spending. Except for\nNASA, Trump has not identified any\nareas of scientific research worth\nsupporting, and most of his answers\nabout science spending focus on a\nneed to make \u2018hard choices\u2019 to meet\nbudget constraints.\nTrump has also shown little to no\nrespect for general scientific findings\nthemselves. He has openly claimed\nSara Hamilton\nThe fate of\nAmerican\nScience\nWhat\u2019s in store for the\nrest of the scientific\nworld?\npromised. In contrast, the\nClinton campaign set out\nclear goals on the issue, and\nClinton pledged to make\nAmerica the \u201cworlds clean\nenergy superpower\u201d.\nTrump has also apparently\nbacktracked on his words\nabout climate. In September\nhe said \u201cthere is still much\nthat needs to be investigated in the field of climate\nchange\u201d, and \u201cwe should\nbe focused on developing\nenergy sources and power\nproduction that alleviates the\nneed for dependence of fossil\nfuels\u201d.\nHowever unclear his inten-tions, the clear anti-climate\nstatements should not be\nignored. Rising seas do not\nnegotiate.\nthat he believes in the link between\nvaccinations and autism and that global\nwarming was \u201ccreated by and for the\nChinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive\u201d. He has pledged to\nreverse Obama\u2019s regulations for climate\nprotection and withdraw from the Paris\nclimate agreement, which became effective five days before the results with the\npromise of finally bringing forth change,\nas well as to get rid of the Environmental\nProtection Agency altogether. He also\nhas claimed that he wants to scrape\nall federal spending on clean energy,\nincluding wind, solar, nuclear power\nand electric vehicles. Furthermore, his\nanti-immigration policies have obvious\nimplications in terms of hindering efforts\nto recruit scientists and STEM students\nfrom abroad to US universities, a key for\nscientific prowess.\nThe optimist in me has in vain been\nsearching for some silver lining in the\nresults of this election but science policies\nare definitely not the answer. There is no\nway around denying that Trump will lead\nto a research effort focused purely on\nshort-term economic interests rather than\nscientific endeavour itself, not to mention\na disaster for the planet, environmentally\nspeaking. Sad days for science it seems.\n//Lizzie Riach\n\n"

What\na trooper!\nThe men\u2019s 1s were fencing\nthat day against Kent,\nlooking for their second win\nof the season after a close\nwin against Queen Mary 1s\n130-125 and the aforementioned loss to King\u2019s. After\nrelegation last year the team\nwere looking to bounce right\nback up to the Premiership,\nso every win is vital. Epee to\nbegin, and with the possibility\nof double hits, getting a large\nlead is challenging. However\nImperial fencers James\nOdgers and Charles Morot\ngot +12 and +13 indicators\neach (the best you can get\nwhen constantly winning is\n+15), leading to an epee\nscore of 45-16. Second up\nwas foil and after a win of\n45-23 Imperial had already\nwon the match in similar\nfashion to Germany against\nBrazil in the 2014 football\nthe Falcons who managed to\nget a touchdown with a lofty\nthrow and catch also gaining\nthe two-point conversion.\nChanges to offense found\nAaron Wilson playing both\nsafety and wide receiver. The\nduo Jason (QB) and Aaron\n(WR) linked up for a long\npassing touchdown, and with\na successful conversion the\ngame was again tied. The\nFalcons\u2019 defense held strong\neven against strong running\nfrom Jorge \u2018HHHOOORRREEE-HHHEEEYYYY\u2019 Ales\n(Rookie Offensive MVP).\nIn the final two minutes\na fumble was recovered\nby Imraj \u2018no groin\u2019 Singh,\nputting the Immortals in\nFalcons\u2019 territory. Immortals\nwere unable to convert, and\nthe game was forced into\novertime.\nThe Immortals started with\nthe ball in overtime. With\nstrong running swallowed\nup by the Falcons\u2019 defense,\nthey went to the air in an\nattempt to score, but to no\navail. The ball was turned\nover to the Falcons\u2019 offense,\nwith their powerful running\nback and twin tight-end formation against the fatigued\nImmortals defense the\ntouchdown was conceded.\nFinal score 16-22.\nA special mention is needed\nfor Henry Turner (Line\nMVP), a player that proved\ndependable even when\nplaying both ways, and out\nof position \u2013 a testament to\nthe Immortal\u2019s spirit.

At the second time\nof asking, dD didn\u2019t quite\nhave enough to win, losing\n8-6 and leaving the team\nwith a game for 3rd\nagainst\nold rivals Cambridge. This\nwas an intense game (as\nexpected), but Cambridge\nare not the all-powerful side\nthey once were.

And rape and\nrelated sex crimes (or at least\nreported ones) have massively\nincreased over the last year.\nAccording to the Met Police\ncrime figures, rape crimes\nhave increased 10.8% in the\nlast year to 5939 and Other\nSexual Crime has increased\nby 10.7% in the last year to\nAn anonymous student shares\ntheir story of the damage done by\nmisconceptions about consent\nto me so it must be fine. This is an issue\nthat hits about as close to home as it can\nget. The number of rapes in Kensington\nand Chelsea increased 26.3% this year\nand the number of other sexual crimes\nincreased 21.5% this year in Hammersmith\nand Fulham. So, in a time where sexual\nviolence is increasing this much in a single\nyear, can we really afford to take a stance\nagainst any action that may work towards\ndecreasing these figures?\nI can understand the reluctance to\nengage on issues relating to consent.\nWithout careful consideration of the\ndiscussion it can feel a little similar to one\nof those awful sex ed lessons from school\nthat always ended up more awkward\nthan informative. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s\nnot important or worth tackling though.\nSociety needs to be talking about consent\nto start tackling this huge sexual assault\nissue and we need to be doing it now.\nThe \u00a35000 consent training bought\nby the Union with College funding has\nreceived such a bashing lately, but I have\nto express my support for it.\nSure, maybe it\u2019ll only reach a small\nhandful of people if not used effectively\nbut even if it makes just one person think\nI\ndon\u2019t know if this is the place to share\nmy story, but with so many sexual\nassault happenings being opened up\nand spoken about, I feel like I should\nsay something.\nThey go to Imperial. They were a\nfriend, someone who provided comfort\nand companionship. I never wanted\nanything sexual to occur between us, and\nI had told them on multiple occasions,\nand every time the subject arose I would\nrefuse.\nAs with many of these stories, my sexual\nassault happened when I was drunk. I was\ndrunk, and as I often did, I went over to\ntheirs because it was a safe place, or so\nI believed, and I didn\u2019t want to wake my\nroommate at the time. I was drunk enough\nthat I drifted in and out of the realisation\nthat my trousers were no longer on me,\nthey were inside me, and then it was over. I\nwoke up, half naked with them beside me.\nUnlike other stories, I didn\u2019t leave straight\naway. I asked them what happened, my\nheart in my mouth, shaking. They told me\nwe had sex. Then I left. I was so scared.\nMy friend, my companion \u2013 were they\nentitled to these things of me? People I\nturned to and asked all told me things that\ndidn\u2019t help: \u201cYou were drunk and went\nover, what did you expect?\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019ve been\nseeing them for a while, it was bound to\nhappen at some point\u201d, \u201cJust...don\u2019t go\nover again\u201d, \u201cThey did nothing wrong\u201d, \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t rape\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s a grey area.\u201d\nNo one helped. No one understood.\nEven now, six months down the line, my\nheart races and my head pounds when\nthey\u2019re bought up in conversation.\nIt\u2019s hard to forgive your closest friends\nfor not understanding. I still don\u2019t think I\nhave. What\u2019s even harder is how I now see\nthat others feel they can treat my body as\njust that \u2013 a body. Now it\u2019s been violated\nand used, I can see just how out of control\nof it I am. Even to the point where a friend\nof mine held me too close for too long and\ndidn\u2019t stop when I told him to let go. It\u2019s MY\nbody. It\u2019s MY choice. Not anyone else\u2019s.\nNever anyone else\u2019s.\n11209 crimes just over the last\n12 months. That\u2019s nearly 50\nreported sex-related crimes\na day in London alone. If\nwe consider the statistic, as\nreported by Rape Crisis,\nthat only 15% of those who\nexperience sexual violence\nchoose to report to the police,\nwe\u2019re looking at a figure of\n114320 incidents. That\u2019s 13 an\nhour.\nWe can\u2019t just close our eyes\nand say it\u2019s not happening\n\\\\ Can we afford\nto take a stance\nagainst any action\nthat may work\ntowards decreasing\nthese figures? \\\\\nWe cannot ignore\nthe consent crisis\nNo one helped.\nNo one understood.\ntwice about whether or not\nthey\u2019re pushing a boundary,\nif it makes just one person\nless aggressive, if it makes my\nfriends half a percent less likely\nto be assaulted on their way\nhome then I\u2019d say the cost, that\nreally is only 30p per student,\nis absolutely worth it.\n\\\\ We\u2019re looking at\na figure of 114320\nincidents a year in\nLondon.
