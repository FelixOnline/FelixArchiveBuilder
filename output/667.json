This is important\nbecause you will be electing those people on\nMonday week to spend \u00a310,000 of the\nUnion's money. So, if you are interested in\nthe survival of R CSU and all its clubs come\nalong and ask nasty questions to see how\nmuch megalomaniacs know!\nAlso coming up in the new future is the Rag\nRace\u2014see me about what that involves and\nthe Swimming Gala, which this year we\nintend to stuff the others. So, if you are at all\ncapable of keeping your head above water for\nfifteen seconds or more do not waste any time\nin chasing down the chief coach\u2014Eric\nDarbyshire to persuade him to let you\nrace\u2014one restriction: you must not be in\nSwimming Club!\nFinally, I should mention the Rag Week (Pt\n2) which is crawling closer and closer.

We are leaving from the Guilds Office\nat 9:00am. On Tuesday, 21, there is aUG M so we need\nas many people as possible there, ie Mech Eng\n220, by 1:00pm. Don't forget the C CU swimming gala on 1\nMarch. Anyone interested should send their\n. names to the Guilds Union Office.\nScout & Guide\nLast weekend we went to Silwell Park Scout\nCamp Site to 'do our bit': our Service Project\nfor this year. This year our voluntary work\nwas to convert an old storehouse to a coffee\nbar.\nWe found th t the club has many potential\ninterior designers and some good painters\nand decorators. We even have several Irish\nelectricians.\nNext weekend (17 Feb) is to the Gower\nPenninsula of South Wales, to go climbing,\nwalking and caving.\nSpike\nPage lOH HH HH HH BH Iolanthe\u2014not to be missed!\nIt is very easy to produce a Gilbert and\nSullivan opera if you are content to let it\nconform to the same old formula that has\nbeen used for the last hundred years. The\nresult is a staid, lacklustre production that\nwould be dull if it weren't for the brilliance of\nGilbert's words and Sullivan's music.\nBut from the very start of Opsoc's production of Iolanthe, it was obvious that\nthey have not been content to conform.\nTheir performance is highly original, innovative and has a polished sparkle rarely seen in\namateur companies.\nThe key to this success is enthusiasm. The\ncast obviously enjoy themselves very much;\nthe male chorus playing upper-class twits\nsipping champagne; the female chorus\nscantily clad fawning over the male chorus.\nAll the male principals sang very well\u2014\ndeserving of particular mention were Richard\nCartmale who sang Tolloller, and Lord\nChancellor Paget for his notoriously difficult\npatter song. Amongst the ladies, Jenny\nFoster shone as Phyllis.\nThe choral singing was always good and\nwell supported by the orchestra. Singers and\norchestra were skilfully conducted by Robin\nFountain.\nThe performance was marred by two\ngroups. The audience (who didn't start to\nrespond to the humour of the show until the\nlast half hour) and the front of house lighting\ncrew (whose comments were audible).\nIn short I recommend Iolanthe unreservedly to anyone. The last two performances are tonight and tomorrow, 7:30pm in\nthe Concert Hall, Union Building. Tickets\n\u00a31.50 (students). _^ . .\nDavid Rowe\nOSC\nThe Overseas Students Committee will be\nholding its elections on Thursday 23 Feb. A nominations list has been put up on the\nUnion noticeboard in the Union Buidling. All\nposts are open for nomination. It is vital that\nall overseas students take part in the elections\nsince the OSC represents the overseas\nstudents at the Union, and looks after their\naffairs.\nJSoc\nWell, there are a number of interesting\nspeakers appearing here this week, starting\nwith Ephraim Potash, who will be speaking\ntonight at the fortnightly Friday Night Meal\non ' A System of Psychology in Judaism'.

    "content": "Letters\n\u2022\nLock Bullshit\n5Dear Pallab\nWith response to Mr Lock's letter in last week's FELIX( Issue 666). I fail to see just what\nis either 'ranting' or 'hilarious'\nabout my factual correction to a completely unbalanced and inaccurate report in London\nStudent. To my knowledge, I have never met the gentleman in\nquestion; either formally or\nsocially, and cannot imagine\nwhat I have done to annoy him.\nI can only suggest that he either\nobjects to my s lagging off of the\ngeneral apathy in RCS or\ndislikes me personally. In either\ncase, I would appreciate his\nopinions on these matters face-to-face as opposed to from a distance.\nMr Lock seems to regard the\nword 'hack' as an insult. In my\nexperience at IC, this expression is used by apathetic nonentities to describe people who\ncan actually be bothered to get\ninvolved with the Unions. I feel\nproud to regard myself as an\nactive member of the Union and\nif he feels this is a bad thing,\nthen that's his loss!\nYours sincerely\nSimon Banton\nBroadsheet Editor 1983/4\nDear Pallab\nHaving just read a quite\nunwarranted personal attack by\nDave Lock on Simon Banton\nand the CCUs (FELIX 666), I feel obliged to make some sort\nof reply.\nSimon's letter to London\nStudent was nothing more than\nan attempt to set the record\nstraight after a remarkably\ninaccurate report on the handover of Mary. He does not\n'rant', but clearly states facts;\nand far from suggesting that he\nis a 'moron', the letter shows\nthat he cares about factual\nreporting\u2014an ethic of journal-ism. I would suggest that, had\nMr Lock's letter, for instance,\nbeen rewritten by the FELIX staff to misrepresent him, he\nmay have had something to say\nabout it.\nOn the more general points of\nMr Lock's letter: he refers to\n' C CU hacks'. As I understand\nit, the word 'hack' is quite\nsimply an insult hurled by\npeople who are not prepared to\ncontribute anything them-selves. I should like to know\nwhether Mr Lock ever reads\nBroadsheet. In my three years\nmi\nPage 2 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HH MH^ Letters-to-f he EyiWr\nexperience of RC SU,I would\nsay without doubt, that Brodsheet has never been better than\nat present under Simon's editorship, and .that its\npopularity has not been higher.\nTo achieve this, Simon must\nwork for hours and hours every\nfor night to prepare each issue.\nThe C CU structure exists at\nImperial College, to provide\ninformal, social student groups.\nIt will only work (and work\nwell) if people take part in the\nRag stunts and Ents trips\nwhich are organised. Presumably, Mr Lock believes that\nthese are also a waste of\ntime\u2014and it is this attitude\nwhich make Imperial College\nsuch a boring place. If he isn't satisfied with the way the CCUs\nare run, why doesn't he come to\naUG M to express his opinions.\nHe is a member of RCS Union\nwhether he likes it or not!\nFinally, mascot ry is in fact a Rag event\u2014Rag involves\nstudents raising money for\ncharity. A violated mascot is\nransomed to the owners, the\nmoney being paid to charity.\nOver the last few years,\nsuccessful mascot ry raids by\nR CSU have resulted in over\n\u00a31,000 (one thousand pounds!)\nbeing paid to various charities.\nDoes Mr Lock agree with\nmoney-raising for charity\u2014or\ndoes he regard this also as 'the\nepitome of mindlessness'?\nYours sincerely\nIan Thomas\nPhysics 2\nDear Pallab\nI was appalled by last week's letter from Mr Lock concerning\nmascot ry. He strikes me as\nbeing just another frustrated\nfreshman who has been rejected\nby his peers and retaliates in the\nonly way he knows how,\nthrough his vitriolic pen.\nWhat Mr Lock regards as a 'ranting letter on mascot ry', appears to me to be a succinct\nletter item ising objectively recent RCS mascot ry activities. I suggest that if Mr Lock has to\nresort to such delightful phrases\nas 'kissing each others arse s' and tired old clich es like ' C CU hacks', then he is the only\n'moron' in the neighbourhood.\nYours sincerely\nMike Munroe\n\u00a35 increase\nin rents\nDear Pallab\nI was somewhat dismayed to\nsee in FELIX666 that the\nLauwerys residence report is\nraising its ugly head again, in\nthe form of the appointment of\na Residential Services Manager\n(albeit under another name). As\nthis was extensively discussed\nlast year, I would like to bring\nup a few points raised then:\nThe Residential Services\nManager was intended to\nstreamline the running^ of\nresidences by, for instance,\ninserting an extra administrative layer between residents and\nEstates ( making repairs\nprospective ly even less\nefficient?), reducing even\nfurther the work specification\nof the housekeepers (who are\nalready overqualified and doing\ntasks much more mundane than\ntheir skills merit) and reducing\nthe role of wardens to a purely\npastoral one (though what\nwould happen if you have a problem outside the hours 9-5 I can't imagine).\nAll this was ( rather tenuously) justified as self\nfinancing if two further\nwardens were shed and their\nflats let to students, and that\nreduced inefficiency would save\nfurther money.\nMay I, perhaps, suggest what\nI consider to be the real reasons\nbehind the appointment of a Residential Services Manager.\nPart of the job description is to\nidentify direct costs of\nresidence. This suggests that a huge burden of costs are shortly\nto be dumped on hall bills (a back of envelope calculation\nlast year suggested at least \u00a35\nper room per week), pricing\nresidence rooms so far above\nthe means of the students that\nwe'll surely see increased\nhardship^.\nIt seems College is bent on\nproducing another monolith\nlike refectories where students\nhave to pay for a system which\nI Friday, February 17, 1984 j does not offer what they want,\nbut over which they have no\ncontrol.\nI could also mention the 'jobs\nfor the boys' aspect, but I think\nthat's so obvious that it hardly\nmerits space!\nIn closing I can only say:\n' WHAT THE HELL IS IC\nUNION DOING ABOUT IT?'\nAre we going to see more\ncrawling to College by ever-so-pretty but totally ineffectual Ms\nLewis? This problem is\nimportant and its up to your\nreaders to get up and complain\nbefore it's too late.\nYours sincerely\nNS Pyne B Eng ACGI\nICU Welfare Officer 1981-2\nCow\nRacks\nDear Sir\nRegarding the red cycle racks\nand the Southside fridges\n( FELIX665). Since the racks are non-inflammable, can I suggest that\nthe racks are placed on the\nSouthside landings. Residents\ncan then tether cows to them,\nremoving the need for\nref ige rated milk.\nThe redundant fridges can\nthen be placed on the Sherfield\nWalkway, for use as cycle\n'moorings'.\nThis will also give passing\nUCL students somewhere to\ncool off.\nYours laterally\nGlyn Garside\nNo Newman\nDear Pallab\nI was dismayed to see that\nlast week you again devoted a page to the immature ranting s of the by now infamous Michael\nNewman. The article is headed\n'Write of Reply', but what\nexactly he is replying to is\nunclear. In fact he has simply\nbeen allowed further space to\npromulgate his views, whilst\nthose who disagree with his\nopinions and/or methods have\nnot had their views featured at\nall, and certainly not in FELIX. Mr Newman claims he is a potential rapist so perhaps he\nshould be locked up for the\nsafety of women at IC. If he has\nsexual hang-ups after an all\nboys school education that's too bad, what makes him (and\nyou) think the rest of us want to\nread about them nearly every\nweek in FELIX?\nYours etc\nJ Martin Taylor\n\u2022 HH MH Mi FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Camborne Weekend\nSport\nby Tim Williams\nLast weekend saw the annual ritual of the\nBottle Match Weekend\u2014the most sacred\nevent in the RS M calendar. Nearly a quarter\nof the student strength of RS M made the epic\npilgrim mage to Cornwall in a fleet of coaches,\nthe journey of a lifetime, an event for all the\nfamily.\nIt is traditional for the squash team to pave\nthe way to victory by blowing their match and\nour brave sacrificial lambs were duly\nslaughtered half an hour off the coaches. In\ntwo thrilling fourth and fifth strings\n(threads?) matches we gloriously snatched a single point to their fifty four. The thirds and\nseconds put up stiffer resist en ce but the tour\nde force was reserved for our first string\n(rope?) who went down in the fifth game tie\nbreak.\nNow it was the turn of the ladies, in the\nCamborne club bar. Provoked beyond endurance by the ungentlemanly conduct of the\nPresident of Camborne School of Mines, one\nof our female supporters feinted with the\nleft, ducked and weaved and went in with a powerful one two combination. At the bell\nRS M took the bout by a knockout and a submission; C SM could only respond with a banning order from the bar. The crowd loved\nit. When the news of the insult to our honour\nwas flashed to the rugby team hotel, there\nwere ugly scenes.\nSaturday morning saw the RS M hockey\nclub in action, continuing a match that had\nstarted the night before in the pubs of\nCamborne. The hangovers were largely\nforgotten as we took to the field with the local\nbookies quoting even money. The unfamiliarity of the all-weather pitch caused many\nproblems for the RS M defence with C SM making rapid breaks to test our goalie. Even\nintense RS M pressure had failed to bend the\nThe Bottle in the Union Bar\nrigging by half time but early in the second\nC SM broke away to score despite the gallant,\nnay heroic, efforts of the defence. RS M were\nrobbed minutes later by the umpire's misinterpretation of the rule book when we\nwere awarded a short corner for a penalty\nflick offence, and again later when their\nkeeper blatantly sat on the ball in the D. Is\nthere no justice\u2014we finished second at the\nfinal whistle. The RS M soccer team were next\nto take the field to defend the cup we won last\nyear. On a pitch sited on the side of a mountain, and in a howling gale, conditions\nwere not good. We elected to play towards the\nsummit in the second half and during the\ncourse of a gritty and hard fought game put\nthe ball in the net twice, but, oh shit-once it\nwas our own goal.\nAnd then to the Bottle Match. This is the\nsecond most venerable varsity match in the\ncalendar and it seemed that half of Cornwall\nturned out to watch\u2014not an inch of touch line to spare. But RS M supporters, outnumbered\nand surrounded by opposition kept up a steady roar of vocal barrage throughout the\ngame to pound the defenders.\nThe match started at a muscle cracking\npace and it was clear that this was to be the\nsurvival of the fittest. The RS M pack held\ntogether well under heavy pressure until the\nbreakthrough came with a brilliantly intercepted pass by the RS M wing three quarter who never looked like being caught as he ran\nseventy metres to score by the posts. The full\nback Kevin Douglas had a magnificent game\nand converted the try with ease, only to\nproduce a superb individual try himself\nbefore half time with a catch on the R SM22,a wearing run, a kick a head and chase to score\nin the corner. Ten nil at half time and the\npressure was really on C SM to fight back into\nthe game.\nThey were worthy opponents and for ten\nminutes attacked the RS M line ruthlessly but\nsolid defence kept them out and then a beautifully worked back row move from the\npack had C SM groping as the backs went\nover for another try. In the final minute, the\nicing on the cake-a nicely worked move\ndown the backs and back again, deft passing\nand solid support gave R SMa fourth try.\nFrom the touch line Douglas booted it over\nto leave us with a memorable twenty nil\nvictory. C SM played well and hard but never\ncapitalised on their penalties or made any\nreally exciting moves.\nBut this was above all a team effort, with\nevery man on the field at peak performance:\nthe hard work and dedication of the whole\nclub throughout the season had borne fruit.\nOur pack held theirs sol ii ly under pressure\nand eventually dominated. They gave good\nclean ball to the backs who never looked\nstoppable. The tackling was effective and\nfearless\u2014altogether an excellent team at its\nbest. The match was televised and we hope to\nget a copy of the video recording for public\nexhibition.\nSo the bottle is back where it belongs in the\nUnion Bar, and if you thought RS M have\nbeen noisy this year, you ain't seen nothing\nyet.\nPage 11\\\n\u201e.uw n trom=i \u2014 \" \" ut ne^o iea on the , i_i_i A Office door by 5pm=|= this evening. = j== \u2022Don't give up if you haven't won this week, as the competition could run for =\ng is another one or two weeks yet. ~%\nV*=T<111 \u2022\n1\n1\n1\n1\nIIII J1111111111111111 Iillllllllllllllllllllllllll!ll ll ll ll ll ll ll ll||||||||||||||||||||||||| j= "

    "content": "Reviews\nSCARF A CIE Scarface (Empire, Leicester Sq) is one of\nthose rare films that will attract both film\nbuffs and the average punter. It is similar to\nthe original 1930's Scarface. but now\nconcerns drug-de a i ers in sunny Florida and\nnot the molls and gangsters like Al Capone of\ngloomy Chicago. On the surface the film tells\nthe traditional story of the rise and fall of a man blasting his way into his share of the\nAmerican Dream. Beneath, however, there\nis a subtle examination of the mobster's personality and the society that permits his\ntype to flourish.\nThe prevailing mood of Scarface is\ncynicism. Everyone is out for themselves, as\nPresident Carter grins inanely on. In 1979\nCastro released many of the worst criminals\nin his jails and mixed them up with the\n125,000 Cuban refugees then being allowed\nby a liberal US regime to sail to Florida and\njoin their relatives. Tony Montana (Al\nPacino) is one of these criminals. He is soon\ninvolved in drug-traffic ing, proving his worth\nin a horrific scene when he and his best friend\nare captured by a rival gang. Montana\nrefuses to reveal where his consignment of\ncocaine is stored, even as the friend is being\nsliced up with a chain saw, like the Sunday\nroast.\nThis scene sets the tone of the film\u2014it is\nviolent, explicit and apocalyptic in its vision of\na totally corrupt society in which Montana\nexcels. 'All I have in this life is my balls and my\nword, and I don't break them for anyone.\"\nScarface is extraordinarily violent, but it is\na quality film in its skilful unravelling of\ns eve al themes in parallel through the plot's steady progression in extremes. The film\nstudies the disintegration of a man, and the\nmotivations beneath his fragile and vicious\npersonality. Throughout the action Montana\nstrives for a 'normal' family life. He wants his\nmother and sister with him, he wants a wife,\nhe wants children, in a kind of sentimental\nLatino manner reminiscent of 'The\nGodfather'. It is this spark of humanity, his\nlove for children, that is his undoing. It also\ndestroys his sister, for whom Montana's FELIXl\nincestuous protective love is as pathological\nas his need for power and success.\nAl Pacino is a small output, high quality\nactor, and it shows. He is superb\u2014dynamic\nand full of menace. The Cuban-American\ndialect is sometimes rather hard to understand and the film is long at 2 j4 hours, but\nScarface is still the best film I 've seen in a long\ntime. The seats at the Empire are excellent\nand in 120mm the final orgy of destruction\nand Montana's spectacular downfall leave\nyou stunned. When you finally stagger out\ninto the grey daylight of Leicester Square, the\nmachine gun fire still ringing in your ears,\nreality can seem a let-down at first. But then\nyou feel relieved that real life isn't like\nScarface. At least, not yet.\nStar 80 (Warner West End) is worth\nseeing for one main reason: Mariel\nHemingway. As her murderer says in one of\nhis first lines: 'She is beautiful.' It was love at\nfirst sight for me. Unfortunately I can't say\nthe same about the film.\nDorothy Stratten. Playboy's Playmate of\nthe Year 1980, was murdered-by her insanely\npossessive husband. The plot is based on\ntheir story, and is reasonably attractive, with\na variation on the theme of Hollywood SexSymbol destroyed by the 'Tinsel Town'.\nDorothy is 'discovered' by a seedy\ncharacter called Paul. At first she is incredibly\nnaive, but she learns to cope with all the\npressures of the glamour world and becomes\nan actress. Paul is terrified of being left\nbehind, and remaining the loser he was\nbefore he met Dorothy. He persuades\nDorothy to marry him, when she doesn't know any better. 'The guy has the\npersonality of a pimp,' advises Dorothy's father figure Playboy boss. 'Get rid of him.'\n'But he's changed those awful clothes he\nused to wear!' cries Dorothy. 'He dresses\nsmartly now!'\nStar 80 is spoilt by its documentary format\n(similar to that in Zelig). We are told from the\nfirst that Dorothy has been murdered and\nthat her husband did it. The interest\ntherefore focuses on why he did it. Then\nFriday. February 17, 1984M MW MM throughout the plot are splattered a series of\n'interviews' with people who knew\nDorothy\u2014these invariably reveal what is\ngoing to happen next. The whole film\ntherefore becomes just a case-study,\ncrippled by interruptions for talk and\nanalysis. It lacks emotional punch or many\nmoments of tension, because for long\nperiods your concern for the fate of the\ncharacters isn't stimulated, whatever else is\nstimulated by all the naked flesh spread\nliberally throughout the film to get the '18'\nrating. If we could have followed the slow\ncracking-up of Dorothy's husband by sticking to the skill of actor, as in Scarface and\nleaving out the analysis, this film might have\nbeen good. 1 suspect Star 80's main\nattraction, like Cat People with Natassia\nKinski, will be Mariel Hemingway, who looks\ngood and acts well. The film itself was a shambles.\nLianna (Screen on the Hill; Screen,\nBaker St) is another rare film\u2014one that\nstrikes a balance between the ghetto of'gay'\ncinema (whose supporters are often as\nlimited and prejudiced ?s those they\ncomplain about) and the superficial sex-plo it ing Hollywood efforts like Personal Best\nthat merely titillate and pretend to be daring.\nLianna is partly about the development of a lesbian relationship and the various responses of one woman's friends, husband and\nchildren. More importantly, it is about self-discovery. Lianna is a 'normal' housewife,\nbaring for her self-satisfied husband and her\nchildren, living in a day-to-day dream. Her\naffair with Ruth destroys all this, and Lianna\nhas to learn to face up to herself and cope\nwith being alone, no longer emotionally\nparalysed and dependent on her family. Gay\ncinema would move into slogans and\npretentious philosophies, but the director\nJohn Sayles keeps the story in real life.\nLianna has a hard time of it, but she copes.\nThe film is attractive because of its calmness\nand the feeling it puts over that this sort of\nthing could happen to any of us, that is, how\npeople respond to drastic changes in their\nlives; without self-pity and a surprising\namount of humour.

    "content": "THE GAS PEOPLE\nUORKING FOR TOMORROW'S UORLD TODAY A(v) If your home uses gas \u2014 and the chances are it\nwill, since British Gas is the largest single supplier\nof heat in Britain \u2014 then you are benefiting from\nyesterday's planning and investment in advanced\ntechnology by the gas people.\nYesterday's research anticipated the needs of\ntoday's customers, and some of the developments\nproduced by the gas people were revolutionary.\nDid you know, for instance, that the gas people\nhelped to pioneer the technology for transporting\ngas across the world's oceans \u2014 gas which would\notherwise be wastefully flared-off? This was done\nby cooling the gas into liquid form at minus 160\u00b0C and carrying it in specially designed tankers. The\ntransportation of LNG is now a major world trade.\nThe gas people also saw opportunities in newly\navailable gas-making feedstocks and developed the\nCatalytic Rich Gas process for making gas from oil,\nrather than coal. Advances like these underpinned\nthe transformation of an ageing industry into a highly competitive and rapidly expanding modern,\nbusiness.\nThe gas people went on to exploit the natural gas\nwhich they had helped to discover around our\nshores. To achieve this they constructed a network of\nunderground high pressure steel pipelines to the\nhighest standards. A great deal of money and technical expertise were expended in devising a means of\ninspecting these pipelines, and a sophisticated\nelectronic and mechanical device called an\n'intelligent pig' was developed. It works inside the\npipeline while the gas is still flowing.\nTOMORROW'S WORLD\nYesterday, the gas people solved what would\nhave been today's problems, and we've given you\njust a few examples. But you may be more interested\nin the work we're doing today to solve tomorrow's. For instance, in readiness for the time when\nBritain's indigenous supplies of natural gas begin to\ndecline, and nobody knows when that will be, the gas\npeople have already developed the technology for\nproducing substitute natural gas from coal. The\nresults of this pioneering work are being viewed with\ngreat interest in many parts of the world. Whichever\nfeedstock is available at a competitive price, however,\nthe gas people intend to have the technology to\nproduce a substitute natural gas from it.\nAnd because gas will still be there for\ntomorrow's customers, the gas people are helping to\ndevelop a new generation of appliances for to-morrow's low-energy homes. They are starting to\napply ways of recuperating waste heat in industrial\nand commercial applications by using gas engine-driven heat pumps. These reverse the normal process by which heat flows from a high temperature\nto a lower and so can consume less energy than they\ndeliver! The gas people are even looking at new ways\nto avoid traffic congestion \u2014 by replacing\nunderground gas pipes without the need for digging\nup the road!\nMuch more is going on besides, so if you'd like to\nfind out about today's high-tech gas industry, write\nto the Public Relations Department, British Gas,\nRivermill House, 152 Grosvenor Road, London\nSW1V 3J L.

As he sipped his strong,\nblack coffee, with his head buried in one\nof the many newspapers he read as an\nexcuse not to listen to Lady Marigold's perpetual chatter, his face darkened.\nFor Lady Marigold's prattling was\nnothing compared to what stared him in\nthe face: 'SKATE SEX SCANDAL. 'Oh\ndamn\u2014this is just what I could do with-out,' he moaned.\nGormless Layon, President of the\nCitizens Association, had also seen\nsomething she could well do without:\nMichael Missile, the sex-crazed ego-maniac and self-publicist and the cause\nof the Baron's displeasure. For it was he\nwho revealed details of some of the lude\nentertainments provided for\nCheapskate's citizens in order to keep\nthem happy despite the unusual conditions which prevailed in the kingdom.\nMichael had entered the Citizens Office,\nsporting his now permanent blush and\ncarrying a few tatty posters advertising\nhis latest crack-pot ideas.\n'Have any more newspapers tele-pr one d?' he asked.\n'No,' replied Gormless as she sulkily\nretreated to her office, slamming the\ndoor behind her.\nSomewhat disappointed, Michael\nannounced to the now empty room:\n'I do like The Daily Smut\u2014it gives\nreally fair coverage that is always so\nbalanced.' And having checked that\nthere was no fan mail for him, he strode\nout of the office and nearly knocked over\nFELIX mma mmm mmm aaaa maa mm Jo Claybrain, an obscure citizen's representative who spent so much time\nin the office. Pushing Michael aside with\nthe physique for which she was noted\nshe strode into the office. She, too, was\nupset by Michael's activities.\n'What right has he got to go around\nupsetting the status quo like that?' she\nthought. 'Poor Gormless must be so\nupset by all those calls\u2014I had better go\nand console her.'\nArmed with an excuse, Jo bounced\ninto Gormless' office only to find it\nempty with Gormless talking to Pristine\nnext door.\n'Oh goodie,' she cried. 'Since she's not\nhere I can get in some practise.' So Jo sat\ndown in the chair, whose ability to rotate\nwas a source of so much delight to her,\nand began to play with the telephones.\n'I 'll soon have all this to myself,' she\nthought, planning her campaign for\nsome years hence. But 'I 'll have to stay in\nwith the self-appointed President-elect,\nthough. Maybe I 'll give him the odd\ncuddle that' ll keep him happy.' However upon hearing Gorm less' voice, she thought better of the idea.\n'Jo, I am VERY busy today,' said\nGormless firmly. 'There are so many\nproblems and I'm not feeling too well so\ncan you PLEASE get out of my chair.' Jo\nsheepishly left the office, sulking and\nwent to sit in her namesake's \u2014Jo\nHenawhatshername's \u2014chair which\nswivelled too. And hardly had she sat\ndown when the office door burst open\nrevealing Sawnoff Levis and the citizens\nchief transvestite, Mike Dress. Panting\nheavily, Sawnoff shouted:\n'Der kon him' s bo in in voided.' Everyone stared. 'Pardon,' said\nGormless.\n'Cheapskate's been invaded by\nJerkskate. Buildings have been\nattacked, treasure stolen...rape, pillage\nand plunder,' cried Mike Dress, as if\nhappy at such a prospect.\nJo Claybrain was only just quick\nenough to grab Gormless before she fell\non the floor.\n'Get some smelling salts...and a stiff\nsherry!'\nIs there anyone who Michael Missile\nhasn't telephoned?\nWill the Baron negotiate on\nsovereignty?\nThe answers to this and more in the\nnext Baron of Cheapskate.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 MB Friday.

An hour and a half later they\ncollapse on the ground, looking considerably\nworse for wear and gasping for cigarettes.\nWhat passed inbetween is less easy to\ndescribe.\nWillis Jackson, fielding a substantially\nmore experienced side, started as favourites,\nand this was reflected in the final score. They\nhad much more possession, and dominated\nmore of the forward play, particularly in the\nscrum s. Southwell, however, were probably\nthe fitter side and were unlucky not to score\nseveral times as they w ree always dangerous\non the beak.

    "content": "Union\nThe general information on page 3\nis the current situation as far as the\nrecent policy statement issued by\nJohn Smith the College Secretary, with regard to the\nmanagement of student residences. A number of queries\nhave already been raised by the\nUnion and other interested\nparties, and the new policy document featured predominantly in\nFELIX last week.\nI feel the College concern with\nstudent staff relations is a valid\npoint and indeed an attempt to\nrectify the situation is occur ing through a number of different\nmeans. I do not feel the situation\nwould be dramatically improved\nby the introduction of academic\nstaff into the penthouse flats in\nSouthside. Neither can I see this\ncausing a vast improvement in\nthe relationship the College has\nwith the South'side Mews\nresidents. The idea of Wardens of\nother residences residing in\nSouthside is ludicrous, especially\nif the new roles are implemented.\nHow can a warden exercise\npastoral care over students if s/ he\nresides possibly a mile from the\nresidence under their care! The\npresent system of only two\nwardens in Southside means a high level of responsibility is\nimposed on the Southside\nwardens but I believe a more\nefficient use of the sub wardens and assistant sub wardens in\nSouthside Halls and even\nLinstead would alleviate much of\n-the pressure and responsibility,\nand thus make the increase in the\nnumber of Wardens a futile exercise. The Staff Warden at Evelyn\nGardens may have many advantages though the reasoning\nbehind the introduction of the\npost it pressures from neighbours, departmental tutors\nand others, is dubious.\nAn improved control of the\nmaintenance and quality of all\nresidences is welcomed, although\nwhether the proposed relationship between the new Manager,\nHousekeepers and Wardens will\nfunction in practice is yet to be\nestablished. I feel a number of\nproblems are likely to arise in this\narea, but this is probably true of\nany new system in its initial\nstages.\nA major concern for students\nin future years must obviously be\nthe financial undertakings in the\npolicy. The objective of achieving\na rent income which will\ncompletely support the\nmaintenance of the basic stock of\nresidence, including loan\nservicing and management costs,\nleaves the future rent levels in a very uncertain situation, although certain subsidies may\nbe permitted from time to time\nunder the University Grants\nCommittee rules.\nIt is extremely unlikely that the\nincreased financial burden on the\nresidence account will enable\nCollege to maintain an increase\nin student rents in line with the\nincrease in the student grants; the\nfinal implication being that\nstudents will suffer from the reorganisation of the 'Managment\nof student residence' if such\npolicies are implemented. The\nrecent statement issued by\nCollege will be under discussion\nat an Open Meeting with John\nSmith, the College Secretary, in\nthe Read Lecture Theatre,\nSherfield Building at 1:30pm on\nThursday 23 February 1984.

    "content": "NEWSPAP\nSMITH: U TURN?\nThere is a chance that the Southside Penthouseflatsmay still be\nused for student accommodation following a change of heart by\nCollege Secretary John Smith. The Student Residence Committee will now take a decision on the matter at its next meeting in\nMay. Mr Smith has also dropped the idea that wardens living in\nSouthside could be in charge of o thc;; evidences some distance\naway.\nIt seems that pressure on Mr Smith following his controversial\npolicy statement, reported in\nFELIX last week, has resulted in\nhim re-thinking his approach to\nthese issues.\nHowever, the central policies\nin the statement are to go ahead.\nThe post of Managing Surveyor\n(Residences) has been created\nand additional costs are to be\ncharged to the residence\naccounts.\nIn the next academic session\nthe wages of the messengers and\nsecurity employees in the Halls,\nand the salary of the Managing\nSurveyor will be a direct charge\non the residence account. These\npotential costs are hoped to be\noffset by an increase in vacation\nletting s income. However the\nfuture implications of the policy\nwith regard to the financial\nburden on residences is\nuncertain, and could result in an\nincrease in students' rents and\nless money being spent on\nresidences.\nCollege still plans to gu ahead\nwith the appointment of a staff\n'super warden' to oversee the\nEvelyn Gardens residences. It is\nfelt that this will help the College\nmaintain a good relationship\nwith neighbours and provide a focal point of security and\nauthority, particularly if the\nCollege acquires additional\nhouses. There is no intention to\nchange the status of the student\nwardens in Evelyn Gardens.\nAlso, the meeting heard that a decision not to renew the lease on\nthe Gerrard Mansions head\ntenancy in the heart of Soho\ntaken two years ago is to be\nreviewed. Following protests by\npresent residents who consider\nthe five flats for two offer\nperfectly good accommodation\nin a unique location the College is\nto attempt to renegotiate the\nlease.\nSee page 4 and editorial for comment.\nRCS Beaver aw\nLSE Mascot Captured\nIn a dramatic dawn raid on Tuesday morning, R CSU captured LSE's mascot, five foot tall Bruce the Beaver. Posing as a group of LSE students meeting for a trip to Edinburgh, the RCS mascot e ers entered\nthe foyer, and distracted the security guard while two members of their\nteam made their way to the room where Bruce was secreted to kidnap\nthe mascot. All five foot of Bruce was hastily stuffed into the back of\nthe getaway car (see photo).\nA triumphant Kangela attracted the attention of the police, but the\nteam were allowed to leave after they had explained their mission.\nLSE students union have asked R CSU to make sure Bruce is fed\nregularly, and have expressed interested in paying the ransom (100\npints of blood and \u00a350 for Rag).\nBruce was too homesick to comment.\nCuts campaigner Hugh Stiles handing a petition of over 1400\nsignatures to Peter Brooke MP.\nNo\nBrooke Shields Policy\nThe parental means test was described as 'illogical' by Peter Brooke\nMP, Under Secretary of State for Higher Education whilst speaking in\nCollege yesterday. Mr Brooke was addressing a well-attended meeting,\norganised by the Conservative Society, on Higher Education.\nIn his speech he outlined the factors to be considered in the future of\nhigher education. He claimed the Government was still adhering to\nthe 'Robbins principle' of access to higher education for all those\nsuitably qualified regardless of means. The value of the full grant, paid\nto those.whose parents' income is below a threshold, had been\nmaintained last year. But he admitted that those whose parents earned\nbetween \u00a312,000 and \u00a318,000 had had a substantial reduction.\nIn answering questions after his speech Mr Brooke agreed with a member of the audience who said that the parental means test on\ngrants was totally unjustifiable. Several searching questions were\nasked, including some by members of the academic staff present. Mr Brooke was able to offer sympathy but very little in the way of\npractical help. . %\nFELIX, February 17, 1984 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 M HH BH Free.'\n\n"

    "content": "Badminton reports return at last after two\nweeks of me leaving them out in fairness to\nother clubs. What a hero. A lot of things have\nhappened since then. Our Knockout Cup\nteam trampled all over QE C and are now in\nthe final against Kings.\nMens 1 need to win all their remaining\nmatches to win the league as do Mens 2 and\nMens 3. This should be no great task,\nhowever.\nThe Ladies are destined to finish near the\nbottom of their league, despite having the\nstrongest team on paper. The trouble is it's totally impossible to get them in the same\nplace at the same time unless the place sells\nalcohol.\nMixed 1 have lost twice to K^i gs, but\nshould finish second and might win if Kings\nslip up.\nMixed 2 had to beat Kings and Guys to wit\nthe league. Guys chickened out of playing us,\nbut Kings beat our out of form team 5-4. We\nshould finish second in the league barring the\nunlikely possibility of us not beating RH C90 in our final game.\nIC2nds 0 Loughborough 2nds9 After last year's comprehensive 9-0 victory\nover Loughborough the IC team were pretty\nconfident about this return crunch game.\nIt wasn't long before the lack of\norganisation became apparent only five out\nof our six players were present so Christian\nand John Sierrs went to get Sean Weir out of\nbed.\nThere's no need for any real comments on\nthe game itself as I think the score is a fair\nindication of the incompetence shown by the\nIC team. One thing to note is that at least\nJohn, Pete, Sean and myself managed to keep\nour horrific performances and embarrassment confined to the grounds of\nIC. Mike Shepherd saw fit to book a court on\nHyde Parkand partnered by Mark McBridge\nmanaged to give disappointing (although\nthat's not really the word I'm looking for)\nperformances to the whole of central\nLondon.\nThe only satisfaction gained out of this\ngame was the thought that the\nLoughborough team must have been up at\n8:00am on a Sunday morning to be here for\n11:30.\nIf you think you can do better and have the\nqualifications required to be in the IC 2nd team ie you can recognise a racket (but don't necessarily know which end to hold) then\nyour presence would Jje welcomed on a Wednesday afternoon at l':00 pm on Linstead\ntennis courts.\nMy apologies to Christian for mentioning\nhis name in this report as he played no part in\nthis pathetic performance, he and the first\nteam should have been playing up at\nLoughborough but that's another story.\nFELixWmmMMnWmmumwMMwmmmm\nCup Semi-Final IC III 2 UC IV 1\n\u2014Now UC them, then you stuff them!\nThe combined delights of a good pitch, a fair\nref and the welcome return of Anton Milner\ninspired IC to cup victory at Colliers Wood\non Saturday.\nUnderstandably, nerves dominated the\nfirst hectic twenty minutes during which UC were unlucky not to score as Paul Simpson\nlived up to his reputation as the most\nimproved keeper in IC with several\nspectacular saves.\nHowever, having cleverly allowed UC to\nrun themselves stupid and get depressive\nabout their finishing, the IC midfield machine\nof Snedker, Milner, Wadsworth and\nWhitehead then began to get to grips with the\ngame. Shortly after the break IC finally\nunlocked the UC defence with their secret\nweapon. Captain Chris Gordon stormed up\n~ *W from his usual sedentary position in\ncci:.>al t.w fc n ce, exchanged a 'one-two' with\nMilner and i as J on the chance for Dave\nWadsworth who converted effortlessly with a cunningly disguised short (mis kick). An intense period of IC pressure followed,\nduring which Torsten's goal was disallowed.\nThe pressure finally paid off when Steve\nCoussens, about to squander his second good\nchance of the game had the ball clumsily\nhand balled away from him. Tension\nmounted again but Anton, cool as a cucumber, aimed his penalty low, hard, left\nand scored in the top right-hand corner.\nFurther conversational structuralism from\nMark within earshot of the ref all but earned\nhim his second booking of the week but\nfurther drama ensued as both Wadsworth\n(scythed) and Milner (seizing up with old age)\nbecame substitution candidates.\nSubstitute Horse in fact came on three\nminutes into injury time and saw UC score\nthe obligatory consolation goal. In the\nabsence of a team list I would like to praise\nthe solid defensive work of Bryce\nGoldsbrough, Dave Kellend, John Barden\nand also Dave Keene who came along to\nwatch and ended up running the line.\nPS: I'm sorry the report's a bit vague but I was still pissed when I wrote it.\n-Flash\nIC ran onto the pitch full of energy and will to\nwin, but after realising how big the\nopposition was, they soon realised that a difficult match was ahead. Sidcup had a well\ndrilled pack of fore wards( most about 16\nstones) and in the first half, breaks by their\nbacks led to two tries. Although the game was\nplayed in a friendly atmosphere the second\nhalf saw the departure of four players due to\ninjury (two persons each side), but although\nthey never looked like overhauling the\nopposition IC remained persistent and after\nsome good work in the fore wards followed by\nsome penetrating running in the backs, they\nwere unlucky not to salvage some points from\nthe game.\nAfter the match, due to Capital buses\nkeeping up their usual standards IC had to\nleave just as the opposition were buying them\na jug, so James Rymer was left to polish it off\non his own\u2014hope you enjoyed it James.\n- IC 660 Kings 703\nOnce upon a time there were 4 IC pistol\nshooters were ventured up to Oxford with 4\nKings' pistol shooters. Their aims? To destroy\nthe wicked Oxford University team (for a second time).\nBut behold there was a new member on the\n'. Oxford team. A wicked witch, who wore a short leather dress and fish net tights. She cast\na spell over most of the London team (the\nmale part). We were powerless, and lost (by\n13 points).\nOnce upon another time (Wed 8) 4 It pistol shooters battled with 4 Kings pistol\nshooters at IC's range. Careful pre-match\nanalysis and strategy suggested a close\ncontest. It wasn't. We were wiped.\nOur star shooter (from Physics 3) shot like\na Wally. We now believe the Kings team must\nhave no bb led him (ar d the rest of our team\nfor that matter!).\nTop score from 1C was by Miss NJ Hallows, the rest of the team wish to remain\nanonymous.\nFriday, February 17, 19841 \\ Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Jitorial\nResidences\nAs a result of pressure from the Students Union, College Secretary\nJohn Smith is holding an open meeting next Thursday in the Read\nLecture Theatre, Sherfield, next week to explain College's reason\nfor implementing the policy on The Management of Student Residences. The policy document is the end result of the Report on\nStudent Residence at the College by John Lauwerys, published last\nyear. At the moment student residences receive an effective subsidy\nfrom central College funds. The residence account does not have to\nbear the cost of external maintenance, re decoration, the messenger\nsystem and administrative costs. The aim of the policy is to identify\nthese costs and shift them to the residence account. The College\nhope the residence account can bear the burden of these costs\nthrough the Summer Lettings Scheme when residences are let out to\ntourists during the summer. The tourist trade can fluctuate and if\nthese costs cannot be met over the summer its going to mean large\nrent increases for students well above the annual grant increase or a drastic reduction in services and the maintenance of residences.\nThe need for efficiency is clear, however the proposals are I feel a false economy. Accommodation is one of the prime factors a prospective student considers when he decides which university to come\nto. The more talented students are usually able to pick and choose\nwhich university they go to. Imperial College is certainly going to lose\nout if students see that it offers the most expensive and inadequate\nac como dati on around.\nThe importance of the meeting on Thursday cannot be over\nemphasised. It is not about porn, or Nicaragua, it is about an issue\nwhich affects you directly\u2014the place you ii ve in and the rent you pay\nfor it. It is essential that students make their opinions felt in an\nattempt to effect some change in the policy.\nElections\nIf election candidates want publicity in time for papers down (next\nFriday 5:30pm), camera-ready artwork must be submitted to the\nFELIX Office by Tuesday 10:00am.( This means any phototypesetting required must be submitted today.) Elections committee\nhave decided that printing of all publicity is restricted to the FELIX\nOffice and the Union Office (for Gestetners). This means no badges,\nphotocopying, dye lines etc. I understand that a candidate has\nappealed against the decision and Elections Committee are meeting\ntoday to review that policy.\nCredits\nLynne James, Jon Jones, David Jones, Hugh Southey, Tony Joyce,\nJ Martin Taylor, Tim Noyce, David Rowe, Peter Rodgers, Michael\nNewman, John Scott, Diane Love, Jon Burgess, Pete Hobbis, Matt\nFawcett, Ulysses, Juvenal, the Sherfield Mole, Tony Atkins, Guy\nRiddihough, Dave Parry, Nick Thexton, Pete Coleman, Mike Smith,\nHugh Styles, Robin Graham, Jen Hardy-Smith, Maz and Pete.\nPallab Ghosh\nIn response to several requests, this week's puzzle is\na chess one for which I am once more indebted to\nAnatoly. It is not so difficult that only chess experts\ncan solve it, so even if you don't know too much\nabout chess, you may still be able to work it out.\nThe problem is for White to move and win.\nGood luck, everyone.\nSolutions, criticisms, comments to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday please. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike for the randomly selected winner.\nLast week's solution\nThis was fairly easy. If you write out all the possible\ncombinations, you will find that there are nine,\nknowing that Alan took at least one shield. With each\nstatement you can eliminate combinations, eg you\ncan eliminate the combination '1,4,5,6' after Barry's first statement, because it is the only comb in at in where he takes four. If you repeat this process for the\nwhole conversation, only two combinations remain\nafter Barry's second statement, namely 1, 3,5, 7 and\n1, 3, 4, 8. Since you are given that Chris took two\nmore shields than Barry, the only combination\nwhich satisfies is therefore 1, 3, 5, 7.\nOf twenty correct solutions, Chris Dunn of Maths\n1 was the randomly selected winner and can collect\nhis \u00a35 cheque courtesy of Mend-a Bike from the\nFELIX Office after 1:30pm on Monday.\nMany thanks to whoever it was who dropped a crossword into my box during the week. Could they\nplease give me a name or pseudonym sometime.\nThanks also to Sharpshooter for the football puzzle\nas well; I'd be grateful if s/ he could get in touch\nagain.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince ConsortRd, SWJ\nTel 01-589 5111 ext n1048 or internal 2881.

    "content": "Ents off Freebics on\nCouncil got off to a flying start on\nMonday when Union Administrator Mrs Hardy-Smith had the\nmisfortune to fall under a black-board. Christine Teller rushed\nto her aid and was just able to\nmake out a hoarse whisper giving\nthe combination for the Union\nSherry Safe. Medicinal Tio Pepe\nwas administered and the real\nbusiness of the day could begin.\nConcern was expressed that the\nEnts Committee lost \u00a31,500 on\nthe Christmas party at the end of\nlast term. The party featured\nseveral bands, a bar extension,\ndisco, etc, but was badly\npublicised resulting in a disaster-ou sly low turn-out for the event.\nSome Council members expressed\ndissatisfaction about the general\nrunning of Ents and the type of\nevents organised. It was decided\nthat Ents should not book any\nfurther events until their affairs\nhad been investigated by Steve\nBishop, an Ordinary Member of\nCouncil.\nCouncil also considered the\nRodgers Report on Conferences.\nThe motion on the NUS conference passed at aUG M last\nterm set up a committee to\ninvestigate expenditure on conferences by ICU. Only three\nmembers of the eight member\ncommittee bothered to turn up,\nprobably because the proposer s of the U GM motion had not\nchecked that they were actually\nprepared to take part. In the\nevent the committee recommended that ICU should\ncontinue to send people to ten\nconferences connected with\nstudent union affairs, and should\nsend observers to the next NUS conference. In considering\nIN COST, the International\nConference of Students in\nScience and Technology, to be\nheld this year in Helsinki from 1\nto 7 Apr the committee made\nno re co: \"Nation due to\n' insufficient. creation'.

The return airfare\nto Helsinki (economy ticket) is\n\u00a3155 per person.\nSouthsidc\nSecurity\nIt was revealed this week that\nelectronic locks will be fitted to\nthe entrances of the Southside\nHalls of Residence by the start of\nnext term. All residents will be\nissued with magnetic cards and a code number to allow them\naccess to the Halls during the\nnight when the doors are locked.\nIt is hoped that this will tighten\nup security in the building in the\nlight of recent thefts in Southside.\nProfs\nPledge\nA number of academic staff have\nsigned a 'peace pledge' stating\nthat they will never directly u?e their technical and scientific skills\nfor the furtherance of the nuclear\narms lace. At a meeting in\nCollege last Thursday eight\nmembers of staff including Prof\nKibble, head of the Physics\ndepartment, signed the pledge\nand explained their reasons for\ndoing so in front of an audience\nof about fifty students.\nNew Pro for IC\nImperial College is to have a new\nPro Rector, External Development. Professor Charles Phelps,\ncurrently Principal of Chelsea\nCollege, has accepted the new\nappointment.\nHis main responsibility will be\nlias on between IC and industry,\nand the promotion of research\ncapabilities.\nProf Phelps became top man at\nChelsea in 1981, straight from a career in Academia. He set up the\ndepartment of Biochemistry at\nLancaster in 1975 where he was\nresponsible for research grants\nworth nearly \u00a3100 000.\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1934,\nPhelps graduated with a first in\nBiochemistry from Oxford in\n1957. He went on to gain a DPhil from the same University\nand then moved to Bristol as a lecturer until 1975.\nHis job as principal of Chelsea\nCollege is to disappear when the\ncontroversial amalgamation with\nKings and QE C takes place, later\nthis year. Prof Phelps, who is\nmarried with two children,\nexpects to take up his new\nappointment towards the end of\n1984. ,\nElection loophole plugged\nFind another way to cheat!\nElections committee have\ndecided that printing of all\npublicity for the forthcoming\nsabbatical elections is to be\nrestricted to the FELIX Office\nand that Gestetnering may only\nbe done in the Union Office. The\nFELIX Editor and the Hon Sec\nmust be informed if Sherfield\nfacilities are to be used. Any\nother printing facility, within or\noutside College may not be used,\nsince it is felt that access to such\nfacilities often depends on\npersonal contact and may give an\nunfair advantage to a candidate.\nIt is understood that one of the\ncandidates has appealed against\nthe ruling and that elections\ncommittee will be meeting to\nreconsider their decision.\nFollowing \"the recent elections\nfor departmental representatives\nthe following people were\nelected:\nThose elected unopposed were:\nAero Eng: Duncan Moore\nElec Eng: Roger Preece\nGeology: Rebecca Dazeley\nMaths: Roy Hepper\nMech Eng: Mark A Harris\nThose elected who were opposed:\nChem Eng: Juliet Varley\nChemistry: Nina Hallows\nCiv Eng: B Guillaume\nDoC: Robert Shiels\nLife Science: M Ibba\nMet & Mat Sci: RJ Weaver\nMRE: Charlie Peachy\nPhysics: A Belk\n'A United Ireland is the only solution'\nClive So/ey\nFELIX OTB\nAt Debsoc's Tuesday debate on\nNorthern Ireland the motion\n'This house believes that a United\nIreland is the only solution' was\ncarried by sixteen votes.
