Derek\nWade, competing for U.L. against\nCambridge University and Loughborough College, cleared 23 ft. 2} ins.\nin the long jump to shatter the old\nrecord of 22 ft. 3y ins. He had previously bettered this latter distance in\ncompetition for his club, but club performances are not recognised as College records.\nThe other records were achieved in\nthe match between U.L. and AAA on\nWednesday 17th. In the 440 yards,\nRichard Beck ran a very good race to\ncome in second, behind Olympic\nfinalist Tim Graham, in the time of\n48.9 sees. (Graham did 47.6)\u2014improving the record by a fifth of a second.\nHe is now only 0.4 sees, below the\nU.L. record set up in 1951 by Olympic and Empire medallist Arthur\nWint.

All the posts with the exception of publicity officer, are being directly contested by at least two\ncandidates.\nThe sole heir to the publicity officer's position was also on view,\nthere being a possibility that candidates for other posts might stand\ndown for his, if defeated. The proposal speeches were all much like\none another\u2014\" I propose so and so because he has done this, that and\nthe other, and is a good Guildsman.\" To some members of the\naudience this was not enough, and there was much cheering (and\nbooing) of Civil Engineering's candidates. Pete Casson and Phil\nMarshall both delivered proposals for the post of president, their hopes\nbeing respectively, Frank Morris and Chris O 'Donnell.\nFrank Morris is a second-year electrical engineer. He has been his\nyear's representative on Guilds Union\nCommittee, organised this year's Carnival Football Pool and found time to\nwork on FELIX.\nHe says that his policies are based\non the greater involvement of the\nGuildsmen\u2014both Undergraduate and\nPostgraduate, especially the latter\nwho a present show little interest in\nthe Union. After his year on Guilds\nCommittee he has formulated plans\nfor its streamlining so that less time\nis wasted on trivialities.\nChris O 'Donnell is also in his\nsecond year, this time in the Mech.\nEng. Dept. He too has been a year\nrep, and was Pubilicity Officer for the\nCarnival Folk Concert besides being\non Selkirk Hall Committee.\nHe is worried by the average\nGuildsman's lack of a sense of belonging to Guilds Union. He thinks\nthat a series of \" Guilds Nights \"\u2014\nsimilar in concept to the Mines\nNights at the Prospect\u2014could bring a feeling of identity with Guilds.\nThe proposal speeches on their\nbehalf were frequently drowned, by\nuproar : Marshall's being unusual in\nthat it was (for \"Marshall) serious.\nThe two vice-presidential candidates\nwere Dermot Corr and Dick James\nand a good deal of questioning arose\nover whether or not their proposer s were fingering the microphone.\nAs time went by the audience\ndwindled, the speeches got shorter,\nand by 2.30 when the hustings ended\nRoom 220 was less than half full\u2014\nno doubt due to exam fever.\nFRANK MORRIS\nCHRIS O 'DONNELL\nFilm Festival Flops\nThe Film Festival was the Flop of\nCarnival week. Basing their estimates\non last year's audiences of 250 at the\nevening showing, and 450 at the\nmidnight showing, the organisers took\nelaborate precautions. Ten people\nturned up to the first showing and\nabout seventy to the second.

In fact it would be true to\nsay that the whole show was primarily\nsex-oriented. This apart, it was\nalso forty-five minutes of very professional music.

They then persuaded him to come for a car\nride by using their vibrant Guilds\npersonalities.\nHis manager was approached for\na small donation to Carnival for\nthe return of his star. And in a short\nwhile all concerned in the escapade,\nincluding Mr. Castle, met up at St.\nGiles Circus where Roy was hurried\nout of the getaway car\u2014by members\nof his fan club ?\nHis manager, by now almost hysterical with delight at seeing his lost\nproperty, asked for the key to the\nhandcuffs before parting with his\nfiver.

What a party!\nThe Tizard staircase party, of a fortnight ago, which came under the\neagle eye of its Hall commit tte e, must\nhave become one of the most expensive private parties at IC. Before the\nfire alarm was set off, the party's cost\nwas about \u00a340, for drinks. The total\nhas now been more than doubled, due\nto a lavish series of fines. The four\nhosts elected to pay \u00a310 each rather\nthan spend a week out of hall, but this\nwas not the end of the financial\ntransactions. As a result of his\nwriting a letter to Dr. Cameron,\nTizard Warden, the man who first\npressed the alarm button, has now\nbeen saddled with an even larger fine.\nIt all goes toward the Muscular Dystrophy fund.\nPROTEST!\nThe fines were not paid without a fight. Tony Duke and Rex Lowin were\nasked to intervene, but despite a heart-searching series of talks with\nthem the Hall committee stood un-shaken on its decision.

    "content": "6 FELIX Our beloved President celebrates the 10th anniversary of the\nopening of his natural habitat at\u2014the Union bar, Jan. '67.\nTHAT WAS\nby Colin Hanson\nIt's over and we let it\nroll\nRCS Union meetings which became more sober, argumentative and in qi i orate than IC Union meetings. Nov. '66.\nIt is very tempting to make this\ninto an article which picks out all\nthe many faults in the methods\nand people of the past year's Union. Instead in this newspaper\nlet us look at what has been new\nthis year.\nA situation which has been new\nin its imminence if not in essence\ncentres on the Union fee increase.\nWith the Union's share of the Sport's Centre pawned and investments\nrealised to an extent which arouses\nconsiderable concern, this was a year\nfor economy wherever possible. At\nthe beginning of the Christmas vacation the prop oie d increase in the\nUnion fee was passed around the\nCouncil table to give them courage\nto approve estimates of Union expenditure which included np great measure\nof economy. By Christmas it was becoming less certain that the fees increase would be forthcoming and\nnothing more had been heard of the\n\" loan\" which had been discussed\nwith Sir Patrick Linstead\u2014thank\ngoodness no one proposed that the\nextra money be spent in advance.\nStill the spending spree con r in u es; it\nwas discovered that Student Finance\nhad about \u00a31,000 to*spare and instead\nof deciding to save the money, a scramble developed to see who could\nget the most of it. At no time has\nthe need for e cd no my been pushed\nby Council, and although there is no\nobvious waste of hundreds of pounds\nthere have been various stupidities\nwhich have lost, altogether, a similar\nsum. There was the unwanted Scrutiny which reached the proof stage\nand was then allowed to die.\nEven now there is no degree of certainty over the increased Union fee.\nThe Dept. of Education and Science\nhas been antagonistic to London\n\" students' luxury\" and if it is not\nincreased this year it may be another\nfive years until it again becomes pos-sib le. Further, if the College is forced\nto disclose its accounts, it may well be\nreluctant to advance loans and various other fringe benefits.\nLEST WE FORGET\nNew. to IC this year were Student\nHouses ; the scheme for these grew,\nfrom an idea hatched in the vicinity\nof the Tizard sub-warden's flat, to\noccupy hours of Council's valuable\ntime. Throughout last term new reports (fashioned out of old ones) appeared on the feasibility, desirability\nand expense of these new mini-halls,\nwhich occupied the Union chatter for\nsome time and even aroused a controversy (albeit a mild one) over their\nrunning. Pete Finch, who was already\nin danger of being submerged by the\nvarious odd-ends turned over to the\nWelfare Officer, and Rex Lowin have\ndone some commendable work on this\npossibility\u2014let us hope that during\nthis academic term and the long (for-get ful) vacation the proposals are not\nallowed to slip along the way on\nwhich so many other projects have\ndisappeared.\nBUtr*\u2014which proves that there's no such thine as har fT K \u2022_\u2022 . - ..\npublicity when it comes to raising sales.

    "content": "The role\nAdministrator\nand Social\nDiplomat\nby TONY DUKE\nThe Editor of FELIX has asked me\nto write an article on my views of the\nIC President. Perhaps this is some\ntrick to twist my words, or yet again\nbe misrepresented! Obviously, as the\ntime is drawing near for the highly\ncriticised Joint Council meeting decision for next year's post I shall have\nto be a little conservative in what I say. Modesty prevents me from\ndescribing an ideal President! Every\nPresident will approach the task in a different way; all I can really mention\nare my views and the mistakes I 've\nmade and equally the mistakes that\nmany other members of this Union\nmake every year.\nTony Duke\nFirst, what is the President of Imperial College Union? He is not really\na representative of Imperial College\nstudents; this would be impossible,\nthere being so many different views\nexpressed by so many different organisations within the Union structure.\nNeither is he a representative\" of the\nmajority of students because, in fact,\nthe majority are apathetic towards\nUnion activities and appear to want\nto remain in their shells or to stick\nto their already flourishing and possibly more realistic life away from the\nbounds of this institution. He can\nmore aptly be described as a figure-head, an administrator and co-or dina tor. He is the chairman of Council,\na representative group of students\nelected by the students, which, as a unit is meant to govern the finances\nand the discipline of the students,\nlook after their welfare and be responsible for the Union buildings.\nThe President is also a diplomat in\nhis relations with the Governors, and\nAcademic and Administrative staff\nand with external bodies. He is also\nresponsible for any actions of the\nstudents where the name of the College and Union is involved.\nI have given you an outline of the\nduties of the President, now what\nabout the manner in which these\nof The President A representative of the students\nImperial College Union is dead !\nLong live Imperial College re fec tories!\nThis sad demise was un mourned, even un remarked, by the majority of\nits erstwhile members. Even the precise date of decease is vague. The\nCollege authorities, however, were\nmore observant and in 1960 the then\nRector and the I.C. Governors published an epitaph.\nIn their long-term plan for the\ndevelopment of residence and other\nstudent amenities they envisaged a geographical spreading of the student\nareas. As a result, South Side has\nluxurious lounge, refectory and bar\nfacilities; the new central College\nblock will also have refectory and\nlounge spaces. Lavish provision is\nand will be made for the feeding,\ndrinking and lounging of large numbers of students as individuals. But\nno provision has or will be made for\nthe existence of students as a Union.\nLike an ancient Pharoah in his tomb,\nthe corpse of I.C. Union will be provided with all possible splendour but\nno route back to life.\nIt would have been possible for a vigour o us and informed Union to\nresist its own dismemberment; instead a bureaucratic and undemocratic\nUnion provided the perfect evidence\nof its lifeless ness in the shape of its\nPresident.\n\" leaders instead\not representatives\"\nI.C. Presidents\u2014and they are proud\nof it\u2014are on closer and more intimate\nterms with the Rector than with their\nown Union members. They spend a great deal of time in social and administrative contact with the Rector,\nbut are too busy to go round the labs,\ninformally meeting and chatting to\nstudents. Indeed, in so much contempt\nare the students of l.C. held by their\nby FRANK FUCHS\nleaders that they are not even allowed\nto directly elect them, this being left\nto Council.\nThe whole legal structure of the\nUnion ensures that most student officers are merely administrators. The\nsystem practically ensures that an\nelitist philosophy is perpetuated. This\nphilosophy regards student office as\na \"valuable experience\" V'h ich is\n\"character-building\" and fits the\nholder for a future managerial career.\nOfficers are elected, not because they\nare democratically representative, but\nrather because they are \"good chaps,\"\nor at best \" efficient.\" Therefore the\nelectorate never learn to appreciate\nthe purpose of democracy, are unskilled in its use. and easily talked\nout of wanting more. They elect\nleaders, instead of representatives, and\nreward self-interested ambition instead\nof community service.\nA democratic Union should be just\none facet of students' total involvement in the life of I.C. Learning is\nnot just a process of memo rising facts\n-that can be done by a parrot. It\nshould be a two way relationship; I.C. is one of the few University colleges\nwhere students are content to have no\nsay in what they are taught, how they\nare taught and by whom they are\ntaught. Many of the staff here are\nfalling over themselves to offer this\nkind of involvement. But the all-per-va sive elitist philosophy, reinforced\nby the structure and officers of the\nUnion, make us too scared to accept.\nWhat hope is there for the Union to\nemulate Lazarus? A little, perhaps.\nThrough a greater awareness of the\npossibilities of change in the academic\nset-up at I.C., students may also come\nto appreciate the faults in their\nUnion.\nIt is Rill possible that the Union\ncan change the development plan. We\nmight still negotiate for a single\ncentral Union building which would\nFrank Fuchs\nbring scattered students together into\na corporate identity, instead of further\ndividing them. But these negotiations\nwould have to be carried out by a President who spoke for his members\nand not merely for himself.\nApathy is not the fault of the stu-dent. It is merely an expression of his\nunconscious acceptance of the death\nof the Union. If, however, the Union\nwere to be democratically active in\nacademic and welfare matters his\ninterest might be re-awakened.\nIn this context democracy firstly\nmeans conveying information -to the\nmembership. Even the news of such\nserious matters as the College development plan and the Parking control scheme has filtered slowly to\nCouncil and too late to members.\nSecondly democracy means frequent\nUnion meetings. If, as during this\nyear, a quorum requirement of 300\nmeans that 280 people sit impotently\nin the Concert Hall and are then\nsent away, then the quorum must be\nreduced to meet the average at ten dance. Thirdly, democracy means a sabbatical President who can spend a full-time year serving the welfare of\nhis members. And fourthly, it means\na President who is elected by universal\nsuffrage, having proclaimed his policies and not his beer-capacity.\nduties are tut nile d. this depends entirely on his character and persona-lit y. Ideally he should be objective,\nperceptive, discriminating, have a single-m'indedness of purpose, a disciplined mind and a dominating persona-lit y.\" Many of you will disagree on\nthese points. Some of you would like\nto see a politician as President; 1 can\nassure you that this would be fatal;\nit implies an immediate bias which\nwould unnecessarily annoy the other\nparties and have no real bearing on\nthe aims of 1C Union. Many would\nprefer a totally unbiased, impartial\npuppet. In my view we need someone\nwho is proud of Imperial College and\nall it stands for willing to stick his\nneck out and able to face inevitable\ncriticism.\n1 am very proud of Imperial College and support all that enhances its\ngood name: thus 1 usually have more\nsympathy with the sports side than\nwith political stirring, and the alleged\n\" shows of solidarity\" which have\nbecome a feature of student life.\nObviously, to embark on a job of\nthis type you need to be an extrovert.\nIt is essential to be friendly and helpful but at times to be aggressive and\nshow disapproval. I started the year\nwith the idea that everyone should\nhave a free hand. I found this to be\nuseless and time-consuming. The\nPresident must have his own ideas\nand principles, and at times must\nmake a stand. 1 found that I disliked\nthe narrow-minded, perpetual-student\npoliticians .and admired the hardworking cheerful types who, while\nholding no particular office in the\nUnion, give freely of their time and\neffort.\n1 have also been asked to discuss\nthe present method of electing the\nPresident. From what I have already\nsaid it should be apparent that an\nintimate knowledge of a candidate's personality and ability is essential.\nThis can not be obtained by 3,600 students nor by 300 attending a Union\nMeeting\u2014assuming it were quo rate. The people most HKeiy to nave tms\nknowledge are those directly concerned with the running of the Union,\ni.e. the Council, who in the main are\nthe elected representatives from all\nsections of the Union. One must also\nremember that many active^ members\naround the Union are not concerned\nwith attending Union meetings.\nTherefore in a Union of our complexity and size, I suggest the present\nsystem is by far the more sensible.\nTo anyone contemplating this seat\nof honour and target of abuse, ask\nyourself if you have the stamina, efficiency and determination to last the\nyear and are you fortunate in having\na first-rate sympathetic supervisor?\nIn conclusion, with a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at yourself you cannot fail! I have enjoyed\nthe year immensely but contrary to\nrumours I am not offering myself for\nre-election; I am standing as the\nPresident of ICWA with full Union\ncontrol by \" eye-lash flutter\" and\ncorridor gossip.\n\n"

    "content": "COUNCIL MEETING; Monday's Council meeting was notable for the absence of discussion of Student Houses, but news of these is expected soon. The Car Parking Report provided some lively discussion. The committee has objected to Westminster City' Council's proposal to instal parking meters in this area, but Frank Fuchs was not satisfied with the action taken by the action taken by the students on the committee. It was decided,, however, that negotiations., should continue for1030,0 of the available so aces to be reserved for students. Books tall \u2014 Council was presented with along report on the Books tall, This concerned the proposals M rA.G. Quin see, the Haldane Librarian and the counter proposals of the books tall committee. Mri^ u in see's proposals suggested that the Union& College should cease to run the books tall. The committee points out that the books tall has been restricted and notable to grow with the college. However, when it moves to the college block, facilities and service will improve vastly. Cou c nil unanimously approved the Committee's proposals. It also agreed to the changing of the name to' Imperial College Bookshop' \u00bb\nAt this point Mr Fuchs asked Council if anyone had considered the implications to the Union of moving the Bookshop and refectories to College block, This guest ion was considered irrelevant to the Books tall Committee*s report. He also wanted Council to decide its philosophical attitude to the Parking question. The Treasurer's report passed with little comment. It appears that the Union will have a deficit of between \u00a3500 and \u00a31000 at the end of the year. The exact figure cannot be p;i ven because of uncertainties in the spending of various bodies, especially the clubs committee. Miss An nHay asked Council for agr nat of one term's rent in lieu of expenses( a similar system, but with different amounts involved, is used to pay the six Executive Corn mitte members' expenses). This was discussed at some length and was eventually referred back to the IOWA committee. T1 zard Punish rne nt A carefully worded motion concerning the recent punishment of four Ti zard Hall residents was proposed by Mr Roberts. It was pointed out that Council had no jurisdiction over the Halls of Residence Committees, but the motion merely expressed its consternation about the incident and asked for a review of Hall Discipline proceed ure s. The motion was eventually amended to delete there cue st for a review of discipline and then it was dropped on a proposal by Mr Reich.A motion deploring the behaviour of the Entertainments Committee was defeated at the end of a two hour meeting.

    "content": "4 FELIX\nCEDITOR'Somme nt CARNIVAL\nThe big success of the year !\u2014Carnival\u2014a Carnival which has\nproduced a dramatic increase in profits from a miserable \u00a3800 last\nyear to \u00a33,500. This beats the previous record profit by 50 per cent.\nCarnival Organiser Jerry Stockbridge can only be praised for taking\non at the last minute such a large task and producing such a success.\nAs Stockbridge says, the job in Carnival each year must be to surpass the previous year's profit and there is no reason why, in the next\nfew years and with the whole-hearted support of each undergraduate\nat I.C., we cannot top \u00a310,000. Particularly, we should concentrate\nour efforts into the first term, when each student is fresh, each has\nplenty of time and when enthusiasm is running high.\nPRESIDENTS\u2014PRESENT AND FUTURE\nThis year again, the Union has continued to be run by a self-formed elite. The Executive members are elected not for their vision,\ntheir awareness of the average student condition, their determination\nin improving or upholding this condition , nor are they elected for\ntheir vision of I.C., of where I.C. should go or what it should become.\nOur Executive is elected on the whole, to preserve the status quo.\nUndoubtedly it is the role of the President and the Executive to act\nas social representatives and to run the day by day administration of\nthe Union. It is also their role, however, to represent student opinion,\nor even in fact to lead student opinion.\nTony Duke and his Executive have fulfilled the first role, and\noften admirably. This is the role they themselves see and in these\nterms Tony Duke has been a success as President. He has definitely\nbeen a greater success than some of our previous Presidents in recent\nyears. Molam, McBain and, to a lesser extent Roberts have all been\nsuccessful and have worked hard in their way\nThey have however failed in their second role. In particular\ntheir efforts to suppress any active opposition to the government, on\nthe overseas student's fees increase was tawdry and depressing.\nCavanagh as President of RCSU has been far more successful\nin this second sphere. He alone on the Executive stood out against\nthe overseas students' fees increase. It was he, too, who worked to\nimprove postgraduate grants in London.\nWhen thinking then, in the next few weeks, of our choice for the\nPresident of I.C.U., we must bear in mind that the incumbent has these\ntwo roles to fill. It is not just sufficient that he is efficient in administration, or that he be a\" good lad.\" He must have some purpose,\nsome ambition for I.C., and a social conscience to make him aware\nwhere faults or injustices occur.\nHe needs the determination, too, to continue to vaunt and make\nknown our opinion when necessary.\nFELIX\nFinally we take an introvert look at FELIX. We have pleasure\nin informing our readers that FELIX will be growing bigger next\nyear, with a new page size double the size of the present one. This\nwill allow greater scope in the presentation of a page and lead to a more stimulating layout.\nThis year we are able to say that FELIX has made a slight\nprofit. We are one of the few student newspapers to make a profit*,\nbut why, though, should a student paper have to make a profit?\nFELIX acts as the shop window to the Union and as such performs a very great service for the Union. We therefore feel that the idea of\nsub sidi sing FELIX when it makes a loss should be replaced by a direct\nand large grant. Only in this way can we afford to become the\n\" professionally\" produced paper our Union deserves.\nFELIX London, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTelephones : KEN2963 EDITOR : D.E. POTTER\nAsst.

On my table at the second\nsitting (for which I had to wait a half-hour) the chicken was missing\nfrom most plates and one had no\nchicken and very little salad. Mooney\nis quite able to produce a reasonable\nmeal as is evident from this year's Engineers' Dinner and Dance.\nThe organization in the main dancing hall was atrocious! The folk\nsinger\u2014a) Mr. Diz Disley\u2014was, at\nthe best, mediocre; and at his worst\n\u2014bad, very bad. About half the\naudience walked out during his\nmournful hour. Later we had Mr.\nJesse Fuller with his one-man band.\nHe started 15 minutes late\u2014due perhaps to no fault of his own\u2014and gave\nan uninspired performance of numerous blues numbers. We were then delighted by a15 minutes pause during\nwhich nothing happened. WViat followed is too pathetic for words\u2014my\nmain regret is that such an attractive\nyoung lady should have been caught\nup in the mess.\nIn my view and, I believe, that of\nsome others, the May Ball was rather\na mess. 1 would say a few good\nthings, however\u2014the decor was simple\nbut good, and several of the bands\nand groups were quite good.\n1 should like to ask the entertainments Committee several questions:\u2014\n(1) Why more careful planning was\nnot done to remove these annoying\ntime-wasting periods?\n(2) How the Committee has the\nright to reserve part of the very\nlimited main hall space for its own\nprivate use and private party?\n(3) Who should have been in command during the evening?\n(4) Who was the mysterious gentleman (not in evening dress) who\ncrowned the Carnival Queen and what\nrelevance is he to the major part of\nthe members of the Union?\n(5) How did numerous \" gentlemen \" not in evening dress manage\nto get into the Ball?\nMy suggestions for future May\nBalls include :\n(1) Better planning and someone\nwho is responsible for the general\nrunning all evening.\n(2) More quality and less quantity\nin the number of bands, groups and\nentertainers.\n(3) Bars which have a complete\nrange of drinks right up until closing\ntime.\n(4) Tickets which arrive well before the event, not two days before.\n(5) Organisers to remove glasses\nand chairs from the dance floor and\nto do more general tidying work\nduring the evening\u2014such as collecting\nempty glasses more quickly.\nC.A. STEWART (Civil Eng 3)\nSir,\n1 have, in the past, defended\nFELIX in its attacks on inefficiency\nand mismanagement in the Union.\nHowever, your last issue carried an\nunwarranted attack on Stew Chapman, and, indirectly, on IC Ents. in\ngeneral.\nA mistake was obviously made but\nwhether through any inefficiency I doubt very much. 1 know, through\nmy work on RCS Ents., what a big\nevent like the May Ball means in\nterms of strain and pressure. Unforeseen events occur, in this case theft,\nthat cannot be accounted for in ad-vance. I can assure you, and the\nUnion, that this is not the first event\nthis year to be marred by theft, in\none case almost certainly by Union\nmembers.\nBut this whole incident only focuses\nmore clearly just what Ents. members\nhave to put up with. As Colcutt said\nin the same issue, those who are\nactive in the Union suffer tremendous pressure. This is not only academically for it can lead to severe\nemotional strain. I feel very bitter,\nand so do many others, to hear nothing but complaints when we have\nspent months arranging an event.\nThere is never a word of appreciation.\nThis year I produced the Smoking\nConcert and RCS Carnival Cabaret.\nThere were complaints about both\nfrom the Union. The latter involved\nmany weeks of preparation ending\nwith a23 hour period of continuous\norganisation and work. On the night,\nfaced with a drunken, hostile audi-en ce, the sound failed, through no-one's fault, an artiste failed to fulfil\nher contract, and an important cast\nmember was unfortunately ill (who\ncould foresee that?) The cabaret\nstarted late, as we had quickly improvised and rearranged, but we were\ndrowned with abuse from the mob\nbelow. What can we do?\nI for one, am not prepared to continue working day and night to produce entertainment for selfish, ungrateful members of IC. Unless there\nis a radical change shortly I, and I won't be alone, will refuse to work\nunder these conditions.\nM. DUCKETT\nChairman-elect of R.C.S. Ents.\nM. TAIT\nSecretary-elect of R.C.S. Ents.\nPARKING MEETERS\nSir,\nSinqe your last issue both the\nCollege and the College Brancn\nof the A. Sc.W have objected\nto the City of Westminster's proposed parking scheme for the area\naround Imperial College. In this connection we find that the only long\nterm solution seems to be the following scheme ;\n(1) Make the complex comprising\nImperial College and the Museums\ninto a pedestrians only area.\n(2) Route through traffic round this\narea, or in the case cf traffic\nfrom Hyde Park, under it by a tunnel\nterminating at Cromwell Road.\n(3) Establish parking for College\nStaff and Students and residents by\nunderground parking in Hyde Park\nwith access by pedestrian tunnels to\nthe pedestrian area.\nThis would be a multi-million\nscheme with many technical diff i cul ties. However, the end product would\nbe a South Kensington that was a show-piece for the whole country, as\nwell as the solution of the traffic and\nparking problem for I.C.H. FAIRBROTHER\nSecretary, A. Sc.W NOISE IN HALL\nSir.\nIn Selkirk Hall, staircase seven\nabove flight four there is an imbecilic\nsot, and I care not a damn at calling\nhim such. Perhaps he will realise\nwhat I mean when I say that at 1.30\na.m. on Monday morning. May 8th he\ncrawled up the stairs shouting and\nscreaming like a newly born pi|j. This sort of thing is not funny\nespecially when one* has been awakened the night before at 1.00 a.m. by an equally imbecilic sot setting\nthe fire alarms off.\nI expect that the attitude of most\npeople is that this is the sort of things\nthat one must put up with when\n\" fortunate e nou gn to he in Han.\nI think it's about time that certain\npeople who sit and think up rules for\nHalls of Residence decided to sit and\nthink of some way of imposing them.\nThe idea of having wardens and Hall\nCommittees is ludicrous when they\ncannot control what's going on right\nunder their noses.\nYours faithfully.\nN.W.

Last year a profit of\nunder \u00a31,000 was realised.\nThe beginning of the academic year saw no Carnival Organiser\nand no Carnival Committee\u2014the previously elected Carnival Organiser\nhad failed to return to I.C. Jerry Stockbridge was appointed coordinator and Dick Conn, Vice-President of R. C.S.U., was particularly\ninterested. It was he who stimulated the collecting by arousing\nR. C.S.U. With RCS stepping ahead in collections RSM and C&G set out to beat them.\nMolam and O 'Reilly of Mines were\nparticularly keen and energetic and\nMines achieved by far the greatest\nproportion of money per head, with\na total of \u00a3426.\nBut the novelty of the year and\nthe factor which made this years'\nCarnival such a success was the folk\nconcert. With the Albert Hall almost\nRCS Elections\nHulme keeps\nFuchs out\nIn a low poll which had to be\nratified at the RCS A.G.M., George Hulme was elected President ot RCSU. Well-known\n\" politician \" Frank Fuchs was\nthe only other candidate.\nAt the actual elections, held prior\nto the A.G.M., Hulme received 203\nvotes compared to the 173 votes cast\nfor Fuchs, there being 53 spoilt papers\nand abstentions recorded. However\nthe poll was below the one third demanded by the constitution and hence\nthe need for ratification \u2014 duly\nachieved by a vote of 110 to 102.\nVice-President since January this\nyear, following the resignation of\nDick Conn. Hulme is now faced with\nthe problem of returning as a PG\nwith a pass degree ! It is therefore\nvery unlikely that Hulme will return\nnext year. He in fact stood for\nRCSU President to oppose Fuchs and\npersonally to keep Fuchs out.\nfull, and the artistes a great success\nwith the largely external audience, a profit of \u00a31,000 was achieved on the\nconcert alone. Jerry Stockbridge\nwarns, however, that the essential\nsuccess of the Folk Concert was its\nnovelty. In future years, while the\nHall should be used again, different\nforms of entertainment should be\nprovided. He suggests as examples\ngypsy dancing or a pop concert.\nAnother novelty this years were the\npools, run by Frank Morris, which\nnetted \u00a355. The raffle was once again\nsuccessful, bringing in \u00a3450, and the\nCarnival week's events, including the\nDramsoc Revue, the International\nEvening and the Fete, produced \u00a3122.\nMALL MODEL\nDonations are still coming in and\nhave reached \u00a345. Prominent among\nthe donors was Tony Duke, who gave\n\u00a315. earned as a male model.\nJerry Stockbridge is well pleased\nwith the result of Carnival but claims\nthat still greater financial success\ncould be achieved.\n\" The inter-College rivalry must be\nmaintained as an incentive. Each\nyear we must aim to beat the previous\nyear's record. Carnival must aim at\ncollecting money from outside I.C.

This was made\nclear in a statement by the Union\nof Liberal Students.\nUnder a loans system students\nwould have to repay the money\nspent on their university education\non a kind of hire-purchase basis.\nU.L.

Together with the Radical\nStudents Alliance they intend to hold\na series of rallies across the country\nand convene a number of protest\nmeetings with local councillors and\nMPs.\nTheir statement ends, \" The struggle\nagainst loans is the fight for free\neducation, not just the free education which we enjoy now but t ne free education that should be the right\nof generations to come.\" One hopes\nthat NUS will follow the Liberal Student's' lead.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022sla al nil n \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 a IN THIS ISSUE\nCOLCUTT PAGE 3\n\" The Role of the President,\" discussed by Tony Duke and Frank\nFuchs PAGE 5\nReview of the Year\nby Colin Harrison . .

    "content": "FELIX 3\nThe most haunted\nhouse in England ?\nCOL CUT T\" All (he stuff of sheer Vicforian melodrama is there, and\nnot a man, woman or dog for\nmiles around doubt these things.\"\nSo concluded a recent newspaper\narticle.\n\" We witnessed ostensibly\nparanormal phenomena\u2014 never\nbefore have I experienced anything like this,\" testified a mem-of the Society for Psychic Research.\n\" . . . A maidservant rushed\nout of the house screaming one\nnight at midnight and was never\nseen again. . . . The body of a dead woman was dragged by unseen hands across an oaken floor\n. . . creaking stairs . . . bumps\nand groans,\" reported an incredulous journalist. \" Is it the most\nhaunted house in England ?\" he\nasked.\nUnfortunately the H.G. Wells Society \"Ghost Group\" that set out\nover Easter failed to obtain positive\nproof to back up these flor rid but unsubstantiated comments about\nthe happenings. Eleven members of\nthe group spent two nights in the Hall\nsurrounded by a vast array of electronic equipment.\nHannath Hall is a brick farmhouse\nin the heart of the Fens near the village of Tydd St. Mary. It is reputed\nto be 400 years old but its association with the supernatural only began\nin 1870 when it was owned by a rich\nlandowner named Joseph Hannath.\nHe was very devoted to his wife and\nwhen she died after forty years of\nmarriage he was so grief-stricken that\nhe refused to bury her. Only after\nsix weeks was the old man persuaded\nto grant the mould e ring corpse the\nsanctuary of the earth. It is said\nthat no one has slept peacefully in\nthat bedroom since then. ~This\nnaturally became the target for the\nWells Soc. investigation.\nElectronics\nThe plans for the expedition were\nbased on two assumptions :\u2014\n(1) The area was infested with practical jr k: rs and hoaxers.\n(2) Members of the expedition\nwould endeavour to wreck havoc by slipping off and creating\nartificial phenomena.\nWorking on these premises, an\nelaborate combination of human and\nelectronic vigil was devised so that at\nno time in the night could anyone\nenter the building without the team's knowledge and that no member of the\nteam was ever left alone\u2014a condition\nto which the team readily agreed.\nWithin three hours of their arrival\nat the house the team was ready for\naction. Seven hyper-sensitive microphones connected to four tape recorders were placed at strategic points\naround the house, and infra red\nphotography gave the audio and visual\nrecords of events. Other equipment\nused included trip wires to warn of\nany entry into the building and a complicated series of coloured light\nsignals devised to convey instructions\nto other members of the team.\nThe first night saw no untoward\nhappenings. A persistent clanking\nwhich caused initial alarm was finally\nattributed to a loose pane in a greenhouse window 50 yards away -this\nwas removed and the vigil continued.\nHowever no further incidents were ,\nreported.\nThe second day was devoted to discussions of the activities of the night\nbefore and preparations for the\nsecond and last night. Nick Clarke\nmeanwhile, besides taking numerous\nphotographs, had been measuring the\nsize ol bricks in the loft. This gave\nrise to grave doubts about the antiquity of the house.\nClatter !\nThe final night was more eventful.\nBy 8.30 all but three of the team had\ndisappeared to the local for fortification against the elements ahead during\nthe long night. The three remaining in\nthe house, Moont, Haslinger and\nSpence fell asleep in the warm control\nroom. But at 9.25 their sleep was interrupted abruptly by an almighty\nc la 'ter over the loudspeaker. Nothing\nmore happened but later it was noticed that the clock in the room\u2014\nthat had been deliberately stopped\nbeforehand at 4.20\u2014had been reset to\ndead on 12 o 'clock.\nThus the team returned home empty-handed with no recording of \" in tell i gence-applied tapping.\" No polythene bags full of \" Genuine Ye Olde\nEngland\" ectoplasm, selling for 5s. each, would dominate the Carnival\nFete !\nHowever these negative results do\nnot provide sufficient ground to conclude that the supernatural is pure\nfiction. This would be the same as\nassuming that the population of\nEngland was all-male on the basis of\nof a census conducted in the Union\nBar\nEndless\nvoid . . . .\nOne investigator of psychic phenomena puts it :\n\"Certain things happen which cannot be explained. But they happen,\nso how can they be explained?\" We\nin the \"Ghosts Group\" are trying to\nanswer that question and will continue to do so until we strike lucky.\nBut. come to think of it. the\nchimneys were twisted and the moon\ndid project weird forms on the\ndarkened landscape and . yes\nthe trees did stretch their tortured\nskeletal fingers into the black, endless\nvoid . and the temperature certainly\nwas that of the tomb. In fact, it is\nquite obvious that the poltergeist\nsimply had an innate fear of things\nelectronic.\nWARREN MITCHELL\nFolk Conce\nThe risk that this year's Carnival Committee took, in organising an event costing nearly as\nmuch as last year's entire Carnival proceeds (give or take, a thousand pounds) paid off hand-some ly, although not as handsomely as had been hoped.\nThe Folk Concert went off without\na hitch. Despite the uninviting pit\nof empty, expensive seats separating\nthe 7/6's and the 10/ 's from the performing artistes, the audience reacted\nwell, ali hough it was slow to join vi\non sing-song choruses. Reducing the\nprice of the expensive seats might\ncure this problem another year, without reducing income.\nMuch of the success of the evening\nwas attributable to Warren Mitchell,\nwho had the actor's sense of exactly\nwhen to hold the stage. No matter\nwhether he was being superbly comic\n(His Hungarian Folk* Song went.\n\" lts along var to tip par are\"). or making a very sincere request for r honey. which should be tape-recorded and\nused as an example, he held attention\nthe whole time, and formed the link\na show of this kind needs.\nThe first item was a performance\nby Bob Davenport and the Rakes\nwho played some very lively folk-songs, including some excellent fid d ling, and these were followed by\nAnne Briggs and John Steele. Completely d it le rent in style, these two\ncomplemented each other \u2014 Anne\nBriggs with her wailing, expressionless style, and John Steele with his\nlightheaded humorous style of sing-ing. The Young Tradition and the\nWatersons were hardly worth a men-tion, but Steve Grant, who opened the\nsecond half, was excellent, and free.\nHe was received with such acclaim by\npartisan and non-partisan alike that\nhe had to return and sing an encore\nof \" There once was a garden.\"\nFinally, the Dubliners. who lived\nup to their name as comics, singers\nand above all. musicians. All their\nnumbers were entertaining, although\nthe last two Drunken Nights remained\ndisappointingly unsung. Perhaps their\nbest pieces were those two played on\nguitar and mandolin es. The concert made a profit of \u00a31,000\nfor Carnival Charity.\nElections come and elections go but\nspeculation goes on tor ever In a recent S.A.M. poll a representative\nsample of the refectory queue gave\nthe following answers to the question:\n\" How interested are you in the Composition of the Executive Committee\nfor next year?\"\nInterested 15%\nDisinterested 15%\nWhich Executive\nCommittee? 20%\nWhat is the Executive\nCommittee? 50%\nThus, allowing for the \" don't knows\" etc.. and showing that you\ncan prove anything by statistics, 50\nper cent of students are interested\nin Union politics. I suppose therefore\nsome space should be devoted to a few of the candidates for these top\nposts. At the time of writing both\nMines and RCS have held their elections and neither has elected a politician as President. George Hulmc\ndefeated renowned bureaucrat Frank\nFuchs in a contest at which less than\none third of RCS bothered to vote.\nFortunately the RCS A.G.M.( also\nless than one third of RCS present l was able to ratify the result before\nthe v were available.\nPRESIDENT\nThis year so far we ve had no motions from the Union floor about the\nPresidency and so it looks as though\nonce more he will be elected by joint\ncouncil. The two most likely candidates are this year's Chairman of\n'Debates. Chris Eriksson, and A.C.C. Chairman Ray Phillips. Mr. Eriksson\nis very efficient, backed by this year's executive and therefore favourite, but\nat the same time he is a bureaucrat\nand tends to be rather humour less. Ray Phillips is a bubbling extrovert,\nwith a mastery of repartee, and will\nhave to prove that he can act like a responsible adult. It must be said\nin his favour that he has a knack\nof controlling committee meetings and\nhas run A.C.C. very well this yea i. More interesting than the candidates\nare their stable companions. Chris\nEriksson would almost certainly favour Mike Edwards as secretary.\nWhen one considers that Council will\nalready have arch bureaucrat Peter\nRuhemann on it. it seems likely that\nextremely long and entangled meetings will ensue. On the other hand\nMr Edwards is also of the efficient\nand humour les variety and will nicely\nbalance the more hearty elements of\nthe Exec. It is hard to say who will\nget Mr Phillips backing but I think\nthat Rex Lowin. who is both amiable\nand efficient, as shown by his part in\nstudent housing, is the most likely\nperson. All in all. both pairs have\ntheir good and bad points. If the\nUnion is to get any work done.\nMessrs. Eriksson and Edwards will\nhave to swallow their books of standing orders and get used to having\ntheir legs pulled. Or if the Union is\nto be respected by the College the\nother pair will have to show everybody just how sensible they can be\nwhen necessary.\nFuchs?\nThe last important post is that of\nDeputy President which looks like\nbeing contended for by Messrs. Lack\nand Redmayne. Fortunately either\nof these could do the job. In view of\nhis work this year as Publicity\nOfficer. I think Martin Lack is more\nlikely to be elected.\nBy the way, I don't think we've seen\nthe last of Mr. Fuchs: he could still\nstand for floor-representative and even\nPresident. He may be a bureaucrat\nbut he is one of the most enthusiastic\npeople in the Union. He is always\nwilling to listen to and consider other\npeople's points of view and although\nthe \" hearties\" don't like him his\npresence on Council is often an asset.\n\n"

Students haven't got much\nmoney and won't part with it anyway,\n'this leads to the conclusion that\nMOST of the money must come from\n\"tin-shaking\" in the first term of\nthe year. This must build up over the\nyears to produce immense amounts of\nmoney in the future. I can see no\nreason why next year's Carnival\nshould not raise \u00a310,000, as the available sources have barely been tapped.\nThe extension of the participation\nof year reps, and Vice-Presidenis is\na must for the continued success of\nCarnival in future. Less effort must\nbe expended on time-wasting, low-profit ventures such as the film-shows.\nAs for more concrete suggestions, I would suggest dropping the Summer\nCarnival week and having a Rave\nInternational evening and Revue in\nthe second term of the year, when\npeople have not yet succumbed to the\nhorrendous spectre of the examiner\nleering over the general mist of problem sheets and course work.\nActing on the experience gained at\nthe Albert Hall this year, Carnival\nshould hold at least one Giant Concert each year and a collecting rag\nweek at the end of the Christmas\nterm.\nThis year's football pool showed a. profit of over \u00a350 and this has been\na very good effort for the first year\nit has been attempted.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nTHE YEAR THAT WAS\nFollowing the disorganised, ill-Supported Carnival last year with its\ndismaying yield of \u00a3800, this year has\nhad a new commercial money-making\noutlook. Instead of a doubtful ten\ndays' activity in the summer term in\nwhich to collect the public's money, it\nhas changed to a year-round organisation with which many members have\nidentified themselves, jerry's energy\nand his imaginative team have produced what is rumoured to be a date by the \" sportsman.\" At the\nbeginning of this academic year Tony\ncalled for a strong Union but for a long time he took a lenient hold on\nits activities\u2014leniency which he tried\nto end at the chaotic Union meeting\nlast term. Certainly he has consistently failed to take a firm stand\nagainst the excesses of his \" sporting \" colleagues, it would be easy\nto go on and catalogue the failings of\nthis powerful character- a position\nPHOENIX failed to get up to date\nrecord year\u2014the courage to risk a large amount in booking the Albert\nHall paid, and will, I hope, become a regular feature of the Union's act iv i ties. As the year progressed, the Carnival organisation became larger and\nmore diffuse with Jerry becoming less\naware of the fringe activities. This\nis perhaps an excuse for the puerile\npublication, Bog, and those pointless\nand destructive evenings of fly-post-ing.\nPoliticians\n& Sportsman\nElsewhere in this issue, I am told,\nMessrs. Duke and Fuchs are giving\ntheir views on the Presidency. These\ntwo represent the two major pressure\ngroups in IC : the \" Sportsmen \" and\nthe \" politicians.\" I am puzzled to\nknow whether the existence of these\nactive groups (for no one could accuse them of apathy) has a good or\nbad effect on the Union. Their\nactivity in the past has let to covert\nconflicts, e.g., to prevent the unpopular \" politician \" Keith Guy from being elected President. Tony Duke\nwas apparently put up as a can di like the Presidency is too exposed and\nhides no weaknesses. One- of the\nmain obstructions in the way of an\neffective criticism of him is, as any of\nhis acquaintances knows, that he is\n\" such a good blok e \"\u2014an elitist\nwhose friendliness could have been\nbetter applied to strong management\nof the Union.\nWith the exception of the new projects listed above, I would describe\nthis as a year in which the Union\nhas been \" allowed to run itself.\"\nThere has been too little direction ;\ntoo often the attitude of people in\npositions of responsibility has been\nthat problems are never too pressing\nand can always be postponed until\nnext year. The would-be managers\nof next year's Union should realise\nthat theirs should be a heavy responsibility, particularly at the very top.\nIt is not enough to take a year of\npower and leave the Union running\neven more erratically to a halt.\nCOLIN HARRISON.\nIC up the Orinoco\nThis summer I.C. will be sending out three expeditions\u2014to East\nGreenland. Ethiopia and the River Orinoco. The College is one of\nthe very few who send, let alone finance, expeditions. The first one\nwas in 1957, and the target was Everest. For this trip, a grant of\n\u00a35,000 was raised by the College and Union. In the following ten\nyears, 34 expeditions were organised., in which 218 men and 12\nwomen have taken part.\nOf the first Exploration Board\nGrant of \u00a35.000 much was spent on\nequipment, which was used by subsequent expeditions. The average grant\nis now \u00a31.300\u2014-of which \u00a31.000 comes\nfrom the College Governors, and \u00a3300\nfrom the Union. The personal contribution, expected from each member\nat the party, now stands at \u00a360.\nThere are now three or four expeditions a year, costing about \u00a3L200\neach. This is derived, in equal pro-portions, from three sources \u2014 the\nBoard, the Explorers and External\nfirms and foundations.\nEach year 1 C. provides near to 10\nper cent of the University expenditure from this country.
