Another exceptional starter,\nthe marinated herring - soft and tender cured fish\ndrizzled with linseed oil simply melts on your\ntongue. Another classic is the dish of dumplings\nwith the golden ratio of soft white cheese and\npotatoes sprinkled with chopped parsley and\nbacon, which has scored a respectable 9 out of\n10 in dumpling wars. The two-course Espresso\nlunch offer for \u00a39 (\u00a37 with iConnect!) has a generous portion of soup and classic Polish chicken.\nWell roasted, with a strong home-oven scent and\nstuffing, the quartered chicken served with carrots and mashed potatoes beats Nando\u2019s hands\ndown in both quality and price.

However, Iran has dismissed\nIsraeli claims saying that it was a planned year long\ntraining mission on intelligence gathering to prepare\ncadets to defend Iranian ships from Somali pirates.\nThe two ships are armed with missiles and torpedoes and have been allowed to transit the canal as\nthey do not contain nuclear or chemical weapons.\nAlthough, the Suez Canal is an internal body of wa-ter, Egypt is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords\nand the 1888 Constantinople Convention to guarantee the freedom of passage of ships belonging to\nall nations.\nIran\nA magnitude 6.3\nearthquake has struck\nthe city of Christchurch in New Zealand\u2019s\nSouth Island killing at\nleast 75 people. The\nearthquake is New\nZealand\u2019s deadliest\nnatural disaster in 80\nyears and struck during Christchurch\u2019s busy lunchtime hour. Sections of\nthe city, including the city\u2019s landmark Christchurch\nCathedral have been damaged. Christchurch is built\non silt, sand and gravel with a water table lying directly underneath the city. This makes the city particularly vulnerable to the process of liquefaction of\nthe soil during an earthquake.\nIndia\nA special court in India has found 31 people guilty\nof setting fire to a passenger train in the town of\nGodhra in 2002. The burning of the Samarbadi Express killed 59 Hindu pilgrims and sparked a religious riot in India which left over 2000 dead. Tuesday\u2019s verdict supports claims that the attack was\na planned attack. An earlier national inquiry on the\nincident, drew the conclusion that the fire was an\naccident, although other official investigations differed in their findings. The special court also acquitted 63 people of conspiracy and murder and is\nexpected to read out the sentences of those found\nguilty on Friday.\nWe finished dinner around ten o\u2019clock and the\nshooting started perhaps ten minutes later. It\nmay be a clich\u00e9 but the air really did feel electrified as I hugged the ground to myself in the\npitch black night. Bullets were soon coming\nacross us from both sides of our camp but two\nminutes later, twelve minutes after dinner was\nfinished, the shooting stopped. Battles are inevitably short when a bullet cost as much as a\nday\u2019s food.\nWe were in a village turned refugee camp in\nNorthern Kenya where perhaps 500 of the Turkana people were taking shelter from a tribal\ndispute with neighbouring Ethiopians. The\nEthiopian tribe was known to attack even this\nconcentrated group of Turkana \u2013 two members\nof my adult literacy class had been shot dead\nwhile fishing nearby just two months earlier.\nBut it soon transpired that this attack, breaking weeks of unprecedented ceasefire, was evidence that the Turkana had a new enemy to contend with- their own police. Drunk and heavily\narmed, a group of Kenyan police (dispatched to\nthe area to cool tribal tensions) entered the refugee camp to take a group of women away on\ninvented claims of petty theft. When the men\nof the village, some of them husbands to these\nwomen, refused them permission the police\neventually drove away, firing drunkenly at the\ncamp as they left. When the refugees returned\nfire, police camped beside us started to shoot\nacross our camp and into the village. Kenyans\nwere firing on Kenyans.\nOnly alcohol and low visibility prevented\nanyone from dying that night and by morning,\nthough feeling uneasy, most of the Turkana\nhad shaken off the events of the night before.\nMen were tending to their goats, women salted\nfish for market and the children (those not out\nworking) went to school. But this return to normality wasn\u2019t because no one cared. The only\nway that a whole village of people can accept\nthe threat of rape and the knowledge that loved\nones were inches from death is if they have no\nhope. Nothing will change, so just get on with\nthings. Injustice was robbing them of the little\nthey had.\nThe Turkana aren\u2019t the only Kenyans to suffer at the hands of their own law enforcers;\nreports of extra judicial killings by the police\nare all too common. In 2008, a report by Kenya\u2019s own National Commission on Human\nRights found that an estimated 500 young\nmen were killed or disappeared in a single\ncampaign by the police against the criminal\nMugiki group. According to the report, the\nkillings took place with the apparent support\nof political leaders, including the internal security minister. Since its publication, one of\nthe report\u2019s key witnesses has been killed and\nseveral of the authors have had to flee abroad.\nYet its findings were dismissed by police\ncommissioner Major-General Hussein Ali as\nbeing \u201crather infantile\u201d.\nWorryingly, killings such as these often enjoy public approval; they are seen as preferable\nto a slow and often corrupt legal system. Just\nlast month, photographs emerged in The Daily\nNation newspaper showing a plain clothed police officer execute three unarmed men at point\nblank by the side of a busy road. The papers\nand radio stations were full the next day with\nordinary Kenyans backing the use of lethal\nforce by the police as an acceptable alternative\nto due legal process.\nBut the tide of public opinion is starting\nto turn. Revelations that at least 400 of the\n1,500 who died during 2008\u2019s post election\nviolence were killed by Kenyan police have\nmade clearer to the public that not all victims of this \u2018rough justice\u2019 need be hardened\ncriminals. The burst of civic education in the\nbuild up to the ratification of the country\u2019s\nnew constitution last August has educated a\nnew generation of Kenyans about the importance of rights and accountability. The immense popularity of the mobile phone means\nthat more and more Kenyans can make anonymous complaints about the police. These\ndevelopments can only be a good thing and\nmust be encouraged.\nBut it remains to be seen how long it will\ntake for change to trickle through to the Turkana people. Mobile phone masts don\u2019t reach\nthat far into the country side and very few\nadults have the minimum education necessary\nto file a complaint. The Kenyan police alone\nwrote the report on that night\u2019s shooting \u2013 it\nwas all started, of course, by the refugees.\nChanges in the public\u2019s attitude towards police impunity as well as tools to fight it are\nto be welcomed and can receive support from\nthe international community but it is hard to\nsee change on the horizon for the people of\nTurkana. Ill fortune may have robbed them of\nthe health, education and prosperity given to\nso many others but to see them robbed too of\nhope is heartbreaking.\nA plain clothed Kenyan policeman photographed shooting suspects on a busy road\n\u201cBullets\nwere\ncoming\nacross us\nfrom both\nsides\u201d\nRory Fenton\n\u201cWorryingly, killings such\nas these often enjoy\npublic approval\u201d\nThe Turkana people of northern Kenya\nFriday 25 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nBeat the Bush\nAdministration\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector Doug Liman\nScreenwriter Jez Butterworth, JohnHenry Butterworth\nCast Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, Sonya\nDavison\nFair Game\nJohn Park\nNaomi just realised she left the back door unlocked\nFELIX\n20\nimaginative ways, and the couple is branded as\nbeing traitors of America. \u201cNot supporting the\ntroops,\u201d a popular saying used by right-wing\nBush supporters to criticise anyone who has\nanything to say against the war, is also in full\nuse here.\nIt may come across as a touch too self-involved, showing the trials of how one family struggles back in their comfortable house,\nwhilst so many soldiers are dying. Plame\u2019s\nconfidential informants are in danger as they\nare left out in the open. We hear the news of\nhow a lot of them have been assassinated as a\nconsequence of her being outed: but none of\nthis is shown to any memorable level, and is\nscarcely mentioned in passing.\nThis story was covered extensively in the international media and for that, the film loses\nthe element of surprise, but under the steady\nhands of Doug Liman, the director of The\nBourne Identity, he makes sure there are characters for us to relate to. Plame may be an agent\nwho travels around the globe, but to balance\neverything out, she has a loving family and\na domestic life for her to get back to. Watts\nshows these two contrasting sides well.\nFair Game has that odd but watchable mix of\nan inspiring biopic and politics. A lot of careful\nexplanation is given as to bring everyone up to\ndate with the Valerie Plame case and the film\nis more than successful at stirring up a strong,\nlasting feeling of discomfort and rage towards\nthe government, people of high authority, and\nabuse of power. It\u2019s clear where the lead characters stand \u2013 they\u2019re not unpatriotic. She was\na spy, and he used to be an ambassador. They\nwere trying their best to serve their country until an unfortunate screw-up somewhere in between all the hushed conversations ruined eve-Here is what happened: the United States government decided to invade Iraq for possessing\ndangerous weapons supplied by the African\nnation of Niger. An American international\nconsultant was asked to gather sufficient evidence from Africa to prove that Iraq was in\nfact buying these weapons. He found none, and\nwrote a report that said exactly that. So when\nhe realised that his very clear report was completely ignored and The White House went to\nwar anyway, he wrote another article, this time\nto The New York Times, about the invalidity of\nthe American invasion. Ill-advised of course,\nbut his conscience didn\u2019t allow him to just look\nthe other way.\nIs this a win for him, and the constitution of\nfree speech? Hardly, since on the next day, his\nwife is outed as a CIA spy in a national newspaper \u2013 as retribution for speaking out against\nThe White House. This scandal, which caused\nquite a stir, is the \u201cValerie Plame affair\u201d in\nwhich Ms. Plame (Naomi Watts), an active\ncovert CIA agent mainly working in the Middle East with crucial informants, was publicly\nidentified, as a result of her husband Joe Wilson\u2019s (Sean Penn) controversial editorial piece,\ntitled \u201cWhat I Didn\u2019t Find in Africa.\u201d Soon\nafter the publication of Plame\u2019s real identity,\ntheir world comes crashing down. Several media outlets start spinning this story in the most\nClassic Cinema\nCasablanca\nCasablanca, a black and white timeless masterpiece,\nwas released in 1943. The script for the unstaged\nplay on which the film is based fatefully found its way\nto the desk of a Warner Brothers employee the day\nafter Pearl Harbour, and was rapidly adapted into an\niconic wartime romance set in the North African city\nof Casablanca.\nCasablanca during the Second World War was a\nreal melting pot for Europe. It was a holding point for\nrefugees from the Nazi regime and this is the premise for the film. A phenomenal mix of different characters supports the signature performance of Humphrey Bogart as Rick, an American who runs a \u201cgin\njoint\u201d where most of the action takes place. Rick\u2019s\nresolution to never get involved with his customers is\nbroken when Ilsa Lund, played by the stunning Ingrid\nBergman, walks back into his life.\nDespite its rapid conversion into a screenplay, the\nscript is outstanding. The small, understated quips\nand witty dialogue are what really make this film\nmemorable. This is the source of one of the great\nmisquotes of cinema: Bogart never actually says\n\u201cplay it again, Sam\u201d. The Sam in question is Bogart\u2019s\npianist and friend, who came with him from Paris and\nis the first to recognise Ilsa when she enters Rick\u2019s\nwith a famous resistance leader played by Paul Henreid. Sam and his band provide a very well crafted\nmusical backdrop to the night club scenes as well\nas the unforgettable \u201cAs Time Goes By\u201d. This song,\ncoupled with the more overtly dramatic score and\nthe passionate rendition of the Marseilles, make this\nfilm as acoustically impressive as it is visually.\nMost of the film takes place in Rick\u2019s, which creates\na very intense atmosphere at times \u2013 many of the\nscenes are almost like watching a play rather than\na film. Made in a short time on a shoestring budget,\nthis film is a welcome break from computerised overblown special effects and shaky camerawork and is\na great example of how a great atmosphere can be\ncreated just from a few locations.\nThis is a film which really deserves its reputation\nas one of the best films ever made, and don\u2019t let that\nreputation put you off: it\u2019s charming, thrilling and very\nfun to watch.\nGuy Needham\nDon\u2019t worry darling, Kadhim can\u2019t hurt you now\nFair Game has that odd\nbut watchable mix of\nan inspiring biopic and\npolitics\n\u201c\ne in-in-oses\noses\neady\neady\nThe\nThe\nchar-har-Fair Game\nFair Gam\nbut watch\nbut watch\n\u201d\nmix of\nmix\nopic and\nopic and\nFriday 25 february 2011\nrything. They are the victims here, and Liman\nlets us know it. Dealing with a subject that is\nstill painfully relevant today, it\u2019s an admirable\neffort to get the story out there.\nWatts and Penn, paired up here for the third\ntime, showcase strong performances once\nmore. Penn has less to do, and his character is\nless well drawn than Watts. He is the angry, betrayed citizen who is being hounded by those\naround him for doing the right thing. Undoubtedly though, the star here is Watts whose subtle\nperformance, grasping the frustration and fear\nthat surround the challenges she needs to face,\nis more than enough to carry the film all on her\nown.\nIt\u2019s not a 100% unbiased effort. Some of\nthe villains are almost written to the level of\ncaricature, and if you want a broader scope\non the Plame scandal you would be better off\nreading about the whole thing on Wikipedia.\nBut what articles won\u2019t tell you is how the\nincident affected Plame on a personal level.\nDon\u2019t be mistaken into thinking this is a political spy-thriller \u2013 the trailer wrongly oversells\non this point. But it\u2019s a promising, touching\nfamily drama with some good old-fashioned\nBush-Administration-bashing.\n\n"

Yes, they have broken a manifesto commitment against raising tuition\nfees, yes, they have gone into coalition\nwith the hated Tories but really, was\nthere an alternative?\nThe election delivered a hung par-liament, and with a hurricane of debt\nthreatening to engulf Greece, the scar-ily large deficit seemed to put Britain\nat risk of having a debt crisis as well.\nSure, in hindsight, we weren\u2019t likely to\nget caught up by the same tidal wave as\nGreece but we had no way to be sure\nat the time.

The increases are a bitter pill to\nswallow, and I certainly don\u2019t agree with\nsuch drastic rises, but it is just one policy (albeit a major one), and given Osborne\u2019s determination to hack away at\nuniversity budgets with a battleaxe, it\u2019s\na necessary one.

This came despite overwhelming support for the resolution from most\nof the international community, including the other fourteen Security Council\nmembers \u2013 even the United Kingdom,\nFrance and Germany did not abstain.\nRather, the representative of Israel\u2019s European allies, British ambassador Mark\nLyall Grant, described the settlements as\n\u201cillegal under International law.\u201d\nConsidering the history of the USA\nand Israel in the UN, this seems like\nbusiness as usual. After all, the USA\nhas vetoed 10 different resolutions condemning Israel since 2000.

Unsurprisingly, the USA is seen as the only ally\nfor a country surrounded by states that\nat best mistrust it and, at worst, want it\nwiped off the map. However, given the\nObama administration\u2019s general policy\nregarding Israel as well as its fear over\nprotests rocking the rest of the region, it\nis a strange political move.\nAfter all, since coming to power,\nthe Obama administration has taken a\nmarkedly less supportive view of Israeli policy than under George W. Bush.\nObama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have openly disagreed\nover Israel\u2019s right to continue building\nin occupied territory. In November, Hilary Clinton said \u201cThe United States was\ndeeply disappointed by the announcement of advance planning for new housing units in sensitive areas of east Jerusalem,\u201d describing the new construction\nas \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d Netanyahu\nRajat Jain the current policy of the Obama admin-istration.\nIt also comes at a time when Western\npolicy towards other countries in the region is coming under close scrutiny. The\npotential transition from autocratic dictatorships to popular democracy in the\nMiddle East and North Africa ought to\nexcite liberal democracies. Instead, Arab\npeoples are asking why these govern-ments, particularly the USA, so actively\nhelped prop up these unpopular leaders\nwhose ideology was apparently opposed\nto their own.

The first\nLGBT History Month took place in 2005, in\nthe aftermath of the abolishment of section\n28, a piece of legislation that stated that a\nlocal authority \u201cpromote the teaching in any\nmaintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\u201d. The first ever celebration included over\n150 events nationwide, celebrating LGBT\npeople and the movement towards a more\nequal and open society. The rights and laws\nof the United Kingdom have changed dramatically since decriminalisation; equalising the\nage of consent, allowing civil partnerships\nand adoption for same sex couples.\nIn more recent times, gay rights campaigns\nhave been taken much further afield, some\nbelieve that countries where homosexuality\ncarries the death penalty should be the target of new, fresh campaigns, a belief that is\ncarried by many high ranking politicians and\nhuman rights campaigners. In the UK the\nbattle for gay equality is not over, journalists for reputable newspapers and the Daily\nMail have shown that homophobia still ex-ists, some even suggest that \u201chomosexuals\nare pushing an agenda to turn children gay\u201d.\nThe Daily Mail anti-journalist Melanie Phillips\nseems to suggest that schools would teach\n\u2018gaydom\u2019 in every subject, including teaching why gay people move from the countryside to the city in Geography (a move that is\nsuitably explained by the homophobia they\nrecieve in the countryside).\nMoving towards an equal and open society\nIt is estimated that approximately 10% of\nthe human population are LGBT and according to the Felix sex survey that figure rises\nto 15% at Imperial College; this may be because Felix attracts a rather skewed audience or because the gender imbalance creates some desperation in the crowd. In any\ncase the rights and safety of a minority are\ntaken care of by a number of groups in the\nUnion; firstly, the Union has a LGBT welfare\nofficer who ensures LGBT welfare; they are\nalso a point of call on LGBT issues and sit\non the Representation and Welfare board.\nIQ (Imperial College LGBT) is Imperial College\u2019s LGBT society. Along with running social and welfare events, they have a welfare\nofficer who can provide advice and information for any LGBT issues. IQ have been organising this month\u2019s events and awareness\ncampaigns; you may have noticed a banner\nof famous LGBT icons on the Sherfield walkway and the rainbow pride flag flying on the\nUnion flagpole (and no, the Union flagpole\nis not a code word for Alex Kendall\u2019s....).\nThey\u2019ve also had an exhibition in the business school, with a timeline of LGBT figures\nand historical events spanning from Sappho\nof Lesbo 600BC, all the way up to the recent\nrepeal of the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d.\nFor two years running Imperial College has\nbeen in Stonewall\u2019s top 100 employers due,\nin part, to Imperial 600, who despite sounding like a superhero group, is actually a network of LGBT staff at Imperial College.

Imperial really is the\nsafest place I\u2019ve ever been, I mean I didn\u2019t\ncome \u2018out\u2019 to anyone until I got to my\nthird year here, and joined what was then\ncalled \u201cGaySoc\u201d though you now know\nit as Imperial Queers (IQ). They really\nhelped me through everything and while\nI was afraid to come out to people, when\nI did, I got no \u2018stick\u2019for it. I swear people\nactually became friendlier towards me\nand not in the \u2018EUGH STRAIGHT BOY\nLIKE LESBIAN\u2019 brutish kind of way ei-ther. That being said, Biochemistry is just\nas full of gays now as it was back then...\nsorry I probably shouldn\u2019t say that as a\nlecturer, should I?\nDon\u2019t worry; I don\u2019t think anyone is\ngoing to dispute it. So what\u2019s it like as\na gay staff member?\nAs staff I can\u2019t imagine anywhere as accepting as Imperial, it has really allowed\nme to accept myself and really get back\nall those years at High School where I\nfelt compelled to lie to myself for so\nmany years. Wow, I think I\u2019m getting\nemotional, come on, lesbians don\u2019t cry!\nDo you have any words of encouragement for LGBT students here?\nWell I would tell them to come to terms\nwith who they are, don\u2019t fear anything,\ndon\u2019t fear religion, don\u2019t fear bigots or\nidiots, don\u2019t fear anything and accept\nwho you are and who you were born to\nbe.

Will it cause the\nBank of England to change course? By Sina Ataherian\nA\nmid growing concern\nover the Bank of England\u2019s focus on and\ncommitment to keeping\nits inflation targets, one\nmore committee member joined calls to\nraise interest rates.According to minutes\nfrom the latest monetary policy meet-ing, three members now find \u201cthe case\nfor removing some monetary stimulus\u201d\ncompelling.\nOf the other six members, five (in-cluding Governor Mervyn King), want\nto keep the base rate at its current 0.5 per\ncent, whilst one, Adam Posen, wants to\nincrease stimulus spending by \u00a350 bil-lion.\nOn the pro raising rates side of the\ndebate, Andrew Sentence, the first committee member to start calling for this,\nargued that, \u201cthere was mounting evidence that firms were able to pass on\ncost increases to the prices they set, and\nnoted also that nominal domestic demand had been growing for some time at\nnear to the top of its typical range prior\nto the recession.\u201d\nIn other words, consumer demand has\nnow returned to levels where, even according to static analyses that typically\nfavour inflation in the monetary base,\nthe danger of this causing inflation in\nprice levels is imminent.\nMoreover, \u201cOf those members not favouring a rise in bank rate, some thought\nthat the case for an increase had nevertheless grown in strength.\u201d Even Adam\nPosen indicated he is getting more worried about inflation for similar reasons,\n\u201ca sustained upward trend in global\ndemand prospects, or a shift in sentiment against sterling, could outweigh\nthe domestic forces pushing down on\ninflation.\u201d These fears were summed up\nin the minutes as, \u201cone possibility was\nthat the recent increase in commodity\nprices, which in many cases had been\nassociated with strong growth in emerging market economies, would continue.\u201d\nOn release of the meeting minutes,\nwhich indicate the likelihood of higher\ninterest rates on Sterling in the medium\nto long term, the value of the Pound\nrelative to the US Dollar rose by almost\none per cent, before losing half of these\ngains.\nThis was partly due to the Bank of\nEngland Governor Mervyn King\u2019s\nwarning to investors against assuming\nthat the Bank would raise rates to limit\ninflation. Instead, he suggested that inflation is currently being caused by the\nrecent VAT increase from 17.5 to 20\nper cent, rising commodity prices and a\nweaker pound.\nWhilst investors may have reasons for\njumping on the news of a third man calling for fiscal tightening, as observers of\nthe US Supreme Court have found over\nthe years, no changes are certain until\nyou can count to five. However, analysts are already predicting that Deputy\nGovernors Charles Bean and Paul Tucker may be the next members to stand\nagainst Governor King\u2019s resistance to\nraising rates in the midst of a still weak\neconomy.\nConcerns over central banks\u2019 perceived cavalier attitudes towards inflation are not restricted to this side of the\nAtlantic. On the same day as the latest\nmonetary policy meeting of the Bank\nof England, George Melloan, a former\ndeputy editor of the Wall Street Journal,\nwrote in the paper, \u201cThe Fed is financing a vast and rising federal deficit, following a practice that has been a surefire\nprescription for domestic inflation from\ntime immemorial. Meanwhile, its policies are stoking a rise in prices that is\ncontributing to political unrest that in\nsome cases might be beneficial but in\nothers might turn out as badly as the\noverthrow of the shah in 1979. Does any\nof this suggest that there might be some\nurgency to bringing the Fed under closer\nscrutiny?\u201d\nMeanwhile, rises in oil prices that\nhave resulted from the recent unrest in\nthe Middle East have not help ease fears\nover accelerating price inflation. London Brent has already neared the $110\nper barrel mark at the time of Felix going to press. Worst still, the investment\nbank Nomura is now predicting that,\n\u201cIf Libya and Algeria were to halt oil\nproduction together, prices could peak\nabove $220 a barrel and OPEC spare capacity will be reduced to 2.1 million barrels a day, similar to levels seen during\nthe Gulf war and when prices hit $147\nin 2008.\u201d\nDespite reassurances from the Saudi\nArabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi that\nOPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) would tap into its\nspare capacity of 5 million barrels a day\n(one and a half times the combined production of Libya and Algeria), Nomura\nmaintained that its call may even be an\nunderestimate. An analyst at the bank\neven went as far as to compare the situation for the petroleum markets with that\nduring the Persian Gulf War.\nDespite the varying opinions on how\nthe inflation rate will change in the\nnear future, there is broad agreement\namongst analysts that the next three to\nfour months will reveal whether uncontrollable ratchet effects are going to kick\nin.\nFriday 25 February 2011\nThe estate of Lehman Brothers lost a\nlaw suit on Wednesday against Barclays\nover the sale of its investment banking\nand brokerage businesses to Barclays.\nThe sale was made in September 2008\nin the same week that Lehman filed for\nChapter 11 bankruptcy. The company\nreceived $1.85 billion and was claiming\nin its law suit that the figure should have\nbeen higher. Attempting to raise funds\nto repay some of its $360 billion debt\nto creditors, Lehman has also sued J. P.\nMorgan, Bank of America, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce over\nsimilar complaints.\nLehman\u2019s case was that Barclays had\nmisled the original sales hearing, but the\nFederal Bankruptcy Judge in New York,\nwho oversaw the suit, rejects that claim.\nJudge James Peck wrote, \u201cthe court was\nnot deceived in a manner that should\nnow be permitted to upset the integrity\nof the sale order.\u201d\nThe Judge also took into account the\nurgency of the situation and the perceived gravity of systemic risks at that\ntime, adding, \u201cthe sale process may have\nbeen imperfect, but it was still adequate\nunder the exceptional circumstances of\nLehman Week.\u201d\nBarclays responded that it had done\nthe best it could given the unusual lack\nof time for due diligence on both sides.\nThe Judge agreed that \u201cthe court still\nwould have entered the very same sale\norder because there was no better alternative and, perhaps most importantly,\nbecause the sale to Barclays was the\nmeans both to avoid a potentially disastrous piecemeal liquidation and to save\nthousands of jobs in the troubled financial services industry.\u201d\nLehman is currently considering\nwhether to appeal the ruling, and a\nspokesman refused to comment further.\nLehman loses law suit in US against Barclays\nUnlike the Federal Reserve in recent years, the Bank of England is unused to direct criticism of its policies\n\n"

What a boob.\nCharlie Harvey\nA new type of vaccine for pneumonia based on\ngenetically engineered bacteria has been devel-oped, and may help in the fight against many\nother infectious diseases.\nThe vaccine, which protects against a virulent form of the bacterium Streptococcus pnue-moniae, works by introducing a modifed form\nof the bacterium that produces less pneumoly-sin \u2014 a toxic protein that damages blood vessels in the lungs and interferes with the immune\nsystem. Researchers, from the Albert Einstein\nCollege of Medicine, identified the genetic sequence that codes for the pneumolysin protein,\nand using computer algorithms created a modified gene which would decrease the amount of\ntoxin produced.\nMice exposed to the modified bacteria experienced significantly less inflammatory symptoms\nthan those exposed to the wild type. Most im-portantly, 80% of mice exposed to the modified\nform survived a later exposure to the wild strain.\nTraditionally, vaccines are created with either dead or attenuated organisms, with the aim\nof inducing an immune response, but without\nthe disease inducing properties. Attenuation in\nbacteria has, up to this point, come about by\ninjecting the bacteria into a foreign host. Natural mutations will allow the bacteria to grow\nwell in the host, but subsequently will grow\nless well when injected into humans. The new\ntechnique bypasses this process by designing\nthe mutations using a computer.\nWhile this technique has been succesfully\nused to reduce gene expression in viral patho-gens, the research, published in the Journal of\nInfectious Diseases, is the first to succesfully\nattenuate bacteria.\nCurrently, two vaccines have been created\nfor different forms of Streptococcus using\nthis process. However, as lead researcher Dr\nPirofski points out \u201cthe vaccines don\u2019t cover\nall strains of disease-causing pneumococcus \u2013\nsome of which have recently emerged and are\nvery virulent.\u201d\nThe researchers are confident, however, that\nthe technique they have developed may lead\nto new vaccines. Dr Pirofksi says: \u201cthis idea\nopens up all kinds of possibilities in developing vaccines, not only against pneumococcus\nbut other organisms as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a prick\u201d, cried the little boy\nFriday 25 february 2011\nGenetically engineered vaccination\nKelly Oakes\nYou might not be able to tell from wherever\nyou are reading this, but black holes in the distant universe just shrunk down to as little as a\ntenth of their previous size. This is not some\ncosmic disappearing act; a new analysis of supermassive black holes at the centres of active\ngalactic nuclei has revealed that their masses\nwere previously overestimated by up to a factor of ten. The paper was published in Nature\nlast week.\nActive galactic nuclei, or AGN, are among\nthe most luminous objects in the universe and\nare powered by massive black holes millions of\ntimes the mass of the Sun. Gas clouds, known\nas \u201cbroad line regions\u201d, surround the black\nholes. These gas clouds range from a few light\ndays to hundreds of light days across; they are\nmuch wider than our solar system. Astronomers have been studying these clouds for over\nthirty years, but until now many of their properties remained a mystery.\nWolfram Kollatschny and Matthias Zetzl\nfrom the Institute for Astrophysics, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, looked into\nthe relationship between the shape and width of\nspectral lines observed in the emission spectra\nof AGN. Spectral lines are spikes in the emission spectrum of a luminous object, and represent a peak in intensity of light at a certain\nwavelength.\nHowever, for the broad line regions, it is not\nquite that simple. The regions are spinning very\nfast around the central black hole, and the light\nemitted from them is subject to the Doppler\neffect. When gas rotates around a black hole,\nthe frequency of the light appears to change\nbecause some of the gas is moving away from\nthe observer and some is moving towards the\nobserver. This makes the spectral line astronomers observe broader \u2014 an effect known as\nDoppler broadening. This is the reason the gas\nclouds are called \u201cbroad line regions\u201d.\nKollatschny and Zetzl looked at 37 active galactic nuclei. They worked out that fast rotating\nAGN created broader spectral lines, and slower\nones made more narrow lines. They also saw\nthat faster rotating AGN had flatter gas clouds\nsurrounding them, and slower ones had more\nrounded gas clouds. As they now knew how\nfast AGN were spinning, they were also able\nto come up with new, more accurate estimates\nof the masses of their central black holes. Previous estimates used just the spectral lines to\nestimate masses. This is a problem, particularly\nfor very distant AGN, as astronomers can usually only see one spectral line from these.\nThe new black holes masses came out between two and ten times smaller than the previous estimates. While this isn\u2019t going to cause\nany major problems for the black holes themselves \u2014 they\u2019re still the most massive objects\nin the universe \u2014 it may pose a problem for\nastronomers studying the formation of black\nholes.\nActive galaxy M82 has a supermassive black hole at its centre, and is very pretty\nBlack holes cut down to size\n\n"

I\u2019d moved from\nwitches on to vampires, slightly annoying college kids, the best baddy ever in\nthe form of Glory, and a whole load of\nextra features and ways in which to immerse yourself into the world of Buffy.\nAs if this wasn\u2019t bad enough, I managed to acquire a set of all ten seasons\nof Friends. I\u2019d seen it before (who\nhasn\u2019t?), but let\u2019s face it \u2013 you can never\nget enough Friends. More lab report\ndeadlines, a massive project written to\nthe Rembrandt\u2019s theme tune and another\nyear successfully completed.\nThird year found its entertainment in\nthe form of British Teen Drama, Skins,\nDo people actually\nrevise without the tv\nin the background?\nI\u2019m from Devon. Before then, I was\nfrom Africa. To entertain myself, I used\nto climb trees, go hiking, cycle to the\nbeach, and for a few hours a day, do\nhomework/music practice/mess around\non the computer. I never really watched\nTV, and when I did, I always had something in front of me to keep me otherwise occupied. The transition from college kid to student has shown a marked\nchange in my behzaviour. I\u2019m in my\nfinal year, and, thinking back on it, every year has started and ended with an\naddiction to a new TV show.\nFirst year was Charmed. If you\u2019ve\nnever seen it, eight seasons of witchy\ngoodness, starring Piper, Phoebe, Prue,\nand later, Paige Halliwell. It\u2019s innocent\ngood fun. I get a lot of teasing from people for this one, but I don\u2019t care. It kept\nme occupied during long hours writing\nlab reports, revising microstructures,\nand doing those blasted maths problem\nHow TV has affected my degree\nAngel, the partner series to Buffy, and\nBig Bang Theory. Another huge project\nand exams completed with some memorable tunes in my head, and the associations these all brought.\nFourth year started off with Gilmore\nGirls. Revision for January exams was\ntimetabled according to how many episodes I could fit into a 14 hour period,\nand after these were over I discovered\nGlee (and, of course, the new season of\nSkins started). My flatmate recently got\nthe first five series\u2019 of Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\nand we have started working our way\nsteadily through those.\nSo, what has this done to my degree?\nWell, there are certain things that I cannot write about/think about/discuss\nwithout a flashback to what was on the\nTV at that point in time. Wulff Plots are\nforever associated with Janice and her\nannoying laugh. Every time I have to\ntalk about Crystallography, I get a very\nspecific episode of Charmed in my head\n(I won\u2019t tell you which for fear of spoil-felix\nTELEVISION\nFriday 25 february 2011\ners). In my January exam, I was writing about the cardiac cycle when Rory\nGilmore strolled into my head talking\nabout coffee (perhaps NOT the best timing ever, but hey).\nA lot of my friends ask how I can do\nit. They go so far as to say they would\nnever get any work done with all the dis-traction. I\u2019ve never really thought about\nit \u2013 to be honest, I can\u2019t actually sit down\nand make myself work if there isn\u2019t\nsomething playing in the background.\nYes, this means that I don\u2019t always catch\nthe action, and the finer detail of some\nepisodes is lost on me. It does keep me\nsitting down at my desk, though, when\nI would otherwise be tempted to get up\nand go off somewhere for a little jaunt.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go at the end of this episode, oh no\nwait the next one looks really good, just\none more.\u201d There is no motivation like\nit.\nHas it worked?

    "content": "12\nCOM M ENT\nfelix\nW\nhy did I choose to\nstay at Clayponds\nVillage, the Imperial\npostgraduate hall?\nEasy: I wanted\nto socialise and meet people. It\u2019s been\ngreat fun so far. Welcome Week was\npacked with events, introducing me to\na new gang of friends. The major par-ties, such as the recent Chinese New\nYear, have run smoothly with loads of\npeople attending \u2013 a credit to the man-agers, wardens and student volunteers\nwho made them happen. They\u2019d be impossible without the amenities fund \u2013 a\ncentral fund which uses 1\u20133% of the rent\nfrom each Hall resident.\nWhy impossible? It\u2019s a matter of risk.\nWithout a central fund to draw from,\nevents will only ever go ahead if they are\nzero\u2013risk, like getting together groups\nfor discounts on tickets to a musical.\nHowever, a big event might require a\nmarquee, a band, food and drink \u2013 paid\nin advance. What are the chances of getting over a hundred students to throw\ndown a tenner on an event, six weeks\nahead, which won\u2019t even go ahead if the\nnumbers don\u2019t add up?\nThe issue of Hall rents, and measures\nto bring them down, has cropped up re-cently, and there\u2019s a review to scrutinise\nof the funding in the works.\nUnion president Alex Kendall mentioned in a recent Felix interview that he\nbelieves \u201cit is a fundamental principle is\nthat no alcohol should be funded from\nthe amenities fund... the fact that some\nstudents are subsidising others to drink\nalcohol is, I think, quite immoral.\u201d\nImmoral? Really? The choice not\nto drink is up to an individual; for my\nown reasons, I didn\u2019t drink until I turned\ntwenty. However, it\u2019s ridiculous to say\nthat central funds can\u2019t be spent on\nsomething if a small number of people\nchoose not to take advantage.\nSure, with clubs and societies, grant\nmoney should be spent on the specific\nactivity of the club, not booze. However, the specific purpose of an amenities\nfund is to pay for social amenity in the\nform of facilities and events, and many\npeople in halls enjoy a drink when they\nsocialise. Should we also make it a fundamental principle that we can\u2019t have\nkaraoke at halls events, in case there are\npeople who don\u2019t sing?\nThe argument also ignores the fact\nthat hall residents can have an active say\nin the way the amenities fund is spent.\nDon\u2019t drink? Fine. Suggest and organise a cheap bowling night or theatre trip.\nMost subsidised activities at Clayponds\nare non\u2013drinking; however, some of\nthose with alcohol provided have been\nthe biggest and best attended, by all\nkinds of residents.\nThe character and safety of living in a\nHall is improved by the social cohesion\ncreated when students know each other.\nThat\u2019s facilitated by well\u2013run events\nPlaytime is over\nwhich are cheaper and more accessible\nthan those we can organise on our own.\nWhen I took up my accommodation of-fer, I expected that there would be active encouragement of a community environment by the Hall. There has been,\nand it\u2019s because of the amenities fund,\nalong with a great wardening team.\nThe issue can be solved with greater\ntransparency, which I hope the review\ndelivers (and who would argue against\nlower rent?). Why not show a typical\nfull rent breakdown \u2013 not just of the\n\u2018non-fundamental\u2019parts \u2013 on the accommodation website? If a student doesn\u2019t\nwant to have \u00a32 per week of their rent\ngoing towards a year\u2013long, openly\nplanned social program, they can choose\nto find accommodation elsewhere.\nFor me, that \u00a32 has been the best value\nof my rent package by far. Where is the\nrest going?\nThe social events provided by the amenities fund is the\nbest part of hall life. Why take it out of students\u2019hands?\nDavid Robertson\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nYou can take away our amenities fund, but you can never take our sparklers\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\n\u201c\u201d\nIt\u2019s a matter of risk. Without\na central fund to draw from\nevents will only go ahead if\nthey are zero\u2013risk.\n\u201cFor me, the social\nprogramme has been\nthe best value of my\nrent so far\u201d\nHistory does repeat itself. Earlier this term,\nthe Union shut down the entire IC Radio\nwebsite because of the content of one\nbroadcast and last week the College shut\ndown an entire Union server because of a\nsingle benign sentence and the use of a\ncouple of swear words; if we were to extrapolate by magnitude and ridiculousness, one\nwould expect the government to ban the\ninternet next week when a member of the\npublic is tagged in a particularly unflattering photo on Facebook.\nOf course, while the nature of the College\u2019s response is irresponsible, their impulse to blindly pull the plug at the first sign\nof danger is not without rationale. They have\na duty to uphold Imperial\u2019s reputation and\nthis includes ensuring that libellous, racist or unjustifiably offensive material isn\u2019t\nassociated with this university or its mem-bers. To suggest otherwise would be childish \u2013 our degrees and research rely, in part,\non the good reputation of our university.\nHowever, the College must also remember that it has a reputation within these\nwalls. The move towards an increased role\nof alumni funding is dependent on students today maintaining a positive attitude\ntowards their alma mater. This is not the\nonly reason to act fairly; as Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones\nastutely points out, if Clubs & Societies\ndon\u2019t believe that their online content will\nbe treated proportionally and fairly, they will\nlose trust and move it off the Union servers.\nGiven that the reason to insist that all clubs\nhost their websites on the Union servers\nis so that the College\u2019s reputation can be\nprotected, this breakdown in trust is clearly\nundesirable.\nThe College could simply hold their hands\nup and say, \u201cWe made a mistake.\u201d Indeed\nthe Rector has already apologised for the\nreaction of the College and that apology will\ngo some way to maintain relations. But that\nis not nearly enough. A better and clearer\nunderstanding of the complaints proce-dure, guidelines for removal of content and\nprocess for appeal needs to be built between Clubs & Societies, the Union and the\nCollege. Otherwise these farcical events\nare doomed to be repeated.\nFELIX\nLessons to Learn\nDavid Robertson\nFriday 25 february 2011\nThe Sherfield NatWest is closing and\nthough it\u2019s difficult to feel too sad (one never leaves its dreary premises with a spring\nin their step) the College shouldn\u2019t alter the\nuse of the space. The Santander branch on\nthe walkway alone is not sufficient to serve\nImperial students. Another bank should be\nsought; as long as it\u2019s not a Metro Bank...\nCiao NatWest!\n\n"

The four of us were well\nstocked with chocolate to munch on, believed we\nknew how to use a map, and much good banter en-sued. Perhaps too much, as soon we were facing\nthe fence at the edge of a country house\u2019s garden,\nthe only problem being that we were on the wrong\nside of the fence, having somehow ended up in their\ngarden by accident! The night flew by, we raced our\nway to checkpoints, passing other teams dressed\nas ancient Romans, construction workers, glow rav-ers and the like! Tired but wide grinned we returned\nto the night hike base in time for a hearty cooked\nbreakfast and prize winning...\nThe night hike is an annual event organised by the\nRCC (Recreational Clubs Committee), but it\u2019s open\nto anyone, as long as someone in your team (of\n3-5) is a staff, student, PhD or alumnus of Imperial\nCollege. You get driven from Beit Quad (the Union,\nLondon) out to the great British countryside, armed\nwith a map of various checkpoint locations you decide your own route \u2013 and you can go to as many\nor as few as you like, as long as your back on time\nbefore day light. Of course, the more checkpoints\nyou visit the higher your score, but prizes are on\noffer for things like best fancy dress too. The night\nhike is always a good laugh with friends, and a bit of\nhealthy exercise.\nThis year\u2019s hike is tomorrow, Saturday 26th February, and based amongst the rolling hills of Great\nWindsor Park, Berkshire; navigate your way through\nwoodlands, over hills and between moon lit lakes.\nThere\u2019s still time to enter a team \u2013 just visit the website for more information:\nhttp://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/nighthike/\nThis year prizes will be given out at the RCC bar\nnight, this coming Monday 28 February from 7pm\nin the Union Bar, with great drinks deals on offer.\nJoseph Rumer\nApply to be a Hall Senior\nWith Hall Senior applications now open across\nthe Imperial halls of residence, we thought it\nwould be appropriate to fill you in on what it\nis really like to be a hall senior and our favourite experiences at Wilkinson Hall Eastside.\nAs final year undergraduates at Imperial, we\ncan honestly say it is a worthwhile experi-ence. What first attracted us to apply here was\nthe joie de vivre that seemed to emanate from\nWilkinson! It was a hall that was clearly having\nfun. From the countless numbers of amazing\npeople we have met to the epic events we have\nthrown, living in halls as a senior is an experience not to be missed!\nBeing a member of the warden-senior team\nis a unique experience and not everyone has\nthe required skills-set to fulfil the role. A lot of\nhard work is put into being a senior and we believe the ethos of the halls is built from a strong\nwarden-senior team, reflecting positively on\nthe students who live in the halls. It is really an\nopportunity to welcome in freshers, share your\nexperiences and make them feel confortable in\na new city, starting a new era of their lives.\nThe Wardening team at Wilkinson is one of\nthe friendliest to be found in all of Imperial\n(and no, they\u2019re not bribing us to write this!).\nThey are incredibly supportive of first year\nstudents and have a great sense of humour. It\u2019s\nduring Senior Week that you really get to know\nyour team and in our case, we bonded over\nLaser Quest and played rounders in the rain in\nHyde Park. Moving in day was so much fun\nMevani Jagodage\nto prepare for, especially painting our amazing\nWilkinson logo. We had to also organise a jam-packed schedule of events throughout the year\nto cater to different tastes. A small sample of\nevents: Coming-up dinner at the Rembrandt;\ntrips to the theatre (Les Miserables, Lion King\nand even Cirque du Soleil!); casino night with\nprofessional croupiers; overnight trip to Belgium; free Sunday breakfasts and monthly butteries for the foodies.\nSo what skills are needed to ensure you survive as a senior? The most important is com-munication! Throughout the year you will be\nspeaking to a lot of students, whether it is about\ntheir course, what to do in London or simply\ntrying to persuade them to come to a hall event.\nEnthusiasm is also key, especially when it\ncomes to ticket selling! Creativity is needed\nfor poster making; organisation when planning\nevents; but simply being able to work in a team\nand get along with the many different types of\npeople you will meet is essential.\nIf you think becoming is a hall senior is for\nyou then the deadline is approaching soon. We\nwould definitely recommend it to anyone interested but remember it is not just a way to live\nin halls for another year; we look for serious\ncandidates and only the best are chosen. If you\nwant to make a few hundred new friends and\nlive in a fun environment, this is definitely the\nplace to be! We wish you all the best and look\nforward to meeting you at the Eastside inter-views.\nP.S. In case you don\u2019t know, Wilkinson Hall\nis located in Princes Gardens, a stone\u2019s throw\naway from the gym and the college!\nIt\u2019s always nice when the title of an event pretty\nmuch tells you everything you need to know\nFriday 25 february 2011\nPicocon 2011, the verdict: Fantastic\nLast week I attended my first Picocon, Imperial College Science Fiction and Fantasy Society\u2019s annual one-day convention. Having seen\ncommittee members preparing for months and\nhaving read accounts of previous Picocons my\nexpectations were understandably high and I\u2019m\nhappy to say that I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\nThe day began with fascinating talks from\neach of the three guests of honour. Kari Sperring, a medieval historian whose debut fantasy\nnovel was published two years ago, spoke about\nher early influences from Tolkien and Dumas,\nand how she set out to become a writer. Paul\nMcAuley, the acclaimed hard science fiction\nwriter, talked about how he wrote his books\n\u2018backwards\u2019, starting with a setting and adapting his story and characters to fit it. In particular he concentrated on the outer Solar System,\nthe setting to his landmark novel \u201cThe Quiet\nWar\u201d. Juliet E. McKenna, the prolific fantasy\nauthor, also talked about her writing process,\nfocusing on how SF and fantasy authors need\nto do large amounts of research to make their\nsettings, and whatever magic or science they\nchose to use, seem plausible to the readers.\nThis was followed by a heated panel discussion on the topic \u201cSteampunk, Harmless Fun\nor Silly Self-Indulgence?\u201d, which was joined\nby previous guests of honour Amanda Hemmingway and Jaine Fenn. The panel was quick\nto condemn modern examples of the genre as\nbeing simple nostalgia for the nineteenth cen-tury, ignoring the poverty, dirt and disease of\nthat time. They compared them with earlier\nauthors who used steampunk to highlight problems with society and treated the genre more\nseriously. It was pointed out that many people\ndon\u2019t even consider this new wave of works\nto be steampunk, preferring to call it \u2018gaslight\nfantasy\u2019.\nFor me the highlight of the day was the traditional Destruction of Dodgy Merchandise,\nwhere convention attendees bid at a charity\nauction for the right to take the aforementioned dodgy merchandise home or see it destroyed by liquid nitrogen, bolt cutters and a\nlarge sledgehammer. A notoriously bad Star\nWars TV-movie starring the Ewoks was saved\nfrom the destruction, with the winner promising to send the society pictures of the reaction\nof the person they were going to give it to as a\npresent. One of the highest bids, \u00a340.30, was\nfor scriptwriter and past guest of honour Paul\nCornell to destroy a figurine of the Hulk on\na quad bike. The successful bidder dragged\nCornell out the Union Bar and he performed\nhis task quite admirably, shattering the Hulk\ninto tiny pieces.\nOther activities throughout the day included\na LAN gaming session, which concluded with\na tournament on the acclaimed nuclear war\nsimulator DEFCON. DEFCON\u2019s designer,\nIntroversion, which was founded by Imperial students, provided tins containing its entire\ngames catalogue to the three winners. Metric\nwas filled with stalls selling official Picocon\nT-shirts, books, live action role playing equipment and copies of the award winning anthology magazine \u201cMurky Depths\u201d. The day finished off with a fiendishly difficult quiz.\nI spent more than ten hours at Picocon, surely the best indication of how good it was. All\nof the record number of over 200 attendees\nseemed to share my opinion. If you missed out\nthis year be sure to check it out next time. You\nwon\u2019t regret it.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nIt\u2019s a great chance to be part of a fun community\nYou get to hang out with hot, young Freshers AND avoid the real world?

With the mighty RSM bring\nthe Bottle back to its rightful place\nbehind the Union Bar? Find out on\nMonday. If any of you are taking\nphotos this weekend, we would love\nyou long time if you sent some good\nones to us.\nThe Men\u2019s 1st team are away to\nExter for the BUCS Trophy. Can the\nboys build on their amazing performance over the last two seasons?\nThe Men\u2019s 1st team play King\u2019s Medicals in the ULU Premiership this\nweekend. Can they get a repeat 4-3\nwin from earlier this season, or will\nCaptain Ewan Quince and the rest of\nthe boys give them a good trashing?\nYes, you did read that correctly, our\nnext issue is on MONDAY!\nImperial Gaelic footballers travelled\ndown to Birmingham to meet their counter parts from across the Isles to compete\nin the biggest event on the calendar \u2013 the\nBritish Universities Championships.\nThe infamous weekend of football\nbegan with high spirits and an appropriate meal on the Friday, the general\nmood calm and collected, this with the\nknowledge of a strong and deep squad\nfurthered any previous prospect of vic-tory. A DVD of one of the greatest displays in footballing history, the 2005\nAll-Ireland final, was the catalyst of\nchoice for the evening. Tournament co-ordinator, Shane O\u2019Hanlon, phoned and\ninformed captain Fitzpatrick of some\nregistry issues, IC had to forfeit three\npivotal players, Sean Dunne, Will Seez\nand club stoat, Frank O\u2019Neill. Though a\nscar on the face would not damage any\ndesires for IC, the reliable squad members Paddy Heugh, Luke Johnston and\nToby Davies stepped in and ensured a\nstrong starting team for the morning.\nA 5am start is never a pretty experi-ence, throw in some Baltic conditions,\na driver who hasn\u2019t heard of a clutch or\ngears lower than 3rd and an angry Yettie\nMcCann - it\u2019s not anymore prepossess-ing. Having said that, the sky became\na lighter shade of grey and tunes were\nbanging as the men powered up the M1,\nthe humour loudened. Like wizards they\narrived precisely when they meant to,\nready for the tournament of the year.\nIn the draw the night before Imperial were pulled out of the hat alongside\nLincoln, Sterling, Rennes and Teesside.\nHaving no idea of what the competition\nwas like, even having played Sterling\nthe previous year, nobody can guess\nwhat the turnover of players is like; it\nwas imperative to watch all the games\nand devise some tactics from the side-line. So it began, game one.\nLincoln 0:00 \u2013 0:03 Imperial\nThe awkward debacle of the two teams\nsporting royal blue was resolved by a\ncoin toss forcing IC to play in an un-spoilt, all-white away kit. McCann and\nRoche harmonized to win the initial tussle at the throw in, a ball was delivered\ndirectly into the arms of Niall O\u2019Hara,\nMcCann followed on and his work was\nrewarded with a fine score from 20\nyards. This early dominance and networking between the midfield and forwards tamed the opposition for a while.\nFitzpatrick floated one over from a set\npiece, thereafter was replaced by Luke\nJohnston due to a niggling hamstring.\nThe rest of the first half was more of a\ntennis rally with no team able to penetrate the others defense.\nWith IC only two points up going into\nthe second half, it was imperative to get\nmore scores on the board as a goal for\nLincoln would have put them in the lead.\nThe solid wall of Clancy and O\u2019Driscall\nin the full back line cancelled any scoring opportunities that arose for Lincoln.\nImperial\u2019s all important score came\nwhen an accurate kick out from Harry\nEvans was won by the determination of\nDoolan; rising above his man, beating\nhim and laying it off to playmaker Niall\nO\u2019Hara whom after selling a handsome\ndummy pointed from distance.\nChanging back to Blue, Imperials next\nopponents came in the form of Scotsmen\nSterling 0:00 \u2013 2:03 Imperial\nUnable to win the opening battle, Sterling got in on the breaking ball from\nthe throw in \u2013 a shock to system for\nthe Blues however the defense bounced\nback and disposed the Greens. The IC\ndefense governed the play in the first\nhalf, Mick McGarvey, O\u2019Hare and\nJames S. snatching any loose balls coming their way, coinciding with the strong\nhands and determinant runs from player\nof the tournament, Paddy Comerford,\nthe IC forwards could do some dam-Gaelic Sports: Football\ngo to Birmingham\nage. Introducing danger man Heugh into\nthe full forward line ensured two robust\ngoals from his left boot, conserving his\nreputation.\nThe adversaries were ruthless, though\ndirty in their tackling so gave away many\nfouls and those closer to the goal mouth\nEd Fitzpatrick confidently, could ease\nthe frees between the posts and over the\nblack spot.Doolan eventually added the\nterminating point to the scoreboard with\nEvans keeping yet another clean sheet.\nThe following game would best go\nunmentioned even in The Times. Opponents were in the form of the well-travelled French team minus one or five,\nroll up the Rennes Ten.\nEdward Fitzpatrick\nFind out how they did in the rest of the\ntournament in next week\u2019s Daily Felix\nWhat\u2019s that? You want to know what happened next, find out next week\nA\ns another year quickly\nslips before our hands, it\nis already February and\nfor the Royal School of\nMines it is one of the\nmost important months of the year. It is\nthe month when the Bottle Match falls\nand is a weekend looked forward to by\nall past and present Miners, but what is\nthe Bottle Match and where did it start\nfrom?\nFor those not in the know, the Bottle\nMatch is actually quite old\u2026to be precise it is 109 years old this year and is\nthe 2nd oldest university varsity match\nin the country after Oxbridge! The match\nis between the Royal School of Mines\nagainst their constant rivals in Cornwall,\nCamborne School of Mines. The match\nbegan in 1906 on 16th December 1907\nwith the two sides battling it out on the\nrugby field for respect and glory for their\ninstitution. It wasn\u2019t until 1926 that the\nvarsity match got its name, when some\nRSM students stole a 3 ft Bottle from a\nBass Brewery lorry (showing students\nhave always been badly behaved\u2026in\ncontrary to many newspapers\u2019 views of\nstudents) and this was adorned with the\ntwo colleges\u2019 crests and presented as a\ntrophy for the winners of the match. The\nBottle Match was born!\nWith time the match slowly started\nto incorporate more sports to show the\ndiversity of the colleges with football,\nmens & ladies hockey, squash, and golf.\nThere are trophies for all the sports ranging in age from the Sharpley Cup presented by a RSM alumnus in the 1950s\nfor the Mens hockey winner to the Golders Cup that was presented by the Golders Association in the 1990s. This may\nseem like the match is stagnant but new\nsports are being added to the varsity\nmatch and helping to invigorate the atmosphere with new blood. Netball was\nadded last year and this year Basketball\nis being trialled for the first time.\nLast year was a disappointing year for\nthe RSM with only the newly formed\nNetball team winning their game against\nCSM. Even the Royal School of Mines\nRugby team that tends to always retain\nthe Bottle, with them winning the bottle 12 out of 14 years that included a\n10 year winning run from 1997-2006, went onto lose 13-0 in a\nbitter boggy game. However with\nlast year in mind, all of the RSM\u2019s\nteams have being training hard for the\nBottle Match with some success stories\nthroughout the season including ladies\nhockey coming second in their league\nand vying for promotion again. The football team making it all the way to their\nULU division cup final. And finally the\nrugby team looking stronger, faster and\nmore deadly than ever before (I\u2019m sure\nMartin Johnson will enforce the England\nrugby squad to watch the Bottle Match\nfor tactics and inspiration before their\ncrunch game against France that day).\nSo we look forward to the weekend\nwhen over 180 players will com-pete, more than 200 supporters will\nattend and\nh o p e f u l l y\nthe chant \u201cOh\nRSM\u201d will be resounding well into\nthe night at Metric.\nSchedule\nFRIDAY 25TH FEBRUARY\nBasketball - 18:00\nNetball - 20:00\nSATURDAY 26TH FEBRUARY\nLadies Hockey - 09:00\nMens Hockey - 10:30\nFootball - 12:00\nThe Bottle Match - 14:00\nAftermatch party in Metric\nfrom 21:00\nSPORT\nBen Moorhouse previews the 2011 Bottle Match\n\n"

Every crew entered were in the top\nten of their event, 111 BUCS points were won from\nthe club\u2019s performance in the Championship events\nand the medal haul was impressive with 4 golds, 2\nsilvers and 4 bronzes awarded.\nIt was an early start on the cold wet Saturday\nmorning as the ICBC Novice Squadron made their\nway to Peterborough for the first day of racing,\nwhich is dedicated solely to Beginners. Once assembled on the boggy banks of the river with boats\nrigged, the Team Chat was given by coaches Don\nMcLachlan, Stu Whitelaw and Dougie Thoms. The\nfirst races were for the women\u2019s four (Harriet Cross/\nMaddy Whybrow/ Rosie Davies/ Sarah Tattersall/\ncox: Libby Richards) and the men\u2019s eight (cox: Jess\nJohnson/ Tommy Hirst/ Tom McArdle/ Xavier Lorrain/ Tom Carpenter/ Alex Quigley/ Mattieu Burnard-Galpin/ Robbie Hernandez/ Reuben Hill). As\nthey boated, with the rain pouring down, the 2.5km\nrace ahead suddenly seemed much further.\nAll was going well in the men\u2019s eight as lengths\nof clear water were put on crews around them until the final 500m, when an unfortunate crab by\nthe strokeman cost the crew valuable seconds and\nthey finished 8th in their category. In the meantime,\nthe women\u2019s four were storming down the course,\navoiding crews crashing all around and crossed the\nline, snatching the bronze medal in the process. In\nthe second division, four further members were added to the women\u2019s four to make the eight (Cox: Alice Wickham/ Rowena Harrison/ Tattersall/ Davies/\nElizabeth Richards\n...Continued on Page 31\nBoat Club\nbring in 111\nBUCS points\nRio Stoddart/ Cross/ Joanna Taylor/ Whybrow/\nLucy Adkins) who came 9th overall. In the mean\ntime, the men\u2019s four (Hirst/ McArdle/ Lorrain/ Carpenter/ cox: Johnson) were hindered once again,\nthis time off the start, by some \u201cweek-old novices\u201d\nand yet still managed to take 6th place.\nOn Sunday, the senior rowers awoke to dry skies\nand all were feeling relatively positive. On arrival\nat the course, it was obvious why the locals refer to\nit as Peter-bog-rough Head; the field had become\na mire overnight. Unaffected, all of the seniors\nboated for the first division. The Championship and\nIntermediate head is run over double the distance\n(5km) of the Beginner Head and, immediately,\nthe squad started as they meant to go on, bringing\nhome three golds and a bronze. The lightweight\nquad (Tom Pearson/ Tim Richards/ Wilf Kimberley/ Gareth Brown) was the fastest boat of the divi-sion, winning their category in 11 seconds ahead of\nevery other. The coxless four (Danny Bellion/ Henry Goodier/ Matt Whaley/ Rory Sullivan) won their\ncategory by another convincing 9 seconds ahead of\narch-rivals, Durham.Another gold was won by IC\u2019s\nIntermediate coxed four (Adam Seward/ Jake LeaWilson/ Matt Lunt/ Paul Jones/ cox: Jess Johnson,)\nwho overtook the boat ahead within 200m from the\nstart. The Championship coxed four (Simon Steele/\nAlistair Hudson/ Ben Spencer-Jones/ Leo Carrington/ cox: Libby Richards) started first in their\ndivision and brought home the bronze medal.\nAs soon as the first division was complete, preparation for the second began. Frantic re-rigging\nof the lightweight quad to a coxless four and the\nheavyweight four to a quad was required once the\nboats were off the water.

The smell\nof bullshit is what is putting you off your\nfood. It\u2019s emanating from that quote in\nan inverse square law (a joke for my\ngeeks out there, peace out G-TOWN).\nThis was an all male orgy, meaning the\nquote must have come from a man. This\nbacks up my claim that it\u2019s bullshit. You\nsee \u2026 men lie all the time. If it\u2019s not a\nlie, it\u2019s an exaggeration. Here are some\nexploratory examples to ponder:\n\u201cRegional manager for a large corporation\u201d = \u201cStarbucks assistant store\nmanager\u201d\n\u201cMate I got with her\u201d = \u201cShe hugged\nme at the end of the night.

That is a good ques-tion, well done for asking. You see, for\nthe first hour or so men are just too\ntired and dazed to lie frequently. Lying is mentally straining, and first thing\nin the morning is too early. As the day\nprogresses the lies pile up. If someone\nhas done an all nighter, they most likely\ndon\u2019t even believe what they\u2019re saying\nany more.\nThat\u2019s not very detailed is it? You\nwant more detail don\u2019t you?

The rest is\nvarying lies about sexual prowess.\nThe number of participants gives it\naway as a lie. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re making up results for a lab report. A 30 person orgy would be too round a number\nso they just took off three. It\u2019s still way\ntoo high, seriously, 27! How fucking\nbig was that bed!

How the fuck do you\norganise a 27 all guy orgy anyway? You\ncan\u2019t exactly make a Facebook event\ncan you.\nDo you call everyone up? It\u2019s not like\nyou can text around is it. If you have\never organised a night out, you know\nthat you need to get different groups of\npeople to come if you want a large num-ber. People will only go if a group of\npeople are already confirmed. The real\nquestion is: how do you pitch that to the\nfirst guy you call?

So one poor guy might have been left\non his own, just watching, wondering\nwhy no one wants to explore his insides,\nor be explored by him. Poor guy. I bet he\ngrows a beard and looks shifty at airports\nin the hopes of getting a cavity search. I\nreckon his doctor no longer believes that\nhe is a \u2018hypochondriac\u2019 and therefore\nneeds so many prostate exams.

    "content": "A R T S\nFELIX\n14\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nKelly Osborne recommends an\naward-winning adventure story\nwhich explores spirituality alone on\na boat with a tiger.\nWhich books will get us through to the end of term?\nTell us about your favourite in 300-400 words and\nsend it to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLooking for a thought provoking but comfortable and\neasy read? Look no further. A book which should not\nbe rejected for having pi in the title. Don\u2019t worry,\nthere\u2019s nary a mention of the ratio of a circle to its\ndiameter between its covers.\nLife of Pi follows the unusual adventures of the\nhero Piscine Patel (named by his parents after a\nparisian swimming-pool), through his childhood\nand his later unsuccessful migration to Canada.\nNot just a narration of the story, the book takes a\ndeeper look into philosophical issues, addressing\nreligion in its several forms.\nPi himself has dabbled in a selection of faiths,\nillustrative of his inquisitive and progressive nature\nthat creates a character so likeable that the reader\u2019s stake in the story becomes more than that of\na mere observer, Martel manages to completely immerse us until the character feels like a friend, in a\nway that causes us to dangerously invest ourselves\nin the story.\nThis may sound thoroughly pretentious and un-interesting, but the addition of a Bengal tiger (aka\nRichard Parker), an orang-utan and a long lived\nshipwreck spices things up halfway through. The\nsecond half becomes an epic journey through the\nAtlantic and the realms of insanity before reaching\nits both frustrating and deeply disturbing conclu-sion, that (rarely for a book, I find) leaves the reader\nsatisfied.\nThe book won the Man Booker prize despite being\nrejected by almost half a dozen publishers before\nfirmly lodging itself into print. This could be due to\nthe simplicity of the novel and possibly the slightly\nambling start \u2013 but those who put it down at this\nearly stage are as foolish as those who think that\nbananas can\u2019t float.\nby\nYann Martel\nLife of Pi\nWill Prince\nPersonally, I thought Al Gore had flogged the\nclimate change donkey for all it was worth.\nMost people recycle now, protesters have found\nnew things to riot over and we have a Liberal\nDemocrat as Minister for Climate Change \u2013 the\nwar seemed, to all intents and purposes, won.\nWas I wrong? Is climate change killing us?\nWill someone I\u2019ve heard of ever play Metric?\nWill we ever find out? Personally, I don\u2019t know\nbut I\u2019m sure the Rector has it all in hand.\nOne thing I can say with semi-certainty, is\nthat green plays are the new black on the theatre scene. After several years of mulling over\nthe issues during sweltering dog days and\ngrindingly cold winters, the playwrights have\nput pen to paper and heralded the forecast for\n2011.\nThe first among the new wave is The Heretic,\na play very close to the interests of Imperial\nstudents. Not only is it showing at the ever-reliable Royal Court, barely a post-code away\nin Sloane Square, but it explores the story of an\nEarth Sciences Professor and her struggles in\nthe face of a ruthlessly competitive scientific\ncommunity, the courtship of corporate sponsors and an equally volatile, vulnerable family life at home. The key difference being that\nDr. Diane Cassell is a climate change skeptic,\nswimming against the current, and confident in\nher views. (Check Monday\u2019s Daily Felix for\nGreenland, the NT\u2019s own stab at global warming on stage).\nI\u2019ll confess I was a little crushed upon realising it was set in Yorkshire \u2013 not as close to\nPrince Consort Road as I had at first hoped \u2013 but\nI was quickly assuaged by Juliet Stevenson\u2019s\nauthoritative performance as Diane Cassell, the\nrobust, assured scientist, as her life begins to\nunravel after she receives death threats from\nmilitant eco-activist groups. Through exchanges with her anorexic daughter, her hapless boss\nand a bright yet emotionally delicate student,\nwe see a woman defend her principles in the\nface of a world that disagrees with her, beyond\neven the scientific.\nRichard Bean and Jeremy Herrin, as writer\nand director respectively, have crafted a very\neconomical piece in The Heretic. Its efficiency\nwith cast and set is worthy of commendation\nand the script metes out tight punches of well\nobserved, sardonic comment that maintain the\nflow of the piece throughout. The script\u2019s targets are wide and varied, Richard Bean doesn\u2019t\nDo you believe in Science?\nseem afraid to poke a bit of fun at anyone in\nthe name of humour \u2013 Muslims, media studies students and James Lovelock beware. The\ncast are arguably suited to their characters;\nJames Fleet, famed for playing bozo Hugo in\nthe Vicar of Dibley (a smash hit UK sitcom that\ndefined a generation, for the international readers out there), brings the same disarming goofi-ness to Professor Maloney, the head of depart-ment, and Johnny Flynn carries the satire of the\ngreen-fiend student well, without ever pushing\nthe character into the ridiculous.\nWhilst it is centred on climate change, the\nplay takes on more of the guise of a romantic comedy \u2013 not to give too much away \u2013\nwhich makes Quentin Letts\u2019 review tagline of\n\u201cHooray! This will make the right-on brigade\nhot and bothered\u201d in the Daily Mail all the\nmore distressing. The Heretic isn\u2019t going to\nwin round Al Gore, it wasn\u2019t written to win\nround Al Gore. It is thought-provoking and\nheart-warming (what would a positive theatre\nreview be without those two?) but is by no\nmeans scientific polemic and towards the end\nhas touches of fairy tale that would dissatisfy\nthe scientist in anyone. If you\u2019re as of yet un-convinced, go simply for the Jeremy Paxman\ncameo. No joke.\nAt The Royal Court Theatre until 19th\nMarch, \u00a38 for under 25s.\nThe Heretic, a stone\u2019s throw from Imperial, asks about\nevidence and whether climate change is our new religion\n\u201cIf you\u2019re unconvinced,\ngo simply for the Jeremy\nPaxman cameo. No joke.\u201d\nThis character is the leading environmental researcher and climate change sceptic,and she\u2019s explaining about polar bears apparently\nFriday 25 february 2011\n\n"

The roster was uncertain as many\nplayers had other commitments, including exams the following day. Nevertheless a strong\nteam showed up at Oxford, ready to take the\nfight to the Vikings.\nWithin moments of the match commencing\nDevils\u2019 Centre, D. Belair (81), was called for\nroughing and proceeded to the sin bin. The\nDevils held out for the Penalty Kill, and shortly\nafterwards D. Belair scored his first (unassist-ed) at 7 minutes. The Vikings, perturbed, conceded again within minutes to first-time scorer\nTim Runcorn (36) Club President, assisted by\nLohner (67) and Grant (14). Determined not to\nconcede again, Oxford woke up and contested\nthe puck much more for the rest of the period.\nDespite several opportunities including Power\nPlays, the Devils could not add to their lead.\nIn the absence of Coach Coolegem, it fell to\nTeam Captain Ed Grant to analyse the situation\nat the intermission. The focus was to convert\nmore of the opportunities into shots and shots\ninto goals. The team clearly took this onboard\nas the Devils scored again within 5 minutes, by\nBenani-Kamane (2). At this point the Vikings\nwere visibly angry and with the Devils making good but fair physical play they were determined to hit back. Increasingly heated play\nculminated in a nightmare for the Devils with\na simultaneous double penalty to Benani-Kamane and S. Belair (1) for roughing. In a disastrous 5 on 3 situation it was seconds before Oxford netted a goal. With one penalty cut short,\nthe Devils were able to hold off 5 on 4 until\nback to full strength. Benani-Kamane shortly\nmade up for his transgressions by slotting a\nfourth goal for the Devils to increase their lead.\nThe intensity remained high but the period ended with no more penalties, just a parting goal\nby Benani-Kamane to make a hat-trick, this\ntime assisted by Grant.\nComfortably 5-1 up the Devils were cautious\nabout relaxing and knew they would be tested\nin the third period. This proved to be the case\nas 1 minute into the third Oxford scored. Another penalty for S. Belair for cross-checking\nand Oxford capitalised on the Power Play to\nscore a third. The game seemed to be slipping\naway, especially as Goalie Collins (38) had\nbeen making some great saves. However, before long Oxford were similarly penalised for\ncross-checking and D. Belair scored on the\nPower Play, assisted by Halford (77). Back in\nthe hunt, more raw passion was dumped into\nan already heated game. Roughing was called\ntwice, once against Oxford and moments later\nagainst the Devils. The Vikings, if not already\nbeaten, were subsequently broken as D. Belair\nforced a breakaway and scored a short-handed\ngoal. With tension mounting by the second\nIce Hockey: Oxford falls to\nthe power of the Devils\nNetball: Fantastic fours\nsurreptitiously steal the\nshow...\nVictory rarely tastes so sweet as when you\nspend 59 minutes behind on goals, only to seal\nthe deal in the dying seconds. The ICs 4s appetite was whetted for the run up to the end of\nthe season when they did just that against their\nvisitors, Queen Marys 4s.\nThe writing was on the wall, as these gorgeous girlies, in short skirts and tight lycra,\nfaced defeat against QM 3s just eight days ago.\nKeen to get our own back, we were disappointed to lose the centre draw and concede straight\noff the first whistle, but were determined to\nkeep our chins up and our heads in the game.\nGrit and determination was rife on the faces\nof the home side, and as the pressure started\nto mount on the visitors, things started to get a\nlittle heated.\nThe first quarter was end-to-end; a close finish with QM up 9-7, but with everything still\nto play for.\nTactical changes saw Captain Emma Oakton\npush forward to centre and impact sub Chloe\nMan come on to strengthen the defence. Despite our best efforts, the strength of the QM\nside was evident and they began to break away\nto finish the first half up 22-16.\nThe IC half time talk needed to muster up\nimmense courage and resilience to hold off\nthe QM offensive. It really was a game of two\nhalves, with IC basking in the limelight now.\nDeep in defence, Alex Hamilton repeatedly\nplucked the ball from the air and Laura Elliott,\nwith her long, tanned legs, leapt to intercept.\nSabrina Maas tracked back well on the QM\ncentre passes, her luscious blonde hair blowing in the breeze, giving their WA no room to\nmanoeuvre. And what a performance in attack,\nwith Ayumi moving beautifully around the\ncircle and Nancy Edge receiving the well-de-served accolade of Player of the Match.\nThe frustration of the visitors culminated\nwith their chunky WD, on losing the ball to an\nIC free position and in a fit of rage, slamming\nthe ball at the feet of our shell shocked WA,\nFeroza Kassam. This resulted in a two goal\nsending off; a punishment rarely seen in ULU\nNetball.\nThis didn\u2019t do much to stifle the temper of\nQM nor the fiery passion of IC, and the final\nquarter saw the home side knocking on the\ndoor to victory. The wise adage, \u2018it\u2019s not over\ntill it\u2019s over\u2019 really rang true, with the IC ladies\ngaining ground in the last quarter; suavely scoring the winner as the final whistle blew.\nFeroza Kassam\nNetball\nIC 4s 27 - 26 Queen Marys 4s\nnerves ran high and the final play resulted in\nan interference penalty for Oxford and a 10\nminute game misconduct against Devils\u2019 Benani-Kamane. At 2 seconds remaining this was\npurely academic and the game was another victory for Devils A.\nEveryone stop! My contact lens has fallen out, I know its around here somewhere\n\n"

Jane Neary, Director of\nCommercial Services, Denis Wright, Dean of Students and John Anderson, Chief Executive Office of\nthe College Fund were present at the meeting with\naround 20 postgraduate students.\nThe general feeling after the meeting was posi-tive.

Haralambos Dayantis\nNEWS\nFELIX\n4\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs the future nuclear?\nRory Fenton\nOn Thursday 17th February, three of the UK\u2019s\nleading experts on nuclear power came to Imperial to discuss their pet subjects in a debate\norganised by A Global Village; Imperial\u2019s\nglobal affairs journal. Joining the debate were\nProf Jim Skea OBE, Director of the UK Energy\nResearch Centre, Prof Gordon MacKerron, Director of the Sussex Energy Group and Chair\nof the UK Committee on Radioactive Waste\nManagement and Neil Hirst, Senior Policy Fellow in Energy Mitigation and Climate Change\nat the Grantham Institute at Imperial.\nAlthough the title of the debate was \u2018Is the\nfuture nuclear?\u2019 all three experts quite clearly\ndid agree that the UK\u2019s future would require\nincreased nuclear power capacity. The real\nquestion was, how much should we invest in\nnuclear and how far do we have to go to make\nit safe? Prof. Skea started by stressing that the\nneed to decarbonise the UK\u2019s electricity supply\nis undeniable, targeted to be completed in 20\nyears. However, he insisted that while nuclear\npower had its role to play, renewable should\nmake up a significant part of the energy mix.\nHe was sceptical of the role that fossil fuels\ncould play in a low carbon energy future for\nthe UK, pointing out that Carbon Capture and\nStorage (CSS) was \u2018yet to be demonstrated\u2019.\nNeil Hirst took a much stronger stance,\nsaying that we need nuclear power in order\nto achieve Copenhagen\u2019s \u201cfantastically difficult\u201d target of limiting global warming to 2\ndegrees. He quoted figures from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which\nprojected that ruling our nuclear power would\ncost the world\u2019s governments an extra $6 trillion by 2050 in order to meet current climate\nchange accords. Once new generation reactors\nare built, he said, nuclear will be the cheapest\nsource of energy for the foreseeable future,\nwith the occasional exception of gas. As for\nthe issue of waste management, he insisted\nthat \u201cproperly managed and regulated forms of\nwaste disposal are safe\u201d, admitting that \u201cwinning support for waste solutions remains a big\nproblem\u201d.\nProf. MacKerron presented a markedly more\nsceptical view of nuclear power. His own introduction to nuclear came in the 1970\u2019s when\nhe conducted a study showing that coal was\ncheaper than nuclear power. Although he accepted that new generation plants should be\nmore efficient, he pointed out that they seldom\nstick to projected costs. A new reactor in Finland, he pointed out, was 50-70% over budget and already 3 years behind schedule. He\nalso took a stronger stance on waste disposal,\nquoted the late Lord Flowers, former rector of\nImperial, \u201cthere should be no new project without a sustainable waste plan\u201d. He also said that\nindustry should be made to pay for any nuclear\nwaste cleanup operation.\nMuch else was discussed at the debate. It was\npointed out that while nuclear power does increase the UK\u2019s energy security, most of our\ngas doesn\u2019t actually come from Russia, as is\noften thought, but from much friendlier Norway. If nuclear was to be used as effectively as\npossible, the experts agreed, the way in which\nwe use our energy must change. Cars which\nrun on petrol cannot be run by nuclear power\nand yet contribute to a significant amount of\nCO2 emissionl; only when more cars are electric will nuclear power succeed in reduce emissions from this carbon-intensive sector of the\neconomy.\nProfessor McKerron duelled with members\nof the audience who accused nuclear power\nplants of having a huge hidden cost; that of de-commissioning. He argued that decommissioning should cost around 10% of the total investment required in a plant and should be funded\nby companies setting aside a pot of money\nfor this purpose. Neil Hirst was keen to stress\nthat the only danger posed by nuclear reactors\ncomes from those built in less stable countries\nwith low quality research and regulation but\nthat this is simply not the case in the UK.\nFollowing a lively Q&A session with the au-dience, a vote was taken. Is the future nuclear?-the overwhelming majority of the audience said\nthat yes, it was. Hardly a surprise at Imperial,\nperhaps. But as to how much to use and how to\ndeal with the waste; these issues were left to be\ndiscussed over the free after-event orange juice\nand beyond.\nI\u2019m concerned about the colour scheme that\nthey\u2019re using here...\n...Continued from Front Page\nFriday 25 february 2011\nIn Brief\nCollege meets with postgraduates\nto hear accommodation concerns\nBeit cash machine removed\nloss of the on-campus branch. Sharon Bolton,\nHead of International Student Support at the\nInternational Office, is concerned that only one\nbank on campus isn\u2019t sufficient to serve international students. Although there are a range\nof banks close to campus, these branches do\nnot have the same student (and particularly\ninternational student) expertise and close relationship with the College. In the International\nStudent Barometer survey, for students starting in 2010, sorting out bank accounts was the\nleast satisfying experience for international\nstudents; a problem likely to be exacerbated if\nbanking services on campus are reduced.\nThe closure also affects the Union, who hold\ntwo accounts with NatWest, one of which is\nfor Clubs & Societies. They are looking into\nother precautions such as hiring a security firm\nto transfer cash from their commercial services\n\u2013 the bars and club \u2013 to other NatWest branch-es. Deputy President (Finances & Services),\nRavi Pall is also considering the idea of letting Clubs and Societies pay into the Union \u201cto\navoid the unnecessary risk of students carrying\nlarge amounts of cash to South Kensington or\nGloucester Road.\u201d\nOther banking services on campus were removed last week. Lloyds TSB took away the\ncash machine from the Union building, citing\nlow profitability according to a Union spokes-man. The Union say that they offered to pay\nfor the cash machine service but were unable to\npersuade Lloyds to keep it. They are currently\nFrom left: Prof Gordon MacKerron, Neil Hirst and Prof Jim Skea OBE\nChristopher Walmsley\nsearching for other banks to replace the ser-vice, with Barclays expressing interest. Until\na replacement is found, students will have to\nwalk to the Sherfield building or get up to \u00a320\ncashback from the Union bars (providing they\nreach the \u00a35 minimum card spend).\nThe International Office say that they are\nmaking extra efforts to work with branches\nnear campus to ensure that they are sensitive\nto student banking issues. The impact of the\nloss of a NatWest branch that has such a close\nrelationship with the College will inevitably\nbe a big one, but with different options being\nconsidered by Imperial College and the Union,\nhere\u2019s hoping that the effects won\u2019t be too serious for Imperial students.\nNatWest declined to comment on the closure.\nTom Welch\nUnion elections hot up\nThe number of students running for positions has\nballooned in the last week. Maamoon Hussain is\nnow challenging Monya Zard for Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) while three candidates (Jehan\nPasangha, Mevani Jagodage and Nicolas Massie)\nhave decide to run for the previously uncontested Deputy President (Welfare) position. There is\nclearly a lot of interest in the election with three\ncandidates already receiving over 100 nominations\neach. Nominations close on the 28th of February\nat 23:59.\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/elections\n\n"

The Union\nreacted angrily issuing a statement calling the shutdown \u201coverblown and unnecessary\u201d and accusing the College of\nfailing to follow proper procedures.\nThe main Clubs & Societies server had\na ban placed on its primary IP at 13:30\non Thursday 17th February by ICT Security for just under an hour. This resulted in all Clubs & Societies websites\nbecoming inaccessible, along with the\nroom booking system and the eVoting\nsite currently accepting nominations for\nSabbatical elections. The shutdown is\nlike to have caused significant disruption to students attempting to participate\nin the elections or book rooms for their\nClubs & Societies; as a comparison, in\nthe hour before the shutdown, the server\nreceived 14,429 page requests.\nThe offending article in question was\na match report of Imperial Rugby Club\nOld Boys recent victory against London\nNew Zealand II\u2019s in the Middlesex Merit League 1 competition. It contained the\nuse of the word \u201cfuck\u201d on two occasions\nand made indirect reference to a member of the public.\nUpon reading the article, Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones\nand President Alex Kendall concluded\n\u201cthat there was nothing offensive, and\ncertainly nothing illegal about [the article.]\u201d However, the member of public\ncomplained that the article was libellous.\nBefore shutting down the server,\nemails were sent to the Union President\u2019s personal Imperial account.

The closure will force the\nCollege to change some of its financial\nprocedures; the Commercial outlets on\ncampus pay approximately \u00a37 million in\nnotes and coins into the branch annually.\nMalcolm Aldridge, Financial Controller of Imperial College London, says\nthat the main aim for the College it to\ndetermine how the closure of the branch\nwill affect Imperial financially as well as\nto ensure that it won\u2019t negatively affect\nImperial by taking significant security\nprecautions\nHe declined to comment on whether\nanother bank would replace NatWest,\nsaying that no dicussions had been had\nyet. However, with three months until\nthe bank closes he is confident that the\nCollege\u2019s financial operations will not\nbe negatively affected.\nBut it does seem that International students may be affected the most by the\nRAG tradition revived: Page 2\nn e 1949\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nce\ne\ne\ne\ne\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nce\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n19\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n94\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\n"

Despite this, the girls managed a very respectable sixth place and increased the\ntotal BUCS points. It was then their turn\nto de-rig and re-rig their quad to a four\n(Symmonds/ Connell/ Duffy/ Graham)\nand rapidly returned to the river for\ntheir next race, which they successfully\nsmashed to bring home another bronze\nmedal for the club.\nBy the time of the third division, 10km\nhad already been raced flat out by many\nmembers of ICBC, and yet the most important race of the day (to many) was yet\nto come \u2013 Men\u2019s eights. On the way to\nthe start, both ICBC crews kept the pressure light to let the aching legs attempt\nto recover before smashing it down the\ncourse for a second or third time. The\nIntermediate eight (cox: Johnson/ Pearson/ T Richards/ Bellion/ Lea-Wilson/\nSeward/ Brown/ Lunt/ Jones) had an\neventful finish to the race as they ambitiously attempted to overtake two crews\nat once but unfortunately this ended in\na clash with Newcastle, causing Lunt to\ncrab and break his footplate in one fell\nswoop 200m from the finish. Despite the\ntheatrics, the bronze medal was theirs.\nThe Championship eight (cox: L Richards/ Whaley/ Sullivan/ Spencer-Jones/\nGoodier/ Steele/ Hudson/ Kimberley/\nCarrington) were confident in their own\nabilities and Whaley urged the boys to\nfocus on their rowing and rhythm and\nsee just what they could do. The crew\nlooked solid down the last 750m, holding their form, and were praised and\ncheered on from the bank. All the effort\npaid off and the silver medal was theirs,\nbehind the Cambridge Blue Boat, all of\nwhom had not raced earlier in the day.\nIn one of the club\u2019s most successful weekends, Imperial was the second\nuniversity overall and every senior man\nwalked away with a medal from each\nevent he entered. At the start of the Head\nRace season, all wait with baited breath\nwhat ICBC can achieve next.\n...Continued from Back Page\nI\u2019m sure there are supposed to be other boats racing against us...\n\n"

    "content": "13\nfelix\nCOMMENT\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\nI\nfeel for nurses. I don\u2019t mean the\nsort of nurses who wear fishnets\nand appear readily in a Google\nimages search, I mean the sort\nwhich work in hospitals up and\ndown the country. After a recent report\nfrom a nursing ombudsman, this profession is in for yet another bashing for\nreasons I can only think of as spurious.\nThe recent accusations that are levelled at nursing staff in particular relate\nto a small number of very select cases,\nwhere nurses have been accused of poor\ncare for dying patients. You will understand that as a scientist I am suspicious\nimmediately.\nOf course it is difficult to watch someone die, especially if it is a loved one who\nis, by definition, irreplaceable. It must be\nimpossible to know what to do or where\nto look or what to say. Perhaps that is part\nof the problem. Should people who are\nnot trained in healthcare, healthcare provision or even medical science and who\nare in an emotional state be in the driving\nseat on NHS reform?\nNursing can, of course, be done badly.\nBut this applies to teaching, train driving\nand fox hunting as well though. That,\nas we have seen is not a good enough\nreason to lay into it. The trouble is that\nnurses will not fight back. They are a\ncompassionate race who, like medics of\nall kinds, are blamed when things do not\ngo the way a sick person, or the relative\nof one, may wish them to. Let us try to\nlook at it from the nurses\u2019 perspective.\nThey have hospital policy, a boss, a consultant (or more than one) and innumerable guidelines to satisfy. And you can\nbet none of them went into the profession for any of that.\nEven on a practical level, you have a\nward of people needing your attention,\ndo you attend to them or do you sit at\nthe deathbed with the family? It might\nsurprise you to learn that relatives interviewed seemed keen for nurses to sit\nthere with them without consideration\nof other duties. With the best will in the\nworld, and even if it were practicable, is\nit reasonable to consider that this is what\neveryone wants?\nAll the cases are littered with such\nincongruities to the point at which one\ncannot determine whether or not any\nmalpractice was evident. Healthcare\nstaff of all sorts do a magnificent job,\nusually under very difficult circum-stances. Will working against them in\nthis way help anyone\u2019s healthcare? I\nthink not.\nSamuel Furse\nWhy attack nurses?\nDear Sir,\nI would like to comment on Alex Kendall\u2019s views on the social amenities fund.\nHe mentions that he is fundamentally\nopposed to amenities funds paying for\nalcohol and food at social events. I\ndon\u2019t believe he fully appreciates that\nthe funds are there to support socialis-ing and for the vast majority this involves enjoying a drink and food. He\ntries to make parallels with union clubs\nand how they have banned the buying\nof food and alcohol. However, this is a\ncompletely separate issue as the funds\nfor union clubs come directly from Imperial college fund and therefore should\nnot be used on socialising as the money\nthey receive is allocated for the buying\nof consumables. The fund for the hall\namenities comes from the residences\naccommodation fees which imperial\nCollege has no input into. Therefore,\nthe residences should decide how they\nspend their money and not imperial college union. This is the reason we have\nhall committees.\nI have been a member of the hall\nLetters\ncommittee at Clayponds, which is\nformed of hall residences alcohol and\nnon-alcohol drinkers from the halls I\nlive in, for nearly a year now and I have\nnever heard anyone say that they are\nopposed to using the funds to buy alcohol or food. In fact I can use a parody of\nmy own which highlights the absurdity\nof the argument Alex is trying to make:\nI am allergic to nuts but I don\u2019t expect\nnuts to be banned from social events,\ninstead I choose not to eat them and\ntry the alternatives that are available.\nThis is the same issue I have with the\ncomments that Alex has made about\nalcohol. If I didn\u2019t drink I wouldn\u2019t expect other people to not drink, instead I\nwould drink alternatives that are always\navailable such as lemonade or cola.\nHe was elected to represent the views\nof the students but I believe he has failed\nin his ability to grasp the views of the\nstudents he is supposed to represent. I\nthink he should stop his egotistical, ill\nconceived views from spoiling our social events and let us decide how we\nwould like to spend our money.\nYours sincerely,\nAdam Cribbs\nAmenities fund\nFriday 25 february 2011\nFINDI,SCIENCEATALLNORMALFELIX\nDISTRIBUTION POINTS\nA FELIXPublication\nF\nFI\nIND\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nDI\nI\nI\nI,\n,S\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nSC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCI\nIE\nEN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nN\nNC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nCE\nEA\nATA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nAL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nLL\nLN\nNO\nO\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\nDI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nIS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nS\nST\nT\nTR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nRI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nIB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nBU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nU\nUT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nX\nXP\nPub\nbl\nli\ni\ni\ni\ni\nic\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nc\nca\na\na\na\na\na\nat\ntion\nX\nX\nI,SCIENCE\nTHE SCIENCE MAGAZINE OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nnext issue out 11th march\nFIND I, SCIENCE AT ALL NORMAL FELIX DISTRIBUTION POINTS\nA FELIXPublication\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX 21\nFinally, a SimCity destroyer?\nFriday 25 february 2011\nC\nities in Motion is a complex transport simulator\nbased on a simple concept\n\u2013 you have to build and\nmanage the public transport system in a city. While this isn\u2019t the\ntype of game I\u2019d usually opt for, I decided to take the plunge and take a look\nat what it had to offer.\nBut first, I have to make a comment\nabout the specification that this game\ndemands \u2013 I had major problems getting the game to run smoothly (or\nat all). On my laptop (powered by a\n2.27GHz i5) the tutorial crashed every time and the campaign was utterly\nunplayable \u2013 the screen updated about\nonce a second. Even when I installed\nthe software on my gaming rig there\nwere still huge issues. Enabling anti-aliasing would cause masses of slowdown if using the mini-viewport (an\narea of the window where you could\nmonitor a selected point on the map),\nand disabling it caused display problems with some vehicles \u2013 I was presented in places with a blank, white\nspace that would only be drawn when\nand where the vehicle intersected with\nit. Disabling HDR lighting solved the\nproblem, and while the game looked a\nlot dimmer and less dynamic without it\non it was the price I had to pay to have\na fully functioning game.\nWith all the settings sorted, Cities in\nMotion is a very good-looking game.\nThe textures are detailed, with realistic-looking buildings and interesting variation between individual cars. The behav-image of your company. It all adds to the\nexperience, making it fuller and richer\nthrough the realism and immersion.\nAlongside the campaign is the sandbox mode which, when coupled with\nthe quite frankly amazing and comprehensive map creator, is where enthusiasts will probably spend most of their\ntime. You can use one of the existing\nmaps from the campaign, or one of your\nown creations, to build a transport system from scratch \u2013 with no restrictions\nother than the budget you set yourself.\nThe lack of objective may not appeal to\nall, but those looking to form the perfect\ntransport system will surely be challenging themselves in this mode.\nI have to say, Cities in Motion impressed me. It was a lot more feature-packed than I expected it to be, and once\nit was working properly it provided a\nmostly enjoyable playing experience,\nespecially with the little features that\nmade everything feel that little bit more\nimmersive. It\u2019s certainly a game that I\u2019ll\nbe picking up again soon, even though\nit may not have made me a convert to\nthe genre.\nFelix Games would like readers to be\naware that we played a pre-release\nbuild and the graphical problems\nencountered are likely to have been\nfixed in the release edition.\nCities in Motion is available now from\nParadox Interactive and Collosal Order for PC.\nChris Bowers reviews Cities in Motion, the most detailed mass transit simulator yet\n\u201cYou\u2019re given a lot\nof freedom when it\ncomes to deciding\nhow best to run your\nsystem\u201d\nIt quickly gets more complicated\nhowever. Cities in Motion has complex\nunderlying mechanics that make it not\nonly more interesting but also more\nchallenging. Customers will soon become dissatisfied with things like having to wait too long for a bus (I certainly know that feeling\u2026), and this\nwill damage your company\u2019s reputation\n\u2013 an integral part of keeping people us-iour of the water particularly impressed\nme, especially with accurate-looking\nreflections that get perturbed by the\nripples in the water. Overall, the game\npresents a very pretty spectacle.\nOf course, the gameplay is a lot more\nimportant than how good the game\nlooks. The tutorial gives a good introduction to the various aspects of the\ngame, even with the slight niggle of\nhaving to click a green question mark\nbutton at the bottom of the screen to see\nthe \u2018objective complete\u2019 message and\nthen again to look at the next objective.\nOnce I had finished with the tutorial, I\nwas ready to delve into the game proper.\nThe main objective is to have a well-equipped, customer-satisfying and profitable public transport system running in\nyour city. With transport options including buses, trams, and the metro (which\ncan run on up to three underground lev-els, at ground level, or elevated above\nground level), you\u2019re given a lot of freedom when it comes to deciding how best\nto run your system.\n\u201cThose looking to\nform the perfect\ntransport system will\nsurely be challenging\nthemselves here\u201d\ning your transport links. As time rolls\non, you are offered objectives that, if\ntaken and completed successfully, will\ngive you a reputation boost as well as\na healthy cash bonus. These add more\ndirection to the game and help to keep\nplay flowing.\nIn between these objectives I had time\nto notice the little things about the game\nthat made a big difference. The attention\nto detail in the game is excellent. Occasionally a fire will break out, requiring a\nfire engine to go out to the scene, traffic\nwill start to build up in an area, which\ncauses irritated drivers to start beeping\ntheir horns, and more besides.\nThe realism doesn\u2019t stop there: fare\nprices and staff wages can be altered for\neach method of transport, with obvious\neffects on your happiness if set incor-rectly. You can look at the global economy growth on a map, apply for a loan\nfrom a bank if money is tight, and even\nstart a marketing campaign (with different types of campaigns appealing to\ndifferent society groups) to improve the\nAll we need now is a giant lizard and Matthew Broderick and we\u2019ve got ourselves a blockbuster\nFootball and an athletics track? Ah man, I wish the London 2012 stadium was gonna be this good...\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX\n18\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nChristopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nAlbum of The Week\nRadiohead\nThe King of Limbs\n2011\nThe extremely hyped Radiohead\u2019s first release since\n2007\u2019s In Rainbows has finally made it into the public\u2019s hands (and ears) and, as usual, it caused plenty\nof agitation. Fans religiously waited for its entrance\nin the cyber world and synchronously unveiled Thom\nYorke\u2019s band\u2019s 8th release and mixed emotions were\nthrown in all directions. Ranging between brilliancy\nand average-ness, consensus has yet to be reached.\nThis has also been caused by the step back attitude\ntaken by the Music Review behemoths. Therefore, I\ndecided to add to the pile of personal, uninteresting\nand un-experienced reviews and controversy:\nThe King of Limbs is nothing new. For me it sounds\nexactly like a dubstep mash-up of In Rainbows with\nThom\u2019s solo album. It is short (four years to make\n37 minutes??) and sounds like there are only two\nsongs (the first five and the last three). It is easy to\nlisten to but not that catchy. It is nicely done but way\nbelow par for such a brilliant band. You forget it was\nput together by the creators of OK Computer and Kid\nA, you even forget you are listening to it at all. If the\nphysical release of the album brings nothing more to\nthis pot, my final verdict is that it is quite disappointing to see that the only band that has consistently\nchanged and awed the music world for the past 2\ndecades might now be losing it.\nNot because the album is not good, it is (had it\nbeen created by some xx-meets-burial\u2019esque band\nand it would be a revelation), but because this is\nRADIOHEAD we are talking about! The day they stop\ndazzling you is a sad day for music in general, it is\nthe same day you stop believing in it.

Her crowd engagement was particularly\nimpressive, as she encouraged people to dance\nat the appropriate moments (a lesson The\nFlaming \u201cmotherfucking\u201d Lips could learn),\nevoked call and response and even returned to\nthe stage to dance to the audience chants of\n\u2018Ladyflash\u2019 after the song had finished. Having\nsomething exciting to watch on stage is a useful way of turning a good concert into a memorable concert, so having Ninja jumping all over\nthe speakers, strutting around the stage, high\nkicking and pulling shapes certainly added to\nthe experience.\nThe setlist was a combination of the first and\nlatest albums and drew from the best of their\nrepertoire, using a concoction of distorted\nguitars, chanting, hip hop samples, crashing\ndrums and charming woodwind solos. They essentially only had two types of songs \u2013 cute,\nmellow, childish songs sung by Kaori or Chi\n(\u2018Secretary Song\u2019, \u2018Ready To Go Steady\u2019) and\nbrash, shouty, bombastic songs rapped by Ninja (\u2018Titanic Vandalism\u2019, \u2018The Power Is On\u2019),\nbut that\u2019s all they need for everyone involved\nto thoroughly enjoy themselves.

They kept the momentum going throughout, using noise freakouts to\nfill the space between songs and finally finished\nthe set on \u2018Rolling Blackouts\u2019, which prompted\nNinja to mount several of her bandmates in an\nattempt to steal their instruments (of course).\nI can\u2019t rate any other band more highly for\nlive performance and considering that there\u2019s\nbeen talk of this potentially being the last Go!\nTeam album, it\u2019s an experience to see as soon\nas possible.\nWhen you go to see The Go!

Such guidelines\ninclude investigations into the \u201coverall\ncoherence of each degree,\u201d the \u201cuse of\nassessment and provision of feedback\u201d\nand \u201cimplications on student satisfac-tion, applications, and position relative\nto competitors.\u201d\nIn terms of the timetabling of the\nreview, the related information corresponds with previously reported state-ments, with the review period stated\nas lasting from January until March.\nA draft review document is due to be\ncompleted by early March, with the co-chairs explaining in their message that\nthere will be a further period of consul-tation. \u201cAnonymised\u201d student responses\nwill be attached as an appendix to this\ndocument.\nFollowing this, a response to the review document will be completed in\nearly April. Mid to late April will see a\ndeadline for proposals to be submitted\nto the Science Studies Committee ahead\nof the panel reporting to them on May\n17th. The final process will be a senate\nmeeting on June 17th. It is hoped that\nthe new intake of student in October\n2011 will be the first to see changes during their degrees.\nHowever, not everyone is satisfied by\nthe responses provided by the review\ngroup. In his online sabbatical blog on\nFebruary 11th, Union President Alex\nKendall responded to the impending\nrelease of the terms of reference, noting\nparticular concern in the fact that they\nwould not contain any reference to the\nplanned restructure of the Life Sciences\ndepartment: \u201cThe teaching review appears to simply be taking a long view\nabout teaching without trying to fill in\nthe 25% loss in teaching time in both degree streams, or replace any of the lost\nadministrative positions.\u201d\nKendall was previously critical of last\nmonth\u2019s questionnaire and its lack of\nmention towards the restructure.\nFelix contacted Purvis and Selkirk\nabout the relationship of the restructure towards the teaching review and\nreceived the following statement: \u201cThe\nreview of teaching that is currently\nunderway is something that all departments do from time to time, in order to\nmake sure their degrees remain relevant\nand up-to-date.\u201d The co-chairs then categorically stated that, \u201cIt is not part of\nthe restructure.\u201d\nThis will no doubt raise some questions amongst opponents of the restruc-ture, many of whom held the expectation that the teaching review would\nhave some bearing on impending job\nlosses.\nMatthew Colvin\nPresident attacked for amenities fund comments\nImperial halls of accommodation were\nthe subject of much heated debate this\nweek following the Union\u2019s announcement of a survey to see how the rent for\nHalls could be reduced. In particular\nUnion President Alex Kendall\u2019s comments about the halls amenities fund,\nwhich is paid from rents and used to sub-sidise social events, have been roundly\ncriticised with students forming a Facebook group to resist the scrapping of the\nfund. The survey has been delayed until\na \u201ca full breakdown of costs [can be re-ceived] to put the other measures in perspective,\u201d according to Alex Kendall.\nIn an interview with Felix last week,\nKendall argued that \u201cno alcohol should\nbe funded from the amenities fund\u201d and\nwent on to say that it was \u201cimmoral\u201d that\nsome students were subsidising others\nto drink. His comments were met with\na vehement response that highlights the\nimportance the matter holds to students:\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he fully appreciates that\nthe funds are there to support socialising\nand for the vast majority this involves\nenjoying a drink and food,\u201d wrote Adam\nCribbs, a hall committee member at\nClayponds. (Letters, Page 13).\nKendall responded to the criticism\nby saying that he had not called for the\namenities fund to be abolished, \u201cwhat I\nam against is it being spent on alcohol,\u201d\nhe said. However, he said that the point\nof the survey was to gauge student opinion on such matters and that he would\nnever \u201cimpose [his] opinion without student support.\u201d\nFrom the initial debate, it doesn\u2019t seem\nlikely that there will be student support\neither for scrapping the amenities fund\nor for prohibiting subsidising alcohol.\nOpinion so far suggests that students\nbelieve that the money spent makes a\ncritical contribution to life at halls. Craig\nCourt, creator of the Facebook group \u201cI\nam against scrapping the Imperial Amenities (social) Funds\u201d, voiced his concerns that \u201cwithout the amenities fund,\n[\u2026] large events that are provided for\nresidents to make new friends and meet\nnew people (especially in the welcome\nweek) could not be provided.\u201d\nSome hall wardens like Dr Dan Read,\nbelieve the best method to cut down\ncosts is to look at the budget as a whole,\n\u201cto ensure that the costs are justified\nand that money is not being wasted on\nexpensive outsourced cleaning, maintenance contracts etc.\u201d\nCuts have previously been made by\nabolishing hall senior discounts; John\nJames, Deputy President (Welfare) last\nyear warned that \u201cIn this economic\nclimate we have to make cuts and [...]\nfunding Hall Seniors is not sustainable\u201d.\nSimilarly a wardening review is due to\ntake place to address the costs of Hall\nwardens and negotiate a deal.\nOverall, the measures to try and reduce\nrent have been positively received; how\nthis will be realised, conversely, is a contentious issue. Excluding the overheads\nfor utilities rent when broken down is\ndependent on 5 factors; as Alex Kendall\noutlined: \u201cEthos, the Amenities Fund,\nCleaning, [\u2026] the contract length and the\ncost of wardening.\u201d Reduction in one or\nmore of these costs will have the desired\neffect of reducing accommodation costs.\nKendall argues \u201cstudents are concerned about hall rents, so the Union has\na duty to at least make them transparent,\nif not reduced.\u201d The union\u2019s decision to\nconduct a survey is to understand student opinion and then tackle the issue of\nsteep hall fees. \u201cI was approached by\nseveral wardens [\u2026] who raised concern that Ethos was part of the rent but\nno one knew about it. [\u2026] Regardless\nof our personal beliefs, it is right to ask\nstudents about the amenities fund.\u201d\nThe greatest fear is that the social\naspect of living in halls and university\nwill suffer as a result of reduced funds\nto reduce rents. If the amenities fund is\nindeed scrapped, then socialisation may\ndepend on residents\u2019 willingness to pay\nextra for events. So far, the College has\ndeclined to comment, saying that they\nwill wait for the results of the survey.\nBut as it has been delayed, students will\nhave to wait a little while longer to have\ntheir say about this contentious area.\nMadhura Ghosh\nCorrection\nThe correction printed last\nweek (Issue 1483 \u2013 18/02/11)\ndid not include Nigel Kheng\nWei Hehn\u2019s name in full. Felix\napologises for this.\nEditor\nKendall says subsidising alcohol from the amenities fund is \u201cimmoral\u201d\nMiles Robertson\nMatthew Colvin\nauthor of the article, criticised the College\u2019s response saying: \u201cI thought it was\na bit over the top, there wasn\u2019t anything\nbad in the article and it certainly wasn\u2019t\nlibellous!\u201d He said that it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to take down the entire server.\nHeather Jones warned that the events\nwould make it more difficult to persuade\nClubs & Societies to host their websites\non the Union\u2019s server, as required by the\nUnion\u2019s web policy: \u201cIt is impossible to\npersuade clubs to host websites with us\nif College can\u2019t be trusted to allow them\naccess when it\u2019s required,\u201d she said.\nEarlier this term, IC Radio was shutdown after a complaint was made to the\nRector\u2019s office about the use of a racial\nslur on air. In that incident, the complaint was passed to the Union, who\nthen made the decision to take down the\nentire website to show \u201chow seriously\n[the Union] considers racially offensive\nlanguage\u201d. The website was back online\nwithin 24 hours.\nThe Rector has apologised to the Union\nfor the reaction of the College. The Union\nhave said that they are working to form \u201ca\nmore coherent procedure for the future if\na member of the public complains about\ncontent on the Union website.\u201d\n...Continued from Front Page\n\u201cIt is impossible to\npersuade clubs to\nhost websites with\nus if College can\u2019t\nbe trusted to allow\nthem access\u201d\n\n"

In three rounds of the American game show Jeopardy, based on participants\nmastering wordplay to answer general knowledge questions, a pair of skilled human contestants were roundly defeated by a machine - a\ntestament to the distance artificial intelligence\nhas come since chess Grandmaster Gary Kasparov\u2019s epic six game battle with Deep Blue in\nthe late 90\u2019s.\nThe conclusion of half a decade\u2019s efforts,\nthe victory by IBM\u2019s \u2018Watson\u2019AI program is a\nmassive achievement, one that was considered\nvirtually impossible in 2005. The complexity\nof Watson\u2019s system lies not in the knowledge\nof trivia; Watson has been endowed with a 4\nterabyte data repository (that\u2019s roughly 512\nWikipedias, for reference).\nConquering the complex wordplay that the\ngame show is based on, often requires contestants to draw together pop culture references,\npuns and even slang to merely understand the\nquestion. For example, \u2018This term for a long-handled garden implement could also be used\nto describe an immoral pleasure seeker\u2019. (The\nanswer, if you are wondering, is not \u2018What is\na hoe?\u2019, but \u2018What is a rake?\u2019. Look it up on\nWikipedia.)\nWatson proved to be more than able at this\ntask, breezing through the three rounds having amassed a grand total of \u00a347,923 (\u00a330,000\nmore than his nearest human challenger). At\neach stage when the question was revealed to\nthe contestants, a text file containing the question was sent to Watson. On opening the file,\nWatson would run through a series of algorithms in parallel to try and discover the an-swer, with his confidence in his response de-Free App of the Week\niOS - Beluga Messenger\nThere are quite a few chat apps on the iPhone, but\nBeluga does one thing the iPhone\u2019s not great at:\ngroup chat.

Group chat done right.\nAndroid - Beluga Messenger\nAI geek bests human rivals\nFeroz Salam\nYou\u2019ve got a laptop bag, but what about an\niPad bag? It might seem like an odd concept\nto have a bag just for your iPad, when you can\nfit it in almost any bag you\u2019re likely to be car-rying. But that hasn\u2019t deterred be.ez from releasing an iPad version of it\u2019s LE rush line of\nlaptop bags, the En Ville.\nMade from pretty sturdy nylon, and available in three colours, the En Ville is about the\nsame height and width as an iPad, but almost\nfour times the depth. There\u2019s a nylon non-re-movable, but length adjustable shoulder strap\nfor carrying the bag, which feels just like a\nseatbelt, and is attached at the sides.\nThe main zippered pocket has a separate\niPad compartment, a middle section for other\nthings, plus two slip pockets for ancillary stuff.\nThe front of the bag has a Velcro pocket with a\nzippered pocket inside it, containing two slim\nslip pockets, two more separate slip pockets\nGot a laptop bag, how about a tablet bag?\nSamuel Gibbs\npendent on the number of algorithms that came\nto the same conclusion.\nHow Watson compared to his human rivals\nis a matter of some debate. Watson\u2019s circuitry\nmeant that he could often buzz in dramatically faster than his two distinctly fleshier op-ponents, and his vast data bank was optimised\nsolely for the purpose of playing Jeopardy. Yet\nin his defense, he had none of the decades-long training in natural language that Jeopardy\nchampions and opponents Ken Jennings and\nBrad Rutter enjoy simply by being human. In\nthat aspect, it\u2019s probably fair to argue that Jennings and Rutter were playing a completely different game to Watson; the former testing their\ntrivia skills while the latter tested his English\nlanguage skills.\nSo what does IBM have planned for the\nyoung linguistic master now that his Jeopardy\ndays are over? Watson more than served his\noriginal purpose, convincing the US public\nthat IBM are still at the forefront of solving\nsome of the world\u2019s toughest computing prob-lems. Yet running Watson as is in any other\nsituation would probably be highly impracti-cal. For the moment, IBM has announced that\nthey will be exploring the use of similar software to aid medical diagnoses and legal re-search. The truly exciting possibilities of the\nsoftware lie well in the future though - many\npersonal computers today can play more efficient chess games than specialist chess computers of the 90s.\nFor a six year old idiot savant whose only\nskill is an American game show, Watson\u2019s\ndomineering performance has served to bring\nAI and robotics back to the forefront of our\nimaginations but his legacy will lie in how far\nhis performance goes towards bringing computers that understand the intricacies of speech\ninto our homes. We\u2019re used to chess-playing\ncomputers, but if things go to IBM\u2019s plan it\nmay be time to prepare for your GP being a\ncopper and silicon box somewhere in Iceland.\nand a keychain clip. While you can\u2019t fit anything particularly thick in there, the bottom of\nthe pocket expands a little from its streamline\nappearance, accommodating something about\nthe same size as a wallet. The back of the bag\nfeatures a slim poppered pocket, ideal for\nsomething you need quick access to.\nThe sides and bottom of the back feature\nsome thin but quite robust padding, helping\nkeep the contents secure if you happen to drop\nthe bag, while the nylon construction proves to\nbe fairly weatherproof.\nOf course the En Ville is quite small as\nshoulder bags go, and you can\u2019t fit a whole lot\nin there, but if you just want to carry your iPad\nand a few bits and bobs, the En Ville is about\nas accomplished as an iPad-only bag could\nbe. On whether anyone really wants a bag just\nfor your iPad, the jury\u2019s still out. But if you\u2019re\nafter one, the LE rush En Ville is a solid con-tender, despite the obscure name.

The\nwussy little twat isn\u2019t tough enough.\nClearly not marriage material.\nCancer\nThis week, you challenge a grown man\nto a game of \u201cEye Spy\u201d. He\u2019s not very\ngood at it, he keeps drinking coffee and\ntalking about his relationships. No matter how hard you try, he refuses to stop\nbeing a boring twat. You stab him in the\neye with a unicorn. LADADADADA!\nLeo\nThis week, you are the Rector. It\u2019s totally cool because you\u2019re legally allowed\nto bang any College staff member whenever you want. Oh, you hadn\u2019t heard of\nthat rule? It\u2019s always the way. You never\nfind out about the \u201cRector Rectum Regulation\u201d until it\u2019s too late...\nVirgo\nThis week, you hope that nobody finds\nout that The Daily Felix is a complete\nhoax. It\u2019s like April Fools but more subversive because we\u2019re doing it in Feb/\nMarch. On every page we\u2019re actually\njust printing the word \u201cLOL\u201d beneath a\npicture of the Rector getting pied.\nLibra\nThis week, you hoped to be done by 12 on\nWednesday night but good Horoscopes\nrequire patience. Like letting a fine\nwhiskey \u2018air\u2019 or waiting for that girl you\nlike to leave her house before you follow\nher down the alleyway and BAM! you\u2019ve\nrevealed too much about last night...\nSagittarius\nThis week, you scrap a Bieber related\nhoroscope because it was shit and instead\nfocus on that sensation on your knee. Oh\nGod! Justin Bieber is licking my knee!\nWhat do I do? Can I keep him? (In an unrelated matter, if you have a cellar going\nspare, email felix@imperial.ac.uk)\nCapricorn\nThis week, you cook a big bowl of\nspaghetti, shove as much slippery pasta\ninto your mouth as is physically possible\nand wake your girlfriend up by trying to\ngo down on her. She screams and tries\nto wriggle away before accepting the\nbolognesy goodness...\nAquarius\nThis week, it\u2019s you against the clock.\nThe clock\u2019s just edging ahead. He\u2019s\na total charmer and the girl is about\nto fall for him. It\u2019s time for drastic\nmanoeuvres. You take off your shirt,\nbeat your chest and say, \u201cME MAN,\nYOU WOMAN.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work.\nPisces\nThis week, you\u2019re out late at night. The\nstreets are empty. It\u2019s eerily quiet. Your\nfriends are wearing hooded cloaks. \u201cIt\u2019s\ntime,\u201d they say, \u201cto stop playing WoW.\u201d\nYou have no say in the matter, they ritually sever your arms. You\u2019re like \u201cWTF\nDUDE? chill out! jeez...\u201d\nNational Rail pledge to use rulers\nwhen laying train tracks\nDRUNKEN MATE\nOF THE WEEK\nThis is one of those awesome situations where the guy playing the prank ends up looking like a bigger douche\nthan the person being pranked. What\u2019s the thumbs up for? Are you \u2018going in\u2019?\nFELIX 25\nFriday 25 february 2011\n\n"
