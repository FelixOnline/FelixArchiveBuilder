After the May Ball there appeared a considerable quantity of ob jets d 'art which not only used up much of the\nGym but also left permanent proof of their presence on the floor.\nIn particular there was one specimen of 'op-art' about six foot long and half an inch deep which, short of a new floor, is there for ever.\nAs I 've said before the gym may not be very good( in fact it is appalling, but that's another tale) but it's the only Gym we have or are going\nto have for along time to come.

Only Mar riot of\nthe I.C. bowlers was successful in containing them. When I.C. batted a collapse rapidly set in against what was really only mediocre bowling.

The mountaineers are going to freeze in Greenland and\nlite zoologists to boil in Nigeria. A party of\nthe Underwater Club will be based on\nMalta whilst another group is looking for\nlost mines in Bolivia.\nSnout to be surveyed by Mountaineering; Club The mountaineering club is going to\nGreenland to study the Mount Furel group\nof peaks in Eastern Greenland. They hope\nto make a particular survey of the Snout\nwhich has not been covered before. Their\nmain difficulty will be with transport because the area is situated quite a long way\ninland on a tricky route. They will be flying\nto Kulusak where they will be faced with a journey of about a week, if all goes well,\ninto the interior. They have been lucky in\narranging an airdrop of supplies which\nshould help to remove a lot of the humping.\nTnis is the only expedition for a couple of\n\\ ^ars; which will be ' operating in what used to\nbe the traditional l area for expeditions from\nImperial College. For many years there was an\nunbroken succession of expeditions which went\nto Arctic areas but in recent times the explorers\nhave preferred wanner climes.\nGrasshoppers in Nigeria\nfemale zoologist Irene Ridinig is leading an_ fit-member party into the forests of Nigj&ia\nto study grasshoppers. They have been invited\nby a zoologist at the University of Ife to work\nunder him. While they are there they will try\nto fit statistics to grasshoppers and to study other\nparasites. Nigeria and the rest of West Africa,\nhave attracted many College expeditions in the\npast.\nPhysical phenomena of Malta\nOnce again the Under-Water Club has i picked\nthe plums of the climates and is going to spend\nthe summer swimming off Malta. Unlike previous\"\nUnder-Water Club expeditions this one will riot\nbe biologically based but will be studying\nphysical phenomena. Diving has been developed\nto a great extent now ana p ne of the limiting\nfactors in further development is the ability or\ndivers to communicate. This\\ expedition under\nBrian Ray, a physics Post-Graduate, will be\ntrying apparatus for communications using voice\nfrequencies.

A career\nin such a firm should be secure\nand well-ordered.

    "content": "FELIX\nComment by the\neditor\n\" THE TIME HAS COME On trivia 1\nhave commented during the P* sl eight\nmonths; now to consider the year as a whole, undeterred by any rumours that a certain student newspaper editor is standing\nfor office in ICU. First of \" kings\". The tragedy of a weak students' representative Council is that few, if any, important decisions are made \u2014 and the\ndanger is that these few maybe bad. This year'sCo un qi l has been very lax about the\nUnion's dwindling Sport Centre reserves, and its strength has la in almost exclusively in the bulldozing character of President Fletcher. It is said that power, corrupts and so rarely has he met his match that his domination has grown and his later work has borne the marks of weariness.\nThis domination was probably caused largely by his long-overdue reforms at the beginning of the\nsession that were to lead to more streamlined\nCouncil meetings. Most important of these\ninnovations was the presentation of briefs to\nall members some days before a meeting that\nwould enable them to be fully aware of the facts, and give them opportunity to conduct further private investigations. In practice,\nhowever, these reports have been either not\nread or read and the reader become bored; in consequence the few interested parties who have raised questions on reports at Council have tended to be shouted down by others\nwho have been bored.\nThe only member of Council to continually?[ u est ion Fletcher's chairmanship has been ormer Deputy Barry Man. Of him Fletcher has seemed persistently contemptuous, and at\ntimes sought to make of him a laughing stock.\nFletcher shares one characteristic with Scott->he is a showman; whereas Scott chose to\nmimic Mick Jagger, \u2022 Fletcher revels in his rolling gait across the Be it Quad. At last term'sIC WA Formal he wanted to appear on stage\nwith the four Carnival Queen candidates to\na sparsely-populated Concert Hall. Full marks to I CW A President Jane C aud well for flattening him on this point as she had previously \u2014\nand even more dramatically \u2014 on the question\nof whether or not College secretaries should also contend for this crown. Fletcher has always maintained that he is against\npolitics in the students' union. Hardly surprising really, since that would have drawn opposition against this year's biggest union politician \u2014 himself. In this manner he was almost brilliant in the Felix split affair at the\nend of January; he engineered what he wanted \u2014 a temporary end to anonymous columnists\n\u2014 FELIX is fighting for a new constitution\nand maintaining the 1956 policy statement\nthat \" Your Union Council cannot dictate to\nyou through the paper.\" Williams in retrospective mood\nBut these have not been his only challengers,\nof whom my main criticism is. two-fold\u2014we\nhave lacked confidence and we were never\nunited. Even now, eight months on, these\nfaults are still only too evident However,\nthe exodus of Fletcher is nigh.\nIn all fairness though. I should just point out\nthat h'e has given the Union a strength that\nwould otherwise have been lacking. For all\nhis faults he has perhaps been the best ICU President in the past four years.\nOf this year's \"princes\" Molam and Dean there\nis little to say. Unlike Fletcher they have\nbeen uncontroversial and mundane; they; have\nalso been active and conscientious.\nFor too long the Royal College of Science Union\nhas at best vegetated, at worst gone to seed.\nThis year the fungus got in. Mike Scott inflicted his presence even where it was not welcome but never was anyone left with the impression that he had anything constructive to\nsay. One can but hope that the advent of\npreviously-defeated Cavanagh will bring the\ngreat wind of change RCS needs\u2014wider and\nbetter publicity, a simplified and clarified constitution and a Union Office that is the centre\nof a thriving organisation.\nIn contrast I have alwa vs admired the Strength\nof the City and Guilds College Union. D \u00bb i Howell has experienced another really encouraging year, and publicity and the \"ever-open\" Guilds Union Office in particular have\nshown how necessary the combination of a willing team and strong leader are to the continued success of what would normally be an\napathetic organisation.\nThe strength of the Royal School of Mines\nUnion, however, lies in its compactness.\nMinesmen seem extraordinarily sensitive of\ntheir small numbers w nd determined to overcome thi* apparent disadvantage. This year's success has perhaps been reflected more in\ntheir sporting achievements than in the public\npersonality of Dick Gash- Many thanks to\nGuilds an ct Mines especially for their cooperation in presenting us with news after the\ndemise of their regular columns.\nEa ch year one club stand i out from the rest.\nIn 1963/4, its formative year the HG Wells\nSociety was outstanding. The Folk Song\nClub blossomed forth in 1964/5. Much praise\nthis year is due Jim Murray and the Entertainment Committee with particular respect to\ntheir Sunday evening \"cool spots\" in the\nLower Lounge; these somehow reflect all that\nis good about IC Union. Praise too to the\nInternational Relations Club once more dealing\nwell with their original role. But. from an\nunfortunately biassed point of view, 1 feel\nthat this has been FELIX' s year.\nIts present success may be traced back to Andy\nPawlowicz in 1962/3, of whom it was later sai u he \"established something of a record in that\nhe remained in office for the whole year and\nbroke even financially.\" Regrettably the latter\ncannot be claimed for this year, but an investment of some \u00a3.200 into an organisation with\nan annual turnover of \u00a3 2 , 0 0 0 has been necessary to make possible perhaps the most expansive year in its history next year.\nThe beginning of the year bode ill, threatening\na complete reversal of the previous three\nyears' expansion through stunted advertising\nrevenue and an expected los f tv of \u00a3 1 6 0 in the\nfirst term. Only an active and united staff\ncould turn such a situation to advantage\u2014the\ninnovations of a red heading which hits comfortably but forcibly and the \"bigger look\" by\nusing a smaller type on the same size of page,\ntwo record-size editions new ideas in advertising campaigns greater interest in the College\nasi a whole rather than just the Union, and\nincreased circulation (top pir g2,000 on the\nCareers issue). .\nMy most enjoyable time on FELIX \u2014 the Spring\nTerm when we were tasting success in so many\nways. My greatest disappointment \u2014 STUDENT COLOUR, an exciting Idea which Was allowed to go to sleep. However, released of my FELIX responsibilities, I intend to kick th jt organisation into activity again, though a potential publication date must again be put)\noff for six months.\nIn February 1964 it was said, \" FELIX is rapidly\nbecoming a newspaper with enthusiasm and\nideas snowballing. We have, I think, arrived.\nBut now is not the time to sit back and rest\non our laurels. A newspaper is not static, and\nFELIX will c OTt mu ej to change.\nHaving begun his Tfa LIX career under a Combes it is particularly fitting at this time\nfor Williams to bow out to another- I wish\nPeter and next year's staff the best of luck\nand the enjoyment I have experienced in this\nyear of office.\nDI WILLIAMS U.5.1966 FELIX Imperial College Union\nPrince Consort Road\nLondon, S.W.7 Telenhones : KEN J963\nInternal 2(81/2799\nVACATION WORK?

The final aim is a per capita block grant\nwithout strings.\nNEW DIRECTOR SIR SYDNEY CAINE is due to retire as Director of the London School of Economics in September\n1967.\n* * \u2022\nSEX AT LSE COMPATIBILITY Research\nLimited, which arranges matches\nbetween the sexes by computer is po ming to LSE next term.

He has been around South\nKensington for a good deal\nlonger than that\nBom and brought up in Battersea\nis father was a jack of all trades)\ne joined the army shortly after the First WorldWar and travelled in the Middle and F \u00a3ar East, playing football for the army in HongKong and Singapore. Discharged in1926, he went to work in the Science\nMuseum in1927 came toRC Son the domestic staff in1952 and became IC Union porter in1958. he\nGeorge has often had strong views\n(and expressed them too) on various\nUnion matters. He consider^ for in stance, that the status of the College and the dignity of the Union have dropped considerably while he lias\nbeen here.\n\" These days the type of people\nyou get here just don't seem the\nsame. - They are all too ready with promises to do this and that but they're never there with the action.\" He also thinks that today's students\ndo not mix with each other or get on together as well as they used to.\nFreshers come to the College, find\nwell-established cliques of people,\nOBSERVERTHEATRE\n(good mornings begin with Gilliatt)\nEvery Sunday morning you can enjoy the razor-sharp theatre reviews of Penelope Gilliatt. She\nbrings a fresh, astringent intelligence to the\njob. You may disagree violently with what she\nsays but you wi j l relish the style with which\nshe says it. If you are tired of the jaded, predictable opinions of the establishment critics,\nbegin next Sunday morning with Gilliatt. You'll\nfind it a refreshing change.\nIn The Observer every Sunday\nare unable to get into them and mix with older people, and in general\nmake no further effort.\nGeorge is also unhappy with the\nUnion's Presidential election system.\nThe argument that a popular democratic vote is useless because first-year students will not know the\npersonalities is invalid, he says, since\nthe elections are held in the summer term, by which time everyone should have had a chance to find out about\nthe likely candidates.\nGeorge is not just destructively\ncritical however. He has. praise in particular for three of the Presidents\nhe has known \u2014 Garnet, Hill and Fletcher \u2014 for the way they have\nheld the Union down if necessary\nand their ability to make' decisions\nand get things done efficiently. Of the Icwarians he comments, \" They' re far more grateful for the things you do for them than any of the men are.\" He would like to see more girls here in future years as they\nwould undoubtedly alter the\ncharacter of the College for the better. George has become a pretty\nshrewd judge of character over his years at IC and reckons that he can assess those who are likely to get\nthrough the College successfully\nafter a couple of meetings.\nHis retirement? He fears that he will not be able to persuade his wife( who works as, a cleaner in Guilds and helps at the Saturday night hq ps) to join him in full time retire-ment so he will probably take a part-time job though leave himself\nplenty of time for his favourite past-time \u2014 gardening. Finally, George wishes, through our columns to express his thanks to all the friends\nin the G \u00b0He\nge\n> past and present, who have helped make his time here so\nthoroughly enjoyable.\nRJ C WHATS ON?\nWednesday25 C.

In their L* nd-^\nRover they will be heading out across a salt\ndesert to try to discover some mines which were\nmysteriously abandoned Some two hundred years\nago. These silver mines were responsible for a lot of the wealth of the old Spanish Empire.\nThe party is hoping to find out whether any\nof these mines have any commercial possibilities-They hope to find out the true reasons for the closure of the mines, it has been suggested that\nthis was due to uprisings amongst the slaves in the Spanish Empire. One of the places that\nthey will be visiting is a deserted town which now has one inhabitant who is the caretaker of\none of the wealthiest churches in the world. This church has gold and silver ornaments\nwhich are worth hundreds of thousands cf pounds.\nAlready plans are being made for next year's expeditions.
