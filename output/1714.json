    "content": "Smash Corner-Pok\u00e9mon Trainer - Gotta Play \u2018Em All\nDid you have trouble choosing what to wear this morning? Or deciding what to eat for lunch today? Then we got\nthe perfect Smash fighter for you, with characters #33, 34 and 35, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\nGames\nMichael Cognet\nGames writer\nI\nndeed, with him you\nwill be able to play\nSquirtle, Ivysaur\nand Charizard, and\nswitch between them at\nwill during the match.\nThese beloved characters\nare from the Pok\u00e9mon\nfranchise, appearing in the\noriginal games Red and\nBlue in 1996. They are\nall a different evolution\nof the first three starting\nPok\u00e9mons of the game:\nSquirtle is the first evolution of his line, Ivysaur\nis the second evolution of\nBulbasaur and Charizard\nis the third and final\nevolution of Charmander.\nAnd this is masterfully\nrepresented in their gameplay in Ultimate, with\neach of them having a different fighting style. This\nmakes Pok\u00e9mon Trainer a\nvery flexible and powerful\ncharacter as a whole, by\nadapting to the opponent\nor situation in order to\ntake the victory.\nTo kick it off we have\nSquirtle, a light and\nvery small fighter with\nextremely fast movement\nand close-range attacks.\nEach of his hits however\ndoesn\u2019t do a lot of damage\nso he relies on a series\nof fast chained attacks.\nSo as Squirtle, you need\nto continuously dance\naround your opponent and\navoid their hits thanks to\nyour small hitbox, and\npunish them with all your\nattacks, especially your\nparticularly fast aerials.\nTo complete his kit, he\nhas a few more tools he\ncan use with his specials.\nSquirtle\u2019s neutral is his\nWater Gun, a charged\nattack to push opponents\naway without damaging\nthem, useful to counter\ncertain recoveries. His\nside-special is Withdraw,\nwhere he will hide in his\nshell, protecting him from\nany damage, and dash to\nthe left or right, great for\nsome safe damage. And\nfinally, his up-special is his\nWaterfall, where he will\nrise diagonally, potentially taking enemies in the\nflow. This is a mediocre\nrecovering tool but can\nbe used at the end of an\naerial combo as a finisher.\nApart from that move,\nSquirtle has very few kill\nmoves due to his weak\nsmash attacks, making it\nhard for him to actually\ntake the stock. So when\nthe opponent\u2019s percentage\nis high enough, it\u2019s time\nto switch Pok\u00e9mon with\ndown-special, an ability\nall three of them share.\nThen comes Ivysaur,\nan overall medium character in weight, speed and\npower, with a great mid-range combat. He relies\non his vines to hit his\nopponent while staying at\na reasonably safe distance.\nIvysaur can harass easily\nwith his forward- and\nback-air, which have a incredible range. His smash\nattacks and grabs also\nhave an incredible reach,\nwith some sweet power\nto go with it. Ivysaur\u2019s\nspecials grants him even\nmore ranged potential,\neven allowing some\nlong-ranged pressure.\nHis neutral is his Bullet\nSeed, where he rapidly\nfires seeds directly above\nhim, to seriously damage\nany enemy coming from\nthe air. His side-special\nis his Razor Leaf, a long\nrange projectile which\nwill damage and impair\nthe opponent enabling a\npotential follow-up attack.\nAnd last but not least is\nhis up-special Vine Whip,\nboth a great finisher and\nrecovery. Indeed Ivysaur\ncan use these vines\nto whip an opponent\noverhead out of the screen\nor can use it to recover\nat a ridiculous distance\nonly if there is a ledge\nto grab on. But if you\u2019re\nhaving some trouble to\nsecure the kill or want an\neven better recovery, it\u2019s\ntime to switch to the final\nPok\u00e9mon.\nTo finish the trio, we\nhave Charizard, a very\npowerful heavy weight\nfighter but with slow\nattacks. He does however\nhave good mobility\noptions with a decent\nmove speed and a third\navailable jump. You will\nneed to take Charizard\nto end the battle with\nhis attacks and abilities\nwith ridiculous damage\nand knockback. Your\nbest tools are your fast\nback-air and side-tilt\nor slow but extremely\npowerful side-smash\nand up-smash to knock\nthem out of the park. But\nCharizard has even more\ndangerous weapons in his\narsenal with his specials.\nFirstly his neutral is his\nFlamethrower, where he\nwill breathe fire onto his\nopponent, damaging and\nimpairing them from a\nsafe distance. Then comes\nthe big guns, his side-spe-cial Flare Blitz, where\nCharizard winds-up a\nforward charge engulfed\nin flames, and explodes at\nthe contact of an enemy. A\ngreat horizontal recovery\nthat can kill at merely 60%\nbut will damage Charizard by 6% at every use.\nTo finish off, his up-spe-cial Fly is again a great\nfinisher and recovery tool.\nCharizard will spiral into\nthe sky covering decent\nvertical distances and will\nalso hit any enemy above\npotentially killing them\nat 100%. This tool is of\ncourse less powerful than\nhis side-special but much\nsafer as opponents have\nless time to react to it.\nAs you can see,\nPok\u00e9mon Trainer covers\na variety of fighting styles\nthat can theoretically be\nplayed separately, but it\nis by combining them\nthat you bring out his\ntrue potential. With three\ntimes the amount of tools\nand abilities in his kit,\nPok\u00e9mon Trainer has\nmany creative combinations to discover. But\nthe general tactic is to\nstart off with Squirtle to\nget some quick damage,\nthen to switch to Ivysaur\nto zone them in the mid-game, and finally to take\nCharizard to finish the\njob. Nonetheless, you can\nplay only one Pok\u00e9mon\nto try to counter your\nopponent\u2019s fighting style.\nFinally, a crucial trick to\nknow as Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\nis his switch dodge, which\ntakes advantage of the invincibility frames of your\ndown-special instead of a\nshield or roll to avoid your\nopponent.\nIn conclusion, if you\nmanage to combine masterfully only the strengths\nof Squirtle, Ivysaur and\nCharizard, you get a very\npowerful overall char-acter. Furthermore, with\nthree different fighting\nstyles, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\ncan be particularly hard\nto master but allows him\nto have no real counter\npick, bringing him up to a\nhigher tier. So even if you\nare not particularly inde-cisive, I highly suggest\nyou pick up Smash\u2019s\n3-for-1 special as he is not\nonly strong but also loads\nof fun.\nISSUE 1714\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nThe Pok\u00e9mon trio// Nintendo\nOur taunting turtle\nfriend// Nintendo\nThe middle child of the\nPok\u00e9mon trio// Nintendo\nPok\u00e9mon\u2019s resident\nheavyweight blitzes the\ncompetition// Nintendo\n\n"

If we\u2019re keeping it\n100, Kanye West deserves\nto win this category for\nthe immense feat of producing five albums this\nsummer.

Drake\ncomes through with a\nnew flow, fresh out of the\nOVO sweatshop. The use\nof distorted organs serves\nto give the track an eerie\nfeel and the beat change\nadds to the track\u2019s unique\nflavour. Travis Scott\nserves as the orchestrator\nbehind this track, bringing\nDrake and Swae Lee in\nwith perfect timing.\nHonourable Shoutouts\n| \u2018Mob Ties\u2019, Drake\n\u2018Mob Ties\u2019 is Drake\u2019s\nlove letter to the cruddy\nlifestyle he wishes to\nembrace. He tried it with\n\u2018Headlines\u2019 and failed\nbut, with \u2018Mob Ties\u2019, he\nhas succeeded in adding a\nlavish touch to a lifestyle\nthat few would under-stand.\nrapping ability prevents\nit from taking home the\nHOOD Grammy.\nBook of Ryan is an\nautobiographical mas-terpiece. The album is\nby no means perfect but\nRoyce makes up for the\nshortcomings by weaving\nan introspective story of\nhis life into every song.\nWith Daytona, Pusha\nT delivers a collection\nof timeless luxury raps,\nliving up to the album\u2019s\nname. It\u2019s does what\nall the other albums in\nthe 7-track G.O.O.D.\nMusic roll out failed to\ndo - making you want\nto re-up the album like\nyour local Pusha re-ups\non the pack. Production\non the album has been\ncrafted with the precision\nand brilliance we\u2019ve seen\nfrom Kanye in the past.\nHere it\u2019s displayed in a\ncontinuous uniform state\nof one sample-based\ninstrumental after the\nother. This, with Pusha\u2019s\nlyricism on the topic of the\ninner-workings and tribulations of drug dealing\nrepresent the essence of\nhip-hop, spanning from\nthe Big Daddy Kane\u2019s\nto the Jay-Z\u2019s. Despite\nits brevity, Daytona is a\nworthy winner of Album\nof the Year\nHonourable Shoutouts\n| Swimming, Mac Miller |\nNasir, Nas\nSwimming represented\nthe latest development\nin Mac Miller\u2019s musical\njourney of maturing,\nwhich we had been following with each albums.\nIt is a cruel shame that this\njourney was cut short by\nhis tragic, untimely death.\nR.I.P. Mac.\nNasir is a testament\nto Nas\u2019 longevity within\nas as Trap Michael\nJackson, would have\nswept this category with\nhis unique and almost\ndisrespectfully hard verse\non Travis Scott\u2019s \u2018CAN\u2019T\nSAY\u2019. When someone is\ngiving you a look with a\nguest spot on their album,\nyou are not meant to come\nthis hard. Especially if you\nare relativeley unknown.\nDon Toliver doesn\u2019t care.\nDrake had arguably the\nbest feature run in 2018\nand this was launched by\nhis verse on Blocboy JB\u2019s\n\u2018Look Alive\u2019 at the top of\nthe year. Drake did what\nDrake does - he floated on\nthe beat and stole the song\nfor himself, whilst simultaneously putting Blocboy\nJB on and catapulting the\nsong into the top five.\nThis has become a tried-and-tested formula almost\nas old as time itself and it\nshows no signs of failing\nany time soon.\nJ. Cole ran features in\n2018, seemingly running\na campaign to jump on\nevery rapper\u2019s tune and\nmurder every beat. This is\nunprecedented behaviour\nfrom rap\u2019s resident recluse\nbut, after a lukewarm\nreception to his K.O.D.\nalbum, this was an easy\nway for him to remain\nrelevant and keep his\nname in the conversation.\nAny number of J. Cole\nfeatures could have been\nselected for this nomination but, in the end, it went\nto his verse on J.I.D.\u2019s\nproject. J. Cole impressed\nby keeping pace with the\nrapid spitter J.I.D. and\ndropping one of the bars\nof the year -\u201cy\u2019all n****s\nhomonyms, sounding the\nsame\u201d.

However, he adds\na personal aspect to it as\nhe journeys from these\nperspectives to how it\npersonally affects him, his\nfamily and his friends. He\nthe rap game. Although\nhe has been rapping for\na considerable amount\nof time, he is still able to\ndeliver a solid project.\nThe lyrics are deep and\nmeaningful, resonating\nwith the audience as he\ndelivers his message.\nJorja Smith | Isolation,\nKali Uchis\nKali Uchis\u2019 Isolation is\na certified bop, however\nits pop-leaning sound\nmeant it was difficult to\ncategorise as R&B and\neven more difficult to\njustify as R&B Album of\nthe Year.\nJorja Smith\u2019s Lost &\nFound is another excellent\ndebut and would probably\ntake home Debut Album\nof the Year, if not for\nCardi B.\nThis category ultimately came down to 6LACK\nand The Weeknd and,\ndespite The Weeknd\u2019s\noffering only being an EP,\nthe committee had to go\nwith the lightskin sensei\nsupreme, Abel.\nMy Dear Melancholy,\nis The Weeknd in one\nof his rawest and most\nexposed forms to date.\nWe see Abel\u2019s growth, not\nonly as an artist, but as a\nperson as he transitions\nfrom making music about\npartying, drugs etc. to\nhaving an EP solely dedicated to dealing with his\nfeelings of heartbreak. It\u2019s\na bittersweet moment to\nsee ones sensei go through\nsuch feelings of turmoil,\nhowever it gives us an\nopportunity to view The\nWeeknd through a different lens, one that allows us\nto see his compassion and\nvulnerability, whilst also\ndissecting the negative\naspects of how he deals\nwith such emotion.\nHonourable Shoutouts | K.T.S.E., Teyana\nTaylor | Suncity., Khalid\n| November, SiR | Lady\nLady, Masego\nSiR\u2019s November is\nanother smooth offering\nfrom TDE\u2019s resident male\nR&B afficianado.\nIt is a real shame that\nTeyana Taylor let Kanye\nWest get his hands on her\nalbum because we suspect\nher vision for the project\nwas far greater and her\ncreativity was stifled by\nG.O.O.D.

Much like\nOle Gunnar\nSolskjaer's Manchester\nUnited, I've been lulled\ninto a false sense of security by the relatively\nsmooth running of the\nlast few issues. However, the honeymoon\nperiod is over and, with\nthis issue, I've come\ncrashing back down to\nEarth. Maybe not in as\nembarrassing fashion\nas only mustering one\nshot on target at home in\nthe Champions League,\nbut it is 8pm and I still\nhave a page and a half of\nNews and a double page\nMusic spread to finish...\nThis time last year,\nI was at a Jorja Smith\nconcert watching my\nbabes perform. Who'd\nhave thought just one\nyear later, I'd be spending\nmy Valentine's Day in a\nbasement with a bunch\nof dudes. In the immortal\nwords of Clean Bandit,\n\"there's no place I'd rather\nbe\". Anyway, perhaps it's\nthe romance in the year\nbecause I'm in a very\npoetic mood. I've taken\nthe liberty of writing a\nfew short Valentine's\npoems (this has nothing\nto do with me trying to fill\nup space right now):\nS\nhall I compare\nthee to a Summer's Day, hot\nand sweaty in the\nWest Basement.\nR\noses are red,\nviolets are\nblue, I'm stuck\nin this basement from 9 'til 2 (am).\nT\nhe breeze blows\nsoftly through\nmy fingers as I\ntype this edito-rial, thinkin 'bout you.\n2\nK\niki, do you\nlove me? Are\nyou riding?\nSay you'll\nnever ever leave from\nbeside me.\nI can't think of anymore\nsadly. Anyway, on reflection this has been an interesting week. There have\nbeen a number of developments in the News and\nthis also marks the week\nthat I finally met our President, Alice Gast (if you\ndon't count me shaking\nher hand at Graduation). I\nmust admit, I was slightly\nnervous ahead of meeting\nher, wondering if she\nreads the paper and has\nany opinions of the less\nthan glowing content we\noften include about the\nuniversity. Would she\nquiz me on the origins\nand cultural significance\nof the Felix centrefold,\nlike the Provost did last\nterm? Alas, she kind of\nran off before we had the\nchance to have a proper\nconversation. I had been\nhoping to grab her for a\nquick interview but sadly\nit was not to be. I'm sure\nour paths will cross again.\nThis week, the paper\nincludes a rundown of\nthe most hotly anticipated\nawards show of the year,\nthe 4th\nAnnual NeighbourHOOD Grammys. For\nthat reason, the Music\nsection easily snatches\nthe Section of the Week\nprize this week (a subtle\nreminder to the Arts\nSection that, in the words\nof J Hus, this competition\nis \"all about quality not\nquantity\"). Special shout-out to the Books Sectionfor once again providing\nan extremely compelling\nread - definitely skip to\nthat section if you have\na chance (after you've\nfinished taking in the\n#HOODGrammys2019 of\ncourse). Anyway, I'm out.\nHappy Valentine's Day!\n\n"

    "content": "The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name\nLoveisintheairatthisromantictimeofyearbutisitforeveryone?ThisValentine\u2019sDay,ArtswriterTesni HaddonMacmillan considers repression of different forms of love through the ages.\nARTS\nTesni HaddonMacmillan\nArts Writer\nL\nove is perhaps\nthe most integral\nand celebrated\npart of the human\ncondition. People have\nbeen known to try to express and capture it since\n800BC when the oldest\nrecorded love poem was\ncreated in Mesopotamia.\nIt is without question\nthat love is a unique\nexperience for all, and so\ncountless artists have produced their own beautiful\ninterpretations of it over\nthe years. However, not\nall love was deemed to be\nacceptable for the eyes of\nthe public, and waves of\ncensorship have plagued\nthe past.\nPerhaps the most\nobvious repression is of\nhomosexuality which was\nactually only decriminal-ised for men in the UK\n52 years ago, and even\nafter this, considered\nscandalous or taboo.\nThe daring nature of art,\nthough, meant that such\nlegislation did not deter\ngay artists from exploring\ntheir sexuality and they\ninstead adopted sophisticated code and symbolism\nto relay their desires.\nCommon symbols include\nthe peacock feather and\ngreen carnations. These\nwere worn by men to\nidentify themselves\nwithout being caught,\nand were also famously\nincluded in pieces such\nas Charles Ricketts\nand Charles Shannon\nas Medieval Saints by\nEdmund Dulac.\nAnother icon used to\nundermine censorship\nwas drag performance.\nAndy Warhol, a gay man\nhimself, was a champion\nof the queer aesthetic and\nhis bold representations\nof Marilyn Monroe as a\npop drag queen, amongt\nothers, was a true rebellion\nagainst the homophobic\nviews of America.\nYet, the censorship, and\neven fear, of homosexuality is in no way limited to\nthe 1900s; the rich history\nof queer art extends far\ninto history and into the\npresent day with surprising differences in views.\nThe Ancient Greeks\nproduced a plethora of gay\nart and had a rather unique\nview of romantic relationships to other ancient\ncultures. We could go as\nfar to say that same-sex\nattraction was revelled in,\nwith often explicit scenes\nbeing depicted in pottery\nand other art forms. Most\nnotable is the complex\nand emotional relationship between Achilles and\nPatroclus in Homer\u2019s The\nIliad.\nBy contrast, records\nof lesbian relationships\nin Greek art and, in fact,\ngenerally are very sparse.\nWe can only deduce\ntheir existence from the\nlove poetry of Sappho\nand Plato\u2019s comments\non women with \u2018female\nattachments\u2019.\nInthepresent,wewould\nconsider gay relationships\nto be commonly accepted\nbut even recently, repression has been experienced\nin the art world. In 2010,\nthe Hide/Seek: Difference\nand Desire in American\nPortraiture exhibition,\nconsidering the fluidity of\ngender and sexuality, was\ndisplayed in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait\nGallery. Its presence\nactually sparked talk of a\ncongressional review of\nthe Smithsonian\u2019s funding\nand led to the removal of\none of the pieces, Fire in\nmy Belly by David Wojnarowicz- from the exhibi-tion.Although it is evident\nthat complete freedom\nof expression is still a\nfiction, other installations\nhave aimed to represent\nsuch controversial themes\nand this includes Tate\nBritain\u2019s Queer British\nArt (1861-1967) in 2017.\nOf course, gay and\nlesbian relationships are\nnot the only supposedly\n\u2018non-traditional\u2019 relationships to have been\nconsidered distasteful.\nThe plain absence of\nblack relationships and\ninterracial relationships\nis equally shocking and\nupsetting to acknowledge.\nBlack relationships,\nregardless of orientation\nor nature, are largely\nmissing from art collec-tions. The extent of this is\ncaptured perfectly in the\n1992 painting Slow Dance\nby Kerry James Marshall,\ndubbed one of the greatest\ndepictions of lovers in\nart by the Artsy database.\nIt shows an intimate\nmoment between an African-American couple as\nthey enjoy a slow-dance\nin a living room surrounded by bright colours and\nswirling music notes.\nThe mundane tone and\nsimplicity of the scene\nstresses the normality of\nsuch images and cries out\nagainst racist attitudes. It\nhas a clear mission to encourage such representation in the mainstream and\nthis was revolutionary.\nThis act was taken\nfurther by Leslie Barlow\nto celebrate interracial\nrelationships in her mixed\nmedia series Loving,\ncreated in 2015. This\nseries is the namesake\nof the famous American\ncourt case of Loving vs\nVirginia in 1967, when\nthe Supreme Court finally\ndeemed anti-miscege-nation (anti-interracial\nrelations) laws to be\nunconstitutional. To em-phasise, it has been only\n52 years since interracial\nmarriage was legalised in\nthe United States.\nAs with Marshall,\nBarlow restricts her work\nto uneventful and commonplace scenes with the\nsimilarity that all of the\nscenes are harmonious,\nand the couples and\nfamilies are happy. And\nthis artist is not alone in\nhereffortstocorrectpublic\nopinion of race through\nart. Donna Pinckley fights\nthrough her Sticks and\nStones photo series. This\nproject is powerful in its\nsimplicity, capturing shots\nof interracial couples in\nmuted black and white.\nWith each picture is a\ncaption containing a slur\nor insult used against the\ncouple in question.\nI could go on, but I\nbelieve the point has been\nmade that love, although\ngenerally celebrated, is\nalso villainised if not\nfitting societal ideas\nof \u2018normal\u2019. Love is a\npersonal experience that\ncan be queer, interracial,\nopen or otherwise seen\nto be unconventional but\nultimately, art will find\na way to conquer taboos\nand provide an outlet for\nlovers of all types.\nIdyll (1952) // George Quaintance\nISSUE 1714\nFELIX\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSlow Dance (1992) // Kerry James Marshall\n\u201cUltimately,\nart will find\na way to\nconquer\ntaboos and\nprovide an\noutlet for\nlovers of all\ntypes\u201d\n\u201cnot all love\nwas deemed to\nbe acceptable\nfor the eyes\nof the public,\nand waves of\ncensorship\nhave plagued\nthe past \u201d\n\n"

It seems\nthat I\u2019d have to at least\nmake a start on my article\nnow, not for issues of time\nbut to capture feeling\nwhile it is still strong, for\nwhat is the point of art if\nnot to inspire feeling?\nI\u2019ve left with a sense\nof satisfaction and ex-citement. The current\ninstalment of the \u2018Pinter\nat the Pinter\u2019 series is\nengaging and cleverly\nhumorous, complete with\nan all-star cast and unique\nnarratives. Without\ngiving too much away,\nthe conclusions of both\nshort plays within this\nperformance - \u2018A Slight\nAche\u2019 and \u2018The Dumb\nWaiter\u2019 - were powerful\nand thought-provoking.\nThe performance\nbegins with \u2018A Slight\nAche\u2019, a radio play\nfocused on a respectable\ncouple, Flora (Gemma\nWhelan) and Edward\n(John Heffernan) and their\ndifferent, emotional reactions to the appearance of\na strange match-seller. As\na radio play, the stage is\nset in a recording studio,\nbut the audience is rapidly\ntransported to the home of\nEdward and Flora, their\nflowering garden and their\ndomestic lives. The play\nsits somewhere between\nthe studio and this house,\nwith Whelan and Heffernan dipping between\nbeing Edward and Flora\nand simply reciting lines\nin the studio. The studio is\na powerful tool throughout\nthe story, with props being\nactively used. The use of\nsound props- like gravel\nfor the garden path- is particularly immersive and,\nthrough contrasting tones\nand timely entrances, add\na further comic element\nto that of the characters\nthemselves.\nFlora reacts with\nkindness towards the\nmatch-seller and this is in\ncomplete contrast to the\nparanoid panic of Edward,\nwho goes as far as to invite\nhim into confrontation.\nThis fear comes with \u2018a\nslight ache\u2019 in Edward\u2019s\neyes, a recurring issue\nin the play and source of\nconstant tension.\nUpon the disturbing end\nof this first performance,\nthe stage quite literally\nswitches to a completely\nnew setting, a bare, grey\nroom. Within this place\nare two men, Gus (Martin\nFreeman) and Ben (Danny\nDyer). Through various\nhints, we eventually learn\nthat these two men are\nhired killers, waiting for\na call that their target has\narrived in the building.\nThe scenario quickly\nbecomes comical when\na dumb waiter begins\nto send down orders for\nvarious delicacies Gus\nand Ben are unsurprising-ly, unable to source. This\nplay, \u2018The Dumb Waiter\u2019,\nis in contrast to the first\nwhen it comes to dramatic\ntechnique: light and sound\nare used sparingly and\nthere is a heavy reliance\non the conversations\nbetween Gus and Ben.\nThis pays off beautifully,\ndelivering a captivating\nperformance and building\na true fondness for the\npair in a very short time.\nWhere the two plays are\nsimilar is in their dissent\ninto tension and chaos;\nas the hour grows later,\nstress boils over but still,\nthroughout, the comedy is\nupheld; honestly, hearing\nFreeman angrily shout\n\u2018scampi!\u2019 in the middle of\nan argument is a highlight\nof theatre itself.\nThe contrast between\nthe humour and dark\nthemes of \u2018Pinter 7\u2019 is\nmasterfully delivered by\ntalented actors and a real\nhit with audiences. The\ntheatre echoed with the\ngasps of awed patrons\nas the curtain fell and\nthat itself should speak\nvolumes of the skill of\nboth Jamie Lloyd\u2019s direction of the shows and,\nof course, Harold Pinter\nhimself.\nFolk tales of an anti-facist working-class hero\nW\nhilst living\nin Scotland\nI learnt that\nthere are\nfew better ways to spend\na cold Tuesday night than\nin one of the many folk\nbars dotted throughout the\ncountry. Here, in the warm\natmosphere of ale and\nbrown wood, musicians\nwalk in and out, playing\nfreely, supping from their\npints, waxing lyrics and\ngiving life to tales both old\nand new. Last Saturday\nnight, I couldn\u2019t help but\nreminisce these jovial\nnights as the Young\u2019uns\npresented, sang, and\nrecalled The Ballad of\nJohnny Longstaff. This is\na tale in the most honest\nmeaning of the word, one\nof oral tradition, the kind\npassed from generation\nto generation, kept as an\nheirloom to be repeated\nin pubs across the land.\nTeeside Folk extraordi-naires the Young\u2019uns keep\ntrue to this tradition, despite the formality of the\nSouthbank Centre stage.\nUsing little more than\ntheir voices, interview\nfragments, and the occasional instrument, they\ngive life to the show\u2019s\nstar: Johnny Longstaff.\nLongstaff\u2019s story,\nwhich the Young\u2019uns\nthemselves heard from\nLongstaff\u2019s son at a show,\nis one that deserves to\nstand the test of time\nand be recollected again\nand again. A young man\nwalking from Stockon-onTees to London in desperation of something to eat\nand somewhere to work,\nLongstaff soon found\nhimself in the middle of\nthe unionised workers of\nthe time. This is becomes\nthe background for the\nshow\u2019s central focus,\nthat of Longstaff fighting\nagainst Franco during the\ncivil war between the republicans and nationalists\nof Spain. It is a show that\nis remarkable in many\nways. The first being\nthe sheer variety of enthralling British interwar\nhistory that is recollected,\nall with Longstaff at the\ncentre.\nUpon your return home\nfrom the show you\u2019ll find\nyourself on your laptop\nlooking up the Battle of\nCable Street, Oswald\nMosley, Hunger marches\nand \u201cHow can I learn to\nsing like the Young\u2019uns?\u201d.\nFor here, recollection is\nnot just spoken word, but\nalso ballads, chants and a\nhilarious ditty or two. The\ntalent of the singing trio\nthat form the Young\u2019uns\ncan\u2019t be understated.\nWhether it be acappella\nor with musical backing,\ntheir stunningly crisp\nvoices echo and give\nwarmth to Longstaff\u2019s\nstory. In between songs or\nnarration, the stage centre\nlights up for Longstaff to\ngive fragmental accounts\nof his past. These, along\nwith the occasional projected photo, help ground\nthesinginginrealitywhich\nironically leaves one in a\nfurther state of disbelief as\nthe story unfolds. Moving\nmoments are plenty here,\nso tissues for tears (both\nof joy and sadness) will\nbe needed. Longstaff, his\nfriends, and the estimated\nthirty thousand volunteers who fought against\nfascism in the International Brigades need their\nstory to be spoken \u2013 here\nthe Young\u2019uns have truly\ndone it justice.

There\u2019s more to travel than just century old monuments!\nTravel\nMarco Rodrigues\nTravel Writer\nI\nfound myself in the\nin the middle of an\nAIESEC reunion,\nright in the heart\nof Alger, when this tall\nAlgerian man approaches\nme in Portuguese. I was\nnot expecting that at all,\nas the spoken language\nat this meeting was either\nEnglish, French or Arabic.\nA week had passed since\nI left Portugal to do volunteering in Algeria for\none and a half months,\nand I must say, I really\nfelt nostalgic when I\nheard a random \u201cOl\u00e1\u201d and\n\u201cObrigado\u201d. It was the\nperfect way to break the\nice, we started chatting\nand this man shared about\nhis time in Portugal (with\nAIESEC as well) and\nabout his visits to Lisboa,\nPorto and Sesimbra.\nHis name was Rabah,\nhe gave me his contact\nand proposed a trip to the\nKabylie area - at the time\nI was in the Arabic region\nof Algeria.\nSome weeks had passed\nand I had not seen Rabah\nin a while, my volunteer\nexperience was coming to\nan end soon, so I figured I\nshould either join another\nproject or perhaps travel.\nWhile thinking about my\nfuture weeks in Algeria,\nRabah came to mind\nand I texted him. For my\nsurprise he kindly replied\nsaying that he was going\nto Tizi Ouzo \u2013 a Kabylie\narea in the middle of the\nmountains - and proposed\nonce again for me to join.\nI gladly accepted his\ninvitation and not even a\nweek after finishing my\nvolunteer work, I was on\nmy way to Kabylie.\nRabah and a friend\npicked me up in a\ntwo-seat van, so I took\nthis journey in the back of\nthe van, with no windows.\nLuckily, the van had a\nside door I could open, so\nmy five-hour journey was\nspent legs hanging outside\nthe van just contemplating\nthe view on my way to the\nmountains.\nWhen we reached the\nKabylie region, all women\nwore colourful and flowy\nbeautiful dresses. Rabah\ntells me that his village\nand the others nearby, are\nlocated in a zone called\nPortugal. Being told such\na coincidence while I was\ntaking in all the magic of\nthis place, I felt stuck in a\nmoment of immense joy.\nRabah introduced me to\nhis cousins and then more\n\u201cIt seemed\nto me as an\nexperience I\ncouldn\u2019t say no\nto\u201d\ncousins and even more\ncousins after that, and\nthen we finally headed to\nhis house. It was a house\nwith no electricity and\nno water, with a fountain\njust half a mile away. It\nwas summer, so none of\nit mattered. That night we\nwent to see some friends\nthat turned out to be great\nmusicians; they also lived\nin the mountains and\nthey even had their own\ntobacco farm. We spent\na really pleasant night\ndrinking wine, smoking\nhomemade shisha and\nlistening to great music\n(even bossa-nova), all\nwhile under a sky full\nof stars so clear it felt\nunreal - not easy to find\nnowadays.\nAnother night had\npassed and I moved back\nto Alger, spent some\ndays exploring there and\nmoved to Bejaia, also in\nthe Kabylie area, for a\nweek. Bejaia is a port city\nby the mediterranean sea.\nI spent four incredible\ndays there, mastering the\nart of preparing shisha, so\nmuch so that by the end of\nit, I couldn\u00b4t even stand\nthe smell of it anymore.\nAt this point, Rabah\ncalled me for one last\ntrip to the Kabylie moun-tains, a weeding he said.\nIt seemed to me as an\nexperience that I couldn\u00b4t\nsay no to. I found myself\nagain in Portugal away\nfrom Portugal (meaning\nthat Kabylie area), where\nthe people dress with\ncolourful, flowy, dancing\nclothes. On this day there\nseemed to be more people\nthan before, an explosion\nof colour. We were near\nthis shop where I bought\nsome \u201cCheema\u201d, which is\npure tobacco powder that\nyou put right in your gums\nand wait until you feel\nthis hit of nicotine rushing\nthrough you.\nRabah had left to greet\nsome of his cousins, so\nI found a quiet staircase\nnear the shop and tried\nsome more \u201cCheema\u201d.\nMore and more of these\ncolourful dressed woman\nseemed to keep gathering,\nand the more they appear,\nthe more I felt the nicotine\nrushing. The colours, the\nsmells, the nicotine and\nadrenaline rush, it all\nseemed like one beautiful\nPollock\u2019s paint right in\nfront of me.\nLess than 10 minutes\nhad passed, Rabah returns\nand we go for the greatest\ncouscous meal I\u2019ve ever\nhad \u2013 I have been trying\nto copy this same kind of\ncouscous but I am light\nyears away of achieving\nit! During the meal, I had\nthe opportunity to meet\nmore of Rabah\u2019s cousins,\ncommunicating using my\nvery limited French and\nimprovised sign language.\nIt is impressive how much\nwe can learn from others\neven when we don\u2019t speak\nthe same language!\nAt night time, after the\nwedding, there was this\nbig dance competition.\nThe woman, dressed with\ncolourful yet barely-there\nclothing, were now\nsinging and dancing in a\nvery seductive way, while\nthe man were sitting,\nchatting and very much\nenjoying each perfor-mance.\nWhile I was as well,\nRabah invited me for\nsome \u201cHaraam\u201d (which\nis the Arabic word for\nbreaking the Islamic\nrules). Cousins and drinks\nappeared out of nowhere,\nand we drank in a hidden\nplace while hearing the\nwomen singing and\nclapping their hands. I\ndon\u2019t actually remember\nwhat happened after that,\nbut Rabad tells me I spoke\nabout mathematics with\na cousin that could only\nspeak Arabic and Kabyle.\nSomehow we understood\neach other at that time and\nthis was definitely one\nof the best experiences I\nhave ever had!\nThe following day I\nmoved back to Alger, two\ndays after that I moved\nback to Portugal (this time\nmy country), and now,\nalmost four years later, I\ncan still feel the intensity\nof those magical, soul-fill-ing, colourful mountains\npainted by women, by\nsimplicity and a few drops\nof Kabylie madness.\nDo you have great\nstories you would like to\nshare about your experience volunteering, taking\na placement or while on\nErasmus abroad?

Here,\na distorted saxophone\nprovides the backbone\nfor a compelling and unsettling track that stands\nout in the list, providing\nparanoia and unease that\ncontrasts well with the\nsincere and honest tone of\nthe previous songs.\nFollowing this intensity is another moment\nof quiet, \u2018A Boat To An\nIsland Pt. 2 / Agatha\u2019s\nSong\u2019, which is the only\ntrack that the album could\nhave done without. The\nambient drone is pretty,\nbut at just shy of 5 minutes\nit overstays its welcome,\nwith a barely existent\nstructure that makes the\nsong vague and nebulous.\nThe final song, \u2018Murmurations\u2019, mirrors the\nfirst track by creating\nextreme beauty through\ndissonance, but this\ntime the effect is even\nmore powerful. The\nverses are incredibly odd\nand unsettling, with an\nevil-sounding drone and\nunsure, nervous singing.\nThe verses evoke intense\nfeelings of unease,\nand, like \u2018Nice Libres\u2019,\nthe choruses provide\na contrast so gorgeous\nthey feel transcendent,\nredemptive. Each chorus\nis short-lived, plunging\nthe listener back into\ndarkness, before a final\nchorus brings you to\nthe surface for good,\nwith extra layers of lush\ninstrumentation and\ndrums. Again, charming\nlyrics display Ben\u2019s appreciation for plainness\nand simplicity, sung in a\ntriumphant and jubilant\ntone. \u201cMissed the end of\nthe world / And that was\njust fine / Saw my family\nfor the holidays / And\nwe had a good time\u201d is\nbeautiful in its directness\nand understatement, and\n(again) the sincerity with\nwhich they are sung.\nThis album is poetic,\nrestrained, gorgeous, and\nmoving. It is incredibly\nadmirable that, instead of\nfollowing the hit-making,\nplatinum-selling formula\napparent on Every\nKingdom for producing\nradio-friendly ballads,\nBen has developed a\nsound that reflects artistry\nand honesty, a sound\nwhich is more difficult,\nless direct, but strikes\nthose who persevere with\nits unique, subtle beauty.\nIs that Kevin Parker in the background? // Wikimedia\nNoonday Dream revisited: How one gig opened my\nReleased back in June 2018, Ben Howard\u2019s Noonday\nDream was drastically unlike any of his previous works,\ndividing fans and critics alike. Initially panned by many\n(music writer Alex Large included) for its sombre and\ndesolate tones , the album is a slow burner that has to\nbe experienced live to be fully appreciated.\n\u201cPowerful\nlyrics which\nare at times\nabstract and\npoetic, at times\ndirect and\nprofound, but\nalways sung\nwith charming\nrestraint\u201d\nB\nen Howard has\nhad an interesting change in\nsound throughout his releases. His debut,\nEvery Kingdom, was full\nof uplifting indie-folk\nsongs with sing-along\nchoruses and a (generally)\ncarefree tone. His next\nrelease, The Burgh Island\nEP, marked a change in\nmood hinted at by the\ncover art; these songs\nwere darker, but the shift\nfrom naivet\u00e9 to moodiness made the music more\ncompelling; optimistic\nmelodies and lyrics were\nreplaced with moments\nof soul-bearing emotional\npotency which were far\nmore exciting in their\nhonesty and vulnerability.\nHis sophomore album,\nI Forget Where We Were,\ncontinued to eschew the\nlight-hearted ballads that\nbrought him fame, and\nagain featured album art\nto broadcast this intention.\nThe majority of the songs\nwere dark and complex,\nyet kept accessible by\nclear and well-crafted\nsong structures and Ben\u2019s\npassionate, emotional\ndelivery.\nIt was evident, there-fore, that Ben had disavowed the upbeat tone\nof Every Kingdom that\nhad brought him fame,\nand his biggest hits. The\nfirst trajectory of Ben\u2019s\nsound was from youthful\ninnocence to a more\nmature, sombre tone, and\nNoonday Dream demonstrates a second shift:\nfrom extreme approacha-bility, to a heavier sound\nmade compelling by raw\ndisplays of emotion, and\nfinally to a style that is far\nmore reserved, less attention grabbing, and more\ndifficult to appreciate on a\nfirst listen.\nand desolate music that\nwas still transparently\nemotive and direct, with\nclear melodies and song\nstructures that could be\nparsed without requiring\nmuch focused attention.\nI shelved the album,\nthinking he had lost his\npassionate spark and gone\noddly tame.\nHowever, after\nattending a live show\nthis January, the music\nclicked. These live performances were just as subtle\nand understated as their\nalbum counterparts, but\nthe act of being present\nin the same room as the\nperformer and his band,\nwith full attention paid\nto the music, made their\noblique beauty come to\nlife. And the fact that Ben\nchose to play these songs\nalmost exclusively struck\nme as brave, considering\nthe marked difference in\ntone between them and\nthe songs most of the\ncrowd no doubt wished\nto hear. It was admirable\nthat Ben stuck to his guns\nand didn\u2019t play a single\nsing-along hit that he must\nnow see as childish, and\ndemonstrates great faith\nin the new material.\nWith a newfound appreciation for both the music\nand Ben\u2019s artistry, I revisited the album, and found\na veritable treasure trove\nof beauty. The simple,\ncatchy choruses of Every\nKingdom are gone, and so\ntoo are the dark, tormented screams of passion\nthat provided many of\nthe most potent moments\nfrom his previous album.\nIn their place are powerful\nlyrics which are at times\nabstract and poetic, at\ntimes direct and profound,\nbut always sung with\ncharming restraint. The\ninstrumentals are softer,\ndenser and more interesting than previous albums,\nwith less reliance placed\non a finger-picked guitar,\nand still contain moments\nof intensity that lend the\nalbum a good sense of\npacing and variety.\nThe primary theme\nof this Noonday Dream,\nevidenced both in the\nnewly restrained sound\nand Ben\u2019s lyrics, is an\nappreciation for the little\nthings, for a quiet, modest\nlife, more reminiscent of\na well-travelled poet than\na celebrity. The album art\nand promotional music\nvideo mirror this inten-tion; on the cover, Ben\nblends in with his sur-roundings, barely visible,\nless an attention-seeking\nperformer than a piece of\nthe environment. In the\nmusic video for \u2018Nica\nLibres At Dusk\u2019, Ben\nis present, but his face\nis never visible. This\nrejection of fame was also\napparent during the live\nshow, where the spotlight\nwas trained on Ben from\nbehind, transforming him\ninto an elusive silhouette.\nA number of lyrics\nreflect Ben\u2019s newfound\ninterest in simplicity and\npeace, enjoyment of the\npresent, and an appreciation of nature. Like\nmany profound things,\nthese lyrics can seem\nsimplistic and banal when\nread or stated plainly, but\npaired with the evocative\nmusic and Ben\u2019s sincere\ndelivery, they often strike\nyou as both aspirational\nand inspiring. From the\nopening track, \u2018Nica\nLibres at Dusk\u2019, the lyrics\n\u201cNow I am older / I don\u2019t\nlook over my shoulder\n/ I know what is there in\nfront of me\u201d provide the\nemotional climax of the\nsong, and demonstrate\nBen\u2019s newfound maturity\nand contentment with\nliving in the present.\nThis opening track is\nfantastic because of the\nlyrics, but also because of\nthe intense sonic disparity\nbetween verse and chorus.\nAs the album opener, the\nverses are surprisingly\nunsettling, with an unrelenting guitar loop that\nrefuses to shift, and the\nfirst line \u201cDoor is locked\n/ My gums are bleeding\u201d,\ncombining to create a dis-orientating, uneasy mood.\nHowever, this uncomfortable sound transforms\nwith the chorus, becoming\nblissful and euphoric,\nand the preceding unease\ncontributes greatly to\nthe newfound feeling of\nsalvation and safety.\nAfter this comes\n\u2018Towing the Line\u2019, a quiet\nand understated song consisting primarily of Ben\u2019s\nvocals, a muted guitar, and\nsubtle vocoder backing\nvocals. This track, which\nis somehow both delicate\nDay after day, alone on a hill... // Island\nMUSIC\nAlex Large\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Ben Howard. Label:\nIsland.

The glory days of\nvoluntourism are slowly\ncoming to an end. The\nreality that it does more\nharm than good in the long\nterm is slowly dawning on\npeople. Before we contin-ue, let me make it clear\nthat voluntourism is not\nthe same as volunteering.\nVoluntourism is the volunteering done while on\nvacation and it is usually\na non-recurring event in\nsomeone\u2019s life. It is usually a one-time experience\nthat you can use to beef\nup your resume or to feel\nbetter about yourself.\nIf you are planning to\nspend a week in Africa\nto aid poverty-stricken\norphans, you should\nprobably reevaluate what\nyou are doing to help. In\ntheory, giving children\nmoral support, passing out\nfood and teaching English\nsounds like the perfect\nway to help. However,\nthis couldn\u2019t be further\nfrom the truth. The people\nwhose volunteer work\ncan be classified into\nvoluntourism are usually\npeople lacking expertise\nin the skills required.\nThey therefore spend a\nweek learning a new skill\ninstead of being produc-tive. This vicious cycle\nkeeps repeating as, by\nthe time people pick up a\nskill that might be useful,\nthey return home. Despite\nthis fact, most volunteers\nleave with a completely\nnew mindset \u2013 that they\nmust rescue people from\nthe suffering they have\nwitnessed. It\u2019s a noble\nthought, but this trend of\nvoluntourism shows that\npeople don\u2019t really learn\nabout the country they\nwent to, or what causes\nthe suffering they saw.\nThis leads to two major\nissues, with one feeding\ninto the other.\nFirstly, we must tackle\nthe mindset of the \u2018benevolent West\u2019 having to\n\u2018rescue the poor\u2019. This\nthought process leads\nto Western intervention\nin countries where volunteers may be needed.\nFor example, pictures\nof starving African\nchildren are being used\nin campaigns to draw\npeople in, but this only\nconvinces people that the\npoverty there can\u2019t be\nsolved without Western\nintervention. The situation\nisn\u2019t helped by the general\nlack of knowledge about\nthese countries. This feeds\nthe second major issue:\nthat the root problems of\nsuffering countries are not\naddressed, as most people\nare not even aware of what\nthey are. Volunteers are so\ncaught up in what they\nsee that they don\u2019t stop to\nthink about what the underlying issues could be.\nAs these volunteers only\nsee the suffering, their\nmisconceptions remain\nand nothing is done to\naddress the fundamental\nissues.\nThis raises the question:\nis voluntourism doomed?\nNo, it isn\u2019t. I do not raise\nthe issue of voluntourism\nso that people shy away\nfrom short volunteering\ntrips, but instead to inform\nthem on how to make their\ntime worthwhile. This can\nbe done by understanding\nthat volunteering trips\naren\u2019t about helping the\npoor, but rather learning\nmore about the crisis the\ncountry is in, understanding what its people are\ngoing through, building\nrelations, and finding out\nmore about the country\u2019s\nculture. Having a better\nunderstanding between\ndifferent cultures can\nhelp bridge the gaps we\nare faced with, as once\nwe stop looking at these\ncountries as charity cases\nwe can begin to find a way\nto help build them up.\n\n"

This time, it\nreturns to the prestigious Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith.\nWhat is The Bhangra\nand exciting TBS to date.\nWe have one of the best\nteams this year and are\nsuper excited to bring\nTBS back home to the\nApollo\u201d\nAnisha Malli, a 2nd\nyear medical student, also\nfrom the committee, said,\n\u201cDespite how stressful\nrunning a show of this\nsize has been for its main\norganisers, it is definitely\nworth it because TBS is\namazing to watch and\nwe get to raise money for\nsome incredible charities.\nWhat drew me to PSoc\nwas its inclusivity and\nhow the whole society felt\nlike an extension of my\nfamily. I\u2019d never been part\nof anything related to my\nculture whilst at school\nso it was exciting to learn\nmore about being Punjab\nat university.\u201d\nWhilst The Bhangra\nShowdown is now world\nrenowned, these Imperial\nstudents over the last\ndecade have worked to\nmake it a success story.\nThis was considered\nunexpected in the words\nJessica Gar-Lai Cheung leads Team Loughborough //\nPunjab2000\nof Hardeep Dhanjal,\nfounder of The Bhangra\nShowdown \u2013 an imperial\nstudent back in 2007!\n\u201cIt started as an idea\nbetween good friends,\nwith a view to replicating the successes of\nwell-known shows in the\nUS and Canada, which\nwere gaining traction on\nYouTube at the time.\nWe were fortunate that\nthe Millennium Dome\nhad just been purchased\nby O2 and so an amazing\nvenue was available for a\nShinda and The PropheC.\nExpect to hear the famous\n\u2018Mundian Toh Bach Ke\u2019,\nwhich is the synonymous\nBhangra song you hear at\nevery night out!\nUniversity teams competing include Aston University, Brunel University,\nHertfordshire University,\nImperial College London,\nKings College London,\nLeicester University,\nLoughborough University, St. George\u2019s and Royal\nHolloway University. All\nof the teams will be co-ed,\nwhich usually consists\nof eight male and eight\nfemale dancers.\nWho organises The\nrelatively good price and\nwe managed to convince\nthe student union that\nBhangra would be the\nnext best thing after Britain\u2019s Got Talent!\nUnfortunately, up until\nthe night before the show,\nwe had only confirmed\n250 tickets, leaving most\nof us disappointed.\nHowever, we were\nthen pleasantly surprised\nto hear that the phone\nhadn\u2019t stopped ringing\nall morning on the final\nday, pushing our debut\nShowdown?\nT\nhe Bhangra\nShowdown has\nbeen organised\nby Imperial\nCollege Punjabi Society\nsince 2007. Various\nuniversities across the\ncountry, with students\nfrom different courses and\nyears, train for months\nto compete in front of an\naudience of 3000.\nPreviously, it has taken\nplace in both Birmingham\nand in London, in venues\nsuch as Wembley Arena,\nNIA Birmingham and\nResorts World Arena.\nThe high production\nstage set up, quality of\nteams and high profile\nPunjabi artists are reasons\nwhy students, families\nand Bhangra lovers look\nforward to this competition every year. Moreover,\nthe funds for this event go\ntowards charitable causes.\nFollowing the compe-tition, some of the teams\u2019\nYoutube videos have\ncrossed over 100,000\nviews, making it a globally\nfollowed competition.\nAnisha Malli said,\n\u201cTBSisthebiggeststudent\nrun show in the UK, so\nits size alone does give\nit a different atmosphere\nto other Imperial shows.\nAlso, it is entertainment\nnot just for students, but\nalso for families. The\nshow attracts people from\nso many different backgrounds and is enjoyable\nfor all.\u201d\nWhat can we expect\nfrom this year\u2019s com-petition?\nNothing less than a\nnight of entertainment\nshould be expected. This\nincludes a star studded\nline up of Punjabi artists\nand the most elite university Bhangra teams\ncompeting.\nBhangra is a colourful\nand vibrant dance form\noriginating from the\nIndian subcontinent. Over\nthe last few decades, it has\nattracted undeniable popularity worldwide with its\nhigh energy performanc-es, fluid movement and\nformations, and music\nthat will want to make you\ndance!\nArtists include high\nprofile names in Bhangra\nmusic, such as Punjabi\nMC, Raxstar, Surinder\nnumbers to 1000!This was\nthe beginning of Bhangra\nin the modern era for the\nUK and the competition\nspace has now expanded\nsignificantly beyond our\nwildest imagination.\u201d\nThe Imperial Team\nImperial College also\nhas its own Bhangra team,\nwhich has competed\nevery year at The Bhangra\nShowdown. It has generally been quite successful\n\u2013 winning the competition\nthree times and placing in\nmost. However, one of the\nmost special things about\nthe Imperial team is how\ninclusive the team is to\nnew dancers and giving\nthem this opportunity.\nDancers from the team tell\nus more:\nMaya Satheeskaran, a\n1st\nyear medical student\nfrom Southside hall said,\n\u201cone of my mates took me\nto a free bhangra session.\nEven though I was bad at\nit, I went to more sessions\nas I really enjoyed it and\ngoing to more helped me\nimprove. Then, luckily, I\nwas selected when auditions came around.\nI think it\u2019s nice for the\nteam to change every year\nso that new people can\nmeet each other. I look up\nat the older dancers as I\u2019m\nstarting up on the bhangra\njourney, but I hope that I\ncontinue it in future years\npotentially.\u201d\nAnnanya Menon, a 3rd\nyear medical student said,\n\u201cPreviously it has taken place in both Birmingham and in London, in venues such as Wembey Arena, NIA Birmingham and Resorts Wrold Arena\u201d //Punjab2000\nBhangra Showdown?\nOur very own Imperial\nPunjabi society, a small\ncommittee of less than\na dozen, organises this\ncompetition year on year.\nAman Ghataura, a 4th\nyear Physics student, from\nthe committee, said: \u201cThe\nPunjabi Society has been\nworking round the clock\nto bring the most modern \u201cThe next best thing after Britain\u2019s Got Talent!\u201d // Punjab2000\n\u201cover the years I have\ncome to appreciate the\ndifferent styles of dance,\neven the difference in\ntechnique within a dance\nform. Bhangra has been\nmore about technique and\nfitness.\nHaving danced a lot\nat university, Bhangra\nwas a different dance\nform I wanted to try to\npush myself. It is a very\ndifferent process and\nexperience and provides a\nphysical challenge. I have\nenjoyed picking up new\ntechnique over the last\nfew weeks and bettering\nmy skills as a dancer with\nthe use of various props\nas well as enjoying the\nvariation in dance style\nwithin Bhangra.\u201d\n\u201cWhat drew me to PSoc was its inclusivity\u201d // Punjab2000\nMany of the dancers\nhave done multiple\nshows during their time\nat Imperial. For example,\nMaya is also currently\nchoreographing for East\nMeets West and Annanya\nwas captain of Imperial\u2019s\nwinning Just Bollywood\nteam. However, it is clear\nthat, for these dancers,\nthere is something\nunique about TBS that\nmakes months of difficult\ntraining so worthwhile.\nLakshi Selva, a 5th\nyear medical student and\ncaptain of the team this\nyear said, \u201cBhangra has\ntaught me a lot about time\nmanagement and being\nefficient. Bhangra makes\na good break from 5th\nyear medicine which can\notherwise be quite monotonous and repetitive. The\nchallenge of The Bhangra\nShowdown keeps me\non my feet and gives me\nsomething new to look\nforward to everyday.\u201d\nThe Cause\ncommunities and improving their long term\nprospects.\nHow can I get tickets?\nThe 12th\nedition of The\nBhangra Showdown is set\nto be an exciting one that\nyou should not miss on 2nd\nMarch 2019.\nTickets for the competition are selling out fast\nand can be purchased\nfrom the Eventim Apollo\nwebsite (https://evntm.uk/\nbhangra19fb).

    "content": "ISSUE 1714\nFELIX\n6\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nUnion Reform has only just begun \u2013 now we\nneed you\nThis week comment writer Ansh Bhatnagar argues for your support for far reaching and\nenduring Union reform\nCOMMENT\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nComment Writer\nA\nfter a hefty\ndebate about\nmy paper, with\nmany a discussion being had about if we\nneed Union reform, when\nwe need Union reform,\nwhy we need Union\nreform, and how we\nshould do Union reform,\nthe paper was passed,\nwith an amendment limiting the scope of reform to\ndemocratic engagement;\ncurrently done through\nUnion Council and its\nsubcommittees.\nIf you missed my\narticle last week, here is\na quick summary why I\nwant to shake things up\nat the Union. I believe\nthat the Union is currently\nnot doing a great job of\ninvolving students in the\ndecision making process.\nThe procedure for the\npassing of motions for\nthe improvement of the\nstudent experience is often\nbureaucratic, new changes\nhave to go through long\nperiods of exhaustive\nand exhausting review\nbefore being implemented\n(often lasting as long as\nor even longer than than\na year or two!) and are\nincredibly inaccessible for\nthe average student. This\nmight mean that a change\nyou set in motion could\nonly be enacted after\nyou graduate. As a new\nCouncil Rep last year,\nI faced a steep learning\ncurve that barred me from\ngetting more involved and\nthis is an issue faced by\nCouncil Reps every year,\nas well as people on CSP\ncommittees, Management\nGroups, etc.\nUnion Council is the\ncentral democratic body\nof the Union. It\u2019s where, in\ntheory, the work of Officer\nTrustees (the elected\nPresident + Deputy Presidents) is scrutinised, and\nwhere senior volunteers\npass policy for the Union.\nHowever, over the last\nfew years it has become\nincreasingly clear that it\nhasn\u2019t been successful in\nacting upon these princi-ples, with some volunteers\nfeeling that it\u2019s one great\nbig formality and that very\nlittle is actually achieved.\nI don\u2019t believe this is to do\nwith the people elected on\nto Council; the people on\nCouncil are some of the\nhard-working and committed volunteers I know,\nand if they weren\u2019t, you\u2019d\nexpect the effectiveness to\nfluctuate over the years.\nThe fact that it hasn\u2019t been\neffective despite having\neffective individuals\nsitting on it suggests that\nthe way Council is structured is the source of the\nproblem \u2013 the structure\nof the Union\u2019s current\ndemocratic processes do\nnot allow for our students\nto flourish and really lead\nthe Union.\nLast week I put out a\ncall in my article calling\non students to come to\nCouncil to show support\nfor my paper. I was\nmessaged by people who\nsaid they were surprised\nthat they could just show\nup to these meetings.\nDespite the Union trying\nto communicate this year\nthat anyone can come to\nCouncil and propose a\npolicy paper, non-voting\nmember attendance has\ncontinued to be virtually\nnon-existent. These are\nthe main reasons why I\nthink we need a better\ndemocratic structure that\nallows for grassroots\nparticipation and for our\nstudents to lead the way\nin how the Union is run.\nAfter I argued strongly for\nchange, Union Council\nwhere it fails, what other\nstudent Unions do better,\nand most importantly:\nhow we can improve our\nown Union. Whether it\nbe a modified version of\nCouncil or something\ncompletely different, by\nthe end of it we will come\nup with a proposal that the\nmajority of the working\ngroup will agree on, and\nsubmit to Council for\nit to be approved. Who\nknows, it might be the last\nthing Council passes in its\ncurrent form!\nAny major changes to\nthe Union require a 2/3rd\nmajority vote at Council.\nThis is incredibly hard\nto win, especially when\nproposing something this\nhuge. This is why we\nneed to make sure that the\nproposal has backing from\nall kinds of students \u2013 such\nas academic and wellbeing reps, clubs and societies committee members,\nmanagement group vol-unteers, council members,\nOfficer Trustees, and even\nstudents who don\u2019t hold an\nelected role. The changes\nwill affect the way that\neveryone participates with\nthe Union, so we need lots\nof students to get involved\nand make sure that we\nget it right \u2013 after all, you\nknow better than we do\nhow you interact with the\nUnion!\nSo come along to the\ndiscussions when you\nwant, contribute what you\ncan, and get involved with\na project that will make the\nUnion work better for you\nin 2020 and beyond! Sign\nup for the working group\nat bit.ly/ICUReform, and\ncontact me at ab4616@\nic.ac.uk if you have any\nquestions or ideas for the\nUnion!\nBeit has literally never looked this nice // Imperial Asset Library\nagreed and has approved a\nprocess for reform.\nMany senior volunteers\nwere concerned that\nthis reform would lead\nnowhere, especially with\nthe spectre of third term\nlooming on the horizon.\nWould it even be possible\nto get the new structure\npassed in time? This is\nwhere you step in; the procedure to achieve a more\ntransparent, member-led, and accessible\nUnion needs students\nfrom all parts of campus\n(and other campuses!) to\njoin in a \u201cworking group\u201d.\nThis group would meet\nregularly and discuss\nwhereourUnionsucceeds,\n\n"

    "content": "Cougar at the Orange Tree Theatre\nT\nhe title of Rose\nL e w e n s t e i n \u2019s\nplay is not vague\nin any way \u2013 it\ntriggers a very obvious\nassociation with the\nimage of an older woman,\npresumably in her forties,\nseducing a younger man\ninto an illicit sexual rela-tionship. Leila, (Charlotte\nRandle), is a superficially\npowerful woman leading\nthe way for corporate\nsustainability in the wake\nof climate change. She\nbecomes lovers with a\nyoung bartender in his\ntwenties, John (Mike\nNoble), and pays to bring\nhim along on her travels\nacross the globe as she\nlectures corporate giants\non the profitability of the\n\u201cGreen Agenda\u201d. Their\ntime is limited to hotel\nrooms that blur together\nas the play progresses,\nbecoming indistinguishable from one another,\nas do the cities they hop\nbetween.\nIt becomes clear that\nJohn is essentially a\nvery expensive piece\nof luggage that Leila is\nlugging from country to\ncountry, and, though he\nbegins to fall for her, she\nseems emotionally impen-etrable. He is just a sexual\nobject to her, refusing the\nintimacy he desires. The\nchaos within their relationship is mirrored both\nin the chaos of the outside\nworld and the physical\nchaos of the set, which\nis slowly demolished\nthroughout the play.\nfrenzied non-linear snapshots of John and Leila\u2019s\naffair, and how it comes\nto fall apart. The dialogue\nflicks back and forth in\ntime to repeat previous\nsentiments and lines, and\nthe effect is enhanced by\nthe use of lighting and\nmovement. My closing\npiece of advice would\nbe not to be put off by\nthe mediocre reviews\nthis play is receiving (a\nsurprise to me personally).\nIt\u2019s a visually stimulating\nwatch, with interesting\npower play between the\ntwo characters. At its\nheart, this is a play about\nconsumption, in all the\ndifferent senses of the\nword. As writer Rose\nLewenstein powerfully\nputs it in a podcast with\nOrange Tree Theatre:\n\u201cThey are consuming the\nworld, we are consuming\nthe world, they are consuming each other, and\nthe play is consuming\nthem\u201d.\nThe Great Gatsby: An Immersive Experience\nN\not to brag, but\nI was seated\npersonally by\nJay Gatsby\nhimself.\nThe Great Gatsby is a\ntragedy written by F. Scott\nFitzgerald set in 1920s\nAmerica where the wealthy\nsquander their money,\nbehaving recklessly, loving\nfoolishly. The story centres\naround love triangles\nbetween a mysterious Jay\nGatsby and a married (to a\ncheating Tom Buchanan)\nDaisy Buchanan. They throw\ngrand parties as facades to\ntheir unhappy lives, only to\nend in murder and suicide.\nThough immersive theatre\nis always very interactive,\nthe success of this show\nexceeded my expectations.\nI spent the entirety of the\nshow skirting actors, hoping\nto not get called, but also\ncurious enough to tail them\nfrom a safe distance and not\nmiss out on the juicy drama.\nRoaring twenties fashion\ndoesn\u2019t exist in London now,\nfor good reason. It\u2019s simply\ntoo cold, as was Gatsby\u2019s\nDrugstore. But amidst\nmasking the shivering for\njazz hands, the open bar\nthroughout the show made\nthe chills less uncomforta-ble. Gatsby\u2019s Drugstore is a\nshady derelict building, but\nwith a charm capturing the\nhedonistic pleasures of the\n1920s. Large dance floors,\ntwo bars, balcony, and other\nhidden rooms are left for the\naudience to roam through\nand explore, just like in a\nhouse party.\nThe chandeliers, sofas,\nand pianos scream osten-dance with Miss Baker, and\nan audience member ranked\nthe best dancers. Everyone\nwas in character (but my\nhurt for not being chosen\nwas real). Throughout the\nshow, the arguing characters\nwould storm off taking some\nof the audience with them,\nforming allies. Ms Baker\ndragged me and some other\nladies to Daisy\u2019s room and\nwe decided what she should\nwear to her tea with Gatsby\n(we had to settle for a white\ndress because Daisy\u2019s maid\nhas no sense of style and\ndidn\u2019t pack anything good\nenough).\nThe premise of the show\nis to transform and take the\naudience to the times of\n1920s America for about 85\nminutes. They did this very\nwell, judging by some teary\nfaces at Myrtle\u2019s funeral.\nWhat\u2019s even more special\nis that all your reactions\nand contributions matter\nand make a difference to the\nspecifications of the story.\nThe active improvisations\nwere a testament to the skills\nof the actors, with special\nmention to Ivy Corbin\n(playing Jordan Baker) who\nclearly stole every scene\nwith her glamorous persona.\nFor those Fitzgerald fans\nwho are looking to appreciate the literature and the Daisy-Gatsby dream team, sadly\nthis isn\u2019t a show for you. But\nfor the Gatsby fandom who\nend (\u201cphones in the 1920s\nwould shock the people\nout of their minds\u201d), the\nCharleston dance moves\nyou learn will make you the\nsuavest person during your\nnext night out.\nISSUE 1714\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nDisha\nBandyopadhyay\nArts Writer\nWhere?

    "content": "Tap Here to Stop Food Waste\nSUSTAINABILITY\nMonami Miyamoto\nSustainability Editor\nThree entrepreneuring startups come together to discuss tackling food waste. Monami Miyamoto reports\nStart-ups tackling food-waste: DayOld (Left), ODDBOX (Top right), and OLIO (Bottom right) \\\\\\ DayOld, ODDBOX , OLIO\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nO\nn February\n11th the Social\nI n n o v a t i o n\nAcademy at\nLSE (London School of\nEconomics) hosted a talk\ntitled \u2018The War on Food\nWaste\u2019, with 3 entrepreneurs from start-ups\ntackle food waste. These\ncompanies included\nODDBOX, DayOld, and\nOLIO, each represented\nby their founders or board\nmembers.\nFood waste is becoming\nan increasingly hot topic,\nespecially in the UK\nwhere there is growing\nsocietal awareness about\nits consequences on the\nplanet. In fact, if food\nwaste was a country, it\nwould be the third biggest\ncontributor to climate\nchange just after the\nUnited States and China.\nA brief introduction to\nthe three companies:\nODDBOX aims to\nreduce food waste from\nthe farm, by sending\nproduce that do not live up\nto supermarket standards\nto its subscribers across\nLondon.\nDayOld collects artisan\npastries from bakeries,\nthat would also otherwise\nget thrown out. These are\nthen provided as catering\nfor company events or\ngiven to people suffering\nfood poverty. It\u2019s shocking\nto think that bakeries such\nas GAIL\u2019s were throwing\nout up to 20 perfectly\nedible loaves of bread\neach day, before DayOld\ndecided to aprtner up with\nthem.\nFinally, OLIO is a\n\u201cFood tinder\u201d app, as\ntheir business development manager Liam Jones\nput sit. Individuals and\nsupermarkets list foods\nin their homes/shops that\nthey no longer want, so\nthat someone else in the\nneighbourhood who may\nwant it can have it.\nInterestingly, all three\ncompanies are tackling\nfood waste, but at different levels of the food\nsupply chain: ODDBOX\non the farm, DayOld in\nthe stores, and OLIO in\nthe homes.\nOne of the major issues\ndiscussed in the talk was\nthe complex reality of\nmanaging both social and\neconomic welfare in these\nbusinesses. DayOld mentioned that their company\nis too commercial to\nreceive social enterprise\nfunding but is also not\neconomically profitable\nenough to attract large\nnumbers of investors. To\ncombat this, they are currently relying heavily on\ntheir extensive volunteer\nnetwork. The benefit is\nthat this enables nurturing\nof close inter-personal\nrelationships as well as\nencouraging commitment\nfrom volunteers. The\nspeaker from DayOld\nacknowledged that this\nelement of their business\nis appealing to customers\n(such as the companies\nthey cater for).\nPersonally, what I\nfound more shocking was\nthe fact that 16 of the full-time staff at OLIO have\nlittle to no pay, because\nit is currently a free app.\nTheir representative\nspeaker made clear that\neventually their business\nwill have to be mone-tized in order to expand.\nAnother issue OLIO\nfaces is the maintainence\nof a high standard of risk\nmanagement, because\nfood exchange happens\nat a very local scale, so\npeople have to be responsible with what they give/\ntake. When they work\nwith supermarkets such as\nSainsbury\u2019s to take their\nunwanted food, a business\ndonor agreement is used\nto ensure food safety.\nThus, it seems appropriate\nto conclude that managing\na start-up involved in\nsocial welfare has its fair\nshare of difficulties.\nHowever, the main\npoint of the talk was to\nshow that with the right\nbusiness strategies it is\npossible to overcome the\nhardships and slowly, but\nsurely, grow like these\nthree companies.\nAll three speakers\nmade a very inspiring\npoint on the power of\nhaving multiple food\nwelfare social enterprises\nat different levels of the\nfood supply chain. As the\nrepresentative of DayOld\nput it, \u201cAll three of our\ncompanies are not competing against each other.\nRather, we are competing\ntogether against food\nwaste\u201d. This statement\nwas followed by the importance of small start-up\ncompanies with a similar\nmission, to collaborate effectively in order to raise\nawareness.\nOf course, it must be acknowledged that the lack\nof competition and scope\nfor collaboration is more\nspecific for ODDBOX,\nDayOld and OLIO as they\nfocus on different stages\nof the supply chain. For\nexample, OLIO did state\nthat \u201cToo good to go\u201danother app that provides\nconsumers with food that\nis about to go bad (for\na cheaper price than the\noriginal), is one of their\ncompetitors. But gener-ally, because these companies are not motivated\npurely by economic gains,\nthey are more amenable to\nworking together.\nFurthermore, the\nco-founder of ODDBOX,\nEmilie Vanpoperinghe,\noptimistically pointed\nout that consumers are\nincreasingly beginning\nto take interest in sustainability conscious\ncompanies. This leads to\na positive feedback loop\nwherein businesses gradually adapt to these needs,\nproviding sustainable\nproducts, which further\nraises awareness amongst\nconsumers.\nOverall, the talk was\nfairly casual, yet informative and inspiring. I\nbelieve there is still a lot\nof potential for more start-ups to take their place in\nthe expanding niche of\nsustainable business, and\nact as a driving force for\nsocietal good.\n\n"

The dresses of the\nHouse of Dior combine\nfantasy and futurism \u2013 the\nexoticism of far-flung\ncountries, the allure of\ndelicate flowers, and the\nold-world grandeur of\neras long past. It is not\nmerely a dress that is sold\nto us, but a dream; not just\nan everyday garment to be\nworn, but a rare piece of\n\u2018ephemeral architecture\u2019.\nThis February, the\nV&A plays host to the\nlargest retrospective of\nthe House of Dior ever\nseen in the UK. Spanning\nfrom Christian Dior\u2019s\nfirst collection in 1947\nto the work of current\ncreative director Maria\nGrazia Chiuri, it features\nover 200 hand-stitched\ngarments drawn from both\nthe Dior archives and the\ncollections of the V&A.\nThe exhibition opens\nwith none other than\nDior\u2019s Bar Suit, an\nemblem of his revolutionary \u2018New Look\u2019.\nPresented in his debut col-lection, the ultra-feminine\nsilhouette with its cinched\nwaist and full skirt was a\nradical departure from the\naustere, utilitarian look\nof the postwar period. Its\nunapologetic decadence\n\u2013 a single dress requiring\nyards of fabric to create \u2013\nsparked protests and took\n1950s Paris by storm.\nThis explosive start is\nbut the opener to eleven\ncarefully-curated rooms of\nDior design, all exquisitely presented in immersive\nsets designed by Nathalie\nCrini\u00e8re. The second\nroom, for instance, showcases dresses that Dior\ndesigned over the course\nof his career. It is strikingly presented: the entire\nroom is dark, leaving the\nfocus squarely on the\ndresses, each enclosed\nwithin a mirrored box\nand lit by the soft glow of\nfluorescent light.\nWhile many of the\npieces were showcased at\nthe Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris last year,\nthe London exhibition is\nmuch altered from its Paris\nrendition. V&A curator\nOriole Cullen shows off\nDior\u2019s ties to Britain with\na section dedicated to exploring his self-confessed\nAnglophilia. Prominently\ndisplayed here is the\nextravagant off-shoulder\ndress famously worn by\nPrincess Margaret on her\n21st birthday, as well as\ndresses worn by fashionable English clients such\nas Nancy Mitford and\nMargot Fonteyn.\nOf course, this exhibition is not just about\nChristian Dior alone.\nBeyond the first few\nrooms, the designs of the\nman himself are seamless-ly blended with those of\nthe six creative designers\nwho succeeded him.\nWe view the dresses by\nthemes that have inspired\neach successive generation of designers: flowers,\n18th century court\nfashion, cultures from\naround the world. Yves\nSaint Laurent, Gianfranco\nFerr\u00e9, John Galliano\u2026 all\nbrilliant designers in their\nown right. An entire room\ngives us the opportunity\nto see their individual\ninterpretations of the Dior\nstyle, displaying dresses\nby each of the designers\nalongside quotes and a\nbrief biography.\nCrini\u00e8re\u2019s sets continue\nto amaze, with \u2018The\nGarden\u2019 room featuring\ndelicate paper sprays of\nwisteria cascading from\nthe ceiling, and \u2018Diorama\u2019\nshowing off an impressive\ncolour-coded cabinet of\nshoes, bags and tiny scale\nmodels of iconic dresses.\nThe oft-forgotten ateliers\nget a look-in too, with a\nfloor-to-ceiling display of\nwhite linen toiles (dress\nprototypes) used in the\nmaking of actual Dior\npieces.\nBut the best is saved\nfor last. At the end of the\nexhibition, we enter a\ndazzling grand ballroom.\nElegantly dressed mannequins stand in groups\naround us, decked out in\nthe unashamedly opulent\nimagination of Dior\ndesigners from past to\npresent. Mirrors multiply\ntheir images infinitely,\nso that we feel like\nwe\u2019re actually at a ball,\nsurrounded by beautiful\npeople in their beautiful\ngowns. From Dior\u2019s\nmulti-petalled Junon\n(1949) to Galliano\u2019s\nSilvery Water Harlequin\n(1998) and more recent\nballgowns worn by celebrities on the red carpet,\nthey stand proudly under\nan ever-changing ceiling\n\u2013 one moment the deep\nblue of a starry sky, the\nnext a Renaissance fresco\nbathed in golden light. It\nspeaks to the timelessness\nof Dior\u2019s designs.\nThis is a theme underscored by the final dress,\na delicate confection of\npleated silk tulle entitled\n\u00c9ventail de vos hasards\n(Fan of Your Chances).\nCreated by Chiuri for the\nShanghai presentation\nof her Summer 2018\ncollection, it was in fact\ninspired by a handpainted\nfan designed by Dior\nhimself in 1950. Like the\nfan, the dress too bears his\nsignature: a connection\nfrom past to present.\nFrom the iconic Bar Suit\nall the way to the halls of\nShanghai, the Dior style\nhas remained a classic in\nthe ever-evolving world\nof fashion.\nDior: Designer of\nDreams provides a beautifully curated, comprehensive look into the world\nof the renowned designer.\nThe crowds flocking to\nthe Sainsbury wing are a\ntestament to his enduring\nlegacy. With the V&A just\nminutes from Imperial,\nwhy not take a break\nfrom the dreary world of\nlectures? Step into Dior\u2019s\ndream world of elegance\nand glamour, if only for a\nlittle while.\n\u2018A ballgown is your dream, and it must make you a dream\u2019- Christian Dior // Adrien Dirand\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

String 1 and PSA\npro, Seigo \u201ctop shot knot\u201d\nMasuda suffered a defeat\nat the hands of Singapore\nnumber 5 and fellow\nPSA pro Chua Man Chin\nin a closely contested\nmatch.

However, this only\nspurred the team on, with\nthird string Cam \u201cit\u2019s a\nroller\u201d Morrison securing\nsome especially crucial\nvictories for their spot in\nthe knockout stages.\nSaturday evening was\nspent fraternising with the\nenemy over a Roehampton home cooked lasagne\nand a special treat for the\ndessert: a Q&A session\nwith world number 6 and\nCommonwealth silver\nmedallist, Sarah-Jane\n\u201cThe Markswoman\u201d\nPerry.

The 1sts\nagainst a strong Durham\nteam and the 2nds against\nlast year\u2019s semi finalists\nLeicester. Leicester\nproved too strong for\nthe 2nds this time round.\nBut a quarterfinal finish\nalongside other 1st teams\ncertainly shows that IC\nSquash has strength in\ndepth to be proud of.\nAs for the 1sts, they\nbrushed Durham aside\nwith a resounding 5-0\nvictory.

Then came time for\nthe Final everyone had\nbeen talking about, not\nleast the LSE team who\nwere overheard in the\ndressing room plotting our\ndownfall \u2013 they had sussed\nus out.

Seigo, recovering from his earlier\nloss, deployed a tactical\nmasterclass. The slaying\nof the slayer ensured the\ntitle was once again in IC\nSquash hands. Two strings\nremained \u2013 dead rubbers?\nNo chance. Enter \u201cThe\nTree Chopper\u201d and \u201cThe\nHound\u201d to ensure there\nwas no silver lining for\nthe LSE. A 5-0 emphatic\nchampionship victory!\nAll credit to LSE for their\nfighting spirit and they\nwill certainly be back\nnext year to challenge us\nagain for the title.

With an early\nstart from the organisers\nto set up registration and\nbring the food, the crowds\nstarted arriving at 10 in the\nmorning to Metric so they\ncould sign their teams in.\nSoon enough, all teams\nhad registered and made\ntheir way to the Bandstand\nin Hyde Park where the\nrace would soon begin.\nAs the clocks struck\n1pm,therecentlyretrieved\nHyde Park Relays Horn\nwas sounded, as per tra-dition, to mark the start of\nthe race, as the first runner\nfrom each of the 85 teams\nstormed off in a stampede\nwith cheers of teammates\nspreading across the park.\nThe course was newly\ncertified as officially 5km,\nmeaning many runners\nwere eager to set personal\nbest times.\nAs the first runners\nmade it to the end of their\nleg, Daniel Mulryan from\nImperial Men\u2019s A team\nwas leading the race with\nwhat would earn him the\nfastest leg of the day in\n15:16, followed closely\nby the Cambridge team,\nas he gave the baton to\nMihaly Ormay.

    "content": "Nerone and Poppea - Falling for the Villains\nThis Valentines Day, Arts Writer Maria Portela reflects on one of opera\u2019s great romances... how can we love the\nunlovable?\nMaria Portela\nArts Writer\nL\niterature, movies\nand plays are\nall filled with\ncouples that we\nlove to love. Be it with\n\u201chappily ever after\u201d fairy\ntales or tragic romances,\nwe, as an audience, tend\nto be in favour of those\ncharacters who live their\nstories for the pursuit of\nlove. We gladden when\nthey meet, find ourselves wishing for their\nhappiness, weep when\ntragedy pulls them apart,\nand excuse their flaws\nor poor choices with the\nrighteousness of their mo-tives. On the other hand,\nanyone who opposes our\nfavourite fictional couples\nand threatens them being\ntogether is vicious and\ndeserves punishment.\nThere is an underlying\nassumption that someone\nwho is capable of love\nmust a good person and,\nconversely, that the bad\nguys don\u2019t get to love\nand should suffer eternal\nloneliness instead.\nThe protagonists of\nMonteverdi\u2019s opera L\u2019incoronazione di Poppea\nseemingly defy all these\nconceptions. Both historical figures, Nerone (Italian\nfor Nero) and Poppea are\nall but virtuous.\nHe was a Roman\nEmperor, known for\nmatricide, extravagance\nand tyranny, chief suspect\nof the Great Fire that in\n64 AD destroyed half of\nRome, and the first serious\npersecutor of the new-ly-born Christian faith.\nShe was an ambitious\nnoblewoman, known for\nmarrying her way to the\ntitle of Roman Empress\nand plotting the murder\nof everyone who opposed\nher along the way. Hardly\nyour typical boy meets\ngirl story\u2026\nDuring the course of the\nopera,whichliberallycon-denses historical events\nfrom several years into a\nsingle day, we accompany\nthe machinations that lead\nto Poppea\u2019s ascension\nto the throne. These\ninclude adultery, political\nintrigue, treachery, forced\nsuicide, disguise, divorce\nand the exile of Nerone\nand Poppea\u2019s respective\nwedded partners. Of\ncourse, because we\u2019re\ntalking of Baroque Opera,\none or two mythological\ngods must make their\nappearance. Eventually,\nPoppea is crowned\nempress while divine\nchoruses of Cupids\nand Graces dub her the\ngoddess of beauty on\nearth, and Roman Consuls\nand Tribunes praise her\nsovereignty over \u201cthis\nhappy empire\u201d.\nThe opera ends with\nits most iconic musical\nnumber, a delicate duet\nwhere Nerone and Poppea\npledge eternal love (see\nright).\nThis piece is often\nperformed in concert\nhalls, where it is easily\nregarded simply as a\nbeautiful love song. But\nwhen we analyse it within\nthe broader context of\nthe opera, our collective\n\u201caudience morality\u201d\nbecomes at stake. Because\nwe have just seen (for\nthe past two hours!) how\nterrible those people two\nare, and yet, their song\nsomehow captivates us.\nWe hate their tyrannic\nhabits and we know from\nHistory that they turned\nout to be even crueller\nthan the opera portrays\nthem. Roman historians\nclaim that real life Nerone\nkicked a pregnant Poppea\nto death, a mere three\nyears after marrying her:\nhow\u2019s that for true love!?\nBut yet, in those brief\nmoments, we pick their\nside and secretly wish for\nvillains!\nThe truth is no one can\nresist a good love story,\neven if it is a wicked one.\nAs L\u2019Incoronazione di\nPoppea proves, this can\nbe achieved by a trick as\nsimple as changing the\nlens through which the\nstory is told. By focusing\non evil characters, this\nopera makes them more\nrelatable and thus more\ndeserving of experiencing\nevery facet of human life.\nAs we learn their\nmotives, we tend to read\ntheir deeds at a more\nfavourable light. No, we\ndon\u2019t forgive them. But\nwe might concede that\neveryone should have\na chance to love and to\nbe loved, no matter how\nreprehensible their actions\nare.

This\nis the question Bertolt\nBrecht poses to us in his\nplay The Good Person of\nSzechwan. Set in Sichuan,\nit tells the story of how\nthe gods reward a poor\nprostitute Shen Te, \u2018the\nonly good person in the\ncity\u2019, with enough money\nto buy a small tobacco\nshop. Unfortunately,\nShen Te\u2019s kindness is\nimmediately exploited by\nall and sundry, so that she\nis forced to invent an alter\nego \u2013 her straight-talking,\nmerciless cousin Shui\nTa \u2013 to restore order\nand rescue the business.\nDespite her reluctance to\nbring out Shui Ta, \u2018he\u2019 has\nto stay for ever-increasing\nperiods of time, eventually subsuming the virtuous\nShen Te. There is, after\nall, no place for the good\nin a world such as ours.\nFor those unfamiliar\nwith Brecht, the German\nplaywright was best\nknown for his \u2018epic\ntheatre\u2019, highly political\ntheatre that aimed to get\nthe viewer to think critically about contemporary\nissues. He popularised\nthe Verfremdungseffekt\n(\u2018estrangement effect\u2019):\nby constantly breaking\nthe fourth wall, audiences\nwere prevented from immersing themselves in the\nevents of the play, forcing\nthem to think critically\nabout what was being\npresented on stage. Brecht\nwent so far with the \u2018Veffect\u2019 as to read stage\ndirections out loud, hold\nup placards to indicate\nsubtext, and rearrange\nthe set and lighting in full\nview of the audience.\nWhile highly influential in concept, his plays\nare rarely performed in\nfull nowadays for obvious\nreasons \u2013 people aren\u2019t\nvery fond of going to\ntheatres to be lectured.\nYury Butusov\u2019s exuberant rendition of The\nGood Person of Szechwan\nbreathes fresh life into\nBrecht\u2019s parable-play.\nAmbitious in scope and\nbuzzing with energy, his\ndirection has the talented\nactors of the Moscow\nPushkin Drama Theatre\nsinging, dancing, and\neven riding bicycles\nacross stage. The acting\nis at times hilarious,\nat times touching, but\nalways fierce. Butusov\nachieves the V-effect not\nby stripping the play of\nits entertainment value,\nbut rather by kicking it up\nto eleven and sprinkling\non a touch of the surreal.\nA three-hour long play\nin German and Russian\nreally shouldn\u2019t be this\nenjoyable. Part vaudeville\nact, part oratorical play,\nButusov manages to make\nBrechtian theatre both\nentertaining and highly\naccessible.\nIn true Brechtian\nfashion, the set designed\nby Alexander Shiskin\ncontributes to the sense\nof disconnect between\naudience and actors.\nElements of the set are\nscattered loosely about\nthe stage and picked up\nas necessary to play their\npart in different scenes. A\nsingle door stands in for an\nentire house; microphones\nstand ready for the cast to\ngrab when they burst into\nsong. Gigantic images,\nthematically related to\nwhat\u2019s happening on\nstage, are projected darkly\non the back screen. A nod\nto Brechtian placard-hold-ing, but so subtle that you\ndon\u2019t notice till you look\nup and it\u2019s suddenly there.\nThis being a theatre\ncompany from Moscow,\nthe play itself is in\nRussian, but the original\nGerman songs by Paul\nDessau are kept. The\nGerman pronunciation\noccasionally leaves\nsomething to be desired,\nbut thank goodness for\nEnglish subtitles! Musical\ndirector Igor Gorsky has\na lot on his plate: not just\nDessau\u2019s German songs,\nbut an entire soundtrack\nof jazz numbers, revues\nand rock music which all\nenliven the play.\nMiss Mi Tzu (Irina\nPetrova), Shen Te\u2019s\nupper-class landlady, has\na hilarious theme song\nthat plays whenever she\nminces across the stage,\nwhile the leather-clad\npoliceman (Aleksey\nRakhmanov) belts out\nhis lines like a rock star\nfrom the \u201870s. Lively\njazz sets the scene for\nwild cavorting by the\nlocal ne\u2019er-do-wells, who\nall want a piece of Shen\nTe\u2019s newfound wealth;\nmeanwhile, Ryuichi Sakamoto\u2019s aching \u2018Merry\nChristmas Mr Lawrence\u2019\nis played when Shen Te\nfalls in love with her\npilot (who sadly, like the\nrest, only wants to exploit\nher). This is all manfully\ncarried out by a four-per-son live band who are a\nconstant presence on stage\nthroughout the play, and\nshould really be credited\nin the programme.\nThe staging is lavish,\nawash with beautiful,\nsurreal images. Wong, the\nwater-seller (Alexander\nMatrosov), frequently and\nsymbolically makes use\nof dry sand. Rice rains\nfrom the sky as a god\nrides a bicycle through a\nforest of gaunt trees. Shen\nTe (Alexandra Ursulyak)\nconverses with her alter\nego Shui Ta who, improb-ably, is walking calmly on\na treadmill in the middle\nof a forest. In one of the\nmost dramatic scenes,\nempty cigarette packets\nrain down like gold,\nwhile Shen Te, alone on\nstage but for a full-length\nmirror, confronts her own\nreflected image.\nDualityisamajortheme\nof the play, and Ursulyak\nplays both sides of her\ncharacter with aplomb. It\nis easy to see the conflict\nbetween her good-hearted\nnature and her inability to\nsurvive while being true\nto herself; the harsh reality\nof Brecht\u2019s world inexorably crushes the goodness\nout of her. Matrosov as\nthe destitute water-seller\nalternates between a\npitiful cripple and a sort\nof messenger to the gods.\nThe three gods here are\ningeniously replaced by\na single actress (Ana-stasia Lebedeva) who\nappears thrice in different\nincarnations, all equally\nenigmatic.\nButusov\u2019s compelling\nproduction makes us\nlaugh, but also forces us to\nthink. When Brecht wrote\nhis play in 1941, war was\nbreaking out around the\nworld. Just months after\nthe first performance\nof The Good Person of\nSzechwan, the United\nStates would formally\ndeclare war on Japan in\nresponse to the attack on\nPearl Harbour. Events\ntoday are not quite as\nbleak, but it is a question\nworth considering in any\nera. Is our world so cruel\nthat there is no place for a\ngood person in it? Either\nthey must go mad, as with\nPrince Myshkin in Dostoevsky\u2019s The Idiot, or they\nmust turn evil themselves,\nas with Shen Te.\nWhen called upon, the\ngods prove to be useless,\nand Brecht turns to the\naudience to demand an\nanswer for our paradoxical world. Butusov\ncondenses Brecht\u2019s final\ncall to action into a single,\npowerful word from Shen\nTe: \u2018help!\u2019\nWhile the Moscow\nPushkin Drama Theatre\nhas sadly left London,\nthey will be back again in\nJune, this time to perform\nFrancis Beaumont\u2019s 17th\ncentury parody \u2018The\nKnight of the Burning\nPestle\u2019.

Straying very little\nfrom the source material,\nthe game gives you\nthe true Resident Evil\nexperience of terror, fun\nand intense inventory\nmanagement! So, allow\nme to be your guide in this\nnot-so-wholesome tour of\nRaccoon City!\nTaking place in said\nRaccoon City, your\nstandard run-of-the-mill\nsmall city is situated in\nmidwestern US. Despite\ngoing by the surprisingly\nnice name of Raccoon city,\nit isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019d\nexpect, as our unfortunate protagonists Claire\nRedfield and Leon S.\nKennedy find themselves\nnot enjoying their visit\nin what is apparently a\nzombie-infested hellhole.\nWhat could possibly bring\nthem to the city? Well,\nClaire is searching for her\nbrother, Chris, whilst Leon\nis enjoying his first day on\nduty as a Police Officer\n(which is a well-deserved\nFML situation).\nUpon arriving, they\nfind that things may not be\ngoing as well as expected,\nwith zombie-filled streets\nand abandoned fiery\nvehicles littered every-where. Wandering around\nthe city trying to find out\nwhat happened, our two\nprotagonists attempt to\ninvestigate the city and try\nto make it out alive. The\nplot thickens more and\nmore as details emerge\nabout a pharmaceutical\n\u201cStraying very\nlittle from\nthe source\nmaterial, the\ngame gives\nyou the true\nResident Evil\nexperience\u201d\n\u201cCapcom\nreleasing\nupcoming DLC\nfor free!\u201d\ncompany being responsible for the crisis that has\nbefallen Racoon City. Unfortunately, said company\nis inclined to not leave any\nsurvivors to tell the tale,\nleading to an additional\ndash of gasoline being\nadded to the dumpster fire\nthat is Raccoon city; in the\nform of BOWs (Bio-or-ganic weapons) and other\nterrifying man-made\nmonstrosities.\nOverall, the story is\nquite simplistic\u2026on\nsurface that is, but, just\nlike the story and its\nlocation upon digging\ndeeper, it has a lot more\ngoing on than one would\nexpect, with a tonne of\ndetails relating to other\ngames and a plethora of\nthemes and subplots including romance, betrayal\nand corruption. RE2 is\na real mixed cocktail of\nemotions.Thestorystrings\nyou along and provides\nbackground information\nthrough the player finding\ndossiers, documents and\ncomputer files throughout\nthe game. This leads to a\nfantastic feeling of immersion and pacing as by\nthe end you find all your\nquestions answered (for\nthe most part, you still\nneed to complete all the\ncampaigns to fully satiate\nyour Scooby Doo mystery\nsolving needs). You heard\nme correctly, there are\nmultiple campaigns including Claire A, B, Leon\nA, B, Hunk\u2019s campaign\nand the legendary Tofu\nrun, with the last being a\ngag campaign. Now you\nmay be wondering what\nall this A and B nonsense\nis, and I can tell you it\u2019s\nsomething that makes the\ngame all the better, with A\nand B denoting different\ncampaigns where characters take an alternative\npath to the original; B\nis only unlocked after\ncompleting A and also\nincludes its own secret\nboss.\nNow onto gameplay,\nfeaturing Resident Evil\n4 style gameplay but\nwith considerably better\ngraphics, the game plays\nexceptionally well. But\nbe warned, if you\u2019re new\nto the Resident Evil series\nand are expecting some\nform of hack-n-slash\nshoot \u2018em up, you are\npoorly mistaken. A staple\nfeature of RE2 remake\nis that ammunition is\nscarce and you don\u2019t have\na full armoury of six or\nmore weapons; gradually\nthroughout the game\nyou will upgrade your\nweapons and every so\noften acquire a new one (a\nmaximum of 4-5 weapons\nper campaign). Just acting\nas General Hindsight yet\nagain: don\u2019t expect to\npop a cap in every single\nzombie you see, sometimes it\u2019s simply better to\nwalk past or dodge them.\nThis is because, unlike\nthe classic action horror\nstereotype, it requires\nmultiple shots to the head\nto take down a standard\nzombie. Putting aside the\ndetails of the action genre,\nthe horror element of the\ngame really comes into\nMr. X\u2019s soliciting business has yet to receive any declinations// Capcom\n\u201cwith\nnumerous\nthemes and\nsubplots\nincluding\ncorruption,\nbetrayal and\nromance; RE2\nis a real mixed\ncocktail of\nemotions\u201d\nplay when running low\non ammo or dealing with\nenemies that you\u2019re not\nnecessarily well equipped\nfor, i.e. a massive trench-coat-and-matching-hat-wearing brick shit-house\ncombined with Arnold\nSchwarzenegger\u2019s Mr\nFreeze, minus the puns.\nThe game is a remake\nafter all, so how does it\nvary from the original\nyou might ask? Honestly\nspeaking, there are quite\na lot of variations from\nthe original, for example\nLieutenant Marvin\nBranagh actively helps\nthe player as opposed to\nbeing dead the moment\nyou walk into the police\nstation, along with a lot\nof other details that I\ncannot mention due to\nmy desire not to spoil the\ngame too much (you can\u2019t\nget me for the Lieutenant\nMarvin spoiler, that was\nin the demo!). But overall\ncertain scenes play out\nsomewhat differently\nfrom the original, with\none minor boss fight being\na welcoming variation\nfrom the original. Also,\nfor all you arachnophobes\nout there they\u2019ve taken\nthe giant spiders out of\nthe remake, so the game\njust may be palatable for\nyou now, if you get past\nall the gore and footstep\ninducing panic. It may not\nhave spiders included but\nfor those wanting to intensify their feeling of nos-talgia, Capcom currently\nhas DLC that allows for\nthe original game\u2019s music\nto play instead of the remastered soundtrack. The\nremastered soundtrack,\nby the way, is fantastically well done and also\nincludes some touching\nnew additions.\nOverall, Resident Evil\n2 remake has my seal of\napproval, ditching the\ntypical bad camera angles\nthat plague the early\ngames, RE2 really shines\nas a perfect example of\nhow to remake a game\nand then just make it that\nmuch better. The only\nfault that I could possibly\nhave with the game is that\nthere isn\u2019t more, however,\nthis may be sufficed with\nthe upcoming DLC that\nCapcom is adding for free!\nAnd if that isn\u2019t enough for\nyou, mods and costumes\nare available on steam to\ncustomize your experience even more *cough*\nhaving DMX play every\ntime Mr X appears *end\ncough*. So happy hunting\nfor ammo as you have\n\u2018DMX- X Gon\u2019 Give It To\nYa\u2019 playing as Mr Freeze\nchases you.\n\n"

Books writer Rahul\nMehta explores the reasons why and what we can do about it.\nD\nespite the\npower of\nprose and\nverse to drag\nus from our seat on the\nTube (or grim university\nflat) to the Victorian\nslums or outer sectors\nof the Galactic Empire,\nBritish literature is still\nbeing held back. While\nthe characters in books\ntranscend time and\nspace, the non-fictional\npeople who write and\npublish the books suffer\nfar greater restrictions in\nterms of diversity.\nThe data is damning.\nThe \u2018Writing The\nFuture\u2019 report into\ndiversity in the literary\nworld was published in\n2015, and it made for\nstark reading. At the\ntime, only 4% of guests\nat literary festivals were\nfrom a black, Asian, or\nminority ethnic (BAME)\nbackground. Malorie\nBlackman, author of the\nyoung adult novel series\nNoughts and Crosses and\nco-author of the report,\nlamented a decline in\nrepresentation at these\nevents. Rianna Walcott\nis the co-editor of The\nColour Of Madness, a\nliterary anthology about\nBAME mental health.\nShe speaks of a notable\nabsence of people of\ncolour on discussion\npanels at literary events.\nPerhaps that\u2019s unsur-prising, considering\nthat no books written\nby ethnic minorities\nwere recommended for\nWorld Book Day, nor\nWorld Book Night. It\nseems that the \u2018World\u2019\ndoes not extend beyond\nthe West\u2019s shores. In\nfairness, the event\norganisers complained\nthat no publisher had\nput forward any books\nby writers of colour. No\nwonder, when BAME\nwriters struggle to\neven start their literary\ncareers, with 53% of\nthis group without an\nagent, compared to 37%\nof white authors. Thus,\nthe lack of diversity\nat literary festivals is\nreally only the tip of the\niceberg - the issue of diversity permeates every\nlevel of publishing.\nSo how do we respond\nto poor representation\nacross the literary board?\nWe can develop our own\nspaces. The Jhalak Prize\nfor books by writers\nof colour offers such\na platform for growth,\noffering a \u00a31000 prize\nfor the winner. The\n2018 winner, Reni Eddo-Lodge, was shortlisted for other awards for\nher book, Why I\u2019m No\nLonger Talking to White\nPeople About Race.\nFor those not fortunate\nenough to win the prize,\nthere are other funding\noptions. Nikesh Shukla,\neditor and contributor to\nThe Good Immigrant, a\ncollection of essays by\nBrits from immigrant\ncommunities, reached\n204% of his funding\ntarget through the\ncrowd-funding publish-er, Unbound. Whether\nit\u2019s recognition or re-sources, there is always\nthe option of finding\nsupport through one\u2019s\ncommunities.\nHowever, prizes and\ncrowd-funding carry\ntheir own problems.\nNikesh Shukla fears that\nhis \u201cskin colour is being\nseen as a trend and not\nsomething that\u2019s about a\nsocietal good\u201d. Are these\ninitiatives performative\nvirtue-signalling by\nnewly \u2018woke\u2019 corpo-rations, or affirmative\naction? For comedienne\nShappi Khorsandi, the\nidea of attaching a price\nto one\u2019s skin colour\nled to her withdrawing\nher submission for the\nJhalak Prize. Tokenism\nextends beyond concerns\nabout perceived success.\nIn the \u2018Writing the\nFuture\u2019 report, several\nauthors complained\nabout being expected to\nwrite solely about their\nrace, and specifically\nthrough a colonial lens.\nOne author spoke of\nhow, after refusing to\nwrite about the British\nRaj and racial deference\nof the governess-high\nmaharajah dynamic, she\nresorted to approaching\npublishers in India.

Hopefully, this book will set a\nprecedent for more writers to come forward, to describe\ntheir unique journey. Long overdue! - RM\nThe Colour Of\nMadness reminds us of\none of the greatest powers\nof storytelling: giving a\nvoice to the voiceless.\nThrough anthology of\nverse, prose, and arts,\nthis book is a rallying cry\nto the alienated and the\nalone. In the perfect storm\nof cultural stigma, mental\nhealth cuts, and rising\nracism and xenophobia,\nthis collection of writings\nserves as welcome refuge\nfor the vulnerable, and a\nsuccess. This dubious\nnotion of authenticity\nperpetuates stereotypes\nand restricts the inclusion of new voices. But,\nhow do we increase\ndiversity in an equitable\nmanner that neither\npunishes white authors,\nnor fetishises BAME\nauthors, and still ensures\nthat our society remains\na thriving community of\nliterature?\nThe report\u2019s recommendation sums it\nup best. The authors\nadvocate for a greater\nrecruitment drive,\nallowing people of\ncolour to take up managerial positions. In\ndoing so, the gatekeep-ers of the literary world\nwould be more open to a\ndiverse range of submis-sions. In the meantime,\npublishing bodies\ncan undergo audits to\nidentify cultural bias in\ntheir selection process.\nBeyond the recom-mendations, grants and\ninterest-free loans can\nhelp working-class\nethnic minorities to\npursue literary careers.\nPenguin Random House\noffers 6-month internships to ethnic minority\napplicants, with Faber,\nHarper Collins, and\nHachette following\nsuit.

She is co-editor of The Colour Of Madness, a literary anthology\nabout BAME mental health, alongside Dr Samara Linton. Here she chats to Books writer Rahul Mehta about her\nwork.\nBOOKS\nRahul Mehta\nBooks Writer\nRahul Mehta: Where\ndid the idea for The\nColour of Madness\ncome from?\nRianna Walcott: I was\ngiving a talk in Edinburgh\nabout mental health in the\ncreative industry, and I\nwas the only black woman\non the panel. People\nseemed interested in my\nperspective, and I was\napproached by my future\npublisher. She suggested\nan anthology dedicated\nto BAME experiences of\nmental health.\nIt was definitely a\nBAME-led project: by\nus, for us, about us. My\nco-editor, Samara, had\nwritten as a journalist and\nan academic about black\nmental health, so we came\nin with both personal\nand formal experience\non writing about mental\nhealth.\nHow did you plan and\norganise your vision?\nWe started with seeking\nfunding. It was largely\ncrowd-funded, with some\nfunds coming from the\npublisher and creative\narts funding. Samara and\nI handled the publicity in\nBAME spaces. Most of\nthe press about our book\nwas by women of colour\nin their spaces: Media Diversified, gal-dem, Black\nBallad. We also featured\nin The Guardian, the\nMetro, and the BBC. But\nfirst of all, we wanted it to\nbe in the hands of people\nof colour.\nWe had Facebook\nfocus groups with over\n100 individuals. Samara\nand I held brainstorming\nsessions about the book\u2019s\ndesign and organised a\nlarge digital campaign to\nget submissions. We went\nbeyond academic spaces:\nwe went to service-user\nled charities, to find people\nof different backgrounds.\nWere you informed by\npersonal experiences\nof mental health?\nEveryone on the team\nhad some experience of\nmental health conditions,\nincluding depression and\nanxiety. This was not just\nan outside interest. In\nSamara\u2019s case, she was\nable to see things as a\npatient AND a practition-er. The reason we make\nsuch a good partnership\nis because she has the\nmedical background\nwhile I have the literary\nbackground (Rianna has\nan undergraduate and\nMasters degree in English\nLiterature).\nI\u2019m impressed by the\ndiversity of voices in\nthe book.\nThe book reflects\nwho is most comfortable\ntalking about their mental\nhealth. For example, we\nhad tons of submissions\nfrom black and Asian\nwomen, but barely any\nfrom black and Asian\nmen. Male contributors\ntend to be practitioners\n(e.g. Asian doctors), or\nLGBT+. Most contributors were second or third\ngeneration immigrants.\nBut we have lots of\npeople across different\nintersections. This highlights the diversity in\nspaces like the black com-munity, e.g. the difference\nbetween those of African\nand Caribbean descent.\nIt brings a lot of nuance\nthat is missing from the\nconversation.\nWhatwasyourbiggest\nobstacle?\nMoney! We are all\nnovices to this, and no\none could have known\nthe demand would be\nthis high. We have had\nfour print runs (unheard\nof in small print press).\nWe have grown from our\nmistakes and learned a\nlot from the publishing\nprocess.\nOne funny thing is that\na lot of white men submit-ted, some even pretending\nto be BAME. We\u2019d\nrespond by pointing them\nto our Patreon. If you\u2019re\nnot going to support us\nwith coin, then what are\nyou doing?\nWhat\u2019s your best\nmemory?\nPeople coming up to\nus at our events, in tears,\nbecause of how much it\nmeans to them. A contributor will be reading their\npiece at an event, and\nsomeone in the audience\nwill begin to weep a little\nbit. This is the first time\nthat someone has been\nable to say this out loud,\nthe first time that someone\nhas been seen. It\u2019s been\nan incredible privilege to\nfacilitate that.\nYou recently said:\n\u201cThis cannot be a\nconclusion. It is closer\nto a beginning.\u201d What\nis your plan for the\nbook?\nWe want to build on\nprevious achievements.\nIt\u2019s on a university\u2019s\nsyllabus; someone even\ntook it into Parliament!\nWe want to see it every-where, so that everyone\nunderstands that our\nexperiences are unique.\nThe book is the tip of the\niceberg though, with only\n58 perspectives.

We\nhave taken the decision\nto cease breakfast service\nfor the time being in order\nto lay firm foundations.\nThese foundations will\nset us up for the future\nand ensure the long term\nviability of our outlets in\norder to better serve our\nmembership.\u201d\nAfter the disastrous\nperformance of Union\nBreakfast during its trial,\nstakeholders, such as students and Union staff have\nraised the question of why\nthe trial was launched in\nthe first place without firm\nfoundations already being\nin place.\nAccording to Rob,\ncompetition with the\nbreakfast offering in the\nLibrary Caf\u00e9 was a substantial obstacle: \u201cOne of\nthe main factors we struggled with is the Library\nCaf\u00e9 do run breakfast,\nit\u2019s a very similar offering\nto our own and, overall\nCampus Services put\nin \u00a31m subsidy a year.\nWhich means they can\ngo down to costs that we\nliterally just can\u2019t match.\u201d\nThis comes as the\nlatest development in the\nongoing efforts being\nmade to improve the catering offerings on campus.\nRob informed Felix that,\n\u201cClaudia has been putting\na lot of work into the food\noffering on campus with\nCampus Services because\nthey have a considerably\nbigger budget than us,\nthey can do all sorts of\nthings.\u201d\nDespite the failure of\nthis short-lived breakfast\ntrial, students are being\nreassured that this does\nnot mark the end for\nbreakfast offerings on\ncampus. Reflecting on\nthis, Rob added: \u201cWe are\nvery much still looking\ninto reviewing breakfast\nbut, at this point, we need\nto actually look at all the\ninformation we got, the\ncustomer feedback, the\nperformance reports and\nso on. Actually try and\nfigure out why is it that\nwe\u2019re only making \u00a317 a\nday. Why is it only four\npeople are having food\nhere each day? When it\ncomes round to next budg-eting, look at what the\nlessons learnt are because\nstudents do need food but\nclearly what we\u2019re doing\nat the moment isn\u2019t what\nthey want\u201d.\nThe most important meal of the day // Imperial College London\nNo more // Imperial College London Scrapped! // Imperial College London\n\n"

The\nnow 31-year-old rapper\nwas still going by K-Dot\nand would shortly receive\na career-changing cosign\nfrom Lil Wayne. Today\nhe is one of the best\nknown and certainly most\nrespected artists in music.\nWith twelve Grammys\nand four platinum records\nunder his belt \u2013 not to mention the first Pulitzer prize\nawarded to a non-classical\nor jazz musician \u2013 few\ncan claim to have been so\nsuccessful in both critical\nand commercial fields.\nBut as the 2010\u2019s \u2013 or\nteens, as this decade may\nbe (hopefully not) known\n\u2013 draw to an end, music\nfans everywhere must ask\nthemselves, \u201cwhat was the\nbest album the decade?\u201d\nFor many the answer will\nbe a project by Kendrick\nLamar \u2013 but which? The\ndecision may at least\nbe narrowed; only two\nof Duckworth\u2019s records\npack the lyrical, musical\nand conceptual punch to\nbe up for consideration.\nWhile both Section.80\nand DAMN., have many\na good quality between\nthem, neither match the\nprecision and cohesion\nof our two contenders: To\nPimp A Butterfly and good\nkid, m.A.A.d city.\nCritical heavyweight To\nPimp A Butterfly (TPAB)\nclocks in with eleven\nGrammy nominations,\nfive wins, and platinum\nstatus. \u2018How Much A\nDollar Cost\u2019 even earned\nthe top spot on Obama\u2019s\nsong of the year list. With\nbrazen influences from\njazz, funk, and soul, the\nrecord is an ear opening\nexperience; every track\nboasts instruments and\ntextures a hip-hop historian would be hard pressed\nto find on any other\nrecord in the genre. From\nThundercat\u2019s bubbly licks\nslinking all over opener\n\u2018Wesley\u2019s Theory\u2019 to the\nskipping beat, warped, and\nincreasingly trippy vocals\n(courtesy of a Sufjan\nStevens sample) of \u2018Hood\nPolitics\u2019, Lamar\u2019s bold ex-perimentalism serves the\nrecord well. \u2018For Free?\u2019\nbrings a wailing big band\nto Lamar\u2019s caricaturish\ndemands for wealth from\nan exploitative record\nindustry (\u201cI need forty\nacres and a mule / not a\n40 ounce and a pit bull\u201d)\nblending together to\ncreate a surreal swagger.\nAnother standout moment\nfrom \u2018u\u2019 sees a distant\nsample hopping seemingly at random from ear to\near in your headphones,\nwhile K-Dot murmurs to\nhimself, suicidal and depressed in his hotel room,\ncreating a supremely\npalpable moment.\nbetween scenes from the\nlyricist\u2019s adolescence with\nless regard for chronology\nthan Quentin Tarantino,\nits tales stitched together\nby a collection of voice-mails and conversation\nrecordings that are surely\nnow quintessential to the\nhip-hop art form. The\nmoralofouryoungprotagonists\u2019 story is also played\nout through these scenes,\nfirst on \u2018Sing About Me,\nI\u2019m Dying of Thirst\u2019,\nwhere Lamar encounters\nan elderly neighbour\n(Maya Angelou), who\noffers him baptism as the\nbeginning of a new life.\nThe wordsmith\u2019s mother\nalso makes an appearance\non the album\u2019s penultimate track, advising him\nto follow music and \u201ctell\nhis story\u201d.\nTPAB on the other hand,\ntakes a more refreshing\napproach with tracks concluded by a spoken word\npoem \u2013 one which grows\nas Kendrick\u2019s journey\nthrough fame and racial\npolitics goes on. Only on\nthe final track is it read\nin its completed form,\nalongside an \u201cinterview\u201d\nbetween Lamar and\nTupac, sculpted from old\ninterview clips and finally\na second poem, this time\nfleshing out the metaphor\nof the inner butterfly \u2013\n\u201ctalent\u2026thoughtfulness\u201d\nwithin a \u201cprisoner of the\nstreets\u201d, who exploits\nhis artistic streak to his\nadvantage, with turmoil\nensuing. While both interlude styles hem songs\ntogether effortlessly and\ndeliver a message similar\nbeyond coincidence,\nTPAB brings a more\nunique frame for its 16\ntracks to the table, as well\nas allowing it to deliver its\nmessage more powerfully.\nGKMC has an appeal\nthat lies not so much\nin pushing hip-hop\u2019s\nborders, but creating\nsomething original,\nintelligent, and catchy\nfrom its building blocks.\nLamar\u2019s first major label\nrelease cruises over lush,\ndark samples, with addic-tively catchy rhythms and\nhooks that make it both\nan engrossing experience\nand a fitting backdrop\nfor any party. With more\ntypical, though nonetheless gorgeous, production\nthan TPAB, the record is a\nfun and fascinating listen\nfor hip-hop fans, instrumentals laced with detail\n(and a healthy helping of\nOutkast influence) that\nsuit attentive listening\nas well as relaxation.\nLyrically Kendrick had\nfound the formula: flip a\nhip-hop trope on its head\nwith a hook that sounds\nas if the trope were being\nfollowed. The results?\nHits like \u2018Swimming\nPools (Drank)\u2019, \u2018Backseat\nFreestyle\u2019, and \u2018Bitch\nDon\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u2019,\nearning the record triple\nplatinum status.\nGKMC\u2019s setting in\nLamar\u2019s youth provides\nthe perfect backdrop for\nhim to critique everything\nfrom drinking culture to\nrap\u2019s habit of impossibly\nhyperbolic braggadocio:\n\u201cpray my dick get big\nas the Eiffel tower / so I\ncan fuck the world for 72\nhours\u201d. While this leaves\nKendrick open to criticism\nof having his message too\neasily missed, lines like\n\u201call I see is strobe lights\nblinding me in my hindsight\u201d and \u201cthis is cul-de\nsac and plenty cognac and\nmajor pain\u201d prove he has\nmore than enough skill to\neloquently balance catchi-ness with harsh reality.\nTPAB is not without its\nshortcomings; critiqued\nfor its self-indulgence, it\u2019s\noften dense. Abuzz with\nintense lyrics, complex\nharmonies, and rhythms\nwith song structures that\nveer off into new territory\nwithout warning, this\nrecord can be challenging,\neven on repeated listens.\nDense harmonies on\ntracks like \u2018Alright\u2019 and\n\u2018Complexion (A Zulu\nLove)\u2019 might centre their\nlyrics\u2019 reflection on black\nculture, but at the price of\nencumbering the grooves\nof the tracks. Contrastingly simple, raw tracks like\n\u2018The Blacker the Berry\u2019\nand \u2018i\u2019 are more than\nwelcome by the end of the\nrecord.\nIn many ways it is good\nthat Lamar has delivered\nhis powerful message in\ntwo distinct and thoroughly cinematic masterpieces;\nfans of the catchy hooks\nof GKMC might not hear\nout TPAB\u2019s seven-minute\nspoken word conclusion,\nwhile those enjoying\nthe complexity of TPAB\nmight not tolerate the\nsimple riffs of bangers\nlike \u2018m.A.A.d City\u2019. The\nconstant between the two\nrecords is the man behind\nthe mic \u2013 Kendrick Lamar\nwhose myriad voices,\ndense rhymes, and ingenious wordplay never cease\nto amaze.\nIn my opinion however,\nTo Pimp A Butterfly is\nsimply a more compelling\nand original piece of art,\nachieving something completely unique on tracks\nlike \u2018u\u2019, \u2018For Sale?\u2019, and\na significant remainder of\nits track listing \u2013 as well\nas delivering its message\nmore precisely. Earning\nit, in my eyes, a place at\nthe top of Lamar\u2019s discog-raphy.\nWhat\u2019s your album of\nthe decade? Let us know\nat fmusic@ic.ac.uk\nCriss-Cross! Everybody clap your hands! // Wikimedia\n\u201cLush, dark\nsamples, with\naddictively\ncatchy rhythms\nand hooks\u201d\nOne of Duckworth\u2019s\ngreatest talents is undoubtedly his storytelling\nability and both records\nbring it in spades, both\ndrawing from and dramatizing his personal experience to build a meaningful\nnarrative.

Debt and equity\nare two sides of the same\ncoin. A company may\nchoose to finance itself\nwith debt or equity or a\ncombination of the two.\nThe company approaches\nbanks or investors for a\nloan and/or to sell a stake\nof the company to raise\ncapital.\nDebt in simple terms,\nrefers to the amount of\nmoney borrowed by the\nborrower from the lender.\nThe debt agreement\nusually involves the\nrepayment of the amount\nborrowed plus interest\nto the lender. Interest\nis charged on debt as\ncompensation to the\nlender for taking on the\nrisk of the loan while\nalso incentivizing quicker\nrepayments to reduce the\nborrower\u2019s overall interest\nexpense. The risk of a debt\nrefers to the probability of\nthe borrower defaulting,\ni.e., the borrower being\nunable to repay the\nloan and/or its interest\npayments. We are familiar\nwith debt in the form of\nstudent loans, auto loans,\nmortgages and credit card\ndebt. Businesses also\nuse debt to finance the\nacquisition of assets, e.g.,\nmachinery, real-estate and\nraw materials. In both\ncases, the business and\nthe individual issue debt\nwhile the bank takes on\nthe (carries the risk of)\ndebt in return for interest\npayments.\nIndividuals, banks and\nother institutions can\nalso take on the debt of\na business by purchasing\nits bonds. Bonds are loans\nin quarterly and annual\nreports to allow investors\nto gauge a company\u2019s\nshort and long-term\nfinancial health.\nLike how one is wary\nof lending money to a\nconsistently indebted\nfriend, a company with\ntoo much debt is seen\nas risky and financially\nunhealthy and are termed\nhighly leveraged as debt\nis leveraged to finance\noperations. While not\nevery highly leveraged\ncompany is a bad one,\nleveraging makes future\ndebt more expensive\nas potential investors\nwill expect a higher\nreturn in exchange for\nlending money to a risky\ncompany.\nInstead of issuing debt,\na company may choose\ninstead to sell a portion\nof the company in return\nfor capital. Equity often\nrefers to a share or any\nother form of investment\nvehicle that represents\nan ownership interest. If\none purchases a single\nshare in a company that\nsplits and sells 100% of\nits ownership into 100\nshares, one owns 1% of\nthe company. While debt\nrepresents an obligation\nto repay a loan, equity\nrepresentsownership.This\ndefinition differentiates\nholders of debt as the\ndebtors of the company\nwhile holders of equity\nas the owners. Holders\nof equity are entitled to a\nportion of profits as well\nas voting rights on matters\npertaining to the company.\nShareholders are eligible\nfor dividend issuances and\nvoting rights at general\nmeetings. Dividends are\nexcess profits distributed\nas cash-handouts per share\nto reward shareholders\nand incentivize their\ncontinued vested interest\nin the company.\nThe characteristics\nmentioned above are\nthose of common shares.\nCompanies can also issue\na form of equity known\nas preferred shares.\nPreferred shares also\nrepresent ownership of\nthe company. However,\npreferred share-holders\nare entitled to a fixed\ndividend payment whilst\ncommon share-holder\ndividends are subject\nto the company\u2019s\nperformance and approval\nby the board of directors.\nDividends on preferred\nshares are pre-determined\nand often larger than\nthose of common shares.\nIn times of insolvency,\nthe proceeds from the\nliquidationofthecompany\nfirst go to bondholders,\nfollowed by preferred\nshareholders and finally\nthrough an Initial Public\nOffering (IPO). The\nshares of the company\nare listed and traded on\na stock exchange for the\nfirst time, representing the\ninitial \u201coffering\u201d of shares\nfor sale to the public,\nalso known as a primary\noffering. The proceeds\nof the sales go to the\nissued by companies,\nmunicipalities, states and\nsovereign governments\nto finance operations.\nThey have variable or\nfixed interest payments.\nThey are an asset class\nknown as fixed-income\nsecurities as they provide\nperiodic interest payments\nat pre-determined interest\nrates. Bonds can be traded\n(bought and sold) publicly\non a stock exchange or\nprivately between private\nparties.\nDebt is found on a\ncompany\u2019s balance sheet\nunder the section of\nliabilities. Liabilities are\nsplit between current and\nnon-current, differing\nin their settlement date.\nThose due to be settled\nwithin a year or less\nare classified as current\nwhile those due later\nare non-current. Current\nliabilities are useful for\ngauging a company\u2019s\nshort-term liquidity. Debt\ncan be found in a plethora\nof vehicles as such bank\nloans, notes (short,\nmedium and long term),\nbond payables and lease\nagreements on assets the\ncompany is utilising but\ndoes not own.

The\ngeneral rule is; debt is\ncheaper than equity. This\nis best understood with\nan example. If a company\nrequires \u00a330,000 pounds\nto finance its business\noperation, it could issue\n\u00a330,000 in bonds paying\nan annual 5% interest or\nit could sell a 10% stake\nin its business. If the\ncompany performs well\nand makes \u00a3100,000 in\nprofit in a year, the bond\ninterest will be \u00a31,500\nwhile the 10% stake will\nrepresent \u00a310,000 of profit\nowed to shareholders. The\ncompany will have saved\n\u00a38500 in profit by issuing\ndebt instead of equity. In\nthis situation, the cost of\nequity is more than the\ncost of debt.\nThe key idea is; debt\nrepayments represent a\nfixed-expense liability,\nthat is removed once the\ndebt is paid but equity is a\nlong-term obligation to the\nshareholdersandadilution\nof ownership as the\ncompany is split amongst\nmore shareholders. These\ncould represent a boon or\na curse depending on the\ncompany. Start-ups, small\nplayers in large industries,\nhighlyleveragedfirms and\nother young companies\nwith unstable cash flows\nwill find accessing cheap\ndebt, i.e., issuing debt at\nlow interest rates, near\nimpossible as investors\nare not willing to part\nwith their money for a\nrisky company without\na proportionately higher\nreturn. As a result, most\nturn to venture capital for\nfinancing, selling stakes\nin their company in return\nfor capital. Larger, more\nestablished firms have\npredictable and reliable\ncashflows that grant them\naccess to cheap debt and\nare unlikely to issue new\nequity.\nAnother aspect that\nattractive.\nDiscount rates of the\ncentral bank will influence\nthe use of debt. The central\nbank requires financial\ninstitutions to hold a\nportion of money in the\nreserves at the end of each\nbusiness day. This reserve\nrequirements ensures\nbanks have enough money\ntucked away to meet\ncustomer withdrawals.\nThe discount rate is the\ninterest rate central banks\ncharge banks and other\nfinancial institutions\nfor loans to meet the\novernight requirements.\nFluctuations in the\ndiscountratewillaffectthe\ninterest rates bank charge\non loans to companies.\nIf the economy requires\nstimulation, the central\nbank will lower the\ndiscount rate. Since banks\ncan now loan money from\nthe central bank at a lower\nrate, it encourages them\nto lower their own rates\nfor customers, making\nthe debt market more\nappealing. During times\nof inflation, when the\neconomy needs to \u201cslow\ndown\u201d, the reverse is true\nand a company may find\nthe interest rates on their\ndebt increase, thereby\nincreasing their cost of\ndebt.\nDebt and equity,\nrepresenting capital\nobtained from different\nmeans, form the capital\nstructure of a company.\nThe optimal capital\nstructure is one that\nachieves the lowest\nWe i g h t e d - Av e r a g e -Cost-of-Capital.. Capital\nstructures vary largely\nby industry. Cyclical\nindustries such as mining\nand airlines are unsuited\nfor high amounts of\ndebt as the unstable\nrevenue streams creates\nuncertainty surrounding\ndebt repayment. Banking\nand insurance, however\nrequire large amounts of\nleverage, hence hight debt\nis the norm. The role of\nmonitoring and optimisng\nthe capital structure falls\non the Chief Financial\nOfficer. This role is often\nused interchangebly\nwith the title Chief\nInvesment Officer, though\nresponsibilities may\ndiffer across companies,\nindustries and countries.\nIt falls on this individual\nto strike a delicate balance\nbetween each side, taking\ninto account internal and\nexternal factors, to finance\na company throughout its\nlife time.\nSale of common shares are recorded as share capital on the balance sheet // Tesco PLC, Interim Results 2018/19\ninfluences a company\u2019s\nmethod of financing are\nthe wider market forces.

    "content": "ISSUE 1714\nFELIX\n8\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLondon is at knife\u2019s edge: fatal stabbings at\nrecord high\nHow can we handle the situation?\nPOLITICS\nAaron Hadley\nPolitics Writer\nL\nondon has a knife\nproblem. By the\ntime of writing,\nten people have\ndied in 2019 from stab\nwounds. By the time\nyou are reading this, that\nnumber will likely have\nincreased by two or three.\nBut people are not just\nnumbers on a spreadsheet.\nLives are being lost, and\na blanket of fear is descending upon the youth\nof London. Knife crime\nhas increased year on\nyear since 2014, with the\ngreatest increase among\nyoung people, namely\nthose between 13 -17. In\nfact, there are over 1,000\nrecorded admissions to\nhospital for young people\na year just from stabbings,\nand this has risen by 60%\nsince 2013. Why is this\nhappening, and how can\nwe address it?\nExperts refer to\nknife crime as a \u2018health\nproblem\u2019. They do this\nbecause knife crime\nspreads like a disease. If\nknife crime were a disease,\nthen we are very close to a\npandemic scenario. More\nand more teenagers are\ncarrying knives because\nthey are afraid. There is\nthis illusion that carrying\na knife will make you\nsafer, that you are less\nlikely to be stabbed if you\ncarry a knife. However,\nthe opposite is true. The\nescalation of a situation to\nviolence is far more likely\ngiven the false sense of\nsecurity and confidence\npeople experience when\ncarrying a knife. To give\nan interesting analogy,\ndrivers who have taken\nlessons to learn how to\ndrive safely on ice are\nmore likely to have an\naccident on ice, as they\noverestimate their own\nability and become confi-dent. The combination of\nfear and false confidence\nresults in more and more\nviolent crimes, which\nhas reached the highest\non record, over 250,000\noffenses in London alone\nfor 2017.\nThe young are more\nvulnerable to this kind of\ncrimes, in both carrying\nknives and being wounded\nfrom them. Students who\nare expelled from state\nschools are most likely\nwithin their age group to\ncommit offenses. They\nare also perfect targets for\nrecruitment from gangs in\nLondon.\nWhat has been\ndone so far?\nIn response to the\nproblem, Sadiq Khan the\nLondon mayor launched\na task force of 272 in\nFebruary 2018, whom in\nthe first six months made\n1,361 arrests, and seized\n340 knives and 40 fire\narms. Inching closer to\nthe source of the problem,\nevery London school has\nbeen offered access to\nknife wands, to detect\nstudents carrying knives.\n200 schools have taken\nup the offer thus far.\nGlasgow once held one of\nthe highest murder rates in\nwestern Europe. But since\ntreating knife crime as a\nhealth issue, the number\nof offensive weapons has\ndropped by 69% over a\ndecade. The number of\nchildren and teenagers\nmurdered has dropped\nto zero for five straight\nyears (2011 \u2013 2016).\nExperts who worked with\nGlasgow police to tackle\nviolent crime there have\nsince come to London,\nworking with the Mayors\noffice to help to solve\nLondon\u2019s problem.\nWhat else can be\ndone?\nThis is a good start,\nbut it does not tackle\nthe heart of the matter.\nYoung people, especially\nthose from disadvantaged backgrounds, or\nhave mental health or\nbehavioral issues, are\nturning to crime. They do\nand social opportunities\nto young people in a safe\nenvironment.\nThey are often touted\nas great institutions for\npreventing youth crime\nand for collaborating with\npolice.Butinthepastthree\nyears, funding has been\ncut down by a third. In my\nhometown, the youth club\nwas forced to close. Some\nresearch suggests that\nwell-run youth clubs help\nreduce crime, but poorly\nfunded and badly supervised clubs can encourage\ncrime alongside other\nsocial problems such\nas underage drinking.\nThe number of students\nexpelled from school has\nincreased year on year\nsince 2013, hitting 35\na day in 2015. School\nspending on students was\ncut by 8% since 2010,\nwith the greatest cuts\nbeing sixth form funding\nat 25%. Often, schools and\nsixth forms do not have\nthe resources to address\nthe situation of problematic students or to offer\nthem additional support. It\nis now easier for schools\nto expel students than to\nallocate enough resources\nfor them to continue. As\nwell as tackling knives on\nthe street and the sale of\nknives to young people,\nthe government needs to\nstop the source of these\ncrimes, in a compassionate way.
