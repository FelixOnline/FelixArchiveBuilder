Some are\nsweeter than others,so make ensure\nyou sweeten the soup to taste.\nIf you feel like the list of\ningredients here is too long, please\nfeel free to substitute or adjust \u2013 the\neasiest way is by using a ready made\nmix of spices, such as the Green\nThai Curry paste made by so many\nsupermarkets. Likewise, with all the\nheat going into it \u2013 chilli, paprika,\netc. \u2013 knock this up and down as it\nsuits you.\nSpiced Squash\nSoup Recipe\nPreheat your oven to 200C/180\nFan. Peel your squash/gourd of\nchoice \u2013 this may require a sharp\nknife, for varieties that defeat your\npeeler.\nCut in half and scoop out the pulp\n\u2013 any seeds can be separated out and\nreserved. Dice into approximately\n1\u201d/2.5cm cubes and place into\na large mixing bowl. The size\nconsistency isn\u2019t that important, but\nit\u2019s a good exercise in knife skills.\nTo this bowl, add the oregano,\nthyme, sumac, smoked paprika\nand a good few grindings of black\npepper, along with approximately\n3 tbsps of your chosen cooking oil\n\u2013 enough so that when you mix all\nthis together,the cubes of squash all\nhave a light coating of spices and oil.\nToss thoroughly,and spread evenly\nonto an unlined (no tinfoil here)\nbaking tray \u2013 or two, if necessary.\nStick in the oven and let roast for\n~40 minutes, or longer, until the\ncubes are very browned with a little\nbit of blackening.\nDuring cooking, make sure to stir\nthe squash around in the tray, so\nthat all the pieces get a chance to\nbrown, and feel free to add a splash\nmore of oil if you feel that they\u2019re\nnot browning well.\nWhilst that\u2019s happening, prepare\nthe garlic, ginger and galangal.\nUse a teaspoon to scrape the skins\nfrom the ginger and galangal first,\nand then puree. If you don\u2019t have a\nMicroplane, which, again, I think\nis the easiest way to do this, then\nyou can finely dice them and mash\nthem in a mortar and pestle, with a\nlittle bit of coarse salt. Alternatively,\nfeel free to struggle with your garlic\npress, but I hate those things. Use a\nmortar and pestle (or spice grinder,\nif you have one) to finely powder\nyour star anise and Szechuan\npeppercorns.\nHere we see squash in their natural habitat, huddling for warmth. Photo Credit: Wikicommons\nW\nhilst making lunch\nthis weekend, I\ncame up with a\nrecipe inspired by\nsome of the flavours of South East\nAsian cuisine.It could accommodate\nfor the surfeit of squashes that I had\nand was also nicely warming.I won\u2019t\npretend it comes from any specific\nSouth East Asian country \u2013 let alone\nthat is a recipe with any tradition \u2013\nas it contains spices from all parts of\nthe world. However, it tastes damn\ngood and I\u2019m quite proud of it. Sod\nthe provenance.\nA note: not all the ingredients\nare essential to this recipe, and I\nam sure that it will still taste fine\nwithout them. However, it\u2019s not\nthat hard to find most of them,\nnowadays. Galangal, a rhizome\nsimilar to ginger, is still uncommon\non supermarket shelves, but is very\ncheap in any Asian markets, which\nare also the best place to find cheap\nlemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and\nszechaun peppercorns. The latter\nhave a highly unusual property:\nthey contain a compound that,\nin sufficient quantities, will make\nyour whole mouth tingle. This is\nquite disconcerting the first time,\nbut will get you going back for\nmore and more. If you\u2019re concerned\nabout having to buy large packets\nof fresh herbs and not being able to\nuse them before they go off, don\u2019t\nworry. They freeze very well. In fact,\nI find it easier to prepare galangal\nwhen frozen, so that\u2019s an added\nbonus. For preparing garlic, ginger\nand galangal in this manner, I find\na Microplane to be the best tool\npossible, as it gives a uniform pulp\nand is very speedy.\nIn terms of squashes, butternut is\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nFood Editor\nDice your chilli, removing the\nseeds and membranes if you don\u2019t\nfancy too much heat. Finely chop\nyour onions, and add them to the\nlargest pot you have \u2013 mine is about\n5l, and it finishes almost full \u2013 with\na good glug of oil. Turn the heat to\nmedium high, and add the minced\nherbs, along with the lemon grass\nstick, anchovies, ground cinnamon,\npeppercorns, start anise and kaffir\nlime leaves.\nLet this fry, stirring occasionally,\nuntil the onions have disintegrated\nand are starting to brown.\nMeanwhile, zest the limes and\njuice them.When it looks as if most\nof the moisture is gone from the pot,\nand caramelising has started to set\nin, deglaze it with the lime juice.\nBy this point, your squash should\nbe tender \u2013 poke with the top of a\nknife to test, and it should slip in\neasily. Add the squash to the pot,\nand use a splash of stock to remove\nall the lovely browned bits from the\nroasting trays \u2013 add it to the pot as\nwell.\nNow add the two tins of coconut\nmilk and approximately half the\nremaining stock, and leave the\nwhole concoction to simmer whilst\nyou tidy up and have a break.\nWhen the liquor smells divine and\nyou can\u2019t wait any longer, remove\nthe lemongrass stick and use a hand\nShopping List\nFor 12 hearty portions, or more\n\u2013 it will keep very well, in fridge or\nfreezer.\n(\u201c*\u201d indicates ingredients that can\nsimply be replaced with 2tbsps of\ngreen thai curry paste, if you can\u2019t\nfind them easily or simply don\u2019t\nwant to bother - I won\u2019t judge.)\n2 kg Squash \u2013 see note above\n2 tbsp oregano\n1 tbsp thyme\n1 tbsp smoked sweet paprika\n1 tbsp sumac*\nBlack pepper, to grind\nOlive or other neutral cooking oil\n4 cloves garlic\n5cm piece of ginger\n5cm piece of galangal*\n1 green chilli, or more\n4 medium red or white onions\n1 stick lemon grass*\n4 anchovies - in oil or salt*\n1 tsp ground cinnamon*\n1 tbsp Szechaun peppercorns*\n1 star anise*\n6 dried kaffir lime leaves, or fresh\nif you can find them*\n3 limes\n~800ml stock \u2013 any meat or\nvegetable stock works well, or use a\ngood quality stock cube.\n2 tins (800ml) coconut milk\nTabasco\nFish sauce*\nSoy sauce\nFine salt\nCaster sugar\nThis is not\na recipe\nwith any\ntradition\nblender to carefully puree the soup\nto the smoothest consistency you\ncan achieve.

The \u2018breakthrough\u2019 was made\npossible through the hermit nation\u2019s\n\u2018\u2019wisdom, technology and power\u2019\u2019\nand was, according to the hermit\nnation itself, completed \u2018\u2019safely and\nperfectly\u2019\u2019 and above all humbly.\nIndeed, the same day, the United\nstates Geological Survey recorded a\n5.1 magnitude earthquake.\nHowever, the global community\nhas met North Korea\u2019s claims with\nscepticism, as, according to experts,\nthe data suggests the detonation of\na much weaker weapon than that of\na hydrogen bomb.\nAnalysis of the resulting\nWhat we hope North Korea\u2019s claims of a hydrogen bomb amount to. Photo\nCredit: Robin Zebrowski\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nNorth Korea claims H-bomb success\nH is for hermit rather than hydrogen\nearthquake\u2019s waveform shows a close\nsimilarity to earlier detonations,\nwith estimated power between\nseven and ten kilotons. This is not\neven half as powerful as the atomic\nbombs dropped on Japan \u2013 let\nalone comparable to the strongest\nH-bomb ever made, capable of\ngenerating 21 kilotons.\nIn fact, the weapon detonated by\nDPRK was more likely to have been\na boosted bomb than a legitimate\nH-bomb. A H-bomb is generally a\ntwo stage device. It utilises a small\nfission bomb, which in turn releases\nthe power necessary to kickstart the\nsecondary fusion explosion in the\nform of x-rays.\nA booster bomb, on the other\nhand, uses the heat generated by the\nfission bomb to ignite a small fusion\nexplosion, which is used simply to\nincrease the rate and yield of fission.\nIt is therefore much weaker than a\nlegitimate H-bomb.\nTo know with certainty what\nhappened, we would have to\nanalyse the blast\u2019s products. Fusion\ngenerated neutrons are significantly\nmore energetic than those produced\nduring fission, so a H-bomb blast\nwould create a radically different\nradioisotope mix than a fission\nbooster bomb blast.Fortunately, this\nis detectable by the global network\nof radioactive noble gas detectors\noperated by The Comprehensive\nTest Ban Treaty Organization,\nwhich will soon have results.\nDespite the doubtful success of the\ndetonation, the global community is\nfar from happy with the progress\nof North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\nOfficial statements from China,\nJapan, Russia, the EU and NATO\ncondemned the test, urging North\nKorea to cease its illegal and\ndangerous behaviour. Meanwhile,\nthe US and South Korea warned\nthat \u2018\u2019North Korea\u2019s provocations\nshould have consequences\u2019\u2019.\nTrue to its word, the US (or, in the\nwords of a North Korean statement,\nthe \u2018\u2019gang of cruel robbers\u2019\u2019)\nproceeded to a show of force.\nT\nhe elusive gravitational\nwave has been a source\nof excitement for\nphysicists ever since\nAlbert Einstein first predicted it\nin his theory of general relativity.\nHowever there have recently been\nrumours circulating the scientific\ncommunity that a gravitational\nwave has finally been detected.\nObservers at the Laser\nInterferometer GravitationalWave Observatory (LIGO) are\nlooking for evidence of ripples in\nthe fabric of space-time as a result\nof cataclysmic events \u2013 such as the\nmerge of two super-massive black\nholes or the collision of two neutron\nstars. These ripples travel outward\nfrom their source in the form of\nwaves. However, their amplitude\ngradually decreases over time, and\nit is thought that they are too weak\nto detect by the time they hit the\nearth. In fact, during its initial run\nfrom 2010 to 2012, LIGO failed to\ndetect any waves. And now it seems\nthat its $200 million revamp might\njust have done the trick. Or has it?\nRumours started to spread early\nlast September, barely a week after\nthe reopening of LIGO (now called\nAdvanced LIGO). They have been\nneither confirmed or denied, with\nofficial statements simply claiming\nthe data is still in the process of\nbeing analysed.\nHowever, Lawrence Krauss,\nthe cosmologist who first started\ntalking about the identification of a\ngravitational wave signal via twitter,\nstruck again last Monday, tweeting\n\u2018My earlier rumour about LIGO\nhas been confirmed by independent\nsources. Stay tuned! Gravitational\nwaves may have been discovered!!\nExciting.\u2019\nWhat exactly he means by\nindependent sources, whether they\nare independent from LIGO itself,\nand how anyone from outside the\nresearch programme can verify a\nstatement concerning its results,\nare all unclear. It seems this has\nalso confused Krauss himself, who\nperplexedly told ScienceInsider \u2018I\ndon\u2019t know how to be clearer\u2019.\nMany in the notoriously cautious\nscientific community have warned\nagainst getting too excited. The\nsignal could have been generated by\nthe observers themselves as a blind\ntest to be used in practice runs, and\nsuch tests have certainly happened\nin the past, as is pointed out by\nHarry Collins in Nature.\nIs it responsible to spread what\namounts to gossip? With LIGO\nrefusing to comment, and with\nthe standard process of scientific\nevaluation \u2013 including publication\nand peer review \u2013 far ahead in\nthe future, Krauss might just be\nsetting up not only the scientific\ncommunity, but also the interested\npublic, for disappointment.\nAs Michael Merrifield, an\nastronomer at the University of\nNottingham, responded, \u2018\u2019if true,\nyou are trying to steal their glory;\nif false, you are damaging scientific\ncredibility\u2019\u2019.\nIndeed, in the case of any solid\nevidence, I can\u2019t imagine anyone\nbeing more eager to spread the\nnews than the team responsible\nfor its generation. However, if the\nso-called gravitational waves turn\nout to be nothing more than an\nelaborate practical joke, public\nDid someone say gravitational wave?\nShortly after the press release, a pair\nof B-52 bombers were deployed,\ncapable of carrying nuclear weapons.\nHappy new year everyone.\nWhy we shouldn\u2019t get our knickers in a twist quite yet\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\ntrust in scientific expertise could be\ndamaged.\nSo to answer the question: did\nsomeone say gravitational wave?

Russell was trying\nto come up with a subject for his\nnext film, he made the unlikely\nchoice of Joy Mangano. Mangano\nis an American inventor, most likely\nunfamiliar to all those who don\u2019t\nown one of her \u2018miracle mops\u2019, or\nwho don\u2019t watch a large amount\nof QVC. But success can be found\nin the least likely of places, and his\nlatest film, Joy, while mainly serving\nas a vessel for Jennifer Lawrence to\nsink her considerable acting chops\ninto, has an infectious warmth and\nenthusiasm that makes it the most\nenjoyable of Russell\u2019s recent output.\nJennifer Lawrence is Joy, a\nstruggling mother whose home-life can be described as \u2018difficult\u2019\nat best: at the start of the film her\nfather (Robert De Niro) moves\nback in with her after breaking up\nwith his girlfriend; he has to share\na basement with Joy\u2019s ex-husband\n(\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez), who refuses to\nmove out years after the divorce. On\ntop of this she has her two young\nchildren, grandmother, and housebound mother to look after. At this\npoint, we begin to think the choice\nof Joy\u2019s name may be one of life\u2019s\nrichest ironies.\nBut Joy is hardy. An inventor at\nheart, she begins to work on a new\nkind of mop, one you don\u2019t have to\ntouch to wring out (this epiphany\nwas inspired by an incredibly\nbeguiling scene where Joy literally\nwrings out a mop full of shards\nof glass with her bare hands). She\nfaces setbacks and tribulations, but\nremains strong throughout, and\neventually prevails, fighting her way\nto the top of a capitalist shopping-channel hierarchy. The whole\nthing is a tongue-in-cheek look at\nthe American Dream, one where\nanyone can pull themselves up by\nthe bootstraps, as long as they are\nprepared to risk complete financial\ndestitution and losing their family.\nWhile the supporting cast are\ngenerally solid, the true stand-out is\nIsabella Rossellini, who is a wonder\nto behold on screen as Trudy, the\nrich widow who Joy\u2019s father meets\nthrough a dating agency, and who\ngoes on to finance the project. Her\nItalian accent, as sharp as cut glass,\nclashes wonderfully with De Niro\u2019s\nbroad New Yorker drawl,with such a\nrich cinematic history behind them,\nthe two have excellent on-screen\nchemistry that saturates every scene\nthey are in together.\nWhile David O. Russell manages\nto avoid some of the tropes that\nmade his last film, American Hustle,\nall flash and little substance (most\nnotably, he eschews the manic\ncamera motions that gave his\nviewers motion sickness), he retains\nhis penchant for utilising mental\nhealth problems as mere drivers of\nplot, as opposed to fully explored,\nnuanced portrayals. Like in Silver\nLinings Playbook, in which Cooper\nand Lawrence\u2019s mental health issues\nmainly manifested themselves in\na lot of frequent shouting, in Joy,\nthe fact that Joy\u2019s mother, Terri,\n(played by Virginia Madsen,\nhiding behind an awesomely-80s\nJennifer Lawrence and Robert De Nero, ensconced in domestic strife in Joy. Photo Credit: Twentieth Century Fox\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nJoy is\nthe most\nenjoyable\nof David O.\nRussell\u2019s\nrecent work\nDavid O. Russell\u2019s latest film mops up\nJennifer Lawrence is the main focus in this enjoyable though flawed biopic\npair of retro glasses) is completely\nunable to leave the house due to\nsevere agoraphobia is written off\nas more of an inconvenience for\nthe protagonist, as opposed to a\nproblem that should be addressed\nor explored.The overall effect of this\nhollowing out of character, which\nis found in numerous others in the\nfilm, is to make everyone else seem\nlike mere satellites, orbiting around\nplanet Jennifer.\nBut then, perhaps such an\nassessment is unfair. Aside from\nher well-known turn as Katniss\nEverdeen in The Hunger Games\nfranchise, Lawrence\u2019s career\nhas largely been defined by her\ncollaborations with Russell; this is\nthe third film of his she has starred\nin, and certainly her most realised\nperformance to date, which perhaps\nexplains the complete focus on her\ncharacter. One remarkable aspect\nof Lawrence\u2019s craft is her ability to\ncompletely absorb herself into the\ncharacter, until the lines between\nactor and role begin to blur. In\nJoy, she is completely believable\nas a downtrodden housewife,\nbuckling under her numerous\ncommitments; while at the end\nshe manages to achieve success\n(and everyone in the audience can\ncheer along), for most of the film\nshe is subject to disappointment,\nhumiliation, and desperation, and\nLawrence\u2019s strength goes some way\nto explaining why we don\u2019t want to\nwalk out halfway through in despair.\nWhile there are certain aspects of\nthe film that really don\u2019t work \u2013 an\nunnecessary voiceover that recurs\nthroughout the film, interrupting\nthe action; a ludicrously obvious\nset-piece that\u2019s clearly supposed to\nbe the emotional heart of the film,\nand is anything but, and a bizarre\nsoundtrack that skips between\nsongs and genres fast enough to\ngive you whiplash \u2013 when Russell\ngets it right,he really gets it right.In\nJoy, the eponymous emotion shines\nbrightest when Jennifer Lawrence is\nallowed to let rip,boosted by her co-stars: such moments come few and\nfar between, but when they do they\nshine bright.\nT\nhe director Quentin\nTarantino\u2019s eighth film\nis classically Tarantino,\nfilled with disturbing\nyet comic violence and brash yet\npoetic dialogue; if you didn\u2019t like\nTarantino\u2019s previous films, then this\ncertainly won\u2019t change your mind.\nSet a few years after the American\nCivil War, John Ruth the Hangman\n(Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter,\nis trying to get his bounty, Daisy\nDomergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh),\nto Red Rock before the blizzard\ncatches up with them. Before too\nlong he realises that they\u2019ll never\nget there in time, and so he finds\nhimself at Minnie\u2019s Haberdashery,\nwith two passengers he picked up\nalong the way. Knowing he\u2019s stuck\nin a cabin with people he doesn\u2019t\ntrust, paranoia begins to spread. But\nis the danger real?\nReminiscent of Tarantino\u2019s\ndirectorial debut, Reservoir Dogs\n(he even mentioned it as one of\nthe films that inspired The Hateful\nEight), the film consists almost\nentirely of people in a room\ntrying to work out what the hell\nis going on. This dialogue-heavy\nfilm requires your full attention,\nbecause any conversation could\nhave vital importance later on. But\nit requires more than just focus: it\nrequires patience. The film starts\nby meandering along, introducing\nthe eponymous \u2018Hateful Eight\u2019\nJoy\nDir: David O. Russell Script:\nDavid O. Russell Starring: Jennifer\nLawrence, Robert De Niro, \u00c9dgae\nRam\u00edrez, Isabella Rossellini. 124\nminutes.\nThe Hateful Eight\nDir: Quentin Tarantino Script:\nQuentin Tarantino Starring:\nSamuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell,\nJennifer Jason Leigh. 187 minutes.\none by one, but then takes a swift\nturn and all the subtle tension that\nwas bubbling under the surface\nspikes into an intensity that lasts\nthroughout.\nThe use of the Ultra 70mm\nPanavision \u2013 a choice Tarantino felt\nthe need to bring up fairly frequently\nin the film\u2019s publicity \u2013 was maybe\na little odd. Although it starts\noutdoors, where the super wide\naspect ratio makes the landscape\neven more dramatic, the majority\nis set inside, where the wideness\nhas little effect. More than likely it\nwas solely to make it look more like\na classic Western, and if this is so,\nthen it\u2019s understandable. Obviously,\nthis is not to say that it wasn\u2019t\nbeautifully shot; frequent Tarantino\ncollaborator Robert Richardson has\ncreated Tarantino\u2019s most beautiful\nlooking film yet.\nIn a film with all-round\noutstanding performances, Jennifer\nJason Leigh shone throughout:\nunstable, dangerous, and most of\nall simply terrifying. Plus she did\nhalf of this with blood covering her\nface. In an age where people are\nemphasising that women can play\nheroes, Leigh shows us that they\ncan play monsters just as well.\nOf course, the best element of any\nTarantino film is his dialogue and\nThe Hateful Eight is no exception.\nAs a writer, Tarantino captures\nhow everyone would like to speak,\nbut no one in reality does: this\nabsurdly eloquent way of speaking\nin paragraphs removes us from\nreality, allowing us to be okay with\nthe gruesome and equally absurd\nviolence.\nWith all its aspects coming\ntogether to form an intense and\nstrangely beautiful film, Quentin\nLe M\u00e9pris (1963)\nDir: Jean-Luc Godard. Script: JeanLuc Godard, Alberto Moravia.\nStarring: Brigitte Bardot, Michel\nPiccoli, Jack Palance, Fritz Lang.\n105 minutes.\nW\nhen it comes to\nJean-Luc Godard\u2019s\ncinema, plot\nsummaries can\nhardly do it justice. Such an attempt\nmerely demotes it too often into\ncommon melodrama. Le M\u00e9pris is a\ncase in point: screenwriter Paul Javal\n(Michel Piccoli) is hired to work on\nan adaption of Homer\u2019s Odyssey;\nsoon he struggles to collaborate\nwith both producer Prokosch (Jack\nPalance) and the great director\nFritz Lang (playing himself!);\nmeanwhile, his wife Camille\u2019s\n(Brigitte Bardot) sudden contempt\nfor him begins to trouble their\nmarriage. This is an adequate, yet\nostensible,interpretation \u2013 the truth\nis Le M\u00e9pris is really a self-reflective\nessay on love and alienation, cinema\nand reality.\nGodard is a rebel without a\ncause; the perfect example of a bad\nstoryteller. Watching Le M\u00e9pris,\none can immediately see the\ninfluence of Bertolt Brecht \u2013 the\nGerman playwright who provokes\nrational thoughts by reminding\nviewers that they are only watching\na play. Indeed, the artificiality\nof filmmaking radiates from the\nscreen at 24 frames per second. The\nopening scene sees Giorgia Moll\nwalking down the street followed by\nan entire crew, while a voice reads\nout the cast. Later on, in Lang\u2019s\nprojection room, I begin to ponder\nover safety regulations on film\nsets: surely anyone who has seen\nInglourious Basterds would worry\nwhen Paul lights up next to a pile\nof nitrate films. (And seriously, why\ndo they smoke all the time?)\nSo what makes this rambling,\ndistancing, arguably exhausting\nPhD-level meta-epic-theatre\ngreat? For one thing it has a\nbravura style, thanks to the\nmasterful cinematographer Raoul\nCoutard. With its crimson red and\nMediterranean blue, this film never\nceases to showcase its celluloid cool.\nA carefully calibrated scene features\nthe explosive physical appeal of\nBardot\u2019s Camille, lying nude next\nto her husband, who claims to love\nher \u2018totally, tenderly, tragically\u2019;\nthe muted darkness hides their\nexpressions from each other, from\na distance it looks like peace.\nCoutard\u2019s awe-inspiring shots run\nthrough the tricolour filter \u2013 red,\nwhite, and blue \u2013 and are juxtaposed\nagainst the sublime music done by\nGeorge Delerue, which adds an\nachingly nostalgic touch to this\nBrecht-esque film. It forces me to\nsurrender to its beauty \u2013 totally,\ntenderly, tragically.\n\u201cBrigitte Bardot? Beautiful. A\nbit over the hill, no?\u201d questioned\nMiko\u0142aj in Trois Couleurs: Blanc.\nNo, Miko\u0142aj, not even close.\nDelivering some fine acting, Bardot\nis the secret glue binding the film\u2019s\ncunning parallels. She inherits\nseveral blatant traits from Penelope,\nthe wife to Paul\u2019s modern-day\nUlysses, and more intriguingly,\nphysical features of Anna Karina.\nIn two separate occasions we see\nher donning a wig that curiously\nresembles Godard\u2019s soon-to-be ex-wife: a scene alludes to Antonioni\u2019s\nL\u2019vventura, where Claudia tries to\nbecome Anna by borrowing her hair\nas well as her fianc\u00e9. Much like an\nAntonioni film,this comical tragedy\nis an overt commentary about our\nbeloved director\u2019s rocky marriage.\nA strange selection from Godard\u2019s\noeuvre, Le M\u00e9pris still contains\nsome inspired vignettes, a whisper\nof films past.

But\nsometimes we need something we\nhaven\u2019t heard before; here are three\nfilms with cracking soundtracks:\nElevator to the Gallows\n(1958)\nA perfectly-made French crime\ndrama that anticipated the Nouvelle\nVague that would shake cinema to\nthe core, its Miles Davis score is\npitch-perfect. A legendary work\nin its own right, the score was\nreputedly produced in a single\nfrantic night of work. Watch Jeanne\nMoreau walk down the Champs\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the pouring rain to Davis\u2019\nagonising notes,and you understand\nwhy critic Phil Johnson called it \u2018the\nloneliest trumpet you will ever hear\u2019.\nKoyaanisqatsi (1982)\nA surprising hit that has come to\ndefine experimental cinema of the\n1980s,Koyaanisqatsi is a visual tone-poem that explores the mechanics\nof life, from the great to the small.\nAnd who better to score it than\nPhilip Glass, whose entrancing\nscore pulsates with energy. Drawing\non the sound of his avant-garde\nopera Einstein on the Beach, Glass\u2019\nmusic ranges from ominous droning\nto sparkling circuits \u2013 a perfect\naccompaniment to this meditative\nfilm.\nUnder the Skin (2013)\nA score that catapulted Mica\nLevi from underground name\nto cineaste\u2019s dream-boat, Levi\u2019s\nscore is the auditory equivalent of\na Richard Serra sculpture: dark,\ndank, ominous, and monumental, it\nis shot through with daring vision\nand originality. Trying to get across\nthe film\u2019s theme is no mean feat, but\nLevi manages to do so, forging from\nlooped synths and stabbing strings a\nscore that is utterly elemental.\nFRED FYLES\nThe best cinema of the next term\nFor others, the dawning of a new year may be a time for promising\nto try and sweat off the effects of mountains of holiday food, but for\nus it marks a whole new slew of upcoming releases. Here are the\nfive films released this term that we\u2019re most excited about:\nThe Assassin\nWhat may be the culmination\nof Taiwanese director Hou HsiaoHsien\u2019s career, which is midway\nthrough its third decade, The\nAssassin has been on the critics\u2019\nminds since it premiered at Cannes,\nwhere it earned Hsiao-Hsien the\n\u2018Best Director\u2019 prize. Set in the 8th\nCentury, The Assassin is essentially\na wuxia piece at heart, but what\ndifferentiates it from its cohorts\nis the laconic, meditative way\nHsaio-Hsien handles the camera.\nSlow moving, the beauty of the\nenvironment and the skill of Mark\nLee Ping Bing\u2019s cinematography\ncombine to make this one of the\nmost ravishing martial arts epics\nyou\u2019ll ever see.\nReleased 22nd\nJanuary\nYouth\nFollowing on from his Academy\nAward win for La Grande Bellezza,\nDocumentary corner: Man with a Movie Camera\nFred Fyles\nFilm Editor\nY\nou only need to watch\nabout 30 seconds of Dziga\nVertov\u2019s 1929 work Man\nwith a Movie Camera\nto understand why it is perhaps\none of the single most important\ndocumentaries of all time. Luckily\nfor you, it\u2019s all on YouTube, so go\nahead. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait. Well,\nyou see what I mean? Phenomenal,\nisn\u2019t it. Coming in as Sight and\nSound magazine\u2019s number one\ndocumentary ever made, Man with\na Movie Camera simply does what it\nsays on the tin: it shows us what one\nman and one camera can achieve,\ntaking us around 1920s Russia in a\ndizzying display of the art-form\nVertov belonged to a movement\ncalled the \u2018Kinoks\u2019 (from kino-oki,\nmeaning cinema-eyes),who rejected\nall forms of non-documentary\ncinema, in a form of proto-cin\u00e9ma\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9. For Vertov, the camera can\ndo anything, go anywhere. We are\nshown a plethora of human life,\nfrom a baby being born to a pulsing\nmetropolis, one built on an infinity\nof human lives, all stacked on top\nof each other at a frantic pace.\nVertov is not afraid to be radically\npolitical, and this city-symphony\nis also distinctly Marxist in tone,\nchampioning the Soviet march for\nprogress that defined the first half of\nthe USSR\u2019s existence.We are shown\na glittering world of technology,\nelectricity, and a glorification of\nlabour; despite having no voiceover (and, officially, no score at all),\nVertov manages to show us the\nprogress collective action can bring.\nWhile Vertov is rightly lauded, it\nis also crucial that we mention the\nwork of his wife, Yelizaveta Svilova,\nwho served as editor for the film,and\nwas responsible for helping to create\nthe pulsating rhythm that runs\nthroughout the work. Combining\ntogether nearly 2,000 shots, the film\nwas edited four times faster than\ncomparable films of the era,and this\nrapidity is still felt today, with Man\nwith a Movie Camera cannoning\nalong at a breakneck speed.\nThe film is a mission statement\nfor the powers and profound\npossibilities of the cinema. Vertov\nis a master with the camera work,\nand he is intent on showing us all\nthat it can do: jump-cuts, slow\nmotion, split screens, Dutch angles\n\u2013 Vertov has taken the entirety of\nthe director\u2019s lexicon and thrown it\nat the screen over a heart-stopping\n68 minutes. The frantic nature of a\nmodern city is made clear for us to\nsee, and \u2013 even now \u2013 in a shrinking\nworld awash with streamlined tech,\ninstantaneous messaging, and social\nmedia galore, Man with a Movie\nCamera still has the power to make\nthe viewer stop in their tracks. \u201cSo\nthis is the future,\u201d we cry, \u201cthis is\nthe brave new world we\u2019ve been\npromised\u201d. A clear example of what\ncinema is capable of, and a radical\ncall-to-arms for anyone to pick\nup their phone and start shooting,\nMan with a Movie Camera is an\nuplifting, unforgettable masterpiece\nof documentary cinema.\nA glittering glimpse into the modern interactions between man and machine. Photo Credit: BFI\nNeopolitan filmmaker Paolo\nSorrentino returns to our screens\nwith Youth, a mediation on love,\nlife, and aging. Although the setting\nof a Swiss hotel resort seems a\nworld away from the high-octane\nRome of his last film, Sorrentino\u2019s\nmonumental energy has been\npreserved. At the centre of the\npicture is Michael Caine\u2019s Fred\nBallinger, an aging composer who\ncomes yearly for relaxation; he is\njoined by a veritable menagerie\nof hotel residents, portrayed by a\nfantastic ensemble cast, including\nHervey Keitel, Paul Dano,\nRachel Weisz, and \u2013 in a hair-raising turn \u2013 Jane Fonda. By\nturns hilarious, offensive,\nand deeply moving, Youth\ncements Sorrentino\u2019s\nalready-stable status as a\nmaster of modern panEuropean cinema.\nReleased 29th\nJanuary\nA\nBigger\nSplash\nAnother Italian\nf i l m m a k e r\nworking in\nEnglish, this\ntime it is the\nturn of Luca\nGuagagnino to impress us.\nFollowing on from his 2009 hit I\nAm Love, A Bigger Splash sees him\nteaming up yet again with Tilda\nSwinton, who plays Marianne\nLane, an aging rock star who\nretreats to a secluded island for\nsome privacy. Once there, however,\nshe is unexpectedly joined by her\nold lover, Harry (Ralph Fiennes),\nand his daughter Penelope (Dakota\nJohnson). Inspired by Jacques\nDeray\u2019s La Piscine, A Bigger Splash\npromises to be a shimmering\nsexual mirage, perfect for lifting\nwinter blues. Ralph Fiennes is on\nparticularly good form in the film; it\nseems he is determined to blow away\nthe cobwebs from his previous,more\nsombre work, and A Bigger Splash\nmarks a continuation into comedy\nthat began with Wes Anderson\u2019s The\nGrand Budapest Hotel.\nReleased 12th\nFebruary\nHail, Caesar!\nThe return of American genre-flipping auteurs Joel and Ethan\nCoen, Hail, Caesar! revolves around\nthedisappearanceofBairdWhitlock\n(George Clooney), an actor of\nHollywood\u2019s Golden Age, in the\nCary Grant mould. What follows\nis a comedy caper, as fixer Eddie\nMannix (Josh Brolin) is tasked\nwith finding the leading man, and\nkeeping the news out of the gossip\nrags.

A deeply moving\nanimated exploration of loneliness\nand isolation, Anomalisa is a far cry\nfrom other animated films, with\nits unflinching examination of the\nnature of life.The unique animation\nstyle, which can be off-putting, is\nsure to cement it in the canon of\nanimated cinema, and Anomalisa\nis sure to be one to watch for this\nyear\u2019s Academy Awards. It also is\none of the film marking the return of\nJennifer Jason Leigh to our screens,\nalong with Quentin Tarantino\u2019s The\nHateful Eight \u2013 a dearly-missed\npresence from cinema, it is a delight\nto welcome her back.\nReleased 11th\nMarch\nThe cast of Luca Guagagnino\u2019s A Bigger Splash.

Photo Credit: FELIX\nO\nnTuesday,juniordoctors\nwent on strike for 24\nhours, in protest against\nthe government\u2019s\nproposed changes to their contracts.\nDoctors say these changes will\ninvolve both dangerously long\nworking hours for them, which will\nin turn endanger patients, as well as\nan effective pay cut.\nPeaceful picket lines were set\nup from 8:30am outside Chelsea\nand Westminster, Charing\nCross, Hammersmith and St.\nMary\u2019s hospitals, as well as others\nthroughout the country. Striking\ndoctors wrapped up at around 4pm.\nJunior doctors also gathered\noutside South Kensington,\nPaddington and Hammersmith\nstations, joined by students, who\nhanded out flyers, stickers and\nspoke to members of the public on\nthe issue.\nThe picketers themselves wore\narmbands and fluorescent jackets,\nissued to them by the BMA.\nMedical students were not allowed\nto join the official picket lines, but\ndid aid doctors in spreading the\nword.\nUp to one in ten operations were\ncancelled, although 10,000 of the\nestimated 26,000 went into work\non Tuesday, according to the BBC,\npartly because doctors on emergency\ncare were not striking.\nThe strike comes after contract\nnegotiations between NHS\nEngland and the British Medical\nAssociation (BMA) once again\nbroke down, having re-started in\nDecember after the last strike was\ncancelled.This was the first of three\nplanned strike days, with another\nemergency care only strike lasting\nfor 48 hours planned for the 28th\nof January, and a full day walk-out\npenned for the 10th\nof February.\nAcas, the professional body that\nhas been mediating the talks, said\non Wednesday that negotiations\nwould start again yesterday and\ncontinue today. After protests back\nin October, junior members of the\nBMA were balloted as to whether to\ntake industrial action. 98% voted for\na full strike. However, the industrial\naction then planned for three dates\nin December was suspended after\ncontract negotiations with the\ngovernment were restarted.\nAn agreement could not be\nreached within the allotted time, so\nat the start of this year the BMA\nannounced renewed plans for strike\naction.\nJunior doctors aren\u2019t necessarily\nfresh from medical school. The title\n\u2018junior\u2019 includes any doctor who has\nfinished medical school but is not\nyet a consultant.The BBC estimates\nthat almost a third of England\u2019s\nmedical workforce are junior\ndoctors.The dispute is only affecting\ndoctors working in England, as the\ncontracts in Wales and Scotland\nwon\u2019t be changing, with Northern\nIreland is yet to decide.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nJunior\ndoctors\naren\u2019t\nnecessarily\nfresh from\nmedical\nschool\nAs someone who will be directly\naffected by the junior contract\nchange, and someone whose\npartner is already being ravaged by\na career in the NHS, I could flood\nFELIX with personal stories and\nstories from friends as to why this\nweek\u2019s industrial action was\nnecessary. Instead I\nwant to talk about\nthe impact on\nI m p e r i a l \u2019 s\n2000 medical\ns t u d e n t s .\nAlthough we\nknew we were\nin for a tough\nride when\nwe applied to\nmedical school, we\ndid not sign up a life\nalmost completely devoid\nof evenings and weekends \u2013 a life\nwithout friends, family or home\nlife.Contrary to Government spin,\nwe are not in medicine for money;\nthe additional costs of professional\ninsurance and exams make our\n\u00a323,000 starting salary pretty\nmeagre. As medical students we\ncannot officially strike, nor are\nwe eligible to vote on industrial\naction,despite having just as much\nof a stake as any qualified doctor.\nThis week Union Council voted to\nsupport junior doctors. Not only\ndo the proposed changes\npose a massive threat\nto the future\nwellbeing of\nall medical\nstudents, but\nthe threat of a\nmass exodus\nof doctors\nmay also risk\nthe quality\nof teaching we\ncan receive on the\nwards. I trust that\nyou, the extraordinarily\nintelligent and well educated\nstudents of Imperial, are able to\nsee though Government spin, and\nwill stand alongside us.

It was a planned strike\nby the British Medical Association\n(BMA) after talks between junior\ndoctors and the government broke\ndown.\nThe last few months have\nbeen fraught with political spin\nsurrounding the new junior doctor\ncontract. The dangerous message\nthat the government is sending to\nthe public boils down to the idea that\nit will provide a seven day service\nand that the contract gives doctors\nan 11% pay rise. The reality is very\ndifferent. Firstly, the NHS already\nruns a seven day service. Should you\nhave a stroke or heart attack or any\nother emergency,A&E departments\nare open all year around 24/7, not\nsimply manned by a cleaner (thank\nyou, Russell Howard). Opening a\nseven day service that includes non-emergency care, such as clinics and\nnon-emergency surgeries would\nrequire a huge amount of money\nto become reality. This is simply\nnot possible when the NHS has\nbeen asked to make budget savings\nof \u00a322bn by 2020, despite an\nincreasing demand for healthcare\nservices. To put it simply, where is\nthe money going to come from to\ndeliver this dream seven day elective\nservice whilst making budget cuts?\nIt is a question that Dr Mark Porter,\nchair of the BMA, along with many\ndoctors, has been asking. And the\nanswer seems to be an elusive one.\nSecondly, the government is\npushing the idea that doctors have\nbeen offered an 11% pay rise. To\nthe misinformed public, this makes\ndoctors seem like awful people. An\n11% pay rise and they are striking?\nThe thing is, doctors didn\u2019t ask for a\npay rise at any point in this process.\nI think that maybe they should have,\nconsidering the amount of training\nrequired and the highly stressful\nnature of their jobs. In any case,\nthey haven\u2019t. Doctors do not live\n\u2018the high life\u2019, as the Sun seems to\nwant us to believe, branding doctors\n\u201cChampagne socialists\u201d. A first year\njunior doctor starts with an annual\nsalary of below \u00a323,000, after a\nminimum of five years at university\nand all the debt that comes with it.\nAlthough the new contract will lead\nto an 11% increase in basic pay, the\nmajority of doctors will see a pay\ncut.This is because the new contract\nredefines the \u2018sociable hours\u2019 to\ninclude larger parts of the day, up to\n10pm on weekdays and Saturdays.\nAs a result, the remuneration\ndoctors currently receive for\nworking long shifts, night shifts,\nand weekends dissipates. This will\nparticularly affect doctors who work\nin emergency care.\nUnlike the strike on the 10th\nDecember, this one was not\ncancelled in the eleventh hour. The\nstrike went ahead this Tuesday and\ndoctors nationwide took to picket\nlines outside hospitals. Medical\nstudents from ICSM were also\nthere in support, giving out leaflets\nto the public. Everyone could be\nseen and heard chanting. But where\nwas Jeremy Hunt? No one could\nfind him.On a momentous occasion\nsuch as this, the first doctors\nstrike since the 1970s, the health\nsecretary had done a Houdini.\nHis representative, Dr Norman\nWilliams, was reluctant (or unable)\nto answer questions by reporters.\nJeremy Hunt was found at his home,\nbut escaped any questions on junior\ndoctors by jumping in his car. He\ndid end up giving an interview of the\nsame rhetoric, deeming the 24 hour\nstrikes \u201ccompletely unnecessary\u201d,\nand urging doctors to return to the\nnegotiation table. Of course, the\ngovernment will never say anything\napart from that. They are hardly\nlikely to turn around and say that\nthey fully support the BMA strike.\nThis dispute has been going on for\nyears and has failed to be resolved.\nJeremy Hunt\u2019s ambition to force\nthe new contract through, which\nis unfair for doctors and will be\nunsafe for patients in the long term,\nhas seen the medical profession\nlose any faith in him as Health\nSecretary. Something needs to be\ndone. Doctors do not want to strike,\nand they do not want a pay rise (but\nneither do they want a cut).They are\nstriking to make sure that the public\nrealises the danger the NHS is in\nat the hands of this Conservative\ngovernment. Down the line, when\nthere are not enough doctors to meet\nneeds because they have been put\noff by the contract, and when those\nwho remain are tired, overworked\nand underappreciated, it is patients\nwho will feel the effects. There is a\nrisk that the public will then lose\nfaith in the NHS as a service, as\nit becomes stretched even beyond\nits current limits. This will allow\npoliticians to stand up and say that\nthe only solution is the introduction\nof privatisation, which is something\nthat none of us here in the UK\nshould want.\nThe proposed junior doctor contracts will put off the next generation from becoming\ndoctors\nI don\u2019t want no scrub.

We hope you\u2019ve had a good break over Christmas (and for those of you with\nexams, that they went well/will go well \u2013 we\u2019re crossing our fingers for you) and are all ready to take on the\nart world this term. It looks to be a great term for art, and we\u2019ve put together a really long list of our picks for\ntheatre, visual art exhibitions, opera and other artsy events happening in the next few months. Do get exploring\n\u2013 most of these events and shows have student tickets that you can take advantage of. Get in touch with us if\nyou want to write a review for anything at all, or even better, we love comment pieces. Yes, we want your views\non any art-related issue or topic. As always, we\u2019d also love your creative pieces, and you should also get to work\nwith anything you\u2019d like to see in our magazine of creative works, Phoenix, at the end of this term.\nOde to an encyclopedia\nO hefty hardcover on the built-in shelf in my parents\u2019 living\nroom,\nO authority stamped on linen paper, molted from your dust\njacket ,\nQuesting Beast of blue and gold, you were my companion\non beige afternoons that came slanting through the curtains\nbehind the rough upholstered chair. You knew how to trim a\nsail\nand how the hornet builds a hive. You had a topographical map\nof the mountain ranges on the far side of the moon\nand could name the man who shot down the man\nwho murdered Jesse James. At forty, I tell myself\nthat boyhood was all enchantment: hanging around the railway,\ngetting plastered on cartoons; I see my best friend\u2019s father\nmarinating in a lawn chair, smiling benignly at his son and me\nfrom above a gin and tonic, or sitting astride his roof\nwith carpentry nails and hammer, going at some problem\nthat kept resisting all his mending. O my tome, my paper\nbrother,\nmy narrative without an ending, you had a diagram of a cow\nbroken down into the major cuts of beef, and an image\nof the Trevi Fountain. The boarding house,\nthe church on the corner: all that stuff is gone.\nIn winter in Toronto, people say, a man goes outside\nand shovels snow mostly so that his neighbors know\njust how much snow he is displacing. I\u2019m writing this\nin Baltimore. For such a long time, the boy wants\nto grow up and be at large, but posture becomes bearing;\nbearing becomes shape.

We saw the release of\nthe first volume of Bitch Planet, a\ncomic applauded for its feminist\nthemes. And Ms. Marvel starring\nKamala Khan, Marvel\u2019s first titular\nmuslim superhero, saw continued\ncritical and commercial success.\n2016 looks set to continue this trend\nwhilst also expanding diversity in\ncomics, beyond the characters in\nthe pages, to those who write and\nillustrate the stories themselves.The\nseries that I\u2019m looking forward to\nthis year, whether completely new\nor continuing, don\u2019t always fit this\nrequirement; some of 2016\u2019s most\npromising titles come from industry\nveterans. Here are my top picks. If\nyou want to hear more of my views\non comics tune in to my show on\nIC Radio on Sunday 24th\nJanuary\nwhere I will be joined by the FELIX\nEditor, Grace!\nFaith\nValiant Comics\u2019 miniseries Faith,\nwritten by Jody Houser, stars a\nfemale superheroine (who just\nhappens to be plus-size) with the\npower of flight and telekinesis. But\nFaith isn\u2019t just defined by the shape\nor size of her body, she\u2019s a massive\nfangirl, quoting her favourite TV\nseries and comics.\nIt\u2019s a book that\u2019s aimed squarely\nat the audience that has brought\nMs. Marvel such massive success,\ngroundedinrealitywithaprotagonist\nthat\u2019s somewhat relatable. The art\nfrom previews showcases Francis\nPortela and Marguerite Sauvage\u2019s\nbeautifully detailed environments\nand interiors, however, it\u2019s Faith and\nher superheroine alter-ego Zephyr\u2019s\ncharacter and costume design that is\nmost daring.\nPaper Girls\nIt seems as if writer Brian K.\nVaughan can do no wrong (if you\nhaven\u2019t read Saga yet,go and read the\nfirst five volumes now). Paper Girls,\nhis collaboration with artist Cliff\nChiang and colourist Matt Wilson,\nstarted last year,but it\u2019s set to be one\nof the year\u2019s best continuing series.\nIt\u2019s a science-fiction story\nfollowing four paper delivery girls\nwith influences ranging from The\nWar of the Worlds to eighties\nAmerican adventure films like\nThe Goonies. It\u2019s also one of the\nbest looking comics in years, with\nCliff Chiang\u2019s sketchy lines and\ncartoonish faces complemented\nperfectly by Matt Wilson\u2019s gorgeous\ncolours, which rotate between the\npinks and yellows of a sunset to\ngreyish blues.\nMoon Knight\nEver since I read Jeff Lemire\u2019s\nmassively underappreciated\nAnimal Man, I\u2019ve been a huge fan\nof his work. He\u2019s writing two new\nseries for Marvel in 2016: Moon\nKnight and Old Man Logan. The\nfirst explores the mental health\nof institutionalised Marc Spector.\nGreg Smallwood on art (who\nworked on the last volume of Moon\nKnight) shines in black and white,\nwith a raw, sketchy, and almost\nphoto-realistic style.\nThe second tells the story of an\nolder, retired Wolverine in the all-new Marvel universe. The series\nstarted last year with a five issue run\nand starts anew (with another issue\none) this year with the same creative\nteam. Long-time collaborator\nAndrea Sorrentino gives power\nto Lemire\u2019s words with gritty\njagged lines, inventive layouts and\nspectacular comic sound effects.\nBlack Panther\nRecently, Marvel have made\nan effort to promote minorities\nin new series or as replacements\nfor their most popular characters.\nUnfortunately, the writers remain\nwhite. Black Panther marks TaNehisi Coates\u2019, a prominent\nAmerican journalist, first\nintroduction to comics. Writing\nabout race and the politics that\nsurround it, Ta-Nehisi received\nacclaim last year for his work at The\nAtlantic. Hiring him was a smart\nmove by Marvel and is good news\nfor an industry that is in dire need\nof more Black writers. Expect this\nto be one of the year\u2019s most highly\nrated titles.\nSnotgirl\nBryan Lee O\u2019malley of Scott\nPilgrim returns in 2016 with\nSnotgirl. It\u2019s a dark comedy about\na fashion blogger with some serious\nallergies focused on the theme of\ncreating and maintaining an online\nimage; a comic for the internet\nage. Artist Leslie Hung describes\nit as \u201ckind of like Sex and the City\nmeets American Psycho,\u201d which is\nsurely a reason to get excited. While\nrelatively unknown, Hung\u2019s use of\nwatercolours might result in some\nof the year\u2019s best comic art.\nHeartless\nWarren Ellis and Tula Lotay are\nteaming up again (having previously\ncollaborated on Supreme: Blue\nRose) for Heartless - a comic about\na female musician from Northern\nEngland who returns home to write\nher latest album only to be haunted\nby her past and a mysterious young\ngirl (featured on the cover).\nLotay\u2019s otherworldly art seems a\nperfect match for the horror genre\nand expectations are high after\nshe won numerous awards as a\nguest artist for a single issue of The\nWicked & The Divine. Heartless\nlooks like it will be another solid\ntitle in Image Comics\u2019 diverse 2016\nlineup.\nBored? Go to the theatre!\nMax\u2019s Guide to Theatre 2016\nAnd so the New Year has arrived and we can look forward to another year of fantastically underfunded,undervalued\ntheatre.While I\u2019d hoped my suggestions would be mildly original, they aren\u2019t really - these are the must see shows\nI had to include. I\u2019ve focussed on the larger theatres as a (semi) guarantee for quality, but that is not to say that\nLondon\u2019s smaller venues don\u2019t offer something special. Whatever you see, be it big or small, as long as it\u2019s not at\nthe West End I\u2019ll be happy.\nThe Caretaker (The Old Vic, 26 March \u2013 14 May)\nThe benchmark for modern theatre, Harold Pinter\u2019s masterpiece revolutionised the stage at its premier in 1960.\nWhile I\u2019m not an ardent fan of the Old Vic,Timothy Spall\u2019s casting gives me butterflies. A classic British actor, I\nanticipate a performance of the highest quality. Of course, like with Cumberbatch\u2019s Hamlet, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked\nif the production is so overdone that the result is stale and disappointing. However, my faith in Spall is great and if\nthere is any celebrity performance to watch out for, it\u2019s this.Tickets from \u00a312\nA Girl is a Half Formed Thing (The Young Vic, 17 February - 26 March)\nFor a long time I thought the Young Vic could do no wrong. With incredible production after incredible production\nI was generally of the opinion that the Young Vic is the best major(ish) theatre in London. After the calamity of\nMacbeth over Christmas I\u2019m not so sure, but with this production I know what we\u2019re getting. With across the board\npraise at its premier in Dublin, this fearless adaptation of Eimear McBride\u2019s novel promises a powerful boundary\npushing production which will amaze those brave enough to take it on.\nUncle Vanya (The Almeida, 5 February - 26 March)\nTo my great embarrassment I\u2019ve neglected The Almeida for much of my theatre life. Being far away in North\nLondon, I\u2019ve somehow always avoided it, but after a number of impressive seasons, Uncle Vanya is my chance\nto properly appreciate this exciting modern theatre. Directed by Robert Icke, winner of the 2015 the Evening\nStandard\u2019s Best Director award, Chekhov\u2019s late masterpiece offers an unrivalled script to a talented, interesting cast.\nWhile I don\u2019t have much to go on, on this occasion I\u2019m just going to say trust me.\nA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (The Globe, 30 April - 11 September)\nI\u2019m not a particular fan of The Globe or A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, but a new artistic director is always a\nmajor event at London\u2019s top theatres. Emma Rice, the former artistic director of Kneehigh Theatre, takes over from\nDominic Dromgoole. Rice\u2019s first production promises a riotous celebration full of naughtiness. What that entails I\ndon\u2019t know, but Kneehigh\u2019s reputation as a stellar experimental company suggests good things. About Rice herself I\ndon\u2019t know much, but her bold history gives reasons to be optimistic.\nThe Suicide (The National Theatre, 6 April - 21 May)\nI guess I\u2019ve picked Nikolai Erdman\u2019s satirical classic The Suicide more out of gut feeling than anything else. With\nfunding falling, the National has built a reputation for playing it safe. Despite some stellar productions, their output\nhasn\u2019t always reached the standard that you might expect from the principle British theatre.That said, the prospect\nof this production excites me. It looks gritty, current, fresh and funny. With the last adaptation in 2007 by Moira\nBuffini showing great promise, I have hope for this production.\n\n"

TfL added over 200 buses on\nthe busiest routes for the last strike\nand are expected to do the same this\ntime around,but commuters coming\nfrom further afield such as from the\nnew student accommodation in\nNorth Acton, Woodward, are likely\nto face travel times approaching 90\nminutes, almost double the current\nnorm.\nMATT JOHNSTON\nCrick wants cash\nImperial\u2019s latest investment, The Francis Crick Institute, has asked for more\nmoney from college\nR\necently published\nminutes from a college\ncouncil meeting in\nSeptember have revealed\nthat Imperial has been asked to\ncontribute an extra \u00a31million per\nyear to the new Francis Crick\nInstitute, on top of their initial\n\u00a340million investment.\nHowever, the minutes also seem\nto show that college was hesitent to\nstump up the money, no questions\nasked.\n\u201cIt was suggested that the\nCollege should not agree to make\nan additional contribution to the\nInstitute\u2019s running costs without\na commitment from the Crick\nthat these would be brought under\ncontrol and that the Institute would\nbecome financially sustainable\u201d the\nminutes say.\nThe new biomedical institute is a\nconsortium funded by the Medical\nResearch Council, Cancer Research\nand the Wellcome Trust, as well as\nKing\u2019s, UCL, and Imperial.\nAll three contributing higher\neducation institutes have been\nasked to stump up extra cash.

Photo Credit: AMC\nThe cast of War and Peace in their stunningly designed costumes. Photo Credit: BBC\nT\nhe new year is not only\na time for resolutions\nand working towards a\nnew direction, it is also\na time for a slew of new TV shows\nto premiere and (hopefully) become\nthe next thing to look forward to\neach week. So without further ado,\nhere is a list of my recommendations\nof new shows to watch in 2016. Just\nrememberthisisasubjectiveopinion\nand there could a large number of\nupcoming awesome shows I haven\u2019t\nmentioned.Regardless,there should\nbe something for you to enjoy.\nWar and Peace by Leo Tolstoy,\none of the longest novels ever\nwritten, would be considered very\ndifficult to adapt into a six part\nseries for a Sunday night slot. With\nhundreds of characters, intervening\nand complex story lines as well\nissues like religion, death, love and\nsex, writer Andrew Davies clearly\nenjoys a challenge. A couple of\nepisodes in however, it is clear\nDavies has created an adaptation\nthat\u2019s both lavish, breathtaking and\nintriguing. It also helps to have a\ncast, with the likes of Paul Dano\nand Lily James, that are able to give\nsolid performances.\nThe Crown, Netflix\u2019s first U.K.\nbased original series, stars Doctor\nWho\u2019s Matt Smith and Wolf Hall\u2019s\nClaire Foy in a 10-part story about\nthe royal family, inspired by Peter\nMorgan\u2019s theatre production \u2018The\nAudience\u2019. The show, featuring\nthe two important locations\nof Buckingham Palace and 10\nDowning Street, will be about the\nevents that shaped the latter half\nof the 20th\ncentury as well as the\nintrigues, love lives and plans that\nwent on behind the scenes. It will\nbe an interesting look into the\nroyal family as well as the state of a\nchanging world.\nLegend\u2019s of Tomorrow, a spin-off\nshow from CW\u2019s \u2018Arrow and Flash\u2019,\nfeatures a team of C-list heroes and\nvillains travelling through time to\nprevent a future disaster. Featuring\npreviously established characters\nas well as Arthur Darvill as time\ntravelling Rip Hunter, the show\nlooks to be an intriguing take on the\nusual superhero adventures. With\nshowrunner Greg Berlanti having\nalready proven his talents on \u2018Arrow\u2019\nand \u2018Flash\u2019, it is hopeful this show\nwill be able to deliver on the build\nup and hype leading towards it.\nLucifer the devil, bored and\nunhappy from his duties, retires\nand takes up residence in Los\nAngeles. Played by Tom Ellis, the\ntitle character will spend his time\nmanaging a nightclub and helping\nthe LAPD punish criminals and\nsolve crimes. A grounded take on\nLucifer, the show will be about his\nlife on Earth injected with dark\nhumour. A loose adaption of the\ncharacter written by Neil Gaiman,\nthis should be one not to miss.\nShadowhunters are what you\nget when you mix a human with\nangel blood. Based on Cassandra\nClare\u2019s fantasy novel series, \u2018The\nMortal Instruments\u2019, the new\nFreeform (formerly ABC Family)\nseries follows a core group of the\nparanormal beings, played by\nKatherine McNamara, Emeraude\nToubia, and Dominic Sherwood,\ntrying to protect innocent civilians\nfrom evil demons. While the series\npreviously had a lacklustre movie\ngo-around, this TV debut might be\nable to revitalise the characters in\nlive action.\nThe X-Files isn\u2019t technically a new\nshow, but it has been absent from\nTV for so long that I\u2019m letting it\nslide. Fox are bringing back Mulder\nand Scully, with David Duchovny\nand Gillian Anderson reprising\ntheir iconic roles, for a limited run\nof six episodes starting in January.\nIt\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a lot of hype\nand expectation around this one,\ngiving the fact that it\u2019s been 13 years\nsince our last supernatural case, and\nthe promise of new cast members\nincluding the likes of Joel McHale.\nPreacher is a show that will\nhave the weird fantasy and bizarre\nplots that will appeal to many. It\u2019s\nanother adaptation, this time of the\ncomic book series by Garth Ennis\nand Steve Dillon, produced by\nSeth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and\nSam Catlin. Conflicted preacher\nJesse Custer, played by the MCU\u2019s\nDominic Cooper, is inhabited by\na strange entity which gives him\nweird powers and he must go on a\nmission to literally, find God. Don\u2019t\nlet the religious underlines stop you,\nas the comic book was notable for\nbeing aggressively dark and violent.\nAlso starring Agents of SHIELD\u2019s\nRuth Negga and Misfits\u2019 Joseph\nGilgun, it is sure to be a wild, fun\nand crazy ride.\nWestworld has a lot of good\nthings about it to get you hyped, not\njust that fact that its on HBO. It\u2019s\nbeing created by The Dark Knight\nand Interstellar\u2019s Jonathan Nolan.\nIt is based on the 1973 film of the\nsame name, written and directed by\nJurassic Park\u2019s Michael Crichton.\nIt also features an impressive cast\nwith the likes of Anthony Hopkins,\nJames Marsden and Evan Rachel\nWoods among others. The story\nis centred around a futuristic\namusement park where the park\nandroids begin to malfunction and\nstart to kill people, in other words,\nan awesome adventure.\nThese shows will be available on\nNetflix and Amazon Prime\nThe two sleuths with an 18th\ncentury style.

It took a new\ninteresting direction to previous\nepisodes; the long and short of it\nis that while the setting was nice,\nthe performances solid and the\njokes decent, the story got a bit too\nconvoluted and honestly, too silly at\ntimes. Spoilers ahead.\nSteven Moffat and Mark Gatiss\u2019\nSherlock was unique for having\na modern day spin on the classic\nArthur Conan Doyle stories so\nit was an interesting touch to go\nback to Victorian London where it\nall started. The episode starts as an\nalmost soft reboot, reintroducing\nthe characters and getting back into\nthe game in an old-age setting. The\ncontemporary backdrop does lead\nto more faithful adaptations of the\noriginal stories with the example of\nWatson writing for the Strand as\nopposed to blogging.\nSoon we came to the attention\nof the \u201cAbominable bride\u201d, the\ncase which would push Holmes\nto \u201cmental and physical extremes\u201d.\nHowever, the case took a while, as\nwell as some exposition,to get going\nand when it did, those extremes\nCumberbatch and Martin Freeman\nboth deliver solid performances,\ndisplaying great chemistry between\nthe two characters once again.\nIf it focused entirely on the\nVictorian setting as an independent\ntale, this episode, as well as the case\nresolution, could have been much\ngreater. While not abominable, it\nwasn\u2019t the best we\u2019ve seen Sherlock\nbe and we hope season four regains\nthe light of the previous episodes.\nSherlock is available on Netflix\nthe episode is not without some\nmerits. We do get to see Andrew\nScott return as the character and it\nis always entertaining to see Holmes\nand Moriarty face off against each\nother, especially seeing them go\ntoe-to-toe at the Reichenbach falls.\nThe insights into Sherlock\u2019s drug\naddictions, while a little out of\nplace, were sufficiently informative\nand sad and the appearances of the\nbride were also genuinely creepy and\nterrifying. Unsurprisingly, Benedict\nAnurag Deshpande\nWriter\nT\nhe most recent series\nof Doctor Who has\nbeen, by and large, fairly\nwell received. Despite\nfollowing a somewhat weak season\nfinale, the latest offering continues\nthe positive trend. This year for\nChristmas, showrunner Stephen\nMoffat decided to give the viewers\nthat most elusive of gifts; a good\nRiver Song centred episode.\nAlthough the story the episode\ntells may be simple, the execution\nis extremely well done. We are\ntreated to a classic heist narrative,\nas the Doctor ends up accidentally\nembroiled in a plot to steal the\nhead of an intergalactic warlord,\nHydroflax; played by an aptly cast\nyet criminally underused Greg\nDavies.\nIn fact, the entire main cast\nshines here. Peter Capaldi and\nAlex Kingston have exceptional\nchemistry together; far better than\nKingston had with either of her\nprevious Doctors. Their playful\nbanter and interactions are the main\ndriving force of the episode,and help\nelevate what otherwise could have\nbeen a forgettable instalment. Little\nBritain\u2019s Matt Lucas also puts in an\nappearance; delivering a perfectly\nserviceable, if somewhat pointless,\nperformance. Assisting the leading\nduo\u2019s dynamic is the tight pacing\nof the episode. Momentum is\nmaintained throughout, and the\nwriting manages to expertly walk\nthe tight rope between keeping\nthe audience interested and feeling\nrushed.\nThis,seemingly,being River Song\u2019s\nfinal appearance, Moffat chooses\nto reverse the dynamic of her first.\nThis is Song\u2019s first meeting with\nthis incarnation of the Doctor, and\nas such she does not recognise him.\nAdmittedly, this does not serve any\nparticularly sophisticated purpose,\nother than, perhaps, to cause the\nviewer to smirk upon realisation.\nDespite not being directly linked,\nthis episode also provides a fitting\nend to the arc of the Doctor over\nthe previous season; with him finally\naccepting that there are some things\neven he cannot change.If this seems\nfamiliar, it is because it is an arc that\nthe show has, arguably, done to\nthe death. For me, at least, this is a\nforgivable issue; since it is relatively\nwell done, and one can hardly fault\na show that has been around for\n60 years for repeating plot points\nat times. Stringent continuity buffs\nwill at least be happy with the fact\nthat all the remaining plot threads\nwith Song are tied up here.\nWith the exception of, well, the\nexceptional episodes, I\u2019ve generally\nbeen ambivalent to River Song.\nHowever, I understand the dislike\nfor her character and her perceived\noveruse. Perhaps if the writing\nhad been this strong in her other\nappearances, she would be a fond\nmemory in the annuals of Who\nhistory. Regardless, we\u2019ll always\nhave \u2018Silence in the Library\u2019.\nDoctor Who is available on iPlayer\nJust another Christmas Adventure with your spouse.

A\nbig reason for that is the reveal that\nthis episode isn\u2019t a fun standalone\npiece but rather a scenario playing\nin modern day Sherlock\u2019s head as a\nmeans to work out how Moriarty\nis back from the dead. It was an\ninteresting idea but the multiple\ntime jumps, twists and blurred lines\nbetween fantasy and reality led to\na confusing and ultimately lacking\nthird act.

    "content": "PAGE 27\nfelixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 15th\nJANUARY 2016\nWELFARE felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nt\u2019s the start of a new year, and\na new term. With this comes a\ngreat deal of opportunity, and\nalso pressure \u2013 not least exams,\ncoursework and deadlines. When\nyou\u2019re feeling stressed and pressured,\nor if you experience anxiety or\ndepression or low self-esteem,or any\nchronic illness,all these tasks you set\nyourself can get overwhelming; the\nthings you set yourself to improve\non end up making things feel worse.\nInstead of making a whole bunch\nof New Years Resolutions that will\nput you under yet more pressure and\nmake you feel bad for quitting, here\nare a few ideas to take into account.\nResolution 1: Let\nyourself have off days\nWhether you have depression, or\nare just having a bad day, remember\nthat it is ok to have days where\nyou aren\u2019t 100%. Sometimes, you\nneed to just take a step back, spend\nsome quality time with Netflix\nand recover your energy. If you let\nyourself relax, the next day will feel\nat least a little more manageable\n\u2013 at least it does for me.\nResolution 2: Remember\nto practise self-care\nSelf-care comes in many forms:\nremembering to have regular healthy\nmeals; doing that laundry pile;\nmaking yourself some hot chocolate\nand curling up with a book. All of\nthese things do tend to take a little\nbit of effort, but the little effort in\ngives you a huge gain in mind-set.It\nhelpsmaintainmotivationandkeeps\nyou from getting burned out, which\nis all too easy, especially for students\nat Imperial; we have a tendency\nto work ourselves quite hard!\nResolution 3: Take up a\nnew hobby\nAlright, so this one is a classic,\nbut there is a reason it is always\ncited as a good resolution to make.\nTrying something new can help to\nexpand both your social circle and\nyour horizons \u2013 not to mention you\ncan at least say you tried something\nnew this year! Just having a go and\nbeing an amateur at something can\nbe oddly freeing, and who knows,\nyou might discover a new passion.\nResolution 4: Form a\nnew study group\nThis one may seem a bit odd, but\nI find that if you work with other\npeople, or at least around them, it\nhas several benefits.Firstly,you tend\nto be more productive, because you\ncan keep each other going.Secondly,\nthere is always someone to ask if\nyou get stuck on a problem. And\nfinally, it means you can\u2019t skip out\non studying because there are other\npeople waiting for you. It turns\nstudying into both an obligation and\na social activity, which I find can be\nvery useful on those days when you\njust want to go home and chill.\nResolution 5: Break up\nlarge tasks into smaller\nchunks\nThis is something we\u2019re always\ntold, but for some reason I at least\nused to constantly ignore it. But\nthis good old piece of advice is\ngenuinely helpful, especially if\nyou\u2019re feeling overwhelmed for\nany reason. Breaking down your\ncoursework into smaller chunks\nlets you make a plan of how to do\nthe task more easily, and gives you\na series of smaller achievements to\nNew Year\u2019s resolutions for\noverall wellbeing in 2016\nkeep you motivated as you work.\nResolution 6: Be kind to\nyourself\nIf you choose to take up only\none of these resolutions, I would\nsay this should be the one you\nchoose.There is a somewhat famous\nphrase: \u2018treat others as you would\nyourself\u2019. Personally, I don\u2019t find\nit that helpful; all too often I put\nso much pressure on myself and\ntell myself I am lazy or useless at\nwhatever it is I\u2019m trying to do.\nIf I were to treat others how I\ntreat myself, I don\u2019t think I would\nhave many friends left \u2013 and this\nis often the case for many of us.\nThere is one rule for our friends\nand family, and a whole other, often\nunattainable and perfectionistic\nstandard, for ourselves. So instead\nof the usual phrasing, I\u2019ll put it the\nother way around. Treat yourself\nlike you would treat your friends,\nor a younger sibling. Look after\nyourself, let yourself make mistakes\nand don\u2019t beat yourself up about\nthem. And be kind to yourself.\nHappy New Year.\nCelebrate the New Year with self-care, socialising and maybe even a new hobby!.

    "content": "I\nnnovation, reinvention and\nfreedom of expression are just\na few of the terms that could be\nused to describe the expansive\nvariety of the artistry of David\nBowie. Over the past five decades\nBowie has been a constant driving\nforce in modern music; his ever\nchanging style and personality has\nhad a lasting impact and influence\non popular culture. His songs were\nconstantly accessible by a huge fan\nbase, whatever the style of music\nhe explored, resulting in one of the\nlargest and most musically diverse\ncults in the world. Not only did\nBowie experiment with music,\nbut he also explored other forms\nof creative expression including\nfashion, performance art and film.\nBowie\u2019s chameleonic nature \u2013\nwhich he claimed to be due to\nrestlessness and boredom \u2013 made\nhim one of the most unique and\nloved pop stars ever. An enigmatic\nsex icon challenging society\u2019s\nboundaries of personal freedom and\nexpression. Through all of the stage\npersonas that Bowie adopted, Ziggy\nStardust, Aladdin Sane, The Thin\nWhite Duke and Major Tom, the\nman behind the mask remained ever\na legend, an inspiration and a hero.\nBorn in Brixton on the 8th\nJanuary\n1947 as David Robert Jones, early\ntalents in interpretive dance showed\na promising future for Bowie in\nthe creative arts. After listening\nto some of his father\u2019s American\nrock\u2019n\u2019roll collection he was quickly\ninspired to join a skiffle group and\ntake up the plastic alto saxophone\nin 1961. Still in education he went\non to study art, music and design\nwhere a scuffle with a friend led to\nhis permanently dilated pupil that\ngave him the appearance of having\ndifferent coloured eyes. At the age\nof 15 his ever-changing personality\nsaw him shift between numerous\nbands before deciding to take a solo\ndeal in 1967 under the name of\nDavid Bowie.\nBowie\u2019s early singles and first\nalbum did not have much success\nand it was not until his 1969 single\n\u2018Space Oddity\u2019, coinciding with the\nApollo 11 mission, that he tasted\nsuccess as the single reached the top\nfive in the UK charts. After being\nimmersed in London\u2019s bohemian\nart scene his sound quickly shifted\nto a darker place and he released\nrock albums The Man Who Stole\nThe World (1970) and Hunky Dory\n(1971). It was in 1971 when Bowie\nwalked to Glastonbury and played\nat the free festival with an acoustic\nguitar at 4am as the sun came up.At\nthis point he was still little known\nwithin the industry and it was not\nuntil his fifth studio album that he\nwould reach worldwide fame.\nIn 1972, from erratic images and\nideas, Bowie created the alien-like\nrock god Ziggy Stardust, the\nprotagonist of his fifth album The\nRise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust\nAnd The Spiders From Mars. Ziggy\nbecame a huge otherworldly\ncharacter, onstage and off stage,\ndrawing in a cult of glam rockers.\nBut, as the album title suggests,\nBowie killed off the character\nonstage at the end of his tour at the\nHammersmith Odeon.\nIn the mid 70s Bowie moved to\nLos Angeles, where he branched\nout, bringing to life the character\nof Aladdin Sane, cementing his\nreputation in America with his\nfirst US number one single \u2018Fame\u2019.\nContinuing to reinvent his music\nand glam personas, he brought out\nthe albums Aladdin Sane (1973)\nand the dystopian Diamond Dogs\n(1974). Then in true Bowie style\nhe diverted his attention to plastic\nsoul with albums Young Americans\n(1975) and StationTo Station (1976)\nin which his monochrome persona\nThe Thin White Duke brought\nneo Nazi controversy to an already\ncontroversial pop star. During his\ntime in LA Bowie spiralled into\na cocaine addiction causing him\nto develop anti-social habits as a\nvirtual recluse.\nEfforts to explore and experiment\nwith more mediums of music,\nas well as to kick off his cocaine\naddiction, led him to West Berlin.\nWhile sharing an apartment\nwith Iggy Pop, he created his\nmost experimental and critically\nacclaimed albums known as the\ntriptych. This legendary trilogy\nof Low, Heroes and Lodger mixed\nelectronic sounds with avant-garde\nlyrics to produce a profound song\ncycle.\nBowie\u2019s success peaked in the\n80s reaching number one with\nhis single \u2018Ashes To Ashes\u2019 which\nrevisited the story of Major Tom\nand breaking into funk pop with his\nfifteenth studio album \u2018Let\u2019s Dance\u2019.\nDuring this time he expanded his\ncreative repertoire starring in films\nsuch as Labyrinth and The Last\nTemptation Of Christ thanks to his\naward winning performance in The\nMan Who Fell To Earth. The 80s\nalso saw some of his biggest live\nperformances; in 1985 he took part\nin the Wembley Live Aid charity\nconcert.\nBowie also returned toWest Berlin\nwhere his gigantic 1987 gig outside\nthe Reichstag has been suggested as\nbeing one of the reasons of the fall\nof the Berlin wall two years later.\nOver the next two decades Bowie\nreturned to his unruly ways of\npushing the boundaries of music\ndelving into jungle, industrial,\ndrum\u2019n\u2019bass and jazztronica in\nalbums Outside, Earthling and\nHeathen (1995-2002). He also reexamined his rock\u2019n\u2019roll roots with\nband Tin Machine,probing metallic\nsounds. In Bowie tradition he was\none of the first artists to use the\ninternet to advertise his music and\ndownloading, whilst also setting up\nhis own service provider. As with\nhis enduring popularity he returned\nto headline Glastonbury in 2000,\nalmost three decades since he last\nplayed there.\nAfter an emergency angioplasty\ninterrupted his Reality Tour in\n2004 it was thought that Bowie\nhad retired from the music industry.\nHowever, he made a few surprise\nreturns, one on the big screen in the\n2006 film The Prestige.That year he\nalso performed in New York for a\ncharity event, which would end up\nbeing his last ever live performance.\nOn his 66th\nbirthday, with no\nwarning or anticipation, his website\nannounced a new studio album (his\n24th), along with releasing the new\nsingle \u2018Where Are We Now\u2019 to the\nshock and delight of fans around\nthe world. This 2013 album, The\nNext Day,was received well,proving\nBowie had lost none of his talent or\ncharm. The Next Day saw Bowie\nlook back at his past, while his latest\nalbum Blackstar looks towards the\nfuture, to another new sound. The\ncritically acclaimed Blackstar was\nreleased on his 69th\nbirthday, just\ntwo days later he sadly passed away.\nIt seems only right that up to his\nlast days David Bowie was still doing\nwhat he did best, characterising\nhis ideas and emotion for the\narts through beautiful creative\nmasterpieces.\nThe coolest man in the world (and\nout of this world) may have deprived\nus of one the greatest music talents\never to set foot on Earth, but he\nleft us the way he lived, rocking on\nforever. Who knows, maybe he got\nback into his spaceship and returned\nto the stars.\nPeter Munton\nWriter\nDavid Bowie\n1947 - 2016\nIndira Mallik\n\n"

Go see some art...\nIndira\u2019s Guide to Visual Art shows 2016\nOnce you\u2019ve exhasted all the theatres and resisted the West End, why not check out some of the spectacular visual\nart shows that are happening around London this term? From blockbuster exhibitions of well-loved artists to\nmore specialised takes on particular themes, there is a show for everyone and any occasion.\nPainting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse\n(Royal Academy, 30 January \u2013 20 April 2016)\nThe Royal Academy is starting off 2016, and brightening up winter with this blockbuster exhibition. Monet, who\nmade a career out of painting gardens, is the most obvious choice, but the exhibition will give a whirlwind tour\naround landscape painting in Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and the Avant-Garde movement. It will feature\nRenoir, Cezanne, Manet, Kandinsky, Van Gogh, Matisse and more. If you enjoyed Inventing Impressionism at the\nNational Gallery last year, this is a great follow-on.\nElectronic Superhighway (Whitechapel Gallery, 29 January - 15 May 2016)\nThe internet has played a huge part in shaping our cultural landscape this century and last few decades of the last;\nthis exhibition aims to examine the influence that computer technology has on the way that artists portray their\nideas and the world around them. It will feature over 100 multimedia works, dating from the 1960s, at the birth\nof the computer age right up to works created in the 2010s. It promises to be one of the most unique and exciting\nexhibitions this year.\nChampagne Life (Saatchi Gallery, 13 January - 6 March 2016)\nChampagne Life is the first Saatchi show entirely devoted to women artists and takes its title from a 2014 work by\nAmerican artist Julia Wachtel. It has been billed as an exhibition of female artists without making a feminist point.\nThe latter half of the statement does not bode particularly well for the curatorial message, and some have (perhaps\ncynically) pointed out this could be an attempt to rescue the gallery\u2019s reputation from the damage wreaked upon it\nby revelations surrounding Charles Saatchi\u2019s private life. Never mind the backstage drama, this exhibition will be\nworth going to just to see the work of the female artists who are often so little exhibited elsewhere.\nBotticelli Reimagined (V&A Museum, 5 March - 3 July 2016)\nBotticell\u2019s Birth of Venus has to be second only to the Mona Lisa, for the most reinterpreted.This exhibition will,\nas wells as exhibiting the originals will explore the ways that painting, fashion, film, drawing, photography, tapestry,\nsculpture and print have been influenced by Sandro Botticelli\u2019s paintings in the 500 years since his death. Artists\nfeatured include Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, William Morris, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Elsa Schiaparelli,\nAndy Warhol and Cindy Sherman.\nDelacroix and the Rise of Modern Art (National Gallery, 17 February - 22 May 2016)\nDelacroix is often thought to be the most influential artists of his era. He is credited with transforming French\nPainting in the 19th\ncentury, and his style, the way he subverted traditional rule of form and colour inspired more\nof his contemporaries, and the artists who followed. He paved the way for Impressionism and the evolution of\nmodern art. C\u00e9zanne observed, \u201cWe all paint in Delacroix\u2019s language\u201d.This exhibition will be the first presentation\nof Delacroix\u2019s art in Britain for more than 50 years. One not be missed.\n...or any of these cool picks.\nJJ\u2019s Guide to Other Stuff To See 2016\nWith my colleagues taking the major domains of theatre and visual art, I\u2019m left with telling you about all\nthe rest of the interesting artsy things London has to offer this term. That\u2019s opera, dance, spoken word and\nanything in between. I really should get more pages for this.\nLumiere London\n(Various spots around Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square, Westminster and King\u2019s Cross, until 17 January)\nIf you\u2019re still indoors at night this weekend, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. Go out and check out London\u2019s biggest\never light festival! Produced by Artichoke, the project decorates central London with exciting works from a huge\nvariety of artists and collectives. See your city in a new light, literally.\nThe Mikado (English National Opera, until 6 February)\nWho says opera has to be incomprehensible? While purists might cringe at the idea of an opera being sung in\nanything other than its original language, I\u2019m not averse to hearing them in English, especially not by the English\nNational Opera which has done some fine adaptations in the past. Despite cuts to its funding which ex-BBC Head\nof Music and Arts Humphrey Burton called \u201ccultural vandalism\u201d, the company presses on into the new year with\nJonathan Miller\u2019s Marx Brothers-inspired song-and-dance Mikado.The combination of Gilbert\u2019s virtuosic wit,\nSullivan\u2019s memorable melodies and Miller\u2019s hilarious antics should prove to be very entertaining. See it and judge for\nyourself the truth of Mr Burton\u2019s words.\nSpoken Word events ...everywhere!\nSpoken word in London is a vibrant, thriving scene and whether you\u2019ve always been a fan or are looking for\nsomething new to check out, there are loads of options available.The Poetry Cafe holds regular poetry readings,\nbook launches and open-mics, some with themes - check out their website for a full list. Southbank Centre similarly\nholds regular poetry events. If you\u2019re looking for something more informal and fun (read: with drinks), Jawdance is\na regular free spoken word open-mic night at Rich Mix in Shoreditch, while closer to home along Old Brompton\nthere is The Trobadour, a cafe which does regular readings - check out their website for the list of poets reading at\neach one. Bang Said the Gun brands itself as \u201cthe poetry event for people who don\u2019t like poetry\u201d, and happens at The\nRoebuck near Borough every Thursday. Book Slam is London\u2019s literary nightclub - with live music! It happens at a\ndifferent venue each time, and this month it will be at the National Maritime Museum on the 29th\nof January.\nTerra (Print Room at The Coronet, 23 February - 12 March)\nI\u2019ve always loved Print Room and their refreshing productions.Their dance programme begins this year with the\nworld premiere of Hubert Essakows\u2019 Terra, the final piece of his trilogy exploring the elements water, fire and earth.\nSix dancers journey through the shifting horizons of an unpredictable earth in a fundamental search for home. It\nis accompanied by an original poem by Booker-prize winning novelist Ben Okri and music by French composer\nJean Michel-Bernard.This will be the first dance performance in the main auditorium of Print Room\u2019s new home\nat the converted Coronet theatre in Notting Hill - a charming venue aptly suited to multi-faceted, integrative\nperformances such as this.\nL\u2019Etoile (Royal Opera House, 1 February - 24 February 2016)\nIt seems to be the season for comic operas! This is the Royal Opera\u2019s first production of Chabrier\u2019s fabulously\nfrothy comic opera, and should be a good show. I mean, this opera has a king who always celebrates his birthday\nwith a public impalement - what can be better? He goes in disguise among his people to find a suitable victim, and\nruns into a young pedlar who insults him, but realises that he cannot kill him as their stars are bound too closely.\nDefinitely one of the masterpieces of the genre, and well, it\u2019s the ROH.\n\n"

Photo Credit: Guardian\nN\new year, new you; the\nonly time of the year\nwhen there\u2019s a dramatic\nincrease in the number\nof cyclists on the roads \u2013 with the\nexception of during tube strikes,\nthat is. As a cyclist, there\u2019s a definite\nsense of safety in numbers,and more\npeople taking up this underrated\nmethod of getting around can only\nbe a good thing. Unfortunately,\nmore people on the road tends to\nhave the negative effect of enraging\nthe more automotively inclined of\nthe other road users.\nLondon roads are the domain\nI become a\nmajor target\nfor all sorts\nof abuse,\nranging from\nthe verbally\noffensive\nto the\ndownright\ndangerous\nof buses, bikes, the black cab, the\nwhite van men, moped-riding\ndelivery drivers, and increasingly,\nUbers. Compared to the vast\nmajority of the world, the public\ntransport in London is excellent,\nand unless you have a very good\nreason, you should not be driving\nyour personal vehicle within Zone 1\n(or at a push, Zone 2) of London.\nCycling is undeniably the cheapest,\nquickest, most environmentally\nfriendly, and healthiest way to get\naround London, but in order to\ntake advantage of this two-wheeled\ntransportation, you have to be\nprepared to withstand a constant\nbarrage of abuse.\nI am a tiny woman, usually in a\nflowery dress, riding the smallest\ncommercially available adult\nwomen\u2019s bicycle you can buy.\nSomehow, as soon as my wheels hit\nthe road,I become a major target for\nall sorts of abuse, ranging from the\nverbally offensive to the downright\ndangerous.\nIn every other part of my life,\nI would be horrified if people\nregularly took it upon themselves\nto publicly attack me, and I\u2019m sure\nthat outside of their vehicles, these\ndrivers would be mortified at the\nidea of roaring abuse at a young\nwoman on the street. So why is it\nthat as soon as I\u2019m balanced on two\nwheels, I\u2019m such a target?\nI understand that it\u2019s infuriating\nfor drivers as cyclists whizz past\nthem through traffic lights while\nthey\u2019re forced to wait, knowing\nthat if they were to do the same,\nthe punishment would be much\nmore severe. I know that it seems\nsilly that drivers have to pull out\nto overtake the same cyclist several\ntimes as they keep catching up to\nthem at the traffic lights.\nMotorists are right: cyclists don\u2019t\nfollow the same rules of the road.As\na cyclist you have to be constantly\non your guard. You can\u2019t assume\nthat if you obey the laws of the road,\nyou will complete your journey\nunharmed. You can\u2019t assume that a\ncar at a roundabout is going to stop\nwhen it\u2019s your right of way, or that\na lorry turning out of a side street\nwill be paying enough attention not\nto plough straight into you. Unlike\ncars, we can\u2019t always keep signalling\nthroughout a manoeuvre, because\nwe need our hands to cling onto our\nhandlebars while we navigate the\nvast array of potholes, drains, and\nmanhole covers that pose constant\nhazards.\nWe have to make our way to the\nfront at traffic lights, and constantly\nlook around and make eye contact\nwith other road users so that they\u2019re\ndefinitely aware of our existence.\nWe have to cycle assertively,\nwithstanding all sorts of tirades as\nwe dominate a narrow carriageway.\nAs a motorist, you take it for\ngranted that you will arrive safely\nat your destination; as a cyclist, it\u2019s\na constant battle.\nWith just cars on the road, any\nmistakes just result in mishaps,\nmaybe a scrape on a bumper here\nand there. When there are bikes,\nthese mistakes can easily become\nfatal. Bikes make drivers ever so\nresponsible for their errors, and\nthat\u2019s what makes them so angry.\nWe are the most vulnerable road\nusers. We zip along astride a thin\nframe, without a heavy metal shell\nencasing us, only inches from\nmassive machines that we are\nforced to trust. The only thing that\nsometimes protects us from our\nsurroundings is a small piece of\npolystyrene strapped to our heads.\nUnlike pedestrians, we\u2019re expected\nto compete for space with cars and\nbuses and lorries,accepting the risks\nthat our daily commute brings.\nAll guidance for cyclists comments\non the expectation of constant abuse,\nand how to avoid reacting. Why is\nit that we don\u2019t have a right to feel\nsafe on the road? Why is it that the\nonly way we can positively describe\ncycling is by calling it exhilarating?\nWhy is it\nthat we\ndon\u2019t have\na right to\nfeel safe on\nthe road?\n\n"

He\nflew his Standard Cirrus glider in\nthe Club Class of the competition,\nover ten gruelling days of crosscountry racing in thermals that\nlofted the gliders to over 13,000\nfeet across the arid Australian\nterrain. Each day the gliders had\nto race each other over courses of\nup to 500km, often at speeds of\nwell over 100mph, using powerful\ndesert thermal updrafts to gain\nenergy and travel along the route.\nThe fastest pilot around each task\nwas awarded the most points for the\nday. Tom\u2019s team mate, Sam Roddie,\ntook home the bronze medal in the\nClub Class making sure that Team\nGB dominated the podium at the\nclosing ceremony.\nThanks to some strong\nperformances and teamwork in\nchallenging cloudless conditions,\nTom and Sam led the competition\nin 1st\nand 2nd\nplaces respectively at\nthe halfway point, with a strong\nlead over the closely matched\nGerman rivals. A difficult couple of\ndays followed, which included both\nGB team mates failing to complete\nthe course on one day and landing\nshort of the airfield, losing valuable\npoints. This dropped Tom and Sam\nto 2nd\nand 7th\nplace overall going in\nto the last day. A brave, last minute\ndecision to risk it all and go all out\nfor the win paid off after a nerve-wracking flight. A costly mistake\nfrom the Germans on the last leg\nallowed Tom to snatch back the\nGold medal, and team mate Sam to\nrecover to Bronze medal position at\nthe last possible opportunity.\nTom Arscott commented,\n\u201cIt was an absolutely amazing\nexperience. The weather conditions\nwere very different from flying in\nthe UK, and the standard of the\ncompetition was extremely high. So\nto come away with the gold medal is\nunbelievable\u2026 It is definitely going\nto take a while to sink in!\u201d\nHe joins an ever-increasing list of\nWorld Champion glider pilots who\nwere inspired by flying at Imperial\nwith ICGC, forming part of the\nrich history of the club. The club\ndates back to 1930, which makes\nthe Gliding Club one of the oldest\nclubs at Imperial and the oldest\nUniversity gliding club in Europe.\nThe club started out with an\nImperial student designed and\nmanufactured glider named \u2018IC1 Incredible\u2019, 86 years ago in the\npioneering days of aviation. After\nmany hours of labour, the glider\nwas carefully transported to the\nclub\u2019s first summer flying camp at\nGore Farm, near Shaftsbury, but\nunfortunately it was blown over\nand damaged before it could be\nflown. Following this inauspicious\nstart, ICGC went from strength to\nstrength,andby1938,memberswere\nsuccessfully competing in the British\nGliding National Championships.\nThe club has recorded its history at\nwww.icgcarchive.co.uk.\nImperial College Gliding Club\nnow operates its own modern fleet\nof gliders at Lasham Airfield in\nHampshire, comprising of one\nGrob 103C two-seat trainer for\ndual flying instruction by expert\ninstructors, and two glass fibre\nsingle seat racing gliders for cross\ncountry and competition flying.The\nclub runs two gliding trips every\nweekend to the airfield as long as\nthe weather permits. All members\nhave the opportunity to (and many\ndo!) learn to fly solo and develop\ntheir skills flying cross-country and\nin competitions.\nThe current ICGC glider fleet\nTom further commented,\n\u201cAlthough I started learning to\nglide before I joined Imperial, it was\nreally only once I became a member\nof Imperial College Gliding Club\nthat I was able to progress my\nflying.Being able to regularly fly the\nclub\u2019s two high performance single\nseat gliders meant that I was able\nto start flying cross-country and\nenter my first competitions, all on\na regular student budget. Without\nattending the regular gliding trips\nrun by the club, with access to both\nthe equipment and knowledgeable\ninstructors, I almost certainly would\nnot have been able to achieve what\nI have done today. I really would\nencourage anyone with an interest\nin flying to come along and get\nin the air. It really is one of the\ncheapest ways to go flying and I\ncan assure you that you won\u2019t be left\ndisappointed!\u201d\nHaving recently graduated from\nMechanical Engineering in 2015,\nTom spends many of his weekends\nvolunteering his time instructing\nand inspiring the next generations\nof ICGC members to experience\nthe challenge and reward of\nlearning soaring flight. It\u2019s a sport\nthat is open to everyone regardless\nof any experience, and surprisingly\naffordable on a normal student\nbudget. So who knows? You could\nbe learning to fly with a current\nWorld Champion!\nMeanwhile, on the back of\nhis outstanding performance\nin Australia, Tom will be again\nrepresenting Great Britain at the\nupcoming Senior World Gliding\nChampionships to be held in\nLithuania in August. We wish him\nthe best of luck.\nJON PRING\nTom waits to launch in 40\u00b0C heat.
