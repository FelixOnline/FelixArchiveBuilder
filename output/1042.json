    "content": "TWENTY TWO FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 24TH1995 LETTERS\nOS C WEEK L To increase overall awareness of the various\noverseas cultures present in Imperial College\n2. To promote the activities of the various overseas\nsocieties\nMost active per\n12noon2 pm Letters to Felix: DOMINATED BY CONS OC BEIT HALL\nSUB-WARDEN REQUIRED\nA vacancy exists for the post of Sub-Warden in Beit Hall.\nWe are seeking to appoint a suitable individual to this post\nfrom the start of February 1996. The duties include; pastoral\ncare of students, organisation of social events and involvement in the day to day running of the Hall. The successful\ncandidate is expected to be highly motivated to carry out\nthese type of activities. The ability to take responsibility\nwhilst maintaining friendly relations with students is essen-ti al. Although the post is open to any member of College a post-graduate student or post-doctoral researcher with a minimum of 18 months remaining in the College is pre-fer red. The accommodation available with this post is suitable for a couple.\nApplications comprising a covering letter, a curriculum vitae\nand two letters of reference should be sent to Dr Jon\nMarangos, LA SP2, Physics (47857 (Work) or 49453 (Flat)).\nThe closing date for applications is the 15th December 1995\n(although under certain circumstances later applications may\nbe considered).\nEditor,\nNooman Haque raised some\nvery important points in his article last week. The Prime\nMinister, the new Foreign\nSecretary and the Conservative\nParty are completely opposed to\nthe dated Utopian fantasy of\nEurofederalism. It is vital that\nMalcolm Rifkind gets unequivocal support from the Commons\nand the country for his defence\nof our sovereignty at the coming\nIntergovernmental Conference\n(IGC). His position will be\nundermined if the Labour Party\nopportunistic ally accuses the\nGovernment of \"being isolation-ist\" etc when the disagreements\nstart...\nWe will challenge Labour to\ndenounce the manifesto when\nwe debate Europe, a crucial issue\nat the next election, with them\non Thursday November 30th at\n12.30 pm in the Brown\nCommittee Room. Perhaps they\nwill also be able to explain why\nthe French and German governments are trying to postpone the\nIGC until after a possible Labour\nvictory in order to strengthen\ntheir position.\nIan Bayley\nCon Soc Chairman\nEditor,\nMany students have been\nincensed by the dreadful account\nof the John Gummer meeting in\nFelix...\n...If Felix continue to produce such gro t then we shall recommend that only a photograph\nof the Minister talking should be\nincorporated into the issue. If\nthis is too much trouble it may\nbe a good idea for you not to\nbother. Readers will, of course,\nbe able to read a factual account\non our WWW pages. The biased\nelement is deliberately kept to a minimum.\nRegards,\nGeoff Boon\nConsoc Vice Chairman\nDear Felix,\nCongrattilations on your\nreport about John Glimmer's visit! I can tell whoever wrote it\nhas a bright future in journalism,\ntabloid journalism that is...\n...In future could you please\nreport about our speakers accurately. Yours\nIan Davey\nConsoc Secretary\nDear Ed,\nAfter Michael Ludlam's amusing article about the lack of\nwomen at Imperial, I couldn't resist bringing up yet another\npoint in this long running debate,\nMichael asks 'where else can you\nfind so many men alone in one\nplace?' ...how about in industry?\nFace it guys, 27% is an incredibly\nhigh ratio compared to life in the\n'real world', especially for those\nwho pursue a career in engineer-ing... I spent my year out working for a major chemical company where there were less than\n2% women on site. Coming to\ncollege, even to Mech Eng, was a real change. Even the sciences at\nschool for a female are dominated by males. I never really\nexpected university to be any\ndifferent, although it appears\nmost of my male friends did.\nIt's time IC man stopped\nbemoaning his fate and, to put it\nbluntly, 'got a life'! How do you\nexpect to meet women (ever!) if\nyou spend your evenings either\nworking (yes, I meet the geeks)\nor in the bar with the lads. There\nas many female students as men\nin London... Try visiting UL U or\njoin those clubs and societies\nthat have a male/female mix\nand/or visit other colleges in\nLondon. If you don't take the\ninitiative now, when do you\nthink all these women are going\nto materialise in your life?\nSuzanne McDermott\nMech Eng II\n\n"

    "content": "T he British hangover has a few interesting equivalents in various continental languages. For instance, if\nyou went on a booze-cruise to\nFrance the final stage of your drinking binge\nwould be called 'gue ule de bois' (literally:\nwooden face). In Spain you might suffer 'la\nresaca', which roughly translated means 'back-wash', and in Germany \"der Kater\" implies you\nare in an indolent, apathetic state similar to that\nof a cat. Finally, in Norway, \"tom mermen n\" refers to a carpenter's noisy work that goes on\nand on in your head. Since the hangover is such\na universal phenomenon, I decided to interview\nDr Peter Dorward, my GP, to find\nout what causes the familiar symptoms of the hangover, and what can\nbe done to prevent them.\n\u00a9 Symptom: I'm dying of thirst\nThe main consequence of drinking\nis dehydration. What makes you feel\nso thirsty in the morning is a hormonal process linked to the Anti Diuretic\nHormone ( ADH if you prefer).\nAlcohol stops its production and\nmakes the kidneys produce a lot of\nurine. This means you loose all your\nwater supplies.\n\u00a9 Symptom: My body hurts\nDr Dorward explained that the\nimmediate physical cause of pain and\nnausea is due to an irritation of the\nstomach called gastritis. It usually\ntakes few days of abstinence for it to\nheal.\n\u00a9 Symptom: I feel like death\nNo less than a third of the alcohol\nintake goes directly into the blood\nstream via the stomach walls. The\nremaining alcohol is absorbed rapidly\nin the small intestine. As a result, contaminated blood goes through all the\norgans and cells before reaching the brain.\n\u00a9 Symptom: My head hurts\nBy the time the contaminated blood reaches\nthe brain, you are bound to be subject to a headache. Red wines and most other dark beverages contain tannin. These impurities make\nheadaches worse because they poison you. You\nwill find it absolutely preferable to drink vodka\nif you wish to avoid the consequences of this\ntoxin accumulation.\nUnfortunately, it's not that easy to avoid a headache - other factors are involved. Inside the\nliver, chemical and enzymatic processes convert\nalcohol (known as ethanol to its intimate con-no is s eur s) into a highly toxic substance called\nacetaldehyde. Further chemical processes will\nthen reduce this toxin to acetate, a harmless\nchemical, but the efficiency of this process\ndepends on the amount of enzyme available in\n>in\nWhat Causes Hangovers?\nWaking up feeling like death itself is a normal component of\nstudent life. But what is the scientific reason for all those missed\nnine o 'clock lectures? Sabine Louet explains the cause of the curse\nof the morning after.\nin the blood stream depends on the\nweight, age and sex of the drinker.\nWhatever the feminists say, the biological evidence shows that Mother\nNature built women with more subcutaneous fat and a smaller blood volume than men. Unfortunately, this\ndictates that alcohol concentration\nwill always be higher in women than\nin men for the same amount of alcohol consumed.\nIt is worth considering that there is\nno way to accelerate the removal of\nalcohol from the blood. Hence, after\nan evening where you drink more\nthan 6 pints, you might still be above\nthe driving limit the next morning. 12\nhours are necessary to clear it all.\nIf you want to avoid a hangover, the\nbest way to do it is this: before you go\nto bed, simply to drink an amount of\nwater equal to the amount of alcohol\nyou drunk earlier that evening (this\nmay not always be practical, either\nbecause you couldn't hold ten pints of\nwater all at once or because you can't remember what you've had).\nIt appears that for heavy drinkers,\nthe fall of alcohol level causes anxiety.\nIronically, the only cure for addicts is to give\nthem more alcohol. As Joe.E. Lewis underlined,\nit's a vicious cycle where you finally end up saying : \" I drink to forget that I drink\".\nAlcohol exposed \u2022\nWe drink ethanol C2H5O H which is a colourless, flammable liquid with a mild\nodour and strong taste.\nB Among other uses it is required for pick\u2022\nI ling, polishing and paint stripping.\n\u2022\nOur daily energy needs can be met by the\nequivalent of 15 to 25 pints of beer, which\nis enough to kill you.\nthe body. In fact, genetic factors are responsible\nfor the availability of these enzymes and this\nmeans susceptibility to alcohol addiction could\nbe genetic too.\nlb a sober observer, heavy drinkers can often\nappear to be nervous or be seen to shake. This is\na sign of alcohol addiction and is probably caused\nby a drop in alcohol level in the blood.\nA few tips on our favourite drug: the faster\nalcohol is absorbed, the higher the peak in concentration of alcohol in the blood. The same\namount of alcohol absorbed slowly won't cause\nyou to feel as drunk, but it will remain in your\nblood for a longer period. Choosing to down a few whiskeys will therefore have more effect in\nthe short term than 'a few beers'. Fizzy drinks\nlike Champagne or gin and tonic are absorbed\neven more quickly. However, taking a meal will\nslow down the absorption by around 50% since\nthe stomach will empty more slowly.\nMore generally, the level of alcohol contained\nX "

FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 24TH1995 NEWS\nNews in brief\nContinued from front page\nLondon taking advantage of the\nready supply in the southeast.\nEcstasy mainly comes into the\ncountry from Holland and\nBelgium but there are also many\nfactories in this country, though\nthey tend to be smaller and less\norganised.\nFelix spoke to a dealer, Mr\nWright, who has supplied\nImperial students with E in the\npast. He explained that some of\nthe basis for IC's Ecstasy culture\nlay in the popularity of Ea few\nyears ago amongst those who\nwent to raves. Since about 1992,\nwhen rave was at its height, he\nhas seen a decrease in demand\nand price. This more or less\nagrees with the figures that the\nPolice have published in the\npast.\nWhen asked how much\nmoney he made peddling his\nwares around college, Mr Wright\ndeclined to reveal exact figures.\nHe did say that if you buy Es in\nthe 1000s, you can expect to pay\nabout \u00a35 each, and then sell\nthem on for \u00a315 individually.\n\"The largest dealers buy from\nthe factories in units of 10-20,000 pills.\"\nMr Wright said he had\nbecome more wary of the effects\nof the drug following the tragic\ndeath of Leah Betts and the\nensuing public debate. Leah took\nher first E on her eighteenth\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nChris Smith, Labour MP for\nIslington South and Finsbury and\nShadow Cabinet spokesman on\nSocial Services, was a guest of\nIC's Labour Society on\nWedneday. Making up for the\ndelay getting to IC, Mr Smith\nplunged straight into a discourse\nabout the opportunities for\nBritain heralded by the\nInformation Revolution.\nCiting some examples of\nhow the widespread use of modern technology and computers\nhad increased knowledge and\nimproved learning, the MP said\nhe felt that it would be a wasted\nbirthday and subsequently collapsed into a coma from which\nshe did not recover.\nSome users he knew had\nexperienced problems when\nusing E; one person had had fits\nand spasms after taking the drug,\nand another had suffered from\nliver problems. He was keen to\nemphasise that having reliable\ncontacts helps to ensure that the\nEs you buy are pure or safe, but\nthe only way you can be fairly\ncertain is to try one, or at least to\nknow someone who has taken\none.\nFaced with the decline in\nthe use of E, Mr Wright said that\ncocaine is definitely becoming\nmore popular, more readily\navailable and less expensive.\n\"Even poor students are doing\ncoke these days,\" he said.\n\"People tend to move on from E to cocaine, and I would say most\nof the people who were into\nEcstasy in 1991 are now doing\ncoke.\"\nCollege authorities have in\nthe past expressed concern over\nthe level of drug use at IC, especially the use of cannabis. The E threat is one that has largely gone\nun reported so far, with few if\nany incidents being Ecstasyrelated. A rise in cocaine use\ncould worry the College, as the\neffects on its users are greater\nand more long lasting than those\nof Ecstasy and cannabis.\nchance if nothing were done to\nharness and exploit Britain's advantages in this field. He particularly emphasised the role of\nthe telecommunications giant BT\nin creating the country-wide network of cabling required to\nachieve the goal of allowing\neveryone access to the internet.\nAfter his speech, Mr Smith\nopened the floor to questions,\nwith subjects ranging from payment for the internet terminals\nto the decision-making process\nof the Labour Party.\nCommenting on his recent move\nfrom the Heritage portfolio, he\nsaid it was a shame that he had-BY MARK BRIDGE\nAND DIPAK G HO SH Web Editor\nThe Student Representative\nCouncil ratified the creation of\nthe new student office of Web\nEditor in their meeting on\nNovember 14th at St Mary's Union.\nThe Officer will be responsible for ensuring that laws relating to publications, which are de\nfacto applicable to the electronic\nmedia, are not contravened and\nalso that Union and College\nguidelines are met in all such\nClub and Society publications.\nOther responsibilities of the\npost will include ensuring that\nmemory allocations for the pages\nare not exceeded. Nomination\npapers are going to be drawn up\nand the Council will select\nsomeone at their first meeting\nnext term.\nThe system is currently\nmaintained on an informal basis\nby Matt Crompton, Deputy\nPresident for Finance and\nServices.\nDisappointing Rag\nA Rag source blamed the\nabsence of a Rag Chair for two\nweeks in the middle of the term\nn't had a chance to follow up\nideas, especially the Information\nSuperhighway.\nRejecting criticism of the\nrecent 'policy on the hoof scandals in the national press, he said\nthat the problem been solved.\nHe went on to state the Party's line on the privatisation of BR,\nsaying that Labour are adamant\nthat the scheme will fail, and it is\nonly a matter of time before any\npartial privatisation is reversed.\nMr Smith finished his talk\nby explaining how Labour will\nfund its ideas, including the use\nof more private capital for pro-j ect s. for the poor organisation of, and\nturn-out at events during Rag\nWeek.\nDamp Disciplinary\nA Union Disciplinary\nCommittee convened on\nTuesday night reprimanded a physics and a mathematics student and imposed a twenty\npound fine for urinating from\nthe fourth floor of the Union\nbuilding.\nThe Union also informed\ntheir counterparts at Brighton\nUniversity about the conduct of\none of their philosophy students\nwho was also involved in the\nincident.

Sixteen\nbills were announced, the majority of which\nseem to be fairly unexciting. The one part that\nhas caused controversy is the Asylum and\nImmigration Bill. The main aim of this legislation\nis to cut the number of illegal immigrants and\nspeed up the acceptance of genuine cases. It will\nalso cut the level of benefits paid to asylum seek-ers, in order to deter those seeking a higher standard of living by masquerading as political\nrefugees. If properly implemented, this should\nnot become a racist's charter as predicted by\nsome organisations, but a way of ensuring that\nimmigration is conducted fairly and eff ici end y, and a guarantee that the asylum seekers who set-tie here are those whose well-being is at grave\nrisk in their home countries, for which this country has a proud record.\nIn College, there have been yet more complaints about the installation of the new cannabis\ndetection system in the halls of residence. To be\nfair, it does have additional features such as fire detection to\njustify its cost, but even by IC\nstandards, this project has been\ncatastrophic in the extreme.\nThe installation has dragged on\nfor years at God knows what\ncost, resulting in false alarms on a near daily basis\nfor weeks.

A recent survey showed that the\naverage debt for students\nbetween 18 and 21 is \u00a32,500\nrising to \u00a34,500 in the age group\nover 26.\nThis debt along with high\ngraduate unemployment discourages young people from\nworking and lower middle class\nfamilies from entering higher\neducation... Another recent survey has shown that the richest\n20% of families receive ten\ntimes more of the money spent\non HE than the poorest 20%...\nThe cuts in grants reflects the\noverall under funding of education in the last sixteen years.\nThis merely highlights the\nshort-term is m of this govern-ment. They were happy to\nencourage student numbers to 1\nin 3 young people but then\nabandoned them by failing to\nrealise the overall long-term\nbenefits of a well educated\nworkforce. We now see that our\nmajor competitors are all better\ntrained and better educated\nthan us which can only have\ndetrimental economic effects.\nHowever, Mr Boon wants\nto see students paying for the\nconservatives to cut taxes for\ntheir rich friends. The promise\nof tax cuts for the rich will not\nbe enough to blind the British\nelectorate at the next election.\nSo Mr Boon, stop defending the indefensible and recognise this as yet another flawed\nTory policy.\nC.

It's just, well,\nthere didn't particularly seem to\nbe a great deal of point to the\nexercise.\nIt seems perfectly reasonable that our sabbaticals should\nbe mocked in public for the sake\nof the common good, but the\ncharming gentlemen who\nchained me to the rails of Da\nVincis were singularly incapable\nof telling me quite why. 'It's for\nRag! It's for Rag' was all I got,\nand they couldn't even tell me\nwhat charities they were sup-porting.\nAnd I hardly felt inspired to\ntrust the good judgement of\nthose fun-loving Raggies in a week full of allegations of the\nMines Dirty Disco Organisers\ndrinking the evening's proceeds.\nWednesday night was all a bit\ndistressing really.

FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 24TH1995 FEATURE\n\u2022 \u2022 IF1 It a JI% J23 pi Jri\u00bb iS3 l1J F%M^ Hi(% HiV Fe//x explores the world of (a img use; a world\nwhich we all Inhabit whether we know it or not.\nand the\nworld\nLet's be honest. I'm addicted, and so are\nyou. To what? Take your pick: alcohol, cig-are tte s, chocolate, caffeine, ecstasy...\nEcstasy? Surely its a little odd to include\nit in such a list? Perhaps not. It seems\nthat many young people regard popping\nan E as being about as illegal as swiping\nthe odd traffic cone.\nWitness Leah Bett's untimely death\nlast week. She was a bright, sensible\nyoung girl with everything going for her.\nHer parents - an ex-police officer and a j nurse - had been responsible in her i upbringing and warned her of the dangers\nof taking drugs. Yet in the early hours of\nSunday last week, Leah collapsed an later\ndied after taking a pill of unadulterated\nEcstasy.\nWhy did she do it? The answer is sim-ple. Drugs are fun. Drugs make you feel\ngood. This is what today's young people\nbelieve, inspired by such sayings as, \"If you\ncan remember the 60s then you weren't there\". The 'good times' ethic of the previous generation has been translated into the\ndrug and rave scene of today.\nThe media's response to Leah's death\nwas predictable; \"It Could Be Your Child\"\nscreamed the headlines. Ministers will no\ndoubt be under pressure to 'get tough' on\ndrugs and increase prison sentences for drug\noffences.\nBut for the last 20 years this has been\nhappening and the \"war against drugs\" is\nV^ being lost. What is needed is a new\napproach, yet the Labour MP Clare Short\nwas universally condemned for merely suggesting that there should be public debate\non legal ising certain drugs.\nIt was recently estimated that ec st a> sy kills 50 people a year in Britain. This is\nlargely due to the environment in which its\ntaken - hot and frantic night-clubs. The\ngovernment has responded by releasing a white paper that proposes to force such\nvenues to provide free fresh cold\nwater.\nAlcohol kills hundreds and is responsible for over half the rapes and murders\ncommitted each year, but John Major\nisn't rushing to crack down on pubs and\noff-licenses. This is because it's( mis-taken ly) believed that alcohol can be\nused responsibly and isn'ta significant\ndanger to one's health.\nWhy doesn't the government admit\nthat it can't stop people taking drugs (of\nboth the legal and illegal kind)? It should\ninstead concentrate its effort on making it\nsafer for drug users. If this means legal ising some drugs, then that's for the best.\nLegalisation may also reduce the crime\nassociated with drugs - The Economist has\nbeen in favour of de criminal is ation since\n1993, along with a group of senior police\nofficers and judges who suggested it was\ntime to \"think the unthinkable.\"\nIt is society as a whole, not just the gov-ern ment, needs to address the issue of drug\nuse in a mature and honest manner. Whilst\nthe use of drugs should not be encouraged,\nthe responsible use of drugs should be\nemphasised. Until this happens, more\nyoung people will die for simply trying to\nhaving a good time.\nMark Baker yourself:\nalcoholic?\nDo you drink too much? Think you can handle your beer? Find out simply and quickly if\nyou are an alcoholic with this invaluable\nFelix self-test. Just honestly answer the following questions, then check your score...\n1. You buy your beer from:\na) the pub\nb) the off-license\nc) the brewery\n2. Drambuie is:\na) a Scottish castle?\nb)a damn fine whiskey\nc) too expensive - aftershave is better value\n3.

NINETEEN\nYacht Racing\nThe British Student Nationals and the ED HE C Student Regatta\nrepresent the Yacht Club's highlight of this year's racing programme. The\nStudent Nationals are held during the last weekend of March, involving\nthe 20 most competitive crews in the country. The ED HE C regatta is\nthe largest international student event on the continent: 3000 students\nwill meet in La Rochelle (France), from 20 to 28 April to compete in the\nmost gruelling series of races. Apart from the high level of racing, the\ncrew also represents the College during the social events organised by the\nsponsors present at the race.\nWORK HARD, PLAY HARD!! We have already raised one third of the necessary budget but are currently\nlooking for further sponsorship to meet our ambitious targets.

There are only so many jokes you can make\nabout snoring and shaky beds so enough said.\nIn the morning we were up in time to watch\nthe Power rangers, an event unheard of in the lives\nof most students.Out onto the water in the\nmorning: the rain the night before had not quite\ndone its job but it was still coming down and the\nriver was on the increase. True to the nature of\nthings, some people decided that upright was not\nthe correct way to shoot rapids. Most of these\nunfortunates soon learned that an upright position\nis preferable however and the day was spent\nperfecting this new mode of travel. Fortunately the\nwater was quite warm so no-one got really cold and\nat least our new kit was fully tested for leaks and\nwarmth.After a day on the river we went to the pub\nas if I had to mention it. The food was a wise\nchoice but the price list for beer had been stolen\nfrom the Gloucester Hotel.\nOverall the Saturday night was much quieter\nexcept when the chairman, Ross Oldfield, decided\nin a drunken haze to get out of the wrong side of\nthe bed, next to a wall, and scratch around looking\nfor an exit. A few kicks to the head soon sorted this\nsmall problem out.In the morning, (well just about)\nthe river was much fuller. Loads of water means\nmore fun and fewer rocks to spank into. Altogether\na much more successful day with much less\nswimming and a good time was had by all.\nIf you want to join the canoeing club we meet\nup in Beit Quad on Tuesdays at 7.15 pm and go\nover to the swimming pool at 7.30.

    "content": "album: the beatles -anthology 1 babe magnet Below: The Beatles in Hamburg around\n1960 when Ringo wasn'ta star(r) and Pete\nBest and Stuart Sutcliffe were preparing to\nbe footnotes in musical history.\nThe new single, 'Free as a Bird', is slapped at the\nstart of this double album, sounding processed\nand forced. The anthology proper then starts in\n1958 with the group's first ever recording. Singles\nand live performances, some never previously\nreleased, follow. This part of the anthology (there\nare at least two more to come) draws to a close\nin 1964.\nThe music itself is vibrant and due to the live\nperformances, exciting. With hordes of screaming\nfans threatening to drown out the band's sounds,\nit's hard not to get swept along.\nGems include a series of rehearsals for and\nthen a complete recording of 'One After 909', a live 'She Loves You', and a bluesy 'No Reply'. A Hard Day's Night' and 'Eight Days a Week' are\nalso very different to the previously released ver-s ions. Against this, you do have to endure the horror of a Beades/Morecambe and Wise duet:\nThis release has to be viewed on two different levels; as an historical document and as a musical piece. It's superlative in the former\naspect, but less impressive in the latter - the collection doesn't offer much that is breathtakingly\nnew and sound quality is average.\nMind you, whatever reviewers say about this\nalbum, it's going to sell truck-loads. If you're a fan\nor want a nostalgia trip, you're going to buy this.\nOtherwise, take a listen when you buy it for your\nparents for Christmas. (7)\ngig: human league.:a la shi kov\" With a stage setting like a cross between an\nEighties sci-fi set and a hospital laundry, Human\nLeague appeared in The Royal Albeit Hall as a blast from the past to a cheering audience.\nThe audience quickly simmered down as the\nband played a mixture of older tracks and pieces\nfrom the 'Octopus' album to distinctly low-key\napplause. At a little over three-quarters capacity,\nthe turnout was disappointing, but as the group\nbuilt up to some of their better known tracks, the\ncrowd came alive again, as did the telescopic linen\nbaskets dominating the stage.\nCulminating initially with 'Tell me when', the\nencore again whipped up the public. And with\nmore classics such as 'Electric Dreams', it was\nfinally proved that most people can't dance to the\nHuman League.\nalbum: skyscraper -super state^ The British rock behemoth has been dormant for\nfar too long but Camden trio, Skyscraper have\nseen fit to re-awaken it from its\nslumber. They tried to kickstart\nsome life into its corpulent body\neighteen months ago but record\ncompany shenanigans and general ham-fist ed bureaucracy\ndelayed the release of their debut\nalbum (put your hands up EMI\nrecords and prepare to be shot at). If you were of\na paranoid disposition you might think it was a conspiracy.\nThankfully, 'Superstate' has arrived on indie\nlabel Dynosupreme and sounds as fresh and\ninspiring as it was supposed to. Produced by Roli\nMosimann, who has worked with such industrial\nluminaries as the Young Gods and Foetus, the\nalbum consists of songs that take the industrial\nfoundation and build cm n ching guitars, a canny\near for melody and downright\nhuman emotion on top.\n'Union Jack Off' is as visceral yet\narticulate diatribe against Fascism\nas you're likely to hear.\nElsewhere, 'Lovesick' is self-effacing but no less vitriolic, while\n'Bed of Nails' is a heartfelt number that grows from slow begin ri in gs into a pulsating but non-bombastic piece.\nThe album finishes with vocalist Vic Kemlicz\nsinging, \"There's always hope.\" For this band\nthere certainly is.

TWENTY-FOUR SPORT\nFELIX SPORT\nIC's Karate Boys\nSweep the Board\nAfter several weeks of arduous\ntraining and sparring practice,\nfour members of the Shotokan\nKarate Club signed up for\nthe South East London\nChampionships. The day kicked\noff with the Kata competition in\nthe morning, allowing IC's boys\nto assess the competition and\nbegin the psyche up. Two contestants from Imperial, Alexander\nBistis and Dmitri Tsapoulis were\nentered into the junior grades\nkumi te( sparring) whilst Edson\nDos Santos and Thomas Hill\nwere fighting against brown and\nblack belts.\nThe tournament was run on\na \"knockout\" system, meaning\nthat if you lost a fight you were\nout for the day.

Tom then was thrown into\nthe fray, and managed to win\nwith a perfectly executed roundhouse kick. Edson continued this\nwinning streak into the second\nand third rounds whilst Tom, to\nhis lack of experience and general nice guy attitude lost to a second dan black belt in the third.\nEdson though was seeded to fight\nthis black belt in the final.\nBefore that however, \"Hard\nMan\" Dmitiri and Alex \"the keen\none\" were to fight and beat all\nthe other competitors in their\ncategory which meant an all IC\nfinal. The fight itself was technically imperfect, with both students receiving warnings\nabout leaving the ring, but\nsome good techniques\ncame into play before the\nend, when Dmitri finally\ntriumphed, with Alex taking the silver.\nThen came the big clash.\nEdson walked up to the\nring as the crowd fell into\na respectful silence. The\ntwo fighters bowed, then\nfell into their fighting\nstances. Blows were\nexchanged, but it was\nEdson who scored first,\nwith a well executed\nbackhand strike, underlining his more confident and\naggressive approach,\nGoing into his \"Edson\nshuffle\" routine to confuse his opponent, he was\ndeclared winner after a long drawn out bout.\nX Country\nRun Rings\nAround Sad\nUCL Men\nAs the teams lined up for the\nstart, Imperial realised themselves to be missing two runners.\nInitial investigations showed\nthat Tom was distracted by a 'babe' (or a rhinoceros, depending on whose opinion you take),\nwhilst Jurgen was smitten with\nwho appeared to be Great Uncle\nBulgaria.\nMissing the start though\nwould appear to be of little\nimportance as two thirds of the\nIC team got lost. Obviously\nEmily didn't as she is dead good\nat map reading, and not a wh ing ing little girl ie, honest.\nFeeling somewhat embarrassed by the ease with which\nthey had defeated UCL, IC\noffered them a chance to settle\nthe score: a competitive Quad\nrun. Despite Satomi's eagerness\nthe rest of the team lived up to\nits lightweight reputation and,\namidst complaints of having\n'insufficient equipment',\nreturned to their homework,\nleaving IC's victorious runners to\ncelebrate in the Union.\nCunning\nAdvice\nGoldsmiths 3-0 ICWFC\nThe simple moral of this game\nis: never, ever, ever wear fluorescent pink gloves if you intend to\nhandle the football in the box.\nNo Surprise\nas Hockey\nTeam Lose\nOnce More\nFortunately for IC's hockey\nteam, Forest's70 thrashing at\nthe weekend makes their 4-0\ndefeat at the hands of the\nZambeian National Metallurgists\nSociety (6th XI), (aka RHUL)\nseem almost respectable.\nAlmost. I am sure that, had the\nreferee added another five minutes injury time, IC could have\neven hit the ball.\nThere is an old adage that\nit's the competing that counts,\nnot the winning. Sadly for IC, its\nthe coach ride home that counts,\nas they are summarily unable to\ncompete.\nAfter a poor start, IC's second XI's already low numbers\nwere further depleted to nine by\nG. Michael taking an early ambulance ride to A& E. After his remains had been\nremoved from the pitch a stirring and relentless effort by IC\nresulted in P.D. File leveling the\nmatch at one all, earning the seconds a draw which, of course,\nshould have been victory...\nSports News\nBlackburn Rovers put their\nChampionship challenge back on\ntrack with a70 destruction of\nNottinghan Forest, in a match which\nincluded a hat-trick for Alan Shearer.\nSouth Africa's Rugby Union side\nlooked very comfortable in beating\nEngland 24-14 at Twickenham last\nSaturday.\nEngland's ladies footballers consolidated their position in their qualification attempt for next year's European Championships by beating\ntheir Croatian counterparts by five\ngoals to nil.\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 24TH1995 NEWS\nRCSU Move to Biology\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nThe Royal College of Science\nUnion offices will move to temporary accommodation in the\nBiology department on\nDecember 4th. Their current\npremises in the Old Chemistry\nbuilding will become untenable\nwhen the power and water supplies are cut off in preparation\nfor the building's demolition in\nearly 1996.\nThe Union will eventually\nmove to customised premises in\nthe Civil Engineering depart-ment, but they look set to\nremain in the temporary accommodation until the end of\nJanuary. \"At the moment there's very little definite timescale,\"\nRCS Honourary Secretary Stuart\nJenkins said.\nWhilst admitting that they\nweren't happy with the situation,\nhe said that they 'couldn't com-plain' about the way the Estates\ndepartment had treated them,\nemphasising that College had\nbeen as helpful as possible.\nVal Straw, Facilities\nManager, met the RCSU executive on Wednesday and\nexplained that there was no\nalternative but to move the\noffices into temporary accommodation. The Old Royal\nCollege of Science building is\nbeing demolished so that building of the new Basic Medical\nSciences complex can begin.\nConstruction of the centre, set\nto open in 1997, is already\nbehind schedule.\nRCSU members are concerned that the move will make\nit difficult for them to operate\neffectively and be readily available to their members. The new\nlocation will only be accessible to\nholders of Biology department\nswipe cards outside standard\nworking hours, keeping most\nRCSU members from the\noffices.\nPHOTO: ALEX FE A KES The pavement in front of the Huxley building was occupied for a short time on Wednesday as Bangladeshi dissidents demonstrated\noutside their Embassy. The protesters declared a hunger strike to\nsupport the previous President, who is gravely ill in hospital, and\nneeds specialist treatment. Although the group had been met by an\nembassy official, they got little attention from South Kensington's populace.\nThe Union Executive have\nasked the biology department to\nallow wider access, but the\nRCSU admitted that it was\n'extremely unlikely' that such a breach of college security would\nbe approved. The RCSU 1920's fire engine, Jez, will remain in\nthe condemned chemistry building for the foreseeable future, as\nno alternative garage space is\navailable.\n3>m per tal College \u00a3et m ne \u00a3ei^ octet p^< Pre\u00a3ent\u00a3\nTHE LEBANESE\nPARTY\n1995\n1\nLebanese R IS'l'A l.i RANT MEMBERS: \u00a3 10\nFm dAy24 Tri NOVEMDER\nIC MAJN D ii\\i i\\q HAII\n7 . 0 0 p.M foR7.50 p.M NON-MEMBERS: \u00a3 14\nHAVE A TASTE of OUR (Miaous LEbANESE food supplied by THE 'LnbANESE RESTAURANT'\nANd ENJoy THE belly dAN ciNq show pERfoRMEd by 'NAWAI'.\nFOR TICKETS, PLEASE CONTACT: Shucrallah Younis (ChemEng4) Tel: 0171-373 3302\nSami Nasr (Materials 2)\nIlias Avdos (Chem Eng 4) Elias Sahyoun (Mech Eng 4)\n\n"

A group of\nstudents followed the intruder\nand alerted College Security,\ndetaining the man until Police\narrived.\nThe description of the man\ncaught at Weeks apparently fits\nthat of a6'3\" Afro-Caribbean\nman who has been spotted wandering around Evelyn Gardens\non many occasions. He typically\ntried to gain entry from the back\nof the building and proceeded to\ntry students' doors for entry. A large number of items were\nreported missing during this\nperiod. Several residents reported incidents in which the man\nwould ask to borrow a pen, and\nthen leave.\nNo one had actually challenged anyone at Evelyn Gardens\nuntil Tuesday night, when a man\nentered a room and encountered\ntwo residents who immediately\ncalled security. The man ran off.\nOne of the two residents, in\na ground floor room, said his suspicions were aroused when he\nsaw a man looking in through\ntheir window earlier that\nevening. A man said to fit the\ndescription of this intruder was\napprehended later that night at\nWeeks. The two Evelyn Gardens\nresidents were called to see if\nthey could identify the man.\nThe police could only comment that enquiries were continuing at Belgravia. However, it is\nbelieved that the man could be a part of a group of three people\nwho have been targeting IC this\nyear.\nSecurity sources say there\nhas been a general increase in\npetty crime reports from residents of Imperial halls. In one\nincident a laptop computer was\nfound discarded in a bathroom\nwhen the thief was scared off.\nPHOTO: WILLIAM LORENTZ\n\"Sarah Sucks Spirit from Sleazy Sex Serfs\".

Good. Do you want to\nstay that way? Then don't listen to this album.\nYes, those Seattle gloom-meisters, Alice in\nChains, are back with their most impressively\ndepressive offering yet. Where 1992's bona fide\nclassic album, 'Dirt', was the fallout from the\nband's smack explosions and 1994's incredibly\nmellow 'Jar of Flies' was purely the result of too\nmuch pot, the imaginatively tided follow-up\nsounds like it was recorded during a period of cold\nturkey.\nOpening number and current single, Grind',\nserves as a pre c is of the whole affair. Immense,\nbrooding guitar riffs, off-beat vocal harmonies, an\nalmost contradictory, pleasant chorus and esoteric\nlyrics of, \"In the darkest hole you'd be well\nadvised not to plan my funeral before the body\ndies\", all combine for maximum morose magni-tude. You certainly wouldn't want to invite this\nband to a party. Not unless it's a funeral party that\nis.\nBut that's not to say that this isn't worthy of\nyour time. On the contrary, it's only with careful\nattention that the nuances and sub tie, mysterious\nmelodies become apparent. It's ironic that the\nmost obvious and uplifting track is the final one,\nwith the teasing lines, \"Yeah, it's over now, but I can breathe somehow.\" I for one hope that this\ndoesn't refer to the band's existence (as is strongly rumoured). I mean, where else are you going to\ngo for your lows? (7)\n- gig: buffalo to mm*. It's been forty minutes and the crowd are impatient. It's not the usual sort of crowd impatience\nthough. This sort is mixed with real excitement.\nThis crowd is not just bored of having nothing to\ndo. Instead, they positively reek of anticipation,\nwhich is not an attitude I had associated with\nBuffalo Tom before. And, to be tm th ful, this is a peculiar crowd. Most of London's gig-going community is over at Earls Court, basking in the Oasis\nlive experience. The Empire is thus half-filled\nwith real fans.\nBuffalo Tom's entrance is obscured by clapping hands and so only signalled as they quickly go\nto work. For some reason, the stage is clotted with\nlarge, plastic trophies, as if this is a prize-giving cer-emo ny. It gives the gig a faint air of kitsch which is\nweird since common wisdom pegs them firmly in\nthe country/grunge bracket - fair enough as these\nthings go, I guess. Anyway, they start, the wall at\nthe front pogo s up and down, and those at the\nback nod their heads. In short, everyone is enjoying themselves and it's still the first song.\nThey play a long-ish set, inevitably taken\nfrom the new album, 'Sleepy Eyed', and with\nprogressively fewer from 'Big Red Letter Day'\nand beyond. It's all good stuff and while Buffalo\nTom are seldom going to set your life aflame, on\noccasions they get close. 'Sunday Night' and\nAVhen You Discover' are probably two of the best\nsongs they've ever written and tonight they're\nplayed like it too.\nWhen Buffalo Tom finish, the clam our for an\nencore is furious and heartfelt. There's few\nenough bands who actually earn their return, but\nBuffalo Tom are worth every second. And they\ncome back to prove it.\n\u2022 album: Catherine wheel happy days as on Don't let the title of this album deceive you. The\nalbum cover says it all and you enter a dark and\nbrooding world of pain and pessimism. You do get\na couple of cheery moments in 'Love Tips Up'\nbut that's about all you can expect.\nIf you're on the verge of suicide, I advise you\nagainst listening to this album but then again,\nhearing someone else's rough times might be of\nsome comfort, lb whet your appetite, here are\nsome typical lyrics from 'Empty Head': \"Just\ndon't be surprised if this permanent paradise\nexplodes some day into a permanent picture of\npain.\"\n'Judy's Staring at the Sun' is one of the standout tracks on the album, capturing you with its\nsoaring guitar melody. When I listened to the\nmusic, I felt like it was a summer's day and that I was lying on a green meadow beneath a clear blue\nsky. But, as I heard the lyrics, it all turned black.\nElsewhere, 'Little Muscle' is like a rollercoaster\ntide. The verses are the slow steep climbs while\nthe chorus hurtles you along at breakneck speed.\nIf you like Soundgarden and Compulsion,\nwith al it de bit of Queen thrown in on he side, go\nout and buy this bumper value fifteen track CD.\nIt's well worth it.

Le Blanc is situated\nin the Massif Centrale, approximately 50 kilometres east of Poitiers.\nAlthough the weather was very hot and sunny, the soaring conditions were far from ideal, and so\nmuch of the time was spent swimming and canoeing in the nearby river in order to keep cool. Despite the\npoor soaring weather, two students, Andrew Fowler and Alex Borak, managed to do their Silver distance\n(a flight of 50 km or more). Andrew flew to Poitiers Airport and Alex flew to Chateauroux.\nDespite the 39\u00b0 heat, some still decided to go flying, and Mark Sadler was sent off on his first solo.\nLater in the evening, a barbecue was held. It was here that a group of visiting Dutch people showed us\nhow to do an initiation ceremony for the newly soloed. This involved a lot of tomato ketchup and beer\n{which ended up on ' ..JQ^/ \u00a3f Mark) and being held\ndown on a table while\nbeing spanked by each\nof the over friendly\nDutch contingent in\nturn. Mark's only\ncomment afterwards\nwas \"You have to pay\ngood money for that\nback home!\".\nTowards the end\nof the second week,\nthe weather improved\nslightly, and on the\nThursday Ken Bell did\nhis Silver Distance to\nIssoudun (northeast of\nChateauroux).\nOn Saturday, the weather got much better for soaring, and Jane Lewis in our AS W24 declared a300 km flight. Peter Masson and Alex Borak also set off on the 300 km in our two seat Grob 103. The task\nwas to go from Le Blanc to Poitiers Airport and then on to a river bridge in St Florent and then back to\nLe Blanc, taking photos of each turn point as they were turned.\nJane completed the flight in 5 hours (having struggled under some overcast from Chateauroux to St\nFlorent) to get her gold distance and diamond goal badges. Peter and Alex also went round in a little over\n4 hours.\nMost of us left the next morning, but Ken stayed on, as the weather was looking good, and managed\nto complete 150 km on only his second cross-country flight.\n\n"

There will\nbe posters up around college advertising which societies are on which day. Some societies will be present\nall day but the majority will be concentrating their efforts in the lunch period of 12 noon - 2pm. This is\nwhen each society will be most active.\nAs well as having the opportunity to sample the various cultures there is a chance to join any of the\nsocieties and so benefit from all of the events each respective society organises.

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 2 4 TH1995. THREE\nTribunal Dubbed a \"Witch-Hunt\"\nBY JONATHAN TROUT\nA Linstead re-app has been\nexpelled from the hall following\ndrunken behaviour during the\nnow infamous Halloween party.\nThe residents' tribunal of\nAndrew Deeley took place in the\nChemistry building last Friday\nmorning.\nBefore the tribunal it was\nwidely expected that Mr Deeley\nwould escape with a \u00a3100 fine,\nbut the weight of the charges\nbrought against him, ranging\nfrom indecent exposure to\nthreatening the life of a sub-war-den and blackmail, left no one\npresent in much doubt as to the\noutcome.\nAfter 35 minutes of de liber ation, the tribunal decided that\nMr Deeley's tenure at Linstead\nHall should be terminated,\nand his room vacated within\nseven days. In addition, he has\nbeen banned from all communal\nareas of Linstead.\nHowever, the most unexpected proceedings of the tribunal dealt with the accusations\nagainst Linstead Bar Chair Nick\nHudson. In an attempt to portray Deeley's diminished responsibility, Adam Torry, a friend of\nMr Deeley, inadvertently asked\nMr Hudson a leading question\nregarding licensing laws, specifically whether Mr Hudson had\nserved Mr Deeley a \"Green\nLizard\", an extremely alcoholic\ncocktail.\nIt transpired that he had\nindeed served a close friend of\nDeeley, knowing that the drink\nwas for him. In his defence, Mr\nHudson said that he had only\njust arrived at the bar, and did\nnot know that Mr Deeley was\nalready drunk. An independent\nobserver noted that anyone in\nthe bar could have served Mr\nDeeley that night, as he was celebrating his birthday. This\nincluded a sub-warden, who was\nallegedly seen behind the bar\nserving people whilst drunk him-self.\nThe tribunal ruled that in\nlight of this new information\nLinstead Bar was to be closed\nagain; then in a bizarre turn of\nevents it was inexplicably\nreopened in time for that night's normal 7pm start.\nNick Hudson was stripped\nof his bar duties by Earl\nLancaster that afternoon, and\nonly found out the following day\nthat his case would not be taken\nbefore a tribunal. His punishment would be decided by Dr\nLancaster, and would un doubt The enduring nature of the\nSouthside Halls of residence are\nillustrated by the remarkable\ncoincidence of one student\nbeing allocated the same room\nin hall as his father had occupied thirty years ago.\nThe top photograph, taken\nin 1967, shows the student's mother in the Tizard room a few\nyears after the hall was built.\nThis September, when dropping\nher son off at Imperial College\nto start his four year Chem Eng\ndegree, his parents took the bottom photo. However, the chair\nthe student's mother is sitting in\nthe same in both photos, with\nonly the covering having\nchanged.\nThe 'Twilight Zone' experience, as one of the re-apps\ncalled it, was emphasised by the\nfact that the only alterations to\nthe room over the years had\nbeen the addition of a carpet, a new bed and new curtains.\nSouthside Halls were originally built in the sixties as a temporary measure to house the\ngrowing numbers of students at\nIC. They were only meant to\nlast for twenty years, but are\nnow listed.\ned ly be less harsh than the tri-bun al. Fortunately, this did not\ninclude being thrown out of hall,\nbut his penalty was as severe as it\ncould be without his permanent\neviction. He was fined \u00a3100 and\nbanned from the buying, selling\nor consumption of alcohol in all\nareas of Linstead Hall. Mr\nHudson was \"shocked at the\nCollege's reaction\", but some\nhave remarked that, unlike Mr\nDeeley, his good relationship\nwith the warden saved him from\na worse fate.\nThe doctor was reluctant to\ncomment on last week's events,\nsaying that such matters are not\nfor public discourse. Others present were not so happy with the\nresult, one labelling it as a 'witch-hunt' and another as an\nunfair 'kangaroo court'.\nBikes for BMS\nBY DIPAK G HO SH Temporary bike sheds are to be\nbuilt during the construction of\nthe Basic Medical Science build-ing, but plans for permanent bike\nsheds for the BMS students have\nyet to be finalised.\nAt present, the bike sheds\nare scattered around the college,\nbut the bike shed for the BMS\nwill be the result of \"an integrated approach\" according to\nCollege Facilities manager\nValerie Straw, who is responsible for buildings planning at IC.\nMm\nFurthermore, car-parks are to be\nre-located to another site. Mrs\nStraw also said that this temporary bike shed will be safe for\nstudents during the const ruc tion.\nStudents concerned for the\nsafety of their bikes may want to\nhave them coded for free next\nweek in the Sherfield anteroom,\nbetween 10am and 4pm. PC\nClive Coleman will be on hand\nto discuss any aspects of crime\nprevention around college.\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN\n\n"

The\nSun said that the death of Leah Betts was a tragedy and no-one deserved to lose a child\nlike that. I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but the sub- wm m^se que nt deluge of moralistic j jr knee-jerk reactions were\nnothing more than brainwashed propaganda written\nby journalists who have probably never seen an E before,\nlet alone taken one.\nSo what is Ecstasy? In a decent strength pure tablet\nthere should be 100-150mg of MDMA (n methyl 3, 4\nmethylene di oxy amp heta mine); in reality there is sometimes\nMDEA, MDA, speed, caffeine... you name\nit. Ingesting such a tablet of MDMA\ninduces euphoria, empathy and greatly\nincreased tactile sensation. It is not physically addictive but prolonged regular use\ndoes bring on a tolerance. This is because of\na depletion of ser at on in levels in the brain,\nwhich can leave you feeling depressed.\nTaking a break of at least a month or two\nbefore taking it again is advisable.\nI don't think MDMA is psychologically addictive as such, but the scene that goes\nwith it can be. The feeling you get with an\nE, in a club with a thousand like-minded\nsouls is absolutely amazing, possibly the\nbest in the world. However, it can all seem\na bit fake afterwards and the next day you\nare left feeling rather spaced out (partly\ndue to over-exercise). As Jarvis Cocker\nputs it \"I seem to have left an important\npart of my brain somewhere, somewhere in\na field in Hampshire.\" Having said that, a good night's sleep will sort you out and I don't think it is a very dangerous drug, certainly less so than speed.\nWhy then is MDMA a class A drug ^\n(the same as crack and heroin) and speed\nin class B? Speed is physically and psychologically addictive and can really mess you\nup, but is considered by the government to\nbe less harmful than MDMA, which they\ncontinually refuse to test to see how safe it\nis. In 1977 MDA and all it's analogues were\nmade illegal. I can understand\nwhy MD A was banned\nbecause its pretty nasty stuff\nwith a low toxic dose, but\nthere was no real evidence to\noutlaw MDMA in the first\nplace.\nMichael Howard and his\ncronies are keen to stamp out\nEcstasy, the scourge of\ntoday's youth, but in actual\nfact E is helping to keep crime\nfigures down. The more people there are in clubs taking E and being\nnice to each other, the fewer there are in\npubs starting fights.\nEven though we approach the twenty-first century the government's attitude\ntowards drugs remains blinkered and self-righteous in the extreme. To me, it stinks\nof tabloid politics.\nBy lain Bailie .\nFilmsoc Presents...\nDoors open 15 minutes before time stated.\nICU Cinema is no smoking but drinks from\nDa Vinci's bar are welcome.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 24TH1995 please!\nAt Imperial, 90% of the population drink\nsocially; 5% are teetotal; and 5% have a drinking problem. Of the 90% of social\ndrinkers, many will at some time in their\nlives fall into the category of problem\ndrinkers and will need to take steps to control their drinking.\nA \"drinking problem\" can be defined in\nseveral ways:\n\u2022 Drinking in excess of the recommended\nWEEKLY limits of 14 units for women and\n21 units for men. (The difference is due to\ndifferences in body weight and fat con-tent).\n\u2022 Having a dependence on alcohol so that\nyou can't get through the day without a drink.\n\u2022 When drinking habits interfere with your\nwork, family and relationships with friends.\nAs students most of us drink socially,\nbut do you realise how much you drink?\nRemember 14 units a week is the same as 7\npints of lager. So girls, if you drink a couple\nof glasses of wine with a meal on Monday\nand two pints of lager after sport on\nWednesday, the safe amount to drink over\nthe weekend would be 4 pints or 8 glasses\nof wine. It would be very easy to exceed\nthe limit if there was a party on Saturday.\nBoys can only safely drink 1.5 pints a day '\n- another target that is easy to exceed if you\ndon't count the empty glasses!\nIf you would like more information\nabout alcohol use pick up a leaflet from the\nAdvice Unit or your G.P. If you would like help with a drinking\nproblem there are lots of support groups\navailable\nDrinkline 0171 332 0202\nAlcohol Concern 0171 833 3471\nAlcoholics Anonymous 0171 352 3001\nEnjoy alcohol, don't abuse it.\nRichard Bow ker Welfare Rep. 5 MH M55Ud own? Here are a few medical facts:\n\u2022 Alcohol is a very addictive drug.\nExcessive alcohol in the long term causes;\n\u2022 Impotence & infertility (not a bad thing\nwith some people)\n\u2022 Liver cirrhosis\nij \u2022 Brain damage (how can you tell?)\nI \u2022 Life threatening gastric bleeding\n\u2022 Premature death (as opposed to dying\non time?)\nj Excessive alcohol in the short term causes;\n\u2022 Loss of bodily functions (except for your\nmouth)\n\u2022 Life threatening behaviour (such as calling Tim Townend a poof)\n\u2022 Painful vomiting (you feel better afterwards though)\n\u2022 Inhaling your own vomit (and other\nnasty substances like nicotine)\n\u2022 Respiratory depression, coma and then\ndeath, (ooh, joy!)\nI cut down Some simple methods can help us to cut\ndown the total amount we drink without\ndecreasing the fun we have with friends:\n\u2022 Keep a drinking diary\n\u2022 Knowing how much you drink and with\nwhom can help you cut out that pint or\nglass of wine that wasn't really necessary.\n\u2022 Choose a low-alcohol or non-alcoholic\ndrink sometimes.\n\u2022 You don't need a drink to enjoy yourself.\n\u2022 Pace your drinking throughout the\nevening.\n\u2022 Slow your drinking down.\n\u2022 Buy half pints or interrupt alcohol with\nnon-alcoholic drinks\n\u2022 If you are drunk stop drinking! Those\nextra pints won't improve you enjoyment\nof the evening.\n\u2022 Choose when you are going to drink\n\u2022There are lots of other places to social is e other than the bar\n8. On a day trip to France you bring back:\na) a model of the Eiffel Tower\nb) as much drink as you can carry\nc) as much drink as the ferry can carry\n9. You favourite watering hole is:\na) Linstead Bar\nb) Union Bar or Southside Bar\nc)I can never remember where I drink...\n10. Sex on the beach is:\na) sandy and un hy geni cb)a good idea!\nc) better with Jack Daniels and Malibu\nNow check your answers for the verdict...\nMostly As:\nYou either don't drink at all or drink only in\nsmall quantities. You'd rather be doing work\n- after all, that's why you're at university.\nWho wants to spend all their cash on booze\nanyway? You are a typical Imperial Student.\nMostly B's: You like the odd drink or two, but you know\nwhere your limits are. But what did happen\nat the Fresher's Frolik? You are a typical\nImperial student.\nMostly C's: You eat your cornflakes covered with\nBoddington's. Less than five pints a night is\nfor losers only. You like playing [insert sport\nhere] because they have such great drinking\ngames. Work? That's lifting the pint to your\nmouth. You are a typical Imperial Student.\nA,B and C for all questions:\nYou are beyond hope. You drink like a fish\nand when you're not drinking, you're unconscious. You are probably ICU Deputy\nPresident for Clubs and Socs (any year).\nMark Baker and Tim St.Clair\n\n"
