    "content": "The Italian Job Competitions! Director: Peter Coliinson\nStarring: Michael Caine, Noel\nCoward and Benny Hill.\nHold on, this isn'ta new\nrelease,\" I hear you mutter\nunder your breath. And indeed my\nlittle observant cherubs you are\nnot mistaken, for The Italian Job\nwas actually released in 1969.\nHowever, it is the first film in the\n\"After Dark\" series appropriately\nnamed because they are shown\nquite late at the BFI IMAX cinema\nin Waterloo.\nYou've probably heard enough of\nmy ranting s about how impressive\nthe IMAX cinema in Waterloo is. It\nis encased in an odd cylindrical\nshaped building, interestingly positioned in the middle of a round-about, which jumps out at you\nafter you keep following the South\nBank signs out of the underground.\nHowever, once you've negotiated\nthe subways and hand over your\ngood money, you are submerged in\nan media experience that only the\nbest cinema in Britain can give\nyou.\nUsually such films as The Italian\nJob are not usually shown because\nthey are not IMAX, and hence do\nnot show off the cinema's true\npotential. However, due to public\ndemand, such classic films are\nbeing shown, a year after the first\nwere tried. Just because of the\nsheer size of the screen and steep\ninclination at which you are positioned, watching a film in such an\nenvironment is a totally different\nexperience. The Italian Job is\nsupremely enjoyable, those little\nminis scooting all over the giant\nscreen, in what must be one of the\nfilms that defined the cool Britannia image of the 1960's. Also, with the opening of the\nWellcome Wing at the Science Museum, IC students can see features previously reviewed in Felix\nfor the m easily sum of \u00a3 5 . 9 5\n(remember actual entry is free) at\nthe IMAX now residing there. However, the \"After Dark\" series\nis only shown at the BFI IMAX, and\nbe warned, it sells out very quickly\nindeed. The \"After Dark\" series is\nshown only on the last weekend of\nthe month. All of the next films are\nall heartily recommended.\nTitanic - 29th,30 th Dec.\nLA Confidential - 26th,27 th Jan.\nGoodFellas - 23th,24 th Feb.\nPulp Fiction - 30th,31 st March\nYes everybody, once again it is\ncompetition time and this week\nour good pals at the Odeon on\nHigh Street Kensington have given Screen two pairs of tickets\nfor Urban Legends: Final Cut.

    "content": "The mountain medic: Hypothermia MATT KAPLAN Considering the fact that last week's Felix\nfocused on campus medical care I only think it\nappropriate that we explore the question of\nwilderness medical care here in the science sec-tion. So this is the first of several articles which\nwill consider what to do when the forever valiant\nDr. Weinreb and her team of talented physicians\nare not available to tackle urgent problems that\ndevelop when you are far away from medical\ncare facilities.\nSo you might ask, what the hell does the science editor of Felix know about wilderness med-i cine? Well for starters let me be very clear that\nI am NOT a doctor, I am what in America is\ncalled an emergency medic (I think you call them\nparamedics here in Britain). Anyhow, I started\nmy training on ambulance rigs and eventually\nstarted work placement in the triage division of\nthe Sacramento California emergency room. I worked with a lot of urban injuries, stabbings,\nautomobile accidents, drug addictions, and quite\na lot of gun shot injuries (silly gun legislation in\nthe states). Eventually I got interested in doing\nback country search and rescue, it seemed a lot\nmore exciting to me, and I upgraded my medical\ntraining through several module courses to\ninclude wilderness medicine. I have now worked\nas the medical director of the Royal Gorge Wilderness Medical Lodge in Lake Tahoe, Ca., as the medic for several river rafting expeditions\non the American River (I myself am a rafting\nguide), and as the\nmedic on multiple\nbackpacking treks\nin U.S. national\nparks.\nBut enough about my training,\nlets get talking about neat stuff\nlike environment\ninduced hypo the r mia, lightning\nstrikes, drownings,\nand trauma. The\nbest way to communicate how to\ndeal with such situations is also perhaps the most\ninteresting, and\nthis is through the\ntelling of a few stories. Names in my stories\nhave been changed for purposes of privacy.\nWith the winter holidays just around the corner\nit seems appropriate to consider cold illness this\nweek, so lets talk hypothermia.\nI was trekking through Yellowstone National\nPark with five friends\nduring mid October| nearly two years ago. The weather had been cool, but\nabove freezing during the day time and\nwell below freezing\nat night. On our fj lf fourth night in the\nback country we\nunloaded our packs\nto set up camp and Ij\nnoticed that one\nmember of our\ngroup, Jane, started\nacting a bit... re clu sive. As I watched\nher behaviour, I grew\nmore and more con-cern ed, she just did-n't look right. It's not\nthat \"reclusive ness\" on its own is indicative of\nsome sort of medical problem, however the\npresence of a behavioural change certainly is. I didn't do anything at the time, and in retrospect I should have been more vigilant, because nearly\ntwo hours later when I was heating up a kettle\nof water for some coffee I watched as Jane was\nhelped out of her tent by her boyfriend, Mark.\nShe was quivering uncontrollably, having terrible\ndifficulty mano eu ve ring, and slurring some of her\nspeech. I had only read about moderate hypothermia in class, but I instantly knew that\nthis was it. Mark placed her by the fire and\nencouraged her to try to warm up, it didn't work.\nThe ambient temperature was well below freezing and the fire was not large enough to do her a bit of good, it was then that I stepped in.\nBefore I go any further I should comment or the different types of hypothermia. There are three major categories; mild, moderate, and severe. Mild hypo the rm ics tend to be a bit disoriented , cool to the touch, uncoordinated, ait\nusually shiver. Moderate hypo the r mic sar ever j cold to the touch, shiver lots, often notice a fci mentally altered, and have terrible trouble mo \u00bb\n-ng around. Severe hypothermia is a critics1 emergency which needs to be dealt will\nextreme care, I 'll explain this in greater de tar later. Now there are a lot of different methods]\nof dealing with mild and moderate hypo the cs in the wilderness, but there is a central theme|\nGET THEM WARM! This may sound simple, bj\nwhen you are out in freezing temperatures wit!\nno shelter around this is not always an e as j task.\nI brought Jane back inside her tent and I Mark put her in a sleeping bag. I collected s or m water bottles, filled them with the warm \u00ab \u2022\nfrom the kettle which was on the fire, and p\"| pared to make what is so eloquently known as\nhuman burrito. I took a warm water bottle a placed it inside the sleeping bag and wrapped'\nup against the bottoms of Jane's feet, wrap P*| another one up in her hand, closed up the\nand stuck a couple of wool hats on her I considered sticking her boyfriend in the s\\( bag with her, after all, we humans make ma^J lou s heaters (and he was certainly hap Pj jump in) but I decided aqa in st it. I did J because I was concerned about Jane 0\n,1\nthe heat out of Mark and did not want to en 1\nin re^\nhaving two hypo the rm ics on my hands. ln J but th*J sleeps.\nspec tI think it would have been fine,\nwas no need to risk it since I had warm\nwater i Science \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Felix*\n\n"

    "content": "Singles by Tom, War ul,M an so or and Stephen Saian Supa Crew\nAngela\n(Wordplay/Source)\nFantastic single from this French HipHop collective. The soulful lyrics combine superbly with SSC' s trademark\nskillful vocal dexterity. There's even\nsome Latin vibes going on here. Angela was in the French Top 5 for\nfour weeks over the Summer, and it's great. Get this now!\nLast Man Standing |\nShotgun Mouth\n(Stand Alone Recordings))\nAhhh, what's that in my ears?!?!? Is it\na bee, or a wasp?!?!? No! It's this\nsong! Super-fuzzy bass and dist or tion, they sound like angry teenagers,\nand aren't teenagers so adorable when they're angry...This isn't bad,\nprobably worth seeing live. What is a Shotgun Mouth?\nBon Jovi 1\nThank You For Loving!\nMe I( Jambco)\nI had heard that Bon Jovi' s latest\nalbum Crush was a welcome, rousing\nrevisit to their pop rock roots. However, this single from their album\nis a barely warmed-over rehash of\nthe track Always from the album\nCrossroads. This is a rather simple,\nsappy ballad. Strictly for fans only.\nBig Sur\nEP\n(Arista)\nThis is a bit more like it - one of the\nhundreds of 'next big things' flying\nabout at the moment, it comes across like Belle and Sebastian, except it's not wank. Wistful guitar\npop of the type that Buffalo Tom do\nso well, with the third track, Waiting\nFor You being especially good.\nIBarker\njT rec co Bay EP\ni( Clearsound)\nThis lot seem to have missed their\ntime by about 5 years - mid-90's indie pop, in a Northern Uproar/ Menswear style. Not anything you haven't heard before, and\nit all sounds a bit dated now.\nApollo 440\nCharlie's Angels\n(Sony)\nTypical Apollo 440 fare - the drummer having a fit in the background,\na few guitars thrown in for good\nmeasure, and completely devoid of\nany semblance of being good. Not\nas bad as Lost In Space, but then\nthat's not much of an achievement.\nLo-fidelity Allstars, supported by Space Raiders\n@ Heaven\nHaving lost two band members, including their vocalist, around\ntime of their last UK tour two years ago, you might think that the Lo-Fi Allstars have difficulty returning to the stage with the same\npresence that they used to have. However their explosive performance on the final date of their recent UK tour blew away any doubts\nyou might have had about the band. The raucous, adrenal in filled se:\nwas a statement of intent as the band made clear that they were as loud and as energetic as they have ever been, and that \"this is NOT;\ncomeback\".\nSpace Raiders supported, and camped it up in Village People out-fits. The two frontmen made an enthusiastic duo, who were perhaps i little too lively for the crowd, but all in all not a bad performance.\nLo-Fi Allstars came on and showcased their \"new sound\" - wh ict seemed to have elements of Primal Scream, Death In Vegas anc Bentley Rhythm Ace - with a good selection of their new tracks such\nas The All and Voodoo House. They also played old tracks such as Battle Flag and Disco Machine Gun. This good mix of old and new] meant that the fans were kept happy whilst also being introduced tt\nthe new material, all of which was played with the same full-on at ti tude.\nHowever, I found that the new material lacked some of the dark.i psychotic feel that made their last album so damn good. None of their\nseemed to have a distinctive sound. In a sense it felt as if they hac|\nlost some of their identity.\nBut hey, that was the past, what about now? Now, they have j more than enough talent and musical firepower to beat the s eve' j shades of shoeshine out of most of the wh me yar sed bands around a'| the moment. Their eclectic mix of styles and moods means that the'l music is always fresh and exciting, and ultimately powerful.

    "content": "joy disposal. I must stress this point, using\nother people to warm a patient can be very\neffective, but you must be careful and use common sense in making this decision. Do not ever\nput yourself in a position where you end up creating a second patient!\nJane warmed up within less than an hour,\nslurped up some warm broth, and ended up finishing the trip without a problem. But what if\nshe had been suffering from severe hypo the r mia? What would she have looked like and how\nwould it have been treated? Well, if severely\nhypo the r mic, Jane would never have left her\ntent, even with Mark's assistance. She would\nnot have been able to speak at all and would not\nbe aware of the environment around her. She would have been as cold as a river rock and definitely boasting an unhealthy skin colour (a lovely bluish/purple). Her heart and breathing rate\nwill have slowed a lot, and if a pulse is taken she\nmay even appear dead.\nScary huh? As I stated earlier, severe hypothermia is a critic a I medical emergency\nand it does not get emergency\nsolved in the back country. You should not move\na severe hypo the r mic nor should you try to\nre warm them (constructing a shelter around\nthem is certainly advisable if possible). There\nare a lot of reasons for this, the most important\nII\nof which is that\nwith dropping temp era ture s the\nbody's systems get\na bit fragile and shaking a severe hypo the r mic around\ncould lead to car- |$\ndia c arrest (definitely bad).\nYou solve severe\nhypothermia by\ngetting help via mobile phone, radio, flares, smoke, or by hiking\nto the closest medical centre( obviously not a good option if you are several days away\nfrom such a place).

Speed is not\nthe critical factor in the rescue effort so much\nas steady and gentle management of the\nhypo the r mic patient. We like to think of severe\nhypo the rm ics as panes of glass that easily shat-ter.\nSo that's hypothermia in a nutshell.

Some of my\nfriends, for example, seem to think\nthat Star Trek is brilliant, when it is\nquite clearly not.\nRegards,\nAlec Thomas (Physics III)\nCYCLE III\nDear Felix,\nread with interest the recent pieces\nin your magazine covering cycle\ntheft\nand bike parking.\nI just took a quick stroll in order to\nassess the number of cyclists on the\nSouth Ken. campus. I counted around 400 cycles locked outside;\nthe majority of these could be found\nwithin 10 or so 'designated locations'\nspread around the site. These cycle\nparks were all in heavy use (80% full,\nsay) except for the very large site\noutside electrical engineering which\nwas about 60% empty. Since this\nempty cycle park is very close to\nDalby Ct. it suggests that a large\nnew bike shed here would not be\nideally placed.\nBesides, I would think that the total\nJUST PLAIN INSANE\narea taken up by the (very cramped)\ncycle parks approaches 750 square\nmeters; this would take up a significant chunk of Dalby Ct. Presumably\nthis would make a central cycle storage facility impractical as well as\nundesirable.\nSo if anything is done to improve the\ncycle parking facilities, I would argue\nthat it should be mirrored at a number of locations around the campus.\nSurely the least we can hope for is\nsome well-spaced Sheffield racks\nwith a CCTV camera trained on\nthem.\nWhat about something better? I suspect that because the existing\ncycle parking is located in awkward\nnooks and crannies that it would be\ndifficult to implement lockers or\nbuild secure compounds at the existing locations. I would think that if\ncollege are serious about improving\ncycle parking facilities, they might\nneed to allocate some better space\nto cycle parking. Perhaps college\nshould carry out a proper feasibility\nstudy examining the requirements\nfor cycle parking and the options\navailable. This might include a survey of how people get to college. I suspect this would reveal that more\npeople cycle than drive which would\nhelp to justify their expenditure and\nloss of any car parking spaces.\nBesides improving parking facilities\nmaybe college could be persuaded\nto\nappoint a cycling officer. This would\nprovide a focus for cyclists and\nreduce the apathy which Hamish\nreferred to. I would guess that the\ncycling population of the South\nKensington campus will approach\n10% in the summer months (if there\nare 400 cycles parked on campus on\na November lunchtime, then including bikes hidden away in peoples\noffices, cyclists not on campus and\nthe increased use of cycles in sum-mer, this number should rise consid-era bly). Surely 700 or so cyclists deserve\nsome form of recognition. For\nexample it would be nice for someone to organise discounted bike\nmaintenance schemes or to represent the interests of cyclists to the\nRoyal Parks or to the London\nBorough of Kensington and\nChelsea.\nFinally, I agree with Hamish that\nthere is nothing particularly difficult\nin achieving improved cycle parking\nif the political will is there and would\nurge Hamish to ensure that something does happen.\nYours,\nTim Grainger\nTHE BIOCHEMISTRY\nBETWEEN US Dear all,\nI wish to inform the students from all\nsubjects about the exciting Guest\nLectures organised in the coming\nweeks by the Biochemistry Society.\nThe first lecture takes place on\nThursday 7th December and is presented by the world famous scientist\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston.\nThe lecture entitled 'Ethics in\nScience' asks whether scientists\nshould be held accountable for the\nscience they create.

For those of\nyou who Have only joined us this year, allow me to\ndescribe to you this strange beast.\nPart rice, part spice and part miscellaneous meat\nor ve g, the Union Curry has been a staple foodstuff for generations of IC students. Nutritious\nand occasionally delicious, the Union Curry provided the IC student with their daily dosage of\ncarbohydrates, proteins, fat and baby sweet corn Specially baby sweet corn). Every lunch and dinner time, there was a choice\nbetween the visually attractive vegetable curry or\n, ne clearly labelled but otherwise unidentifiable\n^eat curry. They were cheap and cheerful and\nn| ce in their own special way, and never failed to\ns Park off a conversation speculating on the exact\norigin of various components of these culinary\nmasterpieces. There seemed to be no limits to\nwhat qualified to become the basis for a Union\nCurry. Peas, carrots, lamb, mushrooms, potatoes,\nturkey, baby sweet corn( and something that we\nare fairly sure was parsnip (you're not even close\n-Ed) ) ail made it into the mix.\nThey weren't haute cuisine, but they were ours\nand we liked them. And union catering has cut us\noff cold turkey. Citing financial constraints (the\nUnion Curry was a loss making venture apparent-ly, but what could be cheaper to produce than a curry?), they have killed the curry and replaced it\nwith daily specials. I am all for choice, but what\nabout those of us who want to choose curry?\nMore to the point, how's a student supposed to\nprepare for a night on the beers with a baguette\nor a jacket potato?\nWell some of us have decided that the time has\ncome to take action. We have launched an online\npetition at www.icu-curries.com, demanding the\nreturn of the Union Curry. Our hope is that with\nenough signatures, union catering will reverse\ntheir decision and bring it back. Why should you\nsign it?. Because you too want to see the return\nof the glorious Union Curry of course! But we\nalso have an added incentive...\nWin beer. There, I said it\nAfter hearing of our plight, the nice folks at Cobra\nBeer have offered to supply not a bottle, not a crate, but an entire YEARS SUPPLY of Cobra\nBeer to the IC student who comes up with the\nmost original and compelling argument to bring\nback the Union Curry. So don't delay, register\nyour vote today at www.icu-curries.com - and\ndon't forget to tell your friends.\nGot something to rant about?

The simple reason for this is\nthat I 've decided to take a break from London\nand come to the relative peace and quiet\nwhich is New York City.\nHaving never been abroad before it was\nquite an experience on the British Airways\nflight to JFK, the food was edible and only\nonce or twice did I imagine us plummeting\nmo the Atlantic Ocean. One small point, if\nyou're on an airplane which crashes what use\nis a little whistle and torch (unless you happen to crash into a disco or club I guess).\nAfter a7 hour\nflight, my first moments on they carry guns! American soil were spent going through customs, waiting\nhalf an hour for my luggage (the excuse being\nthat the cargo doors would not open due to\nthe cold weather) and staring at the airport\npolice-officers thinking \"this is so like te levi sion, they really carry Guns!\"\nAfter a quick bus ride (the time by now was\napproaching midnight) I had my first experience of the NY subway. First point, I was\nscared, it was late and I was travelling\nthrough Brooklyn. Secondly, it makes the\nLondon Underground look like Virgin's First\nclass train carriages. The NY subway is dis-gusting, the stations look like level one of\nHuxley and the trains (which do run through\nthe night) are very infrequent. The price is\nfair though, $1.50 for any journey regardless\nof where it's to.\nAfter a goodnight s sleep in the hostel\n(saving money to spend on shopping) on top\n\u00b0fa bunk bed (that was an experience and a half) it was time to do New York.\nFirst things first, I went to Times SquareSroadway (a sight which during the day is\nlm press ive but is spectacular at night) and\nb \u00b0oke da show (well three to be precise),\nforbidden Broadway on Sunday evening,\nphantom on Monday and Jekyll and Hyde\nStarring David Hasselhoff, you know the one\n\u00b0 ut of Bay-watch, the one without the large\n9'and s) on Tuesday. Most of Saturday was\ns Pent walking (so much more of an eye-open-er than taking the subway everywhere) round going \"Oh, I recognise that\" or looking\nat my pop up map( I so love playing the\ntourist).\nSunday morning I got up early and proceeded downtown to South Ferry. From there\nI took the free ferry to Staten Island which\ngives an excellent view of the Statue of\nLiberty on the outward journey and of the NY skyline on the way back. As it was misty and\nraining the sight of Lady Liberty was one I 'll\nnever forget, no wonder this symbol is such a source of comfort and hope to so many in\nthis country.\nThat evening Forbidden Broadway was excellent. For those who don't know, FB is a humourous look at the mus c ical s and shows\nThiS iS SO like television, bY parodying the music\nHand stars. The service and food\nin the theatre( the Ellen Stardust) was superb, my bill only\ncame to just over $1 1 but I gave $15 (I never\nknow what to tip and I'm such a sucker for a dashing and charming waiter).\nBefore coming to New York, some people\ntold me that the people in shops and restaurants were rude and unfriendly. I have found\nthis to be untrue . What I have witnessed is\nthat if you say\" Thankyou\" the common response is a smile and\" Your welcome\". Showing, that if your pleas\nant to them they are cordial\nback.\nThe usual tourist things have followed: The\nWorld Trade Center( which holds probably\nthe best Borders there is, oh and two big\nsky scrapes), Wall Street( no big deal, a rather inferior Bank Of England/ Thread needleS t), Rocker feller Center( I have found that I can't skate and\nmy ass will be hurting for weeks), Macy s and\nBloomingdales (Macys is the largest shop in\nthe world but I thought it looked like a large\nbranch of Debenhams, men will hate it,\nwomen (because of the per fu m and smelly\nstuff) will love it).\nA bit about books. New york does indeed\nhave a number of very impressive books shops and smaller specialist ones. Barnes and Nobles is the main chain, a bit like our\nWaterstones, and like Waterstones can be a II\nbit hit and miss. Some branches are excellent\nwith a wide range but some (especially the so\ncalled \"largest book shop on earth\" on 5th avenue) could be selling socks for the amount\nof interest it generates for book fans( Waterstones on Piccadilly, I hope your listening the same goes for you!). Specialists\nand second-hand places are everywhere but I do want to mention one,\" Mysterious Bookshop\" on 56th street has everything for\nthe thriller and crime fiction fan (i.e. me), the\nmember of staff was so pleasant I wanted to\ntake her home with me.\nNew York is very expensive. The shows on\nBroadway are almost double what you would\npay in the WestEnd, junk food and restaurants are unbelievable priced but electrical\ngoods are very cheap, A word of warning, all\nprices in New York are without tax (8.5%) so\nbe careful, the price on the label is not the\nprice your'l! be paying.\nBe careful of the toilets especially the\nflushes they are very powerful, I only mention\nthis because I lost a very nice silver pen in\nBorders and before I realised it had fell out of\nmy pocket it was probably being sucked into\nthe Brooklyn river.\nIn my eyes NY is a great city, but for me\nOnce yOU Ve Seen ten London has the edge \u201e l \u201e . . ' . \u2022 m London has more\nskyscrapers you ve \u2022\nJ m history (which is\nreflected in our\nbuildings and parks) and\nNew York tries to compensate with sky scrapes and impressive constructions; for\nsome it works but for me once you've seen 10\nsky scrapes you've seen them all (I won't be\napplying for my green card yet, the chances\nare I wouldn't get it anyway). New York( especially around the theatre district and up\nto central park south) is like the area around\nTottenham Court Rd and Centre Point, very\nnice in some areas but it has a slight dirty\nluck and too much neon lighting can be rather\ntacky.\nI have to get going now. I have a red Yankees baseball hat to find and I have to\nthink up away of bringing about 40 to 50\nbooks back with me. I will return next week\nwith more book reviews if they let me back in\nthe country.\nJonathan Matthews\nseen them all Books \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Felix\n\n"

    "content": "NEE w feTO KNOW BSE: Not just a British problem NINA DE ROY Fears over mad cow disease have resurfaced in Europe this week, this time with France's cattle coming under the spot light. Concern about the safety\nof French beef products has been growing, following a recent\nsurge in the number of BSE infected cattle and CJ D related\ndeaths, amongst the human pop-ul ation. So far, vets have registered100 cases of BSE in French herds this year, many of which\nwere recorded in the Normandy region, where the French Prime\nMinister Lionel Jospin was trying\nto calm public fears. In a statement to the French parliament,\nhe later announced stricter controls for livestock feed and called\nfor a temporary ban on the sale\nof T bone steaks. His proposals\nhave since been echoed by senior EU officials who insist that\nthese measures should be intro-duce d, not just to France, but to\nall of the15 European Union member states as well. Europe's food safety commissioner: Mr David Byrne told journalists at a Brussels news conference: there has been concern in my mind as to the controls relating\nto meat and bone meal( MB M) in\nanimal feed. I have put forward\nproposals that are essential for\nthe enhancement of consumer confidence.\" Sales of beef in\nFrance, alone have slumped by\nas much as 50% and some count ries such as Italy and Switzerland have gone for an all\nout ban of certain French meat\nproducts, until they have sufficient evidence that they are safe\nfor human consumption.\nHowever France is not alone in\nfacing speculation over the health of\nit's cattle. Spain has already\nreported it's first two cases of\nthe disease and Germany is\ndescribed as having been plunged into a state of shock by\nlast week's discovery that BSE has now landed on it's shores. Just a week ago the German government was insisting that no\nBSE actually existed in the co un try. This statement has since been retracted and now German\nfarmers are helplessly watching\ntheir beef market evaporate before\ntheir eyes. Politicians in the country appear to be doing little\nto appease the quarter of a million Germans that rely upon cattle farming for their livelihood. In\na national announcement, German Health Minister Andrea\nfisher advised people to stick to\norganic beef only-thus encouraging them to reject the remaining\n9 5 % of the meat reared on\nGerman farms. Oman and other\nMiddle Eastern countries were quick to follow suit, they have\nannounced a ban on all beef imports (with the exception of\nmilk) from France,\nIreland, Portugal and Switzerland. Similar precautions\nare also being considered by\nother Gulf States and Greece. In\na desperate attempt to calm the\nescalating situation, ministers from the 15 EU nations met for a gruelling 16 hours of talks to discuss growing fears over what the\ncommission called \"disturbing\"\nlevels of BSE, in France in part icu lar. They have since prop o sed new tests, designed to\ntarget older animals that have\nnot been covered by the existing\nsafety checks. These are expected to come into force from as\nearly as today and each test is\nestimated to cost around \u00a320 per\ncow. This may seem rather expensive; given the large number of cattle that will have to be\nscreened however the com mis sion insists the price is worth it,\nin order to give consumers an\nextra safety guarantee for the\nbeef that they buy. A spokesman\nfor the EU commissioner, David\nByrne, said: \"He\nconsiders it essential that in\nthe current circumstances were view the implementation of\nBSE controls\".\nAnalysts say that there is a strong chance both of these proposals will be accepted by the\nmember states, and countries outside the EU, such as Poland,\nwill ha.ve to set up their own monitoring bodies if they wish to\ncontinue exporting cattle and meat products to Europe.\nHere in the UK, the PrimeMinister has apparently been warned that Britons could be eating French beef, infected with\nBSE. In a letter, published in the\nTimes, Tony Blair was told by the\nAgricultural minister, Nick Brown, that meat from older ani-mals, reared in France, could find\nit's way on to the UK market!\nOfficials from the UK Foo\nStandards Agency have beer,\nsent over there in order to seel|\nassurances from the French govt\nern ment that BSE infected meat]\nunsuitable for sale on the French\nmarket, will not be finding it?\nway onto our shelves. They an\nsaid to want proof that contain\nnate d meat is not being allowes j to reenter the food chain\nInterestingly however, and cor f tr ary to the wishes of man),\nopposition party members, bot t| our government and the FSAi\nhave rejected calls for a tempo]\nra ryb an on French beef prod-iu ct s, claiming that there is I scientific reason for them to 1\nso. As the FSA chairman him se'1 put it, in a recent interview cBBC Radio4, \"This year 1\nBritain we have over 1,000\ncases of BSE as compared 1\nonly 100 in France. Their n#b ers are simply going upa\nfl ours are going down, but we HI\nhave more. Our position is t^'l the risk from imported meat ^ \\\nmeat products should not ^1\ngreater than the risk fry domestic meat and meat pr 0\nIu ct s.\" \u2022 m News \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

It's a collection of original artwork, verse and fiction by students. In short, Phoenix\noffers an outlet for your repressed creative talents! Besides, it provides entertainment and welcome relief from science, technology and medicine.\nPhoenix is special because it represents over a century of college\ntradition. The arts annual is the oldest publication at IC, founded once\nupon a time by the celebrated alumnus H.G. Wells. So this is your\nopportunity to be a part that distinguished history.\nOver the years, Phoenix has been produced in a variety of formats by\nsuccessive elected editors. The incredible range of styles is a definite\nbonus - as the saying goes, variety is the spice of life. There is purposefully no specific theme to Phoenix 2001, so your piece can be on whatever subject inspires you the most. Just let your imagination run wild.\nSubmitting entries couldn't be simpler, either via e mail (for poe rti j and stories) or in person (for drawings and pictures to be scanned;\nPhoenix is based in the Felix office, those unmistakable porta cab irp behind the liquid nitrogen tank at the back of the Physics depart\nment.\nThe preliminary deadline for submissions is set for the beginning $\nnext term (Wednesday 10th January), so there's still plenty of time to be creative during the holidays. If all goes according to schedule, tha\nPhoenix should hopefully be printed around Easter. The magazine wi|\nbe distributed across campus and available for free.\nPhoenix 2001 needs: POETRY, PROSE, DRAWINGS, SHORT SToj\nRIES, ARTY PHOTOGRAPHS and of course a FRONT COVER!

A late November\nweekend in the Peak District (not exactly known for its arid\ndesert climate) after the wettest Autumn in centuries was\nunlikely to offer much in the way of perfect grit stone conditions. If dry\ngrit is the nicest thing in the world, then wet grit is definitely up for the\nworst.\nStill, that didn't deter us. After a reasonably pleasant minibus journey\nwe arrived in Hathersage Village Hall before midnight, and crashed out in\nits relative luxury (relative to a tent on a windswept hillside, anyway).\nSaturday looked worrying ly grey, but since it wasn't actually raining\nwe made it out of bed reasonably early and headed down to Hathersage\nBakery, the focal point of any Peaks trip due to its impressive fried\nbreakfast 'monsters'. It was closed. Bugger. This was definitely a bad\nomen. We were forced to slum it and cook our own breakfast (which,\nincidentally, was really rather nice).\nWe drove up to Stannage Edge, and considered the state of the\nrock. It was certainly damp, and the low cloud suggested that it wasn't going to get any drier, but it was just about climb able. The cold wind\nfailed to deter one of our number from attempting to look like a proper\nclimber by stripping down to shorts and a vest (Fellwanderers brave?\nYeah, right) and soloing up a descent route. A couple of people started\nto lead some easy routes, without a great deal of enthusiasm, but when\nit started to rain we decided to give up and go back.\nSince most of the afternoon was available to us, we went shopping\nfor gear (the aforementioned fashion freak spent \u00a350 on a pair of\ntrousers), debated the possibilities of finding a dry crag (slim) and decided to go to a wall in Sheffield. The Foundry turned out to be a great\nplace, and at \u00a32 to boulder it made the London walls look decidedly\npricey. Three hours later, pumped, we retired to our hall for a bite to eat\nbefore sampling the wares at the local hostelry. Then came back to the\nhut and started drinking seriously. Some fool discovered the wide range\nof costumes stored in the Hall, and our glorious leader was wearing a dress within minutes (once he'd figured out how to get it on). We have\nphotos, Simon: do you want your mum to see them? On the vague idea\nthat it might be nice tomorrow and we would want to get up early and\nclimb, we crashed out at around three.\nSunday seemed even less promising than Saturday had. We drove tj the world-renowned Grindleford Cafe (that's pronounced \"caff\", with o ul the acute accent, which is for ponce y southerners) for a big, gre as) breakfast. It had just about stopped raining by the time we reached\nFroggat, our crag of choice for the day. Although the classic slabs look el decidedly wet and unpleasant (which ruled them out, since decent fr icj tion is the only thing between you and Sheffield casualty on these,\nroutes), there were a couple of dry routes to lead and top-rope. We managed to get a reasonable amount done in the end: couple of nice leads\neasy soloing and bouldering, and top roping for our less experienced!\nmembers. Not an ideal day, but better than sitting in London in the rain.\nWant to get involved in the frightening but fun world of extreme\nrock? Contact simon.coul son@ ic.ac.uk\n\"Ropes?

    "content": "v frequency The man himself - The Judge\nCapital's Clubbing at it's finest\nThe Gallery, Friday night @ Turnmills\nThe Gallery - Friday night theme\nat Turnmills. Famous galleries\nusually hold several masterpieces.\nIn a clubbing world, The Gallery at\nTurnmills held three; Judge Jules,\nTimo Maas and a memorable atmosphere. Described by experienced c lubbers as the best night\nout in London, true fans of hard-house^and trance would surely\nhave to agree. Situated in the heart of the Clerkenwell area near\nFarringdon Tube Station, Turnmills\nis the home of euphoric music in\nLondon.\n\u00b0n arrival at 11:30pm I laughed at\n'ne ridiculously immense queues,\nmainly due to the very fair \u00a3 1 0\nentry. Avoid disappointment and\n'eave the union bar early. Most' m Portantly, The beefy bouncers\nhave their heads where the sun\ndoesn't shine, so hassling them\nabout the queue is not recommended. The wait is worthwhile,\nso be patient. Once inside get your bearings. The main room\nhosts the big DJs, but a back\nroom playing funky house and a cafe can help you momentarily\nchill out.\nThe night was to be special. Rarely\ndo you see the likes of Timo Maas,\nfollowed swiftly on the decks by\nJudge Jules. Regularly mentioned\nby the Judge on his radio show,\nthe Gallery offers weekly a list full\nof DJs who play there because\nthey want to, knowing the crowd\nwill respond to their sets,\nAs I stood in the middle of the\ntightly packed floor dazed by the\nlaser lights and surrounded by\nsweaty, eccentric, screaming trance lovers, I soon realised that\nthe Gallery does hold the key to\n'ultimate clubbing'.\nWith its fluorescent and luminous\ninterior, abstract wall projections\nand elaborate ceiling decorations,\nTurnmills is definitely for those\nwho appreciate quality. Don't expect a floor packed with gorgeous people though. No, there\nare not to many of us students\npacking the dance floor. Instead\nprepare yourself for a mainly male\nand 20-something crowd, dripping\nwith sweat and rattling with pills.\nDrinks are expensive, but don't let\ndehydration strike. Pace yourself\nthroughout the10:30 pm to\n7:30am session, a vodka and red\nbull will set you back a steep \u00a37.50, while a bottle of Coke is a cool \u00a32.50. Also dress to impress,\nalthough the hardcore Judge fans\ndid manage to contradict this\nhouse rule, being dressed like airport traffic police.\nAs an added extra we ended the\nnight by beating the crowds to the\nDJ booth where we managed to\ngain access, and meet two nice\ngeezers called Jules and Timo.\nNot bad for a night out in one of\nLondon's finest galleries.\nDarren Bailey\nMarble Valley\nSunset Sprinkler\n(Pork Recordings)\nMarble Valley were formed in\n1997 by Steve West, the drummer\nfrom Pavement, and this, their\nsecond album, is a quirky mix of\npercussion and synthesis er driven\ntracks that, despite sounding strange at first, grow on you very\nquickly. Most of the songs are\ngood, some are bad and several\nare just weird but all of them are\nunique. If you are looking for a substitute for this year's rather\nbland offerings, or if you are just a pavement fan you will probably\nenjoy this original, if slightly strange, offering. Sunset Sprinkler\nis released on 4th December.\nThe Action Time\nVersus The World\n(Southern)\nKenickie are dead, long live The\nAction Time. One band, 3 girls\nand 3 boys. One aim, to pervert\nmodern music by steam rolling\nhead first as a punk rock jug ger naut. As subtle as a brick, their\nwhirlwind harmonies leave you\ndazed and confused as they rush\nthrough a full album in less than\n30 minutes.\nTo The Action Time, talking the\ngame and looking right is as\nmuch as the sound. Thick eye lin er, immaculately coiffured black\nhair and Sex Pistol cockiness, it\nall adds to their swagger. A band\naiming high, pushing hard with\neverything they have. Don't expect them to stick around, but\nthe fast thrills are fun while they\nlast.\nc \u2022 \u2022 Felix \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Frequency\n\n"

    "content": "BOAT CLUB HIT THE WAVES Imperial College researchers announced work on Friday 1st which it is hoped may improve the abilities of rowers and reduce the\nlikelihood of them sustaining an injury.\nResearchers from the Biodynamics group studied elite members of the Boat Club using an\nMRI scanner at St Mary's, which allows subjects to carry out tasks normally within it.

The train that sped us from the airport into the city centre was clean, deadly\nsilent and amazingly quick. Efficiency however comes at a price and it was immediately\nevident that Hong Kong was going to be a challenging city to see on a budget.\nJet lagged we stumbled out of our hotel\nroom in the early evening onto Nathan road\nto find the streets jr m still awash with shoppers.

After\narriving at 9:00am, there followed a quick meeting aboard\none of the two Sigma 33s, called Zennor V and Scorcher,\nwhich would be our boats for the duration..

We divided into two groups of six and proceeded to dan our\nwaterproofs. Each skipper then explained the safety risks\nand c per a tic n of the bewildering array of ropes and cleats to\nthe uninitiated and we cast off.

We used a mixture of sail and motor to reach\nFareham and after some anxious moments with high-tension\nelectricity cables, it was lunch tii re. We r roo red and ate an\nthe beats. Gourmet sandwiches (!) , a ccc rr pani ed by fine\nwine (I) were readily consumed. Then, with a slight break in\nthe weather after lunch, we cast off and hoisted the prc ver trial mainsail. Coasting along at a speed of seven knots, the\nwind in cur faces and the sun at cur backs, it was easy to\nunderstand why we had all left our cosy beds at 6am that\nit D ming! We returned to the rr arina, moored the boats and,\nafter having to undo it all again to go in search of diesel we\ncleaned up and returned to the m urL bus.

    "content": "stage Eye Contact Riverside Studios, Hammersmith\n4 - Play ICSM Drama Society\nE ye Contact had already attracted a wave of tabloid\npublicity - here was a chance to\ncatch model, cover girl and\n(allegedly) near illiterate Big Breakfast presenter Kelly Brook in\na new play dealing with the phenomenon of table dancing clubs.\nThe production is a look into the\n\"sexual dynamics\" of this world -and, to its credit, certainly manages\nto stay a comfortable notch above\nlate-night Channel 5 material.\nKelly Brook plays Anya, a brassy\ntable dancer in \" Fantasy International\", a London table-dancing club that is struggling to\npull in the punters. Meanwhile, Hugo (Keir Charles) is a he don is tic, high-flying City banker who is\nbesotted with Anya, and is besotted to the extent that he repeatedly tries to move their relationship to the world outside the club\n- Anya however is having none of\nit and the play is an exploration of\nthe flirtatious interplay between\nthe two - will she concede, or will\nHugo have to be satisfied with a dance to end his evening?\nNow all of this has great potential\nto be supremely boring, but the narrative is punctuated with several\nsub-plots which add to the psychological tension. Subplots include\nthe dealings of the depraved and\nfrustrated club owner, and also\nHugo's colleague, the stiff family\nman Philip, who also becomes involved with the club.\nContrasting with the three strong\nmain characters (Hugo, Anya and\nPhilip), some of the lesser characters are somewhat wooden and\nare let down badly by the script\nwhich at times throws up clich e after clich e. Kelly Brook shows\nshe can actually act and is the real\nstar of the play, while Keir Charles\nputs in a good performance, slightly marred by occasional overacting but still making his character likeable in its pathos. Terence\nBooth is also fabulous as the conservative and staid City gent.\nThere is some nudity (all four of\nthe girls have a brief turn at the\npole, with Kelly Brook at the cli-max), but it is brief and certainly\nnot tacky or gratuitous. Then\nagain, this isn't exactly intellectual\nfodder, remaining a glamour show\nat heart. So go see. (But is it art?\nArts Ed).\nSunil\nThe Knowledge:\nFrom the mouths of (fresher s) come the wisdom of kings.\nThe format is simple; the new blood\nto the drama society performs a series of short plays or extracts,\nstaged annually in Gladys.\nThere is no central theme; the\nplays are chosen entirely at the\ndiscretion of individual directors,\nmaking for a suitably diverse evening. The audience sat around\ncandle-lit tables, drinking wine and\neating nibbles, and the atmosphere\nwas relaxed and friendly.\nThe first play, an excerpt from\nMichael Frayn's Copenhagen,\nexplored the wartime relationship of\nHeisenberg and Bohr, two physicists\nfrom opposing sides, discussing the\npossibilities of an atomic bomb... this\ncomplex piece with its mixed mess ages was strongly acted, and\nserved as a stimulating introduction\nto the evening.\nCrazy.For You was not a Gershwin\nmusical, but an excellent concept\nplay, in the form of a series of psychiatrist and patient consultations.\nThe twist here is that the patient\ncomes to realise that she is in a play - under the lights, with people\nwatching, and aware of the true\npassage of time... Audio representing the doctor's thoughts, and lighting were used to great effect to\nadd to the ingenious work performed here.\nMother Figure by Alan Ayckbourne\nwas the third play.

(Not the impression I got, but thanks for clearing it up -Ed) If you would like an official\nGuilds statement (or simply want a list of all the inaccuracies in your last\narticle) please get in touch with the\nVice-President, Sarah Bluhme, who\nis responsible for all mascot rya ff i ars.\n(2) You did not print my letter about\nour DPF&S.I am assuming that this\nis because you did not want to print\ntwo letters from the same person\n(what would you do if both myself\nand the other Mustafa Arif were to\nwrite in at the same time?) and not\nbecause you only like printing nasty\nstuff about Etienne. So, to spare you\nfrom having to choose between let-ter s,I 've tagged it on to the end of\nthis one:\nFollowing a state of letters from various people publicly expressing their\ngrievances with our Deputy President (Finance & Services), I thought I'd write in to say that I think\nhe's doing a sterling job. From my\nown experiences so far he seems to\nbe competent and con sci en to us.I have also found him to be courteous\nat all times (although he is known to\nhave a short temper).\nThey way I see it. Any DP(F&S) is\nbound to upset a few people. That is\nthe nature of the job. He can't just\nlet everyone spend whatever they\nwant, or he wouldn't be doing a decent job as a treasurer. Keep up\nthe good work Etienne.\nMustafa Arif\nNo, I don't mind printing good stuff\nabout Etienne. 2 letters in a week is\na little greedy though, so I was\ngoing to print it this week, along\nwith all the other letters I didn't have\nroom for last week. Some people\nhave no patience... Can both\nMustafas please state their departments though, otherwise I'm bound\nto get confused and I don't want\nthat. Secondly, lets not talk about\ninaccuracies, shall we? Especially\nnot when it comes to docking\nEditor's salaries -Ed\nA QUESTION OF NO FAITH\nDear Editor,\nAs the acting president of the\nSecular Society and the author of\nthe the Societies posters I feel\nmoved to reply to Mr Yorke-Smith's letter in your last issue (1190, 27th December). I feel that I can clarify\nsome points of Secular belief to Mr\nYorke-Smith, and answer some of\nhis questions, something I could not\ndo for the author of the previous letter (Wes), whose crit is is m took the\nform of a rant rather than that of a rational argument.\nIn his letter Mr Yorke-Smith asks\nwhether I am promoting sci ent is m rather than science. The Secular\nSociety does indeed believe that the\nScientific method, that of rational\ninquiry, is the only philosophically\ndefensible method of finding out\nfacts about the Universe. Now two\nquestions will spring to the mind of\nthe religious reader. The first would\nprobably be : Is this a masked a priori rejection of religion and the idea\nof a God ?\nThe answer is no, the Secular Society offers no objections a priori\nagainst the possibility of a deity.\nHowever we maintain that should a deity exist the only way of objectively verifying its existence would be\nthrough rational inquiry, be it scientific or philosophical. What we maintain is that there is no rational evidence for a God, and therefore no\nreason to believe in one. What we\ncategorically are not saying is that\nscience and rationality somehow\npreclude the possibility of a deity.\nTherefore we do indeed think clearly\nabout the evidence of a Palestinian\nteacher 2000 years ago. We analyse\nall evidence in a rational way and\ncome to conclusions. It is simply a matter of fact that we come to the\natheist conclusion, rather than a scientific conspiracy against religious\nevidences. In conclusion, this 'atheist\na priori dismissal' meme finds safety\nin popularity, rather than in sub-stance.\nThe second query that might come\nto mind would be : Does this mean\nthat the only thing that matters is\nscience, and that science can\nanswer everything ? Clearly once\nagain the Secular answer is a resounding no. It would be impossible for even a hardened Scientist to\nderive any defensible moral system\nby science alone I Of course emotions matter I Where would any of\nus be without love, guilt, anger, hap-pines s...? Indeed it is obvious to\ntheists and atheists alike that science isn't all that matters. And as a matter of fact there are questions\nthat science (at this moment) cannot\nanswer, the big 'why' questions that\nMr Yorke-Smith was alluding to.\nHowever this does not mean that\nthere must be something else that\ncan answer them. Nor that these\nquestions even have a satisfactory\nanswer I The question 'why are we here ?' in\nmy opinion is a bit of a null question\nin the ab sense of a creator God. If in\nfact there is no God, then the question has no emotionally satisfying\nanswer. We can scientifically find\nout about evolution, and the origin of\nspecies, and the regress of the uni-verse, but in the absence of forethought there is no real why . We just are, its as simple as that. The\nfact that this is not as emotionally\nsatisfying an answer as is given in\nGenesis is by the by. However it\ndoes not lead to the conclusion that\nlife or the universe is in her ant ly worthless because it lacks purpose.\nIn fact, the Secular Society values\nlife as much as any other, and wishes only to improve its condition on\nplanet earth.\nI would like to thank Mr Yorke-Smith\nfor his letter, since it has allowed me\nto clarify exactly the position of the\nSecular Society on some very irn por, tant matters that are often misun.derstood and misrepresented\nwould also like to invite him, al on q with anyone else who would like to\nask us questions, to our first meet,\ning which will be held from 4-6\u00bb\ndBs on Wednesday6 th0: December. And finally dear Editor\nthankyou very much for your time\nand column space,\nYours Sincerely,\nNikolai Segura\nDear Felix,\nIt has come to my attention\nthat certain people at Imperial\nCollage are slightly lacking ina\nsense of humour. While I definitely\ndon't want to be drawn into a Science vs. Religion argument (\nmy own life experiences having giver\nme an incredibly polarised view ol the whole debate), I do think that\nthere is a bit too much sensitivity\nregarding Mr Secura's posters.\nI personally feel that the secular\nsocieties posters are light-hearted\nMy belief, Wes, is that the \"Born OK the first time\" was a reference to the'\nChristian philosophy that one has tc\nbe \"born again\" within the faith to be \"saved\" - a little play on words, that's all.\nWhen any group (i.e. not necessarily\nreligious) protests so loudly about\nsomething which is still only someone else's opinion, it tends to gi*\nthe impression that they are worried\nthat the masses won't choose their\nown group if this individual says sud1 and such. Which would indicate that\nthey are worried that their own\nwords aren't as persuasive or strong\nin foundation. Please note I am not saying this is necessarily the easel\nbut that it is the impression that\ncomes across. A bit like when someone says \"ooo hh, what did you t \u00abc get up to last night!\", and you 9eI[ really defensive and angry be ca us6, you know they're right.\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 no011 drop into the office or email fe!ix@jc.ac.uk. Letters may be edited f \u00b0f length but not grammar or spelling.\nLetters \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

    "content": "Football - game on\nFirst Bus a Point for the First s IC 1 - 1 LSE It was a gigantic day. A day when wars are\nwon and lost, life cannot compare to days like\nthese. Everyone knew what they had to do. IC\nfirsts needed some BUS A points. The team rose\nto the challenge. When the ref decided that the\ngame was for nonce s only, by giving free kicks for thinking of touching your marker, IC battled\nfor the game. The first half was slack, but a couple of extra gears were found in the second half.\nPsycho got his first goal for 3 years - a penalty\nvery nearly saved by the keeper. JP made akwa lit y debut, but couldn't stop the penalty that\nthey had. Eniola was superb playing on the right,\nAli G got booked as did James. We all then had\na few social ales to celebrate the first BUS A point.\nBrunei 3 - 1 IC I This was a game we expected to lose. Not\nthe first line that you would expect in a match\nreport? No! But after last times' 9 - 0 defeat, we\nneeded to show some strength. We had to prove\nourselves to BUS A. Unfortunately we conceded a goal early on\nbut we showed no signs of weakness. Coming\nback strong, Eniola, Comfort and Tony were\nsuperb and soon after a cross from Alan found\nGeorge and he scored his first goal for IC. HE\nWENT MENTAL, that's how much it means. IC\nwere superb for the rest of the half and Alan\ncame close on a free kick.\nThe second half proved eventful. They\nscored two goals, somehow, but an ambulance\n90t stuck in the mud and Joule's contact lens\n9ot semi-lost. Amidst it all, Oily made a comeback on the right wing and we had about three\ngoal mouth scrambles. Comfort put the ball in\n'he back of the net but it was deemed offside.\nUnfortunately, the score remained at 3 - 1\nand it was not our day. But bearing in mind that\nth ey rely on Vauxhall Conference players to\nboost their side- we did okay.\nThirds light the blue touch Paper\nl Sf: IV 1 . 2 IC III\nOn a day when most matches were called\noff, the thirds braved the elements and the public transport system to reach the blasted wastes\nof Berrylands and claim the three points we\ndeserved.\nMore used to the semi-marsh that is\nHarlington, the bowling green surface that LSE play on came as a bit of a shock, but a shock we\nused to our advantage. Early doors, we were\nstroking the ball around the park with panache\nand fluidity. The LSE defense was overweight\nand apparently unskilled and so the pace of Phil\nup front and James down the right wing had\nthem in all sorts of trouble. As an attacking force\nthe economists weren't much to write home\nabout, whatever made it past Paul and sturdy\nnew guy Ian in midfield was not trouble at all for\nour defense.\nThey had barely ventured into our half when\nthe first goal came, lain hit the ball long down\nthe left for Phil to chase. One sprint and a minor\nscuffle later and Phil was on his own on the edge\nof the box and he generously decided to s gu are the ball to an unmarked lain who side footed it in\nfor his first goal for IC. It was an open goal but\nit's a start...\nYou may have thought that going behind\nwould have kick started our opposition, but no,\nthey were as lethargic as ever. Phil hit the bar as\nPesh began to get into the game going down the\nleft and was on hand to finish off a controversial\nmove for our second goal. James unleashed Phil\ndown the left again but this time he was cynically hacked down by the now desperate, wide-boy\ndefense. Incredibly the ref waved play on but\nthis was to advantage as\nJames squared the loose\nball which Pesh turned in at\nfull stretch.\nWith the ref clearly on\ntheir side, LSE galvanized\ntheir shower of a team and\nat least we were given some\nworthy opposition. Before\nthe break there were\nchances at either end but no\nmore goals.\nHenry, \"Dad\" Eyers and\nAlex came on for Pesh,\nJames and lain and the second half started as the first had. Mike and John,\nwith little defensive duties to do, went on some\nblinding runs up the wing while Henry showed us\nsome more of his cheeky play. It looked like curtains for LSE but the ref came to their aid. In a rare attack the ball was crossed into our area\nand the referee blew up for a penalty for no\napparent reason. Dhruve had obstructed a player he explained, this was news to Dhurve and\nanyway, obstruction is usually an indirect free-kick! Their striker, to be fair took it well, but we\ndidn't and the referee's life may have been in\ndanger.\nThis inspired LSE and they looked dangerous for the first time in the match but our\ndefense did its job well and they were shut out.\nAt the death, \"Dad\" Eyers was put through one-on-one with the keeper and got hacked to the\nground from behind for his trouble. No surprises\n- the ref waved play on but sooner or later he\nhad to blow the final whistle and hand us the vic-tory.\n!

He has managed, in an election more fraught and tightly contested than\ne ven your average student union sabbatical\nelection, being elected by 52 to 51 votes to the\npresidency of the' Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals', the lobbying and\nsupport organisation for UK universities. The\nCVCP (sort of the College equivalent to the\nfv|US, except they're affiliated and we're not) is\nplanning to turn itself from a genteel commit-tee, as it was founded at the turn of the cent u ry, into a more forceful lobbying organisation.\nSo how does this affect us? There shouldn't be\na great problem for us in higher education\ninstitutions improving their lobbying force with\ngovernment - I have previously commented on\nthe dire lack of government funding and this is\nsomething students and university admins t rations appear to agree on. There are some people who would like co-operation between stu-dent, administrative, staff and institutional representative organisations, on matters of common concern to them. This is something I have\nbeen advocating to the Aldwych Group( the\nstudent unions of the top 19 research institutions that make up the Russell Group), and is\nan approach we will have taken to our ViceChancellor equivalents last week in an\nAldwych-Russell meeting.\nWe hope to set up meetings throughout the\nyear, and to find common ground for joint government lobbying. This isn't as silly or unreal is by Hamish Common\nPresident, Imperial College Union\ntic as it may sound - there is a serious possibility of a general election before the end of this\nacademic year, and previous joint stances have\nhad an effect on government policy and party\nmanifestoes.\nI don't know what the chances are of this plan\nworking in practise. I have noticed that the\nattitudes of student leaders and institutional\nheads vary widely on policy and co-operation,\nand if student politics is anything to go by,\noccasions where they agree around a common\ntheme are few and far between. Naturally, we\nwish to push for commitments not to increase\ntuition fees and to ensure that the sort of students that attend Imperial are not disadvantaged by the Government's plan to increase\nstudent numbers in the way it plans.\nThe CVC P themselves are producing a report\non higher education funding - presently in its\nprovisional stages - which will form the basis of\ntheir submission to government, just as all the\nparties form their manifestoes for the election.\nWe are hoping to influence this in favour of\nstudents - the NUS will undoubtedly be pushing an agenda as well: though there is more\nhope that this year they may care as their\nPresident wasn'ta Labour appointee and does-n't appear to be seeking a parliamentary seat\nin the next by-election. The political parties\nmay be more impressed by the varying representative organs at ions in higher education\npulling together to press student-friendly policy out of government, rather than let them\nwatch a spectacle of infighting that ensures we\nget pushed to the bottom of the pile.\nMuch of this depends on the leading characters among the CVC P and Russell Group. The\nnew CVC P President, Roderick Floud in a recent article in the Guardian Education as\npart of his bid for the presidency, talked of the\nstudent body in ten years' time. His comments\nare mixed blessings for students. He recognises that if we want to expand education, much\nmore money has to be spent on access, but\ndoesn't say where it's coming from. The thing\nthat is particularly annoying about differential\nfees (increased fees at higly-ranked institutions such as IC) is that it's us that has to pay\nthem in order to fund a completely different\nset of people to study at un vier s it y. Professor\nFloud's other ideas of obsolescent terms and\ntimetables and no-one going to lectures and all\nlearning over the net may be far fetched, though he is also one of an increasing number\nof people who advocate students living at\nhome and commuting to university.\nThe national press are interested in an\nAldwych-Russell meeting, so this is a chance\nto get our views across to wider population. If\nyou have any views or any particular example\nabout where student life may, or ought to be\ngoing in the next few years then tell me. There\nis a better opportunity this year than for a long\ntime, so use it.\nFirstly an update on what Rag has been doing since the last column; An\nopen meeting saw us roughly map out Rag week, giving ourselves plenty\nof hard work to do. Details cannot be revealed here but you will all find out\nsoon enough. Suffice to say that we hope to give you a packed week of\nevents which aim to include as many members of the college as possible,\nwhilst raising lots of money for two very deserving charities.\nWe also held a gathering to present the cheques from last years Rag.\nCheques were given to representatives of Alone in\nLondon and the Dyslexia Institute. The event gave\nus all an opportunity to reflect on the past year,\nand look forward to the rest of this years efforts.\nLooking back over all that has been achieved gave us all an idea of the work\ninvolved, and the work we still have to do to achieve our target of raising\n'30,000 for charity this year. So a big well done to Martin, Farhad and all\ninvolved last year for a fantastic year.\nFriday November 17th saw the annual BBC Children in Need appeal.\nWhilst this was not something we were involved with, Emma Watson from\n'he Ch\nem is try department coordinated some serious fundraising which\nsee a cheque for over ?1100 being sent to the appeal.\nshould\nAnd here are a few words about our other nominated charity, Great\nOrmond St.\nIl' s Britain's biggest specialist hospital for children and is dedicated to\ntreating and caring for youngsters with the most unusual, complex and rare\nconditions.\nEvery year over 100,000 children from across the country, and sometimes\noverseas, come here for treatment. Specialist doctors from Great Ormond\nStreet also go to local hospitals where they offer expert advice on a wide\nrange of children's medical problems - from heart disease to asthma. Over\n100 different clinics are now run regularly across the country - and the number is growing. Great Ormond Street Hospital is world renowned for its pioneering work. Alongside the hospital's doctors and nurses are over 200 scientists at the Institute of Child Health, the hospital's research partner. They\nare investigating the causes of and finding cures for a i JUl.i wide range of children's illnesses. The Hospital's motto\n\"V* is 'The Child First and Always' - and it's designed\nespecially with children in mind. For more info visit\ntheir website at www.gosh.org\nFor details of forthcoming Rag events, reviews, a new competition and\nnews of our raffle, plus Pete's highly entertaining editorial, visit the Rag website at www.icu-rag.org.uk\nComing up this term, we have carol singing at Euston and Liverpool St\nStation for Alone in London, our big raffle, a few cloakrooms and more.\nWith the end of term fast approaching it is time to look back on how far we\ntarget. Friends have been made and we have a working committee who I am\nconfident in saying will ensure that we more than meet our target. However,\nthere is still room for new ideas, help and volunteers, so if you are interested\nin joining us then email us at rag@ic.ac.uk\nFinally a big thank you to everyone who has helped us get this far.\nEnough of my ramblings, have a good week\nVick\n9 \u2022 Felix \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022\n\n"

    "content": "screen Urban Legends: Final Cut Black and White Director: John Ottman\nStarring: Jennifer Morrison,\nMatthew Davis and Eva Mendes\nT he sequel to the year before\nlast's story about a campus-based serial killer is (somewhat\nun surprisingly) another story about a campus-based serial killer.\nThis time the campus is Alpine University, the elitist film school. It\nis the end of term and senior year\nstudents are rushing to finish their\nthesis films before they graduate.\nCompetition for the best film is\nmade even tougher by the prestigious Hitchcock award; a prize\nwhich not only gives the recipient\na large sum of money, but also the\nchance to make films in\nHollywood. A opportunity that film\nstudents would literally kill for.\nThis actually adds quite a nice\ntwist- a sort of 'is it part of the\nfl lr\" or part of the film in the film' -which distinguishes it from the\nfir st 'Urban Legend'.\nn fact the whole story is quite\nSe Parate from the first. The only\ncharacter to cross over is Reese\n( L \u00b0 r etta Devine), the Campus security guard, a little bit tougher\nut still the same; and the rumour\nof an Urban Legend killer at 'some\nUniversity up the coast'. This rumour inspires our heroine, Amy\n(Jennifer Morrison), to make her\nthesis film a psychological thriller\nabout a serial killer who kills his\nvictims in the style of urban leg-ends. Most of the urban legends\nhave quite a long run up to them -you know something is going to\nhappen but you're not quite sure\nwhat. This means that half the fun\nof the film is trying to guess which\nurban legend is about to happen.\nIn many ways this film is similar to\nall others of its genre. The main\ncharacter is a girl with 'issues' in\nher past. She works out long\nbefore anyone else that everyone\nis being murdered and that all the\nmurders are related to her. Of course, no one believes her. There\nis some dubious male interest\nTrevor (Matthew Davies) that you\nare not quite sure if she should\ntrust and despite the fact that she\nknows someone is trying to kill her\nshe runs towards the sound of\nscreaming, on her own, completely\nunarmed, in the dark. But lets face\nit, if you like teen thriller slasher s then this will be right up your alley\n(preferably a deserted one with\nminimal lighting and a masked\nserial killer hiding in the shadows).\n(In cinemas now). Katherine\nDirector: James Toback\nStarring: Brooke Shields, Robert\nDowney Jr. and Ben Stiller\nAt first thought, Black and\nWhite seems like a terrible\nIdea for a movie. A picture star-ring, amongst others, Claudia Schiffer, NBA star Allan Houston,\nselected members of the Wu-Tang\nclan, and Mike Tyson all in a movie\nabout Black and White cultures\ncolliding in modern day New York.\nThe movie is a mess - there seems\nto be very little structure to it at\nall. There is a weak central plot\nconcerning a corrupt cop (Stiller)\nwho bribes a basketball star to\nthrow a game with unexpectedly\ntragic consequences. There does-n't appear to have been any script\nfor this movie - it bounces from\nscene to scene without any obvious direction, and most of it is\nclearly hugely improvised. There is\na woman making a documentary\n(Shields) about white teens hanging out in the ghetto pretending to\nbe \" niggaz\". Her husband's( Downey Jnr.) homosexuality seems to be obvious to everyone\nexcept her . There's a black gang\nwho just seem to spend their entire time shagging up in a penthouse apartment belonging to a rap group (members of the Wu Tang clan).\nWhat stops this from being a total\ndisaster is the cast - unusual, cer-tain ly, but some fine perform anc es. Ben Stiller and Joe Pantoliano\nturn in some good work, and\nDowney Jnr. is very amusing. What is more surprising is that the\nsupporting cast isn't too bad -Schiffer and Houston won't be\nwinning any Oscars, but their presence doesn't kill the movie like\nother celebrity performances could\nhave done (i.e. Cindy Crawford, Aaliyah etc). And Tyson is just\nhimself. The Idea of anyone asking\nTyson for advice on conflict resolution is funny enough, but the scene\nwhere Downey Jnr. comes on to\nhim is hilarious.\nBlack and White is an acquired\ntaste; It's interesting if nothing\nelse. If you can swallow a movie\nthat's less than the sum of it's collective parts you may find it a stimulating hour and forty minutes. If\nyou're looking for some story in\nthere to stimulate the grey matter,\nyou'll be disappointed.\n(Black and White is in cinemas\nnow).\nTom\nScreen \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

You\nsee, they lack attitude, a beautiful\nfront person and most of all they just\naren't plain loud enough. What they\ndo have is an abundance of charm,\nsweet acoustic melodies and the\nability to turn hauntingly angst when\nthey please. Take, Mind over Money\nfor example, an example of there\nmini folk Radiohead tendencies. A band to keep an eye on, but probably best listened to on record. Whereas with Doves, their electrifying live show surpasses even the LP, Lost Souls, a sure contender for\nalbum of the year.\nTo cap the Doves best year yet,\nthey sell out the Empire two nights\nrunning, get the pick of the bands\n\"who are mostly likely\" to support\nthem, then turn in a blistering set of\nblood, sweat and guitar majesty.\nSongs like Sea Song and Here it\nComes, are given time and space to\ndevelop and soar. From Badly Drawn Boy's backing band to a Mercury nomination in under two\nyears, the Doves are here to enjoy\nthemselves. Utilising stunning vis u als, ranging from short pre tens cio us films to hy not ic swirls, the band fully\nentrance the audience for the whole-set.

Which after that dour\ninterval, on an otherwise night\nof celebration, brings us to the\nheadliners. Once, a poor man'sO as is, a band that could play\nthe right tunes, but never really\nhit the target. But this year has\nbeen different, the band have\nmatured, grown relaxed and more confident, songs that use\nto drag and die out, now lift and\ndrive. Embrace, really are the\nfull package now, a very British\nrock band. Ignore the fact that\nany half wit can sing better than\nDanny, just feel the atmosphere\nand dig those grooves. They bang out all the hits, we all sing\nalong and it's lovely, no alarms\nand no surprises. With Embrace,\nyou get exactly what it says on\nthe tin, with no pseudo-art toss\nguitar wank. For every Tortoise\nalbum you own, you need Embrace style sing-a long indie\nanthems to balance your life.\nThey play Save Me, Hooligan,\nOne Big Family et al. As Danny\nMacnamara struts and nods, and\ngrows into a prince among front\nmen, everyone helps the band\nraise the roof.

In the biggest( event in College, the this year's show saw over 800\nale, including over 150 participants, take part\n[in the sold-out event. The show included various\ndances, catwalks, comedy sketches, and live\nsinging from both eastern and western cultures.\nSome of the most artistically talented students set\nout to display that Imperial was not just about\nstudying. Including a gracious catwalk and a very\nlively bollywood dance many present described it\nas a thoroughly enjoyable night. However, the\nevent was marred by a number of attacks from\nunknown groups, apparently trying to bring the show into disrepute.\nAccording to organ\njj ers, the philosophy of||: he evening was represented by numerous eastern and western jets, showing, \"a harmonious unity of the ii verse cultures\". However, right from the beginning became apparent that\nminority were[ attempting to use the night\nIs an opportunity for racial\n[and religious demonstrations. After they were distributed on seats in the Great Hall, many of the\nofficial programmes for the event (some two hun-dred) had pamphlets inserted in them without the\norganisers' knowledge. The professionally-printed\npamphlets complained of apparent abuse of non-Hindu's in India. Questioning the Indian govern ment's human rights record, the leaflets accused\nia's \"Nazi Government\" of \"Ethnic cleansing\".\nJatil Damania, Vice President of the Indian Society\ncondemned the protest as a \"cowardly attack\",\nadding that it was \"we do not dispute freedom of\nexpression, but it was completely against the ethos\nof the evening and was inappropriate to the situ a tion.\"\nEven before Thursday night, the society had[ complained that, as with their last three events,\ntheir posters had been interfered with.

Though IC\nsecurity was briefed on the situation, the perpetrators have yet to be found. The cost to the Indian\nsociety (one of the largest socs in IC) is estimated\nto be in excess of a thousand pounds altogether.\nWhat has worried security and the show organisers so deeply is the well organised and mass orchestrated nature of this latest attack. The leaflets were professionally designed and a few hundred sneaked in past Union stewards. Organisers appeared mystified that two hundred\nleaflets had been inserted in the programs, despite\nthe Great Hall having\napparently been left\nattended for\" about five minutes\".\nThe pamphlets referred to two groups\n1 called the\" National Sikh Youth\" and \"Khalsa Human Rights\".\nFelix was unable to contact Khalsa on the\nHB M number provided, but\nwas able to send a fax through asking about the organisation's role at Imperial College, although no\nresponse had been received as Felix went to press.\nThe leaflet also referred to a report called \"India-Torture, Rape & Deaths in Custody\" by Amnesty International, which is not available among the\nmany reports on the Indian Government by the human rights watchdog.\nFortunately organisers collected most of the leaflets as soon as they were discovered, and the\nincident did not substantially overshadow the show, which raised approximately \u00a33000 for chari-ty. The atmosphere at the after show party was\ndescribed as \"electric\" and organisers praised the\n\"enormous\" response to the show.

    "content": "arts Described by Alex James of\nthe band Blur as 'the original Soho nut case,' William\nBlake, poet, printer and author\nof that rousing hymn\nJerusalem, was born just off\nGolden Square in the late\nNovember of 1757. The\nAmerican and French Revolutions were to follow, yet all\nMr Blake managed for the next\n70 years, until his death in\n1827, was to churn out an endless series of insipid pictures\nfrom his print shop in Lambeth.\nBlur and Blake do actually have\nsomething in common. They\nboth attempt to recapture the\nEnglish past; for Blur it is the\ncheeky-c happy Brit style popularised by The Kinks; for Blake\nit was a ye olde Canterbury\nTales pastiche of the\nMediaeval. Mr Blake's bulky\nprinting press, source of all this\npseudo-Mediaeval malarkey,\nsits at the centre of the exhibition like an instrument of torture - and it does a good job\ninflicting boring Blake upon the\nTate punters.\nMuch of the work is religious,\nwith countless, sometimes inter-e sting, even modern (the series\nfor Dante's Inferno) prints but\nmore often degenerating into\nrather ridiculous allegory.\nThe truth is that this exhibition\nwould be better served outside\nthe Tate, in a smaller museum\nin the provinces (how about the\ndusty but spectacular Fitzwilliam in Cambridge?). Since\nmuch of the fine art in the Tate\nhas been shipped to Tate\nModern, Tate Britain is now in\ntransition and sadly bereft of\npurpose. The ex hi bi it ion is\nclearly an attempt to reconfigure the PR image away from\nmodern international art. But\nthe Blake is not good enough\nto do this, and anyway, it all\nsits uncomfortably with the\nCool Britannia of the Turner\nPrize (in the adjacent gallery).\nWith the \u00a332 million revamp of\nTate Britain continuing apace\n(due for completion in 2001),\nwe can only hope Sir Nicholas\nSerota (Director of Tate) wakes\nup to the disastrous Blake misfire currently splattering over\nhis gallery. Tate Britain could\nand should do better.\nWilliam\nThe Knowledge:\nUntil: 11th February 2001\n\u00a35 concession,\nNearest tube: Pimlico\nWebsite:\nhttp://www.tate.org.uk\nTurner - The Great Watercolours Royal Academy of Art\nTo mark the 150th anniversary\nof the death of Turner, the\nR \u00b0y al Academy of Art is holding a commemorative exhibition of his\nWa\nter colour works. There are\n0 vera hundred pieces here from\nMinute sketches to large com mis Sl\n\u00b0ns, chronicling his entire life's Wor\nk. The RA has put particular\neffort into this show, with loans\nfrom both UK and US collections,\na fitting tribute to one of their\nmost illustrious students.\nInitially, the exhibition seems like\nany other, with the first room\nbeing mainly his early sketches.\nHis early work shows a keen\narchitectural awareness, with the\nbuildings being rendered in\nminute detail, a marked contrast\nto the later watercolours and oils.\nIn the second room holds paintings that are definitively Turner.\nAtmospheric, dramatic scenes\nwith turbulent wild skies are\nprevalent, impressions hinted at\nwith only the barest detail. Dark\nhues in some of the more disturbing storm paintings contrast\nstrongly with the calm serenity of\nthe dawn and dusk scenes. All\nthese paintings have an added\nlevel of subtlety, with the watercolour washes sometimes betray\nthe care and attention that have\nbeen lavished on each piece.\nThe series entitled Picturesque\nViews in England and Wales is\nconsidered to be some of the finest\nBritish landscapes ever made, and\nsome of the larger compositions\nare very impressive - these contrast with some pieces that would-n't look out of place on a chocolate\nbox. I'm sure distinguished art critics will be crying out after reading\nthis, but I don't know much about\nart, and I know what I like.\nThere are some striking larger\npieces in the third room (is the\nstrongest of the three), accompanied by some verse written by the\nartist himself. The exhibition in\ngeneral is a good view of Turner's watercolour work, but I find it difficult to recommend, because of\nthe scandalous five-pound entry\nfee for students, and because\nTurner's more familiar work is far\nbetter represented for free in the\nTate Britain.\nTom\nThe Knowledge:\nUntil: 18th February 2001\n\u00a35 students, \u00a37 adults\nNearest tube: Green Park or\nPicadilly Circus\nWebsite:\nhttp://wv,w. royal academy. org.uk\n\u2022Felix \u2022 4th December 2000 \u2022 Arts\n\n"

    "content": "NE'& Hro KNOW Bloody Sunday: Day of reckoning M ARIAM GH ORB ANNE J AD Today, the inquiry into the deaths\nDf 13 Catholics during a paratroops operation in Londonderry's Bogside District on January30||72, will re-open.\nThe announcement of a fresh tri-Ijinal was made by Tony Blair in\nJanuary 1998. Oral evidence was\nl/ en at Londonderry's Guildhall in\nMarch of this year. Lord Saville of\nMewdigate is chairing the inquiry,\n(Kith costs running to \u00a313m so far.\nAlthough the original tribunal of\n1972 led by Lord\nChief Justice Lord Mdgery found the Army to be innocent of any wrongdoing, the families\nof the victims disagreed. Their persistent campaigning to get justice\nfor their relatives has caused the\nPrime minister to set up this new\npublic inquiry. It will re-examine the\nevidence, which could prove that the\ncivilian victims were unarmed at the\ntime of the shootings.\nAt approximately 2 . 3 0 pm on\nSunday January 30 1972, the march\nof civilian rights demonstrators left\nBishofields. It is estimated that the\n*ge crowd comprised of between\n!0,000 and 20,000 people, certainly\n'he biggest gathering ever held in\nLondonderry. The event was trou-ble-free until the protestors reached\nlr|\ne first army barricade on William\nb tree t an hour later, barring their\n^trance into the Guildhall and Waterloo Place. It was at this point\n, hat the noting started, where it is\nalle9e d, that men of the2 nd battalion were stoned for 10 min-u tes. CS gas and a water cannon\nwere used to disperse the crowd,\n^eat James Street and Sackville\n^tr\neet, where two other army harri-es Were erected, also saw mass\n\"o|en ce, with soldiers firing rubber\ne ts as well as releasing huge\n3 rn \u00b0unt s of gas into the crowd.\n^ Kevin McCorry, the civil rights\norganiser, informed the crowd that a meeting was starting at Free Derry\nCorner, where Miss Devlin, Mr Cooper and Lord Brockway would\nbe giving speeches. This occurred at\n4.15pm, ten minutes after a single\nshot was fired in William Street.\nFour or five armoured vehicles descended on William Street in an\nattempt to break up the crowd.\nThousands fled as paratroopers\nemerged from their vehicles. Some\ntried to make arrests; others ran\ntowards street corners. These 21\nff Unleashing a furious army snipers\nbarrage of bullets JJ opened fire unleashing a furious barrage of bullets onto the streets of\nBogside. In Fahen Street, one man\nwas even seen holding up a white\nhanker chief but this did not deter\nthe soldiers from directing shots at\nhim. Sounds of machine guns,\nthought to be the work of the IRA,\npunctuated the continuous hard\nbanging of the self-loading rifle\n(SLRs), attributed to the British. In\nfive separate locations around\nBogside thirty people were killed or\ninjured, predominantly young men\nbut including a woman knocked\ndown by a speeding Army vehicle.\nLawyers for the fourteen victims\nhave accumulated 60,000 pages of\nevidence to date. Mystery still surrounds the rifles which Lord Saville\nasked the Ministry of Defence for,\nback in 1998. He had requested al!\nthe SLR s used by the paratrooper\nso that they could be subject to rigorous forensic examination. This\ncould reveal whether adapted rifles\nordered by Major General Robert\nFord were used on Bloody Sunday.\nMajor General Robert Ford was\nthen in charge of the running of the\nArmy in Northern Ireland. Saville\nhas recently declassified a secret\nmemo from Ford to Lieutenant\nGeneral Harry Tuzo, his Superior in\nUlster. He calls the rioters 'Derry\nYoung Hooligans (DYH)' and continues that traditional crowd control\nmethods such as CS gas and rubber\nbullets were not proving effective in\ndealing with them. Stormont and\nWestminster were keen for the\nArmy to restore peace in the\nprovince, particularly in the catholic\nareas. More relevant to the inquiry\nis the statement Ford made at the\nend of the memo, only three weeks\nprior to the fateful riots of Bloody\nSunday. \"The minimum force necessary to achieve a restoration of law\nand order is to shoot selected ringleaders among the DYH after clear\nwarnings have been given.\" He pro-claimed.\nThe self-loading rifles in question\nwere the main infantry weapons\ndeployed by the British Army in the\n1970s. However they were phased\nout steadily until they were eventually replaced by the SA80 in 1986.\nOf the 20 rifles produced in the\nWi d ger y inquiry, 14 have been\ndestroyed as well as 10 sold to private companies. Although the\ninquiry was told the 5 rifles left\n7.62mm round in the SLRs. Notably\nthough, one of those killed, 17 year\nold Kevin McElhimey, had an entry\nwound which measured only 3mm. The pathologists' findings could be\nat fault or the bullet may have been\nfired from a different type of rifle\naltogether, possibly a0.22 in (which\nthe S A80 fires) . Size of the entry\nwound alone does not give the\nwhole picture as the same bullet can\nproduce various dimensions according to whether the it was a ricochet,\nthe type of body tissue infiltrated\nand the path it follows in the air. It\nseems with just three rifles to exam-ine, it will be extremely difficult to\nestablish the distance from which\nthe guns were fired.
