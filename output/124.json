So adaptable is aa, that we o an list only a few of bis\na a aerO BS talents. Befitting a President\nef the R.C.S., we will do it in the following sei ent if io Banner:\n(A) Sportsmanship.\nA'22 san of '55 vintage, Peter\nsassier last year attained the spirited\nposition of Hon. Seo. R.C.S. Rugby\nClub. He has also been known te participate in a sedentary game ef squash.\nIn tha I.C. Hostel, the White City ef\nS. Ken., * Peter is a prolific *\na aker of o of fee, except at bed tine when\nhe dismisses all from his a i is i mei with his usual stream of inaudible\n(\u00bb) Woman's men-e hip. Questioning him en the, sub j eot of\nlew s, Peter replied, \"Ad f lams, est of i delia.\",* as is his deeply felt want.\n(0) Ceamittee^am-ahi a. As Lord Chief Justice of H.C. S. he\nis a brilliant oem nd tte e man. This\nstems from his notorious ability to\nneatly sad \u00bb all dl s s sssi on by a just,a understandable \u2014\u2014<-g up ef\nthe situation; tying it up la a parcel\nwith a delectable string of plat it u des, (bull-ril led.) \u2022'\n(\u00bb)\nHe is really quite a geed chap.\nDees force play any part in relations\nbetween nations? Are a ao leer weapons\nse immoral that any catastrophe is pre-fer able? It was with these two momentous\nquestions that Michael Howard, M. C.,M.A. ef King's College, began his lecture\nen the \"Military Implications ef the\nHydrogen Bomb\", at which there were about\n160 present.\nTe the first he replied that we are\nstill in the age ef power polities, and\nto the seo on d he pointed out that\nnuclear power is not so much a question\nof Morality, as of expediency. Such\npower will continue to be necessary until\na World Faroe is set up, and even then\nthis will require some means of asserting its authority. \"We have eaten of\nthe fruit of good and evil, and no amount\nef v omitting will remove our knowledge\nef nuclear energy*. But, su oha World\nFaroe necessitates putting our welfare\ninto the hands of other who have not the\nsame interests, and this is abi ft step\nfar countries with a long history and a high standard of living.\nNuclear weapons nay be divided into\ntwo classes. First, the unusable\nstrategic weapon far attacks on enemy\nterritory only: \"the price of destruction of your enemy is the near des tru o tio of yourself\", and o an such weapons therefore be aa instrument of policy for us?\nThey earn set solely as a passive deter r ent, to be used only if we are threatened\nby others with nuclear weapons, or overwhelming conventional weapons.\nSecondly, there are the tactical\natomic weapons, where the range of destruction is measured in hundreds of\nyards: these are more economical, and\nthe necessary build-up of our forces o an be achieved with them, without endangering ear standard of living.\nThere are three points to consider\nbefore using nuclear force:\n(i) the danger of initiating the use of\nA weapons in those areas of the\nworld where we are trying to make\nfriends (e.g. Asia and the Far East).\n(ii) that most wars in the future will\nse through infiltration, and\ngee in in and civil warfare, where\nwe are at a disadvantage of having\nto operate through bottle-necks.\n(ii l) where to start? If we bomb enemy\nairfields and porta, they will do\nthe same to us, much to our dis-advantage.\nBut the abdication of our responsibilities would not be regarded as a moral\nlead far peace, and would cause the\ndisintegration of our so oie ty, as with\nTurkey in the 19th Century.\nIn answer to a question from the\nfloor, Miohael Howard said that i{ we started sending the Americans home,\nall other countries would do the same,\nresulting in a weakening of the Western\nposition w hio his dependant on the ring\nof American airfields all around Russia.\nWe have no defence except in conjunction\nwith our Allies.\nS.W.7 UNIVERSITY? \u2022 This is a typing sorry.\n(1) Also amp lie a a le(B).( Leak ap sedentary If yea\nhaven't get it yet.)\nnumbers Dictionary definition:\nbringing forth offspring???\n(4) Faithful to Ike end.\n(5) Split infinitive by permission of\nPeeler.\n(6) Ball-filled Platitude: A lease r variety ef the Ornithorhynohas.\nThe motion: \"That there should be\na university of South Kensington\" did not\nraise as m neh heat as Clementine in the\nroad outside, but there were still some\ninteresting points raised, both old and\nnew.\nDr. Coles of Physios, far example,\nbelieved that the artist and scientist\nwho met over o of fee in the morning and\nbeer at night would both be less bored\nin later life, even if they were not\nless boring. That was why he favoured\na union of the Kensington Colleges.\nMr. Basil Taylor of the R.C.A. argued that such an amalgamation would\no a a ee the smaller colleges to be swamped\nby I.C. He could see no bar on communal activities under the existing\narrangement.\nDavid Irving raised a standard\neasiest tha University of London\nadministrations, Imperial College administration sad Sennet. He was particularly displeased with I.C. administration wham, as he put it, \"had not\nappeared to notice the articles in\nFaeemix*.\nAfter an initial mix up with Thar\nsad his ha a aer, Peter Jarman was t on te\nsake oat a delightful ease on the\ntheme:\n\"Life's a pleasant institution,\nLet us take it as it comes\"\n\"What an abortion of a University\nit would be,\" he cried. \"Never before\nhave there been degrees in Chinese\npottery.\" He did not think artists\nmet scientists even in Oxford or Cambridge.\nFrom the floor, John Cox thought\nthat the real need for broadening the\neducation of so ien ti at s( engineers\nespecially) should not be confused with\nthe creation of an artificial university\nadministration.\nThe house rejected the motion by\n18 votes to 7.\nR.D.

    "content": "6 FELIX ROUND & ABOUT\nby Romulus\nI thought that I would have a quick lunch in Queenie' s, There were\nat least a hundred people in the queue.\nI raced round to the union. I knew\nthat I should have to wait at least\ntwenty minutes in the Lower Refectory\nso I went straight for the lift. The\ndoors closed just as I arrived.\nSpeeding up the stairs I passed a long\nover-flow queue from the Dining Hall.\nA glance at the stationary figures\naround the Upper Refectory was suf-fi cie nt.I retreated across the\nQuad, to the snack-bar.\nA short queue here, I only had to\nwait twelve minutes for ay cup of tea\nand a sandwich. Unfortunately there\nwas nowhere to s it down and so I juggled\nwith my plate and cup, contemplating the\nwaste of time spent in waiting for meals\n1ST VARIATION ON A THEME\nby Slg\nQuote of the week:\n\"All I'M interested in is men, and\ngetting a1 st. Class Degree\".\nThis remark, passed by an\nattractive t realise this week, goes a long way to show how wrong the prudes\nare when they bewail the incompatibility of Sport and Work. Consider\nthat sentence: what devotion and?\nunselfishness are here - you may be\nsure, SHE will not waste HER lecture\ntime. This is only just, of course,\nfar the words of learned lecturers\nare not to be taken lightly as you\nwould o astor \u2014oil or aspirin although,\nadmittedly, lectures usually have an\neffect identical with one of those.\nBut in this institution (and I use\nthe word advisedly) wh i oh of you o an say that he has not glanced covertly at\nhis watch as boredom set in, only to\nfind that it is only just 10 minutes\npast? The truth is, of o our se, that\nmost of you are at the stage when your\nhormones are doing the most interesting\nthings.\nWhile the flow of erudite words\nflows far ever onwards and the brown-b agger ahead piles up his ample notes,\nrequests for Hand to oom e into the garden (for no specified purpose) float\neasily into the mind and the pleasant\nday-dream advances no further Mathematically than 38-26-38, an integrated\narea most men would like to approach\nin the limit (asymptotically?).\nThose of you who are One Degree\nUn der not ioe the balance of mind the\nyoung lady shows. Not merely a degree\n(and the best at that) but also research. Research into that sub j eot of\nendless faso i nation to many young\nwomen. I mean of o our se, young men.\nThe squeamish may cry out in anguish,\nbut the hormonal activities of this\n(noble)pile - \"hunt in', shoot in' and\nsecret in'* are everywhere manifest in\nCollege Life - as a walk in rubber\nshoes along the Hostel corridors any\nevening will show.\nIf young men and women of like\npersuasion did not have some outlet,\nthis College would be like a fruit\ncake - full of nuts.\nAt that very moment 300 people\nwere waiting-far meals. At a rough\nguess at least 1000 people wait at I.C. for 10 minutes each day for their food.\nThere are 5 days in the I.C. week and\n30 weeks in the I.C. year, so for those\nwho are mathematically minded it is not difficult to reckon that in one\nyear we waste at least 25,000 hours\nwaiting for meals.\nStupendous - isn't it! A private-eye detective hired by\nthe Department of Un-Imperial Activities\nhas been following ex-President Chad\naround College this week. Without\ndoubt there is proof that Chad is learning to speak Russian. He has been\nseen in the Me oh. Eng. Department on\nvarious occasions carrying a Russian\nprimer. Frequently in dark corners of\nthe laboratory and on the lonely\nstairs he has been heard uttering Slavonio phrases. We know that after a year's Presidency a man tends to fade\ninto oblivion, but we never expected\nthis ar is it, that Chad has a Russian girlfriend?\n.\nThough at I.C. we have an excellent\nUnion of our own with all mod. cons,\nsome I.C. men still have the time and\ninclination to participate in broader\nstudent life at U.L. U. Mr. R, Harford\nis the secretary for the U.L. U. Swimming\nClub, he is the University of London\nbackstroke champion, as well as being\ncaptain of I.C. Swimming Club. Harford\nis the man who distinguished himself\nlast year at the U.L. U. Swimming Gala\nby loosing his trunks - but not the\no hampi on ship. R.J. Loveman, who act oi as Business\nManager for Phoenix, is the Swimming\nCaptain at U.L. U. B.R. James deserves our congratulations for he is\nCaptain of the U.L. U. Association Football Club.\nME OFFICER? SUCCESS A TI.C. To be someone at Imperial College\noffice or membership of a committee is\na desideratum. Research has shown,\nthat this o an be attained by either of\ntwo paths: these we outline now for\nthe benefit of freshmen and others.\nThe Character Route: A comic\nbeard, reputation for indecent exposure,\ndirty shirt worn outside the trousers,\nheight of four feet nine inches ... by\nthe acquisition of any of these conspicuous stigmata it is possible rapidly\nto become known within the college.\nTo be observed v omitting noisily,\ndrunkenly and regularly at lu noh hour\nwithin the Beit Quadrangle is another\nrecommended, albeit well-tried, method\nof becoming a character. Others include\nthe habit of going barefoot to all oo lle ge functions, bringing two or more\nsmall dogs to all lectures and pr act io als, never being seen except when\nao com pani ed by a glamourous blonde\nsix feet two tall and with a382028 figure. Not recommended: noisy home-built oars; a small handcart containing a stuffed effigy of the Domestic Bursar.\nThe Character racket must be played\nfor all its worth: we knew a student\nwho took skis with him wherever he went\nand who finally be o a me assistant secretary of the Chess Club. Useful\nadjuncts to the method should be developed for special use: a man who\nloudly demands the Darts Club pot from\nthe duty officer in the bar will soon\nbecome known. The dirty-shirt trio k works well in literary and mountaineering circles.\nOnce recognition as a character\nis reached office soon follows: Secretary (Fixtures) to the Youth Hostel\nGroup, Vice-President of the Bowls Club,\nmember of the Conmittee of the 23 Club,\nthese and many others are recent successes. The Bar Route: This is expensive\nbut guaranteed. Mark down the President or Secretary of your favourite\nclub or society - for example, the\nPolynesian Club - and buy him a bitter.\nFollow this up with two or three\nbitters a week up to half-session and\nif the official still accepts (he always\nwill) you are assured of getting on\nnext year's committee: this is to\nensure that the supply, mysteriously\ncurtailed at half-session, is continued.\nThere are some people incapable of\nsucceeding by either method: they include the impoverished and the goon-like\nbrown bag gers. However they can get\non by following a further method, the\nClub-of-one's own teo hnl que. Find\ntwo oafs interested in dominoes, sti ok little papers on notice boards and be-hold, a new club with YOU as President!\nUnder-water swimming has accomplished\njust this quite recently: we suggest\na Poker club, Guild of Fretworkers,\nMormon Sooiety, a Numismatists Club\netc seeing what the Union gets\nstung for, all these look like being\nsure-fire hits, getting \u00a3250 a year\nfrom Union funds.\nIf you lack o on find en ce there is still hope. Bribe one who is \"in*\nto mutter \"Old Stumblecrumpet might\nmake a good secretary\" at all committee\nmeetings he attends and, if old Stumblecrumpet coughs up the usual pints,\nhe eventually attains his goal.\nBetter, get two \"insiders\" at this independently \u2014 they o an each report on\nhow the other one is doing and so save\nwoeful waste of Whitbreac,\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX LETTERS DEAD LOSS\nDear Sir,\nWhilst this is an old 017, it was\npainful IT obvious from last Saturday's(ll th) dance that i too ul d stand rep-et it ion. If the I.C. hops are te be\na continued success, the men, who spend\nthe major part of the dance occupying\nthat quarter of the floor by the main\ndoors, must realise that no matter how\nelegant they may look, the girls have\ncome to dance and not see a floor show.\nShould 'lack of women' be offered\nas an excuse, I nay point out that\nthere were plenty of women sitting round\nthe side during every dance, with the\npossible exception of the last waits.\nIt seems that by this time even the\nmost reticent of persons has mustered\nsufficient courage for a last franti o effort.\nFinally Sir, in the earlier part\nof the dan oe, two attractive girls were\nhaving to dan oe together, and one of\nthem, referring to the elegant statues,\nwas heard to ask \"Are they all dead?\"\nThese then, it would seem, are the\ndeplorable depths to w hio hI. C. masculinity - once renowned throughout\nthe whole of the universi-ty - has\nfallen. In the interests of our reputation I ask the people o ono er ned to\novercome their inertia or else occupy\ntheir Saturday evenings with some less\n'hazardous' pursuit.\nTours faithfully,\nBrian Marshall.\nRED HERRING\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to Peter Jarman'a letter \"Seeing Red\", may I clarify soma\npoints. There is an impression in the\nCollege that the Marxist Croup, of their\nown e hee a ing, are using the Literary\nand Debating Sooiety as a front. In\nfact, two years ago we submitted the\no on situ tion of a proposed \"Marxist Foram\"\nto the S. C.C. with the normal number of\nsupporting signatures. The cons it uti on failed to receive the required second\nreading; the opinion of the S. C.C. being\nthat the Marxist Group should function\nwithin the Literary and Debating Sooiety.\nNeither the Marxists nor the L.4D.S. consider this satisfactory. We see no\nreason why any differentiation should be\ndrawn between the Marxists and other poli t ical, religious and philosophical societies in the College. We would point\nout that we have been active for a longer\ntime than, for instance, the Liberals and\nwould ask to be treated with the\nconsideration.\nTours sincerely,\nR.D. Leigh\n(for Marxist Group)\nNO TITLE\nDear Sir,\nI aa sparred on by the delicious\nthough that a Bell B'ly tng Sooiety and\na Marxist Tiddlewinks Group are to be\nfarmed, and I write to propose the\nformation of a No Meeting Society.\nThe a ole object of the No Meeting\nSooiety will be to have no meetings\nand, as sues, it should command the\nsupport of all the brown bag gers. Its\nmembership should reach to an all time\nrecord and it would only be natural\nthat the society should have a grant\nseveral times larger than any other, say\nabout \u00a39578. This grant would be\nspent carefully under the guidance\nof a select committee of about 357 members but as this committee would never\nmeet, I would reluctantly have to spend\nthe money myself.\nI would ask that any of your kittens\nthat are interested in this proposal\nshould contact me through the Union\nRack and I will promise not to reply.\nFinally, I suggest that their\nshould be no meeting of the No Meeting\nSooiety next Monday lu noh tl me at 1\n.\n1\n7\npm in the Concert Hal]Tours honestly,\nJohn Druforth.\nIMPERIAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL\nDear Sir,\nFiery correspondence in your columns\nbetween the President of ICWA and sundry\nmales would never have arisen had the hen'\nof IC a more mature outlook towards the\nladies of the College.\nThe trouble is quite easy to diagnose:\nmost of the male students here are naught\nbut schoolboys at heart, and do not have\na due how to behave in company of ladies.\nThey leer at the ladies and discuss them\nas sex-machines - even with a paltry\nknowledge of this subject - and consider\nthemselves infinitely superior in maturity to their skirted companions.\nAs a result, we find that only if the\nlady is a reasonable sex-machine does any\nmale talk to her - how puerile 1 Come\non IC,wake up, treat the ladies in a reasonable manner, - talk to them a least,\ndo not make them feel like lepers in ao ol ony of Garths, - xe move that idiotic\nschoolboy ban on them entering the bar, -stop calling them' females.'\nThe above, when boiled down is simply\nan attack on the immaturity found rife\nat Imperial Grammar School. Even al though you did leave school one or two\nyears ago, try to forget it men.\nPlease don't steal any mare not ioe sw hi oh have been erected for a definite purpose\nby the authorities - if I see any stuck\non the Beit Building this year I shall\ncry - I can't stand it any more l When you do this, may be the ladies will\nat least want to talk to you. A woman\nof 19 years is more mature in outlook than a man of the same age, so\ndon't give the ladies reason to think\nthey are among a horde of six-former s. Chas Parley,\nBotany II.\nPyjamas have been changing hands\nso rapidly during the last few\nweeks that I have twice gone to bed\nwearing a black chiffon neglig e.I don't mind so much, but I am\ngetting peculiar stares from ray\nfloor-mates and the cleaners.\nNEI am not mentioning anything about\ng the President this week.\noN Quote of the week, from a visiting\n5 American leo ture r:\"I can be just as crude as I like.\nThis is really terrific.\"\nI wander what the context\nI hear that Paul Minton, Warden of\nthe Garden Hostel, who sent a bill C of \u00a355 to three inmates last year\nO for'attaining' a few notices, was\n\u2022 seen struggling with a mammoth sign\nJ some 8ft. by 5ft. outside his door.\nU the other night. Tut, tut Paul\n|yj what would Mr Irving say!\nNI congratulate all I.C. males on\ntheir successful \"Be kind to Gill\"\nweek. Perhaps the I. C.W. A.rians could stage a similar benefit week\nfor the inmate of Room no. 72. He\ncertainly needs one.\nSENEX MILES\nDear Sir,\nAs with many correspondents, \"Senex\nMiles\" rather spoiled his case by overs'\nat lng it. I doubt if more than a few\nstudents at I.C. who have already\ncompleted National Service did so after\nmaking a firm decision to \"Serve their\nCountry first\". Such a decision would\nbe far more likely to confuse the issue,\nfor it raises the usual problem; how\nbest to serve ones oo un try. When\ncleaning the latrines for some quiet\nbackwater of the Army aa'ministration at\nsome reluctant outpost of the Empire,\nthe value of the service to one* count rj thus rendered, can seem low indeed.\nThe whole matter is likely to fade\naway in the next few years, but I too\nwould like to see and hear less of\nNational Service dodging and the\nundignified efforts thus implied.\nBy all means take a course of\naction calculated to avoid National\nServioe, but this should not be\nallowed te become the sole driving\nmotive.\nIt is easy to succumb to the\nblackmail of ones own petty fears,\nand the course of action thus dictated\nis easily rational is ed. Tours faithfully,\nD. G. Clark.\n\n"

The first exchange, of the Unioorn for a \"pretty pink pot\", designed to be\n\"very oom far able and leaving no red Bark\", oo cur red the previous Tuesday (see\np.3). Then the C.A G.

Between yon and the under-signed, hardly any of then could.\nHowever, there is a group of people\nwho certainly Debate, but mainly about\nLiterature, wh i oh they tend to write\nthemselves. They might well be called\nthe Literary and Debating Subgroup of the\nLiterary and Debating Society, after the\nfamous Ministry of Wroks (Works Department)\nbut they are not. They are the Christmas Islanders.\nThey will next meet on Friday\nOotOber 31st at 5.15 pm in the Commltte.\nfi oom* off the Lower Union Lounge.\nThe general purpose of all their\nmeetings is to draw each other's highly\ncritical attention to what they have\nwritten, or indeed to what they have\nread if it is interesting enough to be\nunpopular. Yes, they are an unpopular\ngroup - that is, they are at the\nopposite pole from the Mirror, Presley\nand Mrs. Dale. A lot of people o all them Snobs, wh i oh has been defined aa\nThose Who Refuse to Admit They are\nBored. Perhaps. What the Islanders\nrefuse to do is to tolerate what is\nboring. C \u00bbll them Snobs if you like.\nA fact that only an Islander would\nremember is that John Donne once said\nthat no man ia an island - if you are\nwondering who has died, for whom the\nbell tolls, it tolls for humanity which\nhas lost one of its members, and consequently for you. So if the undersigned\ndrown in the seas of so ien ce for lack of\nsupport it will be your funeral.\ncLEOPATRA At any rate, they are certainly la-landers, living on a piece of land, KJ\nfertile enough for ideas to grow and\nsolid enough for philosophies to be E. built, entirely surrounded by - beer? p Of course, they would not abstain from ~-a treatise on Aloohol as a Means to D Higher Mental States. Any bottle\nwashed up from the surrounding sea is fc\nregarded as interesting until proved Q empty. And the Islanders try not to\ntake anything seriously. The term\nLiterature can be applied only loosely\nto their writings, and they usually\nprefer to use the work paper.\n- Fred Wheeler, more or less on behalf\nof Peter Jarman, Francis Everitt, Peter\nMorgan, David Jones, Robert Palmer,\nGeorge Rlpka.\nOPERATION UNICORN Last Tuesday, a group consisting of\nan ICWArlan, four Guildamen and two R.C.S men converged on Bedford College in broad daylight to o oll eot the Bedford\nmascot .immediately after their lu no ht lae Union meeting. This was the final move\nof a well-Dlanned operation wh i oh had\nin e laded an 'inside survey' of the college by two of the*raiding group the\nprevious Thursday. This was watched\nincidentally, with great interest by a co-operative audience of residents and\nstaff.\nTha raid was organised in the usual\nArmy fashion, each member of the group\nbeing numbered and fully briefed in\nevery move they were to make. The\nfinal instructions were issued ever\ne of fee, after lu noh, in the Hostel, sad\nthe party was back in the same room less\nthan an hour later.\nOperatives 1 and 2 entered the Bedford Ce-im on room and removed the mascot\nfrom it'so as e, placing a suitable\nreceptacle in it'spla oo.

But\nthe lover of the flamboyant, or one with\nthe crying need of a sleeping-bag ,\ngo for a large woolen scarf\nThe reason behind the acquisition\n- a desire to impress on all that you\nare at I.C. and University. i'y main\nreason for buying one was that I got\ntired of the question \" and what's it like at Bedford?\" I defy anyone to\nsay that now.\nThe art of wearing the scarf is\ntricky. Worn straight, it is a sure\ntrip-up or delight of the wind. The\nalternative? Wound around and around\nspitting out mouthfuls of wool or gab-erd in e. Really well wound, one can\nneither hear, see or speak.\nFrequently individuals may be tj pe cast from their scarf. Wound around\nsix times - an efficient disguise or the\nowner is very cold.

LUDLAM.\nIS ATHLETICS TOO AMATEUR ?\nAmateur athletics is governed by\ntha a a at eur def in it ios, an extract of\nw hio his: \"An a a at eur is one aha has\na or a roo a pete d far a saner p rise or\nmonetary consideration in soy Athletic\nSport or Game, er Seen in anyway interested in a staked hat or wager made in\nconnection with say a th let io competition\nin which he was an entrant or oom petit or\". Another Important rale states\nthat \"open setting mast he rigorously\nsuppressed at Athletics meetings\".\nThus at Amateur Athletios Meetings\nthe athlete strives to win for the glory\nof winning alone, urged on by supporters,\nwho hope to share in their hero's triumph,\nrather than take dividends.\nThe crowd and atmosphere at an\na th let ios meeting differs greatly from\nthese at a greyhound meeting. By\nthese rules the sport is kept clean and\na eel thy, untainted by the few undesirable influences money has brought about\nin greyhound and horse racing.\nThere are many arguments against,\nand few far, a circus of professional\nathletes touring countries. The\nathlete may make his living from it, bat it is unlikely he would find satisfaction and enjoyment in his sport.\nRUGBY Hew that two weeks have elapsed\nsince our trials the position and strength of the Rugby Club is beginning to\nclarify. Having a good percentage of\nthe first three teams of last year still incredibly i a College, we have a very\nsound basis on wh i oh to build our sides\nfor this season) because of this strength\nmany fresher s may be disappointed at\nnot finding themselves i a as high a team as they may have expected.\nThe first XV have comfortably won\nthe first four games they have played\n(seal n it rather medial s opposition)\nmeanwhile scoring 90 points, bat have\nget some very tough games to play.\nThe second XT have wen both games\nthey have played beating the U.S. Navy\nin an una saal game last Saturday.\nThe Bx B have also won both their games\nthe ether teams having lest er ne and\nwea er ne each.\nThe new season is notable for a higher rate of scoring sines more open play\nis emo ear aged sad it appears that the\nresulting same is sere enjoyable, sad\npleasant te vetch.\nnow that the sides are\nsettling down together we should have\ns ful season.\nAthletios need never seo ems a full time occupation, provided that there are\nadequate training facilities for athletes\nte use In their spare time. In Britain,\nhowever, apart from London and the\nUniversities suo h facilities are very\nrare; as a result many people do not\nreach international standard.\nIt is right an athlete should\ns aer if ioe to get to the top - it helps\nto strengthen the character. If, and\nwhen, he gets to the top, he may enjoy\nthe free travel to matches in countries\nwh i oh, otherwise, he would never visit.\nIn that respect he is lucky, but should\nthose privileges demand that he sacrifice\nmuch money; as indeed he must, when\npurchasing top class equipment and suit'\nable dress, which he is obliged to wear\nat certain functions.\nAlthough professional (or full-time)\na th let ios is unwanted and undesirable,\nshould an athlete be allowed to a a ke money by indirect means? Advertising,\nbroadcasting, lecturing and writing by\nan amateur are, at present, forbidden;\nthis is rather unfortunate as much good\ncould be gained. Limits, however, must\nbe placed on the athlete's freedom.\nIt is doubtful that an athlete\nee ul d make his living by these means,\nbut I think a limit should be placed\nen what he earns. Some proportion of\nhis earnings could be paid directly to\nthe A.A.A. by the body concerned, thus\nhelping to finance the sport.\nBy these means an athlete would\nhelp the sport, the general public and\nether sportsmen; in addition to compensating for the financial hardship\nhe may have been through.\nDavid Briggs.\nSWIMMING I.C.

The first section was a simple route\ncard out of London to a deserted spot\nnear Dorking, the catch being that a specific average speed had to be maintained\ncontinuously. Competitors were warned\nthat there would be a secret check en-route, but thanks to the marshals, who\nwith great presence of mind joined on the\nend of a bus queue on the Kingston By-Pass,\nonly four oars got through without penalty.\nHaving got so far, the next section\nbegan, and this consisted of a number of\npoints, to be visited in order, with a question to be answered at each. The\nclues given for locating these points varied from spot heights to bearings from\nlatitude and longitude intersections,\ndistances being in some handy unit such\nas thousands of inches, or kilometers.\nHere too was where the weaker competitors\ncame to grief.
