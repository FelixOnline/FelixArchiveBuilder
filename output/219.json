Its control and safety instrumentation, which\nensures that at least three safety circuits are always in use, was designed\nby Elljott Automation.\nThe two people most directly responsible for the reactor and its successful functioning are Dr. P.J. Grant,\nReader in Engineering Science, and\nMr. M. Kerridge, the Reactor Manager.\n-Consort will enable research and\ntraining in nuclear engineering and\napplied nuclear science to be carried\nout by the colleges and medical\nschools of the University as well as\nother educational institutions in the\nLondon area.\nComment\u2014page 4.\nHUXOC TIES UP WITH\nC0MS0C AND CATSOC\nI by CHRIS COOPER\nSPITE OF losing what must surely have been their\nN single attraction, a talk b v Lord Snow, the Commititee\nFun for thee\n- from WRT\nFEARS that \"'Wonderful Radio\nTizard\" may close due to lack\nof support have proved un-founded. Southside resident.\ncan once again look forward this\nyear to 'regular, vital programming\nbesides the continuous music service.\nThe only apparatus required is an\namplifier or radio set, but many programmes are of such high quality that\nthe signals deserve hi-fi equipment to\ndo them full justice. Of course, any\nsubscriber can transmit his own programmes if he has a record player,\ntape recorder or FM tuner.\nIn the past, W. R.T. has been\nfeatured in FELIX and an architects\njournal. Also, a full expose will be\nshortly appearing in \" The Tape\nRecorder.\" This year further strides\nare bound to be made, so be \" IN \"\nfr on f the start. There is sure to be a BIG demand for connection, so contact Jerry Stockbridge (612 Tizard) or\nRog Leaman (476 Selkirk) as soon as\npossible to avoid disappointment.\nJAZZ ON A SUMMER'S DAY\nTHE JAZZ CLUB'S year begins in are mim ni scent mood with an\ninnovation. For at the first meeting on 20th October they are to\nshow the film \"Jazz on a Summer's Day.\"\nIn the' main, however, the year's \u2022\nbusy programme will be run along\nsimilar lines to those of previous\nyears. There are to be \" live \" Cellar\nSessions, lunchtime record recitals\nand, of course, Southside Stomps.\nThe Jazz Club is open to all,\nwhether musicians or not. To musicians the advantages of joining are\nobvious\u2014the club means to form at\nleast one new band this year, and new\nblood will be required for this.\nTo non-mu sfic ian s the advantages\nare mainly financial, for although\nmost of the club's functions are open\nto all the admission fees are lower to\nmembers.\nIf you have not already joined, you\ncan easily do so by contacting the\npresident, Al Friend, via the Union\nrack or by going to the Jazz Room\n(above ICWA lounge) any lunchtime.\nWhat's On\u2014page 8\ngreatest\nof the\nHuxley Society have pr pom is ed an exciting year.\nIt is to include a talk from Professor Denis Gabor on the threats and\nblessings of automation, and joint\nmeetings with the IC Catholic and\nCommunist Societies.\nThis term's programme opens with\na talk on reform of the abortion law\nby Mrs. Diane Munday, who was an\nimt>res sive and moving speaker before\nUL Humanists earlier this year.\nThe British Humanist Association\nhas established tentative links with\nthe Vatican. It is in the same spirit\nthat Catsoc has called for a joint\nmeeting to search for common\nground.\nREINFORCEMENT\nThe Catholics are to be reinforced\nwith women from other colleges and\nthey tell me that\u2014as at normal Huxsoc meetings\u2014there will be a coffee\nparty afterwards for informal discus-sion.\nThe IC humanists' society is named\nafter Thomas Henry Huxley, one-time\nProfessor of Biology here and the\nman who drew Darwin's religious conclusions for him. Later this term\nHuxsoc will hammer out \"Evolution\nor Revolution in Society \" with Comsoc.\nTo round off the term the society\nhopes to hold a sherry party. If you\nhave not joined yet, come to Friday's Freshers' Tea or contact Dave Dunn\n(Physics 3) via the Union rack.\nWhat's On\u2014page 8\nRISING PRICES\nAS A RESULT of a serve y of last\nyear's accounts, there is a rumour\nthat the Harlington catering and bar\nprices will be raised.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCOMMEMORATION\nBALL\nat GROSYENOR HOUSE\n(Ballroom Entrance)\u2014Park Lane\nTHURSDAY 28 OCTOBER 1965\nDancing from 9 p.m. until 2.30 a.m. to the music of\nSIDNEY LIPTON'S BALLROOM ORCHESTRA\nDouble tickets will cost \u00a34 5s., which includes a buffet supper, and are obtainable through application forms from Mrs. Robinson in the Union Office\nreturned by Monday, 25 October.\nThe Biochemistry Block\nOfficial opening\u20144th November\nTO\nWESKER\nCOME TO I.C. IMPERIAL COLLEGE IS CRIPPLED by its lack of an art faculty.\nBecause of this, and its general remoteness from the rest of the\nUniversity, there is little opportunity for its members to meet\npeople with much experience of culture.\nIn this unhealthy atmosphere it is\neasy for the desire .to find out about\nliterature to subside when the student\nmeets a greater pressure of work.\nThe Literary Society exists to combat this problem. It is about 3 years\nold, an inconspicuous and very minor\ngroup. Now, however, drastic internal\nchange's have occurred, a current of\nnew enthusiasm has come about, and\na vigorous programme of meetings is\nplanned for the coming year.\nWe intend to hold a meeting on\nevery Wednesday of the term, in the\nStaff Common Room, level 8, Electrical Engineering Building, at 7.30 p.m. Taking a fearful risk we have arranged\nto have prominent writers, specialists\nin liter a rv affairs, and also a modern\nat these meetings. Our\nis to produce stimulating\ncomposer,\nchief aim\ndiscussions but these will be proceeded\nusually by a talk\" by the guest.\nOur first meeting, on October 13th, has as its visitor the playwright\nARNOLD WESKER, best known as\nthe author of \" Chips with Everything.\" You don't actually have to\nhave read any literature to join the\nsociety.\nWe're not particularly interested in\ncollecting your membership fees\u2014\nthis is something we're forced to do.\nHowever, we are very anxious to have\na large and active gathering at our\nmeetings. You can join the literary\nSociety at its first meeting. "

I trust that all you\nsportsmen (and women) have spent the vac\ntraining hard and have not still got a coat-of last season's mud on your boots.\nNow, a word to the Freshers\u2014The best IC Union has\nto offer is to be found amongst our sports clubs.\nHere informality is the keynote and there is a place\nfor everybody, whatever their standard.\nMost clubs have as many teams as are required to\naccommodate all their members\u2014not vice versa. The\nbest way to fill a Wednesday or Saturday afternoon\nis in the company and friendship of an IC sports\nteam\u2014many think it the only way.\n' non sportsmen \u00bb\nTHE HIGH ACADEMIC standard of Imperial College tends\nto militate against its sporting\nstandard since studying for\none's GCEs takes precedence over\nperfecting off-drives in the use of\nfree time.\nSo we inherit a larger proportion of\n\" 'non-sportsmen than many other\ncolleges. This therefore puts an\nonus on club captains and secretaries to reap the most from the\ntalent they have\nIt is not enough to organise the same\nmatches and training sessions as\nlast year and wait for people to turn\nup. If members are to turn out\ntwice a week, wet or dry, then they\nwant to. enjoy themselves off the\nfield as well as on.\nSuch things do not just happen. They\ndepend upon the personality and\neffort of the club officials who,\nhaving accepted their posts, must\nsacrifice the necessary times and\neffort that go with it.\nFrank Hobson\nAthletics\nNEW WINTER LEAGUE\nALTHOUGH ATHLETICS is main lv a summer sport there are\nto be several competitions\u2014including the new University of\nLondon Winter League\u2014in the coming months. Next summer\nthe Athletics Club not only has a full list of fixtures to provide the\nideal escape from exam worries but also is trying to organise a tour\noj f Germany.\nBut the college team is only one\naspect of the club. As a freshen-who\nis already a keen and training athlete you have no doubt made yourself acquainted with it at the Freshers'\nDay exhibition.\nWhat about those of you who have\nnot seen a running track or javelin\nsince leaving school? No matter what\nyour standard is now there is room\nfor all, and in all but the very biggest\ncompetitions the chance to run, jump\nor throw is given to everyone who\nwants it.\nThe start of the Hyde Park Road Relay, one of ICs big sporting\nevents. The race draws university teams from all over the country.\nYOU MUST BE MAD\nWHO, OTHER THAN A LUNATIC, would spend every Saturday and Wednesday afternoons staggering around the countryside through blizzard, fog and flood. However, there is always\na personal triumph, when, despite the numerous Acts of God that\nare combated en route, you crawl the\nlast few yards of a race to finish\n746th, which in some translations\nmight appear devoid of honour.\nBut, one might remember, the gentlemen whose corpse you crawled\nover in that fighting finish. He would\nbe placed 747th should his soul\nmarch on posthumously.\nIn its travels I.C.'s Cross-Country\nClub visits Oxford, Cambridge,\nMountain Ash, the Peak District,\nBrighton, Sandhurst, and plans are in\nhand for a continental fixture. London matches take us to Hampstead,\nTwickenham, Barnet, Shenley and to\nour home course at Richmond Park.\nOur most important event is the\nHyde Park Road Relay. We organize this race, which is effectively the\nnational college relay championships.\nIt is always intensely exciting and perhaps you are the person to help the\nclub return to the form, which made\nus winners three years ago.\n\"We welcome all types of runners\u2014\nfast, medium, slow, very slow and\ncrawlers. I don't think I'm sticking\nmy neck out by suggesting you come\nin one of these categories and if so\nwe need you.

For\nsome years now the IC Boat Club has been the most successful\nin the University of London.\n1964/5 was a reasonably good sea-son, but new members are urgently\nneeded if the club's standard is to\nbe bettered, even maintained. Those\nwho have rowed before are very we l come, but experience is not essential.\nA further incentive is offered in\nthe form of a month's free trial so\nthat prospective members may see if\nthey like rowing and if it fits in with\ntheir other pursuits.\nThe boat house, on Putney Embankment, has really excellent facilities,\nranking among the best in the country.\nFor exercise, healthy relaxation, and\nfriendship you should seriously consider taking up rowing or sculling.\nSmall, lightweight men are always\nrequired as coxswains, who may also\nrow and scull if they wish. Coxes\nqualify for a special reduced annual\nsubscription, at which (at 2 gn s. for all\nother members) is considerably less\nt 'lan the fee for any other club of its\ntype in the home counties.\nBILLIARDS & SNOOKER\nT HE ABILITY TO PLAY Billiards or Snooker is said to be a sign of a mio-^ent youth, and\nfor all who wish to put this\namongst their achievements the I.C.

He has\nbeen our Union porter for six years\n\u2014quite a long time for him to stay\nanywhere, but he says he likes it\nhere. As a whole he has quite a good opinion of students, though\nsometimes they can be rather trying.\nThe son of a Barbadoes business\nman, he studied classics at school,\nand eventually started his working\nlife as a school teacher. Two years of\nthis, however, convinced him that\nteaching was not the career for him,\nbeing neither lucrative nor sufficiently\ninteresting to one who yearned for a more adventurous life. Far horizons\nwere beckoning, and it was natural\nthat he should try his hand at life\nafloat.\nHis mother had been a concert\npianist, and Stan himself had played\nthe piano from an early age, so that\nhe joined the Canadian National\nSteamship Line as a pianist, in 1937,\non their luxury cruises. He sailed\nwith this line for four years and\nmanaged to see a great deal of the\nworld before his employment was abruptly ended when his ship was torpedoed off Burmuda at the beginning\nof the war.\nThis seemed like a good cue for a change of profession and he went to\nCuracao in the Dutch West Indies\nwhere he trained as a cracking unit\noperator with the Shell Oil Company.\nAfter the war Stan re-joined the\nMerchant Navv as a steward for a short time.\nBut soon he was off again on his\nwanderings, this time roaming about\nNorth America, trying his hand at a variety of jobs, working most of the\ntime at his old trade, playing the\npiano in night clubs.\nHowever in 1955 he had ambitions\nof studying Law so he decided to\ncome to England. During his sailing\ndays Stan had visited most of the\nworld, and had come to the conclusion that England was the only place\nto live, in spite of the weather.\nBefore coming to IC in 1959 Stan\nworked for a time in a Brewery.\nLater he joined the Decca Radio and\nTV Company and also managed to\nput in three years part-time service\nwith the Territorial Army.\nHe has not altogether dismissed his\npast accomplishments for whilst he\nhas been here he has played professionally at the Engineers Dinner and\nDance and the ICWA Formal.\nYou cannot tell a book by its cover.\nSo, too, would you perhaps not expect such a varied past to Stan the\naffable man at the Union door.\nINTERESTED IN\nASTRONOMY\nATHEISM ?\nATHLETICS ?\nThen come to the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\n13 Prince's Gardens\nfor a book about it.\nOpen 11\u20145.30 daily (11\u20147 on\nTuesdays and Thursdays)\n\n"

CHA 6081\nComment\nby the\nEditor\n1 \u2022\nIs Second Rate better\nthan SecondHand?\nAT THE TIME of Consort's opening at Silwood the New\nScientist exposed that without DSIR's initial outlay of about\n\u00a3100,000 London University could have had a nuclear reactor\nwith 50 times as much power for free\u2014and three years earlier. However, we at IC should be grateful that DSIR chose to place the\nreactor in our charge, for its presence should further add to our\ngood name in industry.\nWhen the AEI Company offered the Aldermaston Merlin, Consort's designers\nhad only recently changed their thinking from the Mark I10 kW reactor\nto the Mark II 100 kW version. Apart from those of the Atomic Energy\nAuthority, Merlin was the first British designed and built reactor in\nthe United Kingdom.\nThis offer was not taken up, and the opportunity to pio vi de the universities of\nthe south of England with a training facility of great versatility and a research facility of great power three years before Consort was sadly\nmissed. .\nIt may be argued that Merlin was a second-hand instrument, and as such\ninefficient. But\u2014if this is indeed the case\u2014surely also a reactor of such\na low output as Consort is inefficient. Another argument that may be\npursued might be that the design of nuclear reactors has advanced considerably since the time that Merlin was conceived\u2014which, as a layman, I am prepared to believe.\nBut Government departments are rarely credited with good sense, except in\nterms of saving money, and it is surprising therefore that in the face of\nsuch a tempting offer DSIR did not abandon the expensive Consort\nproject and accept AEI's invitation.\nOn the facts that are available, it seem lud i cro rus that this grant-giving\nauthority\u2014now renamed the Science Research Council-\u2014can squander\nmoney so recklessly on such schemes, but has been so unwilling to help\npost-graduate on tnc bread-and-butter scale, by raising their grants to a more realistic level.\nWhy Two Carnivals P It is high time that a Union Meeting had a long discussion on the whole\nsubject of the timing and organisation of our Carnival. Thursday 21\nOctober would seem to be as good an opportunity as any, so how about\nsomebody preparing their case ?\nTHE IC CARNIVAL BOARD recently announced that in addition to\nthe ii mk iI Carnival Week in May they are to introduce a Rag Week\nin November. The present plans for this November Rag Week appear\nto be somewhat half-hearted, with few special productions to compare\nwith those of May to be held in the Union, boosted outside only by\ncollections, which normally begin at this time of year.\nFor many years organisers of IC Carnival have appreciated that May is\nnot the best time of year to attract the degree of support which it deserves\nfrom the College due to the proximity of of the examinations. The creation of a second Carnival Week should not therefore be a priority.\nMy own impression of the populace of South Kensington is that, with some\nnotable exceptions, they begrudge our very presence. Does it therefore\nseem likely that they will welcome not just one but two weeks of sheer\nlunacy on the part of our Commandoes\u2014and dig deeply into their\npockets ?\nSo far as we in the College are concerned, the Autumn Term calendar of\nevents is full enough already without the addition of such a dominating\noccasion. Quite apart from this busyness, this term is the costliest\u2014in\nterms of new text-books, club subscriptions and Christmas presents.\nIt seems to me that the Carnival Board are letting themselves in for a lot of\nunnecessary work and wasted time. Undoubtedly, the best place for the\nIC Carnival would be at the end of the spring term. This is well clear\nof exams, which should not raise the usual recruiting problems, and there\nis at least a50 per cent, chance of fine weather.\nWANTED\nfor murder\nCOLCUTT\nApplv in strict confidence to\n96 Beit\nDO SOMETHING\nIN PREVIOUS FIRST ISSUES Felix editors have made their welcomes\nto fresher s in the most prom'nen t positions. Though lower in order\nof place in this editorial, the greetings are just as great and sincere.\nEach year's influx of students enables the College and students' union\nto continue re-en erg is ed. By now enough has been said of the happy balance between \" work and\nplay \" by representatives of both academic and Union sides of IC, so I have no need to repeat this very worthwhile advice.\nHowever, I feel that it is essential to emphasise the extracurricular aspect of\nCollege life. For, despite any appearance to the contrary that may be\ninterpreted from our pages during the year, far too many Union clubs and\nsocieties are \" sick \" through lack of support. It has been said that at least\nhalf of the students at IC take no part in the Union other than to obtain\ntheir midday meal.\nStudent apathy is not a characteristic peculiar to this College. It is\ncommon to all universities. The Union is the students, and it is the\nresponsibility of every student at Imperial College to make some non-monetary contribution, however small, to the Union's well-being. The\nnew Yearbook is a valuable introduction to 1CU, but it is entirely up to\nthe individual to make the first move; in an institution of our size, the\nclubs cannot all come to him (or her).\nOnly through communion with other students\u2014sharing tasks, exchanging\nviews, \" leading the flock \" will you be able in three years' time to say\nquite honestly, \" I have led a full College life.\"\nDO NOT WISH to dwell on changes or improvements in Felix since last\nyear. To th os fc of you now in your second or third years these should be\nobvious. But the standard can only be maintained by a strong staff. No\nlonger can this newspaper be run by a triumvirate as it was when I first\ncame to IC\u2014it has become too big a business.\nLast year we had a\" full-time \" staff of about 30, and were very grateful to\nthe numerous \" part-time \" colleagues. As you can see ;ib ove a number of\nmajor vacancies remain, so anyone with even the slightest inclination\ntoward publishing or business should contact me without delay at room\n96 Beit Hall or at one of our Tuesday staff meetings in the Press Room.\nIf you just want to \" do something\" non-academic\u2014you're not sure what\n\u2014you'll render us a great service, even if you can't construct a sentence,\nby doing a few reporting jobs for Felix, in the course of which\u2014who\nknows\u2014you may find your dream. And next time you hear anyone\nsay, \" Another bloody awful Fel'x,\" just send him to 96 Beit. I shall\nbe pleased to hear his views on improving it.\nS IN THE PAST the Editor\nwill be pleased to receive from\nreaders letters intended for pub-li cation. However, the editorial board has the right to withhold\nfrom publication such letters either in\npart or in toto.\nMANY THANKS\nI WANT TO WRITE at once to express my own thanks and the\nthanks of the Notting Hill Housing Trust for all the work which\nyou and your colleagues lia ve put in to produce the total of over\n\u00a32,400 for our work.\nWe are very much aware of the immense amount of work which was involved\nin your raising such a large amount of money as this and we are immensely\ngrateful to you all. With the College's gift the Trust will he able to do\nnearly \u00a3\\5,000s worth of work\u2014by taking advantage of all available loans\naid g~~t ts we are able to make each gift pound do the work of six.\nIn human terms this means that the results of the 'College's work will be that\na' lea*' ten families\u2014who are now living in conditions of extreme overcrowding or who are actually homeless\u2014will have a good, simple permanent home in which to start life afresh.\nBRUCE KEN RICK (Rev)\nChairman. Notting Hill Housing Trust, W.W. THEN AS NOW t IN 1934 H.G. WELLS wrote of Imperial College :\n| // is today a huge fung oid assemblage of buildings and schools\nwithout visible centre, guiding purpose or directive brain. It h 'ts\nbecome a constituent of that still vaster, still more conspicuously\na cephalic monster, the University of London.\nThe thumbs y wisdom of the practical man, with a conception of life based\non immediate needs, un analysed motives and headlong assumptions, and\nwith an innate fear of free and searching thought, is still manifest at a hundred points in the structure and working of this great aggregation.\nThe struggle to blend technical equipment with a carefully cherished illiteracy,\nan intact oafish ness about fundamental things, has been well sustained.\nSouth Kensington will still tell you proudly. \" We are not literary,\" and\nexplain almost anxiously that the last thing it wants to impart is a liberal\neducation.\nThe ideal output of the Imperial College remains a swarm of mechanical,\nelectrical and chemical business smart ies, guaranteed to have no capacity\nfor social leadership, constructive combination of original thought.\nThe Imperial College was and still is in fact not a college but a sprawl of\nlaboratories and classrooms. Whatever ideas of purpose wrestled together\nin its beginnings are now forgotten.\nIt has no firm idea of what it is and what it is supposed to do. That is to\nsay, it has no philosophy. It has no philosophical organisation, no\nsocial idea, no rational is cd goal, to hold it together.\nI had come up to South Kensington persuaded that I should learn everything.\nI found myself in South Kensington lost and dismayed at the multitudinous in consecutive ness of everything.\n\n"

In spite of\nbeing one of the worst seasons in recent years, they managed\nto complete some routes without any major accidents.\nIn the first week there was not\nmuch success, an attempt by P. Scott\nand P. Hawthorne on the Mer de\nGlace Face of the Grepon in the\nChamonix Aiguilles ending in defeat.\nYet all but P. Roberts, A. Marie and\nG. Tough, who were in Zertnatt at\nthe time, managed an enjoyable climb\nof the N.W. Ridge of the Aiguille\nde I'M. Subsequently the weather and the\nconditions of the snow became very\ntreacherous but a few routes were\nmanaged. There was only one minor\naccident where R. Rowe had a slight\nfall on the glacier above the Converde\nHut, while returning from a successful attempt on the Eveque with K. Harrison, a member of Leeds University.\nOther completed routes included the\nEast Face Direct of the Aiguille du\nMoine (G. Tough and P. Scott),\nConzy route on the Aigulle le I'MG. Tough and \" Jug\" Jarvis,\na Mountaineering Association Instructor), and the West Face of the Pointe\nAlbert (P. Scott and A. Legge). The\nlast of these climbs is Extrement\nDifficile, the highest Alpine grading,\nshowing that some of the members are\nas competent in the Alps as on Welsh\nRock.\nViolent snow storms foiled an attempt by Tough and Jarvis to make\nthe third British ascent of the North\nFace of the Aiguille du Triolet. Hawthorne, in his first alpine season,\nascended the Aiguille d 'Argentiere\nwith his own party\u2014a big undertaking\nat anytime.\nAfter a mammoth unsuccessful attempt on Mont Blanc, the party\npacked up and left for Britain, arriving back on the 24th of September.\nAlthough there were many disappoint-ment s, the club had an enjoyable\nmeet. The president would like to\nthank the new club van for making\nthe journey there and back so trouble\nfree.\nUnion\nLounge\nRedecorated\nTHE LOWER LOUNGE of the\nUnion Building is to be officially reopened by the Rector,\nSir Patrick I in lead, on Friday\nat 5.30.\nThe redesign has led to many improvements in the furnishing, lighting\nand services of the lounge. Perhaps\nthe most important innovation is the\nextension of the bar, which will\nserve sherry and cocktails as well as\nbeer, so making the Union Bar, or at\nleast a branch thereof, amenable to\nwomen.\nMore room for Engineers\u2014\nMech.

    "content": "FELIX Moroccan underwater expedition collecting some valuable zoological\ndata in the Mediterranean. The 18-man expedition aboard converted fishing\nvessel \" Boy Mark \" was led by T.A. Bowman. After some minor engine\ntrouble was overcome, all considered this summer's expedition a great success.\nPolish Impressions\nby Rovers\nTWELVE MEMBERS OF the IC Rover Crew went on this year's summer camp in Poland. The train journey to Warsaw was\nbroken at Berlin where we split into groups and spent a morning\nwandering around the western sector admiring the new building\nschemes and bright shopping areas.\nApart from one party just missing\nbeing involved in an accident on the\nrailway everything went smoothly\nuntil the Friedrichstrasse check point.\nAfter some delay here we were\nfinally let into the eastern sector and\nsoon learnt that taking photographs\nnear the wall was forbidden. The\ncontrast between west and east was\nbrought home to us more by the reserved and almost sullen behaviour\nof the population than by the goods\nin the shops or by the appearance of\nthe buildings. That evening we set\noff again for Warsaw and after a comfortable kip on the floor of the\ncompartment saw our first glimpse of\nPoland.\nOurfirstimpression was the extreme\nflatness of the country, the only hills\nbeing near the Czech or Russian\nborders. The harsh realisation that\nthe exchange rate was heavily biased\nagainst us came when we had to buy\nour first \" Polo grub.\" 24 hours or\nso in Warsaw was spend acc lim at ising ourselves to the currency, seeing the\ncity and discovering that no-one had\nheard of paraffin or primus stoves.\nThen we set off for the Polish lake\ndistrict near the Russian Border via\nGdansk. Travelling on Polish local\ntrains is an unforgettable experience;\nvirtually no trains run during the day'\nPRICE FIXING\nALL \" HOP \" BAR prices are to be\nstandardised. In some cases these\nwill be above normal Union Bar\nprices.\nand those that travel overnight are\npacked solid, as it appears to be a national paSs tim c and transport is very\ncheap. Our time in the lakes (for the\nmost part literally) was spent sailing,\nswimming and walking in the surrounding (almost English) countryside.\nWe spent the second part of our\nholiday in the south of Poland based\nnear Zankopane. Here we went\nwalking and scrambling in the Toctra\nMountains which go up to 8,000 ft.\nalong the Polish-Czech border. It was\nmost reassuring having come down a rather in noc cuo us\" path \" to be told\nthat someone fell off there yesterday\nor to be told by a Pole speaking\nEnglish with an Irish accent, \" Sure\nevery bloody thing in this country is\nillegal.\"\nThe ways were for the most part\nclearly marked and were fl h ly dangerous when snow covered the track.\nOne hazard which\u2014to our cost\u2014we\ndid not allow tor was thunderstorms.\nOne Group had reached a saddle\n7,000ft. up when a storm broke and\nlightning struck, both at the top of\nthe ridge and also below them.\nHaving eventually decided that the\nsafest place to be was in the open\nthey sat on the hillside and several of\nthe group felt electric shocks every\ntime the lightening struck.\nWe returned to London also by\ntrain and one of the lasting impressions of our stay was the difference in\nattitude between the Polish people,\n\u2022who could not have been more\nfriendly or helpful, the East Germans\nwe had met earlier.\nLiving\non a Shoestring?\nNever mind, it can't last for ever. And while you are\npreparing to make your first million, it's just as well to\nopen an account at the Midland Bank. For an account\ncan help you now\u2014when help is needed most\u2014to\nmanage your money affairs more easily. More important,\nit will go on helping you as your money problems\nchange through the years (for money problems\nnever cease, however rich one becomes\n\u2014they merely assume a different form).\nSo make the wise decision today: have\na word with your local Midland branch.\nThe staff will be glad to help you \u2014 whether\nyou're ever likely to make a million or not!\nMidland Bank \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 THE BANK THAT KEEPS AHEAD \u2014ON YOUR ACCOUNT\nHead Offiee: Poultry, London, EC2\n\n"
