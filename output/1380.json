But the latter are more photogenic. Well, easier to find\nShooting down shooting stars\nESA, the European Space Agency, certainly can\u2019t be accused of being faint-hearted. The recent appearance of a\ncrater in the Peruvian Andes, widely\nattributed to a meteorite, may at face\nvalue seem to be an event so unusual as\nto remain permanently in the \u201cActs of\nGod\u201d category. Even if it turns out that\nthe crater, said to have emitted noxious\ngases, was due to a meteorite, trying to\ndo something to prevent impacts may\nseem to be a fool\u2019s errand.\nIt could be argued that, laying fictional concerns (Kryptonite) and solutions (Bruce Willis and a large nuclear\nweapon) aside, any realistic solution\nwould hardly come cheap, and would\nuse up valuable resources better\nspent on dealing with more frequent\ndisasters.\nBut this down-to-earth (ahem) point\nof view is a classic example of our\nlimited ability to deal with what Nassim Nicholas Taleb has termed black\nswans, in his recent book The Black\nSwan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. He takes the eponymous\nfowl as a rather innocuous example\nof our limited ability to deal with infrequent events \u2013 the European as-sumption, based on experience, that all\nswans were white seemed reasonable,\nuntil the discovery of black swans in\nAustralia. (The pedants amongst you\ncan object that young swans are grey,\nbut if you\u2019re going to get picky, we\u2019re\nprepared to argue at length that they\u2019re\ncygnets. And besides, you\u2019re missing\nthe point. Concentrate.)\nTaleb argues our assumption that life\nnever strays far from under the skirts\nof the bell-curve extends far beyond\nornithology, and means we are unable to correctly assess the risks (or\nbenefits) presented by many unlikely\nevents, even if they have far-reaching\neffects. Crashes in the stock-market\nand best-sellers are two examples,\nbut so are meteorite impacts \u2013 arguing that a meteorite impact powerful\nenough to wipe out humanity is so unlikely as to be negligible skirts over the\nfact that, by definition, just one such\nevent would be enough \u2013 statistical\nimprobability is of cold comfort to an\nastronomer with a \u201cdinosaur-killer\u201d\nlooming into sight.\nRecent studies should limit such\nnasty surprises, and help improve\nInspired by a wannabe Iberian knight, ESA takes a chivalrous approach to large lumps of space debris\nour understanding of the statistics of\nspace debris. A worldwide network of\nastronomers is cataloguing asteroids\nwith diameters above 1 km, and other\nstudies are planned, so that up to 90%\nof all near Earth objects above 140 m\nshould be being monitored by 2020.\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\nImproving our knowledge of the\nthreat presented by the smaller rocks is\nnot an easy task, as it is hard to monitor their orbits (and hence predict their\ntrajectories) from the ground, and as\nsuch they may represent a greater dan-ger. However, we can take heart from\nthe fact that their size may make these\nobjects easier to deal with, if observations suggest any are likely to collide\nwith Earth.\nThis is all very well in theory, but\nactually knocking a threatening asteroid off an impact trajectory is likely\nto be significantly harder in practice,\nespecially without prior experience of\ncourse alteration. Accordingly, ESA\nhas been planning a mission to do just\nthis, checking the effect present technology can have on an asteroid with a\ndiameter of about 500 m.\nDubbed Don Quijote, an appropriate moniker given the approach the\nagency is considering, the mission will\ncomprise two spacecraft, Sancho and\nHidalgo, and if approved, will launch\nearly in the next decade. Sancho would\narrive at the target asteroid first, after\ntravelling for a little over two years,\nand would spend several months\nmonitoring the asteroid\u2019s shape, posi-tion, mass and gravity field.\nHaving taken a different orbit,\nHidalgo would arrive later, and would\nuse a high-resolution camera to steer\nitself towards the asteroid, impacting\nat a nippy 10 km/s. Sancho will record\nany changes in the asteroid\u2019s position\nwithahighdegreeofaccuracy,andwill\nthen release a small package of instru-ments, which would passively free-fall\ntowards the crater left by Hidalgo, to\naid in determining the chemical, thermal and mechanical characteristics of\nthe asteroid surface.\nA number of asteroid are currently\ncontenders for the dubious honour of\na run-in with Hidalgo, but the frontrunner is Apophis, which caused\na scare in 2004, as initial measurements suggested it might collide with\nthe Earth in 2036. Although this was\nsubsequently ruled out, the finding\nserved as a sobering reminder that asteroids present a danger which should\nnot be ignored, and which call for the\nbold approach espoused by missions\nsuch as Don Quijote. Taking a tilt at\nan asteroid may seem an act worthy\nof the Hidalgo himself, but the knowledge gained may well prove invaluable\nshould a genuine threat arise.\nAt the end of their tether\nIn other space-related news, an experiment on the ESA Foton-M3 mission\nhas had partial success in an attempt\nto master technology just as significant\nfor space science as Don Quijote.\nThe \u20ac2.7 million Young Engineers\u2019\nSatellite 2, project (which went by the\ngo-getting acronym of YES2) involved\nmore than 450 students, who worked\non developing the 36 kg payload in\nconjunction with Delta-Utec, the\nprime contractor. The aim was to deploy a 30 km tether from the satellite,\nthe longest ever used in space.\nIn theory, tethers present an attractive way of man\u0153uvring payloads in\nspace. The most outlandish designs\ncall for thin ribbons built of very strong\nmaterials, extending from a planet into\nspace. Known as beanstalks or space\nelevators, these cables would allow\npayloads to be lifted into orbit without\nthe use of rockets. Any giants (or Vermicious Knids) reading this can rest\nassured that unfortunately, there are\nseveral barriers to using these tether\napplications on Earth.\nHowever, their satellite-based cousins look far more promising: as reported in Nature News this week, payloads\non satellites can be returned to Earth\neasily using tethers, as they allow the\npayloads to be slowed sufficiently as\nthey are lowered, without the use of\nretro-rockets.\nTo be light enough to be practical\n(a key consideration in all space mis-sions) the tether needs to be very thin,\nrequiring it to be made of very strong\nmaterial. The tether on YES2, a mere\n0.6 mm thick, used a polyethylene fibre\ncalled Dyneema, allowing it to weigh\nin at only 5.5 kg, slightly lighter than\nthe 6 kg capsule and heat shield it was\nreturning to Earth.\nAccording to the preliminary mis-Cosmo Kray\nNot quite the sort of tether and payload they had in mind\nsion report on the YES2 website (www.\nyes2.info), the first stage of the deployment went to plan: 3.4 km of tether\nwere released, with software exerting\nconsiderable control on the deployer\nmechanism, to keep tether oscillations\nto within ~10o of the ideal vertical\nposition.\nThe problem occurred in the second stage, as friction from unknown\nsources caused the rate of deployment\nto slow significantly, and led to 15-20o\noscillations before the preprogrammed\ncontrols cut the tether. This meant that\nin total, only 8.5 km of tether were re-leased. Although this was short of the\ntarget, the report concluded that the\noperation was still a success: it represented the first tether flight for over a\ndecade, and achieved over half the mission goals. The team is currently looking for the capsule, thought to have\nlanded in Kazakhstan, so as to improve\nfuture mission analysis. Ask Borat?\n\n"

Copyright \u00a9 Felix 2007.\n\u00a3384,000 skeleton in\nUnion finance closet\nUnion budgets are already under strain\nthis year after an audit of the Union\u2019s\naccounts brought to light a mysterious lack of reserve funds. The deficit\nof \u00a3384,000 was traced to a decision\ntaken two years ago to dip into the\nGeneral Reserve, an amount designed\nto keep the Union financially solvent\nin the case of a catastrophe, in order\nto partially fund Phase 1 of the Beit\nMasterplan.\nThe Masterplan is the long-term redevelopment plan for the main Union\nbuildings and Quad that started work\nin summer 2006, and is designed to\nupdate our ageing facilities. The decision to dip into the fund was taken two\nyears ago by Union Council, which at\nthe time was the supreme governing\nbody of ICU, under the control of Union President Sameena Misbahuddin\nand Council Chair John Collins.\nInvestigation into this allocation\nof funds is ongoing, but there is confusion over how such an ill-advised\ndecision was taken by the 2005/06\nSabbaticals with so little discussion\nappearing in the official minutes, and\nwithout a vote being taken specifically\non the issue. The current Union Deputy President responsible for Finance &\nServices, Chris Larvin, has stated that\nthis decision \u201cshould never have been\nauthorised,\u201d as it has left the Union\nGeneral Reserve with only \u00a3400,000\nat present. The estimated \u201chealthy\u201d\namount for the Union Reserve is just\nunder \u00a31million.\nRevelation of this substantial financial hole so early in the year has hit the\nUnion hard, and could affect spending\nfor several years to come. \u201cIt looks like\nwe\u2019ll all have to tighten our belts this\nyear\u201d, said Union President Stephen\nBrown. Spending controls are expected to be tightened across the Union\nfollowing the news that it is considerably less financially secure than it was\noriginally thought. Clubs and Societies\nare being urged to only spend if they\nare certain that they can afford the expenditure from their current balance.\nHow long it will take the Union to replenish its emergency reserves remains\nto be seen. The extent of the damage\nis still being calculated, and initial reUnion\u2019s emergency fund spent on Beit Quad redevelopment\nports on repercussions are mixed, but\nan air of caution pervades the Union\nuntil a full assessment is completed.\nThe hole was discovered following\nscrutiny of the Union accounting system prior to an updating of our currently arcane financial arrangements.\nSources close to Beit Towers (home of\nthe Union Sabbatical Officers) say that\nthis lack of diligence by Council is precisely the reason that the Trustee board\nis being created and given supervisory\ncontrol of major Union expenditure in\nthe future.\nAndrew Somerville\nNews Editor\n\u201cPay up or the mascots get it\u201d\nIn the first week of September, Engineers from the City and Guilds Union\n(CGCU) were responsible for the pilfering of the Royal School of Mines\u2019\n(RSM) mascot, Davey the Davy lamp.\nThis is the beginning of the revival\nof City and Guilds to its former glory\ndays, after the poor management it saw\nlast year.\nThe Rules of Mascotry, which has\nbeen all but dead for the last five years\nat Imperial, allow theft of the \u2018violate\u2019\nmascots of the Unions for the purpose\nof raising money for Raising-And-Giving charities, in the form of a ransom\ndemand payable to IC RAG. The rules\nexist to promote friendly rivalry between the colleges, all in the name of\nfun and sportsmanship.\nDavey is being held to ransom for\n\u00a3200 (rising to \u00a3300 after 11th October), and is being stored in a secret\nand inaccessible location to prevent\nthe miners being able to steal it back\nwithout paying their dues. Alongside\nthe monetary ransom demand came\nanother humiliation for the RSM: to\nconcede their loss, the historical society of the Geology department, \u201cDe La\nBeche Society\u201d, named after the RSM\u2019s\nfounder, is to be renamed \u201cGeoSoc\u201d for\none year.\nThe raid came only one week after\nDavid Charles, the RCSU\u2019s Vice President (operations), was heard denouncing mascotry as dead and claiming\n\u201cnobody cares about it any more\u201d.\nInitially, Davey\u2019s minor counterpart\n\u201cPractice Davey\u201d was also stolen, but\nhas since been returned as it is inviolate and thus not allowed to be stolen,\nafter meetings with Danny Hill of the\nRSM, in exchange for the return of\nthe CGCU President\u2019s tankard to their\nplace behind the Union Bar.\nDavey and Practice Davey are pictured alongside Spanner, the 43-year-old CGCU mascot, a solid brass spanner weighing in at 64lb.

It is a wonderful, varied\nand very extensive collection. Make a long day of it.\nBest Bits:\nThe Egypt Galleries are a definate highlight and the Rosetta Stone has been famously on display since it\u2019s\n\u2018discovery\u2019 in 1802 and was most recently translated by Rachel Weisz in The Mummy Returns: a cinematic\nmasterpiece.\nThe famous Reading Room in the centre of the Great Court in the museum, which has the dubious\npapier-mache dome and entertained those well-known bookworms Oscar Wilde and Karl Marx, has been\nexpertly transformed temporarily into a tomb-like exhibition room to tell the story of the First Emperor\nof China, Qin Shihuangdi. He was an inspiring man \u2013 he buried the architects of tomb alive with him and\ncreated the Terracotta Army, some of which are on view at this must-see exhibition. You can see these warriors (all 8,099 of which are different) eye-to-eye which is quite humbling seeing as they are over 2000 years\nold and still seem as though they could beat you in a fight.\nThe National Cartoon Museum,\nLittle Russell Street\nAre cartoons for kids? Yes. Are you over thirty-five with a mortgage and misgivings about\nyoung people? No. So you\u2019re well within the age range to have some fun here. Students go\nfree, and there\u2019s a lot of cartoons that vary from political to slightly less serious \u2013 though fans\nof Mickey Mouse might be disappointed. Well worth a look on your way back from The British Museum, which is just down the road.\nBest bits: A huge archive of Punch comics, showcasing very definite styles of political satire\n\u2013 you might not get most (or even all) of them, but the visuals make it as appealing as a visit\nto the V&A. They also run classes both over the Summer and during term-time, so if you\u2019re\nbored of labwork and want to get out the colouring pencils again, it might be a good place\nto head for.\nJust around the corner from the museum is the Gosh Comics store, which will serve your\nneeds for anything more modern, too.\nDesign Museum, Shad Thames\nA good 10 minutes walk across the river from Tower Hill lies a small, pretentious museum\nwhich charges you to see what is ultimately on display in the V&A shop. With a heavy emphasis on modern designers and up-and-coming talent, it has some nice, open design spaces.\nNot one for agrophobics.\nBest bits:\nIf you\u2019re after freebies, the museum is currently playing host to London Design Festival\nuntil the 14th October featuring several Designers in Residence of the Design Museum. If\nyou have a free day, Sarah van Gameren\u2019s Big Dipper, to be installed in the Riverside Hall,\nmechanically creating 24 candle wax chandeliers by dipping strings of wick in heated wax\nand allowing a frame to build up over a period of 12 hours, inviting the viewer to witness the\nbirth of a product: the Design Museums\u2019 equivalent of watching paint dry in slo-mo.\nNext Week \u2013 Theatres\nThe Imperial War Museum,\nLambeth Road\nWithin walking distance of Waterloo station, the Imperial War Museum is a frightening collection of exhibits from\nnumerous wars, including some particularly impressive collections of Second World War pieces. Large, but absorbing,\nthe IWM also has some seasonal exhibits on \u2013 currently, a display of camouflage and it\u2019s effect on warfare.\nBest bits:\nThere are a few unbelievable pieces hiding away in the museum \u2013 hunt out the replica of Little Boy, the nuclear bomb\nthat fell on Hiroshima, as well as the bronze eagle that was taken from the top of the Reichstag in Berlin, bullet holes\nand all.\nThe Secret Agency exhibit is mostly entertaining, but the end is particularly good, showcasing a lot of recent events\nand asking some interesting questions. But for hard-hitting, you can\u2019t beat the photography on display in the Second\nWorld War sections. Incredibly moving images, presented in a thoughtful manner \u2013 well worth tracking down.\nWritten and designed by Rosie Grayburn\n\n"

But we can\u2019t think of any puns\nA\nnother fantastic evening\nout at one of London\u2019s\nmost pleasant theatres,\nthe National theatre on\nSouthbank gives us The\nEmperor Jones by Eugene O\u2019Neill. This\nplay would have certainly had jaws\ndropping and eyes widening at the\ntime O\u2019Neill (an American favourite)\nreleased it onto Broadway for the New\nYorkers and indeed those who flocked\n(and still do) to one of the world\u2019s leading theatre districts.\nFirst performed in 1920, it saw the\nfirst black actor on stage, performing\nthe lead role: of a leader. Certainly, this\nreflected the pioneer within O\u2019Neill\nwho would challenge political and racial assumptions in his work.\nAlthough the play covers with the\nway in which black people were treated\nin 1920s America, racism is not a key\nissue here. The themes of dictatorship\nand tyrannical rule, leading to eventual\ndownfall are more prevalent. (O\u2019Neill\nwrote this play over a decade before\nthe rule of Hitler and Stalin came to\npower).\nThe play follows the self-proclaimed\nEmperor Brutus Jones (\u201cstowaway to\nemperor in two years!\u201d) and his own\ntyrannical rule over the people of Haiti, after his escape from the States following the murder of a prison guard.\nBrutus\u2019 own self-importance blinds\nhim to the hatred which is people feel\ntowards him.\nPaterson Joseph undoubtedly stole\nboth the stage and the whole show\nin his captivating portrayal of Brutus\nJones. What Joseph gives us is a completely convincing and highly comical\ninterpretation of the self-important\nand cocky stowaway-turned-emperor.\nThe deep-south accent and Negro\ndialect (which at times becomes slightly \u201cgospel\u201d) is pulled off flawlessly and\nunfalteringly. Joseph has us laughing\nthroughout the play at Brutus\u2019 antics\nand witty banter, and also rigid in our\nseats as we take on his fear and desperation listening to his manic ramblings\nduring his voodoo encounter.\nWe can only wonder at how Joseph\nmaintains such vigour and energy in\nhis role. One finds oneself growing\nvery attached to Brutus as we share in\nhis journey, feeling sadness and distress throughout his ordeal and final\ncapture.\nHuge praise must go to the direc-tor, Thea Sharrock and indeed the set\ndesigners, musicians and light technicians without which this mesmerizing\nThought about outdoor sports?\nGot a sense of adventure?\nFind us & our free climbing wall all day in Beit Quad at the\nfreshers fair.\nUNDERWATER CLUB\nImperial College Trust has been supporting worthwhile activities within the College since its establishment in\n1968. The activities of the Trust are funded by donations and by the careful stewardship of existing\nresources and the Trustees meet on a quarterly basis to consider grant applications from members of the\nCollege. In recent years, the Trust has made a significant grant to the Imperial College Union to support the\nrefurbishment of Beit Quad and has also made a number of smaller grants to clubs and to individuals.\nFunded by ICU Recreational Clubs & IC Trust\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc\nICU Recreational Clubs &\nUnsettling even to watch, the visual effect of The Emperor Jones is undeniably impressive, made all the better by brilliant performances\nproduction would neither have been\npossible nor so potent. Nothing could\nhave created the illusion of voodoo\nmagick better than the spectacular\ndrumming which really brought chills\nown ones spine.\nAnother highlight of the production\nwould have to be the pyrotechnics followed by the witch doctors impressive\nand slightly frightening display. The\nplay certainly has a sinister and highly\nsurreal- even \u201ctrippy\u201d \u2013 edge to it and\nat times one felt as if we had stumbled\nin on an experimental theatre production which only furthered enjoyment\nand added depth.\nRight up until the last deafening\ndrumbeat, the audience is left spellbound as if, indeed, under some voodoo spell. Certainly one of the most\npowerful pieces of theatre I have ex-perienced, those lucky enough to have\nseen it are truly blown away. The seventy minutes zoomed by and I urge\nALL to go see it as soon as possible.\nThe Emperor Jones runs until 31st\nOctober.\n\n"

Try this\nbalanced workout to help you build\nmuscle and improve overall strength,\ngetting you ready for more advance\nworkout later on. Best performed 2\ntimes a week for 4 weeks along with\nother workout days. Aim to work out\n3 times a week at least, and never the\nsame muscles twice in two days.\nEvery work out should consist of a\n5 min warm up on the treadmill followed by at least 1 warm up set of your\nfirst exercise. If you looking to get \u2018big\u2019\nwork for the burn, the burn which lets\nyou know you\u2019re really working.

This exercise targets glu-tes and hamstrings, but acts as an all\naround body workout.\nStand erect holding the barbell just\noutside your hips with your feet hip\nwidth apart. Using an overhand grip\nlean forward by pushing your hips\nbackwards as the bar slides down your\nto mid shin level and your upper body\napproaches parallel to the floor. Reverse the action by pushing your hips\nforward as you exhale at the top.\nThe final exercise will give your arms\nan amazing pump\u2026 a sign of things\nto come if you keep at it! Using the\ncable machine with a bar attachment\nperform sets of 8 reps of the bicep\ncurls. Once you complete that move\nstraight into rope pulldowns, focusing\non spreading your arms apart in the final half of the movement. The final set\nshould be completed to failure\u2026 i.e.\nwhen you physically cannot perform\nthe exercise.\nEnjoy the work out, revel in the burn,\nand soon you\u2019ll be reaping the reward\nin the mirror.\nExercise Sets Reps Rest time\nSquats 4 8,8,6,6 1 min\nBench press 4 8,8,6,6 30 sec\nRomanian deadlift 4 8,8,6,6 1-2 min\nDumbbell row 3 8,8,8 1min\nBarbell curls superset\nwith rope pull down\n4 8,8,8, to failure\n(of each)\n20 sec\nFelix takes no responsibility if you\nbreak yourself in half whilst trying\nto lift weights that are clearly too\nheavy for you.

    "content": "fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFriday 28 September 2007 felix\nFashion\nLondon Fashion Week gets ethical\nFrom organic cotton Tees to fairtrade shoes, eco-fashion was the word on everyone\u2019s lips at LFW\nHannah Theodorou\nKatherine Hamnett\u2019s\nback with her groundbreaking statement\nT\u2019s. Tackling\nissues as\ndiverse as\nwar, religion\nand the\nenvironment,\nthese classic boyish\nT-shirts have been\nseen on everyone from\nLily Cole to Liz Hurley.\nThey\u2019re available online\nor from most Urban\nOutfitters stores.\nSave the Rainforest T-shirt\n\u00a340\nwww.katherinehamnett.com\nI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so exciting when\nthe ticket to London Fashion Week\ndrops into my inbox. The word fashion\nseems to grate nerves at the moment \u2013\ndisposability seems to be the key with\neveryone from Primark to Asda spewing out catwalk copies at rock bottom\nprices. Primark sold a quarter of a million military jackets in 2005 while Tesco sells 30,000 pairs of \u00a33 jeans a week.\nCharity shops can no longer deal with\nthe rate at which items are turning up\nat their doorstep, some of which are\nunworn. These cheap items are hard\nto shift however \u2013 when people can\nbuy them for next to nothing at the supermarket next door few want to rummage through overburdened rails at\nOxfam The rate at which these unsel-lable items are turning up on the doors\nof charity shops is unprecedented \u2013\nthe fact that charity shops are turning\nclothes away is a sign of the bad shape\nthe industry is in. When clothes aren\u2019t\non rails or in wardrobes they end up in\nlandfill.\nAll these reasons and more mount up\nto the reason I am tired of seeing the\nVictorias and Paris\u2019 flaunting the latest\ntrend. And why I applaud those who\nappreciate a good investment when\nthey see one. Why buy 5 soon-to-be-binned items at \u00a35 a pop from Primark\nwhen the same can be spent on a versatile organic T-shirt which will see you\nthrough at least the next 4 seasons? It\u2019s\ntime to question how we can buy jeans\nfor \u00a33 when we know the people who\nmade them were bullied into making\nthem for next to nothing.\nWhen I trotted round the exhibition\nstands at LFW in my never-out-of-fashion because it was never in fashion\ndress and vintage boots it was interesting to see how people responded when\nthey saw the title \u201cFELIX \u2013 THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\u201d emblazoned under my\nname if I had forgotten to strategically\ncover it (mental note \u2013 must get last\nsection removed for February). Most\nscrewed up their nose and feigned\nan interested smile while they peered\nover my head for Vogue\u2019s style editor\ninstead. Not so at Esthetica, the Ethical\nfashion exhibition now in its third run\nat LFW. It showcases designers who\nhave put thought into more than just\nsecuring their place at the front of the\nfashion pages. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re\nnot worth a fashionista\u2019s attention. The\nbrands featured have been seen on the\nlikes of Lily Cole, Liz Hurley, Keira\nKnightly and Natalie Portman. They\u2019ve\nall earned their place at the Esthetica\nkstands through attention to things like\nthe source of their materials, the rights\nof the people who made them and how\nlong they will stay in a person\u2019s wardrobe before being turfed out.\nLeading the crowd was Katherine\nHamnett whose iconic T-shirts have\nbeen making headllines for years. Each\n100% organic cotton top is made in India where workers recieve a fair wage.\nSo if you think \u2018Leaders Suck\u2019 or that\nyou should \u2018Choose Life\u2019 head down to\nUrban Outfitters or visit her website to\nget your hands on one.\nHighlighting the hazards of the cotton industry, The Environmental Justice Foundation campaigns for safer\nworking conditions for cotton growers.\nCotton makes up 40% of world fibre\nconsumption, but it is also one of the\ndirtiest. Its heavy reliance on hazardous chemicals poisons farmers, soil\nand water.\nOther brands such as \u2018From Somewhere\u2019, \u201cWorn Again\u2019 by Terra Plana\nand \u2018Gary Harvey\u2019 work almost entirely with recyled materials giving a\nnew lease of life to factory leftovers\nand candy wrappers. Now there\u2019s food\nfor thought.\nDolly Delaney\nThis winter the catwalks are all pointing towards the masculine office suits,\nmilitary coats and the strong silhouette.\nWith all the male orientated apparel\ngracing our wardrobes, the only way to\nkeep your look from drowning in testosterone is to add a few choice pieces\nof bling. London Fashion Week was the\nperfect platform for budding jewellery\ndesigners to exhibit their wares. Alex\nMunroe was the clear winner when it\ncame to elaborate design. Inspired by\nhis love for wildlife, the Autumn/Winter collection is a must for anyone who\nwants a little bit of the great outdoors,\nin their small indoors.\nClara Francis is another designer\nto look out for. Her innovative use of\nbeads to form various animals as neck-laces, which not only look chic but also\nmodern, is something that I thought\ncouldn\u2019t be done. The ex-West End\nperformer decided to teach herself old beading techniques,\nduring the long gaps between\nperformances. Francis\u2019 collections have recently featured in\nElle, Cosmopolitan\nand Vogue.\nAll that glitters makes up the best of the rest\nFancy mingling with\nthe fashion crowd?

What I want you to do first is\nsurf to your favourite website. Really.\nGo on \u2013 actually do it, don\u2019t just read\non and spoil the magic.\nNow, be honest \u2013 are you on Facebook? If you\u2019re not, skip on a paragraph\nor two. Otherwise, put your right hand\nin front of the monitor, fingers spread\nout and palm facing towards you. Yes?\nOkay, then stare at the gaps between\nyour fingers, and move your hand very\nfast towards you, so that it slaps you in\nthe face, as hard as possible. Do it a few\ntimes, just to get the feel of it. Are you\nwith me yet, or would it be easier if I\ncreated a \u201cFirst Up Against The Wall,\nCome The Revolution\u201d group and invited you to it?\nHere are the things that terrorism\nis responsible for bringing into my\nlife \u2013 occasional worried phone calls\nfrom my mother. And that\u2019s really\nabout it. Here\u2019s what Facebook users\nare responsible for bringing into my\nlife \u2013 constant, unending badgering by\nothers to join inane, curly-fingers-quo-tation-marks \u201cpolitical\u201d groups about\ncompletely fuck all; page after page of\npointless writing in the papers and on\nnews sites covering \u201cthe power of the\ninternet\u201d as if email had never been\ninvented; the dullest conversation I\nhave ever, ever had, involving the latest\nFacebook meta-gossip; Madeleine sodding McCann; and probably worst of\nall, the four-in-a-million retards who\nhaven\u2019t joined Facebook, ostensibly as\nsome ridiculous statement of personal\nintegrity, but really because they can\u2019t\ntrust themselves not to start posting\nphotos of their nipples, who delight in\nimpressing their \u201calternative choice\u201d\nupon me every waking hour of every\nday.\nWhoop-di-do. You discovered social networking. Here\u2019s how you find\nout what my \u2018Favourite Movies\u2019 are if\nyou\u2019re a Facebook user \u2013 you become\nmy friend. And I don\u2019t mean you click\non a strip of text and write something\nin a box about me having really nice\neyes, or thinking you knew me from\nsome club in north Wales. I mean you,\nyou know, talk to me and get to know\nme and things. Don\u2019t get the wrong\nend of the meme here \u2013 I\u2019m just as up\nfor buying into internet-based group\nmasturbation as the next student. But\nunlike the rest of the Imperial \u2018network\u2019 on Facebook, I\u2019ve managed to\ncontain my burning desire to share my\nrelationship status with half of South\nKensington and some moron from\nNew Jersey. People I don\u2019t know aren\u2019t\nlisted as my friends; do you see the\nsubtlety here? I don\u2019t list my favourite\nmusic for my friends to see, because\nmy friends already know what that is.\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re my friends. It\u2019s like\nhow when a burly gentlemen standing outside Tesco at midnight asks\nyou if you\u2019re on your own, you don\u2019t\nsay, \u201cWhy yes, I have no friends in the\nimmediate area and am a little bit lost.\nAlso, maybe you\u2019d like to know my top\nthree Orlando Bloom films?\u201d Instead,\nyou walk on, because hey! That\u2019s kind\nof how society works.\nI don\u2019t care if you think it\u2019s a good\nway to meet new people. So is serving\na jail sentence for indecent exposure,\nbut we don\u2019t spend our lunch hours\nattempting that, do we? Nor do I care\nif you think it\u2019s an upmarket version\nof MySpace \u2013 at least the people on\nMySpace knew they were geeks with\na self-respect lobotomy. Facebook is\nMySpace, but with any shred of entertainment sucked dry, replaced with a\nblue-and-white colour scheme, and\ngiven a copy of The Sun to read.\nHonest to god, a cursory glimpse of\nmy News Feed tells me that people I\nknow \u2013 people I have been in the same\nroom as \u2013 have joined a group for \u201cHot\nChinese Girls\u201d. Now, there are literally\nmillions of ways to connect to other\nhuman beings on this planet. Religion.\nPolitics. Being born in the eighties. But\nno, we\u2019ve actually chosen to hook up\nwith people who have a thing for Far\nEastern women in tights. Awesome.\nOne up for the next generation.\nBut you don\u2019t care, and neither do I.\nBecause frankly, if you\u2019re on Facebook\nfor seven hours a day, at least I know\nwhere to avoid you.\nA brief overview of the RCSU\nI\nt\u2019s that time of year again\u2026 In\nthis edition of Felix we extend\na very special welcome to the\nfreshers! Good luck in your first\nfew weeks and make the most of\nthem! We\u2019d like to encourage you all\nto come along to our freshers\u2019 events\nincluding a comedy night, a pub crawl,\na classic sports day (egg and spoon\nraces \u2013 wahey!), a bowling night and\nof course the Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) Freshers\u2019 Ball at Zoo\nBar & Club just off Leicester Square\n(\u00a35 in advance including champagne\nreception, two free vodka red bulls\nAND a chocolate fountain!) For more\ninformation about these events, including dates and times go to www.\nrcsu.org.uk!\nSo, What is the RCSU then? Well,\nIC is basically divided into three facul-Jennifer Morgan\nPresident\nties. The engineers, the medics and of\ncourse, the scientists! Each faculty has\nits own constituent union under the\nbig umbrella of Imperial College Union. The faculty union for the scientists\nis the RCSU, with over 4,500 students.\nThe RCSU was founded in 1907, following the merger of the Royal College\nof Science (RCS) with the Royal School\nof Mines and the City & Guilds Institute of London into the Imperial College. With the disappearance of the\nRCS as an independent institute, it\nwas felt necessary that all students of\nthe Sciences at the new Imperial College be represented by a union which\ncarried on the name and spirit of the\nRCS. Despite a little disbanding which\nhappened several years ago where the\nRCSU was split up (a silly period which\nwe won\u2019t go into) however, we were\nsuccessfully reformed last year!\nOK, history lesson over, what does\nthe RCSU do? The RCSU committee coordinates events and activities\nfor all of the science students, as well\nas providing an academic and welfare\nrepresentation network. We also have\nour own publication called \u201cBroadsheet\u201d filled with student news, useful\ninfo and generally things to keep you\namused during your 9am lectures! We\nalso have a national essay competition,\n\u201cThe Science Challenge\u201d which was set\nup last year and proved hugely successful drawing in thousands of applicants\nfrom Imperial students and Sixth Form\nstudents from across the country. New\nto this year will be RCSU sports teams\nwhich you can register your interest in\nat our website.\nWe have a brand new office this year\non the Sherfield Walkway and we\u2019ve\napplied for funding to revamp it with\nsome new furniture and general office looking paraphernalia so it should\nbe looking the business very soon! So\ncome in for a chat so we can show it\noff!\nOver the coming year the RCSU is\ngoing to use this column to keep you\nup to date with what we\u2019re up to (so\nlong as Tomo lets us keep it!)\nAll science students are automatically members of the RCSU but if you\u2019d\nlike to get involved with the committee\nor if you have any queries at all please\nfeel free to email me at rcsu.president@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to wish you the very\nbest of luck for this year! Come and see\nus at Freshers\u2019 Fair and feel free to pop\ninto our office at any time.\nH\nello strangers. Welcome (back) to Imperial. Firstly, a thank you\nto everyone who voted\nfor me during the election in February. You\u2019ve given me a\nfantastic opportunity and I intend to\nkeep my side of the bargain by producing a quality newspaper for you to read\nthroughout the year. I hope you all enjoyed the Maoam and lollipops!\nFelix has undergone a bit of nip and\ntuck over the summer period. Hopefully you\u2019ll find that the cat is a sleeker\nbeast now in terms of design.\nThis year\u2019s team is relatively inexperienced compared to previous years.\nA lot of the members that joined last\nyear have risen through the ranks to\nbecome section editors and we also\nhave a number of writers and editors\nwho started this week.\nA. Geek\nThat\u2019s not to say they\u2019re any less capa-ble! The team is enthusiastic and we\u2019re\nstriving to bring you a more creative\nFelix. We have a number of features in\nthis issue, more for the following issues\nand some ideas in the pipeline as well.\nIf you want us to dress up your club or\nsociety\u2019s tour reports just like the Fellwanderers\u2019 one later in the issue, send\nyour articles and some nice high resolution photos to felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nThe Felix website has also been updated with some of the content from\nthe Freshers\u2019 Special Issue. Head to\nwww.felixonline.co.uk to have a ganders and take the Freshers\u2019 Personality\nTest where you can clearly define your\ncharacter by answering ten easy ques-tions. We\u2019ll try to keep it updated regularly with articles from the newspaper\nand of course the Horoscopes will be\nthere so that you can get your weekly\nfix of insanity each er... week.\nIf you\u2019ve got something to rant about,\nwhether it\u2019s Union politics, something\nCollege has done or if you want to try\nand make people laugh, these are the\npages designed for you.

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n42 Friday 28 September 2007\nfelix\nSport\nFiona Jamieson\nHockey club success on Cyprus tour\nparty was to celebrate the two Rich\u2019s\ndegree results. The acclimatisation\ncontinued the following day with some\nof us hitting the beach and others playing mini-golf, we were trying our hardest to take in the local culture! We tried\nour hand at beach volleyball but were\nrubbish and when swimming in the\nsea both Chaz and Ellie stepped on sea\nurchins. Already we had candidates for\nthe muppet award!\nThe evening took a slightly different course than predicted as whilst\nplaying a game, Chaz managed to hit\na rock and get a huge gash in his foot.\nAfter much struggling we dragged him\nto hospital for five stitches. Maybe not\nthe best start to the tour! So whilst the\nothers enjoyed the first of the karaoke\nnights, three of us waited in hospital\nwhile Jack and Sammy had an evening\nout with their water pistols for com-fort. Whilst Mary, Bacon and Doug\nhad been in a bar open until 6am, the\nrest of us played buckaroo with Harry;\nwe managed to tie his hands and feet\ntogether, put a boat, a wig, Willy, pompoms and an entire goalkeepers kit on\nhim before he woke!\nFinally on the Wednesday we managed our first game, with Ollie as\ncaptain, against Styx, a British Army\nteam. We got off to a shaky start, with\nthe Styx scoring within the first two\nminutes. I think we were all struggling with the heat, and that includes\nthe cripple crew who, thanks to Chaz\u2019s\ninjury, had grown to three, however\nthis may have been because Sammy\nand Fi undertook an alternative warm\nup; 8 drinks from a man who looked\nlike Howard the Halifax man. But how\ncould we resist at a pound a drink?\nAnd anyway, Sammy\u2019s cheerleading\nwas much improved by it! Team tactics\nchanged throughout the match and\nit was decided that we should change\nfrom playing rolling subs to swapping\nthe entire team, leading to a little rivalry between team A and team B. This\ncaught the opposition off guard and\nallowed Kavit to show us that he deserves to be promoted into the 2s next\nseason as he was a little running, scoring machine. The final score was 7-5 to\nIC, our first win on tour in three years!\nThe goal scorers were Kavit with 3 and\nJack, Bacon, Rob and Andreas with one\neach. Man of the Match had to go to\nKavit for his amazing goal scoring and\nDick of the Day went to Chaz for being a completely useless umpire. We\nheaded back and quickly had our fines\ncircle before splitting into two groups.\nOne lot were going for an \u201cearly night\u201d\nand ended up staying up til 4am playing\nnaked cards. Mary was sober for these\nfrivolities and the quote of the night\ncame from her \u201cI\u2019m naked, I\u2019m sober,\ngive me a beer!\u201d. The rest of us headed out into Agia Napa. We started in\nBedrock where we were joined by the\narmy guys. Francis tried his hardest to\nchat up the blonde from the opposition\nonly to find that she had taken more of\na liking to Fi than to him! Moving on\nfrom there we worked our way down\nthe road to Senior Frogs where we met\na family from Doncaster out with their\n12 year old kids at 2am! Jack caused Fi\nto have sticky tits and Ellie once again\nclaimed to have perfect breasts. This\nsaw us on our way to River Reggae, an\noutdoor club with a pool, surely mixing alcohol and water was not the best\nof ideas? Anyway no one had come in\ntheir swim stuff so underwear it was!\nThe fun continued \u2018til the sun came up\nwhen we left to go to bed and the army\nguys left to go to work! It was here that\nthe sharking really started.\nThe R&R after our first match was\nspent at Europe\u2019s largest water park.\nThis was what Myra had been waiting for. It was a great day out and once\nagain the lurid green t-shirts proved\nuseful as your could see us from the top\nof the rides! You were also able to hear\nMyra\u2019s screams all round the park; who\nknew someone so small could make so\nmuch noise?! The evenings entertainments were provided by House Blackie\nand their karaoke attempts. Fi ran the\nbus many times, much to Mary\u2019s dis-appointment, and Francis once again\nproved why he deserved his title as he\nstropped when playing cards, probably still devastated because the pretty\nblonde turned him down.\nWe left Agia Napa to move onto the\ncapital Nicosia. We sampled local culture by going to the north of the island.\nNot only is it occupied by Turkey, but\nwe discovered that the beer was much\ncheaper too. That went down well as\nthere were more exam results being\ncollected that day.\nThe mixed tournament we were\ndue to play was cancelled due to the\nextreme heat, so instead we played\nagainst the English School, ESOBGA;\nAndreas\u2019 and Alex\u2019s old school. The\nmatch got off to a much better start\nthan the last one, maybe because James\nlead us in dynamic stretches. However\nthe final score to this was only 2-1, both\ngoals again being scored by Kavit. Man\nof the Match was originally awarded\nto Shiv but, as she didn\u2019t actually play\nthat well, Fine Master over-ruled this\nand it went to both Myra and Sarah\nfor their great defending. Dick of the\nDay went to Richard Francis for playing air hockey and completely missing\nthe ball in the D and hence missing out\non a goal. Special mention has to go to\nLuke who decided to take the keeper\non and managed to floor him, and also\nmanaged to get a fairly impressive war\nwound to show for it.\nAs it is so hot in the capital the locals retreat to the coast, which is what\nwe did. Alex arranged a fantastic boat\nparty for us so after sampling the local\nequivalent of McDonalds, we headed\naboard the boat. We set sail into the\nMediterranean Sea and partied hard.\nThe best dancing must go to Sarah\nwho danced like a loon with the glow-sticks and her and Sammy managed to\nbreak a bench by getting a little carried away. Apparently Alex proposed\nto Sammy too, but I missed that one,\npossibly because Harry spent about 10\nminutes trying to persuade me to put a\nglow-stick down my throat. She didn\u2019t.\nThe freshers couldn\u2019t stand the pace\nwith Kavit, Mala and Sammy all taking\nnaps at the end. Though Sammy may\nhave been faking and just using it to get\nclose to Ollie. More sharking?\nAfter a collective 50 hours sleep between us all, we turned up to the match\non the Sunday a little worse for wear.\nEveryone was tired, apart from Andreas who had been boring and not\ncome to the party. This match was\nagainst the Lions, who had just won\nthe league, they were to be our toughest opponents and it happened to be\nwhen we were at our worst, but we put\nup a fight. If we hadn\u2019t been so tired/\nhung-over and if the umpires didn\u2019t\nneed to run off for a TC, we could have\ndone better, but the final score was 3-6\nwith Kavit once again proving his scoring abilities by getting two and Jack got\nthe other. Man of the Match went to\nLuke for being one of the few people\nthat could actually run and having far\ntoo much enthusiasm considering how\nlittle sleep we\u2019d had. Dick of the Day\nwent once again to Francis, apparently\nfor playing badly, but he claimed it was\nall Mary\u2019s fault. I think someone is in\ndenial.\nThe post match celebrations were\nfalling asleep and were a little lame\ncompared to normal. The evening saw\nanother fines circle in which we were\nthe first to the pub at 9pm. We also\nmanaged to find another IC student\nhidden away in there.\nThe final leg of our tour took us to\nLimassol, once again on the coast of\nthe island. On Tuesday it was Ollie\u2019s\nbirthday, so we started off with some\nculture and went to an ancient amphi-theatre, it was there that Jack had an\nunfortunate incident with a hole. This\nwas followed by a trip to the beach\nwhich proved to be the perfect warm\nup for our last match.\nOur final match was against another\nBritish Army team, this time the Exiles. This was an important match; all\nthree injured members were allowed\nto be on the pitch, making sure that\neveryone had actually played on tour.\nKavit once again got the game going by\ngetting us off the score sheet. Fi came\non the pitch to goal hang and managed\nto set up a goal for Mala. In the second\nhalf Sammy took over the goal hanging and Chaz also made it onto pitch.\nBacon, Andreas and Joe all got goals\nto see the final score being a whopping\n5-0. Not a bad way to end the tour. Man\nof the Match and also Champagne Moment goes to Francis for putting in a\nvital tackle in defence and if that wasn\u2019t\nenough he ran half the length of the\npitch to get there. A rare sight. Dick\nof the Day went to Sammy who managed to put her foot through one of the\nbenches in the grandstand.\nThe last fines circle of tour was messy\nwith the usual fines and traditions being carried out back at the hotel. Special mention to Chaz who was the\nmost annoying member on tour at that\npoint and proving why he\u2019d earned his\nGrandmaster title. The frivolities continued inside with Bacon proposing a\ngame of 3-man. If this wasn\u2019t enough\nhe won the game and was very smug in\nthe process.\nThe last day of the tour was spent\nchilling by the pool making the most\nof the sun and playing mini-golf, showing that we are all very serious about\nsport, no matter which one. Bacon\nwon again.\nFor the final evening we went to a\nrestaurant and had a seafood meze\nwhich, whilst being tasty to some,\nwasn\u2019t for everyone. Its amazing how\nmuch fun can be had with prawns and\nbattered fish. Dinner overlooking the\nsea was the perfect place to give out\nthe tour awards. Harry won the Nudist\nAward for his willingness to get naked\nat any time, Sammy won the Drunk\nAward, pretty self explanatory, Chaz\nwon the Muppet Award, once again no\nexplanation needed and Kavit got Top\nScorer. Woman of Tour went to Myra\nfor being so enthusiastic and Man of\nTour went to Andreas for all the work\nhe put in. Tour god went to Fi but the\nmost import award was tour couple,\nwhich went to Bacon and Francis for\nsharing a bed for a week and complaining when they got split up in Limassol.\nIt must be love.\nIt just has to be noted that there was\nrather a lot of bed hopping whilst away,\nincluding from those who you would\nleast expect it. Shiv only spent one\nnight in her own bed and, by doing so,\nkicked Fi out, Sammy tried her hardest\nto shark Ollie and hence swapped with\nBacon. Whilst it was just Fi and Bacon\nthat went to sleep in one room, it was\nFi, Bacon and Sammy that woke up\ntogether and no one knows how! Ollie\nwas locked out in Agia Napa and slept\non a chair outside his apartment and\nKavit made a bed out of three chairs\nwhen he couldn\u2019t get in.\nThat concluded this years summer\ntour for the Hockey Club. I would like\nto say a huge thank you to Andreas and\nAlex for all the work that they have put\ninbecausewithouttheirknowledgeand\nhard work Fi would have been so very\nlost. Also to the IC Trust for sponsoring our brilliant kit and to the Hockey\nClub for their help and support.\nFirst night meze with the unmistakable lime green t-shirts\nGroup photo with the British Army Exiles team after a convincing 5 \u2013 0 win in Limassol\nContinued from back page\n\n"

    "content": "Paul Banks from Interpol, playing an early evening slot on the mainstage. Kings of Leon guitarist, giving the gladeye\nReading Festival vs. Pukkelpop\nFelix braves eight-hundred miles of driving and two major festivals to investigate rumours telling of\ncheap entry, decent line-ups, good food and campsites not made up of mountains of festering rubbish\nHoney Munroe (Photos by\nGreg Mead and M-A)\nWith similar line-ups and just a week\napart, both are loveable and fabulous\nin their own right, but this year Felix\nwent the whole hog and bowled into\nEurope just in time for one of Belgium\u2019s\nlargest music festivals, Pukkelpop, and\nthen ambled back in time for British\nsummer\u2019s last hurrah at Reading Festival. You could be forgiven for thinking\nof Pukkelpop as Reading and Leeds\u2019\nyounger though physically bigger\ncousin, but I have a feeling if you scaled\nReading Festival up the same capacity many might not survive to tell the\ntale! Reading held 80,000 people where\nPukkelpop had 130,000 and 194 bands!\nYet there is something about the sloping intimacy of the Reading site that\nmakes it seem absolutely overflowing\nwith people as well as bigger than it actually is while somehow though larger,\nthe layout of the Pukkelpop site was\nsuch that it did not seem the 10acres\nbigger and the stages always seemed\nmoderately packed but not rammed.\nFor those of you who do not know\nanything about Pukkelpop, the Belgian\nfestival began life with one stage hosting seven bands and just three thousand people on a football pitch in 1985.\nFrom humble beginnings to having\nseen almost all major names in alternative rock of the past twenty years, the\nfestival has been going from strength\nto strength with a burgeoning dance\npresence in the last decade. This year\nof 2007 saw The Smashing Pumpkins\nreunite to headline almost all major\nsummer festivals worldwide, making\ntheir third appearance at Pukkelpop\nsince 1993.\nThe main site of the Festival is pretty\nhuge and very heavily sponsored. Mobile phone banners and Coca Cola emblems are everywhere but at least it is\non the whole tastefully done. A lot of\ntime, money and effort has obviously\ngone into not only the organization but\nalso the construction of the site. The\nstages are huge and the tents are enormous and boast sound quality you can\nonly dream of experiencing back home.\nThe Dance tent was the most awe inspiring thing, as big as an actual club\nback home in London and fully fitted\nwith screens at intervals that dropped\ndown along the ceiling and the most\nincredible scalectrix track of moving\ngreen LED lights above you this was\nperfectly designed and certainly the\nmost ubertastic dance tent I have ever\nbeen in at a festival. The second dance\narena was almost as big, an actual tent\nwith funnelled tops and an impressively and decorated inside with enormous\nglass baulbauls splattered with random\ncoloured paint markings and balloons\nhanging form the top.\nThe attention given to the dance\nareas clearly mimics the popularity\nof dance music and I have to admit it\nseemed if not the most popular genre,\nas popular as the rock music side of\nthings. It makes Reading\u2019s dance stage\nlook like a muddy tent in someone\u2019s\nback garden by comparison and really\nmade me think how shameful it is that\nafter all this time Reading and Leeds\nhave not revamped their tents, or at\nleast invested in some really well laid\nones with decent flooring which could\ntransform the atmosphere entirely.\nThe Campsite was situated on a massive area of fields that had been trans-formed, for the duration of the festival,\ninto sea of tents. You had to physically\nleave the festival site and cross a busy\nmain road to get there, but Police were\non hand at all times to halt traffic at intervals allowing a safe passage to and\nfrom your tent. This minor inconvenience was soon forgotten once inside\nthe camping area however. Ample\nspace was kept ordered with many a\nsteward directing campers into spots\nso that the site would fill evenly and\nleaving clear pathways for access to the\nwell thought out cleaning areas and\nwell as slightly less frequently placed\ntoilets. There was a large shower facil-ity, with even larger queues, and on the\nopposite side an area designated for\nhanging out and cooking.\nThe fields were in better condition generally than those at Reading,\nwith good drainage, and much more\nthought had been given to the welfare\nof campers in terms of how easy it was\nto keep clean, access chill out areas and\ncooking facilities.\nIt is also worth knowing that Pukkelpop made no separation between\nguests, press or regular punters when\nit came to camping, and any fears we\nhad about being kept awake all night\nby ignominious drunk revellers were\nquashed once inside where the Europeans were all fairly civilized and well\nbehaved by far.\nAlthough we did not have photo\nclearance for Pukkelpop, we were able\nto use the media facilities and the press\narea was pretty full although seemingly\npretty lackluster.\nLike other European festivals the\nsite runs on a token system for food\nand drink and prices, although reason-able, were in no way cheap. The token\nsystem meant that service was fast but\nI didn\u2019t find the choice inspired nor\nparticularly appetizing on the whole,\nbelieve it or not British festival fare,\nespecially at Reading, has become increasingly specialized and gourmet\nover the years. That said, you would\nnot starve: watery burgers with onions,\nhot dogs, chips, Vietnamese spring\nrolls and big pitta kebabs abounded,\nbut it wasn\u2019t the home made burgers\nand hog roasts or Thai chicken curry\nchips I had been used to at Reading.\nThere was also no area of stalls like\nat Reading, although really apart form\ngeneral mementos and knickknacks I\ndoubt you are missing much but most\nof Camden\u2019s rejects and old army surplus or hippie tie dye anyway.\nThe Belgian\u2019s are obviously a moderate and subdued bunch, probably a\nlot to do with the fact that their drinking culture is founded on sociability\nand based around half pints of readily\navailable delicious beer you want to sa-vour, not a Carling in sight, and glasses of generally fine standard French\nwine. There were no bars selling spirit\ndrinks at the festival for example, and\nadmittedly this meant festival goers\n\u201cThe Smashing\nPumpkins reunite\nto headline\nalmost all\nmajor summer\nfestivals\u201d\n\u201cThe most\nincredible giant\nscalectrix track\nof moving LED\nlights\u201d\nKings of Leon\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 felix Friday 28 September 2007\nMusic Feature\nEditor \u2013 Greg Mead\n\n"

The money gained will\nbe used to pay for the next phase of\nthe Beit Masterplan which is seeing a\nnumber of redevelopments in the Union building being made.\nUnfortunately, the deal made between the two parties has stalled because the College is unhappy with the\ncurrent situation the Union\u2019s finance\nsystems. The second phase of Beit\u2019s\nredevelopment will not happen until\n2008 now. Head to the News section\nfor more information.\nCentenary Ball success\n\u201cHella mash-up\u201d was yelled louder\nthan ever before at the 2007 Summer\nBall. Tied in with the Centenary cele-brations, the Summer Ball was the Union\u2019s most successful ever and it even\nmade a profit.\nRegular tickets for the Summer Ball\nhad sold out with a month to go until\nthe event itself leaving the remaining\nEnts tickets to be snapped up. Some\ntickets even popped up on eBay.\nEvents at the Ball included the usual\nmix of sets from T4/Radio1 presenters,\nbumper cars, a human table football\ngame and a merry-go-round the Rector couldn\u2019t resist a ride on.\nSykes\u2019 Successor\nThe next Rector of Imperial College\nLondon will be Sir Roy Anderson. He\nwill take over from Sir Richard Sykes in\nthe summer of 2008 as the 14th Rector\nat Imperial.\nCurrently, Sir Roy works for the Ministry of Defence but he has long term\nassociations with the College. During\nthe 60s he studied at Imperial obtaining a first class degree in zoology.\nHe went on to gain his PhD and then\nfurther down the line to become head\nof Imperial\u2019s Biology Department.\nPresently, he is involved with Imperial as the Chair in Infectious Disease\nEpidemiology.\nSmoking ban\nOn 1st July 2007 the smoking ban came\ninto effect. College set out its policy on\nsmoking across campus. Beyond the\nrestrictions imposed by law, College is\nnot permitting smoking on major pedestrian routes such as the Sherfield\nWalkway and Dalby Court.\nMost freshers hoping to have a cigarette will have to step outside into the\nstreet as College have ruled that nearly\nall halls rooms are smoke-free loca-tions. Exceptions to the rule are single\nbedrooms in Fisher Hall, Pembridge\nGardens and Wilson House.\nWye students disgruntled at\ndegree results\nA number of final year students studying at Wye felt that they hadn\u2019t received\nthe degree results they deserved. At\nthe time of the initial uproar, it was believed that only 10% of students were\nawarded a first or 2.1 degree. This percentage was far lower than the equivalent for previous graduates.\nHowever, in September an investigation was conducted into the apparent\ndrop in degree grades after allegations\nwere made on the Live! website by the\n2007 graduates. The investigation determined that the original 10% figure\nwas incorrect and that approximately\n26% of final year students achieved a\nfirst or 2.1 degree. The results for the\n2007 graduates were in line with previous years.\nFor the full tale including a mammoth comments thread and, of course,\nFacebook, head to Live! at www.live.\ncgcu.net. Can you remember a time\nwithout Facebook? Answers to the\nusual address.\nHall prices increase\nCollege increased the cost of halls accommodation by just under 5%. This\nincrease was above the rate of inflation.\nStudents staying in halls of residence\nwill also have to fork out cash if they\nwant to wash their clothes because\nCollege has introduced coin operated\nwashing machines.\nNot surprisingly, newly built Southside houses the most expensive rooms\nwhere an en-suite single will set you\nback a cool \u00a3155.61 per week. This\nhasn\u2019t stopped Southside from being the most popular hall meaning\nthat oversubscription has led to many\nfreshers being asked to take up residence in one of the other halls.\nBrian May hands in thesis\nQueen guitarist Brian May finally\nhanded in his thesis after leaving Imperial College over 30 years ago. The rock\nlegend studied physics completing his\nundergraduate studies as well as four\nyears worth of postgraduate work.\nHowever, he left the Blackett Laboratory for the music industry. In August\nMay returned to complete the thesis he\nstarted all those years ago. Later in the\nsame month he was awarded his doc-torate. So, that\u2019s Dr Brian May to me\nand you.\nImperial students\u2019 spelling\nability questionable\nImperial genetic scientist Dr... Bernard\nLamb, published spelling mistakes\nmade by 75 different students. Also\na member of the Queen\u2019s English Society, Dr... Lamb said that he was trying to \u201cput pressure on the education\nestablishment.\u201d\nDr... Lamb said that he often had to\ncorrect students more than once on the\nsame mistake. Some common spelling\nmistakes include \u201cson\u201d instead of \u201csun\u201d\nand \u201cseamam\u201d instead of \u201csemen\u201d.\nJULY\nAUGUST\nNew Sabbaticals\nAfter a successful trip to Bath for the\nannual staff day out, the new Union\nPresident Steve Brown took over from\nJohn Collins (pictured enjoying the\namber nectar). Mr... Brown\u2019s trio of\nDeputy Presidents and the new Medics\u2019 President also move into their new\noffices.

The Royal Charter\nmarked Imperial College London leaving the University of London and becoming a university in its own right.\nA special event was held inside the\nmain entrance to Imperial College.\nThe Queen and the Rector both made\nspeeches to staff, students and alumni\nbefore the very first Imperial degrees\nwere presented to a number of important figures including the Duke of\nEdinburgh.\nHeathrow expansion\nprotestors\nClimate change protestors set up camp\non Imperial College owned land in\nHarlington, near to Heathrow airport.\nThe Camp for Climate Change protestors were campaigning against the expansion of Heathrow airport.\nImperial became involved because\nthe protestors were camped illegally\non land owned by College. The site in\nHarlington is home to a sports ground\nand a number of pitches used by Imperial students.

There are books\nabout spies, there are books about men\npunching other men, and then there\nare Jane Austen novels. When they\u2019re\nsplit off for their sex education in primary school, boys don\u2019t watch videos\nabout puberty \u2013 they get taught that\nTom Hanks is the devil incarnate, that\nwearing socks with sandals is a divine\nright, and that Jane Austen is for girls.\nHere\u2019s why, and for the gentlemen\nreading, please stop me when you start\nto feel the urge to crochet. Jane Austen\u2019s\nundeniably famous work, Pride and\nPrejudice, is set in Hertfordshire and\nchronicles the lives of the Bennett family \u2013 the frumpy, class-obsessed Mrs.\nBennett, the dry but otherwise uncaring Mr. Bennett, and their five daughters \u2013 and those that they know, both\nlocally and further afield. Beginning\nwith one of the most famous lines in\nEnglish literature, which I brutally tore\nup in the opening of this article, the arrival of a wealthy, single young man to\nthe neighbourhood starts off a chain of\nevents that leads to scandal, heaving\nbosoms and mostly happy endings.\nWith books like Austen\u2019s, what\u2019s often hardest is to get around the age\nof the piece. This sort of literature\nwas considered entertaining a couple\nof centuries ago \u2013 but so were public\nexecutions, and they\u2019ve fallen way out\nof style lately. Just because Austen understood the idea of a Novel well for\nher time, does that mean she deserves\nany credit on bookstore shelves these\ndays?\nWell it turns out that, mostly, she\ndoes. Pride and Prejudice isn\u2019t a perfect read of course, at least not for\nsomeone raised, as I was, on Douglas\nAdams and that chap that wrote The\nHardy Boys series. Austen likes to describe events and then make you read\nvery long letters written about the\nsame events, and even for a romance\nnovel, conspicuously little happens\nbesides elopements and marriage pro-posals. But you\u2019re reading Austen, after\nall, and so the trick is not to expect a\nplot to murder the President, or an off-the-wall parody of current events, but\ninstead to accept what she was trying\nto do and really let yourself go in it.\nIf you can manage this, Pride and\nPrejudice opens up completely. Some\nof the characters can feel a little generic \u2013 although that\u2019s possibly because\nit\u2019s such a real portrait of the time, and\nso the fact that the men are almost\nidentical save their taste in women is\nwell-deserved \u2013 but most of them,\nElizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy in\nparticular, are well-rounded and enjoy-able. Austen\u2019s also incredibly quotable\nfor the most part, and her narrative has\na lot of subtle digs at the differences between the sexes. The play between the\nfive Bennett sisters creates some really\nbrilliant situations, and Austen clearly\nenjoys painting pictures of the different meanings of womanhood.\nAnd so, yes. I ended up reading a\nbook about heaving bosoms, and womanhood and things. There\u2019s a slightly\ndead patch where the plot seems to just\ngive in on itself from the sheer weight\nof uneventful pages, but other than\nthat things really do seem to move. Despite the fact I\u2019ve had no dreams since\nof being proposed to by a tall, dark\nEnglishman, there is a sense of excitement about the plans and schemes of\nthe characters and how strong a force\nthe social expectations exerted over\npeople who succumbed to them.\nIt\u2019s not, in the main, an exciting book.\nI feel honour bound to point this out to\nanyone hoping for a no-holds-barred\nkiss-fest set in steamy Hertfordshire.\nBut she does make something of it;\nshe\u2019s able to show you why people read\nRomance novels, and how people write\nthem. You can only use a cookie cutter to produce things before it starts\nto look a bit worn, but despite being\nresponsible for almost every film Colin Firth has ever been in, Pride and\nPrejudice works hard for a place on the\nclassics shelf. If you can bear with the\nconstant bantering, balls and Britishness, you\u2019ll find a really good read.\nFive women walk into a bar, and the tallest goes up and orders an innuendo.

And welcome to\nImperial College if\nyou\u2019re a new fresher,\nand congratulations on\nnot failing all your exams if you\u2019re a returning student. My\nmany regular readers will know that\nthis page is the place to come if you\u2019re\ninterested in a great night out, so I suggest you cast an eye over them, if you\u2019re\nnew, I\u2019ll introduce myself. I\u2019m Greg,\nyour friendly nightlife editor. I make\nthese beautiful pages you are stroking\nwith your eyes, if you cast your eyes\nupwards, that\u2019s a photo of me. Regular readers will notice it\u2019s not my usual\npicture so feel free to cut it out to add\nto your collection/pin board/wallet.\nNow, those who are new to London\nI suggest you don\u2019t go straight out and\ntake a load of drugs and rave for the\nnext six weeks. I\u2019m going to take a Uturn on my usual jaded opinion of the\nUnion and suggest that you check out\nas many freshers events as you can.\nEven if you think they are a bit cheesy\nfor your tastes, they are a really great\nway of making new friends, and are\nmuch more suitable for chatting about\nwhat A levels you took, what school\nyou went to and why you didn\u2019t choose\nOxbridge than a pumping 3000 capacity club miles away from College.\nAnyway, enough with the patronis-ing. Once you\u2019ve settled in, made some\nfriends you\u2019ll be ready to go out and\nsample the delights of London, and\nthere are lots. Read our wonderful article to the right for some starting points,\nand check out our regular page for re-views, interviews and previews on all\nthings nightlife. You could always enter\nour regular competitions for a chance\nto win a free night out!\nNow all I need to say, is enjoy fresh-ers week and good luck for this year.\nReach for the lasers, it\u2019s time to rave. Make the most of it before you die from your extreme workload\nWelcome to London, newbies\nSince you may have just joined IC, and\nnot be from London, or even from\nthe UK, then we\u2019ve been kind enough\nto write a little list of club nights we\nmight visit throughout the week, either because they are good or cheap.\nEither way, I suggest that if you don\u2019t\nlike Indie or Electro then destroy this\narticle now.\nMonday\nIt\u2019s the start of the week, so what better day to start your week of excess, we\nsuggest DURRR at The End, run by the\nlovely ex Trash DJs (Where Erol Alkan\nmade his name) Here, you\u2019ll hear a delightful mix of post-punk, old (real) indie and pumping hard electro. You will\nbe swiftly removed from the queue unless your clothes and musical taste are\nup to standard (fashion show Indie).\nTuesday\nIgnore that hangover from last night,\nand make your way over to The Roxy\non Rathbone Place for Panic! a perfect\nstudent type Indie/Electro night sure\nto please all but the most snobbish of\nyou with \u00a31.50 drinks all night.\nWednesday\nVenture over to Notting Hill for Death\nDisco, with Dan McGee at the Notting\nHill Arts Club, get there before 8pm\nand you\u2019ll get in for free, which coincides with the start of happy hour. Expect to hear an eclectic mix of Indie,\nPost-Punk, and a bit of Electro. They\nalso have live bands.\nThursday\nGet over to Candybox at Moonlighting, if you fancy a horrible night of Indie cheese. The questionable choice of\nmusic is balanced by the \u00a31.00 house\nspirit and mixers, so turn up with \u00a320\nand leave totally wasted.\nFriday\nYou absolutely must go to And Did We\nMention Our Disco (See article below)\nat Hub Club in East London, simply\nthe coolest electro/disco party in town,\nthey regular host nights with the likes\nof Justice, 2ManyDJs, Headman, Erol\nAlkan and many many more. Hub club\nis a London Met student bar, so the\ndrinks are very cheap too. Get there\nearly.\nSaturday\nAfterskool, the best student Indie\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve moved into what is arguably the best city in the universe for\nclubbing, music and general nocturnal activities, so here are some suggestions\nclub night in London, hosted at LSE\u2019s\nstudent union is a great option, the\nDJ\u2019s are good and the drinks are quite\ncheap. Other options include irregular\nclub nights at The Barfly (live bands)\nand maybe something good at the Union, if you\u2019re very very lucky.\nSunday\nSleep, or do some work (hah!).\nIf these suggestions don\u2019t tickle your\nfancy, then have a look at our wonderful list of competition prizes we\u2019ve\ngot to giveaway on the next page, they\ncould give you some inspiration.\nWe suggest though, that you go out\nand explore this wonderful town, who\nknows, you may discover something\nGregory Mead\nthat nobody else knows, such as the\nmost awesome club in the world. Grab\nsome flyers on a night out, that\u2019ll give\nyou some ideas. Around Old Street,\nin East London is a great place to find\nup and coming events, it\u2019s packed full\nof cool cafes and bars with millions of\nflyers on display, they play good music\nand are a great place to hang out before\nheading off for a heavy night out on the\ntown.\nIf you\u2019re into extreme raving till your\nbrain explodes of lack of water/over-heating/other, then warehouse parties\nare probably your thing, look out in Felix for previews of the our favourites,\nthey are a great night out, and usually\nallow you to bring your own drinks!\nNow go forth, and party.\nOur Disco is back. Again!\nOur Disco is back! No, we don\u2019t mean\nOur Disco, we mean And Did We\nMention Our Disco, also briefly known\nas And We Didn\u2019t Mention Our Disco.\nConfused? Good, now pay attention.\nThis was literally the best club night\nin the entire world (along with Bugged\nOut) before it was savagely kicked out\nof it\u2019s long standing home at Plastic\nPeople.\nIt made a few awesome appearances\nat Canvas and it has now settled into a\nnew home at Hub Club in East London,\nboasting an awesome sound system, ultra cheap booze and a constantly great\nlineup, you couldn\u2019t ask for anything\nmore on a Friday night.\nRegular readers of Felix Nightlife are\nprobably getting bored of us going on\nabout this place, but we don\u2019t care because we\u2019re the editors and we decide\nwhat goes in, not you!\nMake sure you get there early for a\nbig name night, it always sells out fast.\nCheck out www.ourdisco.com for further information and lineups.\nNightlife needs you!\nFelix Nightlife needs new writers and\nan assistant editor!\nIf you want free entry to clubs and\nevents in London, and are capable\nof stringing a few words together in\nEnglish, then you can be a reviewer\nor editor!

Some new sections have also been introduced this\nyear, there will be a Mr. Muscle section\nwhich will give tips on how to upgrade\nyourself and get in shape. A new sports\nleague has also been introduced and\nwork is under way to get a prize sorted\nfor the winning team at the end of the\nseason.

Fi not having\na clue and a last minute nature were\ngoing to be themes of our tour. We\nwere scheduled to play four teams\nover 10 days during our tour of Cyprus: First stop was Agia Napa.\nOur adjustment to the heat was\nswift as we hit the beach on the first\nnight, all wearing our beautiful lime\ngreen t-shirts, there was no way we\nwere going to lose each other. The\nContinued on page 42\nIC better than medics, fact!\nThe dreaded bleep test being carried out in the sports hall\nImperial College Union has been ranker above Imperial Medicals in a recent\nleague table of all the sporting institutions in the United Kingdom. Imperial\nwere ranked 29th in the country whilst\nthe medics could only manage 104th,\nranked between Central London and\nWinchester. The ranking was determined by the British University Sports\nAssociation (BUSA) in their annual\noverall championship points, in which\nLoughborough came top with 5015.5\npoints, followed by Bath and Birmingham with 3505.5 and 2601 points\nrespectively.\nImperial can not however claim to\nbe the best sporting institution in London, as that crown belongs to Brunel\nWest London who came 23rd with 926\npoints, compared to Imperials 735.5\npoints.\nWith the ever increasing support\nfrom Sport Imperial, and the high levels of enthusiasm from the ACC and\nICSM SU, Imperial can expect to climb\nthe league table in years to come.\nFor those medics that are finding\nthis hard to believe, visit the BUSA\nwebsite: www.busa.org.uk\nAfter on going talks between the Athletics Club Committee (ACC) and\nSport Imperial over the summer break,\na pre-season training schedule was\nagreed upon for the sports teams from\nthe ACC from the 24th \u2013 28th September, to be held at Ethos as well as Hyde\nPark.\nThe event was a massive success with\nnearly 70 players attending the week\nlong event, and it will hopefully put\nthem and their teams in good stead for\nthe forthcoming season. From noon,\nevery day, the teams would have a 2\nhour conditioning session with the\nSport Imperial staff, after which the\nteams were given free time for personal training and sport massages. Several\nsocial events were organised as well,\nincluding a dodgeball tournament on\nthe Friday for all the individuals that\nattended.\nWith only 80 places available each\nday, due to capacity constraints in\nthe sports hall and availability, it was\nconsidered to be a hit for those that at-tended. However, it was disappointing\nto see that there were certain clubs that\ndidn\u2019t sign up at all, and that there was\nnot a consistent turnout from those\nthat did. Those who attended seemed\nto think that the week was a great idea\nand that they would like it to be repeated next year.\nEthos staff organised and ran the sessions and facilitated the demands from\nthe ACC for the pre-season week. The\nfact that Sport Imperial were willing to\nencourage sporting ability within the\ncollege, and were more than happy to\nhelp, is a testament to them. Although\nas always, there would be a financial\nimplication to the clubs to take part.\nThe majority of the costs were covered by the clubs and their members,\nwith the ACC contributing a disclosed\namount and Sport Imperial covering\nthe small remainder from their Developing Excellence Scheme.\nHopefully next year Sport Imperial\nand the ACC will be able to organise\nanother pre-season training, and that\nthere will be a greater uptake from the\nsports teams themselves. As always the\nquestion that should be raised is why\nsports clubs have to pay their own university to use their facilities, especially\nwhen the college is trying to improve\nthe standard of sport?\n\n"

After dusting snow off our\nbags we stepped up the pace and\nstomped it down, making record\ntime to reach the planned night\u2019s\nrefuge in Montroc, where the\nothers caught up with us.\nSadly Day 12 offered more bad\nweather, and so the ridge walk was\nabandoned in favour of a\nvalley walk to Chamonix\nand a cable car upwards.\nThe gondola and cable\ncar combo ascended us\ninto cloud to Le Br\u00e9vent\nat 2525m. Fresh snow was\nfalling and five inches lay\non the ground; the group\nphotograph looks more\nlike a winter tour! After snowball fights we\ngingerly picked our\nway to the Refuge\nBellachat (2150m).\nThe view from it was\nmagical with the clearing cloud.\nThe final day began encountering an ibex at close quarters on\nthe trail. It was an incredible sight\nto see such a large wild mammal\nfearless of us. On continuing, we\ndescended into lower-lying cloud\nand the group briefly split, re-meeting further down to all stroll\ntogether to the campsite we\u2019d left\n13 days before. Now it was time\nto celebrate! After some beers we\nate like kings in a local restaurant.\nOver dinner it transpired that\nChris, the black spot game\u2019s insti-gator, was the one with the spot\nleft in his bag. His forfeit was our\nentertainment: a streak through\nthe village in Anna\u2019s hot pants\nand bikini whilst chanting pro-environmental slogans.\nCompleting such a circular\nroute evoked a mixture of emotions \u2013 elation of completion\nthat the entire snow and glacier-covered massif has been circum-navigated, but also that after such\nPeuty, and sold\nout to \u20ac10 dry\nbeds. There was\none remedy for\nour cold and\ndamp state: we\nate custard!\nRain, high winds,\nsnow on the passes and\nlow cloud tempted\nus to seek\nalternative transport for day 11.\nWe decided\nto walk,\nbut some\nturned\nback and\ntook trans-port. Oncethe\nremaining seven of\nus got into our stride the\nrain turned to snow and then\nto hail. We made it to the refuge at the Col de Balme (2191m)\n(Franco-Swiss border) and quickly scrambled inside; it was warm,\ncosy and smelled of tasty vegetable soup. Unfortunately all\ngood things come to\nan end and we\na long trip we were still in the\nsame place!\nOver the fortnight we\u2019d\ncrossed ten mountain passes,\nfour of those standing at over\n2500m, covered 164km of\ntough terrain, accumulated a\nheight gain of around 8,800m\nand loss of 10,250m, and all\ncarrying not inconsiderable\nrucksacks \u2013 some over 20kg.\nWe encountered weather extremes of 30\u00b0C sunshine and\nblizzards to deal with, as well\nas significant snow fields to\ncross. Several high-level balcony paths provided feelings of\nbeing on top of the world, and\nfor me, although it is difficult\nto choose, the high level variant route we took on Day 6 was\na real highlight \u2013 spending the\nentire day above 2000m, and\nenjoying panoramic views on\ntop of two summits.\nMemories such as this one\n(and all the rest) will last a\nlifetime.\nPhotographs taken by: Wilfred Yung and Charlie Rogers\nDesigned by Alice Rowlands\n\n"

    "content": "Beware The Jabberwock, My Son\nR\neprogramming \u2013 alright,\nhacking \u2013 is something of\na joy for me in Bioshock.\nIt\u2019s simple why \u2013 no matter what flavour of hell is\nbreaking loose around me, hacking\nbrings everything to a standstill, and\npropels the players into something\nreminiscent of the Amiga classic PipeMania. You move some tiles around,\nthe flow of electricity is rerouted\naround the machine, and the puzzle\ngets solved. Deep breaths. You\u2019re back\nin the room.\nSo I leave from hacking my latest\nconquest beaming, the soft green light\nand gentle whirring being roughly as\nclose as I can get to an actual friend\nout here in the godforsaken medical\nasylumn I\u2019m wading through. I notice\nsome bandages lying on the floor, and\nmy health\u2019s a little low. Instinctively,\nI\u2019m down on the ground scratching\nfor them. But there\u2019s a second packet\njust on from that \u2013 maybe someone\ndropped it. Or... dropped it.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s all useful \u2013 I\u2019m\npciking it up as I see the third packet.\nSomewhere in the space between the\nmonitor and my left hand, I remember\nevery episode of Tom and Jerry I ever\nwatched. But by the time I remember\nwhat happens to the hapless cat, the\ndoor slams behind me, and there\u2019s a\nburst of frothy, white steam. Everything goes pale, I\u2019m blind, and on both\nsides of the game something screams.\nI don\u2019t play a lot of \u2018scary\u2019 games. I\nplayed the FEAR demo and enjoyed\nthe atmosphere enough, but Half-Life\n2\u2019s Ravenholm section was mostly\ncharged through, shouting loudly,\nand the less said about my progress\nthrough Doom III, the better. That\u2019s\npartly because I like to think, and I\nlike to shoot, and the aforementioned\nscreaming tends to distract me from\nthese things. But it\u2019s also because horror has become manufactured in a lot\nof \u2018scary\u2019 games. Ravenholm was a city\nof zombies. That was about as clever\nas the fear got. And Doom\u2019s ingenuity\nstops short of the main menu screen.\nBioshock\u2019s slickness of presentation,\nand brightness of concept, drew me to\npurchase it. But in truth, I knew nothing about the game. It\u2019s setting sounded dark enough, but I was completely\nunprepared for how much it tried to\nscare the player. Somewhere between\nthe brutal murders and drug abuse,\nI realised this wasn\u2019t going to be all\nsunshine and frolicking. It was going\nto be the other thing. Tortured botox\npatients and demonic little girls with\nhypodermic needles.\nBut Bioshock\u2019s horror is different. It\u2019s\nmore natural. It\u2019s more subtle. After\nthe steam clears, only two things have\nchanged in the room \u2013 which turns out\nto be a dentist\u2019s office \u2013 that I notice\nfrom before. The first is that a small\nred box has been placed on a desk. It\u2019s\na diary entry, and it\u2019s next to the genetic power-up I came for. The diary entries \u2013 a trademark of Ken Levine, who\nMichael Cook goes in search of shadows, splicers and scares in Bioshock \u2013 and likes what he finds\ndesigned both Thief and System Shock\n2 \u2013 are left by many of Bioshock\u2019s in-habitants. My favourite \u2013 Tenenbaum\n\u2013 records her discovery of the technology that now powers both mine\nand others\u2019 amazing \u2018gift\u2019. Other diary\nentries show you the slow degradation\nof life in the underwater metropolis of\nRapture. Some chart the destruction\nof lives. Failed experiments, broken\ndreams and occasional flashes of gory\nfates. They keep you alert, make sure\nyou\u2019re never fully settled. The white\nnoise of terror. The background hum\nof pant-wetting. Even when I\u2019m hack-ing, they\u2019re still playing on.\nThe second item that\u2019s appeared in\nthe room is a corpse on the dentist\u2019s\nchair. It\u2019s charred, bloody, and looking\na little depressed. Instinctively, I set it\nalight, leaping around and shouting.\nBut whoever it was, they weren\u2019t in a\nposition to complain. And being burnt\nalive was probably a preferable fate to\nthe death they received anyhow.\nI rush over and play the recording.\nSome doctor is discussing the ethics of\nhis work \u2013 something of a thorny dis-cussion, and I later find \u201cFirst, do no\nharm\u201d written in blood on the floor.\nJust as he gets around to talking about\nart, or flesh, or something, there\u2019s a\nhiss of gas and suddenly I\u2019m sucking\nwhite again.\nBut this time, nothing happens. So\nwhen the mist clears, I pick up the\nPlasmid cannister \u2013 a powerup for\nmy crazed abilities \u2013 and turn around,\nflexing my muscles and fingering the\ntrigger to my shotgun. As it turned out,\nI chose the right weapon.\nThe key is the setting. We\u2019re in a city.\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s an underwater city\npopulated by crazed, pipe-wielding\npsychopaths, genetic freaks and Irishmen. And its moral code read likes\nBeezlebub\u2019s own suggestion box. But\nit\u2019s still a working city, with real people that have desires and needs, mostly\nrevolving around getting out or surviv-ing. You\u2019re all trapped in Rapture \u2013 the\nwill to survive grips the player just as\ntightly as any of the AI, and so the fear\nyou have of the shadows is twinned\nwith your own exploitation of them.\nThe horror of gene harvesting is mirrored by your own quest for the fuel\nthat powers you.\nIt\u2019s clever, and it\u2019s exciting \u2013 the\nfear is a two-way construct. For the\nfirst time I can remember, I\u2019m not being put onto a fairground ghost ride.\nI\u2019m not being told there\u2019s scary things\nahead. My level of control over the\nsituation determines the balance of the\nfear. Sometimes it\u2019s in my favour. As I\nspin around to come face to face with a\nscalpel-wielding surgeon three inches\nfrom my face, I realise that now is not\none of those times. The trigger snaps\nclose, and the crazed knife jockey gives\nthe room a much needed splash of col-our. I try to think of a quip, but nothing\ncomes \u2013 no-one\u2019s going to hear it but\nthe turrets anyway.\nI have high hopes for the future of\nHorror in videogames, and Bioshock is\none of the reasons for it. It doesn\u2019t need\nto jump out at you, but it will. It will\ndo a lot of things, if they\u2019re necessary\nto scare the crap out you. But these\nthings are always \u2013 always \u2013 secondary to what the player wants to do. He\nwants to play. The game builds itself\naround me, and that\u2019s the way it should\nbe. Long after the Orange Box is re-leased, soon now, we\u2019ll get a chance to\nplay Valve\u2019s Left 4 Dead, a co-op \u2018Zombie Sim\u2019 with a director that tweaks the\nlevel to keep the players on their toes.\nThat\u2019s the source of truly terrifying\ngaming. Not from forcing the player\nto crawl along the floor, whacking on\nsome violins, and setting off a jack-in-the-box in their face. But from giving\nthe player free rein, and having them\nknow that, however they play, the\ngame will come. And the game will\nfind a way to frighten.\nNow there\u2019s a scary thought.\nNew look centrefolds for 2007! Steampunk! Divers! Thinly-veiled Freudian-esque paedophilia! Ban this sick filth now at onlyajoke.felix@ic.ac.uk\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nFriday 28 September 2007 felix\nGames\n\n"

And\nthat means that however pissed off,\nheartbroken, broke or just generally\npissed off you feel it wont be long before you have drowned your sorrows\nin some cheap vodka Red Bull and are\nready to get over to the dance floor and\nthrow some crazy shapes.\nBe careful on entering to tell the girl\nat the box office which night you have\ncome for as the Academy also hosts a\ncheesy Essex girls and hen party filled\nnight called Le Grande Fromage, and\nto be honest, if you felt your life was in\nthe gutter you\u2019d be wishing it was over\nif you chanced to find yourself in that\nroom.\nFeeling Gloomy is anything but a\ndour night out and I have to say, in a\nmodern world where more and more\nfrighteningly I leave indie establishments on their regular indie nights\nthinking I may just have left a twilight\nzone version of Top of The Pops, the\nsound track is genuinely indie alternative and full of people who genuinely\nlove indie alternative and rock and roll.\nNot to say there isn\u2019t a decent smattering of the greatest hits of new rave\nand electro, but they are kept in their\nplace by DJ\u2019s Leanord and Cliff who really know how to get the audience to\nparty and enjoy themselves. This place\nhas no shame, because as Beth Ditto\nrecently told a London crowd at The\nForum, there is no shame in having a\ngood time tonight.\nSo you won\u2019t find girls and guys that\nare all hair, bright tights, tight jeans and\nbig shoes standing around and looking\ncool, but you will find the coolest motley crew of music lovers letting their\nhair down to forget their troubles and\nreally move to their favourite tunes. I\nwent with my sister to the club night\u2019s\n2nd birthday and there was cake and\nnibbles, a fun loving crowd, an air guitar band \u2018The Miserablists\u2019 and free\nT-shirts for everyone at the end of the\nnight. We danced and we laughed and\nwe did air guitar, chatted to some nice\npeople, some drunk people, some very\nrandom people and danced with whoever was shakin\u2019 their thing our way. It\nwas probably the most fun I have had\nin ages and the least self-conscious or\noverly self aware place, great for people\nlike me who rarely get up and dance so\nreadily.\nThe Bar Academy, where the night\nlends itself really well to the vibe, being\nsmall enough to get to know people\u2019s\nfaces over the night and get from the\ndance floor to smoking area round the\nback without too much strife. Not too\nhot and not too long a wait at the bar\nand the toilets were clean enough. And\nnot a bad price at \u00a35 entry for students\non the door and \u00a33.50 in advance\nonline.\nPlus, on most nights they have \u2018Speed\nHating\u2019 where you can rant for three\nminutes to someone you have just met\nin return for listening to their rants af-terwards. Perfect.\nIf you are looking for a place to kick\nloose, jump around to The Smiths and\nPulp, scream along to Total Eclipse of\nThe Heart and the like, then this really\nis for you.\nIf these days it seems we are all meant\nto feel grateful rave has been so colour-fullyrevivedandeverybodyaroundyou\nseems to be underage or to have fallen\nout of a box of Hoxton lookalikes, then\nsalvation is close at hand .\nSaturdays at the Academy we thank\nGod for Rock and Roll and reasons to\nfeel less gloomy .\nCompetitions galore\nOh my freaking God look at the\nprizes we\u2019ve got for you this week!\nYou\u2019d better enter, I had to do unspeakable things to get hold of\nthese.\nSimply email us saying which prize\nyou would like, and why!\nnightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFabric Week!\nTwo double passes over 3 nights for a special Fabric week in October. You\u2019ll see LCD\nSoundsystem playing a special DJ set on\nThursday October 25, True Playaz night on\nthe Friday (26th), and then the usual Fabric\nstylings on the Saturday the 27th. See\nwww.fabriclondon.com for more info.\nAlbum Launch at The End\nOne double pass for the Layo & Bushwacka!\nalbum launch and the Will Saul Simple\nSounds mix launch, both on Saturday 6th\nOctober, PLUS a copy of each album!

Listen to\nclub and funky house all night long.\nEgg Club\nAlbum launches galore\nThe End goes mad and hosts two album launches at once. Layo\n& Bushwacka! and Will Saul take over next Saturday\nChanges are afoot at Olmeto. Layo\n& Bushwacka!\u2019s superb monthly party\nis The End\u2019s flagship Saturday night,\nand throughout 2007, Olmeto has set\naside AKA for the sumptuous sounds\nof Will Saul and his label Simple\nRecords. However, from September\nonwards, they mix things up with Will\nand guests taking care of The End\u2019s\nlounge, whilst Layo & Bushwacka!\ncontinue to flex their muscles in the\nmain room. Into AKA goes Freerange,\na label much loved by both the Olmeto\nand Simple chiefs. Freerange head\nhoncho Jimpster will be bringing his\nlabel\u2019s deep and melodic sounds, plus\nspecially selected guests, to AKA each\nand every month.\nAfter a month bedding into the\nnew format, October\u2019s Olmeto takes\non special significance with the night\nacting as a vehicle to launch not one,\nbut two major albums. First up in the\nmain room, Layo & Bushwacka! will be\nmarking the release of their first mix\nalbum in nearly four years. Global\nUnderground \u2013 champions of the mix\nalbum format with a back catalogue\nthat reads like a DJ Allstars list \u2013 have\nbestowed the honour of mixing the latest instalment, \u2018Global Underound Rio\u2019,\nupon the pair. As with all GU albums,\nit\u2019s a two-disc affair, and as with their\nlast mix album \u2018All Night Long\u2019, the\nboys wanted to represent both the old\nand the new. CD1 represents the finest\nmusic of the past 20 years with many\npersonal favourites from the likes of Ellis D, Francois K and Lil\u2019 Louis, whilst\nCD2 covers the very best of their current sets, taking in tracks from cutting\nedge talent such as Phonique, Tiga, Guy\nGerber and Henrik Schwartz. Joining\nLayo & Bushwacka! in the main room\nis one of Germany\u2019s most exciting new\ntalents, Daso, who will be performing\none of his wild live shows.\nWhat do you do when you fall in love?

    "content": "14 felix Friday 28 September 2007\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nFacebook meets the social worker\nCitizenship and Chatroom hit the National Theatre \u2013 Caz Knight was there to give the verdict on both\nC\nhatroom/Citizenship,\nwritten by Enda Walsh\nand Mark Ravenhill re-spectively, are two short\nplays exploring a variety of teenage issues. Performed at the\nNational Theatre on London\u2019s South\nBank, the theatre shows over 18 plays\nper year ranging from classics to new\nplays.\nWith a view to understanding teen\nculture Walsh gives us Chatroom: six\nmid-teens in cyberspace, \u201cmiddle class,\nof varying wealth, in and around Chiswick\u201d. What starts off as a snappy, wit-ty, laugh-a-minute exchange of ideas\nbetween members of the chatroom on\nteen culture turns into a depraved view\nat the sourest side of adolescence. That\ndoes not detract in any way from the\nprofoundness and the issues explored\nand the messages which the play seeks\nto portray.\nThe play opens with a musical extract of the \u2018Oompa-Lumpa\u2019 song from\nthe much loved Willy Wonka and the\nChocolate Factory (1971) and a heated,\nbut highly amusing, discussion about\nsaid film ensues, as well as banter concerning \u201cHarry fucking Potter\u201d and\nBritney Spears. The opening may lead\nus to believe we were in for an evening\nof no more than a few laughs at the\nyouth of today.\nIntroduce Jim, suicidal, troubled and\ndepressed following the flight of his\nfather 10 years earlier. The other teenagers quickly discover the cause they\nhave been looking for: to be there for\nJim. The sordidness quickly escalates\nuntil the play deals with manipulation and even the possibility of public\nsuicide.\nNot only exploring some major issues which a lot of the (predominantly\nteenage) audience may be battling in\ntheir own heads such as bullying and\nteen angst, the play offers viewpoint\non other ideas such as the media itself\nbeing a tool of manipulation, the safety\nand authenticity of the internet and\nreligion.\nPraise must be given for the truly\nspectacular performance of Jim, carried out by Steven Webb. Webb portrays the nervy, quirky, misfit with a\n\u2018thing\u2019 for penguins and cowboys flawlessly and with hilarity. He is so convincing that one finds oneself endeared\nto him and his eccentric mannerisms.\nGeorge Rainsford, playing the part of\nWilliam, gives a comical if not slightly\nboisterous performance but keeps the\naudience laughing with his alternate\nending for Willy Wonka; \u201cthey make\nshit out of him\u201d. All the actors showed\ntalent and conviction in their roles\nright up until the closing scene, probably one of the most emotive and happy\nendings I have experienced in a stage\nproduction which resumes the initial\nmood of the play.\nC\nitizenship, also a foray\ninto the lives of contemporary teenagers, follows\n16-year-old Tom and his\nquest to find his feet with\nregards to his sexuality. The opening\nscene of Tom having his ear pierced by\nAmy (after, of course, the mandatory\nfour neurofen and vodka that precedes\nany do-it-yourself ear piercing) immediately reflects the setting of the play,\nwhich contrasts heavily to the middle-class backdrop of Chatroom. The play\nis set in a rather \u201cghetto\u201d London comprehensive and one instantly recognises the according uniform of tracksuit\nbottoms, caps and baggy t-shirts.\nTom is highly confused about his\nsexual orientation. This confusion is\nbrought about by a recurring dream\nin which he is unaware of the gender of the person he is kissing. Tom\nseeks advice in differing ways from his\nhighly strung and stressed out Citizenship teacher, the internet, a Tarot card\nreader, his friend Amy and finally an\nattached gay man who he met online.\nThese set of events lead Tom (and the\naudience)tocontinuallyswingbetween\nthinking he is straight and thinking he\nis gay. In a moment of confusion he\nand Amy sleep together which leads to\nthe inevitable pregnancy of Amy and\nintroduces the theme of parenthood\n(highly reminiscent of the recently\nreleased Knocked Up). A whole host\nof different issues are explored in the\nplay which, as in Chatroom, are highly\nrelevant to both teenagers and adults\nalike. The title \u2018Citizenship\u2019 refers to\nthe GCSE subject Tom is studying,\nthe title of which (\u201cWhat a multicultural society means to me\u201d) could not\nbe more apt in British society today.\nDrug use, teachers, peer pressure and\nschool are all topics which everyone\nhas had to contemplate and ensures a\nfervent interest is kept in the play. The\ndirector (Anna Mackmin) pays attention to small details which teenagers\nwould identify with such as Britney\nSpears and Amy Winehouse ringtones,\nmyspace and two school children doing \u2018blow-back\u2019 with a spliff.\nCitizenship saw acting talent of high\ncalibre once more. Richard Dempsey carried out the role of \u201cSir\u201d, Tom\u2019s\nyoung teacher who is constantly on\nedge. Dempsey is extremely competent at portraying these qualities and\nis successful in breaking the stereotypical view of teachers so common\nin all types of media. Here, he is seen\nas a real person with all kinds of their\nown demons. Michelle Tate, as Amy,\nearned a lot of laughs with her aggressiveness paired with her \u201ctherapy\u201d bab-ble. However, she does not quite pull\noff the \u201csarf\u201d London accent, occasionally slipping into Aussie. George Rainsborough showed variety in his acting\nskills this time giving a side-splitting\nperformance as Gay Gary (highly\nironic), a stoner with an identity crisis.\nSome of the characters seemed to be\nslightly caricature but this only served\nto reinforce the light-heartedness and\ncomedy. Slapstick humour, sexual innuendoes and crude gestures aplenty,\nthis appealed to the younger viewers\nand indeed any of us with an immature\nside.\nWith a personal preference for the\nunceasing, upbeat comedy in Citizenship, both the plays have the audience\nenthralled from the beginning until\nthe final applause. For the philistines\nout there who find the idea of the theatre daunting or boring, Chatroom/\nCitizenship is an ideal transition into\nthe wonderful world of the stage and\nguarantees a great time too. Currently\non your, if you miss it at the National\ndo try and catch it when it is showing\nat any of the other cities within striking distance of London (Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton amongst others). For\ntour dates visit: www.nationaltheatre.\norg.uk\nThe lighting and character arrangement is central to Chatroom\u2019s conveyance of the e-generation vibe. It deals with the rather abstract setting cleverly and powerfully\n\n"

Here\u2019s a rundown of the main news from over the summer\nFelix printing halted\nFelix was stopped in its tracks last term\nwhen the Honorary Senior Treasurer,\nDr.. Sunny Bains, refused to allow any\nmore cheques to be signed.\nFelix printing costs are largely paid\nfor using money generated from ad-vertising, however, invoicing and payment for adverts takes place after an issue has been published. Consequently,\nFelix often operates with a deficit until\nadvertising revenue comes through.\nThe last issue of Felix was printed on\n11 May 2007.\nFelix returns\n3,200 copies of the Freshers\u2019 Special Issue of Felix were published last Friday.\nThe issue was put into freshers\u2019 welcome packs ready for them to read\nupon arriving in halls. Cradled in your\nhands now is the first \u201cproper\u201d issue of\nyear. If you\u2019re not fortunate to own a\ncopy of the Freshers\u2019 Special Issue, you\ncan head to felixonline.co.uk where\nyou\u2019ll find a selection of the articles.\nAside from the new colour scheme\nand lots of cats at the tops of pages,\nFelix has a few new sections including\nphotography, How To.../How Not To...\nand Challenge The Sabbs along with\nsome old favourites. Watch this space.\nDefamatory Policy passed\nCollege took steps to protect itself\nfrom libelous or slanderous forms of\nstudent media. Council voted to pass\nthe policy and as a result College now\nhas the power to impound anything\nthat it deems defamatory, even if the\nauthor or editor disputes the claims.\nDefamatory material is helpfully defined as: \u201cthe publication of a statement\nthat which tends to lower a person in\nthe estimation of right-thinking members of society generally.\u201d That should\nmake crystal clear what you can/can\u2019t\nrant about in the Comments section.\nGSA Election farce\nThe summer saw a long and protracted election which sought to appoint\nthe new GSA Chair amongst other\npositions.\n10 people voted in the initial election\nand due to this abysmal turnout it was\ndecided to rerun the election later in\nthe summer.\nTrustee Board takes shape\nAs part of a large and ongoing Union\ngovernance restructuring, the Trustee Board Chair was appointed. Ram\nGidoomal has taken up the position.\nAt the moment, the committee is an\nInterim Trustee Board whilst the rest\nof the board members are appointed\nbefore it matures into a full flavoured\nTrustee Board.\nThe Trustee Board was set up to be\nthe sovereign and governing body of\nImperial College Union. In short, the\nTrustee Board functions to ensure\nthat the rest of the Union is running\nsmoothly and successfully.\nBefore the formation of the Trustee\nBoard, Council was the highest point\nof authority within the Union. This remains intact, along with the multitude\nof other committees but instead they\nare superseded by the almighty power\nof the Trustee Board. There is at least\none meeting each term and anyone is\nwelcome to attend. So come along!\nLinstead closes its doors\nLinstead Hall\u2019s doors closed to students\nfor the final time in June before its\ndemolition which began the following\nmonth. At a small press gathering in\nJuly, the Rector took a sledgehammer\nto the entrance doors signifying the\nend of Linstead Hall and the beginning\nof the construction of Eastside which is\ndue for completion in 2009.\nUnion awning\nIn light of the recent smoking ban,\nthe Union has decided to construct\nan awning in Beit Quad. The awning\n(shown mid-construction) will provide\na sheltered area for people to stand.\nAlong with the nose warmers smokers\nwill be puffing on, the Union intends\nto place patio heaters underneath the\nawning. It is hoped the awning will attract more people to the bars by providing a warm (and dry) area for people to gather outside.\nGSA Chair elected, finally\nLast year\u2019s Deputy President (Finance\nand Services), Jon Matthews was finally allowed to sit on the Graduate Students Association throne after winning\nthe rerun of the GSA Chair election.\nMatthews had no opposition in the\nrerun aside from RON (re-open nomi-nations). RON fought gallantly but\nMatthews pulled through winning by\n58 votes to 42.

We\u2019ll save\nthe rest of you the trouble by summa-rising the basic gist of the series.\nHalo is the veritable Stars Wars of\nthe thumbstick generation. A science-fiction space opera of suitably epic pro-portions, Halo places you in a world\nwhere the human race is, quite frankly,\ngetting their asses handed back to them\nby an (painfully) obviously technologically advanced kindred of aliens called\nthe Covenant. To combat this threat,\nthe free peoples of the world unleash\nthe Master Chief \u2013 a genetically enhanced soldier destined to scrape Covenant entrails from his military-issue\nSpartan boots. His overture adventure\nlanded him on the strange ring-world\nof the titular Halo where he battled\nthe alien threat, made some startling\ndiscoveries and found a group of repugnant failed experiments called the\nFlood. In the end, he somehow managed to destroy the sinister artifact\nbut the fight was only beginning...\nThe second escapade saw the Master\nChief return to defend Earth against\nthe Covenant blitzkrieg. Fans were\nalso surprised that the Chief\u2019s story\nwas one part of a dichotomy that\nwould become a point of dissent for\nmany. The other half of the story was\nproffered by the Arbiter, one of the\nCovenant Elites who discovers that\nhis side are suffering from\nsevere family dysfunc-tion. Combined, they\nweaved a narrative\nthat impressed\nthe wide-eyed\nand presumably drew all-knowing\nchuckles\nfrom anyone who\nbothers\nto watch\nthe news.\nThat\u2019s\nHalo in a\n(somewhat\nripped\napart)\nnutshell.\nWhere\ndoes this leave us with Halo 3? Upon\nthe precipice of a great battle, one\nthat is critical in determining the fate\nof the human race. The apocalyptic\nrevelation about the true nature of\nthe Halos doesn\u2019t make things easier\nto swallow. If you\u2019ve been living under a rock, the Halos are basically the\nplanetary equivalents of WMDs (yes, I\nwent there)... the only difference is that\nthey actually exist... and there are six of\nthem remaining. Yikes.\nCriticism aside, Halo\u2019s storyline\ncomes across as an inspiring, epic es-capade, snugly entrenched within an\nintriguing universe of its own creation.\nDespite having the depth of the common garden hose (same colour, too),\nthe laconic, resilient Master Chief is\nveritably an All-American\u2122 icon of liberty and fraternity, with equality being\ndamned to heck. He\u2019s an elite soldier\nafter all.\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Halo\nhas made significant contributions to\nthe shooter\ngenre,\nalbeit in some cases thrusting previously\nused mechanics into the limelight and\nmaking them seem fresh and new.\nThanks to Bungie, shooters after Halo\ncan boast the strategic armament of\nonly two weapons, re-charging shields/\nlife bars and a general broadening of\nthe FPS spectrum. These changes have\nallowed for enjoyable shifts in pacing\nand strategy, and to be honest, we\u2019re\nall the more better for it. Significantly,\nthe design of the combat in Halo gives\nweight to the characters, making them\ntangible targets in space rather than\nerratically spasmodic polygon models\nthat curse so many other games. FPS\ntitles of the current ilk are strongly\nindebted to the evolutionary, and oft\nrevolutionary, machinations of Halo.\nHowever, all these pale in comparison in light of the multiplayer com-ponent. From a offline, limited player\nexperiment in Halo, the second game\nburst onto the scene with an all-sing-ing, all-dancing multiplayer mode that\nhas become so prominent and pervasive that it is the very definition\nof online console gaming. Nice.\nEven within the offline space,\nHalo 2 offered a robust, holistic communal experience that relentlessly entertains three years on.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Halo\nis a fantastic multiplayer series with a solid\nsingle player patch and\nan entertaining fanfiction attached.\nBungie have truly transformed a\nrisky business undertaking into an entire culture. Cutting a swathe through\nthe PR excretion that is the current\nmarketing drive of Halo 3, we can see\nhow far and wide the previous titles\nhave taken the Xbox. Not only a significant part of the gaming life of countless university students (moreso in the\nUSA than here), Halo is also the base\nfor one of the most popular machi-nama on the Internet. (Machinama is\nthe art of using videogames to create\nvisual media like shows and films.) Red\nvs Blue completed its century-episode\nrun sometime near the end of June this\nyear. Wildly popular, it was a relatively\naimless sitcom that starred a motley\ncrew of personable characters making\nup either the eponymous Red or Blue\nteams. Both start out in conflict with\neach other but soon, things get a little\nmessy and largely hilarious. A film is\ncurrently in the making (with myriad\nsetbacks), but the fact that they have\nLord of the Rings director Peter Jackson\nonboard as a producer gives whim to\nthe scope and ambition of the project.\nRecent nods to the world of Halo are\nless than savoury boiling down to mass\nmarket, shameless advertising ranging\nfrom the Master Chief-themed Mountain Dew Game Fuel to a figurine-based\nmontage clearly aimed at swaying the\nhearts of an impressionable public.\nThere was also the Halo-themed Ferris wheel at the Games Convention in\nGermany if the pictures online are to\nbe believed and stomached. However,\nit\u2019s safe to say that fans of the series\nwill overlook these embarrassments\nand plough on towards their Canaan...\nand it\u2019s really one pilgrimage you\nwouldn\u2019t want to miss as well.\nAt the end of the day, Halo 3\nwill go on to break record sales,\nentrenching itself within the\ngaming community and finding juxtaposition as a premier\nvideogame, a poster child of\nthe interactive medium. In\na year that saw the graceful ending of the similarly\ngargantuan Harry Potter franchise, one\nwonders what\nhonour awaits\nthe Master\nChief.\nThere\u2019s subtlety, and then there\u2019s a genetically-enhanced supersoldier with half an army in his backpack\nThe Heavy & Friends\nTemporary Editors\nG\nreetings, folks. It\u2019s the\nTeam Fortress 2 team\nhere, personified by a\nmystery editor while this\nyear\u2019s Games team gets\nthemselves into formation. What have\nwe got for you this year? Nothing. Because we\u2019re fictional. Even if you can do\na hilarious impression of The Heavy.\nHowever, Felix Games has a lot in\nstore for you this year. We\u2019ve missed\nsome of the biggest releases of the year\nduring Summer \u2013 Team Fortress 2\u2019s\nbeta is well underway, Halo 3 comes\nout the day this first issue goes to press,\nBioShock has already split opinion\nacross the gaming world, and Super\nPaper Mario finally found his way onto\nthe Wii.\nAnd there\u2019s more to come \u2013 Portal\nand Episode 2 will follow Team Fortress 2\u2019s official release this October,\nthere\u2019s the fallout from Halo 3\u2019s multiplayer impact on the scene, as well\nas the usual Christmas rush that\u2019ll be\npacked full of games you want, but\ncan\u2019t afford, and then buy anyway and\ngo without food for a month. It\u2019s the\nway of the gamer.\nFor those new to Imperial, and for\nthose whose memories of last year are\nhazy, Felix Games would love writers.\nWe want anyone who\u2019s able to put pen\nto paper \u2013 you don\u2019t need to be well-established journalists, you just need\nto have a passion for gaming and a\nwillingness to take criticism. If you\u2019d\nlike to write features, comment pieces,\nreviews or other stuff for us, drop us a\nline on the email address at the top of\nthis page.\nWe\u2019re hoping to branch out this year.\nNot us personally, obviously,because of\nthe fictional thing still, but the section\nas a whole. We want gamers from every\nwalk of life to take part in Felix, to keep\nthings interesting and arrange events\nfor us. We\u2019ll still be working closely\nwith Imperial\u2019s Computer Games Club\n(CGC) to keep you abreast of their upcoming tournaments, and we might\neven get some gaming sessions of our\nown arranged.\nHowever you\u2019re playing this Winter,\nwe hope Felix Games has something\nto offer you. If there\u2019s something you\nwant to see more of, or if you\u2019re sick\nof the sight of something we\u2019re doing\nalready, please email us and tell us. We\nmight be too busy playing Halo 3 until our eyes dry up, but someone will\neventually read it and do something\nabout it.\nAs for the guys here, we\u2019re off to\n2Fort to call people nubs and shout\npewpewpew whilst generally spamming and pissing everyone off to the\nhighest degree possible. You might be\nfamiliar with our work in every single\nonline game, ever. We hope you enjoy\nit here too.\nSee you online. Normal service will\nbe resumed next issue.\nGood Doctor!

It\u2019s no Monster\nWhere a movie star begins and ends\nMost Hollywood actors are the same\nnowadays, right? Big bucks, tonnes\nof fame, good physiques, on occasion even talent \u2013 all the prerequisites\nneeded to be a \u201cstar\u201d. But of course,\nstars shine up on the sky only because\nlight is shed upon them and while we\nmay still see them during clear nights,\nthey might have actually died out years\nago. The question is, what can an actor\ndo to redeem himself from the infectious disease called Hollywood and its\nutterly commercial aspects before it\u2019s\ntoo late?\nCharlize Theron is just one of several examples which show how being\na Hollywood star must not necessarily\nimply that you have to sell out on all\nyour values.\nBorn 1975 and raised in a small farm\ncommunity in South Africa, Theron\u2019s\nchildhood automatically sets her apart\nfrom most Hollywood actors. Beside\nthe fact that she was born in a country where a profound humane crisis\nwas taking place, Theron witnessed\nher father\u2019s death at the hands of her\nmother \u2013 in self defence \u2013 at the age of\nfifteen. Just one year later, she moved\nout on her own to pursue a modelling\ncareer in Milan. A trip to the US and\nseveral painstaking years into the fu-ture, Theron is discovered by an agent\nwhile yelling her lungs out at a bank in\nLos Angeles.\nThe year 1996 marked her first major\nrole in a film co-starring James Spader,\nTwo Days in the Valley, a rather ludicrous but fun picture about money,\nmurder and vendettas. In years to\ncome, Theron kept being type-cast\nas the beautiful, bitter/sweet blonde\nwho always managed to get herself (or\nsomeone else) into trouble.\nOf course, Hollywood only acknowledged her work once she did a complete makeover of herself for Monster\n(2003), a performance which saw her\ngarner not only heaps of praise, but\nalso an Academy Award for Best Leading Actress (she was nominated again\nfor North Country, in 2005). You might\nthink at this point that perhaps it was\ntime for Miss Theron to more carefully\nchoose the films she accepts to star in\nand it would only make sense, after\nshe herself said in an interview something along the lines that \u2018she\u2019d never\nbe able to go back to doing something\nordinary again\u2019 after the experience of\nmaking Monster. Aeon Flux and Head\nin the Clouds, two films extremely different in most regards, but similar in\nterms of cinematic experience (unsat-isfying, to say the least) came as quite a\nblow to both Theron\u2019s own words and\nmost people\u2019s expectations.\nYet, it would be erroneous to say\nnothing has changed. The roles taken\nup in North Country, Monster, even\nHead in the Clouds, show a penchant\nfor deeper, more complicated and in\nthe same time more heroic characters,\nfor people who stand out in an adverse\nsociety. Theron just recently produced\na film called East of Havana, a documentary about three young rappers in\nCuba, and her next three pictures are\nthemed around human drama (Ferris\nWheel, In the Valley of Elah) or social\nactivists (Battle in Seattle). The fact\nthat she\u2019s signed on for the sequel to\nThe Italian Job only shows that, in the\nend, it\u2019s still Charlize Theron we\u2019re\ntalking about, an adventurous, beautiful woman of the 21st century.\nSo what does it take to gain immunity from the Hollywood virus? Well,\nit takes self-consciousness, and while\nmost stars nowadays go for a \u201cgreener\u201d\nlifestyle and mime social awareness,\nit\u2019s still rare to find someone who actually looks at the world and aims to\nbecome an integral part of it. Charlize\nTheron, although she\u2019s still got a long\nroad ahead, is venturing herself in becoming more than just a product in the\nfilm industry.\nStefan Carpanu goes in search of something beyond a star to explore the great charm of Charlize Theron\nMuch more than just a Flighty Tart\nShe\u2019s back and she\u2019s black, but does Angelina still have the acting chops to pull off Mariane Pearl\u2019s story?\nA year ago, this was perhaps the most\ntalked about film going into production but now that it\u2019s finally released,\nit has slipped under the radar a bit.\nWhether it was controversy over Angelina being \u201cblacked up\u201d to play mixed\nrace Mariane Pearl or whether it was\nthe world shifting into its orbit around,\neugh, Brangelina, early pictures were\neverywhere and the focus was immediately taken from the powerful true\nlife story itself.\nIn a move so typical of the celebrity\nworshipping world of today, Angelina\u2019s\nstory grabbed the limelight while the\ncourageous story of Mariane Pearl\nwhose husband, journalist Daniel Pearl\nwas captured and beheaded by a Pakistani militant group, was pushed to the\nback. Months on and Brad and Angelina are old news while their take (with\nBrad as producer) on the Pearls\u2019 story\ngets a chance to shine. But the main\nproblem is the film doesn\u2019t fit well in\nthe cinema mould.\nIt\u2019s a deeply personal story, one\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nwoman\u2019s struggle to find her husband\nin Karachi whilst heavily pregnant and\nis based on Mariane\u2019s memoirs of the\ntragic events. Here the story is out of\nMariane\u2019s hands and, whilst dealt with\nskillfully, doesn\u2019t quite keep an audience hooked for the running time.\nThe problem with taking such a recent story is the intrusiveness of the\nwhole thing makes an audience feel\nlike uncomfortable voyeurs and whilst\nMariane is not one-dimensional, the\nstory is fundamentally hopeless and\nwould better suit a documentary than\na dramatisation.\nSaying that, were it not for the dram-atisation, it would be without Angelina\u2019s performance which should quiet-en critics and replace \u201cactress\u201d on her\nCV alongside \u201cpublicly vilified scarlet\nwoman\u201d. Her accent holds up and her\nperformance is not based in tears and\ndramatics like it could have easily been\ndirected. She plays a stronger woman\nthan that and does so with convction,\nwhether or not it was right to cast her\nwhen many mixed race actresses would\nhave killed for a role like this. The fact\nthat boyfriend Brad was producing\ndoesn\u2019t imply a large search went on\nfor the best actress for the role but it\nwould have been much easier to bring\nthe race card down had she not carried\nit off. As it stands however, Jolie seems\ncapable of getting that edge back, and\nwith her turn in Beowulf approaching\nit\u2019s hard to see her signing on for Tomb\nRaider 3.\nA Mighty Heart \u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom\nWriters: John Orloff, Marianne\nPearl\nCast: Angelina Jolie, Archie\nPanjabi\nJolie goes back to school and learns how to act again...\n\n"

Then he\u2019ll begin\nT\nhe website of the National\nNovel Writing Month\ntakes a rather softly-softly approach to its\nwording in order to\nattract quiet, literary types, so if\nyou\u2019re one of the delicate ones\nI suggest you skip on right to\nthe end where I\u2019ve typed the\nsite address in italics, and\nscurry along to the cool safety\nof what\u2019s known as NaNoWriMo by those that take part.\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learnt\nthrough three years of trying to get people to enter the\ndamn thing, it\u2019s that no-one\ndoes it if you\u2019re nice to them.\nEveryone else should sit down,\nshut up, and read on.\nHave you ever wanted to\nwrite a story? Bear in mind\nI\u2019m not asking whether English is your first language, or\nwhether you\u2019ve taken writing lessons, or whether your\nmother and father nurtured\nyour creative abilities from a\nyoung age, lending you lamp-light, quills, a steady supply of\nink and a mentor named Albert. I mean, did you play make-believe games as a child? Did you\never think that your favourite TV\nshow or film could do a bit better in\nsome parts? Did you ever read a book\nthat you thought missed something\nout? Because the funny thing is that\nmost people do have a desire to write,\nand everyone \u2013 everyone \u2013 can.\nOh, but you\u2019re worried about not\nbeing so good, right? Well, you\u2019re\nnot good. Let\u2019s not be silly here, with\nyour attitude you\u2019re probably terrible\nat writing right at this moment. But a\nmonth\u2019s worth of solid writing is going\nto change that, and it\u2019s going to change\nyou. So here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do\nthis November \u2013 you\u2019re going to write\nfifty-thousand words of original fic-tion. You\u2019re going to do it because if\nyou don\u2019t do it right now, right this\nyear, right here at Imperial, then you\nnever will. That\u2019s the what. You know\nwhat you\u2019re going to do. Here\u2019s why.\nThe why is very simple \u2013 firstly,\nwe\u2019ve established that you think it\nwould be A Pretty Cool Thing To Do.\nForget about the idea of writing almost two thousand words a day for a\nsecond, and imagine waltzing around\nin December with a novel under your\nbelt, a novel that no-one ever needs to\nread, but that you can be proud of, and\nslip into conversation with the casual\nair of a young Jeffrey Archer. \u201cOh golly,\ndarling, it\u2019s been so long! Yes, I know.\nYou know, I would have, but I was just\nfinishing off my novel, and you know\nwhat it\u2019s like when you\u2019ve done forty-five kay already, mmm?\u201d\nAlthough it should be pointed out,\nmost people don\u2019t do it in order to add\na dash of smarminess to parties. The\nreal reason for someone such as yourself to do NaNoWriMo is because now\nis the time you\u2019ll flesh out the person\nyou are. You\u2019re more free than you ever\nhave been, and yet not burdened with\nthe full weight of decision-making.\nYou\u2019re busy enough to justify the large\namounts of free time that you have, but\nnot so busy that the time is unusable.\nMost of all, you\u2019ve got your dreams,\nand your chances to reach out for them\nare thinning out. Don\u2019t be fooled, those\nof you who dream of a high-paying job\nthat\u2019ll retire you at thirty-five. It\u2019s now\nthat you\u2019ll do the things your grandchildren will hear about, not then.\nThe idea began with just a few\nfriends, but now spans the globe and\nwill lead more than forty thousand\npeople to the goal of fifty-thousand\nwords this November when it kicks off\nfor its ninth year. It\u2019s a group that\u2019s now\norganised, a fully-fledged charity that\u2019s\nset up children\u2019s libraries in Vietnam\nand Lagos thanks to donations from the\npeople who were encouraged to write\ntheir first, then second, then maybe\nsixth novel. But at the same time, it\u2019s\nstill a simple bunch of people working behind a simple idea \u2013 that writing\nis fun, and not enough people realise\nthat. To that end, they encourage, egg\non and sometimes push you towards\nthe goal that, at times, will seem even\nfurther off than it does now.\nThere are weekly podcasts, local\nmeets with like-minded writers, and an\nonline forum buzzing with orphaned\nnovel ideas, experts on every conceivable topic, and people who are just as\nworried and confused as you are. And\nyes, they probably got tricked by some\nstudent journalist too.\nAnd if that\u2019s not your thing, then you\ncan work in complete isolation \u2013 even\nthe word checker that deals out your\ncertificate at the end of November is\nentirely automated, and so if you want\nit to be a private thing, they\u2019re just as\nhappy to have you. They have people\nwriting by hand, writing in Greek,\nwriting novels to get published or just\nwriting. They don\u2019t even force you to\ndonate money to their cause \u2013 they\u2019re\njust there to give you an idea to get\nstarted, and a reason to keep going.\nThis year, Felix wants to do the same.\nSo we\u2019ll be covering the National Novel\nWriting Month in a series of short reports during November, as well as some\nwarmup articles this October. If you\u2019ve\nentered before, please get in touch with\nus and let us know more. If you\u2019re going to attempt it this year, we\u2019d love for\nyou to do the same. If you\u2019re not sure\nwhether you can handle it, after all the\nmixed metaphors and poor pep talks\nI\u2019ve attempted, I can only leave you\nwith this \u2013 it\u2019s worth giving a chance.\nThe feeling of accomplishment, the\nway the enthusiasm filters through\nto other aspects of your life, and the\nconfidence it gives you in your day-to-day living is unique and unbelievable.\nWriting is a novel is something many\nof us say we will do, one day. There are\nthirty of those One Days coming up.\nMake sure you\u2019re ready for them.\nTo find out more about the\nNational Novel Writing Month,\nvisit their website at http://www.\nnanowrimo.org. If you\u2019re going\nto enter this year\u2019s competition,\nwe\u2019d love to hear from you \u2013 arts.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk.\nAre You Serious? \u2013 FAQs\nWho will read my novel when\nI\u2019m done?\nAnyone you want. Last year,\nsome people swapped novels afterwards and it was a hoot. But\nit\u2019s entirely up to you. No one\nwill read your novel until you\u2019re\nready for them to.\nIs there a fee to participate?\nThere\u2019s no sign-up fee, but we\ndo ask ably-financed participants\nto contribute something towards\nhosting and administrative costs.\nThe amount is up to you.\nWhen do I start writing?\nAt 12:00:01 am local time on November 1.\nHow do you win? Are there\njudges? What are the prizes?\nThe way to win NaNoWriMo is by\nwriting 50,000 words by midnight\non November 30. Every year,\nthere are many, many winners.\nThere are no \u201cBest Novel\u201d or\n\u201cQuickest-Written Novel\u201d awards\ngiven out. All winners will get an\nofficial \u201cWinner\u201d web icon and\ncertificate.\nCan I handwrite the novel?\nAbsolutely. We can\u2019t verify your\nword count, but verification is\njust icing on the NaNoWriMo\ncake.\nWhat if I start and don\u2019t finish?\nThat\u2019s ok. Nothing ventured,\nnothing gained, right?\nWhy are you doing this? What\ndo you get out of it?\nNaNoWriMo is all about the\nmagical power of deadlines.\nGive someone a goal and a goal-minded community and miracles\nare bound to happen. Pies will\nbe eaten at amazing rates. Alfalfa\nwill be harvested like never be-fore. And novels will be written\nin a month.\nPart of the reason we organize\nNaNoWriMo is just to get a book\nwritten. For one month out of the\nyear, we can stew and storm, and\nmake a huge mess of our apartments and drink lots of coffee at\nodd hours. And we can do all of\nthese things loudly, in front of\npeople.\nBut that artsy drama window is\nwoefully short. The other reason\nwe do NaNoWriMo is because\nthe glow from making big, messy\nart, and watching others make\nbig, messy art, lasts for a long,\nlong time. It changes the way\nyou read. And changes, a little\nbit, your sense of self.\nWe like that.\nHow do you pronounce\nNaNoWriMo?\nNAN-no WRY-Mo.\nOh. I\u2019ve been saying it NAN-no\nWREE-Mo.\nThat\u2019s ok too.\n\u201cSo here\u2019s\nwhat you\u2019re\ngoing to do\nthis November\n\u2013 you\u2019re going\nto write fifty-thousand words\nof original\nfiction.\u201d\n\n"

Think\nceramics, furniture, fashion, glass, jewellery, metalwork, photographs, sculpture, textiles and paintings. Some exhibits are a bit dated, but it is nothing a good bout of government funding won\u2019t heal. Apart from that, it is really\nworth a visit during those long lunch breaks. Go on \u2013 free yourself from the JCR!\nBest bits:\nThe Jameel Gallery is a real gem. The Islamic Middle East collection has been lovingly relocated to this very atmospheric and beautiful gallery, thanks to some very rich and generous people. It really does credit to the objects\ndisplayed which originate from areas stretching from Andalucian Spain all the way to the northern reaches of\nUzbekistan. A highlight is the the oldest carpet in existance which lies in state here (non-flying).\nFor all you cross-dressers out there, The British Galleries will be of great interest. There are several \u2018hands-on\u2019\nexhibits which involve putting on hoop skirts and corsets on for fun and admiring your changed appearence in\nhandy mirrors.\nA sparkly-new exhibition, \u2018The Golden Age of Couture\u2019 has just opened. See our review in this issue for more\ninformation.\nThe Natural History Museum,\nCromwell Road\nDifficult to miss if you\u2019ve ever approached Imperial from the South Kensington tube, this magnificent building dominates Cromwell Road and even loops around to rub shoulders with the Science\nMuseum. If you want a definitive exhibited history of this planet, it\u2019s all under one roof. Its proximity to the college is fortunate, because this\u2019ll take you some time to get around fully.\nBest bits:\nGo in the main entrance (on Cromwell Road) and the first thing you\u2019ll see is the museum\u2019s most\npopular resident \u2013 the enormous dinosaur skeleton that dominates the entire main atrium. But\nthat\u2019s not all there is to offer \u2013 in every direction the museum plunges into the history of animals,\nnature and even humankind itself.\nBe sure to explore towards the back of the museum, where a massive escalator will take you up\nto an earthquake simulation room, which is great fun as long as no-one\u2019s watching, and continues\non to explore natural disasters and the escalating issue of our climate. It\u2019s Climate Change Season\nat the museum at the moment, which means the exhibitions all have a global warming twist, but\nkeep an eye on the banners outside, as the museum\u2019s fantastic lineup is constantly changing.\nThe Science Museum,\nExhibition Road\nOriginally founded in 1857 to house all the leftover bits from the Great Exhbition at Crystal Palace, our\nmost local museum is now a showroom of scientific artefacts from throughout history. For us scientists,\nit is a brilliant resource for background info on how science and technology has evolved through the\nages. The museum has some suprising annexes too: The Dana Centre on Queens Gate is a cafebar venue\nfor over-18\u2019s and hosts debates almost every night of the week about contemporary science and culture.\nComing up is an evening with James Watson, the one who also disovered DNA. Cool.\nBest bits:\nThey are just renovating the Launchpad which is the biggest hands-on exhibit in the place. This means\nlots of big buttons to press and disapproving looks from onlooking parents as you push small children out\nof the way in order to get a go.\nAlso coming up is a unique exhibiiton by celebrated film maker, Grace Weir and explores our scientific\nmeasurement of time, black holes and Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity.\nChapter One \u2013 Museums\n\n"

Couture is the French term for\n\u201cdressmaking\u201d, and haute means \u201chigh\u201d.\nHence, the literal translation of haute\ncouture is \u201chigh dressmaking\u201d, in the\nsame way the microscopic portions in\nyour local Michelin-starred restaurant\nare referred to as \u201chaute cuisine\u201d.\nHaute couture is the pinnacle, the\nabsolute peak of creative expression\nthrough the medium of dress (gents \u2013\nthe equivalent of a bespoke Savile Row\nthree-piece with matching shoes, only\nat least three times more expensive\nand ten times more coveted). Haute\ncouture combines untempered artistic\nflair with made-to-measure precision.\nCommissioned by the wealthiest of\npatrons and created by only the most\nskilled designers and their ateliers\n(workshops), couture is regarded as\nmuch as collectors items and museum-worthy pieces as clothes. Dolce & Gabbana? Not even close.\nEven your relatively average couture\ngown would put all but the most special of wedding dresses in the shade\n\u2013 the most extravagant and elegant sit\ncomfortably alongside the private jet\nand Lamborghini on the wishlists of\nfashionistas and romantics the world\nover.\nThus, to the V&A\u2019s autumn exhibi-tion. The Golden Age examines in detail the period after the Second World\nWar when Christian Dior introduced\nthe now-legendary New Look, Cristobal Balenciaga reopened his doors\nand the stellar talents of Hubert de\nGivenchy and Pierre Balmain rose to\nprominence.\nThe period is regarded as one of the\nmost glamorous and remarkable in\nfashion history, not only for the extraordinary bloom of creativity that\ntook place, but also for Dior\u2019s revolu-tionising of the industry and the swan-song of an era that ended with the sixties and the advent of a mass market\nmore directed to teenagers and pr\u00eat-aporter (ready to wear).\nThe period and the New Look\n(rounded shoulders, nipped-in waist\nexpanding into dramatically long and\nwide skirts) also saw a return to ethereal glamour and luxury after the austerity of the war.\n95% of the exhibition is from the\nV&A\u2019s remarkable archives, but is\nalso notable in that it includes original pieces from Dior\u2019s first collection\nand the painstakingly restored Zemire\nensemble, which was previously only\nknown to editors and researchers\nthrough photographs and recently rediscovered in a building on the banks\nof the Seine.\nStepping through the hushed spaces\nresplendent with the quiet stir of archive footage, it feels more like witnessing a private labour of love than waltzing through an exhibition. A room is\ndedicated to the process of creating a\ncouture gown, from the preparatory\nsketches and material samples right\ndown to the accessories and finished\nproduct; one could spend hours in this\nroom alone.\nAnother is given over to the ima-gemakers favoured by the emerging\ninternational press, namely familiar\npublications like Vogue and Harpers.\nWhere previously illustrations had\nbeen used, photographers such as Richard Avedon and Cecil Beaton dominated during the postwar years as the\nmedium had a modernity that editors\nfavoured.\nThe trend of showing the \u201cface\u201d as\nopposed to the whole figure emerged\nduring this time as large cosmetics advertisers such as Elizabeth Arden began to take more space in the increasingly influential fashion press.\nLovers of all things Audrey Hepburn will be glad to know her favoured\ncouturier is well represented \u2013 show-stopping Givenchy couture dresses are\namongst the best of the entire exhibition \u2013 and a reel shows film footage of\nfamous film fashion moments, including the aforementioned Ms. Hepburn\u2019s\nParisian romp in Funny Face.\nMost dramatic of all though is a\nroom dedicated to the most achingly\nbeautiful couture of the whole collec-tion; the wealth of beauty on display\nhere is worth the admission alone.\nPieces from familiar names such as\nDior, Balenciaga and Givenchy stand\nalongside those from the less familiar\nsuch as Fath, Lelong and Schiaparelli.\nAll are stunning.\nThe exhibition returns us round into\nthe present with a timeline dating the\nemergence of major players and the\nestablishment of the regulatory Chambre Syndicale, ending with three pieces\nfrom the most dramatic couturier of\nthe present day, Dior\u2019s John Galliano.\nThough the couture from British\ndressmakers such as Hardy Amies is\nworthy in itself as to compete with\ntheir contemporaries on the continent,\nthe vast majority will come to see the\nwell-known names, though even the\nmost avid couture fan will have something to learn.\nThe breadth and depth of research\nand effort that has gone into this exhibition is obvious and it shows \u2013 The\nGolden Age is a fitting tribute to a dying craft.\nSublime.\nDavid asked to try this on, but they said they weren\u2019t big on that.\n\n"

Once in our supplies\ntown of Courmayeur, siesta put\npaid to us obtaining supplies, so\nwe were forced to eat ice-cream\nin the sunshine. Boy, was it tough.\nFinally stocked up with pasta and\nmore cheese, we began climbing\na steep zigzag track amongst the\ncool shade of trees until Courmayeur was a toy village, 700m\nbelow. Rising over a final bluff we\nhad a stunning view of Mont Ch\u00e9tif, and, from the camping ground\nabove a refuge (2000m), finally\nviews of Mont Blanc itself. Just as\nwe set up camp, a farmer drove\nhis cow herd around our tents until we were surrounded!\nDay 6 promised fine weather so\nthe alarm was set for sunrise to\nsee Mont Blanc. We reached the\npeak of T\u00eate Bernade (2534m) for\nelevenses and found a suitable patch of snow\nfor a snowball fight. It had stupendous 360\u00b0 views to Col de la Seign\n(crossed on day 3) and onwards\nto Grand col Ferret (tomorrow\u2019s\ntarget). Lunch concluded with\nsledging down a snow field on\nsurvival sacks. The climb to the\nsecond col was interrupted by our\nfirst sighting of an ibex; Wilfred\u2019s\nsuper zoom lens was quickly put\ninto action. We wandered down\nVal Malatra and stayed the night\nin the luxurious Rifugio Bonatti.\nCharlie set us a good pace on\nday 7 along a stunning contouring path above Val Ferret. By\nmidday it was pretty damn hot,\nnot helping the steepness of the\nclimb, so we lunched on a glorious spur with valley and glacial\nviews just below the Grand col\nFerret (Swiss-Italian border). The\nunending descent that afternoon\ntired us all out, but Honorary Morale Officer Al brought the spirit\nback to the group with a good ol\u2019\nsing-song. Tired and weary we arrived at La Fouly in time to meet\nMatt and Martin who arrived\non the bus. We wined and dined\nout at a restaurant to celebrate\nthe week\u2019s achievements thus far\nand to say farewell to Monica and\nhello to newcomers.\nAfter a rest day and our\nnumbers now swelled\nto 11, day 9\nwas another \u2018easy\u2019 route to break the\nnewbies in. At the very serene\nChampex Lac, and with only the\nmerest hint of sunshine, Al, Dave\nand Anna couldn\u2019t resist a dip,\nwhilst the rest of us explored the\nextensive local patisserie coun-ter. Once camped at we cooked\ndinner (which included dried\nonions, more on these later) and\nheard that bad weather might\nthwart the next\u2019s day\u2019s crossing of\nthe Fen\u00eatre d\u2019Arpette.\nDay 10. The pre-5am alarm signalled a long day \u2013 we would attempt the highest, toughest crossing of the TMB before the weather\nturned! In the calm morning we\nmade steady progress up the val-ley, with the view behind improving with every step. It was around\nthis time that the consequences\nof the previous night\u2019s meal were\nsolidifying (or not). The cause of\nexcess flatulence among all members of the party was the inclusion\nof too many onions in said meal.\nWe were dying an onion death in\nthis windless valley (although it\nwas powering us up the moun-tain). Al even blew a hole in his\nshorts. Upon reaching the tour\u2019s\nhigh point of 2665m we were sadly rewarded with little view and\nworsening rain. Tired, wet but\nhappy we arrived at\nLe\nTim Scarbrough and his fellow fellwanderers go\nfor a quick walk around the base of Mont Blanc and find\nthemselves taking a slight detour on their way\nhair-straighteners on tour! A Fellwanderers first!\nDay 2 had undecided weather as\nthe trail wound among pastures,\nrocks and then snow fields to our\nfirst serious pass \u2013 at 2329m Col\ndu Bonhomme was quite a chilly\nplace. Just before reaching the\nhigher, second pass of the day the\nweather came in, with thunder\nthreatening us. We successfully\nnavigated off the col through the\ncloud and practically stumbled on\nthe planned night\u2019s refuge appearing eerily out of the mist. We arrived in the nick of time: two minutes later golf ball sized hailstones\nbombarded the landscape!\nThe weather had not improved\novernight, and day 3 saw two\ninches of fresh snow. Consequently we took the longer but\nlower route via Les Chapieux.\nBy mid afternoon we crossed the\nCol de la Seign (2516m), on the\nFranco-Italian border, where the\nweather was a little unforgiving\nwith strong winds.Following the\nmap rather than snow-prints we\nquickly descended to snow fields,\npausing just long enough for Al to\nplunge head first (with rucksack!)\ndown the slope. We\u2019d intended to\ncamp by the Refuge Elisabetta but\nwith the howling wind and rain/\nsnow, and the option of a dry bed\nfor \u20ac17, only Chris was foolish\nenough to pitch. With an easier\nday following, the beers flowed\n(especially in Anna\u2019s case).\nAfter Al had finished prancing\naround in a toga and Anna\u2019s hot\npants as Party Boy, day 4 included\na balcony path, which afforded us\nexcellent views down the valleys\nVeni and Ferret, and across to the\ncloud-clad Aiguilles Noir. The\npath rose and fell over streams,\nsnow fields and past lakes,\nat one of which we lunched\non more local cheese. The\ncampsite that afternoon\nwas sunny and had\nenough space to play\nFrisbee! The cold\nwind after dinner\nforced us to keep\nactive, right until\nthe frisbee had\nto be hilariously\nsalvaged from a\ntree using a telephone pole!\nFellwanderers Tour of Mont Blanc\nT\nhe morning after\nthe end of the undergraduate term\nheralded the start\nof the Fellwanderers Summer Tour; our destina-tion: Mont Blanc. To be precise we weren\u2019t about to join\nthe thousands to the summit\nof Europe, but to embark on an\nentire anticlockwise circumnavigation of the Mont Blanc\nMassif. The Tour du Mont\nBlanc would lead us from\nFrance into Italy and Switzerland, before reappearing back\ninto France, twelve days and\nseveral kilometres later. The\nTMB is one of Europe\u2019s most\npopular long-distance mountain walks; however with\nmuch snow still lying, this was\nthe beginning of the season\nand the trails would not be\nfull. We planned to camp for\nthe majority of nights to keep\ncosts down, but interspersed\nwith a few refuges for both\nconvenience and comfort.\nIt was a clear day in Les\nHouches in the Chamonix valley where nine of us convened\nat the campsite, surrounded\nby jaw-dropping snow-capped\nAlps. By chance, the town festival was that very evening,\nso our tour kicked off in style\nwith celebrations around an\nover-zealous bonfire, music\nand a BBQ.\nDay 1 began under blue\nskies and the group\u2019s first (of\nmany) tastes of my pre-mixed\ncocaine-look-alike Readybrek\nmix. Col de Voza (1653m)\nwas breached at midday with\ntremendous views up to the\nBionnassay glacier. Fond previous tour memories came\nflooding back once the mountaineer\u2019s lunch of hunks of\nbread, large blocks of cheese\n(which featured considerably)\nand dried sausage were got\nout. We refuelled at a cool water trough, drenched our caps\nand refilled our water pistols.\nDuring the final stretch along\nthe Montjoie valley Monica\nwas requested to extract the\nfirst-aid kit, and it transpired\nshe had brought self-powering\n\n"

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 28 September 2007 felix\nNews\nMeanwhile in the Union...\nSouthside \u201cfar exceeded our expectations\u201d\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nLeft, the main stairwell in the Falmouth-Keogh hall\u2019s entrance. The stair rails contain lights to help intoxicated students clamber the steps back\nto their rooms. Right, one of the controversial \u201crestricted view\u201d rooms. The portacabins will remain in view until Eastside is finished in 2009\nCommunal kitchens are shared between a maximum of 24 students.\nKitchens come equipped with recyclable waste cupboards and energy\nsaving lights activated via infra-red when someone enters the room\nShock! Horror! The Sabbatical Officers were caught doing work,\nand at the weekend. The ICU President Steve Brown (top) and\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare) Kirsty Patterson (bottom)\nwere part of a team repainting dB\u2019s. Instead of paying contractors\n\u00a33,500 to begin the refurbishment, the Sabbatical Officers decided\nto take a more pro-active approach and save the Union some\nmoney in the process. Hopefully by Freshers\u2019 Week dB\u2019s will house\nsome cosy sofas and be serving some tasty breakfast food.\nThe new Southside halls were handed\nover by contractors to College earlier this week. Wardens have already\nmoved in, along with the \u201cre-apps\u201d (re-applicants, or students who have been\ngranted another year in halls but in\nreturn they have to help out with running the residence) before around 400\nfreshers descend upon Southside this\nweekend.\nOn wednesday morning Felix was\nlucky enough to be given a tour of\nSouthside, namely the Falmouth-Keogh hall. The other two halls are also\nnamed after the previous Southside\nblock \u2013 Selkirk hall and Tizard hall.\nTogether, the three halls fall under the\numbrella name of Southside. Felix met\nwith Falmouth-Keogh warden Dan\nRead, who would be our guide on the\ntour.\nStudents gain access through the\nmain entrance door via the RFID chip\nin their College ID card. Keys to rooms\nare also a thing of the past in Southside,\nhowever they are still required to access some things such as the mailboxes.\nSimilar RFID security is in place when\ngaining access to students\u2019 rooms, creating even more incentive for students\nnot to lose their College ID cards unless they want to spend a night sleeping on the hard kitchen floors.\nAfter passing through the main doors\nof the entrance, you are immediately\nswamped with bright red colour. It is\nstylishly lit with lights set into the floor\nand even the stair rail.\nFelix was then taken to the fourth\nfloor. Stepping out of the lift, it was apparent that the hallways are vast, potentially raising the question whether\nthis space could (or should) have been\nused to make the bedrooms larger.\nFelix was shown a single en-suite\nroom facing south. Each room comes\nwith the standard items a resident\nwould expect. There are tall, glass\npanelled doors that stretch from the\nfloor to the ceiling allowing in plenty\nof light. The doors are locked however,\npreventing students from accessing the\nfaux-balconies, presumably to prevent\npeople from leaping to their death.\nThe next destination of Felix\u2019s whis-tle-stop tour took us to one of the communal kitchens. Brushed metal is the\norder of the day here. The kitchens are\ndesigned to hold a maximum of 24 stu-dents. Aside from the usual lockable\ncupboards and various kitchen appli-ances, Southside halls have a specific\narea for recyclable waste. The kitchens\nare also fitted with infra-red lights that\nturn on and off depending whether\nsomeone is in the room. College has\nobviously been thinking green and\nwhilst the kitchens may look the part,\nthe old fashioned induction cooker\nhobs seem greatly misplaced in an otherwise very modern building.\nNext up, Felix was shown one of the\nen-suite bedrooms facing north: the\nside with the much discussed view of\nthe portacabins next door. The porta-cabins are in place until building work\non Eastside is completed in 2009. Students assigned rooms with a restricted\nview have been given a \u00a35.00 per week\nreduction on their rent, taking the\ncost of a single en-suite room down to\n\u00a3150.61. Over the course of a 38-week\ncontract this equates to a \u00a3190.00 dis-count. The decision to reduce the cost\nof the affected rooms was made earlier\nin the month after negotiations between College\u2019s Commercial Services\ndepartment and the Union, namely\nKirsty Patterson (Deputy President\nEducation and Welfare).\nThe views from the north side are\ncertainly restricted, but plenty of light\nstill fills the rooms. With the window\nopen, the drilling of noisy builders\ncould be heard but when shut, the\ndouble glazing was effective enough to\nensure near silence.\nFalmouth-Keogh is the westernmost\nhallandunfortunatelyFelixcouldn\u2019tget\naccess into Selkirk or Tizard on the day.\nThis meant we weren\u2019t able to compare\nthe portacabin view with views over\nthe Eastside building site itself. If there\nwas anything sinister going on in the\nother halls, it will become apparent in\nthe coming weeks. Perhaps Felix was\nlucky in being spared the sight of some\nimpressive builders\u2019 bums.\nFinally we were shown a twin room\nand also a twin disabled room. The\nrooms differ in size depending on\ntheir location in the building and in\nthis reporter\u2019s view the twin room we\nwere shown seemed too small for two\npeople. The pair of desks were situated\nside-by-side which seemed a bit too\nclose for comfort and privacy. However, the twin disabled room was vast\nwith a huge, fully equipped bathroom\ndesigned for wheelchair users. Pillows\nthat vibrate during a fire alarm are also\navailable for the hard of hearing.\nFrom what we were shown, Southside looks good and far exceeded our\nexpectations. Our tour was only of the\nFalmouth-Keogh hall so Felix was not\nin a position to search every nook and\ncranny of Southside, so our trip may\nhave left a few stones unturned. The\nmain areas that we weren\u2019t allowed into\nare the unfinished areas, most notably\nthe social room. Falmouth-Keogh, Selkirk and Tizard will each have their\nown common rooms and additionally\nthere will be a larger social room capable of holding all of the students from\none of the sub-halls. The social room\nwill not be finished when the freshers\narrive this weekend. College has said\nthat it will be finished during October.\nStudents lucky enough to get a place\nin Southside will be living in luxury ac-commodation. Whether \u00a3155.61 per\nweek is too much for a single en-suite\nroom in Southside is open to debate.\n\n"

    "content": "were on the whole more sober, but I\nwas irked as I can drink neither wine\nnor beer and feel that should I wish to\ndrink spirits I am responsible enough\nto decide how much I can drink before becoming a threat to society. I\nalso believe people should always be\ngiven a choice, as one can always use\nproportional pricing to guide buying\ntoward the favoured option anyway.\nThis particularly European attitude\nto sociable drinking translates to very\namicable people and the crowds were\nenthused and happy enough, certainly\npolite and well spaced, with none of\nthe moshing or crowd surfing you find\nat similar British festivals. If you want\nto get right to the front of any stage, it\nis as surprisingly easy as just weaving\nyour way over there and people generally tended to move around a lot from\nstage to stage rather than camp out in\none place to keep their spot or to see\nthe whole line-up at one tent or stage.\nThis fluidity was wonderful and meant\nyou didn\u2019t feel pressured to rush to\neach band if times clashed as you knew\nyou would be able to view the bands as\ncomfortably from the beginning as arriving mid way through.\nBands received attentive though un-derwhelming reactions from the crowd\nand it was somehow rather deflating to\nbe around people who appear so utterly\nunfussy over what they are experienc-ing. Just one example would be watching The Kings Of Leon who were on at\nmid-afternoon at Pukkelpop and for\nwhom there was a modest crowd who\nsang along and bopped a bit I the sunshine to their set. Cue reading, where\nthey co-headlined the main stage to a\npacked and eager audience Pukkelpop\nI was able to get right to middle of the\nfront barrier of the main stage for the\nSaturday night headliners The Smashing Pumpkins during the changeover\nfrom the previous band, something I\ncould only dream of doing had I been\nglued there to the barrier staking out\nmy space form about early afternoon\nat Reading\nThe one thing I did find slightly bemusing and overall a tad exasperating was the lack of joy and excitement\nthere was for the bands. For as annoying as being crushed to death at your\nfavourite band is, or not being able to\nget within 50 yards of a stage or even\ninside a tent, it undeniably lends each\nexperience with a feeling of passion\nand of uniqueness, of being present for\na life changing event , something everybody around you is just as fired up\nand desperate for as you.\nOn the whole the one place where\nReading really surpasses Pukkelpop, is\nin atmosphere. Love it or hate it, the\nBritish music fan\u2019s unswerving passion\nfor whatever genre of music has won\ntheir heart is unbeatable. Nothing gives\nyou the same feeling of having been to\na life-changingly awesome gig as being\nthere with 60,000 people all screaming\nfor more along with you.\nLess homogeneous and with far more\nhard core music fans, Reading\u2019s punters can be in some way sorted into the\npre-university set, the musos, the rockers and the festival diehards. Indeed,\nthe festival was packed as ever and full\nof kids who don\u2019t look old enough to\nget into most gigs, mostly just fresh\nform GCSEs or A-levels and absolutely\nready for the action and the next big\nthing. Musically, this means they were\nall trying to get into the Carling Stage\nwhen Kate Nash played, and it was so\nfull you could hardly see the stage, let\nalone get within 50 feet of the tent. Tea\ncloth scarf wearing boys swung from\nthe tent ropes vying for a better look\nand groups of girls in threes giggled\nand waved the flags that had been stra-Raise your hands if you can see the sun\n\u201cBands that\nwere good at\nPukkelpop blew\nyour mind at\nReading\u201d\ntegically left around. The mood was\nhappy and like most of her songs, tri-umphant. It\u2019s a slice of \u2018the kid\u2019s\u2019 world,\nbut it was not thankfully, the main vibe\nand trend permeating the festival\nBands that had been good at Pukkelpop just blew your mind at Reading.\nNine Inch Nails were tremendous and\nthe Pumpkins set and light show was a\nreal spectacle. The artists feed off the\ncrowd and that in itself helps make\nthe shows so good. This year Reading did it\u2019s best to be as music forward\nas possible and featured a new stage,\nThe Alternative Stage, which took\nover the Comedy Tent on the Saturday night from about 7pm. The Stage\nwas curated by Transgressive Records,\na small yet mighty force in new indie\nmusic right now. Bands from their label as well as peers in the audio visual\nworld gave the modest but eager crowd\nwho made it over a feast for the eyes\nand ears. Jeremy Warmsley, Battle and\nplayed with Three Caged Tigers being\na top highlight of the evening. Reading Festival will always have a place in\nmy heart as it took my festival virginity\nand has delivered me some of the most\nrocking moments in my band loving\nand gig watching life. Pukkelpop was\na fantastic voyage into a world of super awesome festival sound and clean\ncamping. But the dirt and the grime\nand the down right rock and roll wins\nevery time...

It\u2019s a\ntrue revival, and it has already started before term\nhas even begun. We\u2019ve\nspent the summer organising amazing\nevents, busting a gut to get sponsorship for them, and worrying the other\nfaculty unions.\nEvents\nComing up in only a couple of weeks\nis the first Engineers\u2019 Bar Night of the\nyear, with free beer for engineers for\nas long as it lasts! It\u2019ll be from 6pm in\nthe Union Bar (on the East side of the\nUnion) and there will be ale and lager\nfor all.\nOn Saturday 27th October will be the\nCGCU Centennial Celebration Dinner.\nIn the marquee on Queen\u2019s Lawn, with\na three course meal, drinks and coffee\nincluded in the ticket price, as well as\na late night bar, music and dancing,\nit\u2019ll be a blowout party and not just for\nfreshers.\nTickets prices are only \u00a325 for engineers (\u00a330 for everyone else) and we\u2019ve\nsubsidised it heavily for a really great\nnight. Professor Mike Kelly (Chief Scientific Advisor to the government) will\nbe our guest speaker. At the moment,\ntickets are by email from dinner@cgcu.\nnet or at our office on Level 3 Mechanical Engineering. Soon we\u2019ll have stands\nup around college so you can buy them\nduring lunch.\nFreshers\nI should say the trwaditional welcome\nto freshers, and congratulations on\nchoosing the best technical college\nin the UK. You should pretty early on\nget their City and Guilds Wristbands.\nThese aren\u2019t just freebies to let you\nknow what union you\u2019re in; they\u2019re\ngoing to be tickets to special fresh-ers events like bar nights and cinema\nnights all through the year. Keep them!\nWear them with pride and let those\naround you know that you\u2019re an Engineer. Remember, it\u2019s the largest faculty,\nwith the longest hours \u2013 but we get the\nbest results!\nMascots\nThey said mascotry was dead, but we\nat City and Guilds know that it was\njust sleeping. We\u2019ve been busy annoying the other faculty unions over the\nsummer by nabbing their mascots, as\nyou\u2019ll see from the news pages. As well\nas our very own Spanner and Bolt, we\nare currently in possession of Davey\nthe Davy Lamp (RSM) and two out of\nfour parts of Theta the Thermometer\n(RSCU). We\u2019re working on the other\nhalf of Theta but it might take a while.\nCombined ransom money (if they\nmanage to pay up) will raise up to \u00a3600\nfor RAG charities.\nElections\nSoon we will be opening nominations\nfor our unfilled positions. If you feel\nlike standing for your Departmental\nsociety\u2019s position, or would like to be\nHonorary Secretary, RAG co-ordina-tor, or any other of the positions available on CGCU exec, please contact me\nat president@cgcu.net. Whether or\nnot you want to stand, you should have\na vote when the time comes! Keep your\neyes out for posters and other information sources.\nOur plans don\u2019t end here. We\u2019ve managed to accrue enough money to put\non some stunning events for the rest\nof the year, but we just haven\u2019t decided\nwhat yet! A lot of our annual events\nare going to be bigger and better than\nbefore \u2013 for instance, the Egg Race, a\nsmall event for the last few years, is going to have some exciting prizes and be\non a larger scale than it has been for a\ndecade \u2013 it should be a real engineering challenge.\nTristan Sherliker\nPresident\nCity & Guilds\nCollege Union\nTristan Sherliker (second from left) and his Guilds minions\nxkcd.com\nxkcd\n\n"
