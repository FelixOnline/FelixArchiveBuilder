Just before half time Brooks was\nwarned by the referee to stop\narguing. The I.C. attack were\nhaving no luck either at the\nend against a strong tackling\nI.F. defence.

It just\nseemed like a bad dream being brought back to mind by\nthe sight of the collapsing\nbuildings and withered connecting roads, shrivelled to\nwinding paths. I was taking\nLeper on a guided tour of\nthe ruins of Imperial College,\na place I grew up in.\n'Where did you spend your\ntime?' he asked, 'Did you\nlive here?'\nI nodded. You could see\nthe halls through the gap in\nthe houses where the Maths\nannexe had gradually rotted\naway leaving an untidy hole\nby the side of the road. We\nwalked that way.\n'The halls are the few of\nthe college buildings which\nhave been kept up in any\nway', I said. ' A tribute to the\narchitects and college plan-ne rs,I suppose.' As we\nstrolled closer we could\njust make out the shapes of\nthe animals pacing behind\nthe bars where I remembered\nthere had once been windows.\nT can't remember when they\nwere converted into a zoo, if\nconverted is the right word.'\nWe didn't go too near but\nI described what the Maths\nAnnexe was like and pointed\nout the bomb crater where\nits big brother the Huxley\nBuilding had been.\n'It was the only way to get\nrid of it,' I explained.\nLeper was fascinated by\nthe ghost like, menacing air\nof the festering ruins.\n'You honestly spent 3\nyears among these?', he\nasked me, incredulously.\n'That's what I'm trying to\nexplain', I said, almost\nlaughing; it was long enough\nago to be nothing much but\nvaguely funny now. 'It was\na creeping anaesthesia which\nslowly burned away most of\nthe part of your mind that\ncared, and changed the way\nwe were. You have to have\nexperienced it to appreciate\nit.'\nLeper shook his head,\nwondering ly. 'Three years',\nhe whispered to himself\nagain.\n'Well, two and a half to\nbe honest. The Authorities\nisolated me for my last six\nmonths here because I was\nhaving a bad effect on the\nother students. It had something to do with the way I kept screaming and frothing\nat the mouth while I was\nwandering around the col-le ge.'I smiled ruefully.\nI took my companion\nround to where the Queen's Tower had once stood proud\nand useless, but now slumped\nlimply with its top almost\ntouching the ground, not\nnearly so proud but equally\nuseless. While we were there\nI showed him the large pool\nof solidified glass which glistened nearby.\n'Chain's palace,' I told\nhim, 'until it melted.'\nWe had met no one on our\ntravels; in the distance you\ncould just hear the sounds\nof London carrying on as\nnormal some safe distance\nfrom the diseased spot.\nFrom there we wandered\nnorthwards, skirting piles of\nrubble where College Block\nhad been. I talked about the\nchanges that the College\nsociety had inflicted unobtrusively but inexorably upon\nits victims, without realising\nthe mortal damage it was\ncausing to itself in reaction.\nSoon we stood by the empty\nshell of the Physics building.\nT think it was in the\nPhysics and Maths Departments that the rot in the college itself first began to\nshow.' I remarked. 'The College administration became\nterribly overworked trying to\nmake everything go like\nclockwork, and weren't always able to wind up all\nthe lectures every morning.\nSome of the staff started acting human and the system\nbegan to fall apart slowly but\nobviously. Student intake\ndropped and the college\ndisease started to manifest\nitself in the buildings. You\ncan see how far it has gone\nnow'. The smell from the decaying Union building was\nbecoming unbearable so we\ndecided to call it a day.\nAlong past the charred\nskeleton of Chem. and Aero.\nEng. we walked, further by\nthe twisted and convoluted\nstone sculpture the R.S. M. had turned into, ghastly and\nimmovable, past that we\nwalked, heading back to civil-is ation. Leper was still entranced\nby his view of the mo under ing campus, incredulous that\npeople could ever have lived\nand worked there.\n'But didn't anyone care?\nAnyone?' he kept asking.\n'Oh yes, some people\ncared, but you had to find\nthem. And they were few and\nfar between, for the whole\npurpose of the place was to\nstop you caring. Stop you\nfeeling anything but dead.\nWhen the area was finally declared a disaster area almost\nhalf the population had to be\nput to sleep as the only merciful solution to the way they\nwere.'\nLeper said no more, but\nwalked deep in thought. I looked ahead. In the distance the boundary wall was\nvisible, and with it the decontamination zone coming\nslowly nearer.\nWOOFF 71\nExpedition to the\nWoolwich Free Ferry11 a.m. saw seven intrepid\nexplorers set off in two cars\nto The Prospect of Whitby,\nvia Waitrose for essential\nfodder, and thence to the\nWoolwich Free Ferry. Despite the second car being\nshaken off in some drag\nracing around Buck House\narrival was beautifully syn-chron is ed. Once on the ferry we distributed apples and cheese\nand had a picnic. Despite\nAndy Hinchcliff being called\na skinhead by some gypsies\na good time was had by all.\nSadly the ferry reached the\nforeign land south of the\nriver in about a minute, so\nthe picnic was hastily adjourned to a nearby roundabout where we were amused\nby a chopper motorbike that\nwouldn't start.\nDeciding not to go to\nMelanie's flat we returned via\nthe ferry, holding a beauty\ncompetition on the way, posthaste to the Prospect where\nwe just missed closing time.\nThe expedition was then adjourned severally to the\nV&A museum, and Virgin\nRecords in Oxford St. (where\nwe found it hard to get in).\nTwo more members of the\nexpedition arrived at the\nProspect late and reluctantly\nstayed there for an hour.\nWhile in the East End we\ndecided to visit the Lamborghini agents. We were amazed to notice the sales room door unlocked, and on further inquiry, we found inside\ntwo Lambos with the keys in\nthe lock. At this point Andy\nejaculated in his jeans and\nwe later rang the garage to\nbeg a test drive in a Miura\n(without success).\nThis expedition was twice\nthe size of the soggy Neasdex\n'70. Further plans involve an\nexpedition to the disused\nBoreham Wood studios\n(Borex '71) and to Durham\nCastle (Durex '71).\nI.C SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\nConductor: JAMES STOBART\nPiano: JOHN BARSTOW\nGreat Hall, l.C.

CULTURE COLUMN Dram soc Melodrama is a style of entertainment rarely seen in college\nsurroundings, and this is the first time that the well-known\nVictorian classic, 'The Murder of Maria Marten', has ever\nbeen performed at I.C. The play is in fact an adaptation of a true story; the main\nevents took place in Polstead, Suffolk in 1827. William\nCorder, the son of a country squire, seduced a local village\ngirl (Maria Marten), and later murdered her and secreted\nher body to avoid scandal and to save his reputation. Maria's mother experienced recurring dreams after the death in which\nshe saw the murder taking place, and as a result William\nCorder was eventually brought to justice and hanged in 1828\nat Bury Gaol. His fame grew; his naked body was exhibited\nto the public for some days after the hanging, and many\nyoung ladies queued to see it (he was apparently very well\nendowed) and afterwards it was flayed and his skin used to\nbind the books in which his trial was recorded.\nThis term's cast is drawn from the cream of the Society's acting talent, starring the President as the arch-villain, and\nthe Vice-President as the female counter villain, as well as\na number of exceedingly sweet and innocent young actresses\n(and actors) portraying the equally sweet and innocent\npeasantry. Performances will be on 16th to 19th of March.\nVerbal contributions from the audience encouraged.\nNo News Nobody at the Victoria & Albert and Science Museums\nseemed to know anything about the timing and scope of the\nimpending museum charges, which made the latest FELIX\nPROBE a bit of a flop. However, as part of the stand-on-your-own-two-feet campaign there's no reason to believe that\nwe students will get away without paying, so take a look now\nwhile you can afford it.\nThe V&A flogs some excellent brass rubbing reproductions for the mere cost of a FELIX, whilst its special exhibition (which costs) of costumes from the BBC Henry VIII\nseries seems to be drawing enormous crowds (to the satisfaction of the alleged Minister for the Arts, no doubt). However there's a free exhibition of furniture and woodwork at\nthe moment, and the superb permanent collection of antique\nmusical instruments is fascinating. Unfortunately the juke\nbox available to illustrate the instruments is out of order at\npresent.\nGalleries Currently running in London are two art exhibitions with\nmore than the usual amount of curiosity value. At the Tate\n(students admission 15p), is a collection of works by Andy\nWarhol, one of the pioneers of Pop Art (1961 onwards). His\ntechnique relies heavily on the use of multiple images, made\npossible by the screen-printing process. A painting might\nconsist of the same image\u2014a flower, portrait of Marilyn\nMonroe, a car crash scene, etc., repeated in horizontal rows\nacross the canvas, using different colours for each image.\nPerhaps the most famous Warhols are the Campbells' soup\ncans, of which the exhibition contains a whole roomful. Also\non show is his equally notorious pile of 100 Brillo boxes,\nwhich are, in actual fact, screen-printed blocks of wood.\nUnfortunately, Warhol's pioneering work now seems somewhat tame in an age when Pop Art is commonplace.\nAt the Hayward Gallery, in contrast, is the Arts Council\nexhibition \"Art in Revolution\", which gives an insight into\nartistic goings-on in Russia in the period following the Bolshevik revolution. This was a time when it seemed that\ncommunism and freedom of expression could exist side-by-side, a hope which is now shattered by present Soviet and\nChinese policies. The exhibition covers a very wide range\nof disciplines from propaganda films to stage design to architecture\u2014art in the narrow sense of paintings and sculpture\ncomprises only a minor portion. Entrance is again 15p if you\ntake your students card, and well worth the effort if you\nhave a taste for the unusual. Indeed, the layout of the exhibits is almost a work of art in itself.\nRevue22 February was the occasion of the Holbein Student\nHouse dinner, held in the Union. As an after-dinner enter-tain ment, the residents, led by Kevin Schofield, organised a revue in the upper re fec. Everyone was invited to this effort\nat a nominal cost of 5p, but very few people turned up, perhaps because the excellent posters were all nicked.\nFor an almost off-the-cuff production, the standard of the\nitems was very high, with a liberal dose of quick-fire humour\n(clean!) and a film made entirely by the Holbeinites, led by\ntheir expert sub-warden John Osborne. Compared with the\ncombined efforts of C&G college as witnessed the previous\nweek, this revue was atri up mph for Student House Community Spirit.\n\n"

C.1st XV failed in their\neffort to retain the Gutteridge Cup when they went\ndown to QMC. On paper and\nreputation both teams\nseemed evenly matched but\nthe class of the QMC fly-half Mel Hepple who plays\nfor North Eastern Counties,\nproved too much for I.C. cover.\nThe game opened with a flash of scoring which brightened up the terrible conditions of driving snow. From\nthe kick-off, I.C. gained a line-out, 5yd s from the QMC\nline winning the ball for fly-half James to calmly drop\nhis ninth goal of the season\n3-nil up and QMC hadn't even touched the ball! Touch\nit they did, however, and, a few minutes later, their inside centre, taking a perfect\npass from Hepple, burst\nthrough to score near the\nI.C. posts. The kick failed\nbut, some time later, Hepple\nmade no mistake with a penalty kick from 30yd s. This score of 6-3 remained\nuntil half-time, the rest of\nthe half seeing I.C. defend\ngrimly for most of the time\nwith back now covering an\nenormous amount of ground.\nSwinnerton, bar racked by the\ncrowd, narrowly missed with\nthree kicks in to the wind.\nHowever, I.C. came back in\nthe last 10 mins. and seemed\nset for a good second half.\nThis was certainly the case\nfor a period of about 20\nmins. I.C. camped on the\nQMC line, both scrum-half\nHarrison and no. 8 Icely\ncoming within inches of\nscoring twice. However, since\nwe didn't, the conditions\nchanged to brilliant sun-shine, the wind dropped and\nQMC came back to score\ntheir best try.

Centre-forward Lynne Benyon raced through the middle taking the ball to the\nedge of the circle and scored\na superb goal by shooting\ninto the corner of the net.\nHowever, QMC hit back\nquickly to equalise and to\ngo one goal ahead soon\nafter. Slack marking by the\nI.C. defence let another goal\nin to make it 3\u20141 at half\ntime.\nConditions gradually worsened and the game seemed\nto lose much of its interest,\nneither side really getting on\ntop. I.C. seemed to be very\nmuch worried by the weather and did not play half\nas well as they are potentially able. QMC scored their\nlast three goals in the last\nfew minutes of play to flatter themselves.\nOn the whole, rather a sad day for I.C. sport.\nTEAM: C. Morris, J. Manfield, M. Diggens, H. Lewis, A.

In the cool and damp conditions 78 teams were\nstarted at 3 o 'clock from the traditional lam post( No. 442) on\nRotten Row. Following their un heralded arrival at lunchtime on Friday the team from Hamburg University again\nsurprised us by leading the field for the first two laps; the\nfirst time a continental team has provided such a strong\nchallenge, sadly they slipped to 13th position at the finish.\nRay Smedley took over the lead for Birmingham University who were never seriously challenged again for the\nremaining four laps. Their running time of 84 minutes 54\nsees provided a new course record. Second were Leeds University and third Borough Road College who again won the\ntrophy for the fastest small college. The fastest lap was run\nin a record time of 13 mins 27 sec by Jack Lane of\nSouthampton University who stormed past 32 other runners\non his way round! I.C. came an undistinguished 34th...

Southampton, who were superior\nin many aspects of the game\nfound it hard to penetrate\nthe I.C. defence where Simon Tyrell (still only a fresh-er) played with superb cool\nand confidence.\nThe goal came midway\nthrough the first half direct\nfrom a short corner.

In the\nlast minute of the half, Pete\nBates and Dave Richman\n(?), linked up wet for Dave\nto score his ninth goal of\nthe season.\nIn the second half I.C. continued to score freely and\nDave Wilson completed his\nhat-trick, with a fine reverse\nstick push\u2014thus bringing his\ntally to seventeen this sea-son.\nDon't forget the I.C.H.

Conditions for the race were ideal\u2014a medium\ni stream with a slight following breeze over most of the\n\"horseshoe\" shaped course.\nThe College first VIII, yet in an embryonic form, owing\nto the recent difficulties within the Club, had a disappointing row, being placed second of seventeen College eights,\nbehind U.L. II (who were not officially competing!) and\nGuys Hospital I, the Head crew.\nOnly one second behind came I.C. Ill, Head of the\nJunior Division, (I.C. Ill) easily the fastest crew in this\ndivision, and faster than many of the Open crews. This was\nan excellent row by eight determined and enthusiastic\noarsmen, all of whom learned to row at the College. All credit too to the novice crews whose performances were\nall creditable.\nOne of the difficulties the Club is trying to overcome,\nand which has been causing us a great deal of inconvenience, is the shortage of intelligent, quick thi in king, lightweights for cox es, without which the Club cannot function\nproperly.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, March 11, 1971\nELTON JOHN in concert 24th February\nTo one of the largest audiences seen in the Great Hall,\nElton John rocked his way\nthrough several really great\nnumbers. Yet he didn't arrive on stage until about\ntwenty to eleven when some\nof the audience must have\nbeen worried about his ap-pear ance. Yet appear he did,\nto a really warm reception\nfor both himself and his first,\n'Your Song.' Up until then,\nthe crowd in the Great Hall\nhad been treated to first\nUrban Clearway, and later\nJohn's backing group Hookfoot.\nUrban Clearway lacked a few things, one of them ta-lent. And they might have\nbeen more at home in one of\nEnt's 'Saturday night hops.'\nStill, perhaps this is unfair,\nthe audience did thank the\ngroup with reasonable ap-pla use. And so on to Hookfoot who gave a performance\nwhich clearly showed more\ntalent and experience. Between them, they showed not\nso much versatility as actual\ntechnique and coordination;\ntheir music was hard and\nhad a likeable amount of\nrock influence. They gained\na big response and only the\nfact that Elton John fol-lowed, limited the several\nshouts of 'more.'\nThe Concert's one fault\nwas one that must limit many\nsuch 'technical' events. Time\nbetween performances\ndragged as equipment, not\nvery extensive in this case,\nwas transferred to and from\nbackstage. It seems a pity\nthat these interruptions'\nmust happen, concerts lose\nsome continuity and atmosphere because of them.\nHence the delayed appearance of Elton John on stage.\nYet his performance made\nup for any other shortcomings, with a range of songs\nand styles, one or two from\nthe LP 'Tumbleweed Connection.' Elton John has two\nrare qualities; one his voice\nand two, his way of jumping around the piano while\nstill banging out on the\nkeys. With artists like this\nguy. Ents can't go wrong!\nFILMS\nMick Jagger to D.H. Lawrence At present showing at the\nOdeon in Kensington are\n'Sons and Lovers' and \"The\nVirgin and the Gipsy', either\none of these films would be\nwell worth spending your\n50p on seeing, and in my\nopinion this double billing\nis not to be missed.\n'Sons and.Lovers'\u2014which\nis in Black and White, is\nabout a boy from a mining\nfamily in Nottingham who\nwishes to leave and go to\nLondon, but is prevented\nfrom doing so by his love\nfor his mother. He is deeply affected by the way that\nthe love between his father\nand his mother had decayed,\nand is determined that his\nlife should not be wasted in\na similar manner.\nAlthough this film is in\nBlack and White, the camera\nwork is truly excellent in\nevery way; however, I was\nslightly irritated by the way\nsome of the 'Nottingham'\npeople spoke with pseudo-Yorkshire accents.\nThe main film of the programme was Christopher\nMiles' 'The Virgin and the\nGipsy', based on the book\nby D.H. Lawrence. The\nplot was fairly typical of\nLawrence, about two girls,\nYvette and Lucille, who return to live in a quiet village rectory having just\nfinished their schooling in\nFrance, and how particularly Yvette, played by Joanna\nShimkus, fails to settle into\nthe triviality of vicarage life.\nWhen Yvette meets 'the\nGipsy', played by Franco\nNero, she finds herself drawn\nalmost magnetically towards\nhim. The Gipsy is portrayed\nas a very strong, virile, silent\nalmost rock-like character\u2014\nin marked contrast to\nYvette's father, the Vicar.\nThe rest of the film leads up\nto the inevitable love scene\u2014\nwhich comes about in a most improbably convenient\nmanner, making the ending of\nthe film very sudden.\nThe opening few scenes introduce all the main characters in great detail, I particularly liked the way\n'Granny' (Fay Compton)\nwas portrayed, her ability to\nstart trouble and then to become stone deaf was really\nwell done. The first 'Dinner\nScene' clearly showed the\nstresses which existed within\nthe family group. Again\nthe photography in this film\nwas very good, I particularly\nliked the opening shots of\nthe church and the water-fall. D. Howard\n'Performance' (Warner,\nWest End) is the Mick Jagger film that was nearly\nnever released, according to\nreports, due to Jagger's accent being nearly incomprehensible, but after completely re-recording the soundtrack it has been finally re-leased. 'Performance' was\nmade earlier than 'Ned Kelly', which was slated by both\nthe critic is and Mick Jagger\nhimself (I personally rather\nenjoyed 'Ned Kelly', a skillfully made film). 'Perform-ance' is totally different to\n'Ned Kelly'. Jagger plays\nTurner\u2014a brooding, retired\npop-singer, who shelters\nJames Fox, the young thug\non the run from his gang.\nTurner shelters James Fox\nonly reluctantly, perhaps because Turner can see the\ngreat gap between his own\nand Fox's world.\nAt the beginning of this\nrelationship the two stay\nseparate until Fox needs Turner to take a passport photograph for him, and then Turner drugs Fox and a relationship develops on the\nrealisation that they have\nmore in common than was\nat first obvious.\nWhen Fox recovers from\nthe drugs he realises he Is\nlate in 'phoning a friend\nabout his passport, the gang\nfind out where he is and\nthey come to Turner's house\nto get Fox. Fox kills Turner\nand is then taken to the boss'\ncar, the car drives off and it\nis clearly Turner in the car.\nThe apparent change in\nidentity is again to emphasise the closeness of the relationship and their deaths\nfinally destroy this relation-ship.\nPersonally, I thought that\nthis was a very excellent\nfilm. The photography is almost subjective at times.\nThe acting from James Fox\nis superb, his portrayal of\nthe young thug was quite ter-rif ying; Mick Jagger's Turner is excellent, which in a way surprised me.\nOverall this is probably\none of the most interesting\nfilms on release at the\nmoment.\nJohn Bryan\nRECORDS\nOne British songwriter/singer who tends to be completely\nignored due to lack of publicity is Nick Drake, whose second\nLP \"Bryter Layter\" (Island 9134) has just appeared, despite a promise of Autumn '70 release on the cover of the\nsampler album \"Bumpers.\" His first record, \"Five Leaves\nLeft,\" contained work of a very high standard, but received\nno acclaim whatsoever. The new album is equally good, retaining the same atmosphere of sitting-drinking-coffee-watch-ing-the-world-through-the-window which is well known to\nmany of us. Perhaps a large part of one's musical taste consists of identification with the performer or writer, and the\nmusic of Nick Drake is the nearest I have found to my\nparticular outlook on life.\nMusically, he is a very accomplished acoustic guitarist,\nand with the help of arranger Robert Kirby he weaves behind himself some fascinating backings including a string\norchestra (excellent stereo perspective), flute, and Ray Warleigh's tenor saxophone. Although the words are an important part of the overall effect, Drake's voice does not attract all one's attention; indeed the three instrumental tracks\ngive the impression of being backing tracks over which he\ncouldn't be bothered to sing! One really \"grooving\" track is\n\"Poor Boy,\" including Pat Arnold and Doris Troy on chorus.\nIn the field of sampler LP's, Elektra have recently followed the example of CBS, Harvest and Island by issuing\na double album priced at \u00a31.49 \u2014 \"Garden of Delights.\"\nWhatever your views about collections such as this, it certainly contains some important tracks by important artists.\nThe variation is very wide indeed, from Eric Clapton and the\nIncredible String Band to one of the most hauntingly beautiful tracks ever recorded \u2014 \"Someday Soon\" by Judy\nCollins. In fact, think of an Elektra artist (Love, Paxton, etc.)\nand you will probably find a sample of his work on this\nbargain LP. Ideally one should be allowed to listen a few\ntimes to records such as this and then take them back in\npart-exchange for the half-dozen full price records which\nthey have persuaded you to buy.\nCharlie Hulme\n\n"

It is towards category (iii) that this is mainly\ndirected \u2014 before I arrived in hall I had no idea of what\nlife would be like. Everyone appears to want to live in one\nof the college residences, although perhaps for many different\nreasons. Hall politics have recently been appearing frequently\non the news pages of Felix, but this epistle is simply an attempt at a general description of the stacks of bedrooms\nwhich are second (or first) home to about a thousand of us.\nBeit: Redbrick section.\nThe oldest rivi ng quarters built for the college are the\nBeit halls in the Union building, whose rooms are in consequence very homely places, arranged along corridors in\nhotel fashion. Counting the millions of holes in the ceiling\ncertainly whiles away one's idle moments! Another feature\nof life in Beit is that it is at the moment the only hall in which\nwomen are allowed to live. Strangely enough, however, this\nputs them further away from any available bar than any\nother residents, as they are not exactly welcome in the notorious Union Bar. Living in the Union building of course\ngives one easy access to its dwindling facilities, including the\namazing all-afternoon buttery, gymnasium, press-room\n(waste-paper dept.), etc. It also places you within uncomfortably easy earshot of the Saturday hops, Jazz club practice\nroom and output from the above mentioned bar.\nGarden: Making the best of things\nNext in seniority is Garden Hall which was converted\nfrom old houses on the north side of Princes Gardens in\nthe early 1950s, and is now the most individual and progressive of all the halls, and prototype for the recently-opened\nstudent houses. Under the leadership of Dr. Hardwick and\nthe inimitable Roy Francis, watched over by the immortal\nLord Garden, this hall has progressed from a place to stay\nto a complete way of life. Rooms are regarded almost as\ncommunal places where everyone sits around drinking tea\nuntil late into the night, cementing the foundations of a true\ncommunity (!).\nOn the political side, Garden have successfully applied a system whereby anyone who turns up at a committee meeting is automatically made a temporary member, and have\nalso introduced a random selection scheme for prospective\nresidents, except re applicants. This progress has, however,\nbeen made in the face of (because of?) difficulties such as\nan abundance of double and triple rooms and the lack of\nsocial facilities. At one time Garden residents shared in the\noperation of Weeks hall bar, but this system has now been\nabandoned, although the bar is still conveniently close.\nWeeks: All Mod. Cons.\nThe first to be built of the new \"Building Block\" halls\nwas Weeks, which was paid for by Vickers Ltd. and is used\nby them as a training centre during vacations. Because of\nthis, and its having been built at a fairly prosperous time\n(1959) Weeks has bigger rooms and more lavish facilities\nthan more recent constructions. The lift, for example, although slower, stops at every floor, and the telephones are\nfitted in proper booths rather than under useless hoods. A definite strong point of Weeks Hall is the bar, which, although\nsmall, serves the cheapest and best beer in college and has\na dartboard which is the right height and properly lit (Lin-stead please note). Since acquiring their colour , television,\nthe residents have gained a reputation for in hospitality, particularly around 10 p.m. on Tuesdays, although personally I must say that I have always been made very welcome.\nNew Beit\nSouthside: Monolithic living.\nBiggest hall is Southside (or more correctly Selkirk +\nKeogh + Tizard + Falmouth), which, Mews residents not-withstanding, rests along the south side of Princes Gardens,\nenabling three distinct periods in architecture to be observed\nwithin a short distance along the same street. It/they houses\nabout 400 of us, but character and interest do not appear to\nbe proportional to size, although perhaps I am just uninformed (\"That's right\", you all reply). Living in Southside places one directly above the notorious Mooney Refectory, about\nwhich I can only say that just before writing this article I ate\na Mooney-Southside meal, and that's my excuse. Also conveniently situated is Southside Bar (Women permitted !),\nsupposedly the college's \"smooth\" drinking place . . .\nLinstead; new ideas.\nMost recently built hall of residence (1968) is Linstead,\nagain in the now familiar 'pile of matchboxes' style, but\nbuilt on a smaller budget, resulting in smaller rooms and an\ninconveniently shaped common-room area, with an enormous concrete pillar blocking the view of the TV. What sets\nLinstead apart from the other halls, however is its system of\ninclusive evening meals, Monday-Friday. Although made in\nthe Southside kitchens, these meals have often been known\nto be edible or even Good, and save one the bother of diy cooking after a tiring day of hard work at college (lifting\nall those heavy cups of coffee . . . ). Linstead also has a bar,\nwhich, unlike Weeks,' looks like a bar, although it hides\nashamedly behind yet another concrete pillar. Two residents\ncomprise the nightly staff, at a wage of 0.25 pints of beer per\nhour (before tax).\nPolitically, Linstead is also relatively progressive. A new,\nfairer, system of electing the hall committee has been in-tro duce d, and it is now legal for a male guest to sleep on\nyour floor, if he can find the space.\nStudent Houses; semi-detached.\nFinally, last but not least, etc., in this vague survey come\nthe student houses, which are converted Victorian terraces\nin Evelyn Gardens, somewhere down the Brompton Road.\nThe venture was initiated by the union a few years ago, the\nintention being to provide, at a cheaper rate, accommodation\nsimilar to the bed-sitters in which many students reside. In\naddition, they are now beginning, due to the efforts of enthusiastic committees and wardens, to develop a spirit of\ntheir own. Although most rooms are shared, it is often\npossible to choose your room-mate, and there is, in at least\none of the houses, a highly flexible overnight guest system. If\nyou fancy painting a mural on the common-room wall, or\nwould like to live in a place slightly detached from the hurl y burly of the college campus (with megaphone ac com pani ment) then life in student house may well be your cup of\ntea/coffee.\nFinale.\nSuch, then, are the halls and houses. Living here will allow\nyou to take advantage of the many cheap social activities,\nand make a lot of (too many?) friends. The zero travelling\ntime will of course allow you to do more work. An obvious\ndisadvantage, though, is the social isolation. How many\npeople who are not science students do you meet in a place\nlike this? \u2014 very few, unless you actually go out of your\nway to do so. Another disadvantage, its severity depending\non your own tolerance, is the incidence of unusual disruptions, such as nocturnal chants of \"Chem-eng three,\" sounds\nof smashing glass, etc. Indeed, I was once menaced by an\nunfriendly gorilla at 1 a.m. on Linstead upper gallery . . .\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, MARCH11,1971 EX-POLICEMAN\nAIDS BURSAR\nA disabled messenger in\nI.C. has been forced by the\ncollege to remain on permanent early shift (6.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.). The messen-ger, feeling entitled to have\nsome turns on the later shift\n9 a.m. to 6 p.m.) made a request to the establishment\noffice and gave details of his\ntravelling difficulties. The\nmessenger is a polio victim\nand wears an iron caliper on\nhis leg. This fact and the unreliability of public transport makes it necessary for\nhim to rise at 5 a.m. every\nday, and even then he might\nreach college late.\nThe request was looked\ninto by the College and then\nconsidered by the College's Messengers and Security\nGuards Consultative Committee. Mr. Seaford, the Bursar, is chairman of the committee which is a bit like\n\"JURGO\" used to be. On\nthe consultative committee\n\u2014 annoyingly it was reported to Mr. Seaford by the\nhead messenger Mr. Basshorn \u2014 an ex-police detective sergeant \u2014 that he had\n'proceeded' to the address of\nthe messenger concerned and\npaced the distance from his\nhouse to the bus-stop; then\nchecked the early bus and\ntrain times and calculated\nthat the disabled messenger\nhad 'no valid reason for\nwishing to change his working hours.'\nOne would think that London Transport alone would\nprovide a reason for fair\ntreatment \u2014 but no! The\nmovements of a disabled\nman who asks for fair treatment are subjected to detective style investigations.\nIf members of the College\nauthorities have time to\nspare undertaking such inhuman acts they should be\nsacked !\nLord Penney, IC Union,\nICNUPE, Presidential candidates what are you doing?\n300this su eYes! This really is is the 3 0 0 th issue\nof FELIX, you are reading. For revelation s of how our paper was in the past see page 5\nSILLY ASSAS\nCertain residents in South\nSide were thought to be distinctly embarrassed by a series of posters which appeared\novernight last Friday advertising an alleged YEUKSOC presentation, namely\n\"THE KEYSTONE LOCKSMITHS,\" the stars of\nwhich you can probably\nguess, so we won't bother to\nname names. (In any case,\nthe next issue of PRIVATE\nI.C. will probably tell you).\nAn agile collection of critical\ncomments such as \"The key\nto all your problems\" (Brass-workers Weekly), \"What\nbrilliant acting\" (I.C. Maintainance) (their bad spelling,\nnot ours), \"Watch this pair\"\n(Head of C.I.D.) and \"It's on\nthe level, Bugsie\" (The\nQuality Street Gang) added\nfurther amusement. Regrettably, few people saw the\nnotice, which was at one\ntime displayed on every\nlanding in South Side, due to\ncertain residents of South\nSide hurriedly removing\nthem to avoid further embarrassment to themselves.\nSENNET STOLEN\nPIERS COMMENTS Last week some I.C. stu-dents, acquaintances of Mr.\nSteve Cooke, stole about\n1000 copies of SENNET\n(which had been delivered\none day late) from the Union Office. I realise that the\npersons concerned probably\ndisagree with many opinions\nexpressed in SENNET, but\nI do not feel that this justifies them preventing the\ngreat mass of I.C. students\nfrom reading such views \u2014\nwe can all make up our own\nminds !\nI, and my friends, have\nnever prevented literature of\nright wing op in on( eg; the\nBroadsheets, Private I.C.) being circulated or disturbed.\nWe believe that there must\nalways be free discussion \u2014\nwithout it people will never\nbe able to form their own\nideas.\nWe find the actions of\nthose persons reprehensible;\nI am the more concerned because many people who have\ntaken exception to some\npoints in previous issues of\nSENNET found this issue\n\"much better,\" yet it is being denied from most students (unless I can get hold\nof more copies at the expense of other students else-where).\nThis is not the first time\nin I.C. that persons on the\nextreme right have done this\nsort of thing. Two years ago\nsuch persons stole posters,\npublicity and petitions which\nwere part of the campaign to\nchange the Union's Constitution; one year ago such\npersons tried to beat me up;\nmore recently they have\nbeen manhandling women of\ndifferent, yet perfectly valid,\npolitical views out of I.C. Union and South Side bars;\nand most recently they\nforced a friend of mine\n(Ricardo) into the Round\nPond because they didn't agree with him.\nWe cannot sit back and allow these ugly tendencies to\noperate as a sort of \"vigilante squad.\" The situation\nis serious \u2014 that is why\nRicardo decided to take two\nof the persons who helped\ndrag him to the Pond to\ncourt; but this is not\nenough \u2014 we must all be on\nour guard.\nI have asked the Deputy\nPresident to do what he can\ntil?.......... if to bring the students who\nstole the copies of SENNET\nbefore Council for disciplinary action. As I understand it, these people have\nbeen stealing Union proper-ty, since SENNET is distributed under the auspices\nof I. C.U.I hope that anyone\nwho knows anything about\nthe matter will inform Tony\nKirkham, and that anyone\nwho has any influence over\nMr. Cooke will point out to\nhim that if he is a responsible member of Council he\nwill say who stole the\nSENNETS\u2014he admits that\nhe knows, but refuses to tell.\nYours,\nPiers Coroyn,\nEditor of SENNET.\nNews In Brief\nFELIX wonders why the\nnew, and very welcome, PRIVATE I.C. contains so many\nreferences to Dennis \"3\narrests\" Taylor and Steve\n\"Capitalism works\" Cooke.\nThe latter is described in the\norgan as \"infamous\" and\n\"well known head of Gestapo at I.C.\" and is thought\nto condone stealing copies of\nSENNET and a little healthy\nqueer-bashing. Messrs. (in-deed) Taylor and Cooke,\nwhilst peddling copies last\nweek, strenuously denied any\nconnection with the organ.\nIf this is really yet another\nego-trip medium, it seems to\nbe rather a costly one. Evidently the disposal of 2000\ncopies is proving more difficult than anticipated, and\nheavy losses will have to be\nborne personally by the\nbackers' overdrafts.\nRumours that there are\nno women available for the\nCarnival Computer Dating\nScheme are categorically de-nie d.A park bench still serves\nas a useful adjunct to the\nseating available in Falmouth Hall.\nThe Chairman of the Conservative Society is rumoured\nto have declined to speak in\nthe recent debate concerning\nwhether or not socialism is\na worthless dream.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX 11th March, 1971\nELECTION CANDIDATES John McCullough\nGraham Oubridge\nPresidential Candidate]\nPresidential Candidate\nJohn is at present a third year Geology student and a floor rep. on ICU Council.\nHe has seen a wide spectrum of ICU and IC whilst being\nactive in Academic Affairs, Accommodation, Refectories,\nExternal affairs and Carnival.\nHe is standing for President because he wants to do the\njob and also because he knows he can do it in such a way\nas to give the greatest possible benefit to the union.\nThe job of President, he sees as one of leading and coordinating all Union officials in their attempt to serve, and\nmake, a stronger ICU. The President now has the time\nespecially if prepared to delegate responsibility, to direct\nhis not inconsiderable influence into pressing forward strongly\non a certain number of fronts and hopefully to achieve\ngreater progress for the benefit of ICU.\nAs President of ICU, he hopes to fulfil one major aim,\nfrom which he sees all detailed aims will automatically\nfollow. This is the aim to see a more organised form of\npolicy-making and policy-fulfilling within ICU. As integral\nparts of this scheme he would like to see firstly, at the\nstart of each term, meetings of a nine or ten man executive\nbody from ICU Council who would decide in which areas\nprogress is most needed within ICU e.g. refectories, representation, state of the union building, etc. This body would\nthen present its reasons for its priority list to Council and\nthe union early on and then try to formulate a policy for\nTHE VITAL QUESTION\nBy the time you read this the campaign for I.C. Union\nPresident will be well under way. If you have read the\nbump h sheets scattered around the College you should now\nhave a pretty good idea of the policies of the candidates.\nMany of these policies you may well have seen before,\nsome may be quite new. Either way you may now be asking\n'Who will be the best man to achieve these things?'\nAlthough it is often thought taboo to mention personality\nin an election, and I would be the last to want the campaign\nto become a slang ing match, I do believe that there are\ncertain personal qualities which a successful President must\npossess. Every President has a different personality and\nhence a different approach, and it is the approach as much\nas the policies which is likely to determine the achievements\nof any President.\nOne essential quality is the ability to bring out the best\nin the people he works with. To achieve anything the Union\nas a whole and Council in particular must work as a team,\nand one of the biggest parts of the President's job is to get\nthis team running smoothly and effectively. The President\nyou elect must be someone approachable, someone you can\ntrust, and someone you would go out of your way to do a favour for.\nAnother vital attribute is the ability to take the broad\nview. All the Union policies are intrinsically linked and if\nthey are to work they must be seen as a whole. We can\nnever get diversification without the necessary degree of\nrepresentation.\nRepresentation on College committees cannot achieve\nvery much without students having an effective voice in the\ndepartments. No representation will work in your interests\nPete Lambert\nPresidential Candidate\nOur candidate stands on a platform to defeat the Tory\nGovernment and force it to resign. No-one should underestimate this right wing Tory Government, representing a clique of Landlords, Bankers and Monopolists. Since their\nelection last June the Tories have hit out at all the basic\nrights of students and workers \u2014 wages, jobs, education, food\nprices, cheap council housing, the National Health Service,\nand Academic Freedom. They aim to \"Change the course\nof History\" (Heath quote) and bring in a new form of\ndictatorship with unions chained to the state.\nDriven by the ever deepening crisis of the capitalist system,\nsoaring inflation, sharpening trade war and huge bankruptcies \u2014 like Rolls Royce, Vehicle & General Insurance Co.,\nand possibly Concorde, the Tory Government is determined\nto drive the Working class back to the conditions of the\n1930's. At the hub of the Tories' attack is their legislation against\nthe rights of the Trade Unions and shop floor built up\nthrough 200 years of hard struggle. The Industrial Relations\nBill and the Immigration Bill can and must be defeated. But\nthis means defeating the Tory Government. This Immigration Bill is designed to encourage the racialist attacks on im-t ages of this he sees as, firstly, the initiation of action very\nearly on, and secondly the combining of the major spheres\nof influence within the union e.g., I.C.U. officers, C.C. U's. Clubs committees, etc., to arrive at such decisions as one,\nfully unified, body.\nHe believes we can only strengthen the union by combining\nall factions within it, instead of trying to ignore and thus\nan tag on is e certain factions, a disastrous policy that leaves\nsuch obvious open rifts in I.C.U. that the college admin, can\ntry and turn to their advantage.\nComplementary to the above he would like to see union\nmeetings being less of a chair reporting session to the union\nbody, but more of a meeting where council presents its policy\nideas to the union and receives comments and a mandate\nfrom the union on those ideas.\nAlso he believes I.C.U. can play a fuller role within N.U.S. especially in using N.U.S. as a contact with other unions\nand thus in the tapping of the Nationwide Student experience\nin dealing with the many important problems specifically\nrelevant to students, e.g. Student Representation, Student\nRefectories, etc.\nAnd so, through teamwork and a positive sense of dire c tion, John believes we can successfully carry out the policies\noutlined above, thus furthering the cause of I.C.U., that of\nserving its members as is best possible.\nJohn would like the chance to lead the attempt.\nChris Holden,\nProposer.\nif only Council is represented, and there is a lack of communication with the ordinary Union member. Similarly\nthroughout the fields of welfare, academic and external\naffairs no one policy can work in isolation. The President\nmust have the vision to see the picture as a whole and hence\ndeploy his forces in the most effective manner to fulfil his\nand the Union's aims.\nThere are many other essential qualities to make a good\nPresident. He must be perceptive and responsive to the needs\nof the Union members, and ensure that the Union is never\nout of touch with its membership. He must be capable of\ndogged determination in sticking to his aims and principles,\nbut he must combine this with a necessary degree of flexibility to achieve results. He must be vigilant in seeing that\nthe advances we have made are not undermined by arbitrary\ndecisions by-passing committees, and he must be energetic\nin pursuing the objectives still to be gained. His basic concern at all times must be the interests of you, the people he\nrepresents.\nI hope that you have seen the policy statements which I have issued and will continue to issue, and 1 hope you will\nconsider both these and the basic issue of who is best suited\nto lead the Union next year, before placing your vote on\nMonday or Tuesday. If you have any questions about the\ncampaign I will be pleased to answer them at the hustings\nor in the J. C.R., College Block on Friday. If you live in\nstudent house or hall and I 've not yet visited you, I hope\nto do so in the next couple of days. My first priority during\nthis campaign has been and continues to be meeting as\nmany of you as possible so that you may judge for yourselves how well I am suited for the job of I.C. Union\nPresident.\nmigrant workers in order to split the working class with\nracial is m. The whole bloodstained history of British Imperialism and\nthe brutal methods used in N. Ireland today should warn us\nthat the British ruling class will not hesitate to turn to\nFascism when necessary. The march of 200,000 Trade Unionists through London on Sunday 21st February in defence\nof the Unions was the biggest march since the ch artist movement of the last century, and the resolute fight of the postmen and Ford workers shows the determination of the working class to defend their rights in contrast to the betrayals of\ntheir reformist leadership.\nMillions of other workers and sections of the middle class\nstand behind them. Cleared of their reformist leadership a whole revolutionary struggle of the working class can burst\nforward. Student plights are not separate from those of the\nworking class. The capitalist class in crisis cannot allow\n\"free speech\" for Dutschke any more than they can afford\nto increase grants, or expand higher education.\nWe must take up our stand with the working class. All those who preach reformation of the system like the Stalinists mis-lead students and betray their interests. We must\nbuild as mass Young Socialists to lead the Working Class\nforward. This is why we call on all those students, who wish\nto fight to bring down this Tory Government and fight for\nSocialism, to come to the Young Socialists' 11th Annual\nConference at Scarborough on the 3rd and 4th April.\n\n"

To\nanswer this question we\nmust throw light on some of\nthe often forgotten issues in-vol ved, bearing in mind the\npresent system has evolved\nduring several ages of educational thought and hence\nneeds rational ising. The opinion that a student\nhas been provided with a university education out of\nthe goodness of society's heart is we believe the first\nand most basic misc once p tion. This country provides\nus with an education because it requires us to be\neducated in order to fulfill\nthe needs of society, and\ntherefore we owe nothing to\nsociety.\nBearing this in mind\nwhen we consider a student's standard of living, we should\nnot consider it in the context of a student's life \u2014 one\nof books, tatty digs, basic\nfood and spending money\nbut in comparison with the\nexpectations of a person of\ns imu lar age in other E MPLOYMENT.\nThe only consideration\nopposing this was voiced by\na single IC student a few\ndays ago in saying what\nresponsibility does a student\nhave to society, and is the\nsystem we live in ie. self supporting capitalism. I would\nsay the individual is helpless\nbut to accept society's handouts.\nHaving decided the stu-dent's grant system should\nbe reviewed NUS has arrived\nwith a number of priorities\nat revisions.\n(1) The removal of the\ndiscretionary grant system\nunder which only students\non degree equivalent courses\nare entitled to a grant by\nright. Thus HND students\nare awarded grants at the\nwhim of their LEA. Thus\ngreat discrepancies arise in\nthe size of the award from\none LEA to another and\nwithin an LEA.\nhall selection\n\u2014a personal view by Steve^Swailes\nWith some interest being\nshown amongst both students\nand administration bureaucracies in the revision of Hall\nselection procedures, it is\ntime for a careful look at the\ncriteria upon which this\nselection is based.\nFirstly let us consider the\nsituation as it stands. Freshers appear as if by Divine\nDecree from deep within the\nbowels of the Departments;\nplaces are filled by the Union, wardens, and finally\nre applicants and new 2nd year, 3rd year and PG applicants by courtesy of the\nmuch loved Hall committees.\nIt is in these Hall committee\nallocated places that justice\nis least seen to be done. On\nwhat criteria are these\nplaces awarded, and what\nright have the Hall committees to exercise those cri-teri a? Generally speaking, places\nare awarded by the committees on the basis of potential\nusefulness of applicants to\nthe Hall, or, in the case of\nre-applicants, what they did\nfor the Hall whilst in residence. This amounts to little\nless than social apartheid.\nWhat right has a small group\nof Hall residents \u2014 in one\ncase, Weeks, elected by themselves in advance of their\nterm of office \u2014 to say that\nover-social is ed extroverts\nwho function in a very narrow sphere of influence are\nmore entitled to a place in\nHall than introverts or\npeople whose sphere is wider\nthan the purely local? The\nonly criteria for a place in\nHall should be membership\nof Imperial College and the\nhuman race \u2014 perhaps an\nimpossible combination. Of\ncourse a cheap room, hot\nwater, showers, baths, inedible food and ridiculous rules\nshould be available to all\nmembers of the College regardless of personality.\nStarting with this criterion\nand the principle that every\nundergraduate should have\nthe offer of one year in Hall,\nthere are several fields where\nradical pruning would not\ncome amiss. Firstly are re-admissions necessary at all?\nThe tired old answer which\nstaggers forth traditionally is\nthat re-admissions are necessary to preserve the continuity of Hall life, or, if you\nlike, the sterility of Hall life.\nYear in, year out, the same\nghastly parties and coffee\nswilling sessions, and the\nsame cant about overnight\nguests \u2014 without any re-admissions a few new ideas\nmight well up out of the\ngreat stagnant pool of festering old thought that exists\nat present.\nThen the Union places.\n(2) The concurrent abolition of the means test with\nincome tax allowances and\nfamily allowances for stu-dents. And while the bureaucratic changes required implementing this are con-side red, NUS suggest a complete revision of the scales\non which the parental means\nare judged.\nThe reasons for NUS giving this measure a high\npriority are involved in the\ndifficulties in family relationships and finances coursed\nby the present system quite\napart from the fact that a student cannot possibly exist\non a grant unless made up\nto the full figure which many\nparents have to ask their\nsons and daughters to do.\n(3) A restoration of the\nreal value of the grant compared with an estimation of\na students cost of living\nindex increase since 1962. By\nincreasing the rate of the\nmaximum mandatory grant\naccordingly.\nThe NUS has set up a publicity campaign to try and\ninfluence the government on\na national scale and the\nLEAs on the local (college\nand area) scale, as well as\nobtaining the sympathy of\nthe public in general.\nThe sign finance of the\nlocal level of influence is\nfar greater than is usual due\nto the integral part played\nby the LEA in supplying\ngrants, some of the finance\nfor which comes from the\nlocal rates.\nHow does IC come into this\ncampaign? Despite the lack of\nvolunteers coming forward at\nthe previous union meeting, as\norganising committee for the\ncampaign has been set up and\nare in close liaison with the\nUSK grants committee.\nAs you should have noticed\na certain number of leaflets\nand posters have been circulated in college. On Tuesday a write-in to MPs was held and\nit is hoped to hold several more\nin the College block JCR. It is\nalso expected that a sizeable\npress report on grants will appear in this week's Kensington\nPost due to the work of the\nUSK committee.\nIt is intended that a petition\nshowing the support of academic staff will be handed to\nMrs. Thatcher in a few days\ntime.\nThe other main activity is not\nWe hope going to consist of putting our views over at local\nclubs such as the const it u al Conservative party, Rotarys and\nround tables in the hope that\nwe will be able to secure the\nsympathy of influential citizens\nor alternatively that these local\nbranches may pass sympathetic\nmotions to be communicated to\ntheir regional or national offices.\nIn this campaign we obviously\nneed active support and anybody interested in helping\nshould contact Greg Burland\n(Physics 1) or via the Union\nOffice.\nIt would be helpful for future\ngrants campaigns if you were\nto fill in the relevant questionnaire about to be circulated by\nthe welfare committee.\nDear Sir,\nI Would like to complain about the low standard, cheap\nand smutty photographs that have recently appeared in\nFELIX (e.g. above).\nYour faithfully,\nL.T.

A first\nyear in Hall introduces\nFreshers more directly and\npositively to College life,\nother students, and them-selves, than a year spent in\ndistant suburbia. 50% of\nresidents should be Freshers.\nThe time has come to radically rethink the whole selection procedure for Halls of\nResidence on both moral and\npractical grounds \u2014 most of\nour lives are controlled by\nothers already \u2014 they claim\nto speak for the People \u2014\nyou are a Person, and only\nyou can speak for YOU.\nB.
