    "content": "Feature\nOurselves alone\nThe 'Irish Problem' has a long and convoluted history, stretching back\nto before the Norman Conquest. The events and politics that have shaped\nIreland are explained by Adam Harrington, who also offers his own views\non this troubled country.\nIn this article, I do not propose a solution. In fact, I propose that there\nis no solution. Any answer to the\nIrish problem lies with the Irish\npeople themselves, although I believe that as Northern Ireland is\na part of the United Kingdom,\nmainland Britain cannot wash its\nhands of the problem.\nIreland, along with Wales and\nScotland, was the lost retreat\nwestwards of the Celts from the\nAnglo-Saxon invaders. There was\nalways a certain hostility towards\nthe English. By 1500, only a small\narea around Dublin, comprising\nfour counties called 'the Pale', could\nbe considered to be under secure\nEnglish control. The phrase 'beyond\nthe pale' comes from this.\nUlster, an area extending beyond\nthe limits of modern Northern\nIreland, had always been the most\nfractious part of the island. In order\nto subdue the native Irish, ensure a British presence in Ireland and to\nmake sure the official State Church\nof Ireland, which was Anglican, had\ncongregations, many hundreds of\nScottish Protestants were\nencouraged to settle in the North of\nIreland. They were given land and\nthe accompanying landowner's rights. Those who already owned\nthe land were removed in an\nastonishingly nifty legal move.\nNative Irish Roman Catholics were\ndisplaced and became merely\ntenants. It is ironic that the Scottish\nsettlers were of the same ancestry as\nthe Irish they displaced. Also\naround this time, the early part of\nthe seventeenth century, the town\nof Derry was granted to the City of\nLondon.\nThis Protestant plantation was so\nsuccessful at subduing the native\npopulation that it was repeated\nelsewhere in the world. Though\nRoman Catholics were increasingly\nexcluded from positions of power\nwithin the state and judiciary, there\nfollowed a period of prosperity and\nstability, if indiscriminate massacres\nto break Irish resistance can be\nconsidered stable.\nThe 'glorious re ol uti on' of 1688\nousted James E of England, a Catholic, and replaced him with the\nDutch Protestants William and Mary\nof Orange. To this reallocation of the\nmonarchy was tied a contract which\nrequired all future British monarchs\nto be Protestants, and gave more\npower to Parliament. James II\neventually went to Ireland and tried\nto found a Roman Catholic\nparliament in Dublin. Supported by\nthe Irish Roman Catholics, he\npolarised Irish society, as the\nProtestants immediately gravitated\ntowards William. Ultimately the\nCatholics were defeated, James\nretreated to the Continent and the\nThis, together with the wave of\nrevolutionary thought sweeping\nEurope because of the momentous\nevents in Russia, brought about a general resurgence of Irish\nnationalism, verging on civil war.\nThere were accusations of\ncollusion with Germany. This\nspeculation was fuelled by various\nshady dealings. Roger Casement,\nfor instance, brought German guns\nto supply the insurgents and was\nhanged for it. Dublin became a centre for riots and street fighting,\nout of which the Irish Republican\nArmy (IRA) was born. The USA also\nbrought pressure to bear on Britain,\n\u2022 - 1\n\u2022 s, Protestants deified William, becoming known as 'Orangemen'\nor 'Billy Boys'. William, to his credit,\ndid try to establish better relations\nbetween the two factions. This\ninitiative was easily crushed by the\nnew, more powerful Parliament,\nwho intended to keep a strong\nBritish presence in Ireland, enforced\nby the Protestants, for a long time.\nOver the next two centuries, there\nwere repeated famines leading to\nmass emigrations. Bills to enact\nHome Rule were introduced to\nParliament and crushed by the\nHouse of Lords and in 1900, a national republican party was\nfounded: Sinn Fein, which means\n'Ourselves Alone'. The next ten\nyears saw more unsuccessful\nattempts to introduce Home rule. At\nabout this time it became clear that\nUlster was demanding different\ntreatment from the rest of Ireland.\nWith the outbreak of the First\nWorld War, British troops were\nwithdrawn from Ireland to be\nmassacred in Gallipoli and Ypres.\nand in 1921 those counties which\nwanted independence got it.\nIt is interesting to compare this\nvery messy path to independence\nwith that of India, which achieved\nits independence under similar\ncircumstances after the Second\nWorld War. Both affairs, with\nhindsight, were horribly mismanaged, mainly by the British\nGovernment.\nThe six counties that wished to\nremain part of the United Kingdom\noccupied approximately the area\ncalled Ulster. They stayed with the\nUK because Eire was Roman Catholic (Northern Ireland was still\npredominantly Protestant) and also\nmuch poorer economically than the\nUK.\nEire objected to this political\ndivision of a geographic and cultural\nunit and has never real lv accepted\nthat Northern Ireland is part of a different country. During the\nSecond World War Eire, which was\nneutral, protested to Berlin about\nthe bombing of US bases in\nNorthern Ireland, and to London\nabout the presence of a foreign army\n(the US) on 'neutral' soil and the\nintroduction of conscription. Northern Ireland was, of course, not\nneutral as far as the United Kingdom and Germany were\nconcerned.\nIn Northern Ireland, the\nauthorities sought to encourage the\ndivision between Protestants and\nRoman Catholics and the Catholic\nminority became the underclass,\nexperiencing persecution and occupational discrimination. The\nCatholics reciprocated this\nanimosity: the IRA became a form\nof anti-Protestant h arras s ment. The\nIRA were also irritating Eire and the\nDail (the Dublin Parliament) began\na programme of internment of\nterrorist suspects in 1940 which was\nadopted in Northern Ireland thirty\nyears later.\nBy 1969 the Catholics were so\nintimidated by their Protestant\nneighbours that they invited the\nBritish Army in to avoid what Ed\nKoch, Mayor of New York, described as 'the possibility of what\nwould, against a Jewish minority, be\ncalled a pogrom.'\nSubsequently the Catholics saw\nthe Army presence, in itself,\nintimidating. Possibly adopting it as\na symbol of British (Protestant)\nsupremacy.\nThe Army started to bear the\nbrunt of civilian violence. Armies\nare not noted for diplomacy when\nattacked and they, quite\nun for giv ably, responded in kind.\nThey could manage to maintain the\nBritish troops. Dublin, 1920.\nPage 10 FELIX February 24 1989\n\n"

I would like to congratulate, by the\noccasion, the Publication Board of FELIX, for its\nenlightened approach to College life and the\nordinary students' views.\nAre you on\nthe Pill?\nDear Bill,\nThe four doctors at the Health Centre were all\nvery upset to read the letter from Anna Roberts,\nand your editorial criticising us. No we're not\nobsessed with sex and 'personal problems', but\nit is true that we are all aware that personal\nproblems, sexual problems, stresses and psycho lg ical problems can produce and/or\naggravate physical symptoms. So we often open\nup this possibility by asking relevant questions.\nHowever we certainly don't intend to offend any\nof our patients and can we ask any and ail\npatients who have been offended in the way you\nsay has happened to come and discuss it with\nus (making an appointment to do so with\nwhichever doctor they find most agreeable/least\nobjectionable!).\nOur only objective is to try to help our\npatients\u2014sometimes, however, the real problem\nis quite different from the apparent problem, and\nif we're to be able to help we need to ask\nquestions that may on occasion prove\nembarrassing.\nYours sincerely,\nRaana Cillon, Director, Health Centre.\nI am sorry that you found the Editorial offensive.\nI will be sending you the names of those\nstudents who are unhappy with the way they\nwere treated and are prepared to discuss the\nmatter with the Health Centre\u2014Ed.\nLetter lunacy\nDear Bill,\nThe Three Twits strike again! I read with a certain amount of disgust th t Messrs Baker,\nMorris and Brereton were contemplating sending\nthe Friends of Palestine and the Islamic Society\nletters concerning the anti-Jewish graffiti. Why just them? Why not every Society? Indeed, why\nnot every student? I do hope that the Union is\nnot trying to point fingers at the above societies,\nand if they are sending the letters, then this has\nto be clear discrimination and ever false\nallegation. Last year I saw the Star of David\ngraffiti ed onto Islamic Society posters. Why weren't the Jewish and Christian societies sent\nsimilar letters by the Union?\nAlso in last week's FELIX, Mr Nelkon\ncompared present day Israeli's with Nazi\nGermans. Looking at the systematic destruction\nof Palestinian villages and the subsequent\nremoval of their occupants into appalling camps\nand the more recent Israeli policies in the\nOccupied Palestine, he doesn't seem to far off.\nThe Israelis have always portrayed themselves\nas the oppressed, and one would think that they\nwould remember their own past and put an end\nto the continued oppression in Palestine.\nSaeem A Siddiqi, Civ Eng 2.\nChosen people\nDear Bill,\nLast Friday, the UN Published a report\ncondemning Israel for 'Killing children and\ntorturing detainees'. It is easy to see why certain\npeople tried to cloud the whole issue by using\nthe anti-semite graffiti incident.\nI would like here to express my disgust at both\nthe graf it ti and the found less accusations which\nI shall not bother to answer. It is, however,\ninteresting to see why and how such an incident\nwas used to launch an anti-Arab anti-Moslem\ncampaign in College.\nTaking on one fool at a time, let us start with\nthe racist graffiti posing as a letter by Mr Nelkon.\nThe understandable indignation and horror give\nway to some flawed and racist reasoning.\nBy first mentioning the Mufte of Jerusalem, Mr Nelkon seeks to land the guilt on the Friends of\nPalestine and the Islamic Society. He then\nproceeds to justify the very atrocities which set\nout to overshadow and dismiss. So, since\nPalestinians 'bear the legacy' of the Mufto of\nJerusalem then any act against them is justified\nas revenge for the Holocaust. The link is made\nthrough a Nazi madman and all of a sudden\ntoday's generation of Palestinians stands accused!\nHe also dismisses the comparison between the\nsystematic killing of jews and the 'treatment of\nArab refugees' on the grounds of quality as much\nas quantity.\nWe are, all of us, God's chosen people Mr Nelkon. He loves us all. Two wrongs can never\nmake a right and I am not willing to wait for the\nIsraeli army to kill six million Palestinians so Mr Nelkon could be convinced.\nAs for the Exec, their letters of 'concern'\ntarget ted at FoP and Islamic Society, in the\nabsence of any proof, are at best amusing, and\nat worst a clear demonstration of where their\nracial prejudices lie.\nI am glad to see that FELIX is an open forum,\nand that it allows such unfounded accusations\nand smear campaigns to be answered.\nYours sincerely,\nAmin El-Kholy, DoC 3.\nA dose of\nAllums salts\nDear Bill,\nLast week's edition of FELIX contained a letter\nwritten by Mr A Allum attacking the endeavour\nto fight effectively against loans. In response I feel\ncomp le l led to oppose this somewhat petty\nvitriolic nonsense.\nMr Allum asserts that SWSS succeeded in hijacking the Water Polo Club for their ' own political ends'. I can only presume that there\n'political ends' are a desire to stop student loans\nfrom being introduced because unfortunately for\nMr Allum I also attended the first anti-loans\nmeeting and do not remember the discussion\nveering off the subject of loans.\nIt is the threat of big marches through central\nLondon that can force the Tories to back down.\nTake the French student in December 1986: the\n2.5 million strong student strike, and the massive\ndemos that followed forced the Chirac\ngovernment to back down over its proposals to\nrestrict entry into higher education. Thankfully,\nthere weren't many French students who thought\nthat interviewing Jacques Chirac's education\nsecretary on a French version of STOIC would\nchange anything!\nMr All um also writes highly of ICU's 'independent stance'. If the exec tut ive had 1) A genuine desire to fight loans, and 2) A little bit\nof insight, they would have realised that if the\nforces of argument could defeat loans, this issue\nwould have been over long ago. Instead, Baker\nand Co indulged in the pointless lobby of\nParliament and the equally pathetic 'piss up' in\nthe Union Building on the 16th( apologies to\nBernie Grant).\nIf this is the attitude of people like Mr All um then I'm not surprised that many lefties complain\nbecause 'their causes' happen to be the causes\naffecting the well being of student life and unless\nconcerted action is taken against loans now,\nstudents, especially those living in an expensive\npart of London, will be made to suffer\nimmeasurably.\nRonan Banerjee, Materials Science.\nPage 2 FELIX February 24 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nviolence to a level where society\ncould function, but were also the\ncatalysts for that violence. Probably\nbecause of this, the Royal Ulster\nConstabulary (RUC) was formed,\nsemi-military police who were\nsupposed to act as a peace keeping\nforce. Since its members were\nalmost exclusively Protestant, it did\nnot act to ease the situation. Given\nthe state of other parts of the world,\nthe United Nations (UN) does not\nseem to have Northern Ireland high\non its priority list for providing a UN peace keeping force.\nA good model to see what would\nhappen if the army was removed is\nSri Lanka. The scenario is\ndepressingly familiar\u2014the British\ntransferred many Tamils from the\nmainland to help with tea picking.\nSince independence these Tamils\nremoved because the original act of\ncolonisation was immoral. The\nproblem is a human one.\nSome Americans who value their\nIrish ancestry, and know their\nancestors fled Ireland because of\ngross British mismanagement, still\ncherish a romantic image of a colonial Britain crushing the\nunfortunate Irish under the weight\nof colonels and drill parades. This\nis a view born of 3000 miles of ocean\nand would be laughable if it wasn't that they support the IRA through\n' No raid\". Britain is far from\nperfect\u2014that's what democracy is\nfor\u2014but most Americans are only\ntoo painfully aware that British\nImperialism was well and truly\nstrangled in the last war, and that\nthe USA played no little part in\nreallocating power from a Civil war, 1922.\nhave clam our ed for their own state,\nand due to the complete\nineffectiveness of the law keeping\nforces in that country the situation\nof terrorism and guerilla warfare\nbetween the Sinhalese and the\nTamils has slid into such a pit of\ndepravity that it bears well to think\nof it when considering Northern\nIreland. We are dealing with humans here, who are much the\nsame en masse whether they live in\nthe Indian or Atlantic seaboard.\nThe overwhelming fact in today's problems is that the Protestants of\nNorthern Ireland are Northern Irish,\nthey have the right to remain and\nstay British as long as they are in the\nmajority\u2014they have no right to\nsteamroller minorities, indulge in persecution or rampant jingoism\nsimply to provoke. They cannot be\nremoved back to Scotland: that\nwould be an act worthy of Stalin's Russia. America was colonised by\nEuropeans earlier than the\nplantation of the Protestants. It\nwould be silly to suggest that all\nnon indigenous Americans be\ndisproportionately powerful nation.\nI 've not yet given my opinion on\nthe antics of the IRA. In my rough\ndraft for this my description of them\nwas a long string of derogatory\nadjectives unfit for publication. A different string of derogatory\nadjectives could be applied to the\nantics of the British Government,\nbut mostly retrospectively, which is\nuseless. I am totally uncompromising in my denunciation of\nmurder, no matter who commits it.\nThe IRA would argue that the\ncrimes of the British Government\nare greater than theirs. I would not\ndisagree, but I would point out that\npunishing the citizens of today for\nthe crimes of yesterday is a perverted and indiscriminate form\nof justice. If all republicanism was\nlimited to Sinn Fein, I would be\npleased to accept them and watch\ndemocracy in action. As it is, Sinn\nFein wholly condones the\nmurderous activities of the IRA and\nmakes the occasional pathetic\napology when people get killed. If\nI could give some advice to them\nBritish bombardment, 1916.\nhere\u2014if you don't plant bombs, you\ndon't kill people; it's quite easy.\nMost people manage it. In my view\nthey are also being phenomenally\nstupid by hiding their issue\u2014which\nis legitimate\u2014by the far greater one\nof mass murder\u2014which is not. No British propaganda could do more\nto hurt their cause. If the\nConservative Party went round\nkilling people so it could pass its\nlegislation it would very quickly\nbecome unacceptably unpopular!\nThey have virtually avowed their\nintention to destroy democracy in\nNorthern Ireland by pressing for\nwhat they want despite being a minority political party. When the\nvast majority of seats in Northern\nIreland go to a republican party, that\nis the time for Northern Ireland to\ngo to Eire. I am realistic enough to\nsee that the likelihood of this\nhappening is practically zero. I understand the origins of the IRA,\nand that many Catholics feel bound\nto support it as it's the loudest voice\nthey have. By doing so they are\napproving murder, and I have yet\nto work out why the Vatican hasn't condemned them more strongly\nsince the IRA say they do what they\ndo with the backing of Roman\nCatholicism, and as far as I know\nthis form of Roman Catholicism\ndied out with the Borgias.\nWhat solutions are there? None just stick it out\u2014which is what the\nIRA wants to get the British public\nsick of. The problem is one only the\nIrish can solve themselves\u2014it is so\ndeep and involved, no imposed\nsolution would ever work. If, for\ninstance, Northern Ireland was\ngiven to Eire tomorrow, what then?\nA protestant guerilla army rampaging over the island and blowing\nup the traitors in the 'Dail' at\nWestminster? The present\nGovernment is panicking\u2014as can be\nseen by the shooting of the terrorists\nin Gibraltar. I can't truly say I grieve\nmuch for those shot, but the outcry\nwas justifiable because governments\ncannot be allowed to kill those who\nit considers troublemakers. Also\nthere is this totally useless act\nbanning direct quotation from Sinn\nFein and the IRA. This is a superb\nexample of the politicians syllogism\nas expanded in' Yes, Prime Minister': 'We must do something,\nThis is something, therefore we\nmust do this.'\nOnly time will solve this one, and\nthat inevitably means more tragedy.\nThings fall apart; the centre\ncannot hold,\nmere an arch}/ is loosed upon\nthe world'.\n- W.B. Yeats.\nFebruary 24 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

I recently read a note from a US colleague saying 'In\nfree society people will choose the\nlevel of pollution they desire, and\nregulate it, and the efficiency of the\nfree market will ensure the fastest\nand most cost effective solution to\nachieve those pollution levels'.\nUnfortunately, this opinion, shared by the British government,\nis dangerously complacent. A 'free'\nsociety may try to choose the level\nof pollution it desires, but several\nfactors make control impossible in\npractice.\nThere is a delay between the use\nof something and the evidence of\nthe pollution it causes. It takes time\nfor the pollution to cause\nenvironmental damage. It takes\nsomething like twenty years for the\nCFCs produced at any point in time\nto fully filter up to the ozone layer.\nThis means that even if we stop all\nuse of CFCs immediately, it may be\ntoo late to prevent serious effects\nover the next few decades.\nResearch into the environmental\neffects of substances always lags\nbehind their exploitation. This is\nexacerbated in society by the desire\nto fully exploit the benefits (usually\nfinancial) of use as fast as possible.\nOccasionally this has even led to\nfalsification of laboratory reports,\nwhich further delays proper\nresearch into the effects.\nFinally, there's the NIMBY (not in\nOpinion\nby Berke Breathed\nACIP SNOW...\nozoNe peP tenoN.

Societies\nquite happily control pollution of\ntheir own areas, whilst exporting\npollution elsewhere.\nIn North America and Northern\nEurope, acid rain is damaging\nforests in countries other than the\nones in which the chemicals which\ncause it originate. The usual\nresponse of the government of the\nproducer country is to deny the\ncausal link, and delay proper\ninvestigation, simply because it is\nnot under pressure from its own citizens to do something about it.\nWhilst a piecemeal approach can\ntackle the most urgent problems\nfacing the planet, the key to long\nterm change is individual action\nbased on a revolution in attitudes.\nEvery person must understand his\nor her impact on the environment,\nand adapt to reduce the detrimental\neffects. Every one of us should think\nabout our lifestyles and consider\nhow to become less wasteful, less\npolluting and less materialistic.\nAny one interested in finding out\nmore can drop in to the Centre for\nreprinted by kind permission of the Guardian\nEnvironmental Technology at 48\nPrinces Gardens. The Centre carries\nout research . in many areas of\nenvironmental science and policy\nand runs an MSc in Environmental\nTechnology. Also look out for the\nEnvironmental and Appropriate\nTechnology's Society's collection of\nbooks in the Haldane library.\nSteve\nEasterbrook\nScientists have spent a great deal of\ntime trying to understand exactly\nwhy the great dinosaurs became\nextinct a hundred-million years ago\nbut they are ignoring a problem of\neven greater magnitude which is\noccur ing today.\nUnder the ice of Antactica is a diversity of oil and minerals that\nmany countries are squabbling over.\nIn their greed, they are not willing\nto spend money on the\nsophisticated research vital to\npredict the results of such\nexploitation on the continent's complex and fragile environment.\nWe know that about 90% of the\nworld's fresh water is contained in\nthe ice cap and that this ice plays an\nimportant role in global climates.\nDust from mining or an oil spill\n(which in Antarctica is impossible to\nclear up) lowers ice reflectance of the\nsun and this imbalance could\nchange weather patterns and alter\nsea levels to an extent that would\nthreaten global cities worldwide.\nIt has been estimated that an\naccident in which one tanker cargo\nspilt in the Ross Sea would affect\none million square kilometres of\nocean.\nA large oil leakage would have\ndisaster o us effects on the declining\nwhale population of the Antartic. In\n1981 scientists from the International\nWhaling Commission reported that\nwhaling had reduced Bluw Whales\nto less than 5 % of their original\npopulation and humpback whales\nto 3%; the few remaining great\nwhales would easily be killed by the\ninterference of an oil slick with their\nfeeding, breathing, migration and\ncommunication methods.\nThere would also be drastic\nconsequences for shore breeding\nbirds and seals. They inhabit scarce\nice-free coastal regions and already\nmany breeding sites have been lost\nto scientific research stations.\nNot only do these stations\nencroach on important habitats but\nthey pollute the sea by pumping\nwaste directly into it. Indeed at one\nsite many tonnes of earth had to be\nexcavated after a nuclear reactor\nleakage. This conflict between\nscience and the ecosystem will only\nincrease if oil companies are allowed\nuse of the shoreline.\nUnless immediate steps are taken\nto control actions in Antartica we\nwill not only destroy a beautiful and\nisolated continent but we will\njeopardize the whole of human\ncivilisation.\nFebruary 24 1989 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nA life in the city\nThe alternative guide\nto finding somewhere\nto live in London.\nStudents in London already face a severe accommodation problem,\nand it's going to get worse. This\narticle is intended to inform and\nmotivate anyone currently looking\nfor accommodation, when faced\nwith high rents and poor conditions,\nto think about the alternatives. It\nprovides a guide to the main options\navailable, short-life housing in housing cooperatives and squatting,\nand attempts to assess their relative\nadvantages and disadvantages over\nnormal rented accommodation.\nLow cost accommodation in London is still available, it's just a matter of getting informed and\norganised. The financial savings\npossible should provide enough\nmotivation to overcome the\ndifficulties involved. *\nRented accommodation in London is, as everyone knows,\nexpensive in comparison to the rest\nof the country. Most London students are in rented\naccommodation. A typical rent for\na single room will be \u00a345 per week.\nWhilst rented accommodation for\n\u00a330 per week is still available, this\nis generally for shared rooms or\naccommodation in the outer London\nboroughs where money saved in\nrent is lost again due to high\ncommuting costs. A look at the\npresent accommodation lists\n(January 1989) from the Imperial\nCollege Accommodation Office\nconfirms this price range.\nAt the moment students are\nentitled to Housing Benefit.\nHowever, the system is notoriously\nunreliable and complicated. The\nrecent amendments alone amount\nto thirty pages of A4 size diagrams.\nPayments are often delayed and the\nfinal sum given appears to be\ndecided more on how generous the\nlocal authority is rather than any\nactual financial considerations. The\nHousing Benefit system can also\ncreate a poverty trap, where the\nstudent is unable to earn money as\nthis might lead to a reduction of the\nbenefit given. There have even been\ncases where not only has the benefit\nbeen stopped but the student has\nbeen asked to pay back that already\nreceived.\nThe Housing Benefit system,\nsits iii l \u2022 H \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n. , \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 :\nYou can find shared accommodation for \u00a330 per week\ndespite all its faults, does provide an\nessential subsidy to the cost of\nrented accommodation. In some\ncases this can amount to \u00a320 per\nweek or more. With Housing\nBenefit considered, rented\naccommodation is still cheaper than\nthe limited College and intercollegiate hall accommodation\navailable in London. (Incidentally\nImperial College halls are some of\nthe most expensive in London, rents\nbeing set near the maximum that the\nstudents will tolerate.)\nAlthough the financial cost of\nbeing a student in London is high\nalready, very soon it may get a lot\nworse. In the near future several\nfactors may come together to make\nstudying in London extremely\ndifficult financially. These factors\ninclude the introduction of the Poll\nTax, the changes in the grant system\nin the Government's white paper\n'Top-up loans for students' and\nchanges in the Housing Benefit\nsystem.\nBriefly these proposals are still in\nthe planning stage so it is possible\nthat they will never be put into\naction or if they are, then in a diluted form. However, at the\nmoment it is proposed that students\nwill have to pay 20% of the Poll Tax\nwhen it is introduced. Simultaneously the White Paper\nproposes that the level of grant and\nparental contribution be frozen from\n1990 onwards whilst at the same\ntime removing students from the\nbenefit system so that they are no\nlonger able to claim Housing Benefit, Income Support or\nUnemployment Benefit during the\nSummer Vacation.\nThe changes to Housing Benefit,\nin itself, are a serious threat. They\nare contained in a separate White\nPaper from 1985. It is now very\nlikely Housing Benefit will be\nstopped for students in 1990. What\nwill replace it, if anything, remains\nto be- seen but it is hardly likely to\nbe an improvement.\nOther important changes have\nalready taken place, although their\neffects have not yet been felt fully.\nUntil recently most students\nreceived their parental contribution\nin the form of a covenant for which\nthey could claim tax back. Now this\nis no longer possible following\nchanges in the law.\nAn extremely important change\naffecting rented accommodation has\ncome into effect just last month\n(January 1989), with very little\npublicity. The Government has deregulated rent, thus relaxing its\ncontrols on rent increases. The\nImperial's Fremantle Hotel is rumoured to have been\nburned down for insurance reasons.\nPage 6 FELIX February 24 1989\n\n"

The\nUniversity Grants Committee( UGC) have set a deadline of four\nyears from now for the new Imperial\nCollege to become completely\nintegrated at every level financially.\nThe 'informal working group'\nwhich proposed the abolition of\nUG Ms are working under pressure\nto get the two Unions merged\nquickly and this, I fear, is bringing\nfar too many concessions from the\nIC side.\nSt Mary's have a definite fixed\nidentity, a strong and deliberately\nmaintained independence which\nthey will not wish to part with.\nImperial College Union is a much\nlarger body.

This does not mean that\nthey have been idle; on the contrary,\nthey seem to have found a brand\nnew image for STOIC as can be seen\nfrom the following events (which\nnever happened).\nTwo shadowy figures in dirty\nraincoats and dark glasses sneak up\nthe stairs to the STOIC studio and,\nlooking over their shoulders, knock\non the door. The first figure stands\nlike a man that screws a lot of\nnurses, and the second looks like\nChas Brereton, Union Deputy\nPresident. Both look very nervous.\n\"I want to see the Boss,\" said the\nnurse-molester. \" Who is it?\" asked\na gruff voice from within. \"It's the\nBlue Movie Brothers.\"\nA random menial opens the door\nand leads the Blue Movie Brothers\nto a room overflowing with wires\nand uselessly expensive equipment.\nIn the middle of the room sits an\namorphous figure with a pimp's hat\nand crocodile boots - it's Johnny D., the Boss. \" Have you got the stuff?\"\n\"Yeah, six hours of sizzling, sticky\nstimulation.

EEEK!\nThe rat-catchers have found me.\nMust scuttle.\nAll my Love,\nNorman (The Ex-Union Rat)\nI St Mary's No Thanks\nby Neil Motteram\nOne of the most telling things said\nat the Union General Meeting on\nJanuary 31 was by Phil Drew,\nPresident of St Mary's Union,\nduring the count of the U GM abolition vote. U GM Chairman\nDave Burns asked if Mr Drew would\nlike to make a report '...because\nyou're part of us now'. The reply\nwas 'Mary's don't like IC UG Ms'. Mary's don't like IC UG Ms. They\nobject to our method of self-government so much that when\nthey had the opportunity to get it\nremoved and power shifted up the\nladder to a Council with a disproportionate weighting in favour of Mary's, they were willing\nto cancel afternoon lectures and\nIn the land of Palestine, a new state\nwas created in1948. Most of the\noriginal inhabitants were expelled.\nTheir country and their lands had\nbeen usurped by an alien people. It\nis these facts which have created the\nPalestine question.\nThe unique nature of the ArabIsraeli conflict, its aggravation by\nfive wars and its complication by the\ninterests and ambitions of the great\npowers, have made the Palestine\nquestion one of the most explosive\nin the world today. Five wars have\nalready occurred between the Arabs\nand the Israelis and hostilities\ncontinue despite the Armistice\nagreements of 1949 and the Security\nCouncil's cease-fire orders of 1967,\nwith no end or peace yet in sight.\nThe first step towards peace is to\nremove the smoke-screen that has\nbeen laid by Zionist pro pog and a, and to lay bare the injustice to the\npeople of Palestine which is at the\nroot of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nWithout an understanding of the\nessence of the conflict, world public\nopinion will remain in ignorance\nand will continue to extend its\nsympathy and support to Israel\nwhich has caused so much havoc\nand destruction in the Middle Eas..\nContrary to Israel's expectations,\nthe war which it launched on June\n5th1967 did not solve the problems\nthey created nor did it enable it to\nimpose its ' diktat' upon the\nPalestinians by occupying approximately 20% of Palestine they\nhad not yet seized. In fact, the\nnumerous Israeli oppression s released the Palestinian forces of\nresistance which had been\ncontained by illusions in the UN and\nits resolutions. The power of the\nIsraeli army (very heavily funded by\nthe US) ruled in all conflicts and the\nPalestinians come to realise that\neven in our era of civilisation what\nis lost by force can be regained only\nby force. But the force that the\nPalestinians want to exert upon\nIsrael is not that of sophisticated\naircraft, missiles, chemical and nuclear weapons (which Israel\npossesses, unlike the Palestinians),\nbut that of negotiation. That is the\none weapon that the Israeli\ngovernment is the most frightened\nof, because it is concerned with talk\nof 'human rights' and 'international\nlaws', which Israel openly contravened and still contravenes.\nThe sole and legitimate\nrepresentative of the Palestinians,\nthe PLO, wants the Palestinians to\nhave their human rights back,\nincluding self-determination, and\nthe right of expelled refugees to\nreturn to their motherland. Such an\ninitiative is possible in the framework of an international\nconference on Middle East peace in\norder for the outcome to be\nimplemented under UN supervision.\nAH who care for peace, justice and\nhuman rights, and also the future of\nthe Jewish people, must hope that\nZionism, with its connotations to\nracism, gives way to a wiser and\nmore human view of the indigenous\ninhabitants of Palestine: the\nPalestinian people.\nFebruary 24 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

Nothing but lies!'\nshrieks Yvonne, over-possessive\nmother and eager invalid, and in that freakish moment of hysterical\nlucidity diagnoses the central cause\nof the chaos in Cocteau's explosive\ntale of domino deception.\nYvonne is lying to herself that her\ncloying embrace upon darling son\nMichael is a mother's natural\nconcern and not a blinding jealousy\nof other women. Michael feels\nforced by this into lying with his\nsilence about an ongoing affair. He\nvows to let his dearest diabetic\nmummy 'Sophie' (as he calls her in\nan overly intimate game of theirs)\nknow the truth as soon as the\nunpalatable complications are put\nright: knowing that her emotional\ndiet is at least as critical as the sugar\nlevel in her blood. Michael's lover\nMadelaine is no less untrue in her\ndivided affections. Favouring the\nyoung innocent she is dithering in\nher dismissal of an older and\nprevious lover who, by uncomfortable coincidence, is\nMichael's adulterous father George.\nDistanced from his ailing wife,\nGeorge becomes bitter when he\ndiscovers he is cast as the wronged\nfool in a tragedy cum farce.

Leo has\nlong ago buried an undeclared love\nand seems hardened to the\n'children's' emotional grappling\nhooks. Thus qualified she is eagerly\nrecruited to undo deception's work\nwith a more sophisticated lie. Leo's loyalties are not so certain though,\nand neither are her murky motives,\nuntil the final tragic twist.\nNone of the adult players can\nclaim a moral superiority in this\ngame, though self-justification\nabounds. The only true innocent,\nMichael, makes naivety seem almost\na crime, but undoubtedly he is the\nmost wronged and it is with him\nthat we are supposed to\nsym pathis e. Depending on one's sympathies, mood and disposition\nthe whole may be read as the tragic\nfrustration of love, or as the\ninevitable emotional melee in the\nclash of wills that is life. For this is\nlife with the temperature turned up\nfull, and the Orange Tree is just the\nplace to cook up such a superheated\nanimation. The players put in brave\nand confident performances as they\nflit manic ly past the audience in the\naisles, often close enough to touch\nand always close enough to feel the\nheat.\nTwo minutes from Richmond\nStation and only twenty odd minutes from central London the\nOrange Tree is one of the most\nconsistently praised fringe venues in\ntown.

    "content": "Felix\nQ T1H IH Scientists at Imperial College are now adapting one of the simplest and\n-TL/ oldest optical instruments, the pinhole camera, for use in holography. Their\n\u2014 \u2022 li iiii \u2014 experiments may eventually lead to optical computers. Sunny Bains\nJ investigates.\n\u2014 0\nPoints of light\nMaking a pinhole camera out of a shoe box is a standard experiment\ndone in science classes all over the\nworld. Scientists in the Optics\nSection of the Physics Department\nhave extended this simple device\nand made pinhole holograms:\nholograms which may have\napplications in optical computing\nand information processing.\nAn ordinary hologram is recorded\nusing a laser beam which is split into\ntwo. One half, the 'object beam', is\nreflected off the object and onto a photo-sensitive plate. The rest of the\nbeam is directed onto the plate\nunaltered. This is known as the\n'reference beam'.\nThe object and reference beams\ninterfere as they hit the\nphotographic plate to produce a pattern. When light is shone on the\ndeveloped plate, it is unevenly\nreflected in such a way that it\nappears to have been reflected off\nthe original object. In effect, it seems\nthat the object is there.\nThe Imperial scientists have\nplaced a pinhole between the object\nand the recording plate. This\neffectively becomes part of the\nobject and when the hologram is\nreconstructed, all the light from it\npasses through this point, as if the\nreal pinhole were still there. Other\ndevices can be placed at this point\nto manipulate the image.\nOne of the experiments carried\nout by Shenchu Xu, Geraldo\n, Mendes, Stephen Hart and Chris\nDainty was to make two holograms\nof different objects on the same\nholographic plate, moving the\npinhole slightly each time. They\ncould then block out one of the\nimages by putting a small object\n(they used a knife edge) at the\nposition of the appropriate pinhole,\nleaving the other image to\nreconstruct normally.\nIn this way it is possible to make\na hologram containing many different images, each with its own pinhole in an array. Shutters placed\nin front of the pinholes can be open\nand closed to give any combination\nof these images.\nIt would also be possible to\nreplace the shutters with a liquid\ncrystal device which, instead of\nsimply allowing an image to be 'off\nor 'on', could give gradual changes\nin intensity. In either case, it would\nallow the image, and hence the way\nthe light is reflected, to be changed.\nIt would be programmable.\nAnother experiment carried out at\nImperial College involved putting a diffraction grating in the way of the\npinhole. This gives many images\nside by side. Other optical elements\ncould be used in a similar way to\nmanipulate the image.\nIf each point of light in the image\nObject Reference Beam\nPinhole\nPlate\nHologram\nHolographic Image\n'Image' of Pinhole\n\\\nIncident\nBeam\nRecording and reconstructing a pinhole hologram\nactivates its own detector, then a device consisting of a pinhole\nhologram and a shutter or optical\nsystem could act as an optical\n'interconnect' or switch and so\ncould be used in optical computing.\nSo far, researchers have used\narrays of 273 points, each 50 microns\nin diameter and separated by 250\nmicrons, in their experiments giving\nan image only a few millimetres\nacross. This is only slightly larger\nthan would be needed for an optical\ncomputer, and the researchers\nbelieve this work can be scaled\ndown.\nSouthkenders\n-TAP | VJ iT rt N0UR. VISION fX NPT.

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCaught 'blue-handed'\nA member of Imperial's Conservative Society may face the\nUnion Disciplinary Committee after\ntearing down posters put up by the\nStudents Against Loans (SAL)\nCampaign.\nThe student concerned, Dylan\nJames, a Maths first year, was\ndiscovered removing posters from\nthe Physics Common Room on Tuesday night by two SAL supporters. When challenged, Mr James claimed that the posters\ncontravened Union Publicity rules\nbecause they lacked the name of a Club or Society and said that\n'Student Loans would benefit every\none.'\nMr James had attended the SAL meeting earlier that day when he\nmade suggestions on the way loans\nshould be tackled and had taken a number of anti loans posters to pin\nup.\nA Spokesman from the SAL group told FELIX that the posters\ncontained the logo iC Union S CC Students Against Loans Month' and\nwere therefore in line .with Union\nPublicity requirements. He went on\nto say that ninety SAL posters had\ndisappeared over the past two weeks. Julian Moore, acting chairman of\nthe SAL Campaign commented ' Mr James is playing God with student\npolitics. People not only have the\nright to freedom of speech; they\nhave the right to advertise issues\nand meetings.'\nFELIX received a letter from Mr James earlier in the week in which\nhe condemned Socialist Worker\nStudents' Society for allegedly\nremoving Conservative Society's publicity. Later in the week he\napproached a member of the FELIX\nstaff asking for the letter to be\ndiscreetly removed from the office.\nThe letter is reproduced here.\nMr James was unwilling to\ncomment on the incident, but ICU Honorary Secretary Ian Morris said\nthat he was taking the matter\n'seriously'.\nDear Bill,\nThere have been complaints in recent issues er f FELIXabouttheUnion tearing down SWSSposters.\nI wish to complain about SWSS tearing down\nConSoc posters.\nLast Monday (13.2.89) about 50 of our ConSoc\nposters were put up at 9am. By 10.30am almost all\nof them had been torn down, and many of them\nwere replaced by SWSSposters. Surely it is too much\nof a coincidence that so many SWSS posters were\nput up where Consoc posters were.\nThe tearing down of ConSocpostersbySWSS has\nI been witnessed by non-Conservativefriendsofmine.\nIhope those involved will realise the futility of their\nI actions, and that this will stop.\nI Yours sincerely,\nDylan James, Maths 1.\nBristol bomb blast\nAnimal Liberation Societies have\nclaimed responsibility for a bomb\nexplosion at Bristol University\nyesterday morning. The incident\nhas led to speculation that further\nattacks may be levelled at other\nUniversities in the country.\nThe bomb, which exploded at 1\nminute past midnight, wrecked the\nfourth floor of the main administration building and 'severely damaged' the third and\nfifth floors. The building was empty\nat the time of explosion.\nThe University received an anonymous phone call at 11.40 am\nwarning of the bomb threat. The\nbuilding was evacuated and searched with sniff er dogs but no\nsigns of explosives were found and\nthe building was reopened at 3 pm.\nBristol University Students Union\n(BUSU) Vice President Russel Payne\ntold FELIX that although a Union\nSociety which was a branch of the\n'Western Animal Alliance' existed\nlast year, he is 'about as certain as\npossible' that the bombing had\n'nothing to do with the students'.\nHe commented that Bristol\nUniversity has had a 'bad reputation\nfor animal experimentation' in the\npast, but claimed that strong\nfeelings against the medical and\nveterinary faculties have now 'died\ndown'. Professor Pearson of the\nfaculty of Veterinary Surgery\nstressed that 'at present' his department undertakes ' no experiments that would give rise to\nany anger of any sort'.\nIn response to fears that the police\nfailed to discover the bomb on their\noriginal search, a press conference\nwas told yesterday that police are\nconsidering the pos sibi l ty that the\nexplosives were planted after the\nreopening of the building.\nA major investigation involving\n200 officers has been initiated and\nBUS U who described the event as\n'fruitless and futile and a set-back to\nthe issue of animal rights' are\nhelping police with their enquiries.\nThe national Union of Students\n(NUS) will be marching tomorrow\nfrom Victoria Embankment to\nKennington Park via Whitehall in\nprotest at the introduction of\nstudent loans. The march is being\nsupported by Imperial College\nUnion. Over three hundred porters\nand several thousand of leaflets\nhave been produced to advertise the\nevent.\nThe NUS is taking steps to defend\nthose arrested in the November\ndemonstration, and are considering\npressing charges against some\nmembers of the police.\nThey are working in conjunction\nwith Bindman and Partners\nsolicitors, gathering evidence from\nseveral videos of the incident on\nWestminster Bridge.\nISSUE 829 24 FEB 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nHenry VI\nThe Wars of the Ros\nThe Wars of the Roses\u2014the saga\ncontinues.\nHouse of Lancaster\nWe are thrust into turbulent times.\nHenry V is dead; leaving to a baby\nthe crown of England. The Duke of\nGloucester is Lord Protector, and he\nhas not the divine authority to meld\nthe court together. The French have\nrevolted and into their ranks rises\nJoan of Arc to drive England back.\nValiant Lord Talbot battles away to\nsave English pride, but loses the\nday.\nThe stormy seas of strife breed\nbreezes of dissension. Feuding\nRichard Plantagenet and the Earl of\nSomerset divide the nobles of\nEngland in two. They pluck roses as\nsymbols in Temple Gardens; white\nfor York and red for Lancaster.\nWhile Englishmen quarrel, the\nFrench Dauphin still fights. But Joan\nloses Rouen and in a blaze of light\nshe dies.\nThe young King grows to be a reluctant ruler. He needs to be\nstrong, but his heart flounders. Into\nhis court comes the Earl of Sussex,\nwhose we as le like words twist\ncloser to power. Who knows what\nriches he has gleaned, for he has a mistress who is also a Queen. But\nhe over stretches the line one day,\nwhen he orders the murder of\nGloucester, Old Protector.\nGloucester is strangled in his bed,\nand for this pusillanimous Suffolk\nloses his head.\nAnd so ends part one of the reign\nof King Henry. Read on for part\ntwo, for the trouble's just started.\nHouse of York\nHenry now is an old wise man, yet\nstrength of will eludes him still.\nRichard of York now plots against\nhim; stirring up revolt to unsettle\nthe King. And so in earnest begin\nthe Wars, between Lancaster and\nYork\u2014to the victor the crown.\nWho' s good, who' s bad we cannot fathom. Who's right, who's wrong is a nebulous question. All seem worthy, proud and valiant, yet\nin unsettled times ambition is\nrampant. Confusion holds fast with\nloyalties uncertain. Fate seems\ntwisted as fortunes change often.\nRichard's four sons fight bravely\nbeside him, the most cunning of all\nbeing his namesake, the hunchback.\nBattles are fought and many are\nslain. Amongst them poor York who\ndies in shame. But his-sons rise up\nand avenge his death, and Edward,\nthe eldest, put the crown on his\nhead.\nThe crooked, warped figure of\nRichard plans on, for it is power he\ncares regardless of wrongs. He strikes down old Henry, locked up\nin the Tower, and then plots the\ndownfall of his very own brothers.\nWith Henry's death, an evil mind\nnow plots for Yorks descent, but a son is born to Edward much to\nRichard's discontent.\nEnough of this verse. This\nShakespeare stuff is going to my\nhead! Shakespeare wrote Henry VI\nin three parts. These works are\nconsidered unwieldy by many, and\nso the ESC have condensed them\ninto two plays\u2014House of Lancaster\nPennington, who plays Sussex in\nPart 1, and in Part 2 a punk thug,\nlooking like Johnny Rotten,\nspreading rebellion and preaching\nanarchy.\nIt is a joy to see such a high level\nof acting coupled with a supremely\neccentric production that never loses\nits head in the maelstrom of activity,\nbut rather clarifies the proceeding\nand makes it a thro roughly engrossing, if extremely violent,\njourney through history and I would recommend it to anyone.\nIn the essence of continuity, Part\n2 ends with Richard's chilling\nspeech ' Now is the winter of our\nand House of York. They also\nattempt (successfully) to transpose\nthe settings to more familiar ones of\nthis century to emphasis the divisive\ntenets held in more modern times.\nContinuity of the el ct ric style of\npresentation with the previous plays\nin the scenes is maintained, but the\nsubstance of the plays lack the usual\nShakespearian storytelling\nsubtleties, giving away the fact that\nthese were Shakespeare's first\nhistorical plays and not, as the\nproduction suggests, part of a long\nseries of chronological plays.\nBoth parts are serious and dramatic, narrating the struggle for\nthe throne between the two Houses.\nThe productions are solid and clear\nin their intentions. However, there\nis a sense of being swamped in all\nthat is going on.\nThe performances are absorbing;\nPaul Brennan exhibits just the right\nlevel of insecurity as Henry VI, but\nlesser roles are given greater\ntreatment, especially by Michael\ndiscontent...' to usher in the next\nplay. So read on for the rousing and\ntriumphant conclusion of this\nincredible saga.\nCue Richard III.\nSumit Guha.\nRichard III\nAnd so the curtain rises to a scene\nof Noel Cowardesque figures\nmilling around a coffin, drinking\nchampagne, engaging in garden\nparty n' ce ties and some necessary\nmourning for dead King Henry VI,\nwhile the dulcet tones of jazz wash\nover them, played by a band so laid\nback they are almost falling over.\nThe sturdy figure of Barry\nStanton, (earlier Falstaff, Richard of\nYork and Chorus) cuts through this,\nimpeccably attired and brandishing\na clipboard, and proceeds to explain\nevery detail of plot and character\ninter-relations of all present. The\nprologue is perfectly executed (a taste of things to come) and provides a merriment and cheer\nwhich sadly is never equalled in the\nfollowing three and a half hours.\nThe disfigured flautist hobbles to\nthe front and, sweeping a curtain\nacross the scene, begins the play\nproper. ' Now is the winter of our\ndiscontent...'. The hunchback is\nRichard, Duke of Gloucester,\nbrother to King Edward IV, and a man with a hefty chip on his\nshoulder. As we have just been\nwarned he is about to embark on a dastardly plan to secure the crown\nfor himself.\nThe plan is so fiendishly contrived, and administered with\nsuch mind blowing subtlety that it\ncould well be a Black Adder script.\nThe death count is so great that, had\nit not been for the small detail of\nhistorical fact, one could almost say\nShakespeare had dreamed this up\nduring his Friday the Thirteenth\nphase.\nAs in the six previous plays, there\nis strong acting by all concerned,\nwith a couple (John Dougall and\nSion Probert) even trying to steal a little limelight from the true star,\nAndrew Jarvis. The overpowering\ncombination of his natural acting\nability and his melodramatic\neccentricity gives Jarvis a resounding victory on that front\nthough. This man has real talent. He\nought to be on stage.\nBut back to the story: with a string\nof deaths behind him, a crown on\nhis head, and a vengeful peerage\naround him, King Richard faces a revolt from Henry, Earl of\nRichmond. In battle on Bos worth\nfield, the King dies, after a rather\nwell choreographed and terribly\nexciting sword fight. Richmond becomes Henry VII, and gives a television broadcast to the nation in the hope of uniting everybody\nunder the new Tudor dynasty:\n' Now civil wounds are stopped,\npeace lives again; that she may long\nlive here, God say. A men!'. Richard HI is pretty good stuff. I found it overly long though, and as\na result remember it best for one or\ntwo images\u2014the dreams before the\nbattle in Act V Scene III, Queen\nMargaret wandering forlornly,\nshabby, resembling a want on creature more recognisable in a corner of Leicester Square station-rather than the performance as a whole. It is worth seeing for\nAndrew Jarvis alone however, and\nI recommend it, therefore, to all.\nThis ambitious project, The War of\nthe Roses, is showing at the Old Vic,\nWaterloo Road, until March 11.\nGroup bookings for ten or more\nstudents are available, as are\nstandby tickets, both at just \u00a36. You\nwould be hard pressed to find a more entertaining or more refined\nproduction anywhere in London.\nAndrew Clarke.\nFebruary 24 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nThe mysterious disappearance of the Students Against Loans (SAL)\npublicity from around College over the past two weeks has aroused\na good deal of speculation within the FELIX office. After much\ndeliberation, deduction and elimination, we were able to attribute\nthe following explanations...\n1. SAL were using a cheap brand of blu-tak.\n2. The posters were printed on rapidly bio-de grad able paper.\n3. They were printed in invisible ink.\n4. The Physics department suffers from powerful and unexpected gusts\nof wind.\nImagine our surprise when we discovered that the posters had been\ndeliberately taken down by a member of that fine and upstanding group\nof individuals, the IC Conservative Society.\nSabbatical Elections\nThe Hustings UGM will take place next Thursday in the Great Hall. There\nyou will have a chance to listen to and ask questions of this year's Sabbatical candidates.\nDo not underestimate the importance of electing the right candidates\nfor the posts. In the past the College has shown no reluctance to walk\nall over weak sabbatical officers, as those who remember the College's mano ev rings to build the QT burger bar in the Union's JCR, will testify.\nBoring but true\nNext week's FELIX is the manifestos issue. Manifestos should be submitted\nby Monday at 10.00am accompanied by a photograph if required. Late\nmanifestos will not be accepted. Manifestos should be a maximum of 300\nwords including names and titles; overlong manifestos will be cut at the\n300th word. Candidates will not be allowed to proof read their own\nmanifestos but members of FELIX staff will ensure they are printed exactly\nas written.\nBroken nose\nIf any more rude, arrogant, obnoxious prat s from Dramsoc call into the\noffice on a weekend and insist that I drop everything immediately to\nphotocopy a script for them I will probably fly off the handle and give them\na broken nose. The same can be said for those people who come into the\noffice insisting that I print their small ads, letters, or complain when when\ntheir badly written articles are edited.\nLet me point out - for the last time - that the job of an editor is to edit.\nWriting a letter into FELIX does not guarantee that it will be printed or\nedited to fit the space on the letters page.

    "content": "Opinion\nPoisoned planet?\nSuddenly, everyone seems to be worried about the environment. The\nperennial sixties worry about a nuclear holocaust has been replaced by\nconcerns about the slow poi sion ing of the planet. We face the certain\ndestruction of life on Earth within a century unless action is taken NOW.\nWhere once ecology meant saving little patches of picturesque countryside,\nwe now face a global problem rapidly advancing on several fronts.\nDecades of disregard for the effects\nof our civilisation upon the planet\nhave led to an accumulation of\npollution, now accelerating the\ngreenhouse effect, causing ozone\nholes, acid rain, the poisoning of\nrivers and seas, and the progressive\nloss of fertile land. As if this weren't enough, our constant desire for\nmore living space means that\nforests, and in particular the\nvaluable tropical rainforests, are still\nbeing destroyed at an alarming rate,\nleading to soil erosion, desertification, river silting, and\nflooding. We are using up the\nEarth's natural resources as if there\nwere no tomorrow, burying the\nwaste, or dumping it at sea, hoping\nit will go away.\nAny one of these factors, taken by\nitself will radically alter the face of\nthe Earth within our lite times. The\nvast increase in Carbon Dioxide in\nthe atmosphere caused by burning\nfossil fuels and abetted by the\ndestruction of the rain forests\nprevents heat absorbed by the\natmosphere being reflected back\ninto space.\nEven the most conservative\nmodels of this 'Greenhouse' process\npredict a global warming of around\nthree degrees within 50 years. That\nmay sound pleasant until you consider what effect this will have.\nThe polar caps will recede and the\nseas expand causing flooding of\nmost low land areas (that's all of\nEast Anglia, London and Holland).\nAt the same time the equatorial\nregions will become uninhabitable\ncausing such a massive migration of\npopulations that war will be\ninevitable. (Imagine the entire\nNo wonder 'green' issues are set\nto become the hottest political topic\nof the next decade. All over the\nworld people are talking urgently\nabout protecting the environment.\nHowever, global problems need\nglobal solutions, and international\nco-operation is vital. To restrict\nfurther damage to the ozone layer,\nevery country must drastically cut\nits production of chl or of lu oro carbons (CFCs) for use in aerosol\npropellents.\nWhat goes up must come down.\npopulation of Africa pouring northwards into Europe). All within\nour lifetimes.\nSo, this is all only conjecture, eh?\nWrong. It is happening now. The\nrecurring famines in Ethiopia are\nman-made. So are the floods in\nIndia. All these areas were once\ncovered in forest which regulated\nthe weather.\nThere is a widespread feeling that\nthe environment is someone else's problem, but what is really needed\nis for everyone to stop demanding\never more comfortable lifestyles and\nto start living in harmony with the\nplanet.\nOur culture needs nothing short\nof a revolution in attitudes.\nEveryone must understand exactly\nwhat irreplaceable resources they\nare using up, how exactly things are\nproduced, and how pollution is\ncaused. Every time you buy or use\nsomething, ask yourself is it\nnecessary? Is it made from irreplaceable materials? Will you\nmake full use of it? When you\ndiscard something, ask yourself if it\ncould be reused. Or, failing that,\nrecycled. Could you use less\nenergy? After all, it's far easier to\nconserve than to try and find clean\nways to produce ever more\nelectricity. Once you have grasped these\nbasic changes in attitude, it's time\nto inform those in power about how\nyou feel. In our democratic system,\npoliticians are only interested in\npopularity and votes. Whilst they\nbelieve that everyone wants a more\naffluent society, and that everyone\nwants to consume more, they will\ncontinue to ignore long term\nproblems in favour of saving public\nmoney and improving the economy.\nAny MP will tell you that there is\nnot enough money to do all that the\nenvironmentalists demand as\nnecessary to safeguard the planet.\nHowever, this is definately not true.\nWhat they mean is that there is not\nenough money left over after they\nhave satisfied other priorities, such\nas stimulating economic growth,\nand winning votes by reducing\ntaxes. Economic growth is only\nnecessary to continue improving the\nstandard of living if you assume that\nthe only way to improve your\nstandard of living is to have more\nmoney to spend. This extra money\nwill only be spent on more\nconsumer goods, accelerating the\nBLOOM COUNTY by Berke Breathed\n\\ QUICKER THAN THGY'Re\\ o ern N'eem K.o fa' ^$>y \u00b0\nPage 8 FELIX February 24 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\ntheory behind this move is to\nencourage the letting of more living\naccommodation by allowing landlords to charge even higher\nrents. Its immediate effect is\nprobably going to be an increase in\nthe present rents. According to\nsome sources rents in certain parts\nof London are predicted to rise\ndramatically. When one considers\nwhat has happened to house prices\nin cent ra1 London over recent years,\nsimilar rises in rents can only be\nexpected now that regulation no\nlonger controls rent increases. The\nrights of the tenant to appeal against\nrises, which might be unfair, has\nalso been reduced. The law has\nswung from protecting the tenant to\nfavouring the landlord.\nIf rents in central London do rise\ndramatically many people will move\noutwards and rely on commuting\nlong distances. Apart from the time\nand inconvenience this involves, the\ncost of commuting is also rising. The\nlatest tube fare increases at the\nbeginning of this year were up to\n16% more on some tickets. A journey involving night buses that\npreviously cost \u00a32, using a one-day\ntravel card, more than doubled due\nto the changes in ticket conditions.\nLondon Transport has indicated its\nwillingness to increase its ticket\nprices even further in the future.\nThe Government has said that any\nof the improvements needed to\nrelieve present overcrowding on the\npublic transport system will also\nhave to be partly funded by fare\nincreases.\nThe future may look bleak...but\nwhat can be done?\nIt is essential for students to become\nmore aware of the changes which\nare threatening their own and future\nstudents chances of education.\nAlready, prospective applicants for\nLondon colleges are reconsidering\nwhether the cost is worth it. Many\nparents will not be able to afford the\nincreased cost of sub sidi sing their\nchildren through higher education.\nThe time of political apathy should\nbe over. The threatened changes are\nimminent and if students do not\nrespond now by demonstrating\ntheir opposition then very soon it is\nlikely to be too late.\nWhilst the Government could be\npersuaded to reconsider some of its\nproposals by mass lobbying and\ndemonstrations it is extremely likely\nthat at least some of the proposed\nchanges will come to pass. London\nstudents must start planning now to\nface the harsher economic\nenvironment, especially when it\ncomes to accommodation. A very\nlarge proportion of the average\nstudent's budget goes directly into\npaying accommodation expenses.\nRented accommodation is little more\nthan living in a long stay hotel. At the end of your stay you have\nnothing to show for the rent paid.\nThe financial benefits of finding\nlow cost accommodation at the\npresent are large and, as has been\npointed out, will probably become\nmuch larger in the future. If you\ncan; start buying your own home.\nIf you can't; read on!\nThere are really two main options\nwhen considering low cost\naccommodation. They are short-life\nhousing usually through housing\ncooperatives and squatting. Rents\nfor short-life housing can be as low\nas \u00a310 per week. The cost of\nsquatting can vary tremendously\ndepending on a variety of factors but\nthe financial incentive is obvious. At\nits best, squatting can provide an\nextended period of rent-free\naccommodation. So what are the\ndrawbacks? We shall consider each\nof the options in turn.\nShort-Life Housing\nThe term 'short-life housing' is used\nto describe property which is being\nborrowed for temporary\naccommodation. Usually the\nproperties involved are owned by\nthe local authority or another public\nbody. Often the local authority is in\nthe process of applying for planning\npermission and it is either waiting\nfor this to be granted or it is waiting\nfor money to become available to\nallow development to start. In the\nmeantime the property is lent to a local housing association or\ncooperative to manage. These\nIC Halls - amongst the most expensive in London\ngroups may also own permanent\nhousing stock that may be any size\nfrom 1-2 houses to a few hundred\nspread over several boroughs.\nAs its name suggests, short-life\nhousing is only available for a short\nperiod, from as little as six months\nto five years. However some short-life properties do get extensions for\neven longer. The conditions of lease\nstate that at the end of the agreed\nlife the property must be handed\nback vacant, to the original owners.\nIn some cases, the owner can take\nback the property earlier by giving\na months notice to the occupiers to\nvacate. Fortunately most short-life\ngroups will do their best to re-house\nyou, should your house be taken\nback.\nShort-life housing varies in standard but don't expect\nconditions to be too good initially.\nDepending on the short-life group\nmanaging the property, repairs will\nbe made to make the house\nadequate. You will usually be\nexpected to decorate and furnish the\nproperty yourself. On the other\nhand the rent is extremely low varying between \u00a310-\u00a320 per week.\nWestminster, one of the most\nexpensive boroughs, has short-life\nproperty available between \u00a315-25\nper week.\n' A Guide to Short-Life Housing in\nLondon' is published by the EP U( the Empty Property Unit, a national\nadvisory service for short-life\ngroups), price \u00a31. It lists all major\nshort-life groups in London, and\ngives a brief account of the present\nsituation in each London borough.\nIt is an essential aid to anyone\nlooking for short-life\naccommodation.\nSeveral of the London colleges\nhave accommodation offices dealing\nwith short-life housing groups, but\nas is the case at Imperial College,\nspaces are limited and so\napplications are often restricted to\nfamilies, overseas students and\npostgraduates, all of whom face\nparticular financial problems over\naccommodation. An exception is\nChelsea College, now part of Kings,\nwhich has about 70 short-life\nproperties in Kensington and Chelsea and elsewhere, housing\nabout 200 students. They are in fact\nthe only short-life group in the\nborough able to obtain property\nfrom the local council. It is unlikely\nthat non-Kings College students\nwould be allowed to apply.\nThe main difficulty in short-life\nhousing is actually getting onto a waiting list. Due to the housing\nshortage and the many homeless\npeople in London, local authorities\nare no longer releasing so many\nproperties to short-life housing\ngroups. Instead they are using them\nfor temporary accommodation to\nfulfill their statutory requirements to\nhouse the homeless, especially\nhomeless families. Consequently\nmany groups are running out of\nnew properties and have closed\ntheir waiting lists. Instead they are\ntrying to re-house their existing\nmembers. Those with waiting lists\nstill open are taking much smaller\nnumbers with the lists re-opening\nirregularly.\nWhen applying to get on a short-life waiting list check that there are\nno restrictions that will affect your\napplication. Many groups will only\ndeal with the homeless. Often you\nwill be given priority if you apply in\na borough where you have\npreviously been resident. It is\nsometimes a good idea to get onto\nthe local council waiting list for a council house, before applying for\na short-life house. If possible put\nyour name on the local electoral\nregister. A connection with the area\nwhich you apply for, such as a job,\nrelatives or the college where you\nstudy can also help a successful\napplicant.\nSingle people are easier to house\nthan groups. In general, if you apply\nas a group then the best size is from\n4-6, preferably mixed. Persistence\ncounts....\nNEXT WEEK: SQUATTING\nFebruary 24 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
