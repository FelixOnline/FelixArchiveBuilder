    "content": "Your sense of smell will guide you in embarking on a pilgrimage to these shrines honouring the fine art of cooking the freshest fish. Well, at least mine did.\nThe streets lined with Turkish Delights\nI\nhave to say that there is no other\ncity like this anywhere else on\nEarth. Being a city which encompasses both Europe and\nAsia really does represent a fusion of east and west, with traditional\nIslamic values standing side by side\nwith those from neighbouring Europe.\nIt is also a harmony of old and new,\nwith a slick new tram system riding\namongst the archaic monuments of the\nmagnificent Hagia Sofia and the Blue\nMosque. Istanbul is fast becoming a\nslick metropolis with every modern\ncomfort, and whilst this city spoils you\nwith every international cuisine you\ncould think of, I\u2019m going to write about\nthe local food which really encapsulates the spirit of this city.\nI\u2019ll start with a Turkish classic, Turkish delight. You\u2019ll find this everywhere,\nand whilst most shops and market stalls\nwill produce those of quality exceeding\nwhat we\u2019d find on our British shores,\nin my opinion, it\u2019s worth checking out\na chain of shops which go by the name\nof Gulluoglu, whose produce will really\nget your tastebuds dancing. Try their\ndouble pistachio delight, whose partnership of pistachio pieces enrobed in\na classically sweet, sugar-dusted jelly\ncreates a wonderful textural balance of\ncrunch and chew. It\u2019s also worth giving\ntheir baklava a try, a pastry-based dessert found throughout Turkey and the\nMiddle East. Turkish baklava differs\nfrom Lebanese baklava in the sense\nthat it is richer and a tad sweeter. (This\nis solid evidence that it is possible to\nload something with more butter and\nsugar than Lebanese baklava). More\nimportantly, it is vital to eat Turkish\nbaklava fresh, for even a few hours on\nthe plane will ensure that their crunch-iness is hastily converted to sogginess.\nA must try is their green diamond\nshaped baklava brimming with pistachio tones.\nDescribing the street food in Istanbul in one word is not easy. Amazing,\ndivine, brilliant, all these words don\u2019t\nquite do it justice. Stroll\naround the tourist or\nnightlife areas and\nyou won\u2019t have\nto walk far for a\ntreat to come to\nyou. In winter,\nfreshly roast-ed, beautifully sweet\nchestnuts are\non display,\nwhereas in\nsummer, a\nslightly chewier version\nof ice cream\nknown as \u2018dondurma\u2019 is a crowd\npleaser. Mussels,\nstuffed with rice and\nherbs are also a must try\nat just 50 cents each. Or try\nthese shell-dwellers in deep fried\nform on a skewer, whose juicy bodies covered in an ever-so-light crispy\nbatter, laden with an aromatic but not\noverpowering garlic sauce, makes for\nan exceedingly mouthwatering com-Chris Sim found that there probably wasn\u2019t enough room in the belly department for all that Istanbul had to offer.\nbination. And then there\u2019s your classic kebabs, where the average doner\nis something truly tasty and far less\ngreasy than what you\u2019d find at your\nlocal kebab house. But something you\nreally cannot afford to miss out on\nis a simple fish sandwich known as\n\u2018balik ekmek\u2019, which can be found in\nEminonu on the European side and\nin Kadikoy on the Asian side. Sold in\nsandwich stalls, they are pretty\nhard to miss, for your nose\nwill be alerted to their\npresence by picking up the sweetly\nseductive whiffs\nof pan-seared\nfish hovering in the air.\nAmazingly\nfresh mackerel (you\ncan even\nsee it being fished\non nearby\nbridges) is\npan fried,\nplaced in a\nwonderfully\nsoft ciabatta-like bread roll,\nwith onions, lettuce\nand lemon juice added\nto it. Fish sandwiches don\u2019t get better\nthan this.\nThe variety of Turkish restaurants\nwill keep you entertained for days on\nend. Gastronauts should pay culinary\nhomage to Ciya Sofrasi in Kadikoy,\nwhere the proprietor (who is known locally as a culinary Indiana Jones) gathers unique flavours from the frontiers\nof Turkey and delivers them straight\nto your plate. Some of their vegetarian options really did stand out, such\nas their stuffed dried vegetables, which\nincorporated eggplant, rice, peppers,\nmint and garlic into a uniquely entertaining combination. Also try some\nof their desserts; their \u2018sobiyet\u2019 (green\nbaklava shaped as triangles) was memorable and their pumpkin dessert was,\nwell, interesting. For a fine dining ex-perience, head to the restaurant inside\nthe Topkapi Palace known as Konyali\nLokantasi, where, whilst the prices\ncould be a tiny bit kinder to your wallet,\nthe quality of their traditional Ottoman\nfood is certainly worth it, particularly if\nyou\u2019re a fan of lamb. If you\u2019d like some\nalcohol with your cuisine then head\nto the side streets off Istiklal Caddesi,\nwhere if you eat in a type of restaurant\nknown as a \u2018meyhane\u2019 you\u2019ll find \u2018meze\u2019\n(small tapas-like dishes) aplenty accompanied by even more \u2018raki\u2019 (an aniseed flavoured spirit).\nA hard day\u2019s eating should be rewarded with some relaxation, so after\nsatisfying your stomach, why not head\ninto Tophane where you can have shisha (known as \u2018nargile\u2019 in Turkey) with\nfriendly locals and enjoy some indulgently sweet pistachio coffee. Or head\nto a hamam, where you can get a traditional Turkish bath and massage.\nI\u2019d recommend Cemberlitas hamami,\nwhose stunning stone baths are the\nperfect setting for a thorough cleaning\nby their firm-handed staff. Just a word\nof warning, such a meticulous cleaning\ncan hurt just a tad. To conclude, this\ncity will not only bring some truly sublime tastes to your palette, it will also\nensure your other senses don\u2019t feel too\nleft out either.\nISTANBUL\u2019S\nFOODIE\nHIGHLIGHTS\nBalik\nEkmek\nWorld\u2019s best\nfish sandwich\nfor two quid\nCiya\nSofrasi\nRestaurant\nwhose chef is\nnot afraid of\nbig, big flavours\nfelixOnline\nFood page\ncoming\nonline soon...\nfelixonline.co.uk\nMussels\nStuffed with\nspicy rice or\ndeep-fried\nwith a garlic\nsauce: cheap,\nomnipresent,\nand cheerful\nCome to think about it, this is actually a student dish.\nIngredients:\nMackerel fillets\nTurkish bread/ Ciabatta\nOlive Oil\nLettuce\nTomatoes\nOnions\nLemon Juice\nCooking procedure, in true Gordon Ramsay style:\n1.

That\u2019s right, once again the\nfragilities of London are brought to a standstill by 2cm of slush,\nas the signs at the cafes read \u2018Closed due to severe weather\u2019.\nAs far as I am aware, coffee machines and till registers still\nfunction when the temperature outside is below zero degrees,\nso during these academically troublesome times, is this drastic\naction to close our caffeine-fuelled refuges really justified? I\nthink not. These cafes were due to close at 4pm anyway (no\ngreat hardship for employees), so was it really so severe that\nstudents be denied a late afternoon pick-me-up? Again, I think\nnot. Undoubtedly most of them travelled home easily by tube\nunaffected by the weather and certainly no different to if they\nhad left at 4pm, apart from the swathe of disgruntled students\nqueuing in the Library for the only hot beverage on campus.\nNo doubt this was a decision made by the powers that be, but\nit would have been nice to see some staff/student solidarity or\nif nothing else some good old British resilience in the face of\nadversity.

Soldiers were told to blink only once\nevery forty seconds, and took precisely 116 steps per minute. All of the Communist Party\u2019s senior members attended, including Chairman Hu Jintao and\nPremier Wen Jiabao.\nThe lavish ceremony was a reminder to the country, and the world, of China\u2019s growing military, political and economic clout. Despite these significant\ngains, China\u2019s leaders still complain that the world has not accepted its emer-gence. Developed countries argue in turn that China has yet to demonstrate\nthat it will accept the responsibility which naturally comes with greater power.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nT\nhe Central American country of Honduras has had a turbulent\nsummer.\nIn the morning of June 28th, following an arrest warrant issued by the Supreme Court, soldiers from the Honduran military\nstormed President Manuel Zelaya\u2019s residence in Tegucigalpa, the capital,\novercame ten presidential guards, bundled Mr. Zelaya into his private jet\nwhile he was still in his pajamas, and sent him into exile in Costa Rica.\nMembers of the Supreme Court and Roberto Micheletti, the Speaker of\nCongress, had deemed Zelaya\u2019s recent attempt at constitutional reform un-constitutional. Zelaya, a supporter of Hugo Chavez\u2019s socialism, was supposedly seeking to run for a third consecutive term as president.\nInternational reaction to the military coup has been almost universally\nnegative, and no foreign government has yet recognised the interim government led by Mr. Micheletti. Since the coup, Zelaya has made several attempts\nto return to power, unsuccessfully trying to land his plane at Tegucigalpa\u2019s\nairport on July 5th, and crossing the border from Nicaragua into Honduras on July 26th, before being forced to turn back by Honduran soldiers.\nOn September 21st, he reappeared in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa,\nprompting a curfew throughout the city, and bringing much of the country\nto a standstill until earlier this week.\nHonduras\nT\nhe discovery of a second uranium enrichment plant near the city\nof Qom in Iran has prompted outrage from international observ-ers, but ensuing talks may turn out to be fruitful, for once.\nThe plant, which can be used for making weapons-usable ura-nium, suggests that Iran, which is also working to produce plutonium, another bomb ingredient, is getting threateningly close to being able to build\nnuclear weapons.\nIn response to the threat, talks have been held in Geneva between Iran and\nsix countries \u2013 the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.\nThese talks also open the first formal, direct negotiations between Iran and the\nUS in three decades. Similar attempts at making Iran relinquish its nuclear ambitions have failed because of a lack of support from Russia and China.\nThis time however, Iran has agreed, in principal, to export much of its stock\nof uranium for processing, and to reveal its new plant to UN inspectors within\na fortnight. Western officials caution that these agreements could still unravel\nduring negotiations over details, but the deals offered the hope that the nuclear\ncrisis could be diffused, at least temporarily.\nIran\nChina\nSir Keith O\u2019Nions has taken over the\nposition of Acting Rector at Imperial\nfollowing the resignation of Sir Roy\nAnderson.

We\u2019re pretty aware of\nthe industry environment that we live\nand work in and we\u2019re trying to react\nto it as it changes. So we don\u2019t have the\nluxury to rely on massive million dollar marketing schemes or young pretty\nfaces. We\u2019re weathered, handsome,\nmusicians that need to give a little to\nget a little. So we give our singles out\nand if you like \u2018em then maybe we see\nyou at shows or maybe you buy the\nrecord - hopefully you wanna help\nus keep making records. Your money\nain\u2019t going to my castle yet. We\u2019re just\ntrying for longevity. I wanna make\nmore records.\nF: Is the video about man(and woman)\nkind\u2019s search for the almighty silver\nfist? (see right - Ed)\nIra: It\u2019s whatever you want it to be my\nman.\nF: How did the group harmonies first\ncome about? would you argue that\nthey\u2019re a focal point of your sound?\nIra: They definitely were for the first\nrecord. The Strokes and Interpol were\nthe archetype when we we recorded\nAll Hour Cymbals. We probably reacted against that as much as we found\ncommon ground with our interests in\ndifferent choral traditions from around\nthe world whether it was Sacred Harp\nSingers or Missa Luba. I think vocal\nand harmonic music was really important for all three of us in our musical\nupbringing and helped inform all of\nour musical vocabulary, whether it was\nbeing turned on by singing along to\nsomething as ubiquitous as the Beatles\nor trying to understand some more\nobscure singing styles from around\nthe world. I think we departed from a\nfocus on choral arrangement on Odd\nBlood but the vocals have remained\na core element. We wanted to give a\nnod to the production techniques of\nsome of the more contemporary popular music that we love and listen to but\nuntil now, hadn\u2019t directly engaged. But\nthat was this album. I don\u2019t want to be\nin a band that casually regurgitates a\n\u2018sound\u2019. We have so many more directions that we can explore. That\u2019s what\nI get off on.\nF:Who\u2019sgotthebestvoiceinthegroup?\nIra: Probably whoever\u2019s giving the in-terview. But I do think that one of our\nstrengths is that we have three distinct\nvocal styles and tones to play with. It\nopens up our ability to play with tam-bour and arrangement that much\nmore. It\u2019s really the benefit of having\nthree instruments as opposed to one.\nF: How did you get involved in the\n\u2018Dark was the Night\u2019 compilation CDs?\nIra: We met the guys from The National when we played back to back\nat a festival in Sweden. A few months\nlater Bryce and Aaron came to us and\nasked if we wanted to be involved with\nthe project. We were surprised to be\nasked, but obviously excited to help\nwith the red hot charity in any way we\ncould. We had played that song live\nsince before the first record was re-leased, so it was a good opportunity to\nfinally get it down.\nAre there any plans to get involved in\nthe same sort of HIV awareness\nwork again?\nF: Are there any other charities or\nmovements that are close to your\nheart?\nIra: I would love to be involved with\na number of charities. The fact of\nthe matter is that we need to attain a\nlittle more success before we can really begin to have the luxury to \u201cgive\nback\u201d. That being said, I think an artist is in a tricky position when it comes\nto bringing awareness to any number\nof issues. Good intentions can sometimes be misconstrued and strong\negos and personalities can take away\nfrom the issue at hand. Other times\nin the most insidious of instances,\nsome people in the public eye use a\ntie to a random charity as a chance to\nwipe their slate clean and clear their\nconscious only to move on and back\nto their life. Of course there are ex-ceptions. But at the base level I am a\nmusician. I am not a politician, and I\nam not an activist. I care deeply about\nmany many issues and I commend\nthose people that devote their entire\nlives to changing things for the better for all of us. I can only hope that\nI make enough money in my life to be\nable to help support those people in\ntheir missions.\nF: Did you record your new album\nlike your debut (both at home and in\nthe studio over a long period of time)\nor was it a much quicker process?\nIra: We spent three months living in a\nhome studio in Woodstock, NY. That\nwas where the lion\u2019s share of the work\nwas done. It was a different experience from the recording of the first album primarily because we had no day\njobs. Our entire job was to make this\nrecord. We had a live work space that\nwas far enough from our loved distractions in Brooklyn, but close enough to\nthem that we could easily get back every week or two. We work pretty slowly\nand have no real set method but that\u2019s\nboth the enjoyment as well as the challenge of it. We revised, arranged and\nthrew things away and started things\nover and beat our heads together until\nwe had some good meat. In May we\ngot out of the studio and played some\nshows while working out some of the\nsongs with our live band. Then we got\nback to a studio in Manhattan to mix\nAlright, you can do this, [exhale], OK steady breathing. Whatever you want it\nto be, whatever you want it to be... [exhale] nope no idea..\nand add some additional recording for\na month.\nF: Was there a conscious attempt to\nmake your music more accessible?\nIra: We had no idea what we we\u2019re doing on our first record. It was total trial\nby fire and we\u2019re still learning. That\n\u201csound\u201d was the sound of a chinese\nknock-off blue mic that \u2018fell off the\nback of a truck\u2019 running straight into\nthe computer with no pre-amp. We\ncorrected all our shortcomings with\nreverb and delay effects and all that\ntranslated somehow into a cohesive\nsound. On the new record we fortunately had the luxury to use a lot more\nequipment so we made a strong effort\nto really be aware of what was the best\ntool to use for each situation. From the\noutset we knew we wanted to make a\nrecord that explored more dance production techniques. When our drums\ngot big, we didn\u2019t want them to sound\nlike a drum circle. We wanted them\nto sound like a slamming singular intelligent robotic fist pounding a hole\nthrough your chest. I love music that\ndoes that; music that makes you dance,\nand we didn\u2019t touch on that on the first\nrecord. There\u2019s also something to be\nsaid for what we want to play live. I\nwant to be able to sweat and watch\npeople dance for the next year and\na half. But hey - if you like that first\nrecord, it will always be there to listen\nto. We don\u2019t have to redo it.\nF: I read that you killed a lot of mice\nwhen you were recording the album,\nare you going to dedicate \u201cOdd Blood\u201d\nto the mice who bravely lost their lives\nin the pursuit of musical excellence?\nIra: There\u2019s nothing brave about something that waits till you\u2019re sleeping to\ncome and steal your food and spread its\ndiseases. Mice have no place in a house\nand they need their necks snapped by\nsnap traps. Throw \u2018em outside \u2018n\u2019 let\nthe cats eat \u2018em.\nThe new album \u201cOdd Blood\u201d is out on\nFebruary 8th on Mute label. You can\nalso download their single \u201cAmbling\nAlp\u201d for free. Just google it.

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\n\u2018I\u2019m the King of the World!\u2019 declared\nJames Cameron after the box-office\nsmashing, Oscar hauling, behemoth\nof a film that was Titanic. With Hollywood wrapped around his little fin-ger, Cameron looked poised to produce many a hit-film from his throne,\nbut quicker than you can say Terrence\nMallick, he disappeared. During the\ndecade-long absence of his highness,\nmany a young pretender has arisen\nto steal his crown, and whilst Michael\nBay and Roland Emmerich\u2019s mediocre\nblockblusters have filled the void, the\nreturn of King Cameron seemed to\nherald the revitalisation of the action\nfilm genre. So just what has JC been\ndoing for the past eleven years? We\nwere promised the biggest revolution\nin cinema history since the Jazz Singer\nand a revolution he has certainly start-ed, just how big it will be, only time\ncan tell.\nAvatar employs a new motion capture technology developed by Cameron and co. that allows the director to\nview the actors\u2019 performances with all\nthe special effects added immediately,\nthus moving CGI closer to conventional filmmaking. However, murmurs\nof discontent were heard as soon as\ndetails of the film emerged. Criticism\nof the \u2018photorealistic\u2019 effects and the\nvery familiar plot were hurled at poor\nJames, even meriting a whole South\nPark episode dedicated to highlighting\nthe similarities to Dances with Wolves\n(smurfs). Interestingly JC didn\u2019t rise to\nthe bait, confident with the knowledge\nthat he had made something special.\nBut has Cameron managed to break\nthe recent trend of directors becoming\ncarried away with CGI and ignoring\nthe real substance of their films? Well\nyes, just about.\nAvatar is spectacular to watch; the\nalien Planet of Pandora is vividly imagined with incredible attention to\ndetail. Fantastic plants and luminous\nflowers populate the dense forests\nwhilst vicious six-legged beasts roam\nthe undergrowth and brightly coloured dragons swoop amongst floating mountains; Salvador Dali would be\nput to shame. What is amazing is that\nevery part of the planet has been rendered on a computer but not once does\nthe environment feel fake. This illusion\nis only slightly shaken by scenes involving the natives of the planet \u2013 the\nNa\u2019vi \u2013 but I attribute this more to the\nfact that we are not used to seeing blue\npeople instead of imperfections with\nthe CGI.\nThe Na\u2019vi resemble Native Americans in most aspects including a spiritual link to nature. But their perfect\nexistence has been threatened with the\narrival of the sky-people, aka humans.\nFar from a dying Earth, a mega-corpo-ration has employed a private army to\nhelp them exploit Pandora\u2019s recources,\nspecifically a rare mineral conveniently named \u2018unobtanium\u2019. The film\u2019s\nhero Jake, a paraplegic ex-marine, is\nenlisted to join the \u2018Avatar Project\u2019 in\nwhich human\u2019s pilot home grown Na\u2019vi\nbodies so they can breath the toxic atmosphere and interact with the locals.\nUnintentionally infiltrating the local\ntribe, Jake\u2019s loyalties slowly switch from\nthe classically unhinged colonel (played\nwith menacing glee by Stephen Lang) to\nthe Na\u2019vi as he falls in love with their way\nof life and also a special lady alien.\nThe latest big discovery, Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation), really\ncomes to life when he\u2019s transformed\ninto his 12 foot alter ego. His portrayal\nof a regression to an almost child-like\nstate due to a new lease of life, in contrast to the depression of being crip-Dry-humping aliens; only in Avatar\npled, is very convincing. Zoe Saldana,\nlast seen in Star Trek, gives the strongest performance of the film as the\nbeautiful but fierce Neytiri, who\u2019s sent\n\u201cBrightly coloured dragons swoop\namongst floating mountains; Salvador\nDali would be put to shame\u201d\ninto a cascading dilemma of conflicting emotions and loyalties. The motion\ncapture technique picks out Saldana\u2019s\nevery subtle movement and expres-sion, helping make Neytiri seem the\nmost human character in the film. I\u2019m\nnot ashamed to say that her Na\u2019vi accent and cat-like actions when angry,\nmake her one of the sexiest characters\nto grace our screen in years.\nFittingly, the central two characters\nare the most developed and help keep\nAvatar focused however, the rest of\nthe cast seemed to have wandered in\nfrom a variety of films. We have the\ngung-ho Colonel Quaritch, who is\nsimply Colonel Kilgore plucked from\nthe horror of \u2018Nam\u2019 in Apocalypse Now\nand thrown into the year 2154. Cameron even shamelessly acknowledges\nthis by placing a mug of coffee in his\nhand during the gunship attack scene\n(only this time, there\u2019s no Wagner).\nWhen you need a macho woman these\ndays, Michelle Rodriguez is top of the\nlist but she struggles with some of the\nweakest lines in the script and her part\nis underused. Sigourney Weaver is reunited with Cameron for the first time\nsince Aliens, her headstrong scientist\nis such a maverick that she smokes in\nspace! And so the list of stereotypes\ngoes on and on...\nBut James Cameron is the first to admit that the plot contains everything\nbut originality. However, avant-garde\nfilms are not his craft and where he excels is in his attention to the structure,\npacing and general tidiness of his films.\nWhen it comes to the story, we are in\ntraditional Cameron territory; a love\naffair interrupted by the inconvenience\nof the threat of death and a finale climaxing with a duel between our hero\nand villain. So the plot may be slightly\ndull but he makes up for this with expert direction; there are no stupid \u2018action\u2019 camera tricks to confuse the audience or repetitive fight scenes which\ntake up half the film. The carefully built\nset-pieces are masterfully handled; expert pacing combined with precisely\nfluctuating levels of suspense ensures\nthat our attention is held throughout.\nMost importantly, at a running time of\nDirector James Cameron\nScreenwriter James Cameron\nCast Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana,\nSigourney Weaver\nRunning Time 162 mins\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nAvatar\nEssential James Cameron\nFilmography\nThe Terminator defined the\n80\u2019s and put Arnie on the map.\nThe special effects were, at the\ntime, cutting edge and Cameron\ncontinued to push the boundaries\nin every one of his subsequent\nfilms. The imaginative action\nscenes combined with visceral\nviolence gave the sci-fi genre a\nmuch needed boost. Arnie said he\nwould be back and he was, with\nthe arguably greater Terminator 2.\nFeminist cinema had always been\nlong winded affairs involving\nstrong willed women who strive\nto be viewed as equals in blah\nblah blah. With Aliens, Cameron\nshowed everyone how to empower\nthe fairer sex: shove a fuck-off\nmassive gun into Sigourney\nWeaver\u2019s hands and let her blow\nthe crap out of dozens of vicious\nxenomorphs. Awesome and\npolitically correct, what else do\nyou want from a film?\n\u201cThough somewhat\nfar-fetched,\ndownloading\nyourself into the\nuniversal conscience\nof the planet and\npraying to a giant\nglowing tree makes\nperfect sense\u201d\n2hrs 40mins, this film is never boring.\nHis screenplays have never pushed\nboundaries but they are usually quite\nsolid. Unfortunately Avatar\u2019s isn\u2019t so,\nand this is where the film falls flat.\nThe weak script is peppered with clich\u00e9s and the dialogue feels unnatural,\npreventing the characters from gaining any emotion depth. This was a big\nshame as I felt the wooden characteri-sation hampered the cast, who would\ntypically have given stronger perform-ances. There\u2019s the Na\u2019vi language to\nconsider as well, of which Cameron\nis apparently very proud, although it\nsoon turns out that it is basically redundant as all the aliens speak English\nanyway. The film\u2019s mythology wisely\nsticks to a familiar fantasy format and\nthus avoids alienating audiences with\ntechnological jargon made infamous\nby the Star Trek films. Though somewhat far-fetched, downloading yourself into the universal conscience of the\nplanet and praying to a giant glowing\ntree makes perfect sense.\nHowever, not even the meanest of\nscrooges will be able to sit sour faced\nthrough the film, grumbling about the\nscript. The sheer magnificence of the\nvisuals will elevate you to a state of ec-stasy, pushing any thoughts of the film\u2019s\nfaults way to the back of your mind.\nBut to experience the film\u2019s maximum\nbeauty I strongly advise seeing it in 3D.\nInstead of being a gimmick, the 3D\nhelps immerse you more into the kaleidoscopic world of Pandora. Ignore\nmy negative criticisms; I\u2019m just being a\nfilm snob and if you haven\u2019t seen Avatar yet then skip your next lecture and\nhead down to the nearest cinema; you\nwon\u2019t be disappointed.\n\n"

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\now 2010 - Our highlights and picks from\nexhibition straight out of the City of Sin\nTalking of Android, the growing maturity of the platform as an operating system\nfor low-end computers and smaller devices was quite obvious at CES, with a slew\nof new Android-packing devices announced. Aside from Google\u2019s own Nexus\nOne \u2018superphone\u2019, announced just before the start of the exhibition, AT&T announced it would carry five new Android handsets this year, with LG and Motorola also announcing new smartphones running the Linux-based OS.\nThe Android story didn\u2019t stop there either, with HP, Dell and Lenovo announcing\nnetbooks and tablet PCs running the system. The emergence of Android at what\nis traditionally a Microsoft stomping ground is very noteworthy. Android could\nprove to be what many die-hard Linux enthusiasts have been waiting for: a widely\nadopted, consumer targeted, open source OS promoted by a major company. With\nat least a dozen new Android products on the way (and more to be announced\nat the Mobile World Congress in February), the OS looks like it\u2019s on the way to\nbe truly competing with Apple and Microsoft for market share across platforms.\nThe quest to make the humble sheet of paper obsolete continues with vigour this\nyear at CES with the launch of yet more e-readers. The main focus for designers\nthis year seems to not be on actually reading books but instead on what else they\ncan do, with many new offerings able to play HD video, synchronise calendars\nand emails and even browse Twitter. Plastic Logic\u2019s QUE proReader pushes the\nenvelope with its broad feature set which also includes opening most Microsoft\nOffice documents, but unfortunately like most e-ink devices on show it suffers\nfrom really sluggish response and loading times. One company with the answer\nto that is display designer Pixel Qi, who comes to CES this year in Notion Ink\u2019s\nimpressive ADAM tablet flaunting a new dual unit that sports a unique LCD that\ncan be either full-colour and backlit or standard monochrome. Oh, and it actually\ngets easier to read in sunlight. The huge advantage of this is the ability to switch\nbetween the two at will, making it easy to view colour images or video and then\nswitch to black and white for text reading that is just as crisp as Amazon\u2019s Kindle\ne-reader, which by now is looking rather long in the tooth.\nAh yes, the iPod dock. Once the must-have gadget for people with too much\nmoney, these glorified speakers now litter the electronics market and nowhere\nmore so than CES. The whole iPod idea hasn\u2019t really changed much since last year,\nso the focus has been on innovation, which, as is typical when creativity is left un-checked, has produced some truly bizarre bits of hardware. This even winds up\nbeing ridiculously impractical in some cases, particularly with Branex\u2019s iTamTam\ndocking stools. Putting aside for the moment that it\u2019s named like a women\u2019s sanitary product, this \u2018funky\u2019 60s-style stool\u2019s docking point is right on the edge of the\nrim making it too easy to sit down and simply snap your iPod in half. Sony\u2019s Trik\nis another offering which is a bit of an odd choice in the design department, being reminiscent of massive 80s boom-boxes that got carried on shoulders. It does\nfeature changeable skins though, and the speakers provide a not-too-shabby 75\nwatts. The true winner of weird this year though goes to Seiko with their \u2018Ocean\nTheatre\u2019 iPod dock. Its main selling point, in addition to the alarm clock and iPod\nattachment, is its ability to project marine life, such as whales and seaweed, onto\nyour wall. If that wasn\u2019t lame enough, it does so with crappy pixelated images and\nat about five frames per second, which puts it on par with about 1980s technol-ogy. What it\u2019s doing at CES 2010 is anybody\u2019s guess.\nUSB 3.0 finally seems to be making its way into consumer electronics, with the\nfirst officially certified USB 3.0 products set to hit shelves later this year. The\nspecification, a fully backwards compatible successor to USB 2.0, makes use of\na noticeably chunkier cable to offer data transfer rates of up to 3.2 Gbits (even\nwith other overheads taken into account), an order of magnitude faster than the\nspeeds USB 2.0 was supposed to provide.\nWhile your standard USB 2.0 cables will still work on these newer ports, you\u2019ll\nbe unable to take advantage of the speed boost - and your new USB 3.0 cables\nwill not work on older ports. Is investing in the new standard worth it? Sony,\nApple and Intel would like you to think otherwise - they have been working on\na completely different technology, dubbed \u201cLight Peak\u201d, that promises to offer\nfaster speeds than USB 3.0 while connecting a much larger range of devices.\nWhether this will be enough to convince consumers to pay for the complete\nwiring overhaul that Light Peak requires is yet to be seen; there are no Light Peak\ndevices due in the near future while USB 3.0 ready laptops from HP will be hitting\nshelves in the coming months.\nUSB 3.0\nlets\neBook readers, but that didn\u2019t keep the tablet\ncourse now that Apple may or may not call their\nblet form factor is getting labelled with the term.\ns press conference with the unveiling of the HP\nstage, showing off Windows and the PC Kindle\nand can even play games of a sort with Ballmer\nhe audience. Look for this one hitting the shelves\nIdeaPad U1 Hybrid. The clue\u2019s in the name but\nparty piece in the form of a detachable resistive\nmbo device harbours an Intel CULV processor\nremium, pretty standard fare. The unusual thing\nowered by a separate Snapdragon CPU running\nok OS. Pull out the slate, switch over to Skylight\nat CES in the form of the ICD Vega 15-inch\nchipset and running a heavily customised build\nhe family market. In reality what that means is\nshared calendars, SMS/MMS messaging and a\nks WiFi, an FM radio, on-demand TV and 1080p\nn is only 1366x768. Pricing and availability have\nbscription to be involved.\nmily computing and we\u2019ll even get it in the UK!\nAndroid eReaders\niPod Docks\nCould this be the one cable to rule them all or is Light Peak going to kick ass?\nCareful where you sit, it could be expensive.\nGoogle\u2019s Android powered \u2018superphone\u2019 the Nexus One.\nThe QUE makes Amazon\u2019s Kindle look like a not-so-cheap plastic toy.\n\n"

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nChagas disease kills more Latin Americans than Malaria, so why do so few\npeople know of its existence? It is endemic in 21 countries across South and\nCentral America, and is increasingly\nbeing seen in the US, Europe and Japan in migrant populations. It is a silent killer with millions unknowingly\ninfected.\nCaused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the symptoms of Chagas\ncan lie dormant for many years. In\nthe chronic stage (developed by 25-30% of the infected) Chagas causes\nirreversible heart and gastrointestinal damage. The two available drugs\nagainst the disease were developed 35\nyears ago (in investigations not aimed\nat Chagas) and there has been very\nlittle focus on research and develop-ment. The laboratory manufacturing\nNifurtimox (one of two drugs avail-able) is no longer marketing the drug,\nonly donating limited supplies. This is\njustified by claiming a lack of demand\nfor the drug, but Chagas affects an\nestimated 14 \u2013 16 million people and\nkills 20,000 to 50,000 every year. The\ndrugs also cause unpleasant side effects which are common in patients,\nmeaning that many sufferers do not\ncomplete their course of treatment.\nOne hundred years\nof anonymity. Happy\nanniversary...\nEmily Clifford\nEmily Clifford Frustratingly, 80% of cases are transmitted by a vector (an insect, shown\nbelow) that lives in the walls of rural\ndwellings made from basic materials,\nmaking Chagas a disease of poverty.\nAlthough in many Latin American\ncountries there are prevention programs involving pest control, these\nare expensive and are currently not\neffective enough to eliminate the dis-ease. Transmission can also be blood\nborne, from mothers to children or\nthough transfusions/organ transplan-tation, making this a disease that could\nbe seen globally. Although a screening test has been approved for use in\nNorth America, not all blood banks\nscreen for T. cruzi. With up to 50% infection in blood banks of some cities\nin South America, and increasing migration out of Latin America, you have\nto wonder how soon it will be before\npeople start contracting the disease in\nwestern countries.\nSimply put, Chagas seems to be a disease in which, pharmaceutical companies have little interest, endemic governments deem unimportant, and the\ndiseased have little knowledge. Why?\nI cannot help but wonder whether an\nincrease in cases in the more verbal\nwestern world eventually sparks an\ninterest in Chagas? And if so, what\nwould that say about current attitudes\ntowards the affected?\nCause and effect: the assassin (or kissing) bug responsible for Chagas disease\n(above) and a girl with an acute form of the disease (below)\nImperial College is renowned for its\nscientific prowess and a student\u2019s keenness to succeed by whatever means\nnecessary, and this was no doubt exemplified on the night of Thursday\n27th November 2009. Following the\nsuccesses of PotMed, ISCMSU Muslim\nMedics embarked on a new journey\nby holding a symposium to signify the\nhard work and dedication of a typical medical BSc student. In front of a\npacked out audience, these presenters\nfought tooth and nail to ensure they\nwere crowned winner of Young Scientists\u2019 Symposium 2009.\nIn its third year running, YSS grew to\na somewhat unprecedented level this\nyear. A lot of interest for presentations\non various scientific topics was generated and this was further highlighted\nwith the adjudicators present on the\nday. Dr Steve Gentleman, reader in\nNeuropathology, and an old advisory\nfrom the first YSS, was kindly joined\nby Dr Kevin Murphy (lecturer in Gastroenterology) and Miss Noor Jawad\n(the winner of the previous YSS). In\naddition, it was an immense honour to\nwelcome the Deputy Principal of the\nFaculty of Medicine and previous head\nof the National Heart and Lung Institute, Professor Sir Anthony Newman.\nThe judges were accompanied by the\naudience, composed of invited sixth\nformers and Imperial students from all\nyear groups.\nOne of the aims of the night was to\ncreate excitement about science and\nresearch in general, especially within\nthe younger community. This was fulfilled by astonishing the audience on\nthe importance of research in various\nmedical professions from cardiovascular sciences to endocrinology. Tailoring\nthe advanced research to an audience\nof teenagers presented the first chal-lenge. In addition, the art of delivering\na speech to the respected panel was in\nfact probably the defining feature of\nYSS, and it was through such coherent\nyet scientifically astute methods that\nthe victor was selected. The victor did,\ncoincidentally, make a thoroughly well\nreceived joke about Viagra!\nAt this moment, it is important to\nillustrate the exemplary nature of Imperial students by not only having the\nconfidence to present but in one particular case, having the ability to be\nunnerved by the occasion and chairing the whole affair. Aamir Shamsi, a\nco-ordinator for YSS, welcomed many\nhis seniors in a confident and insightful manner. It is this self-assurance that\nis undoubtedly present in many of our\ncolleagues, which will hopefully take\nus places around the world.\nGiving \u2018power to the people\u2019 this year\ncame in the form of an audience vote;\nawarding Mohammed Al-Hairi a prize\nafter he an interesting talk regarding psychological morbidity amongst\nmental health staff i.e. the mental\nhealth of mental health staff. But, the\nmain prize of the day was awarded to\nZubair Sarang, a 5th year medic, who\ndelivered a captivating presentation on\nthe role of endothelium-derived nitric\noxide on the development of aortic\nvalve calcification, which could have\nimplications when designing tissue engineered heart valves.\nImperial has once again succeeded\nin creating scientific aptitude, but I\nbelieve there is a sting in the tail, and\none that I feel that should be under-lined. For all the successes, it is very\napparent that there is failure when it\ncomes to how students succeed. Like\nI said earlier, students will often fight\ntooth and nail in order to accomplish\ntheir goals. They will let nothing stand\nin their way, be it getting published or\nwinning a prize, and often use tactics\nto get ahead of their peers and col-leagues. You can\u2019t just be ordinary at\nImperial, you have to show that you\u2019re\nahead of the game, when in fact trying\nto be ahead of the game is just part of\nthe norm. Other peoples\u2019 work and\nachievements should be respected\nand appreciated, not just looked at\nand despised. But maybe this can be\nregarded as a success in itself as it allows students to prosper into their\nown niche, whereby everyone is good\nat something. This constant reminder\nthat you have to be of use, might actually encourage students to take part in\nuniversity life and achieve the unach-ievable. Who knows?\nYoung Scientists\u2019 Symposium was\ndefinitely a success, as illustrated by a\nmember of the audience, who thanked\nMuslim Medics \u2018for organising such\nan inspirational event,\u2019 (with a little\nsmiley face at the end if I may add). It\nwas a pleasure seeing so many young\nstudents genuinely interested in sci-ence, and hopefully this shall continue\nin years to come. However, this notion\nof fair-play should never be forgotten\nand everyone\u2019s achievements should\nbe recognwised.

A single guy\nis discovered with\n(potentially) explosive underpants and now millions of\npounds of taxpayers\u2019 money is being\nspent on full body scanners in airports.\nInitially, there was a fuss over liquids,\nwhich are still banned until 2011. Presumably someone somewhere in the\nworld was discovered with a bottle of\nliquid which was apparently part of a\nwider bomb plot. As a result of that,\nmillions of travellers not only have to\nendure excessively long queues but are\nleft baffled every day when their bottles of juice and plastic bags are confiscated by security personnel. Terrorists\naround the world must be rubbing their\nhands together gleefully at the thought\nof the millions of pounds we\u2019ve been\nforced to spend on largely meaningless and useless crap every time there\u2019s\neven a whiff of suspected terrorist\nactivity. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the\nterrorists who plotted the daring underpants raid had shares in these body\nscanner producing companies.\nI mean, what\u2019s the big fuss over any-way? When the daring underpants raid\nunravelled, news stations worldwide\nwere reporting the plain and simple\nfacts \u2013 that some Nigerian radical had\ntried and failed to blow himself (and\nothers) up on Christmas Day. In the\nUK though, our newspapers had to\npoint out his time at UCL as if that fact\nwas somehow related, almost as if he\nwas radicalised during his time in the\nUK. Once again, freedom of speech\nin universities came under fire, if but\nbriefly, even though universities quite\nsimply don\u2019t create extremists. It\u2019s\nridiculous to say that Cambridge is\nsomehow responsible for Nick Griffin or that David Irving, who wrote for\nfelix while at Imperial, was radicalised\nduring his time here. However, we cannot possibly ignore the fact that a graduate engineer has failed to blow himself up. I mean, what kind of a graduate\nengineer cannot even blow himself\nup? How can we possibly continue to\nadvertise our world class education? I\nbelieve an immediate enquiry should\nbe made into the academic standards\nof UCL.\nComing back to the full body scanners I mentioned earlier, well, there\nhave now been some pretty pointless attacks on this technology on the\ngrounds that it is now a threat to child\nrights. The images can apparently be\nclassed as child pornography so everyone under the age of 18 cannot be\nscanned on this legal technicality. As\nI see it, government is going to find a\nway around this. As an added bonus,\nthe hysteria of the child protection\nagencies, in pointing this out, have just\npossibly rather ironically encouraged\nchild perverts to queue up for these\njobs at airports \u2013 getting their rocks off\non these images. So, the safety of our\nchildren has just been further compro-mised. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m\nvery much against these new scanners\nanyway because I feel they\u2019re a pointless waste of money to placate irrational public fears. If you\u2019re too much\nof a paranoid grapefruit to fly because\nof those laughable terrorists, then by\nall means leave the skies to those with\nenough backbone and self-respect to\nsay no to the ridiculous measures taken in the name of anti-terrorism.\nMy point is that the attack on body\nscanners on the basis of some kind\nof a pervert charter is quite frankly\nsilly. Child protection groups seem\nconcerned that a child\u2019s genitalia will\nshow up in these full body scans. How\nerotic... Why are they not equally concerned if some kid turns up in A&E\nand has to get an x-ray of that region\nbecause some other kid has kicked him\nin the balls in the playground during\nbreak time? Surely it\u2019s all about how\nthe images are used \u2013 I mean, if you\nbrowse through a catalogue of kids\nswimsuits, that\u2019s fine but if you have\na scrapbook of thousands of images\nof kids in swimsuits, then I wouldn\u2019t\nbe surprised if you were prosecuted\nfor being a weirdo. Isn\u2019t it time that we\nstood up to these terrorists instead of\noverreacting? What the hell happened\nto British backbone, or are we still going to run to mummy every time.\nChengZhangcongratulatestheworldofterrorism\n\u201cLeave the skies to\nthose with enough\nbackbone ... to say\nno to the measures\ntaken in the name\nof anti-terrorism.\u201d\nF\nirstly, welcome to 2010!\nPlease wipe your feet.\nLast year, nothing much\nhappened. Specifically, representatives from all the\ncountries of the earth met in Copenhagen, argued back and forth about Climate Change for ten days and then...\nnothing. An \u201cagreement\u201d that not everyone agreed on. Bravo!\nAnd this was a shame as global warming seems like an important issue.\nI\u2019m not too fussed on it myself but it\nbugs me how it has transformed the\nstate of the weather into a valid topic\nof conversation. \u201cSo what\u2019s with this\nweather?\u201d is supposed to be a last ditch\nattempt at communication, usually after the catastrophic revelation of one\u2019s\npolitical or sexual preferences. With\nit now taking the keynote position of\nafter-dinner chitter-chatter, how can\nwe possibly hope to shatter the silence\nimposed by \u201cActually, I find Nick Griffin in suspenders quite attractive\u201d?\nI can deal with the floods, the frosts\nand the fires (coming this summer to\na forest near you...) but I will not sit\nback and watch as the bedrock of polite conversation is eroded before our\neyes. Accordingly then, I have devised\na few measures which should put global warming back in its place, in the\ndarkest recesses of late night chit-chat.\nThey say that an area of rainforest equal\nto Belgium is cut down every year. This\nobviously has a considerable impact on\nthe environment. My suggestion is that\nwe cut down Belgium instead. Surely\nno-one will miss it. Goodness knows\nthe atmosphere doesn\u2019t need all that\nhot air from Brussels! However, this\nbarely scratches the surface.\nCows are a much bigger problem than\nBelgium. Agriculture contributes\nabout 14% of the world\u2019s greenhouse\ngases, which is nothing to be sniffed\nat. What\u2019s more, a significant portion\nof these emissions is methane, which\nis twenty times more potent that CO2\n,\nand a single cow, through the most\nignominious of farts and burps, will\nproduce 300 litres of the stuff a day.\nIt\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a bigger threat\nto the environment than even Jeremy\nClarkson.\nSo what can we do? I originally planned\na mass corking program but preliminary studies showed that the cows had\na tendency to explode. Doctors like\nto term this an \u201cadverse event\u201d and is\nsomething best avoided. I went back\nto the drawing board, but not before\npassing the cork cow-exploder idea\non to the Ministry of Defence. (France\nwon\u2019t know what hit it!)\nThere are more than 1.5 billion cows\nin the world. That\u2019s more than the entire population of China \u2013 and, for the\nrecord, China is massive! \u201cBut why do\nwe need so many cows?\u201d, I pondered\nover a beefburger in the Union. \u201cYou\neat them all,\u201d my friend retorted, \u201cIf we\nwere all vegetarians, we wouldn\u2019t need\nso many cows and could reduce their\nbeefy burpy emissions.\u201d \u201cBut cows\nare vegetarians \u2013 in fact, they only\neat grass,\u201d I argued, \u201cand they\u2019re the\nproblem!\u201d But this got me thinking. If\nvegetarianism isn\u2019t the answer, maybe\ncarnivorism is!\nSo, there are too many cows. Cows are\nvegetarians. If we could get cows to eat\nother cows, we would have fewer cows.\nFewer cows are good! Q.E.D. But how\nto do it? I\u2019m all for a bit of sirloin but\ncows, for reasons unfathomable, don\u2019t\nseem too inclined to take the bait. We\nneed to make cows more palatable to\nother cows. Therefore, I propose that\nwe paint the cows of Britain with MSG,\nto enhance and accentuate their natural flavour. It doesn\u2019t hurt either that\nMSG is the one thing more addictive\nthan crack cocaine.\nYou may scoff but this plan is so mad,\nit\u2019s brilliant. There are 10 million cows\nin Britain, all of which need painting\nwith MSG. And 3 million workers will\nneed 3 million buckets and brushes,\nnot to mention the gallons of MSG re-quired, and all the sundries beside. The\npurchase of these goods will revitalise\nthe economy and stimulate growth\nfaster than ProPlus snorted off a \u00a35\nnote.\nThat is how we fix global warming and\nthe economy in one fell swoop. Everybody\u2019s happy, except The Daily Mail,\nwhich, by definition, is never happy.\nRhysDavies\u2019viewonglobalwarming\n\u201c...this plan is so\nmad, it\u2019s brilliant...\n10 million cows in\nBritain, all of which\nneed painting with\nMSG.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk MUSIC\nSo while you guys were snowed in this Christmas, Kadhim Shubber chatted to Al Doyle about the new album\nHot Chip\u2019s One Life Stand out in Feb\nKadhim: The new album sounds less\nbrash than your previous records, it\u2019s a\nlittle more laid back.\nAl Doyle: It\u2019s been a little strange\nhearing the responses that we\u2019ve been\ngetting to the album. The very first interview that we did was with Pitchfork\nand they kept saying how low-key the\nalbum is which confused us a little.\nK: That wasn\u2019t what you guys were\naiming for I guess.\nAl: We\u2019re all about making music that\npeople can dance to but we\u2019ve always\nhad a different idea about what constitutes a groove. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve\never been brash but it\u2019s a good word\nbecause what some people call electro\nthese days is just brash noise, a sort\nof repetive annoying noise, there\u2019s no\nother way to describe it. But that\u2019s not\nthe kind of music that we\u2019ve ever wanted to make.\nK: You seemed to have dropped the\nheavier guitar elements that you had in\n\u201cMade in the Dark\u201d. Was there a specific reason for that?\nAl: We were experimenting with that\nduring recording and the rehearsals\nwe\u2019re doing now but it didn\u2019t fit, we felt\nlike we didn\u2019t really need it.\nK: The album feels a lot less silly than\nsome of the stuff you\u2019ve released be-fore, it sounds like the band\u2019s a lot\nmore comfortable with themselves.\nAl: It\u2019s true, we don\u2019t have any tracks\nlike \u201cShake a fist\u201d from the previous al-bum. I think it\u2019s a synthesis of what\u2019s\ncome before. There are some songs,\nwell actually the two that have been released so far, One Life Stand and Take\nIt In, that you might call archetypal\nHot Chip songs. Ultimately you\u2019ve got\nthe pop song structure, verse, bridge,\nchorus but we\u2019ve tried as usual to inject some strangeness, to make it more\ninteresting. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve changed\nour formula too much but our execution has definitely improved.\nK: The whole thing feels more like a\ncomplete record as well.\nAl: Our previous albums I think\nworked well as collections of songs but\na lot of the feedback that we got was\nthat people were confused as to why\nwe moved around so much stylistically.\nI don\u2019t think that many artists would\ntake that on board but we challenged\nourselves to create something more\ncohesive.\nK: The songs on this album sound like\nthey come from a deeper place emo-tionally, I\u2019m really enjoying \u201cBrothers\u201d but compared with say \u201cWrestler\u201d,\nthere\u2019s something different going on.\nAl: [laughs] I think Wrestler is probably the most specific song that we\u2019ve\never written but I\u2019m glad that you like\n\u201cBrothers\u201d because it would probably\nbe a pastiche of a love song if there\nwasn\u2019t genuine emotion behind it.\nK: Keeping on that idea, where does\nthe impulse to juxtapose upbeat melodies with more melancholy lyrics come\nfrom? For example, the Wiley cover\nthat you did made \u201cWearing My Rolex\u201d\nsound heartfelt.\nAl: We ended up making it sound\nlike he\u2019s upset about losing his rolex\n[laughs]. But more seriously, it\u2019s a tradition in a lot of genres. You look back\nto Motown and Gospel music from\nthe South and move through Chicago\nand Detroit and the house music coming out from there; the same feeling is\nthere. The music can be upbeat, and\neven the lyrics can be uplifting but it\nretains a depressing quality. It\u2019s not a\nmagic trick but the interplay definitely\ncreates something interesting for the\nlistener, which is why we like to do it\nand which is why it\u2019s quite common\nthroughout a lot of genres. It gives the\nlistener something deeper to come\nback to, instead of the kind of songs\nyou get from the Sugababes.\nK: There\u2019s one song specifically from\nthe album that I wanted to talk about. I\nwas a bit surprised when I listened to \u201cI\nFeel Better\u201d because it sounds like the\nkind of music that you hear on the RnB\nclub scene.\nAl: We deliberately wanted to make\nthat kind of song, we thought it would\nbe funny to jump on the auto-tune\nbandwagon but waaayyyy late. But the\nlyrics for most of the song are quite\ndark which I think contrasts well with\nthe type of song it is, but when we got\nto the chorus we thought we\u2019d go all\nout and use the most clich\u00e9d dance\nlyrics we could imagine. I guess it\u2019s just\nanother play with the idea of contrast,\nbetween verse and chorus, major and\nminor chords in that song.\nK: You\u2019re touring with The xx in the\nU.S. for a short while this March, are\nyou a fan of theirs?\nAl: Well I don\u2019t know their music very\nwell, I don\u2019t have their album but I\u2019ve\nbeen listening to some of their songs\nquite a bit recently and I really enjoy it.\nWe wanted to put together a really exciting bill and they\u2019re getting quite big\nin the U.S. so it\u2019s worked out quite well.\nK: In your wildest dreams, who would\nyou want to tour with? And you can\u2019t\nchoose LCD Soundsystem.\nAl: I guess you\u2019ve got to think about\nwho would be most fun to tour with\nso you\u2019ve got to go way back for that,\nmaybe the Happy Mondays? It was\nquite cool a few years back because\nNeil Young was playing the same festivals in Australia that we were, which\nwas kind of like touring with him. It\nwas nice seeing Neil Young every day.\nK: Everyone at the moment is giving\ntheir recommendations for artists to\nlook out for in 2010, have you got any?\nAl: There\u2019s this artist that Felix and\nI are producing called \u201cPlanning to\nRock\u201d. The girl\u2019s name is Janine Rostron and she\u2019s done some work with\nThe Knife as well. We always mention\nas well, Grovesnor. The guy\u2019s name is\nRob Smoughton, he\u2019s actually drumming for us on our upcoming tour.\nTheir both pretty great, check them\nout.\nK: Do you ever find that it\u2019s difficult to\njuggle your commitments to Hot Chip\nand LCD Soundsystem?\nAl: I do actually, I\u2019m having to miss out\non the tour this year. I\u2019m doing some\nrehearsals with them so I might be able\nto join them later on in the year but it\nhasn\u2019t been decided yet so it\u2019s a bit shit.\nThis collaboration between skinny\nindie pop and one of Britain\u2019s most\ninteresting rappers almost, almost\nworks. The first minute or so, where\nRoots Manuva raps over the dark ambience of The Maccabees single \u201cNo\nKind Words\u201d is convincing but then\nyou realise that there\u2019s been almost no\nremixing at all and you\u2019re just listening\nto The Maccabees. I don\u2019t dislike them\nbut this \u2018remix\u2019 doesn\u2019t add very much.\n- Kadhim Shubber\nShearwater manage to attain a medieval atmosphere to their music without\nthe mindless cacophony and mum-blings of bands like Sons of Noel and\nAdrian. They make unobtrusive use of\nthe bongo drums and at times begin to\nhit the seamlessness that made Fleet\nFoxes debut so appealing. The songs\naren\u2019t particularly \u201chooky\u201d so you\u2019ve\ngot to put some effort in. This album\nis unlikely to reward the disinterested\nlistener. - Kadhim Shubber\nSHEARWATER\nTHE GOLDEN\nARCHIPELAGO\nMATADOR\nALBUM\nTHE MACCABEES\n(FEAT ROOTS\nMANUVA)\nEMPTY VESSELS\nFICTION\nSINGLE\nFYFE\nDANGERFIELD\nFLY YELLOW\nMOON\nPOLYDOR\nALBUM\nCHARLOTTE\nGAINSBOURG\nIRM\nBECAUSE/\nELEKTRA\nALBUM\nThe first solo effort from the Guillemots\u2019 front-man was always going to\nbe unpredictable. The album opens\nwith a bang, with a track that sounds\nlike Paolo Nutini having a wrestling\nmatch with the Scissor Sisters but the\nrest of the album is stripped back to a\nbare minimum, which allows his skills\nas a songwriter to shine.

This comes after students\nused past assessments to gain what the\nBiology department deemed an unfair\nadvantage.\nStudents are up in arms as the department tries to blame the students\nfor contravening course regulations,\nbut the department has been heavily\ncriticised for not producing new questions for graded coursework assessments each year.\nThe majority of students on the\nmandatory Applied Molecular Biology (AMB) module have found their\ncoursework marks severely downgraded after three completed and submitted coursework assessments were\nremoved from the syllabus with immediate effect.\nAfter marks for these grades suddenly disappeared from Blackboard,\nthe department\u2019s intranet system, staff\nsent out an email to all second year\nstudents on 21st December justifying\nthe removal. It stated there was \u201cunequivocal evidence of widespread plagiarism\u201d and on Registry\u2019s advice they\nwere voiding the given grades for two\nProblem Based Learning practicals\nand another online assessment.\nProblems for the Biology department started when students did the\nobvious thing when it comes to exams\nand used last year\u2019s questions and answers to help them revise for the three\nmultiple-choice question tests. Combined they were originally worth 50%\nof the module\u2019s coursework mark, but\nweighting has since dramatically been\nadjusted.\nStudents who were genuinely using\npast years\u2019 assessments as a revision-aid were pleasantly surprised to find\nout that all three tests used recycled\nquestions from previous years.\nAMB assessments took place\nthroughout the module\u2018s duration\nwhich was convened for 6 weeks from\nthe start of the academic year in October. Students have been flooding\nRecycled questions rile students\nthe discussion forums on Blackboard\nsince they arrived back at College for\nthe new term.\nOne student wrote: \u201cGrades change\nsignificantly [sic] for some of us who\ndidn\u2019t cheat and this is totally unfair.\u201d\nThe dramatic drop in percentage\nmark for many of the affected students was caused when only nine\nquestions from all three assessments\nwere deemed except from the retrac-tion. The nine questions were the only\nfresh questions used for this year, and\nnow disproportionately equate to a\ndecreased 25% of the Applied Molecular Biology coursework. One biologist\nwas astonished at his new percentage\nmark.\n\u201cI went from a 2:1 to a fail! 25% of\nthe coursework can make or break the\nfinal module grade at the end of the\nyear.\u201d\nAs felix spoke to biologists in the\nSir Alexander Fleming Building, they\nwere mostly annoyed at their department\u2019s behaviour during this debacle.\n2nd Year Biology Representative\nAlan Itakura said \u201cI think the students\nfeel there is a general lack of concern\nfor their well-being from the biology\nstaff. The decision to revoke the marks\nwas not well thought out. There is no\nreason that new questions cannot be\nmade every year for each assessment,\nand if, for whatever reason, that new\nquestions are not made,\nthere is no\nAdam Freeman\nAdam Freeman News Reporter\nLord Mandelson, Secretary of State\nfor Business, Innovation and Skills has\nannounced a \u00a3398 million budget cut\nfor UK universities for the 2010/2011\nfinancial year. The prominent Lord\nhas also asked universities to protect\nthe quality of, and access to, higher\neducation.\nLord Mandelson has further stated\nthat last year\u2019s U-turn on extra places\nwas \u201cresponding to the particular\nneeds of the time\u201d and will not be repeated in 2010-11. Universities are given quotas for the maximum number of\nhome students that they are allowed to\nadmit each year to each department,\nand Lord Mandelson says some have\nrecruited more than their share. \u00a33,700\nper student will be reclaimed in each\nsuch case, which the million+ group of\nuniversities estimates will cost \u00a360m\noverall.\nDavid Willetts, who shadows Lord\nMandelson commented that \u201cwe now\nhave the bizarre situation that universities are being fined for meeting\ntargets set by this government\u2026unlike the government we don\u2019t believe\nin artificial targets. Our view is that\nhigher education should be available\nto all those who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and\nwho wish to do so.\u201d One reason for the\nsurge in demand for university places\nis thought to be lack of paid employment opportunities for young people\nin the current climate.\n\u201cAreductioninthepublicfundingper\nstudent could seriously threaten our\nability to offer the high-quality experience our students deserve and expect,\u201d\nsaid Professor Steve Smith, president\nof Universities UK, an organisation for\nUK university vice-chancellors.\nHowever, Higher Education Minister\nDavid Lammy defended the cuts say-ing, \u201cthis government recognises that\na high quality student experience with\nexcellent teaching and research is vital\nto maintaining the world-class higher\neducation we enjoy in this country\ntoday. Fast-track, part-time and two-year degrees do not represent a reduction in quality in the higher education\noffer, but an increase in choice for the\nwould-be learner\u2026it was not a question of whether efficiencies should be\nmade, but of where the efficiencies\nshould be found.\u201d\nThe cuts include \u00a384 million from\nbuildings and equipment, and \u00a351\nmillion from teaching. However, a\npromise of a \u00a3109 million increase in\nresearch funding will be kept.\nThe government is also planning to\ntry out two-year bachelor\u2019s degrees as\na way of reducing costs and appealing\nto a wider range of backgrounds.\nMeanwhile, Scotland\u2019s SNP Government has promised a real terms increase of 2.1% in its universities budget.\nSinaAtaherian\nSinaAtaherian Business Editor\nUnion Building vandalised for upteenth time\nImperial College Union\u2019s main building in Beit Quadrangle has been subject to unlawful entry and vandalism\nonce again. The latest occurrence happened out of term time on the 22nd of\nDecember at around 2.25am.\nSecurity staff found a cabinet in the\nSnooker Club\u2019s allocated room to be\ndefaced and damaged. A snooker table was also found to be covered in\nan energy drink given free to clubs\nand societies.\nThis break-in is in a long line of\nattempts to enter the Union Building with criminal intent.\nIn the two weeks leading up to November 17th 2009, the Union Building\nwas damaged six times by unknown\nassailants, which included the removal\nof doors from their hinges and multiple panes of glass smashed.\nLast year, the Union offices were burgled on several occasions and several\nitems of considerable expense were\nstolen.\nWith previous counts, circumstances have been hazy regarding how and\nwho was involved, and once again the\nUnion\u2019s security lapses have created a\nshocking amount of uncertainty to this\nround of vandalism that will undoubtedly cost the Union to rectify.\nSecurity staff have indicated that\npoorly positioned CCTV footage\nmerely shows the top of the guilty party\u2019s heads as they escaped out of the\nUnion\u2019s rear exit, and hence is useless.\nThey also stated that the police have\nbeen informed but are yet to follow up\non the initial report.\nAccess was gained via the East entrance door that leads to the Union\nBar and eastern stairwell. The door is\nleft unlatched out of working hours to\nprovide local bus drivers access to the\ntoilet facilities during the night.\nThis seemingly naive procedure was\neasily taken advantage of and led to the\nsnooker room\u2019s vandalism.\nUnion President Ashley Brown has\nsince confirmed that College are \u201cunderway with a security review\u201d of the\nUnion, and are \u201cin the process of getting quotes for more CCTV cameras\nand card readers.\u201d\nIn light of CCTV\u2019s failure, it looks\nlike an old-fashioned crime-solving detective like Sherlock Holmes is needed.\nfelix is sure he could make much\nmore out of the comical Digestive\nbiscuit-crumb trail left from the East\nstairwell to the snooker rooms and out\nagain.\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\ntober.

Phases 1 & 2 have been relatively\ndull for the average student; phase 1 saw\na new lift and dodgy wiring being fixed\nin the union and phase 2 was responsible for the union offices and the student activities centre being moved up a\nfew floors and a new gym in the union.\nPhase 3 is set to be completed in time\nfor freshers week 2010 and includes\nmajor changes to the area dearest to\nstudents\u2019 hearts; the bar! The union bar\nis likely to be largely unchanged; neat-ening up the floor and ceiling as well as\ninstalling air conditioning.\nMeanwhile, Da Vinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s both\nlook set for a radical overhaul; regarding the current configuration of the\nbars Ashley told felix: \u201cThe problem\nwith da Vinci\u2019s is that it\u2019s just too nar-row, the lino floors are horrible and\nthe catering area is a complete waste\nof space in the evening, reducing the\nuseable length of the bar.\u201d When asked\nabout the furniture in da Vinci\u2019s, introduced in a minor refurbishment in\n2006, Ashley agreed they\u2019re not really\nfit for purpose and are far less robust\nthan hoped- the tendency for legs to\nfall off the tables isn\u2019t ideal. However\nhe maintained the considerations behind the furniture are still valid: \u201cfurniture in da Vinci\u2019s needs to be robust,\nperhaps the style should be more\nlike what\u2019s currently in dB\u2019s, but with\nlonger tables so that a whole team can\ngather around one and the furniture\nshould survive outside use, making the\nspace more flexible.\u201d One suggestion\nfor solving the problem of the unsociable shape of da Vinci\u2019s is to knock out\nthe current catering space changing\nthe configuration to increase efficiency\nand improve the layout of the bar.\nICU\u2019s \u2018club\u2019 dB\u2019s suffers from a poor\nlayout which makes it difficult to reach\nAlice Rowlands\nAlice Rowlands Reporter\nDamage to the Union over two weeks: 1. 1st Floor rear office doors, 2. dBs toilets, 3. Union Office door (Floor 2), 4. Da Vinci\u2019s internal door, 5. Main entrance window, 6. Union Bar door\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nMISSING\nPERSON\n1\nthe bar and therefore uninviting to the\ncasual drinker. As part of an effort to\nmake dB\u2019s a more inviting entertaining\nspace, the entire quad is likely to be remodelled and the popular awnings re-positioned in order to make better use\nof covered outside space.\nInitial plans for phase 3 were produced when work began in 2006, the\nUnion realise this refurbishment is a\nmassive undertaking which can only\nbe done every fifteen years or so it\u2019s\nessential to get it right. Temporary, ill-planned solutions have resulted in the\ncurrent poor use of space, so the Union are consulting professional designers and students on how best to use the\nspace.\nMajor work to da Vinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s will\nset the Union back around \u00a32 million,\nTuesdays meeting left Ashley confirmed the project will go ahead with\nfunds raised between College, Union\nreserves and a loan to the Union from\ncollege, meaning the Union are happy\npress ahead with plans for phase 3.\nExcitement over plans for phase\n3 has been somewhat soured by\nevening revelry resulting in around\n\u00a32000 worth of damage to the Union\nbuilding over the last two weeks. Last\nWednesday several panes of glass\nin ground floor doors and windows\nwere broken and a door to the Union offices was damaged, on Friday\nnight the door to the toilet in dB\u2019s\nwas pulled off its hinges and this\nWednesday a door near to the Ladies\ntoilets was damaged to the point that\nit will be completely replaced. Talking\nabout the recent damage, Ashley told\nfelix: \u201cGeneral wear and tear should\nbe expected but this much damage\nin a few days makes you wonder why\nwe bother, covering the cost of this\ndamage is equivalent to 10% on the\nprice of drinks.\u201dAcknowledging that\nthe damage is caused by a minority of\n\u2018drunk, stupid people\u2019, Ashley\u2019s message to students is: \u201cIf you see someone you know damaging Union prop-erty, tell them to pack it in!\u201d\nAn article in felix dating 20th November revealing\ncriminal damage to the Union Building\nGovernment cuts university\nfunding by \u00a3398 million\nLord Mandelson wonders where the steering wheel is in his car\nreason that the students should take\nthe hit for it.\u201d\nDespite the department considering\nthe use of past questions and answers\nas against course regulations, some\npeople have suggested this logic is\nflawed. Students were encouraged to\nconsult their peers in answering the\ntwo Problem Based Learning assessments in which they could freely revisit\nthe online test within a time period of\none week. \u2018Peers\u2019 would have included\nstudents repeating their second year,\nand hence the recycled assessment\nquestions would have allowed these\nstudents, doing the exact same test\ntwice, to be unfairly at a distinct advantage to their first-time counterparts.\nEven more embarrassment has been\npiled onto the department after one\nstudent revealed they had been initially\ncongratulated by staff on their excellent\ngrades; the AMB coursework is known\nto be notoriously difficult amongst 2nd\nand 3rd years. The department is said\nto have been notified of the use of past\nassessments by students unhappy that\ntheir fellow biologists had used past\nyears\u2019 scripts, and subsequently taken\nthe action that has angered many.\nWhether or not the students were\nright to use past assessments to complete an open assessment, it seems the\nBiology department has been naive to\nthink their students would not track\ndown previous assessments from elder\nyears, to revise from or otherwise.\nThe SAF wasn\u2019t a happy place for biologists over the Christmas period\n\n"

Immediately, I see Lavery has long\nlost his \u2018nice guy\u2019 off-field manner and\nis leading the Ladies\u2019 team with characteristic militancy. It is a trait which\nrefuses to cease as I follow the team\u2019s\nprogress for the next month.\nIn a brief moment when he takes his\neyes off a flowing practice match, he\nspots the men\u2019s team arriving and is\nquick to remedy idle legs. He \u2018suggests\u2019\na warm up leg around Hyde Park\u2019s Serpentine Lake and IC GAC\u2019s Chairman\nEdward O\u2019Hare gladly agrees to lead\nthe troops. There\u2019s no waiting around\nand as soon as we have put our bags\ndown, we commence on a demanding\nthree kilometre exercise.\nOn completion of the warm-up that\ncould have constituted my monthly\nwork-out, it is explained that the team\nneeds to reach \u2018championship fitness\u2019,\nand that these warm-ups should become less gruelling, and in time will\neventually become standard practice.\nBy the time we jog back to the training pitch, the Ladies\u2019 team are packing\nup and seem to be in good spirits about\ntheir upcoming match against vastly\nsuperior opponents in Trinity College.\nAs Edward O\u2019Hare tries to explain\nthe game of Gaelic football to me in\nthree minutes, I experience Lavery\u2019s\ndetermination and drive for the game\nfirst hand. He wants me to get stuck\nstraight in at the deep end but O\u2019Hare\nthinks otherwise. Lavery isn\u2019t having\nany of it, but the situation is resolved\nwhen he notices the boys waiting behind him for further instruction.\n*\nA WOMAN\u2019S TOUCH\nLegs and heads rested, the team were\nin an upbeat mood upon their arrival\nin Dublin. There is a sense of trepidation as I talk to some of the girls, but\nthey\u2019re sure they can give a good account of themselves on the pitch the\nnext day.\nFor the Irish members of the team,\na sense of familiarity harboured, and\nthere was a poignant feel in the Dublin\nair as these players came home to test\nthemselves against some of Ireland\u2019s\nbest college-level football players with\nan essentially English team.\nThe Ladies\u2019 team played first but\nthere wasn\u2019t much time for pleasantries before the match. Being ushered\ninto their dressing room on their arrival to the ground, their march onto\nthe pitch saw them meet their imposing opponents for the very first time.\nTrinity casually warmed up and it was\nimmediately obvious that their evident\nphysical strength would make Imperial\u2019s day one of hard graft.\nImperial\u2019s line up featured plenty of\npace throughout the side. What they\nlacked in experience and technical\nability, Imperial\u2019s rapid progression up\nand down the field caused problems\nfor Trinity all afternoon.\nImperial\u2019s pace nearly paid off shortly\nafter kick-off when left half-back Jackie\nFok started the first of many counterattacks for the team, which nearly\nresulted in a shock lead. However,\nTrinity\u2019s ex- perience counted\nfor more this time and stifled\nthe attack on the goal line.\nThe game quickly settled down\nafter this flurry of activity, and soon\nenough Trinity\u2019s solid team struck\nthree points and netted a goal in quick\nsuccession. As Ladies coach Phil Jakeman blew gaskets on the touchline,\nImperial responded with a goal of their\nown. After a few minutes of solid defensive play led by centre-back and\ncaptain Katie Cullen, Imperial slowly\npushed the equilibrium away from\ntheir own half, and eventually found\nthemselves in the right half once again.\nThough messy in front of goal, some\npoor Trinity defending allowed a goal-mouth scramble to end in the back of\nthe net, with Chloe Mckeon claiming\nthe final touch and making it 1-03 1-00\nto Trinity early on in the half.\nTrinity attempted to continue in an\nexpected onslaught of points, but were\nregularly answered by their opponent\nminnows.\nDespite going in at half time behind,\nImperial took the positives out of\ntheir brave first half performance and\npushed on in the second. A frustrated\nFiona O\u2019Connell voiced her concerns\nin no uncertain terms about the lack of\ndefensive organisation, leaving her job\nas goalkeeper an impossible task for\nlong periods of the first half.\nThough not quite solid enough to\ncounter Trinity\u2019s strength in the centre of the park, the midfield pairing\nof Chloe McKeon and Carla Mulas\nproved fruitful in front of the posts.\nMan-of-the-match McKeon saw a second green flag raised for her when she\nfound herself one-on-one with Trinity\u2019s goalkeeper, who did well to get a\nleg to a powerful strike. McKeon, how-ever, kept her composure and followed\nthe looping deflection under the bar\nand into the back of the net. Mulas did\nImperial an important service by striking three points, including one from\na well-taken free kick, in a fashion\nthat made it look like she\u2019d be\nplaying Gaelic football for\nyears.\nHalf-forwards, Sophie McLaclan and\nEileen Brandley,\ntook on the unglam-orous yet extremely effective role of mopping\nup IC\u2019s desperate clearances from defence, and\nA BEGINNER\u2019S GUIDE\n\u201cFok\u2019s particularly\nimpressive speed\ndid her team many\nfavours, allowing\nsporadic penetration\nof a well-ordered\nTrinity team.\u201d\nClockwise from lower left: Carla Mulas strikes a point in\nCoach Phil Jakeman bark orders from the sidelines, th\nTrinity, Chloe McKeon slots home her second goal,\n\u2022 A centuries old Irish sport, somewhat li\nfar the most popular game in Ireland th\nmainstream in Britain, the USA and Eur\n\u2022 Played 15-a-side on a large rectangular f\nposts, only with a football-like net on th\n\u2022 The object is to score either a point (be\ngoal (putting it in the net) which is equ\n2-07 to 1-04 (goals-points) means the f\n\u2022 Progress is made by passing the ball by\nvery difficult skill to master and involve\nrunning at full speed.\n\u2022 You\u2019re not allowed to throw the ball or\nmust be kicked up into your hands from\nskill to learn.\n\u2022 Tackling is quite physical and although\nsee plenty of hard hitting.

You\nbring her your favourite childhood photo.\nIt\u2019s of you and your\nfather playing in the\ngarden, before everything changed. You show it to\nher but she\u2019s too busy on the phone and just waves\nyou away and mouths \u201cCome back tomorrow\u201d\n.\nYou feel like shouting \u201cWhy would I ever come\nback to you!\u201d But you don\u2019t. You never do.\nScorpio\nThis week, as you walk\ninto university, a walk\nof over an hour because\nyou can\u2019t afford the bus\nor tube, it begins to\nsnow. It gets colder and\ncolder and unfortunately you left your jacket at\nhome. You succumb to the elements and die. Your\nbody is concealed in the snow. Nobody notices\nthat you\u2019re even gone until you don\u2019t turn up for\nexams in June.\nLibra\nThis week, while your\nsitting alone in the\nlibrary cafe, a nice girl\nsits down and offers\nyou a crisp. You smile\nat her suspiciously and\nreach in to take one. But your arm accidentally\nknocks her coffee all over the floor. You apologize\nfrantically and run to buy her a new one. But\nwhen you return, she\u2019s already left. The coffee\u2019s\nbeginning to burn your fingers. It feels good.\nTaurus\nThis week you feel\nthe ground shaking.\nIt\u2019s an earthquake!\nThe ceiling\u2019s about to\nfall and you\u2019re fucked\nbut you live in Haiti\nso Death is probably a relief from the shitness\nof everyday life. Miraculously you survive but\nsome douchebag BBC photographer takes a\nphoto of you as you emerge and now you\u2019re\nwhored out to every major news outlet.\nCapricorn\nThis week, one of\nthe horoscopes\nexactly matches your\nexperiences. You begin\nto hope that maybe the\nwriter of the horoscopes\nis a kindred spirit, rejected by society. But no, I just\nmade these up, but you live it, every single day of\nyour dull and meaningless existence. This is life,\nit doesn\u2019t get any better and eventually you die.\nThat\u2019s all. Sorry. Pint?\nAquarius\nThis week, you\u2019re\nlying in bed and\nstaring at the ceiling.\nYour room is pretty\nbare, there\u2019s nothing\nto look at which\nis why you stare at the ceiling. The mattress\nis hard and uncomfortable and there\u2019s only\nthree hours before the new day begins again.\nAnother night without sleep and tomorrow,\nanother day without joy.\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006\n\u0007 \b\nSagittarius\nThis week, as you write\nyour cries for attention\nin the horoscopes,\nthe rest of the Editors\nlaugh and joke about\nhow edgy they are this\nweek. They don\u2019t really care whether you live or\ndie. If you didn\u2019t come down here to do your page\neach week, they wouldn\u2019t care. They wouldn\u2019t text\nor call you. They\u2019d just advertise for a new Editor.\nThey\u2019d probably do a better job than you.\n\n"

Last year\nImperial had three podium finishes,\nwith Hannah Bryars taking the gold in\nwomen\u2019s foil. Could we do better this\ntime?\nThe sun had hardly risen on Friday\nmorning as the fencers crammed into\na union minibus and made their way\nnorth to Nottingham Uni for the first\ntwo events : Men\u2019s epee and Women\u2019s\nsabre. Stumbling off the bus and into\nthe sports hall, the competitors still\nmanaged to shine, with Marcello Colombino building on his silver medal\nfrom last year by emerging as top seed\nafter poules. Fellow 1st-team epeeist\nEd Gilhead also got off to a promising\nstart, and hopes were high going into\nthe knockout rounds. However, after\na relatively easy progress through the\nearly stages, they both faltered in the\nlast 16 and lost their matches by the\nnarrowest of margins, 15-14. Ultimately, Colombino finished 9th and Gilhead\n16th, with Chris Gilliam also finishing\n39th out of 118 participants (not bad\nfor a foilist!). At the same time, Clare\nHarding grabbed the 17th spot in the\nWomen\u2019s Sabre. No podium finishes,\nthen, but a good effort by Imperial on\nthe first day.\nSaturday dawned, and the trusty\nminibus ferried the bleary-eyed\nbunch to the hall for the second day\nof competing. It was the men\u2019s foil and\nwomen\u2019s epee this time, with ICFC\nproviding 6 foilists and 2 epeeists. Gilliam breezed through his poule and\ntopped the seedings, displaying some\nvery good fencing in the process. The\nother foilists also posted fine perform-ances, with both Rob Shaw and Colin\nAuclair winning all their matches and\nno-one losing more than two. Unfortunately this success in the poules did not\ntranslate very well to the direct eliminations as Ed Collier, Indy Leclercq\nand Alex Morris all got knocked out in\nthe round of 64; Auclair in the 32 and\nShaw and Gilliam in the 16. A disapMen\u2019s first team miss out on top spot at Oxford\nA\nweek after the individual\nchampionships in Nottingham, the men\u2019s first\nteam drove up to Oxford\nfor their initial round of\nPremiership matches. This was the\nfirst major test of the season, facing\nup to the Oxford, Cambridge UCL and\nBristol teams.\nThe day began against a somewhat\nragged (not to mention late) UCL\nteam. Despite a slow start, the IC\nfencers made short work of their fellow Londoners, winning by relatively\nlarge margins in all three weapons.\nImperial\u2019s first victory in the Premiership was clinched on a final score of\n135-78. The next match up was againt\nBristol, who on paper were going to\nbe a tougher test. Good fencing by the\nfoilists set the stage for the sabreurs,\ntrailing by a single point; the epeeists\nwrapped up the match nicely, dominating their bout all the way through.\nIn high spirits after their two successive wins, the fencers then took on\nOxford. A nail-biting sabre match saw\nImperial score the final hit to win 45-44; the foil match was even tighter and\nlost by a single point.\nWith the score evenly tied, the\nepeeists had to wait for the following\nmorning to finish the match, and did\nso emphatically, sealing victory with a\nnine-point advantage, 133-124.\nAll that remained was Cambridge,\nhowever with Ratneswaran absent the\nsabre team suffered a heavy loss to the\nexperienced Cambridge side, and victories in the foil and epee could not\noverturn the deficit : the IC fencers\nlost by seven points in the end, 122-115. Imperial came away from Oxford\nwith a well-deserved second place and\nconfident that they could beat anyone.\nNext up : the return leg of the tourna-ment, at Ethos on the 30-31st of January. With the top spot firmly in sight.\nIndy Leclercq Fencing\n\n"

We\narrived at the bunkhouse at 10:30, after\na 13 hour drive. However, in the greatest traditions of Imperial, we decided\nto start drinking. We then went to bed\nslightly bemused, but sort of ready to\nbrave whatever Scotland threw at us.\nAfter little sleep and no hangover\non behalf of Nathaniel (the man is a\nmachine) we started our first day. We\ngot up at 7 and started walking at 8, to\nmaximise the 7 or so hours of daylight.\nAfter a short drive in the minibus, we\nstarted on the first hike of the trip, a\nnice horseshoe around a ridge.\nWe started on a nice gentle path,\nthen using the \u2018right to roam\u2019 land to\nits full awesomeness, cut our way up\na steep slope in the snow using the ice\naxes and poles to their full extent.\nAfter this effort we felt a break was in\norder, and stopped at the top of the hill\nadmiring the awesome views of Ben\nNevis in the snow. We had a snow ball\nfight at the top of the hill, and wrestled in the snow, (no gayness involved\nhonest). Then we continued along the\nridge in snow varying between several\ninches and 2 feet.\nWhilst waiting for everyone to catch\nup, Ande, learning to map read (\u2018I\u2019m\nsure there should be a forest around\nhere\u2019) decided that putting a plastic\nmap case on an icy slope was a good\nidea. It slid all the way down the hill\nwe had just climbed, and he had to run\ndown to retrieve it while everyone fell\naround laughing.\nContinuing on, we climbed the pinnacle and progressed to our first Munro (special Scottish mountain above\n3000 feet) Stob Ban. On the way down\nfrom Stob Ban we had our first survival\nbagging of the trip. For those uninitiated in the ways of the Fellwanderer, this\ninvolves taking a thick plastic orange\nsack, that you can sleep in if you get\nstuck in the mountains, and using it as\na sledge. Unfortunately the snow was\ntoo powdery and we didn\u2019t get very\nmuch speed on the slopes. Progressing around the horseshoe we climbed\nanother Munro, Mullach Coirean, then\ndescending into a forest. The sun was\nsetting and with a howl from the north,\nthe first monster of our trip emerged, a\nPolish person with a new head torch.\nRafal took large amounts of enjoyment\nfrom blinding anyone at the wrong\nplace at the wrong time, (working on\nthe principle that When Mister Head\nTorch is not on, Then Mister Head\nTorch is not your friend).\nGetting back to the bunkhouse, we\nenjoyed the first of many Morrisonsbased meals with their yellow good-ness. Luckily we had the excellent chef,\nHeather, in charge and so the Spag bol\nworked out very well. Our pet vegetarian and president Alex even said\nto everyone\u2019s surprise that the veggie\nmince (that you have to boil rather\nthan fry!) was nice.\nAfter our rather epic first day we decided to do something that in Alex\u2019s\nwords was low level, so we started very\nlow and ended up at the summit of the\nseventh highest mountain in the UK.\nAfter a short minibus ride, we set off\nwalking, and ignoring the danger sign\non the side of the path we proceeded\nalong an icy track through a forest.\nEmerging from the forest, we walked\nthrough a valley admiring the snow\ncovered hills on either side of us. We\nclimbed up to the foot hills of Aonach\nBeag with cries of \u2018They\u2019re taking the\nhobbits to Isengard\u2019, traversing around\na smaller hill to get to the saddle point\nof Aonach Beag. However, we didn\u2019t\nrealise that the hill was so slippery. So\neven with ice axes, several people required help from the cramponed Nathaniel to get them across. We stopped\nfor lunch at the saddle only to realise\nthat the smaller hill we were going\naround had been protecting us from\nthe bitter wind which started flicking\nup powder snow into our faces. Then\nafter the shortest lunch in the history\nof man, we set off on the \u2018final ascent\u2019\nto Aonach Beag. We continued to the\ntop and were rewarded with awesome\nviews of the winter wonderland that\nsurrounded us. Continuing down, we\nreached the icy sections in the dark,\nconvincing ourselves that moonlight\nwas better than torches.\nWith ice on the roads there were a\nfew worried looks from the Fellwanderers as the bus skidded around cor-ners. We finished the day with another\nexcellent meal of bangers and mash,\nfollowed by more of Heather\u2019s cake\n(cutting it with several impressive rebounds from a spear).\nThe fourth day was our rest day,\nwith an optional walk to see the north\nface of Ben Nevis from Coire Leis. As\na testament to the Fellwanderers or\npossibly because of the pictures of the\nface on the walls of the kitchen, all but\n4 did this epic walk. We started from\nthe hut and walked up to the saddle of\nBen Nevis. Once we hit the saddle we\nwere again hit by strong winds throwing powder snow in our faces, so much\nso that we had to face the other way\nwhen the wind gusted. We then traversed around to get into the valley of\nthe north face. Once we got there the\nstrong winds intensified, funnelling\nthrough the valley and making walking\nmore difficult.\nContinuing along the valley we noticed a flare going up on the north face\nand a rescue helicopter flying over to it.\nThinking there must be a training exercise on the mountain we continued on\nlosing the path in the deep snow. Alex\nstarted making a new path through the\nsnow for us all to follow; suddenly, we\nall heard a loud crack as the ice under\nAlex\u2019s boots broke, leaving him in a\nfoot of icy water. Then Chris, thinking\nhe had found a better path through,\nalso sunk into the water. Apparently\neven in frozen Scotland we cannot get\naway from the Bogwanderers.\nWhen we finally reached the hut and\ngot changed, Ande took stock of the\nkitchen. Despite getting there a lot earlier than everyone else he still wasn\u2019t\nfinished making shopping lists. Alex,\namid protests from Heather and Ande,\nclaimed he knew exactly what to buy.\nThis seemed to amount to needing \u2018lots of hand waving\u2019 amounts of\npotatoes, pasta and other food. So\nwith pained looks from the physicists\nand mathematicians we set off to Fort\nWilliam for our afternoon off. We\nhad 3 hours to relax there. However\nthere really was nothing to do. We all\neventually ended up in the Morrison\u2019s\ncaf\u00e9, while Alex, Ande and Heather\nshopped, finding that Alex\u2019s hand waving actually meant he had no idea.\nAlex, frustrated with stupidly specific\ninstructions from Ande such as \u2018We\nneed 1.125kg of rice\u2019 wandered off on\nhis own to find the Haggis. Nathaniel\nbought two more bottles of Whisky.\nWe also had to say goodbye to\nYvonne that day as she was going to\nmeet some of her friends for New\nYear\u2019s. She was replaced by a new Fellwanderer convert Beccy. Getting back\nwe discovered to our delight that the\nveggie meal planned had been cancelled and replaced by Fajitas. After\nthe meal we chatted to some of the\nother people staying in the bunk-house, to discover that the helicopters\nwe had seen earlier had been called to\ntry to rescue a party of 3 climbers on\nthe north face. Only one made it back\nalive and it was a sobering to think how\nquickly the mountains can turn against\npeople who were less than a \u00bd a kilometre from us.\nWaking up the next day, we followed the same route for the first half\nmile looking at the steep hill we had\nclimbed earlier; thinking about how\nmuch worse it looked now the snow\nhad been blown off it.\nUpon reaching the top of the valley,\nwe had the most epic survival bagging\nsession of the trip, which then degenerated into a snow wrestling match.\nThis, I must point out, despite being\ndescribed as \u2018erotic snow play\u2019 by certain members of the party, was completely heterosexual.\nWe then followed the West Highland Way along for several miles, going through a forest in the dark ending\nup on a hill side overlooking the lights\nof the bustling metropolis that is Fort\nWilliam.\nStarting our New Year\u2019s Eve party,\nChris, Alex and Nathaniel became\nimprovised Scotsmen by constructing\nkilts out of survival bags and towels\nand running around shouting FREEDOM! We then started a game of \u2018Fellwanderers\u2019 ring of fire. This turned\ninto less of a drinking session and more\ninto a cross-dressing party, ending up\nwith Chris wearing a tight top and\npants, and Ande in a low cut top and\nleopard skin leggings!\nLuckily New Year came and everyone got distracted by the countdown\nand afterwards didn\u2019t seem to remember anything. With the new year seen\nin we all headed back to the bunk-house, with the more extreme people\nstaying up to continue ring of fire. We\nwere joined by an awesome Scottish\nguy, who traded our President Alex\u2019s\njeans for a kilt, and I can confirm for\nall of our female readers that he did go\nfull Scottish, swinging his underwear\naround his head before throwing it\naway Full Monty style. The game continued for a while with large amounts\nof good whisky mixed with \u2018olde English\u2019 cider being consumed by all until\nwe all stumbled off to bed.\nThe next day, we split into 3 groups;\none group did a river walk, ending up\nin a pub where we waited the previous day, enjoying hot chocolate. Ande\nand Heather did a short walk into Fort\nWilliam, and our beloved president\nstayed in bed all day recovering from\nhis pains. Towards the end of the day\nwe managed to convince him that\nthere was more to the world than his\nduvet, and he joined us for dinner and\nmore drinks. Due to our president\u2019s\nillness (vegetarianism not being hung-over), we finished the day with our\nsole veggie meal Cous Cous, to Chris\u2019\ndispleasure.\nOn the last hiking day of the trip we\nfinally managed to make it up Ben Nevis. We flew up the first few sections\nthat we had walked before to the sad-dle. As we were climbing the next few\nsections the clouds started moving in\naround us, giving us brief glimpses of\nthe amazing panorama around us. We\nreached the top in good time, and had\nfirst lunch there. Nathaniel brought up\nbeer to the top and had the highest can\nof beer in the UK. We reached the saddle early and decided to do a bit more\nwalking. We climbed Meall an t-Suide\nwhich is on the Ben Nevis ridge, our\nlast walk of the trip.\nI would just like to thank all of the\npeople that made this trip amazing:\nAlex who did an excellent job organising this trip, Heather who did an fantastic job with the food, the minibus\ndrivers, and quite frankly everyone for\nputting up with me. I regret that I cannot mention everyone by name in arti-cle. We all really enjoyed this trip and\nI hope you enjoyed reading about it. I\nhope to see you on a Fellwanderers trip\nin the future!\nThere\u2019s nothing like an ice-axe fight to keep you warm\n\n"

The world\u2019s biggest, brightest and best\nwere on hand to show attendees their wares, generate buzz and all\nthe while hoping that they\u2019re the next big thing. For those of you not\nfamiliar with the buzz, hype and flat out lunacy of CES, it\u2019s THE event in the tech\ncalendar and takes place every January, kicking off the gadget year with a bang in\nLas Vegas, the city of sin, sun and cold hard cash. Enough of the blurb, you\u2019ve got\nthe idea, so what has 2010 got in store for us?\nTab\nCES might have been the year of 3D TV and\nmanufacturers from making an appearance. Of c\nmythical iTablet the \u2018Slate\u2019 everything with a tab\nHP is no exception letting Microsoft kick off it\u2019s\nSlate. Steve Ballmer was wielding the prototype\nreader app. The tablet is multi-touch capable a\ntaking great delight playing Frogger in front of th\nlater this year.\nLenovo made more of an impact with their I\nthis seemingly ordinary laptop has a pretty slick\nmulti-touch display. The laptop half of the com\nwith a 128GB SSD holding Windows 7 Home Pr\nabout this little beauty is that the slate itself is po\na touch-screen version of the Skylight smartboo\nand you\u2019re away.\nT-Mobile also showed off something fancy\nAndroid tablet. Powered by Nvidia\u2019s Tegra 250\nof Android 2.0, the Vega is tailored towards th\nyou\u2019ve got an easy to use internet tablet with s\nT-Mobile SIM pre-installed. The Vega also pack\nsupport built-in, although the Vega\u2019s 15\u201d screen\nyet to be fleshed out but expect some sort of sub\nT-Mobile 15-inch ICD Vega Tablet, Android fam\n3D TV\nOnward the march of 3D! Not content only to smash its way back into the big\nscreen, 3D is infiltrating our homes and poking its finger right into your face.\nSony was there with its pretty incredible 24.5\u201d OLED 3D Bravia boasting incredible blacks and colour vibrancy, even if the 3Dness reduces the available colour\ngamut.\nESPN announced it would be showing World Cup games in 3D for all to behold.\nIt won\u2019t just be football though with the Summer X games, NBA and of course\nNFL hitting America in the 3rd dimension. DirecTV also showed off its 3D wares\nat CES which the company is set to roll out in June this year. In this country\nBSkyB has already made its intentions clear about 3D with Sky1\u2019s Gladiators\nalready being recorded in stereoscope. If you\u2019re a Sky subscriber and you happen\nto be packing a 3D HDTV, then look out for the roll out sometime this year. If you\nhaven\u2019t got a nice big 3D HDTV just yet, you might want to consider an LG, who\nwere on the scene at CES with two 3D LCDs, 55\u201d and 47\u201d models, which will be\navailable around April this year.\nOf course most of this 3D technology still requires the use of polarized glasses\nlike those you have to wield whilst in the cinema for Avatar and alike. Intel\nhowever showed of its glasses-free 3D tech. Using a coating applied to the screen\nof the HDTV and specially recorded 3D video it\u2019s possible to create depth without\nresorting to wearing specs. The only problem with it is that there are only about\neight specific places one can stand to experience the effect and the resolution\nthe demo was running was sub 720p. I don\u2019t know about you, but for me no-glasses 3D trumps the spectacle requiring variety, so I hope content producers\nand providers take note.\nNot to be muscled out, Panasonic was also on show at CES with some serious\npieces of kit. How about the world\u2019s first integrated Full HD 3D camcorder. OK,\nit\u2019s not your average pocket shooter, but the \u2018Professional\u2019 camcorder packs\neverything you need to record 3D in one package. Up for order in April and\ncarrying a price tag of $21,000, you better have a pretty good reason for wanting\nto record your kid brother running into a window in 3D.\nNow available\nin stereoscope\nW\nell there goes Christmas! Hope you all had a\ncracking break and got\nsome awesome gadg-ets. But if you\u2019re like me and money\nis all you\u2019ve got to show from the holiday season, apart from a larger gut of\ncourse, then this week you might find a\nfew things to prise that cold hard cash\nout of your hands.\nThe start of the technology year always kicks off with what\u2019s arguably the\nbiggest and most important exhibition\nin the consumer electronics calendar.\nCES, which is only open to industry\ntypes, journalists and the movers and\nshakers of the world, holds a treasure\ntrove of innovation, bizarre technology\nand a load of gadget-lust inducing gear.\nThis year, although we\u2019re in the midst,\nor tail end depending on who you be-lieve, of a recession, the manufacturers\nstill turned up with some impressive\ntech.\nWe\u2019ve taken the time to go through\nthe total information overload that is\nCES for you, to pick out some choice\nand outstanding products that you\nmight just see on your virtual shelves\nsometime in the near future.\n3D played a massive role this year at\nCES. One could say the third dimension is definitely \u2018in\u2019. For better or for\nworse, depending on what your position is on the whole 3D being the future thing, the TV and film industry is\ntrying it\u2019s hardest to shove it into your\nmedia enriched lives. Of course 3D\nnot only means new TVs, new PVRs\nand boxes, but glasses. Yep, glasses.\nGreat, so now not only have you got\nto wear glasses all day whilst trying to\nread things, but when you get home\nand relax you\u2019re going to have to don\nanother pair of spectacles just to watch\nthe damn TV.\nOK, so you can probably tell by now\nthat I\u2019m not such a huge fan of 3D.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, a 3D hologram\nprojected in front of me would be totally awesome, but 3D from TV and\nfilm in my opinion rarely adds to the\nexperience. A recent trip to the cinema\nto watch Avatar, cemented my view. Although 3D cinema might add to some\nthings, especially walking through the\ngiganto-smurf forest, for the most part\nI could do without it. It doesn\u2019t help\nthat the 3D glasses are cheap and hurt\nyour ears after a while, something I\nfound particularly annoying in Cameron\u2019s two hour 30 minutes plus effort.\nStill there\u2019s bound to be custom specs\navailable in the near future.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nTransparent screens will soon be making their way out of science fiction movies\nand into our lives, with a major story out of CES being Samsung\u2019s new transparent OLED displays. The technology promises to offer up to 40% transparency, a\nlarge and very obvious improvement over older transparent display technology.\nSamsung is planning to release an MP3 player and a phone that make use of this\ntechnology later this year. While the resolution of the OLED screens leaves much\nto be desired, Samsung is obviously betting on the novelty factor attracting cus-tomers, with the phone priced at \u00a3620 even while lacking a camera.\nWhile the technology unquestionably has applications in many fields, the most\nimportant being true heads-up displays in full colour, it\u2019s questionable exactly how\nuseful the technology is right now. The 40% transparency isn\u2019t enough to embed\nthem in automobiles, and being able to see through your computer monitor is\nmore a detriment than anything else. A lot more work will be required before\nSamsung can market these products as anything more than a pricey novelty for\nearly adopters.\nGreat, more distractions from work, essential student gear this.\nTransparent Displays\nGlorious colour and the 3D\u2019s optional. Sony\u2019s onto a winner here.\nThis is what $21,000 buys you in 3D camcorders. An ugly beast.\n\n"

A new year, and a new\nterm, are upon us, and 2010 promises\nto be a massive one in terms of sport.\nFor starters, the winter Olympics\nare set to kick off in Vancouver next\nmonth.\nFrom skiing to figure skating (not\nforgetting everyone\u2019s favourite sport,\ncurling), it should be a month of dizzying stuff in chilled conditions-and\nthat\u2019s just the Jamaican bobsled team.\nMy special mention goes to the Ghanaian alpine skier, Kwame NkrumahAcheampong, nicknamed \u201cthe Snow\nLeopard\u201d. He\u2019s Ghana\u2019s first ever participant at a winter Olympics, but\npicked up skiing in\u2026Milton Keynes.\nOh, and he was a safari guide before\nthat. Some people, I swear\u2026Before\nyou know it, he\u2019ll be a champion base-jumper after trying it once in Watford,\nor something.\nHe\u2019s not the only African to be in the\nsporting spotlight this year. The African Cup of Nations is going on this\nweek and next, and is generating much\ninterest in the run up to the football\nWorld Cup held in South Africa. Some\npundits think this is the year an African team could go all the way, on their\nown continent\u2026but the likes of the\nIvory Coast and Cameroon will have to\ndeal with heavyweights such as Brazil,\nEngland and favourites Spain.In any\ncase, spectacle awaits. The World Cup\nrarely disappoints.\nAnother first this year is the initial\nYouth Olympic Games, to be held in\nSingapore this summer. I suppose it\u2019s\na chance for all the young\u2019uns to strut\ntheir stuff on an international stage,\nand you never know, we might get\nto see the next Bolt-in-the-making.\nSome of the participants will definitely\nturn up in the London games in two\nyears time, so be sure to keep an eye on\nthe small city-state come August.\nCloser to home, a new term means\nit\u2019s time to run off all that turkey/\nChristmas pudding/mince pie ingested\nduring the holidays and get back down\nto business.\nThe various leagues continue, and\npretty soon all the cup matches will\nkick off, leading to the BUCS championship finals in Sheffield towards the\nend of term. Not to mention this year\u2019s\nVarsity, which will be bigger than ever.\nLooking at the felixSport league ta-ble, the men\u2019s volleyball and women\u2019s\nfencing teams are as yet unbeaten.\nLet\u2019s hope that run of form continues;\nhaving said that, I wish the best of luck\nto each and every one of our teams.\nKeep doing your best, keep having\nfun; most importantly, don\u2019t forget to\nwrite match reports and take plenty of\npictures so we can tell everyone about\nyour glorious victories (or not-so-glo-rious defeats-we want everything).\nThanks to everyone who sent something in last term. We need your words,\nand if we haven\u2019t got anything to put in\nyou\u2019ll be subjected to more of this...so\nfor everyone\u2019s sake, help us out! We\u2019re\nalso working on making felixSport that\nmuch more interesting, so look out for\nupcoming sports features and interviews with the people who make Imperial\u2019s clubs tick.\nRight, that\u2019s done, I think I might go\nfor a run now.

All this became cruelly apparent to me a month\nago when our beloved friend and\nbrother, Mohammad Bilal Riaz, died in\na barbaric act of terrorism in Pakistan\non 4th Dec 2009.\nBilal came to Imperial in 2008 for\nhis MSc in Communication and Signal\nProcessing at EEE, and after submitting his dissertation went back to Pakistan to get married to his fianc\u00e9 on\n15th Dec; little did anyone know that\nhe would breathe his last just ten days\nbefore his wedding. On 4th Dec gunmen attacked a mosque in Rawalpindi\nduring Friday prayers; Bilal was there\nwith his five-year-old nephew. He hid\nhis nephew underneath him to protect\nhim from the bullets, was shot and died\non the spot. I am recounting these\ngruesome details so that I can let people know that even in the face of death\nhe was brave and sacrificed his own life\nto save another. In that miniscule moment we lost a friend, a brother, a son;\nin short a truly loved one. No consolation is enough for his loving fianc\u00e9,\nbereaved parents, siblings and friends.\nThey face an irreparable loss and their\nlives will never be the same again.\nLife is cruel\u2026yet so beautiful - his\nown words so aptly describe his short\nbut fulfilling life. To an observer it\nwould seem that Bilal had the best of\neverything; he excelled in every field\nof life be it education, extracurricu-lar, family, friends or love and died a\nmartyr\u2019s death which we will always\nremember. But there were dreams and\naspirations to fulfill, promises to be\nkept and moments to cherish and all\nthese died with him and so did a part\nof us.\nI am not interested in the many conspiracy theories as to why Pakistan \u2013\nan extremely strategic piece of land -Bilal Riaz was a victim of December\u2019s barbaric terrorism in Pakistan. Friend Sana Ahmed\npays tribute to a courageous man who died saving the life of his five-year old nephew\nLife is cruel, yet so beautiful...\nis on the brink of civil war. All I care\nabout is that my fellow countrymen are\ndying for no reason at all, our lands are\nstained red with the blood of innocents\nand I have had enough. Above is an\nexample of just one heart-wrenching\nstory, you will find one in every corner of my country. World leaders and\npoliticians condemn these attacks and\nurge Pakistan to \u2018do more\u2019 but only we\nmourn; words are but lame excuses to\nmask hidden agendas.

With\ntwo days of sailing and a sheep themed\nsocial the event hosted by Cardiff University was set to be a good one.\nDay one saw a frankly abysmal performance from the 3 boat Imperial\nteam in the mini-league. In their first\nrace, against Portsmouth Firsts, Imperial got 4th 5th and 6th, giving Portsmouth 1st 2nd and 3rd. Imperial\u2019s\nsecond race, against Exeter Ladies,\nwasn\u2019t much better. Imperial had a\nfighting chance until the second mark\nwhen Gavin MacAulay got a penalty\nturn from trying a risky overtake then\ncrashing into an Exeter boat. Chris\nO\u2019Donnell was forced the wrong side\nof the mark, trying to push his way into\na gap that was too small and which he\nhad no right to be in, leaving Fiona\nWall to battle all three Exeter boats by\nherself. This ended up with Imperial\ngetting another 4th 5th 6th.\nThe second lot of the days racing was\nmarginally better, but still unsuccess-ful, with Imperial getting a 3rd 4th 6th\nagainst Swansea in a race which was\nclosely fought to the end. The last race\nof the day was against the hosts- Cardiff. The Imperial team fought hard,\nbut a mark trap from Cardiff at the\nlast mark put the hosts in 1st 2nd 3rd\n\u2013 a wining position and so stealing the\nrace from Imperial. In Imperial\u2019s defence three of the teams they raced got\nthrough to the semi-finals, and Portsmouth won the league.\nDay two brought much more wind\nand with it, a fresh chance for Imperial with a King Of The Hill competi-tion- a royal rumble style competition\nwhere the worst placing teams from\nthe league start off at the bottom and\nfight their way to the top. Lose one race\nand you\u2019re out.\nIn a major (non-Imperial related) incident on the first day, one of the boats\nwas damaged and put out of use. In the\ninterest of fairness it was decided that\nracing would just be 2 v. 2.\nMiraculously, Imperial didn\u2019t start\noff at the very bottom of the Hill, that\nhonour went to UWE and Bristol\nFourths. Bristol walked over their opponents getting 1st and 2nd, knocking\nUWE out of the competition. Imperial\nthen raced Bristol and in turn, Bristol\nwere crushed, giving Imperial 1st 2nd\nand putting them ahead of two teams-Bristol and UWE. Imperial continued\nin this manner, beating anyone who\ncame their way with a 1st 2nd.\nImperial\u2019s luck started to turn when\nthey came against Brunel. Chris\nO\u2019Donnell got off to a very poor start\n-only just crossing the line when the\nother boats were reaching the first\nmark, and with Gavin MacAulay in\n2nd things were looking bleak. On\nthe downwind leg Gavin sped into first\nand put himself in a perfect position to\nmark-trap the two Brunel boats. Gavin\ncut across the path of the Brunel boats,\nshouting wildly, forcing them to keep\nout of his path. In the confusion the\ntwo Brunel boats crashed, taking each\nother out of the race allowing Chris to\nsail past, giving Imperial another 1st\n2nd. Remarkably, after this race Chris\nrealised he\u2019d been racing all day in a\nboat with two holes in it, requiring a\nchange over before the next race...\nImperial\u2019s final race of the day was\nagainst Portsmouth Seconds. In a\nclosely fought race Portsmouth dominated on the final leg and won with a\n1st 2nd, knocking Imperial out of the\ncompetition and going on to win the\nwhole King Of The Hill. Overall, Imperial got to the middle of the Hill.\nChris O\u2019Donnell Sailing\nWe still need your opinions.

After\ntwo fruitless days, the last two events\nbrought some promising results in the\npoules, and before too long, there were\nthree foilists in the last eight and two\nsabreurs in the semis!\nAlice Mitchell got knocked out in a\nclose quarter-final match; Outi Supponen and the ever-dependable Hannah\nBryars made it to the semis, meaning\nImperial were guaranteed at least four\nmedals\u2026Unfortunately, kit problems\nled to Supponen\u2019s defeat in her semifinal : the all-Imperial final was not to\nbe.

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010\nFEATURE\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGAELIC FOOTBALL IS A QUICKLY BUDDING GAME ON IMPERIAL\u2019S SPORTS SCENE; IC GAELIC\nATHLETIC CLUB BOASTS FULL ROSTERS FOR BOTH MENS\u2019 AND LADIES\u2019 TEAMS THIS YEAR.\nDAN WAN FOLLOWS THEM ON THEIR TOUR OF DUBLIN AND EVEN GETS STUCK IN HIMSELF\nin turn, created several chances that\ncould have evened out the scores.\nImperial\u2019s forwards also benefitted\ngreatly from their team\u2019s speedy play\non the wings as they added to Imperial\u2019s score with points of their own.\nXenia Snetkov, Catherine Parkinson\nand Scarlett Gillespie were especially\nable to move forward and try their luck\non goal several times throughout the\n60 minutes, yielding a combined five\npoints between them.\nThe soloing pace of Sarah Jean and\nJackie Fok out wide set up several attacks which resulted in points that\nImperial desperately needed in the\nsecond half. Fok\u2019s particularly impressive speed did her team many favours,\nallowing sporadic penetration of a\nwell-ordered Trinity team. Afterwards,\neven the Trinity players conceded that\nduring moments of the game, Imperial\u2019s two quick wide players were a\nthorn in their side.\nTrinity never really ran away with\nthe game despite being in command\nfor most it. Imperial\u2019s lack of experience transferred to periods of loss\nof concentration during the second\nhalf when Trinity glady notched the\nhandful of points and few goals that\nwon them the game. However, Imperial\u2019s keeper in the second-half, Tabitha Skinner, had considerably less to\ndo than O\u2019Connell\u2019s first- half, again\nthanks to Cullen\u2019s individual unyielding performance keeping Trinity\u2019s best\nCounty-level player in check.\nFor a team that was only established\nthis year, winning against one of Ireland\u2019s most respected Ladies\u2019 university teams was always to be a very tall\norder. Despite the defeat, Imperial put\nup an energetic fight that saw them\nlargely mitigate a game led by their\nIrish counterparts.\nThe Ladies\u2019 18-strong team is largely\ninexperienced in the game of football,\nwith most of them taking up the sport\nas an entirely new experience. The next\nfew months would concentrate on developing their game in time for February\u2019s national championships held in\nManchester; no doubt that the match\nin Dublin has taught them more than a\nterm\u2019s worth of training sessions could\nhave.\n*\nBOYS IN BLUE\nAs for the men\u2019s match, it was a\nmuch more even affair and resulted\nin a closely fought game either side\ncould\u2019ve won. The game started with\nan intense period of pressure from\nTrinity, with the Imperial defence and\nkeeper being tested, but equal to almost every challenge. Jamie Sanders\nand Padhraic Comerford acquitted\nthemselves well in this period and were\nresponsible for many clearances down\nthe left and right wings respectively.\nNevertheless Trinity managed to nab\nthemselves a goal and three points to\nthe good in this prolonged period of\npossession.\nThe boys in blue were in no mood\nto lie down though with club talisman\nDanny Wilson providing the opener for\nImperial after 20 minutes. Drawing on\nhis soccer skills, Wilson half volleyed a\nloose ball straight into the back of the\nnet, leaving the keeper no chance. The\nreferee wasn\u2019t as impressed however\nand overruled the legitimate score for\nan alleged foul moments before. The\nimpetus was with Imperial now and\nthe boys won two frees which Ruairi\nO\u2019Neill ably converted from some dis-tance. Halftime score 1-03 to 0-02 to\nTrinity.\nThe second half began with Imperial\nretaining much more of the posses-sion, despite the hangover from last\nnight really beginning to take it\u2019s toll.\nTheir profligacy in the next 15 minutes\nwould come back to haunt them as\nall but one of several scoring chances\ndrifted agonisingly wide. The defence\nheld strong though and worked hard\nto create chances for the forwards, but\nwere cruelly caught out when a speculative looping effort from the Trinity\nhalf forward caught the underside of\nthe bar and dropped in giving them the\nascendancy that would be difficult to\ncatch in the remaining time. Imperial\nupped their game though and showed\na will to win, knocking over another\nfree and a fine score from play by Rob\nFitzpatrick. Trinity responded again\nand the frenetic display of counter attacking football from both teams was\ncheering up the cold supporters on\nthe sidelines. In the final minutes Imperial were rewarded with a goal of\ntheir own as their half-forward thundered a shot on goal which the keeper\nsomehow managed to initially block,\nbut could not prevent a calmly-taken\nrebound reaching the back of the net.\nThe final score read 2-07 to 1-04 to\nTrinity, although it was remarked by\nthe hosts that the score line did flatter them somewhat. Imperial\u2019s display\nof character to fight back despite going down early in the match certainly\nbodes well for their upcoming BUSA\nChampionships.\nAs I finish off this tour report, my inbox lights up and there is a new email\nfrom Andrew Lavery sent to all the\nplayers at IC GAC. He signs off in a\nmanner that gives no indication that he\nplans to let up on his vision of making\nIC GAC one of Imperial\u2019s most nationally successful teams.\n\u201cSeriously lads, this is it. Last term\nwas for messing about in the \u2018League\u2019\nbut this term is what playing Gaelic\nFootball at IC is all about. 100% commitment and a Championship victory\nfor the taking.

Daft Punk\n18 felix FRIDAY 15 JANUARY 2010\nA\nquick confession before\nI continue: I spent all of\nChristmas listening to\nEmpire of the Sun and\nPassion Pit (and a little\nBing Crosby of course.) Which brings\nme nicely onto the subject of this col-umn, music snobbery.\nEmpire of the Sun and Passion Pit\nare, here comes that dreaded word,\nmainstream. They\u2019re so mainstream\nthat the BBC recommended them to\n\u201cthe people\u201d in their \u201cSound of 2009\u201d\nlist (although apparently Passion Pit\nwere less successful, ultimately making\nthem more credible; I call it the Bombay Bicycle Club effect).\nYou\u2019ll all have noticed the fight between people who enjoy mainstream\nmusic and people who are repelled by\nit this Christmas. It was the big thing\nthis winter, in one corner, \u201cRAGE\nAGAINST THE MACHINE\u201d bellows\nthe announcer, and in the other corner,\n\u201cJOE MCELDERRY\u201d (say it aloud and\nyou\u2019ll realise how lame that sounds).\nI\u2019ll admit that I did buy \u201cKilling in the\nName Of\u201d but the whole exercise essentially involved telling a large chunk\nof the country, \u201cthe music that you listen to is SHIT. You don\u2019t know REAL\nmusic. THIS is music.\u201d\nBut ultimately, as one astute observer commented on felix\u2019s last.fm\ngroup (to break up our first online troll\nwar; awh) \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny how music is\nsubjective?\u201d\nIn the end, people will enjoy whatever music they happen to enjoy and\ntelling people that their music isn\u2019t as\ngood as the music you like is just point-less. I can\u2019t help but feel that the main\nconsequence of the RATM campaign\nis that Shelter got a whole lot of money\nand that every Christmas henceforth\nthere\u2019s going to be a Facebook campaign for some old and distinctly un-chrismassy song.\nHowever, being snobby about music can be fun sometimes, like when\nyou\u2019ve heard about a band way before\nanyone else. In light of this revelation,\nhere are the bands that I knew about\nbefore anyone else (kind of):\nThe xx\nMumford & Sons\nFlorence & The Machine\nOn the other hand, there are bands\nthat I\u2019ve listened to way after anyone\nelse. Wild Beasts are a case in point.\nThey released their album \u201cTwo\nDancers\u201d last year, we were sent the\nalbum for review and we even printed\na review of said album. And I still didn\u2019t\nlisten to it (I didn\u2019t write the review).\nBut I have listened to it now and\nfor all those people who don\u2019t already\nknow about Wild Beasts (very few I\nimagine) I give my humble recomen-dations that you look them up. Hear\npast the melodic falsetto vocals and\nyou\u2019ll notice how deliciously dark and\nweird the lyrics are.\nJust to redeem myself slightly, the\nmixtape that Four Tet gave out at his\nlast DJ set at Plastic People is now on\nthe internet, google \u201cFour Tet - Much\nLove to the Plastic People\u201d. Also Jamie\nfrom The xx has released a dubstep\nremix of Basic Space, it\u2019s called \u201cSpace\nBass\u201d They\u2019re both worth checking out.\nBut you probably already know that.\nMusic snobbery\nKadhim Shubber\nKadhim Shubber Music Editor\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors:\nMusic Editors: Alexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nAlexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com www.felixmusic.tk\nThe BBC\u2019s\nSound of 2010\nGreg Power and Hugh Crail take a look\nat a few of the artists that will likely (and\ndepressingly depending on your tastes) be\nheading the charts in the coming year\nJoy Orbison\nGold Panda\nGold Panda is a Japan-obsessed, left-field, electronic artist who stands out\nfrom the BBC\u2019s selection by being truly\noriginal.\nLacking in mainstream appeal, his\nsongs combine samples taken from\ncharity shop VHS cassettes with low-key moody backing akin to Four Tet.\nPerhaps the most important find\non this list, he may not find fame and\nchart success in 2010 (his myspace\ndoesn\u2019t display the marks of an intense\nPR push) but I bet he will be around\nmuch longer than most of the artists\nthat made it onto this list.\nDevlin\nIt was bound to happen: the BBC found\nthe Eminem of grime!

His aim was to extend scientific vision outside of taught causes\nand raise awareness of scientific topics\nin the greater public. 2006\u2019s Science\nChallenge was opened up to secondary\nschools with bursaries to Imperial College as prizes.Submissions will be accepted from the 18th of January till 7th\nMarch on sciencechallenge.org\nR.C.S.\nAfonso Campos, Science Challenge Organiser\nWHO WILL DECIDE THE WINNER?\nTHE FOUR QUESTIONS\nFORMING THE CHALLENGE\nMark Henderson\nHe graduated in modern history from Oxford University in 1996.

A good answer would not only require \u2018hard scientific fact\u2019 but also a healthy dose of imagination and an ability to envisage the implications of\nsuch a discovery. Historically, the idea of finding life outside Earth has attracted a great deal of\ninterest. Even today it remains a topical subject, with the discovery last December of planets\norbiting the stars 61 Virginis and 23 Librae - planets thought to be similar to those found in our\nsolar system and perhaps capable of harbouring life forms.\nBrigette Atkins\nScience Editor\n3\"Can renewable energy sources solve the UK's\nenergy problems?\" Athene Donald, FRS, UNESCO 2009 Woman\nScientist of the Year\nthe felix view\nAthene Donald has proposed a more general question about the environment than Andrew\nHarrison. Whilst this encourages individual interpretation and should generate many answers\nvarying widely in topic direction, it does introduce the danger of allowing answers which are\ntoo general to be interesting. A good answer to this question would most likely require the\nwriter to think outside the box to ensure their essay stands out from the crowd. As renewable\nenergy is very much an \u2018in Vogue\u2019 topic for science at present, there is no doubt this question is\ngoing to be a popular choice.\nBrigette Atkins\nScience Editor\n1 \"How will genetic advances change medicine and\nsociety by 2020?\" Mark Henderson, Science Editor, The Times\nNathan Ley\nScience Editor\nthe felix view\nThis question pretty much leaves everything up to you. There are several routes you could\ngo down with this. Critically, how do you define \u2018genetic advances\u2019? Are we talking about\nannotation of genomes? Sequencing projects? Or are we thinking more along the lines of gene\ntherapy and applications? Either way, the medicine and society aspect of this question allows\nyou to take it wherever you like. By 2020, will a human\u2019s phenotypic fate become determined by\naccess to money?\n2\"The Climate Change Act 2008 commits the UK to an\n80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050- can\ntechnology alone deliver road transports' share of this\nreduction?\"Andrew Harrison, Shell\nthe felix view\nPersonally I doubt many of you will be having a stab at this, but for those who do, feel free to\ntry and persuade us all that we humans can carry driving our gas guzzlers with no regard for the\nconsequences. What\u2019s going to save us? Hydrogen powered 4x4\u2019s? Alternatively, be a cynic\nand preach to us about how technology can\u2019t save us, and that we\u2019ll just have to change our\nhabits (and all commit to a worldwide lift-share scheme).\nNathan Ley\nScience Editor\n\u201cI am hoping to build on the Science Challenge's already outstanding reach and reputation.\nI genuinely believe that it is an event everyone should in some way or another be involved,\neven if it is just attending the Grand Final.\nWhile the Challenge is a brilliant way for anyone who knows they have an aptitude for communicating\nscience to gain some invaluable experience, I believe it is just as useful for those waiting to unleash\ntalents they never knew they had.\nThis year the Challenge has a few differences as well as a few surprises and I urge you to visit our\nwebsite on www.sciencechallenge.org and find out about the news we have this year, including the\nbrand new \u201cMedia\u201d prize that is now part of the competition.\u201d\n\n"

Angular\nyet polished, shining yet black as the\nunlit night, the previously worthless\nanthracite was becoming the focus\nof one of the world\u2019s greatest minds.\nA pair of well worn hands lightly followed the cleaved boundaries as the\nrock\u2019s discovery was told by an immaculately turned out senator, his tunic\ngolden in the dim illumination, aptly\nmatching the fossilised amber hanging from the Emperor\u2019s neck. Under\nthe all too common canvas, the politician could feel the tangible weight of\nhis superior\u2019s intellect as the details of\nextraction and combustion were di-vulged, almost seeing the birth of industry dancing in those deep eyes; the\nvisions of fully mechanised campaigns\nthat would succeed success in Gaul, life\nfor the populous of the Empire incomparably bettered through plenty and\nluxury, the spread of civilisation into\nthe wild lands.\nHad Marcus Aurelius discovered\nfossil fuels and thus stimulated an industrial revolution akin to ours, population numbers and moderation not-withstanding, the Earth would now\nbe a very different place. A summer\u2019s\nafternoon picnic would not blossom\namongst the delicate flowers of an alpine meadow, but instead be hosted by\na swathe of coarse hardy grass adjacent\nto some hulking shadow of former industrialised glory. Manufactured fungal protein would replace the sumptuous steak sandwiches, and there would\nbe no orange, chocolate or coffee to\namuse the palette. Satiated sunbathing\nwouldn\u2019t be a temptation, the sky having been scorched by some overzealous\ngeo-engineers a number of centuries\nago; fruitless attempts to mitigate rising temperatures.\nFinally the children, instead of running barefoot through\nthe woodland\nand gleefully\nshouting after the wildlife\nthat issued from\nnearby hollows\nand boughs,\nwould chatter quietly on\nBen Fry examines just why things went so wrong, and outlines the possible paths to be taken\nthe verge of the concreted vehicle bays,\neach with their virtual reality glasses\non, taking the \u2018Rainforest Experience\u2019.\nOn returning they ask their equally\nperplexed parents if they remembered\nwhat the forest smelt like.\nIn this parallel history, the short term\ndecisions the Romans took to revel in\na few hundred years of hard earned,\nhigh carbon opulence led to the eventual climatic collapse of various natural\nsystems, bequeathing a forced synthetic future, characterised by grey squalor,\nchange conference in Copenhagen was\na relatively inert agreement that was\na last minute product of two weeks\nof negotiation; a fortnight dominated\nby self-service, short-sightedness and\nconfusion. Although it was the first\ntime that developing countries had\nfound such a strong voice in the global\narena, the resulting \u2018Copenhagen Accord\u2019 lacks any principled substance\n(such as global emissions targets and\nrelated timeframes) that could ensure\nan ambitious, fair and legally binding\nclimate deal. It also is only \u201cnoted\u201d by\nthe UN, not actually adopted, so its\nfunction currently remains unclear.\nThe USA, China, and Saudi Arabia\nare specific parties who have attracted\nsignificant criticism in the Copenhagen fallout, commonly being recognised for respectively ignoring their\nhistoric responsibilities, blocking the\nlegal aspects of the negotiations, and\nmaking all possible moves to disrupt\nconsensus amongst the parties. Rays of\nlight in comparison to these inhibitory\nfossils were the nation of Tuvalu for\nstrongly voicing the need for a comprehensive agreement, Brazil for volunteering significant finance when not\nobliged to, and (once again) the UN\nSecretary General for some remarkable diplomacy.\nAs a process, these are mere tips\nof the beautifully proverbial iceberg.\nThere were many more relationships\nbuilt and lost, hidden discussions,\nleaked documents and impasses than\ncan possibly be described in a coherent\ntext, and this complexity and inherent\ndysfunction is causing a number of\nparties to lose confidence in this entire\npractice, the faith ironically melting\naway with the diagnostic icebergs.\nSo what becomes of the world, particularly those whose ancestors have\nlaboured to create the now drying SubSaharan Africa and the now sinking\nsmall ocean states, while all the talk\ncontinues? Given man\u2019s significant exacerbation of the natural cosmic cycles\nthat have dictated the Earth\u2019s meteorology for billions of years, changes in\nour activities can genuinely change the\nclimatic path of the world. We have\ntwo clear options. We can continue\nwith business as usual, feeding insatiable consumer lifestyles, shying from\npolitical boldness and so condemning future humanity to a narrative of\nstruggle in the spluttering world alluded to earlier. Alternatively the existing suite of world leaders, arguably the\nmost powerful people who have ever\nlived, can use the insubstantial but\nnot meaningless \u2018accord\u2019 as a basis for\nbuilding a strong international treaty\nduring the course of this year, swiftly\nincentivising all sectors to pursue holistic sustainability. Only with clear\nguidance within an accepted paradigm\nwill developed society then consider\nforgoing their \u2018rights\u2019 to unlimited\nelectricity, second cars, new shoes and\nbeef Wellington, in so not jeopardising\nthe longevity of folk capriciously born\ninto less fortunate communities.\nIf we are able to transform our language from the dominating but nar-row, short term economics to one that\ngenuinely values natural and human\nassets, there is yet hope. This very possible alternative unfortunately won\u2019t\nensure the perpetual existence of the\nhuman race, though it would give\nforeseeable generations licence to exist more harmoniously amongst both\nnatural and philosophically bright\ngreenery. THE KEY\nFACTS\n2\nWeeks spent at\nthe conference\n192\nCountries\nrepresented\n0\nLegally binding\nagreements\nTuvalu - with its highest point at only 4.5 metres above sea level, may not be\nwith us for too much longer, but won\u2019t go down without a fight\nto almost a millennia of their earthly\ndescendents. If this parallel story was\nindeed ours, it is curious to think how\nhistory would remember the Romans.\nIf the international climate accord,\nactivities and attitudes remain un-changed, the current cohort of powerful political leaders and subservient\ncivilian voters may become bitterly\nviewed by the coming gen-era- tions. The\nfinal outcome of\nthe\nUN\nclimate\n\u201cHad Marcus\nAurelius discovered\nfossil fuels and\nthus stimulated\nan industrial\nrevolution akin to\nours, population\nnumbers and\nmoderation\nnotwithstanding,\nthe Earth would\nnow be a very\ndifferent place.\u201d Maumoon Abdul\nGayoom of The\nMaldives set the\ntarget for his\nnation to become\ncarbon neutral\nby 2019\nAngela Merkel,\nthe german\nchancellor,\noffered to cut\nCO2 emissions\nby 40% of 1990\nlevels by 2020\nThe president of\nthe USA, Barack\nObama, offered\ncuts of 17% on\n2005 levels of\ngreenhouse gases\nby 2020\nManmohan\nSingh of India\nproposed to\ncut emission\nintensity by 20-25% below 2005\nlevels by 2020\n\n"

So, for\none evening, Imperial College Hindu\nSociety put Hinduism on trial.\nThe renowned guest speaker Rishi\nHanda stood proud in the court room\nto defend Hindu Dharma. In this interactive workshop, Rishi answered to the\ncrimes on behalf of all Hindus, giving\nanswers to questions that no one had\ndared to ask before. Hindus are guilty\nof many acts; many are not even aware\nof why they do them.\nWhen entering the lecture theatre,\nyou could instantly feel the atmosphere\nswimming with questions. There was a\nhuge turnout for this event, by people\nof various cultures, religions and races\nall having a certain curiosity around\nthe unanswered questions surrounding Hinduism. It was time to understand why Hindus have a caste system\nand why they are still male-dominated.\nThe lawyer, Anand Pandit, accused\nthe defendant of being guilty to the following crimes: worshipping idols, being polytheistic, being ignorant in light\nof the suffering of others and segregating society according to heritage and\ngender. The defendant argued from his\nperspective, sometimes adding quotes\nfrom sacred books. For example, when\narguing the polytheistic nature of Hinduism, he quoted Krishna: \u201cThose\nwho are devotees of other gods and\nwho worship them with faith actually\nworship only Me... but they do so in a\nwrong way\u201d (Bhagvad Gita - chapter 9,\nverse 23).\nAs the jury, the audience had the\nopportunity to probe the defendant further, turning the event into an\nopen-floor discussion. Many of the\naudience were intrigued with the topic\nsurrounding male dominance and why\nwomen are seen as being impure when\nmenstruating.\nThis was then followed by a Q&A\nsession, whereby members of the audience asked various questions, including whether or not sex before marriage\nis seen as acceptable in the Hindu cul-ture. The defendant stated that how\nsomeone perceives sex before marriage is a value judgement. However,\nit is regarded as highly spiritual in the\nHindu culture as it is the joining of two\npeople, both physically and mentally,\nin a completely new respect. Rishi\u2019s\nbeliefs are that you should only have\none sexual partner in your lifetime \u2013\nand this should be your spouse. Having sexual partners before marriage\nand then marrying someone different\ncheapens the spirituality of sex \u2013 especially as the person who is not a virgin\ncan be seen as \u2018impure\u2019.\nTo help encourage the audience to\nask questions, there was a prize for\nthe person who asked the best or most\ninquisitive question. Co-president\nMinesh Parmar had a brilliant question about why all of the priests have\ndreadlocks! He had been planning to\nask it for about 2 weeks but unfortu-nately, on the day, his nerves got the\nbetter of him and he was unable to follow through. Para was awarded with\nthe best question inquiring about the\ninequality of women within Hinduism.\nIn my eyes, Rishi was able to justify\nthe actions of Hindus from his own\nperspective of Hinduism and its obli-gations. However, as the answers were\nhis views and his interpretation of the\nscriptures, I feel that for the audience\nto have benefited the most from this\nevent, they needed to have had their\nown opinions on the topics.\nThis would have helped to decide\nwhether his answers were put into the\ncorrect context, thus allowing a deeper understanding of the issues raised.\nAfter all, the audience were the jury\nand so the final verdict rested on their\nshoulders.\nAfter the event there was delicious\nIndian food available for all those who\nattended \u2013 samosas, dhokla and a variety of fruit juices. It was deemed a\ncomplete success because of all the enquiring questions the audience asked\nand the variety of faiths that attended.\nThe hard work that the Hindu Society\u2019s committee had put into the event\nwas evident, and it is an event that the\ncommittee is definitely considering\nholding again. This way, even more\nunanswered questions will have their\nanswers revealed.\nEmail: hindu@imperial.ac.uk\nD\nuring the holiday period,\nImperial College Gliding\nClub visited Portmoak,\nScotland to sharpen up\nour skills. Whilst visiting\nScotland during the winter may sound\nstupidly cold, the airfield we flew at\nhas certain features which recommend\nit: notably the two ridges of Benarty\nand Bishop. For the record, it was stupidly cold.\nNow, it may not sound like a sensible thing to fly around large crashable\nhills, however gliders can use them to\nstay airborne for far longer than anything possible at our home airfield of\nLasham, in winter. There is some\nmethod to our madness. Portmoak is\nalso incredibly pretty.\nThe tour started with an excessively\nlong and boring journey on the 27th of\nDecember followed by the ritual visit\nto Mr Chan\u2019s Chinese restaurant. We\ncan but recommend it.\nThe next day saw our first flights,\nwith our instructor, Andy Cockerell,\ntaking the lion\u2019s share for his instructor check-flights. During the evening,\nwe watched the film Avatar at the local cinema. Not to ruin the plot, but\nnice graphics, pity about the plot: although I appear to be in a minority in\nmy judgement of this film. Apparently\nglider pilots are the jackdaws of aviation with a great love of shiny things.\nThe 29th saw the first flight of the\nclub members \u2013 weak wave conditions over Loch Leven allowed us to fly\nmost of the students \u2013 offering flights\nlonger than most had ever had before...\nIndeed in this day we managed to fly\nfor longer than the sum of all last year\u2019s\nflying.\nRegrettably, the next day was un-flyable as a result of strong winds: to\noccupy ourselves, some of the club decided to climb the Bishop \u2013 and feeling that the path was too horizontal,\nwe opted to ignore it and take a more\nvertical route up the hill. Sadly, some of\nthe members of the group opted not to\nclimb through the metre or so of snow\nat the summit: Ryan, man up. Those\nthat opted to climb up had the fun of\nrolling down \u2013 and that much at least\nmade the ascent worth it; although the\nrandom gentleman wearing nothing\nsave shorts at the top of Bishop at least\nreinforced just how strange Scotland\nis: I would like to draw attention to just\nhow cold it was.\nIn the evening, the group chose to\nsee yet another film, Sherlock Holmes... where club members spent time\nchecking the historical accuracy of the\nbuildings featured in the film; never go\nto the cinema with Imperial students.\nNew Year\u2019s Eve saw more flights, and\na visit to the Edinburgh Hogmanay\nfestival. This was an interesting experience \u2013 with the most unlikely person\nin the group getting groped by ladyfolk\nof Scotland, police kettling and a disappointing lack of alcohol (amongst the\nstudents) who were all keen to fly the\nnext day.\nThe highlight of the evening, mid-night, showed us the true depth of\nhumanity: Auld-Lang-Syne was sung,\nfireworks went off, and some random\nperson in the crowd got hit by a bottle of human waste. Much fun was had\nby all.\nNew Year\u2019s Day was another day of\nexcellent flying, where everyone was\nable to fly and Miles was able to get\na free, two hour flight; he\u2019s not remotely smug about this. The next day,\nwe made our journey back to London,\nwhich was excessively long (due to\ntraffic) and very dull.\nBroadly speaking, we had a superb\ntour in Scotland. The club managed\nto get at least 3 times as much airtime\nA Gliding Club Winter over the lochs and hills of Scotland\nin compared to last year, visited a very\npretty area of Scotland and celebrated\nthe New Year in style.\nSpecial thanks must go to Andy\nCockerell (our instructor), Rory Condon (our guide) and John Davey (our\ndriver) and the University of Edinburgh for lending us their glider for a\nweek.\nThe club had a lot of fun, flew a lot\nand can heartily recommend Portmoak (and gliding): if you want to\nlearn more about our club, visit http://\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/gliding/ .\n\n"

Some of you have had to fight\nsnow and ice, cancelled flights and endless news reports about snow and ice,\nwhile others have had to suffer heightened security at airports following the\nattempted terrorism on a flight bound\nfor Detroit on Christmas Day.\nIt\u2019s become very easy for us to believe,\nas we put our shoes in metal detectors\naround the world and travel in ever\nmore secure modes of transport, that\nwe are the main victims of terrorism.\nThat the global war on terror is a case of\n\u2018us\u2019 against \u2018them\u2019\n, where the \u2018us\u2019 represents the Western World and its liberal\nvalues and the main threat to our security comes from the \u2018them\u2019 \u2013 turban-clad, scimitar-brandishing cave dwellers\nof Victorian fantasy.\nAs convenient as this image may be\nto us as we lace up our shoes and replace our belts, it is a gross and tragic\noversimplification. The automatic assumption that the West is under attack from Islamic terrorism is deeply\nflawed \u2013 it is Muslims who are under\nattack from Islamic terrorism, Muslims\nwho make up the majority of its victims\nand Muslims who are forced to suffer its\nconsequences.\nStudents of history are in the habit\nof referring to the \u2018long\u2019 19th Century\nas the period between the American\nRevolution in 1776 and the outbreak\nof the First World War in 1914. This\nperiod was then followed by the \u2018short\u2019\n20th Century, which spanned the rise\nand fall of fascism and ended with the\ncollapse of communism in 1991. In that\ncase we are due another long Century,\none whose opening number has so far\nbeen mostly concerned with the rise of\ninternational terrorism.\nThe great ideological battle of these\nyears of the long 21st Century is not\nbetween the liberal West and the fundamentalist Muslims. It is between the\nvast majority of peaceful Muslims and a\nsmall but ever-expanding radical fringe.\nThe rest of us are merely the bulletproof vest being battered between a rock\nand a hard place.\nThose of us who live in enlightened\ndemocracies are mercifully safe from\nthe consequences of extremist rule. A\nwoman in London is allowed to drive;\n\u2013 a basic right denied to her sisters in\nSaudi Arabia \u2013 while a homosexual man\nin Paris or New York can escape the\nlashings which await him in Tehran. It\nis the Muslim population which suffers\nmost from many of the sanctions applicable in their home countries, sanctions\ninstituted and defended by extreme interpretations of Islamic law.\nJust as the Second World War was not\nfought against the evils of Germanic culture or Western European civilisation,\nbut against the way in which they were\nabused, the war on terrorism must have\nas its principal target the abuse of Islam\nand its teachings. Because explosive devices on the roads of Iraq and Afghanistan and suicide bombers on planes over\nAmerica or the United Kingdom are not\ndistinct phenomena. They are all indications of the tremendous power held by\nfundamentalist clerics and leaders over\nthe minds of their followers. Many who\nare willing to blow themselves up in\nthe name of Allah are poor, but others\nare rich and well-educated. Some have\nnever left their rural villages, whereas\nothers were educated in prestigious\nLondon universities. Some are peasants and farmers, but others are doctors\nor engineers. The only thing they all\nshare is a tragic receptivity to the dangerous words of ruthless and fanatical\npreachers.\nAs much as we have suffered at the\nhands of terrorists, our losses are nothing compared with the international\nMuslim community. Well over 90% of\nthe terrorism casualties since 2006 have\nbeen Muslim. Some have been collateral\nin the attempt to attack a greater Western target, but all have been victims of a\nschool of thought which regards human\nlife as a negligible factor in the great\nequations of morality.\nEven those Muslims who have not\nbeen personally affected by such tragedies are unable to escape their conse-quences. The automatic assumption of\nguilt by virtue of religious or ethnic association is something that haunts all\nthose with a Middle Eastern passport\nor appearance. Spot checks at airports,\nsuspicious stares and unprovoked displays of fear or aggression are among the\neffects felt by millions of Muslims as a\npunishment for having done absolutely\nnothing wrong.\nBut it is no longer enough to enjoy a\nclean conscience in silence. In the same\nway that Jews around the world feel\nobliged to criticise Israel in order to\nclear themselves of any perceived guilt,\nand Americans by the thousand joined\nfacebook groups entitled \u2018George W.\nBush is not MY president\u2019\n, the tide of an-ti-extremist rhetoric and actions must\nnow come from the millions of moderate Muslims who are currently silent.\nBy refusing to distance themselves\nfrom the fundamentalists, ordinary\nMuslims are encouraging the growth\nand popularity of xenophobic, racist\nand even violent groups who are more\nthan happy to spray all Muslims with the\ngrapeshot of abuse. When we think of\nthose organisations who are most vocally opposed to the rise of Islamic extrem-ism, the Daily Mail and the BNP should\nnot be the names that spring to mind.\nNo individuals have more to lose under the rule of a fascist caliphate than\nthose who will be seen to have \u2018thrown\nin their lot\u2019 with the infidels or kafirs. On\nTuesday\u2019s episode of NewsNight, Anjem\nChoudary (the leader of the Islamist organisation Islam4UK) pointedly refused\nto answer the more moderate Maajid\nNawaaz\u2019s questions about what his fate\nwould be under a Sharia tribunal, sinis-terly hinting that Nawaaz \u2018knew the answer already\u2019\n.\nWhen moderates refuse to push back\nagainst extremism, the tides of fear and\naggression drive ordinary people further\nand further to the political right. It is\nfear of this sort that led to the Swiss ban\nagainst minarets last year, and the recent\ndecision by the Home Secretary to declare Islam4UK an illegal organisation.\nIf we are to make it to the end of the\n21st Century, long as it is is likely to be,\nthose who have most to lose must take a\nstand against those who are most likely\nto take it away. Moderates of all backgrounds need to lead the way if extremism is to be fought.\nGilead Amit appealstothemoderates\n\u201cThose who have\nmost to lose\nmust take a stand\nagainst those who\nare most likely to\ntake it away\u201d\nTell us what you think:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nor leave a comment on the new\narticle discussion feature\nfelixOnline.co.uk relaunches\nIt\u2019s taken a while, but we\u2019re finally online. Properly.\nIt\u2019s a brand new website, created from scratch by us.\nWe need your opinions. There\u2019s a little bit more to do, as you\u2019ll\nsee when you\u2019re on there, so we want to hear your comments\nto help us produce a more polished version.\n\n"
