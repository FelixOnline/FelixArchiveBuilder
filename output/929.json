    "content": "Feature Felix 929 6 March 1992\nThe Arts Week..Gallery\nRunning for three weeks (2nd20 th March) The Arts Week will be\nusing the Consort Gallery (Sherfield\nAnte Room, Ground floor) to\nexhibit the work of a number of\nArtists. The display will include\nprints, paintings and drawings.\nSimon Burder's work is ruggedly\ngeological, an investigation of\ntextures and structures in rocky\nlandscapes. Jeffery Gibbons and\nJoanna Melvin produce abstracts of\npower and considerable feeling.\nRuth Hogg makes prints containing\nThe Arts Week\nexceptionally subtle colour\nshadings. Possibly the most unusual\nwork on show is that of Kaori\nHomma who works with layered\nmulberry paper - sounds interesting.\nThe Arts Week...Classics\nEvery lunchtime (9th13 th March)\nat 12.45 to 1.15pm. Classical music\nwill echo round the Sherfield foyer\nnear the SCR. The rundown is as\nfollows, Monday: An informal Part\nSong Singalong, Tuesday: Bach\nFlute Sonatas with Harpsicord,\nWednesday: Jazz double bass and\npiano duo, Thursday: A selection of\nsongs from Shakespere by Thomas\nArne, with Oboe, Recorder, Strings\nand continuo accompaniment,\nFriday: Bach and Telemann Sonatas\nfor two recorders and continuo.\nAlternatively listen to a string\nquartet and a flute duet who will be\nperforming in the Union Building\nsome lunchtimes during The Arts\nWeek.\nThe Arts Week...Gigs\nThe Mech Eng foyer is hardly the\nvenue you would expect for a Rock\nBand but that is what The Arts\nWeek has arranged for Tuesday\n10th March. Classic rock tracks\nwill be performed by the only band\nwilling to play in a corridor.\nThursday 12th March (lunchtime\nin the Union Lounge) sees the\nreturn of 'Fresh Claim' who have\nper fo med at The Arts Weekfor the\nlast two years. They're back by\npopular demand and no doubt will\nperform some of their classics along\nwith some new material.\n'Trevor Speaks' and Ben Okalore\ncontinue the musical entertainment\non Friday 13th March, again in the\nUnion Lounge. 'Trevor Speaks' are\na duo much in the style of the now\ndisbanded Fat and Frantic. Should\nbe wild.\nThe Arts Week...Comedy\nComedians Mark How and\nRupert Smith will be entertaining in\nthe Union Bar on Wednesday 11th from 8pm onwards, then on\nThursday and Friday lunchtimes (in\nthe Union Lounge) Steve Turner\nwill be the 'poet in residence'. Steve\nTurner has been at The Arts\nWeekbefore and far from being a boring poet has entertained his\naudience with humourous poetry\nfrom his books. This year he will\nuse material from his new book\n(soon to be published).\nThe Arts Week...Busking\nJuggling, reciting poetry,\nsinging, clowning, and all sorts of\nwacky entertainment will be\nhappening round Beit Quad and the\nwalkway throughout The Arts\nWeek. Also on Friday in Beit Quad\nthere will be burgers and hopefully\n(fingers crossed) a bouncy castle.\nMany of the Artists who are\nperforming or exhibiting their work\nare Christian, some perform at\nestablished events like Greenbelt.\nBut don't worry they won't be\nramming religon down your throat,\njust providing the entertainment.\nAll the Arts Week events are free.\nBen Irons, WLC\n(West London Chaplaincy)\nArt\nExhibition, All Day, Every Day\nThe Consort Gallery (Sherfield Level 1)\nClassical Music\nDaily, in Sherfield Foyer, Lunchtimes\nMon - Wed Lunchtimes, in Union Foyer\nPoetry\nPoet in Residence\nThur & Fri, Lunchtime, Union Lounge\nContemporary Music\nThur & Fri, Lunchtime, Union Lounge\nComedy\nWednesday, 8pm Union Bar\nBusking\nLunchtimes, around Campus\nWhen the first 'Arts Week' took\nplace, we were keen on poets but\nwondered how they would go down\nat IC, so we put them on with bands\nto sugar the pill. In the event, the\npoets have been a highlight of 'The\nArts Week'. Last year we had\nthree, and this year decided to invite\nSteve Turner back as 'Poet in\nResidence'. (Is this a new 'The Arts\nWeek' accolade, I ask myself?)\nSteve has just written a new book\nto be published next month by\nHodder & Stoughton. Its called\n'The King of Twist'. I asked for\nmore info (thought I might get a draft), but all I got was the cover!\nStill, the content will be revealed,\nno doubt, at 'The Arts Week' so I suppose he doesn't want to give\nanything away - he might lose some\npunchlines!\n'The King of Twist,' his fourth\ncollection of poetry, combines the\nimmediacy and humour of his\nearlier books with a sharper, more\nmature vision. In these new poems\nhe takes on the fears and pressures\nthat threaten to lead us into a dull\nconformity and explores the 'wise\nmadness' that offers a way out. As\nNME said of his last volume:\n'When you've read this book you\nfeel as if he's given you something\npositive to hang on to in a world so\nuncertain of its uncertainties.'\nWhat the critics say of earlier\ncollections:\n'Steve Turner is witty, there is\nsome sharp wordplay and he\nsucceeds, I think because he\nconfines himself to those subjects he\n\u2022 feels involved in.' Roger\nMcGough\n'Steve Turner's poems should be\nprinted on bus tickets, beer mats, matchbox labels, on giant hoarding s across the city. They are gentle\nslogans for all the causes he believes\nin.' - David Ward, New Musical\nExpress.\n'Within a few pages I felt that in\nhim contemporary London may\nhave found a lyric writer in the way\nthat New York has Steve Sondheim\ni and Liverpool used to have\nLennon..' - Peter Lewis, Daily\nMail'\nI suppose that we should expect\ngood quotes on the cover but, from\nan IC point of view, what else can\nwe say except that last year we liked\nhim so much that 'The Arts Week'\nhas invited him back, not just again,\nbut to do more! You can't get a better recommendation than that.\nCome and hear him on Thursday\nand Friday of 'The Arts Week'.\nPaul Brice.\n\u2014 1 0 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 929 6 March 1992\nWe revolve with it\nDear Adam,\nOn Friday, the 28th of Feb 1992\nthe Overseas Student Committee\n(OSC) celebrated the success of its\nInternational Night '92. A true\ncelebration of the cultural arts, the\nevening kicked off with a food fair\nin the main dining hall followed by\na presentation of traditional and\ncultural items and dances, only to\nclose to the beat of a live African\nband in the main dining hall. A disco was also in full swing in the\njunior common room for those who\nreally wanted to 'get down' to it!\nThe food was excellent, the show\nwas great, the crowd was\nsupportive and no- one would\nDARE to say that they didn't have\na good time. Only problem was\nthat, taking a sweeping glance at the\ncrowd, one could tell (using very\nlittle intelligence) that some sort of\nOverseas, or more Asian to that\neffect, 'thing' was going on.\nThe OSC did an extremely good\njob in publicity and so on and I recall the event was a sell-out. But\nsadly, however, I noticed that the\ncrowd lacked in our European and\neven more so British friends.\nIgnorance can only mean colour\nblindness or illiteracy, as bright\nposters, in English, were posted all\nover the college weeks before the\nevent. As for the tickets being sold\nout, I can only resort to '... if there's a will, there's always a way.' I don't mean gate crash or anything\nto that effect but if people were\nreally interested, they would have\nmade the effort to have enquired\nand obtained tickets much earlier.\nI can only point out blatantly that\nwe have an attitude problem on our\nhands. It's not an Overseas Nite for\noverseas people only, it's for others\nto get to know the various cultures\nand traditions from all over the\nworld. It's about understanding and\ngetting to know people,\nappreciating their backgrounds and\ntheir values, and most important of\nall, having a good time.\nIf you're worried about getting\nbored out of your skull because you\ncan't understand a thing that's going\non, don't be! Take the trouble, ask\npeople around you , I'm sure they'd be more than happy to explain\nwhat's going n.I sincerely feel sorry for those of\nyou who missed out on this\nexcellent event. Union events are on\nyear round and the bars are open\nevery night (besides there was a bar\nopen there too!!) but an opportunity\nto see the cultures of the world\ntogether in one place does not come\nby often.\nI would just like people to sit back\nX HEL Arts Week We're so lucky\nDear Adam,\nIt's that time of year again, isn't it?\nSabbatical elections. Don't you just\nlove 'em? We're so lucky this year\nto be blessed with such an\noverwhelming array of top-notch\ncandidates jockeying for those\ncelestial positions. In the past they\nhave tended to fall into one of the\nfollowing categories:-a) the joke candidate\nb) the candidate who has promised\nto address the current student issues\nand has appeased the minority\ngroups traditionally targeted in the\nmanifestos as post-graduates or St.\nMary's( this year by far the largest\ncategory).\nc) the ex-CCU 'heavy-weight' who\nhas honed their leadership and\norganizational skills beyond belief\nand who feels OBLIGED to serve\nthe students until death do they part\n- commonly known as the\n'has-been'.\nd) the Union hack who has made\nevery attempt to crawl up the arse s of the 'influential s' since coming to\ncollege and has in the process\ncompletely balls ed up their degree.\ne) those who felt that they could\nmake a positive contribution to\nstudent life and actually did. This\ngroup is exceedingly small and is\nin great danger of becoming extinct.\nThis year though the candidates\ntogether form a totally new\ncategory:-f) shite.\nCategories (a),(b),(c) and (d) really get on everyone's tits but they\ntend to be victorious over category\n(e) due to lack of representation. So\nwhat can YOU do to ensure the\ncontinued effectiveness of the\nUnion? Bugger all really. There are\nabout a dozen professional full-time\nstaff who currently coordinate a large proportion of the Union's activities in the financial,\norganizational and social areas.\na moment and think about how\nmuch they know about the people\nand the cultures around them. We\nsee them in the corridors, at lectures\nand even in the street, but how\nmuch do we actually know about\nthem and their way of life. What is\nsymbolic to them and what's not.\nI'm not saying that I know a lot, but\nI sure feel proud to know that I tried.\nRemember, the world does not\nrevolve around us, we revolve with\nit!\nSangkaran Ratnam. Civ Eng 1,\n(Malaysian)\nDegrade\nDear Adam,\nThe RCS Annual Dinner on\nSaturday was a great success- the\nfood, band, booze and especially\nTerry Pratchett's speech were\nsecond to none. Unfortunately a decision of certain male students to\nact completely thoughtlessly meant\na strip-o gram was ordered to\nappear just before the speeches. I don't care how funny the financiers\nfound it, I didn't. As a female I felt\ndegraded and incensed at their total\nlack of respect for any women\npresent. I wonder why they\nbothered to dress so well, when\nthey intended to stoop so low and\nspoil such an evening. Is there any\nwonder there are so few females\nattending I.C., when this is attitude\nthat would greet them when they\narrive?\nLaurie McNamee\nAlong with help from groups such\nas the Ents crew and Felix, and the\nmultitudes of committees, the\nUnion runs smoothly without\nsabbaticals. So why do we have\nthem at all? Unfortunately I'd not\nhave the answer to this, but may I suggest that you vote NEW ELECTION this time, if only to see\nwhether it causes the drastic drop\nin services prophesied by the merry\nband of wasters who have great\ndifficulty in believing that life does\nindeed exist outside the confines of\nthe Union.\nYours with a decent job offer and\ndegree prospects,\nChristopher Adams,\nManagement Science\n\n"

We\nhope you've enjoyed the films as\nmuch as we have.\nAnother month. another\ntournament. Sunday March 1st1992 saw the 3rd Annual Student\nTournament in Fareham\n(somewhere on the coast).\nImperial's 'borderline psychopaths'\nwere there, and in numbers, to\ndispossess Portsmouth Polytechnic\nof the title they've hogged since the\ntournaments started - that of\nNational Student Champions'.\nNot satisfied with just the one\nteam. Imperial sent two. Pitted\nagainst them were Portsmouth Poly.\nBristol University, Luton College\n(see FELIX 14-2-92), Godalming\nCollege, West Kent College and\nAberystwyth. Eight teams in all,\nand it would have been nine if the\nWales team had bothered to turn up.\nNevertheless, there was still at least\none Welsh team to thrash the leeks\nout of (and yet more leek-thrashing\nwill occur, I expect, at Twickenham\ntomorrow).\nAnd so to the paint jobs. Imperial\n1. despite a sterling performance in\nthe unofficial student tournament\nlast month, were only seeded third.\nThis served only in putting more\npressure on the hot favourites. West\nKent. It also heightened Leo\nHappy Boy' Hume-Wright's 'bad\nfeelings'. The curtain-raise r for the\nevent turned out to be the match\nbetween the Imperial teams.\nImperial II started in grand style,\nholding IC I off (for a while) and\neven being ahead on body count. A small miscalculation (small in\ncomparison to, say, a sperm whale)\non their right side let IC I's 'Vague\nBoys' through to grab the flag.\nSixty points to IC I, and a further\nthirty points time bonus.\nScoring for the tournament didn't follow the normal 'points-per-man'\nrule, but relied on speed of victories\nfor bonus points. Therefore, a victory in less than five minutes\ngave a total of 100 points, in less\nthan ten minutes 90 points, and so\non down to 60 points for a( fresh\nand) clean victory.\nWhile IC I had a bye, IC II\nbounced back from their initial\ndefeat by creaming (steady on Mr\nKeogh) Aberystwyth convincingly.\nQuite a stunning result given the\nWelshmen's performance in the\nlatter stages of the tournament.\nPortsmouth signalled their\nintentions of keeping the cup with\na100 point result against Bristol\n(the day's cannon fodder).\nAs for IC I's performance, it got\nbetter as it went on, and on, and on\n(Ariston?). A point of note was IC\nI's performance against the\nWelshmen. At that point, it looked\nlike a closely contested battle for the\ntop three places - between IC I, Portsmouth and Aberystwyth. IC\nI's last two games were against\nthem, and so the final outcome of\nthe placings would depend on IC I's ability to finish in style. And it\nnearly didn't happen against\nAberystwyth.\nIn an action which nearly won\nhim the 'Ponce-of-the-day' (I mean,\nmajor, big-time cretin points)\naward, an Aberystwyth player\nreached into the IC I base to secure\nthe flag, while holding his own flag\nwhich he had just appropriated from\nthe recently-departed Brett 'I'm screaming in more ways than one'\nIverson. Bad move. Own goal. Both\nflags were in the IC I base, and so\nIC scored an easy sixty points from\nthe jaws of an imminent\nembarrassment (of the defeat kind,\nand possibly the nappy kind too -right Luke'?).\nIC I's last game was crucial to IC\nII. They needed to beat Godalming\nin less than five minutes, and hope\nthat IC I did the business against\nPortsmouth, to get into the placings.\nAs it happens, it happened. IC I demolished Portsmouth in a mere\n115 seconds, losing no one, and IC\nII trounced Godalming, leaving IC\nI top of a very sorry, wet (did I mention the Bangladesh-standard\nrain levels?) pile and IC II tying\nwith Portsmouth Poly for second.\nIn an intense but extremely\nsatisfying decider, IC II came\nthrough for second place.\nAnd so Imperial College mauled\nPortsmouth's ego by entering the\ntournament for the first time and\ncarrying away the top two places.\nMore gold-coloured thing ies for the\ntrophy cabinet, and general kudos\n(no, not something you do in white\njam mies in the gym) and back\npatting to all those who turned up\nto kick some bottom. And for once,\nnot IC Il's collective bottoms (nice\nbottoms that they are too).\nAn extra-special mention and\ngrateful thanks to those raunchy\nlove-machines the 'Vague Boys',\nKevin T have an armour y as big as\nmy ego' and Tony 'I'm to sexy for\nthe lot of you but I 'll sleep with you\nall anyway'.\nFinal placings (max 700):\n1st Imperial I610 points.\n2nd Imperial II 330\n3rd Portsmouth Poly 330\n4th Godalming College 320\n5th West Kent College 310\n6th Aberystwyth Poly 290\n7th Luton College 90\n8th Bristol University 65\nTHE F.B.I.

They are coming to 'The\nArts Week' next Friday.\nThe Fat and Frantic concert\nduring 'The Arts Week' 1990\nattracted a large crowd and was\nvery entertaining. Students had\nbeen raving about their music but\ntheir tapes didn't impress me at all.\nHowever, seeing is believing, so it\nis said, and I found them brilliant\n'live'.\nSo when I was sent a tape of\n'Trevor Speaks' and told that\nthey're a bit like the above but\nbetter, I didn't expect to enjoy it.\nA straight tape recording of a duo\nwithout high-tech studio processing\ndidn't appeal to me.

'What's a Science\nFiction convention?' you cry. I can\ntell you because I have been to the\nlast two PicoCons and other cons\naround the country. Essentially a convention is a get together of like\nminded people. In this case we are\nthe people who saw Terminator 2,\nStar Trek 6, and Red Dwarf, and\nread Terry Pratchett and Clarke and\nAsimov. We are also the people\nwho want to visit space, build\nhyper-intelligent machines, or battle\nwith the level ten mage after\nswallowing a bubbling purple\npotion. Alternatively we take pint\nin one hand, book in the other, and\nseek out authors to sign the\naforementioned book, or offer the\npint.\nA usual feature of SF Cons (as\nthey are called) is the Guest of\nHonour. Usually an author or artist,\nthe guest of honour is persuaded to\npart with valuable inside knowledge\nin the form of a 'talk'. Since aeons\nago this talk has been bribed out of\nguests of honour by lubrication with\namber nectar. Two such guests who\nspring to mind are Brian Stableford\nand Dave Langford. Brian\nStableford is a British author of\nsome repute. His long career in\nnovel writing is continuing with the\nrecent publication of 'Empire of\nFear' (a book about the bloody\nexploits of vampires) and the\n'Werewolves of London' trilogy.\nHe is also known for literary\ncriticism in magazines such as\nInterzone and Million.\nslightly distant, an effect I liked,\nthough with too much re verb for\nme.

The\nrhythm haunted me - memories of\n'America'?\n'When I Meets I' is a good one.\nI seem to remember Pete Ward\nrecording this before he met up with\nDanny, and being in a band that\nplayed it. Whatever the treatment,\nthere is something about the verse\nwhich always grabs me, though I didn't like the strumming on this\none.\n'Warm Love' is about what it\nsays, though I didn't catch some of\nthe lyrics. There is a humorous\nreplacement for them in the words\nsheet. A complete change follows\nDavid Langford is also renowned\nfor criticism, but of a less serious\nkind.

Of\ncourse this quiz covers every aspect\nof real and unreal life, such as\nfilms, fantasy, Dr Who, Blake's7, Star Trek and so on. (Whose\nbirthday was on the 12th of January\nin 1992?). You can take part by just\nturning up, and finding a team to\njoin. Hopefully, we will have a panel discussion on 'Self Criticism\nin SF and Fantasy', taking things\nlike HitchHiker's Guide to the\nGalaxy and the work of Kurt\nVonnegut as a starting point.\nAnd that is about it.

They were\ncompletely unprofessional at times\nand fluffed things the way a school\nband might, and than at times they\nplugged into a source of\ntranscendental cosmic gro ovi ness and you thought, hey, man, this is\nlike, totally, like, you know, good\nshit. Their cover of 'House of the\nRising Sun' was firmly in the Good\nShit category, and their original\nmaterial (when you ignored the\nscrew ups) was most certainly\nHeavy Duty Good Shit, I reckon the\nbest stuff I'd heard in ages. The lead\nguitarist, who was kind of furry,\ndistinguished himself by playing\nsome solos which wandered all over\nthe place, but usually got there in\nthe end, very much like a heavily\ntranquil is e dBB King, and that was\nkind of funny. And the versatile\nmale singer/sax player/mouth harp\nplayer was a hip dude with shades\nwho could have passed as a New\nYork pimp. Said dude chose to put\nhis vocal cords through the shredder\nonly on one song, which sounded\nsuperb as a result; the rest of the\ntime he sang he was strictly school\nband level. The female vocalist was\nexcellent. Blue Salamander are a band with a lot of potential, and I'd like to hear them again when\nthey've got more practice under\ntheir belts, and when they have\nsome more original material,\nhopefully of the same calibre as\ntheir present stuff.\nThe Pheasant Pluckers were the\nother end of the professionalism\nspectrum. They played rock\nranging from heavy to hard to\nraunchy to rockabilly with\nincredible Frank Zappa tightness,\nwith routines that were nevertheless\noften slickly improvised between\nband members. Technically, they\nwere effortlessly capable at\neverything they did, and oozed\ncompetence. Pity none of the\nmaterial they did really stuck out the\nway the previous band's did, but the\npeople in the pub (a vaguely rocker\ncrowd) seemed to appreciate the\nastonishing difference in standard,\nand asked for, and got, an encore.\nWorth the two quid.\nPJ\nRight then, sweeties, an especially\nlarge box for you this week,\nbecause you've got an especially\nlong wait until you next have a Felix\nto 'read.' Tonight, The Sultans Of\nPing FC in the Union, supported by\nHerb. Herb are excellent.

Aimed at the 'past it\nand over' age group Melody finds\nitself bridging the generation gap in\nways that only re-runs of\nThunderbirds can. Okay, some may\nargue that the imitation of the latter\nis not as obvious as that of the\nformer from Radio 1 and Capital,\nthese guys are positively human.\nMelody is gonna be big, those\ncultured on high-speed rave music\nare going to tire themselves out and\neasy listening is where they'll go to\nfind their solace, maybe.

    "content": "6 March 1992 Felix 929 Opinion\nPerhaps you were one of the\nmillions of people who dipped into\ntheir pockets and gave money to\nComic Relief last year. But did you\nknow that it only took 8 hours for\nthe \u00a320 million that was raised to\nflow back into Britain in the form\nof debt repayments? This simple\nfact gives the sad lie about aid.\nIt is time that we asked who really\nbenefits?\nBritain spent \u00a31.68 billion on aid.\nIf you were to judge, by\nGovernment statements, or disaster\npictures on TV, you could be\nforgiven for thinking that this figure\namounted to a generous flow to the\nneedy of the 'Third World'.\nPerhaps the image that best sums up\nBritish aid is Lynda Chalker,\nMinister for Overseas\nDevelopment, distributing sweets to\nthe Kurdish children, as they stood\nshivering on the mountains of Iraq:\na 'sticking plaster' solution to much\nmore fundamental problems.\nIn reality, the total amount of\nworld aid is half what Britain\nspends on its social services, and we\nare one of the World's meanest\ncountries when it comes to aid as\na percentage of Gross National\nProduct (GNP). The target set, by\nthe United Nations, is 0.7% of the\nGNP. At the moment, Britain falls\nfar short with its contribution of\n0.31 % and no plans for achieving\nthe full target. If you look at the\nquality and direction of British aid.\nit becomes clear that altruism is not\nthe motivating factor behind the\ngiving.\nMost of Britain's aid is bilateral:\nit involves the direct transfer of\nmoney, goods, or services to the\nThird World. This is a double-edged sword. Aid is an effective\nway of influencing governments\nand furthering the interests of the\ndonors, and is certainly not\nallocated to the poorest countries of\nthe World. In 1985, the year of the\nEthiopian famine. \u00a318 million was\ngiven from the aid budget to repair\na Gibraltarian dockyard. The same\nyear, each inhabitant of the\nFalkland Islands received the\nequivalent of \u00a35,000, whilst India\nreceived only 15 pence.\nBritain also benefits from 'tied\naid', which amounts to about 75%\nof bilateral aid. By tying aid, donors\ninsist that money given can only be\nspend on goods and services from\ntheir own country, and (you've\nguessed), it is usually much more\nexpensive to buy products with tied\naid rather than on the open market.\nRemember the Westland Helicopter\ncrisis of 1986? That year, India was\ntold that it had to spend \u00a365 million,\nfrom its aid money on 21\nhelicopters. These designs were\ntotally unsuitable for the Indian\nconditions: aid had been directed\ntowards helping an ailing British\nindustry!\nIn 1986 Chris Patten, then\nMinister for Overseas\nDevelopment, put it plainly when\nhe noted that the aid programme\nwas 'a significant part of our export\nefforts'. Apart from pure financial\nconditions, tied aid reinforces the\ndependency of the 'Third World' on\nrich countries. Governments are\nforced to import foreign goods and\nthis stops them developing their\nown industries.\nA second part of the 'aid web' is\nmultilateral aid given, by Britain,\nto international bodies, such as the\nWorld Bank, and the United\nNations groups such as the World\nFood Programme. Lynda Chalker,\nin 1990, boasted that British\nCompanies received \u00a31.75 worth of\norders for every \u00a31 that the\nincapacitated that cities are blacked\nout for up to twelve hours per day.\nIn India, many communities are\nprotesting against the Narmada dam\nfunded by the World Bank. It seems\nthat past lessons have not been\nlearnt.\nWhere do we go from here? By\nnow, you may be feeling thoroughly\ndisillusioned but it is important to\nremember that many of the non-Government agencies, such as\nOxfam and Christian Aid, are being\nmore critical of the type of aid they\ngive. Local communities in the\n'Third World' are also getting their\nvoices heard, and the Government\nis increasingly being press uri sed into channelling its aid more\nappropriately.\nIt is also worth putting the aid\nissue into perspective, and\nremembering that it is only a small\nAid; who really benefits?\nGovernment put into\nmultilateral agencies.\nMultilateral aid bodies tend to\nfund large scale, high technology,\nprestigious projects. It is hard to see\nhow the benefits trickle down to the\npoor, whose lives are supposed to\nbe improved by all this aid. Huge\ndams might provide electricity for\nthose who live in towns, but the\nmajority of poorer people in rural\nareas would probably prefer access\nto fuels, such as wood or charcoal.\nThey might argue that sustainable\nforestry would be more appropriate\nto their needs.\nOver the years, enormous sums\nhave been spent on hydro-electric\ndams. These were heralded as the\nkey to developing energy, for local\nindustries, yet little account was\ntaken of the livelihoods of the\nthousands who would be displaced\n. as their land was flooded, or the\nenvironmental damage that such\nprojects cause. The Peligre dam, in\nHaiti (one of the World's poorest\nnations), is a case in point. Only a few years after completion, this\ndam has silted up and is so\npart of the overall picture, at present\naccounting for only 5% of all\nincome in the 'Third World\". World\nprices for raw materials and debt\nrepayments are what really\ndetermine how a country fares. In\n1985 the total amount of emergency\naid to Africa, from all sources, was\naround $3,000 million in debt\nrepayments, and \u00a319,000 million\nwas wiped off the value of African\nexports because of a price collapse\non world markets.\nIt is these forces, rather than aid,\nthat keep poor countries poor.\nChanges are needed in the richer\nmore powerful countries where the\nheart of the problem lies. That is\nwhere organisations, such as Third\nWorld First, come in. By educating\npeople on the root causes of poverty\nand underdevelopment, and\ncampaigning for change here, a valuable start has been made. You\ntoo can help shift the balance of\npower!\nFor further information, contact\nTeresa Garlake, Third World First,\n232 Cowley Road, Oxford OX4\n1UH. Third World\nFirst - what\ndoes it do and\nwhy?

Students\ngroups and hall committees have\ncomplained and protested about\nwhat they regard as a worsening\ncrisis. Imperial Overseas Students\nCommittee voiced their anxiety in\na letter to the man with ultimate\nresponsibility, Gordon Marshall.\nThe letter is quoted from above. On\nFebruary 3rd, high level\nrepresentatives from Selkirk and\nTizard Halls took the death ride to\nSherfield to meet with College\nmanagement on the subject. They\ncame, they talked, they were\nwalked on.\nIt was put to Messrs Fraser and\nMarshall that the quality of Imperial\nCollege residences is such that\nstudents are not receiving value for\nmoney. Mr. Fraser said that next\nThis Old House\nDeclan Curry of\nIC Radio rounds\nup the recent\naccommodation\nproblems\nyear, all rooms in hall would be\nsupplied with an inventory of\ncontents.\nAngus Fraser, Managing\nDirector, and Gordon Marshall,\nDirector of Estates, gave the hall\nresidents the usual treatment. They\nlistened to the question being asked,\nand then answered a totally different\none.\nAccommodation has always been\na problem for the new Ash\nappointed (Ashite) management\nteam. Angus Fraser was appointed\nin November 1989, after 'a year\ntaking stock' whilst remaining on\nthe board of his old company,\nChloride. Gordon Marshall was\nappointed as Director of Estates\neighteen months ago, though he was\nvisible around IC before that.\nMarshall came to prominence\nfollowing the sacking of IC\nBusiness Manager, Tom Stevens,\non 2 November, 1990. Stevens was\nresponsible for the purchase of\nClayponds, in South Ealing, and the\nsimultaneous selling of Montpelier\nHall, a postgraduate residence. The\nplan was that in separate deals, the\nCollege was to sell Montpelier for\nat least \u00a37 million and finance the\nbuilding of Clayponds, for \u00a311\nmillion. The Clayponds shell out\nwent ahead, and then Stevens was\nsacked. No sooner had the axe\nfallen, Montpelier was taken off the\nmarket, so that the legal documents\ncould be scrutinised.\nWhen the college read the\ndocuments, they found that, under\nthe deeds, Montpelier could only be\nused for educational purposes. This\nwrecked the Sherfield financial\nwheeze, and landed accommodation\nwith a \u00a320.5 million debt.\nIs this why IC is throwing\nstudents out of their rooms over\nEaster? There is no better way to\npay off the debt than to let rooms\nover the vacation at conference\nrates of between \u00a318 and \u00a325 a night. If students complain, they are\ntold to go away and learn to read.\nArea residences manager, Graham\nDaniels, told i CNN that 'there isn'ta problem here. These people\n(students) knew exactly what they\nwere signing up for'.\nIf only the Estates Division had\nlearned to read the deeds of\nMontpelier Hall. They had more\ntime to do so than the average first\nyear coming to Imperial, moving\naway from home for the first time,\nand willing to take any\naccommodation on any terms.\nHow much of the blame for the\nMontpelier fiasco can be placed\nwith the Ashite management team?\nAngus Fraser was in his job for a full year.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies Felix 929 6 March 1992\nFinance Business and Investment\nOn 27th February, Ernst and\nYoung, a leading firm of Chartered\nAccountants, invited societies from\nImperial, LSE, Kings and UCL to\nparticipate in their 'Tycoon'\nbusiness game. Naturally, the\nImperial College Business and\nInvestment Society (FBI Soc)\ndominated the event, not only by\nproviding the largest teams, but by\nwinning the competition! But before\nwe gloat, we'll explain what the\nbusiness game involved.\nEach team of 6 students had to\nbid for 20 properties in and around\ncentral London, ranging from\nMay fair to the Isle of Dogs. They\nthen had to decide what they were\ngoing to build on their acquired\nproperties e.g. an office block or a hotel. Next, they had to persuade\na Planning Permission Officer that\nhe was born to approve their\ndesigns. However this was a bit\nharder than it may sound\nconsidering the officer was drunk\nout of his skull! Once this near-impossible feat was achieved, each\nteam had to bid for construction\nmaterials after which they had to\nconstruct their buildings. Next, they\nhad to negotiate with the Estate\nAgents to attract clients to rent their\nproperties. And to add to all this,\nall teams had to constantly beg for\nloans from (as usual) a rather\nunsympathetic Bank Manager! At\nthe end of the game, the team which\nmade the most profit (by having the\nmost valuable buildings and the\nlowest debts) won. The game did\nnot require previous financial\nknowledge and experience, just\nskills used every day e.g. bribery\nand schizophrenia.\nThe first FBI team, FBI1, began\nwell, acquiring two properties at\nlow prices (even though at one point\ntheir members bid against each\nother!). However after that, they\nfollowed the 'BCCI Handbook of\nmanagement'...\nThe second FBI team, FBI2, also\nbegan well, but faltered at the\nconstruction stage, where, due to a shortage of materials, they were\nforced to build a20 storey office\nblock completely out of glass and\nwith no roof!\nThe third FBI the very drunk\nPlanning Permission officer\n\u00a32million to light his cigarette!) and\ndelicate 'interpersonal' negotiations\nwith the Bank manager, they\nsucceeded in making the largest\nprofit and, as a result, won the\ncompetition.\nSince the competition, FBI1 have\nbecome administration of the\nMirror Group Pension Fund, FBI2\nhave accepted the offer to construct\nthe Channel Tunnel, and the very\ntwo properties FBI3 acquired have\nbeen bombed...\nFinal result 1) FBI3 2) Kings 3)\nLSE 4) IndSoc (Imperial) 5) FBI2\n6) LSE 6) IndSoc 7) UCL8) FBI1\n9) Kings 10) LSE Our Thanks to Ernst & Young for\ngiving us a good time and\ncommiserations to all the other\nsocieties who participated. Ernst &\nYoung will be holding a Business\nQuiz and free buffet (worth \u00a35 per\nhead) on Thursday, 13th March in\nRoom 340 Huxley at 12.30pm. Find how much (or how little) you\nknow about business - prizes will\nbe offered to the winning team.\nSailing Away\nThis year has been monumental for\nthe IC sailing team, we have\nactually been winning some races!\nOur crowning ache iv ment was\nlast weekend, with the first team\ntravelling down to Exeter\nUniversity. We were sailing in the\nExeter Excalibur competition,\nsailed in Lark dinghies, and were\nrewarded with a well earned second\nplace. On Friday, everything\nseemed to go wrong on the\ntransport front, but we eventually\nmade it down, albeit rather\nsquashed. On Saturday, we had\nsome fun getting used to the tide,\nbut easily won our first three league\nraces against Reading, Bristol and\nExeter. On Sunday, we faced our\ntwo most challenging opponents.\nWe lost to Plymouth Poly after a disastrous start, including a broken\ntiller. Qualifying for the semi-finals\ndepended on our last race, against\nthe Starcross team, consisting of ex-national champions and university\nteam racers. After another terrible\nstart, we pulled ourselves together,\nkept cool, and capitalised on our\nopponents' mistakes. With some\nfine team racing, we fought our way\ninto a winning position, which we\nheld until the finish.\nHaving qualified for the semis,\nwe faced Oxford II, winners of the\nother league. They had won all their\nraces, but we trounced them\nnonetheless. So in the final, we\nfaced Plymouth again, and despite\na valiant effort in the second race,\ncould not re co er from a bad first\nouting, and so claimed second\nplace, and some rather nice prizes!\nThe other big event this term has\nbeen the London 'Dick', with 24\nteams competing on our home\nvenue, the Welsh Harp Reservoir\nnear Hendon. In a tough league, we\nwon all but two of our races, but\nthe quarter finals were abandoned,\nso we didn't go through. The\nsecond team, consisting of helms\nLiam Moloney, Ben Hancock and\nBen Daverson, plus various crews\nput up a spirited performances, and\nwere unlucky not to beat London II\nand Oxford II.\nLast term was also successful, we\nstarted the year with new boats and\na lot of'enthusiastic team racers. As\nthe term wore on the days become\ncolder, some couldn't cope but a hard core of dedicated sailors\nremained. The main event was the\nLondon 6 Pack again sailed at our\nhome venue, the Welsh Harp. The\nfirst team stormed throught the\nleagues, beating teams from\nLondon, Brunei, Southampton\nInstitute, and Southampton, and\nsailed a fine race to beat Bristol in\nthe quarter finals. However in the\nsemi's we come up against the\nmighty Southamption firsts, and\nexited from the competition losing\ntwo straight races.\nLast term's other important event\nwas the Student National\nChampionships, hosted by\nPlymouth Poly. Winds varied from\nnothing to quite alot, and after two\ndays racing, Angus and Mike ended\nup 27th, with Liam and Ben D37 th from 84 boats. A special mention\nshould also go to Robin and Ben H, both at IC but sailing for London,\ncoming 13th overall.\nAll in all, IC's teams are in better\nshape than ever, we have only lost\nto one university team all year, and\nhave high hopes for the University\nTeam Championships, hosted by\nLondon in April.\nMike Dunbar\nVOTE TO BY JONES 1\nVoting: All departments 9th&10 th March\nFOR A FELIX\nWORTH STEALING\n\u2014 2 0 \u2014\n\n"

A candidate\nneeds more than 50% of the vote to\nwin. If no candidate achieves this\non first preferences, then the\ncandidate with the fewest votes is\neliminated and their votes\ndistributed amongst the remaining\ncandidates according to the second\npreferences expressed on those\npapers.

If this 'candidate'\nwins the election then a new\nelection is called, and the whole\nelection process starts again.\nYou can make your vote more\neffective by expressing all your\npreferences. If your first choice has\ntoo few votes, or even more than\nthe quota (when there is more than\none vacancy), then your vote can be\nused to help elect another candidate.\nPlease note that putting second,\nthird, etc, choices on your ballot\npaper will not affect the chances of\nyour first choice (think about it and\nyou'll see how this is true).\nImportant points to remember\nTreat each election separately,\nusing '1', '2', '3', etc in each case.\nOnly use numbers. Any other\nmarks can invalidate your vote.\nMake sure you start at 1, and only\nuse each number once.

Widely tipped to take\nover from her husband in the event\nof his demise, and for the most part,\neven more of an extremist than he\nwas, she had acquired a reputation\nas an organic chemist of\ninternational standing. Having\nattended many symposia and being\nawarded many honorary degrees\n(including one from the Polytechnic\nof Central London) it was\nsubsequently found that she was\nscarcely literate and had not even\npassed out of primary school.\nThe rest of the family all received\nlong prison sentences, the exception\nbeing their son Nicu, who is of\ninterest here because he graduated\nfrom Imperial College in 1971 with\na third in Physics. Possibly the only\nhonest member of the family, he\nnow has gainful employment as\nboss of a hydro electric plant.\nFollowing Christmas a situation\nnot un similar to the French reign of\nterror was instigated. Large scale\nsocial disorder saw gangs of miners\nfrom the Romanian equivalent of\nthe NUM wandering the streets\nproclaiming to be the Police of the\npost revolutionary republic. The\nreality was different. Hundreds\ndisappeared in reprisals and score\nsettling for 40 years of communist\nrepression, and it was not\nuncommon to see people beaten to\ndeath in the streets. Particularly\nhated of course were the Securitate,\nthe plain clothes secret police,\ninstantly recognisable by their\nyellow number plated cars, the big\nbrother that could beat and arrest\nyou for major economic crimes\nsuch as possession of five American\ndollars.\nRomania had always been the\nMaverick of the Eastern block\nstates. The only Soviet satellite\nnever to have foreign troops on its\nsoil, Romania had constantly been\nat odds with its large neighbour.\nPublically condemning the\ninvasions of Hungary and\nCzechoslovakia, Ceaucescu had\ngained a reputation as a skilled\ndiplomat by organising the Camp\nDavid talks in 1976 between Begin\nand Sadat. A state visit to Britain\nfollowed, accompanied by the\nQueen, who full of smiles in public,\nin private made references to 'that\nloathsome little man'.\nCeaucescu then chose to follow\nhis own particular brand of\ncommunism. A staunch Stalinist,\nupon assuming power he\nimmediately instigated a programme\nPossession of\nfive American\ndollars was a major crime\nof economic austerity. One of the\nmost bizarre measures of course,\nwas his policy on population.\nRomania is not a large country. It\nhas a population of about 22\nmillion, in an area greater than the\nUK. It's economy has always been\nheavily based on agriculture. In the\n1970s Ceaucescu became obsessed\nwith paying off the national debt.\nAgriculture was kicked up a gear\nand massive export of produce and\ngoods was instigated. For a short\ntime Romania became the only\n\u2014 12\u2014\nFelix 929 Feature\ncountry in the world not to have a foreign debt. Ironically, whilst\nsmall surges of democracy were\noccur ing in other Eastern states (eg\nthe emergence of solidarity in\nPoland), these states were not given\neconomic help by the west, whilst\non the say so of America, Romania\nwas accorded most favoured nation\nstatus by the Western trade\nalliances. A condition of this\nwiping their backside with Moses\nand Jesus.\nThe upgrade of agriculture was\nconcurrent with abolition of the\ntraditional farming system and\ncentralisation into 'a gro industrial\ncomplexes'. Fifth generation\nfarmers suddenly found themselves\nliving in tower blocks, stripped of\ntheir land. Of course, manpower\nwas needed to feed the a gro Dr Adriana in the drug less pharmacy\nagreement was that Romania take\nand distribute 100,000 Bibles.\nThese were subsequently taken, and\nrecycled into toilet paper, which is\na precious commodity in Romania.\nThe recycling was inefficient, text\nwas still visible in the paper, and\nRomanians used to joke about\nindustrial machine, and here we\ncome to the most distressing\nepisode of Romania's modern\nhistory.\nA complete ban on birth control\nwas instigated, accompanied with\nabortion being made illegal. Tax\nconcessions and medals were\navailable to any woman who could\nproduce 5 children.\nIt was not uncommon in peasant\nfamilies for 10 or 12 children to be\nborn, and abortion was merely\ndriven into the backstreet s. The\nmost amazing case I came across in\na local hospital was of a woman\nwho had had 5 abortions in one\nyear, she was lucky. Death from\nseptic a emi a was common, as was\nsterility. Almost complete ab sense of antibiotics and anaesthetics\nexcept for those stolen, smuggled\nor imported did not help.\nThe result was obvious,\nThousands of births, massive\nincidence of sexually transmitted\ndiseases and when the government\nfinally got around to admitting to it,\nrocket ting levels of HIV infection.\nLife in Romania is sometimes hard,\nbrutish and short. Of course the\norphanages began to fill up, as did\nhomes for the mentally and\nphysically handicapped. Perhaps\nmore alarming were the institutions\nfor adults. From my experience in\nthese places it seems that\ncommit able offences included rape,\ninsanity, alcoholism, having\nsy ph yl is, not being married by the\ntime you were a woman of 32 and\nnot agreeing with the economic\npolicies of the government. More\nfrightening is the fact that these\npeople are still there. After the\nrevolution a large amount of paper\nshredding took place including\nmany signed release notes. The\norphanages were of a similar type.\nI asked some of the children Unde\neste ta familia? (where are your\nfamily), to which a standard answer\nwould be Nu Stiu (I don't know).\nThose that did know did not have\nmuch good news ('My mother had\na heart attack and a tree fell on my\nfather's head').\nThe government had been clever.\nThe orphanages and mental\ninstitutions of Romania are split up\ninto possibly 800 sites dotted all\nover the country. Tucked away in\nthe mountains, staffed entirely by\nthe population of one village, who\nwere anxious to keep their own\njobs, a veil of secrecy was drawn\nover these places so that the vast\nmajority of other Romanians did not\nknow about them.\nStaffed by the ignorant and the\nuntrained, these places became\nbreeding grounds for neglect and\nmisery.\nIndeed it is thought that even\ntoday there are some of these\ninstitutions in remote locations\nwhich have not yet been discovered\nby western aid organisations.\nAfter the first televison crews\nmade their forays into these places\na massive programme of fund\nraising and relief work was\ninstigated. Indeed take a flight from\nLondon to Bucharest today and the\nlikelihood is that half the poeple on\nthe flight will be going there for this\nreason.\nOf course the initial days were\nnot without problems. Large\namounts of aid were and still are\nstolen. An associate of my views\nthis philosophically as part of the\nproblem when you 'send the hungry\nto feed the starving'. I have to\nagree, another friend of mine, who\nwas the first British nurse into\nRomania after the revolution says\nthat perhaps we should not moral is e considering that every year \u00a35\nmillion worth of equipment is stolen\nfrom the National Health Service.\nStill it must have been disconcerting\nto have your equipment stolen the\nsame night that you bring it, and\nthen be offered it for sale to you the\nnext day in the local market, as\nhappened to several groups.\nMy first trip to Romania was last\n/ was reminded\nof the Nazi\ndeath camps summer, with an expedition from\nthe University of London St Johns\nambulance group. The expedition\nincluded another student from IC\nand a large number from Mary's.I can only speak for myself when\nI say that what I found in certain\ninstitutions sickened me. Of course,\nnever having been there it is\npossibly unfair for me to make a comparison but I was reminded of\nthe Nazi death camps. The asylum\nat Costina\u2014200 men and women,\nof all ages. Forced to sleep two or\nthree to a bed, with no day care\nfacilities at all. The prospect of a cold bath once every three to four\nmonths (there was no running\nwater), and a change of clothes\npossibly once every six. Complete\nlack of sanitary protection for the\nwomen (they were in the habit of\nholding their hands over their\nvaginas to stem the flow of\nmenstrual blood and then eating by\nhand from a communal food bowl).\nAt first the dormitories were\nmixed\u2014sexual abuse, rape and\npregnancy were common.

These\nare attended by students from all\nuniversities within the BEST network and include cultural and\nsocial programmes, enabling the\nparticipants to learn about and\nexperience their surroundings.\nThe two main goals of the\nprogramme are:\n\u2022 To increase the undergraduate\nstudent exchange in Europe.\n\u2022 To promote the importance of\ninternational cooperation.\nThe practical benefits include:\n\u2022 A unique two week cultural\nexchange with most European\ncountries.\n\u2022 An opportunity to experience\nstudent life in a very different\nsociety.\nsports competitions, international\nforums and debates. Just to name\na few of the possibilities.\nStudent Exchanges\nThese can be of all types. In the past\nthey have ranged from one day get-together s to year-long studies.\nSome members have gone as far as\nto complete their whole degrees\nabroad.\nIn general, increased\nundergraduate student mobility has\nbeen achieved through closer\ncooperation amongst the different\nschools.\nCultural Awareness\nBEST has constantly been a mediator between cultures, uniting\nstudents with different backgrounds\nand with them their universities.\nThus opening a wide and new array\nof ideas and possibilities.\nStudents have learned to better\nappreciate their own schools and\nhave been inspired to strive towards\na greater understanding of other\nstudents' lives.\nInterested?

    "content": "Editorial Felix 929 6 March 1992\nThe newspaper of the Polytechnic\nof Central London. McGarel had a report this week on the theme of\nacademic establishment name\nchanging, one of the many bees in\nmy bonnet. In defence of my\nindefensible plagiarism, I should\nsay that McGarel seems to have\ndone a lot of research on the subject\nand replication of the same would\nbe pointless (please don't sue - we\nain't got no money). In addition I have nothing to write about this\nweek.\nThe whole subject of name\nchanging ought to be viewed with\namusement rather than anxiety - in\naddition to those already mentioned\nwe have the following polytechnics\ntrans mutating Hatfield to the\nUniversity of Hertfordshire, Leeds\nto the Leeds Metropolitan\nUniversity. South West to the\nUniversity of Plymouth, Thames to\nthe University of Greenwich. City\nof London to the City of London\nUniversity (as opposed to the City\nUniversity, which already exists),\nthe Poly of North London to the\nUniversity of North London,\nsimilarly for the Polys of East\nLondon and of West London. Bang\ngoes my theory that Imperial will\nbecome the University of West\nLondon.\nYou may or may not be aware of\nvarious rumours whizzing about to\nthe effect that Student Unions may\ncease to be a 'closed shop' as part\nof the Conservative Government's continued campaign against all\nthings Scargillesque. This is termed\n'voluntary membership of a union'\nand would mean, in effect, that the\nfunding which now automatically\ngoes to Student Unions would go to\nindividual students. Something like\nan extra \u00a35 per year for each student\n- which could be used to join the\nUnion or to buy x pints of beer,\nuntil the Government decides to cut\nthis money as well. The reasoning\ngoes that\na) all students are part of the\nNUS - the National Union of\nStudents;\nb) NUS is but one letter\ndifferent to NUM; c) both tend towards the\npolitical left:\nd) closed shops contravene the\nlaws of heaven and earth, therefore\ne) they should be heavily\nstomped on.\nThere are a number of flaws in\nthis argument -a) not all students are part of\nthe NUS, thank god. For instance,\nIC students aren't.b) this is entirely true.\nc) this is also true, but in the\ncase of the NUS they are doing an\nexcellent job of destroying\nthemselves. They need no help.\nAnyway, being generally leftie is\nnot a good reason to be dumped on\n- I draw your attention to the NHS\nSultans of Ping\nIf you've got your ear to the\nground, you'll have heard 'Where's me Jumper?' by Cork's Sultans of\nPing FC.

Advance tickets are only\n\u00a32.50, \u00a33.00 on the door. This is\nthe most prestigious gig at IC since\n(I feel that the Conservative Party\nCental Office policy may be to\nabolish all three letter acronyms\nbeginning with 'N').d)I am ambivalent on this. If\nit came to a choice between a student Union and several scores of\npackets of crisps, your average\nstudent would go for the latter. If\nthat is want they want, I feel it\nwould be arrogant to preach\notherwise, though it is very\nshortsighted to bankrupt your own\nstudent Union only to realise later\nthat quite possibly it may have been\nuseful.\nThe blame for such disinterest in\nthe Student Union lies partly with\nthe Union itself, in that it is not seen\nas 'worth its salt.' the blame for\nwhich, in turn, lies with the student\npopulation for not getting involved\nin it. or being aware of what the\nUnion does. Should the Union\nbecome a vast self public ising machine' I think not.\nPerhaps if the students here were\nto vote with their money in the\nfuture and abolish the Student\nUnion, that is totally reasonable.\nAfter all. it would be true\ndemocracy. You decide who next\nyear's Sabbaticals will he - so you\ndecide how well next year's Union\nwill run.

    "content": "Issue 929 6 March 1992\nElections Drop Soc\nA number of Imperial Students hung from a tree in Hyde Park last\nWednesday to raise money for an expedition to the Pamir Mountains\nin the former Soviet Union. One of the students said that the purpose\nof the expedition was to 'do some climbing' and explore one of the\nlast wildernesses in the world. The expedition is hoping to raise\n\u00a313,400 to fund itself.\nImperial College Union sabbatical\nelection candidates received a difficult reception from St Mary's students, and the relevance of ICU\nelection rules are in question\nfollowing Monday's hustings. The\ncandidates fielded questions from a cynical audience which believed\nthat the candidates' interest in St\nMary's affairs was due simply to\nthe election. ICU President, Zoe'\nHellinger, has called for a review\nof the election regulations following\nclashes between students and the\nelectoral Returning Officer.\nThe anger of St Mary's students\nat the alleged lack of interest from\nIC was focused by a non-directed\nwritten question submitted to all\npresidential candidates. The\nquestion asked why none of the\ncandidates felt it necessary to talk\nto Mary's students. It then further\nreminded the candidates of Ben\nTurner, a previous candidate who\nwas defeated at the first ballot after\nremarking that St Mary's was\nunimportant.\nCandidates were ridiculed when\nthey claimed that they had an active\ninterest in the affairs of St Mary's. Howard Jones, a Presidential\ncandidate, was cross examined\nfrom the floor after replying that not\nonly did he think it was important\nto consult with St Mary's, but he\nhad also done so. Toby Jones, a Felix candidate; was later\n'f lang oed' by St Mary's Rag.\nAngelo Gardini, running for\nPresident, replied that 'of course\nMary's matters', at which point a member of the crowd called out,\n'only when you want our votes'.\nWhen Mr Gardini suggested that St\nMary's students should come to the\nIC Union office when they had\nproblems, he was asked why he\ncould not come to the St Mary's Union office.\nChris Davidson, running for\nPresident, said that any answer to\nthe question would be seen as\nelectioneering, but that if anyone\nwanted to talk to him, they could\ndo so after the Karaoke evening in\nSt Mary's union building.\nThe candidates were also\nquestioned on their knowledge of St\nMary's affairs. Topics which came\nup repeatedly were Wilson House\nand the original St Mary's merger\ndocument, which was described by\nMr Gardini as 'irrelevant'. Cries of\n'vote new election' were clearly\naudible after Mr Gardini's questioning.\nProblems with the restrictive\nnature of electoral coverage rules\ncame angrily to the fore at the end\nof Howard Jones' directed\nquestions. The established format of\ntwo minute speeches followed by\nwritten questions was repeatedly\nchallenged from the floor during the\ncourse of the evening. Students\ncriticised the limited number of\nwritten questions, which were\nvetted by the elections committee,\nand claimed the entire proceedings\nwere undemocratic.\nTurbulent scenes developed as\nstudents argued with the election\nReturning Officer, Steve Farrant.\nAt one stage. Mr Farrant was\nreferred to as a 'bureaucratic\nbastard'. Simon Stockhill, President\nof St Mary's Students' Union,\nremoved the microphone from Mr Farrant to carry out a head count of\nthose in favour of open questions\nfrom the floor. Mr Farrant later\nhanded control of the meeting over\nto Mr Stockhill.\nThe dissension began when Mr\nFarrant objected to a move to open\nthe hustings to the floor. To cries\nof 'why, why?', he pointed out that\nsuch a move was 'against election\nrules'. This interpretation was\n.Challenged by Ms Hellinger, who\nsaid that 'after two minutes per\ncandidate, they (students) can ask\n(the candidates) any questions they\nlike'. Ms. Hellinger then warned\n'Steve, seriously, we're just causing\nannoyance', and was later heard to\nremark that it was time to review\nthe election regulations.\nHoward Jones told the students to\nvote for him or New Election. 'It's your only hope,' he said. In\nresponse to a written question,\nAngelo Gardini said that 'gay and\nlesbians ... have a damn hard time',\nand added that if anyone wanted to\nset up a gay and lesbian society, he\nwould 'try and smooth the way for\nthem'. Chris Davidson said that he\nwas 'not doing it for the\nmoney.. .not doing it for the power'.\nSt Mary's students also raised\nobjections to plans from some\ndeputy president candidates to cut\nthe price of beer. The Deputy\nPresident can only request that bar\nprices be cut. They do not have the\nauthority to enforce a price cut. St\nMary's reminded candidates that\nthey have a separate licence to that\nof Imperial College Union, and so\nthe Deputy President has no\nauthority in this field whatsoever.\nSt Mary's students also defended\ntheir right to determine their own\nEntertainments programme.\nFelix editor candidates were\nheavily slated for the newspaper's lack of interest in St Mary's affairs.\nThe candidates were asked when\nFelix last published 'something\npositive'. The current Felix editor,\nAdam Harrington, later refused to\ncomment on the criticisms raised by\nthe St Mary's students. (i CNN) Voting in all departments 9th and 10th March\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 929 6 March 1992\nA case of advanced syphilis in Costina asylum\nAbove all the overpowering\nstench. It had not been uncommon\nfor dead bodies to be left lying\naround for large periods of time.\nYet again the thought crossed my\nmind of what the Allied forces did\nwhen they opened the gates of\nRavensbruck and Auschwitz. In\ncertain instances I could have quite\nhappily machine gunned the lot of\nthem.\nThe orphanage at Ionaseni housed\n200 children with a wide range of\nphysical and mental handicaps.\nWhen the first British group had\narrived here they had been told by\nthe locals Tt is better that you leave\nthese children to die\u2014they are\nnothing more than animals'. Several\nmonths later a convoy of trucks had\nbeen surrounded here by 250 angry\nvillagers demanding relief aid for\nthemselves. Some swift diplomacy\nresulted in loss of clothes and food\nin return for retention of essential\nmedical supplies.\nIn the winter it had not been\nuncommon for one child a day to\ndie here, exposed to the - 3 0 \u00b0 C blast that comes straight from\nSiberia to the North. The bodies\nwere saved up in the morgue for a mass burial on Saturdays. The death\nrate here was reduced by almost\n100% by the simple expedient of\nputting some glass in the windows.\nInside you might have been\nforgiven for thinking that the\nchildren were animals. Yet again\nwith two or three to a cot it was not\nuncommon for children to be 8\nyears old and not be able to walk\nand speak. One of the more pitiful\nexamples I saw was of a sixteen\nyear old girl, whose age I incorrectly guessed at 8 because of\nher diminutive size, holding a kitten. She had just had a baby by\none of the orphanage boys and had\nbeen told that she could keep the\nbaby when she could look after the\nkitten.\nNow of course the situation is\ndifferent. An army of occupational\ntherapists, speech therapists and\ndoctors from Britain is working full\ntime there and getting amazing\nresults. Anyone who has seen the\ndocumentary 'Challenge Anneka'\nand seen the before and after results\nof the orphanage at Siret will be\nfamiliar with what a little hard\nwork, patience and above all\nunderstanding can achieve.\nMy own institution for this\nChristmas was in a place called\nZvoristea. Right in the North of the\ncountry, it sits about ten miles from\nthe border with Soviet Moldavia.\nThis part of the world is not having\nit particularly good at the moment.\nWith the break up of the USSR,\nspiralling inflation, the Russian\nwinter and an average wage of three\ndollars a month, life is more of an\nexistence than an enjoyable\nexperience. The only people\nmaking any serious money are\nbusinessmen, priests, taxi drivers\nand whores (6 dollars all night for\na good looking one so I'm told).\nSet in this gua g mire is the special\nschool. Two hundred children\nincluding 80 orphans in vacation\ntime. They get a basic education\nuntil the age of 16 when they are\nsent to another school to be trained\nin vocation skills such as metalwork\nor shoe making. A programme of relief work has\nensured that for the most part, the\nchildren get enough to eat, and have\nshoes when they run about in the\nsnow. The main problem in places\nlike this is that the children lack the\nnecessary mental stimulation to\ndevelop properly. As any biologist\ncan tell you the human brain\nreaches its maximum level of\nsophistication at about the age of\nthree. Absence of such basic forms\nof interaction such as play can have\na profound effect on the child in\nlater life. Romania has a particularly bad human right's record in this field. After the war\nthe International Charter for human\nrights for children was set up,\nwhich included a clause stating that\none of the basic rights for children\nwas the right of play. Romania\n(although she was not alone),\nrefused to sign this clause. At the\ntime Eastern bloc states were in the\nhabit .of removing children from\nparents at an early age to be\nindoctrinated in the 'socialist way\nof life'. Presumably play did not\ncome into this. The effects of this\nsort of dep rival are very distressing\nto witness. Children will sit in\ngroups and rock to and fro for hours\nbecause they have nothing better to\ndo.\nThis situation is not irreversible\nthough. It is quite astounding to see\nthe progress made in a child by\ngiving them paper and crayons and\nasking them to be creative. The\nlearning of life skills that we would\ntake for granted is also very\nnecessary, for instance how to flush\na newly installed toilet, or that\nwiping your arse on the floor is not\nhealthy. The education does not end\nthere however. Persuading the\nsupervisors not to beat the children\nwith iron bars is also sometimes\nvery necessary.\nChristmas at the orphanage was\nfun and the New Year even better.\nThe Romanian New Year has to be\nseen to be believed. The festivities\nlast about a week. The entire\ncountry takes to the streets, dressed\nup as goats and bears going from\ndoor to door where by unwritten\nlaw they must be received with\nhospitality, which normally\ninvolves large quantities of vodka\nor t suica, which is Romanian plum\nbrandy brewed illicitly in stills in\nthe back garden.\nIn Romanian folklore, whenever\na bear appears in a story it is always\ncalled Martin, in the same manner\nin which foxes are always called\nReynard in France, or Brer Rabbit\nin Uncle Remus etc. For this reason\nI was soon christened by the\nIt was not\nuncommon for\none child a day\nto die here\nchildren as Mors Martin (old man\nbear). The villagers soon became\nused to the sight of 'the crazy\nBritish', roaming through the streets\nof Zvoristea, accompanied by\ndroves of small children, screaming\nloudly, only stopping to torture\nlocal cats or make demands for\nsweets or ice cream.\nThe community Doctor soon\nbecame my good friend. A fluent\nEnglish speaker, she was constantly\nhampered in her ability to practice\nmedicine by the fact that she could\nnot get the appropriate drugs. One\nof the more touching examples was\nthe day I was able to supply L Dopa\nto a local man with chronic\nParkinsonism. Three days later his\nsymptoms had improved\ndramatically, and presents started to\nappear from the village for me.\nAlas it was all too soon time for\nme to return to London and\n'normality'. But I will go back, as\nwill hundreds of other volunteers\nwho find the people and the country\naddictive. However this takes hard\ncash. To send the group from\nMary's and IC last summer cost\nover \u00a35000. This year it would cost\nmore. If in the depths of your\nstudent debt you could spare the\nprice of one pint of beer to help\nwhat is known now as the fourth\nworld, you could rest safe in the\nknowledge that your money will be\ngoing to a very good cause.\nIf you think you could help out\nor would like to know more about\nwhat is happening in the Romanian\norphanages please contact:\nMartin Heighway,\nC/O RCSU Office,\nImperial College.\nor\nSimon Stockhill,\nSt Mary's Union Office.\n\u2014 14\u2014\n\n"

He is one of\nAmerica's most influential and\npioneering colour photographers.\nHe lives in the deep south and this\nis reflected in most of his work.\nThe exhibition features nine\nthemes: Graceland, Southern\nSuites, Election Eve, Interiors,\nWedgewood Blue, The Louisiana\nProject, Industry and an African\nTrilogy. I found there to be nothing\nprofound in most of his work, it was\nsharp yet dull in content and\ncomposition. The work is all of a similar vein, the subjects being\nmainly objects of modern living and\nthe nature that surrounds us.\nTo me this made for rather boring\nviewing. The intensity of colour in\nthe photographs raises the subject\nout of its mundane ness and the\nquality of a 'snapshot'.\nEggleston is undoubtedly a professional with flawless\nGogh's favourite artists. Alongside\nthese works are a few of Van\nGogh's own. The pieces displayed\nare Peasant Heads 1884, Weavers\n1885. A Pair of Boots 1886 and\nRoad Along the Seine at Ansiers\n1887. together with extracts from\nhis letters and personal\nmemorabilia.\nAs you may have guessed, this\nexhibition boasts the credibility that\nhis time spent in England helped\ncreate Van Gogh-the artist.\nAGA. technique.\nAfter walking round the\nEggleston exhibition having studied\neach photograph intently and having\ngiven serious thought to it (believe\nme if you like), there was enough\ntime to inspect the Van Gogh\nExhibition on the lower floor.\nThe exhibition focuses on Van\nGogh's formative years when he\narrived in England at the age of 20,\nin 1873. At that time he was\nworking for art dealers in Covent\nGarden.\nThe major part of the exhibition\nis a selection of paintings by Van\nThese exhibitions are at the\nBarbican Art Gallery.\nRoman and Mary's Last Friday I went along to see this\nplay at the Theatre Offstage in\nCamden (I hate Camden). The\nRoman is the Roman soldier who\nguarded Jesus on the night before\nhe was crucified and the Marys are\nMary Magdalene and the B. V.M.( that's the Blessed Virgin Mary for\nyou heathens). Anyway, kinda\ntopical with Lent and all that\n(what's Lent cry the heathens!).\nWell let me say first and foremost\nthat this is an excellent play. I was\ngripped. It is mainly Mary M and\nthe B. V.M. telling their stories.\nMary Magdalene had a sad old time\nand suffered all the abuses that men\ncan sling at a woman. And then she\nmet Jesus. She describes the abuse\nand pain of her life with graphic and\nchilling words and her soft s couse accent is great (to be said/read in\ns couse). Well, I liked it anyway.\nShe met Jesus and she felt clean\nagain, and she saw love and warmth\nin his eyes.\nMary Magdalene and the B VM( title courtesy of Jojo)\nIt all sounds quite orthodox up to\nnow. But Christians beware. Waly\nK. Daly has a new way of looking\nat the B. V.M. story and opens the\nquestion as to who Jesus was.\nActually, the B. V.M. comes across\nas a cow of mega proportions. She\ncertainly believed her son to be the\n,son of God and was gonna make\ndamn sure that all went according\nto plan (God's plan that is). The two\nMarys hate each other 'cos they\nboth see Jesus in different ways.\nI suppose this play could offend\nchristians but personally I think a challenge of ideas and beliefs is a good thing. Even if you're not into\nthe theological significance of the\ntheme, just go for the brilliant\nperformances of Barbara Ewing and\nHelene Kvale, the moving\nsoliloquies and the powerful\nwriting.\n\u00a35 for us poor folk and the 31 bus\ntakes you all the way.

'The\ngreatness of a writer is in direct\nproportion to the power of his\ncountry,' said Louis Bunuel and so\nwe miss out on brilliant writers just\nbecause they're not American or\nBritish (or Russian or German )\nTherefore, The About Time\nTheatre Company deserves credit\nfor staging 'Blood Wedding' by the\ngreat Spanish poet Frederico Garcia\nLorca. But it is always a challenge\nto make a foreign play work and\nI'm afraid this production does not\nsucceed.\nIn the play, a bride runs away\nwith her former lover at the end of\nthe wedding ceremony leaving\nbehind her and the bridegroom's stunned families. Lorca had read\nabout such an incident in a newspaper years before he wrote\nthe play. He turned the theme into\na highly poetic, surreal drama, and\na very Spanish one indeed. The\ndirector, Yuval Zamir, is mistaken\nwhen he thinks he could eliminate\nSpain from the play and replace it\nwith mere art in ess. Its setting is half\nimaginary anyway, featuring\ncharacters such as The Moon and\nDeath. If you take away its Spanish\nculture, its link to the real world,\nthen how can you believe the story?\nI was left completely untouched.\nThey murdered the play.\nWhat makes it really painful is the\nacting (with the exception of\nMichele Hunter as the servant\nwoman, the only living character on\nstage.)\nBoris\n\u2022 Blood Wedding, About Time\nTheatre Company, The Bridge\nLane Theatre, Bridge Lane,\nBattersea.

    "content": "6 March 1992 Felix 929 Music\nTho us and Yard StareAstoria\nTrash, Helium\nDivers\nArriving late (Due credit to London\nUnderground for that) I entered the\nAstoria to find those crazy Corkish\n(?) maniacs, The Frank And\nWalters, halfway through their set.\nConsequently, I know not what\nSpin were like, or whether the\nFrank & Walters played their cover\nof 'Love Is In The Air.' Oh well.\nWhen I got in, they were halfway\nthrough the lead track of EP2,\n'Fashion Crisis Hits New York',\ntheir purple and orange flares\nbillowing in time with the music.\nStepping up to the mic, they say\nFrank and\nWalters\n-EP3\nAnother creative title from Cork's finest export, the EP opens with\n'Happy Busman', which is about a guy called Andy James, who 'drives\na bus' hence the bus man part, and\nwill 'make the whole world smile',\nhence the happy part. A very public\nspirited approach to life, and a bit\nof a stomping song. Followed on\nwith 'Humphrey', who thinks\neveryone should 'study mime'.\nAnother distinctly storming song,\nthough not quite as good as the first\ntrack.\nOn the other side (if you buy it\non vinyl, and remember, I do want\nyou to buy it) is the best est track\nyet, 'The World Carries On', and\nthen 'If You're Still Waiting'. If\nyou're still waiting, out of sheer\npoliteness to the lecturer who\nyou're not listening to, then make\na mental note in capital letters to go\nout on Monday and buy it. Get into\nthe orange and purple scene. I will\nbe making spot checks on Monday\nafternoon, just to check that you\nhave done as you're told.\nFrankly, dear heart, it's Corking.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 EP3 is released on Monday on\nSetanta/Go Discs. A flex i disc featuring 'Humphrey' and 'We are\nthe Frank & Walters' is available\nfrom Setanta Records, 123\nShakespeare Road, London SE24,\nby sending your name and address,\nand two first class stamps.\n'Waaaaar th aaa are Fraaaaank a a an Waaaaaaters', which my\nexperienced ear translates into an\nintroduction. They add other such\nincomprehensible babble\nthroughout the set. They proceed at\nan all but leisurely pace through\n'Daisy Chain', 'The World Carries\nOn' and 'Walters Trip' before\nending with 'Never Ending\nStaircase.' Frank And Walters are\nsomething special. Can Thousand\nYard Stare follow this?\nErr. Not really. As they take the\nstage, and run through the opening\nchords of 'Junketing', a girl behind\nme says 'This is it, yeah?' That's the problem with being so close to\nEssex, I guess. Thousand Yard\nStare run through their album in a pretty workmanlike manner,\nsprinkled with extracts from their\nearlier EPs not included on the\nalbum, flavoured with the odd\ncomment such as 's ssh h, you're\nspoiling the vibe', and wrapped up\nin 'Wideshire.' They return for two\nencores, the first containing\n'Comeuppance' and 'Buttermouth',\nand second something else. But the\nFranA' and Walters blew them away.\nAnd most of the previously\nunaffiliated crowd agreed with me.\n(Survey results from a poll of 1\nperson, margin of error +-50%)\nLise Yates\n\u2022 The album 'Hands On' is out\nnow. and was reviewed in last\nweek's Felix.\nFrank, Walter and Walter\na sixties hangover as it were. Their\nsongs contain lyrics such as 'When\nRosemary falls, she falls in my\ngarden.' I detected a distinct hint in\nsome of their songs for a yearning\nto be Eric Clapton, and the\noccasional lapses towards those\nperennial Felix darlings. Airhead.\nNot bad really. Not as bad as\nAirhead, anyway.\nTrash, on the other hand, are\nquite sure who they want to be.\nThey are certain, sure, positive,\ninflexible even, in their desire to be\nJesus Jones. The difference between\nthis and what their predecessors\ndesire, is that Jesus Jones have only\never influenced one other band\n(EMF), and that Trash managed to\nkeep me awake. Not really too\nmuch to ask, is it?\nThere was another band, but they\nwere reduced to dust by their\nsupport. Trash are worth seeing.\nLise Yates\nSpinal Tap\n- Bitch School\nThis is Spinal Tap\nThis must go down as the most\nsuccessful piece of press in history.\nIt is absolutely amazing, after their\nprevious twelve albums (so they tell\nus) this single is released a couple\nof weeks before the new 33 entitled\nBreak like the Wind', oh what\nlovely people. This may seem\namazing but that is nothing\ncompared to my reaction upon\nlistening to this piece of vinyl\nhistory, I actually quite liked it! It\nmay not be the most open-minded\nsong around, you probably\nwouldn't have guessed that from the\ntitle, but they can actually play.\nDespite the loss of a drummer when\nhe spontaneously com busted in\nJapan, an a keyboard player that\nmet an equally fiery end the band\nlumbers on. One question remains,\nis this Spinal Tap?\nPebbles\nm Spinal Tap's new album, 'Break\nlike the Wind' is due out in\napprox im at ly three weeks.\n\u2014 1 9 \u2014\n\n"

BIKES ALREADY DISCOUNTED.\nDear Adam,\nIt is now 4 o 'clock on Saturday\nmorning February 29, 1992 and we\nhave just finished clearing up after\none of the most successful\nInternational Nights ever.\nMuch to our surprise, tickets for\nthe event were sold out a day before\nand yet we had a great number of\npeople queuing to get in on the\nnight. This in itself is quite an\nachievement, particularly when you\nconsider that a mere team of about\ntwenty people were minding the\nevent and over 1100 tickets were\nsold.\nThe night began with the\ntraditional food fair in the Main\nDining Hall where numerous\noverseas societies within the college\nwere given the opportunity to\npresent their culinary skills.\nAlthough the attendance was so\nhigh, over 1900 portions of food\nwere consumed and there was\nadequate supply for everyone who\nmanaged to find a ticket. I am\nparticularly grateful to the vice-chairman of the OSC, Gil Barzilay\nand the two other co-or dina tors of\nthe fair, Yen Yang Lim and Rupa\nPatel for their hard work and time\nwhich they put in.\nFrom the food fair, the crowds\nwere drawn into the Great Hall for\nthe Cultural Show. Here, a number\nof the societies sought to display\ntheir culture by way of dances,\nplays, songs and musical interludes.\nThe Hall itself was full almost\ninstantaneously and those who\ncould not obtain tickets were\nallowed to sweat out their tears in\nthe disco which was started\nsimultaneously in the JCR. With\nover 100 people involved in the\nshow it would be impossible to\nthank each one individually. I owe\nthanks to all of them for their\npatience and co-operation during all\nrehearsals and, of course, the\nperformance itself. Without their\ndedication the show would never\nhave been such a success.\nSpecial thanks must go to the\norganisers, Geetha Ratnasingham\nand Nee Phua, the technical\nmanagement of Chin, Esther and\ntheir crew and the hard working\nstage crew co-ordinated by Anjali\nSaini. I must also mention the\nIndonesian society whose\ncommitment towards the show was\nunbelievable.\nThe event concluded with the\nsounds and beats of 'KARIBA'\n(spelling?), one of the most lively\nafrican bands I have experienced\n(thanks Stephane) and the\ncontinuation of the excellent disco\nprovided by IC radio in the JCR.\nAdam, it is times like these that\nI really am proud of being part of\nsuch a committee. The massive\neffort produced by each one of the\nmembers over the past weeks has\nbeen astounding and the amount of\nwork put in by each national society\nwhich took part was fantastic.\nHowever, there are (as usual) a few matters of concern:\nFirstly, I found it extremely\ndiscouraging and annoying to\ndiscover only a few days before the\nevent that the union had suddenly\ndecided to hold a disco on the same\nnight. Sadly, even a low entry fee\nof 70p was not enough to affect our\nticket sales although I am sure this\nwas not intended.\nSecondly, I still fail to understand\nwhy so few 'home' students take\ninterest in the events which we\norganise. A majority of ticket\nholders were overseas students\nfrom all over London and I personally find it that the 'home'\nstudent population of this college\ntakes such minute interest in our\nactivities.\nAlthough I hope this will change\nin the future, none of the new\nsabbatical candidates seems to have\nmentioned Overseas students in\ntheir manifestos.\nAside from these worries, I would once again like to thank all\nthose who did attend this event and\nall those who participated and\nhelped make it such a huge success.\nI, particularly, enjoyed organising\nInternational Night '92 and I encourage all those who wish to\nhelp next year to join the Overseas\nStudents Committee in the\nforthcoming elections.\nYours sincerely,\nGaurang Chadha,\nOSC Chair 1991-92\nSurvey Supplement\nTerry Neville\nDirector of Finance.\nI am responsible to the Managing\nDirector for the management of the\nCollege's budget of \u00a3135m.I have spent the last 23 years in\nUniversity financial administration\njoining Imperial in 1984 as Chief\nAccountant, becoming Finance\nOfficer in 1986.

And later, smiling like\na martyr at the nurse at the Health\nCentre while she ladled vaccines\ninto my upper arm, it was obvious\nto me that my physical and mental\nresources would be taken to the\nedge. Pain, hard h sip, deprivation,\nand missing Brookside, I was\nprepared for all that. I was ready to\nrestrained, but suddenly we had\nfound ourselves in the thick of it (no\nnot that), with wild (and I mean\nfurious) chimpanzees charging\nabout the forest canopy above our\nheads, shaking branches and\nwhooping and screaming like' they\nwere holding an acid house party.\nActually most of the chimps\ncouldn't seem to make up their\nminds whether they wanted to be\nangry, to be frightened, or just to\neat the fruit. Either way, it seems\nthey defecate abundantly through all\nthree of these states, so all was well\nThird World\nFrontier Projects\nEver wanted to\ncollect\nchimpanzee\ndung?

No one even\nhinted that I would have a good time\nas well. That's what really broke\nme.'\nMelissa\nTanzanian Coastal Forest\nProject\nThe Frontier expeditions have been\nrunning in East Africa for almost\nthree years now, and the Society for\nEnvironmental Exploration, which\nco-ordinates the expeditions, is\nconstantly recruiting young people\nwho have a taste for adventure, an\nability to raise sponsorship and who\nwon't get lost on the London\nUnderground. Living conditions in\nfield camps are rough and makeshift\nand expeditions demand versatility,\ntolerance, enthusiasm and initiative.\nThese qualities tend to serve better\nthan academic qualifications when\nit comes to mano ever inga four-ton\ntruck out of a ditch.\nAll expedition work is directed in\nthe long-term towards the\nconservation and protection of\nnatural habitats such as tropical\nforests, coral reefs and mangrove\nestuaries. Projects are developed in\npartnership with the relevant\nwildlife author ites and research\ninstitutions of the host country to\nensure that the most urgent national\nconservation priorities are\naddressed. In order to be effective,\nthe projects are set up on a long-term basis. Nonetheless, each\nexpeditionary group has its own\nassigned objectives. Within that\ncontext there is an unending variety\nof tasks.\n'Chimpanzee dung they said they\nwanted. Nobody, it seems, gets\nmore excited about animal crap and\nzoologists. As a geography students\nmy own enthusiasm was more\nfor the job in hand. I sneaked a look\nover the huge buttress roots that\nsheltered me and saw Simon\ncrouched in the leaf litter frantically\nconsuming leaves from a nearby\nshrub. Strange behaviour you might\nthink for a civil engineer from\nPortsmouth, but in fact a gesture\ngreatly respected by irate\nchimpanzees. Certainly the dung\nsamples were going to be difficult.\nOn the one hand, here was a prime\nopportunity to get some fresh\nsamples, but on the other hand if\none of us moved, the chimps, some\nof which were right over our heads,\nshrieked louder than ever. What\ncould we do? Where could we get\nsome shit? Just then I reached\nbehind me for my rucksack, but\ninstead of canvass my fingers met\nsomething warm and yielding and\nas they did so I was suddenly aware\nof a violently rich and fruity aroma.\nI spun around, and there on the lid\nof my rucksack were three generous\nsplashes of something that looked\nlike peanut butter left out in hot sun.\nBy some miraculous stroke of\nfortune, one of the chimpanzees had\nactually dumped right on my bag,\nright by my side. Incredible luck.\nWe needed dung samples, and\nthey'd fallen right into our lap. And\nsome people wonder if God is good.\nDoes a bear shit in the woods?'\nJonathan\nKibale Forect Project\nThe aim of the Frontier Project in\nKibale Forest in western Uganda is\nto establish, in conjunction with the\nUganda Forest Department and\nMakerere University, a tourist and\neducation centre on the edge of the\nforest. Tourists who will visit the\nforest to see the chi manze es and\nwalk the trails, will generate\nvaluable foreign currency that is\nessential to the long-term survival\nof the Forest Reserve. Amongst a variety of other work, Frontier\nvolunteers have been collecting\ndung samples from the chimpanzees\non behalf of Makerere University\nField Station who supervise\nbehavioural research in another part\nof the forest. The samples are sent\nto Harvard University to test the\nhypothesis that the density of\nnematode worms in the dung is an\nindicator of how much stress an\nindividual chimpanzee is suffering.\nIf this is the case, the work will\nprovide invaluable baseline data\nagainst which to monitor, in the\nfuture, the disturbing effects on the\nchimpanzees caused by the\nintroduction of tourists into the\nforest. The level of tourist activity\ncan then be regulated accordingly\nand disturbance to the wildlife kept\nto a minimum. Frontier's work at\nKibale began in July 1991 and is\nexpected to last for at least two\nyears.\nOther Frontier projects in Uganda\nand Tanzania are involved in\nsimilar kinds of conservation\nactivity. These include the\nestablishment of Tanzania's first\nMarine National Park around Mafia\nIsland, and compiling species\ninventories for Tanzania's coastal\nforests. Work varies broadly from\ndigging latrines and counting\nmillipedes to map drawing and\ndiving on some of the most pristine\ncoral reef in the Western Indian\nOcea. It is also likely that projects\nin other parts of the world will be\ninitiated over the coming year.

The Conference and\nAccomodation Office sent letters to\nall students with 34 week leases\ninforming them that they faced\neviction at the start of the Easter\nvacation. Prince's Gardens students\nwho wished to remain in their\nrooms over the holidays were\nsubsequently informed that they\nwould either be billed at \u00a318 a night, or would be moved to other\ncollege ac como dati on. The fury provoked by this\narrogant missive resulted in a letter\nfrom the Overseas Students\nCommittee, again to Gordon\nMarshall. Making the point that\noverseas students would be\nespecially inconvenienced by\nevictions, they rapidly switched\nfrom persuasion to threat.\nWe have never in the past been\nreluctant to recommend Imperial to\nfellow students from our home\ncountries... however, if students are\nnot allowed to stay in their rooms\nover the Easter vacation, at the\nsame levels of rent that they\ncurrently pay, we will have to write\nto all Universities and funding\nbodies in our countries, to highlight\nthis lack of consideration.\nThe 'Easter business rates' plans\ncame on top of the continuing battle\nin Linstead over the food pricing\nsystem. During the 1991 summer\nvacation, in the absence of students,\nit was decided that Linstead Hall\nstudents would be charged for five\nevening meals a week, regardless\nof whether they were there or not.\nThis contrasted with the\narrangement in previous years\nwhereby students could sign out for\nup to two meals a week.\nThe advantage of the previous\narrangement was that it allowed\nstudents the flexibility to pursue\ntheir involvement with clubs and\nsocieties. Liz Holmes, Linstead\nHall convenor, described the new\nregulations as 'unreasonable and\nunfair', and said that 'a few students\nare already considering moving\nout'. She also pointed out that the\nnew scheme resulted in the wastage\nof at least 2,000 meals in the first\nterm alone.\nInitial suggestions from Gordon\nMarshall were rejected by Linstead\nresidents. After much discussion, a modification of the old rebate\nsystem was introduced. Though an\nimprovement, students at Linstead\nare far from completely satisfied.\nThey join students at Southwell,\nwhich has a list of defects as long\nas your arm. Southside students\ncomplain about freezing cold\nrooms. The good news is that the\ncockroaches in Southside don't seem to mind the cold, though they\nare concerned about the lack of\nkitchen facilities.\nLack of heat is also a problem in\nSelkirk and Tizard Halls. Olave\nHall has no hot water. Montpelier\nstill has its postgraduates, but no\nheating or maintenance.\nClayponds, South Ealing, is the\nnewest hall, and it has the most\nappropriate name. Why bathe when\nyou can swim? The condensation\nproblem has been solved by Gordon\nMarshall suggesting that residents\nleave their windows open. The one\nsnag is that this invalidates the\ninsurance. Illiteracy, Gordon?\nThe shower doors in Clayponds\nleak, but this is not confined to\nEaling. The Evelyn Gardens\nshowers are also useless when you\nneed them, and hyper- efficient\nwhen you don't. The ceilings find\nthe law of gravity amusing; they\nkeep'falling down in mirth. One\nwonders when the laughter of\nfalling masonry will be followed by\nthe screams of a trapped student.\nThe minor problems can be\nsolved by students reporting defects\nas and when they occur. The\nprocedure is to report defects to the\nhousekeeper, who will then report\nto the residences managers. If there\nis no action after three weeks,\nstudents are entitled to check the\n'defects' book in 15 Prince's Gardens, and then report to area\nresidences manager Graham\nDaniels (phone 3553 or\n071-589-4051).\nStudents should also notify IC\nUnion of any problems, through\nNicky Fox, Housing Officer, or\nJonathan Griffiths, Union Deputy\nPresident. The Union is pursuing\naccommodation problems at high\nlevels in the college, and it is\nessential for them to have accurate\ninformation.\nIf you wish to do this yourself,\nyou can contact Gordon Marshall\non 3402, Angus Fraser on 3003 or\n6016, or Sir Eric Ash, IC Rector,\non 3000. Angus Fraser can also be\ncontacted outside of hours on 071.\n589 9779. Again, please notify the\nUnion of any correspondence.\nIt is also a good idea to let your\ndepartment know of any\naccommodation difficulties. The\nbest person to contact is your\npersonal tutor, senior tutor, or head\nof department. Alternatively, IC\ncollege tutors are David Goodgame\non 4549 or Julia Higgins on 8308.\nAcademic departments have\nbecome especially concerned about\nthe IC accommodation crisis. They\nare now beginning to view it as a serious threat to IC's academic\nreputation, as well as a serious\nsocial problem. Academics and IC\nUnion have acted jointly in the past\nto solve individual difficulties. With\nthe ICU sabbatical elections\ncurrently running, it may be time\nto consider renewed action by the\nUnion, and to demand firm\nsuggestions from sabbatical\ncandidates on how they would deal\nwith the problem.\nIt is also time to look afresh at the\nworkings of the Estates division,\nand at the man oe uv rings of the\nAccommodation and Conference\nOffice. Time to consider their\nagenda. Time to work out if they\nare interested in housing students,\nor running a business. Time to\nevaluate their competence and\noverall suitability for the jobs they\nhold.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCONSERVATIVE\nSOCIETY\nPRESENTS\nLOUD WADDINGTON\nLEADER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS\nTUESDAY 1 7 MARCH\n1 .OOpm\nMECH ENG 542\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
