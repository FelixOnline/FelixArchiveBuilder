A\nterrible place for that is in a Union toilet which\nhas a fat log floating in it. A distressing place to do\nsuch a thing is in a toilet not just near me, but the\nwhole of the felix team. Yes we heard you, now\nfuck off back to sci-fi... better still Delta Quadrant.\nVirgo\nThis week you start\nout on your summer\nplacement. You\u2019ve\nbeen looking forward\nto it for months, so the\nnight before you lash!\nYou meet a girl, hitting it off, however when you\ngo to kiss her you turn it to a light headbutt. How\nyou can possibly fathom that that\u2019s a good idea is\nbeyond me- you idiot. She turns out to be your\nboss and immediately fires you the next day. Sorry.\nGemini\nShit! Its 2am on Saturday morning and\nyou\u2019ve run dry of co-caine, and your usual\ndealer is on \u2018holiday\u2019 in Wormwood\nScrubs. You try to snort flour, but it makes\nyou sneeze. What to do? You start to scratch\nyourself, pleading for coke, literally tearing your\nown hair out. However, all is not lost- you shoot\nthe nearest hoodie- he\u2019s bound to have some.\nPisces\nThis week you apply\nfor a new passport as\nyou have had yours for\n10 years and it\u2019s about\nto expire. You fill out\nall the necessary forms\nand send off to the passport office, gleefully awaiting your shiny new passport. Then things start to\ngo wrong. First you\u2019ll get a letter through the post\nwith your old passport, then the coppers show up\nat your door and deport you back to Ireland.\nLeo\nRight. You with the\nflat who got burgled.\nKeep it to yourself. I\ndon\u2019t care less. Your\nconversation was as\npleasurable as having\na cactus shoved up your arse, i.e. not very.

Protest Organisers, Ossain Hynes and Daniel\nBurrows, lead the vibrant \u2018mob\u2019 to the\nFaculty building to hand in the petition\nwith over 900 names. The protest was\norganised in response to the announc-ment that a 60% cut is due to be made\nto the offering of the Humanities and\nLanguages teaching, losing four languages and all lower level qualifications in the remaining four.\nSecurity were out in force and the\nFaculty Building was immediately\nlocked down with noone being allowed\nto enter or leave. ICU President, Jenny\nMorgan, infiltrated the building with\nher nifty swipe card access and persuaded the guards to allow Burrows to\nenter and hand over his petition. Morgan told Live!: \u2018I practically had to beg\nfor him to be let in. They were worried\nwe were going to throw eggs or something.\u2019 Live! is sure the most violent\nand competitive act carried out by this\ngroup was choosing Kadhim Shubber\u2019s\nchant from a list of proposed battle\ncries on the facebook group.\nBurrows informed the crowds that\nhe would keep them informed through\nthe facebook group and later sent a\nmessage describing the event as a\n\u2018great success\u2019. Professor Charmain\nBrinson, Programme Director for Languages, expressed her gratitude to the\nstudents who took part in the protest\ntelling Live! that \u2018in a global university\nand a global society it is misguided\nto cut an international language like\nJapanese and Arabic completely. This\nseems an undue amount of cuts to be\nmade on one small group.\u2019 However\nshe remains hopeful that the protests\nwill help towards finding a more positive outcome.\nNeither Rector, Roy Anderson, nor\nany other member of staff from the\nFaculty building came out to speak to\nthe protestors but there was plenty of\ninterest from people staying behind\nthe safety of the Blue Glass. A cheeky\nwave from Morgan to the fourth floor\nindicated that at least one person from\nthe Rector\u2019s Suite had witnessed the\nprotest and the crowds disbanded,\nfeeling they had achieved as much as\nthey could for today.\nFind out the students reactions at\nlive.cgcu.net\nI\nt has been three weeks since an\nanonymous member of the Humanities staff secretly ushered an\ninternal Staff Consultation Paper\ninto our hands down in the felix\noffice. As I took the story to write up\nfor that week\u2019s issue, I was ignorant to\nthe potential uproar it has since caused.\nMomentum started gathering when\nat the same time of that felix issue\u2019s re-lease, I received an email, again from\nan ambiguous signatory from the Humanities staff. It told me of the impending cuts also. However, this email was\naddressed to seemingly everyone the\nHumanities Department had on their\ndatabase. A personally written email to\neach and every student that had taken\nup a language course in the last few\nyears would surely evoke, at the very\nleast, a sympathetic response to all the\nmembers of staff that will lose their\njobs due to these cuts.\nThe protest that occurred today,\nin my mind, would be the true testament to the will of Imperial\u2019s students.\nI\u2019m glad to say a really decent number\nturned up. It could have so easily fallen flat on its face, like the countless\nnumber of house parties I\u2019ve tried to\norganise via facebook.. There weren\u2019t\n1000 + people there, but definitely\nenough to make their well-delivered\nchant of \u201cRoy, Roy, you take our fees,\ngive us back our humanities\u201d audible\nfrom across campus.\nSo, at this stage of the proceedings,\nit is the Humanities staff and students\nversus the College uppers. The Humanities staff are primarily concerned\nwith the job losses their department\nwill see, and have firmly peddled the\n\u2018without languages, your employability\nwill be reduced\u2019 notion onto the mass\nof students. The students have seen\nDan Wan\nNews Editor\nThe damage\nis done\nsense, and responded.\nThe sad case is, I really don\u2019t think\nCollege will budge, considering the fact\nthey basically made their minds up in\nMay 2008. In all honestly, their \u201cstrategic aims\u201d idea makes sense. A degree\nshould compose of relevant but extensively covering modules, but I honestly\nthink languages can be a part of that.\nCollege need to learn that you cannot\ngive a lollipop to a baby and rip it out of\nits mouth once it is enjoying it.\nIf they claim the cuts are not financially driven, they need to provide new\nalternatives to replace the items being\ncut out of the programme. If the students just see cuts, they feel depriva-tion. Implementing cutbacks but filling\nthose gaps with something else may go\nsome way to ease some students\u2019 reaction to the alterations. Saying that, it\u2019s\ntoo late for that. The ball in bouncing\nin College\u2019s court, to make an official\nstatement on their own accord; either\nto announce that they are sticking\nwith their guns, or hopefully, listen to\nthe noise being made in the last three\nweeks and announced revised plans for\nthe Humanities programme.\nIf I was an upper member of staff\nwithin College, I would make sure that\nthe newly revised Humanities programme for next year is a result of a\nstudent-College compromise. Sir Roy\nAnderson said he wanted to bring Imperial into line with Oxford and Cambridge in terms of student satisfaction.\nThough even further damage has been\ndone to student satisfaction over this\ndebacle, it is imperative that he recovers some of this with a revision of the\ncutbacks. Otherwise, no matter how\n\u2018world class\u2019 our institution is academi-cally, we will fall further back on every\nother part of university life.\nPosters raising awareness about the\n20th anniversary of the Tiananmen\nSquare protests have been slashed by\ndisgruntled students whilst on display\nin the Sherfield building.\nThe exhibition, by the Imperial\nCollege Public Awareness and Social\nService Society (PASS), is currently\non display outside the Great Hall in an\nattempt to educate the student body\nabout the events of Tiananmen Square\nin 1989.\nThe vandalism was discovered on\nTuesday morning, less than 24 hours\nafter the exhibition started. Several\nposters were slashed with a sharp\nimplement, presumably to show displeasure at the choice of subject mat-ter, despite a specifically dedicated\nposterboard for students\u2019 views and\ncomments.\nKeith Hariman, the President-elect\nof PASS, told felix that the society had\nno political agenda and was simply trying to tell a story which has dominated\nmodern Chinese history.\nOne of the comments posted in\nMandarin said that the majority of\nnon-Chinese students passing by\nwould \u2018think that China really is that\nscary.\u2019 Another insisted that the members of PASS should be \u2018proud to be\nChinese,\u2019 and asked them not to \u2018destroy the vision of Chinese unity in the\npublic arena.\u2019\nOfficial Chinese policy since 1989\nhas been to cover up the events of \u20186-4\u2019,\na date the rest of the world associates\nwith the infamous Tiananmen Square\nmassacre.\nThursday the 4th of June marked the\n20th anniversary of the Chinese democracy movement protests for all but\nthose who are most affected by it. In an\nattempt to prevent people in mainland\nChina from hearing the story, access\nhas been blocked to the websites Twitter and Hotmail, as well as a number of\nblog hosts.\nExternal newspapers have also been\naffected, with some papers either\nblocked or interfered with in an attempt to prevent news from reaching\nthe Chinese people.\nThough the government\u2019s stance is\nunflinching, the mainland Chinese\nstudents at Imperial are expressing any\nof a number of distinct views. Keith\nHariman tells of many Chinese and\nforeign students thanking him for organising the display, believing that the\nworld deserves to be educated.\nThere are a few, he admits, that adhere to the hardline patriotic view that\nthe students were to be blamed for\nstirring up trouble and killing soldiers.\nIt is people like this, he supposes,who\nripped the giant crosses through the\nposters early last week.\nA view he has heard more often,\nhowever, comes from those Chinese\nstudents who are afraid of portraying\na view of China divided. Putting Chinese criticism of China in the public\ndomain, they claim, weakens the perceived solidarity among Chinese stu-dents. Another handwritten poster\nin Mandarin echoed this view, urging\nmembers of PASS to \u2018stop creating\ntroubles within the campus [...] Our\ncountry is prosperous, and we should\nbe proud of it. But if our country is hu-miliated, then so are we.\u2019\nKeith finds this \u2018love it or leave it\u2019 attitude hard to understand. \u2018The British\nhave condemned their slave trade,\u2019 he\npointed out, \u2018and the Australians apologised for massacring the Aborigines.\nWhy can\u2019t our great country face up to\nits history?\u2019\nThose Chinese students who strongly believe that the 1989 government\nwas right in its actions will be difficult\nfor PASS to win over, but those afraid\nof breaking Chinese solidarity can be\nreassured. The worry for many of them\nis that the rest of the student body will\nbe too quick to jump to anti-Chinese\nconclusions, without taking the time to\nget to know the issues.\nIn an attempt to prevent such apa-thy, the posters will be up for most\nof the coming week, and members of\nPASS are almost constantly present to\nanswer questions and provide translations of some of the Mandarin text appearing on the wall.\nImperial students show a mixed set of reactions as newly\nformed PASS society hold awareness week on the 1989\nTiananmen Square incident\nGilead Amit &\nAndrew Somerville\nAssociate Editors past and present\nSir Roy Anderson, Rector of Imperial\nCollege, has recently told the Evening\nStandard that he would like to see the\ntop UK universities privitasied, effectively creating the UK equivalent of\nthe US Ivy League. He told the Evening\nStandard that:\n\u201cIf you take the top five universities,\nthey have enormous potential to earn\nincome for Britain. How best to do\nthat? My own view would be to priva-tise them. You don\u2019t want to be subject\nto the mores of government funding or\nchanging educational structures.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that the Sir\nRoy has brought into question the capability of the British Government to\nmanage the British universities. In his\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor-in-Chief\ninterview with felix back in February\n(Issues 1,424 & 1,425), Sir Roy was already questioning the areas in which\nthe goverment spends their money\nand the lack of financial support the\nhigher education sector receives from\nthem. He told felix that: \u201cLet\u2019s just say\nthat there are three or four areas of\ngovernment expenditure where a lot of\nmoney could be saved.\u201d When probed a\nlittle further, it was found the automotive sector was one of the key areas of\ngovernment spending, but since then\nthe money going there had been cut.\nFollowing on from that, Sir Roy went\non to say that: \u201cWell there is a lot of\nspending in certain areas where it is\nnot immediately clear that it is what\nthe world needs at the current point in\ntime. What we need are some technological solutions to some really urgent\nproblems and that includes alternative\nsources of energy, and in the interim\nbefore those arrive, we need solutions\nto carbon absorption.\u201d\nSir Roy expressed similar thoughts to\nthe Evening Standard saying that in his\nopinion Higher Eduction is \u201ca product\nthat Britain does superbly\u201d while the\ngovernment spends too much time\nand effort supporting \u201cdying industries\nsuch as car manufacturing\u201d. Clearly Sir\nRoy is proud of what Imperial has to\noffer and believes that more should be\nspent on research and development.\nBack in February, he told felix that the\nUK government gives one of the smallest amounts to R&D out of the G8\ncountries, yet firmly believes that R&D\nis \u201ccrucial in developing sophisticated\nhigh-tech manufacturers and industries\u201d and that they are a solution to\nboth \u201csocio-economic and technology\nproblems.\u201d\nOne of the solutions that Imperial\nhas employed over the past few years\nhas been to bring in more and more\ninternational students who are willing to pay in the region of \u00a315,000 or\nso a year to get a degree from Imperial College. Currently UK students\npay around \u00a33,000 a year to study at\nImperial which has generated an imbalance between the cost of training\na UK student and what the government give which Sir Roy describes as\n\u201cproblematic\u201d.\nThis new move by Sir Anderson is\nseen as a method of solving the financial problem that currently exists, the\nquestion that is constantly hanging\nover the average student is: how much?\nCurrently, the view from a lot of Rectors and Vice-Chancellors is that the\ntutiton fee cap placed by the government is stiffling and that it needs to be\nchanged, with many of them calling for\nthe cap to be raised to \u00a36,500 a year.\nHowever, if the move was made to pri-vatise these universities, which also include Oxford, Cambridge, the London\nSchool of Economics and University\nCollege London, then there would be\nnothing stopping them increasing the\nfees for both home-grown and international students. As a response to the\npossible higher tuition fees, Sir Roy has\nindicated that there would be scholarships and bursaries set up to aid the\ngifted students.\nThis method of supporting the\nbright students is not a new one. Sir Richard Sykes mentioned a similar thing\nto the BBC back in 2002 where he told\nthem \u201cif, for example, the fee were set\nat \u00a310,500 ... then \u00a316.9m would be\ngenerated if 30% of students paid full\nfees and 70% received bursaries.\u201d It was\nan early indication that there stood the\npossibility of Imperial having a bursary\nscheme to aid the incredibly gifted stu-dent, something that the current Rector also seems to favour.\nA method for solving the financial\nproblem and the constant constraint\nby the British government has been in\nthe air for quite a few years. If a university chose to privatise, they would effectively solve both of these problems,\nhowever, what impact will this have on\nthe student body? Will the universities\nhave to make a compromise between\nthe quality of the students they admit\nand the those who have the money to\npay for the education? Where will the\nmoney initially come for the \u201cscholarship endowment\u201d that will \u201ccontinue to\ntake people from all walks of life\u201d as Sir\nRoy put it? Or, is this just a way of generating as much money as they possibly can from students who are already\nstruggling to cope with the financial\nconstraints?\nFinally, is this the only solution avail-able? If the government is standing\nfirmintly on having 50% of students\nbetween 18-23 in higher education,\nthen they will need more universities\nthat will spread the money available\nto them very thinly. If they are unwilling to change on this, then do the top-end universities have any other option\navailable to them? At the moment,\nthey certainly don\u2019t think they do.\nKirsty Patterson\nLive!

After my first race, the heat, I\nfinished 4th and I thought I was in for a\nshit weekend in Spain but I had a confidence boast duffing up some of the\nweaker competitors in the reperchage\nthat same afternoon and the next day\nI was on a mission to turn it around.\nHow did you feel once you had\nwon it?\nWell I am very chuffed to win my\nfirst senior international medal, it goes\nvery well in my otherwise empty trophy cabinet.\nDo you have aspirations for the\nOlympics in 2012 and do you plan\nto move up into the 4 man and 8\nman boats?\nOf course 2012 is the main aim, for\nme in the lightweight category there\nare six seats, a double and a four. Those\nbeing my options I need to move out of\nthe single at some point.\nMoving away from the rowing\nside of things, this is a question\nthat we have asked previous\nsports persons that we inter-viewed. Should sports clubs\nat IC aim for performance or\nparticipation?\nWell I think everyone should enjoy\nsport and not have to endure the pain\nof high-performance. I mean I love doing others sports as well and I generally\nsuck at most of those. However at IC,\ngiven that there has been such a history of rowing success and its ideal location and set up, it would be a pity to\nlet it go to waste.\nWho is your favourite\nsports-person\nIn rowing it would have to be Alan\nCampbell, he is the men\u2019s heavy weight\nsingle sculler (sorry Steve). I have been\na fan of his for a long time, he trains\nhard and parties even harder. At the\nWorld Cup Regatta I got to be room\nmates with him, probably the highlight\nof the weekend, eclipsing even the\nmedal wining moment.\nAt outside of rowing it would have\nto be Jenson Button - the man\u2019s on fire!\nIf you couldn\u2019t row at Imperial,\nwhat other sport would you do?\nTable football in the union bar\nAnyone you want to personally\nthank or add?\nI think a big thanks to Sport Imperial for developing the rowing at imperial and also providing me with a\nscholarship\nfelix Sport has a quick Q&A\nwith Adam Freeman-Pask\nAdam Freeman-Pask with his bronze medal from Spain\nPhoto by Peter Spurrier of Intersport Images\nPutting the cat out to dry\nhangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHangman\nHumanities protest turns violent\nA\nllegedly... What began as\na peaceful protest quickly got out of hand as\nangry students charged\ninto the Faculty Building\nslaughtering all inside before setting\nfire to the building. It is rumoured that\nseveral high-ranking officials managed\nto flee the massacre including Rector\nSir Roy Anderson and Pro-Rector Julia\nBuckingham (to put this into perspec-tive, our university is called Imperial,\nthe Pro-Rector is called Buckingham\nand her boss is a Sir... right.)\nThe students, led by the ruthless Ossian Hynes and Daniel Burrows (most\ncommonly known by the moniker \u2018The\nButcher\u2019), began the protest on the\nQueens Lawn before marching on The\nBlue Cube chanting \u201cRoy! Roy! You\ntook our fees! Now give us back our\nmanatees!\u201d\nThe \u2018so-called\u2019 manatees which provoked the protest are two 80 year Biology professors who went missing 3\n\u2022 Students set fire to the\nFaculty Building\n\u2022 Rector missing, presumed\nanxious and tired\nA\nllegedly... Out of the 20 or\nso positions up for grabs\nin recent Union elections (Ed: we\u2019re not sure\nwhat the exact number\nwas mainly because no one cares) only\n10 of the positions were filled, leaving\nplenty of CV filler left lying around\nunclaimed.\nThe candidates (people who have\nfinished exams and have nothing better\nweeks ago after using the old College\ncrest on official documentation.\nAfter a tense 5 minutes camped outside the Blue Cube, protestors became\nagitated and began throwing glass bottles and eggs at the building. The Rector himself came out to intercede with\nOssian and \u2018The Butcher\u2019. The con-versation, the content of which is un-known, seemingly aggravated the situation as Ossian appeared to knee the\nRector in the balls, sending him fleeing\nback into the building. Hangman\u2019s expert lip-reader has examined footage\nof the conversation but has only been\nable to interpret the phrases \u201cBloody\nCommunists\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m totally going to\nknee you in the balls\u201d.\nWith the College administration in\nruins and its leadership either dead or\nin hiding it remains to be seen what\ngovernment will emerge in the wake of\nthe events. It is rumoured that Mr Burrows is set to announce a new era of\nviolent geekdom later this week.\nAllegedly\nHangman Editor\nDon\u2019t mess with\nbiologists\nH\nistory is littered with\nthe corpses of dictatorial ambitions, foiled\nby seemingly innocuous errors or misjudge-ments. Perhaps if Hitler hadn\u2019t diverted the Luftwaffe from targeting RAF\nbases then the Battle of Britain might\nnot have ended in our favour. Perhaps\nif Napolean hadn\u2019t decided to march\ninto Russia then his empire may have\nbeen preserved. And if the Rector Sir\nRoy Anderson hadn\u2019t united teaching staff and students (his two greatest enemies) alike in opposition to the\ndisappearences of Henry Pritchdiddle and Simone Dinklefiddle, biology\nprofessors with expertise in the field\nof manatee research, then perhaps he\nwouldn\u2019t have got kicked in the balls\n(see above).\nUltimately there was no need for\nsuch heavy-handness so shortly after\ntaking power. 1 year into the job, Sir\nRoy had not yet managed to assert\nhimself and solidify his base.\nHis predecessor, Sir Richard \u2018Dicky\nDickbird\u2019 Sykes was certainly hated,\nbut he commanded such fear that he\ncould act with almost complete impu-nity. He delivered economic prosperity and as payment he took political\nfreedoms.\nSir Roy couldn\u2019t claim credit for Imperial\u2019s economic success and as an\noutsider needed to win over his administrative staff. To assert his authority I would have advised taking on the\nbiochemistry students. With no official departmental representation they\nare in a word, defenseless. Stamping\non the biochemistrical face would have\nellicited little protest from the rest of\nthe student body who for the most part\nlook on biochemists as pitiful sub-hu-mans. (Biochemistrical is not a word! -Ed) (Shutup! p.s. I fucked your mom\n- Hangman Ed).\nBut alas, Sir Roy mistakenly took on\nthe biologists and has paid the highest\nprice. Whether he will be found in the\nruins of the Blue Cube, having come to\nthe same end as Adolf Hitler or if he is\nin exile and destinied to the same fate\nas Napolean is as yet unknown.\nEither way, the old adage that history repeats itself has been proven.\nNext dictator on the hitlist.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 5 June 2009 felix\nArts\nTackling mental illness through art\nEmily Wilson goes to her favourite London museum, the Wellcome Collection, for two exhibitions that\noffer contrasting views of mental illnesses and how they can affect, and be affected by, the arts\nC\nurrently Wellcome are\ndisplaying two exhibitions side-by-side on\nmental illness. This is a\ntough topic to take on,\nand the two exhibitions do so in polar\nopposite ways and to quite different\nlevels of success.\nMadness & Modernity focuses on\nthe interplay of art and mental illness\nin Vienna around 1900. This struck\nme as a weirdly narrow scope for a\nmajor exhibition, reading like the title\nof an obscure PhD thesis. It includes\nthe architecture of sanatoria, artists\u2019 interpretations of the mentally\nill and art produced by the mentally\nill themselves. The exhibition space\nis smoothly designed, arranged with\nthought, logic and precision. The use\nof architectural shape and design is\na consistent underlying theme. The\nlayout and structure was so elegant it\nwas almost art in itself. As always, the\nexhibition space and indeed the whole\nof the Wellcome Collection had some\npretty vicious air conditioning. This is\npleasant when you arrive out of the hot\nsummer sun, following a sticky tube\njourney, but less nice an hour or two\ninto your visit and you\u2019re shivering. I\nsuppose it does add to the atmosphere\nof this particular exhibition.\nIt kicks off with a film walking us\naround Narrenturm, a Viennese sanatorium known as the \u2018Tower of Fools\u2019\nand now a museum. This is a wonderful start to the exhibition, taking you\nround and round the circular corridors\nin a way that tricks the mind. Its ambient clunking and breathy whir can\nbe heard across the gallery, keeping it\nvery slightly sinister.\nFans of Sigmund Freud may find\nMadness & Modernity worth a look.\nThat\u2019s the era of psychiatry we\u2019re talking about, and his name gets banded\nabout throughout. There are some odd\nlittle objects from his study on loan\nfrom his London museum. They\u2019re\nquirky and pleasant to look at, though\nI don\u2019t entirely see their relevance.\nThe exhibition as a whole isn\u2019t as\nsickening or disturbing as I had ex-pected, though the electrotherapeutic\ncage raises a shudder, as do some photos of patients with physical deformities taken by Jean-Martin Charcot. The\nfinal section on \u2018The Patient Artist\u2019 is\nan uplifting highlight containing the\ncharming drawings and scribblings of\nJosef Karl Radler, confined to a private\nViennese asylum. Ornate and fasci-nating, they have intricate details and\nsad faces in ink line and crisply used\nwatercolour.\nIt\u2019s difficult to draw a verdict on this\nexhibition. It\u2019s well put together and\ninformative but I don\u2019t really see the\npoint of it. It doesn\u2019t tackle any issues\nor offer a substantial enlightenment. It\nselects a period of cultural and social\nhistory and picks out a few relevant artifacts without offering an underlying\ntheme or take-home message. It\u2019s nice\nto look round but wouldn\u2019t be worth\ntravelling to see in its own right.\nWhat makes your trip worthwhile is\nBobby Baker, performance artist and\nmental health patient, and her incredible drawings. This delight leaves the\nmore traditional Madness & Modernity display of fact and artifact in the\ndust with its bright, light and funky\njourney through Baker\u2019s dealings with\nthe mental health system.\nThis exhibition of her doodled diary\nboth acts as an in-depth commentary\non the modern experience of mental\nillness and the failings of the health\nThis is a model of Narrenturm, a big spooky mental hospital in Vienna, now a museum. We like museums! One of a series of crazy grimacing heads in Madness & Modernity\ncare system on offer, and as a lighthearted jaunt on the funny side of going crazy. It\u2019s astounding how tender\nbut in-your-face Baker is about her\nexperiences. Interwoven are her fam-ily, work, daily routines, chats with her\ntherapists and her days of darkness,\nself-harm and hallucination. Tears\ncome to my eyes several times, notably when a finally recovering Bobby is\ndiagnosed with breast cancer. However, smiles and giggles appeared much\nmore often.\nI am a big fan of doodles and the doodlers who produce them, and I get excited when they pop up amongst more\nhighbrow art. And here a whole gallery\nof doodles being displayed as the fascinating insight into the human psyche\nthat they are was an utter delight. This\nis a perfect way to tackle mental health\nissues as well as entertaining and fascinating viewers. I strongly urge all to\ndrop into the Wellcome and see this.\nIt is, after all, completely free to do so.\nGo for Bobby, but walk round Madness & Modernity on your way.\nMadness & Modernity\nUntil 28 June\nBobby Baker\u2019s Diary Drawings\nUntil 2 August\nA sample of the wonderful doodlings of the fabulous Bobby Baker. There\u2019s a whole room full of these!\nR\ned is recognised as a highly\nsymbolic colour. In terms\nof emotions, it can represent the hue of passion,\nspirit and anger. Countries\nuse red as national symbols: Japan has\nthe red sun, Poland the red earth and\nRussia had the red star.\nAs part of the recent re-hang at the\nTate Modern, under the display theme\n\u2018States of Flux\u2019 was a room titled \u2018Red\nStar Over Russia\u2019. Here, eighty-five\npropaganda posters are on display,\nflooding the room with an electric\nhumming of red, ornamenting the\npowerful subject matter. Red is also, as\nwe well know, the colour of blood.\nThe history of these posters begins\nwith the end of the First World War\nand the collapse of the once powerful and immensely rich tsarist regime.\nThe October Revolution in 1917 was\ndescribed by John Reed, an American\njournalist, as the \u201cten days that shook\nthe world\u201d. During those days, the Bolsheviks seized power and Vladimir\nLenin began to mould Russia into Karl\nMarx\u2019s socialist design of a unified,\n\u2018communised\u2019 state.\nTo generate public support, the\nprinting presses were seized during\nthe revolt and a river of newspapers,\nleaflets and posters made their way\nthrough the cities and towns \u2013 reaching out to the common man and woman with their bright colour and bold\nmessages.\nThe Soviet poster has its own pictorial history and recognisable themes,\nfrom the repetitious duplication of\nphotographs of Lenin, to the grotesque\ndepiction of capitalists as fat cats and\ngreedy golems \u2013 these posters embodied the art of propaganda in a rich visual way. The posters on display in the\nTate Modern vary in examples of pho-tography, architectural display, caricature and the abstract \u2013 sometimes an\namalgamation of all those things. The\ncolour varies also, mostly alongside\nmonochrome \u2013 yellow, blue, green and\nabove all, red.\nOne of the most striking was designed by Iosif Gerasimovich for \u2018The\nMullah\u2019s Third wife\u2019, a silent film made\nin 1928. The poster depicts a beautiful\nsiren, of an illustrated style very similar\nto the film posters of 1920s America.\nThe woman\u2019s dress however, consists\nof a structure of bold, colourful lines \u2013\nsuggestive of a garment, yet contrived\nfiguratively, implying an illusion.\nThe story of the film, following the\nmisadventure of a young woman in a\nman\u2019s world was meant as a criticism\nof the lack of freedom for women in\nthe East.\nSadly, the same was true of Soviet\nRussia, even though those in power\nseemed unaware of this. The Soviet\nwoman was granted the \u2018freedom\u2019 to\nwork alongside Soviet man, yet the\ninequality arose when man, coming\nhome from work demanded to be fed\nand cared for, refusing to aid in other\nchores such as cleaning the house and\ncaring for children and the elderly.\nThese the Soviet woman had to man-age, without complaint, because of this\ngift of \u2018freedom\u2019 that a life of communism had blessed her with. We can see\nthe Soviet woman worker in posters of\nthe era \u2013 sometimes triumphant, her\nfist punching the sky in victory, sometimes bordering on the sexual \u2013 mouth\nparted, collar open \u2013 certainly an attractive image to both men and women\nto aspire to.\nFinally, even more strangely \u2013 but\ncommon to Soviet ideals \u2013 as an androgynous sort of non-man, non-woman \u2013 simply a Soviet \u2018comrade\u2019, focused on the ideal of the greater good.\nThe \u2018socialist experiment\u2019, as it was\nknown, was just that \u2013 a theory forced\ninto reality by a group of radicals who\nwanted the best for their people, but\nalso who appeared to miss a fundamental step in the social evolution, as\nfundamentally laid down by Marx in\nhis \u2018Communist Manifesto\u2019. This being\nthe fact that communism should be the\nnext logical step after capitalism from\nfeudalism. Russia had been largely feu-dal, with serfs serving their lords (and\nthe tsar owning everything). What was\nto become the USSR \u2013 a huge expanse\nof Asia and Europe swallowed up by\n\u2018Matushka-Rus\u2019 \u2013 was far from being\ncapitalist. Some of these areas, such\nas the more remote places of Siberia\nor even closer to home in Romania,\nare still struggling in the aftermath of\ncommunism from being cajoled into a\nsocialist regime. A typical communist\nattitude was for \u20182+2=5\u2019.\nOne poster from 1931 explains this:\n\u201cFulfill the Five-Year Industrial-Financial Plan in Four Years\u201d, typically hurrying physical progress without really\nconsidering mental growth. Wisdom\nof this kind led to expansive visions\nof futuristic cities and Vladimir Tatlin\nis one of the most recognised utopian\nconstructivists. Edifices such as his\n\u2018Monument to the Third International\u2019\nare well-recognised in the visual history of Soviet Russia, even though its\nconstruction never came to fruition\n(like many other towering visions,\nthe basic needs of the people over-took). The aim seemed to be to reach\nfor the stars, to outdo every other developed society with technology and\nman-power. Historian Boris Groys attributes this egotistical, phallocentric\nthinking to a historical national paranoia of inferiority. Whether or not this\npsychosis still remains is something to\ncontemplate.\nIt seems easy in retrospect to reflect\nupon the nature of communism as inherently flawed, but the truth is, those\nborn into communism yearn now for\nthe time when they felt secure in the\nknowledge that someone was watching\nover them at all times (readers familiar with Orwell would shudder at the\nthought). Perhaps there is some sense\nin this sentiment however, in an age\nand so-called civilised society where\nbabies are snatched from their beds\nand we fear teenagers more than any\nother.\nAt least in communist Russia they\nhad goals to work for and a neighbour\nto watch their back.\nRosie Milton goes to see the \u2018Red Star\nOver Russia\u2019, temporary room in the Tate\nModern\nA bright red\nstar over the\nUSSR\n\u201cPeople and the army united\u201d\nImperial students UNESCO artwork exhibited in Portugal\nNext week:\n\n"

Today, imaging technologies allow us to observe the structures of the live brain in incredible\ndetail, and link its activity to thoughts,\nfeelings, and actions. This has already\nchanged how we think about ourselves,\nas newspapers report the discovery of\nareas of the brain apparently responsible for everything from optimism to\nreligious belief.\nThis scenario is exciting, but raises\nserious questions about how we want\nto use and regulate these technologies.\nOn the one hand, our ability to diagnose and treat mental illness and brain\ndamage should improve beyond recog-nition. On the other, the use of brain\nscans in interrogation, or to predict future criminality from a particular pattern of brain activity, is troubling and\nfar from unimaginable. Indeed, a commercial company in the US has already\ntried to bring fMRI \u2018lie-detection\u2019 evidence to court, despite concerns from\nscientists about its reliability.\nThese were the kinds of issues that\nLouise Whiteley and I wanted to bring\nto a wider audience. We agreed that\nthe question of exactly when and how\nwe ought to look inside people\u2019s minds\nis one that we should discuss as a soci-ety. And we decided that the best way\nto do it was through radio drama, creating a series of short narratives that\ntranslated these abstract philosophical\nquestions into concrete scenarios that\npeople could relate to.\nThe stories that we chose to focus on\ninvolve two characters, a middle-aged\nwoman who develops a brain tumour\nthat causes changes in her personal-ity, and a young man with psychopathy who comes into conflict with the\nlaw. By imagining the experiences they\nmight have had in 1906, the present\nday, and in 2030, we were able to explore how our society is changing in\nits ability to understand and cure brain\ndisease, but also in its attitudes to\ncriminality and madness. And projecting into the future, we were able to imagine some of the advantages, but also\nsome of the worrying possibilities, that\nthe brain science of tomorrow might\nbring.\nInterior Traces is being broadcast on\nResonance 104.4fm, with two shows\nstill to go on the 5th and 12th of June\nat 3.30pm. We\u2019re also going to be at the\nSecret Garden Party Festival from the\n23rd \u2013 26th of July. Visit our website,\nwww.interiortraces.com, to find out\nmore and join in the discussion.\nLouise Whiteley is a student on Imperial\u2019s Science Communication MSc\ncourse, and James Wilkes is a PhD student at the London Consortium.\nActors Anna Turnland, Nick Romero, and Michael Roberts perform Episode 2 of Interior Traces at the\nWellcome Collection on the 7th of May, 2009. Episode 2 is set in 1906, and follows a psychopath called\nMick, and his encounter with an asylum doctor who is convinced that he is \u2018criminally insane\u2019.\nMusic helps stroke victims\u2019 visual awareness\nOlivia Sharp\nScience Correspondent\nMusic stirs the emotions, inducing a\nkaleidoscope of feelings in a person,\nbe it blissful reverence from a Handel\nMass, or subdued melancholy from\none of The Smiths\u2019 odes to the futility\nof existence.\nThe profound effect of music is commonly agreed, but what if you were\ntold the emotions music induces can\nimprove the way your brain functions?\nNeuroscientists from Imperial College\nand the University of Birmingham are\nlooking into this phenomenon, studying the effect of pleasant music on\npatients who have lost part of their\nvisual awareness through brain damage caused by stroke.\nImpaired visual awareness or \u2018neglect\u2019 affects as many as 60% of people who suffer a stroke to the periortal\ncortex on the right side of their brain.\nIt causes patients to neglect the left\nhand side of their visual field. In extreme cases, sufferers might dress half\nof their bodies, and eat only the food\non the right side of the plate.\nPrevious studies have shown a positive attitude can improve the efficiency\nof cognitive processing; the research\nteam used this as inspiration to see\nif positive emotions caused by music\nmight help stroke patients improve\ntheir visual neglect. Three stroke patients who suffer from chronic visual\nneglect took part in the study, and were\nasked to pick some of their favourite\nmusic. A popular choice was country and western singer Kenny Rogers,\nwho has since publicised the research\non his website. The patients\u2019 visual\nawareness was tested by asking them\nto press a button when they could see\na red light appear. All participants saw\nan improvement when they heard a favourite tune. One patient noticed the\nlight in 65% of the cases when his favourite music was played; compared to\njust 15% when there was no music or\nmusic he did not like.\nSo what is happening in the brain\nwhen a good feeling seems to make the\nvisual neglect much better?\nDr Pia Rotshtein from the University\nof Birmingham was a researcher on the\nstudy, and admits they are not entirely\nsure of the connection - \u201cthere is a the-ory, but this is really handwaving.\u201d She\nexplains, \u201cVisual neglect is an atten-tional problem, its not that they don\u2019t\nhave the visual information, it\u2019s just\nthat it doesn\u2019t reach their conscious-ness. There is a metaphor that says visual attention is like a spotlight. You can\nmove the spotlight in the environment,\nyou can light specific objects and see\nthem much clearer. You can tend to a\nvery local area in your visual field, or\nyou can attend, like, broadly.\u201d\n\u2018The theory suggests that if you are in\na positive mood, your visual attention\nis broader, you attend to a larger envi-ronment. So we thought to ourselves\nthis is a possible explanation.\u2019\nUsing MRI scans to monitor brain\nfunction the team also found pleasant\nmusic stimulated the frontal region of\nthe brain, responsible for emotion and\ndecision making, to help the region of\nthe brain affected by stroke.\nAs Rotshtein puts it, \u2018once you\u2019re in a\ngood mood, you have the frontal cortex being recruited to help the perior-tal cortex, to kind of kick it and get it\ngoing.\u2019\nWhen asked if they are recommending the treatment to doctors, Rotshtein\nreplies, \u2018I think music is generally good\nfor everyone right? You don\u2019t need science for that!\u2019\nNew incentives\nto encourage\nchlamydia testing\n\u201cDo you fancy a free drink?\u201d Why of\ncourse I do. Why else would I have\njust walked into the Union Bar. \u201cWell,\nyou\u2019ll have to take this test first.\u201d Ok,\nbut why do I need a plastic pot in order\nto take a test. \u201cIt\u2019s a Chlamydia test.\u201d\nOh right, I see.\nThe NHS in West London\u2019s Chlamydia screening programme is targeting\n15-24 year olds. One in 10 of which,\nwhen tested, are infected with the dis-ease. Over the last month it stepped\nup a gear with the MAYbe advertising\ncampaign and celebrity endorsements.\nYou can even get a \u00a310 HMV voucher\nin return for a home testing kit. Just go\nto https://www.check-kit.org.uk/.\nIt might seem like Chlamydia is just\na public health issue. We know how it\nworks, how to treat it and now we just\nneed to stop it spreading. But this week\na group of UK scientists published research showing how these bacteria can\nstill surprise us.\nIn Sweden in 2006, a new variant of\nChlamydia appeared: one that was invisible to the tests used at the time. The\nnew study reveals why this happens.\nA single bacterium grew without\npart of the DNA code normally found\nin the plasmid \u2013 floating DNA not part\nof the bacteria\u2019s chromosomes. This\nbit of code was exactly what Swedish\nlabs used to test whether an infection\nis Chlamydia or not.\n\u201cIt turns out that this piece of the\nDNA is not essential to the Chlamydia. Therefore, an accidental deletion\nof the DNA won\u2019t kill the bacterium,\nbut it will stop it being identified,\u201d explained Helena Seth-Smith, from the\nWellcome Trust Sange Institute.\nShe said that they had never seen\nthis kind of mutation before. Most cell\nmutations occur because of interaction between bacteria. But Chlamydia\ngrows inside human cells. And so, bacteria have little chance to interact with\none and other.\nThe new type of mutation is a warning for tests on other bacterial infec-tions. If the bacterium of another\ndisease undergoes a similar test, \u201cit\u2019s\npossible that another chance deletion\ncould make that bacterium invisible.\u201d\nThe researchers also identified what\nthey think are the essential parts of the\nChlamydia DNA. These make more\nreliable targets for diagnostic tests because if they mutate the bacterium is\nunlikely to survive anyway. Seth-Smith\nis hopeful that future tests will be better designed as a result.\nThis new research shows just how\nmuch we can still learn about diseases\nwe thought we already understood.\nAnd it shows how useful these lessons\ncan be for keeping the diseases under\ncontrol.\nOf course, public awareness drives\nare necessary. And maybe screening\ncampaigns will help London lose its\nlabel as the UK\u2019s \u2018Chlamydia capital\u2019.\nBut the lesson from this study, is that\nChlamydia is not just a public health\nissue. Good public health policy still\nneeds to be backed up by good, detailed genetic research.\nChlamydia close up: a bacterial\ninfection which is usually passed\non during sex, it is the most\ncommon STI with up to 70%\nof those infected having no\nsymptoms.\nModel predicts juvenile\nraven behaviour\nGangs of teenagers roaming the land\nare generally bad news, but not when it\ncomes to ravens. Juvenile ravens hunting in packs have gotten some scientists very excited, as this behaviour was\npredicted by a mathematical model before ever being seen in the wild.\nDr Sasha Dall lectures in mathematical ecology at the University of Exeter,\nand in 2002 set out to solve an evolutionary puzzle: why do young ravens\nshare their food? Natural selection tells\nus organisms should only help themselves and their relatives. It seems that\nno one told the ravens.\nTypically, juvenile ravens spend their\nwinters drifting in and out of communal\nroosts. They scavenge for food, usually\nsheep carcasses, by themselves. Having found a tasty meal they return to\nthe roost and recruit other ravens for a\nfeast the next day. These shared dwellings can house up to 100 individuals,\nbut they don\u2019t stick around. Each bird\nwill move on every few days to another\nroost and likely won\u2019t encounter their\nformer roommates again.\n\u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective,\nthis is a bit weird,\u201d says Dall. The ravens\nare unrelated so will not pass on their\ngenes by helping out others. They also\ndon\u2019t encounter the same individuals often enough to build up a sense of co-op-eration. Using a technique called game\ntheory, in which many different strategies are played out, Dall built a model to\nexplain this unusual behaviour.\nThe favoured hypothesis amongst\necologists was roosts act as a kind of\n\u201cinformation centre\u201d to the advantage\nof all the juveniles. Individual birds\nare unlikely to find a carcass by them-selves, but if every bird shares information about food locations then they all\nbenefit.\nDall\u2019s model showed that this strategy\nemerged naturally when ravens try to\nmaximise their access to food. \u201cIn the\nlong run, they find more carcasses than\nthey otherwise would,\u201d he says. Bringing\na few friends along also allows young\nbirds to chase off any adults who might\nlay claim to carcasses in their territory.\nProblem solved then - except the\nmodel didn\u2019t provide just one answer.\n\u201cI did manage to predict this typical\nbehaviour, but my model came up with\nanother evolutionary stable strategy,\u201d\nexplains Dall. According to the model,\ngangs of juvenile ravens should also fly\naround looking for food together, and\nnever roost in the same place twice.\nBut no-one had ever seen this kind of\nbehaviour.\nPerhaps this would have been dismissed as purely mathematical curi-Jacob Aaron\nJessica Bland\nMusicians Carla Rees and Oliver Coates\nThe scientists are thinking about calling the discovery \u2018The Kenny Rogers Effect\u2019\nosity, if weren\u2019t for Jonathan Wright,\nprofessor of biology at the Norwegian\nUniversity of Science and Technology. Wright was studying a large raven\nroost in North Wales when he noticed\nthat the juvenile birds were organising\nthemselves in to hunting packs, just as\nDall predicted.\n\u201cI was surprised to discover that this\nbehaviour had been observed somewhere,\u201d says Dall. The variables used in\nthe model, such as the size of the ravens\u2019\nsearch area, matched the real world ex-actly. The two scientists wrote up their\nfindings in a joint paper, published earlier this year in the journal PLoS One.\nSo what will Dall turn his mathematical predictions to next? \u201cThe evolution of animal personality differences,\u201d\nhe says. Dall plans to investigate why\nanimals of the same species behave differently within social groups. Perhaps\ngame theory has the answer.\nJust like students, juvenile ravens live communally\nThe Colours of Nature: Ed Sharp took this photo in Boracay,\nPhillipines. \u2018Boracay, the Philippines: Getting a tow from another boat\nthrough the strong currents provided the perfect photo opportunity\nwith the sunset in the background\u2019\n\n"

In the end our three riders were\nsplit into two teams: Andr\u00e9 and Trisna\ntogether, whilst Kathleen was put on a\n\u2018mixed team\u2019 with a French rider.\nAndr\u00e9 jumped a lovely clear round\nto put the ghosts of his BUCS Nationals show-jumping round behind him,\nbut sadly Trisna had problems with the\nmare she rode. Despite the horse being\ncalled Jumper, Trisna fell to the same\nfate as one of the French riders who\nrode the same horse, being thrown off\nand deposited onto the floor. Ever the\nbrave rider, Trisna clambered back on\n(twice!) and finished her round to prevent elimination.\nWith Andr\u00e9 and Trisna\u2019s chance of\nwinning now looking very slim it was\nall down to Kathleen who thankfully\nseemed to have luck on her side. After securing a perfect clear round and\nher teammate knocking only one fence\ndown, they finished in eventual first\nplace. Despite her French-Canadian\nnationality, Kathleen stood proudly on\nthe winner\u2019s podium to the British National Anthem, to receive her rosette.\nA fitting end to one of the riding club\u2019s\nmost successful seasons ever.\nInternational\nSuccess for IC\nRiding\nChlo\u00e9 Sharrocks\nat the World Cup Regatta will certainly increase in chances of selection\ninto the Great Britain squad for lightweights event this year, and there is a\nstrong chance that he might be selected for the Olympics in 2012.\nResponding to the success at the\nRegatta, Erica Thompson, Captain of\nICBC, told felix that \u201cWe are all very\nproud of Adam\u2019s achievements, and\nhe is an inspiration to all of us who see\nhim training hard at the Imperial College boathouse day in, day out.\u201d\nShe went on to say that \u201cThe presence of such a high-achieving student\nathlete in the club spurs everyone on,\nincluding a number of our promising\nyounger rowers who are likely to be\nkey performers not just at ICBC but\nalso in the GB U23 and senior squads\nin the coming years.\u201d\nNeil Mosley, Head of Sport Imperial,\nsaid that he was \u201cdelighted\u201d at Freeman-Pasks achievement and that he\nwas a \u201cfantastic ambassador for Imperial\u201d. This is one of the biggest sporting\nachievements for an Imperial sportsman for some time and he is certain to\nappear in the headlines in the future.\nSenior medal\nfor IC rower\nReaching the end of the race\nfelix Sports\nawards are just\naround the corner\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor-in-Chief\nThe end of the academic year is fastly\napproaching as is the end of the sporting season and as we did last year, we\nwill be giving out our very own awards.\nThe categories for this year can be\nseen in the left hand column and we\nhave decided, in the interest of fair-ness, that for the felix Sportsmanship\naward, which we give out to the most\nsocialable club, that we will let you,\nthe readers, decide who deserves it the\nmost.\nSo if you think that your club has\nbeen the most sociable one, email\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk with the\nclub of your choice and we will get\nthe club some drinks (probably a keg\nof beer, but we\u2019ll see how generous we\nfeel!)\nTo make sure that we get all the facts\nstraight, can we ask you all to have a\nlook at the league table on the right\nand point out any glaring mistakes that\nThe Categories\nfelixSport AWARDS\nTeam of the Year\nClub of the Year\nWomen\u2019s Team of the Year\nMen\u2019s Team of the Year\nBest Medic Team\nSportsman of the Year\nSportswoman of the Year\nfelix Sportsmanship\nWooden Spoon Awards\nWorst Men\u2019s Team\nWorst Women\u2019s Team\nNot won a game\nWorst Club\nwe might have made.\nThe results of this year\u2019s awards will\nbe announced in next weeks issue, as\nwill the ACC colours, so keep your\neyes pealed and find out which teams\nare the top dogs and which ones are\nthe runts of the pack.\nLast year\u2019s felix Sport Team of the Year: IC Men\u2019s 1st Squash Team\ncontinued from back page\nKathleen Duclos (left) and her teammate after their win\nICHC finish off year with high\nPhoto\nby\nPeter\nSpurrier\nof\nIntersport\nImages\nThe 2008/2009 season has proved to\nbe one of the most successful in recent\nhistory, with the return of the Men\u2019s 1st\nXI to the top South-East BUCs league\naccompanied by storming performances across the club. The addition of\na Men\u2019s 5th XI next year demonstrates\nthe thriving club atmosphere encouraging more and more people to join\nevery year. With the season almost\nover and only a selection of Indian\nteams left to play on tour, the annual\nPresident\u2019s day was held last Saturday.\nThe day is a chance for the old-boys\nand girls to return to Fortress Harlington and play some hockey, drink some\nbeer and catch up with old friends. The\ncurrent members also play an important role in organising the day and provide the opposition!\nThe day started with a showcase\nmatch between the Club-Captain\u2019s XI\n(led by Chris Baker Brian) consisting\npredominantly of leavers, who played\nagainst the President\u2019s XI (led by Mark\nRoberton) who were all old-boys. The\ngame took a flying start, but soon most\nwere suffering from the heat and sun\nand the match soon took a slower pace!\nFirst blood went to the older generations in a slick move which left some\nunfit, mid-exam students looking less\nlike young fit whipper-snappers and\nmore like beer drinking, bar hugging\nfatties. The pace once again picked up\nand younger generation fought back\nwith a goal from leaver Lawrence. It\nwas to be the only one from the ClubCaptain\u2019s XI however, and by half time\nthe score was 2-1 to the President\u2019s\nXI. A short half time team talk and rehydration was followed by an intense\nsecond half which saw the youngsters\ndominate for the majority of the time,\nbut the lack of the final finish proved\ncostly. Many chances went wide and\nincreasing pressure on the old-boys\nhalf saw a break away from them result\nin a quick and well worked goal. 3-1\nwas the final score and for the first\ntime in many years the old-boys man- The girls tuck into some Croft\u2019s Pink Port - lovely with lemonade over ice while basking in the sun!\naged to conquer over the young-ones!\nThe rest of the day saw the whole\nclub and all old-boys and old-girls get\ninvolved in a 7-a-side mixed competi-tion. Teams from the West Country,\nLinks, Windy Millers plus the Surfing Old-Girls Squad took on the like\nof Royal College of Science, City and\nGilds and Royal School of Mines. The\ncompetition looked tight and with the\nsun continuing to beam down all teams\nwere suffering the premature summer!\nThere was some rest bite however\n- shade in the form of a bouncy cas-tle, drink in the form of beer and food\nprovided for all made the day far more\nmanageable! The group stages saw\nsome fantastic goals and some horrific\nbanter from the side lines, and the final\nstanding saw teams equal on points. As\nstated in the rules a boat race decided\nthe team\u2019s fates...the results being that\nRSM would play Myra\u2019s Team while\nLinks would play Windy Millers in the\nsemi finals. Both games proved close\nHockey, beer and a bouncy castle - why wouldn\u2019t the President and baby Lucas Roberton smile!\nbut Links and RSM triumphed and\nclashed in the final. Links were confident with a haul of 1st XI players from\nprevious years plus their secret weapon\n- Truffle Shuffle! However, RSM had\nfielded a non-drinking team of tuned\nathletes who took the Links Club to the\ncleaners. Game over. RSM win both\nthe President\u2019s Trophy and the prestigious intercollegiate cup presented by\nStephenson back in the 1950s having\nbeaten both C&G and RCS!\nThe President was happy with the\nday as were his wife and son, Lucas\n(pictured left). The Old-Boys saw glory\nover the younger fitter and better looking current IC members while RSM\ndominated the tournament!\nThe club now looks forward to the\ntour of a lifetime to India and are preparing for next year which will be big-ger, better and more successful than\never! Interested in joining the club? We\ncater for any standard, any age and any\namount of involvement...see you there!\nJack Cornish\nSports Editor\n\n"

    "content": "6 felix Friday 5 June 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFriday 5 June 2009 felix\nComment\nT\nhe Medics are wrong.\nAt least when it comes\nto organisation of the human body. You\u2019ve all seen\nthose posters in the back\nof GCSE Biology of a man stripped to\nhis, as per your teacher\u2019s persuasion,\nskeleton, muscles, or hotpants. Some\nof you may even seen those wonderful Halloween props, the model skel-etons. But I have come to realise that\nthe human body, or mine at the least,\nis something far stranger.\nIt first came to me a few months back\nin the Occupational Health offices.\nFairly routine stuff; check the boxes,\nstamp the forms, oh, and draw a quart\nof my blood for good measure. Well,\nafter several attempts to find a vein, the\nnurse succeeded in drawing...nothing.\nDespite my ruddy complexion, I apparently have no blood. After discovering\nthat I didn\u2019t have a pulse either, I was\nhounded from their offices with much\nscreaming and Holy Water. It wasn\u2019t a\ngood afternoon.\nInstead of the \u201cclassical\u201d models\nanatomy and physiology, humans are,\nin fact, a loose collection of autonomous organs, arranged with no particular care, and held together by wallpaper paste. Perhaps I\u2019m generalising...\nBelow is a brief summary of my abnormal physiology. If you\u2019re interested\nin a Nobel Prize, or perhaps just a\nmovie and dinner, please get in touch\n(rhys.davies08@imperial.ac.uk).\nI\u2019ll start with my mouth because he is\noften the most vocal. Due to his lack of\na brain, he tends to speak first and let\nthe other organs worry later. As such,\nmy mouth often gets me into trouble,\ntrouble which it has no intention of\ngetting me out of. If I\u2019m honest, I detect an air of resentment towards him\nfrom the rest of my body.\nMoving south, we encounter my\nstomach. A much smarter organ by\nfar, it has to deal with a lot of the crap\nMouth shovels in. I think Stomach may\nbe the de facto leader of my organism,\nsince it has no qualms with expelling\nsomething it doesn\u2019t agree with \u2013 it has\na particular grudge against Snakebite.\nIt may have been transplanted into me\nfrom someone with free money \u2013 it\u2019s\noblivious to the entire Sainsbury\u2019s Basics range.\nStomach\u2019s neighbour is my liver. Befitting a student, its favourite past-time\nis getting totally sloshed and hang the\nconsequences. Fortunately, Stomach is\nhis designated driver, which explains\nwhy I\u2019m not on life support right now\nwith alcohol poisoning. I\u2019ve often\nseen Liver talking with Mouth behind\nStomach\u2019s back; I think they\u2019re planning to down a bottle of whiskey when\nhe\u2019s not looking...\nMy hands have the maturity of a\nthree-year-old, and twice the energy.\nIt is their philosophy to do as much is\npossible, despite the fact that there\u2019s\njust the two of them. Even now, as I\n(try to) write this, my left hand is attempting to open a jar of pickled beet-root, for reasons even he doesn\u2019t fully\nunderstand.\nBy contrast, my legs are much more\nlaid back. Actually, they are so laid back\nthat they border on comatose. Any attempt to move anywhere prompts\ncranky groans from them. Why go to\nlectures? They grumble, you\u2019ll just be\nback here again anyway! They are particularly frustrated after a session at\nthe gym. They are not against exercise\nas a rule; they just think it\u2019s for other\nbody parts.\nBody parts such as my heart. He likes\nto exercise away, all day and all night,\neven when all the others organs have\ngone to bed. He\u2019s well-meaning but\ngenerally clueless \u2013 like a Douglas Adams protagonist. If another organ tells\nhim to take a rest or knock the pace\nup a notch, he will, no questions asks.\nStomach largely has him under his\nthumb.\nThe mornings are the worst; after\nMouth has knocked back a crate of Relentless. Heart just doesn\u2019t know when\nto stop...although, I\u2019m glad for that\ncurrently.\nAnd lastly, there is my brain. The\nreason I\u2019m here today and the supposed mastermind of the whole opera-tion. The mind of an Imperial student\nshould sleek and focussed, proving the\nRiemann hypothesis effortlessly, even\nwhen hungover (Bloody Liver!). The\nreality is not nearly so flattering. Brain\nis a bundle of neuroses, psychoses and\noverdoses, with the consistency of\nrice pudding. He\u2019s plagued by OCD,\nADHD, SAD, PMS, SIADH, ABC and\nmany other acronyms. Over-excited by\nall the shiny things that London has to\noffer, the poor dear finds it impossible\nto focus on anything long enough to get\nanything done. His trains of thought\nare from Hornby. This is partly why\nStomach is in charge \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have\na concentration span equal to that of\nan amnesiac goldfish.\nSo there you have it. I will owe my\neventual degree to my stomach and\nmy mouth is plotting a coup d\u2019etat. It\u2019s\ncertainly strange, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\nabnormal. The human body is a fasci-nating, awe-inspiring, positively won-drous...thing! Although, I\u2019m worried\nthat the next time I see Occupational\nHealth, Christian Bale/John Connor\nwill be there waiting for me...\nRhys Davies looks at the body bits of IC students\n\u201cI\u2019ve often seen\nLiver talking with\nMouth behind\nStomach\u2019s back;\nI think they\u2019re\nplanning on\ndowning a bottle\nof whiskey\u201d\nValerio Chang\u2019s humble opinion on the BNP\nI\nknow that this isn\u2019t a very academically solid definition, but\nI think I remember something\nabout molecular Diffusion and\nEntropy talking about reaching\na equilibrium. As scents diffuse and\nheat dissipates from a point source, the\nnature of things in the universe is that\na spread of entities is unstoppable till\na optimum point is reached, and any\neffort to restore order is futile in the\nlong run.\nTaken this analogy to immigration\npolicy, I can only interpret the policies\nof the British National Party as being unnatural and against the laws of\nnature.\nI received a flyer on my doorstep\nurging me to vote for the following\npolicies:\n\u201cCommitted to stemming and reversing the tide of non-white immigration and to restoring, by legal\nchanges, negotiation and consent the\noverwhelmingly white makeup of the\nBritish population that existed in Britain prior to 1948.\u201d\n\u201cFirm but voluntary incentives for\nimmigrants and their descendants to\nplace of ethnic origin.\u201d\nRestricts party membership to \u201cindigenous British ethnic groups deriving from the class of \u2018Indigenous Caucasian\u2019\u201d. The BNP also accepts white\nimmigrants that are assimilated into\none of those ethnicities.\nThe BNP asserts that there are biological racial differences that determine the behaviour and character of\nindividuals of different races, although\nit also claims that it does not regard\nwhites as superior to other ethnic\ngroups. The party claims that preference for one\u2019s own ethnicity is a part of\nhuman nature.\nUnlike what other people say, I don\u2019t\nthink the BNP is racist, or white su-premacists, I just think their policies\ndon\u2019t make sense, I have gripes with\nevery sentence in the above article:\n1) They are isolating Caucasians and\nnon Caucasians, with no other logic\nthan saying it\u2019s human nature.

I\ndon\u2019t recall the subject of his\ntalk but it was illuminating and\ngot the intellectual juices flowing nonetheless.\nQuestion time approached and I\nhad the perfect question to challenge\nthis brilliant, albeit arrogant, mind. If\nwe are simply the sum of our chemical parts, our DNA which wants only\nto propagate its existence indefinitely,\nthen why does love exist? Animals and\nhuman beings have proved since the\ndays of Caligula and before that love\nis not required to get sperm to egg (or\notherwise), so what can be Dawkins\u2019\nexplanation for this elusive four letter word? Alas, I crumbled under the\npressure of addressing this prestigious figure and my question was left\nunanswered.\nLove is undoubtedly one of the most\nsought after and ethereal things in our\nworld if one is to go by painting, po-etry, prose and the hoards of internet\ndating sites promising the stuff. It is\nthe thing which keeps us from despairing and keeps us persisting, a thing of\ncomfort or maybe of immense pain.\nLove comes in many forms \u2013 Eros (ro-mantic, passionate), Ludus (one played\nas a game), Storge (friendship), Pragma\n(undemonstrative), Mania (obsessive),\nAgape (motherly). Anyone reading\nthis will have experienced at least one\ntype, although it is Eros that is the\nmost idolised. I must make a distinction between love and lust for the two\nare quite different. Lust has us beauti-fying, slimming, pumping iron, flirt-ing, drinking, networking \u2013 in short\nanything that will ultimately end in the\nexchange of bodily fluids. Love makes\nus want to do the above but then also\nmakes us want to stay for time afterwards to talk, listen, comfort and enjoy\ntime with that person we have chosen.\nI have always wondered about\nDawkins\u2019 wife - both of them, for he\ngot divorced from the first one. If your\nhusband firmly believes that we are\nonly here as a result of our genes\u2019 insatiable drive to persist and that the\nwhole purpose of our existence is to\nproduce offspring, then that does not\nleave much room for any fanciful notions such as romance and reasons for\nspending a fulfilling life with someone.\nIt is something I wonder, too, about\natheists. I am referring to the hardcore,\nnihilistic types and not agnostics who\nhave not decided either way. How are\nthese atheists able to bring themselves\nto do anything, find purpose in any-thing, get up in the morning if we are\nindeed nothing and will eventually be\neven less after we die. Why bother at\nall?\nI was raised a Catholic and so I have\na sort of \u2018instinct\u2019, which has been instilled in me by my parents, that there\nis something greater at work, something going on behind the scenes. Or\nperhaps it is arrogance on my part and\nI refuse to accept that I am only flesh\nand bones and blood and a few chemicals that are released at convenient\ntimes to make me believe I am angry,\nsad, and joyful or in love.\nScientists have come up with a molecular mechanism for \u201cfalling in love\u201d\n(actually falling in lust) which identifies hormones, pheromones and\ndopamine as some of the factors which\nbring about that heady rush of pas-sion. Is that all it is \u2013our body, driven\nby our genes, deciding it wants to sow/\nreceive a seed and then tricking our\nminds into thinking something greater\nis at work? Indeed, there is little doubt\nabout chemical changes that occur in\nthe body when our senses behold the\none we love, but why should a scientific\nexplanation extinguish any possibility\nthat something deeper and unexplain-able is going on?\nThe gradual shift from having God\nas the basis of our faith to Science as\nour faith (certainly among many in\nthe western world) has brought about\na general consensus that it is either or\nand that there can be no symbiosis between the two.\nFalling in love, even if there is more\nto it than dopamine, may not be an indication or proof of God, but if you can\nnot believe that you are with your love\nbecause of something more profound\nand special than as a by-product of innate biology then it makes the notion\nof love a rather dismal and futile one.\nPerhaps the reason behind the end of\nRichard\u2019s first marriage is more obvious now.\nLove versus atheism? Caz Knight decides\n\u201cLove comes in\nmany forms [...]\nmany will have\nexperienced at\nleast one type,\nalthough it is\nEros that is the\nmost idolised\u201d\nphoenix\nOUT NOW!!\nget your copy\nwith felix today!\n\n"

FreemanPask replaced Olympic Gold medallist\nZac Purchase, who couldn\u2019t race due to\nillness, in the lightweight single skull\nrace and went on to win his first senior medal.\nIn the final of the Lightweight Men\u2019s\nSingle Sculls (LM1x), Freeman-Pask\nwas up against some stiff opposition,\nincluding several Olympic medallists\nsuch as Denmark\u2019s Mads Rasmussen\nand Greece\u2019s Vasileios Polymeros. At\nthe start of the race Rasmussen shot off\nto a commanding start with Polymeros\nclose on his heels. At the halfway\npoint, however, it was Italy\u2019s 33-year-old Lorenzo Bertini who was in the\nlead and with 500m to go he had been\ntaken over by Polymers. In the final\nstretch of the race, Rasmussen had begun to fade which gave Freeman-Pask\nthe opportunity to capitalise. At the\nfinishing line, it was Polymer who went\naway with the gold medal, with Bertini\ngetting the silver and Imperial\u2019s Adam\nFreeman-Pask getting the bronze.\nFreeman-Pask described the whole\nexperience as \u201cpretty scary with all\nthese big names.

This includes its Hummer brand which the\nChinese manufacturing firm Tengzhong has signed a tentative agreement to\nbuy.\nAdditionally GM\u2019s China operations are not affected by its bankruptcy sta-tus, so it continues to operate profitably there, enjoying a 33% rise in sales\nsince the beginning of this year and even planning to open a new factory. The\nthirst for new cars is still strong in China where most people will be first time\ncar-owners, which has caused automobile companies to flock to the booming\nmarket in recent years.\nUSA & China\nAustralia is launching a formal inquiry into violent attacks on its Indian\nstudents.\nWhile crimes like robberies and assaults are not uncommon on the streets\nof Victoria State, the country\u2019s Indian expatriate community of around\n200,000 (90,000 of whom are students) believe an unusually high number of\nthe crimes are racially motivated. Comments from the Indian Prime Minister\nSingh, and a protest attended by thousands of Indians in Melbourne got that\npoint across.\nSome observers have said that because most of the violent crimes were\nsuffered by Indian students working part-time as salesmen or taxi-drivers, it\nis symptomatic of feelings of economic insecurity among locals. But others\nhave argued the crimes are being committed by ordinary opportunistic gangs\nmaking money, and that there\u2019s no need to jump on the racist bandwagon.\nThe inquiry will determine the extent of racism involved and recommend\nactions for the government to take.\nAustralia\nThree US soldiers have died in a car accident on a German autobahn\n(motorway).\nAnother two soldiers were also injured when their rented Audi drove off\nthe side of the road. All five belonged to a division that had just returned\nfrom a 15-month deployment in Iraq.\nThe first doctors on the scene suspected that alcohol may have been in-volved. The soldiers were on a reintegration program designed to help them\nadjust to life after combat deployment, in which alcohol abuse is a known\ndocumented problem.\nThe United States has several military bases across Germany, including as\npart of NATO, ever since the end of the Second World War.\nGermany\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nMore election results than\nyou can throw a stick at\nElection fever well and truly hit the\nstudents of Imperial this week when almost 2 % of students raised their heads\nfrom revision for long enough to elect\ncurrent Sabbaticals Hannah Theodorou, as Equal Opportunities Officer,\nand Mark Chamberlain as council\nchair. Chamberlain had a tough fight to\nsucceed the Little Guy with Big Ideas,\nbeating Jamie Henry by only ten votes.\nJoseph Freer successfully fought\noff RON to become Community Action Group Chair for the coming year,\npledging to make CAG \u2018flourish\u2019 and\nmove beyond \u2018the Sunday soup run.\u2019.\nRAG chair was won by Alexander\nDahinten, who, for a week last term,\nwas known as the dishiest clown on\ncampus. Dahinten\u2019s main pledge was\nto avoid another \u2018Dashless\u2019 year with\nthe indroduction of a RAG dash organ-iser. Rumours that the felix team are\nalready planning ways to \u2018miss-place\u2019\nincoming editor Dan Wan through\nclever use of the RAG dash are thought\nto be unfounded.\nAlex Gill narrowly defeated RON\nto become Welfare Campaigns of-ficer, using his manifesto to proclaim;\n\u201cThis is for my CV\u201d and \u201cI come up\nwith around 5 ideas a week, admittedly\nthese aren\u2019t all relevant to the welfare\nof Imperial College students, but I believe that approximately 10% of these\nideas could be implemented on campus\u201d. With promises like that, students\ncan expect particularly strong welfare\nrepresentation this year.\nThe newly formed position of InterAlice Rowlands\nnational Students\u2019 Officer was, somewhat embarrassingly, unfilled with the\nonly interested candidate \u2018forgetting\u2019\nto put themselves up for nomination.\nAside from the Central Union Officer Elections, the Graduate School\nAssociation elections took place with\na surprisingly high 1% turn out.

Using this \u2018evidence\u2019\nyou then proceeded to diminish Mrs\nAbbott\u2019s argument of too much white\npeople and too few black people at the\ntwo universities.\nWithout trying to second guess Mrs\nAbbott\u2019s intentions too much, she\nprobably doesn\u2019t care much for international students. What her comments were really talking about were\nhome students, the 52% blue chunk\nfor Imperial College and 30% for LSE.\nYour statistics were analysing a different issue to the one Mrs Abbott was\nrambling on about, namely the entry of\nblack students from UK schools to top\nPie charts were\nmisleading\nWe are ever vigilant\nabout fluent\nspeakers\nDear Editor,\nI was saddened to read in the Times\nHigher Education Supplement that\nImperial is massively cutting back its\nprovision of languages and humanities\ntuition.\nThe opportunity to broaden study\noptions was one of the reasons I, and\nI\u2019m sure many other IC students and\nalumni, chose to go to Imperial. Engineers and scientists at other universities tend to just get a handful of\nfrankly boring management courses.\nAs a practising engineer I can confirm\nthat the wide opportunity to study languages and humanities produces more\nrounded graduates better equipped to\nfulfill the leadership roles required in\ntoday\u2019s multi-disciplinary and multi-functional workplaces. It\u2019s something\nI\u2019ve always considered just as important as the wide range of student clubs,\nsocieties and sports.\nLanguage tuition is also essential\nto widen students\u2019 opportunities for\na year abroad or overseas internship.\nMany of my friends at IC were able\nto pursue these. In every case it contributed much to their personal de-velopment.

Diane\nAbbott M.P. to this university is justified to some extent. \u201cApartheid\u201d is escaping the views of the professors and\nother members of the alumni because\nall of them are busy in the rat race to\ncomplete their tasks and achieve their\nset objectives. The society at large has\nlots of loopholes to defend their selfish behaviour and segregation into\nown taste groups; and even if a lonely\nsoul does try to join or mingle amongst\nthem he is called \u201cpushy\u201d or even some\npeople ideaology is that \u201cdogs and cats\ndon\u2019t mix\u201d.\nUniversities were established to\nsolve problems like apartheid or any\nother related ethnic minority issues attached to such type of social confron-tations. If the educated people do not\npractice tolerance, equal treatment,\nequal opportunities, then who will?\nThe uuniversities should try to inject\nthis vitamin of \u201cpeace\u201d with awards of\ndegrees and doctorates in excellence\nof subjects examined. Multiculturaled\neducational institutions need to have\nflexible, openminded professors and\nstaff rather than colonial type majors\nwho ruled with fear-of-the-master\nphilosophy. Thus treating the ethnic\nminorities in a negative manner can\noly result in a negative impact on the\nuniversity. By Newton\u2019s Law, to every\naction there is an equal and opposite\nreaction.\nBecause the graduates are at the\nmercy of the university, so they play\ndumb hence I wish to congratulate\nHon. Lady M.P. Diane Abbott to raising shy-hidden student\u2019s secrets and\ntaboos which all add up to their imposed stress obstacles.\nRegards\nAnon.\nuniversities which a lot of her work as\nan MP involves.\nWhile I am disgusted at Mrs Abbott\u2019s\nuse of the word apartheid its helpful to\nuse relevant statistics - even though\nthey may be hard to find - so the reader\ncan compare like with like rather than\nbe misled, which statistics can all too\neasily achieve.\nRegards\nHassan Joudi\n............................................\nDear Hassan\nThe article was based around her use of\nthe word apartheid. We looked up several definitions of the word, all of which\nstated that it was \u201cAn institutionalized\nregime of racial segregation or oppres-sion, in which crimes against humanity are committed with the intention of\nmaintaining one group\u2019s racial domi-nance.\n\u201d It is very easy for people to associate the word apartheid with the regime in South Africa where the blacks\nAfricans were oppressed and attacked\nby the white Africans, however, the\nword can be applied to any race of peo-ple, wether they be oriental, hispanic,\nslavic, celtic etc...\nThe pie charts were there to support our claim that there was no clear\napartheid at either institution, based\non the definition of the word that we\nhad found.\nI too am disgusted by the her use of\nthe word apartheid, and it was the\nmain reason that we ran with the story.\nKind Regards\n5\nFriday 5 June 2009 felix\nthe new plans.\nImperial\u2019s provision is, I believe,\nunique for science students in the UK;\nbut not amongst the Ivy League institutions that we now know the Rector is so keen to emulate. It\u2019s perhaps\nworth noting that the condemned Roman History module was introduced\nat IC in 2005, in response to MIT announcing that it was their most popular option amongst their engineering\nstudents.\nPerusing felix online I was surprised\nto see a comment that languages are\nseen as a soft option. That might be\ntrue of a small number of students\nwho cover up their existing language\nproficiency but it\u2019s an extraordinary\ngeneralisation to make. I\u2019m sure most\nstudents whose natural talent is in nu-merate, scientific disciplines find both\nlanguage and essay-type subjects difficult and hard work. Certainly I found\nmy French, Italian and political philosophy courses much harder than any\nengineering module. I know it\u2019s been a\ncouple of years since I graduated but\nwe always used to consider the management courses as the noddy ones:\ndoes anone seriously think \u201caccounting\u201d is even in the same league as \u201cfluid\ndynamics\u201d?\nI know protests have been planned.\nI hope IC students are able to reverse\nthese plans and the College is able to\nfind a way to keep humanities and languages alive.\nRegards\nMustafa Arif\nDoC / EEE 1999-2003\nIC Union President 2003-2005\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nfelix Editor-in-Chief\nT\nhe last week or so has seen\na flurry of interest in humanities teaching at Imperial following proposed\nchanges to the department\u2019s delivery of teaching. I believe\nthere have been some misconceptions\namongst students following the release of this information, including the\nprocess of the review and the reasons\nbehind it and I feel it\u2019s my responsibility to shed some light on them. The\ndecision to review the activities of the\nHumanities Department was originally made in May 2008 by the Strategic Education Committee. The aim\nwas not to cut courses, save money\nor remove jobs but to provide some\nrationalisation to the way we deliver\nthe various courses. Money wasn\u2019t a\ndriver- at this point we were blissfully\nunaware of the financial turmoil that\nwas to come. Availability of classes had\nbeen determined by sporadic demand.\nThe growth was uneven- we don\u2019t currently teach Level 1 and 2 French, but\ndo so for Spanish for example. There\nwere also disparities across the College which needed to be addressed in\nlight of the College\u2019s intent to make all\ncourses Bologna compatible (transfer-able across Europe). When I first heard\nof the review around Christmas it was\nalready common knowledge amongst\nthe Humanities staff and the academics in Engineering and the Natural Sciences. By this point most of the information gathered for the review panel,\nwhich consisted of both academic representatives and humanities staff, had\nbeen collated and a set of recommendations drafted. These encompassed\nissues ranging from the role humanities plays as part of undergraduate\ndegrees, provision for Postgraduates,\nECTS scores and the structure of the\nCollege day which currently includes\nprotected lunchtimes for humanities\nteaching. The release of this information following Senate has seen the formation of facebook groups, petitions,\nnational press coverage, letters to Felix\nand numerous emails popping up in\nmy inbox suggesting that on this occasion I have not been representative\nof student views which I fully take on\nboard.\nContrary to popular belief, the discussion about the place of Level 1 and\n2 languages as credit courses has been\na debate that has been rumbling for\nyears. However, this was the first time\nit had been put forward for a decision.\nSenate is designed to be the ultimate\nrepresentative body- if a proposal falls\nhere then it won\u2019t be implemented.\nWhen the paper went to Senate there\nwere some comments but in the end\nthe proposal passed with little objections from the academics. The only\nway students are going to win the argument that Levels 1 and 2 should be\nkept as credit courses is if the academics (who, in addition to the Student\nUnion, are there to represent your interests too) turn around and say they\nvalue the part they play in their degree\ncourses. It\u2019s not a message I have heard\nloud and clear so far. Many students\nand languages staff have called the\nother cuts arbitrary, as we see some\nlanguages disappearing from the credit programme altogether. Far from being arbitrary cuts, the reason Italian,\nRussian and Arabic will no longer be\noffered for credit is because they are\ncurrently only taught at Levels 1 and\n2 only (apart from Russian which extends to Level 3). Teaching hours for\ncredit are also decreasing, the reason\nbeing the Languages staff have said\nthis will not compromise the teaching.\nIf employability is the most important attraction for students who come\nto Imperial, the College\u2019s educational\nstrategy needs to focus on this. Feedback from employers has been that\ndespite the excellent academic calibre\nof our students, they simply aren\u2019t performing sufficiently well at interviews\nand assessment centres. It sounds\nharsh, but sometimes we\u2019re not viewed\nas team players or good communica-tors. Language skills are, of course,\ninvaluable in a global workplace.\nHowever, employers are looking for\nadvanced-level European languages as\na whole, not pre-GCSE. The ability to\ncommunicate to a wide range of audi-ences, and understanding the wider\nsocial implications of the work that we\ndo by all of our students by integrating this into the undergraduate programme has long seen to be of utmost\nimportance, particularly at institutions\nwith a strong Science and Engineering base where we were traditionally trained to be knowledge focussed\ninstead.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong- I understand\nthe important role that Humanities has\nplayed in a lot of your university experiences and employability isn\u2019t the only\nreason students choose them. On a\nstudent experience note, Imperial has\nto set priorities that they believe and\nunderstand to be important to our stu-dents. Students fit into the setting of\nthis agenda, through representation on\nCollege Committees and other means\nsuch as national and internal surveys\nwell as other things we don\u2019t immediately appreciate such as letters to Felix.\nFrom first hand experience, your concerns are being listened to.\nI do believe that further tweaks could\nand should be accommodated, but I\nHannah Theodorou discusses Humanities\nWhile not known for its democratic institutions, on Sunday 7 and Thursday 12 June the Middle East will be watching on as Lebanese and Iranian\ncitizens respectively vote in significant elections.\nIn Lebanon the parliamentary elections will be a showdown between the\ntwo main coalitions, dubbed March 8 and March 14 after two gigantic rallies\nwhich took place in 2005. But reducing Lebanese politics to two broad coalitions is perhaps the over-simplification of the century. The tiny country on\nthe Mediterranean Sea is a cocktail of ethnicities, religious sects and political\ninterference by foreign states which was once lethal as the 1975-1990 civil\nwar testifies to.\nMeanwhile in Iran the seat of President, the official head of state, is up for\ngrabs. Current President Ahmadinejad is campaigning for re-election against\ntwo reformist candidates: Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi.\nWith US President Obama\u2019s shrewdly timed visit to the region this week, it\nis another vital cross road on the story of the Middle East\u2019s political landscape.\nLebanon & Iran\nAlex Dahinten and Mark Chamberlain both got elected\nStatement from the Rector:\nC\nolleagues may have seen\nreports in the media over\nthe past few days stating that I wish to free\nthe College from government control. To actually do so would\nrequire a proposal, a debate and a\ndecision within the College and at its\nCouncil that has not taken place. The\nmedia\u2019s emphasis is inevitable but the\nheadlines obscure the real debate I\nam calling for, which I hope to explain\nhere, and have consistently stated in\nrecent press interviews.\nAs I have said in Q&A sessions with\nstaff (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/rec-tor/yourquestions) at Hammersmith\nand Silwood in the last week, the College is facing very tough economic\ntimes. We are going to see significant\ncuts in UK public expenditure on science and higher education in the coming years, which will be felt for a long\nperiod hereafter. Imperial must argue\nforcefully against these cuts being applied equally across the sector and in\nparticular to the detriment of the UK\u2019s\nworld class universities.\nIn addition there are three key issues\nwe must confront.\nWe must have the freedom we need\nto set our own fees for all our courses.\nThe value of an Imperial degree is not\nreflected in the income we receive. A\nserious debate about student fees is required and we have to raise its visibil-ity. However, in any changes proposed,\nwe must be absolutely confident that\nthey would not deter prospective students who would flourish at the College. I have repeatedly stressed we are\ncommitted as a College to encouraging\nstudents from any background and\nto try and prevent financial circumstances acting as a barrier to entry to\nImperial.\nSecondly, we must seriously consider the opportunities open to us on\nthe global stage. In the growing demography of highly qualified potential\nstudents from overseas, in particular\nChina and India, there will be a huge\ndemand for British universities to provide their high quality education to the\nworld.\nThirdly, and touching on a matter\nflowing directly from Imperial\u2019s founding mission: universities are the source\nof discoveries that, if commercialised,\ncan be used to assist the UK economy\nin its recovery. When this country\nis crying out for a long-term industrial strategy, and our universities are\nplaced so well to support this through\nthe supply of people and ideas, we cannot stay silent and must position ourselves to influence thinking.\nIt is an often-overlooked fact that\nthe UK is excellent at providing higher\neducation. It is an industry worth \u00a345\nbillion to the UK. The fact that we have\nfour universities in the world top 10\nunderlines Britain\u2019s standing. To harm\nthese \u2018brand leaders\u2019 would be to hurt\nthe whole sector.\nThe UK\u2019s leading universities should\nbe properly supported and nurtured; if\nthey can\u2019t be, we should debate whether they should be set free. But doing\nnothing would imperil a unique culture\nand an international asset. My responsibility is to lead the College through\nthis period of economic difficulty and\nto build a platform for its future suc-cess, and in doing so I believe we have\nmuch to offer the UK.\nAs ever I warmly welcome your comments direct to me at rector@imperial.\nac.uk.\nSir Roy Anderson provides some context to Imperial staff about\nthe recent media coverage over his recent statement to privatise\nHigher Education\nSir Roy Anderson\ndon\u2019t think the answer is fighting for\neverything to be saved with no other\nreason than \u2018because we want them\u2019.\nIn an ideal world, we would continue\nto let students study any language that\nthey choose for free but in an unstable\nfinancial climate we have to set pri-orities. I feel that sometimes Imperial\nmakes life difficult for itself on occa-sions- I believe the expectations of our\nstudents exceed those of most other\nBritish universities. When we started\ncharging for laundry in halls, in line\nwith every student residence in the UK,\nit upset scores of students. It doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean that it was the wrong\nthing to do. Residences didn\u2019t respond\nto requests to revert to the old system.\nInstead, they listened when we asked\nfor an extension to the drying time and\nincreases in the number of machines\navailable in certain halls. Other things\nI do think we take for granted, such as\nunprecedented free access to a gym\nwhich most Londoners would kill for\nare only fully appreciated when we are\nthreatened with their removal.\nIn summary, I\u2019m open to hearing\nyour views and I will pass them on as\nlong as we have our own feasible rec-ommendations. The first step is a discussion at our Student Union Council\non Monday the 8th of June at 6.30pm\nin the Union Dining Hall which all students are welcome to. If you can\u2019t make\nit, carry on sending me emails (dpew@\nimperial.ac.uk), posting on facebook\nand Live and writing to felix I look forward to engaging with students on this\ndebate.\n\n"

With drinks\npromotions, such as \u00a32.50 for a single\nvodka/whiskey + mixer and an entry\nfee of only \u00a35, its perfect for us skint\nstudents. And students it was full of,\njust not Imperial ones.\nThe music played was not what you\nmight expect given the name of the\nclub, and there was nobody sporting a\ngreen mohawk, covered in tattoos and\nSo you\u2019ve never been to Punk? Charlotte\nMorris wonders why the hell not?\npiercings. Instead, the Punk DJs gave\nus an eclectic mix of electro-indie;\nfrom brand new chart hits such as La\nRoux \u2018In for the kill\u2019 and Metro Station\u2019s \u2018Shake it\u2019, to electro (mostly Justice) remixes of pretty much anything,\nanything you can dance along to. They\neven managed to throw in some classic\nProdigy and RUN DMC towards the\nend of the night and kindly managed to\nrefrain from playing The Killers, Vampire Weekend and all the other indie\ncheese that everyone knows the words\nto but we can all live without.\nThe words I\u2019d use to describe the\ninterior would be \u2018small but perfectly\nformed\u2019. It\u2019s stylish decor and a dance\nfloor that you don\u2019t stick to makes you\nrealise why Punk charges you \u00a315 to\nget in on any other night. And yes, it\nwas rather small in comparison to Fabric, Koko and such-like, but bigger definitely doesn\u2019t mean better in this case.\nThe small size of the place just added\nto the friendly, inviting atmosphere of\nthe place.\nOf all the clubs I\u2019ve been to in London, this is the only one I can honestly\ndescribe as friendly. Everyone seemed\nto be simply out to have a good time,\nno snobbery, no dodgy looks. I could\nstand to queue at the bar without going insane because the people around\nme weren\u2019t trying to crush me against\nit or shouting in my ear. I didn\u2019t even\nmind sharing my cigarettes with those\n\u2018social smokers\u2019, because they actually were being social. In fact, one of\nthe highlights of my night was talking\nto new people, either at the bar or in\nthe smokers area (which was a small\nstretch of pavement across the street,\n\t\t\n\t\t PUNK\nEntry: \u00a35 Mondays. \u00a315 Weekends\nNearest Tube : Tottenham Court Road\n\t\t HHHHH\nand my friend was sick on it - how em-barrassing). We were sat outside, getting some air when some guy comes\nup and asks to borrow a lighter, we\noblige and he proceeds to tell us his life\nstory. Annoying, you might think? No,\nit was hilarious. It was the first time I\u2019d\nheard a story that had no point to it\nand I didn\u2019t care about since I read Jade\nGoody\u2019s obituary. I find it very rare in\nLondon when people will approach\nyou and start talking complete rubbish\nto you. The story he told ended with\n\u2018And then I moved to London, I think,\nI don\u2019t know why. Actually, where do I\nlive?\u2019. I couldn\u2019t help him answer that\none, and my friend was in hysterics, so\nwe returned to the dance floor.\nGranted, there were a few indie-Cindys, who, unfortunately, got in the\nway when Topshop on Oxford Street\nRegent Street or Camden?\nwas projectile vomiting, and also a few\nof the type of guys who wear black-rimmed glasses on a night out even\nthough they don\u2019t need them to see,\nwhich I personally find slightly insult-ing, as I do have to wear glasses in order to see, and those little red marks I\nget on the side of my nose after having\nlab specs over my prescription glasses\nactually HURT! So lets not take they\npiss guys, eh? If you don\u2019t need them,\ndon\u2019t wear them.\nBut you are going to get those people at any indie night, anywhere in the\nUK. And a Punk you can kind of let\nthat go, because the majority of people\nwere really fun, and that made the atmosphere so enjoyable. We had a great\nnight there, I\u2019d definitely recommend\nit. So I\u2019ll see you there next Monday,\nyeah?\nRegent St might be expensive, but Camden Town will give it a run for its money on cocktails\nSketch, situated on Conduit Street,\njust off Regent Street, is possibly one\nof the most expensive and exclusive\nbars I have yet visited in London. And\nif you\u2019re up for rubbing shoulders with\nthe A-list celebs then I guess this is\nas good a spot as any, with the likes\nof Pixie Geldof and Nick Grimshaw,\namong other London socialites, frequenting both the cocktail bar and the\n(extortionately priced) restaurant.\nI have to say, the best thing about this\nbar would have to be the toilets. I know\nthat very few people start a review by\ntalking about the quality and cleanliness of the toilets, but these have to\nbe seen to be believed. The stairs up\nto the toilets look as though somebody\nspilled a giant bottle of red nail varnish\nall over them. Once inside the toilets,\nthey\u2019re dazzling; covered in diamant\u00e9\nand mirrors, they were immaculate.\nThere was also a woman dressed in a\nFrench Maid\u2019s outfit, standing to give\nme a hand towel. As I took the towel\nfrom her hand, I thought to myself,\n\u2018Have Bob Geldof\u2019s children ever\npicked up a hand towel for themselves?\u2019. I doubt it.\nEnough of toilets, the decor in the\nrest of the bar was similarly grand. The\nParlour bar is kitted out with as much\nmodern art as four science students\ncould possibly cope with. Yet we sat\nthere and admired the art\nand the fabulous interior design of the bar from our comfortable armchairs and chaise\nlounges.\nThe cocktails were of excellent\nquality and table service is always a\nbonus. The cocktail menu could have\nbeen more extensive; cocktails need\nnot be limited to those which are made\nwith champagne. And the champagne\ncontent was definitely reflected in the\nprice; around \u00a312-\u00a315 per cocktail and\n\u00a321 for a bottle of (very average) wine.\nAnd yes, I know you\u2019re wondering, it\nwas the cheapest on the menu, and the\nwine prices rose pretty steeply after\nthat.\nA spot of people-watching revealed\nthat the people surrounding me were\nnot what I had previously expected.\nInstead of the trendy \u2018I-can-never-betoo-rich-or-too-skinny\u2019 girls which\ncan be expected at bars such as Mahiki\u2019s, we got a few slightly-too-old and\nslightly-too-Botoxed blonde women.\nIn place of the popped-collars of pink\npolo shirts below spikey highlighted\nhair, we got tired-looking thirty-some-things, still wearing their braces or\nwaistcoats from their day in the City.\nHowever, watching them was quite\nentertaining, and I could go back for\nmore, if somebody else was paying.\nPunk: Small but perfectly formed\nFifty-five bar, a couple of minutes walk\nfrom Camden Town\ntube station, is quite\na contrast with Sketch.\nBusy and noisy, there were\nno celebs present, or bankers;\nthey were replaced with students and\npeople dressed in slightly more \u2018alternative\u2019 attire. As it\u2019s just around the\ncorner from Camden High Street, it\u2019s\nalso off the beaten tourist track, which\nis always nice when you\u2019re so close\nto the tourist haven that is Camden\nMarket.\nThe best time to head to fifty-five bar\nis early. We went on our way to Koko,\nbut it would probably be better to go\nthere after a day shopping or wondering round the market, as they have\na brilliant 2-for-1 offer on cocktails,\nwhich are not very expensive to start\nwith. At under \u00a37 for a cocktail (which\nis two cocktails between 6-8pm), fifty-five bar is great value for money, and\nthe cocktails were surprisingly good.\nThere are a number of cocktail bars,\nwhich are much closer to home, that\nprobably charge around the same price\nfor a cocktail; you could easily compare\nthem to fifty-five bar, the likes of B@\none and Suburban. However, the quality of cocktails at these places leave a\nlittle to be desired. Fifty-five bar, on the\nother hand provides excellent quality\ncocktails at a very reasonable price.\nThe staff were very friendly, accomplished jugglers, and also surprisingly\nhelpful, advising us on what to choose\nand explaining how they use egg\nwhites to balance the flavour, blend the\ndrink and add body to it, while adding\na foamy head for aesthetics. You learn\nsomething new every day.\nAnd the flavours of the cocktails\nwere well balanced, and very enjoy-able. The variety on the menu meant\nthat you could stay there all day and\nnot have the same thing twice, except\nyou would, because you liked it. They\nhad everything from your classic \u2018Black\nRussians\u2019 to \u2018FBI\u2019s\u2019; a lovely mixture\nof Finlandia Vodka, Baileys and Icecream (best for after dinner).\nThe relaxed atmosphere was reflected in the interior decor, comfy leather\nsofas and stools next to small wooden\ntables. The low lighting allowed can-dle-light to flicker off the posters which\ndecorated the deep-red coloured walls,\nposters of rock bands from the 70\u2019s and\n80\u2019s. They had the same bands playing\nin the background; mostly a mixture\nof brit-pop with classic rock from the\n70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s.\nIt was an excellent venue for pre-lash\nand I will definitely be heading back\nnext time I\u2019m in Camden.\nSketch\nimperialcollegeunion.org/ball\nSummer Ball 2009\nImperial College London\nSaturday 20 June\nCABARET STAGE\n(THE DOCTOR & THE PENCIL)\nTHE GLOBE GIRLS JAZZ BIG BAND\nNOEL FIELDING & DAVE BROWN\n\u00a340\nENTERTAINMENTS\n\u00a375\nDINNER\nLIVE ARENA\nATHLETE\nROSIE & THE GOLDBUG TAPE THE RADIO\nBATTLE OF THE BANDS WINNER\nJEFF AUTOMATIC CLUB NME\nALSO...\nDANCE VENUE\nPENDULUM\nCHASE & STATUS FEAT MC RAGE\n(EL HORNET DJ SET) FEAT MC JAKES\nINTERLOPE (LIVE)\nKILLA KELA SCRATCH PERVERTS\n\u2022 FUN FAIR\n\u2022 BIG WHEEL\n\u2022 DODGEMS\n\u2022 AMAZING LIGHT SHOWS\n\u2022 3D PROJECTIONS\n\u2022 FOOD VANS\n\u2022 WANDERING ACTS\n\u2022 FIREWORKS\n\u2022 SURVIVORS\u2019 PHOTO\n\u2022 TONI & GUY HAIR SALON\n\u2022 PROFESSIONAL\nPHOTOGRAPHER\nF\nF\nF\nFE\nE\nF\nF\nFE\nE\n15DAYS TO GO!\n\n"
