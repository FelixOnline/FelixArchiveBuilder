    "content": "2 FELLX\nRCS row continues\nOn the admission of President Keith Cavanagh, the Union meeting held\non Tuesday was adjourned in chaos. At the time of adjourning Mr. Frank\nFud-'., with other students, was challenging the vote which had just\nbet.; taken on the motion that R CSU should withdraw from NUS. At\nthat meeting the President had not ruled on the challenge to the vote and\nhis first move on Thursday was to rule that a revote be not granted. This\nruling was then challenged and Cavanagh quitted the chair in order to\ntake part in the debate. The Vice-President Dick Conn took the chair.\nIt was stated taut accusations had been made mat certain persons hau completed more than out ballot slip.\nAl least one such person had been\nidentified mou gii Ills name was not\nrevealed, Afi esn vote would also\ngive t ne Union a chance to think again about the motion but this\npu in t was disputed. In his reply to\nmo challenge President Cavanagh explained matt ne re is noway ot\nensuring that any such ballot is\nvalid and stated t natt ne chance of\nreconsideration was not a valid cn allen ge to any motion. Paper bal lot slips were distributed after a show of hands proved inconclusive.\nThe holding of tn is ballot was quest-i one d and the Hon. Sec. Jeffrey\nWarren stated that methods of voting were not covered by the constitution. Revote\nThe result of the ballot was that\nthe motion: that a revote be taken\non the motion debated at the previous meeting, received For143 and Against156. It followed that the\nmotion that RCS withdraw from\nNUS was carried.\nThe rest of the meeting was con-cer end with the motion tabled by\nMessrs. Doe and Needham that \" The vote taken on NUS was not truly\nrepresentative arid that a ballot be\ntaken throughout RCS\". Mr. Doe\nseated *** motion without elaborating on u aud a, speaker-against was\ncalled. Tnis was Martin Lack who\nexplained that the motion was tabled Hurriedly after the first NUS debate at wu icu they felt that more\ntime lor consideration was needed\nana more t acts should be presented\nto the members of the Union. Since\nthen there had been considerable\npublicity and anyone at all interested in the issue would have attended the meeting on Tuesday,\ntherefore it would be pointless to\nhold a referendum in order that uninterested parties might vote.\nBallot\nAt this point Mr. Boothman proposed to amend to the motion.\nDuring the time following the tabling of the motion it had lost much\nof its relevance and he was therefore proposing an amendment which\nhad been agreed on by Mr. Doe.\nThe amendment read:\" The RCS Union instructs its General Committee to take a ballot throughout the\nwhole College to determine the\nwishes of the Union on affiliation to\nNUS and instructs its General Committee to act in accordance with\nits wishes\". Mr. Boothman explained\nthat it was intended to delete the\nfirst clause of the original motion\nand to include much of the second.\nA CARER IN6(TO III Modem developments in the Generating Board such as Advanced Gas Cooled\nReactors and the 400 kV transmission super grid require graduates of the highest\ncalibre. Our graduate training schemes are intended for mechanical and electrical\nengineers and honours physicists who are interested in a career in operational\naspects of the Board's work.\nThe Board is carrying out a number of research programmes closely related to its\nengineering interests.

Brooks;\nRecruitment and University Liaison Officer, Sudbury House, 15 Newgate\nStreet, London E.C.1. CENTRAL ELECTRICITY GENERATING BOARD\nAmendment\nPassed\nThe amendment was passed by a show of hands and debate began on the amended motion. Opposing the motion Mr. Warren said that he thought that it would set a bad precedent; the supreme\nbody of the Union should be a General Meeting and not a referendum. At a Union meeting the corollaries to a motion can be considered\nas well as the main issue. A Union meeting is not open to coercion from pressure groups or \" the sordid tactics of any student politicians\". Frank Fuchs denied that the precedents set by the motion were bad since the wording of the motion was that the Union meeting instructs the General Committee and establishes\nitself as the supreme body. Summing Up\nIn his summing up Mr. Doe compared the method of a referendum to that of the British elections. He believed it to bet fce fairest method of eliminating pressure groups indie Union meetings. The motion was passed by a show of hands.\nMr. Fuchs spoke again to withdraw the motion he proposed at the end of the previous meeting; this\nmotion dealt with the sending of\ndelegates to theN US conference. He now requested that the President\nwrite to NUS to explain the withdrawal. Emergency\nMeeting\nThe President announced that there\nwould be an Emergency General Committee in the Union office. At this meeting it was decided to hold the referendum on Tuesday6 th. December and that it was to be run on the lines of the Presidential election. The Union would withdraw from NUS immediately so that NUS might not be embarrassed at their conference. The Committee also\ndiscussed the provision of a sheet\nof \"official arguments\" for and against NUS.^3 Si I \u2022 ^r For A Song\nImperial College Dramatic Society\nis presenting ' Penny for a Song',\nby John Whiting this term. The play is uproarious, occasionally verging\non farce, and yet it is based on serious ideas.\nProduced by John Webb( who\nlast year so successfully directed The Fireraisers') the play has an extensive cast which portrays some very colourful characters, Peter Hills, Southside's own traffic warden and Miss Rosemary Seaford are both taking part, and the plot requires\nthe most ambitious staging to be seen at IC for many years.\nWe expect full houses on all four\nnights of the production; at the\ntime of writing( Wednesday 23rd) one third of all tickets have been\nsold( only three days after ticket\nsales began!)

    "content": "FOR THE ATTENTION OF MEMBERo OF R.C.S. UNION.\nWHY R.C.S, ONION SHOULD NOT JOIN H.U.S. The Secretary of N \u2022IT.S \u2022 himself, admitted that N.U.S. is a very good\norganisation for helping the small(700 or less) college without Union facilities, fees or representation on college government.\nI.C.( and hence R.C.S.) is well established, with good Unionf aci li ties, adequate grant( soon to \"be raised, as a result of\nnegotiation by our Union), and with higher than. average representation in college government.\nConsequently the only possible reason for joining IT . U.S. is with regard to major national issues. BUT N.U.S. HAVE FAILED ON MAJOR ISSUES. In the summer of this yearN. TJ.S. sent a letter to all college Presidents saying that\" the Minister of Education was trying to drop loans quietly, and so avoid losing face.\" don't support I.C.'s militant loans lobby. AND YET, 3 M.P,'s have told us that in1968 when the grants are\ndue to be raised, the \u00a320-30 rise will be DEFINITELY in the form of a loan. This is the\" thin end of the wedge\", and N.U.S. HAVE FAILED TO\nSTOP IT. Why should we waste \u00a3180 ( rising to \u00a3360 next year) on a failure? Why should we spend \u00a3160 of the Union's money to send 6 people to discuss petty issues at the 2 conferences? Just because its the country^ s money makes no difference. \u00a3340\n\u00a3520 is still a tremendous waste of money.\nDO WE GET VALUE FOR MONEY?\n9% of I'.C, joined li.U.S. last year, most of them to take advantage\nof the concessions. BUT N.U.S. does not operate a monopoly.\nAll the travel concessions to Etirope can be gained through the German Travel Service, which is FREE and only requires an I.C. Union card. The fares' quoted by G.S.T. S. are often cheaper than N.U.S.'s as\nwell. Independent companies cater for the rest of the world; more\ndetailed information will be published after the referendum. Similarly, most of the shop concessions were offered to N.U.S. by\nthe companies concerned. Consequently noone need feel guilty about using them, and in most instances, if you explain, why you have n't an N.U.S. card, the concessions will be offered to you. The \"Endslexgh Insurance Company and the Entertainments Bureau are both limited companies out to make a profit and So any student can take advantage of them,.\nIf you want legal advice, why consult N.U.S? why not go straight to the source your local Town Hall or the Taxation Office after all that' s what they' re there for. But this is how N.U.S, affects YOU. The main point we are voting on, is whether we AS A UNION'SHOULD JOIN N.U.S. STOP PRESS.\" Times\",28 th November, 1966, page 10\n\" Saturday's conference took all afternoon\" \"to throw out the largely political motion on elections to executive...\" But\" the debate on an educational matter was over within an hour'.'\nPUBLISHED IT R.C.S.

Only a system of higher education which provided 1\na broad spectrum of\ninstitutions with different functions' could prevent the social injustice of the\ndivisions of courses into degree courses and others.\n' It will not improve my relationship with NU3' \u00ab This was his reply to\nthe NUS suggestion-of blacklisting training colleges which run the 'Box and Cox'\nsystem where students spend five weeks at College and five weeks at home alternately.

The official arguments are to be distributed as an insert with FELIX and one will be pinned to each departmental notice board,\nalong with details of the vote.,\nSIR\nSo much has been said about NUS, its concessions and the advantages of being\nrepresented in it that people seem to have forgotten the basic question: Should\nRCS join NUS, Have the gentlemen of RCS forgotten that they are also gentlemen\nof IC. The Union was formed by three colleges so as to strengthen each. Talk\nof RCS, Guilds and Lines and one automatically associates them with internal affairs.

    "content": "FELIX 9\nSOCIAL LIFE As a residential university, ( Jam bridge inevitably absorbs freshmen\nfor three years into a separate way of life with little routine, where working, playing, eating, drinking, talking... are all bound up within the microcosm of Cambridge. The social\nlife is extensive. This is aided by the existence of the University in a small city; entertainment must necessarily be found mainly within the Colleges. The great lack, how ever, is a natural balance between male and female. On Friday and Saturday nights, staircase parties are\nabundant, spewing out guitar sounds\ninto the startled courts and inviting little caravans of undergraduates,\nbearing bottles of wine, but women are too often sparsely scattered.\nFirst year men search eagerly for entertaining women, second years are\nlistless and cynical about the quest-ion while third years often import girl-friends from London and else-where. Cambridge undergrad u et tes are notorious as blue-stockings; although it is unfair to generali se,a large number appear to have struggled to reach the Meccas of\nNewnham and Girton and to have\nlost some of their feminine characteristics on the way. Worse still, how ever, on finding themselves the few among the many, they often take\nlittle care of what femininity they\nhave left \u2014 as one disgruntled male\ncynic has said: T trust the pricks\nthat hurt their pride, when they re enter the natural world, turn t Q stabs of agony'. For the lovelorn under giada at es, however, the lack of\nundergrad ue tte is comp an sated for\nby a large number of secretarial colleges and teacher training colleges,\nin and around the town. WORK\nFor most undergraduates, academic work continues to be based around the weekly tutorials. This is less\ntrue in the sciences where lectures\nplay an important role. A familiar complaint, depending on the lect ur er, is that science lectures degenerate\ninto copying exercises and notes\nmight as well be duplicated and distributed. In general, however,\nlibraries provide the background with the weekly tutorial and essays the focus of work. The variation in the\namount of work1 achieved by stu dents is. vast. While some involve\nthemselves with all that Cambridge has to offer non academically throughout the week, and frantically\npiece together an essay at two in the morning before the next day's tutorial, others fill their lives almost\ncompletely with work. The incidence of mental ill-health at Cambridge is\nextremely high. Whether this is due to the pace of the work or the inherent natures of the undergraduates\nis problematical. EXPANSION\nThe Cambridge undergraduates life\nhas a unique setting. It neither\nexists on a campus, nor is it absorbed within a city community. The town, the Colleges and the University buildings mingle, but around the\nmediaeval centre of the town \u2014\naround the old market square \u2014 many of the shops, pubs and restaurants\nare essentially orientated towards the University; lunches are taken in College pubs; bookshops have the stamp of the University on them: even tobacco shops cater for the\nstudent clientele and gather some-thing of the tradition and feeling ot\nthe University. Like all Britain's universities\nin the post-Robbins era, Cambridge is expanding. The new colleges of\nFitzwilliam and NewHall have been built adding the architectural styles\nof the 1960's to all that has gone\nbefore. This is not radical, however,\nfor Cambridge has always been building. What is oppressive is the expansion of industry and glass\nshopping arcades around the Market Square. Petty C ury has already fal len prey and Christ's College stands\nforlornly lost beside the feverish\nhive of Brad well's Court. The problem is realised, however, by both town and gown and maybe solved\nby the formation of an industrial\ncity centre to release the old centre\nto its quiet growth. Each of Britain's universities in the 1960's has something separate to\noffer. As an old seat of learning, with a wide range of disciplines,\nCambridge has a particular contribution to make. It can be accused\nof an insularity, of a lack of aware ness of the direct necessities that Britain's material wellbeing re quir es. It is however an independent\ncentre of learning and not a tool of\nthe state.\nIf it is possible to sum up Cambridge in one single characteristic that characteristic must be integrity; an integrity of mind which it endeavours to instil in its\ngraduates.\nFELIX thanks ' Varsity' \u2014 The Cambridge University Newspaper \u2014\nfor some of the photographs on these pages.\nOur Temple The Science Museum\nby Tim O 'Brien\nGeograpiucauy toe Mien ce museum and imperial College are\nseparated by a road, many parked can, an ice-cream vs s a and a branch of the General Post Office. Scientifically the separation is\ngreater and much more ominous. The Museum salutes the Gentlemen and Martyrs of the subject, or rather the religion\u2014a metaphor\nto be justified later. Here the struggles and torments of our\n\"Church\" are recreated in the glass-cased shrines; the temple lacks\nonly the incense of sulphur and oil-mist. The pilgrims come and\npress the little buttons to reincarnate the sacred devices of Watt\nand Newcomen, or merely to stand beneath the wings of Bleriot and\nbe surrounded by the engines of Rolls and Royce.\nIn ' The Imperial College of\nScience and Technology', where is\nthis atmosphere ? In this seminary, why is the god not worshipped? There is no fer v our left in the faith ful: there is more interest shown in\nthe nuns of other beliefs than in the\npursuit of truth and self-mortification\nin the laboratory. The lack of faith\nin Britain's scientific seminaries will destroy science. As with other\nreligions where success depends, not\nupon the number of members, but on the dedication of individuals, so\nthe success of science depends not on the number of scientists but on\nthe quality and single-mindedness of\nits sages and novices. The time has\ncome for a Reformation; the age\nthat gave us ph log is ton must be restored.\nA Reformation is needed; but how is this to be inaugurated? Religious\nproblems, whatever the religion may be generalised and parallels may easily be drawn. Christianity as\nevery non Christian and many Christians know is on the decline.\nThe reason for this is obvious. Aska cleric when his faith was at its\ngreatest and he will give you dates\nDetween w n ich persecution was at\nits most intense ad authority most\ntotal. Nothing unites people of like thinking more than a common enemy,\nand nothing consolidates this union more than absolute subjection to\none man or one body of men. Today to its detriment, Christianity is not\npersecuted in this country; hence t ne hierarchy do not exercise control\not tli eir subjects. That element known as free thinking is undermining the\nvery essence of organised religion\nanu, complacency is the result. The remedy is obvious. Persecution and intolerance must be re instigated. Science, as a religion is experiencing tins decline. The symptoms are\npopularity, acceptance of new ideas\non merit alone and belief in the sometimes ridiculous. Science has\nbecome popular, not too popular,\njust popular. Nobody hates scientists\nany more. Responsibility for this\nrests with the doctrine itself. Here we have the only religion which when on trial insists on proving it self correct, and the habit repeated\nover the centuries has led the populace from superstition and in tolerance into an acceptance and general desire to be in on the act.\nConsequently we have the dilution and weakness epi tomis ed by Baxter\nand the World Tomorrow brand of\npopular science. The Chemistry set,\nthat subtle weapon designed to burn little children and hence alienate\ntheir mothers from the Truth, has\nnow become the Teach Yourself\nScience Set and has had all dangerous combinations removed. The result is a system of coloured water and chalk which not only fails to\ninstil a distrust of all things\nscientific but actually encourages the\nchild to scientific ambitions. This phenomenon and others like it serve\nonly to undermine the precept that\nscience must be viewed with suspicion from without for this is\nthe only way to retain the solidarity\nand strength of belief, so necessary.\nThe days have gone when science\nwas deemed heresy,* due perhaps to\nChristian decline as much as\nscientific decline and so it would seem that unless the world becomes\nartist dominated we must wait for Christian revival to provide the persecution necessary.\nThe other two symptoms mention ed, acceptance of new ideas on merit\nalone and belief in the ridiculous\ncan be attributed to a lack of\nauthority, and hence hypocrisy,\nwithin the whole scientific community. The conservatism which made the religion what it is, is fast dis-appearing. The hypocrisy of the past\nis admirably demonstrated in the\nTemple. There, a device known as\nFoucault's Pendulum shows beyond doubt that the earth does not rotate\nbut oscillates gently on an axis\nthrough South Kensington. Thanks to\nthe conservatism of the ancients this\nconcept has been twisted into a proof that the earth does in fact\ngo round. But was Einstein greeted\nwith such sce pt is m? It would ap pear not, as his ideas were actually\nwelcomed as those of a saint. It is\nclear now that he should have been eliminated, as a subversive element\nshould always be eliminated. He dared to question the very roots of\nclassical belief but because thera was no authority remaining to condemn him, he was allowed to continue his activities unhindered. The result was that he not only questioned accepted theory but went so far as to prove it wrong, which has led to the situation we now have in which nobody understands anything. To prevent any reoccur en ce of this\na hierarchy of bigots must be set up; they must pledge themselves to hinder progress as much as possible\nand must have powers of inquisition and Trial by Ordeal at their disposal.\nT ne dedicated scientist must have\nsomething to fight against and so\nprove himself. In this way he will perhaps think twice before he precipitates the rewriting of text-books\nand revolutions of thought which make science today so tiring. A nun Publicity Department must be established which severely restricts\nthe publication of data for the layman. Scientific establishments must\nbe maintained under the utmost\nsecrecy, for only by the employment\nof methods such as these can public distrust and hence hatred make science what it once was.\n\n"

    "content": "6 FELIX COL CUT T Are you a thief?\nIt seems most unfortunate to me that the ' corporate honesty\" of a body should be in inverse proportion to its size. Dishonesty amongst the student\nbody is now a serious and rather alarming feature of IC. Whilst it is\nobvious that the larger the membership of the Union, the greater the\nchance of our having a confirmed kleptomaniac in our midst, this factor\nalone does not account for even a significant proportion of th ie petty d is honesty which pervades this Institution.\nSo far this year there have been three major thefts \u2014 the breaking in to the Southside baggage room and the theft of the two visiting girls' coats\nfrom an attended cloakroom during a Hop. All three could be attributable\nto outside agencies. The Powers That Be accept this as the pleasantest\npossibility and are backing this theory. However attractive the theory is,\nit does not account for the large number of minor thefts that led to the\nremoval of the luggage racks near the lavatory in the Union. The problem appears to be that a very large number of people simply do not regard\ntaking a copy of FELIX and not paying for it as theft. The same is true\nof the newspapers and magazines in the Union lounges. An incredible quantity of glasses have gone from the bars. Cutlery and( heavens know why) trays are stolen in staggering amounts from the refectories. Tools\nregularly go missing from labs, and workshops. A display Ford engine was\nrecently put on display in the Me ch.Eng. Building. Now it has no\ndistributor cap or rotor arm. Every removable part has been removed.\nOne wonders what state the Department's new rocket engine will be in by the end of term. What is the difference, except in scale, between\nstealing a car and stealing a glass from the bar? The simple truth of\nthe matter is that it is still theft, still dishonest and costing both the\nUnion and the College a large amount of money. Of course, this doesn't apply to you, you've only got one set ot Mooney cutlery, or one 01 Stan's pint mags, au U so has the broke next door, so why shouldn't you? Simply oe cause t ney are not your property and you are at niet if you take the m,ii oom searches were seriously considered last year but not earned out as\nthey were thought an infringement of student freedom, something prized very highly here. Unfortunately petty thieving has reached such a state\nthat there is a strong argument for the College Authorities saying:\" Freedom? \u2014 but look what you do with it.\" RCS SMOKING CONCERT The \u00a372000 bill\nthe telephone scandal is an obvious example of this attitude towards\nsomeone else's property, when someone else is a large institution. It is\ndishonest to make a local call over a College 'phone without paying for\nit if it is a private call. Everyone is aghast at the nerve of the gentle-man with t lie Norwegian girlfriend, but have you used a college phone for your own purposes t Whilst on the subject of the telephone business, enough of which is\nsaid elsewhere, it is interesting to note th nt the late Rector said, in the\nObserver colour supplement published at the beginning of this term, that\none of the major advantages of having the College in the centre of\nLondon was that: \"It's the di ile rence between a trunk call and a local call.\" Yes, indeed!

His antics were, however, interspersed by numerous sketches,\nsome very good, some good and some ruined by members of the\naudience shouting out the punch line. Most of the sketches were well received, deservedly, and audience\nparticipation increased as the even-ing progressed.\nThe best sketch, judged by a method which appeared to have no\nrelevance to anything, was the\n\"Sociology Class\".

Mr. Berne, a U.S. Labour at tad he, in speaking\nof the immense power and resources of the American Trades Unions, pointed out that they can only interfere once a change in a contract\nhas been made. A contract, he said, is a legal, binding document, not to be broken by either side without financial loss; but unfortunately most\ncontracts involve clauses allowing these contracts to be, if not broken, at least changed. Once the management has taken this step, the Union is ma position to show its strength.\nMr. Berne cited the example of the American Railway1 Union, which recently spent upwards of600,000 dol lars in collecting lawyers, material\nand general information over a sacking s case. . This, he said, was money well spent, since in the negotiations that followed the Union knew demonstrably more than the management itself about the manage-ment's railways; and was thus able\nto win the case. Such super po wei techniques are b v no means used only to aid this e unfairly dismissed; last\nyear in negotiations for pens v/ ns,\nthe Unions managed to squeeze a total of 2.5 billion dollars worth of\npensions and social services o\\'t ot\nthe ti opponents.\nMr. Be me finished by introducing the title t ne me of his lecture. \" Is Automation a Blessing or a Curse?\" he asked. In answering the question\nhe said that the American unions\naccept automation because it means\nlonger holidays and bigger pay pack ets; but the problem of leisure time remains as yet unsolved. No union leader wanted to spend hours\nnegotiating to give his colle a goes more\nand more time in front of the tele-vision, Mr. Be me concluded. Foreign\nbodies\nby D.I.

However, what he did really think was never established. Young Liberals leader Terry Lacey, in the phrase of an onlooker, made the meeting more like a party political broadcast*.\nDespite acclamation s afterwards in the bar by both Martin and Hunt that they had won the meeting over\nto their side, the general convictions\nwere that NUS had at least one overrated member of the Executive and that RSA was a nonentity.\nConcourse DONS TALK ON MENTAL HEALTH Cambridge dons are discussing far-reaching plans to improvement al health facilities for students.\nThe university is presently largely dependent on an overworked unit \u2022run as a special service at NHS expense. If the tin ivers it y wis.ies la expand services it will have to be at its own expense.\nBeing discussed now are two suggestions. First, to expand the present\nunit to deal purely with mental health.

    "content": "RCS OUTVote to withdraw from NUS challenged by C.G. Harrison\nLoad and prolonged applause followed the proposal speech by\nML J. Lack at the RCS Meeting last Tuesday. Though the speeches succeeding it put the many different aspects of die case for and\nagainst NUS the result was predictable. Mr. Lack's motion, which\nwas carried, was in fact a negation of the one passed only two\nweeks before instructing RCS Committee to apply for membership\nof NUS. The speeches from the floor occupied almost all of the\none-and-a quarter hours available and the meeting voted to adjourn until the following Thursday.\nThe meeting was opened by President Keith Cavanagh to a full,\nthough not packed house. Having completed the signing of the\nminutes he produced a letter from the Dept. of Education and\nScience (which had been questioned by the Union) regarding the\npayment of NUS fees by local Education Authorities. The writer\nclaimed to be not entirely clear on the matter but stated that by\naffiliating to NUS, RCS could claim to be providing a new service.\nAn increase in the Union fee due to this is permissible and would\nbe paid by the LEA. Vice-President Dick Conn explained to the Union the RCS plans for\ncollecting money for the Carnival\nCharity which included the ChelseaReal Madrid match and a blockade\nof the City on the following Friday.\nHe appealed for entrants and\nspectators for the Swimming Gala on\nFriday 2nd. December. Cavanagh\nthen proposed, to amend the age nd? so that Lack's motion could be debated first, since this could save\ntime.\nMartin Lack opened his speech by refusing the \"carrots\" with which\nRCS had been tempted at the last\nmeeting.\nBy his own mitigation s he had\ndiscovered that NUS has no monopoly of the benefits it offers its\nmembers. Anyone can make use of\nthe Entertainments service, or of\nEndsleigh Insurance\u2014the new NUS insurance bureau. How would joining benefit RC S?He pointed out\nthat there,, are several other firms\noffering cut-price travel\u2014some of\nthem cheaper than NUS. Would NUS be of use in national\naffairs ? Mr. Lack pointed out that\nwhen IC Union organised the Loans\nlobby of Parliament, NUS attempted\nto dissuade them saying that they\nbelieved the Ministry of Education\nwould drop it. Since then it has\nbeen stated that it may well be\nintroduced in 1968.\nMr. Lack had spoken to the\nSecretary of NUS and put it to him\nthat bit organisation really only served colleges whose membership was\nless than seven hundred. The Secretary agreed on this point. RCS however had excellent facilities and\nexcellent representation on College\ncommittees. In fact, he said, the.\nonly situation in winch RCS Unionwould need NUS is one concerning a national issue\u2014and here NUS fails.\nThe motion was opposed by Paul\nFawcett who claimed that recently\nRCS had been too insular, that its\nmembers were forgetting that they\nwere also members of the student\nbody of tii e country. There was a kind of pride in not being a member of NU S.He stated the aims of\nthe National Union of Students as\nlaye d out in 1947. In the past NUS had obtained grant increases and\nprevented an increase in the Hall\not Residence fees, and although NUS was not always completely successful\nin its dealings with the Government,\nhe thought that R CSU was allowing\nit to step in and save money for\nits students without doing anything\nto help NUS. Mr. Fawcett displayed several\nNUS pamphlets; he explained that\n. \u2022 0\n^ I ft\nPresident Cavanagh addresses the\nUnion meeting on Tuesday.\nPhoto by Mike Yu. it published about a dozen of these\neach year to deal with specific\nstudent problems. To contribute the\nknowledge possessed by R CSU as\na technological institution, the Union\nneeded to join NUS. The Union had\nin fact an obligation to join in order\nto share its scientific experience. It\nneeded to join in order that NUS might consider problems which\nneeded putting to the Government\non its behalf.\nA short and rather ineffective\nspeech was made by the second er for the proposition. He stated, without evidence, that this year NUS has done nothing and asked if the\nUnion would waste money by joining\nsuch a body.\nThe second speaker in opposition\ndescribed the comprehensive studies\nmade by NUS on student problems.\nThese were made by consulting\nevery college\u2014a method that could\nnot be used by R CSU or ICU. As for finance\u2014if the money was to\ncome from LEA, then R CSU would\nnot lose anything and by joining\nWould gain a voice on NUS Council.\nThis would be of importance in\ntechnological issues.\nFloor Speeches\nSpeeches were then invited for\nand against the motion. Several\ninteresting items were brought out\nand many points of order raised in\na heated debate. The case of RCS was compared to that of the\nUniversity of Keele, which is of a similar size. Keele had complained\nthat it was not given a say because\nof the system of voting used.\nAs a non-political body NUS has\nrefused to take up the Prices and\nIncomes Standstill with the Government, yet it is a member of the\nInternational Students Conference\u2014\na highly political body. It was, how-ever, unable to vote on 95p.c. of the\nmotions.\nOne simple yet important point\nwas raised by M.J. Tait who questioned RCS Union joining NUS, since\nsurely IC Union should deal with\nmatters outside the College. This\nwas well received.\nPaul Fawcett summed up for the\nopposition, saying that NUS did obtain concessions for students and that\nthese would be available for the use\nof the Union, NUS can give advice\nand legal aid where necessary. Mr. Fawcett finished by saying that R CSU needs NUS and needs R CSU. In his summing up Martin Lack\nquoted a figure obtained recently\nby inspecting NUS files. He had\nfound that only 9p.c. of ICU are\nmembers of NU S,i.e.330 out of\n3500. He pointed out its inability\nto deal with important national issues and that its services were in general, duplicated by other organisations or available to all students.\nBallot\nA paper ballot was taken and\nwhilst these were counted the\nPresident passed on to Any Other\nBusiness. As it was nearly 2.30 p.m. many members left after the ballot\nand when Mr. Fuchs challenged the\nvote it was decided that it was not\npracticable to hold another ballot.\nThe final figures, after a recount,\nwere For:163; Against: 143 and\n1 abstention.\nMr. fu ens pointed out. t natt ne application to iN US had been made\nau u a wit noi a wai could only follow\nan rv oSU Committee meeting. He suggested tn at six visitors should be\ns enc to the Margate conference on\nfriday to explain why R CSU had been withdrawn, but this was not\nruled on by Cavanagh..\nAd jo urn ment In view of the time and the fact\nthat Mr. Tim Doe's motion, regarding a referendum, was still to be\ndebated, it was decided to adjourn\nthe meeting until Thursday 24th. The meeting adjourned with a Kangela..\n\n"

However, two matches have been played, and the results ate quite encouraging \u2014 LC. beat London Hospital5\\ i matches,\non9 th November, and the College of Estate Management3 j2 \u00b1 , on16 th November.

QUICKLY got on top in the game bet wen the seconds and U.C., \u2014 in fact the score was two nil, and U.C. saw little of the IC goal. As it was rather a cold day E. Have s, in the college goal, started to feel a little chilly. There are ways to\novercome this affliction, one of these\nbeing a few 'chin ups' on the cross-bar. This proved the turning point\nof the game \u2014 i he start ot .I.C.'s tall. It is asad thing that cross bars\nsometimes break when so loaded,\nand this was not Eric' s day. The next thing he remembers after leaping gracefully to the bar is lying in a prone position, surrounded by pieces of wood. Unfortunately, U.C. were not carrying a spare with them, and the game had to be abandoned.\nThis seems to prove that ill winds are also rather cold winds \u2014 perhaps wood is brittle at such temperatures.\nIC Rifle Club\nwin convincingly\nThe Riffle Club took a team of\neight people to shoot against\nChichester Rifle Club on Sunday20 th November.

Our usual\ndepleted team appeared but as most people competed in two or\neven three events, relay teams were made up and the requirement\nof two competitors per field event was fulfilled (the results of field\nevents depend on the aggregate of the two). We won two of the\njumps\u2014the triple through Paul Jones and Chris Power and the\nhigh with Mike Evans and captain Maicess Weaver who had lost\nthe opposition by the time they reached 5\" 8\".\nSome expected points were lost as Dave Down ie was unable to reach\nMot spur Park before the pole vault was over. In the throwing events\ncharacterised as usual by the absence of those to whom the Rugby Club is *he greater attraction, on one man team of mighty Geoff Ever it t, aided by some of our jumpers, managed to score more points than expected and helped to give us a reasonable total and a comfortable second places\u2014\nunder the circumstances a worthy result. Poor changeovers in the4 x110 yard relay (a result of the team being decided only minutes before the\nrac f) cost us the relays cup; had oui baton-passing been better we could have beaten UC and won by one point. However, we were third, the\nwinners being a strong team from Guy's Hospital who also won convincingly in the220,220,440 relay where again UC were second and we were\nthird. However, thanks to the cross country club, who loaned us some\nof their members, we won the 4 4 0 , 8 8 0 , mile race. Fresher Alan Mon at gave us a lead on the first leg, which was maintained by Dave Dallman until the end of his second lap when he was passed by Clayton of UC. It was regained soon after the changeover, by our Welsh Mile Champion Nick Part on, who kept his 1 0 yard lead over the UC runner and strode\nround to give us victory.\nIt w?s nt really a disappointing afternoon for the College, only a little\ndisheartening when we could have done better. On the previous Saturday\nthere was the second league match of the season and once again it was the faithful few who turned out to uphold IC's name.\nSuccessful field events\nDerek Wade and Chris Fo wer repeated then: previous successes in the\nlong and triple jumps respectively but Mike Evans wasn't so lucky in the high jump. Although he cleared six feet for only the third time since\nhe came to College( but still below his best) he was only second, being beaten by guest\" competitor Richard Morris \u2014 one of the best high jumpers\niiS the country. The surprise of the morning was in the pole vault, won by Dave Down ie who in his first bout of athletic activity since the tour\nof Germany in the summer, and his first ever appearance during the winter managed to get over nine feet.\nThe outstanding IC track competitor was again Richard Beck \u2014 the220 and440 arc now virtually two man races between him and Pete Kristal, an American fresher at UC. This time Richard was second in both, but his time for the quarter of 50.9 after a poor start (Kristal did50.7) is\nexcellent for the time of year. Jan Win ship neared his best with a10.5 for a third place in. the100 yards and Dave Dallman ran well for a third Ul trie 8 8 0 . A paucity of throwers (one to be precise) didn't help us to\nachieve much success in the remaining events.\nIf a lesson was learnt from the meeting it was that those who have\nbeen training reasonably frequently have been reaping the rewards, to some extent already, and I would again urge those who want to achieve\nsomething athletically next summer to do some training this winter. \u00ab Metropolitan\nWater Board\nENGINEERING UNDERGRADUATES\nrequired as Engineering Assistants\n(SALARY SCALE \u00a31,020 (at age 21>\u00a31,620 per\nannum).\nOpportunities are offered to graduates seeking the\ntraining and experience necessary for corporate\nmembership of the appropriate professional institution\nand a career in\nCIVIL ENGINEERING\nor\nMECHANICAL ENGINEERING\nor\nELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.\nIf you expect to graduate next summer and seek\nemployment thereafter write NOW for full particulars\n(quoting ref.

Should RCS Union work for its members welfare? A. Well, that' s what our constitution says, In fact there' s been\nprecious little done since about 1950. However, wa seem tro have got\nrestarted recently; academic subcommittees, safety in labs, housing' and so on.\nQ. Could NUS help us on these problems?\nA. Some of these, and others like course content, grants, etc. are\nnational problems. Q. So?\nA. Well, there' s the point about advice and help based on nationwide experience. Also, the Minister of Education has made it clear that he\nregards NUS as the national stu dont voice. The Association of University Teachers and the Committee of Vice Chancellors both have very close national cont?,ct with NUS and listen to what it says if backed by\nevidence. Q. And you think that we can provide this evidence? A. We could certainly say more about science education, and postgraduate education than any other college in the country. Q. Why- don't they come to us direct then?\nA. Because they want to have a balanced national picture. Q. What about loans? A. A good point. While we went on one single lobby( a jolly good effort mind you) NUS were arranging for the N.U.I., the A.T.. T.I., the A.S c.W. the A.U.T. and finally, the Trades Union Congress as a whole to\noppose loans. This weekend at their council they are discussing further long term action ready to last years if needed.\nQ. Has NUS ever done anything for us?\nA. Just recently, when hall fees were going up (by about seven quid at this college) NUS got on to the Minister and got him to agree to apply the Price Freeze so that they didn't go up. And the last grant rise Was negotiated by NUS.\nQ. But NUS don't get everything they ask for, surely? A. Of course not nor does any pressure group i But they keep on\npressing and when they have a good case they win. Anyway no-one else is asking on our behalf.' Q. Do they get anything for individual members?\nA. NUS handles about seven cases every day of students whose grants are late. It intervenes in discipline cases its fighting one through the courts now. And of course there' s the concessions and cheap travel. Q. Wheat's NUS up to right now?\nA. It's working on - wait till I take a breath National Insurance, Student housing, safety in labs, the means test, womens education, implementation of the Robbins report... and on and on.\nQ. Well, why the hell dont we get in there? A. Why ask me? I'm no know all J PUBLISHED BY R.C.S. UNION\nrn iT17 pAT.T. OT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MEMBERS OF R.C.S. UNION WISH TO\nJOIN NTs. WILL BE HELD ON TUESDAY, 6 th DECEMBER. FURTHER DETAILS\nWILL BE POSTED ON NOTICEBOARDS SHORTLY.\n\n"

Church House, Westminster\nwill be turned into s scene of intense\n'diplomatic' activities from 29 March\nto 1 April, 1967 when more than\n400 students from all over the\ncountry will for a time change their\nnationality to Cambodian or Mongolian,..\nAfter the overwhelming success of\nthe first two Assemblies\u2014the only\nones of their kind in Europe\u2014held\nin Cambridge in1964 and Oxford in1965 London agreed to play host to\nthe third one and to turn it into a major event in the national student\ncalender.\nThe Assembly is organised by the\nUnified Student Association of the\nUnited Kingdom which is a national\nstudent organisation with 10,000\nmembers. A branch of the Association\nexists in most universities and colleges in the country. Imperial College Interational Relations Club is\none such and a very active one \u00ab t that. The3 member Steering Committee set up by the National Executive of UNS A consists of Imperial College, L.S.E. and U.L. U. and\nhas 'been working since January this\nyear to organise the Model Assembly.\nAll member states of the United\nNations (121 all the latest count)\nwill be represented by groups of\ntour students from colleges and\nuniversities throughout the country.\nThree Resolutions\nWherever possible the 'delegates'\nwill not come from the countries\nthey intend to represent, because\notherwise the process of learning\nabout that particular country will be\nlost However, each delegation is\nencouraged to have at least one\n'adviser' from the country they re present to help on difficult matters.\nArtist and\nCamera\nA be emergence of photography in the nineteenth century brought\nabout a great change in the way in wh i cn painters looked at the world.\nXtae ln nu en ce of photography on art,\nand vice versa, was discussed by Mr. J. L. Fagg A. K.P. S, at a joint meeting of the photographic societies of\nChelsea College, the College of St. Mark and St. John, Queen Elizabeth's College and I in p sri*! College in conjunction with ti iei'. C. Art Club. Photography was initially used as\na means of making pictures quickly \u2014 it was un sui ii assed in portraiture\ntor example, ai;d painters were happy to be relieved uf this often painful chore. By its very nature, how ever, the camera imposed its own character on the pictures it made,\nand soon escaped from the purely \"compositional' attitudes of the\ntraditional artist. Photographers realised that here was a tool which could stop life in its tracks and capture a moment of action, a feeling or an expression. And this, of\ncourse, had its influence on the paint ers of the period \u2014 some of Degas' ballet pictures show the\" blur\" characteristic of a photograph at a slow shutter speed. We know for a fact that Degas, Bonnard and others were friendly with many photographers in France and were\nactively interested themselves in this\nnew art form.\nN. Shandler\nAfter a general debate on the wo rio situation three resolutions on specific\ntopics will be discussed. These are:a) The situation in South-East\nAsia,\nb) Economic Development,\nc) Disarmament and Peace-keening.\nThe last afternoon will be spent on\ndiscussing emergency resolutions.\nQuite apart from the educational\naspect of the Assembly\u2014the complexities of international diplomacy,\nwork of the U.N. and the rest of\nit\u2014it is also a great social occ as sion where so many students from all\nparts of the country Bather\u2014an opportunity hardly available otherwise.\nExhibition\nIn addition there will be arai j or u ie eu ug on u ie eve ot tue ot nv if c' opening in which the Foreign\nSecretary \\y ill address the delegates.\nAn exhibition of books on international Affairs will be run by a group of publishers and a folk concert will be held at the Lyceum Ballroom.\nAll these point to an exciting\nstudent occ as sion in London in the\nSpring. Imperial College will represent 5 countries in the Assembly.\nAnyone interested to go as delegate\nis asked to contact Nitin Som (Intern-al 3288 or Keogh 385) or to come\nto a Thursday meeting of the International Relations Club where all\ndetails will be avail a be.

Neither of these two\nhackneyed aspects are Cambridge, they are but part of a complex\nwhole.\nThe centre of Cambridge has a unique character\u2014an intricate\nmicrocosm filled with activity but overlaid with a sense of time-less ness. A composition of two factors produces this atmosphere\u2014\nthe vast arid often haphazard array of architectural styles and\nperiods which join to form the Colleges and streets, and the ever-present undergraduates\u2014individuals who are undoubtedly university\nstudents\u2014stamped in an indefinable way so that they could be no\nother type of person.\nINDIVIDUALS and\nORGANISATION\nThe undergraduate cross-section\nis surprisingly amorphous: donkey\njackets and jeans rub shoulders un ABOVE: \"Aged dons seemingly\nfrozen into the architecture\"\nLEFT: Soft, silent courts\ncomfortably with tweed suits; \"grey\nmen' eat in Hall near a drama\ncrowd celebrating their extroversion;\nbeer swilling rugby players pass by searching intellectuals; corduroy-jacketed earnest would-be politicians\nliv f next to hedonistic philanderers.\nCliques inevitably form, live different lives and gain different things.\nThe amorphous nature of the student body and, the formation of\ncliques detracts' from a composite\nstudent opinion. In contrast to most\nother English Universities, Cambridge\ndoes not have a powerful student\nunion to coalesce opinion and to\nvent that opinion. The Cambridge\nUnion is a society, provides a forum\nfor debate, and is not a democratic\nexecutive body for the whole univers-it y. Recently a student's representative council has been formed, but\nas yet has little influence and is\ntreated with disinterest by the\nmajority of students. Each College\nhas a Junior Common Room Committee wh icE again arouses little interest and mainly con.ern s itself\nwith ineffectively trying to improve\nthe quality of food in its College Hall. The lack of a strong\ncentral student government might\nseem surprising to students elsewhere;\nit is due however to the existence\nof separate cliques, and to the Colleges which fragment a university\nconsensus. There is a, further reason\narising from the Cambridge undergraduate mentality. Perhaps because\nof a reaction from the authoritarian*\nism of school, and a reaction from\npedantry, there exists a cynicism towards pompous bodies, committees,\nsecretaries, presidents and all the\nrest of the paraphernalia of organ is ation. They are accepted but not\nelevated and in the general run of\nundergraduate life play little part.\n\n"

Henry, Chief Security Officer of the College, However, although the level of\nthefts remains high, it has not risen\nover the last few years.\nMr. Henry lays the blame for th a high rate of thefts squarely 00 the\nstudents; the laxity with which they\ntake care of their per con?) rw sessions provides the opportunity fir thefts to occur. Wallets containing large sums of money are kit casually in mo hung on racks;\njackets and briefcases are left lying unattended next to doors and in corridors.

There exist facilities in all\nbuildings for \"banking' coats, hats,\numbrellas and briefcases.

Potter\nY HA Group in\nPeak District\nThe Peak District National Park\nlies south of a line drawn between\nSheffield and Manchester, but its\ndissimilarity from these cities is com-ple te, as IC-Bedford Youth Hostel\ngroup discovered over the weekend\nll-13th November.\nAfter travelling up by coach the\ngroup of almost forty went on\nmodest hiking tours of parts of the\narea in three groups. The countryside is mainly open moorland, with\na few towns of some size, but\nmostly scattered villages and small\ntowns, often with factories.\nThe weather is generally overcast\nand can be misty, over a landscape\nof grey stone walls and some wooded valleys.\nAmong other places, we saw\nCastleton, with the ruined Peveril\nCastle standing high above it, and\nthe Ladybower Reservoir. The\ncoach and hostel were subjected to\nprolonged sing-songs. We look forward to coming weekend trips to\nYorshire and the Lake District.\nJ. W. Aldam\nBeer Prices Increase?\nBeer prices in the Union may have to be increased. That was\none ef the conclusions reached by the Refectory Committee at their\nfirst meeting this session. Despite last year's profit of \u00a3780,\nbecause of price rises by the brewers, which have not been passed\non, and because of the employment of two extra barmen, the bar\nwill make a considerable loss this year unless drink prices are\nput up.\nThis price increase was actually\nagreed last session, but because of\ndoubts whether it fell within the\nPrices and Incomes standstill, it was\nnot put into effect. It is now considered that because an increase\nwould be due to increases by the\nsuppliers, the freeze has no effect.\nHowever, because of the unpopularity of this move, the Committee decided after discussion that the\nposition should be investigated\nfurther and the increase only implemented if there is no other method\nof avoiding a loss on the bars. Th e probable increases would be 2da pint on draught beer, and Id a pint\non bottled beer.\nAccounts\nHie main recommendation of the\nCatering Sub-Committee in their report was the speeding-up of ti he addition of snack-bar facilities to\nthe main dining-hall, it was thought\ndesirable that the change shou l cfc be\nmade much sooner. The installation\nof movable counters and necessary\nequipment will cost about \u00a3 1 7 5 , and\nthe alteration will be treated\ninitially as an experiment.\nThe Refectory Committee were\nwell satisfied with the Catering accounts which showed a loss of only\n\u00a3 1 6 3 on a turnover of nearly\n\u00a3166,000 despite price increases in\nfood which were not passed on, and\ncongratulated Mr. Mooney on his\nefforts.\nThe Wine Committee reported increase in consumption of vintage\nwines from reserve stock, and so\ndecided to continue its policy of\npurchasing good vintages. It also\nreported that after a visit from the\nWeights and Measures Deparment,\nit was agreed that the College Bars\ndid not fall within the Acts, thus\navoiding the considerable cost of\ngetting glasses approved by the\nauthorities. On the subject of glas-ses, it was reported that breakages\nand loss of glasses from the College\nbars, so far this term, had cost\nabout \u00a3 1 5 0 .\nThe main item to be set against\nthe Refectory Reserve Account,\nwhich now has a balance of just\nover \u00a37.000. is the cost of the\nCrush-hall Bar, which is nearly\n\u00a31,300. It was also agreed that\n\u00a3 2 0 0 shou lH be spent from the Reserve Account on purchasing extra\nplaces of silver, and that 3 more\ncandelabra should be bought, one oi\nwhich would de place the candelabra\nthat Mr. Mooney lost to Metallurgy\nabout two years ago- Two new coffee machines have also been purchased for the Union, at a maximum\ncost of about \u00a3 7 5 . Complaints about\nthe quality of the coffee from older\nmachines are being investigated.\nComplaints officers have also been\nappointed, and these are Mr. R. Lewis for South Side and Mr. D.
