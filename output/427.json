It's purpose would be to co-ordinate the\nactivities of the numerous national\nsocieties within the Union and it would\nalso provide a forum for promoting\nmulti-national social events and culture\ndisplays. I would stress that this is only a tentative suggestion and comments as to\nit's potential viability would be\nappreciated.\nAlso, we are greatly in need of\nvolunteers to man an information desk for\nOverseas Students in the Sherfield\nBuilding entrance hall. The more\nPRACTICAL\nRABBIT\nby IC Union Hon. Sec.\nChalky White\nAfore I begin, welcome to the new look\nIC Union. All the old cobwebs have been\nblown out and we are currently installing\nour own! Nick's busy initiating policy, Derrick's busy decorating and I'm busy, so\ndon't disturb me....unless of course you\nwant even the tiniest little thing, when\nI shall be only to happy to help out.\nWho am I? Oh yes....me....we lI I'm your Union's Secretary for next year,\ninitiall.y accorded the tag John White,\nnow invariably I answer to Chalky.\nIn my opinion, this Post Graduate\nissue i of FELIX demands a certain kind of\nflavour, not to put too fine a point on it\nRELEVANCE. Therefore, we hit the road\nwith a few topics which I hope will be\nrelevant to YOU, the Post Graduate.\nInsurance\nHere are some general points which\nhave recently been clarified by End sleigh Insurance and Mr Fred Annas, the College Accountant.\nTo quote End sleigh:\"... full time post graduate students\nare covered by the Group Personal\nAccident Insurance Policy24 hours a day during term time and whilst taking\npart in College or Union activities during\nvacations....\" There used to be some misapprehension\nabout aPG' s insurance situation while\nPRES\nCUTTINGS\nby IC Union President\nNick Brayshaw\nvolunteers we get, trie less time each\nperson would be required but if you were\nable to offer a couple of hours a week to\ntell incoming Overseas Students general\n(local) information it would be greatly\nappreciated.\nInterested \u2014 please phone me in the\nUnion (int. 3915) or Mr WS Robertson,\nSherfield Building( int. 3951) as soon as\npossible.\nLadies Lavatories\nFollowing the most regrettable events\nwhich have occurred in the Union Ladies demonstrating to undergraduates. This was specifically around an area involving\nthe cover of the policy taking into\naccount that the PG' s were being paid to\ndemonstrate.\nTo clear up this situation I quote\nEnd sleigh yet again:\n\" . . . . this cover (the Group Personal\nAccident Insurance Policy) would include\ndemonstrating performed for the benefit of\nundergraduate students. The fact that the\npost graduate students are paid for\nproviding these demonstrations has no\nbearing on this insurance.\" Further to this, Mr Annas informs me\nthat \" aPG, if sued by another student\nwhen carrying out his duties as a demonstrator for injuries received through\nnegligence, is protected under the\nCollege's Liability Policy.\" My thanks go to Mr Fred Annas for\nproviding all this information.\nParking\nDuring the Summer Vacation, what\nlittle of it there is left, the parking of\ncars by students within the College grounds is under the wing of Mr Ted\nFisher, Traffic Controller, Imperial\nInstitute Road. If you wish to park in\nthe College grounds go and see Mr Fisher( hut at the entrance of Imperial Institute\nRoad). He will take down the necessary\ndetails of your vehicle and, provided\nspace is available, give you the ok.\nWhen term starts the Parking Permit\nScheme will be in operation as usual. Application forms for Parking Permits are\nnow available from the Union Office,( note - these forms are for UG and PG students only). They must be returned to\nthe Union Office by THURSDAY 7th OCTOBER. The IC Union Parking\nCommittee will meet that weekend and a list of successful applicants will be\npublished in the following Friday's FELIX. I would take this opportunity to\nwarn you not to expect to get a permit\nsimply because you have applied and\nYOU believe that your reasons are\nsufficiently strong to warrant the issue\nof a permit. IC UNION RECEIVES\nOVER 800 APPLICATIONS FOR 200\nLoo over the past year, the buildings\nsection have been active in trying to make\nthe area safe for those girls who use\nthese facilities. The measures being\ntaken include leaving the staircase lights\non all the time (by means of locks on the\nswitches), putting frosted glass on the\ndoors, and installing a number of bell pushes connected to prominent positions\nin the Union and college. I cannot over\nemphasize the gravity of the situation and\nhope that all members of the college will treat these installations with the respect\nthey deserve.\nPhotographic Booth\nWe are currently involved in negotiations\nwith a supplier of photographic booths\nwith a view to installing one of their\nmachines in the Union Building. The\ncurrent state of affairs is that a machine\nwill be installed soon, and will be placed\nin the main entrance to the Union Building\n(by the entrance to the Ref e c).All being\nwell, the machine will produce four\nglorious black-and-white photographs for\na nominal sum, which will be suitable for\ncollege registration cards, NUS cards,\nBritish Rail cards, passports etc. The\ninstallation of this machine is conditional\nupon:-(i) Sufficient trade being generated to\nviable proposition.\n(ii) No serious damage or vandalism\noccurring to the machine. You\nhave been warned!\nNick Brayshaw\nPERMITS EVERY YEAR! The selection committee has firm guidelines as to its\nselection policy and these will be\nadhered to. Please note that within the\nCollege grounds, once the scheme has\ncommenced, THE PARKING OF VEHICLES\nNOT DISPLAYING PARKING PERMITS\nIS PROHIBITED.\nProvision is also made for the parking\nof motorcycles and scooters in special areas distributed throughout the College grounds. It is not necessary for motor-cycles or scooters to display permit\nlabels of any kind but the registration\nnumbers of all machines must be notified\nto the Security Office (165, Sherfield\nBuilding) at least 48 hours before a machine is first brought into the College grounds.\nFlat-hunting\nIt you are looking for a flat or will be\nbefore the start of term, I have prepared a \"rough guide\" to the 'game'. Included\nin this literary masterpiece is: general\nadvice, lists of accommodation agencies and estate agents relatively near at\nhand, a British Council list of agencies,\naUL Accommodation Bureau list of\nagencies and also photocopies of the\nsections \"Accommodation Agencies\" and\n\" Estate Agents\" from the Yellow Pages (central).\nIf you would like a copy, there are\nsome in the Union Office. The FLATSHARE scheme starts on\nSat 18th September, so if you're looking\nfor a flat or want to fill a vacancy in your\nflat the Union Office is where it's all at.\nThe scheme runs till the 25th September.\nHours of business?10 am to 5pm. To finish off this PG orientated\narticle I would just ask you to support\nyour Post Graduate Affairs Officer,\nRick Parker. With Rick at the helm the\nPost Graduates' lot can be put into\nperspective for all to see but, and it's a big 'but', he needs your support and\ndirection in order to be representative\nof your views. Bye for now, see you around and take\ncare.\nChalky "

    "content": "FELIX, SEPTEMBER17 th19767 Have you ever become dissatisfied with well known writers churning out the stuff week in week out. D Clark son has.\nHere he sets out to copy the style of M. Parkinson on Cricket.\nGlarkson on Parkinson on Cricket\nAS I watched the procession of weary\nEngland batsmen wending their way back\nto the pavilion on the second afternoon of\nthe recent Test Match, I was reminded of\na similar procession which takes place\nevery evening as the day-shift trudge out\nof the mill in Bam s ley. There are men\nin that mill, however, who unlike the\npresent England team, could tell you a thing or two about cricket. In fact, come\nto think of it, my aunt Bertha could tell\nyou more about cricket than most\nprofessional cricketers bron south of\nthe Humber.\nLord Pongo Toffs XI\nThere' s one particular game that Is hall always treasure, from the summer\nof 1903. It was the great event of the\nyear, when Batley Mill played Lord' Pongo' Clark-Smythe's Toffs XI. Lord Clark-Smythe, who owned the mill\nand most of our houses, was a town\ncouncillor and president of the golf club,\nthe conservative association and a life\nmember of the M CC. It is in absolutely\nno way whatsoever an exaggeration to\nview this annual fixture as the entire\n\" Autumn's here!\" came the cry as the\nChristmas cards ousted the suntan lotion\nfrom. the shops. It's time to turn our\nminds away from the drought and ways\nof producing refreshing summer drinks\nfrom old bath water, towards the impending\nacademic year and all that it has in\nstore.\nThe new year will bring with it a new\nlevel of grant (\u00a31380) for most of us,\nwhich should put us back on friendly\nterms with our bank managers, at least\nfor a few weeks. If Mr Callaghan and his\nshiny new cabinet can keep inflation\ndeflated, we may even last a little\nlonger.\nFor those in need of financial aid there\nis always the refreshing thought that\ndemonstrating rates will be going up.\nThe Committee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals( CVC P) is likely to recommend\na minimum rate of around \u00a32.20 / hour.\nThe Association of University Teachers\nwill be pressing for a rate of \u00a32.90 and\nthe NUS will be topping the table by\npressing for \u00a33.00 / hour. We can only\nhope that the NUS will be successful in\nputting their case for our hardship.\n(National Union of Students not Seamen \u2014\nthe former don't seem to have quite the\nstranglehold on the economy that the\nlatter do). Two years ago the College paid a rate of \u00a32.00 and at that time\nthe first CVC P minimum was set at \u00a31.50.\nOne year later the CVC P rate rose by a staggering 40% to \u00a32.10 and we leapt up\nan ear ht shattering5% to \u00a32.10. I do not\nbelieve that we should get more than the\nCVC P recommendation, but we must\npress for this to be a reasonable amount.\nAway from high finance to another\ncloudy vision from my crystal ball. The\nCollege Postgraduate Working Party is\nabout to make known its findings.Amongst\nthe recommendations is likely to be the\nsetting up of committees at both college\nand department level to look into and\nafter all aspects of Graduate Studies at\nIC. The department committees, apart\nfrom providing hours of enjoyment for\nuniversal struggle in microcosm; as Us\nagainst Them; the people against the\nidle rich; exploited against exploiters; or,\nin short, right against wrong; good\nagainst evil. Our groundsman, 108 year old Bill Grit ( still as tough now as when, a mere\nschoolboy, he hooked the legendary\n'Speedy' Sam Strong for six, forward of\nsquare) had prepared atypical mill wicket. This meant that the Toffs, being\nused to playing only on billiard tables, had\nno chance.\nSpilt ale and unsuspecting worms\nOur opening bowler was, quite simply,\nthe fastest bowler in the northern\nhemisphere. His name was George\nParkinson and not for him the inflated\nrun of these modern -weeds (for whom I am reluctant to use the hallowed term\n'bowler'). He would lumber in deceptively\nslowly from about 20 yards, and then\nbring his arm over in an action so\nferocious that faint-hearted spectators\nwould spill their ale. Unsuspecting\nworms to a depth of several yards would\nundoubtedly feel the impact, as the\nthose sitting on them and helping the\nCollege to get into the Guinness Book of\nRecords for having the largest private\ncollection of committees outside the\nCivil Service, will need PG reps, from\nthe groups and departments concerned. I trust that you will all give serious\nthought to this matter and be able to\nsupply people of the right calibre and\ndexterity to serve; otherwise I 'll bring\nback conscription.\nTo cast my mind back briefly to the\nsubject of finance and then forward to\n1977/78, (it makes you quite dizzy), you will probably have noticed in the\npress that drastic changes are being\nproposed in the system of fees. These may result in fees of \u00a3750 or more for\nboth home and overseas students. While\nmany of you will not be directly affected,\nmany of your colleagues will and the\nnumber of research places is also threat-e ned. A national campaign will be mounted\nto oppose these changes and I trust I can count on all of your support when\nthe time comes.\nOn the social side, I hope we can\norganise a few outings and social events\nbut I do not believe that the PG G should\nbe trying to provide college-wide events.\nI think that we would do better to work\nwith the other groups already organising\nsuch events to ensure that they are aware\nof PG tastes and peculiar habits, and\nalso to promote and help with social organisation at department level.\nNow I must go and have another bath\nso that we can water the tomatoes.\nPlease get in touch with me c/o the\nUnion if you have any bright ideas or\nproblems. The other two members of the\nPG G Exec are just slightly prettier than\nme so you may prefer to contact them.\nThey are Gabriel le Dai ley and Kafe\nDucie, both in the Botany department.\nHappy New Year!!!\nRick Parker\nICPGG Chairman\nleather cannon-ball struck earth and\nflew at the wicket, defended now by only\na pale shadow of the confident young\nhopeful, who, mere moments before, had\nstrolled to the wicket.\nThe Toffs managed to scrape together\n53 runs, and at 2 runs for 6 wickets we\nbegan to feel that the game was going\nagainst us.\nJimmy to the rescue\nNext in was our find of the season,\none Jimmy Parkinson, who even then,\nat the age of 9, had the soundest defence\nin England, and whose father grew\nmushrooms in his coal shed and often\nwon prizes at the local working-men's show.\nSufficient to say that Jimmy scored\nan undefeated 50, and we won by 4\nwickets; a victory that few there will ever forget, I have not seen a better\ninnings by an English batsman, and if\nthe selectors had even half an eye for\ntalent, Parkinson would surely have\nplayed in every Test Match from the\nthat day to this.\nDR CLARKSON New courses\nfor PGs\nFor far too long has the accusation\nbeen made, often with justification\nthat scientists are totally ignorant of\nsubjects outside their particular\ndiscipline. However, from the beginning\nof October, post grads at IC have a chance to rectify this. The Associated\nStudies Board are opening their courses,\npreviously run solely tor undergrads, to\nMSc and PhD students.\nUnlike the undergrads, for whom the\ncourses constitute part ot their degree,\npost grads will not be expected to take\nexams and a fairly informal basis is\nintended, with a strong emphasis on\nseminars rather than a rigid lecture\nschedule.\nAssociated Studies cover a wide\nrange of subjects within the Arts,\nLanguages, the Humanties and Social\nSciences. As well as being of general,\ninterest, several ot the courses are\nparticularly relevant to post grads, such\nas that on communication which would be\nvery useful for anyone writing up a thesis or considering a career in\nlecturing or certain branches of industry.\nIn response to a suggestion by the\nPostgraduate Group, an information\nsheet will be issued to all post grads via the registry at the beginning of term.\nFor anyone who feels that within their\nhard, scientific shell there is a budding\nhistorian, economist, politician or\nlinguist begging to be let out, all ICUPGG\nreps will have a copy of the full synopsis\nand timetable. (So it you don't know who\nyour departmental rep is, now's your\nchance to find out! Contact me in the\nBotany dept on int 2263).\nKate Ducie\nParker's Piece\n\n"

    "content": "6 - FELIX, SEPTEMBER17 th1976 mm&8& Loin)\nmmm\nWiWi\nmums\nDon't expect another Psycho FAMILY PLOT directed by Alfred\nHitchcock. (Empire, Leicester Square &\nABC Fulham Road)\nThis Hitchcock thriller earns an ' A' Certificate from the British Board of\nFilm Censors so do not expect another\n' Psycho'; if it were not for the few\nuncharacteristic swear words and\nunfulfilled passing references to 'hopping\ninto bed', I am sure Lord Har lech' s Board would have granted a unanimous\n' U'. One of Alfred' s lighter films then,\nbut none the worse for that.\nThe four leading players pair off\nneatly into two 'tricky' couples-Karen\nBlack and Bruce Dern play a rather\ncharacter less couple of big-time kidnappers\nwhose ransom demand is always a large gemstone, rather apt since Mr\nDern's legal line is as a fashionable\njeweller. The other couple are a medium,\nBlanch Tyler( Barbara Harris) and her\ncab-driver friend (William Devine). Their\ntrickery is simply small-time-Blanche's spiritual powers are not all that they\ncould be and so her friend is sent to\nfind information which she can use in\nher next 'trance' and thus keep her\nclients supplied with messages from\nthe other side. Since these two are the\n'goodies' their parts are not quite so blandly conceived. The paths of these couples are\nunknowingly brought together in pure\nHitchcock style and much fun is had\nout of the situation in which the smaller\nfish swim more and more out of their\ndepth. There are the usual Hitchcock set\npieces which include a witty kidnapping\nof a Bishop in full view of his con-greg ation. William Devine, who plays the cab-driver turned inept detective, has several\ndelightful moments, knocking out his\npipe on all manner of objects and seeming\nto find endless pencils and paper for\nhis notes.\nThe pace is a little slow and the\nscreenplay, from an oval by Victor\nCanning, becomes rather transparent\nwhen stretched over two hours, but\nHitchcock always presents an interesting\npicture and Barbara Harris and her\npartner are good enough to- carry the\nfilm's thinner moments.\nEric Stovell\nThin thread throughout grotesque film\nTHE TENANT directed by Roman\nPolanski; starring Roman Polanski\nand Shelley Winters'.\nThe first half of Roman Polanski' s new film, The Tenant, portrays the\ngradual onset of a persecution complex\nin a shy young Frenchman. After about an\nhour, however, you begin to feel that it\ncannot last much longer and are surprised\nto find that the thread is going to be\nspun out for another hour.\nPolanski, himself, plays Tr el kov sky, a mousy young clerk who takes over a two-roomed flat in a seedy Paris block.\nThe previous tenant Mademoiselle\nChoule, has thrown herself out of the\nwindow and through a skylight fifty feet\nbelow. Fate draws Trelkovsky to the\nhospital where he meets Stella, a grief-stricken friend of the suicide; together\nthey witness the final death-throes and a blood-curdling scream which echoes\nround the hospital.\nThe landlord is delighted to have such\na quiet tenant, but finds that all is not\nwell when Trelkovsky invites some\nfriends round for a Rouse-warming. The\nneighbours complain of the noise but\nthe guests don't care and make a noisy\ndeparture, increasing the tenant's anxiety.\nA series of bizarre incidents link\nTrelkovsky with Mile. Choule. The concierge delivers her letters to him, and\nat a nearby bar he is served with hot\nchocolate and cigarettes that she liked. He begins to see a conspiracy of the\nother tenants that will drive him to\nfollow his predecessor and he seeks\nrefuge with Stella.. But it is too late.\nHe returns to the flat and the film ends\nwith a grotesque sequence which cannot\nhave been designed to have the reception\nit received when I saw it.\nThe film is characterised more by an\nemphasis on detail which somehow\ndetracts from the whole. Individual\nscenes, like that in which one of\nTr el kov sky' s noisy friend turns his\nrecord player on full volume in the middle\nof the night and tears a strip off a timid\nneighbour who comes to complain: the\ncomplete antithesis of Tr el kov sky' s situation, are memorable, where the\nplot is not. It is perhaps because\nPolanski cannot succeed in playing so\nmuch of the film by himself - he comes\noff better when in company.\nThere is a delightful performance from\nShelley Winters as the Concierge, not\nmissing an opportunity to dust the\nbanister as she takes Trelkovsky up the\nlong staircase to see the flat.\nThomas Stevenson\nThe Welsh Connection\nSassafras \u2014 Riding High (Chrysalis)\nIn a strictly musical sense,I don't suppose any part of the country has\ntaken more to the sun-stoned idiom of\nthe West Coast than South Wales. Lets face it, the bands emanating from the\nCardiff \u2014 Swansea area have that\ndefinite sun bleached, half-stoned (!)\nmusical ideology that has typified the\nCaliforniafi music scene since1966.( No prizes for guessing where Ian\nMorse comes from \u2014 Ed)\nIf Man have lean t heavily towards\nthe Grateful Dead and Quicksilver, then\nSassafras have listened a lot to the\nmore country orientated bands like the\nBurritos and Eagles; Sassafras' s music being a combination of country\nrau nch and hard hitting truck in' music. With this new album the group have\ntaken their West Coast slanting a step further, trying to present themselves\nin a way more akin to their lively stage\npresentation. The album consists mostly\nof country-tinged truck in' songs with the\noccasional ballad thrown in for contrasts\nsake.\nThe title track starts the record off in\nstyle the band maintain throughout the\nset. E agli sh in feel, the song drives\nalong in fine style, with the tight harmonies\nand short, tasteful guitar work providing\nthe main interest. The slightly harder\nhitting 'Nothing to loose' is next up,\nfollowed by another up-tempo tune\n'Bad Blood'. After the first three lively\nopeners, the first side de solves into the\nslower ballad 'See Through a Mountain'.\nSide Two opens with 'New York\nCollapse', the two lead guitars combining\nto give a wistful air to the song;\nIts interesting changes of tempo remind\nme almost of some Spirit'sea lier work.\nAfter the well used Dankol Charles\nsong 'Small Town Talk' comes another\ndriving song, 'Long Short Lover' which\nhas fine harmony work and again the\ntwin lead guitars are used to very\ntasteful effect.\nThe next song just doesn't seem to\nfit in with the rest of the set, 'The\nBand Refused to Play', a slow moody\npiece that has little in common with the\nrest of what's been laid down. Then to\nend the album off, it's back to the\ndriving rock of 'Keep Rock 'n' Roll',\nplayed in the style I suspect the band\nenjoys most.\nWhether Sassafras move up a division as a result of this record is doubtful\nperhaps like Man, whats needed is a stomping live album, which is really\nwhat Sassafras are all about.\nIan Morse\n\n"

    "content": "4 - FELIX, SEPTEMBER17 th1976 FELIX, SEPTEMBER17 th19765Reading hadn't promised to be great, in fact on\npaper this year's lina-up wasn'ta patch on last\nyear's appearances by Yes, Robin Trower and\nWishbone Ash. Nevertheless few fans came away\ndisappointed from this yea fs event. The high spots of the festival came on Saturday and Sunday nights\nwhen blues guitarist Rory Gallagher and tropical\nsounding Osibisa respectively headlined the\nbill. Saturday's honours were also shared by\nCamel and Manfred Man's Earth Band. Manfred's band were on first at 5pm, just after a stirring\nset by John Hiseman's Colosseum 11, and a performance I'd rather forget from the Sadista\nSisters. Despite suffering the first heavy shower\nof the day, the Earth Band managed to pull together a tight, varied performance of basic rock mingled with slight experimentation,\nfeaturing numbers from the 'Nighingales &\nBombers' LP and 'A Word In Your Ear', their\nlatest album released two weeks ago. Two numbers that were particularly haunting and\ncaptivating were 'Father Of Day, Father Of Night'\nand, would you believe, one of Manfred's own\ncompositions \"Mighty Quinn\".\nI was expecting great cosmic happenings from\nPhil Manzanera & His Band, particularly since\nthe latter included the much acclaimed Brian Eno\nand ex Curved Air keyboard man Francis Monkman\nIn reality I found their net t offering rather drab\nand uninspiring, as did the crowd. At first the\nband's ry th m section held a strong lethargic\nbeat, completely inhibiting Eno. They changed\ntempo later on and got a creditable version of\n'Babe's On Fire' and the Kink's 'You really got\nme'.\nCompere John Peel wasn't happy either,\nLiverpool had lost, his only consolation being\nthat Everton had suffered the same fate. Still Camel made up for everyone's disappointments,\nshowing Eno just how experimental rock should\nbe played. The group have only recently come to\nthe fore with an excellent concept album 'Snow\nGoose' inspired by Paul Gallico' s famous short\nstory. Rich guitar harmonies and Pete Barden's keyboards dominate the group's music, which\nlies somewhere between rock and jazz. Back projection, smoke and lighting enhanced their\nrendition of the album.\nAfter a half-hour encore 'Lady Fantasy' from\nSunday saw British Bands Osibisa and\nSutherland Brothers and Quiver taking most of the\nspoils; the high-energy rock and roll of Black\nOak Arkansas earning them many fans, although\nanother American Ted Nugent proved a curious\nphenomenon!. Forever passionately thanking the\naudience, he seemed to be on a different planet to\nthe crowd, who were only to glad to get rid of\nhim.\nThe other two high-energy bands of the day,\nAC/DC and Sassafras were another story. The latter were troubled by a heavy shower that saw half the Press enclosure stam peed out in two\nminutes flat. Nevertheless, their brash, abrasive\nWelsh-rock, produced a charming innate response\nfrom the crowd, who'd been longing to get on their\nfeet, ever since the accomplished performance of\nThe Enid just after midday. The band is headed\nby aristocratic Robert Godfrey, complete with\nvelvet DJ, bow tie and cream trousers, whose wit\nand humour went down exceedingly well with the\naudience. The Enid's music was good to boot, a rather unexpected treat so early in the line-up.\nThe Australian band AC/DC weren't quite up\nto the calibre of Sassafras, but they were great\nto watch. Particularly entertaining was the stage\nantics of guitarist Angus Young, who at 16 is an\nexcellent comic. Their almost punk ish form of\nheavy rock is very similar to that of the Heavy\nMetal Kids. On this outing they over did the\ndramatics, but are a band to watch out for in the\nfuture.\nA year ago Sutherland Brothers and Quiver\nwere at the point of breaking up. Fortunately,\ndue mainly to manager Nick Blackburn, they\nper serve red and are today one of Britain' s all round rock hopes. S B&Q have almost a universal\nappeal as their event chart single \"Arms of\nMary\" showed. The band took a few numbers to\nfind their stride but never looked back after\n\"Dirty City\". Tim Ren wi ch was in great form,\nliterally shaking venom out of his guitar on\n\"Dirty City\", \"Love on the Moon\", and a new number \"Dark Powers\". \"Secrets\" is another\nbouncy new number on their next LP, and even\nthough the group claimed they didn't know the\nsong, it came over tremendously well. The band finished, with boogie numbers 'Dream\nWorld' and 'Bluesy World'. S B&Q well earned the\napplause that followed.\nTop marks for organisation\nFor the last sixteen years the Marquee organisation has put on a National,\nJazz and Rock festival. They were first held in Richmond, but the last five\nyears have seen the festival at Reading, right next to the River Thames.\nNot many of you will have heard of the Reading festival and I'd guess that's because it's well organised, very little trouble occurs, and it therefore doesn't make newspaper headlines.\nYet in 1975 crowds averaging 35,000 attended this three-day extra ve ganza and this year the totals exceeded an.average 25,000. The reason for this\nyear's drop lies chiefly with last year's festival which stretched facilities to\nnear breaking point. This year the Marquee Group pledged to Reading Borough\nCouncil that crowds would be limited to 30,000. To achieve this they booked\nless enterprising bands/ They need n't have bothered; Reading was in line for\nmany a bank holiday shower, which, besides keeping people away, stiff led any\nfears about the tinder-like campsite/\nWith the weekend over local residents, Police and festival organisers all\nagree that the 16th National Jazz, Blues and Rock festival has been almost\ntrouble-free/ The only 'major' incident occured on the first night, Friday, when\na couple of fans and a local reporter were slightly hurt by flying beer cans/\nThe trouble came after a reshuffle in the line-up of the groups caused two\nreggae groups to follow each other/Rock fans became restless during the second\nWest Indian act, MightyDiamonds, and shouted abuse at rival reggae fans.\"\nEmpty beer cans were later thrown between the two factions, who were\nseperated by the Press enclosure/This lasted about fifteen minutes/\nAlthough less fans attended this year's festival, there were more arrests.\nFigures released by the Police were as follows (with last years figures in\nbrackets): Total arrests 155 (115), drug arrests 121 (69), public order offences\n2 (15), drunkenness 6 (7). Despite the increase in arrests a Police spokesman\nDespite the Weather Reading Rocked on\nA report by Clive Dewey on the recent National Jazz, Blues and Rock festival at Reading\nCamel it looked like Rory Gallagher was in for a tough time. Far from it. You' d never have believed\nthat he' d played a gruelling concert in Stuttgart\nthat afternoon; Rory was menacing from the\nstart, his mes m eric guitar., blaze ning a trail of\nmagic throughout the 90 minute set. It's a wonder\nthe guy doesn't get heart failure, the way he\nrelentlessly ploughs on, hardly pausing for\nbreath between songs as he utters a garbled\n\" thank you very much\". The band started off with \" / Take What I Want\" a gutsy up-tempo track that sets the stage\nfor what's to follow. By the third number Rory' s belching vapor is ed breath, almost dragon-like;\non the outsized TV screen you can even see the\nsweat pouring off his arms. Rory hasn't changed\nmuch. He' s still wearing that sweat soaked red\nand white cheque d shirt and playing his battered\nguitar, slung hip wise, almost phallic like. All the old favorites were there, \"Tatoo\nLady\", the acoustic \"Too Much Alcohol\", and\nmany more besides. The band previewed the new\nGallagher Album \"Calling Card\" due out at the\nend of the month. Rory finished up with a12 minute rendition of the ever-popular \"Bullfrog\nBlues\" and stomped back to an energetic encore\nwith \"Messing With The Kid\". Who could wish for more?\nI found Ted Nugent rather uninspiring, in fact\nI gained more enjoyment from joining in the\ncrowd's perennial chorus of 'John Peel is ac***'( this well known phase was inspired by the DJ himself, particularly when the sound engineers\nplayed havoc with his records).\nBy the end of Nugent an overdose of rock\nand roll was in order. Black Oak Arkansas\nprovided it. They're absolute professionals who\nproduced acr sip, tight set that no-one can fault. Head singer Jim Dandy is a no nonsense\nshowman and guided the band along like an\nexpress train, with hardly a minute to spare, his blond mare trailing behind him as he s tutts around\nthe stage.\nInspite of the rain they had one hell of a party\nand sent everyone away in high spirits as well. It was perhaps just as well they did since the\nweather had the last laugh; five minutes after\nOsibisa had left the stage it poured down with\nrain, as though it hadn't rained for months!\nExuberant fans seemed to take it in their stride\nand by morning clothes and tents had begun\nto dry. Fans trudged their way through muddy\npaths that had been green grass the night before,\nand wended their way home, secure in the\nknowledge that they had witnessed another\nwell-organised successful rock festival. commended the vast majority of fans on being very well behaved. In his view\nthe festival had gone off very well.\nNumerous problems have bugged many a festival in bygone days, many of\nwhich can be classified under 'shortage of reasonably cheap food', and s anita tion. Reading overcomes the latter by ordering large numbers of 'mobile loos'\neach with its own hot and cold water supply. Conditions here might not be\nperfect, but at least these prove satisfactory. Another innovation of the\nReading festival is the daily clearing of the camp arena^na bling disposal of\nthe large quantity of beer cans. Glass is not allowed into the arena/ Both\nmeasures keep casualty figures for cuts down to a minimum, indeed the hospital\ntent was barely troubled during the whole festival.\nThe festival arena is plastered with many posters listing the agreed prices\nfor foodstuffs. Local traders in the arena charge no more than these prices, in\nfact the Salvation Army tent were charging 2\u20145p less per item! A rough sample\nof these prices in Tea lOp, coffee 13p, Hot Dogs 25p, Hamburger 30p, Chicken\nand Chins 55p. Booze prices are similarly limited/\nThe festival opens just after noon and goes on to midnight. Later\nperformances are strongly discouraged, since every year the Marquee lodges\n\u00a35.000 with the Borough Council. For every minute after midnight that the\nevent goes on, the Marquee loses \u00a3100. Last year they lost 3,400, this\nyear they lost nothing.\nSo there you have it folks, what is probably the best organised festival of its\nkind, certainly in Britain, and probably in Europe. I dare say you won't hear\nmuch of future Reading festivals, unless you're a music fan, because they\ncontinually win top marks for organisation.\nSutherland Brothers and Quiver grace the stage\n\n"

FREE Tricia Greenwood resigns\nWill Residence cope?\nHouses ready on time\nQUICK ACTION by College and Union officials. has\nensured the alleviation of\npreliminary fears that three\nstudent houses would not be\nopen at the start of the session. The houses concerned are\n51 Evelyn Gardens (part of\nMining House), 69 Evelyn Gardens (part of Willis Jackson House) and14 Queensberry\nPlace( Rayleigh House); all three had only recently been\nacquired by College and are\ncurrently undergoing major\nbuilding work to bring them\nup to the standard of other\nstudent houses.\nThe College had initially intended that ren n ovation work\nshould not spill into the new\nterm. However a delay in commencing the work caused the estimated finishing date to\ndrift well into term-time.\nBuildings Secretary, Don Clarke, who was overseeing\nthe work for IC, was on holiday\nat the time. In his absence\nDomestic Secretary Captain Lindley and Union President\nNick Brayshaw realised the\ndelay and took evasive action.\nOn Mr Clark' s return all three eagerly set about\nrenegotiating the building\ncontract. This has now been\ndone and ren n ovation work\nshould cease by September\n27th. This allows just enough\ntime to get carpets back into\n51 and 6 9 . Only minor work,\nsuch as the painting of\nkitchens is envisaged being\nprolonged into term-time.\nVandals\nLast Sunday at around 4pm a cupboard in the Snooker room\n(top floor of the Union) was broken into and vandal is ation done. The cupboard itself is a write off, as is the rest used\nto p rise open the cupboard.\nThe ICU Deputy President\nwould like,to hear from anyone\nin the Union Building at the\ntime.\nN UP E The College branch of N UP E( National Union of Public Employees) held a meeting\nlast Thursday to elect its new officers. The successful contestants were: RON BURNETT( Secretary), FRED BUR RIDGE( Chairman), RON PARKER( Minutes Secretary),\nJACK NUT BEAM( Auditor) and\nJOHN McHALE( Auditor).\nWith less than two weeks to go to the start of term, the\nresignation of Residence Officer Tricia Greenwood has posed doubts as to whether the overworked and understaffed\nResidence Office can cope with the immense volume of\nwork associated with the new term'.\nIt was precisely on the\ngrounds of staffing that Miss Greenwood had resigned in August. For months she had tried in vain to increase the\nclerical workforce in the\noffice from three to four. She\npoints out that in the last few\nmonths she had needed to\nhelp out her staff so much\nthat she found herself staying\nin College until 7pm most\nweekdays, as well as coming\ninto her office on Saturdays.\nThis, she admits, was just\nabout keeping things afloat.\n'Nevertheless I felt I was\nbanging my head against a brick wall over the issue of\nmore staff, so I decided to\nleave' says Tricia. Despite her confidence in\nher former colleagues Miss Greenwood doubts whether\nthey will be able to cope this\ntime around. 'The whole thing\njust could collapse'.\nNot surprisingly Tricia felt\nthat the superiors in College Administration did not fully understand the special problems\nfaced by her office in providing\nan essential service. FELIX broached the subject\nof under staffing with Miss Greenwood's immediate superior,\nDomestic Secretary Captain Lindley, but he preferred not\nto comment on the situation\nexcept to say:' I 've every\nconfidence in the staff there\n( Residence Office) and we've\nevery intention of coping. I realise the difficulties but\nwe've every intention of co pmg'. Union blaze\nMinor damage was sustained\nto the Union Conceit Hall last\nTuesday (7th September) when\na fire broke out on the stage\nfloor. Prompt action by two\nindividuals enabled the fire to\nbe put out within fifteen\nminutes, before it could take\nhold. An area of four square\nfeet of floor was later replaced.\nAt the time of the fire, the\nstage floor was undergoing\nsanding. The sander used for\nthe job had been unplugged,\nalthough the machine had been\nwell used throughout the\nafternoon. The cables wound\naround the machine's dust bag were rather hot, and eventually\nthese caused the dust bag to\nignite. The dust bag in turn\nset fire to the cables and the\nstage floor.\nSmoke had engulfed the\nstage when Andy Stevenson of\nPandora Theatre arrived on the\nscene. He emptied two fire\nextinguishers on the fire before\ncalling for the assistance of\nDP Derrick Everett. Five minutes later, at about 5pm, the fire had been completely\nextinguished.\nThe stage floor has now\nbeen re sanded and re sealed. insideS PEC I AL POST GRADUATE* ISSUE\nICU Exec - Pg2 Editorial - Pg3 Reading festival - Pg4/ report 5\nReviews - Pg6 Cricket - Pg7 X Word - Pg8 "

I hope I will be in fitter shape come the\nbeginning of term, literally as well as metaphorically since\nI'm just recovering from a dose of flu (which probably goes for\nyou too no doubt!)\nApathy is a word conned quite often to describe IC students.\nI 've used it many times myself, yet I had thought that IC\nPost Graduates would have submitted more copy for this issue than has been the case. That in itself is a shame since\nPG issues of FELIX will only continue if the editor feels\nthey are wanted. The response so far seems to indicate, they\nare not.\nTricia Greenwood\nCollege Administration can not afford to lose people of\nthe calibre of Tricia Greenwood. In sixteen months she had\ncome to terms with the problems confronting students where\nmany of her superiors had failed. She was prepared to tackle\nthe unique problems presented by students in a friendly yet\nefficient manner.\nThis earned her office high student respect and co-operation.\nBarring Registry there is not another College administrative\ndepartment that qualifies for the same praise. Yet the frustrating\nnature of the IC Administration finally claimed her as its\nnext victim.\nCertainly if College residence prices are forced up much\nmore, by bodies above Residence Office, then the College\nwill need all the student goodwill it can get to avoid empty\nhall places. The attitude of College Administration at large to\nstudents hardly fosters this student co-operation/\nCaptain Lindley says he understands the problems of\nResidence Office.\" Does he really? I'm told three weeks ago\nhe didn't even know the details of 'over allocation', even\nthough the lack of over allocation saw vacant hall places at\nthe beginning of last session.\nWhat I find em barra sing about the whole affair is that\nafter Miss Greenwood had resigned she was asked to go to\nPersonnel department. Here she was asked for a description\nof what her job involved so that an advertisement for her\nreplacement could be drafted. Apparently Mr Mellors was\nem barras ed at having to ask her this, and admitted the same.\nSurely Captain Lindley, the girl's immediate boss, could\nhave given an accurate job description, thus saving Personnels\nface.\nIf Captain Lindley does understand the problems that\nResidence office face, then why did Tricia Greenwood resign,\nwhen she was generally acknowledged to be doing a good job?\nFurthermore if the Captain doesn't fully comprehend\nResidence office problems, what of the future of the latter?\nCaptain Lindley was on the selecting committee for the new\nResidence Officer.\nCaptain Lindley prefers to hide behind a wall of silence/\nThat he is quite entitled to do provided the service to\nstudents does not suffer. I hope for the students' sake that\nResidence can indeed cope, and that Tricia's successor is\nnot fettered with the administrative strait-jacket worn so\nunwillingly by Miss Greenwood/\nSMALL ADS\nLast remaining AMSTRAD2000 MK IV Stero amplifier.\nMOT, taxed and tested.

Contact Nick Brayshaw ICU Office int 3915 4320 (evening)\nOnce upon a time there was a happy\nplace called ICU which was ruled over\nby the wise King, Nicholas I, and his henchmen Chalky and Mole. The former,\na prop a gator of white lies was under the\nimpression that the power behind the\nthrone was his; but in fact it was the\nwise old Mole who pulled the strings and\nfaithful Jen was always on hand, of\ncourse, to change their nappies.\nEnough of this flippancy; you all\nthought this was going to be a little\nfairy story, didn't you? Well look here,\nthis is a serious article by someone\ndoing a serious job - seriously. So what,\nyou may say; what is ICU to me, or me to\nICU? Most postgraduates seem to think\nthat the answer to both questions is\n\" nought\". Many students spend years\nat IC without going into the Union\nBuilding let alone the office. There's nothing we can do about that \u2014 we can\nonly provide the facilities and settle\nyour grievances.\nSo what is my job, as Deputy President?\nEssentially, to maintain and extend those\nfacilities. At present, I'm doing quite a few odd jobs in the Union \u2014 carpeting,\nputting in new curtains, buying furniture,\nhaving floors sanded, and so on. The\nstage is to be rewired in the near future,\nwhich is a pretty major job. You may have\nnoticed a couple of new, orange noticeboards in the Union Lower Lounge, and\na few more are on the way. The new pool\nORANGE\nMOLE\ntable will be installed in the lounge any\nday now and we're also getting a photo\nbooth put in the entrance hall. The J CR has been decorated and we're thinking\nabout new carpets. All I can say is \u2014 use\nthe facilities, and look after them! If you\nhave any complaints or suggestions, put\nthem in writing and send them to me.\nMy biggest headache at present is the\norganisation of Fresher s' Fair. At last\ncount I'd allocated one hundred and ten\nstalls(110) and at present I'm producing\nmaps showing the location of each stall, to be given out on the day (October 5th). Could all society Committees make sure\nthat they are organised for the fair;\nideally stalls should be set up by one\no' clock. Dort't forget that everyone is\nwelcome\u2014come along and join something.\nDerrick Everett\nTickets are currently\navailable for a recording of a new BBC Radio debating\nprogramme. The programme is to be chaired by Dick Taverne\nand the first discussion is\n' Provided he keeps to the\nlaw, a politician's life is his\nown affair.' The debate will be recorded in the Concert Hall of Broadcasting House on\nWednesday 29th September at\n7pm. Tickets from the Union Office. The FELIX staff would like\nto wish Linda Roussel,\nCollege Publications department a happy 24th birthday,\nwhich she celebrated yesterday/\nFELIX\nsends belated\nbirthday\ngreetings\nto the Rector\nwho was 52\non Monday\n\n"

She\nspent the weekend at the Isle\nof WightS team Railway Centre's annual Summer Show.\nThe journey to the Isle of\nWight was uneventful (it took\n4 hours to get to Portsmouth!)\nand included a trip on the\nPortsmouth to Fishbourne car ferry which, like C lem, is in its 50th year.\nC lem was the oldest internal\ncombustion engine vehicle of\nthe twenty or soon display and had travelled the greatest\ndistance to attend the show.\nOn each of the three days of\nthe show she was expected to\"\nappear in the grand parade of\nvehicles and then, after the\nevents for steam power vehicles, to take part in the driving\ntest for commercial vehicles. The three drivers with\nC lem took turns in the driving\ntest. They were required to\ndrive between oil drum\nmarkers, a comparatively\neasy task for a small vehicle like C lem despite her poor\nsteering lock. Of the drivers,\none demolished an oil drum, another had a clear round and\nthe third managed to stall the\nengine.\nThe return journey was more eventful. Just outside\nPortsmouth, C lem ground to a halt on a hill. A brief\ninspection showed that\nsomething was awry with the.\ntransmission. A telephone call was made to the A A and\nshortly afterwards a bemused\npatrolman arrived, having been\ntold that \" 1 9 2 6 Morris\" must\nreally mean \" 1 9 7 6 Leyland\". He arranged for A A Relay to collect C lem and after a couple of hours of Gales Real Ales all were aboard for\nthe trip back to London.

The ' old' procedure was that people applied for their\nnew visa at the time that the\nold one expired. The' new' practice is that you must apply\nfor a new visa before the old one runs out.
