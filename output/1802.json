Many scientists have cited the\nnetwork of open collaboration that EU\nmembership provides as a key reason to\nremain associated with Horizon Europe,\na metric that cannot be quantified\nthrough looking at changes in research\nfunding.\nResearch funding is split into seven\ndifferent categories when reported.\nThese are EU Commission, Charity,\nGovernment & NHS, Industry, Research\nCouncils, and Other.

The interest on student\nloans for those earning above \u00a349,130 is\ncurrently calculated by adding 3% to the\nRetail Price Index measure of inflation.\nThose earning between \u00a327,295 and\n\u00a349,130 will incur 9% interest plus a\ndiscretionary 0%-3% extra, up from the\ncurrent 1.5%. Those earning less than\n\u00a327,295 will incur the inflationary rate\nof interest.\nThe IFS acknowledge that the\nincreased rates \u201conly affect actual\nrepayments for the typically high-earning graduates that will pay off their\nloans\u201d.

Dissatisfied\nwith a lack of pay increases, potential\nredundancies and an, as far as I can\nsee, imagined threat of working\npractices being made worse, RMT\nGeneral Secretary Mike Lynch\nis throwing the country in at\nthe deep end and jumping\nstraight to striking, as\nopposed to negotiating with\nrail operators. According\nto the RMT press\nrelease following the\nvote, strikes will start\n\u201cfrom mid-June\u201d, leaving just\ntwo weeks for talks of any sort.\nThe salaries and working conditions\nof rail workers are not trivial, and I am\nwholly unopposed to improving the\nlot of the essential workers that keep\nboth us as passengers, and much of\nthe goods we buy in shops, efficiently\nmovingacrossthecountry.Buttheidea\nofstriking,asafirstresort,threatening\nwhat has been described as the biggest\nstrike since the General Strike of 1926,\nis ludicrous on a number of levels.\nFirst of all, this is very close to being\na conflict without a clear enemy. \u201cWe\nwantmoremoney!\u201dfrothsLynch.Who\npays this money? Well the 40,000 or so\nvoting RMT members work mostly for\nprivate rail operators who franchise\ntheir service from Network Rail. Rail\nuse is at about 75% of pre-pandemic\nlevels, and with that comes an obvious\ndrop in revenues. Fully nationalising\nthe railways is a different matter, but\nhow are the rail operators expected to\nraise salaries and job protections so\nmuch whilst taking only three quarters\nof the revenue they used to and with\nmuch the same operating costs? Not\nto fear, the railways are so essential\nthat they will always be baled out by\nthe government in times of economic\ncrisis, and indeed, the industry\nreceived \u00a316 billion from the taxpayer\nduring the pandemic. Revenues are\nnot miraculously going to increase\nso substantially between now and\nthe summer, so it\u2019s hard to see this\nstrike in any way other than holding\nthe taxpayer to ransom to protect\njobs that are no longer necessary.\nLynch notes when calling for strike\naction that the train operators \u201chave\nrefused to keep staff pay in line with\ninflationandsoaringliving\ncosts\u201d. It\u2019ll be a shock to\nhim, I\u2019m sure, to find out\nthat almost no industries\nare keeping pay packets\nin line with the rising cost\nof living, as that would be\nessentially untenable for all\nbut the largest employers (not\nto mention that a pay increase would\ndrive inflation further). Inflation is\npredicted to reach 10.25% this year,\nand an equal increase in salary to\nall RMT members being balloted\nwould cost hundreds of millions of\npounds that operators don\u2019t have.\nFurthermore, there is a very\npressing question of need. TotalJobs.\ncom states that the average Railway\njob pays \u00a345,000, and the average\ntrain driver gets paid \u00a354,000 a year.\nEarlier this month it was reported\nthat over two million adults in the UK\nhave gone without food for a whole\nday due to increasing food prices; I\nsomewhat doubt those earning \u00a345k\na year are included in this number.\nThe strike is expected to disrupt\nfreight by rail, and supermarket\nbosses are reportedly already making\nplans to ensure food remains on the\nshelves. One thing worse than rising\nfood prices would be if there was no\nfood available to buy at all.

Get your book reviews\nand articles submitted to\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nin the next few weeks to have\nthem published before the\nyear\u2019s up.\nTitle: Stuff Matters (Exploring the Marvelous Materials that Shape Our Man-Made World)\nAuthor: Mark Miodownik\nPeriodic Tales is a delightful read, and was one of my\nfirst forays into non-fiction and academic reading.\nHugh Aldersey-Williams spins narratives that revolve\naround the elements of the Periodic Table, exploring\nthe unique attributes of each one and their utilisation\nforpracticalpurposes.Healsodelvesintothescientific,\ncultural, and even political histories of each substance,\ntouching upon their applications in art, war, and litera-ture, among other sectors.\nPeriodic Tales was born out of a journey to acquire\na physical sample of every element known at the time\n(in 2011 - the time of writing - 116 were officially recognised by IUPAC). Through this search, which took\nhim all over the globe, Aldersey-Williams not only\nfound his samples, but also discovered stories and factoids about these building blocks of the universe.\nThe chapters are categorised into five separate parts,\ndenoted by the terms Power, Fire, Craft, Beauty, and\nEarth. These are categories that inspire the reader to\nview the elements from a fresh perspective; for exam-ple, to consider lead as a craftsman\u2019s material. While\nnot mutually exclusive, the groups are distinctive, defining the elements by a particular\npurpose. Each chapter has a curiously unique title pertaining to a\nproperty or application of the given element (or elements, as in the\nchapter titled Ytterby Gruva).\nAmong these unusual chapter\ntitles are Our Lady of Radium and\n\u201cLonely-Chrome America\u201d. The\nfirst details Marie Curie\u2019s tragic\nand incredible discoveries of the\nradioactive elements polonium\nand radium, as well as discussing\ntheir lesser-known uses in commercial products, prior to being\nlabelled hazardous materials.\nAldersey-Williams writes in a\nsimilar style to Mark Miodownik (see above), relating\neach element and its applications to his personal experience of searching for it. In the polonium chapter,\nhe mentions visiting the Curie Museum in Paris, and\nstumbling upon an old box of radium-branded shoe\npolish in his parents\u2019 house.\n\u201cLonely-Chrome America\u201d chronicles the story of chromium \u2013 as you\nmight expect \u2013 with regards to its\nrole in promoting early consumer-ism. Chrome-plating was utilised\nfor a variety of vehicles as well as\ngracing fashion runways and household appliances, but eventually\nbecame a symbol of superficiality.\nAldersey-Williams links the explosion of chromium\u2019s use in consumer products to America\u2019s recovery\nfrom World War 2 and the Great\nDepression.\nI would recommend Periodic\nTales to anyone looking to learn\nmore about the history of science and the extent of the\nperiodic table\u2019s influence on society. Whether it\u2019s the\nglow of the noble gases or the shine of platinum and\ngold, at least one of these elemental narratives is sure to\npique your interest.\nTitle: Periodic Tales (The Curious Lives of the Elements)\nAuthor: Hugh Aldersey-Williams\nIf you\u2019re a fellow Materials student, you probably\naren\u2019t a stranger to the title Stuff\nMatters, by Mark Miodownik. Glossing over the fact that this is a title that\nresides on the Materials undergraduate recommended reading list, this is\na book you can actually get stuck into.\nOccasionally literally, as one of the\nchapters \u2013 titled Delicious \u2013 details the\nchemical composition and structure of\nchocolate and sugar!\nInanycase,StuffMattersdoesn\u2019tjust\ncater to materials scientists; it\u2019s a layperson\u2019s guide to ten everyday materi-als, their molecular structure, and why\nit makes them behave the way they do.\nThese ten materials are derived from a\nsimple photograph of Miodownik sitting on his roof.\nFrom this photo he draws an ordinary\nexample of each material, such as a\npencil to represent graphite, or a garden table for steel, thus proving their\nnormality.\nMiodownik writes in a conversational tone, describing relatable instances in which the reader would\ninteract with the material at hand, an\nexample being the versatility of paper,\nwith its applications in communica-tion, decoration, education, and more.\nHe also discusses fascinating functions\nyou might not encounter, such as the\nuse of silica aerogel in space explora-tion; for catching dust particles (or\nspace dust) from meteorites. Miodownik continually\nlinks this information back to the concept of choosing\nmaterials with the optimum production capabilities\nand for the best user experience for a given product.\nEach of the ten chapters is labelled with an appropriate adjective (e.g., Fundamental for concrete, Invisible\nfor glass) and describes the properties and applications\nof the substance. The text itself is split into lovely bite-sized paragraphs, and is peppered with black and white\nimages, diagrams, and even a section of screenplay, giving the book a slightly whimsical feel.\nAs non-fiction books go, this one is as accessible as it\ngets, combining thorough scientific explanations with\na knack for storytelling, all complemented with creative illustrative features. This is a great read for anyone\nwho wants to expand their knowledge of the materials\nthat are used to construct the world around us.\n\n"

    "content": "The EU and Horizon Europe\nFollowing the Brexit vote, many may\nhave assumed that research funding\nfrom the EU would dry up, through\ndisdain towards the British as well a\nlack of formal association with the EU.\nThe available data actually suggests a\npositive trend for Imperial, despite a\nwider downward trend in EU funding\nto the UK. In 2019 the Royal Society\nreported that the UK\u2019s share of EU\nresearchfundinghadfallenby28%since\n2015, and that the number of European\nresearchers coming to work in the UK as\npart of EU fellowship programmes had\nfallen by a third.\nThe years 2016/17 to 2019/20 saw a\nsteady increase in funding awarded by\nthe EU to Imperial, from \u00a332.2 million\nto a peak of \u00a343.6 million. This then\ndrops back down to \u00a333.1 million in\n2020/21 (see graph on page 1).\nSuccess rates for funding applications\n(calculated very simply by dividing the\nvalue of funding received by the total\namount of funding applied for in a\ngiven year) shows a relatively similar\ntrend. Starting at 17% in 2016/17, the\nsuccessraterisesto23%in2018/19,and\nfalls back to 18% in 2020/21. Felix was\nadvised by the College that this data is\nnot the data they would normally use\nto calculate the success rate of funding\napplications, with an Imperial College\nspokesperson saying \u201cImperial has\nconsistently made the case that our\nresearchers need access to Horizon\nEurope. Collaborations in Europe\nform the essential building block to\nwider global engagement are vital to\nmaintaining research excellence.\n\u201cOur researchers continue to apply\nfor and win funding from Horizon\nEurope, without any significant losses.\nThe UK government has guaranteed\nto underwrite the Horizon Europe\ngrants already awarded. We welcome\nthis guarantee, whilst continuing to\nmake the case for the UK and the EU to\nfind agreement on association as soon\nas possible - this is in the interest of\neveryone and a clear win for European\nscience\u201d.\nThese outcomes are notable as the\nrelatively on-par results for the 2020/21\nfinancial year include several months\nafter the end of the Brexit transition\nperiod, where some may have expected\nfunding to take a down turn.\nData exists for the 2021/22 financial\nyear, correct up to 31/03/22. Felix was\nadvisedbytheCollegethatextrapolating\nfromthisdatawouldbedisingenuous,so\nwewillinsteadjustprovidethedataaswe\nhave seen it: application value to the EU\nfrom the College this year so far equals\n\u00a3144,772,862, and total award value so\nfar equals \u00a312,086,315, or around 8%\nof the application value. This percentage\ndoes not represent an accurate indicator\nof EU funding application success for\nthe 2021/22 financial year.\nUK Government Spending\nIn the March 2020 budget the\nChancellor set a target of government\nspending on R&D of \u00a322 billion per\nyear by 2025. This year, the Business,\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy\ndepartment lowered this target to \u00a320\nbillion in another statement, which\nis disappointing for many scientists,\nhowever still far more than the \u00a315.3\nbillion spent in 2020. From this news,\none might expect research grants from\nthe UK government and from research\ncouncils to start improving, as that\nreceived from the European body\ndecreases.\nCurrently, funding awarded by\nresearch councils to Imperial this year\nstands at \u00a385.8 million, suggesting a\ntotal of \u00a3128.8 million by the end of\nthis financial year. This stands at slightly\nmore than last year\u2019s taking of \u00a3124.9\nmillion, but slightly less than the \u00a3129\nmillion taken in 2019/20, and indeed\nthe \u00a3133.4 million awarded in 2017/18.\nCertainly not the significant increase\nthat one might have hoped for.\nFunding received under the\n\u2018Government and NHS\u2019 heading paints\na slightly rosier picture. So far this year,\nthe College has received \u00a349.7 million\nin this category, suggesting a total of\n\u00a374.6 million by the end of July. This is\nsubstantially more than the \u00a348 million\nreceived in the whole of 2020/21, and\ncomes close to the peak of funding\nreceived from this funding channel,\nwhich stands at \u00a376.4 million and was\nreceived in 2017/18. 17/18, however,\nwas anomalously high, and the average\nfor the previous five years excluding\n2017/18 is \u00a352.5 million.\nFRIDAY 27TH MAY 2022\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\n...continued from page 1\n\n"

They are unique and, by\ndefinition, take centuries to flourish.\nIt is estimated that HS2, the new\nhigh-speed railway under construction,\nwill result in 43 irreplaceable woods\nbeing lost or damaged (the Woodland\nTrustsuggeststheactualnumberis108).\nSo, what is being done to protect them?\nHS2\u2019s ancient woodland strategy\noutlines four compensation measures:\nenhancement of non-ancient woodland,\nenhancement of ancient woodland,\nnew woodland planting, and ancient\nwoodland soil translocation. By far, the\nmost emphasis is placed on new planting\nand soil translocation: enhancement is\nplanned in just 3 locations.\nFew would deny that new planting,\nif planned and managed correctly, is\ndesirable. Tree planting can improve\nbiodiversity, pull native endangered\nspecies back from the brink, and combat\nclimate change by drawing down and\nstoring carbon. But sadly, the current\nplans for new planting do not offset\nthe specific losses of ancient woodland\necosystems.\nThat leaves soil translocation,\ndescribedbyHS2asthebestopportunity\nto preserve biodiversity. Translocation\nmeans that after trees are felled, some\ntopsoil (the top few inches of earth,\nwhere most plants and microbes live),\ndeadwood and tree stumps are salvaged\nand placed at receptor sites.\nFew studies have tracked the long-term impacts of this method. However,\none 25-year-long study found that while\nplants grew in the translocated soil, the\ncharacter of woodland at the receptor\nsite was \u2018profoundly altered\u2019 from that\nof the donor site. In particular, unique\nancient woodland indicator species did\nnot survive the process.\nThis happens because the soils of\nreceptor sites do not have the character\nof ancient woodlands, as Dr Will Pearse,\nSenior Lecturer in Applied Ecology\nat Imperial College London, explains:\n\u201cSoil microorganisms are intimately\nassociated with the plants that root\ninto the soil, and whatever of them\n[microorganisms] survive being moved\nwill be outcompeted by the organisms\nat the place they\u2019re moved to\u201d. This is\nwhy the age of ancient woodlands is so\nimportant. It takes everything: centuries\nof tree growth, the establishment of\nindicator species, and the weaving\ntogether of hundreds of species of\nplants, fungi and microorganisms, to\nmake an ancient woodland. One is not\nsimply made by moving soil.\nTranslocation has other issues to\ncontend with. Firstly, after the damage\ndone by felling trees, only 20-40% of\ntopsoil from donor sites is typically\nviable, so in practice, translocation\ninvolves moving only a small proportion\nof already damaged topsoil to a receptor\nsite, perhaps with some dead branches\ntossed on top.\nFurthermore, behaviour on site is\nnot always as careful and considerate\nas HS2\u2019s strategy documents might\nsuggest. For example, in 2020, five sites\nwere translocated in the spring, despite\ninitial assurances that all would be done\nin autumn or winter when most plant\nlife is dormant. Tearing up plants when\nthey are just bursting into bud is an\neffective way to ensure that life doesn\u2019t\nsurvive. Nevertheless, HS2 can still\nclaim compensation measures have been\ncarried out at those locations.\nCompensation is all that this is: a\nrecognition that great harm is being\ndone. Is it better than doing nothing\nwhile ancient resources are razed? Sure.\nBut it is nothing more than that.\nWhat we are losing is truly\nirreplaceable.\nNell Pates Environment Writor\nCOMPENSATION IS\nALL THAT THIS IS:\nA RECOGNITION\nTHAT GREAT\nHARM IS BEING\nDONE\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 27TH MAY 2022\n11\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nHahyun Lee\nEnvironment View online here!\nScience doesn\u2019t support HS2\u2019s ancient\nwoodland strategy\nCredit: Dan Blackburn/Unsplash\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nComputers will make our\ndrugs in the future\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nDrug discovery is a hard, time-consuming and expensive process.\nA single drug spends around 10 years\nin the lab before being released into\nthe market. Furthermore, more than\n99% of all the potential drugs end up\nunsuccessful. The rise of AI, as well as\ngiant databases, seem to promise a new\nfuture in which drugs will be developed\nquicker, but will also be safer and more\neffective.\nBefore developing any drug, we\nneed to find a biological site of interest\nthat can be related to a disease. For\nexample, GPCRs are cellular receptors\nthat regulate cell proliferation and are\ninvolved in many cancers. Thus, creating\ndrugs targeted at GPCRs is sensible and\nindeed,GPCRsareoneofthemainareas\nof research in our fight against cancer.\nThe discovery of a potential biological\nsite is challenging because sometimes\nwe cannot characterise it entirely and/\nor delivering the drug to it would not\nbe an easy task. This also means that we\nneed to study many different biological\nsites, usually thousands of them through\nexperiments, which takes up time and\nmoney. Using AI to run simulations of\nbiological sites allows us to screen them\nmuch faster as we are not limited by how\nmany experiments we can carry out.\nNow that the drug target is identified,\nwe need to actually develop our drug.\nTraditionally, this is done by humans\nthrough trial and error, but maybe in\nthe future, computers could design\nthe drug for us by analysing the\nstructure of the biological site through\nsimulations and dataset evaluation.\nLarge and reliable datasets are essential\nfor machine learning - the process by\nwhich computers \u2018learn\u2019 from data \u2013 as\nit allows for better performance, and\nso better and faster drug discovery.\nPrecisely because the datasets must be\nlarge, these will arguably force labs and\npharmaceutical companies around the\nworld to share the data of their research\nwith each other in order to increase\nthe performance of computers in drug\ndiscovery. Could this make patents\nand IP obsolete? The traditional way\nof making money from pharmaceutical\nresearch would not be as effective as it\nis today. In that hypothetical future, the\nbenefits of sharing your information\nare much greater than keeping it for\nyourself. There are two main types of\ndata: sequence and imaging data. The\nfirst one is about the sequences of DNA,\nRNA and proteins, whereas the second\nis about structures of molecules/cells\nlike proteins/mitochondria. There\nis another type of data that has the\npotential to revolutionise the way we\nunderstand genetics and drug discovery:\nepigenetic data, meaning the changes in\ngene activity caused by the environment.\nHowever, epigenetic data is very variable\nbetween individuals. Thus, the data is\nsubject to particular interpretations and\nmay not be easily storable.\nComputers acquire information from\nthese large datasets to integrate into\ntheir behaviour patterns to optimise\ntheir responses in a process called deep\nlearning. The capability of deep learning\nis unbelievable. With it, computers can\ndetermine the structure of proteins by\njust reading their amino acid sequence.\nThis is a milestone in molecular biology,\nas predicting how proteins fold has been\nimpossible for humans to determine as\nthere are too many factors to take into\naccount.\nHaving said that, a world where all\ndrugs are designed by computers is still\nfar away. Even though there are many\ncompanies dedicated to this area of\nresearch and there are already functional\nprototypes, the pharmaceutical industry\nmoves very slowly and mass-scaling a\nproduct is complicated not only due\nto logistics but also the necessity to\nguarantee high efficiency and safety.\nTo conclude, at present, there is a\nneed for significant investment, in order\nto develop and commercialise drugs.\nPharmaceutical companies and research\ninstitutions are under constant pressure\nto obtain more patents, which do not\nnecessarily succeed in the goal of drugs:\nto improve people\u2019s quality of life. Not\nonly could computers dramatically\nacceleratethedrugdevelopmentprocess,\nbut they might also democratise it by\nforcing organisations to make their data\npublic.\nThe development of AI and large datasets will help automate the processes of drug discovery and\ndevelopment.\n\n"

Their daughter,\nplayed by Stephanie Hsu, lives a\nsilent rebellion whilst struggling to reconcile her\ntwo national identi-ties.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n18 Music.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nHow to Run a Temperature with Florence + the Machine\nWritten by Matija Conic Music Writer\nFlorence + the Machine release their long-awaited album, Dance Fever.\nAlbum Review\nKendrick Lamar dropping his long-awaited record\nvery much rendered a lot of other things that\nhappened on May 13th\ninsignificant and comparably\nforgettable. While this truly was one of the more\nmemorable moments in his discography, a few projects\nhaveunfortunatelyflownundertheradarbecauseofthis\nrelease.Infact,oneofthebandsthatalwaysflowsunder\nmy radar has rolled out a full length LP \u2013 no one other\nthan Florence + The Machine, the band that normally\noccupies a miniscule portion of my RAM due to, well,\nfor the most part just being fairly meh. Admittedly, I\nalways found Welch\u2019s vocals to be highly impressive,\nbut all of the band\u2019s songs have sort of melded into\none big \u2018You\u2019ve Got the Love\u2019 kind of track inside my\nbrain. Still, what I have discovered in Dance Fever\nhas exceeded my expectations in every possible way.\nThe production on this record is quite\nminimalistic, but nonetheless potent and elegant,\nwith an almost medieval quality to it. On top of\nthis, Welch\u2019s theatrical vocals take the listening\nexperience to a whole new level. The first teaser\n\u2018King\u2019 is a true anthem, describing Welch\u2019s struggle\nbetweenfollowingherpassionsandtheexpectations\nsociety places on her. She starts off the song\ndepicting a conversation about having children with\nher partner over pounding drums, a decision that all\ntoo often requires women to make career sacrifices\nin a patriarchal setting. Nonetheless, she shouts\na resounding \u201cno\u201d at this expectation with the\npowerful,\u201cIamnomother,Iamnobride,Iamking\u201d.\nThe song gradually devolves into unpredictability,\nmaking this verse become even more hard hitting,\nwith the roaring scream at the end finishing the track\non a perfect note. Such a sentiment is nonetheless\ncontrasted with her internal conflict over the same\npossibility, making it read more as an angry reaction to\ntheworldthatplacesthatdilemmainfrontofherinthe\nfirst place, whereas men remain entirely spared of that\nstruggle. Lyrically, \u2018King\u2019 is by far the strongest cut on\nthe record and is a very fitting opener, as Dance Fever is,\nmore than anything else, an ode to Welch\u2019s craft, as well\nas an ode to music itself, portraying it as her personal\ntherapy, whatever the anxieties in question may be.\n\u2018Free\u2019 depicts Welch\u2019s mental health demons as \u201cpicking\nher up and putting her down\u201d repeatedly throughout\nthe day, with her only solace being this compulsion\nto \u201ckeep singing\u201d, to the point where she wonders\nwhether she should \u201cbe medicated\u201d. In addition to the\npressures of a patriarchal society, the amazing \u2018Dream\nGirl Evil\u2019 depicts another fear Welch experiences in\nface of broader expectations. Sonically, this cut is\ndefinitely a huge highlight, with Welch\u2019s vocals being\ntruly outstanding, filling you with incredible energy\nand euphoria. Throughout the track, she angrily rejects\nthe notion of being some sort of \u201cangel\u201d, preferring\nthe world to appreciate her dark, imperfect side\nrather than some fabricated appearance of perfection.\nOne big over-arching theme on Dance Fever is how\nthe pandemic has impacted Welch\u2019s insatiable desire to\ncreate, dance and perform. The third teaser, \u2018My Love\u2019\nis not too lyrically ambitious, with common tropes\nlike lack of inspiration and pandemic-induced writer\u2019s\nblocks. Nonetheless, it is one of the biggest bangers the\nband has rolled out in a long time, with perhaps the\nmost recognisable, Florence + The Machine sound out\nof all the tracks on the record. House-y beats, synth-y\nstrings and angelic vocals are all there to make this\nsong a breathtaking experience, exemplifying the title\n\u201cDance Fever\u201d in the best way possible. In \u2018Cassandra\u2019,\nshe sings about her artistic struggles further, employing\nthe character of Cassandra \u2013 the princess of Troy who\nwas gifted with the ability of prophecy, but cursed\nby Apollo for not wishing to disclose his future to\nher, resulting in nobody ever believing her again. The\nmythological metaphor is an interesting way to voice\na struggle many artists have encountered during the\npandemic, lacking an audience to showcase their art to\nand share their emotions with. The epic \u201cCan you see\nme, I cannot see you\u201d feels like it is being delivered to a\nhuge, empty concert hall, with Welch singing her heart\nouttonobody.Thisyearningforliveperformanceiseven\nmore explicit on the track \u2018Girls Against God\u2019, where\nshe wishes to battle God for inflicting this punishment\non her. Still, this remains one of the less memorable\ncuts given the fairly bland production. \u2018Daffodil\u2019 is\nanother track that reads as a more general yearning for\na return to a pre-COVID era. The notion of \u201cletting\nthe helpless optimism of spring\u201d enter Welch\u2019s mind\nis contrasted with the chorus simply going \u2018Daffodil\u2019\nover and over again over a mindlessly monotonous,\nbut nonetheless extremely hard-hitting beat that feels\nlike it has a life of its own, thumping independently\nof the lyrics, while still pushing you towards a dance-y\nmood. In some ways, this juxtaposition reminds me of\nhow little sync there was behind the expected flow of\none\u2019s life and the enforced routine of the pandemic.\nOn other tracks, the minimalistic production did\nnot work as well as it did on tracks like \u2018King\u2019, for\ninstance, in spite of Welch\u2019s consistently amazing\nvocals, examples being \u2018Back in Town\u2019 and \u2018Heaven\nis Here\u2019. The latter track, though vocally exciting at\ntimes, does eventually become dull, as it feels like it\ncould have explored the vocal experimentation a\nlot more and possibly lead the track towards a more\nexciting finish. Still, any residual boredom quickly\nevaporates as my definite highlight of the record\nbegins to play \u2013 \u2018Choreomania\u2019, a song named after the\nphenomenon of quite literally uncontrollably dancing\nuntil complete exhaustion. The setting that comes to\nmy head as the bubbling beat begins is that of light\nrain pouring down on me at 5 AM while I indulge\nin my thoughts and struggles, some of which are\nentirely inconsequential and over-romanticised (\u201cAnd\nI am freaking out in the middle of the street/With\nthe complete conviction of someone who has never\nhad anything actually really bad happen to them/\nBut I am committed, now, to the feeling\u201d). Still, the\nrising tempo has an almost hopeful feel to it. The song\nevokes sadness in me, coupled with a strange form of\nalmost trance-like happiness, caused by the sheer joy\nof existence. For a minute, this track invites you to\nforget about your worries and drown in the beauty of\nthe moment in front of you, while also sending you in\na meta-introspective state that feels weirdly enjoyable.\nOverall, Dance Fever definitely lives up to its name\n\u2013 it is an incredibly cathartic and euphoric journey\nthrough emotional struggle, told through the recurring\nmotif of \u201cdancing\u201d your pain a way. Though the\npandemic-related tropes do hit with lower potency\nthat they used to given their prevalence across the\nboard, I do think that Florence + The Machine give a\nsufficiently versatile and creative spin on them. Most\nof all, however, this album is a true demonstration of\nWelch\u2019s anthemic vocal ability, with tracks that are\nguaranteed to stick around with you for a long time.\nMUSIC\nDance Fever album by Florence + the Machine\n\n"

The pop-duo had just released their debut\nalbum in May, made up of two EPs: Sometimes\ndepressed\u2026 but always antifascist. I ignored the email.\nA month later, I was looking for something new\nto listen to (as a pretentious music journalist, I derive\nmost of my life satisfaction from finding new music\nto get a small dopamine rush when I put it on the aux\nand somebody asks for a track ID). I remembered this\nalbum, and decided to give it a try. Within weeks, I\nhad listened to it so many times that BS\u00cd were on my\n2021 Spotify Wrapped. I was truly ecstatic when I was\nwalking home on Wednesday and saw that the duo had\nreleased a two-side on 28th\nApril titled Relax, Blabla,\nfeaturing two new singles, \u2018Jelly Belly\u2019 and \u2018New Moon\u2019.\nBS\u00cd are named after the \u201cmost depressing place in\nIceland\u201d, the Reykjavik central bus terminal, though\non their Bandcamp, they go by \u2018Brussels Sprouts\nInternational\u2019. They are formed of Sigurlaug \u2018Silla\u2019\nThorarensen on drums and vocals, and Julius Pollux\nRothlaenderonbassandtoe-synth.Thepop-duoispart\nof Reykjavik\u2019s art-collective, rooted in anarchist-ideals\nand based around the idea of DIT (Do-It-Together),\ncalled post-dreifing. The movement rejects the music\nindustry\u2019s capitalist model, and instead aims to just\ncreate and have fun without focusing on profit. The\ncommunityisknownforcounteringracismandfascism\nin Iceland, leading post-dreifing to be seen\nas a political group,\neven though many of\ntheir artists do not\nmake political music.\nBS\u00cd, however, are\nopenly political in\ntheir lyrics. The duo\nmarries punk and\nsummery indie-pop\nin their songs which\ncover issues such as sexism and feminism. My\nfavourite song of theirs, \u2018My knee against kyriarchy\u2019,\nis named after a feminist concept that describes an\nintersectional form of patriarchy covering all forms\nof oppressive structural hierarchies such as sexism,\nracism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia.\nOpposition to oppression is a theme throughout\nBS\u00cd\u2019s music, whether they present these themes in riot\ngrrrl inspired songs, or in a buoyant indie-pop bop.\nThe two singles on Relax, Blabla couldn\u2019t contrast\neach other more. \u2018Jelly Belly\u2019 maintains the danceable,\nupbeat riffs of previous singles such as \u2018My knee against\nkyriarchy\u2019. The track\u2019s energy is restless and contagious,\nwith a frantic and rushed dissonant bassline that\nexplodes into a fun and optimistic chorus dripping\nin reverb, as Thorarensen sings \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m\nsmelly/I don\u2019t care \u2018bout my jelly belly\u201d. The band\ndescribe the song as a group-therapy session at\n157 bpm \u2013 the whimsical melodies and dreamy\nsynths and pads conceal the pain and trauma in the\nlyrics in a way not dissimilar to Mitski\u2019s \u2018Nobody\u2019.\n\u2018New Moon\u2019 is a stark contrast. The track is\nsparse, with little other than whispering vocals\nset against a subdued baseline. Percussion is\nintermittent throughout the single, though it is\nbarely noticeable. A dark and moody atmosphere is\nset through the droning synths in the background\nas Thorarensen sings \u201cWho knew new moon?/Who\nknew caring could be so hard?\u201d The track fades out\ninto silence, with little more than a muted synth drone.\nBS\u00cd don\u2019t seem to be playing London anytime\nsoon, though I could not recommend listening\nto their debut album more, and perhaps\nchecking out some of the other amazing artists\ncoming out of Iceland\u2019s post-dreifing scene.\nToreadmoreaboutIceland\u2019spost-dreifingcollective,\nand the music coming out of the scene, check out Joe\nZadeh\u2019s2019articleinTheFace,andJohnRodgersand\nRX Beckett\u2019s 2019 article in The Reykjavik Grapevine.\nSingle Review\nMUSIC\nhundreds others. At the other end of the spectrum, an\nelectronic group might drive a crowd insane with just\na beat drop. So where does a\nfolktronica group like alt-J fall?\nAfter the opening act,\nWilderado (an indie folk\nband belonging to Tulsa,\nOklahoma), the Leeds trio\n\u2013 Gus Unger-Hamilton, Joe\nNewman and Thom Sonny\nGreen \u2013 mounted a platform\non the stage. They didn\u2019t run\naround, wave at the crowd \u2013\nor move, for that matter. Gus stood on the left with a\ndouble keyboard, Joe in the centre with a guitar, and\nThom on the right with his peculiar drum kit. Thom\nonce actually explained his unique percussive setup in\nconversation with MusicRadar: bass drum, toms, and\nsnares, then bongos, tambourine and a cowbell stuffed\nwithnewspapertoreducetheresonance,butnocymbals.\nWhenthethreepracticedplayingduringtheiruniversity\ndays, Thom got used to working without any cymbals\nbecause they simply didn\u2019t fit in their small bedroom.\nBefore they began their setlist, a screen box\ndescended over them upon which the image of a single,\nflickering candle was projected. It eventually found\ncompany with dozens more reflecting\noff the ceiling of the O2 as the band\nopened with the first track, \u2018Bane\u2019 on\ntheir new album, The Dream. It was\nspooky, unsettling, and exactly what\nI\u2019d expect from this band. Joe\u2019s soft\ndistinctive voice sounds exactly as it did\non the studio recording, because, as he\nsays it, it\u2019s just what\u2019s most comfortable\nfor his throat. As ever, he was\ncomplemented by backing vocals from\nGus Unger-Hamilton, although having seen them\nlive, I wouldn\u2019t call them \u201cbacking\u201d. Gus\u2019 much deeper\nvoice serves more as a foundation for their songs upon\nwhich Joe\u2019s lead vocals meander, emerging especially\ntrue when they sang the a cappella \u2018Interlude 1\u2019.\nWhat separated this concert from others I\u2019ve\nbeen to would definitely be the ingenious visuals.\nThe screen box projections were an incredible way\nof entirely changing the perception of the songs. The\nway you read a book and raise your eyebrows when\nyou watch the movie based on it, the illusion of the\nband walking on the sun while singing \u2018U&ME\u2019\nshifted what I imagine when I listen to it. \u2018Something\nGood\u2019 was accompanied by a visual of bubbles under\nwater, looking like they were performing in a fish tank.\nI couldn\u2019t imagine it would be easy to perform\nfolktronicalivegiventhedelicatebalanceofinstruments\nand electronic elements, but I was blown away by how\nalt-J maintained every nuance in their songs \u2013 from\nthe light clicks before the cultish vocalisations in\n\u2018Bloodflood\u2019, to the short half-breaths that intersperse\nwith shakers in the beginning of \u2018Deadcrush\u2019.

From the Felix offices, weary-eyed reporters could make out the Union\u2019s Chief Risk Assessor, Sylvia Williamson, tip-toeing back to her a desk\nin a cartoon-like fashion, just minutes after the last\nof her colleagues had left for home. After clattering\nher password in incorrectly the first two times, Sylvia\nlogged in and accessed the central Risk Assessment\nprogramme and opened up a recent file on a Women\u2019s\nFootball pub crawl. Looking over her shoulders one\nlast time, she then typed in a new entry that we could\njust make out through the grainy camera footage:\n\u201cCould slip when descending tube station steps - re-review\u201d. We had her.\nWe didn\u2019t know it at the time, but NegaFelix had just\nuncovered a nation-wide \u201cBig Risk\u201d syndicate, formed\nto surgically insert risk into totally mundane activities\nin order to protect thousands of jobs in the field across\nthe country.\nA months long NegaFelix investigation kicked off when\na member of IC Cheerleading approached us to complain that a cheer practice event have been postponed\nby the Union on the grounds that \u201csomeone could fall\nover\u201d. Following our aquisition of the damning Williamson clip, we confronted the Risk Assessment team,\nwho crumbled like a soggy rich tea.\n\u201cBack in the \u201870s students regularly got hammered\non open rooftops and hosted tipsy sword fights using\nImperial memorabilia\u201d said Sylvia when explaining her\nactions. \u201cNo doubt that risk assessors were needed\nback in those days.\n\u201cBut then come the 2010s and everything\u2019s changed.\nCollege rules stop almost all exciting events from\ntaking place, new laws stand in the way of many of the\nmost perilous activities, and common sense holds back\neverything else.\u201d\nMs Williamson went on to express distaste for how\ntimes have changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve lobbied hard over the past\nfew decades against universities extending their tentacles further and further into the lives of students, but\nalas we did not win that battle. Now Universities have\na greater duty of care over their students than parents\ndo over their children. What the hell are us risk assessors supposed to do when everything remotely risky is\njust banned altogether?\n\u201cThrough some totally twisted irony, a lack of risk\nactually puts our livelihoods at risk. We hatched the\nsolution many years ago, where we started exaggerating the risk of things that people already new about\nas a reason for us to keep on working. \u2018Oh, someone\nmight get too drunk and start vomiting on this pub\ncrawl\u2019 we\u2019d say, and even though that\u2019s the most obvious statement in the world the leadership lapped it up\nand kept paying our salaries.\n\u201cThe last five or so years have required some truly\nridiculous mental acrobatics to come up with even less\nrisky things that we can assess the risk of.

The responses we got didn\u2019t\nmention the wasting of student tuition fees at all,\nand instead just asked us to ensure that appropriate\nsignage had been erected in any area where beans had\nbeen spilled, and to promptly inform the Estates team\nso they could be cleaned up.\n\n"

    "content": "Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that\ngrows in the tissues of the prostate\nglands in men. These glands, although\njust the size of a walnut, are the source\nof the most diagnosed cancer in the UK.\nEvery year almost 47,500 men suffer\nwith prostate cancer and this figure is\nprogressively rising, with almost 1 in 6\nmen being currently diagnosed in the\nUK.\nAs with all types of cancer, early\nidentification and treatment is key to\nimprove prognosis. However, the slow\ngrowth and nature of prostate cancer\nmeans that alarming symptoms, such as\nbloodappearinginurineandinterrupted\nurineflow,donotbeginuntilthetumour\nhas already developed.\nA new prostate\ncancer test:\nMulti-Parametric\nUltrasound\n(mpUSS)\nResearchers at Imperial\nCollege London, University College London and\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust have recently developed a new\ntype of scan that could\npotentially help with the\nearly detection of prostate\ncancer. The technique,\ncalled Multi-Parametric\nUltrasound (mpUSS) uti-lises soundwaves to take\nimages of the prostate.\nThe method was tested in the new trial,\nCancer Diagnosis by Multi-Parametric\nUltrasound of the Prostate, or CADMUS.\nThe CADMUS trial included 370\nmale patients who were identified as\nhaving a high risk of prostate cancer by a\nround of initial tests. The men were then\nrequired to undergo both a mpMRI and\nthe new mpUSS scan \u2013 a total of 257\nmen were identified as having a positive\nmpUSS or mpMRI result. Further diagnosis of prostate cancer was confirmed\nfor these patients through a biopsy, and\nabnormal tissue was subsequently detected in 133 men: mpUSS had detected\n66 cases and mpMRI detected 77 cases.\nAlthough mpUSS detected 4.3% fewer\nprostate cancer cases compared mpM-RI, the test resulted in 11.1% more patients having a biopsy \u2013 this was due to\nthe mpUSS scan occasionally detecting\nabnormal areas where there is no cancerous tissue. However, this can be advantageous for patients as it encourages conducting more biopsies and being tested\nthoroughly, rather than potentially failing to detect a cancerous tissue.\nWhat does this mean for the\nfuture of prostate cancer?\nAs the mpUSS scan is more affordable and is faster to conduct than the\ncurrent mpMRI, this can greatly reduce\nthe economic impact of testing on the\nNHS. Additionally, it will allow for\nmore men to undergo the test, which\ncould potentially lead to a reduced\nnumber of severe prostate cancer cases.\nThe mpUSS is also favourable for\npatients with metal hip replacements,\npacemakers, or claustrophobia, whilst\nstill maintaining an effective prostate\ncancer diagnosis. Worldwide, this technology provides an alternative, cheaper\nmethod of diagnosis, and could therefore be invaluable for men in developing countries, where cases are already\ncommon and rapidly increasing. The\nmpUSS scan is expected to help reduce\nprostate cancer development through\nearly detection, and could even be used\nalongsidecurrent methods.\nThe CADMUS trial was funded by\nThe Jon Moulton Charity Trust and\nProstate Cancer UK.\nFRIDAY 27TH MAY 2022\n5\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSaachi Sachdev Science Writer\nProstate cancer affects 1 in 6 men in the UK, but detecting it is a lengthy and expensive process. Saachi\nSachdev explores how researchers at Imperial College London are working to change this\u2026\nProstate cancer is typically diagnosed with the Multi-Parametric Magnetic\nresonance imaging (mpMRI) technology. This type of scan can detect\ncancer in the prostate gland by effectively combining 4 separate images\ntogether, producing a more detailed image compared to a standard MRI\nscan.\nThe mpMRI method, although over 93% effective, can be expensive and\ntime consuming, which greatly limits the number of scans a doctor is\nable to carry out. Moreover, patients who have undergone procedures\ninvolving the insertion of metallic components (such as pacemakers) are\nexcluded from mpMRI due to its utilisation of a magnetic field, which can\ndamage metallic devices. As prostate cancer risk increases with age, this\nlimitation poses a problem for the older population of men, who comprise\na large proportion of patients who have undergone excluding procedures.\nIn order to screen as many of the at-risk population as possible, a different\nfaster and more cost-effective scanning method is required to ensure early\ndiagnosis is achieved.\nEXPLAINER\nThe current prostate cancer test: Multi-Parametric MRI (mpMRI)\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nCheap and fast prostate cancer test developed\nBiopsy - a test that takes a tissue\nsample from a patient, so that it\ncan be analysed underneath a microscope to confirm the presence of\nabnormal, cancerous cells.\nAt higher risk of prostate cancer:\n\u2022 Men over 50 years of age\n\u2022 Those with African ancestry\n\u2022 Those with a family history of\nprostate cancer\n\n"

Bradford\u2019s work is a reminder that our bodies are nothing more than biological machines. Given the right inputs, certain responses\nwill result. As autonomous and free as I feel, my body\nis just responding to its world, to the various stimuli\nit encounters. For some that might be terrifying. For\nothersitisreassuring,somethingundeniablystableand\npredictable in a chaotic world.\nHampsteadTheatreiscosy;itsstageslantingdownwards towards the audience, grey and completely\nempty. The lights go out and darkness descends. Suddenly, the stage is illuminated, and we jump into The\nBreach, a new play by Naomi Wallace.\nThe story follows Jude and the protective love she\nharbours for her younger brother Acton. We witness\nthe effects of the fallout of a foolish, high-stakes game\nof one-upping that Acton plays with his older friends\nHokeandFraynetoconformwiththeothers.Theshadow of a dark and shameful event beginning to emerge;\nan occurrence so dark that I did feel that at times I had\nto suspend my disbelief that these children, in all their\nnaivety, could have gone through with it.\nThe audience are initially spirited back to 1977\nwhere a conflict between patriotism and the growing\nunease at witnessing the effects of a war in Vietnam has\nfiltered unconsciously through to a generation of children growing up. Throughout the play we flit between\nthis time and 1991 when the grown up children reflect\non their past. Here, The Breach manages to capture the\nsurreal contrast between the harshness of reality and\nthe innocence of the children experiencing it, as they\ngrow to be adults and try to come to terms with newfound guilt and discomfort about their pasts.\nTerrible events are juxtaposed with the banal, representing the oblivious way in which the characters experience such things as children. One striking example is\nwhen Jude and Acton play a game where they imagine\ntheir father thinking about Velveeta on rye bread as he\nfalls through the sky to his death in an unconscious effort to cope with the cruel world their minds aren\u2019t big\nenough to internalise.\nThe script is dotted moments of light and darker\nhumour (risqu\u00e9 jokes about sexual consent), as well as\nsporadic solemnity. The younger Jude is brought to life\nthrough Shannon Tarbet\u2019s fiery and touching portrayal\nthat captures the warring emotions of a girl who must\ngrow up too fast, as she sacrifices herself to protect her\nbrother Acton (Stanley Morgan) from harm and struggles to decide how (and whether) to keep the awkward amorous forays of Hoke (Alfie Jones) and Frayne\n(Charlie Beck) at bay.\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of a set or props, give or\ntake a blanket, an encyclopaedia or two, and Acton\u2019s\nguitar. Such is the way with many modern productions,\nand in this character-focussed play I didn\u2019t mind it too\nmuch. The darkness and minimalism did manage to\ngive a sense of memories being recounted.\nOverall, Wallace does offer us something in The\nBreach, if not through the realism of its plot, then\nthrough the reality of the way it captures the paradox\nof children\u2019s lack of awareness in the grown-up world\nof rape, war, and death happening in the background.\nReviewed by Waleed El-Geresy Arts Writer\nThe Breach\nWhere?

When we say, \u201cwe are\ndetaching from nature,\u201d we mean that\nour homes, lifestyles, and cultures are\nmore and more disconnected from the\nnatural environment, though at least\ncurrently, not from our bodies. We share\nalmost the same blood, muscles, circulatory system, and immune system as\npigs, mice, dogs, and cows. We have the\nprivilege to see the atoms, calculate the\npayoffs in the game theory and send ro-botstoMars,yetwesufferthesamepain,\nsadness, and diseases as all our cousins in\nthe Class Mammalia. As long as we have\nthis mammal body, we are part of nature.\nBut we are challenging this connec-tion. Advancements in medicine have\nmade many fatal diseases such as diphtheria and malaria curable, and there\nare more and more breakthroughs in\nthe treatment of cancer and HIV. It is\nforeseeable that medical advancement\nwill eventually find ways to alleviate the\nharm of most diseases. In the 1900s, human life expectancy across most developing countries was less than 30 years;\nhowever, today, just a century later, new\nbabiesareexpectedtolivelongerthan75\nyears. We were already one of the long-est-living mammals on earth. But we are\nstill asking: can we live longer? Can we\neventually defy some of the most fundamental biological laws (if there are any)\nlike death?\nWe are already breaking the boundaries of biology. Every step in medical\ntechnology could be moving us further\naway from a \u201cnatural\u201d human. Robotic arms, artificial skin, and the recent\nattempt at a pig heart\ntransplant just show\nthe potential for how\nmuch we can change\nourselves. But even\nwithout these tech-nologies, we are already stepping into\na field untouched by\nother organisms. For\nexample, we are more\nand more disconnected from natural\nselection. Certain\npreviously fatal diseases will not prevent\nus from living healthy\nand having offspring,\nand inherited diseases\nwill be greatly alleviated by treatments.\nTheoretically, without excluding harmful genes, the whole\npopulation could be\nmore susceptible to\ndiseases. The ability\nof the immune system could be greatly\nreduced, and people\nwill have to take more\nand more medicine to\nsurvive. Many harm-lessbacterianowadays\ncould be dangerous to future humans\nwithout medical intervention. But what\nif one day (could be a few years later)\nethics change, and germ-line gene editing becomes a reality? We could opti-mise our body\u2019s genes and preserve good\ntraits without undergoing mutation or\nnatural selection.\nThe concept of changing our genes is\nanother huge breach of the foundations\nofbiology.Ifthereistrulysomethinglike\nthe \u201cselfish gene\u201d, and the only meaning\nof \u201cbiology\u201d is to pass down the genes,\nthen what would be the \u201cmeaning\u201d of\nhumans if we start to\nchange our genes\naccording to our fa-vour?\nBiology made us,\nbut biology is increasingly becoming\nour constraint. Our\nbodies are optimised\nto utilise a limited\namount of resources.\nMore than ever be-fore, we are suffering\nfrom an increasing\nnumber of diseases\nbrought on by obe-sity, sedentary life-styles, high fat diets,\nand high sugar in-take. More resources\nare supplied to our\nbody than our body\ncan use\u2014such biological limitations\nconstrain our ability\nto excel beyond our\ntools, tools such as\ncomputers. Within a\nfew decades, humans\ndeveloped supercom-puterstocalculatethe\nweather around the\nglobe, and machine\nlearningtohandlebig\ndata. But relatively slow development is\nseen in the medical field compared with\ninformation technology. The medical\nindustry is constantly trying to develop\nproducts that adapt to the human body,\nbut it is much more difficult to let the\nhuman body adapt to these products.\nThe rate of natural development and\nevolution can hardly keep up with the\ndevelopment rate in human industries.\nWe are experiencing a largely irreversible trend to detach from nature. Perhaps we are becoming a new form of being that is less and less determined by the\nenvironmentbutourownwill.Whenwe\nget used to replacing our hearts, hands,\nand legs with machines, using assistive\ntechnology to help us think, would we\nstart to think \"why do we even need the\nbody at all?\" We are more eager to preserve our thoughts than preserve our\ngenes, so why should we carry heavy reproductive organs that eat our energy?\nIf someday we migrate to some other\ngalaxies, we may have to seriously think\nof a complete split away from biology.\nOne option is to live as files in the disk\nthat can independently think, and more\noptions will certainly become available\nas science and technology advance. But\nno matter whether humans can exist to\nthat day or not, we are growing more\nand more different from our definition\nof \u201cbiology\u201d. Perhaps in the next several hundred years, there could be a new\ndomain of life that sets itself apart from\neukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea if we\nstill recognise ourselves as part of Biology. But perhaps we will not.\nWill humans be excluded\nfrom Biology?\nAs technology advances, there is growing potential to advance beyond the boundaries of our human bodies - but this means we will be breaching biological boundaries.\nWE ARE\nEXPERIENCING\nA LARGELY\nIRREVERSIBLE\nTREND TO\nDETACH FROM\nNATURE.\nPERHAPS WE\nARE BECOMING\nA NEW FORM OF\nBEING THAT IS\nLESS AND LESS\nDETERMINED\nBY THE\nENVIRONMENT\nBUT OUR OWN\nWILL.\n\u201c\nPhoto credits: Warren Umoh on Unsplash\nWhat does gene editing mean for humanity?\nRuntian Wu Science Writer\n\n"

Is there aesthetic value or\na deeper meaning behind these videos, or will it fade\naway like other internet fads? Regardless, a new exhibition at the Design Museum explores the weird and the\nwonderful world of ASMR.\nTheexhibitionbeginsbyoutliningthedifferenttypes\nof ASMR experience. Visual ASMR creations from\nOscar Pettersson\u2019s Rotating Rings or Andreas Wannerstedt\u2019s Slice It Up focus on the visual, often hypnotic,\nASMR experience as opposed to an audio-based one\nmost found online. Some ASMR experience are \u201cunintentional\u201d such as in the work of Bob Ross, the television painter whose show The Joy of Painting brought a\nproto-ASMR experience to millions in the early nine-ties.\nExamples of his art line one of the rooms alongside\na film of the artist at work. The art he produces is not\nbeautiful. For the most part it is kitsch and tacky, unworthy of much cognitive interrogation. But through\nthe act of painting, the delicate monotony of mixing\ncolours,dabbinghisbrushesgentlyinthem,andwiping\npaint onto his canvas, he elicits a meditative sensation.\nI found myself in a trance, as if the afro headed American\u2019s dulcet tones were lulling me into a higher state of\nrelaxation. There is an anti-intellectualism here; audience members are not required to think but rather just\nto feel, not in an emotion sense, but in a physical one.\nIt is this shared feeling, knowing that everyone else\nfeels what you are feeling, that is the foundation of the\nASMR to community. The World of ASMR gives serious critical attention to the phenomenon whilst also\nexploring the culture around it. The emphasis on \u201cdigital intimacy\u201d acts as an antidote to digital alienation,\ndoom scrolling, or social media induced anxiety. This\nis the concept at the heart of Marc Teyssier\u2019s Prototype\nfor Artificial Skin for Mobile Devices. The work consists of a silicone coating, evoking the appearance of venous skin, coating a phone: the phenomenological experience of human skin and human experience in clear\ndialogue with the phone\u2019s hard plastic exterior, but also\nthe ethereal digital world it enables. It is reminiscent of\nDavidCronenbergwhosehorrorfilmVideodromesees\na nightmarish fusing of body and technology. Except\nhere the object is mundane, something that could easily find a way into our lived reality.\nNeedless to say, many of the exhibits are interactive.\nJulie Rose Bower\u2019s ASMR studio invites participants\nto create their own ASMR experiences by interacting\nwith a range of objects linked to headphones to induce\na tingling feeling. But the highlight of the exhibition\nare the works that do not just elicit an ASMR experi-ence, but actively question the nature, and interrogate\nthe consequences of said experience.\nTobias Bradford\u2019s that feeling/immeasurable thirst\nhas the aura of a Dada ready-made both in its physical form and its sense of humour. The work consists of\na silicon tongue rendered in spine chilling detail with\ndribbling saliva and taste buds, powered with a small\nhumming motor to simulate movement. It waggles and\nwriggles; placed at eye level it is almost sexual, inviting\nits viewer for a French kiss, mocking us in its ability to\nmimic us.

The IFS point\nout that high-earning graduates with a\nbalance of \u00a350,000 will incur \u00a33,000 of\nextra debt in just six months, and that\nthis is more than someone earning three\ntimes the median salary would repay\nduring that time. This system amounts\nto the government charging students a\nhigher interest rate than private banks\nare currently charging customers.\nA cap on interest will take effect\nin March 2023, ensuring that the\nabnormally high inflation rates will\napply for a limited time only. The law\ncoming into effect at this point will\nmean that student loan interest cannot\nbe greater than that applied to loans\nsecured from high street banks - the IFS\npredict that this will bring the student\nloan interest rate back down to around\n7%. Changes to the student loans system\nrecently announced mean that for all\ndegrees commencing from the 2023/24\nacademic year, interest rates will mirror\ninflation, with no additional interest\ncharged on top.

Coupled with\nthe effects of low rainfall, it has so far\nclaimed at least 90 lives, resulted in\npower outages, and caused a 10-35%\nreduction in crop yields in agricultural\nstates. The months of March and April\nwere the hottest on record for India and\nPakistan respectively.\n\u201cBecause of climate change, the\nprobability of an event such as that in\n2022 has increased by a factor of about\n30\u201d, says a study published this week by\nthe World Weather Attribution (WWA)\ngroup. WWA is led by a trio which\nincludes Dr Fredi Otto, Senior Lecturer\nat the Grantham Institute, Imperial\nCollege London.\nHeatwaves before the monsoon\nseason are by no means uncommon in\nSouth Asia, but what sets this one apart\nis its early onset, and prolonged nature,\nwhich has devastated the agricultural\nregions in the northwest of India and\nsouth of Pakistan.\nTo arrive at the results, WWA\nscientists combined climate models with\nobservational datasets containing spatial\ntemperature data from 1951 onwards in\nIndia, and 1979 onwards in Pakistan.\nThey compared the current climate with\nahypothetical\u2018pre-industrial\u2019climate.At\npresent, the global mean temperature is\naround1.2\u00b0Cabovepre-industriallevels,\nbut if this figure is to rise as expected,\nevents such as the 2022 heatwave could\nbecome even more likely.\n\u201cThis is a sign of things to come\u201d,\nsaid Prof. Arpita Modal, co-author of\nthe study and a professor of Climate\nStudies at IIT Bombay. Speaking at a\npress briefing, she said, \u201cIn a 2\u00b0C warmer\nworld, what is a one in 100-year event\nnow could become as frequent as a one\nin five-year event\u201d\nExtreme heatwaves have become\nmore frequent across the globe, as a\nresult of human-caused climate change.\nThis most recent heatwave in India and\nPakistan has had wide-reaching effects.\nIn Pakistan, a glacial lake outburst flood\ncausedamajorbridgecollapse.Suchflash\nflooding poses a risk for the more than 7\nmillion people who live downstream. In\nIndia, meanwhile, the heatwave resulted\nin a spike in electricity demand, which\ndepleted the nation\u2019s coal reserves,\ncausing power outages. The effects of\nthe heat are worst for the poorest in the\nnation, who work outdoors and who\nalso lack access to electricity and air-conditioning. Circumstances are set to\nworsen, with the study suggesting that\nthe increasing frequency and intensity\nof heatwaves will cause some regions to\n\u201cexceed limits to human survivability\u201d.\nThe economic fallout of the\nheatwaves extends well beyond South\nAsia and has affected the wider world;\nIndia had been exporting more wheat to\nbolster global supplies, which have been\nseverely reduced by the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, the heatwave has cut wheat\nyields, forcing the government to U-turn\nand implement a ban on wheat exports.\nThe WWA was keen to emphasise\nthe importance of adaptation, stating,\n\u201cWhile some losses will inevitably occur\ndue to the extreme heat, it is misleading\nto assume that the impacts are\ninevitable. Adaptation to extreme heat\ncan be effective at reducing mortality.\u201d It\nspecifically advocated for early warning\nand action plans, alongside improved\nawareness and messaging. India\u2019s rollout\nof these plans, which covers 130 cities\nand towns across the nation, was praised\nas \u201cremarkable\u201d.\nJamie John Science Editor\nThis week in Science...\nResearchers can turn genes on and off using electrical signals\nImperial and QMUL join forces against Parkinson\u2019s\nBiocrusts in the fight against dust\nResearchers have developed a method which allows gene expression to\nbe accurately and precisely controlled through the supply and removal of\nelectrons. This has wide-ranging applications, from biomedical implants\nin the body to reactions in large bioreactors that produce drugs. The\nPsoxS promoter in bacteria was altered to respond more strongly to\nelectrical stimuli, which allows it to activate or repress gene expression.\nThe method was tested using the \u201cglowing\u201d protein from jellyfish and\nelectrons to induce its expression in bacteria, causing the cells to glow\nwhen the system was \u201con\u201d.\nCharcoNeurotech,foundedin2019bythen-ImperialstudentLucyJung,\nwill work with Queen Mary University of London to test its device which\nalleviates the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. The device, called CUE1, can be\nworn on the patient\u2019s chest and delivers localised vibrations which send\nsignalstothenervoussystem,whichpre-clinicaltrialssuggesthelpreduce\nthe symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s. Parkinson\u2019s is an incurable brain disorder\nthatcausesdifficultieswithmovement.Currenttreatmentisbasedaround\ndrugs that can have side effects and whose efficiency can wane over time.\nBiocrusts reduce global dust emissions by 60%, new research suggests.\nBiocrusts are communities of organisms such as fungi, lichens,\nCyanobacteria and other microorganisms which form a \u201cliving skin\u201d in\nthe soil surface of many arid regions. These communities secrete adhesive\ncompounds which stick soil together. They cover around 12% of the\nland\u2019s surface, and are now estimated to prevent around 700 teragrams of\ndust entering the air each year. Dust can carry good nutrients for plants,\nbut can also decrease water and air quality. The researchers looked at\ndata on wind velocities needed to erode dust from different soil types,\nand calculated how biocrust coverage affected dust generation. Wind\nvelocitiesneededtoerodedustfromsoilsshieldedbybiocrustversusbare\nsoils was around 4.8 times greater. However, Biocrusts are in danger, with\nclimate change and land-use shifts predicted to result in biocrust losses\nof 25-40% by 2070.\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nWater on the moon may have come from ancient volcanoes\nSince the existence of ice on the moon was confirmed in 2009, scientists\nhave debated how it got there. New research suggests that 2 billion years\nof volcanic eruptions could have created atmospheres with water vapour\nwhich settled as ice at the poles. When volcanic eruptions were common,\nthey occurred around once every 22,000 years. Based on samples of\nancient lunar magma, researchers found that water constituted around\n\u2153 of the gases released in volcanic eruptions, and from that calculated\nthat eruptions released upward of 20 quadrillion kg of water vapour in\ntotal. Some of this vapour would have been lost to space, but in the cold\npoles,itcouldhavestucktothesurfaceandfrozeintotheiceweseetoday.\nComputersimultionsestimatethataround40%ofthetotaleruptedwater\nvapour could have accumulated as ice. The new calculations also indicate\nthat each new eruption triggered a new atmosphere, which then lingered\nfor around 2,500 years before disappearing until the next eruption.\nFROM IMPERIAL\nLand surface temperatures in India and\nsouthern Pakistan on 29th\nApril 2022\nCredit: European Space Agency, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO.

    "content": "Imperial\u2019s rowing coach, Peter\nHardcastle, did a three-and-a-half-month program where he\ncoached the inmates of Wandsworth\nprison until the end of March.\n\u201cIt was a personal thing, where I\nfelt that I wanted to give a little more\nto the community and\nwanted to do something\ndifferent. I was there for\ntwohourseveryThursday\nmorning, and it was\nreally good. Personally, I\nthink everyone deserves\na second chance. I think\nit\u2019s about giving people\nopportunities, especially\nin areas where they are otherwise\nunavailable, and then people can make\ntheir own decisions. It started with a\nfour-week program, where I would go in\nand give rowing lessons to 12 prisoners.\nAs time went on, and as the program\ngrew, I did two-week rotations, where I\nwould train 12 different prisoners from\na set wing (as you can\u2019t mix wings) over\ntime. I would teach them how to row on\nthe rowing machine, I would give them a\nworkout which they could do, and also\nteach them how to do a relay. After a\nwhile, we came up with the idea to have\na 2km rowing relay challenge between\nsix prisoners and six imperial students.\n\u201cThe actual challenge was really\ngood. The six imperial rowers went\nfirst, followed by the six prisoners. The\natmosphere was electric! The prisoners\nbeattherowersby0.4seconds!\u201d,saysPeter.\nOne of the students describes the\nexperience: \u201cracing in the prison\nwas an amazing experience. There\nwas a great atmosphere of friendly\ncompetition and it was a privilege\ngetting to know all the guys we raced\u201d.\nA large part of the experience was\nthe discussions between the rowers\nand the prisoners. Peter says, \u201cIt was\namazing that all the rowers were really\nhappy talking to all the prisoners. Most\nof the prisoners were on twenty-year\nsentences for drug related stuff, and all\nthe rowers found it fascinating talking to\nthem! Most Imperial students wouldn\u2019t\nnormally mix with prisoners, so it was\nfascinating to them. You could see by\ntheir body language and stories after,\nthey really enjoyed it. This event 100%\nchanged the students\u2019 perspective.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an experience out of the\nordinary for everyone involved\u201d, says\none of the students who attended it.\nT h e\nc o n v e r s a t i o n s\nbetween the\nstudents and the\nprisoners were\nalso very diverse.\nAnother of the\nstudent rowers says,\n\u201cthe opportunity to\nvisit an operational\nprison and compete directly against\nsome of the inmates was a memorable\none. Speaking with some of them before\nthe race, it was interesting to talk about\nthe Open University degrees they are\ntaking and comparing our different\nexperiences of \u2018remote learning\u2019\u201d.\nPeter describes involving the students\nand safety in this event. \u201cEven now,\nrowers have asked me when I will be\nrunning this event again because they\nwould like to be involved. I would love\nto continue involving Imperial Students,\nand it is a very, very safe place. Prisoners\naren\u2019t there to harm people that are\ntrying to help them from the outside\nworld. Really, the only violence there is\nagainst themselves and gangs within the\nprison;theyneverattackthepersonwho\nis giving them gym time, or the rowers\nthat are there to do a competition.\nThey aren\u2019t that type of people.\u201d\nEven though the original challenge\nonly lasted an evening, the prison\ncontinued to run the program and had\ncompetitions between two teams from\neach wing, across eight different wings.\nThe event has kept running till now.\nPeter says the program had big\nbenefits for the prisoners. \u201cI think the\nprisoners also thoroughly enjoyed it. On\na weekly basis, I would walk through\nthe prison, seeing the prisoners in their\ncells, seeing where they ate and played\nsports. Near the end of my challenge\nthere, as we were walking down the\nwing, there were so many prisoners that\nwould be asking about getting back on\nthe rowing machine again and when\nthey could come and get involved; it\nwas so rewarding to see them so happy.\nThe prisoners like a good workout, they\nlike feeling they used their muscles and\nthat they are getting strong. Teaching\nthem how to apply the power through\nthe rowing stroke is really good; there\nare some very strong men in there.\u201d\nThere were some prisoners that\nstood out. \u201cYou would see some very\ninteresting characters in the prison.\nA few were exceptionally strong\nand competent rowers. All the guys\nwere very kind and nice to talk to.\u201d\nThere are some plans to continue this\nopportunity for prisoners to row. \u201cWe\nsort of talked about running it from a\nBritish Rowing challenge, virtually, so\nthat the prisoners could maybe enter\nevents outside the prison and compete\nthatwayaswell.Theprisonersmightnot\nhavethecardiotodoa2kmrace,butthey\nwould manage the 500m with changes,\nlike a relay. It would be really promising\nto have a Wandsworth prison team\ncompetinginthevirtualBritishRowing.\u201d\nWealsoaskedPeterabouthispersonal\nexperience running the program. \u201cIt was\nvery beneficial. I am really glad I did it\nand I\u2019ve got some great memories. For\nthe prisoners, it\u2019s someone volunteering\ntheir time to go in and teach them a skill\nthey\u2019ve never tested. During the first\nweek,theywouldallshakemyhandafter\nthesession.Bythesecondweekandevery\nweek after, they just started coming up\nandgivingmehugs,justforspendingthe\ntime to come in and see them. You really\nsee the appreciation is there because\nthey are very thankful and nice to you.\nThe impact of this program is\nsomething that you won\u2019t know the\neffects of until they are released from\nprison, which could be a few decades.\nHopefully, even if it touches one\nprisoner\u2019s life, so when they leave\nthey take a different direction, that\nwould mean all the world to me.\u201d\nFelix thinks this is incredibly\ncommendable, and something\nthat all Imperial students should\nstrive for: to give back to the\ncommunity and try something new.\nFRIDAY 27TH MAY 2022\n23\nSport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nImperial Rowers take on Wandsworth Prisoners\nAmanda Barden Sport Editor\nPeter Hardcastle Imperial\u2019s Rowing Coach\nEdited by: Amanda Barden\nKonrad Hohendorf\nSport\nPeter Hardcastle with Imperial rowers outside Wandsworth Prison\n\u201c\nTHE\nATMOSPHERE\nWAS ELECTRIC!\n\n"
