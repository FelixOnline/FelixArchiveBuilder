    "content": "Caving\nNYLON\nHIGHWAY\nExperience the ups and downs of the\n1 994 IC Caving Expedition with Robert Rea\nEarlier this summer, the college caving club\norganised a six week expedition of twenty people to the Julian Alps in the former Yugoslav\nrepublic of Slovenia.\nThe high alpine Limestone or Karst in\nthe Julian Alps has already proved fruitful in\nthe discovery of deep systems, boasting the\nrecently discovered Ceki 2, the forth deepest\ncave in the world at -1342m(4403 ft). Months prior to leaving Britain, several contacts were made with local caving clubs in\nSlovenia. This resulted in the club being given\na high mountain plateau to explore by\nthe Tolmin Caving Club.\nSome logistical problems had to\nbe overcome in moving people and two\nminibus loads of caving gear, rope,\nfood and so on from the lower base\ncamp in the village of Tolminski Ravne\nat an altitude of 900m(2953 ft) up to\nthe high b iv vy at 1900m(6223f t).I will never forget carrying 200m of rope\nwith two tackle sacks hanging off the\nrear of my rucksack up a forest path\nand then traversing the southern face of\nMount Migovec on an old disused goat\nherders' path and making the final\npush up across the limestone pave-ment, riddled with huge shake holes\nand loose boulders (oh, those loose\nboulders) then finally reaching the\nBivvy two to three hours after setting\noff. After dumping my gear, having a brew and a tin of tuna, I set off again\non an eight hour jigging trip to install\nthe rope and extend the cave by another 130m vertically.\nThe principle aim of the trip was\nto prospect for, explore and survey new\ncaves in the Migovec area. Initially, some\nmembers began systematically searching the\nplateau, \"dropping holes\" in search of the elusive master system which underlies the\nMigovec plateau. At the same time, another\nteam rigged the already known cave Ml6 down to the gigantic chamber Galactica at\n-473m(1552 ft). The cave was mainly vertical\nwith a series of \"pitches\" descending up to\n70m(230 ft) in one drop, followed by short\npassages and large airy chambers.\nIn total, the expedition extended three\nknown caves in area. Ml 7, which was a massive cylindrical shaft filled with snow and solid\nice was pushed from -50m to -95m. M11,\nanother snow and ice choked hole was extended from -30m to -63m. Several new passages\nwere also found extending the Ml6 system.\nThree new major caves were found.\n\"Bullshit Pot\", named after the wildly exaggerated stories coming from its discoverers, was a very loose system pushed to -80m. \"Brezno\nKratce Majce\" or Torn T shirt cave was a very\ntight rift, (hence the name) winding its way\ndown to -80m. The third and deepest system found was\nWhite Shiver cave, another huge abyss almost\ncompletely filled by an enormous snow/ice\nplug. Iain McKenna and myself pushed this\ncave to its end, which was an almost magical\nexperience which I will never forget.\nOnce the entrance snow plug was\npassed, the cave opened out: into a large snow\nslope terminating in a60m long almost fairy\nlike cavern at -99.2m. Huge icicles decorated\nthe roof, one as thick as a tree trunk, while an\nice, waterfall clung to one wall seemingly\nfrozen in time. Every surface was enveloped in\na thin layer of clear ice which glistened when\ncaught, by our head lamp beams. Tiny ice crystals sent aloft by our movements created a sparkling mist to cap it all. But danger lurked\neverywhere in this crystal grotto, particularly\nthe loose rock which at. one point, partly gave\nway beneath my feet. The 3m long icicles were\nvery precarious, ready to crash down and\npotentially impale the unsuspecting\ncave r. Life at the high b iv vy grew on\nyou. Two day stints at the top stretched\ninto six days stretches or until you just\nsmelt too bad. Water was obtained by\nmelting snow from cave entrances,\nalthough the frequent and violent thunderstorms quickly filled our water containers with marble sized hailstones.\nThese proved quite dangerous in a number of ways, from threatening to\nflatten our tents and flood the caves, to\ngetting struck by lightning - as ten\nfatalities a year in the area proves. I'm glad that I wasn't the one to have to\ncarry up the stick of dynamite that the\nlocal caving club gave us.\nThis years' expedition achieved a great deal in extending and discovering\nseveral major caves. Much experience\nwas gained by all members of the team\nin a variety of ways and good relations\nwere made with the local cavers to\nenable us to return to the area next,\nyear. We would like to thank the\nRectors trust, Exploration Board, IC\ntrust, Harlington trust and the Char Parau\nfoundation lor their support. Thanks also to\nour patron Dr Tony Waltham, one of the\nworlds top cavers and an ex-IC Caving Club\npresident. Thank you also to Spring Foods Ltd\nfor their donation of flapjacks \u2014 the ideal cave\nfood, 500 Kcal in one tiny bar!

The main band of the\nevening, Salad, were playing\nwhen it became apparent that\nabout thirty mosher s dancing at\nthe front were starting to impinge\nonto the stage. Two union stewards tried to regain some measure\nof control but it became apparent\nthat they were insufficient. Several\nminutes later more stewards\nwhich will take place in London,\naims to attract 10,000 people. In\nan open letter, ULU President\nGemma Williams stated her intention to \"rid London of its pitiful\nreputation for attendance at such\nevents.\"\nMany Colleges are organising\nevents such as hardship discos to\ntake place in the fortnight leading\nup to the event.\nto devote to DramSoc.

This caused a crowd surge\nresulting in several stewards being\npushed over onto the stage. In the\nconfusion one member of the\naudience managed to grab the\nfront, of the singer's trousers.\nOrder was quickly regained and\nSalad managed to finish their\nencore. The rest of the New Year's Carnival passed off smoothly.\nGreen Research\nA Graduate School of the\nEnvironment is to be formed at\nImperial College. The formation\nof the new School was recommended in a review conducted by\nSir John Mason into how the\nCollege might best coordinate-ordinate its activities and strength\nin the fields of environmental sci-en ce, engineering and technology.\nThe Rector accepted the recommendation and steps are currently\nbeing taken in order to implement\nthe decision.\nThe School will be the first\nGraduate School at Imperial\nCollege and its relationship with\nacademic departments will largely\nbe one of coordination and opening up of opportunities.\nMedical Merger\nA new plan may see King's College\nmerging with United Medical\nSchools of St. Guys and St.\nThomas'.\nThe proposal has been\napproved by the governing body\nof King's College, and is awaiting\nthe Government's decision which\nshould arrive in January.

As part of an\nAcademy-funded scheme, five\nsenior industrial engineers will\nbecome 'visiting professors in the\nprinciples of engineering design'\nat Imperial College.

    "content": "Feature\nProms '94 new music disc roundup\nJfPd stayed sitting on that pew for another 30 seconds my buttock\nfossilized.' Patrick Wood takes a hot bath with John Tavener, and\ncirculation restored by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies\nWhy don't, people write like Beethoven any-more? A common complaint from the many\nwhose musical enthusiasm withers in the face of\nanything written after about 1900. The answer\nis twofold. Firstly, modern composers X and Y are surely not unaware of the short-term\nadvantages of writing music that, makes people\nthink, 'Hey, that sounds like Beethoven.'\nHowever, they'd much rather have posterity\nlisten to their work and think, 'Hey, that,\nsounds like X( or Y).' This is why modern music\noften sounds weird. Secondly, musicians nowadays are surrounded by so much music, live,\nbroadcast and recorded, in so many different\nstyles. Hence a composer who has what: he\nthinks is a good idea and writes it down\nbecomes, after familiarizing himself with it,\nunsure of whether the idea is genuinely his or\nwhether it's something dredged up from his\nsubconscious memory. This is why modern\nmusic contains few 'tunes' in the traditional\nsense.\nOne of the most recognizable and challenging of contemporary voices belongs to Sir\nHarrison Birtwistle. His Earth Dances,\nplayed by the Cleveland Orchestra at this year's Proms, is a huge orchestral mechanism of\ngrinding brass and clockwork percussion. It's a thrilling and sometimes baffling piece, full of\nstartling and evocative so nori ties, and is available from Collins Classics, who have also just\nreleased Birtwistle's latest large-scale work,\nAntiphonies for piano and orchestra. The new\npiece (coupled with the much earlier Noinos\nand An Imaginary Landscape) doesn't have the\ndepth and spaciousness of Earth Dances; the\nrelentless pecking of percussion and solo piano\nsoon becomes tiring.\nA composer who shares Birtwistle's fascination with ritual is John Tavener, although his\nstatic, devotional musical language is very differ-ent. Tavener's two-hour cantata The, Apocalypse\nwas premiered at the Proms a lew months back,\nand another substantial choral work, Akathist of\nThanksgiving, has recently been released by\nSony Classical. It. was recorded live at a conceit\nin Westminster Abbey last January (a faint rumble is occasionally just audible in the background)\nand at the time the publicity proudly announced\nthat at. its one previous performance, also in the\nAbbey, the Aka this t had received a standing ova-tion. So too did it this time round, and being\nthere I knew why. At, least:, I knew why it. received\na standing ovation from me, which was because\nif I'd stayed sitting on that pew for another 30\nseconds my buttocks would have fossilized. It's long, 78 minutes even with a cut, and just\nsqueezes onto one CD. The\nadvantage of a recording is not\njust that you can listen in the comfort of an armchair. Jhe composer\nwould say I 've missed the point,\nbut this is the musical equivalent\nof a hot bath: you'll want to dip\ninto it. rr ii e climax is a long time\narriving, and when it does (track\n8), it's brief but glorious.\nMuch shorter and denser is\nSudden Time by George\nBenjamin, new on a15 minute\nCD single from Nimbus. The\nwork is fragmentary and minutely crafted, but, seems to lose\ndirection after the promising first\nfive minutes, and leaves no lasting impression. This is certainly\nnot a problem faced by MarkAnthony Turnage. Born in\n1960, the same year as\nBenjamin, he has just finished a four-year residency with the City\nof Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, who play four of his works\nunder the direction of Sir Simon\nRattle on a recent release from\nEMI. Turnage mixes jazz influences into his\nhighly-coloured orchestral palette: saxophones\nstrut on with bold tunes, and more than once\nan electric guitar underpins the bass-line. The\nopening work, Drowned Out, was inspired by\nWilliam Golding's novel Pincher Martin, about\na sailor swept overboard. The tidal pull of a deep, strong cello melody tugs the listener into\nthe sensational opening pages, and the music\nreturns to a similar plane, after the less memo-r able, Rile of Springs ty h chugging central sec-tion. The rest of the disc is equally inspired and\napproachable.\nThe same can also be said about pails of\na new Sony Classical disc of music by the late\nPolish composer Witold Lutoslawski, played\nby the Eos Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra\nconducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. A rich and\ntonal pulsing opens his recent Fourth\nSymphony, and while it's not all such easy lis-ten ing, it only takes a few hearings for the work\nto begin to reveal its structure. The more elusive Third Symphony also ends beautifully, but\nthe best parts of the disc are the gorgeous fifth\nand sixth verses of Les Espaces du sommeil\n(track 2, 5'28\"), a haunting nocturnal passage\nof sparkling woodwind flurries and swooning\nstring glissandi.\nI taunting in a more literal sense describes\nMaxwellDaeies in the SOs (Photo: LIVT/CliesleiMusic)\nSir Peter Maxwell Davics' The Lighthouse.\nThis 70-minute opera is based on the unexplained disappearance of three keepers from a lighthouse in the Outer Hebrides in 1900. The\nmaterial is sometimes thinly stretched, and the\nPrologue drags, but the atmosphere builds\nsteadily to a powerful and eerie climax from\n17'20\" in track 5. The disc is from Collins, who\nalready have a large selection of works by\nDavies in their catalogue. An extract from The\nLighthouse features on their half-price sampler\ndisc 'Maximum Max', which ends with the\nwonderful Orkney Wedding with Sunrise, in\nitself worth the price of admission. No-one with\na drop of Celtic blood in their veins can fail to\nbe roused by the bagpipe-led closing pages.\nBest of all though is the Collins recording of\nDavies' magnificent Third Symphony. His style\nin this hour-long, four movement work is\nuncompromising and subtle; no batteries of\nextrovert percussion here. Rather, the colours\nand textures are those of moss and lichen on\nweathered granite. The structure is faultlessly\nplotted, each movement reaching an eloquent\nclimax in its final bars: try track 2 from 6'56\".\nThe, symphony seems to chart an elemental\njourney, taken perhaps by a modern Bruckner\nalong remote and craggy coastal paths. It's a work to come back to and explore many times.\n01CT91 FELIX WM\n\n"

This\ndocument, in whatever form it is\nfinally passed, will be the fundamental document on which our\nUnion conducts its affairs. This is\nprobably the, most far reaching rewrite that it has had in recent\ntimes and builds on the experiences of the, last, two years. This\nversion of the constitution has\nbeen written over the summer\nwith significant College input\nbefore being agreed with our\ncurrent Executive Committee.\nWhat are these changes?\nThis is the main purpose of this\narticle, to explain what, some of the\nlargest changes are and the\nconcepts behind them. Many of\nthe changes have been made\nnecessary by the new Education\nAct, some by consultation with\nCollege and many initiated by\nmembers of the Union themselves.\nThe SRC\nThe Student Representative\nCouncil has been designed to be\nthe policy making body of IC\nUnion. In fulfil ing this role it\nreplaces the Union General\nMeeting (UGM) of the old\nconstitution. UGM's are notoriously vulnerable to groups of\npeople turning up and block\nvoting issues through which could\nbe against, the interests of the rest,\nof the membership. It was felt that\nthe introduction of the, SRC would\nprovide greater democracy.\nFundamentally it is not unlike\nthe UGM in that any student can\nattend and have their say in the\nrunning of the Union. In order to\ncounter the problem of block\nvoting it has a core of around fifty\nThe. three office sabbaticals would\nlike to thank:\nMandy: The day before our\nfirst function in Da Vinci's the\nceiling came down due to a large\nleak in the, heating system. Whilst\nthe, rest of us were panicking\nMandy (our Union Manager) got,\nthe ceiling replaced in a little over\n24 hours.\nSam: Sam has worked\ntirelessly organising the various\nevents in the Union this week and\ndeserves a huge pat on the, back.\nMichelle & Adele:\nThroughout, this week Michelle\nand Adele have managed to stay\non top of things all AND be\nreasonably relaxed with it!\nEveryone Else! What has\nimpressed us as newcomers to the\noffice is the, way everybody,\nwithout, exception, pulls together.\nOne final mention for Ian and\nhis organisation of Freshers Fair\nWell played mate!\npeople who are the only voting\nmembers. These are all elected\nrepresentatives of different areas of\nthe Union thus insuring that as\nwide a variety of views as possible\nare, represented at, the SRC.\nHowever, in order to ensure\nthe SRC is accountable to the\nstudent body an Extraordinary\nGeneral Meetings can be called at\nany time. The work of the SRC is\nalso reviewed by an Annual\nGeneral Meeting at the end of the\nyear.\nThe composition of the SRC is\nstill under debate, with one of the\nliveliest issues likely to be wether\nor not it should include a representative from each hall.\nThose in favour of their inclusion\nbelieve that this will increase the\nparticipation of first year students\nin the Union. Those against their\ninclusion believe that some of these\nHall Reps arc, unlikely to regularly\nattend meetings leading to\nproblems in achieving quorum\n(the number of people needed\nbefore a meeting may open). It is\nalso felt that it may be unfair to a greater representation to those\nwho live in hall.\nThe Executive Committee\n(Exec)\nThis committee is intended to\ncoordinate the management of the\nUnion and as such it. is not a representative body. It, is designed\nas a committee composed of\npeople interested in the running of\nthe, Union who have already been\nelected by the membership to\nspecific posts. It is proposed that it\nshould consist of the President,\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties), Deputy President,\n(Finance & Services), the President, of each Constituent College,\nUnion and four other Union\nOfficers elected at SRC. This\ncomposition is similar to the old\nExec except for the four extra\nUnion Officers who have been\nbought on to increase the breadth\nof expertise of its members.\nFinancial Regulations\nDuring consultation with College it,\nbecame clear that our Financial\nRegulations needed to be looked at\nespecially in the light of the new\nEducation Act, which sets out\nspecific requirements for the\noperation of, reporting on and\naccountability for students' union\nfinances. Some aspects of the\nresulting new financial responsibilities and procedures are\noutlined in the constitution and are\nthen dealt with more thoroughly in\nthe Appendices.\nIn rewriting parts of these,\nregulations we, have attempted to\nmake the Union more accountable\nto the students through form-a lising the publication of regular\nfinancial reports (in accordance\nwith the Act). A large amount of\neffort also went into more clearly\ndefining chains of financial\nresponsibility within the Union\nand consequently the role of\nvarious committees within the\nUnion's Finances.\nThese three issues are the\nmain areas where the, constitution\nhas been significantly altered,\nhowever their are many other\nsmall changes which we will be\nhappy to discuss with you at, any\ntime.\nSo, what can you do about it?\nFirstly, come and have a look at a copy. Sitting down and reading a copy is by far the quickest, way of\nfinding out what, the constitution is\nactually about. Copies are\navailable to any student at the\nUnion Office.\nSecondly, come and talk to\nus. If anyone, is unhappy with any\nof the points we have raised or\nrequires more information on\nanything else in this proposed\nconstitution please, come in for a chat about it. It is vital that the\nconstitution that is passed by the\nUnion is right, for the students of\nImperial College.\nThirdly, have your say. This\nconstitution goes to its first Union\nGeneral Meeting on Friday 14th October at, 12.00pm( Ents\nLounge). Being there is probably\nthe easiest, way you can have a say\nas to the direction our Union takes\nin the future. There will be a limited amount of time at this\nmeeting, so in order to have your\npoints considered fully please try\nand discuss them with us first.See\nyou all soon...\nLucy, Ian & Dan\n010CT94 FELIX "

    "content": "Feature\nApproaching the size of a cow\n1 J.C7 The union constitution\nhas been a battle ground,\nfought over for many\nyears. Jon Jordan looks at\nits history and the state of\nthe current debate.\nThe present chapter in the Union constitution's story started in 1993 when the then Union\npresident, Chris Davidson, put forward a proposal for the restructuring of the Union. This\nbroadly attempted to shift power from Union\nGeneral Meetings (UGMs) and the over 50\nstrong Council to a more streamlined Executive\ncommittee made up of 13 members. Although\nthere was some concern expressed at the time\nby students about the demise of UGMs, the socalled 'Davidson Reforms' were passed by a UGM on the last day of the summer term in 1993.\nUnder the helm of the next Union\npresident, Andrew Wensley, the 'Davidson\nReforms' were passed, with amendments, by the\nfirst UGM of the following autumn term. To\nbecome official policy the reforms just needed to\nbe ratified by the College's Governing Body. That\nstep was never completed and the whole process\nended in some confusion at the end of the last\nsummer term with the Union having to revert back\nto operating under the old, pre-Davidson\nconstitution.\nSo to the present situation. Once again the\nUnion finds itself in the situation of wanting to get\na new constitution passed. The constitution which\nis currently being proposed was written over the\nsummer by the new sabbatical officers with\n\"significant College input\". Briefly, like the\n'Davidson Reforms', it seeks to replace Council\nwith a more streamlined structure. In particular a new organ, the Student Representative Council\n(SRC) has been proposed to replace Council with\nthe old Executive committee being enlarged and\nempowered to carry out the weekly running of the\nUnion. [For more details see the article written by\nthe sabbaticals on p.17 in this issue of FELIX.] Before this constitution becomes official, it\nmust be passed by two UGMs and then ratified by\nthe Governing Body. The first of those three steps\nmay occur next Friday, 14th October in the first\nUGM of term. There, the new constitution will be\ndiscussed for the first time before being voted on.\nCopies of the new constitution can be picked up\nfrom the Union office.\nFOR\nThe arguments for the new constitution haven't really changed since Chris Davidson started the\nwhole process off in 1993. Almost everyone\ninvolved with the Union agrees that, the 55\nmember Council is both too large and\nunwieldy, making it practically impossible to\nform any consensus on important issues. As it\nonly meets once a month Council can not react\nto any immediate events which need to be\ndiscussed either.\nAnother related problem concerns the\nUnion General Meetings (UGMs). They are\nseen as being vulnerable to special interest\ngroups who block vote. This was particularly\nevident in October 1993 when the 'Davidson\nReforms' were passed for the second time.\nBecause the proposed changes were seen as\nbeing detrimental to the power of the\nthree South Kensington\nConstituent College\nUnions (CCUs) they\nput forward an\namendment, to the\nnew constitution\nand then block\nvoted it through\nthe UGM. In order\nto guard against such\nbehaviour a Student\nRepresentative Council (SRC)\nhas been proposed. This will replace UGMs as\n\"the governing and sovereign body of the\nUnion\" and provide greater democracy.\nThe SRC will made up of 55 members,\nranging from the Union officers to academic\nand hall representatives and thus will be more\nrepresentative of student views compared to the\n'hack ridden' UGMs. As the sabbaticals\ncomment; \"fundamentally it [the SRC] is not\nunlike the UGM in that any student can attend\nand have their say in the running of the Union\".\nThe other bit of the new structure\nconcerns the enlargement of the Executive\ncommittee. This will grown from 7 to 11\nmembers, meet at least fortnightly and thus be\nsmall enough to carry out the running of the\nUnion in a way that the old Council could not.\nIn summary, the arguments for the new\nconstitution are that it is more flexible and\nrepresentative of students' views than the\npresent one.\nAGAINST With this summary in mind it. is interesting that\nthe arguments against the new constitution are\nthe exact opposite i.e. it is less representative\nthan the old as it, effectively concentrates power\nin the hands of the 11 strong Executive\ncommittee and removes the only forum of real\ndemocratic power, the UGM.\nThe fact that UGMs are vulnerable to\nblock voting is not new, so why is it so\nimportant now? One reason is that over the last\nyear the attendance at UGMs became an\nembarrassment. For a Union with over 7000\nmembers UGM attendances of under 100\nsuggests that there is a deep disillusionment,\namongst students concerning the Union in\ngeneral. Block voting is a symptom of the\nproblem not the cause. The fact that the Union\ncan't, get students to attend UGMs\ndoesn't not seem to be a sufficient, reason to do\naway with them all\ntogether. When the\nsabbaticals say,\n\"fundamentally it,\n[the SRC] is not\nunlike the UGM in\nthat any student can\nattend and have their\nsay in the running of the\nUnion\", they totally ignore the\nfact that students can only vote in UGMs.\nAnother connected problem is that the 11\nmembers of the Executive committee could\nwield considerable power as they also make up\nthe core of the SRC. Although the bulk of this\ncommittee is made up of academic reps (17)\nand hall reps (15) it. seems likely that the Union\nofficers could dominate proceedings.\nAlternatively, die SRC could become just as\nunwieldy as the old Council was. It is interesting\nto note that the 'Davidson Reforms' tried to get\nrid of Council because its size whereas the new\nconstitution actually gives the SRC, a body of\nthe same size, far more power than it. previously\nhad.\nWhatever your opinion the main thing is\nto have one. You can get a copy of the\nconstitution from the Union office and talk to\nany of the sab hs about it. Remember if you don't turn up and vote, you are allowing yourself to be\nrepresented by those who do.\nFELIX mora "

It was the birth of the\nmachine age, the birth of horror\nand of truth. It heralded the death\nof innocence, of peace of mind and\nof the millions whose lives were\nsenselessly wasted in carnage. To\nexpress the sickening scale of the\ndestruction of that time is a difficult\ntask indeed, but one that has been\nmanaged admirably in the new\nexhibition, A Bitter Truth at the\nBarbican. With over two hundred\npaintings, prints and sculptures on\ndisplay it takes you through the\ntime of the war, from the initial\npugilistic enthusiasm of the artists\nand the populace to the\ndisillusionment, despair and mental\ndamage of the aftermath. Many\nwell known painters are on display\nfrom Britain and Germany, most\nnotably the bleak, angular\nlandscapes of Nash, but many\nlesser known artists provide\noutstanding works from that time.\nThe path of the exhibition takes\nyou through the time of the war to\ngive an understanding of the\nchanges that took place in the\nconflict and the attitudes of the\nartists. Before the start of the\nfighting, the Futurists glorified\nbattle as the only way of producing\naesthetic excellence, but by the end\nmany previously abstract artists had\nturned to realism in order to\nexpress their horror at the scenes\naround them. The greatest insight\nwas provided by various paintings\nby Otto Dix. In 1914, a self portrait\nshowed him eager for blood, strong\nand determined. Later he\nrepresented himself in his 'Portrait\nas a shooting target'. In 1924, his\ndrawings became filled with\ndecomposition, collapse and death,\nas he attempted to comprehend the\npast in the only way he could.\nThis exhibition is intense, dark\nand disturbing; but it is also deeply\nnecessary, and provides a remarkable insight into events\nwhich few today can remember first\nhand. It does not deserve to be\nmissed.\nsee diary for de fails Whereas the only other Japanese\nband of note, Shonen Knife,\nmanage not to play their\ninstruments, but be endearing and\nproduce jap-pop, the Boredoms\ntrash their instruments, bemuse\npeople and produce jap-core.\nHeavily fuelled by their\nSiamese twins bashing away on\noutside drum kits, the Boredom\nrollercoaster is directed by a lead\nvocalist who obviously took\nlessons from the Rollins school of\nshouting. He was probably a extra\nin Karate Kid too, considering his\npropensity to jump off loudspeaker\nstacks in the crane position, to the\naccompaniment of crashing\ndrums. On occasions in the set\none drummer sacrificed her\ncrashing to shriek on a trumpet,\nthe third drummer-cum-wail er sometimes pretended to have\nappendicitis; yeah the Boredoms\nare a heady mix of that all that is\nunpredictable..\nAs for old bands with new\nthings to say, there are few with\nthe lineage of Bob Mould. From\nHusker DO to solo Mould and the\ncurrently ironic 'file under easy\nlistening' Sugar, he has borne the\nbrunt of a rock'n 'roll lifestyle and\nstill come out smiling.\nLive, Sugar know exactly\nwhat steps they have to take and\nproceed to take them all with\nrunning strides. Melodies go the\nway of all speed with Bob a clumsy\nfigure wheeling around the stage\nunder the direction of Malcolm\nTravis' stinging bass. Even the old\nfavourites from 'Copper Blue' were\nmixed with a live vigour that\nreinvented them. 'Changes' was\nalmost over before I realised what\nit was and the supposedly 'radio\nfriendly unit shifting' 'if I can't change your mind' came out as a blazing shade of noise. Two\nencores ending on 'walking away'\nand the only words Bob said were\n'goodnight'. Outside it was raining\nand October but that night our\ndreams were vivid.\nQ \u00ae sparks and spangles Anoraks, trousers flapping 3\" above\nthe ankle, sandals and overgrown\nbeards - these are regular, heart\nwarming sights at IC, London. For\nthe really fashion conscious, there\nare rugby shirts, shoulder pads, pale\njeans and pony tails. After two years\nat IC, the nagging thought that\none's surrounding tend to influence\none's dress sense has developed\ninto full scale terror. Thus, out of\nfear for the future of my street c red., here it is - a last brave attempt to\nturn the tide, wage war on\nacademia, and bring to you the\nFELIX Fashion File: a definite guide\nto London Streetware. Will you\ncontinue wearing pale green skirts\nwith scarlet tights and Court shoes\n(boys!) or will you turn to the new,\nslick, individual styles of the 90s? And for the conservatives, don't fear.\nGrey is the fashionable colour this\nseason. Bring back from your attics\nthe old school tank top and tie, then\nnip down to my recommended\nplaces and put a ring through your\neyebrow. Easy.\nOnce arrayed in your new-look\nattire, choose from a sparkling list of\nfashionable 'nite-spots' and prepare\nto hit the town. Each review will\nincluded the best ways to get there,\nprices on the door and at the bar,\nwhich doorman is hardest to impress\nand the best shops for home time munchies.\nThis column is intended to give\nsome pointers to the opportunities\nof London shopping and living\n(obviously the same thing). Forced\ninto this varied and fascinating city\nfor at least three years, many\nstudents never really seem to\nappreciate the richness of their\nsurroundings. As a complete sad\nLondon fanatic, this is my poor\nexcuse to run round the city\nspending a student loan and then\ndrivel on enthusiastically each week.\nSo arrange your overdrafts, trim\ndown your beards, get out the silver\nlycra and enjoy.\n010CT94 FELIX "

    "content": "Feature\nCan you be all at sea at IC?\nYes, you can, as the Imperial College Yacht Club prove every\nweekend. All is explained in this tale of vigour and salty vomit.\nIt is said (allegedly) that Imperial College Yacht\nClub (ICYC) was formed 5 years ago by a group of sailors who wanted boats with beds\nthat, provided a cheap way of getting to and\nfrom French hypermarket s and pubs in Cowes.\nSome things don't change. However, since\nthose modest beginnings the club has expanded\nrapidly, introducing many students to yachting,\nboth cruising and racing. The club has\ncompeted internationally in the Spi-Dauphine,\nCroisiere EDHEC, Jet Sea Cup, Harnble Winter\nSeries and, most importantly, the British\nUniversity Nationals. In addition, the club\norganises very cheap tuition aimed\ntowards passing the RYA\nYachtmaster exams, both theory\nand practical, which upon leaving\nImperial and getting rich (?!)\nenables you to charter yachts\nanywhere in the world!!\nThe club has a full schedule\nfor this term, with racing, cruising\nand/or training on offer every weekend. Racing\nfreaks can look forward to the complete\nHamble River Winter Series this term and an\ninternational regatta or two next term (how\ndoes a week in the Caribbean over Easter\nsound!!). There are 30 yacht-days worth of\ncruising and RYA practical training in the\nSolent area spread over 8 weekends in October\nand November alone. And of course, the, RYA\ntheoretical course and exam for Yachtmaster\ntheory takes place on the weekends of Nov. 26-27, Dec. 3-4, and 10-11. All of this amounts to\na grand total of well over 400 full student-days\nworth of activities.\nSo, what happens on one of these\nyachting weekends?? Well, if there is such a thing as a typical ICYC weekend, it, would go\nlike this....\nOn Saturday morning the club meets at\n7am at the car park entrance between the Post\nOffice and Civ Eng. on Prince's Gate. Once\neveryone's woken up and got over the shock of\ndiscovering weekend mornings do exist, (and\nthat, they're even worse than weekday ones), its\noff in the minibus, first stop the Tesco garage in\nBarnes to buy food (and lots of coffee), and\nthen onto Port Solent in Portsmouth. On\narrival, everything's loaded onto the yachts and\nthen, after a read through of the skipper's and\ncrew's safety notes, it's through the lock, motor\nout the harbour and hoist, the sails. The first,\nfew hours are generally spent, working on\nsailing skills, safety routines, cruising, admiring\nthe scenery and making sure everyone can use\nthe heads (the toilet, don chak now) without\nsinking the boat, while the late afternoon is\ndevoted to a match race between the ICYC\nyachts (the result of which decides which crew\nbuys the first, rounds of drinks). As it gets dark\nthe yachts enter the luxurious surrounds of the\nnewly developed Cowes Yacht Haven.\nSaturday night is party night, whether\nit's squeezing into \"The Anchor\", drinking real\nbeer and listening to ever more outrageous\nyachting tales along the lines of \"..we hit 30\nknots in Hurricane Herbert on the 2nd leg of\nthe '88 Whitbread, upside down and stern\nfirst....spilt, me bloody coffee too!\", or pizza,\nlager and playing pool in \"The Harbour\nLights\". Young \"Cambridge /\nOxford reject\" fogeys could\neven head for an evening of\nport and cigars at Cowes\nYacht Club, provided you've\ngot the right blazer, cravat,\nand a friendly bank manager.\nOn Sunday morning\nyou will wake to the gentle\nlapping of waves on the hull and the suffocating\nsmoke of an ICYC special cooked breakfast in\nthe making. This guarantees a rush to be above\ndeck and generally ensures we're out of Cowes\nwith the sails up by 8am( personally, I'm a fan\nof cooking and eating breakfast once out at sea:\nit's fun watching someone trying to balance\npots and pans as you gybe, and it's not such a faux pas to throw up at, open sea as it is in a crowded marina). The race crew will probably\nhead off on their own to air their egos and get\n\"...on the way\nback to London\nand the only\nperson likely to\nbe awake being\nthe driver (we\nhope).\"\n\"I'm a fan of\ncooking and\neating breakfast\nonce out at sea\"\nto the start line,\nwhile the other\nyacht(s) will go\noff on a long\ncruise (checking\nout areas such\nas the Needles\nand the forts)\nand do some\nRYA practical training. Sunday evening and the\nyachts all meet, up back at Port Solent, to\nunload and head back to London. After all that\nfresh air the minibus resembles a dormitory on\nwheels on the way back to London and the\nonly person likely to be awake is the driver (we\nhope).\nAnd so, to the most important question:\n\"How much does all this cost??\". An incredible\n25 squids per weekend is the answer (plus \u00a310\nannual membership for UG's and \u00a315 for PG's and staff). All costs are included except\nSaturday dinner and booze. Nothing extra to\nspend on transport, nothing extra on lunches or\nSunday breakfast, nothing extra on moorings,\nand nothing extra for the hire of the beautiful\nSUNFAST 36' yachts.\nIjyou're tempted to find out more, come\nand sea (sic) us al our regular meetings on\nThursdays at l pm in Physics lecture theatre 2,\nor leave a message on the ICYC answer phone\nvia the Union on 48060, or a. duy ck@ ic.ac.uk!!\nJim Cannon (ICYC Chairman).\nMM FELIX010 CI91 "

    "content": "sp\nELIXft\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College N0IO O607 OCT94 Informed\nSilence\nBY DAVID COHEN\nIt emerged this week that St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nappears to be at the centre of a financial scandal. Last weekend\nthe Mail on Sunday reported\nabout a \"hospital cashier who\ngambled away \u00a3650,000 of stolen\nmoney\". The cashier, Mr Cyril\nD 'Souza, is alleged to have embezzled monies over the past 12 years.\nSt Mary's has been part of\nImperial since 1988, and over the\npast few years has been progressively integrated into the Imperial\nsystem. Recently an internal financial audit was completed at St\nMary's and irregularities were\nfound. Apparently, three weeks\nago, Mr Cyril D 'Souza, a cashier at\nthe medical school, was called in\nto see St Mary's managers. He is\nsaid to have confessed to theft\namounting to \u00a3652,840.58. Mr\nD 'Souza refused to comment to\nFELIX. However last week the\nMail on Sunday quoted him as\nsaying \"I suppose you could say I was gambling crazy\".\nAccording to the Mail on\nSunday's investigations Mr\nD 'Souza lives in an ex-council flat,\nvalued now at around \u00a330,000 so\nit seems that he would be able to\nrepay only a minute fraction of the\nstolen money. It has all been lost\non gambling flings, allegedly. But,\nsources have revealed to FELIX that Imperial College might\nattempt to make an insurance\nclaim against an employee fraud\ninsurance policy which covers the\nCollege against such situations. At\nthe moment College management\nare unwilling to comment.\nWhen interviewed by FELIX Mr Angus Fraser, Managing\nDirector of Imperial College, said\nthat \"No member of the College\nwill comment on the case... and I am not going to comment either\non any point, in the article [in The\nMail on Sunday]\". He added that\nno further information will be\nreleased until the Police investigation comes to a conclusion. The\nCollege Executive Committee\nmeets today (Friday) when the\nremaining governors who are not\naware of the situation may be\ninformed.\nThe prudence with which\nImperial College management, is\nhandling this case is note worthy\nas absolutely every College\nemployee approached by FELIX has declined to comment on the\ndetails of the investigation.\nAlthough it seems that the\nmatter is in hand, the question\nremains: If the money isn't regained how will the loss be dealt\nwith? Both Lucy Chothia (Union\nPresident) and Mike Hansen\n(Director of Finance) c once ede d that the Student Union will not be\naffected in any way by the in ci dent. Mr Fraser reiterated this\nreassurance. However, it is not\nclear whether the student body \u2014\nas a whole \u2014 will or will not be\naffected. The situation will be\nreassessed when the affair has\nbeen concluded.\nFELIX will be following the\ndevelopments in the case.\nBike Clampdown\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nCollege Security are initiating a new campaign to clamp down on\nthe wave of bicycle theft sweeping\nthe College.\nOn Monday, College Security\nbegan distributing \"Lock it or\nLose it\" leaflets to cyclists entering\nthe campus. Notices about the\nrecent spate of thefts have also\nbeen distributed.\nAt the end of last month,\nCollege Security reported at least,\ntwo groups of youths acting suspiciously around the bike racks.\nBicycle owners are being\nurged to to get their bicycles coded\nat a police station or the soon-to-be-announced Crime Prevention\nPresentation at. Imperial. All accessories should be removed before\nparking bikes, and 'D Lock's should be used to secure them.\nThese can be bought from room\n150 in the Sherfield Building.\nAs always, any suspicious\nactivity within College should be\nreported to Security on extension\n58900.\nContents pages one&two&three news page three editorial and credits page four yacht club page six\nthe new icu constitution page seven the docker's fist page nine the s files: flailing against the\nforces of darkness! page ten caving club page eleven the proms page thirteen pimlico connection\npage fifteen clued up pages sixteen&seventeen clubs+ societies+ union news pages\neighteen&nineteen standby: the reviewers return pages twenty two& twenty three the seven day guide\n\n"

Normal operations will begin\nnext friday when the fashion and clubbing columns will run\non alternate issues. You have been warned.\nS not in our backyard OK, let's be honest, of all the cool\nplaces that are ace for students in\nLondon, South Ken isn't one of\nthem. However, seeing as we're all\nstudying here for three years, we\nmight as well be positive and make\nthe most of it. Right. Um, it's clean\nand safe for a start and probably\nhas a lower dog-shit count than\nanywhere else in Britain. \"But what\nis there to do?\" I hear you cry!\nWell, the Natural History\nmuseum is ace, especially the\ncreepy crawl y and dinosaur bits.\nLaunch Pad at the Science\nmuseum is free and it's the nearest\nthing to a amusement park this side\nof where the nearest amusement\npark is.\nFor those 'all night se she s' you\nneed not worry about running out\nof food because Gloucester Road is\nthe 24-hour munch ie capital city of\nthe universe; Harts, for absolutely\nanything that's yummy, but\nespecially their chocolate\ndoughnuts, the 7-11 for their Ben &\nJerry's chocolate chip cookie dough\nice-cream and Burger King for the\nobvious. There's also a Texas Lone\nStar which makes absolutely\nenormous burgers that even Mr\nCreosote would think twice about.\nNot to mention a Haagen Ddzs, a24 hour pat is serie and the\nSandwich shop opposite the\nHuxley building or thereabouts.\nAlso deserving a mention is this\ndead good, dead cheap sandwich\nshop run by this little Italian blok e, FELIX mora\nbut my co-writer has just informed\nme that it burned down last term so\nwho knows if it's still there. It is\nworth bearing in mind that even\nHarrods' food hall is cheaper than\nSouthside Shop. There are also\nshed-loads of restaurants in the\nSouth Ken area but we can't mention them all, so won't mention\nany.\nHigh Street Kensington is on\nthe opposite side of college and is\nhome to many a shit shop. It's expensive, and you're better off\ngoing to Oxford Street, Soho,\nCamden or Portobello Road...The\none redeeming feature of this area\nis The Churchill, an Irish pub/Thai\nrestaurant (?!) on Kensington\nChurch Street; the beer is brilliant,\nthe food is fantastic and it's rather\ncheap. Speaking of pubs you will be\nglad to see that I'm not going to\nbore you shit less and give you yet\nanother guide to the pubs in South\nKen. Apart from - go to the\nEnnis more behind Linstead\nSouthside and take someone else's cheque book with you.\nFinally, some friendly advice to\nthe fresh faces at college: don't, under any circumstances, pull\nmoon ies in front of red police cars\nas they're loaded to the brim with\nanti-terrorist rocket launchers and\nyou're likely to get blown up. Oh,\nand cars with diplomatic plates\nhave positively no qualms about\nrunning you over. That's diplomatic\nimmunity for you.\n^ j) flying away from home Speed is a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish - beginning in an\nelevator, then speeding bus and finally to a runaway train. This film has\nalready been titled 'Die Hard on a bus', but Speed is better, loads better.\nThe excitement does not come from gun toting extras that die after one\nglance at the main character, but from the cliff hanging effects, the\nexternal environment that constantly works against you and over which\nyou have zero control. That excitement comes from the impossible\nposition Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is placed, trying to save the lives of\ninnocent victims from Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), who has a large\ninterest in money and blowing people up. When things seem doomed to\nfail they get worse: an elevator full of people that is prevented from\nfalling by a small winch and a bomb on a bus that must not drive below\n50mph in the middle of Los Angeles rush hour.\nThe main action takes place on the doomed bus where Annie,\n(Sandra Bullock) ends up driving when the original driver is shot by a crazed passenger. From then on the excitement escalates and a continual\ncascade of impossible problems face Keanu and the only question is; how\non earth is he going to save the bus and all its occupants this time?\nThis is Keanu's second action film, after Point Break, and he has\ncertainly taken on the role of being the nineties action man. Dennis\nHopper is, as usual, very good as the sociopath who uses novel plans to\nextort money. First of all he doesn't use a car full of people but a bus full\nof people, then the bus is not wired to go off when it starts but when it\nslows down.\nThis is definitely one film to go and see. The exhilaration is\nindescribable and the feeling of being pumped up with adrenaline leaves\nyou speechless afterwards.\n>5\nFrom runaway buses to bureaucracy out of control, Ladybird,\nLadybird (above) takes us down a completely different road. Starring\nCrissy Rock and Vladimir Vega and directed by Ken Loach, Ladybird,\nLadybird, is based on the true story of Maggie, a decent mother caught\nup in the red tape of the social services. Her four children are put into\ncare when a lover brutal is es her, and when she meets saintly South\nAmerican exile Jorge, the authorities can't believe she's finally settled into\na stable relationship. When Maggie and Jorge have two daughters, each\nof them are taken into care.\nCrissy Rock won an award at the Berlin Film Festival for her portrayal\nof Maggie, and at first she is disturbingly good. But the later parts of the\nfilm bring the suspicion that she may be a one-trick pony as in her despair\nshe rants, swears and generally conforms to a social workers' stereotype\nof dysfunctional maternity.\nWhere Loach and writer Rona Munro succeed best is in the wit and\npin-sharp accuracy of their portraits of ordinary life in the karaoke bar\nand on the council estate. Because the screenplay concentrates on\nMaggie and Jorge, reducing the social workers and Maggie's children to\nciphers, the film lacks moral complexity and pre-judges any questions it\nmight raise about the right of the state to interfere in this most\nfundamental aspect of our lives. At the end we are simply left with the\nfeeling that there has to be some sort of a system and it isn't going to\nwork for everyone.\n\n"

    "content": "Horse Prize\nNews Saved: the new projector is installed in the now flood-free Da Vinci's Flood Disaster Averted\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nImperial College's compulsive\nequestrian ites were jumping for\njoy last, month with the announcement of a new prize for a scholarship in horse racing. To \"encourage the growth of\nscholarly work on the racing\nindustry\", the British Horseracing\nBoard announced four prizes for\nundergraduates expected to\ngraduate in 1995.\nThe prizes include annual\nmembership (junior membership\nif applicable) at the racecourse of\nyour choice (but not, Wolverhampton or Southwell and only\njunior membership at York), and\nsome books.\nTo qualify, simply send a typewritten copy of your long\nessay or dissert a ion on the subject\nof the horse racing industry,\ntogether with a letter from your\ntutor or Departmental Head\ncertifying that the paper's topic\nhas been accepted by the College,\nbefore 30th April 1995 (unless you\nmake a special case for extending\nthe deadline).\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nIn what has been described as a tremendous feat of organisation,\nthe damage caused by last\nThursday's flooding of Da Vinci's Snack Bar was completely\nrepaired within 24 hours.\nScaffolding with s podi gh ts was set\nup while all of the ceiling tiles\nwere being replaced in time for the\nbeginning of Freshers' Week.\nThe damage was extensive \u2014\ncarpets may have to be replaced\ndue to shrinkage. Further disaster\nwas, however, averted. If the\nflooding had happened a day\nlater, the newly installed big\nprojection television would have\nbeen caught, in the mess.\nMore worrying is the lack of\nany explanation as to why the new\npipes, installed in the past few\nweeks during renovation of the\nheating system, should show holes\nafter extensive high-pressure\ntesting. The faults were\nsuccessfully capped, and the\nsystem now appears to be working\nwell. Dan Look (Dep. Pres. F&S), described himself as being devoid\nof any sparkling comments, and\nsaid \"the, heating engineers were\njust, wandering around saying they\ndidn't know why it had\nhappened.\"\nTHE BRITISH HORSE RACING BOARD ESSAY PRIZE\nHorseplay: write an equestrian essay and win top prizes.\nThe closing date for entries is only six months away.\neditor i aL Fantastical Party Time\nFirstly a plug. Next Monday, at.\n6pm, there will be a 'media\nparty'. This will be a gathering of\nthose people, interested in the\nvarious forms of magnetic media\navailable for today's computer\nequipment: eg. disk drives and\nmagnetic tapes. There will be\ndisplays by companies at the\nleading edge of media supply plus\na 'hands-on' section for adults\nonly in the senior common room...\nThe Real Party\nLies, lies - it's thursday afternoon\nand I'm desperate for a joke. The\nreal 'media party' will be a gathering of Imperial College's three student media. It will be on\nMonday, in the Union Building\naround 6pm. STOIC, IC Radio\nand FELIX will be pushing\ntheir wares in an atmosphere\nsweetened with cheese, and wine.\nAnyone interested in writing,\nfilming or spinning disks should\nattend, sign up and drink up too...\nMaking Science Sexy\nWhilst I don't, entirely agree with\nthe message promoted in the 'S FILES' I certainly agree with\nmaking students think about\nscience. So many drift through\ncollege seeing their time here as an\naggregation of exams, course\ncredits and, possibly, knowledge. I certainly did. This approach is like\na computer game in its amorality:\nEnter through the main gates,\nfind food and drink and attempt\nto get to the next, level by\ncollecting keys (exams) until the,\nend-of-game sequence at. the\nRoyal Albert Hall. Except it isn'ta game: your science will be used to\ncreate poisonous chemicals and\ntools of thought-control as well as\nhigher crop yields and non-stick\nfrying pans. A friend argues that,\nsaying that, a product of science\nhas no intrinsic moral content, (eg.\na gun is neutral until used for\ngood or evil) is rubbish: what,\nabout a flamethrower, with its\nindiscriminate range of fire? Is\nthat 'more' evil? Accepting that\nscience is not grey and unrelated\nto day-to-day life must: also carry\na need to believe that it can no\nlonger claim 'academic immunity'\nfrom what we term morality.\nBelated Thanks\nMarcus Alexander and I sent\nvarious felines between London\nand Cambridge over the summer,\ntrying to secure the true likeness of\n' FELIX'. The final version is\nsitting on the cover and I'd like to\nthank Marcus for the time and\ncat food he spent producing it.\nCredits\nEditor\nPrinter\nBusiness Manager\nAdvertising Manager\nEditorial Team\nOwain Bennallack\nAndy Thompson\nTim Bavister\nHelen Randall\nArt and Literature\nCinema\nLayout and Design\nMusic\nNews\nJon Jordan\nWei Lee\nPaul Dias\nVik Bansal\nMike Ingram\nPhotography Ivan Chan and Diana Harrison\nS Flles Tim Parsons\nStandby Jon Jordan\nSeven Day Guide Ivan Chan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week\nSteven Newhouse, Marcus Alexander, Bryan and\nChenda and Russ from STOIC, Wei Lee, Jon Jordan,\nPaul Dias, Juliette Decock, Mike Ingram.ls abel Castro, Zena Perriera, David Cohen, Dan Look\nHelpfulness Andrew Tseng & Steven Newhouse\nFreshers' Fair Knights\nRichard EyresTim St Clair, Paul Dias\nMike Ingram and Wei Lee\n010CT94 FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nTHE DOCKER FIST lie rumour is that at\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ university all students\npartake of a for mid a i; ble three year period\n'-:\n\":'':\n5-:\n; of sex and drugs, do\nlittle or nothing at all and then\nwalk into a top job after their\ngraduation ceremony. To a certain\nextent, this may still be the case at\nsome establishments, and may\nhave once been the case at certain\nothers, but this rumour has never\nand will never be true of imperial\ncollege. \"Why?\" you all clam our. Why? Well, essentially, it is\nbecause imperial is a science col-leg e, this means that most of the\nstudents are male and really quite\ndull. Nothing really happens here,\nthe anorak brigade\n- or the Kens - care\nfor nothing but the\nsound of a ball point on clipboard\nand of course Star\nTrek (the new one\nwithout Captain Kirk). There is a very large group of\noverseas students\nwho, in their wis-dom, tend to be\nfairly insular and stay more or less\nwithin their own groups. There is the\nsporty crowd - not\nto be mistaken with people that\nplay sport, by the way which tends to occupy the union bar on\nFridays and consists mostly of fat\nbearded men or potentially fat\nbearded men from the school of\nmines, the various drinking clubs\nand the ' hard' sports clubs like\nRugby. Here there may also be\nfound some of the college's female\nmembers, but like the male members of this drunken bigoted carbuncle on society they are pre-dominantly fat and bearded. Worse still than the violent and\nabusive imperial yo b bos seen here\nare those of the anorak brigade\nwho have girded up their loins and\ndecided to become more than just\nmycologist s of plasma physicists,\nthis breed of Super Kens have\nthrown off their chains and in an\neffort to win friends and influence\npeople (which they see as being\nachieved by becoming a fat bearded violent abusive yo b bo) they sign\nup for rag. Collecting money for\ncharity is a reasonable past time, I will not scoff at that, but I for one\nwas fairly concerned after my one\nrag outing the Tid d ly winking thing - when the then rag chair\ninsisted that everyone start chanting their union song, or whatever it\nis. I don't particularly mind chanting unintelligible crap in public, I have been known to do just that at\nStanford Bridge of a Saturday afternoon. But to do so holding\nhands around Eros in some sort of\nby\ncoo ol. That's coo ol by imperial\nstandards at least. This summer I came into one of the student halls\nto collect a friend to go out, and\nlow and behold I passed through\nthe threshold of a party where two\nex-union presidents were sitting\naround a table smoking. \"Do you\ncane it man?\" was the question,\nand it was one that left me cold\nbecause I had no idea what they\nwere talking about. I realised then\nthat it had been about five years\nsince I had any contact with real\ndrugs pricks, who knew all the\ncoo ol things to say, and more importantly what they meant i.e. Dabs and Doves, which to me\nremains totally meaningless. It was\nMost people are caught in the imperial sex\ntrap, which is so weird it is almost\nimpossible to document\nsemi-religious solemnity was to me\nquite sinister, and I was certain\nthat fat ted cows were about to\nmeet their bloody end for the benefit of some startled American tourists, who at the time were to\nastounded to even say \"neat\" at\nanything. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by the fact\nthat the last two rag chairs have\nbeen lesbians either, there is nothing remotely fab or trendy to be\nhad from rag what so ever.\nNow, I have perhaps led you\nslightly astray on the sex and drugs\ntheme by intimating that neither\nsex nor drugs are to be found at\nimperial. Both are present, but\nboth in a bizarre warped nature\npeculiar to this place. Drugs can be\nfound here, but only if you are\na good summary that these blok es were probably a little older than\nme, yet I had n't said anything remotely as sad as that since the\neighties. The dope kiddies along\nwith the plastic hippies are the\nsaddest out of all the imperial sad-does, because they see themselves\nas some sort of subversive underground movement. \"Lock the door\nman\". It is a ridiculous rebellion\nagainst some sort of middle class\nsense of propriety. You will find\nthat most of these people are from\nquite well-off backgrounds, and\nwere at home in Surrey reading\nEnid Blighton books during the '88\nacid revival. Whereas I being the\nmacho and heroic type (I mean\nwistful and enigmatic of course)\netc...\nGlyph\nSexual desperation among undergraduates leads to a very\nstrange form of positive assort-ment. This is to be observed mostly\nin public places like the j cr, where\nthe world's ugliest couples can be\nseen s noggin g each other, and firing those \"I am in an exclusive sexual relationship and you aren't\" glances around the room at people\nwithout some fifteen stone bearded heifer draped all over them.\nMost people are involved else-where, or are caught in the imperial sex trap, which is so weird it is\nalmost impossible to document.\nThe rules are, you cannot go out\nwith anyone as your mates will\ntake the piss out of you so much as\nto be not worth the pros of the\nwhole thing. This\nis of course applicable to both sexes.\nThose people that\nfear embarrassment i.e. every one, cannot break\ntheir cool under any circumstances\nand get involved\nwith someone on\ntheir course, or in\ntheir hall, or in the\nsame group of\nfriends, as to do\nso would be\nunbearably embarrassing in front\nof your friends. Prospective girl/boyfriends are either or both\nof two things, rough and/or sad.\nOf course if your fear of falling into\nthe piss take zone is greater than\nyour sex drive, you can survive.\nAlthough after a while people start\nasking you if you are gay, which\nalways presents a great opportunity to play with people's minds, an\noften under-appreciated art form.\nIt seems that there is only one way\nto beat the system, and that is to\ngo out with someone from... the\noutside world. If you try this\nmethod, remember not to tell the\nowner of the required complementary organ that you are from impe-rial, as it is famous for its sad\nbastards.\n01CT91 FELIX HQ\n\n"
