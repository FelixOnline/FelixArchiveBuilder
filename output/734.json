    "content": "HON. SECRETARY\nCandidates\nfor the post of\nDave Colley\nproposed by Jackie Peine\nDave is a3rd year\nundergraduate studying in\nRSM and has been Hon Sec\nand Publicity Officer there. I am proposing him for ICU\nHon Sec as I believe he has\nthe ability and commitment to\ndo the job well.\nJackie\nI feel totally that the main\nreason for a students' union,\nsuch as ours, is' to improve\nconditions and life for its\nstudent members, not to assist\npeople on an ego-trip or to\nadopt ineffectual external\npolicies. But having said that\nthere is room for union\ncampaigns on students affairs.\nI believe from experience\nthat the CC U's have closer\ncontact with students and\ntheir individual demands. So\nICU must continue to have the\nthree CC U's to listen and act\nin their own capacity and\nreport to ICU the general\nfeelings of the students. One\nthing I shall push for is greater\ninvolvement from Postgraduates in student life and\nthe CCU's. The fact that PG's generally don't take part in\nstudent life, for whatever\nreason, means that the union\nis wasting half its available\nsocial and academic talents.\nThe responsibilities affecting\nthe post I am running for\nrange from the organising of\ntransport to the organising of\nmeetings. The latter of which I have had experience at and\ncan handle quite\ncom pen tent ly. The transport\nsubject is one that has\naroused controversy, however\nI feel a certain amount of\ncommon sense and prior\nplanning on both sides could\nsort this out.\nThese are my views on the\nUnion and how it could be\nimproved and are my platform\non which I wish to be elected.\nThank you for taking time to\nread it, and I hope you find it\nagreeable enough to vote for\nme.\nYours\nDi Colley\nDave Colley did not\nsubmit a photograph.\nMichael Newman\nproposed by Lance Holland\nEvery year students complain\nabout the lack of choice in the\nsabbatical elections,\nresign ising themselves to\nanother year in which their\nUnion is thrown away. Every\nyear our Union has become a joke to college, outside bodies\nand its own members. Every\nyear the Union fails to get the\nsupport of its members. Every\nyear the students blame the\nsabbaticals and the\nsabbaticals blame the\nstudents.\nI am standing because after\n3 years of contributing to\nUnion clubs and of\ncontinuously criticizing the\nsabbaticals, students and the\nUnion structure I believe I have gained the knowledge,\nexperience, and above all the\nWILL to bring about change.\nI believe sabbatical posts\nhave far too long been treated\nas Youth Opportunity Training\nSchemes for administrators\nand media. It is about time we\nhad a Union that represented\nits members, that informed its\nstudents, that encouraged\nthem to contribute, that had\ntheir respect, that was willing\nto change.\nDo not throw your Union\naway. Next year can be\ndifferent, it is your choice. The\nUnion mascot is the Phoenix,\nit is surely time for it to fly\nagain.\nCandidates\nfor the post of FELIX EDITOR and Print Unit\nManager\nDave Jones, who has been returned unopposed has written a statement of intent\nDave Jones\nSince the beginning of term I had been expecting to have to\nfight a hard election campaign\nto win the FELIX editorship.\nNigel's surprise decision to\nwithdraw left me unopposed\nwhen papers came down last\nFriday. This is not the way I would have wished to get the\njob; editor of FELIX is too\nimportant a post to be won\nwithout a struggle.\nNevertheless I am confident\nthat I have the commitment\nand enthusiasm to produce\nan exciting newspaper and\nto encourage students to\ncontribute.\nIn two and a half years at\nCollege I have come to regard\nFELIX as one of the most\nworthwhile aspects of life at\nIC. Though it is published on\nbehalf of IC Union, the paper\nis widely read by staff and\nstudents alike, and is the only\nmedium which reaches\neveryone in College. Because\nof this, FELIX provides\nstudents with a platform for\ndiscussion that is sadly\nlacking elsewhere in the Union\nstructure. ICU is described as\n'apolitical' and whilst this\nstance is laudable, it too\nfrequently manifests itself as\nanarchy at UGM's. The FELIX\nletters and opinion pages are\nthere for anyone in College to\nuse to discuss issues of\nimportance.\nThis year's FELIX has been\ngenerally very popular, but\nsome parts of the paper have\ntended to look dull and fc tale because of unimaginative\nlayout and a lack of\nillustrations. Next year I aim to\nexpand the range of articles,\nand adopt a more exciting\npresentation of the sections\nwhich have been allowed to\ngo to waste. In addition I hope\nto be able to brighten up the\npaper with more comic-strip\ncartoons, puzzles and\ncom petit on s. As this year's news editor I have been happy with the\nstandard of news coverage in\nmost issues, but FELIX still\nhas room for many more\nreports and news features.\nImperial College is a rather\ninsular place and its\nnewspaper sometimes reflects\nthis. Next year's FELIX will\nreport on more stories of\nstudent interest outside IC,\nboth in London and on a national level.\nStudent involvement is the\ndriving force behind any\nuniversity newspaper. I hope\nthat you will wish to take a part in the production of your\nnewspaper, and that you enjoy\nreading FELIX next year.\nDave Jones\nSabbatical Elections: Voting 10th and 11th March.

So Tony\nagreed with the Chaplaincy\nto print Chi-Rho on\nSaturday. All evening I was\nin hall, near my phone,\nfeeling ill and unaware\nthere was any problem.\nHad Chi Rho been\ndi satisfied they should have\nphoned me.\nThe Print Unit has only\none litho and one printer.\nThis means that if one job\ncauses problems, the\nfollowing jobs are held up.\nWe attempt to give\ncustomers accurate\nestimates of when we will\nfinish work. We can not,\nthough, guarantee when we\nwill complete a job. There\nis no need for me to keep\ncustomers informed of our\nprogress on their job if\nTony is working because\nhe is perfectly able to tell\npeople how much longer\nwe will be.\nOn at least two occasions\nthis term I have paid\npersonally for the printing\nof Chi-Rho. Perhaps the\nChaplaincy would like to\noffer to pay the bank\ncharges that I in cured through doing that.\nChristians, I thought, are\nmean't to be understanding\nand tolerant. We have had\nenormous problems this\nyear printing anything. I would have hoped that\nWest London Chaplaincy\nwould have shown some\nunderstanding and\ntolerance. I would have\nhoped, they could have\nforgiven us. Instead the\nw*!?* kers wrote a letter\n(they didn't have the guts\nto complain to me\npersonally) that irritated me\nand, far more importantly, a very loyal and dedicated\ncross,; this makes you vote\ninvalid. To indicate a second ch ioc e place a'2' against your co and i date of\nnext preference to show a third choice write a'3', and\nso on You need not put a number against every\nname. Do not mark the\nsame number against two\ncandidates.\nChi-Rho\nIf you look at page 4, you\nwill see a letter from the\neditors of Chi-Rho, the\nnewsletter of West London\nChaplaincy. They complain\nabout the way I have\nlooked after the printing of\ntheir newsletter. Last Friday\nI went home at 6pm because I was ill, Tony\nwarned the Chaplaincy that\nChi-Rho was late and said\nthat he would tell them how\nthings were going.\nUnfortunately election\npublicity held up the\nmember of permanent\nstaff\u2014Tony. I doubt that\nTony will work for them on\na Saturday in future.\nMost of the student\nmembers of FELIX staff,\nwho give their valuable\ntime to help the Print Unit,\nhave also been irritated by\nthis letter. I think Chi-Rho\nmight have problems\ngetting them to help in\nfuture.\nThe Editors of Chi-Rho\nhave shown themselves to\nbe thoughtless, gutless and\nselfish. They are about as\nbad an advert for their\nreligion as could imagine. I am sorry if I have offended\nother members of West\nLondon Chaplaincy. Its just\nthat letters offending the\npermanent staff are not on.\nPermanent Staff\nThe Union staff in the\nUnion Office, the FELIX\nOffice, the Snack Bar and\nthe Union Bar are some of\nthe most loyal and\ndedicated people I 've ever\nhad the pleasure of\nmeeting. Certain clubs,\nsocieties and individuals\ntreat them like morons. The\nChi-Rho letter to FELIX is\nonly of one numerous\nexamples of\nthoughtlessness I could\ngive you.

    "content": "Princess Ida By Gilbert and\nSullivan\nOpsoc's last few February\nshows have been\nremarkably consistent, both\nin the good points and the\nbad, and die-hard Gilbert\nand Sullivan fans like me\nhave come to regard as\ntraditional such features as\nclear, confident singing\nfrom the principal soloists,\nan extravagantly lavish set,\nand a strong performance\nfrom the main comic, as\nwell as less clear, confident\nsinging from minor soloists,\na chorus with no room to\nmove on the concert Hall\nstage, and very bad vocal\nbalance.\nPartly because of\nGilbert's treatment of the\nso lists and partly because\nof the skill of the producer,\nthis production was notably\ndifferent.\nBut it was Barbara\nO 'Neill as Lady Blanche\nwho stole the show utterly.\nFrom her first appearance\nas the austere blue-stocking, through her\ntemptation and seduction\nby Melissa to her eventual\nconnivance with the plans\nof the trans vest i ties, she\nwas totally captivating.\nParticularly impressive was\nthe delivery of her 'abstract\nphilosophy' speeches.\nGilbert's words need\nexcellent diction; Miss\nO 'Neill didn't miss a syllable, and her timing was\nfirst rate.\nDo the Snack Bar Bop\nNot Princess Ida\nOver the last few years IC\nDramsoc have developed a reputation for high\nstandard prod uci tons. Kennedey's Children\n(March 12th15 th, Union\nConcert Hall) will enhance\nthis reputation. The play is\nset in an American bar on\n14th February, 1974.\nWanda is a middle aged,\nmiddle class prude.\nSparger is a drag queen.\nJust when you thought it\nwas safe to go back into\nthe Union Building\u2014they're\nback! Yes, the unthinkable\nhas happened Norman and\nNot a Leather Nun\nthe Nutburgers have\nreformed. This\nunprecedented step has\nbeen taken in the public\ninterest just for you. You\nlucky, lucky people.\nTheir reunion gig (surely\none of the major milestones\nin rock 'n' roll history) will\ntake place tomorrow,\nSaturday the 8th March.\nThe venue? Back where it\nall started\u2014the Union\nSnack Bar.\nThe momentous event,\napart from being an\nunmissable opportunity to\nsee in action one of the\nmost talked-about garage\n(well, kitchen actually)\nbands on the music scene\ntoday, may well provide the\nanswers to some burning\nquestions. Has Charlie\nlearnt to sing? Will Norman\nwear those shades? Will\nDuncan be sober enough\nto find the stage, let alone\nsee his drum-kit? What new\nchoreographic\nmasterpieces have Karin\nand Roo dream up? Will\nAndy achieve his lifetime\nambition to play a three-note guitar break? Will the\nband be able to transcend\nthe ultimate\naccolade\u2014enshrine ment in\nlegend on the walls of the\nMech Eng Toilets?\nRona is a hippy. Mark is a Vietnam Gl. Carlo is a third\nrate actress. The five of\nthem explain how the\nAmerican dream hasn't happened for them. The\ntheme is a little clich ed. Most of the cha rct ers have\nbeen written about before\nand examined in more\ndetail. The Gl who has\nflipped is portrayed far\nmore graphically in the\nDeerhunter.\nHaving criticised the\nplay, I'd better praise the\nacting. Amateur actors\noften have problems when\nthey try to play Americans.\nThe accents are either mid-Atlantic or thick deep south\naccents. All the actors\navoided making these\nmistakes. Sam Duerden as\nRona, the hippy, was\nparticularly convincing. She\nmanaged to convey a feeling of wasted\nenthusiasm. It is, though,\nunfair to pick out one\nmember of the cast as they\nwere all good.\nUnfortunately the\ndirection was not always up\nto the standard of the\nacting. At times it\ndistracted one from the\nacting.\nI recommend you go and\nsee Kennedy's Children as\nit is student acting at it\nbest. It is well worth the\nprice of the ticket.\nLast Friday I spent the\nnight in St Stephens\nHospital with severe\nconcussion. However I can\nassure you that this had\nnothing to do with going to\nsee The Leather Nun and\nZodiac Mindwarp and the\nLove Reaction at the\nGreyhound, Fulham, apart\nfrom a certain\nchronological relationship.\nThe Greyhound is not\nexactly the easiest pub to\nfind if you think it is in\nFulham. It is actually\nclosest to Hammersmith\ntube and lies in Fulham\nPalace Road. Having\nsus sed this little red herring\nmy tubby denim clad\ncohort and I arrived to find\nan audience of distinctly\nwie rd and varied types\nrolling in from the pub next\ndoor. At the same time the\npiped music suggested an\nattempt to appeal to both\naging ex-punks and aging\nex-hippies, while the drinks\nprices were a half hearted\neffort somewhere between\npubs and d reg holes like\nDingwalls.\nFirst on were one Mr.\nMindwarp and his band.\nOne can best describe this\nhigh energy assault as a cross between Dr. & The\nMedics and Motorhead.\nRespledent in german\nhelmets and comic book\nbiker gear the foursome\npresented a well drilled if\nrather, short show of heavy\npsych a delia. One gets the\nimpression that Mr.\nMindwarp does not intend\npeople to take things too\nseriously and this fitted\nrather well with his 'Medics\nstyle' stage banter, not to\nmention doing Thin Lizziy's 'Rocker' as an encore. What\nI read in the press says this\nbunch of gonzo id nut cases will be big, big, big (as\npeople in the business are\nprone to saying). If they\ncan only get a more\nsubstantial set together\n/vith out blowing the whole\no lace to pieces I would\nagree.\nMeanwhile on to The\n.eat her Nun. who last\n\u2022>u red this country as a Ljpport for a group cal ted Throbbing Gristle which\n;<d to a series of riots. Well\n\u2022 \u2022 i ere was still a lot of\n.h robbing around but the\n>\nid Not an un warped mind\nrioting appears to have\nbeen replaced by a distinctly good natured\naudience. I quickly gained\nthe distinct impression that\nthe white haired lead singer\nwas attempting to become\nSweden's answer to Iggy\nPop with his stage\nposturing. He also seemed\nto have some ambitions in\nthe Lou Reed direction as\nwell, adopting a style so\nlaid back that it verged\ntoward going to sleep on\nstage. However I fear that\ndespite The Leather Nun\nplaying some reasonable\nthrash along stuff, both\nmess rs. Pop and Reed had\ntons more originality.\nAnd so to hospitals\nwhich personally give me\nthe creeps. The junior\nnurses were very nice to\nme but frankly the senior\nstaff seemed to have a very\noffhand attitude.

    "content": "I sat in a puddle last week. I remember distinctly the\nmind blowing sensation of cold\nfilthy water seeping into my\nunderwear. It was not a pleasant experience. Yet before\nI had time to gro k the situation\nfully my mind was jolted into\nawareness by a passing football\nhooligan who spat on me\nwithout warning. I became\nsuddenly conscious of the\namazing oneness of the\nuniverse. I knew instinctively\nthe is ness of existance. I found\nmyself able to harmon is e with\nthe mind-waves of beings from\ndifferent worlds, and I could\nfeel for myself their hopes and\nfears, their sadness and their\njoys. And all of these feelings\ncombined to form the vibrant\nforce of love which\nencompasses all things.\nThe tranquility descending\ninto my mind was disturbed by\nthe inexplicable appearance of\na Ten Headed Telephone\nBeast. I knew that would mean\ncertain death if I allowed its\nright to exist. 'Be gone', I screamed 'for you are a mere\nfigment of my imagination'. It\nbelched as it was consumed in\nflames, but in it's place a thought-voice resonated.\n'Soup', it growled, 'thick\nbubbling soup...'\nUnfortunately the\nmanagement have confirmed\nthat there will be no soup\navailable at the Albert Hall on\nTuesday. Instead, however,\nthey promise a chunky\nsteaming session from\nEsposito, Curiosity Killed The\nCat, and The Patatoe Five. If\nyou are into jazz funk dance\nmusic, with the odd lentil here\nand there, this little do is highly\nre com ended; if you can find a ticket. Personally I can not\nstand this sort of drivel which is\nhighly reminiscent of an onion\nconsomm e. For something with\na little more meat, it should be\nnoted that beefy Maximum\nEffect will be playing the Kings\nHead Fulham on the 23rd of\nMarch. The band is composed\nof the remnants of Nick\nTurner's Inner City Unit, but\nwithout the man himself. A reliable source tells me that\nthey can be best be described\nas a science fiction orientated\n\u2022Capital\nIDEAS..++.+ version of the Cramps. Well\nboogie down there for some\nreal out of mind experiences.\nI was mildly surprised the\nother day to discover a tribe of\neskimos living in my fridge.\nWhat shook me though was the\nfact that one of them was\nlanguages. These they v v',11 drop\nover the unsuspecting populace\nwill be lured into investing in\nthe Stock Market, thus crea tine global financial havoc. It is the\nthat the second wave of ballon;\nwill attack, dropping signed\ncopies of the outer London\ntelephone book. The extra\nstrain placed on British\nTelecom by civilians wishing to\ncalled George Burns. I find it\nincredible that western\ncivilisation has penetrated into\nall aspects of every single\nculture on Earth. Why should\nan Eskimo be named after a dead Scottish poet? It is\nobvious that Scottish nationalist\ninfiltration is at work. My fears\ncall relatives in London will\ncreate explosions throughout\nexchanges world wide. The\ncombined effect of ten\nthousand exploding telephone\nexchanges will, it is believed,\nthrust the planet into the\ndepths of a Nuclear Winter. It is\nwere further justified when I discovered that a fore met i one d Eskimos had constructed an\nigloo out of a hag g is I had\nhidden in the freezer\ncompartment. Having said this\nthe ski lift which they had built\nfrom fish-fingers and frozen\nbeans was a work of\nengineering brilliance. I have\ninformed college security of the\neskimo's existence, so there is\nno longer any need to worry\nthen that the nationalists\ncooperation with eskimos will\npay off. Without the low\ntemperature training which the\nScots have purchased it is\ninevitable that Scotland will\nbecome the centre of the new\nworld republic. Watch out boys,\nit could happen any time...\nI sometimes wonder why I about food diss a pea ring from\nSouthside fridges.\nA mysterious letter came into\nmy posse sion over the\nweekend. It gave details of a new campaign by the Scottis1\nNationalists to take over the\nworld. Their plan is both\nmasterly and infallible. Afloat ill a of thirty thousand hot\nair ballon s will set sail against\nthe armies of the world, armed\nwith copies of the financial\ntimes printed in thirty\nbother to stay sober. In fact\nmost of the time I wonder if I am sober. Life, I think is just\none wacky game of rugby; just\nwhen you are about to score a try, only yards away from the\nline, some heavyweight gonzo\nkicks you where it hurts before\nrunning off with the ball in the\nopposite direction. Certainly,\nthough, a game of good old\nrug ga does leave you with quite\na mammoth appetite . At this\npoint I am forced to c once ed that even the thickest of thick\nfarmhouse soup is insufficient\nfor a rugby player (boy o). With\nthis in mind, however, might I suggest a visit to the Texas\nLone Star in Gloucester Road\nsurrounded by posters of Wild\nBill Hiccup, one could do little\nbut have a really transcendental\ngut filling time. The Star\ncharges about eight quid for a half pound chilli burger with\nchips, jacket potato, sour creme\nand salad, followed by a wacky\nice cream.\nOccasionally I become very\nbored with playing pinball and\ndrinking coffee and sometimes\nI feel the need for something\nmore cultural. With this in mind\nI trundled of to the\nCommonwealth Institute at yon\nend of Kensington High Street\n*o peruse a substantial\nexhibition on the arts, science,\ncrafts and technologies of\nassorted Commonwealth\ncountries. I noted with approval\nthe lifesize model of a stilt\ndancer, and a bronze budd ah, during my quick tour.\n(Incidently there's a stunning\ngold Buddha in Battersea Park,\nwhich is worth the odd snap\nand for those who are\ninterested the Victoria and\nAlbert has quite a large stone\nBuddha on display.) The\nInstitute will be staging an\nexhibition on the 'struggle and\nsurvival' of the Carribean from\nthe 6th of March. Gloria\nHuniford freaks can catch her\nthere on the 26th. The whims and fantasies of\ntrendies never cease to amaze\nme. I am somewhat doubtful\nthat the recent yuppie craze of\nduck feeding will ever catch on.\nFor those who wish to increase\ntheir street credibility getting up\non Sunday morning armed with\na loaf of bread seems to be the\nin thing to do. The nearest, and\nas far as I am concerned the\nbest, duck feeding ground is\nthe Serpentine in Hyde Park.\nThere one can attract, amongst\nothers Canada Geese and\nCoots. Whilst the Geese are\nexcellent with roast potatoes\nand carrots, I find that coots\nare much easier to smuggle out\nunder a coat. So there you\nhave it. As Turgid Appfeldrink,\nIberian Mouse Hunter once\nsaid, 'show me a mouse\ndropping and I 'll show you an\ninteresting vegetarian recipe'.\n\n"

She is familiar with\nC CU workings and is under\nno illusions as to the workload\nthat being DP would bring.\nThe Union needs a DP who\ncan tackle the job without first\nhaving to learn about the\nUnion structure. Experience\ncounts\u2014vote for Jackie.\nHugh Stiles\nJackie Peirce Candidate for\nDeputy Pres Proposed by\nHugh Stiles\nDuring my three years at\nImperial College I have\nmaintained an involvement\nwith the students' Union at\nevery level, from being an\nordinary member of its clubs\nto being Vice President of one\nof its Constituent College\nUnions. Through that\ninvolvement I feel that I have\nreached a position where my\nfamiliarity with, and\nexperience of, the Union in\ngeneral, how it works and the\nproblems it faces, will allow\nme to make a real and\neffective contribution to its\nrunning in the coming year.\nThe Deputy President is\nresponsible for the Union's finances, so it is vitally\nimportant that he/she be able\nto gain the confidence and\nsupport of the Union Finance\nCommittee, so that it will\nalways be working towards\nmaxim ising the benefit, for all\nIC students, that we can gain\nfrom our limited resources.\nThe coming year will be a highly challenging one for the\nDP in particular, especially\nwith the changes taking place\naround the Union Building,\nbesides which it is always\nessential that the DP, as a member of the executive,\nmake whatever contribution\nthey can in every area of the\nUnion. This all requires a great deal of commit t ment and\nenergy, both of which I hope\nyou will give me the\nopportunity to provide.\nPaul Shanley\nproposed by Steve Blake\nShan is the sort of blok e whose mother denies all\nknowledge of knowing him. If\nhe was a horse, he would have\nbeen put down by now. He\nwas born in Hammersmith and\nbrought up (v omitted) in\nWimbledon, which accounts\nfor his lovable cockney\ncharacter and charm.\nShan's been known in the\npast to indulge in a pint or ten\nof Red Stripe although he very\nrarely drinks and stands up at\nthe same time.\nHis enthusiasm for the\ncollege is quite simple\u2014he\nhasn't got any. If elected to\nthe post of deputy union\n'president his first task will be\nto demand a recount ow in p io\nthe fact that he realises he's got about as much chance of\ngetting in as Carl Burges has\nof learning what a lavatory is\nused for.\nIf Shan does get elected,\nhe'll take all his friends out for\na drink. Then the three of\nthem will probably go on\nsomewhere else afterwards.\nHe comes from a strong\nIrish background (who\n\u2022doesn't?) which accounts for\nhis sick sense of humour and\ngood looks.\nShan lives (occasionally) in\nthat well known home of good\ntaste, Holbein House. The\nplace has really welcomed\nShan with open arms in much\nthe same way as a goldfish\ndoes when it sees its first\nbicycle pump.\nThe reason for electing him\nis clear\u2014He's the best man for\nthe job. (At the time of writing,\nhe's the only man for the job.)\nHis hobbies include\ndrinking, driving half an Austin\nPrincess, donating money to\nsuch charities as Watneys,\nCharringtons, Charles Welles\nand Whitbreads, and upsetting\npeople.\nShans main election pledge\nis to turn the Rectors house\ninto a new hall of residence-Ash hall.\nA Vote for Shan is a vote for\nfreedom\nSHAN'S YOUR MAN\n\n"

In a year as\neditors of the Chaplaincys\n\u2022\n\u2022 weekly magazine 'Chi-Rho'\n\u2022 we have tried to make use\n' of the service and are very\n! impressed with the high\n;\nstandard of workmanship\n1\nand dedication provided by\nTony the printer.\nHowever over the past\ntwo terms since Hugh\nSouthey succeeded Dave\nRowe we have been\ndissatisfied with the service\nprovided and have found\nHugh to be unreliable and\ntotally lacking in his regard\nfor his customers. We have\nrepeatedly been promised a deadline for production of\nChi-Rho by Hugh which is\nthen not met. As the\nmagazine is weekly this\nmeans that the material we\nhave spent many hours\nassembling would be out of\ndate by the time it is\nprinted.\nWe realise that for\nseveral weeks FELIX have\nhad an en our mou s amount\nof trouble both with the\nprinting equipment and\nwith Tony being ill,.\nbecause of this we have not\nbeen surprised in the past\nthat Chi-Rho could not be\nprinted in FELIX and have\ntried to make alternative\narran gm ents which on two\noccasions involved\n\u2022 spending more then 20\nman hours photocopying it.\nWhat we do object most\nstrongly to is promises of a deadline not being met\nwhen the Print Unit is\nrunning smoothly. On\nWednesday 26 at 1.00pm we discussed the state of\nthe printer with Hugh and\nhe agreed to print the\nmagazine for 6.00pm Friday. This deadline and\ntwo later ones passed\nbefore the magazine was\neventually printed at\n8.00pm Saturday. One a cl occasion we brought along\nseveral people to help fold\nand collate. At no time\nduring Friday or Saturday\nold Hugh contact us or\neven leave a message in\nthe office explaining the\ndelay and all\ncommunication was, as\nusual, coming out thro ug.a third party.\nLast week's FELIX\ncontained a letter\ncomplaining about the\napathetic students of IC.

When\napproached by our\npresident and asked to\nexplain his action he\nretorted 'It is my privilege\nto remove these posters'.\nThis student has since\nbeen identified and a complaint against him was\nlodged with the security\nofficer Mr Reeves' as well\nas the union.\nWe as a society believe it\ndisgraceful for a mature\nstudent of Imperial College\nto behave in this juvenile\nmanner. Our policy has\nalways been to encourage\nanyone who is in\ndisagreement with us,\nrather than rest ort to\nactions that can only be\ndescribed as deliberate\nhooliganism, we hope that\nthis incident will never be\nrepeated.\nYours etc...\nThe Committee of the\nFriends of Palestine\nHooliganism\nMoans\nDear Sir,\nI would like to draw your\nattention to an incident\nwhich took place on\nTuesday the 18th of\nFebruary.\nMembers of the Friends\nof Palestine Society were\nputting up some posters\nEngineering\nMoans\nDear Sir,\n\u00a3 o, yet again we see\nrepeated the old clich es about science and\nengineering being able to\nsolve all the world's problems: 'If you are a thoroughbred Engineer,\nyou are destined to make\nthe world a better place'.\n(Mark Field, last week's FELIX). Why then, with our\nunprecedented levels of\ntechnical achievement, are\nthere so many people still\nstarving? And if, or perhaps\nmore to the point when, the\nnuclear hol c aust occurs\nthen it will prove beyond\ndoubt that technology is a bad thing.\nOn a more everyday\nlevel, our engineering\nknowledge has made\npossible the construction of\nnew machines which\nde pr j ye millions of their\njobs and make their lives\npurposeless. Those still in\nwork are alienated by the\nvast systems and power\nstructures that it has been\npossible to create, it is no\ncoincidence that the horror\nand violence of modern art\nand philosophies like\nExistentialism have only\nemerged in a technically\nadvanced culture. Medical\nprogress may give us\nlonger lives, but our old\npeople frequently become\nsenile or are unable to take\npart in society in any\nmean ful way. Chemicals\ninvented to make food last\nlonger or more attractive\nhave been discovered to\ncause cancer or other\nproblems. Elsewhere,\nscience and technology\npollutes and destroys the\nenvironment, kills people\nand causes other nefarious\neffects.\nIt is certainly not science\nand engineering which will\ncreate a better society, as\nour civilisation's abysmal\nrecord shows, though\nperhaps they may make\ninteresting careers.\nPeter Heap\nElec Eng 4\nUndergraduate Research Opportunities Programme\nThe Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme\nexists to enable undergraduate\nstudents to participate in\nresearch either in or outside\ntheir own departments. It is\nentirely voluntary and is open\nto all undergraduate students\nThe scheme has been go in r since 1980 and over 200\nundergraduates have spent\ntime in research laboratories\nthroughout the College as\nUROP students. Typical\ncomments have been '...a really interesting experience'\n'...gave me a chance really to\nget to know my supervisor\npersonally', '...gave me a flying\nstart with my third year\nproject', '...made me realise\nwhat research is all about'.\nThe staff members involved\nhave been equally enthusiastic\nand the J f current Directory\ncontains offers from 120 staff\nspread over all departments.\nSince the major URO P activity has turned out to be\npaid work during the summer,\nwe have adopted a new\norganisation this year. The\nmember of staff responsible\nfor vacation training in each\ndepartment is acting as the\nURO P agent. He holds copies\nof the URO P Directory and is\navailable to advise on the\nscheme.

If you sign up, you\nshould let either the Vacation\nTraining Rep. or Prof\nAnderson know. If the\nresearch involves a summer\njob, the member of staff\nconcerned is responsible for\nfinding the funds. Usually, 10\nweeks' work would be\nexpected and the salary is a matter of negotiation between\nyou and your supervisor. The\nonly rule we lay down is that it\nshould not exceed \u00a370 per\nweek.

    "content": "Unpopular Press\nAn alternative Guildsheet appeared in the departments of City and Guilds College on\nMonday. The magazine was produced in the old format of stapled, duplicated sheets,\nrather than the new lithographed version. It featured articles s at i rising the Guilds Exec\nas well as Motor Club and the Mascotry Team.\nProduction involved the removal of .the Union Office Gestetner, which was followed by\na retaliatory action of taking the STOIC Video-recorder.\nAfter the theft of the Gestetner. A note was left saying the machine would be returned before it would next be needed, signed by the\n'Fluffy Rabbit Mascot ry Team'. When IC Union Honorary Secretary Quentin Fontana was\ntaking Sabbatical election\npapers at 5:30pm, he noticed a member of STOIC leaving the\nUnion Building lift at the\nground floor, at a time which caused Mr Fontana to become suspicious. He went up to the\nSTOIC room on the top floor,\nand found the missing\nGestetner there. However,\nunable to repossessing the\nmachine alone, he took the\nSTOIC video-recorder as a means of retaliation.\nOn Monday, the Gestetner\nwas returned wrapped in\nChristmas paper, however it\nwas found later that the paper\ntray no longer worked properly.\nIn Mr Fontana's absence on\nMonday, Dave Kingston returned the video-recorder to\nSTOIC intact.\nThe Guildsheets produced were distributed at the\nentrances to departments\nAfter the initial storm over the\npaper, FELIX received a letter\nfrom the editors a polo gi sing for\nany offence caused by the\npublication. They added that\nthe pseudo Guild sheet was never meant to be attributed to\nGuilds Union or to dissuade\npeople from getting involved in\nthe Union. Death In Chemistry\nA man was killed while using\nthe 'pater-noster' lift system in\nthe Chemistry Biochemistry link\nat 9:00am on Tuesday. The accident happened between\nLevels 5 and 6 of the building\nwhile the man was trying to\ntake a plank of wood down one\nfloor in the lift. The wood, measuring approximately 6' by\n3', became jammed between his\ncompartment and the platform.\nIt is thought that the wood bent\nand snapped, causing serious\nwounds to the man's neck and\nhead.\nShelly Fuller, a member of\nBiochemistry staff, heard the\nnoise on the 6th floor and\nrushed to the scene of the\naccident. She found the man\nbleeding profusely from the\nhead, on level 5, having\nmanaged to get out of the lift.\nShe rushed down to level 4 to\nget help, and found that the lift\nhad finally stopped.\nBiochemistry Departmental\nSafety Officer Eric Matthews\nand Kevin Cope arrived\npromptly, to administer first aid\nto the man, and an ambulance was called. The ambulance arrived after 20 minutes, and he\nwas rushed to hospital. He died\nfrom his wounds later.\nThe man was a member of a firm of subcontractors carrying\nout maintenance work for the\nBiochemistry department. It is\nnot clear as to why he used the\npater-noster to carry such a large piece of wood down one\nfloor, as there are notices\nwarning against transporting\nlarge objects by it.\nMiss Fuller, Mr Matthews and\nMr Cope were commended by\nCollege Safety Officer Dr\nGordon Hargreaves and\nSecurity Officer Geoffrey\nReeves for their extremely\nprompt action. The ambulance men were also\ncommended for arriving rapidly\nin heavy rush hour traffic.\nThe pater-noster is thought to\nhave stopped automatically,\nalthough Mr Reeves is\nappealing for witnesses to come forward, and to ascertain\nwhether someone did push the\nemergency stop button.\nFree Friday 7 March NO 734\n\n"

If\nyou haven't yet regained\nyour senses after the\nstunning performance of\nMahler's2 nd Symphony,\nthen be warned! There's only a week to go before IC\nChoir un leach a night of\npassion on the\nunsuspecting masses! But\nmore of this later...\nBefore getting on to the\ninteresting bits of this\narticle, here are some\nboring facts. The Choir's history began in 1949,\nwhen an senior lecturer in\nElectrical Engineering,\nnamed David Tombs,\ncollected together and\ntrained a small male voice\nchoir to sing at that year's commemoration day\nceremony. In January of\nthe following year, Imperial\nCollege Choir was founded\nand has since gone from\nstrength to strength,\nbuilding up an enviable\nreputation for high musical\nstandards. Over the years\nwe, have performed such\ndiverse works as\nMonteverd's Vespers,\nStravinsky's Symphony of\nPsalms' and Beethoven's Mass in C to name but\nthree.\nThe Choir currently\nconsists of about 150\nmembers who usually meet\nevery Thursday evening in\nMech Eng 342 to rehearse\nmaterial for forthcoming\nconcerts. Since 1953, the\nChoir has been conducted\nby Prof Eric Brown of the\nCivil Engineering\ndepartment, whose\nenthusiasm has contributed\ngreatly to the development\nof the Choir.\nAs well as holding weekly\nrehearsals, the Choir has\ntwo weekends away during\nthe year. These weekends\noffer valuable rehearsal\ntime in beautiful\nsurroundings and enable\nthe choir members to get to\nknow each other better.\nThe first of these was at the\nbeginning of this term,\nwhen we spent a weekend\nrehearsing and relaxing in\nthe Tudor splendour of\nCobham Hall, in the Kent\ncountryside. At the end of\nthe Easte, vacation, we\nshall be visiting 'Pigotts' in\nBuckinghamshire\u2014a converted farm which is\nnow more accustomed to\nCw la.m0 \u2022 tJ^m: \u00a3im. \u2022\nthe sound of piccolos and\ntenors than pigs and\ntractors.\nHowever, the highlight of\nthe year, is certain to be\nour forthcoming concert\nnext Friday. For just \u00a3 2 . r( students) you will be able\nto hear a memorable\nperformance of JS Bach's St Matthew Passion. This is\nperhaps one of, if not the\nmost famous of Bach's choral work's. It was first\nperformed in 1729 in\nLeipzig: unfortunately, the\nfirst performance of this\nand other major works by\nBach were, in the words of\none modern scholar of\nmusic, presented in student\nperformances of mediocre\nquality. IC Choir, however,\ncan promise a dramatic and\nmoving performance of\nexcellent quality, which is\ncertainly not to be missed.\nThe concert will take place\nin the Great Hall at 8.00pm on Friday 14th Of March.\nTickets are bound to be in\nshort supply, so hurry to\nbuy yours now from Choir\nmembers or from the\nHaldane Library.\nIf you're interested in\nsinging with us next term,\nthen come along to the first\nsummer concert rehearsal\non Thursday 20th March at\n5.45pm in Mech ENg 342.\nAlternatively, you could get\nin touch with Jose Molina,\nthe choir chairman (Room\n626 Huxley, tel Internal\n5779).\nDelft\nBrasserie\n\u2014the restaurant with a difference\n\u2022Superb Indian cuisine\n\u2022Friendly attentive service in an atmosphere of\nstyle and comfort\n\u2022Fully licensed\n\u2022Air Conditioned\n\u2022Seating for 110\n\u2022Private parties for up to 40 catered for\n\u2022 10% discount for students and staff from IC\nOpen 7 days a week\n12noon2.30 pm6 pm11.30 pm134 Cromwell Road (near to Sainsburys)\nKensington\nLondon SW7 4HA013707617 FELIX Friday 7 March 13\n\n"

He claimed\nthat he had said that he\ndidn't care what students\nthought of him. London Student reporter\nSaira Shah who wrote the\nstory, told FELIX that she had interviewed Mr Burgess1 over the phone. She had admitted that she had made\nno accurate notes of the\ninterview. She had only\ntried to get the gist of what\nMr Burgess had said.\nBrian Pulls\nIt Off\nBrian Hartley of Physics3 was fined \u00a325 for streaking\nat the England vs Ireland\nRugby International last\nSaturday. Mr Hartley was pelted by snowballs from\nthe crowd as he made his\nepic run. The sprint was ended by four policemen\nwho escorted him away.\nComputing\nSuccess\nThe College chapter of the\nAssociation for Computing\nMachinery ( ACM) recently\nheld a programming\ncompetition, with eight\nteams of four students\ntaking part. They were set a series of problems to be\nsolved in four hours, and the\nwinning team managed to\nsubmit three correct\nsolutions. The winning team\nare pictured with Prof BMc A Sayers, Head of the\nDepartment of Computing,\nwho awarded the prizes. The A CM's next event is a lecture on 'The Seeing\nComputer' to be given by\nProf Igor Aleksander on\nTuesday March 4 at 1pm in\nHuxley 145.

A meeting of College\nSecretaries from London,\nincluding John Smith from\nImperial, felt that given the\nstudent orientation of the\nservice, student unions\nshould support it from their\nfunds. They mentioned the\nexample of the QM C organisation, which is itself\nfunded by the student union\nthere. They proposed that a fund be set up to which\neach college union involved\nwould contribute whatever\nmoney it has available.\nIC Union Welfare Officer,\nPete Wilson said that the\nSecretaries had made a mistake, since without\nfunding Nightline will lose\nits sole sabbatical, and\nwithout one the entire\nservice will fold. He added\nthat Nightline are looking\ninto alternative funding in\norder to provide a breathing\nspace for the organisation\nwhile its eventual fate can\nbe decided.\nIC Union Hustings\nThe IC Union Hustings\nU GM took place on Thursday in the Great Hall.\nThe candidates for\nPresident, Vice-President,\nHonorary Secretary, and FELIX editor each made a speech. As the post of\nFELIX editor is\nuncontested, David Jones made a statement of intent.\nThe candidates for\nPresident are Do bb in, the\nPantomime Horse's Head\n(alias Paul Mercx), James O' She a, Chris Stapleton,\nChristine Taig, and J Martin Taylor.\nStanding for Vice President are Jackie Pierce\nand Paul Shanley, while the\ncandidates for Honorary\nSecretary is contested by\nDave Colley and Michael\nNewman. Changes to Union Bye Laws were also voted on at\nthe U GM. The Women's Officer was formally made\na member of Council, however a motion to make\nthe electorate female-only\nwas defeated. Bar Commit ee was also made a sub commit ee of ICU, owing to the Union Bar now coming under control\nof the Union. The last\nchange was to the number of second ers needed for\nDep Rep elections in the\nDepartment of Management Science, reducing the\nnumber required from ten.\nNew Editor\nDavid Jones has been\nreturned unopposed as next\nyear's FELIX editor. Mr\nJones was the only\ncandidate for the post when\npapers came down last\nFriday, following the\nwithdrawals of Nigel\nAtkinson and Grenville\nManuel.\nMr Jones made a speech\nof acceptance at the IC\nHustings UG Mon Thursday.\nHe said that he would like to\nsee more students working\nI on FELIX and contributing\nto the letters and opinion\npages. Next year's FELIX, he\nadded, would cover a wider\nrange of news stories,\nincluding reports from other\nLondon Colleges and\nnational news of student\ninterest.\nBar Closed\nThe Union Bar was closed early on Friday night. The Bar had been granted an\nextension until 2 am but\nUnion Bar Manager Moore Lyttle closed the bar at\n12:30am when people\nstarted standing on the\ntables, contravening one of\nthe new rules in the bar.

    "content": "A Figment Of\nRCS's Imagination\nDear Ed,\nI read with interest your\nreport of Tom Mel liar-Smith's resignation,\nespecially the discovery\nthat he is not registered at\nIC. This certainly leads\ncredence to my theory that\nTom Melliar-Smith does not\nexist.\nConsider the evidence:-in any picture of\nhypothetical RCS hack, you\nwill notice that he has two\narms, each with a forearm,\nmaking a total of ten. Ten\narms is an odd number for\nany human being. Ten is\nan even number. The only\nTom Melliar-Smith or Sean\nDavis\nnumber which is both odd\nand even is infinity.\nTherefore if Tom MelliarSmith exists, he has an\ninfinite number of arms. As\nthis is plainly impossible\nwe have proved that Tom\nMelliar-Smith does not\nexist, and so it is not\nsurprising that registry has\nno record of him.\nWe now come to the\nworrying question: why\nhave the pages of FELIX\nand Broadsheet been\npeppered with references\nto the activities of this\nmythical character for over\na year? The answer is\nsimple. RCS, that haven of\nageing, wrinkled, and\ndegenerate hacks, faced\nwith increasing\nunpopularity and budgets\nplummeting every year,\nmade a last desperate\nattempt to gain some\ncredibility. Their idea was\nsimple, yet elegant. They\nneeded a short-haired\nfresh-faced youngster,\npreferably with a double-barrelled name, to stand for\nHon Sec. With modern\ndisguise techniques being\ndeveloped at IC for M15, it\nwas quite easy for even the\nmoth-eaten Tony Spencer\nto take his turn at being\nTom Melliar-Smith for the\nday, never mind a selection\nof other hacks like Sean\nDavis, Sarah Kirk and Hairy\nBob.\nNow that the RCS elections have come\naround again, there is no\nlonger any need to keep up\nthe pretence.\nOnly one question\nremains. What do they have\nin store for us next year?\nVours concerned ly Diane Love\nEx Physics PG\nPenny Ottway\nIs Wrong\nDear Sir,\nHow easy it is for Penny\nOttway (FELIX 733) to\ndismiss talk of the\nratio\u2014and how selfish.\nAs an academic rep I have been at many\ncommittee meetings where\nmales present have\nsuggested the ratio is\nequally unsatisfactory for\ntheir female counterparts,\nonly to be answered by a shaking of heads and\ngrinning from\napproximately 1 in 6 of\nthose present.\nThere is little doubt that\nalthough the ratio has\nsome disadvantages for\nwomen, the vast majority\nfind they have a very active\nsocial life in spite of, or\nperhaps because of, the\nratio. So it is just too easy\nfor Miss Ottway to dismiss\ntalk of ratio on the grounds\nthat she does 'not notice\nthe lack of women' in her\nyear. She may not, but\nwhat of the majority? The\nmales.\nThank you Miss Ottway\nfor rising once again the\nquestion of the ratio in the\npages of FELIX\u2014it has\nprovoked more discussion\nwhich may eventually lead\nto changes for the better.\nAnd for most of the people\nat IC that means a more\nequal ratio.\nYours sincerely,\nDan Salmons,\nPhysics 1\nPenny Ottway\nIs Right\nDear Hugh,\nI could not agree more with\nthe views expressed in\nPenny's letter in last week's issue of FELIX.\nI can understand that the\nmen at IC are worried by\nthe lack of females. In fact I can appreciate that some of\nthem are downright\ndesperate, but why is the\nonly argument ever raised\nwhen diss cussing 'The\nRatio' is that it is 'Bad for\nthe women'. We don't mind!! A few women exploit\nthe situation, a few, I suppose, must dislike it,\nbut for the most part we\nsimply do not notice. Or at\nleast we would not notice if\nMen at IC: downright\ndesperate.\nwe did not get\nquestionnaires and\ndiscussions thrown at us\nfrom the minute we walk\nthrough the door.\nWhen discussing\nadmissions it seems that it\nis always 'The Ratio' that is\ncited as putting women off.\nThTs is not so. IC has a slightly higher ratio of\nfemales to males than the\nScience departments of\nother Universities. I can\nonly assume from this that\n'The Ratio' puts off more\nmen than women, which\ndoesn'ts up rise me!\nOn positive\ndiscrimination, I think it\nshould be stressed that noone has suggested this\nshould be used as a means\nof getting more women into\nIC. What the College is set\non doing is attracting more\nthan its fair share of the\nintelligent women already\ngoing into science. It is\nalso considering plans of\naction to encourage more\nfemales to consider science\nat a school level.\nYours sincerely\nAlice Williams\nAc Rep Physics 2\nCorrection\nDear Hugh,\nYour report on the plan to\nre house the Holland Club\nis accurate in all respects\nexcept one. There is no\nplan to incorporate the\nspace presently used as the\npost room, where mail is\ndelivered and sorted, into\nthe new Holland Club.

    "content": "Candidates\nfor the post of PRESIDENT of IC\nUnion\nJames O 'Shea\nproposed by Douglas Earl\nIn campaigns of this kind, it is\nusual for a candidate to\npresent a long list of beliefs\nand promises in his or her\nmanifesto. These are, usually\nlargely similar, which is not\ns uprising as everybody\nstanding*seriously for\npresident has the students\nbest interests at heart. With\nsuch similarity of opinion, the\nvoter has to decide on a candidate to support not on\nissues but on style and\npersonality. All presidential\ncan didi at es show evidence of\nbeing egotistical (by standing\nfor the post in the first place),\nwhich discourages many\npeople from voting. Do not be\ndiscouraged by the ego mania, which goes with the job, listen\nto the various style of the\ncandidates, and then go out\nand vote (for me).\nIn what way, then, is my\nstyle different? Well, first of\nall, I have never been one of\nthe select group which\ndominates ICU council\ndecisions affecting their lives\nbeing taken, seemingly by\nmagic, and only revealed\nwhen reported by FELIX. The\nunion has a structure for\ngetting information to, and\nreceiving information from ,\nthe student body in the form\nof the Dep Reps. If properly\nused this system has\ntremendous potential for\ninvolving more students in the\ndecision-making processes of\nthe union, but too many Dep\nReps are lax in their\nattendance of meetings and\nwho can blame them when the\nmeetings are the trial they are\nnow. The president should be\nkept in closer touch with the\nstudent body, to whom he is\nresponsible but must make the\neffort to contact those Dep\nReps who do not always\ncontact him. As President, my\nmain priority would be to\nmaintain this contact.\nSpace prevents a more full\nexposition of the style of\npresidency I would try to\npursue. If you have any\nquestions please, ask them\nany time you see me. Now get\nout there and vote.\nJ MO 'Shea\nChris Stapleton\nproposed by Sarab Threadgold\nFight Against Silly Cuts in\nScience and Technology\nChris 'Papa Doc' Stapleton\nstands for truth, justice, the\nNational Anthem and little old\nladies on the tube. He pledges\na range of policies designed to\nmake IC great again, stop us\nbeing pestered by NUS, and\nhave us totally disowned by\nULU.\nChris, known as 'El\nPresidente' to both his friends,\nhas planned austerity\nmeasures to make student\ngrants obsolete and rep la cable with Government bonds. He\nwill press for a reduction in\nHall bills for payment in\nKrugerands, or by Barclays\ncheque. He will reward this\nyears President, Carl Burgess\nwith a free repatriation and\np 'ans to make the Union Bar\nprofitable by selling it to\nBudweiser.\nHe plans to 'get tough' with\ntypical student be ha v our by\narming IC Security men and\npromoting Geoff Reeves to\nGruppenfuhrer.\nRemember those who have\nhad a profound effect on his\nlife, Chris will award\nhonour ary degrees to\npresidents Reagan, Marcos\nand Leon Britton.\nStudents failing their degree\nor simply not attending a lecture will, in future, be\ncharged with 'wasting\nLecturers time', be found\nguilty and promptly shot.\nSimilar law and order\nmeasures will be applied to\nUnion Bar staff, feminists and\npeople who throw up in\nSouthside.\nRemember vote Chris\nStapleton\u2014F.A. S.C.I. ST. We\nthink it makes sense.\nChris Stapleton\nChristine Taig\nproposed by Charles Troup\nIn my time at college I have\ncome to respect Christine's enthusiasm and commitment\nin her extensive areas of\ninvolvement. As secretary of\nIC Ents during its most\nsuccessful year and as\nWomen's Officer (not to\nmention posts held in the\nOrchestra, Third World First,\nand Appropriate Technology),\nshe has demonstrated\npersonality and\napproach ability as well as a high level of competence.\nHowever, it must be stressed\nthat she is not a hack in the\nsherry-drinking, elitist\nsense\u2014she will not shut\nrer self away from the views of\nit u dents, and she does\nrecognise that a world exists\noutside Imperial College and\nthat the image we present to\nthat world is vitally;\nimportant.\nIn short, I firmly believe that\nChristine is the right person to\nbe your president.\nCharlie Troup\nA manifesto is usually a list of\npromises never carried out\nMY only promise is to try to\nrepresent all students, not just\nunion office residents. Specific\nassurances are all very well,\nbut the important thing when\nvoting for president is the\ncandidate's attitude.\nAccommodation and\nwelfare, academic affairs and\nstudent's social life are all\nserious issues and should be\ntreated as such by your\nrepresentative.

Imperial.\nCollege MUST aim to provide\nmore cheap student\naccommodation to counteract\nthe problem-and the president\nmust take a firm stand on this\nissue.\nRepresenting all students\nwill include public ising my\naci'ons and intentions\nrec i uK rly in Felix and\nWLL OMING feedback; and\ncon r.

    "content": "Academic Affairs\nIn FELIX last week, RCS AAO Pete Klemperer\nattacked the recent survey organised by ICU\nPresident Carl Burgess and Guilds AAO Luke\nWalker. This week Luke replies\nI am sure many readers of\nFELIX will have read with\nsome surprise and disbelief\nthe comments Peter\nKlemperer made about the\nactivities of Carl Burgess\nand myself in his opinion\narticle last Friday. I hope,\nby writing this opinion, to\nreassure those students\nwho I have the privilege\nand resp on sib lit y to\nrepresent, that what Peter\nindicated is a gross\nmis re preset ation, and to try\nto persuade the student\nbody in general that their\ninterests are best served by\ncompetent representatives\nwho work hard to present\nan accurate and coordinated view to the\ncollege. I feel that Pete has,\nperhaps unwittingly, called\ninto question the credibility\nof student representation in\nthis college in a manner\nwhich can only be to the\ndetriment of himself and\nthe students he tries to\nappear to be representing.\nHe claims that he is\nsupposed to ensure that\nRCS students get fairly\nrepresented, and yet, by his\nown admission, fails (very\nfrequently, I might add) to\nattend important meetings.\nHe was absent from the\nmeeting of Undergraduate\nStudies Committee at\nwhich the membership of\nthe working groups was\ndecided, and would not\nhave been aware of the\nmost recent meetings of\nthe group concentrating on\nstudent needs (the group\nhe is a member of) if I had\nnot advised him when I( in\nthe course of doing my job\nwell) saw him that morning.\nI attended the meetings of\nthis group in addition to my\nnormal duties, and several\nmembers of the committee\nhave indicated their respect\nfor the time and effort I have put in.\nIt is because of his\nabsence at meetings that\nhe was not aware of what\nwas going on. The survey\nof all academic\nrepresentatives was\nprepared by Carl and\nmyself, if he had been\npresent at the meeting he\nwould have been able to\nmake useful comments on\nthe question on it. He\nwasn't, and now is trying to\nsave face by claiming that\nhis suggestions were not\nconsidered. If they were\nir rel event to what was\nrequired, is it surprising\nthat Carl ignored them?\nThe working group were\ngrateful to Carl and myself\nfor circulating the\nquestionnaire, and it was\nMartin Taylor and myself\nwho spent many hours\nprocessing the replies. I spent about fourteen hours\none weekend preparing a report on the questionnaire\nreplies, because Pete was\nbasically too idle to show\nany interest. The\nquestionnaire confirmed\ncertain suspicions of\nmembers of the group, who\nthen requested us to\nrelease a questionnaire to a small number of average\nsized year groups, to find\nout how representative the\nac reps' replies were. Any\nyear groups would have\ndone, but we were asked\nnot to survey more than\nabout three year groups,\nand not to select very large\nones because of the time\nfactor and the amount of\ntime it would take. A questionnaire was divi sed,a draft circulated to most of\nthe members of the group\nat the Board of Studies\nmeeting last Wednesday\n(which, you've guessed it,\nPeter was absent from) and\na final version of the\nquestionnaire was then\nproduced and PETER DID\nRECEIVE A COPY SO THAT HE COULD GIVE\nME HIS COMMENTS BEFORE I PRINTED IT\nAND CIRCULATED IT. His\nstatement that he was not\nconsulted is untrue, he\nwalked into the C&G office\non Thursday\nlunchtime\u2014plenty of\npeople saw him\u2014to discuss\nthe questionnaire with me\nbefore I made the final\nmodifications to it on the\nword processor and printed\nthe copies. He goes on to\nsay that he is re know ed for\n'morality'\u2014blatant untruths\nin union publications are\nnot what I call moral!!\nThe questionnaire was\ndesigned to test a fairly\nsimple hypos thesis, the\nhypothesis is pretty clear\nfrom the questions put,\nbecause that was what was\nrequested by the working\ngroup. The group was\nprepared to rely on the\ndata as a basis for their\ndecisions, Pete is accusing\nthem of gross naivety if he\nthinks Carl and I could\nmislead them. In fact, it\nwas them, I stress not with\nme press u rising them, who\nput forward the hypothesis\nin the first place. I happen\nto agree with it, because\nmy experience as C& GAA O for a year and a half\nhas indicated this to me.\nPete should not be\nsurprised that my views\ntally with large sectors of\nthe student population in\nC&G, that's what any\nnormal person would\nexpect. Also, the idea that\nwhat the problems are is a set of details is obviously\nuntrue. That our courses at\nIC are theoretical is not a detail, it is an established\nand publicly-known fact of\npolicy\u2014it is an IC tradition,\nwe are noted for it.\nLectures being over-full of\nmaterial is also not a 'detail'\nit is an general problem in\nmy experience. I am\nprepared to accept that\nRCS students may feel\ndifferently, that is why we\nhave aCC U system. I don't claim to represent\nscientists in this college, I have already told him\nseveral times, as I am sure\nhas Jane Ryder (last year'sr csu AAO) that I am rather\nparochial in this respect. I only wish he'd do his job of\nrepresenting scientists as\nwell as I do mine.\nThe actual layout of the\nquestionnaire with plus 2s on the 'discontented' ends\nof the scales on the left\nhand side was for ease of\nprocessing the results, and\nthat layout was suggested\nto me by Dr Rogers,\nchairman of the working\ngroup, and Prof Blow,\nChairman of\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee. I am quite\ncertain that the students\nwho completed replies\ncould see how it was laid\nout, and were not\n'hoodwinked' by a 'contrived' questionnaire, as\nPete tries to argue. How\nsimple does he think\nstudents are?\nIt is not true that Chem\nEng 4, Civ Eng 2, and\nMaths 2 were used to\nrepresent the whole student\nbody, while we could have\nchosen other year groups, I selected the C&G ones\nta cause I felt they were\nfairly typical, I felt the\nChem Eng 4 would be a group of student who were\nnear the end of their\ncourse, and would be able\n*\"i make intelligent\nj m ment on the\n'inter grated ness' of their\ncourse. Both year groups\nwere of reasonable size,\nand, most importantly, I had confidence in the Dep\nReps concerned being able\nto circulate the\nquestionnaires in the very\ntight time-scale required.\nPeter comments about\nthe value of IC degrees in\nthe eyes of employers if\nour courses are radically\nchanged. The findings of\nour survey are not being\nused to justify a major redevelopment of all the\ncourses in College. He also\nmakes the obvious error of\nsaying that there will\nalways be year groups of\nstudents who make the\nparticularly comments we\nhave put forward, and then\nsays that the problems are\nlocalised and transient.\nThis college has had its\nreputation for many years,\nso the problems associated\nwith highly theoretical\ncourses are not transient,\nand besides we are not\narguing for a shift to highly\npractical courses, we are\npointing out some of the\nproblems which have no\ndoubt been with us for\nyears and which are now\nwhat things the USC is\ntrying to get sorted out\nproperly. The USC is a new\ncommittee, it is looking at\nissues which have been\naround for years, and this\nis the best chance\nundergrads have had in\nyears to ensure that these\nproblems are addressed\nproperly and useful action\nis taken. Pete tries in his\nfirst paragraph to claim that\nwe are not doing this, it is\nperfectly clear that we ARE. My position is that of a sponsored student, and I am prepared to admit that\nmy sponsoring company\nhas been in favour of my\nbeing A AO.I have the\nbenefit of regular and\nfrequent contact with\npeople in industry (a large\nnumber of companies are\nrepresented at one of the\nBoards I am on), and the\nfeeling I have about the\nway in which employers\nsee this college is not just\nhearsay, it is based on\npersonal knowledge of the\nsituation. If Pete thinks that\nit is the course here that\nemployers think are so\ngood, I would challenge\nthis, many emo lo yer s think,\nin my opinion, recognise\nthe importance of the\nabilities of the students\nwho are attracted here. It is\nthe people that are at least\nas important as what they\nknow. Readers may think\nthe distinction between our\nviews here is slight, but it is\nreal, and I feel that my view\nis rather more reliable and\ncomplete.\nFELIX Friday 7 March 7\n\n"
