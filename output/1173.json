    "content": "22 Games Felix > 2 May 2000\n\u00a9 games \u2022\u2022\u2014\u2014\u00bb\u00ab m^^m i mi m\\m \u2022 \\^^^^m^m.........1 iii mm n inn nr Hydro Thunder (DC)\nWell, it's called Hydro Thunder: guess what it's about. Yep, racing...on\nwater. A concept. But a good concept? For those of you who played and\nenjoyed the Wipeouf series, then this is not going to disappoint. Very similar in many ways (except with no weapons, although strangely you don't miss them).\nThe concept: You own a boat. You are good at racing your boat. You get\ninvited to a bunch of races organised by other people who like racing their\nboats (usually in illegal places) at very high speed. If you are good enough\nto finish the first (easiest) three courses, using the three beginner boats, then\nyou can do the medium ones, and then the hard ones, and then the bonus\nones (getting new boats at each level). So there's almost a plot. But no,\nnothing clever or new. On the other hand the boats do go very fast - so fast\nthat you can make them fly (which is quite surreal) for limited amounts of\ntime. You can also bash other boats out of the water when you have\nengaged your turbo (explained later), including police boats which are trying to stop you from having your fun, just because you pushed over a kayak er in an American lake. Which is nice.\nThe graphics are very nice indeed. A fast refresh rate and good sounds\nreally make you feel there. You remember the kayak ers? Well they squawk\nas you run them down. Very satisfactory. And when you engage your turbo\n(explained later), the engines transform. And what's better is that each boat\nhas a different transformation. Now, I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I do\nremember the first time I saw the credits for Voyager, and the engines did\nthat moving thing just before warping, I thought \"cool\". And this is much\nbetter. And there are thirteen boats. So at least thirteen times cooler.\nThe levels are fun too. Each one has different obstacles in the middle of the\nwater, depending on the setting: in the Arctic you have to avoid icebergs,\nand in the Far East you have to avoid big junks. Similarly you have different spectators - penguins and polar bears in one (oh dear, someone didn't do their homework), and paddy field workers in the other. And then there's the turbo... You go pretty fast anyway, but you can pick up these turbo\nthings which will increase your speed to about double, and will also make\nyou invincible to other boats. The only way to complete the levels is to know\nwhere these are, and to pick up at least all of them, and then use them all\nup in exactly the right places, so that you can beat the other boats by about\nhalf a second, if you're lucky. This game is quite tough. There are also\nsecret passages that can be found, and although they shorten the route,\nthere might not be as many boosts along the way. This is not good.\nSo play this game if you like burning water. The learning curve is challenging (but fair) and all in all this is good clean family fun.\nIn association with\ngames wire. com\nA WHOLE NEW WORLD\nTokyo Highway Challenge (DC)\nI know that you all lie in bed, dreaming of being subversive. You know\nwhat I mean. You want to get out of your bed, go outside, and steal a car. Then you want to joy ride it. Well now - if you want - you can.\nBrumm. This is fun.\nActually, to be honest, you don't really steal the cars - but you do drive\naround the Tokyo equivalent of the M25 abusing nice, normal, law-abid-ing citizens. And it's all at night, so I felt like I was joy riding. The concept\nof this game is unusual for the genre: you go round and round in circles,\nand if you see someone who is considered a rival (ie another racer as\nopposed to a normal commuter), you challenge them by flashing your\nheadlights at them. Then you race them while avoiding all the other pe o ple, in an attempt to win and get money. This game rapidly becomes\nquite difficult. Then, when you've got enough cash for your next upgrade,\nor you've beaten everyone on the road that night, you exit on a slip road.\nIt's a nicely satisfying way to end your day (although you can quit from a menu).\nThere are many different cars you can buy, but I really don't know how\nyou're meant to get enough cash to even buy one in addition to your\nstarting car. You receive money by beating other people in a race, and\nthe more difficult they are considered to be, the more money you get.\nHowever, you can also spend your cash on upgrading your vehicle, but\nthis can be more expensive than buying a new car, so it all seems to disappear if you want to have any chance of beating people.\nBut it's still good fun. The method of racing is more like a beat 'em up:\nthe further ahead of them you are, the faster they lose (for lack of a better description) 'energy', and when it gets to zero, they lose (and you\ncheer like crazy).\nThe control mechanism is easy to learn, but the idea is that you can modify your car to get more control over things like drift, suspension height,\ngear ratio, etc. So, if you upgrade your suspension, you are then given\nthe option to change how high you want it, whenever you want (except\nwhile driving), which definitely adds to the realism of the game. The\ngraphics are amazing as well (somewhat un surprisingly after all, surely\nthat's why you brought a Dreamcast), which is great when you're sitting\ninside the cockpit of the car, and there are several different soundtracks\nincluded on the disc, which seem to relate to the rival you're racing.\nAll in all a good game, and if you like the idea of being an urban war-ri or, fighting it out on the highways of Tokyo and generally causing widespread mayhem, then this is for you.\nWill Will\n\n"

When Ken Livingstone gets\nin, as he surely will, it is they who\nwill control his actions and keep\nhim in line. It is they who will sit on\nall of the new committees that will\ncontrol essential services and city-wide planning in the capital. And it\nis they who will ultimately be in\ncharge of the GLA's estimated\n\u00a33.3bn budget.\nAs you should all know - but\nquite possibly don't, as a result of\nthe government's incredibly low\nkey campaign to explain how the\nelection will be run - every registered Londoner (including all EU\nand Commonwealth citizens) will\nhave the chance to vote for both\nconstituency and party candidates.\nThe fourteen local Assembly Members will be elected on a first-past-the-post system, with votes cast in\nthe second ballot used to elect a further eleven representatives to\ncreate an overall position that\nroughly mirrors the proportion of\nvotes cast for each of the principal\nparties. The most important aspect\nof this is that any party that gets\nmore than 5% of the total vote will\nget a least one member into the\nGLA - so it's really important that\nyou chose carefully which party to\nvote for on each of the ballot\npapers.\nYou can find out lots more\n(including which electoral district\nyour home falls into and which\ncandidates are running in that con-st it u en cy) on the official GLA web-site, www.london.gov.uk.\nThanks for listening,\nTom Harris\nTESCO COMES OUT ON TOP\nDear Felix readers,\nI would like to thank everyone\nwho took part in the survey to help\nidentify the most popular shops that\ncould be assigned space on the\nwalkway when the SCR is redeveloped. We received a total of 33\nreplies with some excellent suggestions. The clear favourite was a supermarket type shop (Tesco was\nthe preferred supermarket) with\nnext favourite option being a Chemist/boot's type of store. The\nthird most popular option was a Computer store (this may just mean\nthat the CCS shop needs to do a big ad's campaign as most of these\nresponses didn't seem to know that\nit existed)! The fourth favourite\noption was a hairdressers and this\nwas followed in quick succession by\nan opticians.\nYou may also remember that\nfor every 25 people who participated one would get \u00a3101 The lucky\nperson who won the \u00a31 0 prize was\nMichelle Cope, the money will be\nwinging it's way to her very soon.\nThanks again to everyone who took\npart, your ideas have been\nimmensely useful and will be\npassed on to the estates division.\nYours truly,\nTim Trailor\nICU DP(C&S) WALL TO WALL\nMANAGEMENT? Dear Felix,\nHaving just seen the latest set\nof Times League Tables, I have to\nbegin to wonder about the way in\nwhich this College is run.\nIt is a credit to Imperial that we\nhave the best student-staff ratio in\nthe land (although as an undergraduate that statistic frequently\nseems somewhat questionable), but\none other figure which was quoted\nin the table severely worried me.\nFirstly, the percentage of staff\nwhose \"main function is teaching\nand research\" was a staggeringly\nlow 39.2% - it's frightening to think\nthat we have quite that many staff\ninvolved in non-teaching roles.\nOf course, many will be technical and ancillary support staff, but\nnonetheless that must still leave us\nwith a phenomenal number of\nadmin staff - particularly when\ncompared to other universities in\nthe country. For example, Durham\nmanages to achieve a63.2% score\nand even LSE is 1 0% better off than\nImperial, with 49.1 % of their staff in\nacademic roles - and although I'm sure that the College's shadowy\nsenior figures will rest happy in the\nknowledge that we still ranked\nhigher than both Oxford and Cambridge in this category, I'd hope\nthat the centuries old administrative\ntraditions of these frequently-incomprehensible institutions aren't being used as a model.\nThere's been a lot of talk of the\nappointment of the new Rector\nrecently, with many people suggesting that Imperial needs to be run by\na revered academic, not some\nhigh-flying CEO. However, in light\nof these numbers, let's hope that\nthe much-suggested leader of a certain pharmaceutical firm does\nindeed turn out to be Imperial's new head, because some modernisation and rational is ation of our\nstaffing and management structure\ndefinitely seems to be what this\nCollege needs if it is truly to compete in the twenty-first century.\nIn hope,\nJulie Potter\nAND FINALLY...\nDear Dave,\nWhat the hell was all that Goat\nPower stuff about last term? It made\nabsolutely no sense at all - surely\neveryone knows that the real future\nfor Britain's power needs is glow in\nthe dark sheep...\nMrs Trellis\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.\n\n"

A more detailed\nbreakdown, published in the Times\nHigher Education Supplement,\nshows that Imperial has the best\nstaff-student ratio in the country,\nas well as a good teaching assessment score and high spending per\nstudent. However, Imperial award\nrelatively few first and upper second class degrees compared to\nother leading institutions, and only\n40% of staff work in teaching or\nresearch.\nERASMUS IMBALANCE\nFewer UK students are taking up\nErasmus places to study in Europe,\nwhile more European students are\nchoosing to study here. Only\n9 9 9 4 British students took up\nplacements last year, compared to\n1 1 9 9 8 in 1994-95. Poor language skills and an insufficient\ngrant are blamed. In contrast, 2 0\n769 Erasmus students came to\nBritain in 1997-98, an increase of\naround 2500 since 1994-1995\nPRAYER ROOM PROBLEMS\nThe future of the Islamic Prayer\nRoom is uncertain after a meeting\nbetween ICU, the Islamic Society\nand College Administration. The\nplanned site, part of the Union's developments of the Beit base-ment s, was vetoed due to its proximity to the Union bars.

You won't find a better bargain in this part of London so\ngo on get out there and see some of the fantastic new films that are\nout. The Odeon Kensington is situated at the far end of Kensington\nHigh Street, and to get there all you need to do is get on number 9 or\n1 0 bus or take a twenty minute walk due west. Make sure you take student ID (Union, ULU or ISIC card) with you to take advantage of this\ngreat offer.\nAny Given Sunday\nSet in the world of American football, Any Given Sunday is the work of the\nmasterful Oliver Stone. He takes a look at the professional sports world from\na completely different perspective. It is the first time that Oliver Stone and Al\nPacino have actually worked together on the big screen.\nTony D 'Amato (Al Pacino) is the coach of Miami Sharks, a once glorious and\nmagnificent team. Now they are battling for survival after three consecutive\nlosses, sliding attendance and aging heroes. One such aging hero is the 39-year-old quarterback, Jack 'Cap' Rooney (Dennis Quaid) who clings to his\nteam as if he is trying to cling to his youth. He is replaced by the young, inventive quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) when Cap is benched due to\ninjury. From there on there is a wrangle between coach and the new young\nstar. The coach struggles to update his methods and the star refuses to con-form. Eventually, it all works out but there is much macho-ness first.\nStone is not one to be shy of tackling tricky subjects. He has produced masterpieces such as Platoon and JFK, both of which take a look at difficult subjects and then presents them in a thought provoking way. Any Given Sunday\ndoesn't do this. The story is predictable and is a tale about nothing less than\nwhat I would expect from a sport run by wealth. Admittedly, I don't know a lot\nabout American football, being more of a rugby fan myself, but this film did-n't shed any new or exciting light on a topic of which I am almost completely\nignorant. It does show how aging players cope with up and coming stars and\nhow sportsmen deal with finance over health.\nThere are some excellent performances from all the cast. The most notable is\nthe fine piece of acting delivered by Cameron Diaz. She plays Christina Pagniacci who has inherited the Miami Sharks organisation from her late father.\nThis character is a corporate bitch and a complete control freak. It is one role\nthat Diaz seems to fit very easily. After roles such as the pet-loving wife in Being\nJohn Malkovich or nice girl in Something About Mary, it's good to see she can\nstill carry this off. There isn'ta point in the film that she opens her mouth without shouting or being aggressive at some-one. There is also a cameo from\nCharlton Heston as the Commissioner of the Associated Football Franchises\nof America' whose job it is to look after the interests of all the owners of the\nfootball teams.\nFor those of you who are huge fans of American football and understand the\nrules, Any Given Sunday might be of some interest to you. It will give you an\ninsight to how the whole football industry is run as well as the emotions\ninvolved in being an excellent sportsman. If you are not a fan then this film is\nabout relationships on and off the sports field and how they are tackled. Just\none word of warning when you watch this film: don't leave until the credits are\nover as the best twist in the story-line comes at the end.\n\u2022 Helen\n\n"

After all,\nnone of this will effect the financial\nstatus of the world (the fact that\nthe FTSE and NYSE indexes didn't go into free fall admirably proved\nthat), but it has given the \" New Economy\" a much needed kick in\nthe backside that may finally persuade them to play by some normal financial rules (like profit abi li ty).

I suppose\nthat there's a few exams, but we can deal\nwith that. So we've a five week Easter holiday - time for some fun methinks. And, as\nif God has heard my calls, there are two\nBedrock nights at heaven over Easter.\nWicked and Wild!\nNight one is a birthday special, with\nDanny Tenaglia and Deep Dish joining the\nresidents to provide the kind of music\nclubs were built for. The night kicks off\nwell with the other rooms in the venue\nproviding a nice warm up to the wonder in\nthe main room. Then we move to the main\nroom to finish off with the above mentioned DJs. The night is good enough, but\nthe evening ends suddenly and we feel as\nif we've missed something.\nTwo weeks later and we're back again.\nOnly this time we know we're not going to\nleave disappointed. This time it's Maundy\nThursday, so the next day is a bank holiday and the crowd will be up for a big\none. What's more Sasha is appearing as\na guest (for the unit i a ted or those that\nignore the club scene, c lubbers feel the\nsame way about Sasha as fanatical football fans feel about their team). As a result, the queue is round the corner when\nwe arrive and it looks like it's going to\ntake well over an hour to negotiate it. So\nwe do what all. good student journalists\ndo: we b lag our way in at the front and\nare on the dancefloor in ten minutes flat.\nThe music was better than we could hope\nand the crowd moves like only a Heaven\ncrowd can. Three o 'clock comes and we\nswear we'll be back for the next one. See\nyou there?\nDan\nfrequency*/\\ Fridays\n@ Netting Hill Arts Club\nAs the house prices show, South Kensington is a highly\ndesirable place to live. However, although the architecture is nice enough, it's not really what I'd call the perfect\nplace for students to call home. From Prince's Gardens\nit's quite a long walk to the nearest twenty-four hour\nshop, and who knows how far to the nearest late night\ndrinking and dancing dens. It was for this reason that I couldn't wait to move away from the embassies and the\nmuseums and toward a place with a little more spice. My\nflat for the last three years now has been located in\namongst the kebab shops and tourist shops of\nQueensway, and although it's not exactly in club central\nFarringdon or the West-End, it is located within just a couple of minutes of quite a few funky night-spots. Perhaps the most notable of these is the Notting Hill Arts\nClub, and Felix managed to spend a few hours there\nduring the holidays to find out what's what.\nFirst things first, you don't get student discount on entry\non a Friday, so it's six of your finest pounds to gain\nadmission. The drinks inside aren't particularly cheap\n(three pounds a bottle), but there is quite a good selection if your wallet's up for a pounding. There's even\nAbsinthe on the menu for those who are tempted by\nthese things, and this can seem like an excellent idea\nafter a few beers. For those of drug orientated nature,\nnote that this is probably not the place for madness,\nrather one for those looking for a quieter night out or trying to be a bit too cool. Which brings me to my main\ngripe about this place. A lot of the people at the venue\ndon't seem to be having a good time and are just at this\nvenue trying to be out with the in crowd. However, all this\ncan be happily ignored as the music gets you going. Furthermore, you can also have a great time observing\nthose trying to be cool and seeing the fashion victims\nboogie on the dance floor.\nSo I suppose what I'm saying is that this is not your average dance club. It is, however, an excellent place to hear\nsome brilliant music and, although there is probably\nmore than your average sprinkling of weir does inside,\nthis should definitely not put you off.\nJohn\nRecommended\nClubbing\nThis clubbing column has been missing\nfor too long. Now it's back, I suggest\nyou take your pick and a break from\nrevision. After all, dancing is an excellent remedy to many problems.\nTuesday 2rd May\nStoned Asia @ Dogstar; FREE!\nThe Dogstar is an excellent venue for\nsome midweek boogie-ing and as this\nnight is free, you could a lot worse\nthan this if you have a night off.\nThursday 4th May\nBedrock @ Heaven; \u00a3 8\nPete Tong joins Mr Digweed and Mr Howells for Felix's favourite club night this month. Bedrock comes with the\nhighest recommendation possible and\nI don't think that there's a better club\nnight in the country. It's just a shame\nSasha can't play every week.\nFriday 5th May\nGallery @ Turnmills; \u00a3 8\nLast week was the fifth birthday party of\nthis excellent club night. I can imagine\nthis still going strong after another five.\nMove @ Ministry; \u00a3 8\nThe Ministry has had a lot to put up\nwith this year with the emergence of\nclubs such as home and Fabric. However, it still has much to offer and\nshould definitely not be avoided\nSunday 7th May\nMetalheadz @ Dingwalls; \u00a3 6\nStill going strong, this is probably still\nthe best drum'n 'bass club in the co un try. Make sure you try this at least once.\nTo have your club added to this list just\ninvite us along, we'll check it out and if\nwe like it we'll put it down\ne mail: music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nphone: 020 7594 8072 ask for Thorn\n\n"

    "content": "2 May 2000 \u2022 Felix Music\nfrequency N/\\ Keith Caputo\nDied Laughing\n(Roadrunner)\nRoadrunner Records, home to scary metal acts such as Slipknot, Coal\nChamber and Keith Caputo. Except Keith Caputo is neither scary, nor\nmetal and seems a bit out of place on Roadrunner's artists list. For those\nof you who do not know, he was the front man for popular metal act Life\nof Agony for ten years. Died Laughing, however, is somewhat different\nand may disappoint LOA fans. This album is more laid back. The anger\nhas gone and been replaced with gentler, more reflective songs.\nThe opening track, Honeycomb wouldn't seem out of place on a Feeder album, being a distorted-guitar pop-rock song with a chorus that you\ncan sing along to. The next few tracks are somewhat more relaxed, using\nthe traditional combination of clean guitars and strings to create typical\nsoft rock melodies. Although these songs are well written, they don't stand out and could quite easily serve the purpose of background music.\nJust about anyone can guess whom the song Cobain (Rainbow Deadhead) is about. One of the more notable songs on the album, it combines jazzy verses with louder, heavier choruses based around the refrain\n'Cobain was murdered by you'.\nJust Be is another catchy number which could quite easily be the theme\ntune to a children's television show. A spiky but friendly piano and\ndescending bass-line are accompanied by melodic vocals, but lyrics like\n\"numbskull, you are haemorrhaging\" clearly separate the anguish of a tortured rock star from The Raggy Dolls. The album ends on the ballad\nBrandy Duval, about his mother who died of a heroin overdose when\nKeith was only one year old. Again, orchestral instruments are used here\nto build the song into a fitting tribute.\nOne thing that I have always noticed about Keith Caputo is that he's got\na good voice. It worked well in Life of Agony, and it works just as well\non his solo work. This album contains songs that you'd probably expect\nto hear from someone like Paul Young (don't let that put you off), rather\nthan somebody who once fronted a heavy metal band. It's good for\nchilling out to after an energetic night out, although there are better\nalbums for this purpose. Sadly, although Died Laughing is suited for a wide audience, most people who might like it will probably never get a chance to hear it.\nDeath In Vegas\n@ The Forum, Kentish Town\nAfter bringing the house down and earning rave reviews (inducing on\nthese pages) after their autumn gig at the Shepherd's Bush Empire,\nDeath in Vegas' visit to the Forum was hugely anticipated. In the inter-im, their latest album, The Contino Sessions, has enjoyed considerable\nsuccess. Testament to their acceptance into the mainstream is the fact\nthat a single - Aisfia - has been used in that bastion of the middle-of-the-road, the background music for a TV advert. Yet the music hasn't in\nany way become more ordinary: in fact, very little has changed.\nGeneral exposure to the music meant that the crowd was more familiar\nwith the band's material, which noticeably improved the atmosphere at\nthe Forum. However, there were few other improvements since that gig\na few months ago. The deep reggae DJ's were the same; the crazy film\nprojections were the same; in fact, DiV played basically the same set.\nThe order was perhaps varied, but the tunes all came from the last\nalbum. Of course, this pleased the crowd just as much second time\naround.\nBut for those of us who saw the first performance, this latest one was\nultimately disappointing, since none of the guest vocalists from the\nalbum joined the band on stage. Deprived of the distraction of a singer,\nthe audience often was left wondering exactly what the blok es hidden\nbehind big boxes of electronics were actually doing. The confusion was\nexacerbated during the vocal tracks when we could hear singing,\ndespite the fact that there was plainly no vocalist anywhere near a microphone. It generated a strange distortion of our concept of reality,\nand left us asking ourselves what was really being performed and what\nwas coming off DAT.\nNo Bobbie Gillespe this time, not even Dot Allison and definitely no\nIggy Pop. In November, I counted 17 people on stage at one point:\nDiV's stage presence was certainly diminished (and not just numerical-ly) by this, although the enthusiasm of the crowd reinstated some energy to the proceedings. To be fair, the band did still manage to rock the\njoint. The music was as twisty as ever, with their trip py jams working the\ncrowd into a frenzy on several occasions. They command your attention\nlike any top act, and the question about what constitutes 'live' electronic\nmusic could be asked of many bands. Still, the gig left Felix with speculating as to what could have been....\nMinder Valmik\nThe Felix Music Team is ALWAYS looking for more writers, so if you're interested in contributing, we interested in having you.

Watch\nout for more details of when, where\nand how to buy your tickets coming\nvery soon.\nUnion Meetings Finally, the first ICU Council\nmeeting of the term takes place at\n6pm tonight (Tuesday 2nd May) in\nthe Union Dining Hall. See you\nthere.\nMASONIC MEDICS?\nThe question of whether or not the Medical\nSchool Union is to have a sabbatical president\nnext year, has not, at the time of writing been\nfinalised. Kevin suspects tonight's ICU Council\nmay shed some light on the matter. The scheduling of the meeting on the first day of term when\npeople will not be properly prepared or even\naware of it strikes Kevin as highly suspicious.\nOne of the possibilities for funding of the sabbatical has been sponsorship from the Freemasons. Members of the Med School Union leaving\nclosed meetings discussing the options have vigorously denied that this source of funding is\nbeing pursued.\nCHANGING TIMES?\nMany students would like the central library to\nadopt opening hours which are more in line with\nthe way that they work. Last year Dave Hellard\nmanaged to get the library to agree to experiment with Sunday opening. By using the library\non Sundays students demonstrated that there\nwas a demand for the extended hours and they\nhave now become permanent. No attempt to\ninstigate further improvements in the opening\nhours was made by ICU until the end of last\nterm, when discussions on extending opening\nhours were started. The library's response was to\nrequest proof, in the form of a petition, that\nextended hours were required. Furthermore,\nKevin has been told that the library has stated\nthat scope for improvement is limited due to the\nlibrary not being able to employ any more staff.\nAny extension of opening hours will have to be\nachieved by re-organising shift patterns and\novertime. The options are also limited as the\nlibrary is refusing to open without the issue desk,\ndespite the fact that this service is not essential\nout of normal hours.\nKevin wonders if the inability of the Union to\nnegotiate successfully in this situation, and having to resort to petitioning students, is a direct\nMishMash A Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nresult of the tiny proportion of students supporting the Union. If this is the case then it will\nbecome worse next year as the Union tries to\noperate with an even more pitiful mandate than\nit has had this year.\nHELLO HELLO HELLARRRRGH...\nThe Royal Parks Police are responsible for the\nsafety and security of Hyde Park as well as many\nof London's other parks. Kevin has rarely seen\nthem active, except for an excessive response\nmounted following a minor shunt between two\ncars on a park road and while vigorously enforcing their no-sparklers bylaws on bonfire night.\nThe Parks Police appear to be changing their\nimage. In an effort to become trendier, this summer roller b lading police will be patrolling the\nparks. This move comes in addition to dropping\nthe 'Royal' from their name when it is displayed\non their new four wheel drive vehicles. Kevin\nwonders how this will turn them into an effective\npolice force.\nANDROIDS WANTED\nThe company responsible for almost every link in\nthe chain of failures and bad decisions which\nlead to the computer problems in the city on the\nlast day of the tax year are still desperately trying\nto recruit Imperial graduates.\nKevin knows he is not the only student to\ncontinually get harangued by the company,\nwhich is apparently about four hundred people\nper year below its graduate recruitment targets\nfor the College. Thankfully, he is not alone in\nignoring their requests to come in and attempt to\nbrainwash groups of students either. One recent\nill-judged scam in their attempt to lure brilliant\nscientists and engineers into their inimitable\nbrand of jumped up accountancy was an offer of\n'summer jobs' starting next week.

    "content": "Travel Felix \u00bb 2 May 2000\nOH\nHaving succeeded in b lagging some grants and\nfound someone who was willing to put up with us\nfor a month and act as our chauffeur for the trip,\na group from IC's Caving Club set of for Morocco last September, equipped with the bare essen-ti als: our ex-RAF four-by-four, a minimal amount\nof caving equipment, and even less clothing. And\nwith that, we set off on our 2000 mile journey...\nArriving in Santander early the next morning,\nwe immediately started the two day slog across\nSpain, heading for the windsurfing mecca of Tarifa, where we took advantage of the cheap fuel\nand stocked-up on food and spirits. When I say\nwe, I mean Shed, Goaty, Clewin, Jan and Colm\n(all members of IC Caving) and Pete the driver (a50 year-old man whose ability to drive vast distances with little rest and only the occasional dram\nof whisky was unbelievable). The third and final\nleg of our journey started at 4am, driving to Algeceiras to catch the ferry to Tangier. The customs at\nTangier were extremely suspicious of the obviously military vehicle and started a thorough search,\neventually letting us go when they found some\nFrench literature on caves (and Pete slipped them\nsome fags).\nArriving in Marrakech late that night, our first\nmission was to locate some large scale maps of\nthe Atlas Mountains. Unfortunately they are very\nhard to get and we weren't lucky. Opting to go\nlooking for food instead, we headed for the\nDjeema Efina, a large square at the heart of Marrakech which is packed in the evenings with food-stalls selling soup, salads, meat, doughnuts and\nfruit - all you see whilst approaching arc crowds\nof people, and the smell and the smoke are the\nonly evidence of food. The stall holders shout at\npassers-by and each other, competing for custom,\nand all you have to sit on are rickety benches\naround the edges, squashed in with other people.\nThat night we headed out of Marrakech and\ncamped by the road - after all, we were here to\nget into the mountains and start exploring for\ncaves.\nThough a large amount of the Atlas are limestone (and therefore contain extensive cave net-work), we had three main target areas: Jbe\nAzourki, Plateau Des Lacs and the Dades and\nTodra gorges. We acquired some maps and\nbackground info whilst Goaty (our expedition\ngeologist) acquired some more info. Goaty was\nalso our expedition linguist (having been learning\nArabic for the past few months), but sadly his\nexpertise only stretched as far as useful phrases\nsuch as 'I don't know much Arabic', 'were are the\ncaves?' and 'how much for the little girl?'. However, by the end of the trip we had all mastered a little Arabic and the response we got from the\nlocals was always completely different as a result.\nThere are only two roads crossing the Atlas,\nso getting into the mountains was done on 'p is tes'( the rough tracks used by the Berbers) on donkeys\nand trucks which acted as a bus service for the\nlocals transporting produce to and from Souks.\nOur first camp was on a fairly busy route, with two\nor three trucks passing each day. Frequently, how-ever, the p is tes were washed away, and the only\nroute was to follow the river beds - on one occasion it took an entire day's driving to cover just\n40km, because the p iste followed a river bed\nstrewn with large boulders. Having spent the\nentire journey walking in front of our four-by-four,\nmoving rocks out of the way to avoid writing off\nour Landrover (or so we thought), we couldn't believe it when were passed by two Bedford trucks\nfull of people and piled with produce.\nThe large village we had arrived at was just\nfinishing its market day, which gave us a chance\nto stock up on vegetables. The enclosed market\nwas lined with hundreds of tiny shacks, selling\nabsolutely everything, including several butchers\nwho generally had various parts of goats and\nsheep hanging in the sun and engulfed by flies,\nwith the odd severed goats head lying on the\nground. We decided to stick to the fruit and ve g. Making enquiries over a Fanta at the local\ncafe, we were informed of a cave in the nearby\nhills. So, following brief directions given in French\nwe drove out the town in search of it. Not only did\nwe find the cave, but the camp spot was idyllic - a stream which came out of the nearby cliffs flowed\npast our site, and the valley bottom was a lawn of\ngrass dotted with trees. We made ourselves comfortable and spent the next few days exploring the\ncave and surrounding area, helped enormously\nby a couple of locals, who had been exploring the\ncave with torches and lamps. One of them told us\nof a passage that he had followed for ages without finding the end, which obviously intrigued us.\nWe exchanged addresses and promised to return\nto carry out a proper exploration of the cave.\nOur diet of tomato and pasta stew became a bit tedious after the second or third week, so we\ndecided to stop for a slap-up meal in next big\ntown we came to. This led to an unfortunate\nevent, as it soon became apparent that one of\nour group had food-poisoning, and he spent the\nwhole night throwing up anything he tried to s wal low. However, we soon forgot about it as there\nwere more important matters in hand - mainly\nbeer, as we were approaching a town where Pete\nassured us he could locate a hotel that sold real\nbeer. We strolled in very casually and took our\nplace on the veranda. Unbeknown to us, how ev er, there was trouble ahead, as one of our party\nwas having a relapse... While we waited to be\nserved he was leaning over the veranda, and with\nalmost comic timing he projectile vomited over\nthe waiter. Fortunately he missed the stonework,\nbut when we asked for our drinks we were told\npolitely but firmly that they did not sell beer. We\nmade our excuses and left.\nOur time in Morocco was running out, and\nwith the last couple of days we headed south to\nthe Sahara Desert. Pete was in his element, as he\nhad many friends and contacts in these parts. The\nnext few days were comparative luxury: we slept in\nBerber tents and were given guided tours of local\nk as bha hs, we took a camel ride to the edge of the\ndunes, and we spent one night camped under a completely full moon playing cards and drinking\nmint tea with local guides. The next day, our last\nfull day in Morocco, we watched the sunrise from\nthe top of an enormous sand dune. That evening\nwe were back in Marrakech, the next night Tarifa\nand finally, after seven days of travel, we arrived\nback in Plymouth.\n\n"

Everyone\nis now a little older but not wiser, as people are\nstill dropping like flies. When there are deaths\non the set, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell)\njoins up with the others including Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and Dewey Riley (David\nArquette). Eventually, after lots of suspense\nand thrills, the killer and the motives are\nrevealed. It's not a predictable ending. Instead\nit's quite sad and one classic of the director,\nWes Craven.\nThere was a lot of secrecy on the set of Scream\n3 and not even the cast knew who the killer\nwould be. This wasn't just Wes Craven being\nhis normal self but to stop a repeat performance of when some of the script from Scream\n2 appeared on the internet before the scene\nwas even shot. This movie provides a satisfactory end to the trilogy and it's a good thing\nthat Wes Craven has decided to stop making\nScream films before it got like Nightmare On\nElm Street.\nYou don't need to have seen any of the previous Scream's to enjoy this movie. It does help\nyou to follow the story, but is not essential.\nThere is plenty to laugh and jump at in this\nmovie. If you are a squeamish type, remember\nto take, someone with you to hold your hand\nand fill you in on the bits of story you will miss\ndue to hiding behind your hand.\nWatch this space next week for an interview\nwith director, Wes Craven and leading lady,\nNeve Campbell.\nOut On Video\nID Hele\nThe X Files: Closure\nClosure is a previously unseen (on both Sky\nand BBC), feature length episode of the X Files\nwhich marks the end of the mythology surrounding Mulder's sister Samantha. For those\nof you who are regular followers of the X Files,\nyou will know all about the hype surrounding\nSamantha's disappearance. This episode\napparently solves this issue but not to a very\nsatisfactory conclusion. At least not one suited\nto a college full of scientists.\nFox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) join forces with a police\npsychic to help solve the mysterious disappearance of a young girl. This brings back\nstrong emotions in Mulder which are connected to his sister. As the story goes on, more\ninformation is found out about Mulder's sister.\nAs would be expected, all the usual characters\nare involved including Cancer Man and Assistant Director Skinner.\nClosure has the same formula as any regular\nepisode of The X files. It's nothing special but\nif you are a huge fan, this episode will intrigue\nyou and answer some of those long standing\nquestions. 3 / 5\nX Files Competition\nThanks to Twentieth Century Fox, Screen has\nthree X Files: Closure videos. It has been out to\nbuy since 24 April but if you've put off buying it\ndue to lack of funds, answer the following question and you could get your hands on a copy\nfree of charge.\nWhat is the number of Agent Fox Mulder's apartment?\nE mail the answer to film.felix@ic.ac.uk before\n1 2pm on Friday and it could be you who owns\nan exclusive copy of X Files : Closure.\nscreen\\ Z3\n/ CU CINEMA What's On At ICU Cinema\nToy Story 2\nThis is the sequel to the amazing Toy Story. All the\nold characters are back, and the same actors as\nin the original Toy Story do all their voices. The\nnew characters are from \"Woody's Roundup\", a TV show in which Woody (the cowboy) starred\nduring the 1 950s. In it, his sidekick was the cowgirl Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), while his\nhorse was called Bullseye. Kelsey Grammar voices the final character, The Prospector, a kindly\nold fellow who is not all that he seems. The story\nrevolves around a malevolent toy collector, who\nkidnaps Woody so that he can make his collection of toys from \"Woody's Roundup\" complete,\nin order to sell them to a museum for lots of\nmoney. Of course, this leaves Buzz Lightyear and\nco to go and rescue Woody, while fighting a new\nenemy, Zurg. This film is definitely worth watching so get down to the cinema.\nThe Green Mile\nThis film is made by the same people that did\nThe Shawshank Redemption, and also it is based\non a Stephen King short story. The story is very\ndifferent in nature and, as only Stephen King is\nable to do, he conjures something incredibly\nintricate up out of the blue, and you have no\nidea how, when and where it is going to finish.\nThe story is set around a prison death row in\n1 930's Louisiana. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, the head guard who oversees and ultimately leads the prisoners to their punishment -which is death by the electric chair. Everything\nseems pretty normal, until a black prisoner\nnamed John Coffey, convicted of the gruesome\nmurder of a pair of young girls, arrives. Then, all\nof a sudden, you are whisked from normality,\nwhen the prisoner holds Edgecomb's meat and\ntwo ve g and performs a small miracle. A strange\nplot twist, I think you'll agree, and one that leaves\nhim understandably shocked. What ensues,\nhowever, is a captivating tale that combines stark\nreality with fantasy, surrounding a simple giant\nwhose special ability makes him frightened of the\nworld around him. Be warned though, this film is\nthree hours long!\n\n"

To be honest, I find the Sun's Tea\nBreak Quickie a bit taxing on the old grey\nmatter, so I always find Turnip Henry's offerings damnably tricky. And it's for the likes of\nme that he's once again provided a set of\nwhat he likes to describe as \"quick\" clues\n(hmmm... that just makes me feel thicker than\nthe large print version of The Lord of the\nRings). Either that or he's got terminally bored\nwith the prospect of revision - take your pick.\nAs ever, both sets of clues come with prizes\nattached for the first correct set of solutions\nout of the hat - just remember that, to ensure\nthat there's no cheating, the two sets of clues\nare for different words (yet both using the\nsame grid - clever, huh), so you're effectively\ngetting two puzzles for the price of one. Which\nis nice.\nSo, anyway, back to the normal spiel... put\ndown your notes and the painfully boring text\nbook (you know you want to) and ignore the\nhideously attired man at the front of the room\ntalking about partial different i a! equations\n(where do they get those ties?). Instead, dig\nout a dictionary, locate a sharp pencil (and a sharper mind) and set to work one of the puzzles (not both at the same time, mind - that\nX ross word Competition way madness lies).\nIn order to be in with a chance of winning,\nyou'll need to bring your completed grid to the\nFelix Office (outside the Physics Department,\nnext to the liquid nitrogen tank) by 8pm on\nWednesday evening (preferably accompanied\nby a full set of correct answers). Oh, and it'd help matters a lot if you indicate clearly which\nset of clues you've used.\nThe first correct grid of answers to the\ncryptic clues will win their owner a copy of the\nCollins English Dictionary (RRP \u00a320), whilst a full set of solutions to the quick crossword\ncould earn you a \u00a3 1 0 book token. The names\nof the lucky winners will be printed here next\nweek, along with a full set of answers to both\ncrosswords.\nRight, just one thing left to do... The final\ncrossword of last term produced the usual\nstream of entries, with a particularly high\nnumber of solutions for the quick crossword\nmaterial ising in the Felix Office just minutes\nbefore the competition deadline, all looking\nsuspiciously similar... Anyway, after weeding\nout all the incorrect answers (the correct\nwords are listed above), the first set of cryptic\nanswers out of the hat belonged to Will\nBlackman, whilst the winner of the quick\ncrossword contest was Amy Hollister. Congratulations - please come to the Felix Office\nto collect your prizes as soon as possible.\n\n"

    "content": "32 Sport Felix \u00ab 2 May 2000\nThey came, they saw, they streaked through Paris Cross Country - Paris Relays 2000\nIts that time of year again when\nthe cross country team decide to\nblow the budget in Paris. There\nwere only two objectives of the trip\nthis year. The first was to get drunk\nfor three days and the second was\nto win the naked 4-by-400 relay.\nAll the London colleges congregated at ULU on Thursday\nnight for a couple of social drinks\nbefore the coach journey out to\nParis. As always, the journey was a rowdy one, with Kings Beer Fag\nArmy leading all the chants\n(including a55min rendition of\nChicago). This led one of the\nImperial girls (Sarah, a feminist\nYank) who had only been dragged\nin at the last minute, to complain\ncontinuously to the whole of the\nteam. Oh well... The ferry journey\nwas enlivened by Andy G swiping\na hostess's hat when she came to\nthrow us out of the club lounge.\nAnyhow, after we arrived on\nFriday we went on the usual sight\nseeing tour of Paris, which ended\nwith a club meal at which Sarah\ncomplained loudly (you may have\nspotted a pattern).\nSaturday saw the strength of\nthe team increase, as three extra\nrunners turned up at the last\nminute. The Paris Relay (the reason we are meant to go) was held\nin the afternoon, with Imperial\nforced to borrow a group of\nfemales from UAE (with them borrowing some of our men in\nreturn).\nThe race itself was uneventful\n- we hadn't come here to win and\nwe didn't, with the first team finishing eleventh. Shaun should get\na mention, however, for running\nthe eight fastest time of the day in\nhis first outing for Imperial. The\npost race celebrations started\nimmediately, however, with some\nserious beer fights. The team then\nmoved onto the more serious reasons for coming to Paris.\nAt 2.30am the naked 4-by-400 started. Andy G ran a storming leg came in first and handed\nonto Andy H, who ran a great leg\nand was only beaten home by the\nNottingham runner who started\n50m down the track and cut all\nthe corners off (you cheating\nb* star ds). Ga v took over but was\nunable to haul in the Nottingham\nrunner and handed over to\nMcDangerous, who closed the\ngap but was unable to complete\nthe victory. Nottingham were\nannounced as the winners, but\nonly by the judge who came from\n- you guessed it - Nottingham. All\nthe other teams disqualified Nottingham and Imperial were once\nagain crowned Kings of the\nNaked 4-by-400.\nThe night continued, and Frank Boucher had a hell of a time at the party. After repeatedly\nsaying he did not like the moaning\nfeminist, he vanished to her room.\nHe claims she asked him for sex\nand that he said no, but the general consensus is that his new\nname (Mister Floppy) might have\nhad something to do with it...\nA fantastic weekend was had\nby all, and we arrived back at ULU\nlate on Sunday evening - what a way to finish the season off. On to\nthe athletics season now - and all\nthat remains is to see if Mike can\nkeep his progression going: thirteen year olds to incessantly\nmoaning American feminists to...?\nUnited make it six from eight but is that enough? Premiership League Review\nManchester United have taken the\nPremiership title for the sixth time in\nthe league's eight year history - yet\nafter only reaching the last eight of\nthe Champions League and performing miserably in the World Club\nChampionship, is that enough?\nWith the title wrapped up so\nearly this season, Alex Ferguson\nsurely only views the Premiership as\na way back into Europe next season\n- after all, it's only through continued success on the European stage\nthat United will be able to conclusively prove themselves to be one of\nthe greatest teams of all time. Until\nthen, no matter what an endless\nsuccession of BBC and Sky Sports\ncommentators proclaim them to\nbe, they will still remain an impossibly wealthy yet quickly forgotten\nteam.\nHence, you have to assume,\nthe decision to spend \u00a318.5 million\non Ruud Van Nistelrooy. That and\nthe fact that Liverpool have picked\nup just three points less than United\nsince Christmas (it was just one\npoint until they ran out of steam\nagainst Everton on Good Friday),\nand the one thing that the Mersysiders definitely aren't short of is\nstrike force (unlike Chelsea and\nArsenal, who have fallen away from\nthe leaders largely thanks to an\ninability to put the ball in the back\nof the net). So, with the prospect of\nLiverpool mounting a serious challenge next year (assuming that they\ncan hold onto all of their players\nand keep them injury free), and,\nmore importantly, with the Champions League kicking off again in five\nmonths time, making a few\nimprovements to the starting eleven\nis clearly essential. However, with\nMartin Edwards insisting that some-one's going to have to leave in\norder to balance the books, a nice\nbig argument between the Chairman and his short-of-fuse Manager\nmay well be on the horizon - and\nthat certainly won't be good for the\nshare price...\n\n"

    "content": "24 Books Felix * 2 May 2000\nbooks jol nn px* es*t on WHILE I'J Vt DEAD.. FEED THE Ink\nJohn Preston\n1989. Fleet Street is being abandoned by the last\nof the papers still based there. Hugh Byrne, a reporter at one, is on the verge of cracking up,\nseeming to have lost the ability to write. A throwaway story about a man found dead in the\nThames offers him his last chance before his\nimpatient News Editor makes him bring the\nQueen Mother's obituary up to date. Ink follows\nHugh's investigations into the drowned man as\nthe paper winds up its offices and prepares to\nmove to Canary Wharf, weaving a shadowy tale\nof secrets, lies and newsprint.\nPreston paints a dark picture of a traditional newspaper operation, from the rows of hacks at typewriters in the offices, to the nightmarish depths of\nthe printing presses and Byzantine politics of the\nbuilding. It seems a world away from the modern\nworld of desktop publishing, and it's hard to fathom how much has changed in ten years.\nThe novel itself works well. Blackly comedic, yet\nabsorbing and intricate, it's stylishly written and\nthought provoking. There's a strong sense of isolation and dejection in Hugh's thoughts and\nlifestyle, which adds depth and intensity to the\ncharacter is ation. The other characters tend to be\na little vague, although most are complex and\nrealistic. Hugh's development and awakening is\nwell portrayed, contrasting with the simultaneous\ndecline of the paper. The plot is slick, and the\ntwists are only partly revealed in the conclusion,\nwhich is itself a little ambiguous. The emphasis is\nnot so much on finishing the story as on the culmination of Hugh's escape from the problems that\nhaunt him throughout. .It's not perfect - it doesn't quite hang together, and there's a suspicion that\nsome elements are there for the sake of a joke, or\nto sneer at some journalistic stereotypes (Preston\nis the Daily Telegraph's Arts Editor). Overall,\nthough, this is well worth a read; unusual, accomplished and grimly fascinating.\nWhile I'm Dead Feed the Dog\nRic Browde\nRic Brodie spent most of his childhood travelling\naround Europe and America, before settling\ndown to an unsuccessful rock career. To make\nends meet he managed brothels, directed porn\nfilms, produced records and teaching English to\nforeigners (the latter not being as wholesome as\nit perhaps sounds). So what does the singer/gui-tar is t of The Amateur Gynaecologists have to\nwrite about?\nWhile I'm Dead Feed The Dog is set in a sleepy\nsuburb of St Louis, Missouri, where nothing ever\nhappens. This is until the sixteen year old Ric\nThibault is corrupted by a leopard-skin bikini\nclad David Bowie promoter and his mother's best friend (who also happens to be his best\nfriend's mother). From here Ric starts on his conquest to seduce the most beautiful girl in the\nworld, Nina Pennington.\nOf course, there are a few obstacles in the way;\na couple of dead Latin teachers, a father in the\nMafia, being forced to tour with David Bowie\nand his mother leaving him a goodbye note\nreading \"While I'm dead: Feed The Dog\" after\nher first suicide attempt. Ric is caught in a whirlwind of hype which takes him to near stardom\nduring the seventies by simply loosing his virginity (albeit in impressive style).\nBrodie describes the book as \"totally autobiographical except for all the bits where I lied\" and\nI hope he lies a lot! With seven deaths and too\nmany sexual encounters to count, this book\nmoves along quickly and is an incredibly easy\nread. This novel would definitely appeal to some\none with a slightly darker sense of humour; in\nfact if you are of a more sensitive nature I would\nadvise you to avoid it altogether. All in all, While\nI'm Dead Feed Tthe Dog is a light, shallow and\nraunchy novel with a story line which gradually\nprogresses further and further from this world.\nCreating a' WebPage Fourth Edition The Complete Idiot's Guide to\nCreating a Web Page\nYou've got to admit that this is not really going\nto appeal to any of us, I am afraid to say. Most\nof us who do care probably already know quite\na bit of HTML, and don't want to be (what we\nsee as) patronised by an 'idiot's' guide. And\nthose of us who don't care, don't care.\nAh',I hear you say. 'What happened to journalistic impartiality?' Well, okay. For the person\nwho is an idiot, and does want to write a web\npage (let's say an Oxford 'computing' student),\nthis book would be very handy. It is a continuation of the famous Idiot's Guide series, and as\nsuch, it is extremely simple to read, taking you\nthrough the steps in a relatively rational f ash ion. But is this really sufficiently simple for\nidiots? Take, for example, my mother. She's a lovely woman, but no idea about computers. If\nI were to show her this book she would probably cry - but I have to say that I think even she\nwould be able to cotton onto this (once she\nsummoned up the courage to open the cover).\nThe style is informal, which is clearly very\nimportant in this kind of book, and everything\nis explained in detail which, although sometimes excruciating for someone with computer\nknow-how, truly is idiot-proof. However, this is\nnot a short book, and there is certainly a learning curve: later chapters in the book deal with\nJava-script and image mapping. Nonetheless,\nif you already know a bit of HTML, and aren't scared of it, you would probably benefit from\nbuying a more advanced book.\nSo, all in all, if you're not too tech ie parents/\nfriends/you are thinking of going into the web-business, then this is definitely a good book to\nbuy. For someone less scared of computers,\nhowever, one could spend money on a book\nequally as big, but with much more in form a tion.\nID Gareth ID Guy IDD Will\n\n"

    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 2 May 2000\nfrequency> A... And I begin as I should have\nleft off by saying sorry for being a bit rubbish at times last term. For\nvarious reasons, I wasn't able to\nput much time into these pages\nlast term and although music\nnever missed an issue, we sure\nwere a lot less organised than we\nshould have been. So sorry. I also\nthought about a polo gi sing for the\ndrivel that often appears in this\ncolumn. Then, all of sudden, I changed my mind. I decided that\nthese were worthy of the space\nthat we give them, and although\nit's not always about music, it's not as totally irrelevant as I once\nthought.\n... frequency...\nhere comes the sun\nSo now I feel I must say a few\nwords about music. The summer\nis usually an excellent time for the\nrelease of new music. Indeed it is\noften music that defines the summer of a given year. We all\nremember Whigfied's awful Saturday Night and the dance moves\nthat went along with it. Jason\nNevin's mix of Run DMC' s It's Like That was also a summer\nsong that seemed to play wherever I went. This leads me to think:\nWho will be producing the song\nof this summer? I suppose it's going to have to be a garage\ntune with the way music has been\ngoing recently, which brings me\nto the new MJ Cole album.\nReviewed in Felix this week, his\nnew single is a cracker and if this\nis anything to go by expect a few\nmore super tracks from him over\nthe summer. My advice to you is\nto keep listening hard.\nMethods of Mayhem\nMethods of Mayhem\n(MCA)\nYou know, I'm sure Tommy Lee's everyone's hero. Or he\nwould be if he weren'ta wife-beating dick. I'm afraid that his\nattitude and mentality has transferred straight to CD. \"Jumping on the bandwagon\" is the phrase that pays for\nMethods Of Mayhem. Following the recent slew of hiphop\nmetal fusion bands like Korn, Deftones, Slipknot et al, it was\nonly a matter of time before a member of a flagging band\nfrom the cock-rock era decided his bank balance needed a boost. It's all loud guitars, pounding beats and a little too\nmuch swearing. Hey, swearing's cool, we all know that, but\ntoo much makes it seem Tommy Lee and crew (note the correct spelling, Mr. Lee) have only just learned how to. It does-n't make you hard, it makes you puerile.\nThe subject matter is a bit dod gy too: sex and violence - those\nstaples of rock and hiphop - get too much attention. \"But\nsurely Tommy Lee's a red-blooded male and all he thinks\nabout are sex and violence\" you may shout. Then he should\nstick to releasing singles, few and infrequent. It gets boring\nafter a few minutes.\nAnd what's with all these collaborations? Lee and TiLo make\nthe backbone of MOM but they don't seem to have the stamina for a whole album. They've had to get their mates in to\nshore them up, from Kid Rock to Snoop Dogg. Some make a worthwhile contribution while others muddy up an already\nless than crystal clear mix.\nI guess if you're a regular reader of Metal Hammer then you'd be pretty pleased with Methods Of Mayhem, its chugging riffs\nand relentless thumping drums would be right up your street.\nBut most of us like a little variation within our music and\nthere's only a couple of tracks here that even hint at a light at\nthe end of that particular tunnel. New Skin has a White Zombie / Zombie feel to it with a fairly mellow, tuneful chorus and\nCrash is decent industrial metal in the Fear Factory mould. It's not enough though. Methods Of Mayhem is a thoroughly\ncrap album. It's offensive, childish, embarrassing and an\nexercise in how not to be taken seriously.\nLes Rhythmes Digitales\nLive In Belgium\n(Wall of Sound)\nLike Ronseal's quick-drying wood stain, this does exactly what it says on the tin. A Les Rythmes Digitales gig. In Belgium.\nBasically.\nSo you get eight songs, which are all (as\nfar as I know) from the recent 'Dark-dancer' album, interspersed with some\nWalloon-y whooping. Whether you like it\nall depends on whether you dig songwriter\nJacques Lu Cont's singular vision of what\nmusic should resemble right now.\nOn paper, LRD seem to be the shit test band in the world. This lot are obsessed\nwith the Eighties at a time when most\nbands are either looking to the Sixties or\nthe future. The influence of that most\nunfashionable of decades means that the\nunashamedly manufactured sounding\nsongs are built out of tinny drum-machines, synthesizers, robotic vocals and\n(if you've ever seen a picture of them) an\natrocious dress sense.\nIn reality though, it's all rather good.\nSometimes even ace. Which is surprising,\nbecause it veers close to being unbelievably cheesy almost all the time, yet still\nretains its credibility. The squealing synth\nriff in 'Jacques Your Body' is worth the\nasking price alone, and the brilliant bouncy basslines, provided by Jacques himself,\nprovide a good solid base. But if you've\ngot the album already, why would you\nwant to purchase this? Apart from the\nsound of the enthusiastic crowd and some\ncheekily thrown in riffs from hits from the\nEighties, there's nothing much new. One for the comp let is t only.\nChristian Kunal\n\n"

    "content": "30 Clubs & Societies Felix \u2022 2 May 2000\nMountaineering Club GARETH MORGAN The Imperial College Mountaineering Club's Easter tour took us to\nSpain's Gold Coast, the Costa Daurada in Catalonia, for a week and a half of stunning climbing in fabulous scenery.\nThe trip started in patriotic style,\nwith a late-night viewing of The Italian Job, which took the place of\nsleep before the 7.00 flight from\nStanstead to Barcelona. We spent\nmost of the holiday quoting it, especially after picking up the blue,\nwhite and (unfortunately) green\nClios that would be our transport in\nSpain (\"Remember, over here they\ndrive on the wrong side of the\nroad\"). One of these, incidentally,\nwould be thrashed to within an inch\nof its life over mountain roads and\ndirt tracks, \"because it's a hire car,\nand they expect it to be trashed.\"\nOne car stayed in Barcelona to\npick up two latecomers, while the\nothers drove to the mountain refuge\nin the ruined village of La Mussara,\nwhich was to be our home for the\nnext ten days. The refuge provided\nimpressive views over the mountains\nto the coastal town of Reus, with the\nMediterranean stretching away over\nthe horizon. Run by a Catalan cou-ple, it provided basic accommodation and good food for a few\npounds a night. Our two Spanish\nspeakers, Martin and Alban, spent a long time talking to Maria, our\nyoung hostess. Her boyfriend, possibly called Mario, seemed nice\nenough too; he climbs F8a (read,\nseriously hard) and puts up a lot of\nnew routes. Which was a shame.\nThe climbing started in earnest\non Sunday, with a trip to the nearby\nTV crags, named after the masts on\nthe hill above them. The rock here is\na hard limestone, often covered in\nsharp pockets or protrusions that\nmake for great technical climbing.\nOn the other hand, anyone who\ninsisted on wearing shorts whatever\nthe weather ended up with knees\ncovered in cuts and grazes. This\ndidn't slow us down though, as\neveryone set about the rock with a determination caused by a long,\ncold English winter. Everything here\nis sports climbing - bolts drilled into\nthe rock provide a more secure and\nregular form of protection than traditional British routes - so we\nclimbed as hard as we could without quite the same risks we would\nexpect at home. There was a fair\namount of exposure though, the\nalmost instinctive unease that affects\nmost people when they're above\nthe ground. Hanging on by one\nhand while you look down two\nthousand feet of valley, going all the\nway down to the distant sea, is an\ninteresting experience, generally\naccompanied by muttered expletives and a strong motivation to\nkeep going.\nThinking of the weather, anyone\nwho had been expecting balmy sun\nand the chance to really work on\ntheir tan was sorely disappointed -we were a thousand metres above\nsea level and it was extremely cold\nat times. The wind didn't help - it\ncertainly didn't seem to have come\nfrom the Sahara. Still, when we\nfound a bit of shelter, it was a beautiful location.\nWe had three days of great\nclimbing, the highlight of which was\na stunning F7a+ are te led by Simon\nand Mike on a crag called Lo Soterrani, although everyone was pushing their abilities and a lot of great\nroutes were climbed. Unfortunately,\nwe were now collectively tired, and\ndecided that a rest day in Tarragona, the nearest city, was called for.\nWe went medium in Reus (which, on\na Tuesday at least, was too dead to\ngo large), and got shouted at for\nbeing noisy when we returned at\nhalf past two. We returned via Reus,\nand picked up our esteemed President, Megan, and some random\nslap per by the name of Nigel, who\nhad come to catch the second half\nof the trip.\nWe headed out to the picturesque village of Mont Ral on Thursday, and managed a couple of\nroutes before the heavens opened\nand we were reduced to huddling in\na cafe, cursing the filthy foreign\nweather. Friday was much nicer, and\nwe managed a good few routes on\nthe TV crags.\nFriday night presented something of a problem. The Catalonia\nRally was being held in the area,\nand the refuge had been booked by\naround sixty locals for a pre-race\nparty, leaving us with no option but\nto go clubbing in Tarragona. After a pizza, a few beers, and several jugs\nof sangria, we were ready to go. But\nwait! Look! A playground with those\nwooden toys on springs to play on!\nNice. Unfortunately, someone had\nto fall off, and Nigel took on this\nsolemn responsibility not once but\ntwice, losing a fair bit of skin from\naround his eyes, which left him\nlooking like he'd been in a series of\nbrutal fights. Pausing only to pick up\nan ice pack, we stumbled across a row of a dozen clubs, thronging\nwith people and playing a wide\nselection of music. Shame that most\nof them didn't like trainers. Despite\nthis we had a great night, and\nweren't too bothered about the\nprospect of sleeping in the cars for\na few hours afterwards.\nThe roads were closed for the\nRally on Saturday, so we had a nice\nafternoon on some nearby crags\nthat made up in route quality what\nthey lacked in height. Sunday was\nan expedition to Villanova de\nPrades, which had different rock\nand lots of nice short routes. Unfortunately our trusty Rockfax let us\ndown and we spent so long trying to\nfind the crag that we only managed\na couple of routes before the cloud\ncame down, the wind picked up,\nand we retreated to a cafe. All\nexcept Nigel and Gareth, who\nproved themselves to be the least\nsane but most hardcore of us all,\nclimbing a reasonably hard route in\nludicrously high winds. That night\nwas Megan's21st birthday, which\ncalled for a suitable celebration:\ncocktails, tequila and general hilarity. The precise details are lost in a haze of alcohol and dire threats, but\na fine night was had by all.\nMonday was our last day of\nclimbing, and we tried to make the\nmost of it, with some great routes\nthat left everyone tired but reluctant\nto leave. After a truly fantastic meal\nand the last of our beer, we left the\nrefuge on Tuesday and made our\nway back to Barcelona. It had been\na fantastic few days, leaving us\nlooking forward to a long summer\nof climbing back in Britain.\nFor more information on the\nmountaineering club, and our summer trips, contact Megan at the\naddress below.\nContact: Megan\nEmail:mountaineering@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n2 May 2000 : Issue 1173\nThis is a subliminal message: vote for the manon the right Po qe4 A lPo cino talks about Any Given Sunday\nSouthside renovation faces setback GARETH MORGAN The planned redevelopment of the\nSouthside halls of residence has\nbeen postponed \"until mid 2 0 0 1 \" ,\nafter a reassessment of the project\nby Imperial College Estates.\nThe delay was announced at a meeting of College Council at the\nend of last term. The project as a whole has not been delayed,\naccording to John Walsh, the\nAssistant Director of Projects in the\nEstates Department, only the construction itself. There will be a greater \"lead in\" time, which will\nallow the project to be planned in\nfiner detail. This, in turn, will\nimprove the efficiency of the construction and allow for contracting\nto be finalised before building\nwork starts.\nEstates are currently reviewing\nthe timescale for the construction\nin light of the improved planning,\nand hope to minimise the period\nfor which the halls are out of com-mission. This means that only\nWillis Jackson House, in Evelyn\nGardens, is due to undergo renovation in the next academic year,\neasing the pressure on spaces in\nhalls and allowing the College to\nfulfil its promise to offer accommodation to all first year under-graduates.\nPart of Estates' rationale in\ndelaying the Southside project was\nto \"safeguard our financial expo-sure\", as there are several socalled \"capital projects\" underway,\nincluding the refurbishment of the\nSouthside: open for another year\nSenior Common Room and the\nconstruction of the Multi-Disciplinary Research Building (MRDB).\nImperial College's recently-pub-li shed Annual Report includes\ndescriptions of these and other\nplanned projects, but the Southside redevelopment is not listed;\nneither are the other \"rolling refurbishments\" of Imperial's halls of\nresidence.\nBeryl Castle, College's Director of Finance, denied rumours\nthat financial problems were to\nblame for the changes, as the\nprojects were never intended to be\nfunded directly from College\nfunds. Indeed, in his introduction\nto the Annual Report the Rector,\nLord Oxburgh, states that progress\n\"will depend on our ability to find\nPhoto: Dave\naround \u00a3200 million outside the\nCollege\". Ms Castle stated that the\ncapital projects were proceeding\naccording to the College's long-term plans, citing the MRDB as a prime example of a development\nthat is working well.\nHowever, the introduction of a new, \u00a3 6 million finance system\nappears to have caused some\nshort-term cash flow difficulties.\nDue to problems integrating the\nnew system with existing administration systems, there have been\ndelays in processing the tuition\nfees bills, which were not sent out\nuntil December. Since fees and\nsupport grants from Local Education Authorities accounted for \u00a334\nmillion last year, some 10% of the\nCollege's turnover, the delay in\ntheir receipt caused a temporary\ndeficit when staff expenses were\npaid each month. The problem\nwas compounded by the decision\nto pay off around \u00a33 million of\ndebts last July to ease the transfer\nto the new system. Although there\nhave been no serious losses, and\nthe finances are set to recover as\ndebts are paid, the lack of capital\nhas reduced the profits made by\ninvesting surpluses.\nMeanwhile, the renovation of\nBeit Hall looks likely to finish\nslightly later than scheduled,\nalthough Estates are \"still looking\nto maintain the end date\", according to Mr Walsh. The delays are\nassociated with the problems of\nworking with old buildings, but are\nunlikely to prolong the work greatly beyond the target of 1 July. Mr Walsh said that work on the base-ment s, which are to be developed\nby Imperial College Union, should\nnot be delayed.\nContracts are \"currently being\nsigned\" for the first stage in the\nRoyal School of Mines makeover,\nthe conversion of Level 4 into new\noffices. An \"in-house strategy for\nthe whole building\", rather than\nthe initial plan of renovating everything at once, is now favoured.\nAlthough this will still cost tens of\nmillions of pounds and take several years, it is less expensive and\ndisruptive than the alternative. The\ncosts have been inflated by the\nneed to maintain the front of the\nlisted building, which faces Prince\nConsort Road.\n\n"

    "content": "2 May 2000 \u00ab Felix Clubs & Societies 31\nSinfonietta IC Sinfonietta's second evening\nconcert of the year took place at the\nend of last term, with all those\ninvolved hoping to build on the\nundoubted success of their first per-form ance, which took place last\nautumn.\nFor their first piece, the Sinfonietta selected Tchaikovsky's Violin\nConcerto. They were joined by Elizabeth Cooney, a Foundation Scholar at the Royal School of Music. She\nperformed with great aplomb,\nbringing out the lyrical solo sections\nof the first movement. During these\nmoments the audience listened in\nawed rapture, scarcely daring to\nbreathe lest they missed a nuance.\nThe orchestra shone too, performing with clarity and purpose, especially in the later movements. The\nfinal movement, Allegro\nviva a's simo, was a rapid sequence\nof folk-dances, in which the main\ntheme was supported by bagpipe-style droning and an evocation of\nthe gypsy string bands which were\npopular in Tchaikovsky's Russia.\nThis was as fine a musical performance as this reviewer has ever witnessed from IC Sinfonietta.\nAfter the interval, the orchestra\nprepared to do battle with (K) ein\nSommernachtsiraum, (Not) A Midsummer Night's Dream. The piece\nbegan simply enough with some\nto ing and-fro ing between two simple tunes, one on piano and violin,\nthe other on flute and harpsichord.\nLater apparent chaos ensued as the\ntheme is repeated by the strings a beat apart, accompanied by the\nflutes in a different key. It is fair to\nsay that this sounded odd. In fact\nmany of the audience laughed\nopenly. A lengthy section followed in\nwhich the strings introduced a relatively sane waltz like theme, only to\nhave in thrown back in their faces by\nthe brass and winds as a thunderous \"oom-pah\" march. This piece\nworked well both as a musical performance and as a comic episode.\nCongratulations are due to conductor Daniel Capps who held together\nthe disparate rhythms admirably.\nFinally, after some shuffling and\nrearrangement, we were treated to\nMalcolm Arnold's Four Scottish\nDances. This composer has worked\non films including Wildcat's of St.\nTrinians and The Bridge on the River\nKwai. His Scottish Dances include a Strathspey, a reel, a particularly\nenjoyable Hebridian folk tune and a Highland Fling. The orchestra clearly relished the familiar timbres and\nmusical language of Scottish music,\nand gave a fun interpretation of the\npiece.\nIC Sinfonietta has been running\nfor three and a half years, and until\nthis year it was kept under the wing\nof the Symphony Orchestra. Its\nmany free lunchtime concerts were\nwell attended, but as the orchestra\ngrew bigger and better it needed to\nperform to a wider audience. For\nmore information on joining the\nSinfonietta or forthcoming concerts,\ncontact Chris at the address below.\nContact: Chris\nEmail: sinfonietta@ic.ac.uk\nRock Soc EL GORDO Okay, to those of you who didn't attend \"The sICk night In\", would you\nbe so kind as to form an orderly line\nby that wall over there, yes, the one\npitted with lead, clotted hair and\nmucus. Lovely.\nSaturday 1 8th March saw London's biggest student rock and metal\nnight in the Union, attracting students\nfrom as far out. as Surrey and\nUxbridge, in addition to all the major\nLondon universities. Having almost\nbeen cancelled twice and been\nmoved from DBs to the Concert Hall,\n\"The sICk night In\" was put together\nin a mere two and a half weeks of\nhard work by a crack team from the\nIC RockSoc, DramSoc and the Union\nBar. The result was best characterised\nat the end of the night by brain\nstunned people asking for more (and\noffering to bear our children, nice).\nThe night kicked off a little after\nthe advertised 6pm, due to unforeseen technical difficulties concerning\ncustard and rice cri spies, with a selection of DJs from ICUs very own\nRockSoc, in its first year as an official\nsociety. RCM-based band Element\nwere first to play at 7pm, regaling us\nwith excellent renditions of a selection of classic songs.\nThe second band were exciting\nup comers in the London hard-core\nscene, RD.H.M.( no, we haven't got a clue as to what it stands for either).\nThe rapping brothers, Stuart and\nAlistair, burst onto the stage in a wild\nfrenzy of un constrained energy never\nbefore seen in IC and with their performance the first mosh pit of the\nevening quickly got underway, with a stage froth flailing of limbs and hair.\nRedHed were next on. With already\none Kerrang! feature under the belt,\nwe knew we were in for a treat. With\nan awesome stage presence, they\nhad the audience eating out of their\nhands with their guitar y Stuck Mojo\nsound, singing along in no time.\nStonking.\nThe fourth band, on at\n1 1 :30pm, were Evil Kneval. This\nband is already very known for playing support for major bands around\nthe UK. However no amount of\npreparation can prepare a person for\nthe \"my one is bigger than your one,\noh look, I 'll whip it out and show\nyou\" band debate. The music was\npretty cool too...\nHeadlining the night were Zeta\nReticuli. With a fantastic entrance,\nthe devil-winged front man Gary\nwooed the audience with eerily\nheartfelt tracks and a refreshing fast\nmoving sound.\nRemember kids, you don't have\nto worship Satan to join RockSoc, but\nit does help and he is your friend.\nThe date for \"The bigger, longer and\nuncut sICk night In\" has already set\nfor Freshers Week 2000 - put a note\nin your diary and be there OR ELSE...\nContact: James\nEmail: rock soc@ ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Lotus is\nnice enough, but it's nothing to get excited\nabout. Maybe I'm missing something, but\nprobably not.\nToni Braxton\nHe Wasn't Man Enough\n(Arista)\nWith the quality of r'n' b tunes rising\nall the time, it's getting harder and\nharder to get onto those much\ndesired radio playlists. However, this\nlatest offering from Toni Braxton has\nhad no trouble elbowing the competition out of the way. She may have\nbeen away for four years, but there's been no loss of talent and with any\nluck her forthcoming album should\ncontain a few more gems.\nMJ Cole\nCrazy Love\n(Talkin' Loud)\nI think if you told me a year ago that\nI'd be looking forward to the release\nof a garage album, I would have told\nyou that you were insane. Anyway, for\nsome strange reason garage has\nreally grown on me recently and the\nmusic of MJ Cole is no exception.\nCrazy Love is an excellent single from\nthe top end of the garage spectrum\nand I 'll be first in the queue when the\nalbum drops in a few weeks time.\nID Hanson\nIf Only\n(Mercury)\nHow can you not laugh at\nHanson? I mean, just\nlook at them. I suppose\nthey do what they do\nquite well, but it's not\nreally music to fulfil the\nbody or mind. There is,\nhowever, a lot of comedy\nassociated with the Hanson boys, and as one of\nthe CDs comes with a free poster this could be\nworth buying for something new to stick of your\ndartboard.\nCalexico\nBallad of Cable Hogue\n(City Slang)\nSometimes, you just\ncan't beat a good bal-lad. Stan Ridgeway's Camoflague was a firm\nfavourite of mine when I was younger. This single\nis in the country and\nwestern style, with all the\nusual touches, and, as\nsuch, makes a nice\nchange from the rest of\nthis weeks singles. I suppose the C&W style\ncould put a lot of people off, but this is def in it ley worth checking.\nFunkstar De Luxe vs. Terry Max\nWalkin' In The Name\n(Edel)\nFunkstar De Luxe was the guy who\nbrought us the undeniably excellent\nremix of Bob Marley's Sun is Shining. Walkin' In The Name is not\nquite up to the same standard, but\nthat's not say that this should be\navoided. The beat keeps your head\nbouncing and the lyrics are easy\nenough to pick up, so don't be surprised if you're singing this out\naloud in the for rth coming weeks.\nUtah Saints\nFunky Music\n(Echo)\nSong titles should in general give an\nimpression of what a song is about\nor what it sounds like. The Utah\nSaints classic that we all know and\nlove was called Something Good\nand good it was indeed. Funky\nMusic, their latest comeback single\nis neither funky nor is it particularly\nmusical. So I suggest a trip to a vocabulary school (or better still a retirement home) is about due for\nthese self claimed Saints.\nCuban Boys\nInertia Kicks\n(EMI)\nI don't understand the\nmotivation behind these\nCuban Boys singles.\nThe chorus is a self\ndefacing chant of\n\"we're just a bunch of\nlosers\" (which makes a change from hamsters),\nbut the construction is\nso basic and obvious\nthat after just a few listens I'm bored and\nwant more. I think I preferred the hamsters.\n...Singles reviews\nby Felix...\n\n"

Screen was\nlucky enough to have an opportunity to talk to the\nman himself and what follows is what we found out.\nAre you a big fan of American football?\nI don't know it as well as I know baseball but I have\nplayed as a youngster. The game has changed\nnow. I don't know the inner workings of it but I enjoy watching it.\nThere are about a hundred speaking parts in Any\nGiven Sunday. You're the lead so is that anything\nlike being the quarterback on a successful team.\nA football player told me once in my research that\nplaying quarterback is like going in the opposite\ndirection on the freeway in LA with the traffic coming at you and reading Hamlet at the same time.\nDo you think American football players deserve the\nhuge salaries they get?\nWhen one looks into the life span of an athlete and\ntakes into account the kind of money generated by\nplaying the game, you have to step back and determine what you think. I do believe athletes are paid\nwhat they generate. It's a dangerous game. I never\nthought much about the price they receive. I'm sure\nit's relative to how much they bring in so I imagine\nit's fair.\nTony D 'Amato's perfect night in would appear to\nbe jamb a lay a, Billie Holiday on the stereo and\nBen-Hur on TV. What would be your perfect night\nin?\nThat is a creative question. It seems like I'm always\nfanta s ising on certain foods but it's not practical for\nme to eat them. There's a movie I like to see that\nplays a lot on the telly. McCabe and Mrs Miller is\nalways playing on the satellite TV I have. I'm a big\nJulie Christie fan and I always have been. As for\nmusic, it would be Frank Sinatra but I also like to\nlisten to arias.\nDo you feel that other ad or s are intimidated by\nyou?\nI don't feel that when I'm working with them. I just\ndo my work the same way I have always done. I couldn't possibly act if I felt that they had this feeling towards me because we all get in there and do\nit together. When I come to do a movie I feel I come\nwith thirty years of past and movies that I 've made\nso people have a tendency to respond to where\nthey know you. There's an image instilled in people\nof you. I have it when I meet someone that I know\njust through movies. Through the years, I 've learnt\nto let that go because they are never what you think\nthey are. In answer to the question, it's built in anyway and they soon get over it. We are like different\ninstruments in an orchestra and all the actors play\ntogether.\nWas Oliver Stone the director you have always\nwanted to work with?\nOliver directs as if he is in a state of chaos. He was\ndirecting four different scenes in the movie at the\nsame time. I was jaw dropped by that. He knows\nwhat he's doing and you feel that. You have confidence in some one who has a definitive vision of\nwhat they want.\nYour character Tony D 'Amato is afraid of the\nchanges as he gets older. Do you relate to that as\nyou approach sixty?\nMaybe I 've been spared as to me the whole idea of\nage is relative to the business you are in. I don't give\nit much thought, as it's all relative. Chronological\nage doesn't interest me.\nMaybe I'm kidding myself. There are certain\nacting parts that come up that you don't feel you\nwant to do as you've done them before. I'm not that\ninterested in playing roles I might have been interested in twenty years ago.\nHow have you and Oliver Stone changed over the\ntwenty years you've known each other?\nI don't think Oliver has changed at all. He's still as\nwild as ever and that's wonderful. He's the same\nguy I knew back then. Only he can tell you if I 've\nchanged. I hope I did a little. I don't feel as\nlabour ed about things any more. I believe in a healthy preparation for things.\nDo you think this film will appeal to people who\ndon't know anything about American football?\nI don't know. That's going to be interesting to see.\nI think they will get into the philosophy of it and the\nimpact it has on people's lives. So maybe that is\nrel a table. Every few years actors come and go but you've\nstayed; is there a formula to being an actor that\nlasts?\nMost actors go with the first role that anyone will\nhave you in. There's a point in a career where if you\ndo make it people want to use you just because\nyou've made it. You have to be careful when you\nchose a part, not to do it just because people want\nyou. If you weren't famous, they probably wouldn't take you for the part. Along the way, my choices for\nthings have changed. I made a little picture called\nChinese Coffee myself. I 've just finished putting it\ntogether. It only took four years. It's a small movie.\nI haven't acted in a year. I'm trying to find something I can connect to now.\nWhat has going behind the camera taught you\nabout acting?\nThere's a distinction between wanting to make a film and being a director. I flinch when I say director because I know what directors are and what\nthey do and I'm not one of them. I'm not in that\nleague. It's another talent. I look at things as an\nactor. I look at life and what I choose to do from an\nactor's point of view. For instance, this picture Chinese Coffee, I was acting in it and the director that\nI wanted wasn't there so I did it. It's almost impossible to direct yourself and act well in a movie you\ndirect. I can see the flaws in the film I made. If I was-n't in it, I think I could have done it better. The poor\nother actors in it I didn't direct them at all. After\neach take thirty people rush to this little monitor to\nsee the take and I just sit there and wait for their ver-dic t. They come back and say do it again. The film\nisn't bad. I'm a little embarrassed about directing as\nto me it's a different language.\n\n"

    "content": "18 Films Felix \u2022 2 May 2000\nII screen Sunshine\nAny film with Ralph Fiennes can be guaranteed not to be full of belly-laughing humour or infantile silliness. In fact, even a film with the title Sunshine, of course, because it stars Ralph Fiennes, will have nothing to do\nwith happiness or nice things but will be about doom, gloom and despair.\nThis film is an epic in terms of both length (three hours) and content, which\nwithout doubt is firmly on the serious side of serious.\nHowever, this does not mean it is a bad film and it is not by any stretch of\nthe imagination. It follows the trials and tribulations of the Sonnenschein\nfamily over one hundred and fifty years up to the present day. Set in director Istvan Szabo's native Hungary, we follow three generations of a Jewish\nfamily, as they struggle to keep themselves as one against a backdrop of\npolitical turmoil and two World Wars. The story begins with Emmanuel,\nwho using his inheritance of a recipe book for a liquor called 'Sunshine'\ntransforms his family from local peasant to wealthy businessman. His son,\nIgnatz builds on his father's respectability by becoming a high court judge.\nHowever, much to his families' horror, he is having a secret affair with his\n'sister', Valerie. However, she is actually his first cousin, but treated as his\nsibling after her father, Emmanuel's brother died. They have two sons, one\nof whom, Adam, becomes an Olympic fencer. He, himself has two children, cheats on his wife, before like most of them, succumbing to the horrors of the Holocaust. His only son to survive, Ivan scared by seeing his\nfather executed, seeks revenge by political motives in the Communist\nmovement. Before long the hypocrisy of the Communists dawns on him\nand so he campaigns for democracy, a realisation that after years of\nstruggle, finally happens.\nThe greatest twist in the film is not the intricacy of the plot, but the fact that\nRalph Fiennes plays Ignatz, Adam and Ivan during the film, reincarnating\nhimself as the son when his father dies. Each time he also sports a different kind of facial hair, a poor disguise I think you'll agree, that fails to masquerade the fact that it actually still is Ralph Fiennes. Apart from this stunt,\nhowever, the film is excellent in most respects. Fiennes is supported by a superb cast, especially Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris as the young\nand old Valerie. William Hurt makes an appearance, as does Rachel\nWeisz (last seen screaming incessantly at a computer generated mummy).\nTackling a difficult subject, this film depicts very well how, over one hundred and fifty years, Hungarians have been screwed (for want of a better\nword) by years of unsuccessful political naivety and experimentation. Will\nthis film attract the avid Imperial student, whose idea of a good time is\nalone in a dark room with a box of Kleenex and a DVD of The Matrix'? No,\nof course not. This film is extremely heavy going, which people will find\nrewarding only if they put in the effort to make it rewarding.\nErin Brockovich\nBased on a true story, Erin Brockovich is the latest film to star Julia Roberts\nof Notting Hill fame. Do not make the mistake of dismissing this as another movie where she plays a do ey eyed female who eventually falls in love\nwith the first attractive blok e she stumbles across. This is not that type of\nfilm.\nInstead, Julia Roberts plays Erin Brockovich, a single mother of three who\nhas led a hard life, knows it herself and doesn't mind letting other people\nknow it. One day, she is involved in a car accident in which she is badly\ninjured. Unfortunately, Ed Masry, the lawyer hired to present her case in\ncourt does not succeed and she is left in debt due to all the medical\nexpenses she incurred because of the accident. Determined to work, Erin\nhassles Ed Masry (Albert Finney) who failed her in court, to give her a job.\nHe does his best not to give in but eventually has no choice, as Erin is one\ndetermined bitch. Whilst in his employment she stumbles across some files\nthat don't make sense to her and convinces Ed into letting her investigate\nthem. This she does extremely well and unearths a conspiracy. The rest of\nthe story is about how Erin and Ed deal with the conspiracy .\nAlthough not a romantic comedy, this film could be classed as one. It has\nall the makings of a romance but without all that slushy stuff that makes\nguys go 'ur g hl' and it is also extremely amusing at times. The funniest bits\nare the references by Erin to her breasts, especially when she is trying to\nget herself heard by people who wouldn't normally listen to some-one like\nher. This she does quite a lot and has the desired effect. Apparently the\nenhanced cleavage is all down to a special gel padded bra not a boob\njob, but I'm not convinced.\nThe director, Steven Soderbergh, allows his classic trademarks to shine\nthrough in this work. Soderbergh casts an excellent leading pair in Julia\nRoberts and Ed Finney just as he did with Jennifer Lopez and George\nClooney in Out of Sight. Admittedly, there is no sexual chemistry between\nthe pair as Finney's character is old enough to easily be Roberts father, but\nthey do share a screen chemistry that works like a dream. Making a cameo is the real Erin Brockovich as a waitress in a restaurant that the\ncharacter Erin takes her children to for a treat. Try not to blink at that point\nor you will miss her. Soderbergh's cinematography is similar to that of his\nprevious movies and that too works well without distracting from the sto-ry line. If you are a fan of Julia Roberts (or just interested in her new blossoming\ncleavage) this film is a must see. It has so much feel good factor and just\ngoes to show that you can do absolutely anything you want if you want it\nenough.\nDrew Helen\n\n"

Although\nthe decision was primarily made on\ngrounds of cost - a total loss in\nexcess of \u00a310 000 was projected for\na return to last year's venue - ICU\nDeputy President (Finance and Services) Ian Clifford suggested that a move to the Fulham venue also\nbrings with it several other advantages, such as proximity and a lower\nticket price. Union President Tasha\nNewton confirmed this buoyant out-look, promising that this year's event\nwill be \"really super du per\". Although a date of Saturday 24\nJune was tentatively agreed before\nChristmas, several changes of plan -caused by the need for adequate\nLast year's Summer Ball at the Alexandra Palace Photo: Jonas\ntime to set-up the planned Ents,\nincluding a band, disco and casino -have eventually led to Friday 23\nJune, one week before the end of\nterm, being chosen. Tickets will cost\n\u00a345 and should go on sale on Monday 15 May. A three course meal,\nchampagne reception, assorted\nentertainments and \"lots and lots of\nwine\" will all be included in the price.\nAfter last year's massive losses,\none of the major concerns for Mr\nClifford is ensuring that the event\ncannot possibly lose money, so the\nscale of the Ball has been considerably reduced. Around 450 - 5 0 0\ntickets will need to be sold in order\nfor the event to break even. However, the hotel's owners have set a limit\nof 850 people on their \"Enterprise\nSuite\", which means that, at full\ncapacity, around 500 fewer revellers\nthan last year will be able to attend.\nIn order to make sure that the\nevent runs as smoothly as possible in\nfuture years, the current sabbatical\nteam has already begun planning for\nthe 2001 Summer Ball, which is likely to take place on Queen's Lawn. As\na result, Ms Newton was keen to\npoint out that this year's dinner will\nbe \"the last to be held outside of the\nCollege for some time... so I guess\nit's really the year to go\". Although\nthere are fears that much of the fun\nof the event will be lost by a move\nonto campus, Mr Clifford pointed\nout several clear advantages to basing the Ball at South Kensington. In\nparticular, the event would be much\ncheaper to run (as there would be no\ncharge for venue hire ), meaning that\nticket prices will be decreased and\nEnts will be drastically improved -indeed, this year's Summer Ball\nwould almost certainly have taken\nplace on site had it not been for the\nongoing building work.\nAnyone who wants to be\ninvolved in next year's Ball should\ncontact Tasha Newton via pre si dent@ic.ac.uk.\ncone Make yourself heard\nImperial College Union Council6.00 pm, Tuesday 2nd May\nCU Council+ ICU Council ItCJlWi! + iCD.

I 've often thought\nof just booking into a hotel to collapse in my drunken stupor, but with\nthe prices as high as they are\naround South Ken, I 've never been\nable to afford even the smallest sin-g le.

I'd heard of the hotel before, having\nrecently read an article in the Telegraph on the standard of the food,\ninterviewing the head chef Andy\nsomething, about his work; this was\nall the ammo I needed.\nTo bo a good bla gg cr it is\nessentials that you are a master of\nthe three C's: Coolness, Conviction\nand Confidence. When lying you\nalso must ensure that the web of\ndeceit that you are spinning can not\nbe traced or checked. Although I have blatantly lied to people before\nfor the sake of ab lag, this was the\nfirst time I have ever tried to convince someone face to face, knowing that there are huge odds\nstacked against them believing me\nand that they could find out the\ntruth, within minutes, if they were\nsceptical.\nAfter iast orders, having\nempowered myself with a little '\nDutch courage, I walked into the\nHotel, slightly dishevelled, with the\nlook of an embarrassed lame dog.\nUnfortunately my flat mate had disappeared with my keys (most likely\nto his girlfriend's house miles away)\nand as a consequence I was locked\nout of my flat. Given that I worked in\nthe hotel's kitchens as a pot washer,\nI was hoping thot the hotel would\nput me up for the night in one of\ntheir spare rooms, as my only other\nalternative was to sleep rough, after\nall the hotel is like a family. They\nthen asked for my name and they\nsaid they'd never heard of me, so I explained that I'd only been working\nfor a few weeks as a favour to Andy\nthe head chef; feasible.\nThis is the point at which I could\nhave been bugger ed, but because\nof the time, everyone had finished in\nthe kitchens and the office y type\npeople had long gone home locking up al! of the employer details, or\nso I assume. I was then asked to\nwait so they could check on their\ndatabase to see which rooms were\nvacant and I had my doubts for a while, in spite of my Oscar-winning\nperformance. They came to nothing\nthough and I was handed my key to\none of their rooms, out the door\nsecond on the right. Jackpot, it-was\na double, stuffed full of booze, jelly\nbeans and dried almonds, but I felt\nfar too guilty to help myself and if I was caught, the cost of the mini bar could tip the balance between a laugh and a felony in the manager's eyes.\nThe only downside to this b lag is that unlike other b lags, the b lag ger has to leave himself vulnerable\nfor a prolonged period of time,\nsleeping with the evidence. Paranoid, but content with what I had\nachieved I woke at 7.30, leaving in\nthe most discreet manner possible,\nto stay any later would be taking the\npiss and would run the risk of the\nmanager figuring out what had:\nhappened.\nIf you have any challenges or\nhave any b lags that you're proud of,\nthat you want to see appearing in\nthis column, drop me an email at\nthe bl agger s guide@ hotmail.com.\n\n"

    "content": "2 May 2000 \u00ab Felix Books25 Hero in the Shadows\nDavid Gemmell\nThis is the first David Gemmell book I have read and it certainly makes me\nwish I'd picked one up much earlier, as this is easily the best book I have read\nin ages. In fact, this is the third book to contain GemmeH's Waylander character - but fear not if you, like me, have not read the other two, as this is a complete story within itself (somewhat novel in the fantasy genre that tends\nto specialise in epics). There are references to previous books, but they are\nsmoothly explained and don't leave you with that irritating feeling that you're\nmissing out on something important.\nFrom the first paragraph you are plunged into the action of a savage village\nraid and things just never stop from there on. Even if you are someone who\nonly reads occasionally, I defy you to be able to put this book down and not\nbe itching to get back to it. Perhaps not such a good thing before exams,\nbut definitely a good aid to relaxation afterwards.\nTo fill you in a bit on the plot: Waylander, the retired prince of assassins, must\ndo battle against cruel sorcerers and their demonic minions to prevent his\nworld being over run by an ancient evil. To his aid come friends both old and\nnew - Kysumu, a 'Rajnee' swordsman of a dying order; Yu Yu Liang, a simple ditch-digger with dreams of fame and heroism; Usarte, a powerful half-breed priestess and Keeva Taliana, a peasant girl with uncanny weapon\nskills. Together they must wake the dead Rjor-nor warriors to restore the waning magic of the portal that holds the terror of Huan Kador out of their\nrealm. But dissent has already been sown amongst the avaricious local\nnobility, is there a traitor in their midst?\nThe plot is excellent, neatly drawing all the storylines together at the end. The\nonly fault lies in perhaps relying a little too much on chance. His characters,\nhowever, more than make up for this as they are all rounded and believable.\nGemmell allows them to deal with real human difficulties in a way that shows\ngenuine understanding. Waylander, feared and hated by many for his fabulous wealth and direct manner, must come to terms with his own hidden\ncharacter and actions past and present.\nSomewhat surprisingly, Gemmeli's first attempt at fiction writing was met with\nunusual scorn from'one agent. He was advised to continue working as a lorry driver's mate for Pepsi Cola as it was 'a career not without merit'. However, twenty-one books and over one million sales later David Gemmell has\nbeen praised from all quarters as one of fantasy's greatest writers.\nKatherine\nbooks= Helen's Literary\nEvents in and\naround London\nMONDAY1 ST NEW RIVER WRITERS Friendly workshop based group.
