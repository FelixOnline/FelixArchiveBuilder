No photo of\nthe week meant I had to find a different,\nself-containing theme or idea for this\narticle.\nI had a hard time. I spoke to friends\nand Felix colleagues, as well as other\nphotographers, to try and motivate\nmyself to write something deeply\nmoving, profoundly inspiring, and\naltogether a great read.\nNow, staring at a blank page, I think of\nmy friend Jonah\u2019s own words: \u201cThey can\u2019t\nall be winners\u201d.\nTruer words were never spoken, and\nthey ring loud and clear in my mind as I\nscroll through my Babylonian archive of\npictures. Our photos also can\u2019t all be win-ners. There\u2019s a common misconception\nthat photography is an ever-improving\nskill. Peter McKinnon, photographer and\nYouTuber, talks about the \u201conly bangers\u201d myth, and how taking and sharing\npictures shouldn\u2019t be focused on always\nproducing the best result but more on\ncreating for its own sake.\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m also a victim and\nperpetrator of creative perfectionism; I\ntake loads of pictures and rarely post or\npublish a single one. Scared of producing something worse than my previous\ncreative endeavours, I end up in a\nrut, never living up to my own insane\nexpectations, and unable to accept that\nI haven\u2019t dramatically improved my\nphotography over a couple of weeks.\nThe year\u2019s just started, and while I\ndon\u2019t believe in New Year\u2019s resolutions, I\ndo believe in just starting to do things, if\none wants to. In light of this, I offer some\nadvice. To myself: publish what you like\nand don\u2019t think twice about it. To you, the\nreader: take a few more pictures than you\ndid last year, or edit those ones from a\ncouple of years ago that you are still\nscared to have a look at. Who knows,\nmaybe at the end of this year we\u2019ll both\nlook back and be content purely with the\nfact that we practised our hobby, far removed from our vicious self-judgement.\nBut, at the end of it all, this is still the\nphotography section, and the comments\nhave already been taken care of, so I\u2019ll\nleave you with a picture that summarises\nhow I feel this cold January. It\u2019s up to you\nto decide whether you like it or not, but\nif you do, I recommend checking out all\nof Sabine Weiss\u2019 body of work, a French\nhumanist photographer who died only\nrecently in 2021.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n22 | Food&Travel 19 January 2024\nT\nhis true hidden gem for game fanatics has been on\nmy list for quite some time, but it requires a certain\nlevel of enthusiasm. Chess, Guess Who, Monopoly, and Cluedo are just some of the many board games\noffered, with at least 200 others available, along with\na fantastic waiter who can explain them all to you \u2013 a\ngame connoisseur, I called him. Draughts, my dear read-er, is a restaurant-bar-pub open for all types of evenings:\na date, a game night with family or friends, or just a simple way to determine the smartest player in your group.\nNonetheless, it holds more than just games and good\nfood, with kind staff who do not hide their excellent\nteamwork, and laughter which jumps from one table to\nthe next.\nThe staff\nOne of the waitresses saw me stare at the wall of games\nin front of me and asked, \u201cAre you looking for anything\nspecific?\u201d to which I replied, \u201cSomething competitive,\ncan you recommend anything?\u201d Afterwards, she sent\nthe game-master, the one with ultimate knowledge, to\nour table to give us some suggestions. Roughly my age,\nshe was incredibly welcoming, as were her colleagues \u2013\na rare sight in London. The waiting team was abundant,\nleaving no worker feeling overburdened and stressed\non this random Tuesday night. As the night ended at\n22:30 and we were kicked out, we laughed a little with\nthe staff and wished them farewell, discussing between\nourselves that we will return soon.\nThe vegan nachos\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem as if they have many vegan options,\u201d\nmy friend proceeds to state. \u201cOh, they have more than\nthe usual restaurant,\u201d I replied quickly. We proceeded\nto share the large vegan nachos and the mushroom ta-cos, which sadly turned cold while we were immersed\nin our game. The nachos were crispy, with a small topping of mildly hot sour salsa and a light sprinkle of coconut cheese, all with creamy guacamole. The \u2018queso\u2019\ndip did its best, but its texture did not complement the\ncrunchy tortilla chips well. Vegan cheeses are still underdeveloped and are often still inferior to dairy chees-es. I would have left it out completely and added more\nsalsa, or perhaps avocado. On the other hand, the\ntacos included a generous amount of well marinated and fried mushrooms, with beans and red cabbage forming the base of the tortilla. At last, the\nSauvignon blanc was rather sweet and fruity, a\nreal treat for the evening. The beauty of the restaurant is that the games and the food offer a perfect way to spend hours at the establishment. While\nmain dishes are in the price range of \u00a315\u201320 and\nstarters are priced between \u00a38\u201312, the starter and\nthe main were filling enough for two people,\naveraging the price to \u00a315 per person without\ndrinks.\nReservations\nThe reservation does require a \u00a315 appearance fee which\nI happily paid as I soon noticed that the place was in\nhigh demand. Considering that guests typically stay for\nmany hours, reservations make a lot of sense. I reserved\nfor five hours, 7pm to midnight, but surprisingly they\nclosed at 22:30. The staff was kind enough to warn us\nwhen the kitchen closed at 21:30, the bar closed at 22:00,\nand so did the restaurant half an hour later; however, no\none was kicked out aggressively, rather just notified.\nCompetition, huh?\nHaving taken advantage of the games available, we\nspent the last hour playing two games: Rummy, my favourite card game, and Speed Scrabble, a game designed\nby ourselves. The Scrabble board was large, wooden and\ncarved, almost as if we had found old treasure. The tile\nholders were metal, painted in gold, and the tiles did not\neven have points on them \u2013 we had to use the board for\nreference. We played words such as \u2018wee\u2019, \u2018yee\u2019 and \u2018xi\u2019,\nwhich are technically legal and show the complexity\nand uniqueness of the game. Apparently, in competitive\nScrabble, players may play illegal words as long as their\nopponent does not challenge them. I won the second\nround purely on this basis as my friend lost ten points\nfor playing some word I no longer remember. I fear\neveryone heard me cheer as I won the game 46:39.\nWill I return?\nAbsolutely. You are allowed to bring your own games, as\nthey do not charge you for any games to rent, hence it\nmakes no difference to them. The warm colours of the\ninterior reminded me of kindergarden. People of all\nages played many kinds of games, from those involving\ncomplex strategies such as Dungeons and Dragons, to\nsimpler ones such as UNO or Guess Who; they enjoyed\nthemselves all the way into the night. It was one of my\nfavourite experiences in London.\nUntil next time,\nCharlotte\nLet\u2019s play a game, shall we?\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nFood&TravelEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nWaterloo is home to Draughts \u2013 a warm place filled\nwith board games and vegan nachos.

    "content": "B\nlack hole opens in the kitchen,\u201d\nsings Julien Baker to a swelling electric guitar. \u201cEvery clock\u2019s a different\ntime.\u201d So begins the sixth track on Boygenius\u2019s recent album, a twelve-song cycle unhelpfully titled the record. I can\u2019t\nsay with certainty that this is the first reference to gravitational time dilation to\nchart at #1 in the UK (for one thing, Imperial\u2019s own Brian May might have slipped\nsuch allusions into any number of Queen\nsongs) but it probably is. And with this\nband at the wheel, it may not be last.\nBoygenius is an indie rock supergroup,\nformed in 2018 by the singer-songwriters\nJulien Baker, Lucy Dacus, and Phoebe\nBridgers. In early 2023, they released\ntheir first full-length album to universal acclaim, going on to play\na 25,000-person gig in\nLondon last August.\nBoygenius style\nthemselves as an all-queer, all-female\nboy band, noted for their complex and\nemotional songwriting and two-piece\ngrey suits. They are\nalso noted, though\nmaybe only by me, for\ntheir increasing obsession with\nastronomy.\nThis isn\u2019t\nentirely new\nterritory for\nthe band. Bridgers, especially, has\nforyearsbeenwritingsongsabout\nfull moons, foreign satellites, and\nplanetary alignments. Her 2020\nalbum closer, \u2018I Know The End\u2019, describes\nher apocalyptic thoughts upon seeing\na bolt of lightning hanging frozen over\nthe California coast \u2013 which later turned\nout to be the white smoke-trail of a nearby SpaceX launch. Still, this new artistic\nforay into general relativity is an impressive step into some fairly mind-boggling\nphysics. In an interview with Emma Carey, Dacus said, \u201cThe benevolence of the\nblack hole is just like, cope how you must\non our journey into the dark. Also, on a\npersonal level, everybody dies.\u201d Cheery\nstuff.\nThis trend has only continued. In October they released the rest, a companion\nEP to therecord. The\nsubject of\nt h e\nfirst song is another black hole, this time\na particular specimen: \u201cYou can see the\nstars the ones/The headlines said this\nmorning/Were bein\u2019 spat out by something we thought/Was just destroyin\u2019\neverything for good.\u201d This refers to a paper that made headlines in April where\na group of astronomers discovered what\nseemed to be a black hole ejected from its\nhost galaxy, trailed by a path of anomalous blue stars. It is thought that the passage of such a massive object had so disturbed the clouds of intergalactic gas as to\nkickstart the process of stellar formation\nin its wake, creating a glowing arc across\nspace. And the physics hardly stops there.\n\u2018Powers\u2019, the last song on the EP, manages\nto cram in two mentions of nuclear fission\nand one each of orbital mechanics and su-percollider-induced particle production.\nGenuinely.\nSo, whast\u2019s behind this supernova of\nphysics metaphors? Is pop music, contrary to widespread belief, actually getting more intelligent? In five years will\nwe see albums about baryon asymmetry\nand p-nuclei topping the charts? Well,\nprobably not. The truth is that since\nstreaming became mainstream, pop has\nbeen fractur- ing. Most people\nnow have at\nleast a couple of obscure bands that they\nunabashedly adore, so the already vague\ncategory of \u2018Popular Music\u2019 is becoming\nincreasingly infiltrated by alternative\ngenres.\nIn this case, the Boygenius members\nall have roots and branches in a rumina-tive form of folk-rock that has become\nmore established in the last couple of\ndecades. A big feature of much of this\nmusic is the use of imagery that the artist\nfinds funny or interesting, even if nobody\nelse knows what the hell they\u2019re talking\nabout. John Darnielle, a mainstay of this\nscene and one of Baker\u2019s long-time fa-vourites, wrote a song in 2015 about a\nprofessional wrestler being stabbed to\ndeath. That\u2019s niche enough for anyone,\nsurely, but whatever intersection there\nis between WWE fans and stellar physicists will have been thrilled by the song\u2019s\nclimax. \u201cThe sky goes dark,\u201d Darnielle in-tones. \u201cAnd there I am \u2013 climbing down\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.\u201d\nThat H-R Diagram shows the main\nsequence of star types, arranged by temperature and luminosity. To descend\ndown this chart into cold dim oblivion\nis the fate of all low-mass suns, including our own. In their own lifetimes as stars, however, it seems\nthat Boygenius are still on the\nrise. May they continue to\npeddle their bizarre as-tro-analogies for as\nlong as the planet\nkeeps spinning.\nMusicWriter\nDANIEL HESK\nAll-Girl\nAstrophysics\nin the Music of\nBoygenius\nIllustration:\nJennie Chongbang\nfor Felix\n\n"

The latest IMBIE assessment, published on 20th\nApril 2023, estimated the rate of Greenland\u2019s ice loss\nto be more than five times faster in 2020 than it was in\n1992, when records first began. This increased rate of\nice loss, driven by global warming, is leading to sea-lev-el rise that will cause devastating flooding around the\nworld. Ice loss leads to fewer bright surfaces off of which\nsunlight can be reflected, which has the knock-on effect\nof accelerating the greenhouse effect and amplifying\nglobal warming. Losing large stretches of glaciers also\nmeans habitat loss for polar bears and other Arctic wild-life.\nIn efforts to slow the ice melt, a number of innovative\ngeo-engineering projects for \u2018refreezing\u2019 Greenland and\nother neighbouring glaciers have been proposed.\nMarine cloud brightening (MCB) is one of these\npromising technologies, outlined by teams of researchers at the University of Cambridge, UK, and Delft University, the Netherlands. MCB draws on the physics of\ncloud formation; that higher concentrations of nucleat-ing particles tend to create clouds with a higher albedo,\nwhich would reflect more sunlight away from the at-mosphere. To achieve this the researchers, supported by\nthe Refreeze the Arctic Foundation, suggest artificially\ndispersing seawater through the atmosphere to make\nclouds denser and brighter.\nAlong similar lines is stratospheric aerosol injection,\na method described in a 2022 paper by Wake Smith, a\nclimate researcher at Yale University, USA, and his\ncolleagues. High-altitude jets would spray aerosols at\nroughly 43,000 feet. These aerosols would drift upwards\nand create an artificial atmospheric layer to deflect the\nSun\u2019s rays. The study concludes that, although this is a\nfeasible option for helping refreeze glacial ice, further\nresearch is necessary to confirm that the aerosols in\nquestion wouldn\u2019t pose a threat to Earth\u2019s ecosystems.\nAdditionally, it will take time to convince policymakers\nto accept and allow this technique to be implemented.\nFinally, a study published in March 2023 investigates\nthe feasibility of implementing seabed-anchored cur-tains, with a focus on identifying the optimal conditions\nand design for this technology. These curtains would sit\nattached to the sea floor to block the flow of warm water\nin lower down channels, aiming to slow the melting of\nglaciers while still allowing movement of icebergs and\nnutrient-rich waters in the upper levels of the sea. The\nresearchers have proposed trials in Greenland to further\ntest the technology. While a technology for glacier preservation rather than a method of refreezing them, sea-bed-anchored curtains could prove useful for slowing\nthe melting of the larger West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\nThese novel technologies will take time to gain traction and funding, so further studies are needed to test\ntheir viability and improve their public and political\nreception. If refreezing of glaciers and ice sheets in the\nArctic and Antarctic can be achieved, this could slow\nthe effects of global warming and buy us more time to\nwork on conservation, climate-change mitigation, and\necosystem restoration. Innovative solutions like those\ndescribed here are especially important given recent\nnews that scientists might have severely underestimated \u2013 by as much as 20% \u2013 the amount of ice lost from the\nGreenland ice sheet since 1985.\nia\nRefreezing polar ice: feasible or fantasy?\nA\nrctic Ice is a start-up that exports glacial ice from\nGreenland to cocktail bars in the United Arab\nEmirates. Co-founder Malik V Rasmussen says\nthat he was looking to expand the scope of Greenland\u2019s\nexports by commodifying the country\u2019s supply of glacier ice. This polar ice is said to take longer to melt owing to its lack of aeration and is free of the contaminants\npresent in regular mineral-water ice.\nThe company claims that, by harvesting ice that has\nalready broken off glaciers and larger icebergs, it creates\nminimal environmental impact. However, these small\nice floes are as vital to the Arctic ecosystem as large glaciers are, providing crucial resting and birthing spots\nfor large mammals such as polar bears, walruses, and\nseals. Rasmussen also claims that Arctic Ice is \u2018committed to becoming carbon neutral\u2019, but it is yet to be seen\nwhether it will achieve this. The response to this news\nhas been one of confusion, outrage, and even amusement at the ludicracy of the venture.\nT\nhe verdict of a 15-year legal dispute between the private mining company Nordic Mining and two Norway-based environmental organisations \u2013 Friends\nof the Earth and Nature & Youth \u2013 was decided last\nweek. Nordic Mining has been awarded a licence to discard its waste products in an area spanning 4% of Norway\u2019s F\u00f8rde fjord. Although this permission was granted\nin 2015, Friends of the Earth and Nature & Youth, along\nwith several other environmental groups, submitted\ncomplaints to oppose the project in the years following,\nwhich has restricted the operations until now.\nNordic Mining mines primarily garnet, rutile (titani-um oxide), quartz (silicon oxide), and lithium, extracting valuable minerals and metals that are some of the\ncountry\u2019s most unique exports. This might somewhat\nexplain the government\u2019s willingness to support the\nindustry, despite the disposed waste products posing a\nsevere risk to the marine wildlife \u2013 cod and salmon in\nparticular \u2013 that call the fjord home.\nThe Norwegian Institute of Marine Research advised\nagainst using the fjord for waste disposal on the grounds\nthat it would \u201cjeopardise a healthy, sustainable ecosystem\u201d. Local businesses, fishing and tourism organisa-tions, environmental bodies in the Norwegian govern-ment, and citizens have all expressed discontent at the\nproject\u2019s approval, which makes it all the more surprising that it was finally given the go-ahead. Although this\nis a devastating outcome for environmental legislation\ngiven the time and money that was spent on campaigning and court cases, financial support for environmental\nlaw firms and NGOs goes a long way to ensuring they\ncan continue their work on these kinds of cases.\nWaste-dumping licences granted\nto Nordic mining company\nStart-up sells Arctic ice\nto Dubai cocktail bars\n\n"

Their discography, which blends alternative\nR&B, synth-pop, and dance-friendly sensibilities, was\non heavy rotation throughout the winter of my second\nyear in university. The two, who met as students at the\nUniversity of Toronto and produced their first tracks in\ntheir dorm, have retained the same musical curiosity\nthroughout the past decade, effortlessly switching from\nsynth-wave tracks like \u2018Summer Rain\u2019 to stripped-back\nacoustic confessionals such as \u2018Forget About The Party\u2019. This time around, the pair are back with a soulful,\nsonically cohesive album entitled Good People, a nod to\nthe original pseudonym they released their first SoundCloud collaboration under.\nThis album forgoes the dynamic track shifts of its\n2021 predecessor Wildest Dreams, instead opting for a\nmellow, simmering experience akin to watching a gradual sunset in solitude. The colours of one\nsong melt seamlessly into the next. Some\nmay call it inconsequential or underwhelm-ing, but I consider the simplicity of production its virtue. This album might not be your\nfirst choice for handling the aux at your next\nfunction, but it\u2019s great for 3am sentimentali-ty. Majid Jordan offers a new iteration to their\nsound journey with a more sophisticated,\nrestrained palate. Beats are minimal, Majid\u2019s\nvocals are centerstage, and the atmosphere is\nwarm.\nThe opener \u2018Tears In Your Eyes\u2019 features\ngentle guitar and vocal layers in the background substituting chords as Majid croons\nabout his need for a lover in his life. Warbling\nkeys add an extra shimmer to the track. The\nsong leads with his winding vocal lines that\ndefy the austerity of its supporting produc-tion, making way for the entry of a smooth\nbass line, conga beat and rustling shakers.\nThese earthy sounds and the repeating lyrics coalesce,\ncreating a lulling ambience to the track and a definitive\nintroduction to the creative direction of subsequent\ntracks.\nListeners will catch traces of a Michael Jackson influence on the track \u2018Eyes Closed\u2019; to my surprise, sounds\nreminiscent of The xx on the song \u2018Hands Tied\u2019 which\nthey interestingly chose as one of the three pre-released\nsingles. My personal standouts from this album were\n\u2018Violet\u2019 and \u2018The Message\u2019. The former is a seven minute\nebb and flow between radio-filtered verses, and buzzing,\nalmost psychedelic vocals in the chorus. All of this takes\nplace over a relaxed drumbeat, synths, and a looping\nelectric guitar which immediately conjures up the image of a leisure cruise at sundown.\nThe album would not be complete without a tender,\nguitar-backed declaration of love found in \u2018The Message\u2019. This is like the older, more mature cousin to \u2018Forget About The Party\u2019. \u2018Cyanide\u2019 is the perfect second\npunch in the tail end of the album with its affectionate,\nfalsetto delivery of the line: \u201cYou take my shy away\u201d. The\nalbum ends on a pensive note, with the ambient, sparse\naural expanse of the track \u2018Sunset\u2019. Good People tells us\nthat good music need not be complicated. Majid Jordan\nshow off immense feelings with sincerity and soul while\nkeeping the production\u2019s moderation in mind. Brian\nHamilton, one of the duo\u2019s background vocalists, explained that this new layout with the violins facing each\nother, rather than being in their usual close proximity,\nwas something that they had never done before. The effect of having a mirror image violin proved particularly\neffective in a section in one of the songs in which the\ntwo violins performed a heated virtuosic duet!\nI am excited to see what the band comes up with next,\nespecially with this new direction which seems to involve electronically-manipulated vocals sung by Magdalena McLean, reminiscent of Caroline Polacheck\u2019s\nheavily stylised singing or Georgia Ellery\u2019s extensively\nprocessed vocal manipulations in her London-based\nduo with Taylor Skye, Jockstrap. Keep your eyes and ears\npeeled for new single releases and concert performances from this relatively new and exciting eight-piece\nband caroline!\nCanadian R&B duo, Majid Jordan,\ndelivers an easy, understated listen and a\nmasterclass on moderation\nGood People\nIs Good Music\nMusicWriter\nSELINA YE\nMUSIC\nCover of Majid Jordan\u2019s album, Good People, released on 17 November, 2023.\nSoundCloud \u00a9\n\n"

Using\nentirely biodegradable materials, several trees are tied\ntogether in bunches then dropped into local bodies of\nwater such as Lake M\u00e4laren, where they sink to the bot-tom, weighted down with bags of stones. There, these\npine trees sink and become makeshift reefs, providing\nspawning grounds and shelter for aquatic life \u2013 particularly salmon and trout, which are popular among local\nanglers.\nLake M\u00e4laren and other rivers in Sweden have been\ndamaged by the dredging needed to allow large cargo\nand cruise ships to pass through. This creative solution\nfor habitat restoration gives a second life to the numerous Christmas trees that would otherwise end up in\nlandfills or be incinerated.\nStudents might have seen the many Christmas-tree\ngraveyards littering the streets of London in the past few\nweeks; perhaps these could be revitalised in the same\nway as the Swedish trees are, finding a new home on the\nThames riverbed. However, citizens mustn\u2019t go around\ndumping their trees in their nearest body of water. The\nprocess is a controlled one, carefully executed with\noversight from the city council and the help of experts\nfrom WWF and the Swedish Anglers Association.\nStockholm dumps Christmas\ntrees into rivers to create homes for fish\nO\nn Tuesday 9th January, the Norwegian government voted in a bill that approves deep-sea mining\n(DSM) activities in the open Arctic waters near to\nthe country. This makes them the first country in the\nworld to allow the commercialisation of this practice in\ndomestic waters, despite warnings about its likely impact on the exploited marine areas.\nDSM is the harvesting of metal ores from the deep\nseabed to extract useful metals. The three main types of\nore being targeted are polymetallic nodules, polymetal-lic sulphides, and cobalt crusts. These mineral deposits\nhave formed over thousands of years, storing metals\nsuch as manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, nickel, gold,\nand silver.\nIt has long been known that the deepest, most-un-touched parts of the ocean contain these rare earth and\npreciousmetals,butinterestinDSMhasonlyrecentlyre-surfaced owing to demand for technologies that require\nthese materials. Because many of these technologies,\nsuch as renewable-energy generation and lithium-ion\nbatteries for electric vehicles, will aid the transition towards net-zero, this makes it easier for companies to justify any environmental damage caused by the practice.\nThe Norwegian government claims that it will implement this bill gradually while remaining conscientious\nof relevant environmental research, but a lot of study\nstill needs to be done on the environmental impacts of\nDSM.\nIt is thought that the sweeping of the seabed necessary for DSM would kill many of the creatures inhabiting areas such as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a\nregion of high scientific and economic interest in the\nPacific Ocean, where more than 5,000 species were\nnewly identified last year. DSM would disrupt the delicate balance of these ecosystems, directly affecting the\nfeeding and reproductive patterns of organisms in the\nmined areas. Mining machinery would also cause severe noise and light pollution, as well as create sediment\nclouds, which would have further-reaching effects on\nmarine life that could be detrimental to nearby fishing\ncommunities in the long term.\nNorway\u2019s decision exposes its blatant irreverence for\nEarth\u2019s resources. Expecting to exhaust supplies of rare\nearth metals in the near future, firms are looking for\nthem in the few parts of the planet left unexploited. It\u2019s\na sad commentary on the state of today\u2019s policymaking\nthat, instead of more heavily regulating the use of existing processed materials, governments are instead approving further exploitative activity. Some studies have\nshown that expanding existing mining activities on\nland has less environmental impact than initiating new\nDSM practices. Governments should incentivise the recycling of electronic devices and more-efficient use of\nthe refined rare earth metals that they already possess\nto reduce demand for mining.\nThough somewhat protected by the jurisdiction of\nthe International Seabed Authority, this interest and\napproval of commercial mining activities in the deep\noceans could become more widespread in the coming\nyears. Oceans contain many of Earth\u2019s most precious\necosystems, being home to one of our primary food\nsources, and being the planet\u2019s largest natural carbon\nsink. Surely we should be focusing on finding ways to\nbetter preserve and protect this vital resource instead of\nexploiting it?\nNorway passes harrowing deep sea mining bill\n\n"

It describes a simple hypothesis which would\ntake the field of mathematics over 100 years to finally\nprove. The theorem states: every map on a plane can be\ncoloured using four colours such that two regions that\nshare an edge cannot be the same colour. This is now\nknown as the \u2018four-colour theorem\u2019.\nOrigins: colouring in the counties of\nEngland\nThe theorem was inspired by a man who tried to colour\nin the counties of England, and believed he had done it\nin just four colours. He discussed this with his brother,\nwho mentioned it to his lecturer, Augustus De Morgan,\nwho then shared it further afield. The problem caught\nthe eye of many mathematicians, and, although it is\neasy to describe, it turns out that the proof is surprisingly challenging. Even when a solution was finally published in 1976, it turned out to be a rather unsatisfying\none, as it couldn\u2019t easily be checked by other mathematicians and instead relied on a computer program to ensure its validity.\nIn 1879, Alfred Kempe attempted a proof by contra-diction, which he started with the assumption that the\nfour-colour theorem is false. This technique can also be\nused to prove the six-colour theorem, whereby one assumes that a map can\u2019t be coloured using six colours and\nend up at a contradiction. Kempe published this proof\nand mathematicians accepted it, until ten years later,\nwhen Percy Heawood showed that Kempe\u2019s proof was\nfalse. Although Heawood couldn\u2019t prove the four-colour\ntheorem himself, he managed to prove the five-colour\ntheorem, and shifted the focus of the proof not to the\nregions themselves, but to the borders between them.\nThrough this shift, in 1898, he was able to show that if\nthe number of edges around each region is divisible by\nthree, then the four-colour theorem holds.\nGraph theory\nLater, the theorem was made more abstract by drawing\neach map into a graph, a 2D diagram made up of dots\n(known as nodes) and lines connecting them (known\nas edges). For the purpose of this problem, each node\nrepresented a region of the map that needed colouring\nin, while an edge connecting two dots meant the two regions had a common edge. Throughout the 20th\ncentu-ry, mathematicians tried to reduce the graphs of maps\ndown to special cases in order to simplify the problem.\nEventually, in 1976, it took two mathematicians at the\nUniversity of Illinois \u2013 Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang\nHaken \u2013 to solve the problem. Reducing the number of\nmaps to 1936 different configurations, they wrote an\nalgorithm that worked in a similar fashion to Kempe\u2019s\nproof, and checked each case using a computer. This\nalgorithm showed that none of the configurations required five colours, thereby proving the four-colour\ntheorem. Following this, the number of configurations\nthat needed checking continued to be reduced, and by\n1996, the number of cases needing to be checked had\nbeen reduced down to 633. The algorithm used to check\neach case also improved significantly, and an alternative\nproof was announced in 2001, but was never published.\nUnconventional methods\nThe four-colour theorem was one of the first significant\nmathematical theories to be proven using computer as-sistance. Hence, at the time it was not widely accepted,\ndespite the proof being valid, and without flaws. However, many considered it to be inelegant because it was\nsimply checking cases and didn\u2019t provide a fundamental\nunderstanding as to why the theorem is true. One example of this is the Pythagorean theorem, which was\nproven simply by checking the angles of each possible\nright-angled triangle. Without this we wouldn\u2019t understand why right-angled triangles behave the way they\ndo.\nMathematicians wanted to find a fundamental reason why the four-colour theorem was true, and the com-puter-assisted proof simply failed to provide this kind of\nexplanation.\nWhile many didn\u2019t like that the proof relied on a computer checking cases, traditional proofs all turned out\nto be faulty or flawed in one way or another. Hence, as\ntime went on, people began to accept this proof, as well\nas computer-assisted proofs in general. In many ways,\nthe proof of the four-colour theorem opened mathematics up to new methods and opportunities. Although\ncomputer proofs continue to make some mathematicians uncomfortable, it has nonetheless become a wide-ly-used tool, and allows mathematics to advance alongside computer science and computer programming.\nFrom maps to mathematics:\nthe Four-Colour theorem\nSCIENCE\nScienceWriter\nJOHN ZOU\nDelving into the\norigins of the first\nmajor computer\nassisted proof in\nmathematics.\nA piece of artwork illustrating the four-colour theorem.\nWikimedia Commons\nThe four-colour\ntheorem was one of\nthe first significant\nmathematical theories\nto be proven with\ncomputer assistance.\n\u201c\n\n"

It may seem like I am ruining the story for you with this spoiler, but the destruction of our home planet is where the fun begins in this\ntale. The radio show was wildly successful, and went on\nto become a book series, an acclaimed television show,\nand a 2005 film starring Martin Freeman, in its leading\nrole, as Arthur Dent.\nArthur is our dressing gown-clad, perpetually confused hero who must come to terms with Earth\u2019s catastrophe at short notice, while tagging along with his\nfriend, alien journalist Ford Prefect \u2013 a writer for an\nelectronic encyclopaedia known as the \u2018Hitchhiker\u2019s\nGuide to the Galaxy\u2019. We meet many other memorable\ncharacters throughout his journey such as a paranoid\nandroid named Marvin, and Ford\u2019s egotistical part-play-boy part-criminal cousin, Zaphod Beeblebrox.\nThe Guide itself, however, turns out to be the true\nstar of the show. Numerous digressions and detours are\ntaken via the electronic book, as you are treated to its\nentries and asides throughout the pair\u2019s intergalactic\nadventures.This format is very successful and brings to\nmind Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick, a novel with similarly encyclopaedic nature, but this time with aliens, and a\nlot more laughs!\nThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide, with its many histories and\ndescriptions of strange worlds and creatures, is amusing and endlessly creative. There is an interesting mix\nof dry British humor and outlandish leaps of imag-ination, which is entertaining and, at points, quite\nprofound in its philosophy. Adams is said to have conceived the idea for the novel while drunkenly lying in\na field, looking up at the stars, holding a copy of\nHitch-hiker\u2019s Guide to Europe, a 1971 travel\nguide.\nIts writing process seems to have been\nsimilarly chaotic \u2013 he once\nhad to be locked in a hotel\nroom with his editor for three\nweeks in order to complete it.\nHowever, it is wonderfully put\ntogether and, arguably, is his\nbest work.\nAn internet-savvy generation might not appreciate\nthe novelty of Adams\u2019 idea of an electronic guide with\nthe knowledge of everything and everywhere, but this\nconcept is at the heart of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide, and is\nkey to its iconic status within science fiction.\nThe BBC2 television adaptation conveyed the exciting possibilities of this digital world through old-school\nvideo graphic techniques. (It\nis worth a wath, fragments\nof it can be found in the dark\nrecesses of YouTube.) Both the\nTV and radio show hold up incredibly well 40 years since release and are great companions to further explore the worlds created by Adams.\nThe novel itself remains timeless and extremely readable (and re-readable).\nSo, if you have ever had deep existential\nquestions in need of being answered, wondered\nwhat\u2019s out there beyond our galaxy, or been\nplagued by suspicions about what mice do all day,\nThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy could be\nthe book for you!\nThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide\nto the Galaxy review\nBOOKS\nDon\u2019t panic!

With its many adoring fans,\nthe Market is known for bringing people throughout the\ncommunity together, from both the College and the wider public. Despite how expensive it is, many would argue\nthat, for a weekly treat, you might as well try something\nnew from there.\nSounds amazing, right?\nNot quite. I work in air quality at Imperial College, and\ntherefore I am painfully aware that this weekly event\ncauses particulate air pollution to spike around campus.\nSo, how bad is the spike, and what can be done?\nFirstly, let me explain how air pollution is meas-ured. The \u2018healthy range\u2019 for the mass concentration of\nparticles under 2.5 micrometres (called PM2.5) is an average of 5 micrograms per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3\n) over the\nyear. We study the concentration of small particles because they cause inflammation that may lead to strokes,\ncancers, and even diabetes. Worryingly, the readings\naround the Farmers\u2019 Market exceed 500 \u03bcg/m3\n... over\n100 times the maximum limit recommended by the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO).\nThis air pollution seeps into indoor spaces as well \u2013 I\nmeasured up to 25 \u03bcg/m3\nin a room nearby that had all\nthe windows closed. Again, that\u2019s over five times the\nhealthy maximum.\nForcontext,accordingtotheresearchpublishedbythe\nGreater London Authority, the average level across London was 13.3 \u03bcg/m3\nin 2016. In their 2013 paper, exposure\nscientist Itai Kloog and others found that for every 10 \u03bcg/\nm3\nincrease in PM2.5 exposure there was a 2.8% increase\nin PM-related mortality, for short-term exposure.\nAccording to the Environmental Research Group at\nImperial,airpollutionaffectseveryorganinthebodyand\ncauses between 28,000 and 36,000 premature deaths in\nthe UK each year. It also impacts people unequally \u2013 the\nyoung, the elderly, people from deprived communities,\nand people with existing health conditions are most at\nrisk. Air pollution also generates \u00a320bn in health costs\nin the UK every year.\nClean air is essential for our health and the health of\nthe planet. While in reality, there is no \u2018safe limit\u2019 on air\npollution, the guidelines from the WHO are helpful to\nprovide some idea of what is acceptable.\nThe particulate air pollution at the Farmers\u2019 Market\ncomes from cooking at high temperatures. This burns\noils and other biomass, turning them into fine particles\nthat can sometimes be seen as smoke, though they can\nbe invisible when small. These particles are in highest abundance when cooking meats, wood, and spices.\nMoreover, overfrying tends to produce the highest emissions out of all common UK cooking methods. In gener-al, the lowest air pollution comes from cooking low-fat\nfoods (these tend to be plant-based) at low temperatures,\nwhile using non-burning methods such as electric elements or induction hobs.\nKeeping these in mind, both meat consumption and\ngas burning (gas is a fossil fuel) need to be drastically reduced to meet our climate targets and to reduce the scale\nof climate chaos.\nCooking on gas also creates harmful carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. Cooking at home is where\nmost people have their highest air pollution exposure.\nTo reduce air pollution when cooking at home: open\na window when cooking; use the microwave rather than\nfrying or boiling on a gas hob; turn on the ventilation\nhoodifitextractsoutside;cooklessmeatoranimalprod-ucts; and purchase an air quality monitor to keep track of\nconditions indoors, and help make healthier decisions.\nBut this article is not about how to avoid air pollution.\nIt is to stop air pollution at the source. People working at\nthe Farmers\u2019 Market and surrounding buildings should\nnot be exposed to a weekly dose of air pollution from\ncooking meats on solid fuels. The employees of the food\nstands and the College, and the students, have a right to a\nhealthy work environment. To emphasise, I do not think\nthe Farmers\u2019 Market should be abolished. We can keep\nthe Farmers\u2019 Market, but we must change what is being\nserved and how it is being cooked.\nMany researchers from Imperial College London\nadvise the UK government and the London Mayor on\nnational and city-wide air pollution measures, yet efforts\nto reduce the air pollution around the university itself\nare lacking. Sometimes, we need to look at what is happening right under our nose. Together, we must stop the\nFarmer\u2019s Market air pollution problem.\nTheFarmers\u2019Market\nair-pocalypse\nEveryone\u2019s favourite market has a negative\nimpact on more than just the student budget.\nEven standing outdoors next to food being fried is unhealthy.

Changes to the fabric of Imperial\u2019s estate, such\nas adding insulation, are limited by the age and variety\nof the buildings. According to Imperial College Estates\nOperations\u2019 People, Places, Spaces magazine, the plan\nis to move to a hybrid approach using air source heat\npumps (ASHPs) with gas boilers as a backup for high\nload. This allows the buildings to use lower carbon heating options without making the fabric-first changes\nthey might want to make.\nAcross campuses, Imperial is removing steam boilers and is trialling a heat pump. The College also has\nplans to retrofit buildings and introduce more LED\nlighting. On White City South Campus there will be\nno fossil gas and the sustainable materials should reduce the emissions of the Infrastructure Development\nPlan works by 28% compared to the initial proposals.\nWhite City Campus has also been designed to support\nmore active travel, which is supported by requests\nfrom staff for more cycling and sustainable travel op-tions.\nThe Arup strategy is in the process of being signed\noff by the Sustainability Strategy Committee, who\nshould be able to share more details once this is\ncomplete.\nFood\nFood systems account for 21-37% of global emissions\naccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange. Most of these are scope 3 emissions for\nImperial, arising from raising and feeding the animals.\nImperial\u2019s food purchases emitted 146 tCO2\ne in the 2022-23 financial year. This was a surprisingly small amount\nof the College\u2019s total emissions but hopefully food system emissions will be disclosed in more detail in future\nsustainability reports.\nImperial\u2019s Sustainable Food and Drink Policy sets\nout targets in line with their 2021-26 Sustainability Strategy. Most notably, the policy sets a target to\nreduce beef 35% annually until no beef is served in\n2025/26, and lamb in line with that. Beef herds emit\n99 kgCO2\ne/kg of beef and lamb emits 40 kgCO2\ne/kg,\nmaking them the two highest emissions intensities\namong major foods. Meat, poultry, and offal cover\nabout 35% of Imperial\u2019s food emissions \u2013 so policies\nhere are significant.\nAccording to Sustainability Strategy Director Harriet\nWallace, Imperial\u2019s targets are hopefully made easier to\nachieve by the fact that around 80% of students are willing to take up more of the sustainable food and drink\noptions on offer.\nScope 3\nWallace presented at a recent MRC seminar some more\ndetails on Imperial\u2019s scope 3 emissions. The indicative\nbreakdown of scope 3, which is 79% of Imperial\u2019s total,\nis:\n30% - ICT goods and services\n20% - Lab purchases\n20% - Business services\n15% - Capital expenditure (incl. lab kit)\n7% - Business travel\nOf the ICT footprint, around 8,000 tCO2\ne is from purchasing equipment and the other roughly 20,000 tCO2\ne\nis from software and associated servers. The electricity\nrequired to run equipment usually falls under scope 2\nemissions, so Imperial is checking they have avoided\ndouble counting here.\nOf the 7% of scope 3 emissions attributed to business travel, 95% comes from air travel. Imperial has\ncommitted to reducing emissions from air travel per\nperson by 25% by 2026 relative to 2018/19. The College\nalso recognises the importance of climate conscious\ntravel \u2013 meeting online where possible and taking\ntrains where it is not. Students and staff recognise\nthe importance of this too, with over 80% saying they\nwould be willing to adopt a more climate-conscious approach to travel.\nScope 3 is by far the most difficult scope to track\nsince it involves all the emissions created by products\nand services bought. Imperial is still working on calculating their scope 3 emissions, which is probably\nwhy we do not have historical data or many commitments here yet. This year Imperial came 98th in the\nPeople & Planet University League \u2013 scoring 50% in\nenvironmental policy, 25% in carbon management,\nand 33% in carbon reduction. This score puts the\nCollege at the very bottom of 2:2 class universities.\nBy comparison, King\u2019s College London came 5th overall \u2013 receiving 100% in environmental policy, 80% in\ncarbon management, and 78% in carbon reduction.\nClearly we have a long way left to go.\nI am impressed by the rigour and care being taken by\nImperial when it comes to calculating their emissions.\nThe College has set several ambitious targets and I am\nexcited to see them being met. Sustainability work is\nalways subject to scrutiny and we will only help by enthusiastically continuing to push for more ambitious\naction.\nGraph showing purchased electricity per full time staff and student equivalent from 2012/13-2021/22.

This\nmeans scope 1 emissions are higher than expected and\nscope 2 emissions are lower. This makes it more useful\nto consider scope 1 & 2 emissions together in most cases.\nSince 2018/19, Imperial\u2019s scope 1 & 2 emissions have\nnot changed, which the Carbon Report calls \u2018making\ngood progress\u2019 towards reducing emissions by 15% by\n2025/26.\nSince 2018/19, Imperial has seen a 12% increase in the\nnumber of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff and students\nand a 5% increase in estate size, so Imperial\u2019s emissions\nintensity when including either metric has fallen. While\nthis does show a genuine effort to reduce emissions, the\nCollege only has another 2.5 years to meet their target,\nso they will likely need to significantly speed up emissions reductions.\nBoth 2020/21 and 2021/22 were affected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, when we saw reductions in per FTE\nand per square metre intensities. Imperial increased\nventilation to reduce the chance of infection for those\nstill working on campus. This meant they had to heat\nmore air even though lectures were remote for some pe-riods, which explains why we did not see a substantial\ndecrease in emissions. Considering these years are the\nlatest data, it is hard to reach strong conclusions about\nfuture emissions.\nEnergy\nThe Carbon Report notes that \u2018CHP engines are a relatively low-carbon technology, and we would have been\nresponsible for greater overall carbon emissions had we\nraised heat in local gas boilers in each building and imported our electricity from the grid.\u2019 However, the data\nis now inconclusive. In 2015/16 the College\u2019s CHP engines were being replaced, so they generated no power.\nDespite this, the scope 1 & 2 emissions were about the\nsame as other years. The Carbon Report acknowledges\nthe need to move from CHP to renewable sources. When\ngrid emissions factors were higher, CHP would have\nbeen cleaner than other options. As the grid continues\nto decarbonise, the case for CHP will get worse \u2013 especially as infrastructure is improved to make heat pumps\nmore viable.\nThe balance between CHP and buying from the grid\ndepends on the grid emissions factors (part of the UK\ngrid greenhouse gas conversion factors), which we can\nexpect to continue to reduce as the UK approaches its\n2050 net zero commitment.\nEstates\nThe consulting firm Arup produced a plan for South\nKensington Campus and White City Campus which\naligns them with the College\u2019s 2040 net zero commit-Breaking down\nImperial\u2019s\n264,344 tonnes\nof pollution\nENVIRONMENT\nEnvironmentWriter\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nImperial\u2019s emissions in 2021-22. 21% came from scopes 1 & 2, within which 11% from CHP, 6% from gas for heating, and 4% for grid electricity Imperial College London\nTerminology\nbreakdown\ntCO2\ne: tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
