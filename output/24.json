    "content": "2 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nThe Editor takes no responsibility for views\nexpressed in this column.\nPHOT EST\nSirI wish, to protest against the continual comp la in ts from various quarters about the administration of the Musical Society. While it is true that the choir and the orchestra are each run by a member of staff, it would be difficult to find a student willing to take on either arduous duty.\nIf active members of the Musical Society ever comp la in that the staff are having too big a say in musical affairs, then, and only then, is an enquiry into the running of this body called for. It should be recalled that the Iviusical Society is one of the few which cooperate at all with staff or take any\npart in inter college activities. It is also the on lv society which has run something in aid of the T.B. Appeal Fund. Bearing this in mind, it seems\nrather unfair yet somehow typical of this Uniont hat it should receive admonitions from persons who\nhive never set foot in a concert hall in their lives, except to receive degrees.\nD. G.Rand all President, I.C. Mus. Soc. Sir The criticism expressed in the G.CC. Report\nto the Union A.G.M. was directed not against those members of the staff who have done so much for the Musical Society( and whose work is much appreciated) nor against the Mus. Soc's praiseworthy venture in staff student cooperation. It was directed against a student body so apathetic as to allow others to run their affairs for them; affairs moreover\nfor which there is apparently keen public support. It is to be hoped that the staff concerned may eve ntu ally be able to hand the Choir and the Orchest ra over to student officers and then to continue to cooperate in an advisory capacity. It is of course one of the functions of the S. C.C. to guide, and if necessary admonish its member Societies. A. V.S. de Reuck\nChairman, I.C.U.S. C.C. CHALLENGE\nSir The Mountaineering Club notes with interest Mr- Hazel l's correction to their correspondent's article in FELIX No. 22, concerning the initial traverse of the Union Entrance Hall. They believe however that they hold precedence over even the19*8/49 Rugby Club, as they have received similar and no less indignant corrections from I.C, mount a in e ers of pre-war vintage. The Mountaineering Club are pleased to accept\nthe invitation to a joint meet by the Lion's Flank. As a suitable occasion they suggest 9-00 p.m. on\nTuesday June 1 9 th, it being felt that late in the evening and close to so convenient a source of encouragement greater feats may be attempted and the joys of victory enhanced. They propose that the contest be staged between teams of four or five members of each club, the conditions proposed by Mr- Hazel l being satisfactory except that the state of the letter rack perhaps warrants progress in an\nanti solar direction. Yours etc., W.I. Stanton, ( President ICMCl\nRATING INTO MY GRANT\nSir May I use your columns to make a few remarks\nabout the refectory? I would like to complain about the insidious price increase of suppers. Under the new management we are offered the choice of meat roll( orr is sole or cod depending on the day of the week) under some fancy name for l/3j or, for1/10 there is an almost appetizing dish. Previous to this term the standard of the2/3 supper\nwas quite high, but now to get the same kind of meal costs2/9. However, I do think that the standard of lunches has improved* they are usually warm, and for1/2 the dish does include vegetables. I hear too that the salad bowl is quite good, though the name\nof it misled me to compare it with the salad bowl in J. Lyons, which costs3/ for as much as you can ent*' Yours etc, \"Merp\".\nAUNT FELICITY' S COLUMN Dear Geoff,\nYour question must be answered privately. If you will send me a stamped addressed envelope I will advise you.\nYours more in sorrow than in anger,\njiu nt Felicity. T^B^ APPEAL\nu ir May I, as Chairman of I.C.T. B. Appeals Comm it tee, thank the vast majority of your readers for \u00a3heir very generous donations and other forms of sup oort for our fund, which will enable us to send\nover \u00a3230 to the national fund.\nMay I, as an ordinary member of I.C. Union,\ndraw your readers' attention to something which surely indicates a very regrettable spirit. The\nMus. Soc. decided to sell tickets for one of their concerts to raise money for the T.B. fund. Norma ll y the Union pays the expenses of the conductor in this case \u00a35- Yet because this concert showed\na profit of \u00a39, the Soc. Clubs Committee decided not to grant the \u00a35 as this would be subsidizing the T.B. Fund from Union money. That such a body\ncould overlook that they would normally have granted \u00a35 and have thus reduced the T.B. Fund by \u00a35\nis hardly credible. Yours sincerely, J. P.O 'Brien.\nI.C. Union.\nSir Mr. O' Brien is misinformed. It cannot be\nassumed that the S. C.C. would \" normally\" have\ngranted \u00a35 for a Musical Society concert. The\nMusical Society has been exceptionally( and des-erve d ly) favoured this year in t ne matter of grants, but had nevertheless spent its entire income. The\nS. C.C., feeling that it could not have granted further sums to the Eus. Soc. for an extra \"normal\"\nconcert, decided that it could not do so for the\nT.B. concert. It was felt that neither the T.B. Appeal Committee nor the Union would wish the Union\nExchequer to subscribe to the T.B. Fund directly. In this the S. C.C. may have been mistaken, but the Committee certainly overlooked nothing in its discussion. A. V.S. de Reuck.\nChairman, I.C.U.S. C.C. LINKS '.MEMORIAL TROPHY\nSirI wish to apologise for and to correct a mist a ke that I made at the I.C. Union Annual General ii ee ting. When presenting the Links Memorial Trophy\nI mentioned that there was also a Memorial Prize to be awarded \" for the best, paper read before the Engi nee ring Society\". These were the original ter;;.s of the award, but it was found that they overlapped with the Faber Prize, and they were changed to \"the\nbest technical paper written by a student expressly for the Guilds Engineer\". Yours faithfully, E.M. Hughes,\nHon. Sec. , The Links Club. ARCHERY CLUB An Archery Club was launched at Silwood Park\non May 1 st and has at present a steady membership\nof about 10i 'Silwood Park members. It Is hoped that I.C. members at South Kensington Kill take advantage\nof the facilities offered, and will join the nev ly formed Imperial College To xo phil y Club, which it is expected will shortly reach competition standard.\nAnyone interested is asked to sign the notices which\nwill appear shortly in I.C. and the constituent, college unions. The present A.C.C. ruling is that the\nclub may call itself t ne Imperial College To xo phil y Club, but shall not have representation on the A.C.C until sufficient support from South Kensington is proved. It is hoped that it will be possible to call a General Meeting of the Club fort ne election of officers before the end of term. Tuc "

    "content": "FELIX IC BEAT CAMBRIDGE JUDO VICTORY\nIt was with trepidation that the team was\npicked to meet the much vaunted Cambridge side Cambridge who had easily beaten Oxford, who in turn had narrowly defeated I.C. Our fears were even\nmore pronounced when two of our higher grades, Wool d ridge and Al dred, both blue belts, were unavoidably prevented from participating. So it was that I.C. faced Cambridge on June\n6 th under the eagle eye of Mr. G. Koizumi , who had\nkindly consented to judge.\nThe first contest was between Gregory of I.C.;< nd Edmunds of Cambridge. Gregory was faced by\n.\n<\n? much heavier man of higher grade, but nothing dni tnt ed he resisted the crude efforts of his opponent and the contest ended in a draw.\nDove next faced Fletcher of Cambridge. The\nbout was short lived, Dove beating his opponent\neasily with two hip throws. The bout between Nay smith( I.C.) and Hobson\n(Cambridge*' proved interesting. Both were orange\nbelts, but Hobson was much the heavier man.\nsmith, however, moving skilfully and with overflowing confidence, especially on the ground, def eat ed his opponent with a neck lock.S il be;( I.C.) against Tennant (Cambridge)\nshowed how' skill can help to neutral is e superior weight and strength. Time and time again he was\ndragged to the floor by his opponent, who struggled fiercely to apply arm locks, but to no avail Gil bey calmly held his own and the contest ended\nin a draw.\nPakes (I.C.) and Smalicombe both struggled manfully but neither could gain the advantage.\nYoiinr is our biggest member and an at ch for most of hit: own grade. He defeated Carey of Cambridge comfortably in the allotted time with a chang'\u2022 ng hip throw and an ankle throw.\nPhillip s(I.C.) in his contest with Turner was thrown with a well executed Kata-Guruma in the first few seconds of the bout. He replied, however, with a skilful leg throw. Both men\nattacked in an effort to gain contest point and\nPhillips wis finally beaten by his heavier opponent .\nThe In st bout was between Everard( Blue Belt) of I.C. and Johnson ( Black Belt) of Cambridge.\nEverard was quickly thrown with a hip throw but\non rising to his feet attacked vigorously with hip throw and drawing ankle throw. On two occ-as ions he nearly caught the Cambridge man, but\nJohnson'sn uch higher grade and superior weight\nwere too .-such for him and he was countered as he\ncj mein for a left handed Ogo shi. The result of the match was a win for I.C.,32 with3 dx-aw s, and on the results of the cont est s, throe men were upgraded, Gregory to Yellow Belt, Youn, to Blue Belt, and Everard to Brown\nBelt. Well done, I.C.J. CI! K.A.I CRICKET I.C. suffered a sharp reverse at Southampton\non Saturday. University College, batting first on\na plumb wicket, scored264 \u20142 dec. in three hours, an il then dismissed us for133 The I.C. bowling was steady and never was collared, but It looked noticeably in penetration. A drizzle before lunch hampered the bowlers, and the few up p ish shots which were made did not go to hand.\nI.C. had 160 minutes in which to make the runs\nbu tin spite of K ibb le white's25 in30 minutes they never threw Southampton back on to the defensive. Hit chen an! Oldland made twenties but got out trying to force the pace. In the last hour the wicket began to take spin, and Rambaut and Weale were both victims of balls which behaved unexpectedly. Waterl and(27) fought a stubborn rear guard action but\nwhen he was caught at gully, reaching at one which he could hr ve left alone, the end was inevitable. SAILING I.C.S. Cv. King's College Sailing Club\nat\nWelsh Harp, Saturday2 nd June.\nKnowing the home waters of K.C.3.C. to be'up-river' at Shepperton on the Thames, the wind less dawn of the day of the rae e seemed to bode ill for I. C.S.C., used to the rough waters of the 'Welsh\nHarp' in winter. However, the light and temperamental breeze that eventually came up, in time for the first race, seemed to baffle King's completely. The\nI.C. helmsmen, used to racing regularly for U.L., were first over the line, and King's were not seen\nagain until they staggered into fill the last three places. In the second race, when the I.C. crews and\nhelmsmen changed places, King's were again placed fourth, fifth and sixth, with, happily, no protests in either race; and if they left feeling rather subdued, it was not due to any lack of friendliness, as was shown by the sharing of a sustaining lunch provided jointly by the refectories of I.S. and\nK.CL. Some members of I. C.S.C. remained to sail off heats in the championship, which has been held throughout the year. D. Gear and J. Conway-Jones\nare now finalists. R.F. ROWING OHISWIOK AMATEUR REGATTA. Saturday, 2nd. June\nI.C. were represented in the Thames Oup\nby the 1st. Eight& in the Ohiswick Pairs by C.H. Bar wise and S.J. Peerless. The Eight was rowing in its first regatta,& in spite of a mishap and some curious o ox lng by\ntheir opponents, put up a most promising first appearance. Drawn against London University and\nWestminster Bank in their heat, 1.0. did not have a ole an start owing to Fire coming off his slide on\nthe first stroke and rowing on the runners for the\nnext six. They recovered quickly and well& the\nlast half of the first minute and the whole of the\nsecond were very good indeed a high rating with a good rhythm and the or ew well together. Er ratio steering on the part of U.L. caused a lot of unnecessary rudder ing, which, a de fed to a wash\n& being out of the stream, makes the result, a2 lenght s defeat by U.L., sound worse than it was.\nIt was an encouraging row. A little more\nprecision in timing the work at the beginning and\nmore solidity at the finish, especially on bow aide, should bring forth great things at Walton.\nThe Pair won their first heat, rowing down\nAu riol, to win by 2 lengths. In the final, they\nwere not helped by their steering and lost to a useful Un iv. Coll. Oxf. pair by a similar distance. BOXING\nCongratulations to Hugh Huck in( R.S.I. I.) on his election as U.L.

    "content": "FELIX 6\nPRO BONO PUBLIC O It was vith a deep feeling of shame that I heard\nof the proposal for a FELIX dance. Shame, ts cause of the great respect and admiration I have always\nheld for FELIX in which, as a member of Imperial College, Union, I have a very personal interest. How could the Board of our newspaper lower itself to run a dance? Better far to perish in honourable\nbankruptcy than attempt to make money by such means.\nI watched the dance for twenty minutes and there, above, were women in the arms of real men obviously enjoying themselves while, down below, most of the s of as had a man and a girl sitting together with not even a copy of 'The Times' between them. I turned away in disgust and sought the hallowed sanctuary of Hyde Park, there to meditate on i mm or events\nali ty, for, regrettable a3 the fact may be, I am\ndriven to the conclusion that Imperial College is riddled with immorality. Asa proof of this startling statement, let me\noffer some facts, perhaps unpalatable but nevertheless facts, on the subject. Most conducive to a possible introduction of lechery into Imperial College is the institution known as the'Bar'. On the very night of the FELIX dance this place was filled with members of the Boat Club, who were holding a a( not undeserved) celebration. Incredible as it may seem, and although I have no positive proof, I am quite certain myself that some people in the' Bar' that evening had been partaking of alcoholic liquor. Indeed, I was ft cr ced to the opinion that there was\none gentleman there who was VERY NEARLY INTOXICATED!\nQuite shamelessly, he was singing at the top of his voice a song. I must hope that I was not hearing the words correctly, for some of them suggested\nthat it was not the type of song suitable for a gathering of God fearing oarsmen.\nHowever, the 'Bar' is not the only cause of disquiet to my mind. Our unhappy contemporary,\nthe PHOENIX, has, in its last three issues, pub li shed revolting short stories. The latest of these\nint rod u ced three pagan goddesses - the effect of this on the religious instincts of some our more\nimpressionable engineers is unthinkable. The first story merely praised loose living but the second\nmentioned BY HAFTS a building which is never refer red to in the best society. Doubtless these short stories were all accepted because they were re gar ded as having cultural value, and culture is sneak-ing into our lives more and more each week. Those\nin authority who actually encourage the unsettling effect which culture has on scientists will have\nmuch to answer for in another place. It is to be\nhoo ed however that they will attempt to bring home\nto the Editor of PHOENIX an understanding of his responsibilities. Finally, I would like to raise the problem\nof I moe rial College Women's Association. Doubtl ess, those in authority at the time of the foundation of Impeirial College had their own peculiar reasons for allowing men to mix freely with women.\nCertainly there are no possible reasons now. The\ndistracting effect of the knowledge of a women's lounge but ten yards away from where they are reclining may easily be imagined, and, in any case, is there not something indefinably disgusting in the thought of a woman doing practical biology in the some Is b oratory as a man? Of course there is but the time has now come for me to make a definite proposal to end immorality in the college. I' ro pose the immediate formation of a Purity Lea uc, Its aims would be as follows: to abolish the institution known as the 'Bar'; to transform the: Pili '-NIX into something which might, without undue exaggeration, be termed a Christian magazine;\nto Ian uc na monstrosity as the female scientist; and to abolish organizations capable of abuse.such\nas the Dramatic Society, and functions of doubtful reputation,such as the various dances, leaving the\nGymnasium free for use as a shrine. All moral me moers of Imperial College are asked to support this venture. D GR SOCIAL FRIDAY 15th JUNE - I.C.

Before checking fingers and feet for damage I bought one four nen ny fare from the cond u ctor. He also answered my question how long it took to get to Barnes - that it took some two\nhours, depending upon the turn round at Liverpool Street. In the days of the horse buses, so my\nsenior female aunt says frequently, it was different; but to address a horse with the familiarity due to a niece, is tantamount today. All this time I had been aware of the presence\nof my new plate which had been fitted that after noon. False teeth bring up some interesting points. At a party a deathly silence can be relieved by waving them; or when visiting children in an election campaign, a reply isp ossi hle to the base-gums grin of the smaller infants. On\nthe other hand if you break the plate, you lose the initiative; your friends address you aas 'Vamp-ire', and a visit to the dentist can no longer be\navoided; His chair is supposed to be a good way\nof filling in time. I appear to be short of a story, and this whole thing arises because I am among the unlucky number that must leave the college this year. It is inevitable; but you may comfort yourselves that there are those who want to go out into th world of continuous routine or civilized finality. I have to go because I can't find a way out.\nImp.\nIC CHOIR Dr. REGINALD JACQUES (Conductor of the Bach Choir) has agreed to conduct Imperial College Choir from\nTuesday Oct. 2nd next - i.e. from the FIRST day\nof next term - at515p. m.int ne Council Room,\nC.&.G., and thereafter on every Tuesday.\nWhy not SINS next session, and enjoy yourself; Advert in tube station:\"'.

    "content": "4 FELIX PROFILE- CLIFF HARGREAVES\nWhen seeking an insight into a person's character it is instructive to stud y the behaviour to their domestic pets. These animals having their own personal character, it is perhaps more reliable to cons ider some inanimate possession; and what more appr opiate object than an umbrella. A prominent member of the elite\" b roll y brigade\"\nwill soon be passing from amongst us. I refer, of course to Mr. CM. Hargreaves, until recently Editor of FELIX. Now, lest the above observation be misconstrued as a reflection on this mor thy gentleman,\nI must hasten to add that the very ownership of such\na device gives a remarkable insight into C.M. H.'s character. Actually to enter a lost property office and purchase this wonderful instrument would\nrequire a prodigious nerve and self possession far above average. Then to return to College and saunter brazenly round the quad non chant ly swinging the b roll y:Ah, here is a man indeed!! See the crowd\npart to let him by, and woe betide anyone who gets in his way, for the b roll y is unrivalled as an offensive weapon and Hargreaves is not a man to be\ntrifled with. But what of the other Hargreaves - Hargreaves the woman-hater, Hargreaves the abstainer from alcohol and tobacco? Unfortunately we know little of his early life. Born tired, he has never really overcome this handicap, yet he is a very energetic member of the Union,and the successful evolution of this paper was due in no small measure to his unremitting efforts. He has always taken a leading part in the many facets of FELIX production; whet her it be writing seriously or flippantly, de ve loping our photographic technique, or advising on\nprinting matters. Last but not least, he is always\nto the fore on those hectic Sundays when we 'make\nup' FELIX. '\"\nForeman who has taken a degree in Physics his interest in science is remarkable.

It seem-ed, he had thought, as though the world travelled round them, while they were standing still, only pulsating dreamily in the even rhythm of the music.\nWhat gift was this, so recently a half seen vision of the night, but now apart of him, blending with his movements,\nso close aa to drive out the separate ess from between them, her hand holding his fast, her face lying against the tweed of his jacket, the intoxicating perfume of her hair soothing his head buried there. But then it happened. He felt it suddenly as if something between them had broken, was slipping slowly away from\nthem: and by the stiffening ef her body a and the momentary imperfection of tie rhythm of their movement, knew that she\nfelt it too. What could it be? It was nothing he nad said, for neither had spoken since he had taken her in his arms i their love needed no words. He was not drunk, he\nknew, for he could not distinguish the melodies that were played; except with the exciting nectar of her presence and\nintoxication of this new, perfect love. But still they danced pressed close together to prevent the rift they felt be tween them growing wider. The music stopped, and still linked together they made their way from the dance to the coal blackness of the night. There they stayed, each conscious only of the desire for the other, but with the knowledge that what they did not want to loose from between them, was stealing from them. The strain which grew be tween them stifled their kisses, killing the full enjoyment of their love.

Cup by beating King's54 over no less than5 days. The first day's play on Saturday26 th May was stopped when only two sets had been played so it was decided to continue on the following Tuesday. But when Tuesday evening came, it was found\nthat v. 'right, one of our first pair, was still en gaged in a tournament at Surbiton, so Smith, who\nhad previously been an on playing captain, took up\narms in a hastily reconstructed first pair. Earlier in the afternoon, Forbes and Macdonald\nhad twice won after being very close to defeat and Grossman and Watson had comfortably beaten their opposite third pair, but had lost their other two\nrubbers. So at the crucial stage, the rubbers stood at three all and the new first pair had to win two of their three matches to bring victory. Light permitted only one match to be played that evening and before the usual supper time crowd,\nthe I.C.p air were beaten in three sets by the King's first string. Things, therefore, looked black for I.C. when the battle was resumed on Friday June 1 st. Cur pair started badly losing the first set62. Their play improved in the second set which, amid\nthe cheers and applause of some 150 supporters, they won in record time. We feel that the support of the residents in choosing this moment to parade to a photograph and afterwards make a mass reappearance\nhad its effect on both sides. After leading41 and dropping two match points at54, the home side were once within two points of defeat. However,\nthey rallied and eventually won 11 - 9-The final rubber was not without its thrills. In the first set we were down 4 - 0 but took the set at64 and went on, amid the gathering dusk, to win the second set and the match.\n.Vhether we win the final or not, this match will certainly be remembered as the one in which Smith played a capt in' s innings. All supporters will be\nwelcome at Motspur Park on Saturday, June 1 6 th, for the final round of the Championship.\nB.J. S.B.H.

At the second bend,\nwhich was in Reading's favour, Reading made a serious challenge but I.C, were unruffled and striking a lower irate held them off to win by a canvas.\nIn the second heat I.C. met Lensbury R.C.; this time I. C.had the other station and by the end of the first bend were half a length down but rowing\nwell they proceeded to row their opponents down\nand soon regained the lost ground and went into the lead. J hen with the advantage of the station and\ngood lively rowing they pulled away to win by a length. The best effort however came in the final when\nSt. Paul's School were the opponents. St. Paul's went away from the start and soon had half a length's lead, this was recovered on the first bend, which was in I.C.'s favour, I.C. continued to improve\ntheir position and at about the half way mark they were a length up. Then St.rau l's rallied magni-fi cent ly and fought back hard and pushed I. C.all the way to the finish, I.C. winning by length. This success is a great tonic for I.C. rowing\nand augers well for Henley which this year will be on July4 th,5 th,6 th and 7 th, when many over seas crews will provide tough opposition. FIRST VIII AT THE FINISH\nThe crew:- G.W. Benson (bow), R.G. Seaman,\nJ. CM. Taylor, H. Metcalfe, P.G. Essam, A.G.P. Davidson, D.A. Dunton, P. D.R. Maitby ( Stroke),D. W. North\n( cox). PAST PRESENT& FUTURE Since the Annual General Meeting several elections have taken place for senior positions and I should like to record, here in the pages of FELIX,\nmy sincere wishes for a successful year to Wally Goss, the new A.C.C. Chairman, and R.A.B. Mac fie who will be looking after the S. C.C. next year. As some of you will heard, the finances of the Union will have to be watched very carefully next session. Next year's President, D.K. Nicholas, is, I know, perfectly capable of doing this but, nevertheless I hope his job will not be as\ndifficult ae a prediction at this time would suggest. If he and his Hon. Secretary, N.L. Sanways,\nree e ive as much support from the members of the Union as he and I have received this session then they must necessarily have a very successful year in all the many spheres into which the irrespective posts will take them; and that is what I wish them. _\nContinued on pape 3\n\n"

What a year it has been! There is no doubt I.C. has had a remarkable year and FELIX has been privileged to report a large number of successful social and athletic events. It may be amusing to look back on the year through some of our headlines: Albert Memorial Conqueredl - Sir Bruce White advocates ' Safety Last'( CommemHioration Day) - Quiet Week-end (Nov. 5th) Mines Win 1950 Morphy Cup - Imperial College Exp editions Rugger in Paris Refectory Deficit A;, gain - King's Win Road Relay Coomber Elected President of U.L. U. Rector Visits America Guilds Skyl on Race. These are only a few of the highlights of aye an? packed with incident. We\nhave won no less than five University Championships:\nfor Boxing, Shooting, Sailing, Chess and Hockey; we\nwere runners up in the University Athletics and\nhave reached the finals of the Lawn Tennis Champi on ships to be played off next Saturday. The\nMines won the Morphy Cup, Guilds the I.C. Sports, and R.C.S. the Technology ( Soccer) and Sparkes\n(Rugger) Cups. Many other splendour s deserve to be recorded: we cannot end without saluting the new\nBowling Club, Derek Coomber,the new President of U.L. U. and our old friend Dai Nicholas now ascended to the throne of I.C.A monumental year! Jolly fine form! It's all bosh! I'm off to the bar.

In\nparticular his Profile il last rations have vividly revealed the identity of our victims. J. W. Midgley.\nFELIX BOARD\nNext year we must expect some gaps, in addition to literary lapses, in the survival of our members\nthrough examinations and grants committees. Anyone\nwho has ever thought of joining the staff of FELIX\nnext year should get in touch With the Editor. No\nexperience is necessary, but a little spare time\nand the need for an opportunity to learn to write\nare the best qualifications. Articles, letters, reviews are especially welcome from contributors who have not the time for the\nroutine of the Board, and the Editor would be plea sed to meet prospective correspondents on particular subjects. \u2022\n1951/52 FELIX SUBSCRIPTION ORDERS\nMany students leaving this year will no doubt\nlike to keep in touch with College affairs through\nFELIX, and take out a subscription now.
