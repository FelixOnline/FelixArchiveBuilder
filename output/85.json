    "content": "2\n%4'd<> \u2022 JOHN EVANS Althougu no organised selection was used, we\nhave decided that John Evans was the FELIX\n\"Sportsman of the Year\" for1955. This is based\nupon his achievements in athletics and cross country\nrunning.\nJohn, who is nearly twenty three, was educated\nat Westminster City School. He liked playing soccer,\nand wished to follow in Stanley Mathews footsteps,\nhut he was usually in the reserves after the selection\nof teams had been made. He found he was a better\nnatural runner than ball player, and for the last seven years has taken advantage of this. He la ft school when sixteen, to work with Soil Mechanics,\nLtd., and studied as a part time student at Northampton Engineering College for his intermediate\nexamination.\nSince he came to I.C. eighteen months ago, John\nhas devoted a lot of time to touring Europe for race\nmeetings. This has led him to joining the great rank\nof 1st year repeats ( in Civil Engineering). As a married man, he is now more con cie n to us and hopes\nto do better this June by missing some of the race\nmeetings.\nPREFERS TRACK RUNNING\nAt present, John Evans is training for track\nevents, the mile being his speciality, though an.i occasional two miles is not too tiring. He says\nit is incidental that this improves his cross\ncountry, in which he won the University of London\nChampionships in December, and came sixth in his County Championships (Middlesex) last Saturday.\nJohn's track results have not been startling victories, since he races against far more developed athletes, but this fiercer com pet ion has\nenabled him to produce times such as 3min48.2 secs. for 1500 metres at Stockholm, and 4min.8.2 secs. for the mile against the R.A.F. He was second in both these races, but his outstanding major victory was when he won the 1500 metres for the British Universities at San Sebastian last summer. John\nactually considers club running to be far more\nimportant than individual achievement.\nTraining for racing takes two hours each day\n(usually lunch hour) for six days a week. John\nspends more time as secretary of the University Cross Country Club, so that his recreations have\nto be fitted into odd moments to suit his marital, athletic and academic commitments. He is fond of\nfiction stories, which he reads extensively with\nno preference for any particular author, and likes listening to choral and piano music.\nWhen asked his dislikes, John could only think\nof poached eggs and \"The Archers\".\nHis ambitions, to pass his exams this summer,\nand to do well in the A.A.A. Championships this July, have changed considerably from his Soccer\naspirations seven years ago.\nTHE MAGAZINE OF THE\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\nWILL BE ON SALE AGAIN NEXT TUESDAY\nFOR THOSE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH NOT\nTO HAVE PURCHASED A COPY ALREADY\nTHE LADY'S NOT FOR BURNING.\nStill handicapped by the absence of suitable\nUnion premises, the Dramatic Societies Christmas\nproduction was performed at the Chanticleer\nTheatre during the last week of last term. This\nsmall theatre ensured a packed house for the three\nnights, and the audience were given excellent value\nin entertainment.\nThe College Society normally selects a play\nwhich must be a great success or a miserable\nfailure, and their ambitions were again fulfilled in tackling \"The Ladies not for Burning\". The\npractice of encouraging fresher s to take the\nna j or it y of parts was continued, so that seven\nplayers out of the eleven were new to the I.C. stage. They showed the society to be well endowed\nwith fresh talent. The parts were excellently cast,\nthough it would be unfair but much easier to pick\nbut the few actors who were not quite so well selected due to late changes in the cast.\nthe acting of Judy Kornbluth and Les Allen was as excellent as would be expected by those who\nhad seen them together in Antigone. Edna Thornton\nplayed her part as mother to a tiresome household\nextremely well, and will no doubt find a similar role in future productions. Dick Saunders gave us\nan amusing caricature of a Chaplian, while George\nHartnup and David Griffen played their parts with great amusement to the audience.\nIt was possibly the compactness of the theatre\nthat made the facial expressions of the actors\nmore noticeable than in previous productions\\ this feature being outstanding. The colourful costumes\nwere skilfully chosen to suit the various actors.\nThe director, Ian Duff, is to be congratulated\nupon another fine production, towards which his stage staff contributed considerably in making\na success of the theatre at hand in such short\ntime at their disposal for preparation.\nA SCENE FROM THE LADIES NOT FOR BURNING.\nI.C. Union General Meeting\nAn I.C. Union General Meeting was held in guilds\non December 8th. THe lengthy business o* approving\nthe accounts of the Union,the books tall committee\n;he a th lj tics clubs committee and the athletics grounds :om mitte e was dispatched efficiently. A motion to the effect that Council should look\ninto the question of discrepancies in gr any s and\ndo what they could about it,was proposed by Mike\nWalpole and seconded by Brian Davies.Mr Walpole\npresented his case very forcibly and clearly. The Presidentthen said that Council was opposed\nto the motion and,with Keith Miller's help,gave\nits reasons including the facts that the Union\nwas constituted only for the social, cultural and\nathletic needs of the students,that I.C. should\nnot be acting alone in the matter and that a similar motion asking for opposition to the\nextradition of Iraqi students had been rejected\na year before.Mr Walpole replied that this had\nresulted in a number of students being shot.At\nthis a voice from the direction pf the bench-smashing element at the back remarked\"Oh dear\".\nCouncil's case was heatedly opposed from the\nfloor,an amendment to the effect that the matter\nshould be pressed at the level of the U.L. Presidents' Council misfired and the vote came down\nheavily in favour of the motion .\nOf the Any Other Business,a gentleman who\nwished to wear a black blazer received little sympathy and eat down frustrated and John Nicholl wanted us to rejoin N.U.S. "

    "content": "FELIX INVASION\nTOUR by DELFT R.F.C. Last week the traditional peace and quiet of\nImperial College was shattered somewhat by the\narrival of seventeen high spirited rugby-playing\nDutchmen, who had come from the notorious Societe it Phoenix of Delft University. They soon established\nfriendly relations with the warden by asking him\nwhether they could climb up the Hostel walls: his\nmaniacal laughter which greeted this request evidently impressed the visitors, as no mountaineering\nwas undertaken.\nOn Tuesday, January 3rd., Harlington was the\nscene of another encounter between I.C. and the\nDelftsche Studenten Rugby Club. The enthusiasm of\nthe Dutchmen playing rugby is rivalled only their enthusiasm for drinking \"Genever\". However, although\nthe Delft team fought very hard, they are not accustomed to playing against such ski lf ml opposition\nand the t lost by 30 points to6. The I.C. three-quarters gave a fine exhibition of passing a \u00bbd running in which the forwards frequently joined:\none scissors movement between Weale and Kitchener\ncompletely bewildered our opponents. We can be\nsure that the Delft players will have learned much\nfrom their matches with I.C., King's, and Kingston,\nand they possess several talented individuals who\nshould be able to blend their fifteen into a worthy fifteen. The Harlington beer made a tepid start to the\nevening, but the Harlington whisky restored AngloDutch reLations, although at one fct age the very\npavilion seemed to be threatened,\nits contents both survived with\nonly a few cuts, and Delft were able to attend the\ndinner which I.C. had arranged for them the follow\ning evening. As one >1r Jannierk said,\"Tonight T';hink we make a great beer-feast\". We certainly die\nmake a great be rr feast, and the Dinne included\nsome amazing speeches from Dutchmen and English men a like. An I.C. crest was presented to Delft, who returned the compliment with a magnificent\ntankard in Delft china. I.C. now have a good\ncollection of Delft china trophies, which it is hoped will be displayed suitably in the new bar.\nOn and off the field, the men or u ex iz revealed\nthemselves as sportsmen of the highest calibre. They admired certain British institutions notably\nrug ger songs, whisky and St.Pauls Cathedral, but\nof others, especially the weather, they were\nrightly critical. Once again we found their como any most stimulating, and we can only hope that they\nenjoyed themselves as much as we enjoyed enter-tai ning them.\nexistence of the\nThe pavilion and\n.G.

Championships\nT.C. REATEN BY U.C. On Saturday, Dec. 10th, last year the\nUniversity Cross-Country Championships were held\nover miles at Rochampton.\nI.e. also held their inter college championships simultaneously. The final result of this could have been easily forecast before the race\n(1) Guilds, (11) R.C.S.,(111) Mines.\nIn the University match, however, things were\ndifferent. U.C. were very strong, and the I.C. team was the strongest for many years.\nWe had 5 teams in the race, altogether, which\nwas the largest entry from any college.\nA fall of rain the night before had made the\nhorse-rides firmer, but there was quite a strong,\ncold wind blowing. This did not deter John Evans,\nof I,C. from winning the race in37 seconds under\nthe previous record time, for which he im st be\nheartily congr u late d. Bill Pain was lu r next man\nhome, in7 th position, and the other of the scoring\nfive-were Conway(12th), Barber(15th) and Webster(19).\nChas Cotter ill must be thanked for his efforts for, although he did not score, he rose from a sick-bed\nto run.\nThe second te an did extremely well to finish in 4th position, being beaten only by U.C., T.C.1 st. and L.S.E. Mention must be made of John Collins, whose beautifully timed spurt half-way through the\nrace gained him many positions and made him first man home for the 2nd tea n,in27th position. ic wsc MATCH RESULTS AUTUMN lt foo.

WINE TASTING\nBetween Christmas and the New Year, the\nCollege Vintnors moved from their cellars near\nConnon Street Station to a much more extensive\nsere ies of caves in Southwark. To assist in transference of stock they asked fifteen, students to\nhelp them for three days.

MACHINES HIRED WEEKLY OR MONTHLY\nImperial College has produced yet another\nlittle booklet for the guide n ce of its members;\nwe have the pleasure in reviewing the \"Wine List\"195556. Whether we should criticise this book for its literary merits or the wine selection committee\nupon its taste is a moot point, and our wine correspondent has passed the sixteen pages on to us with\na few observations in the hope that a more general\nrepresentation of the student body would not indulge\nin 'Connoiseurmanship'.\nThe book is as lavishly filled with maps as the\nfront page of this edition of FELIX (the Wine List has red print as well as black). Fifty one wines and\nli quer s are numbered, in some cases simplicity of\nremembering just one number is hindered by various\nvintages being available for that type, so that the\n'O.K. Year' has to be written on ones cuff as well. It is interesting to note that the first paragraph of the booklet tells us that burgundy\nwith oysters would probably give rise to allergies and the second paragraph advises us that burgundy\nis a good wine to drink with oysters. Fortunately\nthis sabotaging of our health is not undermined\nelsewhere nearly so much as the under mi nine: of our\npockets. The prices are reasonable for what we are\ngiven, being in general those of the retail price.\nBut few wine drinkers on the continent have Chateau\nbottled or even Anoel Lation Controle\"e wines with their meals, since these are for very special occasions,\nwhich have to recur in I.C. with monotonous regular-it y. Besides the actual expense of having these types\nof wines, no half bottles are mentioned as being\navailable mak\u00bb<f drinking quite an ambi to us event\nfor only two people.\nIt has been rumoured that wines will be avail able by the car aft when we return to a dining hall with service next October. Perhaps cheaper wines\nwill be available: Italian wines (not mentioned in the list\") many people know to be available very,\ncheaply in Old Compton Street: French wines from\nLannuedoc and Spanish. Portugese wines are mentioned at prices of 5/6 and 6/6. These wines have less\nexport tariff than French wines.\nThe layout of the wine list is commendable,\nand the odd items of information are as instructive as the odd quiz. This concerns the Duke of Clarences'\nstrange fate in1473. No answer is s upn lied, so that\ndiscussion may proceed through out the desert.\nThe wine list on the back cover gives a good\nindication of the economic situation in various\nparts of Europe for the years 1932-5.3,\nFinally, we know now not to be put off by the\nchoi ee of three wines at ii all Dinner when the list contains 36 table wines. Since some of these need\nordering forty eight hours in advance, per hans we\nwill be told what the menu at formal dinners is at\nleast forty eight hours in advance so that we may\norder the most an nr opiate wine.

    "content": "FELIX\nViewpoint\u00b0\"j Vere Atkinson\nI must pay tribute to the literary powers of my\niri end and predecessor as Editor of Phoenix, Mr, J. Cox. The editorial produced in the latest edition demonstrates ir re futa bly the wealth of his i a a gina tio Seldom have I observed such facility in giving a coa fused version of the situation. Doubtless there\nare some grains of truth somewhere in his denunciation\nof the S. C.C. The trouble is finding them.\nOne of the more amusing fairytales he would\nhave us believe is that the formation of all new\nclubs is opposed on principle by the S. C.C. executive.\nHad he forgotten that the wine tasting society was\nformed barely six re on th s ago? How did he come under\nthis sad misapprehension?\nFor the un in r or med the Social Clubs Committee\nexists to control, coordinate and develop the\nsocial activities of I.C. The details of these\nactivities are managed by the various clubs with\na non athletic bias. The formation of new clubs and\ncoordination of finance is controlled by the S. C.C. on which a representative of each social club s it s.\\t the end of last session a Methodist Society\nwas proposed and it was intimated that a Anglican\nSociety was likely to follow. With two interdenominational Protestant Societies already in existence\nthe question was naturally asked would a cutting of the Protestant Christian cake on sectarian lines cause a diminution in the strength of the existing societies? Did not those societies provide for the\nsectarian demands of their members? The point was\nnot the intrinsic value of the sectarian splitting but the need for it. Arising.from this Council was caused to\ncontemplate the possible proliferation of re li go us societies. Mike Neale put forward the tentative suggestion that a certain amount of decentralisation would be of value to the S. C*.C. and in accord with\nthe spirit of a university. In his view a university should be a place where one met and conversed with\noffering views in order that the mind should be\nbroadened and one's own interests seen in perspective.\nCould not the re li go us societies amalgamate to form\na Religous Association which would coordinate all lectures, prayer-meetings, brain trusts etc.,\narranged by individual societies, and provide members\nsome insight into the variety of re li go us beliefs. Similarly an International Forum might\ncoordinate the activities of the Nationalist and\nInternationalist Clubs. The Nationalist Clubs,\nalthough they are by nature virtually exclusive\nin membership ( if you are born and brought up a Jew you cannot suddenly turn into a Arab) do an\ns xcel lent job in introducing their various students\nto their various cultures. A similar more general\njob is undertaken by the International Relations\nClub. Might not the insularity of the nationalists clubs be ameliorated and the development of further groups facilitated by de central ising the S. C.C. in this manner?\nFor completeness it was also suggested that the\nSocialist and Conservative Societies returned to\ntheir former union as subsidiaries of the old\nPolitical Society (thereby offering facilities for development of a club for Mr.Cox' friends the anarchists). This proposed decentralisation of the S. C.C. had the merits of providing for the further development and coordination of activity of the re li go us, nationalist and political societies while dec reas i the size of the S. C.C. itself._ The demerit, as was\nsoon eloquently pointed out, was the blow to the\npride of the individual clubs and their mutual\ndistrust( except the Christians?) of the thought\nof possibly leaving their representation on the\nS. C.C. to persons with the interest of another group\nat heart. Nobody recalled that the Marxist Literary Gromp has flourished for years with unabated vigour\nas a subsidiary of the Literary and Debating Society,\nor that there had once been Socialist, Concervarive\nand Liberal groups in the Political Society without\nanyone dying of apoplexy.\nMr.Cox ended his harangue by asserting that\nthe S. C.C. has outlived its efficiency and ave ring that his criticism is constructive. Looking through\nhis stimulating if involved per ovation one concludes\nhe does not like the proposal for decentralisation; constructive suggestions of an alternative organisation for the social clubs are conspicuous in their absence. Doubtless in a few months time he will have\nsome brain wave( such as chopping the S. C.C. in half) which will have us all gasping with admiration.\nUntil then we might reflect that all important S. C.C. decisions are taken by the full committee and not\nby the executive. And it cannot be such a useless\ncommittee if every club is so determined to remain\na member of it.

These expeditions will bring more publicity to our College,\nand show that we remain pioneers of ideas designed\nto produce industrial and scientific leaders.\nIt is now our responsibility to see that the\nsupport is given to these schemes. In this way\nmany pea ple will gain experience from the organ-is ation of an expedition, and at the same time\ntake some of the burden that the actual teams\nwill carry.\nThe nara kora m expedition is the most spec ta acul ar, and the initial organisation has been\ndone by three students experienced in mountain-ee ring. The proposed investigation of behavior\nof ara el tiu g ice-cap in\\ or way was made by an\nundergraduate fresher, D. Bridgewafcer, ef the\nR.C.S. This is the kind of student participation that we want, and the acceptance and co-operation\nof the Board in this suggestion shows that it is giving opportunities to the student body that\nwe hardly thought possible. Let us hope that when\nthe Board next meets to consider proposed schemes\nit will have a larger number offered, and that\nthese can all be given support.\nNelsons Column LE PREMIER TOUR DE SOUTH KENSINGTON.\nThe South Kensington Treasure Hunt organised\nby FELIX for its final issue last term did gather\nsome support di spite the rival attractions of carnival preparations, meals and the Post Office. The first people to find the Editor, who had\nthe prize carefully guarded, were Messrs J. L. Saunders and J.J. Sheldon, of the Electrical Engineering\ndepartment. Ten ni nut. es later, Messrs Boley, Stephen?\nStyan and Webber appeared, also 2nd year electrical s followed by John Bronson and Clive Pearse from the\nPhysics department.\nNo sabotaging of the notices occured by irate members of the public who were as bewildered by the\ncipher as some of the students, and no cases of\nobstruction of other uses of initiative were report-ed.\nThe prize of whisky was opened and sampled.\nConsolation prizes were drunk by many of the people\nwho finished the Treasure Hunt, and the success of\nthis venture was celebrated throughout the weekend.\nQueen Mother replies to Rector\nStudents will be pleased to read the following\nmessage that the Rector recieved in reply to the\ntelegram he sent the Queen Mother upon her installation as Chancellor of the University.\nWhitehall 3141\nCLARENCE HOUSE\nS.W.1,28 th November, 1955. f Dear Mr. Linstead,\nI am bidden by Queen Elizabeth The Queen\nMother to request that you will convey to the\nChairman and Governing Body, the Professors, Staff\nand students of the Imperial College of Science and\nTechnology. Her Majesty's very sincere appreciation\nof the dutiful message which has been offered on the\noccasion of Queen Elizabeth's Installation as\nChancellor of the University of London.\nThis message from the Imperial College,\nwhich plays such an important part in the life of\nLondon University, is very much valued by Her\nMajesty as Chancellor.\nYours sincerely, MiJ.GILLIAT\nAssistant Private Secretary to\nQueen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\nR.P. Linstead, Esq., C.B.E., F.R.S. MOQNEY'S CHRISTMAS DINNER The dignity of a formal dinner\nin Hall was tempered most delightfully with the Christmas\nSpirit to provide one of the most pleasant(and best value\nfor money) events of last term.The I.C.o hoi r, led by Miss\nImogen Hoist,gave a programme of o arol s in which everyone\n\"joined later.\nJOBS SINGING After the R.C.S.

Union,\nDear Sir, The student of manners will have been appall wd by the behaviour of some students during last term.\nThere were incidents when students were bad\nmannered and thoughtless, but, on occasions a few\npeople behaved like hooligans. It seems that the\npower to distinguish between fun and games and\nhooliganism has been temporarily lost. To quote the incidents already referred would\nbe imprudent but I feel that the attention of the\nstudents should be drawn to the damm age done in the\nGuilds after the last I.C. Union Meeting. Several\nbenches in the lecture room were found to have been\nwantonly damaged. The cost to the Union for the\nrepair to the seats amounted to \u00a315. Such behaviour\nby students of this College is very disquieting. In a few months a brand new building will be\navailable to. the Union and several thousands of\npounds will have been spent on the decoration of the\ninterior. WillI.e. students still continue to behave in a disorderly fashion when the new building is open? The fur ure leaders of industry will have\nto improve their be ha vio u unless they want to be\ntreated like schoolboys with distasteful rules and\nregulations.\nYours etc., Jim Anderson.\nTHE CLUBMEN DANCE BAND.
