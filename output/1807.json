    "content": "FRIDAY 7TH OCTOBER 2022\n21\nBOOKS\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nOver the long summer holiday, I had the opportunity to read many books, including Franz Fanon\u2019s\nThe Wretched of The Earth, Snowden\u2019s Permanent Record,andObama\u2019smonumental,768-page-longAPromised Land. Most of the books I read were enjoyable and\nprovided me with a new perspective on the world we\nlive in. However, one book stood out from the rest: Appeasing Hitler by Tim Bouverie, a strong analysis of the\nBritish government\u2019s response to the rise of Hitlerism.\nThe book begins with the man himself. Dictating\nhis opinions in his infamous manifesto, Hitler made\nclear to the world the character of Nazi ideology. Rumbold, the British Ambassador to Germany, and his\nFrench counterpart, Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet, both read Mein\nKampf prior to Hitler\u2019s accession, however, they arrived at opposite conclusions. The former viewed Mein\nKampf as a handbook for future Nazi policy, whereas\nthe latter believed that Hitler\u2019s manifesto was incidental to his true ambitions, the mad rambling of a failed\nAustrian painter, discontent with his position in life.\nThis divide between acceptance and marginalisa-tion is a running theme throughout Bouverie\u2019s book.\nIt is understandable that many people initially underestimated Hitler\u2019s fanaticism. To articulate ideas in\nwriting is one thing, to action those ideas is another.\nHowever, following his accession to power, Hitler\ndid put the egregious principles of Nazism into ac-tion. The Jewish persecution, the suppression of political opponents, and the rapid rearmament should\nhave alerted the allied powers to the dangers of Nazism, and the need to nip it in the bud by taking aggressive action. Unfortunately, they did not. The \u2018policy of appeasement\u2019 prevailed until it was too late.\nThis fatal weakness of the British and the French,\nBouverie argues, derives from three factors. First, public opinion was overwhelmingly pacific. Recovering\nfrom the traumas of World War I, the British masses\nfeared that military intervention would lead to another catastrophic war. Second, following the Great Depression and the crippling measures of the Treaty of\nVersailles, the plight of the German people drew the\nsympathy of the British public. Finally, the exaggeration of German aerial supremacy (at a time when aerial\nwarfare was seen as we view nuclear warfare today)\nalso dissuaded the British government from taking a\nmilitaristic approach to confronting the Nazi menace.\nAlthough rearmament was the focal point of\nnon-appeasers, there were pacific alternatives availa-ble, such as establishment of military alliances between\nBritain, France and Germany\u2019s eastern neighbours, as\nwell as imposition of resource sanctions on Nazi Germany and its budding ally, Italy. During the Second Italo-Abyssinian war, British intelligence and the Mussolini administration recognised that oil sanctions would\ncripple Italy\u2019s war efforts. The failure of the British to\nimpose these sanctions, out of fear that doing so would\nprovoke a retaliation \u2014 which would be detrimental\nto the Italians who would have to fight a war simultaneously in Europe and Africa and who possessed a\nweaker military \u2014 sparked in Hitler the idea that he\ncould do as he pleased in Eastern Europe. In addition\nto the inability of Chamberlain to establish \u2014 and\nfulfil \u2014 military guarantees to Austria and Czechoslovakia, this gave Hitler full confidence to annex those\nterritories in order to empower the German military.\nUltimately,thepolicyofappeasementwasirrational.\nDespitebeinguniversallyscoffedatbyhistorianstoday,\nthe notion that a war with Germany could be avoided\nbyallowingittostrengthenitsmilitarysawwideappeal\nin the 1930s. The marginalisation of Hitler\u2019s excesses\n\u2014 the contravention of peace treaties, the widespread\ndissemination of Nazi propaganda, and the flagrant\nviolation of human rights \u2014 is wholly responsible for\nthe belief, held by the dominant elements in the British\ngovernment, that agreeing to Hitler\u2019s demands would\nsnuff out his imperialistic ambitions. If there is one\nthingAppeasingHitlermakescleartothereader,itisthe\nneed for clear-headed\nleadership in times\nof global turmoil.\nAppeasing Hitler\nBooks Article\nJustin Macharia Books Writer\nSally Rooney: On Humanity\nAuthor Review\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\nWith the release of BBC Three and Hulu\u2019s TV\nadaptation of Conversations With Friends, I\nwas finally driven to pick up Sally Rooney\u2019s first two\nbestselling novels as part of my summer reading.\nWhile \u2018bestseller\u2019 romance novels tend towards clich\u00e9 and a little gimmicky, I couldn\u2019t help being intrigued by people\u2019s fascination with Rooney\u2019s work.\nSet in Ireland, both Conversations With Friends\nand Normal People follow \u2018regular\u2019 teenagers as they\nnavigate their daily lives and relationships. While this\nsounds like a fairly mundane concept, Rooney elevates\nit to classic status with her character-building. There\nis heavy focus on the main characters, highlighting\ntheir thoughts and opinions, strengths and flaws, and\nexploring the nuances of their personalities in depth.\nRooney\u2019s unique writing style takes a little getting\nused to; dialogue is written as regular text without\nquotation marks, rendering it visually indistinguishable from the descriptive writing in her novels. Both\nbooks are relatively easy reads once acclimatising to\nthis style. It has the effect of making one feel as though\nthey are actually witnessing events in the novel happen in real life, as opposed to watching a performance.\nIn the interest of space, this review is short and\nsweet. In summary: Rooney\u2019s acclaim comes from the\ndistinctive nature of her writing, but while I would\nrecommend reading these at least once if you\u2019re a\nfan of romance novels or anthropology, they\u2019re not\nthe kind of books that call to be picked up and read\nover and over. Regardless, something about Rooney\u2019s\nwork clearly speaks to people on a deeper level, as she\npicks apart the logic and madness behind human behaviour and the relationships we form with others.\n\n"

    "content": "Biopharma: Past, Present and Future\nIndustry Spotlight\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n22 Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBusiness\nZhifan (Ashley) Xu Business Editor\n20 Years Retrospective\nOver the past 20 years the biopharmaceutical\nindustry has developed significantly. Since the\nhuman genome was first sequenced at the beginning\nof the 21st century, scientists have been able to build\na stronger understanding of the human body, and\ndisciplines such as gene therapy, stem cell research and\nnanomedicine have come forward leaps and bounds.\nFurthermore, approaches to drug manufacturing\nhave change immensely, with single-use systems and\ncontinuous manufacturing becoming more viable each\nyear.\nNew treatment classes and production\nmethods\n\u2022 Gene therapy: The treatment of disease by\nrepairing or replacing defective genetic material, or\notherwise genetically modifying a cell to produce a\ntherapeutic effect. Therapy can be either somatic or\ngermline\u2013somaticcelltherapycancuretheailmentfor\nthe individual in question, whereas germline therapy\ncan remove the likelihood of the individual\u2019s offspring\nalso suffering from the disease. The field is still in its\nexperimental and clinical stages but has grown greatly\nsince the first clinical trial in 1990.\n\u2022 Stem cell therapy: Stem cells are unspecialized\ncells that can mature into one of multiple different\ntypes of functional cell. In the medical industry,\nscientists can use stem cells to replace diseased tissue\nwith new, healthy tissue. Specifically, researchers grow\nthem in a lab, guide the cells toward the desired cell\ntype by altering their environment, and then implant\nthem into patients through surgery.\n\u2022 Nanomedicine: This field involves the\nmanipulation of nanoscale materials - such as\nbiocompatible nanoparticles and nanorobots - for\ndiagnosis, delivery or sensing purposes. Continuous\nmanufacturing within the nanomedicine field could\nsignificantly lower operating costs and enhance drug\nquality.\n\u2022 Single-use systems: Single use bio-pharmaceutical processing systems offer a potential\nsolutiontocontaminationissuesandsterilisationcosts.\nThese manufacturing systems are designed for only one\nsingle batch of therapeutics and then discarded. They\nare manufactured in a cleanroom, double bagged and\nthen sterilized by gamma, EtO, or x-ray sterilization\nmethods. This approach ensures a sterile environment\nfor every batch and has proven, despite waste concerns,\nto be highly efficient.\n20 Years Ahead\n\u201cIn the next 20 years, industry experts expect to see the\nconvergenceofpharmaceuticalbreakthroughs,computing\npower, and democratisation of healthcare products,\nwhichwillultimatelydeliverfundamentalchangesinthe\nbiopharma industry\u201d (Deloitte, 2021)\n\u2022 Preventionandearlydetection:Theemergence\nof vaccines and improvements in wellness effectively\nhave reduced the chance of contracting diseases\nglobally.Inthefuture,bydevelopingpowerfulvaccines\nand whole genome sequencing, which identifies who\nmay be genetically predisposed to some diseases, we\nmay cure a disease before symptoms even surface.\nSimilarly, early detection through blood testing or\nbiomarker analysis has become possible. For example,\nliquid biopsy technology has the potential to identify\ncancer cells with one single blood test.\n\u2022 Customized treatments: Driven by data-powered insights, medical personalization can now\neffectively match patients\u2019 physiological profiles with\ncustomized drug cocktails, or design therapies that\nwould work for just a few people, or even a particular\nperson.\n\u2022 Curative therapies: This kind of therapy\nremoves the symptoms of a disease permanently or\nsemi-permanently. By contrast, with prescription\nmedicines, patients may need to take pills for the rest\nof their lives to manage symptoms. Types of curative\ntherapies include:\n\u2022 1. Biology-modifying drugs, which target the\ndisease-causing mechanism. For example, this may\ninclude interfering with virus replication.\n\u2022 2. Gene therapy, as previously detailed.\n\u2022 3. Genetically re-engineered cell therapy,\nsuch as CAR-T and stem-cell treatments. The most\npublicized form of its kind uses the patient\u2019s own\nimmune system to destroy cancer cells.\n\u2022 Digital therapeutics. The future product may\nprovide actionable insights, personalized coaching,\nand real-time tracking which allow patients to actively\nmanage their disease, and for doctors to intervene\nbeforesymptomsescalate.Prominentexamplesinclude\nSleepio, a digital sleep improvement program, and\nLivongo, a digital health management app for chronic\ndiseases.\n\u2022 Precision intervention: Technologies such\nas robotics, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering\nenable us to perform precise medical interventions.\nThey could lead to dramatically improved outcomes\nin cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory conditions,\nand chronic pain.\n\n"

    "content": "Over the last two weeks, I have received\n12 different notifications to articles\nthat all read along the lines of \u201c10\nways to decrease energy costs this\nwinter\u201d, or \u201cSave on your electricity\nbill with these simple ideas\u201d. Some of\nthe recommendations are repeats from\nprevious years: bundling up, not using\na kettle unless necessary, sealing\ndrafts.\nA large majority of\nuniversity students live in\nrented housing on yearly\ncontracts, and as such don\u2019t\nhave as much bargaining\npower to convince their\nlandlords to part\nwith the money\nrequired to make\nmajor structural changes\nthat conserve the most heat.\nReplacing an inefficient boiler\ncostsatleast\u00a34000,buttheaverageisjust\nunder \u00a38000, not including installation\ncosts. The problem with paying high\ncosts now for greater savings later is\nthat this requires heavy investment now\nfrom people who will have money later.\nCrucially as well, landlords are the not\nones that suffer from high energy costs.\nStudents in private accommodation\nprotect landlords from rising bills by\npaying themselves, a difficult feat given\nthat rents in London are already 20%\nhigher than they were last year.\nPoor wall insulation, according to\nNorthern Energy, accounts for between\n35 to 40% of heat loss in homes. This\nis massive when coupled with heat loss\ndirectly from the roof, which causes\nabout 25% of total heat loss. This then\nalso has to factor in that students can\nbarely afford rent, and favour older\nhomes that are less likely to be well\nmaintained, and live in basement-like\nrooms that are closer to the ground and\nhence lose a lot more heat.\nThere must be a realisation at some\npoint that the London does not have\nan infinite capacity to absorb people.\nHouse building in the areas that people\nwant to live has been non existent since\nthe 70\u2019s and pushing students ever\nfurther out to Acton and beyond is not a\nsolution but profiteering by the College,\nwhose actions in adding 3000 new\nundergraduate places do not pay any\nconsideration to where these students\nwill live in the following two, three or\nmore years they spend at the College.\nThis is not a solution for the\nCollege. It is an issue\nmuch larger than any\nsingle organisation,\nthat have pursued\nrational policies in\na market suffering\nserious aberration.\nInstead, sacred cows\nlike the green belt\nand planning and\nconservation policies must\nbe rationally re-examined. British\npeople love conservation, however, it\noften confused with environmentalism\nlending NIMBYs protecting the price of\ntheir house a moral fervour they do not\ndeserve. It is essential that the dialogue\naround house building is not allowed to\nbe polluted by American-style disgust\nat developers and their portrayal as\ngentrifiers. This attitude can only drive\npeople out of areas they have lived in\nfor years and condemn them to long\ncommutes.\nLondon can\u2019t become a city only for\nthe rich. As we all learnt during the\npandemic, London depends on the\npeople doing jobs many look down on\nand we forget them at our peril. The\nsame thing goes for students. If Imperial\nwants to remain a place where people\nfrom all walks of life can attend, then\nthe current housing situation is a serious\nimpediment.\n2\nJamie John\nDeputyEditor\nandChiefSci-enceEditor\nSam Lovatt\nManaging\nEditor\nHahyun Lee\nComment\nEditor\nJonah Hewett FilmEditor\nTara PalChaudhuri\nMusicEditor\nJoe Riordan MusicEditor\nZanna Buckland BooksEditor\nZhifan Xu BusinessEditor\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEnergy efficiency\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "If you\u2019ve ever been on campus during\ngraduation ceremonies, you will have\nheard the noisy bells that seem to ring\nforever while you were busy revising.\nYou might know that high up in the\nQueen\u2019s Tower there are ten bells that\nare rung for special events, the heaviest\nof which is nearly two tonnes. But\nhave you ever considered who actually\nmakes the noise and how they do it?\nBells have been around in Britain for\ncenturiessincearound400AD,butwhat\nwe call change-ringing has its origins in\nthe 16th\ncentury, when they began to be\nswung ~360\u00ba rather than 90-180\u00ba. With\nthe addition of the stay and the slider\n(see diagram to the right), the bell could\nbe balanced on its end in the up-right\nvertical position. This gave much greater\ncontrol and allowed bell ringers to\naccurately change the order in which the\nbells sounded, as opposed to the random\nswinging found in continental Europe\nat the time. Such control of the bell\nallows increasingly complex sequences\n\u2013 otherwise known as \u2018methods\u2019 \u2013\nto be rung by moving the bells in\ncontinuously-changing sequences.\nToday, bells are rung as both a fun hobby\nand to mark events, such as weddings\nand funerals, or the Queen\u2019s Jubilee.\nYou might be wondering what the\nrelevance of all this is in 21st\ncentury\nLondon. Perhaps the most prominent\nreason is that change-ringing is an\ninteresting and rewarding hobby that\nis almost unique to the UK. Best\ncompared to a very sociable orchestra,\nthe high levels of skill, intricate timing\nand inexplicable delight at success being\nvery similar, it can involve travelling\nall around the country and meeting\nplenty of new people in places which\nare off limits or costly for non-ringers\nto visit.

    "content": "The life and work of the spirit of the French New Wave\nFor the entirety of her 65 year career, Agn\u00e8s Varda\nembodied all that is good about cinema. Her feature debut, La Pointe Courte (1955), is widely considered to be the forerunner to the French New Wave\nmovement, one of the most important eras in the development of modern cinema - and one that, despite\nits association with progressively feminist themes,\nis often attributed primarily to four male directors.\nVarda often described three primary ideas as being central to her life and work; inspiration, cr\u00e9ation,\npartage. Inspiration - the reason why you make a\nfilm, the ideas and the context. Creation - the meth-od, the structure, the creative choices and the people with whom you make it. And partage - shar-ing. As she says in her final film before her death\nin 2019, Varda by Agn\u00e8s, \u201cYou don\u2019t make films to\nwatch them alone, you make films to show them\u201d.\nHere we present a criminally short synopsis of three landmark works from Varda\u2019s extensive ouvre, though this list is not exhaustive.\nCl\u00e9o de 5 \u00e0 7 (1962)\nOne of the most well known films of Varda\u2019s career,\nand for good reason. Cl\u00e9o de 5 \u00e0 7 follows a Parisian\nwoman in real time, from 5pm to 7pm, as she waits to\nhear the results of a test that may confirm her cancer\ndiagnosis. That\u2019s the premise, but in just 90 minutes\nof Cl\u00e9o\u2019s life the film leads us through an entire arc\nof her life. Cl\u00e9o is a young and beautiful singer at the\nbeginning of her career, and her life - whether by choice or circumstance - appears to be\ndefined by the perspectives of others. She\nskillfully enacts the various roles that she\nis expected (or perhaps expects herself)\nto; pop star, lover, and lady \u00e0 la mode, but\nit is obvious in her frequent consultation\nof mirrors that this is not making her happy - and the brooding threat of her own mor-tality, that she desperately tries to distract\nherself from, frequently consumes her.\nCl\u00e9o de 5 \u00e0 7 showcases many\nof the filmaking quirks that enshrine the New Wave - the scenes are shot on loca-tion, almost feeling as though Varda herself has just\ngrabbed a camera and started filming the citizens of\nParis, and none of the 50s Hollywood shine is to be\nfound here. But even more so that other films of the\nmovement, her training as a photographer is evident - every frame of this film is masterfully crafted.\nVillages, Visages (2017)\nBrilliantly translated as Faces, Places, this 2017 documentary follows Varda at 88 years old, as she travels\nthrough France with co-director JR, a French photographer and street artist. They travel in JR\u2019s photo-booth truck, taking portraits of the people that they\nmeet, printing them as huge posters and pasting them\non any walls or surfaces that take their fancy. It\u2019s an\nincredibly heartwarming and wholesome film that\nbeautifully encompasses themes of communi-ty, friendship, and a life spent sharing art.\nThe film also focuses on Varda herself\nas she approaches her 9th\ndecade, and\nthe less celebrated aspects of a long life\n- loss and ageing. But with it comes a\nsense of wisdom, of imparting her experience onto others, and a gratitude for\nthe life she has lived and the people\nin it. As she says in the film,\n\u201cIn fact, JR is fulfilling my\ngreatest desire. To meet new\nfaces, and photograph them,\nso they don\u2019t fall down the holes in my memory\u201d.\nVillages, Visages is a wonderful celebration of the\neveryday. Agn\u00e8s and JR photograph ex-miners, wait-resses, children, and their enthusiasm for meeting\neach and every one of these people is obvious. It\u2019s\nhonest, charming, and you should absolutely watch it.\nBlack Panthers (1968)\nAs much a master of reality as she was fiction, Varda\u2019s documentaries are empathic tours de force. Black\nPanthers, a documentary made whilst Agn\u00e8s was living\nin LA with her husband (himself an iconic filmmaker of the era), follows the famous black student movement of the same name. It\u2019s an open and honest portrayal of the people in the movement - achieved by the\nsurprisingly novel technique of letting them actually\ntalk, for extended periods, about who they were and\nwhat they stand for. Politically divisive at the time, the\nfilm never aired on French TV as it was supposed to\n- a fact that Varda suggests was due to the censorship\nboards not wanting to incite further student protest.\nAgn\u00e8s Varda: A Life in Thirds\nDirector Focus\nFRIDAY 7TH OCTOBER 2022\nEdited by: Jonah Hewett\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 19\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nImage credit: Criterion Collection\nWrite for Film!\nSick of reading about the same dreary\nold-ass black and white films?

    "content": "FRIDAY 17TH JUNE 2022\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\n25th October.\nQ: Is this not a big change?\nA: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big change,\nI think it seemed logical to me after\nhaving used the last three months engaging with my colleagues and team-mates. Many of them had come to the\nconclusion that the President [and]\nProvost Board worked really well for a\ncertain period of time, but given all the\npressures on the institution and on the\nleadership team, that now, more than\never, we need to have a single unified\nboard because the challenges are coming\nfrom all angles. We actually had our first\nmeeting this week. We had a residential\nwhere we met for a day and a half as a\nteam.\nQ: Is there something\nyou\u2019re looking forward\nto doing in the next\nthree to five years?\nA: I\u2019m looking forward to leading Imperial during what\nwill be exciting, but\nequally challenging\ntime. I think it\u2019s about\nbuilding on success.\nLooking from the outside,\nfrom my experience in\nDublin, Toronto, Boston and Bristol,\non comparing\nnotes\nwith\ncol-leagues, they comment, you know,\n\u201cWow, Imperial is really moving plac-es, that of all the universities in the UK\nit has probably moved up the ranks by\nan impressive degree where it\u2019s now QS\ntop ten of the world. It\u2019s also less well\nresourced than, for example, highly endowed American universities, or state-backed Asian universities.\nQ: Let\u2019s move away from changes.\nMental health was a major concern of\nstudents at Bristol. Is there anything\nyou\u2019veseeninImperial\u2019smentalhealth\nprovision that you think is good, or is\nthere anything you would like to bring\nto Imperial from Bristol?\nA: This is one of the most significant\npublic health challenges facing not\njust students, but staff as well. I\nthink in universities we are in\na privileged position where\nwe can often spot students\nwho are developing mental health issues early, and\nhelp support them. We\ncan help them transition\nto the NHS, but of course\nwe\u2019re not the NHS. I\u2019m de-lightedthatsomeoftheinitia-tiveswelaunchedatBristol\nare also engaged\nwith at\nImperial.\nFor\nex-ample, the opt-in policy whereas a student can nominate a friend or colleague\nor a former teacher or parent that we\ncan contact if we deem that they\u2019re running [into] some difficulties. One of\nthe things I\u2019ll be doing with colleagues\nis, saying it\u2019s certainly possible given\nall the things that are happening in the\nworld, that this is not going to go away\nas an issue. Mental health issues among\nstaff members and universities across the\nworld are increasing, so we will be ensuring that we have a whole institution approach to mental health, that all of out\ninitiatives are joined up, coherent, and\nthen networked into the NHS.\nQ: Let\u2019s talk about student engage-ment.YoumetwithOfficerTrusteesin\nlate August. You expressed at the time\nthat you\u2019d like to work with them, but\nso far, they haven\u2019t reported having a\nmeeting scheduled. How do you plan\non engaging with students?\n* We later realized that this meeting\noccurred on 5th September, 9 days before\nthis interview.\nA: I think this was only two or two\nand a half weeks ago, to be fair. I really\nenjoyed meeting with them and hearing their plans and priorities. This is the\nthird university that I\u2019ve been President\nof, so personally and professionally, I\ntake pride in engaging students as partners in all decisions that affect students.\nWhatIhearisthecaseinImperialisthat\nstudents have been really fantastic contributors at Council level; at university\nsenate level, at faculty level, and then\nwithin departments. What I found very\nuseful in the past was for members of\nmy team responsible for education and\nthe student experience to sit down with\nstudents as soon as they are elected to\nhear what their priorities are early, and\nthen schedule during the year a number\nof regular meetings. Certainly in my ex-perience, that\u2019s really worked. Equally,\nif they feel that there is an issue that\u2019s\nbrewing, they [should] let us know ear-ly. What we usually find very reassuring\nis the priorities are usually pretty similar on both sides. One of the issues that\ncame up over our residential was the\nimportance of regular and meaningful\nengagement with students on all issues\nthat affect them, and I\u2019ll be working\nwith [Dr] Peter [Brian, new Vice-Provost (Education and Student Experience]\nto make sure those will take place.\nQ: What do you think of ALERT?\nA: [Sir] Antony Gormley is undoubtedly one of the world\u2019s foremost living\nartists and so we\u2019re delighted to be gifted\none of his pieces of work. I haven\u2019t seen\nit yet, and I imagine like any piece of art\nis supposed to be inspiring and challenging in equal measure. No two people\nlook at one piece of art in the same way.\nWhat I\u2019m hoping is, as part of our effort\nto make Imperial a much more permeable institution, so it\u2019s not just engaging\nfor our students or staff, but also for the\nlocal community, alumni, and people\nfurther afield.\nQ: According to the Financial Review 2020-21 document, there was a\nstatement that Imperial \u201chas a high reliance on the Chinese students...make\nup 19.3% of the student population\u201d.\nIs there anything you would like to do\nbased on this?\nA: [Rather than] the goal of diversi-fying, I prefer to approach that from an\neducational point of view. We\u2019re seeking\nto create a learning community that is\nreflective of the world into which our\nstudentswillgraduateandliveandwork.\nMost of our graduates live and work\nin very diverse communities. Diversity\n[makes for] a better research environ-ment. As you know, China is a huge part\nof our world and we have many really\nsmart Chinese students. There are undoubtedly tensions between the China\nand the UK and US at the moment, but\nwehavetobecognizantofthosetensions\nand concerns.... We need to continue to\nbuild a magnet for the best Chinese research challenges.\nQ: Do you think there should be\nbetter provisions for students from\nhome countries?\nA: Widening participation was one of\nmy priorities in Bristol and Dublin, and\nI\u2019m very encouraged that it\u2019s on the radar of the management team and every\ndepartment that I visited. ...look at what\nthe numbers look like in university wide\nfaculties, departments, and can critically\nreview the programs we have in place already and ... if necessary, be willing to be\nquite radical in what we need to do.\nThe official unveiling ceremony for\nthe ALERT statue took place this\nMonday, 3rd October.

    "content": "\u201cThe function of a University is\nessentially to produce good\ncitizens, to give a complete and well-rounded-off education to its members\nand to encourage the pursuit of learning\nand research.\u201d - Adam Sedgwick,\nProfessorofZoologyatImperialCollege\n(1909-1913), paraphrasing Henry\nVIII on the opening of Trinity College\nCambridge, in a letter to Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Governing Body in 1910.\nSedgwick goes on to differentiate\nImperialCollegefromotheruniversities,\nstating that the purpose of the college,\naccording to its Charter, is \u201cto give the\nhighest specialised instruction and to\nprovide the fullest equipment for the\nmost advanced training and research\u2026\nespecially in relation to industry.\u201d This\nwas the founding principle of Imperial\nCollege, and in 1910 this applied fully -the idea behind the College\u2019s conception\nwas to produce individuals sufficiently\ntrainedtooperatemineselsewhereinthe\nempire.ThisiswhywearecalledImperial\nCollege, and not Imperial University.\nThis vision is very far from the\nImperial College we know today. Last\nyear we were ranked 6th\nbest university\nin the world by the QS rankings, in\nthe same field as Oxford, Cambridge\nand every other institution that teaches\nhumanities. Study at Imperial College is\nnot a specialisation that allows one to go\non to use the skills acquired to efficiently\nrun a diamond mine, and indeed, a small\nminority of graduates directly use the\nknowledge and skills they learned in\ntheir first job out of university. We are in\nevery way a normal university today: just\none that teaches no humanities at all.\nThe idea of the \u201cgentleman student\u201d\n(for they were almost always men) that\nwas expected at the time of the college\u2019s\nconception, when a tiny minority of\npeople attended university, is long dead.\nSuch learned men of the past typically\ncame from wealth and had spent their\nupbringing reading and learning a\nplethora of different subjects. It wasn\u2019t\nuncommon for a student to understand\nour Latin motto in the early 20th\ncentury.\nAgain, today is wildly different - I don\u2019t\nknow of any surveys that attempt to\nanswer this question, but from my\nexperienceintalkingtoImperialstudents,\nmost simply do not even read books.\nFocussing only on science and not\nat all on any other field makes one\nhighly specialised and likely extremely\nproficient at the discipline they are\ntrained in, but with nothing more than\ntheir natural capabilities to do anything\nelse. It makes one a well-sized and well-oiled cog in the machine. And I, as\nneither a Communist nor an ant, do\nnot want to be a cog in the machine.\nThe scientific method lays out the\nblueprint to discover exactly how things\nhappen, not why. I want to know why.\nThat being said, I do not suggest\nthat the College starts up a humanities\nfaculty. Though to my knowledge a\nsimilar move hasn\u2019t happened at another\nelite university, the process would\nprobably be akin to starting a new\ninstitution altogether. Pairing some of\nthe country\u2019s best STEM students with\nwhat would, at least initially, be some of\nthe country\u2019s least promising humanities\nstudents, is not much of a viable path.\nA merger with UCL, that would\nhave created a \u201csuper-university\u201d that\nwould \u201ceclipse Oxford and Cambridge\u201d,\nwas briefly mooted by the leaders of\nboth institutions in 2002 before being\nshelved.Besidesthemyriadprosandcons\nassociated with such a move, this would\nhave been a near perfect solution to the\nproblem at hand. However, not only did\nthe UCL merger not go ahead, but in\n2007 Imperial College seceded from the\nUniversity of London (UoL), further\nisolating itself from the other world\nleading institutions in the same city.\nAnd this is where we find ourselves\ntoday - an ivory tower of STEM with\nonly optional horizons courses as in\noutlet for any broader thinking. I don\u2019t\nthink there are any one move solutions,\nbut rejoining the UoL would be a start.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n6 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe College lets us down by shunning\nthe humanities\nSam Lovatt Managing Editor\nComment\n\n"

    "content": "Ifucked up. It turned out alright in the end, but I\nthought I was in for a depressing night at first. I\u2019ll\nstart from the beginning, way back in March. I was\non the night bus (already not a good start to a story\n\u2013 sidenote for the freshers reading, download CityMapper, it will save your life). I was heading home after hockey club night at Corsica. I lived near Putney\nBridge in second year, so this was about an hour and a\nbit journey, and I was bored, and I wanted to sleep. As\nI waited for the sweet sound of \u201cthe next stop is Fulham High Street/New Kings Road\u201d, I scrolled Twitter\nand saw Bleachers just announced a London show for\nthe first time in at least 5 years. Immediately, I scrambled to secure tickets to see Jack Antonoff\u2019s solo band\nwhentheycameacrossthepond.Itwas2am,notmany\npeople were up, I got tickets.\nFast forward to the rescheduled\ndate of the gig and I head to Shepherds\nBush Empire. There are two queues,\none for standing and one for seating. I\nhave never in my life purposefully (key\nword) booked seated tickets, so we\nhead to the standing queue. It is here I\nrealise I fucked up. My tickets are not\nstanding. They are Level 3 Seated/\nStanding. I saw the word \u201cstanding\u201d in\na daze on the bus and rushed to book it.\nAt this point, I am expecting the worst,\nhaving to sit all through my favourite\nband. I was wrong. I had a good night.\nExcitement bubbled during the\nlongest wait between support and headline I\u2019ve ever\nendured and then exploded as Antonoff took to\nthe stage to \u201891\u2019 and sat in front of an old CRT TV\nflashing in black, white, and green - as the lyrics to\nthe song literally state. As the opener of new album\nTake The Sadness Out Of Saturday Night, it contains\ngallons of references to previous album Gone Now\n(I\u2019ll spare you the in depth analysis of all the motifs\nscattered through both albums). This laidback version\nof \u201891\u2019 with only Antonoff singing and a soothing\nstring accompaniment led perfectly into the staggered\nentrancefor\u2018DreamOfMickeyMantle\u2019thatintroduced\neachpartofthebandinturn.I\u2019mrewatchingmyvideos\nof the night now and they\u2019re not providing much help\nbecause you can only hear me screaming along behind\nthe camera. After the openers of Gone Now and Take\nThe Sadness Out Of Saturday Night, the band settled\ninto their London home for the next two nights and\ndelivered one of the best performances I\u2019ve ever seen.\nThe set design had everyone on different levels, all\nlit by a small lamppost in the centre above Antonoff\u2019s\nTV. This let the main performers (Antonoff, his\nguitarist, and two saxophonists) run wild. In the\nchaotic breakdowns where they all showed off their\nmusical aptitude, the others cut random paths around\nthe mountainous stage, almost crashing into each\nother more than once. This all added to the infectious\nenergy that had erupted as soon as Antonoff took the\nstage. Although there are only around 8 members\nof the band (including 2 drummers), they manage\nto sound orchestral and gigantic when they want to.\nMost noticeably in the euphoric choruses of \u2018Let\u2019s Get\nMarried\u2019 and \u2018I Wanna Get Better\u2019, the band captured\nthe room\u2019s buzz and thrived on it.\nUsuallybehindthemixingdeck\nproducing pop star\u2019s megahits,\nAntonoff is just as comfortable\nbeing the star and commanding\nthe night. Throughout the night\nhe melts into different personas\nwhile always staying genuine,\nvisibly enjoying the gig as much as\neveryone watching. During \u2018Big\nLife\u2019 he\u2019sarockandrollstar,think\nLittle Richard or Buddy Holly,\nthen in \u2018Rollercoaster\u2019 you see him\nas the producing mastermind\nwho helps Lorde and Taylor Swift\nas he explains how the song came\ntogether from a single synth note. It\u2019s incredible to\nhave this glimpse into his process and how he builds\nup ideas and melodies. Finally, for \u2018Don\u2019t Take The\nMoney\u2019, he\u2019s a rock star again, shaking his knees like\nElvis and jumping up and down \u2013 an 80s movie would\nfreezeframe at this point with him air bound.\nAs well as the Bleachers hits, Antonoff added in a\nNew Jersey classic as a homage to his home state, Tom\nWaits\u2019 \u2018Jersey Girl\u2019, and also The Waterboys\u2019 timeless\n\u2018The Whole Of The Moon\u2019. I didn\u2019t know these tracks\nbeforethegigbutnowI\u2019msurethey\u2019llbeinmySpotify\nWrapped.\nOne day I will go into laborious, oppressive, tedious\ndetail about Gone Now: it\u2019s my favourite album and I\ncan\u2019t express how much I love it. I\u2019ve definitely crossed\nsomething off my bucket list seeing it performed live.\n15\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nView online here!\n\u2018This Is Why\u2019 by Paramore\nSingleoftheWeek\nAt the Top of the Bleachers (By\nMistake)\nWritten by Joe Riordan Music Editor\nGig Reviews\nToday in Music History\nA big day for TV appearances,\nOctober 7th saw: The Frank Sinitra\nShow debut in 1950; The Beatles\nappear on Shindig! in 1964; The\nRolling Stones appear on Saturday\nNight Live in\n1978!

Ms. Phillips is in excellent form, and\nthe musical backing along with the production by her husband T Bone Burnett brings\ntogether some unexpected combinations\nof sounds, sometimes simultaneously hinting at Beatles-era pop, old cabaret music from the 1930s, and film\nnoir or the novels of Raymond Chandler.\nImperial coordinates: when you\u2019re filled with an\ninexplicable loneliness at the\nthought of someone.\n10.\u2018BacktotheOldHouse\u2019\n- The Smiths\nIt\u2019s a melancholic song\nabout the bittersweetness of\npale distraught memories of\nyouth.

Also,\nI\u2019m a shameless pumpkin-spice latte bitch so the songs\nhave a Gilmore Girls vibe to it, I didn\u2019t want to create\na playlist based on a specific character from the show\n(because fuck Rory) so think of it as y/n in Stars Hollow - you walk through the cobbled streets of the town,\nhave a cup of coffee, and get to call Lorelai \u201cmommy\u201d\n(maybe it\u2019s just MY thing).\n1. \u2018Then She Appeared\u2019 - XTC\nMuch like the month of October, this song is crisp,\nmisty, and golden - with a sweet and heavy melody. Influenced by the Dukes of Stratosphear, Andy Patridge,\nXTC\u2019ssongwriterandleadvocalist,pennedthiswhimsical song which is praiseful of women. As October is\nan inherently gay month, it only made sense to start\nthis playlist with a song for my fellow sapphics, and anyone else who \u201cworships at the church of women\u201d.\nImperial coordinates: When you step into Central\nLibrary Caf\u00e9 in all black clothes and colourful socks\nand work up the nerve to ask the girl in front of you if\nshe listens to Girl in Red.\n2. \u2018They\u2019re in Love, Where am I?\u2019 - The Weepies,\nDeb Talan, Steve Tannen\nFrom an album with a solid collection of songs that\ndance around the joys and mysteries of dating and living with another person, \u2018They\u2019re in Love, Where am\nI?\u2019 leaps out as a brilliant slow song - mixing the unhappy lyrics with little acoustic touches like squeaky\nnylon guitar strings and an occasional glockenspiel riff\nto brighten it up.\nImperial coordinates: When your roommate falls\nin love with the boy-next door and you wistfully look\nat them holding hands in the kitchen.\n3. \u2018We\u2019re going to be Friends\u2019 - The White Stripes\nIthinkwehavetalkedmuchaboutthepainoflosing\na friend, but let\u2019s also talk about the joy of having one,\nwhich this song captures perfectly - the heartfelt lyrics evoking the simplicity and nostalgia of childhood\nfriendships.\nImperial coordinates:\nwhen you meet a lovely girl\nwith bright purple hair who\nspells her name with two e\u2019s\nand uses dance to distract\nher opponent in beer pong.\n4. \u2018Funny Little Frog\u2019Belle & Sebastian\n13 Songs to Listen to While Appearing Mysterious on Campus\nWritten by Ambika Bhardwaj Music Writer\nPOV: It\u2019s Autumn in Stars Hollow and you\u2019re on your way to Luke\u2019s\nFelix Recommends\nIt has been interesting only discovering Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s music over the past few years. With every subsequent\nrelease, being able to rediscover the Icelandic songwriter\u2019s music all over again in her brand new reincarnation\nhas been magnificent. With the release of Fossora I\u2019ve\nfinally gotten my chance to experience that rebirth in\nreal time, instead of the usual album-to-album picking\nand inclining towards familiar material. Fossora is indeed something new, even if the familiarities of Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s\nsongwriting can still be heard among the tooting of\nbass clarinets and sampled excerpts of herself, her son\nand her daughter singing. The \u201cweirdness\u201d that has become a staple of her music and persona since day one\nhas been dialled up to eleven, as she sings about her\nhomeland, her late mother, and her being a mother in\nthat famous all-over-the-place way that she has so distinctly mastered.\nThe first track and single of the album, \u2018Atopos\u2019 is\ndecidedly discordant with itself, with the only real\nconstant being the thumping rhythm underlying it as\nBj\u00f6rkconfrontstheperfectionistsinherlife:\u201cArethese\nnot just excuses to not connect?\u201d The song builds gradually towards Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s mantra: \u201cHope is a muscle that\nallows us to connect.\u201d You have to exercise it, you see,\notherwise those you might have found a \u201cresonance\u201d\nwith will be pushed away. In times of lockdowns and\nCOVID, we needed these connections more than ever,\nand while the pandemic struck the world, Bj\u00f6rk was\nalso slowly losing her mother to a failing heart. \u201cYou\ndid well,\u201d She reassures her mother in \u2018Sorrowful Soil\u2019\naccompanied by a chorus of other voices; this track was\nwrittenbeforeHildur\u2019spassing.Shecontemplateswhat\nit means to be a mother, both to her and to Hildur,\nwhile acknowledging her mother\u2019s \u201cself-sacrificial\u201d\nability to resist \u201cnihilism\u201d when raising Bj\u00f6rk.\nFollowing this is my favourite single, \u2018Ancestress\u2019.\nBj\u00f6rk and her son sing together, the former about\nher own mother, and the latter about Bj\u00f6rk herself. It\nweaves around long form (like the funeral procession\nin the music video, and another of my favourite Bj\u00f6rk\ntracks, \u2018Black Lake\u2019) as she comes to terms with her\nmother\u2019s passing, and the last years of her life. She describes the fierce resistance her mother showed, even\nto the doctors she \u201cdespised\u201d as they put a pacemaker\ninside her, and in her last years, how \u201cThe machine of\nher breathed all night.\u201d It\u2019s a beautiful musical obituary\n(Bj\u00f6rk calls it a matrimort) to her own late ancestress;\nit\u2019smoving,sad,butalsoshowshowmuchBj\u00f6rkappreciated and was inspired by Hildur\u2019s life of activism and\nselflessness. This is in stark contrast to the next main\ntrack of the album, that succeeds a brief Icelandic in-terlude. Bj\u00f6rk sings about her journey leaving a state\nof mind of victimhood with a demonic, dangerous and\nalmost evil timbre, which juxtaposes the saintly image\nshe describes that comes with playing the victim: \u201cVictimhood/Has a saintly glow/Holier than thou\u201d. The\nbasssynthsandclarinetssoundlikethey\u2019vebeenripped\nright out of a movie soundtrack for a villain\u2019s exposition scene. Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s\nvoice reverberates\non high, cutting\nthrough the chaos\nof the drums, clarinets and vocal samples that increase\nthroughout the sec-ondhalfofthetrack.\nMusically, it\u2019s quickly become one of my\nall-time favourite Bj\u00f6rk songs.\nAt this point we\u2019re only halfway through the album\n\u2014 there\u2019s so much more to unpack: the spritely, Utopia-like flutes of \u2018Allow\u2019, and the almost giddy feeling\n\u2018FungalCity\u2019(oneofthemanyBj\u00f6rksongsthatarepretty obviously about sex) which goes between tip-toeing\nand raving in matters of moments. Fossora has a fitting\nend, I think, in \u2018Her Mother\u2019s House\u2019. Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s daughter sings along with her: \u00cdsad\u00f3ra is her \u201chope-keeper\u201d,\nmuch like Bj\u00f6rk was for her own mother in \u2018Ancestress\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a song about the empty nest Bj\u00f6rk is left with now\nthat her children whom she has fiercely protected are\nnow all grown up. Bj\u00f6rk now only wishes to remind\nthem that her heart will always be with them: \u201cWhen\na mother\u2019s house/Has a room for each child/It\u2019s only\ndescribing/The interior of her heart\u201d.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 7TH OCTOBER 2022\n9\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nAgeing is usually defined as the gradual deterioration of the body over\ntime. However, a new definition of age-ing,asthelossoffunctionalityofthecell,\nthe basic unit that forms our bodies, is\ngaining more widespread acceptance in\nthe scientific community. Cells accumulate damage in their DNA, leading to a\nslow and gradual loss of function. There\narecertainexternalfactorssuchasdietor\nexposure to mutagens that can accelerate\nthisprocess,butcellswillmalfunctionin\nthe end regardless of our healthy habits,\nbecause the mechanisms that regulate\nDNA are imperfect. Ageing (and death)\nmay seem the unavoidable fate of every\nliving being on this planet. However, by\nusing a technique called cellular repro-gramming, we may be able to revert it.\nAgeing is mainly caused by DNA\ndamage, but DNA damage consists\nof more than just genetic mutations.\nEpigenetic factors are molecules that\nbind and interact with DNA to switch\non/off particular genes, regulating\nDNA expression. These factors may be\nas important \u2013 or even more important\nthan \u2013 mutations in the DNA itself.\nEach time an epigenetic factor works to\nactivate or silence a gene, it is displaced\nslightly from the original site of the\nDNA it was bound to, worsening its\nregulatory activity over time. All\nthe cells of a baby will have all the\nepigenetic factors in the right place\nand working properly, whereas almost\nall the cells of an older person will be\ndisplaced and act over the wrong gene.\nCellular reprogramming is one\npossible solution to this problem. It\nworks by returning normal cells into\ntheir earlier forms: stem cells. These\ncells are unique in that they do not \u201cage\u201d\nover time and are capable of specialising\nin different cells of the body from skin\ncells to neurons, which do age. The\nidea is to turn old cells into stem cells\nagain, which would divide into young\nspecialised cells, rejuvenating the\nbody and restoring its functionality.\nSurprisingly, a dramatic event like a\nsomatic cell backing into a stem cell does\nnot require complex genetic engineering\nor laborious techniques. In fact, we only\nneed to inject into the specialised cell\nfour molecules called Yamanaka factors:\nOct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc. These are\nepigenetic factors that inhibit somatic\ncell genes while activating stem cell\ngenes. Becoming a stem cell again means\nreturning to the starting point, so all the\nepigenetic factors previously displaced\ndue to ageing can return to their original\npositions. However, in becoming stem\ncells, cells lose their functionality and\nhence, need to specialise again. This is\none of the major challenges which has\nlimited the therapeutic applications of\ncellular reprogramming: we still do not\nknow how to convert these rendered\nstem cells into highly specialised cells\nsuch as cardiomyocytes or neurons.\nIn 2017, scientists succeeded in\ntransforming skin cells into fully\nfunctional neurons. The scientists\ndetermined the success of the\nreprogramming technique by applying\na voltage to the transformed skin cells,\nfinding that they reacted exactly as\nneurons should. However, they were\nnot able to tell if\nall the skin cells\nhad transformed\nfully into neuron\ncells. During such\na transformation,\nsome skin cells\nwill remain in\nintermediate states\nbetween neuron\nand skin cell, in\nlimbo \u2013 without\nany functionality.\nOthers will not\ndifferentiate at\nall. This happens\nbecause cells react\ndifferently to\nthe same stimuli\neven if they are of\nthe same type \u2013 a major limitation of\ncellular reprogramming for therapeutic\npurposes. Take for example, the\nreplacement of parts of a damaged\nbrain with neurons reprogrammed\nfrom skin cells. If any skin cells remain\nin intermediate states or untransformed\nin this scenario, they could be lethal.\nAt present, reprogramming all of\nthe body\u2019s cells to rejuvenate them\nis challenging, given that current\napproaches to deliver epigenetic\nfactors are not suitably advanced yet.\nApproachestodayuseengineeredviruses\nsuch as adenoviruses or retroviruses,\nbut creating viral vectors is expensive\nand time-consuming, limiting chances\nto go into the public market. Besides,\nviruses are foreign bodies and could\ncause excessive immune responses from\npatients, putting their lives at stake.\nThis has already happened in the past\nand scientists are therefore still sceptical\nof using viral vectors in clinics. In\nsummary, we face two major challenges\nin therapeutic cellular reprogramming:\n1) the development of a method to\nsuccessfully reprogramme all targeted\ncells and 2) the development of an\neffective method to deliver epigenetic\nfactors to the body. Any progress\ntowards overcoming these challenges\nwould represent a huge step towards\npreventingthedeteriorationofthebody.\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nScience\nCan we revert ageing?\nTech Writers Needed!\nInterested in writing about tech?

I sus-pect, given cost of living crisis, inflation,\nenergy, that we may see more students\nseeking support than in previous years.\nImperial has a Student Support Fund\nand hardship funding, and we\u2019ll be\nmonitoring that very carefully and mak-ingsurethatthefundisfitforpurposein\nterms of the criteria.\nQ: Would you be concerned about\nthe quality of research being affected\nbecause of postgraduates and undergraduates being priced out of living\nand working in London?\nA: What I do know is that one of the\ngreat draws of Imperial is not just its educational and research excellence, but\nactually its location in what I think is\nthe world\u2019s best city. When you look at\nit subjectively, [we] still are attracting really fantastic students. If it becomes an\nobstacle to recruitment and our reten-tion, then we will ask \u2018what should we\nbe doing\u2019.\nQ; Follow-up: I know of PhD students who say that they are \u201cdoing the\nentire PhD over Teams because I can\u2019t\nafford to travel in\u201d. This could disproportionately affect students from a\nwidening participation background.\nA: It\u2019s definitely something to look\nat. Having said that, what COVID has\nenabled us to do is fast forward in terms\nof our digital capabilities... PhD experience or indeed the general experience is\nthat the multimodal, I think, that works\nreally well - that it\u2019s in person combined\nwith digital educational research... certainly as I tour departments, see if that\ncomes up as an issue.\nQ: Would you want to have more\ncasual meeting with students beyond,\nfor example, targeted focus groups?\nA: I think there is a place for both,\nand getting a combination of the formal\nandinformalissomethingIenjoy,soyou\nwillseemewanderingoncampus.Ihope\nI\u2019m viewed as approachable and visible.\nPresident Brady was visible at Welcome\nFair earlier this week, as he visited various\nbooths.\nQ: Six weeks in, is there any specific\nwork you\u2019ve started on improving or\nare working with people on?\nA: The biggest is the engagement pro-cess. I\u2019ve already probably met several\nhundred people across the institution\nand leadership at all levels. I have already\nmet the student union, and have started\ndepartmental visits. I\u2019m hoping to visit\nall our departments, meeting not just\ndepartmental management teams, but\nearly career researchers, and bespoke sessions with students. I\u2019ve just completed\nthe residential with my own team and it\nwasfantastictogettoknowthemaspeo-ple and hear their ambitions and dreams\nfor Imperial, as well as what\u2019s worrying\nthem for the year ahead.\nQ: Were there any issues raised at\nthe residential that you previously\nhadn\u2019t been aware of?\nA: No, the way I approached that is\nsay \u201clook, I want to hear you as a team\u201d,\nand asked: What do you think Imperial\nwill look like in 10 to 20 years? How will\nthis be? Who are we looking to compete\nwith? Who are we looking to partner\nwith? And equally, what are you worried\nabout? How we\u2019ve got to work together\nto solve those issues.\nFor example, student identity. It\u2019s very\nmuch an engagement thing and then\nwhat we will do is then start to roll that\nout across the institution with a view to\nthen developing a new strategic plan got\nImprtial that tries to get that balance\nright between the short term, medium\nterm, and the long term now. The quality of conversation was fantastic. I\u2019ve inherited a brilliant management team.\nI was equally impressed by student\nleaders, by their ambition for the insti-tution. So the last thing that I should do\nis come in and say on day one I want to\nchange.\nAs the interview came to a close, President Brady also mentioned that he \u201cenjoyed our chat\u201d, and would like to \u201cdo it\nthrough the year\u201d.\nIf there is something that you wish to\nknow more about concerning this inter-view, do email felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\u2019VE INHERITED\nA BRILLIANT\nMANAGEMENT\nTEAM.\n\u201c\nto working with Professor Brady and the\nrest of the College in making sure that\nthe right policies and procedures are\nimplemented effectively.\u201d\nOn Monday, President Brady sent\nan email to all staff and students, titled\n\u201cStarting the new term\u201d, in which\nhe reminded staff and students that\n\u201csupport is available \u2026 and that it is a\nsign of strength, not weakness, to ask\nfor help\u201d, reassuring them. They also\nexpressed concern about potential\nrepercussions, joking that they might\nnot be around at the College next week.\nThey have been employed at the College\nfor 25 years.\nIn the open letter, the staff member\nquoted a Felix article from 8th\nOctober 2021 (c. 1778) in which Felix\nsummarised then-President-elect Hugh\nBrady\u2019s remarks on a Technical Healing\npodcastabouttheunusuallyhighsuicide\nrate at University of Bristol in the years\n2016-18, while he was Vice-Chancellor.\nThe QC Investigation Report was the\nsubjectofanFOIrequest,andaredacted\nversion was published in February 2022\nafter the ICO commission ruled that it\nwas in the public interest to do so. This\nruled that then-President Alice Gast had\nbullied one person, and with then-CFO\nMuir Sanderson, had contributed to\ncreating a hostile working environment.\nMuir Sanderson resigned shortly after\nthe publishing of the report, and Alice\nGast continued until the end of her\ntenure in July 2022.\nThe open letter alleges that \u201cthe\nImperial Community were rightly\nconcerned, upset and angered by what\nhad happened\u201d, adding that the \u201creport\nshowed that procedures were not\nfollowed\u201d, citing the comments of sexual\nand racist nature quoted in the report.\nAccording to the staff member, this\nreport was the \u201cconsequence of not\nadhering to College policies, procedures\nand processes\u201d, and they expressed\nconcern over the mental and physical\nimpact on the victims.

Oralead Pharma CEO Dr. Dou is a\nmember of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great\nBritain and the American Pharmacists Association.\nHe obtained his PhD from UCL before joining\nShenzhen Capital Group as an investment manager\nand later worked at Intract Pharma, specialising in the\noral delivery of complex proteins, before establishing\nOralead Pharma in 2022. The company has already\nreceived an angel investment of several million pounds\nandiscurrentlyworkingonpipelinesoforallydelivered\nbiologics, or specifically, polypeptide drugs. The team\nis expected to submit an Investigational New Drug\nApplication in 2023.\nBefore we dive into details, what are biologics?\nCommon drugs can be roughly categorised into\ntwo types: chemical drugs and biologics, or\nbiopharmaceutical drugs. Chemical drugs have\nsmall particles and well-defined structures. They are\ntypically manufactured through chemical synthesis by\ncombining specific chemical ingredients in an ordered\nprocess, which allows for large volume production.\nIn comparison, biologics are large, complex molecules\nmanufactured in a living system such as humans,\nmicroorganisms, plants or animal cells. Therefore, the\nproduction process is significantly more sophisticated\nandisextremelysensitivetophysicalconditions,which\nbring difficulties to scaling up, ensuring purity and\nmaintaining batch-to-batch equivalence.\nOral delivery is best\nThe oral route is the most common form of drug\nadministration. Currently, oral formulations represent\nabout 90% market share among all pharmaceuticals;\n84% of the best-selling pharmaceutical products are\norally administered; its market size is valued at $98.3\nbillion, with a predicted 6% compound annual growth\nrate (2020-2027).\nSpecifically for biologics, Oralead chooses to focus on\nthe oral route because, for many biologics, injection\nmay cause an immune response. For other biologics,\nsuch as peptide drugs (the most typical drug of this\nkindisinsulin),patientsmayneedfrequentandregular\ninjections, which are painful and inconvenient.\nWhat are the obstacles?\nThe history of polypeptide drugs dates back to 1921\nwhen the first product of its kind, insulin, was acquired\nfrom a non-human source. In 2016, Novo Nortis\ndropped its needle-free oral insulin research line,\nwhich discouraged many. However, in 2019, the first\nThe solutions: existing and prospective\nTo reach their target tissue, drugs need to pass through\nthe stomach and duodenum (a part of the intestine),\nwhose enzymes and acidic environment will likely\ndestroythefragilebiologicsandreducetheirabsorption\nrate. Factors that govern oral drug absorption include\ndrug solubility, mucosal permeability, and stability in\nthe gastrointestinal tract environment. Overcoming\nthese obstacles may result in higher bioavailability (the\nability of a drug to be absorbed and used by the body).\nPharmaceutical technologies that aim to enhance\noral drug absorption include nanocarriers, micelles,\ncyclodextrins and lipid-based carriers.\noral insulin, \u201csemaglutide\u201d was approved by the FDA,\nopening the door to a new age of oral biologics. Some\nproblemspersist:1.highcosts;oralinsulincosts$26per\nday, twice the cost of injection. 2. Low bioavailability\n3. Inconvenience; oral insulin needs to be taken every\nday. With these shortcomings, oral delivery of insulin\nmay not be able to build significant depand when still\nin competition with the injection method.\nWhileexistingproductshaveabioavailabilityofaround\n1%,OraleadPharmaaimstouseitspatentedtechnology\nto achieve a bioavailability of 26% - 26x higher than\nexisting products - and reduce the frequency of dosing\nto once per week. The company uses an unreactive\nexcipient substance to enhance permeability and uses\noligopeptides to increase stability.\nOverall,althoughtheoralbiologicsdeliveryindustryis\ninitsearlystageofdevelopment,andhasmanyobstacles\nto overcome, it is a multi-billion dollar market with\npotential to revolutionise existing medicine.\nEditor\u2019s note\nWelcome,mydearreaders!Felixhasrecentlycreated\na new column called \u2018Business\u2019, which will feature\nentrepreneurial stories, industry insights, and expert\ninterviews.

    "content": "Take the sworn-enemies-to-lovers romance of The\nNight Circus, add generous dashes of fantastical\ntime-travel, and finally, season with the heartbreaking-ly precious prose of On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous\nand what\u2019s left is a deliciously intricate cocktail of a\nnovella. This Is How You Lose the Time War is another fantastic addition to the criminally under-appreci-ated but \u2013 personally \u2013 much adored epistolary genre.\nCo-authored by Max Gladstone and Amal El-Mohtar,\nthis queer love story is the deserved winner of both the\nHugo and Nebula awards for \u2018Best Novella of 2020\u2019.\nAt its centre, the plot of This Is How You Lose the\nTime War appears simple. Following rival agents,\nthe reader is taken on a vivid time-travelling, multi-verse-treading adventure with every intricate detail\nexquisitely portrayed. Sights, sounds, tastes, and textures are all strongly evoked as we jump from historical\nfantasy settings to futuristic technological dystopias,\nflying through the full breadth of science fiction. Our\nprotagonists, Red and Blue, are elite, powerful feminine figures within their respective agencies and have\nbeen born and bred to turn the tides of the titular\nwar in their favour. Blue works for Garden, a faction\nthat weaponises nature, sowing seeds of poison into\nthe fields of history in the hope they will bear future\nfruit. Whilst Red represents the mechanised might of\nAgency \u2013 the opposing force to Garden \u2013 which uses\namorphous inorganic robotics to fight for their fu-ture. And so, at polar ends of the war, Red and Blue,\nthe best agents of their respective sides, are inevitably thrust into battles, hatred, and undying rivalry.\nBut life is never this simple.\nThe story starts with Red. We see her standing, tri-umphant, in the aftermath of a battle, but although\nsuccessful in this particular skirmish, something\nfeels different. She senses an unusual presence, a letter from the enemy, crafted for Red, written by Blue.\nDespite her better judgement, Red reads it and thus\nbegins their secret correspondence. As years, decades\nand centuries pass by, we follow Red and Blue, letter\nafter letter, as their relationship evolves from tentative to fully-fledged romance. But how can they possibly overcome their differences? How can they find\nlove in the midst of waging war? And ultimately,\nwhat are they prepared to sacrifice to find each other?\nNow, despite how beautiful this sounds, there\nare two caveats that might be irksome for certain readers: the time travel and the prose.\nThe time-travel aspect is dealt with tastefully. Absent are the numerous, constrictive rules that govern\ntime-travel in books such as Before the Coffee Gets Cold\nor the mind-bendingly confusing plots birthed by rampant time-travel movies such as Christopher Nolan\u2019s\nTenet. Gladstone and El-Mohtar use time-travel in its\npurest sense, as a mode of transport, facilitating Red\nand Blue to traverse the past, present, and future as a\nlandscape. Journeying from one stunning location to\nthe next, the reader is allowed to appreciate the impossible complexity of a time-war in all its glory. Additionally, by following Red and Blue as they chase each other\nacross eons, leaving letters in their wake, the reader sees\nthe growth of their relationship organically, witnessing\nhow curiosity becomes friendship, how fundamental\ndifferences are overcome and how pride and enmity are swallowed\nby romance. Although time-trav-el does feature\nheavily within the\nstory, sci-fi fans\nlooking for a \u2018hard\u2019\ntime-travel narrative diving deep\ninto the nitty-grit-ty of chrono kinetic mechanics might be disappointed.\nA review of this novel would not be complete\nwithout mention of its prose. As purple as it is beau-tiful, the ornate, and at times poetic, writing style of\nGladstone and El-Mohtar may not be to everyone\u2019s\ntaste. Littered with inter-textual references, most\nbook lovers will adore the Easter eggs woven into the\nbook, spun with fun, intelligent originality. Gently\nled through whimsical settings, readers will be awestruck by the countless inventive ways the authors\nare able to describe two simple colours. This Is How\nYou Lose the Time War is flowery prose at its finest.\nSo, if you\u2019re in the mood for a delightfully written\nsapphic love story, following two elite female agents on\nopposite sides of a time war, This Is How You Lose the\nTime War is the perfect read for you. Exploring themes\nof friendship, desire, and timeless love, this novella is\noneyouwilldevourwhilesavouringeverysinglethread.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n20\nThis Is How You Lose the Time War\nBook Review\nIvin Jose Books Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\u201c\nA DELICIOUSLY\nINTRICATE\nCOCKTAIL OF A\nNOVELLA\nAs Fresher\u2019s week is upon us.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n16 Music.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nMUSIC\n\u201cAnd as the sun, the moon, and the stars appear in\nwater, so writings, sermons, virtues, and certain human\nactions take form for me and gleam.\u201d \u2013 Hildegard von\nBingen\nIn the modern age we are spoilt for choice for which\nmusic we listen to and we always have a piece of mu-sicwhichfitsoureverymood,oureverymovementand\nour every moment. You often find that such music was\nwritten with these aspects in mind: Mahler writing his\nmusic in great sadness, Shostakovich writing in anger\nand protest of an oppressive regime, Dvorak writing in\nawe at the great beauty of the American landscape.\nThese grand concepts and emotions thus create\neven grander and more emotional music and we find\nourselveslostintoaworldofsymphoniesandfantasies.\nThus, it can seem that listening to the plainchants and\nmonophony (single melodic passages) of the mediaeval era seems like a waste of time due to its simplicity\nwhen compared with the music of the titans of the 19th\nand 20th centuries. Yet, we forget that for someone like\nHildegardvonBingen,Plainchantandmonophonyoffered a way to express what would\u2019ve been the grandest\nconcept of all, the nature of God.\nHildegard was born in c.1098 and from a young age\nhad experienced visions of God and the Virgin Mary\nas written in her Vita (autobiography). These visions\nwould lead to Hildegard becoming an Abbess, a mystic and an author of a large musical output. Her music\noften accompanied larger mystical works such as her\nbook \u2018Scivias\u2019 which features the musical segment \u2018The\nSymphony of Heaven\u2019.\nIt is clear to see, therefore, that the music which\nHildegard was attempting to create\nnot only offered a\nway to describe and\nexpose people to the\nwords and meanings\nof God, but also was\nitself a manifestation of God and that universe itself is the \u2018Symphony\nof Heaven\u2019; a powerful allegory and this idea of the\nuniverse being the music of God has often been used\nas a thematic device in the literature of C.S Lewis and\nJ.R.R Tolkien.\nNo other work exemplifies Hildegard\u2019s beliefs of\nmusic being the manifestation of God than her great\nwork, \u2018Ordo Virtutum\u2019, a large-scale monophonic work\nwritten as a morality play. Hildegard herself received\nnomusicaltrainingatallbutwasdescribedasaclairau-dient and thus many believed that her music - as well as\nher written works - was inspired directly by God.\nThe play itself is a tale of how a soul yeaning for\nheaven abandons its patience and is swayed by the\nDevil in the\nfirst act, but\nlearns over\nthe course\nof several\nacts how the\nHe a v e n l y\nVirtues are\na means to\nascend into\nheaven and\nto not be\nswayed by\nthe Devil. It\nis most likely that the\nwork was to\nbe performed by the nuns in her convent as the significant majority of parts are for women, with a few male\nparts taking the roles of patriarchs and the Devil.\nIt is in this work that we see the extent of her musical talent. Most Gregorian Plainchant is very simple\nindeed and only requires a narrow range of the voice to\nsuccessfully sing. Equally, since most prayers are quite\nverbose words, often many syllables would be incorporated onto one or two notes. An example would be\nthis famous chant, \u2018Ubi Caritas\u2019. It can be seen that the\nrange of the chant only extends to a perfect 4th and syllables occupy no more than two notes at a time.\nHildegard\u2019s chants by comparison break this norm\nby having many of the melodic lines be far reaching\nand wide in tonality, very melismatic and possessing\nboth angular and scalic passages which give her music\ndiversity and character. This passage is taken from \u2018O\nIgnee spiritus\u2019 and possesses a vocal range of a major\n9th.\nOften Hildegard uses melody as a method of character building in how she specifically caters each line\nto fit the voice singing; this is seen in \u2018Ordo Virtutum\u2019.\nThe personifications of Humility and Charity are\nquite reserved in their melodies and sung with grace\nand tranquillity whereas the personification of Heavenly Victory is bold, loud and quick paced. The Soul,\nthe main protagonist of the moral, is light and jubilant\nwith long skipping passages and angular melodies and\nthe Devil does not sing but merely grunts and shouts;\nthe Devil of course cannot participate or hope to join\nin the singing as Hildegard states, \u201c\u2026he cannot produce divine harmony\u201d. Thus, Hildegard has created a\ntale that is shaped and made more real because of the\nmusicshehasmade;ifhergiftofdivineclairaudienceis\nto be believed, it is also shaped and made real by God.\nHildegard von Bingen\u2019s legacy is still celebrated to-day; her mysticism and writings have been widely appreciated by the Catholic Church and in 2012 she was\nmade a Saint and Doctor of the Church. Not only that,\nmusicians continue to hold her in high regard for the\nwork she did in advancing western music as a whole.\nAninvaluablelessonthatshetaughtusisthatmusicoffers us a way to express our emotions and our spiritual-ity. Regardless of whether you are someone who holds\nspiritual beliefs, one cannot deny that music possesses\nan inexplicable power which allows us to move others\nand also to move ourselves.\nI urge you all to listen to the album of \u2018Ordo Virtutum\u2019 as interpreted by the choral society Ars Choralis\nCoeln. As well as faithfully interpreting the original\nmonophonicworks,somemovementshaveoverlapped\nmonophonic chants to create a polyphonic texture and\nalso use authentic instrumentation to add flavour to\nthe music. It is a bold but strikingly beautiful interpretation of Hildegard\u2019s music.\nMysticism, Melody and Monophony\nWritten by Gilbert Jackson Music Writer\nAn Introduction to the Spirituality and Musicality of Hildegard von Bingen\nFelix Recommends\n\n"
