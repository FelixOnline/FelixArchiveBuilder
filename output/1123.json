    "content": "22 Arts 26 October 1998\nJOHN SINGER SARGENT\nTate Gallery\nT he career of John Singer Sargent\n(1856 - 1925) was a blend of triumphant success and titillating\nscandal. As a student of the Ecole\nNationale des Beaux-Arts In Paris, his\npromising debut\nwas marred by the\nindignation surrounding Madame\nX( pictured left), a daring portrait\nexhibited at the\nannual 1884 Salon.\nThe public was outraged at the extent\nof female flesh\nrevealed by the\nlow-cut black\nevening gown (by\ntoday's standards,\nthe neckline is disappointingly con-serva ti ve). More\nshocking still, her\nslinky golden dress-strap, casually sliding down her\nshoulder, was denounced as sexually\nprovocative (heaven forbid!). Under pressure from his critics, Sargent actually\nreadjusted the position of the offending\nstrap, thus partly appeasing the fragile\nsensibilities of a19 th century audience.\nAlthough sometimes dismissed as a cosmopolitan social-climber, the intense\npublic attention he received only served\nto enhance his appeal amongst clients.\nAppointed to the Royal Academy in 1897,\nSargent soon\nbecame remarkably\nfashionable, painting members of\nthe distinguished\nnobility and international elite. This\ncollection of 150\npaintings forms a major retrospective,\nlater touring the\nmuseums of Washington and Boston\n(Sargent was of\nAmerican national-it y). In the context\nof contemporary\nBritish art, his work\nwas regarded as\nexperimental and\navant-garde. A friend of Claude Monet, he contributed\nto the introduction of Impressionism in\nEngland, adopting similar elements of\nstyle and brushwork technique. Yet Sargent's spirit remains firmly ingrained in\nthe traditional and romantic.\nJaded by the demands of socialite\ncommissions, Sargent devoted his attention to landscapes, figure studies and\nmural design projects. Then in 1918, he\nwas officially requested by the British\nWar Memorials Commitee to record an\nimage of the Great\nWar for a proposed\nHall of Remembrance. He travelled\nto the French front\nand witnessed the\nhorrific casualties of\nconflict. The result\nwas the impressive\nGassed, which measures over six metres\nwide and usually\nhangs in the Imperial\nWar Museum (no th ing to do with IC!).\nThe scene depicts a crowd of blindfolded\nsoldiers, their eyesight damaged during a mustard gas\nattack. This tragic painting is an overwhelmingly distressing image of suffer-ing, especially powerful when contrasted\nwith Sargent's typical social portraits featuring vivid colours, lavish costumes and\ndazzling interiors.\nSargent was accused of \"glossing\nover social realities, sacrificing psychological depth to superficial brilliance\", an\nunfair reproach considering the fact that\ncommissioned portraits, by definition,\nsupposedly flatter\nthe sitter. However Sargent's pictures are not\nsimply decorative;\nhe approaches\nevery subject with\nsubtle perce p tion, capturing\neach pose or attitude with delicate\ncharm, confirming his unrivalled\nposition as the\nultimate Edwardian portraitist.\nHelena\nUntil 17th January\nNearest tube: Pimlico\nAdmission: \u00a36, concessions \u00a34\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.40 pm PICASSO'S LADIES: JEWELLERY BY WENDY RAMSHAW\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nPablo Picasso had an eye for the\nladies. Wives, mistresses and\nfriends have been depicted in\nhis paintings. The identity of his subjects\nmay seem inconsequential to us, but for\nPicasso, each woman had an allure,\nwhich led to the intense emotion\nexpressed in his work. It was this sentiment which drove Wendy Ramshaw to\ncreate a collection of jewellery designed\nfor the women in his life. The exhibition\nfeatures 66 sets of jewellery, each one\ninspired by a particular painting, which is\ndisplayed alongside her work as a print.\nPicasso's style of combining abstraction with pattern has been a useful tool\nin the design of dynamic and detailed fin-e ry. In some of her pieces, Ramshaw has\nimitated the colour and form of the original paintings. The neck piece associated\nwith The RockinQ Chair resembles a rocker with the outline of a seated\nwoman's body. A set of large, clear beads\nmimics the translucence of Standing\nWoman with thin red and yellow lines\nthat define the painting. Other pieces of\nRamshaw's work simply develop\nPicasso's theme, such as the accompanying jewellery for a scene portraying a woman at the beach drying her feet,\nwhich is a necklace of polished pebbles.\nRamshaw is an established artist\nwhose early work had an aboriginal influence, and this is still apparent in this collection from the shapes and designs\nwhich she regularly employs. She chose\nto work with a range of media for Ihe\nproject, but included only hard materials\nas a reflection on the profundity of\nPicasso's feeling.\nSome of her pieces seem a little\nover-elaborate and I had to fight against\nmy aversion to the Jewellery to appreciate the meaning behind it. However,\nother sets were very beautiful and could\nbe highly valued outside the boundaries\nset by the exhibition. Ramshaw often\nuses the materials to add expression to\nPicasso's two dimensions. Sadness, for\ninstance, is visualise d as a cascade of\ntear-shaped jewels and the two rings,\ndescribing The Kiss, were cut to form lips\nwith a smouldering stone set in each.\nOne of the most striking pieces of\nthe exhibition was a set of two virtually\nidentical rings, one set with moonstones\nand the other left as empty gold sur-rounds. This was associated with the Portrait of Olga, whose head and shoulders\nwere painted in soft pastel shades\nwhereas her crossed arms were left as a pencil sketch.\ntv en the stands for the rings and\ncombs are carefully handcrafted,\nalthough in some cases I found myself\nadmiring these more than the actual\nexhibits! Yet this meticulous attention to\ndetail characterises Ramshaw's wish to\ndo Picasso justice. For one of the final\npieces of the collection, Ramshaw has\nchosen Women Ironing. Picasso's sympathy for the subject is shown In the neutral tones and the weary female face,\nrevealing the tedium of her labour. In a similarly generous gesture, Ramshaw\noffers her a string of glittering jewels in\ngold. The question is, if Picasso were\nalive today, would he present these gifts \u2022\nto his treasured ladies?\nDemelza .\nUntil 15th February\nAdmission: \u00a35, FREE for students\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.30 pm( Mondays from!2pm) "

As I wandered along, I noticed that\nnestled between the electrical stores\nwas an 'outlet' of the Church of Scientology.\nHaving been aware of the organisation for many years, and being rather\ninquisitive, I sheepishly entered. I simply\nwanted to find out what was on offer,\nwhat was different about them and what\ntheir agenda was. After all, the organisation boasts such members as John Travolta and Tom Cruise.\nThe 'outlet' resembled a cafe in\nsome respects. Practically as soon as I walked in I was invited to take a personality test, which I duly did. I ticked\nupwards of about sixty boxes designed\nto delve into my innermost psyche. I was then interviewed about the results,\nwhich seemed to indicate a certain lack\nof personality. This is the complete\nantithesis to what people, including\nmyself, would say, although I am an IC\nstudent. Admittedly I didn't fill out the\nform as carefully as I might. However I did notice that many of the questions\nwere repeated in\nslightly different\nguises - for what purpose I am not quite\nsure.\nMy interviewer\ntried to wrench as\nmuch sensitive information out of me as\npossible; I retorted\nwith whatever\nentered my head at\nthe time. She thought\nthat a process called\nauditing would be to\nmy benefit. Apparently this auditing is\nrather like psychotherapy, but the subject\nis connected to an 'E meter' which is\nsupposed to point out problematic points\nin the life of those being audited, for all\nI know they were using it to determine\n...human problems\nstem from \"lingering\nspirits of an extraterrestrial people massacred by their ruler,\nXenu, over 75 million\nyears ago.\"\nmy financial status.\nWe continued conversing for around\nthirty minutes while the interviewer\nattempted to gain more and more information. She was\nextremely keen to\nfind out my darkest\nsecrets and, when I would not divulge\nthem, became\nincreasingly per sua sive. Tired of the probing questions, I asked\nabout the organ is a tion, its beliefs, its\nfounder and its basis.\nI was given a whirlwind description of\nthe Church - so brief\nthat I knew little more afterwards than\nwhen I walked in the door. Apparently\nScientologists believe that all human\nproblems stem from \"lingering spirits of\nan extraterrestrial people massacred by\ntheir ruler, Xenu, over 75 million years\nago.\" These spirits attach themselves by\n\"clusters\" to individuals in the contemporary world, causing spiritual harm and\nnegatively influencing the lives of their\nhosts,- it makes me look at flu in a completely different way.\nI was then invited to buy some\nleaflets at a cost of \u00a34 each. I declined,\nexplaining that I was a poor student,\nwhilst hiding my mobile phone. I explained that I hadn't bought my VCR\nyet, but promised to return...

Douglas\nGraham's resignation from the post of\nVice President (Education and Welfare),\nreported in last week's letters page, has\nleft the RCSU with nine vacant positions,\nas well as several empty seats on the\nCommittee.\nVP (Finance) William Bentley said\nthat most vacancies resulted from officers needing to devote more time to\ntheir academic studies. There seems to\nbe a general lack of interest in the running of the RCSU on the part of most of\nits members, which has made the officers' jobs harder, increasing the pressure on their time. These difficulties\nseem to mirror those of the ICU, who are\nhaving trouble filling the post of Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies). The\nprospects for the RCSU seem gloomy If\nby David Roberts\nThe fate of Medical School entries into\nsporting leagues and cups hangs on\nMonday's meeting of the British Universities Sport Association (BUSA) Council.\nAlthough last week's meeting of University of London Union (ULU) Council\nvoted to allow medical students to be\nable to pick whether to play for their\nown side or for their \"parent institution\",\nthis conflicts with current BUSA policy.\nConsequently, the prospect of continually changing rules promises to produce\na situation described as \"a complete\nmess\" by one senior figure.\nIf the BUSA meeting rules against\nthe ULU decision, then the prospect of\nteams being forced to change between\nevery game looms large. Indeed suspicion is growing amongst senior sports\nofficers that BUSA may decide to simplify\nthe entire issue by forcing all institutions\nto entire as a single unit. In the words of\none senior official \"BUSA could legitimately turn round and tell us we must\nhave single entry now\".\nAt present, the discussion revolves\na paid Sabbatical post cannot be filled\nbecause of a lack of interest in student\npolitics.\nNomination papers for the posts of\nPresident, VP (E&W), Union General\nMeeting Chair, Honourary Secretary, Welfare Officer, Web Editor, Archivist and\naround the exact interpretation of a system known as \"hybrid entry\". This was\nintroduced for the first time this season,\nto allow institutions currently undergoing\nmergers with medical schools (Imperial,\nUCL, King's and QMW) to enter a mixture\nof separate medic and non-medic teams\nand joint institution-wide sides. For Imperial, this means that College wide teams\nenter all sports except Rugby, Football\nand Hockey, where separate medic and\nnon-medic sides exist.\nAt the ULU meeting, the ULU VicePresident (Sports), Nick Dunnet, suggested that the proposal to allow\nstudents the right to pick which team to\nplay for was only a \"clarification\" of the\nhybrid entry system adopted by BUSA.\nHowever, minutes of the BUSA Executive\nmeeting held on the 6th of March this\nyear clearly state that entries will be\ndecided on \"a sport specific basis\". In\nother words, ICSM students can only\nenter as part of a College wide team if\nno medical team exists. This directly contradicts the motion passed by ULU Council (which applies lo UL competitions\nonly).\nPublications Officer are up in the RCSU\noffice on Unwin Road. There is also a vacancy for a Biology Departmental Representative. In the meantime, Mr Bentley\nand VP (Clubs and Entertainments) Bob\nWalker are filling the role of acting President.\nAs a result, Monday evening's meeting of BUSA Council is being asked to\nadopt the ULU interpretation of the\nhybrid system. Consequently, three realistic possible outcomes exist: BUSA\nrefuse to set the precedent of changing\neligibility rules in mid-season, forcing the\nsports teams to field different teams for\ndifferent competitions - and in all likelihood forcing ULU to back down; BUSA\naccept the new \"interpretation\" of hybrid\nentry, and the merger process speeds\nup; BUSA complain about the inherent\nproblems of checking up on the correct\nenforcement of the system, and force\nsingle entry now (rather than in three\nyears time, as originally forecast).\nAlthough this may all seem hideously\ncomplex, it is a real cause for concern\namongst senior sources, and has major\nimplications for Imperial's chances in\ncompetitive sport this season. Whatever\ndecision is reached, ICU Rugby, football\nand Hockey teams will not be merging\nthis year, so if BUSA accept the ULU\ndecision, we stand to loose out, with\nUCL (whose teams will merge) the largest\nbeneficiaries. However, if BUSA refuse,\nkeeping a check on who is allowed to\nplay for what team will become a night-mare, and all hell could break loose.\nEither way, troubled times would seem\nto be ahead.\nIf you have any views on the situ a tion, then please get in contact with\nyour club captain.\n26 October 1998\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nPhotographic Editor: William Lorenz\nMusic Editors: Jason Ramanalhan and\nDenis Patrickson\nNews Editors: Andy Ofori and Joel\n> Lewis\nI ilm Editor David Roberts\nGames Editor; Gary Smith\nArts Editor: Il elena Cochcme\nLiterary Editor: Kent Yip\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nFreeze on\nFees\nby Gareth Morgan\nEver since the Dearing Report and the\nintroduction of tuition fees for most UK\nstudents, several universities have been\ncontemplating charging extra 'top up1 fees. These would be paid to the university on top of existing fees, and fig-ute s of up to \u00a3400 per year have been\nmentioned. Particularly interested have\nbeen the 'Russell Group', a club of about\ntwenty prominent institutions including\nIC. The Oxbridge colleges have a particular interest in this since there have\nbeen threats to the \u00a32500 they receive\nfrom the Government for each student\non top of usual tuition costs.\nLSE have been contemplating the\nintroduction of top up fees, a move\nwhich may prompt the other Russell\nGroup universities to do likewise. However, ICU President Dave Hellard recently\nmet with the Rector to discuss the new\nfees. The Rector stated, and confirmed\nin writing, that IC was not considering\nimplementing top up fees, and this\nwould not be affected by other institutions' actions or the forthcoming Government review of the definition fees.\nDave Hellard said that \"Top up fees\nwould have a disastrous effect on the\naccessibility to the best education for\npoorer students. It would create a two-tier system based on wealth and not\nintelligence\". He added that the agreement with the Rector was a decisive\nstep in the right d it ect ion, especially\ngiven IC's influential position within the\nRussell Group.\nMed School Sport\nHangs In Balance\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at MCP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16 - 16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040- 0711\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial Coilege Union Publication Board.

    "content": "20\nReviews Film\nA Perfect Murder * \u2022 * v* Starring : Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen\nDirector: Andrew Davis\n26 October 1998\nF or no readily discern able reason,\nremaking old Hitchcock films is\nvery much in vogue at present.\nWitness Good Will Hunting director Gus\nVan Sant's current project - a shot by\nshot copy of Psycho. Consequently, A Perfect Murder lands on our screens as\na reasonably direct reworking of Il itch' s Dial M For Murder.\nGwyneth Paltrow eases comfortably\ninto the footsteps of Grace Kelly, demonstrating with ease the same kind of ethereal grace that made her predecessor\nfamous. Meanwhile, Michael Douglas\nrevisits his more vila nous days as her\nhusband (originally played by Ray Milland). He happily retreads the roles that\nmade him famous in the late eighties, in\nfilms like Wall Street, Fatal Attraction and\nBasic Instinct, utilising his full range of evil\ngrimaces, sneers and stares. All of which\nprobably gives away the fact that Douglas\nis playing the bad guy and Paltrow his put\nupon wife.\nDouglas is a multi-millionaire (owner\nof one of the nicest apartments ever\ncreated) who is understandably miffed\nwhen he discovers that his wife is having\nan affair. As well as being stunningly\nGwyneth Paltrow. Married to Michael Douglas? I don't think so.\nattractive, Paltrow, whose one failing is\na tendency to become very obviously\nuncomfortable whenever the romance\nmoves above a PG rating, is heir to a massive fortune. Consequently, when Douglas fears his business is going down the\ndrain, he decides to bump her off.\nSo far, so what. I low ever, as those\nwho have seen the original will be well\naware, his next move is far less orthodox.\nI le offers her lover - struggling artist\nMortensen - half-a million dollars to do\nhis dirty work for him. Odd to say the\nleast.\nAt this point, director Davis (whose\nprevious work includes Fhe Fugitive)\nsteps up a gear and does Hitchcock\nproud. The action scenes, which to Davis'\ncredit avoid the seemingly mandatory\ncar chases and explosions, still have you\nfearing for Paltrow, even if they do lack\nthe edge-of-the-seat tension of the orig-in al. And at least for those who haven't seen the original, the plot twists will keep\nyou interested - even if much of the\naction does seem fairly predictable.\nSadly, however, when the pace\nslows the movie falls back into a flat,\ntranslucent, one dimensional story. You\nrealise that the idiotic affluence of these\npeople (even Mortensen) is so far\nremoved from the everyday world that it\npushes the film towards fantasy. Moreover, whilst the psychological games provide a break from normal big-bucks\nthrillers, the denouement is never really\nin doubt, and Douglas' hamming constantly eschews reality in favour of enter-tain ment. Indeed, top class entertainment it\nundoubtedly is, thanks to good lead performances and a treatment which avoids\nbecoming reverential. Il itch cock it certainly isn't but so what. Judge it on Its\nmerits, not on its predecessor, and you'll\nbe pleasantly surprised. Q Dave\nI Want You * \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Rachel Weisz, Alessandro Nivolo, Labina Mitevska, Luka Petrusic\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom\nRachel Welsz.- a bright spark In a gloomy tale.\nGritty, depressing, obsessive,\nbleak, tinged with grey....sound\narthouse enough yet? Well, if\narthouse means low budget, British,\nstory driven and very good, then arthouse it certainly is. Once in a while,\nhowever, you have to forget such tri-fles, and just watch films on merit. So\nit's low budget - so what.\nFar more biz are is the fact that /\nWant You counts amongst its stars two\nyoung former-Yugoslavians, whose previous work has solely concentrated on\nthe Croatian stage. This may become\nslightly more obvious when you realise\nthat director Winterbottom met them\nwhilst filming his last movie, Welcome to\nSarajevo. This also explains the decision\nto use acclaimed Yugoslav cinematographer Slawomir Idziak. I le brings with him\nhis trademark strange camera effects\nand filtering techniques, in an attempt to\ncapture the action through fourteen year\nold Petruslc's eyes.\nDespite all this, however, the central\nrole still belongs to British born Weisz\n(Stealing Beauty, Chain Reaction, Fhe\nLand Girls). She plays Il elen, the centre\nof a vicious love triangle that also\nincludes fourteen year old mute Petrusic\nand old flame Nivolo. Naturally, all have\nhidden secrets and sad tales to tell, and\nover the course of ninety minutes, they\nare slowly and convincingly revealed.\nPetrusic hasn't spoken for years, and\nInstead spends his time listening in on\nother people's lives, with an impressive\narray of recording and surveillance equip-ment. Consequently, he becomes\nembroiled in Nivolo's obsession with\nWeisz, and learns the reason for Martin's eight year imprisonment.\nIf all this sounds very vague, then\nthat's because giving away any more\nwould destroy the plot. Suffice to say,\neveryone's clearly setting themselves up\nfor a big fall when the finale arrives - and\nwhen it arrives, it certainly won'tdi sap point.\nObviously, / Want You is not going to\nsuit all tastes, and will be either too force-ful, too depressing or just too weird for\na vast number of people. I low ever, if\nyou're prepared to accept a little bit of arthouse in your diet then this will prove a powerful, thought provoking tale. By\nturns dark, seductive, hilariously funny,\nbrutally violent and mind numbing ly grim, it's brilliantly executed by both the\nwell known and obscure faces amongst\nthe cast. A fine ensemble production,\nfrom both cast and crew, that's well\nworth a look. Q Dave\n\n"

Pictured\nhere without Butler\nS ince his critically acclaimed collaboration with Bernard Butler\nsome years ago David McAlmont\nhas been pretty quiet. A Little\nCommunication is his debut solo\nalbum. Mostly co-written with pianists\nPeter Gordeno, Guy Davies and guitarist Graham Kearns. If you are familiar\nwith McAlmont's previous work then\nyou will immediately recognise the\nvoice hewn from the halos of angels.\nThis refreshing album features a brand\nof blues soul heavily influenced by\nAmerican artists like Marvin Gaye.\nOther influences on this work include\nGospel music and Frank Sinatra.\nOpening with the very soulful and\nreally rather good Lose My Faith which\nclocks in at over 7 minutes this is a touch\nlong but retains your interest throughout.\nOther high points in the album are the\nquite brilliant A Little Communication,\n(from which the album takes its name)\nand current single Honey. If the entire\nalbum was of a similar quality then this\ncould have been seminal. The Gospel\ninfluenced Sorry, possibly the most\nupbeat of all the tracks, illustrates a tendency to go a bit over the top in pro-duct ion. There's the attitude, 'Let's chuck\nin a trumpet solo to disguise how\nmediocre this Is sounding.' The Train, the\nonly track solely credited to McAlmont,\nis possibly the worst on the album suggesting that he still needs another musician with him for guidance in finding\nthose better songs. (Although Bernard\nButler's album would suggest otherwise.)\nIn an attempt to break away from formulaic blues, some of the tracks are\nmore experimental or minimalist in feel.\nIt's Enough, Love And Madness and AFter\nYouth seem to be works in progress\nrather than finished tracks. Uses of drum\nmachines and samples don't really add\nanything to the album and could be said\nto be taking something away. Yet\ndespite this McAlmont should gain some\ncredit for attempting to inject life into\nwhat could have been just another Boyz2-Men album. If you really feel in the\nmood for blues soul then your best bet\nwould be to search through Marvin\nGaye's back catalogue for true classics\nlike For You My Dear. CI\nCraig\nW hat do you get if you mix U2\nwith Madonna and a couple\nof expensive samplers and\ncomputers? A bloody awful noise\nabout which your parents would revel\nin moaning about, saying such things\nas 'It's such a racket,' and 'In my day\nmusic had a tune that you could sing\nto,' is probably the best bet. I low ever, by some feat of amazing computer\nknowledge, Tin Star have done just that\nand created what could be one of the\nbest albums from a new band that I have heard since The Propellerheads'\nalbum Decksanddrumsandrockandroll.\nMellow, invigorating and sometimes\ndownright groovy, their music style is\ntruly confusing. Some tracks, such as\nWonderful World, verge almost on very\nmellow drum and bass, fast Machine is\ndefinitely big beat but the opening track,\n/ lead, is just plain alternative indie. Not\nvery confusing you may be thinking but\nwhat makes them stick out from other\nbands you hear is the beauty and intricacies of the songs. David Tomlinson's vocals flow somewhat darkly around the\nroom, sounding surprisingly like Bono\nwithout the massive singing range, mingling with wonderful electronic sounds\nand Tim Bricheno's sparse guitar. The\neffect is not unlike a deeper version of\nMadonna's Ray of Light or perhaps POP\nby U2 without the guitars. The standout\ntrack on the whole of The Thrill Kisser is\nPicture of a Girl, which is very trip-hop\nand good to lie back to and be a love\npuppy.\nThe only criticism that I cou id lay\nupon Tin Star is that the sound can\nbecome repetitive and that they do lack\na bit of a sense of humour. Also, there's a necessity to stop the tracks just meandering into each other.\nNever the less, if you like this kind of\nmusic, as I do, this CD will be in your\nplayer for long periods of time as you lay\nback in a darkened room, entranced by\nthe dark melodies and big beat bass\nsections, this album is brilliant Jet down\nonly by a few hashed up, boring tracks\nThe band is refreshingly new and I hope\nthey become as big as they deserve.\nOr will you all just go out and buy the\nnext sodding Ibiza collection? A big phat\nfour stars, and tin ones at that. CI\nEddie\nSingles\nBeastie Boys - BodyMovin'\nA classic Beastie's track. Full of funky and fun flav as. Definitely one to get you m ov in' l! Badly Drawn Boy - EP3\nThe first track, My Friend Cubilas, is a brilliant mellow\ntrip hop tune. Unfortunately the rest of the EP is spoilt\nby Badly Drawn Boy's badly sung voice.\nFreekspert - Gas Mark 5\nThrash metal/rap cross over group. If you like lots of\nmen screaming down a microphone and guitar\nscreeches this is definitely one to buy.\nTowaTel- GBI\nKylie Minogue features on this bizarre single about printing type-faces. After a great Dee-lite sampled intro the\nsingle plummets down hill. Unfortunately the remixer s can't do anything with it either.\nCornelius - Star Fruits Surf Rider\nJapanese electro-indie is a very strange combination.\nBut suitably good for Damon Albarn (Blur) to remix it.\nWorth a listen.\nGrandaddy - AM 180\nMellow little ditty, sounding very much Weezer or\nPUSA. Typical American College indie sound Pleasant\nenough.\nGarbage - Special\nYou know who they are, probably know what the song\nsounds like and almost certainly saw Shirley Manson in\na short skirt singing it on Top of the Pops.\n3 Colours Red - Paralyse EP\nQuite an aggressive and dark sounding EP with heavy\nguitars and drums. None of the tracks are outstanding\nbut none are too bad either.\nThe Supernatural - Sheffield Song\nA whine y little pop song about love. But it is pretty\ncatchy and the lyrics are funny. A sure fire chart hit.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Jurassic 5 - Concrete Schoolyard\nExcellent mellow hip-hop from this San Franciscan\ngroup. Concrete Schoolyard is one of the best singles\ntaken from the superb J5 fP. CI\nRamzi\n\n"

By now, it's known in kindergarten\nthat Il eaton and Rotheray are the most successful song writing partnership\nsince two blok es in the sixties and they deliver some humorous and some\nserious output here on Quench. Yes. there was a bit of production work by former\nI louse martin Fat Boy Norman but those expecting a radical change of direction\nand drum loops searing in and out of the dual vocals of Paul Il eaton and\nJacqueline Abbott arc mistaken. Quench is unmistakably The Beautiful South.\nIntelligent lyrics, 'Aren'tI clever?' lyrics and sometimes inane sound bites all figure\namidst the mixture of catchy snatches and slower slumbering s. Those disillusioned\nwith Blue is the Colour will see it as a return to form.\nThe sexy Perfect 10 has already drummed itself into people's minds with its\nfunky Il ammon d intro and dubious, or perhaps even obvious, sexual references:\n'When he's at my gate with a big fat eight, you wanna see the smile on my face.'\nMind you, this is Just baby talk considering it came from the same creative source\nthat conjured up 'Don't marry her, fuck me.' The experiment in melancholy, how-ever, is over. Quench is fuller and more rounded than Blue is the Colour. There are\nplenty more singles that could be released. Album opener, I low Long's a Tear Take\nto Dry? is upbeat while The Lure of the Sea sees a lull in the run-a long rhythm. Bit)\nCoin will probably be re-recorded and also performed a capella to great success;\nbasically the one where people go, 'Wow. they can sing. And really well too!'\nQuench's Essential Choon. though, is Window Shopping for Blinds. Powerful\nin its musical content without going over the top, it has all the necessary ingredients for a popular song: interesting but not outright attention grabbing verses,\nmelodic pre-choruses and finally a chorus that can't seem to escape the sonic compartment of your brain. The opening lyric, 'One day I'm loaded, next day I'm broke.\nSpent all my money on whisky and coke,' is typical of the now expected pub talk\ncontent of the album, took What I Found in my Beer is probably the best example\nof this style of colloquial lyricism.\nSo, it's better than Blue is the Colour and Quench is, as stated previously but\nworth emphasising again, a return to form. In a musical marketplace where everyone is trying to grab a piece of sound history in generating a new genre or new\nstyle, Quench is reassuringly old-fashioned in its simplicity. 'South fans but probably not the 'South themselves would argue that this is a new musical direction but\nit's not. It's excellent pop music with a touch of blues and soul. It's created by experts\nand it's built to last. The Beautiful South. God bless 'em. CI\nDennis\nDUB PISTOLS\nPoint Blank j Err album cover\nPoint Blank does exactly what it\nsays: shoots you with experimental beats that lie on the boundaries of hip-hop, funk, jazz and rag gae. All of these influences appear on\nalmost every track, and they do not dis-appoint. When you hit play on your CD\nplayer you'll think there's an electrical\nfault with the way the intro uses strung-out keyboards and struggling beats. You\nquickly calm down, though, with the\nsoft rapping and then they drop some\nreal catchy loops. If Unique Freak was\nreleased as a single it would definitely\nget a 'This recording contains material\nwhich some may find offensive' stamp,\nbut don't worry, because it won't! The second track is nothing outstanding but the Pistols continue to keep\nyou attentive with the fresh beats and\nloops they always use. This is typical of\nthe entire album and the Dub Pistols\nstyle. Cyclone sounds so familiar (I'm convinced it samples something but\ncan't put my finger on it - maybe It\nappeared in a TV ad' or something?).\nThe rag gae beats and simplistic rapping\nare so fresh but it's the bass-line which\ngives me deja vu. Putting your CD player\non 'Repeat 1' at this point would be\nacceptable. You would be excused for\nbreaking wind when Ghetto rolls: the\nphat test bass just force it upon you. Raggae-tipped vocals keep the bass in check.\nAlthough it gets repetitive after about two\nminutes, who cares, this is just so rough!\nI didn't even realise we came out of\nFowerblock Trash and went into FVesfway. Once again a phat bass-line on\nboth. The experimental beats are accompanied by some raw sampling.\nTowerblock Trash features cool semi-breaks and trumpets (I guess) bring us\nback to an electronic voice demanding\n'money'. Just as you feel the repetition\non Westway, the progression begins.\nExcellent keyboards and harder beats,\nand then the bass gets so deep that the\nwhole place starts vibrating! The keyboards get progressively frantic and the\ngeneral tempo seems to rise.\nThere's a backing vocalist who drops\na few lines on several of the tracks and\ntotally annoys the fuck out of me. I le\nappears on track seven as well. Why?the main vocalist performs more than\nadequately on his own.\nI he title track relies more on the\nelectronics. Still, there's always something new on each track. If you get this\nfar you have become an expert in the\nDub Pistols sound. The rest of the tracks\nsound much the same but the sound\ngets slightly more ambient as we\nprogress, the electro becomes more frequent and we eventually bang our heads\nto hard-core techno, d Abu\n\n"

    "content": "26 October 1998 Arts 23\nCHRIS OFILI\nSerpentine Gallery, Hyde Park\nAs a scientist, the idea of talking to\nother scientists about art scared\nme... It scared me a lot! To help\novercome my initial lack of confidence,\nI phoned and enlisted the help of my\nbest friend who rather conveniently happens to be a student at the London Institute (Art College to you and II). She kindly\noffered to come with me, boyfriend in\ntow, to investigate Chris Ofill's solo exhibition. It's easy to hate art simply because\nyou don't want to try to understand it. It's even easier to hate modern art because\nit looks so ridiculously basic. But when\nyou actually stop and try to analyse the\nidea behind a piece of work, you'll soon\nsee it's not as simple as it at first\nappeared. As a rather cynical biologist, I always cringe when I hear that modern\nart doesn't need any one particular\nmeaning or that it can be interpreted as\nthe individual sees fit. This to me, in\nmost cases, is a cop-out and allows artists\nto escape from trying to convey a personal thought or opinion in pictorial or\nsculptural form. Art should have something to say, and if it doesn't, then there's no point to it.\nNow, if I were an honest person, I would say that I went along to the exhibition with an open mind. However, a tad\nmore realistically, I'd say that I was\nexpecting It to be rubbish. Well, \"was it?\"\nI hear you cry: the answer is I'm not\nsure. The first thing that greeted me on\nwalking into a large white room was a piece entitled Shithead '93. this little\ngem of a sculpture was composed of a lump of elephant dung mixed with resin\nand decorated with Chris Ofili's own hair.\nPicture it yourself,\na lovely image\nI'm sure you'll\nagree! Despite\nmaking me laugh\na lot, this made\nme realise that\nOfili, like Damien\nHirst, enjoys to\nshock people\nwith the strange\nand obscure.\nThe elephant\ndung was a feature found ir\nnearly all of the\npieces in the\nexhibition.\nIndeed, most of\nthe large collages\nwere propped up\non two large\nmounds of the\nstuff! This, according to the insane\nart critic who conducted a tour of the\ngallery, was done so that the \"3-D quality of the work could be fully appreciated\". Hmmnn... Nearly all the reviews on\nChris Ofili have concentrated solely on\nthe elephant dung (which is probably, in\nmy opinion, why he used it in the first\nplace). Not wishing to follow suit, I have\ndecided not to do this, but I will tell you\nthat anyone who brings tons of dung\nheaps back from a painting scholarship\nin Zimbabwe and then endeavours to\n? display them\non a market\nstall has to be...\nWell, you judge\nfor yourself.\nChris Ofili's other influences include\nprostitutes,\npimps, drug\ndealers, hiphop and b lax plo it ation films\nfrom the 70s. He seems very\nkeen to appeal\nto the young\nand \"trendy\"\nwith his use of\n70s and porno\nimagery. Virtually every piece\nhas someone\nwith a massive\nAfro hidden in\nit somewhere and you find yourself constantly looking for the bad, naughty or\ndisgusting ideas and images - at least, I did!\nOne of the aspects of Ofili's work\nl hal did appeal to me was the fact that\nhis work was very detailed. Many of his\npsychedelic collages revealed more on\nThe Adoration of Captain Shithead and the\nLegend of the Black Stars, 1998\ncloser inspection than they did at first\nglance. My favourite piece was, rather\nboringly perhaps, a pencil drawing of\nhundreds of little faces arranges in circles,\nentitled Untitled '96. I think the main reason for this was because of its intricacy\nand the fact that it was a welcome break\nfrom resin, acrylic, oil, paper and dung\ncollages. Ofili's use of tiny dots was effective in providing dense colour and shape\nto his subjects. His inspiration for this\ncame from the Matapos cave paintings\nin Zimbabwe.\nChris Ofili displayed work at the controversial Sensations exhibition at the\nRoyal Academy last year. Born in Manchester, he studied at the Chelsea School\nof Art and the Royal College of Art. He\nhas now been shortlisted for the 1998\nTurner Prize. In conclusion, I'd recommend seeing the exhibition; It's free for\na start, and it only takes five minutes to\nwalk up Exhibition Road to reach the\ngallery. You probably won't like it at first\nbut you'll end up talking about it to your\nfriends for ages afterwards - if only\nbecause of those stupid elephant dung\nmounds.\nIngrid\nUntil 1st November\nNearest tube: you've got to be joking!\nAdmission: FREE\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm PHOTOGRAPHY: AN INDEPENDENT ART\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nT his exhibition is an introductory\noverview of the Victoria and Albert\nMuseum's collection ol photographs, which\noverall assembles\nsome i OO.

As would \u00a7\nbe expected from |\nan exhibition in the\nV&A, the quality of the pictures is excel-lent. Everything, from the simple, powerful black and white images like Bayer's Metamorphosis, where the whole image\nis in stark focus, to Hockney's boldly\ncoloured Photography's Dead Long Live\nPainting, is well thought out and skillfully\nas s s executed.

    "content": "26 October 1998 Columns\nThought for the Day\nHalloween\nT his may be the first Halloween on\nwhich you get children coming to\nyour door and asking for Mars\nbars before stealing your trousers. Well,\nthat's what they do where I come from,\nanyway. As far as I am concerned, the\nscariest imaginable event on October\n31 is a load of drunk 12-year olds arriving\n\"...Jhe-de vii is hdi rr king of Zippo lighters will\nalert vo u to the fact\nX. on your doorstep and clam our ing to be\nfed chocolate (just for that sugar-rush). If\nthey are refused, they will disappear,\nreturning, as if by magic, at the witching\nhour; the devilish clinking of Zippo\nlighters will alert you to the fact that your\nbins are on fire. Oh yes, the real zombies\nwalk amongst us every day.\nThis scenario, let's face it, is far more\ndisturbing than even the best pumpkin\nlanterns. As Steve Punt once put it: \"It's a large root vegetable with a candle in it.\nNew underpants for me, Mum.\"\nHalloween is a corruption of All Hallows' Eve,\nthe day before the Christian festival of All Saints'\nDay. The traditions of Halloween are believed to\nhave been inherited from\nthe Druids. Both the Celts\nand the Druids considered\nthis day to be of spiritual\nsignificance; the Celts\nplaced Halloween at the\nend of their year. Finally,\nthe Romans introduced\nthe features of one of their\nharvest festivals into Halloween when they were\non their world tour in 55\nBC.\nThis still does not answer\nthe question: why do\nmothers let their kids jaunt\nmerrily round the darkened neighbourhood, wearing provocative elf costumes, and requesting\nsweeties? Was that the Romans' idea, or\nExperience the unbridled\nfury Imparted by my\nwicked, demonic powers!\nNu- hah hah hah hah\nha a a ah!a drug-induced Druidicism?\nWhile we're on the subject of\nwitches and drugs together, I must draw\nyour attention to a memorable s cries which was\nshown over the summer\non Channel 4. The s cries was entitled Sacred Weeds,\nand showed the investigation of a group of scientists, anthropologists and\n\" - ;:-,.< ,'i jr nil !\\|.(\u00bb, I!'\", \u2022 ing volunteers with legal\ndrugs and then observing\nthe effects. Henbane was\none drug administered in\nthese tests, which some\nbelieve was used by the\nwitches found commonly\nin folklore. If this s cries is\nrepeated, I strongly suggest you watch at least the\nfirst programme; it will be\nworth it just to see one volunteer climbing a tree to\npotentially fatal heights,\nwhile high as a kite on fly agaric mush-rooms, as the scientists calmly take notes.\nWe can thus sec how the media\nthrives on Halloween, of course; any\nexcuse for a bit of seasonal variation is\ngladly accepted [and accepted especially\nby me]. It's still a fun idea, but I think children these days are far more interested\nin the perversely explosive thrills of 5\nNovember than in bobbing apples. The\nhorror film industry loves this day like no\ndfr T TD Tn giri ree Jo potenti c mushrooms.,\"\nother; but that, as wc all know, is a well-worn, hackneyed, and generally low-quality route.\nHalloween, then. Be it wizard, or be\nit wash-out? Like so many of the pleasures of childhood, the appeal vanishes\nas you get older. Plus forgetting to buy\nMars bars will probably trip me up.\nThe Simpsons episode was good,\nthough. Ali Campbell\nMedicine Matters\nNick Newton T here arc some who might say\nthat Sherfield is the last bastion of\nthe empire, and filled with people\nwho want nothing less than complete\nworld domination. I really do not know\nthe personalities in Sherfield well enough\nto decide whether they are suffering\nfrom megalomaniac al delusions of\ngrandeur or whether they just want to\nmake the world a better place. However, I do feel that if the attitude they like\nto project concerning their approach to\nundergraduates and general student\nfacilities is accurate then pity the poor\nfools who allow themselves to be swallowed up by the Sherfield behemoth.\nThis side of IC has been revealed to\nme in several ways, culminating in the\nmeeting in Gladys' where the medics\nwere receiving Instruction in the financial\nregulations governing ICU. The exact\ndetails of the controversy are not especially relevant but the meeting did highlight certain beliefs held by Sherfield that\nare worrying because of their implications for the student body.\nImperial College is prepared to\nspend \u00a3125 000 000 (please note the\nnumber of noughts) on a building on\nwhich they had agreed to spend \u00a360\n000 000. I wish I knew their bank man-ager. On top of this, Sherfield is going to\nspend an estimated \u00a3110 000 on a few\nflowers to make the building look pretty.\nAgain, I ask, where do they bank and can\n1 open an account there? Thinking about\nit a little further, I don't want an account\nwith a bank that allows its customers to\noverspend to the tune of \u00a365 000 000 but\nrather I would like a job working for the\ncompany that managed to get Sherfield\nto cough up that sort of cash. Maybe ICU\nshould try to head hunt them for the\nposition of DP C&S? The previous paragraph was just a prelude to explaining about the problem\nof the lack of transport that ICU is able\nto provide to its members because IC\ndoes not give them enough money. IC\nis happy to bask in the reflected glory of\nIC medics winning the rugby UH cup\nand of IC cricket winning the UL championship but are they going lo lift a finger or allocate one penny of funds to\nenable these achievements to happen?\nIC seem to have no conception of the\nfact that if you ally yourself (I 'll never be\nmerged) with such a widespread campus\nnetwork then your students arc necessarily going to spread out, as are the\nfacilities. Perhaps this is another part of\ntheir plot to kill the will and spirit of the\nstudents so that they can cut ICU's budget even further.\nWhat these developments mean is\nthat the issue of student politics is no\nlonger about personal ambition, CV\npoints or argumentative ness. It is about\nwhether you as an individual want to play\nrugby, hockey or football, whether you\nwant to go sailing or SCUBA diving or flying or just sit and watch a new-release\nmovie with the cinema club. All these\nactivities, indeed just about everything\nthat you as students do are funded to\nsome extent by a body of policy makers\nwho treat you as a loss leader and who\ncould not really care less about you. In\nthe long run, so long as we do nothing\nto interrupt the flow of research money\nthat floods into the IC coffers, Sherfield\nwill do the bare minimum to keep us\nhappy while relying on their reputation\nfor academic excellence to keep recruit-ing. Unfortunately this is unlikely to\nchange anytime soon because IC seems\nto have found an unending supply of students who do have and do not appear\nto want a life outside of their work. I only\nhope that the medics do not get corrupted by this attitude because medicine is hard enough without losing a social life as well.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters 2 6 October 1998\nA World of Terrorists\nDear Felix,\nIf Mr Stringer might be persuaded to\npause in his breathless moral outrage for\njust a moment ('An Alternative to Air\nStrikes?', Felix 1122), he might perhaps\nrealise that Israel is hardly alone in acting\nthe way that it does, unfortunate though\nthis maybe. In fact, I can think of a much\ncloser country where \"torture of prison-ers\", \"imprisonments without trial\" and\n\"forbidding people to travel freely within\ntheir own country\" have been the norm.\nStumped? Try adding \"massive military\noccupation\", \"massacres of unarmed\ndemonstrators\" and \"multitudes of miscarriages of justice\". I would add \"lock-ing civilians into their own homes\" except\nthat it doesn't begin with an M. Astute\nreaders will of course have already\ndivined that I speak of none other than\nthe British government in Northern Ireland. Glass houses?\nNaturally the actions of Israel,\nHamas, the RUG and the IRA are all\ndeplorable. The point is simply that\nIsrael, like Britain, has motivations for its\ndeplorable behaviour, be they justified or\nnot - if Mr Stringer doubts this, he may\nwish to consider where he was when the\nAldwych bus bomb exploded. To believe\nin a simplistic strategy of going-home-and-sorting-it-all-out, while ignoring the\nproblem of addressing these motivations\n(such as Israel's very real security con-cern s), is naivet e of the highest order.\nTheodore Hong (Computing PC)\nCCU - Strike Two\nWell, since my letter on the subject of\nchange in the CCUs I have been inundated with comments. Most (80%+)\nhave been along the lines of \"great let-ter\" or \"about time someone said that...\"\nOthers have not been so good. To any\nof those who I upset, I apologise, however my views on Union politics still\nstand.\nIt is no good having the CCUs run by\na select few forming a quasi members\nonly club, making it hard for non friends\nof officers to get involved. The age of\npeople coming into influential roles without any background training must end in\nthis academic ycat. I am concerned not\nonly with the welfare aspects of my CCU\nbut I want to try and help all future students of all CCUs.\nNext year we will have a new sabbatical officer (s abb) in charge of welfare\nin the Union, he/she should have control\nover the way in which Departmental and\nWelfare Officers do their jobs. The dep-reps should have a good team of year\nreps below him/her and should then\nreport back to the s abb. The same rules\nneed to apply for this as they do to\nfinance. All new welfare officers and\ndep-reps should be given training in welfare and basic techniques needed to\ncomplete their tasks properly.\nIf ICU is now in charge of Welfare,\nwhat is left for the CCUs? I am not calling for the abolition of these. Tradition\ndoes have its place at college. They\nshould be made up of the heads of the\ndepartmental societies and be concerned solely with providing events and\na certain amount of support for their\nstudents. This is because there are different needs from different places - Engineers need advice on industrial\nplacements, Physicists need to learn how\nto have fun etc.\nI am currently working on a paper to put\nto ICU council later in the academic year,\noutlining the changes that I feel need to\nbe made. If you have any comments\nthen e mail me at\ndouglas.graham@ic.ac.uk\nDouglas Graham (Physics UGII)\nChange the Music!\nI am writing to complain about the music\nplayed in the Union, particularly on\nWednesday nights. Often on Wednesday\nI go to the Union for a few drinks with\nmy mates. Every week, without fail [the\nEnts & Marketing Manager] or one of his\nclan churns out the same old Brit Pop\nIndy shite. I normally don't mind if the\nmusic being played is not to my taste but\nwhen I hear the same stuff week in,\nweek out, I wonder if the music is played\nfor our benefit, or to keep the Dj's happy?\nNot only is it the same style of music, but\nthe same tunes are played every week.\nThere are plenty of good Dj's at the\nUnion's disposal who can play a massive\nvariety of music. Personally I would like\nto here more good (particularly non-commercial) electronic music. I know\nmany people that feel the same way\nwho simply avoid the Union because it\ndoes not cater for them. I am not asking\nfor Wednesday night to be turned into\nindustrial Acid-Techo night, but simply\nthat more variety is played. There is plenty\non electronic music out there that many\npeople enjoy.\nI know that letters with the same\npoint have been written before and in\nthe past [the Ents & Marketing Manager]\nhas responded by saying that 'We play\nthe music because people want to here\nit. The dance floor is always full between\n1T30 and 1:00'. Well, firstly the dance\nfloor Is always full because most people\nby that stage are quite pissed and would\ndance whatever music was played. Secondly, the fact that people like what you\nplay is no reason not to have variation.\nPlease, please, please give some of the\nother Dj's the 11:30- 1:00 slot, let's have\nsome variation, you can try to please\neveryone. Anyone reading this letter who\nagrees with me do something, speak to\nthe Ents Manager, or reply to this letter.\nTim Wright (Computing 4)\nEnts Replies...\nFirst things first, my personal musical\ntaste has no effect on the ents musical\npolicy at all (except if I'm Djingl). I won't even get into the 'musical tastes' a rgu ment, though it is nice to see that in your\nopinion anyone in the Union dancing\nhas to be pissed.\nIf you check round what the other\nUnions in London put on themselves\n(as opposed to their clubs and societies)\nI think you'll find we actually put on a diverse range of events.\nlor instance on Saturday nights we\nrun a range of pre-club nights including\n'the electric cafe' which, with incredible\nsynchronicity, happens to focus entirely\non eclectic electronica, 'Tha Bomb1\n, a hip hop, funk and soul night and 'Bubble\n& Squeak which will be playing a mix of\nelectronic dance.\nThat's on top of the chill out room\nwe run every Wednesday and Friday,\nwhich anyone can tell you is certainly\ndiverse as we have an 'anything goes'\nmusical policy up there. And I haven't even mentioned the four alternating\nclub nights we run on a Friday. I hope\nI 've answered the points raised; if you\ndon't like a Wednesday night, then why\nnot try one of the others? I'm fairly confident that you'd like at least one of\nthem.\nEnts & Marketing Manager\nMedical Indoctrination\nDear Sir.\nIf ec iI must complain about the appal-ing attitudes senior medics have regarding the non-medic students of IC. In\nconversation with a first year medic\nrecently it emerged that he was actively\nencouraged by senior medics and ICSM\nUnion officials to avoid social ising with\nstudents of other subjects.\nWhilst I am not surprised by the us-and-them attitude of the relics left over\nfrom the old system, indoctrinating the\nnew students to disp is e other students is\nclearly not on. I can only hope that the\nfirst year medics learn to live with us\nduring their time at the BMS, away from\nthe hate-mongers.\nJames Browning (Physics II)\nA Word from Estates...\nAs a proud member of the Estates Division, a former warden, ICU Hon Life\nmember and manager of the car-park, I must comment on the planter. Setting\naside the VFM question, there is a good\nenvironmental case to be made.\nNext month, 2 Jags will flesh-out the\ntax implications of those driving to work\nin London. The College may well be\nobliged to charge staff and students.\nThe demand for spaces may well\ndrop below the supply, and if it doesn't, there are plans to build an attractive (if\nSir Norman can't do it, no-one can carpark on Dalby Court to satisfy the\ndemand.\nParking is a lucrative business, and I enjoy maxim ising the profit with minimum disruption to the core activity of IC.\nHowever, parking is not a core activity of\nIC. If we lose research income (and we\nhave) because our campus is unsightly,\nsurely we are obliged to act. How we act\nis a matter for consideration.\nVFM does not stand for Vegetation\nFor Ma'am.\nKen Young\nCharing Cross not a Loss\nFollowing your article above I would like\nto clarity some of the facts that seem to\nhave been distorted over time.\n1.

Yes, it's that time of year when many people throughout the world\ncelebrate Halloween. Most just readily accept the occasion for a party and an excuse to be\nmentally obliterated, to aggravate neighbours and play silly pranks. But how many people\nknow exactly what Halloween is? Halloween has rather a convoluted history and understandably one which people often ignore.\nIn essence Halloween is about the 'other side', not ITV, but a night in which evil spirits\nsupposedly roam the earth. Perhaps today the original meaning of Halloween is lost, but retailers arc ti. il lost and Halloween is increasingly becoming a commercialised affair - just look\nal ll ii win ol\\ ol products on offer.

    "content": "24 Arts 26 October 1998\nFILUMENA Piccadilly Theatre THE FATHERING Courtyard Theatre\nY ou may have never heard of this\nplay before. Neither had I, although Judi Dench was acting\nthe title role. That's about as much as I knew before entering the theatre. Well,\nit was a very pleasant surprise. It's originally an Italian play by Eduardo de Filippo,\ntranslated here by Timberlake Wertenbaker, about a middle-aged woman, Filumena, who fakes an illness to marry the\nman that she loves. He finally accepts,\nthinking she is about to die In her bed.\nShe then bounces out of bed claiming\nthat it was all just put on. At this point,\nthe play actually starts. Domenico, Fllumena's husband, simply cannot believe\nhis eyes and is also immensely cross\nwith himself for having been fooled in\nsuch a way. The first scene between the\nnewly-weds is a jewel of humour and\nlightness.\nThey each have an ally in their fight:\nfor Domenico, his old time friend Alfredo\nand for Filumena, her \"dame de com-pag nie\" Rosalia. Domenico has been\nhaving an affair with the nurse, half his\nage, who took care of his wife. The\nwhole play has a very vaudeville feel to\nit and Is full of hilarious moments. The situation only grows more complicated\nwhen Filumena tells Domenico that she\nhas three sons, which brings absolute\nchaos to the household.\nThe acting is very good - the timing\nis always perfect and one can't help\nlaughing all the way through. Judi Dench,\nas always, is a dream to watch. She flips\nfrom one personality to another so nat-u rally. Michael Pennington is a fantastic\nDomenico and gives poor fi lumen a a very hard time too. But behind a light\nand funny exterior, the play does raise\nsome very interesting issues: the conflict\nbetween rich and poor, friendships, personal dignity and, most important of all,\nthe way people relate and manage to\nsurvive together despite all the difficulties they encounter. A lovely night out\nfull of laughs and a little reflection, amazing actors and great directing. What else\ncould one ask for?\nD. Until the end of December\nNearest tube: Piccadilly Circus\nTickets: standby places available for concessions (check beforehand)\nT he Finnish playwright Jussi\nWahlgren apparently started\ndirecting plays at the tender age\nof five. Perhaps, you can't help but won-der, if there is a hint of autobiography in\nhis play The Fathering, which tells the tale\nof how a boy \"prodigy\" is forced by his\nambitious mother down a path he\nwouldn't necessarily have chosen for\nhimself. Of course, to a certain extent we\nare ali moulded by what our parents\nwant for us. However, most of us are\nlucky enough to have a say in our future,\nbut the fate of Thomas, the lead of this\nplay, was decided for him before he\nwas even conceived.\nNow, considering himself an adult,\nhe is torn between wanting a normal life\nand still wanting to be the virtuoso\npianist that he was always told he would\nbecome. It is clear that the mother has\nhad a greater influence on his life than\nperhaps she had intended, seeing\nfriends as a distraction, denying him girlfriends and even orchestrating his first\nlay. Yet he is not strong enough to\nbranch out. Her unrelenting pushiness\nbackfires, eventually leading him to misguidedly pursue a talent he doesn't have.\nIt may sound like a well worn topic, and\nat the outset the play does indeed\nappear stereotyped and un inventive, but\nas the story unfolds it becomes clear\nthat there is much more depth to it. The\nplay explores the motivations behind\nthe characters, revealing Incidents in the\nmother's past and aspects of her life\nthat lead her to use her son as an expression of her own feelings of resentment\ntowards his dead father. We see the\nson, supposedly aged twenty, acting as\na spoilt, bratty child, trying to break free\nfrom his mother, yet still craving her\nsecurity.\nThere are also several novel twists In\nthe story, all unforeseen and perfectly\npaced. These plots and subplots come\ntogether very well, culminating in an\nengrossing final scene that leaves you\nthinking. The Fathering highlights well\nthe fine line between trying to help your\nchildren fulfil their dreams and trying to\nmake them fulfil your own, stressing the\nimportance of keeping things in per-spec ti ve. A thought-provoking play\nbrought to life by the endearing piano\ntuner Max (Peter Hamilton) - and the\nridiculous hand puppets.\nJudith and Christian\nUntil 8th November\nNearest tube: King's Cross\nTickets: concessions \u00a35.50 (Sundays, pay\nwhat you can)\nPerformance times: daily 8pm( except\nMondays)\nCRAVE Royal Court Theatre MERCE CUNNINGHAM Barbican\nA few months ago, I talked in these\npages about a play called\nCleansed, which I found such a revelation. The author, Sarah Kane, has\njust presented her latest piece. She takes\na new direction in her career by cutting\ndown on the extremely outrageous and\nsometimes very repulsive style of her\nprevious work. In Crave, she settles for\nsomething much more accessible to an\naverage theatre-goer. The four actors\nwalk onto the stage and sit next to one\nanother, facing the audience. After a few seconds they start talking furiously\nand with no particular structure. They\nrepeat words endlessly, as one of them\nstarts a sentence and the others finish it.\nThe whole process is fascinating and\nvery well performed.\nNone of the characters have names,\nonly a letter. There are no amazing set\ndesign or direction tricks and the play\ntakes place in an unnamed city; everything is kept bare, giving the words and\naction a much stronger presence than in\na usual play.\nThe author still remains faithful to\nher themes: the search for love in a world that seems so disintegrated, where\nhuman beings seem to have forgotten\nhow to communicate and interact. They\nappear to be making an enormous effort\nto get to know one another: \"M\" is trying to have a baby with \"B\", although it\nis not obvious whether they have actually met before. \"A\" is a middle-aged\nman who has had a lot of experience in\nlife and still hasn't quite found what he\nneeds. \"C\", on the other hand, is a young\nwoman learning life the hard way. Abuse\nin Sarah Kane's work is always a very\nstrong point; it often makes for very difficult scenes and situations. Sarah Kane\nis definitely enforcing her position as\none of the most exciting writers around.\nIf you still haven't seen any of her pieces,\nrun for it on the next occasion.\nD.T his year, the Barbican has put on\none of the most exciting festivals\nIn London: the international theatre event (BITE), which has brought us\nplays from all over the world, most of\nthem experimental or cutting-edge. The\nBarbican also decided to incorporate\nsome dance events into the programme,\none of them by Merce Cunningham's American company. Cunningham is part\nof that older generation of choreographers like Maurice Bejart or Pina Bausch,\nwho have been creating the most\nastounding and daring work for over 50\nyears. He brought two programmes over\nand I am very sorry to have only been\nable to see one. The performance was\nmade up of three distinct pieces, two\nrecent creations and a special composition for the festival.\nMercc Cunningham's choreography\nhas always been fascinating; all of his\nmovements arc quite simple and repetitive. But what an impact! He gets the\nmost out of his dancers and they perform perfectly. The first piece, with decor\nby john Cage, was extremely minimalist;\nthe musical accompaniment was a succession of electronic noises stretched\nout to their maximum. Of course, this\nwas also reflected in the dancing, invoking an atmosphere of deep thought.\nThe second piece was the creation for\nthe Barbican, more an \"experience of\ndance\" than dance itself. It was thrilling,\nwith yet again very bare music, emphasising the dancers' movements. The\nevening came to a close with something a little lighter: Scenario, a piece with\nthe added feature of costumes designed\nby Rei Kawakubo, the woman behind\n\"Comme des Garcons\".\nThe decor was completely white with\nvery strong lighting: the whole set was\ncompelling. The costumes restricted the\ndancers' possibilities of expression.\nCunningham's work is In a league of its\nown. When watching his creations, one\nenters a very special world where things\narc not as they seem. But one can very\neasily relate to them. This is dance and\nmore generally art at its best: daring,\ninnovative and provocative. Don't miss\nout when he next comes back to Europe.\nD. "

Ah, but fond as those\nmemories are to recall, this is no time to\nreminisce about weeks previous, more\nto provide you with an insight into John\nBirmingham's \"The Tasmanian Babes\nfiasco\".\nPut your hands up anyone who\nshares or has shared a flat or house,\ncome on we're at university for God's sake, don't most people house share? That aside, flat mates and the trials of\nsharing a house with some people you\nknow and some you don't is what this is\nall about (you can put your hand down\nnow). This is a collection of short stories\nall bound together by one big one, much\nlike the author's last book, \"He Died With\na Felafel In His Hand\". It centres around\nJB (for the book is written in the first per-son) and the story unfolds around the\nhouse's new flat mate, Jordan, who\nmoves in after two goths skewer the\nfridge with an arrow (read the book). It\nturns out that Jordan is a bit of an oddball and he proceeds to steal everything\nthat isn't nailed down, including a soda\nsiphon (read the book). What ensues is\na hard to categorise party across Eastern\nAustralia: there's your road-trip element\nin battered vans and vehicles in various\nstates of disrepair up and down the\ncoast, your advertisement for every subculture and counter-culture under the\nsun, from karate lesbians to men who\nhang naked in trees (that'll be \"Naked\nTree Guy\" then); and your visit via the\nauthor's imagination to every place,\nname and event in recent pop-culture.\nAlthough it's hard to pin the style down\nto one in particular it is a cracking insight\ninto one persons experiences in life.\nPerhaps the style isn't that hard to\nput your finger on, it's in the vein of\nIrvine Welsh and lain Banks but so many\ntimes throughout the book it strays, that\nis what makes it hard to categorise.\nI liked \"The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco\",\nI liked it a lot, but I didn't like it so much\nthat I can't spot the reasons why you\nmight not like it. There's a bit of a drugs\ntheme running through it, well when I say a bit I mean a fairly hefty one. It is\ncentral to the story and, if it is to be\nbelieved, the prologue implies that ail\nthe sub-stories are true to a greater or\nlesser extent so the drug content can't be helped. He also enjoys flitting around\nin time backwards and forwards to tell\nthese little sub-stories as characters recall\nthem. This way of writing can get tedious\nwhen you're trying to read late at night\nand you start to think, \"What just hap-pen ed? Did I miss something?\". Birmingham also lets his characters \"do all the\ntalking\": they unfurl as the story progresses (which I kinda like) and you don't get to know them until about halfway\nthrough the book.\nI was kept interested right up until\nthe end when it strangely turned into a wine review on the last three pages.\nAnd to me, that's what a book is all\nabout, you shouldn't want to put it down\n(except to have your tea and do other\nthings like sleep and talk to people) and\nI didn't. It's not the all time best book I 've\nread but I did enjoy It and perhaps the\ngreatest thing is that I learned something\nthrough reading this, I learned that there\nis another group of people out there like\nthese and that I wouldn't mind meeting\nthem.\nChristian Elliott\nSaints & Sinners\nMarcelle Bernsteine\nBantam Books\njan ie Paxton, a feature writer and inter-viewer, agrees to write the authorised\nbiography of Madga Lachowska, the cha-ras mati c spiritual leader of a group called\nthe Chalice. Although Magda Lachowska,\notherwise known as Mama, is considered a living saint in whose footsteps\nlava nder plants had been seen to bloom,\nJanie takes the job for other reasons. Her\nprofessional reputation is on the decline\ndue lo a fondness for the bottle and her\npersonal life is also a shambles as she\nhas just divorced her husband. She sees\nthe opportunity of writing Mama's biography as a means of making money and\nrestoring her reputation to its former\nglory. However, as Janie investigates\nMama's background discrepancies begin\nto emerge in the offical version of\nMama's history, and Janie has to chose\nwhether to listen to her instincts and\nuncover the real story or not.\nMarcelle Bernstein is perhaps most\nwell known for her novel \"Body and-Soul\". It was made into a TV series a few\nyears ago with Kristin Scott Thomas (of\n\"The English patient\" fame) as the lead\ncharacter, a nun with trouble up at the\nmill. Bernstein often has a religious\ntheme in her books and she has continued the trend in this one. The angle\nshe's taken is that even saints are human\nand make mistakes, and so are sinners\njust like the rest of us.\nBernstein's strength is her ability in\ncreating believable characters and then\ndeveloping those characters throughout\nthe novel. The story takes place over\nmany years, from the Nazi work camps\nin Poland during WW2 to the present\nday. The lives of those in the camp form\nan important part of the book in understanding what motivated them later on\nin their lives, and Bernstein quite adeptly\nuses flashbacks to keep the reader inter-este d. On the whole this is a very good\nbook, the kind to take on holiday to\nread on the beach. If that was the case\nI would happily fork out the money for\nit but if not, this is the kind of book I would enjoy taking out of the library.\nNicole\nICU CINEMA PRESENTS:\nFl SLIDING DOORS SHOO a ON ian s Starring Gwyneth Paltrow\nThurs 29th(8:30 pm)& Sun 1st(8 pm) Concert Hall\nUnion Building 2nd Floor \\\nDrinks available from Da Vinci's Also Showing\nMad City 6pm Thurs 29th Oct\n\n"

    "content": "News 26 October 1998\nDeputy\nDeficiency\nby Andrew Ofori\nThe air of enthusiasm that inspires the\nUnion at the outset of any new year is\nbeing severely tempered by a Sabbatical\nshortage. In keeping with previous years,\nthe position of Deputy President for\nClubs & Societies has been left vacant,\nincreasing the workload of Union officials. Fate rather than apathy was the culprit in the case of this year's staff\nshortage, with the former DP(C&S) elect\nfailing last year, forcing him to withdraw\nfrom the position.\nThe elected DPIC&S) will be responsible for the 200 Clubs & Societies, representing them to the College and\nexternal organisations such as BUSA\n(British Universities Sports Association).\nThe new incumbent will be an essential\npoint of contact to club members and\ncan expect to invest their creativity in the\nexpansive field of Student Development\nuntil yet another Sabbatical is elected to\nfocus on Welfare and Education.\nThe missing Sabbatical's duties are\ncurrently shared between Union officials; when relevant issues arise, it is the\nUnion President and the DP(finance &\nServices) who arc making the decisions,\nany requisite action is facilitated by the\nClubs & Societies Administrator. This current method of operation was described\nas a 'bit of a nightmare' by the Union\nPresident, although he did commend\nthe Administrator's dedication.\nHe felt the current lack of candidates emanated from student's reluctance to split their courses with a Sabbatical year, but with recurring issues\nsuch as health & safety and hybrid entry\nawaiting a rational mind he pleaded 'As\nlong as you're not a complete donkey\nplease stand!1\n.\nThe Union's drive to find a Deputy\nPresident is an effort to avoid their worst\nfears, a round of elections where\nDP(C&S) candidates are required for this\nyear and next. Each candidate requires\na proposer and 20 second ers; papers\ncame down on Friday with 2 potential\ncandidates standing, namely Rostam Kilgour from Physics and Material's Stuart\nCook. Today marks the beginning of 2\nweeks of campaigning around the college and this will be followed by voting\nfrom 9.00-5.00pm on the 9th&10 th November where every Union member\nhas the opportunity to vote.\nMedics\nblow cash\nby David Roberts\nNext weeks planned Medics Graduation\nhas been abandoned at a cost of \u00a37500.\nfears of low turnout and heavy losses\nalso surround the Medical Freshers Ball,\nwhich was scheduled to take place last\nSaturday (after Felix went to press).\nThe Medics Graduation Ball had\nbeen organised by the School of Medicine Rugby squad, on the understanding\nthat any profits would be diverted into\ntheir coffers. However, their decision to\nbook a hotel for the event was made\nwithout any consultation of either the\nUnion President or Deputy President,\nand without following correct Union\nfinancial procedures. As a result, a contract was signed which requires the\nUnion to pay 100% of the bill, even if a decision is made to cancel the event.\nSimilarly, the Freshers Ball was organised by the Med School Union without\nconsultation with ICU. the contract was\nfinally seen by Deputy President Chris\nInce less than a week before the event,\nand with a verbal agreement already\nmade, he thus he had no choice but to\nsign. This left the Med School Union\nneeding to sell 504 tickets for the event\nto break even - leaving the prospect of\ngreater losses looming large.\nThis financial laxity is widely regarded\nas being a direct consequence of the\nhuge scale of the combined Med School\nUnion reserves (built up over a period of\nmany years by donations and profits\nfrom events) - which stood at \u00a355 885 at\nthe beginning of August, and may not be\ntouched by ICU for the next twelve\nmonths. However, at the end of that\nperiod they will be pared down to a level comparable with the other Constituent College Union's( approximately\n\u00a32000). Thus, certain leading figures in\nICSM SU have decided that the next\ntwelve months should be treated as a gigantic spending spree, with the words\n\"Take that out of our reserves\" frequently\nechoing around Union offices. In excess\nof ten thousand pounds has already\nbeen spent, and the losses accrued by\nthese events could see the reserves\nplummet fur the t. If no action is taken by ICU, then the\nnext year could see an unprecedented\nroller coaster of spending on behalf of\nmedical students which could easily see\ntheir reserves reduced from five figures\nto four or even three.\nTrimble\nFive months\niago. two\n' bespectacled\nmen of 61\n|^?!:. and 54,\nte ppe d:> the\nstage at\nI!r,0 lit\nfront Hall,\necu the\n:\niwo stood one\" of the most famous\nIrish people of the last\ntwenty years, Bono,\nfive months ago these\ntwo men were on the campaign trail for\na YES vote in the Northern Ireland referendum following the Good Friday Agreement.\nOn Friday 16th October the same pair,\nJohn Hume MP and David Trimble MP,\nwere awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"...\nfor their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.\"\nAs somebody who grew up living a mere\nfifteen miles from John Hume's native\nDerry, I am delighted that his endless\ndedication to peace has been recognised, even if his ultimate aim has not\nbeen altogether achieved. For as long as\nI have been reading newspapers, there\nhas hardly been a day when I opened the\nNobel Peace Prize\nAs the advent of peace in Ireland captures the hearts and\nminds of the world, including the Nobel committee,\nPadraig McCloskey takes an analytical look at the two\nmain protagonists of the Peace Process.\nsheets and did not encounter the hard\nwork Hume has done for his home city\nor for the nationalists of Northern Ireland.\nJohn Hume has always been a peaceful\nman and was instrumental in bringing\nabout the IRA ceasefire in 1994 through\nsecret talks with Gerry Adams. The fact\nthat Adams is no longer regarded with\nthe same offence, he\nwas then made it all the\nharder for John Humc|\nattain his goals, esp e dally when he was I slated for the ceasefire\nbreak down. John\nHume has tirelessly\napplied himself to aiding\nNorthern Ireland's Catholics and Nationalists since the Civil Rights movement\nstarted 30 years ago. It is hoped this\naward will not be an end in itself, but\nrather John Il ume will be truly rewarded\nwith peace in our country.\nI see David Trimble as another matter\nentirely, from an early age I can quite\nhonestly say that a certain lan Paisely\nhelped me form an opinion that all\nUnionist politicians are the same, i.e. Ihey were only interested in NO politics.\nTo be fair though for many years my\nonly recollections of some towns having\nvisited them, was the size of their \"Ulster\nsays NO\" banner draped across their\nrespective town halls.\nWhen Trimble became\nthe Ulster Unionist\nParty leader I feared\nthe worst; more of the\nsame. Thankfully to\nsome extent I have\nbeen proved wrong.\nThat is, Trimble backed\nthe 1974 loyalist workers strike, was opposed to the Anglo-Irish\nAgreement and marched triumphantly\nthrough Portadown, hand-in-hand with\nlan Paisely, after the first Dumcree incident in 1995.\nI was not only shocked but overjoyed\nwhen I saw the stand he made with\nBono applauds politicians\nregards t Good Fri\nAgreemer\nMr. Trimt\nsingle-han\ned ly dragged n colleague;\ning and s ing into\nline on,\nthis\nissue\n(over half of his party's MPs\nwere opposed to the Good Hume\nFriday Agreement). Mr. Trimble had so much to lose if he failed to get\nthe overall backing from his party he\ndeserved. I will always remember his\ncourage throughout the referendum\ncampaign, and I'm sure many people\nwith similar views to myself felt the same.\nLike Gerry Adams said, \"...this is a man I could do business with\", he too is a deserving winner of this award.\nDespite the criticisms from some quarters\ndirected towards the Nobel Committee\non their choice, I feel it is not an award\nto kick-start a failing peace process, but\nmerely endorses what has gone on and\nhopefully will continue until such time\nthat every member of Northern Ireland's community can walk, drink, eat and shop\nwith no fear of violence.\n\n"

Everyone\nwas tremendously amused.\nHer Highness left behind some dis-enchantment, failing to fully acknowledge the 200 strong crowd on her\nentrance and exit. No doubt this was\nthe result of her full schedule, next involving a move north to the Albert Memorial and a spectacular opening ceremony\ninvolving fireworks, apparently costing\n\u00a325 000.\nPhoto: Froggy Her Majesty admires the BMS architect's handiwork\nMajesty was introduced to all Imperial's important persons including Dave Hellard\nand Wade Cayed, leaving her perplexed\nas to why Imperial has two union pre si dents.

The first one to arrive is\nthis, the double pack (with free mix\ndisc) Big Beat Elite Complete from\nLacerba Records. Its being marketed as\nthe best and most complete big beat\ncollection and although it is a varied set\nit comes up well short of being elite.\nEach track gives you a slightly different\nlook at the range of big beat, some\nbring a Latin style to the mix, some a hint of drum and bass.\nDisc one starts off well. The\nI ler bali ser brings us Wall Crawling Insect\nBreaks. Some excellent breaks are stuffed\nin along with the Spiderman references.\nThis is definitely worth a check. Next up\nis the funky Different Strokes by\nPsyechedelia Smith. The tune uses a highly infectious 'Nan, Nah, Nah' chou-rus. Simple but so cool. You've got to\ncheck Marlon Sea's Disco Del Marl simply for the comic value; it sounds like\nsomething from the Pulp Fiction sound-track, only faster! The standout track from\nthe first disc is The Worlds Made up of\nThis and That by Deeds Plus Thoughts;\nthis is fast and really gets you going.\nDisc Two is poor, only one track really\nstood out, that being Ruffneckftom The\nFreestylers featuring Navigator. Ruffneck\nstarts off slow till the reggae lyrics kick in\nand the beats pick up, giving an uptempo rag ga boy tune. There's a track\nfrom DJ Kool and the Crooklyn Clan called\nHere We Go Now. It follows the same\nbasic DJ Kool call and respond lines over\nsome very strange beats - please stop.\nIf you've never heard any big beat\nyou might wanna check this out, otherwise I'm sure you can wait for the next\none. H Milen\nSENTIENCE\nAn Eye For An i* \u2022\nSentience: sense perception\nnot Involving Intelligence or\nmental perception. Hmm!\nT he conditions of the universe\nhave led to life on earth, the\nonly sentient beings in creation.\nSentience are Nick Fryer, Martin\nDawson and Tom Neville. The opening\nsentence of this review is what they say\non the inlay. An Eye For An i is a cool\nblend of techno and electronic music.\nTurn up the volume, sit back, relax and\nenjoy a trip to a different world.\nThe first track is a wild demonstration\nof cool, sharp techno. Totally funky,\nheavy beats and phat drums. We hear\nperfect sampling of Onyx's/ le re'n' Now,\nin hand with minimal vocals (quite literally just the song title on Time Is Now).\nIt's wicked how the drums roll up and\nthen you're hit hard by a phat bass-line.\nMachine Directa gives you loads of\nhard beats and electronics.-Too much\nartificiality for my liking; loses its artistic\nappeal and just becomes a computer\nprogram! Eternal features more beautiful\nloops, and fresh keyboards await us on\nthe other side of the break. Loud and\nhard. Track four, Alive, begins dark and\nslow, then a female voice asks ques-t ions. The pace just picks up slightly and\nwe gradually hear sampling in the background until it takes over and breaks\naway hard. Questions are still asked\nthough, giving you plenty an opportunity\nto ponder over 'what is a brain and what\nis a mind?'. At over nine minutes of the\nsame thing it's a bit too long, I think.\nThe next three tracks are a graduation from soft to hard. A. O.K.( Everything\nIs) starts dark but very sharp. We hear the\nsound of an annoying siren in the back-ground, and the foreground doesn't move you too much either. 2nd Step\nhas funkier beats; hard and fast, reminiscent of Cypress I Nil's Latin Lingo. It\nsoftens and calms you down with fancy\nloops, but then breaks hard again. Finer\nScale holds an interesting electro intro.\nThere are no vocals on this, but who\nneeds them when the music speaks for\nitself!\nFull-on beats take you in to Magnificent Speed. It really is energetic, and it\ncontains elements from Eric B and\nRakim's Follow The Leader. The vocals are\ndeep and commanding with lovely\nbreaks all round. Pressure Them is such\na killer. The 2-3 step drum-beats are just\nas interesting as the accompanying picture on the inlay of a guy with a gun to\nhis head. Phatter beats are introduced\nlater and then comes an outer-space-like\neffect. The beats keep rolling till they\ndrop!\nExperiment On God is basically\nanother narrative just to finish off. All in\nall, Sentience have got talent and if they\nbreak into the mainstream they are going\nto do some serious damage, but it will be\ndifficult to achieve the initial rec ogni tion. Nevertheless, keep an ear out for\nsounds from the Nukleuz stable. El\nAbu\nT he problem with novelty\nrecords lies in the fact that they\nare a novelty. And, like all nov-el ties, they wear off very quickly. The\nGravelands is no exception. On paper,\nthe idea seems a winner. Get an Elvis\nPresley impersonator to sing some\n'90's songs and classics from the past,\nthat Elvis would be totally unsuited to.\nAnd hilarity, mega-stardom and a sellout appearance at the next Capital FM\ngala concert is guaranteed. Well, not\nquite...\nThe opening track is also the\nalbum's best track; a rollicking version of\nNirvana's Come As You Are. Ilea ring The King sing the line 'Well, I swear that\nI don't have a gun' is close to hysterical.\nUnfortunately, from here on, the album\ntakes a sharp down-turn. Where we\nwould expect to be treated to some\nMike Flowers-type pastiche, the ensuing\nsongs are comedy-free, the singer actually trying to create songs that will be critically acclaimed. But, with second-rate\nproduction and session musicians, that\ncan never be achieved. And, in any case,\nhis Elvis impression is not far above\nkaraoke standards.\nIt is surprising how many '60's soul\nsongs he has chosen to cover, given that\nthe main difference between him and\nthe real king is the lack of soul in his\nvoice. I len ce, Dock Of The Bay, Piece Of\nMy Heart and / Heard It through The\nGrapevine are the dreariest songs on the\nalbum and the easiest to skip over. Actually, there are a few interesting tunes\ntucked away on this 18-track compi la tion. The Small Faces' All Or Nothing gets\na humorous seeing-to, as does Sweet's Blockbuster complete with police siren.\nThe low point (without mentioning\na forgettable Voodoo Chile) arrives with\nThe King's version of No Woman No Cry,\nwhich he somehow manages to sing\nalmost all on one note, adding his own\nElvis excerpts as and when he feels e.g. 'Wise men say: no woman no cry.'\nPlayed at half speed, for no apparent reason, is a laughable rendition of\nTwentieth Century Boy. Still, it's better\nthan Placebo's offering.\nWhat could have been a hugely\nentertaining comedy record and a surprise Christmas success has turned out\nto be a pain to listen to. It looks like The\nKing's next vocation will be something\nElvis had a real interest in. Burgers and\nfries. H Fd\n\n"

Consequently, the\nnext few months will see the release of\nAntz, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Prince of\nEgyptand Iron Giant, all benefiting from\nthe magic of CGI, with not a hand-drawn eel in site.\nFirst out of the bag, however, comes\nSmall Soldiers, the story of a boy and his\nsack of plastic figurines. Following a plot\nnot a million miles away form Toy Story,\na young boy (Smith) takes possession of\nthe latest toy on the market - in this case\nthe military Commandos and their foe,\nthe peaceful Gorgonites. But everything\nstarts to go wrong when the implanted\nmunitions chips activate, leading to a full scale war between the opposing\nforces. Massive devastation results, with\nthe eponymous toys turning on Smith\nwhen he rescues the Gorgonite leader.\nWhilst on paper it probably seemed\nlike a great idea for a film, the reality is\nfar from satis facto ty. Toy Story succeeded\nbecause it appealed to adults and chi l Chlp Hazard .- Voice of Tommy Lee Jones,; BodyofArnle\nd ren alike, whereas Small Soldiers is too\nscary for small children, yet too idiotic for\nadults. That said, the visuals are still spec-t acul ar, and some of the cameos (form\nthe likes of Dennis Lcary and Phil Il art man) provide moments of joy. Even so,\nlike so much of modern I lollywood, take\naway the CGI and there's very, very little\nleft. Q Dave\nWin tickets to Exorcist courtesy of\nKENSINGTON\nWith Il allow een fast approaching,\nfilm studio executives on high have\ndecided that it might not be a bad idea\nto re-release The Exorcist, complete with\na freshly spruced up stereo soundtrack.\nAnd who's going to argue?\nMore importantly, cinema executives much closer to home have decided\nthat giving away tickets to penniless students would be kinda nice. And I'm definitely not going to argue with that.\nSo, thanks to those ever-so-nice people at the Odeon Kensington, Felix offers\nyou the chance to win a pair of tickets to\nwhat is widely recognised as one of the\nscariest movies ever made (which is still\nbanned from video release).\nFor your chance to win, simply\nanswer the following question:\nIn what year was The Exorcist\nfirst released?\nEmail your answer to fl lm. fell x \u00ae\nic.ac.uk before 6pm on Tuesday to be in\nwith a chance. Winners will be drawn at\nrandom from the virtual hat.\nThe winners of last week's Halloween 1120 competition were:\nMax Arendt\nJeremy Gosteau\nKatherlne Ruggerl\nAdam Bettlnson\nBeng K. Ool\nThey correctly identified that 1120 is\nthe seventh Halloween film to be\nreleased. Please drop into the Felix office\n(in the Quad archway) to pick up your\ntickets.\n21\nThe Sting\nReuniting the team that made Butch\nCassidy & Fhe Sundance kid a hit obviously seemed like a great idea back in\nthe early seventies. Consequently, the\non-screen pairing of Redford and Newman, plus director director George Roy\nHill were brought together one again in\n1 973 for The Sting.\nWhat resulted still stands as one of\nthe greatest caper movies of all time.\nThe twists and turns lead inexorably to\nthe final climax, which is simply a joy to\nbehold. A classic.\nGrease\nYou've all seen it, I know you have\n- no matter how much you might deny\nit, the simple fact of the matter is that\nthe whole world's seen Grease - and\n99% of them loved it. So stop living in\ndenial, and instead get some friends\nround in front of the TV and relive the\nexperience as God intended - with\ncheering singing and plenty of drink.\nSaturday Night\nFever\nIt's a source of constant surprise to discover just how many people there are\nin the world who haven't seen Saturday\nnight Fever. We all recognise the songs,\ncan flawlessly parody Travolta's dan c ing, and have the image of the seventies that SNF portrays etched on our\nminds. Yet far too many of those\namongst us haven't seen it. And that's just not good enough.\nSaturday Night Fever gave the world\nJohn Travolta, the Beegees and an\nimage of the seventies that simply\ndefines a generation.\nNightmare on\nElm Street\nOK, so Wes Craven is hardly one of the\ngreatest directors of all time, but when\nit comes to scarring the shit out of pe o ple, he could still teach Orson Welles a few lessons. Witness Nightmare on Elm\nStreet, and ignore the jaded legacy of\nutterly forgettable sequels, and you'll\nrealise what horror's all about.\n\n"

If you\nhaven't heard him before, then you have plenty of ideas of\nnew music to check out from the last paragraph!\nI was lucky enough to meet Steve recently .,\nwhen he paid a visit to London and made a guest appearance on The Electric Cafe radio A show. I knew that as well as being a talented I music maker he was an excellent DJ, but Ij| had never had the chance to sample his\ndeck skills. I le played a great one hour set\nfor the show; minimal techno from th\nlikes of the Advent and Jeff Mills with\ngreat emphasis on the way the tracks\nwere mixed. \"For me it's based A on mixing a lot; to fit tracks\ntogether because some of\nthem are quite empty on\ntheir own. To create layers of\ntracks.\" Indeed, the latest i Sterac album (Thera on 100% j Pure) incorporates this j harder sparser sound.\nThis is quite a departure I from the old Rachmad j sound of a few years back, jI lis style then was more |\nmelodic and delicate, lie' incorporated strings a lot\nmore, and the overall sound\nwas fuller and richer. Steve\nacknowledges this as a natural pro-gres sion. Starting with the bare minimum of\nequipment at the age of twelve (a mixer\nwith no cue, one record deck with no pitch\ncontrol and a tape recorder!) Steve learnt\nthrough experimentation how music was const uc ted and how-to have fun playing around with it! \"After a while I wanted to\ndo more so I did remixes of existing tracks. I played melodies\nover the track or let a drum machine play alongside the track.\nAfter a while you want to do more and more so I started composing my own music.\"\nAs a DJ, Steve is finding himself more and more in demand\nover Europe. \"I played in Cosmos parties in Belgium, in Ghent\nI'm their resident but they do parties every four or five months.\nAlso a few clubs in and around Amsterdam. I 've been to\nSwitzerland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland and Scotland.\nI still prefer Belgium because people are really into it there!\"\nSteve is very modest about his mixing skills. \"For me I taught myself mixing when I was twelve. But I didn't make\nmyself any mix tapes to give to a club because I didn't want\nto play at a club every week. I would have heard the same\nrecords week. I was afraid that I would get tired of them so I didn't do that. Then I was doing 80s disco stuff, for example\nJammin' few is, Janet Jackson, I lu man fe ague, Alexander\nO 'Neal and of\ncourse Babyface and\nguys like The System.\nThose are really my\ninfluences.\"\nAs mentioned\nabove, Steve's musical sound has developed over time. He\nattributes this to his\nroots. \"The first\nrecords i bought\nwere 80s disco, but I always listened to a lot of different styles of music in the old\ndays. I think the only thing I didn't listen to was the\n\u2022 hip-hop thing that was going on. I wasn't really into\nthat. I loved a lot of different styles of music, and I didn't only want to do one thing.\"\nI After releasing so much of his own comp oF s it ions, Steve has decided to put out his own DJ\nmix CD. Called Emerging, you can find it on a label\ncalled Emerge. Steve describes it as his \"business\nard\" In other words it is a perfect introduction to his\ning style, the types of tracks he plays and how\nhe puts them together. This is very good minimal techno with one or two twists. Check out\nthe very first section; from the pure classical\nstrains of Icct I led ral by Philip Glass and the\nAphex Twin he manages to find a seamless mix into the techno-dub of Maurlzio.\nDespite the abundance of minimal\ntechno mixes on the market nowadays,\nthis is one I would recommend to any DJ,\nclub ber or individual who is interested in\nthe music in general. And do look out for\nthat name; Steve Rachmad. I le's going\nto be big!\nAlick Sethi\nCompetition\nThe Electric Cafe has three copies of\nthe new Steve Rachmad mix CD Emerging on Emerge Records, to give away. All\nyou have to do Is answer this simple ques-tion.

It paid off\nwhen a shot from just outside the 18-yard box from Loz, managed to get past\nthe keeper. IC continued to have most\nof the play during the first half, without\ntoo many attempts on goal. About 10\nminutes before half time IC won a cor-ner, which was played into the penalty\narea and in clearing the ball, one of\nQMW's handled the ball. Jules, our cap-tain, stepped up and put the penalty\naway.\nThe rest of the first half passed with-put incident. After the break, IC continued where they had left off, taking\nmost of the posse sion, but not having\nmany shots on goal. It wasn't until\nabout the 70th minute that IC scored\ntheir third goal. From the corner Tony\ngot to the ball first and put in a great\ngoal. IC dominated the rest of the\nmatch and had a few long-range efforts\nbut, again, did not really test the keeper.\nQMW did not really have a chance on\ngoal in the second half. The closest they\ncame was a good f re kick halfway\nthrough the first half. It was a good per-form ance, giving IC something to build\non for the coming weeks.\n4th XI\nIC 7 - 0 LSE\nPlaying the same team twice at the start\nof the season is never ideal, tv en if you win the first game the usual apathy associated with all IC can set in,\nresulting in a below par performance in\nthe second game, and losing the\nfirst game just tends to de moral is e you.\nHowever it was quite different in\nthese two games. Losing the BUSA game\nmerely strengthened our resolve to overpower the same LSE team three days\nlater in the ULU League.\nIn BUSA we were actually leading 2-0 at half time, thus to lose from such a position was extremely galling (perhaps\nsomething to do with the apathy?).\nThe three goals we conceded in the\nsecond half came about from sharp\nincisive forward power play from the\nEconomists, lacklustre defending from\nthe Imperialists and, to be honest, shite\ngoal-keeping from the Custodian.\nCredit has to be given to the whole\nteam who apart from the obvious lapses\nin concentration played some neat football more rec ogni sant of the silky\nskills of Bury LC than the previous tirade\nof long balls served up by previous\nFourth teams, tor the record the quality\ngoals were scored by Adam\nand John.\nThen, strengthened by a couple of\nnew players for the Saturday game IC\nsimply dominated from start to finish.\nAgainst the wind in the first half it was\nalways going to be tough, but LSE only\nmanaged one shot on target, saved su\nper bly by STU, the prospective candidate for DP (C&S). Some remarked that\nit was possibly his best save in his five\nyears at IC; though the previous two\nsaves weren't really up to that much\nanyway. Some inspired (???) substitutions at half time enabled the Famous\nFootballing fourths to cruise to a famous\nvictory, reaffirming themselves to be the\nbest Fourths in London. Peyrouz scored,\nAdam scored a couple, Bertie a hat trick\nand Chris a wonder goal. It all bodes well\nfor the future...altogether now\n\"A,B,C,D,E, F,G..\" SCOREBOARD\nSat 17 Oct 1998 Div 5 ICV 1\n-7 LSE VI\nDiv 2 KCL II 2-3 ic: II Div 6 ICVI 1\n-7 RSM II\nDiv 2 IC 1\n1\n1 0\n-1 ICSM II Wed 14th Oct 1998\nDiv 3 IC IV 7-0 LSE IV BUSA LSE iV 3-2 IC IV\nBadminton\nDelusions of Grandeur\nThis summer has seen much change in\nthe college buildings as part of the continual renaissance of the campus, none\nmore so than the refurbished Great Hall.\nUnfortunately it was discovered that the\ncontractors had laid the wrong kind of\nsurface for badminton. This means a special carpet/synthetic surface has to be\nlaid each time it is required for play and\neven this has not proved satisfactory to\nthe purists of the game. All this despite\nthe fact that the Union had been established as one of the key members of the\nUser Group in meetings prior to the\nbuilding work approaching the end of\nlast term.\nThe other more contentious issue\narising from the redevelopment is the\naccessibility the Union now has to the\nGreat Hall. Owing to the work done on\nit, the Great Hall now boasts retractable\nseats. This is not the instantaneous high\ntechnology as suggested by its de scrip tion. For instance, if the badminton club\nwanted to use the hall, a \"specially\ntrained\" crew of four staff would need\nto spend five hours to take away the\nseats and prepare the floor. As this costs\n\u00a3200 a go there is still debate as to who\npays, the Conference Office or the\nUnion. This also has wider ramifications\nfor other Union activities represented at\nthe great hall such as the \"East meets\nWest\" show for one prominent example.\nICU president, Dave Hcllard conceded that this oversight \"was nothing\nmalicious\" but declared that because\nthe Union was not culpable for this error\nit should not have to be burdened with\nthe associated costs. However, some of\nthe more cynical old hacks would say\nthat a change of guard at the Union\nhelm had given the Estates Office the\nideal opportunity to take advantage and\npossibly expunge Union interest from\nthe Sherfield building.\n(OK...so this coul mn should be headed\nBadminton Surface, but no-onc bothered to give mc any other sports stories\n- Gus)\nD 'Oh!\nNo women'sX Country team\nEven by Imperal's standards the turnout\nfor the women's team at the ULU Xcountry meet at Parliament Hill was, to\nsay the least, abysmal.

Goals came\nfrom \"Captian\" Dave, \"Vice\" Moony,\n\"Twinkle-toes\" Tim, \"Devious\" Derek, a double strike from \"Pieman\" Phil and\nnone other than Barry McGuigan him-self, who struck a knockout blow by\nsweetly sweeping a right hook into the\nmouth of the goal.\nWe can't get too big-headed, but\nwe're at the top of the table after just\none game and we agreed in the changing room afterwards that it would be too\nmuch effort to move from the top spot.\nSo, Mines, let's dig deep and, save any\npitfalls, show 'em what we're capable\nof.

    "content": "8\nColumns 26 October 1998\nRight Angles to Reality\nI don't dance. Not since the \"Boncy\nM Affair\" at Leonard Gliterstein's par-ents' barbecue party in 1978 when,\nfull of youthful exuberance, six bowl ful s of sherry trifle and half a glass of Double\nDiamond I threw myself rather too forcefully into \"Brown Girl in The Ring\" and\nthen threw up on the Gliterstein's garden\nfurniture. I really can't see what all the\nfuss was about. The sun lounge r escaped virtually unscathed because I vomited into the lap of Leonard Gliterstein's mother's great aunt Lene who\nwas the guest of honour at the event, it\nbeing her ninetieth birthday and all. Anyway as I pointed out at the time, it was-n't as if the dress suited her already -1\nthink Chanel is wasted on the over-75s, made to measure or not - but she was-n't having any of it. She just kept coming at me, spittle flying from the corners\nof her mouth, her face a twisted mask of\nhate, alternately leaning on one of her\nsticks and swinging the other wildly at\nwhat, to a child of nine, was head height.\nIn fact, recalling the situation, I think she\nwas more to blame than anyone for the\ngarden shed being set on fire. If she'd only given up the fight after she fell for\nthe first time, I might not have backed\ninto the barbecue and sent it flying with\ninevitable consequences. Still, it could\nhave been worse; great aunt Lenc only\nbroke one of her hips and the burns\ninflicted by flying embers were kept\ndown to second degree. Unfortunately\nhowever, the shed itself and the upper\ntwo floors of the house next door were\nbeyond saving. The repercussions with\nMr and Mrs Golightly the next door\nneighbours went on for some time, and\nthere we te even those who went as far\nas to try to pin the blame on me. But as\nmy father told the subsequent local government enquiry, it was hardly my fault\nthat in an effort to eco no mise after Mr\nGolightly had lost his job due to a global\nslump in the lava lamp market, they had\nlet their Lire and Contents insurance\nlapse. You'll be glad to know that we\nmanaged to get the stain off the dress\nafter four washes although Leonard's mother was on Valium for rather longer.\nI bring all this up to try to impress\nupon you the fact that I don't like to\ndance although I admire and envy people who do. Those ballroom fans\namongst you will no doubt have heard\nof the Tarantella, a fiery Latin dance that\nnobody north of Barcelona can do prop-er ly.I was once told that the moniker of\nthis comes from the fact that its apparently random and violent, jerky movements are supposed to represent\nsomeone in the death throes that result\nfrom being bitten by a tarantula. The\nTarantella was, you understand, invented\nin pre-Lcstasy days when the only way to\nget your kicks was to cheat death with a giant hairy arachnid. Did the older generation back then shake their heads, I wonder, in sad what-kind-of-world-is-this-when-our-youngsters-have-to-get-spi-de red out-of-their-tiny-minds-in-order-to-enjoy themselves type disbelief ? Were\nthere banner headlines in the Tijuana\nTimes dec tying the pernicious evil of\narachnid abuse or gritty \"real life\" interviews in the LI Dorado Evening Chronicle with Mexican teenagers who, having\nstarted on tarantula had graduated onto\nthe hard stuff and now had 300 peso-a day Black Widow habit ? Possibly. The\ntruth of the matter is that I don't really\nwant to think about it because if there's one thing I'm even worse at than dancing it's dealing with spiders, and so to\nhave the two things come lumped\ntogether Is for me, a scenario of unimaginable horror. A bit like if the Bay City\nRollers reformed and went on a world\ntour with Darts.\nNow I don't mean to imply that I'm a total ara ch no phobic. I don't jump up\non a chair, pulling up my petticoats and\nyelling \"Thomas, Thomas\", but the fact\nremains that spiders are definitely persona non gr at a in my apartment, they\ndon't pay rent or Council lax and therefore have got no business making themselves at home. I know it sounds mean\nspirited but there you are. The problem\nlies in the fact that however hard I try, the\nspiders just don't take the hint. It's got so\nbad that it's like the insect house at Windsor Safari Park in my flat (yes, I know spiders aren't insects, take it up with the\nHead of Creepy-Crawlies at the loo).\nTo begin with I used to kill them\noutright with the flip-flops that my parents brought me back from Cyprus and\nwhilst this was devastating ly effective, it\ndid not present a long term solution to\nthe infestation. I next tried a policy of\ninflicting debilitating but non-lethal\nwounds on the insurgent in the hopes\nthat he (or she, I never stopped to ask)\nwould be partially incapacitated but not\nto the extent that he wouldn't be able to\ndrag himself back to the nest to warn all\nthe others of the fate that awaited them.\nBut even this enlightened, sc mi Jainist\napproach seems to have failed judging\nyesterday's encounter.\nI had got back rather later than usual\n- I'd foolishly assumed that because both\nthe destination indicator on the platform\nand the sign on the front of the train that\nI had boarded said Wimbledon, that the\ntrain itself was going to Wimbledon. Having fumbled around in my trouser pocket\nfor a not unpleasant five minutes I took\nmy keys out of my briefcase and opened\nthe door. There it was. Only it wasn'ta spider. It was a SPIDER. It sat there crossing and un crossing its Chewbacca-like\nlegs, regarding me with a haughty look\nin its ten beady eyes, a sarcastic half-smile\nplaying about its mandibles. To say that\nit was huge would be to say that George\nBest played football. To add insult to\ninjury, it was smoking one of my cigarettes (no only kidding, it was actually\nsmoking a hand-rolled one). My first\ninstincts were to finish it off with a single blow from my Hush Puppies, but I hesitated - what if they only worked on\ndogs ? Besides, there was no guarantee\nthat it wouldn't grab the sole of my shoe\nand twist me off balance with a deft flick\nof one of its wrists - a spider this size\nmight even know judo. Robert the Bruce\nwould probably have drawn some kind\nof strength and encouragement from\nthe situation, but not this s as e nach. Trying to retain as much dignity as possible\nI darted into the lounge slamming the\ndoor behind me, and waited until my\nbreathing had normal is ed and the\nintruder had slunk out of the front door\nchuckling menacingly.\nI 've not seen him since. Since I hermetically sealed all the windows and\ndoors that is. Some people might say that\nsuch behaviour is going a bit far and\nmaybe they're right. And when you think\nabout it it's a bit silly really. After all you're\nso big and they're so small.

Your\nhead finally hitting your pillow / your\nmate's floor.... a floor, never before the\ndisrespectful hour of 5a.m., when the\nbirds annoyingly decide to give you a rendition of their version of 'Morning has\nBroken'.

Welcome to student life!\nNo doubt, at this very minute, thousands of fresher s are getting over bouts\nof 'fresher s' flu', and experiencing the\npost-fresher s' we ck blues, with various\nstrains of paracetamol-resistant hang-overs.

The initial\nexcitement becomes over-shadowed by\nthe increasing pile of essays and projects\nyou have to hand in and the looming\nend-of-term exams that your tutors won't let you forget about.\nAnd then when you finally get promoted to the upper years, you start seeing everything in a different light. Life\nseems less rousing and you find that\nyou have lost the ability to cope with the\nwhole morning-after fiasco. You sec the\nnew intake of fresh-faced students, oozing idealism from every pore, full of\nenthusiasm and getting excited at just\nabout everything and anything.

The thought of a C&G mortgage,\nnasty Pampers, parents evenings and\nVirgin pension plans makes the contents\nof your stomach churn, far more than\ncider ever could.\nAlright... so you're quite content to\nbe floating around in the waiting-room\nof adulthood, a string of forty-some-things in front of you in the queue, comforted by the fact that you can at any\npoint indulge yourself in juvenile pranks,\nbut act like an adult when you have to.\nSo what?

It is a single player platform\ngame and has many similarities to Shiny's most well known game - Earthworm Jim.\nThe gameplay is basically the same as\nany other platform game, with the requisite sub-games and puzzles. I he plo l is the usual kind thing you get - you play\nas Wex Major (\"Earth teenager and reluctant hero\"), leading\nthe Wild 9 (a group\nof 9 wild \"misfits\")\nagainst the villain\nKarnC'a gargantuan\nvillain with a taste\nfor inter-planetary\nredecorating\").\nAlthough this does-n't sound particularly interesting so\nfar there are a number of reasons for it\nbeing one of the better games of its\ngenre.\nNumber 1: the game is a very polished and impressive production. The\ngraphics, sound effects and soundtrack\nare high class. Especially for platform\ngame, the 3D graphics are superb. Number 2 is your weapon, the Rig - \"the\ngalaxy's most powerful weapon\". Well,\nthat's quite a big exaggeration, but it is\ninteresting playing with it for a while. The\ngame still wouldn't be very good without\nthe main reasons. Which are number 3:\nits sense of humour, which is seen quite\nvividly in number 4: your ability to torture\nyour enemies. You can trap these stupid\ncreatures and blow them up, burn them,\ndecapitate them, drown them, slice\nthem, electrocute them, impale them\nor puree them. This is fun. You can also\nuse them as bridges to get over pools of\nacid. This is also fun. The only problem\nis that creatures look too ridiculous to be\nrealistic and the pleasure from sadistic\ntorture is diminished.\nIt would be much\nmore fun if your enemies were 'cute'\nfluffy animals or pe o ple, except that of\ncourse the Daily Mail\nwould start a hate\ncampaign and the\ngame would be\nbanned. I'm not just\ndetailing all these torture methods\nbecause I'm a sadist. It is essential to\nlearn the right way to kill a certain creature before you can proceed.\nOverall then - if you like platform\ngames I would definitely recommend it.\nIt is well designed and the 13 different\nworlds makes for an extensive game\narea. The puzzles and general gameplay is good. Otherwise, although it is a fun game it gets a bit repetitive after a while, and generally is not very original.\nIt is a platform game after all.\nChiron Mukherjee\nNews\nTomb Raider III\nLara is back. With the latest dose of Running, jumping and provocative bum wiggling being promised for November 15th the hype machine is into gear with 5\nminute cinema adverts and press launch\nparties at the Natural\nHistory Museum winning over the press in\none evening.\nOnce again tomb\nRaider will make the\nnumber one chart by\nChristmas with the\nnew lighting effects\nand the emphasis on\nmore puzzle ele-ment s. This should make the game a mix\nof the pure action Tomb Raider II game,\nand the very puzzle orientated Tomb\nRaider, from what I managed to see\nthere are some very nice touches with\nthe Al being tweaked allowing Lara to\nhide from the baddies, and guns smoking after being fired. The London scenes\nlooked very impressive with rain in the\noutdoor parts and nice church stained\nglass effects in the indoor parts. Ihe\nPlaystation version is also tweaked and\nnow runs in high-res mode (it makes her\nbreasts slightly less pointy). The trophy\nof the night were 30\ncm high golden statuettes of Lara herself.\nJournalism being a honourable profession they ail d is sap eared before the\nend of the night.\nWe will be\nreviewing this as\nsoon as we get a copy and we fight it out on who gets the\ncopy to review. Now where is my\nfavourite broken newcastle brown bottle.\nGS\nPsygnosis\nfollowing on from the release of the\nold arcade classics on the Playstation it\nappears that the release\nof PC classics on the PS\nis in full flow. Psygnosis\nhas decided to release\nLemmings and the\nsequel 'oh no not more Lemmings' on\nthe Playstation masses. Since 1991 Lemmings have plagued over 3 million people with their appalling stupidity and\ntheir ability to step into furnaces, off\nhigh platforms and generally lo endanger their lives in entertaining ways. Only\ndetermined and frantic activity meant\nthe difference between a load of live\nlemmings and a horrible pile of mush on\nthe ground.\nSo basically it's a1991 game being\nreleased in 1998. The game is still as\ngood as it always was, even if the PS controller is a pain - hopefully the PS mouse\nwill be supported in the full version (it\nshould make it much more like a game\nand less like an instrument of torture).\nYou have your usual limited motley crew\nof special lemmings. Digging, mining,\nfloating, climbing, bashing, bridge building and best of all the bomb lemmings\n(turn your lemmings into small bundles\nof sem tex and blow your\nway through the wall). The\ngraphics are nice but nothing special and as puzzle\ngames go it is a good and\nworthy classic game but when compared\nagainst newer puzzle games like kul a world it does reek of a early 1990's game.\nA game worthy of game of the year, it's a shame that the year happens to be\n1992.\nGS\nRed Alert - Retaliation\n(Playstation)\nVirgin Interactive \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nYou've done the world domination bit in\nRed Alert, taken the Soviets to London or\nthe Allies to Moscow and generally spent\nseveral sleepless nights going through\nyour mind whether you should have\nbuilt another ore refinery rather than\nthat spanking new tank.\nWhat has Retaliation got\nto tempt you to go on\nanother mass killing\nspree?\nWell there are new\nand powerful weapons, \u00a7|\nwhich go towards balancing the power of the two sides on land\nand sea. The Soviets get missile launching subs to match the allied cruisers,\nand tc sla tanks and infantry to provide a bit of punch to the soviet attack. The\nallies seem to get the raw end of the\ndeal with the only new important\nweapon being the e hro no tank which\nhas the habit of being\nable to pop up behind\nthe lines of battle chewing enemy base for\nlunch.\nWith this new\narmour y there arc 32 new\nmissions (16 for each side) to tackle\nwhich go from the fairly straightforward\nto the incredibly annoying and difficult.\nThis is compounded with the problem\nthat games can only saved after completing a battle and not during the bat-tle. There are also new cut and intro\nsequences - yes eye candy perhaps but\nanything for a bit of atmosphere.\nAlso with a nearby friend with a spare Playstation and TV, the PlayStations\ncan be linked up and old scores can be\nsettled using the blood of\nWKf your troops rather than using\n~\" a broken newcastle brown\nbottle, (frankly grinding their\nnoses into the floor in this\ngame can be very satisfying\nand less likely to have you at\none of Her Majesty's Hotels.)\nThe game is not perfect though.\nWithout a mouse it is a pain to move\nacross the map quickly enough and during the link up game it occasionally\ndecides to slow down to a complete\ncrawl. Also comparing it against the PC\nversion it does come second with lower\nresolution on the screen and an in a bil Hit y to play it across a link\nmore than a few metres and\nmore than two people. But if\nyou have not got a PC and\nhave missed out on the original Red Alert go and buy it.\nThough don't blame me if\nyour skin starts to pale and eyes become\nsunken because of lack of sleep.\nGS\n\n"

I would like\nto say that the event will be remembered by those students present for years\nto come, but it simply isn't true. Hundreds of students (both inside and outside the BMS) were waiting to sec her\nMajesty, and all they got was a fleeting\nglimpse as she moved between car and\nlobby. No 'walk about' not even a friendly wave and pause for amateur\nphotographers. Maybe I am bitter, as I was not presented to her Majesty and,\nlet's face it, the real reason she was in the\narea was to open the renovated Albert\nMemorial - we merely provided a one\nhour hors d'o eu vre. Many students will\nremain disappointed, however.\nFurthermore, the speeches and\nAbove board?\nentire ceremony focused on Imperial's 'New School of Medicine'. Now I am\nnot one to criticise medics, and their\npresence at South Kensington is indeed\nvery welcome, but as a former biologist\nI would have appreciated more acknowledgement of Biology's role in the new\nbuilding. It is, after all, the Biomedical Sciences Building, and not just the Alexander Fleming Building.\nNot one to let sleeping dogs lie, it\nwas with considerable amusement I studied the model of Soulh Kensington\nerected in the BMS for the occasion. It\nwas a good model, a very good model\n- too good, in fact. The pond in the\nmiddle of the Queen's Lawn was certainly a surprise, and Dalby Court looked\nas though it had been taken straight\nfrom a Cambridge college. Okay, so it\nwas how the campus will one day (cons\nin the future) look. I just can't help feeling that by the time the 'temporary'\nboiler house has been removed, our\n\"attractive car-park\" (see letters page)\nhas been built, and some rare and\nexpensive trees have been found for\nthe Court, Prince William will be drawing\nhis pension.\nOn a less cynical note, however, the\ncollege must be congratulated for organising the event in the first place, and for\ndealing admirably with a falling door and\nfailing lifts.
