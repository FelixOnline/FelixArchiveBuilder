    "content": "Clubs FELIX, Wednesday December 10th198624 ICCAG - the Soup Run\nThe Imperial College Community\nAction Group (ICCAG) organises a soup run which takes place every\nThursday. The soup run takes\nbread, soup, biscuits and tea to\nhomeless people in London.\nSociety's social conscience\nmanifests itself as numerous 'hand\nouts' of food, drink, clothing etc.\nmade available to London's homeless. These are often provided\nby 'professional' soup runners who\ncall at un social hours and are\nusually abrupt. Probably the most\nimportant thing about our soup run\nis not therefore the food we bring,\nbut that we bring a group of\nstudents willing to listen and talk.\nWe leave Weeks Hall every\nThursday evening at about 9.15 pm,\ntaking a union van full of people and\nfood to Lincoln's Inn Fields and\nEmbankment.\nWe return to College by 11.30pm. This term support for the soup run\nfrom students has not been as good\nas it could have been, so I hope that\npeople reading this will consider\njoining us next term. I don't know\nanyone who has ever regretted\ncoming, neither is it a regular\ncommitment.\nI would especially ask that\nanyone in London over the\nChristmas holiday would come on\nthe soup run on the 18th of\nDecember which will be our last run\nbefore next term.\nThousands of people in London\nare homeless. These vary from\nteenagers who have run away from\nhome, to ex 'professionals' who\nhave dropped out of the rat race. A lot have had nervous breakdowns\nand are thus unable to cope with\n'normal' society. All these people,\nhaving no fixed address, are stuck in\na trap from which it is almost\nimpossible to escape. You can't get a job without an address etc. Last\nweek, one of the homeless people I was talking to gave me a copy of this\npoem, which he had adapted from a song 'The streets of London':\nYou've heard the song\n- Maybe taken in each word\nYet I 've seen beneath the surface\nAnd every note Tve heard.\nFor on the streets of London\nWhere the lonely tread each day\nI have slept upon the flagstones\nAnd tried to will my cares away.\nI have met the old lady\nWith a carrier bag her home\nI have followed the old man\nNow so lost and so alone.\nSo I can tell you of the loneliness\nAnd of the sun that doesn't shine\nYet I 've seen you in the street,\nCould a song ever change your mind?\nPaul\nDerek Hill\nICCAG Soup Run Coordinator.\nChristian Union: A discourse on Death\nDeath. Not a very nice word really.\nIt's not the sort of thing that you\nwant to talk about in polite -company. Tends to stop\nconversations and cause awkward\nsilences. Death has no respect for\nage, colour, religion or sex; it comes\nto us all, no matter who we are. It is\nnot sexist or racist, nor does it hold\nany political views, and it is truly\ncosmopolitan. (Wot?-Ed). Problem\nis that we want to avoid it. Everyone\nwho has ever lived and, dare I say it,\nanyone who ever will, is going to\nmeet death. (Td never have worked\nthat one out-Typesetter)\nAll pretty morbid so far, isn't it?\nWell, there is some more cheering\nnews. No, I haven't found an elixir\nof life! Well, not exactly. However,\nthere is one man who is greater even\nthan death. Just before you start to\nswitch off at the sound of another\nfunny farm case, take a fresh look at\nJesus. Well, the last time you took a look, you were probably an angel in\nthe church nativity play or half\nasleep in the school chapel. Jesus\nwas the one who said \"I am the\nresurrection and the life\" and then\nraised a man from the dead. Most\nincredible of all, he himself rose\nfrom the dead. Fairy stories! It's probably the best attested fact in\nhistory if you will bother to look.\nApathy won't do here; if Jesus rose\nfrom the dead, then isn't it about\ntime that you started listening to\nwhat he actually had to say, rather\nthan what you think he said. How\ndo you find out? Pick up any of the\ngospels in the New Testament of the\nBible\u2014Matthew, Mark, Luke or\nJohn\u2014and read an historical\nbiography about the man around\nwhom history pivots!\nCookery\nJasmine\nSmith\nShock, horror, gasp, faint! There\nwas a response to this column's first\nappearance. Thanks for pointing\nout the misdirected arrow on one of\nthe diagrams. My correspondent\nhas sent in a recipe for boiled eggs\nwith bread soldiers made using a non-automatic kettle, a cup and\nteaspoon. I shall not go into the\nprocedural details of how to achieve\nthe best results, but shall leave it to\nyou, the reader, to rush out and in a truly scientific manner attempt to\ndiscover the fastest and easiest way\nof obtaining the desired end\nproduct.\nLet us move on to a different\nproblem. One which has dogged the\nhuman community for hundreds, if\nnot thousands of years. A problem\nclose to many people's hearts. It is a subject which causes severe anguish,\narouses deep sympathy, is not\nspoken lightly of but treated with\ngreat respect and if someone can\nthink of a way to solve it, they'd be\nstinky-poo rich overnight. Yes, it's the dreaded HANGOVER!\nTake a breather while you recover\nfrom the shudders this word\nproduces. Those of you who have\nno experience in this matter can\nobtain blow by blow accounts from\nyour friends. Instead we shall turn\nour beady eyes to an aspect which\nhas exercised even the most able\nbrains: THE CURE\nNo, not the rockband, but the\nrelease from the hangover. This\ntopic is surrounded by an air of\nmystery and mystique. The\nimagination throws up images of\ntoad's spittle, bat's urine and other\nsuch delicacies. People ga wp in awe\nat whoever has the audacity to\nsuggest that they know the answer\nto this ailment. I say poppycock,\nbalderdash and fiddlesticks! We all\nkYi ow the answer\u2014don't drink. But\nto most of us this would make social\nintercourse a trial instead of a pleasure.\nThis is the time of year when\nmany will be suffering from the\nexcesses of the night before. In order\nthat we can continue the scientific\nmoulding of our brains, I have\ncompiled a list of the \"cures\" which\nfrequently are suggested as dead (!?)\ncert s: \u2014drinking something alcoholic\nfirst thing next morning (surely this\njust makes you legless again ?)\n\u2014drinking lots and lots of water\nbefore collapsing in a pathetic heap\non one's bed.\n\u2014drinking lots of orange juice\nbecause it's liquid and contains\nsugar (then why doesn't hot, sweet\ntea work?)\nThey all seem to involve drinking!\nIs this significant? I think we should\nbe told. Happy experimenting and I look forward to your reports next\nterm!\nJasmine Smith\nTwo Medals\nOn Sunday 30th November, the\nOrienteering Club went to Epping\nForest to compete in the London\nchampionships. Despite the bitterly\ncold weather and muddy condition,\n.two members won medals. Mr.\nBruce Ainsworth (Geology 3) won\nthe M19A silver medal and Miss\nClare Caulfield (French Institute 2)\nwon the W19 bronze medal. This\nupheld the excellent record of the\nclub, in the London championships.\nThe other members all completed\ntheir courses, whether running,\nwalking or even swimming(!) with\nthe incentive of liquid refreshment\nat the end (ie the orange juice!)\nAmnesty\nVigil\nToday (December 10th) is United\nNations Human Rights Day. To\nmark the occasion IC Amnesty\nalong with LSE Amnesty are\nholding a vigil outside the Soviet\nEmbassy in support of IC's adopted\nPrisoner of Conscience, Ivan\nStarovoit. Starovoit was imprisoned\nin the USSR for peacefully\npractising his religion as a Jehovah's Witness. The vigil will be from 2pm to 5pm. Please come along with us\nand show your concern for human\nrights. We will be leaving the Royal\nAlbert Hall steps (on Prince\nConsort Road) at 1.30. If you want\nto get involved in Amnesty's campaigns we meet every Tuesday\nevening at 5.30 in the Brown\nCommittee Room on the top floor\nof the Union Building.\nFilm Soc\nPremiere\nLast Thursday night, Imperial\nCollege Film Society had its first\nfilm evening. One hundred and sixty\nstudents packed Physics LT1 to see\n' Clockwise' starring John\nCleese\u2014an uproarious tale of one\nday in a school headmaster's life,\nwhen his whole world falls apart\naround him.\nThe film was brilliant\u2014\nabsolutely hilarious, and with the\naudience joining in, clapping and\ncheering towards the end, a good\nevening was had by all.\nNext term, Film Society hopes to\nhold more evenings of the same sort,\non a regular basis. Next time\nrefreshments may be provided, and\nthe second projector will be\nworking, to bring a more\nprofessional air to the show.\nIf you would like to know more\nabout Film Society, or would like to\nbecome a member, please come\nalong to the Union Lounge at\n.^..30pm this lunchtime.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Wednesday December 10th198610 Christine's Christmas Bit\nWell, amazingly enough it appears\nto be \"write something festive\" time\nalready. Difficult one, this; having\nguarded my image closely for a whole six months-the cantankerous\nidiot who threatens people at UGMs\nwhile secretly furthering her own\nraving pink o ambitions (not to\nmention making life hard for the\nfun-loving CCUs, just for the hell of\nit) it seems a shame to lose it all in\none go. (I don't think that was a sentence-Ed). However I suppose I 'll\njust have to face the facts and own\nup to being a lovable human being\nafter all.\nOf course that's' not the only\nproblem about writing bits for the\nChristms FELIX\u2014anything I write\nnow will be out of date by the time it\ngets to you; because of the\nChristmas break there's little chance\nof generating response to any\nserious comments; and more to the\npoint, my brain appears to have\ngone into hibernation leaving me\ndevoid of inspiration. So forget the\nserious bit and accept a Happy\nChristmas instead.\nSo what do raving lefties do at this\ntime of year? Don't ask me...I'm going home for a week, looking\nforward to twelve hours sleep a night, nut roast, and teddy bears\nwrapped in recycled paper...Well,\nwhatever you do this holiday, I hope\nit's fun. And a special Happy\nChristmas to all the Union office,\nJen, Pat, Kathy, Jackie and\nGutman, and thanks for putting up\nwith me so far.\nHave a good holiday, see you in\nJanuary.\nChristine\nWho is\nAverage?\nDuring the first two weeks of next\nterm IC Union will be conducting\nthe largest survey of Imperial\nstudents ever attempted. This article\nattempts to explain the reasons for\nthis project and how it hopes to\nachieve useful results.\nThe Union has in the last few\nyears acquired control of its own bar\nand catering facilities which it plans\nto develop. Eventually plans will\nhave to be drawn up for the future\ndevelopment of the entire Union. To\ndo this we need accurate\ninformation about the lifestyle and\nsocial habits of students. For the\nunion to develop the right facilities it\nhas to know what students do with\ntheir leisure time, what their eating\nhabits are and how much they have\nto spend.\nThere is also an increasing\namount of debate about changing\nfinancial circumstances of students.\nHowever there seems to be little\nreliable data about the current\nposition of IC students. Imperial is\nnot an average university, if such a thing exists, and so we need to\nsurvey our own population rather\nthan rely purely on nationally\nproduced statistics.\nFinally there are perennial\nquestions about what exactly is an\naverage IC student. Most people\nhave their own ideas about this\nmythical being but there are few\nfigures to prove these opinions. We\nhope to be able to confirm or deny\nthe traditional view of IC students.\nThe survey will be conducted by\nthe Welfare Committee in\nassociation with Student Services by\nsending out confidential question aires to a representative\ncross-section of students. Names of\nrecipients will be selected by a random process and the\nquestion aire forms will not carry\nany means of identifying those\npeople. Envelopes for the return of\ncompleted forms will be provided\nand secure boxes for posting the\nenvelopes will be situated at\nstrategic places in College. In\naddition, arrangements will be\nmade for questionnaires to be\nreturned via the internal mail service\nAssociated with the questionnaire\nto encourage your enthusiastic\nparticipation will be a raffle for a variety of goodies. So remember, if\nyour name is picked out you will be\nhelping both yourself and your\nUnion while expending very little\neffort indeed.\nForms will be sent out on the first\nday of next term to allow you plenty\nof time to complete them. The\nresults will be published in FELIX\nonce they have been processed and\nhopefully they will provide the basis\nof discussions for a while to come.\nLastly I must point out that this\nquestionnaire is purely voluntary\nbut the importance of the\ninformation it will provide cannot\nbe underestimated. I must re-emphasise that replies will be\ncompletely confidential in all\nrep ect s and that you can only\nbenefit by taking part.\nMark Cottle\nRag Week '86\nRag Week has come and gone and\nas Rag Weeks go this has been one\nof the most successful.\nIt started on Wednesday 12th November with a new (clean?)\nversion of Morphy Day. And so it\nwas that the three CCU presidents\nset off down Putney High Street\nwith the aim of chatting up a non-IC\ngirl and taking her for tea in\nHarrods. Small but perfectly\nformed Duncan Royle was\nresplendent with posh suit,\ncarnation, champagne and bow tie\nwhilst all but perfectly-formed\nSimon Singh tried to tempt the\nladies with a kit kat and those yellow\nshorts. Rob Perry was last seen in a bar with others of the RSM Exec. In\nthe end Simon was the first\npresident past the post after picking\nup the amazing Tracey from\nRoehampton Institute although he\nwas narrowly beaten by Guildsman\nSimon Childs who reached Harrods\nfive minutes earlier.\nDue to indecision on Man Tai's part, some drinkers didn't turn up to\nThe Norfolk\u2014the pub chosen for\n\"Drink-a pub-Dry\" that night\u2014\nbut to a completely different\nestablishment. All the same we\nmanaged to reduce them to half a barrel of lager before the landlord\nrealised what was happening and\nstopped serving us, at 10.30 pm.\nThe hypnosis lecture brought the\nlargest attendance since it started\nseven years ago. One hundred and\nfifty of the audience volunteered to\nbe hypnotised and of these, eight\nwere kept back for further\nem barras ment. They were made to\ndo silly things like see a hippopotamus walking across the\nstage, when with perfect timing,\nMan Tai walked through a side door\n(hippo-potato-mus?).\nFriday was the Guild's carnival\u2014a brilliant event, that\nwould have been even better had\nmore of you turned up.\nI can't remember much of\nSaturday but I am told I enjoyed\nSouthside's cocktails...\nYes, I did get up for the Raft Race\nthe next morning, and it was won\nmost convincingly by Guilds.\nSunday evening was Chaps Curry\nand Barnite which was very poorly\nattended\u2014perhaps everyone was\nstill recovering from the Raft Race?\n(or cocktails?)\nA lot of dirty people\nturned out\nfor the RSM Dirty Disco on\nMonday, but the highlight of the\nnight was definitely Julian's streak\nround the Queen's Tower.\nWednesday's Beer Festival, as\nusual, was the most successful Rag\nevent; in fact, some people enjoyed\nit so much that they didn't want to\nleave. In the end we carried them out\nand cleaned up\u2014thanks folks, the\nJCR never looked cleaner than it did\nthe next morning.\nThe Smoking Concert on\nThursday was a chance for various\npeople who should have known\nbetter to show what talent (or lack\nof it) they possessed. The most\nnotable of these were Fiona's poem\n(which won the \"Best Act\"), the\nChaps Sketch, the Guilds Exec, and\nthe the inevitable Guilds Rugby.\nChas Brereton also resurfaced\nhaving completed his 48 hour piano\nmarathon a week before, and played\nat the Carnival and the Beer\nFestival. (Is there no limit to this\nman's enthusiasm?)\nFriday, and the RS M actually\nwon an event:-true, it was the Boat\nRace, but it's better than nothing. In\nthe evening we had Rag and Dragthe most colourful party of the\nweek. Imagination had run riot, and\nsome men had really gone to town\non their dresses. Someone who shall\nremain nameless (called Nigel) liked\nhis dress so much he wore it to\nlectures on Monday.\nSCAB night was a very cultured\nway to end Rag week, and showed\nhow much talent there really is in IC\nThe magnificent Trombone Trio\nreceived the most thunderous\napplause, and a close second was\nDebsoc's debate\u2014\"This house\nproposes that Wombles are the\nzenith of creation.\" Both sides\nspoke convincingly but the motion\nwas almost unanimously carried.\nRag Week officially finished with\nSCAB Night but the dedicated\n\"1,000,001 darts\" players kept\ngoing until Monday to score\n1,000,001.\nSo there it was\u2014Rag Week 1986.\nI hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did, and many, many thanks to\neveryone who helped in every way.\nA special thanks though to the Rag\npublicity team, the Rag Committee\nand the organisers of the Beer\nFestival and Carnival.

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Wednesday December 10th19862 Anthem For\nDoomed\nYouth\nDear Dave\nThree years ago I was a young,\nkeen geo physicist with a four-year\ndegree and three year's industrial\nexperience behind me. As I wanted\nto work in research, and had an\ninteresting project I wished to work\non, I came to Imperial College to do\na PhD.\nIn the three years I have been\nhere, I have come to know a lot of\npeople\u2014undergraduates and\npostgraduates, spread across most\ndepartments of the College. Like\nme, they were mostly young, and\nmostly keen to become geologists or\nphysicists or mechanical engineers.\nNow I find that I have a friend\nwith a first in physics who is\nworking as an accountant; two\nfriends with degrees in mechanical\nengineering who have no intention\nof ever working as mechanical\nengineers; a number of friends\ntrying to complete PhDs in geology\nfor which they have totally lost\ninterest; and the list could continue.\nI myself am on the verge of giving up\nmy PhD, only six months from\ncompletion, because I am tired of\nthe constant struggle to get anything\ndone, of the barriers that const andy appear before me. I have no\nintention of working as a geo physicist again.\nWhat has happened to the young,\nkeen people?\nIs Imperial College really doing\nthe best possible job for Science and\nTechnology?\nYours sincerely,\nGraham Oakes\nGreat Dons\nOf Today\nDear Dave,\nI am writing in reply to Steven\nMercer's letter ( FELIX756) concerning Hamlet Gardens. Mr.\nMercer seems to have been\nmisinformed.\nI have contacted the landlords'\nagents, through whom all the flats at\nHamlet Gardens are let. They tell\nme that the flat to which Mr. Mercer\nrefers, which is in the basement, is in\nfact a flat for only five. Space in\nwhat used to be a double room has\nbeen blocked off in order to create a corridor to the cellar, thus making it\na single. Mr. Mercers' is a normal\nsix-person flat.\nFurthermore, I am told that the\nrent being charged for the basement\nflat is in fact \u00a3150 per week\u2014rather\nmore, per person, than we are\ncharging Mr. Mercer and his\nflat mates. It is true that the fla across from\nMr. Mercer's is being let at a lower\nrate. This is because it is unfurnished\nand has been let to the same person\nfor a number of years on a protected\ntenancy, which prevents the rent\nbeing raised by more than a little\neach year.\nWe asked the landlord to improve\nthe security arrangements as soon as\nwe heard there was a problem. They\nreacted quickly in installing locks\nand spring returns. New\nentry phones, though, are expensive\nand need to be costed before\ninstallation. This takes time.\nPending installation of the\nentry phones, the new locks were put\non the latch. On discovering the\nlocks, though, some of the\noccupants of the flats activated\nthem and some others kicked down\nthe now-locked door. To prevent\nfurther vandalism, we temporarily\nsuspended the locking of the doors\nand Mr. Mercer complained. It\nseems we can't win!\nAs far as keys are concerned, I can\nonly apologise on behalf of the\nlandlords if there has been any mix-up concerning their issue. I will\npursue the matter with them. I understand that the situation has\nbeen fully remedied.\nI am confident that Mr. Mercer,\nnow in full possession of the facts of\nthe matter, is in a better position to\nappreciate the College's rent\nstructure and policies. If not, I would be more than happy to meet\nhim and explain them to him. I hope\nthis clears up any mis under stan ding.\nYours ever,\nDon Ferguson\nStudent Services Officer\nWhen I Were\nA Lad....\nDear David,\nAfter last week's issue and its\narticle about my Dad's garage I thought it time that I wrote in and\nexplained generally how that story\nwas born.\nWhilst I was sitting on my first\nUndergraduate Studies Committee\none of the first items to get through\nwas that of paying departments a sum' of money from the fund\ncontrolled by the committee to\nallow them to send lecturers away\non courses. These courses would be\naimed at improving their knowledge\nof their courses or improving their\nlecture technique, or hopefully both.\nNow silly little me thought that the\nmoney the Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee was paying departments\nwould go to bringing in a replacement; apparently this is not\nso (quoted from the aforementioned\ncommittee meeting). So I then asked\nthat if the money was just going to a Department as an incentive\npayment, why should we need to do\nthis at all. Surely it is in every\nDepartment's best interest to keep\nits lecturing staff up-to-date as\npossible.\nThis is where the lesson according\nto my Dad's garage comes in: My\nDad used to work for a garage\nwhich employed fitters, sales staff\nand receptionists. As was the\ntradition in those days, each Works\ntrained some apprentices in\ncombination with lectures from the\nlocal Tech. Also, before each new\nrange of cars came out garages who\nsold the cars of this make were\ninvited to send staff on a familiaris ation course, for a small\nsum of course. This meant that the\nfitters could mend the new cars\nbefore they came out, a bonus in a competitive world such as ours.\nHowever, the recession hit and\ngarages were no freer from its effects\nthan any other industry, the first\nthings to be cut were those that\nrequired outlay before profit, i.e. the\ncontinuing education process.\nAs I said, my Dad used to work in\na garage.\nApplying the moral of this story\nto Imperial College, Departments\nshouldn't be saying \"what's in it for\nme\", they should be insisting that all\nlecturers be continually trained and\neducated because in the long run\nthat is what people will notice, and\nin the long run that is what will save\nthis College from the acts of any\ngovernment and perhaps the staff\nhere will never have to say I used to\nwork in a University.\nI hope this di spells any thoughts\nof premature senility that the author\nof last week's third hand story was\ntoying with.\nDave Colley\nHon. Secretary\nThe One We\nHad To Print\nDear David,\nI am about to leave the College\nafter nearly thirty years looking\nafter the College archives, and\nwould like to express my\nappreciation of the help that\nstudents of the College have given to\nthe archives office. It would not\nhave been possible to undertake so\nmany exhibitions, displays, and the\norganisation of professional and\nprivate functions without this\nassistance. FELIX editors and staff\nhave been particularly helpful, first\nof all yourself, for doing so much\nartwork for the Great Queen's Tower project, and among previous\neditors Pallab Ghosh, Mark Smith,\nHugh Southey and especially David\nRowe who also has this marvelous\ntalent for appearing at exactly the\nright moment with a bottle of\nchampagne. I shall never forget also\nhow Steve Marshall's farewell issue\ncheered me at a very black moment\nin life. Two former chairmen of the\nSocial Clubs Committee, Dr. Frank\nJames and Robin Graham were of\nimmense help to me. Last but not\nleast I am most grateful to that well\nknown FELIX contributor and ex\nUnion President, SD Goulder, the\nperfect major-do mo. As a member\nof the FELIX Club I hope I will see\nsomething of you all in the future.\nVIVAT ET FLOREAT FELIX!\nJ Pingree\nNUS Debate:\nNo Case For\nReaffiliation\nDear Dave,\nWhat could IC possibly gain from\njoining the NUS? What would we\nget in exchange for the valuable\nclubs which we would have to\nsacrifice to join that organisation?\nIf, as you say, ICU has an opinion to\nexpress (and the question here is not\nwhether it does or not), does it need\nto a member of the NUS to express\nit? Surely not. Has the NUS not\nproven itself to be the most\ninefficient student organization in\nGreat Britain? Any organisation\nthat spends 90% of its budget on its\nannual conference (leaving only\n10% for possible worthwhile\nactivities which may have a slightly\nhigher chance improving our lot as\nUniversity students) cannot\nhonestly claim to be doing its best\nfor the students it supposedly\nrepresents. What are the NUS's most outstanding achievements so\nfar? The only one I can think of is\none that has lasted 7 years\u2014since\n1979 they have sat idly by, watching\nstudents' grants as they are reduced\nmore and more in real terms. What\nhave they done to try to prevent\nthis? Nothing. Not only has the NUS\ndone nothing for Joe (or Jane)\nstudent, it has actually done more to\ndamage the public image of students\nthan any other organisation. It is\nthey who have given the public the\nidea that a university student is\nautomatically some kind of ultra-left wing dirty hippy who spends all\nhis time going on protest marches\ninstead of staying at home and\nstudying, and who spends all his\ngrant money (which was provided\nby the tax-payers) on nose-rings and\nhair dye. This is the image we\nUniversity students have, and we\nhave the NUS to thank for it. Let us\nask ourselves again, what would we\npossibly gain by joining the NUS?\nYours sincerely,\nll astair Seymour\n\n"

However,\ndue to the rules of the competition,\nthey were unable to compete further\nand this prevented a possible all-London final.\nFive teams were in the second\ngroup including the three strongest\nin the country. UL started well with\nemphatic victories over the weaker\nteams of Nottingham, 4\u20140, and\nSheffield, 4\u20141. After this, the\ngames became a lot more tense, and\nwith strong defences, scoring\nbecame a lot harder.\nThe next game, against Oxford,\nwas very tight but UL eventually\nstruggled to victory, 3\u20142, mainly\ndue to better long range shooting.\nThis led to a group-deciding match\nagainst arch-rivals Brighton which\nwas won 2\u20141 after an all-out effort\nfor revenge following last week's defeat.\nA joint Lancaster and York team\nwere the opponents in the semi final,\nand after taking an early 1\u20140 lead,\nthey seemed capable of holding UL to this score until two well worked\nplays in the last three minutes both\nproduced goals and hence gave\nvictory to UL, 2\u20141.\nThe final was a rematch against\nOxford who had thrashed their\nsemi-final opponents. Both defences\nplayed tight, controlled ko rfb all and\nneither side seemed capable of\nscoring. With only five minutes left,\nthe referee awarded a very dubious\npenalty to Oxford, and when scored\nit seemed to have settled the match.\nBut after an excellent long range\nequalise r from UL, the Oxford\ndefence seemed to fall apart and UL\nscored again to win the match, and\ntournament, 2\u20141.\nIn the three tournaments entered\nthis term, UL have won two and\nbeen losing finalists in the other.\nTeam.-Russel Norton, David\nFinnaey, Takis Frontizis, Jacky\nKnowles, Kate Duley, Paul Stahl,\nBrian Gubner, Matt Reckamp, Ian\nCraig, Catherine Porter, Helen\nGrinyer, Karen Wilden, Penny\nSharp.\nUL is losing several players after\nChristmas and so needs new players\n(no experience necessary) to join the\nclub. Would anyone interested, male\nor female, contact D. Finney (Physics\n1) or R. Norton (Chem Eng 2) via the\npigeonholes.\nBadminton\nSuccesses\nIn UAU\nIn the last two weeks badminton\nplayers from IC have achieved two\nremarkable victories in ladies and\nmixed doubles.\nThe most notable victory came\nlast weekend when the badminton\nclub sent a team to represent the\nCollege at the U AU Individuals\nChampionships. Robin Martin and\nJulie Goodeve stormed through to\nthe Ladies Doubles Final by\ncrushing anything that stood in their\nway. In the quarter finals they easily\nbeat Loughborough's first pair, who\nboasted half of last years winners,\n15:6 15:2, and in the semi-final they\nannihilated the number two seeds\nfrom Sheffield 15:2, 15:1.\nThe final, against another\nunseeded pair from Birmingham,\nwas a closer and tougher match but\nthe IC pair were never in any real\ntrouble. They won the title 15:12,\n15:10.\nThere were other good\nperformances that weekend, again\nfeaturing Robin and Julie. In the\nmixed doubles Robin reached the\nquarter finals with Sean Mulshaw,\nand Julie reached the last 16 with\nGraham Scott. In the Ladies singles\nSue Yates played extremely well to\nreach the last 16 and only narrowly\nlost 11:8 11:6 to miss out on the\nquarter final.\nIt was a memorable weekend.\nThe other success took place the\nweek before in the Hammersmith\nand District Badminton Tournaments. Four pairs from IC took\npart\u2014two in both the mens and\nmixed doubles. The standard of\nbadminton was pretty good and\nalthough three pairs did not qualify\nfor the semi finals, it was Robin\nMartin and Sean Mulshaw that\nfound themselves in the semi finals\nof the mixed.\nThat match proved to be the most\ntesting game all day. Having built\nup a commanding lead the\nopposition then began a comeback,\nand little by little the lead was\nreduced. However, the IC pair kept\ntheir composure and won the game\n21:16.\nIn the final it was a similar story.\nHaving easily won the first game\n15:4 (the best of three match) the\nsecond game was conceded 15:10.\nThe deciding game was considerably closer but Robin and Sean\nmanaged to clinch the title 15:12.\nAt the second meeting of the\nLondon Colleges ski league, we\nenjoyed some good racing against\ntough opposition. The Imperial first\nteam, Victor Misawa, Kate Finch,\nIvor Gillbe, Mark Schmidt and\nMike Johnston, reached the final\nonly to be narrowly beaten by UCL.\nOur other two teams had a good\nevening's racing coming slightly\nlower down the results.\nThe team played in the South East\nU AU tournament at Essex\nUniversity on Saturday 15th of\nNovember in Colchester. Despite\nthis being the first time the team had\nplayed together we performed well\nand, with some luck, could have\nqualified for the knock out stage of\nthe tournament.\nWe played 3 games and won 1.\nThe first two games, against Kent\nand the home team Essex, we lost\nnarrowly by 55\u201459 and 56\u201460. In\nIn the past few weeks we've had\nthree matches and not surprisingly\nwe didn't win one. However, in the\ntwo against Southhampton we had\nmoral victories. That is we scored\npoints for the first time this season.\nThis first match was a5 \u20145 draw\nthat we should have won whilst the\nsecond was lost 8\u20142 after we looked\nlike getting a draw. The worst\nperformance of the week was by\nCapital Coaches on Wednesday\nwhen they turned up seventy\nminutes late. This meant that when\nDespite the racing debut of our\nClub Treasurer, Clare Murphy, we\nstill need female skiers to complete\nthe teams.' So if there are any good\nfemale skiers who wish to race,\ncontact us through the union pigeon\nholes or come to one of our\nmeetings.\nNext race is in the Spring Term on\nSaturday 17th January at Hemel\nHempstead.\nour final game we beat Surrey by\n44\u201433.\nIt was a good performance and\nwe were unfortunate to lose two\ngames by such a small margin.\nOur first league game was played\nagainst UCL on Thursday 27th. the\ngame was very competitive but we\nalways had the edge over UCL and\nafter we weathered a period of\nintense UCL pressure in the second\nhalf, we were comfortable winners\nby 76\u201474.\nwe arrived at Tolworth we had\nalready lost the match 10\u20140.\nSpecial mentions go to Paul\nGaines, Andy Rayner and Nicky\nFletcher for service beyond the call\nof duty.\nThere is no bowling for the rest of\nthe year but next term bowling will\nstart again on the second\nWednesday. If you've never come\nbowling before then now is the time\nto start because you'll have your\ngrant cheque waiting to be spent.\nBasketball\nBasketball Blues\nTen Pin Bowling\nBowlers' Bad Patch\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews. FELIX, Wednesday December 10th198616 Theatre\nThe Shadow Syndicate: Blood Of\nAngels: The Ideal Christmas Party?\nIt is hard to know how to start\nreviewing Blood of Angels by the\nShadow Syndicate. There is no\nsingle thing one can say that gets to\nthe bottom of this strange play.\nAnyone who is unsure just how\ninnovative and powerful fringe\ntheatre can be should try to catch\nthis play before Christmas. It is\nbreathtaking.\nOn the outside it sounds a little\npreposterous: Oscar Wilde's Salome; light 50's music, prophecy,\nintrigue. It sounds like a vague\nmelee of unconnected ideas but it is\nnothing of the sort.\nInstead we are treated to a play\nthat has been constructed with great\nintelligence and the utmost in\nimagination. Wilde's risky 'Salome'\n(too hot for the English stage to\nhandle in its time) is the key or\ninterior. The exterior is a setting of\nthe 1950's complete with the band\nevocative music of that period.\nThere is a similar duality in these\ntwo as the plot unfolds,\ninvestigating the characters and\ntheir relationships in a bizarre\nprobing ritual manner that involves\nthe acting of Salome. The\nel7 programme notes describe this as a surreal therapy session.\nEverything is provocatively\nshrouded in vagueness and\n'un clarity' where strong currents of\nportentous prophesy flow\nunderneath. The high drama is\narresting, heightened by in gene o us techniques all serving to extend the\nfrontiers of what is taking place in\nthe small room.\nTo single out actors would be\npointless, the production is very\nmuch a 'syndicate' production.\nEach of them communicates a haunting scene of what they are\ndoing. Whether the audience\nunderstands or not they seem to\ntotally understand the esoteric\nnature of their play. Credit for its\nconception goes to Jon Pope and\nPeter Granger Taylor, the latter also\nwriting recent Syncicate hit 'Between\nthe Devil and the Deep Blue Sea'.\nYou would not be disappointed in\nthis play. From the moment you are\nushered into the small theatre until\nthe moment you leave you will be\nwitness to a production of total\ntheatricality. The adjective 'camp'\ncould be applied if you wished but\nnot in any derogatory sense\u2014more\nin envy of the brilliantly devious\nminds who created this stage flight\nof the imagination.\nMcNeil\n***\nRecords\nHaving proved what a successful\nstyle Spandau Ballet have, their\nrecord label would obviously be\nrequesting more of the same, but the\nmaterial needs to slightly different\nfrom previous albums, which I believe that on 'Through the\nBarricades' is, for the most part.\nLittle has changed in the musical\narrangement; we still hear the crisp\nand always-in-tune lead vocals,\ninterspersed with the ubiquitous\nsax, but the guitar on 'Cross the\nLine' is that little bit heavier, and on\nseveral tracks, the melody is much\nmore adventurous, and less\n'formula'. The songs are all pretty\nlong, and most have one of those\nquiet 'take-a rest' bits half way\nthrough, which is particularly\neffective on 'Man in Chains', with\nthe bongos in the background.\nPossibly the strongest tracks other\nthan the title are 'How Many Lies',\nX with an OMD-like vocal hum intro\nleading into a slow, but powerful\nsounding track, and 'Swept', which\nis a quieter ballad-type number,\nwith plenty of acoustic piano.\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood on\nthe other hand, have been so\nincredibly successful that they stand\nlittle chance of maintaining the\nfantastic success they so quickly\nfound. The songs on their\n'Liverpool' album are in general a lot better thought out before they\nreach the Trevor Horn big sound\ndepartment than was the case on the\nlast LP, but somehow have lost that\ncult appeal. With one exception,\n'Watching the Wildlife', the tracks\nare the same combination of driving\nbeat/bass and big-sound synth\nChorus that go down well on radio\nand in discos, although you can't easily dance to 'For Heaven's Sake',\nleaving little else to recommend it.\nHowever, the acoustic piano on\n'Watching the Wildlife' does a lot to\nsoften the sound, and is a real\nexample of rhythmic music, rather\nthan musical rh y thy m. Bucks Fizz have spent five years\ntrying live down the fact that they\nwon Eurovision, and would have\nsucceeded with their current album,\n'Writing on the Wall', if it wasn't for\nthe 'two men, two women, all sing\ntogether' format of their cho russes which is a dead giveaway of their\nkinship with the unspeakable\nSwedish quartet. Their current\nsound is characterised by modern\nsounding digital percussion, and\nquite strong solo vocals during the\nverses, and a few new ideas, such as\nthe harmonica on 'The Company\nyou Keep', which also includes the\nsoul-type bass that Paul Young\nrecord's always used to feature.\n'Love in a World gone Mad'\nactually sounds quite 5-star like in\nparts, but despite their efforts, I don't think they're sufficiently\ndetached from 'Making your mind\nup' to appeal to a wider audience.\nMy favourite track was 'Magical'\nwhich is rhythmically very strong, in\nfact several tracks could stand up in\na disco well if it weren't for peoples\npre-conceptions.\nFinally, check-out that\nindescribable Christmas record\nfrom the Baron-Knights.\nDick P Canary\nE \u00a35\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nBack By Unpopular Demand, it's. TTjE BftROR\ner\nIn a distant corner of Cheapskate\nIan Whygate sat planning his latest\npublicity stunt with his two dumb\nhelpers, GMT( who was so stupid\nthat he was still in the first class at\nCheapskate infant school) and\nCustard Johnson. Whygate had a very clever plan. He and GMT and\nCustard were going to creep around\nall of the citizens dormitories in the\nmiddle of the night and leave\ncardboard cut-outs of Whygate\ninside all the rooms which were\nunlocked. Whygate giggled and\nthought how clever he was. He\nwanted to be next year's head citizen\nin Cheapskate, and was carefully\nplanning how he would takeover\nfrom the current head citizen, Ms\nPlague. Whygate was easily the best\nperson to be the citizen's leader as he\nhad been to more committee\nmeetings than anyone else, and was\nvery good at running out crying in\norder to get a lot of attention. In\nparticular, he was much better at\ntalking a lot than Alan Ego, the,\nother candidate for the post of next\nyear's head citizen\nCustard, meanwhile, was getting\nbored with Ian Whygate's plans. He\ndid not like the idea of following\nWhygate around with several\nhundred cardboard cut-outs, and\ndecided to go and find his friend,\nKettle, to go for a drink in Northend\nBar. As usual when he wanted to\nfind Kettle, Custard rang the\nFALLIX Office. \"Is Kettle there\",\nsaid Custard when FALLIX Editor\nRabid Bones picked up the phone.\n\"Piss Off, Custard!\", said Rabid\nand slammed the phone down.\nRabid was not in a good mood. He\nwas in disgrace after falling asleep\nwhilst having tea with Mr and Mrs\nTSB, the chancellor of Cheapskate\nand his wife, at the Baron's Castle.\nHe did not like people using his\nbrand new office, including his staff,\nand as usual was having an\nargument with his Fairy Stories\nEditor, Willhebe Goodforacolumninch. Willhebe was drunk, after\ngoing to the Belgium Club to find\nsome fairy stories. He had been\nspeaking to John Verycamp, the\nleader of one of Cheapskate's bands\nof elves, who always seemed to tell\nWillhebe a lot of fairy stories about\nhimself. Willhebe was confused. He\ndid not under t and why Rabid did\nnot want him to write a story about\nhow good John Verycamp was at\ngardening. Rabid sighed and\ndisappeared into the Print Room for\nhalf a hour to clean the Printing\nPress with Judith Largeamounts.\nMeanwhile in the Citizens' office,\nBigbum, the Citizens' Chairman,\nwas sitting on Mummylonglegs'\nknee. Mummylonglegs was the\nDeputy leader of the citizens and\nwas in charge of the office while Ms\nPlague was busy playing with\nHamster. Bigbum was sucking his\nthumb and wailing \"me want\ncuddle\" at regular intervals.\nMummylonglegs was trying to talk\nto McNorthey, the Chief cook in\nCheapskate. She explained that she\nwanted him to give her his new\n\"Quite Tasty\" burger factory which\nwas making lots of money for the\nBaron's coffers, but McNorthey just\nlaughed and gave Mummylonglegs\na sixpence for the citizens' Rug\ncollection. \"But it's my room\",\nshrieked Mummylonglegs, banging\nher fist on the table, and spilling a cup of coffee all over Bigbum who\nstarted to cry.\nAt that moment Ms Plague\nrushed back into the Office, pushing\naside Gutters, the Citizens' Head\nBouncer, on her way in. She ran to\nthe phone and dialled the number.\nfor Dong, Fergie & Son, the\nCheapskate Rent Collector. \"Hello,\ncan I help you?\" said Dong sleepily\nwhen he answered the phone,\nwaking from his afternoon nap.\n\"You idiot\", screamed Ms Plague,\n\"you've given the citizens a house\nwith no roof!\"\n\"Does it have four walls and a floor, though?\" replied Dong,\nalways on the defensive whenever\nMs Plague rang him.\n\"Don't argue, fix it immediately!\" ordered Ms Plague. \"I'm going to ring the Baron's wife\".\nWith that she slammed the phone\ndown.\nDong was worried. He went\ndownstairs to see Hardlyworthit,\nthe Cheapskate House Builder.\nHardlyworthit was very busy. He\nhad had lots of complaints about his\nhouses but couldn't get any of his\nstaff to mend anything. \"I know\",\nsaid Hardlyworthit, \"we can get\nWhygate to mend all the houses.\nJust give him a hammer and some\nnails.\"\n\"Super\", said Dong and went\nback to finish his afternoon nap. His\npeace was short lived, though. No\nsooner had he got back to his\ncomfortable office than the phone\nrang again. Dong leapt to attention\nwhen he heard the Baron's voice\nover the phone. We'd like to come\nand have a look around your office,\nDong\", said Derek Dash, the new\nBaron. Dong shuddered. The Baron\nHimself was bad enough, but this\ntime Derek was bringing his\neccentric wife, Mad Dash. Dong\nbegan to clear up his office but\nbefore he could collect all the coffee\ncups his phone rang yet again. This\ntime it was Arthur Michael, the\ngood but not very useful fairy. \"The\nBaron's coming to see you now\",\nchuckled Arthur Michael, gleefully.\nDong looked about him and\ngroaned. He could tell it was a Tuesday\nWill Dong get a dressing down\nfrom the Baron\nWill Willhebe Goodforacolumninch\never sober up?\nWill CustardfindKettle?\nWill John Secretary appear in the\nnext instalment?\nFind out in the next episode of\n\"The Baron Of Cheapskate\"\nUNION BAR\nWINTER ALES WEEK\nWednesday 10th Martson's: Old Roger\nThursday 11th Whitbread's: Winter Royal\nEvenings\nISSUE OF GRANT CHEQUES Please note that Postgraduate and Undergraduate grant\ncheques will not be available for collection until the second\nday of next term, Tuesday 6th January 1987.

Imperial College has one of the two offices in the\nSouth West London area, which is used by 40 students every day.\nFELIX interviewed Mark Fletcher, assistant sales manager for\nSouth West London, who described the service STA is able to\noffer.\nIn an effort to provide the type of\ntravel service students need, STA try\nto employ staff who have travelled\nextensively \" in the student\nmanner\". Prior to taking up his\ncurrent job, Mr Fletcher spent a year in South America after\nworking on land surveying projects\nin Iraq. The office staff can always\nfind information about travelling\nabroad\u2014if they haven't visited your\ndestination themselves they can\neasily phone up someone who has.\nSTA are offer significant\ndiscounts on fares for students, and\ncan be up to 50% cheaper than their\ncompetitors. The service is flexible,\nallowing you to alter your timetable\nwhere necessary, and unlike bucket\nshops, ST A is government\nbacked\u2014should the organisation\ncollapse, your ticket would still be\nhonoured. Discounts are available\non, for example, general airline\ntickets, National Express coach\nservices in the UK, fen\" crossings\nand as a greyhound tickets. There\nare also special offers, such as a trip\naround the world for \u00a3800.\nBecause STA has offices all over\nthe world it is easy to change routes\nand it is also feasible to use the\noffices abroad as mail boxes. For\nsome trips it is necessary to book\nwell in advance, and fares are in\ngeneral very seasonal.\nThe office at IC attracts business\nfrom other colleges in the area, such\nas the RCA. Earlier this year the\noffice was moved from its old\nposition on the JCR to a new site\nwith a direct entrance from the\nSherfield walkway. As a result trade\nhas increased and academic staff are\nnow beginning to use the office. IC\nUnion benefits directly from STA-it\nreceives a rent payment of 1% of the\noffice turnover, with a minimum of\n\u00a32,500. In addition STA sponsor\nsome Union events, such as the offer\nof a holiday for two in Paris at last\nyear's Rag Fete (won by ex-FELIX\nEditor Hugh Southey). There are\nalso regular adverts in FELIX and\nthe Union Handbook.\nThe IC office has two permanent\nmembers of staff; Suzie Roberts\n(Manager) and Lesley Hing. The\noffice is open throughout the\nsummer period and can now be\nphoned internally on 3906. For\ngroup trips students should contact\nthe main branch in Old Brompton\nRoad, telephone 581 4751.\nTales from\nthe Holland\nClub\nby Nigel Hamster\nWhen Union plaything Hugh\nSouthey decided to stand for a sabbatical post at the end of the\nthird year of his four year Chemical\nEngineering Course, several people\nsuggested he would have difficulty\ngetting used to academic work\nagain. Heroic Hugh appears to have\nproved everyone wrong, however,\nand has rediscovered his enthusiasm\nfor the subject. At the same time he\nhas been unable to fade gracefully\naway from the Union scene. At the\nUnion Planning Group two weeks\nago, Hugh proudly presented his\nmaster plan to save IC Union; with\ntwelve people around the table he\nsuggested that three working parties\nbe set up to look into different\naspects of Union affairs. Each group\nshould have, he explained, three or\nfour members so that they would be\nable to \"meet regularly\" and \"act\nswiftly\" (three timed four equals\ntwelve\u2014brilliant, Hugh!). Hugh has\nnot fully recovered from eight weeks\nwith ICI over the summer, where he\ndiscovered what a working party\nwas and decided that IC Union\nneeded one or two. Stunned by\nHuge's mind-blowing plan, the rest\nof the assembled cross section of the\nUnion office spent the next half an\nhour deciding who should sit on\nwhat working party and what\nexactly each party should be\nresponsible for. At the end of\nJanuary, each working party (after a lot of \"acting swiftly\") is going to\nreport back to the omnipotent UPG\nwhich will then report to Council,\nwhere all the people who sat on the\nworking parties will decide if they\nwant to do anything. A bureaucrats'\nparadise\u2014fantastic!\nEver-popular Refectory Manager\nRob Northey rarely misses an\nopportunity to boost his profits.\nEarlier this term honest Rob\npersuaded the shift engineers to turn\nup the heating in Southside, in order\nto drag more custom down to the\nbar. Since then Rob has been doing\nhis best to gain a reputation as a College nice guy. After the RCS beer\nfestival he approached one of the\norganisers and handed over \u00a360\u2014a share of the enormous profit he had\nmade from the \"QT\" snack bar\nduring the day. Being such a benevolent character, he added a condition that this act of altruism\nshould be mentioned in the pages of\nFELIX\u2014I hope he's satisfied.\nFELIX has not said very much\nabout the College's new accounting\nsystem, which was introduced at the\nbeginning of August. Though\nSherfield was in chaos for several\nweeks, it was impossible to find\nanyone who would admit that\nanything was amiss. \"Problems with\nthe finance system? Don't know\nwhat you mean. Everything's okay\nhere-just a few teething troubles in\nthe first few days, but you expect\nthat when you make as major a change- as this.\" The teething\ntroubles included one member of\nstaff resigning in despair a few days\nafter the system was introduced, but\notherwise, no problems. Yes,\nTerry\u2014tell it to the Marines!\n\n"

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday November 28th19866 On Wednesday November 27th Alan Charig and\nAngela Milner of the Natural History Museum finally\nannounced details of a new type of dinosaur. The\nFELIX Geology division, headed by Kamala Sen,\nwent to investigate.\nClaws\n'Claws' has at last been offical ly christened. Her (or his) real name is\nnow Baryonyx walkeri, say the\nexperts, and she's the founding\nmember of a new dinosaur family,\nBaryonychidae.\nThree years, you might think, is a long time to take deciding what to\ncall a set of old bones. For it was in\n1983 that a plumber and eager\namateur fossil hunter, William\nWalker, stumbled over the first\ntraces in a clay pit in Surrey. The\nfoot-long claw he found hinted at\ndrama and fury in the prehistoric\nworld, and at further dramatic\nrevelations to come. It's been a long\nwait for more news.\nBut to me it's a miracle that the\ncreature has been classified in less\nthan a decade. Think it's hard\nputting together the sky on a jigsaw\npuzzle? You should have a go at this\njigsaw.

She (or he) is lying in what\nmust be hundreds of thousands of\npieces over this disaster area. A closer look, however, shows that the\nchaos is organised. A few larger\nbones stand out\u2014notably the\nhumerus and a couple of pieces of\njawbone which add up to a metre-long snout (almost as long as that of\nthe notorious Tyrannosaurus rex).\nA few lumps of rock stand about\nwith half-revealed ribs or shin-bones\nslanting out like modem sculpture.\nThe rest of 'Claws' consists of\nfragments of jagged, dull grey-brown stone that even a highly\ntrained geology student would walk\nby without a second glance, and\nhandfuls of sand at the bottom of\ncardboard boxes.\nSomehow, over the three years\nsince she was dug out, patient hands\nhave put the myriad pieces of the\npuzzle together into individual ribs,\ntoes, and other small bones. Even\nthe tiniest of these are cobweb bed with the lines of plaster showing that\nat least six shards fit together to\nform an inch of bone, paper thin as\nit is. Among the success stories\nstand the boxes for which nothing\ncan be done, those pieces which are\ntoo badly distorted to be teased\ngently back into shape.\nEven before the fitting-together\nenormous amounts of care, skill and\nplanning have gone into the project.\nPalaeontologists may be strange\ncreatures, but they're not\ncompletely crazy: they didn't work\nin the cold and wet, under the tracks\nof the encroaching bulldozers, for\nthree years, digging out bone by\nbone. Fossil hunting has gone high tech \u2014expanding polyurethane\nfoam (which, incidentally, gives off\ntoxic fumes when made) was used\nwith plaster to encase the 'semi-continuous series of irregular stone\nblocks'\u2014two van loads full of\nthem\u2014found in the vicinity of the\nclaw. Hardly any bone could be seen\nin these except where the bulldozers\nhad scraped by, but their positions\nwere mapped before they were\ntransported back to the lab. Only\nthere could the side ri tic siltstone\u2014that is, muds cemented\ntogether with iron carbonate\u2014be\nbroken away to reveal the secrets of\nthe animal.

Amazingly, 'Claws' has\nremained almost intact through the\nmillions of years.

    "content": "FELIX, Wednesday December 10th198620 Imperial College has recently\nbecome part of LIVE-NET, one\nof the world's first academic\ninteractive video networks.\nBritish Telecom approached\nthe University of London with\na partly developed network\nsystem, which they offered to\nthe University free of charge\n(temporarily) in return for its\nfurther development.\nThe University became\nformally involved with the\nproject in March of this year.\nIn October the hardware\nstarted arriving, and IC,\nUniversity College and Senate\nHouse were connected up in\ntime for the 'Science for\nIndustry' Exhibition. Kings\nCollege came on line more\nrecently, and it is hoped that\nQueen Mary College, Royal\nHolloway and Bedford New\nCollege, and the University of\nLondon Computer Centre will\nbe connected in the new year.\n\"the real question Is\ngoing to be whether the\nUniversity gets enough\nreal use out of the system\nto make Its development\nworthwhile\"\nThose who attended the\nexhibition were amongst the\nfirst in the country to use the\n'video telephone', and they\nseemed to enjoy doing so.\nThere is no doubt that the\nsystem works. The real\nquestion is going to be\nwhether the University gets\nenough real use out of the\nsystem to make its\ndevelopment worthwhile, or\nwhether British Telecom is\nsimply presented with a marketable product at the end\nof the day, with the\nUniversity's only reward being\nthe prospect of royalties and\nthe knowledge of a 'job well\ndone'.\nTP?\nby Sunny Bains\n\"It will allow more and\nbetter communication...\nbut only If users spend\ntime learning how to use\nIt effectively\"\nThe main hope for the\nsystem is that it will allow\nmore and better\ncommunication between\npeople who are doing similar\nwork in different parts of the\nUniversity, and that it will\nallow intercollegiate teaching.\nThere is no doubt that this is a realistic objective, but only if\nthose who use the system are\nprepared to spend time\nlearning how to use it\neffectively.\nAt the moment the system\ncan give four pictures to any\ncollege simultaneously. By\nswitching one can get as\nmany signals as are\ntransmitting, four at a time. At\nthe moment, all switching is\ndone manually, however,\ndesigning software to make\nthe technician's job obsolete\n(e.g., to keep one channel\nalways switching to whoever is\nspeaking for a more-than-four-way conversation) is part of\nthe development which the\nUniversity has undertaken.\nThe LIVE-NET system is\nstate of the art technology:\nthis does not necessarily\nmean, however, that it will\nautomatically benefit its users.\nA bad or mediocre lecture will\nnot be improved by putting it\non LIVE-NET, indeed, some of\nthe restrictions of the medium\n(such as having a lecturer who\nis forced to stay seated, rather\nthan being able to run around\ngesticulating) could make\nlectures worse. Bad teaching\nwill be emphasised by the\nmedium, not hidden. So far,\nthe system has not always\nbeen used to its user's best\nadvantage, simply through\ninsufficient thought about its\nstrengths and weaknesses.\nA good example of this was\nthe first formal transmission\nfrom IC, a postgraduate\nPhysics lecture. Students who\nattended were from both\nImperial College and\nUniversity College, the UCL\nstudents usually having to\ntravel across London for the\ncourse. Instead, the students\nsimply made their way to the\nTV studios in their respective\ncolleges. The lecture was\nconducted in exactly the same\nway as usual, except that\ninstead of seeing a lecturer\nand a blackboard they saw\nalternate pictures of the\nlecturer's head and his\npre written* notes. The lecturer\nsimply went through the notes\non the screen and the\nstudents dutifully copied them\ndown. There was almost no\ninteraction between the\nstudents and the lecturer\nexcept for the occasional\nquery about a subscript and\none correction. Afterwards,\nthe students said that they\nappreciated not having to\ntravel, but expressed doubts\nabout the legibility of the\nwriting on the screen and the\npace of the lecturer. They felt\nthat because he didn't have to\nwrite anything down himself,\nhe didn't leave enough time\nfor them to take down notes.\nIt may be that this type of\nlecture is more suited to video\ntape than the video network.\nHad the lecture been recorded\nat IC in the morning and sent\nto UCL in the afternoon, then\nthe UCL students would have\nbeen able to stop the tape\nwhen necessary. Any other\nproblems could have been\nsorted out in a twenty minute\nLIVE-NET tutorial or, better\nstill, a face-to-face tutorial\nwhich probably would have to\ntake place anyway.\nFELIX, Wednesday December 10th198621 \"the LIVE-NET system\nshould not be wasted on\nthings for which suitable\ntechnology already\nexists\"\nThe LIVE-NET system\nshould not be wasted on things\nfor which suitable technology\nalready exists. It should be\nused, as far as possible, for\ntruly interactive situations:\nseminars; short committee\nmeetings; more discursive\nlectures; intercollegiate\ndiscussion groups for people in\nthe same discipline; etc. If\nLIVE-NET must be used for\nformal lectures, then\nacademics are going to have to\nThe LIVE-NET system In use during the 'Science for\nColin Grimshaw \u2014 switching the channels for IC.\nrethink their teaching style:\nabandon their old practices for\nsome which are more\ncompatible with television (and\nless compatible with sleep?).\nUnfortunately many academics\nare extremely reluctant to\nchange their styles c\" teaching.\nWe can only hope that the\nprospect of looking foolish on\nTV will give them the impetus\nto think harder about how to\ngive lectures in the studio.\nThe LIVE-NET system is\nrestricted by the fact that only\none group of people can use it\nat once, i.e. there are only as\nmany hours available in the\n'intercollegiate lecture theatre'\nas there are in any other room\nin the University. The LIVENET theatre is also\nconsiderably more expensive\nto maintain. While it is, of\ncourse, necessary to get\npeople to use the system, it is\nmore important in many ways\nto make sure they use it\neffectively right from the\nbeginning.\nThose involved with the\nLIVE-NET project are aware of\nthe problems related to the\nsystem. Indeed, they have a consultant whose job is to\ndeal with the basic problem of\nmaking a man and machine\ncompatible. Perhaps their\nbiggest problem will come in\ntrying to make people want to\ninteract. One can only wish\nthe project the best of luck\nand hope that LIVE-NET can\nhelp to pull the University\ntogether - and not die trying.\nOpinion: A View To\nPacifism At Christmas\nIndustry' Exhibition in October.\nIt should not be taken from this\narticle that all Christians are\nopposed to weapons, the MoT), or\nwhatever, but all Christians desire\npeace in the world by some means,\nand in this sense are pacifists, this\ndesire being firmly based on\nbiblical teaching.\nIt seems self-evident to many\npeople that there exists things\nworth defending, worth dying for,\neven killing for. Most people would\nalso agree that war, killing,\nviolence constitute maybe the\nworst nightmare humans can\nsuffer, and that they should be\navoided as much as possible.\nContrary to most of us, who\nrarely think where the line must be\ndrawn, Augustine of Hippo was a thinker who asked when war can be\njustified. For him, a war was\nacceptable if non-combatants were\nrespected, if it were waged by a legitimate authority for a good\ncause against unjust aggression,\nand if the benefit from fighting it\noutweighed the destruction caused\nby it. A war shouldn't be fought if\nthere was no chance of winning it.\nSt. Augustine's thinking, based on\n4th Century Christianity still\nreflects what we would call\nreasonable requirements.\nOn the other a few people\nthroughout history have rejected\nwar, mainly on religious grounds.\nChristians followed the 'turn the\nother cheek' way of life until people\nstopped burning them and feeding\nthem to the lions (around 300AD). Love for enemies, forgiveness,\nturning the other cheek: Is it just a display of weakness and passivity,\nlike Nietzsche thought? Is it just a bunch of good principles,\nun applicable and impractical in\nthis violent and dangerous world?\nAs a matter of fact, in the last\n4000 years war has failed to\neliminate war from the Earth. The\nnext major war will probably\neliminate the human race as well as\nwars. In the light of modern\nwarfare and of history as a whole\none can't dismiss non-violence as\nnaive or simply defeatist. Couldn't it be precisely because of the use of\nviolence that after every war new\ndivisions immediately form, new\nhatred and new interests drive\npeople to worse conflicts? Couldn't there be something fundamentally\nwrong with the idea that we can\nmake peace by endlessly preparing\nmore destructive weapons? Can we\nreally go on forever, shall they\nnever be used? More than a matter\nof specific policies and politics, we\nseem to be immersed in a society\nwhich 'religiously' believes\nviolence is a reasonable, necessary\nevil.\nThe answers are not easy. We all\nfeel we must protect our families,\nfriends, even our civilization; but\nthe way to do it becomes (as it\nshould) less and less obvious.\nAs a Christmas wish, may we\nstart searching for the way to\nPeace: we who are responsible for\nit.\nM.

    "content": "News FELIX, Wednesday December 10th19865 Stick Of Rock\nThere was a minor row at the IC\nUnion Council Meeting on\nMonday, which culminated in Ian\nHowgate, the Geology Departmental Representative, walking out.\nMr Howgate was upset by the\namount of mundane business on the\nagenda, he objected to the reports of\npeople who did not attend the\nmeeting being considered.\nArguments began when Mr\nHowgate objected to the report\nfrom Postgraduate Academic\nAffairs Officer Gareth Fish. Mr\nFish had sent a written apology for\nbeing unable to attend along with\nhis report. Mr Howgate objected to\nMr Fish's report the grounds of his\nabsence. During the ensuing debate\non whether this was reasonable, Mr\nHowgate also proposed that all of\nthe minutes of Council Committees\nsuch as Internal Services and\nAcademic Affairs be rejected as\nwell. Council Chair Hugh Southey\nexplained that these min u es were\npresented for information purposes\nand that Mr Howgate was \"out of\norder\" in his suggestion. Mr.\nHowgate left the meeting. Earlier he\nhad said that he was upset that the\npapers for Council members were\ncirculated late and had earlier\ncriticised Union publicity as being\nresponsible for the failing of most\nevents this year including Guilds\nCarnival and Rag Carnival.\nHugh Southey later described Mr\nHowgate's action as \"rather\nchildish\". He used some of the time\nafter the otherwise quiet meeting to\nhold a short discussion on\nimproving Council meetings and\nmaking them less intimidating for\nnew members.\nDave Colley, Union Hon\nSecretary, apologised to the meeting\nfor the late circulation of reports but\nexplained that he had been ill and\nthat a lot of the reports had been\nsubmitted to him late. In future\nthere may be a strict deadline for\nsubmission of written reports if they\nare to be circulated before the\nmeeting.\nThe business of the meeting was\nbriefly suspended after Mr Howgate's departure while Chris\nMartin, who had just returned from\nobserving the National Union of\nStudents Conference in Blackpool,\npresented those present whit ha large stick of rock which was broken\nup and passed around.\nWomens\nOfficer\nAt ULU\nThe University of London Union\n(ULU) elected it's first Womens'\nOfficer at the General Union\nCouncil last week, almost a year\nafter IC created a similar post.\nThe post, a non-voting position\non the UL U executive, is to be\nshared between Francis Taylor\n(KQC) and Rachel Picheathly\n(UCL). Beforehand the women\ndelegates to the meeting held a closed discussion to decide whether\nto ask the male delegates to abstain\nin the election. A vote showed equal\nnumbers for and against this\nproposition, and UL U President\nJane Cannon used her casting vote\nto defeat it.\nNo election actually took place,\nhowever, as the candidates agreed to\nshare the post.\nAUL U International Officer was\nalso elected for the first time at the\nsame meeting.\nMike Foulds and Portia Smith in Dramsoc's recent production, \"After the\nFall\" by Arthur Miller, which closed on Saturday.\nBenefits Notice\nOn the 1st September the present Government changed the\nregulations which had made it possible for students to claim\nvarious benefits over the two short vacations. Students can no\nlonger claim unemployment benefit or supplementary benefit\nover the Christmas and Easter vacations, even if they have\npaid enough contributions to qualify under normal\ncircumstances.\nAs from September 1st the College year was officially\nregarded as being 38 weeks long to include the short vacation\nperiods. Students are considered to be still attending College\nduring these short breaks and not available for work, and\ntherefore they become in eli gable for the unemployment and\nsupplementary benefits;\nThe only benefit now available to students is housing\nbenefit, which may be claimed by those not living in Collegeowned residences (such as halls and houses). Unlike in\nprevious years, those ineligible for housing benefit during\nterm time will not have a chance of eligibility during the short\nbreaks.\nAny student with questions on benefits can call into\nStudent Services and see Lesley Gillingham, the IC Welfare\nAdvisor.\nUnion Adrift\nFollowing the emergency meeting of\nCouncil on Friday November 28th, Union Deputy President Jackie\nPierce sent a discussion paper to\nCollege administration as a response\nto the revised plans for the JCR.\nIncluded in this is a definite proposal that ICU should take over the new\nJCR bar, and a speculative\nsuggestion that, given certain\n\u2022 management changes within the\nUnion, control of the QT Snack Bar\nshould be transferred to ICU. The\npaper asks College to confirm or\ndeny that each refectory outlet is\nself-financing and non profit\nmaking, beyond a level necessary for maintenance and refurbishment of\nthat outlet. Clearly this \"perceived\naim of the refectory system\" does\nnot apply in the case of QT, which\nhas been raking in a healthy profit\never since it opened just before the\nstart of term. It is really rather naive\nof Council to expect a constructive\nresponse to a proposal such as this,\nand but for a healthy caution which\nthe Union is wisely displaying, the\nsituation would be very similar to the\n\"let's get the Union bar\"fever which\naffected last year's Executive. The\nmore important question, however,\nis whether ICU is acting correctly in\ntrying to expand the Union-backed\nservices. Already the administrative\nchores take up too large a proportion of each sabbatical's time, and if the\nUnion services are expanded further, it will be more difficult for the Union\nofficers to contribute something\npositive to ICU during their term of\noffice.\nSeason's Greetings\nLooking back on this term's FELIX, I have been disappointed\nwith the lack of variety in the\ncontent, and will be taking steps to\ntry to improve this next term. As\never, this depends entirely on the\navailability of as many people as\npossible to write and paste up. After\nChristmas there will be a staff\nmeeting on Monday January 5th( the\nfirst day of term), and this will be\nfollowed by regular Friday meetings\nat 12.30pm. Please try to find your way to the office sometime early\nnext term.\nCredits\nThe amount of work put into\nFELIX by some members of staff\nthis term has been quite startling.\nMy own performance as Editor has\nfrequently left a lot to be desired,\nand so I am especially grateful to the\nfollowing for their continuing help\nand tolerance; Chris Martin, Chris\nEdwards, Bill Goodwin, Mole, Pippa\nSalmon, Judith Hackney, Kamala\nSen, Nigel Whitfield, Jane Spiegel,\nAaron Kotcheff, David Williams,\nDavid Burns, Liz Holford, Alex\nMcNeil, Richard Bleasdale, Richard\nFincher, Gail Turner, Sarah Kirk,\nIan Thomas, Hugh Southey, Mark\nCottle, David Wooding, Norman,\nMark Hunter and Fourth Avenue,\nGren Manuel, David Rowe, Pallab\nGhosh, Colin Palmer, Steve Cook,\nLaura Dain, Rosemary Hosking and\nSteve Shacked.

Even attempting to\ndo \"something completely different\" has become as\nhopelessly traditional as the festival itself, and so it\nis with very little hesitation that I recommend that\nyou spend this Christmas in exactly the same way as\nyou have spent and will spend, every other\nChristmas; you won't escape it, so you may as well\nwallow in it along with the rest of us.\nIn fact I doubt if, given the choice, you'd really\nwant to do anything else anyway - oh, alright then,\nof course you would, but bear with me anyway, will\nyou? Aftei all, at what other time of the year can\nyou sav our the rare delights of arguing with all your\nrelatives at the same time, watching non-stop drivel\non TV whilst working your way through your\nparents' drinks cabinet-as like as not with their full\nknowledge and approval, and explaining to your\nmother why you really don't feel like even looking\nat her Christmas lunch, far less actually eating it.\nOn the subject of rare delights, I 've always\nmaintained that there's no better source of\nChristmas Eve entertainment than the local church's Watchnight Service-that subtle blend of sincerity and\nsarcasm as the minister declares how nice it is to see\nthe church so full, well, it gets me in stitches every\nyear. Better still is the sheer exquisite em barras ment of my granny lusting after the organist and\nattempting to quiet en down the \"rowdies\" in the\npew behind us (i.e. those of my friends who are\nun encumbered by elderly relatives.)

Being a barbarian you tell\nyourself that Fourier Transforms are\nwizard's business and not to be\ntampered with.\nSuddenly, as your ears clear from\nthe shock of being sent spiralling\nthrough the dimensions by a powerful\nspell \u2014 something, which along with\nsmoking the Gilda weed, the Council\nof Alchemists has put an official\nhealth warning on \u2014 you realise that\nsomeone is trying to talk to you.\nHis language is difficult to\nunderstand, but you can just about\nwork out that he is asking if you are a Barbanogram and who is it that you\nare looking for.\nYou tell him that you are Boris the\nBarbarian, and have been sent here by\na mighty wizard who was pissed off at\nlosing at Poker. The man says he\nunderstands and starts to explaining\nabout the place he calls the 'Stock\nExchange'. It is only when he gets to\nthe bit about Milton Friedman and\nMonetarism that you realise you are\nfalling into a deep sleep.\nMake a saving roll on Intelligence.\nIf you make it go to 30. If you fail go\nto 15.\n2 Don't you find this mindless\nviolence boring after a while? Very\nwell, you kill her. Now, do you kill the\nman (31) or run away (20)?\n3 You go over to the window,\nwhere you tell the receptionist all your\ndetails. She tells you that there isn't much demand for barbarians these\ndays, especially without any 'O' levels.\nShe gives you a piece of card with\nthe name of are gf up on it, and\ntells you tc . on every other\nMonday. Puzzled as to why a reggae\ngroup should appear there, you\nwander down to the Jobcentre. Go to\n22.\n4 At that point the Managing\nDirector comes in and tells you that\nhe likes your style. He says he has just had a visit from the Alliance leader,\nwho says that Roy Jenkins just isn't the man he was, and would you like to\nstand at the next election for the\nAlliance.

Do you pay her (13) or get a job instead (20)?\n6 Roll a die. If it comes up\n1\u20143, go to 17, if it comes up 4\u20146, go\nto 12.\n7 Not doing very well today,\nare we Boris? As a result of your\ninability to get the dice to do the right\nthing, you are now in a room of\nglowing glass screens. Next time try\nnudging the table, or use loaded dice\nor something. Anyway, Geoffrey has\nbrought you to this roo:\njobber.\nAs far as you can mak f 'out, this\ninvolves bashing lots of kw so that\nnumbers appear on the screen, and\nhead-butting the screen if this doesn't work.

The\ninterviewer doesn't seem to be too\nkeen on your style of dress, and that\nyour sword is somewhat aggressive,\nand she didn't know what the ILEA\nwould have to say about it.\nRoll a die, if it comes up 1\u20143, go to\n26, if it comes up 4\u20146, go to 33.\n13 You give her a Grog \u2014 a large piece of nearly solid gold with a small admixture of lead depending on\nthe honesty of the local mint \u2014 and\nsettle into your room.\nFeeling tired after the day's exertions, you go to sleep. Several\nhours later you are awakened by the\nsound of moaning and a hideous\nslapping, cracking sound.

Disturbed at\nhis lack of resistance you wonder if\nyou have done the right thing, but this\nis the sort of action barbarians are\nfamous for and you tell yourself how\nproud your father would be right now at killing your first Stockbroker. You notice that a lot of people all\nseem to be looking at you now, with a few screaming and shouting quite a lot. Do you run away (18) or wait\naround (28)?\n25 Now let's face it, chaos is\nyour favourite atmosphere, and you\nhack into the assembled crowds until\nthere is just you and a lot of dead\nbodies in the room.

    "content": "News. FELIX, Wednesday December 10th19864 Slinging The Shit\nThe Geology Department is\ncarrying out a major review of safety\nin an effort to reduce the risks from\nhazardous biological and mineral\nsubstances analysed by researchers.\nThe move follows a scare when two\nboxes alleged to contain\nRhinocerous droppings and blood\nsamples were delivered to the\ndepartment three weeks ago. The\nsamples had not been referred to the\nBiological sub-commit te on safety,\nas is usual when biological samples\nare brought into the university,\nraising fears that they may present a safety hazard. Further concern was\nraised when a post graduate\nworking with the samples\ncontracted Tic Typhus, Protocols\nare now being drawn up by the\nGeological Safety Department and\nfuture projects will be referred to the\nCollege Head of safety, Dr Gordon\nHeardgreaves, for asses ment of\nbiological and toxic hazards.\nGuidelines for collecting minerals in\nthe field will also be draught ed in an\nattempt to prevent the re cu u rence of\nrecent incidents in which students\nhave collected radioactive and toxic\nmaterials, including blue asbestos,\nfor polishing and grinding.\nInvestigations following the\nconvening of an Emergency Safety\nmeeting, at the request of trade\nunion officials, revealed that soil\nand vegetation from Nahuru\nNational Park in Kenya had been\nsent to Imperial for trace element\nanalysis in a project by Dr Ian\nThornton and post graduate John\nMaskall designed to make the park\nsuitable for Rhinocerous habitation.\nSamples of Impala blood were\ndelayed at Imperial, on the way for\nanalysis at the Mardun Institute of\nEducation, for three weeks when Mr\nMaskall was hospitalised with Tic\nTyphus. The soil, which had been\nsun-baked prior to shipment before\nheat-treatment at Imperial to\nremove moisture, was examined by\nHead of Safety, Gordon Heardgreaves and Ian French ofthe\nBiology Department and found to\nbe non-hazardous. The blood, it was\nrevealed, has been heat treated to 56\ndegrees celcius before shipping and\nwas stored in ad aqua te containers.\nCommenting on the incidents, a safety official in Geology told\nFELIX that he was sup rise d that the\nsamples had not been reported to\nthe Biological Subcommittee and\npointed out that there may have\nbeen a potential danger. He added\n\"the events have illustrated a weakness in the College safety\nprocedure and the whole College\nwill have to be informed of the\nexistance of the Biological and\nHazardous Substances Committees\".\nHead of Safety in the Geology\nDepartment, Bob Kinghorn, was\ninterviewed by FELIX last Tuesday\nevening. After discussing the issue\nfor twenty minutes, he then decided\nto retract everything he had said,\nsaying that he did not trust FELIX\nto quote him accurately.\nFaked Burglaries\nForty one students living in College\nhalls and houses had their rooms\n\"burgled\" by a special IC Union\nsecurity team on Thursday 27th November. In each case the doors to\nthe rooms had been left open or\nunlocked whilst the rooms were\nunattended.\nThe action was part of a Security\nAwareness Campaign carried out by\nthe ICU Welfare Committee. The\nburgling team were briefed to look\nfor the sort of situations that are\nallowing walk-in thieves to remove\nconsiderable amounts of property\nfrom student accommodation. In\neach case where a room was vacant\nthe \"burgle rs\" left stickers that\nproclaimed that the room had been\nburgled and warned residents to\n\"lock it or lose it\".\nThe action was carried out with\nthe full approval and cooperation of\nthe College Chief Security Officer,\nGeoffrey Reeves, and the wardens\nof the halls and houses concerned.\nThe team carried badges bearing\nMr. Reeves signature to avoid\nconfusion with genuine intruders.\nWelfare Officer, Tom MelliarSmith has warned that residents\nshould never assume that anyone\nwandering around the halls is there\nfor a legitimate reason and that\nanyone who is engaged on College\nor Union business should always be\nable to prove it if challenged. He\nsaid he though the campaign had\nbeen quite successful in its aim of\nThird\nDegree\ns uprising people into being more\naware of the security problem.\nThe worst residences in terms of\nopen rooms were Southside and Beit\nhalls and Southwell house. The only\nhitch in the whole operation was\nwhen one of the Southside Assistant\nSubwardens tried to stop the team\non his staircase because he was not\nin favour of the security campaign.\nHe finally insisted upon contacting\nthe warden, Mr. Paul Jowitt,\nwhereupon Mr. Jowitt instructed\nhim to stop hindering the team.\nStudents who started on a four-year\ncourse leading to a BEng in October\n1983 (or later) will be awarded a MEng on graduation if a change to\nthe University of London\nregulations is approved.\nThe regulations are currently\nbeing considered by the Privy\nCouncil, and a one-year period for\nobjections to be lodged expires in\nfour months time, with none so far\nreceived. The same set of changes\nwill mean that most who started\nthree year course leading to the\nBSC(Eng) after the summer of 1984\nwill receive a BEng. The only\ncourses not to be upgraded in this\nway are those of Computing and\nMetallurgy, which do not at present\ninclude the necessary economics\nand human ties courses in the\nsyllabus.\nHowever, the Academic Council\nof the University of London, which\nmakes decisions on the awarding of\ndegrees, has not accepted the\nprinciple of backdating the changes.\nThis leads to the unusual situation\nwhere students who have missed a year, for example through illness or\nfailing exams, will graduate at the\nsame time and from the same course\nas others who will receive a more\nadvanced qualification, putting\nthem at a possible disadvantage for\nlife. It is understood that College is\ncampaigning within the University\nof London to have the decision on\nbackdating changed.\nGrant Not\nEnough\n\"Student grants aren't high enough\nto live on\", according to the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience. This admission has come\nout of a Government enquiry into\nstudent finances. The Science and\nArts Select Committee are also\ninvestigating funding for students.\nThe National Union of Students\nhave recommended that grants be\nraised by 21% to bring them up to\nthe same level, in real terms, as in\n1978/79. Other NUS proposals are\nto lower the age at which students\nare considered 'independent' when\nconsidering awards, and to\nintroduce an allowance of \u00a335pw for\nall students over 16.\nBroken Lift\nThe hydraulic lift used by the CCU\nMotor Clubs has been repeatedly\nbroken, during the past term. The\nlift, situated by the Jez garage, near\nthe Old Chemisty building, is\nsecured by an electromagnetic lock\nto prevent accidents. Keys to the lift\nare available from both RCS and\nGuilds Motor Clubs but the lock has\nbeen forced at least twice this term,\nat a cost of \u00a3130 a time.\nRuddy\nEnormous\nThe Natural History Museum has\nidentified a record-breaking 41b2oz rudd, breaking a record which has\nstood unchallenged since 1933.\nAlwyne Wheeler, the Museum's Ichythyologist and scientific advisor\nto the British Record (Rod Caught)\nCommittee identified the specimen\nby the number and shape of the\npharyngeal teeth, and the relative\npositions of the fins.\nThe specimen rudd will be on\ndisplay to the public in the Museum\nfrom the end of December.\nThe rudd is particularly tasty if\nlightly fried in butter, and served\nwith a white wine sauce.\nOpen Day\nAn open day organised by the staff\nand students of the RSM last\nThursday attracted over 250\nschoolchildren. The cost of the\nevent was \u00a31300, of which \u00a3800 was\ndonated by industry. Dr Harry\nShaw of the Geology Department,\none of the organisers, said that the\nevent was great success, and\nexpressed his thanks to the staff and\nstudents for their help.\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews. FELIX, Wednesday December 10th198617** mm\nBooks\n\"Billy Boy\" by W. Mason, Methuen\n\u00a32.95.\nThis first novel by author William\nMason chronicles the life and times\nof Billy Jenkins, a working class\nteacher struggling to make a living\nin Jamaica. Billy flees Jamaica after\ngetting into trouble with the local\ngang who put out a death contract\non him. Returning to England he\nmeets Caroline and falls in love with\nher. Caroline has, however, only got\neyes for Callum, her childhood\nsweetheart, and ignores Billy totally.\nDuring an intensely erotic\nchapter set in Callum's flat,\nCaroline realises that Callum's love\nis merely a sham and runs to be with\nBilly. Billy, thinking that his love is\nunrequited, and after a particularly\nlong and moving account of his\ndifficult childhood, has meanwhile\nhung himself.\nThe book ends with Caroline\nweeping over Billy's body in his flat\nin the East End of London.\nThe prose captures the frailties of\nthe human condition with startling\nprecision and is well worth the\nstruggle through some of the\nlengthier chapters, just for Billy's monologue premature to his\nuntimely death.\nNigel Barker,\nIAN A DA MS ON AND RICHARD KENNEDY\nSINCLAIR\nHAND THE MB SUNRISE'\nTECHNOLOGY\nYo ho ho! Christmas is a coming\nand the EEC turkeys, fattened with\no estrogen s are getting fat. Those\nnice people, the penguin press office,\nhave sent me four books to review\nfor your delectation and delight,\nand here they are; starring (in\nalphabetical order) Ian Adamson\nand Richard Kennedy's de bagging of the Sinclair myth \"Sinclair and\nt ne Sunrise Technology\", Robert\nBolt's \"The Mission\", Bengt and\nMarie-Therese Danielson' s \"Poisoned Reign\" and Margot\nLivesey's \"Learning By Heart\".\nThe Sinclair book is a bit turgid\nfor holiday reading, but would come\nin handy as a case study for an\neconomics essay. In this type of\nbook two flaws are open to the\nbiographer/journalist; either to\nconcentrate on personalities at\nexpense of fact or on fact at the\nexpense of personality. Unfortunately the latter course was taken,\nand when I wanted to know what Sir\nClive is like\u2014does he beat his kids\n(or even does he have any), what was\nthe result of his forceful mother on\nhis life, does he eat boiled eggs for\nbreakfast?\u2014I was left with a couple\nof pages at the beginning and a few\nreferences to his \"forcefulness and\ndetermination\". A very masculine\nbiography, dare I say, with the one\nnoticeable feature being the way\nthat all these little-boys-playing-at-electronics monumentally failed to\nanswer the question; \"what good is\nit?\". Mini at uris ation and\ninnovation were ends in themselves.\nCosts \u00a33.95.\n\"The Mission\" book of the film is\nseveral orders of magnitude more\ninteresting than Sinclair, and a good\nread whether you've seen the film or\nnot. In many places it fills out the\ncharacters and eliminates the\ndevious politics of the court of\nPortugal that cost the Missions their\nexistance. Some new personalities\nare introduced, such as the\nambitious Carvalho, Portugal's Minister for Foreign Affairs. The\nspan of the film is better at\ntransmitting the clash between the\nKingdom of God and the Kingdom\nof men, and the'emotional content is\nmore charged; the book is more\ncalm and detached: it stands back\nand gives a factual account. Costs\n\u00a32.95 and definitely worth it.\n\"Poisoned Reign\" by Bengt and\nMarie-Therese Danielson is\nsubtitled, \" French nuclear\ncolonialism in the Pacific\". It details\nthe way the French Government has\npettily resisted all moves to\nPolynesian independence so that\nthey can explode a few atom\nbombs...Dare one draw parallels\nwith \"The Mission\"\u2014one of the\nmost outspoken prop on ants of\nindependence was Pouvanaa, a Christian pastor who was arrested\non a trumped-up charge of arson at\nthe age of 64 and sentenced to 8\nyears solitary confinement plus 15\nyears banishment from Polynesia. A very well-written book, it would\nmake you a confirmed Francophobe, if the authors (who are\ngoodies) weren't French as well.\nCosts \u00a33.95.\nThe last and best book \"Learning\nBy Heart\" is the first collection of\nMargot Livesey's short stories. They\nare all subtle, with a faintly mystical\nair; details are distilled. Many of the\nstories are about rocky and\nembittered human relationships\u2014\nan elder sister who would not let her\nyounger sister marry until she had, a man obsessed by death, breaking up\nmarriages, purely horrible children\nand a man who for 'a small price'\nseduces a shop-girl in a petty way.\nThe longest story, 'Learning By\nHeart' traces the mirrored lives of a young woman and her stepmother;\nthe knock-on effect of un loving \u2014\nfrom her stepmother's unhappy\nchildhood comes the daughter's own misery. To quote W.H. Auden,\nmy pretentious bit for the week;\n\"Those to whom evil is done/Do\nevil in return\". But that was about\nHitler. The book nevertheless\nmanages to steer clear of depression,\nand is full of the \"warp and woof of\nhuman experience\", costs \u00a33.95 and\nthough it sounds na ff to say it,\nwould make an ideal Christmas\npresent.\nHappy Christmas and a Merry\nNew Year,\nSarah Kirk.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix FELIX, Friday November 28th198623 Sailing\nSailors\nAdrift\nTen members of IC Sailing Club\nfilled two cars on Saturday and set\noff for Oxford with some foggy idea\nof the whereabouts of Farmoor\nreservoir. The first arrived safely,\nthe other three quarters of an hour\nlater. Our Captain and Commodore\nlost themselves in Abingdon and\nasked for directions. Fortunately,\nthe hapless individual they picked\non was a member of last years team\nand knew where the reservoir was!\nBack at the pond there was no\nwind and the water lay shrouded in\nmist. A decision on whether to race\nwas postponed until the afternoon,\nand Oxford sternly got on with some\nboat repairs, both teams thinking of\nall the far more interesting things\nthey could be doing.\nAfter lunch it was left to your\nintrepid reporter to lead the way. He\nsailed off alone into the mist in\nsearch of the windward mark. This\nforced the others to get changed and\ngo in search of him. Miraculously\nthe mist began to lift and some wind\nappeared enabling racing to begin,\nyour reporter having mane ou ve red both teams onto the water.\nIn the testing light-air conditions\nIC lacked boat speed in the\nunfamiliar Laser 2's. Added to this\nour Commodore's delight in sailing\ninto things (like the opposition) and\nhis quick test of his dry suit neck-seal (it leaks!) meant that the first\nfew races all went Oxford's way.\nEventually the team pulled itself\ntogether and began to show what it\nwas capable of, but by this time it\nwas too late on in the curtailed series\nof races. The result was a narrow\ndefeat by a team not tactically\nsuperior just slightly faster, the rematch in the Spring promises to be\neven more closely fought. Many\nthanks must go to our two drivers\nSam and Adam and to our\nCommodore Richard for getting us\nthere, (via Abingdon?)\nThose present (and guilty)\nRichard Brimelow (Commodore),\nMalcolm Hunter, Rrichard Jacman,\nApostolos Leonidhopoulos, Daniel\nLucas-Clements, Charles Oxley,\nSamantha Page (Captain), Jenny\nRamsey, Adam Stork, Eric.\nRugby\nRugby Firsts Flatter\nThe score line in this match was\nextremely flattering towards\nGoldsmiths, who were definitely the\nweaker team. Goldsmiths scored\nfirst, after a very lucky kick on in the\nIC half, but after that did not really\nget a look into the match. The\nGoldsmiths pack was comprehensively outplayed in every\ndepartment of the game, especially\nin the sc rummage, where their heavy\npack was destroyed by IC's organisation and drive. IC's second\nrun combination of Rob Hogrove\nand Louis Christopher drove the\nGoldsmiths pack off the park and\nwere rewarded by a pushover try in\nthe first half. After half time Andy\nWatson, the IC scrum-half, stormed\nover for the final try of the match,\nafter which Goldsmiths tried to\nmake up for their lack of both brains\nand skill by the use of dirty\nplay\u2014needless to say, it did not\nwork. IC were now through into the\nnext round of the Gutteridge Plate\nCompetition, which will carry on\nafter Christmas.\nFootball\nFirsts Lose On Penalties\nIC's best performance of the season\nended in heartache as Essex moved\ninto the next round of the UAU on\nthe lottery of penalty kicks. Essex\nwere the villains of the piece,\naccording to the IC camp, after the\nreply was forced to be played again\nat Colchester. Also, preparations\ndid not go according to plan\u2014IC\nsuffered their first defeat this season\nat the 13th hurdle to a very strong\nLondon Hospital Side.\nUncharacteristically, IC made a superb start, completely\noverrunning the opposition, and\ntaking the lead after 10 minutes\nwhen Paul Olden's powerful\ndownward header bounced into the\ntop corner. Shortly after, Byron\nWood almost made it 2\u20140 when his\nshot at the far post was miraculously\nkicked away by the Essex keeper.\nEssex began to find their attacking\nmovements, and they nearly scored\ntwice, once hitting the underside of\nthe crossbar. Essex's equalise r, was\nfor tui tio us, however, as an Essex\nplayer's overhead kick found the\ntop corner, the half-time score\nstayed at 1\u20141.\nIn the first meeting, Essex's all\nround fitness told in the second half,\nbut this time round, to their\nimmense credit, IC dominated\nproceedings while not creating\nmany chances. Essex made even\nless. But the pressure of not\nconceding anything meant that the\nmidfield s were packed and defences\nsolid. The full-time score remained\n1\n\u2014\n1\nExtra time came and went in a flash and hence to penalties. Essex\nscored all of their five kicks, and no\none can argue with that.\nTeam:A. Allen, M. Bradley, P. Ewart, P. Dyson, L. Dovill, B. Wood, S. Cole, P. Olden, N. Vandenbegin, D. Lynne (Capt.), N. Collier, Sub:R. Kelly.\nFootball\nFrom The Sublime\nAfter losing last time out, Selkirk\nHall football team introduced some\nnew faces on Sunday. With a groin-strain causing skipper M. Birmingham to fail a late fitness test,\nthe scene was set for the return ofthe\nelegant skills of R. Tonge. This was\nto prove a decisive factor.\nDue to security considerations,\nthe team were told that they were to\nplay Norman and the Nutburgers,\nhowever this week's opposition\nwere the experienced Egyptian\nEmbassy F.C. Selkirk quickly went 1\u2014Oup with\na tap in by P. Cardwell, but the\ndiplomats were not to be thwarted.\nA well built move resulted in a crashing shot to equalise.\nIt was late in the first half that the\never-threatening Tonge struck.\nWith a breathtaking run beating\nfour men, he proceeded to walk the\nball around former Egyptian\nnational team goalkeeper A. Lydabylls'it to put the IC team\nahead.\nIn the second half Tonge\ncombined well with Cardwell to\npresent the latter with the first hattrick of his international career.\nThe final result was 4\u20142 win for\nSelkirk.\nFootball\nTo The Ridiculous\nThis was the big one: crashes of\nthunder and sheets of lightning\nrained down on the blessed turf as\nthe Gods jostled for a good view of\nthe game. Commander Galloway\nled his faithful into the arena and in\nno time play had commenced\nEven before the IC war machine\nhad engaged first gear. The\nopposition dealt it a glancing blow\nwith a headed glance. But their\nexcessive excitement ended\nextremely quickly. Psycho\nGalloway, fired up and eyes blazing,\nput Jet-Pack Johnson thro-i gh, who\nunleashed a ground to air\nthunder cracker from his own six\nyard line.\nEven the Gods exclaimed: \"Naff\nThat For a Net Nobbier\"\nBut the Vths take no prisoners\nand set to work laying siege on\nQMC's isolated penalty area.\nRewards came swiftly\u2014Neville\nNeville amazed everyone with a curling back-heel from the half-way\nline. Adrian (the Irish farmer's mad\nson) scored a hat-trick in 24\nseconds, Charlie slipped in a quickie\nto add to the mounting mountain of\ngoals and then Rapier Radley scored\ntwice in a mad 4 minutes frenzy.\nCowardly QM C quietly\ncapitulated and congratulated our\ncast-iron comrades. \"Great stuff!\"\nsaid the Priest.\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Wednesday December 10th198619 Those Who Would\nBe President\nBriefcases and Filofaxes will be\nproducing ugly bulges in Christmas\nstockings for many, but budding\nPresidential candidates will be\ngetting highlights put in their hair,\ncontact lenses and a new pair of\nflares. It's only December and the\nrace is on us once again as to who\ncan gain credibility as quickly as\npossible without actually achieving\nanything.\nWhose are the faces that will be\nadorning the walkway, and pushed\nunder every hall door in February?\nSpotting the Presidential candidate\nis an easy task. The subject will first\nexpress an irrepressible need to\nspeak at UGMs, no matter how little\nthey know about a topic. The next\nstep is to try to get on as many\ncommittees as possible, even if it\nmeans crashing them in the first\nplace. The final, fatal stage is to\nwrite long articles in various College\nmagazines on their current\nprovince, be it as Internal\nLavatories Officer or C CU Vomit\nMonitor. When this stage is reached\nthere is no turning back, and usually\nleads to permanent emotional scars,\nsuch as actually becoming\nPresident.\nFELIX presents its own dossier\non who has developed this\nfrightening syndrome around\ncollege this year.\nIan Howgate's cardboard cut out was\nnot too keen on being\nphotographed.\nDiagnosed as suffering from an\nacute form of committee\nattendance, Ian 'Showroom Dummy'\nHowgate has shown such keenness\nto be elected that he has even sent\napologies for his absence to Exec\nmeetings. His need to speak on any\nmatter as long as it is about student\nresidence or security has led to him\nmaking up totally fictitious stories\nabout Weeks Hall and then\na polo gi sing for the situation in\npublic.\nHowever this ability to keep quiet\nhas meant that his soon-to-be-created cardboard cut-out replica is\ncurrently one of the favourites for\nthe Presidency. Its combination of\nsilence and inability to write makes\nit incapable of embarrassing itself\nand has been shown to be more\npopular as it has been invited to all\ncommittee meetings in the Union.\nIn a last ditch bid to\nsave last year's RCS\nDinner, Tom MelliarSmith does a hopeless\nimpression of Willie\nRushton.\nAnother approach to the\nPresidential campaign is to take as\nmany first years as possible in order\nto gain fame and votes\u2014often using\nfalse registration slips to prove they\nare really students (one of the little\nrules that stops people like Ronald\nReagan and Papa Doc Duvalier\nfrom ever becoming President).\nThe current exponent of this\ntechnique is Tom 'Fallguy' MeliarSmith who has managed to spend\nhis time in Life Science I, Pretending\nTo Be Life Sci I Again Though Not\nReally A Student At All, and now\nGeology I. However during his\n'enforced holiday' he held down the\npost of RCS Hon Sec is spite of a few\nrules banning that sort of thing\u2014so\nformal ites like 'good academic\nstanding' in order to be a sabbatical\nshouldn't bother him too much.\nDue to a mix-up at the\nchemists we are unable\nto bring you Hugh\nSouthey's bum, but we\nthink you'll find the\npalm trees we were sent\ninstead far more\nattractive.\nThere are certain advantages with\nalready having been a sabbatical, a la Hugh 'Bigbum' Southey one-time\nFELIX Editor and now holder of\nthe maximum number of legitimate\ncommittee posts himself. Bigbum\nseems to believe that the art of being\na good Presidential candidate is to\nsit on any committee he can,\nwithout actually achieving\nanything. Only two things stand in\nhis way: his constant gyratory\nmotion makes it impossible to take\nclear photographs of him for his\nelection publicity, and secondly\nJackie might not let him stand.\nIncorrigible rubber\nfetishist, Chas Jackson\ntries on his latest outfit.\nA no less senior compatriot in Chem\nEng is Chas 'Grandpa' Jackson,\n\u2022 whose extraordinary keenness to be\nPublicity Officer\u2014hot favourite as\nthe naf fest job in the Union together\nwith Ordinary Member of Reactor\nSafety Committee\u2014is curious to say\nthe least. However, his interest in\nposters may extend just as long as\nFebruary when his own face starts\nappearing on the Walkway. He can\ncite as previous experience his less\nthan friendly attitude to people\ncaught borrowing stools from the\nSnack Bar.\nSimon Singh in his\nfamous impersonation\nof Dame Edna Everage.\nBacking the CCU corner is Simon\n'Short Skirt' Singh, so named\nbecause of his habit of getting\nvarious Rocky Horror events\norganised just so that he can show of\nhis legs at them, or it might be due to\nChristine extolling the virtues of\ndressing up in drag that has brought\nthis on. We may have seen the birth\nof a new form of sabbatical\ncredibility.t His other qualification\nfor the job is his political\nambivalence, otherwise known as\nhypocrisy. Whilst backing the thrice\nfailed student, Tony Spencer as\nBroadsheet Editor, he was\nsomewhat less at home with the idea\nof having Tom Meliar-Smith as\nHon Sec last year despite his similar\nsituation.\n\n"

    "content": "News. FELIX, Wednesday December 10th19863 QT Revisited\nThe Students' Union is pressing the\nCollege for control of the QT snack\nbar in the Sherfield building, in\ncompensation for an expected\n\u00a312000 loss in conference revenue\nshould the College's plans go ahead.\nMeanwhile, the academic staff are\nprotesting about the College's intention to convert the Senior\nCommon Room into a refectory,\nand are particularly concerned that\nthey had not been properly\ninformed of the proposals.\nIn a document presented to the\nCollege last week, the Union\npointed out that the loss of space in\nthe Junior Common Room will\nsubstantially reduce their takings\nwhen the JCR is let,to conferences\nduring vacations. They estimate\nthat further losses would be\nincurred by reduced sales of books\nto conferences.\nThe matter was raised at a public\nmeeting called by the Rector,\nProfessor Eric Ash, on Tuesday\nlunchtime, during which College\nSecretary John Smith explained the\nneed for more refectory facilities. He\npointed out that the number of\nstudents using the refectories had\nshown an unexpected increase this\nyear of 1400 above the predicted\nfigure.\nHence, said Mr. Smith, the\nCollege's original plan to swap the\nJCR with the Sherfield buttery\ncould no longer take place. \"We can\ngo back to the old proposal if\nCollege demands, but I won't be\nresponsible if it goes wrong,\" he\nsaid. He added that the congestion\nin the JCR was the result of the\nBalls\nPocketed\nFourteen coloured balls were stolen\nfrom the Snooker Club in the Union\nBuilding last Tuesday. The theft\nfollows an incident on November\n14th after the Guilds' Carnival when\ntwo red and two black balls were\nstolen and two windows broken.\nClub President David Rhodes has\nappealed for the return of the balls\nwith the promise that 'no questions\nwill be asked'. The Club Junior\nTreasurer, Richard Wiles, said that\nthe Club would be looking at the\npossibility of buying a new set of\nballs, however,- in the meantime it\nmay be forced to close down one of\n'he tables. The Club is also\nconsidering closing an hour earlier\nto avoid bar closing time.\nCollege not for seeing that users of\nQT would use the seating space in\nthe JCR.\nThe issues were again discussed at\na meeting of the Refectory Users'\nCommittee later on Tuesday\nafternoon. FELIX reporters\napproached Mr. Chalmers, the\nSenior Assistant Secretary, for\npermission to observe the\nprocedures, but were denied access\nto the meeting.\nThe Academic Staff Assembly\nmeanwhile has written to the Rector\ncomplaining that they had only\nfound out about the moves\naccidentally and expressing the need\nfor staff to be able to entertain\nvisitors and hold confidential\nconversations.\nGoing For A Singh\nThe Royal College of Science Union\nwill be holding an \"Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting\" today. The\nmeeting has been called at the\nrequest of more than 50 members of\nRCSU, who have signed a petition\ncriticising President Simon Singh's leadership of the Union.\nThe petition was delivered to\nRSCU Hon. Secretary Guy Perry\nlast week. The students are\nconcerned that Mr Singh has made a series of decisions without the\nproper backing of the Union. In\nparticular he has been attacked for\nnot calling enough Union General\nMeetings or General Commitee\nMeetings. Mr Singh has also\ndismissed Broadsheet Editor Tony\nSpencer, who is not a current\nstudent, without consulting either\nthe rest of the executive or the\nGeneral Committee. This was a decision which Mr Singh does no l strictly have the authority to make\nSeveral senior RCS students have\nsigned the petition, including Sunnv\nBains of Physics 2, who proposed\nMr Singh for the post of President in\nlast years election.\nThe petition was organised by\nPaul Bailey who told FELIX why he\nwas protesting against Mr Singh. He\nsaid that Mr Singh had made a lot of\ndecisions that were rel event to\nRCSU, but was failing to tell the\nUnion about them. He added that\nMr Singh had tried to take over the\nrole of Entertainments Chairman in\nthe last few weeks, instead of letting\nothers get on with their jobs.\nRCSU Vice President Judith\nHackney said later that she and Guy\nPerry felt that Mr Singh has acted\nvery hastily in making a decision\n.about Tony Spencer.\nSilent\nNightline\nWest London Nightline suffered an\nunexpected financial setback this\nyear, due to an oversight by last\nyear's ICU Deputy President Dave\nKingston. This could cost Nightline\n\u00a3675, which would threaten training\nweekends and fact i lites for\noperation. Imperial College\nnormally pays \u00a33,000 directly to\nNightline, which is in addition to\n\u00a3675 provided by ICU. This year,\nthe sum paid by College was paid\nthrough the Union as a trial\narrangement, so increasing the\nUnion sub vent ion, on paper. Mr\nKingston did not fully understand\nwhere his nose was and so set the\nUnion contribution at \u00a33,000, so\neffectively cutting Nightline's funding by \u00a3675. The error was not\nnoticed until recently, and as this\nyear's budget has already been\nfixed, the Union will either have to\nmake a contingency claim or re wit e the budget if they wish to rectify the\nmistake.\nHolbein\nHouse\nBanned From\nDinner\nStudents from Holbein House have\nbeen banned from the College\nChristmas Dinner on Thursday\nbecause of alleged bad behaviour\nduring last year's event. The ban\nwas imposed in an attempt to\nprevent the re curran ce of excessive\ndrinking and food fights by some of\nthe residents. Ten students who\nwere not from Holbein have also\nbeen banned for disruptive\nbehaviour.\nOne Holbein resident had to be\nescorted home during last year's dinner, and another vomited on the\ntable.\nCommenting on the ban, House\nWarden Barry Saunders said that\nalthough he wasn't completely\nsurprised by the move, he had not\nreceived any official College\nnotification beforehand. He also\npointed out that a number of\nstudents had only been told that\nthey had been banned after buying\ntickets, and that last year's problem\ncould have been prevented if alcohol\nhad been suffice ntl y controlled.\nThe Holbein Students Residence\nCommittee will be holding their\nown function as an alternative to the\ndinner.\n\n"

A Union spokesperson described the\nsituation as \"bloody ridiculous\".\nFortunately, most students have\neventually been able to find suitable\nplaces to live, but security in College\nresidences was put under question\nfollowing the rape of a nurse in\nHamlet Gardens. Locking doors\nwere fitted but the lack of working\nentry phones and keys presented\nmore problems for residents.\nThere was more trouble for Mr\nPeter Hallworth, the Managing\nSurveyor of Residences, regarding\nthe inadequate cooking facilities in\nTizard and Selkirk Halls. The\nproblems have been going on since\nlast year, when staircase kitchens\nwere built in Falmouth Keough Hall\nbut not in Tizard or Selkirk. Not\nonly are the present kitchens too\nsmall, but the positioning of fridges\non staircases contravenes fire\nregulations. No decision has yet\nbeen made on how or when the\nimprovements will be made.\nI Tiddlewinking down\nOxford Street For Rag\nTie Clubs; under threat in\n1986\nMajor changes in College life\nhave been under consideration this\nterm. The proposed merger with St.\nMary's Medical College has brought\nfavourable reactions from most of\nthe Union and College representatives and discussions are\ncontinuing. Meanwhile, a working\nparty is investigating the possibility\nof setting up another Union\nSabbatical post, to cope with the\nincreasing workload created by the\nexpansion of the Union services.\nThe Union finally took over full\ncontrol of the Union Bar in\nSeptember and the new Holland\nClub was opened last week. A move\nless popular with the Union has\nbeen the opening of the QT snack\nbar in the JCR. It appears that the\nplanned JCR-Main Dining Hall\nswitch will not go ahead, which\nmeans that the Union will effectively\nlose its one large function room. A large section ofthe JCR will be used\nas refectory space during the\ndaytime, if the current plans are\ncarried out.\nMore Union anger was caused by\nthe notorious 'Drinking Clubs'\nmotion, with officers divided on\nwhether the three CCU clubs should\nbe banned from using Union rooms.\nThe motion was defeated, as was an\nanti-Barclays motion, but the issues\nraised caused heated debates\nthroughout College. Motions to\nsupport UL U and Amnesty's Ivan\nStarovoit, on the other hand, were\npassed with little dissent.\nThe centenary edition of the\nPhoenix was published this term,\namidst some disruption in the\nFELIX office caused by the office\nmove.

    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday November 28th1986 through with it, filling in ribs,\nmaking right arm-bones to match\nthe original left-arm bones, and\nenabling the structure to stand up,\nabout eighty percent of the\ndinosaur's frame may eventually go\non show\u2014in another year or so.\nThere are still three large blocks\nout of fifty-five to be opened, and\nthe remnants of the rock matrix to\nbe cleared in a stop-start process\nwhen at any moment the sandblaster might find itself disintegrating new bone. Apparently one can tell when bone\nis reached by changes in colour and\nhardness\u2014the fossil consists of the\nactual bone with certain minerals\ndissolved out and replaced by\nfor fish in the swamps of a river\nflood-plain (sandstones and shales\nin the area show ripple marks) or,\nless romantically, root led in the rib-cages of carcasses for the odd\ndelicacy. The fish teeth in the region\nof her stomach aren't conclusive\nevidence, but the acid-etched fish\nscales found with them are. She has\ntwice as many teeth in her lower jaw\n(sixty-four) as most dinosaurs, and\neach is so finely serrated that the\njaggedness only shows under a microscope\u2014both features of a fish-eater.\n'Claws' also had very strong arms\nfor a dinosaur of her type,\nsuggesting that she could quite\neasily have strolled along on four\nlegs. The extra-large claws, three\ntimes as large as the rest of her\nfingers, may have been on either\nhands or feet, and were probably\nused both to attack and defend.\nMilner points out that grizzly bears\nuse their claws to side-swipe passing\nfish.\nSo picture, if you will, a fifteen-foot, one-and-a half ton reptilian\nwith a crocodile smile, ambling\nleisurely on her hind legs along a river bank. Now and then she drops\nbear-like to all fours, waits a while,\nthen suddenly darts a heavily-clawed hand into the water to come\nup with a fish which she proceeds to\nswallow with enjoyment, her\narmour y of teeth making short work\nof its struggles. Also on the scene are\na couple of plant-chewing\niguanodon s. Swarms of insects,\namong them the recently discovered\ngiant dragonfly, haunt the air. Add\nthe appropriate vegetation,\nhorsetails and cycads, and there you\nhave it\u2014the world of 'Claws'.\nBaryonyx walker ei: 'Baryonyx\" comes from the Greek\nwords meaning 'heavy claw';\n'walker ei' honours its discoverer,\nW Walker.\nothers. More often it seems that\nwhat is needed is a little imagination\nand a lot of anatomy.\nThe biggest lack in this skeleton is\nthe tail, which probably parted\ncompany with 'Claws' when after\nshe died her body was washed\ndownstream in a flood. Unfortunately there are no signs of\nhow she died, or even whether she is\na 'she' or a 'he'. But the remains\nalready studied have told a great\ndeal about the lifestyle of 'Claws'.\nIndeed, they've shown such vast\ndifferences from anything so far\nseen that Charig was prepared to\n'stick my neck out and say that this\nis probably the most exciting find in\nEurope this century'. Stirring stuff,\nfor an old fossil\u2014 in this case all of\n240 million years old; it's the only\nrelatively complete dinosaur find in\nthe world from the rocks of the\nlower Cretaceous.\nPeople whose imagination was\ncaught by the nickname 'Claws'\nmay be in for a disappointment.\nTrue, she was one of the\nthera pods \u2014bipedal, carnivorous,\nTyrannosaurus rex-type dinosaurs.\nBut her skull was definitely not that\nof a hunter and killer. Her slender\nsnout, swelling at the end like that of\na crocodile and loosely jointed so\nthat she could probably waggle its\ntip, means that she probably hunted\n\n"
