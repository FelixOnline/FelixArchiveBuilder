And now, here\u2019s a\nsong: do-do-do-da-da-da-dooodo-da-da-doooooo.\u201d\nWhat you (didn\u2019t) miss, part 94\nIt\u2019s been a busy month for those of\nus staying on campus during the\nEaster break. Here\u2019s the highlights\nof the last four weeks of news.\nLibrary objections continue\nThose of you currently suffering\nteh pain of having to revise in the\nlibrary will have notice how unbearably hot the building has become as the weather has warmed\nup. In fact, temperatures in the upper floors have reached more than\n30o\nC in the last week; European\nregulations stipulate working temperatures no higher than 24o\nC.\nThe problems stem from a rejection in March by local residents of\nplans to place a new cooling plant\non the top of the library and provide\nsolar shading for the windows. The\nobjections come from people living\nin the nearby Alexandria Court,\nwhich backs onto the Library, who\nclaim that the solar shading will be\n\u201ctoo dense\u201d, whatever that means.\nCollege plan to resubmit the planning application, minus the solar\nshading proposal, but it appears\nthe residents of the \u00a32000-a-week\nflats are still unsatisfied.\nKey to the plans are the construction of a new service tower\nand cooling plant, both of which\nhave been deemed unsightly by\nresidents. It appears students will\nhave to suffer for a while longer before anything can be done.\nHot dogs in the Union?\nThe sandwich bar at lunchtime in\ndBs has been closed due to poor\nsales; staff had concocted a plan to\nturn it into a fast-food style outlet,\npossibly to compete against the\nJCR, but the Union Executive rejected the plan. Members of Exec\ncited concerns over the condition\nof dBs, which has fallen somewhat\ninto disrepair in recent months,\narguing it was too risky to invest\nin new catering facilities without\nsome major changes to the ambience in room. It received a repainting during the summer, but recent\nfoam parties have played havok\nwith the wooden floor.\nThe fast-food outlet would have\nsold burgers, hotdogs, and Ben &\nJerrys icecream between 10am\nand 3pm every day; however, the\nsame offers are to be put in place\nA round-up of all the news over the Easter break; library objections, hot dogs, Union catering, and more\nSneaky Bifter next door in Da Vinci\u2019s.\nUnion catering has suffered since\nthe new JCR facilities opened, with\nboth dBs and Da Vinci\u2019s being nowhere near as full as they used to\nbe at lunchtimes. The scary-look-ing mascot outside may not help to\ndraw in more customers.\nBar staff under threat\nStudent staff who work behind the\nbar will no longer be offered any\nfurther shifts if they take part in\nany Union committees, following\nrecent events.\nThe ban appears to have arisen\nfrom recent friction between staff\nand the Executive Committee,\nwho voted to shut down dBs at\nlunchtime after it became clear\nit was making a substantial loss,\nand vetoed the rescue plan (see\nabove). Any student who attends\nCouncil or Exec, even if they are\nnot a member of either, risks not\nbeing offered any more shifts.\nBar staff count as \u2018casual staff\u2019,\nand as such have little legal recourse to being effectively \u2018fired\u2019.\nUnion President John Collins has\npromised to investigate the mat-ter, commenting: \u201cSpeaking gen-erally, I would regard any proposal\nto limit the rights of student staff\nto attend open union meetings to\nbe unacceptable and against the\ndemocratic principles of our Union.\u201d Other senior Union sources\nhave called the action \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cappalling\u201d.\nThe reasoning behind the move\nappears to be a distaste by staff for\nstudents setting policy that may\naffect their jobs.\nPolice examine Union\u2019s licence\nThe authority responsible for policing licences to sell alcohol have\nvisited the Union bars and Holland\nClub, citing concerns over who\nis being served in the bars. After\nthe shake-up of licensing laws two\nyears ago, the police force are now\nresponsible for checking up on licenced premises.\nOstensibly the Union is a mem-Hotter than most holiday destinations\nbers\u2019 club, meaning it should only\nserve drinks to its members. This\nincludes every student at the College who hasn\u2019t opted out of Union membership. However, until\nrecently the police had adopted a\n\u2018softly-softly\u2019 approach to this rule,\nallowing regular drinkers from the\nlocal area, including staff at the\nNatural History Museum, the Science Museum, and residents, to\ndrink there freely.\nIt appears that this period of\ngrace may be ending. After the\npolice visit, the bars now sport\nsigns (on the advice of the Union\u2019s solicitors) reminding patrons\nthat alcohol is only to be served to\nmembers and their guests, as well\nas members of affiliated unions.\nThe solicitors have also argued\nthat if a person looks of student\nage and appearance, that there is\nno reason to assume they are not\na student.\nThe reason for the change of\napproach to the Union\u2019s licenced\npremises is not entirely clear. One\nUnion official who wished not to be\nnamed suggested a reason: that\nthe huge backlog of cases relating to the change in licencing laws\nseveral years ago has now been\ncleared, and the departments\nset up to deal with this now have\n\u201cnothing better to do\u201d.\nThe risk is that police will not accept the signage and arguments\nof the Union\u2019s solicitors about due\ndiligence, and will force the bar\nstaff to request student ID from\nevery customer, irritating students\nand increasing waiting times at\nthe bar. For the moment, however,\nthe police seem satisfied with the\nchanges made.\nQueen\u2019s Lawn unusable?\nFelix has heard from various\nsources that the enormous tent on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn is to remain a permanent fixture until at least October. This means staff and students\nwill be unable to use the lawn during the sunny months to come.\nWith the controversy last year\nover plans to place portacabins on\nthe lawn, it is somewhat shocking\nthat no consultation was carried\nout with staff or students.\nQueen\u2019s Lawn is one of the few\nremaining green spaces on South\nKensington campus, and it is indeed odd that this should be covered up during Imperial\u2019s Centenary year. More on this next week.\nThe tent, which covers almost the entirety of the lawn\nPHOTO BY LIVE!\nPHOTO BY EMERSON VIGOUREUX\nA child with his head stuck in the railings in Kensington Gardens; it\ntook firefighters almost an hour to free the unhappy kid, to the great\namusement of the crowd that gathered to watch.\n2 felix Friday 27 April 2007\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCENTRE PAGES\nPHOTO\nBY\nJON\nSMITH\n\n"

    "content": "I, Gamer\nI\n\u2019m not a big fan of water\nin games. Not because\nthey\u2019re badly done or anything \u2013 although that\u2019s\nusually true, too. Simply\nbecause they terrify me. It\u2019s\nthe lack of control, the murky\ndarkness, and the cutscene\nthat every single game has to\nhave where you get shown the\nevil fishlike hellspawn that\u2019s\nwaiting in there to eat you.\nThis week, though, I\u2019m\nfeeling slightly anti-water in\nthe real world. In fact, Felix\nGames comes to you this week\nin exile, an editorial forced out\nof its natural surroundings by\na burst radiator pipe. Ceiling\nleaking, cupboards soaked,\ncomputer barely saved. We\nlost a lot of good men back\nthere.\nThankfully, being a little\nworn around the edges doesn\u2019t\ndo much harm, and so we\u2019ve\nmanaged to get you something\nto look at despite the more\ndamp surroundings. In fact,\nthis term we\u2019re all about being\nworn around the edges, as we\ndelve into charity shops, eBay\nand our own misspent youth\nto uncover the great games of\nyesteryear that really deserve\na second go.\nWe\u2019re hoping to have a\nrun down of a host of great\nemulation and mod remakes,\na chance to win yourself some\nof the best-loved classics, and\nour personal experiences of\nthose huge gaming monoliths.\nAs well as our retro theme,\nwe\u2019ll be covering Imperial\u2019s\nthird Games and Media Event,\nhosted by the Department of\nComputing in May, and hopefully beginning a new regular\nfor this term, as we explore\nthe greatest MMOs out there\n- with fresh eyes.\nAnd, as always, we\u2019re looking for new submissions, new\nideas, and interesting gamers\nout there at Imperial who have\nsomething to share. Competitive? Creative? Do you loathe\neverything that adorns these\npages? We don\u2019t care where\nyou want us to shove our Wiimotes, just let us know.\nFor now, though, I\u2019m trying\nto locate my Oblivion disc so I\ncan have a mid-exams break\nin Tamriel. Bear with us as the\nwriters, editors and whatnot\ngo through that tricky period\nof flagellation and prayer\nknown as examinations, and\nremember to take fifteen-minute breaks for each hour\nof revision. Or a fifteen-minute\nbreak of revision from every\nhour of gaming.\nHell, something like that.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n12 felix Friday 27 April 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis Week in Videogames\nO\nf all the demographic\ngroups you could\u2019ve\npinned into a political situation, gamers\nseem to be the least\nobvious candidates. When Rock or\nPunk had their turn in the limelight\nof public disapproval, they were\nready for it. For gamers, many of\nthem barely look up from World of\nWarcraft.\nAnd yet, represented or not,\nthere\u2019s a lot of discussion going on\nlately. Did the latest American high\nschool shooter have contact with\nvideogames? None were found in\nhis apartment, but that didn\u2019t stop\nthe Washington Post from linking\nCho Seung Hi to the popular online\nFPS CounterStrike.\nAnd that means Jack Thompson.\nSo over the pond, they\u2019re left\nwith court battles, wild claims, and\nsolemn moruning. But back home,\nthere\u2019s a entirely new attitude being\ntaken towards games and gamers.\nThe British Board of Film Classification published the results of a\nlarge survey and collated research\ninto the game playing habits of UK\ngamers. Whilst the BBFC only have\nto personally review 7% of games\nreleases annually, due to European\nUnion classification, they remain\nthe definitive governing body on the\ncountry\u2019s media.\nTheir findings were unusual, to\nsay the least, and hold a lot of credibility coming as they do from such a\nwell-established official body. They\nrange from the slightly obvious\nstatements \u2013 \u201cgamers play games\nbecause they enjoy it\u201d is stated at\none point \u2013 to the less expected. And\nwhilst some of their phrasing raises\na smirk, such as their attempt to\nreclassify the re-re-releases of The\nSims series as \u201cstrategic life simulation\u201d, a lot of their work will be\nfundamental in the ongoing media\nrow over violence in videogames.\nThe area of the report focusing on\nviolence discusses the matter with\nvarious groups of gamers, ranging\nfrom gaming parents through to\nnon-gaming youngsters, and everything in between. Their conclusions\nare very different to reports previ-ous, in particular those conducted\nby the BBC and the British School\nof Motoring. Gaming is a less im-mersive medium, according to the\nreport, and as such gamers tend to\nkeep a better grip on reality.\nThey also suggest that violence\nin games is often \u201csymbolic\u201d and\nusually necessary to make a game\ndesign flow properly. They highlight\nthe stigma associated with such\ngames, but say that their findings\n\u201cmake the incidence of violence in\ngames more comprehensible\u201d.\nWhilst the teacup storms in the\nStates are unlikely to spill over onto\nBritish soil, it\u2019s comforting to know\nthat our own classification system\nKillings in America, J. Thompson, and GTA \u2013 but the BBFC defends UK gamers\nunderstands the gaming psyche\nproperly, and has a more balanced\nview on events than many others.\nWhether this research helps the\nview of gaming and gamers remains to be seen \u2013 we don\u2019t hold out\nmuch hope that it will \u2013 but as far as\nofficial conclusions go, gamers are\nmore than happy to accept this one.\nMost telling is what lies in the last\npages, after a large section devoted\nto parental concerns on gaming,\nwhere violence is cited among other\nconcerns. At the end of the report, it\nexplains that many parents have a\n\u201cdefeatist\u201d attitude to classification,\nand many suffer from \u201cignorance\u201d\nthat leads to inappropriate material\nbeing given to their children.\nAnd it\u2019s this reason that the BBFC\nbelieves that some regulation may\nbe necessary \u2013 \u201cbecause parents\ncannot be expected to play games\nthemselves and come to their own\njudgements\u201d. They quote one par-ent, saying, \u201cWe bought him GTA\nwhen he was almost 10\u201d.\nWhether that\u2019s a comment on the\nlaziness of parents, or the impossibility of the situation, remains to\nbe seen, but the BBFC suggest that\none of the biggest issues remaining is that non-gamers simply don\u2019t\n\u201cget\u201d games.\n\u201cWhen Keith Vaz, for example, is\ntalking about taste, nowhere in the\nguidelines that have been set by\neither PEGI or BBFC is taste mentioned\u201d, says one industry profes-sional, in a quote which closes the\nreport. \u201cWhat is taste? \u2026 It is very\ndifficult.\u201d\nJack Thompson, yesterday. But the Florida attorney\u2019s attempts to ban violent games are failing in the UK\n\u201c... gamers seem not to lose awareness that\nthey are playing a game and do not mistake\nthe game for real life.\u201d\nfrom the BBFC\nreport, \u201cVideo Games\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "O\nn the evening of\nThursday 22nd March\nmost of the squad\nmet at Ved, Subby\nand Jib\u2019s house for a\npre-tour party until we began our\njourney out to Thailand at 5am.\nI spent the first part of the night\nworking in the IC Library, which\nwas still brimming with activity\nwhen I packed up just after 3am.\nBeing Imperial this wasn\u2019t very\nsurprising; however it was still\namusing enough to take a few\nphotos. After a couple of hours at\nJib\u2019s we caught a couple of buses\nto Victoria, hopped to Gatwick and\nbegan the check-in process for\nQatar Airways. Though inevitably\nstressful, being a London air-port, it didn\u2019t take long and we\nall boarded our flight happily at\n9am. Two long, 7 hour flights later,\nwith a short stopover in Doha, we\nwere approaching Bangkok over\nmisty striped rural landscapes and\nvillages. My sleep on the second\nflight: 4.5 hours.\nFinally we arrived in Bangkok,\nearly, to be greeted by hotel staff\nand transport. Our first road journey from the airport to the city centre was quite an experience, but\nsomething we would end up getting\nvery used to. There is no concept\nof road safety in Thailand, and everything from seatbelts to any form\nof vehicle regulation seemed to be\nlacking. Our accommodation was\n5 star and from my 31st floor room\nthere were beautiful views of central Bangkok. After our early arrival\nwe were fed thanks to the kindness\nof Ved\u2019s Mother and Brother, who\nlive locally. We spent the remainder\nof the day soaking up the sights and\nsmells of our area: our clothes did\nmost of the soaking, as our predominantly UK bred bodies weren\u2019t very\naccustomed to 38\u02daC humid heat!\nThe open air pool was much en-joyed; it was on the 11th floor, that\u2019s\nthe same height as the EE building\n- if only we had a pool up there too!\nThat evening I went in the wrong\ndirection on the SkyTrain, a fast and\nclean method of transport built on\n15 metre concrete plinths above the\nmain streets. Eventually finding\nmy way to Siam Paragon (Siam is\na common name in Thailand, as it\nwas the country\u2019s former name), a\nlarge western style shopping mall\nand cinema, we enjoyed a game of\nbowling and tasty (and extremely\ncheap) Thai food before calling it a\nday. My sleep that night: 6.5 hours.\nOn Sunday we had an early start\nto play our first match. It was to be\nour first day of cricket and was to be\na one-day friendly game against the\nRoyalBangkokSportsClub(RBSC).\nI got up at 6:30am to have a wander\nand take a few photos before it started to get too hot. The streets were\nbrimming with life even that early\nin the morning - it seems the city\ndoesn\u2019t sleep, or maybe it doesn\u2019t\nwork so hard during the day! The\nbeauty of the RBSC ground was\nsimply breathtaking; skyscrapers\nlined the boundaries and a horse\nracing track circled the field. This\nwould be a memorable day for all,\nbut particularly for fresher\u2019s Ali\nand Omair who made their Imperial\ndebuts. We enjoyed a good 35 over\ngame, though playing in 39\u02daC was\nan experience some of us coped\nwith better than others! I was particularly impressed by Shiraz who\nkept wicket for 3 hours and then\nwent straight in to open the batting.\nHowever, Almaher and Ved were\nthe stars of the show with a 5 wicket\nhaul and 36 runs respectively.\nAfter being stranded in a Sri\nLankan airport for 26 hours,\nAbeetha finally joined us and we\nchilled at the hotel; a few of us went\nfor a swim, and some of the less\ntired members of the squad ate out\nlocally. Food and drink in Thailand\nis very cheap, costing less than \u00a32\nfor a very good meal. My sleep that\nnight: 5 hours.\nMonday saw an early departure\nfrom the Hotel to catch our 7:30am\nflight to Phuket Island. We enjoyed\nthe low cost \u2018Nok Airlines\u2019 with its\nbeak nosed planes and falling-to-pieces seats. Towards the end of\nour 2 hour flight we began to descend and the clouds cleared we\nwere treated to spectacular views\nof the peninsula and surrounding\nIslands. Jagged and steep mountains were shrouded in low cloud\nand mist and surrounded by dense\njungle. The plane landed successfully to cheers from the squad, and\ncars drove the distance to our hotel\nin the touristy Patong resort. That\nafternoon we ate at a small Indian\nplace that played some classic Bollywood tunes favoured by some of\nthe lads. Some of the squad then\nenjoyed a local massage, all sticking to (mostly) innocent activities,\nbefore descending down to the\nbeach to Jetski. In the evening we\nenjoyed the delights of Patong: pizza and some \u201cspeciality dancing\u201d.\nMy sleep that night: 4.5 hours.\nWe had another early morning on\nTuesday as we departed the hotel to\ncatch a boat to the Phi Phi Islands.\nThis beautiful collection of Islands\nabout 30 miles off Phuket rise up out\nof the water vertically, like something out of a film set. In fact, they\nhave hosted many film sets. Our\nboat tour was very touristy, but that\ndidn\u2019t stop us enjoying the sights,\nincluding flying fish and monkeys.\nAfter a stopover at Phi Phi, we visited two snorkelling locations. The\nfirst one was close enough to one\nof the desert island beaches, with\npesky monkeys prancing about in\nthe sand. I swam straight to it, and\nafter helping a monkey unscrew the\ntop of a half full bottle of fresh water,\nwatched it drink and dared to pet its\nhead. A few moments later the boys\narrived but all stood in a huddle a\nfew metres off shore, saying they\nhad been warned about the vicious\nmonkeys! In all fairness though, a\nfew minutes later the monkeys did\nget into a fight which made WrestleMania look like a children\u2019s puppet\nshow. We were allowed to explore\nthe main island, Phi Phi, after lunch\nand played with a Nerf ball on one\nof the most beautiful beaches we\u2019d\never seen. After returning to Patong\nwe enjoyed some fiercely contested\nbeach cricket in the setting sun. Unsportsmanlike behaviour from Imperial B led to the early dismissal of\ncaptain, Thil; controversy arose and\nsoon false allegations of match fixing were being hurled at club presidents Anura and Jibran. A crowd of\nspectators began to gather as local\nresidents wondered why a group of\nEnglishmen kept hitting a ball out\ninto the ocean and running like old\nladies at an M&S sale. We made no\neffort to explain. After returning to\nthe hotel, some of the squad went\nout for another massage and some\ndrinks - hardcore stuff to follow up\n4 near-sleepless nights! My sleep\nthat night: 6.5 hours.\nWednesday was our day of departure from Phuket and Leon and I\ngot up at 6am to go for a morning\nstroll. As soon as we found a local\npath into the hills it became a bit\nmore than a morning stroll, and we\nended up exploring many miles into\nthe jungle. As we got deeper, the\nnoise was deafening, some insects\nso loud they caused our ears to res-onate! We saw many ant trails and\nlarge flying insects, as well as some\nlocals who lived up the hill. That\nafternoon some of the squad went\nparagliding, and then we made the\ntrip back to the airport and then\nback to Bangkok thanks again to\nNok-Air. Upon returning to the hotel we turned in for an early night,\nready for the tournament the next\nday. Thil treated us to a team talk\nabout what to expect of the 6-a-side\ntournament and some of the squad\nwent out. My sleep that night: 6.5\nhours.\nOn Thursday morning we had\nour first round of matches, three of\nwhich were before lunch. Our pitch\nthis time was at another of the RBSC\u2019s picturesque grounds; this time\nsporting a jogging track and three\nluxury swimming pools. Imperial\nA were quickly taken aback by the\nquality of the opposition we were\nfacing. Despite the international\nteams we were up against, we put\nup a good fight and narrowly missed\nout on a spot in the knockout stage\nof the tournament. In honesty we\nwere outplayed by the better batting of the opposition. We could only\nwatch in admiration as the batsmen\nof Bahrain, Maldives and Calcutta\nlaunched ball after ball beyond the\nboundary. After completing our\nCricket Club ventures to Thailand\nI wonder how many times these boys did the Bangkok joke before it got old and too painful.\n18 felix Friday 27 April 2007\nNEWS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNick Adams &\nJibran Ahmed\nBangkok greets our cricketers, who enjoy the hospitality of the locals and receive some \u2018innocent massages\u2019\n\n"

If I could\noffer you one tip for the\nfuture, it would be this:\ndo some damn work. The\nlong term benefits of doing some\nwork have been proved by scien-tists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more than my\nown meandering experience.\nOrganise your notes, but don\u2019t\norganise your day. Sleep well. Go\nto the library, but leave before\nit makes you dehydrated; go to\nthe pub, but leave before you get\ndrunk. Floss. Be kind to your brain;\nyou\u2019ll miss it when it\u2019s gone. Don\u2019t\nwaste your time on panicking;\nsometimes you\u2019re ahead of sched-ule, and sometimes you\u2019re behind.\nGet plenty of water. Keep hold of\nthe few precious revision buddies\nyou have, and always remember\nthat notes are for sharing. Work\nhard, but remember to play harder\nonce it\u2019s all over. Don\u2019t forget that\nit will all be over at some point.\nShower. Regularly. And I do\nmean it. Remember the equations\nyou learn, but forget the deriva-tions. Worry about the big things,\nnot the little things. Eat well. Get\nto know your lecturers; they can\ngive you valuable hints about what\nmight be on the paper. Past papers\nare your friends; look at as many\nof them as you can.\nAcceptcertaininalienabletruths;\nyour notes will be unintelligable,\nwhat you\u2019ve learned the most will\nnot be on the exam, and you can\u2019t\nalways answer every question. Be\nhappy. Respect the upper years;\nthey know more than you.\nMaybe you\u2019ll pass, maybe you\nwon\u2019t. Don\u2019t be afraid of failure;\nhope for success. Don\u2019t worry\nabout the exam; or, if you must\nworry, remember that worrying is\nabout as effective as trying to solve\nan equation by chewing gum.\nAdvice is a form of nostalgia,\ndispensing it is a way of fishing\nthe past from the disposal, wiping\nit off, painting over the ugly parts\nand recycling it for more than it\u2019s\nworth. But trust me on the doing\nof work.\n(With apologies to Baz Luhrmann\n& Mary Schmich)\nDon\u2019t panic! Listen to us elderly folks down Felix way, and we\u2019ll show you how to survive the coming weeks\nThe three Ws: Work, Work, and... uhm, Work\nAs a doctor, I am often asked: \u201cDoctor, my palms are sweating profuse-ly, my stomach is rotating rapidly\ndespite not eating anything since\nthat chicken\u2019n\u2019bacon yesterday,\nand I have a tense, nervous headache like that one in the adverts.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Fear not,\nmy less-well-educated chum; you\ndo not have cancer (or even her-pes, though you might want to get\nthose weird spots checked outt).\nNo, indeed, you have a classic case\nof exam stress, commonly known\nas ohshitiamfuckeditis. Now, due\nto my colossal knowledge acquired\nas an undergraduate (inbetween\ndrinking myself into a stupor in the\nReynolds Bar), I can suggest to you\na number of possible treatment op-tions. Listen closely, ignoramus.\nRELAX.\nNot in the \u2018Frankie Goes To Hollywood\u2019 sense (incidentally, did you\nknow that song is about orgasms?),\nbut in the \u2018be calm\u2019 sense. It\u2019s easy\nto get into a mad panic because\nThe Doctor (is in)\nyou don\u2019t know equation 11.4 from\nlecture 87 of your structural fluid\nmechanics with quantum misdirection course and lose sight of the fact\nthat (hopefully) you know plenty of\nother stuff about said subject. If\nyou find yourself getting panicked,\ntry calmly reminding yourself how\nmuch work you\u2019ve already done.\nTake a break, go for a walk in the\npark, phone your mum. Then come\nback to your books refreshed and\nready to go.\nPLAN.\nI can\u2019t stress this one enough. Even\nif you aren\u2019t one of nature\u2019s plan-ners, try it. Write out a list of what\nneeds to be learnt, and how long\nyou think it\u2019ll take you to do it (plus\na chunky fudge factor, since work\nalways expands to fill the available\ntime). That way you\u2019ll have a nice\nmental picture of how much you\u2019ve\ngot to do.\nEAT.\nYes, I know it seems redundant. It\u2019s\neasy to forget to eat properly because skipping out for lunch would\nmean stepping away from those\nnever-ending reams of notes, but\nyou can\u2019t function on snacks from\nFacebook\nAs addictive as crack-laced\nheroin rolled into a cigarette.\nStudies have shown it will eat\nup roughly 75% of your revision time; writing inanities on\nyour friends\u2019 walls can be very\ntime-consuming. Just say no.\nXbox/Wii/DS/Gameboy/PS2\nSince this is a pretty geeky\nplace, it\u2019s likely you own one\nof the above. However tempting it may be to try and finish\nNew Super Mario Bros (finding\nall the secrets), resist. You\u2019ll\nfind your day vanishes faster\nthan you can say \u201coh fuck I\u2019ve\ndone no work at all\u201d.\nAlcohol\nDon\u2019t spend all day building\nup neural connections only to\nburn them all away with a six-hour cider binge that ends with\nyou losing your notes (and\nyour shoes) in the park (true\nstory).\nDenial\nNot just a river in Egypt (snare\nroll). Thanks, I\u2019ll be here all\nweek. The biggest revision\nkiller by far.

Trust me on this one. See\nthe opposite page for some things\nto try. Remember, crisps, Coke,\nSnickers and coffee do not constitute food groups.\nSLEEP\n.\nStaying up all night doesn\u2019t help,\nand may in fact hamper your ability to work. Try to get to bed at a\nregular time, and rise at roughly\nthe same time every day. If you\u2019re\nfeeling adventurous (and have no\nlectures to go to) you can try something called polyphasic sleep. Basically, you adjust so that you sleep\nfor 20-25 minutes every four hours,\ngiving you six naps through the day\nand night. Theoretically, this should\ngive you more time to work, and\nmost tiredness should dissipate\nafter about ten days. I managed it\nonce for a week before crumbling.\nSEX.\nSex fills your brain full of dopamine,\nand makes you feel generally awesome \u2013 just what you need. However, this is Imperial, so we won\u2019t\nassume you\u2019ll be with a partner.\nJust remember to wash your hands\nafterwards.\nDon\u2019t sleep in the library, you filthy bugger.

The 13\nstrong squad went on a 10 day tour\nof Thailand where we competed in\nthe Royal Bangkok Sports Club Sixes\nTournament featuring international\nteams such as Bahrain and Maldives. Despite the stiff opposition and\nintense heat, one of Imperial\u2019s teams\nmade it to the quarter finals of the\nPlate competition.\nThe tour began with a warm up\nmatch against the Royal Bangkok\nSports Club \u2013 one of the best league\nteams in Thailand. Upon arrival at\nthe ground, any tiredness was very\nquickly overcome by sentiment; the\nground was easily one the most beautiful any of us had ever played on.\nLush green pitches were surrounded\nby palm trees with a backdrop of towering skyscrapers and cloudless blue\nskies. Simply put, the grounds were\ntruly magnificent.\nUnder the roasting mid-day sun the\nmatch was soon underway. RBSC\nwon the toss and elected to bat first.\nThey got off to a flyer but Imperial\nsoon gained control as Jibran Ahmed\nmade good use of the new ball to take\ntwo quick wickets \u2013 despite his injured knee. Ali Ahmed made the perfect start to his Imperial debut with\nan early wicket while The pressure\ncontinued to build as Leon Loveridge\nclaimed an early victim while skipper\nThil set the standard with an incredible diving catch followed shortly by\na run out.\nDespite the early breakthrough,\nthe runs kept flowing and the game\nwas beginning to get away from us\n\u2013 that is until Almaher Shelley was\nhanded the ball. Al bowled a selection\nof jaffers and wides leading to an impressive 5 wicket haul. RBSC struggled to cope with Al\u2019s potent mix of\npace, swing and slower balls; one\nby one the sound of the ball striking\nthe stumps sent the batsmen walking back to the pavilion. RBSC were\nbowled out in 34 overs leaving Imperial the daunting task of chasing 241\nin just 35 overs.\nAfter tucking into our fried rice at\ntea (some of us enjoying more than\none serving i.e. Anura) we set off to\nthe crease but never managed to\nstamp our authority. Wickets tumbled and some dodgy calling from\nAl ensured he was no contender for\nman of the match as he intentionally\nran-out the captain. The only real resistance came from Leon Loveridge\nand Ved Vyas who both batted with\ngreat responsibility to keep the opponents on their toes. In fact Ved clearly wasn\u2019t intending on batting very\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is; why such nice boys are prancing around in the middle of the day dressed only in their pyjamas.\nxkcd www.xkcd.com\nlong as he decided that boxers alone\nwould suffice to keep his abdominal\nguard in place until he was out. This\noption proved painful as he dived into\nhis crease avoiding a run-out. This\nwas only the first of Ved\u2019s abdominal\nguard problems during the tour.\nImperial were all out for 143 as Nick\nclaimed Leon was trapped \u201cplumb\u201d\nin front the wickets. Ved top scored\nwith an impressive innings of 36 on\nhis home ground and Leon finished\nwith a respectable 26. Although we\nwere up against strong opposition,\nwe put up a good fight and showed\ngreat resilience, however, we never\nmanaged to get a hold of the game\nand the opposition\u2019s suitability to the\nconditions took the match out of our\nhands.\nContinued on inside page\nJibran Ahmed &\nThilina Ambepitiya\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cBaa / ribbit \u2013 what a scorcher!\u201d\nThe incredible case of the dying frogs and the shrinking sheep. Whodunnit \u2013 climate change you say?\nAs many of you are no doubt aware,\nthe climate is changing, the world\nis getting hotter, and our cheap\nholiday flights are just as much to\nblame as all those polluting indus-tries. The most recent IPCC report tells us these climate changes\ncould lead to the extinction of up to\n30% of all plants and animals. An\nappalling projection, no doubt, but\neven if the world is not stripped of\none third of its biodiversity, several\nless dramatic changes are certainly in store. Even if they\u2019re gradual\nenough that we don\u2019t notice them,\nover time they will probably have a\nserious influence on the lives of the\nremaining species.\nDr Tim Coulson, from Imperial\u2019s\nDivision of Biology, says that global\nwarming is leaving an evolutionary signature in the planet\u2019s spe-cies: \u201cWe are probably changing\npatterns of selection and this could\nwell result in small-scale evolutionary change\u201d. Some of these\nchanges are described in a paper\nhe published in the journal Science,\ntogether with researchers from the\nUniversities of Cambridge, Edinburgh and Stanford. They studied\na population of Soay sheep in the\nOuter Hebrides, and found evidence that temperature influences\nthe size of the animals.\nIn a warmer environment, it\nseems there is less of an advantage\nto being a large sheep \u2013 it doesn\u2019t\nmatter so much if the animal is\nsmaller. After several generations,\nthe result is a general reduction\nin body size. With this paper, scientists were able to prove that\nclimate change can alter genetic\ncharacteristics.\nSome animals\u2019 behaviour is also\nmodified, explains Dr Coulson. \u201cOn\nthe island of Rum, we have seen red\ndeer giving birth to their calves earlier in the year. There are probably\nmany other such changes, but in\norder to pick them up you need detailed individual-based data \u2013 and\nsuch data are rare.\u201d While all living\nbeings do their best to adapt to the\nnew conditions, in some cases they\ndon\u2019t have anywhere to run. Quite\nliterally. \u201cWhile animals and plants\nhave adapted to past climate shifts\nby moving to more suitable habitats,\ntheir options are now much more\nlimited because of the conversion\nof so many ecosystems to uses such\nas cities and intensive agriculture\u201d\nsays Ahmed Djoghlaf, head of the\nConvention on Biological Diversity,\nin a column on the BBC website.\nBut shrinking mammals and altered mating schedules won\u2019t be\nthe only consequence of climate\nchange. There\u2019s also a fungal dis-ease, deadly to amphibians, which\nwill thrive in the hot weather. According to Dr Matthew Fisher, from\nImperial\u2019s department of EpidemiA Soay sheep. Baa. Warmer climates mean larger sheep don\u2019t enjoy\nan especial evolutionary advantage, so average sheep size dimishes.\nology, contamination by the fungus\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis\n(Bd) is nothing less than one of the\nmost potent threats to biodiversity\nyet discovered: .\nLast year, researchers from Imperial College and two Madrid Institutions proved that the increase\nin temperatures is responsible for\nthe virtual extinction of the midwife toad in a mountain region of\nSpain. They showed that 26 years of\nincreasing temperatures led to the\nemergence of the chytrid fungus Bd\nin the area. The disease affects the\nability of amphibian skin to absorb\nwater and is causing a huge number\nof deaths among frogs, toads, salamanders and newts worldwide.\n\u201cThis is a wake-up call that we are\nlosing biodiversity fast,\u201d said Dr.\nFisher. \u201cClimate change appears to\nbe changing patterns of disease and\npreviously resistant species are becoming highly infected \u2013 even, in\na number of cases, becoming extinct.\u201d The Global Amphibian Assessment has warned that a third\nof the world\u2019s amphibian species\nare in danger of extinction, many\nbecause of the chytrid fungus.\nWe are already changing diseases and evolutionary patterns,\nand nobody knows exactly what the\nresults will be, but it\u2019s likely the effects will be more widespread then\nwe can imagine. \u201cAs the Millennium\nEcosystem Assessment pointed\nout in 2005, reduction of biodiversity implies a threat to services\nas basic as the provision of food,\nfibre, medicines and fresh water,\nthe pollination of crops and protection from flooding,\u201d warns Ahmed\nDjoghlaf. It will be a very different\nworld \u2013 here\u2019s hoping we\u2019re one of\nthe species which are able to adapt,\nto witness what we\u2019ve unleashed..\nAmphibians are at risk from the Chytrid fungus, which affects their skin\u2019s ability to absorb water. As\nclimate change raises temperatures, the fungus\u2019 spread may threaten many species with extinction\n5\nfelix\nFriday 27 April 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBarbara Axt Portella\nWant to see your work published here?\nEmail science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Much in the\nsame way that everyone\nloves Bruce Forsyth, or the\nAndrex puppy. You might\npretend to hate the bland sci-fi, or\nthe shallow tactics, or the aged,\nbackwards ideas about resource\ncollection. You might just never play\ngames. But deep down, in a long-forgotten neural region, encoded in\nsome primitive genetic sequence,\nthere\u2019s an instinct that\u2019s dedicated\nto the tank rush.\nWhy? Why is it so popular? And\nwhy, with the release of Tiberium\nWars this April, is it still so popu-lar? Because as a counterpoint to\nthe above raving, even the biggest\nfan of the real-time strategy series\ngenerally accepts that the story is\n\u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d. They understand\nthat it has all the tactical nuances of\ndropping a Grand Piano on Wile E.\nCoyote. They accept that the game\u2019s\ninsistence on the harvest-build-at-tack cycle is older than the hills.\nBut Jesus. The tank rushes.\nAnd you know, it wasn\u2019t always\ntanks either. Memorably, I once\nstormed a NOD stronghold with\nover a hundred freedom-fighting,\nterrorist-shooting, press-upping\nmachine gunners once. The Prodigy got it wrong \u2013 you need to be\nnever outgunned, and never out-numbered. The feeling of safety in\nnumbers, as well as the hive-mind\npower of pointy-pointy-click-click\nisometric control, is comforting.\nAnd powerful. You float high above\nthe war, beyond it, clicking and\nwatching shapes move, swiftly and\nrighteously. You indicate the target\nof a nuclear weapon with a thoughtless press of a mouse. Apocalypse\nensues.\nWhy does it still figure now? For\nsheer tactical depth, it\u2019s hard to beat\nthe Total War series, and games like\nSupreme Commander and Company Of Heroes both do macro- and\nmicro-destruction almost to perfec-tion. So why should Command and\nConquer still be a worthy series,\neven at this old age?\nIn some ways, it\u2019s a respect thing.\nIn the same way we pretend to be\ngood at football, because we believe\nwe invented it, maybe Command\nand Conquer\u2019s success is in part\ndue to feeling sorry that the inventor of so many gaming standards\nhas got long in the tooth.\nBut it\u2019s more likely because Command and Conquer refuses to be\nmoved by trends in gaming. Instead, it sticks to its guns and fulfils\nthe idea of revolution, rather than\nevolution.\nFrom the original game - which is\nstill just about playable today - the\nemphasis was on a certain style\nof play. But whereas some series\nchange direction dramatically, Command and Conquer understood its\nstrengths as well as its weaknesses,\nand preferred to streamline its running rather than add in strange new\nfeatures. Even with its latest re-lease, the hugely popular Tiberium\nWars, there is much that harks back\nto the old days.\nIts intentional, too. From the\nhammy video cutscenes that introduce each mission \u2013 with a proud\nhistory of Michael Ironside, James\nEarl Jones, Michael Ironside, and\nsome bint from Battlestar Galactica\n\u2013 through to the use of some of the\nsame sound effects from ten years\nago, the game constantly pays respects to its history.\nThis comes through in the way\nyou play. Because although the\nscale and beauty of a Supreme\nCommander endgame is undeniably impressive, there\u2019s a feeling of\npilgrimage every time you sit down\nto begin Command and Conquer\u2019s\noriginal GDI campaign from the\nbeginning.\n\u201cAre you pickin\u2019 this up? Good.\u201d\nThe guy looks like something out\nof Toy Story, and speaks in a similar\nway, yet you\u2019re transported instantly back to the time you saw him first.\nAnd when that map flickers up, and\nyou see the hovercraft, the glittering seas, the tiny, blocky little turret\nthat\u2019s putting away at your men.\nWell, it is instinctive.\nMaybe it\u2019s genuinely something\ntrue of any kind of \u201cretro\u201d gaming,\nbut C&C feels stripped down, and\npure. There\u2019s no rotatable camera,\nor day and night cycle. You don\u2019t\nneed to consider terrain types, or\nthe morale of your men. All you\nneed to do is get a truckload of cash,\nand build as many of the biggest,\nmetal-coated, fire-spewing things\nthat you can.\nAnd then you go to war.\nBut there\u2019s nothing like Command\nand Conquer\u2019s war, because it gave\nbirth to the clich\u00e9s that we now hate\n\u2013 there\u2019s a reason it feels repetitive\nand samey now, and that\u2019s because\nother games have made it so. When\nyou first played the commando mis-sions, quipping and walking your\nway through a carefully-designed\nmaze, it was new. It was great fun.\nOnce it featured in every fictional war between 1997 and now, it\nstopped being fun.\nBecause it worked so well. Because you didn\u2019t need to \u201cget\u201d anything in order to play it. It was at\nthe level of simplicity that Pac-Man\nhad, that Pong had. It taught you\ntactics as if it knew how big the genre would become in ten years time.\nIt gave you a helping hand up so\nyou wouldn\u2019t feel left behind when\nWarcraft III came along.\nIt\u2019s on a Micro Machines level of\nOh, the pixelly cliffs. The blobbly men. The phallic structure design. The slight irritation at building silos\nKane, played by Joseph Kucan who also directs a lot of the video shown in the series, is one of PC gaming\u2019s best-known bad guys.\nThinking of playing the golden\nRTS series again? Old C&C games\nare rare to find preowned, but on\neBay you can pick up the original or the sequel, Red Alert, for\naround a fiver each.\nHowever, what with it being\na decade old this year, EA have\nre-released the entire series,\nfrom the original through to the\ncontemporary Generals, and\nthat can be picked up as a lot for\nabout \u00a319.99 - though the current\nrelease is somewhat shaky, and\nrequires some patching.\nsimplicity, and that\u2019s why everyone\nloves it. That\u2019s why you pluck a nomadic group out of the Amazonian\nrainforest, put them in front of a\n150MHz PC, and within two hours\nthey\u2019ll be overrunning your base\nwith engineers and flame tanks. It\u2019s\nbecause Command and Conquer\ndoesn\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t want you\nto play Rock-Paper-Scissors with\nheavy cavalry and bald guys with\ncatapaults. It just wants you to build\nthings that explode and then make\nthem do just that.\nThere\u2019s been a lot said about the\nstrategy genre lately, about how Medieval 2 and Supreme Commander\nare at the forefront of a new wave\nof PC Gaming, that they\u2019ve made\nit a viable platform again and that\nit shows there\u2019s still innovation in\nthe market. But I think many gamers buy and play these games out of\nco-operation. Out of duty. Like it\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s expected of them.\nMost of them, though, know what\nHell\u2019s March sounds like, they\ncan make the noise an Ion Cannon makes before it immolates a\nHum-Vee, and they believe they\ncan do the Tanya laugh just as they\nremember it. That\u2019s not gamers\nmoving on. That\u2019s not \u201cinnovation\u201d.\nThat\u2019s instinct.\n\n"

    "content": "I\u2019ve got you under my skin\nIf you were paying attention to the\nscience news over the holidays, you\nmay have noticed Human Genetics recently published a report of a\nnew type of human twin, mid-way\nbetween fraternal and identical\ntwins.\nRather unexpectedly, these twins\nresulted not from IVF treatment,\nbut from a natural conception \u2013 the\nonly reason this case came to light\nwas because although one of the\ntwins was an apparently normal\nmale, the other had ambiguous gen-italia. When the latter twin was examined further, it turned out it was\nwhat\u2019s known as a true hermaphrodite \u2013 it had ovotestes, gonads containing both testicular and ovarian\ntissue. This is unusual enough that\nthe researchers also performed\nDNA analysis on both twins, and\ndiscovered they are both chim\u00e6ras\n\u2013 they contain more than two sets\nof genetic material. In layman\u2019s\nterms, each twin contains a bit of\nDouble trouble - twins in the news\nFelix brings you a brief overview of recent research involving human, marmoset and antelope twins\nthe other twin, making the question\nof who\u2019s who rather tricky.\nUsually, humans contain two sets\nof genetic material (or alleles), a\nset from the mother in the egg, and\na set from the father in the sperm.\nFraternal twins are the result of\ntwo eggs being fertilised by two\nsperm cells. As the set of alleles in\none egg or sperm differs from that\nin the other (only half the alleles are\nexpected to be shared), the two sets\nin each twin are different, meaning\nfraternal twins are as genetically\nalike as normal siblings; the only\ndifference being they just happen\nto be born at the same time.\nIdentical twins, by contrast, are\ngenetically identical, as they result\nfrom one egg and one sperm, which\nhas split into two later, so both twins\nare composed of the same two sets.\nThese twins are chim\u00e6ric because\nthough they share alleles from the\nmother\u2019s side (indicating they came\nfrom one egg, like identical twins),\nthey each contain cells originating\nfrom two different sperm, and so\nhave only half their alleles from the\nfather in common (like fraternal\ntwins). Meaning each twin is made\nup of three sets of genetic material\nin total, making them chim\u00e6ras.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether these twins\nare the result of an egg splitting before each half was fertilised by two\nsperm; or, less likely, because the\negg was fertilised simultaneously\nby two sperm, but in either case the\nsubsequent pair of fertilised eggs\nintermixed before becoming two\ndistinct individuals. Resulting in\nthis previously undiscovered type\nof human twin, who are more similar than fraternal twins, but less so\nthan identical twins, and presumably extremely rare.\nMy brother\u2019s keeper\nIn marmosets however, chim\u00e6ric\ntwins are very common; indeed a\nreport published in PNAS a couple of weeks ago, looking at Wied\u2019s\nblack tufted-ear marmosets (which\ntypically produce twins), discovered 72% of the twin litters contained chim\u00e6ras. To be precise,\nthis means at least one twin contained chim\u00e6ric tissue. The reason\nthis is so common in marmosets is\nbecause of the way the twins develop in the uterus \u2013 from an early\nstage their placentas fuse, allowing\nstem cells (and hence alleles) from\none twin to enter into the other\n(and vice-versa, in just under half\nthe cases observed). One important\nconsequence of this is that the stem\ncells which then go on to create one\ntwin\u2019s reproductive system could\ncome from the other twin. So a female marmoset, when breeding,\ncould be providing not her own geneticmaterialbuthertwinbrother\u2019s\nfor example \u2013 and so might be able\nto pass on a Y chromosone, a role\nusually restricted to males. Where\nthis study got even more intriguing\nwas in its examination of the behavioural effect of this \u201chorizontal\u201d dissemination of genes, from one twin\nto the other\u2019s offspring. It turns\nout that marmosets are highly so-cial, with many group members\nproviding care for the infants. The\nresearchers monitored the behaviour of small groups within a colony\nof marmosets at the University of\nNebraska; groups comprising only\nparents and offspring, where only\none twin was chim\u00e6ric, and had\nchim\u00e6ric skin tissue \u2013 the type of\ntissue most likely to show some indication of lineage to the parents.\nBy counting how often each parent\npicked up the chim\u00e6ric and nonchim\u00e6ric twin during their first two\nweeks of life, the researchers were\nable to determine that the males\ncarried chim\u00e6ric offspring significantly more than non-chim\u00e6ric,\nthe trend being reversed for the\nmother.\nOne possibility the authors advance to explain the father\u2019s preference is that the chim\u00e6ric offspring might be more recognizable\nas his offspring (as it might match\nmore of his genes involved in creating individual traits), thus reducing the risk he\u2019s been cuckolded\nand is looking after another marmoset\u2019s offspring. They also note\nthe horizontal sharing might also\nexplain the greater investment in\nthe young by apparently unrelated\ngroup members (when the groups\nare of a normal size) \u2013 if one twin\nmight be the genetic father of the\nother\u2019s offspring, it creates an evolutionary imperative to support his\ntwin\u2019s offspring, to propagate those\ngenes. This would naturally create\na more cohesive group.\nSibling rivalry\nBut though marmosets seem to\nfind having a twin rather useful, it\u2019s\nnot necessarily advantageous for\nall species. Last month also saw\nthe publication of a study into saiga\nantelope, a critically endangered\nspecies which lives on the Eurasian\nsteppe, and which frequently gives\nbirth to twins. A team headed by\nImperial scientist Aline K\u00fchl has\ncooperated with Kazakh rangers to\nmonitor saiga herds each May over\nthree years, weighing calves born\nin the week-long birth season. They\ndiscovered that when the mother\nis pregnant with mixed-sex twins,\nthe male f\u0153tus undergoes much\nless growth than he would if he had\na twin brother instead, and so is\nsignificantly underweight at birth.\nIt\u2019s not clear why the male twins in\nsaiga are disadvantaged \u2013 in cows\nfor example, it\u2019s usually the female\ntwins in mixed-sex litters who suf-fer. However, the researchers expect that underweight male twins\nwill be at a distinct reproductive\ndisadvantage \u2013 at breeding time\nthere is stiff competition with other\nmales, and so being lighter is likely\nto be highly detrimental to reproductive fitness. Future studies will\nverify this, looking at the long-term\neffect of sibling sex on reproductive\nsuccess.\n[Many thanks to Barbara Portella, for structure and content ideas]\nTop: Marmoset \u2013 can sire their twin\u2019s children, as they\u2019re chim\u00e6ras\nBottom: Saiga \u2013 an endangered antelope found in Kazakhstan\nClassics.

It appears that this\nyear\u2019s conference was somewhat\nrevolutionary.\nIn previous years, NUS Conference has been somewhat of a farce,\nbeing hampered by the efforts of the\nfringe left factions to push through\nmotions that call for, for example,\nsolidarity with striking workers in\nother countries, and other such\nthings that are of little relevance to\nstudents of the member unions.\nThis year, however, things had\nchanged. Imperial, newly joined,\nfound itself labelled as the \u201cextreme right\u201d along with other\ndelegations from Sheffield, Kings\nCollege, and Bristol by the leftist\nfactions present at Conference. Respect in particular referred to our\nown card-carrying Labour Party\nmember, Alex Guite, as a \u201crightwing insurgent\u201d. At times, the Conference descended into \u201cRespect\nvs the rest\u201d. Conference old hands\nattributed this to a general distate\nfor Respect\u2019s methods of stalling\nand amendments to motions, and\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\npage 4\npage\nHot dog, jumping\nfrog,Alberquerque\nWondering what this is all about? See inside page for details.\nMost productive NUS conference sees Respect confronting\n\u201cright-wing unions\u201d and realism triumphing over idealism\na desire for change within the NUS\nas a whole.\nDivision was not the whole story\nof the Conference. Many motions\nwere passed unopposed, showing some level of common ground\nbetween the two warring factions;\na resolution calling for overseas\nmedical students to be allowed to\ncomplete their training was passed,\nfor example.\nOther notable defeats for the far\nleft included a failure to pass any\nmotions calling for a costly and\nprobably ineffective national demonstration every year; instead,\nthe NUS is calling for a smarter\napproach to fees campaigning, accepting that some level of top-up\nfees will be a reality for the foreseeable future. ICU delegate Edmund\nHunt gave a speech explaining the\nneed for intelligent lobbying on the\nsubject, arguing that students must\nexplain to the Government why our\neducation is valuable.\nThe cost of affiliating to the NUS\nwill rise to \u00a335,000 in the next few\nyears, and so it is vital ICU gets\nvalue for money from the organisa-tion. Many pro-NUS campaigners\nargued that ICU would be able to\nreform the NUS from the inside;\nindeed a paper was passed calling\nfor a full governance review of the\nunion.

At this point Alex and\nDave stripped to their swim trunks\nand took a plunge while the rest\nof us laughed heartily at how cold\nthey were. By 3pm Saturday we\nhad survived the long journey from\nLondon and more importantly the\nterrifying 7 mile track to the Bothy\nthat lead to some stiff competition\nbetween drivers for the rest of the\nweek (13min10sec, rain and Meatloaf\u2026 most definitely the winner!).\nThat night the boys built a fire on\nthe beach, I prepared dinner, ale/\nwhisky was consumed and everyone was generally satisfied and\nready for the week ahead.\nOn Sunday we explored the hills\nand coastline around the Bothy\nwhile Nathaniel, Nick and Dave\nheaded back to Inverness to pick up\nKathrin. Meanwhile those of us left\nin the hills watched the biologists,\nJoanna and Judith, get excited\nabout various lichen, moss and frog\nporn!\nMonday we were graced with no\nrain and sunshine (as we were for\nmost of the week) \u2013 according to\nChris this was due entirely to my\nearly morning sun dances! With\ngood weather we couldn\u2019t miss the\nopportunity to take on An Teallach\nthe best ridge in Wester Ross.\nAn Teallach lived up to expectations and we all faced the Scrambling challenge to stand on Sail\nLiath (954m) and Bidean a\u2019 Ghlas\nThuill (1062m) with Alex, Dave,\nNathaniel and Richard adding on\nthe more serious ridge to climb\nSgurr Fiona (1060m). As it turns\nout those of us that skirted around\nSgurr Fiona had a worse deal and\nwould have been better off scrambling across the top.\nOn Tuesday we tackled Sgurr Mor\nin the Fanniachs, the tallest mountain in Wester Ross, with much\nthe same fervour. Alex led the first\npart of the route straight up (liter-ally) Meall a\u2019 Charasgaidh (934m)\nour toughest scramble of the week\nand first Munro of the day. We\nthen traced the ridge to Sgurr Mor\n(1110m), Mairead surging ahead for\nthe girls, and along to Beinn Liath\nMhor (954m) where the group split;\nsix of us climbing to the summit and\nsix heading straight to the bus. During this hike the more \u2018responsible\u2019\nmembers of the group determined\nthe quickest way off the mountain\nwas to slide the snow fields!\nOf course sliding on the rear is\nnot quite so extreme and the sport\nwas soon up-graded to sliding head\nfirst, lying on (dare I say it) survival\nbags. At this point I have to add that\nI hold the record for the most spectacular way to stop \u2013 imagine hurtling uncontrollably down a snow\nslide backwards, shooting onto the\ngrass, falling backwards legs flying\noverhead and stopping with your\nface to the ground\u2026according to\nthe others \u2018My God you stopped\nwith your teeth!!\u2019 \u2013 Thankfully noone caught this on camera!\nBy Wednesday we needed an excuse to take a day off from scrambling and what better way than\nwhisky. Becoming tourists we drove\nout to the Glenmorangie distillery for a tour and some sampling.\nThe unfortunate thing about being\nin the company of Fellwanderers\nand good whisky is that you usually spend too much money and I\nbelieve most of the group bought\nsomething away with them \u2013 if only\ndrunkenness (Nathaniel)!\nThatnightIhadeveryonedressup\nin kilts, sporrans and Sgain Dudhs\n(created from towels/survival bags,\nhats and various kitchen utensils),\nwe read out Burns\u2019 \u2018Address to A\nHaggis\u2019 and shared a traditional\nScots meal of Haggis, Neeps and\nTatties. I even had everyone up for\na wee Ceilidh\u2026 fantastic!\nThursday morning Richard left\nus to head South while the remaining eleven hikers headed on to Ben\nWyvis (1046m) the most Easterly\nMunro of Wester Ross. This walk\nshould have been the easiest of the\nweek, but thankfully it was made\nmore challenging by thick cloud\nand freezing wind. It kept us on\nour toes, allowed for some proper\ncompass navigation and meant we\nalmost lost a few people due to poor\nvisibility.\nOnce down we headed to a truckers caf\u00e9 to warm up and provoke\na few of the locals (Coming out of\nthe Caf\u00e9 we quickly removed the\nword \u2018Poofs\u2019 from the back of the\nmini-bus, but we did leave \u2018English\u2019\nfor our memory). We then dropped\nNick off at Garve Station for his epic\njourney south, leaving ten.\nExcitement filled the Geologist\nChris on Friday as he had us drive\nnorth of Ullapool to look at some\n\u2018sexy\u2019 ancient rocks (his words not\nmine)! Four of the boys took the\nhigh road, but due to cloud cover\nand lack of views the five girls and\nHauke opted for the lower route\naround a spectacular loch. Hauke\nadded some spice to our journey\nleaving his camera half way round\nthe loch and while he retrieved it\nwe girls discovered the pure genius\nof power napping (for 1hour).\nSaturday we were graced with Tshirt weather and for our last hike\nwe added another two Munros to\nthe total, Sgurr Breac (999m) and\nA\u2019Chailleach (997m). It was on\nthe way down that I experienced\nmy spectacular \u2018teeth stopping\u2019\nmoment.\nIf this wasn\u2019t enough I was then\nthrown in a loch as a Thank-you for\norganising such a successful trip in\nthe best location in the UK.

Nick Adams and Ali\nAhmed were our most economical\nbowlers, though Ved Vyas was unlucky in his efforts.\nUnfortunate not to qualify into the\nknock-out section, Imperial A continued on in the Wooden Spoon section\nof the competition, a series of two\nshortened matches in which the winner would be determined not by the\nnumber of runs they scored but on\nthe number of boundaries. We had a\nclose match with Bangkok University, but their local knowledge saw\nthem clinch it in the last over. Our final game was against a junior Indian\nCricket Academy, who were unable\nto handle the guile of Ved, Leon and\nJibran as they failed to hit a single\nboundary in their innings.\nIn the meantime, Imperial B were\nenjoying more success as they got\noff to a flying start despite the shaky\nstart courtesy of Abeetha Perera.\nUpon seeing a spinner take the ball\nfor the opening over, Abeetha gleefully insisted on taking strike, only to\nbe dismissed first ball! Al and Shiraz\nled the batting recovery while some\nexcellent fielding work led Imperial\nB to a convincing victory. Imperial B\ncontinued to show great fighting spirit as they battled the Indian Indoor,\nBahrain B and Sri Lankan Air Force\nteams to win a well earned spot in the\nnext round.\nOver the course of the tournament\nAbeetha showed great skill behind\nthe wickets and made up for his early\nmisdemeanour with an unbeaten 31\namongst other good performances\nwith the bat. Shiraz Sabah showed\nthe greatest resilience as he had the\ntesting task of bowling the last over\nin every game. As usual Almaher\nwas proficient with the bat and his\ntidy bowling was well supported with\nsuperb performances from Omair\nTaraq and Anand Subramanian.\nA loss to Maldives led to Imperial\nB missing out on a spot in the cup\ncompetition, however, they did make\nit to the quarter finals of the plate\ncompetition where they would face\nChittagong \u2013 a team of former Bangladesh players managed by Al\u2019s dad!\nThe match was fiercely contested\nhowever Chittagong came out on top\nas their wealth of experience proved\na little too much to handle for a very\nexhausted Imperial B. This was the\nend of the tournament for Imperial\nwho were unfortunate to leave without any silverware; the lads deserved\nbetter.\nIC student Christian Morsbach, a member of IC Gliding club, takes his first solo flight after having been sent solo by Shaun Murdoch.\nHe took up Gliding because he always wanted to fly and the Gliding Club offered an affordable way to learn! Christian is probably the\nonly German glider pilot who had to go to the UK to find out that gliding in Germany is huge. Christian took three excellent solo flights,\nincluding one where he soared with the birds. ICGC is active all year round, including the Summer, and can provide continuous flying\ntraining every weekend (with the same instructors), there\u2019s no cheaper or faster way to learn to fly on your own. For more info, or to\njoin, contact shaun.murdoch02@imperial.ac.uk. Here\u2019s to more first solos soon!\nRiding club gallop to, er, second and fourth\nTrisna Tungadi\nLast month busy for IC horse riders with two teams, A and B, competing in the BUSA Equestrian\nLeague. BUSA opperate somewhat\ndifferent rules compared to normal\nshow jumping and dressage com-petitions. The main difference being that; at each competition, we\nhave to ride a completely strange\nhorse that we have never ridden be-fore, with only around 5-7 minutes\nwarm up in which to get to know\nour horse before a dressage test\nor show jumping course. The aim\nbeing to see who can get the best\nout of their horse in a short period\nof time. Each horse has their own\npersonality, it is the rider\u2019s job to\nquickly recognise how a particular\nhorse likes to be ridden.\nThis year, we had a good start of\nthe competition season; the A team\nwere placed 2nd in our home competition in Trent Park, with Naomi\nacheiving 5th in individual rank-ings. Sadly we were not so lucky\nin the next few away competitions\nthough we did get some good individual placings from Trisna and\nNaomi.\nThe championship league was\nwon by UCL with our A team finishing 4th. Our B team was more successful this year, with Olivia as team\ncaptain, finishing 2nd in the trophy\nleague. In their home competition,\nour chair and B team member,\nKat Grey, was fifth and Sam eighth\nindividually.\nGenerally this year\u2019s competing\nseason had been an enjoyable time\nfor all of us. With a few unexpected\nevents, such as snow in one of our\naway competitions, resulting in the\npostponement of the competition\nand a shortage of qualified horses\nin another competition, where the\nsolution was to use a huge, black,\nyet lovely cob, who had just started\nto learn how to jump. Both of our\nOh my god it\u2019s Black Beauty! - I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know anything else about horses\nhome competitions, hosted at Trent\nPark Equestrian Centre, went rather smoothly this year. Though there\nwere some exciting moments when\nour usually placid jumping horses\ndecided to be play up during the\nwarm up, scaring our rival teams.\nThanks to all the riding club\nmembers and committee this year\nwho have been a huge help in running the competitions, also thanks\nto both of our team captains, Olivia\nand Trisna.\nCricket continued\n\n"

After they\u2019d finished their\nlast match we all went back to the\nhotel to be greeted again by Ved\u2019s\nmum who bought more food for our\nenjoyment. In the evening we took\ntaxis to the Bangkok Night Bazaar,\na market and entertainment venue.\nThe taxis in Bangkok started their\nmeter at about 50p and took you a\nfew miles for no more than another\n50p. The friendly drivers also engaged in exciting conversation and\nwill often advise you the best the\nplace for a \u201cmassage\u201d. Walking the\nstreets of Bangkok proved a challenging task for the squad as we\nwere frequently mobbed by young\nladies offering various massage\ntreatments. Somehow, everything\nin Bangkok costs 200 Baht. We had\na few drinks and a wander round\nbefore heading back via a bar which\nwas a little more innocent than\nthe others. My sleep that night: 7\nhours.\nFriday saw both teams have a\nbreak from cricket so we saw some\nsights in and around Bangkok. Our\nprivate tour bus took us first to one\nof the large temples, which was fairly quiet and free from tourists in the\nearly morning. 90% of Thai people\nare practising Buddhists, and I was\nfascinated to discover a good proportion of men become monks for a\nshort while after turning 20. There\nwere some orange clad monks worshipping in front of a giant statue of\nBhudda with a string attached to it\nbeing held by the monks. We then\nvisited a park outside of Bangkok to\nhave a picnic lunch, again courtesy\nof Ved\u2019s family. On our way back we\nvisited an elephant and crocodile\npark, treating us to a show portraying how the elephant fit into Thailand\u2019s culture and history. We were\nalso treated to elephants playing\nfooty; aside from their lack of pace\nand \u201cpooping\u201d all over the pitch,\nthey actually weren\u2019t half bad.\nThat night we hit the town and visited one of the more upmarket Thai\nclubs. This was a humongous, mul-ti-room electronic extravaganza.\nPeople were friendly, drinks were\ncheap and more importantly there\nwere plenty of women! We partied\nhard until closing at 2am then headed to a \u2018spicy\u2019 after-party in one of\nthe city\u2019s after hours clubs. True to\nits name this was one of the spiciest\nparties we\u2019d ever been to and was\nmuch enjoyed until 5am by the remaining clubbers, myself included.\nLuckily the next morning Imperial\nA didn\u2019t need to get up early. My\nsleep that night: 5 hours.\nOn Saturday Imperial B went off\nto play their next round of matches\nwhile I slept. Ammar and Leon took\na day trip out to see a ruined city\nand temple. I spent the afternoon\nin the hotel enjoying the delights\nof the pool and the relaxing heat. A\nlot of the guys had suits tailored for\nthem in Bangkok and some of them\nwent off to collect them in the after-noon. In the evening we headed out\nfor the RBSC Tournament Dinner,\nto which we arrived very fashionably late, but were received well owing to our impeccable attire! Later\nthat night Imperial B went clubbing\nwhile others, me included, went\nhome to catch up on sleep. My sleep\nthat night: 7 hours.\nSunday was our penultimate day\nand granted us another chance to\nenjoy the city centre. Some of us\nwent out to a large mall with Ved\nto pick up some local merchandise,\nwhile others remained at home.\nThe trip gave us another chance to\nride the SkyTrain, which again impressed me with its efficiency and\ncleanliness. That evening we all\ntook a trip to the Sky Hotel, the tallest building in Bangkok at 88 floors\nhigh. A speedy lift took us right up to\nthe 77th floor observation deck were\nwe enjoyed panoramic views of the\ncity as though we were airborne.\nAfterwards we went back to the\nhotel to enjoy some incredible food\non the 22nd floor Indian restaurant,\nreputed to be the best in Thailand.\nWe ate and drank at leisure, enjoying fine Bollywood music, to which\nwe were treated live. After leaving\nwholly satisfied, we headed out to\nthe club again to enjoy a final night\nin Bangkok. Most of us were tired\nhowever, and we didn\u2019t stay out later than closing time. My sleep that\nnight: 4 hours.\nMonday was our final day and\nthose of us with stamina got up at\n7am to go to the famous floating\nmarket. The road journey was long\nbut took us out of Bangkok and into\nmore rural Thailand, which sported a higher degree of poverty and\nsome subsistence farming. After an\nhour tour, we headed back through\nmorning traffic to pack up and prepare to leave. In the afternoon a few\nof the crew did some last minute\nshopping and after a slightly unnecessarily stressful minibus journey\nto the airport we departed the land\nof smiles back to our own, quite different world. A world of exams and\ndeadlines and a rush to complete\nwork.\nIt was an unforgettable experi-ence, in particular the hospitality\nadorned on us by Ved and his fami-ly, which gave the tour a unique and\nspecial air. I\u2019ll miss Thailand and\nhope to explore its unique culture\nin more depth in the not too distant\nfuture.\n\n"

The gruelling 26.2\nmile course stretched from Greenwich to The Mall, taking\nin some of London\u02bcs most famous sights and landmarks\nalong the way. Thousands of lively spectators \ufb01lled\nthe streets to support the competitors and cheer them\nalong to the \ufb01nish line. Amongst them were members\nof Imperial sta\ufb00 and students along with some of Ben\u02bcs\nfamily and friends.\nThe \ufb01nal few miles of the course took Ben past the Tower\nof London, along the River Thames and past Nelson\u02bcs\nColumn. The end was well and truly in sight as our runner\npassed under the shadow of his namesake \u02bbBig Ben\u02bc, into\nBirdcage Walk and \ufb01nally, along The Mall.\nSweltering heat made this year\u02bcs London Marathon an even\ngreater test of endurance. Temperatures had soared to\naround 21 degrees by midday, making it the hottest event\nsince 1996. Despite the punishing conditions however,\nBen managed to clock an extraordinary \ufb01nishing time of 2\nhours 53 minutes. Speaking at the \ufb01nisher\u02bcs enclosure in\nSt James\u02bc Park he said: \u201cThis has been both a challenging\nand rewarding exercise for me.

    "content": "looming? Let us help you stay alive\nO\nne of the main things\nthat can affect how\nwell we concentrate is\nour diet and the kinds\nof foods we eat. It is\nvery easy to snack on sugary foods\nand drinks to make us feel better\nduring times of revision, but this\ncan actually have a negative effect\non our ability to take in information.\nSo we\u2019ve put together a list of ten\nfoods and drinks that will help your\nmind, as well as body.\nEat for success: our guide to work-friendly food\n1. Porridge\nStart your day the right way with a\nbowl of porridge. Oats have a high\ncontent of complex carbohydrates\nand fibre which encourage slow\ndigestion and stable blood-glucose\nlevels, so you will have a steady\nstream of energy throughout the\nmorning.\nOats are also high in beta-glucan,\nwhich has been linked to the prevention of heart disease.\nDelicious porridge, yesterday.\nfoods, meaning you can stay concentrating for longer. Xylitol is\navailable from supermarkets and\nhealth food stores under the brand\nname Perfect Sweet.\n5. Wholegrains\nA small change, like changing from\nwhite to brown bread, can have a\nsurprising effect on our concentration levels. The carbohydrates\nin refined and processed foods are\nquickly released into the body and\nso make us feel great, but only in the\nshort term, after which our mood\ndrops. The complex carbohydrates\nfound in natural and unprocessed\nfoods work like time release capsules and so keep the brain fueled\nfor longer. However you should still\nlimit yourself to 3 fist sized servings\nof complex cabs a day as too much\ncarbohydrates (even from whole-grains) can upset sugar balance\nand effect mood and energy levels.\n6. Drink plenty of water\nIt is important to keep hydrated as\nthe whole body, but especially the\nbrain, needs plenty of water\nto function correctly. Long\nhours of study can mean\nwe turn to coffee and\ntea to keep us awake,\nbut these should be\nkept to a minimum\nas they upset blood\nsugar levels, dehydrate the body and\nreduce absorption of nutrients from\nfoods. A can of coke contains\nabout 8 teaspoons of sugar,\nwhich is 4 times more than\nshould be in the blood at any\none time. This will result in\nmassive sugar slump and\nloss of concentration when\ninsulin takes the sugar out\nof the blood.\n7. Dried fruit and nuts\nThese are great to snack\non in place of chocolates\nand sweets. Packed full of\nvitamins, minerals and energy\nrespectively they will help keep\nyou working. However don\u2019t over\nindulge as too much dried fruit will\nlead to the sugar hit that you would\nget from chocolate; a small handful\nnow and then is recommended, not\na whole bag!\n8. Fresh fruit\nFresh fruit is packed with vitamins\nand anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants\nhelp combat oxygen\nfreeradicals\u2013chemicals produced\nby the body that\ncan cause damage to nerves\nand the brain!\nAvocados are\na particularly\ngreat fruit to\neat as they are\nthought to increase\nblood flow to the brain and thus\nhelp it function better.\n9. Protein rich foods e.g. fish\nCertain foods are also rich in amino\nacids which are important to neurotransmitters - chemicals crucial\nto the passage of nerve impulses in\nthe brain. Many protein-rich foods\nsuch as fish contain the amino acid\ntryptophan, which plays a key role\nin the manufacture of serotonin,\nwhich affects mood and alertness.\nDopamine levels are also increased\n- the brain chemical responsible for\nthe feeling of alertness. The brain\nalso requires substantial amounts\nof fatty acids, such as Omega-3,\nfound in oily fish, which are used to\nmaintain the health of brain cells.\nThey enhance the receptors of serotonin which makes the brain better able to receive the message to\nfeel good, relax and be calm.\n10. Seeds\nSeeds such as pumpkin, sunflower,\nsesame and linseeds are all good\nsources of protein, essential fatty\nacids and zinc. Zinc is thought to\nbe particularly important to brain\nhealth and plays a significant role\nin activating certain areas of the\nbrain.\n2. Free range eggs\nThese are an excellent source of\nprotein which we need for energy,\ngrowth and to produce essential en-zymes. Poached or boiled eggs are\na healthier choice than fried eggs,\nbecause you don\u2019t need to add fat\nduring cooking.\nAlways try and go for organic free\nrange eggs as they are higher in\nessential fatty acids (EFAs), which\nhave been linked to good brain\nhealth. Columbus Omega 3 eggs\nare one of the best buys as they are\nfrom birds specifically fed on a high\nOmega 3 diet.\n3. Natural yoghurt\nThis contains active and living bacterial cultures which help to boost\nthe immune system. It is especially\nimportant to look after your immune system during revision and\nexams as stress can make you more\nvulnerable to illnesses. By helping\nto maintain the balance of bacteria\nin your bowel and prevent\nthe overgrowth of candida yeast you will also\nbe helping your mind, as\ntoo much of this yeast has\nbeen linked to emotional\nsymptoms and poor mental state.\n4. Use xylitol in place of\nsugar\nXylitol is a 100% natural\nsubstance found in fruits\nand plants, which has far\nfewer calories and carbohydrates than sugar,\nand releases its energy\nmuch slower (it has\na GI value of just 7,\nabout ten times lower\nthan sugar). A slow\nrelease of energy\nmeans you will have\nmore constant blood\nsugar levels, which stops\nthe peaks and troughs of\nmood and energy that\nyou get with high sugar\nA lighter side: toilet grafitti at its worst\nToilet grafitti in the library around exam time tends to reveal some startling\ntruths about students under stress. Alongside nerdy jokes (normally\npainstakingly drawn), we have pithy little truths like the one above.\nI\u2019m sure this is all very clever, but we honestly don\u2019t\nunderstand this one. I guess we do the wrong subjects.\nWe couldn\u2019t possibly comment. Ah, redundancy. Good one.\nThese are taken from the toilets in the library. Add your grafitti there.\n7\nfelix\nFriday 27 April 2007\nEXAMS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
