The association process has\nbeen marred by UK-EU disagreements\nover the Northern Ireland Protocol\nincluded in the Brexit deal, which\nprotects the Good Friday agreement and\nhas led to a de facto border in the Irish\nsea, segregating Northern Ireland from\nthe rest of the UK. It is understood by\nmany that UK association to Horizon\nEuropeisbeingpostponeduntilafterthe\nNorthern Ireland issue has been settled.\nBefore Brexit, the UK was the\nsecond largest beneficiary of EU\nR&D funding, trailing only behind\nGermany. The UK government\u2019s post-Brexit Innovation Strategy has been\ndesigned to \u201cdrive forward ambitions as\na science superpower\u201d, according to the\nUK government website. Aside from\nHorizon Europe, the department for\nBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy\nhas set out a three year plan to increase\nR&D spending to \u00a339.8 billion for the\nperiod 2022 - 2025. This will reportedly\ninvolve a \u00a35 billion per annum increase\nin government investment, so that total\nyearlyinvestmentby2025willequal\u00a320\nbillion.

This\namountedtoaround10%oftotalresearch\nfunding awarded during this period.\nMany scientists have voiced far more\nconcern over the prospect of losing the\nability to collaborate with scientists\nacross Europe as a result of the UK\u2019s\nmembershiptoHorizonEuropenotbeing\nratified, rather than the loss of funding.\nThe recently published REF 2021\nresults show Imperial College as the\ninstitution most consistently producing\n\u201cworld-leading\u201d research in the UK,\nan accolade that will undoubtedly\nattract more research funding from\nHorizon Europe and other sources alike.\nThe ICU feedback board trial has\nlaunched in three departments at\nImperial College and will run until the\nlastweekofJune.Theprojectisdesigned\nand facilitated by myself, Union Deputy\nPresident (Education) Daniel Lo, with\nthe objective of improving the Union\u2019s\nsupport for both academic and wellbeing student representatives (reps).\nThe feedback board was designed\nto help reps collect student feedback\non a centralised platform to effectively\nclose the \u201cfeedback loop\u201d. In addition,\nthe board helps departmental staff\nand reps to make bi-monthly StudentStaff Committees more productive,\nsuch that these meetings can focus on\nhigh-level issues instead of short-term\nqueries that often can be fixed quickly.\nStudents can anonymously post their\nacademic or welfare-related queries on\nthe feedback board, where everyone\nin their cohort can both view, and\ninteract with, the posts. Year reps act as\nmoderatorstogatekeeppostsubmissions\nto ensure the content is appropriate\nand cohort-related and raise feedback\nto the appropriate departmental staff.\nYear reps will also notify students on\nthe same platform once they receive\na response or an update, effectively\nclosing the feedback loop. All feedback\nis automatically collated onto one\nplatform, making the process more\nconvenient for students. Welfare\nsignposting links, departmental staff,\nand rep contact details are also included\nonthesameplatformtoeffectivelydirect\nstudentstotheCollege\u2019sstudentsupport\nservices and increase rep visibility.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe trial, the Union selected three\ndepartments across various faculties and\nlevels of study: BEng/MEng Materials,\nBSc/MSc Physics, and various MRes/\nPhD courses in Chemistry. The decision\nwas also based on a recent rep feedback\nsurvey conducted by the Union, in\nwhich a strong desire to introduce\nan online feedback tool was felt.\nThe feedback board project received\nstrong interest and support from current\nreps and the College, who thought that\ntheboardcouldmakecollectingfeedback\nmore manageable and the results more\naccessible. Vice-Provost (Education and\nStudent Experience) Emma McCoy said\nthat \u201cThe feedback board trial is a really\npositive step towards improving the\nstudent experience.

Reports suggest that an internal student\nsurvey shocked senior leaders by revealing the scale\nof the disaster currently unfolding. According to a\nsource in the Blue Cube, there has been a 400% increase in the number of people attributing their lack\nof mental health to the Department of Physics.\nOne survey respondent, Seb Fenton (3rd year EEE),\nwhose name we have anonymised to protect his\nidentity, told interviewers that \u201cIf I have to listen to\nmy physics flatmate complaining how hard his degree\nis one more time I think I might put him out of the\nmisery\u201d.\nThe final report, seen by NegaFelix, suggests that\nthe major driver of the uptick in mental distress was\n\u201chearing physics students griping all the time\u201d.\nDepartment student groups have met the news with\nrelief. Parna Apillai, the President of the RCSU, told\nNegaFelix that natural science students in particular\nhad been hit hard by the physicists moaning, telling complaining students that \u201cIf all science can be\nreduced to physics, why don\u2019t you go whip up some\npsychology and fix how you feel\u201d.\nUnfortunately, our interview with both the Physics\nDep Rep and the Physics Wellbeing Rep produced\nno meaningful information as both spent the entire\nduration telling us how \u2018[their] degree is so much\nmore complicated than ours\u201d and how \u201cthey could do\nanything we did three times better\u201d preventing us\nfrom representing their perspective.\nFamous recovered physicist, Maria Hegelhorn, who\nnow studies this phenomenon, told NegaFelix reporters that the issue was not simply limited to Imperial.\nIn a paper published last year, Hegelhorn suggests\nthat not going outside enough resulted in the strange\nbehaviours common to those in the field.\nEven Hegelhorn, however, has not totally cured\nherself of the mentality. Found at the bottom of her\npaper in very small font were the words \u201cHahahahaha take that social scientists, I can just come into\nyour field and do what I want\u201d.\n*Allegedly, an earlier draft of the report suggested\nthat students should take responsibility for their own\nmental health as adults and not infantilise themselves\nby treating those in authority as surrogate parental figures but this has been dismissed as ridiculous hearsay.\n\n"

Videos of people (\u2018ASMRtists\u2019 as they\nare now known) whispering or brushing, microphones\nto elicit a relaxing tingling sensation can be found all\nover YouTube and TikTok. Is there aesthetic value or\na deeper meaning behind these videos, or will it fade\naway like other internet fads? Regardless, a new exhibition at the Design Museum explores the weird and the\nwonderful world of ASMR.\nTheexhibitionbeginsbyoutliningthedifferenttypes\nof ASMR experience. Visual ASMR creations from\nOscar Pettersson\u2019s Rotating Rings or Andreas Wannerstedt\u2019s Slice It Up focus on the visual, often hypnotic,\nASMR experience as opposed to an audio-based one\nmost found online. Some ASMR experience are \u201cunintentional\u201d such as in the work of Bob Ross, the television painter whose show The Joy of Painting brought a\nproto-ASMR experience to millions in the early nine-ties.\nExamples of his art line one of the rooms alongside\na film of the artist at work. The art he produces is not\nbeautiful. For the most part it is kitsch and tacky, unworthy of much cognitive interrogation. But through\nthe act of painting, the delicate monotony of mixing\ncolours,dabbinghisbrushesgentlyinthem,andwiping\npaint onto his canvas, he elicits a meditative sensation.\nI found myself in a trance, as if the afro headed American\u2019s dulcet tones were lulling me into a higher state of\nrelaxation. There is an anti-intellectualism here; audience members are not required to think but rather just\nto feel, not in an emotion sense, but in a physical one.\nIt is this shared feeling, knowing that everyone else\nfeels what you are feeling, that is the foundation of the\nASMR to community. The World of ASMR gives serious critical attention to the phenomenon whilst also\nexploring the culture around it. The emphasis on \u201cdigital intimacy\u201d acts as an antidote to digital alienation,\ndoom scrolling, or social media induced anxiety. This\nis the concept at the heart of Marc Teyssier\u2019s Prototype\nfor Artificial Skin for Mobile Devices. The work consists of a silicone coating, evoking the appearance of venous skin, coating a phone: the phenomenological experience of human skin and human experience in clear\ndialogue with the phone\u2019s hard plastic exterior, but also\nthe ethereal digital world it enables. It is reminiscent of\nDavidCronenbergwhosehorrorfilmVideodromesees\na nightmarish fusing of body and technology. Except\nhere the object is mundane, something that could easily find a way into our lived reality.\nNeedless to say, many of the exhibits are interactive.\nJulie Rose Bower\u2019s ASMR studio invites participants\nto create their own ASMR experiences by interacting\nwith a range of objects linked to headphones to induce\na tingling feeling. But the highlight of the exhibition\nare the works that do not just elicit an ASMR experi-ence, but actively question the nature, and interrogate\nthe consequences of said experience.\nTobias Bradford\u2019s that feeling/immeasurable thirst\nhas the aura of a Dada ready-made both in its physical form and its sense of humour. The work consists of\na silicon tongue rendered in spine chilling detail with\ndribbling saliva and taste buds, powered with a small\nhumming motor to simulate movement. It waggles and\nwriggles; placed at eye level it is almost sexual, inviting\nits viewer for a French kiss, mocking us in its ability to\nmimic us. It is comical, but it evokes ideas about Transhumanism and Cyberpunk.\nThe wonderful world of ASMR\nReviewed by Alexander Cohen Arts Editor\nThe World of ASMR\nWhere? The Design Museum\nWhen?

    "content": "Iwould like to begin this article by stating that I am not a therapist, nor am I\na life-coach, or a psychologist. I am simply a student who has struggled with my\nmental health and wellbeing for almost\nmy entire time at Imperial. That said,\nthere are two reasons why I have written\nthis article. My first reason is personal, I\nwanted to reflect on how far I have come\nas a result of my own efforts. My second\nreason is that I simply wanted to share\nsome tips that may help anyone who\nis in a place I was in not so long ago. I\nwould describe that \u2018place\u2019 as a form of\npurgatory \u2013 an almost stagnant position\nin my life. In that position, I knew that I\nhad to make some changes if I wanted to\nreach \u2018the good place\u2019, because the easier option would have me either stuck in\nthe middle or regressing back to \u2018the bad\nplace\u2019. Although by that point in time I\nhad been on antidepressants for almost\na year, received mental health support\nthrough my GP, and received regular\nwellbeing support from my department\u2019s Wellbeing Advisor. I felt I had\ngotten as far as the antidepressants and\nthe external support could get me. The\nFinal Boss, if you will, was me.\nVisualising what I wanted to\ndo using Pinterest\nI specifically chose to start using Pinterest as, I knew that it would be very\ndifficult to convert the time I spent\nscrolling through Instagram or Twitter to zero, so I decided that if I were to\nscroll through content \u2013 I would rather it was content that I carefully curat-ed with a strong intention of inspiring\nmyself. Pinterest allowed me to build\ncollections of images that helped me to\nidentify the areas of my life I wished to\nfocuson.Asintenseasthatmaysound,it\nwas more akin to me creating and developing mood-boards that were essentially multiple Instagram Explore pages in\nthe form of themed \u2018Pin-boards\u2019. At the\nstart of my journey I had no real direc-tion, essentially I did not know what this\n\u2018good place\u2019 would look like, nor what\nI would be doing there. So, by creating\nthese image banks, I gradually was able\nto build a better image of my future self\nin my mind, which inspiredme to try\nnew things. For example, some of my\nfirst Pins were study inspiration images.\nSincethen,Ihavepushedmyselftostudy\nin spaces outside my small bedroom \u2013 a\nsmall change which has yielded amazing\nresults for me when it comes to my studying productivity.\nSetting aside time to enjoy\nmy \u2018off\u2019 moments\nIn a discussion with my Wellbeing\nAdvisor, I was encouraged to use a Pomodoro timer to split up my study time\ninto more manageable and observable\nchunks. So, I started using this timing\ntechnique, and I noticed that each time\nI was supposed to have a short break after 25 minutes of working, I felt a great\ninternal resistance against the break.\nIn fact, I often found myself a bit stuck\nas to what to do with my time \u2018off\u2019. I\nslowly began to realise that I spent so\nmuch of my time when I should not be\nworking, either thinking about work I\nneeded to do, or just not fully focusing\non the present if it was unrelated to my\nacademics. So gradually, I forced myself to do something completely remote\nfrom my studies when I needed a break.\nThis was a very difficult thing for me to\ndo consistently. I already struggled to\nsavour my relaxation time when I was\naround my friends, so I rarely set aside\nadequate time to relax in my own com-pany. Even when I was procrastinating, I\ndid not particularly find myself enjoying\nthat time I spent \u2013 it was often me lying in bed chasing crumbs of dopamine\nthrough Twitter threads. Therefore, I\ndecided to start with simple things, like\nstaying off my phone as I ride on public\ntransport - all I do now is listen to music\nand people-watch as I travel to campus.\nThen I started do things I loved yet always told myself I did not have the time\nfor. For example, reading a book during\nthe term time. I love reading, and so\nwhen I sat down and set aside one hour\nto just read, with no distractions, I felt\na part of myself light up that had been\ndormant for so long. Reading is truly\none of my favourite activities so I am a\nbit biased in saying this, but I cannot\nemphasise enough how rewarding it is to\nswitch off from Imperial life by simply\nreading a good book. In a world full of\ndistractions, sitting in silence and focusing on the words on a page helps to take\nmy mind off things in a way that, say,\nwatching a Netflix show simply cannot.\nWriting and drawing in my\njournal\nAfter my Wellbeing Advisor suggested that writing my thoughts out would\nhelpmedetanglefromtheminmoments\nThree small and simple actions\nthat improved my wellbeing\nAnonymous\nFRIDAY 20TH MAY 2022\n15\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Have an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or piece to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA brief list of helpful yet simple things that I started doing to\nimprove my wellbeing during term time.\nPhoto credits: Charles Deluvio on Unsplash\nCreating moodboards on Pinterest\nPhoto credits: Cottonbro on Pexels\nSavouring the moment with a good book\nPhoto credits: Olya P on Unsplash,\nMarcus Paulo Prado on Unsplash\nJournalling\nWHAT IS \u2018WELLBEING\u2019?\nFinding a single, universal definition for wellbeing is difficult, especially given the diversity of priorities and lifestyles each individual human being has. Instead, there are\ngeneral definitions around what wellbeing means. According to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), \u201cwell-being can be described as judging life positively\nand feeling good\u201d. As brief as this sounds, the CDC continues to state that wellbeing is\nmultidimensional and thus involves a balance of physical, economic, social and emotional well-being (among other aspects).\n\n"

As a jazz\namateur, I wasn\u2019t familiar with big bands\u2019 sounds and\npieces. Led by Chris\nDean, The World\u2019s\nBiggest Band is a unique\nsetup made up of our\nvery own Imperial\nCollege Big Band and\nthe Syd Lawrence\nOrchestra.\nTalking to Chris after\nthe performance, I was\nsurprised to learn that\nthe two bands have only\nrehearsed together three times. The ensemble opened\nwith the fast-paced Benny Goodman\u2019s \u2018Sing, Sing,\nSing\u2019, which I was told is a classic big band piece. I was\nblown away by the power of the first note as it blasted\nonto my eardrums. One aspect of note was that each\nsection was given its own moment to exhibit their\ntalents. Every piece and song had shining moments\nfrom each instrument, like the trumpets in \u2018Two\nO\u2019Clock Jump\u2019 by Harry James and the trombones by\nAdam Thomas (from Birmingham, Alabama) in Pat\nMetheney\u2019s \u2018Dream of the Return\u2019.\nAfter a thirty minute intermission and some\ndrinks (although the bar is open throughout the\nperformance), the second half of the concert was\nunderway. One of my favorite performances was\n\u2018Feeling Good\u2019 by vocalist Elle Soo, whose smoky\ntone paired perfectly with the ambiance of the song. I\nenjoyed it much more than the widely coveted version\nby Michael Bubl\u00e9, but that might just be subjective.\nWe finished on a high with Buddy Rich\u2019s \u2018Love for\nSale\u2019, - I was blown away by the phenomenal drum\ncadenza, played with incredible coordination and\ncontrol.\nI have to commend the university musicians for\nnot only keeping up with the professional orchestra,\nbut also driving the momentum throughout the\nperformance. The only personal qualm I had with the\nconcert was that it perhaps lacked a little keyboard\nattention and the slightly hefty \u00a315 tickets. Despite\nthat, it was genuinely a wonderful introduction to Big\nBand and jazz; I\u2019d recommend their performances to\namateurs and enthusiasts alike.\nMUSIC\nAs countries within Europe (plus rogue Australia)\nline up to fight for the glory of \u2018best song\u2019,\nviewers at home split. Some throw a themed party in\ncelebration; others attempt to ignore the monopoly\non the TV schedule.\nYet in recent years, fan or no, we have all cringed in\nshame as the UK failed again and again to shake their\nlosing streak.\nIn shock over the weekend, having prepared to face\nthe fate of the previous year \u2013 last place \u2013 viewers\nswitched back over to the Eurovision Song Contest as\nSam Ryder rose to the top of the leaderboard.\nCompeting with his song \u2018Space Man\u2019, Sam Ryder\nrose through the ranks to become a Eurovision star as\nwell as a Tik Tok one.\nFirst discovered on Tik Tok during the Covid\nlockdowns, Sam Ryder became the most followed UK\nartist on the platform. This success translated into a\nrecord deal and a sold-out tour of his first album. His\nclassic pop-rock paired with his charisma and \u2018God of\nThunder\u2019 style brought great interest and he was soon\nproposed to be this year\u2019s entrant for the contest.\nIn a stunning turn of events during the final,\nviewers watched as National Jury votes sent the UK\nto first place over the anticipated winners - Ukraine.\nEven the hosts of the show appeared shocked; in the\n2021 final, the UK\u2019s John Newman came last with\nzero points awarded from the juries and the public.\nFor those of you who are yet to experience the\nprocess of revealing votes within the competition,\nthe mocked hour-long process builds anticipation as\nthe ranking of the 25 countries shifts with every set\nof results. The Jury results come first as experts across\nthe nations give their verdict, then the public\u2019s voice is\nadded to fray.\nLeading up to the last minute, Ukraine gained a\nsudden surge of voting from the public to reach a\nwell-deserved 1st place. Despite this, the runner up\nUK delegation looked ecstatic with their 466 points,\nas Space Man had launched them past all the other\ncontestants and into orbit. There is hope for the\nfuture, and now we know that it\u2019s possible to reach\nsuch heights.\nWith sudden success after so many years of losses,\nhas the solution been found in mimicking such a\nperformance again?\nPerhaps, but maybe the secret does not lie in the\ntype of song or the social media fame of the artist\nbut instead in the perception of the nation sending\nour entrants. After all, UK entrants used to do well,\ncommonly coming in the top three spots and even\nwinning on multiple occasions.\nIn the 1990s, record labels stopped putting forward\ntheir stars to represent the UK, thinking that the\ncontest was outdated. It was only then that we sank\nto the bottom of the scoreboard. So, perhaps we\ncreated our own\ndownfall. We\ndecided not to\nsend well-known\nartists and in\nturn our results\nplummeted so\nthat no-one\nwanted to send\nany more stars.\nA poisoned\ncycle of our own\nmaking, resulting in disdain for the competition and\nfear that competing could ruin careers.\nAll it took was a change in perception, attributed\nto a young Italian rock group that toured the world\nfollowing global success at Eurovision. M\u00e5neskin rose\nto fame following their win at the 2021 Eurovision\nContest. They appear to have set the bar for future\nacts and lit a spark in countries who had forgotten the\nimportance and joy of Eurovision.\nSam Ryder may have finally paved the way for the\nUK\u2019s joy and pride in Eurovision to blossom again.\nEurovision cycle of shame finally broken?\nWritten by Niamh Heneghan Music Writer\nAs the UK\u2019s entrant - Sam Ryder - climbed to 2nd place for the first time in 20 years, is it possible that the UK may\nfinally win again?\nNewsic\nPhoto credit: Cindy Liu\n\n"

    "content": "Snake bites are one of the most neglected tropical diseases in the\nworld. There is no economic incentive\nto invest as much in the research of an-tivenoms to cure snake bites because\nmost of them happen in developing\ncountries, where there is less available\nfunding for research, and people are\nless able to afford the antivenoms, so\npharmaceutical companies have not\ngot economic incentives to produce an-tivenoms. But this is an issue as 130,000\npeople die every year due to snake bites.\nA sustainable way to deal with venoms\nshould exist to guarantee that everyone\nwho is bitten by a snake can survive it.\nYou may have heard that you need\nsnake venom to make antivenom, but\nwhy is that? To make an antivenom requires first extracting the venom from\nthe snake. Only a tiny drop is obtained,\nas producing venom is very costly for the\nsnake. Therefore, hundreds of extractions are needed to have enough venom\ntocreateaviabletreatmentagainstsnake-bitess. The venom collected is then in-jectedintolargemammalssuchashorses\nor sheep in non-lethal doses for months.\nThe venom triggers the immune system\nof the animal to form antibodies to neu-tralise them. Once the concentration of\nantibodies is high enough, it\u2019s time to\nextract the animal\u2019s blood. The blood is\nprocessed to purify the antibodies and\nfinally, you have your antivenom ready.\nA snake must be milked several times\nto get decent amounts of venom to make\nantivenom and they take months to produce sufficient antibodies. To obtain a\nvial of antivenom is usually an expensive\nand laborious project. A single vial costs\nover$1500andthepatientusuallyneeds\n20-30 vials to recover completely, so the\nfinal cost is around $30,000 \u2013 45,000.\nIn addition, most of the patients don\u2019t\nknow which snake species bit them,\nwhich forces doctors to inject different\ntypes of antivenom for the most common snakes in that area. The high costs\nof antivenoms dramatically reduce their\navailability in developing countries.\nHowever, these countries have got problems with venomous snakes whereas\ndeveloped countries do have not that\nhigh abundance or diversity of venomous snakes. Australia is the biggest\nexemption, but to be fair, everything\nin Australia can potentially kill you.\nWhat potential solutions are\nthere to this problem? Here, I am\ngoing to discuss two solutions:\none comes from \u2018Snake-Man\u2019, and\nthe other is a universal antivenom.\nBill Haast, a.k.a \u2018Snake-Man\u2019, has been\nbitten 173 times by venomous snakes -a world record. He survived all of them\nbecause he injected venoms daily, in\nnon-lethaldosesfrom32snakespeciesto\nbuildhisnaturalimmunityagainstsnake\nvenom. Another of his accomplishments\nis handling more than 3,000,000 venomous snakes during his lifespan, which\nwas not short - he lived to 101 years\nold! He suspected that his outstanding\ngood health was due to the venom injections and indeed, there is ongoing\nresearch into the potential therapeutic\napplications of snake venom. Bill Haast\nsaved many lives by donating his blood,\nwhich was rich in antibodies against\nsnake venom. Could we inject people\nregularly with snake venom to give them\nimmunity, and allow them to save others from snakebites? There are several\nadvantages to this method compared to\ninjecting horses. First, you solve the distribution mismatch problems by immu-nising the locals, and not all of them require immunisation as their antibodies\ncan be used to immunise others, so it\u2019s\nalso cost-effective. Second, you will not\nneed to maintain as many large mammals and the method would only need\nto be applied where there is a shortage\nof antivenom. Third, as the antibodies\nare extracted from humans and not from\nlarge mammals such as horses, we reduce\nthe risk that the receptor suffers an adverse immunological reaction to the an-tibodies. However, the biggest problem\nwould be convincing the someone to\nvolunteer for daily venom injections, as\nthis is a painful process. It will also take\ntime,butasittargetedandprovenmeth-od, it could be implemented successfully\nin hotspots of snakebite within 4 years.\nAll venomous snakes, from the cobra to the viper, have a common ances-tor: the first venomous snake on Earth,\nwhich then evolved into the venomous\nsnake species we see today. The venom\nfrom this original snake contains proteins that are present in all other snake\nspecies, as their venoms derived from\nthis original venom. Therefore, if we\ntrack which proteins of the venom are\nuniversal, we could develop an antivenom that could work effectively against\nall venomous snakes worldwide, or at\nleast ameliorate the damaging effects\nof different poisons. But right now, we\ndon\u2019t know which proteins are universal,\nand there is another theory which suggests snake venom could have evolved\nindependently in a number of different\nspecies, which would mean they may\nnot all share the same proteins. Snake\nvenom is one of the most complex organic substances with hundreds and\nhundreds of proteins that sometimes are\nvery similar to each other. There is still\nmuch more work to be done in this field.\nSnakes are beautiful creatures, but\ndangerous, especially if they have venom that could potentially kill. Dozens of\nthousands of people die each year in developing countries because there is not\nenough antivenom for everyone. \u2018SnakeMan\u2019 is a marvellous example of how\nsomeone can enhance your immune system system to protect against antiven-oms, and there remains the possibility\nof developing a universal antivenom.\nFRIDAY 20TH MAY 2022\nSCIENCE\n5\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nHow to solve the problem\nof snakebites?\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nSnake-Man injected snake venom daily to make himself immune to it and scientists are researching a\nuniversal antivenom\nSaw-scaled viper, a highly venomous viper found in the dry regions of Africa, the Middle East,\nIndia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan\nPhoto credit: Dfpindia, CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\n"

Bradford\u2019s work is a reminder that our bodies are nothing more than biological machines. Given the right inputs, certain responses\nwill result. As autonomous and free as I feel, my body\nis just responding to its world, to the various stimuli\nit encounters. For some that might be terrifying. For\nothersitisreassuring,somethingundeniablystableand\npredictable in a chaotic world.\nHampsteadTheatreiscosy;itsstageslantingdownwards towards the audience, grey and completely\nempty. The lights go out and darkness descends. Suddenly, the stage is illuminated, and we jump into The\nBreach, a new play by Naomi Wallace.\nThe story follows Jude and the protective love she\nharbours for her younger brother Acton. We witness\nthe effects of the fallout of a foolish, high-stakes game\nof one-upping that Acton plays with his older friends\nHokeandFraynetoconformwiththeothers.Theshadow of a dark and shameful event beginning to emerge;\nan occurrence so dark that I did feel that at times I had\nto suspend my disbelief that these children, in all their\nnaivety, could have gone through with it.\nThe audience are initially spirited back to 1977\nwhere a conflict between patriotism and the growing\nunease at witnessing the effects of a war in Vietnam has\nfiltered unconsciously through to a generation of children growing up. Throughout the play we flit between\nthis time and 1991 when the grown up children reflect\non their past. Here, The Breach manages to capture the\nsurreal contrast between the harshness of reality and\nthe innocence of the children experiencing it, as they\ngrow to be adults and try to come to terms with newfound guilt and discomfort about their pasts.\nTerrible events are juxtaposed with the banal, representing the oblivious way in which the characters experience such things as children. One striking example is\nwhen Jude and Acton play a game where they imagine\ntheir father thinking about Velveeta on rye bread as he\nfalls through the sky to his death in an unconscious effort to cope with the cruel world their minds aren\u2019t big\nenough to internalise.\nThe script is dotted moments of light and darker\nhumour (risqu\u00e9 jokes about sexual consent), as well as\nsporadic solemnity. The younger Jude is brought to life\nthrough Shannon Tarbet\u2019s fiery and touching portrayal\nthat captures the warring emotions of a girl who must\ngrow up too fast, as she sacrifices herself to protect her\nbrother Acton (Stanley Morgan) from harm and struggles to decide how (and whether) to keep the awkward amorous forays of Hoke (Alfie Jones) and Frayne\n(Charlie Beck) at bay.\nThere isn\u2019t much in the way of a set or props, give or\ntake a blanket, an encyclopaedia or two, and Acton\u2019s\nguitar. Such is the way with many modern productions,\nand in this character-focussed play I didn\u2019t mind it too\nmuch. The darkness and minimalism did manage to\ngive a sense of memories being recounted.\nOverall, Wallace does offer us something in The\nBreach, if not through the realism of its plot, then\nthrough the reality of the way it captures the paradox\nof children\u2019s lack of awareness in the grown-up world\nof rape, war, and death happening in the background.\nReviewed by Waleed El-Geresy Arts Writer\nThe Breach\nWhere?

    "content": "Along the north coast of Papua New\nGuinea live the Murik people. The\nMurik were first recorded by the Dutch\nin 1616 and left relatively alone until\ntheir land was colonised and set ablaze\nby the Germans in World War One,\nthen briefly occupied by the Japanese\nin World War Two. 1975 saw the independence of Papua New Guinea, and\nnow the Murik people number up to\n1,500, spread across five main villages.\nThe Murik live primarily through fishing and commerce, trading not only\nsmoked fish, baskets, tobacco and so on,\nbut even non-material goods like basket\ndesigns and dances. They are also among\nthe first to be called climate refugees.\nThe sea level of Papua New Guinea\nhas risen at a rate more than double the\nglobal mean (7mm per year) since 1993,\nas highlighted in COP23. This will only\nworsen in the future, with predicted\ncyclonesandrainfallsofgreaterintensity,\nhigher wind speeds and stronger coastal\nand inland floods. With the predicted\nwarming of 1.1 \u00b0C per year by 2030,\nthe future is not bright for Papua New\nGuinea, as we expect to see its fisheries\nand crops destroyed, dislocating even\nmore people.\nThe story of Papua New Guinea\nfalls in line with a common trend we\nhave been seeing: smaller, marginalised\npopulations in the global South\nsuffering problems not caused by them\nbut by larger economies in the global\nNorth. And though we can observe the\nmaterial consequences of climate change\nin the lives of the Murik, we must also\nconsider how the local societies and\ncultures respond to such changes. Do\nthey see this as the potentially species-ending threat that many of us see it as, or\ndo they have a different understanding\nto ours?\nDavid Lipset, professor of\nAnthropology at the University of\nMinnesota, conducted an ethnography\non the Murik in the wake of severe\ncoastal erosion from high tides in 2007,\nlooking at the various attitudes of the\nMurik on these tides and how they relate\nto the religious beliefs and customs\nof the population. Lipset grounds the\nMurik\u2019s attitudes within the history of\nchanging human agency towards nature.\nWhilst explorers of the past saw nature\nas an \u2018untamed expanse\u2019 upon which\nhumans could assert their mastery\n(Lipset even argues that the adoption\nof GMT in 1884 established mastery\nof time over nature), we are now in a\nsituationwherewecannolongercontrol\nthe effects of our own decisions: our\nmastery supersedes agency.\nAnd so it goes for the Muriks that\nLipset talks to. In the ethnography, he\nnotes two main responses to the tides.\nAmong the politicians and upper-middle-class, the common sentiment\nwas one of weakness: the tides are a\nsignificant act of nature, and any local\nefforts will be ineffective, denying\nagency on their part. Meanwhile,\nthe more local villagers, though still\nexpressing uncertainty and fear, saw\nthe tides as not without precedent and\nproposedmagicalsolutions.Amanfrom\nthe Wewak town said that these tides, as\nwell as the tides of the past, were events\nwith symbolic and ritualistic meaning,\nrepresenting a pact with their ancestors.\nWith a gift of food thrown into the\nocean and an erected platform for each\nprior lineage, the water spirits would\nrestore the beaches to their prior beauty.\nIt is likely no surprise which attitude\nSir Michael Somare (Prime Minister\nof Papua New Guinea) adopted when\nspeaking to the UN about reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions. In requesting\nthe world\u2019s nations to cooperate, Somare\ntacitly accepted the lack of Papua New\nGuinea\u2019s local agency in tackling its\nproblems with climate change. This\nshows a shift in how our society interacts\nwith its environment: changes to the\nenvironment can only be achieved on\n\u2018distant, globalised terms\u2019.\nIt would be easy to dismiss the people\nof Wewak as they throw food into the\nocean in hopes of a magically restored\nbeach. Lipset states \u2018Because global\nrisks are understood as incalculable,\nunlimited, and unaccountable, and their\nlocation in space and time is global,\nrather than territorial, \u2026 local agency \u2026\nbecome[s] problematic.\u2019. In that case, can\nwe even say there is a more reasonable\nway to respond to this problem where\nthere cannot be local agency? Are we\nperforming as much of a ritual as the\nMuriks when we pick up litter or pick\nthe train over the car? Can we really\nblame them?\nClimate refugees and the loss of agency\neffects on sea life. Increased acidity also\namplifies the impact of global warming,\nan example being the bleaching of coral.\nAcidic waters weaken coral growth,\nmaking it even more difficult to resist\nand survive the bleaching caused by\nincreasing temperatures. Other manmade compounds (such as nitrates,\nphosphates, and sulphur dioxide) can\nalso contribute to this acidification.\nOcean acidification can be measured\nby aragonite saturation (a measure of\ncarbonate ion concentration); decreased\nsaturation damages and destroys\naragonite-based structures such as shells\nand coral. Pre-industrial aragonite\nsaturation was 3.44, while the current\nvalue is ~2.9, and the safe operating\nboundary is 2.75.\n7. Atmospheric Aerosol Loading \u2013 not\nfully quantified\nAtmospheric aerosols are microscopic\nparticulates that escape from Earth\u2019s\nsurface into its atmosphere. These can\ncreate both air and water pollution and\naffect the water and weather cycles,\ninfluencing climate change, biodiversity,\nand global warming. Aerosols are\ngenerally defined as PM2.5 (less than\n2.5 \u03bcm in diameter). Primary aerosols\nsuch as soot and sea salt are picked up\nnaturally from the Earth\u2019s surface. In\ncontrast, secondary aerosols are formed\nby physical or chemical reactions,\ncreating particles such as organic\ncompounds, greenhouse gases, or acidic\nliquid droplets. Atmospheric aerosols\naffect heat and light transmission,\ncloud formation, and other climate\nphenomena and impact the health\nof living organisms. However, due\nto the complicated nature of aerosol\ninteractions and behaviour, the loading\nand boundary for these particles are yet\nto be quantified.\n8. Introduction of Novel Entities\n(Chemical Pollution) \u2013 recently\nquantified\nChemical pollution is relatively\nself-explanatory, with \u2018novel entities\u2019\ndefined as potentially toxic and long-lasting substances that are introduced to\necosystems. Examples of novel entities\ninclude heavy metals such as lead and\nmercury, chemicals such as pesticides\nand detergents, radioactive materials,\nand microplastics. Invasive species can\nalso be considered \u2018novel entities\u2019, as\nthey can have an extended and harmful\nimpact on their new environments. A\nnew scientific paper has defined the\nboundary for novel entities as \u2018when\nannual production and release increases\nat a pace that outstrips global capacity\nfor assessment and monitoring\u2019. They\nalso concluded that this is the case, and\nwe are already operating outside the safe\nspace for novel entities.\n9. Stratospheric Ozone Depletion\nThe ozone layer is a vital entity in the\nstratosphere that filters out harmful UV\nradiation from sunlight on its way to\nEarth. Ozone-depleting substances can\ndestroy this protective layer, creating a\nclear path in the atmosphere for UV rays\ntopassthrough.SevereUVradiationcan\ncause scorching of the Earth\u2019s surface,\naffecting both land and sea ecosystems,\nas well as causing skin cancers.\nFortunately, the Montreal Protocol,\nwhich regulates emissions of ozone-depleting substances (see Issue 1798\u2019s\nScience section), has been successful in\nallowing the ozone layer to repair itself\n\u2013 a huge win for environmental policy!\nThe planetary boundaries are\nimportant for shaping and directing\nhuman activity going forward, and\ndefining the current degree of severity\nfor each category can inform the issues\nthat policymakers and governing\nbodies focus on. Despite their distinct\ncategorisation, there is no denying the\ninterconnectednessofeacharea,centring\naround the cores of climate change\nand biosphere integrity. Adapting our\nbehaviour to improve one category will\ninevitably have a positive impact on\nsome of the others.\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 20TH MAY 2022\nHahyun Lee Environment Editor\n9\nENVIRONMENT\n\n"

    "content": "Let us quickly run through encryption in a communication set-ting: When we communicate, two\ntypes of data are encountered: content data (\u201cHey happy birthday today,\nAlicia!\u201d) and metadata (Bob sent to\nAlicia, May 20th\n, 12:37pm, location:\nSouth Kensington, battery: 54%...).\nEnd-to-endencryption(E2EE)means\nthat content data can only be read by\nAlicia and Bob, not by any other person\nor the communication provider (such as\nWhatsApp, Facebook Messenger etc.).\nNonetheless, metadata is key for com-paniesandgovernmentstorunanalytics.\nOne can derive very detailed social networks by looking at who communicates\n(howoften,atwhattimeetc.)withsome-one else. For instance, a high frequency\nof messages, particularly at night, might\npointtoapartner,whilemessagesduring\n9amto5pmmightbetiedtoco-workers.\nUsing metadata in this manner, it is\nrelatively easy to understand who one\u2019s\nclosecontactsare.Thisbasicinformation\nis already valuable, even if third parties\ndo not have access to the messages themselves (content data). If companies know\nyour friend just bought a MacBook,\nthis could also be interesting to you and\nshowing Apple ads may be especially valuable (called collaborative marketing).\nIn our society, there are three major groups that have interests in\nthe digital space: criminals, governments (with its police/intelli-gence services), and companies.\nI) Criminals\nCybercrime is on the rise, and it is\nnatural that we want to protect ourselves from it. It is estimated that by\n2025 global cybercrime will cost $10.5\ntrillion in damage annually. To put this\nin perspective \u2013 comparing the cost of\ncybercrime to GDPs would place cyber-crime right behind the two biggest economies in the world, USA and China.\nCybercriminal activities can range\nfrom phishing emails (e.g. fake emails\nfrom your bank that ask for your PIN),\nto ransomware attacks (the criminal\nsteals your data and asks for a ransom to unencrypt it), or using data\nleaks to gain username/password\ncombinations for different services.\nBest tips to protect yourself personal-ly: use passwords only once per service\n(use password managers to keep track),\nactivate MFA \u2013 Multi-Factor Authentication, keep your software updated, and\nencrypt your data \u2013 so that if your device\nis stolen, your data cannot be accessed.\nII) Governments\nIn an increasingly digital world, governments are pushing for legal access\nto more of our data, in order to fight\ncrime more effectively. Last week, remarkable news broke that the EU plans\nto build backdoors in E2E encrypted\ncommunication (used by WhatsApp,\nSignal and Co.) \u2013 to better investigate child pornography. Despite this,\nmany childcare organizations, such\nas the Deutscher Kinderschutzbund\n(German Child Protection Alliance),\nhave said that scanning all communication is unnecessary and disproportion-ate, as only a tiny proportion of child\npornography happens via messengers.\nThis fires the assumption that\npoliticians use the argument of\nchild pornography to gain more access to data for their own benefit.\nHere it might help to distinguish between free (such as UK, USA, Canada),\npartial-free (such as Singapore, Philippines), and non-free countries (such as\nChina, Turkey). For years, we have seen\na quite stable proportion of non-free\ncountries, but an increasing number of\ncountries are becoming more authoritar-ian. The rise of digital technology may\nhave facilitated this shift \u2013 control of the\nInternet is tempting for governments, as\nitisaneffectiveresourceforowningcon-versation: Digital surveillance allows to\nidentify and control controversial views\nand to monitor opposition members.\nAnd in free countries? It is hard to say.\nTosomeextent,digitalsurveillancehelps\nto prevent crime and terrorism (as in all\ncountries). At the same time, it provides\ndemocratic governments with more\npower \u2013 and though they may not use\nit today in anti-democratic ways, they\ncould in the future, for instance, by identifying (and possibly fighting against)\nopposing views to the government.\nIII) Companies\nShoshana Zuboff (American Author,\nHarvard professor) has established the\nterm Surveillance Capitalism. Her argument reads as follows: Companies,\nin the neo-capitalistic world, seek to\nmaximise profits. Increasing access to\ndata in the past few decades has provided them with a new way to do so.\nBy analysing data, companies are\nnot only able to better understand cus-tomers, but \u2013 and this is the crucial\npart \u2013 are able to predict and trigger\ndemand from a specific person. A good\nillustrative example is Pok\u00e9mon Go; you\nmight remember the hype in summer\n2016 about collecting Pok\u00e9 Balls while\nwalking around with your smartphone.\nWhat many do not know is that com-panies, for instance fast-food chains like\nMcDonalds, paid Nintendo to place\nvaluable Pok\u00e9 Balls in their restaurants.\nThe idea is simple \u2013 people walking\ninto a McDonalds to catch a Pok\u00e9mon\nare far more likely to buy a Big Mac.\nObviously, the hype behind\nPok\u00e9mon Go is gone today. However, it shows effectively that even\nbehind a fun, free game, companies will go for ways to make money.\nAnd this mechanism also applies\nwhen we google or scroll through Instagram\u2019sorTikTok\u2019snewsfeed.Companies\nshow us targeted ads \u2013 things they know\nwe are interested in and would buy. This\nconsequently leads to far more effective\nadvertisements \u2013 more people are buying the promoted products or services,\nwhich increases revenues for companies.\nTry an experiment yourself, the last time\nyou bought something online: Have\nyou seen an ad before buying these new\nwireless earphones? If so, would you\nhave bought them if you had not seen\nthe advertisement? Often enough, we\nwould have not. And in those scenarios,\nour demand was manipulated. It is like\nparents knowing your favourite sweets\n\u2013 and motivating you to tidy up your\nroom if you want yet another yummy\nchocolate ice cream. We do what they\nwant because parents know what we\nwant. And today firms know this, too.\nNonetheless, data privacy and security are very important \u2013 stay tuned for\nnext weeks how-to guide: What you can\ndo to better protect your digital privacy!\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n4\nMarc Richly Tech Writer\nEdited by: Jamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nWhy encryption?\nLast week, tech writer Marc Richly gave a general overview about encryption types.

    "content": "Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWith the recent quantification of\n\u2018novel entities\u2019, one of the nine\nplanetary boundaries, you may be think-ing: what are these planetary bound-aries, what do they mean, and how do\nthey relate to climate change and environmental issues? Well, if you were wondering (and even if you weren\u2019t), here is\na brief rundown of the boundaries and\nwhy they are significant for our future.\nThe \u2018planetary boundaries\u2019 were\ndefined and developed in 2009 by\nSwedish scientist Johan Rockstr\u00f6m and\na group of researchers at the Stockholm\nResilience Centre to describe a set\nof quantifiable categories for Earth\u2019s\necological systems and processes. Each\ncategory details how humanity is\nimpacting the health of the planet and\nhelps us direct our focus toward the\nareas that need it most. The boundaries\nare quantified with respect to a \u2018safe\noperating space\u2019, within which we can\nmaintaintheconditionsoftheHolocene\n(our current climate era).\n1. Climate Change \u2013 core\nClimate change is a term most of us\nknow all too well. While it seems the\nterm \u2018climate change\u2019 (or \u2018climate crisis\u2019)\nis becoming synonymous with the\nidea of a potential apocalyptic future,\nit is important to distinguish it as an\nindividual environmental issue among\nmany. It is, however, defined as a \u2018core\u2019\ncategory, as it tends to create knock-on\neffects for the other boundaries.\nClimate change refers specifically to\nchanges in seasonal weather patterns for\ndifferent areas of the Earth. Deviation of\na country\u2019s climate from how it should\nbe at a given time of year negatively\naffects its ecosystems.\nA quintessential example is the later\nfreezing and earlier melting of polar\nice caps in winter. This is caused by the\nwarming of the Arctic circle\u2019s climate\nand results in habitat loss for polar bears\n(among other creatures), for whom the\nice caps are a winter home. The impact\nof a decrease in polar bears reverberates\nthroughout the ecosystem, with more\nseals (a bear delicacy), resulting in lower\nlevels of fish in the sea.\nClimate change is quantified\nby average surface temperature\nmeasurements over different parts of the\nplanet (degree of relative warming).\n2. Change in Biosphere Integrity \u2013\ncore\nBiosphere integrity refers to the\nbalance between living creatures\nand resources on the planet, and\nthe maintenance of biodiversity.\nPreviously named \u2018biodiversity loss\u2019,\nthis boundary quantifies the extinction\nand endangerment of animal and plant\nspecies due to human activity and\nenvironmental changes. This is also a\ncore category, as biodiversity is a key\nfactor in maintaining the health and\nnatural balance of ecosystems.\n- Extinctions per Million Species per\nYear (E/MSY)\nA relatively easily quantifiable\nvalue, the baseline rate has generally\nbeen estimated as 1 E/MSY (without\nhuman intervention). By comparison,\nthe current rate is estimated to be 100-1000 E/MSY at best, which has brought\nabout discussions of us being part of the\n\u2018sixth mass extinction event\u2019. Extinction\nevents occur when the extinction rate\nsignificantly exceeds the baseline, such\nas at the end of the Cretaceous period\n(when dinosaurs were wiped out).\n- Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) \u2013\nnot fully quantified\nSimilar (but not identical) to the\nextinction rate, the BII measures how\nwell a given area\u2019s biodiversity has been\nmaintained. For an ecosystem to be well-functioning and resilient, it should have\na BII of over 90%, while the BII of an at-risk ecosystem would be under 30%. As\nit stands, global BII values range from\naround 30% to 90% (by country). The\nUK is in the lowest 15% of countries,\nwith a BII of ~50%.\n3. Land-System Change\nIn the land-system change boundary,\na \u2018land-system\u2019 is any area of land that\ncontributes to an ecosystem. A major\nexample of a land-system change is the\nconversion of natural forests, wetlands,\netc., into arable land for farming. The\ndeforestation involved in this process\nresults in decreased biodiversity and\ndecreased natural carbon capture. Landsystemchangesalsohaveimplicationsfor\nfood security, as there is less variation in\nfood sources for wildlife, and genetically\nsimilar crops are also more likely to\nsuccumb to diseases. This change is\nquantified by the percentage of wildland\ntransformed into land for farming or\nother human activities.\n4. Freshwater Use\nWe have known for a long time that\nfreshwater is a scarce and\nlimitedresource\u2013only3%of\nthe world\u2019s water is fresh and\ndrinkable, and 2.5% of that\nis trapped in ice, soil, and the\natmosphere. We generally\nhavewater-treatmentsystems\nfor well-connected cities and\nsuburban areas, but many\nunderdeveloped countries\nstill do not. The populations\nof such countries are \u2013 or\nare in danger of \u2013 being\nsubjected to freshwater\nshortages. Not only is our\nownsocietyheavilyrelianton\nthe resource of fresh water,\nbut so are millions of species\nofwildlife.Thesafeoperating\nboundary for freshwater use\nhas been set to 4000 km3/year, and we\ncurrently use about half of that value,\nalthough demand is significantly higher,\nand around 70% of the freshwater used\nis for agriculture alone.\n5. Biogeochemical Flows\nIn layman\u2019s terms, with respect to\nsoil and plant health, biogeochemical\nflows are the movement of the essential\nelements nitrogen and phosphorus, vital\nfor healthy plant growth. The carbon\ncycle is also a biogeochemical flow\nsystem \u2013 one which has been altered\nsignificantly by increases in carbon\nemissions - but this is not quantified as\npart of this category.\n- Nitrogen Cycle\nNitrogen travels through the\nbiosphere through absorption by plants\nsuch as algae, which are then eaten by\nanimals(e.g.fish),trappedintheirwaste,\nand then released back into the system\n(soil or water) through decomposition.\nThe artificial addition of excess nitrogen\ninto the environment through fossil\nfuels and fertilisers is disruptive to the\nnatural cycles of nitrogen. Nitrates can\nfeed algae to the point that they choke\nother wildlife of oxygen in water systems\n(eutrophication), while nitrous oxides\ncontribute to pollution and ozone\ndepletion. Human activity contributes\nto more nitrogen processing than all-natural cycles combined, creating\nhuge excesses of reactive nitrogen and\nnitrogen-based compounds.\n- Phosphorus Cycle\nPhosphorus is cycled similarly\nto nitrogen but without any of its\ncompounds being released into\nthe atmosphere. Again, artificial\nintroductions of phosphorus and\nphosphates in fertilisers can disrupt the\nbalance of the phosphorus cycle, causing\nwater pollution and excessive algal\ngrowth. Phosphorus and phosphate\nproduction by humans is only slightly\nlower than that of nitrogen.\n6. Ocean Acidification\nThe acidification of oceans is a topic\nrelated to climate change, as it too\nresults from greenhouse gas emissions\n\u2013 specifically carbon dioxide. As carbon\ndioxide dissolves into seas and oceans,\nit forms carbonic acid, which lowers\nthe pH of the water and has damaging\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n8\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie Mori\nHahyun Lee\nEnvironment\nExplaining the nine planetary boundaries\nRockstr\u00f6m\u2019s nine planetary boundaries\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\nZanna Buckland Books Editor\n\n"

    "content": "Let me make it completely clear from the\nbeginning that this could be the most biased\narticle I have ever written (even more than the time\nI had to write about my own band). I absolutely\nadore Hippo Campus. They\u2019re the first band I can\nremember being properly into. The music video\nfor \u2018South\u2019 appeared on my YouTube sidebar while\nI watched videos after school in Year 10 so, once\nagain, I\u2019m forced to thank an algorithm that will\nnever appreciate or know what it has done for me. I\nmanaged to see the band live a couple of years later\nwhen they came from their home of Minnesota to\nmy not-home-but-closest-gig-venue of Newcastle.\nIt was there that I saw the best gig of my life up till\nthen \u2013 emphasis on \u201cup till then\u201d because they outdid\nthemselves on their trip to London this week.\nAfter hours in the library studying for my\nQuantum Physics exam the next day, I rushed from\nFulham to Highbury & Islington (endless thanks\nto Citymapper) just in time to catch the end of the\nsupport act, Frankie Beetlestone. At this point I\nwasn\u2019t going to write an article about the night but as\nsoon as Hippo Campus stepped on stage, I changed\nmy mind. The band entered with the hypnotic \u20182\nYoung 2 Die\u2019, singer Jake Luppen choosing the left\nof his two mics\nto use. Yes, he\nhad two mics,\nI was confused\ntoo. This mic\nwas overflowing\nwith effects from\nfuturistic pitch\nshifting to otherworldly echoes\nand delays. When\nthe band released\ntheir new album LP3, I wrote about my excitement\nto see how they would recreate the heavily produced\nsounds they had tailored on the record. The obvious\nanswer came seeing them live. They simply have all\nthose effects with them on stage. Luppen shifted and\nmanipulated his vocals with the dials and buttons\nconnected to the mic as he sang. These tones were\nmost prominent in \u2018Sex Tape\u2019 and \u2018Bad Dream Baby\u2019\nfrom electronic EP Good Dog, Bad Dream which\ntook me a while to get into when it was released but\nnow, after seeing it live, might be my new favourite\nHippo Campus record.\nOpposingly, the other mic was just set up as\nnormal, enhanced\nonly by some\ndelicate reverb.\nOne of the things\nthat drew me to\nthe band when I\nfirst listened to\nthem was Luppen\u2019s\nvocal range and\nthe ways he could\ncontort his voice,\ndiving from silky\nhighs to coarse\ngrowls. In \u2018Boys\u2019,\na single from LP3, Luppen swapped mics for effects\nwhen singing the choruses, and returning to the\nnormal mic for the verses. Everyone is used to seeing\na guitarist fiddle with pedals for the perfect sound\nbut doing the same for vocals made for an innovative\nset that lived up to the encapsulating standard of the\nstudio recordings.\nWhile the vocals are astonishing, Hippo Campus\nreally shine when they spotlight their fifth member,\nDeCarlo Jackson, who plays the trumpet and various\npercussion instruments. My lacklustre note-taking\nabilities shone again during the trumpet solos: I just\nwrote \u201cTRUMPET\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t stop talking about the\ntrumpet\u201d. Essentially, I loved the trumpet parts, they\nadded a majestic layer to every song that you usually\ndon\u2019t find with the indie bands who have similar\nsounds to Hippo Campus.\nI could write about every song the band played,\nthough eventually I think you\u2019d get bored of the\nendless gushing. Hippo Campus have grown\nmassively as a live act, and as a band generally, since I\nlast saw them in Newcastle. They had a confidence on\nstage in London that they previously lacked. Luppen\nexuded energy, matching the crowd who had missed\ntheir presence\nthis side of the\nAtlantic. I can\nonly hope that\nthe band keep\nthe promise\nthey made on\nstage to come\nvisit the UK\nmore often.\n13\nMusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Tara Pal Chaudhuri\nJoe Riordan\nMusic\nView online here!\nPull out your eyeliner, dig\nout your skinnny jeans,\nMy Chemical Romance\nare back!

    "content": "Once upon a time, there lived a fisherman. Or,\nrather, a man who fished, unprofessionally but\nvery often; an addicted man in fact, a man obsessed,\nwhose only waking thought is of where his next line\nwill come from. A man whose obsession with all things\npiscine drives his son insane, and destroys his family.\nThus begins Fanatyk, a 2017 Polish short film directed by Michal Tylka. The film is a 33 minute fea-turette, based on arguably the most famous \u2018copypasta\u2019\non the Polish side of the internet. Commonly referred\nto by its first line, \u201cM\u00f3j stary to fanatyk w\u0119dkarstwa\u201d,\ntranslated as \u201cmy old man is a fishing fanatic\u201d, is a story written by a user known only as \u2018Malcolm XD\u2019 and\noriginallypublished,well,somewhere.Dubiousorigins\nare characteristic of \u2018copypastas\u2019 such as this, although\nmy research in this specific case was admittedly limited by the fact that I can\u2019t speak Polish. A \u2018copypasta\u2019,\nif you aren\u2019t familiar with the term, is a popular internet story posted somewhere - often on popular sites\nlike 4chan or Reddit - and \u2018copied\u2019 and \u2018pasted\u2019 again\nand again for comedic value, with slight edits here and there. The etymology is clear.\nThe film itself follows the original story\nquite closely, that of a son slowly driven mad by his dad\u2019s fanatic fishing.\nThe house fills up with discarded\nhooks and magazines that bankrupt the family. His father gets\ninto regular fights with his fishing buddies about whether\ncarp are better than catfish.\nThey eat fish every day\n\u2013 that\u2019s the only reason you\ngot into college, his dad says.\nThese scenes are interspersed\nwith the son\u2019s narration, verbatim from the original text.\nIt\u2019s genuinely quite a funny,\nwell-paced comedy, and the\nmain cast manage to sell the\nsubject matter with just the right amount of sincerity.\nIt\u2019s the seriousness with which they handle the story\nthat makes it funny \u2013 if it were any goofier, I\ndon\u2019t think it would have landed quite as\nwell. The Polish sense of humour probably has something to do with that.\nFanatyk is currently streaming\non UK Netflix, and at the low\ntemporal cost of 33 minutes\nit fits almost perfectly into\na single \u2018pomodoro\u2019 of your\nexam season studies. I also\nrecommend finding an English translation of the original\ncopypasta, if you aren\u2019t Polish.\nUnder The Silver Lake is what would happen if\nAndrew Garfield\u2019s Peter Parker did a bunch of\nacid, had an awful trip, and slept about five hours per\nweek. Or maybe if he just lived in L.A instead of New\nYork. It\u2019s a neo-noir homage to pop culture and conspiracy theories \u2013 the good kind of conspiracy theories,\nabout hidden messages in Beatles songs and the Masonic Lodge, not the bad modern ones about vaccines\nand poorly shaped planets. Those were the days, man.\nSam, a 33 year old man with a pretty nice apartment\nand no discernible form of income, is fascinated by\ncryptic messages in songs and comic books. He wanders about with his hands in his pockets and looking\nslightly bewildered \u2013 an expression which Garfield\nreally has mastered at this point \u2013 and meets a woman living in the same apartment complex as him. They\nsmoke weed together one night, and she and her room\nmates have all moved out the very next morning. Her\ndisappearance starts a cascade of unexpected events\ninvolving such characters as a naked murderer owl\nlady, a skunk, a dog murderer, a songwriter, homeless royalty, and an elite cult \u2013 to name just a few.\nThe plot is thick with cyclical detail, and it really is\nimpossible to tell where it\u2019ll go next. That\u2019s a risky play\nin a narrative, but the film does err on the side of keep-ingyouinterestedwithoutbeingtooindulgentlyweird.\nThe soundtrack - primarily written by American\ncomposer Disasterpeace - absolutely rocks, brilliantly marrying mid-century mystery with late-80s pop.\nGarfield\u2019s performance is central to the film, assisted\nby a brilliant cast of supporting actors including Riley\nKeough and Jimmi Simpson. It really is a film that\u2019s\ndifficult to put into words, so I recommend you just\ngive it a shot next time you\u2019re in the mood for a puzzle.\nM\u00f3j stary to fanatyk w\u0119dkarstwa...\nFanatyk\nFelix recommends\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nJonah Hewett\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nUnder the Silver Lake\nDirectedby: Michal Tyka\nStarring: Piotr Cyrwus, Mikolaj Kubacki\nCountry: Poland\nYear: 2017\nListen up, cryptic crossword enjoyers\nDirectedby: David Robert-Mitchell\nStarring: Andrew Garfield.
