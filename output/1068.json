    "content": "12 LETTERS FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nreplied to this week by David Roberts\nClayponds security -Residents demand value for money\nDear Editor,\nAs residents of Clayponds village\nwe would like to air our personal\nviews on the security problem and\naddress some of the issues that Mr\nCaldwell raised in his letter last\nweek.\nThe claim that Mr Caldwell and\nhis colleagues are listening to the\nClayponds community is true, but\nunfortunately it's going in one ear\nand out of the other. Take the recent\nmeeting at Clayponds hospital, in our\nopinion an unmitigated farce It's our\nrecollection, as indeed Mr Caldwell\nstates, that nothing was ruled out but\nequally nothing was ruled in (status\nquo?). In fact as far as we can\nremember every idea proposed from\nthe floor met with a myriad of negative responses as to why that security\nmeasure would be wholly inappropriate for Clayponds. The two\nfavourites were (1) bars on windows\n- obviously an excellent idea used on\nbasement flats throughout London\n(2) deadlocks - likewise an excellent\nidea recommended by insurance\ncompanies and crime prevention\nofficers. Remarks by Mr Caldwell\nabout \"Alcatraz\" speak for them-selves. The range of excuses for not\nfulfil ing these measures beggared\nbelief. In fact you'd wonder how the\ncompanies that sell them ever managed to stay in business if there were\nsuch great associated fire (and other)\nhazards.\nWe are fed up to the back teeth\nwith the lack of vision, the short term\nreactionary measures, incompetence\n(keys?) and worst of all the blas e attitude that seems to pervade i.e.a determined intruder will get in anyway so security investments are a waste of time. \"Somebody has to pay\nfor it\" and we already are thank you\nvery much, in the form of regular\nbreak-ins and soaring insurance pre-miu ms. The questionnaire was tantamount to an admission that security\nmeasures need to be taken but\nEstates aren't prepared to pay for\nthem. Why else would you ask us if\nwe would accept a rent rise to pay for\nsecurity upgrades'?\nAs for our new carpets Mr\nCaldwell, they're very nice thank\nyou very much. You might be interested to know however, that the\n\"old\" carpets in our houses had years\nleft in them, still there you go.\nLastly the dog patrols are a very\ngood idea. Full marks to whoever\nthought of that one. However on the\ndown side the guard appears to spend\nmost of his time sat in his van and\ntherefore it wouldn't take very long\nto work out his patrol pattern would\nit? Ever seen \"The Great Escape\" ?\nMr Caldwell also neglected to mention that these security patrols are at\npresent, only a temporary measure.\nNo prizes for guessing the innovative\nway in which this scheme will be\nfinanced if and when it becomes per-man ent. Yours sincerely,\nAdrian Bennett & Nick Stock\nDear Editor,\nAs a resident of Garden Hall, I have been worried to read in recent\nissues of Felix that dead-locks are\nconsidered to be a fire safety hazard,\nas all Garden Hall rooms are fitted\nwith one. However, following recent\nfire drills the dead-locks posed no\nproblems to escaping residents. I therefore wondered whether the safety of Clayponds residents is a higher\npriority than that of Garden Hall res-idents, or whether this is simply a case of double standards?\nYoursfaithfully,\nA Cherrington\nDear Editor,\nI am writing in response to Mr\nCaldwell's letter in last weeks Felix\nconcerning the 'impressions' given\nabout Clayponds security. As a long\nstanding resident of the a fore men-tio ned establishment, I was rather\ninsulted by some of the throw-away\ncomments made in Mr Caldwell's letter. 'Some students even liked the\nnew carpets!!' for instance. Well of\ncourse we like the carpets. That, Mr\nCaldwell, is not the point.\nThe issue here, which you and Mr\nDaniels seem to gloss over at every\nopportunity, is one of priorities. I am\nnot disputing the fact that some of the\ncarpets were in need of replacement.\nHowever, if 160 grand can be found\nfor this purpose, then 40 more seems\na small price to pay for decent locks\non front doors.\nWe have also heard through the\ngrapevine that we are to get a common room costing in excess of\n\u00a340000.1 don't remember ever being\nconsulted about this. If you tried asking ALL of the students where they\nthink the money should be spent,\nlocks or TV lounge, I think you\nmight find the solution to your problems regarding the funding of security upgrades. You will of course tell\nme that both carpets and common\nroom are from separate grants. Fine,\nwell how about trying to raise some\ncash for security upgrades? I am able\nto break into my own house in under\none minute without breaking any\nwindows or door frames. If you\nwould like a demonstration of this, I would be only to happy to oblige.\nOne last point, although there\ncould be many more, what exactly\nare the 'fire-safety implications' of\nputting deadlocks on doors? Are you\nseriously trying to tell readers that\nyour own residence, or for that matter virtually every other home in the\ncountry, is not fitted with a decent\nlock? Stop trying to fob us off with\nfeeble excuses. Fulfil the College's obligations as landlord by making\nsure that we have British Standards\napproved deadlocks on the doors.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Payne\nThe residents (ie those who are\npaying for Clayponds to be run,\nsecured, and covered in new car-pet) would appear to be of one\nmind. Mr Caldwell (who is also\npaid by the students for that mat-ter) please note.\nGun Lobby states the\ncase for the defence\nDear Editor,\nWe are writing to correct the letter\n\"Dunblane Answer\" (Felix 1067).\nWhilst we respect the views of\nRichard Sandiford, his letter indicates a poor appreciation of the facts.\nHe should have re-read the article.\nIt clearly explains that Lord Cullen's report concluded that a complete ban\non handguns is a totally unnecessary\nstep, and the proposals of his report\nwould provide ample security in the\nfuture. The government seems to\nhave forgotten what it means to gov-ern, and has instead succumbed to\nthe press induced hysteria that has\nrendered balanced argument impossible. As to the point about the difficulty\nof pronouncing someone dangerous\nor safe, in cases where someone is\nseriously unbalanced, the person will\nnot instantly collapse into such a state, but will reach this level after a more gradual loss of faculties. The\nlaw, bolstered by the proposals of the\nCullen Report, and aided by the\nshooters themselves would deny\naccess to firearms for anyone considered to be in anyway unsuitable.\nWhilst it is never possible to be completely sure about someone's mental\nstate, those connected with shooting\nalways favour caution, and will\nnever give the benefit of the doubt.\nImperial College rifle and pistol\nclub\nBut surely the law has always been\nintended to deny access to\nfirearms from psychopaths - yet\nThomas Hamilton still obtained a firearms licence. Of course, those\nwho really want access to guns will\nalways be able to obtain them illegally - but if Hamilton had been\nforced to break into a gun club or\na armour y, it might have given the\npolice a slightly higher chance of\ncatching him before he murdered\nso many innocent children.\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those\nof the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1069\nis Monday 11th November.\nPlease bring some form of identification. Letters may be e mailed\nto our address: felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER\nSecurity breach blamed on students\nNEWS TEAM Following a significant breach of hall\nsecurity, students have been reminded not to let strangers into College\nresidences and to alert Security if\nthey see anyone suspicious. This\ncomes in the wake of an incident on\nSunday night in Evelyn Gardens\nwhen an intruder entered Holbein\nHall despite high levels of security.\nA man is believed to have gained\nentry by jumping the back garden\nwall and climbing in through the\nbasement of house number 62, at\naround 11.45pm. He then proceeded\nto wander in and out of open student\nrooms unchallenged before exiting\nvia an open ground floor window,\nleaving the back doors still on the\nlatch.\nA number of male students using a nearby hall kitchen noticed the\nintruder and turned off the light in\norder to observe him without being\nseen. They were later able to provide\nCollege Security officials with a detailed description of the stranger,\nwho was black, 6'3\" tall, had tied-back dreadlocks and was wearing an\norange T shirt with a black jacket\nand jeans. The students had previously spotted a shorter black male,\npossibly an accomplice, acting suspiciously in the doorway of number 62\nbut were unable to give a fuller\ndescription.\nAs soon as they were notified, a security guard accompanied Mr\nTravis, the warden, in a hasty search\nof the building. By this time the trespassers had disappeared. Believing\nthere might still be a threat to res i dents, the security officer remained\nin the darkened kitchen for some\ntime but saw nothing unusual.\nUproar at Wilson House\nMATT KEMP TON Students at St Mary's Medical\nSchool are angry that non-medics\nhave been given places in Wilson\nHouse. 10 empty rooms were advertised two weeks ago and all but two\nhave now been taken up by IC students from South Kensington.\nThe root of this discontent can be\ntraced back to last April, when clinical students started applying for\nplace in the hall. First year clinical\nstudents were advised not to apply\nbecause their chance of success was\nthought to be slim, with priority\ngoing to finalists and fresher s. Speaking to Felix, Bryan Clarke, the\nWarden of Wilson House, said the\nrooms had become available for a short period because some of the residents had travelled abroad to carry\nout the elective study that forms part\nof their course. He went on to point\nout that no medical students applied\nfor the rooms after the advertisement\nhad gone up.\nMedical students, however, told a very different story. They argued that\nthese spare rooms could have been\nforeseen and that they should have\nbeen offered to the first year clinical\nstudents. The rooms were not being\nsought after now because the displeased students had already found\nalternative accommodation, for\nwhich they have to pay at least twice\nthe rent of Wilson House.\nMr Clarke stoutly defended the\nallocation policy. It was his opinion\nthat the availability of the rooms\nconcerned could not been predicted\nas it depended on what options the\nstudents took. The medics, though,\nwere not convinced that this was\nsimply another bureaucratic cock up\non the part of the College. Most of\nthem saw this as a well orchestrated\nman ou vre by IC to start introducing\nnon-medics into Wilson House, and\nin doing so break an earlier promise\nthat Wilson House would remain\nsolely for clinical students after the\nmerger in 1998.\nMr Clarke put up a brave face by\nsaying, \"The students feel threat-en ed,I understand that.\" Clinical students starting their day at 6.30 am,\nand not finishing until 10.30 pm for\nfull 48 weeks of their academic year\non top of this, they need to do this for\n48 weeks a year can have their life\nmade easier by the College if they\ncan kindly provide them with accommodation. The future could be more\ncongested; with the formation of the\nnew ICSM, there will be 320 students in a year, which is beyond the\ncapacity of Wilson House.\nBookstore tender passed\ncontinued from front page\ntheir second reading with continued\ndisquiet regarding some of their\nimplications. ICU Council confirmed its decision to follow the\nmodel of the Conservative Party in\nallowing their Appeals Committee to\nincrease penalties and fines imposed\nby a Union Disciplinary Committee.\nThe Health and Safety policy was\namended to allow lists of students\npartaking in \"External Activities\" to\nbe submitted two days prior to an\nevent. Previous suggestions that lists\nshould be provided seven days prior\nto an activity taking place received\nrepeated objections. The Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies) also\nconceded that names of students partaking in regular activities can be\nsubmitted on one occasion for a number of events.\nThe Publicity Policy, facing its\nfirst reading following its withdrawal from the previous Council meet-ing, also came in for repeated attack.\nSome Council members had reservations about the instruction that all\nwriting on both posters and flyers\nshould be in the English language.\nThis may prove especially difficult\nfor Overseas Clubs and Societies\nwhose logos contain words in a foreign language, and for those wishing\nto include the Imperial College logo\nin their publicity, as it contains Latin.\nConstituent College Union officials combined to defeat most of the\nsabbatical officers in an amendment\nwhich will allow CCUs to control\npublicity relating to their Clubs and\nSocieties.\nNews in Brief\nEXTREMISM RETURNS\nExtreme Islamic student group\nactivity throughout London University is on the rise again after a lull of\nseveral months. Reports of fundamental activity at fresher s' fairs and\nother union events have multiplied\nsince the summer.\nIn order to evade University or\nUnion jurisdiction, Islamic group\nmembers have been distributing\nleaflets just outside the entrance of\nKing's College in London. The\nleaflets end with mobile phone numbers which are apparently un trace able. When questioned, the student\nleaflet ers admitted that they were not\nbased at Kings but were from other\nLondon colleges.\nThe often controversial ideas of\nfundamentalist Muslims have caused\nproblems in other universities in\nEngland as well, with an Islamic\ngroup in Liverpool University shut\ndown after trying to ban the Jewish\nsociety.\nThis mirrors problems suffered by\ncolleges in the past few years where\nsuch groups did not advertise in their\nown college but went to others to\navoid being recognised. A statement\nfrom King's College Union stated\n\"We find it important to protect our\nstudents from fundamentalism, especially the religious type. King's has\nhad problems with such groups of all\nfaiths in the past.\"\nOXFAM FAST\nAt least one hundred and twenty people from Imperial College will be\ntaking part in Oxfam's national Fast\nfor Basic Rights on 15th November.\nThis event is being held to raise\nawareness of poverty and human\nrights. In the UK, 14.1 million people live in poverty, and worldwide,\n800 million do not have enough to\neat. The fast involves people spending 24 hours without something that\nusually they take for granted, for\nexample food or cigarettes. Anyone\ninterested in taking part should contact Oxfam Campaign.\nBIKE THIEF\nAPPREHENDED\nLast week, South Kensington police\napprehended a young man in the\nprocess of stealing a bicycle near to\nCollege. At the moment, it is thought\nthat he could be responsible for some\nof the numerous other bicycle thefts\nin the area, especially in and around\ncampus. The police have detained\nhim for further questioning.\nTRAVEL WRITERS NEEDED\nExotic and unusual travel articles are\nneeded for future issues of Felix. If\nyou have interesting stories, reflections or experiences that you think\nwould make a good feature and don't mind sharing them, then we want to\nhear from you!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER LETTERS & EDITORIAL 13\nX\\ \"FE LIX\nStudent Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nDear Felix\nMr Foster, the Head of Catering\nand Conference Services has been to\nsee me in person to answer my letter\nabout sandwiches. He says that the\nCatering Department has to \"pay its\nway\" and any trading surplus is rein-vested; for example, two new chiller\ncabinets will shortly be purchased for\nQT so that a wider range of goods\ncan be displayed. Apparently the\nsandwiches cannot be sold any\ncheaper because of overheads and\nthe requirement to meet stringent\nhealth and safety standards etc. There\nare now three different suppliers of\nsandwiches, the cheapest at 99p( which now apparently includes egg\nmayonnaise, which I saw for \u00a31.10 in\nQT last week).\nLarge companies like Boots can\noften afford to offer \"loss leaders\"\nand small shops like The Sandwich\nShop on Gloucester Road, who make\nsandwiches on the premises, may\nhave lower overheads. Mr Foster\nsays that some sandwiches in the\nStudents' Union are on sale at higher\nprices than in QT.\nAll I can suggest is that you shop\naround.\nLinda Hart\nA MATTER OF POLICY\nA number of points have arisen from\nlast Tuesday's ICU Council Meeting\nwhich I feel deserve some attention.\nFirstly, there is the matter of\npapers for Council meetings not\nbeing available in time. At present,\nand I must add that this has been the\nsituation for some time, it is unfortunately the case that Council\nMembers are only given the papers\nfor a specific meeting at the start of\nthat meeting. This only gives them a few minutes to peruse all the reports,\nminutes and motions that have been\npresented to Council, a function\nwhich is, fundamentally, the role of\nthe Council. These motions are then\npassed, often with only perfunctory\ndebate, when less hurried reading of\nthe papers would allow members to\nraise valid and worthwhile points to\nbe discussed and voted upon.\nThe current practice abrogates the\nrole of Council, and thus invalidates\nthe entire democratic representative\nprocess. The Council Members are\nthere for a reason: to represent various sectors of the Imperial College\nstudent community on the\n\"Sovereign Body of Imperial\nCollege Union.\" They ought to be\ngiven the opportunity to do this, and\na step forward would be to issue the\npapers for such meetings in good\ntime. If this was the case, then there\nwould be much lesser cause for complaint when 'controversial', badly\nwritten or simply poor policies are\npassed by a confused and under\ninformed body.\nBefore I raise the next point, let me\nsay that I, in common I'm sure with\nthe majority of student opinion, do\nnot particularly favour top-up fees as\na method of relieving the funding\npressures on higher education institutions. However I do not share the\nview of the ICU's Student Representative Council that Imperial College\nUnion needs a policy statement to\nthis effect.\nThe motion to adopt such a policy\npresented to last Tuesday's Council\n(available from the Union Office if\nanyone is interested) contains much\nthat is laudable and sensible, has\nvalid supporting facts and figures\nand reaches impressive conclusions.\nIt is however, entirely to no effect,\nand I suggest, sends the wrong signals to the wrong people. All of the\ninstructions are already being followed by the sabbaticals, so why the\nneed to mandate them to do so?\nFurthermore, the motion is reactive rather than proactive, confirming\nestablished facts and measures\nalready implemented, and comes\nonly a few weeks before the next\nbudget. There is nothing therein to\ninstruct firm action, if that was the\nintent of the motion (which could be\nconsidered too little, too late in any\ncase), and if it was not intended,\nwhat is the need for such a confirmatory piece of paper?\nRestating established points, in a document that has the faint whiff of\nbandwagon about it, does not further\nthe IC students' cause, and makes\nthose who claim to represent them\nseem somewhat late and reactionary.\nUp to now, there hasn't been a need\nfor a policy, and nothing new was\npresented here. If and when policy is\nneeded with regard to taking action\nor spending money on such a cause,\nthen a mandate would be needed. But\nuntil then, the current careful diplo-macy, research and discussion would\nseem to serve rather better.\nCAREERS FAIR\nOn Wednesday the 13th of\nNovember ICU plays host to this\nyears Careers Fair. If you're already\nactively looking for a job, or you're\njust interested in what's on offer in\nthe big wide world, then get on your\nsmart clothes, and check out the fair.\nThere will be 41 companies\nattending, with vacancies in most\nareas from finance to systems an aly sis, via engineering and ma them at ics.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER COLUMNS11 Many moons ago, when I was in\nLinstead, a number of the inmates\nwere most adept at the consumption\nof alcohol (not me, of course, I was a Horlicks and bicci es man myself).\nThe current crowd, it would appear,\nare destined for the stage. Some marvellous voice projection enabled me\nto catch the following snippets as I wandered through Princes Gardens\nlast week. After carpeting Estates\nover Clayponds (don't excuse that\npun, it was awful), it would appear\nthat Security have been less than\ntheir usual flawless selves. As the\nresidents continued their con versa tion, it emerged that the wardens had\nplanned a fire drill a couple of weeks\nago. Good idea, you say, it's a legal\nrequirement. So the wardens pressed\nthe relevant button, stood outside and\nawaited the half-asleep Linsteadians.\nAnd they waited. And they waited.\nFor, dear reader, the alarm did not\nsound. Very serious, you say, someone should get a ticking off. Still they\nwould soon get it fixed, these things\nSimon Baker\nhappen, and it could all be repeated\nthe next day. Oh dear. Silent alarms\nagain. Now you do not need to be a genius to work out what would have\nhappened if there\nhad been a real\nfire. Nor do you\nhave to be\nRumpole of the\nBailey to realise\nthe legal consequences. This fire\nalarm has been\nthe subject of\nconstant complaint since\nbefore I arrived\nhere in 1993. It\ntook years to\ninstall, caused1 untold disruption y Q|c eQ f ReaSOn to students, often\nhope next week that he will tell me\nthat this is untrue and I shouldn't worry my little head about it. Or\nmaybe not.\nThis on its own\nis very serious,\nJbut. in the word\nof a very unfunny\nman, there's more. The subject\nchanged and talk\nof ambulances\ndrifted down\nfrom the balcony.\nApparently, a couple of\nSaturdays ago,\nsomeone had an\nasthma attack in\nLinstead Bar.\nCall Security,\nyou cry, and so\nare on top form, they make the\nKeystone Cops look like the AntiTerrorist Squad.\nduring exams, and now we find, like\nBasil Fawlty before us, that when we\nwant use it, the damn thing doesn't work. The name of the Fire Officer\nGraham Cox was mentioned. I do\nthey did. Oh dear. The number was\nengaged. This is scandalous. What is\nthe use of routing all emergency calls\nthrough College Security if they are\nleft in limbo like this? When Security\nBit short of space this week, so the\nstate of education in Britain will have\nto wait a while. So finally, it is a joy\nto say something wholly positive\nabout this dear old place. I refer to\nlast week's Commemoration day.\nCongratulations must go to my good\nfriends in the College Registry, under\nthe able leadership of Vernon\nMcClure (I got it right this time!).\nWe've not seen eye to eye in the past,\nbut this time you came through with\nflying colours, and who cares if it\nwas a week late. From start to finish,\nit was thoroughly enjoyable and the\nmemorable occasion that one's graduation should be. The ball in the\nevening was also a stunning success\nand full marks to all involved in that.\nSo to all you fresher s out there, Uncle\nSimon says stick at that degree,\nbecause the finale is well worth waiting for.\nHey there! Fancy spending your next summer in Delaware?\nDela-where? I hear you say.\nDelaware, in the USA! Well, the\nUROP-Delaware Exchange Scheme\nallows you to do just that. Each year\nfive IC students spend 8 week's doing research at the University of\nDelaware (UD). This is not only an\nexcellent opportunity to pump up\nyour CV by working overseas, but\nalso to help those students facing the\ndilemma of staying on to do a PhD. or\ngo and get a 'real' job, by giving\nthem an idea of what research is all\nabout. If you already know what you\nwant to do then that's fine too, since\nyou can still have tons of fun and\nexperience the American way of life.\nUD has a very different environment from that of IC. For a start, it's a campus-based university in the\nsmall city of Newark. UDs reputation\nmainly lies in their chemical engineering dept, partly due to the connections they have with DuPont.\nThey rank 6th in the country.\nHowever, many of their other departments are also well respected and\nacknowledged in their fields of\nresearch. Newark itself does not have\na sophisticated public transport system as London, but not to worry, UD\nkindly lends the IC students' cycles\nfor the summer and provides cars for\nweekend travels.\nFrom a financial perspective you\nwill receive a total of $2000. UD provides a stipend of $1500 to live on,\nand a sponsoring company (usually\nZeneca) contributes $500 towards\nairfare. It's up to you how you spend\nyour money. You can blow it all and\nend up using credit cards or even\ncome back with $700. However, you\nwill be strongly advised to take out\nhealth insurance with an American\ncompany, for just over $100, for the\ntime you are there. This is just in case\nyou happen to crack your knee during\nice-skating or need the odd root\ncanal. Believe us, American medical\nhealth services can be horrendously\nexpensive. Although you can take out\ninsurance with British companies,\nyou will find you have to pay up front\n(as much as $400) and claim the\nmoney back once you get home,\nwhich can put a strain on your bud-get. However, with the US company\njust show your certificate/documents\nand the hospital, etc, will be happy to\nclaim the expenses on your behalf.\nFor the first 6 weeks you get on-campus self-catering ac com moda tion, in student halls, for the bargain\nprice of $400. Here each IC student is\npaired up with a UD student who has\nkindly offered to be your roommate,\nand the two share a pretty decent\nsized room. If you end up liking each\nother, well then, that's a bonus. You\nalso get to meet and hang out with\nother regular UD undergraduates,\nwho like yourselves will be doing\nresearch over the summer. The final\ntwo weeks involve home stay( for|\nfree) with an American family. This\nbit is particularly good since you get\ncooked meals and if you are really\nnice the host will let you have parties\nat their house!\nThis summer's five visiting scholars were Stephen Cavanagh (Civil\nUG4), Mohammed Matin (Mech.\nEng. UG4), Zeenab Razak (Materials\nUG4), Kabilan Satyamoorthy\n(Biochem UG3) and Sonia VolnyLuraghi (Physics UG 4). Although\nwe were doing research throughout\nthe day, we were free to organise\nsocial activities for evenings and\nweekends with UD students. We\nspent the 4th of July weekend in\nWashington DC, camping in\nGettysburg (the civil war battlefield)\nwent to baseball games, day trips to\nNew York, New Jersey, Philadelphia.\nBaltimore and the Beach, to name but\na few.\nAnyone interested in applying for\nthe summer '97 scheme can get further information/application forms\nfrom the IC UROP office (Mech Eng\n313C), or ask any one of the five IC UD '96'students, and we would be\nhappy to help The deadline for app li cations is 13th November and inter\nviews will be held on 20th November\n1996. See you then! Good luck!\nTHE WEEKLY POEM supplied by PoetIC\nI'm Scared\nI'm scared that you don't like me.\nThat I'm pushing you away,\nAnd I'm too afraid to ask you,\nBecause I'm scared of what you'll\nsay.\nI'm scared of being lonely,\nAnd I'm scared to look at you,\nIn case you look the other way,\nI'm scared of what I 'll do.\nI'm scared of wanting this too much,\nI'm scared to feel the way I do,\nAnd I'm too afraid to say,\nThat I'm scared of losing you.\nPoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College.\nWorkshops are held every fortnight\non a Monday and other events are\nheld on alternate weeks.

Come November\n5th, Americans must decide who\nserve as our president for the next four\nyears.\nIn the United States, elections are\nmore common than Manchester\nUnited victories (sorry, this was written a few weeks ago). In any given\nyear there are between 120 and 130\nthousand elections. Most of these\nelections are for local school boards,\nbut still this has an overwhelming\neffect on voter turnout. This is basically 60% turnout for most major elections, and 40% for mid-terms, in contrast to the UK, which has a regular\n70% turnout.\nThe point is that Americans don't expect large turnouts, and I don't anticipate that this year will be drastically different.\nThe Democratic candidate is\nincumbent President Bill Clinton.\nClinton is from the small community\nof Hope Arkansas, and prior to the\npresidency held the Governorship of\nArkansas. His vice-presidential nominee is Al Gore of Tennessee.\nBill Clinton - Democrat\nWhat do Franklin Delano Roosevelt\nand John Fitzgerald Kennedy have in\ncommon with William Jefferson\n\"Bill\" Clinton? All three belong to\nAmerica's party of the people, the\nDemocrats.\nMr Clinton served as governor of\nArkansas for eight years before his\naccession to the Presidency. His\ntrack record was excellent. Arkansas\nsaw its job market flourish, and taxes\nhe has realised his dreams. President\nClinton's hometown holds strong\nsymbolic significance as well. He\ntruly is America's true visionary to\nlead us into the next century.\nClinton has worked hard to reform\nour welfare system, stop crime and\nrestore education. He is a young\ncharismatic leader, much like Tony\nBlair. He believes the only way to\ntackle the future is through common\nfall - and the US has been no differ-ent. You have to ask the question, as\nan American, are we better off than\nyou were four years ago? Darn right\nwe are!\nMr Clinton was born in the tiny\ncity of Hope, Arkansas. Through\nsheer hard work and determination\nunity. Mr Clinton knows that if we\nwant to remain a world superpower,\nunity is key.\nSo, come November 5th, people\nwill come out and vote for Bill\nClinton in vast numbers. His works\nspeak for him. Clinton is America's vision for the next millennium.\nA definite down side to Clinton reelection campaign has been the attack\nupon his moral character due to the\nWhitewater investigation. Apparently\nhaving attended Oxford proves that he\nis highly intelligent.\nThe Republican candidate is former\nKansas senator Bob Dole.\nFormerly serving as majority\nleader in the US Senate, he\nresigned in order to devote complete effort to his election cam-pa ign. His running mate is Jack\nKemp, from New York.\nDole\\ClintonVPerot\nsue\nMX\n30i2G K ids h Bill Clinton-^\nBob Dole\nRoss Perot\n5/93\n36%\n25%\n35%\n12/93\n42%\n35%\n16%\nRoss Perot - Reform Party\nDEWAYNE FRAZIER\nDemocrat & Republican - why do\nthese words invoke cynicism in\nAmerica today?\nNearly a decade ago, Ronald\nReagan uttered these immortal words\n\"The worst eleven words in the\nEnglish Language are 'I am from the\ngovernment, and I am here to help\". Why is America so tired of business\nas usual? Because gridlock and status quo doesn't work.\nAmerica is ready for change, and\nRoss Perot and his new Reform Party\nis here. Mr Perot is an accomplished\nmillionaire. He is the embodiment of\nthe American dream - A boy who\nworked hard and made his money\nthrough blood, sweat and tears.\nMr Perot has set an agenda to take\ncare of our $6 000 000 000 000 debt.\nMr Perot made an analogy Ifindvery\neffective. He said that if you have a problem with a car, you don't call a plumber, you call a mechanic. Thus\nif you have problems with the economy you don't call for career politicians, you get an accomplished business man. Mr Perot will be able to\nremedy the problem of this national\nembarrassment that our generation is\nreceiving from our parents.\nRoss Perot is of good moral character and is an upstanding citizen. He\nwould make an excellent leader that\nour generation could look up to. In a legacy of fallen heros, Mr Perot will\nbe a knight in shining armour.\nFELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER NEWS FEATURE 7\nis in your hands.... ELECTION FELIX ASKED OUR AMERICAN STUDENTS FOR THEIR OPINIONS\nMr Dole stands in the public\neye as a citizen of good moral\nvalues. But in today's America,\nthat that is definitely not enough.\nDole is very conservative on\nsocial issues, and looks to reestablish the family, whereas\n>5 1/96\n% 44%\n% 33%\n% 15%\nRESULTS\nIn the end, it proved an easy victory,\nfor Bill Clinton, who became the\nfirst Democrat in fifty years to retain\nthe presidency.\nClinton swept across both the east\nand west coast, taking thirty-two\nstates to Bob Dole's nineteen. The\nelectoral college vote, based on the\nnumber of voters living in each\nstate, was even more dramatically in\nClinton's favour - he took 325 votes\nto Dole's214. However, he still\nfailed to take 50% of the popular\nvote - and with less than half of the\nelectorate turning out, he may face\nquestions over his mandate to gov-ern.\nHe will also face stiff opposition\nfrom the continuing Republican\nmajorities in the Senate and House.\nClinton looks to redefine it. The problem with Mr Dole's campaign lies\nwith his age. Lacking in charisma and\nenergy, he is seen as a boring, stiff-collar businessman.\nThe newly coined \"Reform\" party\nis headed by Ross Perot. The party is\nshowing very low in the polls, and\nlooks not to be a force in US politics,\nas was the case in the 1992 election.\nIn the previous election, President\nClinton captured only about 45% of\nthe votes. If he was to capture under\n50% again this would be a landmark\nin US political history - the first pre s ident in US political history to win\ntwo elections without receiving a popular mandate.\nSadly enough we live in the age of\nmass media. Political figures live\nunder microscopes and their every\nmove is reported. Usually the bad is\nreported to vastly overshadow the\ngood. I really feel that Americans are\ndissatisfied with the upcoming ele c tion. Due to media involvement, most\ncampaigns are largely a battle of mud-slinging. When Americans want\nissues to be debated it never seems to\nhappen. I think the best idea would be\nto shorten election campaigns, to\nmake them similar to the length of\nBritish campaigns. This - I hope -would allow less mud slinging, and\nmore time spent debating.\nThe upcoming election looks to be\nstrongly in favour of Bill Clinton, with\nanalysis ts and polls alike showing a gap of 15 - 20%. Sadly enough, the\ndisgust was summed up for me in a quote from a friend of mine, who,\nwhen asked who they would vote for\nreplied \"I guess for Clinton, as\nimmoral as he is, I guess he's the best\nman for the presidency\".\nLack of values or just reality?\nBob Dole - Republican\nother key\nJENNY REISINGER\nOne of the most important issues in\nthis year's presidential election has\nbeen government spending.\nPresently, the US deficit is around $6\ntrillion. If the deficit isn't taken care\nof in the next ten years, the United\nStates economy could face a complete fallout and Generation X will\nbe left holding the bill.\nBob Dole and\nRepublicans have\npresented several\nproposals that\nwould help to\nreduce the deficit\nand balance the\nbudget in the next\nseven years. Each\nproposal was vetoed\nby Bill Clinton who\nhas continued to\nspend taxpayers'\nmoney.\nBill Clinton\nincreased the taxes\nfor the rich in the\ncountry. Unfortunately, that\ntax increase affected less than 5% of the United States\npopulation, hardly enough to make a difference in the country.\nBob Dole has presented a proposal\nwhich will cut taxes over the next\nseveral years and, at the same time,\ncut the budget deficit, by cutting\nenough government spending,\nThere are two distinct areas concerning money that will need to be\nlooked at in the future if the government wants to get the budget and the\ndeficit under control. First, the\nRepublicans want to reform Social\nSecurity. After World War II, there\nwere a huge number of births in the\nUnited States, most of whom will all\nbe retiring around the same time. The\nsystem will not be able to handle the\ngreat number of retirees and\nGeneration X will have to pay the\nextra money. Bill Clinton and the\nDemocrats have dragged their feet .\nThe Republicans, however, have\nsuggested phasing out the Social\nSecurity System without harming\nthose who have put money into the\nsystem.\nSecondly, Bill Clinton has\npromised welfare reform. Bill\nClinton finally signed a welfare\nreform bill in the last six months. The\nwelfare reform bill was written by\nRepublicans.\nBill Clinton may be young and\nBob Dole an old man but when it\ncomes to policies affecting the young\npeople of the United States, Bill\nClinton acts as if he could care less\nabout our genera-tion.\nSure, some say\nBob Dole is old\nfashioned. Bob\nDole is old fashioned in the sense\nj f that he does what he\n\u2022 says he will do. He\nrealises there are\nproblems in the\ncountry and instead\nof waiting for\nsomeone to fix\nthem, he fixes\nthem. Bill Clinton\nhas done nothing to\nmake the country I will inherit better.\nThe future for America will not be\na bright one if things don't start to\nchange now. Under Clinton, the only\nchanges that have been made have\nbeen made by the Republicans in\nCongress. Perhaps its time to put the\nRepublicans in the White House and\nsee what happens. After all, things\ncan only get better.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER NEWS FEATURES 5\nThe phenomenon known as\nAldwych\nAmidst the confusion surrounding the imminent HE teachers' strike (FELIX\n1067) Simon Wistow courts controversy once again by investigating.\nYou may or may not have heard of\nthe Russell group. For those of you\nthat have; well done for keeping\nabreast of current affairs particularly\nthose that involve dear old IC, for\nthose of you that don't; here is a short synopsis\nHalf way through 1994 Sir Eric\nAsh (ex Rector of IC and now the\nChief Executive of the Student\nLoans Company) met up in The\nRussell Hotel (hence the name, neat\nhuh) with representatives from five\nother Universities namely Oxford,\nCambridge, Warwick and UCL, to\ndiscuss ideas. These included breaking away from national pay bargaining so that they can offer higher\nsalaries to attract top staff and\nopposing Government plans to share\nout limited research funding more\nevenly with polytechnics (that policy\nfailed by the way). Other\nUniversities were fearful that the\nRussell group would break away to\nform a superleague that would attract\nthe best students and the most lucrative research contracts and the students were worried that all this talk\nabout top-up fees would mean that\nonly the rich could afford to go to the\ntop Unis. The words 'Ivy League'\nwere bandied around and nobody\nreally knew what was going on. The\nnumbers in the group rose and,\namongst others, the London School\nof Economics, Manchester,\nBirmingham and Edinburgh\nUniversities joined. Then later in\n1994 the LSE Students' Union initiated what it called the Aldwych\nGroup to protect students' interests.\nThey were set up as non-exclusive\ngroup of Student Unions to lobby the\nelitist movement in Higher\nEducation (i.e. the Russell group).\nThis is were we rejoin the story\nA couple of Thursdays (the 24th) ago the Aldwych Group held a meeting at the University of\nSheffield Students' Union. Amongst\nthe things discussed was a formal is a tion of the Terms of Reference\n(which I can't get a copy of because\nour Student Union hasn't got it\ndespite the fact that the meeting was\ntwo weeks ago), the so called\n'Event' at Huddersfield university\nand the forthcoming 'National\nShutdown' (the strike to you and\nme).\nThe 'Event' is apparently a rally/meeting which, I 've heard\nthrough the grapevine, smells suspiciously like a badly camouflaged\nCampaign for Free Education do.\nThe members of the Group decided\nthat they would not go although the\nchair did give them permission to\nattend if they wanted to.\nIt was also decided that during the\nstrike (called for the 19th by the way,\nif you want to organise something)\nthe ICU Staff would not be allowed\nto go on strike because, due to the\nfact that although they are paid by\nthe College they are employed by the\nUnion, this would be secondary\naction.\nScanning through my notes I can\nalso see that there is going to be an\nEmergency budget meeting on\nMonday the 2nd of December at\nLSE to discuss any actions they\nmight have for action around the\ntime of the Budget and, on a slightly\nmore interesting (but not much)\nnote, a pre-Budget rally outside the\nRussell hotel and a post-Budget\npress conference.\nIt was decided that the Aldwych\nGroup to go public and, to this\nextent, are planning to put a full page\nad in TTie Guardian which will cost\nsomewhere in the region of four and\na half grand (about \u00a3288 for each of\nthe 26 constituent Unions) although\nthis does not include spell checking\n(that was a joke by the way).\nAnd that was about it really for the\nagenda. However it was revealed\nwhich Universities were going to\ncharge top-up fees next year. Read\non and thank god that you chose to\ncome here. These universities are:\nBirmingham, UMIST, Manchester,\nKeele and Warwick. Also, LSE has\ndecided that it will instigate a policy\nof top ups, though just not at the\nmoment.\nSo it appears that the age of elitism is upon us once again. How soon\nbefore we end up with a system like\nthat circa 1900 when only the rich\ncould afford to get a decent e duca tion? Logically this can only\ndecrease the value of our degrees\nand hasten a revival of the old-boys\nnetwork. It will also mean added\npressure in a not particularly friendly job market where it is already a necessity to have a degree to get a half way decent job. It will be interesting to see what the Aldwych\ngroup does to prevent this; whether it\nwill lobby the participants to prevent\nit or sit back and indulge in some\nmilitant tub bashing.\nMystique of the sandwich maker's craft revealed\nJACKIE S KEA TE An interesting letter appeared in\nFelix last week. No, I'm not talking\nabout the numerous responses about\nactivities cards. Nor am I concerned\nwith the perfunctory missive from\nMr Caldwell. I mean the one that\nbegins with the wise words \"I would\nlike to bring to the attention of IC students the fact that the sandwiches\nsold in QT are of both poorer quality\nand higher price than the sandwiches\nsold outside the college.\"\nNot that this is big news to the\naverage student. Avocado, chicken\nand bacon sandwiches such as those\nsold in QT are regarded as a little bit\npon cy. After all, everyone knows that\nreal students live exclusively off cig-are tte s, alcohol, chocolate, and the\noccasional \u00a31 curry. Only the true\ngourmets amongst them can be seen\nambling down towards a certain shop\nalong Gloucester Road after 4.00pm. But this letter is interesting never the less. It goes to highlight the very special place that the lunchtime sandwich has in the hearts and stomachs\nof the British people. Only a cultural\nheathen could stand resolutely by the\nunenlightened opinion that sandwiches are always stale, sticky, plastic ky and overpriced. The price\nreflects the quality, and, as any true\nconnoisseur knows, the staleness,\nstickiness and plastic ness can only\nadd to the experience. Worth a mention are the ones with an inch-thick\nliquid filling... bite into one, and the\ncontents end up on the opposite wall.\nIt is also good if you find something\nthat shouldn't be there when you take\nthe first mouthful...top marks for\nwasps, needles, and dead rodents.\nLower down the scale, points can be\nawarded for toenails, pubic hairs, and\nany unidentified bits of metal.\nThe fact that these are blatantly\ncheap substitutes for a proper filling\nleads me to wonder about just how\nmuch someone can get away with\ncharging for two boring slices of\nbread, mayonnaise, and cold meat.\nBearing in mind that a whole loaf of\nbread costs about 40p, making a slice\ncost roughly 4p at most, and that fillings like cheese, ham, and lettuce can\nbe brought cheaply, implies that\neither only the finest ingredients, lovingly hand-prepared by highly-skilled sandwich-making craftsmen\ncan ever be used, or that there is a silently-acknowledged agreement by\nprofit-hungry caterers to fix prices at\nan artificially high level. Having said\nthat, however, College doesn't actually make a lot of money from cater-ing, so maybe there is something else\ngoing on here. Maybe it's the aforementioned lovely plastic wrappings\nthat are costing a phenomenal\namount. Maybe buying lunch is even\nturning into a form of gambling, and\nthat there are some lucky people out\nthere who bite into their midday\nsandwich to discover a few pound\ncoins along with a slice of ham and a few elderly lettuce leaves. If so, I 'll\nkeep visiting the JCR...one day, it\ncould be me...\n\n"

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER\nEEL IX SPORT\nIC Rugby - Comeback Kids leave it\nslightly too late\nWILLIAM BEAUMONT FELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT\nEgged on by a large vocal crowd, IC\nnearly stole a victory from under the\nnoses of Royal Holloway. Just as in\nall the previous matches IC's superior fitness was clearly evident and\nonce again the honour of the final\nscore was ours. What's more is that\nthis last 20 mins of barnstorming\nplay was into a devilish wind which\nwould have proved a serious test to\nany sides resolve. What is called for\nnow is for the effort shown in the last\nquarter to be sustained for the entire\nmatch - then the opposition will surely suffer. Plus points from the game\nwere improvements in the line out and defence.\nA healthy fixture list sees IC\nembarking on a concentrated period\nof rugby, with forays into the\nGutteridge League and Cup. Next\nweek IC take on the medics of Royal\nFree, and on November 16th we play\nthe old boys at Harlington.\nHonour was bestowed on the club\nwhen Jack Pearl and Ollie Lyttleton\nwere selected for the ULU squad.\nCongratulations all.\nSeconds take on thirds in IC derby\nThe points were quick to flow. After\nfive minutes, the threes capitalised\non a twos breakdown and Tom completed a15 man effort to overturn\ntwos possession, scoring in the cor-ner. A tad aggravated, the twos\nbegan a tough fight against hum ilia tion. For the first-half, against the\nwind little progression poured forth,\nand the thirds showed strength and\nhonourable work. Just before halftime a little luck was beset upon the\nseconds, with Kolone the ever reliable winger rectifying the balance.\nThe second half was slightly more\ndisciplined, with an end to end battle\nfor forty minutes. The only breakthrough came from The Viking, his\nfirst for IC. After a tremendous roar\nand an Icelandic muttering the play\npicked up to the standard expected of\nthe seconds.\nIn summary, the final score was\n10-5. The thirds played superbly, and\nthe final score was unrepresentative\nof their effort.\nFootball fourths pick up the pieces\nAfter last weeks disastrous Saturday,\nIC Fourths were happy to draw three\na piece, despite leading by two goals\nagainst a UCL team one division\nhigher than themselves, and only\ngoal keeping errors and defensive\nblunders cost the team a vital three\npoints which would have confirmed\nthe team's position in the next round\nof the National Cup.\nIn the second game, also against a UCL side a league game against the\nUCL Fifths, IC diss a point ingly drew\none-one, again after surrendering the\nlead. An off-form, under-strength\nteam played poorly in the first-half,\nthough as many chances were wasted in the second-half by our main\nstrikers it must be seen as two points\nlost rather than one point gained.\nBoth games were very scrappy,\nwith Ken making many tackles\nwhich would not have been out of\nplace on a rugby field. He was lucky\nnot to have his name taken by the ref-eree, to add to that of the keeper.\nSteve almost had an early bath for\nretaliation, after being assaulted by\nthe right winger, but Sion Pale\ninflamed the situation further, by\nhaving a spat with a full-back who\nwas built like a brick latrine, though\nhe withdrew prematurely from the\nposition, after only fifteen seconds.\nThankfully, there was Darren,\nChris and Dimitri on Wednesday,\nand Pistol (never fires a blank) Pete\non Saturday to score the goals and\nprotect the innocent. Only a slightly\ncontroversial match-report this time,\nso roll on Wednesday....\nPromising start\nfor volleyball\nThis week of BUSA volleyball was\na first for the newly formed female\nteam of volleyball in IC. It implied a \"do-what-we-can\" attitude against a strong and well balanced side from\nUCL. But they take pride in their\ndisplay; it was never over for UCL\nleading for a harsh score line in the\nsecond set. It ended up 15/11 15/3 -hopefully they can do better in the\naway match to be played in a fort-night.\nFor the boys, it was a bit easier; a two set to nil victory was well\ndeserved after a close defeat last\nweek. An impressive display in the\nattack (to quote the ref, \"You played\nreally well\") made it really difficult\nfor UCL to respond. The whistle\nblew with the score 15/11 15/9 -well done IC. Just one question\nremained; how was it that in four\nteams, out of four ty players, there\nwas only one Englishman, and he\nwent to the French Lycee?\nWinners from\nstart to finish\nWhat can I say? We were amazing,\nQMW were a quality team, but no\nmatch for the all conquering sec-on ds. The first goal, by Rich Brunt,\nresulted from the usual IC pressure\nat the beginning of the game. IC\npressed for a second goal, but it\nwouldn't come. QMW finally got\ntheir act together towards the end of\nthe half. Luckily, their finish was\nappalling.\nThe second-half started with even\nmore IC pressure, resulting in a knock in for Rich. The game then\nconfined itself to the QMW half, as\nIC became very dominant as the\nopposition began to decompose.\nAfter a few goal saving moves by\nthe defence, IC again found their\nkiller touch as Goran pile drive d the\nball into the back of the net. Bill did\nhis customary clumsy tackle, flooring an opponent. But IC were so\nsuperior that QMW seemed to be\nplaying like a bunch of art students.\nRESULTS\nRUGBY I C1ST2010 ROYAL HOLLOWAY IC2 ND105I C3R DR SM3612 EALING POLICE FOOTBALL IC4 TH33 UCL4 TH IC4 TH11 UCL5 TH FENCING IC WOMEN126 UCL VOLLEYBALL IC WOMEN02 UCL IC MEN20 UCL HOCKEY IC2 ND30 Q MW2 N DIC LADIES1 ST30 UCL IC LADIES2 ND07 UCL "

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER\nNHS funding crisis passes St Mary's by\nMARIA IOANNOU\nIt looks set to be a hard winter for the\nNational Health Service, with 36\nTrust Hospitals in the red despite a statutory responsibility to break\neven. However, unlike several other\nLondon Trusts, St Mary's Hospital\nhas carried over a surplus for the\nyear.\nRunning up a total budget overspend of \u00a334 million in the 1994-95\nfinancial year, the individual trusts\nare under far more pressure than the\nhealth authorities to prevent such\ndeficits. The health authorities are\nexpected to be \u00a3118 million over\ntheir budget, with 63 of 99 having a deficit.\nThe Trust Hospitals who are suffering financial difficulties include\nThe Royal National Orthopaedic\n(\u00a33.4m), Royal United Hospital,\nBath (\u00a32.5m), Greenwich, South\nLondon (\u00a32.8m), the Royal National\nEar, Nose and Throat Hospital\n(\u00a3826,000) and Swindon and\nMalborough (\u00a3500,000).\nThese deficits in Trust Hospitals\nmay give rise to ward closures, operation cancellations, staff shortages\nand longer waiting lists, with the hospitals trying desperately to wipe out\ntheir debts.\nStephen Dorrell, Secretary of State\nfor Health, made a bid for an additional \u00a31.5 billion for the NHS budget at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday\nand came out with an extra \u00a31.3 bil-lion. The easy benevolence of this\nmay be slightly undermined by the\nfact that John Major has recently\nrenewed the Conservative manifesto\ncommitment to spend more, in real\nterms, on the NHS every year. This is\ndespite government attempts to cut\nthe \u00a3286.2bn public spending bill by\n\u00a34 billion to make way for tax cuts\non the Budget on the 26th of\nNovember.\nSt Mary's Hospital Healthcare\nTrust has fortunately managed to\nstay within its budget limitations this\nyear, whilst still providing an excellent service. However, sources at St\nMary's could not confirm for how\nmuch longer the Trust's finances\nwould stay in the black; despite the\nextra money a qui red by the Health\nSecretary the NHS still faces a shortage of ad qu ate funding.\nWith your intelligence,\nshouldn't you be working with ours?\nReuters is a world-class organisation, supplying critical, real-time\ninformation to the financial services industry and to the major\nfinancial centres around the world.\nPerhaps you haven't considered us as a career option.

Sir Ron requests l x ne7 readies\nIn this issue of\n#L\\ Something for the\nWeekend the Spice\nGirls and Boyzone\nKENT YIP\nIn his speech on Commemoration\nDay, the Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, focused once again on the\nlack of funding in Higher Education.\nIn particular, he pointed out hardship\nfaced by staff whose earnings have\nbeen falling in real terms for over a decade, and expressed his fear that\nthe quality of education was being\nthreatened, even at the best institutions. Figures published by the Times\nHigher Education Supplement gave a mixed picture to the financial scene\nat Imperial College. IC has always\nrelied heavily upon funds from\nindustry, commerce and public cor-p orations. Last year was no exception\nwith an income of \u00a36,216,000\nobtained from those sectors, ranking\nIC third overall, just below\nCambridge.\nSome people expressed concern\nthat Cranfield University, which\ntopped the table, made most of their\nmoney in areas specialised in by IC,\nnamely aeronautical engineering,\nmaterials and biotechnology. Equally\nworrying was that despite the enormous amount of research carried out\nGetting dressed up.

The Rector's recent trip to Hong\nKong, where he met up with IC\nalumni, had been described as \"positive\" by the PR officer, Lynda\nDavies, and the College hoped more\nsupport would come from that front\nin the future.\nDue to the comparatively small\nnumber of students accommodated in\nhalls of residence, the College\nreceived only \u00a310 million in renting\nrooms and catering, compared to several times this for other institutions.\nThe shortage of space also limited\nthe income that could be generated\nfrom conferences. However, with the\naddition of the new BMS building on\nthe campus, it was expected that the\nsituation would improve.\nDrawing attention to the ache ive ment s of the College's students, particularly the success enjoyed by\nImperial College Boat Club this summer at the Henley Regatta, Sir Ron\nurged graduates to contribute enthusiastically to the funding for the\nrefurbishment and extension of the\nboat house.\" I hope that anyone who\nfeels able to help will not feel hesitant about letting me know.\"\nTo boycott or not to boycott...\nNEWS TEAM On Tuesday, Imperial College Union\nCouncil backed away from advocating an all out boycott of the planned\nnew bookstore. A suggestion that IC\nstudents should avoid any bookstore\nthat was not run by their Student's Union was brushed aside, with one\nsabbatical suggesting that the matter\nshould not even be debated.\nThe Council did however resolve\nto seek \"reparations\" if the new\nbookstore, which will replace the\ncurrent Walkway sited outlet, is run\nby an external organisation. The\nmeeting also decided that the Union\nshould oppose \"top-up fees\", but\nonly in such a way as not to an tag on is e College administration.\nVacant positions on Council were\nalso open for nominations, with the\nTreasurer of the Athletics Clubs\nCommittee being elected in his\nabsence as a postgraduate member.\nThe post of Welfare Officer remains\nunfilled despite attempts to find a candidate.\nThe Union's Disciplinary and\nHealth and Safety policies received\ncontinued on page 2\nInside\nINTRUDERS IN HALLS\nSecurity measures have been stepped\nup after men entered Holbein Hall,\nwatched by several scared students\nfrom a kitchen, and escaped before\nthey could be apprehended.
