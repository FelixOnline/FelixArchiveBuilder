    "content": "22\nIC Radio 19 October 1998\nThe Future's Bright, the Future's Pink?\nNo-one at Imperial will need the stats\nfrom a college census to work out that\nImperial isn't exactly brimming with girls.\nAnd why should it be - it's a college of sci-en ce, technology and medicine - the\nsolid territory of gangly beard y types who\nwear rock T shirts to interviews. But\nbefore the more touchy of Imperial's males start moaning, spare a thought for\nthe rarer sex. With the obstacles that\nexist, it's no wonder there are so few\nwomen in science and engineering.\nNext week, on Imperial College Radio, I 'll\nbe looking at what is being done to\nredress the balance. That's in the News\nShow, from 7-8pm on 999kHz AM.\nWhen it comes to working in acad-emi a, success is all about papers published and funding won. Yet according\nto research published last year in top\nscience journal, Nature, women have to\nbe far more productive than men to\nstand any chance of reaching the top.\nThe study, which looked at the success\nof grant applications to the Swedish Medical Research Council, found that women\nhad to be 2.5 times better, in terms of\ncitations and numbers of papers pub-li shed, to have the same chance of winning a grant as their male colleagues.\nThe reasons for such a horrendous\ndisparity are open to speculation, but\nundoubtedly plain sexism plays a role.\nProfessor Susan Greefleld, who holds a Chair at Oxford University and has\nrecently been appointed as the first\nwoman Director of the Royal Institution,\nwas championing the cause of women\nin science at the recent Labour Party\nconference. \"What I found perhaps\nencapsulated the mood of the limes,\"\nshe said, \" was not only the enthusiasm\nthe people on the floor had for women\nin science, but afterwards I was sitting\nnext to a delegate, who'll remain name-less, over dinner and he said, 'The problem with you clever women is you scare\nme.' And I think that, more than anything\nsums up the nebulous problem.\"\nSexism aside, there are inherent\naspects of academic life that have traditionally hindered women in their careers.\nAnyone who takes time off to start a family will find themselves severely disadvantaged when they return, says Professor Greenfield. \"Science research is\none of the very few careers, unlike medicine or spot-welding or whatever, where\nif you don't work for two years it's very\nhard to return at a senior level because\nif you don't publish you're dead.\" The\nresult is that more and more young\nwomen are leaving science altogether as\nsoon as they finish their degrees, and\nmore end up in teaching than in any\nother single profession.\nThe huge imbalance of sexes in science and engineering has been ringing\nalarm bells for some time and earlier\nthis month, AWiSL, the Association for\nWomen in Science and Lngineering,\nlaunched a website to provide information for women interested in academic\nor industrial careers in science and\nrelated fields. President of the London\nbranch of AWiSL is Imperial's own Professor Julia Higgins. \"There's an AWiSL\nbranch at Imperial and it's a friendly way\nof getting to know other people in the\ncollege, other women at various levels\nand it works as a good network. I would\nsuggest, at the very least, getting in\ntouch on email.\"\nThe AWiSL website can be found at\nwww.a wise. org and at Imperial, Dr Alison\nPayne, Chair of the London branch can\nbe contacted at a. j. payne@ic.ac.uk.

    "content": "10 Feature 19 October 1998\nAn Alternative to airstrikes? Jacob Stringer investigates the US bombing of Sudan and\nasks: Do the ends really justify the means?\nIn August of this year the US, with the full\nsupport of Mr Tony Blair and various\nother Western governments, launched\nair strikes against supposed terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. It appears\nthat the attacks In Afghanistan may have\nbeen justified but the attack on Khartoum\nneeds to be looked at more closely. At\nthe time the only really vocal protesters against this attack were\nSudan and Pakistan, who were\nsummarily dismissed by the\npress as being too prejudiced for\ntheir opinions to be\nof any value. J \u00a3\nSix weeks ,\nhave passed\nsince the bom tings, and the sit\nu ation can\nlooked at more <\nti vc ly. The US launched an\nunprovoked attack on a weaker country, without\neven talking to the country\nfirst, without discussing it\nin the UN, without having any solid evidence to show that the supposed offenders were guilty of any crime. The attack\nwas on a civilian target, where it was\nknown that the majority of people were\ninnocent and had no way of defending\nthemselves. There is still no evidence to\njustify the attack.\nI believe we generally call such an attack The CHITieS OF the g sad news for you. America does not\nhave the good of the world at heart; the\nAmerican government has only re-ele c tion concerns at heart (Yes, even in\nNorthern Ireland, though they m, have done some good) and it\nis time to stop pretending\notherwise.\nThe\nmain reasons the US is\nso hated in the\nidle East are the\nu ed military presence in Saudi Arabia and\nthe political, financial and military support of Israel. About the\nformer I know little, but this summer I visited Israel and the West Bank. I was there for a matter of weeks only, but\nhad time to reach some pretty strong\nconclusions. The Israeli governmental\npolicies condone and allow human rights\nabuses to an extent which would be\ncondemned universally if it were not for\nthe support provided by the US. The\ninstitutional is ed discrimination against\nPalestinians has been described by Rev.\nDesmond Tutu as 'worse than apartheid'.\nThe crimes of the Israeli\nover nm cnt include\nIsraeli _\ninclude theft of\neither a declaration of\nwar or terrorism. It wasn't the first. Thank you Tony\nfor showing your strength\nby supporting such\nheroes. Well done, we land and hOI TieS salute your noble stand\nagainst terrorism, rule Britannia and kiss\nClintons butt.\nNow, these air strikes were in retaliation for the bombing of US embassies.\nWhy would anyone want to do that?\nSurely America is the moral pillar of the\nwestern world, is our mentor and guide\nand wishes us no harm? Why would anyone want to bomb them? I have some\ntheft of land and homes,\nOVemment demolition of inhabited\nhouses, torture of pris-on ers, imprisonments\nwithout trial, settling of\noccupied territories, forbidding people to travel\nfreely within their own country and,\nrecently, lack of real interest in the peace\nprocess. These policies arc not new and\narc not secret. The Israeli government,\ndespite repeated condemnation by the\nUN and human rights organisations,\nhave even intensified policies such as\nhome demolition since the so-called\npeace process began. They have no\nintention in the near future of being any\nmore accommodating to the land's indigenous population. Israel is a country that should not be supported by any country that\npurports to protect freedom,\ndemocracy and human rights,\nn stead it deserves the same treatment meted out to South Africa during\nthe Apartheid years. There is no excuse\nfor the US, Britain or anyone else to\nmaintain friendships with it.\nSo the alternative to air strikes for the\nUS? The condemnation of the state of\nIsrael for its appa ling and continuing\nrecord of human rights abuses. At this\npoint the best thing for the US to do\nwould be to end all its activities in the\nMiddle East and go home to try and sort\nout who they should be supporting and\nwho they should not be. Britain too\nneeds to take a very serious look at its\npolicies in the Middle East, and think\nvery carefully about what history will say\nabout it, before it makes any further\nmoves.\nJust for the record, I do not support\nthe activities of Palestinian terrorists, but\nafter spending time with Palestinians in\nthe West Bank I began to sym pathis e with them and began to understand why\nthe terrorists do what they do.\nThe ArteMagazine of Imperial College Needs an editor\nInterested?\nThensignup on the board opposite Unionreception, or contact David Roberts at dj vr@ ic.ac.uk\nAllcandidates need atleast ten second ers, Electionswilltake\nplace at 6pm on Monday, October 26th inthe Felix Office.\n\n"

Designed by Sir Norman Foster & Partners, the \u00a365m,22,000 square metre building will house 2000\nBio-Medical Sciences (BMS) staff and\nstudents.\nThe visit comes as part of a royal\ntour of South Kensington including an\nexhibition at the Royal College of Art and\nthe final unveiling of the refurbished\nAlbert Memorial.\nWhile in the building Her Majesty\nwill be shown examples of current\nresearch including work on cancer, transplant immune responses, and biological\nrhythms.\nThe number of non-BMS students\nallowed into the building has been very\nlimited, but there will be an opportunity\nfor everyone to see Her Majesty as she\narrives and departs along Imperial College Road at around 6.00p.m. and\n7.00p.m. respectively. It will also be possible to attend the re-opening of the\nAlbert Memorial (in Hyde Park) at\n7.45p.m. which will close with son-et-lumi ere celebrations.\nStudents and staff should note that\na car-parking ban will be enforced along\nthe entire Imperial College Road (in clu d ing outside Civil Engineering and Chemistry) from 6pm on Tuesday until 11pm Wednesday. This ban includes motorcycles and bicycles - any found on\nWednesday morning will be removed.\nCharing Cross:\nMassive Loss\nAs reported in Felix\n1120, Charing Cross\nand Westminster Medical School's farewell Summer Ball has\nended with a massive financial loss, with\nestimates ranging from \u00a340,000 to\n\u00a355,000 now seeming conservative as\nthe investigation into the somewhat\nsuspect book-keeping continues.\nA special committee was set up to\norganise the ball consisting of representatives from College, CXWMS Alumni\ncommittee, IC Alumni committee and\nthe CXWMS student union, not just\nCXWMSU as was previously incorrectly\nreported. The ball cost in the region of\n\u00a385,000, including \u00a328,000 spent hiring\nthe largest marquee in the country,\n\u00a37,000 on champagne and \u00a33,000 on\nfireworks (the resulting display being\ndescribed as \"bloody excellent\").\nThe event, held at Cobham, was to\nbe the final send-off before the complete merger with IC. The financial problems appear to have largely arisen from\nmany of the tickets allocated to CXWMS\nalumni not being sold and the non-material is ation of promised sponsorship\nmonies. Student tickets were at a sub-By Andrew Brown sidi sed \u00a345, with non-students paying\napproximately \u00a375.\nHowever, few of the 400 tickets allocated to non-students were sold, and\nsome of them were made available to\nstudents at the reduced price, further\ncompounding the loss.\nThe situation worsened when, at\nthe end of the evening after all of the\nmedics had gone home, the event's bar\ntakings were \"un accounted for\". Cash\nof the order \u00a310,000- \u00a314 000 was taken\nand is yet to be recovered, with the bar\nmanager on the night seemingly the\nprime suspect. John Green, who was in\ncharge of 'mopping up' the day's debris,\nsaid that the matter was \"still under\ninvestigation\" but refused to comment\nfurther while David Hellard, ICU pre si dent, said that he \"cannot confirm or\ndeny\" these reports.\nSeveral things remain unclear: What\nhappened to the bar takings, what is the\ntotal amount lost (the sums are still\nbeing done) and, perhaps most importantly, who is going to pick up the bill?\nCaldwell, Caldwell, Why does your Garden Grow?\nFor those of you who did not read the\narticle last week about the intention to\nplant flowers at IC, here is a little back-ground. The estates division is in the\nprocess of planting a large flower bed\nBy Tony Of ori adjacent to the Waterstonc's bookshop\non Imperial College Road, and in addition\nto this, several trees will be introduced at\nthe front of the new BMS building. The\ntotal cost of this project has been c sli issue 1122\n19 October 1998\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nPhotographic Editor: William Lorenz\nMusic Editor: Jason Ramanathan\nNews Editors: Andy Ofori and Joel\nLewis\nFilm Editor: David Roberts\nGames Editor: Gary Smith\nArts Editor: Helena Cochemc\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nmated at \u00a3110,000. This figure stands to\ngrow by \u00a350,000 per annum since the\ncollege will lose revenue from the parking spaces sacrificed. Amidst rumours\nthat this expenditure is solely for the\nQueen's visit on the 21 October, the project goes ahead undeterred.\nAs funds from the college are ultimately intended to improve the college\nfor the students and lectures alike, their\nopinions were sought. A small survey\nhighlighted the fact that an overwhelming majority of the students\nthought that the idea was \"pointless\" and\n\"a waste of money\". \"You only need to\nlook along Imperial College Road to sec\nthat on this part of the campus more\n[trees] aren't necessary\" was one\nresponse. The lecturers on the whole displayed a more cautious opinion saying\nthat in principle the idea is a good one\nbut questioning the just if i ability of the\nexpense. There may be some people\nthat think that this venture is sensible but\nFelix was unable to find any.\nUnable to find someone in the first\nsurvey who wholly believed that the\nidea was a good one, Felix approached\nas many random people as possible\nwith the sole intention of finding a believer, but to no avail. Some judged\nthe idea of planting more shrubbery\naround college as a good one but none\nthought that \u00a3110,000 was a reasonable\nfigure for it. ICU and RCSU were consulted but neither were prepared to\nexpress an opinion. Undeterred, Felix\npursued the investigation to the col-leg e's estates department where people\nare supposed to be able to financially\njustify any building projects undertaken\nby the college. They denied any knowledge of the exact price for the floral\nenhancement, and when asked hypo-thc tlc ally: \"If the entire project did cost\n\u00a3110,000, would you consider it reasonable given the magnitude of shrubbery that is going to be planted?\". The\nunanimous response was \"no\"...followed\nby the word \"comment\".\ne lix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at MCP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16 - 16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nTelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

    "content": "19 October 1998\nElizabeth * \u2022 ' \u2022 %\nStarring : Cate Blanchett, Christopher Ecclestone, Geoffrey Rush,\nDirector: Shekhar Kapur\nOddly, for a film which has seen\nits entire marketing drive\nfocused on a \"revolutionary\"\nre-working of history, Elizabeth comes\nacross as surprisingly clich e. Watch\nRichard Attenborough as the ford\nChamberlain: short, dumpy, red faced\nand permanently confused. Joesph\nfiennes, our romantic lead is the classical Elizabethan effeminate fop. And\nChristopher Ecclestone is pointy bearded evil incarnate. Indeed, Elizabeth herself is straight out of my school text\nbook. OK, so she may not have been\nthe virgin queen that history remembers, but, to be honest, that's only\ngoing to shock the odd half-dead\nOxford don.\nNonetheless, its still a well, if una d venturous, piece of movie-making,\nlargely due to some fine performances\nfrom it's stars. Ecclestone turns in another\nsterling performance, oozing devious\ncharm (albeit with a slight hint of Dick\nDastardly) as he plots to overthrow the\nyoung queen and restore Catholicism to\nEngland, whilst Rush lurks in shadows\nwith the kind of looming intensity that\nany royal protector worth his salt requires.\nLord Robert Dudley, renowned historically for being subtle as a brick\nI low ever, it's Blanchett's central performance that stops Elizabeth slipping off\ninto utter parody. She perfectly captures\nthe image of a young, innocent girl,\nthrown unexpectedly into power. Constantly battling against the suppressing\nwill of her advisors, she is forced to\nrapidly mature, to decide her own life,\nand, above all, find out who she can\nreally trust.\nDirector Kapur, working outside his\nnative India for the first time, holds the\nwhole thing together very well, and hints\nat a promising future career. Some nice\ntouches of cinematography (filming\nthrough drapes, mirrors and so forth)\nhelp to make what might otherwise be\nvery predictable scenes come alive. Plus,\nhis avoidance of the obvious directorial\ntraps - lots of swashbuckling, bodice ripping and the like - makes a refreshing\nchange. Instead, he chooses to centre\nthe film on Blanchettt's loss of innocence, and her progression from confused child to the stern, aloof leader that\nhistory remembers.\nEventually, however, it's the script\nand plot that lets Elizabeth down. It's simply too obvious, too text-book to be\nbelievable - think Jane Austen with Elizabethan costumes. Which would be OK\nif that's what you were expecting and if\nthat's what the makers were trying to\nachieve - but they seemed to be aiming\nfor so much more. The genuine feel of\nwhat life was like at the turn of the seventeenth century is missing, and consequently there's no sense of wonder, no\nsense of be liev ability in what appears on\nthe screen. And as a result we're left with\na nice story, but nothing more.\nA solid cast, good direction and the\nwords \"Channel Four Films Present\" could\n(and should) have combined to produce\nso much more. A real missed opportunity. Q Dave\nActua Tennis * * \u2022 * Buggy \u2022 * \u2022\nTennis, hmm strawberries, cream, warm\nsunny afternoons. Computer tennis: tin-nie s of beer, ice cream and cold, wet,\nautumnal afternoons. Fortunately I did-n't mind the weather outside, as I was\ntoo involved in trying to win a tournament on the clay courts. Actua - the UK's answer to the EA sport game empire\nhave managed to produce a complete\nsmash of a game. They've lobbed the\nopposition into the sidelines and (game-set-and) matched the best sports games\nout there (ok I 'll stop the tennis puns\nhere).\nSo what makes it such a good\ngame? Is it the simplicity of the controls?\nControls that allow the beginner to put\na serve in after a few attempts and return\nthe ball after a few more, yet allow you\nto perform point winning strokes when\nyou sort out the positioning and timing\nof the stroke. Is it the ability to customise\nyour player from being a6'1\" heavily\nbuilt female 120+ mph serve machine\n(well almost) to a5' lightly built nymph,\nwearing shades and black shorts? Is it the\nfact that a British player can make the\nfinal of what is obviously Wimbledon\nand have a decent chance of winning?\nActually it's all these. If you just add on\nthe motion captured players, the eye\ncandy of the scoreboards in the background that change even if they are\nonly visible for a fraction of a second and\nyou have an almost complete tennis\ngame.\nNotice the almost bit. I realise this\nsounds like I'ms lagging off consoles\nagain but the little voice bits always\nseemed staccato, and generally made\nthe umpire sound like a6 year old.\n\"Player One\"...wait wait wait...\n\"won\"...wait wait., \"by\". Ok you've got\nthe idea. I lope fully the PC version coupled with a decent 3D card will have an\numpire with an adult reading age, and\nball boys and girls slightly wider than a piece of paper. But I'm protesting too\nmuch about the eye and ear candy. If\nyou've got a hankering to give pistol\nPete a damn good whipping, watch\nAnna smash a few balls or generally like\ntennis or sport games then go and buy\nit, rent it, just do it (I lied about the\npuns). O Magpie\nEveryone's complaint, about Playstation\ngames these days seem to be with the\nquality, and unfortunately Buggy falls\ninto the category of nice idea, poor\nimplementation. Buggy is based on that\nfavourite adolescent pastime - remote\ncontrol car racing. The game play is centred on racing against other cars or\nagainst the clock; unlocking hidden\ntracks; and mix'n 'matching powers in\nthe right sequence to obtain special driving modes. Such power-ups as 'speed\nup' and 'mean ie mode', which enables\nyou to barge you way through the pack,\nalso help to win races.\nIn the beginning Buggy is not very\nchallenging, but with each progression\nyou start to see how mixing and matching the power ups gives you the edge\nover your opponents. There is a slight\nincentive to find these enhancements, as\nsome combinations have some interesting consequences, but concentrating on this usually means coming in at\nlast place. The tracks are well thought\nout, with the plenty of power ups, in the\nform of coloured gates, allowing a certain degree of flexibility in the game\nplay. I low ever the game engine suffers\ngreatly when racing against other bug-gies. It often slows down to an intolerable frame rate when a pile up occurs and\nthen your buggy seems to take a life of\nits own with the handling.\nBuggy is definitely a wanna-be N64\nMario racing - it even copies the head\nover heels flip when you are hit by\nanother car, but does it at the expense\nof the game frame rate. Analogue control Is available In this game, but with the\nsteering done with the right thumb and\nthe acceleration with the left, it's counter\nintuitive. Those of you who can remember racing a remote control car will probably feel right at home with this odd\nconfiguration.\nThere are enough hidden tracks and\nnew cars to discover for those who persevere at this game, but with the sluggish graphics it lets the games down\nand makes it uncomfortable to play.\nAfter the fluidity of both Wipeouts, any\nracing game that does not conform to\nthat standard simply isn't really worth\nplaying.

The Electric Cafe is a joint project incorporating a weekly radio show on the Student Radio\nNetwork (National Student radio), this column in Felix\nand two club projects.\nAll these projects began about three years ago.\nDance music and electronica Is often viewed as face-less, cold computer music. As with many underground\nart forms this is a huge misconception. The term techno\nwas actual ll y first coined by Detroit musicians who had\ncreated music inspired by their jazz heroes such as Miles\nDavis and I ler bie Ilan cock. Many other influences are\napparent in early Detroit techno, such as Motown, the\nBlues Disco... The list goes on. Trance, acid, rave and\ngab ber all came later.\nI wanted to try and communicate the hidden\naspects of techno to both people who might not feel\nthey were into club culture and hardcore partygoers and\nDJs alike. Much of the best electronic music is just that,\nmusic that was created for dancefloor s and home listening pleasure. So I started a radio show called the Electric Cafe.\nEach show isn't an easy listening experience in the\nsense that you won't find seamless endless mixes of\none style of music throughout. We believe in diversity\nand the only criteria for a track to land on our\nplaylist is that it must be electronically created\nsome sense of the word and trying to push forward\nin some way.\nSo I play all styles from club-techno to brea-beats, tech-funk to deep house, drum'n 'bass\nelectro, jazz-fusion to experimental brats,\nand ambient.\nIf you would like to listen, Ihen the show\ngoes out on the Student Radio Network to over\nthirty universities every week for two hours. You\ncan catch us on IC Radio(999 AM) every Sunday\nnight/Monday morning between 1 and 3am. The column that appears in Felix each week j will run hand-in-hand with the radio show. Each\nguest that appears in the show will make an\nappearance in these pages. For example we featured exclusive interviews with Colin Dale (Kiss\n100FM) and Jeff Mills from Detroit last term. This!\nterm you will be able to read news from Ritchie\nI law tin( The Plastikman) and many others. I will\nalso talk about albums and singles and artists that!\nI particularly recommend. Look out for CD and club l ticket competitions too!\nAs well as all the excellent union events that have\nstarted up this year (Pop Tarts, Ile doni zm, etc) The Electric Cafe has also started its own monthly club project.\nSituated at The Union, we kicked off on Saturday 10th October. Many thanks to everyone who came to the\nfirst night. We are looking to make this event bigger and\nbetter represented. As with the philosophies of the radio\nshow, we will play a variety of music, from house to\ntechno to drum'n 'bass. Look out for some experienced,\nwell-known DJs who will be making appearances at this\nevent. The most important thing is that the venue is\nbrand new and state-of-the art and the entrance is completely free. I low many Saturday night clubs can boast\nthat?!\nIf you fancy yourself as a DJ then we would love to\nhear you spin at another event organised by the Electric Cafe. Designed as a chill out event, it takes place\nevery second Thursday in the back room of the Southside bar (an extremely chilled location). Last year this\nproved to be a popular event and we are expecting no\nless from this season. The music policy is completely\nfreestyle and eclectic. You can come and have a drink\nor spin some records or CDs. The next event is on Thursday 22nd October. If you would like to come down then\nmake your way to the back room of the Souithside bar\nbetween 7 and 11pm this Thursday. If you would like\nto spin then contact me by email (a. seth i@ ic.ac.uk).\nOK enough plugging for now! Onto the main business for this week. I have been playing a great new\nalbum called Soulspective (Offshoot Records) to death\non the radio show lately. It is out now on CD and vinyl\nand well-worth checking out.\nThe album was put together by Dave Mothersole,\na well-respected London DJ who plays many open-minded styles of music; techno, house and electro to\nname but a few. Dave also writes about electronic\nmusic. You can read his columns in Musik, Magic Feet\nand Jockey Slut.\nMany DJs release mix albums to showcase their mixing talents. The market is flooded with so many big-name mixes that many people don't know where to\nstart listening. Dave has very cleverly put a twist onto\nhis debut into the field of personalised DJ albums. This\nalbum consists of 10 tracks (8 on the vinyl) that are totally\nexclusive. You won't find these tracks anywhere else!\nw and Medicine labels have contributed a piece of music\ncalled Sandwich Man. It follows their normal style; of\nmusic that lies somewhere between house, techno and\ndub. A more minimal track with plenty of rhythm and\nfunk!\nNext up we have Paul Mac with Rhythm Subject.\nThis is slab of delicious jazz with an rhythm section. The\ntrack as a whole is excellent, mixing stuttering jazz\nbreakbeat s with smooth deep melodies. Unmissable!\nGerd is Gert-Jan Biji. I le has produced a track for this\nalbum called Arquasium. A really quirky little piece,\nthis takes some very cool rhythm patterns which continually build-up and breakdown, an infectious bassline\nand some lovely light keyboards. The result is a really\nwell put together piece of music.\nMatthew B. records as Bushwacka. I le is widely\nacknowledged as the king of breakbeat s and a highly\ntalented producer and DJ. I lis own label Plank is consistently regarded as being an outlet of electronic\nmusic of the highest calibre. The track on this album is\ncalled Demolition. It takes no prisoners and is definitely\nnot music to be put on in the background. Infectious,\ndance able and full of feeling, this is one of the highlights of Soulspective!\nPure Science's contribution here is Ooohhh. This\ntrack works well in all environments. I have played it on\ni chill-out section of my radio show and seen\n, j\\' it move people at The End nightclub! This is\ni.i Wm house meets techno at its sexiest and most\n*Th * t alluring. So often this kind of tech-house can\n' feel unsure of itself, or not merge well. Not\nOoohhh at all!\nStefan Robbers is pro b aly one of techno's \u2022most respected producers. I le has been mak-jing music for years and under a variety of\n\u2022pseudonyms. Sunset Boulevard is an excellent\ni!h \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 : \u2022 \u2022 1.1: 'ii it.11 \u2022>! il fi ii ;'n' has s thai nr or\npo rates many aspects of Stefan's normal\ntechno over the rhythm. I am sure that this track\nwill cross over and find Its way into the record\n\u2022\u2022boxes of many d'n'b DJs.\nThe pairing of Sterac (Steve Rachmad) and\nDave's concept was to approach some of his personal\nfavourite artists, whose tracks he has played down\nth tough the years, and ask them to record tracks for this\ncompilation. The result is an entertaining album that\nappeals to both the dancefloor and the bedroom\nusage.\nThe collection kicks off with a track from Ian O 'Brien\nwho has made a name for himself following excellent\nreleases on Pacific, Ferox, Clear and Compost Records.\nI lis musical style is soaked in jazz and tinged with subtle rh y tms and melodies. The unpredictable nature of\nhis music means that you will never know whether a future track will be harder and pumping or light and\nbreezy. I lis contribution to this album is called Tireless\nDevotion, and is a slower effort with a very full sound\nand contains a good mix of synthetic and organic com-pon ents. Swayzak who have already released on the Pagan\ne rome have appeared most notably on 100%\nPure Records from Amsterdam. Both artists\nhave been responsible for some beautiful\nexcursions into deep melodic techno; music\nwith expression. The track on this album (Som-sault) is no exception. It contains all the usual\nira de marks, a lovely string section, melody and\nvariety. Not your average so-called four to the\nfloor boredom at all.\nMy personal favourite track here is called Boxed\nfrom Starpeace (Charles Webster). This is deep house\nat its best. I have no lh ing to really say about this track\nexcept listen to it for yourself, it is unbelievably good!\nFinally the Future Beat Alliance put a wrap on\nthings with New Path. This is slower and very melodic.\nEchoing and bursting with life, this is music to dream\nlo!\nAll in all, an excellent and versatile EP. I am sure this\nwill find its way into many DJ boxes, but if played in the\nright environment will be the perfect comedown after\na hard night's clubbing. It also acts as an excellent way\nfor the unit i a ted to get to know a variety of artists on\none CD. If only more music was like this...!\nSoulspective is out now on Offshoot Records. Look\nout for Dave Mothersole who appears frequently at\nmany top fond on nights.\na lick seth i "

    "content": "19 October 1998\nTHE JON SPENCER BLUES\nEXPLOSION\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022*\nThe 'Blues Explosion demonstrate their excitement In\nobtaining a four-star review\nUn surprisingly, The Jon Spencer\nBlues Explosion make blues\nmusic. With the standard three-piece guitar band set up and a plentiful\namount of soul, the 'Blues Explosion\nhave always managed to impress. Their\nunique style involves the marriage of\nclassic blues and modern style with the\naggression of a rabid dog thrown in for\ngood measure. Their new album,\nAcme, is no exception to this as the\n'Blues Explosion stay right on form, and\nthe production from Steve Albini of\nNevermind fame ensures that the JSBX\ndon't pull any punches either.\nThe music featured on Acme is classic JSBX with powerful vocals and perfectly timed breaks and beats. Track titles\nalso follow the standard blues formula.\nThere's Lovln' Machine, Do You Wanna\nGet Heavy?and, of course, a blues mentioning track called Talk about The Blues.\nEach title cannot, however, manage to\nsum up the feeling and originality that\nhas obviously gone into each song.\nAs for the overall quality of the\nalbum, Acme never falters. The aforementioned Lovin' Machine is a classic,\nand the uniquely titled Blue Green Olga\nis a full-on no holds barred affair. The free\nflowing style of crescendo and diminuendo the Blues Explosion impressively\nemploy and the production from Albini\nensures the listener Is always given an\nengaging listen.\nIn conclusion, Acme is a wonderful\nalbum which provides more style and\nfeeling than ten of your average indie\nbands could muster. Sit back and let Jon\nSpencer explode the blues through your\nstereo. CI\nJames\nJAZZ & ROCK GIG\nUnion Concert Hall\nDuring Freshers week some of\nyou just might have chanced\nupon the Concert hall. It\nseemed that quite a number of you\nsomehow did drag yourself and your\nbeer to the top floor of the Union on\nthe first Thursday of term and had the\ngood fortune to watch three of the\nUnion's premiere bands in action.\nFirst up were THE MEN ON THE\nGRASSY KNOLL, a supergroup of kinds\ndrawing on the remarkable vocals of a certain Mark Elliott (ex of POG fact fans),\nthe shade wearing, guitar playing Mat\nand the tight playing of regulars Jon on\nbass (who seems to be becoming somewhat of a sex symbol these days, or so\nI'm told) and James on drums. The lights\nwent up, and off they went running\nthrough an impressively tight set of\ncrowd please rs starting with Let me Entertain you and ending with a particularly\nkick in' rendition of Killing in the Name of\ngiving Mark an excuse to say 'Fuck' lots\nof times....definitely lots of enthusiasm\nand fun in the music\nNext up, the mighty Cereal Killer\nwere unleashed upon the unsuspecting\nfresher s! For those who still haven't heard them then why not? Possibly the\nsecond best band ever to come out of\ncollege, they've still got plenty of time to\ncatch up with Queen in album\nsales and on the evidence of this gig\nwho would bet against them? The summer break has obviously been fruitful\nwith their set being perfected and,\nrefreshingly, also experimented with.\nPaul on drums pounded away as if there\nwas no tomorrow, the guitarists Simon\nand Shaz played almost as one and\nGavin's singing was the best I 've heard\nfrom him. From the entrance music to\nthe soulful playing by all four of them,\ntheir brand of rock is always a treat. Most\nof all though it is the sense of fun that\npervades their music which draws in the\ncrowds - this is the standard all the fresh-ers out there starting bands have to\nbeat.\nFold were on next and looked quite\nnervous about following Cereal Killer.\nThey played a particularly tight and polished set as we might expect after a long sabbatical, with a pleasantly\nGarbage-esque produced sheen to it.\nProfessionally turned out with custom\nmade drapes bearing their bastard is ed BBC logo, no one could fault their performance yet it lacked the atmosphere\nof fun that had been built up earlier -dare I say it was soulless? Certainly they\ndidn't have the charisma that's required\nto bring in and keep the crowds. A shame as their use of samples is a good\nexample of what can be achieved here\nat Imperial.\nAll in all a good evening and I hope\nmore of you will make it to future Jazz\nand Rock club events or even be part of\none of the bands on stage. Come to the\nnext gig before the bands become too\nbig to play for free - you'll be pleasantly\nsurprised. CI Martin\nSingles Candyskins - Somewhere Under London\nPut together well but it just doesn't appeal. Although\nthe tune bounces due to the fancy guitars, the guy's vocals are bit dull ('somewhere under London' sounds\nvery much like 'summer under London' - okay!). A little bit more enthusiasm would have done it for this\ntrack, but it was not to be, I'm afraid.\nJon Spencer Blues Explosion - ACME\nStarts off very mellow with deep, soothing vocals. Great\nbass on this and lovely guitar-strings, and did I also get\na hint of organ? Blues fans will love this to bits. The three\nsongs on the B side are as good, with additional influences of jazz and pop.\nStetsasonlc - Talkln'AII That Jazz\nThe vibrant saxophone Intro is quickly followed by\ndecent (slow) rapping. The sax player really is the star\nof this 'hip-hop' band (as they like to call themselves);\nunmistakably fresh, funky jazz. The promo version that\nI got contains five mixes, totaling over 35 minutes, but\ndon't expect more than 20 minutes of this due to the\ncrappy rule imposed on singles.\nSugarglider - Love In Vain\nStrangely enough, this pop-ish tune kicks off with deep\nand funky beats and then the sweet female vocals of\nthe lead singer does damage. I picture this tune being\nplayed at high volume while driving well over the limit\nin an open-top Lotus Elise (under the influence of alcohol and drugs of course). I guess that makes it a tune\nto buy then?\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Dem 2 - Destiny\nBeen waiting a long time for this to surface. Absolutely\nsuper-cool, silky r'n' b with wicked beats. The beats rock\nyou immediately and the vocals are full of soul (the\nfemale vocals on the male also works). The only bad\nthing about this tune is that it might be just a bit repetitive, but switching between the Radio Edit and the\nRhythm Masters' remix (with heavier beats, fewer vocals\nand clever sequencing) should take care of that. Go out\nand buy this on the 18th, no questions asked. Locked\nOn do it once again - baad b wo yz, coming through!\nStony Sleep - Lady Lazarus\nI just hate songs that start off dead boring with depressingly slow vocals and then suddenly abuse the fuck out\nof your ear-drums with a blur of drums and shouting.\nThe lyrics aren't all that interesting anyway, and why he\nneeds to shout at the top of his voice beats me - the\nboring vocals were just as audible.\nAdamskl's Thing - Intravenous Venus\nFunky beats and fresh keyboards with catchy lyrics\nfrom the crisp vocals of Gerideau. 'Old-timer' Adamski's thought and production all come together naturally. A mix with minimal vocals and slightly heavier bass would\ndefinitely fill any dance-floor, and the synthesized\nvocals on MARKI's Twisted Soul Vocal remix are inter-e sting. Jack- Steamln'\nOne of those rare singles that has the words on the\nsleeve. This one really does grow on you. Excellent keyboard Intro and then sharp vocals. Its musical direction\nseems to be indecisive though; we hear the e bow and\nsaxophones on this too but ask why. Nevertheless, it\nholds together and you're waiting for the chorus to\nrepeat endlessly.\nEVE 6 - Inside Out\nThe chorus is moving, literally, but the verses only just\nhave enough rhythm to maintain it. Still, it's loud, hard\nand vicious. What more do you want to jump around\nand smash bottles to? Showerheadon the B side is just\nas good and a little softer. Groups like Green Day\nwould probably consider this chart-hit material. C] Abu\n\n"

Imperial came back with two tries\ndue to the skill of Jamie \"Superman\"\nDuggin. While Jamie waited for his well\ndeserved hat-trick, Telfor \"the French\nWelshman\" Beynon squeezed in\nanother try.\nImperial should have capitalised on\nthe favourable slope in the second half,\nbut instead Brunei closed the gap. This\nonly fired up the IC machine and helped\nTelfor run in his second try while Dan\n'Pharaoh' I liga zi used his hydraulic rams\nto push a couple over. There was some\ngreat bashing from Chucko, which was\nextremely entertaining and deserves a mention.\nOverall, open play and tackling was\ngood, whilst set plays need working\non. IC played skilful rugby, especially\nconsidering it was the beginning of the\nseason, although some scrappy play let\nBrunei keep the score l inc respectable.\n2nd XV\nIC34 -14 BRUNEL\nAfter an aggressive start which saw john Stevenson crash over the line for his first\nbig try for IC within five minutes, the\nscene was set. Constant forward domination saw the scrum half, Yuen Lewis,\nsneak In under the defence for the second try. Before the completion of\ntwenty minutes, J. ten ner displayed\nsuperior pace down the line to score.\nCommitted defending frustrated\nthe early Brunei attacks, and the first half\nwas wrapped up with Jimbo speeding\ndown the line to score and then con-vert ing.[ he second half saw a poor start for\nIC with Brunei scoring an easy try straight\nafter kick off. Imperial soon woke up\nand came straight back with Jimbo scoring just as easily. Poor discipline let\nBrunei score again, and they converted\nit easily. Strong forward play and pace\nsaw john Stevenson score his second,\nfinishing off as he had begun. The final\nwhistle gave IC their first victory and a promising start to the BUSA season.\nImperial athlete\ngoes to World\nChampionships\nTarik Djeddour of the cycling and running clubs represented Great Britain this\nsummer on the World Short Course\nDuathlon Championships, in St. Wendel,\nSouth Germany. The event attracted a thousand athletes from as far afield as\nAustralia and the USA. The event comprised a10 km run followed by a40 km bike ride and finished with a further\n5km run. The course was very hilly and\nwet, and Tarik's time of 2hrs11 minutes\nsaw him finishing 21st out of 60 in his\nage group of 20-24 (3rd placed Briton).\nBoth Tarik and Hadlcy Skelton (19)\ncompeted in the National Duathlon\nChampionships in June and finished 4th and 2nd respectively in their age groups.\nThis gave them automatic selection for\nthe World Championships. Unfortunately Hedley could not compete at the\nWorlds due to lack of finances.\nTarik has already been pre-selected\nto compete in the World Middle Distance Duathlon Championships in\nSwitzerland in 1999 and is aiming to\nget a top 5 position. Hedley is looking\nforward to qualifying again and competing in his first World Championships\nin 1999.\nBoat Club\nT 'was the crack of dawn and all through\nthe land not a creature was stirring.... but\nfor a megaphone, some launches and\na few IC top squad boats fighting up the\nriver. 6.30am and those hardy men and\nwomen of the college were on the first\nmorning session of the year. Last year's season was capped off in true ICBC\nstyle, with three boats qualifying for the\nHenley Royal Regatta. IC won the Temple Challenge cup (the international student Vllls event), were finalists in the\nVisitors' Cup (the top international student IVs event), narrowly losing to\nOxford's top IV, while the \"bottom\" IC\ncrew pushed the University of London's top boat all the way to the line, also in\nthe Visitors' Cup. Ihe Henley performances reflected IC's year long do mi nance, in both the men's and women's squads heading the University league\ntables and becoming BUSA champions.\nThe current \u00a31.7 million re decoration of\nthe boat house will be completed in\nseveral months time and should house\nthe huge intake in novice and experienced oarsmen and women who have\nrecently started this season's training.\nThe new boat hous c has been designated a \"centre of excellence\" by the\namateur rowing association - one of\nonly three in Britain and the only one in\nLondon, which should help maintain\nthe club's results.\n2nd XI\nLSE 3 - 5 IC\ntor many 1st years this was a debut for\nIC and for the rest it was a long awaited\nreturn to the new football season.\nThe match started in the worst possible fashion with LSE scoring twice in\nthe first 10 minutes. The first goal came\nfrom the pen ally spot, from a decision\nthat seemed to confuse even the LSt\nteam. After that setback, IC fought back\nwell. G.I. Joules took a free kick from just\noutside the box, which he blasted past\nthe wall and into the top corner. LSE\ndominated the rest of the half, but only\nled 2-1 at half time.\nThe second half started In the best\npossible fashion, with another awful rc fer e eing decision giving us a penalty for\na foul outside the box (who's com-plain ing?). Once again G.I. Joules was\nthere to put away the spot kick, but the\nbest was still to come. The superb\nG.I. Joules (guess who's the captain?)\npicked up the ball 25 yards out and with\nhis weaker left foot, he drove the ball\ninto the top corner, hitting the bar on its\nway in. IC was now well in control and\nfrom a giant kick from IC's very impressive keeper, Dave headed a \"Wimble-don style\" goal past the opposition\nkeeper. The next goal came from a flowing move down the right and\nended with a superb header from\" li ny\" Martin - the smallest man on the pitch.\nLSE got a goal back, but a convincing win to start the season should give\nus confidence for a very successful sea-son. Report by C. Batley\nHockey\nIC I42 ROYAL FREE I The tentative start was put down to the\nday being a big day for England. IC were\nalso in need of a good win to get the\nseason off in style. IC were 1-0 down at\nhalf time. Noddy's storming run and\nswan dive led to a penalty, which was\nduly buried by Big Titties for the first goal\nof season. A fantastic second half performance followed, with the whole\nteam firing on all cylinders, most having\nplayed together last season.\nIC's second goal was crucial as it\nbroke the will of Royal Free. A good final\nresult was achieved after Fluffy Cherub\nmanaged to bundle two flukey balls\nover the line.

    "content": "19 October 1998 Columns 9\nMedics Combine for Freshers' Week Frolics\nMy dear readers, how are? Survived fresh-ers' week did we. I hope that you are\nfeeling better than I am because this\nintrepid observer of the perfect microcosm of the world that is IC has a severe\ncase of fresher s flu brought on by a truly\nhectic social calendar.\nThe last week has been rather fun\nwith starting for me with the debauchery\nthat was the Mary's campus road show.\nThe night started well when I was\nexpelled from DB's where I was attending a friend's birthday. The second most\nupsetting thing about that was that I was\nnot even close to being under the influence, even by IC stewards' puritanical\nstandards. After deciding that I was too\nout numbered to fight the point I headed\nwith some of the other expel lees to\nMary's to witness the aftermath of the\nroad show. At this point I have to congratulate the so far anonymous fresher s who participated in the\nnightmare that was the\negg race. In the end the\nnight ended prematurely due to a slight miss calculation as\nto the amount that I had to drink. Incidentally, I would like to say to any of the\npeople that I spoke to on Tuesday and\nhave subsequently seen that it was nice\ntalking to you.\nWednesday saw the start of the Charing Cross hosted events that kicked off\nwith the pub-crawl. I was co-opted to lead\nsome of the brave souls who had taken\ntheir life into their hands and headed out\nto enjoy the delights of the OSP, Distillers,\nFinnegan's and the William Morris. The\nended well at the Rutland and Anchor\nand here I witnessed a classic example\nof how confusing the union between\nCXW and SMI I can be. The night was\nending on a boisterous note (the best\nNick Newton\nsort) with two groups\nof would-be bus kers politely explaining to\nthe other group in\nvoices that would make patrons of the\nRoyal Opera I louse weep that Mary's was better than The Cross and vice-versa.\nSeasoned observers will at this point be\nclearing their collective throats in preparation to say something along the lines\nof \"Well, what else is new\" but the confusing thing was that the while the songs\nwere partisan the groups were not l Thursday saw the bop at Charing\nCross, an event with the theme of togas\nand Tequila. Perhaps not the most obvious combination but an entertaining\none if only for the boring people, among\nwhom I include myself, who did not\nwear togas who got to have a laugh at\nthe expense of those who did. Once\nagain alcohol was consumed and the\nless said the better.\nFinally my attention was drawn to the\ndelightful/sickening letter of praise to\nAndy Ile eps that was published in the\nlast issue of Felix. Opinions ranged from\n\"what a lovely thought\" to \"what does this\nwant off Andy?\" I myself have mixed\nviews. Admittedly the letter was perhaps\na little too fawning in its praises but the\nthought appeared genuine. National\npapers have turned the art of knocking\npoliticians into a full time occupation\nand on the occasions that people do a good job their achievements are often\nplayed down due to other factors.\nRegardless of whether or not you think\nthat Andy did a good job overall it is\npleasing to see that someone had the\nmanners to say thank you and to show\ntheir appreciation. Perhaps, this will set\na precedent for the future, one can only\nhope.\nHow to Make Americana\nFor the benefit of all those of you living\nout there in post Basics food hell or\nthose of you who started the year with\na crate of baked beans, I am here. Come\nforth from those dark corners of mouldy\ncheese and half eaten pies. Do not hes-it ate. Step into the kitchen and bond\nwith your cooker.\nSince it is nearly impossible to find a student who doesn't own a truckload of\npasta and a tin of tomatoes, a good\nplace to start our journey through cookery land is Italy (a country who's chefs\nseem to have students in mind). Americana is a popular pasta sauce (tomatoes\nand bacon) which with a little skill and\ninspiration is pure magic. My own personal additions to the dish are red pepper and tuna but this is not essential. For\ntwo people you will require:\n1 red onion\n*\" 1 red pepper\n*\u2022 Vi lb. Tomatoes\n*\u2022 some garlic\n*\u2022 a red chilli\n\u00bb\u2022 lots of bacon\nfresh herbs; parsley, chervil....\nA tin of tuna\njuice of half a lemon\n\u00ab\u2022 6 or 7 capers (If you Include tuna)\nStart by finely chopping all the ingredients. The easiest way to do this with the\npepper is to chop off the top and bottom\nand slice open the cylinder. Once this has\nbeen done you can run a knife along the\ninside and remove the seeds and white\ngunk in one go.\nNow to cook. On a moderate flame,\nheat a good amount of olive oil in a pan rather than dominates the end result so\nand s aute off the red pepper, onion and don't go overboard. After a minute add\nbacon. Be generous\nwith the oil because it\nwill take on all the\nflavours you add to the\npan and then coat the\npasta.\nWhen the bacon\nis beginning to crisp\nup add the garlic and\nBurning\nWater\nthe chopped tomato\n(minus the seeds),\ncapers and some\nblack pepper. You may\nnot need much salt\nbecause of the bacon,\nso it's best to add that\nat the end.\nCook on for just a chilli. Don't be too liberal, as the chilli is minute, to avoid loosing the fresh taste\ndesigned to act as a seasoning in this of the tomato and add the flakes of tuna\ndish. It pulls together the other flavours and lemon juice. The lemon will lighten\nthe dish and clean the palette. Once the\ntuna is hot serve with the pasta of your\nchoice.\nIn a restaurant I worked in over the\nsummer we'd use fresh tuna steaks and\nset them on top of the pasta with a little\ntape na de( black olive puree). I low ever, if that sounds a little too Masterchef for\nyou, don't worry - either way it Is delicious\nso enjoy eating like people in the real\nworld for once.\nIf you have any dish you'd like me to\ncover or questions mail me on\nn. todd1@ lc.ac.uk\nDellaD\nImperial & University College Malaysian Societies\nAfrican & Carribean Societies\njointly presents[' Spart4 A Wednesday 21st October 1998 10pm til 3am DJ's Lady Gee Jee Daddy Baby lace Heaven KL' Rock Garden London + KL ' Asian Top DJ Winner Tickets at the door \u00a3 8 before11 pm, \u00a3 1 0 after We're bringing back the soul classics and new hiphop flav a's just for you.

    "content": "14 Music 19 October 1998\nPLACEBO\nWithout You I'm Nothing\nPlacebo let rip with\ntheir second album\n\u2022 * * y2 Placebo are pretty much a household name now, you know the\nwhole deal, black eyeliner and\nBrian Molko's sexual nature. They've\nmade the front cover of nearly all the\nmusic press since they broke into the\nnation's consciousness after the release\nof the re-vamped single version of\nNancy Boy. Their debut Placebo (why\ndo bands never think of imaginative\ntitles anymore?) wasn't exactly shifting\nshed loads of units beforehand but\nthen soon everyone wanted to get their\nhands on it. Placebo was thrash y, trashy\nand definitely full-on, so have they managed to live up to their own and other\npeople's expectations with this second\nhelping?\nThe two singles from Without\nYou...will certainly be comforting to fans\nwho want more of where Placebo was\ncoming from. The version of Pure Morning on the album is much more toned\ndown than the single but this doesn't mean that it has lost any of its edge. One\nof the most classic lines of any song\nreleased this summer has to be: 'A friend\nin need's, a friend indeed / A friend with\nweed is better'. Last week's 'Essential\nChoon', You Don't Care About Us, and it\nis certainly worthy of this esteemed pos i tion, is probably the best track on the\nentire album. Here Placebo appear to\nhave driven down the road heading\ntowards 'jan gly pop' which they detoured\nwell clear of on their previous LP, happier\nwith grating thrash outs instead.\nThe energy rush of the singles is\nonly mirrored in a couple of other songs.\nBrick Shithouse and Allergic (to Thoughts\nof Mother Nature), while the rest of the\nalbum is an exercise in self indulgence\non the part of Brian Molko and friends.\nThese atmospheric moody ballads sound\nat times as though they would be better\nheard as a backdrop to some 'film noir'.\nPlacebo performing ballads is admittedly\nnot as appreciated as Placebo racing\nalong on grinding guitar mosh along s, but if you allow them to grow on you,\nthen you soon see through to their\nsoothing beauty.\nPlacebo haven't rehashed their first\nalbum and tried to feed us more of the\nsame; instead they have opted for a more introspective sounding album\nwhich incidentally casts an air of maturity\nto their new songs. There isn't any sense\nof togetherness which is what you'd expect when half the album is a manic\nmosh out, and the other half contains a few sublime ballads and a couple of\nalbum fillers. This may be due to the\ndreaded 'difficult' second album syndrome that affects many bands' careers,\nand although Placebo haven't quite managed to emerge from it with a pristine\nand shiny A+, they have passed pretty\nComfortably. CI\nJason\nWHALE\nAll Disco Dance Must End In Broken Bones\nSILVER SUN\nNeo Wave\nStockholm's Whale have certainly toned down the\n'quirk in ess' factor since their debut album, despite the\ncover closely resembling a scene from an early X Files\nepisode.\nThere are no tracks which show the 'in your face' an the mic quality of their debut single (and MTV favourite) / lobo I lump in' Slobo Babe but this doesn't mean that Whale have become\nboring - far from it.\nThe single that has been released from this album is Four\nBig Speakers, which can be best described as trip-hop. Although\na good track, it's not really an accurate representation of what\ncan be found on the album, which shows quite a diverse range\nof styles. If you can imagine a slowed version of Sleeper's Lie\nDetector from The It Girl album coupled with a Faith No More\nmosh-along chorus and some solid guitar riffs, then you have\nLosing Girl. In my opinion, one of the best tracks on the\nalbum. For some lighter listening and sheer hum m ability So\nWhere You're Feeling Free and No Better ate to be re com mended. The tune Puma Gym is especially catchy - a built-in\nBatman-esque backdrop to the tune is an added bonus. The\nonly poor track is the last tune, entitled 2 Cord Song which\nlengthens the album up to nearly an hour and is too Dire Straits\nfor my liking. Fifty minutes would have sufficed nicely\nAltogether, this album is one hour of diverse music, which\nis much easier on the ear than the debut album. OK, it took\nseveral listens to get into it, but it was worth it.\nIf what I have written hasn't convinced you to buy this -at least nip down to your nearest music store and ask to listen to it, vo u will be pleasantly surprised. CI\nKatherine\n\u2022\nAnd All IC Degrees End In\nStudent Loans\nP lease let this not be the new\nwave. Silver Sun's singles have\nsuggested a sugary feel good\ntinge. Sixteen tracks of this and it's about time the sweet shop on the corner closed. Opener Cheerleader is a strange beast and a complete red her-ring. It's all out 80s heavy rock and one\nmust assume that they are actually taking the piss. Fither that or too many\ndrugs were taken and this track was\nvoted in as a good idea. Rather appropriately it starts the album with the line,\n'I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried\nand I tried.' In case you were wonder-ing, I tired. Easily.\nThere are other smatterings of\nappropriate lyrical genius splattered\nacross the album. There's the cheesier\nthan chee sil y cheesy cheese puffs stupid rock of Would've If I Could've, 'Well\nI would've if I could've but I couldn't so\nI didn't so I should have, if I could have.\nFuck off! There's the poignantly titled,\nfrom a critic's perspective. Dead End,\n'Take me to nowhere. I fit in there.' And\nnot forgetting the 'Oh oh pixie pixie, do,\ndo, doing what they do,' of Pixie, Pixie.\nGranted, a lot of lyrics look inane when\nput into cold black and white but if you\nlisten to this album, you'll understand\nfrom where the irritation arises. Too\nmuch, too little, too late? Too much,\nmel h inks, too much. CI Dennis\n\n"

    "content": "'1 News 19 October 1998\nHybrid\nEntry in\nDoubt\nby David Roberts\nThis week's meetings of both University\nof London Union Council and IC Union\nCouncil were dominated once again by\nquestions over medical students' eligibility for sports teams.\nThe topic, which had been a major\nbone of contention at colleges across\nLondon throughout last year, seemed to\nhave been settled at the end of last\nterm when the British Universities Sports\nAssociation accepted the concept of socalled 'hybrid entry'. Under the previous\nsystem, medical students could only\nplay for their own side where one\nexisted, but could play for their parent\ninstitution where one did not. In the\ncase of Imperial, this meant that medical\nstudents played for ICSM teams in\nhockey, football and rugby competitions, but were otherwise represented in\nCollege wide teams.\nA clarification of the ruling, how-ever, was demanded by UCL students,\nleading to Monday's debate at ULU. The\nULU Vice President (Sports), Nick Dunnett, put forward a proposal which\nwould allow medical students to choose\nwhether to play for their own sides or for\ntheir parent institutions. In other words,\nICSM students would be able to opt to\nplay for either ICSM Rugby or ICU Rugby.\nDespite an absence of representatives\nfrom medical schools, this proposal,\ndescribed by Mr Dunnett as \"a minor\nclarification\", was accepted by the meet-ing.\nImportantly, however, the BUSA\nrules have not changed; only those for\nUniversity of London Leagues. Consequently, the possibility of teams fielding\ncompletely different squads for different\ncompetitions now exists, although Mr\nDunnett (who sits on the BUSA executive) believes that BUSA will accept this\nruling nationally. Other senior figures\nseemed less sure.\nThe issue was raised again at Tuesday's IC Union Council meeting. Former\nICU President Andy Heeps criticised the\nICU delegation's support of the pro-pos al, which he saw as \"a massive\nbreach of trust\" which would \"wipe out\neverything that was achieved last year\".\nHowever, current ICU President Dave\nHellard, countered that the new ruling\n\"does not contradict what was passed by\nICU last year, as hybrid entry was never\nvery clearly defined\". Mr Heeps voiced\nthe concerns of all medical students\npresent, fearing that this policy could\nlead to all medical teams being disqualified from competition. Deputy President Chris Ince countered that the ICU\ndelegates (who included Messrs Ince\nand Hellard) only accepted the motion\nonce \"Nick Dunnett promised that all the\nproblems raised lover BUSA and transfers between teams] would be over-come\".\nWith no satisfactory conclusion\nreached, Mr Hellard accepted that there\nare clearly greater problems surrounding\nthe issues than at first realised, and\npromised to rethink the ICU position on\nthe issue.\nMalaysian\nMelee\nby Havaca Johnson\nThe devastation of the Malaysian Economic crisis is being felt by many of the\n18,000 Malaysian students studying in\nthe UK. Amongst their number are the\nfour percent of Malaysian students at\nImperial College.\nMalaysian government funding for\nthe exchange students is diminishing.\nThe Malaysian tmb as sy stated fifteen\nmembers of the Malaysian Student Commission have already been sent back to\nMalaysia due to the lack of funds.\nThey went on to say, \"Many students have been sent home. Some are\nin their second year of study and don't have anything to show for it\".\nAccording to recent newspaper\nreports, Malaysia is allowing students\nnear g raud ation to finish their degrees.\nSome fresher s are being forced to drop\ntheir current overseas programs to\nA doctor who pricked her finger with\na needle at Charing Cross Hospital has\nbeen awarded damages of nearly\nreturn to Malaysia.\nMany students, colleges and universities are taking action to make up for\nthe lack of funds. Universities such as\nCambridge and Oxford have already set\nup forms of scholarship funding for\nMalaysian students. Many of the scholarships are based on merit and academic achievements.\nOther institutions such as UMIST\nand Bournemouth University, are setting\nup distant learning options and branch\ninstitutions in Malaysia, allowing the students to have a more cost-effective edu-cation.\nAccording to the Malaysian\nEmbassy, universities are also holding\ngraduation ceremonies in Malaysia. By\nhaving the ceremonies in Malaysia families of the students can attend the event\nwithout having to pay for their transportation to Britain.\nTo find out more information about\nscholarships and educational options\nfor Malaysians studying in the UK,\nhttp://www.br lt co un. org.my/ provides a wealth of information.\ning, that IC was not considering implementing top up fees, and that this\nwould not be affected by other institutions' actions.\nIn brief...\nGet on your bike -If you can find it...\nOnce again students are being\nasked to make sure their bikes are\nlocked up whilst on campus. There\nhave been approximately twenty bike\nthefts on the South Kensington campus since August, despite strong measures taken by security, including the\nuse of plain-clothed officers on patrol.\n\"We are doing everything we possibly\ncan\" explained Ken Weir, Deputy Security Manager at the college. He advised\nstudents to use D locks rather than\nchains, and to attach bikes to recognised 'bike parks' and not to railings\nand signposts.\nCyclists arc also reminded that\nthere is no parking in Prince Consort\nRoad during the Mount Batten Festival,\nwhich this year takes place between 6\nand 8 November. Bicycles found after\nthe evening of 5 November will be\nremoved by the police.\n\u00a3500,000 for Doctor\nAfraid of Needles\n\u00a3500,000. The doctor, who cannot be\nnamed, stabbed her finger in 1992 on\na used hypodermic needle, which had\nbeen left on a trolley at the Imperial\nteaching hospital.\nShe did not contract any disease,\nbut her unease with needles following\nthe incident developed into a phobia\nso severe, that in October 1994 she felt\nno longer able to practice medicine.\nShe decided to press for compensation\nafter reading a similar case, and was\nthis month awarded \u00a3465,000 in dam-ages, plus legal costs.\nAlthough the gravity of phobia is\nnot in question, there appears to be\nsome doubt in the medical community\nas to whether the incident in question\nwas the underlying cause. Claire\nRaynor, on behalf of the Patient's Association, said that the amount given\nwas far too high and could have been\nbetter spent on operations.\nVery, very, very briefly\nDespite murmurs from LSE on supplementing their tut ion fee income by\nthe use of additional charges to stu-dents, the Imperial Rector Sir Ronald\nOxburgh stated, and confirmed in writ-\n"

    "content": "19\nOctober\n1998\nIf Issue\n1122\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Death Knell for the NUS?\nU MIST and Imperial College Students' Unions are to hold a conference on surviving outside the\nNUS later this month. It is thought that\nthe event will be attended by Union officers from many of Britain's top universi-ties.\nThe conference will take place on 30\nOctober at UMIST, and has been unofficially titled 'CHESA: The Way of the\nFuture', CHESA being the 'Coalition of\nHigher Education Student Associations'.\nIt will take place in the afternoon and will\nbe an informal affair, consisting of\nspeeches and discussion. Speakers\ninclude David Hellard (ICU President),\nSabih Behzad (UMIST Union President)\nand Nick Bibby (St Andrew's Student\nAssociation President).\nUMIST is currently in the process of\nd is affiliating from the NUS, although\nby Ed Sexton\ntechnically it is still a member. The decision\nto d is affiliate this academic year was\nmade some months ago but, ac cod ring to Sabih Behzad, the formal announcement will not be made until 4 November.\nThe NUS has asked UMIST to hold a uni-vers it y wide referendum on the issue\nbefore d is affiliating, which would be similar to the procedure followed when\nImperial voted to leave the NUS almost\ntwenty years ago.\nThe conference was initially a joint\nventure between UMIST's Students'\nUnion and ICU. Help has since been\nreceived from Northern Services, a buying consortium which many non-NUS\naffiliated Scottish Universities use. Nick\nBibby, who is a member of the Northern\nServices Executive, explained that the\ngroup could match the NUS on most\nprices, and sometimes\nimprove on them. I le also\nclaimed that Northern Services offers\n\"more flexibility\", as universities can use\nother service providers as well (a scheme\nprohibited to NUS members). \"One of\nthe advantages is it I Northern Services]\nis quite small\" explained Mr Bibby. I le\ndenied he was going to the conference\nsimply to promote Northern Services. \"I am keen lo allow impartial decisions... I am not going down there to slag off\nanother organisation\" he responded.\nSabih Behzad was also quick to deny\nthe conference was an attempt lo break\nup the NUS. \"We are not forcing people\nto leave\", he explained, \"we are there lo\ndiscuss what the benefits arc of staying,\nand what the benefits are of leaving\". He\nthoughtfully added \"Universities have\nleft... and not suffered. I Leaving] can\nsave an awful lot of money\".\nDavid Il ellard, while still insisting that\nIhe conference was a forum for exchanging ideas, was more forceful in his criticism of the NUS. \"UMIST leaving has got\npeople thinking\" he commented; \"there\nis a growing discontent with the service\nIhey [the NUS] arc providing\". Dave Hellard explained that his role at the conference would be informing other\nuniversities of \"how well we do outside\nthe NUS\". When asked which other universities would be attending the conference Dave Il ellard was unwilling to\nspecify names, but did say that a lot of\npeople were going, and that all the institutions involved were \"very, very good\".\nA representative from the NUS thought\nii \"strange lh at Imperial is talking to\nUMIST\".

After months of hype the Lauryn\nIi ill album The Miseducation of Lauryn\n/////dropped and quite simply blew the\nhype away, it took the world by storm.\nMany people have claimed this to be\nthe best album of the year, well people\nwere right. Lauryn has become one of\nthe most famous young black women\nin the world today and this album will\nprobably elevate her to the same standing as Aretha Franklin; Lauryn of course\nmastermind ered the re-launch of\nAretha, recreating the Aretha sound for\nthe hip hop style nineties, as shown\nwith A Rose Is Still A Rose. The even\nmore surprising thing to note is the lack\nof any assistance from her Fugees\nmates Wyclef and Pras, who were off\nsomewhere making some wac k shit.\nThe reason for their absence is unclear,\nalthough rumours about a Fugees split\nhave been going around. Even without\nthe boys, many tracks sound like they\nmay have been taken direct from a Fugees album with Everything is\nEverything and Lost Ones being the\nbest in regard. Wyclef and Pras might\nbe missing but two other stars have\ngiven their sultry tones to Lauryn,\nD 'Angelo kicks it on the slow groove\nNothing Even Matters, while Mary J Blige sings on / Used To Love I Urn.\nOther tracks of real quality are Ex-factor,\nDop Wop and the tilt e track f he Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. The album\nis devoid of any really poor tracks and it\nmay, in years to come, be considered a turning point in hip-hop, only time will\ntell. (Check Lost Ones it's a killer). CI\nMilen\nH ere we go. as you all may have\nrealised Old Skool I lip I lop is\nfashionable again. With the\ninfluence of certain remixer s, groups\nlike Run DMC and the Jungle Brothers\nhave reinvented themselves for the\nlate 90s. And so Paid in Full, Eric B and\nRakim's first album, which was originally\nreleased in 1987 is set to be re-released.\nThis time however it is re-mastered and\nwith the addition of some remixes. So it\nlooks like Paid in Full: The Platinum Edition is looking to cash in on the hype.\nThat having been said, Eric B and\nRakim were highly Influential hip hop\npioneers from the middle of the 80s. Rakim, whose own solo album was\nreleased earlier this year, was hailed by\nmany as the best MC ever. Dubious perhaps but there is no doubt of the quality of these two. With the inclusion of\nthese rare remixes especially, Coldcut's version of Paid in Full and Richie Rich's/ Know You Cot Soul, it is definitely\nworth buying. This is especially true if\nyou don't have any of Eric B and Rakim's back catalogue or you are a die hard fan\nA classic no doubt.CI\nRamzi\nLauryn Hill Where You At! Canibus Where You At! Right Here!\nThe start of another week in the hellhole we all know\nas Imperial College, but at least this week you have me\nand my incoherent ravings about the state of the R&B world. This week i'm bring in' ya a special review of the\nfinest album of the year, the much hyped Lauryn Flill\nalbum and a look at a killer rhyme from the ill est rapper Canibus.\nAs far as news goes - there isn't any! The MOBO\nawards are the only thing I can think of and they take\nplace today (Wedensday), so by the time you're reading this the awards would have been given out, the\nfights would have been fought and you'll be wondering what the fuck I'm chatting about; so I'm just gonna\nskip over to the singles and albums.\nCanibus is considered by most to be the most\nskilled rapper out there, his hard hitting lyrics actually\nmean something. After his lyrical battle with LL he\nneeded to come with the skills and with his debut\nalbum Can-l BuShe comes correct. Canibus brings hard\nlyrics over beats laid down by Wyclef (his manager),\nClark Kent and others. You gotta check Buckingham\nPalace where Canibus name checks Brixton and\nClapham (no mention of Ealing).\nR Kelly is dropping his latest offering the long\nplayer simply titled R. After hearing the first single from\nit, Half on a Baby, I wondered whether Robert was\ngonna bring anything new to the table. I le has a great\ntalent for the slow grooves, but they get a bit same\nsame after a while and I really didn't want to listen to\nan album full of ballads. So you can imagine my surprise\nwhen I actually checked it out only to discover it was\nonly half full of ballads and the rest were mid tempo\ngrooves. It holds your at ten ion and is def ln it ley worth\na listen.\nI ast year I started plugging this track after hearing\nit on the radio. I even called it the single of the year,\nonly problem was they never fucking released it. Now\na year later they have got round to releasing it and it's still as bang in' as last year. What's it called? Love Like\nThis from Faith Evans, it's quite simply stunning, vocals\nare br ii lant and Puffy comes through with the pro duc tion. Buy this!\nMilen\nPhat Selection\nThe Mlseducatlon of Lau fy n Hill (LP) - Lauryn\nHill\nSinging, rapping, writing, producing is\nthere anything this g jr j can't do?\nLove Like This- Faith Evans\nTune of the year?

Firstly,\nthere are the epics - Pocohontas and\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame spring\nto mind - historical stories, san it is ed for\nthe kiddie audience. Secondly, there\nare the classic Disney films, like\nHercules and Aladdin, full of larger-than-life characters, idiotic songs and\nbig comedy.\nLargely, this is due to two competing\nteams within the Disney set-up, producing different types of movies. Consequently, the two conflicting styles very\nrarely overlap - The Lion King standing as\na recent notable exception, when genuine comedy and a sense of plot com-bin e. Mulan therefore comes as a pleasant surprise, as, despite coming\nfrom the Pocohontas camp (which is\nvery clear from the style of character ani-mati on), it still contains genuine comedy.\nAdmittedly, this will probably come\nas less of a surprise once I tell you that\ncelebrity vocals are provided by Eddie\nMurphy. The resurgent comedian stars as\nthe voice of Mushu, the helpful dragon\n- providing a vein of comedy suitable for\nTwenty years on, Michael Myers is\na a ck to his old ways. Which basically means frightening the hell\nout of Jamie fee Curtis, and generally\nbeing extremely unpleasant and scary.\nOh, and hacking up lots of young girls\nin tight tops. You remember.\nTried and trusted as the formula may\nbe, Halloween 1120 has received both\ncritical acclaim and a hefty box office\nfrom the States. Above all, this latest\nreincarnation has been acclaimed as the\nscariest movie released in years, tipping\na knowing nod to the horror classics, and\neven including a cameo from Vivian\nLeigh.\nTo win a pair of tickets to see Halloween IT20, simply answer the following\nquestion:\nadults and children alike.\nThe plot is as an it is ed version of an\nancient Chinese legend and is, in itself,\nfairly weak (but then what Disney plot\nwasn't). We follow the adventures of\nMulan after she enters the army to stop\nher frail father from being forced to\nserve. To stop her enlisting, her ancestors\nconjure up Murphy's dragon, but he\nWould you pick a fight with that horse?\nfails, and Mulan sets off to fight the\ninvading I lun army.\nThe rest is, for the large part, utterly\npredictable, but that's hardly the point.\nMulan is fun.

I'm sure that the majority of\nyou have seen it already, so I'm sure\nthere's no need for a plot synopsis.\nOpinion continues to be split over\nthe merits of Jim Cameron's epic, but\none thing is certain - it simply doesn't deserve to be the highest grossing film\never. OK, so it's not a bad film, but it's a long way from being a classic (good\nacting, direction, plot and script would\nhelp). Even technically, it's no master-piece, with the little figures running\naround on the back of the boat are\nhardly state-of-the-art CGI.

    "content": "18\nArts 19 October 1998\nADDRESSING THE CENTURY: 100 YEARS OF ART AND FASHION\nHayward Gallery, South Bank\nH ot on the heels of London FashIon Week comes this exhibition\nexploring\nthe relationship\nbetween the intermingling worlds of\nart and fashion during the course of\nthe twentieth century. Including over\n250 works ranging\nfrom actual costumes to films, photographs and\nillustrations, the collection emphasises\nthe aesthetic component of fashion.\nThe five galleries are arranged\nin chronological\norder: 1/ Decoration\n- The New Century,- \\\n21 Function - The 1\nPost-war Years; 3/ 1\nFantasy - Dreams in\nI lard Times; 4/ Performance - The\nYears of Re-invention and 5/ Convergence - Post-modern\nTimes. As with most social phenomena,\nthe milestones of fashion often coincide with cultural movements and surges\nof political upheaval. During the feminist\nexplosion at the\nturn of the century\nfor instance, the\nFrench c out urie r Paul Poiret revolutionised the style of\nemancipated\nfemales by discarding the dreaded\ncorset.\nOver the years,\nthe accent in fashion has shifted dramatically from the\nelegant and decorative to the functional, from the\npractical to the original yet blatantly\nun wearable. Nowadays, modern artists\nrelish the \"shock\nfactor\" their clothes\ninspire. In order to\nstand out from the\ncrowd, designers\nare continually\nsearching for innovative materials from\nwhich to mould their obscure and extravagant creations. Honeycomb shoes,\nP1 porcelain waistcoats, stainless steel\nevening gowns, rubber-band dresses,\nplastic-wrapping\nraincoats and JM.\nhuman hair necklaces are just the tip\nof the iceberg\nwhen it comes to\nthe weird and wonderful objects on\ndisplay.\nIn an effort to\nencourage visitor\nparticipation, the\norganisers have set\nup an interactive\nDressing Room. The\npublic is given a rare opportunity to\ntry on specially commissioned garments and\naccessories conceived by talented\nstudents on the\nfashion scene.\nSigns proudly\nannouncing\n\"Touching allowed!\"\ncertainly make fot a welcome and\nrefreshing alternative to the traditional\nattitude of museums.\nThe exhibition does not pretend or\neven attempt to portray an exhaustive\n[t Twi Jill ii1 history of these\n. \" _ twin industries,\n\u2022\n' focussing instead\non the highlights of\nthe collaboration\nbetween artists and\ndesigners. So, if you\nsecretly consider\nyourself a budding\nJohn Galliano, feel\nlike following in the\nfootsteps of Vivienne Westwood or\nsimply show an\ninterest in fashion,\nthen the I lay ward Gallery is well-worth\na visit.\n/ l elena Until nth January\nNearest tube:\nWaterloo/Embank1 ment\nAdmission: \u00a36, concessions \u00a33.50\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm(8 pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays)\nAUBREY BEARDSLEY\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nT he first few prints and carica tut es featured in this exhibition reveal\nthat Aubrey Eieardsley was an elegant man with a definitively artistic hair-style. I lis brief period of creative\nprecedence began in 1892 when Beardsley was just 20 years old. Over five years.\nhe generated an urbane style which was\nso inspirational that it was re-awakened\nas 1960's chic. The exhibition charters the\nlife of Beardsley following the progression of his work and relating the influence imposed on him by current affairs.\nAs a newcomer to London, Beardsley had to balance an office job alongside his real passion and as a result\nworked late into the night, sketching\nand hatching by the light of a candle. The\nabsence of colourful stimulus is reflected\nin his pieces that are generally neutral;\nblack ink on white paper. However, the\nintricacy of the fine lines which assemble\nmany of the exhibits are far from bland.\nThe vibrancy of the flowers in Siegfried\nAct 2 and his ability to fill a scene with tiny\ndetails allow you to absorb more than the\ndepicted situation from his work. It is\nlikely that it was this capacity which\ninduced many publishers such as L.J. M. Dent to call on him to illustrate their\nmagazines, books and posters.\nBeardsley, on the other hand, liked\nto view situations from an unusual per-spec ti ve. One of his earlier works, The\nEntombment, depicts the body of Christ\nbeing taken down from the cross, an\nevent that is rarely considered by other\nmodern artists. I lis appreciation of traditional Japanese art is also shown and\nthe flowing lines of oriental elegance\nappear as a natural evolution for his\nstyle.\nBeardsley became restless with his\nmythical subjects and in an attempt to\npacify him, Dent brought out the BonMot series, small books of illustrations\nand anecdotes. Yet this only served to\nfuel Beardsley's desire to unravel the\nsociety of his time, I le found similar aspirations in the intellect of Oscar Wilde\nand they struck up a friendship when\nBeardsley illustrated Wilde's book\nSalome Later, by means of a more daring publisher, they worked together on\na magazine called The Yellow Book\nwhose contents sparked outrage\namongst the upper classes due to their\nsuggestions of society's decadence, this\nsatire seems quite harmless now, in the\npresent climate of free expression and,\nin fact, protests were not heard when, in\none issue, Beardsley submitted work\nunder an assumed name. Perhaps some\nof the scandal surrounding these designs\nwas caused by reputation rather than\ncontent.\nWhen Wilde was sent to prison,\nBeardsley experienced a time of extreme\nhardship, amplified by the progression of\nthe consumption, which finally ended his\nlife. After several other projects Beardsley began a period in which his work took\non agent let tone, using washes to offset the harsh ink lines, lie also completed some ornate baroque studies.\nThese are remarkably detailed considering the state of his health at the time. The\nfinal exhibits prove that right up until his\nvery last days, Beardsley was generating\nfresh ideas and this makes his premature\ndeath at 25 years of age such a tragedy.\nDemelza\nUntil 10th January\nNearest tube: walk, it's right next to the\ncollege.\nAdmission: \u00a35, FREE for students\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.30 pm( Mondays from 12pm) "

A liberal sprinkling of potash in the spring and dead\nhead carefully. I'm sorry, wrong column.\nIt is a little known fact that I am the gardening correspondent for The Cleethorpes Evening Argus, and all this talk of\nflowerbeds is getting me confused. I shall say little more of it, since it has\nmostly been said by others. I low ever, there is some scope for recouping the\ndisgracefully large cost when I ler Majesty\nhas departed. The traffic in South Ken is,\nof course, dreadful, and it seems fair\nthat the College should do its bit to alleviate the congestion. Season ticket loans\nare an excellent idea, but other forms of\ntransport should be encouraged. I doubt\nI am the first to suggest it, but the\nflowerbed could be grassed, thus affording the perfect venue for tethering\nhorses. It has already been suggested\nthat IC employs a lot of cowboys, so the\ntake up for such a scheme should be\nhigh. Environmentally sound - the Rector's roses would come on a treat - and\nforward thinking. The best traditions of\nImperial. Alternatively, we could address\nanother problem, while still maintaining\na splash of colour. A vegetable patch. Carrots, cauliflowers and runner beans\nwould look superb against the backdrop\nof the library, and the produce upon harvest could be used by Catering in order\nthat their catastrophically bad losses be\nmitigated. A lovely idea, I hear you cry,\nbut on quiet reflection it has a weakness.\nTo make headway on the par lou s state\nof Catering's finances would probably\nrequire the conversion of the Il arlington sports ground into a market garden cum\ncattle ranch. Never mind.\nEurotrash\nWe, or rather the rest of Europe, have less\nthan 90 days until the birth of EMU.\nSome may greet this with wide-eyed\nanticipation, miffed that the UK won't be\nat the christening. As regular readers will\nknow, I am probably not in that group.\nFrom the days of the ill-fated ERM, which\nled to this country's severest recession\nsince the 30s, the whole idea of a European dream founded on a single currency has filled me with unease. The\ntwo previous attempts to unify Europe, by\nNapoleon and Il it ler, were not without\ntheir problems, but some feel that having a crack at the old idea by peaceful\nmeans may be more successful. The two\nobvious questions are: why do it and\nwill it work? The first seems to have been\ndodged by many involved, which is wor-Simon Baker\nVoice of\nr ying since it is clearly linked to the sec-on d. France and Germany do have an\nanswer to the\nfirst point. The\nproblem is\nthat they are\nnot so much\ndifferent as\ntotally unrelated. The\nFrench have,\nsince the\n1960s, had a powerful\ndesire to create a currency\nto rival the\ndollar, which\nwould give\nthem a greater say in\nworld affairs\nwhile reducing the rote of\nUncle Sam.\nThe proposal\nwas never sullied with anything so base as economic\narguments as is the norm in Gallic poli-tics. The Germans' motives are more\naltruistic. They believe that surrendering\nsome of the sovereignty inherent in having the principal currency of Europe will\nfurther reinforce their desire to co-exist\npeacefully with their neighbours. While\nhighly laudable, it is still predominantly\npolitical. So we have the two senior partners suggesting a complete overhaul of\nthe European economy for reasons that\nhave little to do with national economic\nwellbeing. Then we have the Italians. To\nthe Bundesbank's credit, they have made\nno secret of their desire to admit Italy\nwhen, and only when, I lei! freezes over.\nOnly last week the Italian Prime Minister\nwas forced to resign in a confidence\ndebate after the Communists refused to\naccept an adherence to tight fiscal control post-1999. Once they're in the Euro\nclub, they plan to get straight back to\ntheir old ways, which have been so thoroughly discredited.\nThe whole project has become politic is ed. The French want a say in how the\nCentral Bank operates, which makes a mockery of it, and bodes very ill for the\nstability of the currency. But even if the\nFrench don't upset the apple-cart, will it\nwork? This is where we get to the heart\nof the matter. Barely a day goes by without a plea from Britain's manufacturers'\nto cut interest rates, yet the Bank of England have been reluctant to act until\nrecently because of rising wages and\nstrong consumer demand in the South.\nIf we cannot set an interest rate that\nmeets the needs of London and Manchester, how on earth can it work across\nthe whole of continental Europe? I he\nIrish, for example, will have to take 2.5%\noff their rate,\nat a time\nwhen they\nshould be raising rates to\nstop inflation.\nIf they are not\ncareful, the\nIrish economy\nwill implode.\nNot only will\ngovernments\nlose the ability to set their\ninterest rates,\nbut their freedom to set\ntaxes and\nexpenditure\nwill diminish.\nThis is already\nhappening.\nWhen Gordon\nBrown wished\nto repeal VAT\non fuel, he was told that this was illegal\nunder European law. The French have\nbeen getting twitch y for some years\nabout so-called 'fiscal dumping.' Some\nmight prefer the term 'fiscal prudence',\nsince they are terrified that their excessive tax regime will persuade French\ncompanies to move to lower tax countries in Euroland. Rather than put their\nhouse in order, they would prefer that\nthis is banned. The problem in Britain is\nthat the arguments have concentrated\non political issues such as losing the\npound.

I refer to myself for I have just\nresigned from the post of VP(Education\n& Welfare).\nMy reasons for this are as follows;\n1) I am fed up with the way in which\nmy CCU was run - with no offence\nintended to the VPs but Will and Bob arc\ntwo ICSF members with very little outside\ncontact.\n2) I need to get a good degree (as\na disabled person it is harder for me to\nget work) and the Union takes too much\nof my time.\nNow I am not saying that the CCUs\nshould be abolished, just reformed a bit.\nAll that CCUs should do is provide ents\nfor students. All people 'care' about\ntoday is IC as a whole and their depart-men ts.I have had discussions with many\npeople about this and have the following plans.\nAll the leaders of the departmental\nsocieties should group together to provide events for students, such as nights\nout - paintball, etc. Welfare should be left\nto ICU and the new fifth sabbatical -under this should be a set of dep-reps\nand welfare officers who have had some\nwelfare training and advice.\nI leave the floor open to debate...\nDouglas Graham\nPhysics UG II\nex RCSU VP(E&W)/ Acting President\nThe Voice of Reason\n(repeat)\nDear Ed,\nDo my tired old eyes deceive me? Can\nit be true that that leviathan of student\njournalism, Simon Baker, is recycling tired\nold columns? I refer, of course, to said\ncorespondent's dreadful cut-and-paste\njob in his first essay under your blossoming command. There are those of us\nwith longer memories, filled not with trifles such as chemistry, who can place at\nleast two paragraphs from the fresher s' piece that appeared verbatim in its equivalent last year. Perhaps it was not the\nwork of the real Simon Baker? An\ninspired computer programme generating reams of self-indulgent dross without\nthe worry of a decent PhD to distract it\nfrom its deadlines? Why of course not,\nno \"AI-SB\" could be perfect. But where\nis the real Simon Baker? I feel that we\nought to be told.\nYours with genuine concern,\nSimon Baker's Number One Fan,\nNo Fixed Abode\nThe real Simon Baker has been spotted\non several occasions this term, mostly In\nSouthside Bar. As for the use of a com-put er, don't you think If I had written an\n'Al-SB' program it would have cut and\npasted with more subtlety? - Ed\nDeadline for letters is\n12noon Wednesday.\nLetters may be edited\nfor length, but will not\nbe altered in any other\nway.

No\nlonger must I fill a half-page editorial\nwith my complaints and gripes about\nthe world - a mere three columns is all\nthat stands between me and a finished\nthird issue! My thanks go out to all the\nFelix team who have made this week so\nmuch easier than the last few, especially\nDavid Roberts (for being editor of all-things-no-onc-c lse wants-to-touch), and\nJoel Lewis (for allowing me to get a quick\npint or two in on Wednesday evening).\nNot only does this state of affairs allow\nmc lo grab back some of my limited\nsocial life, it also means that you hear less\nfrom me and more from normal (i.e. not\ngraduated - ha ha!) students. Still, it's5am and there's space to fill, so...\nDoes anyone care?\nThe answer is almost certainly no but,\nnever one to be cynical, I 'll persevere\nanyway. As Felix went to print, there\nwere still no candidates for DP(C&S), and\nfrom what I hear some of the Council\npositions weren't exactly over subscribed\neither. I would be hypocritical if I said I was any different from most IC students\n- two years ago I didn't care about Union\npolitics, and hardly noticed when elections came around. The biggest effect\nit had on me was the lack of Lnts on hustings night in dB's. But surely some\nmore mature (i.e. less socially active\nand/or CV developing) students want to\nget involved? I did, and now I get paid\nto sit here in the early morning... okay, I can see your point.\nSex sex sex!\nNow I 've got your attention... I honestly\ndo want to talk about sex. It seems to\nbe about this time, when the term settles down, that first years (no longer\nfresher s) have to accept that Imperial is\nnot a good place to find a partner. I say\npartner because I feel that this is just as\ntrue for women as men at IC, although\nI'm sure plenty of guys out there would\ndisagree. There's not a lot of point sitting in your room/bar/ct c complaining\nabout il, though - Cameron Diaz is hardly\nlikely to turn up in Linstead Hall one\nevening. My patronising bit of advice this\nweek is for all those 'single and not liking it' people - get out and enjoy life or\nstop whining. As for me? Oh dear, I seem to have run out of space...
