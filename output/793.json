Also tonight the\nblues influenced Screaming Blue\nMessiahs, currently in the charts\nsinging about the Flintstones, are\nplaying at the Town and Country\nClub, while the thumping thrash outfit\nStump, play at ULU.\nOn Saturday, Balaam and the\nAngel\u2014heavy metal come-goth-come hippy, play the Astoria. They are\nsupported by Ghost Dance\u2014ultra goths from the old Sisters of Mercy\nwho aren't in the new Sisters of Mercy or the Mission, who sing, somewhat\ntediously, about death, gloom and\nevil.\nOn Sunday, the Red Wedge gig at\nthe Mean Fiddler is for me\novershadowed by the Godfathers at\nthe Town and Country Club. No\nnonsense, rock hard and with no trace\nof metal, on stage these guys are\ncharacterised by menacing stares and\nwild guitar frenzies. Their music has\nbeen a likened to a whirlpool of old\nCult, Clash and old Idol. They'll be\npromoting their new album, Birth\nSchool, Work, Death, and expect to\nhear the single of that name several\ntimes in the course of the evening!\nAlbum Review: Red Lorry Yellow\nLorry, Smashed Hits\nThe compilation album by the band\nwho are the answer to my (musical)\ndreams. To give you an idea: take the\nold Sisters of Mercy without the mask\nof plan ge and chorus to hid behind;\nthe deep, rolling c ovals of Andrew\nEldritch without the tongue-in-cheek\nlyrics. Add the anger of the Jesus and\nMary Chain as they used to be. And\nthe hard, no-compromise lyrics\nre men is cent of The Godfathers. Need\nI say more? What more can someone\nwho is not\u2014contrary to rumour\u2014a goth, but is more goth than anything\nelse, want? (OK, apart from that!)\nThis album contains all their better-known releases\u2014such as Beating my\nHead; Hollow Eyes and Chance. Not\nas earthy as The Godfathers, more\nwitty than The Sisters, and more\ntalented that J& MC, The Lorries\nshould go far. This should appeal to\nall lovers of goth, indie and hard rock.\nGet it!\nThere are four first division games on\nin London this weekend, so it gives\na better choice than usual. All games\nare on Saturday 13th February with\n3pm kick offs (unless otherwise\nstated).\nArsenal vs Luton Town\nHighbury (Arsenal tube)\nThe Gunners entertain a side that hit\nOxford for 7 last week, even though\nthey conceded 4! Arsenal played the\nright sort of game at Everton last\nweek in the Littlewoods Cup SemiFinal and came away with a slender\nwin due to the fact that Everton can't put a penalty away. Man of that match\nTony Adams looked solid and a good\nprospect to take on the captaincy of\nEngland in the future. Luton, the T don't want any away fans because our\nChairman is a Tory MP and likes to\ncrawl to Thatcher' team have some\ngood players and lie in the right side\nof the Division. The Stein brothers,\nMark and Brian, Mick Harford and\nSteve Foster have helped to mould\nLuton into a force to be reckoned\nwith. I think a draw is likely but\nArsenal could nick it with a bit of\nluck.\nCharlton vs Wimbledon\nSelhurst Park (Norwood Junction BR)\nA London derby between two of the\nmost poorly supported Division One\nclubs. There won't be much of a crowd but this doesn't prevent the\nmatch from throwing up a little\naction. Charlton are still rooted to the\nfoot of the table and can't really see\nthem moving up. Wimbledon are\nhaving another good season and\nBobby Gould has taken over where\nDave Bassett left off. Fashanu is on\nthe verge of the England squad and\ncould provide the punch to give the\nDons the three points.\n1 i r.^,m_ Chelsea vs Manchester United\nStamford Bridge (Fulham\nBroadway tube)\nThis is the repeat of the recent FA\nCup 4th Round tie with the Blues\nbeing home this time and eager to\nseek revenge for the Reds 2-0 victory.\nChelsea have not won in the league\nsince October 31st and have fallen to\n14th in the league. They came back\nfrom 2-0 down at Forest last week but\nwere unfortunate to lose 3-2. United\nscraped a10 victory last week, due\nto a4 th minute goal, but Brian\nMcClair, as I have said once before,\nis having a good time at Old Trafford\nand Olsen still has magical skills. It\nhas been 30 years since Munich and\nthe days of the Busby's Babes, will\nthe Reds ever see days like that again?\nThe loss of Duncan Edwards, the best\nEnglish footballer of all time, and 7\nothers was movingly shown last\nweekend on TV and showed how the\nfans had so much passion for the\ngame.

    "content": "Letters\nMining House will\nbe unsociable next\nyear\u2014official\nDear Judith,\nRecent events in Mining House have brought to the fore\na lot of ill feeling that has been building up for quite a while. Miss Brown, the warden, has insisted that choosing\nre-apps was entirely her own choice, even though College\noffices said that she simply had the power to veto any\napplications. Consequently, a committee was chosen to\npick the re-apps, and Miss Brown then proceeded to ignore\ntheir choices, submitting a list of next year's re-apps which\nincluded people that had not even been put forward by\nthe committee. When asked why she had chosen one of\nthese people, Miss Brown commented that 'he does what\nthe warden and sub-wardens tell him to do'. From this,\nit is obvious that Miss Brown intends to surround herself\nwith yes-men for next year, simply in order to make her\njob as easy as possible. The re-app forms insisted that 're-apps will be chosen according to their contributions to their\nhouse', yet Miss Brown seems to have conveniently\nadjusted this to suit her own purposes. She has picked the\npeople she likes, or to be more accurate the people who\naren't going to kick up a fuss about anything.\nMiss Brown has never been slow to admit her great\ndislike for the Mining House social club of 'The Diggers'.\n(Is this because the club has successfully run itself for\neleven years and she has been unable to manipulate or\ninterfere with its activities?) Diggers is a tradition. It\nsurvived for nine years before Miss Brown, and hopefully\nwill go on for many years after she has gone. However,\nin choosing next year's re-apps, Miss Brown has\ncon veni end yom mitte d Adrian Lewis, who, with great\nrespect to next year's president, would have undoubtedly\nmade the best president. The reason given by Miss Brown\nwas that she doesn't 'like' him. She doesn't even know\nhim. He is a sociable person, therefore by Miss Brown's book, he must be trouble. This simply highlights the\nattitude of our Warden. On the first day of arriving at the\nhouse, she took a dislike to me because I smoke. This\npetty, almost childish, attitude does get tiresome. If I disliked people for having silly haircuts, I would have very\nfew friends. However, before all this sound like a case\nof sour grapes, I must point out that even though I myself\ndid reapply to the house, I withdrew my application,\nmainly because I didn't want to play any part in this whole\nfarce.\nThroughout the year, Miss Brown has stuck to her\nattitudes of treating the whole of the house as school\nchildren. She is afraid to let the house run itself, not\nbecause she is afraid that discipline would be lost, but\nbecause she knows that the house would probably do a much better job of it. Understandably, the sub-wardens\nare behind her thick and thin. They can't be blamed. They\nhave got cheap accommodation, and a relaxed life. They\nare never going to put their head on the line simply because\nthey have a lot to lose. Miss Brown has now made sure\nthat next year the once most sociable house in Evelyn\nGardens will become the dullest ever. It suits her per fec dy. What she forgets is that she is getting free accommodation,\nwhich is being paid for by us. She has to learn that with\na happy house there will always be hiccups, but what she\nwants is a house full of bookworms who make things very\neasy. Not only does College need a big rethink in how\nto handle re-applicants, but also in how they choose their\nwardens. Miss Brown may be wonderful at book work, but as far as the atmosphere in Mining House goes,\nsomething certainly stinks. This isn't the first, and most\ncertainly won't be the last complaint about Miss Brown,\nbut for how long can College keep a Tow profile on the\nmatter.\nYours sincerely,\nMr B Basma.\nDo college Playfair?\nOn entering the Lyon Playfair Library last night I was\nasked to produce identification. I asked the reason why\nand was told that monitoring was going on to determine\nhow many students from other colleges used the library,\nwith a view to only letting Imperial College students use\nthe building in future.\nI would like to bring the following points to your\nattention.\nFirstly, it must be noted that Imperial College is part\nof London University. One attraction of London\nUniversity is the availability of large information resources\nthroughout London. Furthermore, due to the acute\naccommodation crisis in London many students live a long\nway from their respective colleges and it may often be\nconvenient for them to study at a library nearer their\nlodgings.\nThe banning of non-Imperial College students from\nImperial College libraries, as well as being unfair on these\nstudents, could also lead to reciprocal bans being\nintroduced by other colleges on Imperial College students,\nthereby having a bad effect on the students the ban was\ntrying to protect.\nIf the library is suffering from lack of books or space\n(which one assumes it must be else these measures\nwouldn't be considered) it must be noted that banning\npeople from the library does not create more books, or\nmore space, but merely cuts back people's access to\neducation.\nRather than Imperial College libraries withdrawing into\nthemselves, to protect their own members, it would be\nbetter if the libraries joined with other London University\nlibraries and institutions in a concerted campaign for more\nmoney for all aspects of education, as well as a better\nsharing of their resources.\nAlthough monitoring student usage of the library is not\nthe same is actually banning certain people, it can only\nbe. seen as the first step along the way.\nI hope students at IC will note these points and protest\naccordingly.\nRoss Popper (IC student)\nAre they related?\nDear Judith,\nI think it only fair to thank David Leigh for last week's kind letter, I found his perception into IC Radio quite\nastounding, since he is only a listener. He is right in his\nassumption that the station is quite staid in its approach.\nHowever, with the current movement of people the station\nwill, in the next couple of years, develop into an important\npart of the IC community. So stay tuned.\nHowever, I'm sure David was as dismayed as I was to\nread the headline 'sycophantic drivel'. I'm sure when\nFELIX receives its own appreciation letter for the year,\nlike IC Radio has, its headline will not be along the same\ntactless lines.\nYours sincerely,\nSpenser Lane (Mat Sci 1).\nSmall Ads\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022 Environmental Week is one its way!\n\u2022 Quiz machine addicts require details\nof machine locations.

    "content": "1 I W~^\"**^4r \u2122~*\u00bbThe Union reorganisation: the new need\nfor self-motivated, imaginative candidates\nThe twenty fifth of\nJanuary saw the the\nintroduction of sweeping\nchanges in the structure\nof Imperial College\nUnion. After a protracted debate\nCouncil decided to\napprove a number of\nnew job descriptions for\nsabbaticals and\npermanent staff which\nwould radically change\ntheir role in the Union.\nIn a nutshell, the changes will shift\nthe burden of administration onto the\npermanent staff leaving the\nsabbaticals free to become more\ndirectly involved in student matters.\nThe pivotal change has been the\nintroduction of a full-time Union\nManager to take over much of the\nwork currently carried out by the\nDeputy President. Basically this\ninvolves looking after and improving\nthe Union Building and the Union\ntransport facilities. There is every\nreason to assume that a full time\nmanager could do much to make the\nUnion Building more useful and more\nattractive to students . The question\nremains, however, can the Union\nafford to employ another full-time\nstaff member? There will be a two\nyear period of grace during which the\nCollege will meet half of the\nManager's salary; beyond this, the\npost will have to become self-financing. Hopefully the manager will\nattract enough business to the the\nUnion Bar, Snack Bar and other\nUnion facilities to cover his own\nwages. If he is unsuccessful then it is\nlikely that the Union outlets will have\nto increase their prices and this\nunderlines the importance of having\na competent employee in the post. So\nwhere does this leave the Deputy\nPresident? The DP will still remain\nresponsible for overseeing the\nfinancial estimates of the Unions\nclubs, the security of the Union\nBuilding and representing the Union\non disciplinary meetings. The fact that\nhe or she will no longer be directly\nresponsible for the upkeep of the\nUnion Building will mean a substantial reduction in the DP's work\nload. This will be compensated for by\nthe DP taking responsibility for two\nof the following areas; academic\naffairs, accommodation and housing,\nathletics, overseas students,\npostgraduate affairs and welfare. The\nUnion President will be responsible\nfor the remaining five areas.\nThe job of the Honorary Secretary\nhas been described as a a job which\ncould easily be performed by a monkey with ages tet ner. It is the Hon\nSee's job which has undergone the\nmost complete change-around. In his\nor her new role, the Hon Sec will be\nin charge of events. The word event\nwill cover everything from running\ncampaigns, Freshers Fair,\nCommemoration Balls, and\nentertainments events. The job will\nstill retain responsibility for running\nelections and organising social\ncolours awards. To be dispensed with\nwill be the Hon See's minute taking\nrole, the responsibility for\nmaintaining the constitutions of Union\ncommittees, clubs and societies,\nrep on sibi lit y for insurance, parking\npermits and the production of Union\ncards. The job of organising\nreciprocal membership of other\ninstitutions will be taken over by the\nPresident.\nThe President's job description has\nbeen tightened up from the previously\nvague 'the President shall have\noverall responsibility for the effective\norganisation of the Union' to a much\nmore specific breakdown of the job's requirements. As mentioned earlier\nthe President will take on five areas\nof r eleven ce to students and is\nmandated to research and keep up-to-date information in these areas and to\ninform the UGM of developments. In\naddition the President is directed to\nsit on a number of named committees\nincluding being present as an observer\non Governing Body and the Finance\nand Executive Committee, the two top\nCollege committees.\nThe newly created Constitution and\nPolicy Officer has generated a good\ndeal of controversy. Essentially the\nholder of this post will take on the job\nof UGM and Council Chairman, with\nthe additional task of ensuring that the\nUnion officers, including sabbaticals\nare performing their jobs correctly.\nThe Officer will have no powers in\nthis respect but will be able to report\nlazy officers to the UGM. In addition,\nthe Constitution and Policy Officer\nwill sit on the Governing Body and\nthe Finance and Executive\nCommittees as an observer, where his\nor her role will be to ensure that the\nUnion President is representing the\nUnion's policy to the Governing Body\nor Finance & Executive. Other duties\nwill include updating the Unions\nConstitution and pointing out matters\nwhich may require policy to be\nchanged to the Union Executive.\nWell, the burning question on\neverybody's lips is 'what implications\nwill this have for those people\nconsidering standing as sabbaticals for\nnext year?' It is clear that these new\njob descriptions will require\ncandidates with different qualities.\nThe. President and the Deputy\nPresident will no longer be elected on\ntheir ability to administer; their ability\nto represent students will become\nmuch more important. There is a good deal of scope in the job\ndescriptions for holders these posts to\nput a lot of work into affairs of\nconcern to students and there is\nequally a lot of scope for them to sit\nback and do nothing. Good candidates\nfor these posts will need to be very\nself-motivated and they must also\nhave the imagination to take action for\nthemselves in their areas of\nresponsibility. They will need the\nability to go out and research areas\nsuch as ac como dati on problems; they\nmust be up to date with the latest\ngovernment policies, if they affect\nstudents for example.\nProspective Events Hon Sees will\nbe elected on their ability to organise.\nThey will need to be able to motivate\npeople and have a proven ability to\npublicise events properly. There is no\nquestion that the post has become\nassociated with the ICU Ents\nconsortium and one can for see Ents\nbecoming a route for prospective\nsabbaticals. In conclusion, for those\nof you thinking of standing next week\nyou should bear in mind that the jobs\nhave changed completely. There is no\npoint standing because you think you\ncan do the job better than this year's sabbaticals. Do you think you have\nthe ability to conform with the new\nrequirements? If you do, then go\nahead and stand for a post and good\nluck\u2014you'll need it; election\ncampaigns are never pleasant.\nHow to win Are you an ego maniac? Are you\nlooking for a year off from academic\nlife, or a year's grace before braving\nthe big wide world? Most\nimportantly, are you a mug? If you\ncan answer 'yes' to these questions,\nyou should consider a one-year career\nas a sabbatical.\nThe first problem facing all\nprospective sabbaticals is how to get\nthe job. Usually this involves fighting\nan election, unless you can no b ble the\nopposition beforehand.\nFirst you have to put your name up\non the appropriate paper on the Union\nnoticeboard. This is situated on the\nright of the central staircase entrance\nto the Union Building. You will also\nneed twenty people who think you're\ncapable of the job, to sign the paper,\nand a proposer who is prepared to\nstand up in front of an audience of\nhundreds (well, at least twenty) and\nsay nice things about you. It shouldn't be too hard to find a suitable person\nas (a) there are plenty of weirdo\nexhibitionists in the College and (b) everyone thinks you're a really\nwonderful person, don't they?\nAs soon as papers come down, but\nnot before, you are allowed to start\nyour publicity campaign: plastering\nCollege bars, walkways, common\nrooms and toilets with posters,\n'providing enough leaflets to paper a small ballroom, speaking to lecture\ntheatres (preferably full of students),\nkissing babies...anything you can\nthink of, as long as it's within the\nelection publicity rules. Honorary\nSecretary Chas Jackson should have\na copy of these, for your inspection.\nAt Hustings you are given two\nminutes for you and your proposer to\nconvince everybody that you are the\nbest thing since sliced bread.\nMeanwhile the people you and your\nopponents have planted, plus a few\nrandom s, should submit questions\nwhich will be put to the candidates\nafter the speeches. When you are\npreparing your questions, don't forget\nthey must apply equally to all\ncandidates. That's the rule.\nThere are numerous ways to cheat:\nbribery is extremely easy and fairly\ncheap. You can, of course, put\npromises of how you will make life\nwonderful in your manifesto, but I'm talking about straight cash (or beer)\nin hard bribery here. Voting is easy\nto rig. You can vote in each\ndepartment, as long as you have\nenough current Union cards (easy to\nobtain), and unless someone twigs\nand asks for a register check, no one\nwill know.\nMay the best person win!\nFELIX Friday February 12th1988> "

    "content": "UNDERBID THE\nMICRO g^ SCO DC\nby Steve Black\nMedical bloodsuckers\nare back\nBack in the days before cure-alls such\nas Aspirin and Valium, leeches were\nused to treat just about every disease.\nA good dose of bleeding was thought\nto cure anything.\nOur enlightened medical\nestablishment thought they had done\naway with such barbaric treatments.\nBut the leeches turned out to have\nsome clever solutions to some modern\nmedical problems. Indeed a company\ncalled Biopharm (UK) has been set up\nin Wales to farm leeches and it sells\nrange of chemicals that many medics\nnow want to get their hands on.\nLeeches don't like their dinner to\nbe lumpy, so they have developed\nanti-clotting agents which are present\nin their saliva. One of the compounds,\ncalled Hirudin, is very good at\nstopping clots forming in people, and\nit is being investigated as a possible\ntreatment of certain forms of heart\ndisease and post-operative trauma.\nHirudin can be extracted from the\nleech saliva, which can be extracted\nm. These slimy little bloodsuckers are smarter than the average chemist.\ntens of thousands of them around the\nworld.\nWhen it comes to biochemistry the\nleeches are smart little buggers. In the\nprocess of becoming better\nbloodsuckers, th gy have developed a from the leeches by milking them in\nspecial sausage skins (live hosts are\nnot required).\nLeeches have also developed a chemical that inhibits Elastase, a sort\nof waste disposal enzyme. Elastase is\nnormally produced after injury, when\nit attacks the structural proteins in\ndamaged cells thereby helping to clear\nup the useless waste material.\nHowever, sometimes the system goes\nwrong and the Elastase attacks healthy\ntissue (this happens in the lung disease\nemphysema). It may prove useful to\ntreat such diseases with the leech-derived inhibitor.\nTo cap all this, the smart and slimy\nlittle bloodsuckers have developed a spreading agent to spread all their\nother chemicals evenly over the neat\nstar-shaped wound that they cause.\nThis compound is called Orgelase. It\nworks by sticking to h yalu roni c acid\n(a sort of polymer is ed sugar) that acts\nas a glue to stick cells together.\nOrgelase is highly fussy about exactly\nwhat it sticks to and can therefore be\nused as a test fo the cellular glue. This\nhas proved useful in research into\nsome diseases of connective tissue\n(such as rheumatoid arthritis) where\nthere appears to be an excess of the\nglue in the joints.\nBiopharm is doing research on\nseveral species of leech to see if they\ncan find any more useful chemicals.\nThe research is paid for by milking\nthe leeches for the chemicals they\nalready know about.\nBut they are also selling live leeches\nto surgeons. The leeches can be used\nto neatly remove blood clots from\nunderneath skin grafts. They can also\nbe used to remove excess blood in\nmicrosurgery. At the moment this\npractice is popular only in the USA,\nbut I'm doing my best to stay out of\nhospital just in case. (Chemistry in\nBritain 26 p ll( Jan 1988), New\nScientist 4th February 1988 p43) Editorial\nIf Kenneth Baker ever makes it to Prime Minister, he is going to do it over\nthe dead bodies of a lot of university academics. His Education reform bill\nhas some of them foaming at the mouth in fury. It threatens to wash away\nthe sacred cornerstones of academic independence. University bigwigs are\nganging up to mount a campaign of opposition. But how justified are they\nin opposing Baker's reforms?\nBaker wants to abolish academic tenure. Tenure prevents universities from\nsacking anyone except for gross professional misconduct (for example,\nthrowing the Rector off the top of Sherfield for not giving their department\nenough money). Tenure is supposed to allow people to do unfashionable\nresearch and to prevent political interference in their work. Such freedom\nfrom outside interference is supposedly essential to the pursuit of knowledge.\nThe second and more important clause in the Baker Bill is about university\nindependence. Baker wants to be able to impose his direct will on the\nuniversities, who are at present nominally independent (clearly most of their\nmoney comes from the Government, but it is up to the universities to choose\nwhat to do with it). He wants to be able to force universities to close or merge\nspecific departments and to sack specific staff and so on. He cannot do this\nat the moment. Academics find the new clause highly threatening. A future\ngovernment could sack people it didn't like. Pure research might be abandoned\nfor short term gain, leading, ultimately, to the destruction of the whole research\nbase.\nHowever, academics' protests might be listened to more carefully if the\nuniversities had shown any willingness to put their own house in order.\nTenure can be abused. There are still some people who treat tenure as an\nexcuse to be bad lecturers or not to do decent research. Many other academics\nmake poor use of the resources they have: many senior scientists couldn't administer an aspirin, never mind a department, but they still rise to positions\nof responsibility on the basis of their career in research. When money is short,\nrational ising decisions are often avoided because of academic infighting and\nrivalry. Lecturers often resist proper training in teaching methods because\nthey want to devote all their time to research. People fail their PhDs because\ntheir supervisors don't know how to manage a research group efficiently. Good\nideas go to waste because academics take so little interest in the outside world\nthey can't see the applications of their work.\nIt could be argued that academics, because of their all too common isolation\nfrom the outside world, have failed to appreciate or fulfil their duty to society.\nSo while Kenneth Baker may well be about to make a terrible mess of the\nuniversities, the academics are unlikely to do much better if their past record\nis anything to go by.\n/ wrote this when I was in a bad mood after my computer broke down, so\nit may sound rather opinionated. However, it is intended to stimulate discussion\non the issues raised by the Baker Bill, so I want to hear what others think, j Please send articles, comments or abuse to me at the FELIX Office. Indeed,\nthis goes for anything that appears on this page.\n6 Friday February 12th1988 FELIX\n\n"

At Tuesday's Union\nGeneral Meeting held in the Junior\nCommon Room, a motion was passed\nsupporting the London School of\nEconomics Union in their fight to get\ntheir College to d is invest in South\nAfrica.\nThe motion was passed by a majority, despite an attempt by its\nopposition to call quorum before it\nwas debated.

He\nmentioned it to his fellow IC Radio\nmembers who thought that it would\nbe an excellent way to raise money\nfor Comic Relief last Friday. They\nthen approached Ian with a short list\nof silly names which he could choose\nfrom. They were Phil HarmonicOrchestra, Sydney Opera-House,\nAlbert Memorial and Sydney\nHarbour-Bridge. Syd says that his\nchoice of name was influenced by the\nfact that his birthday falls on Australia\nDay and that this year is Australia's bi-cent eni al. It was decided that a sum of \u00a3500\nwould have to be raise for Comic\nRelief before he agreed to change his\nname.

    "content": "\u2022 WHAT IS THE SECRET of the\nmysterious building work currently in\nprogress down in the Linstead\nextent ion basement? The latest\nrumour circulating Princes Gardens\nis that an extra floor is being built to\naccommodate a greenhouse. Not for\nacademic purposes, we hear, but for\nthe wife of David Evans, head of\nCollege's Estates Section.\n\u2022 UNION BAR BOD Adrian Jelly'\nJohnson proved that you can crash a Union van before going into the bar\nearlier this week. Jelly was overtaking\na car on Cromwell Road and hit the\ncar travelling in front in the lane he\nwas entering. The bonnet is a write-off. But just why was Jelly driving a Union van along the Cromwell Road\ninto work?\n\u2022TALKING OF VANS, when the\nIC delegation visited the University\nof London Union on Tuesday night,\ntheir van was clamped in the ULU car\npark. The fact was announced during\nthe General Union Council, much to\nthe amusement of all delegates except\nthose from IC. However, UL U Vice\nPresident (Finance and\nAdministration) 'Fat' Norm ordered\nthe clamp to be removed when he\ndiscovered that the IC delegation had\nrung up the RCSU 'Bolt-cutter' Squad\nand asked them to take the thing off\nthemselves.\n\u2022 THERE SEEMS TO BE a private\nbattle being fought in the FELIX\nletters pages recently which nobody\nelse understands. I decided to\ninvestigate and discovered that\nresidents of Tizard Hall are making\ngood use of their proximity to\nLinstead in Princes Gardens. Because\nTizard is at right-angles to Linstead\ncertain rooms can be observed, using\nbinoculars, by peeping-Tizard-toms.\nThese Tizard chap pies think it's tremendous fun to ring these women\nup and describe in great detail\neverything they have done with their\nboyfriends in the last hour. They have\nalso managed to plant 'bugs' in some\nrooms, in order to monitor the sound\nas well as the vision. They\ncat agori call y deny that they are in any\nway related to 'perverts'.\n'Number 1: To be the boss. Number\n2: To do everything. Number 3: To no\nconfidence any citizen not doing their\njob, and take over what they were\nsupposed to do. Number 4: To crawl\nup the Baron's arse hole on every\nissue.'\nIan Whygate had just finished\nwriting his job description. It would\nmake him the most powerful citizens'\nLeader in the history of Cheapskate.\nNow he started on the Deputy Leader:\n'1. To be responsible to Ian Whygate. 2. To do what Ian Whygate\ntells you. 3. To take all the blame when things go wrong. 4. To spank\nIan Whygate's bottom whenever requested.'\nThis was jolly good fun. Whygate hadn't had as much fun since\nhe, since he, err...since he was chased around the citizens' office by\nGillian Cutlet, a very tasty member of the citizens' dormitory\ncommittee.\nWhygate was having so much fun that he thought he'd be really\nnaughty and totally change the Honorary Slave's description:\n'1. To organise Ian Whygate's parties. 2. To publicise Ian Whygate's parties. 3. To return Ian Whygate's friends in every election. 4. To\nspank Ian Whygate whenever the Deputy Leader was unavailable.'\nHmmm, though Whygate, Number 3 might be a bit difficult. There\nwas this little matter of the Cheapskate general election in which all\nthe citizens were allowed to vote. Whygate would go and see his\nchum, John Secretary, about it. He picked up the phone and was about\nto call John when he realised that a funny handshake wouldn't work\non the phone.\n'Bother, I 'll have to go and have lunch with him.'\nOver a McNorthey burger and chips, Whygate casually dropped the\nsubject of elections.\n'Tell me John, when you were governor of the Gilbert and Sullivan\nIslands, how did you make sure that none of the troublesome locals\nwon the elections?'\n'Oh, that's quite easy', said John, 'come back to my office and\nI 'll show you something very interesting'.\nJohn took Ian back to his office, unlocked the bottom drawer of\nhis desk and produced a little green book. He handed it to Whygate.\n'How to win elections and influence people', read Whygate, 'by\nF Marcos'. Ian turned to John and grovelled most profusely. He then\nstarted to flick through the book.\n'Wow, it's a signed copy', gasped Whygate as he turned the front\npage, 'it must be worth a lot'.\n'About twenty years in office if you play your cards right', replied\nJohn, 'you can borrow it if you want, but guard it carefully'.\nIan set off for the citizens' office armed with this little jewel of a book. Now all the Cheapskate general elections could be used to put\nin Whygate's friends. Whygate didn't want to spoil the fun of the\ncandidates though so he didn't tell anyone, not even his candidates.\nElsewhere in the citizens' building, candidates were starting to get\ntheir publicity machines rolling.\nChas piano-player had bribed Martyn Prick to propose a silly motion\nat the citizens' meeting just so that he, Nige D Butcher and Willhebe\nGoodforacolumninch could get a mention. Cwis Media had gone one\nbetter by printing a little piece of paper with his name on it and by\ngiving a little report.\nMeanwhile, in the Phallix office, Judith Largeamounts was preparing\nto virtually run the office single-handed for a few weeks. This was\nsupposed to be so that all candidates could prepare their posters\nconfidentially, but it was really Largeamounts way of making sure\nthat her candidates won.\nWho will win the General Elections\u2014Whygate's or Largeamounts'\ncandidates?\nHow many of you will vote for me?\nFind out in the next episode of the Baron of Cheapskate.\n\u2022 FEW PEOPLE could have\nimagined a worse punishment than\nhaving to endure being talked to by\nC& GU President David Tyler but this\nis what will happen to a kidnapped\nUniversity College London Union\nsabbatical this week if his Union\ndoesn't pay a sum to ICU Rag!\n\u2022NAUGHTY NIGE WHITFIELD,\nthe infamous IC Radio News Editor\nhas been up to his bad old ways again.\nAt a recent meal out with a few other\nICR hacks, Nigel was seen scribbling\na secret message to the voluptuous\nwaitress on the bill.

    "content": "FOOTBALL\nShaken by the ball\nSAILING\nLight winds\nIC vs Surrey University\nThis weekend saw IC in action against\nSurrey University. Conditions were\nexcellent, light winds and plenty of\nsunshine to roast those with dry suits\non.\nNot to be put off by the late arrival\nof the opposition (still celebrating\nFriday) we had time for some\nsightseeing, somewhere near\nGuildford. Over early morning coffee\nthe capt ian Richard Jarman talked\ntactics and instilled his enthusiasm in\nthe team.\nThe three morning races went well\nfor IC, as Surrey were taken out in\nthe first race by a surprise attack from\nthe rear, good covering by Ape\nenabled the last boat to gain 1st place.\nThis gave an easy win with 1st,2 nd and 5th places to IC.\nSurrey were clearly stunned and\nlooked like losing the 2nd race, but\nalthough 1st place was assured for IC,\n3rd and 5th slipped to 4th and 6th under pressure from Surrey. Giving\nthem a close win.\nBoth teams pushed hard in the 3rd race with many forced mistakes or\nrule offences resulting in points\n(known as greens) agains the\noffending boats. By the end of the\nrace IC were not in the top places but\nscraped through on points after a contested protest, giving us a23 win\noverall.\nFollowing an ample lunch,\ndesigned to give Surrey a weight\nadvantage in the light afternoon airs,\nsailing was continued with a change\nin boats and teams. This compounded\nthe problem of weight advantage,\nwith both the captain and commodore\nin the same boat. However, Sam Page\n(commodore) was determined to do\nwell, resulting in a very close race and\nsuperior roll tacks from IC. Light airs\nwere getting lighter and eventually\nSurrey decided to withdraw. The\nafternoon result being a draw, IC\nmanaged to scrape an overall win.\nIC V1 LSE V0 Last Saturday, somewhat shaken by\nthe Ball (at the Savoy the night\nbefore), IC V assembled for their Cup\nsemi-final against LSE V. The match was annoyingly close.\nLSE were hardly in the Liverpool\nmould, despite dominating, IC had\nvery few clear cut chances. The one\nopening fell to Tan, who, with a quick\nshuffle of that famous waistline\ncleared a path to goal, but his superb\nshot was only stopped by a save so\nabsolutely sensational that it would\nhave made even the great Steve Von\nBargen proud (can I have that fiver\nnow please Tan?). In defence, IC\nwere so dominant that our goalie,\nSteve, went off for thirty minutes for\na jodrell and no one noticed. Jon,\nMike, Lee and Basher made it easy\nfor the team. On the sidelines, Kev,\nBrad and Al were contributing their\nsupport with great passion. The game\nIC II 2-Goldsmiths II 1\nHaving been unable to play for two\nweeks due to flooded pitches, IC\nfound themselves up against\nGoldsmiths again, in another top of\nthe table clash. With much pre-match\nbanter and a fine speech from captain\nJezz Holland, IC II set out to show\nwhy they are the most successful IC\nteam this season. The mixture of\nexperience of Paul Thompson, Russ\nDark and the \"balding Andy Allen,\nwith the youthful running and\nenthusiasm of Guy Phiri and Chris\nBurton proved too much for\nGoldsmiths. Mickey Plummer and Ed\nCoates combining brilliantly on the\nleft forced many chances. Ed himself\nopened the scoring mid-way through\nthe first half, with a cool, clinical\nfinish, from just inside the box.\nGoldsmiths rallied, and should have\ndrifted to extra time. Tan's ageing\nlegs were replaced by the 'not much\nmore energetic' Paul. John Bolger\ncame into his own, and inevitably, the\ngoal came.. .Peter played a superb ball\nthat sliced the defence like a knife\nthrough a carrot (ok, no more jokes\nabout the redecorated bathrooms).\nBassim took it in his stride, cut inside,\nfended off the defender and struck the\nmost unbelievable lob over the\nadvancing goalkeeper. The ball took\nan eternity to cross the line (in fact,\nalmost as long as it took for the Dean\nto finish his dinner speech), but it\ncrept in, and we were there. They\nwere never going to score. Ean and\nGlenn were simply strolling it in\nmidfield, and despite Basher's booking late in the game (first of the\nseason for anyone in the team), IC\nhad done it.\nequalise d straight away, but their\nhopeful shot blazed over the bar. Just\nbefore half-time, Jezz Holland went,\ndown after a coll is on with a Goldsmiths forward. An expected\ntorn calf muscle could rule Jezz out\nof the rest of what has been an\nunlucky season for him. After the\nswitch, as Jeff Fitzgerald came on as\nsub, Chris Burton dropped into\ndefence but Goldsmiths fought back.\nRakesh Muthoo's growing influence\non the game inspired IC and after a mix up in Goldsmiths' defence,\nRakesh stabbed the ball home. IC then\ncontrolled the game until the final\nwhistle. Having beaten most teams at\nleast once now in the league, IC look\nto be odds-on favourites for the\nleague.\nBADMINTON\nStruggle\nUAU Challenge Round\nIt has been a good year so far for IC\nbadminton in UAU with all teams\nreaching the last 16 but then the only\nrewards for this achievement were 3\nvery tough away draws. The Mens\nand Ladies teams both drew last\nyear's championships, Loughborough\nand Birmingham respectively and\nMens II had to travel to Bath.\nBirmingham defeated IC in the\nLadies final last year so a victory in\nthis mid-stage competition would\nhave been sweet revenge. Sadly this\nwas not to be, even though\nBirmingham had split up their first\npair to even out the strength of their\nteam. The match was close but might\nhave been closer. Julie Goodeve and\nUta Boltze, having beaten the first\npair, had also beaten the Birmingham\nseconds. The IC seconds, Sarah\nThreadgold and Ann Redley, also had\na good match by beating the\nopponents third pair and then\nnarrowly losing out to the\nBirmingham firsts\u2014another crucial\nand match winning result. The end\nresult was 6-3 in Birmingham's favour, a repeat of last year's final.\nIn Bath the Mens second team were\nmade to struggle. Although Alastair\n.McMaster and Svein Tollefsen nearly\ncaused a riot by winning 2 of their 3\nrubbers it was not enough to see them\nto the quarter finals. The final score\nwas a victory to Bath by 7-2.\nHaving seen Loughborough's team\nat the U AU championships last\nNovember there was a great deal of\nhope and a genuine feeling that IC\nmight create an upset by defeating the\nchampions. This hope turned to\nwishful thinking as Loughborough\ncruised to a90 whitewash despite\nsome defiant badminton from the IC\nteam. In reality some of the matches\nwere not as one-sided as the score line suggests but it was a shame that after\nso much effort we did not even come\naway with a point.\nBalding, but favourites\nHOCKEY\nNice strategy\u2014shame about the result\nIC 0\u2014Bristol 2\nImperial College l sts travelled West\nlast Wednesday to play against Bristol\nUniversity in the U AU challenge\nround. Up against a highly coached,\nskilled, fancied and supported team,\ncaptain Brooking recognised IC to be\nthe underdogs. Counting on this\nyear's exceptional defence, he\nsanctioned a disciplined marking\ngame coupled with surprise counter-attacks. This strategy kept IC in\ncontention during the first half with\nno player making more vital\ninterceptions and tackles than\nBrooking himself. Brendan Farmer\nfollowed his captain's example. The\nearly second half continued in the\nsame fasion\u2014outstanding defence\nwith sporadic attack. With only\ntwenty minutes to play, the Bristol\nteam were losing discipline and IC\nwere beginning to create goal\nchances. Skipworth, Vamadevan and\nCollman all failed to turn openings\ninto a famous victory. Ironically it\nwas now Bristol who were able to\ncounter-attack. They did so\neffectively forcing short corners and,\neventually, a goal. With IC forced\ninto the attack, a second goal\ninevitably came. The loss of Brooking\n(sent off) sealed the game for Bristol,\ngiving them a place in the quarter\nfinals.\nFELIX Friday February 12th198815\\ "

    "content": "Papa: a man for all\nseasons?\nWell a few interesting things have\nhappened since I last wrote a piece for\nFELIX, so I thought I ought to tell\nyou.\n1. There is a 'Stop Clause 28'\nmarch and rally in Manchester on\nSaturday February 20th, which is\nfollowed by a festival in the evening,\nwith the Communards, Erasure and\nother cel ebs turning up to perform!\n(free entrance to any of Manchester's gay nightclubs as a bonus!! Anyone\nwho wants to go, it's only \u00a35 on BR\nif you've got a rail card, or I can (for\nabout \u00a33) get you a seat on a coach\nif you contact me asap (Union Office\nor Mech Eng pigeonholes).\n2. The Society for Lesbian and Gay\nStudents (SLAGS) is now official, we\nmeet in the Green Committee Room\non Wednesday at 12.30pm( top floor\nof the Union Building) come and chat,\nelections soon, noticeboard on\nSherfield walkway and some exciting\n(?) speakers too! I'm very pleased that\nso many new people have been\ncoming along. If you people make the\neffort I'm sure you will benefit (I mean, you'll get to meet me for a start).\n3. I am very, very worried by the\namount of obscene graffiti I see in the\nMech Eng and Union Building toilets.\nEither some of you have perverse\nimaginations, or there are some pretty\ndesperate people out there. I'm worried that it may be the latter, and\nmy advice to these people is that they\nshould try and get out and meet other\ngay people in more normal\nsurroundings, eg pubs, nightclubs or\ngroups like SLAGS or ULU Lesbian\nand Gay Group. Not only is meeting\npeople through graffiti in toilets\nprobably dangerous but it gives a very\nbad impression of gay people. I, for\none, have made many new and fun\nfriends from these meetings and I'm sorry to disappoint everyone (oh God,\nI'm going to ruin my image) but I haven't slept with any of them! Bang\ngoes my New Year resolutions.\n4. I have been flirting all week as\nI want to get a record number of\nValentines this year. I need to get nine\nbecause I got eight in 1986, so please\nsend me a Valentine, even those (few)\nwho don't fancy me!\nJames Papa, I lesbian & Gay Welfare Officer.\nNo tax on reading\nThere are strong rumours that in next\nmonth's Budget, the Chancellor of the\nExchequer may extend the coverage\nof VAT in line with European\nCommunity guidelines. One area that\nmay be thus taxed is publishing-books,newspapers and magazines.\nTo tax the published word is to tax\ninformation and knowledge, the\nbricks and mortar of a university\ndegree. A tax on reading has been\nopposed for over 100 years by\nsuccessive governments. As well as\nhitting the student directly, it would\nmake a big dent in education budgets\nand research being done for\npublication.\nIn the College Bookshop, all prices\nwould rise overnight by up to 15%,\nand it is unlikely the Chancellor will\nincrease student grants to cope with\nthis increase in expenditure.\nIf you oppose VAT on reading,\nwrite to your MP and MEP now,\ntelling him that you strongly object to\nthe concept of tax on information and\nknowledge and asking them to take up\nthe fight against VAT on the written\nword.\nAlistair Bircht\nInternal Services Officer\nLetter from St Mary's One of the best things to happen in\na term, from my point of view, is a visit to the mountain hut in North\nWales. Being a northerner life in\nLondon can get claustrophobic,\nrepetitious and draining. Escaping\nfrom the mad house, allowing the\nbody to naturally recharge is as good\na tonic as beer north of Watford\n(plenty of that too).\nThe hut at Drws-y coed (four miles\nwest of Snowdon) is the perfect\nescape. Given to the medical school\nsome years ago, the hut has been\nconverted from a holiday cottage into\na bunk house. The situation is\nexcellent, with walks and good\nclimbing nearby.\nAll meets produce a little legend in\nthemselves, which is all recorded in\nthe log book. Obviously certain times\nof the year see 'events', notably the\nFreshers' Meet, where horrible things\nare done to and by newcomers. In my\nfirst year, I shall always remember\nseeing a certain gentleman fill half a bucket because he was too drunk to\nclimb downstairs and spend a penny.\nBy the Dinner Meet at Christmas,\nthose first years have found their own\nniche and a few join the older\nmembers in a weekend of what can\nonly be described as true debauchery.\nBarrels were taken up in the bus, the\nonly problem being that the glasses\nwere in one of the cars. A transfer of\npint pots was executed at 70 mph on\nthe M5.\nArriving at 3am, those who had\ntravelled up earlier were suffering\nfrom alcohol withdrawal symptoms,\nas all the ale travelled in the bus.\nThirsts were soon quenched and many\nmoved off to bed, the only problem\nbeing that a vocal minority insisted on\nsinging well into the morning. Only\ntheir seniority saved them from\nserious abuse.\nDuring the day exercise is always\nlight, in preparation for the dinner at\na local hotel. In my case a saunter up\nTryfan off the A5 sufficed, though it\nwas not without difficulty as the\nclamber was on ice all the way to the\nsummit. Not a cloud in the sky added\nto the achievement producing such a feeling impossible in NW6! The view\nwas breathtaking, enhanced by the\nshadows created from a low sun.\nAfter changing into destruct able s, the participants were bussed to the\nhotel on the shores of Llyn Cwellyn.\nSerious eating, drinking and removal\nof garments ensued. Excellent\nspeeches from the distinguished\nmedical people present gained\nrapturous applause.\nThe meeting was a jour ned allowing\nfor those willing to take a dip in the\nlake, before retiring to the bar for a few dozen or so after dinner spirits.\nEven more alcohol awaited our return\nto the hut. The following afternoon\nvarious early options, eg inhabiting\nPete's Eats in Llanbevis proved\npopular and the assembled throng\nmoved off home at dusk, after waiting\nfor a couple of people leaving the\ndecent Flying Buttress a little late.\nHome was finally reached at 2am on\nMonday morning. I Wicked!\nDuvet Monster.\nI love it when\nyou roar at\nme.\nSpud\nSquidlydiddly. Take us\nwith you wherever you\ngo. Love\nAnna & Vicky\nMelanie at St Mary's.I want to stroke you.\nLove Nick Bow\nDarling Steve Pearson,\nleave your new toy girl\nand come back to being\nmy toy boy,\nlots of love\nSue\nMy first is in old but not in the court,\nMy second's in desire that's not to be\nfought,\nMy third is in cold that's not in my heart,\nMy last is in bike but not to depart,\nIf that's me in short,\nthere's one thing to do,\nDeliver this\nriddle to\nVRMI BASU.\n4 Friday February 12th1988 FELIX\n\n"

A survey of\npostgraduates presently in residence\nshowed a favourable response to the\nproposal. It was also felt by SRC that\nhaving entire halls free over the\nholidays would improve the efficiency\nof the Summer Accommodation\nCentre and Letting Scheme.\nHowever, a motion passed by an IC\nUnion General Meeting last term\nstrongly opposed the conversion of\nany part of Southside into a postgraduate hall, as was originally\nproposed.\nThe use of Weeks Hall as a postgraduate residence would have to\nbe subject to the agreement of\nVickers, the engineering company,\nwhich provided money for its\nconstruction. A condition of the\npayment was that Vickers' sponsored\nstudents would be guaranteed places\nin the Hall. If the company agrees to\nthe SRC's suggestions, the proposal\nwill be put to the College Governing\nBody.\nDr Brian Levitt, who chairs SRC,\ncommented that if things go\nsmoothly, Weeks could become a postgraduate hall for the 1988-89\nsession.\nSRC have also set down new rules\non re-applicants. Dr Levitt said that\nre-apps' responsibilities would be\nstated clearly before they take up their\nplaces in future. There had previously\nbeen an 'understanding' that re-apps\nwere expected to help their hall, but\nsome wardens had felt people were\nnot doing enough to justify their\nsecond year in College\naccommodation.\nThe Hall and House Committees\nwill no longer be able to decide who\nis awarded re-app places in their\nresidence. The choice will be carried\nout by the wardens alone. In previous\nyears the committees have voted on\nall the applicants and composed a list\nof preferred candidates. Wardens\nhave been able to veto any people they\nconsider totally unsuitable but not to\nadd names to the list. Dr Levitt said\nthat the change was 'not major'and\nthe decision would now be passed\nformally to the wardens but he did not\nthink that they would appoint re-apps\nwithout first consulting the\ncommittees. 'It would be very\nfoolish', he said.\nHowever, fears have been voiced\nthat the wardens will chose people\nwho will do as the wardens ask but\nwho will be 'unable to stimulate the\nsocial life of the new residents'. Reapps have traditionally been the most\nlively and sociable people, who could\nbe branded as troublemakers by\ncertain wardens. Dr Levitt defended\nthe decision, saying that it was\nessential that re-apps were there to\nhelp their wardens, not hinder them.\nComics\nrelieved\nThe FELIX collection last Friday for\nComic Relief in all departments raised\n\u00a3192.11. The highest amount raised\nin any one department was \u00a352.80\nfrom Mechanical Engineering\nfollowed by \u00a339.01 from Mines, and\n\u00a321.23 from Chemistry.

    "content": "mm\nRevi\nThis film is based on the true story\nof Kenya's greatest scandal. In 1941\nLord Errol, a young Scottish lord,\nwas found murdered outside Nairobi.\nHe was a well known figure in\nKenyan society, one of the happy\nvalley set, and had a reputation as a gambler and adulterer.\nAt the time of his death he was in\nthe middle of an affair with Lady\nDiana Broughton (Greta Scacchi).\nHer husband Lord Broughton was\nsubsequently charged with murder.\nDuring the trial many of the more\nsordid details of Kenyan high society\nlife were revealed. These included\ndetails of adultery, wife swapping and\norgies, the leading perpetrators being\nthe happy valley set.\nIt is this side of the story that\nMichael Radford the director\nconcentrates on. The mystery of the\nidentity of the murderer, unknown to\nthis day, is ignored and the audience\nare left in no doubt as to who Radford\nthinks killed Joss Errol. The film\nconcentrates on the affair between\nJoss and Diana, and not Jack\nBroughton's murder. It is billed as a true story but is very economical with\nthe facts and they are wildly\ninterpreted. The main actors are all\nvery good, especially Joss Alkland as\nBroughton and Trevor Howard in his\nlast role. However, the characters\nthey play have been exaggerated\nalmost into caricatures.\nThe film itself does not do the story\njustice and moves along at a slow pace\nwith a weak script. The cast is superb\nand the acting excellent but they don't make up for the rest of the film.\nMatt Flynn\nAngel Dust\nAs all avid viewers of late-night\nChannel 4 continental films will tell\nyou, it's difficult to tell what the hell\nFrench films are about. In a French\nfilm, a character gazing into space for\nten minutes accomplishes two things;\none, it's a statement about the\ngrowing unease of the working\nclasses at the corruption of the\ncommunist government (or something\nlike that, anyway). Two, it bores half\nthe audience to death in one fell\nswoop. Unfortunately, you have to be\nFrench to appreciate the former, and,\nif you paid to see the film, you're\npretty pissed off at the latter.\nAngel Dust suffers from the same\nproblems that afflict the films of JeanJacques Beineix (who recently\ndirected Betty Blue, easily the most\ncoherent and best French film to be\nreleased in years); the story is\nbasically one of detection, be it\nsomewhat surreal/off the wall.\nHowever, the film attempts to\nintroduce irrational events into a plot\nthat is moving in exactly the opposite\ndirection, and the result is something\nakin to condensing six lanes of the M5\ninto a narrow country lane. The\ndetection plot, which unveils\nmysteries, clashes painfully with the\nintroduction of new, odd mysteries;\nconsequently the film fails either as\na neo-supernatural work or as a straight detective story.\nDespite all this, however, the film\nis still interesting: it's the story of the\navenging of a girl\"^ prostitute\nmother's murder. The girl, Violetta,\nand Gabriel, her life long friend,\nengineer the murder of the pimp\nresponsible for Violetta's mother's death. Policeman Simon Blount starts\ninvestigating, slowly uncovering the\ntruth.\nVioletta and Gabriel are endowed\nwith an almost angel quality, but the\nbasis for this re lig ios e aura is then\nmade absurd by their all too human\ndesire to avenge the mother's murder.\nDespite these labour ed Christian\novertones, the film contains some\nattractive ideas; Simon, the\npoliceman, is rather prone to bouts of\nviolence, and is paralleled with\nGabriel, the murderous 'holy fool',\nand both are portrayed as exceedingly\nvulnerable to Violetta, the controlling\nangel.\nWhile the plot on its own is well\nput together, it's just a bit too\nfluctuating in tone and mood to be\nreally successful. This isn't helped by\nthe gratuitous over-direction; blurring\npans and huge tracking shots distort\nthe narrative, distracting one from the\nplot.\nAngel Dust believes in a simple\ncode of morals; violence is a cleansing force. But strangely\nenough, Angel Dust (probably more\nthan a little related to Angel Heart in\nideas at least) has a charm similar to\nBetty Blue\u2014although it is confusing\nand labour ed, it's nevertheless quite\ngood. However, unless you're really\nsure you want to go and see it, don't, because you might well be very\ndisappointed and peeved at having\nparted with good cold cash.\nAssault on Precinct 13\nA re-release of one of John\nCarpenter's first films; a police\nstation is besieged by a youth mob\narmed with stolen silenced automatic\nweapons. Despite the obvious\nlimitations in budget, the film is still\ngripping\u2014the long, drawn out\nestablishing scenes neatly\ncounterpoint the latter vicious bouts\nof gun play. The characters are\nactually characters, which is a pleasant surprise in this day and age.\nDefinitely worth hiring, even if you\nalready have seen it on telly.\nEric Clapton\nNever having seen Clapton live on\nstage before, I didn't know what to\nexpect, but a few reports told of a brilliant performance. I arrived just\nas the support act, Jonathan Butler,\ncame on stage. He did.as well as\nanybody playing guitar in support to\nClapton could do, but no one was\nreally listening, but rather peering\nthrough a crack in the stage door\ntrying to catch a glimpse of 'God', as\nwe call him. JB left the stage and\neveryone sat around looking\ndisgruntled when suddenly the lights\ndied down and blinding spotlights\nswept the arena. We didn't need to\nbe told who was coming, the\nStratocaster said it all. No one else\ncould play the guitar like that.\nCrossroads began, and from then on\nit was all I could do to take it in. Most\nhad seen him once, many twice, and\nthey could sit and listen, but I was in\nawe of the great power in front of me.\nHe transformed the hard-ripping solo\nof White Room into the relaxing\nWonderful Tonight that you felt that\nyou were on some kind of wonderful\ndrug, but nothing so potent existed.\nIt was only after two hours of his\nplaying that I began to look at his\nband, but band is not the name, since\neach is an artist in his own right. Steve\nxxx(?\u2014TS) and Phil Collins provided\nall the drum support needed, while a madman, Ray Cooper, smashed his\nway through percussion. Alan Clark\nand Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits\nwere on keyboard and guitar, and the\nmarvellous Nathan East was playing\nthe bass guitar. Between them they\nproduced a dream concert. Obviously\nthe rest of the crowd agreed with me,\nbecause he came back three times\u2014I can't read this can someone translate\nit? Preferably the person who wrote\nit\u2014Rose.\nMartyn ?\nSlamdance\nLast year's revival of film noir\u2014see\nthe review in FELIX, last year.\nPlatoon\nOliver Stone's film, ostensibly the\nfilm about Vietnam. However the\nshowing by the BBC of The Killing\nFields this Christmas put Platoon\nwhere it belongs\u2014on the Rambo pile.\nGood viewing, nevertheless.\nCharles Robin\n14 Friday February 12th1988 FELIX\n\n"

The\ncomment that he picked upon, however, just flew out of\nmy mouth on the spur of the moment, and was not meant\nto offend or be misconstrued. But he seems to want to\ntake it further, so just a few points.\n1. While being very grateful for his guest appearance\nat the Holland Club, I feel that as we paid him \u00a310 for\nhis pains, and that he made adequate use of the free\nfacilities available (ie he got drunk as a lord), he really\ncame out of it quite well (unlike the rest of us who as usual\nended up out of pocket).\n2. We were also very grateful for the loan of his personal\ndrum kit( which was his) for our auditions, but as we\nprovided free transport home for himself and his drum kit, this saving him untold train fares, once again he came out\non top.\n3. After extensive consultation with the rest of the band,\nwe feel that the name 'Baby Delta', which agreeably was\ncrap, still left after he did. However this cannot be proved!\n4.1 feel that if Mr McMayhem left the band as stated,\nHe could have made us aware of the fact before Father\nJason was on the phone to him, expressing the band's joint\nwishes that his days were over. I feel that the fact that\nMr Mayhem thought he had left of his own accord pays\ntribute to Jason's tact and compassion in giving him the\nboot.\nHowever, I must thank Andy profusely for giving me\na great deal of amusement, and can only suggest that he\nuses his hard worked for English A Level to greater effect\nin the future.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter A J Hartley,\nex-Union Bar,\nex-Union Snack Bar,\nex-RCS AAO,\nex-cell ent bass player.\nTracy-Ann vs\nMr Tyler\nDear Judith,\nThere was a certain article in the last issue of Guildsheet\nthat rang untrue. Unlike some people, namely Mr Tyler\nand Mr Baker, I make sure I know the facts before I knock\nsomeone's efforts. Whilst I'm on the subject, I might add\nthat I feel Mr Tyler is the last person worthy of telling\nme about my job. Before he does this he should make sure\nthat his own job is done well.\nTo set the record straight, myself and Tanya last term\nattended five out of six Rag meetings each. I supported\nthe biggest Rag event of the year (tid d ly winking) by being\nin the office at 8.30am to give out cans etc not to mention\nselling T shirts. I was helped by friends who had nothing\nto do with Rag and was not joined by Mr Tyler until after\n9am.I went tid d ly winking and helped count money. Next\nthe slave a uc ton \u2014I collected the bulk of the money and\ncounted it, helped by Alan Hepper who has nothing to\ndo with Rag. I was bought by the Rugby Club and gave\n. them a good day of work.\nI hardly think Mr Tyler or Mr Baker have proper\ngrounds to say I have not done my job. My job as I see\nit, is to look after Guilds Rag money and to support some,\nor all, Rag events which I feel I have tried to do. Yet it\nis extremely hard to do a job when Mr Tyler insists on\ninterfering. He happens to be good friends with the IC\nRag Chairman Mr Baker and they have tended to work\nwith each other instead of going through me. Maybe Mr\nTyler should have been Rag Treasurer instead!\nI confess I rarely go to the Guilds Office but I find the\nbad atmosphere and the aggressiveness of Mr Tyler very\noff putting, as I'm sure many of you will agree. I think\nMr Tyler is not so much concerned that I have not done\nmy job but that I have not been to every single event. I get the impression that Tyler thinks anyone who has a post\nin Guilds is supposed to attend every event. Like many\nI have been to those I could afford and found time for.\nI conclude that I believe I have done my job (my\nconception, not Tyler's).I fear, though, that a second vote\nof no confidence I may well get because of those hacks\n(most of those voting) do and think whatever Tyler says\nis right.\nTracy-Ann Hall,\nC&G Rag Treasurer.\nPS. Having done the job I feel that there is really no\nneed for a Rag Treasurer in Guilds: RCS seem to manage\nwithout one.\nPPS. For the record, Mr Tyler and I have not seen eye\nto eye ever since I ran for President against him.\nMore incoherent\nmuttering\nI was shocked to read Julian Moore's \u2014oops!\u2014Dracula\nJ's letter in last week's FELIX.\nFirstly I would like to thank Mr Neil Humphrey for\nsubmitting his letter on our behalf. I find it not in the least\nsurprising that Mr Moore should have to resort to personal\nabuse in order to explain the shortcomings of his\nUVR+DDL column (Broadsheet).\nI would like to point out that the reason everyone found\nMr Humphrey's letter 'completely incomprehensible' was\nthat no-one ever reads UVR+DDL anyway. The fact that\neven J M himself failed to comprehend the letter does tend\nto support the allegation that UVR+DDL is actually\nchurned out by chimps and not Jooly Wooly at all.\nPerhaps Jooly Wooly would also like to extend the label\n'illiterate' to all of his readers, since if the 'illiterate' Mr\nHumphrey had not brought his 'Chimpsheet' article to our\nattention it would have been given its usual role as a piece\nof Andrex.\nAs for calling NH' gru mph and pervert'! Jooly Wooly's imagination seems to stretch little further than 'three in\nbed orgy', 'Radio Bonk', 'teddy bear' and 'pervert'\u2014all\nphrases purely of his own invention.\nJooly Wooly is grossly misunderstood. If his favourite\nwords truly are 'bon k', 'teddy' and 'orgy', he should be\nhailed as nothing less than a genius, since most of his\ncontemporaries are still running around shouting 'would\nyou like to see some puppies?'.\nIt is always nice to see the syllabus at Eton moving with\nthe times.\nWalls have ears, so watch it Jooly.\nYours faithfully,\nK McC, Tizard Surveillance Society, VP.\nFELIX Friday February 12th19881 "

    "content": "News\nNo more Vice\nLachie Stuart, sabbatical Vice\nPresident (Services) at the University\nof London Union (ULU) was forced\nto resign last Tuesday after a No\nConfidence Motion was passed at\nULU's governing body, General\nUnion Council (GUC).\nThe motion was proposed by the\nSports and Societies Councils at\nULU, and alleged that Mr Stuart was\ncontinually out of the building on\n'business which is not directly\nconcerned with ULU affairs, had not\nproduced any campaigning publicity\nof consequence since taking office and\nthat he had not been car ying out other\nduties he is responsible for'. They\nalso claim that since he is standing in\nthe forthcoming National Union of\nStudents (NUS) elections, he will\nhave even less time for ULU in the\nfuture.\nIn his defence, Lachie admitted that\nhe had done nothing for Sports and\nSocieties, but felt that he could only\ninterfere anyway, and they were\nbetter running themselves. He also\nclaimed that although he had not spent\nmuch time at ULU, he was spending\nhis time travelling around the\nconstituent colleges, and this was a more important part of the job.\nThe motion might not have been\nheard at all, as it was proposed that\nthe motion was unconstitutional. It\nwas put forward as an 'emergency\nmotion' that, under ULU rules, has\nto be submitted at least 24 hours in\nadvance. However, Mr Stuart did not\nhear of the motion until the meeting\nitself, despite there being an\nExecutive meeting the night before at\nwhich both the proposer s of the\nmotion and Mr Stuart were present.\nThe meeting did vote to accept the\nmotion, and then went on to pass the\nNo Confidence Motion by the 2\n/3rds majority that requires Mr Stuart to\nresign.\nAt the same meeting, GUC voted\nfor motions supporting the nurses\nstrike, the campaign against clause 28\nin the Local Government Bill banning\n'the promotion of homosexuality', the\ncampaign against the Alton Bill\nlimiting abortions to 18 weeks, and\nthe right of students to September\nres its.

In total last\nyear 69,035 women and 83,495 men\napplied.\nThe UCCA figures also show that\nwomen applicants rose by 12% to a total of 22,726, with an increase in\napplicants from women in Eire from\n1,740 (1986) and 4,033 (1987).\nDiary of an\nImperial prof\nUniversity academics around the\ncountry are being asked to keep a detailed diary of how they spend their\nworking time. Planned by the\nUniversity Grants Committee (UGC)\nand Committee for Vice Chancellors\nand Principals, the survey should\nshow how much time academics\nspend on research and teaching. This\ninitiative comes after increased\npressure on the UGC to justify the\nfunds it spends on research. The\nDepartment of Education and Science\nmay take heed of a suggestion by the\nResearch Councils that up to 5 % of\nthe UGC budget should be moved to\ntheir budgets.\nReform Bill\nTory rebels in the House of Commons\nhave argued that the timetable for the\nEducation Reform Bill may allow\ninsufficient time to debate on Higher\nEducation.\nThere are grave fears for the\nproposed Universities Funding\nCouncil which the Royal Society and\nBritish Academy claim threaten\nexcellence and innovation. Paddy\nAshdown MP described the Bill as\none of the most dangerous pieces of\nlegislation for the past fifty years.\nChris Hawkins MP said that\nautonomy in British universities was\nunder threat, and pointed out that one\nin six university staff had lost their\njobs between 1979 and 1987 whilst\nthe Department of Education and\nScience had lost two. Education\nSecretary Mr Baker claimed that\nopposition MPs were attempting to\ntalk out the Bill.\nCatastrophe\nThe College Finance Section has been\nthrown into disarray since a 'catastrophic failure' of the disc subsystem on January 4th and 5th, followed by a second one on January\n10th this year.\nThe last print-outs to be sent out to\ndepartments was for the period up to\nNovember 19th1987. It has also\nproved impossible to process staff\nexpenses or payments to suppliers\nsince the beginning of the year, with\nsuppliers refusing to deliver until bills\nare paid.\nJohn Davidson, College\nAdministrative Secretary claims that\nthey have had to contend with\n'significant hardware failures, caused\nby an earlier power supply problem,\ncombined with operator errors and\nsystems deficiencies have corrupted\nthe database on which the finance\nsystem is based'.\nMeanwhile, the Union is planning\nto raise the matter of last year's audits\nwhich have still to be processed at\ntoday's Finance & Executive meeting.\nThe Union's audit should have been\ncompleted by November last year but\nmost major sub-committees of the\nUnion still have their books to be\nlooked at by the auditors.\nBoycott\nScientists may boycott research\nfunded by the Department of Health\n& Social Security if ministers try to\nuse new powers to block funding s which would be politically\nembarrassing.\nAll DHSS contracts now state that\nscientists must get the Department's permission before publishing any\nresults.

There is no I charge so this year's elections could be great fun with several joke candidates promised\nfor each post. There might even be a few serious ones.

Therefore,\nIan Howgate, proposed by Kenneth Young\nI strongly advise all voters to follow my example\nand place a I by Ian Howgate\u2014you won't regret it.\nI have many plans for the Union, most of which\nwould bore the average student silly, but include;\nUnion reorganisation, pushing for better\naccommodation and sports facilities, continued\nimprovement of College refectories and a drastic\nreorganisation of the entertainments machine.\nThere is far too much of a 'College verses\nstudents' feeling at present and these barriers need\nto be broken down so we can all work together foi\nthe best results. I became involved in the Union\nlast year, because I and friends were experiencing\nlittle representation in halls and in my department.\nThe result was that I took up these jobs myself.\nI now wish to work for all of you to make this\nCollege a better place for everyone.\nFELIX EDITOR Judith Hackney, proposed by Ciaran Hassett\nJudith Hackney is one of the best candidates ever\nto have stood for the post of FELIX Editor.

She has held\nseveral important Union posts, including two years\nas Publications Board Junior Treasurer and Vice\nPresident of RCSU.

Otherwise, I would like to\nthink that we're not too far off the path!'\nWould she stand for the post again if she\ncould? 'If I had a year to re-coupe rate, I would. It's hard work but very rewarding. It's the best sabbatical in that respect. The worst\npart is having to manage the Union's Print\nUnit and cope with all the machinery\nbreakdowns.'\nHON SECRETARY\u2014CHAS JACKSON\nChas feels that he has been true to his;\nmanifesto in parts but became morose when II asked him if he was enjoying being a sabbatical. 'Occasionally, when I forget\nmyself.' Would he stand for the same post\nagain if he could? 'Nof**king way (doctor's orders?), especially if the post was in such a mess as when I started.' Would he rather have\ndone a 'real' job this year, then? 'It would i probably have been much less hassle, but not\nreally. What af** king condescending\nquestion!' Has he found the job rewarding?\n'Certainly not financially! However, I 've'\nlearnt a lot and it is nice to sort out problems' for third parties, which seems to be a large-part of it.'\nHON SECRETARY Chas Jackson, proposed by Hugh Southey\nThe Hon Sec needs to be somebody who is going\nto work hard for the Union. Chas has shown that\nhe is prepared to do this. As Union Publicity\nOfficer, Chas has produced tons of posters, being\none of the people who ensured that the QT boycott\nwas a success. He has served on working parties\nto reorganise the Union and has helped in the office\ndoing the jobs that nobody else has time to do.\nChas, though, has not just become involved this\nyear in order to become a sabbatical. He has been\ninterested in the Union for longer than he and 1 care\nto remember. Vote for Chas Jackson for a hard\nworking Hon Sec.\nHugh Southey\nNext year there are a number of important changes\nwhich must be made to the Union Office and\norganisation. The Hon Sec and all the sabbaticals\nmust be closely involved with this. An Hon Sec\nmust also be a decision maker with proposals for\nthe good of the Union Amongst my concrete\nproposals are;\nDuplicating\nAs the Union Office now has two geste tn ers and\ntwo electrostatic scanners, I will try to set up ages tet ner with a scanner for the use of clubs and\nsocieties.\nExec News\nIt is vitally important that students are kept\ninformed of the actions of Union Officers and\nsabbaticals. If elected I would produce this\nfortnightly and print it in FELIX. 1 hope that it will\ninclude adverts for discounts in local cinemas and\nshops.\nTransport\nExpansion of the fleet would mean that more non-RCC clubs could use the vans at weekends.\nHowever I will examine possible alternatives to\nbuying new vans. Perhaps contract hiring could\nprovide an answer. At the moment, outside hire\nof vans at weekends is very expensive.\nChas Jackson\nFriday February 12th1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "What is a superconductor?\nSuperconductors are the materials\nwhich, when they are cooled below\na certain temperature, display zero\nresistivity. The electrical current pass\nthrough the body of a superconductor\nwithout any loss of energy at all. An\nimportant feature of these materials\nis that they exclude any magnetic field\nthat would normally penetrate them.\nThis is called.the Meissner effect or\nperfect diamagnetism.\nWhy is superconductivity\nimportant?\nUsing superconductors we can use\nelectric current without any losses due\nto resistance. Powerful magnets can\nbe made which are used in medical\nequipment (NMR), particle\naccelerators, magnetic separation,\nmagnetic levitation trains and other\napplications with a lower cost than if\nconventional electromagnets were\nused. Moreover, there are\napplications such as very sensitive\nmagneto meters which could not even\nexist without superconductivity.\nToday, the conventional\nsuperconductors represent a market of\n\u00a3110 million'($200 million) a year\nand, it is estimated, this will increase\nto \u00a3930 million ($1,700 million) a year by the end of the century.\nCeramic Superconductors:\nThe new generation\nUntil 1986, the materials which were\nused were only super conductive below 13 to 23K(260 to -250\u00b0C), so liquid Helium with boiling point\nat 4.2K was the only coolant that\ncould be used.\nIn September 1986, Bednorz and\nMuller published a paper announcing\nthe discovery of an oxide which\nbecame superconducting at 30K under\nthe modest title:'Possible High To\nSuperconductivity in the La-Ba-CuO system'. It made a great impression\non the scientific community and\nresearchers started experimenting\nwith these ceramics. The paper was\na breakthrough and in February 1987,\nProfessor Chu's group at Houston\ndiscovered superconductivity at 94K in the Y Ba-Cu-0 system. Bednorz\nand Muller were awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Physics later in 1987 for their\ndiscovery.\nRaising the critical temperature to\n94K is very important, because liquid\nnitrogen can now be used for cooling\nsince its boiling point is 77K. Liquid\nnitrogen is ten times cheaper than\nliquid helium and much more easy to\nhandle. It costs about the same as\nmilk.\nFollowing this discovery many\nuniversities and companies around the\nworld set up research teams. Up to\nthe end of 1987 there had been no\nsuccess in the search for new\nmaterials with critical temperatures\nhigher than 94K. However, much\nprogress has been reported on the\nknowledge of the structure, the\nproperties and the fabrication of these\nmaterials.\nAccording to recent newspaper\nreports, a new compound consisting\nof Al-Bi-Ca-Cu-Sr-0 has been found\nto be superconducting at 114K, but\nthis has yet to be confirmed by any\nscientific publication.\ncircuits of microchips have recently\nbeen made experimentally in Japan,\nusing integrated circuit technology.\nMany of the above methods are\nbeing tried by research staff of the\nImperial College. A demonstration of\nsuperconductivity took place during\nthe RSM Open Day last term, where\npieces of magnet floated over\nsuperconducting pellets as a result of\nthe Meissner effect.\nGovernments are eager to provide\nthe funds and characteristic of their\nSUPERCONDUCTORS by Y. Kontoulis\nScientists use every possible\ntechnique to study the characteristics\nof YBajCUjO^g( the so-called 1-2-3\ncompound) from methods like\nThermogravimetric Analysis (TVA),\nM Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)\nand Scanning Electron Microscopy\n(SEM) to the most sophisticated like\nNeutron Powder Diffraction and High\nResolution Electron Microscopy\n(HREM).\ninterest are the following facts:\nPresident Reagan proposed a superconductivity initiative consisting\nof eleven points for 'the promotion of\ngreater cooperation among\ngovernment, academia and industry;\nencouragement of the private sector\nmore rapidly to commercial is e scientific advances and improved\nprotection of the intellectual property\nrights of those working in the field'.\nThe research for new compounds\nis extensive and many groups have\nsubstituted the elements of the 1-2-3\ncompound hoping to produce a compound with a high critical\ntemperature. In fact substitution for\nY gave encouraging results, but the\nnew compounds made with Ho, Eu,\nGd, Nd, Er and other rare earth\nelements do not display\nsuperconductivity at temperatures\nexceeding 93-94K. For experimental samples, the\nfabrication of the 1-2-3 compound\nsimply in vo ves the mixing and firing\nof Y203, BaC03 and CuO. In order\nto improve the quality of the material,\nhowever, more complex processes are\nnow being used like freeze-drying,\nsol-gel, co precipitation, spray-drying\nand others.\nAnother interesting view of the\nsubject is the fabrication of thin films\nby methods such as sputtering and\nmet all organic deposition.\nExperimental superconducting\nThe Ministry of International Trade\nand Industry (MITI) of Japan founded\nan 'International Center on\nSuperconductivity', providing money\nfor and having the support of many\nJapanese companies. It has been\nreported that the funds are around\n$50million. Britain has just named Cambridge\nas a 'Superconductivity University\nResearch Centre' and has also\napproved many research programmes\nincluding that of Imperial College.\nThe SERC has committed \u00a32million in the form of grants.\nAt Imperial, the Departments of\nMaterials, Physics, Chemistry are all\ninvolved in the research of\nsuperconductivity. Their research\ngroups meet regularly in order to\ncoordinate the research, to inform one\nanother on the progress that has been\nmade and to discuss the problems that\narise. Their results have been reported\nat a conference in Bristol and at\nanother one in London in December.\nThe Meissner Effect: A magnet is\nlevitated over a superconducting\nsurface. The superconductor, cooled\nwith liquid nitrogen to 77K(196 \u00b0C) expels the magnetic field and makes\nthe magnet levitate.\nFELIX Friday February 12th1988 \u20227\n\n"
