    "content": "UJU2 C0IIIIVG EVENTS\nICWA leads the wan\nA Fresher ICWArian, Miss Thelma West,\nwas one of a party of five members of Imperial College who, with a post-graduate from\nKing's College, completed the 40 mile Lyke\nWake Walk in just under 16 hours.\nThis was the first weekend of the term organised (by the Imperial College Y. H.A. Group, in this case specially for a handful\nof enthusiasts (whom many regarded as slightly eccentric) who wished to try the Lyke Wake\nWalk. This is a cross-country hill walk over\nthe North York Moors from west to east,\ncrossing the fells at their highest and wildest\nwithin a24 hour time limit.\nThe party of twelve set off from College\non the evening of Friday the 13th. Fog delayed the journey north by hired dor mobile but at 4.40 a.m. we arrived at the triangulation point near Osmotherley which marks\nthe start of the walk, and the hiking party\nset out in earnest. Two hours' fumbling a round in the dark produced relatively little\nprogress but, with the coming of daylight, conditions improved and in four hours we met\nthe dor mobile party for a hurried hot soup\nbreakfast. On again, with mist now spoiling\nthe views but progress' easier along a disused\nrailway which here forms a convenient path.\nA quick, fc nac k at Rosedale Head and the\nparty, now reduced from seven to six, pushed\non along the dead straight path marked by\na line of white boundary stones. Soon we were\ncrossing Wheeldale Moor and then dropping\ndown into the valley for more welcome refreshment near Wheeldale Youth Hostel, again kindly provided by our efficient team\nof cooks in the dor mobile. Tired now, and beginning to feel the strain\nof eleven bom*' walking over very rough\nmoorland deep in heather, the party made its\nway past Eller Beck and so on over Fylingdales Moor, the whole country now bathed\nin an autumnal glow from the sun setting in\nthe west at the close of what had been a glorious day.\nHowever, we had not finished yet and although we- succeeded in getting off the moors\nbefore dark, there were still four miles to go.\nWe all chose a slightly longer and easier\nroute, but two Yorkshire-men, as if drawn\nby a magnet to the bar at the end of the walk\nat Ravenscar, suddenly shot ahead and were\nthere to welcome the party when the other\nfour limped in some sixteen hours after setting out.\nWe had done it! Well inside the allowed\ntime of twenty-four hours, but a good deal\nof the credit must go to the support party\nin the dor mobile who drove 150 miles over\nnarrow lanes to give the walkers hot food\nand drink whenever the route crossed a road.\nA restful night in Boggle Hole Youth Hostel,\na brief visit to Robin Hood's Bay and a leisurely drive back to London completed\nwhat was for all of us a memorable and enjoyable weekend.\nThe walking party consisted of: \u2014\nIan Gibson {leader), Thelma West, Ted\nHerbert* Mike SlaW< Alan Banes (King's College), and Roger Henson.\nThe support party was: \u2014\nKen Vrw)'n( driver), John Spiller (ex hl. C. and co-driver), Mollie Howard, Sue Livingstone, Angela Cowgill (Bedford Collegg) not\nforgetting Chas (native guide l).I.L. G. It is with the greatest pleasure that 'Felix'\nintroduces its 'Coming Events' column. We\nhope that this will help students to fill their\ndiaries long in advance of events and so be\nable to draw up a timetable for themselves.\nSuch events as take place on the same day\nand at the same place every week will not\nbe included in this column due to limitations\nof space; but we shall include all other major\nactivities.\nFRIDAY 27TH OCTOBER:\n1.

To our\nsup rise he complimented the Union on the\nstandard of cooking, so some of the other\nforty-one other College refectories must be\npretty terrible.\nWhen the party retired to the bar, Reg.\nbought a round of pints, balanced himself on\na stool and proceeded to hold forth on a variety of topics, including, naturally enough,\ndentistry, for he is a student at the Royal\nDental Hospital. Reg. completed the visit with\na short discussion at a more serious level in\nthe Union Office.\nObviously, Reg. Fisher could not hope to\nachieve much more than to remind us of our\nvery tenuous connection with U.L. U., and to\nput over a good impression generally, but it\nis good to see that someone is interested in\nbreaking the barrier of mutual indifference between this College and the rest of he University.\n\n"

    "content": "\u2014 6 FELIX OPERA AND BALLET IX. GIBSON\nWith the \"hustle and bustle\" of College\nactivities to occupy the fresher and returning student, it is some time before he acclimatizes himself and begins to look outside for\nhis entertainment. London is one of the major\ncentres of the arts in Western Europe and\nit is a great pity if the University student\ndoesn't avail himself of this fine opportunity\nto see something of the London theatre,\nmusic, opera and ballet. The latter two may\nbe new to anyone from the provinces, but it\nis worth making the effort to accustom oneself to the new medium and accept its con-vent ions. Sadler's Wells provide an almost ideal introduction to the world of opera with a series\nof performances of Rigoletto on Nov. 4th.8 th,16 th and 24th. This early Verdi opera,\nsung, like the vast majority of opera at Sadler's Wells, in English, is full of action and lively\nmusic; and the ending with the heroine dying\nslowly, bravely, and in fine voice is in the\ntrue operatic tradition. In a lighter vein, another opera which nearly always seems to\nfare well at Sadler's Wells is Rossini's comedy \"The Barber of Seville\" (Nov. 3rd,23 rd,28 th), while those for whom Stravinsky holds\nno terrors would enjoy the very fine double\nbill \"Oedipus Rex\" and \"The Nightingale\"\n(Nov. 2nd). At Covent Garden, the Christmas period\nincludes a new production of \"The Magic\nFlute\" by Mozart, conducted and produced\nby Otto Klemperer, and a revival of one of\nVerdi's finest operas \"Don Carlos\". Advance\nbooking for these performances, which are not\nsung in translation, is almost essential and\nopens on Nov. 9th. Arnold Haskell, the celebrated authority on\nballet, visiting the College for General Studies\nsome years ago, when asked what he would\ntake a newcomer to ballet to see, suggested\na full length classical ballet. The Royal Ballet\nat Covent Garden regularly provides an opportunity for following Mr. Haskell's advice and\nperformances of \"Sleeping Beauty\" on\nNov. 8th,9 th,17 th and 27th will allow\n\"ballet oman es\" to compare the performances\nof three of London's leading ballerinas in the\nleading role. Margot Fonteyn will be dancing\nthe part of Princess Aurora in the first and\nlast of the four performances listed above.\nLAMLEY'S TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS ART MATERIALS DRAWING INSTRUMENTS STATIONERY PAPERBACKS1.3&5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7.\" THE KITCHEN\" by ARNOLD WE SK EK On Thursday, Oct. 12th, a disorderly crowd\nof some twenty-two members of the I.C. Dram. Soc. descended upon the stalls of the\nRoyal Court theatre; the large number presumably due to the staggering price reduction offered, the details of which appear to\nbe exclusive to the organiser of the trip, one\nDavid Cain, better known perhaps for his\npartiality for a large stringed musical in s tru ment.\n\"The Kitchen\", which was Wesker's first\nplay, would seem to be something of a pro-duc er's nightmare, involving a cast of thirty\nall of whom appear at times to be talking\nat once. The action takes place in the kitchen of a large West End restaurant during\none working day and is concerned mainly\nwith the reaction of a very assorted crew of\ncooks and waitresses fo one another, and\nto the fact that they are all somewhat over-worked. The main character in this strange\nsituation is a German 'exchange' cook, a quick\ntempered .rather light-hearted individual \u2014\nvery well portrayed by Jeremy Brett, whom\nsome may remember for his interesting\n\"Hamlet\" earlier this year. A notable feature of this cast was the constructive use of\naccents, easing the problem of in det if i cation amongst so many, and particularly well done\nby the two Germans, James Bolan as a Geordie, a dab hand at sour onion soup, and\nHarry Landis, a down-to-earth number one\npastry cook.\nf The set, using no drapes, flats, backlot h or masking, gave the appearance of a large\ndraught y basement; this was, in fact, the stage\nitself, bare and uncluttered, but for ovens\nand tables, and some most effective lighting.\nSound was also im magi native \u2014 though the\noccasional rumbling of the Inner Circle just\nunder the stage was little disturbing.\nOver a pint next door, it was generally\nagreed that the evening had been a great success, and further similar outings would be\nwelcomed. Visits are therefore planned to the\nAldwych and \"Luther\" in the near future,\nand, of course, \"Tiger at the Gates\".\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL Bergman's films have achieved great\npraise and popularity and there is no doubt\nthat he is one of the world's outstanding directors. Recently critics have suggested Bergman has gone into .decline\n\u2014 \"The Face\" was received with (little\nenthusiasm and \"The Virgin Spring\"\neven sharply criticised, but in \"The Seven\nSeal\" he demonstrated the originality and\nsureness of touch which has made him a force\nin the cinema. The best film in 1957 at the\nCannes and Edinburgh Film Festivals and his\nbest film to date (along with \"Wild Srawberries\" it symbolises the current problems of\ndoubt and faith. Set in the middle ages the\nmain player is a knight returning from a Crusade. He meets Death and challenges him to a game of chess. Although he must lose he has\ntime to consider his beliefs and meet people,\namongst whom are a family of strolling players.\nHere, Bergman presents his opposites: the\nknight who cannot believe without proof is\nconquered by Death (although the extent of\ndefeat is reduced) whilst the family, full of\nlove and faith escape Death's clutches. Bergman considers love should conquer death and\nthis 'infinite love' is his God. The film is\ncomplex but stimulating: mediaeval yet con-temporary. The acting and photography are\nsuperb.\nTHE FIVE LEVELS OF BEING Many students of science, used to following logical processes of deduction, and wary\nof accepting any hypothesis until it has been\nexperimentally tested, must be feeling rather\ndisturbed by the series of lectures given every\nTuesday by Mr. E.F. Schumacher. The tone\nof these lectures is largely philosophical, and\nthe lecturer feels that in this subject the non-scientific questions are the basic ones. In contrast to Descartes, who felt himself obliged\nto reject everything and accept nothing but\nthe fact that he himself existed, Mr. Schumacher asserts that as a starting-point\nto philosophy one should \"accept everything\nand reject nothing\", regardless of the fact\nthat in so doing one accept many con tri dic tory assumptions.\nAt the time of writing, two lectures have\nbeen given, and their main theme so far is\nthe classification of objects into four main\nlevels of existence: stone, plant, animal and\nman. A stone, or any other inanimate object,\ncannot think, feel, act, evolve, reproduce, or\nhave much effect on its surroundings. It consists of matter alone. A plant, possesses not\nonly matter but life. In addition to these an\nanimal \u2014 a higher at any rate \u2014 possesses\nintelligence. Man manages to crown matter,\nlife, and intelligence with the possession of\nconsciousness, which means awareness of one-self; the ability to think abstractly, to reason.\nIs there a fifth level, an even higher plane\nof being? Throughout the ages men have said\n\"Yes\"; the only significant exceptions have\nbeen the materialists of modern times. Mr. Schumarcher feels that by denying the existence of God, the materialists are living in\n\"a sort of meaningless waste-land.\" The nature of God can be guessed at by extrapolating the characteristics of the four lower\nlevels of being. For example, a Stone has\nvery little influence on its surroundings.\nPlants, animals and men have successively\nmore power in this respect. One may imagine that on the fifth level this attribute tends\nto infinity. God is therefore omnipotent.\nMr. Schumacher feel that it is impossible to make much sense of Evolution without\ncoming to the conclusion that there is some\nsort of guiding force, aiming at ever-in crea s ing biological complexity, intelligence^ and\nconsciousness. It is therefore quite natural\nthat the universe should not be completely\ndescribable by the laws of physics as they\nstand today, but should be in part non-ph ys ical or supernatural.\nMy own feeling is that the study of this\naspect of nature, and the investigation of\nthe precise relationship between the physical\nand the non-physical, is a subject for\nscientific research rather than philosophy, i hope that in Mr. Schumacher's later lectures\nwe shall hear something of the startling\nmodern discoveries in this field.\n1.C CHOIR The I.C. Choir meets on Tuesday at 5.30\np. rn in Room 342 E.l. Block. It is rehearsing\nworks by Bach and John Blow, and will be\nperforming Beethoven's Mass in C at Easter.\nThere is'still room 'or singers in all voices;\nthere is no audition and everyone is welcome\nto come and sing for an hour and a half on\nTuesday evenings.\n\n"

This is one of the best social\nevents in the calendar of the Union and we\nwould have liked very much to have attended\nonce again, but, as Christians, we will be in\n\u2022Church at the time.\nWe cannot but express our deepest disappointment that it was not found expedient\nto hold this celebration a day ea lier, just as\nin other parts of the country, fireworks displays will be held on the Saturday evening.\nThis event, therefore, cannot be said to\nbe open to all members of the Union because\nit will be lacking in the support of many I.C Christians who y v ill be meeting with other\nlike minded people to worship the Lord and\nGiver of all true Happiness, who set this day\napart as a hallowed day.\nYours sincerely,\nOwen Davies, John Vernon, John Hulbert,\nMichael Averill, R.H. Sargeant, Segun\nSowunmi, A. J. Martin, F.C. Brown, C Wetter, D.L. Barlett, J. Ff. Evans, Samuel\nTewungwa, S.W. Aaron.\nDear Sir,\nIn a recent issue of your excel ent periodical you published a non-committal article on\nthe Union refectories. Whilst respecting your\nneutral is tic politics. I feel that a strong protest must be made through your columns with\nregard to the evening meal facilities. Everyone who, on economic grounds or otherwise,\nhas had the misfortune to eat in the lower\nrefectory after six o 'clock knows that it is impossible to obtain a meal without a fifteen or\ntwenty minute wait if he wishes to have the\nfull range of dishes on,the menu from which\nto select. There is only one answer, namely\nthe upper refectory must be opened in the\nevening. The fact that Ayrton Hall, where the\nmeals are cold anyway due to lack of a hot-plate, is open, is of little importance as no\ncivilised person wants his evening meal at five\no 'clock, and on Tuesdays and Thursdays all\nconscientious students are working until five-thirty.\nYours faithfully,\nDUNCAN DOUGLASS, ME CH. ENG. .2\nDear Sir,\nI had intended writing an idiot-type letter\nabout the number of noms de plume in last\nweek's letter page. Two obviously, who are\ncowards and a third signed incorrectly. This\nwas until I saw on the Union notice board\na request for the actual names of two more\nnoms de plume, one obviously offensive since\nit is referred to ai a nom de guerre.\nHas no-one in this College the strength of\nmind to write an unpopular letter and actually to claim ownership\"} Surely, if one has\na different point of view and takes the trouble\nto put it down on paper, then one should\nexpect to be able to be argued with \"face\nto face\" as it were, instead of through a forest of noms de pi ume, noms de guerre, and\nnoms de cowardice. I was going to sign this\nletter, \"Disgusted, Weeks Hall\", but now in\nrebellion I sign it,\nYours, ashamed of the spirit of this College,\nJOHN WHITE\nDear Sir,\nThere are several points arising from\nFelix No. 165 which I feel I must comment\non. Although agreeing with your general\ncomments on refectories I feel I must point\nout that Ayrton Hall has been used to more\nthan capacity over the last fortnight and I cannot see it easing the load on the Union\nfacilities to any great extent.\nSecondly, spelling. I have noticed some\nappalling mistakes on notices about the place\nand I was ready to comment on this when\nFelix himself let me down on the front page\\\nThirdly, the letters page. I agree with Mr.\nThomas to the point of disliking \"filthy\"\nsongs, but I feel that he should reserve his\njudgement: some folk overburdened with work\nrequire to let of steam and the bar is as good\na place as any. And what is wrong with the\ntop chop-house bar which is usually available\non hop nights!\nNow what is Irate Guildsman on about!\nWhy doesn't he try to arouse enthusiasm in\nhis own department instead of getting at\nChem. Eng. Cave ursa Yogi\\\nR.A. STOCK, Chem. Eng. 2\nDear Sir.\nIt has recently come to my notice that the\nRefectory Committee has raised the price of\nFreshers' Teas from ls.6d. per head to 2s. This was done without notifying any of the\nclubs or societies of the Union, and consequently the majority of the so cie ties ordered\n\\the$r Freshers' Teas on the understanding\nthat they would cost ls.6d. each. Now the\nbills have come in, and Mn. Mooney has\npresented all the societies with bills 33%\nmore than what they had estimated for.\nWhy were the societies told that the\nFreshers' Teas had not changed in price, and\nwhy it is that only now, after all the teas\nhave been eaten, are Mr. Mooney's staff told\nof the increase!\nYours querying,\nP.C. YOUNG EDITOR'S NOTES.\nMr. Mooney informs us that the matter\nwas brought up at a Refectory Committee\nmeeting last June at which the constituent\nCollege Presidents were present. He feels that\nthe onus was upon them to inform their societies and the societies to inquire first about\nthe prices.\nDear Sir,\nRarely am I moved to express feelings of\nindignation in the columns of the Press, but\nan item in the last issue of Felix has aroused\nmy ire.\nI refer to the words attributed to a well-known ICWArian in Comments of the Week,\nnamely, \"The Freshers' look like a weedy lot\nthis year.\" I read this item one morning as I was dressing, and I can only say that I was\nso overcome as to be completely unable to do\nup the buttons of my liberty b of tice. Yours faithfully,\nG. L.E. LOCKE, AERO 1.\n\\Sir,\nSome serious allegations have been made\nin the last week's edition of Sennet about the\nconduct of the I.C. Council. The suggestion\nis made that the disbanding, of the I.C. Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was achieved\nin a thoroughly suspicious and reprehensible\nmanner \u2014 indeed perhaps from political mot-ives.\nReports such as these, whether true or false,\ndo no good at all to the name of our College.\nWhat is more, they are very likely to be believed if the present Council in sits on being\ndilatory and evasive about the whole affair.\nThe course of action necessary is quite clear;\nif an injustice, intentional or not, was done to\nthe I.C.C. N.D. then they should be reinstated\nimmediately and a poli gies made: if, on the\nother hand, there was good cause for this act-ion, then the facts should be made public without delay.\nThe matter is one which is quite independent of any likes or dislikes which may be left\nfor the C. N.D.; if the allegations in Sennet are\ncorrect, then a precedent has been created for\nthe interference by Council in the affairs of\nany of those I.C. societies which it happens\nto dislike. Such conduct is clearly intolerable.\nThe seriousness of Sennet's claims war-rants,! think, a personal statement from the\nUnion President.\nYours faithfully,\nDONALD PEARSON\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Far from being dilatory and evasive, Council can say nothing until the minutes of the last\nCouncil meeting have been passed as a true\nand correct record. The next Council meeting\nis next Thursday, after which the minutes of\nthe meeting in question will be published on\nthe notice board.\nDear Sir,\nI note with concern Mr. A. Wellwisher's concern over the influx of a large number\nof young ladies into the College. His remark\nabout yellow women is particularly offensive,\nand he displays generally a most un chi val rous attitude to our filles nouvelles. The tone\nof this letter leads me to believe that he is\nembittered towards the fair sex; why, I just\ncannot fathom.\nYours faithfully,\n45-39-46\nP.S.

While the ladies were\nprepared, the Entertainments Committee\nChairman, Eddie Thornber, attempted to\njustify his existence and appealed for\nhelpers. To desultory toot ling s on a trumpet\nby the Secretary, the Queen of Jez. candidates\nparaded to thunderous applause.

    "content": "FELIX by COLCUTT\nIt seems that my comments about the\nfresher s showing their true worth at fresher s' dinners has been justified, providing that we\nassume that some fresher s have been concerned in the recent happenings. The President\nof the R. C.SU. was invited to a Guild's fresher s dinner, quite the usual practice. This\nsort of invitation usually secures your personal safety, after all, you are then a guest of\nthe host Union, but the President of the\nR. C.S.U. lost his trousers. Precisely what he\ndid to arouse the wrath of the militant Guildsmen cannot be determined, but this em baras s ment was rapidly followed at succeeding\ndinners by the removal of the trousers of\nthe Secretary of the I.C. Union and the President of the R.S. M. Union. One can appreciate the humour of de bagging the President\nof R.C.S. and the Secretary of I.C., especially\nif the President of R.C.S. was his visual vivacious self, these sights being funny any time\nand particularly when one is slightly inebriated, but the de bagging of the President fR.S. M. is a considerable feat, even if he has to\nbe first rendered insensible. The imagination,\nhowever, boggles at the act of a party of Mines\nfresher s. Perhaps, we can be generous and say\nthat the breaking of the small yard was the\nmain cause, after all, drinking 2\\ (??) pints\nat a swallow is an awful lot, but to go into\nthe cloakroom, remove all the coats from the\nhangers, tear off all the hanger-number tags,\nand then to pile the hangers in a heap on the\nfloor indicates a mentality unworthy of five-year-old children.\nThe signature of G. Thomas (Phys. 1.) appended to the letter advocating temperance at\nI.C. provoked considerable speculation. It has\nbeen suggested that he is the brother of Dennis\nThomas (D.T.' s) that renowned ex-captain of\nI.C. and the Saracens.\nRumours have been heard that the President\nof R.C.S and some of his hierarchy wish to\nremove the Silwood Ball from the College social calendar and substitute for it yet another\n\"Grand Ball\" to join the ranks of the Comment.\nBall and the May Ball. The main reasons for\nthis seem to be the difficulty of organisation\ninvolved in the Silwood Ball and the fact that\nthere are nearly 1,000 students in R.C.S. and\nonly 100 can be accommodated at Silwood.\nOne shudders at the thought of Hammersmith\nPalais or the Carlton Rooms, Maida Vale (both\nproposed venues) being substituted for the relaxed formality and \"difference\" of the Silwood Ball \u2014 judged b v many > be the most\nenjoyable function of the year.\nI read that L.S.E. are very keen to form a Press Council for the control of all student\npublications, to correspond to the National\nPress Council. This seems to be yet another\nnational Student body for which there is little\npurpose and no demand; and if it does correspond to the National Press Council, to judge\nby the Spectator's comments (\"an entirely comic body\") it will be one more source of mirth.\nFlagging fresher s who feel that after three\nweeks of term their ambitions in the academic field are fading, should take a stroll along\nBond Street. There, displayed in all their glory,\nin the window of a photographer, are the likenesses of some distinguished Fellows of the\nRoyal Society. The largest and most prominently displayed is of our own Prof. P.M.S. B. looking his usual handsome self; in fact a lady\nacquaintance of mine finds it difficult to decide which attracts her most, the Prof, or the\nP.R.S. himself \u2014 \"they are both so sauve\".\nPerhaps, the James-Bond-type looks of the\nProf, give him a slight advantage but the\noverwhelming scholarship of the P.R.S.( Read 'War and Peace' in Russian 'n' times)\ncannot be ignored \u2014 second opinion welcome in this beau de Royal Society competition. Ben Hindley's sport XI( the Soccer Club's ex-seventh team) were somewhat amazed last\nweek to find that when they crawled onto the\nfield to play a B.B.C. sport XI( supposedly\nthe B.B.C. fifth XI) there was a very officious looking London Association rte fer ce waiting' for them. This resulted in the last\nyear's chairman of the A. C.p. having the\nsingular experience of being sent off the field\nbefore the game started.\nREMEMBER REMEMBER\nIOVEMBER 5th Dancing: 7.00 p.m. \u2014 10.00 p.m. Bonefire: 8.15 p.m. Fireworks: 8.45 p.m. TICKETS 2s.6d. including transport.\nHotdogs and Bar all evening.\n-Coaches leave the Union: 6.00-6.30 p.m. Return from: 9.30 p.m. TICKETS ON SALE IN UNION OFFICE TUESDAY 12.45 LIMITED TO TWO SINGLE TICKETS\nPER APPLICANT.\nCAROLINE RUSSELL\nMiss Carolyn Russell, the recently elected\nPresident of ICWA, first came to Imperial\nCollege two years ago to study Metallurgy.\nCarolyn comes from Poyton in Cheshire and\nwas edc atu ed at Macclesfield County High\nSchool for Girls. Having become in nu red to\nthe peculiar position of women at this College (she was the only girl in her department\nin her first year), she appeared in two Dramatic Society plays and went on tour with the\nSociety. She has also swum for I.C. W.S.C. and performed creditably in the Shrove Tuesday IC WAv. Exec. pancake race.\nOf 1CW A itself, Carolyn thinks'that it is\nessential to the College, mainly because it can\nmake the women feel at home here and prevent them from being completely isolated. As\nfor the perennial question of women in the\nbar, she shrewdly points out that no woman\nshould cer have to buy herself a drink, and\nhaving nad it bought for her she prefers to\ndrink it in the* lounge.\nCarolyn agrees that from the social point\nof view the number of girls in the College is\nfar from ideal, but adds that often members\nof ICWA are not invited out by the men because they automatically assume that someone else will have invited them first.\nHobbies? The theatre mainly and not much\ntime for anything else, what with work and\nICWA and the high life generally \u2014 and of\ncourse there is a well-known Guildsman in\nher life. To sum up, Carolyn is t harming and vivacious, very feminine, and with views\nof her own. She should make a great success\nof being President of ICWA this year.\nAPOLOGIES We must apologise for an error in the news\nitem headed \"Bookstall Changes\" in the last\nissue of Felix. The Chairman of the Bookstall Committee is Mr. R.H. Harris of the\nMetallurgy Department and Dr. J. L. Knill\nof the Geology Department has been recently\nappointed to the Committee.\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT RUGBY CLUB The Rugby Club has started the season in\nfine form the l st XV winning 3 out of their\n4 first games, scoring 58 points to 28 pts, but\nthe Ex. l st have lost one out of 2 games and\nthe A. XV have lost their only game. But t.> far none of the B. XV's have lost a game.\nThe Bl, Lydon's mob, have won 24 pts. ro\n3 and 32 pts. to 6, the second win being\nspoilt only by the fact the B2\"s. \"Ex-Jim's Team\" won the first game against Camberley A. by 33 pts. to 3, the team including\na \"useful newcomer\", T. Wright' Btit the\nbest record to date belongs to Chris Head'sB3 who in 2 matches have scored 70 pts.\nwithout reply.\nLast Friday, a team from Delft University\nwas entertained by R.C.S. who fielded a i strong slide, including guests from {both\nGuilds and Mines. This side proved much\ntoo experienced for their visitors and won by\n54 pts. to 6. The Delft side played hard and\nnever gave up trying, showing they would\nmake a very useful side when they have had\nmore practice, and it is hoped that this game\nhelped them to that end. Delft were a very\nfriendly side and many of those playing on\nFriday are looking forward to Easter when\na team from RC.S and Guilds will visit\nDelft.\nThere are 2 dates worthy of notice by those\ninterested in Rugby. On Nov. 4th the club\nhas one of its hardest fixtures against Richmond Vikings at Harlington, when a strong\nI.C. team will be fielded. Turn out and support the team if you are not playing, as they\nwill appreciate it very much. On the evening\nof Nov. 6th, the club will have a social evening when beer and sausage rolls will be\nserved. There will also be a film show, so\nplease take this opportunity of meeting the\nrest of the club.\nIt would be a great help to the officials if\nplayers ticked off as early as possible in the\nweek at least before Thursday. Also\nplease look at the board on Friday afternoon to check whether you have moved up\nand if you have, tick off again.\nSOCCERCLUB The season has got off to the usual moderate start, and after four playing days the\n3rd XI have an unbeaten record, however,\nthe 4th have yet to win.\nThe last XI beat a weak Barclays Bank\nXI(52) in the l st game of the season. Max\nFinney scoring all 5, but this result flattered\nonly to deceive as the next 2 games were lost.\nWhile the potential of the team is obviously good, the vital spark is missing which, it\nis hoped will appear for the first league game\nnext Wednesday. The 2nd XI have lost only\nonce to Southampton University. With 5 lively fresher s in the team, this au gprs well for\nthe future both on and off the field. The\nGlorious Thirds may prove to be the outstanding team at I.C. this season if their present\nform continues. The 4,th XI have not yet\nfound a good formation, although they did\nachieve a draw against LSE III, a week after\nbeing beaten 7-1 by LSE IV. The 5th XI have\nlost only once in their four friendly games.\nPerhaps, 4th XI permitting, they will get promotion this season. The 6th, starting off with\nalmost the same team as last season, are achieving similar results, i.e. they have won one\ngame out of four so far. The 7th team have\nstarted off fairly well on the field (if that's important). Their forte seems to have become\npost-match activity on a scale competing with\nthat Extra VII's. The Extra Vlth's consumption has now reached 8 pints per match, as\ncompared to 0.5 goals per men per match\nc once ede d. Carry on Ben's Men! The general club spirit seems to be more in evidence\nthan in previous years. This may be due to\nthe good set of 'sports' fresher s who have\njoined our ranks. It is hoped that this spirit\nwill continue throughout the season.\nHOCKEY CLUB The first event on the hockey calendar,\nthe trials, were blessed with exceptionally\ngood weather, and uncovered a good proportion of fine talent among the new mem-be rs. At the start of the term things looked\nblack for the l st XI, with only four of last\nyear's team available. But with the return of\nthree members, Ron King, Sean Galbally and\nSham and some very promising fresher s, we\nhave the making of a good team. After a rather shaky start against Vickers-Armstrong,\nwhom we beat by an own goal, the team\nplayed better to beat St. Barts Hospital, 4-0\nand to maintain their unbeaten record with\na11 draw against Burnt Ash.\nThe second XI, under the vivacious captaincy of Cas Anolick, narrowly lost to Northampton College l st XI,23, but came back\nwith are soun id in gf63 win over the Institute\nof Education, Anolick collecting a hat-trick.\nLondon Bible College were the 3rd XI's first fixture, played in Regent's Park. The result was a22 draw i, wii th guest member\nKeith Murden giving an impressive display\nin goal. In the second match, however, the\nteam was beaten 6-2 by Hounslow IV. The\n4th XI suffered our greatest defeat against\nImperial House 0-9, but gained a draw with\nMeadhurst, 1-1. Obviously Ged Birough at\nfull-back is beginning to find his feet in the\ngame.\nLast Friday we had our traditional s a us age-and-mash beer up, which, unfortunately,\nwas not well attended by the fresher s. However, those who did attend showed that the\nclub has a solid core of 'sportsmen' who will\nbe able to entertain our friends from Groningen at Lowestoft next Easter in the traditional manner.\nThe most depressing aspect of the season\nso far has been the poor ticking off habits\nof the new members. Of the 30 who turned\nup to the trials, only half make regular visits to the club board \u2014 which has now been\nmoved to the Cricket board, next to the bar.\nIf this state of affairs does not improve, we\nwill have difficulty in fielding four teams in\ncoming weeks.\nD. PHILLIPS\nCROSSCOUNTRY CLUB In preparation for their first big match of\nthe season, the UC invitation relay, the club\nturned out on Wednesday 11th with Borough\nRoad Teachers Training College, and St.\nBarts. teams for a1 lap jog followed by 1\nlap at speed (?). The IC first team (49) out-pointed Borough Road (79) and S|t. Barts\n(85), while IC second team got 101.\nThe 6x1.8U C relay took place on Sat.\n14th under perfect weather and ground con-ditions. IC had a fine turn out, entering four\nteams. With strong), competition from Birmingham, Sheffield and Loughborough to contend with, IC l st team handed over after the\nfirst leg in 8th position, and a fine run by\nDave Hammonds in the second leg brought\nI.C. up to fourth. Jim Bernard ended in\nthird place to Birmingham and Lougnborougfi,\nwith LSE and Borough Road fourth and\nfifth. The next leg, however, saw Miles of\nBorough Road take the fastest lap of the\nday and move up to third. Not even the combined efforts of Ted Wilkins and John Cleator\n(who turned in the fourth fastest time) could\nchange the situation and the final result was:\n1. Birmingham \u2014 50.38\n2. Loughborough \u2014 51.20\n3. Borough Road \u2014 51.53\n4. I.C.I \u2014 51.56\n15. I.C. II \u2014 55.50\n21. I. C.Ill \u2014 58.14\n31. I.C. TV \u2014 60.58\nOn Wed. 18th the IC l st at home to RAF, Hatton, had a resounding victory (23-35).\nJohn Collins took the honours with 25.02 in\nvery windy conditions. However, the 2nd team, away to Kings 2nd(?) at Mitcham,\nwere beaten into the dust by the full Kings\nl st team, four members being lost somewhere\nbetween the railway lines and cabbage patches\nwhich surround the Mitcham course.\nThe Annual Mob Match, UL v. Poly, incorporating the UL trials, was held over 2\nlarge laps at Hampstead Heath on Saturday\n21st. There is little doubt that IC l st team\nwalked away with League I having 5 in the\nls t15UL runners. The fate of the 2nd.3 rd and 4th in League II is as vet unknown,\nthough some fine improvements from Peter\nMoss and Graham Locke indicated the growing strength of the lower teams. However,\nfrom results, our own road relay organiser\nmust have forgotten that one runs as well\nas organizes races.\nBASKETBALL The club started the season with a win\nover U.C. at the U.L. U. court. However, it\nwas a hollow victory as U.C. arrived with\na deplete team. We lent them one man and\nthen proceeded to thrash them soundly to the\nscore of 68-26 (the man lent them scoring\n14 of their points). On Friday, 20th, the club\nplayed its first game of the London League\nagainst a supposedly strong team from Eastham. The match was fast and exciting with\nthe I.C. team (known as the IMPS) holding\ntheir own throughout. Astute team changing brou jr ht the tallest line-up IC has ever\nfielded with an average height of about 6'4\".\nThe IMPS piled on the pressure and made\nsure of success, winning score being 55-36. John\nRupf, one of the wings, played an outstanding game totalling 17 points and leading the\nattack brilliantly.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College, London, S.W.7.

    "content": "MOTOR CLUB BEN NEVIS RACE(1961) BADMINTON To Guildsmen this year November 5th has more significance than just being Guy\nFawkes' night. For early on that Sunday\nmorning, Boanerges, the President's official\ncarriage will be leaving Hyde Park on the\nrun organised by the Veteran Car Club.\nBoanerges is our five-seater James and\nBrowne phaeton, first seen on the road in\n1902, and with more unusual characteristics\nthan we can enumerate here. He has made\nthe Run .almost every year since the war\nand undoubtedly one of the most memorable\nwas two years ago. Bo was running on one\ncylinder instead of the intended two, and it\nwas only by sheer force of numbers and\nstrength of Guildsmen that he arrived in\nBrighton in time to collect his pennant from\nthe V. C.C. for successfully completing the\n57 mile run. The radiator consumed 40\ngallons of water and the Guildsmen an equal\nquantity of beer.\nThis year we anticipate a less energetic\ntrip and hope to arrive at Clarges' Hotel in\ntime for the traditional dinner organised b v the C.&G. Motor Club. To this R.C.S. also bring Jez, for whom the journey is\nrather more hazardous as she does not enjoy\nthe same privileges as the veteran cars. All members and guests are welcome to the dinner and details may be obtained from the\nClub notice board, or from any member of\nthe committee.\nWe hope that more than the usual number of Guildsmen (and women) will get up\nearly to cheer Bo and the President out of\nthe Park, and that those with transport will\nwelcome him at the parade at Brighton.\nThe Motor Club seems set for a record\nyear. At their first meeting of this session\nRoom 542 in the E.l block was filled to\ncapacity for the films \"1955 Belgian Grand\nPrix\" and \"B.R.M.1960\", and over one\nhundred members have paid their subscriptions. DEBATING SOCIETY\nThe Debating Society opened its programme a week last Tuesday when the\nmotion before the house was 'That this\nhouse considers drink a necessary evil'. The\nhouse numbered only 80 which was very disappointing especially considering the standard\nof speaking both from the platform and the\nfloor.\nThe main speakers, Messrs. Sullivan, Carter,\nHills and White, dealt with the motion in\na humorous vein, the topic of sex being\nbrought in more than the motion under deb-ate, Siough this can be said of most debates.\nNevertheless the speeches were good and very\nfunny. I am sure that those who spent their\nlunch time in an over crowded lounge waiting for the next lecture would have found\nthe walk to the Concert Hall well Iworth\nwhile.\nThe speeches from the floor were on the\nwhole in a much more serious mood, and\nmany speakers brought out the evils of misuse of alcohol very convincingly, but the\ncommon mistake was not to stick directly\nto the motion. Both the number and standard\nof the speeches were s uprising ly good and one\nhopes that more people will come along to\ndebates and turn their tongues to debating.\nThe Society will compete in the first round\nof the UL U Debating Competition next week.\nThe debate will be at home and our visitors\nwill be the 'School of Slavonic and East\nEuropean Studies', while the motion before\nthe house will be \"Rule Britannia*. The time\nand place will be announced later. Your support would be greatly appreciated.\nIC Cross County Club have at last proved\nthemselves mad enough b v entering a team\nfor the Ben Nevis Race. Of the five men in\nthe IC team who faced the starter on September 2nd, Mike Heck, Jim Smith (both\nLSE) and Ian Linklater hailed from the Lake\nDistrict after success in the 40 mile 'Big-J run; {Ted Wilkins was fresh from London;\nand John Cleator not so fresh from Skye.\nThe race is variously reported as 10 or 14\nmiles. But the horizontal distance is meaningless when there are 4406 agonising vertical feet to climb and descend. The ,race\nstarts in Fort William and there is a2 mile\nstretch of road before the mountain \"bridle-path\" is reached. The route to the summit is\noptional; and as a direct result, the local runners always do better than is expected of\nthem. It is a highly specialised type of rac-ing' demanding exceptional Sitamina on the\nascent, and great technique on the race-win-nine descent.\nAbout 140 started the race, including man v of the biggest names in long distance and\nmountain running. The winner's time was\n1hr.48 mins. Mike Heck was 32nd in 2 hours\n7 minutes, while Ian Linklater and Jim Smith\nraced in together in tv pica l fashion in 2hrs.20 mins. Ted Wilkins, however, missed the\nshort cut in the thick mist and violent thunderstorm of the descent. Although only 3 people\npassed him on the wav down, he dropped\nfrom 50th to 80th and to a time of 2hrs27 mins. John Cleator had a similar misfortune.\nFive hundred feet below the summit, his run-nig shoes gave out and after throwing them\ndown the hillside, he completed the descent\nin bare feet.\nCrossword by REGUS\nCLUES: ACROSS.\n1.
