Dave Lenherr\nPenny Howard\nEDITORIAL\nA new term, a new year, and a welcome back to all our readers\nfrom the Felix staff. It was hoped that we would have some new\nrefectories as well, but apparently for reasons best known to them-selves, the contractors have still not finished the South Side building.\nApparently, the architects' new year resolution is to \" wait and see.\"\n1 fiat is all that we can do unfortunately.\nA new feature of FELIX this term is the Carnival Page. The\n1963 Charity Carnival is on the way, and from now until May, there\nwill be a regular space reserved for Carnival news, progress of various\nwork done, and last but not least, profiles of prospective Carnival\nQueens. All the best carnivals have queens, and this is no exception,\nso that if there is a pretty girl in your year, here is a perfect opportunity to find out what her hobbies are\u2014\" it's all right, I'm writing\na profile of you for Felix.\" Profiles should not be longer than 200\nwords, and photographs should be 2Jin.x4 in. If necessary, photos\ncan be taken by the Felix photographers.\nFinally, FELIX would like to apologise to Don Pearson for a gaffe in the last issue of last term. The article on NUS, replying to\nJohn Preece's article was written by Don Pearson, whose name was\nunfortunately omitted due to a printer's error. It was certainly not\nhis intention that the article should appear anonymously.\nCOLCUTT\nThe completion date of South\nSide seems to be further away\nthan ever. The Hostel accommodation, which was originally\nsupposed to be ready for last\nOctober, will not be ready until\nnext term, and it now seems likely\nthat the refectories will not be\nready till Easter. Many people\nwill not be prepared to move into\nHall for the last crucial examination term, so the Halls may have\na dismal half-full first term. The\nrefectory situation now seems to\nbe desperate ; judging by the\nnumber of bitter complaints in\nthe Suggestions book, a large\nnumber of people are fed up with\nthe meals being dished up. Of\ncourse, the kitchens are hopelessly overloaded, so we cannot\nexpect Mr. Mooney to maintain\na high standard, but the Suggestions Book seems to be the only\nway that the consumer can register protest. It is to be hoped that\nthese are being passed on to whoever is responsible for the deplorable hold-up on South Side.\nThe South Side hold-up is by\nno means unique in the College.\nThe same thing is happening at\nHarlington, where the contractors\nare now almost four months be-hind, with the changing room ex-tension. The new hot water system which was to have been put\nin over the Christmas vacation is\nItill not ready. Perhaps it is fortunate that the pitches are unfit\nfor \"play, otherwise games would\nhave been cancelled for lack of\nwashing facilities.\nYet another date to be put\nback is the next Union Meeting.\nThis will now be held on January\n29th in the Royal Geographical\nSociety's Hall, the extra accommodation being made available\nfor the NUS Debate. Bob Finch,\nwho is proposing the motion that\nwe should join will officially be\non his honeymoon, but intends to\nbe present at the meeting. Such\ndevotion to the welfare (?) of the\nUnion is indeed surprising.\nPhoenix arrived in time for the\nend of the last term after all. It\ndid not sell as well as expected,\nand made a loss of some \u00a330.\nThe most disappointing feature of\nthis magazine is the lack of contributions from the members of\nthe Unio.i. If the President had\nnot mislaid his diary, the only\ncontributions from the present\nstudent body would have been\nthe Social and Athletics reviews\nand the Editor's contributions.\nIncidentally, these three writers\nall work in the same research\ngroup. Surely there are other\npeople in the College who are\ncapable and interested enough to\nw ri+e articles for Phoenix. The\nnext issue will be out later this\nterm and it is still not too late\nfor contributions\u2014so get a pen\nout and writs.\n\u00a3el te*6 to the bt it ox Dear Sir,\nIt is unfortunate that the\narticle: \"N.U.S. \u2014YES OR NO,\"\nwas published in the final issue\nof last term's paper since most\npeople will be unable to remember\nthe substance and form of this\ndisgusting piece of literature. The\narticle inadequately attempted to\nanswer some of the criticisms of\nN.U.S. put forward by John\nPreece in the pre vous issue of\nFelix. The writer argued that because we give \u00a35,000 out of the\nreserves towards the new sports\ncentre and send teams occasionally on tour, we can therefore\nafford to join N.U.S. I would\nmerely ask which would benefit\nthe students of this College more :\nspending our limited resources on\nthe above, or sending seven delegates to N.U.S. Conferences and\nour -membership thereof (about\n\u00a3300-^ 100 per annum). He then\ngoes on to say that he realises\nour financial situation is difficult\nand that the solution lies in raising Union fees. Until then an\n\" interim solution will have to be\nfound.\"\nIt is about time the writer recognised the fact that we are\npowerless to raise Union fees, and\nlong before he suggested doing so,\nurgent approaches were being\nmade to the proper authorities\nwith such a goal in mind. The\nUnion has been told that its fees\ncannot be raised for at least three,\nand probably five, years. I should\nbe interested to learn the writer's\" interim so luton.\" My main objection to the\narticle, however, is that it is nothing more than \"a protracted\npersonal attack on John Preece.\nIf we are to be regaled with more\nof these pro-N.U.S.( or, for that\nmatter, anti-N.U.S.) epistles, then\nI suggest that personalities be\nomitted. In conclusion, it suffices\nto say that John Preece put his\nname to his own article, whilst\nthe reply appears to be anonymous\u2014(though we can guess its\norigin).\nYours,\nCHRIS LIDDLE.\nEDITOR'S NOTE.\nThe article became \" anonymous \" due to a printers' error.\nAs mentioned elsewhere, it was\nsubmitted by Don Pearson, to\nwhom the Ed. has already ex-pre sed apologies.\nDear Sir,\nI have been greatly surprised\nto find that IC students do not\nwear academic gowns to lectures\nand important ceremonies such as\nCommemoration Day.\nIn my country, Nigeria, it is\nthe custom for College and Untverstiy Students to wear gowns.,\nand these are worn in some\nColleges here, notably in Kings\nCollege. Why should not IC join\nin the practise. As \" Britain's leading University College\" (a newspaper description of IC) we\nshould show the light for other\nColleges to follow.\nAn undergraduate gown is\ncheap, about \u00a33, so that there is\nno question of some students not\nbeing able to afford it. Apart\nfrom the cost, it is reasonable to\nregard the gown as a symbol of\nUniversity or College studentship;\nclad in a gown, students would\ntend to behave in a more responsible fashion.\nCould this matter not be jo oke d into by the College and Union\nofficers ?\nYours faithfully,\nM.A.A. Aero IN. U.S., Education and Student\nWelfare.\nThere have been several interesting articles on the virtue of\nI.C.U. affiliating itself to the National Union of Students. They\nhave discussed some of the aspects of N.U.S. and its services\nto students and one of the most\nimportant of these is the department of N.U.S. which deals with\nEducation and Welfare.\nMany students regard the comments of their fellows on Education as immature and governed\nby a desire to be heard rather than\na desire to state reasoned opinions.\nThere is some truth in this attitude but the reasoned student\nopinion on the education being\nprovided in the Universities and\nColleges of England, Wales and\nNorthern Ireland does fill a void\nand which some education a lists admit is an important contribution to the development of..Edu-cation'\"' The customers are commenting on the goods offered, a not uncommon practice in the\ncommercial world.\nThe National Union of Students\nhas over the last few years presented the opinion of ts members\nto several Government Committees specifically detailed to examine the British Higher Educational System and allied problems.\nThe evidence of N.U.S. presented\nto the Robbins Committee was a well balanced account of student\nopinion on prevailing conditions\nand what it considered to be\nfuture needs. In this evidence\nwere inter alia, statements requesting a better preparation of sixth\nformer s for University life, less\nemphasis on total knowledge acquired in the University undergraduate courses and more on real\neducation, the provision of more\nHalls of Residence, to be communities not simply an agglomeration of bed-sitters and the fundamental statement that all people\nqualified and able to benefit from\na course of higher education\nshould be able to do so. Memoranda on Teaching methods in\nUniversities and on Safety Provisions in Institutions of Higher\nEducation were also accepted as a\\ "

We fought our way\nthrough the teeth of the blizzard\nup the final snow field. Intrepid\nand undaunted, we emerged victorious on the plateau of Ben\nNevis. The moon was rising high\nover the distant lights of the\nClachaig Hotel. Only two hours\nto opening time, an incentive to\ndrive on even the most exhausted.\nWe rushed headlong (literally)\ndown the snow slopes to the tan-ta lising lights.

As the delirium was wearing off, he realised that time was\nrunning out. Leaping to his feet\nhe promptly fell another fifty\nyards and, unruffled, set off in\npursuit of the rest of the party.\nIt was nine o 'clock when we\nreached the car.

    "content": "FELIX5 FILM REVIEWS\u2014cont\nTHE LONGEST DAY* k or \"How We Helped John Wayne\nWin the War.\"\nClosely following the book of\nthe same title, this film is an ac-curate-as-possible reconstruction\nof D Day. Despite the obvious\nattempts at authenticity, a certain amount of corn creeps in,\nwhich tends to lower the entertainment value. German and\nFrench forces speak in their respective languages, with subtitles,\nand this slows the action to some\nextent. The initial build up of\nforces on both sides of the Channel is excellently done, with a good representation of the personalities involved, the bicker-in gs, the patriotic ambitions of\nthe parties, but when the actual\nlandings take place and the fighting begins, the film lacks con-t inuit y. We see Robert Mitchum casually strolling up and down a body\nstrewn beach chewing a cigar,\nHenry Fonda limping around,\npretending to be Roosevelt Jnr.,\nKenneth More hoping the shelling will stop \" as it is making his\nbulldog nervous.\" By a haystack we have Richard Burton\nso lilo qui sing, and one half expects to see Liz poke her head\nthrough the straw. There is\nJerry Lewis type sequence with\nsquads of German soldiers passing squads of Americans, neither\nrecognising the \" enemy.\" To top\nit all. we have Sean \" James\nBond\" Connery, as an Irish\nprivate. Well, I ask you !\nAs entertainment, the \"Longest\nDay \" is one big bans, and one\nbig laugh from beginning to end.\nAs a serious motion picture, how-ever, it does not quite make the\ngrade.\nG.T. NEW RCS SOCIETY\n\u2014 PROPOSED\nASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY\nFORMED Some time last term, several\nmembers of the Royal College\nof Science came up with the idea\nof forming a society to further interest in Astronomy. The first\nmeeting was held at the end of\nlast term, and some fifty people\nattended. As a result, a committee is now in existence, and\nthe Society has applied for\nofficial recognition as an RCS\nSociety.\nArrangements are being made\nto acquire certain observational\nfacilities for members. It is hoped\nto have occasional use of the 20\ninch reflecting telescope housed\non top of the Science Museum\nextension, as well as one of the\nseveral smaller instruments.\nThe first lecture on the subject\nis being arranged for some time\nthis term, and anyone interested\nin joining should get in Jouch\nwith the Society via the Union\nRack.\nTHAT WAS THE NIGHT\nTHAT WAS\nOnce again, the more sober\ncharacters of I. C.,i.e., the Minesmen, were able to let their hair\ndown in an affair which brought\nthe term to a fitting conclusion.\nThe night began for many in various hostelries in and around the\nprecincts of the R.S. M., which no\ndoubt laid the foundations for a great deal of \" bon hom mie.\" To the accompaniment of a versatile band, a large flock of\npenguins partnered by scintillating birds mastered the intricacies\nof a tricky surface.\nFloral decoration, and a Keg\nvariety of \" flowers \" helped to\npromote a congenial atmosphere\nwhich persisted throughout the\nnight. An excellent buffet was\nfollowed by a cabaret which was\nsubtle in its manner and pleasingly free from vulgarity (Note,\nMr. Harris!). The jazz band\ntook over at 3 a.m. and the fact\nthat activities continued until 5.30\nwas a measure of the success of\na thoroughly enjoyable night.\nThanks are due to the Ents. Committee and the cabaret artistes(?)\nfor the able way in which they\neffected the arrangements.\nIt was very pleasing to have\nseveral members of staff present,\nand their lively participation was\nappreciated. It is to be hoped\nthat next year the Mines Ball as a formal function will become an\ninformal association for more\nstaff and students.\nRect-Hern\nNIGHTCLUBBING In this second article about high spots for the more discerning,\nit is intended to give a brief review of some dining and drinking clubs\nwhich are within the means of the average student.\nProbably one of the least expensive places for a drink in the\nWest End is \" Bev's Blenheim,\" situated off New Bond Street. Drinks\nhere are half price between 8 and 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays,\nand refreshments, in the form of continental snacks, are available.\nBev's is essentially the sort of place at which one soon gets to know\nthe \" mates,\" and then anything may happen\u2014from members' bar\ncompetitions to trips abroad. Although dress not have to be very\nformal, shirt and tie are advisable.\nA small and intimate club\nwhere one can wine, dine and\ndance, is the \"Living Room,\"\nsituated in the Notting Hill redevelopment area. The food is\ngood and inexpensive, and although the kitchen is under the\nsupervision of a French chef,\nsteaks and chicken-in-the-basket\n\" Southern Fried \" are the spec\ni ali ties of the house. There is an\nexcellent three-piece band, and, a definite atmosphere. Finally\nthere is a grand piano bar off\nwhich you can eat and drink.\nDress?\u2014Eounge suits.\nFor the more artistic, there is\nthe Rennaissance. in Harrington\nRoad. Kensington. Here one\ncan dine (steaks a speciality\u2014\ngood meal for about 15/-) and\ndance in an atmosphere of art\nand culture. A visit here should\nprovide an entertaining evening,\nand dress\u2014Kensington set arty\nget-up.\nFor students living south of\nthe river, a visit to the Toby\nGym, off the Old Kent Road,\nBermondsey, should provide\nsome interest on that spare even-ing. Both a club and a training\ngym, the Toby provides training\nquarters for many famous visiting\nboxers from overseas, and except\non Tuesdays, is very much alive\nwith a band and local star vocal-is ts. Dress is very informal.\nTurning to the West End again,\nthere is just room to mention two\nplaces. One of the oldest clubs\nin Soho is the Mandrake, \"almost\na night club without the host-esse s.\" The atmosphere is cosmopolitan and there are three\nbars, a dance room with aver v good band, and even a small\nch emmy room; chess is also\nplayed here. The Mandrake\nseems to be a meeting place for\nall the world, dress is informal,\nand the bar claims to stock over\n500 different drinks.\nFinally, a more salubrious establishment on Foley Street, the\nPaint Box (Club Tokyo). \" You\nmay sketch our models,\" says\nJimmy Mclure at the Paint Box.\nEverything is provided here\u2014\nfood, wine, women and music.\nThe haunt of rich, tired businessmen wanting to forget their worries (at the office and at home)\nin the exotic atmosphere.

    "content": "FELIX PROFILES\nSTAN\nTHE\nMAN\n\" The President, secretary, or any member of the Theospofficial\nSociety wanted in the main hall, please.\" The familiar voice intones\nthe time honoured formula over the Tannoy in the Union every\nlunchtime ; it belongs, of course, to the amiable Union porter, \" Stan\nthe Man.\" Stanley Branker was born in Barbados in 1918, and\nafter many travels to the four corners of the globe, finally ended up\nat IC, where he has become a familiar figure to all who use the\nUnion Buildings.\nAt school he studied classics,\nand eventually started his working life as a school teacher. Two\nyears of this, however, convinced\nhim that teaching was not the\ncareer for him, being neither\nlucrative nor sufficiently interesting to one who yearned for a more adventurous life. Far horizons were beckoning, and it was\nnatural that he should try his\nhand at a life afloat. His mother\nhad been a concert pianist, and\nStan himself had played the piano\nfrom an early age, so that he\njoined the Canadian National\nSteamship Line as a pianist on\ntheir luxury cruises. He sailed\nwith this line for some time and\nmanaged to see a great deal of\nthe world before his ship was torpedoed off Bermuda at the beginning of the war.\nThis seemed like a good cue for\na change of profession, and he\nwent to Curasol in the Dutch\nwent to Curasol in the Dutch\nWest Indies where he trained as a cracking unit operator with the\nShell Oil Company. After the war\nStan re-joined the Merchant\nNavy for a short time, but was\nsoon off again on his wanderings,\nthis time roaming about North\nAmerica, trying his hand at a variety of jobs, working for part\nof the time at his old trade, playing the piano in a night club.\nFinally, in 1955, he decided to\ncome to England. During his\ntailing days, Stan had visited\nmost of the world, and had come\ntp the conclusion that England\nwas the only place to live,\nweather notwithstanding. In fact,\nhe even admits to liking the weather here, especially the amount\nof variety. It seems fantastic,\nparticularly at this time of the\nyear, that anyone could possibly\nlike our weather, but I suppose\nthat it is possible to get tired of\nanything, even continual sun-shine.\nBefore coming to IC in 1959,\nStan worked for the Decca Radio\nand TV Company, and also\nmanaged to put in three years\npart time service with the Territorial Army. He has now:been\nour Union porter for three years,\nwhich for him is quite a long\ntime to stay anywhere, but says he\nquite likes it here. Even more\nsurprising is that he has quite a good opinion of students as a whole, though sometimes they\ncan be rather trying. He recalls\n\u2022the typical example of a young\nfemale voice trying to contact a young man named John via the\nUnion phone: \" Oh, is that Imperial College ? I want to speak\nto John.'\"\n\" Which John ?\"\n\" I don't know his name, but\nI think he is either a chemist or\na physicist, or something, average\nheight, medium build, and speaks\nwith a slight Welsh accent.\"\nA tall order, it must be agreed,\nyet somehow or other John is\nfound (sometimes) and other\nproblems like this one also\nmanage to get themselves solved\nwith the assistance of the man at\nthe Union door. Thanks Stan.\nTHEATRE\nTHE PHYSICISTS\nAt the Aldwych.\nReviewed by D. Farrell.\n\" The Physicists,\" a new play by the Swiss dramatist Friedrich\nDurrenmatt, had its British premier on January 9th, put on by the\nRoyal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych. Under the guise of a comedy, Durre'n matt has written a stylish, spiky parody of our times.\nThe form of the play is an example of \" compression is m,\" in which\nviolence and tension is produced by physically confining the characters and insulating them from society. This form, developed by\nStrindberg, Chekov and O 'Neille, seemed to be in danger of running\nto seed in Pinter and Becket (the latter's\" Happy Days \" is a very\nunhappy evening at the \" Royal Court\").\nWe are presented with three \u2014 \u2014physicists confined in a Swiss\nsanatorium, who display palpable\nsymptoms of madness, one thinking he is Newton, another Einstein. They kill their three Judotrained nurses in rapid succes-sion, and male boxing champions\nare substituted at great cost. We\nthen learn from Newton and Einstein that they are not mad, but\nin fact agents of rival govern-ment s, and that the third man is\nthe greatest genius in the field of\nphysics. This fellow has to admit\nthat he has been knocking off the\nTheory of Gravitation as a side-line, but badgering by the other\ntwo produces a reaction of high\nmoral dismay, in which he claims\nto prefer a madhouse to either of\ntheir prisons : he has burned his\nlittle trifle on gravitation and\nwouldnt' think of jeo pardi sing the\nvery existence of humanity by\npublishing it. Meanwhile, the\nwoman doctor in charge of the\nsanatorium reveals that she is\nmad, but has managed to make a photo-copy of the Gravitation\nTheory, and is going into mass\nproduction. (We are not told\nwhether this is of bombs or anti-gravity boots).\nAt this fait ac comp li, the physicists relapse into their palpable\nsymptoms of madness, and leave\nthe world in charge of the mad\nwoman psychiatrist.\nOn the comedy level, the play\nis quite successful: the first night\naudience chortled away happily\nat the droll effect of madness\nturned on and off Tike a Russ\nConway smile. However, unlike\n\" The Fireraisers \" by Durrenmatt's compatriot Max Frisch,\nthis play, for me, became rather\ntoo strongly polarised into farce\nand moral ising \u2014one had to readjust one's frame of mind from\nscene to scene, and this seemed to\nweaken the dramatic impulse.\nOn the moral level, however,\nthe play is really alive, and actually frames one or two judgments. The Gravity man who\nhas feigned madness to save the\nworld from his thoughts realizes\nhis stupidity\u2014-thought by its\nnature cannot remain the property of one man ; he can only\ndelay the pro ere s s of science by\nopting out. The woman doctor\nwho oozes compassion for humanity earlier on is self condemned (\" I couldn't love anybody in particular, so I decided\nto love humanity \").\nThis is decidedly a play worth\nseeing, and it brings the total of\nDurrenmatt plays presented in\nLondon to three (out of his eight\nstage plays); this is the man who\nis considered by many to be the\nleading dramatist of the German\nspeaking theatre.\nFILM\nMUTINY ON THE BOUNTY A costume-piece epic starring\nMarlon Brando as an Englisn\ndandy, made oy a previously-con-side red medio rc re director, is\nhardly going to raise much\nhopeful expectations in many\npeople's minds, but fortunately\n\"\" Mutiny on the Bounty \" proves\nto be one of the finest films made\nfor a long time.\nThe film's finest moments occur in the first part of the pic-ture. The meeting of Captain\nBligh (Trevor Howard) and\nChristian (Brando), his second\nin command, the preparation for\nthe voyage, the journey to Tahiti,\nbuild up a magnificent atmosphere. The dialogue in places is\nextremely funny, and the scenery\nis magnificent.\nOnce at Tahiti, the pace slows\ndown a bit, but the entertainment\nvalue remains. The scene where\nChristian is sent on a diplomatic\nmission (to make love to the\nchief's daughter), accompanied\nby the strains of \" Rule Britannia,\" is unforgettable, as is the\nscene where Bligh does a\" Knees\nup \" with some Tahitan va hines. Here again, the film scores once\nagain with breathtaking photography of the island.\nWith the setting sail of the\n\" Bounty \" the film loses some of\nits impact, and the actual mutiny\nscene, while con vicing enough,\nleaves one wondering if full use\nhad been made of the dramatic\npotential of two actors like\nBrando and Howard. The ending lacks finesse, with Christian\nas the big hero, without ever convincing us of the villa ny of Bligh.\nThis is in fact the main fault, an\nunconvincing villain. Unfortunately for Bounty, this problem of cruelty\u2014^rie ht or wrong,\nwas far more forcibly discussed\nin Billy Budd, but for sheer spectacle alone, the film is first class\nentertainment.\n\n"

SLOW PROGRESS\nSOUTH-SIDE\nNEARING\nCOMPLETION\n(ASYMPTOTICALLY)\nAt the end of last term, an\nofficial notice appeared on the\nCollege notice boards, stating\nwhat had been suspected all\nalong, that the Halls of Residence\non South Side will not be open in\nthe Easter Term, and that it was\nhoped that some of the accommodation will be available in the\nSummer Term. As a comparison\nof the accompanying photographs\nwith those printed in our second\nissue last term will show, there\ndoes not appear to have been\nmuch progress made since that\ntime, and it is hard to believe\nthat the refectories in South Side\nwhich were to be opening\n\" shortly \" will be ready this term\neither.\nThe only consoling thought\nabout all this is that \" better late\nthan never \"'\u2014South Side will\nstill be a boon to the College\nwhenever it finally opens (Oct.\n1963 ?)\nGORDON LOWE S The ideal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brampton Arcade,\nKnightsbridge, S.W.3 KEN4494/5/6 Huxlep Society Hen in\na Church Wedding\nBy our Special Reporter\nGENERAL STUDIES\nLECTURE \u2014\nIt has come to the attention of\nFELIX that Bob Finch, one of\nthe leading lights behind the\nNUS movement, and regular contributor to \" Scrutiny \" is not\nonly contemplating matrimony,\nbut is actually getting married in\nthe near future and in a church at that. What is even\nmore surprising is that his best\nman will be Don Pearson, the Student Orator who wasn't, because\nhe objected to various phrases of\na semi-religious nature in t 'ie declaration that he was to read out\non the occasion of last Commemoration Day. When asked\nabout his decision to participate,\nDon Pearson replied that he had\nbeen won over by the prospective bride.\nOne wonders if there would be\nany form of Humanist Society here\nif there was more than a sprinkling\nof the fair sex.

He then described the\nEmpire over which the tycoons\nrule; 11 million workers in the\nmanufacturing industries alone,\nwith an annual gross product of\n\u00a310,000 m.; and went on to examine more closely some characteristics of tycoon e ry. The genus\n\" tycoon \" is peculiar in that it\nexhibits strong suicidal tendencies ; more precisely it tends to\ndrown itself in a sea of paper.\nHe made a plea for restraint\namong scientists, \" who,\" he said,\n\"are particularly prone to using\nten long words where one short\none will do.\"\nDiscussing profits and wages he\nsaid that, despite many opinions\nto the contrary, there was no real\ndifference between a worker\nwanting more wages and a shareholder wanting an increased pro-fit. It would be far more sensible if both sides would work to\nincrease the total earnings of the\ncompany ; the way the cake was\nshared out afterwards would be\nan entirely separate matter.\nTycoons, he concluded, are\nreally necessary. They work extremely hard, and cheerfully\naccept enormous responsibilities.\nThey are more willing to accept\ninnovations than a committee,\nand are less prone to \" collective\ndishonesty \" which often characterises committee decisions.\nAnswering questions, he agreed\nthat the Unions were in a mess\nlargely due to their having too\nmuch power. The Common\nMarket will help to solve this\nproblem by diluting their power :\nthe Market will also be a wonderful thing for our country's economy. He expressed com-nle te confidence that British Industry \"will run rings round the\nfrog e ies.\" "

The second VIII\nretired after one stroke, \"Her-cu les\" Dean having broken his\nblade. Rumour has it that the\ncaptain was heartily thanked by\nthe whole crew, who as a result\nwere able to spend the remainder\nof the time in the bar.\nOf the remaining IC crews, the\n4th VIII stopped half way over\nthe course, as further progress\nwould have resulted in total im-mer sion. It being still eight hours\nto Sunday, this was decided to be\nuncalled for. The first eight decided on a similar plan of cam-pa ign, but left the decision to\nabandon the race till 100 yards\nfrom the finish.\nThe 3rd eight alone carried the\nflag through to the finish, but\nwere unable to win the barrel of\nbeer which went to the Thames\nfirst eight.\nAfter a considerable time spent\ndrying and warming the exterior,\nthe crews proceeded to moisten\ntheir interiors at the bar, prior to\nan excellent dinner, at which the\nmembers of Thames attempted to\nshow IC how to enjoy a Boat\nClub Dinner. The general opinion\nwas that in this field IC is un-beat able. G.P.

In October there was a large intake of fresher s, including\nmany with ability or enthusiasm, and if these new members can be\nencouraged to take an active part in running the club, the future\nlooks very promising.\nMeets started well at Ogiveri, with a lot of climbing. Llanberis\nand Stanage gave us all they had to offer in the way of bad weather,\nand some solid drinking. Back at Llanberis again (somewhat depleted in numbers) several members had notable successes in kinder\ncircumstances.\nOver the New Year a party\nof ten climbed and ski id in Glencoe. Conditions could have been\nbetter, but the snow experience\nwas valuable. It must be ad-mitte d, however, that on 1st January several members of the\nparty displayed a marked lack of\nkeenness!\nThis term we have another full\nprogramme of meets and lectures,\nand are also embarking on several new ventures.

Apart from\nsome newly released films there\nare two talks, one of which is by\nRaymond Baxter, the B.B.C. motoring commentator and rally\ndriver. The highlight is, of\ncourse, the annual dinner to\nwhich five motor racing drivers\nhave been invited including the\ntop lady driver, Christabel Carlisle.\nSo far only one factor v visit has\nbeen confirmed and that is to\nAston Martins at the beginning\nof February.\nSWIMMING\nDELFT SWIMMING TEAM VISIT IC\nIn the last match of term,\nagain the strong Delft University\nTeam, IC drew in the swimming,\n30-30, and lost the Polo 3-0. The\nfew spectators present were rewarded with perhaps the best\nPolo match played for some time.\nThe passing of both teams was\nquick and play see-sawed from\nend to end as attacking moves\ntested the agility of both goal-keepers.\nFrom the first encounter, it was\nobvious that Delft were shooting\nfar more strongly than IC, how-ever, tight defensive play mini-mise d this advantage. Towards\nthe end of the second quarter,\nDelft opened the scoring with a fine backhand shot from the right\nwing, and although IC pressed\nhard, they were unable to make\nmuch impression on the Delft\ngoalkeeper. Delft then went on\nto score two more goals, more by\ngood attacking than by defensive\nmistakes, and finished worthy\nwinners.\nUL U Water Polo League\nIC 1st against NCL won 4-3 (last\nyear's leaders).\nIC 2nd against Battersea, won\n5-1.\nHARDLY HANSARD\nCOUNCIL MEETING\nIt was with great pleasure that Felix received an invitation from\nthe President, Mr. Chandmal, to send an observer to the last Council\nmeeting of last term. The following report is submitted as a pre c is of a meeting which started at 5.45 p.m. and ended three hours later\nwith a toast in champagne, purchased privately by the executive,\ntreasurer and the three old student reps., to the one hundredth anniversary of the committee. It is an oft repeated cry that Council\n\" says much, and accomplishes little,\" possibly because a committee\nof Over twenty members must needs have difficulty in reaching agree-ment. Yet the impression received was that of this score, only a small proportion spoke needlessly, and at this particular meeting even\nthat was limited. they be swimmers, footballers, or\nThe meeting opened with some debaters. Mr. Chandmal reported that I.C. W.S.C. had been\nallowed a grant since they played\nevery known game\u2014\" cheap at\n\u00a310 a head.\" What game, or\nwhere they intended to play it\nwas amongst the classified information not yet released. Several\nreports in fact suffered from their\nconfidential nature, and the President expressed his wish that this\nshould not become general pra c tice. The Athletic Committee\nwas one report which came under\nthis category. After extensive\nmuttering about hilarious meetings and with many etc s. Mr.\nPhillips told of the acquisition of\na new all-weather golf net to be\nerected in one of the fives courts\nin Princes Gardens ; also a pavilion for the cross country club,\nsite not disclosed.\nThe General Studies Committee expressed themselves dissatisfied with the Exec's choice of\ndate for the next Union Meeting.\nThe day chosen was the same as\nthat on which Mr. Holroyd, an\nimportant speaker from I.C.I, had been invited to speak. This\nhad been achieved With some\ndifficulty and it was feared that\nthe N.U.S. debate at the Union\nmeeting would detract from his\naudience. Messrs. Phillips and\nGardiner were soon going in fine\nform with biting sarcasm and\npedantic quibbling ; the President\nand secretary were clearly not\nhappy about this attack, and as\nthe temperature rose, further\nmembers of council joined the\nredoubtable Phillips and Gardiner, perhaps feeling that the executive were not being as co-opera-ti ve as they might. It was left to\nDr. Weale to pour the oil and\nsuggest the motion \" that the\nExecutive reconsider its dec i sion.\" This was passed, and in\nview of the fact that many would\nwish to attend both factions it is\nhoped that the date of the Union\nmeeting will be changed.\nOf the fiasco of the New Halls\nof Residence, there is no need to\nwrite more\u2014-it is sincerely hoped\nthat members of the college are\nnot taking further FINAL dates\ntoo seriously. The refectories\nmake an annual loss of \u00a31,400,\nbut a move to raise prices was\nfought by Mr. Chandmal who\nconsidered this unjustified unless\nfurther facilities were provided.\nMeanwhile presumably the College must foot the bill.\nUnder A O.B. came perhaps\ndiscussion concerning Union fees;\nthese it appears will not be raised\ntill the College can provide added\nfacilities ; only the sports centre\nin the foreseeable future could\njustify this move. The secretary\nthen gave the report of the executive committee and mentioned\nthe Boat Club fiasco when\ndamage was done to Union property ; he suggested a motion imposing penalties on the authors\nof any further damage of this\nnature. He was rapidly taken up\non his wording of the motion by\nthe watchful Mr. Phillips who\nhad many things to say on the\nsubject (\" these Dinners are\nalways drunken occasions \"). The\nmain complaint by the executive\nwas that damage was frequently\npaid for by the clubs, and not\nthe individuals concerned; the\ntreasurer Dr. Weale then tactfully\nintervened as he was wont to do\non several occasions, and the\nmotion \" that members of the\nclub will pay for the damage\ncaused, and then may not be allowed to hold the dinner the following year at the discretion of\nthe executive,\" was passed. Also\nmentioned was a proposed film of\nlife at I.C. costing approximately\n\u00a3300 to produce\u2014'the President\nhurriedly explained that it was\nintended to raise this money from\n\" old student bodies and other\nsources.\"\nFor the R.C. C. Mr. Had in\nmade the plea that the whole\nquestion of storage space in the\nUnion be looked into ; upon Mr.\nChandmal promising that it\nwould. Mr. Phillips made the\nfirst of several complaints about\nthe use of his gymnasium as a general dump. Mr. Pearson de-dive red the S. C.C. report with a well-practised and efficient committee manner; at time pompous\nbut always accurate and concise :\nScrutiny, C. N.D. and their formation of a\" Christian sub-group,\"\nS. C.C. tours for students to overseas conventions, all well covered\ndespite interruptions. After considerable discussion into the\nwhereabouts of money for tours\nit was decided unanimously that a prospective visit abroad must be\nsupported by the tours sub-committee, but may obtain financial support from its respective\nclub committee. This is undoubtedly a good thing since\nstudents representing the College\nshould have its support whether\nthe most interesting single item\nof the evening ; a request through\nMr. Morden, by some students at\nthe Royal College of Art for permission to use our athletic fac ili ties, i.e., gym and changing\nrooms. Mr. Gardiner correctly\npointed out that conditions are\ninadequate for our own students,\nlet alone those of the R.C.A. However, neither they, nor\nR.C.M. have anything like the\nsocial or athletic facilities which\nwe have, and they would benefit\nsubstantially by being allowed\ntheir use. Since we already draw\non several of their facilities (e.g. art director Phoenix) it seems\nhard to refuse. Informal cooperation between members of\nthe three Colleges was enc our aged, especially over things such\nas Carnivals, Concerts and Social\noccasions ; a portent perhaps for\na future University of South Kensington.\nFinally, Mr. Phillips, speaking\nforcefully and heatedly, proposed\nthat the Union pay \u00a320 towards\nthe loss of coats (stolen outside\nthe Union lavatories) from two\nDutch students then swimming\nagainst the College. Messrs.\nChandmal and Preece opposed\nthe idea claiming that the Union\ncould not be held responsible (as\nof course it cannot, according to\nnotices prominently displayed ;\nnor I think would anyone expect\nit to be). But undeterred Phillips\nfo ue ht back : the notice had been\npinched\u2014pees were provided, inviting the innocent Dutch to hang\ntheir coats\u2014the pegs have now\nbeen removed, a sure admission\nof guilt (said with fee'i hg)\" the\nsituation is deplorable \" . . . and\nwhen the vote was taken, the\nmotion was carried quite con-vinci n gly, and just as surprisingly.\nThus the meeting concluded, a fair amount accomplished, some\nstimulating discussion, some not\nso stimulating, but all were\na a reed that Council had not met\nso amicably for al on a time. Mav\nFelix ever be invited to future\nmeetings of Council.\nEXPLORATION WEEK AT IC\nFebruary 11th \u201416th is \" Exploration Week\" at Imperial\nCollege. The Exploration Society\nis holding an exhibition in the\nUpper Lounge of the Union to\npublicise the activities and\nachievements of the IC expeditions over the last three years.\nThe exhibition will be similar to\nthe highly successful one held\nthree years ago. It will be an opportunity for members of the College to see the sort of work that\nthe College expeditions have been\ndoing, and to see at first hand\nwhat has been achieved.\nThe Society's journal, \" Exploration Review \" will also be on\nsale that week, containing accounts of all last year's expeditions, and some guest articles on\ncertain topical aspects of exp lora tion.\nSo remember, February 11th \u2014\n16th is Exploration Week.\n\n"
