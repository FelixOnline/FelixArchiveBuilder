Folk who have avoided death by\nChicken Flu or CJD will be\nable to observe that the population\nof turkeys is beginning to return to its pre-Christmas level, and those\nfew feathered fowls still remaining\nwill be appreciating the resultant\nfall in their life-insurance premi-um s. Similarly, the population of IC\nis returning to its pre-Christmas\nlevel. Iam naturally disappointed\nto discover that there is still no\nturkey here. I sincerely hope everyone enjoyed the break; let's all be\nglad that it wasn't another frugal\nSherfield two-week er. Once again,\nsolemn New Year's resolutions will\nbe swapped earnestly in the dark\ndepths of Southside Bar. None will\nbe kept, least of all the ones about\n\"going to all lectures this year\", or\nany containing the words \"teetotal\"\nor \"drugs\". 1 am going to ignore any\ncorrespondence pointing out that\nthis includes more than one of my New Year's resolutions.\nThere are some things around Imperial Iam sure everyone has\nmissed. Students returning to Hall\nwill be glad of the simplicity of\ndrunken swipe-card entry, rather\nthan the significantly more complex\nmental computation required to operate a set of keys and a Yale\nlock. The intrepid Felix crew are relishing a return to cheap curries,\ncheap computers, an extremely\ncheap coll at or, and the all-per v ad ing smell of cheap litho ink. Three\nor four students might appreciate a return to second-order differential\nequations, and the rest will wish to re-affirm their love of Southside\nBar, and remind themselves that,\nyes, the beer really is that cheap.\nPersonally, 1 am looking forward to\na second term reminiscent of that\nin the first year; work, counselling,\npainful relationship trauma,\nimpending failure, missed lectures,\ntherapy by alcoholic oblivion. As Gary Glitter once prophesied: \"It's good to be back.\"\nHands up all the fresher s who have\nnot joined any Clubs or Societies\nyet. Too busy drinking, huh? Didn't that term fly by? You are going to\nlook quite silly next year when there is no hall bar to pop into. Plus\nyou will probably have decided that\nyou hate all the people with whom you are sharing the draught y flat in\nBrixton, especially if one of them is\nnow making a move on your sweet-heart.

    "content": "10 COLUMNS 16 January 1998\nmm mm-ll li:l ll ll lf ll' LASAGNA BOLOGNESE\nThis famous italian dish is an\nexcellent winter warmer and although it basically consists of\npre mixed splodge and s tod ge can\nlook really impressive - I often do it when I 've got friends round. The\npreparation is fairly complicated\nand takes a while so Sunday afternoons (aka the armpit of Alan's soul, or so I'm told) seems an\nideal moment to get down to it.\nThere are three stages: making\nthe bolognese sauce (which you\ncan use for any pasta), making a white sauce and the assemblage\n(or putting everything together).\nI 'll go through these separately.\nQuantities are for around 4 greedy\nbastards or 6 quiche eaters i.e. using 1 kg of lasagna.\nFor the bolognese, you will need:\nf500g finest beef mince\n*\u2022 125g smoked pork belly,\ncubed\n\u00ab\u2022 4 0 g chicken liver, finely\nchopped with a knife (gross) or in a blender\n(slightly less\ngross)\n1 onion, finely chopped \u00ab* 1 carrot, ditto\n1 celery stick, re-ditto\n3 cloves of garlic, crushed\n*\u2022 1 can plum tomatoes\n\u00ab\u2022 A squirt of tomato puree\n\u00ab\" Vast amounts of olive oil\n\u00bb\u2022 Salt, pepper, mixed herbs\nThere is no secret to making really\ngood bolognese: everything must\nbe fried in lots of oil until dark\nbrown. Do the vegetables first,\none by one as they take different\ntimes to cook. Remember to get\nthe oil smoking hot before putting\nthe vegetable in and to fry the\npepper at some point. Drain as\nmuch oil off as possible and combine all the fried stuff with the\ntomatoes (roughly chopped) and\nconcentrate in a nice heavy pan\nover a moderate heat.\nNext fry the pork until most of\nits fat is rendered (melted) and\nadd it to the sauce. Finally do the\nmince. When it is brown (not grey)\nand just starting to stick to the\npan, add the liver, stir gently for a few minutes until it have set.\nTransfer everything into the sauce\npan, vigorously reheat the frying\npan and then chuck in a glass of\nwater (or better, white wine) to\nde glaze the pan. This involves\nleaving the liquid to boil for a minute, scraping off all the stuff\nthat has stuck to the pan and then\npouring the mixture into the\nsauce. Wicked flavours!\nLeave to simmer for about an\nhour until the sauce is fairly dry.\nWhite sauce:\nThis is standard. Slowly melt a heaped tablespoon of butter in a large pan. Then add the same volume of flour and a pinch of nut-meg and fry gently until the flour\nstarts to colour. Now take the pan\noff the heat, add a wee ny dribble\nof milk (say about at bl) and stir\nthoroughly until the mixture is\nhomogeneous again. Repeat lots\nof times until the mixture has the\nconsistency of say golden syrup or\nwarm con quail lotte. At this point\nyou should be able to add the rest\nof the milk (make 4 pints, if you\nhave any left over it keeps very\nwell in the fridge) without too\nmany lumps rearing their ugly\nheads. Now gently bring the sauce\nto the boil, stirring often and si mmer for 3-4 minutes until it thick-ens. Salt fairly heavily as this is\nwhat the pasta will cook in.\nAssemblage:\nAt some point in the proceed-in gs, you should preheat your\noven to 190\u00b0C, gas mark 6. Take a large oven proof dish and butter it\nliberally.\n1) Pour on and spread out some of the bolognese sauce. 1 prefer\nnot to use too much per layer so\nthat I can make lots of layers but\nthat's just me.\n2) Pour a large ladle of white\nsauce on top of the meat.\n3) Arrange a layer of lasagna on\ntop of everything. Break up the\nsheets if you need to.\nRepeat l)3) until there is no more\nbolognese left. Pour a final layer of\nwhite sauce on top, sprinkle with\ngrated parmesan and bung in the\noven for an hour or so.\nThe key to getting this dish right is\nusing the correct amount of liquid\nso that the pasta is well cooked but doesn't float in a bath of sauce\nwhen you serve it. The quantities\nabove should be OK but the\nauthor accepts no responsibility\nfor disastrous results produced by\nothers. You'll just have to practice.\nAntoine\nEd's hot tip: Try putting generous\nchunks of m ozz er ella cheese on\ntop of the pasta each time you\nreach step 3 for an even tastier,\nfattier version.\nIll& ll ll l Rag Survey If some of you didn't notice, we've been gettin al icc le bit of stick recently, OK we made no excuse,\nso this is a plea for help, enthusiasm and new\nideas to give RAG a1000 volt kick-start in 1998.

    "content": "NEWS 16 January 1998\nStudent Dies ANDY SINHARAY\nTerm has begun with news that yet\nanother student has died. The\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies\nin the Chemistry Department, Dr.\nDavid Wi d dow son, said that the\nthird year was found dead in his\nActon flat on Monday5 th January.\nHis flat mates attempted to revive\nhim, but he was pronounced dead\non arrival in hospital. There are\nbelieved to be no suspicious circumstances and an inquest has yet\nto be held.\nThe deceased chemist represent-ed, according to Dr. Wi d dow son, a \"very different\" case to November's suicide (Felix 1102). \"He wasn't depressed or down and out at all,\"\nhe continued. \"The whole thing is\ntotal mystery... he seemed perfectly normal, though a bit worried\n[about exams]\", though he stressed\nthat the student appeared to be\nunder no more pressure than any\nof his peers. He added that his\nflat mates had been with him earlier\nthat day and found his behaviour to\nbe normal.\nDr. Margaret Good game, College\nTutor, said \"Chemistry is devastate d... we can't see any reason for it,\nI don't think anyone could have\nforeseen it... he was a bit of a worrier, probably on a first, but no\ndoubt of a two-one. We had no\nworries.\"\nAs regards the adequacy of\npastoral care, Dr. Good game added, \"Welfare provision is fairly\ngood. It's scattered, but that's it's strength, because it's diverse, and\nthe links are good.\" Dr. Wi d dow son also told Felix\nthat \"We worry like mad as to\nwhether we're doing enough\"\nthough he added it was difficult to\nstrike a balance between giving students freedom and imposing too\nintrusive a welfare system. He also\nadded that if the student involved\nhad difficulties they certainly\nseemed well-hidden from those\naround him. As regards the availability of welfare resources he said,\n\"We would have to publicise even\nmore the personal tutorial system.\nWe're not even sure if it's suicide.\"\nOne of IC's welfare advisors, student counsellor David Allman, did\nnot wish to comment on this particular case, though he told Felix\nthat students are welcome to discuss any problems with him. \"People are very welcome to come if any student would like to come and talk,\" he said. Mr. Allman can\nbe reached on x49430. Work begins this week on renovation of the area around the Royal\nAlbert Hall, opposite the Royal College of Music, writes David\nRoberts. The steps will be closed whilst the concrete layer which\ncovers the original gardens is ripped up, to access the three-storey\nbasement beneath. In place of the current cramped Victorian plant-rooms, a larger car park, delivery access points and offices will be\npacked into the underground area, to free the area from traffic.\nWhen finished, the original stonework, balustrade and monument\nwill be restored to their present locations. The Circle area will also\nbe renovated, and the famous acoustic 'mushrooms' will be\nremoved for the Hall's ceiling. Although currently six weeks behind\nschedule, the hall's chief executive still hopes that \"the development\nwill be completed by 2000, restoring the monument, gardens and\npublic facilities to their former glory\". Photo: Aliki\nNews in Brief... CCS SHOP A member of the Centre for\nComputing Services Shop staff\nhas been suspended in connection with \"stock irregularities\"\naccording to Professor Hy nds, head of CCS, who went on to add that \"the matter is now being\ninvestigated fully\".\nDavid Thompson, head of the\ninternal audit unit was, however,\nunable to put a value on the loss,\nas all stock records have now been removed by police officers\ninvestigating the alleged disappearance. However, whilst no\nofficial figure will be available until\na member of the CCS staff in con junction with the investigating\nofficers make a final valuation, it is\nrumoured that the cost of the\n\"irregularities\" may run into several thousands of pounds, and the\npolice are treating the matter very\nseriously.\nC&G STAFF LOSE WAY TO UNION? The continued poor showing of\nCity and Guilds Union officers at\nICU meetings has resulted in the\nC&. GU President, Vivake Bhalla,\nbeing asked to explain the actions\nof his Union. Although Mr Bhalla's personal absences from several\nrecent ICU Executive meetings\nwere unavoidable, the reasons for\nthe continuing poor turn-out from\nthe C&G Junior Treasurer at funding meetings and several C&G officers' absences from Union Council remain unexplained. Rob\nClark, Deputy President (Finance\nServices) described the C& GU as \"failing to represent the interests of their membership\". Mr. Bhalla told Felix that he had been\nabsent for the last two weeks \"for\npersonal reasons.\"\nOS C BASH The arrangements for\nInternational Night, one of the\nmost successful annual events in\nIC's social calendar, appear to be\ngoing according to plan. As on previous occasions, the event is\nto include a food fair and show in\nthe Great Hall in the Sherfield\nBuilding, followed by a disco finishing at around 3am. Chetan Tailor, chair of the\nOverseas Societies Committee( OSC) which is responsible for\norganising the event, told Felix\nthat while the event would be sure\nto pull the crowds. \"It's the\nbiggest IC event,\" he said.\nHowever, he also commented that the expense was the main\nproblem: This year's event had\ncost \u00a3 1 5 0 0 0 , more expensive\nthan previous years, with the food\nfair alone costing \u00a3 5 0 0 0 . \"It's a large part of the affair,\" he said.\nAlso contributing to the increased\ncost is the new stage, being built\nwith equipment on loan from\nDramSoc and St. Mary's. \"We had\nto build it [in earlier years] and it's a lot of hassle,\" said Samad Latif,\nOS C honorary secretary. Both he\nand Mr. Tailor appeared nonplussed at the comment that they\nwere tempting fate by holding the\nevent on Friday 13th February\n1998.\nSTUDENTS OVER THE LIMIT A new campaign to ker b student\ndrinking is due to be launched by\nthe National Union of Students\nand the Portman Group, a self-regulatory organisation funded by\nall the major UK brewers to\nencourage responsible drinking.\nThe report will stress the importance of sticking to the govern-ment's recommended safe drinking limits of 28 units for men and\n21 units for women each week.\nWhether the guidelines will apply\nto non NUS colleges such as IC\nhas not been made clear.\nFELIX ONLINE After a term of inactivity, Felix.net\nhas returned with a new layout.\nThe contents of Felix will on-line\nin full every Friday, with back\nissues up to three years ago. The\nsite is located at\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix. Adobe Acrobat Reader is required to\nview the pages, and it is available\non the site.\n\n"

    "content": "20\nFICTION BOOKS 16 January 1998\nTHE SILVER CASTLE\nClive James\n\" You can stand aloof from the\nsufferings of the world; you are\nfree to do so and it expresses\nyour nature; but perhaps that very\naloofness is the one suffering you\nmight have avoided.\" -Kafka.\nBorn on the pavements of\nBombay, Sanjay is an unusually beautiful child. His cute\nlook and soulful gaze gave him an\nadvantage over those begging for\nthe same food that was needed to\nsurvive. Begging is all part of having\nthe right look and Sanjay had that.\nAt the age of seven, he wanders\naway for a while and finds himself\nat what he believes to be a silver\ncastle. Unknown to him, he is on the set of a major Bollywood film.\nFinding himself in favour one day,\nhe is thrown off the set the next.\nHe is beaten by his father for straying but the memory of the silver\ncastle and the beautiful princess\nstays indelibly stamped in Sanjay's mind and both become an obsession from then on. The novel takes us through\nSanjay's life. He becomes both an\nadept beggar and once he is no longer seen as a small child, develops into a skilful thief, changing his\nallegiance to different gangs. Soon,\nhe graduates into a guide for TV\ncrews and then into the rent-boy\ntrade in which he gains the favour\nof one particular middle-aged man who buys him a cheap room. He also attends a special school run by\nvolunteers once a week. It is obvious that Sanjay is intelligent and he\npicks up English quite quickly\nalthough, comically, not quite\nunderstanding its irony in certain\nsituations. Throughout, Sanjay is\nobsessed with the film world and reads all the magazines and goes\nto the cinema as often as possible.\nSoon he finds himself catapulted\ninto its world and far from the lowly\npavement. However, in the end it\nall crumbles away and Sanjay finds\nhimself without the favours he had\npreviously relied on. Clive James\nhas proved himself a skilful writer\nwith this commentary on Bombay\nand the Indian film industry. He also shows his sensitivity as we find\nourselves caring about Sanjay and what happens to him because he\nhas only really been brought up in\nthe way of the street. It would be\neasy in a story like this to analyse\nSanjay's character in a detached\nway. It would be easy to attach his\ndownfall to his inherent amorality.\nIt would be easy to call this a trag-ic-comic story and throw Sanjay\ninto the long list of tragic heroes\nincluding Macbeth and Lea/ who had but one flaw that could not be\nreconciled. However, this is the\nvery aloofness James is encouraging us to avoid. Sanjay is real. He exists. You will no doubt see him\nand look into his ruined eyes, one\nday. Whether you recognise him is\nfor you to decide.\nDennis.\nPublisher: Picador\nPrice: \u00a3 5 : 9 9\nAvailable: Now. THE CUT\nDaniel Blythe\nT his is not an easy book. It is an extremely\nwell written, fast paced, well plotted book\nwith excellently drawn, deeply unsympathetic characters. It's written through the eyes of\nBel, a nice, well-educated middle-class girl,\nbrought up in a seaside town somewhere on the\nSouth Coast. She is also a sadistic, cruel bitch,\nwithout a spark of humanity, who believes herself to be above things such as kindness and tol-er ance. She is the proud owner of a small, slim\ndeadly weapon: a flick-knife. Bel's just finished\nher A levels, and now feels trapped in Suburbia.\nShe really wants to get out, but she's bored and can't be bothered to change things. To relieve\nher boredom, she goes to parties, to clubs, joy-riding, shoplifting, takes drugs and has sex in\nchurches. She also sleeps with someone for a hundred pounds.\nHer mother died when she was fifteen, and some of her attitude problems stem from that.\nBut she's uncompromising and doesn't attempt\nto justify her behaviour at all. She doesn't want\nyour pity, or post-Freudian psycho-analysis, she\njust does what she does because she wants to.\nNothing Bel ever does seems to be right for\nthe type of family she comes from. Due to her\nfather's wealth and status, no-one ever suspects\nher or her rather dubious friends, even when\nthey ram-raid a few shops, steal CDs and destroy thousands of pounds worth of goods.\nSuspicion always falls on the kids from the\nrough end of town, the Fallies. These people\nnaturally become their enemies, and they get\nThe Cut - not the sort of book to cheer\nyou self up with, really.\ninto lots of fights with them. One night, how ev er, things go horribly wrong, as someone is\nkilled by the stolen car they're driving. Bel's world spirals out of control and she finds that\nher so-called friends, including her boyfriend,\nwill betray her time and time again.\nI really liked this book. Bel is a nasty, completely believable character: I have a friend who is a bit like her in many ways, and I can see elements of her in myself as well. Of course, I'm not a knife-wielding psycho, totally devoid of all\nhuman feeling, but there are some things that\nshe does that I 've sometimes contemplated\ndoing. 1 was fairly bewildered by the title, The\nCut, but it apparently refers to the day when Bel\nwill stab someone with her flick-knife and kill\nthem. It's a state of mind, an assertion - as I said\nthis isn't an easy read.\nI recommend this book to anyone who grew\nup bored in a small town, to anyone who's ever\nreally wanted to kill the person they hate most\nand anyone who's ever thought that nice mid-dle-class girls couldn't possibly ever behave like\ncomplete yo bs. You are so wrong.\nIt's not really a book to give your granny\nthough.\nJulia H Publisher: Penguin\nPrice: about \u00a3 6 . 9 9\nAvailable: 5 February.\n\n"

    "content": "16 January 1998 COLUMNS\nWell, if I'm not very much mis-taken, this is 1998, so a very\nHappy New Year to you all.\nImperial loves you even if some\nof the departments have a funny\nway of showing it by giving you\nexams before the remnants of\nthe turkey have been completely\ncurried. So much water has\nflown under the bridge since we\nlat met and I hardly know where\nto begin. What better place than\nthe evils of drugs I would imagine that the disclosure of Jack\nStraw's name came as a surprise\nto virtually no one, but this can\nhave prevented few from taking\nat least a modicum of delight at\nhis misfortune. The issue of resignation in this case is a little bit\ntricky, though of course the waters would be distinctly less\nmuddied had this happened to\nthe last government. Along with\nthe Robin Cook farr ago, it serves\nto highlight some very worrying\ntraits that have developed within\nthe shiny edifice of New Labour.\nThe first is, naturally hypocrisy.\nWhen similar episodes took\nplace under the Conservatives,\ngood men were hounded out of\noffice on the pretext that the\nGovernment could not apply the\n\"Back to\nBasics\" doctrine to the\ncountry, with\nexemptions for its own\nmembers. Yet\nyoung Mr.\nBlair has\nmade ethics\nand Christian\nfamily values\na key feature\nof New\nLabour. The\nreason that\nsuch breathtaking hypocrisy has succeeded,\nso far, in saving so many skins,\nbrings us to arrogance. With\nsuch a large majority, dissent\ncan always be easily drowned\nout, but Labour have gone one\nstep further by attempting to\n(Dco on quash all opposing voices with\nWhips that make the Stasi look\nlike Girl Guides. Quite why Tony\nBlair is so afraid of any opp osi tion, even with an enormous\ncushion of\n179 MPs, is a mystery. All of\nthis coupled\nwith the irritatingly puritanical stance\nhe has adopted offers the\nConservatives\na real chance\nof landing\nblows on what\nshould now be\np aj.a relatively\neasy target.\nTime will tell.\nFinally, a word of congratulation\nto my dear friends in Security,\nKen Weir in particular. Those of\nyou with long memories may\nrecall the Friends of Palestine\nshindig held here a few years\nago. It did not run entirely to\nplan and they were banned from\nthe College. Surprisingly, they\nwere sc held u led to revisit\nImperial before Christmas until\nSecurity spotted the booking and\nstopped it in it's tracks. The\nmeeting was moved to North\nLondon and resulted in a very\nlarge number of arrests and the\nintervention of the riot police.\nRegular readers will know that I bow to no one in my admiration\nfor the Conference Office, an\norganisation run with milt ary precision. It therefore comes as\na great surprise that they accepted this booking with little regard\nfor what had gone before. I suppose that even the finest operations in the world have their off\ndays, and as the cock-up was\nspotted before Sherfield was\nrazed to the ground, no real\nharm was done. Rest assured,\nmy confidence in Conferencing is\ncompletely unchanged by this little mistake.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE Win2 Chun Kung Fu By Renowed Teacher\nSifu Andrew Sofos Street Self Defence of the Highest Authority Personal Safety and Protection Skills( That really work) Train Armed and Unarmed Close Quarter Combat Gauranteed Confidence Self Esteem and Fitness\nFREE LESSON AND DEMONSTRATION ON On Wednesday 21st January Union Building At1.30 pm Union Gym Just come along in a track suite For Further Information Telephone01818085232 or 0 8 5 0 2 0 0 6 4 8\nDO\nNew year98' Why not get your year off to the right start.\nBring this advert to the Centre and claim\nyour free swim*.\nAs a Student of Imperial College you are entitled to:* Free Membership of the Sports Centre. \u2022 Great low individual activity prices and Season passes.* A wide choice of Aero hi c& fitness classes. \u2022 Join any of the clubs that use the Centre including Squash, Sub aqua& Shooting.

From\nthe people who seemed to almost\ninvent the rave scene, setting the\nstandard from the beginning. For\nthose of you who know of\nDreamscape I need n't say (write)\nmuch, as you' ll know what to\nexpect. Shit-hot Dj's dropping massive tunes and value for\nmoney.\nFor those who don't it's safe to\nsay that Dreamscape have been\nputting on some of the very best\n'raves' over the past seven years.\nOn a truly massive scale, giving\nvalue for money, top quality production and of course the best Dj's&MC' s in the world. Where ten's of thousands of party people have\nhad the time of their lives.\nThese 3 CD's capture this spirit\nexcellently, using Dj's that have\nbeen tried and tested at\nDreamscape events, they're almost\nresidence.\nDisk 1.

You get\nthe idea of how things are going to\ncarry on: fat, fat bass-lines, crazy\na men breaks, jump-up D&B at it's best. With the lyrical wizardry of\nMCG Q another of my favourites\nand undoubtedly one of the best\nafter Conrad. You're set for a non\nstop ride on that D&B aeroplane.\nRounding things off is Jason\nKaye, one half of Top Buzz taking us\nback to the days when he, Mikey B& Patrick rocked the place on many\nmany occasions as the Top Buzz collective. All 15 tracks are classics\nand mixed together like only someone with JK's experience and skill\ncan. Some of the tracks featured\nare: Altern8 Infiltrate 202, Bizarre\nInc with Such A Feeling, Top Buzz Living In Darkness etc.\nWith all three of these CD's( if\nyou've been there before), you can\njust sit back close your eyes and\nyou're there. Standing in a throng\nof people, music crystal clear, the\nlights going crazy and an atmosphere of peace, love ' n' harmony.\nThese CDs brought back many a memory from great times gone by.\nEven if you've never been or even\nheard of Dreamscape before it is\nstill well worth checking, giving a comprehensive view of truly original underground dance music.

    "content": "i6 January 1997 MUSIC\nALBUMS TORTOISE + MOUSE ON MARS\n+ SALARYMAN\nCamden Electric Ballroom\nIn the world of post-rock,\nTortoise are kings. This is largely due to the fact that the\ngroup's driving force, John\nMcEntire, has been involved in pro-duc ing, engineering or playing with\nthe majority of the bands that fall\ninto this badly-defined genre. So\nany bill that features them at the\ntop is guaranteed to be bursting\nwith experiment a i ism,a rhythmic percussion and a dangerous tendency towards fifteen minute long\nimprovised sonic excursions.\nFortunately, Salaryman keep it\nshort and sweet. Dressed in identical white shirts with black ties, they\nlook like the reanimated corpses of\nKraftwerk after a makeover from\nGary Num an.No robotic keyboard\nplaying here though, as drum and\nbass beats are twisted and warped through a bewildering array of fuzz\neffects and tone phase rs. They\npound their battered old Rolands\nwith gusto, and make an interest-ing, if occasionally un listenable, din. Its only on their final song Humus that it all starts to make\nsense, where a guitar is stapled to\ndeath to produce a epic drone fest that could have come straight from\nMogwai's Young Team.\nMouse on Mars offer a whole\ndifferent set of reference points -in fact, every dance music style\nfrom the last two decades. Heavy\ndub is followed by electro, funk\nchases disco down drum and bass\nalleys, and the crowd go mad for it\nall. Particularly good are their hard\nhouse tracks, rousing anthems that\ndrag our hands into the air as the\nGerman duo take us to broad\nplateaus and tease us for a moment, before forcing us even\nhigher. When Tortoise have finally\nset up their huge amount of equip-ment, they treat us to a gentle\nwander through rolling soundscapes. Dyed is compressed into a( relatively) short ten minutes, and\nyet they still capture the full vitality\nof the track, especially in the 'bat-t ling xylophones' section. The band\nfrequently swap instruments, so at\ntimes two drum kits and a Moog battle for control before the power\nshifts to a slow, funky bass. This\nspirit of improvisation is the key to\nthe Tortoise sound; only hours of\neffort could ever produce a perform ance this effortless. As they\nplayed Night Air, a calm rapture\nspread from the stage to form a pool around us, and we were left\nbackstroking through it with glee as\nthe bass twisted and turned\nthrough the room. Most of us were\nstill swimming when we left.\nNorm\nMORRISEY\nBattersea Powerstation\nI have never seen so many Dr.\nMarten's boots. Never so many\nof same covered by turned-up\njeans. I have seen qui ffs before, but\nnone so large. And the daffodils...\nwell, it was fairly clear that it was\nthe right place. \"I used to be the\ndrummer in a band called The\nSmiths\"; Stephen Morrisey knows\nhow to play a crowd. He sang superbly\nthroughout; anc\nalthough his recent\ntrend of whipping himself with his microphone\nlead was a tad distract-ing, 1 doubt a single person took their eyes off\nhis for the whole performance. The music; well the open-er, Satan Rejected My Soul proved\nitself to be more than just at shirt\nfiller. The absence of classics such\nas Dagenham Dave and The Last of\nThe International Playboys was dis-appointing; almost every song was\nfrom his slow selling Maladjusted;\nbut no one was about to complain.\nIt took the final encore track to\nreally give the crowd what they\nwanted; and he came through in\nspades. Shoplifters of the World,\nUnite was triumphant, triggering\nthe most entertaining stage diving I have ever witnessed. Grown men\nleaping onto the boards as if possessed by demons, striving for just\na touch of their Messiah's hand;\nwith grace, a kiss. Two men got up\nsimultaneously, charging toward\nthe unflappable vocalist before\nbeing dragged aside by the few\nremaining roadie s and security\nstaff. The way was clear, and a lone\nthir thy something got up, and\nincredibly he had a full\nfifteen seconds of stage\ntime ahead of him. Hugs, kisses exchanged,\nhands raised to the\ncrowd in exultation, and\nthe fulfilled dream of\nmany; a few shared\nlines with Moz za and\nthen he was off, The\nMan Himself as close to laughing\nas I have ever seen. On and on\nblazed chorus after chorus, ever\nlouder, ever more glorious, and\nthen it was all over, the lights came\non but the magic stayed; the same\nsmiling faces, Shoplifters sung en\nmasse on the streets, and I wasn't the only one who floated home.\nThe qui ff is smaller these days, he\nhas one or two more lines on his\nsquare, square face, and even the\nnicest suit could not disguise a burgeoning stomach, but he has still\ngot it, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Viva Morrisey...\nMr. Trout\nSINGLES\nRadiohead - No Surprises\nThis is the third single from Felix's1997 album\nof the year, OK Computer. It is a beautifully delicate ballad nearly but not quite worthy of the\nessential choon this week.\nSpace - Avenging Angels\nWelcome back Space, unfortunately. Once again they have released a mediocre single that\nappeals at first due to its sheer novelty value\nbased on the 'quirk in ess' of the tune. However\non second listen you're soon convinced that\nyou've just had enough.\nThe High Llamas - Cold And Bouncy\nHow does one describe this? Is it possibly an\nattempt at lounge core easy listening?\nBackground music at best is probably the best\nguess.\nRialto - Untouchable\nThis is a very mature sounding song with soaring string accompaniments and you might say\nit's full of pretentious overtones. Starts off in a promising if brooding manner but then changes\nto a pretty cheesy chorus. Disappointing.\nBag - Blue Suburban Skies\nThis could easily be Blur a few years ago. What\nis it about the word suburban that brings up\nimages and sounds of the Beatles. Well the title\nof this track is true to its influences. Unoriginal\nand bland.\nThe Essential Choon Bernard Butler - Stay\nThe first thing that strikes you about this song is\nBernard's voice. I don't know what I was\nexpecting but it wasn't the angelic one that\nyou're greeted with. You could compare it to the\nrecent Verve material, which is fine praise,\nsplashed with a bit of Oasis's Champagne\nSupernova. He has wisely stayed clear of any\nSuede comparisons by writing in a totally different mood. Gravediggaz - The Night The earth Cried\nA lament to the days of the slave trade whose\nlyrics preach out over an equally sombre piano\nline.\nWireless - In Love With The Familiar\nYet another bland guitar y song attempted to be\nspiced up with a string arrangement in the back-ground. The CD cover has a nice picture of fish\nand chips with a side helping of mushy peas.\nOut of the three items on offer, this song would\nhave to be the peas. 'Nuff said.\nInsane Clown Posse - Halls Of Illusions\nMenacing hip hop with an irritatingly catchy\nchorus, the line 'This is all because of you' embedded in your head, which no amount of\neffort can remove.\nSkoot - Seems To Me\nA lively, bouncy indie pop song that is pleasant\non the ears but doesn't exactly capture any sort\nof vibe. What is happening this week, there\nseems to be a huge influx of bland indie tracks.\nCuckoo - Non Sequitur\nThis track is more grunge than indie, along the\nsame lines as the Fountains Of Wayne. It's a catchy tune although it isn't very memorable.\nJason\n\n"

    "content": "16 January 1998 ARTS 2 3\n*t f IMAGINATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWLEDGE INSIGNIFICANCE\nTerry Johnson\nCan you guess who it is yet?\nMy self-imposed holiday\ntask was to write a preview of DramSoc's production of this play. This was actually a lot harder than I'd antic ip at ed, since I 've not seen a performance, and so I 've no idea how it\nwill be staged. I 've heard that it's going to be dramatic and spectacular with a \"big effect\" at the end. Having read the play, I now know\nthat this is a tragic comedy about\nknowledge, Relativity, understanding and the poignancy of human\nrelationships.\nThere are four characters: the\nProfessor, the Actress, the\nBallplayer and the Senator. The\nActress is married to the Ballplayer,\nand it's their failing relationship\nthat is the tragedy of the play. The\ncharacters represent real figures, I won't tell you who they are, just\nthat it's set in America in 1953 at\nthe time of the anti-Communist\nterrors. The States were gripped by\nthe type of mass hysteria usually\nonly expressed by mourning nations.\nKnowledge is nothing without\nunderstanding. Knowledge is not\ntruth, it is merely agreement. You\ncannot understand by making definitions, only by turning over the\npossibilities. It's called thinking.\nThe Actress has just explained\nthe Professor's Specific Theory of\nRelativity to him, but she only\nknows the General Theory by heart.\nKnowledge, however, is far, far\nmore than mere parrot-like re pet i tion. She doesn't understand it.\nOne of the main themes of the play\nis the conflict between knowledge\nand understanding, each character\nrepresenting a different angle to\nthese supposedly complimentary\nideas. These concepts are usually\nassumed to go together hand in\nhand, but the play highlights how we often misinterpret one for the\nother in love, life and science.\nThe Actress loves her husband\nin a way he'll never understand. He wants to possess her, to own her.\nShe wants him as a counterbalance\nto her own feelings of confusion,\nto her own insecurity. He seems\nso secure, so right in what he is and\nknows: he's an all American boy, a gum-chewing, hard-hitting, World Series winning baseball player.\nHe's also stupid.\nYou remember my first orgasm?\nYep.\nAfterwards I lay in the dark,\nutterly exhausted, hoping you\nmight light me a cigarette, and\nwhat did I hear? Pop. That's all I hear now, pathetic little explosions,\nthat's all you give me.\nYou want a divorce?\nSo stupid that he works at his\nstupidity, building it up as a barrier\nbetween him and her, a barrier that\ncould eventually destroy one of\nthem or their marriage.\nTheir inability to grasp each\nother's ideas of knowledge and understanding only help to comp li cate their lives - a problem not\nfaced by the Senator. His assured\nconfidence in life, aided by his\nso lips is tic outlook that everyone\nonly exists in his mind, enables him\nto destroy without conscience both\nthe life and work of the Professor.\nAin't difficult once you've sold\nyou soul. My orders are to find his\nwork, take it and sit on it. Then I get a call and I hand it back or I shred the damn thing. I 've given a great deal of thought as to the\nimportance of these documents\nand I came to the conclusion that\nthe shape of Space/Time is of fuck-all importance to any of us. It's just\npaper, otherwise why would he\nthrow it all away?\nIt's this \"ignorance\" that scares\nthe Professor because it lacks true\nunderstanding.\nSmallness happens and alone-ness happens but the miracle is\nthat insignificance doesn't happen.\nThe stars tell us we can walk on the\ngrass, talk to anyone we meet,\ntouch these people, ask anything of\nthem; the stars won't think the\nworst of us. The stars won't even\nnotice.\nInsignificance. Don't be fooled\nby the title. This play will force you\nto think, to question your own knowledge. How much do you know? How much is received wis-dom? How much is genuine comprehension? How much can you explain? Everyone at Imperial\nCollege can benefit from this play.\nGo and see it. I can't wait to.D Julia H THERE' S NOT ENOUGH ART AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE( THERE' S SOME POETRY, THOUGH)25 YEARS IN PAINTING\nAlex Katz\nA lex Katz is an American artist\nof considerable skill. His work is heavily influenced by\nthe late Renaissance school, especially artists such as Tintoretto and Veronese. He is exhibiting for the\nfirst time in the UK. Unlike many of\nhis con tempo ries, such as Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol, Alex\nKatz has never been pigeonholed\ninto any particular category. He could never be classified as a Pop Artist. He is almost unique in his\ntreatment of his subjects. The only\nartist I can think of who seems to\nexpress the same love for his mod els is Anthony Green, a British\nartist, now living in Cambridgeshire.\nLike Green, Katz prefers to paint his\nfamily, mainly his wife and son.\nOne of his best known works is\n\"The Red Smile\", his wife laughing.\nAlthough not on display, this is a truely beautiful painting. But Alex\nKatz's work is beautiful. It's full of\nperfectly formed all-American boys\nand girls, but it's cool, in a terribly\nNew York sort of way. It's the\nsame cool as Count Basie, as Lou Reed and as Andy Warhol.\nThe Saatchi Gallery is itself\namazing. It's white. Stark white.\nThis really highlights the vivid\ncolours of Katz's work. According\nto him, his work is both abstract\nand figurative. I think that by this\nhe means that they express real\nthings in an unrealistic manner.\nWhen I spoke to him, he told me that his work is meant to be optical,\nby which I think he meant that his\npaintings were not to be analysed\ntoo deeply, that they were\ndesigned to appeal, rather than to\nbe intellectual is ed. The last Saatchi collection was the truely horrendous Sensation,\ndismembered cows, embalmed sharks and other works by British\n\"artists\". This time, however\nCharles Saatchi has spent his\nmoney wisely on one of the best\nartists in America today. Go and see this exhibition, it is stunning. El Julia H Red Coat by Alex Katz\nIt's HUGE "

    "content": "MORE LETTERS 16 January 1998\nwhose author is\nunknown. It's rather a question of balance.\nThe argument about\nentropy shows a deep misunderstanding of the very bases of ther-mo dynamics. The Earth is not a closed system.\nBut evolution is a matter of\nfact: for example, in the short peri-od since the invention of antibiotics, bacterias have become resistant to them on such a large scale\nthat it may soon become a real\npublic health problem. Biologists\nstudying these resistant bacterias\nare surprised by the number of\ntechniques they have developed.\nAll this, I recall, over less than fifty\nyears. This, as other observations,\nproves beyond doubt that evolution is currently at work in our\nworld. Now remains this other\nquestion, can we extrapolate such\nsmall mutations within a species to\nthe evolution from bacteria to man\nand bombardier beetle? This is a big leap. Considering the scale of\ntime involved and the similarities\nbetween species discovered by\nDarwin, evolutionists say, it makes\nperfect sense. No proof, I agree,\nbut it makes sense.\nThe extensive example of the\nbombardier beetle is completely\nflawed: the author tries to con struct it as an engineer, by putting\nthe pieces together in a certain\norder with the purpose of the final\nresult. This is precisely a creationist\nview. Evolution wouldn't work like\nthat: living beings are full of useless\nbits and bobs, and a small mutation\nmay make a huge difference by\nbringing some of these components to a new use. The order of\napparition of the different parts of\nthe bombardier beetle can't obviously be the one described, but it\ndoesn't have to be this order.\nThen from the theological point\nof view, God wouldn't let us prove\nthat He exists, even by dismantling\nbeetles.\nNow for the really bad thing in\nthis article. Some people also say\n\"there is little evidence that the gas\nchambers were actually used to kill\njews, therefore they did not\". This\ncomparison is a little bit harsh, but\nit makes two points: First, of course\nthere is little evidence for the gas\nchambers: the Jews there were\nkilled and burned all but a few, so\nyou'll get only a little evidence. It is\nthe same for those missing links,\nwhich you take as a proof of c re ation: in the evolution theory they\ndisappeared under evolution pre s sure, and it takes an awful lot of\nluck to leave a fossil behind. This\ndoesn't prove the theory, of course,\nbut it proves its consistency.\nSecond, any argument negating\nscientific (or historical) research is\ndangerous for the truth. I mean\nthat I prefer believing in evolution-ism, because there is a lot of\nresearch left to do( as the article\nshows), than in creationism which\ndenies the need for science to discover the truth. That's my scientific\nreligion, and it's not atheism.\nSimilarly 1 prefer believing that the\ngas chambers existed, because it\nmakes me vigilant about the future.\nWe can't hope to prove anything about the evolution theory\nwith only one single sample of evo-lu tion. Science needs to make\nexperiments, but we can't afford to\nwait the millions of years needed\nfor serious ones. That is the only\nreal argument for those who want\nthis field of knowledge to rely on\nfaith rather than science.\nFlorent de Dinechin,\nComputing.\nHEROS IN GREY Open letter to Southside Security\nI would like to thank them for\ntheir kindness towards me last\nterm. I know that it is traditional for\nFelix to be rude about them, but\nthey did far, far more than necessary on this occasion. After a rather\nalcoholic evening, I was waiting for\na night bus by the Albert Hall when\nI was approached by a strange\nman, and followed back to the\nPrince's Gardens Halls of\nResidence. The Security guards not\nonly phoned the police, they also\ntook me home, which since 1 live in\nFulham, is not in anybody's way.Iam extremely grateful to them,\nthey really reassured me,and never\nmade me feel like a waste of\ntime.Thanks guys.\nJulia Harries\nChemistry 2Dear Felix,\nTHE DRUGS DON'T WORK Dear Felix\nYour editorial \"Mind Your Own Business\" in the 1 7 December Felix\nputs forward views that cannot go\nunchallenged.\nAs Iam sure both you and your\nreaders are aware, the possession,\nuse or supply of illegal drugs such\nas cannabis, is an offence under the\nMisuse of Drugs Act 1971 and is\nalso an offence against College and\nHall regulations. Although the\npolice often deal with such cases\nby a \"caution\", this cannot be\nassumed as it will depend on circumstances and the penalties on conviction in a criminal court can\nbe severe. What you may not be\nfamiliar with is that the same Act\nalso makes it an offence for the\nCollege to permit anyone to use or\npossess illegal drugs on premises\nfor which it has responsibility or\ncontrol; the word \"permit\" includes\n\"turning a blind eye\" to drug mis-use. So the College takes a serious\nview of drug misuse on campus and all cases are taken to a Student\nResidence Tribunal as well as being\nreferred to the local police. In a few\ncases the police have prosecuted\nand severe penalties have in fact\nbeen imposed by Magistrate and\nCrown Courts.\nThere is much public discussion\nnowadays about de-criminal ising recreational use of cannabis.\nIrrespective of the rights and wrongs of that debate, within the\npresent law we have a clear legal\nduty not to permit or condone its\nuse on campus. My own conversations with students who have used\ncannabis, makes me believe that\nthere are effects on students (e.g. short term memory loss) of frequent cannabis use which could\nharm their academic work and doctors have told me that there are\nrisks (1 put it no higher as it\ndepends on the individual) of other\nharmful effects on health. It is also\nmuch debated whether frequent\ncannabis use brings risks of being\nintroduced to other much more\nharmful Class A drugs, mainly\nthrough contact with unscrupulous\nsuppliers. There are a lot of people\nin all big cities who make large\namounts of money from supplying\nillegal drugs and who care nothing\nfor the harm they cause their \"cus-to mers\" and who resort to violence\nto protect their trade.\nWith regard to some of the\nother points you made, Wardens\nare in a better position to respond\nthan 1 am but I can say that cleaners are not used as spies and it is a slur on them to refer to them in this\nway. As regards security guards\npatrolling corridors in Beit after\nrecent fire alarms, this was for a very good reason concerned with\nthe protection and safety of stu-dents.\nYours sincerely,\nDr Gareth Jones, College Tutor\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIRCUT \u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX INCLUDES: V CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\nSHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp massage.

    "content": "6 January 1998 FILM\nBRING ME THE HEAD OF MAVIS DAVIS\nStarring: Rik Mayall, Jane Horrocks -kit\nDirector: John Henderson\nT hose of you who found the\nhumour of Bottom concerned too often with bodily\nfunctions will be relieved to learn\nthat Marty Starr, Mayall' s character in Mavis Davis has far more to\ndo with his earlier creation, Alan\nB'st ard. While the scheming s of a Tory minister are no longer topi cal, the idea of a music producer\nmanufacturing a pop career are\nfar from fanciful. The singer in\nquestion is the eponymous Mavis, played by Jane Horrocks, but she is reluctant to acknowledge Marty Starr's help. His\nthankless task becomes more demanding when Mavis' popularity begins to flag. When we join\nMarty, he is down on his luck,\nstruggling to re vital is e his pro-te gee's fame, when he suddenly\nhits on the highly original notion\nthat her untimely death would raise her profile no end. The bulk\nof the film then centres on Marty' s abortive attempts to\norchestrate this fatality.\nNo attempt is made to dispel\nthe suspicion that this is a Mayall\nvehicle, and his facial contortions\nadorn every scene. Danny Aiello,\nhowever, shines as the sinister Mr Rathbone, who is convinced that\nMarty can make a success of his\nson's awful Britpop band. Jane\nHorrocks too is superb as the self-obsessed Mavis, never straying\ntoo far over the top. The music\nthroughout is excellent, and her\nsoulful anthems are no exception -perfectly capturing an artist striving for a more mature sound. There are one or two genuinely funny moments, notably Mavis' determination to continue her\nnational tour despite Marty' s best\nefforts, and the film's climax is\nsurprisingly neat. Mavis Davis is a moderately entertaining comedy, but only Mayall' s most devoted\nfans should be disappointed if it\npasses them by. Q Simon Bradley\n. . OUT NOW.... OUT NOW OUT NOW OUT NOW.... OUT NOW.... OUT NOW.... OUT NOW STARSHIP TROOPERS THE JACKAL\nStarring: Casper van Dien, Dina Meyer Director: Paul Verhoeven\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier\nDirector: Michael Caton-jones\nW ith this effects-driven,\nmind exploding c re ation, Paul Verhoeven\nfinally turns 360 degrees through\nthe quality circle. Total Recall was\ngood; Rob o cop was mediocre; Basic Instinct was downright bad;\nShowgirls was laughably awful;\nand now Starship Troopers redefines the phrase \"so bad it's good\". The plot is intended as Vietnam\nin space - the (amazingly con v inc ing) computer-generated bugs representing the Viet Cong, perfectly\nsuited to their home terrain, fighting the pretty boys and girls who enlist straight out of College.\nHowever, it's also a vision of a fascist future, where only \"citizens\"\nhave the right to vote - and the\nright to citizenship can only be one\nthrough military service. The fun\nbegins as the doomed bat all ions take on the killer creepy-crawlies in\ngore-soaked CGI battle scenes. As\nthe bugs rip the soldiers to pieces,\nyou can almost hear Beavis and\nButthead sitting in the directors\nchair, yelling out ideas \"Yeh yeh,\nmonster rips guys legs off. Hey\ncool. Bug impales grunt on leg.\nHeh heh\". Or something. Q David\nHaving been disowned by\nFredrick Forsyth before a shot had been taken,\nhopes don't ride high for the remake of the 1973 nail-biter, The\nDay of the Jackal, and the film lives\nup to these expectations, ditching\nthe originals be liev ability in favour\nof all-out action and some really\nbig guns.\nBruce Willis is the Jackal, an\nas s as in and master of disguise,\nfeared around the world. Sidney\nPoitier is the FBI agent sent to stop\nhim, and in a desperate attempt to\nfind anyone who can identify the\nJackal's true identity he turns to\nconvicted IRA terrorist Gere.\nThe chase then ensues, as\nWillis dons false wigs and beards\nby the score as (ya wp) he attempts\nto stay one step ahead of his pursuers . Yet the feeling still remains\nthat the squeaky-clean FBI operatives have released one terrorist\nsimply to catch another.\nAs a safe evening's entertain-ment, The Jackal still manages to\nhold it's own thanks to some well\norchestrated action; a surprising\nperformance from Willis, who, whilst not the icy cold killer the film\nreally needs, shows off his versatility; and that amazingly big gun. fl David\nI KNOW WHAT YOU DID, PICTURE PERFECT\nStarring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar\nDirector: Jim Gillepie\nStarring: Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Bacon, Jay Mohr Director: Glenn Gordon Caron\nTrying to cash in on the success of Scream, writer Kevin\nWilliamson falls flat with his\nlatest take on the horror genre.\nThe plot begins in standard\nhorror mould, as four teenagers\ndriving home from a party\naccidentally run over somebody in\nthe road and throw the body into\nthe nearby sea, Although they're\ncertain nobody witnessed their\ndeed, the next summer they start\nreceiving threats.\nScream was applauded for its\nknowing take on the horror genre\nbut / Know resorts to the type of\nscenes which the former spoofed\nso well, such as the female lead\nalone at night, trying to solve the\nmystery herself.\n/ Know just leaves us waiting to\nsee what May' s Scream 2 will\nbring.... Q It's a Jennifer Aniston movie what are you expecting here - Citizen Kane? What\nyou get is a perfectly competent\nromantic comedy, with Aniston,\nas an advertising exec trying to\nclimb the corporate ladder who has everything (good looks, nice\nhair) except a man.\nAs per romantic comedy rules,\nshe finds herself torn between\nnice, sensible Mohr, and the evil\nDick Dastardly...sorry... and Bacon,\nwho only starts to chase her when\nhe realises he has a rival. Will she\nchoose the right man? Of course\nshe will, and a good thing too, as\nMohr shows himself off with a fine\nperformance, whilst Bacon\nremains on autopilot. Indeed, it's competent performances all\nround, with Aniston falling easily\ninto a part not a million miles from\nRachel on Friends.\nTake your girlfriend. 'Nuff said.\na "

If all the work takes\nplace, as of next October ICU will\npossess one of the biggest and the\nnewest venues in London.

Marketing Manager.\nCREATIONISM, MY ARSE. Dear felix,\nthe sort of observation-de duc tion science Wes Hinsley uses in\nhis Alternative Science article is, in\nyour opinion, worthy of a double\npage spread. The obvious flaws in\nhis arguments could cover a double\nedition.\nApart from the downright lies\nabout \"scientific evidence favouring\nspecial creation by god\" Wes, with\nthe help of the equally barking Dr\nGish, create a stunningly absurd\n\"demand\" for a Creator by reference to the Bombardier Beetle.\nNot only does he display his palpable lack of understanding of how evolution is proposed to work (a slight drawback when trying to\nargue against something) but his\nown arguments in favour of creationism are so weak that if god existed he'd surely be squirming\nwith embarrassment right now. The\none doubt Wes raises in my mind is\nhow natural selection could have\npossibly produced him.\n1 have no objection at all to different points of view, but Ido massively object to you printing an article this weak, which has no coherent argument and spreads disinformation and misunderstanding, surely Imperial isn't the place to be\npandering to this sort of reactionary bullshit?\nyours astonishingly pissed-offed ly, Anon biochemist.\nPS. Oops! I forgot to point out\nall those flaws! I was having such a good go at Wes that it slipped my\nmind completely, oh well, lets\nwade through the bullshit and point\nout the smelliest bits:\n\"Not one theory about evolution has been scientifically proven.\"\n-You was call y w abb it Wes, even\nyou know that scientific theories\ndon't prove things, merely reflect\nbest what evidence is available,\nevolution does this, so of course it\nisn't proof.\n\"The spontaneous generation\nof a living organism is impossible.\"\n- Oh really Wes? any evidence for\nthat? Didnt think so. no matter, you just go ahead and state it anyway.\n\"An amoeba in some 'primeval\nsoup'.\" Not true Wes, amoebas\ncame much later, never mind, we'll\nlet you have that one.\n\" Amoeba... became a man, woman, cactus etc while simultaneously remaining an amoeba all\nthat time.\" Wes, that would be\ntricky indeed, but as you know, it is\nproposed that we have common ancestors with all other living\norganisms, not that we necessarily evolve from them.\n\"This...flies in the face of...the\nlaw of entropy.\" Wes, thats bol-locks! living organisms rely, ultimately, on the sun as a source of\nenergy, the system is not closed.\nAt this point, Wes starts crapping\nabout lots of things; I 've got work\nto do, I'm sorry. I hate to leave at\nthis point, but I hope I 've made the\npoint. Please dont let Wes Hinsley\nanywhere near us again.\nDear Felix,\nI strongly protest against you\nprinting fundamentalist creationism masking as 'a scientific alternative to evolution'. It's always the\nsame stra gey: get some quotes\nabout the (real) gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary history\nof life on Earth, put in a few quotes\nfrom some physicists and material\nscientists (who usually have very\nlittle understanding of the issue)\nand then offer god as the solution\nto the problem. Mainstream churches are very happy to accept\nan evolutionary interpretation of\nlife and creationism is just a throwback to a pre scientific dark age and\nhas no explanatory value what so ever.\nDon't let Felix become a vehicle\nfor weirdos to propagate their anti-scientific medieval pseudo arguments!!! Best wishes,\nDr. Robert O.J. Weinzierl\nDear Felix,\nI'm sure you already got truckloads of letters about this article on\ncreationism. Here's mine. I react as\na scientist, not as a christian or an\natheist: I will never know whether\nGod created the world or not,\nbecause if He did. He could create\nas well all sorts of evidences and\ncounter-evidences to prove this or\nthat. He could even create the\nworld by evolution (I don't deny\nthat the present state of nature is a miracle). However, what I know is\nthat there is really few science in\nthis article despite the way it's writ-ten, so few it is worrying, coming from Imperial College.\nLet's begin with the main a rgu ment: there is little evidence to\nshow that we evolved, therefore\nwe probably did not. This is an\ninsult to basic logic and I won't comment. One could say that the\nevidence for the creationist theory\nis very small as well: one book,\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE 16 January 1998\nRENAI ANCE\nCivilization declined after the fall of the Roman Empire. Little of substance was contributed to\nthe spheres of science, philosophy or art for over a millennium. Then, shining out from the Dark\nAges, came the Renaissance. Julia Harries enlightens us further...\nThe Renaissance was the beginning\nof a new way of looking at the world,\nembracing politics, poetry, painting,\nsculpture, science, religion, architecture and music.\nThe heart of the Renaissance was Italy, and in particular Florence. At the time, Italy\nconsisted of many city states, each with\ntheir own government, and laws. The\nFlorentine rulers were republicans, the\nMedici family, wealthy bankers and generous patrons of the arts. Florence, even\nwithout it's art, is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The view of the\ncathedral must rank as one of the most\nfamous and best loved in the world. E.M. Forster even wrote a book about it.\nMary and Jesus, L.ippi Until the fifteenth century, Florentine Art\nhad been dominated by the heavily symbolic school of Flamboyant Gothic. These\nwere extremely beautiful paintings, with\nlimited subjects, and the personality of the\npainter was never expressed in the work.\nEverything was done to further the glory of\nGod. Artists such as Gentile da Fabriano\nproduced really beautiful pictures, all with\nthe same subject, always in the same style.\nThis was work of great charm, rich in in ven tion, and filled with sweetly seductive\nimages, dreamy harmony, and only a superficial use of form and space. There\nwas little true perspective - these were\nIconistic paintings. By breaking away from\nconventions, Renaissance artists were able\nto portray the Holy Family as people, with\nthe events from the Bible being set in the\nTuscan countryside. This painting of the\nMadonna, jesus and John by Raphael,\nshows Leonardo's influence, and depicts\nwhat would have been familiar landscape\nto everyone who saw it. This is a long way\nfrom the heavily stylised Gothic pictures.\nFra Filippo Lippi's portrait of Mary and Jesus shows the Renaissance development\nof perspective. The important thing about\nCJuomo, Florence\nthis picture is that the focus is not the Holy\nFamily, it is the cliff path leading to a church, with the distance is clearly represented by perspective. Art changed from\nsimple Iconistic Gothic painting to the\nrecreation of Nature in itself, with Man as\nthe centre point, not God. The myths of the Ancient Greeks and\nRomans were revised, and used by\npainters, especially Botticelli. This painting,\nperhaps his most famous, shows the birth\nof Venus at Cyprus. With her serene looks,\nand long flowing hair, she has come to\nsymbolise the renaissance, and in particular the Florentine style. Her face can be\nseen in many paintings including the Mona Lisa and countless Madonnas. "

    "content": "28 SPORT 16 January 1998\nNote For Your Diaries As from next week the Imperial\nCollege Rifle and Pistol Club will be\nholding a regular archery session\nevery monday evening from6.00 pm in the projectile hall at the\nsports centre. On hand will be\nColin Ledsome, a National Archery\nAssociation certified instructor. All\nlevels of experience will be catered\nfor, from total newcomers to\nexperts. This is a new venture for\nthe club so it is hoped that from\nthose who attend, a team can be\nformed to compete in the BUS A archery league.\nThose attending must be members of ICRPC. Membership is\n\u00a3 8 . 0 0 which covers the use of the\nlovely new archery equipment and\ntuition, not to mention the other\nfun and games the club gets up to.\nThose interested can e mail\nj. mccartney@ ic.a c.uk or\njd.thorne@ic.ac.uk to find out\neverything they wanted to know\nbut were afraid to ask.\nICRPC archers show that you need n't he e mbar assed by poor scores\nFootball I CFC II v Royal Vets Last term we lost to these Peak\nPractice rejects 5-3, largely due to\nhaving nine and-a half fit players\nand finishing the match with the\ngoalie Chris 'Scary Scouse' Barlow\nsent off. This time we were ready\nfor them. This time it would be different. The first half belonged to us.\nDespite the match kicking off\nbefore Si arrived and therefore\nleaving him sidelined for forty-five,\nthe desire in the IC Reds was evident and the Vets were on the run\nfrom the kick-off. Steve, back after\ninjury, finally shook off doubts\nabout his ability to 'get stuck in' as\nhe mixed it with the best of them while still keeping his distribution\nof the ball efficient and incisive.\nPistol Pete missed a sitter that\nMartin Keown would have buried\nbut this was only one chance among many as we peppered their\ngoal with shots despite having the\nwind against us. Their only real\nchance came from a free-kick given\nfor an alleged back-pass. This was\nably handled by Chris in goal at the\nexpense of his knacker s. At half\ntime we were one-up thanks to\nMartin 'Lineker' Archbold's fifth of\nthe season and the game had been\nall ours.\nDespite an impressive half,\nLaurent gave way for Si and new\nsigning 'Bertie' Basset came on for\nSteve. It was soon 1 -1 as Si gave\naway a free-kick just outside the\nbox and keeper Chris fell over at\nthe vital moment and saw the ball\nsail over his stricken form and into\nthe back of the net. Apart from that\nit was more or less one way traffic\nin IC's favour. Sterling performances from Andy Ferguson at\nright-back and Rob in the centre of\ndefence denied the horse-moles-ter s even the sniff of another\nchance, and from this platform we launched attack after attack.\nDebutant Bertie sealed the match\nwith a superb shot into the top corner with the outside of his left foot.\nGreat things are expected after a start like this.\nWith a few more results like\nthis, IC Seconds could achieve the\npromotion they richly deserve.\nICFC II 2 - 1 Royal Vets\nEditorial Hullo Everyone and a happy new\nyear. This is the first issue of Felix\nsince the previous sports editor\nSimon tragically departed the\nrealm of the living. For those who haven't heard the news already, it\nis my sad duty to tell you that\nover the holidays Simon was brutally stabbed to death during an\nargument in a Mexican bordello.\nThis means that I have found\nmyself manning the sports pages\nsingle handedly, a situation that\nst rec he s me to the very limit of\nmy meagre faculties and, sadly,\nbeyond.\nIf any he p cats or kittens out\nthere fancy stepping into the\nbreach and helping out with the\nediting, they have only turn up at\nthe Felix offices and make this\ndesire known.

Well, this appears to be\nwhat the boys at Ocean think and\nso we have Dynasty Warriors. But\nit's not another Tekken clone, oh no - there are weapons (ooh), it\nhas lush high-resolution graphics\n(a ah) and - wait for it - the characters are based on 2nd and 3rd century Chinese history (wah eyl). Seriously, this isn't really all that\nbad. The graphics are rather\nimpressive - both fighters are\nhighly fluid and detailed, animation\nis superb and the presentation as a whole is great. Dynasty Warriors'\ncontrols are ludicrously easy to\npick up, with two attack and two defend buttons. A quick waggle of\nthe joy pad and stabbing at buttons\nresults in a very slick set of moves\nfrom the on-screen fighters. For\nthose who like things really easy,\nspecial moves can be assigned to a single button so that even your Dad\ncan pick up the game and have a The one nod to advanced gameplay is the 'special move' bar.\nThis is increased by aggressive play\nand once fully charged, devastating\nspecial moves can be unleashed.\nThese moves are not only the most\nspectacular in the game, they\nshould hopefully leave your foe\nface-down on the floor. When you or your opponent are vanquished,\nrather than the de facto slow motion replay, a high octane instant replay shows the killing\nPERIPHERALS blow from four different angles in\nquick succession. Completely gratuitous and guaranteed to raise a smile from the average violence-addicted game player. Dynasty Warriors boasts all the\nbells and whistles that are\nexpected from a modern fighter -versus mode, endurance, team\nbattle, practice and a plethora of\noptions. And that's just about it -what you see is most definitely\nwhat you get. There's no real point\nin playing the game for hours on\nend, as there just aren't enough\ncombos and skills to be disco v ered. The promise of three hidden\ncharacters doesn't really extend\nthe longevity of the game.\nHowever, if you want a fast\nmoving, gorgeous beat-em-up that\nis face-melting ly easy to pick up\nand enjoy, this is for you. Is it\nworth spending forty quid on as\nwell as Tekken 2? No. Is it worth\nhiring for a night and getting pissed\nwhilst beating merry hell out of\nyour mates? Definitely. Did 1 laugh\nout loud when I first saw the action\nreplay? Oh yes.\nMark Baker\nPrice: \u00a3 4 5\nFormat: Playstation\nWhat is it?\nIt's the new Sony Playstation\nAnalog Controller.\nWhat does it do then?\nYou see those big knobs in the\nmiddle? Well, those are diddy\nlittle analog joysticks. So you\nhave a greater degree of con-tro l. What's the point of that?\nIf you're playing a3D platform\ngame, then you can move in\nany direction, rather than the\nJersey Devil\nOcean\nPlatform games have been a largely\nuntapped seam of gameplay on\nmodern 3D consoles - with the\nexception of Crash Bandicoot and\nMario - but Ocean are hoping to\nchange this with Jersey Devil.\nClaiming to have a non-linear\ndynamic 3D environment, it aims\nto be a true 3D platformer rather\nthan the restricted environments of\nPandemonium.\nA highly amusing and excellently animated opening movie sets\nthe scene, showing the evil Mad Professor aiming to take over\njersey with his army of mutant vegetables.( Sounds familiar? It will be,\nas they've nicked the plot from\nclassic cheesy B movie \"Attack of\nthe killer tomatoes\"). Only the\nenigmatic Jersey Devil can stand\nagainst him.\nThe game's non-linear levels\npredictably fail to arrive, with the\ndifferent levels available from the\ntown square in a strict order only.\nThis is exasperated by the need to\nwander around until an entrance is\nfound, adding only extra frustration\nand boredom to the game. This\ncould be excused, but for the next\nflaw; although Jersey Devil is\neight available using the normal\ndirection pad. It's also good for\nflight simulators.\nDoes it do anything else?\nIt's also a normal controller - a button on the front changes\nbetween analog and digital\nmodes. So you can use it with\nany game.\nWhat's the catch?\nGames have to be written to\nsupport it - you'll find an\n'Analog Controller' icon on the\nback of games that do. At the\nequipped with wings, and can float\ndown safely from heights, all too\noften the player is presented with\nlevels chock full of teeny wee ny platforms above a gaping abyss.\nFalling into one of these results in\nan immediate loss of life, much to\nthe annoyance of the poor game-player. This is platform tactics from\nthe Manic Miner school, and\nshouldn't be found in a modern\ngame - especially on the first level,\nwhen the player is still becoming\naccustomed to the irritating ca mera angles and unsubtle controls.\nStrong character design, a wonderfully haunting and atmospheric\nsoundtrack and the wacky cartoon-like world help to entice the player\ninto the game. Unfortunately, this\nis all wasted as the increasingly\nfrustrating gameplay and puzzles\nwhich have seemingly random solutions rob the player of all will to\ncarry on. Jersey Devil fails to live up\nto its promises and is ultimately an\nunsatisfying game.\nMark Baker\nPrice: \u00a3 4 5\nFormat: Playstation\nmoment there aren't that many\n(Jersey Devil, reviewed above,\nsupports it).\nIs it any good then?\nIt works very well - the controller is a bit bigger, so it fits in\nyour hand well. It does depend\non the game to some extent,\nthough.\nHow much does it cost?\nYou should find it for \u00a3 2 5 in\nmost shops. That's about \u00a3 1 0\nmore than the standard con-t roller. "

Some moves that were\nobviously pretty tricky, others that\nwere pretty plain and others that\njust went wrong.

They continue through a broad selection of\nnew and old with only one flaw, the\nfeeling that it was too much like just\nany gig, with the band at the front\nand decreasing grades of moshi ng out from the stage.

The cynic in me said that this\nstunt served its premeditated pur-pose very well, rejuvenating a slightly flagging concert and splitting attention sufficiently to the\natmosphere a bit closer to that of a club.\nLater still, after the completely\npredictable encore - why do they\nbother? - the D| returned and there\nseemed to be no forced rush to\nleave, a refreshing change.

Double Standards KENT YIP\nWidespread hostility among\nmedics continues to emerge after\nthe decision reached last term to\nsubmit a single entry to the\nBritish University Sports\nAssociation (as reported in Felix\n1102). The debate at Tuesday's Emergency General\nMeeting has forced\nthe Executive\nCommittee of\nImperial College\nUnion to re-open the\ndiscussion before\nCouncil next Monday.\nThe meeting,\nattended by more than\n300 people, was held\nafter Katie Armstrong,\npresident of 1C SM Union, withdrew her\ncall for a union-wide\nreferendum on the\nmatter. Her motion was supported by\nabout 8 0 0 union mem Hi lber s. However, the\nlegality of holding a referendum\nwithout first referring the matter\nback to ICU Council for consideration has been challenged.\nMoreover, if the referendum had\ntaken place, it would have clashed\nwith the annual Sabbatical Elections\nnext month. The possibility of the\nlatter being turned simply into a BUS A entry debate was thought to\nbe undesirable.\nResponding to calls for his res-ig nation, Charlie Joynt, Deputy President (Clubs and Societies),\ndenied having reneged on his election manifesto. He believed people\nBUS\\ ll lB ii a ff lr^ i had misunderstood his concept of\n'hybrid entry' advocated during his\nelection campaign. Under this\nscheme, smaller clubs would submit a single entry, whilst larger\nones remain separate in BUS A competitions. However, this could\nnot yet be implemented because\nBUS A was not prepared to apply\ndifferent entry rules to selected\nclubs. At present, BUS A is still considering changes to resolve similar\npredicaments faced by colleges\nincorporating the London medical\nschools. A decision will be\nannounced in February.\nAndy He eps, President of Imperial\nCollege Union, who forced the F. GM in the\nfirst place, was glad to\nhave the chance to discuss the issue again at\nthe next executive\nmeeting. He felt that\nmembers of the executive committee who cast their vote on the\nlast occasion did not\nhave enough time to\ntake in, and subsequently reflect, the\nwide ranging views\namong the population\nof the college.\nCommenting on calls\nfor Charlie )oy nt to resign, he said\nhis deputy had done an excellent\njob so far, and he had no reason to\nquestion his personal integrity; any\nmisunderstanding was due entirely\nto his inexperience in politics and\npresenting his ideas clearly.\nExtremists: Narrow Escape for IC ANDYSINHARAY\nAn extremist religious group\napparently booked conference\nspace at IC towards the end of\nlast term. The group, turned away\nfrom IC after Police intervention,\nwent on to stage the event in\nNorth London. One source\nclaimed several arrests were consequently made.\nIt appears that the group, who called themselves \"The London Turkish Islamic Association\", made\na booking only to have it later cancelled by Security, who had been\nadvised by Scotland Yard that the\nAssociation was believed to have\nbe a terrorist group.\nOne Conference Office source\nsaid that after the booking was\nmade, threatening messages had\nbeen faxed to them demanding to\nknow why IC was giving space to\n\"fascists\". \"We do get events under\nfictitious names,\" Felix was told.\n\"They tried several venues but\ncouldn't get in...we have to look\nout for suspicious groups.\" They\nsaid the Conference Office organises around 4 0 0 0 events each year,\nincluding those from mainstream\nMuslim groups, but annually\nreceives \"five or six\" attempts at\nbookings from extremist groups.\nThey usually have no fixed correspondence address or aPO Boxnumber, or may be vague on details of the event they wish to\norganise. \"We get fundraiser s here,\nand we can't be seen to be\nfundraising for terrorists.\" Felix was\nalso told the group finally took the\nevent to Stoke Newington.\nThe Union also received a fax\ndemanding to know why IC was\nplaying host to a group of fascists.\nMichelle Lewthwaite, ICU office\nmanager, said that the union was\ntelephoned from a man claiming to\nrepresent a different group who \"weren't happy about them [the\nLondon Turkish Islamic\nAssociation] using college... the\nguy went on and on.\" The caller\nthen confirmed his complaints in\nwriting by fax. \"I then called college\nsecurity who told me the event had\nbeen cancelled,\" Ms Lewthwaite\nadded. This has not been the first\nsuch occurrence: \"There was a group here two or three years ago,\nwho caused big aggro,\" explained\nRob Clark, ICU Deputy President.\nIC Security were unavailable for\ncomment.

    "content": "16 January 1998 FEATURE 13\nThe Birth of Venus, Botticelli\nWhat prompted these radical changes? The\nRenaissance was a time of sensitivity,\nhumane scepticism, and intellectual curios-it y. The old view of the world was chang-ing. Religion was no longer of such paramount importance. Michaelangelo was illegally dissecting dead bodies in an attempt\nto make his sculptures more life-like,\nLeonardo was carving lions in butter,\nColumbus was sailing to the New World,\nAmerigo Vespucci was naming parts of the\nGlobe, Humanism was conceived by Pico\ndella Mirandola and Machiavelli was scheming.\nThe Medici family returned to power and\ntheir sponsorship of art continued. The\nChurch gradually changed it's views, and\nthe world moved on. The Renaissance was\na period of great change and upheaval, and\nalso of violence and extreme worldliness.\nTo learn more about Florence and the\nRenaissance, I recommend \"The\nCivilisation of the Renaissance in Italy\" by\nBurckhardt, \"The Rise and Fall of the\nMedici Family\" by Hibbert and \"Renaissance Art\" by Russelli. Alternatively,\nthere's Mirandola, Machiavelli and Dante.\nOr you could simply go to Florence and fall\nin love, just as I did. The Catholic Church, however, would not\nbe undermined. Lorenzo de' Medici, died in\n1492, and in 1494, a religious fanatic,\nSavonarola, took power, exploiting the discontent of the populace and their fears for\nthe future. Most people were poorly educated and jealous of the wealth and influence of the ruling classes. Savonarola\nwanted a \"Back-to-Basics\" campaign: forget reason and humanism, hell-fire and\ndamnation awaited all those who did not\nfollow the Church's doctrines exactly.\nBooks, jewell ry and some of Botticelli's paintings were burnt on huge bonfires. But\nduring this period, Michelangelo, ever asce pti c, created one of his finest sculptures, the drunken Bacchus. Savonarola,\nhowever, didn't last long. He was burnt as\na heretic. As Machiavelli said, \" Nobody should start a revolution in a city in the\nbelief that later he can stop it at will or regulate it as he likes.\"\nMadonna, Lippi\nA REMR1\n\n"

    "content": "16\nCLUB SCENE THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE MUSIC 16 January 1998\nHello and welcome to a new year at IC and\nalso with the Electric Cafe. Hope you'll enjoy\nthe sounds that we'll be covering this year on\nClubscene.\nAfter the hectic rush of Christmas and\nNew Year parties, and all the crazy music\nassociated with them, I thought that I'd cover\nthe more chilled-out and eclectic styles of\nmusic that are emerging from London now a days. I was particular/ motivated to do this\nafter listening to a new compilation album\ncalled Atlas Earthed (Jumpin' and Pumpin').\nAtlas is an underground record store based in\nSoho (Archer Street) that has been dealing in\ncutting edge music for a couple of years.\nMany other stores in the area prefer to\nkeep to their music policy strictly. However\nAtlas' philosophy has always been to connect\npeople to great music that would not otherwise be given a chance in a world dominated\nby cat ago ries and cliques. Countless different\nstyles of music will be heard during a visit to\nAtlas. From dub reggae to latin soul; deep\nmelodic house to blunted hip-hop breaks.\nTechno is also well represented from Detroit\nto Chicago and London to Berlin. The emphasis here is on what sounds good, not what\nlooks cool!\nThe album itself contains eleven pieces of\nmusic that the staff of Atlas feel have really\ncaused a stir in recent times. In fact Earthed\nwas compiled by Pete Herbert, the manager\nof the shop and an accomplished D] in his\nown right (as we found out last year when he\nvisited the studios of IC Radio to record an\nElectric Cafe broadcast).\nMy personal highlights include Nod to\nH20 by Rainer. This is a moody downtempo\nnumber that blends the echoes of an acoustic\nguitar with a flowing synth. The effect is subtle and haunting. You can find the original on\nGlitterhouse Records. Don't Judge the Silence\nby Edge of Emotion points out that techno\nneed not be fixed completely on four to the\nfloor rhythms. Rolling drums and big beats all\nin one provide the structure to a very classy\ntrack.\nLatin eclecticism is well-represented here\nin the form of two tracks. Luna Swell by\nSimmonds is more complex and relaxing than\nmost of the latino house offerings of today.\nYet a simple turn of the volume knob in the\nloud direction turns it from easy-listening\npleasure into a very dance able piece of music.\nSccobs of Columbia by Plaid has been one of\nthe dancefloor hits of 1997. Salsa piano riffs\nand funky scratching; tum pets and big beats.\nWhat a combination!\nWe soon turn to reggae in the form of\nWork Hard by Charismatic. Chilled out listening and completely different from anything\nyou are likely to hear for a long time - this is\ndub reggae with a distinct electronic flavour.\nPete Herbert is represented by his own\nmusic, under the pseudonym Bushflange with\nNick Rapaccioli. The basis of their track\n(Chicken Feed) is a deep jazz riff. When the\ntrack finally kicks off it is a real treat! Layer\nupon layer of sound jostles to get to the centre of your attention. The result is a highly\nenjoyable track.\nThe type of music on this compilation can\nbe further investigated via a variety of\nsources. Well-established labels such as\nMo'Wax, Ninja Tunes, Talkin' Loud, Outcaste,\nand of course all the labels represent d on\nEarthed are all excellent starting points. And\nof course if you are ever stuck in the rain in\nSoho and feel like listening to some great and\nvaried music, you can always pop into Atlas\nto relax for a bit.\nWhile the world outside keeps on churning\nout new sub-cultures and styles of music that\nare supposedly better than the last, places\nlike Atlas are making the cement to hold the\nwhole thing together!\nMany thanks to Pete, John and Kirby at\nAtlas Records.\nal;ck\nCLUB SCENE CLUB REVIEW MOVEMENT\nAQUARIUM, 260 Old Street. (10pm4 am E10 members/NUS. \u00a3 1 5 . Smart Dress)\nT his is a club I 've heard a lot\nabout but never been to, so\nwhen the invite came to go down there 1 jumped at the chance.\nNow being run by Paul Nelson the\nman behind Raindance, probably\nthe biggest & best events of late\n80's earlier 90's, so he knows how to throw a party.\nThe night we went was29 th december not the most lively time\nin club land, and due to this only\nthe main room and the pool were\nopen, yes that's right there's a swimming pool &. Jacuzzi in the\nclub with changing rooms. Not that\nanybody was using them, not really\nthe weather 1 suppose. But 1 feel it\nwas good that the 2 nd room was\nclosed, as it created a better at mos and a little crowd In the main room. From the moment you walk in\nyou feel relaxed thanks to friendly\ndoor policy of no search at all, a pleasant change from the normal\nfull body search experienced at\nmost clubs. You just walk straight\nin.\nThe main room just oozes class\nplenty of mirrors and silver, a large\nbar that's quite pricey \u00a33 a bottle,\nabsolutely wicked lighting system,\nand an ample sound system, that's incidentally hung from the ceiling\nas are the decks cool. But not the\nbest thing for the DJ's as the decks\nkeep swinging back and forth,\nwhich was doing at least one Dj's head in that I was talking to.\nBut this did not seem to have\nany real affect on the quality of the\nmixing, as I hardly heard a bad mix\nall night from the four Dj's, Tony\nNickels, Paul Jackson, Nigel Clark\nand resident Huge Gunnal. As for\nthe styles of music being played, it\nstarted off in a cheese house style,\nbut as I was told it's not a strictly\nunderground club. But as the night\nwent on the music did get more\nunderground, fat garage b lines and\ndriven house beats soon took over,\nand in the 2nd room which is usually open playing 93/94\nhardcore/jungle, funk & old skool.\nAnd although their was only a small\ncrowd most of the people were\ndancing and there was a surprisingly friendly atmosphere.\nAt this point I must give a big\nshout out to Phil Mitchell of\nEastenders fame who I saw chilling\nat the bar, if it's good enough for\nhim it's good enough for me! This club has serious potential,\nonce everyone's got over the Yule\ntide period and clubs are to capacity this is well worth a visit. When this place is full you are guaranteed\na mad one especially when people\nstart jumping in the pool. I 'll definitely be returning to check the\nplace in full swing, and don't forget\nto take your Speedo's.HE/ o Public\n\n"

    "content": "16 January 1998\nNONFICTION FIRST LIGHT\nRichard Preston\nHale and his two-hundred inch telescope\nBOOKS\nFirst Light is the 'cult' 1987 book by Richard\nPreston, author of The Hot Zone. Now in a new edition, it is the story of the\nastronomers at the Hale Telescope at Palomar\nMountain, Southern California. The telescope\nwas built by George Hale in the 1930s and is the\nlargest working telescope on Earth, with a mirror\ntwo hundred inches in diameter. It is housed in\na massive dome, looking like \"Hollywood's idea\nof a Mayan temple.\" The astronomers here are\nsearching for light from the edge of the universe\nand their lives and work are described in meticulous detail. The book centres on the distinguished astronomer Professor James E. Gunn of\nPrinceton. Other important characters are the\nsenior night assistant Juan Carrasco, the\nAmerican astronomer Donald Schneider, the\nDutch astronomer Maarten Schmidt and Eugene\nand Carolyn Shoemaker, now famous for finding\nthe comet that bore their name. The book is full\nof fascinating facts, including certain names of\nasteroids and planets: Lucifer, Tolkein,\nMr.Spock, Swissair, Retsina (the Greek wine)\nand Transylvania. Preston wrote the book by\nobserving the astronomers first hand for the\nperiod of the story, \"like Jane Goodall among the\nchimpanzees.\" This has created a book more\nakin to a novel than a work of non-fiction; in the\nintroduction Preston admits that he did not\nintend for this to be a science book. However, a book about scientists is obviously going to have\na lot of science in it. This mixture of soap and\nscience does, in this case, work very well.\nAlthough not quite 'Eastenders' it shows that\nastronomers can be exciting. This approach is a subtle one but is effective in explaining the science involved and making the subject entertain-ing, although this was not the primary objective\nof the book. It is a very good introduction to the\nsubject to people with little knowledge on\nastronomy. It is still useful to experts from the\ninsights it gives into the lives of professional scientists and interesting to those who have no\ninterest in the actual science from the way in\nwhich it works as a straight novel. It is a readable and extremely accessible book.\nChiron\nPublisher: Corgi\nPrice: \u00a3 6 . 9 9\nAvaiable: now\nStudent Software Deals\n1 + 1 = 3 ?\nMathematica Student Edition v3.0W in95/ NT \u00a3109.00inc.

    "content": "18 MUSIC 16 January 1998\nCLUB SCENE ALBUM DJ VADIM\nUSSR Reconstruction (Ninja Tunes) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nT his awesome collection of\nbreaks ' n' beats has been put\ntogether by the pioneering\nRussian DJ, Vadim, capturing a truly\nmulti-cultural collection of remixes\nof his crazy dope stuff. It features\nremixes by artists from all four corner of the globe including Japan's DK Crush, Canada' s Kid Kola,\nEngland's Animals on Wheels and,\nof course, Vadim from Russia. This\nis a good reminder that England is\nnot the only country pushing the\nboundary's of electronic music.\nThis album has a definite down beat/ hip-hop feel to it but some\ntracks are more rap/hip-hop orientated such as The Herbaliser mix of\nConquest of the irrational, the\nJupiter Jam mix of Abstracts and\nthe powerful Theme From The\nConquest Of The Irrational remixed\nby the Prunes.The style goes all the\nway to other, more down-beat, no\nvocal tracks.\nThere is outstanding use of\nscratching throughout the journey,\nand some of the ways that the use\nof, what sounds like, live record\nmanipulation (scratch mixing at it's best) is truly great. Some of the\ntracks that stand out for this are\nKid Kola's mix of The Pimp Theme\n(nice use of bullfrog sounds!) and\nHerbaliser's mix of Conquest of the\nirrational. The variation in the use\nof sounds in the sample is diverse\nto say the least - some of the\nthings you can hear are whale call-sand bullfrogs as well as a whole\nhost of others. This journey is completed on a down-beat tempo, leaving you with a sublime feeling\nafter the CD has finished. Again,\nthis collection of bleeps 'n' beats is\ndesigned to be listened to, so sit\nback and enjoy the ride. EL cl Jo Public\nCLUB SCENE SINGLES m mim Freddy Fresh.\nDrum Lessons EP. (Eye Q)26 th Jan.\nCool drum patterns and stabs of\nguitar all roll together nicely, but\nit's a shame that he decided to put\nin the Hulk Hogan style Ho ooo! That spoils an other-wise wicked\ntrack, other tracks not as strong\nan OK little ep.\nSkylab.\nJudas EP. (Eye Q) Out Now.\nThis track is driven by electric guitars looped, stretched and fuck\nknows what else, over a breakbeat\nstyle drum pattern. That guitar\nstarts to work it's way deep into\nyour mind and, yes, this one's dark 'n' deep. Another quality production from Skylab.\n16B. Blackhole (Eye Q)19 th Jan.\nThis track is a smooth, top quality\nproduction and a pleasant journey\ninto the black hole, jigger ly drum\npattern, echoing spacey sounds &.\nstabs of trumpets, wicked tune.\nFreestylers. Feat Tenner Fly.\nB Boy Stance (Freshanova)\n26th Jan.\nThis as good as it gets, an\nabsolutely wicked tune, you'll be\nhearing this everywhere soon. It's bound to go top 10, with it's roots\ndefiantly deep in the underground,\nno sell-out business here just pure\nquality. This one's gonna put big-beat firmly in the public spot light.\nTuff beats, fat bad-arse bass-line,\nawesome scratching, wicked lyrics\nfrom the one &. only Tenner Fly.\nGet this while you still can as it's gonna sell out big time. You have\nbeen warned.\nRevolvo. Out Now\nWhite label. (No U Turn)\nThis is dark ' n' deep just the way I like it, squelch y bass tones, clean\ncrisp beats and eerie atmosphere-ical s. It just keeps building layer\nupon layer, then it's all stripped\nback to minimal beats cut back ' n' forth with more crisp beats and a beautiful vocal blends over the\natmosphere ical s. A must for those\nlooking for something different.\nGoldie. Out Now\nTemper Temper. (MetalHeadz)\nYou may have heard the\nGrooverider mix being played on\nthe radio, with Noel from Oasis on\nguitar &. Goldie on vocals, although\nit doesn't sound much like him.\nAnd I don't see why they used\nNoel on guitar, other than to make\nOasis fans buy it. It's sure to be a big seller.\nI prefer the Optical mix harder 'n' darker as it uses less of the vocal.\nOnly Goldie and crew could make\nthis sound so good. A Guy Called Gerald. (Juice Box)\nRadar Systems/The Fallen Prince\nof Heaven\n26th Jan.\nTwo dark d'n'b tracks give us a taste of Gerald's forthcoming album. Fallen Prince of heaven is a twisted up selection of breakbeat s, not to be listened to on your own! Radar Systems is a sneering,\nmocking piece; daring the listener\nto open their mind to the expanse\nof its creator. An EP so resolutely\nahead of its time comes along very\nrarely. Don't miss out, taste the\nfuture.\nBarabas &. 0D1. Deeper (Phoenix Uprising)\n19th Jan. 98.\nThis one boarders on hard banging\nhouse 'n' techno with its hard, fast\ndriven beats. The Jon The Dentist\nmix is more action-packed, using\nthat well-used sample from the\nTodd Terry tune, also used by Jay\nDee in Plastic Dreams - you know\nthe one. The A side is kept more\nminimal, with a more tr an cy feel.\nBoth sides will certainly take you\ndeeper.\nRandom 2. (Beggars Banquet)\nThe Gary Numan Remixes Pt 3\nThis remix series continues. Dave\nAngel gets things going with a typically funky, but unremarkable,\ninterpretation of Warriors. More a track for the already converted 1\nguess! The Liberator Djs are taking\nno prisoners with their mix of Are\n\"Friends\" Electric?, and proceed to\nrip the place apart with their hard\nbeats. Good stomping fun! Steve\nStoll has the last word. Remember\nI was Vapour reminds us of his\nminimal, abstract style.\nUnderground Resistance.\nThe Turning Point EP (UR)\n\" Mad\" Mike Banks serves up his\nvision of how the future will sound.\nSoul Circuits is a screeching piece\nof electro. Sharp bursts of an organ\ncollide with stabs of electronic\npain. Spirit Caller is dark techno,\nwhich manages to retain an organ-ic, tribal feel. This contrasts to\nHigh-Tech Funk, a minimal, bleep y electro tune that'll bounce around\nyour head. First Galactic Baptist\nChurch is my personal favourite.\nFinger lickin' southern deep fried\nfunk finds its way into outer space!\nRhythm Inc.\nTell The World. (Sweat)\nMid Jan. 98.\nThis has a couple of Dub mixes\nthat sort it out, fattening up the\nbeats, cutting down the lyric to\nonly a snippet of the original and\nechoing ' n' looping it. Making it a more full on track, those Dubby\nbeats save the day again.\nCandido. Dancin' &. Prancin'\n187 Lockdown dub (Catch)\nMid Jan.\nThis one-sided promo has hardly\nbeen off my decks since I received\nit, and has got a great reception\nwhen played out. Strong bass\ndrum sets the pace, building up\nwith the looped title sample. Then\ncomes the b line that you can't help but move to, top notice once\nagain from the from 187 crew\nJerome Isma-Ae.\nMellow Yellow Tracks EP.\n(Compose)\nMid Jan.\nThe sister label of Compost( Munich) releases this EP of relaxing vibes for chilled minds. Mellow\nYellow Pt. 2 is my personal\nfavourite. A catchy rhythm teams\nup with a punchy bass-line to lay\ndown the funk. The strings and\nflute keep the piece fresh and har-moni c. The flipside contains two\nmixes of the more harmonic, easy\nlistening flu bassoon. FTlCl\nJo Public &. al;ck\n\n"

    "content": "16 January 1998 NEWS 3\nBuilders Get Ghoulish Trainer\" Despicable Surprise rr\nANDREW OFOR1\nContractors were stunned to discover a severed human foot while\ncarrying out renovations in the\nMechanical Engineering building.\nJust before Christmas, a sealed sink\nin the Biomechanics unit was being\nconverted to a store for workshop\nequipment, when it was found to\ncontain the disembodied foot preserved in formal in. The police were called in to\nassess the situation, as regulation\ndictates, and subsequently the\ncoroner's office was informed.\nTony Why mark, the project\nmanager of the renovations\nremarked on his amazement at the\nfind and explained that the remains\nwere given the \"necessary respect\nhuman remains should be treated\nwith\". He speculated that jovial\nmedical students had planted this\nportion of a cadaver as a prank,\nexpecting it to be found in two or\nthree weeks, never envisaging its\nunearthing by unsuspecting contractors fifteen years later.\nOn the assumption its owner\nhas no further use for it, the foot\nhas now been safely and securely\ndisposed of by the college.\nANDREW OFORI\nStudent unions nationwide have\nexpressed resentment at the way\nin which the NUS has conducted\ntheir campaign against tuition\nfees.\nThere have been numerous demonstrations, such as the one\nheld in Hyde Park on 26 November\n(Felix 1100), which involved\n10,000 people, reflecting fierce\nstudent opposition.\nUnions felt that the campaign\nshould have been spearheaded by\nthe NUS, and are severely disappointed with their tardy and feeble\nactions. Opportunities to recruit\nfuture students to the campaign\nthrough schools have been missed.\nUnions have hit out at Douglas\nTrainer, the NUS President, accusing him of managing an ineffective,\nundemocratic campaign by allowing Labour alliances within the NUS to obstruct positive action. The\nNUS have been distinctly quiet at\nLabour conferences and David\nBlunkett even thanked them for\ntheir co-operation. Some student\nunions feel they have not fully benefited from their joining fees.\nLeeds Union have proposed a vote of no-confidence in Douglas\nTrainer, that could bring an abrupt\nend to his presidential term. He predicted that the motion will fail\ndue to an absence of backing, but\nQ MW proved him wrong by giving\ntheir full support. However, the\nvote is unlikely to take place due to\ntime restrictions. Helen Russell, of\nLeeds Union, stated the NUS had\n\"portrayed the wrong image\" of\nstudent feeling and accused members of betraying those they represent in order to pursue their political careers. Leeds union have not\nsurrendered and are still pressing\nthe NUS to take a harder line\nagainst fees.\nThe NUS accused unions of\nfailing to mount resistance to fees,\nwhose introduction is planned for\nSeptember this year. The old favourite, student apathy, has been\nselected as the root cause. These\nallegations were refuted by Matt\nHyde, the Q MW President, who placed the blame on Douglas\nTrainer. He defined the NUS as\nmore of a \"leisure complex\" than a political body describing some of\ntheir actions as \"despicable\".\nICU president Andy He eps viewed the NUS allegations as a transparent attempt to shift blame\nafter a weak campaign. Although\nhe agreed that current students\nwho will not be affected showed\nindifference, he suggested that the\ncampaign should have \"targeted\npeople starting University\". He\nwent on to say that one of the few\nadvantages of the fees would be\nthat they enabled students to com plain about the standard of education they are receiving on solid\ngrounds, but he asserted that \"edu-cation should be based on the ability to learn and not. the ability to\nearn\". He saw Labour's fees system as unfair, as entrants such as\nmedics could expect to be paying\nhigher fees due to longer courses.\nICU is not a member of the NUS and Mr. Heeps has no intention of\njoining. He gave his support to\nMatt Hyde, and ICU shares his\nposition of opposing the introduction of tuition fees.\nRCS in Drunken Art Attack JEREMY THOMSON\nThe 22 Club, the Royal College of\nScience elective social club, has\nbeen banned from all college\npremises for two years following\nincidents of vandalism at a recent dinner.\nThe all-male old-boys drinking\nclub met on 29 November to celebrate their seventy-fifth anniversary, and were allocated space in\nthe Main Dining Hall and the newly\nrefitted Ante Room Gallery, which\nwas hosting a modern art ex hi bi tion, 'Blanket'. During the evening,\none or more of the revellers\nentered the gallery and began to\nabuse the artworks, covering various pieces with wine, cigarette\nburns and vomit. An offensive note\nwas also found at the scene,\ndescribing the perpetrator's opinions of the sculpture.\nThe violation remained undiscovered throughout the evening,\nand the room was not cleaned that\nnight or the following evening. \"It\nwent swimming ly well... lively but\ncivil\", commented22 Club president Simon Baker. Unfortunately,\nthe gallery was due to receive a press visit on the morning of the 30\nNovember, and was discovered in\nits distressed state by the artists\nJason Pidd and Edwina Ashton,\nwho had come in the morning to\ncheck over the exhibits. They\nclosed the gallery to the press, and\ninformed College of its condition.\nThe situation was particularly\nsensitive, as the 'rolling art' program in the gallery is to form an\nessential part of a forthcoming\nNational Lottery bid to fund the\nnew music and arts centre in the\nlibrary extension. A large emergency meeting was called two days\nlater attended, amongst others, by\nthe Rector, the Pro-Rectors and the\nheads of departments.\nThe 22-Club committee were\napparently unaware of the situation\nuntil the president was informed of\nthe situation by Pro-Rector Igor\nAleksander last week. \"Regardless\nof one's personal opinions of the\nexhibition, it is a very regrettable\nincident. Steps are being taken to\nidentify the transgressor\", he commented. The cost of restoring the ex hi bi tion, which has now closed, is said\nto be around \u00a3 7 0 0 . It is not yet\nknown whether the 22-Club will\nhave to bear these or related costs.\n\n"

Whether\nyou're stuck in a damp flat in one\nof the rotting Victorian suburbs, or\na social prisoner in one of the\ndispiriting college halls, London simply does not offer the social\nand moral support of a community.\nYou only have to sit on a busy\nunderground carriage to experience this very real and deeply dam aging fragmentation; a hundred fellow Londoners, united by a com mon need to travel somewhere,\nbut isolated to such a degree that\nunsolicited eye contact is a minor\ncrime.\nFaced with this intimidating\nenvironment, students need support - they need it from their flat-mates, their work colleagues and\ntheir families, but most importantly\nfrom their college. Iam well aware\nthat IC has some excellent\nresources; the College Tutors, the\nCouncillor, the Chaplains and the\nHealth Centre can all help. But\nthese all suffer from a fundamental\nproblem - they require the students\nto go out an seek assistance them selves and, as they say, when you\nrealise that you've got a problem,\nyou're half way to solving it.\nWhat college needs is an effective and committed system to look\nafter its students. It is not acceptable to assign students work without helping them to deal with the\nstress caused. Sure, if a student\nattends all their lectures and tutor i als, then they are likely to cope\nwell. But what if they don't? Very\ncommonly, when problems de vel op, they easiest 'solution' is simply\nnot to turn up to college at all, at\nwhich point all the normal support\nsystems fail totally. I know this,\nbecause it happened to me. Stuck\nin a lonely flat out in Stockwell in\nmy second year with no hope of\ncatching up my course, I simply\nwasted time, not turning up for\nweeks on end.1 could have had a serious problem, I might have\nbecome seriously ill, 1 could have\nbeen broke and evicted or I might\nhave become a drug addict. For all\nmy department knew( and, it\nseemed, cared) 1 might even have\nbeen dead.\nAll it takes is to notice if a student is having problems, or has\ngone AWOL, and simply phone\nthem up, see how they are getting\non and find out if they need any\nhelp. Positive action must be taken\nto look after students, who are a vulnerable and unusual group. They\nare forced to deal with living inde-pendent ly, an enormous workload,\nsurviving on a pittance and dealing\nwith a traumatic stage of life all\nsimultaneously. Show them genuine interest and care into their\nwell-being and progress, and you\nwill have a happy successful group\ngrappling with some of life's biggest challenges, and winning.\nCarry on treating them as statistics on a league table and you\nwill have increased depression, a high drop-out rate, increased drug\nabuse and, as we are seeing, even\nsuicide.\nSmall Ads WANTED\nYou: Ambient sounds wonderland.\nMe: Acousticpoppyjazzthing with\na huge bag ful of mellow tunes.\nUs: Musical collaboration / experimentation and record company showcase awaiting.
