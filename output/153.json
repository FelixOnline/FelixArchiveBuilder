The emphasis this term has been placed on\nriding at V.'im bled on, and a party of\nabout six people ride there every Wednesday for instruction and hacking out\non the Common.\nAt the end of the Summer Vacation\nfour members of the Riding Club spent\na week riding and camping in Cheshire\nWe tried to keep the amount of camping gear to a minimum,but this extra\nweight carried by the horses did rest ric t the speed at which we could travel, and the distance which could be\ncovered each day before tiring the\nhorses. However, unlike last year\nwhen the baggage was carried separately by a pony trap, we could be sure\nof a tent over our heads when vie stopped for the night! One morning during the week we followed the Cheshire\nFoxhounds for some splendid cub-hunting. After the hunt we were invited in for \"drinks\" at a gentleman's house, and this was typical of the\nwonderful hospitality which we received from farmers and natives throughout\nthe week: indeed there can be few\nbetter ways of becoming completely removed from the screaming cacophony and\nbustle of a mechanical'age.\nSKATING The ICJ Skating Club meets every\nWe nes day at Queen's Ice Club just\nacross Hyde Park , end join with the\nclubs of other colleges in London Unive rsi ty.

They had two main aims.

A cup rehearsal was played\nagainst Kings last week and' in a very\neven -game, we managed a very creditable 3-0 win mainly due to a sound\ndefence. However, against Balliol College from Oxford a week later,\nwe had 70\u00a3 of the play, but somehow\nmanaged to lose 2-1 due in the. main-to some magnificent goal-keeping by\ntheir o apt a in. Yesterday, the 1st.* t. played a strong Enfield side, containing several county players, and\nafter a very hard fast match oh a rather bumpy pitch, lost by the only\ngoal of, the mato h this is probably\nour best performance this year.

At last we have had a Saturday\non Jwhioh all four teams played, and\nthe results were most encouraging.\nThe 2nd. XI won o on vino ingly by40 against Royal Naval College, the 3rd.

These results\naugur well for the season and for the\nclub itself, because it is in the lower\nteams that the true strength of any\nclub lies. A very enjoyable Sausage and Mash\nc upper was held last week in the Upper\nBefeotory at wh i oh some 35 members of\nthe o lub were present and judging from\nthe state of the o apt a in' s room the next\nmorning \"a good time was had by all* MAKE A NOTE OF THIS NUMBEHt\n7569234012769463756OI768 C4O IT MAX WIN TOU A VALUABLE PRIZE.\n.The standard English climate has\nbeen causing strife in the association\nthis session. Fixtures with St. Thomas' and K. C.H. have both unfortunately suffered cancellation arid the\ngroup who gathered at Hlghgate on the\n26th Oct. for the Autumn Meeting found\nthe bedraggled course deemed un play able. However, not to be deterred,\nwe fielded a fairly sound side on Wed.\n9th Nov. to tackle.the strong opposition of Kings and U.C. in-atri angul a i match at Stanmore.\nRemarkably, the sun was beaming\ndown benevolently as I.C. strode to the\ntee, but soon disappeared as one after another our stalwarts made their hazardous tour of the wooded countryside.\nGorse bushes were the order of the day,\nthough let it be stated that their rank\ns had been sadly depleted when finally we returned to the Clubhouse.\nThe result? Satisfactory! A sound thrashing was delivered to U.S., while we lost by a hair's breadth to Kings; - well nearly a hair's breadth.\nLast Wednesday we again closed\nranks on a formidable C.E.M. side in a first fixture at Highgate. Once\nagain the sun gave us the pleasure of its company, and with renewed vigour\nafter our previous weeks showing, we\nmade to sail forth into a somewhat gust\ny breeze from the opposing camp.\nYour correspondent gathers from\nthe reports that were forthcoming in the bar afterwards that certain of our\nside lost control of the Mains'le when\nstruggling on an awkward tack, and\ndrifted on to the rooks, while others\nmade the course with only the gi b sheet flying. However, despite some\nnarrow victories, the result emerged as\na three all draw, which gave ample incentive to all present to fortify the\ninner man, and it was as at lr fie dI.e. team that returned to college some\ntime later that evening.\n\n"

    "content": "II\nALL ON A SUMMER'S DAY To swimming shadows on water, the\nswinging sax of Jimmie Guiffre, dawns a summer1s day of jazz. The Newport Jazz\nFestival on Rhode Island. Ships and sails out in the roads; and faces, gone ext a tio faces, the sunlit laughing faces of the\nfans, the intent twisted faces of the jazz\nmen. At last here is the answer to that\nquestion which bugs all friends of jazz:\nWhat is Jazz? Well here is the answer,\nthe whole gamut of jazz emotion from A to\nZ, from what has come to be known as rock\n'n' roll to gongs and cellos, Konk and\nKahalia, Chico and Satch in the carefree\ncool context of an American summer's day.\nPictorially this thing is a dream,\no on tin u al close ups of the performers that\nreally helps the mood. The camera diving down on a close hauled ocean yacht to a drum-break. Candid \"takes\" of the audience\nthrowing their emotions; right in your eye.\nPieces of picture magic s \u2014 a duet of cello player and cigarette smoke, the orange of\nsunset, black gulls again sf the twilight\nblue of the sea,the flash of racing water,\nj iver3, drunks, a woman with eyes as blue\nas glass.\nUnexpected all the time, this takes\nyou in and out and round about the Newport\njazz so ene; on stage, back stage, out front, faces will take up the scene, tell you the\nstory of their owners and then flash you\ninto the middle of a funky solo. Starting\ngay, giving you the exp ct an cy of preparation\nsome real gems of local reaction to the\nannual invasion, then the cool, far out,\non the edge, leading to the great climatic of dre a* ay intoxicated identification with\njazz - the abstract. Then the cool off, the saturation, the surrender, the Lord's Prayer by Mahalia Jackson*!\n-crazy.\n\"Beat\"\nSATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING It is refreshing to see a film-about working class life aa it is today\nwithout it grinding,,3c me worn out. axe*\nWhat references there are ih this pip t* uro .to class struggle, the -Welfare state television, trade unions etc._ar_e incidental, convincing , and in perspective. The background (Nottingham),\nthe incident, and the speech are made\ntruly \u2022authentic working class. We o an but hope that it might pierce the defensive thick skin of those fashionable\nturnip heads who laugh in all the wrong-places and snigger when something parti cula rly outspoken is said, who even\nwhile lining the pockets of the social realist writers must have broken their\nhearts.\nThere has been need for a really accurate picture ever sino e \"Look Back\nin Anger\", started the fashion for \"working class end its attendant trappings of rather quaint vulgarity, T.V. trauma, noble savage and very earthy.\"\nOutsider type \"ang ries\" such as Colin\nWilson en han oed this picture of the\nbrute masses as a contrasting background\nto the Wilson brand of superman, who\nlike all super-men is modelled on his inventor. In this film Wilson's picture\nof an almost'inhuman \"other half\" rebelling against the established order to\nno great purpose.\n\"I want something better than mum\nan' dad got. Not that 'am blaming them\nthey hadn'ta chance, they've been snubbed by the bloody gaffers an' now the-y 're just dead from the neck up. Well\nnot this boy\". This seems more or less orthodox anti-hero of the fifties, but\nunlike the Amis, Braine, Osbourne types\nArthur is not an educational misfit\nbut jus i a plain/sx jr kih glad. although he engages in sniping at the\nenemy in true \"Lucky Jim\" tradition: he voted communist at the last election\nin his dad's name, it seems more for the laugh than anything else.\nArthur is a tough sensitive lathe\nhand \"knocking off a piece of married\nstuff \". Life hangs together between\nSaturday nights and as long as you dent\nlet the bar-star da grind you down, ever\u2014\ny things great. Then Brenda the married\npiece becomes pregnant and slowly end\nbeautifully the awareness of other\npeoples feelings and his responsibility\nte them emerges. The situations never\n'Hem pretentious, always o on vinci ng, especially a wonderful not in the. .\nleast, \"like the films\" love scene.\nI found this a cheering piece. It said to me that it is possible to\nhuman is e oneself against the enemy\nof machine cem form is m, and that beer and women palliatives are not the only things\nthat make life tolerable, but things\ndon't end on a milk and r03es happy end-ing.\n\"Do you want a new house ducks?\"\nsays Arthur.\n\"Yes with a bathroom and everything\".\n\"Iwo nld nt mind an old one - you know\nwe used to ro;ja all over these fields when we were kids .

Clifford Gore.\nSHADOWS A film without script or money, with\nsemi-professional actors, wh i oh. was\nthe or it i03o hoi ee at this years\nVenice film festival, thi3 is John\nCassavetes latest production. It is not\nan entertaining film, no film portraying\nlife ever is. Those who wish to be taken\nout of life and given some Hollywood\nfantasy should not see this film. The words and phrases have not been\ndeo oi.a ted to suit the public palate,\nindeed this film would choke some.\nThe dialogue is spontaneous.\nThe loosely knit sequence portrays\na period in the life of a coloured fam-ilyin New York. Two of the family are\naccepted as white. Le ii a Goldoni in the\nleading feminine role portrays with sensitive, realism of a girl disillusioned after a tempestuous love affair lasting one day.\nSHADOWS is of race relationships.\nalthough not produced as suo h.It must\nbe seen if only to see the technique\nwh i oh promises to'revolution is e the\nfading film industry.\nK.F.C. BOSSARD.\nBALLET AND OPERA by I.L. Gibson.\nStravinsky's vocal works are so\nseldom performed in this country that\nan op pur t unity of seeing two in one\ngo should.not be missed. \"Oedipus Rex\"\nand \"The Nightingale\" are being given\nas a double bill at Sadler's Wells,\none further performance being scheduled\nfor ii cve i a ber30th. Although Stravinsky is not every-one1 soup of tea, if one approaches the\n.evening with an unbiased mind and ear,\nI am sure these (wo works will. not fail to impress. \"The Nightingale\" is the earlier and slighter pie oe and in some ways may be considered rather\nnaive in comparison with the majesty\nand drama of \"Oedipus Rex\". Strictly this last is not an opera, but an\nopera\u2014oratorio, and is sung in Latin by a chorus and six soloists. A narrator eases the job of interpretation,\nbut he is not allowed to intrude into\nthe stage drama, the effect of which\n1B considerably heightened by the\nvery fine decor. The whole of the cast,\nincluding the chorus, appear in sym-boli c masks, while the splendid costumes\ngive the production a regal air. Stravinsky's music and this imaginative stage presentation combine to\ngive the performance as a whole tremendous impact, and as the tragedy draws\nto a close one is nearly overpowered by\nthe force of the music.\nThe Ballet Season opens at Covent\nGarden on December 14th. with\"Cinderella\".\nFohteyn and Soames will be flying from\nNew York to appear on this opening night,\nbut later in the season Beriosova,\nNerina, and Seymour will be appearing in the title role. \"Swan Lake^. returns to the repertory early in the New Year, Nerina\nappearing in Hie first performance\nin the dual role of Odette-Odile, on\nJanuary 11th. \"Coppelia\", \"Pineapple\nPoll\" and a new ballet, \"The Invitation\", are among the other works\nbeing performed during the Christmas\nSeason.\nThe Festival Ballet will be appearing at the Festival Hall, and here Tchaikovsky's \"The Nutcracker\" will be the\nmain offering. HOW TO GET FIT Extract from a letter by an Art College organiser of training, to a headmaster:-In the meantime, would it help\nif we sent the students for four\ndays per week for three days? This\nwould give ( if my calculations are\nright) five ordinal days twice\nrunning and two days once each as\nagainst three ordinal days twice run-ning, two twice but missing a turn, and two twice only.\n\n"

We suggest\nthat all the nearby buildings of\nimportance be adapted for College use.\nThe most immediate requirement\nis the Victoria and Albert Museum,\nw hio his already admirably furnished\nfor use as a Hostel. There are several\nlarge rooms suitable for parties, containing huge four-poster beds on which\nall those unable to find their way home\nmay be accommodated.\nThe Natural History Museum would\nprovide an unending series of stuffed\nma soot s to replace ours, whenever it( or\nhe) has been stolen by another College.\nWhat is more, Guildsmen would be able to\nfind congenial hostel accommodation in the Anthropoid section.\nNo longer need the Miners go down\nto Cornwall to do their digging.

I wanted to compare it with the previous issue,which, I was taught at school,should have been No.\n151,dated 28th. October 1960. But when I found Felix of that date,I found a celebratory issue numbered 150.\nWhat has happened to 151? This is< the Mystery of the Year - Nay,the Decade.\nThen a possible answer o cou red to\nme. Have you,sir,become like the painter\nwho,finding that he had little paint left worked faster so that he would finish before the paint ran out? But no.152was your first edition. Surely you're not\ndevoid of ideas so soon and ready to quit\nyour position?\nOr are you working backward to Christmas and printing No. 151 in a fortnight's time? Th l\" wouldn't be a bad idea because\non Dec.9th. the Christmas edition of Felix will be published,it would be No.150 and\nyou oo ul d have another celebratory issue.\nAnd what of 1961? Are we turning our\nDecks on the future? Will progress stop\nIn this college? I am sure it will not\nhappen,but this is a logical result of\ntko great'mystery.

However, now that\na fortnightly article has become nec ess ary to argue each case more fully though unfortunately this will mean\nthat fewer sub j edt s may be mentioned.\nMr. \"Fotheringham\" crit is ed my\ncomments of the last issue regarding the\nchoice of dates and the number of Union\nmeetings for this term. He said, for instance,\"...it is not possible to\ndecide the dates of Union meetings\nbefore the beginning of terra as these\nare arranged in conjunction with the\nGeneral Studies Board\". This is precisely my point - in reverse! In\nfact, the following happened. Last\njul f lp several societies started arranging\ntheir programme for this term. The more\nconscientious found out in advance that\nthe General Studies Progra>\u00bbse had\nprovision for Union Meetings in October\n25th and December 8th. This programme\nwas in fact published and distributed during the first week of term. It was\nthen decided not to hold the Union\nMeetings pn these two days but one\nmeeting on November 15th. The following\nare reasons for crit ising thi3 decision:-1). Several College society meet\nin gs had to be cancelled because of this\ndecision.\nBy John.Cox.\n2). The Agenda was certain to be\novercrowded.\n}). The first Union Meeting for the\nFreshers would include the dullest item\nof the year - the Accounts, thus possibly\nmaking them less likely to come again.\nif). Holding one meeting before\nDecember made it necessary to present\nthe Accounts before there had been enough\ntime to have the Accounts printed.\nIn the light of the above I feel my criticisms were justified. My very good friend Dave Wilbraham\nwas telling me the other day how much it annoys him to find the T.V. in the Union\nLounge. This happens every time there\nis a posh dinner in the evening. It seems\nto me that the moat sensible place for the T.V. set would be in the Small Lounge\nupstairs, I wonder what Mr \"Fotheringham\"\nthinks!\nOne last snippet, I see that up till now (nov.19th) neither the decisions nor\nthe minutes of Council meetings have been\nposted on the Council notice-board this\nterm. Since Council have been instructed\nby-two Union meetings to use this means\nof publishing their decisions, it does\nseem a little high-handed for the Union\nmeeting's decision to be ignored like this. COUNTER COMMENT by U. T.L. Fotheringham,\nI am gratified to see that Mr. Cox.\nis now going to present arguments on\nthe topics he raises; this is infinitely preferable to baldly stating one side\nof a controversial question.\nMy information regarding the dates\nof Union Meetings was obtained from\nthe President of the Union. In fact\nthe date of the Union, fci ee ting was not\ndecided until the beginning of this term, presumably Mr. Hill thought that\nOctober 25th was too early in the term.\nfor Freshers to be \"able to decide on a. matter so important aa a change in Union\nConstitution. It does, however, seem\nillogical to present the Accounts before\nprinted copies were available; the\nw res her s were not alone in their bore aom.

In those three years\nmy opinions of the aims of university\neducation, especially as applied here,\nhave changed fundamentally. In those\nearly days the magic letters B. Sc. rep--resented the ideal of my efforts, t ney influenced me wherever I went-, what--ever I did.\nNow I am the \"proud\" possessor of\nthe degree of B.3c.( Special) and nave\noom e to realise the full meaning of the\nqualification \"special\". It means end--les3 toil, worry, and above all, long\nhours. It means the accumulation of\nreams upon reams of fact3, many of wh i oh are useless, many more of wh i oh are for--gotten on oe the relative examinations\nare taken. In short it means nothing less\nthan or aram lng. It should not be necessary that students should have to work\nregularly until 9pm. to finish a day3 set work.\nOver the last two years the Science\nand Education Committee of the Science\nMasters Association and the Association\nof Women Science Teachers has been o on side ring the syllabuses of sixth form\ncourses. In the case of ph ys ios it has\nbeen shown that, by the use of imaginative presentation, the time spent on\nthe o our se by the pupil could be reduced\nby 2X&v Here then is a case Cor radical\nchanges at Imperial College.\nSince the end of the last war we\nhave seen great advances in teaching\nmethods at primary soho ol s. Now secondary education is changing. We can\nsee a minor revolution taking place but\nat present we.are prepared to stand back\nand watch. Is this good enough? The\nanswer is definitely NO. In a world\nwhere the status of the so i ent is tis rapidly rising it becomes more and more\nImportant for the science graduate to be\nequipped with a good education as well\nas a good degree. At present many pe o ple leave I.C, with one or the other;\nbut rarely both.' Do you think that\nthis should be so ? If not then where\ndoes the fault lay ? What can be done?\nTou should all have some views on this,\nafter all your future depends on it. If\nyour feeling are strong then take up\nyour pen and write, if you oo ul dn' to are less then Ioan only condemn you for\nyour apathy.\n' Robert P. Chetney.\nDear Reader,\nBy now most of po u will know that\nI am an avowed Conservative. However\nI am forced to d is a gg ree with a fei ip w Conservative, namely Finlay D. Mcpherson. Prom his,latter in the last\nedition of FELIX I get the impression\nthat he is being haunted by nightmares\nof the Union being taken over by soc--i a lists on a popular vote. If what he\nsays i3 true he may well be justified- in\nhaving such nightmares.\nIt appears that I.C. contains a large majority of idealist io socialists\n(we poor Conservatives are the oppressed\nminority ??). These fan at ios will, un--less put down by those in authority,\ndestroy the whole organisation of the\nUnion, They lust after that terrible\nseditious thing, democracy. They now\nactually want to be able to vote for\ntheir President. However Finlay think a this reeks of that \"one man one vote\"\ndogma. Obviously it must be stamped .\nout at once.\nHow the truly nightmarish beings\nappear. It seems that I.C. is pop--u late d by people who are completely\nincapable of choosing their own President\nGiven a free choice they would, apparently, always choose the candidate with\nthe pretty face, the one that can down\nthe most beer or the \"popular hero\".\nThey would avoid all the \"profiles\"\nappearing round the College (possibly even in FELIX). They would not\nconsider what administrative and amb--as sado rial qualities the candidates had\nand they would certainly ignore whether\nhe was suitable or not. Steadfastly,\nto a man, they would vote. for the most\nunsuitable candidate. V Such a situation, if true,., is, absolutely nightmarish. The future of\nI.C. and indeed of the world would look\ngrim, if the intellectual cream of Brit-ain are not capable of doing what t fee whole population of America can do, ria me ly choosing their own president.\nHowever I, feel more optimist io about the\" situation. I think that the.\nthere are a few thinking beings still at'\nCollege who may be able to save us from\nthis catastrophe. In fact I think that\nthere are about 2,800 tii in king beings to\nsave ua from this. I feel that the\nstudents of this College, even given the\nheady wine of \"one man one vote\", wo uli? behave in a completely sane and 3ober manner. They l jou ld read about it, think\nabout it, talk' about it, and I am conf i dent they would choose the right person\nfor president.\nI will ignore the fact that Finlay\nthink a the president should be chosen\nonly by his personal friends, who, to\nFinlays way of thinking, \"know him1.' I will also ignore the fao t that Finlay\nConsiders a president by 28 people to be\nmore truly representative than one chosen\nby 2,800. Both these arguments are oo--vio us ly fallacious.\nIn conclusion I would disagree with\nFinlay on another point. The president\naccording to him, represents the \"Union\"\nat functions outside College. If we\nmay truthfully call the 28 members of\nCounoil the \"Union*then this is true.\nHowever, I personally feel that there a are 2,778 other students who also should\nsave some representation.\nD.3. Mercer.\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to Finlay MoPherson's art --i cle opposing the demo o ratio election\nof the I.G.. President X would like to\nmake the following points.\nIn the first place, o on tr ary to\nwhat Mr. Mcpherson would have us believe\nIf our President were elected a3o result\nof a poll,, and presumably hustings, by\nvirtue of having to prove himself before\na highly critical audience, any nu oh President would have to demonstrate his\no ap abilities for the job in a way that\nno I.C. President has yet even had to\nconsider.\nMy seo on d point is this;, in an age\nwhen students are learning more about\nless, and often abdicating reap on sibi l ty in favour of material se our it y, any added\nresp on sibi l ty is to be welcomed. To\npretend that I.C. students cannot show\na responsible attitude when given the\nopportunity is belied at the sober\napproach shown at the last Union Meeting\nwhen the Charity Carnival was discussed.\nFinally, to el eot our President dem--ocr a tic ally would not force him off his\n'pedestal'. Rather his popular mandate\nwould be increased and he would enjoy a far greater freedom to a ot on our behalf\nthan he does now.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid Finney.\nDear Sir,\nI should like to reply to the\ntwo letters you have received regarding\nthe election of the president. Mr.\nFinney s& ys that the Presidential\ncandidates would become known to the\nstudents by appearing at -hustings.\nThis would briefly introduce him to\nabout J4OO people, but the other\n2,400 who could not bother to attend\na Union Meeting would still be able\nto vote under the proposed polling\nsystem.\nAgain, Mr. Finney points to the\nresponsible discussion which took place\nat the last Union Meeting over the I.C. Carnival. At this discussion a maximum\nof 20 people took part before an\naudience of about i+}0. Another 2,350\nstudents were not interested enough to\nattend to discuss either the Carnival or\nthe mode of election of the President\n(which was also on th\u00a3 Agenda). I find\nit hard to believe that these people are\nresponsible or interested enough to select\na anyone. It is rather difficult to take Mr.\nMercer's hysterical outburst, seriously.\nD. Wilbraham.\nDear Sir,\nWho is the idiot who wants women in\nthe Bar ? The men of I.C. are almost\nalone in their resolution to keep\nwomen in their place. If we let women\nenter the Bar, the thin end of the wedge\nwill have been inserted. Having\nobtained entry into that male Holy-of Ho lies, the Bar. they will take an even\nlarger part in the running of our Union.\nIn fao t, Sir, they will o ulm in ate., In\nthe words of the Prophet, \"There will be\nweeping and gnashing of beer-mugs in that\nI.C. Bar.\"\nHow can any sane man allow women lit\nthe Bar ? The only result is that all the pure and innocent young ICWArians\nbecome less pure and innocent, w hio hI,, am sure you will admit is rather a pity*\nNo Sir, keep them out is the cry t Yours faithfully,\nA Wellwisher (Jim)\nand an ICWArian (Nameless)\n\n"

The R.C.S. contingent seeing them pass the end of\nImperial Institute Road, realised that\nthere were about 100 people in the party\nSince any R.C.S. man is equal to two\nGuildsmen R.C.S. took a party of about\n50 down to Putney.\nThey maro he d down to Gloucester Road\nStation where the President lead the\na asua lt. The.ticket collector wisely\nstood to one side. A change of trains\nat Earls Court Station lead to arap la deploying of forces; thus four people at\npoints along the platform confidently\ncalling\" All change please\" resulted in an empty train going to Ealing. At Putney Bridge Station the party\npassed through by saying \"Tickets at the\nback\" The last member walked through\nwithout saying anything. Thus.;:the. party\narrived at the Boat\"House in great spirits, only to find that Guilds had indulged in a dastardly attack on Jez-e bel. The wrath of the party oo ul d not be o on tai ned and the R.C. S.oon ting ent was lead rapidly along the towpath 30 that its members oo ul d \"get at\" Guilds.\nThis year the President of R.C.S. had challenged the President of Guilds\nto a duel:-Custard pies at three feet. This took place with all due ceremony\nbut not before the Guilds president\nhad been forced to apologise for the\ndisgusting atta ok on Jezebel.\nAfter the Presidents duel, which\nlike the main contest resulted in a most\nhonorable draw, the two parties \"had at\"\none another. It hau been decided that\nthis year Mascots should not be involved\nin the battle so they were placed to 'one\nside.. It must be noted that during the\nbattle the President of Guilds saw that\nthey mig at be( damaged so he removed both\nmascots to a safe place.\nAt the beginning of the contest\nGuilds rushed madly at R.C.S., but were\nspeedily repelled by only a few of the\n3 cw t. of rotten apple3 that.R.C.S. possessed. R.C.S. then followed up\nthis initial rout by chasing tj je Guilds-men and indulging in-some magnificent\nhand to hand fig hi ngv In this^ the\"\nVice President of Guilds was captured\nand despite his repeated bellows of\n\"Guilds!: Guilds:! \" none of his men \\1)\nhad sufficient courage to attempt a resT HE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE cue, so that the Vice Presidents trou s ers were soon flying with several other\nGuildsmen's trousers from the trees.\nIt must be noted that the Vice President\nof Guilds was the only member of either\nexecutive to loose his trousers.\nThe struggle for power waxed to and\nfro along the tow-path, atta ok followed\nattack followed counter attack and Guilds,\ndespite their vastly superior numbers,\ncould max e no impression on the R.C.S. ranks. The battle raged.on and on;\nGuilds had used up their apples, o ii eir flour bags, and their tomatoes,K. Co.\ntoo hid run out of ammunition; it was\nno* a question of tre menu ou a hand to\nhand fighting. It was obvious .that\nGuilds would never daunt the i<.Co. spirit, yet R.C.S. could never quite gain\nthe upper hand. A short truce and a conference between Presidents only res-ul ted in fiercer attacks, but then the\nPresidents decided that a draw was a fair result so the mascots were restored,\nBrough found his trousers and the two\ncolleges lined the banks to watch the\nraces.\nThe colleges decided that since the\nresult was a draw, neither President had\nwon, so each College casually tossed its own President into the Thames.\nSie final memory of the day was the\namazing sight of 150 R.C.S. and Guildsmen\nplaying Ring 0-Ring of Roses round two\"\nLondon Transport buses and four cars on\nPutney Bridge a fitting end to a tremendous afternoon of sport.\n-mat\n\n"

Whenever Streatham did get the\nball, particularly from the line-outs\nthe I.C. wing forwards, Kehoe and\nConnor, bottled up the half-backs very\neffectively.

The Wanderer's XV (BA)\nare now the only team who have won every\nmatch. The main difficulty has not\nbeen finding players but in finding\nmatches for them to play in. There\nseems to be a very good team spirit throughout the club and the teams should go on from strength to strength.\nOn November 12th the 1st XV, with\n5 players from the University side,\njust lost a very close game with the\nLondon Welsh Druids. The score was\n8-10. Both teams scored two tries. The Druids however scored under the\nposts and converted. I.C. crossed\ntheir opponents line on three other\noccasions, but the referee did hot\nallow a try. On Saturday last the Ex 1st XV\ndid very well to hold the London Welsh\nDragons to a33 draw.

Guilds Entertainments Committe is presenting, as the\nsubject of its yearly report to the\nCollege, a startling view of the origins of the Shakespeare Plays, and a daring\nexpose' of the Elizabethan Regime. They\nfeel that the Nation has been under an\nillusion on this subject for too long,\nand that this years Carnival will settle the matter beyond all doubt.\nHowever, do not be so,awed by the\nerudition of the subject that you forget\nto enjoy yourself, and to this end rem*\nember to bring a girl l THE VETERANS VENUE JEZEBEL.\nDespite earlier predictions by the pe asia iata, Sunday morning was clear and sunny a eat8.0 a.m. we set off to Hyde Park to join the Queens of oars going down to Brighton.
