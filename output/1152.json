    "content": "Arts Felix \u2022 11 October 1999\nmethod A Notes from a Big\nCountry\nby Bill Bryson\nBlack Swan \u00a3 6 . 9 9\nBill Bryson has already cast\nhis eye over Britain, resulting in the hugely popular Notes From A Small Island.\nNow this genial American has returned to the lan d of his birth along with his\nEnglish wife and children. Since returning to the US he has produced a weekly\ncolumn for the Mail on Sunday, and his latest book is an anthology of these\nminiature essays.\nHe manages to poke fun at\nthose ridiculous aspects of\nUS and British life in a way\nwhich is essentially, well, nice. There is no other\nword to describe Bill's style\n(and after reading this\nbook, you will be on first\nname terms as well). By the\nend of his previous book I was finding his self der oga tory, confessional style a little wearing, but Notes From A Big Country lends\nitself to random dipping-in.\nThis would be the perfect\npaperback for sneaking into lectures. However there are two fatal flaws.\nFirstly, at least twice in\nevery page laughter bursts\nquite uncontrollably from my mouth. This may draw attention in the lecture theatre . Secondly, your professors will make you to lend it to them. East by Steven Berkoff.\nVaudeville Theatre\nNearest Tube Charring Cross \u00a310 Concessions\nSteven Berkoff: the Bad Boy of British theatre. A skinhead who swears a lot. He really swears a lot. I mean we are talking making Quentin Tarentino look like Jane Austin. Never have I visited a theatre and been subject to such a raping and violating of the senses. At times ' Cunt' was virtually a preposition. Ok, so we' ve established that\nthis is not one to take your Granny to, but it is a play with an under lying raw strength.\nIndeed, a piece of theatre to enlist a strong response, whether of\nhate for it or love for it (a\" Marmite\" play, if you will). It is not subtle\nand it is not pretentious, giving us a slice of life from the East End,\noften revealing the base instincts which lie within us all. We see all forms of baseness as the characters lurch from place to place; sexual\nconquest, racism, gluttony, incest and violence.\nThe original performance of this play was performed in the Edinburgh Fringe about20 years ago, in which Berkoff played the main part. The character who has taken over his role certainly had a lot to\nlive up to, at times looking a little weaker than the others.\nI did feel that at points in this play Berkoff was dwelling in and glorifying the violence, wading in his misogynistic libido with no real pur-pose. He does do this with skill and power but beneath all the violence and F's and C's, at some points the play seemed empty.\nThe imagery of the fight and motorcycle scenes were fantastic, conjured up by Berkoff's torrent of graphic language and forceful style.\nThe acting was fantastic. I was in awe of the extreme polish, intense\nphysical strength and pre sc en ce that all (and I mean all) the actors\ngenerated. I will certainly go and see it again. Ido certainly recommend it. The\nplay has a slick and astute humor, supported by a lambent and perfectly timed live piano music. This is an example of how theatre can be used, you will be blown away by its power.\nID Ben\nThe Arts In London\nIf you are new to London let me assure\nyou, that so far as the Arts are concerned you have come to the right city.\nThe volume and diversity here are ENORMOUS. Take a look in Time Out and the ICU Students Handbook and see for yourselves just how much cool stuff there is out there.' Even this will\nonly scratch the surface. Whether it be theatre, art galleries, museums, musicals or books; this is the place to be.\nPeople travel from all over the world to\nsee West End theatre and now you can walk there. Queuing outside large West\nEnd theatres an hour before the show often gets you student stand by tickets.\nThis is a good way of obtaining the best\nseats in the house for only a fraction of the price.\nIt can be expensive, but it can also be free. The National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery and parts of the Tate are all free. The Serpentine Gallery and Victoria and Albert Museum are both free\nand only two minutes walk away.\nLondon is obviously a popular choice for book signings and premieres of all\nsorts. So the biggest names can be seen.\nThese are the Arts pages were you can see the Arts world reviewed by you and your peers. If you would like to be part\nof the Arts team and so be hated by all\nactors, director and writers in London please contact felix@ ic.a c.uk. So now\nthat you are here, make the most of it.\nEnjoy.\n' Ben ID Tom "

    "content": "10 Feedback Felix \u2022 11 October 1999\nAnother year, another columnist,\nanother bout of s lagging off the\nmedics. Well, maybe not. That's not the point of this one... this column is going to look right at the\nheart of this Union, week in and\nweek out, and tell it like it is.\nWhether you, or Tasha Newton,\nlikes it or not. Okay? Let's get a few ground rules straight, so that\nthe rest of the year is put into con-text...\nWe, the students of Imperial\nCollege elect six students into sabbatical positions each year. Two of\nthese are \"special\" positions; one\nis the editor of this august publication - that is, he solely has the\nresponsibility to produce this\nnewsletter week in, week out. The\nother is the sabbatical President of\nICSM SU, a position introduced by\nEric Allsop in 1997 when it was\nfelt that medics would not want to\nstand for general ICU positions.\nThe ICSM President is responsible\nfor all aspects of the welfare and\nextra-curricular life of medics at\nIC. In addition, we have an ICU\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices), who is constitutionally\nresponsible for the bars, catering\noutlets, shops and also setting\ngeneral budgets for the Union\n(including the medics), an ICU\nDeputy President (Clubs and Societies), who assists the Club Chairpersons in any way he can, representing their concerns to the\nUnion, and an ICU Deputy President (Education and Welfare), a new position introduced'this year,\nwho is responsible for ensuring the\nUnion provides adequate representation and services for its members in areas such as welfare (sur-pri singly) and academic matters.\nAll of these sabbatical officers\nare responsible to ICU Council,\nyour democratically elected representatives, and not (much to her\nchagrin) to the ICU President, who\nin fact has such a small job\ndescription, it is better to tell you\nwhat she does NOT do. She does\nNOT go around introducing members of the Union (i.e. your) staff\nas \"her staff\" to both the Chancellor of the University of London and\nnew student staff, she does not\nintroduce a fellow sabbatical officer to the Pro Rector (Educational\nQuality) as \"her Education and\nWelfare Officer\", and she does\no in t not demote the sabbatical who\nruns this fine independent newspaper to \"her magazine editor\".\nWhat's the point of this? Why\nbadmouth the Union before it's even had time to get going? Well,\nfor this simple reason. ICU does\nnot work properly, and has not\ndone for years. Students don't get\ninvolved, don't tell people what\nthey want to happen - none of this\n\"Talk to Tasha\" crap. Let's take an\nexample:\nFor years, College have been\ntrying to build a new sports centre\nat South Kensington. The local\nresidents association seems to\nhave finally caved into the idea,\nbut the Union is now refusing full\nsupport, saying that \"it is not in\nthe interest of one-fifth of the student body\". Who in the Union\nopposed it? Tasha Newton. Did\nshe consult ICU Council? No.\nWhy? Because to build the sports\ncentre, the College needs to sell\none of its three sports grounds,\ni.e. Teddington. El Presidente's argument is that the medics want\nto \"keep\" Teddington (it's no\nlonger theirs by the way - an Act of\nParliament saw to that in 1988 -it's \"ours\"), and so one-fifth of\n\"her\" members (i.e. ICSM under-graduates) would rather not see a sports centre.\nFACT ONE: The larger component of ICSM is the old Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nSchool, who couldn't give two\nhoots about Teddington.\nFACT TWO: There is enough\nspace at Harlington, IC's main\nsports ground, for every IC and\nICSM team to play a home game\nat the same time\nFACT THREE: IC is one of the\nfew remaining universities without\na decent sports centre.\nSo come on, mobil is e. Get\ndown to the first ICU Council\ntomorrow, and get yourself elected to the remaining places.\nMedics get what they want\nbecause they shout the loudest -shout louder! Do you want a Sports Centre? Do you want to\nkeep Teddington? Have a view.\nUse it. It's what democracy is all\nabout...\nThe appa ling performance against dire opposition of the bunch of Medics on University\nChallenge a few weeks ago suggests to Kevin\nthat the selection process for the Imperial College teams needs overhauling. Imperial, like a number of other institutions can enter two\nteams. Presently one team is organised by the\nMedic's Union, the other by ICU's quiz so cie ty. This year only the Medic's team, none of\nwhom had any concrete links with IC, qualified\nfor the televised rounds. University Challenge\nis a team game, which requires a team to win\nit, not four individuals. Students should form\nthemselves into teams, which then compete\nagainst each other, in a centralised com pet i tion, with the best two teams going on to represent the college, regardless of CCU. Such a system would encourage diversity in backgrounds of the team members. The quiz show\nshould not be the place for childish student\nbets. Like Mr Paxman, Kevin is unaware of the\nwork of \"Wango\".\nBasics staff are phoned on an almost nightly\nbasis by Sherfield Security, who inform them\nthat they \"have a fire alarm\". Usually, the hapless staff member apologise s for their incompetence, and quickly serves the offending\nburnt pizza before the escapade is noticed by\ntheir manager. The residents of the above\nSouthside halls are not disturbed. Kevin understands why this arrangement is in place. Due to\nthe frequency of fire alarms last year, by the\nend of the year-many staircases had an un of fi MishMash A Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\ncia l rota - only one person would bother going\nto find out what was going on following an\nalarm. If the alarms went off every time something burnt in Basics, they would be universally ignored.\nIf you have just moved into Southside halls you\nmay be wondering why your window has been\nblocked from opening properly. The windows\nare barred because college administration is\nscared of 'the residents'. Students are residents\ntoo, and perhaps we should follow the lead\ngiven to us by other universities where students\nhave managed to drive the locals so mad with\ntheir student-y antics, that they have moved out\nof the area immediately surrounding the uni-vers it y. The property in this area then plummets\nin price and becomes affordable for students.\nOver time the students region of influence\ngrows, usually until the students have conquered a large region of the town or city.\nMedic's names could be Mud by the time\nthey've finished their degrees. Across Europe\nover the last few decades there has been an\nattempt to differentiate between academic and\nmedical 'doctors'. It is likely that this trend will\nreach the UK in our lifetimes. One of Kevin's favourites is seen in The Czech Republic where\na medical doctor's name is literally mud. A doctor who in the UK would be addressed, \"Dr\nMash\", would in Czech be, \"MUDr Mash\".\nAs for this year's Union Handbook, suffice to\nsay Kevin hears it was proof-read by at least\nfive different people.\nFor more from Kevin:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\n\n"

Rubbish.\nBen & Jason\nAir Guitar\nGO! Beat\nComing from their summer Emoticons album, Air Guitar is another\nclassic Ben & Jason track. There's all the usual niceness and the track\nis modern day easy listening at it's finest. Although often accused of\nsounding like Radiohead in their\nearly days Ben & Jason are definitely worth looking out for and if\nyou've any cash from your Student\nLoan, getting your hands on this or\none of their albums wouldn't be a bad idea.\nIggy Pop\nCorruption\nVirgin\nA collaboration with Hollywood\nheartthrob Jonny Depp, Corruption\nis Iggy at his best. His singing is\nharsh and precise and the tunes is\npunk y enough to get your bopping\njust a few seconds after the disc has\nbegun to spin.

The hiring of a producer made the\nmusic much easier on\nthe ear, but sadly something was lost in the\nall edged upgrade.\nMajor Leagues is Pavement at their nicest,\nand as such it's not\nPavement at their best.\nGive me a slanted and\nenchanted sound any\nday.\nIDDDD\nIan Brown\nLove Like a Fountain\nSony\nLove Like a Fountain\nsings a new sound for\nMr Brown. The voice\nis distorted, the beats\nare electro and there's enough squeaks and\nsquiggles to satisfy\neven the most hungry\nlistener. Sadly however\nall these sounds don't add up to a classic\ntrack, and Mr Brown\nwould be better off\nsticking to a his trusty\nguitars and drums\nbacking.\nEmbrace\nHooligan\nHut\nA Beckish sound from the boys\nwho've been promising much for\nquite some time. Hooligan is a good track, but it's not of the standard Embrace claim to be capable\nof. The guitar strumming is nice,\nthe singing is sweet and there's a great yeah yeah yeah bit, but even\nthe extra use a kazoo doesn't lift the\nsound quite high enough. Please\ntry harder boys.\nBernard Butler\nYou Must Go On\nCreation\nBernard Butler must be pretty gutted that he'll never make as good a record as he did with Suede or with\ncollaborator David McAlmont.\nIndeed for Mr Butler making music\nis one of those things that should\ndefinitely remain a group activity.\nHaving said that though, You Must\nGo On isn'ta bad tune but it is\nhorribly average and in a world\nwhere we seek perfection I'm afraid\nthis isn't good enough.\nThe Charlatans\nForever\nUniversal\nWith a new album Us\n& Us Only out next\nweek, The Charlatans\nlay down the foundations well with Forever.\nTim Burgess's voice\nsmoothly sails the\nwaves of funky bass\nand electro keyboards\nas the song cruises\nthrough it's five minute\njourney across the\nstereo.

In my view, I'm bloody fed up with the\nthing, and being served\nit again on this compilation has probably clouded my view of an album which on the\nwhole isn't too bad. There's tracks from the\nDirty Beatniks, the wonderfully english Les\nRythmes Digitales and even the superb History\nRepeating from the Propellerheads which has\nstood the test of time\nmuch better than some of the tracks on this\nalbum. The tracks range from1995 and1999 and it\nis really the newer tracks\nthat are the better, This\nisn'ta bad thing for the\nlabel though for it's a sign that they're improv ing. Thus this compi l ation is not one I'd rec-om men d,andI suggest\nyou' d look elsewhere.\nPatrick\nfrequency\nChris Cornell\nEuphoria Morning\n(A&M Records)\nIt's been a couple of years since Soundgarden split up, and Euphoria Morning is the first solo record from their former frontman Chris Cor nell. He's moved from Seattle to Los Angeles and taken his time to\nproduce an album that's been hotly anticipated by both fans and the\nmusic press.\nMusically, this is a much more laid back and bluesy affair than his\nlast band's output, and more of a showcase for his own talents. It's mellow, but often epic in scope, with swirling keyboards comp le men ting a nicely modulated guitar sound. There's a large bit of sonic\ndiversity but the overall general feel of the music is fairly consistent.\nIt's pleasant to listen to, and uplifting, in an easy-going kind of way.\nThe album ranges from the solo, acoustic Sweet Euphoria, to more richly layered (courtesy of production from Cornell and bandmates Natasha S hn eider and Alain Johannes) sounds of Flutter Girl. First\nsingle Can't Change Me opens and( in French) closes the album, a lovely song with a great chorus, and one of the more accessible\ntracks. Steel Rain, the last proper track, is also the longest, not quite\nan epic, but long enough to fit in a longer solo than most others;\nquite a nice one, too. The whole album has a bit of an epic feel -not drawn out, but impressive in scope and ambition. Cornell's lyrics cover the well-trodden ground of love, loss, hope and faith. They're more personal and intimate than Soundgarden' s, and their tone is melancholic, even depressing if you read them alone. Despite this, the songs are upbeat and inspiring, hinting at the\neuphoria of the record's title.\nThe finished product is a bit of a masterpiece, really. There are no bad songs, and nothing that could really be considered filler material\n(with the possible exception of the French version of Can't Change Me, although this is more of a bonus track). It's consistently good, rather than being focused on a couple of obvious singles. All in all\nwell worth a look. \u2022 Gareth Tom Jones\nReload\n(Gut Records)\nWhat can you say about Tom \"Taffy\"\nJones? He s done the lot, worshiped by\nElvis, courted by Sinatra and been bombarded by countless items of ladies\nunderwear. He was toot linga long nicely\nbeing a classic performer. But thats not\ngood enough he has to be down with\nthe kids too now. While the acts\ninvolved are of a high caliber( general-ly)\nThe best song on this album of duets\nand collaborations is the one you have\nalready probably heard.\" Burning down the house\" with The Cardigans is a great cover of a Talking Heads track.\nNothing else really comes close - \"Little\nGreen Bag\" with the Bare Naked ladies\nis a pretty hard song to cover badly -they almost manage it. \"Baby, it'scold outside\" gains marks for Cerys's impossibly throaty voice, and50' s throwback production and the classic lyrics. While most of the acts on the album are pretty\nmainstream performers - Portishead are\ndefinitely a little off the beaten track.\nTheir collaboration with Tom is a cover of \" Motherless Child\". Eminetly suitable\nfor their gloomy production and Toms\nwarbling. Apart from the tracks from The Cardigans and Portishead I would most definitely unload this heinous compilation. Joel\nChris Cornell is playing Shepherd's Bush Empire tonight. Tickets are\n\u00a3 12.50. For info call 020 7771 2000. A review for this event will\nappear in next weeks frequency.\n\n"

To those involved in\nactive research it maybe found in\nthe mess and unpredictability of the\nlab. To philosophers, the nature of science has always posed a bit of a problem; they are unable most of the time to agree whether the world really exists. They find it even har der to accept the one view of the world that science has to offer But\nit is hard to deny that it has been extraordinarily successful at explaining nature.\nHas science become a victim of its own success? To many non scientists, the ideas and methods of\nscience remain a mystery. This lack\nof understanding leads to black and white views of science. For some, science is a source of unrealistic hopes, for example that\nevery disease will be cured. And for others it is a source of hostility and fear, leading to new problems of nuclear weapons and global poll u tion. What is it about the nature of science that is so easily misunderstood? In his book \"The Unnatural\nNature of Science\", Lewis W ol pert argues that science involves a very\nunnatural way of thinking, totally\nunlike everyday commonsense thinking. According to Professor\nW ol pert, the birth of science occurred only once in history,\naround600 BC in Greece. Techno logy has been around much longer and W ol pert argues that science\nand technology were strangers to each other until recently. It seems\nthat there is a big difference between rolling a heavy rock along on a couple of logs, and understanding the reduction in friction\nthat makes the job easier. Given that science is our best hope of understanding nature, he claims it\nshould have a special status com OPENING HOURS BAGUETTE BAR (dBS) - 11AM DAVINCI'S NOON2 PM5.308.30 PM2 PM STAFF REQUIRED\nSTAFF ARE REQUIRED FROM NOON-2.30\nAND 5.30 - 9.30PM PLEASE CONTACT IAN OR YVONNE ON\n48080 (0171 594 8080) IF INTERESTED\n/CUI YOUR UNION - BE PART OF IT\npared to other areas of knowledge. These are very seductive ideas if\nyou area scientist.\nTo Harry Collins and Trevor\nPinch, science is more like ago lem. The go lem is a creature from Je wish folklore, made from clay and brought to life by spells. In some legends it is given special powers to turn lead into gold but it can become dangerous if it is not con trolled. In their book \"The GolemWhat Everyone should know about\nScience\", the authors use the an a logy of' go lem science' to avoid simplistic views of science as all good or all bad. They believe that\nhowever successful scientific the o ries are, science remains at heart a human enterprise, and is therefore\nfallible and untidy. \" One cannot ask of scientists...that they be no longer human\", and yet they are expected to deliver absolute cer-ta in ty. There is much public confusion about.the way science is done. The cold, dispassionate scientist is supposed to be above outside influences that affect ordinary lives.\nLewis W ol pert suggests that scientists are partly to blame for creating\nthis illusion of the' scientific method', because they write all their papers as if there was one. These tidy, impersonal texts, written\nwith the help of perfect hindsight\nleave no room for the creativity or doubts of the scientist. Collins and Pinch believe that the way ambiguous results are interpreted may have more to do with social politics\nthan is generally believed. This is\nnot just a case of bad science. They\nillustrate their arguments with fascinating stories from the history of\nscience, that show how far from reality is the scientific myth.\nBoth these books are entertainingly and persuasively written. But\nin deciding whether science is special or more like ago lem, it is\nimportant not to confuse arguments over methods and contents.\nWolpert's emphasis is on the findings of science, it is these that he finds counter-intuit ve. On the other\nhand, Collins and Pinch are concerned with how science is done and whether it bears any relation to\nthe scientific myth.\nW ol pert attacks social views of\nscience, because he thinks they are irrelevant for working scientists.\nCollins and Pinch agree that the image of ' go lem science' maybe unhelpful in day-to-day research.\nBut it is when science enters the public domain that it becomes dangerous to treat it as infallible.\nIn the UK it is usual for the\nHome Office to provide one scientist to present forensic evidence in\ncourt cases. This has the distorting\neffect of imp ly ing that such evi-den ce is impartial and infallible. In\nrecent years there have been a number of cases where terrorist\nconvictions were overturned because of dod gy forensic evi-den ce. Not surprisingly this has shaken the public' s faith in such\nevidence and is the result of c lai ming too much for science.\nW ol pert also worries about the\npublic understanding of science.\nHe thinks we should be clear about what science can and cannot do. His remedy for improving the situation is to teach more scientific facts\nto the person on the street. Collins and Pinch think this approach is\nunhelpful when the public has to\ndeal with scientific controversies. If\nscientific facts are supposed to\nreveal a' special' type of truth\nabout the world, then how should citizens react when presented with\ntwo versions of the 'truth'? If scientists were treated more like experts\nof the natural world, and less like\ngods, then the public could cope with divided scientific opinion, as\nthey do with other expert advice. The divide between the approach of ' go lem science' and' special science' to teaching sci-en ce in the classroom is even wider.\nW ol pert wants more emphasis on the unnatural nature of scientific\nideas when compared to common sense ones. But confusingly, he\nalso wants children to see science\nas less alien. Collins and Pinch\nhope that the lesson of untidy, fallible ' go lem science' can be learned\nat an early age. Teachers have a habit of tidying up messy experimental results into the neat, scientific myth in the textbook. But children should be told that the problems of the classroom lab, also\ntake place in the grownup world of\nproper scientists in white coats.\n\n"

Packed with a young mixed crowd their's no room for at ti tude, but plenty of space for those up for a good time.\nAfter two crazy nights\nthere in September it's been creeping up my\nfavourite club night\nchart, with only the early\nclosing at 3 . 3 0 am kee ping it from moving too high. However, if you don't mind leaving for half an hour and paying to get in again you can step back into Turnmills\nfor Trade and stay till the\nnext afternoon. Beware the innocent here though, Trade is a not a club for the narrow minded! Next week at Headstart\nsees Andrea Parker, Carl Clark and Octopus on the bill and would be a very good introduction\nto London clubbing, with\nno dressing up required. Simon frequency\nhome vs Fabric\nWere they ready for the launch?\nApart from the millenium parties, the most talked about happenings in\nclub culture this year were the opening of two new Superclubs here in\nLondon. It was billed as heavyweight battle with both clubs with different strengths, but both with the same goal; to give the title of Britain\nbiggest and best club to London. Until this autumn it was widely\nregarded that that title lay with Liverpool for Cream, or Sheffield for Gatecrasher. For anyone who shouts Ministry of Sound, all I'd say is:\nhave you been to Cream? Anyway back to the battle. In one corner it was much hyped home, of homelands fame and with no capital letter. A Leicester Square loc ation and being set over a massive seven home meant business. Also a promise of a strict door policy to keep it a club for c lubbers rather\nthan the random lost looking tourists who normally inhabit the Square.\nIn the other corner was Fabric. Set in Farringdon and with a generous week long license including a24 hr music and dancing license from Thursday to Sunday, it looked like Fabric was the perfect partner to home to ensure a battle that pushed both contenders to their limits.\nSadly though, after more than just a couple fuck ups the battle is yet to\nbegin! home( yes, even here with a small letter) opened upon time, but there\nwas exposed building work still going on and a number of other\nteething problems. Fabric, however, didn't even get it's doors open for the launch party! A pretty poor showing then, which was a definite\nshame, but I'm sure that when the battle does commence it will well\nworth it. Frequency will be previewing the delayed Fabric launch next\nweek, and when visits have been paid to the respective venues you will\nbe able to read about the first y round of the battle here.

    "content": "11 October 1999 * Felix Interview |\nWho Really Runs This Place?\nIn the first of an occasional series of interviews with College's senior staff, Felix interviews Tim\nClark and tries to work out what the title Pro Rector (Educational Quality) really means...\nSo, what do you do?\nWell, I acton behalf of the Rector on matters\neducational, and although the title says Educational Quality it's more about the totality of\nquality of the students life, so it's not only the\nquality of their education, it's about the qu ali ty of their life, so halls of residence, the Union, health matters and soon, and I try to acton behalf of the rector, promoting the students\nquality of life. But, Ido this in an on manage rial way, so I have to act within the other structures of College, so in a sense I'm there to keep an eye on the students... However, it\ndoes divide broadly into education, and I chair the undergraduate and graduate studies committee, which has oversight for all teaching, and Ideal with the T QA[ quality assessment]\nvisits, where I try to ensure that we achieve good scores, and in that I'm very much helped by registry.\nThe quality of the students life outside their\neducation I pick upon through the College Tutors, the student Councillors and the student\nWelfare Committee, but again I'm not in\ncharge of anything directly... But the College Tutors and Iwork very closely together, and in\nthat way we pickup on generic College issues\nconcerning students. The Student Councillors do report to me and although it's entirely\nanonymous I can get an idea of what problems are concerning students. Finally, through links with the Health Centre I can get a feel for what's going on. The other aspect is the Halls of Residence Igo round the Halls, I meet the\nWardens, and one of the College Tutors is\nparticularly concerned with accommodation issues, so I pick up all these areas. In addition I have regular meetings with, and try to keep in close contact with, ICU,s oI can hopefully help them and acton behalf of the rector and on behalf of the students - because I don't just\nwork for the Rector, I also advise him on the most effective course of action to take and I think it's a very useful role. You're seen as the most Union friendly member\nof the College hierarchy - do you think that's an integral part of the job?\nWell, I hesitate to say I'm here to protect the students, that would be wrong, but on the\nother hand Ido like to see myself as the students champion because it may often be difficult for the president and the others a bbs to know their way around at first, so I see my role\nto help protect and defend their case. In other universities I might see my position as similar to that of the Dean of Students, except that\nhere I don't have an office. The distinction is\nthat here the Pro Rectors have a kind of over-arching vie w over all College activities, but we operate through the established machine but\nI actually think that that's a good thing because it means that we can't try to exert our influence through management control, because we don't have any managerial control... But indirectly I pick upon all the problems facing students, and it's through regular meetings with ICU, with the Tutors, with the\nWardens and the Health Centre that I pick upon what's going on, as well as by reading Felix\nand always keeping my door open. What decision or change do you look back on\nand feel proud of?\nI'd like to think that I'm responsible for resolving the Clay ponds issue ( although again that\nwasn't entirely me directly). I'd like to think that\nin every planning round I help to bring about a happy resolution between College and the\nUnion; I'd like to think that I was very closely\ninvolved in the Beit refurbishment project,\nwhich I think is very important, to show us away in which we can renovate our halls to a good standard, and if we can do that then it\nwill help with the entire refurbishment programme. I think I 've played a role in main tai ning the idea that IC is a residential College, and through my review of the Conference Office I helped to identify to the entire College what an important role conferencing has to\nplay in benefiting the students, both by\nemploying students and generating a surplus\nwhich can be reinvested into student residences. Finally, I'd like to think that I 've helped to foster a better relationship with our neighbours, by working with Professor Alexander on the liaison committee which helps, of course, when we want to work on projects like the new Sports Centre... How do you see the College's attitude to students and student services developing?\nIf Beit works like we want it to work then I think\nwe do have a major task in upgrading the\naccommodation we offer to first year students,\nand I hope we will be able to wire up all the\nHalls via I Connect, so if we are going to\nremain a residential College which I think is\nvitally important we have a major task facing us in ren nova tring all of our accommodation. And if at the sametime we can improve our relationship with our neighbours, so that\nthey're happy with what we're doing, I think\nthat would be very important. Another target I have before I leave is to improve the prospects for learning and teaching, and we're about to set up a centre for educational development which, I hope will\nbring together the various aspects of the courses we run, to look critically at how our students learn and how wet each, and thus we can raise the profile of teaching within a very\nresearch dominated environment. I think that's going to be a very uphill task, but fortunately\nI'm very impressed by the attitude of our staff\nto teaching they do take teaching very seriously, and I think that's been reflected in our T QA scores. Nonetheless, Ido see one of my\nmissions as the promotion of teaching and learning, and to review the introduction of new technologies. So, if I 've improved the quality of\nour halls and the quality of our teaching by the\ntime I leave then I 'll feel I 've achieved enough. One other innovation that's occurred during my time that I'm very proud of is the development of the private office, which helps students\nin attempting to find private accommodation, which I realise is a big struggle for a lot of our students.\nWould teaching quality be improved by more\ntraining for lecturers?\nOh yes - one of the main tasks of the new Educational Development centre will be to bring forward all of our current training workshops into a single programme which will provide the\nfoundation for all of our staff to become members of the new institute for learning and teaching. And although we're going to have to look at all these courses once again, it's all part of the idea that our teachers should gain in professional standing and profile, and we should provide the correct training for them. Basically, we're taking what's already there and making it more standardised and formalised. And finally, what are your plans for the future?\nWell I was contracted for four years and I 've\ncurrently done two, but I'm still a member of the NHL I and I still have an active interest in\nasthma and work with the NHS, so I 've got a pretty active schedule. But with regard to my\ncurrent role, I 've got two years left and by then\nthe new rector will have become settled and might have plans for the role or forme in particular. Until then I 'll continue to develop what I 've done and pursue all the topics I 've already mentioned. "

Tickets sales were bad enough that iCU saw them coming and a cunning plan to ask College for the difference was hatched. Mr. David Hell ard, the then. President,\ndid a lot of ground work and begging and College smiled on him. There were always going to be con ditions for the payment, they arrived\nafter I took office. The deal was thus....\n- The Ball should be held in or close\nto South Ken, if at al! possible.\n- The Medic Ball and( for want of a better word) ' non medic' Balls\nshould be separated by date, rather\nthan 2 4 hours.\nAnyone who wants to see the full\ntext is welcome to see it, it's even less\ninteresting than this letter though!\nSo to summarize; No money will\nbe taken from the strategic reserves,\nthe Beit Project is safe from this point\nof view. Iwo s never faced with the\noption of having to ban the medics\nfrom a2000 Summer Ball, one day one President will be, but by then the\nidea is the medics will be fully in te grated. ICU still wholly believes in\nstudent input and there will be d Summer Ball committee for both\nBalls (if either group can elect a chair), the Ents and Marketing ma nager will have more input, as will\nother permanent staff, in the hope we don't lose as much cash. Continued losses of this kind could finish the\nSummer Ball for good. ICU has been\nlooking into options for complying\nwith College's request to have the\nBall closer to home( we would not\nhave said yes if it hadn't been p ossi ble). It will be up to the committee to\ndecide how this goes forward.\nSo, hope this cleared up a few\nthings. Sorry none of you came over\nto talk about this before it went to\npress.\nSee you soon, Tashd\nFeedback\nCAUGHT RED HANDED Dear Kevin\nYes, I happily own up to being the prat who made arrangements for the RC S,C&G and MSc/ MBA fresher s' welcomes in the Great Hall to have overflow facilities in\nthe Pip p ard lecture theatre.\nIn recent years we have had to hire the main lecture theatre in the Royal\nGeographical Society, which holds760 people, to host these\nevents. Now that the Great Hall has been refurbished with a maximum capacity of 7 2 0 , there no longer appeared justification for spending College money hiring a hall only marginally larger than what the College had available itself.\nIt is impossible to gauge accurately how many students will turn\nup on these occasions so with\nincreasing student numbers I erred\non the side of caution and arranged for overflow facilities in\nPip p ard. They proved to be necessary for RCS and to a lesser extent\nC&G.S ono conspiracy or cock up theory - unless you include the Rector's microphone being off for a while!\nYours sincerely\nVernon McClure Academic Registrar\nTHE WEEKLY RANT Dear Sir,\nImperial College is not known for supporting, or even ac know led g ing the existence of, its undergraduate students. However, the college sport & leisure division has spent copious amounts of money,\ntime, and resources trying to improve the quality of sporting\nprovision for the students of Imperial.\nIam therefore greatly disappointed to discover that the Imperial College Union president is not\nfully backing the current sports\ncentre proposal. This facility is desperately needed by many students,\nespecially those involved in indoor sports such as basketball and volleyball. Every year, the volleyball\nteam have to turn away beginners\nand competitive players alike due to the lack of indoor space in\nwhich to practice. Iam confused as to why students would elect such a person who obviously does not put\ntheir needs first, and instead has embarked on some kind of d illusion ed power trip in an attempt to annoy and dominate those around her.\nAnd another thing: Perhaps them dj or it y of medical students are against the sports centre proposal as it has been hinted Teddington sp or ts ground will be sold to\nfinance the development. But pe ople are forgetting that there are medical students on the South Kensington campus, and the gr n dud l, but important, integration of medical students into the clubs &\nsocieties of ICU, means that this\ndevelopment will eventually benefit\nall the students of Imperial College. Sometimes people in such positions of power forget that they\nare not at the top of the union structure. It is the students who come first. Those elected have\nfound themselves where they are because we thought they would do a good job and uphold our views.\nPerhaps we were all mistaken and easily de cie ved. AND FINALLY...\nDear Felix,\nCongrats on a fine looking first\nissue but I must ask, where has the\ncat gone? Felix just doesn't look right without a cat adorning it's front page..

My Unilever journey\nbegan with a3 month summer placement working as an\nInformation Management trainee at Lever Brothers in Liverpool.\nIt was the experience of meeting such an extraordinary calibre of\npeople that led me to apply for the Unilever Company\nManagement Development Scheme (UCMDS) in my\npenultimate year at IC.\nSeveral rounds of gruelling interviews and a fantastic summer\nholiday later I arrived at Van den Bergh Foods ready to face the\nsurreal world of Flora Marathons, Mr Pepperami and PG Chimps.\nFrom day one I was given instant responsibility, projects which\nwere clearly valued by the business. Like any challenging job the\nlearning curve is steep, but you're given every aspect of the\ntraining that you re gui re, from project management, through to\nnegotiation, mediation and even creativity training!\nWhat really attracted me to the Unilever graduate scheme was\nthe philosophy, that to be a successful senior manager you are\nre gui red to have a comprehensive cross-functional business\nunderstanding. So, the training scheme reflects this, in the form\nof second ment s providing variety coupled with cutting edge\nbusiness strategy - which is why the scheme is undisputed ly one\nof the best global graduate training opportunities.\nMy first project at Van den Bergh Foods was as leader of a European Extended Supply Chain Harmonisation Initiative or\nEESCHI for short! 11 can still remember arriving on my first day to\nbe presented with return tickets to Amsterdam.

In the year preceding\nuniversity and during the summer holidays, I worked on a number of different, very interesting projects both in the UK and\nin Germany. Although most of my time was spent on manufacturing and engineering projects, I also spent time in the\nPersonnel and Marketing functions. One of the aspects of the\nUnilever management training that I appreciated was the\nopportunity to learn about the business as a whole, through practical experience in a number of functions.\nWhen I graduated from Imperial College with an MEng in\nMechanical Engineering in 1 9 9 1 , I transferred to the Foods\nDivision as a hybrid technical / commercial trainee. During that\ntime I had a number of roles: Cost Accountant for our meat pie\nfactory, Project Manager for the relocation of some process\nequipment due to site closure, Materials Planner for Batchelors,\nShift Controller for our Tea Factory to name but a few. After\neighteen months I was given my first management position as a Production Planner. After a further eighteen months, I was\nappointed as the Project Manager implementing new supply\nchain processes and systems. I then left to have my first child\nafter which I returned to work full time as the Supply Chain\nManager for the Batchelors Business Group. After having my\nsecond child I returned to work four days a week in my current\ncapacity as a Supply Chain Project Manager. This involves\ndesigning and implementing a new organisation that is more focused on delivering supply chain excellence for our UK and\nEuropean customers.\nI have never regretted my decision to join Unilever. On several\noccasions I have considered moving on to broaden my\nexperience but despite other job offers, I have always chosen to\nstay. The package they offer is very competitive, especially the\nextras such as maternity benefit, pension, share save and health\ncare. The Unilever culture suits me and I like the people that I work with. I have always had very stretching and varied roles\nwith Unilever. They have also been very good at\naccommodating my personal wishes.\nI believe that Unilever will continue to offer challenging,\nrewarding careers in an ever-changing organisation.\nGood luck with your degrees and with the decisions you make\nregarding your careers.\nBe part of it.\n\n"

    "content": "What do I.C. Grads do when they leave college?\nCLAIRE ROBINS\nMechanical Engineering 1991 -1995\nI studied the Mechanical engineering four year course at\nImperial College, graduating in 1 9 9 5 . Unilever sponsored me during this time and I gained20 months industrial\nexperience, mostly in Unilever's margarine factories in both the UK and Europe. On graduation, I was invited to join their\nUnilever Companies Management Development Scheme. I joined Uni path in Bedford as a Technical Trainee and for two years I gained experience in engineering, production management and marketing. In 1 9 9 7 I became a Project\nManager, in the engineering department, buying, installing\nand commissioning production lines for the' Person a' contraceptive. I then moved on to become a Production Manager, leading my own team of operators, machines and engineers. There was a sudden downturn in demand for our product. Managing a large group of people whom have nothing to do all day has been one of the most challenging experiences thus\nfar. From here, we went through a job reduction exercise. My department lost one third of its workforce. I was part of the small management team that orchestrated this.\nFrom Uni path,I joined Lever in October1998 as a European Packaging Development Manager. My responsibility now is\nfor all the packaging for Fabrics tablets (e.g. Persil and Surf in\nthe UK) for the whole of Europe. I travel regularly to work with our European factories, suppliers and marketing teams to ensure our packaging runs well in the factories, is cost\neffective and yet meets marketing' s requirements. Unilever takes very good care of its graduates. It challenges them and develops their knowledge in order to apply it in a business environment. The mentoring system means you get\nadvice from an unbiased source on how to take your career\nin the direction that you want it togo. You will work hard but in return, you get to work for one of the world's most exciting fast moving consumer goods conglomerates. Unilever is a very interesting company to work for. It is\ninvolved in some very competitive markets and there is a real\nbuzz developing strategies to outwit your competition. You have the opportunity to communicate with every level\nthroughout the company. I really enjoy trying to balance up the needs of all my internal customers. It challenges your creativity and you soon get recognised as an 'expert' in\nyour field.\nI think Unilever in the next five years will continue to grow in\ndeveloping countries whilst maintaining a dominant force in\nits ' home' of Europe. The huge success of Persil tablets\ndemonstrates that innovation can still take the market place\nby storm even in areas where the market is assumed to be mature and perhaps, unexciting. If I had to give any words of advice, it would be that your future is in your hands. You have to push for everything you want. Just because you are wined and dined by companies in\nthe final years of university, doesn't mean you have a right to the best jobs. In some ways, that competition starts on your first day... STUART CLARKE\nChemical Engineering 1993 -1997\nAfter finishing my degree in Chem. Eng. at Imperial, I took a rather extended six month holiday to go\ntravelling in Africa and South America. I climbed a few\nmountains, lazed on beaches and learned how\nuncomfortable twelve hour bus journeys could be.\nSince then I have started out on the first year of\nUnilever's graduate training programme, as an\nengineer.\nSo far this has involved project engineering at a margarine factory, where the biggest challenges were\nmost definitely man management and influencing\nothers. Since then I have been marketing Chicken\nTonight. Now the products are far from glamorous but\nthe working culture is great. Aside from the day to day\nwork, there is a host of training courses to choose from,\n\n"

If you are a fresher ICU Cinema is a very cheap alternative\nto the expensive cinemas in\nLondon. It boasts a very\nlarge screen and a fantastic new sound system so now we can hear the films\nas well as see the m.Ok, the films may not be the\nmost recent blockbuster but\noften you can catch the\nfilms that you missed a couple of months ago. Watch this space! Appeal for\nReviewers\nHave you read the reviews\nand thought 'I can do better than that!'? Then prove\nit. Call into the Felix office\non Mo days at 1 : 3 0 pm. See you there!\nAmerican Pie\nSomewhere deep beneath the level of There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber, beneath Porky's, lower even than an aver-age headline in the News of the World or the Sunday Sport, you'll\nfind a whole new definition of \"lowest common denominator\". The\nkind of level where any joke that doesn't involve condoms, breasts,\nerections or sperm simply isn't funny. The kind of level where you'll\nfeel embarrassed simply to be watching the gags being unleashed and scared by the fact that you're laughing at them. The kind of level\nbest typified by groups of spotty fifteen year-olds sitting around and sniggering and it's this level that American Pie taps into. In terms of crudity, American Pie simply is on a whole new level.\nSo it's rubbish then? Well, actually, no. This certainly isn't the kind of\nmovie you'd take your mother to (or your girlfriend for that matter),\nbut nonetheless it has moments of genuine comic brilliance amongst the rapid-fire gags. The premise is simple - a group of four teenagers\nin their final year of HighSchool make a pact to all loose their virginity before they graduate, and promptly set about a variety of misadventures in a series of misguided attempts to get their end away.\nAn average night in the Union you might think, but these guys are sadder, more desperate and more full of lame chat-up lines than\nanyone you might have met at IC - they will, quite literally, do any-thing. I won't give away too many of the jokes, for fear of ruining\nsome of the most inspired (or sick, depending on your point of view)\nmoments, but suffice to say you can't understand the meaning of the\nword\" depraved\" until you've seen a teenager attempt to s hagan apple pie... The problem, however, is that once you've identified the level that the\nmovie's operating on the jokes become phenomenally obvious and frequently you'll find the entire cinema laughing hysterically five minutes before the punchline arrives. Admittedly the quality of the stars\ndoesn'the lp matters much( the cast list peaks out with one of the bit-part girls from Buffy), but you're nonetheless left with a distinct feeling\nthat you could probably have written something not entr i ely dissimilar\ngiven about a week. Consequently American Pie is left sitting out on the shelf amongst the movies labelled \"funny for shock value only\".\nThere's the distinct suggestion that it's a movie best suited to the\nworld of teenagers brought up on overly-censored US TV, rather than\nto a generation of kids reared on a diet of Men Behaving Badly, Bott om and Reeves & Mortimer.\nThe Faculty (video)\nEver had that feeling that everyone\naround you is from a different planet?\nNot difficult to imagine when you are studying at Imperial but the kids at Herrington High weren't just imagining it.\nAfter a few bizarre events, a group of loners, leaders and nerds finally discover that the teachers really are from a different planet and it's up to them to save the world from alien domination. While this film has an imaginative story\nand fantastic (if not gruesome) special\neffects, something just doesn't work. The\nstory isn't developed enough and the\ncharacters are shallow although the\nactors playing them are famous faces.\nWith a clever script from Kevin\nWilliamson( Scream and Scream2) and direction form Robert Rodriguez( Dusk\n'til! Dawn), it's a case of trying to fit too\nmuch into an hour and a half.\nBut hey, that's just my opinion. If you\nhaven't seen this film on the big screen\nalready and you have nothing else to do this evening the go and rent it. It's guaranteed to make you laugh and squirm.\nHelen Not bad, just a little depressing.\nDave "

Yeah, right...\nTasting Notes\nWeek Two : The Frying Pan\nThe Basic Skill\nFrying\nLast week, we looked at boiling, the\nsimplest skill of all. This week, things\nget a little more complex, as we switch to the frying pan. Frying is a cornerstone of British cuisine. Traditionally huge amounts of oil were\nused. Frying in a pan was just a less\nfat-intensive version of deep frying.\nAs we became more health conscious, there has been a tendency to\nreduce the amount of fat used in\ncooking. This doesn't mean that the\nfrying pan has had its day. Frying is\nconvenient, and because you can see the food it's hard to go wrong.\nTo fry, you always need some kind of fat. Aside from flavour, the\nmost important characteristic of a cooking fat is smoking point. This is\nthe temperature at which the fat\nstarts to burn, producing smoke. In\ngeneral, if you reach smoking point\nthe temperature is too high.\nWhen frying, all the same heat\ncontrol rules apply as for boiling.\nYou need to heat more vigorously\nwhen the pan and its contents are\nbeing raised in temperature, and less when you only need to maintain\ntemperature. The pan and fat should be raised in temperature,\nbefore the food is added. When fry-ing, you should normally maintain a brisk sizzle. If juice is leaking out of\nthe food, the temperature maybe too low. Splattering probably means\nyou need to reduce temperature.\nMost meat can be fried in its\nown fat, or maybe with a little butter\nor olive oil. It is obvious with a quick\nfork prod whether it is cooked through. Experimentation is the best\nway to learn, but be aware that\nthicker bits of meat are more tricky.\nMeal Suggestion\nSaute Potatoes\nThis is easy, but not quick. It makes\na really tasty lunch, or light meal.\nYou really need to use waxy pot a toes, as opposed to the usual floury\ntypes. Sometimes called salad pot a toes, waxy potatoes have a creamy\ntexture. Common varieties include\nCharlotte and Ratte. Most new potato varieties also seem to be alright\nhere, including the really cheep\nones, of unspecified variety, which\nmost supermarkets sell loose.\nPrepare a medium onion by\nchopping into fairly small bits. Heat\na splash of olive oil and a knob of\nbutter gently in a frying pan, and add the onion. Fry slowly for a few\nminutes, until the onion is soft, but\nnot brown. Chop about 1 5 0 g of\npotato per person into slices of\nabout half a centimetre thick, then\nturn the heat up slightly and add to\nthe pan. Sprinkle a teaspoon of a robust herb (such as Rosemary or Thyme) over the mixture, then stir.\nTurn the heat down so that you can hear only the tiniest sound of fry-ing, then leave for the best part of an hour. If possible, try to cover the\npan. When you return, add some\nchopped cheese, ideally something\nmore adventurous than just ched-dar. Wait for a couple of minutes\nwhile the cheese melts, then serve\nAdvanced Tip\nGlazed Vegetable Chips\nFried vegetable chips are very interesting visually. I use a combination\nof carrot with about half the quantity of parsnip. Chop the vegetables\ninto really thin strips, perhaps only a few millimetres thick. Heat a pan of\nwater, and blanch the vegetables for\na few minutes. You may need to do this in small batches, to ensure that\nthe temperature of the water doesn't drop too low. Fish the vegetables out\nwith a slotted spoon, and dry them\noff by heating briefly on their own in\na frying pan. This ensures that they\nfry easily.\nTurn the vegetables out of the\npan, and heat enough nut oil to\ncoat them. Add the vegetables back\nin, with about half a tablespoon per\nperson of de mer ara sugar. Fry moderately hard for about 1 0 minutes.\nBy the end of this time, the parsnips\nshould be fairly brown, and the carrot just slightly black.\nTake the pan off the heat, add a lump of butter, then serve beside\na main dish.\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n\"Vital\" Ericsson phone deal on the line\nANDREW OF ORI The vastly improved communication network expected at the beginning of this new year has become the latest victim of College bureaucracy. Prolonged contractual negotiations have held up the installation of Ericsson's new system which is set to replace and add new telephone lines all over College. Some have taken the delay as an ominous sign in\nthe wake of Ericsson's controversial deal with St Andrew's. Work was finished four months late at the Scottish University and the completion was greeted by a flood of complaints about the havoc caused by workmen. In response to the general unrest Ericsson changed the University' s lines to0870 numbers which had previously belonged to Chat& Date lines. According to a report released by St Andrew's Student Union, confusion caused by Ericsson's subsequent marke ting campaign explaining the change led to some interesting\ncalls between unsuspecting pa rents and chat operators offering\ndisturbingly dubious services.\nSt Andrew's Union have been left fuming. They claim that Ericss on have inflated their rates in\norder to make a profit out of the un feasibly low bid they originally tendered to the University and have mono polis ed the services\noffered on the lines, banning all charge card numbers. The phone company further endeared them selves by charging a \u00a3 1 0 fee for the privilege of having a working phone which could receive all incoming calls and apparently refusing to publish their rates,\nwhich range from8 p to16p for a call to an Ericsson phone, their\n\" normal\" rate.\n\" Most of the problems at St.\nAndrew's should not arise here\"\nsaidan optimistic Ian Clifford, ICU Deputy President for Finance and Services. St Andrew's were the first University Ericsson dealt with and the DP(F&S) felt a great deal of their problems stemmed from a lack of consultation. There is little danger of Imperial making the same mistake: the Union, Estates, IT, Residences and Communications have all had an input\ninto the deal which is being run as a private finance initiative. Stu dents can expect a decrease in\nthe cost of their outgoing calls, but although the cost of installation is being sub sidi sed by the College the package will still\nhave a capital cost of \u00a3 6 0 per student, \u00a3 4 0 of which will be added on to annual rent bills.\n1 0 Mb internet connections will be available in each room for a fee of \u00a3 1 0 and there are even plans to develop an Ericsson mobile phone deal for IC stud ents. UCL Researchers place Ecstasy on special offer\nSUNIL RAO If you're a healthy adult male, here\ncould be your chance to take part\nin a study investigating the long-,\nterm effects of MDMA, the drug better known as ecstasy.\nResearch is being carried out at\nthe Clinical Health Psychology sub-department of the UCL Psychology\ndepartment into the effects of this\nmassively popular substance on the\ntypical taker - young, fit, healthy\nadult males in abid to assess\nexactly how much risk to human life\nregular use of this semi-synthetic\ncompound poses. Though this certainly isn't the first ever study of the\neffects of this drug, it certainly\nappears to be the first to get widespread coverage and publicity in\nthe popular press.\nMDMA(3,4 Methylene Di oxy N Methyl Amphetamine) isn'ta new\ndrug, having been patented by\nGerman drug company Merck in\n1 9 1 3 as an appetite suppressant,\nthough the patent was allowed to\nlapse. The drug was legitimately\nused as a therapeutic aid by a number of psychiatrists to break\ndown barriers to communication, before animal studies revealed its\npotential ill-effects - in particular\nbiochemical evidence of terminal\ndamage to brain tissue. Since the banning of the drug, research into\nits effects has naturally diminished, and as a result, very little is known about the long term effects of\nMDMA. Consequently, if you are healthy and fit and: \u2022 Used to take ecstasy regularly but\nhave not used it for over a year,\n\u2022 Have been taking it at least twice\na month on average for a year, or \u2022 Take other drugs but have never\ntried ecstasy,\nyou are invited to get in touch with Suzanne L Verheyden by cal ling her at 0 2 0 7 5 0 4 5 9 9 3 , faxing\nher at 0 2 0 7 9 1 6 1 9 8 9 or via email at s. ver hey den@ ucl.a c.uk. As Ms Ver hey den told Time Out maga zine, the study will attempt to determine if, among other things, ecstasy causes permanent damage to the brain.\nWhen Felix attempted to con tact Ms Ver hey den, our reporter\nwas informed that a test was act u ally in progress at the time. All expenses of volunteers are to be paid, all information volunteered is\nto be completely c on fide nti a l,and those who take part will be entitled\nto receive a copy of the results.\n\n"

Some of you\nmight remember the\nalmighty r'n' b column\nTha' Bomb brought to\nyou by everyone's favourite loudmouth,\nMilen. This column and\nothers on rock and jazz\nwill hopefully be launching soon in a bi-weekly\nor monthly format. Any\nprospective columnists\nor reviewers should\ndrop into the Felix office\nand ask for James or\nJoel. See you soon, and\nmake sure you have a good one.\nLeftfield\nRhythm & Stealth\n(Hard Hands/Sony)\nAlthough this album came out a few weeks ago, due to the large\namount of fuss surrounding it's release I thought to leave a comment\nout of this bumper review section would be more than unfair. What the\nfuss was about was simple; Leftfield's first album Leftism was one of\nonly a few albums to truly cross the dance and chart music genres to\ngive a sound that was instantly accessible to both sides. From the\nopening sub aqua echoes of Re/ease the Pressure to the stunning beats\nat the finale of 21st Century Poem, Leftfield partners Neil Barnes and\nPaul Daley never put a foot wrong. The job for Rhythm and Stealth was\nto keep up the same standard. So did the boys do the job? Well not\nquite, but they came very close.\nFrom the album starter Dusted it is clear that Leftfield have decided that\nthe dance floor sound is not the be all and end all of music making,\nand thus on first listening Rhythm & Stealth appears to be not quite all\nit should be. However as the listening experience is repeated, Leftfield's change of tack turns out to be less of an error than it at first seems.\nIndeed Rhythm & Stealth turns out to be the perfect partner to Leftism\nfor an evenings music listening. After the opening downbeat, hip-hop py Dusted, R&S steps up a tempo or three to the unmistakable\nbeats of Phat Planet kick in. Like Open Up from Leftism, Phat Planet\nprovides a sound unheard of anywhere before and this is Leftfield at\ntheir best. The rest of the album, however, doesn't quite cut it when it\ncomes to originality, and that is the main difference between this and\nLeftism.\nAnother question remi a ning over Rhythm and Stealth is that perhaps\nonly three of the tracks are suitable for the dancefloor and some\nheavy remixing is going to be required if we're going to be bopping to\nLeftfield over the next few months. I'm sure though that this can't be\ntoo hard a task for two lads clearly capable of electronic wizardry more\nmasterful that any of the other in the chasing pack.\nRhythm and Stealth thus is unquestionably an album you must own. It's not quite Leftism, but it's better than any other dance album to come\nout for some time. And that includes the Chemicals equally hyped Surrender. Let lus hous Leftfield lay it in on you.\nLive\nThe Distance to Here\n(Radioactive)\nThere's a style of music called Adult Orientated Rock or A. O.R. for short. It's a complete misnomer because (well to me\nanyway, juvenile that I am) whenever I hear the letters A. O.R.I think Eunuch's rock music: music that lacks balls for\npeople in their new flannel shirts, white\ntrainers and crisply pressed jeans with\nturn ups, looking for some sounds with\nan edge. If you take the time to investigate this lame-sounding genre you'll find\nthat there are some decent bands\namongst the pap that invariably gets\nthrown up when some pony-tailed record\nexecutive invents himself a reason for a pay rise. Counting Crows, Matchbox 2 0\nand Live are in this creditable minority.\nThe Distance To Here is the latest offering from the latter of the three, and very\ngood it is too. The distinctive husky voice\nof Ed Kowalczyk adds a certain raw quality to an otherwise perfectly produced\nalbum. Live seem to be moving in a heavier direction, albeit not that different\nfrom what we'd expect from them. There's more bass on The Distance..., the guitars\nare a little bit more over driven and the\nvocals are a tad darker. That said, this is\nstill unmistakably Live and on the first listen you might think that the music just the\nsame as before. But this is an album that\ndeserves another listen, then another and\nanother. In fact, the more it gets an air-ing, the more appreciated it'll become.\nID James Christian\n\n"

Beth's voice finds perfect company in the beats that are\nadded to her near perfect vocal track. The Spiritual Life remix is the\nstandout and featured heavily in\nmany dj charts and on many dance floors over the summer. If you miss\nout on Beth Orton, you're definitely\nmissing out.\n\u2022\nEddy Ram ich Zagreb Cuts Volume1 EP\n(Solid State of House)\n8 / 1 1 / 9 9\nWith Croatia being more famous for\nwar than house tunes, one probably shouldn't expect much from Croat national Eddy Ram ich. Any reservations are blown away by the four\ntunes of Zagreb Cuts. The tunes are\nworld class with good variations\nacross the board, to give a sound that will appeal to its house music\ntarget and many others besides.\nID\n(\u2022Hi\nlp \u00a7 E Chemical Brothers\nOut of Control( Virgin)\nThe Chemicals really\ndo knowhow to make records. I was aHead start at Turmills the\nother week and when this came on all I could do was jump up and down like a madman. Crazy tunes, crazy\ntimes. Anyway Out of\nControl is a col labor ation with Bernard Sum ner and its speedy\nbeats and catchy vocal 'out of control' chorus\nchant are enough to\nget enough the most\ntired club ber bobbing their head. Bring in on brother!\nID\nJon Spencer Blues\nExplosion\nHeavy\n(Mute)\nOnly Jon Spencer can make music like Jon Spencer. However, as\nthis time the release is\na remix Heavy doesn't quite sound like Jon Spencer. The tune\nbounces along with\nsome well timed, well\nthought out scratch\nsamples and the tracks\non the EP prove to be worth more than just a brief listening. Indeed\nthe sound is so co lou rful you'll have more than just the blues\npumping on your\nstereo.\nThe All Seeing I The First Man in Space( London)\nOh dear, it seems that the All Seeing I are going to be the one hit\nwonders we never thought they'd be. The First Man in Space is a world away from the catchy And The Beat Goes On and this is more than a shame. The other tracks on the single aren't up to much either -so I'm afraid this release will be\nfiled in the dustbin.\nIDDDD\nMoby Why does my heart feel so bad?( Mute)\nPerfect comedown records are few\nand far between these days. I 've\nbeen looking for a new tune for\nsome time. Moby, who has\nchanged sound more often than\nanyone is dance music was perhaps the person I least expected to\nproduce such a classic. Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad is an instant\ntimeless classic. The pianos, strings\nand beats are perfect, and the\nvocals from a strong male lead and an angelic female backing all bring\nyou up from whatever fat homo us depths you may wallow. You must\n. own this record. Three Stars\n(Milk n2 Sugars)\nA good quality single\nwith excellent beats\nand sounds that are as\nwell produced as anything you can hear.\nThe tunes however,\ndon't quite cut it as\nwith best at the\nmoment, but only having the super tunes is\nnot what club music is\nabout. Good for a warm up, or a comedown. \u2022ar' "

While I can\nsee the mild attraction\nof the first pastime, I'd have rather cashed in\non being one of the\nRunners earlier than\nKevin has here, on this\nan album of specially\nselected cover versions.\nKevin's also taken up\ncross dress in ng, and\na quire da good skill of\nchatting absolute shite.\nApparently Kev made\nthis album because he\nhad to. All the ugliness\nin the world really took\nits toll on Kev, and it\nwas only the beauty of\nthe songs he has covered on this album that\nbrought him back from\nthe cold.\nWhat? Moving from\ncocaine to cross dressing and from beggar y to mouth farting does\nnot sound like a move\nin the right direction to\nme. Indeed Kevin, you\ndaydream believer you,\nI think you're just a bit\nof a wally.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 James\nDavid Bowie\nHours\n(Virgin)\nAfter dabbling in dance and other areas , Mr. Bowie has returned to\na style much more similar to his earlier self. It seems he has tired of\nhis continuous reinvent io in in the front of the worlds media.\nTitles such as \"Survive\", \"The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell\" and\n\"What's Really Happening\" don't suggest a Steps view on life. However, the album isn'ta gloom fest - rather an accept ion of all that has\ngone before and a determination to make the future better.\nWith its combination of rockabilly riffs and electronic beats \"If I'm Dreaming My Life\" he questions the very existance of a previous relationship - \"was she ever really there at all?\". All his practised years as\na performer come to the surface, with many uses of the tried (or should\nthat be tired?) and tested \"Build it up, Knock it Down\" tempo. The lyrics\nof \"Seven\" are only slightly brighter than the film of the same name.\n\"Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die\". The theme of introspection occurs again and again in the album. \"The Pretty Things are\nGoing To Hell\" is uns uprising ly raw and shout y. Mid 80's soft rock like\nin its production/with plenty of squealing guitar solos, this is one of the\nhig lights of the album.\n\"New Angels of Promise\" darts between Chinese sounding flutes and\nmodern rock, with a smattering of electronica thrown in for good\nmeasure. The clarity of Bowies voice continues to show up lesser vocal-is ts, he manages to tread the thin line between tone fullness and\ntediousness with pr act is ced skill.\nHowever, for all his vocal talent, even if he is an icon of the Twentyth\ncentury, for all his production skills, this album fails to convince. Maybe\nits because he's not an angry young man, or that hes not short of a bob or two but he just doesn't feel very relevant.\nThis album feels like a bit of a purge, a bit of (admittedly very ex pen sive) therapy for some past relationship. But do you really want to buy\nan album like that?\nJohn Digweed\nBedrock Mix\n(Virgin)\nAt a guess I'd say about sixty per cent of\nthe students at this college own a John\nDigweed track. Hidden on the ridiculously popular Trainspotting soundtrack,\nis an absolute storm er of a track called\nFor What You Dream Of. Written under\nhis music-making pseudonym Bedrock\nthis is John Digweed at his finest.\nHowever making music is not only the\nonly skill Mr Digweed has at his disp os al. He's also one of the biggest name dj's on the circuit and with his own club night also called Bedrock John Digweed is not\na man to be ignored! Next week also\nsees the man take the decks at the first\nbirthday celebration of the Bedrock club\nat Heaven\nSo where does that leave us with this mix\nthen? Well much like Digweed's recent\nHeaven Scent single that sound of the\nmix moves from house to trance and\nback again with seamless ease as the\nwell-mixed tunes ebb and flow under the\ncontrol of the master. There's tunes from\nHeller & Farley, Interstate, Morel as well\nas the aforementioned which concludes\nthe mix in a way that no other track could\nachieve. Unmissable, this is the club\nmusic that always pleases.\n\u2022 James\nDigweed plays with Sasha and Danny\nHowells at this Thursday's Bedrock 1st Birthday party at Heaven.\nTickets are \u00a38.\nJoel\n\n"

    "content": "11 October 1999 \u2022 Felix Games\nreact (g) Intro\nWelcome to this first edi tion of the new Felix\ngames section. With a completely new, dedicated and enthusiastic reviewing\nteam we will have fair, balanced reviews of all the\nnewest games. Well, that's the plan anyway.\nThis week we have news of two upcoming console innovations - the Pokemon craze and the much hyped( and delayed) Sega Dreamcast. Personally, as a diehard PC games f an,I'm very\ncynical about all the hype\nsurrounding the Dream cast. Console games designers have had huge amounts of computing power on their hands for\nyears p nd in all that time I have yet to see them produce a game that doesn't feel like it was designed for twelve year olds. But then maybe that's just me. Ben\n(Andy - yeah its just you.\nAn entire console/internet\npackage for just \u00a3199?\nTry finding PC value like\nthat!)\nDreamcast finally hits the streets\nThe gaming world takes a nun retractable step forwards this month with the launch of the first 128-bit console, Sega's Dreamcast. Yep, things have come along way since the pioneering years of the 4 8 k Spectrum, a computer that no doubt brings\nback fond memories for many. No longer do we have to wait 5 minutes for a game to load, nor are we confined to\n2 D and 1 6 colours. Despite these limitations the Spectrum oozed originality, play ability and class, and its longevity\n(over a decade) is testament to these qualities plus the huge software library that was available. Today's technology is\nadvancing faster than ever so such a lengthy lifetime is no longer likely. If the Dreamcast is to flourish it must at least\nmatch the originality of the Spectrum and convince games publishers that it deserves similar software support. One need only compare the Playstation to the N64 to see that such strategies win. Sony capitalised on marketing and a wealth of games while Nintendo, who produced the far superior machine, relied on fewer but better quality games and subsequently did not manage to capture the market majority. The Dreamcast does have an extra trump card up its sleeve, that of Internet access and the potential '6 billion' other players to compete against. The inclusion of a modem in the console is great news for gamers and will revolution is e online gaming, making it available to all.\nSega's propaganda must ensure that the Internet capability of the Dreamcast is well marketed to win over gamers, since they only have a year before the next generation Sony and Nintendo machines are due. Unless wowed early\non, it is likely that many will make do with their ageing Playstation or N64 for another year. Never forget Microsoft, rumour has it that they will continue their megalomaniac expansion into the computing world with the release of their\nown console, the pants named' X box' at the end of next year...\nGraphics are usually a defining factor in game standard, although they are no longer the be-all and end-all.\nGamers can now hope for stronger emotional immersion with games such as Half-Life scaring the hell out of players\nof all ages. As the average game rage has increased to the mid 20's and the old image of games4 geeks is\nshrugged off we can also hope for a broader range of older audience, media incensing material.\nFo r now though, the best we Can do is go out and buy a Dreamcast or, if you're loaded and prepared for hardware problems, a top dog PC. With all the developments in the air you may easily neglect Sega's latest incarnation, but\nthis would be a mistake as the Dreamcast really is a monster, and here are 1 0 reasons why:\n\u2022 Costs the same as a decent PC graphics card - but you get the whole machine without compatibility hassles.\n\u2022 All-inclusive Modem. \u2022 The first 1 2 8 bit console, with unparalleled graphics. \u2022 Weird controller with LCD( Visual memory s ys tem) screen.\n\u2022 Games look similar to PC prices if you shop around. \u2022 1 7 games at launch with many more on the\nway\n\u2022 Boast about having a more powerful system\nthan your mates.\n\u2022 Multi-player finally comes of age Internet\ngaming available to all. \u2022 5 email addresses plus an internet browser\n\u2022 Prevent Sony/ Nintendo domination greater\ncompetition is better for the consumer.\nAndy Got a Dreamcast and want to write game reviews? Then get along to Fe/ix!\n\n"

    "content": "Union Felix \u2022 11 October 1999\nRCS Union\nIn our continuing trip around IC's four faculty unions it's the turn of the Royal College of Science\nUnion, led by their President, Will Bentley, to explain just who they are and what they do.\nT he Royal College of Science is\none of the four constituent\ncolleges that makeup Imperial. Its Union satisfies the needs, surprisingly enough, of scientists in\nImperial College that is Biologists, Biochemists, Physicists and, of course, Mathematicians( in clu d ing Joint Maths and Computing). As this is being written, we find\nourselves in the middle of a very\nbusy week! Months of planning are\nstarting to pay off with a very successful and enjoyable start to Freshers week, both for the Freshers and the rest of us. It started on Monday with a\" quiet\" get together\nof all the new entrants for the first,\nand( judging by its success) definitely not the last, Freshers Barbe cue - free food and a chance to\nchat informally to their new officers. J ez made her usual eye catching appearance and even Theta was present. Meanwhile, out\namongst the crowd, Union officers\nwere discussing the RCS U's role,\npicking up ideas and suggestions\nfor future events and generally helping them to relax on what is for\nmost a stressful day. The Freshers\nEdition of BroadSheet, the Royal\nCollege of Science's newspaper and the oldest C CU newspaper,\nalso went out. Under a new editor,\nthe BroadSheet has been revamped, with topical news, stories and analysis - with a particular\nslant towards science. As an added incentive to pick up a copy, on the\nback is a prize crossword with a \u00a310 book token going to the win ner. BroadSheet welcomes articles\nfrom all members of the RCS. Of course we realise that\nafter Freshers week things can go a bit flat, and so events have\nbeen organised throughout this term. Future high\nlights include the Freshers Barnight,\nwhere there will\nbe pub games, officers ready for\nan informal chat\nand the chance to take on either\nof our two yards\n(the Raimes Yard1.5 pints - or the Theta Yardpints). C come. Ongoing throughout this term,\nthe Freshers Departmental Dinners\nare taking place. These are four\ndinner roughly one per depart ment - where you can meet\nother students from your department and enjoy a great dinner at the\nsametime. Queen's Rules\napply, dress is\nblack tie and there will be speeches as well - everything\nyou' d expect from a proper formal dinner. It is also an opportunity> chat in for vith\nyes, and the beer is\nFREE. Not that that would make any difference to you coming or not. Also coming up is the Freshers\nPaintball. Paintball is great fun any-way, but with the added rivalries\nbetween our departments the matches become really exciting -you' d be surprised how many pe ople want to inflict revenge on mathematicians for all the trouble maths\nhas caused them. It should be noted that although these are classified as \"Freshers events\", people from other years are warmly wc ln ion officers and see the lighter side of academic staff\nwho maybe there. Heavy subsidy\nfrom departments means that the\nprices are surprisingly low.\nThe RCS has its own clubs as well, most famously the RCS Motor Club which looks after Jezebel, the\nofficial transport of the president\nand one of our mascots. Jezebel is\nan inviolate mascot and therefore\nis not allowed to be \" borrowed\" by\nother unions. We do however have\na violate mascot, Theta the Thermometer, which can be\" bor3n d rowed\", although this has never\nhappened, thanks to careful protection. The R CSU has an enviable\nrecord in mascot ry for example last year we lifted Sedrik the Safe\nfrom City & Guilds. Other clubs\ninclude AstroS oc, Departmental Societies and sports clubs, such as\nRCS Cricket, Rugby and, the newly\nformed, RCS FootballClub, which is entering UL U league this year for\nthe first time.\nOn a more serious note, we provide a welfare and academic support system. Through depart ment representatives (dep-reps) we can monitor what is going on in the\nlives of our members and help\nthem out when they need it. If\nsomeone is in trouble they need only contact their de prep or the Academic Affairs Officer and we will do our best to sort things out.\nWe are also always open to suggestion on how to improve the\nUnion, to make it the best possible\nservice to the scientists at Imperial.\nAll that remains to say is that I hope people will make use of all\nthat is on offer. Take the op port uni ties: go out and meet people, make friends, have a good time.\nAnd all the while remember that\nthere is help available whatever\nthe problem. There are people who are prepared to help with pretty\nmuch anything. Any organisation is\nonly as good as the people within it\n- and with over 2 5 0 0 people in the\nRCS, we must be good for some thing!\nForthcoming Events\nForthcoming Events\nTuesday12 th October12:30 pm Freshers General Meeting( Reed Lecture Theatre, Sherfield Level 4)\n7 : 0 0 pm Freshers Bar Night( Union Bar)\nMonday18 th October6:00 pm Gen Com Tuesday19 th October7:00 pm Life Sciences Freshers Dinner Thursday21 st October7:00 pm Mathematics Freshers Dinner\nMonday25 th October7:00 pm Physics Freshers Dinner Thursday28 th October7:00 pm Chemistry Freshers' Dinner Saturday13 th November Paintball - \u00a3 2 2 + Ammo( about \u00a320).

You used to play nicely together when\nyou were little, but lately he has become mean. He sees you as his\nrival because you are the same age and height. When you hear\nthat Professor Oak is a Pokemon expert, you get excited because\nyou are a curious boy. You walk outside of Pallet Town in search of\nPokemon and you hear a voice.\n\"Hey! Don't go into the grass!\" It's Professor Oak. \"There are wild\nPokemon living in there,\" he says. \"They can be very dangerous. If\nyou possess trained Pokemon, you can let them fight against wild\nFrom this outset this is obviously aimed at young kids, but don't let\nthat put you off. This little sucker is infuriatingly addictive. It's all\ntoo easy to lose a couple of hours. So if you want to get good\nmarks this year it's best to steer clear. The graphics were never\ngoing to be impressive considering this is probably the oldest console still in production, but the designers have managed to cram in\nas uprising amount of detail. If you play on one of the new Game Boy Colors or even ick ler Game Boy Pockets the graphics look\neven sharper, thanks to the better screen.\nThe really, really clever marketing ploy of this game is the fact that\nit comes in two versions, a Red and a Blue cartridge. In order to\nbecome a true master Pokemon trainer you have to enlist the help\nof a friend with a copy of the other colour game.\nBy entering your Pokemon into many battles you can make them\ngrow in strength and ability. Also at certain points in the game,\nyour Pokemon will evolve into new Pokemon, with new abilities.\nDeath does not exist in the Pokemon world - you merely beat opponents if your Pokemon take too much damage they pass out -ready to be re-charged by their trainer.\nI really found this game very hard to put down. While it was a little\nchildish at times, it was sweet instead of annoying and all the monsters are very well designed with memorably wie rd names. While\nthe RPG sections are simplistic, there is enough variety to keep you\ngoing and a wo d ge of that \"just one more battle\" feeling.\nWhy not get a piece of the Pokemon pie while its still fresh?\nJoe!\n\n"
