    "content": "C LETTERS Z_^ Letters\nThe Cuts\u2014\nMore\nWhining!\nDear Sir,\nFollowing last week's article by Steve Lane\nof the IC Caving Club, I should also like to\nexpress my concern over the proposed cuts in\nthe transport subsidies for RC C Clubs. In\ngeneral the term time activities of our club\nculminate in a 'tour' in each vacation. The\npurpose of this tour is to put into practice\ntechniques which have been introduced over\nthe previous three months and to build on\nthese. The extended time period of the tour is\na more efficient way of increasing\ncompetence with in the club and to pass on\nexperience from older members to those who\nhave just joined. The alternative is the\nintensive weekend trip which only allows two\ndays to attempt anything new, before having\nto return to London. Whilst the weekends\ngive an excellent opportunity for club\nmembers to sample many of the different\nareas in Britain, each developing particular\nstyles of walking or climbing, there may be a gap of months even a complete academic year\nbefore the club returns to each area when\nvaguely remembered methods must be\nre learnt wasting valuable time. The value of\nweek long tours to clubs such as ours, caving,\nmountaineering, and canoeing is\nin measurable. Techniques can be perfected\nover several days. Once persevered with, they\nare much less likely to be forgotten. At the\nend of the year the summer tour is the\nhighlight of the year's activities, when\nmembers can enter an environment abroad\nwhich many would not otherwise be able to\nafford. This offers challenges far more\nstimulating than anything found in Britain.\nThe results are a dramatic increase in the\nstandards in the club and inevitably in the\nsafety standards self-imposed by club\nmembers who have gained such experience\nand confidence over the three weeks abroad.\nWhy then should reducing the tour\nfunding be the solution of the Union's problems since it attacks only specific clubs.\nObviously it is impossible for our club to\nexperience lightweight walking activities\nwithout leaving London. We need our tours\nto fulfil all that we can offer to\nundergraduates and postgraduates at this\nCollege. Let the cuts be administered,\nthrough RC C, by the people who are best\ncapable of deciding where the cuts should be\nmade, distributing the effects more equitably.\nCelia Woodward\nChairman 1985-86\nIC Scout and Guide Club\nG Thorpe\u2014\nThe Real\nProblem\nDear Sir,\nI was interested to read G Thorpe's letter\nof last week (31 May) where he/she was\nobviously keen to 'solve the real problems of\nthe world'.\nAny solution relies heavily on the problem\nbeing correctly identified, and at its root this\nlies with man himself. Attempts to change the\nworld without changing human nature will at\nbest merely be treating the symptoms rather\nthan effecting a cure. In this context the\nbiblical view of Man as created in the human\nimage of God, but fallen and fatally flawed, is\na key insight into understanding the human\ncondition.\nIn a nutshell, I am part of the problem, but\nGod's transforming power is part of the\nanswer.\nYours,\nMartin Lings\n(Soil Mechanics PG)\nNOS on\noperating system\nDear Sir,\nOn 24 May you reported that the ICCC\npassword file had been broken into, and that\nusers were recommended to change their\npasswords. On a proper operating system,\nthere would be no problem, one could simply\ntype, at a terminal, password, Gandalf or\nsuch, and that would be the new password\nfrom then on. Under NOS (not an Operating\nSystem) it's not so simple. One must\n1 Go to the Computer Centre and obtain\nthe correct form.\n2 Fill this in and present it to your\ndepartment computing representative (not\nsomeone you are likely to know) rather than\nthe group representative who deals with unit\nallocation, etc.\n3 Return the form to ICCC, who will have\nyour new password up in a day or two._While this situation remains, security at ICCC is a joke\u2014just like screen editing and a lot of\nother things that NOS can't do. If this is a Cente of Excellence, when are we going to get\nthe excellent operating system we deserve?\nDiane Love\nPhysics PG\nFELIX\nThe student grant goes up 3% next year.\nRents are likely to go up 5%. When the new\nhousing benefit regulations are announced\nthey will probably abolish benefit for\nstudents. The rates will be reduced, in any\nevent. The Government are also likely to\nabolish Supplementary Benefit for students\nduring the summer vacation.\nStudents next year are going to be short of\nmoney. Students in London next year are\ngoing to be virtually destitute.\nThe Government realise this, of course,\nand, of course, it is exactly what they want.\nThey are forcing students to live in\ncircumstances under which they cannot\nsurvive without taking out a loan. There was\na massive outcry when the Government first\nspoke of student loans. Now that they are\nconspiring to introduce them through the\nback door, the outcry should be no less.\nUnfortunately there is no hope that the\nGovernment will listen, though.\nIf you take 300 madmen and send them\nabroad with brightly coloured scarves and\nbottles of Newcastle Brown Ale then they are\nclassed as football hooligans. If you put 300\nmadmen in a palace in Westminster they are\nable, not only to do irreparable damage to\nour country's name, but also to its future.\nThe wages of the sin of these philistine anti-scholars is the intellectual death of the\ncountry.\nNext year's editor has asked me to\nannounce that publicity to be printed for\nFreshers' Fair should be submitted to him\nbefore Wednesday 7 August. The Print Unit\ncannot guarantee that orders placed after this\ndate will be printed in time. Orders placed\nbefore the end of term will be charged at this\nyear's rates.\nThere will be no FELIX next week\u2014the\nlast issue will appear on Wednesday 19 June.\nThe copy deadline is Wednesday 12 June for\nDiary and Small Ads.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Michael\nArthur, Grenville, Chris Martin, Martin,\nRichard, Diane, Nigel, Pete, Debbie, Tinker,\nIan, Alan, Judith, Sarah, Pete, Rosemary and\nTony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

    "content": "Getting down to business\nGetting down to business\nAfter the relatively easy job of acquiring a handful of addresses comes the rather more\ndifficult one of converting them into bricks\nand mortar.\nEven if you have been discerning in the\naddresses that you have taken down,\nchances are that a large proportion of them\nwill be unless. In most cases this will be\nbecause someone has beaten you to it but\nis also not uncommon to find that the details\nheld by the accommodation agency are\nsomewhat more attractive than the\naccommodation itself. For example, rents\nare sometimes put up once the owner of the\naccommodation realises that there are a lot\nof people interested in it.\nSo, the first thing to do is to reach for your\nbag of five pence s and ring the numbers to\ncheck that the accommodation is still\navailable, find out more about the place and\nfix up an appointment to meet the owner and\nsee the room\nWhen you go to see a place it is important\nto remember that the landlady is looking for a suitable tenant just as much as you are\nlooking for a decent place to live. After a long\nand frustrating day of looking for somewhere\nto live you may not be at your best but it is\nessential to have in mind that the average\nlandlady is looking for someone who is quiet\nand studious and generally likely to occupy\nthe room in a way which causes the least\npossible disruption to the lifestyle of the rest\nof the household.\nThus it is important to appear polite and\npliable even though you may be feeling quite\nthe opposite.\nThere are a number of thing to look out for\nwhen you go to look at a room.\nFurnishings\nIs there room and facilities to work, eg desk,\nchair, etc and somewhere to keep books. If\nthe furnishings are not adequate in some\nrespect will the landlady allow you to\nsupplement them with things of your own. Is\nthe bed going to be comfortable enough to\nsleep in for a year?\nOther facilities\nUsually you will have to share the bathroom\nwith other people. Are there going to be\nunreasonable restrictions on when you can\nuse the facilities? When landladies initially\noffer a room, they are sometimes vague\nabout cooking facilities where this involves\nsharing the family kitchen. It is useful to\nestablish at this stage exactly what use you\nwill be able to make of the kitchen. At the\nsame time, it quite often happens that a landlady starts being fairly unhelpful in this\nrespect but once she gets to know you and\nrealises that you are going to treat the\nfacilities in a responsible way, things intend\nto improve. If you intend to use a bicycle to\nget you to and from College, check whether\nyou will have a place to keep it.\nHeating\nWhen you go and look at a place in\nSeptember, you will be seeing it at its best in\nthat it will be fairly warm because of the\nweather and any dampness is likely to have\ndried out. Try and envisage the place in\nwinter with the wind whistling in through the\ngaps round the window and the innocent\nlooking dry stain marks on the wallpaper in\nfull drip. Rooms in someone's own house are\nmore likely to be weatherproof but in houses\nrun by commer ical landlords who are\ninterested in making as much money out of a place with the least possible expenditure this\nkind of problem is much more likely to occur\nand the same goes for flats. Gaps around\nwindows and under doors can be dealt with\nquite easily by fitting your own draught\nexclude rs, but damp often requires\nexpensive re pointing work or repairs to\nguttering which the owner may never get\nround to doing. Rooms with high ceilings are\ndifficult to keep warm, the more so when\nthey are next to an un lagged roof space.\nIt is an idea to look at the heaters which are\nprovide to see whether they will be able to\nkeep the room warm, and if you are paying\nfor the electricity or gas yourself, how much\nper week this will add to the real cost of the\naccommodation.\nFire Risk and Means of Escape\nLarge houses full of beds its are perhaps\nmore likely to go up in smoke than a lot of\nother sort of accommodation. Such houses\nlike others in multiple occupation, are meant\nto have certain 'means of escape' facilities.\nThese usually involve self-closing doors with\na fireproof backing on them, a fire escape at\nthe top of the house and, in the case of\nhouses over say three stories high, a fire\nescape at the top and a fire screen on the\nstairs, usually near the top of the\nbuilding\u2014this is where you have to go\nthrough a self closing door to get to the stairs\nserving the upper portion of the house. Such\nbuildings are also meant to have a fire\ncertificate. A good way to ensure that you\ndon't get the accommodation is to ask to see\nthe owners fire certificate.\nIt might make life difficult if you were only\nto accept accommodation in houses which\ncomply with the fire regulations, but at the\nsame time do bear in mind the dangers. If you\nare offered a room at the top of a house, what\nwould happen if a fire broke out on the floor\nbelow. Would you be able to get out? Other\ndetails like old wiring or the fact that the\naccommodation is over or next to a chip shop\nare also worth noting in considering whether\nor not the risk of living there is an acceptable\none.\nNoise\nIf you need a quiet environment to work or\nsleep in, look out of for main roads and\nrailway lines. Unfortunately, however, the\nmost likely nuisances are going to be your\nneighbours and there is no way of finding out\nhow noisy they will be until you have moved\nin.\nThe Landlord\nThe landlord's personality, as it were, is not\nthat important in cases where he does not\nlive on the premises, but if you have a resident landlord it can be very important\nindeed. To a large extent it is up to you how\nyou get on with your landlady although of\ncourse there are some unreasonable\nlandlords and landladies who would try the\npatience of a saint. In most cases, though, all\nthat is required is a bit of give and take on\nboth sides, but you may well be expected to\nmake most of the concessions. On a first\nmeeting it is very difficult to work out\nwhether you will get on with a particular\nlandlord or landlady and if they take an\ninstant dislike to you the problem will be\nsolved by you not being offered the room. As\na general rule, the quality of the relationship\nthat you can develop with the landlord will\nhave a considerable effect on the quality of\nyour life in the accommodation.\nTransport\nBefore rejecting a place because it is too\ndifficult to get to on public transport, it is'\nworth looking at alternative means of\ntransport. Don't forget the overground\ntrains that serve South London and you\ncould even consider the possibility of getting\na bicycle. Also it is sometimes quicker to\nwalk than to use public transport!\nMaking a Decision\nOne of the most difficult aspects of the whole\nbusiness is trying to decide whether or not to\ntake a place that isn't quite what you had in\nmind. On the one hand you can't help\nthinking that if you go on looking for a bit\nlonger something better will come your way\nbut on the other hand you may be getting\npretty fed up with trudging around looking at\nplaces and if you don't take up the offer that\nyou have, you may end up having to take a place that is even less suitable.\nIf you are reaching the end of your tether\nand a place comes up that is acceptable but\nnot ideal, one solution is to take it so long as\nyou don't have to enter into a long term\nagreement for it. Then, when things have\nquiet e ned down a bit and you are feeling up\nto rejoining the fray you can start looking\naround for something more suitable without\nthe threat of homelessness hanging over\nyour head.\nFEUX Friday 7 June 1985 11\n\n"

He\ndescribed the hard realities of agricultural\nprice wars. Sugar prices, for example are\nfixed in the US and Europe to protect\nfarmers, while poor Third World countries\nmust sell at well below the cost of\nproduction. For them it may be their only\ncommodity and they are desperate for\nforeign exchange.\nIt is worth making fuel from sugar cane.\nNot for profit, but countries like Brazil prefer\nit to paying valuable dollars for oil. Prof\nRighelato showed that a hard-headed look at\nprices is needed to decide which\nbio technologies might be profitable in this\ncountry, and which would need more\ncompelling justification. Making meat from\ncereals using a cow is highly inefficient, but\nthe price per ton that people will pay is so\nhigh that the process still makes money.\nMaking medical or specialist products is one\nof few ways biotechnological conversions\nthat can make a profit.\nMaking the very sweet high-fructose\nsyrups from maize is big bus in ees in the USA\nbecause of high sugar prices. The same\ncould be true in Europe (the prices are right)\nbut when companies began investing in this\nbiotechnology an EEC ban froze\ndevelopment. As Prof Righelato pointed out,\nindustry may be encouraged by government\npricing but blocked by equally arbitrary\ngovernment laws. (Both in this case protect\nEuropean sugar beet farming).\nIn the early seventies making food from\nmicrobes ('single-cell proteins') seemed like a good idea. The raw materials (Petroleum,\ngas, etc) were cheap, the ferm enters used\nless land than crop fields, and the proteins\nmade had an excellent balance of nutrients.\nThe oil crisis (or rather the OPEC price-hike)\nand denser cropping destroyed many single-cell protein development programmes.\nConsumer conservatism was another\nobstacle. Only a few huge companies could\ncontinue and now ICI and Rank-HovisMcDougall are the lone survivors. Their\nproducts (Pruteen and Mycoprotein) are\nonly now beginning to show their nutritional\nworth. (Look out for Mycoprotein in your\nsuper a market steak and kidney pie).\nProfesor Righelato gave us a picture of the\nforces that sway huge industries: Our\nWestern protectionism, foreign exchanges,\nour eating habits and prejudices, wars and\ncartels, inability to tackle very long term\ninvestments, and sometimes blindness to\nnew technologies. Biotechnology is not\nsimply about making money: the politics and\ninnovation process make it far more\ninteresting than that!\nCLUBSG\nJoint Rag\nCommittee\nWednesday 12 June\n12.30pm Union Lounge\nElection papers\nwill come down\non Monday\nat 5.30pm Academic Affairs\nGeneral\nMonday 17th June\nat 12.30pm Senior Common Room\nAll welcome, but all Dep\nReps (both incoming and\noutgoing) must attend or\nsend apologies to the Union\nOffice\n\u00a330 for\ntwo days' work\nCleaning work\nis available\non Monday 24\nand\nThursday 25 June\nin the residences\nPlease contact Student\nServices for f uther details\nFEUX Friday 7 June 1985\n\n"

    "content": "Wind\nPower\nWind Power is one of the most promising of\nthe renewable energy sources in many parts\nof the world. A team in the Electrical\nEngineering Department headed by Dr Leon\nFreris are working on two interesting\nprojects involving wind energy conversion.\nWind is particularly abundant in the\nUnited Kingdom; with an annual average\nwind speed experienced by the North\nWestern coast of Scotland and the Scottish\nIsles being as high as anywhere in the world.\nBut to exploit this non-polluting and\ninexhaustible energy source it is necessary\nto develop aero generators which convert\nwind energy into electricity as efficiently and\nreliably as possible. With conventional\ndesigns, some major problems have been\nencountered and it is hoped that a new\naero generator under development at\nImperial College will help to solve them.\nOne of the problems is the fatigue\nexperienced by the blade roots due to wind\nturbulence and the shadowing effect of the\ntower over millions of revolutions. The new\ndesign hopes to overcome this cyclic stress\nby having the blades attached to the hub\nthrough an ordinary and cheap universal\njoint. In this way the blades have freedom to\n'cone', that is move out of the plane of\nrotation, thus relieving the blade root from\nthe fatigue experienced by conventional\ndesigns. So that the joints experience a minimum of centrifugal force, the blades are\ncounterbalanced. These universal joints also\nallow blade pitch control, for example the\npossibility of changing the angle of the blade\naero foil with respect to the wind. By\nadjusting the pitch it is possible to control the\npower converted from the wind, and so\nprevent the system from over speeding at\nhigh winds. The pilot system about to be\ntested, is shown in figure one, and has a set of\nblades of 3.8 metres diameter; but ultimately\nthe aero generator will be fitted with blades of\neight metres diameter and will provide a maximum of about ll kW from the\ngenerator. The whole system is under the\nsupervision of a microprocessor based\ncontroller which loads up the wind turbine\noptimal ly to maximise the energy from the\nwind, and also monitors other variables and\ntakes action to protect the system if\nFig 1 above-exploded view\nFig 2 below-what a whopper\nFig 3 top right-close up\nnecessary. This new aero generator will soon\nbe installed at the Rutherford Appleton\nLaboratories in Oxford so that extensive\nstudies on its performance can be carried\nout.\nAnother area of wind energy exploitation\nwhich has enormous potential is in the\ngeneration of electricity in power networks\nsupplied by diesel generator sets. These\nnetworks are found in areas too remote for\nconnection to a national grid or on islands.In\nthese situations the exploitation of wind is\nparticularly attractive as islands often\npossess a high annual average wind speed, and diesel generated electricity is expensive\nparticularly when fuel transportation costs\nare high. When the required wind generation\ncapacity is small in comparison with the\ndiesel installed capacity then addition of wind\ngenerators is not normally a problem.\nHowever, to obtain substantial fuel savings\nsufficient wind capacity is needed to supply\non occasions the total load demand. Then\nsystem stability and control logistics become\na problem.\nDr Freris is involved in a co-operative\nproject supported by the Science and\nEngineering Research Council, and Hawker\nSiddeley Power Plant Ltd which is being\ncarried out at Imperial College and the\nRutherford Appleton Laboratories (RAL) in\nOxford. The main intention is to develop a wind/diesel system which is commercially\nviable. The project involves extensive\nsystem modelling and experimental studies,\nbased on a working system which consists of\na16kWa ero generator and a7 kW diesel\ngenerator. Figure two shows this system\nwhich is based at the RAL site.\nThe work up to date has led to the\nestablishment of ways to minimise diesel fuel\nconsumption, maintain system voltage and\nfrequency as conditions vary, and minimise\nthe wear and tear on the diesel engine.\nProjects such as these that provide\npollution free energy from inexhaustible\nsources are of importance to developed\ncountries but even more so to developing\ncountries as the technology used can be\nreadily adapted to exploit local materials and\nexpertise.\nFEUX Friday 7 June 1985 5\n\n"

    "content": "Signing the\nagreement\nSigning the agreement\nAgreements come in many shapes and sizes but they have one\ncommon objective\u2014to give the property owner as much control over\nthe situation as possible. Housing legislation has two main objectives.\nOne is to give tenants security, the other is to impose some form of\ncontrol over the level of rent that the landlord can charge.\nThese provisions can have serious consequences for landlords and\nso they naturally seek to avoid them.\nIn many cases, this is not entirely un resonable. Landlords have high\noverheads and are operating in an area which is only marginally\nfeasible in commercial terms. The return on the amount of capital\ninvested in the accommodation tends to be low in com Dari son to\nother forms of investment. Much rented accommodation is loan\nfinanced and vulnerable to increases in interest rates, apart from\nabsorbing much of the rent which the landlord is able to extract from\nhis tenants. There is an element of capital gains ie the increasing value\nof the house or flat, but this is fairly unpredictable. If a landlord is\nunable to charge a rent which covers his outgoing s and gives a reasonable profit, and if he is unable to sell and recover his investment\nthen there is not much point in his continuing being a landlord.\nFrom the point of some classes of tenant, such as old people and\nfamilies, security of tenure is extremely important. For a student,\nhowever, this is not so critical. Most students are looking for short\nterm acc com mod ation anyway and the most important thing is to\navoid being made homeless at crucial times like in the middle of\nexams.\nSo, the main thing is not to worry too much about agreements.\nEven though some seem strange, there is usually method in\ntheir madness.\nMinimum Protection\nUnder virtually every kind of accommodation arrangement, there is a level of minimum protection provided by the Protection from Eviction\nAct. The landlord has to give you 28 days written notice and then\nmust apply for a court order before he can get you out. Any attempts\nto get rid of you without following this procedure constitute a criminal\noffence.\nTypes of agreement\nLicences\nThese are the most common form of Rent Act evasion and until a recent House of Lords decision, they seemed to have the unqualified\nsupport of the Courts.\nThe main feature of a licence is that the owner reserves the right to\nmove in with you himself or move other people in as and when he\nlikes. This is just a technical form of words which is intended to\nprevent the creation of a protected tenancy. In reality the owner has\nno intention of doing this. Licences also tend to include clauses to the\neffect that you freely agree to enter into a situation where you have no\nrights. However, in fact he would still have to get a court order if he\nwanted you out.\nHoliday Lets\nThese used to be very common but their validity as a means of taking\nyour rights away has now been discredited for long lets because they\nare obviously sham agreements\u2014who do you know who would take a nine month holiday in Shepherds Bush?\nYou may come across a holiday let but if you do, it probably means\nthat the landlord doesn't know what he is doing. There is no reason\nwhy you shouldn't sign one of these.\nTenancy Agreements\nSigning a tenancy agreement could mean that you are a protected\ntenant, can stay there for as long as you want and have your rent\nregistered (this usually means reduced) by the Rent Officer. These\nagreements are usually used where the landlord wants to incorporate\none of the Rent Act exceptions to long term security of tenure, such\nas the fact that he is an owner occ u pier. This means that al thou oh i \u00ab* >\nare a protected tenant, the court would let the landlord have his\nhouse back, if he wanted to live there himself.\nShorthold Tenancies\nThese were created in an attempt to encourage more people to let\nflats, by restricting security of tenure. However, in order to create\nsuch a tenancy the landlord has to register a fair rent for the,\naccommodation. For this reason they are very unattractive to most j landlords and although you may hear of short hold tenancies it isi\nunlikely that you will ever come across one.\nNon-existent Agreements\nMany landlords don't use agreements at all. This is usually when they\nlive in the same house in which case security of tenure is limited\nanyway. People worry about this kind of arrangement. In fact, there\nisn't anything to worry about. Nearly all agreements have a lot to say\non what the tenant must, or must not do, to fulfill his side of the deal\nand very little to say about what the landlord has to do. If there is not\nan agreement, this does not take away any of your legal protection. In\nthe case of a situation where the landlord is not resident, the absence\nof an agreement is likely to mean that you are a fully protected tenant.\nThe only real snag with this kind of arrangement is that it is often used\nby people who are up to something like subletting when they\nshouldn't be or not declaring the rent to the taxman. Such landlords\nare likely to refuse to give you receipts for rent, insist on cash\npayments and generally try to give the impression to the world at large\nthat you don't exist. The only problem is that if you want to claim any\nform of housing benefit you will find it very difficult to convince the\ntown hall that you are paying rent. Such landlords get emotional if you\nmention housing benefit to them.\nFixed term agreements\nMost agreements are for a fixed term eg 1 October 1985 to 30 June\n1986.\nThis applies to all kinds of tenancies and licences. The problem with\nfixed term agreements is that unless they contain a clause to say that\nyou can move out early-eg by giving a months notice, then you will be\nliable for the rent for the whole period of the agreement. This can\ncause real difficulties if you find that you don't like the place. Usually\nlandlords will let you go if you can find a replacement but this is often\nnot possible .It is important not to sign a fixed term agreement\nwithout provision for giving notice unless you are reasonably\nconfident that you will be happy to stay there for the whole period.\nThe alternative is to negotiate with the landlord and try and get him to\nput in a provision about leaving early.\nChecklist for signing agreement\n1 Read it carefully. Standard clauses like not playing records after\n10.00pm are unlikely to cause any problems. The landlord will only\nenforce these if he starts getting complaints from neighbours etc.\nHowever, sometimes landlords put in clauses saying, for instance,\nthat you will have to pay some enormous sum at the end of the\ntenancy for cleaning or for an inventory check. These are a different\nmatter altogether.\n2 If the agreement is for a fixed period remember that you will only\nbe able to move out before the period expires if the agreement\nexpressly says that you can.\n3 If you are really unhappy about signing an agreement for any\nreason, don't sign it. Ask if you can take it away so that you can get\nsome advice on it. The landlord may refuse to let you have the flat\nunless you sign right away but if he does, then you were probably right\nto be unhappy about the agreement in the first place!\nDeposits\nLandlords usually ask for large deposits to cover damages and nonpayment of rent. Since you are likely to be having to part with one or\ntwo months rent, it is important that you take steps to safeguard it.\nThe problem with deposits is that once the landlord has it, it can be\ndifficult to get it back. This is a very good illustration of the saying that\npossession is nine-tenths of the law. At the end of your stay the\nlandlords may claim, for example, that you have ruined the paintwork\nand that he will keep the deposit because he has to re-decorate. In\nmost cases it is very difficult to disprove this and since the landlord\nhas the money he usually ends up keeping it!\nThere are, however a few things that you can do to avoid this.\nWhen you move in do a careful condition check of the\naccommodation, make notes and send a copy to the landlord. In\nparticular, you need to look out for things which might prove\nexpensive if you are accused of causing them later on. For example\nmarks on walls, shabby paint work, damaged wallpaper and holes,\nstains and cigarette burns in carpets. Also you need to look out for\ndamage to bathroom fittings and kitchen equipment, fitted cupboards\netc. Marked and broken furniture and stained mattresses are also\nworth looking out for. Sometimes the landlord will provide an\ninventory which makes it easier but if he doesn'ta comprehensive list\nof effects, copied and sent to the landlord could well pay dividends\nlater on. One way of recording the general condition of the\naccommodation and the state of decorations is to take photographs.\nColour ones are best because they tend to be unflattering anyway\nwhereas black and white photos have the opposite effect.\n12 Friday 7 June 1985 FEUX\n\n"

This was the first time\nfor several years that a vote has\nbeen necessary at a SRC meeting,\nwhere previously a consensus has\nalways been reached.\nThe proposal accepted also\nallowed for \u00a3100,000 to be taken\nfrom the Residence Account\nreserves, which stand at over\n\u00a3200,000, to go towards the\nexpected \u00a3350,000 bill for work\nin Southside necessary in the next\ntwelve months to comply with\nfire regulations. This work will be\ncarried out whilst students are in\nresidence' and involves fitting\nautomatic door closing devices in\neach room and replacing the\npresent glass partitions on\nstaircases with stronger partitions, as well as work on\ncommunal areas to provide fire\ndoors.\nThe Residence Account reserve is built up from surpluses\ngenerated each year and is\nearmarked as a contribution to\nthe cost of increasing the number\nof residence places, although no\nfirm guarantee that it will only be\nused for this has ever been given\nby College. There is increasing\npressure for it to be used to pay\nfor the soaring costs of major\nmaintenance work on present\nresidences, especially with the\nCollege's reserves being increasingly stretched as further\nGovernment cuts take effect. The\nincrease in rents by 5% will\ngenerate an estimated \u00a356,000\nwhich will be added to the\nreserves, whereas a3% rise in line\nwith the grant increase would\nraise only approximately \u00a333,000.\nThe rises mean an extra \u00a3 1.30 a week on Southside, Linstead and\nWeeks singles, taking them to\n\u00a327.30.

The continued sick apart hied system in\nSouth Africa while College maintains close\nlinks with the oppressive South African\ngovernment.\nThe non-sens ical wars taking place in\nvarious parts of the globe and how the plight\nof the suffering Lebanese, Afghani and Irish\npeople has been ignored.\nThe political questions brought about by\nthe re-election of Regean, and the deaths of\nAndrapov and Mrs Gandhi.\nThe list is by no means complete but\ncompared to the above the most major\nproblem faced by the UK this year, the\nminers strike, seems (and is) insignificant.\nIt could be argued that since S CC contains\nall the religious and political societies it is the\njob of S CC to do something about the above.\nThere were three main S CC co-ordinated\nevents this year (no improvement on last\nyear):\nThe Human Rights Week was very\nsuccessfully organised by Tom Osorio this\nyear and high-lighted some of the problems\nabove, the level of participation was perhaps\ndown on last year but the level of activity was\ncertainly high.\nContact Week organised by the Christian\nsocieties and co-ordinated by Richard\nEccleston was the most visible in a long time\nand several important questions were\ndiscussed.\nThe rest of the religious societies, Baha'i, Islamic and Jewish participated in the\nr?e/gio us Week with the highlight being the\nevent by Baha'i society which brought\ntogether all the major religions which showed\nthat perhaps there isn't as much in common\nbetween them as some would lead (or like) us\nto believe.\nBy far the largest group within S CC( or\nindeed in the College), the Miscellaneous\nsocieties (with the membership of just the\nIndustrial, Sci Fi and HG Wells societies\nexceeding a grand) were content with mostly\nindividual activities but their level of activities\nis very high anyway, a special mention must\nbe made of the careers fair which is\norganised by Industrial Society and was on it\nusual grand scale.\nFinancially, S CC may just be able to keep\nto its budget this year, thanks to fine\nmanagement by Dr Nigel Graham, the HST, Adrian Masters and the HJT. But with the\nmega Union short fall next year and the\nformation of two new societies (Appropriate\nTechnology and a much needed Arts\nAppreciation Society) next year may be a problem. Also I would like to use this\nopportunity to appeal to all those who use\nthe S CC equipment to please return it as\nvarious items have gone for walk this year\nand lost their way back.\nI would like to thank all of this year's committee especially Josie Glausiuz for\nputting up with my incredible laziness and\nwish Richard Eccleston and next year's committee all the best in the future.\nThe problems faced by the world today\nputs into perspective the role of students at\nIC. We come here to get an education not\njust to get a piece of paper at the end\nqualifying us to be called engineers or\nscientists. Part of that education must be\ndirected towards answering the question\n'what am I here for?' and in answering that\nquestion you will do your bit in solving the\nreal problems that afflict you.\nVACATION WORK AT THE SCIENCE MUSEUM\nThe Science Museum has vacancies for two Assistants to help run its 'Test Bed'\nfrom 29 July to 31 August 1985.\n\u2022Test Bed1\nis an area, open only at certain times, where visitors can handle\nand experiment with a number of specially prepared exhibits in a more direct\nand informal way than is possible elsewhere in the Science Museum.\nThe Assistant's job is to be on duty when Test Bed is open, and to\n- talk to visitors and encourage them to try things\n- carry out running maintenance on the exhibits\nHours: 11.15am to 5.30pm Mondays to Saturdays (inclusive) for 5 weeks,\nstarting on Monday 29 July and finishing on Saturday 31 August.\nPay: \u00a316\u2014\u00a318 a session, depending on age.\nApplications: Further details can be obtained from the Information Desk in\nthe Science Museum, or from Michael Williams, Launch Pad Project, Science\nMuseum, Exhibition Road, London SW7 2DD( Tel: 589 3456 ext 588/625).\nClosing date for applications: 21 June 1985\nFEUX Friday 7 June 1985 13\n\n"

Early\npitch inspection in Hyde Park\nhad revealed more of a barren\nstrip of turf than the lush grass of\nthe Wembley surface that many\nof the players were accustomed\nto. However, make-shift posts\nwere installed and the game\ncommenced at 11.00am. Hamlet Gardens first team\nwere quickly into their stride and\nscored with a good shot early in\nthe game. Mining House first\nteam retaliated and were\nrewarded by a penalty for handball taken ruthlessly by Guy\n'Lucky Lad' Poppy. Soon\nafterwards a head-clash between\nJohn Burke of Mining and a Hamlet defender lead to the\nlatter being taken to hospital with\nan eye-wound requiring several\nstitches. John Burke continued\nto play but later received three\nstitches to a cut in his head when\nbits of brain were found on the\nball. This gave Mining an\nunexpected advantage but all to\nno avail as Hamlet quickly\nscored again to lead two to one\nwith only ten men (visions of\nManchester United!!).\nMining were fast to turn the\ntables. Jon Ager equalized with a well-taken goal, involving a sprint\nthat would have left Carl Lewis\nfloundering. Indeed, Jon's effort\nwas such that his half-time\norange was found 'floundering'\noutside the Zetland on his return\nto Evelyn Gardens. Another goal\nby Jon Ager followed by a Hamlet own-goal within a minute\nmade the score four to two at half\ntime.\nSuperb footwork on the left by\nGuy Poppy lead to a well-taken\nLogistix Recruitment Limited\n148 King Street, Hammersmith, London W6 OQU\nTelephone 01-741 8511-7\nGraduates &\nPost Graduates\nCOMPUTER SCIENCE/ELECTRONICS/\nELECTRICAL ENGINEERING\nSince 1978, our company has assisted large\nnumbers of I.C. graduates find employment in the\ncomputer industry.

However,\nHamlet dictated the run of the\nplay but were kept at bay by\nsome acrobatics by Dave Martin\nin the Mining goal, he also made\nsome fine saves. A goal though,\nfor Hamlet, brought them back\ninto contention at five to three.\nThis contention was short-lived for after some one-touch\nWATER POLO\nfootball by Mark 'Vyvyan'\nBarrow and Ivan 'Elephant\nshorts' Parkin, Hugo Alexander\nput away his first and Mining's sixth. Jon Ellis and Bruce\nAinsworth found the legs to keep\nrunning in the energy-lapping\nheat and created an opening for\nMartin Brook to casually take his\nsecond goal and end the final\nseven to three to Mining House.\nA fair season\nAlthough we started the season\nwell by winning the ULU Water\nPolo knockout cup (?) despite a handicap of -6 goals, the rest of\nthe season wasn't so successful.\nIn the Southern Division of the\nUAU tournament we finished\nsecond to Bristol, the eventual\nrunners up in the final. Although\nwe played badly on the day, it's fair to say that Bristol fought\nharder for the ball and deserved\ntheir place in the final. In the play\noff for the last place in the final,\nwe lost 7-6 under dubious\ncircumstances to Loughborough. We found it frustrating\nnot to be able to defend the t it fe we'd won last year, although\nBirmingham had such a strong\nsquad we would have been\ncompeting for runner up medals\nonly.\nThe swimming team, although\nsmall in number, were far more\nsuccessful. By doubling the\nnumber of tournaments they\nentered, they were able to\ncompete twice. Like the water\npolo squad they were able to win\nthe UL U championship\ncomfortably for the umpteenth\ntime. The main event, however,\nwas their first entry in the UAU\nlong course championships held\nat Liverpool. A four man team\nwas sent, comprising Dave\nBrocklebank, Ian Ruddle, James\nPearson, and Paul Richardson.\nEven though only nine out of a total of 24 events were\ncontested, they still finished third\noverall against much larger\ntear rf s. James Pearson came\nsecond in the 100m backstroke\nand third in the 100m freestyle,\nwith the relay team finishing\nsecond in the medley and fourth\nin the free style events. Next year\nwe shall be entering the UAU\nsprint championships and also\nhope to be able to find a womens\nteam in order to compete against\nother universities.\nColours were awarded to the\nswimming team of Pearson,\nBrocklebank, Ruddle and\nRichardson, and half colours to\nNick Ireland and Dave Wall for\nwater polo. Thanks to Stuart\nChorlton and Paul Richardson\nfor all their hard work this year.\n16 Friday 7 June 1985 FEUX\n\n"

They\nchallenged the quorum and\nwalked out of the room, leaving\nthe meeting in quo rate. The NSSO was set up amid\ncontroversy over its membership\npolicy which will exclude student\nunions not affiliated to the NUS( as reported in FELIX701).

    "content": "The FELIX/Student Services Guide to\nAccommodation\nPlanning\nIntroduction\nFinding somewhere to live is a serious\nbusiness. It calls for careful planning and\nhard work. The aim of this guide is to give\nyou information you need to make the best of\nyour efforts and to help ensure that you end\nup in accommodation which will enhance\nrather than detract from your enjoyment of\nthe year ahead.\nUnlike some University Towns, London\noffers a wide variety of accommodation in\nmany different areas. As you commit\nyourself to ideas about how far away you\nwant to live, how much you are prepared to\npay and so on, you restrict the available\noptions and make your task that much\nharder.\nSharing or living alone\nThe first decision is whether to team up with\nother people or whether to go it alone. One\nbig advantage of the go it alone approach is\nthat a large proportion of the\naccommodation on offer is for one person.\nAlso, you can choose where you want to live\nwithout having to consider other peoples\nviews. Flats with single rooms are few and far\nbetween so if you are set on not sharing a room, then this may be your best strategy.\nThe main disadvantages are that living alone\ncan be very lonely, especially in London and\ni unless you can maintain a good social life at\nCollege or elsewhere, you might be letting\nyourself in for a pretty miserable time.\nConversely the main advantage of sharing is\nthat you have guaranteed company and the\nwork involved in finding a place is shared as\nwell. Whereas if you are living alone you will\nalmost certainly have to share bathroom\nfacilities with strangers, and will either have\nto share a kitchen or put up with a Baby\nBelling in your room, a flat share means that\nas a group you will have your own kitchen\nand bathroom and even a sitting room as\nwell. On the minus side, the strain of living on\ntop of each other in a small flat can lead to\npersonality clashes with people dropping\nout, leaving the remainder with the problem\nof finding a replacement or the rent.\nCommitting yourself to a group can severely\nlimit the number of suitable places. In order\nto help you decide on the basis of availability,\nhere is a breakdown of 863 offers of\naccommodation which appeared on the\nStudent Services accommodation lists\nbetween September 1984 and May 1985:-Number\naccommodated\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nPercentage\nof offers\n48.7\n25.3\n6.0\n10.4\n4.3\n3.4\n1.0\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n100\nArea\nNaturally enough, most people want to live\nas close to College as possible and the virtual\nphasing out of the facility for re-claiming\ntravel expenses from local authorities\nprovides a strong financial incentive for\ndoing so. The old argument that more distant\naccommodation is cheaper doesn't count for\nmuch anymore, since the cost of travel\nadded on to the cheaper rent is likely to\namount to the same as you would be paying\nclose to College.\nThe advantages of looking further afield\nare more to do with availability. Widening the\narea that you are prepared to look at means\nthat you will have more offers of\naccommodation to choose from and this in\nturn will increase your chances of finding\nsomething suitable. It makes sense to take\nsome time to look at as many areas as\npossible before deciding. Places like\nBayswater, Fulham, Clapham and Chiswick\nall have attractions which, for many people,\nmake the travel worthwhile.\nRent\nThe amount of rent that you can offer is a very significant factor in determining where\nyou end up living. Over the last year or so,\ni the situation has been distorted by the\navailability of housing benefits for most kinds\nof rented accommodation. The distortion\nhas arisen because people have felt able to\npay more, in anticipation of receiving\nhousing benefits and landlords have raised\ntheir prices accordingly. As many have\nfound, however, it is not a good idea to rely\non housing benefits mainly because of the\nvery long periods which elapse between\nmaking a claim for benefit and getting the\nmoney. This has left many students facing\nsevere cash flow problems. Another\ndiscouraging factor is that it is by no means\ncertain that housing benefit will be available\nto students in the future, particularly in view\nto the governments commitment to end\nstudent entitlement to Housing Benefit and\nSupplementary Benefit\nThe calculations for housing benefit are\nfairly complicated and the amounts which\npeople actually receive are rarely what one\nmight expect. Nevertheless, to give you a rough idea of what you might be able to get\nnext year if you are on a standard grant, take\nthe rent exclusive of heating and lighting and\ndeduct \u00a322. You can hope to get back about'\n60% of the difference but it would be\ndangerous to rely on this to any great extent.\nWhen to look\nAs most of you will probably have discovered\nby now, it is very difficult to fix up\naccommodation in advance. Landlords\nknow that they can fill their accommodation\neasily whenever a vacancy arises. It doesn't make sense for them to commit themselves\nto having the ac com md ation available in the\nfuture because this would effectively mean\nthat if the accommodation became vacant\nbefore then they would have to keep it empty\nand lose rent. It is certainly much easier to\nfind accommodation if you are looking for\nplaces which are available immediately and\nare ready to move in and start paying rent a once. This means that September is by far\nthe best time to look. Although there is a lot\nof accommodation available during\nSeptember, the main difficulty is that there\nare a great many other people looking for\naccommodation during that period as well.\nFEUX Friday 7 June 1985\n\n"
