    "content": "Dear Sir\nIn FELIX606 you printed\na one page advert for Barclays\nBank. Surely it is wrong, especially for a Union pub li cation, to publicise or take\nmoney from a company which is so closely linked to\nthe South African apartheid\nsystem.\nBarclays benefits greatly\nfrom its South African links,\nand forms a significant part oi\nthat countries economy. Barclays is the largest bank in\nSouth Africa, with over 1,000\nbranches in South Africa and\nNamibia. The South African\nsubsidiary, Barclays National,\nis 60% owned by Barclays in\nBritain, and has over _\u00a3500m invested in government bonds\nand public securities \u2014 a direct investment in the state,\nsupporting and profiting from\nthis evil regime.\nAmongst Barclays contributions to the country's war\neffort the most blatant was its\npurchase of \u00a36.6m of \"de-fence\" bombs, helping finance\nthe armed forces.\nBarclays also contravenes\nUN rulings by operating in\nNamibia( illegally occupied\nby South Africa).\nThe South African regime\ndepends heavily on foreign\ninvestment, both to oppress\nand exploit the 80% non white section of its population,\nand to finance its frequent\ninvasions of neighbouring countries. In 1980, Barclays\nparticipated in a$250m loan\nto South Africa.\nBarclays has already lost\nseveral million pounds worth\nof accounts as a result of the\ncampaign to boycott Barclays.\nThere are two reasons for not\nbanking with Barclays. The\nfirst is on principle\u2014I certainly wouldn't want any of\nmy money to be lent to .South\nAfrica. The second is to put\neconomic pressure on Barclays\nto end its links with racism\nand oppression. I hope any\nactual or potential holders of\nBarclays accounts will bear\nthis in mind.\nGl v n Garside\nEE2 Dear Sir\nHave we got our priorities\nwrong? The Supplies to\nPoland scheme, while good in\ntheory, seems pointless when\nall the factors are considered.\n1. If the Poles were starving\nthe rest of the socialist states\nwould surely help them out,\nrather than running the risk\nof revolution in Poland against the communist system.\nThe Soviets must be in hysterics over the way we are\ngiving away food to prop up a decaying regime. If we want\nto help them, why not give\nthem the means to grasp their\nfreedom? An airlift of armaments to Gdansk for example.\n2. What about Afghanistan? Have we forgotten about\nthe Russian invasion and the\nthousands of dead Afghans?\nBack in 1979 we made a lot of\nnoise about sanctions and very nearly missed the great\npropaganda victory made by\nCoe and Ovett at the 1980\nOlympics (the most politically\norientated since 1936). At least helicopter gunships and\nnapalm are not being used in\nPoland. The average Pole is\nhaving it easy. The most\nhelpful thing we could do for\nthe Afghans would be to\nsupply them with ground-to-air missiles. This would also\nrelieve the pressure on Poland,\nbecause the Soviets would-have to use more of their\ninfantry in Afghanistan, once\ntheir helicopters became less\neffective.\nThese proposals may seem\nextreme, but often the justification of the overthrow of a regime by arms is only accepted afterwards when all\nthe facts are known. Was it\nwrong to overthrow PolPot,\nIdi Amin and Hitler?\nTours sincerely\n'The Caped Crusaders'\n(Names supplied.)\n.S 'tV\nThey' re at it again in Canada!\nBaby seals are being killed\nfor their pelts.\nSometimes they are skinned\nwhile still conscious to save\nthe time and effort of killing\nthem first. Can you imagine\nthe agony they must go\nthrough?\nBetween March8 and 12\nthe European Parliament is\nvoting on whether to ban the\nimport of all skins and products derived from cruelty.\nPlease write to your Euro\nMP asking him to vote in\nfavour of the ban.\nThe Euro MP for our university is: Sir David Nicholson (Euro MP London\nCentral), 15 Hill St., W1 X7 FB. Every letter helps stop the\nslaughter.\nAdrian Delemore\nDept of Mathematics\nDear Mark\nI was indeed puzzled by-the\nletter from\" Puzzled of\nFalmouth/ Ke ogh\".I read in\nmy NME this week that Elton\nJohn has rearranged for the\ncoming autumn a London\nconcert he was forced to\ncancel last spring. When one\nconsiders that the Chefs( just one of the bands featured\nat Links Carnival) have played six London gigs in the\nlast three months, one can\nonly assume that if the writer\nfinds such music \"unfamiliar\"\nit is because he is a lazy\nmindless cretin, too idle to get\noff his fat arse and go and see\nsome of the excellent bands\ncurrently gigging in London.\nTours\n\"Annoyed\"\nWeeks Hall\nDear Mark\nLast year, Barney McCabe was the person in RCS in\ncharge of mascot ry( see the\narticle in the last Broadsheet by\nPaul Johnson). This year, as a sabbatical officer of ICU, he is\nsupposed to treat all sections\nof College equally.\nYet, only the other week,\nhe was displayed on the front\ncover of FELIX( with Marco Led wold, another ICU sabbatical) holding Spanner and Bolt. Last week,\nhe was responsible for leaving\nReggie (the King's College\nmascot) in the Graffitti storeroom, whence Guilds later' liberated' it. These mascots were stolen by RCS, not ICU, and should be of no\nconcern to him, least ways not\nin public and certainly not on\nthe cover of FELIX. The 'Reggie incident' also shows a blatant abuse of position, in\nthat he alone has the master\nkeys to all the Union rooms\nand as such has access to them\nall.\nCome on McCabe, play the\nwhiteman.

    "content": "Hon. Secretary: ROBYN MORGAN proposed by Ray Goundry\nThe job of Honorary Secretary has two sides:\nadministrative duties and, to quote from the\njob description \"....a political function as a member of the Executive committee\". The\nadministrative duties range from taking,\nreproducing and circulating minutes of the\nnumerous committees on which he sits to\nallocating parking permits and being Returning\nOfficer for Union elections. However, it is the\npolitical function as a member of the Executive\nthat makes the Honorary Secretary more than\njust a nine-to-five administrator. Whilst it is the\nPresident's job to actually represent the views\nof students to College, to other students and\nto other external bodies, determining the\nviews and suggesting solutions to any\nproblems must be initiated by all members of\nthe executive, including the Honorary Secretary.\nI believe that I have the enthusiasm to\nperform the administrative duties required and\nThe Guff\nBy now you will no doubt have gathered that\non Monday and Tuesday (March 8 and 9) next\nyear's sabbatical officers will be elected. Only\nMartin S. Taylor has stood for FELIX Editor\n(so there will be elections for the posts of\nPresident, Deputy President and Honorary\nSecretary). His statement of intent will appear\nin next week's issue.\nHopefully you will have witnessed the\ncandidates' antics at yesterday'sU GM, and\nwill have seen the bump f they have produced.\nIn this special FELIX supplement you can read\ntheir individual manifestos, all positively\nbulging with wonderful promises and extensive\nqualifications.\nBefore giving some advice on how to choose\na candidate, I will explain the voting system\nused.\nSTV\nFirstly to vote at all you will need a valid IC\nUnioncard. By showing this you can collect a ballot paper at any of the ballot boxes, which\nwill be situated in all departments from\n9:00am to 5:00pm on Monday and\nTuesday. The card will be punched to\nthe desire to take a full part in the initiation and\nexecution of ideas as part of the Executive. I will not be afraid to propose radical changes in\nthe Union if this is needed but only if it is likely\nthat such a course of action will serve the\ninterests of students and has the support of\nstudents. I also believe that experience of the\nworkings of the Union is, at least, desirable\nand, through being a member last year and\nchairman this year of the Permanent Working\nParty and thus having a seat on Council, I have\nthe knowledge to perform my duties efficiently.\nTo conclude, I ask you first to use your vote.\nThis does not of itself guarantee a Union that\nreflects its members' views but it is a step in\nthe right direction. Secondly, I ask you to vote\nfor me, for an Honorary Secretary who does\nmore than his job is worth.\nRobyn Morgan\nindicate that you have voted. You must cast\nyour vote immediately and not take ballot\npapers away.\nThe voting system used is the Single\nTransferable Vote (STV), by which you\nexpress your preference by putting numbers\n1, 2, 3 etc. by the candidates' names on the\nballot paper. However, if you only have one\npreference put a1 by that candidates name\nand leave the other spaces blank.\nThe purpose of this system is that if there\nare three or more candidates for a post, your\nvote is not \"lost\" if your first choice candidate\nis not elected, but can help your second choice\nwin over a third or fourth candidate.\nTo vote against a candidate, leave the space\nblank rather than putting a2 or 3 against the\nname.\nIf you are unable to decide between the\ncandidates for a post or know nothing about\nany of them, then I urge you to abstain by\nwriting ABSTENTION across the boxes for\nthat post.\nFor a valid election 25% of the Union membership must register a vote. Abstentions\ncount as votes cast but spoilt papers (i.e. defaced, blank or with crosses) are not.\nThe election for a post will be re-run if\nsomeone registers a valid complaint on\nprocedure with the Elections Committee, if\nless than 25% of the membership vote, or if all\nfail to pass quota due to abstentions.\nAdvice\nIt is important that we elect four sabbaticals\nwho will perform their duties well. After all,\nthese people influence the activity of the Union\nto such an extent, that you should make an\neffort to ensure an informed decision.\nFirstly, by reading election handouts and\nposters you will be able to find out who is\nstanding and why.\nHustings are usually a surprisingly good way\nof deciding \u2014 you' d be amazed at how\npeople's real qualities are revealed during\nspeeches and especially questions. If you didn't attend yesterday'sU GM then ask a friend how the candidates fared. But a word of\nwarning: NEVER be influenced too much by a proposer. You must remember that the\nproposer will not be doing the job and will\nnormally have been chosen to say the few\nthings that a candidate's modesty may prevent\nhim from revealing personally.\nAs for the various promises made in the\nmanifestos (and elsewhere), you must be\ncritical; decide what you think that the\nsabbatical should do and then find the best\ncandidate.\nSome people warp the truth or lie outright,\nbut you must try to choose people who intend\nto do something and not just keep the Union\nticking over.\nYou should not be influenced by sex, race or\nother asides but choose the best person who\nhas the ability to perform the duties required.\nAlso do not pay too much attention to strings\nof qualifications, but concentrate on why one\nperson's ideas might be better than another.\nOf course you can always abstain if you\nthink all the candidates are poor. I intend to do\nthis in the Honorary Secretary election for\ninstance, because none of the candidates\ncould possibly convince me that they are\nsuitable. I will abstain in the hope that the Hon Sec election will be re-run and somebody who I consider is suited for the post will stand\n(perhaps a defeated candidate from one of the\nother elections?).\nSo remember to vote on Monday and Tuesday, even if you know nothing about the\ncandidates and merely wish to abstain. Every\nvote cast is important in that it gives a measure\nof popularity, interest and satisfaction with the\ncandidates and Union.\noO Of vr ll "

    "content": "President: STEVE GOULDER proposed by Pallab Ghosh\nThe Candidate\nStephen Goulder is a third year undergraduate\nin the Biochemistry department. While at\nImperial College has taken an active and\nconstructive role in the Union. As Social Clubs\nCommittee Chairman he has encouraged a substantial increase in club activity. This affects a wide range of students, not just\nhacks. Steve also spent eight months last year\ncoordinating the RCS Centenary celebrations.\nSteve has proved himself to be an able\ncandidate for President. He has the experience\nand ability to bring about improvements for\nstudents next year.\nPallab Ghosh\nThe Policies\nRefectories\nLittle has been done to improve the quality of\nfood available in College. To achieve anything\nwe must demonstrate widespread popular\nsupport for our policies. I intend to do this by\norganising a refectory boycott for the first\nweek of November. As President I also\npropose to bring the Union Refectory under\nUnion control as a profit making concern.\nResidence\nIt is clear that any new student accommodation\nmust be in the form of Head Tenancies or\nshort life housing schemes. However, some\nconditions in Hamlet and Cambridge Gardens\nare appalling. I do not expect students to live in\nsuch conditions, the Union will support any\naction taken to improve this situation.\nExternal Affairs\nWe must have an active voice in the current\nreorganisation of London University instigated\nby S winner ton Dyer. Because of its high\nproportion of overseas students it is important\nthat I take a special interest in their increasingly difficult situation.\nAcademic Affairs\nIt will be essential for me to take an active role\nin Academic Affairs next session when the first\npart of the Rector's20% cut in all departments\nis being made. We must fight any cut in\nstudent numbers and in the quality of learning\nat this College.\nStephen Goulder\nPresident: ANDREW LYALL proposed by David Jago\nIt is almost universally accepted among Imperial College students that in recent years\ntheir Union has become completely out of\ntouch with the student body. The small group\nof students who traditionally surround the\nExecutive are not typical of the IC student and\nserve only to isolate them from student\nopinion. The best way to overcome this\nproblem would be for the President to hold a regular surgery on, say Monday lunchtime\nduring which any student, not merely officers\nand 'hacks' will be able to talk with the Union\nPresident about anything that might concern\nhim/her, be it academic, personal or political.\nThis, you may think is very simple \u2014 it is, but I must emphasize, unlike the grand and ex h orbit ant claims presidential candidates\nnormally make its simplicity means that it will\nbecome a reality.\nIn my view implementation of such simple\nideas will bring about the much needed,\nincreased communication which will itself\nbring great rewards in other directions: for a united student body lead by an informed and\ndetermined President will be hard to resist.\nAt first sight, through not having previously\nheld high office in the Union, it may seem that I am under qualified for the job of President.\nHowever in my five years at IC (two on my\nlegs, one in hospital and the last two in a wheel\nchair) I have always represented my year\ngroup on the staff/student academic affairs\ncommittees, I have taken two degrees in\nwidely differing subjects, experienced two\nconstituent colleges and their unions and met\na great number of people.\nI would like to be the new type of Union\nPresident Imperial College desperately needs\nin this coming year. To do it I need your vote.\nThe choice is yours.\nA. Lyall\nPresident: J. MARTIN TAYLOR proposed by Andrew Needham\nI decided at the outset of this campaign not to\nmake un keep able promises merely to grab\nvotes. But there's only space for a brief outline\nof my intentions, so very quickly.\nGrants\nI think it's time we stopped burying our head in\nthe sand. Next year is going to be very difficult\nfor many students, and we must campaign to\nprevent the year after being even worse.\nEducation Cuts\nMany of you will have felt their first effects.\nWorse is to come. However, we shouldn't just\nhave blanket opposition to all changes caused\nby cuts. We must play a full part in discussions\nsurrounding them, whilst maintaining our opposition.\nRefectories\nThere have been some improvements this\nyear at the Union's instigation. We must keep\non pushing our ideas next year. I won't be\ncalling for a boycott, because Mooney simply\nisn't capable of doing his job without our help.\nResidence\nThis year we've accepted mid-session rent\nincreases without protest. I'm determined to\nstop this happening again. Halls are very\nexpensive already and steps must be taken to\nhold costs down next year.\nIn general the President must take time to\ngauge opinion, not just rely on the few people\nat UG Ms. Socialising other than in the Union\nBar is essential.\nAlso, he must stand up for students\ninterests, not always bending to the\nconvenience of the College authorities.\nFinally, beware. So much crap is talked in\nthese elections, even by candidates who should know better. If you want a President\nwho is experienced (I 've been External Affairs\nOfficer for IV2 years), sees things from a student (not a College) point of view, and isn't just out to inflate his own ego or get a cushy\njob next year, then give me your vote.\nCut the crap and let's go!\n\n"

Many powerful thrusts on the right flank eventually-led to a gaol by Forbus, assisted well by\nEldrigian who played throughout with the\nspeed of as e ige engine and the skill of a battering ram. The second goal followed\ngood work on the right flank by Farmus and\nwas scored by Wy lian,a wild tribesman from\nthe frozen land far North. Individual skirmishes broke out between the armies,\ninvolving Sharpus and Forbus. Meanwhile\nWy lian had added to his second goal and\nF'arm us scored just on full-time.

Fortunately we were able to\ndrag another player from bed since the\numpire knew of her whereabouts. Chris(tina)\nalso readily agreed to play if we provided him\nwith a skirt.\nAfter only five minutes of play we were 1 -0\nbehind due to Chris(tina) being overcome by\nthe opposition.\nHalftime oranges (what did you put in them Caroline?) and our captain's usual\ninspiring team talk soon resulted in three\ngoals in less than five minutes to which\nanother one was later added to bring the\ntotal to four.\nChris(tina) had a particularly good game,\nthe SOP team members seeming to enjoy his\nphysical contact!

This is absolute\nrubbish. My letters would be far more interesting than the drivel I 've received in the\npast few weeks. Where have all the good\nletters gone?\nThe Barclays Bit\nI must admit that I expected to be challenged\nover including a Barclays advert earlier. Mr Gar side's letter is to say the least fairly\npredictable, but it does merit a response.\nFirstly, I will happily except adverts from\nBarclays for financial reasons. This bank and\nothers provide a large amount of support for\nvarious publications (and hence indirectly the\nUnion) by advertising.\nWithout their support the Union would have\nto save in the order of \u00a31,000 elsewhere\u2014\nperhaps by abolishing Socialist Society, AntiApartheid Group, Labour Club, Liberal Club,\netc., etc.? I'm certain that such committed\nindividuals would rather fund their own activities than take money from Barclays.\nHowever this argument is not really\nsufficient by itself.

Whilst sympathizing with the fight against apartheid I would not willingly exclude adverts from\nanyone {even vile multi-nationals) as I believe\nthat individuals at Imperial College are intelligent enough to discriminate between the\ncompanies and organisations with which they\nwant to be involved. Students are well aware of\nthe issues involved in South Africa, including\nBarclays' involvement, and can choose whether they wish to bank with them or not.\nPerhaps most important of all, Barclays are\na damn good bank and are not the only\ninvestors in South Africa. Unfortunately South\nAfrica has a tight grip over international\nfinance due to its mineral wealth and, unless\nwe wish to trade with the Soviet Union for\ngold, uranium, etc., we are stuck. Personally I find the Soviet Union's system of 'democracy'\nequally unacceptable.\nBy not giving people the chance to choose\nwe are repressing their own freedom. So come\non Anti-Apartheid persons, stop complaining.\nIt's just not cricket.\nHustings UGM\nThis wasn't half as exciting or entertaining\nas usual. Presumably this was due to the\ncandidates themselves.\nThe only positive thing to come out of it\nwas to reaffirm my conviction that I should\nabstain in the Honorary Secretary election,\nas none of the candidates struck me as\nbeing outstanding.

    "content": "The truth about my\nother life\nby Barney McCabe\nHow much more of this bullshit must we be\nsubjected to? Nobody, least of all an election\ncandidate, has yet hit upon what doing a sabbatical Union job is about. It's not about\nboycotting this, opposing that, striking here or\noccupying there. It's not about making UG Ms interesting, or getting people involved in and to\nrespect \"their Union\". All of these ideas are\nwhat a large group of egotistical ign or ami imagine are the key functions of a \"sabbatical\".\nThey are wrong.\nThe most important qualify needed in a sabbatical is a commitment to helping other\npeople; whether it be directing them to the\nnearest MacDonalds or opening the Gym changing rooms, there must be that commitment to helping. 90% of the job I do is\ngeared to helping students get on with their\nbusiness.\nThe organisation of which I am part and\nwhich exists generally to serve students has\ntwo distinct functions. The first is to provide\nadministrative back-up for well over 100 active\nclubs and societies; rooms and equipment for\nstudents' use and a stable organisation distributing public money fairly among those\nsocieties. The second function of this\norganisation is to ensure that all the other\nservices (provided mostly by College) for\nstudents\u2014from \"an education\" to refectories,\nresidence to welfare\u2014are provided as high\na standard as possible. For the Union to\nperform this second function there exists a complete network of accountable (i.e. elected)\nrepresentatives or observers on all the College\ndecision and policy making committees (apart,\nthat is, from the Rector's Policy Committee\nand the Examining Boards!). The representatives play an extremely valuable role in putting\nthe students' case where it is relevant. In this\nway, the Union plays a constructive part in the\nrunning of the College; a part which is fully\nintegrated with the administration of the\nCollege and which is respected by those who\nultimately govern it.\nBy far the greatest demand on a sabbatical's time (especially the DPs and Hon Sees) comes\nfrom the first of the two functions outlined\nabove. The wrath of the few hundred people\nper day who visit the Union Office would soon\nbe down on a sabbatical who, through campaigning in other directions, allowed his\nattentions to sway from the needs of the\nsocieties. Fine he/she would make UG Ms popular; fine he/she would make more news\nfor FELIX; fine he/she would achieve great\npolitical popularity; but at what expense? It\nwould be quite wrong to damage the clubs and\nsocieties merely in order to conform to the\nmisconceptions of a misguided few, after all\nhow does one judge the success of a nation? Is\nit by the size and strength of its army, or, is it\nby the quality of life of its people?\n\"But what about UG Ms?\"I hear you ask. As\nfar as I am concerned aUG M is where I go for\na little self-indulgent fun. it is a forum for\ndebate which leads to policy; it is a rubber-stamp body but that is not all. No! It's a great\nopportunity for egotists to further their\ninterests. The hacks and would-be hacks among you will probably be crying out in\ndisgust at my lack of concern for our democratic body. AUG M is not democratic, it\nhas nothing to do with democracy, it merely\nserves to give the appearance to College of\nenormous student power when it mandates\none of us to pursue a particular policy. That's about the only reason why we bother with\nthem at all.\nIn summary, I have enjoyed most of the\npublicity I 've personally had at IC, soT'm sure,\nhave other Union Officers. Much of it has been\nuntrue, but it's all been fun. I wouldn't have let\nmyself in for all those snotty jobs which are\nnever individually important or interesting\nenough to mention in FELIX if it wasn't for the\nopportunity of a bit of ego-tripping, nor would\nanyone else in their right mind.\nMay I suggest that, should you want to vote,\nyou vote for proven commitment to helping\nothers, and vote for technical com pet ance in\nevery field, from Committee handling through\nto duplicator operating to pinball machine\nrepairing!\nThank-you for reading.\nThe case against\nApartheid\nby Graeme Shaw\n1982 has been declared \"International Year of\nMobil is ation of Sanctions Against South Africa\" by the United Nations. The issue about\nsanctions is an old one. It was first introduced\nin about 1957. However, the reason why it has\nhad little effect is that there has been no\nsolidarity in the sanctions campaign, there\nhave always been countries that disobeyed UN policy, and unfortunately Britain is the worst\nculprit. At the last UN Assembly, fourteen\nresolutions were passed on apartheid; only\ntwo countries did not vote for them, one was\nthe USA and the other, Britain.\nThe need for sanctions against S Africa has\ncome about because of the \"stubborn efforts\nof the regime to perpetuate racist domination\nby an ever increasing dependence on violence\nand repression and to continue its illegal\noccupation of Namibia, in defiance of repeated\nappeals by the international community and\nflagrant contravention of the United Nations\nCharter, the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights and the Declaration on Granting of\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and\nPeoples\" this has \" created an explosive\nsituation in Southern Africa and constitutes no\nlonger a threat to, but a manifest breach of\ninternational peace and security j' But why hasn't the UN Security Council\ntaken any action? Simple, because Britain and\nthe USA are permanent members of the\nCouncil.\nThe call for sanctions is total and complete,\nit includes an effective oil embargo, a cessation\nof collaboration with South Africa in the\nmilitary and nuclear fields, and of investments\nin and loans to South Africa, it also calls for the\ndenial of certain supplies, such as electronic\nand communications equipment, machinery\nand chemicals, as well as technology.\nYou may argue that by implementing sanctions Britain would be doing more harm to\nthe black oppressed people in Southern Africa. The UN recognizes this, but the people\nin South Africa and the frontline states have\nalready laid their heads on the line by making\nthe plea for sanctions, have we the right to say\nthey are wrong? Still, the UN affirms that the\ncost of sanctions is very small compared to the\ncost of the existing human suffering and degradation in South Africa and the threat to\ninternational peace.\nAlternatively, you may argue that sanctions\nwould be detrimental to the British economy,\nas we depend upon trade with South Africa,\nespecially for some minerals, such as\nvanadium and tungsten. However, much of\nthis dependence is false, unnecessary and\nfoolish; Dr David Owen, when he was British\nForeign Secretary stated that \"we are in a position of depending on South Africa far more \\\nthan is healthy if we are to pursue consistent\nand viable foreign and economic policies.\"\nPeople also argue that British companies\nwould do more good by operating in South\nAfrica than by pulling out, but what is the\nevidence to support this? The non-whites still\nhave poor wages, about a tenth of those for\nwhite workers, few amenities, poor education\nand housing and barely any political or civil\nrights. Even Barclays, which is better than,\nmost companies, gives fewer opportunities to\nits black employees, and although they pay\nwages that are higher than the national\naverage, it is of little use when they are actively\nsupporting the government, b? buying Government Defense Bonds for example.\nSouth Africa is a \"democracy\" (for whites)\nand not all of them support apartheid as\nfervently as the government, so it would take\nonly a little more international pressure to\nmake a majority of the whites realise that the\ntime had come to dismantle the apartheid\nregime. It wouldn't take long if sanctions were\napplied, and Britain could manage without\ntrading with South Africa, for a short while at\nleast, whether by stockpiling beforehand or else\nusing alternative suppliers. Even partial sanctions would have an effect, or cutting off\ndiplomatic relations\u2014but something must be\ndone.\nImperial College too is linked to South Africa.\nIn 1965 Sir William Penney, Chairman of\nUK A EA and Rector of IC, visited South Africa\n\"when the Pelindaba reactor went 'critical'\". In\n1979 there was an advert in the Johannesburg\nSunday Times inviting students to apply for a course in nuclear reactor science and engineering at Imperial College. The Royal\nSchool of Mines has obvious examples of\ncollaboration with South Africa; there are\nabout half a dozen students sponsored by\nSouth African companies, students work out\nthere during the summer vacation and some\neven go out there to live and lecturers often\nvisit to give seminars or advise. This is all in\ncontravention of UN policy.\nThe College Careers Advisory Service\ninvites such companies as Rio Tinto Zinc,\nChartered Consolidated Services Ltd (part of\nAnglo American) and others to the College,\nfie se companies come to recruit white\nstudents to work in South Africa, to help boost\nthe economy and sustain the apartheid regime.\nIt would do no one any harm to end our\nhospitality to these companies; the Careers\nAdvisory Service could still publicise their\nvacancies and graduates could simply tre ck across London for their interviews. Thus nobody's freedom would be impeded and we\ncould show our disapproval of the South\nAfrican government.\nSo what else can we do? Stop banking with\nBarclays is one answer, it is still the biggest\nbank in South Africa and supports the Pretoria\nregime, far more so than any other high street\nbank. Secondly, don't buy South African products and third y, go on the National March\non March 14.

Miss Hazel Cheeseborough and\nMr Bruce Bricknell will be Academic Affairs Officer and Honorary\nJunior Treasurer respectively.\nThe meeting opened at 1:07pm with a large crowd present in the\nGreat Hall. Mike, the Union mascot, was also present.\nThe motion was put forward during the President's business and the\nmeeting decided that it should be heard immediately. It was proposed\nby Philip Nathan and after he had received several extensions, Mr Nick Morton opposed the motion. Mr Morton then moved to the\ncentre of the hall and nearly brought the hall down with a rousing\nspeech. The motion of no confidence was heavily defeated.\nOther reports were accepted without complication.

Steve Thompson's two penalty goals were sufficient\nto provide a63 win in a game which sometimes produced promising ball handling, but the thrust of Downs and Miles\nThompson was often cut out by the keen\nQM C back-row and three-quarters. Had the\nGutteridge Cup not been at stake, F'a zak e rly might have passed the ball to his three-quarters more often, but sadly this was outside\nthe tactics of the game. All IC's points came in\nthe first-half, with the wind in Thompson's favour.\nQM C lost two players during the battle\nand perhaps the front-five of IC's pack did\ngive their opposition too much rough stuff.\nAfter the game, Adam Warby, IC's multi-talented skipper, was disappointed to hear\nthat the England selectors did not consider\nhim as a likely choice to fill the full-back\nposition on Saturday.

The \"starboard\" league on\nSaturday was won by ICl who won four out\nof five races, with University College second.\nSt Mary's Hospitals/Kings College won the\n'port' league with ICA second, scraping\nthrough by beating St. Thomas' Hospital in a race where both teams retired by sailing one\nlap too few and Thomas' took one more\n'green' (penalty) than ICA. On Sunday the wind was excellent i br team racing and further interest was provided by a large number of Wembley\nS.C. boats who were racing round some of the\nsame marks as UL. St. Mary's Hospital\nretired after being resoundingly thrashed by\nICA and UC. As ICA prepared to sail ICl the course was changed and had to be sailed\nin, the opposite direction. This led to the\nLewis epic \"push everyone the right side of\nthe mark and then sail the wrong side\nyourself manoeuvre\". Following this, Chadwick leaned out over-enthusiastically\nand missed the toe-straps on the beat and\nwent swimming. Ajderian covering Lewis on\nthe final beat forced him to gybe to break the\ncover and gave ICA first, second and fifth on\nthe line..\nICl, sailing excellently, beat University\nCollege convincingly in both the races they\nwere to sail against them.\nICA beating UC in a close fought contest\nby ll'/2 to ll3/., pts, made it clear that the\nreal competition was between two IC teams.\nThe violence on the line caused surprisingly only one collision and despite five ol\nthe six boats arriving at the windward mark\ntogether, there were no collisions there. The sixth boat, sailed by Cur wen, had re crossed the start line and was some way behind.\nPlaces changed continuously down to the\nleeward mark where, again, Adj started\nsitting on Lewis and general malevolence\nemin a ting from all quarters meant that by\nthe second rounding of the windward mark\nsix collisions or infringements had occured,\nthree by each side. Then in a fair(ish) light\nICl won but not by a sufficient amount to\nhave an overall win over ICA. This left ICA only to beat UC for the\noverall it tle, they did this excellently pushing\none UC boat to the back requiring UC to get\nfirst place to win. On an excellent final beat\nthe super heavy weight Nick Adj again pulled through into first place allowing Mills who had sailed consist ant ly well throughout\nthe weekend into third race.\nThanks are due to Castaways for excellent\nsocial and racing organisation.\nICA team:S.

    "content": "Supplies to Poland\nFurther details\nIn the last week encouraging impetus has been gained by the 'Supplies to\nPoland' group's project which involves the transport and distribution in\nPoland, of 200 tonnes (ten lorries worth!) of food, clothing and medical\nsupplies which should ease the hardship of at least some of those that are\nsuffering as a result of the shortages caused by the recent crisis. In\nparticular, special baby foods and the supplies in many hospitals are\ndangerously low. The crew comprising of about fifteen Imperial College\nstudents is now virtually complete and will be meeting with any other\nhelpers every Tuesday and Friday at 12:45pm in the Union Upper Dining\nHall.\nThe preferred plan for the project was originally conceived outside the\nCollege and is both ambitious and highly original. Now the challenge is\nbeing met by a group made up solely of Imperial College students and\nstaff run by Malcolm Clarke, an electrical engineering postgraduate.\nHoping to go this coming vacation, it is planned to ship the supplies on the\nElbe from Hamburg to Prague on a single 200t barge whose owner can\nhopefully be persuaded to come and pick up the cargo in London.\nNormally barges travel empty in this direction and should therefore be\navailable quite cheaply. In Prague where we have contacts in the\nTechnical University the supplies will be divided into ten Czech lorries.\nEach lorry will be accompanied by some Imperial College students to the\ndestinations for the supplies designated by the Church and the State in\nPoland. At present such supplies are being distributed through either\nChurch or State networks, but in this way we hope in some way to keep a check on whether the supplies arriving from the West are actually\nreaching those who really require the assistance. If successful such a venture will not only help the Polish people but also allay doubts in Britain\nabout the final outcome of such donations once in Polish hands and\nhence possibly encourage more aid in the future.\nWe are working on the project with an established charity, the\nOckenden Venture, which will be organising the collection of the supplies\nin Britain. However we still need funds and donations of supplies and\ntherefore we apnea! to anybody who has contacts with a firm or knows of\na firm who may be interested in our scheme to contact Malcolm Clarke\nthrough the Union Office letter-racks. You could even contact them on\nour behalf. Similarly any helpful comments and ideas and any alternatives\nto the scheme will be gratefully appreciated.\nLoughborough race home\nHyde Park suffered an invasion on Saturday afternoon as 700 runners\nsought to complete their laps in Imperial College's34 th annual Hyde Park Relay. Sebastian Coe's failure to appear disappointed some, but\nthe event was still graced by a number of international stars and teams\nfrom as far away as Sweden. Coe's absence did not stop Loughborough\nUniversity retaining the title, while the Ladies' Race attracted a record\nnumber of entries.\nAt the prize-giving, Dr Tony Watts recounted how the event had\nbeen started with 9 teams in 1949. The event was sponsored by\nNational Westminster Bank who have now sponsored it for a number\nof years.

In the near future the controversy can\nonly intensify as Trident becomes more\nexpensive and as the government attempts to\nsite Cruise missiles here. Unfortunately, all this\nhas not usually been accompanied by an increase in knowledge and understanding of\nthe underlying issues. MPs are themselves\nignorant, as was demonstrated by the low\nlevel of debate during the first parliamentary\ndiscussion of Nuclear Arms policy for 15 years\nin March1980.^ This Saturday, March6, there is an opportunity for people to discuss and learn\nmore about the vitally important issues. In\ncooperation with a local C ND and World\nDisarmament Campaign( WDC) group, ICC ND has organised an all-day 'Teach In'. In\nthe morning there will be four talks by\ndistinguished speakers. Then, in the afternoon\nparticipants choose one of six workshops\nwhere they will discuss and analyse one area in\ndepth. The role play workshop would allow\nyou to relive and analyse those arguments that\nyou wish you had fared better in.\nFor the last hour everyone meets together\nagain for a talk about what has been resolved\nand what this means for the future.\nThings are moving fast. The Women's Peace\nCamps outside the proposed Cruise missile\nbases need support and publicity. The UN Second Session on Disarmament in June is\nbecoming an important focus of attention as\nwe discover that Reagan and Thatcher do not\nintend to participate.

    "content": "Deputy President: GERARD LIVETT proposed by William Waterson\nOver the past years, we have seen a succession of sabbatical Union Officers who\nseem barely capable of doing the job.\nPart of the problem as I can see it is that the\ncandidates who get themselves elected have\nbecome so in twined with the Union heir arch y that they lose touch with the reality of life on\ncampus.\nIt will be my intention as Deputy President\nto inject a new and youthful vitality to the\nUnion.\nPeople will ask me the most obvious question: \"What experience have you had in\nUnion affairs so far?\"\nDuring the course of last term, 1 was elected\na member of the Entertainments Committee.\nMost of my sparetime is now spent helping\nwith events that the entertainments committee\norganise.\nWith respect to my entertaining commit tm ents students ask me: \" Why doesn't the Ents\nCommittee stage any big concerts?\" The\nanswer to this is quite simple. We (the Ents\nCommittee) do not receive a large enough\ngrant from the Union. This is one thing I am\ncampaigning for, a larger Ents grant. I would\nalso improve the facilities in the Union, such as\nthe toilets, the kitchens, etc.\nStudent welfare is another branch of my\nc once( a) rn. It would be my duty to encourage\nmore students to become aware of what is\navailable to them. I would also vehemently\noppose any infringement of student liberty and\nof their living standards, such as mid-session\nrent increases.\nFor more details see me at the hustings.\nLots of love from,\nGerard Hon.\"Secretary: NIGEL CRYER proposed by Karl Schmidt\nI 've known Nigel since I 've been at Imperial.\nHe's friendly, approachable and well organised\n\u2014 all the qualities necessary for ICU Hon Sec.\nHe's well acquainted with the committees and\nsystem of the Union and thus knows a lot\nabout the job already. As a consequence, he\nrealises the responsibilities which you shall\nbestow upon him by voting for him as ICU Hon Sec. He is the man to do the job and do it\nproperly. So, for a well organised Union next\nyear, vote Nigel Cryer for ICU Hon Sec.\nKarl Schmidt\nI see the job of Hon Sec in two ways; firstly as\nan administrative post and secondly as a representative of students. I will take the\nadministrative responsibilities seriously since,\nif the Union does not run smoothly, then it\ncannot hope to effectively represent the\nstudents on important issues.\nI want to see a new role for the Hon Sec \u2014 it\nhas been all too easy for him to remain in the\nbackground but now, with education cuts, we\nare being exploited more than ever and the\nHon Sec must come out from the shadows and\nactively join in the opposition. Some cuts are\nunavoidable but when they are obviously\nunreasonable, we must unite to fight them.\nIn addition to cuts, there are several other\nareas which I feel require improvement \u2014\nattendance at UG Ms needs to be increased to\nmake them more representative and, with the\npossibility of a blind student in Maths next\nyear, the facilities for such cases in College\nneeds to be investigated.\nI have the experience and enthusiasm to do\nthe job of Hon Sec well so use your vote wisely\nand vote for me \u2014 by doing so, you are voting\nfor an influential and well run Union.\nHon. Secretary: MARY FREEMAN proposed by Frank Rowsell\nIn my three years at Imperial College I have\nwatched my contemporaries become more\nand more remote and isolated from ICU, initial\ninterest and enthusiasm becoming dampened\ndown.\nI am campaigning on Mary's behalf because I am convinced her election will be a significant,\nas well as pleasant, change for the Union. She\nis a candidate who is amply capable of inspiring\nand motivating other people; hard work is no\nstranger to her and she is an effective\norganiser who is able to tackle problems\nwithout fuss. More importantly she is a good\nlistener.\nI urge you to give her the chance to show\nyou this too.\nFrank Rowsell\nTo be honest, my' hack' credibility is\nabsolutely zero. I have not sat on any of the\nfollowing committees: Council, External Affair s,Ent s,T UC,C BI, National Front Overseas committee. So, if you have never\nbeen on any of these either I am the obvious\ncandidate for you.\nHowever, I am a serious candidate for this\npost, and as Hon Sec my priorities would be\n\u2014to carry out all the administrative duties an\nHon Sec is required to do.\n\u2014to function as an active member of the Exec\nin the political field.\n\u2014to thoroughly organise all the paperwork\nand minimize the hump h( wherever possible).\n\u2014to investigate methods of improving the\nrefectories' service (e.g. requesting that large\ndisplays, giving the opening times and a price\nlist, be set up; investigating the reasons for the\nextortionate food prices).\n1 regard a sabbatical post as a full-time job,\nand not a 'year off, but I realise that it is not a straight 9 till 5 job, which means that I am\nprepared to devote as much time as is\nnecessary to do the Hon See's job \u2014 and to do\nit well.\n\n"

It must be great to get a grant and a free room and do bugger all for it. It is obvious\nthat most of you haven't the nous to work this\nout so you might as well vote for me. It is\nYOUR union so YOU must decide whether\nyou want one of the self-serving prat s who are\nstanding against me as your President or self-serving me \u2014 at least I'm honest about it and\nam not a prat.\nThe Policies\nI will fight to make sure that my mates are\nalright as regards piss-ups, parking permits,\netc. I feel that I would be able to work well with\nthe other sabbaticals; the people who are\nstanding are fairly random and so I should be\nable to dump all my work on them leaving me\nto get on with the real presidents job: getting\npissed, gate crashing parties and attending\nsundry other hoo lies. For a long time we have had Presidents who\nhave been elected on certain policies and then\ndone piss all about them. If you look at all the\ncandidates and all their promises I am sure you\nwill agree with me that there is only one\nchoice: ABSTAIN. Dep. President: PHILIP GREENSTREET proposed by Crispin Dobson\nWhy do I think that I would make a good DP?\nWell, I feel that I could deal well with all the\naspects of the post. I have a broad experience\nof running and sitting on committees, for as\nVice President of RCS I have sat on Finance\nCommittee, and handled estimates. I have a good working knowledge of the Union Building, and am well acquainted with the lock\nsystem employed within College.\nBut there should be more to being DP than\njust going through the work. You should be\ncapable and confident enough to de put is e for\nthe President when the need arises, able to\nraise interest in the Union amongst students,\nand able to communicate with those around\nyou.\nIn their campaigns, various people will tell\nyou how wonderfully militant they intend to be.\nThis is a ridiculous attitude to take. I don't intend to be pushed around by College or the\nextremes of student opinion, but if action is\nneeded I will take it.\nI intend to take ' Mike' to every Union Meeting, and hopefully one or two other items\nas well.\nMost of all, I want to know what the average\nstudent wants of the Union, and I shall do my\nutmost to find out.\nIf Simon Shaw's motion to make Deputy\nPresident in charge of IC Ents is passed, thus\nmaking Ents Officer a sabbatical, Iam confident that I can carry the post.\nI may not be the best man for the job, but\nI'm the best on offer.\nPhil Greenstreet\nDeputy President: JOHN WHITE proposed by Alan Edwards\nFirstly, if elected I would have to strive for a good working relationship with those people\naround me. especially the President, and Hon Sec. An uncoordinated Exec would be of little\nuse to anyone. Together with this and from my\nexperiences this year, I have found that one of\nthe most important, and essential functions of\nthe Deputy President is to be in the Union\nareas for a large amount of time \u2014 not only\nduring the daytime. Thus he would be more\ninformed about the Union fixtures and generally more likely to be able to deal quickly\nwith any problem which may arise. I propose\nto do this, having spent a lot of time in the\nUnion Building to date.\nI also propose to help the executives of each\nclub and society with the promotion of their\nactivities, as after all, this is the only contact\nmost students have with the Union. This will\ninvolve taking a close interest in all the major\nsubcommittees, and especially the financial\naffairs of clubs \u2014 through the subcommittees.\nThe Deputy President is responsible for the\nsecurity of the Union areas, and the safety of\nthose within it. I consider the security of the\nUnion Building especially, to be poor. A closer\ncheck will have to be kept on the whereabouts\nof keys, and possibly restricting the areas in\nwhich people may move, especially non-students using the Union facilities.\nJohn White\n\n"
