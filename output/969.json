So being a firm believer that every man (at\nleast) is a pervert no matter how\nlatent, who will at least be curious\nabout the subject I thumb my nose\nat what is expected of me in writing\nsuch an article, throw political\ncorrectness out of the window and\ncarry on in my own chosen way.\nYou can hardly have failed to\nnotice all the handouts found in\n'phone booths in the South\nKensington area advertising all sorts\nof carnal gratification. You may\neven have tried 'phoning one or two\nup for a giggle (or otherwise); but\nfor all of you who haven't, whether\nit's because you can't be arse d or\nyou're afraid, here is a guide of\nwhat you can expect.\nThe first woman I called (373\n1284) advertised herself as 'TVs\nFantasy Haven, Satin and Lace,\nFrocks and Frills, Wigs and High\nHeels' so I decided, rather than tell\nher I was researching for purely\njournalistic interests I would\npretend to be a punter.\n- ' Hi.I saw an advert of yours in\na phone booth in Chelsea...How\nmuch will it cost me?'\n- 'It depends what you want.'\n- 'Bondage, say.'\n- 'Forty pounds.'\n- 'What about humiliation?'\n- 'Thats the same thing...'\nAt this point the call girl was\nextremely s usp is cio us. How was I to know they were the same thing?\nThe word 'Physicist' is a synonym\n0 4 C,3 ft Schoolgirl type ii mM s strict headmaster for\nlessons z589H202 of 'naive'.\n- '...Where are you?'\n- 'Me? I'm at South Kensington.'\n- 'No you're not!'\nAt which point she hung up,\nwhich was a bit odd because it was\nthe only truthful thing I had said\nduring the entire conversation.\nAccording to a denizen of the Felix\noffice this may have been a ploy to\nmake sure that the caller is a serious\nprospective client rather than a joker or police officer; a call girl\nexpects a serious client to call back.\nThis may have been so but I was\nrather disgruntled at being rumbled\nand so I moved on to my next call.\nMy approach to 'Brand new\nstunning model' (938 3586) was\nmore honest.\n- 'Hi. My name is Phillip and I'm a freelance journalist researching\ncall girls. Is it possible to ask you\na few questions?'\n- 'Erm...er.. Hang on...'\nI heard her call another woman\nover and I asked her the same\nquestion. There was a few giggles\nshared by the two and it seemed that\nthey were far more embarrassed\nthan I was.\n- 'Erm.. sorry, love, we're a bit\nbusy at the moment...'\nAnd she hung up.\n'School girl type' (370 7696) was\nfar more co-operative and I was\nable to chat quite happily with her.\nThe first thing which struck me was\nthat, judging by her voice, no way\nwas she just out of school, unless\nshe was a teacher; she sounded as\nif she was in her forties. I was very\npleased when she agreed to answer\na few journalistic questions such\nas..\n- 'So, how much do you charge?'\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "News\nEx-Editor fires Student flees\nrace rumpus\nby Declan Curry\nDavid Irving, the controversial\nrevisionist historian and former\nPhoenix editor, took part in a meeting of neo-Nazis at Bromleyby-Bow last Saturday. The meeting\nis regarded as part of Mr Irving's campaign to build a new political\n'Christian Democrat' party in\nBritain.\nMr Irving was editor of Phoenix\nin 1958-9, but was sacked after\npublishing material regarded as\n'fascist'. Later that year, Mr Irving\npublished pro-apartheid articles in\na University of London publication\nof which he was editor. Mr Irving\nnow claims that the Nazi holocaust\nnever occurred, and is regarded by\nmany as a Nazi apologist. Recendy,\nin Canada; he said the only war\ncrime committed was the Allied\nbombing of Dresden.\nMr Irving is believed to be\nconnected with a body known as\n'The Clarendon Club'. An organisation monitoring neo-nazi\nactivity told Felix that the\nAn exhibition of art works by\nImperial students started yesterday,\nwrites Declan Curry. The artifacts\nare on display in the Consort\nGallery in the Sherfield Building.\nHoliday\nby Declan Curry\nThe Whitsun Bank Holiday has seen\nthe formation of a surprising flock\nof holidaymakers. Heading the\n'Wish You Were' trail is the\nRector, who will be in Hong Kong\n'on alumnus business' until 7th June. Keeping up his hectic\nlifestyle, he will fly out of the\ncountry again on 9th June. Louise\nClarke, erstwhile press officer for\nthe National Union of Students, is\nat an unknown destination this\nweek, as is her president, Lorna\nFitzsimons. Felix's own Jan Moore,\npress officer at the Department for\nClarendon Club is reported to be a collection of 'very right wing Tories\nand upper class Nazis'. A spokesman for Searchlight\nmagazine confirmed the existence\nof the Clarendon Club, but said that\nthey were 'marginal is ed in Britain'.\nA spokesman for the British\nNational Party told Felix to 'speak\nto Mr Irving'. When asked about\nthe Clarendon Club, the spokesman\nslammed down his telephone\nreceiver.\nThe Clarendon Club will hold a meeting in Brighton on 19 June. We\nare told that Mr Irving will attend\nthis meeting. David Irving was\nrecently refused an entry visa to\nAustralia. The Australian High\nCommission in London said that Mr\nIrving's 'presence was not\nconducive to the public good'. Mr\nIrving was deported from Canada\nlast November, and is banned from\nGermany, Austria, South Africa\nand Italy. He was also barred from\nspeaking at the Brentwood primary\nschool in Essex.\nThe exhibition, which includes\nworks from both the South\nKensington and Paddington\ncampuses, runs until 18 June.\ntrail\nEducation is en va can ceau ssi. Keeping the education connection,\nthe Shadow Education Secretary,\nAnn Taylor, is 'having a good time\nin France', according to a Labour\nParty spokesman. Felix editor,\nJonty Beavan, also took advantage\nof the long weekend to disappear\n'up north somewhere', but is now\nback in the office, writing up some\nfeature or other. At the time of\nwriting, Dominic Wilkinson was\nnot in his office. Cathy and\nMichelle, who claim never to have\ntaken a holiday in their lives, say\nthat Dom is 'away'.\nby Declan Curry\nThe missing Buckinghamshire\nstudent who fled to London after\nshe was expelled from her college\nhas been reunited with her family.\nSamantha Fox, 20, told parents Ann\nand Andrew that she had run off to\nLondon 'in a complete daze, and\nhadn'ta clue what to do.'\nDuring her nine day absence,\nSamantha lived at a bed-and-breakfast in Finsbury Park, in\nNorth London. She had been\nthrown off her computer sciences\nand modern languages course at\nSwansea last March after initially\nrunning into difficulties with\nby Declan Curry\nLondon Underground tried to\nensnare the Government this week,\nby handing the bill to the Prime\nMinister for one of his own ideas.\nDenis Tunnicliffe, Underground\nManaging Director, warned that\ntargets in the new Tube passengers'\ncharter 'could be affected' if the\nGovernment did not pay out money\nit had already promised. The\nbroadside came in the week when\nGovernment support for the\nCrossRail project was played off\nagainst promised finance for the\nJubilee line extension to East India\nDock. The Jubilee line extension\nwas only temporarily saved this\nweek by an eleventh hour deal\ncobbled together between the\nproject's bankers.\nThe comments were made at the\nlaunch of the new Underground\npassengers' charter, 'Aiming\nHigh'.

As the results came\nthrough on the slow boat to the\nFelix Office, it became clear that all\nposts had been filled with no\nvictories for the ever notorious New\nElection.\nFor the post of President, John\ncoursework. Samantha told\nreporters that, at times, 'it seemed\nthere was no-one to turn to', and\nclaimed that there was a six month\nwaiting list for counselling, an\nallegation furiously denied by\nSwansea.\nThe National Union of Students\nsays the case shows the 'continuing\nstress' students are under. Samantha\nhas urged other students in\ndifficulty to seek help immediately.\nThe Imperial College student\ncounsellor, Don Adlington, is\navailable to see students at his office\nin 15 Prince's Gardens, or can be\ntelephoned on 3041.\nimprove on targets set out in last\nyear's charter. Under the new\ntargets, 86% of customers should\nbe satisfied with trains and 81%\nwith stations, while 89% of Tube\nusers should be satisfied with station\ncleanliness. Customer satisfaction\nwith staff should rise by 1% to\n86%. London Transport hopes to\nrun the same proportion of trains at\npeak times, and says that 95% of\ntrains should keep to the timetable.\nA new refund scheme will be\nintroduced at the end of 1993, with\ncustomers receiving compensation\nfor delays of more than 15 minutes.\n28,000 refund claims were paid out\nlast year for delays of more than 20\nminutes, costing London\nUnderground \u00a368,000. Mr Tunnicliffe said that the charter\n'was about delivering a service that\nwould make refunds an exception\nrather than a rule. Last year's performance has vindicated this.'\nMcCall, a Geology student, was the\nclear winner, Omar Khier from\nMaterials triumphed in the close\nbattle for Vice President of the\nUnion. The final post of Honorary\nSecretary was handed on a plate to\nCharlie Holgate in an unopposed\ncontest.\nThe whole election was run on\nthe Single Transferable vote\nsystem, in common with all\nImperial College Union elections,\nand was organised by the steady\nhand of current R SMU Vice\nPresident Boris Pluskowski.\nSt Marys' art\non display\nTube Charter\nMines Results\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nExhibition\nWell, there's good, bad and ugly.\nAnd if you want to see the last two\nof these, go over to the Whitechapel\nGallery. Out in the crumbling lands\nbeyond the bomb-shattered golden\ntowers of the city, lies a small\ntemple dedicated to modern art. The\ngallery is a beautiful creation of\nlight and space, which one would\nthink would enhance any exhibition.\nUnfortunately, the art on display\ndoes not do it justice. The Ugly is\nTony Bevan. His paintings are\nportraits and hands, emphasising\nonly the surface unpleasantness. He\nuses lurid red and orange\nbackgrounds to surround his lumpy,\nfleshy renditions of people, in a style reminiscent of the Late Great\nFrancis Bacon. Bevan's pictures,\nhowever, are worthless in\ncomparison.\nHis faces and hands are painted\nwith deft, expressionist strokes of\nthe brush, enhancing distorted\nfeatures and the wrinkled folds in\nFelix 969\nthe skin, emphasising the bodily\nnature of the human. Somewhat\nincongruously the rest of the picture\nis almost abstract, with hair reduced\nto snaking black lines around the\nfeatures and backgrounds reduced\nto suicidal black and crimson. The\nfaces stare out at the viewer with a mixture of blankness and\nin comprehension. The artist has\nsomehow removed all life from his\nsubjects- This may have been\npurposeful, but it only seems to\nemphasize a lack of technical\nability. His main picture, \"The\nMeeting\" (Most of the other\nexhibited works are studies for this\none) says it all. A large collection\nof canvasses depicting lumpy,\nvacant old men with their mouths\nopen. One feels that they must be\nyawning with boredom or laughing\nin derision. I certainly felt like\ndoing both. Bevan's work is nothing\nnew? it's just a mixture of styles\nused by other artists recently. He\nuses none of the techniques well,\nand the result is instantly\nforgettable.\nThe Bad is Piotr Nathan. His\nexhibits are 'installation works',\nworks designed specifically for a particular gallery. He is the epitome\nof all that is wrong with\ncontemporary art. Using cheap\nmethods to shock the viewer (urine\nstains) and obvious political\nstatements, his work is full of the\nmindless pretension that gives art a bad name. Take, for instance, the\nlarge collection of plaster casts of\nbullet holes in walls. The title is\n\"The outline of the place that was\nbombed in the last days of the war\nfollows the contour of a urine mark\nthat emerged on the mattress of a person dying from aids.\". Need I say more?\nIf you feel like seeing some good\ncontemporary art then don't go to\nthe Whitechapel Gallery. It seems\na shame that, while there are many\npotentially good artists in this\nworld, the ones who achieve\nacclaim are the ones who produce\nsuch po in des s work. Nobody really\nappreciates this stuff apart from the\nsmall, narcissistic group of\nfollowers who also enjoy pissing on\nsheets and calling it' 'Art''. No one\nelse would, they would only laugh\nor sigh (like me). And, if they want\nto make some world shattering\npolitical statement, then they should\neither learn to write or learn to paint\nreal, powerful pictures\u2014after all,\nPicasso did, and his \"Guernica\" is\nstill a powerful and motivating as\nit was in the thirties. I doubt that this\nexhibition will be remembered in a month, and I hope it isn't.M. A. \u2022 Tony Bevan/Piotr Nathan\nWhitechapel \" Art\" Gallery,\nWhitechapel High st.

ICSO's wind\nsoloists were the icing on the cake;\nJames Layland's flute solo in the\nDebussy Prelude had one\nrummaging in the adjectives box for\nexpressions such as mellifluous,\ndiaphanous, and that useful word\nmeaning 'with interestingly\nsuggestive fruity bits in it' that slips\nmy mind just at the moment.\nClarinets, solo flute and cor anglais\nalso shone in the Falla.\nIt was good to hear an IC\nperformer in the concerto item, and\nrefreshing that Stephen Tarlton\nshould choose with the Ravel G major piano concerto to stray a little\nfrom the well-beaten path trodden\nby recent soloists. Fresh and jazzy\nin the outer movements, lyrical in\nthe central Adagio, it's a lovely\npiece, especially when played as\nwell as it was here.\nPain Of Youth Despite the title, this play started\nout on a lively and sarcastic note\nand looked quite promising. On the\nway home however, instead of\nboarding the tube, I was strongly\ntempted to throw myself under it.\nPortraying the possible pain\nexperienced in late youth (ie late\nteens), this play graphically and\npowerfully gives a feel of what life\nmay be like for us young people.\nLines like '...you might as well\nkill yourself when your\nseventeen...' drown the humour\nsome what and give you that\nsuicidal feeling.\nThe final work was Britten's Young Person's Guide to the\nOrchestra, which spotlights each\nsection in turn. Highlights were\nAndrew Miller's faultless oboe\nplaying, the excellent horn section,\nand a jaunty xylophone solo.\nConductor Richard Dickins, who\nhad prepared this varied and\nchallenging programme over a shorter period than usual, was\nrecalled several times to the\npodium, and welcomed each time\nwith obvious enthusiasm by\norchestra and audience alike.\nTitus Drum.\nAll luv vies and darlings were\nborn for the roles, especially the\ncharacters of old man, Alt and the\nbaby faced Petrell, and the set, I thought, could be one of the best at\na fringe theatre that I have ever\nseen.>\nThis play speaks volumes for\ntodays youth and is worth seeing.\nDon't expect to laugh, but expect\nto watch a remarkable play, all be\nit on the depressing side.\nHard Harry\n\u2022 Grace Theatre (above The\nLatchmere Pub), Latchmere Rd,\nBus 49 from South Kensington\nTube Stn., Mon-Sat 8pm.

He will\nalso enter the annals of history as\nthe minister who lamented the latest\nrise in the unemployment figures on\nthe day that unemployment fell for\nthe first time in under three years.\nBy comparison, Mr Davis seems\nto have had a rather dull political\nupbringing, being Parliamentary\nPrivate Secretary (unpaid skivvy) to\nFrancis Maude during 1990.

Of more relevance was the\nfact that the snapping condom had\nsprayed oil based lubricant all over\nthe place. The tables, chairs and\nspectators of this strange condom\nstretching event were now proud\nowners of freshly deposited\n'lubricant'.\nAfter clearing up a little, the\nassembled observers decided that\nthis was not very good test. As all\nthe parts had been supplied by KY Jelly and cutting the condom in hall f might have effected the results of\nthe test. Such are the trails of\nplaying a game with any scientist,\nthey take it all so seriously. It was\ndecided that we should get some\nmore condoms and repeat the event.\nSo off I went to search Imperial\nCollege Union Building for more\nfodder for our latex protection tests.\nStrangely, all the mens toilets were\ncompletely devoid of condoms. One\nempty machine lay outside the\nconveniences looking like it been\nripped off the wall. I was depressed,\nif I was about to have sex, I would\nbe near hysteria by now. There was\none last hope, a female friend\noffered to go into the Ladies toilets\nand buy a packet of three from\nthere. Strange place Imperial, you\ncan't buy condoms if you're a man,\nbut you can if you're a woman.\nWhen she returned, she cast a knowing wink in my direction. I started to explain, then realised that\nif I were her, I wouldn't believe me\neither.\nReturning to examine the contents\nof the packet, our panel of judges\ndiscovered one Strawberry and two\n'Cock'tail flavour Mates condoms.\nWe decided that strawberry was far\ntoo queer so it would have to be the\nmanly 'Cock'tail that was put under\nthe strain. Again these were tested\nrigorously for the fragrance: We\ncame to the considered conclusion\nit was the aroma of Juicy Fruits with\na touch of rubber that would\nfragrance our simulated love\nmaking test.\nAfter another session of\nsmothering condoms with grease,\nwe sat for one hundred and twenty\nseconds dripping with the various\noils that had been scattered about.\nThe table began to look like it had\nbeen the lard y bathing place for\nsome Northerner. Stretching the\ncondoms was considered a poor\nThe KYJelly tester pack: A condom,\nsome Jelly, some instructions and\na dod gy looking bottle\nguide, so we tried to insert a hand\nas far in to the sheath as possible.\nI took the oil soaked one, Donny the\nKY covered version, and almost as\nsoon as my hand slid in, the condom\nsplit. Donny managed to put his\nentire fist and half his arm in to the\nrubber casing before it gave way.\nIt may have been the 'Cock'tail\nflavour, but it unnerved me that the\noil based one broke so easily.\nEvery one around the table had\nused condoms, but none admitted\never using a lubricant. A bit of a waste, as no one directly concerned\nby the rotting condoms was able to\ncomment on the test. One Student\nUnion President did say ' KY Jelly\nis the one I use every time'. But,\nfor all you people who decide to\nplay around with the Baby Oil, its\nbetter to use a water based lubricant\njust in case some gets on your\nchosen method of protection.\nSo back to Maxine, who\nincidentally is one of the people\nemployed to promote KY Jelly at\nRed Rooster PR:\n'...

    "content": "opinion\n4 June 1993\nKate, I love you\nFelix 969\nDear Jonty,\nIt was suggested by a disrespectful bunch of young snots\nthat I should be run over by the bus.\nWhich bus? The no. 10, no. 29 or\nSarah Welsh? They don't have a clue about managing to get up in the\nmorning, let alone running events\nthat people want to go to. They\ndon't seem to recognise\nachievement or commitment to\nboot.\nPerhaps this is why they snubbed\ntheir own Honorary Senior\nTreasurer Dr Paul Ewing by not\neven awarding him Colours, full or\nhalf which most people seem to get\nfor walking through the union office\ndoor nowadays. In addition, Dr\nShaun Crofton, Mr Colin Rogers\nand Mr John Impey have all put in\nconsiderable amounts of time and\neffort into helping the Union out\nand received no thanks. This is both\ninsulting and completely\nunacceptable.\nI noted with interest that the\nyoung snots managed to award\nthemselves, but then again it's probably the only chance they'll get\nto put an honour on their CV. So far this year the Freshers'\nWeek event was poorly attended,\nthe Boat Party was cancelled, the\nCareers talks got little interest and\nIce Skating couldn't muster up a group discount. The Pub Pursuits\ngot little interest, the second one\nwas in fact cancelled. The Disaster\nand Dance lost money and 35%\nfewer people attended than in\nprevious years. Speaking of\ndisasters, the May Ball was\ncancelled before it could become a disaster.\nThe more astute readers will\nnotice the absence of the Guilds\nBrighton run. From the above list.\nIt did happen but it was organised\nby the Motor Club. The Hotel was\npacked out and the event made a profit, which Guilds kept. The\nhiring of a Motor racing circuit\nmade so much money it paid for the\ncoming trip outright. The other\nMotor Club dinners did not lose a penny either so it would appear that\nthe C&G Motor Club know what\nthey're doing and that there are a fair few incompetents d is organising Guilds and wasting student money.\nThis probably goes some way to\nexplaining why they view the Motor\nClub and its officers with contempt,\nof which I am one.\nI sincerely hope the new Guilds\nexec can build on the success of\nevents they organised for the 'year\nin industry' students and not make\nthe mistakes that many of this year's exec have. Then again, it's barely\nsurprising when the numbers are\nmade up with a coke head and an\nincompetent.\nYours sincerely,\nGavin JR Pearson, Mech Eng 3.\nWhat is the meaning of truth\nDear Jonty,\nA few quick points. It's good to\nsee Owain is back, and as witty as\never. Phil's column is maintaining\nits bite and drawing blood, and he's making a good fist of some other\nsections as well. Others will only\nget big headed, but there's a definite\nwhiff of improvement. Well done,\nSir.\nI'm also delighted to see the\nresponse to recent news articles. At\nlast, life... Thanks to Bruce\nCartwright in Beit for some solid\npoints, and to Jim Bichard in\nBiology.\nJim is, of course, correct in his\nwell crafted letter. The Times\nleague tables are regarded as\nimportant in some sectors, but they\nare not as important, or indeed as\nsignificant, as they are made out to\nbe. In the main, it's a fair cop.\n'Jingoism' is a fair word to use in\ndescribing my earlier article. Why\nwas it written? Why was it run?\nFelix is not as editorially\nindependent as we would like to\nthink it is. The Union General\nManager asks for a staff protocol,\nso try not to name them. The Union\nPresident insists we toe the party\nline, but then Chris has real\nproblems with freedom, democracy\nand the like. College management\n'request' we print good news, so we\ndo, as by some perversion they\nmight control our funding in a few\nmonths. The Rector threatens us\nwhen we write about the Governing\nBody. One Governor mentioned\nlibel, once.\nPerhaps we should change our\nname. Pravda has a truthful ring to\nit, if nothing else\nA few pettifogging details,\nthough. The comments about Rag\nwere a touch unfair. The success of\nthe boat club was and is well\ncharted on these pages. Jonty did\nnot interfere in the writing of the\nTimes story.\nI'm glad Jim had the courage to\nanswer back. Not many do.\nSometimes, I doubt if we have that\ncourage.\nDeclan Curry,\noutsider, pissing in.\ntog*.*.\nBilled beyond belief\nDear Jonty,\nYesterday I received a letter in\nmy hall pigeonhole (notice bly ten\ndays after the letter was dated)\nwhich claimed I had not paid my\nac como dati on bill. This threatened\n\"I would remind you that you are\nnow incurring penalty charges at the\nrate of \u00a31 per day If you do\nnothing about this letter you will\nonly put yourself deeper into debt''.\nThis was in fact incorrect. My\nbill was paid on 19th May 1993 and\nI still have the re cie pt and switch\nre cie pt to prove this.\nPerhaps the ac como dati on offices\nenergies could be better spent\nchasing up unpaid bills and those of\npersistent non-payers as highlighted\nin the letters page of Felix 967.\nYours sincerely,\nDuncan Austin\nI love you too Gavin\nDear Jonty,\nI have heard rumours, ill-founded\nthey may be (but I doubt it), that a certain Mr G JR Pearson is having\na sense of humour failure with the\n'so long as he gets run over by the\nbus' comment (Felix 968). I have\nbeen led to believe that he is\nretail i a ting with a vicious attack on\nthe Guilds Exec of 92-93. What a shame. I am devastated. As, I am\nsure, are the rest of the Guilds\nExec, as we all know full well that\nhe is, as usual, full of uninteresting,\nmundane, destructive criticism that\nwe have all heard before. If any\nFelix reader wishes to know of\nGavin's personal gripes against the\nUnion, then please, come and talk\nto me and I will personally\nintroduce you to him. I am sure that\nI will have a queue at my door\nsaying 'Please, please I want to talk\nto Gav, he sounds so interesting'.\nI am told, on good authority, that\nour dear Gav thinks that myself,\nand Sarah Welsh (C& GCU Hon\nSec) wrote the 'so long as he gets\nrun over by the bus' statement,\nhence the retaliation. Gavin, you\nare wrong.\nAs Guilds president this year, I have had to listen to Mr G JR Pearson's constant loud\ncommentary on the Union. All year, I don't believe I have heard\na single piece of constructive\ncriticism pass his lips. In fact, when\npressed, all he could come up with\nwas 'Get a life\u2014join the Motor\nClub'. Hrnmmm. Very useful.\nI hope I am not insulting the\nintelligence of the Felix readership\nto suggest that, just maybe, Mr Perason is not just suffering from\na severe case of sense of humour\nfailure, but also a delusion of\nself-importance.\nAs I do not wish to have a 'letter\nfor letter' war in the pages of Felix\nwith Mr Pearson, I do hope that this\nwill be the end of the matter.\nHowever, I doubt this very much,\nas I have great faith in the literary\ngenius of said Mr G JR Pearson,\nto come up with something equally\ninteresting and stimulating for your\nreaders in future issues of Felix. I will however guarantee that this will\nbe my ONLY and last input into this\nargument.\nAs a footnote, I would like to\nadd, that if anyone, anywhere, has\nany serious and constructive\ncriticism about Guilds or the\ngeneral running of aCC U, please\ndo not hesitate to contact me, or any\nof the Exec, in the Guilds Office,\nRm 340, Mech Eng.\nYours sincerely,\nKute Dalton,\nPresident C& GCU (92-93)\nage 6\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nDramSoc\nCan't Pay Won't Pay\nDario Fo's unique blend of farce\nand acute political comment found\nfresh and vivid expression in\nImperial College Dramsoc's production of 'Can't Pay Won't Pay\n!'. Although this form of theatre\nstrives to stir an audience's sense of\nthe injustices in life, it never adopts\nan intimidating tone.\nOn the contrary, the plot\nresembles a bizarre sit-com that\nspirals wildly out of control, with\nbewildering and hilarious\nconsequences. Or, rather, an\nepisode of 'The Flintstones'; where\nWilma and Betty have taken part in\na riot against unfair increases in\nprices down at the local\n'Drugastoraus', coming home laden\nwith their spoils. How will they\nexplain this to their husbands....?\nThe cast of five, after a tentative\nbeginning, threw themselves with\nfearless abandon into their parts.\nMartin Pye's Giovanni ('Fred') was\ndiabolically self-righteous in his\nnaivety and admirably sustained the\nmany lengthy monologues. While\nMancy Amin's Antonia ('Wilma')\ndisplayed perfect poise amid the\nchaos unfolding about her.\nThe second couple ('The\nRubbles') were given strong\nperformances by Catherine Pope\nand Richard Ford. But the star of\nthe evening for me, and it seemed\nthe rest of the audience, was\nStephan Kannengieber. His\ndepictions of those in authority\n(there was a breathless array of no\nless than four characters,\ndistinguished only by facial hair and\ndiffering head wear. Thankfully the\naccent remained constant!) as\n'creatures of habit with no brain',\nwas aided by an accent that seemed\nto span the Atlantic - lying\nsomewhere between Germany and\nAmerica. He brought a strange,\nother-worldly quality to his lines:\nNot quite how Fo may have\nenvisaged it, but great fun\nnevertheless!\nFinally, a word about the\nproduction. The spontaneity of the\naction did not always seem the\nresult of fore-thought, but was\nconstantly entertaining; bicycles\nridden through the audience, bellies\nbeing blown up...\nAltogether, a conception and\nevening not easily forgotten!\nI QQ Y The Cabinet of Dr Caligari\nAlthough it had started off with a half hour delay, the play was very\npromising from its beginning.\nEverything was there, a very\ninteresting story adapted from the\nmuch revered Wiene's classic\nexpressionist film, relatively good\nacting, appropriate music and full\naudience. It looked like mysterious\nDr Caligari and his somnambulist\nCesare would take us, breathlessly\nto the world of mesmerism, horror\nand depravity.\nHowever, as the play progressed\nit revealed all possible mistakes in\nstage managing, order of cast\nappearances and changing stage\nsettings. Girls doing curtains could\nnot agree whether they had to open\nor close them. From time to time\nactors would appear from corners\nwondering was it their turn to say\nsomething. Although the stage itself\nwas relatively simple, four to five\nobjects in maximum, it took them\nages to change things and make\nready for the next scene. The\naudience had to sit in the dark for\nan unacceptably long time, forced\nto listen to all sorts of noise behind\nthe curtains (luckily no swear\nwords).\nIt was a great pity that all these,\nalthough important, but still only\nsupporting things spoiled the whole\nartistic feeling of the play itself. Dr\nCaligari (Harry Gendryes) was very\ngood. With that horrible grimace on\nhis face (which must be very\ndifficult to maintain for an hour or\nso, I suppose) seemed like someone\nwho really knew something about\nmesmerism and all those dark and\nsecret things. Producer and director\nMaria Holzamer was on a right way\nin adopting expressionist style and\npan to mimic acting from the original\nfilm which was a major\nbreakthrough for Art cinema in the\n1920s. If they had another week or two\nfor rehearsing, this might be a remarkable play. If you still want\nto give them a chance, wait for\nanother ten days or so (play is on\nuntil 13 June), they might improve\nby that time, otherwise don't waste\nyour time.\nElena.\n\u2022 The Courtyard Theatre Club,\n10 York Way, Kings Cross.

In it Shakespeare\npresents a fine picture of Eastern\nopulence and Roman pride. Eight\nyar s earlier he had written 'Julius\nCaeser' and there the rivals, Antony\nand Octavias, appear as comrades.\nIn that play the critical clash of\ncares is between Antony and\nBrutus;the man of action and the\nidealist. The tragedy is the soul's tragedy of Brutus. Through this\nShakespeare passed to the writing\nof the four great tragedies, all of\nwhich are concerned with the world\nwithin, the self- torturing soul. In\n'Antony and Cleopatra' he returns\nto the world of great affairs and\npr sent s us with a play of action and\naction that spans the whole range of\nthe Roman Empire. Here we are\nwitness to the full fall and\nfrustration of Antony, once the\n'Jupitar of men...the day of the\nworld...the lord of lords'.\nThe play, in it's meaning,\nstructure and character is ation is\nvery complicated and has given rise\nto a bewildering variety of\ninterpretations; most of which have\ntended to run to extremes either of\ndenunciation or glorification of the\nlovers. In this charming production\nAnthony...\nDanny Boy This black comedy is set in\nNorthern Ireland and the\nunbelievable plot is that Danny is\nvisited one day by the Angel\nGabriel. I know it sounds weird, but\nwhat's weirder is that his parents\nare named Mary and Joseph? The\ncharacters are hardly original, are\nthey!\nDanny then becomes Christ in\nUlster and begins to perform all\nsorts of miracles, again borrowed\nfrom someone else s life story.\nThe comedy is really funny and\nthe one liners are un li kle anything\nthat I have ever heard. But the\nproduction doesn't do the humour\nany favours and can dampen things\na bit.\nThe last play(s) that the Etcetera\nwrote or produced or whatever\nwere nominated for fringe theatre\n4 June 1993\nat the Barbican,John Caird has\nchallenging ly retained something of\nthe significance of the text by\nsimplifying nothing. The play opens\nwith Antony languishing in the land\nof the Pharohs. As the house- lights\nfade the air is filled with a faint\nfragrance of perfume, the caressing,\nclean aroma of luxury and\nopulence. On the instant Egypt\nseemed to reach out and seduce, as\nit's Queen had the pillars of the\nworld.\nClare Higgins played Cleopatra\nwith all the appropriate haugh ter, vol up to us appeal and fickle tyranny.\nWhile Richard Johnson's Antony\nwas a great titan in decline, tottering\nabout the stage he swiftly acc ended the scale of suffering, to\nun soundness at the end. Both\nbreathed vividly amid the\ndispassionate correctness of all\nabout.\nWith such flawed characters as\nAntony and Cleopatra it is difficult\nto excite close sympathy, but it is\na measure of the success of this\nproduction that it' inspired very\npo we ful emo tins.

    "content": "Close them down\nDear Jonty,\nLast week I decided it was time\nI contributed a letter to Felix rather\nthan just sitting on my arse and\nreading it. I had actually intended\nto write a reply to the worthless\ndrivel written about Mr. Pearson by\nour wonderfully competent,\nfriendly and efficient Shitty and\nGuilds office. I do, incidentally\nhope and believe that our next\nyear's exec, mess rs Griffith,\nBaguley etc. will turn this farce\naround. However, today I found a better and more worthwhile subject\nabout which to moan.\nOn my way home I use\nGloucester road tube station, only\nthis time it was a little more\ndifficult. Due (I was told by the\nstation manager) to recent\ngovernment decisions to\n'rational is e' our underground\nsystem and reduce running costs by\nsacking 5000 staff and then\nexpecting the system to continue\nservice normally, the ticket office\nwas closed, not temporarily but for\nthe whole day as there were simply\nno staff to man it. The alternative\nwas the automatic ticket machines,\nwell known for reliability and their\nOkay, I admit it. There is more than\na whiff of Jon Ronson's Time Out\ncolumn to my good old 'Slice of\nLife'. A strange coincidence?\nActually I met Jon at a go-cart\nconvention in Merthyr Tydfil some\nthree years ago. I can't recall\nexactly how we got talking, as I remember I saw his feet sticking out\nfrom under the chassis and we just\nbegan from there.\nWe got talking about writing and\njournalism, hitting upon an\nunbeatable concept. A weekly\nfeature packed full of misogynist\nbigotry and slanted observation that\nwould leave no nut case un cracked. Afterwards he grew cynical and\ntook the concept to Time Out,\nachieving fame and fortune as\n'Columnist of the Year' whilst I mellowed and wrote poems about\nold ladies and their laundry buckets.\nAm I jealous? Hell no\u2014you see\nwhereas Jon can only point and\nlaugh at all the wacky crazies out\nthere I 've the advantage that I am\none of those wacky crazies! It's true\nI don't fight for the rights of kitchen\nappliances nor do I hold wedding\nservices for sensitive men with\nponytails and consenting cuddly\nrodents. However I do read The\ninfrequent use of the ' EXACT MONEY ONLY' legend. These\nwere of course virtually inoperative\nas they had no change and were not\naccepting 50P or \u00a31 coins as the\ncollection bins were full. As I did\nnot happen to have 26 10P coins on\nme for a travelcard, silly me, I was\nforced to travel without a ticket,\nprime fodder for a prowling ticket\ninspector. As a regular paying\ncustomer I object to having to travel\nwithout a ticket. To register my\ncomplaint I had the station manager\ngive me the 'phone number of a Mr.\nNick Agnew, District line general\nmanager, amazingly enough when\nI rang at 4 o 'clock there was nobody\nin the office but if I would like to\nleave a message.... Perhaps a good\ncost cutting measure was deemed to\nbe sacking all the staff customers\ncould complain to, and thus cut the\nnumber of dissatisfied customers at\na stroke!\nIt would seem then that Mr. Major is going to work the usual\nConservative party magic on our\nunderground system and turn it into\nan underfunded collapsing system\n(just like higher education really) or\nis he just going to make it profitable\nGuardian and quite frankly, for Jon,\nthat's qualification enough.\nSaturday morning, the 'Islington\nGreen Fair'. I'm there in my role\nas carer and Earth-Saver (and thus\nlunatic), selling 'Fair Trade' coffee\nto the masses. For the puzzled 'Fair\nTrade' basically involves giving\nsome money to the people who\ngrow the goods, rather than merely\ngiving money to large plantation\ncorporations to spend bashing up\nthose who actually grow the goods.\nIt began badly enough, my\npartner in righteous crime, Mark,\ngets hit for a forty quid parking\nticket after Neil, a thirty something\nWppy-thing, advises him to shift the\ncar over to a loading area outside\nhis Oxfam shop. Neil is the kind of\nguy who believes we should all\ncommute to work on organically fed\nfamily sized Yaks (oh yes), so quite\nwhy Mark listened to him remains\na bone (well, we're all veggies, a baked bean...) of contention. But as\nI always say, if you can't trust a hippy who can you buy your Hash\nfrom?\nWe load up on coffee,\npromotional material and a curious\ngame constructed out of doorbells.\nThis consists of a range of questions\nenough to sell off, so that the well\nheeled who fund his election\ncampaigns can make more money\nat our expense.\nThe latter part of this letter is a personal view of the situation, not\na statement of fact and as such is not\nintended to provoke response from\nour, no doubt, large contingent of\nwith corresponding possible\nanswers, each answer coupled with\na button. Pressing the wrong\nanswer produces an infuriating\nbuzz, pressing the correct button an\ninfuriating bell. A better design\nwould wire the buttons to the\ngenitals of the participant. Any\ncurious corporate scum trying out\nthe game would be far more likely\nto remember that the answer to\n'How many people will die fighting\nfor democracy this year?' is not\n'Who cares provided we're selling\nthem the hardware' if it was\naccompanied by the smell of char-grilled flesh below.\nAt the green our first task is to\nobtain a stall. We find the 'funny\nlittle man in tweed trousers and\nDM's and he gives us a choice. We\ncan take the empty spot next to the\n'Karma and Spiritual Commodities\nCompany' or the 'Animal Rights'\npeople. I couldn't stand the thought\nof spending the day watching\ndisciples buying plastic buddha\nshaped key rings to deposit their\ndying soul inside so we choose the\nlatter. The table over fo ws with\nslogans, some decent enough, some\nseemingly a little mad\u2014'Fish is\nSuicide' leaflets and 'Nits have\nfeelings too' t shirts.\nWe set up, begin to explain our\ncase and sell our coffee.

Mark\nbegins making wisecracks,\nsuggesting to the animal rights man\nthat he go liberate the rabbit\nresiding in an Islington City Farm\npromoters dungarees. There is only\none choice.\nWe abandon being right on and\nverily assault the crowd. I rush out\nwith a pile of promotional leaflets,\njumping in the way of hapless\npassers-by and railroading them to\nour stall. At the stall Mark\nshamelessly convinces them that it's buy the coffee or take the first flight\nto the fires below. We're cash\nhungry pimps, preying on\ninsecurities. The money comes in\nthick, sticky and fast. For a moment\nwe consider slipping some\ntimeshare sales in there but\ns a in dines s wins over in the end.\nThe people are told, the coffee is\nsold.

That the United Kingdom\nhas portrayed a somewhat\nexaggerated sense of nobility in\ninternational circles is almost\ncertainly true. Even British failures\nare ascribed a peculiar heroism.\nRobert Falcon Scott and Roald\nAmundsen, in their race for the\npole, are examples of such\nhistorical treatment; Scott, beaten,\ndoes not outlive his failure, dying\nheroically in the inhospitable wastes\nof antarctica. Amundsen,\nsuccessful, lives until a fateful\nexpedition in 1928. British history\nhas periodically portrayed him as\nclinical, Germanic, soulless.\nAnother example of sense of\nhumour failure, inhuman\nefficiency, and being first with the\nbeach towels. While I may be\naccused of anti-nationalist\npropaganda or, god forbid,\ncosmopolitan sympathies, it is\nstriking, is it not, how romantically\nwe view our role in the international\ncommunity.\nOr did. In the forty years since\nthe coronation of Her Majesty\nQueen Elizabeth II, the British\nperspective of itself has changed a little; that is to say it doesn't look\ndirectly at itself anymore, although\nit is only our own history\npersuading us that it ever did. As\na people, again, we demonstrate\nourselves to have some small talent\nfor ascribing our motives to the\nactions of others, and then\ncondemning them for it, c.f. Maastricht, and media inferences\nregarding the would-be\nmachinations of those in Brussels\n(buzzwords include 'potty',\n'b army', and 'Euro-bureaucrats').\nExpect jingoistic cartoon strips, and\nchildren's fiction to uphold the\nBritish Way, salute the flag, warm\nthe pants of those ball y jack an apes from Berlin, Belgium, Bratislava...\nTo the process of self-examination:\nIf the forty-year reign of one\nmonarch does not provoke a retrospective scrutiny, then nothing\nwill. Failing that, I suppose the\nBicentenary of the United Kingdom\nin 2003 may encourage a little navel\ncontemplation.\nEight years from the war, the surviving colonial advances in\nfoundations of the welfare state set 1993, there is Australia, whose\nmmm mi^ by the 1945 Labour Government\nwell in place, and into Churchill's second term of office. Stalin's death\nspared us another war and no small\nembarrassment, Korea was an\nunfortunate aside of which we had\nlittle involvement, but we were\nprime minister, Paul Keating,\nmakes public demands for\nAustralian independence, and\nfamiliar gestures (a caress here, a stroke there) to the head of state.\nThen there is Northern Ireland.\nEnough said. Even Scotland cries\nbusy anyway, conscripting young\nmen to conduct nuclear weapons\ntesting out in the pacific. We were\nbusy elsewhere, too, seceding vast\nareas of land back to its original\nowners, after having been\nresponsible for little or no\nimprovement. Of the UK' s sole\nout for devolution from\nWestminster, and what precisely\ndoes European Union mean when\nour Government quite evidently has\ngoals differing from those of our\nneighbours? John Donne's famous\n'No man is an island' utterance is\nlooking increasingly in need of the\ncodicil 'Unless the island is me.'\nAnd there's new music on the\nstreets; an underground tune that\nwas sung throughout the 1920s and\n1930s, remixed for the 90s. Ever\nsince the first influx to Britain of\ncoloured immigrants in the fifties,\nthrough the exodus of Indians,\nPakistanis, Bangladeshis, and\nUgandan asians forced out by Idi\nAmin in the sixties and seventies,\nculminating in the Vietnamese and\nHong Kong refugees taking up the\nlast decade. Europe-wide, the\nswagger, the jackboot, the very\nshort haircut, and the crooked\nattitude worn on the sleeve, are\nmaking their resurgence. In Britain,\nTory Nationalists, from Enoch\nPowell to his disgraced acolyte,\nHarvey Proctor, have campaigned\nvociferously for repatriation.\nProctor's own concern, the rightwing Monday Club, provoked mass\nhysteria in 1984 when it was\nrevealed to have been in f dt rated by\nfascists. The British record on race\nrelations reveals many sensitive\nareas; Viraj Mendis, forced to take\nsanctuary in a Manchester church\nto avoid deportation to Sri Lanka,\nthe Tamil refugees stripping naked\nat Heathrow for the same reason,\nthe fur ore caused by Dr Siddiqui\nand the Muslim Parliament, and the\nargument between religion and law\nover Salman Rushdie's novel 'The\nSatanic Verses'. Book-burning,\nfollowed by a holy fatwa from the\nIranian Imam, followed by the\nsupport of Yusuf Islam, followed by\nrecord-burning. Organisations such\nas the British National Party,\nNational Front, Combat 18 etc,\nhave capitalised on this\ndissatisfaction and are making\nsubstantial progress in recruiting the\ndispossessed and the\ndisenfranchised of British youth.\nThere is no shortage of those\nwilling to be foot soldiers for the\nnew Right, replacing the Horst\nWessels of the twenties with the\nKevins, the Brians, and the Darrens\nof the nineties. It seems a rising\nnumber of what we might call\n'ethnic Britons' are none too happy\nwith this island's current state of\ncultural diversity.\nAnd then we have the island\nitself, this 'precious jewel set in a silver sea' guarding itself 'against\nPage 12\n\n"

This\nyear's Best Picture, it also won Best\nDirector for Clint Eastwood, and\nGene Hackman took Best\nSupporting Actor for his\nperformance as the brutal sheriff in\nthis Western must-see.

Modern\nwesterns rarely come along these\ndays, and never as good as this one.\nEven if you're not a fan of cowboy\nmovies, this one is excellent\nbe a cuse of its acting but particularly\nbeautiful scenery and final\ncinematography. Whether you're a fan of Eastwood or not you should\nfind this film very enjoyable.\nUnforgiven screens at 7.30pm, next\nThursday, in the Union Concert\nHall, and don't forget Da Vinci's Happy Hour immediately before it\nto make the evening even better.\nThat's it for FilmSoc this\nyear...and what a year it's been.\nThanks for coming along, and if\nyou're here next year, make sure\nyou're among the first to see one of\nour 35mm shows with our new\nprojection equipment.

We were\ndeceived into coming here\u2014\nobviously everyone wants to leave\nuniversity at the end of three or four\nyears with an Imperial degree and\ngood job prospects. But at what\ncost? Isn't university meant to be\nthe best years of your life? Good\ntimes all the time, the romance of\nliving on a shoe-string, taxpayers\nfooting the bill for all-night parties\nand all-day sleeping. The reality is\nsomewhat more prosaic 'a preponderance of grey scientists' to\nparaphrase one student guide,\n'sensible shoes and anoraks abound'\nto quote another. But heh, we're in\nLondon, and 'life's what you make\nof it'. Now correct me if I'm wrong\nbut that's a load of bollocks. These\nare the guys (no sexism there, you\nknow the ratio) that you have to\nhang around with all day. College\ndominates your life, especially at\nIC, almost to the exclusion of\nassociation with people outside of\nits domain.\nThe problem is the reputation is\nintrinsically bound up with the sad\nnature of this hallowed institution's occupants (inmates?). This place\nweeds out those who do not follow\nthe strict, regimented order of\nstudy, those who didn't join the\ntrain spot soc when they got here.\nWhere is the creativity? What the\nhell happened when Civ Eng built\nthat sports complex? Perhaps we\nshould merge with an arts college.\nWho has killed the life in these\nmonochrome parodies of human\nbeings, these husks, mere shells\nwho have been beaten into\nobedience by the system? By the\nend of the first year, large swathes\nof people who have not subscribed\nto the system's beliefs have been\neradicated by it. Failed or left: and\ngood luck to 'em.\nHave you noticed other London\nstudents' attitude towards you when\nyou tell them you're from\nImperial\u2014social lepers or what?\nBy the way, whilst Imperial's been strutting its stuff about how\ngood it is (according to the Times\nchart), its international reputation,\netc, take a look at the score for its\nteaching (32 out of 80): way below\nnot only Cambridge, but most other\nuniversities in the country.\nWell 'nuff said. We're leaving.\nWe admit defeat. You've weeded\nout these saps.\nBack Row Boys at Computing.\nAnarchy\nDear Jonty,\nFollowing the article on the\nAnarchist Cookbook (by William\nPowell, Barricade Books, \u00a318), I realised I named the wrong street:\nevery place described is Charing\nCross Road, not Oxford Street.\nSorry for those who wasted time\nlooking there, and thanks for\npointing out the mistake.\nAlso, for those who went to raid\nthe local stores for Morning Glory,\nthe active species are 'Heavenly\nBlue' (Ipomea Violeacea), 'Pearly\nGates', 'Wedding Bells', 'Summer\nSkies', 'Blue Star' and 'Flying\nSaucers' and you've got to bloody\ngrind them first, though it's none of\nmy business why you'd want to do\nthat. Please remember some brands\ncoat their seeds in poison.\nHans C. Ridiculous\nDear Jonty,\n'the most effective way of\nattacking vice is to expose it to\npublic ridicule. People can put up\nwith rebukes but they cannot bear\nbeing laughed at: they are prepared\nto be wicked but they dislike\nappearing ridiculous'.\nI therefore do not believe these\nrumours about Sir Eric Ash wanting\nto spend \u00a3100,000 on further\nrefurbishment of 170 Queensgate,\nthat would be patently ridiculous.\nYours thoughtfully,\nMoliere.\nSonia's OK\nDear Jonty,\nI am writing in response of Sonia\nShah's item in Felix 967 about the\nDalai Lama. Many important issues\nwere raised and dealt with clearly\nand in an informative way. It is\ngood that Felix covers these events\nand supports cases where human\nrights are so obviously being\ndenied.\nAnd! Not a single gratuitous use\nof the word 'fuck'.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 UJ J111 Issue 969 4th June 1993\nRealisation Forte at Queens\nby Declan Curry\nThe Science community has given\nmuted approval to the Science\nWhite Paper, which plans to abolish\nthe advisory boards, upgrade the\nstatus of the MSc degree, and\nshuffle the research councils. Dr\nDai Rees, secretary of the Medical\nResearch Council (MRC) said he\nwas 'pleased to see the bold and\nrealistic approach' the White Paper\nwas taking 'to the many urgent\nissues currently facing UK science\nand technology.'\nThe changes to the Research\nCouncils have been widely\nwelcomed. The Agricultural and\nFood Research Council (AFRC)\n'welcomed the expansion in its\nresponsibilities to become the\nBiotechnology and Biological\nSciences Research Council.'\nProfessor Tom Blundell, AFRC\nDirector General said 'the move\nrecognises the coming of age of\nbiology-based technologies and\ntheir enormous potential for\nindustrial innovation.'\nThe Royal Society hailed the\nWhite Paper as 'offering a promising framework for the future\ndevelopment of science and\ntechnology in Britain,' but\ncautioned that the 'new Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (EPSRC) will have to adopt\nan enlightened long term policy.'\nThe EPSRC was formed out of the\nold Science and Engineering\nResearch Council (SERC), which\nsaid that 'the increase in the number\nof Research Councils from five to\nsix misses an opportunity.' Sir\nMark Richmond, SERC Chairman\nalso said he was 'disappointed that\nthe new Councils will have no\nincreased resources.'\nProfessor John Knill, Natural\nEnvironment Research Council\n(NERC) chairman, said they had\nbeen 'piloting the idea of the one\nyear MSc course plus a three year\nPhD course,' a major proposal in\nthe White Paper. Dr Dai Rees of the\nMRC 'welcomed sensible proposals\non the reform of postgraduate\neducation and the management of\nresearch staff in universities.' Dr\nDavid Harrison, chairman of the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals (CVCP) said they\n'welcomed the Government's intention to review the management\nof the PhD.' Chris Hamblade, of\nthe National Union of Students, said\nhe was concerned about the\nreduction in the number of available\nthree year PhD courses.\nDr Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's Charter spokesman, deplored the\ndearth of measures in the White\nPaper designed to improve the\nstatus of women in science and\ntechnology. 'The Government's solution to the problem is simply to\nset up another committee. British\nwomen scientists and engineers\nneed fewer empty promises and\nmore action,' Dr Mowlam told a Newcastle conference.\nProfessor Howard Newby,\nchairman of the Economic and\nSocial Research Council said he\nwas 'very sad about the intention\nnot to create a separate Humanities\nResearch Council.' Dr David\nHarrison said 'the CVCP regrets the\nGovernment's failure to support the\nestablishment of a Humanities\nResearch Council.'\nHer Majesty the Queen celebrated forty years on the throne this we\nwrites Declan Curry. This landmark was celebrated at Imperial by the\nloud ringing of the bells in Queen's Tower. There was also a41 gun sa\nin Hyde Park and a62 gun salute at the Tower of London.

Whether\nShakespeare is entirely responsible\nfor the elevated egocentric it y of the\nEnglish is perhaps a difficult claim\nto qualify, but the proliferation of\nthe English language and the\nEnglish media across the world\nmakes a plausible basis for\nconsidering our view of our status,\nin contrast to the view of the UK held by our international\ncontemporaries. And furthermore,\nhow do we assess British justice,\nonce proclaimed the envy of the\nworld, in the light of the Guildford\nFour, the Birmingham Six, and\nJudith Ward? The ghosts of\nTimothy Evans and Derek Bentley\nfail to raise their heads because their\nnecks were broken.\nCivil unrest is, I suppose, the best\nway to describe the Miners' Strike,\nthe Poll Tax riots, the Greenham\nCommon demonstration, et cetera.\nWe have paranoia theorists who are\nonly too keen to tell us of phone-tapping, of MI5 and the armed\nforces plotting a military coup\nduring the last Labour Government,\nof spy rings at GCHQ, and of senior\nCabinet ministers involved in arms\ndeals with nations they subsequently\ndecide to send troops against. We\nare constantly told by our\nGovernment how much better than\nothers we are, in whatever issues\nare effecting the comparison, but\n'better than' does not mean 'good\nenough'. I am reminded of the\npolitican disclaiming that\n'Unemployment is no excuse for\njoyriding or drug abuse' when it is\nnot being offered as an excuse, but\nby way of explanation.\n'Forty years, eh?'. Forty years.\n'Not said much about her, have\nyou?' I have left that to my\nillustrious colleague. 'Not very\nbalanced, then, is it?' The way I see\nit, my evidence will counterbalance\nyour ego. ' Ah, well. At least Sir\nEdmund Hillary conquered Everest\nfor The Empire'. Not bad for a New Zealander, especially with\nsuch a dead weight.\nDeclan Curry\nleads us through\nAbdication, and\nfinds himself in\nRobespierre's waistcoat\nWhat role does the Royal Family\nplay in Britain? Not the Monarchy,\nwhich has a constitutional job of\nwork, but the Royals, the\nCoronation Clan, the Grasping\nGathering. Are they merely the\nBritish ambassadors to Klosters? A monument to the flailing British\ntourist industry? Lodging mates for\nMichael Fagan? Possibly they are\nall of these, but the predominant\nrole of the British Royal Family is\nas escapism. We need our fun, our\nNazi Germany, continuing their\nfeigned reign. And when Britain\nwas at war with Germany,\nElizabeth did her bit as a jobbing\nRAF mechanic. She also saw the\nesteem of the Royals rising as her\nmother visited London's East End\nafter Luftwaffe bombings.\nAfter the war came a new\nnationalistic fer v our, stoked up by\nthe Festival of Britain. The Royal\nFamily turned the corner. National\nmourning at the death of George\nVI, national condemnation of the\ngl py^ sy^|||gM|j||j|^^\"' sill!!\ndiversions, something to look at and\nshrug, 'maybe things aren't that bad\nafter all'. Come to one, all ye who\nare burdened. Queenie, the\nentertaining musical, at a Palace\nnear you.\nAt the time of the Coronation, the\npress publishing funeral\nphotographs of a grieving mother,\nwife and daughter, national joy\nwhen the daughter became Queen\nin her own right.\nThe Coronation was the start of\nEntertainment UK, and the Queen\n27 year old Queen was fully alive\nto the importance of keeping the\nRoyals popular. She had witnessed\nthe trauma and tribulations when\nEdward abdicated for Mrs\nSimpson. She heard the grating of\nteeth when the pretenders King\nEdward and Queen Wallis visited\nwas its chief instigator. Against the\nadvice of the Prime Minister and\nothers, she allowed television\ncameras into Westminster Abbey\nfor the Coronation ceremony.\nLater, in 1969, the nation was\nallowed a quick peak at the Royal\nfamily life, with the veil drawn back\nagain by television. Last year, to\ncommemorate her 40 years on the\nThrone, HM let cameras maraud all\nover Balmoral to give us a year in\nthe life of One.\nSome great, good and senile say\nthat this is when the rot set in. That\nBBC documentary, showing Anne\ntalking through a stuffed mouthful\nof sausage, detracted from the real\npurpose of the Royals, represented\nby the Caernarvon investiture of the\nsame year. But is the escapism not\nfuelled by the heady mix of tradition\nand modernity, encouraging a sense\nof continuity when all is in flux?\nShe's always there, God luv 'er.\nNot that she always seemed to be\nthere. The spotlight shifted from\ntime to time. Onto Princess Anne\nand Captain Mark Phillips for the\nRoyal Wedding. Here's Prince\nCharles and Lady Diana Spencer\nfor another Royal Wedding.\nThere's Prince Andrew and Sarah\nFergeson, you'll never guess, a Royal Wedding. Back to the Duke\nand Duchess for a Royal\nSeparation. Over the Prince and\nPrincess of Wales for another\nseparation. Joining us now is Anne\nWindsor, with the Royal\nSeparation, divorce and re-marriage. Behind the beaming smile\nfor the 1992 Royal Grampian\nWedding, did the Queen, babysitter extra ordinaire, reflect on her\nentry to 20th century family life? So\nmany single parents.\nStill, it was a nice wedding, in\ntime for Christmas, and smoking\nout the memory of the Great\nWindsor Toast-Out. Enough has\nbeen written about the Annus,\nsuffice to add that if fire consumed\nmy house, I hope the taxman\nwouldn't roll up with the fire\nengine. There have been other fun\nmoments. Charles falling off his\npolo horse. William getting a club\non the side of the head at school.\nSome fool trying to kidnap Princess\nAnne whilst driving up the Mall.\nDiana's close encounters with the\nchina cabinet. Andrew's exploits in\nthe Falklands. Edward being Really\nUseful. Philip, the slit ty eyes, the\npot- bellied Hungarians, and the\nKoala with mange. To top it all, the\naged relic Queen Mother chokes on\na bit of maggot ted salmon. In\npublic, she's just in for observation.\nIn private, it's throat cancer.\nHeaven help us when she dies.\nWhat does one turn to for escapism\nthen?\nfrom left to right: Ken\nLivingstone, Anotny Wedgewood\nBenn, Margret Thatcher, John\nMajor, The Queen Mother, Price\nPhillip (by Spitting Image),\nQueen Elizabeth 2 and Prince\nCharles\nPage 13\n\n"

We should scrap the Royal\nFamily. I know that ? weeks ago I said we should keep them.\nBut the current surge of special\nreports, full page opinions, late\nnight discussions and all the rest of\nthe media space fillers have caused\nme to change my mind.

If you use a condom and an\noil based lubricant you could be in\ntrouble. It has been shown that the\noil based lubricants eat away at the\nrubber of the condom making it\nmuch more likely to break during\nthe strains of lovemaking. Tiny\nperforations develop, invisible to\nthe eye, and reduce the condom's ITALY.\nstrength by up to 90%. Well, that's what it said in the information pack,\nand who I am to question?\nBut why bother with it anyway?\nThe main users are male\nhomosexuals, as the act of anal sex\nis a little short on lubrication.\nFrequently it is used in 'moments\nwhen a little extra help is needed'\nduring heterosexual intercourse\n(Quotes taken from any advert for\nthe ever famous KY Jelly). What\nhas worried many Doctors is that\nwhen the wheels of love need to\ngreased, the first thing most people\nreach for is Baby Oil. In these days\nfear about AIDS a condom that is\nlikely to burst is a very dangerous\nthing and common Baby Oil is one\nof those risky substances.

They have\nemployed a PR company to prove\nhow wonderful their tubes of oil are\ncompared to nasty condom-rotting\nJohnson's Baby Lotion.\nActually doing the test in the kit\nproved to be a little more difficult\nthan would be first imagined.\nFirstly, the two condoms supplied\nwith the kit were no longer there,\nsomeone had run of with one of\nthem.

    "content": "Felix 969\nR ag\n4 June 1993\nPerspective on '68\nDear Editor,\nI read with some interest your\narticle on May '68, but the causes\nfor present apathy didn't come out\nclearly. Jonty Beavan mentions Ian\nPigg (NUS General Sec) who puts\nthe blame on middle-class\nupbringing: students want a good\njob not a revolutionary country.\nWhile this is partly true, there are\na number of facts that need to be\npointed out:\nThe May '68 revolution was\nstarted by sons and daughters of the\nelite: middle- and upper-class\ncitizens who wanted a new world.\nThey were part of the post-war\nbaby-boom; they needed extra\naccommodation and education\nfacilities. The government didn't plan for it immediately and had to\nbuild hastily new campuses,\npreferably in the suburbs. These\nbuildings were basically lifeless\nslabs of concrete. How could\nstudents accept this, especially if\nthey were the country's best? Like\nin 1789, the May '68 revolution\nwas ignited by people who felt they\ndeserved more, namely the\nb our jeou is, or middle-class.\nWhat made their lives duller still\nwere the strict (and often petty)\nrules by which they were\nsurrounded: no visits to girls' rooms\nin the evening, no 'modern' music,\nto name two. Their environment\nwas stiff ling: relations with teachers\nwere cold and distant. Lecturers\ndidn't feel human and demanded\nutter respect. Also, on the political\nside, De Gaulle had been in control\nfor ten years by then, with only one\namendment to the constitution (in\n1961). Students were practically\nforbidden to criticise the\ngovernment. Even the ORTF\n(television and radio) was run by the\nstate. Things only started moving\nwhen the left came to power,\nespecially under Miterrand. How\ncan students, the intellectual elite,\nbe forbidden to express themselves?\nThis explains the meaning of The\nGuardian's words: 'a saddled old\nsociety' which had to be taken 'on\na fantastic liberating curve'.\nMy second point is that none of\nthe above occur presently in\nEngland, or for that matter in the\nUK. Although, student poverty is\na problem of some concern for a number among us, our lives (social,\nnot academical, that is) are far from\ndreary and dictated by law. Sex,\ndrink and music are common and\ncertainly not restricted. Chris\nDavidson changed ICU constitution\nwith little or no interference from\nthe State. How can one complain?\nThe cause for apathy is the fact that\nnothing bothers students seriously\nand any trouble can be rapidly\nremedied thanks to Dep Reps and\nFlip chart abuse\nTo continue a recent\ntheme... 'Neither use nor ornament,\nthose sabbaticals! Take that\nPresident of ours, the Scottish\npl on ker, what's he up to? Nine\nmonths of focus groups, working\nparties, council meetings and what\ndoes he have to show for it....A new Union structure and a drink\nproblem. True, true, the members\nof the working group spent hours,\ndays even, putting together what\nshould be a Union that will serve\nits members into the next century,\nin terms of social athletic, academic\nand welfare needs. They have\nconsulted hundreds of people,\nrecorded hours of tape, written\nendless reports...That's another\nthing, reports..\n'What the point anyway?\nVoluntary membership, that's the\nusual excuse, pathetic, You'd think\nthey wanted the Union to be useful\nor something. That's not what\nUnions are for! They always have\nand always should be full of\nbureaucratic meetings and hours of\nwasting time. After all, everybody\nloves being in meetings all night.\nGetting involved in the Union\nshould be difficult. Well, we don't want any old student walking in and\nchanging everything, it has worked\nthis way for nigh on fifty years and\nshould stay like it is. Regardless of\nwhether it does its job.'\n'I 'll tell you what, the Union\nGeneral Meeting on Friday the 25th of June inthe Junior Common Room\nshould be a laugh. We'll show that\nChris Davidson what we think of a customer focused Union...'\nThat's what Lionel Blair thinks of\nthe Union restructuring, what do\nyou think?\nNext week Chris Davidson in flip\nchart abuse shocker!\nThis has been a party political\nbroadcast on behalf of the Union\nStructure Working Party.\nICU. If there was any matter truly\nwrong and not solved, I can assure\nattention will be drawn upon it very\nquickly. Another cause for apathy\nis the actual educational system. ' A' Levels don't often entail more than\nthree or four subjects. In France for\nthe Baccaloureat, you have around\nten subjects: in addition to maths,\nphysics, chemistry and biology you\nhave history and philosophy, and if\nyou wish sociology and economics.\nThese give you the background\nnecessary to understand revolution.\nWho at IC can claim to know\nTrotsky's work? Who at IC knows\nthe difference between the first and\nthe second International?\u2014probably\nno more than the advocates of\ninternational socialism. I should\nperhaps point out this was also the\ndemise of the May '68 revolution.\nThe students usually understood the\nmeaning of their movement, but the\nnine million strikers didn't. They\njust wanted shorter hours and more\nmoney. De Gaulle was able to\nmanipulate them (thanks to the\nORTF) before the June elections;\nand he won a landslide victory.\nI hope these few facts and ideas\nwill make people want to deepen\ntheir knowledge of our world.
