It is \"one\nthing that definitely could be improved throughout the\norganisation.\" Steps to achieve this more effectively\nhave already been put in place, involving among other\nthings, residential weekends and Thursday lunchtime\nmeetings with the Rector. If anyone wants to extend\nthe invitation to student journalists, you know where\nto find me... The College Notice is a powerful weapon\nin the information arsenal for disseminating the decisions of the mighty, or so our newly arrived Secretary\nthough. You've never heard\nof one, and by you I mean\nall of you, from 1 st years to\nHeads of Departments.\nComing from the Army, this\ncame as a bit of a surprise.\n\"I was stopped in my tracks... when a Head of\nDepartment said, i what is a College Notice?'\" He aims to sort this out, and\nalthough he admits that most of these are less than\nriveting, we might one day find out when some important decision is taken that affects us through a channel\nother than Felix. It is also hoped that Felix will cease to\nbe the only conduit through which reports of the\nMessed-up Project Group (known in Sherfield as MPG) reach the masses, as their publication is \"under dis-cus sion\". As for Felix itself, The College Secretary feels\nthat it does its job well, quashing rumours that he feels\nthe cat should not be entirely free.\nAs regular readers will know, Iam fulsome in my\npraise of the College's \"commercial\" activities. Indeed,\nif you ignore such outmoded measures of effectiveness as profit, customer satisfaction and management\ncompetence, they are among some of the best to be\nfound in Western Europe. We are about research and\nteaching, not building management, not security and\ncertainly not catering. Mr Mitcheson's views on contracting out were very encouraging. Though his is not\nconvinced that things are as bad as many suggest, he\nsaid, \"we should bear it in mind... you would be foolish not to keep all the various permutations and\noptions in your mind. You would be failing in your\nduty.\" This is in stark contrast to the Rector's opinion\nlast May, and if things have\nchanged this significantly, the\n\u2022 leg e Secretary deserves four\ncheers. As he points out, if our\nS BinS operations are up to\nscratch, they have nothing to\nlj| i from market testing these\n\u2022 Hc or c activities. \"I firmly\n\u2022 Bt ve[ they] are doing a good\n\u2022 Hand therefore it should not\n\u2022 Bp threat.\" Once the medical\nmerger has settled down, let us\nw KK f that these fine words are\nturned into actions.\nCampus Renaissance is\nnow firmly upon us, with the\nBMS nearing completion, and a j ll jj of other projects about to\nHp. such as the Beit Quad \u2022 \u2022 b ish ment. This had led to a fair amount of disquiet in\n\u2022 leg e on account of the dis\u2022 J Ht in College, if you follow.\nAsked whether the impact of\nH fp projects was fully consid-ered, Mr Mitch es on replied\n\u2022 JB \"any work is inevitably\ngoing to cause you to divert off\na pavement and walk around,\nand you may be slightly inconvenienced.\" I suspect students\nin Chemistry may put the level\nof disruption at a slightly higher\nlevel than that, but it is certainly difficult making omelettes\nwithout breaking eggs. The\nEstates' view that they do not have enough time to\nplan projects in such a way as to minimise such disruption - often a fair\ncomment. The real test\nof.'this v vH i \u2022 ''he level\nof' inconvenience that\nthe medics will have\ntolerate when the\nMultiDisciplinary Research Building goes\nup next to the BMS. After just over two hours with Tony Mitcheson, I found myself fairly impressed, and 1 don't say that\nabout many in Suite Five. He has been here for about\neight months and, miraculously, has avoided 'going\nnative', the fate that; seems to befall almost ail who\nenter the upper echelons of Sherfield, stripping them\nof their thoughts, hopes and dreams. Here is a man\nwho seems unafraid to 'think the unthinkable, for\nwhom change in not anathema.

I found him\nto be perfectly pleasant and far less defensive than\nsome of his colleagues; either that or, Heaven for fend,I gave him an e av 'inch rests on his shoulders\nover the next few years, and as long as he keeps moving in the right direction, we can expect major\nimprovements. Not bad, not bad at all. And I'm not\nbeing a creep, Tony.\n\"Yes there will be cock-ups...I subscribe to the\ncock up theory, rather than\nthe conspiracy theory\"\n\n"

    "content": "Br?* NEWS 30 January 1998\nTory Rebel Speaks Out News in Brief...\nANDY SINHARAY\nIC's Conservative Society played\nhost to )oh n Wilkinson, MP for\nRuislip North, on Wednesday. In\na half-hour long talk the former\nRAF Pilot, who first entered politics nearly thirty years ago,\nexpounded his views on Europe, a matter which he described as\n\"close to my heart\".\nHe had voted against the then-Conservative Government on the\nMaastricht Motion in 1992, and had the whip removed after\nabstaining on the Second Reading\nof the EC Finance Bill in 1994. Mr. Wilkinson said that after the Danish\nanti-Maastricht vote, he had been\ncompelled to read the Treaty for\nhimself, which he felt made demands on the nation which had\nnot been presented to the votes at\nthe last election. \"It was a dawn\nraid,\" he said. He also spoke of the\n\"awful experience of losing a general election... [which was due] to\nour inability to come clean to the\nvoters\" on European policy. \"I felt\ndefeat was inevitable,\" he added, saying he felt the Referendum Party\nwas right to call for a nation-wide\nballot on monetary union.\nMr. Wilkinson went onto say\nthat although the present government realises the UK economy is\nout of phase with the rest of\nEurope, he said he was happier\nwith the current Tory line on the\nmatter under Hague than under\nMajor. In general he felt that closer\nEuropean integration was ex pen sive, not merely financially but also\nin terms of both power and sovereignty. The Common Agricultural\nPolicy, he said, was an \"international scandal... rigged, crooked,\nfraudulent... the EU runs the most\nhighly protectionist policy to keep\nprices artificially high.\" This worked\nagainst trade with the former\nCommunist states and the\nDeveloping World. Smaller states\nwere better, he felt, as the voters\nwere closer to their elected representatives. But in spite of what\nmany consider to be Euro-sceptical\nviews, he added that his objections\nwere principally towards European\nintegration in present form. He closed with the remark, \"We have a vision of a community of states\nwhich accords better with our\ninterests, their interests and the\nprinciples of democracy we hold\ndear.\"\nBIO CHEM BONUS loi9S lf lC# A team from Imperial has won a national competition organised by\nthe Young Entrepreneurs Scheme\n(YES), which aims to teach young scientists how to deal with\ninvestors and the City. Each team\nin the competition had to submit a realistic business plan, and the best\ntwo of each region were given the\nchance to convince a panel of\njudges of their suitability to run a company. The IC team, InCap\nTechnologies, consisted of Sarah\nCant, Viola Stoll, Kian Heng Ng,.\nAlan Tang and Leonor Galvao, who patented an insulin pill after conducting research in America, Israel\nand the UK. InCap was selected as\none of the best two in the region,\nand were sent to the Department\nof Trade and Industry for the finals.\nHere, they presented their ideas\nand business plans alongside five\nother finalists, and won overall.\nThe Managing Director, Sarah Cant,\ntold Felix that the whole experience\nhad been extremely useful and\nworthwhile, adding that she and\nher company had learnt a lot about\nall areas of industry.\nTITS OUT FOR THE GENTLEMEN King's College London have\nallowed a society based on the\n\"appreciation of the art of the\nhuman form\" to be ratified by their\nSports and Societies Board. The\n'Gentlemen's Viewing Society' is\nopen to \"all the members of King's, of all sex, race and religion\", but is\nthought by some to be an excuse\nto watch hard core pornographic\nfilms. The Society has denied all\nallegations of being involved with\nporn, stating that they will run an\nhistorical course including exam i nations. King's Sports and Societies Board ratified the society,\nwith those in favour including the\nPresident of the Jewish Society and\nthe head of the Christian Union.\nStudents Driven Mad Gas a Deadly Danger\nJULIA HARRIES\nA report in the Guardian this\nweek claimed that 35% of academics have dealt with students\nwith mental health problems.\nThe survey, commissioned by the\nfunding council's 'Special Initiative\nto Encourage High Quality\nProvision for Students with\nLearning Difficulties and\nDisabilities,' was carried out at Hull\nUniversity.\nMany respondents were aware\nof their own limitations in dealings\nwith mentally ill students. It had\nbeen noticed that many students,\nespecially foreigners, are not keen\non consulting university counsel-lor s, since that would involve an\nadmission of problems which they\nfeel unable to deal with. Many are\nalso afraid that such an admission\nmay affect their progress or refer-en ces. The confidentiality of counselling services can infuriate teaching staff, keen to monitor student\nprogress and to see what support\nis needed. Often, it is friends who are the first to notice problems like\nanorexia and bulimia. More problems arise when students refuse to\nallow families to be informed, as\nstaff feel they cannot give support\nwithout parental back-up. Another\npotential problem lies in GPs not\nhaving patient case histories.\nWhen moving to university and\nchanging GPs, records are slow to\ntransfer to the new GP, leaving\nthem unaware of past mental problems. GPs often provide access to\nother specialist mental health ser-vices. Academics' realisation of\ntheir inexperience provokes\ndemands for greater pastoral care.\nThe research shows the need for\nuniversities to redefine their welfare provision, and to ensure that\nacademics have enough resources\nto properly help students. The\nresearchers commented \"We are a long way from achieving an atmosphere in which mental problems\ncan be... effectively addressed\".\nANDY SINHARAY\nStudents are being urged to\ncheck faulty gas appliances.\nAccording to the National Union\nof Students, ten deaths have\noccurred in student houses in\nrecent years, due to the inhalation of carbon monoxide from\nfaulty equipment. Students in pri-vat ely rented accommodation are\nbelieved to be particularly at risk as\nthe NUS alleges that dishonest\nlandlords, claiming to have safe\nboilers and heaters in order to\navoid repair costs, have been\nresponsible for student deaths. The\nwinter weather encourages students to spend more time indoors\nand deaths are the most prevalent\nat this time of year. \"Late January\nand early February is the peak\ntime,\" an NUS source told Felix.\n\"We always take this very seri-ou sly,\" said Martin Thomson, Union Advisor at ICU. All landlords,\nhe said are legally required to\nprove that all gas equipment has\nbeen declared safe within the last\nI2 months, and the NUS in particular has requested that \"all students should make sure they see\nthis certificate now, or call the gas\nsafety action line. \" Mr. Thomson\nalso urged students to check that\nany faulty appliances had been\nchecked, though to his knowledge\nthere had been no serious incidents involving Imperial students\nand faulty heating. Mr. Thomson\ntold Felix that though people have\nbeen concerned about carbon\nmonoxide levels where detectors\nhave picked it up, \"I thankfully\nhaven't come across anyone being\nill due to carbon monoxide poison-ing... we do have posters and\nleaflets available in the union\noffice,\" he said, and he added that\nanyone worried about the issue is\nwelcome to discuss the matter\nwith him. Mr. Thomson can be\nreached on x48067. The gas safety\naction line can be called free on\n0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 6 3 .\n\n"

Afyoice called out.\n\"Ha ha, how does it feel? Can't the little\nbrats take pain like grown men?\"\nDan straightened up. He was sweating\nrepeatedly under his breath. Two figures leapt\nout of the hedge and started sauntering towards\nthem. One of them was lazily waving a black air\nrifle with telescopic sight at them;\nDan, Marco and Zed immediately recognised them. They were known as Bill and Butch,\nand were physically almost exact opposites of\neach other. Bill was tall and slim. He had pale\nskin and very black, gleaming, long hair which\nwas swept out of his face. He was offensively\ngood-looking. Butch was shorter and stockier.\nHis face had been savaged by acne, leaving\nprominent scars on his cheeks and still lingering\naround his mouth and on his forehead. His hair\nhad been shaved off and was only just reemerging in the form of a brown dusting on his\nscalp. Bill was carrying the air rifle.\n\"That's assault, you bastards,\" shouted Dan.\nHe was dismayed to hear that his voice was shaking.\nBill and Butch came towards them. Marco and Ron still had their hands over their injuries.\nBill walked up to Dan and stopped half a foot in\nfront of him. He bent down until their noses\nalmost touched and then said, very softly, \"just\nwatch how you address your betters\".\n,i> straightened \u2022\n\u2022 looked\naround. \"What are he little f;. cus doing he ie.I if von der?\" Hl' j fp?

He willed\nRon to .feel the same J^ QJfdrfrik his anger, to\ninfect him, and that is iS act ly what happened.\nFor the rest of his life, even though he never:\nmentioned it to anyone, he truly believed thai\nthis is what happened. Dan would become\nscientist, to his own mild surprise, but he haft f always been a rational thinker. What happened\nin that moment was not rational. In his later life\nit would embarrass him to think about it, or even\ncontemplate what happened, so much so that\nhe eventually managed to block it out of his\nmind. What he believed was that somehow, for\none fleeting instant, his and Ron's mind touched\nand that during this moment he was sucked\nbare; in the next moment his mind felt as empty\nas a vacuum.\nRon took one step forward and began to\nreach for the spade. Bill calmly levelled the gun\nat him from the waist.\n\"Watch it, moron, or I might just have to\nremove your last brain cell.\"\nRon picked up the spade. Butch shuffled\nuncomfortably. Dan calmly took in everything.\nHe was thinking like a machine; there was no\nfear, no hate, no anger. He knows he can't shoot Ron at this range, he thought, from over\nby the hedge the pellet wasn't going to do much\ndamage, just leave a bruise. But from this distance it's going to puncture the skin and'll have\nto be removed surgically. He could tell that Bill\nwis thinking furiously, even though his face was\nas expressionless as ever.\nRon very slowly began to raise she spade; he\nwas standing about six feet from Bill and Holding\nits shaft halfway up with both hands. ^Dan was\naware of Zed's and Marco's breathing beside\nhim; it was quick and shallow.\n\"Er, Bill-\" began Butch.\nBill ignored him. \"Drop the spade, dude,\" he\nsaid gently. Ron was still raising it. Its shaft was\nparallel to the ground. Bill was pointing the gun\nat Ron's thigh when he pulled the trigger.\nA fraction:\niW:S\\ Second before the gun gave\nits mechanical cough, Ron moved the spade\n\u2022 i \u2022 \" . is harm-.\nless ly deflected, There is no way that Ron could\n'h alps reacted see quickly to that shot, thought\nDan, he moved before the shot was fired; he\nanticipated it. Bill grabbed the baire l of the gun\nwith both hands and set it swinging in an arc\nthat would connect with, Ron's head. With an\nalmost supernaturally fast motion Ron raised the\nspade up to his face' a ril Bp rn less ly gathered up\ntl e rifle's blow, then using the momentum he-had gained from the gun he slashed Bill across\nthe fa eee y vith the blade of the spade in one fluid\nmovement.

Ron calmly\n|:|a is ld his weapon and again it connected with\nBill's head. The stroke was short but powerful.\nNo time wasted, just getting right down to bus i ness. Like a natural. Bill died.\nButch overcame his paralysis and started\nrunning, he almost tripped, but made it. Ron\ndidn't notice. He was still laying into Bill, with\nthat same alien mindless, efficiency. After a full\nminute he stopped. Bill was un recognisable. Ron\nturned towards Zed. still holding the dripping\ntool. Zed hitched in breath to scream, but nothing came out, just a dry, choked cough.\nRon dropped the spade and without turning\nback began to run across the field. Marco was\nstanding very still, his eyes firmly shut. Zed tried\nto take off his glasses but his hands were shaking so much that he dropped them. Dan was\nwatching Ron, running away into the distance.\nHis movements were smooth and cat-like, for-e ign, like something from another world.\n\n"

All of these\nhave been used to describe the\nman who used to front some non-important band in the late eighties.\nIan Brown took up gardening, DJing\nand did a bit of travelling after the\ndisintegration of the Stone Roses\nback in 1996. He was convinced at\nthat time that he had given up\nmusic for good. In his press\nrelease announcing the split, he\ncalled the music industry 'the filthiest business in the world' and said\nblankly that he was glad that he\nwas leaving. A world was divided\nat this announcement. Some said,\n'Hey, that's the blok e that can't sing, isn't it? It's a bloody good job\nthat he's not gonna be making any\nmore stupid noises in the future!'\nand then there was the cohort that\nwere crestfallen. Ian Brown was a Stone Rose and he couldn't just\ndisappear, could he? Well, he did. For a while, anyway. While fellow\nex-Rose John Squire was forming\nup a band which included bus kers and other random musicians from\nYork, Brown's exact location was\nunknown. Was he in Europe some-where? Was he ever coming back?\nWas it true that he had cut his hair?\nRumours aside, he returned a few months ago to tell us that he\nwas working on a project called\nUnder the Beach, The Pavement - a reference to the French student\nriots in the sixties. What it would\nbe like was anyone's guess - this is\na man who is quoted as saying that\nhe doesn't really like music in this\ncountry and any music he likes he\nhas to import from places like\nJamaica. Would his, then, be a reggae album (imagine lyrics sung\nin a cross between West Indian and\nheavy Man c union)? Well, no.\nBrown chose not to add to the\nrepertoire of excellent music in the\nvein of Bob marley and instead\nreturned with a sort of cross\nbetween science fiction-fuelled\ngroove (My Star) as well as original\nfunky groove (Can't See Me) with\nan essence of pop thrown in (can't think of a specific one here...)\nBrown has given a lot of press\ntime to this album, something whenever normally does. His face\nis, at the moment, on about three\nor four magazines and he even\nappeared on Radio 1. There are\ntwo themes to all his interviews.\nFirst is the 'true' story of the Roses\nbreak-up. This includes stories of\nSquire's cocaine habit and how that\nmade him leave the band. The\nsecond is his resolute mission to\ntell the kids that cocaine is evil and\nthat no-one should get into it.\nVery wise words indeed and ones\nmm\nMoon Safari \"\u2022 * *\n| | if are two French blok es j lj fc'1''' Up \u2022 > , iM\\ duce A nii'ln ns' pen ot an\nal but' \u2022\n\u2022 v. il \u2022 '\u2022 i aba\nbly thi . , - > . . , , ; -'-ii' >sim'\ni,/ ii \u2022 :<-\u2022!'\u2022-.\ntime.\nli rou iv i \u2022 ' \u2022\u2022 <or a sub-lime, laid back excursion into the\nrealms of toned down ambience\n, ( d, ii iii -j. ice of forty\nii\"'i no further.

His introverted,\nchildish yet surreal and probing\ncomic verse is generally viewed as\nutterly bizarre, like an Guardian\nreader's Ivor Cutler.\nFrom French knock-knock jokes\n(Frappe-fra ppe. Qui est la? Jean.\nJean qui? Gendarme) to observations from his childhood (My father\nalways told my sister that she\nshouldn't play with her food. He\nsaid that carrots do not make very\ngood friends) and searching,\npleading poetry, his styles subjects\nare diverse to say the least, from\nhis gentle love of potatoes to his\ndeclarations on religion and quirky\ntales of unrequited love. As a per-former, he is as you might expect,\nnervous, awkward though throughout retaining control, and he is\nendearingly unafraid to make a fool\nout of himself; able to carry the\nflopped line with a muttered\nexcuse which usually manages more of a laugh than the intended\npunchline. Hegley meanders\naround the stage, from the lip to a lectern, on then to a blackboard on\nwhich he charts his journey geographically as he describes his life\nstory in verse and song, accompanied by the ever deadpan Nigel on\nthe Portuguese guitar. A brief\nattempt at improvisation left him\nfloundering just before the break,\nbut he coasted the second half\nafter a slide show of his simple,\nhilarious line drawings and novelty\npotato items. A lot of material was\nfrom his recent compendium Family Pack, including classics like\nThe Difference Between Dogs and\nSheds, The Play and Coming Home\nFor Christmas, but he also demonstrated a good amount of new\nworks. His regular appearances on\nMark Radcliffe's old Radio 1\nevening show ensured a fairly full\ntheatre, but 1 feel that both he and\nthe audience would have benefited\nfrom a more intimate venue.\nShown the appreciation he\ndeserves, Hegley can charm and\ndelight. He didn't quite pull it off at\nthe Bloomsbury, but he was still al-right. Apologies...\nMr. Trout\n[Look out for an interview with\nJohn Hegley by Mr. Trout next\nweek - Arts Ed]\nSIGHTINGS - NEW\nPHOTOGRAPHIC ART\nInstitute of Contemporary Arts\nGo and see this presentation\nby a new generation of\nartists from around the\nglobe. All sorts of avenues are\nexplored and a range of influences\nare apparent. Some of the artists\nhave enhanced their work using the\ncomputer technology which is\nbecoming a trademark of the ICA.\nThis has been interwoven with traditional landscape scenes to create\na truly contemporary snapshot.\nIt is a little annoying to find\nonly a few exhibits from each artist;\nEspecially when some of the work\nis obviously from a wider series\n(and it's good).\nAs you walk around the display\npanel in the \"Lower Gallery\", you are confronted with a piece by Paul\nSeawright; huge, filthy hands, clear\ndown to the smallest wrinkle. This\nBritish photographer manages to\ncreate allure out of his seemingly\nharrowing subject of street life. The\nimmense scope of this exhibition\nallows pieces such as this to be\nviewed next to work inspired by\nAlice in Wonderland, with a slightly\ntwisted edge of course, after all\nthis is modern art.\nSeveral of the artists have\ndecided to use human subjects,\nEsko Mannikko's \"Mexas series\" is\none example which illustrates the\npoverty and disorder that can be\nfound in America. On the other\nhand, themes such as the continuation of life are also apparent in the\nsame pieces.\nThere is also a whole wall dedicated to a study of icebergs, and\nthe series entitled \"Attempting to\ndeal with time and space\" will\nmake you laugh even if you don't want to stop and ponder.\nAlthough you could spend hours in this gallery, trying to\nunderstand every significance of\neach photograph. Many of the\nstudies are interesting at just one\nglance and they encourage at least\na minute or two of contemplation.\nWith a few exceptions, these artists\nhave managed to avoid the pretentious contrasts of some modern\nartists and the result is a neat\nexhibition.\nDemelza\nInstitute of Contemporary Art\nThe Mall, SWI, Charing Cross tube\nShowing until 15 March INSIDE\nCarol Robertson and\nHelen Sear\nYes, but is it art?\nPhoto: Virginia\nT he new exhibition in the ante\nroom gallery is about a million times better than the\nprevious one. This is the best thing\nI can say about it. Sure, it's very\npretty, but is it ART?\nThe exhibition really is completely innocuous stuff, consisting\nof some geometric patterns, photographs of bird-cages with light\nshining behind them, more photographs this time of fossils, all the\nsort of thing that you' d expect to\nsee in a kitchen or a bathroom, not\nan art gallery. It's very middle\nclass, tasteful art. 1 liked every-thing, but only in a passive way.\nIt's not art, not really. It didn't prompt any strong emotions or\nreactions from me at all, which\nsurely is the point. At least \"bl an ket\", the previous one, made me\ncross. \"Inside\" is a fairly restful\nexhibition, so if you've had a long\nday, go in and gaze at the pictures,\nand feel waves of inertia wash over\nyou. Otherwise, don't bother.\nJulia H Ante Room Gallery, Sherfield\nUntil 1 1 February\nHOT MIKADO\nCXWMS Light Opera Soc\nAnother perk of this job is the\nability to plug your friends'\nproductions. Hot Mikado\nis a re-working of the Gilbert and\nSullivan original, with basically\neverything changed except for the\nplot, which is tortured and very\ncomplicated. The music is in the\n'50s/'60 s rock style, with famous\nsongs such as \"Three Little Maids From School\" scored to sound\nmore like the Beverly Sisters. If\nyou like musicals, this should be a gem. It's going to be very colour-ful, with orange, pink and blue '40s zoot suits. There'll be a review of it\nin next week's issue, so watch out\nfor that, and do go and see the\nshow, I'm sure it'll be great.\nArts Ed.\nHot Mikado Union Concert Hall\n3 - 7 February\n\u00a35, \u00a34 students.\nNot at all insignificant, actually\nPhoto: Seeta\nTalking about plugs, 1 really\nenjoyed DramSoc's production of Insignificance.

This\nis by no means a bad film, but to\nrecommend it to everybody in the\nway they have will result in many\ndiscontented audiences.\nThe film portrays the life of\nVictor Kelly, leader of the notorious\nShankhill Butchers. The gang was\nfeared throughout Northern Ireland\nduring the late seventies after murdering 19 people. Although alleged\nto be Loyalist their victims included\nfive Protestants, demonstrating the\npurely psychotic nature of their\nenterprise.

Just in case: poor boy\nmeets rich girl, they fall in\ni ove and end up getting wet.\nThe question is whether this is\ndone well. The answer, pre-dicta bly, is that it depends on what\nyou are seeking. If you are looking\nfor either a love story or hectic\naction then you'll have seen\nsuperior films. If, however, you want an epic combination of the\ntwo then this is unmissable.\nI he most impressive vi sua Titanic are surprisingly not found in\nthe sinking scenes but in the\nmeticulous reproduction of the\nship's interior. The audience\nreceives a real impression of both\nthe luxury found in first class and\nthe appa ling work conditions in the\nengine room. The love story is\ngiven a full two hours to develop\nbefore the inevitable CGI sinking\nscenes begin, but these are not\nquite as exceptional as the hype\n\u2022id have us believe. But no\nmatt et, for by now the audience\nactually cares what happens to\nthe leads and that alone is\nsomething special. D Chris\nStuart Townsend is given the\ndubious pleasure of playing this\nun likable character. He seems to\nrelish the role, however, and is\nalmost worrying ly effective in his\nchilling portrayal. As Kelly descends\nStuart Townsend. Scary.\nfurther into insanity Townsend becomes more and more be liev able, but unfortunately the storyline\nfails to maintain interest. The only\nreason to keep watching is to enjoy\nseeing him receive his\ncomeuppance. No time is spent on\nthe motives behind his violence but\nwe are given an insight into his\nfamily life and the bizarre\nadmiration he commands from\nevery female he encounters.\nThis week is probably not the\nmost fortunate time to release a film about Loyalist hitmen.\nHowever, director Marc Evans will\nnot be upset if this causes some\nadded publicity. Some of the\nscenes in the Welshman's second\nmajor film seem to have no\npurpose other than to cause con-t rovers y. This is a shame as the\ntime would have been better spent\nexplaining some of the reasoning\nbehind Kelly's actions. An examination of the background to\nIreland's problems might have\nadded to our understanding of\nKelly's behaviour. It may also have\nturned the film into something\nmore memorable than just another\nviolent feature about a particularly\nruthless killer. O Chris\nTITANIC COMPETITION... TITANIC COMPETITION...

Indeed they went a goal down after Jules Porreca needlessly gave the ball away to an LSE\nstriker who ran through to score. It\nwas LSE's only shot on target in the\nwhole game. Imperial fought back\nand were soon level. Warren Brayn\nhad a left-foot drive blocked by the\nLSE goalkeeper, but winger Richard\nPratt was well positioned to\nequalise from the rebound. Pratt\nmight have put Imperial in front\nshortly after, but 1-1 at half-time\nwas probably fair.\nThe second half started brightly\nand Alex Marcos should have put\nImperial in front on more than one\nocc as sion. LSE sporadically threatened on the counter-attack, but did\nnot manage to create a single scoring opportunity. Psycho brought on Germ und Knutsen as Imperial\nlooked for a winner near the end,\nbut a draw always looked the more\nlikely outcome. The sides clash\nagain on Saturday when the Firsts\nwill look for more creative ideas up\nfront.\nICFC 1 1 - 1 LSE I ICFC II v UCL III\nA nearly full team - the only regular\nabsent was Felix ' Toad fish' Schroeder, an upset stomach caused by a dod gy pie putting our\nTeutonic Terrier out of the action.\nWithin minutes of the start, Chris'\nnightmare '98 continued as he\npalmed a shot to the ground at his\nfeet, from where it was blasted\ninto the back of the net.\nIt became clear that we were\nthe better team. A ball from Pat\ngave Si some space, He strode forward towards the retreating UC defence. A neat through-ball\nreleased Pistol Pete who placed a shot over the keeper.\nWe took the lead when Andy\nFerguson's free-kick squirmed through the UC wall and was duly\nburied by Si.\nAndy continued his superb\nform at right-back, james was forced to send an abusive opp osi tion player off, increasing our grip\non the game. With UCL pressing\nfor the equal is era superb break\nsaw Martin put the game out of\ntheir reach with a typical poacher's goal.\nWith promotion looking a realistic goal and the huge BUS A booster against Kingston next\nweek, these are exciting times for\nICAFC seconds.\nICFC II 3 - 1 UCL III\nTruly Scrumptious\n/ would like to apologise for the woeful nature of this headline - Jacob\nRCSRFC v Fulham &\nHammersmith\nWhen the RCS rugby executives\narrived at the Union at 1 2 all that\nwas to be found was a barren\nwasteland. After much moaning and groaning in the middle of\nPrince's gardens by spew t annoy, a small army of 1 3 ventured down to\nthe \"Hurlingham Park International\nArena.\"\nThe game started by ' Nip ply' crashing over the line in true scrum\nhalf style(?) after effective ruc king. The second came rapidly after our\nelusive No.8, not prop, picked up\nand burst through away from the\nscrum half, popping to Nipply who used his amazing passing capabilities to give it to Jon \"Alex?\" Bound who scored under the posts. A few\nstupid mistakes and lapses of concentration enabled the \" Hammers\" to get back into the game.\nIn the second half, continue al pressure from the lycra clad, vase d up PVCed scientists ended with\npenetration of the opposition's banner by our star guest player\nBuffy. The next try came from the\nscrum half's awareness of the\ngame in missing the fly-half, giving\nHoggsy no choice but to 'hoist the\nGary Owen' which he then recovered and popped to Telfa who dived and streched to put the ball\ndown for a\" good five pointer\" (PJ).\nThey then scored a try due to our\nlack of personnel. Man of the\nmatch, for the breaks and wobbling\nof his belly was Spew.\nRCSRFC 2 8 - 1 3 Ham & Fulham.\nICWHC Iv Oxford\nWell we forgot our balls, the men\nwouldn't go with us, and had to\nborrow theres.

Having rightly been\naccused by the rest of the club of\nbeing arrogant, it was time to\nprove that men shall be men. The warm up was done in the\nchanging room as it was too cold\nfor us to warm up outside, A rousing team talk by captain in the Bol\ngot everyone focused. St Barts had\nwon the BUSA merit group 1 and\nICHC II v UCL III\nPlay started and due our their\nvigour, we were awarded a penalty\nflick.

After a couple of goal mouth\nscares, which were calmly dispensed by Bill, l.C. strode up the\npitch and Shaggy stroked the ball\ninto the net, having now lost his\nbig thing. 2 - 0.\nNuff said.

    "content": "10 FEATURE INTERVIEW 30 January 1998\nIN\n2\niI Who runs Imperial\nCollege? We can't really\nsay. Even Simon Baker\nwasn't sure, but he\nknows a man who\nshould be...\nI 'll be honest with you. I was slightly apprehensive\nabout this interview. Firstly, I felt sure that Lynda\nDavies and her cohort of IC Secret Police wouldn't miss this time, and secondly I had heard from many\npeople that the College Secretary was a tough opera-tor. Still, we journalists are always prepared to suffer\nfor our art, so I headed for his office in the inner sanctum of Sherfield, Suite Five.\nTony Mitcheson joined the College in May, having\nretired from the Army at the rank of Colonel. Selected\nf iom over 50 candidates, li<* was [wc vi u us Kri aiming\"'' i \u2022 \\\n:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 ' . \u2022\n-\u2022 - Io< \u2022-\u2022:\u2022\u2022 on si bid for dog .v.d nJ nf on xo oi, of Voodd 'y.r; ino too i.o,e ncc and supplies managing abu cl ger or \u00a33 billion. His\ncareer began in 1 \u00b0 o1 with tuo years at Sandhurst, .mil\no1>/ In i Hertford College, Oxford. Before his final posting, he\nwas responsible for all troops in southern England. He is married with two children and lists his interests as\nHistory, DIY and photography.\nAt first glance, running Her Majesty's Armed\nForces seems a very different job to keeping this place\non inc s rr aig ln and narrow V ke d ho.\\ he had lou rid the transition from overseeing a tightly disciplined\n:\not' ['\u2022!;. \u2022\u201e'.'\u2022 j f stu-dents, he said that he wasn't \"sure if the students are\nthe problem.\" Who could he be referring to? \"It is different. It was described to me before I came here as\nlike 'herding cats.'\" Mr Mitcheson claims that there\nare many parallels to be drawn between the management of the two organisations, though I like to think\nthe Defence of The Realm has the upper hand. Both\nare run on a committee structure - \"the processes are\nvery similar... [there has not been] much of a culture\nshock\" - but he suggested that Army is probably\n\"more focussed in its aim.\" He added, \"there is a sense in which decisions are made more quickly\",\nsomething which few would doubt. Is this a result of\nthe way Imperial is run, or is it symptomatic of academic institutions in general? \" No,1 sense the decision\nmaking at departmental level is very fast. The problem\nlies in that the College is a very large organisation and\nis going through a fairly turbulent period with the medical mergers. From what 1 can see the structure is fine.\nIt's more the sheer number of decisions to be made.\nIt is the degree to which stand-alone organisations are\nhaving to be brought together which is the complicating factor.\" It is certainly true that there is a huge\namount of decision making at IC, but how much of it\nis really necessary, as distinct from those which stem\nfrom inefficiency, bureaucracy and empire building.\nIt is fair to say that most members of College, both\nstaff and students, will have little dealing with the\nCollege Secretary, so many of you will be wondering\nexactly what he does; it seems that even some senior\nSherfield staff are a little unclear on this issue. This\nconfusion is not helped by the fact that each Secretary\nseems to have a different remit. In recent times we\nhave had John Smith, the infamous Angus Fraser,\nPeter Mee and now Tony Mitcheson. While Mee and\nSmith were very much in the traditional mould, Fraser\nwas referred to as 'Managing Director of IC,a role\nthat won him so much respect from the academic\ncommunity that he was effectively forced from office.\nSo in whose footsteps does the present incumbent\nfollow? Though he very wisely denies it, it seems that\nthere are shades of Fraser. Mr Mitcheson described\nhis job as consisting of four parts. Firstly, he is Clerk to\nthe Governors, akin to the role of Company Secretary.\nThis involves servicing the Governing Body and the\nExecutive Committee, which normally would not be\ntoo arduous. However, things have livened up at the\nmoment because of work relating to the Nolan and\nDearing Committees and also the planned changes to\nthe structure of the Governing Body, to be replaced by\na much larger Court of 150-160 people, as you may\nhave read about elsewhere. The College Secretary part\nconsists of co-ordinating the administration of\nImperial, though Mr Mitcheson was keen to point out\nthat his role stops at co-ordination. The Sherfield\ndirectors - Messrs Caldwell, Hansen and McClure and\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022 .\u2022 I. \u2022>oo ;?on in:\nBorne parts of that building. The similarity with Angus\n\u2022ra ser stems from the assumption of control of\n:\n- ' i'.:;.i,,i and,>' \u2022\n.\n:\n'\n'\n-.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 'firms\n1,10 sus j\"!<n. \u2022\nan unnecessary extra post. \"By the time you've\nemployed a Bursar, it's going to be pretty expensive...\nit was agreed therefore, that we wouldn't appoint a Bursar, and we would continue with me covering that\nrole.\" He did add that \"[the plan] has been shelved...\nit may be resurrected.\" Since he believes that the\npressure ol work makes him 're a cri w rather than\nproactive\" in this role, it may yet rise from the ashes.\nThe ff i u.l part of his job relates to the St. ret ary of the\nSchool of Medicine, of which more later. Another\nrumour suggests that Mr Mitcheson's role will be\nre styled as Deputy \u2022Rector; for administration, denied\nby the man in question, o The medical merger is clearly the biggest issue\naffecting the College at the moment. As 1 have said\nuntil blue in the face, this gives us the perfect opportunity to rational is e the whole way that the College is\nadministered. Somewhat frustrated by the Rector's view on this, 1 was delighted to see that the new boy\nhas an altogether more encouraging viewpoint.\nAcknowledging that they may be short term rise in\nnumbers and costs - the new School of Medicine will\ncost \u00a3 4 8 0 , 0 0 0 per year more to administer than pre-merger- Mr Mitcheson said that it; should happen\n\"over time... there obviously shou id be some scope\nfor rational is ation, but that is obviously not the aim of\nthe exercise. The aim is to achieve a better academic\nresult.\" And what better way to achieve that than by\ndiverting money from administration to teaching and\nresearch. An early sign of cost saving was the\nremoval/resignation bf-'fK i'i u ii a rij 'iA^^ the Medical\nSchool Secretary. Despite compelling evidence that\nthe Coll e^lSe petar y is of the opinion that these\nposts should not be separate, he denied this. He\nbelieves that the differing needs of the School of\nMedicine will require the post to be filled. \"That is not\na permanent union\", he said, saying that the post has\nalready been advertised. \"The aim is to achieve the\nbest academic outcome by not duplicating structures\nwhere there is no need.\"\nRationalisation is a word that unsettles most pe o ple, save Tor those in Sherfield, who for most part are\n\n"

Steak pudding is just steak and kidney pudding without the kidneys because\nthey're yuk ky and horrible to play around\nwith. If you insist on kidneys then be my\nguests and bung them in, 1 won't say a word.\nNow, the only way to make a good pudding is to use suet. The beef type is unquestionably the tastiest (and is made from the\nfat surrounding the kidneys so there's another weird connection for you. I bet the\nFBI are into this up to their cheesy armpits)\nbut for the health-conscious out there, vegetable suet (which, like margarine, is made\nfrom hydrogenated vegetable oil whose\nhealth credentials are being questioned at\nthe moment) produces more or less the\nright consistency.\nSo here we go. I know, why not start\nwith a list of necessary ingredients:\n<*\" 1 Vi lb stewing steak\n<*' 1 onion\n* Suet pastry - 8 oz plain flour, 4 oz suet\n(shredded or chop it yourself)\n1 tsp baking powder\n\u00ae' 1 pudding bowl, should be ceramic\nGosh! Complicated isn't it? Now time to get\nmucky.\nMix the flour, suet, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a large bowl, crushing the pieces\nof suet between your fingers to incorporate the\nflour. Once the texture is fairly consistent add\njust enough cold water to get everything to stick\ntogether and form a firm dough. Leave to chill.\nMeanwhile, cut the meat into thin strips and\ndip into some seasoned flour (flour plus any\npowdered spices you might have: pepper,\nmace, mustard, paprika, whatever).\nTake the dough and divide it into 2/3 and\n1/3. Roll the larger piece into a round about 'A in. thick and line your greased pudding\nbowl with it. Press the dough all around\nand make sure there aren't any creases\nwhich could pop up and spoil the effect.\nHalf fill the bowl with the meat\nstrips.\nChop the onion finely and fry it in\nsome butter until lovely and golden\nbrown, adding a hefty dose of pepper\nnear the end. Place the onion in the\npudding bowl with the meat, de glaze the pan with half a glass of water and\nadd this juice too. Then put the rest of\nthe beef in with a good pinch of salt.\nFinally, roll out the remaining pastry\ninto a round slightly larger than the\nbowl, moisten the edges, place on top\nand press the edges together well.\nTo cook your cardiac arrest in a dish,\nwrap it up in a tea cloth or two and place\nin a large saucepan with enough water\nto come2/3 of the way up the pudding bowl.\nBoil for 3 hours.\nAntoine\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY Oh come on, you must be able to think of something...\nHaving a column is great.\nThere really is nothing\nquite like the privilege of\nbeing able to air my twisted, bizarre and sometimes merely\ninsane views on any subject I choose. Estimates indicate that our\nbeloved student newspaper is read\nby approximately eight thousand\npeople, giving me the potential\nopportunity to take a step towards\nshaping the minds of the future. Of\ncourse, 1 don't bother doing this,\npreferring to moan, whine and w hinge about whatever has\nscratched me during that particular\nweek.\nThis time, however, the creative half of my brain looks to be\nenjoying a little siesta. It seems that the blok e sitting up there who provides my inspiration has been\nkidnapped by a crack suicide squad\nfrom the other half of my brain,\nwho are going to tie him up and\ntorture him by forcing him to learn\nthe Taylor Series Expansion.\nUnfortunate though this is, it has\nleft me with the more immediate\nproblem of a column space that is\nso depressingly white it would easily pass the Daz doorstep Challenge.\nI decided to take the afternoon\noff, planning to use it to regain\nsome of the sleep 1 lost last night\nwhen two of my cruel flat mates forced me to play Worms2 until\nthe small hours. (They made medo it. Honestly...) Instead I find myself\nwalking up and down the Felix\noffice, watching the usual suspects\ncome and go, and suffering from a very severe case of writer's block.\nAs the afternoon draws on, and the\neditor's gaze darkens, I try many\ndifferent ideas for subject matter,\nwith no success. I refuse to bend\nunder office-wide pressure; I will\nnot write about the bloody sabbatical elections.\nSo I apologise for the lack of a depressing, heavily sardonic and\nmisery-inducing piece this week.\nAll Campbell\nt AIR salON15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS\n\u00a3 1 5 LADIES \u00a3 1 3 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "

It\nrefers not to the price, but to our\neditorial freedom. It has been\nappearing less prominently in recent\nyears, as myself and others have\nbelieved, erroneously it seems, that\nit could be taken as read.\nFelix is not a college new spa per, nor is it a union paper, though\nit receives generous funding from\nICU. It is an independent stu dents' newspaper, it is registered\nas a public newspaper and its content is bound only by national law.\nThese facts are clearly not\nappreciated by many people\naround college, notably those students currently running the Royal\nCollege of Science Union (RCSU).\nFor those fortunate enough not to\nhave read the articles in question,\nhere is a choice morsel:\n\"1 cannot believe that Felix ...\nshould publish an article about the\ndeath [of a chemistry student] on\nthe morning of a chemistry exam\nbefore the official announcement\n... You do not publish articles\nunless you have been told that you\ncan. If you cannot be bothered to\ndo your research first... you should\nnot be allowed the responsibility to\ncarry such stories until officially\ntold you can by College or the\nDepartment concerned.\"\nWe do publish articles without\npermission from college, and to\nsuggest otherwise is ludicrous - if\nwe waited for them to give us news,\nFelix wouldn't be worth the paper\nit's written on. Besides, both the\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies\nin chemistry and the College Tutor\nwere aware of our decision in\nadvance, and respected it without\nfuss. Perhaps if you had done a little\nresearch yourself, you would have\ndicovered and respected the fam i ly's wishes to avoid mentioning the\ncause of death, as we did.\nThe point is that author of published material holds a great\nresponsibility - a fact which I learned the hard way.\nIndependence brings account abi li. ty.

    "content": "30 January 1998\nSINGLES\nVitro - Set It Down\nDance and rock combined, everybody's doing it\nso why can't Vitro. Works well, but this is far\nfrom original.\nCe Ce Peniston - Somebody Else's Guy\nPianos, quality female vocals, this is the David\nMorales Old School Radio Edit! Alleged club\nclassic with an unmistakable hook.\nKinane - Business\nForgettable inoffensive dance that will sounds\ngreat with the volume turned down to a mini-mum.\nDubstar - / Will Be Your Girlfriend\nDubstar have a way with words. Unfortunately it\nseems to be the same way with each single they\nput out. If she was better looking I might be able\nto forgive her.\nMUSIC\nDave Hollister featuring Redman + Eric\nSermon - The Weekend\nStarts off well enough, but soon goes downhill\nas it moves from hip-hop to swing. Another\nexample of higher credible artists putting themselves down. James\nSmokin Beats featuring Lyn Eden - Dreams\nSix smokin' tracks on this CD, including various\nremixes. This dance track is pretty good with a good singer on it, but too few lyrics, and some\nnice beats (!)\nHeadswim - Tourniquet\nHardly a departure from the norm, guitar-driven\nBritish indie music... lyrics are nice ... decent\neffort from these guys from their forthcoming\nalbum Despite Yourself. A bit like someone else,\nbut who? We've heard it all before...\nSounds of Blackness - The\nPressure/Hold On (Change Is Comin')\nThe first track is a dance version of the Gospel\nsounds that this group is renowned for. A beautiful voice on top makes it good. The flip side\nhas the lovely original version in all its glory. The\nRoger Troutman remix with the voc oder makes\nit much more upbeat and most people should\nlike this one.\nOran Juice Jones featuring Stu Large - Players\nCall\nThe self-styled player from the 70s in full\nmack in' mode with this nice tune. Changing his\nplayer ways, singing this song for his girl, this is\nwonderful. The flip side has the track Let's Stay\nTogether, where he gets back together with the\nwoman he cast off from the earlier track.\nUnusually, it's just a beat with him talking with\nhis girl. Back to the old school.\nConvert - Nightbird\nThis week's dance favourite. It's got it all. Basic\nformula, lyric less vocals, and the mixing mans\ndream of a constant beat.\nEarl Brutus - Come Taste My Mind\nSenseless Things music, new vocals. Highly\nacclaimed Earl Brutus may have more appeal,\nbut their career will probably be just as short\nlived. However, they do win the cover of the\nweek award. Look out for the tattooed man with\nthe bra on.\nUNBELIEVABLE TRUTH - Higher Than Reason\nA Faithless looking cover with sub-standard\nindie-pop on the inner sleeve menu. If only all\nbands could be as good as The Verve\nTHA BOMBI\nFamily of Free Love - Days Like These\nDecent uptempo record... but it sounds too\nsimilar to many groups nowadays. Good background music ? Perhaps.\nDawn of the Replicants - Candle Fire\nThought this would be some kind of future-age\nmusic but it turns out to be more indie.\nAverage... but it seems that there are too many\nindie tracks coming out trying to sound like the\nsuccessful groups. It's a new turn on the usual\nsongs about a woman. It could grow on you. Superstar - Every Day I Fall Apart\nUptempo track with an irritating chorus that will\nstick in your head. The much sombre haunting\ntunes on Every Second Hurts is much different\nand much better.\nAbove the Law - Adventures of.../X.O./ Clinic\nNiggaz\nClever laid back production by Cold 187um complementing the incisive lyrics from the\nCalifornia's Above the Law. Well worth checking\nout.\nUsher - You Make Me Wanna\nThis R8J3 track has been massive in the clubs for\na while, finally gets its UK release packaged with\nthree mixes as well as the original hit, which was\nnumber one in the US for the summer and is a contender for that title over here. Produced and\nwritten by Jermaine Dupri, it should appeal to\neveryone, for its uptempo style and catchy\nlyrics. A definite must - have. H Roni\nWhats up II! The return of the Tha Bomb, I'm back! Hope you all caught the last issue of\nFelix with the special review of the year, a whole fucking page - 1 must be moving up in\nthe world. Yeah, I know it woz a bit late but\nthat was nothing to do with me, I had it finished before Christmas, but the boys at Felix\nhad some problems and you all know how the\nstory ends. But hold up the story don't end,\ndue to lack of space the 'phat selection of 97'\nmissed out last week, but here it is now! The\nessential selection - if you disagree, I don't give a fuck - you need to have these tunes, if\nyou ain't got dem get your arse into gear and\nget them.\nI ain't got much time so just a quick few\nthings Usher, blowing up all over and\nnow even over here, released last week and\ngoes straight in at number one, whats' hap-pen ing? Everybody in the know woz chatting\n'bout this years ago and the record company\nseems to have got the message and released\nit. Its success has been huge but its only been\nout a week and it'll be interesting to see\nwhether it holds up or just drops out of the\ncharts. Those who know me know the way I feel about Will Smith, funny guy, but why does\nhe continue to release this pop style music,\nout this week is 'Getting Jiggy With It'. It's doing the rounds in the clubs and will probably do pretty well in the charts, but really its\npoppy shit. The Brit Awards - Method Man's gonna be there, doing his thing on a duet with\nTexas, she's sings he raps, any good? I'm gonna wait to hear it, and then decide. 'No,\nNo, No, No' by Destiny's Child this did the\nrounds late last year, and I hear it and hated\nit, but its slowly grown on me and got to\nadmit I may have been wrong, if you checked\nit and didn't like check it again, and thrust me\nthe more you hear it the better it gets. Alright\nwell I gotta go, so much more shit to tell y 'all,\nbut 1 just don't have the time.\nSee Ya Next Time\nMilen\nTha Bomb - Phat Selection of '97\nMo Money, Mo Problems - Biggie feat.

It is available in either a mixed tape or CD,u n mixed double CD or sex tuple t vinyl set.\nDJs Daz S a und and Trevor Rockcliffe mix it up in a back to back style, these two internationally renowned DJs mix the\nalbum to perfection.1 did not realise looking at the\nplay listings how many true classics\nthere are on this compilation. I did\nnot know the names, but as soon\nas I listened to this CDI recognised\ntune after tune, from back in the\ndays when I just called everything\nHardcore and you' d get Techno\nTrance tracks played along side\nDrum & Bass tracks.\nThere are some massive tunes\nfrom the early rave scene on here,\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nsuch as D Shake's Techno Trance,\nG TO' s Pure (energy), B Sides\nMagic Orchestra, Fierce Ruling\nDiva's Rubb It In, Quadrophonia's Quadrophonia, Second Phase\nMantas m, CLS Can You Feel It, to\nname but a few.\nAs you progress through the CD things get more up to date with\ntracks such as the almost timeless\nThe Age Of Love - The Age Of Love,\nAdfahrt: Come Into My Life and\nMari mon's Schoneberg. So this is a collection of some of the biggest\ntunes over the past seven years,\nmany of which you' d have a job\ntrying to find on 12\".\nSo for those vinyl junkies out\nthere, the vinyl pack is a bargain, as\nthis really is full of classics. Not like\ntoday, where every new release is\nhailed as a classic before it has\neven sold a copy. And for those of\nyou who went out raving in the\nearly 90s, there is plenty on here to\nbring the memories flooding back.\nA definitive collection of the\nTechno Trance sounds since 91',\njust showing how much influence\nthe React label has had over the\nyears, and they are still going strong. Jo Public.\nDJ KRUSH & TOSHINORI KONDO. (R&S)T his album brings together DJ Krush of Japan, a well respected figure in the\nHipHop community and Toshi nori Kondo, both from Japan, a leading figure in the\nJazz scene and a professional trumpeter since leaving school.S owe have a hiphop jazz fusion thing going on. DJ Krush once again delivers a wicked assortment of cold chilling\nbeats, breaks and scratching, true\nhip-hop flavours as always. This\nhas a very strong jazz flavour,\nwhich is sometimes too much for\nme, but it all blends together very\nwell.\nMUCH U slows the pace from\nhip-hop to a more downbeat tempo, a totally laid back number,\nwith a various array of sounds used\nto soothe the soul, and the trumpeting skills of Kondo used to full\nadvantage.\nThe pace is lifted again quickly\nwith FU-YU, a head-nodding foot-tapping, funky hiphop thing, I found the trumpeting a bit too\nover-powering, slightly spoiling it.\nThe pace is slowed again with\nSH OHKA, mellowing things out,\nwith the slow rolling beats.\nBU-SEKI finishes things off in a fine style, excellent scratching 8.\nmanipulation of records, strong\ncrisp beats, but once again, for me\nto much jazzy trumpeting. Which\nyou may have noticed by now.\nI found that the more downbeat tracks worked the better, than\nthe faster hiphop style tunes.\nMaybe this is simply due to the\ntrumpeting being not so overwhelming and intrusive as with the\nfaster tracks.\nIt's a shame they went for such\na full-on jazz direction, instead of\nsome of the tracks having a jazz\ninfluence, all the tracks are well and\ntruly jazzed up. 1 must say it surprised me just how jazz up this\nalbum is, after hearing much of DJ\nKrush's previous work.\nThis album seem to be aimed\nat jazz lovers more than hip-hop /\nbreakbeat lovers.\nJo Public.\nEXPERIMENTAL TECHNO house w garage Finitribe\nFrantic Remixes (Infectious)\nThe CD boasts a wider range of remixes to the\nvinyl. The sad thing is that I prefer them all to the\noriginal. From the menacing drum'n 'bass sound-scape conjured up by Scissorkicks tot he dreamy\ndub by downbeat creation of Cut La Roc; from\nsome acidic old skool electro by Al people to to\nloads of crazy beak beats from Micro speech; from the murky depths of Witchman's haunting\ndownbeat adventure to some blunted hip-hop\nbreaks by Laidback. There is something here for\neveryone but the purist.\nRyuichi Sakamoto\nAnger/Grief remixes (Ninja Tunes)\nA prelude to the veteran Japanese composer's album of modern instrumental music, this ep\nboasts some of the wildest musical experiments\nthat I have ever witnessed. Amon Tobin creates\na viciously dark drum'n 'bass piece out of Grief\nthat left me breathless. Anger has been included\nin its original form, a confused barrage of sound\nthat hits the listener from all angles. The remixes include fierce breakbeat s from Rare Force, an\nun describable \"Orchestra vs sampler\" contest\nfrom Chocolate Force (aka T Power) and Talvin\nSingh's amazing tabla'n 'bass effort, apa cy piece\nof genius. They say anger drives and inspires the\nbest of a breed. Here's the evidence...\nOrlando Voorn presents the Stalker\nBlast EP. pt 2 (Fierce!)\nReleased Feb.\nPart 1 features mixes by Freddie Fresh. This EP\nboasts the production talents of Soma's Funk\nD 'Void. His interpretation of Blast is characteristic of his sound; smooth, deep and harmonic.\nMy favourite tracks are those offered by\nOrlando on the flipside (Phunk=Phunk and\nBurning Passion). Both are abstract, quirky and\nyet extremely dance able pieces of music.\nLee Grainge\nIsland Life EP (Human)\nThree stunning tracks on the debut outing for\nthis label. Evil Knevil creates a big atmospheric\nsound; an electronic collage that will fire up\nyour imagination. Winter is a softer ambient\npiece. Skating on Thin Ice is a lovingly-crafted\noffering, deeper than the first two. It is obvious\nfrom this ep that melody and mood are important to Lee. Music like this doesn't often appear\nso don't waste your chance.\nUltratubes vs Pierre\nHorspielmusik 03 (Horspielmusik)\nFour tracks with un pronoun c ably long German\nnames. However the music is great! You'll find\nhard techno with strange frequencies wiggling\naround, rhythmic electro, minimal funk and\ncyber sonic craziness. Check this out.\nGus Gus. Sasha mix.\nPolyesterday Out Now.\nSasha gives this tune the deep- breakbeat y house treatment, plenty of time-stretches,\nechoing vocals &. strong break-beats. This track\nalso has a trance y feel to it, but not as hard as I would have expected from Sasha, it never really\nseems to get going, just rolls along. Not really a floor burner, more of a pleasant journey.\nMarco Zaffarano. The Band.\n(Silver Planet). Out Now.\nThe Way Out West mix is truly great, the best\nwork they've done in a while in my opinion. They\nhave transformed the track into a wicked break\nbeat affair, almost sounds D& J3 at first, but goes\nin perfectly with a standard house tune. Clever\ndrum patterns, squelch y sounds, stretched b lines, time-stretches, tight precession s and\ntrance y tendencies. Totally refreshing.\nBeanfield\nElectro-Kraut remixes Vol I( Compost)\nWill these remixes spoil an already great piece of\nmusic? In the capable hands of two lans we\nhave two top quality tracks. Mr Pooley smooths\naway the edges, leaving a slick piece of early\nmorning house music. Mr O 'Brien injects his\nquirky breed of electronic jazz, and maintains\nthe depth. Also check the DMX Crew for a mellow piece of subtle electro. Al;ck\n\n"

    "content": "30 January 1998\nffe g4 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix, SEXISM RIFE Dear Felix,\nFirstly I would like to express\nmy agreement with the editorial\nfrom last week [ 16 January]. 1 know\nthat many students at Imperial\nCollege must be able to relate to\nthe issue put forward, as I certainly can. London is a horribly isolating\nplace at times and sometimes when the pressure is on, it is easy\nto feel overpowered and to see no\nway out of a situation. 1 too would\nlike to see more services set up to\nkeep in touch with students who are not attending college and to\nhelp those who are distressed. A good example of the problems\nwith IC's counselling facilities is my own experience last year. It was just after my exams and I was feeling terribly distressed and isolated.\nI felt I had no one to talk to about\nit, and so I went to see two separate counsellors. One at Princes\nGardens and one at the Union.\nBoth were convinced I must have\nterrible financial problems it\nseemed that was the only problem\nthere could be! I agree that financial issues are something that\ncounsellors have to deal with a lot\nin London and are very important,\nbut these counsellors didn't even\ntake the time to ask what was wrong with me before launching\ninto their advice on Student hardship funds etc. The whole episodes\nmade me feel like my visits were a waste of time and I ended up feeling worse than before.\nMy other reason for writing this\nletter concerns the marking systems at this college. My mother\nlectures at a university where they\nuse a marking system in which\neach student has a number instead\nof using their name (rather like a library PIN number), this eliminates\nany problems with prejudice or discrimination (racial, sexual, or 'just\ndon't get on' etc..) This system\nshould be implemented for laboratory work ( in tutorial work it is\nimportant for the tutor to assess\nindividual students throughout the\nyear). As a girl Iam often speaking\nwith assessors for laboratory projects where the assessor in question speaks mainly to the male stu-dent/s and rarely to me even\nthough Iam also doing the work or\nthe experiment. At worse I have\nmet assessors who will not even\nmake eye contact with me or sit\nand chat to my male co-students\nwithout ever directing a word to\nme or listening to what I have to\nsay. I have even seen occasions\nwhere the moderator and assessor\nof an experiment were 'best friends'\nand in these cases the moderator\nwould not dare to change the\nassessors mark. I did wonder how\nthis idea of a more impersonal\nmarking system could incorporate\ndirectly assessed laboratory work,\nbut a friend had the idea of separate assessors and marks for the\nlaboratory and write up work, thus\nremoving the problem. I agree that\nit is impersonal to be known as a number, but it would only be for\nthe duration of the marking and\nany interviews and discussions\ncould be held later.\nIam interested to know what\nother students and particularly professors think of my idea and whether it would be possible to\nimplement it in the near future.\nFrom my point of view the prejudices in assessors marking work\ncan make all the difference to a final degree result.\nAnon.\nPhysics 1\n1\n1\nDOD GY DEALINGS Dear felix,\nBe on the look-out for people\n(2-men, early twenties) selling\naudio-speakers from the back of an\nN reg white van.\nThe sellers are con-men trying\nto pass off equipment described by\na HI-FI dealer as \"absolute rubbish\nwe wouldn't pay a penny for\", as\nexpensive, high-quality goods.\nIn particular beware of Omni Audio products.\nON YER BIKE, SECURITY Dear Felix,\nMay1 be permitted to have a moan in what I consider to be my \"local rag\". I cycle to work [in\nPrince's Gardens] but have to ride\nalong Imperial College Road and\nthe joke about nuns riding across\ncobble stones comes to mind and\nwould make me laugh if I didn't have to concentrate so hard in\navoiding all the dangerous\nobstructions on that road.\nToday my colleagues had to\nprevent a workman from sawing\nthrough my security padlock to\nremove my bike from the railing\noutside my office. 1 was told not to\nleave my bike there but to padlock\nit outside Linstead Hall where all\nthe other bikes are regularly van-dali sed. You will appreciate that 1\nwas not keen to do that so 1 now have to park my bike in the basement of Weeks Hall and this means\ncarrying it down a flight of concrete\nsteps. Not too difficult for strapping young students but a pain for\na geriatric secretary like me. Does the college really want\nme to contribute more to the pollution and parking problems in this\narea? What is so wrong about\nparking bikes outside one's place of\nwork on a pavement which can\naccommodate both my parked\nbike and pedestrians without any\nproblem? Please don't tell me it\nlooks unsightly because I could\npoint out that the scaffolding\naround 9 and 10 Prince's Gardens\nlooks twice as bad and has been\nthere for several months.\nLorraine Davis\nResidences Secretary\n/ too had my bicycle removed for\nno apparent reason when it was\nparked outside my office in Beit\nQuad. I have attempted to\nreclaim it several times, but the\nguards on duty consistently\nrefuse to unlock the store.\nOh, and that scaffolding's not\ngoing anywhere [Felix 1093]. Ed\nDOUBLE DOH! Dear Felix,\nSomething I forgot to add to\nyesterday's letter [Felix 1 104] is\nsimply that, if the sports editorial\nwas a joke then a)my original missive becomes irrelevant and b) your\nsense of humour is really shite.\nCheers\nNick Oliver\nFELIX Issue-1105. \u2022;/\n30 January 1998\nwv i/w. s ii. ic.-ic.'.uk/i eli x;'i<\".

Four one-year-long union\njobs are available, for which students are invited to run for ele c tion.\nSabbatical ele c, tion papers have\nnow been up a week,\nand four candidates\nhave so far put up\ntheir names. Simon\nCooper (Composites\nPostgraduate) and David Hellard\n( Computing/ Maths II) are running for\nDeputy President\n(Clubs &. Societies)\nand ICU President\nrespectively. Neither Situations Vacant\ncandidate has a proposer as Felix was going to press. Felix learned on\nWednesday that Jon Lambert, ICU\nCouncil Chair, would also be standing for ICU President but has yet to\nsign up. \"I 've got a lot out of the\nunion for my four years here,\" he\ntold Felix, \"And it's something I want to do.\" He seemed sanguine\nthat there would not be a repeat of\nlast year's triple-election rounds.\n\"Most of that after the first round\nwas people seeing what would happen, and they did.\" He felt that\nhis biggest challenge was \"a whole\nload of medical students on cam pus, and we're stretched enough as\nit is.\" Mr.Lambert had yet to find a proposer or second ers, but said\nthat \"it was in the pipeline.\"\nTwo candidates are running for\nFelix Editor; Alok Jha (Physics IV)\nand Ed Sexton (Biology III).

He also expressed a desire to\nchange the format of the ICU\nHustings (Monday 16 February) to\nallow more debating and questioning between the candidates.\nOn the subject of New Election,\nrunning for all posts, Andy Heeps\nexplained that it was only there for\nstudents dissatisfied with all the\nthe four current sabbatical incumbents\nsitting pretty Photo: Virginia\ncandidates, and that it shouldn't be\nrun as a campaign. Last year saw\nthe presidency remaining vacant in\nthe March1997 voting; despite\ntwo extra rounds of elections the\nvoters still chose New Election.

    "content": "14 MUSIC 30 January 1998\nCLUBSCENE - THE UNDERGROUND MUSIC GUIDE\nThe mid 1980'$ saw two styles of music from\nAmerica causing a stir over here in Europe.\nOne was the abstract, conceptual electronic\nmusic from Detroit which became known as\ntechno. The second, from Chicago was more\nparty-orientated; a hybrid of gospel, soul and\ndisco. This was house.\nBoth found their way to our shores at\napproximately the same time. However it was\nhouse that made the biggest impact, initially.\nThe early records of the genre were not only\nnightclub smashes, but even found their way\ninto the pop charts. Steve \"Silk\" Hurley's Jack\nYour Body is a notable example. Detroit techno was equally as important to the development of modern electronic music, but that's another story.\nDuring this period, Chicago was a party\nparadise. The records fuelled the party scene,\nand the party scene inspired more artists to\nput out new records. DJing developed from\nchanging records to mixing, scratching, and\nother turntable techniques. Single-handedly,\none city lit a flame that would fire up the\ndance floors of the planet.\nThe original innovators (Frankie Knuckles,\nFarley \"Jackmaster\" Funk, Adonis, Fingers\nInc., Marshall Jefferson, etc) were creating in\nthe true sense of the word. Here was a totally fresh approach to making music - sam-pl ers, synthesizers, drum machines. There\nwere no rules to be obeyed, and the only limitation was the imagination of the creator.\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think that\nmusic is stagnant nowadays, but we probably\nwon't see such a complete transition, executed in such a pioneering way for a long time.\nOne of Chicago's main house labels at\nthis time was Trax. Many of the original\nartists claim that if it wasn't for Trax we\nwouldn't have been able to enjoy musical\nmoments such as Your Only Friend from\nPhuture, Mr Fingers' Washing Machine,\nAdonis' No Way Back and Farley \"Jackmaster\"\nFunk's Love Can't Turn Around.\nTrax was the collaboration between Larry\nHerman, a successful entrepreneur, and the\nyoung artists and DJs who had so many ideas,\nbut no capital to produce them. Larry, a former musician himself, put his faith in their\ntalents. Thus Trax was born.\nThe late 1980s saw House move into new\npastures. Acid captured the mood of t ranc ing to dance. Described as the second generation\nof house, it consisted of a slower and more\npsychedelic groove.\nAdonis\nTrax enjoyed a string of hit records and\nmany of its top artists are still going strong\ntoday. One might expect Trax to have decided\nto obtain some of the commercial rewards it\ndeserves and sell its tracks to a major label\nfor large sums of money. But this is a difficult\nprospect for a label whose foundations were\nbuilt on innovation, and the spread of records\nfor the sake of a musical message.\nThis brings us onto Trax UK, a label set up\nto introduce this music to a new generation of\nparty-goers. A series of ten inch singles have\naimed to highlight the importance of the original tracks in today's rich spectrum of electronic music. These are all available now. If\nyou would prefer to pick up some classic\ntracks at a reasonable price as opposed to\npaying extortionate prices for the original\npressings then they come highly recommended from the Electric Cafe.\nI really admire the concept behind Trax UK\nfor another reason. It would be so easy to just\nput out the old classics and market them as\nbeing \"cool then, cool now!\". Of course, this\nwould be seen by many as counter-productive\nto the cause of progress and change, myself\nincluded. The past does contain our roots,\nbut sticking to it can be a very negative thing.\nFrom its beginnings in 1996, Trax UK\ndecided to keep its approach fresh and inter-e sting. So, to complement the ten inch eps\nand two albums (The House that Trax Built I and II) of old material, some of the best of\nartists of today were commissioned to remix\ngive it a new edge to this work.\nYou will find the Advent, Claude Young,\nFelix Da Housecat and the Basement Jaxx, all\naccomplished remixer s and artists on a series\nof twelve inch eps. They have been entrusted\nto keep the spirit and philosophy of the label\nalive and healthy.\nTrax is shaping today's music in its own\nway. By bringing together such a diverse range\nof artists to remix and release on one label, it\nis pointing to the fact that categories and\ncliques didn't play a role in the early days of\nhouse music. A message for today, perhaps?\nIt's reassuring to know that the past and\nfuture of house music is in such good hands.\nI'm lost in music - I'm lost in sound\nToo far gone, ain't no way back\nAs I hear the sound, I wanna go\nunderground\nAs I hear the sound, I wanna move...\nAdonis - No Way Back\nListen to the Electric Cafe (Monday\n02/02/98, midnight to 2am and Tuesday\n03/02/98 10 to 11pm) for a special hour\ndevoted to the past and present of Trax\nrecords.\nMany thanks to Angie @ Trax UK for\ninvaluable help in compiling this report and\nthe show.\nAl;ck\nMarshall Jefferson\n\n"

    "content": "30 January 1998\nFICTION\nBOOKS\nTHE CUCKOO'S PARTING CRY\n17\nAnthea Halliwell\nA DE.RUT1\n: Cue RT IN GT his is the story of one hot\nsummer in the 1930's through the eyes of an eight\nyear old girl called Fidgie. Her narration tells of fishing trips in the\nbay, picnic lunches and a new\nfound friendship with a boy called\nChaz. However her innocent\nremarks about life around the bay\nreveal a disturbing undercurrent of\ndeception and adultery amongst\nthe adults in her community. Whilst\nFidgie concerns herself with her\namusement in the day and the\nopportunity to escape from her vindictive elder sister Cly, there is tension building up around her. Fidgie\ncombines a naturally inquisitive\nnature with spirit and seems to pick\nup pieces of the puzzle but being\neight years old doesn't always\nrealise the relevance. The real story\nis what is happening around Fidgie.\nThis is a cleverly constructed novel\nwith only snippets of information\ncoming through Fidgie, but the\nreader can deduce more of the\nstory whilst leaving Fidgie in conf u sion. The reader wants to ask ques-t ions, but an eight year old looks\nfor different answers, hence this is\nan unusual novel where reading\nbetween the lines is as important\nas the text on the m.An the a Halliwell manages to successfully\nreveal her character is at ions to the\naudience but not eight year old.\nThis is an enjoyable read that is well\nconstructed with strong characters\nand intriguing storyline. Perhaps a different genre to your usual read\nbut 1 would advise you to give it a try.\nClare\nPublished by Black Swan\nPrice \u00a3 5 . 9 9\nOut now.\nWe've all been naughty boys and\ngirls, apparently. Our Home\nSecretary, Jack Straw (a previous\nNUS President), says that we are\nin the grip of a 'profound sense of\ncynicism'. He has the sense not\nto blame us for it: it was the\nTories' fault of course, their\nrecord of self-serving indulgence\nn Government is actually at the\nroot of the problem. This is however an admission of sorts that\nthe present Government has not\nyet dispelled what they had\nhoped to do earlier, allowing\nthem to regain the trust of the\npeople to govern more effectively.\nTony Blair has enlisted Jack Straw\nto bring this message to the pe o ple. Straw has been 'New Labour'\nsince before 'New Labour' even\nexisted - calling for the scrapping\nof Clause Four while John Smith\nwas in charge. Other contenders\nto bring this message across have\nfallen by the wayside: Gordon\nBrown and Robin Cook have had\nunfavourable media attention\nrecently, and John Prescott is said\nto have enough on his plate\nalready.\nJack Straw has a job on his\nhands. Tony Blair has called for\npost-honeymoon speeches by colleagues as a result. Although his\npopularity is still as high as ever,\nhis party's showing in the polls displays a growing sense of unease\namong the public. But why should\nthis be? After all, our economy is\ndoing wonderfully, rather better\nthat the rest of Europe (who are\npresently mutilating their\neconomies to fit EMU criteria that\nwe could achieve fairly painlessly -should we want to). Labour majority in the Commons is as stratospheric as it was in May. Britain is\nshowing a resurgence in popularity\nabroad - the Government should\nbe laughing.\nPerhaps the problem lies with\ninexperience in Government, and\nwe are simply witnessing the\nteething troubles of what will be a perfectly competent admin is tra tion. I would suggest that it goes\ndeeper than that. In many ways\nLabour are still behaving like an\nService work for them, tried to\nreplace them and it hasn't worked. The aforementioned assistants are\nhired personally by the minister. If\nhe rises, so does the assistant. If\nthe minister is fired, then the holiday is over for the assistant. This\nbreeds faint loyalty for the\nGovernment at large - witness\nGordon Brown's 'boot boy',\nCharlie Whelan, and his foul-mouthed insults hurled at Downing Street which came to the attention\nof the press last Autumn.\nOther problems with ministers\n' - f Hamish Common\nWestminster Eye\nOpposition party. When they\narrived in Government they set\nabout changing some fairly fundamental ways in which the machinery of Government itself works,\nand it seems some of these decisions would have benefited from a little more forethought as to the\nlong term consequences. The\neffective replacement of civil servants by political advisor, spin doctors (call them what you will) has\nmeant a slight improvement in\nday today media manipulation,\nbut when hell breaks loose, stories\ngot out of a hand and press attention increased. Ministers, rather\nthan learning to make the Civil\nhave been their lack of appreciation of the public effect of their\nactions. When the Lord Chancellor,\nLord Irvine, spent \u00a3 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 of tax-payer's money on his own apart-ment, he should not have said that\npublic will thank him for it. Perhaps\nPeter Kilfoyle, the Public Service\nMinister should have thought twice\nbefore ordering his chauffeur to\ndrive 200 meters from his\nWhitehall office to Parliament, then\npulling over to the side (on one of\nLondon's busiest roads), shouting\nto an old friend: \"Look at this -great isn't it? Want a lift?\" What\nwas Cherie Blair thinking when she\nflew out her personal hairdresser\nwith her on a trip to the States?\n(Although she did pay the flight\nherself). That and the figures spent\nin 'modernising' ministerial offices\n- \u00a3 1 7 , 0 0 0 for air conditioning here, \u00a3 6 5 , 0 0 0 for re decoration there, and it doesn't make for\nhappy reading in Downing Street.\nHowever it taking the issue\ndown to the level of student politics (dare 1 say it) for the media to\ndespair too much at ministerial\nspending. Some of the inverted\nsnobbery by ministers (the\nChancellor refusing to wear black\ntie for City dinners) makes the justification of expenditure more diff i cult, but the root cause of much\noffice re decoration at least was the\nTories' refusal to spend much on\nit, for fear of being accused once\nagain of extravagance. Paddy\nAshdown' s rather pompous calls\nfor 'a certain frugality ... even\nmeanness' should be ignored. The\nGovernment of a country such as\nours should at least be able to provide offices and accommodation\nfor its most senior members in a style which their position deserves.\nOn the subject of the spin doctors\nand political assistants, Tony\nBlair's message to the Cabinet not\nto get bogged down and to see the\nwider picture will hopefully not be\nignored. It would be a pity if the\nGovernment was brought down with completely self-inflicted political wounds. "

    "content": "30 January 1998\nMOTORCYCLE MANIA\nARTS\nTHE ART OF THE HARLEY\nBarbican Art Gallery\nA Harley-Davidson yesterday\nThe Harley Davidson motorbike\noriginated from the garage of aMr William S. Harley and aMr Arthur\nDavidson in 1902. The first bikes\nwere robust and purposeful\nmachines intended to withstand\nthe rough roads of turn-of-the-century America.\nAround 1945, the first customised bikes started to be produced and from that point on, the\nhonest iron workhorse of America\nwas lost in a sea of chrome, ape-hanger handlebars and fat bob tanks.\nThe 'Art of the Harley' follows\nthe history of custom ising through\nits many different styles, from 'bob-ber' (a basic stripped down look) to\n'chopper' (HUGE front forks) to\n'low rider'( short-arse s only). The\nlatest styles are all about enclosed\ncar-type bodywork with streamlined curves and vivid paint-jobs.\nThe 'Ferrari Bike' is impressive, if\ncompletely over the top. In total,\nthere is an assortment of about\nthirty customs, each with a quick\nnote about their custom is ation. The\nnames, however, are worth the\njourney alone: 'Hogzilla', 'Flight\nDeville' and 'Tribute to Stevie Ray\nVaughan', all with high amusement\nvalue.\nUnfortunately, for genuine biking fans like myself, there seemed\nto be an absence of what one could\ncall 'real bikes'. The bikes on show\nwere clearly never meant to be ridden on the roads and were more\nart exhibits than functional motor-bikes. Harley's claim that their bikes\noffer you a \"man and machine riding experience\" was not realised in\nthis exhibition. The blurb intended\nto convey the ethos of the tattooed\noutlaw - a person in control of their\nown destiny etc., but looking at the\nglitzy, razzmatazz of the bikes on display, I was unconvinced. Frankly, these customised bikes are\nas born to be wild as a very nervous\nlaboratory mouse. A typical owner\nis more likely to spend the afternoon polishing their 'Frisco-style'\ntanks than actually riding. The\nmere thought of salty British winter\nroads must set their arms twitching\nfor the Turtle Wax and chrome\ncleaner. A quick glance round\nestablished the identity of the\nclean-cut Harley follower: a bunch\nof middle-aged Sloanies, including\na couple in squeaky clean leathers\nwho obviously hadn't been riding\nanything more rebellious than a black cab that day. To confirm my\nscepticism, the gallery funnelled us\ninto a well-stocked shop selling\nbranded T shirts and jackets. Is the\nHarley image all just one big marketing exercise? Despite the flamboyance of the display, the exhibition is actually enjoyable. The\ncraftsmanship is simply superb, so\nforget the fact that you are looking\nat a motorbike, and let your eyes\nfeast on a banquet of glittering\nchrome and tech nicol our paint-work. It is worth going just to\nimmerse yourself for an evening in\na sea of quite sumptuous if slightly\nlurid colour. Go on, let your eyes\nlive, and give them a break from the\nsensory deprivation of college concrete grey. For just \u00a33, with student ID, it's a bargain.\nAs to what I think of the 'art' of\nthe Harley? Not much better than\na candy pink X R2 with smoked\nglass windows and a Max Power\nsticker...\nBen Rogers\nThe Art of the Harley\nBarbican Centre EC I Tube: Barbican\nUntil 26 April\nnternational\nRight'*!\nCom peres required The Overseas Students Committee is looking for com peres to help host\nInternational Night, which takes place on Friday 13th February.\nSo if you think you are charming, confident,\nwitty and not afraid of performing on stage -Come along to auditions to be held in the\nGreat Hall on Sunday, 1st February at 1.00 pm.\nor contact N 'Diorel on 0956 59 02 05, or email nh d@ ch Jc.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "30 January 1998 NEWS\nLife is \"But a Dream\" for ICU Boat Club\ncontinued from page one\nBill Mason, the club's coach,\nwas also pleased with the\naward, stating that the Lottery\nSports Fund has \"recognised we are a centre of excellence\". He views the grant as acknowledgement of the club's impressive achievements and its consistency at all levels. The award\nmakes up only a minority of the\ntotal cost of the project, leaving\nIC responsible for the remain-der. Bill Mason answered accusations of disproportionate allocation of funds by referring to\nthe gruelling work regime\nadopted by club members. He saw the project as just reward\nfor those such as their internationals who train 15 times a week regardless of conditions.\nMr. Mason feels the project will\naddress current problems of\n\"overcrowding\" and in some areas \"primitive\" facilities.\nThe Boat Club's future\nprospects have been further\nbeen further enhanced by an\noffer from Carlton Television for\nan alternative boat race involving\nImperial College and another\nforce in British rowing in the\nUniversity of London. Although\nplans are only at an \"infancy\nstage\" it is likely the event will be\nheld 3 weeks before the OxfordCambridge race. The high profile event could attract lucrative\nsponsorship deals and boost\nrecruitment. Bill Mason assessed IC's prospects in the\nrace as \"excellent\" and is convinced the event will represent a \"new dimension of university\nsport\".\nSri Lanka comes to IC\nAROSHA BANDARA\nParadise was brought to the\nSherfield ante-room as the Sri\nLankan Society staged a one-day\nexhibition on Wednesday 21\nJanuary.

For those\nwishing to sample some Sri\nLankan food, there was also a variety of snacks\navailable together\nwith cups of Sri\nLankan tea.\nFor the organ-is ers, the event\nwas a resounding\nsuccess. \"This is\na very important\nyear for Sri\nLankans,\" said society President\nAmjad Saleem. \"We are celebrating\n50 years of independence and this\nexhibition is only the beginning of a series of events to mark this occ a sion.\" The society also said will be\nhosting a charity dinner and dance\non the 7 February, raising money\nfor essential medical equipment for\na rural hospital in Sri Lanka.

    "content": "8 FEATURE 30 January 1998 30 January 1998 FEATURE\nAndy Heeps\nICU President\n-On August I st. Imperial\nCollege permanently\nchanged. We stand on\nthe brink of a new century, a century where\nthe world's leading sci-ent is ts, engineers and\ndoctors will all come\nfrom Imperial College.\nThis change is good.\nGood for ICU and good\nfor the Constituent\nCollege Unions, as it\nprovides the perfect\nopportunity for us to get\nwhat we, as a collective\nwhole student body,\nneed. However, this can\nonly be done if wc put\ndogma and previous disagreements behind us.\nFresh momentum, fresh\nideas and fresh initiatives\ncan unite the student\nbody a gam st the useless\nbureaucracy that exists\nwithin Sherfield, and get\nresults.\nThese fresh ideas will\nnot come from any old\n'Union hack'. The\nstrength of ICU that currently exists needs a fresh face to provide\nstrong leadership and\nprepare the Union for\nthe many tough decisions that lie ahead. A new broom is required\nto sweep the cobwebs\naway, and to concentrate the work of ICU in\nthe areas where you\nwant it to be directed,\nnot where a clique of\nCV-till crs think it would\nbe best placed. ICU\nshould be inclusive, not *\nexclusive, and provide a service, not prove to be\na hindrance.\nAs President. I will make\nit my priority to ensure\nthat ICU provides you\nwith the services you\nwant. I don't want to see\na Union divided, which\nputs Club against\nSociety, and Constituent\nCollege against\nConstituent College. I want a Union where my\nvoice makes a differ-en ce, my opinions\ncount, and my needs as a student of the country's leading college of\nScience. Technology and\nMedicine are met. I want\nthis for you.\nThis isn't some flash-in-the-pan bid for glory, I'm going to be at Imperial\nfor a good time to come,\nand I want to see ICUy*\nwork whilst I'm here. /\nCan you describe your job?\nAlthough effectively 'the boss',\nmys job is more akin to that of a puppet-master - keeping ail the\nstrings together, and making the\nUnion move as a coherent single\nentity. Also the 'ultimate representative' of the Union, any\nPresidential hopeful should have a macabre passion for committees,\nbecause they take up half your\ntime in the job. The President is\nalso ultimately responsible for\nabsolutely everything that goes on\nwithin the Union, from its finances\nand staffing to elections of Officers\nand making the office coffee in\ntimes of stress.\nNot really as glamorous as it\nseems, the President is also the\nfirst point of contact for whining\nmembers of the public, moaning\nprofessors and disenchanted\ndirectors of Estates, but in the end\nit's all worth it because you really\ncan make a difference.\nDo you think you've fu filled the\npromises made in your mani-fes to? The promises I made were really\nyear-long promises, nothing short\nterm, and I'm well on the way to\nachieving what I set out to\nachieve.\nHow do you feel about taking a year\nout of your studies?\nThis was the hardest desc is ion to\nmake actually, especially as 1 was\ncoming away from the campus i was familiar with. But, then, l Ve got another four years to go, so it\ndoesn't really feel as if it's going to\nmake that much difference really.\nHave you enjoyed the job so far?\n90% of the time, yes I have. Of\ncourse, there are times when I feel\n1 just want to walk away from it all,\nbut then, everyone feels like that\nsometimes. 1 am generally happy\nwith my job.\nWhat advice can you give to anyone\nthinking of signing up?\nPeople really shouldn't look on the\ns abb act ical year as a fill-in job. I think the two most important reasons to do the job is to make a difference to the Union, and to provide services. If you want a easy\nyear out, go travelling around\nIndia, go to Africa, dont be as abb. Rob Clark\nDeputy Pres. (Finance & Services)\nstop\nmf ht.st r cr \u2022u ring my four years at\nImperial 1 have noticed\nthat there has been a steady decline in the\nnumbers of students\ntaking full advantage of\nall the available facilities\noffered by Imperial\nCollege Union, Many\nstudents automatic al!)' assume the Union will\nalways be there to\nfinance the clubs they\njoin, and provide the\nservices that they take\nfor granted. The recent\nloss of the Union Book\nStore to Watcrstones\nshows how quickly a Union trading outlet can\nbe suddenly replaced,\noverturning many years\nhard work by staff and\nstudents committed to\nensuring that the best\npossible service and\nwidest range of stock\nare provided. I intend to\nstop this trend by\nstrengthening the\nUnion's trading position\nwithin College.\nIncreasing awareness of\nexactly what the Union\nhas to offer students, so\nthat every member\nunderstands the need\nfor a strong and financially independent\nUnion is also a high pri-or it y. experience I have\ngained while running IC\nRadio and being a member of Union Finance\nCommittee,\nPublications Board and\nHouse Committee, puts\nme in a strong position\nto understand\nUnion finances,\nthe course of my\ndegree I have also\nworked for an industrial\nresearch lab preparing\nlaboratory test rigs and\nassisting in the tendering\nprocess for contracts.\nAdditionally in the five\nmonths before\nChristmas of this year I was working as part of a scientific sales team\nwith responsibilities for\ntechnical support, fore-casting, market research\nand various other\naspects of customer\nsupport and sales. 1\nbelieve that over the\nlast 4 years I have\ngained the experience\nto do the job of Deputy\nPresident (Finance and\nServices) well and I hope f will receive\nsupport.\nthe ^ J Mr. During\n! your jj^j f$& Sadly, Rob Clark couldn't be\narse d to write us a job\ndescription. We were, how ev er, able to keep him still long\nenough to ask him these\nquestions:\nDo you think you've fulfilled the\npromises made in your mani-fes to?1 deliberately didn't promise\nanything in my manifesto, but\nyes, I think I 've done as much as any s abb. Have you enjoyed the job so far?\nYes, 1 have enjoyed it. i 've\nfound it very hard work, but it's been very fulfil ing. What advice can you give to anyone thinking of signing up?\nThe best advice I can give is to\nremember you're a link in a chain, and you must allow people to carry your work on. You've got to be able to pass on\ninformation, so that things\nkeep going.\nThe DP(F&S)' s main\nrole is financial.\nThey are responsible\nfor all the money spent by the\nunion (about \u00a3 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year), a responsibility which\nconsists mainly of preventing\nanyone from spending it.\nThe services of the Union\nbars, catering, advice,\nminibuses etc. also come\nunder their remit. The combination of these two branches\nresults in them spending\nmost of their life in some\ncommittee or another.\nThe DP (F&S) is also expected\nto keep a general eye on the\nunion, hold the fort while the\npresident's mind is on higher\nthings, and to do their best to\nprevent College from pinching\nany more rooms.\nPromise to do my best Felix talks to the current ICUs a bbs to find out what they' re up to and whether they kept their promises... Jeremy Thomson\nFelix Editor\nTell me about your job.\nIt seems more like a hundred\njobs than one, most of the\ntime. Put simply, I have to\nensure that a decent newspaper hits the streets every Friday.\nTo do this I need to be an edi-tor, a writer, a designer, a personnel manager, an advertising\nmanager, a DTP expert, purchasing manager, director, sec-ret ary, print manager, computer tamer, postman, union\n'hack', bin-emptier and hardest\nof all, a one-man complaints\ndepartment. All this would drive\nanyone insane, but I 've also got\nto try to remain calm and friendly to avoid scaring off\ncontributors, and acting is not a strong point.\nHave you fulfil ed the promises\nyou made in your manifesto?\nLet me have a look at it... Ah, it\nappears to be a complete load\nof wank. That'll be a yes, then.\nHave you enjoyed the job so far?\nIn patches. I 've always been a bit of a slacker, so working seventy or eighty hours a week\nisn't really my cup of tea. The\njob can also get highly stressful\nif you let it - your responsibilities are enormous and the\ndeadlines are always looming.\nOn the other hand, I 've\nachieved a lot and it's good to\nknow I'm working for a good cause, not myself.\nWhat advice can you give to anyone thinking of signing up?\nThink hard. The job is highly\ntraumatic, and if you can't cope, you're very likely to suffer\nCongratulations You're\nreading a sabbatical election manifesto. You're\nbetter informed and more\naware than 50% of the\ncollege population Before\n/ lose your attention, let's talk about the fun stuff.\nENTERTAIN\nMusic, theatre, the big\nscreen, arts, books,\nclubs and more. Felix\nmay be a student paper,\nbut it produces up to\nthe minute reviews to\nrival many nationals. I 'll\ntry to make this popular\nsection more diverse\nand comprehensive.\nThe apathetic among you\nmay like to turn to the\nmore light-hearted SFTW\nnow. because the next\npar i is serious.\nINFORM\nGreat change is\no imminent at IC.\nWhole departments and\ncampuses are shifting in\nthe largest developments since the 1960s. There is opportunity,\nbut also risk that the\nneeds and wishes of the\nstudents and their union\nwill be further margin-a lise d,I believe Felix has\na duty to inform - so\nyou know about the\ndecisions that affect\nyour life, and your opinions will be heard.\nIf you've got this far, 1\nsuppose you really are\ninterested. In that\ncase...\nI want greater student\ninvolvement. Felix has a great deal to offer students directly. It provides opportunity for\naspiring writers, photographers, designers,\nreviewers and columnists to sec their work\nin print. It offers experience in finance, advertising, and research. It\nhas excellent production\nfacilities. It's a diverse\nsocial centre. Plus, it's the perfect place to eat\nyour lunch-time curry.\n/ m not making any specific election pledges.\nInstead, I promise to do\nthe job to the best of my\nability so that you get\nwhat you wont. I believe\nthat I can succeed, but I need your help. Make it\nhappen!\nnervous breakdown (which I don't care about), and severely,\nor perhaps permanently da mage the newspaper (which I do).\nThe real skill of the job lies in\ngetting on well with your staff. I am responsible for motivating\nunpaid, voluntary students to\ndo the work of ten or fifteen\nfull-time professionals.\nGood luck!\nCharlie Joynt\nDeputy President (Clubs & Socs)\nSo, what do you do, then?\nHmmm. I'm ultimately responsible for the running of the\nUnion's many clubs and soci-e ties. With most of the administration duties borne by the\nC&S Administrator, the bulk of\nthe work is regarding development strategies and representing the Union Clubs and\nSocieties to College. Health and\nSafety, student training, provision of sports, giving advice -the list goes on - it's all in a day's work.\nDo you think you've fu filled the\npromises made in your\nmanifesto?\nSo far, yes, 1 think I have. We're\nworking on an ACC ball,\namongst other things, but of\ncourse, I won't really be able to\nsay for sure until I 've left the job.\nHow do you feel about taking a year out?\nFine. In my case it was an easy\ndecision. It's given me far more\nenthusiasm for my course, as\nI 've had time to take a serious\nlook at things, and put them in\nperspective. People who are\nkeener on their courses than I was will probably find it more\ndifficult to make the break. I'm pleased to have done this, and\nI'm glad that I 'll be here to see\nthings go through, and to give\nany help to my sucess or. Have you enjoyed the job so far?\nYes, certainly. I 've been busy, but\nthe work is absorbing and chal-leng ing. What advice can you give to anyone thinking of signing up?\nInterviews by Julia Harries| It is ffc surprise that much of\nI our a&ct ali smg is based\nSaro u id the societies that we\n\\ join.\u00a7A/ e have over 180 clubs\n\u2022 that lf ve can sign up for, and\n^mos i of us choose to be\nnr ern be rs of a few of them at\nthe very least. With the\nmergers of the medical\nschools, and next year's integration of ICSM into the\nSouth Kensington campus, we\nmust strive to broaden the\nwidth of the clubs on offer,\nand to increase the depth of\nparticipation in them.\nParticularty as Imperial is a science-based college, we\nmust encourage social and\nartistic societies to maintain a healthy balance of interests.\nMany of our sports teams are\nexcellent, with international\ncaps for many of our rowers,\na BUSA win for fencing and\nindividual championship wins\nfor members of the Karate\nclub, to mention but three\nteams. With proper coaching,\nsponsorship deals, better\nequipment and improved\nsporting facilities, there is no\nreason why our sports clubs\ncannot imp ntr emend ou: At Imperial, there is mu> emphasis on academic work,\nbut we must balance this\nproperly All too infrequently\ndo we have successful dinners and balls. Anyone who\nhas witnessed Wednesday\nnights in the bar cannot deny\nthat an ACC or RCC dinner\nwould not be as successful as\nthe already popular OSC\n'International Night'.for me as\nICU Deputy President, and all\nthis will happen. I am enthusiastic and experienced in the\norganisation of clubs - as 3rd XV captain I am responsible\nfor over 40 rugby players and\nhave managed to field a4 th XV for the first time m recent\nhistory. 1 stand for your best\nDon't do it if you aren't motiva t ed. You have to put in long\nhours and have to be on the ball,\nas problems crop up quickly and\nhave to be dealt with quickly. 1\nwould suggest that anyone\nthinking of signing up should\ncome and see me to get an idea\nof what they would have to do.\nIf you've read these interviews,\nand think you might like to have\na go, the deadline to sign up is\nFriday 6 February. The current\ns a bbs will be more than happy\nto chat to you about the jobs,\nas they're all rather hoping to\nretire on ! August this year.\n\n"

Of course,\nhe eventually came clean and\nfound that honesty, albeit after\nthe event, did him no harm at all.\nThe suggestion that Robin Cook's shenanigans are 'of no consequence to the general public\nwhatsoever' is a little naive.\nWhen a member of the Cabinet\nuses public funds to pay for a mistress's travels, and apparently sacks a Foreign Office employee in order to give her a job, as\nhas recently been alleged in the\nDaily Telegraph, I feel it is very\nmuch the concern of the public.\nFurthermore, when one reads,\n'families are the core of our soci-e ty... the breakdown of family\nlife damages the fabric of our\nsociety' on page 25 of the Labour\nmanifesto, it\nreinforces the\nidea of double\nstandards. I have\nnever believed in\n'trial by tabloid',\nchoosing to read\nnewspapers edited by those who\nhave mastered\nmulti syllabic words, and it is\ncertainly true\nthat some of the\ntabloid tactics\nagainst both parties are reprehensible. Nevertheless, Labour\nshould realise that the moral\nhigh ground is a very tricky place\nto occupy. As I indicated in my\narticle, the fact that Robin Cook\ndid the dirty on his wife is in\nitself irrelevant, but when looks\nat the supplementary actions in\nthis case, his behaviour becomes\nunacceptable, hypocritical and\ndenigrates this important office\nof State.\nWhile we're on the subject of the\nmanifesto, Ashton, let me\nsuggest that\nyou pop across\nto Chemistry\nand read my\ncopy. New\nLabour is not\nabout 'remain-ing true to its\nsocialist ethic'\nChanging~~*' Clause IV can\nI| hardly square\nwith what you\nYour leader said 'in\neach area of policy a new and\ndistinctive approach has been\nmapped out.' You say on one\nhand that Labour won because\nof Conservative mismanagement\nof the economy (so bad that\nhave said.\nLabour chose to stick to\nthe spending plans), and\nthen go on to say it was\ndue to 'remaining true to its\nsocialist ethic' You can't have it\nboth ways, Ashton. Dragging religious values into politics will\nalways end in ears, for it\ninevitably degenerates into\nmoral ising and puritanism. Given\nthe broadly non-religious nature\nof the country, it is never long\nbefore resentment develops.\n'Back to Basics' was never my\nfavourite policy of the\nConservatives. After being\nshamelessly rebadged by Blair\nand Mandelson, it still holds little attraction.\nFinally, it is nice to see that ICU\nis capable of keeping up with\nCollege trends, despite the\ngreater fiscal firepower of the\nlatter. I refer, of course, to the\nlovely new signs on the ICU\nStore. Radiant? Certainly.\nInformative? Without doubt.\nStraight? Well, two out of three\nain't bad.\nTHE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO GETTING A FIRST with COLIN DALE\nPart Two: Lectures\nCan you hear me at the back? I said, Can you\nhear me at the back? Oh well, never mind, this\nweek's installment is about lectures. These\nexist primarily as an opportunity for departments to keep their most incompetent members of staff occupied for a few hours a week.\nAlso, by judicious timetabling (e.g. one at nine,\nand the next at five), students can be forced to\nspend vast amounts of money at College catering outlets in order to sustain themselves during the intervening periods. From a less gratuitously cynical point of view, they represent an\nexcellent chance to hear the central ideas of\nyour chosen subject presented by those at the\nforefront of advances in the field. But don't despair: it may still be possible to make constructive use of the time.\nThere are a variety of techniques used by\nlecturers to get the material across, but they\nrely mostly on boring and confusing the audience into a kind of hypnotic submission. As a rule, the content of a lecture is designed to be\neither insulting ly obvious or beyond the comprehension of mortal men; never anywhere in\nbetween. The classic non-exam in able derivation is a favourite crowd-please r.No self-respecting lecturer would ever begin without\nhis trusty overhead projector, so named because any information displayed on it is\nguaranteed to go completely over the heads of\nthose at whom it is projected. Their popularity\narises from the fact that they allow almost infinite scope for getting transparencies upside-down, back-to-front and completely obscured\nby chalk dust. Sometimes, you will arrive at the\nlecture theatre to find that they have dragged\nout an incoherent old buffer to talk irrelevant\ndrivel at you for an hour (to replace the usual\nincoherent old buffer). This is called a guest\nlecture,.and usually occurs after you have been\nwaiting around for it all afternoon with nothing\nto do. Other special entertainments may be\nlaid on. I once saw a brilliant farce in my lecture theatre, called 'Mathematics for Physicists'.\nThe only character was a burbling physics lecturer whose ineptitude was so great that he\nhad to cover four boards with corrections to his\nprevious lecture. The protagonist has since\nbeen made a professor. Another time, I saw a graphic reconstruction of what it might have\nbeen like to visit an eighteenth century freak\nshow. It was called 'Electromagnetism1\n.\nBut I digress. By mercilessly ripping the\npiss out of our respected staff I seem to have\nbeen forgetting my duty to give useful advice.\nIn future I will make more effort to keep to the\nrule, 'business before pleasure'. So here are\nsome tips:\nYou don't have to spend your entire course\nbeing threatened and intimidated by your lec-tur ers. You need to show them who's boss. Try\npicturing them in their underwear. (Actually,\nno, that would probably unhinge you completely.) The best line of attack is to laugh\nheartily at all their jokes (if you can spot them).\nThat'll really scare the shit out of them and they\nwill do anything you say, even move the board\nup if you fall behind copying the notes.\nProjectile banana skins are another tried and\ntested method of keeping them on their toes.\nHowever, there is one thing more scary than a dull un motivated lecturer, and that's a highly\nenthusiastic one. He is quite a different beast.\nTo deal with him requires careful planning and\nco-ordination. Take aim with tranquil lise r darts\nmaking sure that you have friends sitting near\nthe front ready to close in with nets as the\ndrugs begin to take effect.\nBut even with docile lecturers you need to\nmake a supreme effort to concentrate. There is\nonly one sure-fire way to get anything out of a lecture at IC. But be careful: even possession\ncarries a mandatory two-year sentence.\nWhen your enthusiastic desire to copy\ndown every valuable word of wisdom has worn\noff (i.e. after you've sat down), you will want\nsomething useful to do. I recommend an informative little booklet called Ten Interesting\nDiversions Involving Pen Tops and Rulers. You\nmay also like to contribute to the ongoing and\nhighly-informed graffiti debate about the relative merits of Guilds members and their sexuality by engraving the word 'Bollocks' into the\ndesk.\nBut at the end of the day, don't forget that\nyou will be examined on all your courses.\nBribing the examiners is not generally a good\nidea. You will inevitably be sent before a special tribunal whose silence may cost up to ten\ntimes as much as your original offer. So on\nsecond thoughts 1 suppose you'd better start\ntaking some notes. Any questions?\n\n"
