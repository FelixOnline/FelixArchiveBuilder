    "content": "2 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nSir,I was prodded by C.h.H. to write something\nfor FELIX the other day. If you don't like the\nenclosed it's his fault for asking.\nA. F.J., \"Won't you write something for FELIX?\" he asked.\nJust because,\nYears ago when FELIX was only a kitten, And didn't know any better,\nThey printed\" a poem of mine.\nI'll write him a letter. \"Comments are invited on this subject\"\n- That's the thing.\n\"Deer Sir,I\".... wonder how many irate indignant authors,\nGlowing with white hot thought.\nFind it solidified after three words?\nI'll write about sport.\n\"The X club has made a good start to the year... We started with b fresher s now we have a+b( Where a is just> b). We've won all our matches - but two\n(We've only had three).\n\"Won't you write something for FELIX?\" he asked.\nI 've written.\nBut since they've not printed such drivel for months\nIs all this in vain?\nOne thing is certain, that if he reads this\nHe won't ask me again.\nHi LOIi*.JN_^\u2022 ...here to eat\nSir,I was seriously dismayed to read in FELIX of\nNov. 9th that an article on \"Where to eat around\nI.C.\" was contemplated. Although only a fresher\n(min) I had been quite successfully altering my\noutlook radically when I saw this news. I had\nbeen obeying the injunction in the Calendar to \"\n\"belong to I.C. clubs in preference to outside\nclubs\". I had been cutting out visits to the\n(too proletarian!) cinema in preparation for\njoining i. c.f.s. instead, and so on. I was also\n(though unavoidably a green ticket e er) relinquishing a hitherto vivid interest in the World .\nand People in general^ and fast becoming absorbed\nexclusively in Imperial College as advocated by\nimplication by your original correspondent on\n\"green ticketing\".\nThen to my disgust I discovered that the\neditor of FELIX considers it permissible, even\ndesirable, to eat elsewhere than at the I.C. Refectory Club. Surely in view of general I.C. policy this is a most pernicious and deplorable\nsuggestion and I can only hope that I.C. will remain as isolated from and independent of the\noutside world as it has been in the past.\n* Surely not ticket er racket:racketeer: : green\nticket: green ticket e e.r! Yours truly,\nN. Sijdrawde.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE CHRIST;.. AS CONCMRT\nI.C. Choir and Jacques String Orchestra\nConductor : Dr. Reginald Jacques\nat Queen Alexandra's House, Thursday,\n29th November 1951, 7.JO. p.m. Programme will include Xmas Oratorio Pt\nII by Bach; Madrigals and Carols, and Handel's Concerto Grosso for Strings.\nTickets 3/6 and 2/6 are now available,\nfrom the Union Office &c.L.U. D.S. Final arrangements are now under way for\nthe LU.B.3. production of \"Lazarus,\" ScottMoncrleff's translation of the three-act drama\nby the modern Italian playwright Piran dello. Last season'sL.U. D.S. production at I.C. saw them out of the red for the first time for\nyears. Following on this success they are\nputting on their new play at the Watergate\nTheatre, Charing Cross. Chris McKoen, who will be remembered for his performance in F.6., is producing the play; Lucio, the principal male\npart, is to be played by Lawrence Miller( I.C.)j the female lead, Sara, mother of Luclo, is being\ntaken by Edna Carson (I of E). The college is well represented, so there\nBhould be plenty of I.C. support for this new\nventure on'December 4th9 th inclusive. COLLEGE RiiGS OR HOOLIGANISM\nDear Sir, It is evident that you support the frequent\nthoughtless assaults on the law-abiding public\nby students.\nOn almost every occasion that these \"r.. gs\"\ntake place, some innocent member of the despised\nproletariat is seriously inconvenienced, or,\nas so often happens, is caused unnecessary\nexpense by the damaging of his pr her clothes.\nAre the hooligans who perpetrate these outrages to be excused, nay supported, on the grounds\nthat they are University scholars?\nIs it commendable that a business man on his\nw j iy to an important conference should L< prevented,\nor at least delayed, from doing so, during the cause\ncourse of a rag?\nIs the vandal to be encouraged who spoils beyond hope of renovation the newly-purchased costume\nof a woman by stand cr in Piccadilly by covering her\nwith a mixture of soot and flour?\nThese incidents are not mere fabrications or\njust isolated examples, but, with many others, of\na similar brand, are the events that have been\ngleefully related to me by some member or other\nof a college \"expedition\".\nI, and I am sure other thinking students\nwill agree with me, heartily deplore your support for this type of behaviour. It .is certainly not for the 'good of the public', as you so gli bly put it, that outside rags should be allowed to\ncontinue. However, qualified encouragement should\nbe given to k orph y Day and other INTER-COLLEGE\nclashes, as they allow the more boisterous among\nus to \"let off steam,\" the qualification being\nthat the inoffensive onlooker is not involved.\nYours etc.\nJ.D. Ault,\n(R.C.S.) Sir,I am entirely in agreement with the article, in your last issue, on Rags\". Their present\ndeplorable state was Illustrated by the debacle\nat U.C. on November 5th. It had its moments,\nbut they were very few, and came only after a two hour warming up period. There was quite a good turn-out on a dreary night, and with a little organisation we could almost have taken 'U.C. apart, brick by brick, removed the surface of\nGower Street to a depth of six feet, and filled up Trafalgar Square with the rubble, policemen\nand all. I repeat \"Roll on Morphy Day\", but let te have\na little less misdirected high spirits and a little more efficiently planned action. Yours,\nfeeling strongly on the subject,\n\"iggy.\"\nThe Editor takes no responsibility for views expressed\nin Readers' Letters. Correspondence is invited, but\nshould be as brief as possible.\nSir, The present arrangement of the Coming Events\ncolumn looks prettier than the previous one, but\nconveys less information. Down here, in the\nwild3 of Berkshire, it would be preferable to\nhave the classified list of events (including\n'ordinary club activities) under their appropriate\ndates, as, owing to the way in which club officers\npersistently ignore the existence of Silwood, little news of what is going on percolates to us. My\nparticular grumble at the moment is that I never\nknow whether the next Saturday is a hop Saturday\nor not, and I cannot drop in to find out; .\"drop-ping in\" means a5/ coach fare. We are inter es ted in club activities, but we cannot arrange our\nvisits to London to suit them; it is a question\nof going to what happens to be on on the days\nwhen we are \"up from the country\". So if this heartfelt plea does not have any effect on club\nofficers, perhaps you coul i manage'to give us\nthe information through your columns.\nYours etc. Joan M. Slow\nSilwood Park,\nlii th November, 1951\n(We became aware of a failure to give\n'Hop' details and this will be rectified. We also intend to put more items in 'Coming\nEvents', but we cannot list every item of\nregular events as anything of special interest\nis then swamped. Editor)\n\n"

Congratulations are due to the four athletic clubs\nwhose teams have sucessfully disposed of their opponents\nin the first rounds of the U.L. Cups.

In\nthe meantime readers are advised to consult\nthe athletics clubs notice boards for results\nnot published on this page.\nHOCKEY\nU.L. Hockey Oup 1st Round\nImperial College 5 St. George'a Hospital 0\nI.C., by a remarkable recovery in the last fifteen minutes of toe game, have come success-fully through the first round of the U.L. Cup,\nbut it was a recovery, or perhaps I should say\nan awakening, that might well have been too late\nagainst more formidable opponents. That the\nI.C. goalkeeper was scarcely troubled during\nthe whole game is an indication of the good\nwork done by the halves and backs, particularly by the halves, and the real weakness for the\nfirst three quarters of the game, during which\nno goals were scored, lay with the forward play.\nI should have liked to have seen fewer in divi dual spurts and less scooping of the hall, and\nmore hard hitting and swinging of the hall across the field, so that one could have seen\nthe forward line more down the field as a line, and as a fast line too, for the pitch was not\nin a very bad state.\nIn the last quarter of the match there\nwere some good passing movements and some very\ngood hard hitting, and shooting in the circle combined with&ou e fast following up, in marked\no on tra st to the first' half, when it was pitiful to see the ball bouncing off the opposing goal-keeper's pads and the I.C. forwards waiting on\nthe circle for the goal keeper to pass the ball to them. It is not always necessary to break\nthe goal-keeper's stick, but this occurrence\ndid at least indicate that someone was tackling\nhim hard'.\nI.C. have a long-standing and high reputation to maintain in University hockey and it is going to be difficult, but the closing stages\nof this match show d that they can do it, and we\nwish them the very best of luck in future games,\nboth cup matches and otherwise.\nA.S.! UJ3\nGOLF\nIn the golf match between London and Cambridge Universities at Sunningdale Golf Club,\nLondon University scored 3\u00a3 points to Iki by\nCambridge. Of the 3y points, Imperial College\ngolfers, R.H. Hoenan and K.W. Glover scored\n1Jr. Heenan scored a victory over Sustaao '\nCrawley who is probably the longest hitter, in amateur golf, while Glover halved his match\nwith J. A. Alexander.\nBogey (?) Man\nSOCCE\nUNIVERSITY OF LOUDON ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL CUP\nI.C.6 West Ham 2\nI.C. won their first round cup match com-fort ably, but the game was not ao one-sided as\nthe score suggests.\nThe game started at a fast pace with I.C. playing the better football. I.C. went ahead\nafter five minutes' play, Modge finishing off a good passing movement by the forwards, and continued to press the West Ham defence, but, fol lowing a break away, West Ham equalise d with a fast ground shot. I.C. quickly took the lead\nagain with a goal by Clenshaw and then attacked\ncontinuously without being really dangerous.\nWest Ham equalise d with a high lob and I.C. then had. the misfortune to Itfse their goalkeeper,\nwho, suffering from an earlier injury, had to\ngo on the left wing. The speed of the game\nslackened and play was mostly in mid field, no\nfurther goals being scored by half time.\nClenshaw scored I.C.'s third goal immediately after the K.O., and soon after obtained\nhis hat-trick with a shot that gave the goalkeeper no chance. 1 . 0 . then had complete cont r olof the game and played very good football. Clenshaw scored two more goals, making his\ntotal five. On this form I.C,, should dp very well in the cup this season, all eleven players\n'having a very good game.\" \"But special mention\njnu st be made of Clenshaw and Ward who, de put i sing in goal, made two grand saves.\nI.C. meet N. fi,C. on 1st December in the\nsecond round of the cup.\nSQUASH\nThe form and fortune of the squash teams\nso far this season has been 'changeable. The\nfirst jt je am started the season well with a50 defeat of King's, but followed this with a narrow\ndefeat 2 - 3 by Lensbury and a crushing 0 - 5\ndefeat by a very strong Wimbledon team. They\nthen visited St. Catharine's College, Cambridge,\nwhere none of the team seemed to find their form on the unaccustomed and very fast courts,\nand were inexcusably beaten 2 - 3 . In their next match, however, they beat Ashtead away in an extremely close match, 3 - 2 .\nThe second team this year have proved keen\nand promising, and the competition to get into\nit is considerable. They have so far won\nagainst College of Estete Management 1st and\nIbis2 nd, and lost to Lensbury 2nd. The newly re-formed University club are\nthis year running a3 as ids knock out to urna ment, and in this our team got through the first round, against Wye College, on the afternoon\nafter the Wimbledon match. U.D. Martin at No. 1 won his tie108,96,97, but\nA.R. Warner, playing at No. 2 with a septic\ntoe, lost9?,39,108,79,79. However, &. M. Hughes, whose form this year has\nbeen variable and who was ' atrociously unfit\nafter a mild attack of' flu.,, surprised the\ngallery and himself by winning810,95*97,109. Our chances of winning this tournament are difficult to assess because the\ndraw Includes several hospital teams whose\nstrength is not known. However, if we survive\nthe next round against Westminster Hospital, we arf hoping that the team will be strengthened\nafter Christmas by the return of Jeff Kenyon,\nand if he can quickly get back into practice\nwe should stand a reasonable chance.\nE.M. H. BADMINTON On.Saturday Cambridge University H beat\nImperial College let team 5 - 4 . I.e., were\nwithout Lau, who was playing for the University, and the match was as close as the score indicates. The 1 st and 2nd couples won two matches each, and the 2nd couple lost all three.\nThe I.C. team hope to reverse the score when\nthey visit Cambridge in February.\nPublished by the FELIX Board, Imperial College Union, London, S.W.7.

RAG 5th NOV.a rainy Eov. the Fifth did not damp the\nspirits of the six thousand students of U. who took part in the rag organised by University College. The rag, which took the form of a procession through the West End, was in aid of funds\nfor the Student Sanatorium. The theme was a suggestion that Great Britain should become the49 th State of America, notable among the floats were a\"stern wheeler\" which emitted such realistic smoke that it half suffocated the \"crew\"; ft.\ntwo which carried Jazz bandstand one dispensing free Coca Cola. The procession, escorted by many policemen, made its noisy way down Regent Street, in toPic a dilly Circus and up Shaftesbury Avenue. The\npolice were quite friendly, and afterwards could be seen in groups, laughing over various incidents which occurred during the procession. The presence\nof the \" Black Maria\", which brought up the rear of the procession, showed that they believed in taking no chances. Fortunately, it was never used,\nfor no bags of flour,, or such like, were thrown,\nand the police turned a blind eye ( or was it a deaf ear?) to the many fireworks which were set\noff..\nMeanwhile, about 100 members of I.C., in conjunction with Northampton Engineering College, had attempted\nto enter U.C. by a devious route, and to set the bonfire alight, but U.C., with memories of last year, had\nleft a strong fire-fighting force behind, and despite\nst renO us efforts, the bonfire was substantially intact\nwhen the procession returned. Soon the night was made\nhideous by many college war-cries, and fireworks of all descriptions.

Later her\ninterest in literature led her to join The\nPhoenix Board, where she assisted with the product ion of the magazine. With the more leisure d existence of a post gradin Chem. Eng. Marjorie is playing tennis again, and, as a beginner in the game, is to be found on the squash court aa often as she can find an opponent. It has even been rumoured that she will be seen\non the hockey field before the season Is out.\nMusic, as well as literature, has a great attraction for Marjorie, and she much enjoys\nthe theatre, being a regular patron of \"the\ngods\". While not equalling Miss Sherwood's record of only having missed once, Kar jo rie attends Dinner in Hall frequently, and likes to join a Touchstone weekend whenever she can\nspare the time.\nHer experience as secretary of I.C.'' \u00bb\n'\n.

Despite the precautions taken to\nensure secrecy, we have succeeded in obtaining some details of the new car which, it is confidently expected, will sweep the American market. It \u2022 will out Ford Chrysler, out Eu ick S tude baker, out Pontiac De So to. We are proud to be the first to present the 1951 Super-Zwoom.\nFitting. The car is luxuriously furnished throughout. The fittings being everywhere of the finest quality. In the rear compartment these include home cinema, convertible ballroom/ bathroom, and\ncollapsible swimming bath. The boot is unusually commodious, having enough room for the average luggage of an average\nfilm star, in one half. The other half can be\nsupplied fitted up as a bedroom or kitchen. Plumbing, in all cases, is extra. Bodywork.\nThe body \" is unusually free from sharp corners bends, angles, curves or indeed any shape what-ever. The available finishes include deadly nightshade, repellant yellow, regurgitated green and black. When ordering, please state alternative colour choice. The alternative colour choice must be black. Rear turret. The sole disadvantage of this car is its length, which makes it unwieldy when reversing. This is overcome by the provision of a rear turret, fitted with a complete set of controls. The\nturret is normally occupied by the second chauffeur; an intercom, is supplied so that the two\nchauffeurs need never be in doubt as to who is in control. When moving forward, the rear turret operator will be found invaluable forgiving warn-ing of police cars, making suitable gestures to overtaken motorists, etc. Instrumentation. The dashboard fittings include altimeter, anemometer, barometer, cigarette lighter, radio, television, automatic cocktail shaker, radar screen and complete blind driving equipment.\nRev. counter, oil pressure gauge, and radiator thermometer can be supplied at extra cost, fitted in an easily accessible position under the driving seat. Springing. Each of the eight wheels is independently and\nharmonically sprung, giving excellent and un damped response to any road irregularities. A sim nle adjustment enables the phase and amplitude of each\nspring to be varied: the car can thus be used to perform Fourier syntheses, rendering it invaluable to mathematicians. At certain settings resonance\noccurs, the resulting motion having a laughable resemblance to a Channel crossing. Paper bags\nare provided free. Brakes. The braking system marks a radical departure from normal practice. Upon depressing the foot brake, four stout iron bars, pointed at one end,\ndescend into the ro ad surface at an angle of h$ \u00b0.\nThe car can usually be brought to rest within one\nfoot from any given speed. A disadvantage in the\nprototype was the tendency of the chauffeur to be\nprojected through the windscreen. The production model, however, is fitted with Four plex armour-plate glass, and windscreen breakage is now negligible.( Continued on next page)\n\n"

A strong and potentially powerful crew, they la ok the spring and punch on\nthe beginning which, with precision in timing made\nthem suo h form ldi ble opponents in1950. P. D.R.

This will also\nbe our Second Birthday Issue.\n)py\nB \u00aeANERGES\nTHE BRIGHTON RUN About 8.20 a.m. on Sunday morning Bo left Guilds,\nin pouring rain, for Hyde Park.\nAt 9.03 a.m. we left the starting point on our\ntheoretically three hour Journey to Brighton. It was\nstill raining. On the Journey, the crew, J.R. Howarth, K.J. Neale,\nM.J. Day, D. Thomas and D.J. Gardner were steadily\ngetting wetter. Worst of all, it looked as if the\nadverse conditions were going to make the journey\nlonger than anticipated.\nOur fears about the length of the journey were\njustified and after one stop for petrol and two for coffee we were well behind schedule. This did not\nmatter, as to qualify one has to arrive before 4. p.m. In spite of the wetness, the crew remained happy\nand considerable enjoyment was had from our private\n\"dice\" with W.A.L. Cook's1903 Argyll which we passed\nseveral times.\nWe arrived in Brighton about 2 p.m. after a Journey of some two hours during which it never stopped\nraining. Luckily Bo had given very little trouble. The journey home was uneventful but we did not\narrive until1.30 a.m.P.A.S. Blomfield and I.W. Joffe\ndrove some distance. It had stopped raining. LORD MAYOR'S DAY\nHaving obtained permission by telephone to\ntake up station along the Lord Mayor's route.\nBoanerges set out from I.C.a t10.45a.m., with\nthe President and Corporation of Guilds on board.\nThey made the fastest time to Aldvych that can be\nremembered for any method available, and entering\nthe path of the procession circuited Ludgate\nbefore parking in St. Paul's Fields.( The bombed\nsite). On the arrival of his worship Sir Leslie Boyce, Lord Mayor elect, his Highship the Pre s ident of Guilds, Gentleman Jack Howarth, raised\nthree cheers from the Guildsmen and other I.C. men (and woman) assembled. Then an excellent\nBoomalakka was given and Bo' seen off home, waived\non by the dust-carts awaiting their turn.\nThe President's party arrived back by 1.0p.m.. an indication of a sound performance by the 1901\nworthy. The men of I.C. then followed separate\nways, some remaining with the procession to\nTrafalgar Square - an indication of their sound\nbehaviour. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ FELIX BACK NUMBERS In response to a recent request, copies of\n'FELIX' are now deposited in the Goldsmiths'\nLibrary of the University (Senate House).

WEARNE\nMINES' NIGHT\nWhen the Dramatic Society' s production opens\non Tuesday week, that first night will und ou b ted ly be marked by comment and participation by the R.S. M. section of the\naudience in the 'bobs'. The producer and\nhis company have probably written this off as\n'an extra dress rehearsal under severe\naudience conditions'; in barter for serious play going to the subsequent performances.\nWe would like to echo the Editorial comments\nof PHOENIX ( last summer) which pleaded for restraint from the Mines' Night crowd, to\nmatch the tolerance of the actors,\" for, if the ratio of noise to wit becomes too\nhigh, the play cannot proceed and neither the players nor the wags can be heard\".\nTHE FELIX BOARD\nrtl S.H. Wearne has now taken over the Editorship of FELIX.\nLSince joining the FELIX Board\ntwelve months ago he has taken a leading part in the various aspects of production of the paper.\nHe has also contributed many articles on a diversity of topics first in the capacity of assistant editor and latterly as news editor. I take this opportunity to thank Stephen\nand our many contributors and salesmen for their enthusiastic und unselfish support;\nwithout which FELIX could not, and can not, be produced. Providing that such a team\nspirit is maintained our animal will continue\nto flourish and to grow in stature. J. W. Midgley\nW to hand over FE^IX while ill with,\ninfluenza, so that he was una ble to put everything he wished in.to the changeover. He has retired\" both because his work requires it, and\nbecause he agrees with the experience of the previous Editors: that half a year in the job is enough. He will not\nbe spared a Profile later this year, but before I do\nthis traditional appreciation, it is only right to\ncongratulate him on the health of FELIX. An inherit ance of financial stability leaves me free of the\nworst of the unproductive worries that can gravel an Editor.S H W Views expressed In the Lead ar Columns of FELIX are not necessarily those of College or Union official opinion. THE CULTURE VULTURE\nvur fresher should, by now, be thoroughly per-0 plex ed. At the beginning of term he was\nstrongly urged by his Dean and President to tsk e 'sn\nactive part in the Union: and probably within\nthe last few weeks he has found out (even without\nFHOENLX REVIEW to help him) what is going on.\n&ut soon one term will be over, and the dove-tailing of attractions, commitments and academic\nwork will begin. Our \"Coming Events\" column this\nyear has been redesigned to select the widest\nrange of items of general interest apart from\nthe Sports side, which is covered separately.\nThis list has apparently not been enough to\nattract the mass of students to try at least one\nof these features so easy to hand. Witness the\nattendance at the \"Mock\" Election. We would like to draw attention here to the\nrange of local facilities. Our student may have\nvisited one of the Museums in Exhibition Road, but\nhow many of us know the \"Geological\", \"Science\"\nand \"Natural History\", and have taken our girl to\nthe \" Victoria and Albert\"? We are well-served\nfor music. We have our Musical and Jazz\nSocieties, orchestra and choir. The Albert Hall is on our back door-step, and the Royal College of\nMusic over the road. Admission is free to the\nR.C.M. concerts held every Wednesday at 5.30 p.m. If you prefer a contrast in hops and dances, there\nare the Friday evening hops at the Royal College\nof Art Common Room, in Cromwell Road. , The use of\nthis Union is open to allI.e., and it may\nInterest you to eat there one day next week.\n(Continued i._ next column)\nViewpoint: the hostel\nThe term \"brown-b agger\" was, we are told, coined by H.G. Wells. If only he had been able to foresee the use to which this term would later be put by irresponsible characters who seem bent upon disrupting the small amount of goodwill that remains in Imperial College1 Is it not\nabout time that the eyes of those who inhabit that palatial mansion spoken of in awed terms as THE\nHOSTEL were opened?\nIt has frequently been stated in these columns that the unfortunate student who lives out\nis not obtaining the full benefit of a university education. From a casual observation of the\nhabits of those who are privileged to live in, these benefits are of a somewhat doubtful nature. The usual interpretation placed on a university education is a life in pleasant surroundings in which a man, by having time and leisure to think, to let off steam occasionally and to pursue his. chosen subject, is able to form some sort of\ncharacter that marks him as an Individual. The\nserious minded fresher determined to reap the most\nfrom the opportunities before him is confronted by\na community In which back slapping, noise-making\nand talk of rug ger mark out the leading lights. He sees cliques indulging in adolescent hooliganism in surroundings more reminiscent of an\ninstitution than a university. The impression that he is likely to get ( it may be wrong,but the\nfact that he gets it is what matters) is that here\nwe have a cheap imitation of campus life with its fraternities and traditions that begin with effect from tomorrow. He sees noisy groups\nblustering around the bar and hears second-hand\nstories of PUERILE INANITIES of \"The Boys\". He\nis either so enthralled by all of this \"big man\"\nnonsense that he moves heaven and earth to enter the hostel or he is so repelled that he may well become a brown-b agger in sheer self defence. At almost every Union meeting exhortations are issued to make the full use of one's opportunities and join in the life of the college but\nto the man who doesn't play rug ger and is not\nsufficiently thick skinned to introduce himself to everybody there is very little entertainment in even the most lighthearted organized activities. There has been much talk recently of long-term efforts to make Imperial College entirely residential. These suggestions have obviously been put forward with the best of intentions and\nwill, it is to be hoped, some day be realised, but\nin the meantime it might be an exceedingly good\nidea to do away with the hostel completely, there by giving some measure of protection to future generations from the current\" benefits\" of res i A dent i al university life. SCEPTICUS\nCritic - At tk eDe feet e \"That Women have yet to justify their ema nci nation\" \u2022\nThe annual debate and dance with Bedford College was held last Friday.' As it is one of the mainstays\nof the L.&D. Soc. it is important that every effort should be made to retain a high debating standard. A deterioration in the quality of debate, attributable largely to a lack of preparation was noticeable. The accent being on the sociability of the affair, the motion should be light enough to keep at bay that dull ness which Wilde calls \"the coming of age of seriousness To prevent ra.g6ed ness several members of the house\nshould be briefed and speeches should be worded to\nensure that the battle of the sexes does not become\ntoo repetitive. Too large an audience,too few\ndebaters!'. Our visitors must be thanked for their lavish illustration of their speeches by numerous photographs\ncalculated to appeal to the I.C. eye. They ra.n ged from one chosen from a notable British mens magazine\nto another in a chic outfit which was alleged to cover\nanything that could possibly happen in an evening.\nThe dance, organised with the assistance of the\nEntertainments Comm., which concluded the evenings\nentertainment was not overcrowded - a pleasant change\nfor a Union Hop.\n\u2014 C.A.T.( Continued from previous column)\nThe college has many schemes forgetting students interested in themselves, such as: the\nTouchstone weekends; the Ends and Means Lectures, the programme of which will soon be published;- and\nDinner in Hall, held every Tuesday in the Union. This touch of the Culture Vulture is directed\nat the student who has as yet taken no other\ninterest in the college other than his work. We\ndo know of people, and, we dare say it, post grads, in particular, who have never been to their colD^ ge or I.C. Union meetings. Most of them take\ncollege holidays. Some read FELIX. We hope\nthat you will bring them all to Morphy Day.\n\n"
