Anybody looking for a party\nwill find it here. In fact, we arrived there just in time\nfor 'Street Scene', the annual rock fest. The whole\ntown was totally alive and bands were performing\neverywhere. Bars and cafes were full and the town\nhad a most herbal aroma. Such was the concentration of herb, I felt very light headed on stepping out\nof the bus.\nWe were surprised, no shocked, about some of the laws in California. Firstly, there is a curfew for\n'minors'. Under 18 year olds had to be off the streets\nby 10pm. I won't list the many other totalitarian laws.\nIn general, we stayed out of trouble with the law -aside from a small jay-walking' encounter (see\nbelow).\nat the age of 18 instead of waiting to reach 21 at\nhome. This is another silly law that the US has, but\nhaving drunk American beer, under 21 s really aren't Even the cheesiest of grins won't help you now...\nI was fortunate enough to have a friend who had\ngone to UCSD (San Diego University) on exchange\nfor a year, so we had a floor to crash on. An added\nplus was that his place was on the beachfront. We\nonly intended to stay overnight but, once introduced\nto the wonders of midnight surfing in the swells of\nthe Pacific, we had such a great time that we stayed\nfour nights. The beach was great during the day as\nwell.\nRestaurants and bars in the area were great,\nthough we did have trouble ordering food at the Taco\nBell. It helps to speak Spanish here since many workers come from across the border as cheap labour.\nBeing on the border with Mexico, we couldn't avoid\nexploring the neighbouring town of Tijuana. We\ndecided to enter on foot, as opposed to flying in.\nWith rumours of corrupt customs officers planting\ndrugs on innocent teenage pilots ringing in my head,\nit took, oh, all of two seconds to come to a decision\non how to cross the border.\nAs border towns go, Tijuana is not attractive at\nall. It's full of gaudy souvenir shops, noisy bars and\nsleazy backstreet s. Visiting was a massive eye-opener.\nThis was mainly because of the shocking contrast\nbetween the two sides of the border. Tijuana mainly\nattracts young Americans, who can legally get drunk\nDemocracy: Under construction.\nmissing anything. We mainly stayed on Avenida Revolucion, the main street, which we were assured was\nsafe. Despite these assurances, we found this street\nto be a raucous strip of seedy bars and dance clubs,\ntacky souvenir shops, cheap restaurants and street\nphotographers with big burros. After dining in one of said restaurants, we noted that Tijuana didn't have a stray cat problem. Indeed, we didn't see any\nstray dogs either. That burrito did taste a bit odd.\nWalking along' Revolucion', you will get accosted\nby every street seller with a nickel-and-dime business.\n'Wanna buy a real Rolex, Gringo? You want women?\nWe have best women. You wan' ma sister? She really\ngood.' And so on. Resisting all these temptations, we\nheaded back over the border. I walked straight across.\nRuss got searched.\nSanta Catallna Island\nNot having the benefit of a car, we decided to bypass\nthe smoggy urban sprawl of the city that is Los Angeles. Instead we chose to visit a place that you can't how do you build an airport on a hilly island? Simple\n- blow the tops off two mountains and use the rubble to fill in the gaps. This is essentially what the\nsuper-rich Wrigley did in the 1930s, creating the 'Air-port in the Sky', 2600 feet above sea level. The runway is not particularly long, so it is mainly used by\nlight aircraft and the occasional DC3 doing short-field\noperations.\nWild buffalo roam the island. They don't have\nbeef burgers at the airport restaurant - they have half-pound buffalo burgers. Mmm mm, delicious. Avalon\nis the only town on Santa Catalina. It's dominated by\nthe White Casino and the Wrigley Mansion, now a hotel. We found Catalina to be very expensive and\nthe preserve of yuppie tourists, so we didn't stay long\nUnfortunately, we didn't experience any of the incredible water sports such as diving. Maybe another\ntime.\nSanta Catalina's \"Airport In the Sky\".\nreach in a car. This is Santa Catalina Island, 35 miles\noff the Californian coast. Formally owned by William\nWrigley Jr. the chewing gum heir, it remains largely\nuntouched and is a conservation area.\nThe island can best be described as hilly. So\nSunset over Avalon Harbour\nLos Angeles\nWe had heard nothing but bad things about LA So\nwe gave it a miss. We over flew it just to add to the\npollution in the area.\nPalo Alto\nFamous for being the University town in which Stanford is located and the centre of Silicon Valley, we\nheaded for Palo Alto. This time, we stayed with one\nof Russ' friends, who was generous enough to lend\nus her VW convertible for the four days we were\nthere.\nThe affluence of Palo Alto is plain to see. Palo\nAlto, home to Netscape, has the highest GDP per\nsquare mile of anywhere in America. Main Street\nresembles Knightsbridge and most of the people I observed in bars and restaurants had the characteristic pretentiousness of 'Sloanies'. However, it is an\nextremely pleasant and beautiful part of the world.\nIf it wasn't located directly at the junction of three\ngeological fault lines, maybe it would be a place I'd consider living.\nSan Francisco\nWe didn't fly into San Francisco. At the time of making this journey, I wasn't instrument rated. San Fran's weather is none too hospitable for pilots: the bay is\noften foggy. Local weather patterns are also highly\nunpredictable. Whilst we could have flown in, there\nwas no saying when we could have flown out. It\nwould be safer to make the one-hour drive from Palo\nAlto.\nSan Francisco: A lot prettier In real-life\nThis is, in my opinion, one of the USA's most\nattractive cities. The often-dramatic cityscape came\nabout because the streets were laid out as if their\nplanners had never so much as glanced at the city's topography. They simply dropped a grid pattern onto\nthe steeply undulating terrain, and the result is that\nstreets often climb or drop at ridiculously steep gra-di ents. Perhaps the greatest benefit this gives rise to\nare the gorgeous glimpses of the San Francisco Bay\nand its famous bridges and of course, car chase\nscenes in movies. As hard as we tried to get the VW\nGolf to take off, we couldn't reproduce the jumps\nfrom Starsky and Hutch. We needed a white go-faster stripe for that.\nThe most densely packed pocket of the city (and\none of its most colourful areas) is Chinatown. It's a great place for casual wandering through narrow\nalleys where you'll find 'hole-in-the-wall' Chinese\nrestaurants. We went to one where the menu was\nonly in Chinese, and took our chance by pointing at\nsome random dish. It was a wonderful meal, with the\nadded bonus of costing less than a Sherfield Sandwich.\nOne can't help but notice the gay community in\nSan Francisco. Rainbow banners and lavender triangles in shop windows indicate they are 'gay-friendly'.\nBy a rough estimation of the San Fran population\nobserved on the streets, any shop that doesn't carry\na rainbow in the window would probably go out of\nbusiness through lack of custom.\nI can't mention San Francisco without at least a passing reference to the Golden Gate Bridge. This\nThe Golden Gate Bridge. Big.\nspans the two mile mouth of the bay. If, like us, you\nget stuck in a rush-hour traffic jam, then you'll get a great view of Alcatraz Island from there. Unfortunately we didn't make it to this 'escape-proof prison\nowing to massive tourist queues for the boat. Next\ntime, we will have to get there earlier.\nNext Week:\nOshkosh, the World's greatest\nair show, Chicago, Toronto,\nNiagara Falls & Ottawa.\n{0 pimlico connection\nm td or tutoring dinner\neat as MUCH as you like\nfor \u00a316.50\nsa\u00ab additional subsidy wU be provided*\nThursday17 June If ff at the Car very.

CCTV\nimages have allowed security to pinpoint exactly when the man entered\nthe building. Meanwhile the police\nhave revealed that they recovered further stolen possessions from the man's person.\nIt is now known that the man\nentered the building at 6.10pm, and\nnot before 6pm as was speculated in\nlast week's issue. He gained access by\nfollowing someone through the doors,\nas swipe cards are needed to enter the\nbuilding after 6pm.

It is now known that as well as\nthe purse mentioned last week, a watch and perfume was also recovered from the man's person by police\nofficers. Ken Weir has asked any member of the college who lost one or\nboth of these items on Wednesday 2\nJune to contact him on x48904 or\ncso.security@ic.ac.uk, including a brief\ndescription of the item or items. Ken\nWeir also reminded staff and students\nto lock labs and offices when leaving\nthem unattended, as he believes this\nis a major factor in attracting thieves\nto the college.\nMeanwhile it is still unclear what\nthe fate of the Biochemistry thief will\nbe, although Ken Weir understands\nfrom the police that he has already\nappeared in court.\nToday is the last day tickets for the\n1999 ICU Summer Ball are available. It\nis still unclear how many tickets are\nlikely to be sold - by last Wednesday\nnight around 900 had been sold, still\nsignificantly less than the predicted\nnumber. Meanwhile ICSM Summer\nBall tickets are currently on sale (see\nletters page). The ICSM ball takes\nplace the day before ICU's ball, and is\nexpected to attract around 900 stu-dents, although as Felix went to press\nit was unclear how many had been\nsold to date. A full report and 'pre-view' of the balls will appear in the last\nFelix of term next week.\nNext Week's Issue\nIssue 1150 Is the final Issue of term and will be published on\nWednesday 23 June, NOT Monday 21 June.\nCraig Perrott, a security guard who has been with the college for fourteen years,\nhas recently become the manager of his football club, Infotel United.

It has come top of Its division and was promoted two divisions\nto the third division. This season It was a finalist In the Intermediate Cup, and only\nlost two games In the league.

    "content": "1\n2 ^7>X^ Film 14 June 1999\nThe Matrix * * * * *\nStarring : Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano\nDirector: Andy & Larry Wachowski\nVery rarely do you see something\nthat will change the way movies\nare made: The Matrix is such a film. Groundbreaking, both visually and\nconceptually, it's light-years ahead of all\ncompetition - and sets the lead which\nevery new action and sci-fi movie made\nin the next few years will undoubtedly\nattempt to follow. Within five minutes its\nvisual style will have you teetering on\nthe edge of your seat, half-an-hour later\nyou'll have gnawed your fingers clean\naway, and by the jaw-disintegrating climax you'll be clinging onto the back of\nthe row in front for dear life. Phantom\nMenace or no Phantom Menace, this is\nthe most imaginative, stylish, entertaining and inventive blockbuster you'll see\nthis year. Period.\nWhat makes The Matrix great is that\nthe m esme rising visuals are combined\nwith mind-blowing character twists and\nplot revelations. I 've no desire to give too\nmuch away, but suffice to say this story\nof displaced reality is like nothing you've\never seen before. At times it undeniably\ncollapses into the realms of in comprehensibility, but by leaving the explanatory\ndialogue in the safe hands of classical\nactor Fishburne, Moss (as the feisty, sexy,\nsidekick-cum-love-interest) and Reeves\n(who's finally found the role he was born\nto play - acting tough and looking con-fused) are left free to play with every last\nnuance of the phenomenal effects.\nWhich isn't to say that this is simply an\neffects-laden, testosterone driven\naction er; far from it. The Wachowski brothers (whose previous CV includes writing\ncredits for the dire Assassins and the arthouse hit Bound) use the effects as a tool\nto create a style, and then use that style\nas the setting for the movie. Thus, the\nstunning visuals aren't just an essential\npart of The Matrix - they're an absolute\nnecessity if the movie is to keep a hold\non you t brain.\nNonetheless, it's the effects which\nhave made The Matrix one of this year's most-talked about movies. State-of-the-art\nproduction facilities (in Australia of all\nplaces) coupled with several months of\nintensive kung-fu training for the leads\nand the absolute latest word in CGI produce images which will burn their way\ninto your brain for weeks after you see\nthe movie. Watch bullets pour past\nReeves, as he sways out of the way in slo-mo whilst the camera pans round him at\nregular speed, and you'll know that every\npenny of the budget was carefully spent.\nAnd there are twenty other stunning set-pieces, each worth the price of admission\non their own. Indeed the only downside\nis that you spend so much time trying to\nwrap your head around the blistering\nimages (accompanied by pounding\nsoundtrack) that making sense of the\nplot is demoted to a distant second place.\nA stunning movie that, once seen,\nwill have to be seen again and again, The\nMatrix provides the shot in the arm that\nboth the sci-fi and action genres have\nbeen crying out for. Sheer, unadulterated brilliance, fl\nDave\nVirus * *\nWilliam Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, Joanna Pacula\nLets be dear about this. Its a virus, NOTThe Terminator, OK?\nStarring : Jamie Lee Curtis,\nDirector: Chuck Pfarrer\nS mall boat in the Pacific comes\nupon a giant floating ship that is\nseemingly deserted...but turns out\nto be inhabited by a vicious monster.\nOriginal plot? Er, I don't think so. Most\ndirectly. Virus is a rip-off of last year's Deep Rising, but more obliquely it borrows from Aliens,, The Day the Earth\nStood Still, Poltergeist, Sphere,\nRobocop, The Terminator, The Thing,\nAlien... Oh, and it's all directed in a sub-Spielbergian style.\nThe opening credits set up the\nschlock sci-fi premise: A drifting space\ncloud enveloped the Mir space station\nand sent a bolt of energy down to the\nsatellite dish of a Russian communications ship, and apparently the energy\nincluded a virus that takes over the\nonboard computers and represents a vast, if never clearly defined, threat to life\non earth. Ooooh. Scary.\nCue the stereotypical characters:\nGruff captain Sutherland wants to claim\nthe ship for salvage, whilst Curtis and\nBaldwin would much rather be somewhere else entirely. Meanwhile, the\nmethods of the Vitus itself are strange. It\ncreates robots, and uses them to grab\ncrew members and turn them into\nstrange creatures that are half-man, half-Radio Shack. Obviously, it's up to Curtis,\nBaldwin and their crew mates to outsmart\nthe virus, which seems none too bright\nand spends most of its time clomping\naround and issuing threatening statements through a \u00a31.99 voice synthesis er. The movie's special effects are not\nexactly slick, and the creature itself is a distinct let-down. It looks like a very tall\nhumanoid fig ute hammered to get he t out of crushed auto parts, with several\nheadlights for its eyes. It crunches\nthrough steel bulkheads and crushes all\nbarriers to its progress, in a way which\nsuggests that the makers were far more\ninterested in copying Robocop and Terminator lhan in modelling a virus.\nLike an increasing number of movies\nin the post X Files age, the last half h out of the movie is almost impossible to\nmake out. In dark dimness, various\nhuman and other figures race around in\na lot of water and flashlight beams, and\nthere is much screaming. Occasionally an\neye, a limb, or a bloody face emerges\nfrom the gloom - but exactly what's going\non is anybody's guess.\nWhat's left is another mundane entry\ninto the current horror revival. With more\nand more sub-standard projects being\nrushed into the multiplexes all the time\n(turnaround times can now be measured\nin terms of a few months), surely it can't be long before the backlash kicks in?Q Dave\n\n"

    "content": "18 Games 14 June 1999\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3 (PSX)\nVirgin Interactive\nHaving set myself up by\nsaying this review would\nbe in last week's Felix I managed to get the viral\ninfection, second cousin\nto influenza and a distant relation to ebola,\nwhich put me on my\nback, on the toilet and\nover the bucket for a week and a half. Let that\nbe a lesson to me, never\npromise an issue. Anyway excuse and virus\nover It's time to kick back\nwith a vengeance, the\ncapcom 2D fighter is\nback... again.\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3,\nbegot of Street fighter 2, begot of Street\nfighter Alpha, begot of... well there is\nmore heritage in this game than in the\nwhole of Chelsea football club. Over\ntime and over several generations of\nconsoles and computers Street Fighter\nhas been the beat-em-up which all others have tried to match, or perhaps to be\nmore accurate the 2D beat-em-up to\nbeat - the 3D and the copycat 2.5D boys\nleft this battlefield behind and moved on\nto the world of floating cameras and\npopulated polygon muscles. Street\nFighter Alpha 3 (oh alright SFA3) at the\narcade is still capcom's little jewel in an\notherwise corroded crown and fortunately, despite running on a less than\narcade powered machine, the Playstation\nversion is impressively good.\nThe graphics are as you would\nexpect of the capcom world, cartoon\nand 2D. But very good cartoon and 2D graphics they are too. The claimed loads\nof frames per second are probably all\nthere - once again they were a little too\nquick to count, but just because they are\nquick doesn't mean that they are not\nsmooth. In fact they are galaxy chocolate\nsmooth, and\nnoticeably so | |\nacross the inc red im bly detailed\n(though flat) back |\ngrounds. With\ngraphics like Ihc s. perhaps the capcom machines should be\nreplaced by a playstation\nin a cabinet, and we might\nhave ten pence arcade\ngames again.\nThe sounds are\narcade quality. Well, as\nmost of the time the original arcade machines\nseem to be placed about\ntwenty centimetres away\nfrom the in pub entertainment system, I have no idea. Though for effect I played\nthis while borrowing my flat mate's hits of\nthe nineties tape on a poor quality\namstrad tape player. Turning the tape off\nto listen to the game, I rapidly realised\nthat perhaps the position of the arcade\nmachine was not an accident. The sound\ndoesn't subtract anything from the game\nbut really doesn't add anything either.\nGameplay wise, err well yes I did\nstart to like it. You might realise that I'm not the biggest fan of beat-em-ups and\neven less so of 2D beat-em-ups, but this\none has all the options of the current\ncrowd. There are the simple one on one\nfights, the team battles, even the ability\nto customise the fighter's ability as you\ngain experience while fighting a series of\nfights. Once again as with most of the\nbeat-em-up world, playing against the\ncomputer is OK, but the best battles are\nagainst other more human opponents-though make sure the competitive streak\ndoesn't boil over to re-enacting the\nthrowing moves in real life.\nSo it is a2D beat-em-up that even I recommend - rare praise indeed. If you\nreally need to beat-up sprites on the\nplaystation and you don't own the earlier games it is definitely worth running\ndown to the shops and buying it. If you\nare less aggressive and more pensive,\nperhaps your local game rental shop can\nhelp you discover your latent violent side\n- though we take no responsibility for\nyour actions after a few drinks.\nCary 5.\nKKND - Krossfire (PSX)\nInfogrames\nGood Graphics:\nNice scorched earth effects\nfor the ground, very command and conquer\npseudo-3D terrain, with the\nusual cliffs, rivers, lakes and\nfords. The actual machines\nOne line Summary:\nPost-nuclear battle field Command and\nConquer Clone.\nWhat's it all about:\nThe war to end all wars has come and\ngone, leaving three distinct races fighting another war - the war after the war\nto end all wars except perhaps this final\nwar. So you have the survivors, a bunch\nof military minded bunker based\nhumanoids, a bunch of mutated human\nanimal hybrids, and some artificially intelligent metal monsters, all fighting for oil\nand the blistered and blasted surface.\ndrop screaming bombs on their targets.\nNothing really special anywhere though.\nGreat Gameplay:\nWell it is Command and Conquer, f he basic game is to collect oil to power the\npower stations which then allow you to\nbuild more\ntanks, infantry,\naircraft and\nboats. While you\ndo this you\ndefend your\nbase with turrets\nand research the\nvarious buildings\nto get bigger\nquer scene you will like it.\nBest bit:\nIt's almost as good as Red Alert... almost.\nWorst Bit:\nIt's almost as good as Red Alert... almost...\nthe machines are too small and without\na mouse it can be a real pain to move\nfrom one side of the map to the other.\nSo who will get it :\nRed Alert fans.... err that's about it really.\nIf you want a Red Alert game buy Red\nAlert.\nincredibly\ndetailed, but at least they are smooth\nmoving. The explosions arc a little wimpy,\nno blood or metal fragments, just a puff\nof black smoke.\nSeraphim Sounds:\nSoundtrack alters according to which\nside you play, though it's nothing special\nfor any of them - very sub C&C and Red\nAlert. Various units make different bang\nand splatting noises, even the aircraft\nand better tanks,\ninfantry and other\nbits. While not every\nlevel follows this path\n- some get you to\nspring traps and\nambush enemy\ntroops - it is a case of\nif you really like the\nCommand and Con-\n"

Kevin was present when filming\nfor the Channel Four science documentary Equinox was carried out in Physics\nLecture Theatre one last week. Bizarrely\nthe film crew spent at least as much\ntime filming students' feet walking up\nand down the lecture theatre's steps as\nthey did filming the esteemed Imperial\nCollege academic. Whilst being filmed\nthe academic stood at the front 'lect ur ing' random garbled sentences. I assume\nthis piece of film will have a voice-over\nby the time it is screened. Those of you\nwith good lip reading skills may pick up\nsome interesting gardening tips.\nTechnology Out of Control?\nThe swipe card controlled door at the\nmain entrance to Computing has been\nmisbehaving recently, occasionally resulting In small groups of computing students being observed outside the door,\nwaiting for someone who has a swipe\nthat works in the door to come by and\nlet them in. Kevin finds it incredible Imperial College of Science, Technology and\nMedicine never\nseems to have the\ntechnology especially\nwhen It comes to the\nseemingly simple\nthings like doors and\nlights.\nLibrary PA\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin has learnt that Kevin, a random entity who\nduring the summer a knows nothing about nothing\nnew Public Address \u2022\nsystem is going to be installed in the Central Library. Unfortunately it is not going\nto be used to broadcast the Library Attendant's news announcements. Many\nlibrary users have supported the\nannouncements, although a few complained at the disruption to study they\ncaused. The library un surprisingly responded with, \"Those who wish to\nhave quiet in the Library must prevail\".\nThe new PA system will come into its own\nat closing time, when it will replace the\nhand bell. Let's hope that lessons will be\nlearnt from the results of connecting the\nBMS PA to a tyrannical computer and the\nlibrary system will not be attached to a computer. Kevin has\nnightmarish visions of\nan ever-increasing\nfrequency of computerised 'signals', cum u latin g with\n\"beep...beep...beep...\non my next beep you\nwill leave the\nlibrary...\". While we're\non this point, how\nmuch time does it\ntake to you pick up\nyour books and walk\nout of the library? Hopefully the PA system will allow warnings to start perhaps\nthree minutes before closing rather than\nthe present thirty.\nFire Engine Sororities\nKevin watched a documentary on sororities, Masonic style, social groups based\nin American universities. One group featured even possessed their own fire\nengine, which although a rather cool\nidea, reminds me of a group here at IC.\nI imagine these sororities to also serve no\nreal purpose and to be run by the same\nsmall band of self-important individuals,\nyear after year.\nThe Joy of Caffeine\nWhilst walking around the South Kensington area ridiculously early on Sunday\nmorning, Kevin was amazed by the\namount of street wildlife. A huge number of pigeons and squirrels were making good use of unfinished burgers and\nalike. Something else that surprised Kevin\nwas the huge number of coffee shops in\nthe area. Kevin suspects that he is not the\nfirst person to notice this, especially given\nthe degree to which caffeine culture has\npervaded the college; he has also\nnoticed the 'Caffeine Appreciation Society' listed as an official ICU society. This\nis the first reference to the society that\nKevin has seen. Perhaps someone could\ntell me how I can get in touch.\nSend ideas and contributions to\nkevin_ mishmash@ hotmail.com\nPresidential Talk-Back\nThis week written by an alternative senior Union source.\nOh dear, it appears that the Union\nPresident has failed to meet the copy\ndeadline for today. As I type he lies in\nbed bemoaning his social skills (on\nwhich I will shortly expand) whilst nursing a large hangover.\nLast Wednesday night the\nesteemed Mr Hellard ventured into\nthe wilds of East London to mix with\nthe Wideboys of Queen Mary & Westfield. Now, this may seem like this was\na rash idea but he did have an ultimate\ngoal. Steps...\nYou see, the QMW Summer Ball\nhad the masters of Brlt-SyncDance as\ntheir main attraction. As the event cost\n\u00a345 and there was no meal then an\nattraction such as this was essential to\npull the crowds in.\n\"Did young David \"pull\" a step?\" I hear you ask. At this moment it cannot\nbe confirmed; however, let's just think\nabout it.\nThe following information was\nobtained from the \"Planet Steps\" web-site. It is full of so much information\nthat it overwhelmed me. If you want\ninstructions (Including videos) of how\nto dance like Steps then this is the\nplace for you!\n1. H: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:\nFab & cool\n2. Lisa: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:\nMinger (horrible)\n3. Lee: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:\nOh hello & cool\n4. Claire: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:\nFantastic, really\n5. Faye: WORDS YOU KEEP USING:\nLush\nClaire and Dave - the perfect couple?\nIt is quite obvious therefore that an\nimmediate attraction would occur with\nClaire due to their mutual overuse of\nthe word fantastic. She's also a big fan\nof Celine Dion and Leonardo Di Caprio\nso they have even more in common\nthan a first glance would indicate.\nHere is their first conversation:\nDave Hellard: Wow you were fan-ta stic. Claire Richards: Thanks, that's fan-ta stic. DH: Did you know I'm the President of Imperial College Union? We\nhave the largest student venue in London.\nCR: Really?\nDH: Yes, and our baguette bar is\nfantastic plus I'm setting up a job shop. CR: Wow! Fantastic\nDH: I know! Fantastic, isn't it?\nCR: Fantastic!!\nDH: Do you want to come to our\nsummer ball with me - it's going to be\nfantastic!\nCR: No. Bye.\nSo in conclusion, of course he did-n't don't be bloody ridiculous.

I perused the selection and\nfound the normal mixture of mostly\ncrappy magazines (Hello, fond on Magazine, Antiques Today, What Car etc.).\nI could not help but notice that at least\n9 9 % of them were more than 6\nmonths out of date. The oldest I found\nwas Which Car 1987!

With a different set of priorities,\nputting the emphasis on people, not\nprofit, business practices can be changed\nand we can all spend more time in the\npub.\ncheers,\nmarc\nMish-Mash and Medics\nI think that some people are \"so self-important and take things so seriously\nthat It's Just funny to take the piss out\nof them\" It Just seems unfortunate\nthat ICSM has become the paradigm\nfor stereotypes that can be found In\nmost.

Reclaim The Streets\nare going to be throwing a party in the\nSquare Mile and there should be something happening at Trafalgar Square\naround 5.\nThe reason why people are protesting is the belief that the global capitalist\nsystem is at the root of our social and\necological troubles. By protesting (or riot-ing, partying etc) people hope to change\nthe perception that these problems can\nbe solved only by more growth and free\ntrade. For more details on\nI feel I must defend Kevin from the veritable onslaught he received in the letters page last week.\nI have to agree that the column\ndoes sometimes focus too much on\nMedics but to be honest I think that\nsome 'wannabe doctors' are so self-important and take things so seriously\nthat it's just funny to take the piss out\nof them.\nTake the anonymous first year\nmedic who wrote last week.

    "content": "20 Sport 14 June 1999\nCRICKET\nD 'oh! Bart's knock IC out of cup\nICs rearranged semi-final away to St.\nBart's last Sunday resulted in the club's first loss in almost three years and failure in their attempt to capture their\nthird successive ULU cup. Team selection and organisational problems, which\npartly resulted from the match being\nrearranged, contributed to defeat, as\ndid the weather conditions.\nThe draw seemed odd, given that IC\nhad already defeated Bart's in a bad\ntempered group match at Harlington,\nand so should really not have played\nthem again until the final, and should\ncertainly not have been forced to play\naway from home. But as the draw for\nthe knockout stages had been set\nbefore the competition began, this was\npredictably going to happen. The problem would not have been so noticeable\nif Holloway had defeated Bart's in the\nquarter finals but they were unable to\ndo so.\nIn the match Itself, after arriving\nlate thus reducing the match to 30 overs\na side, IC lost the toss and were put into\nbat on a fairly green and damp wicket.\nIn cloudy and sometimes showery\nweather, IC struggled to 94 all out off 30\novers, Khurrum top scoring with 24, with\nnext highest scorer being extras on 20.\nPredictably after the interval, the clouds\ncleared and Bart's batted their entire\ninnings in bright sunlight. They reached\n60 off 20 overs but then lost their best\nplayer, Britton (the UH captain) and had\nsomewhat of a collapse In the face of\nsome hostile bowling from the entire IC\nattack, and eventually won by just 3\nwickets with one over to spare and\nsome very nervous players on the ?\nboundary.\nDespite the selection problems IC .\nwere only 3 or 4 players short of fielding their best side, and definitely looked\nbetter on paper against Bart's, especially in bowling. The good news for the ,\nclub is that almost all the players that |\nmake Imperial one of the strongest college cricket sides in the capt al, will be' back again next year, when IC try to win\nthe cup for the third time in four years.\nRight. I 've got almost a page to fill,\nabsolutely no sport at all and short of\nwriting about the cricket world cup\nevery week, I am up sh*t creek at the\nmoment. So I have decided to do\nsomething radical. Introduce you all\nto baseball. Before you turn the page\nor look away in disgust, let me try and\npersuade you it is not a hyped up\ngame of rounders, but an in depth\nchallenge of skill and strategy.\nFor those of you still here, let me\nease you in gently. Baseball is played\nmainly in the US but also a lot in Central America and the Hispanic parts of\nthe Caribbean (like Cuba). In the US,\nthe professional season runs from April till September, and teams play\nalmost every day (162 games in a sea-son). Baseball is a game made up of\ntwo teams of 9 players, a diamond\nshaped infield with 4 bases at each\ncorner and a raised mound in the c en tre. There are 8 position players l field ers) and one pitcher, who throws the\nball, while standing on the mound. The opposing team then sends up, in\na set order, one player at a time who\nhas to try and hit the ball and score\nruns. Runs are scored by running all\nthe way around the diamond shaped\ninfield (although not necessarily in\none go). The pitcher has to throw the\nball over home plate, somewhere between the batters knees and his\nelbows. If the pitch is in this box or\nzone, the pitch is a strike. If not It Is\na( no)ball. Three strikes and the batter is out - four balls and the batter\ngets to first base for free. Batters can\nalso be out if they hit the ball and it is\ncaught, or they are run out by the ball\ngetting to a base before they do.\nThree outs and the whole team is out\nand they switch round - the team that\nwas batting fields and the fielding\nteam bats. This goes on for 9 innings\neach, or until one team is ahead of the\nother - whichever is the later.\nThat's the basics. Now lets go\ninto some depth. I 'll try and make\ncomparisons with cricket because\nthat's what most people are familiar\nwith. As you can imagine, the 8 field-ers, who all have a large glove or mit\non their non throwing hand, are\nspread around the playing field. The\ncatcher (wicket-keeper KC all positions have letters for short) squats\nbehind home plate and catches the\npitches (as you will see the names of\nthe positions aren't very original). He\nalso tells the pitcher(P) what pitch to\nthrow by the use of signals with his fingers - e.g.1 for a fast-ball(85-95mph),2 for an off speed( slower) pitch, 3 for\na curve ball( ball moves across and\ndown the strike zone due to rotation\nof the seam). There are three base-men, at 1st based B),2nd(2 B) base\nand, you guessed it, 3rd(3 B) base.\nThere are three outfielders in left(LF),\nright(RF) and centre field(CF) (they are\nnamed as if you are looking from\nbehind the plate). And there is a short-stop(SS) who fields between 2nd and 3rd base. Despite the name 2nd base spends most of his time between\n1st and 2nd, and SS and 2B share the\nduties of actually manning 2nd base\nitself. There are 16 substitutes, 10 of\nwhich are usually pitchers. Uniquely\nin American sport, baseball is the only\ngame in which you are not allowed\nunlimited substitutions - once a player\nis out of the game, they are out of the\ngame. Teams usually have a \"rotation\"\nof 5 starting pitchers who pitch once every five days each and are expected\nto pitch 7 or 8 innings - about 100/110\npitches, which is quite tough on the\narm and the shoulder. The rest of\nthe pitchers are relief pitchers who\nmake up all the innings the starters\ncan't not more than about 2 or 3\ninnings each at most.\nThe hitter looks to have an easier\njob. All he has to do is hit the ball, but\nit is harder than that. If you have ever\ntried to play rounders (the one and\nonly comparison I will allow), you will\nknow it is tough to hit the ball. Now j imagine the ball being thrown at\n90mph+ and all manner of fielders I, waiting to catch the ball or run you E out. You see why even the best hit-jj\nter s only get hits 3 0 % of the time. A| hit is when the hitter hits the ball and! gets to first base without the ball l being caught or the ball getting to j the base before him. If he hits it well 1\nenough to get to 2nd in one go, it is fa double. If he reaches third in one go I it is a triple. If he hits it out of the| park, he get all the way around in one! go and scores a run - this is a home-J run. Hitters are not allowed to hit the| ball behind them - it counts as a strike j if they do. They score runs if they!\ncross home plate it does not matter\nif they stop at every base on the way g around.\nTypical scores in a game are 6-4 oi j f75. If this sounds interesting, live j baseball games can be found on j Channel 5 on Sundays and Wednesday's from about midnight (after the\ndod gy porn films). Take a look - you\nmight be surprised! I might consider\nadding more to this guide at a later\ndate - stay tuned.\nWe had many many correct answers to last week's crossword - well done to all of you who entered.\nThere can, however, be only one winner, and that Is\nDavid Norman (NHLI)\nPlease contact us (x58072) to arrange your prize.\nNo Crossword this week...\nMany apologies for the lack of a crossword this week.

Derivative, childish\nand formulaic Rush Hour may be, but\nit's never less than entertaining -despite an over concentration on Tucker's eye-rolling and gur ning, and a consequent lack of classic Jackie Chan\naction.\nHilary & Jackie\nOne of the best British movies prod u ced so far this year, Hilary & Jackie\nhas already garnered its fair share of\nawards - and deservedly so, particularly\nin the case of Oscar-nominated stars\nEmily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. The\nreal-life story of legendary cellist\nJacqueline Du Pre and her long-suffer-ing sister Hilary, it's touching, funny\nand incredibly moving, largely thanks\nto a soundtrack which highlights\nJackie's amazing talent. Historically\naccurate it may not be, but the emotional, tear-jerking ending makes up for\nall that.\nWhat Dreams\nMay Come\nRobin Williams career is the true definition of hit-and-miss. For every great\nrole (Good Will Hunting, Good Morning\nVietnam, Aladdin) there's a complete\ndog( Flubber, Jack, Popeye). What\nDreams may Come falls on one of his\nup-slopes - however, the movie itself\nstill succeeds in being pretty awful.\nCloyingly sentimental, director Vincent\nWard uses every computer effects technique available to create a limitless\nvision of the after-life. However, when the only thing going for a movie is its\neffects (What Dreams is incredibly light\non plot), there's not going to be much left by the time it hits the small screen.\nBest avoided.\nDave\n\n"

Issue\n1149\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Southside Blocks Locks\nOn Thursday 3 June, the Pro-rector,\nProfessor Tim Clark, came to speak to\nSouthside residents about the situation\nof the blocks being put on south-fac-ing windows. This was in response to\na180 strong petition from the res i dents, being handed in to the Rector.\nMany residents were keen to put a face to the people behind the inconvenient obstruction and the turnout\nai the meeting was good. The Pro-rector began his address by stating that the blocks had been put\nin as a response to the shocking incident (reported earlier this year in Felix)\nwhere a resident's guests had th r own bottles and peanut butter out of a win-dow, nearly missing a passer-by and damaging an antique Ferrari. The situation not only cause Imperial College money in the covering the costs of all\ni he repairs but had also damaged the\ne put atl on and affected the process and acceptance of many building applications. There had been no other\nBy Abigail Lazzerlne\nalternative, he concluded, but to implement the blocks to reduce the ability\nof opening the windows on southside.\nThe Head of Estates, who was also\npresent informed residents of the\nrecent failed attempt to build another\nhall of residence on the tennis courts,\nwith a gym underneath. This was rejected by the council with the help\nof approximately 100 letters of com plaint from the local residents, who as\nwell as rejecting to the traffic it would cause, believed students were' uncontrollable vandals' and boisterous in\ntheir behaviour. The total lost to the\ncollege had been estimated to be around a quarter of a million pounds as a result of the investigation of the\nfailed planning permission.\nResidents put forward the ideas\nthat reflective film, fly-nets and netting\ncould be used as alternatives to the\nblocks already present, but care must\nbe taken with these methods since\nSouthside is a listed building. A suggestion even came of a garden fe te being held as a PR exercise to show the convinced local residents that not\neveryone in Southside was a vandal\nand instinctive towards throwing bottles out of windows. One resident\nwas concerned that expulsion should\nlead for a student, after such an incident but the Pro-rector and Dr Hassard.\nTizard and Selkirk warden, said there\nhad been 'extenuating circumstances'\nthis time but the guests from other colleges were currently being prosecuted.\nSuggestions were also made that\nSouthside security should be strength-ene danda signing-in system installed,\nas present at King's and Cambridge University but the Pro-rector reported\nthat in his past post as a warden, this\nsystem was not effective.\nIt was also revealed that only a quarter of the incidents, where items\nhad been thrown from Southside, had\ncome from resident's windows, yet the\nwindows were still blocked.\nIt has been stated by Estates and\nthe Pro-rector that any measure will be\ntemporary since the whole building is\nto be refurbished in a year's time. The conclusion from the meeting, how-ever, was that the temporary measure\nof blocks on the windows is not satisfactory and has proven to be very\ninconvenient for students revising in\nthe hot weather in poorly ventilated\nrooms. The residents asked for a swift\nconclusion to the situation and called\nfor the removal of the blocks. The\nmeeting concluded with the understanding that the Pro-rector would take\nan appropriate course of action after\ndeliberating the situation with his col-leagues.\nSports Centre Swallows Southside\nHans for the future of Southside Gym lave sparked off sparked off strongly\n*or ded argument between College Sports Management and the Union. The proposal to hand the Gym over\nlo Sports Centre management whilst\nthe Sports Centre building works take\nPlace ( due to start In approximately to el ve months time) has faced a hos-!ie reception from Deputy President\n,Clubs & Societies) Marie Ni chola ou, \u00bbho fears that students and societies\n|ll loose out as a result. At present, the\n;fy m is booked out through the Union, Jrtmarlly for Martial Arts and Aerobics\ntosses. If the Sports Centre take-over\nManagement responsibility then, 'according to Sports & Leisure Manager 'tank Murray, \"the facility will be available to Clubs on the same basis as\nhose In the existing Sports Centre\". However, this is likely to mean that the\nCollege Fitness Club will take most pri-for it y bookings, particularly during I'u nch tl mes, as Mr Murray believes that\nBy David Roberts\nPhoto: Ed\nthe College group is ' open to all\",\nrather than Just to a specific member ship list.

The other point of contention is\nthe role of the Gym after the new Sports Centre - complete with massive\nsports hall - is constructed. According to\nMr Murray, under the agreement which\nled to the College decision to develop the Sports Centre both the Southside\ngym and the weights room will revert\nto College use as part of the Soulhside\ndevelopment when the new Sports\nCentre opens. Most importantly. \" Nei ther will be available for sports use,\neither by ICU or the Sports & Leisure\nSection\".\nAlthough plans for the Southside\ncomplex have been long known, confirmation that the Gym will no longer be\navailable for sports activity puts a lot of pressure on both College and the\nUnion to ensure that proposals for running the new Centre don't lead to any\nloss of club facilities.\nColOUrS - ICU Colours\nCompetition\nLetters - and Small Ads\nEditorial - Portman Travel\nColumns - Portman Travel\nFeature - ri y mg USA n2 Film - The Matrix\nFilm Competition\nClub scene Sasha\nGames wipeout\n\\SpOLt - Not much, really\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n\n"

    "content": "8 Columns 14 June 1999\nWe columnists are, with no exceptions, a pilloried breed, placed\nby many in the social pecking\norder between pae d ophile s and Michael\nWinner. Consequently, we must stick\ntogether in times of trouble. To this end,\nI note that the new lad on the team,\nKevin, seems to be getting some stick\nfrom the medical fraternity. It would\nappear that the sensitive denizens of the\nBMS objected to reports of yet another\ncock up in the ivory tower. Leaving aside\nthe observation that building malfunctions in the BMS are so frequent that they\nrender 'Dog Bites Man' worthy of a lead\non the Today Programme by comparison,\nthe suggestions that medics are arrogant\nneeds addressing. For a start, they are not\nall arrogant, but they all should be. Has\nanyone ever visited a GP that is not arrogant, condescending and in possession of\na belief that doctors are God's chosen\nfew, vastly superior to the p roles that pollute their surgeries? You cannot, therefore,\ncriticise medical students for displaying\nsimilar traits because it is all a part of the\ntraining. As for the attitude of the lect ur ers, I am puzzled. From my limited experience of the pharmacology boys at St\nMary's,I would say that they are a much\nmore pleasant bunch than the young-ster s. A case of he who can sneer does,\nhe who can't teaches?\nTravel, as every citizen of the global\nvillage knows, broadens the mind. Arriving in a far flung kingdom often raises a series of questions as one inevitably seeks\nto know what is going on. However, the\narrival of Portman Travel on campus has\nmade me ask even more questions than\na lengthy cultural voyage of discovery in\nMagaluf. For those of you that don't know\n- and this hasn't exactly been shouted\nfrom the rooftops - they have replaced STA\nas the provider of non-student travel ser-vices. So why does this affect you? Well,\nmany of you reading this are not stu-dents, and the rest of you are affected\nindirectly due to the money that the Union\nearns from such matters. The way this\nwhole thing has transpired is odd, even\nby College standards, so if you're sitting\ncomfortably, then I shall begin. The first\nobvious question is why College sought\nto change company. STA has a good rep-ut ation, and most academics seemed\npretty happy with the level of service. Our\nfriends In Sherfield\nobviously thought differently and put the\nthing out to tender.\nNo problem there; if\nSTA offered the best\ndeal, both in terms of\nrevenue generated\nfor Imperial and level\nof service, then they\nwould get it, or would\nbe replaced by a better outfit. So it came\nto pass, as is the way here, that a committee was convened to evaluate the\nbids. Those bidding would then give their\npresentations, detailing the size of their\noffers, level and scope of service etc. This\nis where it gets confusing. The committee\nwere not given any financial details of the\nbids, Instructed only to concentrate on the\n'quality of service.' Additionally, the composition of the committee was surprising.\nWith the greatest respect to those con-cern ed, this was not the usual mix of big\nhitters. No Pro-Rectors, no Sherfield Directors, which, in a College where paperclip\nrequisitions go before the full Governing\nBody, seems very odd.\nThe cogs whirred and the decision\nwas made, giving Portman the contract.\nWhispers on the breeze along the walk-has gone into this very thoroughly. So\nwhere does the Union fit in? In bygone\ndays when life was simpler, ICU received\nthe rent from both STA shops, a useful\nsource of revenue. That all changed last\nyear when Sherfield\ndecided that the Union\nshould pay for the refurbishment of a facility it\ndid not own or control,\nthe JCR. While our\nfriends in Estates made a superb job, it cost the\nUnion, and hence us,\n70% of this rental income. This is clearly\nnot good news for an organisation that\nhas seen its trading income slashed over\n\"my first, toe-dipped-in-the-water opinion\nis that this looks\nextremely dubious...\"\nSimon Baker\nVoice of Reason\n\"...the arrival of Portman Travel on campus has made me ask\neven more questions\nthan usual...\"\nway slowly revealed a bit more about the\narrangement. How much rent would they\npay? Er, none. Well, they must at least be\npaying for phones,\nelectricity, start-up\nrefurbishment costs.\nNow this seems very\nodd. Has Imperial\nstarted to take its charitable status a bit far?\nOf course not. They\nhave come up with a fantastic wheeze\nwhereby the College\nreceives all Portman's travel commissions.\nHow this has been defined is not\nabsolutely clear, but I'm sure someone\nrecent years, beginning with the Waterstone's victory. So, I hear you cry, let's talk\nturkey. How much will they now get?\nWell, my friends, you are not the only ones\nasking. Nobody knows, which must be\ncausing the Union a few headaches in the\nbudgeting department. Still, if we leave\naside all this financial malarkey, we are left\nwith the issue of customer service, which\nmust obviously be higher than STA, given\nthat this was the key criterion. Ah, not so\nsure about that. I have heard many people complain that Portman are not performing at quite the level their success in\nthe tender would suggest; bookings have\nbeen incorrectly made, the suggestion\nbeing that the staff may not allegedly be\nquite as good as STA. Allegedly.\nMy first, toe-dipped-in-the-water opinion is that this looks extremely dubious.\nCollege has behaved in a totally inexplicable manner in respect of this. To have a committee charged\nwith evaluating tender bids without\naccess to any financial information\nlooks extremely sus-pec t. How on earth\ncan one judge how\nrealistic levels of service are without seeing some figures?\nTaken together with the unusual composition of the committee, you cannot help\nbut conclude that this was a fait ac com pli, and if so, why? Since I have always\nbelieved that Sherfield's weirder machinations are always cock up rather than\nconspiracy, I shall not speculate as to\nwhether the best bid won. However, the\ncontract must have had Portman in\nstitches. I cannot think of any other landlord that would draw up a similar arrange-ment, under which the College takes all\nthe downside risk; if Portman don't make\na profit, Imperial will not get a penny. Of\ncourse, a company with such generous\nterms is unlikely to lose money. Or could\nthey? A number of academics are not\nhappy with Portman. But it does not stop\nthere. STA have been told that they must\nnot accept orders from academics under\nany circumstances, as this would be\ndeemed breach of contract, for which\nthey would be penal is ed. In effect, staff\nat IC may use any travel agent in the\nworld, stick it on their credit card and\nclaim the money back later, except a shop\non campus. Whether this is legal is any-body's guess, but there is strong possibility\nthat people will use other companies out\nof sheer bloody-mindedness. Should that\nhappen, I smell egg on face. At a time\nwhen Imperial is, not unreasonably, seeking to maximise revenue from its commercial activities, this whole saga looks\nvery, very strange, if not outrageous. I haven't finished with this...\nFinally, I must return to the subject of\nthe College's tie clubs. Though they do\nnot seek publicity, despite the perpetual\ncarping directed at them, I feel I must\nmention the RSM's Chaps Club. A venerable organisation, established in the Twenties, its members, not to be confused\nwith the C&G's Links Club, are fine ambassadors for Imperial. This could not be illustrated more clearly than at last week's Derby. The good name of the RSM and IC in general was worn on their sleeves and\nsung from their hearts, moving one young\nlady to remove her upper garments on at least four occasions. Clearly moved by the spectacle, she cryptically added, 'just\nbecause I 've shown you my tits, it does-n't mean I'm that sort of girl.' Ladies and\ngentlemen, I give you the Chaps Club.\nScholars and gentlemen.\n\n"

    "content": "14 June 1999\nEditorial 7\nPortman Travel\nSomething is definitely not quite right.\nFelix knew about the Portman Travel deal\nsome time ago but, as is often the case,\nthere was plenty of speculation and very\nfew facts. Simon Baker (see Voice of Reason this week) seems to have hit the nail\non the head, though, and unearthed\nsome details which don't exactly add up.\nI have watched far too many\nepisodes of the X Files to possibly believe\nthat cock up is more likely than conspiracy.\nIf I am wrong, however, than may I suggest that someone in Sherfield who does\nknow what's going on writes a nice letter\nsetting Felix straight on the matter. Either\nway, we hope to bring you more on this\nnext week so watch, or rather read, this\nspace (well, actually the news pages, but\nyou get the idea...)\nSocialist Workers?\nOn Saturday 5 June there was an anti-NATO protest in London well attended by,\namong others, the Socialist Worker posse\nthat always seems to crop up at these kind\nof demonstrations. Now those of you\nwho, disregarding all danger to your\nhealth, have read this space all year will\nprobably have guessed that capitalism\nisn't exactly my favourite ideology. While\nnot embracing communism on a practical level, Iam not adverse to having it\nround for a slap up meal and a glass of\nproletariat Merlot occasionally.\nSocialist Worker, however, is not my\npreferred reading matter. What irritates\nme most about it is that it is simply propaganda disguised as a newspaper. Let\nme explain. One of the most important\ncodes of conducts for journalists and editors is the importance of separating fact,\nconjecture and comment. Hence most\nnewspapers have news pages for facts,\nwhich may include quoted comments,\nand columns pages for more comment\nand conjecture. Socialist Worker, how-ever, differentiates between these even\nless than Felix does (wait, is that a spike\nof self-criticism I hear?). Fact and conjecture are often interwoven into the same\narticle, even the same sentence. Their\nfacts are generally accurate, their comments are often interesting, but trying to\nseparate the two can sometimes be\nharder than pulling a Sun photographer\noff the window of a celebrity sauna\nhouse.\nOne of their anti-war arguments\npointed to the hypocrisy of NATO in\nbombing Serbia while turning a blind eye\nto one of its own member states (Turkey)\ncarrying out serious human rights violations unchecked for years. Now I agree\nthat NATO's motives may be less than\nsaintly, but criticising someone for not taking action in one situation is hardly an\nargument for them not to take action in\nanother. Hang on, didn'tI say I wasn't going to talk about this?\nSenior Common Room\nAway from the ethics of capitalism and\nconflict, the finances of the Senior Common Room revival, and the tension it\ncould cause with the Union, are setting\noff alarm bells all around Beit Quad. Hang\non, this is capitalism and conflict... oh,\nnever mind.\nOK, so I don't have any actual facts.\nMaybe our friends in Estates are going to\ndo it all with Do It All, coming in one\nweekend armed with DIY equipment, and\nget a new SCR built for the price of a Black&Decker drill. Maybe the rumours of\nnew trading outlets along the walkway,\nincluding on the newsagent's site, are\nuntrue. Maybe the Union's tenancy of the\nnewsagent's doesn't come to the end of\nits term next year. Maybe...\nThe loss of the bookshop was bad\nenough for the Union and you, the stu-dents, as it saw the end of a valuable\nsource of Union income. OK, so Waterstone's are a bit bigger, and are even ful-filing their contract now, but at least when\nyou spend money at the ICU Shop you\nknow it is ploughed back into Ents, Bars\nand the like. We failed to stop the bookshop from going - let's not let it happen\nagain.\nFelix - the not quite final move\nIt seems I 've got a bit of space left to fill,\nso I might as well tell you lot what's happening with Felix at the end of this term\nand next year. The last issue comes out\non Wednesday 23 June. Hoorah. On the\nThursday and Friday of that week the felix Office will be packed up and moved, so\ndrop by before then if you need to pick\nanything up, ask any questions, etc.\nOur new, but temporary, abode will\nbe the port aka bins behind the liquid nitrogen near Physics (head off Prince Consort\nRoad towards Sherfield, and they're on\nyour right). For the record books, I was\nsomewhat forced to agree to this against\nmy better judgement, but I am sure David\nRoberts will cope admirably in the sheds.\nThe following year we will move back to\nBeit and into the new media centre. And\nyes, the irony of Felix moving into por-taka bins while builders take over the current office is not lost on me. - Ed\nThe Imperial College BBk \u2022 \u2022\nSummer Ball\n\n"
