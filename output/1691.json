The entire cast\n\u2013 28 people strong \u2013 line\nthemselves up along the\nfront of the Lyttelton\nTheatre\u2019s stage, barely\nmanaging to all fit on,\nbefore launching into an a\ncapella rendition of \u00c9dith\nPiaf\u2019s \u2018La Vie en Rose\u2019,\nfollowing which the\ncurtain rises on a salubri-ous, battered drinking den\nin the heart of London.\nAs the introduction\nsuggests, the play is most\ncertainly an ensemble\npiece, with characters\u2019\nstory arcs weaving and\nthreading over each other,\nfor better or worse. And\nthe cast isn\u2019t the only jam-packed thing about it \u2013 the\nproduction clocks in at\naround three hours, with\ntwo breaks, and while\ndirector Joe Hill-Gibbins\nmanages to make it seem\nshorter, it maintains a\nsense of bloat.\nHill-Gibbins\u2019 decision\nto keep things ticking\nalong rather rapidly,\nmaking ample use of the\nstaging to create a frenetic\natmosphere, is an smart\none, presumably done\nto make the stage seem\na bit like a spinning top,\nliable to topple over at\nany second. However,\nwhat actually happens is\nthe characters can come\nacross as over-chore-ographed, the mania\ncoming and going but\nalways somehow leaving\nenough space for the main\naction to play out.\nOut of this fog of cigarette smoke and spilled\ndrinks, certain stand-out\ncharacters emerge: the bar,\n\u2018La Vie en Rose\u2019, is run\nby Christine Foskett (Kate\nFleetwood), who veers\nfrom abrasive to humble,\nblaring out drink orders\none minute and baring\nher soul the next. She is\njoined by Hugh Marriner,\na gay author who hasn\u2019t\npublished any stories\nfor years, and spends his\nnights getting drunk in La\nVie en Rose, surrounded\nby fellow lost souls. They\nare supported by a varied\ncoterie of grotesques and\nGIs \u2013 Liza Sadovy is\nwonderfully off-putting\nas \u2018The Treacle Queen\u2019,\nwhile Jonathan Slinger\u2019s\nsleazy film director\nMaurice Hussey displays\na razor-slash of a smile as\nhis lecherous hands roam.\nAt the best of times,\nthe stage becomes like\na vast vision of hell, like\nsomething by Hieronymus Bosch, with the huge\nmirror to one side of the\nset reflecting back the\naction, slightly distorted\nand incredibly menacing.\nBut these moments come\ntoo few and far between.\nThere are several points\nwhere the chaos breaches\nthrough a fine veneer of\nartifice, and the play feels\ntruly alive, like an Otto\nDix painting \u2013 the scene\nat the end of the first act,\nwhere masked GIs pour\ninto the bar is the most\nchilling example \u2013 but for\nthe most part the action\nalways feels somewhat\nconstrained.\nWhen Absolute Hell\n\u2013 initially called The\nPink Room \u2013 was first\nperformed in 1952, it all\nbut sunk King\u2019s career, as\ncritics lined up to discredit\nit as tawdry and sordid.\nIt wasn\u2019t performed\nagain for more than\nthree decades, and in the\ninterim relaxed censorship laws allowed King\nto rewrite certain parts of\nit, making the references\nto sexuality much more\novert. Unfortunately, in\nthe interim, he did little to\nallow the characters to put\non a good show.\nThe script essentially\ncircles around the same\npoints again and again.\nIt\u2019s presumably done in\norder to highlight how\ncrippled the characters\nare, trapped in their cycles\nof loneliness and misery,\nbut it results in a severe\nand bitter lack of devel-opment, frustrating the\naudience. We may understand why the character\nkeep returning to La Vie\nen Rose again and again,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean we\nwant to stay there any\nlonger than is necessary.\nFor a play that tests\nthe audience\u2019s endurance\nto succeed, it needs to be\nable to capture their attention throughout. Absolute\nHell is epic in size, but\nnot, unfortunately, in\nscope. While the themes\nit throws up are precinct \u2013\nand all the more relevant\ntoday, loneliness being an\neternally-modern malaise\n\u2013 and the casting generally impressive, King\nseems to be rehashing the\nsame points over and over\nagain. Part of the play\u2019s\nnature is in its bloated\nstructure, but one can\u2019t\nhelp but wish Hill-Gibbins had taken a bit of a\nknife to the production,\nleaving its most affecting\nmoments to gape open,\nraw and bloody.\nThe stage is stalked,\nduring the majority of\nthe play, by a sex worker\nwalking the streets.\nAlways looking straight\nahead of her, with a dead-eyed stare, she jangles\nher keys in an attempt to\ndrum up trade, prowling\non the edge of the action.\nShe looks sinister, and\nmenacing, and \u2013 above\nall \u2013 tired. By the time the\ncurtain comes down, I can\nsympathise.\nThe National Theatre\u2019s production of Rodney King\u2019s bawdy mediation on isolation, Absolute Hell, has moments\nof magic, but they are few and far between in the bloated structure.\n\u2018Hell is other people\u2019 // Johan Persson\nARTS\nFred Fyles\nArts Writer\nWhere?

I had\na whole diatribe planned,\nwhere I would outline why\ndemocracy was so impor-tant, how vital it is for the\ngovernment to listen to the\nvoices of younger voters,\nand the inspirational men\nand women who have\ncampaigned for universal\nsuffrage. Trust me, it was\ngoing to be great. Pulitzer\nPrize to the usual address,\netc.\nUnfortunately,Irealised\nthat \u2013 while I might write\nthis column while the\npolls are still open \u2013 this\nissue is going to published\nlong after voting is all\nover, and the dust has\nsettled. So instead you\u2019re\ngoing to have to read what\nyou read every week:\na poorly-thought out,\nbarely readable stream of\nconsciousness, powered\nby the twin engines of a\nlooming deadline and a\ndesire to just go home and\nsleep. Enjoy.\nThis week has, for\nme, seen cause for both\ncelebration and conster-nation. This Wednesday\nwas the postgraduate\ngraduation ceremony (no\nmatter how many times\nI say it, it still sounds\nclunky) \u2013 hundreds of\nstudents who had finished\nmasters degrees or PhDs\ncame back to Imperial,\nblack cloaks flapping in\nthe wind and rain, surrounded by proud family\nmembers jostling for\nprime photo-opportunity\nposition outside the Royal\nAlbert Hall. I always\nrather enjoy graduation\ndays \u2013 not because of the\nactual ceremony itself, but\nrather because the sight of\nthe proud graduands/grad-uates (I don\u2019t care about\nthe difference, don\u2019t @\nme) is pretty wholesome,\nand makes it seem like the\nexperience so many of us\ngo through will be worth\nit in the end.\nAnd this brings us\nonto a less pleasant point:\nlast week, the Complete\nUniversity Guide released\ntheir UK league tables, in\nwhich Imperial climbed a\nrank to 4th\nin the country.\nHowever, one metric\nwhere Imperial fell down\ncompared to other universities was in the student\nsatisfaction portion of the\nrankings. Some depart-ments, in particular, had\ngreat scores for research\nquality or job prospects,\nbut pretty dire ones for\nhow happy their students\nwere.\nThe Department of\nPhysics, in particular, had\nlow student satisfaction\nscores. This isn\u2019t a new\nproblem: the satisfaction\nrates have been slowly\ndropping over the past\nfew years, with National\nStudent Survey responses\nhighlightingconcernsover\nassessment, feedback, and\nthe lack of a sense of com-munity. To get a better\nidea of what the problems\nwere in the department,\nI went to the voices\nthat really matter \u2013 the\nstudents. They described\na \u2018hostile environment\u2019,\nwhere undergraduates all\ntoo often feel like a low\npriority in comparison to\nthe research that goes on\naround them.\nThe department is\ndoing things to try and\nfix this, and it should\nbe welcomed, but it\nreflects a general issue\nover the stress many\nstudents go through to\nget an Imperial degree.\nOne student I spoke to\nsaid they\u2019d regretted the\namount of stress they\u2019d\nput themselves under, and\nhow it had numbed them\nto constant pressure. So\ndespite the joyful faces of\nstudents at graduation, I\nstill have to wonder: is it\nall worth it?\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

Felix has just\ncaught up with him to hear about the perks of off-season travel to North American national parks.\nT\nhere are many\nvalid reasons\nwhy you should\nvisit North\nAmerica\u2019s national parks\nin high season. It\u2019s when\nthe weather is reliably\ngood, when the flowers are\nin bloom, or when certain\nwildlife encounters are\nthe most likely. However,\nhigh season comes at a\nprice, and not just literally.\nMany of North America\u2019s\nmost popular national\nparks have become very\ncrowded, with excited\nvisitors hunting for\nperfect Instagram shots.\nThe wardens are facing\nhuge challenges in managing visitor numbers in\na sustainable way, which\nallows people to enjoy the\noutdoors but also protects\nthe habitats and species\nwithin the park. So let me\nmake a case for off-season\ntravel.\nRedwood National\nand State Parks\n(California)\nThe Redwood parks\nprotect just under half\nof all remaining coastal\nRedwoods, the tallest\ntrees in the world. The vast\nmajority of these magnificent trees have fallen\nvictim to logging in the\npast, and since re-grow-ing them literally takes\nhundreds to thousands of\nyears, restoration of this\nold-growth temperate\nrainforest is a long game.\nFor now, these relatively\nsmall protected parks\nlend themselves to be\nexplored on an awesome\nroad trip along the coast\nof Northern California.\nThere\u2019s a number of spectacular scenic drives right\nthrough the forests, which\nare very busy with cars in\nhigh season, particularly\non weekends, and you\u2019ll\nlikely spend some of your\nvaluable holiday time\nlooking for a parking\nspace. In December, we\nonly had to share the place\nwith some deer roaming\nundisturbed.\nAs stunning as the\ndrives are, to really\nexperience the Redwood\nforests and appreciate\nthe size of these trees,\nyou\u2019ve got to go for a\nwalk in the woods. The\nmost striking thing for me\nwas the incredible silence.\nThe huge trees and the\nthick undergrowth muffle\nessentially all noise, and\nI\u2019ve never been in a place\nas quiet as this. But to\nenjoy the marvellous tranquillity of the forest, you\nwant only a small number\nof cars and hikers in the\npark \u2013 another reason for\noff-season travel.\nDenali National Park\nand Preserve (Alaska)\nHome to North America\u2019s tallest mountain,\nDenali, this park protects\nA small fraction of what the Yosemite National Park has to offer // Konstantin Holzner\nOut of season in North America\u2019s national parks\nincredible wilderness\nfull of mountains and\nwildlife but the access\nis very limited all year\nround. Although in the\nmain season you can\ndrive farther into the park\nusing their tour buses\n(private vehicle access\nis restricted), I highly\nrecommend the off-sea-son, particularly if you\u2019re\ninto backcountry hiking.\nDuring the summer\nmonths, backcountry\npermits are booked out\nmonths in advance, and\npeople queue from very\nearly on in the morning\nfor a small number of\npermits allocated on the\nday. When we went hiking\nthere in late September,\nwe were the only people\nwith a permit camping out\nin the entire six million\nacres.\nThere aren\u2019t many\npaths in the park, and\nmost backcountry exploits\ninvolve advanced navigation with a map and\ncompass, picking your\nown route (it\u2019s possible\nto book tours with experienced back-country\nrangers). On our first day,\nwe followed a river bed\ncovered in animal tracks.\nMoose, wolves, and grizzlies are all very active\nthere. Within ten minutes\nof pitching our tent we\nsaw two moose appear\nout of the forest. The next\nmorning, we woke up in a\nfew inches of snow and on\nour way back saw which\nanimal tracks were fresh.\nAnother advantage of\nthe off-season is that the\nflightseeing tours from\nnearby Talkeetna through\nthe mountains (optional\nglacier landings available)\naren\u2019t fully booked, so\nyou can just rock up when\nthe weather is perfect.\nAlthough expensive, the\nviews are spectacular!\nTombstone Territorial\nPark (Yukon, Canada)\nThis relatively young\npark, located near the\nsouthern terminus of\nthe infamous Dempster\nHighway, protects an\nincredible array of rugged\npeaks. Wilderness permits\nare also usually booked\nout months in advance\nfor the summer months.\nIn September, however,\nwe had no trouble obtaining a permit to hike\nto Grizzly Lake, and the\nautumn colours in the\npark are spectacular. We\ncamped out there for two\nnights (didn\u2019t see any\ngrizzlies though) and\nwere treated to the most\namazing sunset, followed\nby an incredible display\nof northern lights \u2013 you\ndon\u2019t get those during\nthe summer either \u2013 that\nmade even the Canadians\nin the neighbouring tent\n\u201cooohh\u201d and \u201caaahh\u201d in\nawe.\nYosemite National\nPark (California)\nChances are your\nlast laptop shipped\nwith one of Yosemite\u2019s\nstunning granite walls\nas a background picture.\nIt\u2019s certainly the most\nbreath-taking North\nAmerican national park\nI\u2019ve been to but also one\nof the busiest. During\nhigh season, people queue\nfrom early in the morning\nfor a chance to pitch their\ntent in the infamous Camp\n4. The valley floor is super\nbusy, and so are the more\naccessible hikes. Glacier\nPoint is probably one of\nthe most Instagrammed\nplaces on earth, but the\nroad to get there is closed\nduring the off-season and\nyou can only reach it by\nfoot. So when you\u2019ve\nhiked up there, you\u2019re\nalmost certainly alone.\nAnd even if you\u2019re not,\nyou can be certain that the\nothers have also earned\nthat spectacular view. If\nyou\u2019re hungry for more,\ncontinue on along the apt-ly-named Panorama Trail\nfor more stunning views.\nOne of Yosemite\u2019s free\nshuttle buses will take you\nback to where you started\nin no time, and some\ndrivers will even sing you\na song or tell you stories\nof the park\u2019s history.\nTombstone Territorial Park in Yukon surely looks inviting // Konstantin Holzner\nKonstantin Holzner\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\nTrying to be edgy at the Canyon // Edita Pileckyte\nEmpty off-season roads in Death Valley // Edita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor Edita Pileckyte continues on the topic of North America\u2019s famous national parks, with pros & cons\nof guided tours as an alternative to travelling by rental car.\nGrand Canyon and Death Valley: the pride of South-West USA\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nTRAVEL\nD\nuring my three\nday stay in\nLas Vegas, I\ndecided to visit\ntwo of the most famous\nNorth American national\nparks \u2013 Grand Canyon in\nArizona and Death Valley\nin California. They were\na huge contrast from the\nbusy and posh Vegas,\nand were an integral part\nof my US experience.\nWhile one day is more\nthan enough for the\nfamous casino and party\ncity, even if you\u2019re keen\nto visit every single hotel\non the Strip, the parks are\nso huge (and so far away\nfrom the city) that you\ncould easily spend a few\ndays there and still have\nlots left to explore.\nGrand Canyon\nTour companies offer\none- or two-day trips to\nSouth or West Rims of\nthe canyon, each a bit\ndifferent to suit everyone\u2019s taste. For example,\nthe South Rim tours are\nusually the cheapest,\nwhile the West Rim tours\ninclude a skywalk (at\nextra cost) and a visit to\na local Native American\nvillage. Most companies\nalso offer a helicopter tour\nfor an additional fee.\nI visited the South Rim,\nand the tour included a\nstopover at the Hoover\nDam and Lake Mead. We\nalso passed the Colorado\nRiver. At the canyon, we\nwere given three hours\nto walk around, most\nof which was spent just\nwalking along the edge\nof this never-ending,\nbreath-taking natural\nwonder, reading about\nits history along the way\nand admiring the views.\nThere were also a couple\nof points to climb down\nfor a challenge and a more\nInstagrammable view.\nDeath Valley\nAlso unbelievably\nhuge, the Death Valley\nnational park offers a\nrange of unforgettable\nsights. The most famous\none is the Badwater Basin,\nthe second lowest point in\nthe Western hemisphere,\nconsisting of salt deposits.\nAnother impressive place\nis the Artist\u2019s Palette \u2013 a\nrange of dunes made of\ncolourful sand. Besides\nthat, you can find sand\ndunes, rocks, trees, and\nsome short vegetation in\nthe Valley if you know\nwhere to go. I didn\u2019t\nmanage to see the whole\npark in my one-day tour,\nespecially since it took\na while to get there from\nVegas. On the plus side,\nwe came back to Vegas\nrather early which allow\ned us some time to explore\nthe city.\nGuided bus tours: yay\nor nay?\nBefore going to any\nnational park, it\u2019s important to decide whether\nyou\u2019re renting a car or\nbooking a tour, since\nthere\u2019s usually no chance\nof reaching them by\npublic transport (or the\nhassle is real). The biggest\ndisadvantage of the tours\nis the price (e.g. $200pp\nfor Death Valley), which\nis much more expensive\nthan a rental car and\nthe park entrance fee,\nespecially if you split the\ncost among a group of\ntravellers. Also, the tours\ndon\u2019t give you enough\ntime to explore the area\nat your own pace or stop\nanywhere you want (and\nlonger trips with overnight stay naturally cost\neven more).\nHowever, having a\nguide is handy since\nyou not only get to hear\ninteresting facts about\nplaces you\u2019re passing\nby but also don\u2019t have to\nworry about getting lost\nor experiencing problems\nwith the car, which, for\nexample, can spontaneously stop working in the\nextreme heat in the middle\nof the desert. In my case,\nthe weather in Grand\nCanyon happened to be\nmuch different from hot\nand dry +40o\nC in Vegas\n\u2013 it was rainy, windy, and\nyou could see lightning\nbolts in the distance.\nAnd though I couldn\u2019t\ncomplain \u2013 I was at the\nfreakin\u2019 Grand Canyon\nwith a double rainbow in\nthe sky \u2013 I have to admit\nI was relieved knowing\nmy bus will take me back\nto my accommodation\nsafely. If I had drove there\nby myself and wandered\nsomewhere far away along\nthe narrow paths, getting\nsuddenly caught in such a\nstorm in the middle of the\nCanyon would not have\nbeen fun. Finally, the tours\nalso supply unlimited\nbottled water that comes\nin handy in the heat as\nwell as modest breakfast\nand lunch.\nOverall, I\u2019d say the\nguided tours are safer and\nmore reliable than going\non your own and might\nbe worth the extra money\nbut they won\u2019t allow you\nenough time to explore\neverything in your own\ntime as you\u2019ll always be\non a tight schedule, with\nno flexibility. But if you\u2019re\nconfident enough to opt\nfor a rental car, make sure\nyou\u2019re well prepared and\nhave GPS signal!\n\u201dHaving a\nguide means\nyou don\u2019t have\nto worry about\ngetting lost or\nexperiencing\nproblems\nwith the car\n(which can\nspontaneously\nstop working\nin the extreme\nheat)\u201c\n\n"

The\nexhibition displays the\nnatural with the unnatural,\nwith a bizarre juxtaposition of real animal bones\nand furs next to dresses\ndesigned to turn women\ninto the living embodiment of flowers. The\natmosphere feels slightly\njarring, with recordings\nof birdsong mixed with\na mechanical clacking\nof looms and sewing\nmachines.\nAnd yet the designs\nare beautiful, celebrating\nnature through floral\n\u201cThe\nexhibition\ndisplays the\nnatural with\nthe unnatural\nin a bizarre\njuxtaposition\u201d\n\u201cFashion\nadapted to\naccommodate\na desire for\nchange,\nproviding a\nmedium for\nreflecting\nsocial\nconcerns\u201d\nprints and exotic natural\nmaterials, meeting our\naesthetic desire for something new. Through its\ndisplay of fashion from\nthe 1600s next to natural\nhistory specimens and\nnew innovative fabrics,\nthe exhibition asks us to\nlook frankly at the past\nand make up our own\nminds on whether or not\nwe can design a more\nsustainable future for the\nindustry.\nFor all the beauty of the\nclothing and drawings,\nthe exhibition leaves you\nfeeling uncomfortable\nas you read about the\ndamage the industry has\nhad on the environment.\nThe mechanisation of\ncloth production in the\n1700s was one of the main\ndrivers of the industrial\nrevolution; the industry\nboomed as the population\nof Britain tripled during\nthe following century.\nMore and more coal\nwas used to fuel the high\nvolume of production,\npolluting the air and\nwater. Our desire for the\nexotic led to the poaching\nof exotic animals for their\nfurs, hides, and feathers.\nDisplayed, we see female\ncorsets and dresses\nstiffened with baleen,\nor whalebone, and hear\nabout how this trend led\nto the severe over-hunting\nof whales.\nAnd yet, despite all\nof the damage, we see\nhow humans have been\ninspired by nature; the\nuse of fur and feathers\nin fashion was paired\nwith a significant societal\ninterest in natural history\nand botany, demonstrated\nby a multitude of floral\ndesigns, and detailed\ndrawings from books\npublished in the same era.\nAs the exhibition\ntransports us into the\n20th\ncentury, we see\nhow fashion adapted to\naccommodate a desire\nfor change, providing a\nmedium through which\nwe could reflect our social\nconcerns.\nBy the 80s a number\nof popular designers were\nstarting to use fashion as a\nway of raising awareness\nto the damage humans\nare doing to the planet.\nT-shirts started carrying\nslogans, encouraging\npeople to think and act\non topics such as nuclear\nweapons, famine, and the\nenvironment. Alexander\nMcQueen used prominent\nimages of nature to make\nus consider our attitudes\ntowards the environment\nand Stella McCartney\naimed to combine great\ndesign with sustainable\nmaterials. We are brought\ninto an era of \u2018eco-fashion\u2019\nwhere consumers are now\nencouraged to ask, \u2018how\nare my clothes made?\u2019and\n\u2018who made them?\u2019.\nHaving seen how\nfashion can be used to\nspreadideas,weareshown\nhow designers have catalysed innovations which\nare making textiles and\nmanufacturing processes\nincreasingly environmentally friendly. We see the\nstunning Calvin Klein\ndress worn by Emma\nWatson to the Met Gala\nin 2016 which was made\ncompletely of recycled\nplastic bottles. Eco-hybrid\ndesigns, cellulose couture,\nmodern leather grown\nfrom mycelium, a dress\ngrown from roots. You\ncan hear Vivienne Westwood\u2019s vision of moving\ntowards a sustainable\nfashion future come to\nlife. Her advice: \u201cbuy less,\nchoose well, make it last\u201d.\nThis thought-provoking\nexhibition gives a frank\nand, ironically, unattractive history of fashion, but\nit also highlights the role it\nhas played and still plays\nin spreading ideas and\nshaping culture.

Until 27 Jan 2019\nHow Much? \u00a310 students\nFASHIONED FROM\nNATURE\nfashion industry, I find\nmyself optimistic.\nThough fashion may\nThe photographer as painter, sculptor, artist\nTate Modern\u2019s Shape of Light exhibition is a great history lesson in abstract photography, but neglects\ncontemporary post-1970s technology and artwork.\nF\nrom the dawn\nof the age of\nthe camera,\nphotography as\nan artistic medium has\nbeen consistently set apart\nfrom the tradition of fine\nart. Henry Fox Talbot,\none of the fathers of the\nphotographic process,\nwrote in the mid-19th\ncentury that photographic\nplates \u201care impressed by\nthe agence of Light alone,\nwithout any aid whatever\nfrom the artist\u2019s pencil.\u201d\nHere was a medium that\ncould represent the world\naround us as it really is,\nand whose starting point\nis not the intangible\nartistic imagination, but\nthe concrete physical\nreality of light. In a turn\nof phrase characteristic of\nthe new possibilities photography posed, he called\nphotos \u201cthe sun-pictures\nthemselves.\u201d\nIt is against this dichot-omy, which places photography as a counterpoint\nto fine art, that the curators\nof the Tate Modern\u2019s latest\nexhibition rail. Set out as\na \u2018manifesto exhibition\u2019,\nShape of Light aims to\ntrack a century of abstract\nphotography, and \u2013 in the\nprocess \u2013 break down\ndistinctions, placing the\nphotographer on an equal\nlevel with the sculptor\nor painter. They already\nhave, as their starting\npoint, a model for how to\ngo about doing this: 291,\nthe legendary art gallery\nmanaged by Alfred\nStieglitz, aimed to place\nphotography on the same\nlevel as more accepted\nart forms, proving it\ncould be a medium just\nas artistically fecund as\noils or marble. As viewers\nprogress through the ex-hibition, we can see how\nartists attempt to build up\nthe essence of abstraction\nthrough the developing\nlanguage of photography\n\u2013 a language that is still\ndeveloping today.\nThe pioneers of the\npractice of abstract\nphotography are present,\nas you would expect:\nMan Ray, Lazslo Moholy-Nagy, Paul Strand.\nIn Man Ray\u2019s case, the\ncurators have managed to\nsecure a series of his \u2018Unconcerned Photographs\u2019,\ntaken by swinging a\npolaroid camera around,\nleaving it to chance what\nwould be in the viewfinder\u2019s range when the\nshutter closed. The work\nacts as a playful corrective to the output of more\nformal photographers,\nreminding us that abstract\nphotography can be just as\nmuch about joy as about\ntechnique.\nBy showing photos\nalongside sculpture and\npaintings, the curators\ndraw our attention to how\nphotographic technique\ndeveloped alongside\nartistic movements,\nand \u2013 in certain cases \u2013\npreempted them. Thus\nAlvin Langdon Coburn\u2019s\n\u2018Vortographs\u2019, a term\ncoined by Ezra Pound,\nhang alongside Vorticist\nwork by Wyndham\nLewis \u2013 one black\nand white, the other in\neye-popping colour, both\nare linked through their\ndizzying visuals. In other\nrooms we\u2019ve got Bridget\nRiley\u2019s op art alongside\nGottfried J\u00e4ger\u2019s math-ematics-inspired pho-tography; Moholy-Nagy\u2019s\nstructured photographic\ncompositions acting as a\ncounterpoint to Theo van\nDoesburg\u2019s paintings; the\nautomatism of Nathan\nLerner\u2019s abstractions hung\nnext to one of Pollock\u2019s\npaint-splattered canvases.\nThe shadow of the\npioneers of the early-20th\nCentury \u2013 namely those\nwho emerged from\nthe Bauhaus, and the\nAmerican photographers\nthey inspired \u2013 hangs\nheavy over the exhibition,\nbut the curators do well\nto remind us how international these working\npractices were.\nA collection of images\nfrom Latin America,\nfeaturing everyday items\nin repetitious close-up,\nare arrestingly beautiful,\nwhile Chinese amateur\nLuo Bonian\u2019s works from\nthe 1930s use cut-up techniques to create swirling\nsepia-toned kaleidoscopes\nof imagery. Kansuke\nYamamoto\u2019s 1956 sculpture \u2018The Thrilling Game\nRelated to Photography\u2019\nserves as an emblem for\nthe exhibition as a whole:\na small box containing\nan photograph of glass\nshards, pierced with the\nshards themselves, it\nbreaks down our separate\nconception of \u2018sculpture\u2019,\n\u2018art\u2019, and \u2018photography\u2019\ninto a single entity, whilst\nalsoretainingasharpsense\nof playfulness. Works like\nthese, little seen within the\nmainstream photographic\ncanon, are the highlights\nof the show.\nFrustratingly for an\nexhibition that promises\nto cover a century of\nthe artform it insists on\nfocusing on the history\nof abstract photography\npre-1970, at the exclusion\nof more recent works and\nwithout consideration to\nthe impact of new technologies on the ability\nof artists to create their\nvision.\nA single room at\nthe end of exhibition\naffords us the chance to\nmove into the world of\ndigital photography. Paul\nGraham\u2019s highly-magni-fied scans of reels of film\nreveal the crystals and\npigments which make up\nphotographic technology,\narranged into beautifully\ndynamic patterns that\nare given evocative\nnames like \u201cEnd of an\nAge\u201d. Elsewhere, Antony\nCairns\u2019 frenetic photographs of bustling cities\nhave been transferred onto\neReader screens, whose\nimmobility \u2013 detached\nfrom their casing, they\nhang inert \u2013 contrasts with\nthe high-energy scenes\nportrayed, and Thomas\nRuff has done away with\nthe photographic process\nall together, creating a\n\u2018digital darkroom\u2019 in a\nmarriage of art and auto-mation.\nWriting in the late\n1970s, Susan Sontag\nspoke of how American\nphotography was\nbecoming defined by a\nUnconcerned Photograph (1959) \u2013 playful, serendipitous shots // Man Ray\nreaction against \u2018Westonism\u2019 \u2013 \u201cthat is, against\ncontemplative photogra-phy, photography considered as an independent\nvisual exploration of\nthe world.\u201d Much has\nhappened since that time,\nand yet \u2013 by not showing\nus how abstract photography has moved on since\nthe 1970s \u2013 Shape of\nLight merely cements a\nnarrative that was never\nin question. As a history\nlesson, it is exceptional,\nbut as an exhibition it\nleaves much to be desired.\n\u201cThis\nexhibition\ngives a frank\nand, ironically,\nunattractive\nhistory of\nfashion\u201d\nseem fickle, if we look\nback over the last century\nwe can find a number of\nconstants: a love of detail,\nhigh quality materials,\nhigh standard of work-manship, and a search for\nsomething new. As \u2018conscious\u2019 clothing becomes\nincreasingly fashionable,\nit will become ever more\navailable, as high street\nbrands adopt and adapt\nto the latest innovative\ntechniques and textiles.\nBut even if you can\nbe convinced that we are\nheaded towards a greener\nfuture, I have to ask, are\nyou prepared to forgive\nfashion for its damaging\npast?

Bojack, a washed-up\nstar of a 1990s sitcom,\nspends his days drinking\nheavily, and pushing away\neverybody who cares for\nhim as his self-hatred\ndeepens.\nThose he alienates\ninclude his agent Princess\nCarolyn \u2013 a magnificent\nAmy Sedaris in a ca-reer-best performance\n\u2013 who puts on a bright\nattitude to cover up\nwhat\u2019s lacking in her\npersonal life; and Diane\nNguyen (Alison Brie), a\nghostwriter with ideals\nand intellect, trapped in\na world of showbiz and a\nmismatched marriage.\nWhile the premise\nmight sound disillusion-ing, the script keeps things\nengaging, shot through\nwith a morbid wit and a\npenchant for wordplay.\nClocking in at 25 minutes\neach, the episodes deal\nwith sensitive subject\nmatter in a clear and\nemancipatory manner.\nBesides, after watching a\ncouple of episodes, your\nlife might not seem quite\nso bad.\nAvailable on Netflix\nMidnight Diner: Tokyo\nStories\nBased on a manga\nseries, Midnight Diner:\nTokyo Stories is one of a\nnumber of foreign series\npurchased by Netflix as\npart of its all-consuming\nexpansion.

It\u2019s a\nsmall town located on the\nvery northernmost edge of\nOregon, on a strip of land\nthat abuts the Columbia\nriver as it bleeds into the\nwide Pacific. To look at\nimages of Astoria is to\nlook at a town confronted\nby the ocean; the landscape slopes down to the\nbay, from which a solid\nsteel bridge spans the dual\nhorizontals of sky and\nwater.\nThis openness, this\nsense of expanse, or\nhorizontality, bleeds\ninto Grouper\u2019s musical\noutput, which has always\nexplored a liminal space\nbetween intimacy and\ndistance. It sounds like\nsecrets whispered into a\nvoid, which the listener is\nprivileged to hear. She has\npreviously spoken about\nhow releasing an album\nwas, to her, like sinking an\nobject into a lake, unseen,\nbefore quietly stealing\naway. As such, listening\nto Grouper always feels\nlike a privilege, and \u2013\nsometimes \u2013 like a trans-gression.\nGrid of Points is a\nconcise work \u2013 lasting\nonly 22 minutes in\ntotal \u2013 but continues the\ntrajectory set out by her\nearlier, longer releases.\nSince her breakout album,\nDragging a Dead Deer up\na Hill, Grouper has gradually shifted away from\nreverb-loaded guitars and\nsynths, which stretched\nlike mist along an empty\nfield; instead, she has\nbegunusingamoreprecise\ncollage of piano, vocals,\nand musique concrete \u2013 it\ngives a greater sense of\nimmediacy, and hints at\nthe person behind the\nproject. The seven songs\non Group of Points form\na companion piece to her\n2014 acclaimed album\nRuins, but remain a point\nof departure.\nOpening track, \u2018The\nRaces\u2019, which comes in\nat under a minute, acts\nlike a signal of intent for\nGrouper, setting the tone\nfor the rest of the album.\nMulti-layered vocal tracks\ncreate a choral blast of\nsound, reminiscent of\nwork by fellow ambient\nmusician Julianna\nBarwick. The remainder\nof the songs, built around\npianos, place Grouper\u2019s\nvocals front and centre, in\nhazy pieces that, though\nexperimental,remainopen\nand accessible. Songs like\n\u2018Blouse\u2019, built around\nslowly progressing chords\nwhich slowly work their\nway towards the sublime,\nsee Grouper\u2019s vocals\nbleeding over the top of a\npiano base. \u2018Parking Lot\u2019\nsimilarly sees Grouper\nechoing alongside ghostly\npianos.\nGrid of Points is\nan album built around\nnegative space; silence\npervades the songs,\nwhich are like fine\nbolts of lace, defined by\nabsence. In tracks like\n\u2018Birthday Song\u2019, the\npiano and vocals simply\nfade away, a slight pause\ndemarcating phrases. In\n\u2018Driving\u2019, meanwhile,\nwhich follows on from\nthe gradual dimming of\n\u2018Parking Lot\u2019, this silence\nis broken by an unsteady\nintake of breath, as if\nGrouper is steeling herself\nARE YOU INTERESTED IN\nPARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH?\nAt Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in West\nLondon we are interested in finding out the effects of\nhormones that control reproduction.\nWe are looking for healthy men (who do not smoke\nand do not take any medication) aged between 18\nand 40 years.

In an\ninterview with Pitchfork,\nshe put it: \u201cthis music is\na room that I take care\nof, I help decide what is\naccepted. Here distortion\nand mistakes, silence,\ndeep sadness, and mis-understanding, they all\nhave a place.\u201d Grid of\nPoints is an album that is\nhumanistic, generous, and\nuplifting.\nThe recordings, which\nwere conducted in 2014 in\nnorthern Wyoming, were\nbroken off after Grouper\nfell ill; the music reflects\nthe cold snap that was\noccurring outside at the\ntime, as well as the fever\nthat forced her to stop\nrecordings. Nevertheless,\nthe album, although short,\nis a whole body of work.\nIn the last song, \u2018Breathing\u2019, the vocals and piano\nare cut across by a field\nrecording of a coal train\nthundering by. But rather\nthan simply using it as\na punctum to close the\nalbum, Grouper allows it\nto linger for its entirety; as\nthe seconds, then minutes,\npass by, the listener appreciates small details, which\n\u2013 like much of Grouper\u2019s\nwork \u2013 linger long after\nthe sound has faded away\nMUSIC\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nArtist: Grouper.

In singing\nabout oppression, forbidden love, and the struggle\nto be free in Cindy\u2019s guise,\nshe joined the tradition of\nartists like Ann Leckie,\nwho see stories about\nArtificial Intelligence\nto be more than science\nfiction fantasy divorced\nfrom the world around us,\nbut rather as metaphors for\nthe lives of people who are\nmarginalised and do not\nfit the mould of the rich,\ncis, straight, white, and\nmale. Cindy, for Mon\u00e1e,\nwas a way of speaking out\nwhilst keeping her listeners at an arm\u2019s length \u2013 we\nwere able to know about\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s feminism, her\npolitics, but not about her\ntrue passions.\nIn the five years since\nthe release of her last\nalbum, The Electric Lady,\nMon\u00e1e has appeared\nin the Oscar winning\nMoonlight, about a young\nblack gay boy growing up\nin Florida, and in Hidden\nFigures, where she played\nthe first black woman in\nAmerica to gain a degree\nfrom a white college\nduring the Jim Crow era.\nIn hindsight, these roles\nseem like the prelude to\nDirty Computer, an album\nthat, at its heart, wants to\nbe a touchstone for people\nwho do not easily get\nrepresentation in mainstream culture. With a\ntitle that hints at the sexy,\nsubversive, and (emo-tionally) compromised\nsongs that lie within, this\nalbum is Mon\u00e1e\u2019s most\nconfessional. Finally, we\nsee Mon\u00e1e step out of\nCindy\u2019s shadow and share\nher unfiltered self.\n\u201cThe transformation\nof silence into language\u201d\nwrote Audre Lorde \u201cis an\nact of self revelation\u201d. Listening to Dirty Computer\nis the act then of witnessing Mon\u00e1e finding her\ntruest voice after so many\nyears of silence. We get\nthe sense that she has felt\nburdened by her evasion:\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live on\nmy knees/I just want to\ntell the truth\u201d she declares\nin \u2018Crazy Classic Life\u2019, a\nsmooth R&B track that\nis louche and hedonistic\non the surface, but barbed\nwith emotional punch. It\nisn\u2019t hard to read between\nthe lines to figure out what\nthe truth that has been\nhaunting Mon\u00e1e is: questions about her sexuality\nhave followed her since\nher debut album. \u2018Pynk\u2019,\na collaboration with\nGrimes, appears half way\nthrough Dirty Computer\nto lay the rumours to rest.\nIt is a blissed-out, airy,\nfunk celebration of the\nfemale gaze and sapphic\ndesire, and about as\nexplicit as you could ask\nfor \u2013 in a fun, erotic, and\nsomehow rather touching\nrun of lyrics, Mon\u00e1e\ndetails all things pink:\ntongues and vaginas, yes,\nbut also eyelids, brains,\nhearts. The accompanying\nvideo underscores the\nqueer vibes: in several\nscenes Mon\u00e1e sports a\npair of gloriously unsubtle\nvulva trousers with Solange-like insouciance as\nmaybe-girlfriend Tessa\nThompson pokes her head\nbetween the singer\u2019s legs.\n\u201cPink\u201d, Mon\u00e1e concludes,\n\u201cis the truth you can\u2019t\nhide.\u201d\nThe exuberance of\n\u2018Pynk\u2019 is reflected in the\nafro-beats stylings of \u2018I\nGot the Juice\u2019, a track\nfeaturing Pharell, the\nsynth heavy \u2018Make Me\nFeel\u2019 which is suffused\nwith Prince\u2019s influence,\nand \u2018I Like That\u2019, an ode\nto self love and resilience.\nIn other places, we see\nMon\u00e1e the activist take\ncentre stage: in \u2018Screwed\u2019,\na sex-drenched pop\nnumber featuring Zo\u00eb\nKravitz, Mon\u00e1e offers\ncommentary on sex,\npower, and inequalities.\nThe nihilism of \u2018Screwed\u2019\nshows hints of an anger\nthat is refined and amplified in the magnificent\n\u2018Django Jane\u2019, a swag-gering, braggadocious rap\ndistillation of her speech\nat the Women\u2019s March\nin 2017. Referencing\neverything from Pussy\nRiot to Shonda Rhimes,\nthe feminist polemic ends\nwith the fantastically arch\nline \u201clet the vagina have a\nmonologue\u201d.\nYet throughout, Mon\u00e1e\ncircles back to truth-tell-ing \u2013 its liberations and\nthe dangers that allowing\nyourself to be visible\nbring. In the opening\nbars of \u2018Don\u2019t Judge Me\u2019\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s voice is gravelly,\nalmost hoarse; raw in\na way that is entirely\ndisarming. \u201cEven though\nyou say that you love me/\nIs it me or do you love\nmy disguise?\u201d she asks\nus. Organ refrains weave\ninto the psychedelic-funk\ncadences of the following\ntrack, \u2018So Afraid\u2019, hinting\nperhaps to Mon\u00e1e\u2019s\nreligious upbringing and\nstruggles to reconcile her\nfaith with her sexuality.\nThat the album\u2019s bright\nharmonies, purposeful\ndefiance, and joyful,\nexhilarating guitar riffs\nhave this undercurrent\nof melancholy makes\nDirty Computer perhaps\nthe most compelling and\ntrue representation of a\ncoming out experience.\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s talent and bold\nambition has always set\nher apart, her newest\nalbum reveals a side of her\nheretofore unseen. Rather\nthan the other-worldly\nCindy who kept the world\nat bay, this is a woman\nwho, despite her fears, has\nunflinchingly embraced\nher truth, dared to be\nvisible as a black, queer\nwoman \u2013 a combination\nthat the world doesn\u2019t\nalways welcome. Dirty\nComputer is Mon\u00e1e at her\nmost human, most vulner-able, and most powerful;\nit cements her as one of\nmusic\u2019s true icons.\nMUSIC\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nArtist: Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\nLabel: Wondaland.

By 2014,\nFacebook had updated\ntheir terms and conditions\nwhich no longer permitted\nnew 3rd\nparty applications\nto harvest friends\u2019 data or\nbe used for psychometric\nprofiling. However this\ndid not apply to the application that Kogan had\nbuilt in the previous year.\nIn early 2014 Kogan had\nbeen introduced to SCL\nElections and in May of\nthe same year formed the\ncompany Global Science\nResearch (GSR) to create\na data-licensing contract\nbetween itself and SCL\nElections, an affiliate of\nCambridgeAnalytica. The\ncontract stipulated that\nthe funding transferred to\nGSR was to be used \u201cto\nfurther develop, add to,\nrefine, and supplement\nA deep dive: Cambridge Analytica\nC\na m b r i d g e\nAnalytica have\nbeen successfully controlling\nthe minds of thousands of\npeople \u2013 if not hundreds\nof thousands \u2013 since 2013.\nWorking for political parties for over 200 elections\nin the United States and\nthe United Kingdom, as\nwell as Argentina, the\nCzech Republic, Kenya,\nIndia, and Nigeria, they\nmay have singlehandedly\nswung the outcome of\ntwo controversial knife-edge votes. In 2016\nthey acted in the U.S.\nPresidential Elections and\nlikely the U.K. European\nReferendum \u2013 the full\nextent of their actions may\nnever be known.\nIt all began on the\n21st\nApril, 2010, when\nFacebook announced\nOpen Graph, a tool for 3rd\nparty application developers allowing them to ask\nthe user for permission\nto access their personal\ndata; at the time this also\nincluded access to the\npersonal data of all the\nfriends of a user. As of\n2017, the average number\nof \u2018friends\u2019 for every\nprofile was 338 people\n(median at 200); given\nthe number of people\nwho directly accessed\nthe app is anywhere from\n185,000 to 300,000 we\nhave an enormous amount\nof potentially affected\npeople. Cambridge Analytica claim the number\nof people whose data was\nharvested was 30 million,\nwhilst Facebook claim\nthis number is 87 million.\nWhichever way you look\nat it, the sheer amount of\ndata that could have been\nsourced surpasses the\nlevel of current known\nGS psychometric scoring\nalgorithms, databases\nand scores\u201d from which\nKogan and his partner\nJoseph Chancellor could\nnot profit directly from.\nThe Guardian published an expos\u00e9 in\nDecember 2015 on the\ninvolvement of Cambridge Analytica in aiding\nTed Cruz\u2019s presidential\ncampaign with the use of\nFacebook user data. After\nthis publication Facebook\nceased their collaboration\nwith Dr. Kogan and asked\nhim to delete all the\ndata acquired by GSR.\nFacebook and Dr. Kogan\nhad a close relationship,\nwith Facebook sharing\naggregate user data to\nfeed into GSR models.\nThese models were used\nby GSR to match personalities with voter record\ndata provided by SCL\nElections to be able to\ntarget voters.\nThe contract between\nGSR and SCL Elections\nstated that the predictions\nmade by this model were\ncomparable to, if not more\naccurate than, those made\nby close acquaintances of\ntest groups. This claim,\nhowever, is unsubstantiated and there is no reason\nto believe that targeting\non an individual basis was\npossible. This does not\nmean that group targeting\nwas not possible with\na sufficient prediction\nrate for it to be viable:\neven with a conservative\n50% correct prediction\noutcome on a group size\nof a couple of hundred\ncan be an important factor\nwhen some elections were\nwon by a few hundred\nvotes. Once Cambridge\nAnalytica established\ntheir target groups, media\ncontent would be created,\ncurated, and published\nbased on the groups\u2019\npersonal interests and\npolitical beliefs; they\nwould then would use\nmarketing platforms with\nspecific targeting tools,\nsuch as Facebook itself, to\nreach voters with the right\nmaterial.\nSomething that might\nhit closer to home is with\na company called AggregateIQ, who were affiliated with the SCL group,\nthe parent company of\nCambridge Analytica.\nAggregateIQ was hired by\nthe \u2018Vote Leave\u2019campaign\nteam called BeLeave,\n\u00a3625,000 was donated\nfrom the official Vote\nLeave campaign for the\nreferendum, all of which\nwas used to pay AIQ for\ntheir services. In total\n\u00a33.5 million was paid to\nAIQ for their services by\nthe different Vote Leave\ncampaigns.\nIt would be impossible\nto ever estimate how\nsuccessful Cambridge\nAnalytica, SCL Elections,\nand Global Science\nResearch were at converting masses of data\ninto votes; however, these\nevents show us some\nof the more dangerous\neffects of powerful\ncomputing technology\nwe have developed. Social-media services like\nFacebook are wielding\npowerful currency in this\nnew age, this currency\nbeing our personal data.\nWith millions of people\nsharing data publicly\nwith minimal privacy\nrestrictions, it becomes\nincreasingly profitable to\nrecord and store as much\ndata as possible on as\nmany people as possible.\nIn a dystopian society it is\neasy to imagine governments going through all\nour data and controlling\nwhat we see on a massive\nscale. Legislation can at\nbest control where our\ndata is stored, who it is\nshared with, and what the\ndata is used for, however\nit is slow to be written and\nimplemented. It will be\nextremely difficult to take\nback control of our data.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned before the parliament to defend Facebook\u2019s blunder // Flickr/Anthony Quintano\nTECH\nHubert Kaluzny\nTech Writer\n\u201cIt will be\nextremely\ndifficult to take\nback control of\nour data\u201d\nUsing mass surveillance, big data, and machine learning to control your mind.\n\n"

As I\nlooked through the crowd\nof students desperately\nnavigating their parents\nand loved ones to the\nceremony, to be seated\nnowhere near one another,\nit struck me that all of\ntheir faces bore the same\nexpression: relief. I think\nthat probably sums up the\nImperial experience that\nwe were all mis-sold when\nfilling out the UCAS form\nall that time ago. Thank\nfuck it\u2019s over.\nThe weather really went\nfor exactly the same thing\nas well. Not dramatic rain,\njust a persistent drizzle to\nmake all the photos look\nforeboding and miserable,\na further reminder of the\ntrue Imperial experience.\nI unfortunately had to\ncome in on the day of\ngraduation and everyone\nwas using umbrellas,\npossibly the most lethal\ntool a small-statured\npedestrian can possess\nshort of an RPG-7. I\nassume that people use\numbrellas to protect their\nexpensive outfits, hat, and\nhair from the onslaught\nof said light drizzle, but\nis that worth the cost\nof someone else having\nto perform an inelegant\nballet to navigate through\nthe crowds? There must\nbe a better way to protect\none\u2019s garments from the\nrain without causing inconvenience to everyone\nelse. Possibly some kind\nof rigid head condom. I\u2019ll\nhave a chat with Des Eng,\ngive them something to do\nother than eating rubbers\nand shoving pencil leads\nup their noses.\nAll of this just to\nprotect the gowns they\nmake you hire for the\nceremony, atop whatever\nfancy clothes that people\nhave chosen to wear. The\ngraduation ceremony as a\nwhole is an over-expen-sive opportunity to get\na handshake from Alice\nGast. It\u2019s highly likely that\nthe whole expense of the\nevent just about covers the\ncost of her time to shake\nall of your grubby hands\nand pretend that this is\nanything special to her,\nbefore the next trainload\nof gullible money cows\narrives in October.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong,\nI\u2019m sure the graduation\nceremony is extremely\nmeaningful to some\npeople and it is a celebration of your achievement\nat university. I just wish\nit wasn\u2019t so expensive\ngiven that the faculty\nhave essentially admitted\nthat the tuition fees only\ncover the cost of the piece\nof paper they present at\nthe end. Personally I\u2019d\nprefer it if they stuck to\nthe tie honoured tradition\nof workplace leaving\ndos: not-memorable and\nregretting it the morning\nafter, but at least it comes\nwith a free mug.\nGrumpy Bastard\nextends their congratulations to those graduating\nand wishes them well\nfor the next 40 years of\ndrudgery before their\ninevitable descent into\nchronic illness and death.\nLove the gown! // Imperial College\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you!

Soft, yes,\nbut structured. Perfect for\nspreading your favourite\nbreakfast topping onto,\nbe that Nutella, jam or\nmarmalade.\n5. Aperitivo is the\nperfect budget dinner\nDoes an all-you-can-eat buffet and a cocktail\nfor 10 euros sound good\nto you? In London, just\nthe cocktail alone can cost\n\u00a310. The Italian aperitivo\nis a pre-dinner drink\noften accompanied by\nSeven things I learnt about Italian food from my trip\nto Rome\nItalian food is not just pizza and pasta. Food Editor Alice Davage learnt more about the celebrated cuisine during\nher Easter travels and wants to tell you all about it. Lucky you.\nFOOD\nAlice Davage\nFood Editor\nL\net\u2019s face it, one of\nthe main reasons\nwhy people visit\nItaly is for the\nfood. Yes, there is also\nbucket loads of history\nto gaze at in awe and the\nsunshine is a nice change\nfrom the UK, but really,\nthe food is the main event.\nWhen I say \u201cItalian food,\u201d\nwhat comes into your\nmind? Pizza and pasta?\nMaybe gelato? While\nvisiting a friend on her\nErasmus year abroad in\nRome, I endeavoured\nto scratch beneath the\nsurface of the average\npizza crust and find out a\nbit more about the local\ncuisine and how the locals\ntreat their food. Read on\nto find out what I learnt.\nSpoilers: it\u2019s not just\nabout the carbs; although,\nthey are mentioned a lot.\n1. Whipped cream on\nice cream works\nThis is not unheard of\ncream on top of scoops of\ngelato in Rome. Cream on\ncream - too much? British\npeople mix custard with\nice cream after all, which\nis a much quirkier combi-nation. Why don\u2019t we add\nwhipped cream here? The\nnext London Instagram\ncraze, anyone?\n2. Fondant chocolate in\nice cream is magic\nWhile we are on the\ntopic of gelato, I tried\n\u201cIced\nespresso... a\nmuch needed\nmid-afternoon\npick-me-up\u201d\nfreezer sections.\n3. Truffle is multi-func-tional\nImagine this: a beautiful platter laden with a selection of cheeses, hams,\nolives and bread covered\nin poppy seeds in a little\nred basket on the side.\nOne mystery cheese sticks\nout. Originally, I think\nthe mystery ingredient\nlooks like a cross between\nolives and mushrooms.\nAfter tasting it I decided\nit was neither and looked\nquizzically at the friend\nsitting across me.

The entirety of\nour educational experience has suffered because of the strikes.\nCOMMENT\nStudents of Imperial\nComment Writers\nE\narlier this year,\nwhile academic\nand support staff\nwere exercising\ntheir right to strike in protest against unfair changes\nto their pensions, over\n3,000 students signed a\nletter to senior management asking for a partial\nrefund in tuition fees. As\na result of the industrial\naction, many of us lost out\non contact time, support\nfrom staff, and general\nmomentum. If, as seems to\nbe the case across the UK,\nuniversities are business-es, and we are consumers,\nthen we have the right to\ndemand a refund.\nThese concerns have\nbeen presented to the\nsenior management of the\nCollege, but the response\nwe have received has\nbeen lacking. Last month,\nseveral of us heard from\nProfessor Alice Gast per-sonally, who sent a statement that has also been\nuploaded to the Imperial\nwebsite. It reads: \u201cfees\ncover all aspects of your\ntime at Imperial, and are\nbased on the delivery of\noverall outcomes, rather\nthan being payments for\nspecific contact hours.\u201d\nWhile we appreciate\nProfessor Gast recognises\nthis is about more than just\ncontact hours, we hope\nthat by overall outcomes\nshe does not solely mean\nour degree certificates.\nInstead, they should refer\nto the graduate attributes\nlisted on Imperial\u2019s own\nwebsite. Imperial are\n\u201ccommitted\u201d to ensuring\nImperial graduates will\n\u201cDemonstrate deep conceptual understanding of\ntheir chosen discipline\u201d,\n\u201capproach challenges\nwith curiosity, critical\nthinking, and creativity\u201d,\nand \u201chave developed\ninto independent learners\nwith high self-efficacy\u201d,\namong others.\nTo achieve these\naspirational outcomes\nrequires departments to\ndeliver the pedagogical\napproach outlined in the\nexcellent new Teaching\nand Learning Strategy.\nLaunching this strategy,\nProfessor Simone Buitendijk, Vice Provost\n(Education), noted the\nemphasis on interactive\nlearning, with \u201ca focus\non increasing the sense of\ncommunity and working\nwith student as partners.\u201d\nwhile Ms Giskin Day, an\nImperial College Principal\nteaching fellow, envisaged\nclassrooms as \u201cinteractive\nfacilitative space(s)\u201d\nwhere dialogue rather\nthan didactic delivery was\ncentral to learning.\nWe entirely agree\nwith this visionary and\naspirational strategy, and\nwelcome its implementation at Imperial. However,\nProfessor Gast appears to\ndiscount the view that our\neducation had suffered\nand as a result, and avoids\nthe question of the college\u2019s liability to refund\nany of our fees.\nWhile our fees are not\nfor specific contact hours,\nit is precisely because we\nhave lost this contact time\nthat we have lost the opportunity for dialogue and\ninteraction, both of which\nare central to the College\u2019s\neducational strategy. As a\nresult our education has\nsuffered. Indeed, this is\nthe basis of our claims for\ncompensation. On many\ncourses, both undergraduate and postgraduate,\nwe are fortunate to be\npartners with our lecturers\nin this excellent type of\neducation; however, it\ncannot take place when\nour lecturers are on\nstrike. The educational\nexperience, which was the\nreason that we chose to\ncome to Imperial, is what\nwe value so highly, and\nnot just the outcome.\nOur educational experience should not be\natomised into specific\ncontact hours, but should\nrather be based on the\ntotality of our learning\nexperience. This requires\nour teachers and fellow\nstudents to be present\nin the department, at\nseminars, in classes,\nand on-line \u2013 and not\non strike. The key point\nwe were making in our\ncorrespondence with the\nCollege is that we have not\njust lost specific contact\nhours but also momentum\nand the excitement and\ncreativity that comes from\nan excellent course. It is\nour educational experience in its entirety that has\nsuffered as a direct result\nof the disruptions arising\nfrom the strike.\nDespite assurances\nfrom senior management\nabout mitigations for the\nstrike, these have necessarily been minimal and\nin no way compensate for\nour loss. The fact remains\nthat our lecturers were on\nstrike for 14 days in the\nSpring Term \u2013 more than\na quarter of the total term.\nRecovering lost teaching\n\u2013 funded by the college\n\u2013 may help to some\nextent but needs to fit into\nstudents\u2019existing commit-ments. Full time students\nare very stretched already,\nwith multiple commit-ments, and few have\ncapacity to retrace steps\nfrom the previous term.\nEven if it were feasible to\nreschedule lost teaching,\nthe practicalities of doing\nso from the student\u2019s point\nof view are therefore very\nlimited. And without full\nstudent participation and\ninteraction as partners in\nlearning, the educational\nexperience is considerably\ndiminished. Therefore it\ncan never simply a matter\nof replacing missing\nteaching sessions at a\nlater date, particularly for\nthe practical courses that\nwere cancelled and which\nmay be essential for some\nstudents in their future\ncareers.\nThe sad fact is that\nstrikes mean lost produc-tion. This is the reason that\nthe College are withholding pay from our excellent\nlecturers who went on\nstrike. It seems disingenuous to us that they can\ntherefore also assert that\nwe have not suffered a\nloss in our education and\nare not due a refund. For\n14 days we were unable\nto meet with our lecturers\nwho were union members;\nwe missed scheduled\nteaching sessions; we lost\nopportunities to learn.\nThis is what the totality of\neducation means to us and\nnot just the final degree\noutcome.\nWe would like the\nCollege to meet with us\nand our union representatives to agree a way\nforward that respects\nstudents\u2019loss of education\nexperience through fair\ncompensation. We feel\nprivileged to be students\nat Imperial and are fortunate to be receiving an\nexcellent educational ex-perience. This, however,\ndid not happen whilst\nour lecturers were on\nstrike. We need to agree\na fair and just formula\nto compensate, not only\nourselves, but the 3,000\nfellow students who have\nsigned the letter stating\nthey believed their education would suffer.\nFelix will be publishing\na version of this article\nonline as an open letter.\nIf you would like to put\nyour name to it, please\nfill in the form: https://\ngoo.gl/forms/gt5Y4H-PQvpO6R3C52\nSomeone looks concerned // Joseph O\u2019Connell-Danes\n\n"

Why? It was time\nfor the LUCA (London\nUniversities and Colleges\nAthletics) outdoors athletics series, beginning at\nParliament Hill athletics\ntrack. On 15th\nApril, the\nfirst meeting kicked off,\nwith competitors from all\nacross London battling\nto top the points table\ngoing into the second\nevent of the series. The\ncomplete range of events\nwas on offer, from steeple\nchase to javelin, and this\nevent provided a perfect\nopportunity for the many\nfirst-timers to get introduced to the sport.\nBy 9am, we had\nplanted the Imperial flag\nand the team was all set\nto over-enthusiastically\ncheer on their fellow\ncompetitors. The day\nbegan with the signature\nevent of this meet, the\n10,000m, followed by\nthe 1500m. ICXCAC\nexcellent performance too\nfrom Helena Dona in the\nwomen\u2019s race.

In a turn of\nevents that seems right out\nof a postmodern satire, the\nnews of his ill-health was\nannounced on his daughter\u2019s Instagram account.\nOut of this chaos\nand turmoil, the Uzbek\nnovelist Hamid Ismailov,\nwho was forced to flee\nUzbekistan in 1992 for\nBritain, had his first Uzbek-language novel published in the Central Asian\nnation in 25. Literature,\nlike life, finds a way.\nThe novel that was\npublished, The Devil\u2019s\nDance, now finds its\nway into English-readers hands, thanks to a\ntranslation from Donald\nRayfield, printed by\npublishers Tilted Axis.\nRayfield, working closely\nwith Ismailov and fellow\ntranslator John Farndon,\nhas produced a moving\ntranslation that flows\nbeautifully, while retaining a number of stylistic\nand structural elements\nthat could make the translation difficult.\nThe Devil\u2019s Dance\nreads something like a\ncross between classical\nCentral Asian poetry and\na postmodern deconstruction of the function of the\nnovel. The story primarily\ncentres around the life\nof Abdulla Qodiriy,\nperhaps the most popular\nUzbek novelist of the\n20th century, although\nlittle-known in the West.\nOpening with Qodiriy\ntending to his garden,\nsuffused with the idea for\na novel that \u201cwould be a\nterrific story, surpassing\nboth Past Days and The\nScorpion from the Altar\u201d,\nhe is quickly arrested by\nthe Soviet secret police,\nas part of Stalin\u2019s Great\nPurge. Ismailov immediately plunges us into a\nworld of political prisoners and jail cells, intrigue\nand horror.\nWithin this framework,\nIsmailov takes us inside\nthe mind of Qodiriy as he\nstruggles to conceive of\nthe uncompleted novel \u2013\nEmir Umar\u2019s Slave Girl \u2013\nand try and finish it within\nthe cold walls of his cell.\nThis secondary novel, set\nduring the \u2018Great Game\u2019of\nthe 19th century, in which\nEnglish and Russian spies\nwormed their way into the\nroyal courts of Central\nAsia, centres around\nOyxon \u2013 a poet and\nqueen, passed from ruler\nto ruler, trapped within the\nconfines of palaces. It\u2019s a\nmore palatial setting that\nQodiriy\u2019s, but it\u2019s still a\nprison.\nIsmailov plunges\nus deep into a world\nof double-crossing,\npoetry-spouting royalty,\nintroducing a retinue of\nhistorical figures, such\nas Nasrullah, the ruler\nof Bukhara, Emir Umar,\nthe leader of Kokland,\nand Nodira, his beautiful\nwife, and one of the most\nacclaimed Uzbek poets of\nthe age.\nQodiriy develops a\ndeep identification with\nOyxon, whose predicament resembles his own:\n\u201conly when he know\nOyxon\u2019s life from beginning to end would he\nbe able to bring his own\nlife to its conclusion\u201d,\nIsmailov writes. Qodiriy\nimplores God to allow\nhim out \u201csafe and sound;\nthen he would finish his\ntale of Oyxon and follow\nit up with a new, more\nhard-nosed novel, set in\nmodern times.\u201d He never\nmakes it out, instead being\nexecuted in the October\nfollowing his arrest. The\nnovel he is constructing in\nhis head during his prison\nsentence is lost, and it is\nup to Ismailov to reconstruct it for us.\nThe novel, with its\nfoundations deeply set in\nCentral Asian literature\nand poetry, mines both\nOne Thousand and One\nNights, and the lyrical\npoetry of the 19th century\nas inspiration. And yet\nunlike Scheherazade, who\nneeds to keep on telling\nstories to secure her safety,\nQodiriy is acutely aware\nof the limitation time has\non his imagination: \u201cA\nThousand and One Nights\ngoes on and on only in\nfairy tales\u201d, his jailers tell\nhim, \u201cWe can put a stop to\nthis right now.\u201d\nIt is this undercurrent of\never-present danger that\ndrives him in a quest for\nsurvival, as he attempts\nto hold on until he can\ncomplete the novel. In\nIsmailov\u2019s exploration of\nthe nature of literature, he\nhighlights the difference\nbetween the conception\nand completion of a\nnovel, as well as the\nreasons behind the drive\nto create art. The novel is\n\u201can enquiry into a human\nbeing\u2019s spirit, his identity,\nin much the same way as\na prison interrogration,\u201d\na jailer informs Qodiriy,\nhighlighting the power\nand violence of writing.\nFor Ismailov\u2019s Qodiriy,\naswellasQodiriy\u2019sNodira\nand Oyxon, writing has an\nintoxicating power over\ntheir own lives, and the\nlives of others. Qodiriy\nis \u201caware of the effect\nthat the \u2018made-up\u2019 could\nhave on real life\u201d, and\nthe threat that his writing\nwill \u201cvanish without a\nHamid Ismailov // Index on Censorship\n\u201cIt is a novel\nthat celebrates\nthe rich history\nof Central\nAsian culture\n\u2013 one political\nrepression\nthreatened to\nerase\u201d\ntrace\u201d hangs over him.\nAs one aphorism quoted\nin the book goes: \u201cSaying\n\u2018halva\u2019 once doesn\u2019t bring\na sweet taste to your\nmouth, but after a hundred\ntimes, your teeth will start\nsticking together\u201d.\nInterspersed with\npoetry translations from\nFarndon, The Devil\u2019s\nDance is a novel that\ncelebrates the rich history\nof Central Asian culture\n\u2013 a culture that political\nrepression threatened\nto erase. From descriptions of Uzbek nature\nand food \u2013 the rice dish\nplov is frequently mentioned \u2013 to celebration\nof the Uzbek language,\nIsmailov\u2019s novel is a vital\nintroduction to a world I\u2019d\nnever encountered before.\nWhile it can be a bit\nheavy going for readers\nlike me, with no exposure\nto Central Asian culture,\nand many of the historical\nreferences flew straight\nover my head, it remains a\nbeautiful and nuanced exploration of what it means\nto be a writer.\n\n"

It is\na gut-wrenching experience to be so profoundly\nneglected and shunned by\nthe nation you have lived\nin and paid your dues.\nTo be denied the right\nto access healthcare and\nthe right to work for the\nsake of meeting migration\ntargets is disgusting.\nThe government\u2019s\nhandlingofthescandalhas\nbeen dire to say the least.\nThe now former Home\nSecretary, Amber Rudd,\nwas either incompetent\nor deceitful \u2013 in reality\nprobably both. She failed\nto comprehend the nature\nand scale of the problem,\nnot only when it was\nraised with her last year,\nbut also as the scandal has\ndeveloped this year. The\ngovernment have failed\nto go far enough to show\ngenuine contrition for the\npain they have caused, nor\ndone enough to resolve\nthe situation for the thousands of people who have\nbeen affected.

The NHS have\nrecognised the importance of getting qualified\nstaff in place as quickly\nas possible to support the\nhealth service; it\u2019s a shame\nthat the government have\nbeen unable to recognize\nthis fact despite the NHS\nfalling apart around them.\nRegardless of whatever\nimmigration targets the\ngovernment has foolishly\ntied its hands to, it should\nbe brave enough to say\nwe need doctors urgently\nand that it is committed to\nsorting this problem.\nThe road the government has decided to\nfollow on immigration\nwill not benefit anyone.

    "content": "MUSIC\nFRIDAY, 4TH\nMAY, 2018 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n22\nA wrong, mostly short history of punk rock, part III\nHank finally got his shit together sufficiently to write the third and final installment of Felix Music\u2019s history of the\nnittiest, grittiest genre that\u2019s ever graced a recording booth. Unfortunately, he still can\u2019t write consistent titles.\nT\no all of my\nreaders waiting\nfor this a month\nago \u2013 sorry, the\nend of term got messy,\nand I never finished the\narticle. Not that you (as\nin, my readers) exist, I just\nthought I\u2019d take the opportunity to flatter myself.\nNow, on to history.\nDespite all the over-ea-ger commenters throughout the years claiming\nthat \u2018punk is dead,\u2019 it\nnever went away. To this\nday, you can find thriving\nscenes from the gutters\nof Jakarta to here in\ncentral London. The basic\ntenets \u2013 the disrespect for\nestablished customs, the\naggression and frenetic\nenergy, and the do-it-yourself ethic \u2013 have all\ninextricably manifested\nthemselves in contemporary music.\nBut such abstract\nconcepts associated with\npunk rock, nowadays,\nare by-and-large\ndivorced from the Punk\nRock Sound of old. For\nexample: drumlines. Historically, punk\u2019s always\npreferred minimal com-plexity, maximal energy;\nhit the snare a square\nfour times per bar and be\ndone with it. When there\nwere variations, they were\ndistilled and rehashed; for\nexample, D-beat (named\nafter the band Discharge)\nis a relatively tricky fill for\nthe untrained drummer,\nbut they play the same\nfill at the same tempo for\nalbums at a time. That\nsubgenre, by the way, is\npredictably called D-beat.\nOver such a\nlong time, though, these\nsorts of approaches have\nfaded away; the no-rules\napproach holds for punk\nrock itself ultimately, and\nit is this very trait that\nallows the punk rock ethos\nto recycle itself and stay\nrelevant across decades.\nPunk\u2019s not dead, it\u2019s just\nin hiding.\nThis is the point at\nwhich modern punk\ndiverges, in terms of com-position, timbral palette,\nthematic approach, and\nso on; punk lives on, as\na set of ideals, versus a\nparticular music scene.\nThe landscape of\nmodern punk is quite\nscattered. Many of the old\ngiants are still around; you\ncan still go see shows for\nBad Religion, NOFX, The\nDescendents, Bad Brains,\nand so on. Quite a few,\nnaturally, have broken\nup; sometimes, though,\nthey reformed(ish). For\nexample, Op Ivy called\nit quits before their first\nalbum even dropped, but\nTim Armstrong and Matt\nFreeman then formed\nRancid in \u201891, and they\u2019re\nstill going.And Streetlight\nManifesto and Propagandhi are still sticking out\ngreat stuff (if you can call\nthe pace Streetlight works\nat \u201cactive\u201d).\nThen there\u2019s pop\npunk, a (some would\ncall unfortunate) genre\nblending emo, pop, and\nsomething approximating\na punk rock sound. There\nare too many bands to\ncount; some big ones are\nRise Against, Yellowcard,\nSearch the City, and so on.\nThe largest acts are un-doubtably Paramore, Fall\nOut Boy, and Green Day.\nThey\u2019re labeled as \u201cpunk\u201d\nbecause many emerged\nfrom the punk scene \u2013\nGreen Day was big in\nthe 80s and 90s, and their\nfirst major-label effort\nDookie is a classic album.\nLikewise, Pete Wentz of\nJeffrey Lewis. The fusion\nis marked by acoustic,\neclectic instrumentation;\nusually horns, a double\nbass, and an acoustic\nguitar that sounds like\nsomeone beat the shit out\nof it before they picked it\nup and started strumming\nas fast and hard as they\ncould.\nhave sought to recreate\nSpringsteen. It\u2019s a whole\nnew generation of Americana, and it sounds fan-tastic; The \u201859 Sound and\nHandwritten are absolute\nessentials.\nBands have also\nfollowed in Joy Division\nand New Order\u2019s foot-steps; Protomartyr comes\nto mind as an example\nof what I might call Rust\nBelt wheeze-punk, with\nsongs that sound like the\nurban decay they were\nborn in.\nQueercore and Riot\nGrrrl are genres that came\nout of the LGBTQ+ and\nfeminist movements; in\nthe former, there are bands\nlike the Violent Femmes\nand Pansy Division, while\nthe latter gave birth to the\nheadline-grabbing Pussy\nRiot \u2013 famously jailed for\nprotesting Putin. I should\nnote here that while\npunk has a reputation for\nmachismo, the space is\nquite open and accepting;\nmost punks at shows have\nfairly far-left political\nviews. It\u2019s really funny\nwatching some dude on\nstage scream about how\ntheir shows should be a\nsafe space \u2013 not to discourage the moshers, just\nto make sure individuals\nwho belong to minority\ngroups feel welcome.\nAnd that, at the end of\nthe day, is what defines\npunk rock for me. It\u2019s not\njust about the music \u2013 it\u2019s\nabout getting up on stage,\nmaking as much noise as\npossible, and building a\ncommunity rooted in that\nspecial kind of catharsis\nthat belongs uniquely and\ntotally to punk rock.\nAnd that\u2019s the allure;\nthe camaraderie, the inten-sity, the crowdsurfing and\nmoshing \u2013 it all builds up\nto something much greater\nthan the sum of its parts,\na vibrant and vivacious\nmish-mash that stands as\ntestament to individuality\nand community, to good\ntimes and bad, to the full\npalette of human emotion.\nFew genres have made\nsuch an impression on\nme. Punk rock will always\nhave a place in my heart.\nReverb\u2019s one hell of a drug. Look what it drives people to. Quit dream-pop before it\u2019s too late. // Andrew Jackson Jihad\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nFall Out Boy got his start\nin Racetraitor, playing\nthe Chicago scene while\nit thrived (where he often\nshared the stage with Tim\nfrom Rise Against). It\u2019s a\nshame how they disintegrated \u2013 now they make\nmajor-label electro-pop\nand sound blander than\never.\nThere are fusion\ngenres, too. Bands like\nSlowdive and Godspeed\nYou! Black Emperor\ninherited quite a bit from\nthe DIY ethic, but turn\nthe tempo down waaaay\nlow; the latter lives in\na commune in Quebec,\nwhere they have their\nstudio. Hip-hop caught a\nmajor wave as well, with\nartists like Danny Brown\nand Death Grips being\nprime examples.\nFolk-punk was kick-started by the Violent\nFemmes; the genre has\nsnowballed in modern\ntimes. Recent successes\ninclude Andrew Jackson\nJihad, Days\u2019n\u2019Daze,\nJohnny Hobo and the\nFreight Trains, and\n\u201cPunk rock\nstands as\ntestament to\nthe full palette\nof human\nemotion.\u201d\nGrindcore is a joke\ngenre. The verses are\nusually incomprehensible\nnoise. Anal Cunt comes\nto mind \u2013 with songs like\n\u2018I Went Back in Time and\nVoted For Hitler\u2019 and \u2018I\nLit Your Baby On Fire\u2019\ncounting among their\nleast offensive songs.\nThe Gaslight Anthem\n\n"

While\nanimal models have\nproven to be useful, in\nsome respects, they do\nnot wholly mimic human\nreactions.\nOne of my lecturers\u2019\nfavourite examples is thalidomide \u2013 a mild sleeping\ntablet that was proven\nsafe in adults. Animal\nstudies and human drug\ntrials failed to detect its\nharmful effects on developing foetuses, and, as a\nresult, in 1962 thousands\nof babies worldwide were\nborn with malformed\nlimbs.\nThis disaster led to increased stringency of the\ndrug testing process, but\ndid not reduce the fears\nof expecting mothers \u2013\npregnant women are less\nlikely, for example, to\ntake long or short-term\nmedications to help\ncontrol their symptoms of\ninsomnia.\nHowever, a recent study\nin March by a research\ngroup in Syracuse University, New York may\nhave just found a reliable,\nclinically-relevant model\nto allow drug safety\ntesting in embryos! This\ninvolves using stem cells\n\u2013 unspecialised cells that\ncan be turned into different type of cells, such as\nheart cells. By utilising\nbioengineering principles,\nthe research group in US\nwere able to generate a\nheart in the early stages of\ndevelopment using stem\ncells.\nCurrent problems with\ngrowing a developing\nheart (also known as\ncardiac organoid) in the\nlaboratory centre around\nthe immaturity of the\ncells themselves. Those\nthat were grown on a dish\nare simply not the correct\nshape or orientation, and\ntherefore they have different functional properties\nto those inside a human.\nTo resolve this, the\ngroup used biomaterials\n\u2013 substances that are able\nto interact with cells \u2013\ncombined with stem cells,\nto drive stem cell special-isation into heart cells, as\nwell as encouraging cell\nmaturation. The group\npatterned the biomaterial\nby creating the correct\ngeometric confinement on\nthe biomaterial, and, con-sequently, a 3D cardiac\ncell culture that mimics\nearly heart development\nwas able to be formed\nin approximately three\nweeks.\nSince human stem cells\nare used, these organoids\nare well suited for drug\nscreening, because it\neliminates the species difference between animals\nand humans; this means\npatients can now have\ngreater confidence when\ntaking medications, and,\nperhaps, fewer animals are\nrequired for drug testing.\nIn parallel, understanding\nthe factors that influence\nhuman heart development\nmay allow for the study\nof developmental heart\nabnormalities, allowing\nscientists to find treatments for congenital heart\ndefects.\nThe technology is still\nin its infancy, and the\napplications may only be\nlimited to early defects\nat present. Furthermore,\nthere are still discrepancy\nbetween the heart that\ngrows inside a human,\nand that which is grown\nin the lab. More research\nis required, but the future\nprospects remain exciting.\nScience and eternity \u2013 perspectives on immortality\nO\nne of the most\nrecent hot\ntopics in the\nfield of science\nand technology centres\naround Netcome \u2013 a private company who have\nset out to preserve human\nbrains post-mortem, such\nthat, one day, following\ntechnological advance-ments, they would be\nable to \u201crecreate your\nmind\u201d. Nectome bases\ntheir business plan on\naward-winning research\nwhich resulted in the\nintact preservation of\nan animal connectome.\nThis was done via a\nprocess called vitrifix-ation: a combination of\nchemical embalming and\ncryogenics which enabled\nthe team to preserve all\nthe synaptic structures\nwithin a rodent.\ncality. Neuroscience poses\ndifficult questions, some\nof which have answers\nthat would prove crucial\nfor this project, such as\nthe fact that it is currently unknown whether\nan intact cryogenised\nconnectome would retain\nthe information that once\ncirculated through the\nbrain. Moreover, we do\nnot know whether the\ninformation we want to\nretain is actually related\nto the biological basis of\nconsciousness. For vitri-fixation to be successful,\nthe brain needs to be\nremoved fresh; while the\nprotocol for replicating\nthe procedure for human\nuse is currently under\ndevelopment, this very\nidea of transhumanism is\nmore entertaining, from a\ndebate point of view, than\never.\nIt is not often that\nscience reaches out to\npeople en masse, evoking\nsuch strong emotional\nreactions, as with the\npossibility of eternal life.\nLooking back in history,\nimmortality has always\nembraced many spiritual\ndimensions, as seen with\nthe ancient Egyptians,\nwho were well known for\npreserving their leaders\u2019\nremains, some of which\nstill exist day.\nThe novel approach by\nNectome sounds appeal-ing, especially in cases\nwhere terminal illnesses\nare involved. However,\nthe implications of such a\nproject becoming reality\nare immense: ethically,\nlegally, and in terms of\nthe future of the human\nrace. Since brain collection must be completed\nimminently at death, this\nprocedure could only be\nconducted in countries or\nstates where assisted euthanasia is legal. Provided\nthe protocol is successful,\nthe person would lose\ntheir body, and possibly\nwake up to the prospect\nof having a conscious\nexperience in a research\ncomputer.\nThis scenario is riddled\nwith questions. What\nwould initially be a collection of independent\n\u201cconsciousness folders\u201d\non research computers\nmay one day become\nthe one and only means\nof human existence. We\ncould look at it as an\nevolutionary success, as\na new paradigm where\nwe confront another type\nof mortality and begin\nthe same cycle again, as\na way of achieving unity\nand connection with each\nliving human. Or, from a\ndifferent perspective, this\nwould create a collective\nconsciousness and serve\nas a path to losing what\nwas initially aimed to\nbe preserved, the ego,\ninstead reaching a point\nwhere everything currently known to us through\nour subjective experiences becomes nonsensical.\nImportant advances\nand discoveries are still\nto be made, both in neuroscience and technology,\nbefore we can unequivocally develop a protocol\nthat would enable human\nconsciousness to live\nforever in a computer\nsimulation. Until then, we\nhave to answer questions\nsuch as: \u201cWhat, in fact,\nare we trying to achieve\nwith this?\u201d\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nMaria Balaet\nScience Writer\n\u2018Siri, find me a picture of science\u2019 // Wikimedia\n\u201cIt is not often\nthat science\nreaches out\nto people\nen masse,\nevoking\nsuch strong\nreactions\u201d\nThis achievement,\nhowever, has not yet been\nreplicated in humans, and\nthe outline of their project\nhas received criticism for\nits methodological practi-SCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nS\nome of you may\nhave recently\nread that the last\nmale northern\nwhite rhinoceros, called\nSudan, was put down\ndue to age-related\nailments. The northern\nwhite rhinoceros is a a\nnow functionally-extinct\nsubspecies of the white\nrhinoceros, with only\ntwo females remaining.\nThis day was imminent\n\u2013 with such a small\nsurviving population\nsize, their chances to\nrecover seemed unlikely.\nHowever, what has\nbeen ignored by several\nmedia outlets is that the\nsouthern white rhino is\nsomething of a conservation success story.\nIt is still argued whether\nor not the southern and\nnorthern white rhinos\nrepresent subspecies\nof the white rhino, or\nwhether they are two\nentirely separate species.\nFor arguments sake, we\nare going to assume,\nusing current knowledge,\nthat they are both closely\nrelated subspecies.\nLet\u2019s start with the\nsouthern white rhino,\nwhich experienced a population crash, with reports\nfrom the early 1900s that\nas little as 50-100 individuals remaining in the wild.\nBut, thanks to population\nrecovery efforts across the\nglobe, the southern white\nrhinos have bounced\nback, with a population\nsize today amounting to\nover 21,000! Of course,\nwith so many rhinos in\nsuch a small place, many\nhave been reintroduced\nto previous areas of their\nrange. Their status on the\nInternational Union for the\nConservation of Nature\n(IUCN) Red List has also\nbeen down-listed to Near\nThreatened, and, despite\nthis, population efforts\nremain ongoing in order\nto safeguard the rhinos\nfor the future in light of\nillegal ivory poaching.\nThese efforts are in need\nof worthy celebrations,\nbut this message \u2013 that\nrhino conservation is\nworking \u2013 is difficult to\nportray to individuals.\nIt may come of a\nsurprise to you, but there\nare three smaller rhino\nspecies living within Asia,\naside from the two in\nAfrica. The Sumatran rhinoceros is the only living\nrhino species left which\nis woolly; most people\nwould have thought that\nthe last of these died out\nat the end of the last ice\nage but in fact, they are\nclinging on in south-east\nAsia. They are now listed\nas Critically Endangered,\nwith only five substantial\npopulations remaining in\nthe wild: four on Sumatra\nand one on Borneo. Their\nrainforest homes have\nslowly been reduced as\nhumans have expanded\nagriculture and cities in\nthe previous range of the\nspecies. Their numbers\nare a lot more difficult\nto determine, as they are\nsolitary animals which are\nwidely scattered throughout their range \u2013 however,\nthere are estimates that\nfewer than 100 animals\nremain. This species\nrepresents a group with\nno other living members:\nthe woolly rhinos. When\nthey become extinct, will\nwe see the same media\noutcry? We are starting\ndown the slippery slope\nto extinction, and now\nis the time to act, before\nthey too are just another\ncasualty of the Anthropocene.\nThe southern white rhino is doing well thanks to conservation efforts// Wikimedia\nConnect with conservation \u2013 the scandal of Sudan\nLet\u2019s talk about sex(ual health)\nT\nhey say your\nyears at university are some of\nthe best of your\nlife. That the lessons you\nwill learn and the experiences you will gain will\nbe paramount in forming\nwho you are as a person.\nHowever, it does not\nalways feel that way. For\nmany of us the transition\nfrom the shelter of our\nhomes to the whirlwind\nthat is university can be\noverwhelming, and adjusting to this newfound\nindependence can feel\nlike a continuous struggle.\nAll too often we end up\nneglecting to take care of\nourselves (we\u2019ve all had\nthat sad bowl of cereal\nfor dinner, right?). Even if\nyou do happen to be one\nof those super humans\nwho find the time to study,\neat healthily, exercise,\nand maintain a social life,\nthere is still one aspect of\nour health that is greatly\noverlooked: our sexual\nhealth.\nWhy is Sexual Health\nImportant?\nUniversity is a time of\nfirsts, with many students\nfinding themselves\nsexually as well as aca-demically. Being aware of\nour bodies is an integral\npart of maintaining\nhonest, healthy, and ultimately satisfying sexual\nrelationships. We believe\nthat raising awareness on\nthis issue and providing\nstudents with the correct\ntools can help to facilitate\nthis, making everyone\nhealthier and happier!\nThat is why the Sexual\nHealth Campaign team\nconducted a survey of 155\nImperial students in which\n70% of participants expressed interest in having\na sexual health campaign\nand testing services.\nThe Campaign\nThe Sexual Health\nCampaign at Imperial is a\nnew student-led campaign\nthat was started by two\npostgraduates in the\nSchool of Public Health; it\nnow has student members\nfrom across the university,\nand collaborated with the\nUnion to empower and\neducate about sex.\nWe have partnered\nwith local sexual health\nclinics to provide full\nsexual health check-ups\nfor students, as well as\nlaunching an awareness\ncampaign to promote safe,\nconsensual sex for all.\nHow you can get involved\nOur campaign days are\nopen to undergraduate and\npostgraduate students on\nthree Wednesdays: May\n9th\n: (South Kensington),\n16th\n(Charing Cross) and\n23rd\n(South Kensington)\nfrom 11am to 4pm.\nDrop by, we would love\nto help answer any questions you may have about\nthe health check-ups, the\ncampaign, or just about\nsafe sex. In addition,\nthe Jefferiss Wing at St.\nMary\u2019s Hospital will\nprovide take-home testing\nkits ready to pick up\nthroughout May.\nHope to see many of\nyou there, in order to show\nImperial how important\nis sexual health for the\nstudent community!\nSCIENCE\nNada Mohamed-Ali\nHarumi Quezada\nYamamoto\nClara Greiner\nScience Writers\n\n"

This\nneophiliac mentality was\nwhat drove me to choose\nHumanities, Philosophy\nand Law (HPL) and\nComputational Medicine\nas my BSc options \u2013 basically anything that wasn\u2019t\nclinical Medicine. Of\ncourse, taking risks like\nthese could end up either\nway \u2013 through HPL, I\u2019ve\ndiscovered a new passion\nfor the arts whereas\nthrough Computational\nMedicine, I\u2019ve discovered\nmy pathological inability\nto write working code and\na near fatal allergy to da-ta-frames. Nevertheless,\nI was hoping that this\nconference would be the\nperfect end to my year of\nexperimenting, and the\nevent was finally sold to\nme under the promise\nof free food and Dame\nDarcey Bussell DBE of\nStrictly Come Dancing\nfame.\nThen April 19th\nrolled\naround and, on the most\nglorious day of the year\nso far, the decision to\nspend the whole day\nindoors being lectured\nat didn\u2019t seem like such\na great idea anymore.\nNevertheless, we dutifully\ntrooped in, fixing our\nswanky PRESS \u2013 Imperial\nCollege London badges to\nour chests and strapped\nourselves in for the eight-hour education tour-de-force.\nAfter a rousing opening\nspeech by science writer\nand broadcaster, Vivienne\nParry OBE, the main\nquestions of the day were\nposed:\n\u201cWhat is the role of\nan artist in 21st\ncentury\nsociety and how can one\nachieve artistic citizenship?\u201d and \u201cHow can art\nbe utilised to transform a\nnegative health image to a\npositive artistic one?\u201d\nCompelling questions\nfor sure, but not the ones\nI was seeking answers to.\nWhat I wanted to know\nwas when we\u2019d see the\nlegendary Dame Darcey\nBussell, principal dancer\nof the Royal Ballet at\nthe tender age of 20, and\nwhether or not she actually\nfloated, as rumours would\nhave you believe.\n\u201cDance for\nParkinson\u2019s\nshows dance\nas a positive\nintervention\nthat improves\nstability\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help\nbut notice an\nundercurrent\nof fear beneath\nthe positivity\u201d\nThe rest of the day\nwas split into showcases,\npanel discussions, and\nplenary activities with\norganisations explaining\ntheir projects and demonstrating various health\nbenefits. These projects\nranged from Melodies\nfor Mums, group singing\nsessions showing promising signs of preventing\nand abating post-natal de-pression, to The Reader,\nshared-reading groups\nattempting to tackle increasing social isolation\nacross the country. A\npersonal favourite was\nDance for Parkinson\u2019s,\na collaboration with the\nEnglish National Ballet,\nwhose promotional video\nwas a giddying montage\nof elderly chair-dancing\nand asymmetric legwear\nsported by the ballet\ntroupe. Not only is dance\na positive intervention\nthat improves posture,\nstability, and fluidity\nof movement, but one\npatient also described its\nbenefits as \u201ca new sense\nof freedom, a coping\nmechanism\u201d.\nOn the clinician side\nof the health experience,\nprojects such as Performing Medicine by the Clod\nEnsemble attempted to\nteach health workers and\nmedical students how\nto act human again \u2013 a\nregrettably much-needed\nprogramme in the current\nclinical environment. As a\nmedical student myself, I\nam often wary of accusations that new generations\nof health workers were\nincreasingly cold and\ndistanced from the people\nthey were trying to treat.\nHowever, as one speaker\nput it, \u201cFeeling caring\nisn\u2019t enough\u201d. Blame it on\nthe prescriptive nature of\nthe clinical encounter, the\ntick-box feel of ICE-ing\n(asking about ideas,\nconcerns, and expecta-tions), or time constraints\nimposed on health\nworkers, but the actual\ndemonstration of caring\nis now often left as an\nafterthought, regardless\nof how clinicians actually\nfeel.\nMidway through the\nday, we were treated to a\nworkshop with Patsy Rodenburg, Professor of Text\nand Poetry, and world\nexpert on teaching voice,\nspeech, and presentation\nskills. What started as a\ndescription of the power\nof \u2018presence\u2019 for healing\nand everyday life culminated in a cultish session\nof breathing exercises and\npair-bonding activities.\nDespite the atmosphere\nof religious reverence,\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel\na little sceptical of the\npromised benefits of\nbreathing to people (not\nbeyond, and not before).\nPerhaps it was because\nof my sceptical nature, I\ncouldn\u2019t help but notice\nan undercurrent of fear\nbeneath the praise and\npositivity throughout the\nday. Fear for funding,\nunderstandably, but also\na fear of the medical\ncommunity. The question\nmost often raised was how\nto do an RCT (randomised\ncontrol trial) and every\nmention of the initialism\nsent shiver through the\ncrowds. This, along with\nthe collective eye-rolling\nat the mention of evi-dence-based medicine left\nme slightly worried about\nthe medicine-arts divide.\nWas the rift really that ir-reconcilable? And whose\njob was it to bring these\ntwo disciplines together?\nIn this event, it felt like\na battle for dominance\nbetween science and\nart \u2013 social interventions\nwere declared \u201cbetter than\ndrugs\u201d and social health\nwas emphasised while biological health was often\nside-lined. I don\u2019t wish to\ndetract from the importance of social aspects of\nhealth, and these projects\nare all genuinely exciting\nregardless of what domain\nyou work in, but what\nwas needed \u2013 a common\nlanguage translating\nbetween arts and science,\nbetween \u2018soft\u2019 therapies\nand clinical outcomes \u2013\nwas sorely lacking from\nan event that sought to\nmarry the two worlds.\nWe left slightly early\nto catch the last ray of\nsummer sun. After all, I\ndidn\u2019t want to wait another\nyear before it graced us\nagain with its presence.\nUnfortunately, this meant\nI never got to see Darcey\nBussell, patron of fourteen\ncharities and committed\ndance advocate. Maybe\nI\u2019ll never know if her skin\nreally glows in the dark, as\nit does in my imagination,\nor whether she chooses\nto enter every room with\na pirouette. Either way, I\nwas glad I decided to go,\nif only to see the asymmetric legwear.\nThe arts can play a vital role in healthcare // Tas Kyprianou\n\n"
