FIRE IN SOUTHSIDB\nWith a crowd of sightseers on the staircase and landing, a fire in a Falmouth Hall room. was;\nsuccessfully extinguished last Thursday lunch-time. The door was, broken\nwith a fire extinguisher being used as a battering ram, and the flames were soon\ndoused. The smoke: and fire gone, several enthusiastic firefighters entered the room,\n, and began to dispose of furniture and other articles through the window. The panic was\nsomewhat comic, and the situation was worsened by the presence of rubbernecking bystanders oh the stairs, and the lack of any idea of procedure or drill. In addition, one of the fire hoses was spraying as much water over the staircase through leaks as\nactually reached the nozzle.

    "content": "FELIX\nHUMAN RIGHTS\nYEAR\nIs it relevant to IC?\nOn December 10th,1948, the\nGeneral Assembly of the United\nNations adopted and proclaimed\nthe universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights. The declaration\nsets out in thirty articles the\nrights to which all human beings\nare entitled and also states that\ntogether with rights go responsibility. Twenty years later, this\ndocument, although of fundamental significance, is virtually\nunknown to the general public\nand at government level, action\ndirected at realisation of these\nrights is slow to take place. Thus\nthe General Assembly of the\nU.N. designated 1968, International Year of Human Rights.\nAll countries have been asked to\nundertake special programmes of\neducation and action for Huraan\nRights Year. The main aims of\nthe U.K. Committee for Human\nRights Year are those of educating people about human rights\nand drawing attention to the lack\nof them in certain aspects of life\nin this country.\nBritain\nPerhaps you are wondering\nwhy we in Britain should concern\nourselves with human rights?\nUnless you fail to get a job because of your sex or colour, or\nyou are illegitimate, or you live\nin a slum area, you will probably\nthink that there is no violation of\nhuman rights in Britain. Yet the\nDeclaration states that everyone\nis entitled to the rights therein\nwithout distinction of any kind\nsuch as race, colour, sex etc. Another states that everyone is entitled to a decent standard of\nliving. Even in Britain, in 1968,\nthere is a great deal to be done in\nthe field of human rights.\nOverseas\nWhat is the situation in the rest\nof the world with regard to human rights? It is not generally\nrealised that some people are still\nheld in slavery at present time.\nCertainly, the majority of the\nworld's people do not have an\nadequate standard of living and\nfor many, the rights to education\nand to political and religious freedoms are meaningless. Even if we\nin Britain never suffered any infringement of our human rights,\nas laid down in the Declaration,\nthere would still be cause for\nconcern. For with the realisation\nof our rights, goes the responsibility to those who are still de-priv ed. At a time when Britain is\nfacing an economic crisis, it may\nseem inappropriate to be concerned with the plight of the rest\nof the world. It should be re-membered, however, that during\nthe squeeze and freeze and even\nsince devaluation the majority of\npeople in this country have been\nenjoying a better standard of living and more freedoms and pleasures than most other people in\nthe world.\nThus it is that Human F'<?h ts Year exists and is not without\nsupporters at IC. All the social\nclubs have expressed interest in a campaign at college and the majority have been active in forming\nan HRY committee and banning\nits programme. Tho ...mpa ign was inaugurated at the end of last\nterm. We hope that during this\nterm it will gather momentum,\nculminating in a HRY exhibition\nin March. Some of the Social\nClubs have included meetings\nwith special relevance to HRY in\ntheir programmes and all the\nmember clubs of the committee\nwill be participating in a Teachin on Human Rights on February\nthe first. Eminent speakers will\nbe defending the concept of human rights in Islam, Judaism,\nMarxism and Apartheid.\nIn addition to public ising the\nlack of human rights in many\nareas of the world (including\nBritain) the committee hopes to\nraise money for organisations that\nare committed to helping those\nwhose rights are being violated.\nDonations\nAlready, the Chinese Society has\noffered the profits from its New\nYear celebrations to the commit-tee. Another most encouraging\noffer has come unsolicited from\na mines undergraduate. He and\nhis family are giving a sum of\nmoney to HRY charities instead\nof spending it on Christmas and\nBirthday presents for'one another.\nThe committee would be delighted\nto hear of similar offers from\nother IC students. We are also\nsupporting the renewed efforts of\nthe ICSASAF organisers.\nProspects\nHere, I have merely outlined\nwhat is behind the HRY campaign and the possibilities for\naction\u2014its success as always depends on general student participation. If, as the editor suggested\nin the last issue, students are not\nintrinsically apathetic, then perhaps we can hope for a successful\ncampaign. But, you may say, he\nalso mentioned the need to offer\nsomething that is relevant to the\naverage student. Is Human Rights\nYear relevant?\nStudent\nInvolvement\nWe believe it is, because\nwhether we like it or not, having\na university education makes us a privileged class. We will probably not suffer many violations of\nour rights, though neither may we\nboast of winning the battle for\nthem. Ours could be the role of\nhelping others realise their human rights and 1968 at IC is the\ntime and place to begin.\nPlease send suggestions or\noffers of assistance to the secretary HRY committee via the\nUnion Rack.\nJOAN RUDDOCK\nBUGS BUG WELLS SOC Wells Soc.'s first meeting this\nterm was packed out to hear Dr.\nJ. H. Humphrey, F.R.S., speak\non \"Biological Warfare\" or\n\" Public Health in Reverse \" as it\nhas been described. Two years\nago a speaker from Porton Down\nwas banned from speaking at the\nlast minute as he held \" classified\ninformation,\" but this term's speaker suffered from no such\nhandicap.\nProblems\nThose w lio turned up at the\nmeeting hoping for lurid accounts\nof \"the Doomsday Bug\" and\ngerm gums a la Molesworth must\nhave been disappointed. Dr.\nHumphrey did not see biological\nwarfare in its present state of development as a terrifying threat\nto mankind. Many problems have\nto be overcome before microbes\ncan be used effectively as wea-pons, including those of spreading the organisms. Obviously\nsuch things as mosquitos, sand-flies or fleas cannot be used as\nthese cannot be trained to bite the\nright man.\nResearch\nPerhaps the greatest problem is\nto estimate beforehand the effect\nof a biological attack. Experiments are done on animals but\nthere is no way of extrapolating\nthe result to people, although apparently there are some who\nvolunteer to be experimented on.\nAccording to the speaker whenever there is an accidental infection in one of the research establishments it is of great importance\nto scientific research.\nLegality\nIf all the problems could be\novercome, biological warfare\nwould have some great advantages, like its great potency and\nability to kill without destroying\nproperty. On the legal aspect the\nUN has prohibited the first use of\n\" poisonous and obnoxious sub-stances\" and germ warfare. However, there is no restriction on\npossession of biological weapons\nand their use in retaliation. In Dr.\nHumphrey's opinion, biological\nwarfare was more likely to be\nprevented by the sheer number of\nproblems involved in using it.\nANN WHEATLEY\nGRAY BLOWS\nHUM PHS TRUMPET\nI find it difficult to write an\narticle on the current set of lectures by Humphrey Lyttleton.\nThis is not because the lectures are\nin any way poor, indeed they are\nextremely entertaining but he\nconfines himself to description\nand stops short of expressing any\nsort of opinion on the i a zz scene\nin general, or in particular for\nthat matter. It is like writing an\narticle on yesterday's Maths lec-ture.\nIt was something of are vela tion, therefore to hear him talking\nover lunch before his second lec-ture. He was remarking that it\nwas necessary to have reached a certain level of technical prowess\non an instrument before one\ncould experiment legitimately. I asked him if he thought that the\navant-garde players today had\nthis prowess and he agreed that\nmost of them had.\nHe also remarked that modern\njazz was tending to reach back\ninto jazz traditions and re-emerge\nin a new form (reminiscent of the\nHegel's dialectic materialism)\nJohn Coltrane, he said, was just at\nthe breakthrough point when he\ndied, and Archie Shepp and\nRollins are almost at that point\nnow.\nI find this an exciting concept,\ncertainly the avant-garde has\ncome in for a lot of emotional\nrather than rational criticism and\nto a certain extent this is under-stand able. One would be most\nupset and annoyed if a lecturer\nspent an hour or more in front of\nhis audience setting up a demon-st ration, and this is on fact what\nmodern jazz musicians are doing.\nThey are trying to find their feet\nand build a solid platform.\nHow does one conclude an\narticle of this soft? Unfortunately\nI cannot pick up my own trumpet\nand blow it like Humph, so I can only recommend that you go\nto his lectures.\nJOHN T. GRAY\nBARROW\nWith the advent of a new term,\nthe General i Studies Committee\nbroke away from the set pattern\nof formal lectures and question-and-answer sessions by inviting\nthe Barrow Poets to perform at\ncollege. The group enlivened the\nnormally overlong Tuesday lunch\nhours of the first two weeks with\ntheir refreshing approach to literature and music where the parody,\nthe oriental and the just plain offbeat seem to merge to produce\nentertainment of the first order. Their second performance, to\nPOETS\na packed Union Lower Lounge,\nwas especially characterized by\nits easygoing informality. The\nblend of the violin with a homemade double-bass-cum-cymbals-cum-drum contraption and a woodwind instrument with a modified tin funnel lent a refined\nidiocy to their songs and their\nchoice of poetry was calculated\nto send a student audience into\nraptures, which it did. It must not\nbe long before the Barrow Poets\nare invited to return\nPAUL HEATH\nThe Barrow Poets' most popular item in their Lower Lounge\nMBion was this poem by Roger McGough, reprinted by kind permission of Penguin Books and the poet\nAt Lunchtime-A Story of Love\nWhen the bus stopped to avoid\ndamaging a mother and child in the road, the\nyoung lady in the green hat sitting opposite\nwas thrown across me, and not being one to\nmiss an opportunity i started to make love with all my body.\nAt first she resisted saying that it\nwas too early in the morning and too soon after breakfast and that anyway she found\nme repulsive. But when i explained that\nthis being a nuclear age, the world was going\nto end at lunchtime, she took off her\ngreen hat, put her bus ticket in her pocket\nand joined the exercise.\nThe bus people, and there were many of\nthem, were shocked and surprised and amused-and annoyed, but when the word got around\nthat the world was coming to an end at lunch-time, they put their pride in their pockets\nwith their bms tickets and made love one with\nthe other. And even the bus conduct er, being\nover, climbed into the cab and struck up\nsome sort of relationship with the driver.\nThatnight, on the bus coming home,\nwe were all a little embarrassed, especially me\nand the young lady in the green hat, and we\nall started to say in different ways how hasty and foolish we had been. Butthen, always\nhaving been a bit of al ad,i stood up and\nsaid it was a pity that the world didn't nearly\nend every lunchtime and that we could always\npretend. And then it happened . . .\nQuick asa crash we all changed partners\nand soon the bus was a quiver with white\nmothball bodies doing naughty things.\nAnd the next day\nAnd everyday\nIn every bus In every street In every town In every country people pretended that the world was coming\nto an end at lunchtime. It still hasn't. Although ina way it has.\nROGER McGOUGH\n\n"

In the form of a question\nforum, it was organised by the\nLondon colleges in the U.N. student assembly and the I.R.C. who, in conjunction with the IC\nnationalistic societies, run the IC\nbranch of the U.N.S. A., acted as\nhosts.\nBR BEST\nMr. G.F. G. Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, formerly chairman\nof the Eastern Railways Board\nand General Manager of the\nEastern Region of British Rail\nhad \"much to say\" at his General\nStudies Talk on the first Thursday\nof term.\nBad freight\nNot surprisingly, his talk was\nconcerned with the history of\nBritish Rail and a survey of the\ndevelopments in the post-war\nyears of the rail system. He\nclaimed that Britain led the world\nin rail passenger transport because even though other countries\nwere individually more punctual,\nfaster, more frequent or more\neconomic in their services, when\nall these factors and several more\nwere taken into account, we were\nundoubtedly in the forefront.\nUnfortunately the same was not\ntrue of freight traffic as a comprehensive policy for freight had\nnever been formulated, unlike for\npassenger transport where things\nhad been very carefully planned.\nGovernment\nslammed\nMr. Fiennes also slammed successive governments for not allowing the Minister of Transport\ninto the Cabinet until the mid\n1950's when transport accounted\nfor nearly a quarter of our Gross\nNational Product. He also criticised the policy of never appointing a minister with previous experience of transport.\nATTACKED\nNothing wrong\nwith UN\n\" There is nothing wrong with\nthe U.N., just its members,\" was\none of the provocative remarks\nmade by Lord Caradon during his\nvery short introduction. Given to\nstimulate questions, unnecessarily\nas it happened, it included a definition of the U.N. as a forum\nfor discussion where all notions\nmay be heard equally (at the\nGeneral Assembly), a place where\nrepresentatives of all nations can\neasily contact each other (especially where no formal diplomatic\nrelations exist), a machine for\nhelping the world's problems (its\nvarious agencies, e.g.. World\nHealth Organisation) and an instrument for peace (via the Security Council).\nGreat powers\nQuestions on reform ranged\nfrom the promise to the U.N. of\nthe necessary \" teeth \" to enforce\nits ruling to the question of\nwhether it was right for the\n\" Great Powers \" to have special\nprivileges in the Security Council.\nAll speakers seemed to agree that\nwhile in theory all nations should\nhave the same say, in practice,\nthose who would have to pay for\nor otherwise implement would\nnaturally have a veto by unilateral action anyway and hence\nthe practical impossibility of\ne quli ty of nations in this sphere.\nMany Africans\nWith the large proportion of\nAfrican students present it was\ninevitable that Rhodesia would be\nmuch discussed. This was indeed\nthe case though nothing emerged\nin addition to the newspaper reports over the past twenty-seven\nmonths. Eventually the chair\nca ii eda halt to the Rhodesia discussion to allow other topics to be\nbrought in.\nThese included Cyprus, the\nArab-Israeli war and its aftermath and the position of the U.N. and the Chinese Peoples Republic. This last was perhaps particularly enlightening as the three\npossible alternatives are : to continue as at present with Nationalist China, to exchange Nationalist for Communist, or to have\nboth.\nThe U.N. charter, which necessitates the winning of general support by major powers for their\nschemes, also allows its members\nto decide which choice they want.\nThe problem is not then the\nU.N., but the members of the\nU.N.( Duott? of tl je Jforftugljt\nPete Ruhemann\u2014Let's Back Britain and volunteer to work an\nextra half hour in exams.\nDr Curzon (Physics lecturer in Statistical Mechanics)\u2014In nature\nan attraction at long ranges often leads to a repulsion over short\ndistances.\nChairman of academic sub-committee at Guilds Exec*\u2014Education, or anything stupid like that.\nEls DaIs lala Is la13 Eat at the only Thai restaurant in Europe Phone 01-584 8529 [0\njg BANGKOK RESTAURANT Sjj 14 BUTE STREET, SOUTH KENSINGTON, S.W.7| jj All food home cooked Thai food a speciality\nOpen 11.30 a.m. \u20143.00 p.m.;5.30 p.m. \u201411,00 p.m. Closed Monday\nSTOMP BOARD WASHERS WHAT'S ON\nIS\nmm13 WEDNESDAY24 JANUARY Photographic Soc.

At the recent RCC\nmeeting the meeting was informed\nthat of the \u00a3100 allocated to the\nclub in order to finance concerts\nfor the year all this money and\n\u00a325 more had been spent on the\nfour concerts last term i.e. \u00a331\nper concert! Permission was\ngiven to transfer something of the\norder of \u00a330 from their advertising grant to help pay for the\nconcerts. A further \u00a340 was requested and given to finance\nfuture dances.\nHow is it that every other club\nmanages to run concerts and\ndances at a profit and yet the\nJazz club calmly expects to lose\n\u00a330 plus each time? Their ad-Reply by Steve Mollinson,\nChairman of R.C. C. The Jazz Club was originally\nallocated \u00a315 for sub sidi sing con-cert s, they in fact spent \u00a348 due\nto poor attendances, and anticipated another \u00a37 for outstanding\nitems. The other \u00a345 was spent\non advertising, including a bulk\norder for posters. They requested \u00a340 to cover their losses\nand were granted this. They also\nrequested up to \u00a340 for another\ntwo dances, this figure to include\nthe advertising for these dances\nwhich were aimed to break even\nand sc the ensuing \u00a335 of their\nadvertising grant would not be\nused. Neither myself nor the\nFhe house will have only background central heating, but there\nwill be gas or electric fires run\nthrough coin-in-the-slot meters.\nCleaners will come in daily to\ndean the common living areas,\nbut the tidiness of the bedrooms\nwill be the occupant's responsibility. The house will have\nkitchens alongside the common\nrooms, but lazy residents will\nhave to come to the campus if\nthey want their food made for\nthem.\nThe rents will be between\n\u00a32 10s. and \u00a33 10s. so the student\nhouses will be more expensive\nthan the Halls of Residence from\nwhich they will be financially in dependent. The house will be\nsea supporting down to the last\ndetail.\nThe house will be run by stu-dents; Dave Harris, secretary of\nICU, will be the first warden.\nThe conditions of the lease are\nfairly restricting so while a student\nhouse will be freer than a Hail\nof Residence it will not be as free\nas a flat. It is envisaged that about\n50 per cent of the residents will\nbe post-graduates as they will use\nthe house for a greater part of the\nyear than an under-graduate and\nso enable the rents to be kept at\nan acceptable level.\nThisfirststudent house will be\nopened around the end of June,\nbut by then it is hoped that several other houses will have been\nleased so that by Easter 1969\nthere may be as many as a thousand places in Hall and student\nhouses. The success of the\nscheme depends entirely on the\nresidents themselves as it has to\nbe proved that students are capable of running their own houses.\nvert ising seems to be badly at\nfault, the fact that the advertising money will now be spent on\nhiring groups adds weight to this\nargument. Another strange\npoint is that it is prepared to have\na concert during the vacation. In\nreply to the question \"won't everybody be on holiday?\" it was\nsaid \" Well, people know it's on\nand they can come if they want\nto.\" I doubt if people will know\nif it's on and the majority of students will not be able to attend\nanyway.\nAll this seems as can de lou s waste of money, these concerts\nseem to be merely a way for a few\nJazz club members to see the top\ngroups with union sub sidi sed tickets. Please, why is this allowed by the RCC?\nD.N. SWEETING\n(3rd Year Civil)\nPresident of the Jazz Club recall\nany suggestion of a concert during the vacation, and if it was\nsuggested permission was not\ngranted for it to be held.\nAlthough one of the functions\nof the Union is to sub sid is e minority interests, the type of interest and amount of subsidy being decided by students, it should\nbe pointed out that the two\ndances were to be held on an experimental basis, if they first c jid not break even no more such\nfunctions would be held, as this\nwould indicate lack of general\nstudent interest, the feeling being\nthat we should not have to sub sid is e something like a jazz con-cert.\nRay Flippant leaned back in\nhis hide-bound chair and watched\nthe dark clouds gathering outside.\nFlippant always watched from the\nother side of the window.

In order to make the getting of discount\nmore efficient I would like to compile a list of establishments which\nwill give them. So next time you buy something (or eat or go to the\ntheatre) ask if they will give you anything off against your IC or ULU\ncard (for those in RCS who have yet to receive a ULU card . . .) and\nif they say yes let me know, c/o the FELIX ra^k in the Union.

This\nfe te should reduce the families of\nthe Kensington-Chelsea area to\npoverty by hook or by crook but\nwe still need more hook type\nideas.\nThe whole charity will be\nwound up at the final dance in the\nUnion the evening of the fe te with\nEric Burdon and the Animals\nwhich whilst not an enormous\nmoney maker should provide a successful conclusion to the\nactivities.\nEnts lose money on Money? Anyone who c \u00ab. ..plains tr w no big name groups come to IC\nwill be disappointed to hear that\nZoot Money played to a half-filled Concert Hall or: the first\nSaturday of term. The actual\nnumbers there will never be\nknown because of Ents. bungle\nover pickets, but the number was\ncertainly no more than for a normal hop. Even members of\nEats. admit that it was not a good dance, but hasten to add\nthat the show was good. Zoot\nMoney's act was described as\n\"entrancing\" and \"entertain-ing,\" The light show was good\nbut no doubt an IC electrician\ncould have done an equally professional job. Musically the show\nproduced a good integrated\nsound, but was not particularly\noutstanding. Obviously the\nwhole effect was lessened because\nof the small numbers. The\nblame for this must fall on the\nlack of publicity, which seems to\nbe due to the poster designer's many other activities.\nWhile it is not certain that the\nPlastic Fairytale has had its last\nwag, it seems that only pressure\nfrom the Council will get it going\nthis term. No sympathy can be\nextended to those who have paid\ntheir membership, as while there\nwere almost 130 members, less\nthan 75 people arrived to the last\nFairytale of last term. Such an\nattendance is very unrewarding\nfor the members of Ents, who put\nin such a lot of effort in an attempt to make it a success. The\nlem and was just not there and\nhat is the end of it.\nEnts. generally seems to be a little unsettled, with clashes between Chairman, Keith Guy, and\nhis main officers. Their main\ncomplaint is that he does not\nheed their wishes and organises\nthings without consulting them.\nThis he strongly denies, and to\nprove his point allowed himself to\nbe outvoted over a motion he\nwanted to lay before Council in\nwhich an Entertainments Club\nCommittee would be set up to coordinate Ents., Dramsoc. and\nother entertainment societies. It\nwas, however, suggested that\nthere should be an informal committee set up to avoid clashes of\nthese clubs.\nPlastic effort\nredirected\nWe can look forward to\nbrighter hops (or dances as they\nare now being called), as all the\neffort that went into the Plastic.\nFairytale can now be redirected.\nOn Saturday the dance will feature the Marmalade, and a light\nand film show is being organised\nin co-operation with Dramsoc.\nThe present scene may be chang-ing, but IC Ents aim to keep up\nwith it,\nJOHN SOMMER\nPOOR YEAR FOR ICSASAF\n\"\u00a380 derisory\"\nIC.SASAF was originally set up to raise some \u00a32,000. Thirteen\nmonths later it has so tar collected \u00a380. The original intention of\nICSASAF\u2014or to give it its full title, \" The Imperial College South\nAfrican Appeal Fund \"\u2014was to rai a a money to ena b!e a coloured\nSouth African student ta take a three-year course at IC. This fund\nwas overwhelmingly approved by one of the few quo rate Union meetings within living memory, and two organisers were appointed, Andy\nJordan, now a prominent member of Council, and Mike Bell\nchambers. The high ideals of that Union meeting seem to have\nfallen rather flat\u2014so what went wrong ?\nAs planned, last summer term ICSASAF sent out 3,600 letters\nto Union members in which it appealed for donations. The response\nwas a steady trickle, rather than a flood, of letters, bringing in the\ntotal of \u00a380. No other means of raising money have yet been tried\nbeyond an un succesful attempt to adopt ICSASAF as this year's Carnival charity. \" The amount collected reflects poorly on the\norganisers; it's a derisory sum,\" said Andy Jordan. He also agreed\nthat the original idea had been idealistic to awaken much response\nin a Union to 8 8\nDec.\nDec.\n2\n9\nDec. 16\nFootball Pools Winners\n7 Goals \u00a35\u2014R.

Mannon. Physics 2, via Physics letter\nrack.\nHe added, \" we expected\nmore.\" It was calculated at the\nhistoric union meeting which begat ICSASAF, that if every union\nmember contributed 10/-, the required \u00a32,000 would be quickly\nraised. Few eyebrows were raised\nat this statement, and a somewhat\nsmug union joyously and overwhelmingly accepted its implications and approved ICSASAF.\nIn retrospect it seems surprising,\neven more so when one considers\nthat I.C.'s fund-raising instincts\nwere already directed towards the\nCarnival charity. The next time\nI.C.U. gets a chance to pass a motion it should perhaps consider\nits issues more deeply. It is also\nsurprising that a lot more has not\nbeen done to raise money for-ICSASAF.\nFor the present two steps are\ngoing to be made to all members\nof l.C. staff, and second, approaches to firms connected with\nI.C. are planned. It seems hardly\nlikely at the moment that anything approaching \u00a32,000 will be\nraised by these means. Assuming this, some decision should be\ntaken soon as to the destination\nof the money already donated,\nand which is slowly gathering interest in the bank. Whatever\nhappens, the organisers are determined it should go towards bringing a coloured student to Britain.\nMight it go to a parallel scheme\nsuch as LSESASAF or another,\nUCSASAF? This is possible,\nbut could raise legal complications. Might the fund be taken\nover by a keen union member,\nprepared to devote a lot of time\nand effort towards raising as\nmuch as possible ? If someone\nwith a good business sense is prepared to do the job, Andy Jordan\nwould be very willing to let it go.\nThe final decision rests with the\nUnion, one hopes it will consider\ncarefully the issues it so lightly\nbrought into being last year.\nIf ICSASAF is given a fresh\nlease of life as I feel it should be,\nit should be put on a firmer basis,\nwith a much larger group of\npeople working for it\u2014if this is\npossible. Two organisers, already\nsomewhat involved in union activities, are not enough. It should\nattempt to raise money in as\nmany ways as possible, not\nsimply by duplicated letters of\nappeal. For instance, it could\nrun a hop and (taking, the long-term view) print Christmas cards,\nit could organise more person-to-person collections. (It should incidentally publicise its aims more\nfully. One I.C. student commented on ICSASAF, \"Oh, it's about aeroplanes, isn't it ?\") It\nshould be more forthright in rattling tins. ICSASAF is scared of\ncompeting with Carnival\u2014but if\nit is to raise its \u00a32,000 it must, to\nan extent. It is, after all, a union-backed fund. What it needs are\nlarge quantities of enthusiasm,\nhard work, and ideas. If these\nquantities are not forthcoming the\nmoney collected so far should go\nas quickly as possible to a parallel fund.\n(For all those who want to resuscitate ICSASAF, the person to\nsee is Andy Jordan, Chemical\nEngineering 3, or Mike Bellchambers Weeks 64, Mechanical\nEngineering 2).\nJOHN MULLALY.\n\n"

Davies.\nParking meters began to operate from January 15th in Exhibition Road and Prince Consort Road and in other roads near the\nCollege lying within the boundaries of the Westminster City Council;\nand it is expected that meters in the other public roads near the College, lying within the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will be\noperating by about June.\nThe College will have parking space for about 400 cars within its\nprecincts but this number is barely one half of the number of cars\nbelonging to College people and at present normally parked during\nthe day-time in and around the College. A division of the available\nplaces between teaching and other staff, and students,' has been\nmade, and Heads of Departments have allocated the places given to\ntheir Department, taking account of need and on the basis that\nteaching staff and other staff should have equal numbers. The\nImperial College Union has allocated the student share of the places.\nThe Parking and Traffic Commitee has been reconstituted, under\nthe chairmanship of Mr. A. Stephenson, with representatives from the\nI.C. Union, The Association of University Teachers, the Trade Unions\nand the Administration, and Professor Buchanan has kindly agreed to\njoin the Committee. The Committee has the power to consult any\nperson within the Collese, for help or advice, as and when required.\nThe Committee will keep under constant review the problems of\ntraffic and parking and the method of allocating parking places; and\nwill advise the Rector.\nRepresentatives of the Trade Unions met the Rector just before\nChristmas and discussed with him several of the problems arising\nfrom the shortage of parking accommodation as it affected their\nmembers. In particular, they said that in their opinion it would be\npossible to manage the parking arrangements without involving the\nCollege in additional expense. The Rector agreed that there should\nbe a trial period when no charge should be made to anybody allocated\na parking sticker but said that if experience proved that the College\ncould not control the parking without spending additional money,\ncharges would have to be made. The Trade Union representatives\nagreed to this.\nThe College parking problems will not reach their peak until\nthe College assembles for the new Session in October, by which time\nall of the public roads around the College will have parking meters\nin operation. The Parking and Traffic Committee will therefore have\ntime to see how the scheme is working and will have some factual\nevidence on which to base their recommendations. In the meantime,\nthe College is considering if there are any possibilities of increasing\nthe parking space within the College precincts.\nED.: Reaction to the news on\nparking charges has been favourable from all quarters. All now\nseems quiet between the empty\nwastes of Exhibition Road and\nPrince Consort Road and the\ncrowded meter less Queens Gate.\neye le security Patrick Haxell of the Chemistry Department has been commissioned to find out the extent\nof bicycle stealing in RCS.

In fact he\nhasn't eaten solid food since he\narrived here this term. We're all\nvery worried about him on staircase 2 lizard.\nStudy Studies\nHowever he informs us that the\nManagement Studies and Industrial Sociology course has just\nbeen launched. The lectures are\nat 4.30 p.m. on a Tuesday in\nMech Eng. The first was held\nyesterday. The lecturer is Miss\nWoodward and colleagues, and\nthey may hold tutorials and seminars later. This year the scheme\nis experimental and non exam in able; but if it proves successful it\nmay be introduced into third\nyear options later.\nIn the Maths department the\nundergraduate circular has almost\nbeen analysed and the results will\nbe given to the Senior Tutor within the next week or so.\nI would like to remind Physics\nand Chemistry students that staff\nstudent committee reports are\nposted on notice boards in their\ndepartments.\nCommandos\nAt the meeting of year reps\nheld last week several interesting\npoints were brought up.\nMike reminded the reps about\nhis commando squad of colle c tors, the idea is for people to give\ntheir names to Mike (via Physics)\nand then, say if rush hour trains\nare delayed, the squad would\nassemble, rush to the station,\nmingle with the crowd, without\nadding to the headaches of the\nstation master, and collect lots of\nmoney. This idea is a good way\nof increasing our large lead in the\namount of money collected.\nSmoking Concert\nAll those who have been to the\nsmoking concert in past years will\nknow all about the mixture of\nsketches and free beer that goes\nit make it a success. Not to mention the barrel of beer for the best\nsketch and a bottle of whiskey for\nthe best limerick.\nContributions to 78 Beit c/o Spooks or to Terry Fox c/o Zoology 2.\nColoured Bras\nDon't forget the Union Meeting\ntomorrow\u2014There's a report on\nFrank's motion and election of\nthe committee to help with this,\nas well as the first reading of the\nnew constitution which has been\nposted in the notice boards for a week or so.\nOne point coming from this\nwhich was discussed at the year\nrep's meeting last week is the system of awards given by the union\nand the possibility of giving an\naward other than a tie. Maria\nWallis suggested a Social Colours\nBra but Mike would rather see a pair of panties\u2014maybe he will\nhave a few examples for us.\nFinally. I'd like to tell you all\nthat Betty thanks Stew Barnes,\nwho wrote the last Mackmania,\nfor her mention and give a point\nto Andy Jordan\u2014he needs it!\nGENTLEMEN OF MINES I think everyone in Mines\nwould like to congratulate our\nEnts officer, Stan Greetham, on\nhis superb organisation of the\nMines Ball, held at the end of\nlast term. This was the first time that the event has been held in\nSouthside and Stan and his committee worked tremendously hard\nat their difficult task with the\nresult that this year's Mines Ball\nwill be remembered by all who\nattended.\nWhile gratefully acknowledging all the congratulations which\nhe has received since the occasion\nStan confessed that he too had\nsuch a good time that he cannot\nremember very much about the\nlater hours. However perhaps it\nis worth noting that the dice table\nmade a loss, for probably the first\ntime ever, largely due-to the fact\nthat an RCS underling was calling the wrong odds.\nMines 90 skating\nThe venue for this term's Mines Night has been fixed as\nQueens Club for ice skating. The\nJourney there will be via the\nBuilders Run, Churoh Street., and\nBayswater Road, with the alternative route for the more affluent\nbeing via Knightsbridge, Park\nLane and Bayswater Rd.\nIn a recent exclusive interview\nwith that master of the English\nlanguage and also Editor of RSM\nJournal, Barry Hood, the news\nleaked out that a bumper edition\nof the Journal can be expected\nthis year, with lots of articles and\npossibly even photographs. Howevr, perhaps the brightest news is\nthe possibility that the price will\nbe slashed by over a half, so that\npople will be induced to read\nRSMJ, thus boosting circulation\nto what could be an all time re-cord.\nIn the first week of this term\nMines held a film show, in aid of\nCarnival when two films, Gambit\nand The Outrage, were shown.\nDespite the fact that one of the\nfilms was rather poor, an entertaining evening was had by all,\nand Carnival profited by the sum\nof \u00a317. Another film show will\nbe held later in the term when the\nfilms should be undoubtedly\nspicier since they have been\nchosen by Vice-President Phil\nHopwood.\nMines Carnival effort is going\nvery strongly and since we already have over \u00a3500 collected\nthere is no reason why this year\nwe should not exceed our target\nof \u00a31,000. Our first term's collections put us far in front of\nGuilds and RCS in the amount\nraised per capita. For this term's effort a \"Collecting Week\" is\nplanned when it is hoped that\nMetallurgy, Geology and Mining\nand Min Tech will go out on\ndifferent nights, and a prize of a few crates will be awarded to the\ndepartment which collects most\ncash.\nBy now the much publicised\ntea and coffee machine should\nhave arrived and been installed in\nlevel 2, Min. Tech. dept. At present it seems that there are no ingredients for the machine so all\nyou thirsty Minesmen may have\nto wait a little longer before you\ncan get a drink out of licensing\nhours.\nOn Sunday 28th there will be\nan all star football match at Harlington when Mines play Guilds\nin the Technology Cup. Since\nGuilds have a very strong team\nthis year it is essential that Mines\nhave a lot of support so what\nbetter way of getting rid of your\nSunday hangover than standing\non the touch line and spurring the\nMines team to victory.\nGUILD SPOT First things first\u2014a belated\nNew Year Greeting to all\nGuildsmen. (Felix unaccountably failed to appear on New\nYear's Day.)\nMorphy Day Repeat\nAt the beginning of a new term,\nperhaps it would be useful to\nsketch in the major events of\ninterest to Guildsmen. If last\nterm was the term of non events\n(Morphy Day and the Swimming\nGala) this is the term of enter-tain ment s.( Though some have\nsuggested re-staging Morphy Day\non the Oxford-Cambridge Boat\nRace.)\nit's a Magical\nMystery Night\nOur Entertainments Committee\nhave already organised the Engineers' Dinner and Dance to be\nheld on Feb. 2nd and all is going\nsmoothly for a really superb evening for those lucky enough to get\na ticket. Next they have really\nlet their imagination run riot on\nthe greatest ever Carnival to be\norganised at I.C. \u2014in conjunction with R.S. M.( Really Stupid\nMugs?) arrangements are well\nunder way for the Magical\nMystery Night\u2014advance advertising is already starting so be\nready to buy tickets at the first\nopportunity.\nFollowing this tremendous\nnight out we have two \" sport\"\nevents: the first Guilds Soccer Sixes at Harlington, and\nthe annihilation of all opposition\nin the Bristol 24 hour Pedal Car\nRace by Guilds revolutionary GT\npedal cars. Music and Culture\nIn addition this term\nwe will be having at least a couple\nof Guilds Nights\u2014these will be\ngreat fun for all concerned and\ndetails will be released at our\nUnion Meeting on Thursday at\n1.15 pm in Mech Eng 220. This\nis perhaps the best Union Meeting\nof the year\u2014our contribution to\nthe General Studies Course\u2014our\nmost sophisticated and erudite\noccasion\u2014the Guilds Festival of\nMusic and Culture. All years will\nbe submitting scintillating items\nof entertainment in their quest\nfor the W.C trophy: certain\nother alcoholic prizes are also\navailable. We have not accepted\nDavid Frost's entry this year as\nits standard was not sufficiently\nhigh! Make sure your year has\nan entry and turn up for a really\ngreat entertainment.\nUnion Office\nMeanwhile the most important event of the term\nso far is that we have completed the major part of the furnishing of the Guilds Union Office\n\u2014it is now the smoothest student\noffice in any Union anywhere!\nThis project has taken nearly two\nyears to complete and during this\ntime the favourite occupation of\nthe occupants has been \" to count\nthe number of holes in the wall\ntoday.\" Everyone in Guilds is\nwelcome, to drop in at opening\nhours about anything at all\u2014\nideas, comments, suggestions\u2014\nand we open every lunchtime except Wednesdays.\nDon't forget: Union Meeting\nthis Thursday.\nVIETNAM\nAND THE ABUSE OF SCIENCE\nOn Thursday, 11th January, Dr. Stephen Rose of the Biochemistry Department, I.C., spoke to the International Relations Club\non Vietnam and the Abuse of Science. The talk was preceded by an\ninstructive and moving film from N. Vietnam about the war. This\ncontrasted sharply with the US propaganda put within easy reach of\nall of us AND turned out to be irrelevant to Dr. Rose's talk.\nDr. Rose began by alleging that the war in Vietnam was being\nwaged by the US as a largely experimental war in which many new\nchemicals and other weapons were being used for the first time. This,\nhe said, was immoral, internationally illegal and, in the long run,\nextremely dangerous to the world.\nChemical and biological weapons fall into 5 groups all of which\nwere made illegal in 1925 by the Geneva protocols. The US congress\nhowever refused to ratify them. Dr. Rose stated that the US admitted\nto the extensive use of defoliating agents in Vietnam. The claim by\nthe US defoliate rs that \"only we can stop forests\" does not adequately\nportray the power of this weapon. The US's stated aims in using\ndefoliating agents are to deprive the NLF of cover and starve them of\nfood by destroying crops. In accordance with the US's usual high\nmoral standard the \" innocent\" people of S. Vietnam are bombarded\nwith leaflets before every defoliating raid. However, since most\npeasants cannot read and anyway will not abandon their lives to go to\ndistant US held areas, they stay in their villages and take the consequences. Crops are destroyed ; women, children and old people die\nof malnutrition and the mobile Viet Cong escape easily.\nSome of the Herbicidal (defoliating) agents used contain arsenic\ncompounds and, according to re-ports, fish, poultry, buffalo and\nother animals die first.\nForests Destroyed\nDr. Rose went on to say, the immorality of the present effect of\nthese activities is unquestionable\nbut the hazards for the future are\nalso ominous. The upsetting of\nthe ecological balance resulting\nfrom destruction of forests \" half\nthe size of Montana\" will have\ngrave effects on future generations\nof any colour.\nBiological Weapons\nAt present the U.S. chemical\ncorps spends 400 Million Dollars\nper annum. Research is being'\nconducted on quite a large scale\nby various universities and corporations in the U.S., some of\nthese organisations are labelled\n\" food machinery \"-double think! Some \" workers \" at Fort Deitrich in the US were recently\npraised for producing an effective\nform of rice rust (this was reported by Dr. Humphrey at Wells\nSoc. the following Monday).\nDr. Rose stated that CBW\n(Chemical and Biological Warfare) weapons need not be stockpiled because many of them could\nbe produced cheaply and quickly\nwith simple apparatus and might\nbecome used extensively by small\ncountries. The U.S. have started\nto use a whole arena of new\nweapons in Vietnam and the door\nto their use must be firmly closed now before it is too late.\nConcerted action by scientists\ncould have some effect. CBW\nresearch must be declassified. In\nthis country in particular the\nmicro-biological warfare establishment at Porton Down should\nbe \" opened \" (also suggested by\nDr. Humphrey at Wells Soc.).\nLethal gases\nThe US admits to using non-lethal in capac it at or s but evidence\n(apart from the fact that 2 Australian soldiers died in \"non-lethal \" gas when wearing gas\nmasks) shows that some of the\ngases used are lethal if the dose\nexceeds l mg. per person. The\n\"non-lethal\" gases are commonly\nused to flush people out of hides\nto expose them to napalm and\nmachine guns. These operations\nillustrate very well how the US,\nby fragmenting information, exploits western methods of thought\nto the full so as to justify what\nthey do.\nSome of the gases used may indeed be non-lethal but when used\nin conjunction with machine guns\nthey form an intrinsic part of a killing machine. It is as misleading to talk about the effects\nof gas separately as it is to state\nthat the barrel of a gun is non-lethal. The credibility gap of the\nUS army is still further stretched\nwhen one realises that US troops\ncarry at rope ne( antidote to nerve\nMoral Onus\nThe onus to be moral seems to\nhave shifted from the physicist to\nthe chemist and biologist but the\nfragmentation of scientific disciplines must never be allowed to\nprevent any scientists and engineers from speaking out when they\nshould.\nThe responsibilities on the individuals concerned are heavy in\nthis case because the materials\ncan be produced quite easily with\nthe agreement of a much smaller\nnumber of people than was the\ncase with nuclear weapons*. Dr.\nRose said that it is terrible that\nthere is so little discussion or\nteaching at I.C. about the social\nand moral implications of what\nWE do.\nFootnotes\n1. A conference on BCW is* to\nbe held in London and will be\nopen to the public on the evening of Friday, February 23rd.2. Plans have been made for the\nformation of a study group to\nexamine the evidence and\nissues raised by Dr. Rose.\nPersons interested should contact Sam T.W. Secretary,\nI.R.C. PIERS CORBY N "

By\nthe end of this term an abundance of silver beverage con-tain ers, it is hoped, will be in\npossession of I.C.. The hockey, rugby and soccer\nclubs are still going strong in their\nrespective challenge competitions,\nall with good prospects of success.

The best performances have come from the second\nand third teams, both playing in\nDivision 3.

Except for one\nor two lapses the defence has\nplayed steadily, conceding considerably fewer goals than in the\nlast few years. However this has\nbeen more than offset by a complete inability to score goals. In\nfact, leaving out the 10-1 defeat\nof Westfieki, only eight goals\nwere scored in twelve games. Out\nof these only one was won and\nsix were drawn. The problem\nseems to be one of lack of ability\nto make good constructive movements midfield. On the brighter\nside the other XI's have been very\nsuccessful, with the standard of\nindividual play much higher than\nusual. The 2nd XI in particular\nis ha1 ing a good year, very well\ncaptained by Nieel Varian.\nSoccer Southampton University 3, IC 3\nIC's first match of this term entailed a long trip down to\nSouthampton where there had\nbeen no snow. After having\nbeaten Southampton University\n3\u20142 last term in London, I.C. were fairly confident of a second\nwin but as it turned out, they did\nnot quite succeed.\nThe conditions were not very\ngood, the ground being very hard\nand a little icy, I.C. adjusted their\ngame to the slippery surface almost immediately, realising that\nturning quickly with the ball was\nimpossible and that first-time\npassing was the only answer. This\nbrought two early goals to I.C., scored by Hopweod and Coldwell, before Southampton had\ngot into their stride.\nAfter these early goals, the I.C. onslaught quiet e ned down som-what and Southampton drew a goal back but only for Whittle to\nscore a third goal for I.C. In the second half the picture\nwas a little different with Southampton doing most of the attacking and I.C. only looking dangerous in occasional break-aways.\nHowever the I.C. defence seemed\nquite capable of handling the\nSouthampton attack until the last\n10 minutes when they scored two\ngoals to equalise.\nsews e Congratulations to ICWA Hockey\non reaching UL Final for the\nfirst time ever\nQuarter Final Report\nLast Wednesday ICWA attempted for the third time to get\ninto the semi-final of the ULU\ncup.

In fact the\nball entered the net four times but\none was above the goalkeeper's head and the Goldsmith's referee\nwould not allow it.
