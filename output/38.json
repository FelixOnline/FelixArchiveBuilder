    "content": "FELIX\nTHE BOSS An Interesting study for the Sociologist might be the effect of wartime evacuation on the present day lives of the youngsters to whom\nit applied. For instance, did a sudden impact with the countryside influence the adult personality of an otherwise London destined child? At a nearly age Kenneth Percy El c ridge was subjected to a complete change in environment. From the more fashionable of Northern London' s suburbs he found himself in the wide open spaces of South Africa, eventually spending five formative years at Par Jet own HighSchool, Johannesburg. Eldridge himself admits that if it had not been for this upheaval he would not now be reading engineering, nor would he play rugby football. To\nimagine him as anything but an engineer, or rug ger player is, indeed, difficult, so to this extent his life has been influenced. But in a wider field it is felt that his present makeup has been greatly formed as a result of this early travel. That Ken is' different' there is no doubt. A lack of conservation in his views, manner, and appearance for along time his favourite suiting has been pea green tweed has led him to be come an odd type of practical freethinker. Classification is difficult in his case, for he combines afresh, youthful personality, with an occasional cultural sophistication. In fact, at times the bespectacled shortsightedness, and pouting upper lip, suggests a tendency to supercilious ness. Contrasting these characteristics are those of a more than' average sportsman. In Imperial College perhaps he is best known as hooker of this season's successful rug ger XV, where he also made bin mark as a fast' spoiler', and first time tackier. Having gained half colours for athletics in his first year, he has since been able to write knowledgeable, if somewhat frivolous, reports on ' Sports Day'. Whilst claiming to spend a lot of his time swimming, it should be\nnoted that this is carried out well away from Kensington. Militarily, Corporal Eldridge must be considered a disappointment. After six weeks training, six weeks in the cookhouse, and six weeks rest he spent eighteen months in the army postoffice at Knightsbridge. Taking a healthy participation in Union affairs, Ken has upheld his academic progress, and lived at home\nduring his stay here two hours each day being spent on travelling. Tackled on this life at home he says\" none at all, there are four of us? All that is known of the between years is that, before coming to I.C. he was an architect's assistant for six months, and spent one year at Enfield Technical College, Southgate also knows him as a Rover Scout, and an amateur gardener. A great reader of other people's newspapers it was perhaps this habit which first brought him to the fore in I.C., and has undoubtedly put him in front of us today. Starting a same re writer, and' maker u per' of Felix he advanced to Sports Editor, Easter half session last year. There he developed a conglomeration of reports into a definite' back page'( unfortunately, omitting' a guide' to the pools'), and continued to fill this until called to the Editor's chair in March of this year. Readers 'of recent editorials must agree that Ken. Eldridge13 a man with firm convictions, which he is not afraid to state in the full glare of public opinion. With twenty three years behind him, he leaves College to embark upon a career in industry. Industry Itself will decide whether K.P. Eldridge in his complete range of interest, and\ndirect approach, will be the type of leader today demands. His future career might in fact, be a judgement on the new technologist. MUSIC AT THE HOPS Dear Felix, I am unable to account for the lapse of your music correspondent, writing on the subject of Music at the Hops. I can find but two conclusions: I1. He is never in a fit state to listen to any records after sojourning in the baron Saturdays.2. He has never heard records by Les Paul, etc., the names being just bai* talk that he has overheard,. and as a consequence he doesn't recognise them when we do play them at the hops. For the benefit of your sadly ignorant or misinformed music correspondent, the greater proportion of the records played at the hops are not by bands usually styled as' strict tempo'. The number of recordings by' Victor Sylvester played at an average hop is810, mostly at the begining of the evening when there is plenty of room to dance. At two hops this year, only OT'E Victor Silvester record was played( and then by request), We regularly play recordings by Guy Mitchell, Roy Rogers, Les Paul, Sid Phillips, etc.,: for quickstep dances, but the number of such recordings available to which it is possible to waltz is microscopic I know because I've hunted for more, \"fe therefore rely on Joe loss, Maurice Win nick, Josephine Bradley, and similar orchestras for most of our slow waltzes. Yours etc., Paul Jeffery. NEEDLED k th. June,1952 Dear Sir,I would like to comment on your article on the choice of music for the Hops for two reasons. Firstly, I feel that the writer greatly overestimates the saving in record cost made by the use of lightweight pickups. I am open to correction, but I think some time will have to elapse before the benefit can be felt. But my second and main criticism lies In his choice of records. My own experience of Hops has led me to regard the masa combination of dance and social occasion. The inclusion of a few records by the performers mentioned, and oTE ers of their type, might not reduce their general appeal, but such people as Fats Waller and Stan\"\nKenton are appreciated by only a limited percentage of the community, and if their fans want to Cavort to the noises they produce* it is, surely,, up to the J a az Club, or some similar organisation, to cater for their needs./ Yours faithfully, Brian H.Wy at tO NO JO! FELIX has much pleasure in publishing the latest effort( on his Prof's own Typewriter) of the almost extinct RCS Joe Soap. The Editor of Felix. Dear Sir, Imperial College is comprised of Royal College of Science, Royal School of Mines, and City a Guilds College. Why air, are not the Engineers in a building titled as the other two, \u2022 Hoya lv t On leaving College with a degree, members of R.C.S.* R.S. M. may proudly proclaim that they are Associates of a Royal College and Royal School respectively. Not BOthe that Engineer, who may only ol aim as so oia tesh lp of an Institute. Cannot something be done to repair this unfortunate state of affairs TI suggest that we\nchange the name City a Guild e College to Royal School of Engineers, so that an engineer may\nproudly say that he is an Associate of The Royal School of Engineers. Think of-1\nthe letters after his name.. Oh dear, perhaps it's not such a good ideas after all, Yours faithfully, Joe Soap. "

    "content": "F1 LIX A Horn Cup Regatta On Saturday31s tHay at Chiswick I.C. were\nrepresented by the l st VIII in the best boat division and the, 4 th VIII in the clinker boat division. In their first heat, the l st VIII rowed well beat Battersea Polytechnique easily. In the final the crew shortened up and did not hit their beginnings as hard as they might have a one, and were beaten by l*l/3 lengths by last years winners University College and Hospital Q.M. C. were some\n3 or4 lengths behind,3 rd. The4 th VIII rowed neatly to beat Battersea \u2022\nPolytechnique II by3 lengths in their first heat, their first victory of the season.* In the second heat they were pushed over into slower water at the beginning of the race by the eventual winners Barts. Hospital. Richmond s Twickenham Regatta I.C. were represented by the3 rd VIII in the, Junior event. Unfortunately they were handicapped by having substitutes at3 and stroke. In the first heat, against Kali ng for dR.C., the alteration of stroke at short. notice told, with the result that the crew never settled down to show the previous week's form. The result was that I.C. lost1/2 length. Walton Amateur Regatta On Saturday7 th June the I. C.B.C. were again represented by the first three VII Is. The l st VIII, the holders, rowing in the Thames Cup were unable to retain this trophy losing by4 length to University College, Oxford. The 2 nd VIII won their first heat in good\nsty lo beating Barclays Bank by3 lengths. In the next heat they were beaten by London R.C. who won\nthe event without being pressed. The 3 rd VIII, rowing perforce in a changed order, won their first heat against U.C. and H.B.C by\\ length. In the next heat, rowing very much\"\nbetter they had a very good tussle with Staines, who\nwon the event, losing by a bare\\ length. Consolation After the All om Gup Regatta, the Captain was presented with the Head Clinker for U.L. boats, won ( uni c n'ow ingly). by the' A' Crew, in the Head o'f the River last March. LAWN TENNIS Exit LC GoodLuck U.C.I. C.'s dreams of retaining the U.L. tennis, cup( so grimly fought for last year) for a second season were rudely shattered, on the afternoon of Wednesday June4 th, by a strong U.C. team. It is difficult to decide how the\" rot set in\".. but that there was a\" rot\" cannot be denied. Owing to the approach of examinations, the I.C.l st string( Forbes and McDonald) were not, to be available until late afternoon and so the second and third strings( Spence Bate and Gross man; Pile and Ward) Joined battle. Each I.C. string lost( by the same score of l46;57) to the equivalent U.C. pair I and it was\nobvious, even at this stage, that the home pairs had not, yet found their touch whilst the opposition were settling flown well. Then the home 2 nd string tried its lUcK\" against the visitor's third string'S ira I.C' third pair engaged U.C' s first pair. Again defeat \u2022\nalthough Spence Bate and Gross man had a grim battle before they eventually lost in three sets, the last set reaching a score of97. At this stage U.C. needed to win only one more\nmatch in order to enter the final and this they sue\nces s fully managed when the first strings met and Forbes and McDonald were beaten in two short sets. U.C., therefore, qualify to meet Kings in the final to be played in the afternoon of Sunday June15 that Mot spur Park. It is hoped that not many seasons will pass before the Cup again appears a tI.C. CRICKET Colonials We ale Beaten Advocates of brighter cricket would have delighted in the matcha tH arlington on s Thursday, when a Commonwealth XI, drawn from the Old Colonials, was defeated by K.E. We ale*s XI, drawn from anyone who chanced to be present, by an innings and5 run \u00ab . Pride of place, must be given be given to S. Wardle who scored75 in35 minutes, in the I face of intense destructive criticism from his own\nside, but later redeemed himself with a display of wicket keeping which should have made \" extras' the top score. That they were not is due to the fact that none of the umpires could remember the signal for byes.( The Old Colonials' umpires were, in fact, the mainstay of their side, particularly the one who, to every appeal, responded by signalling four runs.) M. Holman contributed20 runs to a total of132. The wickets were shared between Allsopp, Turtle and Bok, the letter's dismissal of the great We ale being specially memorable: the ball cannoning off Weal e'spa don to the wicket in a way\nwhich would have aroused enthusiasm on any billiard table. Commonwealth collapsed in their first innings and were all out for34, the sole resistance being offer ee: by R. Harris(16). In their second innings they rallied to make 9 5 , and one had time to admire the headgear affected, ranging from straw hats to baseball caps, and the imperturbability of Mc Clu rg, who, apparently un encumbered by impedimenta not normally worn externally, scored31. C oppel man ended with a match analysis of6 for5, and special mention must be made ( for is not the writer promised a beer if special mention i_s made?) of a magnificent slip catch by We ale, whose keen anticipation and steady hand showed that England need search no farther for the ideal man to carryout the drinks.* \u2022\nHook Again The traditional cricket match at the village of Hook\nthis year proved that I.C. is still thought of as one of the\nmost enjoyable matches of their season.\nThis years match lacked nothing as far as incidents were concerned, but for the record almost four innings were\ncompleted during the day, I.C. making 69 and .63, and Kook\nreplying with62 and 40 for5 wickets. Some very good bowling\nby Reynolds, acting as Captain in the absence of Oldland, and\n: Morphy was the most outstanding feature. The batting in both\ninnings for I.C. was deplorable, though it is possible that the erstwhile Charlie Gregory, hero of Hook, is a far better bowler than he looked from the pavilion. Highlights of the visit were:\n! ( i). Role y Reynolds'being STUMPED off Charlie, attempting a second run\n(ii).Reynolds again - s% Hding a bail almost to the boundary\nto dismiss a particularly obstinate batsman.\n{i5l\\M essr s.

    "content": "FELIX sF. S. LAU To be Captain of an Athletic Club in one's first year at I.C. must be a distinction which few people\nenjoy. One such person is F.S. Lau who came to the College in October, 1951, and immediately stepped into the shoes of his brother who was Captain elect at the time but moved on to Nottingham University. F.S. Lau\",\ncor simply Lau as he is generally known, came here from\nSouthampton University where he took a degree in Civil Engineering and founded the Badminton Club. Lau started playing Badminton in Malaya in1942, but he did not take the game seriously until he came to England in1947. After winning a few local championships,\nhis first big success came the following year when, at the age of20, he and his brother won the French Open Men's Doubles Championship.\nIn1950 he won the U. A.U. Men's singles champ ion ship, repeating this success in1952 when he also won the' Men's and mixed doubles championship, playing with partners from King's College. In the U. L.A.U. championship Lau has\nwon the singles and mixed doubles for the last two years, and\nalso the men's doubles this year. He again captained the I.C. Badminton Club during the last season, and at the same\ntime was Captain of the University Club. Apart from playing Badminton, Lau is working for an M. Sc. in Soil Mechanics, and he also spends a lot of his time flying. He is a member of the U.L. Air Squadron, and\nin1951 won a cup for instrument flying. In his first year at College he did a certain amount of crosscountry running, until one particularly cold day led him to the conclusion that the English climate was\nnot suited to that particular mode of improving stamina.\nWhen he has time Lau also enjoys swimming just for the fun of it. He is very vague about his future plans but\nexpects to be staying in this country for another two or three years. We may even be seeing him around next year as he\nexpects to be taking apart time course at the College. He\nwill be a great loss to the Badminton Club, mourned even by\nthe members of I. C.W. A. who were bullied into playing in mixed matches when they would rather have been playing hockey;\nthough in this resp s ct he was not as great a bully as his brother. Lau leaves the College with our very best wishes\nfor his future career and for his continued success in the Badminton World.\niff. Em\n13 ut -Sir, lt& rai j \"turn \"to discover a. Funclementa-LMU SSC IN SC CONCERT\nOn 2 9 th May there was a notable Thursday concert in the Guilds Council Chamber. This commenced with aTrio Sonata by Bach, arranged for two pianos. This was not altogether' successful either in the arrangement or the performance which tended to be ragged. The Madrigals that followed were superb, and to my mind the best part of the programme. The\nI..C. Choir under Dr. Jacques were beyond my criticism. I will say no more. I did not like the\" Rio Grande\". It is difficult to criticise a piece that has been generally accepted for years,.. but it was the first time I had heard it and it Seemed lacking. The\n. performance, however, was not lacking in any way\nand was equal to that in the madrigals; the piano solo( E.H. Brown) was played with great skill.It is said that Constant Lambert was influenced by jazz in this composition; there were hints in the piano solo of this idiom, but whilst tolerant to both kinds, I think that in Choral Music the two cannot be reconciled. However, the job of a FELIX critic is to criticise the performance( music can be far better dealt with elsewhere) and I can only repeat that this was beyond criticism. D.J. A.

She used to like to s it there, from where one can see up the street from the park, and our corner is these amateurs' final call on their way home at dusk; they make a desperate slow walk round past the doors and common rooms of the two houses opposite occupied by U.S. Marines then bacK once or twice, await in a facing doorway perhaps ours \u2022and then off they go. The new European community exists a tEl vast or: Square with these Americans representative of the next and faster culture that is replacing our own with the same start as fifty and hundred years ago the English missionaries went into Euro. e and brought back national science and the Ph.D. Passion in a bowler hat went by here last night, but the principals still rejoicing in the address of Kensington and forcing their own importance of example to the Americans are the family further down. The daughter is just too young to understand, but her mother feels too near to ignore it; the small son sees only the pistols \u2022\ncarried by the marines on duty; and father's burden is to demonstrate how to start a British car. Several houses have been repainted, and show\nup the rest their overlays coming un stucco, stained doorsteps, stale milk bottles in the win dow boxes, and curtains matching the grey walls. The Americans and their hotel followers have accelerated the decay of El vast on Square, now one\nhundred years old and following in turn the earlier nash productions in rows, squares, terraces and places that make London' sinner suburbia, the grey belt, that stretches from Victoria to Earl's Court.

From time to time he pulled a lt'.r ge silk hand er chief from his pocket and mopped his brow. The work was nearly completed but the final effort to get it finished was proving harder than he had anticipated. He had\nreached a stage when his mental outpourings were\nbeginning to dry up and was wondering if he had made\na terrible mistake in starting it at all, when his wife appeared with a cup of tea. She lean t over his shoulder looking admiringly at 'his efforts, and encouraged: ,\n\"I think it's going to be a great success dear,\nbut you really must stop and have something to sustain you.\" He stood up, hand extended for the cup, his brow\nglistening again. Thoughtfully surveying his master-piece he sighed heavily: \u2022\n\"That last crazy paving stone will ne-t fit into place.\" G.H.S. Facing the Future? Getting Kicked Out?

Union, STEPHEN A DEP EGBA In may, this year, Stephen Adepegba was killed in a car accident in Trinidad.' Steve arrived a tI.C. from Nigeria in October,\n1947, embarking upon the Intermediate Course, and in1948 entered the Botany Department whe re three years of diligent work won him an Honours degree and a scholarship to* the\nImperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad. One cannot, however, fairly sum up his career\nat I.C. so briefly. His contribution to the social aspect\nof College life considerably exceeded his academic distinction which in itself was creditable enough. His enormous\ngrin and infectious laugh were to be recognised at many\nfunctions, not least of all the dinners and socials of the\nNatural History Society and Old Colonial gatherings, where\nthose who were present will vividly recall his singing of\nNigerian folk-songs and hymns. Few will have realised how\ndesperately shy Steve was, and the will power with which he\ncompelled himself to perform at these events.\nHis driving force was a desire to foster a better understanding between the peoples of his country and of\nothers. In striving to this end, he spared himself little and achieved much.\nA great affection was felt for Steve by those with whom he worked, and no less by those who taught him. Our very real sorrow at his tragic death makes\nonly toe apparent the in a de qu cy of the words of sympathy we\nextend to his wife and two children with whom he was to hive been reunited this September after an absence of five years. \u2022\nIt is our fervent hope that this inadequacy will not obscure\nthe sincere compassion that we feel. In his steadfastness of purpose, sincerity, and\ndevout life, Steve has set an example which will be difficult to emulate, let alone surpass.\nTOUCHSTONE Music and Science to the uninformed may appear to be strange bedfellows. Yet there is no doubt that amongst scientists, music, of all the arts, has by far the strongest following. The truth of this statement is perhaps m of ct easily illustrated b^ considering the relative strengths of college societies devoted to Music, Literature, and Fine Arts, viz. l ar6e, neglig able, and none existent, respectively. It was therefore not surprising that the accommodation at Sil wood Park on the occasion of the recent Musical Touchstone was booked to capacity. The strength of the weekend lay in the contribution by the kac fi els. Mr. Mac fi el, for his frank and illuminating account of the activities of the Arts Council of which he is Assistant director of the music section, fl is main theme was that since the Arts will never be good boxoffice, wealthy patrons are essential,' i he State' therefore which seeks to equalise personal in comes must provide the patronage. Mre. Mac fi el, otherwise known a ski chel Hamburg, brought the weekend to a nena with a charming piano recital of works ranging from Liszt to Chopin. DOBSON a YOUNG The lecture given Dy Dobson and Young to a full audience on Monday,26 th May, was thoroughly enjoyed by all. Mr. Dobson, covering all kinds of music, coloured hist ali with a rich blend of service humour and some very expressive' visual aids'. The silent Mr. Young provided musical illustrations with an old gramophone. Alt nou gn entertaining and intimate, the lecture was very pointed we must listen and not. merely hear, we must discriminate, we must appreciate all Kinds of music, but\" above all we must enjoy music Finally we were assured that indigent you this preferable to opulent old age.

By a few masterful strokes of a two by four angle the charioteer dispensed with the services of all who were not actively assisting him( some\n2 0 0 ) .\nClosely hauled by the Electrical s, the Civil store up to the Par i, waived on by affable police men , and reached the bridge over the Serpentine with20 yards' lead. Over the parapet went the flag and away shot the boat beneath, propelled by\nMc Kenna and Mc Kenna, ably hindered by the Civil s captain at the rudder end and a character with a broom at the other. Due in no small measure to the fishing activites of the Civil s, the Electrical s, who were rowing strongly, began to creep up, until a boat propelled by two Civil s admirers who were not looking where they were going, caused a breakIn the rowing and a heated exchange of pretty compliments. By now the Mechanical s had given their flag to the duly grateful G he mic als and one brave, spirit delivered his flag personally, when he came\nup a ff cer jumping off the bridge. Running battles were fought as the rival crews tried, hard to overtake the leaders. The Civil s, some 5 lengths up, were met by a merman who tried hard if unsuccessfully to make\nan impression upon the discussion as to the best means of making the shore with dignity. The pennant was hurled but fell short of the bank. Rising to the occasion, or did he fall? Newman\nplunged into the water to come dripping to the bank. By now all the boats had arrived and chaos reigned as revenge was taken. ENGINEERING PAPER PRIZE The Links Club Memorial Prize for the best student paper written for the' Guilds Engineer' has this year been awarded to M.W.^ n ill for his contribution\" Methane Production from Sewage Slud<\u00a3\",\nThe prize was first awarded last year and has a value of three guineas. It was instituted in memory of the seventeen' Links' killed in the war. GUILDS CIVIL SUCCESS\nGuilds elections this year were again preceded oy the studied calm and in differences och arag teri stic of the engineering fraternity. Not for Guilds the glorious hustings of lesser places nor the introduction of the candidates to the electors before the great denouement. The few articulate members entertain the house with sparkling wit and a passing reference to their protege, thus ensuring that the best man wins.

    "content": "FELIX\n' THE NEWSPAPER OF' IMPERIAL COLLEGE EDTTCSU K.P. ELDRTDQE\nTo those who have already suffered, FELIX wishes\nthe nicest of markers, while for those about to undergo the annual ordeal, all the right questions for the answers you\nhave. May you all leave next week with light heart, enjoy\nthe pleas a it est of vacations in many lands, and come bao k next year. The remarkably short list of one from which the\nchoice of next year's President will be made by I.C. Council can be at tr ibt t ed to two major courses. The first is that a strong current opinion i3 that the Presidency of this College is much too high an\nhonour to confer upon mere mr rt als. Linked with this opinion is the belief that people of Presidential calibre are not so numerous as they were. Both are fallacies of\nevery generation; that no gods are like those of yesterday.\nAs the character of the student population develops through\nsuccessive years so do the needs of the Union and the qualities demanded of a President, though no two would\nagree as to the exact combination of qualities. Secondly there is a very not i cable reluctance on the part of men who have many, though perhaps not all, of\nthe qualities for the office, to permit their names being\nput forward. This lack of enthusiasm for self-advancement\nsprings from fears that the additional duties! will prove too\nheavy a burden. This is partly the. outcome of the practice in recent years of piling office upon office or agony upon\nagony on the shoulders of the prominent. No one man can\nsuccessfully fill two offices let alone twelve as has been\nknown In our Union affairs, in fairness to ourselves and to. our officers,' let us have one man with one job. Another, and less pardonable excuse is that Union\nwork conflicts with academic progress. The academic life here is merely a means to a fuller and better life later on.\nThat the later life has been impaired by the knowledge\ngained through work in Union office is not borne out by the\nprogress of past Presidents. Experience of this kind will prove of more lasting value than any number of Ph.Ds. Letters may secure a job - but they won'th old it. Whatever the reasons avowed or suppressed, we\nfeel that as the college is sharply divided into those who\ndo something, and those who don't, while the do's are further split into brains and brawn, with sub di it e ions depend ing upon the nature of the exercise taken. A nomination\nlist of one candidate does not recognize the varying needs\nof the different groups - nor give Council much room to\nman oe vre. While extending to the successful candidate sincere congratulations and best wishes for his term of office, FELIX cannot but express the hope that next year's President will not only be a complete bounder and utter ff ii lure, but\nthat he also reduces the t ottery structure of our decayed\ndemocracy to shambles as a fit tribute the inert individual i ties of this college. All those who have written rude letter B to us, sent in News and Sports reports, produced printable articles, verses\nand rhymes, drawn cartoons and sketches for us - and of us, helped to make up on Sundays and to sell on Fridays, or\nwhose efforts have so far gone un rewarded, FELIX offers his grateful thanks and appreciation; we hope that you will cont in ue to burden'the Editor with more material than he can\nuse. I would like to add my personal thanks to the Board of\nDirectors who have not annoyed me at all, and to the FELIX\nBoard for their willing help and cooperation, in particular to my two keenest critics Tony de Reuck and Stephen Wearne,\nK.

SUMMER PHCENIX\nThe new issue of' Phoenix' maintains the high standard set by the Spring number and at the reduced price should have a wide sale in the College, Six of the articles can conveniently( for- the purpose of this review) be taken in pairs, the first of which is' U a xi rail lian' s Last Stand' and' The Presses Roar J These are two lighthearted i pieces between which is placed the Sir Arthur Ac land Prize Ke say, the whole forming one of those sandwiches with ad elect a hle outside but a most in digest able filling. Mr. Lusher' a story is an improvement on his contribution to the Spring issue, showing a better sense of form, but has rather a weak ending,' The Presses Roar' is the Staggers story, without which no Phoenix of our generation has been or will be complete. Another pair, also humourous in content, is made up\nby ' Aethelred the Redi less' and ' Lost Oars'. The former\nis successfully amusing, not so the latter, except to a rowing type. Mr.Conway's Essay is the most substantial contribution in sheer bulk. It has been a claimed by the award of\nprize, but on what grounds I do not know. The literary style is labour ed and the intellectual approach pseudo-scientific rather than scientific. On the whole not a distinguished piece of writing. The third pair of articles should start consider able discussion in the college. In 'Touchstone Recons ide red' a domestic problem is excellently discussed and\nin The Responsibilities of a Graduate' a broader topic is dealt with. 'Souvenir de Paris' is intended as an invocation of\nthat City, but I'm afraid it would need a very much greater\nwriter than Mr.S chili zz i to succeed.\nThe photographs are of interest, and once\" again\nMr.Dadd has brightened the pages with his imaginative drawings.\nMRS AM WAYS IN BERLIN In response to repeated requests Mr.S am ways presented FELIX with a sheaf of papers on his recent visit to Berlin. The following paragraphs are extracts of the more legible portions. After the severe bombing and battles for Berlin, later to be . occupied and divided by four powers,', what did one expect to find? A desolate untidy city frustrated in attempts develop by the force of circumstances or not. The overriding condition, that affected everything was that of the division of city by two ideologies those of the East and West - the government of each sector being ir. the hands of German guards one each side, not Russian and British, Russian and American as one might expect; neither, at that time, was travel restricted from one zone to another; travelling in by the overhead railway did necessitate an inspection of papers. In the East one had the Communist system of house and street managers, secret police, enforced meetings etc. whereas in the west the way of life is similar as in England. Whilst in the West food was relatively plentiful and cheap and un rationed that in' the East, in excess of a small ration, was very expensive. Similarly with most of the things. There seemed\nto be little doubt to which side Berliner n would go\nif there was sufficient accommodation and work. Accustoming oneself to the vast amount of damage, now tidied and walled in by neat stacks of old bricks, Berlin appeared a very industrious and busy city. Avast amount of building was in progress, both in concrete, brick and stone; the products of light engineering were in great evidence, new cars, cameras, bicycles, clothes, footwear. All of which could be bought immediately if one had the money. In the evening there were bright lights, open air cafes and restaurants, concerts operas, cinemas all the activity that one associates with a continental capitol. Kurf ft rstendamm rapidly regaining the spl erft nr of former times with its wide broad streets, restaurants, stores' the new Schiller Theatre, indicative of an industrious people intent on regaining something of what they had lost. Apar,t from the inaccessibility of Berlin, one would spend a very pleasant holiday there. Life in the East( Cross e Berlin) appeared to be very different: walking along the border on May Day into Potsdam er Platz propaganda greets you from the loudspeaker system, blue shirt bind cula ted pol he eye from the windows of bombed buildings, faces regard each other across the square, while West\npolice standby. As soon as you enter an east trail all is suspicion, who and where is the police agent, when, you leave the station who is the agent, in th=\n' cafe.'s.* ho can be. trusted* everybody aSks. jai e. nn\nALL the Trophies that could be found were used \"to decorate the gym for the last hop of the year.
