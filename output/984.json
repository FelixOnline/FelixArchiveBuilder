The Constituent College Unions show their strength\nby block voting their Presidents back onto the Executive\nCommittee.\nDirty Tricks\nBY ANDREW TSENG\nAND MARK SIMMONS\nAllegations of deception and\nrestricted information have surfaced\namid concern over Mr Wensley's handling of Imperial College\nUnion's( ICU) constitutional\nprocess.\nDifficulties within ICU are\nalleged to stem mainly from the\nactions of Mr Wensley, in particular\nover the his introduction of the new\nICU constitution. The new constitution was first passed in the final\nUnion General Meeting (UGM) of\nthe 1992-93 academic year. Under\nthe previous constitution it had to\npass through a second, confirmatory U GM.A motion to act as if\nthe new constitution was in force\nover the summer vacation was also\npassed.\nFollowing the second U GM, the\nfirst of the current College year, the\nnew constitution was passed. Still\nunder the old constitution, the new\ndocument should have been\npresented to the Governing Body of\nImperial College at their next\nmeeting where, if passed, it would\ngain 'force of law'.\nWhat actually occurred is\ncurrently unclear. It is thought, by\nsome, that Mr Wensley gave the\ndocument to Peter Mee, Senior\nCollege Registrar, to present on Mr Wensley's behalf, at the Governing\nBody's next meeting. However,\nFelix has found that Mr Mee replied\nto him explaining in a detailed\nmanner that he would not present\nthe new constitution. His reasons\nran from simple typographical\nerrors to major flaws in the\ndocument. It is known that the\nconstitution has not yet been\npresented to the Governing Body.\nMr Wensley has not reported such\nan exchange, as he would be\nrequired to do under the new\nconstitution.\nPresently, Mr Wensley has not\nannounced whether the new\nconstitution has been granted 'force\nof law' by the Governing Body\nwhich itself suggests the new\nconstitution has not been passed.\nWhen asked to explain to Felix his\nactions thus far, he prevaricated.\nIn the event that the old\nconstitution is still in force, the\nPresident should have called two\nCouncil meetings this term (ICU\nBy-Laws 6a) with published\nagendas. Also, the third U GM this\nterm was not publicised for long\nenough and was not cancelled by\nthe President as unconstitutional\n(By-Laws 14).\nEven under the new constitution\nthe third U GM would be deemed\nunconstitutional (clause 5.8).\nHowever, Mr Wensley allowed it\nto take place.\nIn an interview prior to the\nUGM, Mr Wensley admitted it was\nunconstitutional but said: 'Since\nonly reports are on the agenda\nthere's nothing to worry about. I agree there have been problems\nthis term.' The President, however,\nfailed to mention a tabled motion.\nThe new constitution document\nalso places the onus on Executive\nmembers to make their activities\nknown to both the Executive and\nthe UGMs. This would make the\nfirst job of the President an\nannouncement that the new\nconstitution had been granted\nauthority by the Governing Body\nof Imperial College. It would also\nmean that any discussion about the\nconstitutional process would be\nbrought up at an Executive\nmeeting.\nWhether or not the new\nconstitution had been affirmed by\nthe Governing Body, one would\nexpect Mr Wensley to discuss any\nprogress with the Executive.\nSources close to the President\nsuggest that even his fellow\nsabbaticals are not being kept up to\ndate. It is becoming increasingly\nevident that the President has not\nacted in accordance with either\nconstitution.\nTalking to Felix after discussion\nwith other C CU Presidents, Ms\nPicton, President of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union, said, \"I believe we are in error in not\nreporting the constitutional\nproblems we have detected\". On\nMr Wensley's elision of the events\nsurrounding the new constitution in\nthe U GM and Executive meetings,\nshe continued: \"As the CCUs are\npart of ICU, we attempted to find a reason for this deception, before\nmaking it public.\"\nShe concluded: \"This can bring\ninto question the ICU Executive.\nThat there is no communication is\nevident. The position of Communications Officer is vital and must be\nfilled by a competent person. If\nyou care about anything you do in\nCollege then you should support\nICU by attending its meetings,\nbecause currently it is the students'\nvoice which commands ICU - the\nGovernment might change this\n\n"

The libretto was written\nfor Strauss by Richard Genee and it is based on\nLe Revellion, a farcical comedy by the\nsuccessful librettists Henre Meilhac and\nLudovic Halevy, who also wrote Carmen.\nThe story is that of the elaborate and\ningenious revenge of Doctor Falke on his best\nfriend Gabriel von Eisenstein who, after a particularly drunken ball, had left him to spend\nthe night in a public square still attired in full\nfancy dress\u2014as a bat! Doctor Falke, lately\nknown as Doctor 'Fledermaus', visits Eisenstein\non the eve of his arrest for a minor offense and\npersuades him to attend a party instead given by\nthe rich Prince Orlofsky.\nIt is written of Die Fledermaus: \"It is not in\nthe least sentimental and should not be\napproached in that manner. It must be danced.\nThe conductor himself must have these dance\nrhythms in his blood.\" Jerzy Maksymiuk\ncertainly realised this objective on the first night\nof English National Opera's revival of Die\nFledermaus and the music, with its many\nbeautiful waltzes, is superb.\nAlthough there is no sentimentality about the\n'haves' and the 'have-nots', this operetta, which\nis about the Viennese aristocracy in 1874, views\nthe latter darkly, emphasising its peculiarities in\ncontrast to the rosy picture usually delineated.\nEtiquette, masks and masquerades were the key\nto enjoying life! Honour was everything and\nmen were supposed to submit willingly to\nmisunderstanding and even, as happens here,\nincarceration, rather than compromise the lady\nwhen caught in flagrant edel ic to\\ A merry time is had by all at Prince\nOrlofsky's party and Doctor Falke's humiliation\nof Eisenstein is superbly engineered.

The other, Zino\nDavidoff, received some lyrical descriptions \"a very heavy, Arabian smell\u2014I like this one\",\n\"an old, spicy pot-pour ri smell\", and \"a very wooded, muted smell, not overpowering\".\nSecond place went to Aramis (\"citrus notes\", \"the more I smell it the more I like it\")\nwhich came just behind Relax, the preferred choice for its \"sweet honey/liquorice all sorts smell\".

Then the Fairy\nGodmother of electropop waved her wand,\nturning some second-rate New Order songs and\na few 'quirky' instrumentals into a glittering\ncrystal carriage of sound. Unfortunately, at\nmidnight the slick production dissolved into so\nmuch aural candy floss. The lyrics didn't help,\npossessing all the depth and intelligence of an\namnesiac goldfish, and Prince Charming eloped\nwith the Ugly Sisters rather than endure\nCinderella's saccharine singing.

John Watts, on lead guitar\nand vocals, conducted with precision and\nperfection. His intermittent comical quips were\nmore historical than asides.

Projecting pictures\nimpresses no-one if your music has left no trace\nand all anyone will remember of tonight's cacophony are a couple of good ideas wrapped\nup in tight crowd-flirting denim.\nNo, this is the sound of ugly ducks and\nanoraks; prom less, pompom less, helmet less high\nschool kids grown up and refuting all that with a flair. They are the complete antithesis of the\nprevious band, sass less sirens to the trash\nvixens. Rolling waves of cyclic noise out with a flick, twang, flick of the wrist, then relaxing in\nthe soft haven of a keyboard swell. Elemental.\nWhich must be why the idiot mosher is going\nmental in front of me. 'Cos it's so quiet and he\nhas to, like, express himself. By jumping up and\ndown to a lilting love song.

    "content": "Feature 9\nIronic Curtain: the Veiled Despair\nof the Shostakovich Five\nThe Imperial College Symphony Orchestra\n(ICSO) has consistently pleased packed houses\nand this term's concert was no exception. The\norchestra, over 100 players strong and conducted\nby the irrepressible Richard Dickins, played to\nan audience not only occupying every available\nseat in the Great Hall, but overflowing onto the\nsteps and filling the seating behind the orchestra.\nIn the first half, the choice of Bernstein's Candide overture was a happy one. This was an\nideal curtain-raise r, relished by audience and\norchestra alike. Rachmaninov's Third Piano\nConcerto is not as well known as his Second,\nand undeservedly so, for it has quite as much to\noffer the listener. ICSO gave a good account of\nit, as did soloist Geoffrey Saba, although\noccasional slips were noticeable in the latter's performance. The audience was carried along on\nthe wave of decadent emotion that Rachmaninov\ninvariably inspires and I for one found it most\nenjoyable. It was the second half of the concert,\nhowever, which confirmed that this, although\nperfectly competent, was not the best ICSO\ncould offer.\nFrom the arresting opening bars of\nShostakovich's Fifth Symphony, it was clear\nthat before the interval we had been hearing only\nwhat was written. This was where the or che s tra's hearts lay and they were now playing what\nwas felt. The story of the composer's difficult\nlife under the Stalinist regime is well known and\nICSO's rendering of his Fifth Symphony, with\nwhich his troubles are perhaps most often\nidentified, was highly evocative of the feelings\ninvested in the work. We can only imagine the\nImperial College Symphony Orchestra rehearse Rachmaninov\ndespair the composer must have experienced in\nthe Russia of the early part of this century, but\nICSO all but transported us there. The sublime\nLargo was particularly moving and the more\nboisterous passages of the symphony were\nadmirably played, yet never losing their touch of\nirony. The impressively tight [Shurely s homem ish take? \u2014Ed\\ and highly professional percussion section made an especially effective\ncontribution.\nRosemary Pearce\nNext term, ICSO tackle another pinnacle: Mahler's Fifth Symphony\n3D Christmas Crossword ~ Day XO ~\nAcross\n4.

    "content": "Opinion 27\nStudents Face \u00a38,000 Debt By Year 2000\nAn opinion article by James Connolly and\nMichael Wright:\nThe 10% cut in student grants announced in\nthe recent budget has called the principle of free\naccess to education into question. A similar 10%\nreduction will take effect each year until 1996\nwhen projections for London indicate a grant of\n\u00a32074 and a loan of \u00a32182 per year. A survey by\nBarclays Bank anticipates an average overdraft\nof \u00a31045 per student at the end of their course. It\nis likely that graduates will face an average\n\u00a38000 debt. Increasing student poverty is in-evi table. A recent survey by Stirling University\nshowed that 15% of students have been forced to\ngo without food at some time. Malcolm\nThornton, Conservative MP for Crosby has said:\n\"I have heard enough to suggest there is some\nsubstance to the claims of hardship. It is now a question of trying to quantify it.\"\nFurther, graduates will face pressures to start\nrepayments rather than seek pos graduate qualifications. Undergraduates face similar pressures.\nDropout rates increased 155% the year student\nloans were introduced. This debt is compounded\nby an additional \u00a375 to \u00a3150 per year from\nstudent union reforms and cuts in club or society\nfunding being debated in the House of Lords.\nICU has taken action by lobbying the\nuniversity chancellors and vice chancellors and\nby writing to MPs. A petition protesting the\nproposed reforms has been launched by Andrew\nWensley and has collected 1200 signatures. A show of hands at the U GM on 10th December\nindicated unanimous support of union policy and\nthe funding of union lobbying campaigns from\nunion funds. The union is currently circulating\ndraft letters of complaint to union clubs. The\nsuccess of this initiative will depend upon the\nresponse and enthusiasm of student members.\nWhinge, Whinge, Whinge\nDear Felix,\nImagine my surprise when, having read the\njustify ably disgruntled Marcus Alexander's revelations, open-mindedly entitled 'Grumble,\nGrumble, Grumble', I noticed that Owain\nBennallack's spellbinding rhetoric was not appropriately entitled 'Squirm, Squirm, Squirm'. I can\nonly presume that lack of space prevented it.\nPersonally, I thoroughly enjoyed M.A.'s article about London's galleries; far from being\nlofty or patronising it was a welcome reminder\nthat not everyone at this college suffers from the\napathy we hear so much about, \"...isolated...in\nyour ivory garret...\"\u2014what a wonderful meta-ph or. It's odd, but that image you so beautifully\nconjured up fits more with many people's perception of that last bastion of journalistic vision,\nFelix. I can understand that Marcus' informative\nprose had to be shelved in favour of more tales\nof the no-holds-barred, action packed, rollercoaster ride that was the weekend in Cambridge\nwith the well-known Juliana Hatfield and our\nown dear Owain. When it comes to serving up\n\"slices of life\" he certainly gives the thrill-hungry IC students the lion's share every Friday.\nEnough thinly-veiled contempt, though,\nbecause essentially all of the above is just my\nopinion and I certainly don't expect the editor\nand luminaries to agree. But I do expect the\nRapunzels of Beit Quad to listen. It's good to see\nexchange of views, however vitriolic, especially\nif some sort of change results. We know that it is\nimpossible to please all the readers but merely\nstating those words then proceeding to print an\nexhaustive review of eminently miss able records\nand a delightful account of how those zany\nRaggies while away their weekends, is not good\nenough. The issue of not printing good material\nis serious, though: the clam our ing for new\nwriters could soon sound hollow if Marcus' case\nis not the only one of its kind. A bit like the\npotential effect of the King's College rape case\n(before Kristine Vaaler replies indignantly, I do\nappreciate the seriousness of the latter).\nPicking up on one last point, as it happens I write the boat club articles and it amused me to\nsee that we were singled out as ungrateful free-loaders, taking all the credit but not prepared to\nput everything back in. The reason for us public ising ourselves is because we can, and we feel\nproud of our achievements. We're very grateful\nto Felix for being there for us to do so, as I expressed to Felix staff at the time, although after\nthis I doubt our coverage will be so extensive\neven in the 1994 editions, echoing with space for\ncontributions. If you don't think we're a good\nadvert for the college or that we should be given\nthe chance to show those who have donated time\nor money to us, what they've been part of, just\nring up the Rector and ask him. Perhaps you'd rather we followed the cryptic 10-line match\nreport favoured by the rugby/football/hockey\nclubs that keeps us abreast of their nicknames\nand drinking antics but not a lot else.\nAs for your selfless hours of toil for the good\nof the masses, perhaps when you've finished\nyour arduous collating stint at \"6am in the\nmorning\" you could get down to Putney as\nyou'd be just in time to go for that spin down the\nThames.

Ruth Rendell, unfortunately, can't. Add in the fact that the three books in this\nOmnibus (The Face of Trespass, A Judgement\nin Stone and A Demon in my View) were written\nin the early to mid-seventies and you can then\nsadly reflect the fact that you have a rather\ndisappointing and expensive door stop.\nI don't like books that are billed as\npsychological thrillers, so this may taint my\njudgement, but these stories tend to just narrate\nthe rather dull lives of the main characters and it\ncomes as rather a relief when the victims are\nfinally bumped off and the perpetrator(s) are\ncaught (usually within ten pages).\nIt's always a bit tricky to give an idea of the\nplot of crime stories without giving too much\naway, but these three can be summed up as:\ni. Jilted lover extracts revenge,\nii. Murderous misogynist, and\niii. Psychopath does what comes naturally.\nIf you have a long train journey or if you are\nan insomniac, you could try it, but I wouldn't bother.\nMJ& RN Published by:Arrow\nPrice: \u00a38.99\nThomas\nby Sarah Shears\nWith the prospect of an operation and at least a week's convalescence confined to bed, I grabbed gratefully at this book. Being an avid\nreader, I was hoping for more than just\nsomething to take up a little time.\nThomas is set in the late 19th century, at a rough guess, and follows the fortunes of\nprivileged and spoilt Thomas Cartwright, as he\nmakes his rather predictable way through public\nschool, Sandhurst and finally his marriage to the\n'adorable' daughter of his commanding officer.\nFollowing in the mysterious footsteps of his\nlong dead father, Thomas takes his young wife\nto India. References to a dark secret surrounding\nhis father's death in India are supposed to hint at\nthe tragic ending to the story.\nBut unfortunately I found myself as lacking\nin curiosity as Thomas himself. When the\nmystery is finally revealed, in the last few\npages, the reader has neither been involved\nenough nor sufficiently entertained to feel any\nreal emotion at the outcome.\nA tedious read, it is one of those breed of\nbooks that you find yourself hoping against all\nthe evidence, is going to improve. Spare\nyourself and don't bother with this one.\nBeachball\nPublished by: Bantam\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nVirtual Light\nby William Gibson\nCyberpunk (a genre embracing current and\nimagined future computer technology, combined with prophesied urban decay) can lead to\naward-winning books or those that exist only in\nsecond hand bookshops.\nThe reasons stem from originality and\ninvention. Virtual Light has both, from a sprawling shanty town covering the entirety of\nthe Golden Gate Bridge that would keep\nRentokil busy for weeks, to new designs for\nbikes for messengers cycling around San\nFrancisco.\nWritten in a style that is hard to put down,\nthe story races after an ex-cop, Berry Rydell,\nfrom Los Angeles who just wants to make a living and an ace bicycle messenger, Chevette,\nwho lives in the a fore mentioned shanty-town in\n'NoCal's premier city'. It combines all of the\nelements that a story needs\u2014big guns, fast cars,\nthe rich with their impenetrable 'stealth houses'\nfull of drugs, virtual reality sunglasses and\ndesperation and it even has the an element of a desperate, Terminator-style romance.\nThis book is a good introduction to\nCyberpunk and even Sci-fi for those not yet\nacquainted with the writing styles, but for those\nwho are familiar with them and the author,\nVirtual Light is another example of the genius\nand originality of William Gibson.\nGinster\nPublished by: Viking\nPrice: \u00a314.99\nf Mouse And Mole Have A Party\nby Joyce Dunbar with illustrations by James Mayhew\nIf you have a young brother or sister, son or\ndaughter and are looking for a good Christmas\npresent, you should look at this book. If you are\na self satisfied smug bastard who thinks\neveryone at college is like himself (M@ rc#s...)I suggest you skip this article.\nIn this sumptuous ly illustrated book consisting of three endearing tales we dip into Mouse\nand Mole's idyllic life where Mole is getting\ninto constant scrapes and being helped out by\nhis friend Mouse. Certainly the loyalty of their\nfriendship is enviable and we could learn a thing\nor two from them.\nMole is worries about his lopsided reflection\nin the mirror and, while attempting a dash of\nDIY, he snips a little too much of one side of his\nwhiskers. Oh dear! With a little help from Mole,\nRabbit and Rat, Mole's world is soon happily\nreconstructed.\nA pleasure for children and adult storytellers\nalike, if a little over priced at \u00a38.99.\nRekha Nayak & MJ Published by: Doubleday\nPrice: \u00a38.99\n\u2022 ' li Merry Christmas!\n\n"

Thus, the modern crossword was born and gradually evolved. Felix has decided to evolve the crossword a little further\nby adding another dimension - literally.\nHow It Works & Why It Is Easier Than Its Normal\n2-DimensionaI Cousin\nYou may have noticed by now that the corners of the next 12 pages are\ntaken up with 12 crosswords. These make up a12 x12x12 layered cube ...\nour crossword grid! The puzzle is solved in exactly the same way as a standard cryptic crossword with the addition of a set of 'through' clues as\nwell as the normal 'across' and 'down'. The squares which contain letters\nfrom a 'through' clue are shaded in grey for the solver's convenience.\nDon't be daunted! It will soon become apparent that far from being more\ncomplicated, this crossword is actually easier to solve due to the extensive\ninterlinking of words.\nCompetition Rules\nThe closing date for the competition is 12pm on Friday 14th January 1994\n- the first Friday back. First place will be awarded to the owner of the most\ncompleted grid and, in the event of any ties, names will be drawn from 'an\nitem of head wear(3)'. Points of Reference\nConsidering the seeming originality of this feat, we thought we should\ninform the reader on the compilation of this puzzle.\n3D Multi-axial Symmetric Grid Designer: Penguin\nClue Construction: Sphinx (Ed.), Toot, Catfish, Stan, Jaymz and Penguin\n(when desperate)\nEach layer is 4-way rotation ally symmetric in the plane of the page, and the\nwhole stack is 2-way rotation ally symmetric in the other two dimensions.\nErrata\n1. Day 4, 1-d. As clue Ed. was in bed at the time of going to press, a substitute clue escaped his attention. The preferred clue is 'Looked at again\nas very red Sue is irritated (10)'.\n2. Day 3, 14-a. 'Luckily, MP has swallowed pus (5)' not 'puss'.\n3. Day 3. Grey square missing at reference 9 along and 9 down.\nThe complex interlinking of words has (unavoidably) led to one or two\nanswers which may be considered unorthodox. Rest assured though, all\nwords/phrases have been thoroughly researched and are English (p hew!). Thanks\nHeartfelt thanks go to our generous friends at Collins, Chambers and\nHodder & Stoughton for donating the prizes; Rose for typing in grids; the\nWord Perfect spell check; whichever dictionary would give us the relevant\nwords or definitions we wanted and the bottles of Cabernet Sauvignon.\n- Happy Puzzling!\n3D Christmas Crossword ~ Day IZ~ Across\n1.

    "content": "Opinion 25\nSecure Parking\nDear Beccy,\nI'm long overdue for a rant, and seeing that\nthey're starting to become popular again I thought I'd join the fray.\nAs a member of the Operatic Society and\ntherefore involved in the production of\n'Chicago' early next term, rehearsals now\nhappen three times a week. For reasons that are\ntoo lengthy for this letter, but which I assure you\nare worthy, I drive into College for these\nevening rehearsals.\nThis Tuesday, with the sell-out whatever-it-was at the Royal Albert Hall, the traffic was bad\nand parking worse. I was late so I knew I need n't bother trying to park in front of\nSouthside, because as soon as the main roads get\nfull, punters drive down the nearest side street in\norder to park\u2014believe it or not a small, un lit 'Authorised Access Only' sign thirty feet up in\nthe air does not deter them from parking in\nPrinces Gardens. So I tried to find a parking slot\naround Queensgate\u2014seeing as I was heading for\nthe Huxley Building anyway. This proved to be\nquite tricky, but ten minutes later I found a parking slot. Off Emperor's Gate.\nWhat really gets my goat is that there's a colossal and half-empty car park just off\nExhibition Road. Do you know it? It's Imperial\nCollege (and yes, it is half- empty even though\nhoards of RAH punters are parking in it).\nHowever, despite being a student at this centre\nof commerce, I'm not allowed to park after\nhours in my own college's car park unless I pay\nthrough the nose for the privilege.\nAre you bored yet? I'm not finished. My next\nobstacle that evening was to get into the\nbuilding. Now this is a real test. I'm in Mech\nEng which means that my swipe card is actually\nredundant, because the front doors are never\nmag-locked. It also means that I don't have\naccess into Huxley. I have permission to play all\ngrand pianos in college and there is one such\npiano in Huxley. So here I am, I 've got my\nPianos\nswipe card in one hand, my piano pass in the\nother, I go to the security desk in Sherfield and\nask to be given access to buildings with the\npianos in. Can I get clearance? 'Oh no, I couldn't possibly give you access to these\ndepartments. It's more than my job's worth.'\nBasically, I'm allowed to play the pianos, but\nI'm not allowed inside the buildings to play\nthem. Hmmm.\nSo holding my security clearance tightly in\nmy right fist, I went to the front door of Maths\nand used it to knock on the front door (they\nthoughtfully have not installed a bell). However,\nthe ever vigilant security staff were not in their\nlittle house\u2014so no surprises there\u2014so I stood in\nthe cold and gnashed my teeth for a while. Two\ninmates of Maths saw me outside the door trying\nto get their attention. I was overwhelmed by the\ngenerous way they rushed to the door to let me\nin\u2014not. Thanks guys. I went round to the front\ndoor of Physics, knocked on the door and rang\nthe bell. However, the ever vigilant security staff\nwere not in their little house\u2014so no surprises\nthere\u2014so I stood outside in the cold and more\ngnashing of teeth took place.\nThe day was saved (hurray!) by someone\ncoming out of Physics who is about the only\nperson I 've every met who understands the way\nDidn't They Do\nDear Beccy\nThe ArtSoc committee would like to wish our\nmembers a Happy Christmas. We thank them for\nallowing us to organise a wonderful series of\nevents.\nThis term, ArtSoc has seen Les Miserables,\nAn Inspector Calls, Blood Brothers, Five Guys\nNamed Moe, The Magic Flute, Arcadia and\nAladdin. Planned visits for next term include\nsecurity should work. He opened the door, but\nbefore allowing me in he checked that I was a member of College and had ID of some sort.\n(Have 10 house points and go to the top of the\nclass).\nOkay, so after the rant, what am I saying?\nI'm saying three things.\n1. College is geared totally and utterly to\nmaking money without giving a thought for the\nstudents: it wouldn't hurt to let students park\nafter hours for free. However, they don't. Why\nnot? There can't be many who would do it, so\nthere'd still be plenty of spaces for public\nparking.\n2. The security system is not up to scratch, as\nborne out by this episode. People that do need to\nget into other departments cannot because the\nsecurity staff are never there and students that\neventually let you in almost never check your ID\n3. Chicago is a fantastic show and will be\nhappening in the Great Hall at the end of\nJanuary. It will be like nothing else seen before,\nso see it.\nYours exceedingly pissed off, but good for a quick promo.\nDerek Hirst, Mech Eng PG.\nWell?\nPhantom of the Opera, Miss Saigon, Carousel\nand The Woman In Black.\nDon't forget that we will be meeting in the\nUD H on the first Monday of term, 12.30pm to\n1.30pm. Until then, have a fun holiday (but\ndon't do anything that we would not do!)\nCraig Brierly, Eleanor Corran, Dan Slattery,\nBecky Cotton, Harsh Pershad, Helen Roberts,\nAndrew Walker, Joanna O 'Keefe and Tim.\n3D Christmas Crossword ~ Day % ~\nAcross\n2.

The Rector's office releases a paper giving implementation details of a merger with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School.\nFelix 983 Following a 'breakdown in communication' the\nnursery closes for almost a week. Less than one working\nday's notice is given. Parents are in uproar. It is announced\nthat Bill Raines one of the College's chaplains is to leave for\na new post in Manchester.\nFelix 984 Virginia Bottomley announces a cash injection for\nUniversity College Hospital. St Bartholemew's loses its\nAccident and Emergency department. Experts predict the\nimminent death of Bart's as a general hospital.

Have another think before\nbuying presents for your small\nrelatives.\nThis was the message given to\nparents and others by the\nEngineering Council (EC) last\nweek.\n'Girls should be offered more\nthan just soft materials, but also\nhard materials such as construction\nsets', says the Council. Parents\nshould also involve their daughters\nin maintenance and simple\nconstruction in the home.\nBelonging to an engineering club\nand visiting science museums\nwould also greatly stimulate girls'\ninterest in engineering.\nIn a foreword to the booklet\n'Engineering Equals For Parents',\nSir John Fairclough FEng,\nChairman of the EC, and Margaret\nMorissey, former chairman of the\nNational Federation of Parent\nTeacher Associations say:\n\"Technology is part of everyday\nlife whether it is using a microwave\noven, a video tape recorder, a bank\ncash dispenser or a computer. Girls\nwith confidence in science and\ntechnology will enjoy a better life\nbecause they will make full use of\nthe technology at home, at work or\nin their leisure.\"\n'Engineering Equals For\nParents', with an introduction by\nJohn Patten, Secretary of State for\nEducation, includes examples of\ngood practice, places to visit, useful\npublications and sources of\ninformation. It is being sent to all\nprimary and secondary schools,\ncareers services and main libraries\nin the United Kingdom.\nThe booklet is the fourth in a series of 'Engineering Equals'\nbooklets targeted at parents and\nstaff in schools and higher edu-cation. It forms part of the Women\nInto Science and Engineering\n(WISE) campaign started in 1984\nby the EC and the Equal Opportunities Commission to encourage\ngirls and young women to consider\ncareers in engineering.\nSince the launch of WISE the\nnumber of young women studying\nengineering in higher education has\nrisen from seven per cent to more\nthan fifteen percent. The EC has\nalso produced posters and\npamphlets to promote the\ncampaign, backed up by events in\nschools and local communities.\nFive WISE vehicles have been\nequipped with technological\ndevices to tour schools giving girls\npractical experience of technology.\nAlbertropolis\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nImperial College could be\nassuming a whole new look in the\nfuture. A \u00a3100 million bid to the\nMillennium Fund has been made to\ntake the whole area from the Albert\nHall to the Natural History\nMuseum into the 21st century with\nstyle.\nThe plans, proposed for\ncompletion by the year 2001 could\nchange the whole of Imperial\nCollege with raised lawns and\ngardens above car-parking areas.\nIan Caldwell, Director of Estates\nfor Imperial College, said there\nwould be \"improved facilities for\nstudents\" and the whole scheme's aim was to \"improve the environment of the area\". If the plans were\nto go ahead, the completion date\nwould coincide with the 150th anniversary of the prominent\nbuildings on the site. The buildings,\nbuilt for the 1851 Exhibition, were\npart of an idea by Prince Albert to\nbring together an area of science\nand the arts.\nAccording to an article in The\nTimes, Imperial College would\nbecome a campus, with Prince\nConsort Road being pedestrianised.\nMr Caldwell, however, dismissed\nthese claims as: \"largely inaccurate,\nthey are only artists impressions of\nproposed ideas. It is unlikely that\nany of the roads in the surrounding\nareas will be closed as this will\nreceive high opposition from\nresidents.\"\nIt is still not certain whether\nanything will come of the\nproposals, the 'Albertropolis'\nscheme is still competing with the\nRoyal Opera House, the South\nBank and the Tate Gallery for the\n'Millennium funds'.\n\n"

Arnolphe has\nspurned marriage on such grounds because he\nhad a plan. His knack is to find a simple,\ncontrollable girl who will still do the washing.\nThe plan progresses. Arnolphe takes a young\nward, Agnes, whose development he restricts to\nensure her affection and loyalty. We enter as he\nprepares to tie the knot with his subservience.\nYet in a manner clique d by love, in walks a handsome upstart, Horace, who falls for Agnes\nand tries to steal the object of Arnolphe's dignity. Complications abound. Horace doesn't realise that Agnes is Arnolphe's proposed bride\nand so he confides their plans for love to his\nprotagonist.

    "content": "Reviews 17\nThe Free Radicals of Europe Bang Their Drums\nCamille catches a blast with Europe's techno, Nazi-smashing heroes, ATR.\nAbout six months ago, ATR (Atari Teenage Riot)\nslipped onto the scene with modest exposure as\nAngry Young People, intent on stamping out the\ncurrent resurgence in fascism. Hailing from\nBerlin, this sexy bunch are multicultural,\nmulti talented, and have welded together an\nincredibly energetic form dubbed as techno-punk by taking the essentially escapist techno,\nfusing punk ideals to it, and ending up with a confrontational genre that just oozes.\nHaving just given them a hype-up in the\nusual media whore vein, I will come clean: I am\nslightly cynical of their attitudes. Don't get me\nwrong, I do support anti-fascism, but isn't it\nreactionary for groups to just jump on to\nideological bandwagons? Sure, the whole notion\nof youth culture rests on the creation of identity\nand the feeling that you can actually do\nsomething - from nobody to somebody, via me\nto we and ultimately Us and Them. But surely\nthis kind of approximation of polar opposites is\ndetrimental to direction less youth, as it has a de human ising effect and becomes a convenient\ntag akin to bad stereotyping. Are all these neo-nazis skinhead b ov ver boys with swastikas\ntattooed on their foreheads?\nEnough of the babble. ATR consist of one girl\nand two boys: Hanin Elias , Carl Crack and Alec\nEmpire, who does the talking with the odd\ncackle from Hanin. Read on.\nHow did you get the name Atari Teenage Riot?\nIn the beginning, the name was invented to\ndescribe what was going on, in that everyone\ncan produce records at home and it is much\neasier with technology to change things.\nWhy particularly Atari?\nFor me, Atari isn't just computers, it's also\nmanga (comics) and everything. And it's a turn\non for us.\n(Atari Corporation have asked them not to\nuse the name, so the band have officially\nshortened it to ATR.)\nYou've been hailed as the 'new-punk', what do\nyou think of that? They compare us to punk because of the kind\nof energy that comes across, but it's not like new\nwave. We were actually too young when punk\ncame out, but I 've always liked the attitude.\nDon't you think it's ironic that the neo-nazis use\ntechno as a cohesive force as well?\nThat was actually our main reason: people\nwere shouting 'Sieg Heil' to records and this\nhooligan scene had developed. When it started, I knew that it could be very dangerous if you put\nthe wrong message onto music capable of such\nenergy so I thought there must be another side.\nTherefore it's not the music that's guilty, it's the\npeople who are using it.\nYou cite violence, do you really mean it? Or is it\njust confrontation-as-a metaphor-for-violence\nas often used in music (eg Sid Vicious' violence\nwas often theatrical, even though he was really\nangry, in reality he \"couldn 't punch himself out\nof a paper bag \" - Johnny Lydon).\nWell, if there are skinheads in the audience\ncausing trouble, they'll get something, and I don't care.\nSo, it is literal?\nYes, in a way. I'm not against violence. I know this is going to sound bad, but in\nGermany, where the Police support the whole\nGovernment and the asylum laws have been\nchanged, what else can you do? The younger\nnazis just don't understand, and you can't fight\nthem normally because you never meet them.\nWhat can you say to people without a cause?\nThey've got to realise that they are important.\nAnd that one person can change a lot.\nWhat words can you leave for the future?\nATARI TEENAGE RIOT!!!\nSuch were Alec's words just before ATR went\non stage at the Astoria 2. Their set was actually\nquite stunning, but the throng were generally\nunmoved. Why, why, why? Carl, who'd been\nrespectfully silent through the whole interview,\nmetamorphosed into an aggressive MC, Hanin\ninto a very sassy mediator and Alec as one angry\nmuth a**** er. However some of their anger did\nspill into the crowd: when confronted with\nAlec's story about his Grandfather being killed\nin a concentration camp, one punter shouted\nsomething to the extent of 'Speak to me in\nEnglish, or I'll have you', to which another\nreplied 'Listen to what he's trying to say, you\nC**t'. Their last single, a cover of Sham 69's 'If\nThe Kid's Are United' is awesome and sublime.\nAlmost like a glamour is ation of riot, it was\nperhaps a facet of the view that \"violence is\nessentially gratifying\" - Stephen Berkoff. My\ninitial cynicism to their ideological purity and\nirony in their means were soon an aes thetis ed, though not completely quashed. But heck, who\ncares about pedantic hacks anyway?\n3D Christmas Crossword ~ Dcfty \u20ac\n> ~\nAcross\n2. A bounder and an egghead return\nobjective of learning (8)\n5.

    "content": "News 3\nBart's Backlash\nBY SHAUN JOYNSON\nAND MARK SIMMONS\nHealth Secretary Virginia\nBottomley has secured the future of\nUniversity College Hospital\n(UCH), by granting the teaching\nhospital special funding following\nits loss of more than \u00a320m worth of\ncontracts.\nThe special cash award to UCH\nwas made at the expense of the\nhistoric St Bartholomew's Hospital\n(Bart's) in the City. Bart's is to lose\nits accident and emergency\ndepartment in October next year,\nreinforcing fears that the historic\nhospital could close permanently.\nMrs Bottomley made it clear\nthat Bart's cancer, day surgery and\nAIDS work would continue for the\nfor see able future. It has been\nwidely reported that a group of City\ncompanies have approached the\nCorporation of London with an\noffer of money to keep Bart's casualty department open.\nThe current proposals could\nreduce Bart's to a 'minor injuries\nclinic' open only during the day.\nThe private funding would aim to\nmaintain Bart's capacity to handle\nserious injuries. This possibility\nshows the depth of concern workers\nin the City feel over losing the\nhospital, which provided valuable\naid in two recent terrorist\nbombings. The Government is\nseriously considering the offer of\nprivate subsidy but has not yet\nmade any announcement.\nThe changes announced are the\nGovernment's first concrete\nreaction to the proposals for the\nfuture of London's healthcare as\noutlined in the Tomlinson Report.\nMrs Bottomley said the special\naward to UCH would safeguard the\nhospital as a 'centre of world\nrenown and excellence'. She has\nnot made public the full amount of\nthe award, but hinted that the\nGovernment would rescue the\nhospital again in the future if required, saying: \"I am ruling out\nthe long-term closure of the\nhospital.\"\nThe funds will be given to the\nIslington and Camden Local Health\nAuthority who will spend it on the\nhospital once the Government has\napproved it's expenditure plans.\nGranting UCH extra funds is seen\nby many health experts as an\nadmission of failure by Government, and a reversal of the policy\nof encouraging the NHS internal\nmarket.\nIn the same document Mrs\nBottomley announced nearly \u00a315m for London's Ambulance Service\nand \u00a325m for capital development\nat Homerton Hospital.\nDavid Blunkett MP, Shadow\nHealth Secretary, responded: \"Mrs\nBottomley's announcement on\nUCH, while welcome, is an\nadmission that Government\nchanges to the NHS have failed.\nShe should suspend the operation\nof the internal market system which\noriginally threatened UCH, which\neven Sir Bernard Tomlinson\nrecognised had a vital role in\nLondon's future health provision.\"\nFurther condemnation of the\nHealth Secretary came from health-workers union, Unison, who said\nthat the announcement represented\nthe beginning of a gradual\ndismantling of London's hospitals.\nDecisions regarding Charing\nCross and Westminster, Hammersmith and St Mary's Hospitals are\nexpected in the New Year and may\npotentially have repercussions on\nthe status of Imperial College as\nreported in Felix, Issue 982.\nAppointing Advisers\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nThe Rector of Imperial College has\ngone green. Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nformerly the Chief Scientific\nAdviser to the Ministry of Defense,\nwho became Rector in September,\nis the new chairman of the Inter\nAgency Committee on Global\nEnvironmental Change (IACGEC).\nThe Committee supervises all\nUK scientific research on changes\nin the global environment. It\ndecides the national research\nprogramme for this vital field and\nensures that public sector money is\nused effectively.\nSir Ronald's main responsibility\nas chairman will be overseeing the\nIACGEC's annual policy update,\nwhile also providing a liaison\nbetween the various Research\nCouncils and Whitehall on issues\nof global environmental change.\nAnnouncing the appointment\nProfessor William Stewart, the\nGovernment's Chief Scientific\nAdviser, said: \"I am delighted that\nSir Ronald has agreed to chair the\nCommittee.\"\nNovember\nThe words unions, unity and university\nstole the limelight during November.\nFollowing the end of the student union reform consultation\nperiod, the NUS pre-emp ted the Government by announcing\nthat it was to split. Separation was also the topic of\nconversation for the University of London. Unity became the\nfocus when the University of London Senate voted not to\nseparate but come to compromise. John Smith joined the fray\nby stressing unity in science. He also spoke of the equal\nimportance of pure and applied science.\nI If II IV; W7\n3\nFelix 978 NUS announces that it is to become a charity.\nStudent affairs would be handled hy the charity, whilst\ncampaigning would be in a separate arm of the NUS. Imperial College becomes the first academic institution in the\nUnited Kingdom to have a student branch of the IEEE.\nSecurity thwart an attempt at smash and grab theft.\nFelix 979 Fears grow over the future of the University of\nLondon. Queen Mary and Westfield College announces that it\nwill seek permission to award its own degrees. A Royal\nSociety report, headed by ex-Rector, Sir Eric Ash, calls for a review of student funding. Development plans for the\nwalkway are finalised. ICU President, Andrew Wensley,\nreveals estimates of costs. The new shops will cost ICU\n\u00a325,000 in the first year.\nFelix 980 John Smith, Leader of the Labour Party, speaks at\nImperial at the invitation of Save British Science. In a speech\nhigh in criticism and low on facts, many of the audience go\naway unconvinced. The Queen's speech paves the way\ntowards the reform of student unions. Estimates of impact to\nICU run to \u00a3200,000. Long sought powers from the\nUniversity of London are finally obtained. After much\ndiscussion, the University of London Senate delegates the\nability to award degrees and appoint senior staff. James\nWilson, a second year Chemist, is thrown out of his hall of\nresidence after being found with drugs.\nFelix 981 John Patten publishes the long-feared Education\nBill. It introduces a 'core' and 'non-core' student funding\nmechanism. Many criticise the lack of detail in the bill. Sir\nFrank Cooper, Chairman of the Governing Body, celebrates\nhis 71st birthday. The CCUs sort out their executive\nproblems. Steve Hoborough is elected C&GC U VicePresident whilst Steve Dorman becomes the RCSU Honorary\nSecretary.\n\n"

    "content": "8 Feature\nA Multi-lingual Celebration from\nImperial College Choir\nRare Honegger is triumphantly revived, hut Haydn proves elusive.\nListening to Haydn instead of Mozart has always\nseemed to me to be the musical equivalent of\nvisiting the National Gallery and spending the\nwhole time in the shop, browsing through the\npostcards. It's a controversial view, and a Haydn\nenthusiast may well have found more to admire\nthan I did in Eric Brown's reading of the\nHarmoniemesse in last Friday's IC Choir\nconcert. But, despite a character ful contribution\nfrom soprano Benedicta Moes, I was not drawn\nin to the performance: in the ' Gloria', for\ninstance, the climactic 'Qui toll is' seemed to\narrive and depart almost by accident.\nThe second half of the concert began with\nVivaldi's Magnificat: all the familiar ingredients\nwere there\u2014the scrubbing violins, the solemn\ntread of the bass line and the velvety buzz of the\nharpsichord. Nothing deep here, but the whole is\ngreater than the sum of the parts and it works\nbeautifully. A much less well-known figure is\nArthur Honegger, whose Cantate de Noel\ncompleted the programme. Like several of his\nsymphonies, it's not as widely performed as it\nshould be, perhaps because it's far from being\nthe trite carol compilation one might expect. The\nwork begins with a despairing 'De Profundis',\ndramatically led by the basses and the final\npoly glottal peroration is hard-won. Here the\nchoir came into their own, cleanly projecting\neach strand of the contrapuntal web, with only a hint of roughness in one or two of the sopranos'\nmore stratospheric passages.\np||||l| S|i' Professor Brown moulds a phrase\nNext term, IC Choir will be performing Verdi's awesome Requiem.\nWith Shining Brass and\nSoaring Voices\nThe players in this term's IC Performers'\nlunchtime concert had to contend once again\nwith the coffin-like acoustics of the Read\nLecture Theatre, as well as the attendant\ndistractions of buzzing, flickering strip lights and\nthe thwack of the ticking clock. The close, dry\nsound is not kind to solo strings and Rebecca\nMileham's crisp and incisive piano-playing was\nthe highlight of the Allegro con b rio from\nShostakovich'sE minor piano trio. (Actually I was hoping she'd play Scriabin again, so I could\ndescribe him as the Ozzy Osborne of concert\npianists on account of works such as Black Mass\nand Satanic Sabbatical.)\nAfter a welcome rarity from James Marchese\nin the form of the first movement of\nHindemith's Clarinet Sonata, the final group of\nmusicians made light of the venue's problems. A brass quintet, they called themselves / Tune:\nappropriately enough, since they did and also\nbecause the trombone and tuba players are\ncalled Sharp and Key, respectively. They displayed uninhibited enjoyment in a four-number\nset which ranged from Dvorak to Jelly Roll\nMorton.\nIn marked contrast to the Read Lecture\nTheatre was the resonant interior of Holy Trinity\nChurch on Prince Consort Road, the setting for a lunchtime concert given last week by the ICbased madrigal group Elysian Voyces. The five\nsingers brought a feather-light touch and,\nparticularly from soprano Sarah White, a soaring\npurity of tone to their programme of Renaissance polyphony. Tenor Frank Taylor directed\nwith assurance, although he occasionally looked\nlike he was churning an invisible barrel organ in\na heavy sea.\nPatrick Wood\nErratum: for 'Sabbatical', read 'Sabbath'.\nIC Student in\nPodium Debut\nEvery classical music lover has imagined conducting an orchestra, although most get no\nfurther than flailing the air in front of their hi-fi\nwith a makeshift baton. But third-year mathematician, Sarah Too, having surmounted all the\ndifficulties of forming and rehearsing her own\norchestra, took the podium last month for the\ndebut concert of the Imperial College Sinfonia.\nDespite the unyielding acoustics of the\nUnion Dining Hall and a muffled percussive\naccompaniment from the Wing Chun enthusiasts practising overhead, the rhythmically alert\nand disciplined orchestra provided over an hour\nof enjoyable music-making. Particularly engaging\nwere the infectious bounce of the last of\nBartok's Rumanian Dances and the rocketing\nviolins in the foot-tapping finale of Mozart's Symphony no. 29.\nPatrick Wood\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Survival Guide\nPart 1: Surviving Christmas at Home.\nJoe McFadden provides crash-course in buying presents, avoiding parents\nand enduring other festive pursuits\nMost students look forward to Christmas as\nsome much-needed R&R after a stress-filled\nterm. This is particularly true for first-years,\nwho've had to rise\u2014or more likely sink\u2014to the\nspecial challenges of\nuniversity life. Home is not just an\nThese inevitably include 7 .\nmaking friends you'll keep aW Oy leg On the\nfor life (or 'til the end of T7r Freshers' Week, whichever three~year pU O CrOWl\ncomes sooner); acquiring . .\nunusual hobbies for your O/ degree dOM CV (\"A third in Elec. Eng.,\nbut you speak Inner Mongolian and ride a unicycle? The job's yours!\") and, oh yes, getting\na degree.\nChristmas is for recovering from multiple\nend-of-term hangovers or, in extreme cases, the\nhangover you've had continuously since term\nbegan. Take a complete break from wild parties\nand your new-found friends. Instead, go to wild\nparties with all your old friends...\nBut home is not just an away-leg on the\nthree-year pub crawl of degree dom; it's a happy\nhunting ground where the thermometers don't work on the Kelvin scale, and the fridges\noverflow with milk and honey (as well as\nturkeys and mince pies and Christmas pu d... well,\nyou get the idea).\nSo why delay? Book your flight today for\nan orgy of Bennallackian excess: a three-week\nbender of such pagan proportions, it'll take all\nnext term just to recover.\nBefore you start packing though, remember\nthat every silver lining has a cloud. Going home\nalso means three weeks with your parents (the\nnice people who lend you money and provide\nlifts, remember?). How do you cope?\nThe ideal solution is having the house to\nyourself. Leave subtle clues to your parents\u2014\nwinter holiday brochures for instance\u2014and\nhopefully they'll get the\nhint. Of course, if they do\ndecide to go skiing in\nColorado, it's probably\nworth enduring their\ncompany! But usually,\nyou'll be stuck with them\nat home; if you're not\ncareful, your Christmas\nwill turn into a remake of The Shining. So here\nare some ways of keeping sane:\nStay out as much as possible. You'll get to\nsee your friends and also avoid arguing with\nparents. This strategy can cause problems\nthough, especially when you return home after a night of drunken revelry with a sudden urge to\nwatch late-night television and have a fry-up.\nFine in a student house,\nbut parents often take a dim view of such\nactivities.\nSometimes, your presence is unavoidable\u2014such\nas Christmas dinner or\nwhen relatives visit. These\noften dull occasions can be\nmuch enlivened by training the dog to maul any\nparticularly obnoxious aunts, uncles, cousins...\nParents may want to \"know how you're\ndoing\", Luckily, most parents only need vague\nreassurances that you're not turning into a drug-addict, sex fiend, or Young Conservative; just\nsay you're enjoying the course so much you're\nthinking of doing an extra year (thus preparing\nthem for when you res it the year) and they'll be\nhappy. This won't work with parents who are\nuniversity lecturers though.\nAnother common problem during the season\nof mince pies and merrymaking is the giving of\nChristmas presents. This year, you're doing your\nXmas shopping early, right? Right. Christmas\nEve, 5pm, you'll be frantically trying to recall\nyour girl/boyfriend's size while engaged in a tug-of-war with a shopping-crazed grannie over\na woolly jumper. Why not save some money and\nmake the presents instead? All you need is some\nsticky tape, copious amounts of bog-roll and an\nold Blue Peter video. The look on their faces as\nthey unwrap your masterpiece will be something\nto behold.\nThen there's receiving Christmas presents.\nDifficult this. Disappointments are inevitable\nand every year it's a little harder to grit your\nteeth and thank Auntie Beryl for yet another\nhand-knitted corduroy\nIf you're not careful, cat suit Worse ye t>J younger siblings always\nyour Christmas will seem to get a better deal than you. To even the\nturn into a remake of odds contract 8 mystery\nterminal illness, then lie\nback and wait for the\ninevitable torrent of gifts.\nChristmas being a time of miracles, you will of\ncourse have recovered in time for New Year. A relapse may be useful during exam season.\nFollow the advice in this guide, and you\nshould make it safely back to Imperial for next\nterm. Because let's face it, home is a nice place\nto visit, but you wouldn't want to live there.\n'The Shining'\n3D Christinas Crossword ~ Day XX ~\nSCRIBBLE PAD Across\n3. Ruin small potato (5)\n5.
