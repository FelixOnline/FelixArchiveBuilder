    "content": "S CC MEETING The Union's social o lub s can be\nroughly divided into three groups i nat--ional clubs, religious clubs, and poli fci calo lub s. In the former category\narm* the Arab, Chinese, Indian, Pakistan,\ne?.,i PcVish Societies. The general aims of\nth*i \u00bb3 \u00ab>oie ties seem to be the str eng thea.-;<% of morale among their own members,\nwho are' ossetia ll y resident in a strange\ncountry and to act as ambassadors to the\nrest of the College.\nThe Jewish Society seems to fall mid--way in classification between the nat--ional clubs and the religious o lub s. There are two evangelical Christian soo-- ie ties, the Student Christian Movement\n(S. C.M.) and Christian Union (C.U.) The C.U, requires its members to a co~e pt ten points of doctrine, whereas\nthe S. C.M. will accept members of any\nChristian denomination. To cater for specifically denominational interests there are the Catholic, Church),Anglicm./\nand Methodist Societies. There is also the naw ly formed Islamio Society.\nHumanists are represented by the Huxley\nSociety.\nThe political societies have represent\n-at ives of the four main parties in the\nConservative Sooietyjsthe Socialist Society, the Liberal Society, and the\nMarxist Forum. In addition there is the Inter national Relations Club (I. C.R.) which acts partly in the role of hosts\nto overseas students and partly as a forum for the discussion of international politics. Lastly there is the Campaign\nfor Nuclear Disarmament (C. N.D.) The activities of these societies are controlled, co-ordinated, and pro--mote d by the Social Clubs Committee\n(S. C.C\".) on which a representative of\neach society has a place. The S. C.C. administers grants to the societies, disbands the moribund see ie tie a and\napproves the formation of new ones.\nAs a reminder to members, the next\nS. C.C. nee ting 'is a$5.45 p.m. on\nOctober 17th.in Conmittee Room \"A\". The Recreational Clubs Committee has\nbeen formed in order to- ease the admin-- is tr at ive burden of the S. C.C.

They were d is appointed.\nThe Imperial College jazz scene looks\nall set for a blistering year. Notable\nnew ventures are the new hard-bop group,\na funky piano-les3 quartet,an outfit,\nfeaturing two trombones,and a seventy-five piece rock band. Jazz club chief\nMike Saith'.is expected to blow hard-driving skins,with the odd skull and\nChinese block thrown in. Nut-boy baS3 player,John Farnsworth,will be bending that big-toned fiddle. I am told he was la st3een heading south from\nGlencoe,on the road with bass,trom-bone and five crates of Scotch, Like\nNut-boy is Itinerant! He carries his Chinese dictionary with him aS tall time3. Since the end of last session,the Jazz\nclub yak-harness has disappeared. This is going to make things difficult for the\nJazz club yaks.

We also hear\nthat the Union office is to be used for lunch hour confessions. Charges will be\nmodest,and a pay-as-you-confess scheme\ni3 to be introduced.\nOverheard*on the ICWA corridor;\" I don't' think Is hall have to get married.\"\nWe hear that Bob Finch's sister is besmirching the family name by joining the\nC.U. Perhaps the college's leading infidel will soon renounce Scrutiny and start wearing holes in his trouser knees in the\nUnion office. Suggestion to end the eternal refectory queue;Ban undergraduates from the\nUnion.\nHe are pleased to note that the 1\nlatest issue of Phoenix is the best for some time. The lay-out was especially good. The Phoenix board are disappointed\nwith the sales,however.l/6d isn't very\nmuch to pay, really. Shame on you all! Sight for sore eyes 6n the \"Christian\nUnion printing machine;a notice which s says\" Pray before you Print'! We now presume that our editor will dash out and _\nbuy some second-hand cassocks,whilst the\nstaff busily clean out the Felix collection plate.\nCongratulation- -o Jtooney On the opening of the Buttery in Queensgate,for evening meal a for postgraduates and members\nof staff. The quality of the food here\nis very good.One improvement to all the\nrefectories which would cost very little in terms of time and money,is the provision of paper table napkins.\nWe have heard that the takings in the\nBar during the last3 es sion showed a record profit. The profit made in the bar\nhas,for some years helped to reduce the\nloss made in the refectory,but last year,\nthe refectory also made a profit. Surely\nit is not Union policy to run the bar at\na profit, at the expense of student's hard-earned grants. Then why doesn't the refectory committee reduce the price of beer?\nIt is to be hoped that in the immediate future the antiquated magic-box in the reading room will be replaced by a more reliable model. The present one suf-fer s from severe fatigue. Strange buzzing\nsounds are continually heard and mysterious white lines occasionally whizz across the screen. The Union can certainly afford the extra1+3 per week(out of bar\nprofits?) for a new super-de-luxe model.\nThis would certainly satisfy the most\nillustrious and overworked gentleman at\nI.C. Indeed,an inspired President could\ngo further and arrange for a gigantic .\nscreen to be fitted into the wall,as at\nULU. The sight of beau tio us ICWArians\nacting as usherettes and selling popcorn and ice-cream would soon make the\nreading room the most popular in the\nUnion.\nWith the start of a new session,re fec tory queues have once again become quite\nintolerable. The trouble is that nothing\ncan be done about them. The kitchen, in fact,seems to have been designed in order\nto defy all attempts to improve it. With\nrefectories on three floors to be supplied from one small kitchen,the(Standard\nof meals is inevitably low. ' '.'\n\n"

The Chairman replied in the negative,but said that\nas an alternative the grass had been al lowed to grow and he hoped this would provide a suitable solution. He added that\nhe was still Saconsultation with the groundsman about this.\nIn reply to a polite question from the\nchair, the Hon,Sec. said that there was\nno o or red pond eno e. \u2022\n: lect ions followed.

Ramsbottom and C, MaoCrae were elected to\nthe 'Executive.Mr.Kealey was elected to\nthe e ol ours sub-committee and was also\nappointed gymnasium organiser.\nOn the question of finance,the Chairman emphasised the importance of \"\"the\naccuracy of the estimates,so that the necessity Bfb asking for supplementary grants\nat abate r date night be avoided. This is important because the ACC budget is worked out at tha beginning of the session\nand supplementary grants tend to upset\n.the balance.\nThe Chairman also said that all o lub income must be paid directly to the Hon.\nSenior Treasurer(Dr.MoCoubrey)and that\nthis money must not be used as a source\nof petty cash. This was to be obtained\nfrom Dr.MoCoubrey.\nTwo tour reports war* read.The or ioke t club gave an expurgated version of the\nDevon tour,, and the Lawn Tennis o lub gave\nan account of their tour in Holland.\nWith regard to the matter of colours,\nseveral observations of note were made by\nMr.hill(Frea.I,C.U.).

Ramsbottom drew attention to the)\nuntidy habits of certain weight-lifter s in the gymnasium. In reply.Mx,Hill said\nthat the a Union rule existed wh i oh empowered the Gymnasium Officer with the\nright to forbid people to uae the gymnasium without his approval,and that this\nrule oo ul d be invoked in suo h cases.\nSince there was not mu oh other bus in ess, the meeting was closed\"somewhere about\nRUGBY The Fresher's reception proved once\nagain that the game is increasing in popularity. This year 100 freshmen or\nthereabouts have expressed the wish to\nplay. Attendance at the constituent college trials on Wednesday and the I.C. tri als on Saturday(de3 pite the terrible weather)were excellent.\nULU also held their trials on Saturday,\nand 11 I.C. men were there.

June for\na ten days tennis tour of the Netherlands.\nUnfortunately we were not able to\nsend as Strang a team as we hoped, and\nonly two of the touring team were regular members of the 1st. VX. When the\nt eur was first proposed rost of the\nCollege's better players had been en-thus i a stic, but at later stages found\n\u2022'themselves unable to come for various\nreasons. Thus our hosts were.in evita bly left with a very err on io us impression of our standard of play.\nOur first day in Rotterdam was\u2122\ni pent in sightseeing,and the following\nlay we travelled to Delft,the strongest\nof the Dutoh Universities^or our first mato h.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nSOCCER On the first Wednesday and Saturday afternoons of term the College Soccer\ntrials mare held at Harlington.About\n70 fresher s attended,and I should like to take this opportunity of -welcoming\nthem to the Club.The standard of football amongst the fresher s appeared to\nbe high,and as a large number of last years' players are still in College,I think we can look forward to another enjoyable and successful season,It is inevitable, however,that it will taKe one\nor two weeks before the teams settle down,and fresher s should not become too\nimpatient if initially they find they\nare playing in a team whose football really does not suit their own ability. It is hoped,as for last season,\nto run seven teams.As well as matches\nin the London University Leagues many\nfriendly matches have been arranged so\nthat most people will be playing in two\nmatches each week.Trips to Swansea,Oxf or d, Cambridge, Southampton.etc. have\nbeen arranged and it is hoped that each\nteam will make at least one trip during\nthe session.\nThis season i a particularly important in as much as we hope to complete a hat-trick of London University\nCup Pinal wi noVIn the 1959 and I960 Cup\nFinals.,respectively,Kings! and Gold smiths were beaten and this session we\nmust again start as favourites.Nine of\nlast year's winning side are still in College.\nThe Coll sg* Cliib has, in the- p aar ft, supplied a large number of players to\nthe University XI's, and it is probable\nthat this tradition will be continued'.\nBasil Jamea,the Welsh Amateur to tern a \u00bbWional,has again been elected captain,\nwhile Colin Caseraore is fixtures secret-ary.\nI was sorry to see John Ereece\nwalking about' College with his arm in a sling. I hope John makes a speedy recovery, and that we will see him in action\nagain after Christmas.\nFixture cards are now available and can be obtained from officials of\nthe Club.Training sessions are held on\nTuesdays and Thursdays at 12.30 p.m.. Finally I should like to remind everyone to tick their names off on the team\nsheets as early as possible.\nCROSSCOUNTRY At the Freshers reception,twenty f res hers sighed on for the club. On Wednesday\n5th October,ten of these accompanied by a a similar number of old lags,went to Petersham for a training run. Although this\nrun was officially not competitive,two\nfresher s, led Wilkina and John Young,show ad excellent form.\nDespite the absence of captain Jim Bernard, I.C. runners were' very much to the\nfore in the UL \"trials held over 65 miles\nat Parliament Hill Fields on Saturday 8th October, John Collins and John Cleator\nfinished 6th and 7th, while Fete Warren\nwas 9th. The last named followed by Sod\nWilkina,Dave Hammonds and John Young.\nTed Wilkins and John Young were the only\nfreshmen from any oo lle ge to he placed, in\n$he first twenty.\nJUDO Last year the Club had a most im--press ive season, bringing off several\nrather surprising victories. Perhaps\nthe most pleasing result of the season\nwas a win over a rather large and hefty\nMet. Police team after some vigorous\nand spirited fighting. Wo are hoping to have a fairly extensive programme of matches again\nthis year and I would once again like to appeal to members of I.C. to allow\nthe police team to come safely to the\ngym. as we would like to have a bash\nat them first. Last year the Club had three members,\nJ. Sheperd, M. Butler, and N. Ramsbottom who\nfought regularly for the University team\nand represented the combined South East\nEngland Un ives i ties team. John Sheperd\nalso fought his way into the English team\nand is now reserve to the Great Britain team.\nThis term we are holding a course for beginners on Wednesday evenings in which\nwe are hoping to teach the art of break-- falling and some of the basic throws of\njudo. Why not come along and be secure\nin the knowledge that you will be able to defend yourself wherever you go, when-ever you are fit to go out.\n\n"

Mr.Fotheringham objects* to\nthe interminable wrangling s encountered at Union Meetings. Surely the\nwhole point of a Union Meeting is to allow each member the opportunity to\nexpress his views on the running of his Union. Perhaps Mr.Fotheringham forgets\nthat the Union belongs to all its members and not to the sheltered few. - even\nthe slimy left-wingers pay their fees.\nAs far as the propagation of\nnew societies is concerned,Mr.Fothering-ham a a at ly twists tha- facts'. to suit his distorted argument. Despite a Union meeting resolution supporting the Boycott,\nthere has never been a Boycott society,\nand there has never been any suggestion\nof a Pacifist Society.\nMr.Fotheringham objects ^o the\nlogical suggestion that the President be\nelected by the Union General Meeting.\nObviously,the only hope of having a President supporting his violently reactionary views is to have the election done\nin camera by a few sycophantic or on iea, purporting to represent the more responsible elements of the College,\nI suggest that Mr.Fotheringham\nreturns to the home of the gentleman\nand ex grc is es his venom by whipping a few wo gs.

But perhaps I should explain\nthe situation. It all began last Wednesday when\nI bought a copy of your latest issue and\nturned in a desultory fashion to the Editorial page-I was our io us to see who was\nproducing the paper this year. I was electrified to see,at the bottom of the list, that I was business manager. I didn't remember being appointed to this post,but\nthat is not surprising since I usually\nforget a whole pile of junk - science\nfor in stan oe over the summer vacation.\nBut then it struck me that I was\nholding a espy in my hand without anyone\nhaving told me to get on with the business of managing; - I mean the managing\nof the business,or whatever I was supposed to do. That was most odd;how the\nhell would you have produced the w re to he d thing without my assistance? I was\nhe g in ing to get really worried - was. I suffering from a Peouliar Case of Amnesia?\nHad I imagined the whole thing?Was it really Felix I waa hold lng? Where was I?...... Who was I? What was I? A light dawned, - it wasn't me at all, but someone else;there is another P. Vfoung in. the college.\nNow Sir,you o an understand my\nfeelings about this matter and you undoubtedly see the reasonableness of my\nrequest. If as I suspect - this\" P. Young\"is really p.B.

However,you may be referring to\nthe Boyoott sub-oom mitte e of the Inter national Relations Club. I would point\neat that this is aa established eo amit tae and not a proposed society. Moreover, to\nmy knowledge there has been no attempt to\nform any other group to deal with this au bj eot. What then were you referring to in your letter in the last issue of Felix? If you were referring to the\nIRC sub-oom mitte e, then.aa founder of this a oo tait tee. and as Hon.Sec of the IRC,I would\nappear to qualify as \"a person in charge\nof a society and trying to form a South\nAfrican boy o ott society.\" Thus,I am described by you as \"a slimy left-wing Footnick\" or communist. My main occupation,I discover, is either dragging out Union\nMeetings by interminable wrangling s, or\ninsidiously sliding myself into command\nof so oie ties. In reply, I would say that *\n>\nbefore your letter, I thought I was a relatively normal I.. ACKILLAN TORY. I genuinely\nthought that I had been democratically\nelected to my office and I felt sure that\ntry speeches at Union meetings never lasted\nmore than a minute.\nThus I would ask you to help\nme. If you'are not mistaken,then,can you\nexplain how,overnight,I have turned into the evil monster you describe.\nI eagerly await your esteemed\nreply. Yours Faithfully, D.S. Keroer.\n\n"

September in bright\nsunshine we soon ran into heavy t raff ic and were delayed in several jams.\nAs a result Of this we arrived late in Basildon and missed the start of the\nparade. However, by judicious use of\nthe accelerator we managed to catch up\nalong the route. appropriately e nou gl the parade ended up at a oen aer cia l vehicle repair station where the oom--pet ing vehicles were lined up far the\nConoours d' Dominant among the entries were\neleven Model \"T\" Fords, and a1922 de Dion road sweeper. This fine veh--iole was complete with de Dion rear\naxle and with all attachments in we rk ing order.\nThe Conoours d' Elegance was fol lowed by a driving test. In this the\nPresident of the R.C.S.

One of the photographs en\nthis page shows Jim reo ei ving the prize\nfrom the president of the H.C.V. C. The\nother photograph, for the benefit of\nthose new to the College, is an older\npicture of \"Jez.\" in Prince Consort Kd.\nAfter securing the prize money we\nmade a hasty getaway.

Once,and only once,have I ever been\nsailing,and it was the most incredible affair.

We set off. \"Steadyl\"he cried,\"We're\ngoing about J\" \"Aboutt?\" I said.\"About\nwhat?\"And then it happened, tilt ha sudden swing the boat attempted to turn a right angle,the thing that hangs from the\nmast hit me,and I was hurled into the\nwater.

The\nlatter.form, an overwhelming majority\nand are essential to the smooth\nrunning of the organization. By\nv blunt ard ly t f6 re going their legitimate rights, they free the\nfinances and facilities of v 'the\nUnion, wh i oh are, in any o a so, quite inadequate to cater for all potential customers, for the use\nof the less-a ead em lo ally fixated. Brown-Baggers are usually smartly\ndressed and have the appearance of\nharbouring in oi pie nt ulcers. By no means are they *e~* be o on faa ed with those other smartly\ndressed men of hurried step and\npreoccupied expression, whom you\nwill find are going not to leo ture s but to oom mitte e meetings. These\nare Tpp i len( or Union Officials) and\nreally are harbouring ulcers, in spite of the tennis, Suoh men will often\nbe seen wearing ou riou sties on Thursdays: this is definitely the ultimate\nstatus symbol sartorial wise. Between these elegant extremes\nslouch a variety of oi ks, odds and\nsods, clean-limbed, clear.eyed quick -thinking British Youths, ets., who\nalone provide the administrators with\nsomething to administrate. It is to\nthem, the very bao kb one of our Glorious\n\u2022College, that, these remarks are primarily dlr ao ted. Who else reads Felix any way; it is.no substitute far2** Times,Wool, etc.\nThese Keen^Typee o an be sub-divided\ninto Beerdrinkers and Others. This dist in sti on tends to be oom e rather 'indistinct\n\u2022 especially around dosing time. Neverthe-less one should point out the official obj eot of Frehers Dinners is to loo-ate the obvious supping talent as early\nas possible with a view to grooming it for future stardom. ]^\u00aba j jeo$ ive\nSporting Types should bear this well in mind especially when not really first teas material; i to an make all' the*\ndifference .\nThose, who don lt happen to like beer (especially the southern va rie ties derived by degradation from denatured dish-water) sf toul d, in-gen-era l and along with the less e ner get io beer drinkers head for the lesser glories and greater oom forts offered by\nthe numerous Social .Clubs, Sou'ld you\nbe Exsoutive 'material' this route to\nthe Top is not unduly disadvantageous.\nThe s a in objective of.Joining any\nclub is to get elected to the cc at mitte e,33 \u00bb&\u00ab is simply a maSter vT getting:\npbs ed and seo on ded by other prospective\noom mitte e members an return for similar\nfavours. Having thus become a demo o ratio ally chosen representative on as many\ncommittees as possible you will then\nstand 3ome 'sort of chance of getting in to Hostel It.is of course true that some\nFreshers are already in residence.\nWe can only hope, that the Union will survive this fundamental blow to its s tru o ture. The optimum position i3 to have been in residence as long as\npossible and then to move into a flat in Queen's Gate; but this takes\ntime. Meanwhile, you should a quire a motor bike or battered old par, which\nwill be dead cheap in view of the\nadvent of Vehicle Testing, and park it in sens prominent place. It is an\nadvantage to be seen working on it at intervals, since it will not then be\nneo ea a ary for the thing to a st a ally go\nand money o an be saved on petrol, 'On the academic side it can be\na good thing to repeat a year but this is tricky and, in any case, you will want to get a sufficiently good degree to do ai.G. course. This is essential if you are to fulfill your\nUnion potential. In general, do not\nmake the mistake of pushing to or amu b h;it rubs people up the wrong way.\nFor example don't go jumping Sefreotory\nqueues, however long, just to.be seen\nwith the right people; it is much\nbetter to buy them a drink in the Bar\nafterwards. They may buy you one some\nday and then you are in - after a fashion. A policy of conformity with\nin your chosen group always -pays off best.' ' The fao t that this group may\nhold radical opinions; pro-N.U.S., down-with-Council, etc., is neither\nhere nor there provided you are\nconsistent. By all means air your\nviews in Fell*\"and at Union Meetings,\nthen everyone will know where you\nstand. That i3 the eae nti al point.\nI have, of nec es it y, had to\ngeneral is e extensively in this short\ntreatise. Never-the-less it is my hope\nthat a careful appraisal of my remarks,\nwill assist the new comer in adapting\nhimself to thi3 novel environment.\nAnd the best of British luck l Diogenes.\nFOOTNOTE; Any la ok of mention of\nICWA, ULU etc., is fully premeditated.\nAnd that was all for a moment\n, nothing happened, the cigarettes glowed\non,the smoke rose upwards, then:\n\"Okay, Lights\" - the director slewed round in bis chair. \"I think you'll\nagree,Nicky, that was pretty hopeless.,\nWe'll have a re-shoot, but if you can't do better - wail, we'll have to get\nsomeone else.

Yours were\naa terrified as the herrings.\"\nI stood at the back of the projection room and watched the falling star.\nFALLING STAR I stood in the dark and watched,\nNicholas K. Housman had had this\ncoming to him for a long time, the\negotistical swine. So I stood in the dark and smiled.\nThe amer ioan diplomat is t pattered down the stairs from the Emb\nba say. Briefcase under arm, carnation in buttonhole and the em aou lately clean suede gloves gripping\nthe elegantly tapered cane, he\nswung off down the road into the\ndusk. The confident stride of\nthe man who o on trolled\". the destiny\nies of hundreds of states,\nthousands of towns, millions of\nlives, oo ul d be heard long after he had disappeared into the failing\nlight.\nThe tread of his follower was\nthe very antithesis. Furtive,\nskulking, the swarthy foreigner-kept the Ambassador in sight. -They threaded their way\nthrough the Belgradian Mews co un try, through the thickening\nyellow gloom, over the glistening\neo bb leste nes. They were in the\nheart of the maze now. They pass\n~ed the pink and yellow doo red flats\nand the long lines of dirty garages.\nThe*foreigner knocked on a garage\nwh i oh instantly opened on well oi led hinges. But we followed the\nstriding American along the foot\nof the ravine formed by the tower\ning flats, passed the battered\ndustbins, their lids askew, with\nthe emaciated kitten gnawing at\nthe rotting herring with the\nphosphorescent flesh. The American paused on,the\ncorner and fumbled for his gold\ncigarette case. 4ie oat oh him up\nhere'beneath the cone of fee fb le \"light\nemitted by the street lamp with the\ndramatically broken pane. Its rays slanted his well-nourished face\nand deep-set eyes. The rumble of\nWest\"*End traffic could be heard in the distance and was now joined\nby the purring of a large car as it crawled up the mews.\nHa tossed the ma ft ch away and\nstepped on to the cobbled road. The\nRenault's headlights p ioke d him out.\nThe roar of thirty horses, released\nsimultaneously,ricochetted up the\nmews. Housman threw himself desperately backwards,blinded by the\nblazing lamps. He slipped on the wet\ncobbles.' His legs waved grotesquely\nin the air. The silver buffer reared\nover him, the on-side tyres soy the d towards his body. Frantically he r ol led into the gutter. The next second\nthe cold gritty rubber appeared to pass\nover his elegantly creased trouser-leg. The car jolted and swerved and\nHouseman must have felt the heat of the\nexhaust beat on his face. The car\nskidded to a halt. The Amerioan lay there writhing in a pool,of ir ri descent oil stained water,\nwrithing amongst those beautiful colours.\nThat expression on his face - it was\ndamned funny really, I could hardly stop\nmyself-laughing. The doors slammed.\nHousman made a desperate struggle to\navoid the iron bar which flashed down\non his close-cropped skull but it's diff i ou lt to move fast when both your\nlegs are broken. That part was done\nwell enough. The now filthy suede\ngloves feebly warded off the blow, but\nit landed neatly on his temple. His\nhead dropped back into the oil-stained\nwater and the blood, tricking from his ear, added its lustre to those beautiful colours.\n\n"
