    "content": "FELIX, Friday January 30th19872 Gay Welfare Officer\nThis week the Welfare Committee has\nbeen distributing a questionnaire\nwhich includes a section on sexuality.\nStudents are asked to indicate whether\nthey are actively gay to any extent, or\nhave a homosexual tendency. Few of\nus, if we are honest with ourselves,\nwould put a tick against\n' 'Heterosexual.'' My own entry would\nbe in the \"You have had a sexual\nexperience with someone of the same\nsex\" category. This week's letters\ncolumn includes criticism of Council's decision to co-opt Robert Daniels as\nGay and Lesbian Welfare Officer. The\nargument that such an officer is\nunnecessary does not hold water at\nIC, where the \"perceived or actual\"\nattitude of students towards\nhomosexuality is so retarded. During\nthe three and a half years I have spent\nat College I thought there had been\nlessening of this paranoid fear of\nhomosexuals and a move towards\nmore liberal views. I was saddened\nto hear reports that several students\nhad made abusive comments about the\nappointment of a Gay and Lesbian\nWelfare Officer. Because such a large\nproportion of the student population\nare not used to an environment any\nless cloistered than the one they\nexperience at Imperial College, it is\nfairly easy to see how this\n\"homophobic\" atmosphere persists.\nThis is exactly why a Union Officer\nis required to look after the interests\nof the silent minority of gay students\nat IC. If gay students have a higher\nprofile within the Union they will, in\ntime, break down ignorance and\nprejudice, and this can only be to the\nbenefit of all of us at Imperial.\nwere by the boycott of the bars last\nyear. Last Friday's EGM was not\norganised very efficiently, however,\nand though I agree that it was\nimportant to gauge the feeling of the\nassembled students, the Executive\nshould have been better prepared with\nspecific proposals.\nHopefully the Union will now be in\na stronger bargaining position to win\nsome compensation for the loss of\nUnion space. At the time of writing\nthe Union Sabbaticals are in a meeting with the College Secretary to\ndiscuss the issue. We hope to be able\nto give details of this in the late news.\nAnother chance to work\nfor FELIX\nThere will be a staff meeting today at\n12.30pm in the FELLX office to\ndiscuss plans for the next issue and\nfor the rest of term. Please try to come\nalong and tell us what you think ofthe\nnewspaper. We shall be trying to find\nall the faults with today's issue, so if\nyou want to complain, now is the\nopportunity.\nCredits\nMany thanks as usual to Nigel\nWhitfield, David Burns, Chris\nEdwards, Kamala Sen, Pippa\nSalmon, Sundi, Neil Motteram, David\nWilliams, Judith Hackney, Sunny\nBarns, Liz Holford, Alen McNeil,\nAaron Kolcheff, Jane Spiegel, Sarah\nKirk, Drain and Hamster, Bill\nGoodwin, John Recamp, Christine\nTaig, Pete Wilson, Mark Cottle,\nJackie Pierce, Dave Colley, Steve\nShackell and Rose Atkins.\n1 g tter s Goosen\nattacked\n, '\nDear Editor,\nThe FELIX interview with Peter\nGoosen at South Africa House gave\nhim a free hand to express the South\nAfrican government's point of view.\nHaving spoken to many South\nAfricans here in London, I feel it is\nnecessary to comment on the points\nraised.\nFirstly, the issue of sanctions.\nGoosen argues that sanctions slow\ndown the pace of reform, since the\ngovernment has less money to spend\non areas such as black housing. Yet\n15% of the annual budget goes to\ndefence (compared with Britain,\nwhich spends around 8%). On top of\nthis, the government maintains an\nenormous apparatus for repressing\npolitical activity and enforcing\napartheid, ie the police and prisons.\nIn 1986 some 40,000 people were\ndetained, of whom nearly 9,000 are\nstill in prison. Some economists argue\nthat South Africa's rate of economic\ngrowth would be 2.5% higher, were\nit not for apartheid. The slow pace of\nchange is due to obstinacy of the\ngovernment and not to sanctions.\nThis brings me to the second point:\nthe credibility of the South African\ngovernment. How can Goosen be\nbelieved when he says that they are\n\"committed to the abolition of\napartheid\" when they continue to\ndetain and harass thousands of people\nwho are working for the\nestablishment of a more democratic\nsociety? When the number of\nassassinated or \"disappeared\" rises\ndaily? When even children are\ndetained and tortured? (These\nincidents are well documented by\nAmnesty International). No\nrespectable leader in South Africa\nsupports the g over ment' s so-called\nreforms at present. Even the\ngovernment acclaimed leader,\nButhelezi, rejects the new National\nStatutory Council.\nFinally, for the government to\ndemand that the ANC must renounce\nviolence before negotiations can begin\nis not a statement of principle, but a delaying tactic. One of the largest\ngroups organising within the country,\nthe UDF, is a non-violent\norganisation, yet its members receive\nthe most brutal treatment at the hands\nof police and soldiers. Under what\ncircumstances will the South African\ngovernment be prepared to renounce\nviolence? Also under what\ncircumstances will the minority South\nAfrican government be prepared to\nmake a positive step towards creating\nand maintaining a more representative\ngovernment? In this context, for\nGoosen to say that he will be over to\nImperial College \"like a shot\" sounds\nmore like a threat than a promise.\nYours sincerely\nIni Urua,\nChem Eng PG\nAppointment\nof Officer\nCriticised\nDear Dave,\nWe were shocked to read in FELIX\nof the appointment of a Lesbian and\nGay Welfare Officer to Council on\ntwo counts:\na) Christine seems to have assumed\nthe nec ces s it y of such an officer. Did\nshe conduct a survey to gauge\nstudents' response or need for this\npost? Does she know that homosexual\nstudents want such exposure? Will\nthey flock to the side of the officer\nwhen there is already an excellent\nservice provided by them in ULU?\nCo-opting an officer before the results\nof the College questionnaire are\nknown is rather shortsighted.\nb) If there is a representative for the\nminority of sexually different students\nthen surely Council should have\nrepresentatives for the French,\nNigerian and even Welsh members of\nCollege. Surely it is more reasonable\nto consider thoughtfully the problems\nof each student minority than rush\ninto trendy-lefty fads without a mandate either from the homosexuals\nor the student body as a whole?\nDoes this not smack as a kind of\ndespotism?\nYours Sincerely,\nJason Reese, Physics II,\nStuart Farhead, Physics II,\nSaul H Rowe, Physics II,\nG.L. Kennedy, Chemistry II.\nQT boycott\nunreasonable\nDear Editor,\n1 am writing to express my concern\nat the result of the 'extraordinary'\nUGM on Friday. It was decided to\nboycott the QT bar in order to gain\nUnion control of it. Even though I quite understand the Union's point of\ncontinued on page 4\nJCR and QT\nIt was a relief to see that the boycott\nof QT was well supported by students,\nand it is significant that College\nadministration are clearly more\ndisturbed by this protest than they\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on\nbehalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit.

    "content": "Reviews FELIX, Friday January 30th19879 Philip Barry's \"Holiday\" is a very\ncurious play to be revived in\nLondon. It belongs to an almost\nextinct genre: the comedy of\nmanners or alternatively, 'scenes\nfrom an upper-class drawing room'.\nThis type of play once occupied\nevery stage on Broadway and in\nLondon but is hardly fashionable\ntoday.\nYet at the Old Vic we find a cast\ncontaining some very famous faces\nwhich would indicate a certain\nseriousness to the venture. What\nhappens is disappointing.\nImagine yourself as an observer for\na night in a road in the North of\nEngland, suffering under the impact\nof total unemployment. You catch\nglimpses of people's lives as scenes\nappear then melt away, hear their\nconversation, witness their\nrelationships, lives and even deaths.\nThey cover all their disillusionment,\nhopelessness and sadness with a poignant, painful sadness. You are\ninvolved; they speak to you, scream\nat you and even dance at you. but you\nare free to move away.\n\"Road\" at the Royal Court (until\n28th February) allows you to become\na fly-on-the-wall for an evening. It is\ntotal theatrical escapism, the action\ncontinues even during the interval in\nthe audience, whilst in the theatre's real bar, we are entertained by the\ncabaret acts from the pub on the road,\none of which is a song from Ian Dury.\nAll aspects of the production fit\ntogether and work perfectly, however\n\"Road\" gains extra lift from the\ngenuine enjoyment the actors get from\nperforming to and interacting with the\naudience, to whom their enthusiasm\nis quickly transmitted.\n\"Road\" has been described as the\nmost significant and original new\nEnglish play for a long time. It is\nthoroughly enjoyable and satisfying,\nand totally unmissable!\nThe plot is an old clich e containing a rich, established\nAmerican family and the\nunconventional bright young man\nwho arrives to marry the eldest\ndaughter, but has a profound effect\non the whole household,\nparticularly the rebellious younger\nsister.\nWhat happens is painfully\npredictable - there is no element of\nintrigue. Neither do we find much in\nthe way of interesting characters -they are all stereotypes, after all this\nis a comedy of manners.\nBut where we should find\nabundant observations on the\nfoibles of the rich and social\nhierarchy we find but few. A few\npleasing mordant one-liners\nperhaps, but on the whole nothing\nreally happening. The humour\ninvolved is of course very subtle,\nintelligent humour and I think the\nOld Vic fails here as a venue because\nits cavernous stage does not allow\nthe intimacy subtle humourous\ninterplay requires.\nYet there were performances\nfrom some of the actors that could\nhave sparked off greater things on a different night or at a different\nplace. Mary Steenburgen brought\ngreat impetuous ness, high spirits\nand a caustic wit to the young sister,\nwho yearns for the freedom and\nhappiness her 5th Avenue mansion\ndoes not allow. Frank Grimes was\nexcellent as the brother who finds\nsolace in alcoholism. In a tame\nproduction they stood out. Malcom\nMcDowell was the most\ndisappointing actor. He is supposed\nto be the breath of life who sweeps\ninto the staid household, but he does\nnot convey this. I expected more\nfrom him.\n'Holiday' is hardly Tenessee\nWilliams - not drama. There is a little of Scott Fitzgerald in the\ninclination of the run towards\ndisillusion and the breathless desire\nfor youth, fun and party. But this is\nreally Philip Barry, a man\nsimultaneously repelled by the rich\nand compelled to live amongst\nthem. His characters display the\npersonal and moral confusions of\nthe age (the 20's) and see freedom\nlying far away from wealth and\nsocial status and equally far away\nfrom poverty. One doubts they will\never find. it.\nI would not write this play off. A fortnight may transform it for the\nbetter and the light story is not\naltogether un please nt as an\nalternative to full-blooded British\nfarce. But it's very existence in\nLondon seems curious.\n\n"

Like similar smart-arse s of that time he was hoping to join\nPythagoras' Brotherhood of ascetics,\nwho spent their time contemplating\nobscure mathematical concepts.\nAccordingly he was given an\ninterview by the infamous\nPythagoras.\n\"You're aware of my latest\ntheorem?\" Asked Pythagoras.\n\"You mean that which relates the\nareas formed by squares on the sides\nof the right triangle?\" Said Grapy,\nwho'd done his homework.\n\"Yes, can you tell me what it is?\"\nGrapyathos, who always read his\nAncient Greek Mathematica Weekly,\nanswered without hesitation.\n\"It states: the sum of the areas\nformed by squares on the two short\nsides of the right triangle equals the\narea of the square on the longest\nside.\"\n\"Very good,\" said Pythagoras,\nyou'll see that here I 've written out\na few whole number sol uti ions! He pointed to a patch of ground\nwhere he had scratched out the\nfollowing.\n3 4 5\n6 8 10\n7 24 25\n\"Notice that in every case one of\nthe numbers is a multiple of 5!\"\n\" A coincidence?\" offered\nGrapyathos.\n\"If you were aware of our\nteachings that the universe is merely\na manifestation of mathematical\nrelationships, you'd know that there\nis no such thing as coincidence. In fact\nit is true in every single case that one\nof the numbers is divisible by five,\nand I want you to prove it!\"\nGrapyathos was puzzled, but then\nrealised that it was actually very easy\nto prove. How?\n\u00a35 prize money for a randomly\nselected correct entry handed in at the\nFELIX office by 1.00pm Wednesday.\nMore groping\u2014solution\nOK, so my description did not rule\nout cutting the orchard into 8 strips-sorry. You all got the gist of what I wanted, though, with the following 4\npiece solution:\nThe winner of the \u00a35 prize was Paul\nClaydon, Aero 4, well done. Please\ncollect your prize after 1.00pm on\nMonday. Thanks to those of you who\nentered new problems and triangle\n(alright, it's not impossible)\ndrawings.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday January 30th1987 When people announce that they are\nto stand for Union posts tongues start\nto wag. It seems that Dave Tyler and\nChris Simpson are to go for the dream\nticket of Guilds President and VicePresident of Guilds Union. However\na less than kindly soul has already'\ncome up with their election slogan:\n\"Two head, one brain.\"\nOver a period of weeks a number\nof tales have reached this office of one\n\"Joe 90\" of Mech Eng and Motor\nClub fame. Apparently our Joe is\nquite keen on being a media superstar,\nso here goes.\nJoe, after a long session in\nSouthside (the bar, not the gym),\nwho, deciding that he needed\nsomewhere to sleep, went off to find\nthe flat of some friends. The only\nproblem with this was that he could\nremember the road they lived in but\nnot the number of the house. After\nreaching the right road he decided that\nthe best way to find his friends is to\ngo along the street knocking on each\ndoor and asking if Imperial College\nstudents live there. Trying a number\nof houses he eventually comes across\nnumber 52. He rings the basement\nfirst, thus endearing himself and the\nstudents living upstairs to them\nevermore. As luck would have it this\nflat is the right one. However Joe 90\nis probably now the most unpopular\nperson in a certain part of West\nLondon.\nTalking of Joe 90, it just so happens\nthat his lab partner, Bill Goodwin,\nfound himself enmeshed in a \"little\nmisunderstanding\", or more to the\npoint, thought he was, whilst at the\nNUS Conference in December. Not\nwanting to break the bank he and\nChris Martin decided to stay at a friend's hotel.\nThey took a double room with two\nsingle beds, however Chris, not\nwanting to put the hotel staff out,\ndecided to spend the first night in his\nsleeping bag rather than have the staff\nmake up his bed. The cleaner was\nrather suspicious the next morning\nwhen she found that one bed had not\nbeen slept in. She gave Bill a knowing\nlook and left. Bill instantly suspected\nthat she suspected that something was\nafoot, leapt to the defensive and\nexplained that Chris had slept in his\nsleeping bag, which had been\ncarefully packed. The cleaner\nnodded, trying to suppress a smirk,\nand left!\nBill, worried about his flagging\nimage with the cleaning staff, then\ntried to explain to Chris that he should\nsleep in his bed the next night.\nHowever Chris thought this was a stupid idea and proceeded to do the\nsame thing again, leaving an\nincredibly e mbar assed Bill to face the\nmusic with the cleaner next day, who\nin a state of extreme panic did his best\nto mess up the other bed to avoid\nfurther em baras s ment. Which conveniently leads us on to\nem baras s ment of the do-it-yourself\nvariety. Responding to the plea to\nbuild a small wooden wine-rack the\nintrepid threesome of Chas Jackson,\nAlan Clarke and an individual known\nonly by the name 'Mole' decided to\n'Tyler and Simmo: Buddy can you spare a brain?\n'Peter Wilson and friends relax after a long recording session. \"\ngo into the construction business.\nDespite full instructions being\nsupplied with the kit, they decided\nthat they had a better idea. Rather than\nbuild the thing square, as suggested,\nthey went for a triangular design.\nSounds fine until you consider that\nthey meant an inverted triangle. They\nwere even more pleased when they\nfound that they had several bits of\ndowelling left over. Chas was so over\nthe moon that he decided to try his\nhand at sculpture and created a model\nby banging the dowels into an old\nlump of wood. Thus satisfied the trio\nwent off to scare some old ladies, in\nthe way that young delinquents do,\nleaving the recipient of the wine rack\ntoo scared to remove any bottles from\nit in case the whole thing fell apart.\nChas Jackson will be holding an\nexhibition of dowel sculpture in the\nConsort Gallery next term.\nIt was red faces all round in the\nRapide coach from Sheffield the other\nday as Pete Wilson wondered what\nthe little paper bags were for pinned\nto the back of the seat in front.\nApparently they are for putting litter\nand various fag ends in.-However it\nhad been a good party up in the\nNorth, and Peter was not feeling very\nwell. He decided that the best way out\nof the potentially disastrous st it u at ions was to use the paper bag.\nUnfortunately Pete soon discovered\nthat the bags are not completely\nwatertight.\nThe early shutdown of IC Radio\nafter a problematical outside\n.broadcast from the Hole in the Hall\nbar in Falmouth-Keogh Hall caused\nseveral people to lose their beauty\nsleep in the late hours of Tuesday\nnight. Rolling home after a good\nnight's boozing at ULU, our intrepid\nExternal Affairs Officer, who shall\nremain nameless for fear of his safety,\ndecided to investigate the situation.\nHe first rang IC Radio but\nun surprisingly got no answer, and\ninstead tried Pete Hands. Fortunately\nfor Mr. Hands, he was out at the time.\nIncensed by his lack of answers,\nour EAO decided that he would ask\nthe members of the Union Finance\nCommittee what they thought of this\npoor value for money that IC Radio\nwas offering. He started with Duncan\nRoyle, who was suitably unimpressed\nwith being woken up at one o 'clock\non a Wednesday morning.\nUnfortunately r 'ost of his comments\non the subject were unfit for printing,\nexcept for the remarkably perceptive\nquestion \"Are you pissed?\"\nHaving got some juicy quotes from\nMr. Royle, he proceeded to try and\nask the rest of UFC whether they\nthought that IC Radio's grant should\nbe slashed. However, by a curious\ncoincidence all the rest of the\ncommittee set ned to be elsewhere,\nand so he was forced to ring a random\nstaircase in Linstead to find out the\nresidents' opinions. The only saving\ngrace of this approach was that the\nLinstead people on the other end of\nthe line were more pissed than our\nprotagonist.\nSo if you get a phone call on your\nstaircase in the early hours of the\nmorning, you know it's just market\nresearch.\n\n"

FELIX, Friday January 30th198712 Go, and wine Ales\nThere was a good turnout last Friday\nto hear the Head Brewer from Gales\nBrewery give an informal talk to\nmembers of the society. Discussion\nranged from the beers and lagers on\nDue to the overwhelming response\nfrom our last little ditty in this\nesteemed rag we have decided to\nmake the trek to Maths 341 a little\nmore enticing than merely knowing\nabout the great games played in this\nroom during Tuesday and Wednesday\nlunchtimes (viz Hsiangchi and Go).\nYes, we've spared no expense to lay\non a special cheese & wine party on\nWednesday February 4th starting at\n1.00pm in Maths 341. Just to\ncomplete the party atmosphere we'll\nintroduce new people to the games\nplayed by the club, which, in case you\nmissed the last instalment, are\nstrategy-war games for two players.\nHsiangchi is similar to chess, and Go\nisn't! Unlike most strategy games, these\ntwo are easy to learn, so don't be put\noff by the thought of spending hours\nlearning rules\u2014you'll be playing from\nscratch within ten minutes, and while\nI'm on the subject of being put off,\nour club name has caused a little\nconfusion: the word 'Chinese' refers\nto the brand of chess played, and not\nwhat you have to be in order to join!\nSo come along on the 4th and find out\nhow to play two of the most\nfascinating games in the world. See\nyou there.\nSFSoc flights of fancy\nthe market today, their histories, and\nthoughts about the future of the\nindustry, to pigs getting pissed every\nThursday on fermented by-products\nof the brewing process. There was a chance to discuss the possibility of a career in brewing for those interested.\nOur next meeting is on Thursday\n6th February, and there are also\nspaces on some of the brewery trips\nwe have organised for this term.\nColin Trotman (Mech Eng)\nI hurriedly pushed my way through\nthe market crowds seeking the tiny\nbooth on the far side. The odour of\na thousand unwashed bodies assailed\nmy nostrils, and the shouting of\ncustomers and stall owners drowned\nout the meaning of their words. It was\nnot long until the market closed for\nthe night, and already many people\nwere heading for the exits, so much\nso that I was fighting against the tide\nof humanity driving me away from\nmy destination. I received several\nbruises and crushed toes in my\nsearch, but I was sure I gave as many\ninjuries as I got.\nFinally, scant minutes before the\nmarket was due to be cleared of\ncustomers by the palace guard, I saw\nmy destination in front of me. That\ntiny little tent made from what seemed\nto be an ancient tapestry, with the\nfaded images of heraldic beasts\nsporting in a verdant landscape. I went to the entrance and stepped\nthrough the beaded doorway into the\ndimly lit interior.\nThe difference between the outside\nand the inside of the booth always\nastounded me. Was it the lighting that\nmade the inside seem larger, the\ntapestries brighter in colour and not\nso decrepit with age, or because the\ninterior was simply better cared for?\nI always got the feeling that neither\nof these explanations was true.\nThe sole occupant of the booth\nlooked up at me from her table. The\nblind milky eyes of the old hag looked\nstraight into my face. \"So you have\nreturned. Have you the money this\ntime?\"\n\"Yes,\" I replied, placing the\nleather purse I had been carrying on\nthe table. The woman picked it up and\nweighed the contents in her hand.\n\"You have done well. This is\nalmost twice what I asked for.\"\n\"You don't ask how much a man\nis carrying when you cut his purse,\"\nI replied.\n\"That is true. Now sit and I will\ntell you what you would know.\" I did\nas I was told. \"I have conducted\nmany readings for you since I knew\nyou would bring me the money. You\nwill go to the great magician Enas\nYorl, who will send you on your way.\nYou will travel to a great seat of\nlearning, via a most mysterious\njourney on which his magic will send\nyou. There you will join with a great\nconspiracy, and on a most significant\ndate many will gather at one place\nwhere the Meaning of Life will be\nrevealed to all. I have prepared this\nparchment for you with many details\nof your trip. Do not lose it, for it\nholds your very fate within its secrets.\nNow go to the Old City, where Enas\nYorl is expecting you.\" I grasped the\nroll of parchment and left the tent.\nAnd so I came to be here, seated\nin this great hall with so many others\nabout to have revealed to us the real\nMeaning of Life. The lights dimmed\nand a great series of visions formed\nbefore my eyes. Truly this could not\nbe the secret itself?\nStrangely un edif ed,I left the hall\nmany hours later and consulted the\nfortune teller's parchment, my only\ncompanion on my long and tortuous\njourney.\nThe mystic runes seemed to glow\non the page as I read them...\n\"ICSF in association with QTSoc\nand WellSoc present a film evening\nin Physics LT1 on Monday 2nd February at 6.30pm The films will be Dougal and the\nBlue Cat, the only full length Magic\nRoundabout film ever made, and\nMonty Python'S The Meaning of Life.\nEntrance is free to members of the 3\nsocieties, and \u00a31 to non-members.\"\nThese words seemed of obvious\nmeaning to me, so the last few\nsyllables must contain the reason for\nmy mistake, and I was still pondering\ntheir meaning as I read them...\n\"Time for bed\" said Zebedee,\n\"Boinnnggg\"\nRobert Lynn Anadin\nEnviroweek\nThe EEC has designated March 21st1987 as the beginning of the\n'European Year of the Environment' (EYE).\nThe community's aim is to 'raise\nawareness of the environment and\nto provide environmental projects\nwhich will have lasting effects.\nIn response to this large scale\ninternational initiative several\nsocieties within the college are\nworking together to hold an\n'Enviroweek' between March 2nd and 6th this year.\nThe aims of the week are similar\nto those of EYE; to raise awareness\nin a college where much of the\nteaching and research carried out is\nconnected, directly or indirectly,\nwith the environment.

    "content": "F^ ELIX! FELIX. Friday January 30th19874 Bad planning\nat Evelyn\nview over the matter, I don't think\nthis is a reasonable solution. The\nimportant grievances to the Union\nseem to be the loss of space in the\nJCR, the loss of revenue through\nletting out the JCR in the summer and;\nthe fact that the College refectory\nservice doesn't clear up the mess it\nproduces. Surely any reasonable\nperson would aim for these\nconsequences of the College'sun thoughtful judgements to be cleared\nup, eg. by boycotting the bar in order\nto ensure the seating area for the QT\nbar is not installed, to gain\nre compensation for the summer losses\nand to get a clearing-up service. Why\non earth does the fact the College\ninstalls a new profitable refectory\nservice give the Union the right to\ntake it over? It seems to me the\nCollege refectory service is\nimproving and that it is still striving\nto do so. If, every time it installs a new service which is profitable, the\nUnion take it over what incentive does.\nit leave the refectory service to\ncontinue improving?\nThis, what I believe to be an error\nin the Union's judgement, seems to\nhave arisen from many bad feelings\nbetween the College Secretary and the\nUnion Executive. I don't believe that\nthere are good reasons for these bad1 feelings, but this shouldn't cloud the\njudgement of an important issue, i Meanwhile, many people are getting\nfed up with feeling obliged not to eat j from the QT bar, and drinking poor j coffee for the same price as the\nexcellent coffee from the newly\ninstalled coffee machines. With the\nUnion demands as they stand at the\nmoment, this dispute looks like it will,\nrim for a very long time.\nYours sincerely\nAndrew M Holt (EE2)\nRICKY'S GARAGE\n(Personal service guaranteed)\n19 QUEENS GATE PLACE\nMEWS\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel: 01 581 1589\nDear Dave,\nI am writing in order to provide a student's eye view of the proposed\nchanges to Evelyn Gardens. The first\nchange is to let-out the Gardens in\norder to generate some money for\nmore halls. Although this seems like\na good idea in theory, it means the\nmoving-out of all students from their\nrooms, and provides the interesting\nquestion of security; even if the\nallocated storerooms have deadlocks\nfitted, the door-frames, windows and\nbalconies are readily accessible and\nhardly of Fort-Knox standard. The\nattic, certainly in Bernard Sunley, can\nbe filled with the contents of one\ndouble room. Clearly, this needs\nmuch more thought. Who knows?\nCollege may even consider asking (or\ntelling) the residents.\nA second point, much more\nsweeping than the first, is the\nproposed cutting back of the ReApps. As a fresher, I appreciated the\nefforts of the Re-Apps to acc lim at is e us to London. This included\nrecommending various pubs, shops,\nwhere to go and what to do at IC, and\nhow to actually find your way about\nLondon. As a fresher, I can\nappreciate these efforts on my behalf.\nAs a Re-App, I can appreciate the\nhard work that we sometimes have to\ndo in order to organise such events\nas ARBS, competitions, etc. In\naddition, students must be shown\naround the local area: half of the first\nweek went towards this. In summary,\nif College has any desire to keep our\nunique attitude of giving Freshers an\nidea of what there is to do around\nLondon and IC, it would seem more\nreasonable to keep the proportion of\nRe-Apps roughly constant, or tell\nprospective Re-Apps exactly how\nmuch work they will have to do.-And\nthen, of course, try to work out why\nthere are no applicants.\nYours Sincerely,\nIan Baker,\nMech. Eng. 2.\nBOYCOTT SUCCESS\nThe boycott of the 'QT' snack bar has\nbeen a resounding success. The\nstudents of this college have made\ntheir feelings over the control of the\nJunior Common Room absolutely\nclear. The Union Executive can now\nnegotiate with College knowing that\nyou are behind us.\nThe boycott will cease from\n4.30pm this evening. It was never\nintended to do permanent damage, but\nit was necessary to show that we have\nyour support. College must now listen\nto the student viewpoint.\nOn Wednesday, notices signed by\nthe Refectory Manager (Mr. Northey)\nappeared in the Junior Common\nRoom. These implied that, during the\nfirst two days of the picket, 'QT' staff\nand customers had been \"harassed\"\nby students pickett ing the burger bar.\nWe believe that this is not the case,\nand have had no complaints about the\nconduct of the pickets. In fact the\npickets were polite and friendly to\nboth staff and students throughout the\nboycott.\nWe would like to thank everybody\nwho helped to organise the boycott\nand all those, students and staff, who\nsupported the Student Union by\nstaying away from 'QT'. Special\nthanks are due to all the Union\npermanent staff for their enthusiasm\nand all the extra work they have put\nin this week.\nJCR REFURBISHMENT\nWork started on Wednesday on the\nrefurbishment of the Junior Common\nRoom. This involves total\nre decoration, the installation of a moveable partition, and a new ceiling\nand lights. Approximately half the\nJCR space will be cordon ned off until\nMarch 15th when all work should be\ncomplete. There will be access to the\nremainder of the JCR and the buttery\narea at all times. Events which had\nbeen booked into the JCR will be\nrehoused, probably in the main\nDining Hall. If this is likely to cause\nyour club problems, see Jackie Pierce\nas soon as possible.\nThis work, which is being financed\nby College, is part of long-term\nrefurbishment plans.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nNorthey burgers off\nThe QT Burger Bar was closed for the latter half of this week\nafter a boycott by IC Union reduced trade in the JCR to a greatly reduced level. The boycott was called at last Friday's Extraordinary General Meeting at which the ICU Executive\nwere instructed to organise a peaceful picket of QT. Very few\nstudents or staff chose to cross the picket lines, and after\noperating at a significant loss on Monday and Tuesday, the\nBurger Bar was closed until further notice. The boycott will\nfinish at 4.30pm today, and it is anticipated that QT will open\nas usual on Monday.\nThe Extraordinary General\nMeeting, convened specifically to\ndiscuss the JCR issue, was attended\nby the Rector, Professor Ash, and\nCollege Secretary, John Smith, who\nput forward the College's case to the\n400 students who were present. Mr\nSmith said that the College had not\nexpected QT to be such a popular\noutlet, and that, on shelving the\noriginal plans for the switch of the\nJCR and the Sherfield Refectory, they\nwere simply trying to find a solution\nto the space problem. There were now\ntoo many people using the refectory\nsystem for the switch to go ahead.\nThere was no longer, he said, enough\nroom on the second floor of Sherfield\nto accommodate everyone who used\nthe Refectory services at lunchtime.\nIC Union officers, and several\nspeakers from the floor, argued that\nthe College had broken the agreement\nto go through with the switch of\nrooms. The QT Burger Bar was now\noperating in a Union-controlled room,\nbut the Union was not benefitting\nfrom the significant profits QT was\nmaking. Professor Ash replied that\nprofits were ploughed back into the\nrefectory system, and were used to\nimprove the services provided. He\nstressed that the space demands of the\nrefectories was a community\nproblem, an argument which has been\nused by College administration\nconstantly since the issue arose. There\nwere also questions about the\nfinancial loss to ICU if conference\nbookings were reduced, though Mr\nSmith assured the meeting that this\nwould be made up with an increased\nsub vent ion.A motion was tabled from the floor,\ncalling for ICU to press for a Union\ntakeover of QT, and, to this end\norganise a boycott as a demonstration\nof student feeling. The motion was\ncarried by a vote of about 2:1.\nSince the boycott began on Monday\nstudents have been pickett ing QT, and\nthe Union has been running an\n' 'Alternative Snack Bar'' in the JCR.\nICU President, Christine Taig, said\nthat there had been a very good\nresponse to the Union's call for\nvolunteers, though she was\ndisappointed by the number of\nCouncil members who had turned\nout.\nAfter two days of unsuccessful\ntrading, a notice was placed outside\nQT announcing that the Burger Bar\nwould be closing until further notice\nto prevent \"further harassment of\ncatering staff and customers, and\nwastage of materials.\" Ms Taig wrote\nto the College Secretary on\nWednesday, informing him that the\nboycott would cease on Friday, and\nexpressing surprise that Mr Northey,\nthe College Refectory Manager, had\ncomplained about harassment of his\nstaff. Mr Northey was reluctant to\ntalk to FELIX when he was\napproached on Wednesday, but did\nsay that he was not directly\nresponsible for the notice. The\ndecision to close QT had been made\nat a higher level within the\nadministration, he added. Mr Northey\nagreed that the boycott had been\n\"successful,\" but said that the\n\"losers are the students\" since the\nboycott reduced profits from QT,\nwhich would have been ploughed\nback into the refectory system. Mr\nNorthey also questioned whether the\nboycott had been aimed at QT only,\nsince the Union's leaflets had not\nmentioned the other College refectory\noutlets under the heading \"where to\neat during the boycott.\"\nIn a letter to Ms Taig the College\nSecretary said that the success of QT\n\"indicates the commit t ment to\nRefectory refurbishment.\" He also\nmakes the point that QT has brought\nChristine Taig and Jackie Peirce boycotting QT\nstudents back into the JCR, which had\nnot previously been properly used.\nOn Wednesday work began on the\nrefurbishment of the JCR. This will\ninclude fitting a moveable partition\nwhich will separate QT from the rest\nof the JCR. At a meeting of ICU\nExecutive last Saturday it was decided\nnot to oppose the commencement of\nthe refurbishment, since the EGM had\nnot decided to press College to\ncp mp let e the original switch of JCR\nand Main Dining Hall. Ms Taig told\nFELIX that she was not happy that the\nwork was going ahead during term\ntime, but added that it would be to the\nlong term advantage of the students.\nThe Union Executive met with Mr\nSmith and a number of other senior\nCollege administration staff yesterday\nafternoon to discuss a settlement to\nthe dispute. Ms Taig described the\nnegotiations as \"very amicable\" and\nsaid that she expected to have written\nproposals some'' ne next week.\nIn the meantime College are to\nconsult further with the Academic\nStaff Association over plans for the\nSenior Common Room. The ASA is\nto poll its members on their opinions\nand may not have a result before the\nend of February.\na*6 ff ard currie rs',a rd wastage cf\nFree Friday January 30th1987 No. 761\n\n"

Our newsletter\n'Scraps' will be appearing shortly and\nwill contain this timetable and more\nbesides.\nIn the drink\nThe first match of term started when\nwe had to drag one of the team\nmembers, Adam Stork, out of bed\nbefore proceeding on our way to\nQueen Mary's Reservoir to sail\nagainst \"City.\"\nWe arrived there to find fog and\nvery little wind, but after a quick cup\nof coffee, while we surveyed the\nsituation, we decided to brave the\nelements, or lack of them!\nDuring the first race Charles Oxley\nthought it would be a good tactic to\ncapsize on top of a buoy (lucky boy!),\ngo for a swim and half drown one of\nthe opposition. Despite the disastrous\nstart, better known as lulling the\nopposition into a false sense of\nsecurity, the IC team went on to win\nan astounding race with an excellent\n1st,2 nd,3 rd finish leaving City\nwading behind in 4th,5 th,6 th place.\n\u2022 The next race was extremely close\nwith Adam Stork and Jenny Highgate\nchasing the first boat while Richard\nBrimelow and Sam Page slowed\ndown to help Charles Oxley through,\nwho then proceeded to stop a City\nboat from finishing for ten minutes\nafter the other boats had finished.\nDuring this time the other boats\nadjourned to the bar to watch the end\nof the race\u2014closely followed by the\ncrew!\nJust rewards\nScored\nAfter a win and a draw in early term\nfriendlies, the 1st XI returned to\ncompetitive hockey last Wednesday\nagainst Charing Cross/Westminster\non Paddington astroturf. IC took the\nlead when Paul Coleman converted a short corner early in the game. This\nwas swiftly followed by Dave\nJennings scoring a second after a goal mouth scramble. Further pressure\nin the first half failed to produce any\nmore goals, although there was a good case for a penalty flick award\nwhen the ball struck a defender's foot\non the goal line. Midway through the\nsecond half, Jon Stonham burst\nthrough from defence and left with\nonly the goalkeeper to beat, slipped\nit just inside the post. Paul Henharon\nthen drew on his many years of\nexperience to round the keeper for the\nfourth goal to leave the final score at\n4-0.\nOn Saturday, in the Middlesex\nLeague, we travelled to Brunei\nUniversity. A somewhat late\ndeparture resulted in the team having\nto change on the Tube much to the\nshock and amusement of some\npassengers. The late start did not\nprevent us taking the lead through\nPaul Skipworth with a cool y taken\ngoal on reverse stick. Brunei replied\nalmost immediately with a shot that\ngave birthday boy Phil Choudhury no\nchance. The loss of Phil Oliver at half\ntime with a shoulder injury resulted\nin a tactical reshuffle; however, Hari\nscored a well-taken goal to restore the\nlead. The play then became rather\nscrappy although Brendan Farmer had\ntwo good chances to wrap the game\nup. Brunei piled on the pressure in the\nclosing stages but the defence, Phil\nChoudhury in particular, held out\nwell to leave IC with the points.\nIC 4 : Charing Cross/\nWestminster Hosp 0\nBrunei 1 : IC 2\nLondon Hospital II 0 : IC II 1\nOpportunism by Scott Gordon in the\n87th minute brought an expression of\ndelight to this IC team, as his header\nfound the back of the net. For IC it\nbrought a fine conclusion to an\nexcellent, hard fought game of\nfootball.\nHowever, the game started poorly\nfor IC, who were fielding 4 players.\nMaking their debut for the II's, viz\nHolroyd, Robinson, Poppy and\nBroelhuizen. London Hospital passed\nthe ball around gracefully in the\nopening 20 minutes and a couple of\nchances were squandered. As the\ngame wore on, the IC midfield of\nKeelin, Adams and co became more\ninvolved. Keelin's free-kick found the\nhead of Gordon and an.excellent save\nwas required from the London\nHospital keeper. Good work by\nKeelin and Poppy led to a Keelin\ncross being met '.superbly by Phil\nAdams, whose effort deserved more\nthan the rattle of the post.\nAt half-time IC reckoned\nthemselves to have taken the upper\nhand in the game. Yet once again\nLondon Hospital looked dangerous in\nthe opening moments of the half. IC\nbattled on with Holland and Caverick\n(the IC centre backs) endorsing \"no-nonsense\" tactics. The game became\na spectacle of end-to-end action\n(where were the cameras?) and a mistake by anyone could have proved\ncostly. John Wreford, who gave\nanother excel ler.. performance in the\nIC goal, made such a mistake when\nhe missed a relatively simple cross.\nA London Hospital goal looked\ncertain as the shot headed towards the\nempty goal. But Barrow the IC\nskipper was on hand to make a dramatic clearance three inches from\nthe line, thus saving the day once\nmore for IC. The battle wore on and\nboth teams looked tired, only London\nHospital more so. Fine work by the\nmidfield gave Poppy the opportunity\nto cross. Broelhuizen harassed the\ndefence enough for the miscued\nclearance to fall to Adams whose\nexcellent effort was again foiled by\nthe keeper. Keelin came blistering\nthrough and his follow up shot was\ndeflected to Gordon who duly headed\nhome. Just rewards for a fine effort\nby this makeshift side.\n\n"

    "content": "News FELIX, Friday January 30th198716 Brittan's better Britain\nMr. Leon Brittan, Conservative MP\nfor Richmond in Yorkshire, spoke to\nIC Conservative Society on Tuesday.\nMr. Brittan explained on why he\nfeels that the fortunes of the\nConservative party are considerably\nbetter now than they were a year ago.\nAlthough the chief reason was that\n\"We have shown a determination to\nseize the initiative\", he also said that\nthe party listened to its supporters,\nand cited as an \"un covenanted bonus'' the ability of the other parties\nto score own goals.\nIn reference to the major\nachievements of the Government, Mr.\nBrittan said that the new focus on\nstandards in education shows \"a readiness to deal with difficult\nproblems,\" and that it is important for\nthe Government to tackle the major\nissues facing the country.\nOn inflation, he said that it was not\npossible to over-estimate the\nachievements that the Government\nhad made, and told his audience that\nbattling against inflation is the most\neffective way of ensuring stable\ngrowth and job prospects for the\nfuture. The effectiveness of this policy\nwas, he said, proved by the fact that,\nalthough many jobs have been lost,\nmore have been created in this\ncountry since 1983 than in any other\nEuropean country.\nIn order to create \"one nation\" it\nwas, said Mr. Brittan, necessary to\nextend the range of home and share\nownership. He felt that this was of\n\"profound significance,\" and\nreferring specifically to home\nownership said that to pass from a private housing estate to a council one\nwas \"Division writ large in bricks\nand mortar.\" This monolithic\ndivision could only be overcome by\nthe policy of selling council houses\nto their occupants. Questioned from\nthe floor, he replied that housing stock\nwas not lost through such selling, as\nonly about 3 % of the stock becomes\nvacant each year.\nMr. Brittan was also questioned\nabout the recent ban imposed upon an\narticle in the New Statesman, and said\nthat \"There will be certain things that\nhave to be kept secret.\" It was, he\nasserted, in the interest of the country\nas a whole that such information was\nnot made public. It was suggested by\nanother questioner that, this being the\ncase, action should have been taken\nwhen the idea for the BBC television\nprogramme was first put forward.\nMr. Brittan countered that although\nthe Government does take security\nmatters seriously, it did not wish to\nbe premature, and gave consideration\nto the freedom of the press.\nWhen questioned on the\nGovernment view of student loans,\nMr. Brittan said that he felt that it was\nreasonable to look at the option, and\npointed out that Britain is the only\ncountry with a supportive grant\nsystem. With a larger than ever\nnumber of students in higher\neducation, it was necessary, he\nconcluded, to examine the alternatives\nto the present system.\nRe-apps cut by 50%\nOne hundred and fifty more places in\nstudent ac como dati on must be found\nif next year's planned 20%\nundergraduate increase is to be\nachieved, according to the Student\nResidence Committee, which met last\nWednesday. The extra students are\nneeded if the College is to receive the\nmaximum grant from the UGC.\nOverseas students, who pay higher\nfees, are expected to be encouraged,\nalthough this would increase the\nburden on College ac como dati on. It was decided by a majority, with\nall the students present abstaining, to\nreduce the 106 re-app places by 50%\nnext year, though it is intended to\nrestore the lost places when a new\nresidence is found. All wardens agree\nthat the re-apps are needed, but in\nview of the acute ac como dati on shortage at the start of this year,\nurgent measures must be taken if the\nCollege is to maintain its guarantee\nof residence to first year students.\nKen Young, Warden of Southwell\nHouse, said that he feels that cutting\nthe number of re-app places will cause\na drop in the level of service to\nstudents, with the houses becoming\nmore like lodgings. Re-apps are, he\ntold FELIX, vital in helping fresher s to settle in, and cutting the number\nof places to the point where there is\nonly a1 in 8 chance of succeeding\nwill dissuade people from applying.\nThe action, which was proposed by\nCollege Assistant Secretary,Michael\nArthur, is just a way of putting off the\nday when a new residence has to be\nfound, said Mr. Young.\nUnion President Christine Taig said\nthat the move was \" A desperate\nmeasure.\" She told FELIX that the\nCollege were cutting off their nose to\nspite their face, and said that the\naction shows that not enough effort\nis being put into finding new\naccommodation.\nThe College is still looking at new\nproperty in the area but, in order to\nbuy any new ac como dati on, rents\nmay have to be increased\nsignificantly, to the point where they\nare comparable with the private\nsector. Some students have suggested\nthat College should encourage\nben factors to help buy new property,\nperhaps in a sponsorship role, but this\nsuggestion has not as yet been taken\nup.\nSchrodinger's centenary\nImperial College will be leading the\ncelebrations of the centenary of Erwin\nSchrodinger's birth this year. A conference, featuring six Nobel prize-winners, is to be held at the College\nfrom March 31st to April 3rd. At the\nsame time a book containing\ncontributions from the speakers is to\nbe published entitled \"Schrodinger,\ncentenary celebrations of a polymath.\"\nSchrodinger was responsible for the\ndiscovery of wave machines in 1926,\nwhich revolutionised much of\ntheoretical science in the twentieth\ncentury, including cosmology, unified\nfield theories, theoretical chemistry\nand molecular biology. The speakers\nat the conference will include Stephen\nHawking of Cambridge and Linus\nPauling of California.\nPrams pushed\nfor ULU\nA total of twelve people turned up\nto the \"Push for UL U\" pram race on\nTuesday, with just four pairs taking\npart in the three legged pram race\naround the Queens Lawn. The first\nplace was taken by the team of\nAlastair Seymour and Grant Wood of\nElec Eng II, who won a case of Swan\nLager.\nICU President, Christine Taig, said\nthat further action in support of ULU\nmay be arranged some time in the\nfuture. The Day of Action was, she\nfelt, overshadowed by Imperial\nCollege Union's boycott of the QT\nBurger Bar.\nWriting\nCompetition\nThe Economist is offering a student\nthe chance of three months writing\nabout science and technology this\nSummer.\nStudents under 24 can apply by\nsending a600 word article suitable for\nthe science and technology section,\ntogether with an introductory letter\n(which should include an address and\ntelephone number where the student\ncan be contacted) to: The Business\nEditor (re Richard Casement\nInternship), The Economist, 25 St.\nJames' Street, London SW1A 1HG.

Pickets were\nmounted outside most of the\nthreatened services from about 10.30\nuntil half-past two. At the Department\nof Extra-Mural Studies, staff relieved\nthe student pickets and trade union\nrepresentatives were present on most\nof the picket lines.\nThe switchboard of the University\nGrants Committee was jammed for\ntwo hours in the afternoon by students\ncalling to complain about the\nproposed cut in central funding, and\nthe postcards signed at most of the\ncolleges will be delivered to the UGC.\nAlmost one hundred students sat in\nthe foyer of Senate House for about\nan hour, and the Fencing Club toured\nthe offices of the building, handing\nout campaign leaflets. UL U President, Jane Cannon, said that the\natmosphere was very friendly, and\nshe felt that some support had been\nwon from the staff at Senate House.\nIn the evening a small colleges\ndisco was held at the School of\nPharmacy, while Campaign Cocktails\nwere available in the ULU building.\nTalking to FELIX on Wednesday\nafternoon, Jane Cannon said \"I think\nit was brilliant. We let the UGC know\nwhat we were doing.\"\nAsked what the next stage of the\ncampaign is likely to be, Ms Cannon\nsaid that the University will probably\nmake a submission to the UGC\ncontesting the level of the cut, and\ntold FELIX that a picket of the UGC\nmay be organised. The best way for\nstudents to support the campaign was,\nshe said, to keep on signing things;\n\"If they've never signed anything\nbefore, sign this\" she said of the\npetition and postcard campaign.\nScience In Peril\nTom Quits\nUnion Welfare Officer, Tom MelliarSmith, has resigned his post. In a letter delivered to Union President,\nChristine Taig, yesterday afternoon\nhe cited academic pressure as his\nreason to quit. Mr Melliar-Smith is\nthe second non-sabbatical officer to\nresign this year. A replacement will\nbe elected at a UGM later this term,\nanyone interested in the job should\ncontact the Union office.\nNOTICE\nAs from Sunday February 1st FELIX photocopier\ncharges will be 3p for an A4 copy and\n6p for an A3 copy\nThere will be no extra charge for\ncoloured paper.\nThe 'Save British Science' campaign\nwas a year old last Thursday. To\nmark the occasion, an open letter was\nsent to Mr Kenneth Baker, the\nMinister responsible for Education\nand Science. In the letter, the SBS\noutlined their case for an increase in\nresearch funding of \u00a3100 million, and\nthe adoption of a strong policy on\nscience as a whole.\nProfessor Connerade of the Physics\ndepartment, a senior member of the\nSBS, explained that science in Britain\nwas presently deteriorating at every\nlevel. He said that 25% of secondary\nschool science teachers are\nunqualified to teach science, putting\noff would be scientists; of those\nstudents who go on to get a Science\nDegree, few are choosing to do\npostgraduate work in Britain. Fewer\nof those who do stay here are staying\nto do post-doc work. In Britain, it\nseems young scientists find that they\ncannot get the salaries, project\nfunding, promotion prospects or\nindustrial backing that they need,\nthus, said Professor Connerade, they\nmove to more sympathetic countries;\nin many cases the United States.\nNot only is this causing a 'brain\ndrain,' reducing the quality of the\nBritish scientific community, but the\nSBS claim that this in turn makes\nBritain a less attractive partner for\nEuropean collaboration. The\nEuropeans will only continue to fund\nBritish scientists if they feel that they\nhave something to offer.\nProfessor Connerade also\nexpressed his concern at the lack of\na coherent policy for science. Again\nhe cited the problems of trying to keep\ncollaboration with Europe at a high\nlevel. Without the stability that a definite policy on science would\nbring, Europeans will continue to see\ncollaboration with Britain as risky.\nThey wouldn't know, he claimed,\nwhether funding for any project was\npermanent, or subject to\ngovernmental whim. Without the\nEuropeans, the British would have\neven fewer research places in an\nalready underfunded area. The\nconsequences of this would be further\ndeterioration.\nProfessor Connerade felt that the\nsubject of science and education\nfunding was likely to be an important\nelection issue. The SBS campaign\nhopes to maintain pressure on the\ngovernment; they have already won\nover both the relevant Parliamentary\ncommittees and the House of Lords.\nFree student travel\nThe OCs helps to fund adventure travel.\nWell, where are you going this summer? South\nAmerican rain forests or South Coast near Dover?\nEither way, the chances are that you won't be very\nfar from the nearest OC member - a valuable\nsource of advice in any language.\nThe choice is yours, the know-how is ours.\nOCs: A very special link\nOld Students' Association Office, Room 303 Shelfield Building\nImperial College.

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday January 30th19878 own& Out in London\nWithin easy reach of Imperial,\nfrequented by millions of people\nevery year, and yet almost ignored by\nmost students, are the four great\nmuseums of South Kensington. The\nNatural History, Science, Geological\nand Victoria and Albert Museums are\nnot squeezed into this small area by\nchance. Nor does Imperial share this\nspace with them by chance. It was due\nto the efforts of Albert, Prince\nConsort, Queen Victoria's husband,\nwho purchased the space to be used\nfor great institutes of learning. The\narea remains crown property,\nwatched over by the far sighted\nGerman from his memorial in\nKensington Gardens.\nStudents of Science should not think\nthat a visit to these museums would\nbe like a bus man's holiday, or that a trip to the V and A would be of no\ninterest. All four museums are rich\ntreasure houses, even if government\nunder funding does mean that they\nhave changed very little over the\ncourse of several years. The great\nvariety of exhibits, and enjoyable\ninteractive displays, means that the\ndays of standing looking blankly at\ndisplay cases filled with stuffed\nanimals or random pieces of\nmachinery, with brief and\nuninteresting labels, are long since\ngone. True, they may still be found,\nbut for the most part they have been\nbanished to the more remote galleries,\nwhere only the adventurous will track\nthem down.\nThe Science Museum was\noriginally part of the V and A. which\nhoused the exhibits from The Great\nExhibition of 1851. It became a separate entity in 1909. The ground\nfloor of the museum has been\nextensively refurbished. The new\nSynopsis Gallery is a museum in its\nown right. The last 150 years of\nscience dominate the gallery. There\nare mini displays on the train,\ntelephone and wireless and many\nother technological advances that\nhave radically altered the world.\nTucked away on the top floor of the\nmuseum is one of its gems. The\nWellcome Museum of Medicine\ncontains not only a chamber of\nmedical horrors through the ages, but\nmodern advances as well. 'Mr\nGibson's Chemist Shop' is an\nimmaculately reproduced 1903\nchemists, full of patent medicines and\nVictoriana. In the basement of the\nmuseum is a perennial favourite, the\nChildren's Gallery, where a student\nmay while away the time playing with\nthe displays and indulging their\nchildish tendencies. The Science\nMuseum is probably the best of the\nfour museums, and well worth a visit.\nThe Natural History Museum\n(more correctly British Museum\n(Natural History)) is full of plundered\nspecimens from around the world, in\nthe same way as its mother museum.\nIt has recently overcome the dusty\ncabinets and stuffed animal image.\nThe human biology exhibition is\nexcellent. It is a marvellous guided\ntour around the body. The only thing\nwhich detracts from this is the small\nchildren sniggering at the 'naughty\nbits' at the beginning of the\nexhibition. Particulary good is the\nsection on perception, with some\ninteresting tests, which a sober headed\nstudent may just be able to complete.\nAnother revamped area is the\ndinosaur display. Gone are the bare\nbones, and in are reconstructed\ndinosaurs.\nThe recently cleansed Geological\nMuseum is sadly in need of a pepping\nup, but there's not really a lot you can\ndo with rocks. The newest and the\nbest exhibition is a5,000 million year\nhistory of the earth from a geological\nviewpoint. Highpoint of this is the\nEarthquake film show, watched from\na platform, which at the appropriate\nmoments bursts into shuddering life\nto simulate the great Alaska\nearthquake. This exhibition also\ncontains what is probably your only\nchance to get a look at the moon\nclose-to, in the form of a genuine\npiece of moon rock. Many of the\nother exhibits are best summed up as\ncolourful bits of rock, but many are\nentirely uninteresting pieces of rock.\nI'm sure the miners will love it.\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum\nis a hot ch pot ch of design history,\nfashion art and the like. It is another\ncollection of the booty of Empire.\nMuch of the layout is designed to\nshow you the objects and little more\ncan be said. The historical aspects of\ndesign which are displayed are of\nparticular note, and the museum\ncontains many bits of buildings\nlopped off whole for the exhibition.\nFabric and cloth design make for\ncolourful displays, as does the\nassorted and fascinating field of\ncommercial art. This is definitely a museum for those scientists with an\nartistic leaning, and I wouldn't pretend that it will hold interest for\nall.\nAll four museums are currently\nfree, although the V and A does have\nan optional donation system. If you\nput on a student scarf the likelihood\nis that they won't hassle you for a donation at the V and A, but if they\ndo, don't feel in the slightest obliged\nto cough up. However, minimum\ncharges are being introduced in April.\nUp until then, the museums offer a warm, dry, constructive way to while\naway a free afternoon without being\ntoo energetic.\nIt would be a shame to pass up the\nopportunity to make the most of them\nwhen they are so easily accessible.\nDavid Burns\n\n"

As\nusual Derek's habit of talking too\nmuch had got him into trouble. Last\nweek there had been a big meeting of\nall the citizens, who were very angry\nbecause John Secretary had built the\n\"Quite Tasty\" burger factory in the\nmiddle of their playground. Ms\nPlague and Mummylonglegs had been\narguing with Derek and John\nSecretary for weeks, but the only\nresult of all their complaining was for\nDerek to fall asleep and John\nSecretary to change the angle at which\nhe held his head. Ms Plague had\ncalled all the citizens together so that\nthey could all shout at Derek. Derek\nhad avoided all their questions very\ncarefully. Whenever one of the\ncitizens asked him something\ndifficult, such as what his job was, he.\nwould say \"that's a very good\nquestion, and I think that John\nSecretary would like to say something\nabout it.\" Then John Secretary would\nalways reply \"I think that what we\nhave to remember is that Arthur\nMichael buys his clothes from Marks\nand Spencer.\" Normally this worked\nvery well and all the citizens would\nlook confused and suck their thumbs,\nexcept for Minty, the citizen's Rug\nChairman who kept trying to do an\nimpression of Bruce Springsteen.\nUnfortunately, when one of the\ncitizens asked if anyone was going to\nclear up ?.ll the litter around the burger\nfactory, Derek decided to answer the\nquestion himself, and suggested that\nthere should be a cleaning rota on\nwhich he would take first turn. Now\nDerek felt especially silly because he\nwas clearing up litter from the\ncitizens' picnic, rather than from the\nburger factory. The citizens had\ndecided not to buy anything from the\n\"Quite Tasty\" factory until they were\nallowed to play in the factory\nthemselves. The citizens all thought\nthis was very fair since the factory\nwas in the middle of their playground.\nCheapskate's chief cook, McNorthey\nwas very cross, however. His burger\nfactory had been very successful and\nlots of citizens had bought burgers\nfrom him. Now he had nothing to do\nall day except sit in his office sulking.\nAt the same time, on the other side\nof Cheapskate, the new Rent\nCollector, Lesley Grievous Bodily\nHarm was sitting in her office licking\nlots of envelopes. She was sending all\nthe citizens \u00ab very useful piece of\npaper, which had lots of questions on\nit invented by Kettle and GMT, the\ncitizens' well feeling representative.\nLesley was pleased with her new job;\nnow she would be able to make sure\nthat even more of her friends would\nbe given rooms in Cheapskate's dormitories.\nElsewhere in Cheapskate, however,\nthe former Rent Collector, Dong, was\nfeeling sorry for himself. Dong had\nbeen banished to one of the Surefield\ndungeons by the Baron. He now had\na job playing space invaders all day\nin the Cheapskate Treasury, and after\nthree weeks of this he was beginning\nto think that it was rather boring. He\nwas even beginning to suspect that\nJohn Secretary had only wanted to\nstop him trying to do anything\nimportant. Dong sighed and carried\non playing space invaders; at least in\nthis job he didn't have to put up with\nArthur Michael poking his nose in all\nthe time. He decided to phone his\nfriend, Paralytic, who had also been\nmoved from the Rent Collectors\noffice and was now working 3 floors\nabove Dong. Paralytic was out,\nhowever, because he had gone to\nwatch a meeting of the all-powerful\ncitizen's committee. Paralytic had\nonce been an important citizen, but\nsince then he had been working for\nthe Baron. As usual, as at all meetings\nof the citizens' committee, the\nChairman, Bigbum was trying to stop\nWhy gate from talking. Why gate\nalways tried to say something at least\nonce every two minutes so that\nnobody would forget he was there.\nWhygate thought that this was a good\nway to become head citizen, but in\nfact all the representatives just wanted\nhim to be quiet.\n\"I don't know if this is the right\nplace to say this,\" Whygate was\nsaying, \"but if it isn't it won't matter\nas I haven't got anything to say.\"\n\"I think we're going round in\ncircles\" said Bigbum, trying to keep\nthe meeting under control and groping\nMummylonglegs' knee at the same\ntime.\n\"What we have to do,\" went on\nWhygate, \"is to make sure that we\nagree with my ideas, whenever I think\nof any.\"\n\"I think we're going round in\ncircles\" said Bigbum.\n\"What about the burger factory,\"\nsaid Ms Plague.\n\"I think that what we have to\nremember is that Arthur Michael buys\nhis clothes from Mark's and Spencer,\"\nsaid Whygate, always ready to see the\nother side's point of view.\n\"I think we're going round in\ncircles,\" said Bigbum.\n\"I want to go out to dinner with\nAnne Diamond,\" said Minty.\n\"Shut up,\" said Bigbum.\n\"No taxation without representation,\" said Whygate, certain that\ntwo minutes had elapsed.\n\"I used to work at Pontin's,\" piped\nup Alan Ego, anxious to put forward\na nice-guy image before the citizens\nhad their elections.\nIn one corner of the room someone\nstarted snoring. It was Custard, who\nhad come to the meeting to get out of\nthe FALLIX office, where he was\nalways ordered to sweep up. Custard\ndecided to keep a low profile for a while, so he escaped from the\nFALLIX office and went to the\ncitizens' committee meeting to let his\nChristmas dinner settle down. The\nconstant prattle from Whygate had\nmade him sleepy, however, and he\nbegan to doze...\nWill Custard wake up?\nWill Whygate stop talking?\nWill Dong beat the space invaders?\nWill Arthur Michael go to C&A? Find out in the next installment of\n\"The Baron of Cheapskate.'\n\" I think what we have to remember is that Arthur\" Michael buys his clothes from Marks and Spencer.\" "
