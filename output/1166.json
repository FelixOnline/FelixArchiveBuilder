    "content": "22 Music Felix * 7 February 2000\n\\fK\nfrequency Rachel Stamp\nHymns for Strange Children\n(Cruisin')\nMention the name Rachel Stamp in a crowded room, and the chances are most people won't know who you're talking about. But there'll be some crazy, mixed-up kid in the corner who\nhas a wicked glint in their eye at the thought of \"the Stamp\". Rachel Stamp is not a girl, but\n3 boys and a girl who play punk rock for the twisted. I 'll never forget the night they played\nat the Union. dBs was transformed from the usual gentle bopping with Abba to a frenzied\nmosh pit, with arms, feet, sweat and tears flying everywhere. The band distorted the air with\ntheir crashing riffs and exploding drums, leaving a trail of glitter and feathers behind them.\nEach band member was wearing a floral dress, and sported the most intensely coloured hair\nyou can imagine. There was something vaguely disturbing about a man wearing green\nbunches and lipstick snarling at you about being tied up. Did I say vaguely? I meant intense-ly! I still have the cork he spat out into the crowd. I'm glad to say that the wine that accompanied it washed out easily.\nBut memories like this don't wash out, and I have to say that I was disappointed that their\nnew album, Hymns for Strange Children didn't have the same intensity. The whole time I was\nlistening, I was thinking how much better it would sound live. On CD, the guitars have been\nquiet e ned down, and the synth has been brought to the front, giving the songs a gentler feel,\nas opposed to the raw glam-punk explosion of their live show.\nDon't underestimate this though. The songs are still fast-moving, heavy-rocking, three minute\nbursts. Subjects range from sex to music, from regret to joy, all with a large slice of angst on\nthe side. Singer David Ryder-Prangley has the perfect voice for the music, ranging from\neffeminate, breathless, tenderness to raw, snarling outrage.\nWhile there are some great tracks here, such as / Wanna be Your Doll and Ladies + Gents\n(with those fantastic lines, \"Everybody knows that girls are stupid / Everybody knows that girls\nare evil / Everybody knows that girls are the devil'), this standard is just not maintained\nthroughout the album. The songs also have little variety to them, all being fast and noisy, racing to get to the end. Tracks such as My Sweet Rose show that they can be subtler if they want\nto, but they have chosen not to. I think this lets the album down, and it can get a bit tedious\nlistening to one angry burst after another.\nOn the whole, I think this should be viewed as a collection of individual songs, rather than\nan album. There is some quality there, but I know that Rachel Stamp can do better.\nTom\nThe Third Eye Foundation\nLittle Lost Soul\n(Domino)\nPigeonholes are lovely things, especially when it\ncomes to music. There's nothing handier when\ntrying to describe a band to someone who's never\nheard them before - \"They're indie-rock/pop-punk/acid jazz etc\". And then along comes The\nThird Eye Foundation (aka. Matt Elliot) with\nanother of his \"drum 'n' bass/hip-hop/noise/classical/ ambient/soundtrack\" albums. At the mo', it's a pretty empty pigeonhole.\nViolins play off wired breakbeat s whilst a swarm\nof locusts attack in the background. A singer from\nthe 40s is mauled by a distorted synth riff from\nhell. Evil sub-bass rallies round a brass band,\nwhilst Roni Size falls over some drums in the\nbackground. So, this is truly original, but also\nbloody weird and inaccessible. It's too edgy for\nbackground music, and too abstract for close\nattention. But still, in Elliot, it is evidence of a maverick and intelligent musician, with a black\nstreak of humour (his last album, called You Guys\nKill Me, featured Jesus on the cover) running\nthrough the album. However, there is nothing\nhere that tops his wicked recent single In Bristol\nWith A Pistol. There, the marriage of swelling\nnoise and sweet tune worked wonders, whereas\nhere it can tend to grate, as another song drifts\npast the eight-minute mark.\nSo it ain't for Steps fans. But there are still some\nfantastic and unpredictable moments. There's no\nreason why someone who listens to, say, Mogwai\nor Tortoise shouldn't dig some o' this ill shit. Pastoral Aphex Twin anyone?\n\u2022 Kunal\nIf anyone would like to join the music team here at Felix then they should drop into the office\nat 12.30pm on Tuesdays and Fridays. On Fridays we sort out the music and on Tuesdays we\nsort out the clubs, which with any luck will be back next week. Nice.\n\n"

    "content": "10 Science Felix \u00bb 7 February 2000\nRage against the Machine\nIs your computer driving you crazy? John Clifford investigates the how and why of PC rage.\nWe all know the feeling, with just half an hour to a vital deadline, the\ncomputer replaces all of your work with the blue screen of death. Or that\ncreeping feeling that you would have been better off using abi ro. The\nfact is, that although computers are the future of communications,\nthey're not that reliable. And when your job requires\nyou to use a computer, many of Britain's workers feel\nat the mercy of their machines.\nOffices are becoming increasingly dependent on\nnetworked PCs, which is extremely useful when the\nentire system works. In the days when typewriters were\nthe norm, the sheer amount of work that needed to be\ndone to produce many copies of the same document\nrequired a huge typing pool.\nEqually, searching through a large database takes\njust a few seconds, compared with a pleasant afternoon in the archive room. But while technology has\nallowed companies to cut down on typists and\narchivists, the remaining staff are expected to do the\njobs of many more people, which has lead to a reduction in job security and an increase in stress levels. So\nwhen a computer fails and stops people from working, the failure can\nlead to over-reaction and a great deal of stress. So how do people deal\nwith a computer failure?\nThe initial reaction is frequently one of disbelief, and asking colleagues for advice. The worst type of crash occurs when a large amount\nof work is lost, and the employee will be fairly desperate to get their data\nback if possible. But IT departments are often equally understaffed and\nover stretched, and several minutes on hold does not help to calm the\nuser down. Which is why a series of recent surveys have shown that a large number of people resort to violence. A quarter of under 25s have\nadmitted to kicking their machines, while 70% have sworn at their com-put ers.75% believe that they are expected to use computers without\nenough support from IT, who frequently treat only the symptoms (without\ndealing with the underlying fault), making it likely to\nhappen again.\nComputer crashes are expensive too. The Confederation of British Industry believe that one lost hour per\nperson per day will cost \u00a325,000 per employee each\nyear. And increased stress levels result in more days off,\nwhich also costs. So what's the solution?\nWhen a computer goes wrong, the user is made to\n|S feel very stupid, particularly if the problem turns out to\nbe a basic error, such as a forgotten password. 80% of\n| employees surveyed believed that they need a lot more\nsupport and training in using certain packages. But\nH HI even then, computers have a habit of going wrong for\nno apparent reason. The onus is on software manufacturers to make systems which are a lot more reliable\nHt\u00bb and user-friendly (see opposite). If a piece of software\nhas a reputation for not crashing at random, it will gradually become a lot more popular. In the meantime, the best way is to take precautions\nagainst crashes - make regular saves, and make sure you have a copy\nof your work on several different computers. Failing that, a number of\nunions are promoting positive forms of stress relief. For example, UNIS ON are running a series of \"get even\" weekends, where attendees are\nencouraged to use a series of highly unreliable old computers, and then\nsmash them with baseball bats when they fail. Not recommended for the\nFelix office.\nGlendower Prep School, 87 Queen's Gate, SW7\nTelephone: 020 7370 1927\nFax: 020 7244 8308\nIT Manager / Troubleshooter required as soon as\npossible for the equivalent of one day per week.\nFlexibility of hours / days etc negotiable. Hourly\nrate of payment. For further details, please\ncontact the school office.\n\n"

This is more than\ndouble the national average, and\nover \u00a3 1 0 0 0 0 0 more than the\nsecond-placed vice-chancellor, Sir\nStuart Sutherland of Edinburgh\nUniversity, according to a league\ntable published in last week's Times Higher Education Supplement.\nVice-chancellors pay rises last\nyear averaged 4.9%, considerably\nhigher than the 3.5% awarded to\nacademic staff. Lecturers unions\ncriticised the increases in the light\nof last year's academic staff\nprotests over pay. Many vice-chancellors, including Professor\nQuelch, received larger pay rises.\nThe London Business School\nemploys two other members of\nacademic staff who are paid more\nthan \u00a3200 000 per year, but Professor Quelch justified their pay as\nbeing \"In line with the School's ranking as the best business\nschool in Europe\", according to\nthe Financial Times. Fees for the\nMaster of Business Administration\n(MBA) course at the School are\n\u00a315 5 4 0 per year for a two year\ncourse.

If your Monday morning lectures\nare unusually cold, it could be due\nto the College's heating system\nbeing turned off last week. The\nsteam supply was turned off last\nFriday, and should have been back\non (courtesy of the new Combined\nHeating and Power Plant) on Sunday night.\nPORTAL OO RETURNS\nA surprise reshuffle in the shadow\ncabinet saw ex-treasury minister\nMichael Portillo move into the\nposition of Shadow Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer. Mr Portillo, newly\nelected MP for Kensington and\nChelsea (following the death of\nAlan Clark) returns to the front\nbench to directly challenge Gordon Brown; this follows his embarrassing defeat in the 1 997 general\nelections at the hands of Labour\nMP Stephen Twigg.\nMr Portillo, 4 6 , replaces Francis Maude, who has moved into\nthe role of Shadow Foreign Secretary. Mr Maude was openly criticised for what was perceived as his\ninability to challenge Gordon\nBrown on key issues. With the\neconomy in good shape and no\nsign of the slump and recession\npredicted following the collapse of\nmarkets across South-East Asia,\nthe general feeling is that the\nfamously right-wing Eurosceptic Mr\nPortillo will have a job on his\nhands. Talking to the BBC, he said\nhe would battle for a \"lower burden of tax\" and \"less interference\nin business\" and proceeded to\nimmediately launch a scathing\nattack on the Labour Party's support for the \"spectacularly badly\nperforming\" Euro, warning of the\n\"economic difficulties\" inherent in\nmaintaining one exchange rate for\nthe whole of Europe.\nSMOKING LINKED TO COT DEATH\nNew research has indicated that\nbabies who are exposed to cigarette smoke have a massively\nincreased risk of Sudden Infant\nDeath Syndrome (SIDS, or cot\ndeath).

    "content": "20 Music Felix \u00bb 7 February 2000\n\\JS\nfrequency And once again it's time for\nmusic. Weil, I hope you've\nnot been neglecting your\nears recently, and if you've\ntaken the chance to visit a few live concerts in the last\nfew weeks, I'm sure you've\nbeen having an excellent\ntime. For some reason, the\nearly months of the year are\noften the best time for con-cert s, and if you're prepared to dip your hand in\nyour pocket you could treat\nyourself to a quite a delicious offering sometime\nsoon.\n... frequency...\nget, get down And my last words for this\nweek must go to the terrible\nnew William Orbit album\nand the satanic majesty of\nhis production on the new\nMadonna record. Not only\ndoes his new album sound\nlike it's been written on a school Casio keyboard, but\nhis new Madonna collaboration is a hideous cover of\nthe Don McClane classic\nAmerican P/e! As well as\nbeing highly unnecessary,\nMr Orbit's production adds\nsome tones that make the\ntune as painful as anything\nI 've heard in years. Please,\nif you've any decency do\nnot buy these records, and\nif you're one of the unlucky\npeople who bought Orbit's album on the back of his\nexcellent Adagio single,\nthen do yourself a favour\nand take it back. Nice.\nThe Artful Dodger\nRewind - The Sound of UK Garage\n(Ministry)\nO K,I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert on garage - I mean, a lot of it's quality, but I wanted to see if what was beneath the surface was good too. And\nI can now happily say that it is. Oh yes. Garage works, and this latest double\nalbum offering mixed by the Artful Dodger really does come straight from the\nheart (ooh, that's poor - sorry) and widens up garage awareness by including\nsome of the best bits since UK garage really took off around '94.\nStriking the match with his own Re-rewind The Crowd Say Bo Selecta, the Artful Dodger spins the tunes ably, running smoothly throughout with a quality mix\nfull of variety and flair playing from the MJ Cole mix of Another Level's Guess\n/ Was A Fool to the pure, unadulterated guest appearance from James Brown\nFunk On Ah Roll (Bump 'n' Flex remix). To my mind anyway, any album that\nfeatures Mr Cool himself has to rock. And then there's the fact that it is, after\nall, Ministry's own label, and (to be fair) have they ever produced anything\nbad? Huh? Of course not. Fluent, infallible sound is manufactured at the\nMOS, and this is really no exception.\nThe two and a half hour session contains some excellent beats and quality\ntunes, and from the moment the deft undertones of DJ Luck and MC Neat's A Little Bit Of Luck shine through the end of Rewind (What DOES Bo Selecta\nmean?) you know it's going to play well, and it does. Through Basement Jaxx's Jump 'n' Shout and Doolally's Straight From The Heart, the first disc also\nincludes US Alliance, Sunship and Robbie Craig, and the Artful Dodger himself presents another two tunes, RU Ready, and Something. His fourth on the\nalbum, Movin' Too Fast, features Romina Johnson, and for me is one of the\nbest tunes on the entire album - which I guess would make it one of the best\nsounds of UK garage. One thing that puzzles me, however, is that the 1 996\ntune which really broke UK garage overground, Double 99's RIP Groove isn't included anywhere. However, tribute is paid to the fathers Karl 'Tuff Enuff'\nBrown and Matt 'Jam' Lamont with their own Needs Good Love.\nThe second disc contains, among others, Tina Moore's Never Gonna Let You\nGo, MJ Cole, Danny J Lewis, and one of the absolute best tunes from last year,\nPaul Johnson's Get Get Down (as danced to drunkenly on a podium in Spain's Pacha last summer by me - d ohl). Truthfully, the Southampton based Artful\nDodger has worked this well and it really does give a good account of the\nquality of the UK garage scene. If you're a Gass club regular, or listen to Ice\nor Mac FM (88.4 and 92.7) then you shouldn't be without this, and if not, then\ndefinitely think about it. You know it's a good sound. But what does Bo Selecta MEAN....?\nWill Oldham\nGuarapero\n(Domino)\nI 've been trying to visualise, whilst listening to\nGuarapero, what Will Oldham should look\nlike. He should be quite small, scraggly yet\nhuge of hair, wearing a big, woolly, rainbow\njumper, yet (in some strange, folk y way) be\nvisually stunning. This isn't really going anywhere as I have no idea what Will Oldham\nlooks like, but think of a Bob Dylan type character as you listen. Somewhat ugly to the ear\non the first hearing, slowly turning into a strange, mutated piece of beauty on second or\nthird. You know what I'm talking about.\nThese songs are a very confusing forty minutes\nor so. The tunes are gorgeously emotional,\ndeep feeling in every note, but with hysterically\nfunny lyrics at the same time. Titles like Big\nBa//s( yes, in THAT sense), do kind of give the\ngame away. I 've got big balls and she's got\nbig balls\" is the basic lyric, with the odd\nrhyming of 'testicles' to change the pace just a little.\nFrom the very first second the marvel of Drinking Woman, with its \"A woman who drinks /\nShe rests her head and thinks / of drinks / She\nthinks of drinks / and sleep / Though it's hours\nbefore she sinks / her head and winks\" lyrics,\nrings out.\nDomino records specialise in the best of the\nslightly obscure, with acts such as Pavement,\nSmog, The Pastels and Ganger (to name but a few) - and Will Oldham rightly earns his place\namong them. The production in some parts is\nvery basic, and the live sections are often hard\nto follow, but if you're a fan of Bob Dylan's style\nand want a slightly more contemporary edge\nto it, Will Oldham is most definitely your man.\nAn outstanding take on 21st century blues.\nPete in Louise\n\n"

For a moment the chat room was\nsilent, until suddenly a message seethed across\nthe page. It read \"Happy New Year.\"\nThis is possibly the most common stereotype of the Linux enthusiast. Even the word\n\"enthusiast\" casts up images of bearded, mid-dle-aged men with personal hygiene issues,\nstrangely keen to discuss their sole interest with\na number of pimple d, solitary youths. But\nmaybe the image of the enthusiast is about to\nundergo its biggest change since the invention\nof the Thermos flask, as it is these people who\npose the biggest threat to the global capitalist\nconspiracy.\n\"Linux\" refers to a group of PC operating\nsystems including Suse (which resembles DOS to the uninitiated), to Red Hat (which looks like\na funkier version of Windows 98). But there, I'm assured, the resemblance ends. So I went to Tottenham\nCourt Road (or TCR to\nits inhabitants) to find\nout what makes\nLinux, and its users,\nso different.\nHaving a desire to type\nwhich is matched only by a similar lack of cash,\nI have made a few contacts in the computer\nworld. Upon entering the computer fair, how ev er, I was still seized by a natural defensive\ninstinct to yell \"You're all virgins!\" and run out\ninto the sunlight. But my room mate's jumper\nand National Health glasses, together with\nabout four days facial hair, put me more at my\nease, and I headed towards the Linux area.\nUnfortunately, having to confess that I had\nnever heard of a \"scuzzy\" rather blew my cover.\nHowever, from my conversations with the\ns cu zz ies, I learnt the following about Linux:\nUnlike the secretive, shady work of such sinister capitalists as Microsoft, Linux is freely created and distributed by an International Brotherhood of programmers. This was made possible by a program written by a man called Linus\nTorvatis, called the Kemal, which calls on other\nsmall programs, called modules, to perform all\nthe individual tasks necessary in order to run a computer. Unlike Microsoft's Windows, all of\nthe code behind these modules is freely avail-able, and Linux's International Brigade will\nrewrite these modules (and continually invent\nmore) in order to make their machines work\nbetter, and will usually then make their work\navailable.\nThis system of development has a number\nof effects. Firstly, unlike commercial programmers (who have \"disillusioned idealist\" written\nall over them), Linux's programmers are motivated only by a desire to make their system work\nin the best, most efficient way. As a result of this,\nLinux is streamlined, making it use less of your\nsystem than the shaky electronic giants. It also\nleads to the well known (and worrying) viewpoint that Linux \"feels more stable\", which\ncould be a godsend to the user who is used to\nseeing an article follow the 2nd law of thermo-dynamics.\nSecondly, it is a well known fact that you\ncan give a set of computer enthusiasts two random three letter acronyms (or TLAs) and they\nwill debate for hours the relative merits of the\ntwo systems you have just inadvertently\ndescribed. The same holds with Linux -as users\ndebate the merits of one module or another,\nLinux evolves into a number of different species,\nwith many versions of each. Suse is preferred for\nmany servers, while graphical interfaces such as\nRed Hat are the choice of the general user,\nallowing a standard wallpaper of a desired\nfemale or component.\nIn theory, it seems,\nMicrosoft should\nhave nothing to\nworry about. Havf ing cornered the\nmarket in opera t IX^ UV US. in9 systems,\nbrowsers and common software, and having ruthlessly purged its rivals, it could afford to\nstart annexing small countries by now. But Linux\nis not really a commercial venture, and so can-not, by definition, be driven out of business. Its\nmain market currently lies in system administrators such as in the Department of Computing,\nwhere Linux machines have pride of place,\nwhile NT machines are hidden away in a less\ndesirable room (one with windows). Servers,\nboth local and internet, it seems, prefer Linux,\nas a network is much less likely to crash of its\nown accord. X% of servers are believed to run\nLinux. It also has the advantage that the administrator can (fairly) easily tailor the system to his\nor her exact needs.\nAn even bigger threat, it is predicted, will\ncome as more software is developed to run on\ngraphical Linux systems, providing reliability\nand ease of use (and hopefully eliminating the\nneed for your computer to become an antique\ncuriosity within nine months) for the ordinary\nuser without a degree in computing and with\nother interests. It has the potential, with some\nman oe uv ring, to weaken Windows share of the\nmarket.\nAs the last of the computer fair visitors hurry\nhome to catch Star Trek, I head back to a welcome shave and a date.

It's surprising that so many\nsupposedly fine minds throughout\nthe history of civilisation have spent\nso long debating the existence of\nGod, the problem of evil and the\nnature of free will, when all it takes to\nsort the whole thing out is one science undergrad with a page to fill\nbefore Star Trek.\nObviously anyone with a faith in\nthis day and age is scientifically illiterate. Imperial should reconsider its\nadmissions policy - at present we\nmust be awarding degrees to several hundred of these half wits a year!\nI look forward to reading a the-o logi st's opinion of the chemical\ncomposition of interstellar dust\nclouds in next week's issue.\nYours,\nA Christian\nSUMMER BALL UPDATE\nDear Dave,\nJust a quick note to let you (and\neverybody else!) know that this year's Imperial College Summer Ball will\ntake place on SATURDAY 1 7th JUNE\n2000, at the Alexandra Palace (don't worry, it's not the hall we used last\nyear!); it's going to cost you \u00a350,\nand it's going to be a night never to\nbe forgotten. Guest speaker is going\nto be Trevor Phillips (ICU President\n19781), who by that point may well\nbe Deputy Mayor of London. There\nare only limited numbers of tickets\navailable, so come on folks! To show\nyour interest, please e mail sum-mer.ball@ic.ac.uk and book your\nplace for the event of the Millennium\n(oh bugger, referred to the millen ni um, sorry!)\nCheers,\nThe Summer Ball Team\nBLATANT PLUG\nDear Sir,\nAt the end of Autumn term,\nmembers of the Conservative and\nLabour societies met for the purposes of an organised debate, we felt\nthat the College was missing out in\nthe absence of a debating society\nand resolved to go some way\ntowards doing something about it.\nDespite the effective absence of any\nadvertising, the event, a debate on\nthe privatisation of the London\nUnderground, was considered sufficiently successful to warrant repeat-ing. Our next meeting will cover the\npredictable yet pressing issue of\nBritain's possible entry into the European single currency. This will take\nplace in the union Dining Hall at\n1:00 on Thursday, February 10. The\ndebate is free to enter, and there will\nbe no obligation to join either of the\nsocieties.\nPlease contact us\n(alun.hart@ic.ac.uk or patrick.hayes\n@ic.ac.uk) if you wish to speak, suggest a topic for future debate or wish\nto put your name on a debating\nmailing list. We look forward to seeing you.\nYours faithfully\nAlun Hart (Conservative Soc)\nPaddy Hayes (Labour Soc)\nPICKING A WINNER I'm fully prepared to accept that\nUnion elections aren't the most\nexciting thing on the planet. Being\naccosted by random strangers on\nthe Walkway, finding every surface\ncovered by a wall of inane posters\n(when you're already five minutes\nlate for a lecture), or being forced\nto wade; through a mountain of\nelection gump f every time you turn\naround, is hardly my idea of fun.\nHell, I was a willing participant in\nthe whole process this time Inst\nyear, and it bored the hell out of\nme.... Sadly, however, this intensely\nboring spectacle is actually a really\nimportant part of the year. The five\ngrinning idiots that we finally get\naround to electing will represent\nour views and interests to our\ndepartments, our wardens, our financiers and our government. They\nwill be in regular contact with the\npeople who control our daily lives\nand, once in a while, they will actually have the chance to affect the\ndecisions that the College makes.\nSo, much as you may not want\nto, I'm afraid you're going to have\nto take an interest in the forthcoming elections. By the time this edition reaches your hands, a dozen\nor so gallant / foolhardy / manipulative / stupid individuals will have\nput their names forward, and will\nhave begun their campaigns (I suspect that the wall-to-wall posters\nwill probably have given this away).\nHowever, with at least five or six\noptions to chose from for some of\nthe posts (ie President), how do you\npick your preferred option? Well,\nfirstly there are the candidates\nmanifestoes, which will (hopefully)\nappear in Felix this time next week.\nSome may suggest a solid background of responsibility and Union\nposts. Although these are useful (it\ncertainly helps to know about the\nway the Union and the College are\nrun before you start the job) they're\ncertainly not the be all and end all\nwhen it comes to selecting the best\nperson for the job. Similarly, whilst\na solid set of polices and goals is\nadmirable, there's a fine line-between pointless idealism and\nmonotonous pessimism, for exam-ple, I expect.that all the candidates\nfor the top job will speak of trying\nto improve communication (what-ever that really means), and make\nthe Union more accessible but\nwhilst that sounds very nice, it's hardly a concrete objective for the\nyear. Try to see through the management double-speak and inane\nwaffle, and work out if they intend\nto do anything during the year (or\nwhether they're just after some CV points). Which, of course, never\nhappens. Oh no.\nThe second means of contact\nis through hustings. By asking the\ncandidates the questions you want\nan answer to, you can not only find\nout their views on all the key topics\n(and all the silly ones too), but it's also your only chance to find out\nwhat the candidates are like under\npressure. Do they go to pieces, or\ndo they stroll through tough questioning and hostile audiences (hus-tings at St Mary's are traditionally a great test of this';? After all, it's incredibly important that your\nprospective sabbaticals have the\nability to stand up for themselves\nand stick to their guns (whilst\nremaining calm and presentable)\nwhen faced with hostility - they'll\nface that on a weekly basis at College meetings.\nFinally, there are the more\nethereal aspects. All those posters\nmight not tell you very much about\npolicies or ideals, but they'll probably give you an insight into the\ncandidates sense of humour and\npersonality (and if they're promising to improve communication,\nthis'll probably give you a pointer\nto their chances of success). The\nmost decisive factor, however, is\nprobably word of mouth. Ultimately, you're looking for a group of\ndecent people who can get along\nwith each other, so reputation and\nimage is everything. Somewhere\nalong the line, someone you know\nprobably knows each and every\none of the candidates a little, so try\nand get their opinions - don't automatically vote like sheep, but don't discount the possibility that some of\nthe candidates are, in fact, complete idiots. It has been known to\nhappen.\n\u2022 Dave All complaints should be addressed to the Editor. If no satisfactory\nreply is received, contact ICU Exec via the Union President\n\n"

    "content": "7 February 2000 \u2022 Felix Columns 15\nPoint Back in the dim dark days, when\nthe College languished somewhere\nnear the bottom third of the academic premiership, Sir Ron\nOxburgh stepped onto the great\nvessel IC and took the helm. By\nattracting big funding and killing\noff paper-shufflers, Ron has transformed the College, and we are\nnow number two. With some more\nrefining of the yards of red tape\nemanating from the Sherfield\nbuilding, he could probably push\nus close to Cambridge.\nSoon, however, Ron will be\ngone - and the Council has recognised that even bigger f under s are\nnow required to leapfrog our\nfriends in the Fens. They needed a Fund-u like \u2122 to finish the job off.\nIn selecting this new leader to take\nEurope's MIT into this bright new\nmillennium, the College Council\napproached one Sir Richard Sykes,\na bluff Yorkshire businessman who\nhas just executed the world's biggest pharmaceutical merger,\nand has access to the highest ech-el on s, the biggest names, and the\ndeepest pots. He dutifully thought it\nover, and agreed, providing he can\ncontinue playing with his new toy\nuntil 2002 - when he will throw it\nout of the playpen and be given a shiny new academic institution to\nkeep him happy in his retirement.\nBut is that truly in the best interests of the College? No. Ron had\nmany things going for him when he\narrived in 1 994 - a senior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence,\nbefore which he was a senior academic at Queen's College, Cambridge. He cannot be accused of\nhaving no knowledge of student\nlife and students interests, whereas\nthe last time Sir Richard was near a university campus, it was at Bristol,\nhe was studying for a PhD in\nmicrobial biochemistry, and Petula\nClark was top of the charts with\nDowntown. Is it right for an institution such as IC to be headed up by\nsomebody who has spent so long\naway from the demands of a cade mia? Can we expect him to understand the needs and demands of\nstudents when contemplating top-up fees, for example? And although Imperial has only recently been through a huge merger of\nits own, will he pursue his obviously instinctive tendency to enlarge\nand central is e( with, for example\nthe Institute of Cancer Research)\nand yet again put the interests of\nstudents - or will that be 'consumer\nunits' - further down the agenda?\nDon't get me wrong. The\nappointment of a new Rector will\nbe good for Imperial, as the current incumbent is obviously getting\na little stale, and is enjoying his\nnew seat in the House of Lords. A fresh start is essential, and could\nharmon is e the College. Yet we see\nfrom the front page of this fine\njournal that one-fifth of the academic staff of the College were\nsidelined by the promise that \"it\nwouldn't be a medic\". How ridiculous. For Breakpoint's money, one\nman (a medic) has shown himself\nto be a leader of public opinion, a serious academic, holding the\ncommon-touch, and yet being able\nto walk with kings. That man is, of\ncourse, Lord Winston, IC's professor of fertility studies. Why do we\nalways assume that the grass is\ngreener on the other side of the\nfence?\nCOW CONCERNS\nWhen a group of students from ICU went on a trip out to Imperial College at Wye, they were\naware that they were going to a college with\nquite a different focus to the rest of IC. However, these students were still amazed when they\nwalked past a lecture theatre at Wye and saw a large picture of a cow on the overhead pro j ec tor. The lecturer was pointing at the picture,\napparently explaining what the different bits of\nthe animal did.\nONION SELLERS\nRecently Kevin was in a kitchen shared by a group of IC Students. Kevin noticed that most of\nthe cupboards (as well as many of the surfaces)\nwere piled high with onions. The student who\nowns the onions, let's call him Stuart, claimed\nto have acquired them accidentally. Stuart had\ntried shopping over the internet, but failed to\nrealise that the quantity field required him to\nenter the number of kilograms (not the number\nof onions) that he required. Stuart is now looking for ideas about what he can do with a kitchen full of onions. Kevin would like to warn\nStuart, and anyone else who may be storing\nlarge quantities of onions that they can be dan-gero us.An amusing incident occurred when\nmany Pentagon staff began to feel nauseous as\na strange smell pervaded their offices. Their\nbuilding was evacuated as an attack by terrorists using biological weapons was feared. The\narmy and firefighters who were called to the\nscene eventually found the source of the fumes\nto be a storeroom containing rotting onions.\nThe room had recently been opened by a chef,\nwho was immediately overcome, and collapsed.\nCURIOUS CROSSINGS\nIt has recently been brought to Kevin's attention\nthat many of the local Pelican crossings possess\nMishMash A Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\ntheir own individual character. Kevin has recently been crossing many roads in the South Kensington area investigating. Kevin has concluded\nthat it would be impossible to find such a collection of quirky crossings anywhere else in the\nworld. For example, take the crossing in front of\nthe Albert Hall. Here, as soon as you press the\nbutton, the lights immediately begin to change -the responsiveness is quite amazing. This particular crossing also produces a rhythmic bleeping\nsound, which Kevin has determined is due to it\npossessing two beepers which do not beep in\ntime. In contrast the Exhibition Road crossing\n(adjacent to the north side of Princes Gardens)\ndoes not possess any audible signal. The most\nfamous local crossing is the one situated at the\nmiddle of High Street Ken. Here the sound produced to indicate that it is safe to cross is unusually fast. A number of sources have suggested\nthat its distinctive sound has been sampled to\nprovide a sound effect for shoot-em-up arcade\ngames.\nCORROSIVE NUTS\nSalt and vinegar peanuts are now available in\nthe union bars. Kevin had never come across\nthese before and was not particularly impressed\nwhen he tried them for the first time. They tasted fruity; more salt and apple than salt and\nvinegar. An explanation for this was found on\nthe label, which revealed that citric acid had\nbeen used as the flavouring. Although Kevin is\naware that it is impractical to use vinegar to\nflavour items such as crisps and nuts, he would\nlike to know why hydrofluoric acid - which being\nan extremely strong acid can provide a strong\nflavour in small amounts, and is normally in salt\nand vinegar flavourings - was not used.\nTo comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\nor email kevin@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "7 February 2000 \u2022 Felix Business 9\nIndustrial Strength Internet ting Bashar i Bakar i This new, new thing (as Michael Lewis calls the\ninternet) really is a boon to technically minded pe o ple. Now, I don't want to turn off half my audience\nwho are not computer scientists or electrical engi-ne ers. The whole point is that as we turn from pure\ntechnology to business, IC undergrads are better\nqualified than the vast majority of current e practitioners. Most of the articles that are written on e commerce focus on heart warming stories of a person overcoming the odds and becoming paper rich\non the Initial Public Offering (IPO). I don't see any\nreason why e businesses should not be subjected to\nthe same kind of rational analysis that any other\nkind of business would be subjected to. I will not\nclaim that my knowledge is in any way comprehensive but at least it will be more useful than some of\nthe mind candy that is passing as analysis.\nHave you noticed how many of the new e commerce sites are not doing anything fundamentally new, but just doing an online version of an\noffline business? There is nothing inherently wrong\nwith that - the driving force behind business is not\noriginality but the bottom line. With that being the\ncase, it is useful to compare the offline and online\nsectors of similar businesses. As most e commerce\nsites are just retailers, it is useful to compare them\nto their offline brethren.\nIn 1998, an estimated \u00a3194bn was spent in\nthe high street, while nearly \u00a32bn was spent on e commerce. So it is with this background that you\ncan judge all the adverts for new web sites. As e spending grows from this miniscule 1% of our\nspending, they know that if they hang on to our\nattention for the next couple of years and retain\nmarket share, they will become the Boots, Argos or\nWHSmith of the internet.\nProfit is equal to revenue minus costs. This simple little equation always comes in handy when you\nare required to do a business case study, as seems\nto be de rig u er when applying for a job these days.\nSo why are the vast majority of web based businesses losing money? Surely, the whole point of\nbacking a company is that you expect to receive\nprofits in the form of dividends? This basic business\nrequirement is being forgotten for the meantime, as\ninvestors are willing to suspend their caution in the\nhope that their business will be one of the big boys\nleft when e commerce has reached its saturation\nlevel. (It's also very helpful if the rest of the investing\ncommunity are similarly willing to suspend their\njudgement as well, and allow you to make large\ncapital gains with your shares in loss making ven-ture s) The reason that they are making losses is that,\nas everyone knows, surfers don't go to sites that are\nactually advertised on the web. You need heavy\noffline advertising to reach that critical mass that is\nso crucial to the success of any web business. For\ninstance, I 've never been to the last minute. com web\nsite, and I don't have any intention to for a long time\nyet. But inevitably, I have seen their advertising on\nthe side of the buses running up and down Kensington High Street.\nThe other side of this particular aspect is that\nbarriers to entry for web based businesses are\nfamously low. You can run a state of the art web site\ncirca 1993 (ie. static web pages) for about as much\neffort as writing this article. The next step up is to\nusefully process the information that surfers give, so\nthat they can actually order that widget. This\ninvolves shoving a database on the back end of\nyour web site, by either a) finding an ISP that can\nhandle this or b) shelling out on a leased line to\nhouse your own computer. Then you have to think\nabout the questions that are bread and butter to\ncomputer scientists, such as what is your data\nmodel, what legal transactions are valid, and what\nkind of web forms you'll use for transactions. Now,\nthis is more than a case of just fancy graphics. You\nare now facing the questions that PC manufacturers faced when they developed the first Graphical\nUser Interfaces for PCs. These are issues that the\nlarger US web companies confronted a few years\nago. For instance, you can trade shares in two\nclicks in e 'trade once you've registered. Having\nsaid that, the key to web development is speed. The\nspecifications of web browsers are being updated\ncontinuously, so it is more important to have magnet content that will bring users back time and\nagain, rather than employing the latest gimmickry.\nWhich brings out another aspect of web based\nbusinesses. In essence, web sites are publishing\nbusiness. Granted they have features unlike any\nprevious publishing enterprises, but nevertheless\npublishing businesses they are. The one thing that\nkills a site more quickly than anything else is stale\ninformation. Thafs why the e tail ers are suited to the\nweb, because once you have the data model\nimplemented, you can leave it up to the database\nand your surfers to provide up to date information.\nIfs what has been called the stick and cauldron\nphenomenon. You provide the stick and the cauldron for preparing a meal and you leave it up to\nyour guests to bring the vegetables and the meat\nfor the feast, thereby saving you most of the work.\nThis publishing aspect also acts as a barrier\nand a different i at or between the online sites and\nthere offline cousins. You can build a community\nfeel around your site, and have much more information about your users than even supermarkets\ncan dream of. So, even when your offline competitors move online, as they inevitably will, users are\nused to your site.\nIt is interesting to note that the company that\nkicked off the whole internet shebang in its current\nform, Netscape, was swallowed whole by AOL.\nWhich begs the question: what is more important\nfor internet success - knowledge of the technology,\nor knowledge of the customer?. Steve Case got his\nbusiness training as a marketing manager with\nProctor & Gamble (as did Stephen Ballmer, the\nMicrosoft CEO, incidentally). This is quite interest-ing, as P&G has over a century of experience of\nmarketing to Joe Public, and spends more in doing\nso (about $200m around the globe) than any other\ncompany on earth. This marketing know how crops\nup again and again in some of the biggest internet\ncompanies. The heads of ebay and e toys are both\nex-Disney acolytes, for instance.\nFinally, take the case of last orders.com. This\nbusiness was launched last October and just sells\nbooze, delivering to you if you are within the M25.\nBefore a bottle was even drunk, the company was\nvalued at ElOOm pounds. Firstly, I would suggest\nthat you mistrust journalists valuations of e businesses, because if you carefully watch the headline\nfigure that is quoted and the quoted figures a few\nmonths later it is invariably different. What is essentially taking the place of the corner shop is valued\nat such a ludicrous amount because the financiers\nwere backing the management team as much as\nthe idea.\nWatch this space as I hope to get a scoop on\na pre-lPO straight technology company and one of\nthe biggest European internet companies.

    "content": "6 Feature Felix \u2022 7 February 2000\nIS THE PORTRAYAL OF VIOLENCE ON THE As I watched the Tyson v Francis fight last week-end, the thought suddenly came over me: Why\nam I doing this - as far as I'm concerned, I don't even like boxing... Yet I was sitting in front\nof the TV, watching two grown men (of whom at\nleast one ought to know better) bludgeoning\nthe hell out of one another, all in the name of\nsport. Surely that's not right? With our late\ntwentieth century idealism solidly entrenched in\neach and every one of us, we've all been\nbrought up to believe that fighting is wrong and\nisn't something that any of us should enjoy -and yet the chance to watch two people beat\neach other up is a multi-million pound event,\nwatched by 21 0 0 0 people in the arena and\ntens of thousands more on pay-per-view. So\nhave we really evolved beyond the need to\nrevel in violence, or are we just repressing our\ntrue desires?\nmedia intrusion The first point to realise is that, whilst it was\nboxing that first put the idea into my head, this\never-increasing level of violence is something\nthat's all around us, enjoyed by the masses, not\njust a warped minority. As we keep being told\nby the conservative press and major religious\ngroups, violence in film and television is steadily increasing - not necessarily a bad thing (the\ninterpretation which they always attempt to\nthrow onto their findings) but a fact of life\nnonetheless. In the fifties, BBC regulations stated that a man and woman were not permitted\nto be in bed together unless at least one of the\ncharacters had both their feet on the floor. In\nthe seventies, US network television was so\ninsanely cautious that regulators insisted that\nHappy Days star Henry Winkler could only wear\na leather jacket when sitting on a motorbike (as\na result of which, the show's writers simply\nadded the bike into every shot, whether indoors\nor out). Today, although US television is still\ntightly controlled by cautious advertising executives, British TV is extremely relaxed, with all\nmanner of sex, violence and swearing permitted after the nine o 'clock watershed (and, with\nincreasing frequency, beforehand).\nA similar pattern emerges if we look toward\nthe movies. In the post-war years, filmmakers\nhad the ability to convey a sense of cruelty and\nviolent behaviour without actually having the\nneed to show it on screen, yet today it seems\nimpossible to suggest any semblance of violence without a detailed set of close-ups. Part\nof the reason for this is the increase in budget\nand effects technology - in the forties and\nfifties, it wasn't actually possible to recreate a massive car-crash or decapitation by a giant\ninsect, yet today it can be done at the drop of\na hat (albeit a hat containing about ten million\ndollars). Nonetheless, there has to be a reason\nwhy our moral standards have now altered to\nsuch an extent that, whilst sex, violence and\nbad language was once disallowed, the British\nBoard of Film Classification guidelines now\nstate that a movie shall be suitable for aPG classification where \" bad language may be\nused occasionally\"; \"there may be occasional\nnudity\"; \"there may be some mild sexual in nu endo\"; and \"exciting horror scenes may be\nallowed\".\nPart of the issue is a major divide of opinions along national lines. In much of the rest of\nEurope, issues of sex and bad language are of\nvery minor concern, whilst violence is considered far more carefully. On the other hand, the\nentire issue of censorship is treated much more\ncautiously in the US, where religious groups\n(particularly the Catholic Church and the\nNational Christian Coalition) have enormous\nsway over both Hollywood and the four major\nTV networks. Consequently, you'll be hard\npressed to find much evidence of violence or\nbad language on main stream US television\n(the occasional episode of NYPD Blue aside).\nIndeed, so oppressive is the \"moral majority\"\nregime that an NC-1 7 rating (the equivalent of\nan 18 in the UK) is deemed to be the kiss of\ndeath on any movie - mul it plex cinemas won't show them, network TV won't screen their trail-ers, and major newspapers won't advertise\nthem. As a result, the major studios will jump\ntall buildings in a single bound in order to\nensure that their movies make the grade and\nfall into the 'R' category (which means that anyone can watch, provided they're accompanied\nby someone over eighteen). Hence, the net\nresult of all those attempts to san it is e US media\nhas in fact been to open up movies like Saving\nPrivate Ryan, Boogie Nights and Starship\nTroopers to a family audience. Hmmm...\nBut, as I 've suddenly realised, we've drifted\nfrom the point here - we've moved into the\nsame realm as the censors, where extreme violence is treated hand-in-hand with sex, nudity\nand bad language. Which is surely wrong. The\nincreased sexual content of modern movies is\nnothing to worry about or bemoan - it's simply\na sign of increasingly liberal attitudes amongst\nthe populace. Similarly, the reason you'll find\nso much heavy swearing in your average mainstream movie is the simple fact that life's like\nthat - if your star says \"oh darn\" when he finds\nhis girlfriend shagging his best mate, you're not\nreally going to describe that as decent character is ation, now are you?\nOf course, sex sells too - put a suggestive\npicture of Sarah Michelle Gellar on the poster\nfor your latest teen-flick and you've got a hit on\nyour hands. Include a couple of shots which\nimply that she gets her kit off in the trailer, and\nyou'll start breaking box office records. However, this is only the modern manifestation of\nsomething that's been going on since the dawn\nof Hollywood. Suggestive shots of Marilyn\nMonroe, Lauren Bacall and Rita Hayworth all\nhelped to sell their fair share of cinema tickets\nin their day - the only difference was that the\nstandards of the day placed limitations on how\nfar the star could go. In the fifties, if your star\nhad wound up in a threesome half-way through\nthe movie, it would have said something very\nquestionable about her sense of morality. Now\nit can only help to increase her status and desirability (as anyone who's seen Denise Richards\nin Wild Things will undoubtedly attest). So, is\nthis a sign of ever-falling standards, or the\nacceptance of a more relaxed attitude to life?\n\n"

We not only\nhave five pairs of tickets to give away for Leonardo Di Caprio's new film\nThe Beach, but we also have copies of the book of the same name by Alex\nGarland.\nJust imagine being told that a paradise island is out there and you get\ngiven a map to guide you to it. What would you do? This is basically the\npremise of The Beach. Richard (Di Caprio) is an American backpacker\nwho has been told about such an island and been given such a map. He\npersuades some fellow travellers to join him in his quest to find it, and\neventually they find this paradise which has a small community of travellers. Richard and co decide to join these travellers - but all is not as perfect as it seems.\nEssentially, this has the potential to be an ace film considering who has\nwritten, directed and produced it. Danny Boyle (director), Andrew Macdonald (producer) and John Hodge (screenplay writer) have all worked\ntogether before to bring us some fantastic films, so if this is anything like\nthem, we'll be in for a treat.\nSo, would you like to win some Odeon film tickets or a book? If you\nwould, figure out the answer to this weeks question, which is:\nName all the films that Danny Boyle, Andrew Macdonald and\nJohn Hodge have worked on together since 1994\n[ Hint: There are five to name ]\nTo be in with a chance of winning a prize, e mail your answer to film.felix\n\u00a9ic.ac.uk before 12pm on Wednesday and keep your fingers crossed. If\nyou have a preference for a book or ticket prize then write book or film in\nthe subject heading of the e mail. The winners of last week's contest\n(which offered the chance to win a pair of tickets to see the fantastic American Beauty) were:\nL Shankar\nP Rowlands\nA Tang\nG Taylor\nJ Fisher\nPlease call by the Felix office to collect your prizes. And for those of you\nwho are wondering what the answer to last week's question was, the solution was that Thomas Newman connects American Beauty, The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.\nWhat's On At ICU Cinema\nThis week at our very own cinema, you'll find the Arnie flick End Of Days\nand the high school comedy American Pie. Check the posters on the walkway for times and dates of showings\nEnd Of Days\nNew York City, 1 979: In a Manhattan hospital, a beautiful baby girl enters\nthe world. That same day the Pope is informed of the birth of the child. Her\nbirth has been feared for centuries. The scripture has indeed proven true:\nthe child, Christine, bears the birthmark of the anti-Christ, and has been\nchosen for an unholy union. Following an unorthodox baptism in the hos-pital's morgue, she is returned to her mother. But things are far from nor-mal. The inevitable countdown to doom has begun. New York City,\nDecember 28, 1999: As the world approaches the end of a century and\nthe end of a millennium, it is the beginning of the end. Jericho Cane\n(Arnold Schwarzenegger), a beaten down ex-cop, wakes up to another\nday, oblivious to the struggle that he soon must face. Christine, who has\ngrown into a beautiful young woman, has spent her entire life on medic a tion, trying to numb the pain from the disturbing thoughts which haunt her.\nNow, as the world stands on the brink of the new millennium, it is up to\nCane to protect Christine - and all mankind - from witnessing the end of\ndays. And it is in this, the darkest hour, that all mankind must have faith..\nAmerican Pie\nIn terms of crudity, American Pie simply is on a whole new level. This certainly isn't the kind of movie you'd take your mother to (or your girlfriend\nfor that matter), but nonetheless it has moments of genuine comic brilliance amongst the rapid-fire gags. The premise is simple - a group of four\nteenagers in their final year of High School make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate, and promptly set about a variety of misadventures in a series of misguided attempts to get their end away. An average night in the Union you might think, but these guys are sadder, more\ndesperate and more full of lame chat-up lines than anyone you might have\nmet at IC - they will, quite literally, do anything. I won't give away too many\nof the jokes, for fear of ruining some of the most inspired (or sick, depending on your point of view) moments, but suffice to say you can't understand\nthe meaning of the word \"depraved\" until you've seen a teenager attempt\nto shag an apple pie...\nThe problem, however, is that once you've identified the level that the\nmovie's operating on, the jokes become phenomenally obvious - and frequently you'll find the entire cinema laughing hysterically five minutes\nbefore the punchline arrives. Admittedly the quality of the stars doesn't help\nmatters much (the cast list peaks out with Willow from Buffy), but you're\nnonetheless left with a distinct feeling that you could probably have written something not entirely dissimilar yourself, given about a week off from\nCollege.\n\n"

    "content": "28 Films Felix \u2022 7 February 2000\nDavid Morgan interviews the director of Stigmata\nBorn in 1962 and educated at Oxford University,\nRupert Wainwright is an up and coming director\nwhose most recent work is the new horror movie\nStigmata. Check out this interview and find out\nwhat he's got to say.\nYou actually came across the script some time\nago. How extensive a role have you played in it\nsince?\nIt's one of those stories that people say \"how\nlong did it take to get the movie made\". On one\nhand, six years wandering around throwing it at\npeople and hearing them say \"no\", before I walked into a guy's office and pitched it to him in\none line. I said it's about this girl who doesn't believe in God and she gets the wounds of Jesus.\nA priest comes from the Vatican and tries to help\nher. I sent him the script and he called me to say\nit wasn't as good as the pitch. From the moment\nthe script was bought for MGM, I was very\ninvolved with the writing. It's one of those movies\nwhere there's so much to find out about that I really became obsessed with it... In the original\ndraft of the script, there was nothing about this\nmissing gospel. I started trying to find out how the\nmovie could end. In the original ending, she literally hovered up into heaven surrounded by the\nDalai Lama, CNN and the Pope. I thought, well,\nthis might not work.\nThere was an interesting bit about half way\nthrough where she spoke Aramaic; she just spoke\nthe last words of Jesus on the cross. So, I started\nrummaging around the New Testament trying to\nfind out what else she could say or do. I came\nacross this book called, \"Who wrote the New Testament?\" This is a really fascinating book. Essentially, it examines all the strands in the four\ngospels. I found out about this gospel that's sometimes called the fifth gospel, the gospel of St\nThomas. As we said at the end of the movie this\nwas found in 1945. So, I started working that in.\nThe words \"split a piece of wood and I am there\"\nare straight from that gospel. It's something I got\nobsessed with.\nAre you happy with the way the film has been\ntrailed?\nI am very happy with the theatrical trailer. I thought that did a really good job of indicating the\nrange of different ideas and storylines. I wasn't quite so crazy about some of the TV ads. They\nseemed to be very Blair Witch-y, which the film\nobviously isn't. It's very difficult to sell this film in\nthirty seconds. Basically, they went for sensation\nrather than story.\nHow much do you believe in the story of the missing gospel?\nIn 1945 two Egyptian guys who were on the\nrun from the police were digging for peat to take\nhome. One of them broke the ground with a shovel and found a vase. He figured there would\nbe gold in there so he broke it open. This golden\ndust spread out. It was leather dust, because there\nwere one hundred and thirteen leather books in\nthere. He took them home, but because he was\nwanted by the police he couldn't leave the house,\nso he gave the books to his mother. She couldn't read, so she used them for kindling. After a while\nthey thought they could flog them to a tourist.\nThey found an antiques dealer and they sold them\nto him. He eventually flogged them to a guy was\nrunning a museum in Cairo. They slowly started\ntranslating them. They took a long time to translate as it was just after the war. Gradually, the\nword got out that they were copies of very early\ngospels. A copy of one of them was smuggled out\nof the institute in 1949 and translated in Switzerland. That was the gospel of St. Thomas. This\nwhole treasure trove of early gospels has been\ntranslated. Some of them are a bit mad, but the\ngospel of Thomas has stood out as one of the\nmost apparently authentic. By looking at it, experts\nof New Testament theology indicate it may have\nbeen written as early as 50 AD. That means that it\npredates the four gospels of the New Testament by\none hundred to one hundred and fifty years. It's very highly regarded in the world of New Testament theology as a crucial aspect of trying to\nunderstand what Jesus said.\nThe film is at times fairly critical of the Catholic\nChurch as an institution. Was that something you\nwere keen to address?\nNot initially, no. But the more I discovered\nabout the way the Vatican has hoarded all this\nstuff... Basically, there was this guy wandering\naround Israel two thousand years ago saying a bunch of stuff. About two hundred years after his\ndeath, these gospels started floating about, and\nno one knows which one is more or less relevant.\nWhen the Romans adopted Christianity in 325 AD\nthey tried to organise the church, which up until\nthat time had been a disorganised religion; it was\nsecret and scattered.\nWhat I say about the Catholic Church is that\nit is more Roman than Catholic. They have taken\nall the rough edges off Christianity and tried to put\nit all into one box. They don't want anyone to\nknow what's going on outside the box. It's an\nenormous shame for Christians and agnostics\nalike. It's easy to be anti-Vatican, and I almost\njump on that bandwagon. They have an enormous repository of what they call the secret\narchives, which would be fascinating for Christians and agnostics to know about - but they won't let any of it out, which is a shame.\nCan you describe the style of your film?\nThere are two styles to the film. One is very\nlock down camera, very quiet, just listening to the\nwords. The other is much more impressionistic. I was trying to take you inside the head of someone\nwho thought they were being crucified. I didn't want to do something that was like masterpiece\ntheatre, so you fell asleep and described it later. I wanted to make you understand. I 've done a lot\nof research about what people say that they felt\nwhen crucified. I wanted to try and make you live\nthrough it.\nThere are a lot of references in the film to dn\nfe rent sorts of movies. For example, Altered States\nwas one of the movies I watched a lot. It takes you\ninside the mind of someone who is going mad,\nand you understand cultural references that are\ngoing on inside his brain.\n\n"

    "content": "38 Sport Felix \u00ab 7 February 2000\nWomen lose the match but not their pride\nVolleyball\nBad news has finally arrived, with the\nfirst defeat of the season for the\nwomen's volleyball team. This happened against Kent University, a very\nstrong team with their own professional coaching staff providing the\nteam with all their needs, excellent\nsports facilities on their campus, and\na top quality record in BUSA.\nUnfortunately, since we were\nnow at the BUSA knock-out stages,\nthe 3-1 defeat means the end of the\nseason for us which, by recognition\nof our opponents, is pretty unfair for\nsuch a good team. Nevertheless, this\nwas the best season ever for our\nteam and you can be sure that the\ngirls made IC proud.\nImperial started better, much\nbetter. As their coach admitted at the\nend of the match, they had no idea\nIC's women were this good. So, we\ntook them by surprise and won the\nfirst set by 25-23, thanks to some\nbrilliant serving and top-quality\ngame distribution from our setters,\nMagali and Szun Szun. It was mag-n if i cent! In the second set, things got\nharder, Kent made some readjust-ment s, we missed some easy balls\nand that was enough to make the\ndifference. Kent got it by 25-19. But\nstill, things were pretty close and our\nplayers were definitely impressing\neverybody watching. Magali and\nSzun Szun were setting brilliantly,\nSandrine and MariJo were blocking\neverything thrown at them, Lucia and\nRapha were attacking the serve like\nmad, and super-subs Anisah and\nIvonne were backing up the defence\nsuperbly! So, things were looking\ngood at this stage.\nThen, the horror set came in l Their professional coach cleverly\nspotted our weak points in the net\nand gave instruction to their two very\ngood American s pikers to attack\nthrough those points (something our\nLondon opponents were never able\nto do). And there was nothing we\ncould do! They just kept on hammering us, one ball after the other, and\nat one stage we were 23-11 behind!\nThis was definitely the only set where\nKent were clearly the better team.\nFinally, in the fourth set, we\nmade some readjustments to the\nteam to tackle those weak points that\ncost us dearly in the previous one,\nand things really got much more bal-an ced. At the start, we lost four\npoints in a row, since the players that\ncame in were not used to playing in\nthose positions, but then we levelled\nthings out and reached a2222 position. At this point everybody was\nclose to a nervous breakdown. You\ncould feel the tension in the air. Kent\nwas surprised to see us managing to\nchange our tactics completely and\ngetting back into the game (they\ncongratulated us in the end for that).\nUnfortunately, our lack of experience\nat the highest level did not help us at\nthis stage, and we let them clinch the\nset 25-22, and as a result they took\nthe match.\nIt was sad, very sad indeed. We\ncould have got that fourth set and\nthen beaten them at the last one. But\nthat wasn't to be. Kent were stronger\non the day. However, the performance of the team put Imperial\nwomen's on the map! As Kent's staff\ntold us in the end, we could have\neasily gone through to the national\nwith such a fantastic team. But we\nwere unlucky with the draw and\ncame up against a strong Kent side.\nNow, we learn from here and try to\ndo it better next year!\nTo finish, I would just like to\nthank to thank all those who came to\nplay and support (especially\nGabriela and Beat), to the brilliant\nteam captain, Sandrine, and to our\nopponents who organised a meal for\nus at the end and who also had\nsome very kind words of support and\nencouragement for our team. It\nmade us feel a little bit better to know\nthe opposition recognised that we\nwere that good.\nArchers on\ntarget\nArchery\nSunday 30th of January was cold\nand windy. Four Imperial College\narchers braved this bitter winter\nmorning to go to the London\nCounty Championships. The shoot\nwas good fun even though Tim\nruined yet another of the clubs\narrows and our archery captain\nmissed the target for the first time\nin two and a half years of shoot-ing.\nOf the quartet shooting, Tim\nand Colin were at their first competition and shot admirably to\ncontribute to the team's third place\nin the county competition. Keith\nshot well again and just missed out\non reaching the 5 0 0 mark. Leo\ncame third in the Ladies Reserve\ncompetition.\nSaturday 5th February was the\nBUSA indoor archery championships at Bath University, and\nwith fingers crossed everyone\nshould have make it there and\nback again with all their arrows in\none piece - and have achieved\nsome good scores too.

    "content": "7 February 2000 * Felix Books 29\nDon't Read This Book if You're Stupid\nTibor Fischer\nIn this selection of seven short stories, Tibor Fischer races us through a selection of Londoners both home and abroad. We meet a failed webpage designer ogling women tanning on the Cote d 'Azur, an unemployed\nWild West enthusiast, and take a look at the underworld of London stand-up comedy. If this were not enough, we also visit a Brixton prison, a German bookshop and Midwest America. Although their activities are differ-ent, there is a common theme to their lives. These are people who have\nnot quite made it.\nFischer relates the downside of London. There is a sense of loneliness and\nhelplessness that pervades the lives of all his characters. More than this,\nhe offers a new look at Londoners themselves - their sharply honed ignoring skills, the cynicism with which they view life, and their contempt for all\nthings linked with tourists.\nDespite its gritty, pessimistic message, this book is a good (almost com-pul sive) read. Fischer's unique ability for clever writing keeps you turning\nthe pages. His stories focus on the moment in much the same way as his\ncharacters live for the now. But, in spite of this, the stories are diverse.\nSome are intimate and personal whereas others are off-hand journalistic\naccounts. Fischer's skill lies in finding that fine line between wit and wis-dom, and treading it with ease. To top it all off he throws in a good deal\nof realism and acceptance of life's per vers i ties. As Fischer is a South Londoner himself, his stories have also gained a good degree of accuracy.\nAdded to this there is a wealth of information on offer. You can learn how\nto pick a driver in the middle of a Romanian civil war, or discover how to\nmake people laugh with just your foreskin. There is even a simple guide\nto being a serial killer.\nThis book has been ten years in the making and includes a number of\nworks previously published in Granta, New Writing and the TLS as well as\nseveral new stories and a novella. However, this is by no means a cobbled\ntogether effort by a desperate writer - each story is able to stand up to a good deal of scrutiny. The title is less to warn off the stupid than the easily offended, and even if you are stupid this is a perfect book to first\nencounter Tibor Fischer.\nFischer's black comedy Under the Frog about the antics of a Hungarian\nbasketball team was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\u2022 Kathehne\nbooks= TUESDAY 8TH BINARY MYTHS 2, Conference Centre, British Library, Euston Road\n1 8 : 1 5 - 1 9 : 3 0 .

    "content": "PreviewJzar-Burden of the Crown (PC)\nI love being a games reviewer - I get to play games like Tzar months\nbefore anyone else has even heard of them.\nOn first seeing Tzar, I have to say I was a little disappointed. On the sur-face, it looks like a direct copy of that classic RTS, Warcraft 2. But while\nmuch of the basic structure and game play is copied almost exactly from\nthe much loved Warcraft, there's enough new stuff here to grab the interest of even the most cynical gamer. The overall effect of the game is kind\nof hard to describe: try to imagine a blend of Age of Empires with Warcraft, and you'd come pretty close (I think). It goes beyond the normal\n\"build farm/mine and get resources\" model of other RTS games - your\npeasants can fish, keep cows and farm crops to get food, trade goods\nwith each other and even gamble in pubs if you want them to. I 've always\nfound god games like Caesar and Pharaoh very addictive, and Tzar does\ngive some of the sense of controlling a whole community you get with\ngames of that type.\nThe most striking thing about Tzar is its depth. The research tree is large,\nand the number of units available is equally big. The game seems to have\nbeen designed with very large-scale combat in mind - I have had fights\nwith the computer with close to a hundred infantry on each side at times.\nPlayed properly, a large game of Tzar will take a long time to finish, but\nwith ever more powerful and expensive units available as you research\nand build new structures, there's always something new to do. Some may\nfind the initial preparation and building a little long-winded, but if you're\nprepared to think about strategy games rather than just blindly clicking\n'attack', Tzar is great fun to play.\nThe single player campaign has twenty-five missions to play, which should\nkeep you busy for a while. The campaign is much more like a role playing game than the traditional RTS campaign - it actually has a storyline\nthat follows through from mission to mission. My only complaint would\nbe that you are often left to wander around the map aimlessly, trying to\nwork out what to do next - which isn't much fun after a while.\nWhile most of the combat in Tzar is limited to charging your swordsmen\nin while your archers fire from way back, there are quite a few specialist\nunits around that require closer control, including some really cool drag-ons. Even if you can't play multiplayer, the computer players are extremely hard to beat. They don't fall into the classic RTS computer player trap\nof always attacking the same bit of your base - they will actually outflank\nyour defenses and attack your resource-gathering peasants if they get a chance. Tzar define t ely seems to be a game to look forward to in the year\n2000.\nFelix \u2022 7 Febuary 2000\nIn association with\ngames u/ ire. com\nA WHOLE NEW WORLD\nDestruction Derby 64 (N64)\nIf you've been looking for a decent smash-em-up racer on the N64 these\npast years, no doubt you've been very disappointed with the results. Put\nsimply, before now there hasn't been one. And while Destruction Derby\n64 from THQ isn't exactly the game we've all been dying for, it's certainly\nthe pick of the current crop out there.\nThe idea behind this game is to race and crash. You get points for passing checkpoints along the tracks, and even more for earth-shuddering\ncollisions between yourself and the rival drivers. There is no finish line as\nsuch - instead cars continue to race until there is only one left standing,\nat which time all the points are totalled up and the winner is announced.\nThus you may find yourself caught in the thick of the action and retire\nearly, only to discover that you accumulated enough points from smashing into your competitors to finish first overall. The problem is that, in\norder to have spectacular collisions, groups of cars start at opposite ends\nand travel in opposite directions. The first collision will result in a gorgeous orgy of grinding metal, and it's great fun to be in there. But, as\nthe race continues and cars drop out, you'll be doing much more driving\nand the chances of collision decline. I often found myself swearing when\nI missed colliding with a car coming from the opposite direction, since it\nmeant I'd have to wait a whole lap before I got another chance to hit\nhim.\nSome of the tracks are arenas, and it's here that you'll lap up the most\nfun from the game. The basic premise in these arenas is just to smash\ninto the other vehicles - there are no checkpoints to pass and the cars are\nall packed in a small enough area, so there is constant action. In multiplayer especially this is a hoot, and you'll be playing these levels more\nthan any of the others.\nThe graphics are alright but we expect more from our machines these\ndays, and it would have been better if we could have seen the damage\nin expansion pak boosted high-res. I absolutely love to see my car taking punishment from it's crashes, and thankfully real-time damage has\nbeen included. However, there simply aren't enough variations in this\ndamage, and since most of the collisions are head on you rarely get to\nsee more than a missing bonnet and an occasional warped back.\nDestruction Derby 64 is a great idea for a game, and initially it's great\nfun too. You'd just expect that little bit more from the game, especially\nwhen it's already had two outings on the Playstation (with a third in the\npipeline). If, like me, you're really into causing damage, you'll like this\ngame whatever, although the feeling that it could have been better will\nalways linger.\nBen Kuthead\n\n"

    "content": "14 Columns Felix \u00bb 7 February 2000\nCUTTING COMMENT\nA far as I know, no one from the\n/ \\ great Imperial College has ever\n/ travelled into space. Now let's look at the stats. Just over five hundred people\nhave been fortunate enough to break free\nfrom our atmosphere (no pedantic isms please)\n- all very skilled, intelligent and healthy individuals. If we were to spread that number over\nthe world's top academic institutions (ignoring\nnationality), then IC surely would have had a few astronauts by now. So, what's going\nwrong? Well, Imperial happens to be located\nin the UK, and our government is somewhat\nvision less when is comes to space ex plo ration.\nAs you all know, America\nheads the way in space.\nDespite having its ,,,g budget slashed for r the seventh consecutive year (last\ntime I heard it / .\nwas around $ 1 3 f billion), the USA\nstill spends\nmore than anyone else. Russia still manages to\nuphold its own squad of cosmonauts to maintain a significant presence as the second\nspace power. The European Space Agency\nsends up its astronauts with either of the two\nleaders, as do individual nations that are participating in particular projects. In the coming\ndecade, expect China to start to put its own\npeople into orbit too. The UK is part of ESA,\nbut doesn't commit to manned space flight.\nThe British National Space Centre will gladly\nboast about Britain's use of Earth Observation\ndata, but useful stuff as it is, it's hardly particularly exciting.\nCritics are constantly questioning the need\nfor space travel, and it seems that British politicians share their scepticism. So why do we (as\na species) bother? I presume everyone has at\nsome stage gazed at the stars. But have you\never really looked at them? I'm not talking\nproper astronomy here, with its associated scientific buff, rather the point where you've been\ngazing at the whole dome of the sky for a while and suddenly it hits you: the depth. At\nthis stage, the stars stop being pretty little pinpricks of light and take on a whole new symbolism (and you don't have to know their\nnames to see this). The moon isn't just a brighter light in the sky - it is another world. As\nthis perception kicks in, the night sky almost\nbecomes 3 D in nature, as the mind begins to\nvisualise the vastness of the universe as well as\nits splendour. As your eyes dilate and the milky\nway becomes ever clearer, you can see your\nplace in the greater scheme of things. Suddenly you can see yourself lying down, hands\nbehind your, head looking up from the surface\nof this tiny but beautiful Earth, circling the sun\n- one insignificant reactor among the billions\nof our galaxy. It's a spectacular feeling. This is\nthe reason to go. Mankind can't be expected\nto sit tight on his home planet when there is\njust so much out there to explore. Columbus\nmust have had a similar sort of vision when he\nstared out across the Atlantic and wondered\nwhat the hell was out there. That urge is built\ninto us - a Darwinian survival of the species\ninstinct, perhaps. Whatever the case, it should\nnot (indeed cannot) be ignored, although\nthose individuals in which it is less expressed\n>/./\nwould perhaps beg to\ndiffer. They are the\ncritics of space\ntravel. Often their I arguments seem /\nto hold weight.\nUse the money to\nfind cures for dis-ease, reduce\ncrime by strengthening the police\n(America isn't the safest place on Earth)\nor else why not clean up our own planet first?\nThe money taken from the space budgets of\nthe big spenders wouldn't all be ploughed\nback into such public services\nby the respective govern-ment s, and any- ,' '\u2022\none would be\ndeluding themselves if\nthey think it\nwould. The sum\nthat did would\nprobably not make\na lot of difference\nanyway, and it\nwould be far\nmore beneficial\nto extract funds\nfrom the military (where there are\nsurely massive eddies where money disappears without having achieved much). Also, by\ncutting space programs you would be removing a lot of inspiration for children and adults\nalike. It's safe to say that, unless we destroy\nourselves, we will eventually do it all - so why\nprolong it? Ironically, it is likely that people will\nonly begin to care more for their planet when\nwe have finally become a proper space-faring\nspecies. Then we will all be able to look back\nat the fragile Earth, recognise its uniqueness\n(at least in the close neighbourhood) and feel\nsentimental enough to care for it. It would cost\nthe UK \u00a3100m to have an astronaut on board\nthe international space station - a sum that initially seems a lot, but in reality is insignificant.\nIt could be taken from the treasury without the\nblink of an eye, or else funded by various ministries and the lottery. Even private sponsorship\ncould be sought. Other economically less\nsound nations take far greater pride in space\nflight. Germany and France have had numerous space travellers, and yet our single effort,\nHelen Sharman, was funded primarily from\ncommercial sources. Its time for the UK's policies to change.\nWhat will really\n\u00bb-,\u201e kick start\nspace travel\nis its com-mercia lisa tion. When\nsomeone discovers a way of\nmaking a net profit\nfrom a space bound\nactivity, it will be like\nthe Californian gold\nrush. Be it space tourism\nor mining on the moon,\nit's all coming our way.\nExpect holidays in space\nwithin fifteen years - and much\nsooner for those who are prepared to fork out a fortune for a ticket. The X prize is offering\n$10m to the first private company\nthat powers a crew into low orbit\nand then does it again within two\nweeks, and it has many entrants all\nwith new concepts designed to lower\nthe cost of reaching orbit. The\nwinner is expected within ten\nyears. Government\nagencies will continue to make the news\nthough, with a manned flight to\nMars as early as\n2 0 2 0 . Interestingly, we (the present IC student cont in gent) will all be at the appropriate age\n( \u2014 40) for such a trip...\nFor the moment, that spectacular view of\nEarth - with no visual borders between countries - is on iy available to a lucky few. I 've\nalways believed that 'astronaut' was the best\npossible job in the world, and it was even my\naim to become one at one stage. Since I can't see myself doing a PhD that option di sap pears, but it is still my ambition to travel into\nspace. Somehow, I don't think that will be difficult. I see it likely that nearly all of us IC students will one day enjoy the sensation of\nweightlessness and witness a sunrise over the\ncurvature of the Earth.\n\n"

Although it lasts only one hour, it is one of the most intense and moving performances London theatre has to offer. Genius in its simplicity, the\nplay is concerned with Krapp, played by the fantastic John Hurt, on his 69th birthday. As he records a retrospect of the year that just passed, he replays\npassages at random from the earlier tapes. For the occasion, he plays the\ntape he made thirty years ago. As Krapp remembers the past events of his\nyouth, we are treated to at or tu rous and humbling experience, which\nexplores the ravages and deterioration caused by the passage of time.\nJohn Hurt is immensely powerful as the aging and cantankerous Krapp. His\ngravely, chipped voice crackles out from the stage, beautifully capturing\nevery intonation in Beckett's script. An overhead lamp illuminates a simple\nset, consisting of just a chair and a desk. The enveloping darkness (which\nsurrounds all) gives the audience a sense of loneliness, both Krapp's and\ntheir own\nSamuel Beckett was born in Dublin in 1906, and his better known works\ninclude Waiting for Godot and End Game. He wrote nineteen plays in total\n- all of which were performed at the Beckett festival at the Barbican last\nsummer - and although he is renowned for being difficult, this is one of his\nmore accessible pieces.\nThe play is highly autobiographical, with subtle references from Beckett's own painful past, which leaves the feeling that what is experienced is an\nintensely fragile, private world. By introducing the tape recorder, he explores\nthe use of worlds as a refuge from the gross facts of experience. The pathos\nof life and the search for meaning, repressed in society, are openly dissect-ed. Through Krapp's self-reflection, the audience are individually challenged to evaluated their own solitude and suffering. By switching off the\ntape when painful memories are reached, we are shown his sensitivity to the\nloss, which is glossed over by the narrative. He denies certain parts of his\nlife and dwells on others. The play could be termed as \" post-modern\" (an\nexcellent word to drop into conversations at parties) in that it doesn't attempt to answer the awesome questions which it raises. Indeed, it suggests that there is no universal answer, and that life is spent attempting to\navoid this realisation. It is the responsibility of the individual to find meaning in existence. Hard going! It is the introspection this provokes that makes\nit such an unsettling and powerful play. If you think you can handle it, then\nI highly recommend it.\nYayoi Kusama\nSerpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens\nUntil: 19 March\nAdmission: Free\nA room painted in acid-trip yellow and full of giant tubes and blobs, as in\na dreamscape. This is really fabulous installation art! After you have taken\noff your shoes (are you entering a Buddhist temple?), you can actually\nwalk about within the sculpture. Or how about the large octagonal box.\nLook through its porthole and you see an infinitely reflected kaleidoscope\nof flashing fairground lights.\nAll this interactive art and more can be found in this diverse exhibition from\nthe artist, poet and novelist Yayoi Kusama. Born 70 years ago in Japan,\nKusama grew up during the darkness of WW2 and studied art in its ruined\naftermath. She emigrated to the USA, stopping first in Seattle (apparently\nto see Frasier and Niles!) before moving to New York City in the summer\nof 1958. Pre-1958, she worked mostly in the classical Japanese style\n(God of the Wind, 1 955), but the move to New York was the shock of the\nnew that drove her work to Western abstraction.\nIn New York, she fell under the influence of the leading lights of Pop Art,\ngetting to know artists like Claes Oldenburg and Andy Warhol. Even\ntoday, many of her works (Dots Obsession, 1996) continue to show the\nmonumental influence of classic Oldenburg. The Surrealist and European\nMinimalist movements have also informed her work; she even exhibited\nwith the greatest of minimalists, Yves Klein.\nHowever, Kusama did not simply churn out pale imitations. By her own\nadmission, her art is uniquely informed by the bouts of psychotic mental\nillness that she has struggled with since her adolescence. It is easy to see\nthe resonances of her often tormented mind: there is something deeply\ndisconcerting and d is orientating. Driving Image (1959-1964), a series of\nmannequins painted in vibrant polka dots, struck me as alarmingly s in is ter.\nHer countless sculptures encrusted with penises, from clothes to a life-size\nrowing boat, are amusing - but they do carry a disturbing charge (if only\nto the male half of the population). This is especially the case when viewed\nin the light of the un an aes thetis ed corrective surgery performed by the\ninfamous Mrs Bobbitt! Is this the revenge of the wives and girlfriends\nagainst all the chauvinists? Kusama may well have intended it to be taken\nthis way, for she was forever slowed by the terrible treacle of sexism, both\nin Japan and in the USA. But maybe it is also that terrible treacle which\nmakes her work so fascinating...\nAlly-pally Esq William Burns\n\n"

    "content": "[ Big Issue Felix \u00ab 7 February 2000\nHalls DAVID ROBERTS\nWhen Beit Hall is finally completed, this summer\n(hopefully no more than three or four weeks\nbehind schedule) it will be the end of the first\nstage in the College's planned redevelopment of\nits hall stock. Over the next few years, the rolling\nprogramme will see the refurbishment of Southside, Weeks and the entirety of Evelyn Gardens,\nalongside the sale of Montpelier, Garden,\nBrabazon and Olave House, with the ultimate\naim of producing a set of halls which can be both\nprofitable for conferences and suitable for the\nstudents of the next twenty years.\n[ history] The main problem with the College's halls (aside\nfrom the innate problems of the cost of land in\nSW7 and the difficulty of getting planning permission to do anything new) is that they're all\ncoming to the end of their lifetimes at a very similar time.\nIgnoring Beit for the moment, the first of the\nCollege's existing stock of halls to open was\nWeeks, which came into being in October 1959.\nDesigned as the first stage in a comprehensive\nbuilding programme which would see similar\nhalls surrounding Princes Gardens, it only came\ninto being through a \u00a3150 000 donation from\nVickers (designed to provide affordable accommodation for students with engineering scholar-ships). This small start was followed four years\nlater by Southside, with the first residents moving\nin on May 1 1th1963( a mere few months behind\nschedule), and then Linstead, which was officially\nopened in July 1968. The latter cost \u00a3300 000\nto construct, a large portion of which was donated by an anonymous benefactor, who insisted\nthat the hall should offer its residents catering -hence the fact that Linstead still provides one\nmeal per day.\nIn the same period, Imperial also started to\nbuy up the houses around Evelyn Gardens, with\nthe first set (numbers 54-56) purchased at the\nbeginning of 1967. The \"Student Houses\" were\ndesigned to be different to halls, in that they\nwould be student run (usually by senior members\nof the Union) and financially separate from other\nCollege accommodation. The buildings were\nbroken down into a series of small flat units,\nwhich were supposed to house members of all\nyears, with a heavy emphasis placed on postgraduates (in order to ensure that the buildings\nwere occupied for as much of the year as p ossi ble, and thus keep rents down), at a rate slightly\nhigher than that in the Princes Gardens halls.\nOver the next few years, the remaining parts of\nIC's current holdings around the Gardens was\nleased, but as pressure on bed spaces rose, their\nadministration moved into line with the other\nbuildings.\nAfter this period, the rapid expansion came to\nan end, and (mergers aside) the College has only\ngained a few bed spaces in the last twenty-five\nyears. The only hall to have been added is Montpelier, just off Knightsbridge, which was acquired\nas a postgraduate residence back in 1981. Having endured a series of health scares, the building only just survived threatened closure a few\nyears ago, when a small-scale refurbishment took\nplace. Although it has been slated for sale for the\nlast few years, the overflow spaces it provides (to\nreplace those lost by the rolling refurbishment\nprogramme) are now essential, and consequently the sale has now been pushed back to July\n2002.\n[ solutions] As previously stated, the College's problem is\none of design: all of the Princes Gardens buildings were constructed to have a lifetime of something in the region of thirty years (in common with\nmost large concrete buildings of that time) and\nconsequently they're all heading towards the end\ntheir usable lives. The Southside renovation, in\nparticular, has been forced upon the College\nmore as a solution to the fact that the building's falling apart - and although knocking the whole\nthing down and starting again might seem like a preferable solution, it's one that's sadly un avail able, as the building is Grade II listed (as a classic example of its kind). Consequently, the College is investing \u00a31 4.5 million to fully refit Southside, complete with en-suite bathrooms and\ngreatly increased cooking facilities. Although\nthese changes will result in rent increases (of\naround \u00a35 a week, or \u00a3165 a year), they're an\nessential part of Imperial's business plan, as they\nwill allow much higher rates to be charged for\nconference guests. Moreover, the College planners insist that all students will be demanding en\nsuite facilities, and thus the majority of rooms in\nall new halls must have individual showers and\ntoilets - hence the large number of en suite rooms\nthat are being included in the new Beit.\nThe need to refurbish, however, means that\nthe programme will not end with Southside.\nWeeks is due for \u00a31.1 million facelift the year\nafter next, whilst Evelyn Gardens is undergoing a \u00a312.5 million rolling refit, which should overhaul\nmost of the older buildings into properties suitable for modern living (and modern conference\nguests). Meanwhile, due to the College's policy\nthat all non-academic areas (sports, residences,\ncatering etc) must break-even, the IC accommodation will be forced to sell-off a series of the\nmore remote halls, in order to cover the massive\ncost of rebuilding. As a result, the College's investment programme schedules both Garden\nand Brabazon Hall for sale in summer 2001, with\nMontpelier and Olave House to follow twelve\nmonths later.\nAs the graph below shows, this will cause an\never increasing room shortage, which could seriously threaten Imperial's much prized guarantee\nof accommodation for every first year. The current\nsolution to the problem involves discussions with\nlocal housing associations which are designed to\nlocate suitable flats and properties in which to\nhouse next year's fresher s and those deemed by\nthe College to be deserving of a bed (for exam-ple, final year medics who enrolled at St Mary's are currently entitled to a place in hall, as are\nErasmus students). In the long term, the College's only solution to the problem appears to be their\nhope that the number of first years choosing to\ntake a place in hall will fall as a result of the\nimposition of fees.\n\n"

However, the need for\nsupport from the highest levels of\nCollege, coupled with the need to\nfind an additional \u00a3 1 4 0 0 0 of\nfunding, means that the battle to\nsecure the position will be a complex and long winded one.\nAlthough the sabbatical position of ICSM Union President was\ndue to be relinquished at the end of\nthis academic year (to be replaced\nby a non-sabbatical officer), a combination of student support and\nLondon-wide changes have led current incumbent Becky England to\ndraw up a set of proposals asking\nthe College to accept the retention\nof the sabbatical status. Despite the\nfact that the role is a Union pos i tion, College support is essential,\nas without it any student taking a year out would not be guaranteed\na place the following year.\nBefore the series of mergers\nwhich created the School of Medicine in 1997, only one of the major\ncomponents, the Charing Cross\nand Westminster School, had a sabbatical - however, as the old\n(smaller) schools were all based\nICSM do the meeting thang\naround one campus, coordinating\nstudent activity was a much simpler\nprocess. Now, medical students\nare spread across four main teaching sites, and according to a draft\ncopy of Becky England's proposal\n(which is due to be presented to\nCollege Council later this week), \"A central figure is needed to collate\nopinion and then express this at the\nrelevant committees... only a sabbatical can hope to fulfil this role\".\nThe real sticking point in the\nplans, however, is likely to be the\nquestion of financing. Although\nICU President Natasha Newton\ninsists that \"We need to get permission to have the sabbatical first,\nand then think about details later\",\nPhoto: Jonas\nthe issue of who is going to pay the\nsabbatical salary - approximately\n\u00a313 5 0 0 to \u00a314 0 0 0 once taxes\nhave been included - is one that is\ncertain to be prominent in the\nminds of many of those debating\nthe issue. Currently, the Union are\nonly being funded for five sabbaticals, and thus the sixth salary (gen-e rated by the addition of the Education & Welfare position) must be\nfound by making cut-backs in other\nareas. ICU insists that this situation\ncannot continue, and Becky England has expressed a hope that the\nMedical School itself may be able\nto provide funding - but with ICSM\nfinances currently believed to be in\nthe same precarious state as those\nof the Union, this would seem\nunlikely. Whatever happens, how-ever, ICU's Deputy President\n(Finance & Services), Ian Clifford,\ninsists that external funding must be\nfound, stating adamantly that\n\"We're not going to pay\".\nAlthough the plan is fully supported by ICU, there is still a long\nway to go before any suggestion\ncan become a reality, and it may\nprove a struggle to force a decision\nthrough the College in time for the\nusual round of elections. The key\nissue seems to be one of support\nfrom senior staff in the Medical\nSchool - if they throw their weight\nbehind the proposals, it is thought\nthat the College will look\nfavourably on the proposal, and\nconsequently the Union is seeking\nthe help of ICSM Principle Chris\nEdwards.\nOne of the biggest factors supporting the proposal is a comparison with the other medical schools\nacross London. Of the four large\ngroups created in the 1997 round\nof mergers, all four currently have\nsabbatical positions specifically\ndesignated to deal with medical\nissues. More importantly, however,\nonly ICU plans to remove the position at the end of the year, which\nclearly suggests that, right across\nLondon, the process of integration\nis taking far longer than anyone initially expected.\nWant to send a message to someone special?

Or are there some images that are so\nunacceptable as to warrant curbing the freedom of\nthe press by banning them? Underexposed is a collection of images which are... well, underexposed -due to the fact that they have been banned. Some,\nI felt, should be banned - but the vast majority\nseemed to have suffered from a shady political\ninfluence. For example, images of the two black\nathletes who did the Black Power salute at the\n1968 Olympics were banned in the US. Alongside\nthis, you'll find pictures of the most awful famines\nand human rites disasters from around the world -all pictures which a higher power has decided that\nyou may not see.\nNot only were the pictures horrendous as images in\nthemselves, they were often horrendous examples\nof they way humans treat each other.

Perhaps it was\nNazi soldiers measuring an old man's nose -bizarre as this may sound, it was common practice\nto measure noses, as a big nose was seen as conclusive proof of Judaism. It was the image of such\na bizarre practice, coupled with the fact that we\nnow know what will have happened to the man if\nindeed his nose was too big. The next picture along\nwas a train packed with those on the way to the\nconcentration camps.\nThe images are often disturbing - so why bother\ngoing?

Maybe just getting a taste of the\npower that they have is as close as you can get -this will open your eyes.

There is a rather obvious parallel; they are both alleged to have\nkilled their wives, having both suspected their\npartners of \"playing the field\". The production was a devised piece of drama, intent on\nexamining the feelings that the murderous\nhusband has towards his wife. There was no\ndoubt that the crimes were condemned and\nportrayed as the most terrible of acts. However, the main focus was not to persuade the\naudience of the hideousness of the crimes -the production was far braver than that. We\nwere given the point of view of the jealous,\nmurderous, husband. At no time were the\nactions condoned - but glimpses of understanding were there. OJ was portrayed as an\ninsecure, jealous man - the love of his media\n\"colourless\" face was of paramount importance to him, yet it left him rootless.\nThere was only one actor in the show (well,\nthere were two others who did a bit of random dancing at the beginning, but that does-n't count) and there is no doubt that Frank\nSheppard is a brilliant actor - he was the\nshow. He would speak as the OJ Simpson we\nknow for most of the time, but this was mixed\nwith some hard hitting sections of Othello. His\ndarker, unconscious, side emerged as the\njealousy increased, and we would also hear\nthe voice of the \"nigga\" from the back streets,\nalways there to remind him of his roots (and\nthe fact that he has betrayed them). The strain\nof OJ's shallow world and the fact that he saw\nhis wife as more of a trophy of acceptance\nfrom the white middle classes was obvious\nand poignant.

We would like to assure\nreaders that all of the very few people who got their cards on the day of\nthe EG M were checked against registry details and for added security\ncollege swipe cards were also\nchecked. (Anyone who turned up on\nthe night with registry details would\nhave been and indeed were issued\ncards.)\nThese students are all based off\ncampus and thus could only obtain\ntheir cards on the day itself. In the\npast the Med school Union has distributed the cards. This system, long\nplanned and well thought out, was a marked improvement! Having photo\nID is also a step up from the current\nSouth Ken routine.\nYours, Tasha Newton, Tim\nTrailor, Kevin Butcher, Ian Clifford\nFINANCIAL FIASCO\nDear Dave\nFirstly congratulations on last\nweek's issue, one of the best in\nrecent years. It seems that there was\na strong financial theme running\nthrough many of the stories, which\nlinks in very nicely with the main\nheadline. The College financial\nstatements are, as you suggest,\nalways worth a quick gander, but\nwhile being legally unimpeachable,\nthey do not give anything like the\nwhole picture. We do not, for exam-ple, see the par lou s state of Catering, because it is lumped in with the\nResidences cash cow. The same\ncould be said of Conferencing.\nCatering, which has always been in a hole, should reach the Earth's core\nnext year if the a proportion of the\nSCR costs fall at its feet as the\nincome projections for the refurbished facility miss the costs by a mile. We don't see how many of\nthose 362 lucky people of \u00a350,000\nper year are in academic positions. It\nis no secret that many people on fairly middle ranking grades in Sherfield\nare earning in that region. We do not\nsee the calamitous financial management in certain divisions of the\nICSM. For all this and more, you\nneed the infamous Management\nand Planning Group reports. Harder\nto obtain than a virgin in a maternity\nward, it is high time these were pub-li shed. Next year, will the statements\nmention how the College has been\nrunning an overdraft since August\nbecause it paid every supplier's bill\nrather than transfer the information\nto the universally dreadful new\nfinance system?\nBreakpoint, uncharacteristically\nlucid and understandably concerned\nabout the Hall refurbishments, suggests that we are in no-free-lunch\nterritory, and he's in part correct. Beit\nHall, refurbished for the 2000 British\nAssociation meeting, could prove\nvery damaging to our wealth. Budgeted for on highly questionable pre-diction s, it will be first to clobber the\nstudents if things go awry. Thankfully,\nno such nonsense is being entertained for Southside, which will be\npaid for by the disposal of Montpellier, Brabazon and Garden Halls.\nAny rent hikes there will then simply\nbe profiteering by the College rather\nthan any necessity borne of impending doom. It is a great relief that this\nsilly conferencing model seems to\nhave been put back in its box before\nexposing the College (ie. us) to\nunacceptable risk.\nAnd then we have the LSE/IC\nmerger. This is brilliant news. Yes, it\nmakes perfect sense, but much more\nimportantly, it suggests that IC may\nsoon have a Rector who is prepared\nto challenge the old orthodoxies and\nwho will not tolerate the waste and\ninefficiency that is sadly Imperial's hallmark. Many a good man has\ngone native here. Now we have\nsomeone firing salvos before even\nstarting. God help Sherfield.\nAll the best,\nSimon Baker\nChem PG MINIBUS MISMANAGEMENT?\nDear Dave,\nFurther to comments on the\ncatering service provided by college\nand the union (letters 17/1, 24/1), I have discovered yet another service\nthat is available externally at a lower\nprice. Since the increase in cost of\nunion minibus hire from \u00a3150 per\nweekend to \u00a3190, it now works out\n\u00a315-\u00a320 cheaper to hire from a commercial hire-firm. Granted, this\noption is greatly facilitated by the\nprovision of union insurance for drivers under 2 5 , but it still begs the\nquestion of how a non-profit making\norganisation can cost more than a profit making one. An added bonus\nis that the cancellation charges for\nthe commercial firm are approximately % of the union's exorbitant\nfee. Perhaps it's time to seriously\nconsider Becky Leigh's suggestion to\ncontract out such services.\nYours,\nColm Carroll\nChem PG CHRISTIANITY FIGHTS BACK\nDear Sir,\nThe article last week under the\ntitle of 'Cutting Comment' has given\nme some concern over the misrepresentation of the Christian understanding of God. Andy Vivian states\nthat God is all-good, all-powerful\nand all-knowing. This is indeed true.\nHe asks how this God can allow evil\nto exist. But he ignores the understanding of God as one who is full of\nlove for us. This God could destroy\neveryone who does anything that is\nevil. He could end the world now\nand bring an end to evil now. Yet he\ndoes not. His love for us is such that\nhe will allow each person time,\nchance after chance to love him, to\nchoose the good option. His love is\nso great, as we are told, that he sent\nJesus to die for us. Those who turn to\nhim receive from him such unlimited\namounts of love, which we can never\nearn, that he will forgive us, and\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.\n\n"

    "content": "7 February 2000 \u00ab Felix Music 21\nNixon\n(City Slang)\nThere aren't many albums that come with a list of recommended reading. Well, there was Moby's Play, but\nhe's a bit of a nut case: \"If you eat meat you're a bas-tard\". That sort of thing. As you may expect with a recording called Nixon, the literature has a crooked-past-presidential feel to it, with titles like Trick/ Dick And\nThe Pink Lady - but it does say \"suggested\", so I didn't hot-foot it down to the library. Maybe you're supposed\nto read these books to get an idea of the theory behind\nthe album. Whatever, I didn't. End of story.\nI really don't know what to classify Nixon as. There's a country thing going on in there somewhere, a little slice\nof Blind Melon's particular brand of rock, a kind of\nCounting Crows vibe (but more depressed) and a whole\nmelange of other stuff. But it's those three major elements that are easiest to spot. Kurt Wagner's sometimes\nhigh-pitched, distressed vocals are very similar to Shannon Hoon's, there is extensive use of slide guitar and\nstrings (fiddle as well as the more classical sweeping\norchestral sounds), and the subject matter and lyrics are\nas abstract and beautiful as Adam Duritz's. Tracks such\nas (Fearless) The Book I Haven't Read, The Butcher Boy\nand The Old Gold Shoe are prime examples.\nThe melodies that are present throughout give you a smiley yet melancholic sensation, as if you know that\nsomething good won't last, or that feeling you get when\nyou've done a naughty thing that you're bound to get\ncaught for. It's that fusion of contentment and woeful-ness that makes the album that tiny bit better than aver-age. I think that they may have overplayed the whole\ndespair business, because when it came to the final\ntrack I was sobbing into a tub of ice cream and feeling\nlonely. OK, so maybe I'm over exaggerating, but it\nwould be a terrible mistake to listen to this while on\nProzac or lithium carbonate - you'd be climbing the\nwalls looking for someone to talk to that wasn't inside\nyour head. On the other hand, if you aren't prone to\ndepression, have a listen.\nfrequency Raissa\nBeliever\n(Polydor)\nRaissa is the latest bright young thing to emerge into the glaring lights of the UK pop\nscene. She's pretty, has a great voice, and has a batch of catchy melodic ditties ready\nto woo the public with. Sounds like a winning formula. But is it any good?\nAlanis Morrissette is the name that jumps into my mind as soon as Raissa starts to\nsing. Her songs and style are strongly reminiscent of Jagged Little Pill. Take away most\nof the angst and put in acoustic guitars and swoosh ing strings with a 'modern' beat,\nand you're there. Some of the tracks also sound a bit like Madonna circa Ray of Light,\nespecially Beautiful Glassy Creature.\nBeliever is nice to listen to. Undemanding and unobtrusive, it makes for good background music. I played it to my girlfriend who said it was \"absolutely brilliant\", so\nmaybe I'm missing something. Certainly the music is distinctly un-masculine. It can\nbe very touching, and songs like Step On Up bring a lump to the throat when Raissa\ngently coaxes us to \"Step on up, to the stars / to the stars\" over melting strings and\ngently plucked acoustic guitars.\nThe album does grow on you after a few listens - always a good sign. It implies that\nthere is added depth there somewhere, even if you can't spot it the first time. My\nfavourite track is Believer, and I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't released as a single soon. The only track that has been released as a single, How Long Do I Get is\nactually one of the less impressive. It seems quite bland compared to the rest of the\nalbum, but judging from last weeks Top of the Pops, that's what gets in the charts\nthese days. Either that or Steps clones. Steps. Of all the people to copy, is it really\nworth copying Steps? The whole appeal of Steps is their unique and open simplicity,\nplus I couldn't put up with more than one. Piss off Scooch.\nI love Raissa's cute English accent that creeps in from time to time. There's no doubt\nthat she is vocally talented - her voice is great, and her adorable, soft, brown eyes\nstaring out at me from the CD cover almost say, \" Go on, give this five, you know you\nwant to.\"\nTowards the end of the album it all starts to get a bit weird (relatively), with distorted,\ncomputerised vocals. Electronic bleeps mix with a slightly breakbeat rhythm. I like this\nbit, especially the track She Bubble, as it is a lot less conventional than the rest of the\nalbum, and it hints that there is more to Raissa than meets the eye.\nOverall this is formulaic - it's not particularly original or even new. But it's done well,\nby a talented performer, and it's easy to listen to. And since when has originality mattered to the record-buying masses?\nChristian Tom 6\n\n"

Hence our visit.\nDue to circumstances beyond our\nself-control, we had no minibus for\nthe weekend, so three hire-cars were\nobtained. Driving in a manner consistent with high speed, Steve and\nJeremy managed the unheard-of feat\nof reaching the hall with half an hour\nto spare before the pubs shut. Everyone else rolled up about an hour\nlater.\nSaturday morning and, with a minimum of faff, everyone scattered\nin pursuit of extreme activity. Grinding our teeth at the lack of vertical ice\nto climb, we settled for a quick (wet\nand slimy) Grade 11+ gill-scramble\nfollowed by rock-climbing. During\nsome intermediate gear-shopping in\nKeswick, Andy stunned the club by\nbuying new stickies and Steve confused the club by buying a boiler-suit\nembroidered with his name and, for\nsome reason, the words \"Vigan\nMotors\". Meanwhile party No 2 were\nwending their way up Sharp Edge on\nBlencathra. \"Nicest scrambling in the\nLake District\", apparently.\nThose short winter days meant\nthat everyone arrived back at the hut\nwith time to spare, and a restrained\nmeal (consisting of a mere three\ncourses) was knocked up in next-to-no-time by Jeremy, our Part-Time\nStrolling Catering Officer Of No\nFixed Abode. Mallet, despite not\ncoming on the trip, excelled himself\n(as usual) by providing a giant double chocolate cake with a replica of\nthe club logo, sculpted in two-tone\nchocolate, on top. Nice. A five-hour\npub session ensued.\nSunday was \"more-of-the-same\"\nday: one party off to scramble up\nHelvellen and down Striding Edge,\nanother to do a couple of difficult\nscrambles on Doves Nest Crag in\nBorrowdale. Right opposite, Jeremy\nand Andy found a long, heavily ver-glassed \"Diff\" on Raven's Crag.\nDespite the mile between the two\nparties, curious echos meant that\nAndy (belaying from the first stance)\nand Steve (noshing at the foot of a Grade III scramble) could converse\nalmost normally: normally in this\ncase meaning shouting \"Omlette!\"\nat each other. Back at the hut and,\nwith mere moments left before our\nsouthward journey, Claire rushed in\nwith the news that ice-climbers had\nbeen sighted on Helvellen. \"Arse\",\nwe said.\nIf these tales of daring-do and\ncustard inspire you to emulate our\nOlympian exertions, we'd be delighted to have you join us on one of our\nmerry jaunts.

Yet again the IC\nladies storm through another\nmatch. The opposition were\nchunky, but we were funky. Well\nfunky in fact. The day was action\npacked with excitement. After\nspending most of the morning\nchasing Chelsea players to sign our\nmatch ball, we were slightly disappointed when the names rubbed off\nafter 9 0 minutes of thwacking.\nAnother topic open to discussion\nwas the ref. Upon scouring all the\nlocal nursing homes for a suitable\ncandidate, captain Helga decided\nupon the most senile, blind, deaf,\nand most likely to have a coronary\nOAR\nAs for the match, the IC ladies\nplayed with the kind of superior\nstyle that has been becoming a habit lately. The forwards had a field day, with goal scoring dominance taking effect from kick-off.\nClark Kent's double hat-trick left\nthe opposition reeling with humi li ation, while the electric feeling of\nadrenaline running through every\nvessel in Kent's body was felt by\nthe rest of the team. Tina \"I 'll-d rink-you-under-the-table-and-then-leg-it\" followed suit with\nanother hat-trick that sealed victory for a deserving IC team.\nThe opposition's attempts at\nretaliation were tres poor. They\nsomehow managed to score two\ngoals due to the referee bestowing\nextreme generosity on a losing\nteam, courtesy of his own blatant\nshort-sightedness. And all this\ndespite lines woman extraordinary\nNona's frantic yelling and waving\nof the flag. The self-same blind ref\ncreated a slightly panicky moment\nfor Hacker Harp, by beckoning her\nwith dod gy finger movements for a completely above board (not)\ntackle. But luckily things didn't go\nthe Beckham way.\nIn a recent interview, the IC\nladies declared that they relished\nthe winning feeling.

On arrival we signed\nin and picked up our ski's. Venturing out onto the slope for a couple of practice runs, we were\nrelieved to find that the slope was\nin far better condition than we\nusually find it on a Wednesday\nafternoon, with all the sprinklers\non full blast. Soon the course was\nset up and we started the long\nwait for our numbers to be called.\nEven with one run taking the\nfastest skiers a tad under twenty\nseconds, we were numbers 8 6 -89, so we were faced with a considerable wait up at the top of\nWycombe Summit - exposed to\nthe wind, things (as usual) got\nquite cold.\nEventually our numbers were\ncalled, and Rosey made his way to\nthe start gate. After putting in a reasonable run on a very varied\ncourse, he was followed by Bywater, Pete Holt and finally club captain Sarah Hughes. Sarah managed to get her own back on\nRosey, after he beat her in the previous race in the series. This was\nfollowed by another immense wait\nfor the second run. While waiting\n- this time inside in the bar - we\nnoticed that a large number of the\nvery best skiers were just trying to\ngo too fast, and many were crashing out. After the second run, in\nwhich everyone managed to put\nin a quicker time, we were halfway\nup the lift, when we heard the\nunexpected announcement,\n'Imperial are currently leading the\nteam event' We realised that this\nmust have been because we had\nbeen the first team to get everyone down both runs so far. There\nwas only one team yet to go who\ncould beat us - UCL. As our team\nwas slightly too small (we should\nhave had five skiers) if UCL could\nget the whole team down, no matter if they were slower than us,\nthey would have it. Sure enough,\nthey all made it down intact. We\nonly had the dual slalom to go, hardly one of our team's strong\npoints - even with a ringer from\nUCL. We were knocked out in the\nfirst round (obviously our notorious false starts - a legacy from\nlast years president - weren't quite\naudacious enough).

The first half came and went,\nwith us going to half time with a10 lead. After a rousing team talk,\nwe engaged our brains and\nstormed into the second half. Oh yes. Care bear baby fresher Helen\nscored some beautiful goals (four\nin all), before her donkey genes\nbecame prominent - she managed\nto miss four open goals like a knob. Jo and her flow had as to rmer of a match tackling like a spinning-top type thing.

Last year we\ngot absolutely trashed in the shield\ncompetition, so expectations\nweren't high.\nTheir scrum was eight fat\nmamas, and they must have been\ntwice our weight - but we stuck\nwith it and gave as good as we\ngot. Size isn't everything you know\n- even when you have \"The Big\nOne!\"( Kryzi) on your side.\nTheir backs weren't that good\neither, and their only tactic was to\ngive it to their forwards and hope\nthey had enough weight to get\nthrough.\nWhenever we got it to our\nIn Brief\nwings, they had loads of space\nand caused havoc. After five min-ute s, all our training paid off and\nAli looped around to score our first\ntry.\nAfter much hard work and\nloads of scrum s, Ling got the ball\non the wing and went on a brilliant\nrun to score. They then got a try\nback before half time, and the\nscore stayed the same for most of\nthe second half, until Ali eventually broke through to score once\nagain.\nJust before the end they\nploughed over the try line without\nground the ball - but the ref\nawarded a try anyway, and Miriam\nsaid \"Mae'rd y far nw r yn *******\ndd all!\" In Brief\nIn Brief In Brief\nRifle Club\nAt the end of the last term, six\nmembers of the ICU Rifle and Pistol Club entered the West Kent\nRifle League's Prince William of\nWales competition.\nOur highest placed shooter\nwas Guy Dewhirst, who came 9th in D class, with a score of 286 out\nof 300.

    "content": "7 February 2000 \u2022 Felix News 3\nRacist graffiti in hall Fees battle continues SUNIL RAO\nA number of residents in Linstead\nHall, Princes Gardens, were\nshocked to discover racist graffiti\nand comments defacing a hall\nblackboard and, name tags on\nroom doors last month.\nThe acts were first discovered on\nSaturday, January 15. A student visiting the room of an Asian friend\nfound that their name tag had been\ndefaced. A quick check soon\nrevealed that the tags of about\ntwenty other Asian residents - in par-ti cula r, those whose name tags suggested they were obviously Asianhad been similarly defaced, and\nthat an offensive message tar getting Asians had been written on the\nblackboard on Level 1, the hall's Lower Gallery.\nThe defaced tags were collected\ntogether and the matter reported to\nthe sub wardens immediately. The\nblackboard was scrubbed clean, but\nthe offending messages reappeared\nlater on that evening - discovered by\ntwo students returning from Basics\nPizzeria, after being away for fifteen\nminutes. This had led to strong suspicions that a resident must have\nbeen responsible.\nIf it was an inside act committed\nby a resident, the consequences\nwould be fairly serious for the student (or students) concerned - with\nalmost certain expulsion not just\nfrom Linstead but from College\nitself. At the moment, the matter has\nbeen reported to the police and\nsecurity are apparently keeping a close watch on the situation, but no\nfurther acts of similar vandalism\nhave been noted.\nThe next day saw the late-night\ndiscovery that the blue sign saying\n\"Linstead Hall\" outside the hall had\nbeen defaced with a message similar in tone, written using white correction fluid. Stickers advocating\nwhite supremacist group Combat\n18 were found around the residence, causing considerable concern amongst residents.\nAt the time of going to press, the\nincidents had not recurred and no\nculprit had been found. Warden Dr\nJon Marangos was unable to comment on the issue other than to condemn racism and any racist act in\ngeneral, but the opinions of individual Asian residents ranged from \"it\nmust have just been a tasteless\nprank\" to \"whoever did it deserves a good beating-up from our posse.\"\nThe apparent absence of any overt\nthreats or abuse directly tar getting particular residents thus far, and the\nfact that there have not been any\nfurther messages of this kind mean\nthat not a great deal can be done\napart from monitoring the situation.\nLina Nawas, are app in Linstead\nHall, commented that whoever\nresponsible must have been \"really\nlow to stoop to that level\", and\naffirmed that those responsible\nshould be \"severely pun ii shed and\nkicked out of College\" for their activities. ICU President Tasha Newton,\nherself a resident in Linstead Hall,\nsaid that if it turned out that those\ninvolved were actually racist stu-dents, it would be \"very sad\" given\nthe \"more interesting backgrounds\"\nthat many students here at Imperial\nhail from. Many students Felix has\nspoken to have expressed incredulity\nand open horror, disgust and shame\nthat such a tasteless act could be\ncommitted by students at Imperial.\nJIM G EACH There has been a series of cases of\nstudents rebelling against the\ntuition fee system. About 15 students from Oxford University have\nbeen expelled for refusing to pay\ntheir fees, and more recently, several members of the School of\nOriental and African Studies\n(SOAS) - one of the UK's top ten\nuniversities - have also decided\nthat the cost of education is too\nmuch, and said they will not pay\neither. Students occupied the\nSchool's Administration building\nlast month, causing the School to\nclose for a day. University College\nLondon Union considered supporting the occupation, but the proposal was vetoed at an emergency\ngeneral meeting.\nFor students at IC who can\nafford their tuition fees, but refuse\nto pay them, the College's policy is\nto not allow them to move on to\nthe next year. Kevin Butcher, Deputy\nPresident (Education and Welfare)\nexplained that by Christmas last\n(academic) year, approximately\nforty students still hadn't paid that\nfee instalment, but by the end of\nthe year, the figure had been\nreduced to just two or three. These\nstudents did not have the academic ability to pass that year, and so\ncould not graduate to the next year\nanyway. Some colleges are not so\nstrict though. One student at Goldsmiths College who refused to pay\nhis fees was allowed back the following year, running up an increasing debt, which will have to be paid\noff before he receives his diploma\n- if he does not pay, he will not officially graduate.\nMr Butcher explained that if\nsomeone decided that they did not\nwant to pay fees, be it for political\nbeliefs or anything else, then the\nUnion would support students but\n\"not lead them blindly\". The Union\nwould make it clear to the student\nin question what the outcome of\nhis or her decision might be, and\nin most cases this would be ex pul sion. At the moment it seems that\nif a student is financially sound as\nto be able to pay their fees, then\nthe College will not allow them\nback the next year if that sum is not\npaid. However, if a student has\nthe academic potential to pass the\nyear, and come out with a degree\nat the end of the course but is\nunable to pay the fee for some\nfinancial crisis, then the College\nwould acknowledge this fact and\nact accordingly. For example, the\n8 per cent interest rate for late fees\nwould be knocked off, or in dire\nsituations the College might pay\nfor the student itself. Mr Butcher\nwarned \"students must approach\nthe College as soon as the problem appears\" and the student must\nbe able to prove their financial sit-u ation. While the issue of tuition fees\nis currently a major area of concern for students, and recent political changes have taken the first\nstep to amend the situation, there\nis little choice but to pay if a qualification is desired in the end. Yet if\nthere are genuine problems with\nthe payment of fees then the College has the ability to help out stu-dents. In contrast, if the problem is\nsimply a political opinion, then students may have to sacrifice their\ndegrees for their principles.\nas a consumer and knowhow to complain with help from the Office of Fair Trading.

    "content": "A.7 February 2000 \u00ab Felix\nToy Story 2\nWhen the original Toy Story was released in 1 995, it proved to be a landmark production, being the first feature length film animated entirely\nusing computer technology. It went on to rate third on the all time highest grossing animations list (behind Aladdin and the Lion King). Since\nthen, we've most notably had Antz and A Bug's Life, each of which\nappealed to adults and kids by following in Toy Story's unintentional foot-steps.\nSo, by telling you that Toy Story 2 is set to be one of the highest grossing\nfilms of all time, you can be rest assured this film is not just meant for kid-dies. In fact, rather boringly, I can tell you that over 60% of the audience\nin America were adults. Yes, it's about toys, and yes, it's Disney, but it's a winner for both age groups because of two simple facts. Firstly, it is visually stunning. The animation, by Pixar, is so advanced that you watch it\nlike a film, not a cartoon. It gives you a visual overdose of stunning\ngraphics. Secondly, the depth of the character is ation and storytelling is as\ngood as any real film, due to the novel script and engaging characters.\nAll the old characters are back, and the same actors as in the original Toy\nStory do all their voices. The new characters are from \"Woody's Roundup\",\na TV show in which Woody (the cowboy) starred during the 1950s. In it,\nhis sidekick was the cowgirl Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), while his\nhorse was called Bullseye. Kelsey Grammar voices the final character,\nThe Prospector, a kindly old fellow who is not all that he seems. The story\nrevolves around a malevolent toy collector, who kidnaps Woody so that\nhe can make his collection of toys from \"Woody's Roundup\" complete, in\norder to sell them to a museum for lots of money. Of course, this leaves\nBuzz Lightyear and co to go and rescue Woody, while fighting a new\nenemy, Zurg.\nWhile the story does not seem to be a million miles from the original,\nwhat does make Toy Story 2 different to its predecessor is that it is written\nwith adults in mind as well as the younger generation. However, this manifests itself in a number of excellent film takeoffs (Star Wars, Tron), and not\nreally in the dialogue. Occasionally there are jokes that are not aimed for\nyounger children, but their subtlety means that they are not derogatory to\ntheir intelligence. Indeed, it is they who get their own back by understanding some other references far better than we will.\nMost family films have a stigma attached to them in student circles -admittedly usually for good reasons. However, if there was one film that\nshould buck this trend, it is this one. If you can handle the un cool appearance of yourself going into the cinema to see it, you will be treated to one\nof the films of the year.\nDrew\nFilms\nscreen \u2022\nDouble Jeopardy\nHappily married couple Nick (Bruce Greenwood) and Libby Parsons\n(Ashley Judd) reside peacefully with child in backwoods America. During a dirty weekend on a sailboat, Libby awakes to find blood everywhere and her husband gone. When she is arrested and convicted of\nher husband's murder, Libby herself resigns to her fate and gives custody of her child to her friend Annabeth (Angela Green).\nAll seems normal, until her friend abruptly uproots and serendipity\nreveals her husband is - oh my goodness gracious - still alive. Shocked\nand bemused, Libby tries everything to remedy the situation. As her\noptions peter out and her hope fades, a conveniently convicted law\ngraduate (who just happens to be incarcerated alongside her) informs\nher of the double jeopardy clause. Under this loophole, she can execute her husband and not face the consequences, as she will have\nalready served her time in prison for the charge of murder. Duly en erg is ed she lives out her sentence by spending her time working out (cue\ncheesy Rocky scenes). Six years later, Libby is finally paroled. Travis\nLehman (Tommy Lee Jones), is a tough parole officer who won't allow\nany departure from the rules, and when Libby does try to track down\nher son, Lehman pursues her.\nAs cultured cinema goers, we enjoy fine acting, diverse plots and captivating scripts. We left the cinema not only disappointed but extremely\nempty. The acting was wooden and unconvincing from Angela Judd;\nTommy Lee Jones photocopied his character from the Fugitive and US\nMarshals. Their talents were squandered in this waste of cinema roll\nwhich should be burned.\nThe one-dimensional plot was as sterile as a radioactive panda. It\nmade sense but didn't flow. The peripheral characters were fitted\naround the plot like square bricks in a round hole. Side plots were\nbriefly glimpsed, but were quickly squashed by the juggernaut central\nplot. The script kept a constant rate of one clich e per minute that made\neverything that much more predictable, and when not in clich e mode\nthe dialogue was corny. Although this is a dull film in general, a few\nscenes stand out from the crowd, including the sinking red metro and\nthe atmospheric bloodstained awakening of Angela Judd. Don't worry\nabout these too much, however, as there should be just enough space\non the trailer to fit them all in.\nAlthough more of a chick flick we still wouldn't advise anyone to spend\ntheir time watching this \"See you on TV next Christmas\" turkey. In con-clu sion, this boring, meaningless, film shouldn't have been made. I wouldn't even bother watching it on video.\nChris and Mark\n\n"

    "content": "8 Feature Felix > 7 February 2000\nA Human Right? HAMISH COMMON When you think back to what life may\nhave been like in the thirteenth century, the idea of laws demanding trial\nby jury and a statement of rights for\ncitizens is unlikely to figure highly. Yet\none of the reasons that England sees\nitself as an ancient\nhome of liberties is\nbecause we had such a document - the\nMagna Carta - which\nstill has some legal\nforce today. Later, in\nthe mid-nineteenth\ncentury, people in England and Wales were given further\nrights to trial by jury in serious cases;\nin the time when public hanging and\nflogging were the norm.\nSuch silly rights are obviously of\nno use to us today. Jack Straw, the\nHome Secretary, is presently pushing\nto abolish the right to trial by jury for\na whole class of offences, with the\nintention of sav in a a few aer cent of\n\" the light that shows that the the criminal justice budget. He has\nbeen criticised by practically every-one, from civil liberties groups,\nlawyers, his own party, all the other\nparties and many judges. His bill was\nthrown out two weeks ago by the\nLords, with Straw saying he will reintroduce it in the Commons.\nJuries have always\nhad a way of forcing\nsome democracy on a system that is populated\nby a distant and mainly\namp of freedom public school and\nOxbridge dominated\nbums\" judiciary: there was a time once when a jury\ndeliberation room was being cleared\nout and a note from the foreman\nfound which read \"do we all agree:\n1. that this judge is a complete bas-tard; 2. that the judge wants this man\nconvicted; 3. that we therefore\nacquit?\" Juries have a common-law\nright to acquit even if the case is\napparently stacked against the\ndefendant, and this 'sympathy\nESQUIRES gloucester arcade20% oPP all espresso based beverages to all ICU students/ staff on proof of status offer valid\" until150300 next to gi out es fer rood station opposite waif f rose acquittal' or 'perverse verdict'\n(depending on your opinion) has\nbeen used to protest against silly or\noppressive laws. Some of the more\nodious Official Secrets Acts trials in\nthe seventies and early eighties,\namong others, resulted in acquittals\nwhen the defendants were legally in\nthe wrong.\nCivil servants and\npoliticians, not famous\nthe precedent may gradually\nincrease in spirit, to the utter disuse of\njuries in cases of the most momentous concern.\"\nThere is now a standard method\nto justify the removal of liberties: state\nthe incredible inconvenience the\ngovernment has to go through to\nlock someone up, crit i innocence is anc is e people who defend\nthe status quo as \"fat-for their skills at looking inconvenience that cat lawyers\"\nbeyond the balance\nsheet or next election,\noften feel that juries are\nincapable or too\nincompetent to make\ndecisions on complex matters involving criminal cases. This is not borne\nout by experience - most jurors take\ntheir duties seriously and may be\nmore likely to imagine themselves in\na street fight, domestic assault or\nrobbery than many of the magistrates\nwho would decide instead. Would\nyou prefer to be tried before twelve\npeople there to apply 'human experience' to the case or a bench of\ncase-hardened magistrates who are\nused to the high conviction rate in\ntheir courts?\nStraw now follows a well-worn\nand unpleasant path to remove these\nrights. In opposition he said the\nTories' plan to do the same (later\ndropped) was \"short-sighted and\nwrong\". Following the usual conversion ministers have when they get\ninto government, he has now seen\nthe light and ditched much of his liberalism in this regard. He follows the\nhardened Home Office view the\ninnocence is an inconvenience that\nshould be dealt with severely. He is\nalready trying to stop alleged rapists\nor their lawyers from cross-examining\ntheir accusers, and is supporting the\nremoval of the right to choose one's own lawyer. He is extending this\nargument to trial by jury, going\nagainst an ancient trend, and\nignores the opinion of the late\nrespected jurist Sir William Blackstone who said that \"delays and\ninconveniences in the forms of justice\nare the price that all free nations\nmust pay for their liberty... and that\nthese inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are fundamentally\nopposite to the spirit of our constitution and that though begun in trifles,\nshould be dealt with severely\" though criminal law\nhas never been a great\nmoney-spinner) and\nlabel others as members of the recently created new public enemy, the 'forces of\nconservatism'. Victims come in useful\nhere too as all illiberal changes in\ncriminal law can be in their interest -they have been hijacked as a blanket\njustification since people can see\nthemselves more easily as victims\nthan criminals. It is a brave person\nwho defends the unpopular, and\npoliticians know they will not win an\nelection defending criminals' rights.\nThe sad thing about this is that is\nall quite unnecessary. The cost savings will be eaten up by an appeal\nright to the crown court which has to\nbe put in because of the Human\nRights Act, meaning cases will ping-pong between courts with lawyers\ncashing in all the way. Officials, witnesses and victims will all be delayed\nas much or more than under the previous system. Analogies to the Scottish system (where the right to trial by\njury is curbed) are inappropriate\nsince there the 'sheriffs' have much\nless power anyway.\nWe ought to feel reasonably\nproud of the fact that we cannot be\nlocked up in this country for more\nthan a year without twelve ordinary\npeople agreeing to it. It is frankly\nscary that our guilt of serious\noffences may soon be decided by\nexperts and imposed on us, with trial\nby jury reserved for the famous or\npeople with 'a reputation to defend'\n(in this proposal your rights to trial by\njury will be genuinely decided by how\nimportant you look). Since only people with such reputations are given\nthe right to trial by jury, the proposal\nis itself admitting it may be unfair. If\nsome of us deserve freedoms, we all\ndo.\n\n"

For my money, it's undoubtedly the latter - and\nas such it's something to be applauded, not\ncastigated.\nantisocial tendencies Screen violence, however, is a completely different matter. To use the same argument would\nbe to say that we've become readier to accept\nviolence as an integral part of society. Yet this is\nsurely contrary to the essence of our beliefs\nabout the development of civilisation. Surely\nthe idea is that we've developed past the need\nfor brutality and pain when it comes to deciding who's best? Then, pray tell, why did millions\nof people around the world pay through the\nnose to see a convicted rapist beat the hell out\nof some British guy they'd never heard of\nbefore last week?\nThis is where the two strings draw together.\nIgnore other issues (brief nudity and a little\nswearing never hurt anyone anyway) and\nrealise that we're living in a society that is not\nonly increasingly violent, but which revels in\nthat fact. The reasons for this change are com-plex. Unlike generations before us, we don't live in the shadow of war - sure, wars still break\nout all over the planet, but the likelihood of\nsomeone invading Britain or any armed conflict\nescalating to the scale where the government\nwould have to reintroduce conscription is now\npractically zilch. Meanwhile, our access to the\nimagery of war and suffering has grown to an\nunprecedented level. Turn on the news or open\nyour newspaper on any day of the week, and\nyou're guaranteed to find images of emaciated\nvictims and bloodthirsty guerrilla forces staring\nback at you. Simultaneously, you'll hear ream\nafter ream of figures spl ur ted out from watch-dogs, governments and research groups,\ntelling you that the death toll from this conflict\nwas x thousand, or the figures for violent crime\nhave gone up by y percent. (Disturbingly, government press releases dealing with crime statistics usually state that car crime and burglary\nare decreasing, whilst violent crime and sexual\nassault are on the increase).\nSo, is this the answer? Does sensory overload blunt our responses and lead us to\nassume that violence is inescapable? Surely not\n- after all, time and again history has seen the\nmost protracted and bloody wars used as a catalyst to promote the creation of a new, idyllic\nvision of the future. A classic example came in\nthe aftermath of the First World War: so\nshocked and trauma tis ed were the leaders of\nall the nations involved, they vowed never to go\nto war again.\nThe difference, however, is that we have\nhad no experience of that kind of traumatic\nexposure to the horrific side of organised vio-len ce. As far as we're concerned, life is what we\nsee at the movies and on the TV, and whilst, for\nsome of us, that might mean we're living in a Dawson's Creek dreamland, for others it means\na planet where combat only exists as a form of\nentertainment (you'd be scared by the ratings\nthat the WWF gets in both Britain and the US)\nor sport (anyone ever watched Ultimte Fighting?). That's not to say that on-screen violence\nencourages us to maim and kill our neighbours\n(although I'm still not sure that the sight of\nMacaulay Culkin happily blasting flamethrowers at his enemies - who then suffer nothing\nmore than singed eyebrows - is a positive\nimage for kids); rather it suggests that violence\nhas become less of a last resort. Crime related\nmurder and assault continues to climb; bullying\nis on the increase; our government feels happy\nto level downtown Baghdad at the first sign of\ntruculence. All three are related by the fact that,\nbecause we've never personally been forced to\nexperience death up close and personal, we\nstoop to the unpleasant solution far more read-i ly. Sure we see death everyday on the news, in\nevery episode of Casualty or ER, and in every\nnew summer blockbuster - but it's as an it is ed vision of death, filtered and censored so that it\ndoesn't offend our middle-class sensibilities. It\ndoesn't scare or horrify us.
