    "content": "Featura FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 11\nr 'own& oD own & Out is yet again looking\nforward to forthcoming events\naround London. There are many\nevents taking place in the next\nseven days and D&O takes a quick\nlook at the best of them. These\naren't necessarily the most\nexpensive and some of them are\nfree. Like, er, on Saturday 4th: sold on the door for Monday 6th. Manchester's leading Indie band (since the\nSmiths signing to EMI) never seems to break\nthrough into the main stream proper. They\nhave kept up a low live profile this year but\nreturn with the new term and this gig is not\nworth missing.\nIX he Men They Couldn't Hang are playing at a FREE Anti-Fascist Rally on Cable Street, El at 5pm. Though not on a par with the Pogues\nin terms of record sales, they easily match\n\u2022 them live, with there version of Rawhide\nI needing to be heard to be believed.\n1 here are some very good bands playing this\nweek who don't charge the earth, such as The\nHank Wangford Band, a gy nea o logi st with one\nhell of a stage act, performing at the Half\nMoon, E15 for just \u00a33 on Saturday 4.\nO,'n Sunday 5, at the Marquee, plays The\nLarks, (who are incidentally playing in College\non October 23 thanks to Uncle Dan, the Ents\nman), it costs just \u00a33.50, they have a few things\nto say about the world and when I saw them\neveryone had a really good time. Honest John!\n1 here are still a few hundred \u00a35 tickets left\nfor New Order concert at the Albert Hall to be\nmustn't forget my favorite group of the\nmoment, the Housemartins, who are playing at\nmy favorite venue of the moment, The\nNational Club, on Kilburn High Road, NW6.\nAlso soon to be appearing there are the Smiths\nand Billy Bragg. Er, back to the\nHotosemartins, sorry. Easily the fourth best\nband (in Hull) with an absolute monster\nalbum behind them, deservedly I say. I thought their album, London 0 Hull 4, was not\noverly publicised by Go! Discs, but didn't appear to matter as it charted on its own\nstrength. The highly original video to their\nsingle, Happy Hour, certainly helped them\nbreak through to the Top Ten and\nwider public recognition, but they\ndeserved it. Since they came up\nthrough the clubs, and weren'ta product of a record company's imagination, they know how to\nentertain their audience, and create\na superb atmosphere when playing\nlive. Well worth going north on the\nJubilee Line next Thursday\n(October 9th) at only \u00a34 (\u00a33 cones).\nLega events to look forward to over the\ncoming month include Everything But The Girl\nat the Royal Albert Hall on the 14th. ZZ Top at\nWembley Arena for 4 nights from the 20th. The Smiths are at the National Club on the\n23rd, the Brixton Academy on the 24th and the\nPalladium on the 26th. Ifyou really want to see\nThe Smiths, buy your ticket quickly as they're\nnearly sold out on all three dates. The\nStranglers are at Wembley Arena on 3rd November. For a mere \u00a37 or \u00a38, it could be\nsomething to tell your children in years to\ncome as they never cease to excel when playing\nlive and should be well worth the visit.\nwent to see then when they first came out such\nas A Private Function, Brazil, and * with a Stranger. Much as it might see i: a ze of\nconcrete, Cinema One in the Barbican is quite\neasy to find as long as you don't take the short\ncut down the corridor to your right, up the\nsteps and along the walkway because you\nusually end up where you started, or more\nlikely, somewhere you've never been before.\nStudents can get in for \u00a32 and you can always\nfind something entertaining to watch there, if\nonly lots of people lost, looking worried and\nwishing they could remember how to get out.\nIP or the Arty Farty ones among you, and\nthere is no reason why you should exclude\nyourself from that description, there is an\nexhibition over the road at the Royal College of\nArt, who also serve very nice food by the way,\nshowing the role of post-war design, paying\npart icu al ry attention to a exhibition held at the\nV&A40 years ago to encourage high\nstandards of design. If you feel more energetic\nand can get further than Kensington Gore,\nyou could make tracks over to Trafalger\nSquare and visit the National Gallery for\nFREE. They're showing (until November 23)\n140 paintings, drawings and prints of the early\nyears of Dutch landscape called Dutch\nLandscape: the Early Y^ ars sr pri gly. You\nmight not think this is your < is ut, how\ncan you tell till you get over there and see it\nyourself, all it takes is some of j jur time.\nIf you fancy going down the South Bank\nbefore Sunday, ie Saturday, there is the last\nnight of the National Theatres excellent\nproduction of Animal Farm but never fear if\nyou can't make it, it will return after its World\nTour. But taking its place is Pravda, the\nfunniest play in town, so don't feel any reason\nnot to boogie on down there, ie near Waterloo\nTube station, or somewhere in that\napproximate vicinity.\nYou might of noticed that I didn't ment on the Hawkwind Autumn Tour at all, unlike\nsome. I just thought I'd point that out.\nGood burrowing\nThe Mole\no 'ver at the Barbican, they're showing_ what I consider some of the\nwackiest films in recent\ntimes, and well worth seeing\nagain, or for the first\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 2\nLife\nIn A Northern\nTown\nDear Sir,\nAs an ex-student and Station\nManager of IC Radio for two years\n(between 1981 and 1983) I like to\nkeep moderately 'in touch' with\nwhat is going on at this College.\nIt was with some dismay, not to\nsay anger, that I heard on IC Radio\na news report containing an extract\nfrom the 'Welcoming' address to\nfirst-year students given by the\nRector, Professor Ash.\nIn this speech, after stressing\n(quite rightly) the opportunities\navailable to students at IC to visit a number of interesting museums in\nthe vicinity, he summed by by\nasking them 'not to find themselves in some God-forsaken factory in the\nNorth of England somewhere' (his\nbad syntax, not mine) wishing they\nhad taken advantage of the virtues\nof the South which he had just\nex to led. This is indeed a welcome for\nstudents from the Northern\ncounties! As a Yorkshireman I remember about halfway through\nmy first Spring term feeling\nsomewhat disenchanted with the\nattitude of several Southerners I had\nmet. If Professor Ash had been the\nRector at that time I would certainly\nhave felt that I had made a mistake\nin coming here. Now, with my five-figure salary and my comfortable\nlifestyle in London (while many\nacademically able friends are\nstanding in dole queues two\nhundred miles away) I should\nperhaps be grateful for the naivety\nof my youth.\nPerhaps not. After all it cannot be\neasy to live in some God-forsaken\nmansion in SW7 without ever\nhaving visited (or even recognised\nthe existence of) the National\nRailway Museum in York, the\nNational Museum of Film, Theatre\nand Television in Bradford,\nSteamtown at Carnforth, seen the\nLake District or the Bronte\nParsonage at Howarth or heard the\n\u2022Halle Orchestra or English National\nOpera North or even the Black\nDyke Mills Brass Band!\nBut enough of my hopefully\nforgivable Northern indignation. As\na graduate of City and Guilds\nCollege, which I trust still guards\njealously its reputation as the finest\nengineering college in Britain, I find\nthe Rector's remarks equally\ninfuriating if the target of the\nadjective 'God-forsaken' was the\nfactory rather than the North. The\nidea that industry is a career to be\nlooked down upon is one that many\neminent people outside as well as\ninside the engineering profession\n(the Prince of Wales is one person\nwho springs to mind) have been\ntrying to eradicate for many years.\nHad such remarks as those I refer to\ncome from the Chancellor of\nOxford University (which I doubt\nthat they would) then we engineers\nand scientists would no doubt\nspring to the conclusion that he was\nout of touch with the modern world.\nThat they should come from the\nRector of the Imperial College of\nScience and Technology is\nastounding!\nIf Professor Ash had urged his\nnew students not to end up doing\nvoluntary Service Overseas in some\nThird World hell-hole there would\nno doubt have been an outcry (at\nleast I would hope so). I hope he\nrealises that to make this sort of\nremark is just as offensive.\nYours Faithfully,\nNeil Sykes B. Sc. (Eng) A. C.G.I Entry\nRules\nAttacked\nDear Dave,\nI'd like to thank Beit security staff\nfor their help at the New Year's Party on Monday. I believe there\nhave been complaints about the\nunion card check system operating\nat Beit Arch, perhaps I'd better\nexplain.\nThe Union has only just been\ngranted its own licence for the\npremises. This is not a full\nperformance licence; our chances of\ngetting one of those are less than\nzero, as the local residents are\nunhappy enough about us running\ntwo or three major events like this\neach year.\nIt is inevitable, on an occasion\nlike Monday, that someone will\ncomplain to the police about the\nnoise level in the area. It is a 'lso likely\nthat, since our licence.is new, we are\nbeing WATCHED anyway. There\nis no way we can afford not to\ncomply with the licencing\nregulations; hence the card check.\nImperial College Union has a reciprocal agreement with virtually\nevery local college. All the students\nfrom those colleges needed to do\nwas to show their own union cards\nto be let in. OK, so there was a bit of\na queue-better than the alternative,\na court injunction stopping us from\nholding anymore parties of this sort.\nYours,\nChristine Taig\nCollege Accommodation\nCollege administration have\nassured us that the former Hong\nKong students centre was\nunsuitable as a new hall for\nImperial. When FELIX contacted\nCollege's Assistant Secretary,\nMichael Arthur, we were told that\nthe report drafted on the possibility\nof the scheme was classified as\n'confidential'. It is difficult to see\nwhy, if the administration is\ngenuinely enthusiastic about\nexpanding IC's student accommodation, the report on a possible\nnew hall should be restricted. Mr\nArthur says that 'it was decided' not\nto pursue a policy of searching for\nand redeveloping existing\nproperties unless they were\nemin ant ly suitable. In the light of\nthe rush, for Hall places in which\n200 students are likely to loose out,\nIC Union should demand to see a comprehensive report on the\nviability study carried out on the\nbuildings. I am far from convinced\nthat the project was looked at in any\ndetail.\nFELIX\nOver the past few weeks FELIX\nhas been produced because many of\nthe regular staff are prepared to go\nwithout any sleep. They would like\nme to point out that if more people\ncome and work on FELIX they may\nable to get to bed before 6.00am. If\nyou are even remotely interested in\nworking for this amazing rag,\nplease turn up to the staff meeting\nat 12.30pm today in the FELIX\noffice (Beit Arch).\nCredits\nThanks once more to Judith\nHackney, Chris Edwards & Mark\nCottle, Mole, Ch's Martin.

    "content": "News Friday October 3 1986 1 2\nPie In The Eye For Welfare Advisor\nLesley Gillingham, the Student\nWelfare Advisor, was flan ned during the Undergraduates'\nReception on Monday when five\nraiders dressed in Guilds Hit Squad\nlivery stormed the stage. Four\nmembers of the IC Union Executive\nwere also flan ned. The Guilds office\nlater refused a request by Rag\nChairman Man Tai Tseung for a 'hit' on the Post-graduate Freshers'\nReception.\nMiss Gillingham is understood to\nhave been quite upset by the\nincident which took place despite\nthe Union Executive's endeavours\nto present 'a mature image' at the\nreception. She is particularly\nconcerned that the raiders did not\nask her permission for the 'hit'\u2014 a customary service when members of\nstaff are to be the target.\nUnion President Christine Taig,\nwho described the attack as\n'childish' and 'irresponsible', said\nthat further steps would be taken\nshould the Hit Squad step out of line\nagain.\nStarwars Journal\nFollowing the passing of a motion\ncondemning the Starwars program\nat its annual delegate conference on\nthe 13th of May, the Association of\nScientific Technical and Managerial\nStaff (ASTMS) has began moves to\nwiden the Star Wars issue.\nA special Starwars edition of the\nASTMS Journal which has a circulation of 400,000 will explain\nsome of the problems and fears\nsurrounding the star wars programme.\nThe Supplement is being collated\nby John Fecamp the ASTMS\nrepresentative at Imperial College\nfrom information supplied by the\nPeace Groups, FELIX and other\nsources. 'We need to convince\npeople that Starwars is morally\nwrong', explained Mr Fecamp, who\nis anxious that ASTMS members\nshould not be forced to work on\nStarwars without being given the\noption of alternative work\nClive Jenkins, Chairman of\nASTMS is adam ent ly opposed to\nSDI, which he described to FELIX\n'As an absurd immoral concept\nwhich will either kill us all or else\nwill bleed our resources'.\nForced\nResignation\nAn engineering student was\npersuaded to resign his sponsorship\nwith Royal Ordnance pic at the end\nof last term, after writing an article\ncondemning arms manufacture for\nthe Christian Magazine Chi Rho.\nIt is unclear how the company\nobtained a copy of the article from\nthe magazine, which has a circulation of five hundred. A spokesman from the student's department told FELIX that\ninformation on students' extra\ncurricular activities is not passed\nback to sponsoring companies. The\nstudent concerned declined to\ncomment on the incident.\nRCS Hon Sec\nResigns\nThe RCS Hon Sec, Mark Mockett,\nhas resigned his position in order to\nconcentrate on his studies. Mr\nMockett, who failed his first-year\nexams because of illness and was\nunable to take res its, will now have\nto take two sets of exams at the end\nof the second year.\nFELIX asked Physics Senior\nTutor Dr Engel whether pressure\nfrom the department had been\nplaced on Mr Mockett to resign. Dr\nEngel pointed out that Mr\nMockett's entry into the second year\nwas not conditional on his\nresignation.\nSDI Book Withdrawn\nA book written by former DOC\nResearch Manager Richard Ennals\nhas been inexplicably taken off the\npresses by its publisher John Wiley.\nThe book 'A Question of\nInitiative', is critical of the\nAmerican Starwars programme and\nexpresses the view that SDI will\nprove harmful to research in British\nUniversities.\nThe publishers, part of an\nAmerican group, have declined to\nsay why the book has been\nwithdrawn.\nMr Ennals resigned his IC post\nlast January in protest against SDI.\nHe told FELIX that the book\ncontains no information that hasn't already been published, and\nspeculates that outside pressure may\nhave been placed on the company.\nHe will be holding discussions with\nthe publishers in the next couple of\ndays. Mr Tam Dalyell MP will raise\nthe matter in the House of\nCommons.\nNew Kitchens\nThe new Kitchens installed in\nFalmouth Keogh Hall have been\nfavourably received. Peter\nHallworth, Managing Surveyor,\nsays he feels that the staircase\nkitchens are 'the best solution' to the\nproblem of providing amenities. An\nimportant reason for the change was\nto provide a proper place for the\nfridge-freezers and refuse bins that\nused to be on each landing,\nconflicting, with the fire regulations. Residents now have one smaller\nkitchen between twenty-six people\nrather than a large one between\nseventy-two.\nWhether the same scheme will be\nfollowed in Tizard and Selkirk is not\nyet resolved. Student opinion will be\nsought and the matter will have to\ngo through the Hall Committees,\nsaid Peter Hallworth.\nRhino Rescue\nThe first assignment for Dr Iain\nThornton, now Chairman of the IC\nCentre for Environmental\nTechnology, will be a Rhino Rescue\nproject at the Lake Nakuru\nNational Park in Kenya. Dr\nThornton, an environmental\ngeo chemist, will collect samples of\nsoil, water, and vegetation eaten by\nthe Black Rhinoceros in the hope of\nfinding the reason for the high\nincidence of the cobalt deficiency\nwhich is afflicting the Rhino\npopulation in the area.\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews.\ny f Films ^fC\nAnother film in which music plays\nan important part is Good to Go\nwhich unlike some of its\npredecessors actually has a reasonable narrative\nSet in Washington, a group of\nlocal lads are trying hard to get\nsome recognition for their Go Go\nmusic (heavy funk) but they are\nconstantly hindered by the activities\nof a few rowdy Angel Dust takers\nand a racist policeman. Detective\nHarrigan is a man who falsifies\npolice press statements to implicate\nthe club in which the band plays and\ntries to damage the black\ncommunity. Into the area comes\naging Art Garfunkel desperate for a good story to rescue his career.\nWhen he discovers the truth about\nthe area, he is prevented from\npublishing and chased by Harrigan.\nThe film is fairly well made with\nexcellent acting from all except\nperhaps a few of the musicians but it\ndoes show a tendency for\ngra tui tio us slow motion and a fascination for feet, though perhaps\nin a movie about such foot tapping\nmusic this is not without reason.\nThe soundtrack, and not just the\nmusic, is very well used and there is\na neat plot device at the end to\ncurtail any sentimental heroism in\nGarfunkePs revelations. Thefilmis\na powerful insight into the black\nAmerican community where one in\ntwo lives in poverty, one in two\nteenagers is out of work and where\nhomicide is the leading cause of\nmale deaths, it's just a pity that this\nparticular fictional community's saviour was white.\n'There are no points for 2nd place'\nand 'though we are not at war, we\nmust act as though we are', thus the\ninstructor sums up the philosophy\nof the US Navy's fighter weapons school, known as Top Gun.\nWhen some Americans looked at\nthe statistics for kill ratios in the\nmost recent conflicts they\ndiscovered that in the Korean and\n2nd World War the US were\nshooting down 15 enemy planes to\nevery one American, in Vietnam\nthis was down to about 5:1. Having\ndecided that the reason for this was\nthe modern pilots reliance on\nmissiles rather then dog fighting\nskills the fighter weapons school\nwas set up to correct this. Top Gun\nis a film based around that school,\nand when I tell you that the film is\nwhole-hearted ly endorsed by the\nPentagon you'll probably realise\nthat it won't be by this liberal\nreviewer.\nTom Cruise (Risky Business,\nLegend) plays an unorthodox flyer,\nMaverick, who gains a place at the\nschool where he is arrogantly\ndetermined to be the best. He is\nassisted in this quest by his\nnavigator, Goose (Anthony\nEdwards) and he is hindered by his\nopponent Iceman (Val Kilmer) the\nantithesis of Maverick and his'\nnavigator, Slider (yes, I'm sorry they\nall have silly names it's all part of the\n'whoop-whoop, alright, yeah, yo l' mentality required for the American\nmilitary). The love interest is\nprovided by Kelly McGillis\n(Witness) as an astrophysicist. Her\nfirst official introduction is via a shot\nof her black-stocking ed legs in a tight skirt, such is the role of women\nin the film. In fact the first\nappearance of a woman in the film is a pair of legs in a bar and even Ms\nMcGillis' character, Charlie, is not\nsaved from the r61e of supportive\npartner by her status or\nqualification; the well being of the\npilots is all that matters.\nIt is interesting that all the combat\nsituations shown at the school show\nthe Americans as the aggressors,\nbut when it comes to reality, the\nfinal crisis situation sequence at the\nend, the E. European block was\nshown to be at fault. Once again\nunfortunately the Eastern block is\nportrayed as an evil aggressor\nbehind dark visors.\nApart from in my view, its highly\nsuspect ideology, the film does have\nsome stunning photography,\ncourtesy of Jeffrey Kimbal, and this\nis wholly in keeping with director\nTony Scott's strong visual sense.\nThe action sequences are very\nimpressive, with a couple of sloppily\nedited exceptions. The love scenes\nare awkwardly handled and are not\nhelped by unsuitable music. Most of\nthe film has a driving rock score that\nis entirely appropriate for the\nmacho activities portrayed.\nNevertheless it's a well made and\nentertaining film, I even began to\nquite like Maverick, the arrogant\nlittle jerk, in spite of myself, it's just a pity they have to be quite so jubilant about killing people.\nREVIEWS About last Night is a film based on David Mamet's play Sexual\nPerversity in Chicago but\nobviously the producers weren't going to release a film with that\nname and along with the title has\ngone some of Mamet's incisive\ncomment on American society,\nthough not all of his sharp, realistic\ndialogue.\nRob Lowe and Demi Moore star\nas two in dependants who do not\nnormally go in for stable\nrelationships and find out what\nhappens when love takes over. It's a fairly san it is ed film with none of\nMamet's disturbing revelations but\nwith the great redeeming feature of\nJim Belushi, who has all his brother\nJohn's capacity for degeneracy but\na far greater acting ability.\n-Theatre-This new comedy deals with the\nlife of Franz Kafka in the finite detail the man utilised to question his own\nworld.\nIn a variety of settings and\ntheatrical styles, Kafka's Dick\nfollows the evolve ment of this great\n20th century writer; and examines\nhis relationship with fame,\nimmortality and oppression. Had\nMax Brod, Kafka's oldest and\nclosest companion obeyed his\nfriend's dying wish, there would\nhave been no Kafka. Brod had\npromised to burn all Kafka's writings.\nThe opening scene (1920's) combines the paranoid melodramatic Kafka with the 'Jewish\nNew York' humour of Brod. This\nsetting is only by means of an\nintroduction, for as Kafka talks of\nhis dreams of the future, the scene\nrapidly changes and the action\nmoves to the present day living\nroom of the typically middle-class\nwhite household of Linda, a housewife, and Sydney, an\ninsurance broker, conveniently\nobsessed by Kafka. The normality\nof this situation is shattered and\ndevastated by a series of strange\nhappenings. It is not usual for Max\nBrod, who is dead, to arrive at the\nfront door carrying a wet tortoise\nthat metamorphoses into Franz\nKafka. The possibilities this raises\nare endless, but Bennett wisely\nchooses to explore Kafka'\nBooks\nIf you like travel books you H love it,\nif you don't you won't, but\nunfortunately I don't think that\nKevin and I in India is likely to be a bestseller. Were it written by Clive\nJames or Daphnie Du Maurier\nmaybe; however this collection of\nanecdotes, though amusing,\ndoesn't really hang together. Frank\nKusy's book does have a wealth of\nfascinating details, like the hotel\nmassage men, sunrise over the\nGanges or the illegal demolition\nteams that knock down buildings in\nthe middle of the night to avoid\npolice detection, but it is all very\nmuch from a Western view. It would\nbe useful for anyone contemplating\nvisiting India, as it gives descriptions\nnot only of all the shrines, temples\nand tourist spots you might come\nacross, but also all the tricks and\ndodges that the con-men use.\nCosting \u00a34.95 it is published by\nImpact books.\nIf its cheap or free books you're\nafter, don't forget the Oxfam shop\non Ken High St, plus the Gloucester\nRoad Bookshop, a brilliant second\nhand shop just South of (you've\nguessed) Gloucester Road Tube\nStation. Finally, while hunting for a housing benefit form I bumped into\nan excellent library on Hornton\nRoad-just off Ken High St by the\nMacdonalds.\ndisillusionment when he discovers\nthat Brod has not burnt his work,\nand that he is in fact, highly\nacclaimed and famous. The\nappearence of Kafka's evil father,\nHermann and his impotent mother\npress the underlying issue of\nKafka's paradoxical desire for\nimmortality and oblivion still\nfurther. Finally, an amazing set\nchange accompanied by much dry\nice finds all the characters in\nheaven, but this is still only part of\nKafka's dream-like delve into the\nfuture, and he concludes... 'Heaven\nis going to be hell' as he drifts back\nto the 1920's. Kafka's Dick is at times very\nfunny,and Alan Bennett has found a true bale n ce between various styles\nof humour and a far deeper\nintention.\n100\nThe\nYears Of\nPhoenix\nThis year marks an important\ncentenary in the history of\nImperial College. In December\nthe Phoenix, the annual literary\nmagazine at IC, will be 100\nyears old.\nThe Phoenix was founded in\nDecember 1886 by the science\nfiction novelist H.G. Wells, one\nof the College's most illustrious\ngraduates. Since then it has\nseen a string of talented, and\nsometimes notorious, editors.\nIn 1942, the editor was one G. Wilkinson, now Professor Sir\nGeoffrey Wilkinson, FRS, head\nof the Chemistry Department.\nPatient research has shown\nthat he is the only Phoenix\neditor to receive a Nobel Prize\n(so far).\nIn the 1950s David Irving\nbecame editor. He left the\ncollege under a cloud, and\ncame to prominence recently\nas a neo-Fascist historian, in\nthe Hitler Diary controversy.\nMore recently, editors have\nincluded the novelist S.J. Marshall, who also edited\nFELIX (1980-81). Marshall\nbrought a new level of\nprofessionalism to the Phoenix,\nand set the standard for\nsubsequent issues.\nUnlike FELIX, the Phoenix\nhas seen its share of women\nentire, the latest being Diane\nLove, who was a PhD student\nin the physics department until\nrecently.\nThe magazine has published\ncontributions from staff at the\ncollege, as well as students.\nCollege security officer\nGeoffrey Reeves has become\nwell known for his\ncontributions in comic verse,\nand Dr Bernard Lamb, of the\nlife sciences division, for his\nhumorous, and sometimes\nsatirical, prose.\nThis year the editor is Chris\nEdwards, Chemistry 3. Chris\nsays that there is just time for\nstudents to send in\ncontributions to the FELIX\noffice: short stories, poems,\nphotographs and essays\u2014all\nare still required.\nThe Phoenix will go on sale\nin November, and Phoenix\nCentenary Week will be from\n24 to 28 November.\nThe action-packed week will\ninclude: on Monday 24\nNovember, a special Wellsoc\nlecture; on Tuesday, a lecture\nin collaboration with the\ndepartment of humanities; on\nWednesday at lunchtime, a careers seminar for students\ninterested in pursuing a career\nin writing; on Thursday, a launch party for the Centenary\nedition of Phoenix; and on\nFriday, a Grand Buffet Dinner\nin 170 Queensgate, the\nRector's official residence.\nMore details will appear in\nFELIX in coming weeks.\nDavid Rowe\n\n"

    "content": "Feature, FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 5\nForeign Fields by Don Adlington\nOf British universities only Oxford,\nCambridge and Imperial College\nhave established formal arrange\nment s for considering student\nexpedition proposals and providing\npractical support, invariably\naccompanied, for those proposals\nreceiving approval, by a grant.\nThe Exploration Board is a College committee comprising\nacademic staff, representatives of\nthe Old Students Association, and\nfive students. It has a chairman,\ntreasurer and secretary appointed\nby the Rector, and an equipment\nofficer who looks after the Board's store and issues equipment on loan\nto expeditions. The regular income\ncomes from the College, from the\nImperial College Union and for the\npast three years we have also had\nmost welcome financial support\nfrom the National Westminster\nBank.\nSince 1955, the College, through\nits Exploration Board, has\nsupported 112 expeditions,\ninvolving many hundreds of\nstudents. Imperial College\nexpeditions have travelled to\nvirtually every corner of the world.\nThey have climbed high mountains;\nexplored deep caves; traversed\ndeserts and art ic regions; worked in\nequatorial forests and on remote\nislands. They have used virtually\nevery means of transport including\nsledge, ski, mule and canoe. All\nthese students have come home\nfeeling that they have accomplished\nsomething of lasting value in terms\nof their personal development, and\nwhich for many of them could only\nhave happened in the context of a properly organised expedition.\nWhat kinds of things do student\nexpeditions do? Expeditions\napproved by the Board in 1985 and\n1986 may give some idea (though\nyou would in fact have to look over a number of years to get a proper\nview of the range of possibilities):\n1 a group of geology students\ntravelled to the Baltistan region of\nthe Karakorum in North East\nPakistan with the primary aim of\nmaking a large scale geological map\nof a particularly interesting area in\nthe continental coll is on zone.\n2 two final year chemical\nengineers, joined by two colleagues\nfrom Kings College, carried out an\nentomological project and an\necological study of an extensive\nregion of the Western Sahara.\n3 seven members of the\nMountaineering Club travelled to\nEast Africa to climb in Kenya and\nTanzania.\n4 three students from the Mineral\nEngineering Department undertook an extensive Landrover\njourney through large tracts of\nAfrica, visiting many gold and\ndiamond mines, with a view to\nstudying location differences in\nmining across the continent.\n5 five second year biologists\ncarried out a six week scientific\nprogramme working from the Royal\nSociety's Field Studies Centre in\nBorneo.\n6 eight members of the IC Caving\nClub spent two months caving at\nhigh altitude in the Rocky\nMountains.\nThere is, of course, no reason at\nall why students should not go off\nand do exciting things in other\ncountries entirely without reference\nto the college, and very many do so.\nIf the intention is to have an\nexpedition, however, as opposed to\nan adventurous holiday, there are\nwe believe some enormous\nadvantages in using the Exploration\nBoard. In the first place expeditions\ngaining the Board's formal\nrecognition have the status of\nofficial College ventures and may\nuse the College's name and\nconsiderable reputation in this field\nin their approaches to other\norganisations for financial and other\nhelp. They will have easy access not\nonly to the body of expertise\navailable in the College, but also\neminent authorities in a wide variety\nof settings outside the College. The\nBoard's approval almost invariably\ncarries with it a monetary grant, and\nmost expeditions borrow\nequipment from our stock, which\nwould otherwise have to be bought\nby the members themselves. The\nBoard also ensures excellent\ninsurance cover at no cost to the\nstudents themselves.\nThe disadvantage\u2014if such it\nbe\u2014of seeking the Exploration\nBoard's su port is that there is a certain degree of formality involved.\nExpeditions are expected to submit\ncoherent proposals with well\ndefined objectives and, on return, a comprehensive report. The Board's treasurer maintains a degree of\ncontrol over expeditions' financial\naccounts and over insurance\narrangements.\nIf you have the germ of an idea\n(and that's all you need to begin\nwith) for an expedition in 1987, we\nwould be very glad to discuss it with\nyou at an early stage.

Handbooks arrive bulging\nwith inserts promising free clocks,\nmoney, overdrafts and credit cards,\nand the Sunday supplements\nmiraculously sprout full colour\ntwo-page ads extolling the virtues\nof bank accounts.\nHowever, despite all the glowing\npromises, the glossy booklets and\nprose borrowed from washing\npowder adverts, the offers they\nmake bear remarkable similarities,\neven if the philosophies differ.\nThe incentives tend to remain\naround the area of \u00a310 in your\naccount when it's opened, a \u00a3200\nguaranteed overdraft, no bank\ncharges and the ubiquitous cheque\nand auto bank cards. NatWest\ncurrently leads the field with 34%\nof the market with this sort of\ncombination along with their\nproud boast of having the largest\nnumber of branches on campus as\nwell as auto banks. Midland, once the furthest\nbehind with a lacklustre package\nand little publicity, have managed\nto pull into second place by\noffering choices of cassette tapes,\nquartz clocks and money backed\nup with a National Express Coach\ndiscount card and cheaper\ntraveller's cheques. However\nLloyds used to suffer from an\nover-gimmicky presentation with\ncompetitions and cheap\nsubscriptions to New Scientist, but\nvery little in the way of solid help or\ntangible gifts. However they have\nnow fallen into line with the\nNatWest system, offering \u00a3 10 in the\nnew account and a \u00a3200 guaranteed\noverdraft.\n\"Bad boys\" of the student\nmarket, Barclays have un sur pris ingly fallen back to 4th place with a market share of 1\n8\n% following an\nactive boycotting campaign by\nunions around the country. Who\nwants to be a victim of the new\napartheid for Barclaycard users?\nThey have also suffered from a no-nonsense campaign spurning free\ngifts, concentrating on their\nservices, which are also just like the\nNatWest system. But in an attempt\nto revive their flagging\nperformance they have tried a late\nentry with a cheap / ILO FAX Clone.\nOperating without the stigma\nattached to their big brother in the\nVISA syndicate, the Royal Bank of\nScotland and the Co-operative\nBank have stepped up their own\npackage of incentives to capital is e on the advantages of giving away\ncredit cards with nowhere to use\nthem. The Bank of Scotland has\nopted for the Nat West formula,\nbut the Co-operative Bank, riding\non its policy of lower bank charges\nhas come up with a different\napproach to the traditional\ndiscipline of a regular monthly\nstatement.\"\nT Co-op would prefer to\n\"educate\" students into using\ncredit cards as much as possible.\nHowever, a quick glance at the\ninterest rates and the surcharges on\nVISA cash advances (currently\nabout 1.5%) compared with the\nstandard overdraft rate for\nstudents, even on large overdrafts,\nreveals that the credit card is an\nexpensive way of borrowing\nmoney, which even the Co-op's promises about lower bank charges\ncannot hide. Credit cards have a monthly interest rate of 2%, which\nadds up to26.8% over a year, while\noverdrafts rates tend to hover\naround the 11% mark per annum.\nThink about it.\nThe fact that all of the banks are\nprepared to offer these incentives,\nand in many cases bend over\nbackwards to give students large\noverdrafts (at least up to the \u00a31000\nmark), is an indication of how\nmuch they prize having those\naccounts. Students of today tend to\nbecome the executives of tomorrow\nwith charge cards and five figure salaries \u2014 all useful capital for the\nbanks to draw on. They also tend to\ntake out bigger loans from those\nsame banks. People tend to be\nloath to change bank accounts, and\nit is often difficult once you begin\nto become overdrawn to any\nextent. The net result is that once a bank has a customer, that customer\nCREATIVE\nBANKING\nAmong the things in life that one can\nalways rely on, along with the ph on ringing while you are in the bath, and\nthe good ones always being taken,\nthe truism that banks, and bank\nmanagers are there only to help\nthemselves, and if in the process the\nhappen to help you, then so be it, but\nthis is not their primary aim. With\nthis firmly in mind I invented the\nconcept of creative banking.\nCreative banking is the process of\nmutual use, and abuse, where the\nbalance between bank and custom e is redressed. IfI seem a little call ou in my analysis of the situation, then\nbear in mind that with over two\nhundred thousand students at\nuniversities and polytechnics in this\ncountry, the banks handle nearly two\nhundred million pounds of studen\nmoney, and the interest they make\nfrom that.\nWhat is more, creative banking\ncan be fun. Really. Speaking as one\nwith a wardrobe full of free alarm\nclocks, statement holders, and\npseudo-leather cheque-book\nholders, I can vouch for this. The\nbasis of this Creative Banking is to\nopen as many bank accounts as\npossible, and credit card accounts as\nwell, and play bank against bank\nThe inti al advantages are obvious; as\nmany free gifts as you can manage,\nor up to fifty pounds in sweeties paid directly into your account. As you\nnow no longer need an LEA Grant\ncheque to open an account, being a customer of all seven banks is a possibility. Also, between seven\nhundred and a thousand pounds of\noverdraft facility will come in handy\nfor budding entrepreneurs\neverywhere for buying those TSB\nshares. And if a bank gets upset\nabout your use of its overdraft\nBy\nPeter Wilson\n\u00abas many free gifts as\nyou can manage\u00bb\nMidland have stopped offering the\nguaranteed overdraft of a couple of\nhundred, prefer ing to arrange\noverdrafts individually with\nstudents in a bid to cut down on\npeople going massively overdrawn\nfor long periods of time. They see\nthe overdraft as a method of tiding\nstudents over between grant\ncheques rather than a loan.\npackage. In an effort to combat the\nbadly overdrawn accounts that\nMidland are so worried about, they\nhave decided not to offer automatic\noverdrafts but to give away a VISA\ncard with the higher credit limit of\n\u00a3250, compared with the usual\n\u00a3100. In the words of the Co-op:\n\"We believe that it is far better to\nallow them to have a VISA card\nwith a modest credit limit and the\ntends to stay, so the banks will\nalways only be too ready to offer\njust that little bit more. However it\nis perhaps a sobering thought that\nwhen it comes down to the real gifts\nand freebies, they don't tend to be\nworth more than \u00a310 a time. Itisn't too much risk capital to invest in\nwhat can turn out to be very\nlucrative for them.\nfacilities, then appease them with\ncheque written on one of your other\ncheque books, or with cash drawn o one of your many credit cards.\nIt is important to open all\naccounts at the same time because,\nalthough banks are unlikely to check\nif you hold accounts at other banks,\nthey do ask, and I am reliably\ninformed that fraud is very naughty\nand one should not do it.\n\n"

If you are\ninterested come to our meeting\nin the Senior Common Room\n12.30pm to 2.30pm on Thursday\nOctober 9th and see Alan Foum,\nGeology 1.\nChess\nA fair amount of interest has\nbeen shown amongst the\nfresher s for the Chess Club.\nThere has also been a great deal\nof interest amongst regular\nparticipants of the Club from\nprevious years.\nThe Club is not only interested\nin those veterans who can play\nseemingly without flaw but also\nthose who enjoy the game\nirrespective of their standard.\nThe idea of a club at university is\nto enable people to participate in\nactivities that they would\notherwise not have the chance to\ntry. The Chess Club has many\nattractions in that it enables\nplayers of any standard to\nimprove their game and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere. The players\nare able to meet new people both\nin and out of the College, in a sociable atmosphere which is\noften lacking in other clubs. (I shall not mention any for fear of\ninsulting your intelligence and\nthe other clubs). The Chess Club\nis not only involved in playing\nplain chess as you might\nimagine. It also tries to diversify\nwith such things as lightning\nchess tournaments simultaneous exhibitions and different\nforms of chess (cross chess,\ncylindrical chess and others).\nNotably the lightning chess\ntournament is being held on\nOctober 9th.I would very much\nlike to see you there and if you\nwould like to discuss any\naspects of what I have written or\nof chess please do not hesitate to\napproach me (Haldane Broby\nLife Sci, Treasurer Chess Club)\nat the lightning tournament.\nThird World First\nUnknown to many at Imperial\nCollege there exists a small but\nthriving group called Third\nWorld First. The group is active\nin organising meetings, socials\nand campaigns for the Third\nWorld. During the term there will\nbe meetings exposing the work\nof Rio Tinto Zinc; Friends of the\nEarth will be talking about the\ndecimation of the Tropical\nRainforests. We have a campaign week organised for\nOctober 27th followed by a two\nday fast.\nThere are close links between\nThird World First and other\npressure groups such as\nAPTECH and joint meetings are\nplanned with over sea student\ngroups. Third World First is\nsupported by a hard core of\ndedicated people but it needs\nmore. If you are interested in\nwhat's going on in the World\ncome to our first meeting on 7th October or contact me or Helen\nUdy.\nAndrew Weller Met and Mat 3 or\nHelen Udy Life Sci 2.\nADVERTISEMENT\nStudent Services would like to thank all those\nstudents who helped over the summer with\norganising and running the overseas students'\nday, assisting in the office and generally being\nuseful.\nSSGA's are awarded to Mark Cottle, Rose\nHorley, Dave Jones (for tolerance), Tom MelliarSmith and Alan Rose.\nServices Colours are awarded to:\nAlan Clarke, Nick Green, Rob Perry, George\nPlumbley, Estelle Simpson, Hugh Southey,\nBriget Webster, Andrew Winterton (who did\nmore work before getting on the payroll), Chris\nMartin (for driving to Ascot) and Hairy Bob.\nAnd the special black coffee award to Carl\nBurgess, for taking the day off work with a hangover and spending ten hours working in\nStudents Services instead.

    "content": "Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 8\nOpportunity\nKnocks\nThe first Imperial College Union\nGeneral Meeting (UGM) is next\nTuesday at 1pm in the Great Hall.\nDONT MISS IT. It won't be like the\nConstituent College Union General\nMeetings that you had the chance\nto go to on Monday. It is your\nchance to run the Union. It is your\nchance to debate motions about\nreal issues. It is your chance to find\nout exactly what your sabbaticals\ndo.\nImperial College Union General\nMeetings are (hopefully) well\norganised meetings which have\nsome influence on College and\ncontrol the Union. They start with a reading of the minutes of the last\nmeeting and a discussion of the\nmatters arising. This is normally\nuncontroversial and is normally\ncompleted in five minutes.\nThe sabbaticals are then\nexpected to report on what they've\ndone since the last UGM. They will\nprepare a written report and then\nmake additions to it verbally. This\nreally is your chance to question\nyour sabbaticals because when\nthey've completed their verbal\nHugh Southey\nadditions you can quiz them about\nany aspect of their job. Sabbaticals\nare paid by you so it's worth trying\nto find out if they are really working\nfor you.\nAt some UGMs the Honorary\nSecretary reports as Returning\nOfficer. This means that he\norganises elections for Union posts.\nCCU Presidents and other\nofficers then make reports. These\nare usually just a list of facts.\nThe most controversial part of\nthe meetings is usually the motions\nwhich are detailed after the officers\nreports. Anyone can submit a motion about anything. If you want\nto submit a motion all you need to\ndo is submit a motion to Union\nHonorary Secretary Dave Colley a week in advance.\nThis order of business can be\nchanged by procedural orders but\n1\n1\n1 explain how these work at the\nmeeting.\nBelieve me, IC UGMs are\nimportant. They can change your\nresidence, bar, lectures so try and\nattend.\nJolly Hockey\nSticks!\nChristine Taig\nAs Freshers' Week goes on, the\nshadows under my eyes get bigger\nand blacker and my temper gets\nshorter! I hope you've been having a good A \u00bbeek and that your stamina's better than mine.\nOverseas Freshers' Reception\nDay\nMore than 200 people came along\nto the Overseas students' reception\nlast Sunday organised by the Union\nand Lesley Gillingham, the College\nWelfare Adviser. This is the first\ntime the Union has organised such\nan event and it seemed to go fairly\nsmoothly. Thank you to everyone\nwho turned up, I hope you enjoyed\nyourselves. If you've got any\nconstructive criticisms, do let me\nknow. Thanks also to everyone\nwho helped out, especially Norman\nJardine, for dealing with the food,\nwhich brings me to the subject of...\nThe Snack Bar\nFrom Monday October 6\n'Norman's' will be open in the\nevenings as well as lunchtimes, for\nsnacks and meals. The bar will also\nbe open, so now you can eat and\ndrink in comfortable surroundings\nin the Union Building\u2014good stuff,\nat low prices!
