    "content": "Students\nImperial College students often seem to be isolated from\nthe outside world. Life for many students appears to\ninvolve problem sheets, Union clubs and drinking. Few\npeople make the effort to find out about other Colleges.\nThere are two other Colleges with an International\nreputation in South Kensington, the Royal College of Art\nand the Royal College of Music, but most students show\nlittle interest in them. In an attempt to improve the\nsituation FELIX went and investigated the RCM and the\nRCA.\nRoyal College Of Music\nThe Royal College of Music is that odd Victorian\nBuilding situated between\nthe RS M building and the\nChemical Engineering department. It has about\n600 students, 120 of whom are postgraduates, who are\nmainly studying for the\nA RCM, a diploma with\ndegree status although\nsome are studying for\ndegrees. Most of their\nstudents stay at the College i for three or four years \u2022 Sue Gorton although some stay for a considerably longer period.\nThe RCM Students\nAssociation is the\norganisation that\nrepresents RCM students\nand organise social events.\nPresident Sue Gorton, a singer who has been at the\ncollege for five years, said\nthat the RCM S A tries to\nconcentrate on organising\nnon musical events such as\nfootball, pool and drama.\nThey had problems,\nthough, because most RCM students live a long way\nfrom the College. RCM students have worse\nproblems than most\nstudents living in London when they start looking for\na com mod ation because many landlords try to stop\nmusic students rehearsing.\nMiss Gorton said that there\nwere students living in\nGuildford because they\ncouldn't find anywhere\nnearer to live.\nThe R CSMA is also\nrestricted to organising\ncheap events because RCM Students have been hit\nbadly by the cuts. The removal of the travel\nsubsidy has made\naccommodation problems\nworse. One has little money when one has to travel\nfrom Guildford. The College has also been\nbadly hit by cuts. Cuts to\nCollege funding have\nmeant that extra lessons\nthat many students used to\ntake have been cut.\nLike IC students, most\nRCM students take very\nlittle notice of their\nneighbours. Musicians, according to Ms Gorton, only think about other\nmusicians. They only\nnotice IC students when\nthe RCM canteen is full of\nIC students. This doesn't mean, though, that the\nUnions don't get on. Ms Gorton said she had\ndiscussions with next year's ICU President Christine\nTaig about more joint\nsocial events. The RCM will\nprobably be represented at\nnext year's Fresher's Fair.\nShe encouraged IC\nstudents to form links. 'IC\nStudents are welcome to\ncome to anything we do'.\nRoyal College Of Art\nThe Royal College of Art is\nbased in the modern office\nblock in Jay Mey s( that's be in d Beit and next to the\nAlbert Hall). Although they\nhave buildings in other\nparts of South Kensington. The college is entirely\npostgraduate. It has about\n600 students who are\nstudying for MAs or PhDs. They are mainly funded by\ngrants from the Department\nof Education and Science.\nThe College has changed radically in the last two or\nthree years. The Rector\nJo c eyl n Stevens, the former\nboss of Express Newspapers, has set out to\nmake the College more\ncommercially minded. He has introduced central\nfunding so that\ndepartments are no longer\nfree to decide how they\nspend money they raise\nfrom outside sources. He has cut fine art courses and\nintroduced courses\ndesigned to satisfy\nindustry. As a result the\nDepartment of Education and Science which funds\nthe RCA directly has given\nthe RCA level funding in\nreal terms.\nRCA Union President\nTim Foster, who was a student in Industrial\nDesign, a course run jointly\nby IC and the RCA before\nbecoming a sabbatical, said\nthat the way the approach of the College to\ncommer ica lising itself was\nprobably right in the long\nterm. It was, though,\ncausing tremendous\nproblems to students in the\nshort term.\nThe RCA Union is a small one with, at present,\nno clubs or societies. This\nis mainly because all the\n\u2022 Tim Foster\nstudents are apathetic\npostgraduates and have to\nwork hard. The Union does,\nthough, run a bar and\nrefectory. It also provide\nEnts with Discos every\nThursday.\nMost RCA students think\nthat IC students are 'dead\nboring'. As a result they\nhave very few links with IC.\nEven students on the joint\ncourses are glad to be at\nthe RCA. The RCA Union has very little contact with\nIC Union. Mr Forster said\nthe only time he'd met\npeople from IC union was\nwhen FELIX had been to\nvisit him. He said, though,\nthat he was surprised that\nICU were still outside NUS. He said he didn't see what\nICU gains from being\noutside.\nMr Foster, though,\nencouraged IC stud nets to\nuse the RC A's facilities.\n'Don't be put off by the\nidea that we may be arty\nfar ty!' He said 'many of our\nstudents are very\nmercenary doing jobs for\ncommerce'. He encouraged IC students to go to the\nThursday disco.\nImperial College Union Life Membership\nYour chance to use Union facilities\nwhen you leave the College.

    "content": "[ di1 of ia\no\"O Libya\nIt looks as though the\nsquatters are soon to be\nevicted from the Libyan Consulate. Students in\nLondon have an almost\nimpossible task when they\nstart looking for\naccommodation. Accommodation is either\nmassively over priced or\ndisgusting or both. There\nare .though, in London, many large empty buildings\nwhich could be used to\naccommodate young people. The Libyan\nconsulate is a perfect\nexample. It could be used\nfor accommodation but the\nLibyan interest section of\nthe Saudi Arabian Embassy seems determined to keep\nthe building empty. The Government should be\nencouraging young people\nto squat rather than\nencouraging foreign\nem bassey s to evict them.\nUGC The University Grants\nCommittee has a difficult\njob. They are trying to\nguard standards in the\nuniversity sector while the\nGovernment makes savage\ncuts to their funding. Sir\nPeter S winner ton Dyer's recent statements have\nbeen amazingly realistic\nabout the problems facing\nthe universities. He has\n\u2022 attempted to draw attention\nto the problems facing\nhigher education. The Government, though, seems prepared to ignore\nhis warning. The only way\nthat the government can be\nmade to change its policies\nis if the middle classes who make up a significant\nproportion of Tory support\nrealise the damage the\nGovernment is doing. Many of these Tory voters are\nparents of university\nstudents. The universities\nshould try and inform these\nparents about the problems they are facing. Vice Chancellors of several\nuniversities, including\nDurham, have written to\nparents informing them of\nthe problems cuts are\ncausing. Tory voting\nparents take notice of such letters and write to their\nMPs. I don't understand\nwhy the Rector doesn't write to parents. It wouldn't cost much and would be an\nexcellent way of\npersuading the Government to change its policies.\nRCM and RCA On page ten of this issue\nyou'll see a feature on the\nRCA and the RCM. Both of\nthese colleges have\nfacilities that are open to IC\nstudents. Why not try and get involved with them? It's ridiculous that we should all be students in South Kensington yet we hardly\nmix. It would be great to\nget the other colleges involved with IC so that we can change the social life\nslightly by making it more\nartistic.

ISSN 1040-0711.\nSetting The\nRecord Straight\nDear Hugh, I was most concerned that\nProfessor Blow( Letters,\nlast week) should have\ninterpreted the remarks in\nmy annual report as an\nattack on the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee( USC). Let me\nmake it clear that I think\nthe committee is composed of academics who do care\nabout teaching, and that\nthey have all put a great\ndeal of effort into its work. I apologise if I gave a different impression in my report.\nPerhaps I should explain\nmore fully the points I was\nmaking in the sections\nreferred to by Prof Blow.\nWhen I said that the report\nwas being 'watered down' I didn't mean that\nunauthorized changes were\nbeing made, but that,\nconsciously or\nunconsciously, the more\nradical ideas were being\nsoftened to increase their\nacceptability to the Board of Studies ( BOS) this is not\nthe fault of the USC, but a product of their realistic\nassessment of the aptitudes\nof the wider body of their\ncolleagues. It was to this\nwider body that my second paragraph referred, not to\nthe USC, whose members I would specifically exclude from the charge.\nIn the report I also\nexpressed disappointment\nthat it did not prove\npossible to produce a report earlier in the year.\nThe fact the USC' s first\nreport will be considered by BOS in the summer vacation inevitably reduces\nits impact, on students at\nleast. I think this is\nunfortunate, since it\ndeserves the fullest\npossible debate, as Prof\nBlow points out in his\nletter. I did present a gloomy view of the\nprospects of significant\n\"hang es as a result of the\nUSC' s first report. This I still stand by after reading\nthe report now it has been\npublished. I feel that even if\nit is accepted the worst\ndepartment will safely be\nable to ignore many of its\nrecommendations, whilst\nthe more enlightened\ndepartments are already\nputting many of them into\neffect. However, this is not\nto say that the process is\nnot valuable. It is\nundoubtedly a step in the\nright direction, and will\nhopefully result in gradual\nimprovements and\nincreased awareness of the\nproblems, even if\nimmediate changes are not\nforthcoming.\nMy final pot e it is that this\nmust be the beginning of a longer process, rather than\na once-and-for-all step, a fact which I am sure Prof\nBlow is well aware of.\nYours sincerely,\nJ Martin Taylor\nICU AAO\nEating Our Words\nDear Hugh, Your feature article last\nweek about food and\nnutrition was most\ninteresting but contained\nmany inaccuracies. Firstly, it concentrated\ntoo much on modern fads,\nsuch as keeping your saturated fat content low,\nand eating lots of fibre.\nAdequate fibre levels can\nbe maintained just as easily\nby eating a correct portion\nof vegetable and fruits as\nby sprinkling everything\nwith Bran. Cholesterol is aster ol and not a fat, being\nderived in the body from\nAcetyl Coenzyme A, which is formed from\nCar be hydrates as well as\nfats. There are several\ntypes of cholesterol, only\none of which is thought to\nbe associated with heart\ndiesease. Saturated fat\nlevels and heart disease are\nstill open to debate, but at\nleast they are naturally\nproduced, unlike\nmargarine s, which go\nthrough many chemical processes, with the\naddition of vitamins to\nmake them more like\nbutter.\nBread is actually a good source of protein L containing between 12 to\n17% (even white bread!), so Chris' Ham Bap gives him\nmore than the protein from\nthe ham. However, bread,\nflour and most other grains\nare quite importantly\ndeficient in Lysine, and the\ncontent of one or two other\nessential amino acids is\nalso significantly lower. It is\na pity that protein was not\nmentioned in any depth in\nthe article, particularly with\nthe current popularity of\nvegetarianism amongst\nstudents. One of the best\nways of overcoming amino acid deficiencies is to eat a mixture of both grains\n(wheat being most\ncommon) and sweet corn, since the deficiencies tend\nto largely cancel each other\nout.

They are a four piece outfit who formed in the autumn term\ncomprising John Noble( Drums) Colin Wool d ridge( Guitar) and Vocals)\nRichard Hanan( Bass) and Ian Morris (Keyboards and\nVoacals). They're from\nChe mEng2 with the\nexception of Ian who hails\nfrom Ci vEng1. Duo play a dance able brand of pop rock which is\ndifficult to characterise,\nperhaps the best\nimpression of their sound can be gained by the fact\nthat they do a creditable\ncover version of 'Everybody\nWants to Rule the World'.\nThey are keen to avoid the\ncollege band tag and\nalthough concentrating on\ntheir degrees at present\nthey have well thought out\nplans for the future. Their\nmost recent gig was at the\nRag Fete party in the\nHolland club and this will\nbe their last for a while.\nOver the summer they have\nthree days booked in a studio to record a demo for\ncirculation to clubs and other potential venues,\nthereafter the lads are\nplaying it by ear. Hopefully\na string of gigs outside\ncollege will lead to greater\nthings - one can only wish\nthem luck. Significantly\nthey list as one of their best\ngigs so far an outside event\nat Nutford House. On this\noccasion Duo worked as\npart of a double\narrangement with Elec Eng student Hans Beier.

The combination of Duo and\nSolar Winds seem to work\nwell as an entertainment\npackage for parties etc.\nThe arrangement has cut\nA previous article\nmentioned that\nSchrodingers Cat were\nrecording a demo tape on a hired 16 track set up in IC\nRadio's studio. This is now complete and is available\nfrom John Lambert of\nPhysic 2 for the sum of\n\u00a33-50 (on chrome tape!)\nTitled \"Where The City\nDon't Go\", which was also\nthe title of their previous\ntape, it contains some of\nthe same tracks with the\naddition of \"War Ain'ta Game\" and a very silly\nversion of \" Johnny B. Goode\". Sound quality is a vast improvement on the\nprevious effort although I felt the production was a little unbalanced at points,\nespecially for the backing\nvocals which I had trouble\npicking out (you must bear\nin mind here that I'm slightly deaf - too many\nZodiac Mind warp gigs you\nknow!). Having said this i also thought \" No Hope\" benefited from a bit of\ncreative production and\n\" Apple Blossom\" from a piano arrangement. If\nanyone is interested in gigs\nduring the summer break\nI'm told that Schrod in ger's Cat are looking for a date\nin order to impress a nice\nman from a record\ncompany.

AND ROLL\nCollege administrator,\nMichael Arthur looks at the\nproblems caused by\nsupermarket trolleys.\nThe ubiquitous\nsupermarket trolley is\nprobably the most widely\nused form of transport\naround the College campus. Undoutedly, it is\nan extremely convenient\nve chile, ideally suited not\nonly to trundling the week's fodder home from\nSainsbury s but also to a multitude of other\ntasks\u2014shifting equipment,\nmoving to a new room and\ndelivering FELIX to name\nbut a few.\nUnfortunately, we have\nrather lost sight of the fact\nsupermarket trolleys belong\nin supermarkets.\nSainsburys don't even allow\nyou to take trolleys off their\nsite and Waitrose only do\nso on the understanding\nthat you are going to bring\nthem back. According to\nSainsbury's, around 600 of\ntheir trolleys disappear for\never each year from the\nCromwell Road branch\nalone. At \u00a350 a time plus\nthe cost of employing someone to scour the\nstreets for abandoned trolleys, they reckon they\nhave to sell over \u00a3600,000\nworth of groceries before\nthey recover the cost of\ntrolley abuse. This expense is reflected in higher prices\nat the tills.\nIn College terms, trolleys\nare a nuisance. A lot of\nmanpower goes into\nrounding up trolleys and\ngetting them back to the\nsupermarkets. This is\nparticularly so in Princes\nGardens and Evelyn\nGardens. Incidentally, if the\nresidence handymen spent\nless time chasing trolleys,\nthey could spend more\ntime improving residences.\nThe most serious\nconsequence, however, is\nthe effect on our relations\nwith neighbours and\nvisitors. Neighbours are\nimportant. Living close to a student community requires a fair level of\ntolerance at the best of\ntimes and we would do well\nnot to try their patience by\ncluttering up the place with\ntrolleys. The College has\nmany visitors and it does\nour image no good at all\nwhen they see that the best\na renowned centre of\nScience and Technology can do for transport is to\nsteal trolleys from\nsupermarkets.\nUnder the College Discipline code misconduct 'likely to affect the good name and standing of the\nCollege' is a disciplinary\noffence. Although no one\nhas ever been 'done' for\nstealing supermarket\ntrolleys, it clearly comes under this heading and it\nmay only be a matter of\ntime before the College feels that it has to take\naction to bring the trolley\nproblem under control.\nFELIX Friday 6 June 11\n\n"

    "content": "HY DON'T YOU GO BEFORE YOU SLAG IT OFF OK, I got it wrong, the start\nof the World Cup has not\nbeen quite as exciting as I predicted last week.\nYesterday's game between\nEngland and Portugal (I'm writing this at 8pm on\nWednesday evening) was one\nof the worst games of football\nI 've seen in a long time. The\nproblem seems to be the heat.\nAll the teams seem to be\nplaying at half speed. I really\nwonder if they should have\ngiven the finals to Mexico\nwhen one looks at the poor\nTV coverage and the terrible\nheat. Don't worry, though, the\niI work. Hockney is there as are\nhundreds of less well known.\nThere are several offers for IC\nstudents interested in going.\nThe old students associations\nhave organised a special\nshowing, a buffet and music\nfrom the IC Orchestra string\nquintet. Tickets are \u00a312.50\nwhich is excellent value for\nwhat should be a very special\nevening. The event is on July\n11th so if you're interested\ncontact the Old Students\nAssociation offices. If you can't afford the Old Students event,\nWH Smith have sponsored a series of concerts at the Royal\ntw rti football will get better. This\nweek we've got some excellent\ngames coming up. Game of\nthe week is probably Scotland\nv West Germany (Sunday, BBC\n7pm). At the time of writing\nScotland haven't played and\nWest Germany have drawn\nwith Uruguay 1-1. The West\nGermans, though, looked to\nme the best team I 've seen so\nfar in the competition. They\nmanaged to overcome the heat\nand look threatening for all of\nthe game. England play twice\nbut to be honest following last nights debacle I'm not sure\nthat I 'll be watching. I 've got\nbetter things to do then watch\nag me of football that's likely\nto be as exciting as paint\ndrying. For those patriots who\nare interested England play\nMorocco (Friday, ITV 11pm) and Poland (Wednesday, BBC\n11pm). One other game that\nwill be worth watching is\nUruguay v Denmark (Sunday,\nITV 11pm). Before I get too depressed\nabout the problems with the\nWorld Cup I'd better return\nto what's on in London. One\nof the features of the summer\nis the Royal Academy\nSummer Exhibition. Amateur\nand professional artists get the\nchance to show their best new-Academy. For \u00a33 you get the\nopportunity to listen to some\nof the best classical music\ngoing and to view the\nexhibition. The concerts are\non Thursdays between 26th June and 17th July. These\nconcerts are highly\nre com ended. You can find\nmore details by ringing Youth\nand Music on 01-379 6722.\nReturning to more\nconventional Capital Ideas\nSaturday seems to be a good\nday for going to a gig.\nDesmond Dekker (you know\nthe guy who did Isrealites) is\nplaying the Sir George Robey.\nSo if you fancy some good\nreggae/ska then get up to\nIslington for some crucial\nrhythms. On the subject of\nSka, Bad Manners play the\nLord Cecil on the same night.\nBad Manners have got to be\none of the all-time best dance\nbands. If you want something\na little more relaxed, Mint\nJuleps play the Half Moon on\nSaturday. Mint Julips are one\nof the brilliant new vocal\nbands that seem to have\nsprung up. All in all if the feet\nare tapping the night away on\nSaturday you'll only have\nyourself to blame.\nTo be honest there are\nvirtually no other decent gigs\ncoming up in the near future.\nNever mind I suppose things\nmust improve. When they do,\nthough, I 'll be out of London\nso I suppose I'm not going to\nbenefit. Its typical really.\nGenerally London seems a little dead at the moment.\nEngland are playing India in\nthe test match at Lords and to\nbe honest this is the only event\nthat I fancy going to (other\nthan the musical events\nli sited). England have got to\nwin this match if David Gower\nis to remain as captain. To be\nhonest I don't think he\ndeserves to stay. His\nperformance in the West\nIndies was a disgrace. Unlike\nMike Gatting he seems to have\nno pride for England. He\nhardly seems to try when he\nleads an England team.\nOne final Capital Idea.\nWhy not go and see some\nopera? The English National\nOpera and the Royal Opera\nare two of the world's leading\nopera companies and its not\nthat expensive to go and see\nthem. Opera conjures up\nimages of dinner jackets and\nfunny singing. It is, though,\namazingly powerful and\nromantic. Why don't you go\nonce before you slag it off.\nAnyway I'd better stop\nwriting. The more I write the\nworse my style becomes. I hope though I 've given you\nsome ideas about what to do\nwhen those exams are over.\n\n"

Both Miami\nVice and To Live and Die in\nLA involve a crime busting\npartnership in parts of the\nworld but where they differ\nis in the portrayal of their\nsubjects, the former is\noften rather clumsy and\nunimaginative storytelling\nand frequently little more\nthan an overly long pop\nvideo, whereas the latter\nhas some very imaginative\nediting of both sound and\nvision. Further in the\ntelevision programme, for\nall it's stylised violence,\nsomehow people don't seem to get hurt; in the film\nyou really can feel when\nsomeone gets beaten up.\nThe partnership in the\nfilm initially consists of an\nolder agent who wants one\nlast big bust of a famous\ncounterfeiter before retiring\nand a younger more\nambi to us man, William L Peterson. In trying to\nsecure the arrest single\nhanded the elder man is\nkilled. His partner is then\ndetermined to catch the evil\nlawbreaker, played in a little too exaggerated\nmanner by Willem Dafoe,\nusing whatever means he\ncan. To assist him and\nreplace his former partner\nhe is reluctantly assigned a younger more moral agent,\nwhose dilemmas and tears\nare very convincingly\nportrayed.\nme f \u2022Jim's had a hard week.\nContinuing the theme of\naction movie brings me to\nBiggies. Oh dear. In\nattempting to portray\nBiggies seriously and avoid\nmaking another spoof,\nBiggies has been relegated\nto a supporting role for a young modern American,\nyes, modern. The film\nmakers believed, possibly\nwith good reason that\nmodern audiences would\nnot be able to swallow a straight Biggies film so\nthey had the wacky idea of\nmaking a fast food\nmanufacturer Biggies' time\ntwin, which seems to me to\nbe an idea which is about\nas digestible as the TV\nDinners the young hero\nsells.\nHowever in trying to\nappeal to a greater\naudience the film fails to hit\nit's target (in fact it doesn't even wing the b lighter) and\nin spite of Neil Dickson,\n(who makes an excellent\nBiggies), the impressive\nstunt flying and the fact\nthat an old .school friend of\nmine plays Ginger I can't really rate this film very\npeoples faces and lives. Yet\nhis wife's love of Fred, and\nher intimate knowledge of\nhis habits and his\nappearance is an often\nspoken but soon forgotten\nsecret between them.\nThe play draws heavily\nfrom lone sco, Beckett and\nPinter for its, effect, so\nclosely, in fact, as to be\nalmost rigid and lifeless.\nSome fine moments of\nhumour help to alleviate\nthe irritating repetitive ness of Mr Pringle, a labour ed character well handled by\nMalcolm Frederick. Corinne\nSkinner Carter as his wife,\nis given far more scope and\nemotional depth, and\nhandles her part well.\nAlas, Poor Fred is at the\nBattersea Arts Centre until\nthe 8th June, and opens for\ntwo days at the North\nPeckham Civic Centre on\nthe 12th. by Jim Clayden.\nhighly.\nAnother somewhat\ndisappointing film is Paul\nMatursky's Down and Out\nin Beverely Hills which\nstarts off well as a satire on\nthe lives of the rich folks in\nBeverely Hills but\nultimately pulls it's punches\nand ends up as a vindication of the lifestyle\nthe Great American Dream.\nThe characters are the\nstreet person (tramp), a wealthy coat hanger\nmanufacturer, his repressed\nwife who hires gurus to\nassist her enlightenment,\ntheir daughter 'a blur with a nice smell' and their son\nwhose inability to\ncommunicate with his\nparents result in him\nleaving videos for them to\nwatch which provides one\nof the better jokes. The\nbest characters are the\nMexican maid, the\nmarvellous Magritte the\ndog and the brilliant dog\npsychiatrist whose skills\nenable him to diagnose\nnipple ancestry in Magritte\nand to suggest that he may\nhave come from a nine dog\nlitter, but his presence is al\ntoo short lived.\nThe film concerns itself\nwith the way the tramp's arrival into the family\naffects the lives of all it's members and how their\nneuroses are cured by the\nwisdom of this free man.\nUnfortunately it merely\nreaffirms the Great\nAmerican way which once\nagain seems to include the\nnotion that foreigners are\nfigures of fun. Pity, it coul c have been very good ra the th n just funny in parts.\n'Euroshima is Laurie Booth's poignant ballet about the\npower of nations. Taking the\nbombing of Hiroshima in 1945\nas a reference point, Booth\nand his company, The Cargo\nCult, set off to explore issues\nsuch as communication\nbetween countries, national\ndefence and the constant fear\nof attack, using movement and\nmotifs rooted in Oriental\nculture. Heavy? Not quite.\nWhilst the dancers are both\nexpressive and versatile, their\nwork is punctuated with\ninformal and amusing gestures\nand expressions in a nonchalant attempt to talk to\nthe audience through speech\nrather than movement. The\nshow is complemented by an\nexcellent set from John\nNewton, and runs at the I.C.A. until tomorrow.BJofm Burgess'\n9\n\n"

    "content": "The Week In\nTime Out Meets Tomorrow's World\nThymus Key To\nAIDS Vaccine?\nResearch published last\nweek in Science shows a possible leap forward in the\nfight against acquired\nimmune deficiency\nsyndrome (AIDS). The\nAIDS Virus attacks Tlymphocyte cells, special\nwhite block cells that are\npart of the immune system.\nThere is unfortunate\nconfusion about Tlymphocyte cells, even\namong the scientific\npopulation (Letters, 30\nMay). White blood cells are\nproduced in the bone\nmarrow: lymphocytes are\nalso produced in the\nspleen, the lymph nodes\nand the thymus. (The\nthymus, as every O level\nbiologist knows, is a gland\nfound in the root of the\nneck, mostly under the\ncover of the upper part of\nthe sternum: it consists\nlargely of developing\nlymphocytes.) Bone\nmarrow derived\nClay-brained\nHippo Scheme\nStudents at California\nInstitute of Technology\ndon't seem to think much\nof SDI, the so-called Star\nWars project. In April they\nheld a competition to see\nwho could propose the\nmost 'des tabi lising, unworkable, or incredibly\nexpensive' scheme to\nthan air.\nUnder imminent enemy\nattack, the animals would\nbe released from the cage\nto form an optically thick\ncascade of buoyant hippos.\nWhen the mean hippo\ndensity became equal to\nthe atmospheric density\n(hy p pop a use), the hippos\nachieve SDI's goals\n{Nature, 22 May).\nThe winning entry came\nfrom student Greg\nOjakangas, who suggests\ndeveloping a genetically\nengineered strain of pygmy\nhippopotamus. The animals\nwould be fed on a diet rich\nin radioactive materials,\nand then placed in cages\ncontaining cathodes. A continuous stream of\nelectrons would convert the\nalpha-particles radiated by\nthe hippos' food into\nhelium. The hippos would\ngradually inflate with\nhelium, becoming lighter\nwould provide Readily\nOperative Overhead\nProtection by Hippos\n(ROOPH). The hippos\nwould slowly deflate,\nfloating gently back to\nearth after two days, when\nthey could be collected\nand, presumably,\nreprocessed.\nIt is estimated that the\nscheme would cost $457\nmillion: all enquiries to IC\nResearch Contracts Office,\nSherfield Building; any\nsimilar proposals to the\nFELIX Office by\nWednesday 11 June. (\u00a35\nprize for best entry).\nlymphocytes are termed Bcell lymphocytes. Thymusderived lymphocytes are\ntermed T cell lymphocytes.\nT cells attack antigens\ndirectly at close range only;\nB cells attack antigens by\nsecreting antibodies.\nA hormone of the\nthymus, called thy mos in, helps to regulate T cells.\nWith most immune-deficiency diseases, levels\nof thy mos in are depressed,\nbut researchers at the\nGeorge Washington\nUniversity, US, have found\nwhat appeared to be high\nlevels of thy mos in in more\nthan half of the AIDS\npatients they examined.\nThe explanation that the\nresearchers put forward is\nthat a protein of the AIDS\nvirus closely resembles\nthy mos in. This might\nexplain why the immune\nsystem is unable to cope\nwith AIDS; antibodies that\nattack the viral protein may\nalso attack thy mos in, a suggestion supported by\nthe observation that AIDS\npatients suffer considerable\ndamage to the thymus.\nThe theory has been\ntested by injecting rabbits\nwith a synthetic version of\nthe hormone thy mos in. The\nrabbits' immune systems\nwere found to produce\nantibodies against the\nhormone: the hope was\nthat these antibodies would\nalso act against the protein\nat the core of the AIDS\nvirus in-humans. The\nresults are encouraging:\nthe rabbit antibodies\nreduced viral replication in\nthe infected human cells by\nmore than one-half. When\nthe antibody was mixed\nwith an immunoglobulin,\nlevels of viral proteins were\nsignificantly reduced, and\nproduction of reverse\ntranscriptase (See FELIX,\n16 May) was halted.\nThe catch is that\nthy mos in itself might evoke\na similiar response, and\ncause the body to attack\nthe thymus, warn the\nresearchers.\nNine cleaners\nwanted for the\nweekend after the\nend of term.

    "content": "Opinion\n\u00a7I Law And Order:\nS Has It Eroded Your\nCivil Liberties?\nI Over the last few years the Conservative government have\nI started to pass considerable changes in the criminal law.\nThese changes will significantly affected our rights as\nBritish residents. The Conservatives claim that these new\nlaws significantly improve the police's chances of keeping\nlaw and order but how serious are the effects on our civil\nrights? in this opinion article Hugh Southey looks at the\neffect of these new laws\nAll the major political\nparties agree that crime is\ngrowing at an alarming\nrate. Since1979, when the\nConservative party came to\npower, riots have become a feature of inner city life, the\nnumber of offences\nrecorded by the police has\ngone up by 41%, violent\ncrime has gone up by 40%\netc, etc. This isn't meant to\nbe a criticism of the\nConservative government,\ncrime was rising at an\nalarming rate when Labour were in power, its meant to\nillustrate the problems\nfacing the Government. All\nthe political parties agree\nthe need for changes in the\nlaw to cope with increased\ncriminal activity. They don't agree how this change should be achieved.\nWhen the Conservatives\ncame to power in 1979,\nthey decided to boost the\npolice in an attempt to\ncontrol the law and order\nproblem. The Conservatives\nhave increased expenditure\non the police by more than\na third in real terms, police\nmanpower has increased\nby over 13,000 and police\npay has increased by\n111.1%. This, though, has\nreally failed to control\ncrime. The figures\nmentioned earlier show that\nlaw and order is still a major problem. The annual\npromises that are made at\nConservative party\nconferences to improve law\nand order show that the\nConservatives are worried.\nIn an attempt to support\nthe police in their efforts,\nthe Conservatives started to\npass new laws. By the time\nyou return to College in\nOctober the Public Order Bill is likely to have\nbecome law. This and the\nPolice and Criminal\nEvidence Act are the\nConservative's attempts at\nlegislation. The effect they\nwill have on the crime rates\nis, at present, difficult to\ngauge. The effect they will\nhave on civil lib i ties is very\nserious.\nThe Public Order Bill is\nan attempt to control mass\nlawlessness. The eighties\nhas seen num oro us large\nscale battles between the\npolice and the public.\nBattles at Brixton,\nOrgreave, Stonehenge and\nfootball grounds, city\ncentres and picket lines all\nover the country have been\na feature of law and order\nsince the present\ngovernment have come to\npower. Most people would\nagree that situations like\nthese have got to be\nprevented. Whether you\nbelieve the pickets or the\npolice caused the trouble at\nWapping, mass riots, such as the one outside the\nNews International plant,\nhave got to be prevented.\nSociety can not tolerate the\nnumber of injuries that\noccur on such occasions. The Conservatives have set\nout to ban events that\nmight end in a riot. They have given the police the\nright to control the size,\nlocation and duration of\nstatic demonstrations and\nmeetings. They have given\nthe police the right to\nimpose restrictions on\nmarches if they fear\n'serious disruption to the\nlocal community' or 'the\ncoercion of the individual'.\nThey require the organisers\nof marches to give the\npolice seven days notice of\nany march. They have\ntightened the law on\nincitement of racial hatred.\nThey have created a new\noffence of disorderly\nconduct. Finally they have\ngiven the police the power\nto ban specific marches.\nMany groups, including\nthe Labour Party and the\nAlliance, have opposed parts of this Bill. Groups are already threatening to\norganise mass illegal\ndemonstrations to protest\nagainst this legislation. One group has already\nadvertised for people to\nagree to act as organisers\nof an illegal demonstration.\nThe idea of this is that a large number of people will\nreply and agree to act as\norganisers so that the\npolice have to arrest\nmillions of organisers.\nTrade Unions are\nprotesting because they\nfear that they will lose their\nright to organise large\ndemonstrations that show the labour movements\nsolidarity with strikers.\nPressure groups are also\nworried that they will lose\ntheir right to protest\nbecause the police will\ndecide that the\ndemonstration disrupts the\nlocal com unity( even\nthough a significant\nproportion of the local\ncom unity may want to\nprotest).\nOrdinary members of the\npublic, though, remain\nignorant of the worrying\nimplications of this act. The press (particularly the\ntabloid press) haven't considered the important\ncivil liberties questions that\nthe Bill poses. Is it more\nimportant that you have a right to demonstrate about\nthings that worry you or\nthat the odd event likely to\ncause trouble is banned? Is\nit important that you have\nthe right to demonstrate\nabout an issue of\nimmediate concern( the\nnew law would prevent\nspontaneous demonstrations when mass\nredundancies are\nannounced for example)?\nIs the ban really going to\nhave any effect when the\nsort of people who go to\ndemonstrations that may\nend in trouble are unlikely\nto take any notice of a 'repressive' police ban (the\ntroubles in Northern Ireland\nhave shown that bans on\nmarches have very little\neffect when people are out\nto cause trouble)? Could the police ban events which\nare on the political fringes\nbut unlikely to end in\ntrouble? Could the police\nban events like Stonehenge which have had a bad \u2022\npress? Last year the police\nsmashed up the Peace convoy while it was on its\nway to Stonehenge. These people weren't out for\ntrouble. Everyone knows\nthat hippy s are peaceful\npeople. Many of the hippy s had their families. They wanted to go to a peaceful\nrock concert. The police,\nthough, attacked the hippy s because, in my view, the\ntabloid media had created a myth of drug crazed violent\nhippy s rampaging through\nthe South West of England. Why shouldn't these people\nhold a pop concert\nproviding they don't break\nany laws like trespass? At\npresent the Police can only\nhave the hippies evicted\nfrom a particular site if the\nlandlord obtains a court\norder. If the Public Order Bill is passed the Police will\nbe able to ban the\nStonehenge festival.\nThe Police And Criminal\nAct is very different to the\nPublic Order Bill.\nAccording to a Conservative Party press\nrelease it seeks to\nmodernise and clarify\npolice powers and\nsafeguard the citizens\npowers. The law is a very\ncomplicated and long piece\nof legislation. Many of the\nsections of the act are only\nattempts to clear up the\nvery complicated and\nconfusing case law that\ngoverns police procedure.\n12 Friday 6 June FELIX\n\n"

And why not\u2014the\nprocess produces a lot of\ngood will among the\n'Student leaders' since they\nare seen to have achieved\nsomething, and the\n;\ndepartment usually doesn't have to spend much money or time getting it done. This\nis why so many Dep Rep i candidates this year are\nI looking to set such I common rooms up.\nJust how useful are UG Common Rooms though? They should arguably\nprovide a 'centre for social\nactivity with the\ndepartment', be a place for\nUG' s to gather when not in\nlectures, or maybe even act\nas study rooms in the\nevenings when libraries are\nfull or not available. But\njust how much are the\ncurrent schemes merely\npaying lip service to these\nreasonable ambitions?\nI fear I must now lower\nmy cover to an extent and\ntalk about the scheme for a'UG common room' in\nPhysics. As it stands at the\nmoment, this involves\ncarpeting 30 feet of\ndesignated fire escape corridor, lining it with seats\n(not very many will fit in\nthe space \u2014 about30 maybe) and adding such salubrious items as potted\nplants and, to keep one of\nthe Acc Reps happy, a mural! Not a bad little\nscheme to spend \u00a32000 on\nyou might think. Then yo .\nrealise that Physics has\nnearly 600\nundergraduates\u2014are all of\nthese meant to fit in the\nCommon Room \u2014 ( You probably have to stick them\nto the ceiling). A seminar room at least the size of the\nMaths Common Room is\nreally needed. And Carpeting? When you\nrealise that a coffee\nmachine is plumbed into\nthe same corridor, and road workers and bus\ndrivers are frequent\nvi is i tors,I think you'll\nrealise that the carpet, a large percentage of the\ncost, will not last long.\nAnd what will become of\nthis ' Common Room'? If\nthe current incarnation of\nthe Physics Common Room is anything to go by,\n(another fire corridor on\nlevel 1, larger indeed, than\nthe planned replacement)\nthe group of people who spend a lot of time there\nwill grow up to be termed\nobjectionable hacks by\nmany and everyone else\nwill avoid it.\nAs I 've already discussed the proposed new Physics Common Room will not be\nas useful to members of\nthat Department as it.\nseems at first sight. Indeed\nmany of the problems of\nthe proposed scheme are\nobvious, so why is the\nscheme going ahead? I have already proposed that\nthe Department views this\nas a good away of being\nseen to be looking after the\nstudents' interests. From the Departmental and other\nReps' point of view, they\ntoo can be seen to be\nachieving something, and \u00a32000 squeezed out of a departmental slush fund\nlooks impressive even if it\nis to be spent unwisely.\nIn this particular case it\ncan be seen as very good pre-election publicity for\nSimon Singh's further\npolitical interests in R CSU( helping his election to\nnext years presidency no\nend) and beyond. The end\nresult is that the\nDepartment benefit from\nappeasing the student reps\nand the reps benefit from\nbeing seen to have screwed money out of the\nDepartment, so helping\ntheir future election\nchances. And the students.\nIn Physics at least they'll be\nleft with a much too small common room with a carpet nobody wants\ndecorated with an Acc Rep's amateur artwork and .\nnone of it working very-well..\nIts enough to shake your faith in democracy isn't it?\n(What faith..).\nAnon of Ibid.\nFriday 6 June FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Libyan diplomats apply for posse sion order on Consulate jiM BiM LM Squatters May pj j Libyan diplomats have started\nHigh Court proceedings to have\nthe squatters evicted from the\nformer Libyan Consulate in\nPrinces Gate. An application for\na possession order on the\nbuilding was adjourned by Mr\nJustice Allot after a brief private\nhearing on Tuesday.\nFELIX contacted the Libyan\ninterest section of the Saudi\nArabian Embassy who have\ndealt with Libyan interests in\nLondon since Britain broke off\ndiplomatic relations with Libya.\nA Libyan diplomat claimed to\nknow nothing about the court\ncase and said that he didn't speak to the press. A Foreign\nOffice official told FELIX that\nthey were unaware of the\npresent position as the building\nwas no longer a diplomatic\npremise because it wasn't used\nfor diplomatic purposes. He did\nsay though, that the Foreign\nOffice had encouraged the\nSaudis to take action as they\nthought the squatters were a nuisance. A spokesman for\nDepartment of the Environment,\nwho own the building said that\nhe knew about the squatters.\nFELIX attempted to contact\nthe residents on Wednesday but\nthey got no reply when a' e porter called at the Consulate. \u2022 The Libyan Consulate\nPolice sources say that the\nSaudis have been encouraged to take action by local residents\nwho have complained about the\nsquatters. They were\nparti clu a rly upset about the\nparty held in the Consulate last\nFriday.\nIn a separate incident the fire\nb rid gade were called to the\nConsulate on Tuesday when a emergency generator that the\nresidents had started in a attempt to provide electricity for\nthe lights started to produce smoke. Nobody was hurt and the incident was soon under\ncontrol.\nUniversities Wil Close\nUniversities will be cio sed if the\nGovernment fails to provide\nextra money, Sir Peter\nSwinerton-Dyer, Chairman of\nthe University Grants\nCommittee told Vice\nChancellors last week.\nSir Peter told the chancellors that no member of the UGC believed 'that the university\nsystem can be preserved at its\npresent size and excellence or.\nthe amount of money which the\nGovernment has said it will\nmake available', he added that\nrecent suggestions of slightly\nincreased funding for\nuniversities were 'too little and too late'.\nRecent huge increases in\nrates and the prospect of large\npay rises for university staff\nmeant that the financial\nprospects for universities had\nchanged from 'depressing to\ndisastrous!' accord in o to Sir PeteFree!\nSir Peter made reference to\nthe recent statement that he\nwould be willing to consider increased funding for\nuniversities if there was real\nprogress in selectively,\nrationalization of small\ndepartments, better financial\nmanagement and improved\nteaching. He said; that\nuniversities should take the\noffer seriously and the\nqualifications should not be\nregarded as rhetoric.\nUniversities must be more\nselective, There is hardly an\ninstitution which can plausibly\nsay all our departments are\nequally strong'.\nTo be strong departments\nmust be of a reasonable size, he\nsaid 'closure of small\ndepartments is not only a means of economy; it is the way to preserve subjects, in\nparticular small subjects, in\ngood health.'\nSir Peter said that constant\neffort was needed to keep up\nteaching standards. He said all\nteachers could not be\ncharismatic but all had a duty to\nbe competent.\nStolen\nTwo hang gliders were stolen\nfrom outside the Biochemistry\ndepartment. David Evans, a Biochemistry student, left the\nhang gliders, which belonged to\nthe Union Hang Gliding Club, outside the department while he\nwent on holiday for two weeks.\nWhen he returned the gliders\nhad gone. College Security told\nFELIX they were unaware who had removed the gliders which they said were worth\napproximately \u00a31000.

    "content": "These do attempt to, in the\nwords of the Conservative\npress release, safeguard\ncitizens rights. Some of the\nsections of the Act, though,\nseverely erode the citizens\nrights. The police are now\nable to get a warrant to\nsearch the house or office\nof someone who isn't\" suspected of a crime (there\nare certain limited\nexceptions to this clause\nthat exempt members of\nthe caring professions who\nkeep records as part of\ntheir work eg doctors and\npriests). The police are able\nto stop and search people\nin the street, set up\nroadblocks, arrest suspects\nand take fingerprints. The\npolice are able to detain\nsomeone suspected of a serious offence for four\ndays (six if over a weekend) with no right to\nsee a solicitor for thirty six\nhours. Finally the police\nhave the right to authorise\nintimate body searches\n(including the anus and the\nvagina) of certain suspects.\nAgain the Labour party\nand the Alliance oppose\ncertain,aspects of the Act.\nThe Labour party describe\nthe Act as an attempt to\nreplace policing by consent\nwith policing by coercion.\nThe Labour party is\ncommited to repeal the Act.\nThe SDP, though, believes\nthat such drastic action\nwould be damaging to the\nissue of police powers. It\nbelieves that sections of the\nact should be amended.\nAgain the majority of the\ngeneral public have failed\nto realise how parts of this\nact will affect their rights.\nWhen the Act was passed a few journalists complained\nbecause they were worried\nthat the police would get\nthe right to search their\nrecords to find evidence.\nMost of the other sections\nof the Act have been\nignored by the media.\nMost people haven't thought about what\nhappens if the police\ndecide to hassle someone\nthey don't like by using the\npowers for stop and search\netc repeatedly? What's to\nstop the police removing\n(by accident of course)\ninnocent documents about\npolice brutality while they\nsearch the home of\nsomeone who they suspect\nhas evidence relating to\nanother case? What's to\nsay that suspects won't make confessions because\nthey have been held\nwithout seeing their\nsolicitor for thirty six\nhours? Thirty six hours is a long time to be held in a hostile environment without\nany friendly advice. The\nrecent case of two\nManchester students who\nappear to have been\nhassled by certain police\nofficers for over a year\nbecause they gave\nevidence about police\nbrutality shows that the\npolice can be very\nvindictive when they want\nto.\nThe problem with all\nthese pieces of legislation\nis they assume that the\npolice are a sort of\nsuperhuman body who are\nalways decent, honest and\ntruthful. The unfortunate\nfact is they aren't. The\npolice force is made up of\nordinary people. Nobody\nshould expect it to be\nperfect. Policemen, like any\nhuman, will react badly in\ncertain situations. They\nmay well try to gain\nrevenge. Recent cases of\npolice brutality show that\npolicemen may well react\nviolently to people who\nhave 'annoyed' them. In the\neighties there are\nnumerous occasions when\nthe police are likely to be\n'annoyed'. Who can blame\npolicemen who have been\npelted by stones from\npickets for hours for\nbecoming 'annoyed'? They\nmay well have a grudge\nagainst the labour\nmovement for a long time.\nAll this is unfortunate but\nhuman nature. The law,\nthough, should attempt to\nminimise the opportunities\nfor the Police to abuse their\npowers to gain revenge. It\nshould also minimise the\npolice's opportunities to\nuse the law for political\nreasons. Again the police\nare only human. People\nwho feel strongly about\npolitics will do a lot to get\ntheir views adopted. Who\ncan blame a policeman\nwho uses his powers for\npolitical gain? He shouldn't be put in a position where\nhe has the opportunity to\nuse his powers for political\ngain.\nIn any non-anarchic\nsociety the Police will have\ncertain powers which they\ncan abuse or use. A democratic society should\ndecide whether the\npossible loss of civil lib i ties is worth the associated\nreduction in crime\n(assuming there is any).\nThe new powers have\neroded civil liberties to a significant extent but\nhaven't improved the law\nand order situation. In my\nview law and order will only\nimprove significantly when\nsocieties problems are\nreduced. William Whitelaw\nMP summed it up in 1978\nwhen he was Shadow\nHome Secretary. He said 'if\nboys and girls do not\nobtain jobs when they leave\nschool, they feel that\nsociety has no need of\nthem. If they feel that, they\ndo not see any reason why\nthey should take part in\nthat society and comply\nwith its rules'. Society must\nattempt to persuade the\nyoung unemployed, who\nare almost outside society,\nthat law and order needs to\nbe obeyed before our civil\nlib i ties are eroded further.\nThat can't be done with\nmore repressive laws, it has\nto be done by showing that\nsociety cares about all its\nmembers, not just the\npeople with money and\njobs. The present laws are\nan attempt to reduce crime\nby making it more difficult\nto commit the crime. Will\nsuch tactics may work in\nthe sort term, in the long\nterm society will have to\nsolve the problems that\ncreate crime.\nI'm not going to discuss\nhow society can show that\nit cares, that's a political\nargument about economics\nand this is an article about\ncivil liberties, I just want to\nend by saying that this\narticle is aimed at getting\nyou to think about whether\nyour civil liberties have\nbeen eroded. I believe that\nwe need a strong police\nforce. I also, though,\nbelieve that police can 'only\nwork effectively if they have\nthe confidence and cooperation of the public'\n(quote from a Conservative\npolicy document). This\nmeans that police can't be\nseen to repressive. They\ncan't be seen to have\npowers that limit our civil\nliberties. The police must\nbe seen to be as faultless\nas possible. This I believe\ncan not come about if they\nare having to work with\nlaws, such as the Criminal\nEvidence Act and the\nPublic Order Bill, which are '\nopen to abuse.\nRelease are an organisation who provide an\nunbiased source of information for those\narrested. If you get in trouble with the Police\nyou can contact them on 603 8654 if its an\nemergency, alternatively you can ring them for\nan appointment on 837 5602. Release also have\nvery useful cards giving a simple guide to what\nto do if you get arrested. These can be\nobtained by ringing Release on 837 5602 and\ntalking to them nicely.\nFELIX Friday 6 June 13\n\n"

    "content": "Indians practice, but it is\nimportant to eat them at\nthe same meal. Amino\nacids are not stored for\nlong, and if they are not\nsoon converted into\nprotein, they are broken\ndown and excreted. So\nsweet corn for lunch and\nwheat for dinner will not\ngive the same nutritional\nrequirement. It is obviously\nimportant to ensure that\nthe correct amino acid\nbalance is eaten for good\nhealth. The problem\nbecomes even more critical\nfor Vegans. Unfortunately,\nanimal products have a better balance than plant\nproducts. With wise and\ninformed eating however,\nthe amino acid def ici en ces can be minimise d. However, it is wise to note\nthat women who are\nVegans, are often advised\nto eat wider varieties of\nfood when pregnant, in\norder to avoid severe\ndeficiencies and foetal\nmalformations, the advice\nusually being to include at\nleast some dairy products\nduring gestation.\nThe comment about\npeanuts being a good\nsource of protein is also\nslightly incorrect. Whilst\nthe protein content of such\nnuts is high, it is bound in\na complex way, such that it\nis largely indigestible once\neaten so the gain is very\nmuch lower than would\nappear. This problem\ncomes in part from the\nmethods used to quantify\nthe nutritional content of\nfoods. These are all carried\nout chemically, usually\nunder severe conditions\nwhilst the content may be\nas analysed, the ease with\nwhich an individual's digestive system can\nrecover these nutrients is\nwidely variable, a fact often\nforgotten by nutrition a lists. Although enzymes are\nwonderful things, they do\nnot always produce the\nsame results as extreme\nchemical modification. It is\nalso well known that\nindividuals often have an\nenzyme def ien cy through\ngenetic reasons, and given\nthe complexities of the\ndigestion and metabolic\nprocesses, it is likely that\nwe all differ from each\nother in at least a few\nenzymes.\nFinally, beer!

A Midsummer Nights Dream until the 21st June.\nThought by md ny to be a play within a play written\nas entertainment for a great\nlate-16th century wedding, Cheek by Jowl's production\nof A Midsummer Night's Dream returns Shakespeare to the ' common' person.\nDeclan Donnellan and Nick\nOr me rod the Director and Designer, deserve acclaim and praise for^their vision\nand imagination; co'up le this to an able and versatile\ncast, who seemed to be\ndoing much more than\ngoing through the motions,\nand the result is an evening\nto remember.\nAfter more than a year\ntouring, from Rio to\nKathmandu, a handful of\nperformances remain; it is a matter of urgency that any theatre goer sees Cheek by\nJowl's A Midsummer\nNight's Dream.\nSet in Athens and a fairy-infested wood nearby, the\naction involves four groups of characters: The Duke, and soon to be Duchatfe of\nAthens who's impending marriage gives rise to the\nplay; four confused young lovers who run away to the\nwood in an effort to sort\nout their romantic\nproblems; The fairies who occupy the wood and have\npower over all who enter,\nand a band of 'actors' who enter the wood to rehearse\nTheatre \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe Nest by Franz Xaver\nKroetz, The Bush Theatre\nuntil 21 June\nThe translation of this\ncon temp ary German play\nattempts to recreate the\nrealism of the seemingly\nordinary relationship\nbetween a lorry driver,\nKurt, and his pregnant tie-making wife, Martha.\nUnfortunately, the Bush Theatre's production of The\nNest achieves little in terms\nof making any real\ncontribution to the \"\nunderstanding of the 'man\nor woman in the street',\nwhich is what it seems to\nset out to do.\nOn entering the ' L' shaped theatre, it is not at\nfirst obvious where the\nstage is. However, as the\nplay begins it becomes apparent that the wall of\ngauze-like material in-front\nof the seating area is to be\nused as a screen through\nwhich the action is viewed\".\nImages on the 'stage'\nbehind the screen are only\nvisible when illuminated.\nThis effect allows a large\nnumber of simple set\nchanges to occur since the\naudience is unable to see\nthrough the gauze when\nthe stage is un lit. The plot revolves around the birth of a baby boy and the effect this has on the\nproud Kurt and Martha.\nKurt is a worker, a' good' father. He works to provide\nfor his family and to pay for\nall the requirements of a new baby. However, it is\nalso fairly obvious that he\nworks to fill his time, to\ngive his life some meaning.\n'I enjoy myself when I can do something'.\nEssentially, due to an unlucky coincidence, Kurt\nis responsible for the near\nfatal injury of his son. This\nundermines all that Kurt\nbelieves in and leaves him\nwith the options of ending\nhis life or facing up to it's realities. He chooses to\nlive, and the feelings\nimparted by this act are of\nhope for the future. Kurt\nfinally opens his eyes. 'I can't live an illusion\nanymore'. He leaves his\n'Nest'.\nThe Nest is hampered by\ndesign, the use of a screen\nserves to alienate the\naudience in away that is\nentirely inappropriate.\nRelationships are all\nimportant in theatre and The Nest does not give the\nfeeling that any exist, either\nbetween audience and actors, or actors. Perhaps The Nest would have\noffered greater insight if\nthe approach to it's production had allowed the\nactors space to breath.\nSimon Lewis.\na play that they hope to\nperform at the forthcoming\nwedding festivities. The characters'and their\nsituations introduced, the\nmadness of love's tangled\nweb takes over reeking\nhavoc and despair. This is\nlargely due to the servant\nof The Fairy King who unwittingly, altho ug th without initial remorse,\nuses the magical powers at\nhis disposal to make all the\nwrong people fall in love.\nAfter much upset, and use\nof further slightly different\nmagic, mortals and fairies'\nlove-problems are solved.\nHowever, before all live\nhappily ever after, the\n'actors' perform their play\nto the assembled couples.\nFinally all leave to live their\ncontented existance s but\nperhaps more urgently to\ncons u mate their marriages.\nThe use of dance and movement, flowing and released, in conjunction\nwith music and other 'vocal\nnoise', compels the\naudience not to take their\nattention away from the\naction for a second. The atmospheric lighting of the\nsimple set serves not to\ndetract in anyway from the\ndirection/motivation of the\nactors. Essentially the\nbalance of this production\nis perfect.\nSimon Lewis.\n\n"

Davies\nhas not entirely overcome\nthe difficulties involved and\nsome of the final scenes\nmore closely resemble\nBedroom Farce than\nTheatre of War.\nThe joy of this\nproduction undoubtedly\nlies in the flippant but\nelegant handling of\nShakespeare's text.\nOccasionally the light\nhearted behaviour of the\nactors threatens to mar the\nmore important aspects of\nthe play, but these\nmoments are rare. Clive\nMerrison provides a superb\ninterpretation of Pandarus,\nCressida's eccentric uncle,\nand his flamboyant style\nappears to draw much from\nOsbourne's Entertainer.\nThersites, a deformed and\nscurrilous Greek, is\nbrilliantly transformed by\nAlun Armstrong into a disaffected Northern bigot.\nHis impertinent mimicry of\nthe bone-headed Ajax is\nparticularly memorable.\nThe high standard of\nacting is complemented by\nsome fine production.\nRalph Koltai has designed\na.n elaborate pala cia l vestibule some thirty feet\ntall, which, coupled with\nJeffrey Beecroft's versatile\nlighting comfortably serves\nwar chambers, officer's mess, tavern and courtyard\na like John Burgess\nTroilus And Cressida\ncontinues at the Barbican\non the 4, 5,6th and from the\n11th to the 17th of June.\nFriday 6 June\n\n"
