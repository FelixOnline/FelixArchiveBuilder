    "content": "Felix has a trip to The Synergy\nProject in the age of Aquarius\nTaz Aliabadi explores the fuzzy new world order of fluorescent beards, spinning carousels, inflatable\ninsects, and hoards of hippies in the seven dirt chambers that are SeOne during the Synergy Project\nThe Synergy Project\nSeOne\nFriday 21 January\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nWe were standing on the edge of the\ndancefloor when it began to take\nhold. I remember saying something\nlike \u2018What\u2019s with all the bearded\nhippies?\u2019 None of my companions\nreplied but I thought they\u2019d soon\nnotice that we were deep in hippie\ncountry.\nItallstartedwithanunnecessarily\nlong wait under an arch in London\nBridge. The smell of hair filled\nthe air with dread. Delboy wasn\u2019t\nhelping either, \u2018Pills? K? Charlie?\u2019\nWho is this Charlie-boy? And why is\nhe in such high demand? I would\u2019ve\nasked Del but couldn\u2019t help but be\ndistracted by the spinning carousel\nin the distance.\nMinutes passed \u2013 sixty of them,\nin quick succession. That\u2019s the\nproblem with these hippies \u2013 all\nthat free love gets the better of\nthem and they end up guest-listing\nhalf the fucking city.\nOnce we\u2019d made it through the\nguest-list gauntlet, the first order\nof business was to familiarise\nourselves with this new world order\nof fairies and pixie-dust. I found\nmyself clutching a map and vaguely\nremembered a fluorescent beard,\nor had it just been one of Delboy\u2019s\nlittle helpers? Who knows? Not me,\nthat\u2019s for sure. All I knew was that\nthere were seven dirt chambers\nready for our intrepid exploration.\nSomehow we managed to stumble\nthrough the grinning masses\nand found ourselves bouncing\naround to Fromem-Ory\u2019s hypnotic\npsy-trance.\nThe sounds were hard and\ncrunchy like a bowl of Special K, and\nthe bassline practically knocked\nus to the ground. The room was\nheaving, the atmosphere intense,\nbut the air conditioning was nonexistent and the dancefloor no-smoking. We had to escape and\nmade our way through the maze of\ntunnels by following a midget on a\npogo-stick.\nWe were intrigued by his\npromises of a brave new world,\nand found ourselves in a smaller\nroom; a somewhat calmer place\nbut still retaining the air of potent\npsychedelia. The music was more\nelectronica-based with a hint of\nIDM (no, I didn\u2019t know what the\nfuck it was either but I\u2019m sure you\ncan find a Genre Nazi to fill you in).\nHere, we smoked, we re-hydrated,\nand we tried to chat but despite\nour best efforts (believe me, we\nwere really very keen to chat) we\ncouldn\u2019t make ourselves heard\nabove the pounding beats. We\nstayed for a while; getting to grips\nwith the inflatable insects proved to\nbe trickier than we\u2019d first thought.\nAs we sat there watching the\ncrowds, it became clear (not\nliterally \u2013 by this point, everything\nwas a very unclear fucked-up fuzzy\nmess) that something peculiar had\nhappened to this place and the\npeople that loved it. The endless\ntea served-up in porcelain mugs\nhad been replaced with Malibu and\ncokes, sipped by trendy kids with\nasymmetric haircuts. It was too\nclean and sterile, ever so slightly\nchavved-up and at 20 quid on the\ndoor, not exactly accessible to all.\nIn years gone by, those grimy\narches had been home to some of\nthe most legendary parties seen\nin the late 90s UK rave scene.\nThe Drome, as it was then called,\nwas dingy and filthy and fucking\nwonderful; no room for any kind of\ndoor policy then, let alone daring to\ncharge more than a fiver.\nFor a while there it seemed as\nthough Synergy was successfully\nbreathing new life into a faded and\ndull London club scene, almost\nresurrecting the unique squat\nparty atmosphere created by The\nDrome and The Warp Experience,\nbut somewhere along the way it\nhad lost its charm. Maybe we were\ngetting cynical in our collective\nold age, or it could just have been\nthat intoxicating whiff of something\nunfamiliar in the air. Whatever it\nwas, something had changed.\nIt was at this point that my raving\ncomrades and I realised that we\u2019d\nhad our eyes shut for a significant\nperiod of time; a small crowd had\ngathered and we thought it was\nprobably time to get the fuck up.\nWith a little help from our new\nfriend, Nick, we found our feet. We\nrealised that despite our grievances\nwe\u2019d actually had one hell of a\nnight.\nIf you like the sound of this, then\ncheck out the Synergy Project\nwebsite for details of future events.\nwww.thesynergyproject.org\nTaz Aliabadi\n23\nfelix\nFriday 23 February 2007\nNIGHTLIFE nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOur artists representation of what the couple at the bottom left of this page were seeing at that moment\nThese guys were lapping up the psychedelic trance man\nWin tickets!\nIt takes a certain type of DJ to\nplay all night long.

I will make\nsure you close your windows to\nstop those sexy ladies coming\nin and distracting you from your\nstudies.\nIf I am elected I will hurt you. I\nwill brand you with an iron made\nof pure hatred formed in the fires\nof Mount Doom. Only then will you\nbecome my children \u2013 I will make\nlove to your eyesockets after rendering you blind with a pick-axe.\nIf you vote for me; I will introduce more lesbians into various\nclubs and societies\u2019 committees. I\ndon\u2019t agree with them; but at least\nthey like the flange. I will make\nsure your existence is a constant\nchore by making Felix out of fibre\nglass and puppy dog\u2019s tails. I will\nthen poop in all your amenities\nwhilst singing the Welsh national\nanthem.\nOn a serious note: You can vote\nfor RON if you don\u2019t think any\ncandidate is suitable.

If you want\nthe same again next year, vote for\none of the other people (reverse psy-chology, don\u2019t actually do that).\nI want Felix to be fun and less up-tight, it is a student newspaper at\nthe end of the day.\nMy Felix will be a lot more like it\nwas last year under the legendary\nRupert Neate, i.e. nail-biting excitement and drama from start to finish\n10/10. It will cater for a less narrow\nrange of readers.\nHere are my proposals for next\nyear\u2019s Felix:\n1) Investigative journalism. Apparently nothing happens at Imperial. Fair enough, but those of you\nwho were here last year probably\nremember the Felix editor trespassing in all the halls to expose hall\nsecurity.\nFelix can make news. My Felix is\ngoing to get involved, find out what\nmatters to students and investigate.\n2) More writers. Felix needs up-scaling. I\u2019ll attract a greater range\nof writers to keep more people\ninterested.\n3) Pay rise for Felix editor.\n4) The Oxford English dictionary\ndefines naked as \u201cwithout clothes\u201d.\nWhy are my centrefold models not\nnaked??\n5) Coffee break with Lou and\nAndy\nIn a nutshell, if you elect me as Felix editor I\u2019ll make it a lot more entertaining and light-hearted.\nFelix Sinclair\nFelix has changed dramatically over\nthe last few years. Under Rupert,\nthe news teetered on the tightrope\nof sensationalism, whereas this\nyear\u2019s Felix has maintained a balanced stance and more professional\napproach. However, this has been\nat the expense of some of the light\nhearted content. If elected, I will\nbring the best of both worlds.\nThe comments section will continue with its debate on topical issues\nlike gay adoption and veils, but I will\nbring back Neighbours discussion,\nStormy Woods and other easygoing material. An emphasis will be\nplaced on regularly returning columnists too.\nPage 3 has lost the essence of\nwhat made it so much fun as well.\nI intend to guarantee that women\nand men have an even representation whilst ensuring the photos are\nmore tongue-in-cheek and taken at\nfamiliar college locations.\nI will introduce a global news page\nbriefly summarising the world\u2019s key\nevents as well as a photography\npage. There will also be a greater\npresence at the Freshers\u2019 Fair to\nrecruit more staff and beef out the\ncurrent sections, some of which\nhave only appeared sporadically\nthis year. I will maintain the Felix website and create an informal\nfeedback system so that we can listen to your views.\nFelix has played a major role in my\nlife at university and I\u2019ve loved writing for it. Technically I\u2019ve gained a\nvast amount of experience this year\nas deputy editor. I promise to push\nmyself hard if you elect me and expand upon the good work of the previous editors.\nTom Roberts\nI\u2019ve been writing for Felix since my\nfirst year and have been Arts Editor since 2005, nurturing the Arts\npage into a regular section.\nI\u2019ve developed lots of PR contacts\nand my writers get access to London\u2019s most important Arts events.\nI\u2019m a 4th year mathematician but\nI\u2019ve spent most of my time at Imperial doing lots of other things!\nI sat on the summer ball com-mittee, worked in the Union bar,\nplayed netball and as well as my\nfirst love Felix, I am currently a\nPimlico Volunteer and RCSU Honorary Secretary.\nI will bring Felix out on Thursdays again! Being distributed\non Friday lunchtime as it is now\nmeans that many students don\u2019t\nget a copy until Monday, when the\nnews may well be out of date.\nI want more features and interviews in Felix, and a bigger science\nsection. I plan a \u2018News in Brief\u2019 section with news about student activity in other inferior universities.\nI want Felix to hold Sabbs accountable for their decisions and\npromises, and report on what\nchanges to the Union mean for\nstudents.\nBut it\u2019s not just about news. To\nkeep you entertained in boring lec-tures, I plan to resurrect the legendary FUCWIT league, print more\npuzzles, games and have funnier\ncomment.\nI will be bringing in new ideas\nand contributors to keep Felix\ndynamic and evolving.

I\nfeel a union bookshop on campus is\nessential.\nWith Waterstones closing down\nthere is currently nowhere for students to purchase books specifically\nrelated to their course.\nHave you noticed how there are\ncoffee shops opening up at every\ncorner of Imperial? Are we really the type of establishment that\nwants to be trading books for a double espresso?\nI know that communication with\nstudents is vital, and so all members of the \u2018Slate\u2019 (Messrs. Giannuzzi, Holland, Balikhin and my-self) intend to hold office hours\nwhere time is reserved specifically\nto talk to students about anything.\nOne of the problems I have found\nhas been the lack of student involvement in the running of the\nunion, which I will strive to rectify.\nI would like to encourage all students to feel compelled to raise\nany issues they have with me.\nBeing a student \u2013 and that too, a\nstudent in London \u2013 weighs heavily on the bank balance.\nI am deeply concerned about the\ninflation of accommodation prices,\nand I want to ensure that they reflect the standards of the rooms\navailable with particular attention\nbeing paid to Southside.\nFinally, I stand for all policies stated by other members of\nthe \u2018Slate\u2019.

As the story\nunfolds, drama sets in and tension\nrises high as Louise falls pregnant\nas does Annie again.\nThe play explores a world of bastard boyfriends, lesbian daughters,\nteenage pregnancy, abortion, moth-erhood, careers and \u2018the hill that\nprimroses supposedly grown on\u2019\ncontrasted with a council estate.\nAll six actors were fantastically\nwell cast and most carried out their\nroles with passion and great con-viction, especially Andrew French\nwho took the part of Mathieu, Louise\u2019s ex-boyfriend. The character\nof Mathieu was extremely likeable\nand together French and Michelle\nButterly (Louise) managed to conjure up an amazing chemistry on\nstage. Butterly was highly entertaining in her portrayal of Louise\nespecially during her drunken\nrants about \u2018bastard from now\u2019 and\n\u2018bastard from before\u2019 and injected a\nlot of humour with sexual innuendos aplenty.\nAnnie\u2019s mother Jean (Linda\nBroughton) added highly comical interludes, with her expletives,\nwhich at times became quite heavy\ngoing especially by the end of the\nfirst half. Broughton also brought\nin a musical dimension to the play,\nsinging Cry Me a River.\nThe play inspired lots of thought\nregarding the social issues (moth-erhood, teenagers, sexuality, abor-tion) however I did not leave thinking the playwright had aimed to put\nacross some pseudo-intellectual\nmeaning, and therefore did not dull\nmy enjoyment.\nBy the end of the play I was left\nstunned at the what the play had\nto offer: sensational acting talent,\nloveable characters, plenty of drama to satisfy any soap-lover\u2019s taste,\na myriad of jokes (many crude!) yet\nalso some thinking points without\ndrawing from the play\u2019s entertainment factor. I Like Mine With A\nKiss deserves a lot of praise and\nrecognition.\nCaz Knight\nI Like Mine with a Kiss\nI Like Mine with a Kiss\nBush Theatre\nUntil March 17th\n\u00a37 (Students)\nA cross-dressing epic?\nRamayana\nLyric Theatre\nUntil March 10th\nFrom \u00a37 (Students)\nAlmost anyone of Indian origin\nknows the story of the Ramayana,\nstill celebrated today as the festival\nof Diwali, and David Farr should be\ncommended for trying to bring the\ntale to a new audience in his retelling of the ancient Hindu epic. The\nhero is Rama, a prince banished to\na magical forest with his beautiful\nwife Sita and loyal brother Lakshman. When Sita is kidnapped by\nthe demon Ravana and taken to his\nkingdom, it is up to her distraught\nhusband to rescue her from his\nenemy\u2019s clutches with the help of\nLakshman, the gods, and an army\nof talking monkeys.\nThis play is a reinterpretation for\nthe young and diverse crowds at\nthe Lyric; full of comedy and modern allusions, it makes for great\nentertainment, but waters down\nthe grandeur of the epic. The cast\nis lively, capturing the humour and\nmischief of the monkey troupe and\ntheir hero Hanuman, and Vanessa\nAckerman makes a suitably spunky\nSita. But some of the production\u2019s\nchoices have little more than curiosity value \u2013 I couldn\u2019t really see\nwhat was gained by having the villainous King Ravana played by a\nwoman, although credit should go\nto Eva Magyar for the malign coolness she brings to the role. In fact,\ntoo often Farr gives in to the temptation to make cheap jokes rather\nthan provoke tension, and it is left\nto Shri\u2019s superb music to provide\nthe drama and atmosphere that are\nlacking in the script.\nDespite closely following the plot\nof the original, the production\u2019s\nthemes of materialism and greed\nversus spiritualism and truth feel\nas if they were bolted on to the\nstory, and ring hollow as a conse-quence. Besides its fantastical element \u2013 monkey kings, ten-headed\nmonsters, herbs that bring people\nback to life \u2013 the Ramayana is a\nsophisticated study of humanity,\nwhere love is not always happy ever\nafter, and even heroes are prone to\nenvy and self-doubt. I think that an\ninterpretation that drew out these\nvery modern themes would resonate better with our times than any\namount of cross-dressing. This\nRamayana is certainly enjoyable,\nbut it longs for the depth and emotion to do true justice to an ancient\nstory.\nMeera Ladwa\nWin theatre tickets!\nArts Felix has procured two pairs of tickets to the upcoming production of Vertigo at the Pleasence in Islington, playing 6th-18th March.\nTo win, all you have to do is answer the following question:\nWho directed the 1958 film version of Vertigo?\nAnswers by next Wednesday 6pm to arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPlease include your contact details.\nChamber Concert\nThe concert comprised a selection\nof performances ranging from romantic violins sonatas to themed\nimprovisations using saxophones, a\nvariety of percussion and feed-back\nfrom amps.\nThe concert kicked off with three\nmilitary marches, followed by some\nlovely violin playing from AnneMarie Magnan and an exciting\nimprovisation from Contemporary\nMusic Society. The group used a\nwide variety of extremely interesting looking percussion instruments\nincluding a rain-stick and some\nrattles covered in shells as well as\nmore traditional instruments to\ncreate an intriguing sound-world.\nLater there was a virtuosic performance of Poulenc\u2019s Clarinet Sonata by Stephaine Ramboarina and\nDelphine Feuerstein. The Sonata is\na darkly beautiful work which exploits both instruments to create an\nexquisite palette of sound and was\npeformed with aplomb.\nThe final item was the first movement of a piano quintet by Edward\nElgar. Lead by Lukas Medlam with\npianist Shuang Wang, they provided\nan exciting and impressive ending\nto a thoroughly excellent evening.\nBusking\nYou can miss a concert, you can\navoid artwork, but it\u2019s hard to ignore it when two people are spinning and kicking in front of you on\nthe way to the JCR.\nClad in sexy black-and-yellow and\nsporting posters, flyers and collecting tins, the musicians, dancers and\nmartial artists in ArtsFest busking\nbrought a bit of culture to even the\nmost philistine of scientists.\nActs ranged from individuals to\nsocieties, including Contemporary\nMusic, Gospel Choir, and MTSoc.\nThe martial arts society Capoeira\nattracted a huge amount of attention as they performed on the walkway in front of the SCR (security\nlater spoiled the show). Gypsy jazz\ncame to the SCR in the form of the\nVictoria Watson Trio, and acoustic\npop was provided in the Tanaka\nFoyer by David Paw and friends.\nSpecial mention should go to the\nHilary Woods Quartet, who played\nbeautifully, and to tenor Ed Hughes\nand pianist Gamal Khamis, who\nperformed in a range of venues on\ndifferent days. They also took part\nwith other singers in an informal\nversion of Purcell\u2019s Dido and Aeneas. Yes, an entire opera.\nJazz and Rock Night\nOn Tuesday evening the action\nmoved to dB\u2019s, with and Open Mic\nnight organised by the Jazz and\nRock Society. These sorts of nights\nlend themselves well to the \u201cguy/\ngirl with guitar\u201d singer-songwriter\nstyle, and this was no exception.\nThe beginning of the evening was\ndominated by a series of acoustic\nsingers, playing a range of covers\nand own material. Special mention\nshould go to Pete MacRae and Nick\nRound, whose addition of a violin\nwas an interesting change, and the\nbloke whose name I unfortunately\nmissed, but who deserves much kudos for playing Tenacious D.\nThe acoustic mood was then left\nfar behind as the bands took to the\nstage. Although I admit death metal is not to my taste, Death Penalty\nwere energetic and enthusiastic,\nand seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. The final act was\nthe fantastic Circus Penguin, whose\ninteresting punk-rock-jazz stylings\nand good musicianship was a great\nend to an entertaining night.\nThe Finale\nThis year\u2019s ArtsFest culminated in\na feast of music, dance and martial arts at the Finale concert last\nFriday.\nAs I sat in my seat waiting I was\ndistracted by the hilarious double\nact of comperes Billy Feenan and\nKatie Heskins. The concert opened\na grand collaboration between Sinfonietta, IC and ICSM choirs performing an excerpt from The Mastersingers by Wagner.\nWindband chose a challenging\nset for their ArtsFest debut. This\nwas followed by the music-influ-enced, Brazilian martial art Capoeira. Their spontaneous, acrobatic\nplay fighting was set to traditional\ninstruments.\nICSE provided us with a stunning\nrendition of Barber\u2019s impassioned\nAdagio for Strings which provoked\na tear in the eye and possibly the\nmost enthusiastic applause of the\nnight. The second ArtsFest debu-tants, FuNkoLoGy, gave us a highly\npolished medley of urban styles\nbased on a \u2018Heroes \u2013 good vs. Evil\u2019\ntheme. Not to be upstaged, three\nteams from Dance Company combined ballet, contemporary, jazz,\nand tap styles in one outrageous\nfusion.\nBigBand rounded up the evening\nand, as always, certainly did not fail\nto rouse the audience. Particularly\nimpressive was Jan Marchant on\ntrumpet whose soaring top notes\nwere the icing on a very tasty BigBand cake.\nNot bad for a bunch of scientists,\nengineers & medics. Not only that\nbut around \u00a3400 was raised for the\nNewman Trust too. Culture without\nthe petri dish indeed\u2026\nThe ArtsFest team\nBitesized chunks of ArtsFest trifle\n\n"

    "content": "Helping build bridges in Malawi\nAfter several setbacks at the start\nof the expedition, this determined\nfive-person expedition team from\nImperial College worked tirelessly\nto construct a foot bridge across\nthe North Rukuru River near Uledi in Malawi. Despite cautious\nestimates, the bridge span turned\nout to be greater than anticipated,\nwhich forced major design changes\nand added logistical complications.\nNevertheless, an original conservative schedule along with working\ndawn till dusk seven days a week\nmeant the bridge superstructure\nwas completed within time and on\nbudget. Unfortunately, due to the\ndelivery of steel cable being fraught\nwith delays, the bridge was unable\nto be completed. A return next year\nis envisaged to finish the project.\nThe team was forced to stay in\nLilongwe longer than planned as\nthey waited for their luggage, which\nhad gone astray on their outbound\nflight. Then when travelling north,\nthe team\u2019s progress was halted by\na drunk man who ran out in front\nof their truck. The team assisted\nwhere they could but sadly the\ncasualty died that night from his\ninjuries. The police were informed\nand formalities dealt with before\nthe team could continue.\nMembers of the team met and\ndiscussed plans with senior officials\nfrom the National Park headquar-ters, and with Tommy Mhango, the\nNyika Parks director. These meetings confirmed full government\nsupport for the bridge, which was\nemphasised as vital in order for Uledi to become a fully functional and\neffective anti-poaching scout camp\nduring the rainy season. Some park\nstaff had initial reservations over\nthe community sharing ownership of the bridge. However while\nthere, team members persuaded\nthem this was in their best interest\nin terms of looking after and maintaining the bridge. Senior officials\nagreed, and now the community\nwill have joint ownership status of\nthe bridge with the government.\nThe team went out with a very\nflexible design centred on a suspended type footbridge with masonry towers, concrete anchorage and\na span of up to 30m which, based\non information available, was very\nconservative. However initial surveys revealed only one possible site\nfor the bridge, with a span of 37m\nand flood debris a metre higher\nthan previously thought. Thus major design adaptations were necessary in order to make construction\npossible.\nThe community displayed an obvious enthusiasm for the bridge;\nthis being motivated significantly\nby the prospect of paid work. All\ncommunication with the villagers\nwas done through the four elected\nchiefs of constituent areas, via\nthe National Parks chief resident\nscout at Uledi Camp. Impromptu\nprogress meetings, which were attended by the chiefs, park staff and\nthe team, were held on site when\nissues arose. A total of forty-five\nworkers were employed at local\nrates clocking up some 4800 man-hours between them. Feedback\nfrom those employed was generally\ngood though the work was harder\nthan many had anticipated. This\nresulted in a 25% pay rise to keep\nthem happy. Several workers suffered from minor aches, strains,\ncuts and bruises, with injured\nfeet being the most common. The\nteam ensured all were attended\nto, though other than the cleaning\nof wounds, most of the first aid was\ncarried out more for psychological\nbenefit than by necessity.\nMaterials were sourced locally\nwhere possible and hence the majority of the workforce was employed to extract and carry rocks,\ngravel and sand up or down river\nto the site. Only ten people were\nneeded at any one time for the actual excavation and construction\nwork. Mzuzu was the nearest town\nwhere cement and steel could be\nbought, which involved a three day\nround trip. Three journeys were\nmade due to the volume and weight\nof cement required and the load\ncapacity of our truck. Bricks were\npurchased locally however a track\nhad to be cleared before they could\nbe reached. Seven truck-loads of\nbricks were required to move more\nthan 6000 bricks which were used\nfor the towers. All supplies brought\nin by truck had to be manhandled\nfrom the road end at Uledi Camp\ndown to the site and across the river as necessary.\nTwo 4.4m high mixed masonry-reinforced concrete towers, with\n1m deep foundations were built\ntogether with two anchor blocks\neach made from 6m\u00ac3 of bulk fill\nreinforced cement concrete. The\nfree span between the two towers is 36.7m, with a total superstructure span of some 60m while\nthe height of the towers allows\nfor 1.6m freeboard above highest\nknown flood levels. Also fabricated\nwere the 0.7m wide timber-decking\nunits, made from termite resistant\nblue-gum wood. These are easily\nreplaceable due to their simple de-sign, and since wood was supplied\nfrom the National Parks saw mill at\nChelinda.\nWith the concreting complete,\nit was left to cure and a four day\nround trip was embarked upon to\nLilongwe to collect the steel cables.\nHowever the consignment was still\nstuck in Europe somewhere as all\nfreight had been removed from the\nplane to make room for urgently\nrequired school exam papers.\nWith nothing more to do, the team\ncleared the site, making sure everything was safe and secure, ready\nfor the team\u2019s return in a year\u2019s\ntime to finish the bridge.\nThe team is currently organising this year\u2019s expedition which\nwill complete the construction of\nthe bridge and undertake necessary bank protection work. The\nteam still needs a few more people\nto help them carry out this work in\nMalawi from the 1st July to the 2nd\nAugust 2007. So if you are interested\nin joining the expedition, please get\nin touch immediately \u2013 the team is\nparticularly keen to hear from anyone with a civil engineering background or knowledge. Email daniel.\ncarrivick@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Imperial College Building\nBridges 2006 expedition was only\nmade possible through the support\ngiven initially by Imperial College\nExploration Committee and subsequently by many other individuals,\norganisations, companies and trust\nfunds. The team expresses their\nsincere thanks for all these contributions for without this support\nthe expedition would not have been\npossible.\nIf you would like more information about organising your own\nexpedition please visit www.im-perial.ac.uk/expeditions.

On the one hand, we\nhave a lot of experienced, Unionsavvy folk who know how the place\nworks (and presumably, how it\ndoesn\u2019t work). These are what most\nwould term the \u201chack\u201d candidates.\nOn the other hand, there are a\nnumber of candidates who\u2019ve never been involved with the Union\nbefore, and some who haven\u2019t expressed any interest in it until now.\nThese are the \u201cfresh\u201d candidates.\nThere are pros and cons to both\ngroups. Hacks may be too wrapped\nup the in \u201cpapershuffling\u201d aspect\nof the sabb jobs to figure out what\nwill make a difference to your average apathetic student. On the other\nhand, they have the experience to\ndrop straight into the job.\nFresh-faced types might find the\nlearning curve incredibly steep\non entering the job, and therefore\nachieve absolutely nothing. However, they\u2019re likely to be more in touch\nwith what\u2019s going on in the general\nstudent population.\nAll of these foolish individuals\nwho\u2019ve decided to stand will have\na number of problems to face if\nthey\u2019re elected. These are long-term issues with the Union that\nwon\u2019t be resolved by the end of this\nyear.\nBeit Redevelopment\nThe biggie. The sabbs will have to\nkeep a constant eye on this and its\never-shifting deadlines.\nNUS membership\nGreat, we\u2019re in. Now what the hell\ndo we do with it?\nThe Charities Bill\nDull to the average student; basi-cally, the sabbs have to figure out\nhow the Union can stay independent without making the themselves\noverly personally liable.\nUnion reform\nThe perennial problem \u2013 what do\nwe do to make the Union more efficient and better organised?\nWhat do the sabbaticals do?\nFelix explains why you should take a moment to vote for them\nIf you\u2019re not a hack (and let\u2019s face\nit, most of us aren\u2019t hacks) you\u2019re\nprobably wondering why the hell\nyou should even bother taking a\nfew minutes to log in to the Union\nvoting site and click a few buttons.\n\u201cSabbs?\u201d I hear you cry; \u201cthey don\u2019t\ndo anything except sit on their ars-es and get paid for the privilege!\u201d\nOkay, in some respects you might\nbe correct, but sabbs actually have\na great deal of power. Don\u2019t forget\nthat the full-time staff that work for\nthe Union are often instructed what\nto work on by the sabbs. Sabbs even\nhave the power to change College\npolicy (well, in theory, anyway).\nPresident\nThe head honcho. He or she is the\nboss of all the Deputy Presidents,\nand is pretty much the figurehead\nof the Union.\nIn practical terms, this means\nthey spend a great deal of time in\nmeetings, trying to thrash out policy between all the interested fac-tions. Any time College does something the Union doesn\u2019t like, the\nPresident will have to take control\nand try and sort it out.\nThe character of a President will\nalmost always set the character of\nthe Union the year. You get what\nyou vote for.\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices)\nProbably the most important DP\nposition, since they hold the purse\nstrings for almost every activity the\nUnion dabbles in.\nThey are responsible for all the\nclub budgets, events budgets, and\npretty much anything involving\nmoney you care to name.\nThey are also responsible for the\nbars, including pricing, and general\nbar strategy. Expect to see lots of\nmanifestos promising lower bar\nprices; pretty much every DPFS\nhas promised this.\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties)\nIf you\u2019re in a club (and statistically\nspeaking, it\u2019s likely that you are),\nthen this is your man or woman.\nThis sabb is responsible for the\nday-to-day administration of clubs,\nincluding various wrist-slapping\nactivities. They also tend to be the\nlead organiser for Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nWith more than 200 clubs, this is\na big responsibility. A lazy or bad\nDPCS can spell disaster.\nDeputy President (Education &\nWelfare)\nTraditionally known as the \u201cfluffy\u201d\nsabb, a nomenclature that\u2019s only\nbeen reinforced by the occupation\nof this role by the exceptionally\nfluffy Ben Harris this year.\nThis sabb spends the vast majority of time in meetings with College,\nincluding the big ones like Senate\n(deals with course problems). The\nrest of their time is spent on case-work: dealing with the problems of\nindividual students.\nDeputy President (Graduate\nStudents)\nThe more observant among you\nmight have noticed that there is no\nelection for this position this year.\nThat\u2019s because of the furore surrounding the role; no-one in the Union seems sure whether it is tene-able in the long run, as the last two\noccupants have faced what could be\ncalled intense media scrutiny.\nFelix Editor\nThe odd one out. It\u2019s not like the\nother sabbs \u2013 the President can\u2019t\norder the Editor around.\nThe Felix Editor is (gasp!) responsible for producing Felix. At\nthe moment, it\u2019s one of the only two\nstudent newspapers in London with\na sabb editor.\nThe Felix Editor is also responsible for producing the Freshers\u2019\nHandbook during the summer. If you don\u2019t vote, you can\u2019t complain. It\u2019s the law, y\u2019see\nThe next group of sabbaticals will have to face a number of difficulties. Felix tells you what they are\nThe Union. Beautiful in summer, isn\u2019t it?\n\n"

Like what is the deal with that\ndoor to nowhere they put in the side\nof the Library? It would be great if\nyou could let us all know in Felix!\nGavin Nicholson\nAndy Sykes replies,\nThe large crane is probably for filling in the lightwells that occupy\nspace on level 4 of the Sherfield\nBuilding. Plans are afoot to increase the office space up there,\nand I think the Finance Department have been moved across the\nroad to Princes Gate.\nI have often wondered what the\nhell the \u2018door to the beyond\u2019 was\nin the side of the library. After\nclose consultation with Mr Ashley Brown (Live! editor) we have\ndecided that this door was for\nworkmen so they didn\u2019t have the\ntraipse through the library to get\nto the floor where work was being\ndone. There was a staircase made\nof scaffolding up to it at one point.\nI just hope that should a confused\nstudent who happens to be drunk\non excessive revising doesn\u2019t mistake it for an exit and fall thirty\nfeet to the concrete.\nThe library is getting a new ventilation system (to combat the intense local warming in level 4 and\n5) and a general refurbishment.\nAt least, that was the plan, but\nyou\u2019ll see from the front page that\nthis redevelopment has been thoroughly shafted by Westminster\nCouncil.\nStill upset about\nthe reply to Sam\nFurse\nDear Andy,\nHate to stop you doing your job with\nhaving to deal with minor pedants,\nbut I\u2019m writing regarding the Felix\npage 3 reply to Sam Furse this week.\nYou are quoted as writing that \u2018You\nare not 6\u20194\u201d, tanned and incredibly\nmuscular\u2019 about Mr Furse.\nWell as it so happens, he can probably top those requirements of the\nphysical parameters; he\u2019s 6\u20196\u201d and\nhe\u2019s rather strong (just you try sitting on a horse\u2019s back for atleast an\nhour a week whilst trying to make\nit do tricks and trying not to fall off\n-you probably won\u2019t be able to walk\nthe next day).\nOK, he\u2019s no Arnie, but you did try\nto give an example of what parameters qualify as Adonis. Yes his and\nKat Gray\u2019s page 3 may not have\nbeen to everyone\u2019s taste, and I for\none did not exactly find it something to stick on my wall, but it got\nmore people talking than the regular stock of averagely pretty girls\nin underwear (which admitedly\nprobably got more geeks w**king)\nwhich is the point of the Felix page\n3, is it not?\nI just thought you ought to get\nyour facts right before trying to insult him back.\nAnother thing is - I know you\u2019re\ntrying to cater Felix to it\u2019s \u2018target\nreader group\u2019 with this great surge\nof soft-porn and all (congratula-tions on actually getting a semi-na-ked bloke this week), but honestly,\nare the four pages of \u2018games\u2019 really\nnecessary? Most of the pictures\ncould be reduced in size and you\ncould probably reduce the section\ndown to about two pages.\nFinally, I wonder why you made\n\u2018Collins in X-factor\u2019 a headline story\nwhen the fool who filled in the application form couldn\u2019t even follow\nthe instructions (namely \u2018PLEASE\nCOMPLETE YOUR APPLICATION IN BLOCK CAPITALS\u2019). Perhaps you should run a story in the\nvein of \u2018Collins can\u2019t follow instructions horror\u2019 next week?\nOn positive note, Felix this year\nhas been a bit better designed and\nlaid out, and whoever writes the\nhoroscopes is a comedy genius, so\nwell done on that.\nAvalon de Paravinci\nAndy Sykes replies,\nFor the last time, I wasn\u2019t trying\nto insult Mr Furse. I\u2019m hardly one\nto talk \u2013 I\u2019m 5\u2019 10\u201d, pasty and have\nbeen compared to Skeletor in terms\nof build.\nI shouldn\u2019t have used that phrase,\nas it seems to have been readily\nmisinterpreted. I\u2019ve apologised to\nMr Furse, and I hope there are no\nhard feelings between us. Oh, and\nI saw him in the Union the other\nday, and he is f-ing massive. My\nmistake.\nI think you\u2019re right about Page 3.\nThere was a nicely chiselled bloke\non this week\u2019s, which seemed to\nplease a few ladies. There\u2019s a great\none for next week, but I won\u2019t spoil\nit (it\u2019s more in keeping with the old\nPage 3 style).\nAs for games, a bunch of people\nhave approached me and said it\u2019s\nthe only thing they read, and a few\npeople have said they hate it. There\nare a lot of gameplayers in College,\nand they seem to be enjoying it.\nIt only suffers in comparison\nwith the other sections; seeing as\na few members of Felix are on the\ncampaign trail, and a few have\nhad tragic things happen to them,\nthe arty sections are a bit light.\nHopefully things should improve in\nthe next week or so. The best part\nabout Felix was never the news,\nbut the back part of the paper.\nI won\u2019t name who filled in the application form for fear of making\nthem look bad at an inopportune\ntime.\nAnorexiaMis-represented\nand inaccurate\nSir,\nYour \u201cfashion\u201d editorial Anorexia: a\nmedia problem? made unsubstantiated claims about this serious dis-order. This poorly edited piece sen-sationalized anorexia nervosa and\nmisrepresented the contributing\nroles of the media and the family in\nits development.\nYour author claimed that \u201cAnorexia and obesity are the health\nproblems currently garnering the\nmost attention,\u201d yet she did not\npresent evidence that this is the\ncase. Anecdotally, the \u201csize zero\u201d\ndebate and popular weight-loss diets both loom large in media aimed\nat women, but other disorders are\nalso the focus of newspapers and\njournalism - fertility issues and cancer and its detection and treatment\nas other conditions spring to mind\nas reported about on an ongoing\nbasis; concerns surrounding the\ndetection of the H5N1 virus have\nreceived numerous column inches\nof late.\nMs Skeete\u2019s interpretation of the\nincidence of Eating Disorders and\nbody dissatisfaction in Fiji, and her\npointing to the arrival of television\nas a causal factor, is facile. If two\nfactors change simultaneously this\ndoes not imply a causal relation-ship. It is probable that the arrival\nof television in Fiji coincided with\nother lifestyle changes, any or all of\nwhich could have contributed to the\nreported increase in Eating Disorder symptoms and body dissatisfaction among young Fiji women.\nGiselle\u2019s allegation that \u201cThe\nparents are responsible, not fashion\u201d should be presented together\nwith contrasting evidence that suggests that \u201cbad parenting\u201d does not\n\u201ccause\u201d anorexia. To agree that\nthis is the case perpetuates the\nmyth that anorexia nervosa is a disease caused by the family,and does\nnothing to alleviate the guilt that a\nsufferer\u2019s loved ones may feel when\nthey watch helplessly if the disease\ntakes hold. In some cases, patholo-gies within the family contribute\nto the development of and maintenance of an eating disorder. However, current evidence suggests that\nthere are many contributory factors\nthat are involved and interrelated.\nAnorexia is not \u201cjust a disease,\u201d\nit is a disease - a disorder - a set\nof symptoms with a diagnosis and\nwhilst treatment is complex there\nare treatments and prognoses. It\nis not \u201ca symptom of wider mental\nhealth problems\u201d - it is a mental\nhealth problem.\nRecovery from anorexia nervosa,\nobesity or body dissatisfaction, involves the maintenance of healthy\nbody and mind. This is not easy and\nrequires effort. Attempts to move\ntowards improved health for all\nyoung women is not aided by unrealistic body types on the catwalk.\nNor is it aided by misrepresentation of serious mental health issues\nin Felix.\nAnonymous (by request)\nSarah Skeete (Fashion Editor)\nreplies,\nI think health is a serious issue\nwith respect to fashion, and at the\ntime of writing, the size zero issue\nfeatured prominently in newspa-pers, which is more relevant to\na Fashion page than say fertility\ntreatments or cancer. What I wrote\nreflected my opinion and personal\nexperience, which is to say that I\nthink family plays a part in anorexia in some cases.\nI agree that anorexia nervosa,\nobesity and other eating disorders are serious diseases. I know\nanorexia takes serious effort to\novercome. Having more realistic\nbody shapes on the catwalk might\nhelp in some cases. However as I\nmentioned in my article, there are\nmany reasons why this isn\u2019t going to change drastically anytime\nsoon. Calling for bigger sizes on\nthe catwalk is well and good, but as\nyou said, anorexia is a multi-fac-eted disorder. As I drew attention\nto, the government focusing on\nhealthy eating, and teaching nutrition at schools, is a realistic way to\nhelp target eating disorders.\nI\u2019m sorry if you feel I \u201csensationalised\u201d anorexia, I wrote from my\nexperience and brought up some\npoints that are often lost in an attempt to not offend anyone.\nThe incredible door that leads to absolutely nowhere. What the hell is it for?\n\n"

The NUS\nhas many faults and I am flattered\nthat several members of the Yes\ncampaign agree with me. Since the\nreferendum I have been working constructively with them to ensure that\nthe chances of us reforming the NUS\nare maximised. Imperial has voted to\njoin the NUS by a narrow margin so\nlets make sure they keep their prom-ises. Elect me as delegate and I will:\n\u2022 Vote as Union Council instructs\nme to.\n\u2022 Disrupt the passage of motions\nthat are irrelevant to students as stu-dents.

I\u2019ve been working\nwith the no camp to draw up rules\nfor our conference delegates to ensure that they represent all Imperial students rather than align with\npolitical factions.\nElect me as your delegate and I\npledge to work to keep the conference focused on issues which matter to us as students, to push for\nreforms to realise the full potential\nof the NUS and to work with other\nconference delegates to report back\nto you on our activities.\nAlex Guite\nLast year I was one of many students who campaigned long and\nhard for Imperial to say YES to the\nNUS. As such it should come as no\nsurprise that I passionately believe\nin the need for a strong national\nvoice for students - the voice that\nNUS provides. This year I have already worked with NUS and seen\nthe work it does campaigning for\nstudents\u2019 interests \u2013 not just on top-up fees but I wide range of issues\nfrom housing to healthcare. But I\nhave also seen the problems within\nNUS \u2013 from overstaffing to certain\ngroups constantly trying to talk\nabout issues which don\u2019t affect stu-dents. However, those at the top of\nNUS realise the problems and are\nworking to change the organisa-tion. If elected I will strive to ensure\nthat the much needed reforms are\nimplemented and that NUS continues to fight, and win, for students.\nVote Ben for NUS delegate.\nBen Harris\nI actually campaigned against Imperial joining the NUS. I believed\nthat, on balance, it wasn\u2019t worth our\nmoney. But now we\u2019re in \u2013 narrowly\n\u2013 all ICU members have a duty to\nmake sure the NUS works for us.\nWe need delegates that represent\nthe sceptical middle ground, who\naren\u2019t interested in NUS politics\nand gossip. I\u2019m standing as someone keen to have a conference that\nfocuses on relevant student issues\nlike debt, housing and employment.\nI will seek a frank and open dialogue\nbetween delegates and our Union\nCouncil, to achieve the unity of purpose necessary for ICU to make any\nsort of impact. I hope that the public\nspeaking skills I have developed as\npresident of the debating society\nmight be put to good use in articulating an honest, representative\nvoice for our student body. Let\u2019s go\nto conference with a solid, achievable plan, and make it happen.\nEd Hunt\nI led the No! Campaign last year\npassionately believing that for\nImperial College Union to join\nthe NUS is the wrong thing to\ndo.\nThis is why I am running in\nthis election to become an NUS\ndelegate.\nI want to see for myself first\nhand whether I was right or\nwrong.\nAlso to I want to ensure the rest\nof the delegate team will act as\none representing our students.\nAfter all, our union has paid a\nsubstantial amount of money not\nto the clubs or societies but to\nthe NUS and I will make sure it is\nmoney well spent.\nJames Fok\nAs a campaigner on a range of issues on campus I have seen the\neffects activism can have.\nI am part of the ongoing actions\nagainst top-up fees but I believe\nthat the only way to successfully\nstop fees is to work jointly with\nother universities.\nThat\u2019s why I voted to join the\nNUS.\nBut the NUS needs reform, it\nshould represent the views of ordinary students and be made up\nof activists, not bureaucrats.\nThe government\u2019s neo-liberal\nagenda doesn\u2019t stop at fees. The\nclimate of Islamophobia resulting\nfrom war in the Middle East has\nhit universities hardest.\nResearch at \u201celite\u201d universities\nis being increasingly dictated by\nthe needs of the private sector\nand cuts to public services such\nas the NHS will become more\nof an issue for us especially for\nthe large number of medics at\nImperial.\nCamilla Royle\nImperial needs delegates it can\ntrust.\nCampaigning on all the important student issues must be\ndone with energy and skill.\nAs the Political Philosophy Society President, I have worked\nfor nearly two years in bringing\nprominent speakers to Imperial\nto debate some of the most contentious contemporary issues.\nAs the Politics Editor of Felix, I am actively building\nawareness of the wider global\npicture.\nAs a fifth year medical stu-dent, I have been around a\nlong time, got to know many\ngood people at Imperial, done\nenough time, and got enough\nexperience to know what is going on.\nI believe I am in an excellent\nposition to help you get the representation you need, and keep\nyou informed about the issues\nyou want to know about.\nOmar Hashmi\nHi people, the main issue that\u2019s\ngoing to be hanging over the nus for\nthe next few years will be the top up\nfees. I\u2019m strongly against the top up\nfees and feel that the NUS have not\nas yet done enough to stop it. I also\noppose the war and the subsequent\nattack on civil liberties. While many\nargue that the nus should only concern itself with topics that affect\nstudents directly, I believe that our\nopinions while be taken more seriously if we spent the preceding\nyear involved with the wider issues\naround us, rather than just debating 10% discounts for kit-kats. Having said that, I\u2019d like to add that I\nhave no opinion either way regarding 10% discounts on kit-kats.\nKee Ng\nWhat do these\ndelegates do,\nanyway?\nThe National Union of Students\nis a coalition of student unions\nfrom around the country that\naims to change government\npolicy by acting for all the unions involved.\nThe delegates will attend\nthe NUS National Conference\nin Blackpool, which takes on\nthree days in March.\nThe referendum to decide\nif the Union should affiliate to\nthe NUS said that we would be\njoining.\nAs such, ICU can now send\ndelegates to the NUS National\nConference to debate on what\nNUS policy will be for the next\nyear.\nThings that will be discussed\ninclude top-up fees, student\ndebt, housing issues, and so\non.\nICU Council has decided that\nthe delegates should vote as\nthey are told by Council.

A prize pool of 60,000 euros\ndrew teams from all of Europe to\ncompete in the large field of tourna-ments. Competition stalwart Counter-Strike 1.6 was ever-present,\nas well as Counter-Strike: Source,\nEnemy Territory, Call of Duty 2,\nand the small Battlefield 2 infantry\ntournament. With such a large field\nof competitors, the weekend was\nguaranteed to be exciting for fans\nof team-based shooters.\nA massive 128 teams competed\nfor the over 35,000 euros in the CS\ntournament; this was where most of\nthe action would be, and it definitely\nturned out to be an interesting ride.\nWith Polish World Cyber Games\nwinners Pentagram and Electronic\nSports World Cup winners Made in\nBrazil (mibr) in the tournament,\nit could easily have been nought\nbut a fight between the two. But\nsince Swedish heavyhitters fnatic,\nSK Gaming, and Begrip were all\npresent, a Swedish winner was definitely a possibility. German clans\naTTaX, mousesports, and a-Losers\nwere also in the running, with aT-TaX freshly coming off a victory in\nthe World Series of Video Games fi-nals. Completing the predicted top\n10 were relative underdogs Danish\nNoA, Norwegian Meet Your Makers, and Finnish 69N-28E.\nThe group stages went without\nhitches, but on Saturday, the second day of the tournament, upsets\nbecame fast and frequent. mous-esports quickly took a massive loss\nto mibr and seeds 3 and 10 SK Gaming and mibr were both dropped\ndown by NoA. In the lower bracket,\nSK took another devastating loss\nto Team Logitech to finish a disappointing joint 9th.\nEarly fallers Meet Your Makers\nmade their way through 5 rounds\nin the lower bracket, only to be\nstopped by mibr to finish 5th, while\nBegrip made their way into the\nlower bracket final through a string\nof tiny victories, only to be utterly\ndestroyed by an in-form mibr side,\nwho proceeded to take their revenge on NoA and make it into the\ngrand final.\nThe final, then, was between the\nwinners of the two largest events of\nlast summer, mibr and Pentagram,\nwith mibr needing to take two maps\nto win. On mibr\u2019s best map, Inferno, it looked as if the final would be\nanything but interesting, with mibr\ntaking a convincing 16-7 win. However, going into Nuke, the situation\nlooked a bit more uncertain. Pentagram took an 8-7 victory in the\nfirst half and only needed to take 8\nmore rounds to win it. Starting off\nwell, they went 3 up straight away,\nonly to get completely shut down\nfor 6 rounds by a dominating mibr\nside. With only 3 out of 6 rounds\nneeded for mibr, things started getting close, but Pentagram struggled to the last \u2013 conceding victory\nonly in the very last round of the\nmatch. mibr walk off 16,000 Euro\nricher, with Pentagram raking in a\nrespectable 10,000.\nThe other tournaments went\nlargely according to plan. In Counter-Strike\u2019s prettier (yet not quite\nas popular) twin, Source, winners of\nthe recent EuroCup, Swedish Volt\nGaming were leading opinion polls,\nwith Finnish rivals Team Logitech\nand Insignia Cadre in contention.\nThe group stage went peacefully,\nand coming into the playoffs were\nall the usual suspects. Volt Gaming proceeded to rout all opposi-tion, leaving both Team Logitech\nand aTTaX in their wake. Insignia\nCadre was dropped to the lower\nbracket early, but fought their way\nup to face fellow Finns Team Logitech, in a close game that left Insignia Cadre at 5th place.\nTeam Logitech faced aTTaX in\nthe lower bracket final in a controversial game that saw aTTaX make\nuse of a bug exploit in the penultimate round of the match, leading\nto the German side forfeiting the\ngame and being disqualified from\nthe tournament. Team Logitech\nwent on to face Volt Gaming for the\nsecond time in an anti-climactic\nfinal. Volt Gaming displayed their\nprowess at Source by demolishing\nthe Finns to the tune of 16-5, taking\nhome a well-earned 2600 Euro.\nIn Call of Duty 2, favorites digital-Mind took a group stage victory\nover their main rivals, British side\nDignitas, and slipped into a routine\nof total domination. Dignitas took\na disappointing 5th place, getting\nbeaten after overtime by underdogs suXus, who ended up placing\n3rd overall after defeating Finnish\nTeam Logitech. Dutch team digital-Mind took a convincing victory over\nTek-9 in the Grand Final, having\ngone through the entire tournament without losing a match.\nThe Enemy Territory tournament\nwas a one-horse race throughout,\nHundreds of players and computers turned out, but it was clear before the tournament started which teams would go the farthest. You don\u2019t get anywhere with green scarves\nYou heard the man\nwith former idle.ee representing\nDignitas being the clear favourites by a ridiculous margin. Having\nlost under 10 maps in their last 100\ngames, the only team that had any\nchance at taking home first place\nwas zeroPoint, sporting a lineup of\nplayers from the old Dignitas team.\nBoth teams went through the tournament uncontested, meeting up\nin the upper final for the first time.\nDignitas took a clear victory over\nzeroPoint, who respectively took\na clear victory over third-place favourites Black Magic, coming back\nfor a rematch in the grand final.\nAgain, the Dignitas side did not dis-appoint, and under Night\u2019s leadership took another clear victory.\nFinally, the Battlefield 2 tournament showed a disappointing\nnumber of contestants, with Dignitas\u2019 Battlefield team being tipped to\nwin. After some initial hiccups, the\nteam got their act together, getting\nto the grand final through the upper\nbracket. In the lower bracket, Swedish team Mortifer upset Copenhagen Esports, earning the right to\nface Dignitas in the final. When the\ndust had settled, Dignitas had un-surprisingly walked off with victory.\nshgOpen was an excellent event\nthat had good coverage and was\non schedule throughout \u2013 a feat\nthat any modern gaming event is\nhard-pressed to accomplish. The\ntournament was a great start to the\ngaming season, with qualifiers for\nall the summer events starting in\nthe coming weeks. Here\u2019s to next\nmonth.\n\n"

St Georges picked up\nthe pace and made the defence had\nto work hard, I don\u2019t think Fi has\ndone so much running all season.\nHowever it all went a bit wrong on a\nlong corner and St Georges scored\nan equaliser just before half time.\nThe half time talk was inspirational from Shiv, but the St Georges one\nmust have been better as they came\nout with a vengeance. Something in\nthe IC tactics had gone wrong with\npeople all out of position, however\nthe defence were great in the attempts to stop the opposition. Alice\ndid some fantastic defending on the\nleft and Sheena was great in the\nmiddle coping with their best play-er. However no matter how much\nshouting from the sweeper/goalie/\ncoach mattered as St Georges got a\nbreak and scored another.\nThe last 10 minutes were once\nagain great hockey from IC as play\nwas being so well switched across\nthe back to Ellie and up the right\nto Bella and Dasha who had more\nthan their fair share of the play.\nNo matter how hard IC tried they\njust couldn\u2019t score that equaliser\nand so the final whistle went with\nIC being defeated and not making\nit to the final for the first time in\nyears.\nmanaged to equalise, taking advantage of a dismal five minutes by IC,\nand of Kebab\u2019s first goal \u2013 in the\nwrong end of the pitch!\nDefinitely some fineage for that\non Wednesday.\nLuckily IC struck it lucky and\nscored from a penalty corner at\na strategic point \u2013 just before half\ntime.\nCaptain Moony\u2019s motivational\ntalk did its trick at half time, and\nIC went in to the second half full of\nenergy. LSE never looked like scoring again, and IC finished off by destroying them \u2013 6-2, including a hattrick by Moony. Well played!\nULU Women\u2019s Hockey\nChallenge Cup Quarter Final\nIC 1st XI 6\nLSE 1st XI 2\nULU Women\u2019s Hockey\nReserve Cup Quarter Final\nIC 2nd XI 1\nSt George\u2019s 2nd XI 2\nIC Women\u2019s Hockey \u2013 some stay in, some go out\nThis was a home game for us,\nbut as all 3 boys teams were also\nplaying at home, we played at the\nMedic\u2019s ground in Teddington. The\nref society refused to appoint us a\nreferee on the basis that Middlesex\nhad only turned up with 10 players\nthe week before. This turned out\nto be the case again, but due to so\nmany injuries in our squad at the\nmoment, we were also only capable\nof fielding 10 players.\nSo it worked out well in the end,\nmeaning that neither team had\nto concede and we played for the\npoints. Our coach, John Sykes,\nagreed to referee for us, had it not\nbeen for him we would have been\nlacking a rather important element\nof the game! 10-a-side and uncontested scrums meant that we put\nthe very tiny winger Cheryl in as\nsecond row, allowing us a speedy\npack of forwards.\nThe match went well for us\n\u2013 Courtney scored 5 of our 6 tries,\neach time by breaking through Middlesex\u2019s line of defence and touching down under the posts, and Roxanne served us well by converting\nevery try scored, bumping up the\nscores. Olga scored her virgin try\nfor the team, following an off-load\nfrom Courtney, leading to yet another try between the posts. Notable moments during the match\nwere when Middlesex attempted to\nscore a drop goal, and thought they\nwere successful, only to be reminded by the ref that a drop-goal has to\nbe a drop-kick, not a punt!\nMiddlesex were very fowl-mouthed and swore at the ref a\nnumber of times \u2013 apparently\nnearly every player they had on the\npitch was a qualified ref and \u2018they\nknow all the rules\u2019 which quite\nclearly was not the case, especially\nshown by their attempt at a \u2018drop\u2019\ngoal! The Virgins played very well\nin this match and were very good at\nsupporting each other to allow the\ngame to flow quite smoothly, however we need to work on our ball-handling skills after the number\nof knock-on\u2019s in the game!! Well\nplayed by everyone, and special\nwelcome to Megan who played with\nus for the first time this season.\nWomen\u2019s Rugby\nUCL 51\nICUWRFC 5\nWell an interesting and somewhat\ndifferent game this certainly was! I\nmyself was very much looking forward to this day, after being given\nthe all-clear by doctors to play again\nfollowing hand surgery back in December. UCL remain unbeaten in\nBUSA and unfortunately, try as we\nmight, we were unable to change\nthis. The game started off well,\nwith both sides looking relatively\nwell-matched.\nWithin the first 20 minutes, 3 tries\nhad been scored, 2 for UCL and 1 for\nus. No conversions left the score at\n10-5 and gave the Virgins hope that\nmaybe this could be pulled out of\nthe hat. As the whistle blew for\nhalf time, the score was 22-5 but\nall was by no means lost. The second half of the game started with\nour kick, and we hit back at them\nhard. Within 5 minutes however,\nfull back Jess was on the ground in\npain, complaining of neck/ shoulder\npain. The medics of the team took\ncharge (Serena and Bonnie in par-ticular) and decided not to take any\nchances with pain in this area and\ncalled for an ambulance.\nIt took half an hour for the paramedics to sort Jess out and take\nher off to hospital, which left both\nteams starting to cool off and anxious to finish the game. At the whistle to re-start, the Virgins had lost\nspirit and found it very difficult to\nget back into the game. This lead\nto a succession of tries being run in\nby UCL, with a series of successful\nconversions.\nI have to say how well we managed to pull it back together and enjoy the last 10 minutes of the game\nto finish on a high, knowing we had\nfought back after everything that\nhad happened.\nTwo more players spent the\nevening in A&E: myself, after re-breaking my finger, and Lucy with\na potential concussion. However,\nall players are on the mend with no\nserious outcomes. All in all not the\nbest of games but experience none\nthe less!\nJack Cornish\nThe tug-o-war match suddenly went wildly out of control\nYou, my dear, whoever you are have absolutely splendid legs and if I look hard enough whilst tilting my head, I can just see up your skirt\n\n"

    "content": "Change today, choose Fairtrade!\nThis year is the first year that the\nImperial College Fairtrade Society\nhas been officially recognised by\nImperial College Union after receiving the Student Campaign Group of\nthe Year Award last year from the\nUniversity of London Union.\nAs a result the drive for Fairtrade has really stepped up on\ncampus with College Catering\nleading the way to a remarkable\nchange-around.\nBack in 2004, when the Fairtrade\nUniversity policy was passed at\nUnion Council, we were still in a\nposition which lacked the College\u2019s\nbacking and needed lobbying of college catering to support the Student Union in their commitment to\nFairtrade.\nNow the opposite is true, with\nCollege publicly stating its commitment to becoming a Fairtrade\nInstitution and actively sourcing\nmore and more Fairtrade Alternatives whilst the Union falls by the\nwayside.\nThis policy is currently under review and will be presented to Union\nCouncil on 1st March, to coincide\nwith Fairtrade Fortnight. Anybody\nwith an interest in Fairtrade is welcome to come along to support the\npaper.\nFairtrade Fortnight is an annual\nevent endorsed by the Fairtrade\nFoundation. The events, held in\nthousands of universities, towns,\nschools and places of worship in\nthe UK and Ireland, aim to raise\nthe awareness of Fairtrade Products and the benefits they bring to\ntheir producers throughout the entire world.\nIt is an opportunity for people\nwho are unaware of the movement,\nor sceptical of its achievements, to\nfind out more about how Fairtrade\nworks and operates.\nThis year\u2019s theme is \u2018Change to-day, Choose Fairtrade\u2019 and with the\nwide variety of products on offer,\nit really never has been easier to\nchoose Fairtrade.\nAs a forerunner in scientific research I believe that Imperial College has a responsibility to promote\nmatters of social and environmental responsibility to its students.\nPresenting our students with a\nclear message on ethical and environmental standards will influence\nImperial Graduates to expect these\nstandards in the work place and on\nthe wider global market.\nBecoming a Fairtrade University\nwill increase the reputation of Imperial College and make the institution more appealing to prospective\nstudents and staff alike.\nThe objectives that we must meet\nto be awarded this status will also\nresult in increased choice across\ncampus with a wider range of products on offer alongside those which\nare Fairtrade Certified.\nToo often people\u2019s knowledge of\nFairtrade extends no further than\nthe mundane cup of coffee and the\nstereotypical banana.\nThis Fairtrade Fortnight I have\ntried to put an emphasis on the\nwide range of products available\nwhich step beyond your standard\nconsumables.\nThere will be an opportunity to\nhear first hand how Fairtrade has\nhelped two coffee growers from\nNigeria; a chance to kick around\na Fairtrade Football and even\nfair trade knickers on sale at our\nbazaar!\nI hope that this serves as an insight into the scope of this rapidly\nexpanding business initiative and\nbrings Fairtrade right into the\nspotlight.\nThere really is something for eve-ryone.

    "content": "Halo 2 multiplayer \u2013 the guide\nAzfarul Islam is here to kick ass and chew bubblegum. He\u2019s fresh out of one of them, and it\u2019s not ass.\nM\nuch to chagrin of\nthe burgeoning\npopulation of fan-boys, allow me to\nstart off with my\npersonal shock-and-awe campaign:\nHalo 2 is ludicrously overrated.\nThe single player campaign, at\nleast. Let\u2019s say that the story is\ndisappointing with some poorly\njudged pacing near the end. In fact,\nthe main campaign is quite forgettable after an initial play-through in\nCo-Op. Despite being an extremely\npolished game overall, it lacks any\nparticularly stand-out attribute\nthat might thrust it into the upper\nechelons of gaming.\nAll but one \u2026 the multiplayer.\nCombining and subtly balancing\nthe brisk pace and sheer insanity of\nUnreal with the tactical stratagems\nand team camaraderie inherent in\nCounter-Strike, Halo 2 stands as\none of the finest multiplayer games\nin existence.\nOne of the key attributes that\nmakes the multiplayer in Halo 2 so\nbrilliant is that it\u2019s extremely intuitive and playable like no other. Coupled with a refined control scheme\nthat allows most gamers to adjust\nwithin a matter of moments, this\nis one of the few games that you\ncan unashamedly bust out at a\nparty and get most people intensely\ninvolved.\nThe life system uses a shield-based mechanism; there are no\nhealth pick-ups. Initially, all damage is borne by your energy shield\n\u2013 once that\u2019s depleted, you\u2019re reduced to a sack of flesh that\u2019ll die\nafter being pumped with a few bul-lets. However, the shield regenerates over time, particularly when\nyou\u2019re immobile. This allows you\nto strategically retreat and rejoin\nthe fray with gusto. This ingenious\nfeature allows for an ever-shifting\nvie for supremacy and allows the\nfun to continue as long as you can\nhold out.\nThe weapons are ingeniously designed and it\u2019s quite obvious that\neach one was laboriously customized to be unique. Since there are\na few basic types, the fact that you\ncan only carry two weapons on your\nperson creates a real need to find\nyour own niche.\nHalo 2 also allows you to use a\nvariety of vehicles, some unique\nto particular levels. Each one has\nbeen carefully crafted to offer ease-of-use \u2013 and significant mauling\ncapabilities. It\u2019s possible for dexterous players to eject the opposing\noccupant of a vehicle (get up close\nand use X) thereby coming into\nownership, however temporary, of\nsaid means of transport. The bloodbath ensues again.\nIt\u2019s also quite clear that much\nlove was put into each level since\nthe majority boast fantastic design\nsensibilities and architecture that\nmaximises the gratification gamers\nwill receive.\nHalo 2 is indeed the ultimate multiplayer game \u2026 in my opinion,\npitchfork-wielders and CS zealots\ntake note.\nWith my unabashed arse-kissing\ncomplete, let me properly introduce\nyou to The Guide to Halo 2 Multiplayer. Note that this applies to of-fline, split-screen multiplayer only.\nFor online games on Live! many of\npoints brought up are equally appli-cable, but some aren\u2019t.\nLike most games of the multiplayer ilk, Halo 2 offers your basic\ngameplay variations such as Slayer\n(Free-for-all Deathmatch), Team\nSlayer (Team Deathmatch), Capture the Flag (Self-explanatory),\nAssault (Take bomb, plant bomb\nin enemy base, run away screaming like girls) and Territories (Hold\nonto your own land while evicting\nyour opponent off theirs). There\nare other slightly newer types such\nas Oddball (hold onto a skull and\nsurvive \u2013 talk about ominous) and\nJuggernaut (If you\u2019re the Juggernaut only you can score; whoever\nkills you becomes the Juggernaut).\nEach of these modes have quite a\nfew integrated variants of their own\ncentring around specific weapons\nor modified stats. Fortunately, the\ngame allows a well-proportioned\ndegree of flexibility when creating\ncustom game modes or even editing the built-in types.\nA common moot point for Halo 2\nis bots (AI controlled opponents), or\nlack thereof. When you have enough\npeople around, it\u2019s quite trivial but\nwhen there are only two or an odd\nnumber of gamers, their absence is\nsorely felt.\nLike most RPGs, Halo 2 offers\nyou the ability of customising your\navatar. Of course that\u2019s not saying\nmuch when you\u2019re just a guy in a\ntin suit \u2026 high-tech or otherwise.\nBesides the Spartan class (the type\nof soldier that the protagonist, the\nMaster Chief, is) you can select\nbeing a Covenant Elite (alien bad-guys; ugly). There aren\u2019t any particular advantages to either besides\na personal cosmetic preference.\nHowever, after extensive play you\nmay find that the Elites are more\ndifficult to get a bead on with a sniper rifle due to the sunken anatomy\nof their heads. Plus, they look great\nin Pink, which is more than can be\nsaid for Master Chief.\nHead on over the page for an in-depth look at Halo 2\u2019s finer points.\nHalo 2 controls \u2013 the basics\n30 felix Friday 23 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Boom, headshot! Highlights from Halo\u2019s arsenal\nMagnum: Unlike the first Halo,\nthe Magnum has been toned down\nto a discreet side-arm. You must\ndepress the trigger repeatedly for\neach shot. By itself, it\u2019s a rather\nuseless weapon unless your foes\u2019\nshields are down. When coupled\nwith an SMG or Plasma Rifle/Pistol,\nthis becomes rather deadly again.\nSubmachine gun (SMG): A basic\nSMG with a fast rate of fire that\u2019s\nideal for use in close- and mid-range combat. One disadvantage is\nthat the clips tend to empty rather\nquickly and there\u2019s a significant recoil that invariably causes you to\nslowly start aiming skywards. Dualwielded, these are formidable.\nBattle-Rifle: A weapon that marries the rate of fire of the SMG with\nthe range and scope of the sniper\nrifle. A Battle-Rifle is deadly in mid-and long-range skirmishes; an accurate player can down foes from\nhuge distances. Since it fires in\nbursts, the recoil is less pronounced\nthan that of the SMG. At close-range, however, this is a foolish op-tion, unless wielded with care.\nShotgun: The ultimate weapon\nfor close-quarters combat. A single headshot spells instant death\nfor foes (and friends alike, for the\ntrigger-happy). The sound is par-Full circle \u2013 mastering Halo 2 MP in ten steps\nThe Plasma Sword \u2013 Putting the \u201cAce!\u201d into \u201cGod, no, not the face\u201d\nHere\u2019s a quick run through on\nhow to be the master, er \u2026 Master\nChief. Sorry about that one, enjoy\nanyway:\n1. You may find it advantageous\nto change the look sensitivity in the\noptions menu. A slower degree of\nsensitivity is good for players who\ntend to rush others or shoot locally;\nfaster levels are a must for skilful\nstrafers.\n2. I cannot stress enough the importance of experimenting to find a\nweapon configuration that plays to\nyour strengths. If you prefer to be\nin the midst of all the action, then\nclose-quarters weaponry such as\nthe Plasma Sword and Shotgun are\nimperative, coupled with an SMG.\nAt range, the Battle-Rifle or either\nsniper rifles can turn you into a god.\nTry mixing and matching various\nSpartan and Covenant weapons to\nform part of your arsenal.\n3. Learn to use each grenade\ntype to its strength. The frags will\nbounce a bit before exploding, allowing you to set up kill-zones with\ngood aiming. You can bounce them\naround corners or into sniper hides\nfor maximum effect. Plasma grenades are adhesive and will stick to\nboth players and vehicles. You can\nturn your opponents into suicide\nbombers or make up for the lack of\na bazooka when against a vehicle.\n4. Teamwork is absolutely essential in matches. Being able to coordinate attacks and offer support\nto your partner will truly bridge the\ngap between a loss and victory. It\u2019s\nimperative to communicate plans\nto your comrade otherwise you\ncould end up in embarrassing collateral damage (i.e.\nteam kill) situations. It\u2019s\nan ideal combination\nwhen at least one of\nyouisadecentsniper\n\u2013 if not, at least one\nshould endeavour\nto take the place of\na sharpshooter with\nthe other watching\nyour back.\n5. The lock-on\ncapabilities of the\nPlasma Sword offer\na bit more strategy\nthan you\u2019ll realise.\nticularly satisfying. Interestingly,\nit\u2019s possible to pull off a shot in the\nmidst of reloading \u2013 however, you\nhave to had inserted atleast one\nshell. You\u2019ll also find that despite\nbeing a rather in-your-face weapon\nit can still chip away at range, too.\nSniper-rifle: One of most popular\nweapons in multiplayer gaming,\nthis can be one of the deadliest too.\nSkilful (or lucky) players may even\nbe able to line up headshots without\na scope. The range is in two levels of\nzoom: 5x and 10x (click in the right\nstick to switch between them). At\nlong-range, single headshots are all\nit takes to bring down opponents.\nHowever, when your scope is in use\nyou can\u2019t see your motion sensor\nor your surroundings and sneakier\nplayers will love to creep behind\nyou, wait to rub it in and then melee you to death. At close- and mid-range, you might as well stand still\nand die quickly.\nBazooka: One of the nastiest surprises you can give to anyone in\nHalo 2. This is a weapon that can be\nused to level the playing field when\nthe other team keeps \u2018splattering\u2019\nyou with a Covenant Ghost. The\nbazooka boasts significant splash\ndamage and is particularly useful\nwhen the other team is grouped\ntogether \u2013 preferably in a tight cor-ner. The bazooka can lock onto en-emy-occupied vehicles with some\ntrigger-stroking. One disadvantage\nis the ammo is extremely limited;\nhowever, this is a weapon that is potent at all ranges and can swing a\nbattle your way.\nPlasma Pistol: Not exactly\nequivalent to the Magnum, this little weapon fires out small spuds\nof plasma that nibble away at your\nshield. Useless unless you charge\nit up \u2013 when that happens, you unleash a crackling ball of pure energy that depletes your opponent\u2019s\nshields to nil. Slaughter as you see\nfit.\nPlasma Rifle: A lot more potent\nthan the SMG, the plasma rifle has\na higher rate of fire as well but that\u2019s\noffset by the fact that it overheats.\nWhen that happens, the weapon\njams and you\u2019re a sitting duck.\nCovenant Carbine: Often eschewed for the superior Battle Rifle, this rifle is quite the weapon. It\u2019s\nfaster than the BR and is equally\ncapable. However, the ammo capacity is limited and not as precise.\nIn the hands of skilled players, this\nis still deadly.\nPlasma Sword: A truly nasty\npiece of work depending on who\u2019s\nwielding it. It locks on from range\n(wait for a telltale red crosshair)\nand allows you to charge for a single kill in a very anime-esque way.\nIn large maps, it needs tactics. In\nsmall maps, go wild with it.\nCovenant Needler: Like a porcupine rifle, it fires pink crystals that\nadhere to the body and explode\nwithin seconds. It can actually lock\nonto energy sources like the shield\nand slowly bring it down. If you\ndual-wield Needlers, you can rapidly kill.\nPlasma Grenade: While it doesn\u2019t\nbounce around, it does stick to vehicles and more sadistically, people.\nIt has its strategic uses in that a\nstick guarantees a kill, for vehicles\nas well. Being able to stick someone\naccurately will make you a force to\nbe reckoned with.\nIf your foe is above or below you\nand the sword locks on, you\u2019ll actually fly towards him, defying all laws\nof physics in the process. You\u2019ll find\nspecific levels where this comes in\nvery handy.\n6. When armed with a Plasma\nSword or Rocket-launcher do\nnot equip either as your primary\nweapon if in the open. The\nPlasma Sword is an\ninviting beacon\nto snipers even\nif you\u2019re invis-ible, whereas\nthe Rocketlauncher\nobscures\none-third\nof your\nvi-sion. Also, it\u2019s a lot more gratifying\nwhen your enemies blindly rush you\nonly to find you whipping out the\nsword for death by impalement.\n7. I may sound rather daft, but\nchoosing the right colour in Team\nSlayer has more benefits than is\nimmediately obvious.\nRed, orange, and brown make it\nharder to see you in earthy maps\nwhereas blue and green work well\nin the shade and urban areas. Camouflage is particularly useful for\nand against snipers.\n8. Try playing with a handicap on\nto really improve your skills and\ngenerally hold bragging rights.\nEven if you lose, you could still\nsay you were handicapped; it\u2019s a\nwin-win situation. A handicap will\ndecrease your life bar, the damage\nyour weapons do as well as increasing the time taken for your shield to\nregenerate.\n9. If you screen-watch, you suck\nand should be b[efriended].\n10. Have fun and don\u2019t get upset\nwhen you lose. Good sportsmanship is the key to getting the most\nout of multiplayer.\n31\nfelix\nFriday 23 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

This was the first study of\nits kind.

Colette Marshall, UK director of charity Save the Children,\nsaid the report was a \u201cshameful\u201d\nverdict on Britain. She said \u201cdrastic\naction,\u201d including an injection of 4.5\nbillion pounds, was needed to meet\na government target of halving the\nnumber of children in poverty by\n2010.\nIn medical psychiatry, there has\nbeen much discussion about childhood unhappiness. S Timimi S in\na paper entitled \u201cRethinking childhood depression\u201d says tot her effect\nthat to diagnose major depression\nin children is to medicalise the unhappiness caused by affluence, per-missiveness, a decaying family and\nsociety.\nHowever, Joseph M Rey and\nMichael J Dudley contrast this view\nin a number of articles entitled \u201cDepressed youth, suicidality and antidepressants\u201d, by stating that medical practitioners and governments\nFlu, flu, all over the world and spreading...\nhave been told during the last\nquarter century that depression is\na serious illness that can lead to\nsuicide, poor physical health, and\npersonal, professional and social\ndifficulties. Thus, the international\nmental health community has invested considerable resources in\ntrying to tackle this scourge.\nUnfortunately, some of the problems when dealing with a ranking\nsystem is that it is simply a form\nof relative ranking. Overall, teenagers might be adversely affecting\nthe results by being more vocal\n(yes I mean moaning) about their\nailments, relationship problems or\nlife\u2019s work.\nIt does not necessitate that they\nare objectively worse off, rather\nthey just perceive to be, and further,\nwe cannot objectively tell in units\nof happiness how much more unhappy they really are. Perhaps unhappiness can be in certain cases a\ncourse for drive?\nAfter all of this discusion, home\norganisations and governemnt do\nneed to monitor the situation fur-ther, and with a higher degree of sophistication in order to objectively\ndiscern how happiness is felt as,\nopposed to how much better off that\nparticular individual is. As this survey is the first of its kind, I presume\nit will be quite some more time until\na more refined conclusion is built.\nIf expert clinicians disagree, it\nis little wonder that the public is\nconfused, yet severely depressed\nteenagers will continue to come to\ndoctors for management.\nCamilla Royle\nJust how do you measure who is happier?\nOmar Hashmi\nPolitics Editor\n4 felix Friday 23 February 2007\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLi Teck Lau\nH5N1 avian influenza finally struck England last month in Holton in sleepy Suffolk\nI\nknow that the constant and\nrepetitive feeling of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nis getting to you know, but it\nshould. We are going to see\na lot happen in the next few\nmonths.\nAll I can say is that it is in the\nAmerican government\u2019s best interests to keep Iran neutralised. The\npressure is mounting. Plans for a\nmassive military strike have been\nunveiled, and President Ahmadinejad is in the lowest diplomatic position he has ever been in before.\nCriticism of his foreign policy rhetoric (concerning Israel as well as\nUranium) and his poor record on\npromised reforms at home have\nbeen the primary objections. As a\nresult, 150 members of the parliament signed a letter blaming him\nfor raging inflation, soaring food\nprices, high unemployment, and\nfailure to deliver a budget on time.\nThis with an overwhelming defeat\nin December\u2019s local elections, ultimately means that that power has\nshifted over to the pragmatists.\nThis shift may (or may not) bring\npeace - but what is teh price to the\nIranian people of this move?

Avian flu is a mild\ndisease, often not life threatening\nin wild birds.\nHowever, H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain, and according to the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO),\nmay claim up to 100% of contaminated animals within 48 hours, affecting respiratory tracts, organs\nand tissue.\nThat it is a highly contagious\ndisease, and that birds reared for\nthe food industry are kept in such\nconfined environments, presents a\nhuge risk to agriculture and any nation\u2019s economy.\nAfter the French outbreak in February 2006, poultry sales plunged\nby 30%, and only recovered half a\nyear later. Chickens are the main\na contaminated animal; poultry\nraised to a heat above 70 degrees,\nand strict hand washing practices.\nIt is, however, the practice of home\nslaughter, common in many developing countries, which significantly\nincreases risk of infection.\nThere has been much investigation into any human cases because\nmany scientists fear a mutated version of the virus, one that spreads\njust as fast between humans and is\nequivalently fatal, will bring about a\nnew pandemic. Influenza pandemics have so far been periodic in human history, with the worst case\noccurring in 1918 with the \u2018Spanish\nInfluenza\u2019.

Our\nrepertoire includes a wide range of\nstyles from traditional English folk\nmusic, to modern film scores \u2013 including Jurassic Park, James Bond\nand Star Wars \u2013 to suites from West\nEnd musicals, with just about everything in between!\nFor the last three years we have\nhad the pleasure of being conducted by Gilly French. Gilly is an\nacclaimed conductor and joint artistic director of Bampton Classical Opera, a small company with a\nnational reputation for its revivals\nof rarely-heard eighteenth century\nopera.\nThe band usually has two end-of-term concerts a year, at Christmas\nand Easter, one particularly memorable concert being an impromptu\noutdoor concert performed beneath the Queen\u2019s Tower on a cold\nDecember lunchtime!\nThis term has seen Imperial College Winds playing in our first concert outside Imperial. The band\ntravelled to Bampton in Oxfordshire, the home town of our conduc-tor, for a fund-raising concert in St\nMary\u2019s church, which raised over\n\u00a3600 for reparations to the church\nroof. The concert was a great success with the hugely appreciative\naudience filling the entire church\ngiving a real buzz to the evening.\nThe programme featured an eclectic selection of pieces, including\nSymphonic Marches by John Williams, Second Suite for Wind Band\nby Gustav Holst and the band\u2019s current favourite film score Chicken\nRun by Powell/Gregson-Williams.\nThe concert has since been the\ntalk-of-the-town amongst the local\npeople in Bampton and the band is\ninvited back next year to perform\nagain. The band greatly enjoyed\nperforming in a new venue and\nwere given such excellent hospital-ity, so will look forward to a return\nvisit next year!\nImperial College Winds has been\nthe catalyst for the formation of two\nnew groups at Imperial College \u2013 a\nclarinet quartet and a flute quartet\n\u2013 both of these quartets performed\nat St Mary\u2019s church playing two\ncontrasting pieces.

The plans included a\nnumber of changes to improve the\npoor ventilation in the building.\nThese include extra vents and motorised windows to provide fresh,\ncooler air into the building.\nThese were to complement the\nplanned \u201csolar shading\u201d, which\nwould be achieved by dimming the\nLibrary\u2019s windows. This should\ncomplement the otherwise poor\nair conditioning and the extra\nventilation to reduce the ambient\ntemperature.\nWestminster Council rejected\nthe planning application outright,\nmeaning none of the works can go\nahead. It seems the main objection\nto the plans was a dissatisfaction\nwith the change of appearance that\nwould be caused by the solar chang-es. This is somewhat odd, as the Library is almost completely invisible\nfrom the outside of the campus, so\nany change should have minimal\nimpact on the surrounding area.\nTemperatures in the Library\nhave been a problem for the last\nfour years; it seems the air conditioning system cannot cope with\nthe large number of students and\nhigh air temperatures around the\nsummer revision period. The large\nwindows in the upper levels also\ncreate a \u201cgreenhouse-like\u201d effect\nthat makes the Library unpleasant\non sunny days.\nThe planning application is due\nto be resubmitted without the solar\nshading proposal, but it is highly\nunlikely the other planned improv-ments will prove sufficient to solve\nthe Library\u2019s overheating problem.\nThe rejection should only slightly\ndelay these other changes.\nThe College and Union are looking for support from local residents\nfor the shading, and are contacting\nthe councillors known to be friendly\nto the College.\nIf you live in the borough, Felix\nadvises you to write to your local\ncouncillors (you can find their details on www.westminster.gov.uk) to\nexpress your disapproval.\nBlaze at Albert\nHall Mansions\nAt 10.30am on Tuesday morning, smoke was spotted coming from\nthe top of the Albert Hall Mansions building (to the east of Beit\nQuad).

Up until now we have followed this plan almost to the letter.\nHowever, a debate has recently reopened over one element of a future\nphase we hope to implement in 2008. Our existing plans to convert\nthe current Union o\ufb03ces on the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor of the Beit Building in to\na caf\u00e9 is being widely discussed and an alternative plan to turn this\narea of the building into \ufb02exible clubs and society space is being\ndeveloped. We are keen to \ufb01nd out whether students think the east\nside of the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor of the Union building should be used either as a\ncommercial venue or as a dedicated facility for clubs and societies.\nA petition in favour of the club space option is currently being\nprepared for consideration by the Union Council and if you wish to\n\ufb01nd out more about these proposals or even sign the petition then\nplease contact the RCC Chair, Mark Flower by emailing\nrcc.chair@imperial.ac.uk.\nShould the Union reform the DPGS sabbatical position?\nThe Deputy President for Graduate Students (DPGS) position has rarely\nbeen out of the spotlight in its short life. The holder of this position is\ntasked with two very di\ufb00erent roles; the \ufb01rst is to act as an ICU Deputy\nPresident and the second is to run the Graduate Students\u02bc Association\n(GSA). The consensus seems to be that the second role is working well\nbut the \ufb01rst is not and this is why three proposals to change this role\nhave been developed and discussed in recent weeks. These models\nare:\n\u2022 Retain the sabbatical role but remove the Deputy President element\nfrom it to create a new post called GSA President.\n\u2022 Abolish the full time sabbatical role and replace it with unpaid\nvolunteer o\ufb03cers who would be led by a part-time GSA President and\nsupported by a part time professional sta\ufb00 member.\n\u2022 Abolish the full time sabbatical role and replace it with unpaid\nvolunteer o\ufb03cers who would be led by a volunteer GSA President and\nsupported by a full time professional sta\ufb00 member.\nIf you want to know more about these proposals and want to tell us\nwhich one you prefer then please contact our present DPGS, Shama\nRahman, by emailing to\ndpgs@imperial.ac.uk.\nShould the Union introduce a\nviable environmental policy?\nLast but certainly not least, and\naptly following a highly successful\nGreen Week, the Union is seriously\nconsidering introducing a powerful\nnew Environmental Policy that will\ncall for:\n\u2022 A reduction in Union waste through\nreducing use of disposable ski\ufb00s,\ncrockery and cutlery.\n\u2022 Better provision of recycling\nfacilities in the Union building.\n\u2022 A greener Beit Building Masterplan that includes secondary glazing,\ninsulation and low energy lighting in the Beit building.\n\u2022 The creation of a new transport policy that encourages clubs and\nsocieties to use greener forms of travel.\n\u2022 A campaign to encourage the College to buy electricity from\nrenewable sources.\nAgain, a petition is being prepared in support of this policy and if you\nare interested in signing it then please email Hannah Theodorou at\nhannah.theodorou@imperial.ac.uk.\nTime for change? You tell us.\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nGet your voice heard!\nAnd win amazon.co.uk vouchers\nfor doing it\u2026\nAs a student it can be massively frustrating;\nhowever hard you shout kick or scream\nyou just can\u02bct get anybody to listen. Simply\ngetting your lecturer to write slightly slower\ncan take months of delicate negotiations,\nwhile changing your personal details\nresembles a crusade against bureaucracy\nrather than a simple administrative task.\nHowever, right now there is a once in a\nlifetime opportunity to get your views\nacross in not one, but two surveys.\nThe \ufb01rst is the National Student Survey (NSS) which can be found\nat www.thestudentsurvey.com. This is a nationwide survey which\nis open to all \ufb01nal year undergraduates across the UK, and covers\nall aspects of the university experience. This is a public survey and\nas such is the best opportunity you have of letting people outside\ncollege \u2013 be it the press or prospective students \u2013 know exactly what\nyou think. In previous years the College has performed well in most\nareas, but is that still true? Of course in some areas, like feedback\nfrom assessments, the College has been slated by students, and\nthat\u02bcs helped spur them into taking action on the way coursework\nmarks are delivered \u2013 proof that what you say makes a di\ufb00erence.\nIn a big change this year College, at the request of the Union, hasn\u02bct\ngiven out your phone numbers. This means you won\u02bct be pestered\nconstantly while trying to revise, but it also means it\u02bcs up to you to\ntake part. We need 50% of all \ufb01nal year students to respond, and if\nyou don\u02bct\u02bc then College will have to look again at whether or not it\nprovides numbers. So for the sake of those in lower years please,\nplease \ufb01ll it in.\nLooking closer to home the College and the Union are working\ntogether to look at how we deliver online services and how they can\nbe improved. As part of this we\u02bcve been consulting departments\nand groups of students across College, but we want everyone to\nhave their say. And this is where you get to win amazon.co.uk\nvouchers.\nWe\u02bcve launched an online survey which you can \ufb01nd at\nunion.ic.ac.uk/survey, to \ufb01nd out what you think of the services\no\ufb00ered,andwhatadditionalservicesyouthinkshouldbeintroduced.\nEveryone who takes part can enter the prize daw to win either a \ufb01rst\nprize of a \u00a350 voucher, or two runners up prizes of \u00a325.\nThis survey forms part of a wider ICT project, so you may well see\nyour suggestions implemented in the not too distant future.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Please take part, and if you have any\nquestions get in touch with me.\nBen Harris\nDeputy President\n(Education & Welfare)\ndpew@imperial.ac.uk\nAs of the 14th February 2007, Imperial\nCollege Union became o\ufb03cially a\ufb03liated\nwith the National Union of Students (NUS).\nOne of the many bene\ufb01ts of being a\nmember of NUS is the new NUS Extra Card,\nwhich you can now buy online.\nThe NUS Extra card has been put together\nto o\ufb00er a range of exclusive discounts,\no\ufb00ers and competitions designed to\nmake student life more exciting, more\nmemorable and more rewarding.\nYou can use it to make your money go\nfurther on books, clothes, sports stu\ufb00,\nCDs, travel, computer gear, gigs, eating\nout\u2026\nAnd not just in the UK either; the Extra\ncard doubles as an International Student\nIdentity Card, so you can use it to get\nspecial o\ufb00ers and discounts when you\u02bcre\ntravelling abroad as well.\ngoto imperialcollegeunion.org\nfor more information\n\n"

To make up for this, I\u2019ve created a lovely double page spread\nfor your reading pleasures, and\njust like the pork content of a Pepperami, I\u2019m 150% dedicated to this\npage again.

Make the most of it whilst you\nstill have a will to live, and before\nthe exams start to hit you hard,\njust send an email to the address\nat the top of the page, and we\u2019ll be\nglad to accommodate your needs.\nIf nobody writes reviews, there\nwon\u2019t be a page because I sure as\nhell don\u2019t have time to go out and\nwrite them all. If you don\u2019t want to\nwrite for us, you could always just\nemail us anyway, we get quite sad\nand lonely down here in the Felix\noffice.\nAnyway, enough rubbish about\nrubbish, this week you\u2019ll see by\nturning your eyes slightly to the\nright, we\u2019ve gone Hard House and\nTrance crazy. Caz Knight was nice\nenough to write an account of her\nnight out a while back, when she\nchecked out Tidy at Heaven, and\nTaz Aliabadi had a wonderful time\nwith the weird hippie goings on\nat The Synergy Project in SeOne,\nand it sounds like quite a night by\nhow the review reads. Very con-fusing. This is why we don\u2019t touch\nthose mushrooms kids.\nIn other nightlife related news,\nif you haven\u2019t heard already, the\nwonderful And Did We Mention\nOur Disco is returning on Friday\n23rd February, with super secret\nspecial guests, and by their past\nlist of acts, the won\u2019t disappoint.\nI might even attend. It\u2019s sure\nto be better than the let down of\na new Indie \u2018superclub\u2019 (those\nwords should never go together)\nChalk. Nick Simpson checked it\nout the other week, and I must\nsay - I agree with his account of\nthe night, when I went there for\nthe Ed Bangers party recently,\nthe place was basically filled with\nhyperactive 17 year old children.\nI mean, it\u2019s just plain depressing\nwith you are the oldest person in\nthe room.\nFinally, don\u2019t forget to enter our\nlovely competition this week to get\nyourself some free tickets to The\nEnd. See over the page for more\ndetails.\nWe\u2019re\nback.\nAgain.\nGregory Mead\nNightlife Editor\nTidy vs. Extreme Euphoria.\nHard House in Heaven\nIt\u2019s time for...HOUSE. The Tidy boys and friends take over everyone\u2019s favourite gay\nclub, but fail to do themselves justice musically. Caz Knight checks it out\nevents usually kick off at 10pm so\nthe delayed 11pm start was a little\ndisappointing, but none the less we\nall waited patiently in line for the\ndoors to open. Nearly bursting with\nexcitement I almost sprinted into\nthe main room to get my groove\non. Surprisingly, the music kicked\noff with Trevor Machlalan playing\na very eclectic set, starting off with\nfunky house/electro progressing\ninto some filthy psy-trance and\nthen onto the much awaited for\nhard house we had all come for.\nNot perturbed by the slightly\nslow start to the evening, we\nkept on open mind to the ensuing\nsets. Unfortunately we were a\nlittle disappointed until one of my\nfavourite DJs, BK, came on at\n2am. Pure musical ecstasy where\nI danced with all the energy I had\nChalk?! Bring back Trash I say.\nTrash is dead, long live Durrr. Well\nit is what everyone is thinking, but\nthe truth is there is more than one\nnew electro/alternative night in\nLondon these days. On January\n13th Chalk was launched at Scala\n- a three room extravaganza that\nhas already played host to everyone\nfrom Shitdisco to Whitey. For the\nlove of the readers this intrepid re-porter, as a sign of pure dedication,\ninvested a Saturday night to attend\nwhat could be the new Our Disco\nand Trash all rolled into one.\nWe are all told appearances are\neverything, and sticking by that\nmaxim Chalk got off to a pretty\nshite start; although the queue\nwasn\u2019t filled with dreary, arsehole\nTrash-ites it was full of a gaggle of\nChelsea sixth formers, drinking\nLambrini and Rose from the bottle -nice. Inside it didn\u2019t improve much,\nthere where bedraggled teens who\ncould hardly dress slouched in the\nstairwells smoking as if it was just\nanother lunch break behind the\nphysics block and the dance floors\nof all three rooms were about as\nlively as a coma patient.\nTo anyone who hasn\u2019t been, Scala\nis a pretty big venue, spread over 3\nrooms (although one is just an annex to a bar), two harboured live\nbands and DJs. After a fucking\nhorrendous wait for the cloakroom\nwe headed upwards and onwards,\nthrough the tiny stairwell to see\na superb set from the Foals, fresh\nfrom playing Durrr on Monday. 50\nminutes of twatish dancing later,\nwe moved on downstairs, awaiting\nRadioclit. Because we were \u2018supersweet-cool\u2019 like all the other tossers\nthere we naturally spent the whole\ntime pushing past people, calling\nthem gay, pouring beer down peoples backs, not dancing, sitting on\nthe floor and getting super stoked\nabout tequila. Occasionally you\ncould spot a seasoned club goer and\nwithout a doubt their expressions\nread \u2018what the fuck is this\u2019. Gritting\nour teeth to bare it we threw shapes\nin the squalor that was room three\nuntil a mustachioed man beat us at\nTidy vs Extreme Euphoria\nHeaven\n26th January\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nstored up over the last month.\nRelentless driving bass lines,\nclassic tunes such as \u2018909\u2019 kept\neveryone going with no breaks for\nthe full hour. Next on in the main\nroom were Organ Donors. Their\nsets at Tidy weekender 10 and\nDance Valley left me expecting\nnothing sort of a work of art, yet\nI couldn\u2019t get into the music: a bit\ntoo much scratching and a bit too\nhard if that\u2019s possible! The rest of\nmy group seemed satisfied with it\nthough.\nThe three other rooms gave a\nchange from the hard house in the\nmainroomwithfunkyhouse,electro\nand trance: A rest was much needed\nafter 2 hours of non stop dancing\nin the main room. Andy Whitby,\nnamed the \u2018Saviour\u201d of hard house\nby his following, disappointed once\nagain with too much cheese and\ndesecrating classic tunes. The only\n3 minutes of the set I enjoyed was\na remix of Cade del Mar\u2019s \u201cenergy\n52\u201d. From then on the rest of the\nnight let Tidy down with a poor\nshow from Tidy Boys themselves.\nFrom a musical perspective\nthe night didn\u2019t do itself justice,\nhowever, much fun was had more\nbecause of the people there and the\nfriends I came with.\nI spent most of the night looking\nforward to my friend\u2019s after party\nwhich was to follow immediately\nafter [funnily enough].\nI might think twice before\nattending the next Tidy event in\nApril, although Tidy weekender 11\nwill definitely be one to look forward\nto!\nCaz Knight\nAfter a whole month off from clubbing and any form of dance music\nthroughout January (to detox and\nget my brain back in working order\nfor lectures and exams) January\n26th couldn\u2019t come soon enough: My\nreintroduction to aural hedonism!\nBeing a huge fan of anything Tidy,\nbe it previous Tidy vs Extreme Euphoria events, weekenders or music\nfrom the record label, I was sure I\u2019d\nbe guaranteed an awesome night in\none of my favourite London clubs.\nHeaven, owned by none other\nthan Virgin\u2019s Richard Branson, is\nusually a gay club (please don\u2019t go\nduring the week: mondays-fridays it\nplays a dodgy mix of RnB and club\nclassics and unless you are gay I\u2019m\nsure you wouldn\u2019t appreciate being groped as you make your way\nacross the dancefloor!). However,\nat Tidy there\u2019s nothing to make the\nnon-gay community uncomfort-able: quite the opposite, when you\ngo to Tidy events you find yourself\namongst a very friendly and colourful crowd, something very refreshing form the usual drunken brawls\nyou find yourself surrounded by at\na lo of \u201cmainstream\u201d clubs. Heaven\nhas a 2000 capacity and because of\nits layout, one never feels cramped\nand it never takes more than a few\nminutes to find your way to the toilets or be served at the bar.\nNot wanting to undo all the good\nfrom my detox and to be able to\nproperly stomp to my favourite DJs,\nI decided to stick to water (\u00a32.50)\nand red bull (\u00a32.60), not too bad\ncomparedtosomeclubsinHeaven\u2019s\nvicinity.

Sadly, despite the\nenormous size of the backdrop before me, I soon realized that from\nthe fourth floor of Earls Court the\nstages appeared miniscule and the\npeople themselves were singularity points.\nBy the time the ubiquitous warm-up guy had cascaded onto the\nstage, I was growing increasingly\nanxious; however, this was nothing\nto do with anticipation for the show,\nit was merely due to a camera on a\nlarge mechanical arm which decided to focus itself on the section of\nthe audience I was sitting in. After\nstaring down the levitating camera\nfor a good few minutes, it suddenly\nrotated towards the stage, and the\ntwenty second countdown blared\nout from the speakers.\nRussell Brand meandered onto\nthe podium as the crowd burst into\ncheers, many of them reveling at\nthe fact that they were on televi-sion. I fortunately escaped this fate\nby not being famous enough. Darn.\nApparently this was the first live\nshowing of the Brit Awards since\n1989, so of course everything had\nto go perfectly. Even from where\nI was perched I could see several\nbouncers trying to control some\nof the celebrities who had already\ngone overboard and were drowning\nin a champagne supernova.\nScissorSistersopenedtheawards\nceremony with a generously flamboyant rendition of I Don\u2019t Feel\nlike Dancing with a most bizarre\ndisplay of gravity-defying, flying\nlegs. I know it was executed using\nblack-clothed dancers on an equally black background, but again, my\nslip on reality increased exponen-tially. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t really\ncomplaining.\nBest Live Act was the first award,\nand it was not surprising at all that\nMuse topped the list. Each of the\nawards was presented by musical\nartists or celebrities of particular note, including Simon Pegg of\nShaun of the Dead fame, and Ricky\nWilson of the Kaiser Chiefs, star of\nlast year\u2019s Brit Awards ceremony.\nEvery recipient of each award were\npresent and accounted for with the\nexception of the Arctic Monkeys,\nwho were clearly away doing more\nimportant things. The seemingly\nomnipotent northerners won the\nawards for Best British Group and\nBest British Album. Seriously, is\nthere anything they are nominated\nfor that they don\u2019t win?\nSnow Patrol\u2019s performance of\ntheir supremely popular single\nChasing Cars was one of the best\nof the night but they walked away\nwithout the award for Best British\nSingle; that honour went to Take\nThat and their single Patience,\nwhose five minutes on stage caused\nevery single female in the room to\nsqueal into ultrasound and every\nmale to cower in fear.\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers were\necstatic upon reaching the stage,\nand the crowd-pleasing Dani California, refreshingly different from\nthe recorded album version, provoked even the most fur-laden Alister kilometers beneath my balcony view to stand to attention.\nRussell Brand\u2019s commentary\nproved to be far more successful\nMatty Hoban\nis not amused\nW\nassup y\u2019all?\nWell, you may\nhave noticed\nthat the music\nsection has been\nsporadic/shambolic in content. If\nyou haven\u2019t noticed, then thanks\nfor your ignorance, it makes me\nfeel better.\nAnyway, yeah, to be honest I\u2019ve\nnot been that excited about much\nlately save for the Do Make Say\nThink album but that has been on\nmy various musical playing devices for a while. I\u2019ve seen a couple\nof interesting London bands lately\nsuch as Man Aubergine, but they\nare lacking something that I can\u2019t\nquite put my finger on. Basically, I\nneed some tunes!\nYea, where are the tunes at? All\nI\u2019m hearing lately is aimless drivel\nand I think there are many reasons for this. Ultimately, I\u2019d blame\nthe internet. As much as I think it\nis great that you can hear all kinds\nof music and get exposure as a\nband, that is one of the problems\nwith it. There are simply too many\nbands writing too much music.\nGone are the days when a band\nwould hone their skill through\nlaborious writing, gigging and rewriting before either withering\naway into nothing or become a\nforce to be reckoned with. There\nseem to be no great pioneers because the amount of time they\u2019d\nspend playing their music would\nforce them into making something\nthey\u2019d love and others would love\ntoo.\nHowever, thanks to MySpace,\nillegal copies of recording software obtained through Bittorrent\nand cheap, available hardware,\nanyone can write guff, record and\nthen get 500 people to listen to\nit. There seem to be two options\nopen to bands now: you meet up,\nwrite some derivative songs, and\nwhore yourself out because the\nsongs will be so derivative that\nthey won\u2019t be challenging to anyone and you\u2019ll make money (eg.\nArctic Monkeys); the second option is to make less derivative music but be so overwhelmed by the\nsheer volume of music around you\nthat your lack of overt accessibility\nmeans you\u2019ll spend your time playing to just about enough people to\nverify your existence as a band\nbut never get true recognition.\nTomorrow (Saturday 24th February) we have four bands who\nhave spent a lot time taking the\nsecond option: come and support\nthem (look at the poster overleaf).\nthan many of us were expecting,\nconvincingly embarrassing Robbie\nWillaims for yet again stumbling\ninto rehab, whilst accurately likening Amy Whinehouse\u2019s voice to that\nof a cab driver.\nThe Killers, recipients of both\nBest International Group and Best\nInternational Album, stunned the\naudience with an explosive performance of When You Were Young,\nshortly before Corrine Bailey-Rae\nshowered the Brit School audience with millions of golden tickets,\nprobably allowing all of them to finally enter the legendary chocolate\nfactory.\nDuring the advert breaks, the\naudience was shown clips of last\nyear\u2019s awards ceremony, but I was\ntoo busy scanning the tables below\nme; it seems that a three course\nmeal set on platinum plates had occurred at some point. Miles above, I\ncould only think of how much of my\nstudent loan I could pay off with one\nof those plates.\nBefore the end of the perform-ance, I was horrified to watch Justin Timberlake accept the award for\nBest International Male, over the\npoetic Damien Rice. There were\nsome strange anomalies in the distribution of the silver statuettes this\nyear, but this was by far the most\noutrageous. It seemed the people\naround me concurred, and I was\nquite surprised at the bravery of a\ncertain man to my left who decided\nblaring out a particular obscenity\nduring a relatively quiet section of\nthe speech was the best course of\naction.\nConcluding the night was the\nhighly anticipated extended set of\nOasis, who accepted their award for\nOutstanding Contribution to Music\nwith typical Oasis flare. Liam Gallagher was heard to curse about\nsomething, whereas Noel declared:\n\u201cSeeing that we don\u2019t get nominated for this anymore, I suppose it will\nhave to do,\u201d before grinning as the\naudience exploded back into life.\nTheir extended set went beyond\nthe live coverage, and included\nMorning Glory, Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star,\nCigarettes & Alcohol and the truly\nanthemic Don\u2019t Look Back In Anger, all of which caused every single\nliving soul in the gigantic arena to\njump about in celebration of this\nband\u2019s legacy, including Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol and Dominic\nHoward of Muse, prominently visible from the balcony above.\nThe instant Oasis disappeared,\nwe were all ushered out of the building so that the musicians and those\nlucky/wealthy enough to obtain a\nVIP Pass could commence the after\nshow party. Making my way down\nthe (unnecessarily) gargantuan\nflight of stairs I was barged out of\nthe way by several photographers\narmed with at least seven cameras\neach, all costing probably more\nthan my annual tuition fees.\nI was impressed by the amount of\ntext messages I had received during the two-and-a-half hour show\nberating the judges/voters for their\ndecision regarding Take That\u2019s sin-gle, perhaps even more significant\nwas the sheer volume of text messages I had received regarding my\npresence there.\nIt was probably the most surreal\nmusical event I have ever been to.\nI suppose you could say I was Half\nThe World Away.\nRobin Andrews\nThe Brit Awards 2007\nEarls Court\nPresented by Russell Brand\nThe Decemberists\nThe Crane Wife\n(Capitol)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nalbum review\nIt has been a year since Picaresque,\nand boy have I felt it. Fans of the\nDecemberists like me are forced to\nsuffer. The problem is the distinct\nlack of any other band which can\nreplicate the uniquely diverse and\nmelodic indie-pop that The Decemberists produce so effortlessly. How\ntheymanagetodoitstillbogglesme.\nEach track has around ten different\ninstruments chirping and tweeting\nin the background, yet they always\ncompliment each other to create a\nperfectly balanced song.\nIt\u2019s here that The Decemberists\u2019 strength lies. The flexibility\nof their instrumentation enables\nthem to craft each and every second of sound exactly as they want\nit. The rich atmospheres they create completely absorb you without\nyou even knowing it, transporting\nyou to the fantastical worlds they\nare describing.\nTake for example the title track,\nThe Crane Wife 1 & 2. This twelve\nminute epic retells part of an old\nJapanese story in exquisite detail\n(the first track on the album, The\nCrane Wife 3 finishes it). The beauty in the song comes in the transitions between the chapters.\nThe opening verse contains only a\nplucked guitar with touches of vio-lin, exactly mirroring the isolation\nexperienced by the poor farmer.\nAs he stumbles across an injured\ncrane which he nurses back to\nhealth, the song musically explodes.\nHorns blow, symbols crash and organs squeal for mercy. The amazing burst of energy wakes us from\nthe depression of the first verse, as\nthe crane jolted the farmer out of\nhis misery.\nThat is the brilliant thing about\nThe Decemberists; you can read\nas deep as you like into their mu-sic, but at the end of the day it just\nsounds great. For anyone who likes\nmusic with its heart on its sleeve,\nI couldn't recommend this album\nmore.\nFrancesco Padormo\nThe scary sight of a music industry patting each other on the back\nROBIN ANDREWS\n18 Friday 23 February 2007\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

    "content": "Debating society made its first foray into foreign lands on the first of\nthis month, as it boarded a Luton\neasyJet flight to Bremen, Germany.\nWe sent two teams (A: Till Stenzel\n& Edmund Hunt, B: Aneurin Young\n& Adrienne De Souza) and one\njudge (Hannah Gray) to the debating tournament of International\nUniversity Bremen, IUB Open 2007.\nI happily hasten to add that the\nwhole tournament was conducted\nin English, as are most modern European competitions. I don\u2019t think\nmy GCSE German would have been\nup to much, alas.\nAs fortune would have it, my\nteam mate Till was actually from\nBremen. Therefore, when we arrived we were picked up from the\nairport by his ever-helpful mother,\nto spend the first night at his house.\nIn the morning we had a quick tour\naround the beautiful old city, host\nof much history. As we would do\nfor the whole tour, we ate generous\namounts of fortifying German food,\nbefore arriving at the IUB around\n5pm for registration. The IUB is a\nrare thing in Germany (Europe, in-deed): a privately built and funded\nuniversity. There was thus a characteristic free-spirited attitude\nfrom the competition\u2019s organisers\nand students. As it happened, the\nOpen\u2019s tagline was \u2018Total Debauchery: Reloaded\u2019. This promise would\nbecome increasingly fulfilled as the\nrounds progressed.\nAs is usual at IVs, we waited an\ninordinate amount of time as latecomers arrived and the hapless\ntech-support chap fiddled with the\nuncooperative PowerPoint technol-ogy. But eventually the first motion\nwas announced (THW Privatise\nAll Universities) and we sprang\ninto action. I should add at this\npoint that IVs are utterly exhaust-ing. This is because they consist of\nprotracted periods of stressful waiting between rounds, heightened\nanticipation as the next motion is\nannounced, frantic brainstorming\nand discussion with your partner\nduring the 15 minutes prep time before the debate, and a solid hour of\nintense, rapidly shifting arguments\nin the debate itself. This was all\nthe more heightened as speeches\nwere to be seven minutes of length,\nrather than the usual five you find\nin other IVs. After a slightly weak\nwin in the first round, me and Till\nwent on trounce our opponents in\nthe second, debating a classic motion in the legalisation of bestiality.\nThis despite the fact that, due to a\nlate start, we were debating until\nabout 1230 at night. Imperial B had\na first and a second, so at the end\nof the first night we were all in high\nspirits. As promised, we went on to\nthe IUB student bar for free beer:\nBecks is brewed in Bremen, so we\nwere drinking its various forms for\nthe duration. Taking the coward\u2019s\nway out \u2013 an early night \u2013 we left\nat 2am to wander over to the youth\nhostel room we had been given near\nthe university.\nIn the morning we were (helpful-ly?) encouraged out of bed at 745am\nby the rather insistent Germanic\ntones of a volunteer. After a curious\nbreakfast of salami and strawberry\njam the bleary-eyed contestants assembled in the main meeting room.\nImperial A came across a non-start-er in trying to propose a motion limiting the number of foreign players\nin domestic club football. We came\nfourth. Somewhat dejected, we\nsteeled ourselves for the final two\nrounds. These were \u2018closed adjudication\u2019, so we were not to be told\ntheir outcome until the final \u2018break\u2019\nof those teams with enough points\nto reach the semi-finals was announced in the evening. But goaded\ninto passion our analysis and rhetoric reached new heights in motions\nabout NATO intervention in the Sudan and preventing the developing\nworld from using nuclear power.\nAmusingly, Imperial A met B in\nthat final round, and the outcome\nwas left temporarily ambiguous.\nTreated to a novel pancake dinner\naboard an old sailing ship docked in\none of Bremen\u2019s rivers, we then arrived at the big Saturday night party.\nPerhaps it was just nervous anticipation of the break announcement,\nbut it was one of the best parties I\u2019d\nbeen to for a long time. Those Germans certainly know their techno-cheese. With whoops of delight\nfrom Imperial A, we learnt at 1am\nthat we\u2019d broken fourth out of 50\nteams, comfortably into the semi-finals. Hannah too \u2018broke\u2019 as one of\nthe semi-final judges, impressing\nthe convenor with her thoughtful\ndecisions. Sensibly chickening out\nof contention for the \u2018last man at\nthe bar award\u2019, we left to catch another six hours\u2019 sleep.\nNow things became a little more\nserious. The semis and final were\nopen to a public audience, and so\nwhen, at 11am the Sunday morn-ing, the semi-final motion was an-nounced, the stakes were higher.\nFortune smiled upon Imperial A\nhowever, and we were second prop\nfor a motion legalising holocaust\ndenial (in Germany and much of\nDebauchery and debate in Bremen\nEurope that is still very much a\ncrime). Till knew this topic well,\nand I devised an interesting angle\nabout the role of martyrdom in fascist ideology, so we put in a solid\nperformance. Later on that day all\nthe competitors made their way to\nthe downtown Bremen concert hall,\n\u2018Die Glocke\u2019, for the final. We were\nconfident that we\u2019d done well, and\nsure enough, when the final break\nwas announced, Imperial A was\ncalled up to the front of the imposing hall. As in the semis, we picked\nthe position we were to argue out of\na hat. With a rather grim look on his\nface, Till drew out first proposition,\nand we were to be at the whim of\nthe motion: I confess that generally,\nit is easier to oppose an idea than\nargue its case. Sent outside of the\npacked hall into the foyer, we were\nhanded the motion on a folded piece\nof paper. \u201cTHW Put the Children of\nLong Term Unemployed Parents\nup for Adoption\u201d. Oh dear. In a truncated 15 minutes prep time (we\u2019d\nbeen promised 25), we did our best\nto dream up reasons why this was\na good idea. Called into the hall,\nup onto a spot-lit stage, Till gave\nit his best shot, and I followed up\nwith a plea to \u2018unplug children from\nthese failing social networks\u2019. Understandably however, the public\naudience wasn\u2019t terribly sympa-thetic, giving warm applause to an\nopposition speaker who likened it\nto ethnic cleansing (yawn!). Still, I\nfelt we\u2019d done a decent job with a\ndifficult motion. However, the win,\nwhen announced, went to first op-position. They\u2019d done well in previous rounds, and I suspect the judges felt they deserved it for a good\noverall performance.\nBut there you have it: we still\nmade it to the final, which was a\nfirst-time for both me and Till (and\nImperial itself, perhaps?) Nothing\ncan compare to the experience of\ndebating in front of a diverse public\naudience: it really is elating. On my\nprotracted journey back to NW10, I\nfelt pleased that we\u2019d positively put\nImperial\u2019s name into the public eye.\nWell done, ICU debating: here\u2019s\nhoping for many more successes to\ncome.\nEd and Till prepare for 1st Round\nLondon International Model United Nations (LIMUN) arrived on\nFriday. For the second year run-ning, the event in which students\nfrom universities all over the world\ngather to debate significant international issues, was held at Imperial College.\nThe hoard of eager students descended on the opening ceremony\non the afternoon of February 16th,\nheld in the historic surroundings of\nWestminster Central Hall; venue for\nthe first-ever conference in 1946.\nAfter introductions by King\u2019s\nCollege organisers Ryan Soo and\nJehan Karim amidst delayed ap-plause, Sir Kieran Prendergast\ntook to the stage, delivering the\nkeynote speech. He spoke with the\nusual admiration for people under\nthirty years old taking interest in\nthe United Nations, and made some\npoignant insights into the conflict\nin Iraq, the issue over which the esteemed ambassador resigned from\ncivil service in 2005.\nNine committees of the UN were\nsimulated over the three day marathon that totalled fifteen-and-a-half\nhours of debate, discussion and\nlobbying on topics ranging from human trafficking, to water politics, to\nthe prosecution of Jospeh Kony, to\nthe situation in Israel and Palestine.\nThe security council was subjected\nto a fictional crisis in Lebanon, in\nwhich the militant Islamic group\nHezbollah staged a coup. Soon\nenough, Israel was launching \u2018surgical strikes\u2019 on suspected Iranian\nnuclear sites in retaliation to the\nshooting down of their foreign minister\u2019s plane.\nLuckily enough, the situation was\ndefused when a consensus was\nreached to disarm Israel and call\nfor a ceasefire across the whole\nMiddle East region.\nSaturday night\u2019s social event\naboard the HMS Belfast, moored\nnear Tower Bridge, was a welcome\nrespite from all the imaginary violence and disasters sprouting up\nduring the weekend, and was the\nscene of intercultural dancing and\nbinge drinking. \u2018Is this the way to\nAmarillo\u2019 translated well into the\nvariety of languages and nationalities in the mingle, and friendships\nwere sealed after participants exchanged facebook IDs.\nMany volunteers from Imperial\nCollege took part in the organising\nof LIMUN 2007.

The\nunsuspecting team happened to be\nour arch-enemy: the University of\nLondon Dragons. This local derby\nis always a closely fought game\nwith the previous encounter resulting in an 11-0 victory for IC. This\nyear, with probably the strongest\nsquad to date, we were confident\nof coming away with another big\nwin. The pre-game tension was as\nhigh as ever and we gladly accepted\nULUs request to play full checking\nand ensure a colourful match.\nWe arrived at Alexandra Palace\nwith three full lines and two goaltenders to find a very large mixed\nULU B team waiting for us. So large\nin fact, that there was only just\nspace on the game record sheet for\nall of them. After our fear-inducing\nroar of \u201cseparate the man from the\npuck\u201d the match got underway and\nIC skated fiercely from the start. We\nkept the ULU Dragons pinned in\ntheir end of the ice and tested their\nkeeper. It was clear that she was\nstruggling to hold onto our shots\nand there were numerous chances\non the rebound. Chris Swearengin\nfinally gave us something to show\nfor our work and opened the scoring with an unassisted goal mid way\nthrough the first period. We continued to dominate ULU throughout\nthe first 20 minutes and finished the\nperiod up 4-0. This was thanks to\nanother almost effortless goal from\nSwearengin and one each for play-er-coach Vince \u201cold school\u201d Miller\nand former president Ed Grant.\nThe Dragon\u2019s scaly armour had\nbeen compromised but she wasn\u2019t\nfinished yet.

    "content": "Sabb hustings\ndescend into\ncomplete farce\nA. Hack\nOur Man with a Pint\nFelix wishes to apologise for ever\nsuggesting that this year\u2019s sabbatical elections could be anything but\na farce (or at least, the hustings).\nThe first hustings took place on\nMonday evening after Union Council, the idea being that candidates\nwould face a \u201cQuestion Time\u201d grilling courtesy of the hacks present.\nFree food and drink (alcoholic and\notherwise) were provided in order\nto lure the \u201caverage\u201d student in.\nThe hope was that this would enliven hustings, which are normally a\nrather pedestrian affair.\nHustings have in the past been\nheld in the JCR at lunchtime, which\ntends to frustrate students who are\ntrying to eat lunch in peace in between lectures and labs. They have\nalso been held in Da Vinci\u2019s bar,\nbut these have proved even more\nirritating to the average student,\nmany of whom are merely there for\na pint and don\u2019t wish to be yelled at\nby a candidate with a microphone.\nHustings at the Reynold\u2019s Bar at\nCharing Cross Hospital have seen\nattendences of precisely zero, and\nwere in fact cancelled this year for\nthat very reason.\nAdopting a more informal approach was supposed to provide a\nmore entertaining hustings. John\nCollins, the Returning Officer, allowed questions from the floor, and\neven permitted a great deal of the\nless serious questions.\nHowever, in practice the hustings\nquickly became a complete joke.\nThe candidates were drowned out\nby heckling, and it quickly became\nclear that the only way to get the\ncrowd\u2019s appreciation was to answer every question in the most\nstupid fashion possible. The crowd\n(who were mostly drunk on the\nfree drink provided) jeered at any\ncandidate that dared to give a serious answer. John Collins did little\nto keep control of the proceedings,\nand has been accused by some of\nbeing drunk; he told Felix he wasn\u2019t\ndrunk, but was merely \u201ctipsy\u201d.\nOne candidate, Felix Sinclair\n(standing for Felix Editor), used his\nminute-long allowance for a speech\nto attempt to breakdance (poorly),\nand threw insults at the other can-didates. Another candidate, Diogo\nGeraldes (standing for President)\nconstantly spoke out of turn by\ngrabbing the microphone from Mr\nCollins and the other candidates.\nHis comments became increasingly more offensive, until someone in\nthe crowd accused him of misogyny,\nprompting him to stand up and de-clare: \u201cYes, I am a misogynist!\u201d\nThe debacle left a sour taste in\nthe mouths of many present; a\nnumber of hacks approached Felix\nafterwards to express their dissat-isfaction, one going as far as to call\nit \u201ca complete fucking farce\u201d. Many\ncomplained they could gain absolutely no information about the candidates whatsoever, and that the\ncandidates were denied a fair and\nunbiased hearing. RCC Chair Mark\nFlower (a member of the Elections\nCommittee) did his best to maintain\norder, but it was not to be.\nOther candidates for President are\nStephen Brown, Julian Gianuzzi, Jon\nMatthews and Sophie Spillard.

It\nhas grown to be loved by staff and\nstudents within the building due to\nits low prices (far lower than the\nmostly overpriced College catering)\nand friendly, individual service.\nClaud\u2019s was due to close last\nMay when the Bessemer Building\nand the Mines building were refur-bished; lobbying by the RSM and a\nchange in the refurbishment plans\nallowed it to remain.\nHowever, Claud\u2019s is once again\nin College\u2019s sights. It seems plans\nare afoot to replace the cheap and\nfriendly cafe with a College-run\ncatering outlet, along with typical\noverpriced College food and drink.\nResidents of the buildign are un-derstandbly upset at the loss of 35p\ntea, something almost unknown on\ncampus.\nA petition was launched by the\nRSM President, Seb Turner, and\nhas already collected more than 450\nsignatures, just shy of the 500 Mr\nTurner wants to be able to present\nto the College.\nThe RSM have also motivated\nstaff within the building to join\nforces to save Claud\u2019s. Mr Turner\nsaid: \u201cStaff are strongly backing it\nas well, and providing very useful\nadvice. I just hope that the impact\nthis has had will convince the college administration to seriously reconsider their plans.\u201d\nand began backing up. Though the\nfemale toilets were still functional,\nstudents had to be asked to leave.\nThe finger of blame appears to be\npointing at the Union\u2019s contractors\nworking on the building redevelop-ment, who have been pouring wet\ncement into the drainage system.\nCollege\u2019s contractors, AMEC, have\nsurveyed the drains and seen evidence of this, though investigations\nby the Union\u2019s contractors have yet\nto reveal any hardened blockages.\nThe priority for the moment is to\nrestore the drains to working order.\nVans have been spotted bringing in\ndrain rodding gear, and it appears\nthat the problem will be resolved\nnext week. \u201c\u2018Ere, they\u2019re full o\u2019 concrete!\u201d\nThe RCSU have finally unveiled\nthe location of the finale of the Science Challenge.

From the\nearly days of\nSpacewar!, it was all we had.\nThere was no \u201cAI\u201d and most of\nthe challenge was supplied by\nyour opponent (the other part\nof the challenge being the size\nof the machine it was being\nplayed on). But it was fun, and\ngamers were without shame or\nderision.\nThen came The Fall. Evil\nPac-Men and pixelly aliens\nwhispering sweet nothings into\nthe ears of Player Two, and\nbefore you know it someone\u2019s\ngone and eaten from the tree of\neternal life, and we\u2019re left in a\nbarren land of poor level design\nand forced to cover our nakedness in the shame of FMV sequences starring Z-List actors.\nYeah, even James Earl Jones.\nIt\u2019s been a long few decades\nin the wilderness, but it\u2019s clear\nnow that multiplayer gaming\nhas re-established itself \u2013 not\njust for PC Gamers, and not\njust in front rooms, but as a\nglobal way of gaming. Persistent online worlds, dynamic\n64-player conflicts, seamless\ndata sharing over always-on\nconnections.\nWe look at both sides of multiplayer this week \u2013 at one ex-treme, tens of thousands of\neuros up for grabs in the first\nbig gaming event of the year \u2013 a\ntrend growing the world over.\nAnd at the other end, playing\nthe Spacewar! way, with all\nthe players kept safely within\npunching distance for a Halo 2\nSlayer match.\nSingle-player gaming can\u2019t\ndie, because Pac-Man \u2013 however evil the drug-taking cheese-ball is \u2013 was right; other gamers can\u2019t always be there to\nplay with. But looking at how\nfar single-player gaming has\ncome over the years \u2013 from a\nmissing ball and a high score\nthrough to non-linear japes in\nthe Elder Scrolls \u2013 the prospect of multiplayer being given\na chance to play catch-up is an\nexciting one.\nOf course, there are inherent problems with multiplayer\ngaming, and the technological\ndemand is huge. But the consoles and the PC hardware\nseems up to the task now, and\nthat means the change needs\nto come from developers. Indie\nbreakthrough acts don\u2019t come\nall that frequently in the massively multiplayer arena \u2013 but\nmaybe now that will change?\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n28 felix Friday 23 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week in videogaming\nWhen Zone of the Enders, or Z.O.E.,\nwas released in 2001, some \u2013 if not\nmost \u2013 of its sales were down to\nthe Metal Gear Solid 2 demo is\ncarried free with it. A cheap trick,\nor clever brand sharing? Whichever, there\u2019s a sense of deja vu this\nweek as Crackdown finally reaches\nthe store shelves, and the Halo 3\nBeta Pass that it comes with finally\nreaches the 360.\nLeaked screens and videos of\nthe 360\u2019s biggest big name disappointed many fans, but the true\nhands-on beta will let them see the\nnew weapons and levels first-hand\n\u2013 and after all, we really doubt that\nBungie could have broken a winning formula like Halo quite that\nsubstantially.\nWinning formulae abound this\nweek, with the release of Final Fantasy XII after years of waiting. For\nthose of you that didn\u2019t crack under\nthe pressure to import, HMV will\nbe hosting a launch event on the\nFriday 23rd at their Oxford Street\nstore, around 12 p.m. Cosplay competitions and extra giveaways for\nthe early buyers will at least make\ndaytime London look a little inter-esting. We\u2019d suggest getting there\nearly if you do intend to get any of\nthe freebies.\nThe last-gen is fading, though, despite fresh releases such as FFXII;\nhowever, the next-gen remains in\na state of deadlock. The 360 is still\nshunned in Japan, but a report out\nthis week suggests a similar story\nin the West. Nintendo have managed to distance themsevles from\nthe mainstream bitch-fighting, but\nSony\u2019s wonder machine is apparently being kept on the shelves\nby the 360, performing well on its\nhome turf.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why, as they\u2019re\nessentially banging their heads\nagainst the same commercial\nrock week in, week out \u2013 latest announcements include a confirms\n120Gb 360 upgrade to be released\nthis summer, and research into a\nslimmed-down Playstation3 using\nnew CELL production technology.\nBy contrast Nintendo\u2019s design\nguru, Shigeru Miyamoto, spoke to\nCNN about his hopes that Nintendo\nA bunch of cocks reform to publish games \u2013 Electronic Arts nowhere in sight?\nGamecock\u2019s games promise a wide variety of unusual design approaches, like Mushroom Men (above)\nwould \u201cpull away\u201d from Sony and\nMicrosoft, and assert themselves\nas a very different kind of brand.\nMore good news from the independent publishing world, as the\nfragmented Gathering of Developers (GoD) reforms in a manner of\nspeaking, under the label Gamecock Media.\nThe new house hopes to have a\ncollection of next-gen games out\nin 2008, but the principle of GoD\u2019s\nreformation is more important, as\nit raises hopes for a stronger independent force in the new year, especially with Steam\u2019s repertoire of\nstruggling developers continuing to\ngrow.\nFinally, Tesco have managed to\nplug a loophole in their pricing\nsystems which led to them giving\naway XBoxes for free. Till prices\nwere showing up \u00a32.61 more than\nthe shelf price for a 360 Premium\nsystem, and that meant \u2013 under\nTesco\u2019s customer care policy \u2013 that\nthe product went to the shopper for\nfree.

We have joined the NUS, we\nhave reformed our governance struc-ture, we have entered into a Sports\nPartnership with the College, we undertook some painful but necessary\nreforms to our commercial services.\nWe can make great things from these\nchanges but need a President that is\nfully aware of the issues and has been\ninvolvedinthemthroughout.VoteJon\nMatthews for President and I will:\n\u2022 Ensure that we get the service we\ndeserve from the NUS especially the\npromised Science and Engineering\nNetwork.\n\u2022 Negotiate properly with College\nto ensure better co-operation without\nsacrificing independence.\n\u2022 Work for a model of postgraduate\nrepresentation that works and serves\nall postgraduates.\n\u2022 Ensure an energy efficient and\nsustainable redevelopment that continues to meet student wishes and\nrequirements.\n\u2022 Make all Union officers truly accountable and remove the hurdles\nthat still exist in calling officers to\naccount.\n\u2022 Ensure the gym remains truly\nfree, not charged for by the back door.\n\u2022 Be available to students whenever needed (I already work 100 hour\nweeks).\n\u2022 Continue the work to reduce bar\nprices, we have had three cuts this\nyear but can have more.\n\u2022 Improve Union catering, let\u2019s face\nit, it needs it.\n\u2022 Bring experience and proven\nleadership ability to the Union.\nYou cannot select a President on\n250 words, for more information,\nemail me at jgm99@imperial.ac.uk\nor watch out for me at hustings and\naround campus.\nJon Matthews\nUnion\nPresident\nDeputy\nPresident\n(Clubs\n&\nSocieties)\nM\uf761\uf76e\uf769\uf766\uf765\uf773\uf774\uf76f\uf773\nAs the Slate\u2019s DPCS candidate I\nwill support the policies of the other Slate candidates.\nThese include an office hour for\nsabbs to make them more accessible and the renaming of the posts\nof president and deputy president\nto Don and Capo, along with renaming the council and executive\ncommittee to the Commission and\nthe Sit Down.\nI will try to continue the war on\nbureaucracy, as I\u2019m sure every\ncandidate will promise.\nThis can be done by allowing more forms to be handed in\nelectronically.\nI will also try and increase the\nautonomy of clubs and societies.\nFor example allowing clubs to\ndecide for themselves how their\nAGM is run, instead of the usual\nway written in the constitution\ntemplate, or by reducing the newly\nelected officers form, by not including details about the non-essential\nofficers.\nMoney can also be saved by getting clubs to share.\nIt sounds so easy but if for example there are 2 scuba societies why\ndoes each one have to get expensive equipment or why do we have\n2 golf societies each paying for\nground hire.\nOur membership of the NUS\nshould be exploited: NUS campaigns like the \u2018Strong and Active\nUnions\u2019 can provide assistance to\nsocieties.\nFinally I will help campus\u2019s other\nthen South Kensington, get a fair\ndeal with regards to C&S.\nIt\u2019s true that my union experience as re-app and club officer\ndoesn\u2019t compare with that of my\nopponent but with me you are\npromised some fresh ideas.\nAlexander Balikhin\nWhy should you vote me for\nDPCS?\nWell I have seen first hand the\nproblems which clubs and societies face everyday; this experience\ncomes from being a club officer, in\na club and society executive com-mittee, and working in the student\nactivities centre.\nFrom this I would like to un-com-plicate the union, so make the everyday running of all clubs and societies less frustrating.\nThe union has to remember it is\nhere to help clubs and societies not\nto hinder them.\nThis means not freezing budgets\nwithout at least telling the commit-tee, as I have seen it do, or setting\ndeadlines which the clubs and societies only find out about with very\nlittle time to spare.\nMany of the countless forms\nwhich plague clubs and societies\ncould be implemented online with\nemail confirmation and updated\nversions from last year.\nAlso much of the finance system\ncould be automated online. This\nwould be a huge improvement leading to less paperwork, and the staff\nhaving more time to actually talk\nto the very people they are there to\nhelp.\nI believe the process in which\nclubs and societies go through to\nget anything online needs to be\nmade easier.\nPlus the time taken to get anything put online needs to be de-creased, if only to persuade clubs\nand societies it\u2019s a good idea in the\nfirst place!\nRemember a vote for me would\nbe for an approachable friendly\nperson that clubs and societies\ncould come to sort out any of their\nproblems.\nAlistair Cott\n\n"

    "content": "26 felix Friday 23 February 2007\nentenary\n100 years of Imperial, well almost\nIn a new section of Felix, Shiv Chopra will be keeping you updated on Imperial\u2019s Centenary celebrations\nJanuary 30th almost seems like a\ndistant memory for us all. I say almost as I can still picture all that\nCentenary cake on that day\u2026 It still\nhaunts my dreams! However, the\nday itself was brilliant and I have\nonly received positive feedback\nso far. To clarify a few things for\nsome of the students though, that\nevent was not our Centenary but to\nlaunch the fact that we were going\nto be 100 in the summer. So in a way\nit was a 99 and half birthday party\n\u2013 you know the half birthday parties\nthat odd couples and rich kids at\nschool used to hold all the time. A\nselfish excuse for a party you may\nsay but that is not true.\nSo why the glitz, culinary glam-our, balloons as well as Paddy Jackman and his team dressed up in\nEdwardian attire? Well, it seems\nthat\u2019s the only way we can entice\nthe students to break away from\nlectures and labs and get involved.\nImperial College has been ridiculed\nby other universities in the past for\nnot being able to hold its own in the\nentertainment side of student life,\nbut the launch event proved a point\nto our critics.\nOur students were out in force\nthat day, promoting their Centenary\nevents to every member of the College and some displayed their tal-ents. For me, that was the true reason for the launch. Our clubs and\nsocieties have worked so hard over\nthe past couple of months to create\na plethora of events throughout the\nyear, which I hope the launch has\ninspired you to attend.\nTo keep you all on your toes \u2013 apologies to people who do not have toes\n\u2013 I am going to remind you of all the\nwonderful events planned this year\nfor you in many ways. Firstly, you\nwill be able to read about them in\nmy regular article in Felix, which\nwill also include a rant from me\nabout the chaos that is my life and\na brief mention of my blonde lady\nfriend (A.A. Gill fans will know what\nI\u2019m talking about).\nSecondly, the last issue contained\na double-page pull-out, special edi-tion, limited batch, once in a lifetime centenary events calendar.\nThus, you have no excuse to miss\nall the events scheduled for the rest\nof the year. So, place the calendar\nsomewhere special, clear for you\nto read and check daily. I suggest\non a wall, stuck to your Blackberry\nor glued to your cat. If you cannot\nfind last week\u2019s edition then head\nover to the Medics\u2019 bar (Reynolds)\nin Hammersmith as we always receive our Felix late and will have\ntons left over. Finally, I will also update you on our running man, Ben\nRyall, who is taking part in the London Marathon for the student hardship fund.\nNow, I must carry out task one\nof three by mentioning this week\u2019s\nguest event: \u201cThe Creation\u201d. This\ntakes place in a few weeks time.\nBut before I do, just a quick mention of the many events that have\nbeen and gone on so far such as the\nHyde Park Relays, ArtsFest and\nEast Meets West. I hope that you\nattended at least one of the above\nCentenary events and have been\nwowed by the many different acts\ndisplayed by our students. One final\nreminder: this week is Green Week\nso make sure that you take part today as it\u2019s the final day!\nThis year, the publicity writes itself as ICSM Choir perform \u201cThe\nCreation\u201d by Haydn \u2013 a stunningly\npowerful, massive masterpiece \u2013 in\ncelebration both of IC\u2019s centenary\nand ICSM\u2019s 10 year anniversary. A\nmajestic whistle-stop tour of the 7\ndays of creation, all in one evening,\n(Friday 2nd March 2007, 8pm)!\nChamber Choir will also be performing some of their trademark a\ncapella and close harmony works.\nThe venue is St John\u2019s church\non Hyde Park Crescent, about five\nminutes walk from St Mary\u2019s & two\nfrom Sussex Gardens, so there really is no excuse for not coming! Look\nup W2 2QD on streetmap.co.uk.\nTickets are \u00a33 for students (or \u00a32\nif you\u2019re a member of Music Soc),\nso see you there!\nFinally, on my to do list this week\nis an update from our runner. When\nreading the update, read it out loud\nin a deep American accent with a\nsultry tone (similar to people who\nread out movie synopses in the cin-ema). It will make the article have a\npunchier feel and it will read like a\nplot to a Hollywood blockbuster.\nWhen PhD student Ben Ryall\ntook part in a competition to win the\nchance to become the College\u2019s 2007\nLondon Marathon runner, he did so\nto win! With an impressive performance in a fitness challenge event at\nEthos and a compelling statement\nabout why he wanted to run on behalf of the College, Ben was an ideal\ncandidate for the place.\n(I told you the voice would work!)\nBen has a long association with\nImperial College; arriving in 2000 to\nbegin his BSc in Biology and graduating three years later with first\nclass honours. Since then he has\nbeen working towards his BBSRC\nfunded PhD in Dr Huw Williams\u2019\ngroup where he has been researching pseudomonas aeruginosa, a\ntype of bacteria that affects individuals with cystic fibrosis. In March\n2007, when he has finished writing\nup, he will take up a post-doctoral\nposition within the same group.\nWhen he\u2019s not working with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a lot of Ben\u2019s\nspare time is spent pursuing sporting interests. His main passion is\ntriathlon, in which he represented\nGreat Britain in the European\nChampionships in 2006 and qualified for the World Championships.\nIt is perhaps surprising then that\nLondon 2007 will be his first mara-thon. Despite this, Ben is not taking\nthe challenge lightly, setting himself the impressive goal of completing the course in 2 hours 50 minutes\nor under.\nBen is using the Marathon place\nto raise money for the Student Opportunities Fund, which provides\nentry scholarships for undergraduate and postgraduate students\ncoming to Imperial. Sixty scholarships have been awarded through\nthe Fund since 2003, enabling gifted\nstudents to study at Imperial who\nmay otherwise have been unable\nto do so. The majority of funds to\ndate have been raised from alumni\nthrough activities such as the telethon and direct mail appeals.\nOn the cause that he is raising\nmoney for, Ben says: \u201cI came to\nImperial as a mature student and\nwas fortunate that my girlfriend\u2019s\nCelebrations\nparents were able to provide me\nwith accommodation. Without this\nhelp, I would almost certainly have\nnot been able to afford my studies\nhere. I am therefore only too aware\nof the outstanding chances the Student Opportunities Fund can offer\nto talented students who wouldn\u2019t\notherwise be able to attend this\nworld-class university.\u201d\nHe continues: \u201cI feel privileged to\nberunningmyfirstMarathonforIm-perial and hope that people around\nthe College will consider supporting me through sponsorship.\u201d\nBen\u2019s progress, including a weekly training diary, is being tracked\nclosely on the College website,\nwhere you can also pledge your\nsponsorship online: www.impe-rial.ac.uk/alumni/marathon2007\nPaddy Jackman, left, and company dressed in Edwardian attire to celebrate 100 years of Imperial\nSome of the stars of the magnificant East Meets West strut their stuff IC Marathon runner Ben Ryall\nC\n\n"

I have seen\nthis happen at election time for the\npast four years and I want to make\nthe Union a bit more sincere and\nrelevant.\nReporting for Felix on the Union and what it does for the past 2\nyears got me thinking about things\nthat could be done better.\nUnion politicians need to accept\nthat most of our members have no\ninterest sitting on committees, forums or filling out paperwork so we\nneed to engage with these people.\nWhy should they have to turn up\nto dull meetings to feel involved?\nA full manifesto is available online\nbut here are the highlights.\nElect me as President for more\nstudent discounts, less Union\nspam e-mails and making sure\nthat the NUS keeps the promises they made to us during the\nreferendum.\nI would also strive to keep bar\nprices as low as is economically\npossible and continue lobbying college over the wild disparities in the\nproportion of good degrees awarded by different departments.\nVote Stephen Brown for a more\nopen Union.\nStephen Brown\nUnion\nPresident\nWeeeey! I\u2019m Diogo (dee-oh-goh!),\na full-time 21 year old Portuguese\nmacho and a more occasional Biomedical Engineer wannabe. You\u2019re\nprobably now wondering why would\nsomeone like me, whose only Union\nexperience is having tried all the\ntypes of lager sold in Da Vinci\u2019s, run\nfor President. Well\u2026 I think that\nanyone can learn the bureaucratic\ncrap that you need to run it, but student life, my fellow friends, that can\u2019t\nbe studied in the library! You have to\nexperience it in order to completely\nunderstand what being a student is\nand how to solve our problems and\nthat I think I master. The following\nare some of the things I\u2019m aiming to\nchange in our college:\nbring fun and coolness to the\nUnion bars by organising more\ncommon events with the med-ics, Wye and the Royal Colleges\nof Art and of Music.\nget an outside bar in Beit Quad\nfor Summer Term chilling and\nrevamp Db\u2019s properly.\nprovide hot snacks to the Holland Club for all those PhD\nbinge drinkers.\ntry to get reading weeks and\ncreate the Teacher of the Year\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\naward in all the departments,\nimproving results and lecturing\nquality.\ngive more funds to departmental societies and organise career days within each course in\norder to help with professional\ndecisions.\nstart workshops and collaborations with the neighbouring\ncolleges of Art and Music for all\nthe repressed creative Imperial\nstudents.\nMore information in my Facebook group or when you see me half\nsober.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nDiogo Geraldes\nI believe that a good Union president is the person who best represents the Imperial College\nstudents.\nThe president is the elected\nspokesperson for the students of\nImperial and responsible for conveying the view of Imperial students to the rest of the country. I\nbelieve that I am that person.\nAs a first year I will be bringing fresh blood and new ideas to\nICU. I will still have to complete\nmy course after being president,\nso I care about how the Union will\nbe run.\nFinal year students may have\nunion experience, but may not\ncare as much for the future of ICU\nas a younger candidate as they\nare no longer a student, will they\nbest represent views of students?\nI am not going to tell what you\nwant to hear, or say I will do\nthings that I know I won\u2019t or can\u2019t\nto be president. Instead I will\nexpress things that I think need\nchanging:\nStella Artois on tap in the union!\nWhy isn\u2019t the country\u2019s most popular beer in the union?\nOpen a union run book shop!\nAre we becoming illiterate? With\nWaterstone\u2019s gone where will students buy their books? (yes some\npeople actually BUY books)\nHave more recycling facilities on\ncampus! I am no eco-warrior but\ndo feel we throw away too many\nthings that could be reused.\nI support all ideas expressed\nby fellow members of the \u2018Slate\u2019\n(Messrs. Balikhin, Holland,\nNarayanan and myself).\n\u201cYouthful enthusiasm and new\nideas vs. experienced old hacks.\u201d\nYOU DECIDE!\nJulian Giannuzzi\nVoting opens Friday 23rd\n& closes Tuesday 27th\nVote online at:\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\nEditor\u2019s note: these manifestos are provided \u2018as-is\u2019, with\nno proofreading or spellchecking.\n\n"
