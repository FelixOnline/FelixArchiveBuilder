They wanted directions to\na local late-night drinking establishment that I have frequented with disastrous consequences, and I was happy\nto show them the way. They were called Peta (no, I didn\u2019t\nget it either), Philippa, and the beautiful young lady to\ntheir right, I could not remember her name; the only fact\nthat sticks in my memory was that she was a secondary\nschool teacher of mathematics. Anyway, they invited me\nto drink with them in said establishment, and I declined,\nas your editor was rather fatigued from a long night of\nstaring at screens. In return for wussing out, I promised\nto mention them within the pages of this very newspa-per. Consider yourself mentioned, my dear troika (look\nit up), and should you be in the Union bar in the near fu-ture, I will be happy to consume a beverage or two with\nyou.\nAnd so I lead on to more serious things. If you were\none of the nearly one thousand that voted for me, I thank\nyou. If not, well, you had your reasons. I\u2019ve worked for\nFelix since pretty much the day I arrived at the College,\nna\u00efve, optimistic, and with zero alcohol tolerance. I\u2019ve\nstudied under such legendary editors as Will Dugdale,\nAlex Coby, and Dave Edwards, and consider myself one\nof the last of the old guard of Felix, having cut my teeth\non the rather hellish music section and lengthy \u201ceditorial\nmeetings\u201d (read: bar nights). I\u2019ve inherited a Felix that\nhas been thoroughly disliked by staff and students alike,\nand one that has descended into petty name-calling and\npoor quality tabloid journalism. I\u2019ve seen more strife\nwithin the Felix staff in the last year than I have seen in\nthe previous four editors\u2019 terms. I\u2019ve seen what I saw as\nthe spirit of Felix get lost somewhere in the accusations\nand recrimination. Felix has a long and proud tradition;\nwhere we\u2019ve held the College and Union to account in\nthe past, we\u2019ve done so with reason and balance. Our\ntone never used to be admonishing, but rather, a wonderful blend of irreverence and asshattery. I\u2019ve wanted\nto hold this position all my College life, and I hope you\nenjoy my tenure. If not, well, I\u2019ll wreck up the place. I\nknow where you live.\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nL\nife is strange. In my final column as Sports Editor last year\nI was rather rude about some\nof the contributors to these\nhallowed pages and now I am\ncharged with the responsibility of editing Felix\u2019s comment section. Do I regret\nmy intemperate words? Not a jot, is the\nanswer.\nSome of the content in Felix last year\nwas absolutely lamentable. Considering\nwe are allegedly a world-class academic\ninstitution the standard of writing in Felix left a lot to be desired. Instead of ob-jective, balanced journalism our column\ninches were littered with sensationalist\nYour newspaper needs you!\nStephen Brown\nComment Editor\njunk, paranoid grievance-mongering\nand terribly dogmatic pieces written by\nsingle-issue fanatics.\nSeveral of my acquaintances agree\nwith this rather uncharitable view of\nour publication last year. Where I would\ndisagree with them was when they\nblamed our Editor for all of the faults.\nIf some of the people last year put the\nsame energy into writing news stories\nor columns as they did into bitching\nabout Rupert, then Felix would have\nbeen a whole lot better.\nI recall several occasions last year\nwhere I got rather animated when I had\nbeen sent sports reports that read like\nthey had been put together by a particularly inarticulate eight year old. The\nsad thing was that more often than not\nthey had been submitted by students\nwho would claim that English (or some\nbastardised version of it) was their first\nlanguage. At the end of the day editors\nonly edit. Perhaps we could have been\na bit more proactive in recruiting more\nwriters but it is rather unfair to try and\nblame poor content on one individual.\nIt is on this note that I urge you all\nto get writing. Imperial is unique in\nthat it dosen\u2019t run any courses which\ntraditionally dominate campus media.\nWe should see this as an opportunity\nfor us scientists to present our inherently superior view of the world. I\u2019m\nsure I\u2019m not the only one round these\nparts who tires of the same formulaic\narticles that keep appearing in the national press. I believe scientists would\nmake better, more objective writers by\nthe nature of the topics we study. We\ndon\u2019t get away with pretentiously fluffing out essays with obscure literary and\nphilosophical quotes to mask the fact\nthat we don\u2019t know very much about a\ngiven topic. Our ability to call a spade a\nfucking shovel should make us perfect\nfor reporting the world around us. Why\non earth is the media and politics domi-ated by the arts? Perhaps it\u2019s just because scientists are too clever to bother\nwith either.\nIn order for us to present a more diverse set of opinions we need your help.\nI\u2019ve met several people at Imperial who\nwould make excellent writers. It would\nbe nice if some more of you could commit your thoughts to print for us. There\nare not many benefits about writing for\nFelix. It\u2019s a thankless task and you only\nreally hear from people when you\u2019ve\noffended someone, but I still would\nrecommend it. On the upside, the bar\nnights are quite good fun, so please get\nwriting!\nThe Land of the Free\nUntil this week, I had a very low opinion\nof Americans. Having never been there\nbefore now, my only real experience of\nthem was in the news, in works of fiction\nor simply through received wisdom. The\nupshot of this was that I had an image\nof Americans as self-centred, unfriendly and stupid, and yet this is entirely at\nodds with how I have found them to be\nin my recent experience.\nIn fact, even before visit-ing, I had met a great many\npleasant, friendly Americans\n\u2013 the occasional tourist or\nexpat \u2013 in Britain. Yet many\nof these were keen to further\npropogate a negative view\nof their fellow countrymen\n\u2013 decrying the extremist leanings of many, or taking a dig\nat the insular mindset of the\neighty-odd percent who have\nnever owned a passport. Being a trusting chap, I took\ntheir word for it on the basis\nthat they should know, of all\npeople. But I did not consider\nthat, since they had chosen to\nleave the country, for however\nlong, they might be somewhat\nbiased. After all, it would be\nunwise to base an assessment\nof the British character on ex-pats in the Spanish Riviera, so\nwhy should America be any\ndifferent?\nIn the few days I have spent in America, everyone I have met has been polite,\nfriendly and a good conversationalist.\nEven at customs, where I had expected\neven a low level of intolerance given\nthe events of recent years, there was a\nnoticeable lack of the officious air that\nconstant tales of high-handed officials\nwould suggest. Of course, I do not for\none moment assume that the whole\ncountry is like this by any means, but\nin all my travels around Britain I have\nnever experienced an atmosphere\nwhere bus-drivers will give impromptu\ncommentaries of places of interest, fellow passengers on the train will strike\nup a conversation upon overhearing\nyour own, and so on. Despite all my\nnorthern friends\u2019 claims, that sort of\nthing just does not happen even in their\nneck of the woods. However, I have\nbeen told that despite any good experiences I might have had of America, if\never I went to New York I would find\nthem to be every bit as unpleasant as\nI had been led to believe. And yet the\ndescriptions I hear of the iniquities of\nNew York are identical to those that I\nhear levelled at London and know to be\nuntrue here and am frankly no longer\nprepared to believe it about there ei-ther, no matter how many films seem\nto back it up, or how often the news\nsuggests it \u2013 once again, if my outlook\nof Britain were based on nothing more\nthan that, it would appear all but unin-habitable, since news and drama only\nexist where there is conflict of a sort.\nAll of this is obvious. Yet I have been\nwilfully ignorant of it, since it confirms\nmy prejudices regarding Americans to\ndo so and there is something deeply\ncomforting in that. And I know\nI am certainly not alone in this\n\u2013 almost everyone I know has an\nunflattering outlook on America\nand of Americans, even amongst\nthe most liberal-minded of them\n\u2013 those who would otherwise\nflinch at the prospect of being in\nany way discriminatory.\nThere seems to be a sense\nthat you are not actually being\nracist if you are only being racist about Americans \u2013 that they\nare a powerful enough nation\nthat a bit of slander here and there will\ndo them no harm (after all, they have\nrepeatedly made it clear that they are\nmore than than capable of looking after\nthemselves). Or perhaps it is simply\na protracted sulk over their latterday\nsuccess since kicking the British out.\nEither way, it is a deeply unsettling and\nmisanthropic notion, but no-one seems\nto think twice about it. But they are, after all, only Americans \u2013 so who cares?\n\u201cEveryone I\nknow has an\nunflattering\noutlook on\nAmerica\u201d\nDoes our scorn for Americans have any basis in reality?

Editor. The posts were part of\na discussion concerning a recent\nChannel 4 documentary about the\nplight of homosexual Muslims in\nBritain, and were made in late January of this year.\nWhile many of the posts were\narticulate discussions of the teaching of the Qu\u2019ran and the poster\u2019s\nown opinions on the subject, several posts, originating mainly from\ntwo individuals (posting under the\nnames Al Chemist and Haji), were\nmore extreme in their views. One\nof the earliest posts in the thread,\nmade by Haji, stated that his \u2018solution\u2019 to homosexual Muslims was\nsimple: \u201cbatter them.\u201d Al Chemist\nexpressed his distaste for the concept of homosexuality, inferring\nthat gay Muslims were not proper\nMuslims: \u201cthem and some other\n\u2018Muslims\u2019 are on my hitlist\u201d. Within\na few hours of the tip-off email, several of the comments had been ed-ited, including those made by Haji,\nwho replaced the word \u201cbatter\u201d in\nhis post with the less offensive \u201cverbally batter\u201d.\nThe Union has indicated it considers this a very serious matter,\nas it breaches several College and\nUnion rules concerning the use of\nIT resources and equal opportunities policies, and has subsequently\nworked closely with ICT, the College\nIT service, and the Islamic Society\nto identify the individuals posting\nunder the names Haji and Al Chemist. In a post later in the thread, Haji\nsigned off as \u201cSagir (Haji) Hassam\u201d;\nit has since been confirmed in a\ncomment made by Mr Hassam to\nthe City & Guilds online newspaper,\nLive!, that he did indeed post under\nthe name Haji. Mr Hassam was\none of several students disqualified\nfrom last year\u2019s Union Council elections after investigations by Council and the Returning Officer discovered they had used mailing lists\nto campaign, which is forbidden by\nthe Union Constitution. When he\nmade the posts to the forum, Mr\nHassam, who now works for UBS,\nwas an Officer of the Union, holding\nthe positions of Vice President of\nthe IC Finance Society, and Publicity Officer for Islamic Society.\nJohn Collins, the Union President, has made clear that he does\nnot hold Islamic Society responsible for the comments of the two\nmembers. He confirmed that the\nSociety had been asked to remove\nthe posts within a week; at the time\nof going to press, the entire forum\nhad been deactivated.\nMr Hassam has made both an official statement to Live!, and numerous comments on the article itself.\nHis defence is that he was misinter-preted, and that his communication\nskills were not sufficient to correctly convey his opinions on the mat-ter, stating: \u201cI have realised in retrospect that my individual thoughts\nwere incorrectly communicated on\nthis thread, and I did post further\nalong the thread that \u201cbatter\u201d was\na much too strong word, I meant\nbatter in terms of a verbal battering i.e. numerous discussions, not\nphysically hurting anyone. I would\nnever condone unprovoked violent\nactions against anyone regardless\nof sexual orientation, race or gender.\u201d Other commentators on the\narticle have been somewhat sceptical of this claim, with one anonymous wag calling himself \u201cWiggly\nWorm\u201d replying: \u201cWiggle wiggle\nwiggle! Haji needs to get out of this\npickle!\u201d\nThe posts could also be said\nto be an incitement to violence,\nthough this is currently under consideration by Union and College\nauthorities.\nAs Sagir Hassam has graduated\nand left the College, there can be\nno disciplinary procedure brought\nagainst him. The identity of Al\nChemist is uncertain, and he has\nnot come forward voluntarily. Investigations are continuing to attempt to determine his identity.\nA screengrab of one of the posts made by \u2018Al Chemist\u2019\nany multi-year membership would\nbe cancelled, and that the Society\ncould not trade at Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nHe also requested a list of names\nand CID numbers of people who\nhad bought multi-year member-ships, clarifying that he did not\nblame Miss Chow and her treasurer directly, as they were not on the\ncommittee last year. A number of\nother restrictions were also placed\non the Society, in light of past trans-gressions, including enforcing online voting for society elections in\nthe coming year. Mr Matthews reiterated that the society must abide\nby the current rules, such as having\nall events being approved by an appropriate officer of the Union, and\na requirement that all income and\nexpenditure be run through the Union accounts.\nNo reply was received from Miss\nChow for a week, at which point Mr\nMatthews contacted her again, on\nAugust 15, to confirm receipt of the\nprevious email, and to reiterate the\nrequest for a list of names of CID\nnumbers of those who bought mul-ti-year memberships. Again, the\nrequest went unanswered. On September 11, having received no reply\nfrom either of the two recipients, Mr\nLai and Mr Matthews took the decision to suspend the Society\u2019s activities for the duration of Freshers\u2019\nWeek, thus preventing them from\nhaving a stall at Freshers\u2019 Fair and\nraising online membership. No reply was received. On September 23,\nthe solicitors\u2019 letter arrived in the\ninboxes of the three Sabbaticals, as\nwell as the notoriously leaky Union\nReception email inbox.\nThe letter claims that Miss Chow\ndid not know multi-year memberships were being sold, and that this\noccurred under the supervision of\nthe previous committee members,\nas Mr Matthews does not dispute.\nIt also claims that she did not know\nthey were not supposed to sell\nmulti-year memberships, but the emails sent by Mr Matthews seem to\nsuggest that the Society as a whole\nhad been told previously. It is suggested that this information was\nnot passed over to the new Committee members at their unusually\nearly handover date of April 1.\nThe letter also discusses the lack\nof reply to Mr Matthews\u2019 e-mails.\nAccording to the letter, Miss Chow\nreturned to Hong Kong from Guam\non August 7, the date of Mr Matthews\u2019 first e-mail. The letter says\nthat after this, she went with her\nparents to a \u201cretreat in preparation\nof spiritual enhancement\u201d prior\nto her departing for India on September 8. During this period, Miss\nChow received two e-mails from\nMr Matthews, and replied to neither of them. Felix has discovered\nthat while at a retreat \u201cin preparation of spiritual enhancement\u201d,\nshe nonetheless had access to the\nInternet. Miss Chow made posts on\nFacebook, that well-known spiritual\nresource, to two of her friends, on\nAugust 8 and August 23 \u2013 the first\nexplaining she was back in Hong\nKong and the second expressing\nthe fact that she was busy \u201cholding freshers\u2019 reception, orientation\ncamp and parties\u201d. This is likely\nto refer to the events ICCS holds\nin Hong Kong for freshers prior to\nthem arriving at the College, according to Felix\u2019s source. Questions\nhave also been raised over an event\nheld by the ICCS in Hong Kong in\npartnership with the Hong Kong\nSociety of Warwick University, and\nothers. Neither the OSC Chair nor\nthe Deputy President (Finance and\nServices) knew anything about this\nevent being held, and no reference\nis made to it in the accounts of the\nICCS. The tickets cost HK$200,\nwhichisabout\u00a313.Itisnotclearhow\nthe money was divided between the\nparticipating University societies,\nthough no money has been paid\ninto the ICCS Union account. It is\nhighly likely that, as the event was\nheld in Hong Kong, there has been\nno opportunity for the members to\ninform the Union of the takings.\nIt is understood that Miss Chow\nhas contacted Vernon McClure, Academic Registrar, who acts as the\nHead of the Registry, asking him to\nrepresent her in this situation. As\nICU\u2019s disciplinary procedure has\nnot yet been invoked over the alleged financial irregularities on either the previous committee or the\nnew committee, the College is not\npermitted to be involved.\nMiss Chow\u2019s complaint seems to\ncentre around a statement made\nin an e-mail by Mr Lai, which said:\n\u201cThis is a very serious matter,\nwhich could lead to your degree\nbeing withheld or yourselves being\nremoved from the College.\u201d The solictors\u2019lettercommentsonthis,saying that Miss Chow and Miss Wong,\nthe treasurer of ICCS are seeking\nadvice on \u201cwhether or not such a\nstatement is defamatory\u201d. Felix\u2019s\ncopy of the Oxford English Dictionary defines defamation as \u201can attack on the good fame or reputation\nof a person\u201d, making it questionable\nwhether Mr Lai\u2019s statement could\nbe construed in such a way. The\nCollege authorities have confirmed\nthat Mr Lai was correct in saying\nthat a College disciplinary process\ncould result the \u201cpermanent expulsion\u201d of a student from the College; however, this punishment is\nreserved for the most serious of of-fences, such as bringing the name\nof the College into disrepute.\nThe grounds for suspension of the\nsociety are the selling of multi-year\nmemberships, forbidden by Union\nrules. The letter does not challenge\nthis, but instead requests evidence\nto show that current committee\nmembers were involved. It is not\nclear whether they were or not, but\nthere is prima facie evidence that\nshows that multi-year memberships were sold.\nAsked for comment, Union President, John Collins, responded:\n\u201cIt would not be correct for me to\nmake a comment at this point. I\nhave forwarded the matter onto\nthe College\u2019s lawyers for consid-eration, due to time constraints.\u201d\nJon Matthews and Eric Lai both responded that commenting would be\ninappropriate. Miss Chow has been\ninvited to comment; no reply was\nforthcoming.\nClubs have no individual, legal status within the Union, which means\nthe upshot of any legal action on the\nbehalf of ICCS would be the rather\nridiculous state of the Union suing\nitself.\nSince this story was written, Miss\nChow and her mother, along with a\nsolicitorfromWong&Co,haveflown\nto London to consult with their UK\nsolicitors. Mr Collins has received a\nletter from a London firm confirming the deadline for reversal of the\nsuspension as September 28, and\nthreatening legal action should the\ndecision not be reversed by today.\nAndy Sykes\nContinued from page 1\n\n"

    "content": "This album is perhaps not the best\nalbum out there. It is however made\nby a vital band. The reason for this\nis Steve Albini. He is well-known\nfor his production on Pixies albums\nand the last Nirvana album. He\nhas produced so many influential\nalbums that he has a certain myth\nabout him. Albini has also been in\nlegendary bands such as Big Black\nand Rapeman but Shellac is perhaps more accessible. Watch Song\nis fantastic song dedicated to the\nstupidity of brawling and fighting.\nPossibly another obvious choice for\nessential albums. But I am tired\nand need to hand this in in five min-utes. Ahem, I mean it is still an influential album and can introduce\nthe listener to a whole new sonic\nterritory.\nThis album may not feature Love\nWill Tear Us Apart but it still contains fantastic songs. These include\nShe\u2019s Lost Control which is incredibly eerie yet very immediate. This\nalbum not only focuses on melody\nand rhythm but puts a large emphasis on sound. At once sparse\nand vast, the sonic landscape that\nis painted is an ear-opener.\nThe record has an industrial veneer that could have only been conveyed in the grey that is Manchester in the late seventies.\nJazz, jazz, oh jazz. One of the most\nmaligned genres around. If you are\na fan of jazz then I\u2019m sure you know\nabout this album. This is the last\nalbum in the classic quartet form.\nAfter this album, Coltrane went\navant-garde and alongside with Ornette Coleman, wandered into new\nYet another band to emerge from\nthe Olympia, Washington scene -which also spat out Bikini Kill and\nNirvana amongst others - but relocated to Austin, Texas. Trail of Dead\nmash together the indie rock noise-making of Sonic Youth with more\nrock\u2019n\u2019roll influences. It is high octane melodicism and reflects the\nAustin, Texas scene at the time. For\nclassic rock fans this album can expand your tastes whilst giving you\nsomething you can still relate to.\nThis is an album that a lot of people\nhave heard of but have not actually\nheard. It is a seminal hip hop album\nin every aspect. The music uses infectious and brilliant samples with\nhardline political views.\nIt is hard to deny the greatness\nof an album which feature tracks\nsuch as Don\u2019t Believe the Hype and\nRebel Without a Pause. If you ever\nneeded music to soundtrack your\nslow politicism at university or just\ngeneral angst then put this on.\nThis album might seem a bit obvious but it has London in the title, so\nthat\u2019s why it is in. Also, it\u2019s a punk\nalbum that brushes with a lot of\ngenres.\nThe Clash\u2019s 1979 opus is the ultimate London album from the ultimate London band. From the opening striking chords of the title track\nyou\u2019re dragged through a machine\ngun blitz of punk, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, reggae and everything in between. All\nof this is topped off with Joe Strummer\u2019s visceral lyrics. Quite simply\na classic.\nFavourite First Year Albums:\nNick Simpson says:\nAt the Drive-In,\nRelationship of Command\nKeira Poland says:\nRufus Wainwright, Poses\nThis is one of the true iconic albums\nof the 90s. If you like Mogwai, then\nmaybe you\u2019ll know that they owe\neverything to Slint. This album\nspawned more genres that you can\ncount on one hand. Math-rock, post-rock, indie-rock, whatever you call\nit, the music is constantly shifting\nand evades pigeon-holing.\nFolk is becoming more acceptable\nat the moment and is not just dismissed as music for bearded old\nmen. Nick Drake\u2019s Nine Leaves\nLeft is a nice place to start but\nslightly obvious. Iron & Wine also offer beautiful music however it\u2019s still\nvery traditional. Animal Collective\nare from New York and add a lush\nexperimental edge to sparse folk\nyet retaining a pop edge. Magic.\nForget The Automatic and The\nKooks, Pavement are real indie-pop. Where the former bands tread\nthe same ideas and melodies used\nso many times before, Pavement\nwere real experimenters.\nTheir first album, Slanted and\nEnchanted remains a classic to this\nday. However a good place to start\nwith Pavement is their second al-bum, Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain.\nThis album is better produced and\nmore accessible that their debut\nbut Stephen Malkmus\u2019 (who also\nwas in Silver Jews) lyrics are still\ninsanely skewed and sharply bril-liant. Cut Your Hair is so immediately great in its sardonic nature\nthat it is irresistible.\nEveryone has heard of Sonic Youth\nbut they are often associated with\nNirvana and that horrible word,\n\u2018grunge\u2019. This is purely due to bad\ntiming.

If\nyou haven\u2019t yet strained your eyes\nabout two and a half inches upward\non this page; this is the music section of the mighty organ that is Felix. Now for the patronising bit.\nUniversity should be a voyage of\ndiscovery. There are parts to you\nthat you may not even know about.\nWe are not suggesting that you invest in a room full of mirrors so you\ncan perpetually observe your nether regions. Okay, let\u2019s start again...\nWhen we first came to univer-sity, we wanted to learn about as\nmuch as possible, both inside and\noutside our \u2018proper\u2019 subjects. This\nnaturally included music and its\nvarious forms. You might be equally\ninquisitive.\nSo here at Felix, we\u2019d thought\nwe\u2019d offer you up some of the albums that we adored in our first\nyear. Along with these, there is a\nlist of 10 \u2018essential\u2019 albums that can\nhelp open you up to a vast world of\nmusic that lies ahead, if you wish to\npersue it. They\u2019re not necessarily\nthe best albums ever but the ones\nthat can expand your tastes.\nWe don\u2019t wish to patronise you,\njust to suggest some stuff that you\nmight like. If you think we are smoking some of that crack stuff that we\nkeep hearing about, and our suggestions are awful, or if you can think\nof other albums everyone should\ndefinitely hear then get in touch.\nThis section is always looking\nfor reviewers. The rewards of this\nis that you get access to FREE\ngigs and FREE CDs and in return\nwe should want you to write about\nthem. Or if gig photography is a\npassion of yours then we can exhibit\nyour work. Also it is a great opportunity to meet like-minded people.\nThis section is run by three editors so that the workload of being\na music editor doesn\u2019t clash with\nout degree studies, since we are\nall in our third year here. It also\nmeans that there should be at least\none of us around for you to harass.\nYou can get in touch by popping\nalong to the Felix stall at Freshers\u2019\nFair or by e-mailing us at music.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk. Don\u2019t worry\nif you haven\u2019t done any reviews be-fore. Our first years were the first\ntime that we had ever put fingers\nto keyboards and ranted away.\nThe music section will also be\nhelping to put on a gig on in the\nunion on October 13th. We have\nselected a band to play alongside two bands that are playing\non that night. The section is also\nconnected to the Alternative Music Society and so look out for\nevents organised by them here.\nEnjoy this week\u2019s feature and\nreviews. If you want to contrib-ute, please don\u2019t hesitate to get\ninvolved. Without voluntary contributions we would be nothing!\nJenny Gibson, Matty Hoban,\nand Tom Whitson\nMusic Editors\n15 Thursday 28 September 2006\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfelix\nR\n\n"

Or better off out?\nA\ns we move towards Imperial\u2019scentenaryyear,\nour College is ready to\ntake a step forward to\nbecome a University\nin its own right when it leaves the\nUniversity of London. But for our\nstudents\u2019 union, this move will be\na step back when we leave the University of London Union.\nFor the first time in over 50 years,\nwe will be on our own, isolated\nand mute without a national voice.\nAs we gear up for a referendum on NUS membership, Alex Guite makes the case in\nfavour of joining and warns against the potential consequences of opting out\nWhen our own Rector proposed\ntop up-fees in 2002, it triggered a\nnational campaign. With the real\nthreat of top-up fees rising and\nmore national upheaval in higher\neducation within three years, this is\nnot the time to be cut off.\nFrom the discounts membership\nwould give us as students to the\ngreater say it gives our Union, it is\ntime to look again at our membership of the National Union of Students (NUS).\nI still remember the my disappointment and that of my friends\nwhen we started university here\nand discovered that we couldn\u2019t\nget an NUS card, almost a symbol\nof student life itself. But more than\nthat, and the part which hurt our\nwallets, we couldn\u2019t get money off at\nAmazon, Topman, Pizza Hut or anywhere else that NUS has negotiated discounts for its members. From\nthis year, the NUS card comes with\na free ICIS card, extending even\nfurther the scope of discounts that\nare available to those in the NUS.\nIt was NUS lobbying which secured council tax exemption for\nstudents, the biggest student discount of all time. Could Imperial,\nor any university, have negotiated\nthis on its own? Therein lies the\nreal benefit of the NUS: that it is\nthe recognised voice of students.\nF\noralotofyou(infact,Idon\u2019t\nthink I\u2019d be wrong in saying most of you), welcome\nto England. A well done\nto all of the freshers that\nare gracing us with their presence\nthis year as you\u2019ve worked damned\nhard. Not only have you been pressured by your parents from an early\nage to do well in school, but when\nyou got to GCSE level you were told\nto work your arses off, you got the\ngrades you wanted and sailed into\nyour A-Levels, or IB, or Certificate\nof Competency, or whatever everybody else does where you come\nfrom. You toiled and broke your\nback with work for two years before\nfinally landing the grades to make it\ninto this prestigious institution that\nwe call Imperial College London (or\nsoon to be Imperial University, per-haps; frankly, nobody really knows).\nCongratulations.\nIf the above paragraph doesn\u2019t fit\nyou, which it almost certainly won\u2019t,\nthen you will be one of either two\ntypes of people who we regularly\nsee here \u2013 genius academics, who\nare the laziest people on the planet and will inevitably show up to a\ngrand total of three lectures in their\nfirst year and somehow end up with\na high first, or \u201cjust another Oxbridge reject\u201d. Have no fear though.\nI can see straight through you \u2013 the\ntruth is that you\u2019ll fit right in here\nand chances to slack off will be\naplenty despite the nasty rumours\nabout high workloads. Unless you\nwant to get a first. Then it\u2019s a completely different story.\nYou will be given the royal treatment here at Gimperial as our institution strives to be amongst the\nelite of the elite. The number of female students on campus is so low\nthat even the most rowdy male will\nbe forced to sit at a desk and learn\nsomething once in a while. Additionally, when you are considering\nstraying from your hard-working\nhabits in halls and begin listening\nto music or, heaven forbid, playing\nWorld of Warcraft, rest assured that\nthe alarms fitted in each room in\nthe halls of residences also react to\nfun, and when the fun levels in any\nhall get past a certain point, they\nare sure to blare and usher you all\nout onto the pavement for half an\nhour while your annoyed wardens\nrun around trying to figure out who\nused a chip pan to set three and a\nhalf kitchens on fire.\nLectures, on the other hand, are\nan entirely different matter. Whereas I have made the rest of Gimperial life sound rather harsh, busy,\nand unforgiving, lectures are the\nsafe haven where you are not only\nguaranteed the world class education that is offered here, but also\nthe much needed sleep you missed\nthe night before. Clearly then, as\nyou can see, your working life here\nwill have to be carefully balanced,\nand remember that it is always\nbetter to come in to lectures still\ndrunk rather than with a hangover\n(that\u2019s advice from somebody else\nthough).\nBeing serious just for a moment\nthough, whatever your race, religion (probably none), sex (prob-ably male), or drinking preferences\n(probably passed-out), you\u2019re entering a new chapter of your life\nand fortunately it\u2019s a pretty pleasant one.\nPretty soon you\u2019ll be out on the\nweekends with your mates doing\nwhatever it is that takes your fancy.\nTake a good look at Freshers\u2019 Fair\nand sign up for everything you may\nhave an interest in, you\u2019ll be thankful you did it later in the year. Don\u2019t\nfret about which hall you have because everyone will get more or\nless the same deal after you factor in price, and for goodness sake\ndon\u2019t pass out naked on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn at any time. Enjoy your Gimperial life, and remember the rest\nof us are here to help by making\nyour day just that slightest bit more\namusing.\nWelcome to Gimperial!\n\u201cYou will be\ngiven the royal\ntreatment here at\nGimperial\u201d\nWhen politicians or the media\nwant the views of students, is it to\nour Union or to the NUS that they\nturn? Whilst we remain outside\nof the NUS our voice is not being\nheard. On the day of the top up-fees\nvote in parliament, whilst the NUS\nPresident was negotiating with the\nEducation Minister, all our own\nPresident could access was a back-bench MP who had already decided\nhow he was going to vote. Imperial\nstudents deserve better. I am under\nno illusions about the NUS; I have\nno doubt that it needs reform. This\nis a view shared by the NUS itself,\nwhich has gone through root and\nbranch reform of its finances and\noperations. We ensure that we have\nan effective national body representing students by working constructively for reform from within,\nnot by sniping from the sidelines.\nEdinburgh, which voted to join the\nNUS in 2004, has been at the forefront of reforming the NUS. Should\nImperial join, we too would be at\nthe forefront of reforms.\nMembership of the NUS is easily\none of the biggest issues faced by\nImperial students in recent times.\nWith our circumstances radically\nchanged by leaving the University\nof London Union, it\u2019s time for a sensible debate. We simply cannot afford to be isolated.\n\u201cLeaving ULU\nwill be a step\nback\u2026 For the\nfirst time in\nover 50 years,\nwe will be\non our own,\nisolated and\nmute without a\nnational voice.\u201d\nAlex Guite\nW\nelcome!\nTo all fresher\nstudents, and\nthis is probably\nnot the first time\nyou\u2019ve heard this, welcome to Imperial College! To all non-Fresher\nstudents \u2013 welcome back! I hope\nyou have all enjoyed your well-earned summer break and are\nnow prepared for the forthcoming\nyear.\nAndy informs me that I will\nbe writing a weekly President\u2019s\ncolumn for Felix to keep you all\nposted on the latest news from\nthe Union. So I will start by telling\nyou a little bit about the exciting refurbishment projects that\nwe\u2019ve delivered this summer. The\nBeit Building refurbishment is\nwell underway and the first full\nvenue revamp, Da Vinci\u2019s, is now\ncomplete. The promised new\nlift is presently being installed\nin the core of the building and\nI will write about this project in\nmore detail in future columns.\nOutside of South Kensington,\nour Reynolds Bar has received a\nfacelift and the ground floor of the\nstudent union building at Wye has\nalso been overhauled. We hope\nyou like these lovely new venues\nand politely request that you treat\nthem well.\nThere is a lot more to ICU than\ncan be summarised in a short\narticle or a two minute freshers\u2019\nspeech. So, for the first time in living memory, we will be running a\nFreshers\u2019 General Meeting for all\nstudents on Monday 9th October\nat 6pm in the Union Concert Hall.\nIf you want to know more about\nICU and how you can get involved\nin its activities, then please come\nalong to this event (refreshments\nwill, of course, be provided).\nFinally, if you need to contact\nme about these columns or chat\nabout anything that concerns or\ninterests you, then please don\u2019t\nhesitate to email me at presi-dent@imperial.ac.uk.\nOn that note, have a brilliant\nfreshers\u2019 week and a fantastic\nyear to come!\nA very\nwarm\nwelcome\nfrom the\nUnion\nJohn Collins\nICU President\nJohn Sargent\n9 felix Thursday 28 September 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

    "content": "world stage.\nFrom the researchers\u2019 perspec-tive, the ability for scientists to\nthink entrepreneurially encourages them to think about their work\nin the context of society. The critical\naspect of starting any new business\nis finding a market, and to do so\nrequires a deep understanding of\nwhat people want or need. In thinking commercially, scientists are getting better at looking at their work\nwith the eyes of someone on the ex-terior. The smaller the gap between\nthe laboratory and the shelves, the\nless distant the scientific world will\nseem to the general public, something which is vitally important in\nrecruiting the next generation of\nresearchers.\nThe ICE launch event featuring\none of the world\u2019s leading entrepreneurs will be held in the first\nweek of term and open to anyone\nwho would like to expand their ho-rizons. It might be time well spent;\nas Kasem says gleefully, \u201cto succeed you\u2019ll need more than just a\ndegree.\u201d\nThe Imperial College Entrepreneurs will launch on 17th October\nat 6.30 on the Lower Ground Floor\nof the Tanaka Business School.\nThere will also be a \u2018Breaking the\nICE\u2019 session on 12th October for all\nthose interested in becoming members or just finding out more.\nCurrent IC spin-outs\nable to access resources in a flex-ible, time-efficient manner through\na web-based electronic forum.\nThe society aims to be as incorporating and interactive as possi-ble. It is targeted at all members of\nstaff and students and they intend\nto work closely with existing bodies\nwithin the college such as Imperial Innovations and the Venture\nCapital Club. IC Entrepreneurs is\nalso looking outside the college to\ncreate strong links with business\nschools (such as the London Business School) and companies within\nthe venture capital sector. Imperial\nis ideally placed, both geographically and academically, to attract\nmajor investors and already the\nteam have received significant interest from the groups they have\napproached.\nThis venture can only be a good\nthing for the College. Although the\nthorny issue of the sharing of intellectual property between researchers and their institutions is still a\nhot topic, it is evident that university spin-offs can provide enormous\nbenefits to both parties. As universities gain experience and knowledge in the world of commerce,\nthey are learning how to retain a\ngreater chunk of the financial fruits\nof their research. As seen in the US,\nthis money can be used to strengthen the university\u2019s standing on the\nInnovation Creation\nA new society aims to stir up the entrepreneurial spirit within the College. Toby Ferenczi speaks to the\nco-founders Sefian Kasem, Ross Richardson, Bobby Goulding and Shin Yang Cheung\n\u201cThere is only one way to make a\ngreat deal of money; and that is in a\nbusiness of your own,\u201d announced\nJ. Paul Getty, former oil tycoon and\none-time richest man in America. It\nis this realisation that has seen entrepreneurial activity grow drastically over the past three decades.\nFor people with ambition, building\none\u2019s own business has become the\nultimate achievement. With only\none in ten new businesses succeeding it is not for the faint hearted, but\nfor those with the drive and vision\nto spot a potential venture, the rewards could not be greater. As more\nprospective Richard Bransons join\nthe fray, the hunt for \u2018opportunity\u2019\ngrows ever more difficult, and since\nthe essence of science is innovation,\nthis has led to a strong link between\nscience and entrepreneurship.\nIvy League universities in the\nUS took advantage of this situation\nfrom an early stage, building networks of investors and their academic staff. This has been a major\nfactor in the success of both US universities and the US economy. Creating a new enterprise is perhaps\nthe purest form of productivity\nand, as such, entrepreneurship has\nbeen a huge driver of industry over\nrecent years. Although initially be-hind, UK universities are gradually\ncatching up with their transatlantic\ncounterparts. IC Entrepreneurs, a\nnew society this year, aims to propel\nImperial College to the forefront of\ntechnological venture.\n\u201cWe are dedicated to providing\nthe highest quality of resources to\nfoster the spirit of entrepreneurship\nand innovation across campus,\u201d\nsays Sefian Kasem, former Finance\nSociety president and IC Entrepreneurs\u2019 co-founder. Through a series of hands-on interactive events\nthey aim to introduce the theory\nof entrepreneurship and highlight\nthe practical skills required by\nentrepreneurs. \u201cWe want to simulate real situations so people can\nget involved, instead of just listening to lectures,\u201d Ross Richardson\nexplains. Games such as \u2018Dating\nwith Dragons\u2019 sound intriguing,\nalthough he reminds me that they\nare designed primarily to improve\none\u2019s business skills rather than\nlove life.\nThese activities will be complemented by networking sessions;\nevents that, in the founders\u2019 words,\n\u201cbring people interested in entrepreneurship together in a harmo-nious, supportive environment to\nencourage the cross-pollination of\nideas and the expansion of contact\nnetworks.\u201d Members will also be\n\u201cWe are\ndedicated\nto fostering\nthe spirit of\nentrepreneurship\nand innovation\nacross campus\u201d\nFrom left to right: Bobby Goulding, Lawrence Tse, Vincent Garcia Tormo, Nimi Iti, Yunlei Hu, May Chen, Zhangpeng Feng, Kyle Tang,\nAlex Pais Da Silva, Toby Ferenczi, and Ross Richardson.\nCeres Power\nFounded in 2001 by Professors\nNigel Brandon, John Kilner, Alan\nAtkinson, and the late Brian\nSteele, Ceres Power has developed unique \u2018solid oxide\u2019 fuel\ncells that operate at much lower\ntemperatures, allowing the cells\nto be made more cheaply.

Do you\nwant to join a society where you can\nwatch interesting movies, discuss\nthem with like-minded people and\nlearn more about film-making?\nLast year Filmsoc showed a wide\nrange of films, including Chung\nKing Express (directed by Wong\nKar Wai), Ichi the Killer (Takashi\nMiike), Bande a Part (Jean Luc\nGodard), Brazil (Terry Gilliam),\nand Coffee and Cigarettes (Jim\nJarmusch). We also organised trips\nto the Institut Fran\u00e7ais and the\nBarbican.\nThis year, we start off on October 5 with the Lars von Triers film,\nBreaking the Waves.\nBreaking the Waves is influenced\nby many of the ideas of the Dogme\nfilm-making movement. The goal of\nthe Dogme movement was to purify\nfilmmaking by rejecting the use of\nspecial effects and postproduction\ngimmicks in order to focus more on\nthe story and the actors\u2019 perform-ances. Lars von Triers announced\nthe movement in 1995 along with\nfellow Danish directors Thomas\nVinterberg, Kristian Levring and\nSoren Kragh-Jacobsen. Specific\nrules included that filming must\nbe done on location (i.e., without\nthe use of sets and props), sound\nshould be produced at the same\ntime as the images, the camera\nmust be hand-held, and the use of\nspecial lighting and optical filters is\nnot allowed.\nOver this term, we will also be\nscreening films from David Lynch,\nWoody Allen and Fritz Lang and\nwill be organising a trip to the London Film Festival.\nWe are a fairly new society and\nwe really welcome everyone who\nshares our enthusiasm for cinema.\nIf you\u2019re interested in becoming\na member, e-mail victoria.\nsanderson@imperial.ac.uk, or go\nto www.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/clubs-and-societies/a-to-z/f/\nfilmsoc/\nlubs\nOn Monday June 26, Prague Airport received more than 80 pasty-faced Imperial College students,\nstill clinging protectively to their\ninstrument cases, whilst grappling\nthrough luggage for sun cream and\nshades. No amount of weeks basking in Hyde Park after exams had\nprepared us for the glorious sunshine of Prague.\nImpeccable travel instructions\nand pocket Prague guides meant\nthat even collisions between trams\nand JCBs couldn\u2019t prevent us from\narriving intact, excited and enthusiastic to sample the delights the\nCzech capital had to offer.\nNext morning we were off again\nto our next destination, the delightful Spa town of Pod\u00eabrady. Unfortunately the weather turned against\nus and, despite soaring tempera-tures, our first two concerts, meant\nto be open air in the Castle gardens\nof L\u00e1zesk\u00fd park, were accompanied by rain. Big Band, however,\nadmirably soldiered on through the\ndownpour, to one of our largest audiences of the tour, in a lunchtime\nconcert.\nIn our second concert, including\nMussorgsky\u2019s \u201cNight on the Bare\nMountain\u201d, Shostakovich\u2019s Symphony No. 12 and Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 \u201cIntroduction and Rondo Capriccioso\u201d\nwe were joined by solo violinist\nJohn Dickinson, an Imperial College physics graduate. Impressed\nby both our playing and \u201csense of\nteamwork\u201d the Mayor expressed\nhis gratitude and admiration for our\nhard work by giving us an exclusive\ntour of the town hall and presented\neach of us with a gift. We were particularly delighted to discover that\nthis gift contained bottles of a so far\nunidentified, intoxicating liquor.\nOur final day in Pod\u00eabrady gave\nus a great opportunity to visit the\ncastle and its beautiful gardens.\nExcited by the apparent change in\nweather we finally played outdoors,\non the specially built stage we had\nhastily been forced to abandon\ntwo nights previously. Attracting a\nmuch larger attendance, under the\nbaton of acclaimed guest conductor Debashish Chaudhuri, we performed Dvor\u00e1k\u2019s Symphony No. 9\nto an appreciative Czech audience,\nalong with the Mussorgsky.\nLater that evening, Jazz Big Band\nplayed their wettest concert ever\nbeneath the less than adequate\nprotection of golfing umbrellas. Despite the rain, Sinfonietta danced\nthe night away to the sounds of\n\u2018Franka Sinatry\u2019 and local people\nstopped to listen along the walls\noverlooking the courtyard. Jazz\nband\u2019s unfaltering dedication, despite being soaked through, was\nincredible and worthy of great cel-both in layout, interior design and\nsmell. A chamber music concert\nin Vrtbovsk\u00e1 gardens gave us all a\nchance to relax amongst the beautifully kept buildings and sculptures\noverlooking the rooftops of Prague\nwhilst supporting our fellow musicians in an imaginatively staged\nconcert of immense quality.\nPleased with the quality of all\nten concerts performed on tour\nwe joined together for a final meal.\nHaving finished the tour on such\na high I am sure no one will doubt\nthat it was a tremendous success.

At last! The time to\nthrow off the shackles of mum and\ndad, to let your hair down and to\nP-A-R-T-Y! There\u2019s nobody there to\ntell you what to eat, or when to eat\nit, no one to ask you \u2018where do you\nthink you\u2019re going?\u2019 or to ask you\nwhat time you\u2019re coming back. But\nbest of all, no one to tell you when\nto go to bed. This is university man,\nyou can sleep when you\u2019re dead!\nBut recent research published\nthis week in Science indicates that\nin fact, it may be those who socialise\nthe most who need the most sleep.\nIndrani Ganguly-Fitzgerald and\nher team at the Neurosciences\nInstitute in San Diego, California,\nstudied the sleeping habits of the\nfruit fly Drosophila in various social\nsituations. They discovered that\nflies that lived in groups needed\nsignificantly more sleep than those\nwho were kept in isolation, and the\nincreased requirement for sleep\nwas correlated with the size of the\ngroup.\nAlthough the importance of sleep\nwas first indicated in the early \u201980s,\nwhen rats prevented from sleeping\ndropped dead dramatically after\ntwo weeks, it has not been until\nrecent years that the complicated\nmolecular basis of sleep has begun\nto be unravelled. Drosophila, although not mammals, are increasingly used as models for studies\ninto the genetic basis of sleep due\nto their surprisingly human like\nbehaviour.\nFruit flies can sleep up to 15 hours\na day, usually in one nocturnal\nburst, and remove themselves from\ntheir social counterparts to feed\nand groom before tucking themselves into bed. Like a sleepy student on a Monday morning, those\nflies who have slept the longest are\nhardest to wake, and they too try to\ncatch up on lost shuteye, although\nlike humans Drosophila only seem\nto able to make up 30-40% of a \u2018sleep\ndebt\u2019.\nMost importantly however, both\nhumans and Drosophila appear to\nshare the molecular mechanisms\nof sleep, making discoveries easily transferable to human sleep\nresearch, with antihistamines also\nmaking the fruit fly drowsy and unsafe to operate heavy machinery,\nand caffeine keeping them up all\nnight.\nSo what do these new results\nmean? Is social activity so exhausting that you need to rest more to\nrecover? Should the social mayhem\nof Fresher\u2019s week be reduced to\nlights out at 10pm with a nice mug\nof cocoa? And why? The answer\nmay lie in the idea of \u2018synaptic plasticity\u2019, the process of making new\nconnections between neurons in\nthe brains, which is believed to be\nclosely linked to sleep.\nPreviously, all sleep research in\nDrosophila has focussed on differ-Krystyna Larkham\nScience Editor\nential levels of gene expression in\nthe sleeping/waking state. However, in June of this year, Nature published a report showing that when\nelectrical activity was blocked in\nthe areas of the Drosophila brain\nlinked to remembering smell was,\nflies slept for much shorter peri-ods, suggesting what any frantically cramming student will know-that sleep is needed to consolidate\nmemory.\nTo Ganguly-Fitzgerald, the connection is clear. The social flies in\nthe study \u2018mate, they fight. They\nform memories about the interactions they\u2019ve had, and they make\ndescisions\u2019. And then, they sleep.\nIsolated flies, and those with reduced sensory input (blinded, or\nwith a reduced sense of smell) both\nreceived less information during\nthe day, and accordingly, required\nfewer hours of sleep to commit\ntheir experiences to memory.\nUnfortunately for freshers, the\nimplications are clear. You might\nbe going out every night and dancing the night away with that hot\ngirl from your 9 o\u2019clock, but it is\nnot you, but nerdy Norman down\nthe corridor who has not ventured\nfrom his room since day one who\nwill remember what her name is.\nAnd more importantly, we finally\nhave an explanation for the inverse\nrelationship between number of\npeople met and ability to remember all their names, where they\ncome from, what A-levels they did,\nwhat they did on their gap year\u2026\nBut sadly, science still has no way\nof stopping them from telling you\nagain and again and again.\n\n"

    "content": "O2 Wireless Festival\nHyde Park\nSunday June 25\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nMuch was said in the build-up to\nthis album\u2019s release; speculation\nwas endless as to what Muse could\ndo next. The band were quoted as\nsaying they had been inspired by\nThe Strokes and their sense of mel-ody. Some fans were worried that\nthe band would lose their identity\nand \u2018sell-out\u2019 to the stereotypical\nmainstream indie crowd, but this\nwas not to be the case. While this\nalbum may be more accessible to\nthe mainstream listener the band\nhave most certainly not lost any of\ntheir edge. If anything, this album\nproves them to be the true innovators they have only hinted at being\nin the past.\nTheir last album, Absolution, released to critical acclaim and commercial success, carried a central\ntheme of apocalyptic events and\nconspiracy theories. Instead of continuing this trend and making Absolution Mk II, as many lesser bands\nwould have, the band have used elements from their earlier sound and\ntaken them to a new level.\nAs the first single, Supermassive Black Hole has proven, the\nband are not afraid of experimenting with their sound, but they took\ngreat risks in doing so. By changing their sound so completely to\nthis new disco-funk inspired style\nMuse\nBlack Holes And Revelations\n(Wea)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nalbum reviews\nA summery regression\nFelix gets retrospective over some albums releases in the summer (we need to play catch up)\nThe Automatic\nNot Accepted Anywhere\n(B-Unique)\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nGogol Bordello\nGypsy Punks:\nUnderdog World Strike\n(Side One Dummy)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nI think that what I am about to say\nwill you give some idea as to how\nI feel about this band. If you have\nnot heard Gogol Bordello\u2019s latest\nalbum Gypsy Punks: Underdog\nWorld Strike, go and buy it now and\nenjoy. Tired of listening to endless\nindie-pop bands, which it seems are\nbecoming increasingly blander as\nmore and more hat-wearing, pointy\nshoe, skinny jean wearing bands\nshoot to stardom? Then this bizarre\nfusion of gypsy folk and punk is the\nperfect antidote.\nThe music snobs amongst you\nmay dismiss them as a cheap gimmick with silly songs, however you\ncan\u2019t argue with the reaction of\nthe crowd when you see them live.\nTheir credibility is further boosted\nby the fact that this is their fifth al-bum, with their first in 1999, and the\nfact that they have featured on the\nU.S. Warped Tour. Their songs may\nseem nonsensical, reflected in song\ntitles such as Start Wearing Purple\nand Immigrant Punk. However if\nyou can listen to this album without making slightly strange movements in time to any of the songs,\nthen there is something wrong with\nyou. This music is so refreshing\nand unusual; the frantic playing of\nthe fiddle and accordion used in so\nmany of their songs adds to the excitement and chaos created by the\ncrazy lyrics and piercing, intermittent shrieks.\nTheir unique sound can be attributed to Gogol Bordello being\nlargely made up of Eastern-European immigrants, now based and\nliving in New York. Their influences\nare accredited to a wide range of\nbands, most of which I\u2019m not afraid\nto say, I have never heard of, as I\nam evidently not an alternative/ob-scure music-buff. However, I would\nrecommend this album to absolutely anybody who likes listening\nto haphazard, vibrant and revitalizing music. A far cry from what the\nBritish music scene is threatening\nto become.\nJenny Gibson\nMost people\u2019s first taste of The Automatic would probably have been\nwith their hugely successful single\nMonster. This was mine anyway,\nand if I\u2019m being honest I enjoyed\nthe rather fun, catchy and shouty\nnature of the song, accompanied by\nan entertainingly comical video, of\nyou guessed it, them being chased\nby a monster. However, the novelty\nof the raspy shouts repeating the\nend of every line becomes incredibly irritating, when you realise that\nsomebody, somewhere decided that\nit would be a good idea to use this\ntechnique on virtually every song\non The Automatic\u2019s debut album\nNot Accepted Anywhere.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I do actually like this welsh band and I enjoy what they are trying to do. My\nfavourite track is Lost at Home\nsimply because they have refrained\nfrom using any shouty-sections, although admittedly I was just waiting for them to be introduced. Their\nother tracks which have been released as singles are also included\non this album. Raoul and Recover,\nwhich has been re-released after its\nlimited success as their first ever\nsingle have both received moderate\nsuccess however obviously Monster\nwas what got The Automatic their\nbig break. These tracks along with\nMonster are very catchy, possibly\nexplaining the excessive amounts\nthe band risked losing their main\nfanbase, who knew and loved them\nfor their harder space-rock work.\nAt first many fans, myself included,\nwere bemused by this direction but\nalthough it is a radical departure it\nis also completely brilliant and tremendous fun.\nMuch of the rest of the album\nfollows suit and yet it is still much\nmore varied than their other ones.\nStand out tracks include Map of the\nProblematique which combines a\nthrobbing beat and pulsating guitars with emotional, heartfelt lyrics\nlike, \u2018Why can\u2019t we see, when we\nbleed we bleed the same\u2019. Another\nhighlight is the politically charged\nAssassin which kicks into action\nwith crushing guitars and thrashing drums while encouraging a revolution with Bellamy\u2019s lyrics, \u2018Aim,\nshoot, kill your leaders\u2019.\nOverall the album is a much easier listen than previous efforts and\nthe diversity of the songs ensure\nthat the listener is never bored.\nThe album is closed by the epic\nKnights of Cydonia which romps\nand riffs its way through six minutes of pomp and spectacle before\nburning out. At the end you are left\nwith one hell of a catchy riff stuck\nin your head, and an impression of\nslight disorientation. Like an impressive and varied fireworks display that goes out with that big loud\none leaving your ears ringing and\nyour retinas scarred, this album\nis great fun and as long as it\u2019s not\ntaken too seriously a superb album\nall round.\nToby Prudden\nof radioplay that this band receives.\nThe band do produce interesting,\nand somewhat refreshing songs,\nhowever they are all so similar that\nwhen combined they form an album that at best can be described\nas mediocre.\nApparently the band is called The\nAutomatic as they provide the perfect cure to the automatic, monotonous lives that far too many people\nlead. However, surely if you just replace one repetitive task with a tediously droning noise of an album,\nyou get that same bored feeling and\nthat is exactly what The Automatic\nhave achieved. Individually the\nsongs are quite good, but they seem\nto be limited resulting in an album\nthat sounds all too similar.\nJenny Gibson\nfestival review\nThe final day of this year\u2019s O2 wireless festival opens with a set from\nOK Go. With \u2018get, get, get over it\u2019\ninevitably fixed in our heads like\na piece of barbed cheese, we wonder around for more sounds. We\nfind London\u2019s own New Young\nPony Club (formerly NYPC), who\nstart their set with The Get Go, the\njumped up punk-funk brings life\ninto this Sunday afternoon.\nThe quirky front woman, Tahita,\nis relaxed and charming, bantering with the audience, and betting\nthat we can\u2019t help but dance to the\nJamaican reggae groove of Hiding\non the Staircase. She has a point.\nThe crowd know how to embrace\nvariety.\nAfter a bit of a wander around,\nwe come back to the X Stage to find\nNew York\u2019s Matisyahu (Matthew\nPaul Miller), bounding around the\nstage to push some Hasidic Jewish reggae into our ears. Looking at\nease as the crowd builds to follow\nthe hype that forms a fog around\nhim. You just want to sway to the\nbeat-boxing dubbed up Rasta roots\nsound.\nSunday sunshine doesn\u2019t provide\nthe purring intimacy that Alison\nGoldfrapp demands. We only catch\ntwo Goldfrapp Songs, but we\u2019re biding time as Gang of Four are due to\nheadline the Xfm Stage so we move\nswiftly on. The X Stage is barely half\nfull as some punters have twigged\nthat Niteversions are another incarnation of Soulwax. Their set of\ndancebeats crafted out of percussion and knob twiddling just builds\nthe rhythm of our anticipation. As\nthey finish the audience melts away.\nAre these people stupid? Or are we\nat the wrong stage? A band formed\nin \u201977 that smashed up a sold out\nBrixton Academy in 2004 and now\nthere\u2019s 30 of us in this crowd. Their\nloss is our gain. We move in closer\nand amazingly, we're at the front.\nThey don\u2019t disappoint. Gill leaps\nontothestagefirstprancingaround\nlike a sprite, King\u2019s bashing his\npercussion instrument of choice,\na microwave, with a baseball bat.\nHere\u2019s the intensity of sound we\u2019ve\nwaited for, what some have called\ntheir neo-Marxist funk. Call it what\nyou want, it was a set of classics.\nClearly enjoying themselves and it\nrubs off on the crowd.\nWe are moved beyond words and\nall we can do to pogo uncontrollably and grin. Their set is the highlight of the day. As Gang of Four\ncome off-stage, we rush over to the\nmain stage for headliners, Depeche\nMode.\nThe crowd has significantly expanded since we left Goldfrapp's\nset. We are barely settled and the\ntallest man in the vicinity positions\nhimself directly in front of us. His\nmate, probably the second tallest\nman in the whole crowd, stands\nnext to him. That was very considerate we thought before shifting\nbehind some normal sized people.\nThey\u2019re playing all the hits flawlessly and we wonder why it doesn\u2019t\nfeel like the headlining act of one of\nour favourite bands.\nSuddenly everything changes.\nHere comes Personal Jesus. The\nsun starts to set, the huge screens\nshine out beautiful pictures and\nfrom nowhere, the atmosphere finally arrives. Now it feels like the\nheadline set of a festival.\nWhen Dave Gahan utters the\nwords,\u2018Come on lets see those\nhands,\u2019 the crowd obeys. They\nplayed the hits, but these were\nthe songs that we needed to hear:\nStripped; Personal Jesus; I Feel\nYou and finishing on Never Let Me\nDown Again. A draining yet exhilarating end to the day, we faithfully\nwent and bought Depeche Mode\nT-shirts.\nMia Kukathason &\nHeba Abu-Own Depeche Mode live with very strange keyboards in background\nYour humble newspaper attends the O2 Wireless festival for an eclectic mix of bands\nDepeche Mode and others impress at Hyde Park\n16\nfelix\nThursday 28 September 2006\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "London School of Excess\nLSE has nicer girls than IC? Surely not!\nAlthough there are better things\nI can think of doing for a night out\nthan spending it with a load of econ-omists, it has to be said that LSE\u2019s\nunion is certainly enviable. It\u2019s pop-ular, they have leather seats, multiple floors, more of the female gen-der, and it\u2019s even a little cheaper.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. Bastards. Don\u2019t let anything put you off\ngoing, though, because one of the\nall round best outings in London\nis one of their flagship nights, on\nthe pleasingly convenient Saturday\nslot. There\u2019s also a big clubnight on\nFridays called Crush, but it\u2019s best\nnot to mention my experience with\nthat one (it involved pouring alcohol down my ears to drown out that\nhorrendous noise people call urban\n\u2018music\u2019).\nAfterskool has been going for a\nwhile now, and it describes itself as\nan indie and electro night. Amongst\nthe usual suspects, there\u2019s a certain\nNew Wave influence amongst it all,\nwith the likes of Talking Heads and\nDavid Bowie rearing their heads\nfor the dancefloor once again.\nThere, are of course, your usual\nindie anthems which they pump\nout through the speakers, expect\nto hear something like Love Will\nTear Us Apart or Common People at some point or another, most\nlikely towards the end of the night.\nThere\u2019s also your standard selection of relatively new and dance-able indie hits; The Arcade Fire\nare certainly popular, and whether\nyou like them or not, there\u2019s the\nseemingly omnipresent Franz Ferdinand with their various remixes\nto keep you throwing funky shapes\n(although, readers, I must say whoever did that remix of the first 3\nnotes of Do You Want To that lasts\nabout 13 minutes will pay for leg injury for dancing too long, I fucking\nswear). A lot of the night concentrates on the stuff the NME indie\nkids listen to, I\u2019m talking We Are\nScientists and the like, it\u2019s not really as heavy as Club NME [Hardly\nsurprising \u2013 Greg] on that side but\nit certainly veers more on the mainstream than a lot of the more elitist places in London. It may sound\na bit strange to criticize a night of\nit, but personally I do feel that Afterskool sometimes skimps a bit on\nthe electronic side of their moniker\n\u2013 there\u2019s a fair bit of 80s stuff that\nhas synthesizers, but don\u2019t get your\nhopes up thinking you\u2019re going to\nbe having a night of dance music -this is strictly for guitar and guitar/\nelectronic hybrid stuff.\nI have this unshakeable feeling\nthat this place reminds me of the\ninfamous Mancunian venue The\nHa\u00e7ienda (if you don\u2019t know what\nthat is, then may I suggest the rather great Steve Coogan movie 24\nHour Party People). The main area\nspans two stories, and has whacking great big pillars running down\nfrom a balcony, which you can look\nover onto the dancefloor from. It\u2019s\na nice enough area if you\u2019ve had a\nfew too many pints and need somewhere to relax, as it\u2019s less hectic\nthan the main area.\nBelow hence lies the bar, which\nas I mentioned, is extraordinarily\ncheap: may the lord bless student\nunions. It\u2019s usually under two quid\nfor a pint, in fact, I\u2019ve found the rule\nof thumb is that it\u2019s about 5-10p\ncheaper than Imperial. This means\nthat, for a change, you can actually\nget drunk on something you like\nand spend as much as you would\nat an average pub, without having\nto make do with whatever piss happened to be on special offer. Panic,\nI\u2019m looking at you, with your sodding Kronenburg (however you do\nplay Belle & Sebastian loads, so I\nstill love you).\nAnd then there\u2019s the atmosphere.\nOkay, so you\u2019ll still see the occasional music elitist with stupid hair and\na ridiculous hat (guilty as charged)\nas is per usual in indie establish-ments, but Afterskool is largely full\nof \u2013 well \u2013 students! Respectable\nstudents! Not that I have anything\nbad to say about the fine ladies at\nsomewhere like, just a random\nclub, Cheapskates, but it\u2019s a somewhat fun and friendly atmosphere,\nit\u2019s not full of horny males and neither is it full of music scenesters\nthat are just too cool to dance.\nSo, it\u2019s easy to find, easy to get\nback from (you\u2019ve got to love those\nbuses in Camden at 3 in the morn-ing, that only run once an hour and\nnever go anywhere useful), a good\ntime of the week, damn cheap, and\nhas a great atmosphere. About the\nonly complaint I can level against\nthis place is that I wish it played\nmore varied music, but it\u2019s a minor\ncritique, and one I\u2019m sure won\u2019t apply to 99% of you kids out there.

Expect to hear\nan eclectic mix of Indie, Post-Punk,\nand a bit of Electro. They also have\nlive bands.\nThursday\nGet over to Candybox at Moonlighting, if you fancy a horrible night\nof Indie cheese. The questionable\nchoice of music is balanced by the\n\u00a31.00 house spirit and mixers, so\nturn up with \u00a320 and leave totally\nwasted.\nFriday\nIn the olden days before Our Disco\nwas so cruelly removed from it\u2019s\nhome at Plastic People, it would\nguarantee a decent Friday night.\nHowever there are still some commendable options, check 333 on Old\nStreet for monthly clubnights that\ncan be hit and miss, or Cargo, also\naround Old Street for a varied mix\nof live acts.\nSaturday\nAfterskool, the best student Indie clubnight in London, hosted at\nLSE\u2019s student union (see review)\nis a great option, the DJ\u2019s are good\nand the drinks are quite cheap.

    "content": "Students suspected\nin terror scare\nDoes \u201cethnic profiling\u201d help catch terrorists?\nOn the evening of August 9 this year\ncounter-terrorist officers arrested\n24 people amid accusations of an\nal-Qaida plot to blow up 10 planes\nheading for the US. Although it\nappeared that all of the suspected\nterrorists were safely behind bars,\nairport security was still massively\nincreased as an extra precaution.\nItems such as bottled drinks, mois-turiser and baby food were confis-cated; even those purchased in the\nairport duty-free shops were seen\nas a possible new kind of weapon\nof mass destruction. Only essential\nitems of hand luggage were allowed\non long-haul flights. People\u2019s fears,\nhowever, were fuelled by the threat\nof \u201cmass murder on an unimaginable scale\u201d. They were told they\nmight have been blown out of the\nsky.\nChaos at the check-in desk, especially at Heathrow, led to the deployment of an \u201cethnic profiling\u201d sys-tem, a time-saving method in which\nonly the passengers that looked\nmost like potential terrorists were\nsubjected to the most thorough security checks. Young Asian males\nwere on the top of the list of potential targets for scrutiny; they are\nseen as statistically more likely to\nThe attempted terrorist attack this summer has lead to the\nintroduction of \u2018people-profiling\u2019 to catch suspected terrorists\nIn depth: Gordon Brown at conference\nOver the past week Manchester has\nplayed host to the Labour party con-ference, the traditional warm-up for\npolitical parties before the main political season. Before it started we\nhad already been told that this conference would be the last one under\nTony Blair\u2019s premiership. All eyes\nare on his right-hand man, Gordon\nSocial Democrat or Democratic Socialist? Not much difference now\nCamilla Royle become suicide bombers based on\nthe evidence of the five years since\n9/11. Even Claude Moraes, Labour\nMEP for London, was stopped and\nsearched twice over the summer.\nThe profiling scheme was criticised\nby Chief Superintendent Ali Dizael,\nsaying that it created a new offence\nof \u201ctravelling while Asian\u201d. He objected to the scheme, saying that\nit was not only unfair to innocent\nAsians and Muslims but also that\nthe scheme \u201cdoes not work or can\nbe counter-productive\u201d, detracting the focus away from real terrorists that don\u2019t fit the profile and\nmaking those that do the target for\nracist abuse. The case was quietly\ndropped after the arrested people\nwere cleared of charges. None of\nthem had booked flights and some\ndid not even have passports.\nSince the scare, a number of individuals have been treated as sus-pect. In Malaga two Pakistani students were removed from a plane\non a flight to Manchester where\nthey both study at Manchester University. The men alerted the suspicions of other passengers by speaking what one person assumed was\nArabic and keeping themselves\ncovered up so that they stood out in\na crowd of holiday-makers in shorts\nand T-shirts. The same instincts\nthat alerted people to the presence\nof suicide bomber Hasib Hussain\nfiddling with his rucksack on a bus\non July 7 last year caused the students to be taken away. They were\nheld back for security checks as\nthe plane left without them. However, this time, when those instincts\nwere acted on, they proved to be\nfalse. Another flight from Gatwick\nto Hurghada in Egypt ended with\nan emergency landing in Italy after\na passenger said that he had found\na note in his seat pocket saying that\nthere was a bomb on the plane.\nEthnic profiling overtly associates\nterrorism in the 21st century with\nsome religious groups more than\nothers and applies different rules\nto different people. It therefore emphasises perceived differences between cultures in the same way as\nthe pope\u2019s recent comments about\nIslam have been seen as a sincere\nattempt to break the bridges built\nby his predecessor, John Paul II, by\nsome Vatican commentators.\nWhether justified or not, Islamophobia could become just as much\na part of flying as claustrophobia\nand aviatophobia. Acts of terrorism\nare intended to influence and cause\ndistress within a society rather\nthan merely kill civilians. It seems\nthat in this case that goal has been\nachieved even if no real terrorists\nwere ever involved.\nBrown, the man tipped to succeed\nBlair for the leadership. Gordon\ngave his keynote speech on Monday\nregarding the state of the economy,\nbut it also revealed what some of\nGordon Brown\u2019s key policies would\nbe if he became leader.\nHis main direction became crys-tal-clearearlyoninthespeech,how-ever, when he praised Tony Blair for\nrunning a party for \u201call of society\u201d.\nThe \u201call\u201d in this case, however, is\nnot the working-class it traditionally supports, but, as Gordon put it,\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be pro Labour, we\u2019ve\ngot to be pro business too\u201d. This is\na worrying precedent, considering\nhe\u2019s following a leader who claims\nto be the leader of the party of the\npeople, yet who invited Thatcher\naround to Number 10 for policy dis-cussion. Recently we have seen the\nproposed selling off of NHS logistics to private companies and the\ncreation of \u2018Trust Schools\u2019 where\nan outside organisation, including\ncompanies, can dictate what ethos\nthe school takes. It seems that with\nall these plans to be \u2018pro-business\u2019\nhe\u2019s putting the rest of society at\nrisk; a lot of people are still angry at\nthe failure of rail privatisation and\nsuch a continuation of this ethic\ncan have disastrous consequences,\ndespite Gordon\u2019s reassurances that\nhe wants to end \u201ca Britain of \u2018no\nsuch thing as society\u2019\u201d, reversing\nThatcher\u2019s famous comments.\nGordon Brown actively wants\nto follow the line set by Tony Blair\non the world-famous \u201cWar on Terror\u201d, supporting identity cards and\nan extension of 28 days detention\nfor terrorist suspects \u2018if evidence\nshows it necessary\u2019. Both policies\nwere widely criticised for being\nheavy-handed and counterproduc-tive. He also supported the \u2018global-cooperation\u2019 in the war against\nterrorism and called for a stop in\n\u2018anti-Americanism\u2019, showing a continuing willingness to toe America\u2019s\nline on global policy.\nFurther into his speech, Gordon\nBrown did give ideas of how to improve social security and build on\nwhat can be seen as some of Labour\u2019s main achievements during\nits tenure. Gordon championed the\nimmediateincreaseoftheminimum\nwage and the legislation of \u2018corporate manslaughter\u2019 where companies can be liable if poor regulations\ncause the death of their workers.\nThe latter piece of legislation has\nbeen discussed for ages but has yet\nto be created, so any serious laws\nformed under Gordon Brown would\nbe widely received; this is one of his\nmain challenges he should attempt\nto overcome. There are also calls\nto \u201cchampion youth councils and\nyouth budgets\u201d, where young people get a major say in how money\nis spent on them in their local area.\nThose who think that this is a move\naway from issuing ASBO\u2019s should\nthink again, as there is a rally to \u201cbe\ntough\u201d on youth crime.\nEducation has been one of Gordon\nBrown\u2019s more controversial areas,\nwith the introduction of tuition fees\n(and then top-up fees) to cover the\ncosts of increased higher education\nintake. Although Gordon aims to\nincrease government spending on\nstate schools (from \u00a35.5K per pupil to \u00a38K, to match \u201ctoday\u2019s level\nfor private school pupils\u201d), which\nis more than welcome if it goes\nahead, he also has a vision of ensuring that everyone is educated up to\nthe age of 18 (whether \u201cpart-time\nor \u201cfull-time\u201d). Along with touting\nAlan Johnson\u2019s proposal to \u201cgive\nvocational qualifications parity of\nesteem with academic qualifications\u201d, he runs the risk of stretching the educational system for further education and denying money\nto where it is needed most; which\nwas one of the contributing factors\nto the introduction to tuition fees.\nOn a global scale Gordon Brown\nintroduces some progressive plans\nwith the outcome of making Britain a leading force in international\nrelations. The UN must \u201curgently\u201d\nact on Darfur (again, action which\nis long overdue) and asks for further international cooperation\nwhen it comes to combating climate change. However, he warns,\nthis should not lead to \u201cenvironmental colonialism\u201d where richer\ncountries dominate poorer counterparts by providing all the relvent\ninfrastructure. Instead he proposes\nthat the World Bank set up a $20\nbillion fund for poorer countries,\nto encourage their own societies to\ncombat climate change.\nGordon Brown\u2019s speech to the\nLabour conference highlights his\nplans to increase global and social\nsecurity; whilst these are an important and major step forward which\nimprove on Labour successes, the\nfact that being keen on pushing\nforward with controversial (and un-welcome) policies such as continuing the current line on the war on\nterror (which isn\u2019t helped by keeping quiet on Trident in this speech)\nruns the risk of losing the next\nelection, especially in the face of\na Conservative resurgance under\nDavid Cameron. The main question for Gordon Brown now is will\nhe listen to those who opposed the\nIraq war and private finance initia-tives? Otherwise he\u2019ll find out that\nhis new reign will be a very short\none indeed.\nMatthew Hartfield\nPolitics Editor\n4\nfelix\nThursday 28 September 2006\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Sabbaticals to be sued?\nThree sabbatical officers of the Union have been sent an official letter\nfrom a Hong Kong solicitors\u2019 office\nthreatening legal action unless a\ndecision to suspend the Chinese\nSociety over alleged financial irregularities is reversed.\nOn Saturday September 23, as the\nsabbs were gearing up for officer\ntraining out at Wye, they received\nan e-mail from Wong & Co solicitors,\nwho are acting on behalf of Miss\nEmily Chow, the current Chair of\nChinese Society. The letter was addressed to the former Union President, Sameena Misbahuddin, the\ncurrent President, John Collins, as\nwell as Eric Lai (Deputy President,\nClubs & Societies) and Jon Matthews (Deputy President, Finance\n& Services). The letter disputes\nthe recent decision to suspend the\nChinese Society and deny them a\nstall at Freshers\u2019 Fair after various\nfinancial irregularities regarding\nthe sale of membership and the disappearance of money made from\nevents came to light, calling it \u201centirelywithoutmerits,non-substanti-ated [sic] and accordingly invalid\u201d.\nThe deadline set by the solicitors\nfor the reversal of this suspension\nis today, five days from the sending\nof the letter, leaving the sabbs only\nthree working days to reply. The letter threatens that unless the decision is reversed, the solicitors will\n\u201cinstruct [their] client\u2019s legal agent\nin the UK to exhaust every possible\nlegal means in redressing the unfairness and grievances including\nbut not limited to seeking injunctive\nrelief\u2026from a UK court\u201d, as well as\nholding the sabbs responsible for\nany legal costs or incidental losses\nthat might be suffered by ICCS.\nAccording to records available on\nthe Imperial College Union finance\nwebsite, which lists all the budgets\nand transactions of clubs and soci-eties, the Chinese Society banked\n\u00a3500 in membership money from\none hundred members, with membership costing \u00a35. However, it has\nrecentlycometolightthattheSocie-ty has been selling multi-year memberships to its members for \u00a310.\nThe student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,357 \u2022 Thursday \u2022\n28 September 2006 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nAs Mr Matthews stated in an e-mail\nto the President of Chinese Society,\nEmily Chow, and the treasurer, Wai\nWong, this is \u201cwholly unacceptable\nand against Union policy\u201d. Membership to clubs can only be sold\nto members or life members of the\nUnion, and should a student fail\nto complete their course of study\nand forfeit membership of the Union, they cannot be members of\nany clubs or societies, rendering\nmulti-year memberships unfeasi-ble. The evidence for this has come\ndirectly from society members contacted by Mr Lai, several of whom\nhave confirmed that they were sold\nmulti-year memberships for \u00a310. As\nnone of this \u2018extra\u2019 money has been\nbanked into the Chinese Society\u2019s\naccount, this raises the question of\nwhat has happened to it. If this money has been deposited in an external bank account, the Society may\nbe held responsible for withholding\nfunds, which may be construed as\ntheft, and VAT fraud, as a result of\noperating a second bank account to\ntake membership money on which\nVAT would not have been paid.\nThis is not the first time the society has run into trouble with their\nfinances. At last year\u2019s Freshers\u2019\nFair, it was found to be taking membership money from prospective\nmembers, in express violation of\nUnion rules. Nearly \u00a3700 was confiscated from the society\u2019s stall after the breach was discovered. The\nsociety has also been warned on\nprevious occasions about the selling of multi-year memberships. In\naddition, the society is currently in\nalmost \u00a31,900 in debt.\nFelix has obtained copies of emails sent between the parties, and\na copy of the solicitors\u2019 letter. Mr\nMatthews and Mr Lai contacted\nMiss Chow and her treasurer via\ne-mail at the start of August, when\nthe irregularities came to light. As\nthis took place during the summer\nvacation, Miss Chow requested\nthat the issue be resolved using email or over the telephone. Mr Matthews subsequently informed Miss\nChow by e-mail on August 7 that\nContinued on page 2\nAbove (clockwise): Emily Chow, Chair of IC Chinese Society; Eric Lai, Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties); John Collins, Union President; John Matthews, Deputy President (Finance & Services).\nBelow: The two Facebook posts made by Miss Chow during her alleged stay at a spiritual retreat.\n4\nIn depth:\nGordon\nBrown at\nconference\nScience\n5\nFeature: IC Entrepreneurs\n6\nPolitics\n\n"

First and foremost\nin Mr Collin\u2019s Governance Review,\nwhich totals more than one hundred pages, is the introduction of a\n\u201cUnion Court\u201d. The Court\u2019s role is\nto ensure that the Union Constitution is obeyed by Exec, the President and Council, to investigate\nelection disputes, and to act as an\nultimate authority for media com-plaints. In the past, election complaints have been investigated by\nCouncil, which can lead to political\nvoting on candidates. Who would sit\non the Court is still being debated,\nthough initial proposals suggested\nex-Union Officers and alumni with\na suitably \u2018hacky\u2019 interest in the\nUnion; no currently serving officers\nwould be eligible to stand.\nCouncil is also on the President\u2019s\nhitlist, with the stated aim of making it more of a \u201cRepresentatives\u2019\nAssembly\u201d. This includes the removal of all non Executive \u201cmanagers\u201d; namely the Clubs & Societies\nChairs, the RAG, CAG, Welfare and\nEqual Opportunities officers. These\nseats will be replaced with Ordinary\nMembers elected from the student\npopulation. Though some questions have been raised concerning\nthe make-up of Ordinary Members,\nwith the possibility of hacks stacking in Council, in the past the Ordinary Members have come mostly\nfrom members of clubs and socie-ties, ensuring that the clubs will\nretain significant representative\npower in Council.\nThe Student Activities Committee (SAC) will be broken into two\nhalves: the first half, the Clubs\nActivities Board (CAB), would be\nresponsible for running the \u2018club\nstuff\u2019 of the SAC, and be attended\nby CSCs and Faculty Union officers;\nthe second half, the Representation\nand Welfare Board (RWB), would\ntake up the SAC\u2019s welfare role. The\naim is to move the \u201cmanagement\u201d\nofficers from Council to what the\nreview refers to as \u201cdoing committees\u201d. Some are unhappy with this\narrangement, suggesting that this\nwill shift the balance of power significantly to welfare as opposed to\nclubs and societies. With around\n80% of Imperial students participating in clubs and societies, they are\noften the most visible and important aspect of the Union\u2019s services\nto its members. The worry is that\nthe SAC\u2019s budget will be divided\namongst the CAB and the RWB,\nwith more money being allocated\nto welfare than in previous years,\nresulting in more cuts to the clubs\nbudget. Mr Collins has assured this\nreporter that \u201cthere will be no cuts\nto clubs\u201d should the proposals to\nbreak up the SAC be accepted at\nCouncil.\nAmong the more controversial\nsuggestions are a battery of measures to ensure the accountability of\nthe Sabbaticals to the student body.\nThese suggestions are no doubt\nprompted by the farcical behaviour\nof the Union Officers and Felix towards the previous incumbent of\nthe Deputy President (Graduate\nServices) post, Luis Hui, after he\nwent on record stating that \u201cthere\nare no welfare issues facing postgraduates\u201d. The issue of removing two-year Sabbaticals has been\nraised yet again, though the it will\nlikely be debated at Council early\nthis year.\nThe initial, \u201cphase one\u201d propos-als, including the formation of the\nCourt and the SAC break-up, will be\npresented before Council as individual packages, and the consensual recommendations presented as\na package. The changes to Council\nwill not be debated until next year.\nWye development halted\nWork on Imperial College\u2019s planned\ndevelopment of a Science Park at\nWye has been halted, according to\na statement made by the Deputy\nRector, Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, on\nSeptember 15th.\nThe statement says that Sir\nLeszek would be recommending\nthat the College does not continue\nany further investigation into \u201cdelivering a world-class research\ncentre, science hub and associated\nhousing\u201d at the Wye Campus.\nThe story has been followed closely by the protest website save-wye.\norg. The site was founded by two\nresidents of Wye: David Hewson, a\njournalist who has worked for The\nTimes, The Independent, and the\nSunday Telegraph, and Justin Williams, the assistant editor at the\nSunday Telegraph. Their statement\nwas slightly less restrained than Sir\nLeszek\u2019s:\n\u201cWye Park is dead, our job is\ndone\u201d read their front page.\nThe statement gave the reason\nfor abandoning the development,\nwhich would have provided more\nthan 12,500 jobs to the local area, as\nnone of the scenarios for the campus presenting a \u201cwise, viable or de-Safer Neighbourhood Team\nto be sited at the College\nImperial College is to house the\nSafer Neighbourhood Team for the\nlocal election ward in the basement\nof the Sherfield Building.\nThe Safer Neighbourhood Teams\nare part of a countrywide initiative\nto provide community-level polic-ing, with the teams consisting of six\nofficers and community service of-ficers. They provide a visible police\npresence in a local area, and allow\nlocal people to talk to the Team to\nlet them know the day-to-day issues\nthat are bothering them.\nThe officers will man the office in\nCollege some of the day, and will be\nwalking a beat between the College\nand up to Belgravia and the surrounding area. Neil Denney, one of\nthe officers, stressed that the Team\nare not there to police students, and\nthat there will be no stopping and\nsearching of students on campus.\nHaving a close feedback with police\nwill aid College Security in matters such as bike theft from around\ncampus. You can contact them at\npolice@imperial.ac.uk. The Team\nare also helping co-ordinate extra\nsecurity for freshers arriving over\nthe weekend. Terry Branch, Chief\nSecurity Officer, said: \u201cour aim is\nzero early thefts from around halls\nof residences\u201d. They plan to run\nregular \u2018surgeries\u2019 where students\ncan talk to the officers about any\ncrime issues, as well as pick up\ncrime prevention leaflets.\nLeft to right: PC John Roberts, Tony Beckett (Civic Watch), PCSO\nSarah Levitt, PCSO Martin Robson, Naomi Simpson (Civic Watch),\nSgt Gary Herrett, Terry Branch (IC Security), Leroy Adedji (Civic\nWatch), PC Neil Denney, Tony Mwaitenda (IC Security)\nUnion building project\nfaces several setbacks\nsirable investment of public funds\nfor Imperial College and Wye\u201d.\nIn July, BP began running adverts in a number of publications\nthat said that they were planning\nto build a \u00a3500m biofuels research\ninstitute in partnership with a uni-versity, with Imperial College being one of those approached by the\nfuel giant. This cast a shadow over\nthe continued development of Wye\nPark; should BP choose to build\ntheir institute in partnership with a\nBritish University, it would be very\ndifficult to convince the government that another major biofuels\nresearch centre would be required.\nSave-wye reported that Imperial\nCollege was on BP\u2019s shortlist.\nWhen suggestions about BP funding part of the Wye project were\nfloated at a meeting of Wye elected\nrepresentatives, Sir Leszek referred to BP as requiring to start\nthe project by early 2007, far too\nearly for Wye Park\u2019s planning stage\nto be complete. They also reported\nthat the project was in \u201cdeep freeze\u201d\nback in July, with contractors being\npulled off the site, which was denied\nby the College at the time.\nSir Leszek thanked to the Wye\nresidents, the Parish Council, and\nelected representatives in his state-ment, saying that he had \u201cappreciated the responses that have been\nreceived\u201d.\nThe future of Wye Campus as part\nof Imperial College is solid for the\nforeseeable future. Sir Leszek said\nthat the College would continue to\nstrongly support the courses being\ntaught at Wye, especially the successful Business course, and renegotiate the Campus\u2019 status with the\nUniversity of Kent in 2011 as stated\nin 2005.\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, at the signing of the Wye Concordat\nThe Union redevelopment project\nhas hit a number of setbacks over\nthe summer vacation; though da\nVinci\u2019s will be complete for Freshers\u2019 Fair, providing somewhere for\nfreshers to drink, there are doubts\nover whether food can be served\nfrom the kitchens.\nWhile excavating a large hole\nin the central core of the building\nfor the new lift, contractors found\nasbestos. Specialist workers were\ncalled in to deal with the asbestos,\nand air tests were performed that\nconfirmed the absence of airborne\nasbestos.\nThe age of the building has been\nproviding other challenges to the\nproject. The main two floors of the\nbuilding were built in 1910, and as\nsuch, no plans exist showing the location of water pipes and electrical\ncabling. Workers managed to dig\ninto a large water pipe, flooding the\ncore, and there was a power cut to\nthe building when another excavation cut power cables.\nAs there has been a large excavation in the kitchen area of the building which has not yet been filled it,\nit is doubtful the Union will be able\nto serve food for the first week.\nConcerns have been raised over\nthe stones artfully placed outside\nthe new glass doors to da Vinci\u2019s.\nAs they are not cemented in, they\nprovide ready window-breaking or\nSecurity-hitting ammunition should\ninbriated students become infuriated with the Union.\nThe core of the Union building, showing the lift excavation\n\n"

    "content": "Summary of this week\u2019s business news\nThe Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided\nto leave the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 per cent. The news\ncame as no surprise to economists\ngiven the fall in America\u2019s headline\nrate of inflation in August by more\nthan expected. This was largely\ndue to decelerated energy inflation,\nwhich was 0.3 per cent in August\ncompared with 2.9 per cent in July.\nThe regulation of hedge funds\nwas brought into question after\na Connecticut based firm \u2013 Amaranth Advisors \u2013 lost billions of dollars because of bad positions in the\nnatural-gas futures market. Investment bank Goldman Sachs speculates the losses could reach 65 per\ncent of the entire fund. Christopher\nCox, the head of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC)\nwarned individual investors of the\nhigh risks potentially pertaining to\nhedge funds.\nJPMorgan Securities Japan lost\nmillions of dollars on Tuesday due\nto an erroneous sell order on the\nTokyo Stock Exchange. Similar incidences have plagued the exchange\nin the past, including the high-profile bad trade made by Muziho\nSecurities that resulted in shares\nbeing mistakenly sold for a Yen. In\nthis case, however, the TSE spotted\nan unusual trade in advance and\nwarned JPMorgan. As a result only\na small proportion of the trade went\nthrough. The firm released a statement admitting it had sold a group\nof stocks in the Topix index instead\nof stocks in the Nikkeir 225. JPMorgan refused to put a figure on the\nlosses.\nEurope and Japan heavily criticised the anticompetitive actions\nof Russia, which withdraw a permit on environmental grounds.\nThe permit was necessary for a $20\nbillion Royal Dutch Shell energy-project. The action has increased\nthe chances of Gazprom \u2013 Russia\u2019s\nstate-owned gas monopoly \u2013 claiming the project as its own.\nThe European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS)\nannounced further setbacks in\nthe production of the Airbus A380,\nputting pressure on its share price.\nNo specific details were given, but a\nreview is expected soon.\nBill Ford, chairman of automotive\ngiant Ford, has employed the services of Sir John Bond \u2013 Vodafone\u2019s\nchairman and former chairman of\nHSBC. He will act as a part-time\nfinancial consultant to Mr Ford.\nAfter an uncertain year, investors\nshowed renewed faith after the unveiling of plans to close two plants\nand cut 10,000 white-collar jobs.\nScania, a Swedish lorry manu-facturer, rejected a takeover bid\nfrom MAN, a German competitor.\nVolkswagen, the leading share-holder, believed the offer of 9.6 billion euros undervalued the com-pany, whilst Renault, with a 5 per\ncent stake in Scania, supported the\ndeal.\nDieter Zetsche, chairman of\nChrysler, predicted the company\nwould make a loss this year, contrary to analyst predictions of a profit.\nThe company will be making cuts\nin the near future and continues to\nlose its share in the North American market.\nMotorola made its largest acquisition since 2000 after agreeing to\nbuy Symbol Technologies for $3.9\nbillion. Symbol manufactures handheld devices for tracking stock\nand radio-identification tags, and\nwill broaden Motorola\u2019s logistics\ndivision.\nThe Swiss pharmaceutical company Serono, which has been\nsearching for a buyer for some time,\nis to be bought by Merk. The German rival said it would buy the 64.5\nper cent stake currently held by the\nBertarelli family for $13.3 billion.\nTelecom Italia\u2019s restructuring\nprogramme resulted in the chairman resigning over allegations of\ngovernment intervention.\nTI intended to spin off its fixed-line and mobile business so it could\nconcentrate on broadband and\nmedia services. The centre-left\ngovernment plans to oppose the\nscheme but TI is committed and\nplans to acquire AOL Broadband in\nGermany.\nCareer options in finance\nCity\nExplained\nWith the dawn of the new academic\nyear comes a new recruitment cycle and a fresh batch of undergraduates wondering what they want to\ndo for the rest of their lives between\nweekends. Many see the financial\nservices industry as intimidating or\ndry, but closer examination can reveal a dynamic, exciting and meri-tocratic working environment.\nThe most prolific employers of\nuniversity graduates are investment banks, accountancy firms, insurance and actuarial companies,\nand management consultants.\nInvestment banks offer undergraduates from all disciplines career paths to suite most tastes.\nMergers and acquisitions (M&A)\nbankers work closely with large\nmultinationals on long-term\nprojects in an attempt to efficiently\nrestructure them. Juniors - known\nas analysts - are expected to work\ninto the small hours of the morning calculating financial models or\nwriting pitch books for clients. The\nhigh pay and invaluable business\nexperience makes this an attractive choice.\nThe sales and trading departments offer slightly more sociable\nhours but the work is fast-paced\nand not for the faint hearted. Sales\npeople and traders work to bring\nbuyers and sellers of financial securities together. Despite this simple\npremise, the job can be exceptionally complicated because the trader\nmust ensure that, overall, he or she\nends up making a small margin on\neverything bought and sold whilst\nstill offering competitive prices.\nPrivate bankers or asset managers pool together the cash of\nwealthy individuals or clients such\nas pension funds. They create portfolios consisting of a range of in-vestments, from stocks to bonds to\ngold and property.\nThose with an interest in investment banking should ensure they\nhave an extensive CV with examples of teamwork and innovation,\nbecause competition is fierce. Ensure you are familiar with the industry you are interested in and the\ncompany you are applying for.\nThe large firms run summer\ninternships for those in their penultimate year of study, which you\ncan apply for online through their\nwebsites.\nIt might seem an obvious point,\nbut knowing about the company you\nare interested in is essential. A recruiter from Royal Dutch Shell re-European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company admits further setbacks in Airbus A380 production\nThe action of merging or acquiring\n(M&A) a company is far more complicated than buying most other\nassets. There are several legal, tax\nand accounting issues to be dealt\nwith. This week, we shall briefly examine these topics.\nNo matter how practicable a deal\nmay seem, competition laws must\nbe considered. No acquisition may\ntake place if the effect may be to\nsubstantially lessen competition or\ntend towards creating a monopoly.\nOnce the antitrust hurdle has\nbeen passed, the form of acquisition needs to be considered. One\nway is for a company to assume all\nthe assets and all the liabilities of\nthe other. Conducting the merger\nin this way requires the approval\nof at least 50 per cent of the stock\nholders of each firm.\nAn alternative is to simply buy the\ncompany being sold in exchange for\ncash, shares or sometimes other\nsecurities. This method does not require the approval of the seller\u2019s top\nmanagement, although it is generally sought. A hostile takeover can\nresult if they resist, in which the\nbuyer will attempt to acquire an effective majority of the outstanding\nshares. The final method is to buy\nsome or all of the seller\u2019s assets.\nThe tax status of an acquisition\ncan affect the taxes paid by the\nmerged firm. Cash deals are taxable for capital gains tax. But share\nswaps are tax-free, and the stockholders are viewed as exchanging\ntheir old shares in company A for\nsimilar new ones in company B.\nAcademics view the corporate\nmerger as a fulfilment of the economies of scale theory that stipulates\nfree markets tend towards having\nas few companies and brand names\nas possible. In summary, the theory\nargues that by merging and growing into large multinationals, companies\u2019 production costs are reduced for a number of reasons. On\na simplistic level, one example is\ndecreased production costs permitted by bulk buying. You may then\nquestion the justification and motivation for corporations in different\nlines of business merging.\nThere are fundamentally three\nkinds: the vertical, horizontal and\nconglomerate mergers. The horizontal kind combines two companies in the same line of business,\nfor example, Vodafone and German\ntelecom giant Mannesmann. The\nvertical variety involves companies at different stages of produc-tion. The buyer either expands the\ncompany back towards the source\nof raw materials, or forwards it in\nthe direction of the consumer. For\nexample, Walt Disney acquired the\nABC television network.\nThe conglomerate merger involves companies in unrelated\nfields joining forces. The justification being, that costs might be cut\nby sharing central services such as\naccounting. Nevertheless, corporations are under the influence of\nshareholders and top-management\nexecutives, leading to dubious motives for mergers.\nIn 2000 AOL acquired Time Warner. This conglomerate made corporate history with a record-breaking\n$156billionworthofstockpurchased\nby AOL to acquire Time Warner.\nThe new company promised to fulfil\nthe consumer\u2019s media and information needs. Unfortunately, profits in\nthe company slumped, resulting in\nan 80% decline in the share value.\nMichael Olymbios\nBusiness Editor\ncounted an interview where a candidate thought that the company\u2019s\nsole line of work was \u201cpetrol stations.\u201d In actual fact the retail fuel\ngarages break even. Shell makes its\nmoney by refining and transporting\ncrude oil and crude products.\nManagementconsultancyisabout\nimplementing positive changes in\ncompanies so they run more efficiently and competitively.\nIf you like the idea of solving complex problems with unique solu-tions, then this is the job for you.\nAccountants manage and analyse\nthe movement of cash within com-panies. Whether a local plumber\nor a multinational, all businesses\nneed to have financial statements\nwritten up.\nCash-flow is important for working out how much money a company makes, who it owes, who owes it\nand how much tax is owed.\nAccountants are increasingly becoming involved with strategic de-cisions, managing risk and helping\nbusinesses thrive.\nAs well as the College Careers\nService, there are student-led careers societies offering you the\nchance to attend networking events\nhosted by companies.\nAt this time of year Imperial College Finance Society (ICSF) and\nStudent Industrial Society (SIS)\nhost investment banks, accountancy and other firms, who come to\nImperial and give interactive talks\non their business areas. They also\ngive you the chance to talk to employees young and old.\nMichael Olymbios\nInterested in financial\njournalism?\nbusiness.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\n8 felix Thursday 28 September 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
