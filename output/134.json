    "content": "FEU X HALDANE OPENING THE OFFICIAL OPENING CSREHCNY\nOn the 8th May the Haldane Library\nwaa officially open,* in its new premises\nat 13 Princes Gardens. The opening\nceremony was performed by Mr. T GN Haldane, a nephew of Lord Haldane! the\nfounder.\nThe Reotor, as part of his introductory remarks said:-\"On the whole, whether they like it or not, the you nd scientists of today\nare liable to have increasingly diverse\nparts to play in life. They will become mixed up with problems of communication and of management; ( particularly as they get older); with human problems\nand with value Judgements. So, for rather practical reasons, it is important that their overall education should\nbe as broad as possible.\nIt has always seemed to me that the\nprovision of a good non-so ien ti flo library is an essential activity of a scientific institution wh i oh alas to\neducate rather than merely train. Such\na library was included in our plans for\nexp an is ion but unfortunately it came at\na rather late stage in the new buildings.\nBut when we acquired Prince's Gardens we\nhad the chance of getting a flying start\nand these roosts and this gathering today\nis the result.\"\n(left to right)\nMR. T. G.N. HALDANE, VISCOUNT FALMOUTH,\nAND THE RECTOR.\nfinally, the Rector o lose d his introduction by introducing Mr. Haldane with\nthese words:-\"It is a great pleasure that the\nopening is to be done by Mr. T. G.N. Haldane his nephew. He has been a moat valued member of the Governing\nBody for ten years. In the next room\nyou will find evidence of his keen interest and generosity, the portrait of\nhis uncle, a set of Lord Haldane's works and his biography by General\nMaurice. Tor these gifts and for what\nha will do today we thank him very\nmuch.\"\nIn reply, Mr. Haldane began by\nmentioning hi a uncle and gave some\npersonal recollections of him, which\nserved to illustrate hi a great depth of\nintellect.\nof hil9 \u00a3\u00b0Xin fuu the la at8 eot ion\" I have so frequently heard scientists and engineers complaining that the\nhigher posts, whether it be in industry,\nteaching or any other field, are so\noften reserved for those who are not\nprimarily so ien ti3ts or technologists.\nI have even heard it suggested that there\ni a a sort of conspiracy to keep scientists and engineers out of the top\npositions and give them to those who have\nre oie veda classical education. Although\nthis country has been slow to realize\nthe value of science and technology, I feel myself the explanation of the past\nfailure of scientists and engineers to\nfill the higher positions has been due\nmainly to a certain narrowness of outlook or to excessive special is ation at\ntoo early a stage. Hence the old unfortunate tendency to regard scientists\nand engineers simply as \"specialists\".\nAll the top positions necessitate a great deal of administrative work and\nmust be filled by those who can take abra od point of view. They must have\nknowledge and experience in the handling of men, as well as materials.\nI believe this narrowness of outlook is rapidly passing, and confidently expect to see very many of the highest positions filled by those who have\nbeen trained as so i anti sts and techno-logi sts, but whose knowledge and experience is not confined to so i ent if io matters only. If your Reotor will kindly not listen for a moment I would.\nlike to suggest he is a very good example of what I have in mind.\nI hope this Library, which I understand to be well s too iced with non-so i ent if io and non-te oh nio al works, will\nbe of real value in enabling you to a a mk that breadth of viewpoint wh i oh was a characteristic of the man whose name is being commemorated and I have very much\npleasure in declaring the Library open.\nThe above photograph is by Mr. P. Pmaoook.\nTRAGIC DEATH AN APPEAL\nThe college was shocked to le am of the death of a well-known figure -Mohammed Said Taha - studying here for\na Ph.D. in Geology. He died in the\nHammersmith Hospital on May 14th, being\nso unfortunate as to be fatally allergic\nto penicillin.\nOnly two students won scholarships\nin Syria to carry out studies in Geology\nin this oo un try. The other was Mr.\nJ.N. Khouri, who has written this\n\"Mohammed Said Taha, was the son of\na farmer, was bon in1923 in the small\nmarket town of Dvx aa in Syria. His\nsecondary education was completed in Damascus from where he won a scholarship - In 1951 - to come t:> this country.\nHis early life, working a.rj3 t the\npeople and amongst the in-ell\u00abc tu als had assured him an essen'i ally homan it arian ohara o ter who realised that\nresponsibility for helping these more\nunfortunate rested upon the individual\nhimself.\nAoademioally, he was brilliant,\ncoming top in the final exam.

    "content": "FEU X ORCHESTRAL CONCERT Having hoard the U.C. Orchestra\nin their Foundation Concert at the end\nof last term and our own orchestra in\nthe earlier rehearsals of the Session\nit was with some foreboding that toot\no of respond ant attended the orchestral\no on cert given b the College Orchestra.\nDoubting very au oh whether the standard\nattained by U.C., who had attempted a very ambitious programme, would be rea-ched, i to a me as a very pleasant surprise to find that the I.C. Orchestra\noo ul d hold its own while still playing\nwithin it a technical limitations.\nPerhaps the only way in which i too ul d be faulted was in the. volume of\nsound produced. This was a continual\nmez so forte wh i oh tended to rob the\nmusic of some of its life, although the\ncon duo tor was as much to blame as the\norchestra for this. The effect was\nmost noticeable during the Mozart\nSymphony, and to a lesser extent in\nthe \"Letter Scene\" from Eugene Onegin,\nin wh i oh Miss Daphne Gill was the solo-ist.\nMiss Sill displayed her vocal talents to the full in the scene, yet it was unfortunate that the orchestra tended to drown her voice when singing in\nthe lower registers, where she cannot\ncommand the same power that is available to her at higher pitches. The\n3o ene as a whole was admirably sung\nand played. Having the successes of\nthe symphony and \"Letter Soene\" behind\nit, the orchestra ended the concert\nwith Nioolai's Overture \"The Merry Wives\nof Windsor\", during wh i oh the gaiety of\nthe music affected orchestra and audio\neno e ali.-.e, giving a rousing finale to\na most enjoyable concert. We look\nforward to more like it during the\ncoming Session.\nThe bun-fight, which followed the\nconcert, enabled artists to appear and\nre-appear in their own fields. The\nhighlights of the entertainment were\nGraham silver's appear a noes as a 'Palm\nCourt* violinist wh i oh would have occupied the whole evening had the audience had its way; a sonata for two\nbassoons by a German composer with an\nun pronoun o able name, in which the\ninstrument lived up to its other name\nof buffoon, and two melodious duets\"\nfor trombone wh i oh degenerated into\nduets for one and a half players owing\nto the inability of one of the players\nto keep a straight face while playing\nand collapsing with mirth in a true\nGoon Show style to the greater mirth\nof the w atoning. Space does not\npermit a full resume' of the evening's entertainment, but let it be said in conclusion may the music so oie ty continue to thrive on the talents of the\nCollege (and R.C.M.) and give enjoyment in the many diverse ways possible\nfor years to come.\nP.R. White,\nSELKIRK HALL by an inmate\nThrough the generosity of Mr.\nWilliam Selkirk, in 1945, the college\nwas able to obtain a large house in\nHolland Park, for use as a Hall of\nResidence for Imperial College students.\nThe house called Selkirk Hall provides\nlodgings for 15 undergraduate men,\nselected from all3 constituent colleges.\nThe hostel is completely diff e rent in organisation from all the other\nI.C. hostels, for instance, in an\nevening we all dine together with the\nwarden and his wife. Nowhere else\nin I.C. do the differing spheres of student and staff life so deeply\nintersect. Since there are only 15\nstudents we all get to know each other\nwell. During the year we formed cut\nown football and cricket teams to play\nthe Holland Club (I.C. Technicians),\nand we have organised several parties\nand dances to which the building is eminently suited. Amenities include\nlounges, radio, gram a phone, telephone,\nan excellent catering service, tea mashing equipment and No. 26 (a female\nspeech-therapist hostel just round the\ncomer). We have our own traditions such as Russian bathing and professorial\ndinners, and our own trophies which\nincludes an oar presented by Colonel\nLowry, a brick, a top-hat and a 'reputed\ntc be fierce' bandy-legged dog.\nFor the past 8 years Mr. P..S. H.G. Thompson, a lecturer in the department\nof Mathematics, has been warden of\nSelkirk Hall. Mr. Thompson and his wife have devoted much of their. lives to the welfare of students, in China\nas well as in London.\nMr. Thompson is a friendly academic man who never fails to entertain\nwith his numerous anecdotes. He is a well informed and stimulating con-versa tion a list. His long experience\nwith undergraduates enables him to\nunderstand and help them.\nMrs. Thompson who has a degree in biology is an efficient housekeeper.\nShe is sympathetic to student needs,\nand nothing is too much trouble for their well-being.\nAn era is coming to an end and\nstudents past and present wish Mr.\nand Mrs. Thompson a happy retirement\nfrom the somewhat exacting post of\nWarden.\nNext year Mr. CCS. Seaford,\nthe college Domestic Bursar, will be\nthe new Warden. It will be different\nto have a member of the administration\nrather than the academic staff,a man\nversed in the arts rather than the\nsciences, however we hope that he will have an interesting and enjoyable time\nat Selkirk Hall. P. Clark\nWANTED!\nFelix staff for next term. Vacancies exist for\nEditors and Sub-editors. Writers and Cartoonists also\nwill be we loom e.A vacancy also exists for a Photographic Editor. If TOD are interested, apply to the\npresent Editor - M.R. Honer - via the Onion Raok.\nCOLLEGE RECITAL Considering the type of weather the\ncountry is undergoing at the present\ntime, the recital given by members of\nI.C. Musical Society drew a relatively\nlarge s>k11 will to hear a programme of\nworks by oom posers ranging from Pergolesi to Gordon Jaoob. Although the\noverall standard of perform a oe was high,\nthe composition of the programme was not\ninspiring. There are several competent pianists and cellists in the\noo lle ge whose inclusion in the recital\nwould hare lent a better bala no e to the\nproceedings. As it was we heard three\nviolinists and one singer.\nThe highlight of the recital was\nundoubtedly the perform a oe of the last\nmovement of the Cesar Franck sonata\nplayed by Leslie Goldstone (C*G) accompanied by his sister. This is a difficult work to play at much slower\nspeeds than that taken for performance\nand all credit is due to the players for\nmaintaining a very high degree of almost\nprofessional competence throughout,\nalthough at times one felt that the\no hosen speed was a little too great and\nthis had to be masked by considerable\nover pedalling on the piano.\nPerhaps the most unfortunate\nchoice in the whole programme was the\ntitle of soprano for Alexandra Mills\n(ROM). Her vo ioe range, as shown in\none of four \"Songs of the Hebrides\" is oort a in ly limited and it was felt that\neven mezzo-soprano would be rather ambitious at times. The songs she\no hose, three seventeenth century songs\nby Pergolesi and Scarlatti and the\nHebridean Songs mentioned above, left\none rather cold, and in the higher\nregister gave the soloist no little difficulty at times.\nGraham Silver (RSM) gave one of\nhis usual te oh nio ally dazzling performances with the Praeludiua and Allegro\nby Kreialer and a Spanish Danoe by de\nFalls. Judging from performances later\nin the day, however, his talent seems\nsomewhat misplaced in works of this\nkind. At times during the Kreisler\nwork his bowing tended to be a little indistinct, and another violinist\ndisliked the fingering used, yet on the\nwhole it was a very pleasing performance.\nLast en the programme was the Prelude, Passaoaglia and Fugue by Gordon\nJaoob played by Harold Allan and Stefan Wipf (RCM). The first impression\nof the work was that it was a bagpipe\naccompaniment to a further Hebridean\nsong. Possibly it was the work itself\nor the unusual instrumental combination\nwh i oh added to the affect, but there\nseemed to be no semblance of order, apax\nfrom the construction of the fugue and i recap of the theme of the prelude\ntowards the end. A performance later\nin the day dispelled all doubts. At\nthe seo on d hearing it was unquestionably\nbetter performed and the type of noise\nrequested by the composer more comfortable to the ear giving a rather pleasant\nmodern chamber work. Perhaps more\npractice is the answer?\nP.R. White\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Outer\nPEACE SOCIETY\nDear Sir,\nI was disgusted to hear that the\nSocial Clubs Committee decided at this\nmeeting on Thursday 7th May that there\nwas no need for a Peace Society at I.C. and that other societies already ful filled its intended aims.\nFirstly, if there are suo h societies\nalready, I should like to h oar of them-,\nfor I have not as yet heard of a Sooiety at I. C.w hi oh supports the aims of\nthe campaign for Nuclear Disarmament\nopenly or give aw nt to the Pacifist\ncause. Perhaps these societies mentioned hold their meetings in secret?\nSeoondly, by what authority does\nthe Social Clubs Committee imply that\nwe have no need of a Peace Society\nwhen certain students have made it dear that they are determined that\nit should be formed and are not satisfied that existing Societies completely\nrepresent their feelings? -Surely if students express a need for a Sooiety,\nthen the need ia there, and whether\nthere are 22 or 220 signatures is quite irrelevant.\nIt has been objected that a Peace\nSooiety would automatically aspire to\nthe left. Does this mean to suggest\nthat only people of the left have any\nconcern about peace - I really would\nlike to- know.\nAlfred Linney.\nDear Sir,\nAt the S. C.C. meeting last Thursday a motion, proposed by Dave Finney,\nto form a Peace Committee in I. C.(i.e. abra noh of the C. N.D.) was adopted.\nHowever, when taken to Union Council by\nthe S. C.C. Seoretary the motion was\nrejected. The reason given was that\nthe functions of such a Committee could\nbe adequately carried out by the International Relations Club, which Mr.\nFinney is oo-opted ante It is a well-known fao t that the I.R.C. is simply a social o lub, and does not provide an\nadequate rostrum for a peace campaign.\nIn view of this, it would appear\nthat this is a deliberate attempt by\nthe Union officials cono er ned to sabotage the formation of a pea oe campaign in.this oo lle ge. At present I.C. is probably the only oo lle ge in London\nwhich does not have su oha campaign, a fao t which does not enhance our popularity with the rest of London University.\nI consider it a scandal that nothing has been done about this question\nbefore, and call upon those Union officials tc present their case before the\n\u2022hole student body at the next Union\nmeeting, where I trust that others\nbeside myself will take u o the matter.\nTours sincerely,\nFred Roberta,\nPhysics 2\nIRVING\nDear Sir,\nIn the controversies that ha>d raged over David Irving, suo h phrases\nas \"assessment of v he facts\" and \"un-biased facts\" have often appeared in\nemotional rather than factual contacts.\nPeople tend to be either 100$ anti-Irving or 100J? pro-Irving (not that\nthere are many of the latter now), and\nneither of these extremes is to my mind\nwholly correct.\nIt is easy to forget that Irving\nis one of the most competent Journalists in\"the University, and was on\nthat basis alone a natural oho ioe for\nthe editorship of Carnival. All will agree, I am sure, that he a a de an excellent Job of the major part of the\nmagazine. The balance could have\nbeen better, it is true, but the standard of presentation was high and the\ndemands of a tight production schedule\nwere jure than adequately met (even\nafter the reprinting, Carnival was\npublished on time). *tis ironic\nthat this fine effort was spoiled as\nit was.\nLet us try and be reasonable\nabout all this. Irving has a point\nof view, and it should be heard, but\nnot in a charity magazine. A just\nand sober condemnation of his action\nis one thing; an exaggerated and\nhysterical hate campaign is another.\nWe o an surely agree to qs,ffe r with\nhis political opinions, .sven though\nwe feel on lv contempt f$r the way he\nchose to express them.\nLastly, it seems less than fair to blame a certain member of I.C. Union Council for what happened. I understand that this gentleman did\nwarn the U.L. U.W. U.S. Committee that\nsomething like this was liable to\nhappen, but the safeguards agreed upon\nwere, at the time, considered adequate.\nl ours sincerely,\nAnthony L. Brookes.\n52\n\" Carnival\" Dear Sir, In your last issue you attacked\nwhat you considered to be the deception committed by the ex-editor of\nCarnival Times: you also said that the\nideologies wh i oh promoted \"suo h abuse\"\nshould not go uno on dem ned. Is it as simple as all that? I don't think so. As one reads through\nthe Press, be it the National Dailies,\nthe Weeklies, - even the University\npublicity and propaganda for the Egalitarian ideologies. There ia little, if any, space given to the other point\nof view. A bala no e has ceased to exist\nThere are some who get a little tired of all this, and who hope to see\nsome of these specious arguments answer-ed. I thing that there is some measure\nof deliberate policy adhered to by the\nwhole Press, wh i oh forbids the printing\nof mu oh reasoned right-wing thinking,\nperhaps for fear of offending oe rta in groups of would-be readers. It is forgotten that Egalitarianiam offends the\nintellects of others.\nIn such circumstances, it is perhaps under st nad able that those, whose\nreasoned views are consistently rejected\nby all the ordinary means of pub ll o it y in favour of the very theories wh i oh they so despise, turn and look for a one extraordinary means of attracting pub-li city. Inevitably either violence or\ndeception will play a part.\nThe argument is often used that the\nviews of the majority should reo e ive the\nmost publicity, and that the Right is so\n\u2022 \u2022 all that it should have none. *et is it really sensible to pro pag and is e people with views they already hold? To\ndo so makes them dogmatic, narrow-minded, complacent, prejudiced, and un-sound. In my view it is right to offer\nroughly equal space to all shades of\nopinion, and the most important thing is to maintain a bala no e. If this were\ndone, the Right would have its share of\nthe publicity, and it would not be forced into unorthodox attempts to get heard.\nTours faithfully,\nM.J. G. Moir\nISSUE - LAST, AMD SPECIAL\nCOMMENT\nI would like to make it dear that\nneither Felix nor the editor has any wish\nto prevent David Irving explaining his\n[point of view or his modus Vivendi. In\ndeed, I would be o dy too glad if he\nwould do so. Three times he has been\noffered the opportunity to do so in the\ncolumns of this paper. That he has\nnever taken the op port ud ty is his own\nfault and he cannot Justifiably oom pl ain that his views are being suppressed.\nEDITION - \"KUM-s NT If J OTE\" "

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No 134 FRIDAY MAY 22 nd 1959 4d UNDER FIRE STATEMENT BY EDITOR\nAt least one point of interest has\narisen from the brouhaha surrounding\nthe affairs of the late David Irvingquite a few people are suddenly aware\nthat there are other student newspapers\naround - other than the venerable *\n\"Sennet\".\nI refer, of course, to those copies\nof PI - the newspaper of University1\nCollege - which were on sale .in the Hall of\nthe Union immediately,proceeding (the\nIrving fracas.\nThese people have looked at EI and\nthan looked at \"Felix\" - which appeared\nshortly afterwards - and to their eye a, the newspaper of their Union came off\na very seo on d best. . .In fact, it seemed to them that they were not being\nserved by their Union as they had the\nright to expect.\nQUESTIONS\nWith this in mind they hare been\nasking some questions. Some very pertinent and pointed questions! Within\none day I was asked the following:\nWhy cannot'our newspaper be'\nprinted, as opposed to the peculiar\nmethod that is used now?\"\n\"Why cannot Felix be giv on at\nleast the general appearance of a newspaper, in, of course, the layout and headings*'\"'\n\"Why not make Felix weekly?\"and\nfinally, a very popular question -\"Why not include advertisements in\nFelix?\" '\nPour good questions, and four that\ncannot be ignored. It is at least some\noom fort that the questioners have thought\nabout their own newspaper and would then\nLike to have a say in its appearance,\nas they have every right to do - Felix\nbeing the Official organ - if you will excuse the Word - of the I.C. Union.\nFAULTS\nWe must however be realistic as to\nthe faults of Felix. Compared/to the\nglossy \"art\" paper that is used in the\nprinting of PI and the Cub, the surface\nof Felix looks rather cheap and crude.\nOompared to the set type of the same\nt wwa paps rs, the typewritten photocopies\nnt the Felix pages look amateurish.\nThe main headings. - the banners and subheadings are at the often all too tender mercies of the man with the stencil.\nAt the last general Union meeting,\nlittle laugh was raised by the fact\nthat the total profit from Felix - donated to the Union funds - was the\nprincely sum of \u00a32. A small amount\nand an insignificant one compared to\nthe vast turn-over of some other organ-is at ions. But it was a profit of \u00a32. The\nglossy PI - the cause of this discontent costs it3 Union between \u00a3200 and\n\u00a3L00 per year, according to the difference between its printing bills and\nthe amount taken from sales. Some of\nthe ether newspapers in London oost\ntheir Unions more in subsidies aix l all this on a much lower readership!\nFelix states proudly that it has\na circulation of 1,500 - wh i oh ia Justified. True this circulation has a tendency to fluctuate being dependent on\nthe vagaries of exams, the weather and\nwhether your grant is pa'd on a Friday.\nBut 1,500 is Justified.\nWith all respect to the Cub and\nto FX and many others of their contemporaries , do you think that they are\ngiving their respective Unions several\nhundred pounds worth of service. I certainly do not think so. I do not\nbelieve that The Imperial Collage\nunion would be justified in appropriating some \u00a3200 of its funds in order\nthat Felix should have type set up for\neach issue.\nADVERTISE*;\nAs to advertising - Felix sell a well enough now (for the purposes of\nthis argument) without filling a pan c with advert*, that can be seen everywhere you turn - from the glossy magazines to the television and along\nevery highway in Britain. Student\nadvertisements are always welcome and\nhave been a regular feature of Felix\nfor a long time - but no \"beer ia best\"\nplease.\nCould Felix appear weekly. It\ncould do, without a doubt, but it will\nnot do so under my editorship, nor, X think, under the editorship of anyone\nwho has anything else to do at this\nCollege. He will soon find that the\ncustomary fortnightly make-up takes\nenough time as it is. I doubt also\nwhether there is enough \"hot\" news\nat this College to fill more than 2\npages each week. If the Union oo ul d be persuaded to pay out some more money\nand employ at least two permanent staff\nfor their newspaper, then perhaps the\nweekly Felix will become a possibility!\nARCHIE MACD0NALD AT HOTSPUR PARK\n3EE BACK PARS\nTHE FUTURE\nIs there any way of changing the\nfao e of Felix without losing its unique ohara c ter as a student newspaper?\nThe following remarks are of a personal\nna*->\u2014e and have no of fi oi al weight\nfor I speak only aa an editor ( and\nnearly a past editor) of this news-paper.\nI believe that the Linotype pro-o ess may offer a means of producing a Felix whose appearance more closely\napproximates to a printed newspaper -and at very little increased oost - if it is acceptable that Felix should\n\"break-even\" rather than try to make\na bigger profit. The present Felix\nprinter ia working on this idea and\nmaybe your first Felix of next year will\nconform to this requirement.\nMy feeling is that Felix has grown\nup - and it is time that he looked like\nan adult.\nWhatever the final solution chosen,\nI feel sure that Felix will emerge tria mohan t, and with his usual grin.\nWe regret to announce the death\nof Mr. Richard Font, M.P. for Clithence,\nLancashire, who has been one of our\nGovernors since 1957, and also chairman\nof the Parliamentary and Scientific\nOoanittee.\nMr. Fort was killed when hi a oar was in a head-on so ll is lon with a coach on the Oxford-Henley road last\nSaturday, May 16th. He leaves a widow and five children.\n\n"

U. the band played magnificently to\ngain a well-deserved ,pla oe in the final at Bedford. But here, where hopes were\nat first understandably high, tragedy\nstruck. The bare! was hit by an unexpected attack of nerves, which was\nattributed to the rather inefficient organisation , poor playing conditions,\nar\u00bbi lack of suitable liquid refreshment.\nThe final result is, however, very commendable and all monetary congratulations\nshould be sent to the President via the\nUnion rack.\nThe personnel were:\nJeff Kay\nMike Newson\nGordon Bartlett Chris Adams\nDick Slingsby\nJohn Farosworth\n- trumpet\n- clarinet\n- trombone\n- piano\n- guitar\n- bass\nand Gordon Frlchard at the drums.\nSpeoial mention should be made of\nJohn Parnsworth whose e*o ellen t bass\nplaying was oom mended by the judges.\nAs with most previously experienced\njazz competitions the organisation was\nrather poor. Next year it is hoped\nthat I.C. Jazz Club will run a competition themselves and win it. DEATH SENTENCE\nAt the B.G. M. of the R.3. M.U. on\nThursday 1V th May the death sentence on\nClem was announced. Just before Easter\nthe Insurance Brokers examining engineer\ninspected her in general and the boiler in particular. When the report was\nsent it wa3 accompanied by a request for the return of the boiler insurance cert-if i cate, the boiler \"being very old, and\npast it's useful life\". This was duly\nreturned, and of course without this\nClem could not be taken on the road again.\nThe cost of replacing the boiler would be far greater than buying a new\nengine, the boiler constituting the major part of the structure, and su oha replacement having to be custom-built.\nAt, t ne union Meeting a deo is ion on\na new mascot was deferred until the next\nmeeting, to allow the Minesmen to think\nover the problems involved. The main\nquestion is whether to have another\nsteam-propelled vehicle or one powered\nby an internal combustion engine.\nBoth have their pros and cons, and the\ndecision of the next meeting is looked\nforward to with interest.\nI.M.

C.A.C. have\nbeen narrowly defeated, so that.this\nyear a special effort was made.\nThe 5th and 7t>\" comprised the heats\nof most events and several finals. The\nfinal of the 220 yards low hurdles\ngained the club 2nd and 5th places.\nW. Melbourne was 2nd with T. Hyslop\n5th. The 3OOO metres steeplechase saw\na fine run by J. Cleator, who was\nnarrowly defeated by Bryan of St. Mary's Hospital. Both men were credited with\nthe same time of 9 \u00bb 27.6 wh i oh constitutes a new championship best per- .\nform ance. The two mile walk saw two\nYorkshiresen fight it out for 5th and\n6th places. (No comment)\nThe only events in which I. C.A.C. had no representatives in the finals,\nheld on the 9th, were the Hammer and\nTriple Jump.\nProbably the best individual\nperformances were set up by\nC.C. Connolly, A. McDonald and J. Cleator, all l st year students. Connolly placed 2nd in both the Shot and\nJavelin (174' 5\") and 3rd in the discus.\nHis shot and javelin performances form\nnew college records.\nArchie McDonald provided our only\nvictory of the champs when he walked\nhome (not really) in the 220 yards, in a very good time of 22.4 sees; He mas\nalso placed second in the 100 yards.\nA fine effort,Archie.\nJ. Cleator, as already mentioned\ngained 2nd place in the steeplechase.\nIn the mile Pete Sperrin of St. Mary's Hospital proved too strong for John,\nwho recorded a very fast 4 rain. 21.1\nsees., when taking 2nd plane.\nC.C. CONNOLLY IN ACTION\nIt is impossible to mention all I. C.A.C'3 individual performances but\nI feel I must congratulate Pete\nRayment, our captain., far a very good\nhalf a dle. His time of 1 m.58.9 sees,\nonly gained him sixth place, but at las*\nhe has broken the 2 minute barrier.\nDave Briggs ran a good 3 miles when\ntaking 2nd place to Tory Napier.\nThe final result was#I. C.A.C.94 pts., St. M ry's Hospital 77 pts.\nand the remainder of the Colleges\nsomewhere below 4'. pts. This victory\nwas the result of an all round team\neffort: each competitor deserves\nspecial congratulations.\nCRICKET CLUB'S PROMISING START\nThe cricket o lub, despite the loss\nof several \"veterans\" has made a most\npromising start to the season. Though the\nls tH has never quite been at full str-eng th, It has never looked like losing a match.\nThe first match at Wye was raised\nby the weather though there was ample\ncompensation! Batting first against\nL. S.E.(a side who have often taken advantage of our early season for*) we\nslumped from 66 for 3 to 74 for 6 but\na fine unbroken partnership between L. Williams (42) and T. King (40) enabled\nus to declare at 158 for 6. L.3.B.'s attempt to get the runs was foiled\nby a fine spell of bowling by Logan who\ntook 8 for 18 and they scraped a draw,\nbeing 40 for 9 at the o lose. Against Baatoote, thanks to a tidy\n58 by White, 43 by Bartholomew and 37\nno by Burden we declared at 15? for 7-Eastoote started briskly and there were\nvisions of a great finish but our leg-spinner Galbally ( 4 for 22) induced them\nto hit out recklessly and once more we\nhad to bo content with a draw with I.C. very much on top, Eastoota being 88 for\n5 st one stage before they gave up the\n*hae o. The match against St. Mark and St.\nJohn gave the lat II their fi-st win (by\n58 runs). Some attractive strokes\nfrom L. Williams (32) for at was fol lowed by another fine spell of bowling\nby Logan who finished the match with s hat-trick ( all bowled!) and figures of\n8 for 23.\nLogan was to prove his worth with\nthe bat in the next a a to hv. Old Sinjuns\nwhen he so or oda brisk 31 wh i oh consolidated a steady start, opening bat-j man White scoring 43. Setting them\n188 to win st s rata of 85 runs per hour\nthe Old Sinjun* collapsed and were 59\nfar 6 before they decided to play out\ntime and on a good Harlington w ioke t, few things are easier!\nSt. Bernards Hospital were trounced\nby 7 wickets. Batting first they were\nbowled out for 54 (Logan taking 6 for 25)\nand we hit off the runs before tea for\nthe loss of 3 w ioke ta. Middlesex Hospital took 2| hours to\nscore 127, Martin Baking 5 for 22 for\nI.S. but our bid to score the runs in100 minutes did not come off, primarily\nbecause of \u2022 poor start and the match was\ndrawn.\nThe 2nd XI are also unbeaten so\nfar. Most notable was their win against\nKings last week. The Third H have played occasionally and won 2, lost 1 and\nof course the Sunday XI has been up to\nits usual antics (Captained by Oggi!!)\nThere are several encouraging\nfeatures of the teams' play. The\nbatting ia solid right down the order,\nthe bowling is tight and varied and bowlers are trying to bowl to their field,\nonly the fielding needs tightening up\nand this will undoubtedly come with more\npractice. Seven new players have al ready made the l st XI and all have performed well. Significant is the fact\nthat both Eastoote and Old Sinjuns beat\nus last year while this year they were\nfighting to avoid defeat all the time.\nThere is much material end (soccer teams\nplease mote) we have a bearded fields-man who persists in kicking the ball\n(usually over the boundary) with remarkable accuracy.\nLooking ahead to the Devon tour,\nwe should be able to take a strong touring side even with several members from\nthe 2nd or 3rd XI's whose keenness and\nability ia beyond doubt.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD fruited by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO., 307a Telephone Place, W.14 XeL FUL7969 "

TJ.\nChampions) in an exciting away match on\nSaturday last. Each event was closely\ncontested and many excellent performances\nwere seen on a rather uneven grass track.\nNet -ble among these was a1 min.\n59.0 sec. by our captain, 21 year old( Mr?) Peter Rayment, in the 880 yards.\nBernard Curtis recorded a double victory when clocking 10.1 and 23.2 in the 100\nand 220 yards respectively.\nThe final3 core in the match was a81 pts to 75 win for Bristol. The day\nwas sounded off in typical fashion by\nmost of the team missing the last train back to London. (Where are they now?)\nKODAK'10'\nLast Saturday John Collins took part\nin the Kodak 10 mile road race, against\ndistinguished athletes such as Pi rie and Merriman. Over 100 competitors\nstarted the race which was won by Towl\nin50 min. 17 sees, with Merriman 2nd and\nPiri e3rd. John ran a very good race\nto finish13 thin a time of 53 minutes.\nLAWN TENNIS In the last two weeks the club has\nhad considerable success and won all its matches. The first team have done\nvery well, having good wins over Kings,\nU.C. and Wye, the latter being the most\nenjoyable match of the season, so far. The team i3 beginning to settle down and\nfind its true form; far tun at ely, too\nall the pairs are very even and we have\na steady, reliable team - the first time\nfor many years. The Club was given a walk-over against ^.M.C. in the U.L. Cup who were unlucky in not being able\nto raise a team over the Whitsun week-end.\nThe 3e cond team have recently\nbeaten Northern Polytechnic by a winning\nmargin of 5 matches to 2, the match being\nunfinished due to bad light.

M.96 Sports day this year was blessed\nwith a brilliantly sunny day and a fair sized crowd to spur the performers on to\ntwo college records and eight best\nsports performances. Outstanding performances were recorded by A. MacDonald\nin winning both the 100 and 220, and\nC. Connolly who won the Javelin, Discus\nand shot all in new meeting records.\nW.

The old record of 21' 9\" had stood since 1923.\nThe mile once again provided the\nsp eot a cle of the day with J. Cleator and\nD.

Benham cc n pet i r.g for the first time showed definite promise but finished fatigued after a slow\nstart, K. Weale too, could mature but\nmust learn to concentrate en the race in hand.\nIn the 4*4-0 yd s R.C.S. scored a double with K. Ludlair. coming th rai gh very\nfast to win from A. Meade who had made\nthe pace throughout. During the interval entertainment was provided by a netball match between I. C.'.V. A. and the\nBasketball Club, in a game in which the\nresult never seemed important.\nThe 880 was won by P. Rayment the\nI.C. captain followed by D. Briggs, both\nshowing good form and judgement Ln an\nexcellent race. An innovation to the\nmeeting was the introduction of a1500m steeplechase won by J. lle at or with\nA. Larkum runner up. Despite the comparative rarity of this race all the\nrunners gave a fine display in the technique of this difficult sport. The\nmare sadistic spectators were well sat-is fie d when one competitor plunged into the water jump.\nThe ladies invitation relay was won\nby Reading. I.C. were doubly represented by both I. C.W.

F.C.S. then\nwon the 220.220.443 relay with a brilliant last leg by A. Meade, but Guilds\nsquared the issue by winning the 4*110\nwith a new sports record of 45.0 sees.\nThe ou toome then rested on the tug between R.C.S. and Mines, and we were tre a ted to the sight of the Guildsmen cheering\nthe Mines team home to their only vic to ry. Guilds were then the victors of\nthe sports day for the fourth successive\nyear.\n\n"
