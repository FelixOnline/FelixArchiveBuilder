    "content": "CFEATURE:\nPROFILE the Rector\nAs the Rector completes his final months of office at Imperial College, FELIX takes a look back at his career, and looks to his future as Vice-Chancellor.\nA large man with a clumsy gait, he manages\nto look uncomfortable in any chair. He has a peculiar ability not to seem 'at home' in any\nsurroundings. In his Queens Gate residence\nhe has the air of a tired but proud museum\ncurator; in his fifth-floor Sherfield office he\ngives the impression of having arrived only a week ago, and not having properly settled in.\nBut the Rector has been here for rather\nmore than a week. After twelve years at\nImperial College this 60 year old son of a Welsh pastor is to become Vice-Chancellor\nof the largest University in the country.\nEarly career\nFlowers read Physics at Cambridge. After\nhis DSc at Birmingham he went to the\nAtomic Energy Research Establishment at\nHarwell. The head of the theoretical physics\ndivision at that time was Klaus Fuchs, who\nlater turned out to be a spy for the Russians.\nOn his being apprehended by the police\nother people who were senior to Flowers\nwere either not offered the job or did not\naccept it. At the age of 28, therefore, Flowers\nbecame head of the division, to the sup rise of\nmany people, not the least himself.\nHe built up the division, which was\nnaturally in bad morale, to a very flourishing\naffair. But the lure of a cade me was too\nstrong.\n'I soon realised that the longer I stayed at\nHarwell, the more administrative my role\nwould become. When I was offered the chair\nof Theoretical Physics at Manchester, I quickly accepted it.'\nWithin a year, the Head of Physics at\nManchester had left on a sabbatical leaving\nFlowers in charge. In the event he never\ncame back, and Flowers found himself head\nof one of the biggest Physics Departments in\nthe country.\n'This led to me taking an interest in an\nenormous range of things; other people's work, things which were second-hand. Woe\nbefall any administrator who doesn't take\nthat second-hand experience seriously. You\nbecome a ponti fic at or over everything,\nknowing nothing.'\nPast peak\nAt about the age of 40, Flowers was\nbecoming recognized nationally in the policy-forming world; he joined the predecessor of\nthe Science Research Council (now the\nSERC) - and the Advisory Council for\nScientific Policy (now the ABRC). But there\nwere other reasons for his finally leaving\nactive academic work.\n'I was becoming aware that I had achieve c all I was going to achieve in research. I have\nseen people, only too often, past their\npeak, becoming gradually more t etc hy and\nmiserable, thinking it's other people's fault.\n'I knew that I either had to give up my\npolicy-forming activities and get the external\nstimuli that was needed or I had to give up the\nidea of an intensive, front-line, research\ncareer.'\nHe decided on the latter course, and so for\nhis six years as Chairman of the Science\nResearch Council, he was gradually running\ndown his research work.\nThis post took Flowers to the topmost\nlevels of science policy formation, dealing\nwith cabinet ministers and senior civil\nservants. His ministers were Crossland,\nShort, Margaret Thatcher and Shirley\nWilliams.\n'In quite different ways the two ladies\nshone most: I was on very good terms with\nboth of them on a personal basis, although I agree much more with Shirley than I do with\nMaggie.'\nImperial\nFrom 1965 onwards, offers of vice-chancellorship s started to flood in. Flowers\ndoesn't like to say how many offers, but he\nmanages to convey the idea that there were\nquite a few.\n'I remember very well having lunch with\nShirley Williams one day. We were\ndiscussing each other's futures. She said that\n10 Friday 1 Fet\nFEATURED\nI should accept a vice-chancellorship. I said\nthat this was nonsense\u2014terrible sort of job.'\nAn yet within two months Lord Sherfield\nhad offered, and Flowers had accepted, the\njob of Rector at Imperial College.\n'I suddenly realised that Imperial College\nwas exactly right for me. And gosh was I right, because I 've had the most marvellous\ntime here.'\nFlowers had perceived that Imperial\nCollege was 'supposed to be good, but was\nnot quite as good as it should have been'. He\nfelt that he had an ability to put such\ninstitutions right.\n'I did it at Harwell, I did it at Manchester, I did it at the SRC and I think I 've done it here.\nThe main thing wrong with IC was that it was\nso convinced that it was tops, that it wasn't. It\ndidn't question itself enough.' And so\nFlowers had to adopt the unpopular r6 le of\nforcing IC to face up to itself.\n'I knew that until it had done that, the\nCollege did not have any hope of improving\nitself.'\nWhen the Rector came to IC, Heads of\nDepartment were appointed for life.\nResearchers of ability were being held back\nby these 'complacent old men'. He therefore\nmade head ships five year appointments. He\nraised the standard of staff appointments,\nand of student admissions.\n'We had all sorts of funny overseas\nstudents who had no motivation to be here at\nall.'\nPeople point to the inception of the\ninterdisciplinary centres (environmental\ntechnology, biotechnology, robotics, etc) as\nbeing Flowers' most important innovation\nwhilst at IC.\n'Problems of structure have always\ninterested me. Here at IC we had the\nseparate departments, divided up the way\nthey are for good reasons, and yet these\ndivisions create borderline problems.\n'Having established any vertical structure\nyou prom t ly have to set up some\norganisation, however flimsy, at 90 degrees.'\nIt was the lack of such a mechanism that\nFlowers sought to put right.\n'I had just done the Royal Commission on\nEnvironmental Pollution and felt that there\nwas a great need, not for wish y was hy environmental sciences^at undergrad level,\nbut for people of real professional\ncompetence in different subjects to come\ntogether and work on the environmental\nproblems.\n'What people in industry often don't realise is that a university can't respond to\nthe latest fad by setting up a whole\ndepartment. Just because of Sinclair\nsomeone will doubtless suggest the setting\nup of a Department of Electric Tricycles. But\nthis is wrong. A department is there to teach\nwhat is known\u2014a sound body of doctrine.\nBut at the same time a university such as this\nmust be in the swim, in the modern world. So\norganised within the integrity of disciplines\nwe are trying to tackle problems which\nrespect no boundaries. The centres, then,\nare the doing places and the departments are\nteaching places'.\n1985\nLondon University\u2014the future\nIn 1980 the Flowers Report was\npublished\u2014a much criticized report which\nsuggested major changes in medical\neducation. It was said at the time that the\nunpopularity of the report was responsible\nfor Flowers not being offered the vice-chancellorship three years ago. But he still\nstands by the findings of the report.\n'Not only do I stand by them but they've\nbeen accepted, almost aH of them. Not in\nevery detail, but the essence of it has been\naccepted, and the logic of it is entirely being\nput into effect now.\n'The problems that the University faces\nare again structural ones\u2014the meaning of a Federal University needs sorting out. At the\nmoment it's rather an ill-assorted collection\nbut with the Swinnerton-Dyer Report we are\nseeing the formation of fewer, larger and\nmore comparable institutions.'\nThe Rector was made a peer in 1979. He is\nan active member of the House of Lords\n'when time allows', and is a passionate\nsupporter of its existence.\n'One of the most fascinating experiences\nof my life was to watch Ken Livingstone in the\npublic gallery at the House, listening to\nspeeches of support of the GLC from\nmembers of arf institution that his party is\ncommitted to abolish.'\nFlowers has enjoyed his time at IC\u2014he\nhas been able to indulge himself in his\npassions for art and music at the same time\nas heading a great institution. He says\n'I have contrived to enjoy my life enormously\nso far'. One gets the impression that he will\ncontinue to do so at Senate House, just as\nmuch as he did at Imperial.\n11\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022TITERS\nSilwood Park\nDear Sir,\nI feel your report in last week's FELIX (No\n693), headed, 'Hendy in Silwood resignation\nshocker', requires some further comment.\nIt has been Union policy for a number of\nyears to hold one Council meeting at the\nCollege field station at Silwood Park.\nSilwood is not only a place of full-time study\nfor many postgraduates and academic staff,\nbut is also frequently used for a variety of\nundergraduate courses ranging from\nZoology field studies to Civil Engineering\nsurveying courses and Physics practicals\nusing the nuclear reactor. It also plays host to\na number of social functions, the RCS\nSummer Ball, Orchestra rehearsal weekends\nand joint PG parties to name a few.\nOver recent years Silwood has become very\nmuch detached from the main campus at\nSouth Kensington and I, in conjunction with\nthe previous and present Silwood Park\nChairman, have done my best, I believe with\nmuch success, to bring some cohesion and\nunderstanding between the two.\nThese points along with the fact that\nSilwood receives a sizeable grant from IC\nUnion should make it apparent that Silwood\nand its residents are as much as part of ICU as\nthe buildings and students in South\nKensington. It did not seem unreasonable\ntherefore to expect the members of Council\nto make a small effort to attend a meeting at\nSilwood. After all, the Silwood Chairman\nattends numerous meetings at South\nKensington.\nSilwood is likely to undergo major changes\nin the coming few years, not all of benefit to\nthe students. Without the backing of Union\nas a whole, their views are unlikely to be\nheard. To fail to go to Silwood for this\nmeeting would be a personal slight to all the\nresidents there. Who could blame them if\nthey look suspiciously on students attending\nshort courses?\nI should also like to point out to Council\nmembers and those that voted them to office,\nthat if they are unable to spare the time they\ncan always delegate their vote to somebody\nelse, better surely than being unrepresented.\nI hope this letter explains my position and\nthat the majority of Council members take\ntheir positions with a suffice ntl y responsible\nattitude to make my resignation unnecessary.\nYours sincerely,\nChris Hendy\nIC Council Chairman\nPG AAO 1984/85\n2\nDear Sir,\nI would like to offer my full support to\nChris Hendy over his threatened resignation\nfrom his post as Council Chairman. Whilst\nthis may sound like petty hack wrangling s to\nmany FELIX readers, Chris is one of the\nmost responsible members of Council, and\nthe principles involved are very important to\nthe future running of the Union.\nWill all students reading this please go\nalong to the next UGM (yes I know they seem\nboring, but \u00a3250,000 is a lot of money). And\nif you have anything to complain about then\nget off your backsides and tell your Dep Rep,\nor your CCU President, or a sabbatical, but\ndon't just sit there and do nothing.\nChris Hendy is just trying to do his job, his\nvoluntary Union job, and up to now he has\nbeen doing it well. If he should be forced to\nquit then it will be a great loss, and I 've got\nthe feeling that he will not be the last.\nThank you for reading this.\nGraham Thorpe\nIC Academic Affairs\nLounge, RIP off\nDear Sir,\nI would like to bring to the attention of IC\nstudents the mercenary activities of the\ncowboy rip-off merchants purporting to be\nImperial College's Entertainments\nCommittee. The most recent of their\nunderhand dealings occurred after Friday\nnights's Dinner and Dance, an event\nattended by 300 people and costing an arm\nand a leg. Ent's saw fit to cash in on the high\nspirits of the occasion and the desire to go on\nuntil the early hours.\nThe services they provided were\nridiculously overpriced. Their incompetence\nmanifested itself in their need to employ ten\ngroupies for the night.\nWe all appreciate that the Lounge is on its\nlast legs but we felt that some effort could\nhave been made to rid it of it's derelict\nappearance. No efforts had been made to\ndecorate the room and there were an\ninadequate number of chairs available and all\nof two tables laid out.\nAll in all it was a real anti-climax to one ot\nthe best nights of the year and many people\nleft early extremely angry at being ripped-off\nby fellow students and di satisfied with the\nEnts services.\nThose who did remain to the bitter end,\nalthough few in number, were deprived of an\nhour's 'fun' when the disco was shut down at\n5 am (having been booked until 6) the Ents\nCommitttee charged \u00a31 30 to cover the cost\nof the unsociable hours but we estimate that\nthey made vast profits out of the exorbitant\nprices. Who do Ents answer to for their\nactions and who is checking where this\nmoney goes to?\nThe Lounge is dead,\nEnts RIP\nYours\nMaribel Anderson\nFriday 1 February 1985\nFELIX\nA time\nfor change\nMichael Arthur's departure from the Student\nServices Office is an ideal opportunity for a fundamental re-organization of the way in\nwhich that office runs.\nThere are irreconcilable conflicts of\ninterest between the efficient admins t ration of student halls of residence and the proper\nprovision of a welfare service. And yet the\nstudent services office attempts to fulfill both\nof these roles, often with an interchange of\nstaff between residence and welfare.\nIt is not difficult to imagine circumstances\nunder which a landlord would give a different\nopinion or advice to a tenant than the\nopinion or advice that a disinterested\ncounsellor would proffer.\nUnder those same circumstances, a counsellor who works in the same office as\nthe landlord and looks to the landlord as the\nsuperior, could hardly be expected to give\nsound advice. But this is the situation that\nprevails in the student services office today.\nAnd while it prevails neither the Student\nServices Officer nor the Welfare Adviser can\nbe expected to perform to the full potential of\ntheir jobs.\nThe solution is to remove welfare\nresponsibilities from the student service\noffice and to leave it responsible for\nadministering College Halls and Houses. It\nmight well be called the Student Residence\nOffice.\nAn independent Welfare Office could then\nbe established, under Union control, and\npreferably in the Union building.\nIn other words the solution is to refer to the\nsituation that prevailed at College in the late\n70s. Under those circumstances a Fremantle\nresident could go to the Residence Office to\ncomplain that his roof had fallen in. He could\nthen go to the Welfare Office to obtain\nsd und, unbiased and independent advice on\nwhat to do about it.\nAcknowledgements: Particular thanks to\nHugh, who did the distribution last week,\nGrenville, Ajay, Nigel, Pete, Dave Jones,\nRichard, Absorbance, Finian, Luke, Jon,\nJohn, Pete C,J, Tinker, Martin all the\ncolla tors and Rosemary and Tony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

Difficult to answer that without\ngiving you an enormous dossier on the personal\nbackground of eighteen or twenty persons from the\ncomplete spectrum of society; old and young, Catholic\nand Protestant, students and teachers, porters and\npriests, from Edingburgh to Earl's Court. Just to give you\nthe flavour of this app et ising recipe though, here are a few of the people whom you might meet.\nFr Peter Bowes is a priest who has spent a year recently\nin India, looking into their spirituality. However he also\nhas his feet firmly on the ground through his work\namongst young people in England.\nAliens\ncontact Imperial\nDo you think Christians are all incredibly boring\nreligious fanatics who have no idea what it's like in\nthe 'real world'? If so, you've never met the\nChaplaincies. They are full of real people who are as\nfar removed from your average religious fanatic as\nAttila the Hun is from Mother Theresa. During\n'Contact Week' the Chaplaincies invite a team of\npeople from all walks of life to come into the college.\nThey will talk about their beliefs and experiences in\na series of events based around discussions\ngroups/workshops on a variety of topics of current\nrelevance to students. No one in the chaplaincies\nclaims to have all the answers about the meaning of\nlife (unlike some other brands) but if you ever\nwondered why we're here or whether you should\ngive a damn about anyone else, why not come along\nto one of the groups and air your views - you'll be\nparticularly welcome this week, whatever you\nbelieve.\nBill Kirkpatrick has been described as an 'urban\nhermit'. From his flat in Earl's Court he acts as a counsellor and friend to anyone who needs him. His work\namong people 'rejected' by our society has given him\nunique insights into applying the Christian faith.\nSally Theakston was the president of East Anglia\nUniversity SU before taking up her present job with the\nstudent Christian movement, so she will have a lot to say\nabout what students can do in following the the Gospel.\nAlthough they come from various backgrounds, all of\nthe team have one thing in common \u2014 they are relating\ntheir faith to the real-life situations in which they find\nthemselves. It is this experience of the world outside\nstudent life and how they have come to terms with it\nwhich should make the discussions and workshops an\nunmissable event for any IC student looking beyond their\nfirst pay cheque.\n1\n2 Friday 1 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "LSPORT\nWATER POLO\nIC Water Polo team travelled to!\nWarwick last weekend for the\nplay off for the last place in the;\nUAU finals. Due to a lack ofI\ninformation regarding the i arrangements, we arrived at\nHam to find that the tournament j started at 1pm. We also\ndiscovered that our first match\nwasn't until 2pm, although it\nenabled us to evaluate the\nstrength of the opposition before\nwe played.\nSince only one team would go\nthrough to the finals, it was\nhardly surprising that there was a lot of tension, and the first match\nwas marred by a large number of\nsilly fouls. However, Loughborough's tactics of fighting all\nthe way paid off when they\nfinished 4-2 winner over Cardiff.\nThe second match was IC vs\nLeeds. Leeds made a strong start\nand scored the first goal, but\nafter surviving two corners, IC\nscored three times to go into a31 lead at half time. The second\nhalf went Leeds' way and they\nscored twice to our once, but\nthanks to a saved penalty by\nDave Wall, IC won 4-3.\nThe obviously impartial\narrangements continued with IC\nhaving five minutes rest before\nplaying Loughborough (who\nwere twice in the position of\nplaying a team that had just\ncompleted a game). Imperial\nagain went a goal down from the\nstart but fought back to be at two\nall at half time with both sides\nfighting hard to gain an\nadvantage. The start of the\nsecond half showed an IC revival\nand after a heavy series of raids\non the Loughborough goal we\nwere 5-3 up, with goals by Rob\nEastman and Stuart Chorlton.\nThis wasn't to last, and while IC\nbecame complacent (and tired),\nLoughborough became more\ndetermined and scored four\ngoals to our one, thus winning 7-6.\nThe next match was\nmemorable for one thing. The\nCardiff goalkeeper was sent out\nand while he was watching from\nthe side his defence were able to\nrepel the Leeds attack.\nFor the second \u2022 time in the\ntour n amant Loughborough were\nable to play a team that had just\n18\ncompleted a match, and it is\nhardly surprising that they were\n5-0 winners against Leeds in an\nundistinguished game.\nThe final match was IC vs\nCardiff. Neither side had a chance of winning the\nto urna mnet, so it was played in a more friendly spirit than the\nother games. In the end we drew\n4-4, with IC coming second in the\ntour n amant. Our man of the\ntournament award goes to the\ncaptain for being joint top scorer\nwhile being sent out five times in\nthree matches.\nFOOTBALL\nBernard Sunley 2, Holbein 2\nIn the game billed as the game of\nthe season, two closely matched\nteams battled in the snow on an\nicy pitch. It was a highly\ncompetitive and physical game,\nand the final score is probably a fair reflection on the balance of\nplay.\nFor the first twenty-five\nminutes both teams struggled to\nfind their feet and create an\nopening. However, the flair and\nspeed of Andrew Lett ensured\nthat Bernard Sunley maintained\nthe upper hand.\nThis period of the game was\nnot without incident. A30 yard\nshot by the Holbein captain Paul\nBravery cannoned off the post,\ncentre-forward Andy Keelin\nskied the ball over the bar from\ninside the six yard box, and\nBernard Sunley right wing\nFrancis Katelture failed to make\nuse of an over hit cross in front of\nan open goal. The breakthrough\ncame when a careless back pass by Holbein's centre back Phil\nClapp was intercepted by\nRichard Dobedoe, who in an\nuncharacteristic display of cool\nfinishing took the ball around the\nkeeper and slotted it ruthlessly\ninto the net.\nBernard Sunley now took the\nupper hand and another goal by\nDobedoe, beautifully set up by\nKervick Sayers left Bernard\nSunley 2-0 up at the interval.\nHolbein came back with a vengeance in the second half,\nand Bernard Sunley did well to\nhold off the intense pressure until\ntwenty minutes from the end. In\na goal mouth scramble Neil\nBroekhuisen managed to put the\nball past the Bernard Sunley\nkeeper.\nSAILING\nScore: Pete H.1 sinking; Pete R.2 capsizes.\nLast Saturday two teams from IC\ntravelled to Datchet in order to\nsail against Brunei University's team and the University of\nLondon second team.\nThe Imperial teams, being\namongst the greatest tact it ions of the sailing world, pulled off the\nincredible man oe vre of staying in\nthe warm clubhouse while\nBrunei and UL2 battled it out in\nthe cold early in the morning.\nHowever, the time came that\nImperial had to go out and do\nbattle. Preparations started by\nthe two Imperial teams racing\neach other.\nWhen the start gun went it was\nTony for the Pinkies who took\nthe lead with his team mate Pete\nclose behind. However, the wind\nby this time had picked up\nconsiderably and as the fleet\nturned down wind boats started\nwiping Out sending their\noccupants into the extremely\ncold water. While most people\nmanaged to get their boats\nupright without too much\ndifficult ly Pete and Kate where in\nthe unfortunate position of\nfinding their boat sink ng after a capsize. In a dramatic rescue\nthey were plucked from the icy\nwaters. The boat was rescued\nlater in the day, by then nearly\ncompletely submerged.\nTABLE TENNIS\nThe first team are hoping for a better second half to the.season\nin division two of the Central\nLeague. Currently bottom of the\ndivision they received a minor set\nback last week by losing to the\nonly team they beat in the first\nhalf. However the team should\nbe back up to full strength soon\nwhen David Rhodes recovers\nfrom Christmas and hopefully\nturns all those 5-4 losses into 5-4\nwins this time around.\nTeam two of division four\nsuffered two unwelcome defeats\nat the end of last term and the\nfirst match this term and so have\ndropped to fourth in the division.\nNot to be put off they pulled off\nan excellent victory against City\nUniversity with ony two out of\nthree players. Thanks go to Pong\nLeung who gave one of their\nplayers only his third defeat of\nthe season.\nThe third team, division five,\nare being more forthcoming with\ninformation this term and are\nshowing that persistence pays\noff. After losing virtually every\ngame last half 5-4, they are now\nputting in good victories. Special\nmention must go to L Sabotinov\nfor his consistent good form.\nThe fourth and fifth teams of\ndivision six are plodding along.\nNot much is known about either\nof the teams except that five beat\nfour in the first week this term\nand then four went to the\nLondon School of Economics\nand scored a good victory over\nthem despite the latter being\nthird in the table. All team lists\nare status quo ante.\n10-PIN BOWLING\nYippee! Good news for once! On\nSaturday the dregs of the IC\nBowling Club went to Heathrow\nto play in the Brunei University\nDoubles Tournament and,\nsurprise surprise, one pair won\nthe competition over about 70\nteams!\nThe tour nam nt was staggered\nover six sessions, all three IC\nteams in the first and fourth\nsessions. At the end of the\nmorning session, the team of\nKevin Short and Andy Yue led by\nover a hundred pins, a huge\namount. A second IC Team,\nChris Wheeldon and Paul\nStewart were lying second.\nAfter a long pub lunch, the\nintrepid six went back to the alley\nfor the last three games, and\nproceeded to play even better\nthan in the morning. Chris got his\nfinger out for once to keep his\nteam in the top three and Ian\nSmith scored a 'freak' high game\nand nearly won the trophy for the\nhighest game of the day.\nIn the end, Kevin and Andy\nwon, with Paul and Chris third.\nKevin also won a trophy for\nhighest series (three games) of\nthe day. All this happened, of\ncourse, against all the principal\nuniversity sides of the country.\nSelf-congratulation all round!\nTeams: Kevin Short and AndyYue, Chris Wheeldon and Paul\nStewart, John Ballard and Ian\nSmith.\nfelIx Friday 1 February 1985\n\n"

I note from the blurb\nthat Anthony Burgess says 'I rejoice and the rest of the\nliterate world will rejoice'.This\npontificating old w anker is\nsurely not without motive in\ndribbling like that. Both he\nand Mr Eco are pop academics, and both make the\nmistake of believing that the\nrandom insertion of snippets\nof scholarship into mediocre\nbooks will convert them into\nart. This makes Burgess'\nmodest claim to be part of 'the\nliterate world' worth rather\nless than his bank balance.\nPerhaps even less than the\nEditor's bank balance, but I doubt it. And while we're on\nthe subject, let's look at an\nexample of the literate chap's work. Earthly Powers is a nice,\nthick, heavy book of the kind\nthat people should donate to\nthe National Union of\nMineworkers. It would help in\ntheir peaceful struggle for the\ndemocratic w oss name to\nchuck this sort of thing at\npolicemen. If anyone made\nthem read it, however, I would\ndefinitely agree that miners\nare horribly oppressed.\nMany authors rely to some\nextent upon 'suspension of\ndisbelief. That is to say, you\nhave to accept the premises of\nthe book to allow the story to\ndevelop. In Earthly Powers the\nreader is asked to believe in\nthe existence of a family\ncomprising two Hollywood\ncel-e bri ties, a homosexual\nnovelist and the Pope. Anyone\nwho swallows that could\ncheerfully believe in a Humber\nBridge made out of Lego. In\nfairness I must concede that\nBurgess does have a point to\nmake about the nature of\nreligion\u2014but a better writer,\nless concerned with sounding\nclever, could have said the\nsame thing in a fraction of the\nspace.\nEnough of the lousy stuff.\nLet's finish on a better plane.\nMany writers have lessons to\nlearn from VS Naipaul. Look\nat Guerillas for a perfect\nnovel, and Among the\nBelievers for perfect travel\nwriting. There is a sound,\n' organic' feel to this structuring. He knits the parts\nof his themes and plots so\nclosely that they might have\ngrown that way. At the same\ntime, he can leave just enough\nloose ends to make the thing\nreal, without damaging its\nsymmetry. The word-by-word\nexcellence of the prose is a joy. Precise. Exact. Right. The\nman never slips. When Salman Rushdie got the\nBooker Prize for Midnight's Children the press were fond\nof saying 'at last, the Third\nWorld has found a voice'. In\nfact, it had just found a political John Irving. Naipaul\nhas the voice worth hearing,\nbut he makes books, not\nheadlines.\n16 Friday 1 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "OPINION j South Africa by IC Anti-Apartheid group\nSOUTH AFRICA\nSouth Africa is a country of immense\nwealth and its white population,\naccounting for 15.5% of the total\npopulation, has one of the highest\nstandards of living in the world. Yet 25%\nof black children die before they reach\nthe age of one, and many more are\npermanently crippled by malnutrition\nrelated illnesses. Education is\nsegregated and the black system is\nopenly designed to prepare blacks for\ntheir second class role: even their\nmakeshift overcrowded classrooms give\nmost black children little more than\nprimary level schooling. Health care is grossly inadequate, with consequent life\nexpectancy of 40-45 years for blacks\ncompared with 70 for whites. Black\nworkers are ruthlessly exploited\u2014with a wage gap of 12:1 in mining for example.\nTheir families, officially designated as\n'non-productive Bantu', are often\nforcibly removed to the barren wastes of\nthe Bantustans. The black community\nhas no political rights, their\norganisations are outlawed and their\nleaders are jailed\u2014removing all\nopportunity for them to change the\nsystem in the ways open to democratic\nsocieties.\nwm\nm The Imperial Coiiege Anti-Apartheid Group\nexists to make people aware of the injustices\nof the Apartheid system in South Africa. The\nsociety sees its main role within IC,. in\ndissuading pe o ole from working in South\nAfrica, or in any way which directly helps the\ncon r in u at i ou of Apartheid.\nRecruitment\nThe South African economy has a continual demand for skilled and\nprofessional workers, which cannot be met\nfrom the white population within the\ncountry. At the same time, however, their is\na high level of unemployment within the\nblack community (21-24%). The system of\njob reservation\u2014which continues despite\nrecent statutory changes\u2014prevents blacks\nfrom taking these posts. Without this strict\nracial demarcation in employment, black\nworkers would require proper education,\nwage gaps would narrow, all peoples would\nstart to compete on equal terms and blacks\ncould even hold positions of seniority above\nwhites. Hence the apartheid system depends\nupon whites being found to fill skilled and\nprofessional jobs\u2014and if those whites\ncannot be found inside South Africa they are\nsought outside.\nThus the recruitment of graduates from\nImperial College for work in South Africa\ndirectly contributes to the frustration of\nblack aspirations, and to the continuance of\napartheid.\nWithin this College job opportunities in\nSouth Africa are not available to all students.\nAlthough for obvious reasons those\nemployers offering posts in South Africa do\nnot publicise racial barriers, such barriers do\nexist. Only white graduates can successfully\napply for jobs in South Africa. It is deeply\noffensive to the many black students within\nthis and other colleges, that the recruitment\nfor these jobs goes on here. Although\nrecruitment to employment outside the UK\nis not covered by the Race Relations Act, it is\nstill, nevertheless, clearly racial\ndiscrimination.\nThis College (particularly RSM) has strong\ngraduate employment, research, and even\neducational links with South Africa and\nCompanies heavily involved in South Africa\nand Namibia.\nNamibia\nSouth Africa's mandate over Namibia ended\nin 1966, since then it has been occupying\nNamibia illegally and enforcing apartheid\nlaws there. Hence working for a company in\nNamibia also helps the continuance of\napartheid both in Namibia and South Africa.\nIn 1966 the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations terminated the mandate\nexercised by South Africa over Namibia. The\ncommission concluded that South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia was illegal.\nThe United Nations Decree for the\nProtection of the Natural Resources of\nNamibia, approved by the General\nAssembly, forbids the kind of operations\nundertaken by companies such as RTZ in\nNamibia. It forbids the exploitation of the\nnatural resources of Namibia without the\nconsent and permission of the United\nNations Council for Namibia and invalidates\nany 'permission, concession or licence' for\nthe exploitation of these resources granted\nby the South African regime or any authority\npurporting to act on its behalf.\nOn 11 February, a speaker from the\nNamibia Support Committee will talk about\nthe Campaign against the Namibian\nUranium Contract (CANUC)\u2014 uranium\nmined illegal y by RTZ in Namibia, for half of\nBritain's civil and military uranium needs.\nFor further information, see the folder\nFacts about South Africa and Namibia' in\nthe careers library, contact AAM, 13\nMandela Street, London NW1 ODW, and\ncome to our meeting.\nFeb 11 \u2014 CANUC\nFeb 18 \u2014 South Africa prisoners of\nconscience\nFeb 21 \u2014 Party \u2014 two live bands\nMarch 4 \u2014 The Church in South Africa\nFELIX Friday 1 February 1985\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FEATURED\nSURROGATE FATHERHOOD\nCash in hand\nEveryone knows that the way to succeed in business is to\nsatisfy a basic human need, and surely no-one would deny\nthat many childless couples want a baby more than\nanything else. But is Harley Street running a 'babies for\nsale' store under a different name? And are IC students\nhelping? A FELIX correspondent reports.\nThe technique of Artificial\nInsemination by Donor (AID)\nhas been practiced in Britain for\nover 40 years. It is responsible for\nover 1000 births per year in this\ncountry alone, and the figure is\nstill rising.\nAID uses donor sperm to\ninseminate women whose\nhusbands are infertile. The\ndonors are carefully screened for\ngenetic diseases, and after\nacceptance they are matched in\nphysical appearance to the\nhusband. Donors must also be of\nreasonable intelligence, and are\noften University students, in\nparticular medics. Donors are\ntypically paid \u00a35-\u00a3 10, and are not\ntold if they have caused a conception, although they will be\nremoved from the list of donors\nafter several successful\npregnancies due to the risk of\nunintentional incest between his\n'children'. The name of the\nwoman's husband appears on the\nbirth certificate, and every effort\nis made to involve him at\ncounselling, conception, and\nbirth.\nThe actual cost of the process\ncan be relatively small, between\n\u00a375 and \u00a3400. Normally only two\nor three attempts at fertilisation\nare required before success, the\nsemen being introduced into the\nwomb at the right stage in the\nmenstrual cycle. The operation\ntakes only about five minutes,\nand a woman can be in and out of\nthe clinic in less than an hour.\nAID children have been the\nobjects of extensive studies. Ten\nyears after birth their families\ntend to be more emotionally\nstable than those of 'normal'\nchildren, and there are relatively\nfew one parent families with AID\nchildren.\n'Height? Eye colour? Hair\ncolour? Build?' The receptionist\ntook my details down over the\nphone. 'Monday at 12.15 OK?'.\nApparently some people are in\nmore demand than others. Do\nyou want your baby to look like\nPaul Newman, Omar Shariff,\nme?\nI arrived quarter of an hour\nearly and took a seat in the\nwaiting room. The others were\neither couples or women on their\nown. A check of their fingers\nrevealed that everyone else was\nmarried. The walls were\nplastered in press cuttings. 'NEW\nHOPE FOR THE CHILDLESS'\n'BORN....THANKS TO\nBOFFINS', the headlines\nshouted good news for the\ninfertile. The women were 25-40,\nmostly typical Guardian readers\nI thought\u2014baggy sweaters and\ncorduroy trousers. They did not\nall seem so affluent. One man had\nthe rough hands of a labourer,\nwhich he kept tightly pressed\nagainst his wife's. One or two\nseemed nervous, tapping their\nfingers against the arm of a chair\nor flicking absent mindedly through the pages of the\nObserver Colour Supplement.\nWould one of these women end\nup bearing my child? A man\nwalked through, his Barclays\nBank Cheque book open.\nMy turn came soon enough. A nurse explained everything\nmatter-of-fact ly. 'Just provide a specimen, and\nwe'll examine it, and ask you a few questions.' She handed me a small disposable plastic\ncontainer, with a clip fit lid.\n'There's a toilet up the stairs'.\nThe new word in medicine is\n'involvement'. If you haven't sat\nin a lab while three nurses sit\nexamining your semen under a microscope then you haven't lived. 'Density is plus two,' one\nsaid. 'White blood cell cov in t is\n15,' said another. I was invited to\nlook down a microscope, and felt\nrather like a schoolboy being\ngiven a guided trip round a museum. As the gang of three\nchecked my virility I began to\nwonder\u2014am I doing right.\nUndoubtedly many students at\nIC have been semen donors. It\ncan be looked on as 'just another\nway of making money'. The\nopportunities available are\nadvertised in the student press.\nHowever, how many students\nhave thought about the ethics\ninvolved? Is it your fault that a baby has been born with a genetically carried disease? It is\ntheoretically possible for\nchildren to trace their genetic\nfather. Do you have a son or\ndaughter that you don't know\nabout?\n'Well, all the tests we've done\nare OK, if you'll just answer a few\nquestions then you'll be finished.\nPossibly the most important\nadvance of civil rights in the UK\nlast year was the passing of the\nData Protection Act. This Act\nallows anyone to see data held on\nthem on a computer, and will\nhave repercussions for IC and its\nstudents primarily because of its\nimpact on examination marks.\nThe Act applies to any data\ndescribing an individual that is\nheld on a computer, and allows\nhim or her to view, correct, and\nerase it (if it is faulty), and claim\ncompensation if it is incorrect.\nThe Act applies to any computer,\nfrom your lecturer's BBC micro\nto ICCC. It is undoubtedly going\nto affect access to exam marks.\nThese have been prepared and\nprocessed on computers for\nmany years, and departments\nwith highly modular courses and\nlarge numbers of students could\nnot operate any other way.\nCurrently, all that is given to a student is a grade. No student is\nable to see the 'raw' examination\nresults, and because of this can\nnot make a sensible appeal. This\nhas the effect of insulating\ndepartments from criticism\nabout the way papers are set and\nmarked. The University of\nLondon even has a regulation\nforbidding the disclosure of this\ninformation, and this regulation\nwill have to be changed in the\nlight of the Act. Colleges will also\nhave to allow access to personal\ndata held on computers such as\nopinions and disciplinary\nrecords.\nAny history of mental illness in\nthe family...are you a homosexual...heavy smoker...\nacademic record?'. Surely I didn't need A level biology\u2014it's not as if I was applying for a scholarship at Cambridge after\nall. Still, the patients are paying,\nand I suppose they expect the\nbest.\n'If you could drop in sometime\nnext week when we finish all the\ntests we'll let you know the\nsituation. We pay \u00a38 during the\nweek, and \u00a311 at weekends \u2014 we\ndon't like using it frozen if\npossible, as it's much better\nfresh'. Thirty seconds later I stood blinking in the sunlight of\nHarley Street, as the Volvos and\nFord Granadas roared up and\ndown. A young woman hurried\npast me, back up the stairs and\ninto the clinic.\n'Good luck' I thought.\nDepartments are now faced\nwith a choice. They can remove\nexamination mark processing\nfrom the computers, comply with\nthe law but change as little as\npossible, or go farther than the\nlaw demands.\nThe former is impossible for\nmost departments for the above\nreason, and the College has\naccepted that examination marks\nwill still be processed on\ncomputers, with all the\nimplications that entails.\nOne option that the College\ncould take would be for each\nstudent to be sent a copy of all the\ndata that was held on him. He\nwould then be invited to\ncomment on it and correct any\nerrors.\nWhether or not this is\nimplemented, there is no doubt\nthat the Act is going to mean that\nCollege will be involved in\nconsiderable expense, to write\nsoftware for all the administrative computers, and the\nsubsequent operation of the\ninquiry system.\nThe new laws will begin to be\nenforced in Autumn 1987, just in\ntime for this year's first years to\nget legal right of access to their\nfinal examination results. The\nbenefits of the Act could be felt\nlong before then, however,\nbecause it may start a significant\nchange in the way Colleges store\nstudent data, leading to a more\nopen, and fairer, system.\nProtecting what?\nFELIX Friday 1 February 1985 5\n\n"

He succeeded\nJohn Heenan in 1976 and was created\nCardinal in the same year by Paul VI.\nCardinals only exist in the Catholic\nchurch and are not, as is commonly\nsupposed, the next rank up after bishop.\nThey need not be bishops but can be\npriests or deacons \u2014 and are drawn from\naround the world and many are stationed\npermanently in Rome.\nAs a cardinal, Basil Hume forms part of\nthe College of Cardinals which acts as an\nadvisory body for the Pope and elects a new Pope as the occasion arises. He may\nalso represent the Pontiff at ceremonial\nfunctions.\nAs senior bishop in England and\nWales, Basil Hume acts as a spokesperson when an official church\nopinion is required on any subject.\nThrough visits around the diocese (such\nas to IC) and discussions with other\nbishops he can advise the Pope on the\nsituation of the Church in this country.\nBasil Hume was born in 1923, a distant\nrelation of the famous 18th century\natheist, sce pti c, philosopher David\nHume. He was ordained in 1950 after\njoining the Benedictine monastery at\nAmpleforth (aRC public school). Whilst\nthere he was both abbot and headmaster.\nLater he took on a number of senior posts\nwithin his order and has lectured in\ntheology.\nHis visit to IC to start Contact Week\nand to lead the ecumenical (ie non-denominational) service is part of his\nefforts to see an end to the divisions\nwhich at present split the Christian\nchurch.\nPROGRAMME\n12.30am Monday/ Tuesday Workshop\nThursday/Friday 12.30am( Each Workshop runs for two lunchtimes, so you\ncan opt for any two workshops in any order.

He consulted the\ncompass and chose the left hand one, being\ncareful not to tread in anything as he had a while back. The continual smell of sewage\nreceded as the tunnel wound its way\nupwards, and the air was getting warmer. He\nlooked at the map again. 'Not far to go now'.\nA faint noise, behind him.

The target was fixed in the cone of light.\nThe Russian's arm flew through the air and\nconnected with the enemy's nose there was a sharp crack and the man's body jerked with\nfits and convulsions. Then he fell, back into\nthe sewer, with a faint s plot h noise. The way\nwas clear.\nAs he continued up the tunnel the Russian\nconsidered his foe. That was no NATO\nguard, he was sure, but one of the Chinese.\nThis was going to be a popular meeting.\nThe end of the tunnel was in sight and the\nspy emerged into a space beneath the steps\nof a large theatre.

Still to look forward to is Rag\nFete in the Summer term, however, to fill in\ntime till then we have started discussing the\norganisation of next year's committee and\nrag week events.\nSince the return of the conference\ndelegates, a major revolt has occured \u2014 no\nlonger shall chairmen have to take the full\nweight of organisation upon themselves. At\nthe conference presentation meeting last\nweek, a media manager and a marketing\nmanager were elected.

And no chance has been missed\nto enjoy the tastier (well, alcoholic) products\nbiotechnology has to offer.\nOne such chance was the first CBS full\nmeeting. The evening was brisk and bright.\nFour excellent speakers (Drs Palmer,\nLangley, Stuckey and Cass) each gave the\n'edited highlights' from their respective\nfields: plant studies, the biotech business,\nchem eng and bio sensors. It was easy to\nshare the enthusiasm for such good\nbiotechnology-and it's all done here at IC!\nSo how will CBS follow the first success?\nMuch behind-the scenes work has been\ndone lining up a programme for the coming\nyear, and it looks very good. It would be a good idea to get in on the act now as recruits\nwill soon have a chance to be on the\ncommittee.

Early letters stand greater\nchance of being published.\nUnsigned letters will not be considered for\npublication.\nTweedledee\nDear Sir,\nThe recent platform given to Sinn Fein by\nthe Socialist Society is a major affront to the\ndemocratic values held by the majority of\nstudents at IC and indicates the moral\ndegeneracy now afflicting the Labour Party.\nThe IRA is a terrorist organisation,\nmatched only by the ANC for its ability to kill\nand maim. It is evil because it ranks the\narma lite higher than the ballot box in\npromoting its beliefs. And it is dangerous\nbecause it will stop at nothing to meet its\nsectarian ends.\nI was at the Conservative Conference in\nBrighton last October and the aftermath of\nthe Grand Hotel bombing filled me with\nnausea, yet fuelled my determination to\ndefeat these animals through peaceful means\nrather than resort to their methods. I welcome the contribution made to political\ndebate by the wide range of speakers at IC,\nbut not for terrorist who have forfeited their\ndemocratic rights by virtue of their actions.\nYours in anger and disgust,\nGraham Brown\nConservative Society Chairman\nRe-apps\nDear Sir,\nHaving been a re-applicant myself this year\nthe recent announcement of the reduction in\nre-apps next year concerns me greatly. Reapps are essential for the social life of the hall,\nespecially in the first term, and a reduction in\nthe numbers of re-apps would only serve to\nfurther overload the remaining re-apps, as\nwell as the wardens and sub wardens. The reason for this announcement as we all\nknow is the imminent closure of the\nFremantle Hotel. The closure of the hotel at\nthe end of the year has sadly resulted in the\ntotal disregard of the 100 current residents\n(myself included) by Student Services, in fact\nStudent Services are tending to support the\nridiculous claims of the owner, who blames\nevery fault, no matter how big, on the\nresidents. Consequently, over the last few\nweeks the building has developed into an\nawful state of disrepair. Ten roofs (at least)\nhave leaked since term began and the heating\nhas been off for the last two weeks, and\nnothing at all has been done to help get the\nplace fixed.\nThe standard attitude at the moment is 'the\nFremantle is shutting in five months, why\nshould we fix it'? This could be understood if\nthe problems were small, but they are not,\nand I can only hope that Student Services\nrealise that the residents of the Fremantle are\nconcerned about the total lack of assistance\nfrom the people who supposedly help\nstudents with accommodation problems.\nYour sincerely,\nKP Gardner\nClarification\nDear Sir,\nThe general response to the issue of human\nrights in Northern Ireland highlighted in\nCollege by the Catholic Society indicates that\nsome clarification of what we were actually\nsaying is necessary.\nIn a personal capacity, and as co-author of\nthe original article in FELIX I would\ntherefore like to make the following points:\n1 The Catholic Society does not support\nSinn Fein. It condemns the violence of the\nIRA, the INLA, the UVF\u2014in effect the\nviolence of all paramilitary groups.\n2 It therefore abhors all deaths and injuries\nand family suffering caused by the conflict.\nThis includes the death of all security force\nmembers. Such happenings are all contrary\nto the teaching of Christ.\n3 It re-in te rates its call of attention to what\nare also serious issues of the conflict \u2014 the\nPrevention of Terrorism Act, lethal mob\ncontrol weapons and unnecessary strip\nsearching of women.\nIt was the unfortunate consequence of the\nlimited space available for our article that it\nmay have appeared in some sense\nunbalanced. It -anyone has any further\nmisgivings on the views we put forward then\nplease do not hesitate to get in touch with me\nor any committee member. All dialogue will\nbe welcomed.\nI would like to conclude by saying that, as a Christian, I find that one of the most valuable\nassets of my faith is that it teaches\nunconditional love and respect. Hardly\nsurprisingly this is the most difficult value to\nincorporate into one's daily life; but I am\nconvinced that unless we learn to take the risk\nof showing love, fairness, respect to our\nenemies then never are we going to see an end\nto violence in this society.\nYours,\nStephen Curry\nIC Cathsoc\nChairman\nPudding\nDear Sir,\nWith the falling pound, and higher interest\nrates, Easter vacations abroad must now\nseem quite unlikely for most students. There\ncan be no doubt this is all part of a capitalist\nlack y running-dogs of Western imperialism\nploy to grind down proletariat students. We\nmust unite in the struggle for a higher pound.\nI cannot have been the only one to notice\nthat Lord Flowers will be an excellent ViceChancellor of the streamlined University of\nLondon after his IC experience of three\nconstituent colleges.\nYours,\nTill the cows come home,\nAlan Pudding (Mr)\nTweedledum\nDear Sir,\nI feel that I must respond to the article in\nlast week's FELIX and clear up a few points\nabout Socialist Society's meeting with a speaker from Sinn Fein. Socialist Society is\ncurrently organizing a number of events\naround the topic of Northern Ireland, since\nwe feel that, as British people, we have a particular responsibility to examine the\nconflict in that region. For too long Northern\nIreland has been a 'taboo', with only repeated\ncondemnations of the IRA's violence being\nechoed, in the almost total absence of serious\ndebate on the issue. One only needs to watch\nthe Party conferences each autumn to see\nhow the subject of Northern Ireland is simply\nignored. If anyone sincerely wishes to see\npeace in Ireland, they must be prepared to\nopen up debate and discussion, and this must\ninclude all the parties involved, however vile\none may find their ideas or actions.\nDuring Human Rights Week Socialist\nSociety showed a film about the Prevention\nof Terrorism Act and brought in an\nexhibition on the use of plastic bullets. These\nevents passed with very low attendance, no\nreports and little reaction. Later this term we\nhave a speaker from the SDLP (which is\nincidentally diametrically opposed to Sinn\nFein) to talk about the New Ireland Forum,\nand this too will pass by without incident or\ncontroversy. What should by now be clear is\nthat our meeting in no way implied support\nfor Skin Fein or the IRA, amd must be seen in\nthe perspective of opening up serious\ndiscussion of the issue.\nAs for the posters being displayed in view\nof the public I would just like to say that when\nthe first posters went up on Wednesday\nmorning we confined them to the Walkway\nand inside departments, for precisely the\nreason that they would not be on show to the\npublic. However, on the Thursday morning\nless care was taken due to the fact that 50% of\nthose that went up on the Wednesday were\ntorn down by some people (whose belief in\nFree Speech is apparently quite selective)\nwithin a couple of hours.\nI hope that this clears up any\nmisunderstandings, and I would like to invite\nanyone with ideas on the subject to come\nalong an'd get involved in Soc-Soc's activities.\nYours sincerely,\nJulian Bommer\nCiv Eng 3\n4 Friday 1 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ECLUBS_\nPHOTOSOC\nMore w hinge ing For those of you who are waiting in eager\nanticipation for the new colour enlarger to\narrive, we have some very disappointing\nnews. It is proving very difficult indeed to get\nthe money off the union. When our request\nwas submitted to the RCC Chairman a week\nbefore the last UFC meeting, we were given\nno indication that it would not be approved.\nThen, at the meeting itself, he refused to put\nour proposal to the committee unless we\ncould state exactly what was wrong with the\nold enlarger and exactly how much it would\ncost to repair, even though we were planning\nto purchase a new enlarger irrespective of\nwhether or not the old one had broken.\n(After all, when drawing up a5 year plan, you\ncan't say exactly when something will need\nreplacing). In these days of financial belt-tightening, however, it seems that this\nargument is not valid, although it must have\nbeen valid when the 5-year plan was drawn\nup.\nAll this is symptomatic of the way\nphotos oc has always been treated by the\nunion. The club has been seriously\nunderfunded for a very long time, just so that\nsome so-called 'prestigious' clubs such as\ngliding or ballooning can be cheaper for their\n(comparatively few) members. Now that the\nfinancial situation is very bad all clubs are\nbeing asked to tighten their belts, but is it\nreally fair to ask everyone to tighten their\nbelts equally when some are already\nsuffering from mal nut rion? There is no\nreason why a well-equipped photographic\nsociety shouldn't bring just as much prestige\nto the union as a gliding club or ballooning\nclub.\nAnd now, more w hinge ing! If you have\nimproperly labelled bottles of chemicals in\nthe darkrooms and you don't want them\nthrowing away, then please remove them\nbefore Wednesday (5 Feb) otherwise they\nwill be. Also, if we find out who it was broke\nthe large masking frame and the contact\nprinter, he (or she) will be receiving a visit\nfrom several large gentlemen from the\nKarate club.\nFinally, the good news! (we've saved the\nbest bit till last!) It may be possible for some\nmembers to go along to press-calls at the\nRoyal Opera House in Convent Garden, but\nnumbers will be limited to one or two people\nat a time, more details later. If anyone went to\nthe RSC press-call last term has developed\ntheir pictures, please bring them to the j committee meeting so we can all see them.\nLastly, there will be another slide show in our\n'Great British Photographers' series in Elec\nEng 408 at 6.00pm on Tuesday 19 Feb, and it\npromises to be really great, so come early to I be sure of getting in!\nQTSOC\nThere was a great wailing and a gnarling of\nteeth and people rent their clothes (tuxedo's, dinner jackets, etc). And it come to pass that\na multitude gathered in the meeting places,\nfor it was the time set for the gathering.\nBehold there came a voice from on high: 'Yea\nverily I say unto thee that Melvyn Bragg will\nspeak to this society on Feb 5'.\nAnd the multitude were agog with the\nwisdom and intelligence of the man and they\nchanted in unison: 'All praise O Tall One!\nThou has fulfilled all thy promises, all praise!'.\nNow amongst the people there was a lowly\nserf who claimed to be secretary, and he\nspoke up timidly \u2014 'Ehm, I hate to spoil a good plot but Mr Bragg will be overseas on\nthat date, to be more explicit, in sunny\nDenmark!'.\nThe crowd were astounded by this feat\nand they shouted in amazement \u2014 'Yea, will\nMelvyn not only speak to us on the date set\naside, but he will address us from Denmark!\nAll Praise! All Pra... hand on a minute'. The\ns crowd became suddenly silent and gazed\nupwards for guidance. The chairman's voice\nboomed out with a distinct Northern accent:\n'I have decided upon a number of options,\n'and he described them in great detail.\nl Send Melvyn a megaphone\u2014cost \u00a350.\n2Buy two dozen return tickets to\nCopenagen \u2014 cost \u00a3108 each from Dan-Air.\n3Arrange for Melvyn to speak to a joint\nQT/Humanities auden ce in the Read\nLecture theatre on Feb 21 \u2014 cost peanuts.\nAnd it came to pass that the crowd voted\nin line with tra dati on \u2014 with their wallets,\nand the final option was chosen by a huge\nmajority of 2-0. There was great rejoicing and\ndancing in the streets and they all lived\nhappily ever after, especially the 'very nice\nboys'.\n?soc\nIn a dark cobweb bed corner of the sprawling\ncomplex, a video screen flickered dimly into\nlife. As a hand moved hesitantly across the\nconsole, pressing a button here, adjusting a control there, other screens sprang into\nwakefulness. On some, faint squiggles and\nhieroglyphics resolved themselves into pink\nwords on a putrid green background. With a muttered oath, the one they called Char-man\n(he liked tea) hurled himself at the colour is er console and wrested with the home ost at on\nthe Anthrax Modulation Subsystem. After a few frantic moments, the screen blazed forth\nonce again in the yellow-on-blue colours of\nThe Service.\nThe FELIX Hack shivered involuntarily.\nAlthough he had volunteered for this\nhazardous mission, indeed had suffered the\ntorments of hy p no surgery to dull his\nresponses to such noisome sights, his skin\ncrawled beneath his p last i mask disguise. He\nshuddered, and prayed be would not be\ncaught. The thought of inquisition by the\ndread pair, the ones known only as RC and\nRP, filled his mind with dread. Why did I ever\nagree to try and find out what STOIC are\nshowing on Tuesday, he asked himself? Just\nthen, a shadow fell across him. He looked up,\nstartled, and a scream died to a gurgle in his\nthroat as he beheld the ravaged features\nbefore him.\nOn struggling back to consciousness, our\nHero found himself manacled to the wall of\nthe dreaded Star Chamber. All hope drained\nfrom him, as he hung limply against the cold\nstone. Fighting to make his eyes obey his will,\nhe focussed on the opposite wall, where\nsomeone had writ t ne 'Nigel Rees in\nconversation on STOIC, OK' with a can of\nspray paint. So that was it! This was the dark\nsecret of Tuesday's Transmission. The\nmaster of graffiti himself! What irony that he\ncould not communicate this information\nback to the office...(to be continued?).\n14 Friday 1 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

A bit weak though.\nMaybe after Combo Zombo\nanything sounds weak!\nCombo Zombo - Chuck in seated on the right\nCINEMA\nAmadeus\nF Murray Abraham, Tom Huke, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy\nDotrice, Jeffrey Jones. Play\nand screenplay by Peter\nShaffer and Directed by Milos\nForman.\nThis rhapsody of a film is\nbased on the life of Mozart\n(according to Shaffer) as\nrecollected by Antonio Salieri,\na composer in Vienna. Salieri\nstruck, in his youth, by an\naf flat us for composition is\ntortured both by the knowledge of his own mediocrity and his ability to\nappreciate the genius of\nMozart. The increasingly\ndisconsolate Salieri becomes\nintent on the destruction of\nthe young Wolfgang Amadeus\nThe film is all very slick, but\nworks rather well. One reason\nmay lie in the quality of the\nperformances. For instance\nAbraham brings out very\nconvincingly the struggle\nbetween light and dark within\nSalieri as well as making his\npain identifiable. Also Huke\nproduces a fine Mozart\nbalancing the childish with\nthe arrogant.\nAnother plus is the music.\nThe alternate dulcet and\ndramatic st ero phonics, piping\nout of the dolby, sound good,\nup-lifting even. But the music\nis neatly tailored to fit the\ndrama and the grandeur,\nwhich is line with the general\nslickness is all cleverly\nphotographed to good effect.\nThe film is sometimes quite\nriveting and often funny, its\ncertainly a banquet for eyes\nand ears. So if you're taking\nthem out for a treat you could\ndo far worse.\nParody 6/ AeSofcGAN\nYeArt^ IT'S FELIX Friday 1 February 1985 17\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSD\nPOSTGRADUATE\nHANDBOOK\nThe first IC Union Postgraduate\nHandbook was published earlier\nthis week.\nThe 32 page booklet is a new\nventure for the Union this year\nand is targeted at final year\nundergraduates who are\nconsidering progressing to an\nMSc or PhD in the coming year.\nThe subject matter covered\nessentially forms an introduction\nto postgraduate life. Areas\ntackled are postgraduate\nfunding, the structure of MSc\nand PhD courses, prospects after\ngraduating and a look at the\npostgraduate way of life, There\nare also personal views from\npostgraduate students on what\nMSc and PhDs are like and lists\nof MSc courses and research\nareas available at Imperial.\nThe Handbook is available\nfree from the Union Office now\nand will become available from\ndepartmental post grad aute tutors over the coming week.\nThe founding editor of the\nHandbook was Hugh Stiles, a Chem Eng post grad and\nChairman of the Union\nRecreational Clubs Committee.\nSubmission rates\ncause concern\nTwo recent surveys have revealed\nthat only an average of 33% of\nPhD students have submitted\ntheses at the end of four years \u2014\none year after the expected\ncompletion date.\nThe surveys published by the\nScience and Engineering\nResearch Council (SERC) and\nthe Economic and Social\nResearch Council (ESRC), detail\nsubmission rates for PhD degrees\nby award holders who began\ntheir research in 1979 and cover\nthe four-year period up to the end\nof 1983.\nUnder the SERC submission\nrates vary between 86.7%\n(Lancaster) and nil (Ulster) with\nan average of 47.8%. IC stands at\n51.9%. For the ESRC the figures\nare between 60.0% and 7.7% with\nan average of 27.2%. The latter\nsurvey does not give a figure for\nImperial because it had less than\nten ESRC award holders for the\nperiod under review.\nThe reasons for this scatter are\ndifficult to pin down. Admittedly\nthe article in last week's FELIX\nshowed that first class and upper\nsecond class degrees are easier to\ncome by at certain universities,\nbut even so the overwhelming\nmajority of students who\nundertake research should be\nacademically able. (A first or\nupper second class degree is a requirement for holding a research council award).\nIt is a fact that if the student\nfails to complete in three years\n(the length of the grant) he often\ntakes up employe ment, rather\nthan write up on social security.\nThe result is that the\nopportunities and incentive to\nwrite up diminish and the degree\nis left uncompleted.\nThe obvious question is why\ndo so may students submit late?\nThe answer must be because they\ndo not leave enough time at the\nend of the project to write up.\nThe SERC have recognised this\nproblem and in the booklet\nResearch Student and Supervisor\n(an approach to good supervisory\npractice) they rec commend that a period of six months be set aside\nfor writing up.\nIt seems certain that the use of\ntransfer theses at the end of the\nfirst year can only help the\nstudent when it comes to writing\nup since at least the core of the\nliterature survey should be\ncomplete not to mention part of\nthe experimental and result\nsections.\nAnother factor with low\nsubmission rates is that fresh\ngraduates are unprepared for the\nrig ours of a three year research\ndegree. Their level of awareness\nof the degree structure (let alone\nthe pitfalls) is often woefully\nin a de qu te. To try and combat\nthis ignorance IC Union has just\npublished the 'Postgraduate\nHandbook'.\nAcademics\nsuffering\ntenure\nitch\nAcademic freedom in Britain's universities could be under threat\nfrom government proposals to\nlimit academic tenure.\nTenure means that academic\nstaff can only be dismissed with\n'good cause', such as extensive\nplagiarism, or assaulting another\nmember of staff. When\nuniversities need to lose staff due\nto grant cuts then this must be\nachieved by natural wastage and\nearly retirement.\nThe government is considering\nlegislation to allow universities to\nshed staff on the grounds of a 'change in fin ani alc irc um stances', or that a given\ndepartment is felt to be of no\nfurther value. Although the\ngovernment claim that 'academic\nfreedom' will not be compromised, the Association of\nUniversity Teachers is opposed\nto the change, saying that 'the\nremoval of tenure will seriously\nweaken the ability of academics\nto deploy their critical and\ncreative faculties in the face of\ngovernmental expediencies'.\nThe AUT fears that measures\nostensibly introduced to help\nuniversities reduce academic\nstaff who can no longer be\nafforded, would allow 'unpopular' members of staff to be\npurged, and make it impossible\nfor academics to fly in the face of\nreceived wisdom about the worth\nof a given area of research.\nResearch would be able to be\nchannelled into specific, possibly\n'safe' areas, and members of staff\nwho disagreed would be able to\nbe removed supposedly on the\ngrounds of financial expediency.\nThe situation is furthur\ncomplicated by the fact that\nImperial College claims that\nacademic staff have no tenure, as\na clause is written into\nacademic's contract of-employment, allowing dismissal\nwith five months notice. This\nhowever has never been tested.\nWhenYou Wanna Go\nWhoYou Gonna Call ?\nThe Farebusters\n\u2022 LOW COST FLIGHTS WORLDWIDE\n\u2022 TRANSALPINO AN D EUROTRAIN\n\u2022 ADVENTURE TOURS\n\u2022 SKI HOLIDAYS\n\u2022ISIC CARDS\n\u2022 WEEKEND BREAKS\n\u2022 TRAVEL INSURANCE\n\u2022 GROUP RATES\nULU Travel\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nTHE JUNIOR COMMON ROOM\nSHERFIELD BUILDING\nPRINCE CONSORT ROAD\nSW7 2AZ TEL: 01-581 8882\nThe World's Greatest Student and Youth Travel Organisation.\nGovernment Bonded under A TO L822 in Association with SATA C Charterers Ltd.\nFELIX Friday 1 February 1985 3\n\n"
