The booklet\ncontains advice on precautions you\nshould take before travelling and\ninformation on how to deal with\nemergencies once you are abroad.\nYou should make sure that you have\nadequate insurance to cover all\neventualities and should seek to\nconsult your doctor at least two\nmonths before travelling if any\nvaccinations are likely to be\nrequired.

I'm afraid that's not\nvery convincing.\nThe comment in the editorial\nwas a statement of intent - what\nshould happen rather than what\ndoes. I have to bend to the wishes\nof my correspondents. But I am\nunclear as to why he bothered to\nwrite the above letter. It wouldn't be because of a deep dislike of me,\nwould it? Surely the President of\nthe City and Guilds Union would\nnot risk dragging the entire\norganisation through the mud\nbecause of an infantile tendency\nto protect his non-existent\nintegrity? That really would be\nstupid. Such a President would be\nrightly considered as able the ring airhead who has done more\ndamage to his Union in the few\nhours a week he spends with it\nthan a College Newspaper editor\never could.

I can match Mr Proctor in\nsnide ness anytime. I have had\nmuch more experience.\n-Adam\nDear Adam,\nRegarding your report on the\nSports Centre Felix 937: When the\nplans for the Sports Centre changes\nwere first mooted, 'the\nmanagement' claimed that by not\ngoing ahead with the plans they\nwere losing x thousands of pounds,\nwhere x was a large number that\nwas considerably more than the\nshortfall between income and\nexpenditure of the Sports Centre.\nWhen I queried this with Valerie\nStraw (facilities manager) I was told\none had to consider the losses in\nterms of opportunity costs. That is,\nalthough the Sports Centre had a shortfall of about \u00a340,000, because\n(so College management claimed)\nit could make say, \u00a3100,000 profit,\nit was actually losing \u00a3140,000!\nI would like to apply this\nprinciple to the loan ICU is making\nto IC for the Sports Centre. If the\nmoney were invested, according to\nmy accountant a return of\n14%\u201420% per annum would be\nexpected, depending on whether the\ninvestment is at home or abroad and\namount of risk. Assume that the UK achieves its target of 4% inflation,\nthen \u00a3650,000 compounded over 12\nyears would be worth roughly\nbetween \u00a32 million to \u00a33.6 million\nat today's rates. The Felix article\ndoes not make it clear how College\nintend to repay the loan. Assuming\nit is repaid in equal instalments of\n\u00a3 5 4 , 0 0 0 and each year ICU invested the returned money on the\naforementioned terms, after 12\nyears ICU would have between\n\u00a31.1 million to \u00a31.6 million. Some\nmay consider my assumptions a little optimistic, however they are\nfar more credible than the Mickey\nMouse business plans put forward\nfor the Sports Centre.\nSo what does ICU get for its\n\u2014 WANTED \u2014\nI'm writing a booklet on\naccommodation and would\nlike to talk to you about your\nexperiences of renting a flat,\nbeds it or mansion. All sorts\nof stories needed-good,\nbad and indifferent-so if\nyou've got a tale to tell,\nplease call me, Liz Carr, on\nextension 8638.\nmoney? You attribute our president\nas claiming that the money will\nprovide better sports facilities.\nWhere are these then? The additions\nare a Jaccuzzi, steam room and\nsauna. Hardly sports facilities.\nAttract better students? This will be\nsecondary, since the prime\nmotivation for the aforementioned\nfacilities is to attract 'middle aged\nexecutives' (quote attributed to\nGordon Marshall in an earlier\nFelix).\nYour article also claims the\nchanges have been agreed with the\nwidest possible consultation. Who\nwas consulted? When the plans for\nthe changes were org in ally put to\nthe College Athletics Committee\nthose present got the impression\nfrom Valerie Straw that student\nviews had been sought and that they\nwere keen on the changes. In fact\nthey did not even know about them\n(a remarkably similar scenario to\nthat on the front page of Felix 937\nregarding car-park privatisation-unions, which also has the\ncommon ali ty of flexible financial\ninformation that can ebb and flow\nto suit the argument of the day, but\nis never available for scrutiny).\nFurther, one should bear in mind\nthat 'consult' does not exclude\n'ignore.' For anyone who thinks\nthat 'the management' would not be\nso dastardly, consider this year's pricing scheme for the Sports\nCentre and the debate, but not\nchange, it caused. And of course\neven higher fees are ont he way.\nThe current management practice is\nthat proposals are first approved by\nmanagement and then the\nconsultation takes place. The fear\nthat this 'consultation' is more akin\nto imposition was voiced at the\nAcademic Staff Assembly last year.\nIt was also claimed that the\nchanges are in the best interests of\nstudents now and in the future.\nDifficult to justify since current\nstudents will not have a Sports\nCentre for five and a half months,\nas for future students, \u00a31 million or\nan old bubble bath? It is a tough\nchoice, but, I think I will go for...\nTwo more little questions: Why\nwas it that the redevelopment was\nsupposed to be done over summer\nvacation\u2014which is only three\nmonths, and now is going to take\nover five? And why has the\nbudget\u2014provisionally of \u00a3350,000\n(Note to MPG1991) shot up to over\n\u00a3650,000, even though the works\nare less extensive than originally\nplanned?\nA.C.

All\nmembers are part of IC Scout and\nGuide Club and have spent the past\nseven months carefully planning the\nexpedition. The area they will be\nvisiting lies at the northern end of\nthe Himalayas in one of the\nrepublics of the former Soviet\nUnion. This area has recently hit\nheadline news in this country as\nmass demonstrations over\ncommunist rule led to violence in\nthe country's capital, Dushanbe.\nThis has since calmed down after\nthe government allowed Muslims to\ntake up ministerial posts, and the\ngeneral feeling in the country is one\nof general relief. There is also a feeling of general relief amongst the\nexpedition!\nThe Imperial College Pamir\nExpedition 1992 will be one of the\nfirst to explore the southern end of\nthe mountains due to the per vio us barriers of Soviet Bureaucracy and\nthe Afghan war, and this has also\nmeant that few Soviet climbers have\nalso reached the region. One of the\nfew other expeditions that have\nreached the Pamirs was that led by\nthe expedition patron, Lord Hunt\n(who led the 1953 Everest\nExpedition) in 1962. These\nexpeditions, however, travelled\nwith the authorities to huge\ninternational camps where most of\nthe peaks are regularly ascended.\nThe Imperial College expedition, on\nthe other hand, will be travelling\nindependently to a much more\nremote area, having built relations\nwith Russian mountaineers and\nTadzhik sci ents ts with whom they\nwill be working with in the\nm out nain s. These contacts have\nalready proved very useful since\nthey have been sent maps of the\narea\u2014none of which existed before\nin Britain since they were illegal to\nposes s before the break-up of the\nSoviet Union, and are still very hard\nto obtain.\nTo reach the area entails two air\nflights, followed by a truck drive on\ndirt-tracks for 150 miles, and then\ntravel on foot and with local animals\nto reach base camp. Since this will\nThe non-climbers will be heading\nthe scientific projects, which will be\ncarried out by all the members (all\nare scientists and engineers) and\nhelped by scientists in Tadzhikistan.\nBotanical material will be collected\nfor the Natural History Museum\nwho have no specimens from this\nHorlicks at 21,000 ft\nPhillip Wickens\ndescribes a forthcoming\nexpedition to the\nHimalayas.\ntake much time, the expedition is\narranging for a Soviet helicopter to\npick them up from base camp for\nthe return journey. From base camp\nthe climbers will set up several\nadvance base camps from where\nthey hope to make the first British\nascents of peaks up to 21,000ft( Mont Blanc is a mere 15,770ft), and to explore the area for future\nexpeditions. The information and\nphotographs that they will bring\nback will be of great value to the\nRoyal Geographical Society, British\nMountaineering Council and Mount\nEverest Foundation, all of whom\nsupport the expedition and are keen\nfor it to go ahead.\nNend-a Bike\n\u2022 BICYCLE REPAIRS \u2022 SALES AND HIRE \u2022 NEW AND USED BIKES \u2022 ACCESSORIES OPEN: 9.00am J.

He befriends\nShirlee as an attempt to expose the\nfact that she is not the college\neducated doctor her image portrays\nher to be. With a little imagination\nyou can figure out the rest.\nA happy ever after story,\ngushing, but thankfully not overly\nsentimental. To end with I must\npass on some advice many poor\nI.C. souls will cherish, 'It's your\nlife, so you've gotta honk your own\nhorn.' Honk away...\nAga\n\u2022 Opens today around London.\nThe Lawnmower Man\nThis is mainly a display of Virtual\nReality - a computer generated\nuniverse where man is limited only\nby his imagination. There is a plot,\nvery loosely based on a Steven King\nshort story, to tie the special effects\ntogether. Pierce Brosman plays Dr\nAngelo, a peace loving virtual\nreality specialist who works for the\nsinister 'shop'. He is encouraged to\ntake a hiatus after his most\nadvanced chimpanzee goes\nrampaging though the corridors of\nthe shop, it's aggression level raised\nto such a point by virtual reality that\nit has to be killed by a security\nguard.\nUpset by the violence in the\nworld around him and left by his\ngirlfriend, Dr Angelo takes the\nsimple Joab, his Lawnmower Man,\ninto his tutor age. The use of drugs\nand a peaceful version of VR produces a highly intelligent, if very\ninnocent, man. So far everything\nhas gone to plan for Dr Angelo until\nThe Shop get interested again and\nsupplant the aggression back into\nJoab.\nThis is where Dr Angelo's dream\nof a superior peaceful human race\nfalls to pieces and Joab's decision\nof his own destiny to Tu le the world\nas a benevolent dictator take over.\nJohnny Suede is another film which\nopens this Friday. I saw this movie\nlast term so my recollection of it is\nnot terribly good. Anyhow, I 'll try\nmy best.\nCompared to Straight Talk it is\nnot your usual American\ncommercial movie. It is more on the\nlines of an off-beat Jim Jarmusch\nfilm. Written and directed by Tom\nDiCillio, starring Brad Pitt of the\nLevi's advert where he walks out\nof jail in his boxer shorts.\nA darkly comic fable, packed\nwith the symbolism of objects and\ndreams. Set in the shadows of a modern American metropolis- it\nlooked more like a deserted area of\nruined tenement buildings.\nJohnny Suede (Brad Pitt) is a poor, naive and not quite a musician\nwith a12 inch hair-style. Johnny\nmeets and falls in love with Darlette\n(Alison Moir). Their relationship\ndoesn't last as she is involved with\nan older,quirky man. As he tries to\nkeep his band together, Johnny\nmeets Yvonne (Catherine Keener).\nYvonne is warm, caring and\ngenerous-the complete opposite to\nDarlette. An uneasy relationship\ndevelops between them which\nbegins to threaten Johnny's illusions\nof himself.\nThe characters are well written,\nthough the pace of the movie is\nslow. At times it was strange when\ndream sequences are used to\nexpress Johnny's intuitive response\nto the changes in his life. But they\nproved to be rather interesting. On\nthe whole it is well directed and\nsuitably acted.\nAga.\n\u2022 Opens today at the Chelsea\nCinema and around London.\nJeff Fahey's performance as the\nsimpleton turned genius is engaging\nand Pierce Brosman's scientist\nlooks very harassed but very\nunconvincing in the intimate scenes.\nThe film itself does not raise many\nquestions for us to mull over as we\nleave the cinema since the effects\nare all that hold it together.\nThe Phantom\n\u2022 T/ ie Lawnmower Man opened\nlast Friday and is currently showing\nat the MGM cinema. Kings Road.\n\u2014 6 \u2014\n\n"

Come to think of it, for\na while this evening sitting on the\nMarquee staircase while they\nplayed also seemed like a better\nproposition. However, it came to be\nthat I was led (some would say\ndeceived) into standing slap bang at\nthe front middle of the stage when\nScorpio Rising appeared. The point\nis, and you don't know how much\nit pains me to say this, but Scorpio\nRising were...erm...good. Very\ngood actually.

I was\nhowever later informed by a friend\nthat these feelings of chronic\nex hi le ration and exhaustion\nfollowed by acute as phi xi ation may\nhave been a result of too much fizzy\nlager, constant manic dancing and\nbugger all ventilation. While all\narguments are, I admit, perfectly\nreasonable, I still blame my own\nnear death experience on the band\nthemselves. When I saw them at\nReading last year they easily stole\nthe show from the other so-called\nheadliners. Somehow though, the\nthreat of new material made a repeat\nperformance seem a little unlikely.\nOops! Big mistake! Major\nmisconception.

    "content": "News Felix 938 12 June 1992\n'Stop theft' call Medical poll\nStudents have again been asked to\nguard their belongings while in\nCollege buildings. The advice\nfollows three mysterious cardigan\nthefts earlier this week. The\ngarments were contained in separate\nbags stolen from outside the Maths\ndepartment library on Tuesday\nafternoon. The bags also contained\ncheque books, cheque cards and\nCollege security cards. The Maths\ndepartment, unlike Chemical\nEngineering and Chemistry, does\nnot provide lockers for students\nusing the departmental library.\nCollege Deputy Security chief,\nTerry Briley, told / CNN that\nstudents who lose their swipe cards\nshould contact Sherfield Security\nimmediately on extension 3372.\nThe thefts come after two\nincidents on Friday night. The Fire\nBrigade arrived at Beit Quad just\nafter midnight in answer to a hoax\ncall. The call is believed to have\nbeen made from the telephone box\nbeside the Royal College of Music\n(RCM), and the hoaxer is reported\nto be a student of the RCM who was\nevicted from the Quad by duty\nofficers earlier in the evening.\nThe second incident occurred in\nthe Prince's Gardens area, when a beer glass was thrown from the roof\nof Southside Bar to the pavement\nbelow. The assailant is believed to\nhave thrown the glass from between\nstaircase 3 and 4, on the third level\nof Tizard Hall. This follows an\nattack two weeks ago, when a police van was damaged by a glass\nthrown from the same area. The\npolice had been called to investigate\na fictitious fight outside Southside\nBar. Police are reported to be\ninterested in enforcing the Southside\nBar licensing laws following the\nincident. (/CNN).\nCVCP cash plea\nThe Committee of Vice Chancellors\nand Principals (CVCP) has asked\nthe government for an extra \u00a3450\nmillion. The CVC P, which\nrepresents the heads of all UK universities, stated that \u00a3165 million\nwas needed to improve pay of\nexisting academic staff and another\n\u00a339 million would be needed for\nnew staff to teach increased student\nnumbers.\nThe report also stated that over\n\u00a395 million would be needed in\neach of the next three years to bring\nuniversity buildings up to a safe\nstandard. The committee also\nrecommended that hardship funds\nCouncil elections\nshould be increased by 10% above\ninflation per annum.\nThe move is in the light of\npolytechnics being granted\nuniversity status. Polytechnics can\nnow apply direct to the University\nFunding Council (UFC) and will be\nin direct competition for funding\nwith universities. The polytechnics\nwould be very capable of competing\non equal terms with the established\nuniversities as their annual intake is\ntwice that of universities.\nPolytechnics currently teach more\nthan half of higher education\nstudents. (Independent)\nA meeting of the Joint Imperial\nCollege Union Council will be held\nin the Union Dining Hall on\nThursday 25 June at 2.00pm. Candidates eligible for election to\nthe College Committees have been\nnotified that applications must be\nreturned by Thursday 18 June. The\nelections are for posts in the College\nCommittees on Departmental\nComputing, Radiation Safety,\nUndergraduate Studies, Wine,\nHumanities, Safety Council and Bar\nand Catering. The post of Council\nchairman will also be filled at this\nmeeting. (/CNN).\nSupercollege\nThe Government has granted\npermission for the foundation of a 'Super-College' in Sheffield. The\nnew college, which will cater for\n44,000 students, will be created by\na merger of six of the city's further\neducation colleges. The\namalgamation of the existing\ncolleges should be finished by April\n1993.\nThe new college will teach\nacademic and vocational courses to\nalmost all of the city's sixth-form\nstudents, as well as providing a large number of adult education\ncourses. It will be the second largest\neducational establishment in\nBritain, with the University of\nLondon, including Imperial,\nremaining the largest.\nIt is reported that the decision was\ntaken to stop potential competition\nbetween colleges once they became\nresponsible for their own finances.\nIt is thought that the larger\ninstitution will be able to obtain\nfunding more easily from a new\nfurther education funding council.\n(Guardian).\nThe operation of the Patient's Charter is to be smoothed by a new\nsurvey launched at St Mary's Hospital Medical School. The\nnationwide inquiry is to examine the\nquality of care in hospitals from a patients perspective by asking what\nthey think of their treatment. A questionnaire will be sent to five\nthousand patients in 36 randomly\nselected hospitals, and the results\nare expected to help hospital staff\nmeet charter standards.\nThe survey is being funded by a15 month grant worth \u00a3284,548\nfrom the Board of Directors of The\nCommonwealth Fund. North East\nThames, North West Thames,\nOxford and Yorkshire Regional\nHealth Authorities are funding the\ncost of surveying additional\nhospitals within their areas.\n(/CNN).\nLecturer pay hit\nImperial College lecturers are\nfacing the prospect that their future\npay rises will be linked to their\nteaching abilities in lectures and\nseminars. The possibility of\nperformance related pay has\nincreased following a letter from the\nDepartment for Education to\nlecturers' employers. The letter\nsuggests that education ministers\nare urging the introduction of civil\nservice style pay checks, where\nindividual performance is ranked\nannually on a one to five scale, and\nawarded con sequentially in the pay\npacket.\nThe letter emulates the ideals\nexpressed in the Citizens' Charter,\nlaunched by the Prime Minister in\nJuly 1991. At the Charter launch,\npay review bodies were exhorted to\ntake more account of performance\nwhen assessing pay claims in the\npublic sector. At the time, this\nmeasure was implicitly targeted at\nBritish Rail and London\nUnderground employees.\nPerformance related pay was one of\nthe constituent elements in the\nproposed Students' Charter. The\nidea was originally floated in\nDowning Street last January, and\nwill be discussed again on June 19.\nThe plan had the support of the then\nEducation Secretary, Kenneth\nClarke, and this enthusiasm is\nshared by the current Education\nSecretary, John Patten.\nThe letter follows work by senior\nacademics which questions the\nentire thinking behind performance\nrelated pay. Derek Torrington, of\nthe University of Manchester\nInstitute of Science and\nTechnology, has alleged that there\nis no evidence to suggest that\nrelating pay for academics to\nperformance in teaching or\nlecturing would lead to higher\nstandards in either. He suggests that\nperformance related pay tends to\nde motivate the majority of the\nworkforce. 'An examination of\nschemes running in eight large\norganisations suggests that\nperformance-related pay seldom\nachieves what its advocates claim\nand can present considerable\nproblems,' writes Mr Torrington.\nStaff appraisal currently exists in\nthe university sector, having been\nintroduced in 1987. At the time of\nintroduction, an undertaking was\ngiven that appraisal was not to be\nlinked with promotion or\ndisciplinary matters. Appraisal is\nonly used in deciding the pay\nawards to polytechnic heads of\ndepartments and senior staff. The\nletter from education ministers is\nthe first formal connection between\nappraisal and university pay levels.\nThis new connection is set against\nthe background of continual\ndisruption in the university pay\nnegotiating system. The 1991/2\nuniversity pay round has not yet\nbeen approved by the Government,\nwith the Association of University\nTeachers ( AUT) delaying\nperformance related salaries by\nhaving the matter referred to a working party.\nThe AUT has not reacted\n'author it iv ely' to the performance\npay letter, as it 'was not addressed\nto the AUT.' Speaking to / CNN, the AUT stressed that the 1991/2\npay agreement negotiated with\nemployers 'already takes full\naccount of the Government's declared interest as detailed in the\nCitizen's Charter.' They added that\nthe AUT 'policy making council has\nfor some time spoken its clear\nopposition to discretionary pay,'\nthough Government ministers are\nreported as believing that the deal\ndoes not go far enough. In\nparticular, they have singled out the\nfigures of an across the board rise\nof 6%, compared with a discretionary element of only 1 %.\nThe Education Department letter,\nwhich has been described as having\nthe Treasury's finger marks 'all\nover it', firmly states that it is trying\nto introduce performance related\npay 'within the context of a pay\noffer no greater than it otherwise\nmay have been.' This suggests that\nlecturers may be facing a pay cut\nif they do not pass appraisal tests.\n(/CNN)\nFelix is produced for and behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road.\nLondon SW7 2BB.( Tel: 071-225 8672).

Her feminine eye is\nsupervising Eat's every move, and\nher head is touching the ceiling. Not\nthat Eat actually make that many\nmoves that need supervising. It\ntakes Ange (the lead singer, a he,\nfind out why he's called Ange next\nweek) three songs to introduce the\nband. 'Hello, we're Eat.' Oh, now\nthere's a surprise. He follows this\nextra v agn za of crowd interaction\nwith 'Bellytown', the first really\ngood song of the night.\nAfter this, he becomes more\ninvolved, baiting the audience with\nRick Astley jibes, prowling a round\nthe stage in a game of one man\npeek-a boo, and leading the band\nthrough the set, highlights being\n'First Time Love Song', 'Fatman'\nand the obligatory 'Golden Egg'.\nEat are a feverish experience and\nwell worth catching.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 \u00a3af play at the Town & Country\nClub tomorrow night. The single\n'Golden Egg' is out now on\nFiction/Polydor.\nCud, Sensitize\n-Underworld\nThe first half of Sensitize's set is\nrather same y and monotonous, with\none song being virtually\nindistinguishable from another, and\nonly 'Try' standing out. But then,\nabout half way through, they get\ntheir act in order, and with their last\nfour songs, 'Untitled', 'Falling\nThrough', 'Beautiful Home' and\n'Watertight', they introduce\nvariety, life, and humour (with their\nclosing comment, 'If you want to\nabuse us, abuse us. That's what\nwe're here for.'). If only they could\nkeep this up throughout the set.\nFirst on the stage is Steve, the\ndrummer from Cud, music press\nfigure of ridicule, closely followed\nby the rest of the band. Lead singer\nCarl gets cries of 'fat bastard' which\nhe quells most succinctly. Last time\nI saw Cud, in December 1990,\nCud missile.\npositioned as they were in a Ned's Stuff ies sandwich, they sucked it\nbig time. Now on major label, they\nare almost transformed. But any of\ntheir songs could break into 'Rich\nAnd Strange', their well-deserved\nchart hit. Is it just a characteristic\nsound, or do all their songs sound\nexactly alike?\nAnd after that song, when the\nephemeral fans have drifted off,\ntowards the end of the set, I feel an\nunwilling smile creep across my\nface. Carl Puttnam has control of\nmy face muscles and I want it. He\nalso has the world's worst line in\nanecdotes, which generally consist\nof for filling his submarine fetish.\nAfter this, a hint of variety creeps\ninto their set too, closing with the\nserene 'Love In A Hollow Tree',\nwhich itself concludes with a drum\nsolo.

Sod that, most of the first\nside is about that particular radio-friendly subject.\nSo, assuming you keep this album\naway from grandmothers, Radio 1\nDJs and other sensitive types, and\nDel Amitri\nyou never meet Lesley Silverfish in\na 'Silverfish are crap' t shirt, what\ncan you expect to hear on this\nalbum? A solid wall of noise,\nchunks of guitar from Mr Fuzz,\n(not, I am assured, the Mr Fuzz of\nPWEI), 'Piqsqueal' from 'Fuckin'\nDrink or What?' ep, a cover of\nDavid Essex's 'Rock On'. (David\nEssex!), the rather excellent 'Joos'\n(as in orange) and, if you're quick,\na free 7\" single with live version of\n'TFA'.\nSo what are you waiting for? Oh\nright.

There's none of\nthat 'beloved misty glen' syndrome\na la Runrig nor even a mention of\n'wee dram' or a 'bleak city' (i.e. Glasgow), all of which seem to be\nbecoming consistent themes of\nScottish bands these days.\nDel Amitri are rising to the\nJerry Burns\n-Jerry Burns\nstature of Deacon Blue, in that\nevery track has the potential of\ncharting successfully. Currie's voice shines through 'Always the\nLast to Know' and 'Just Like a Man'.

    "content": "Furse Row as Southside faces demolition\nReports on a split in College\nManagement over the decision to\nbuy Furse House have not been\ndenied by Mr Angus Fraser, the\nCollege Managing Director. Furse\nHouse is the former Ministry of\nDefence hostel situated on Queen's Gate Terrace which may be bought\nas IC student ac como dati on. The\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, is reported to\nhave clashed with Mr Fraser and\nDirector of Estates, Gordon\nMarshall, over the purchase.\nSir Eric recently told (CNN that\n'it would be a thousand pities' if the\nhall went to another institution, and\nthat he would 'give an arm and a leg' to buy the hall. The college\nneeds to raise \u00a33 million to pay for\nthe hostel. This sum is regarded as\nextravagantly high by both the\nFinance and Estates divisions of\nCollege, and the Directors of these\ndivisions are reported to believe that\nthe already over stretched Residences accounts could not cope\nwith this additional burden. Mr Fraser told /CNN last night that 'the\neffect of the purchase on the\naccounts cannot be ignored.'\nThe dispute came to a head before\nthe Residences Strategy Working\nParty meeting yesterday. The\nmeeting was due to approve a residence report drawn up by the\nWorking Party which included the\nbudgets for the residences accounts\nfor 1990/1 and 1991/2. (CNN has\nlearned that the loss shown on the\n1992 budget was to be used by the\nopponents of Furse House to argue\nagainst the purchase.\nThe residence report was heavily\ncriticised by wardens and\nsub wardens of several college\nresidences who drew up an eight\npage document detailing factual\ninaccuracies in the residence report.\nProfessor Geoff New, the chairman\nof the Advisory Group of\nResidences, who also sits on the\nWorking Party, threatened\nresignation from the Working Party\nif his name was not removed from\nthe report. Prof New refused to\ncomment on this allegation, but\nstated that he had not been directly\ninvolved with writing the\ndocument. Sir Eric Ash who was\ndescribed as 'cold with fury' over\nthe wardens' response, used these\ninaccuracies to cancel the\npublication of the residence report,\nand it was not discussed by the\nmeeting.\nThe news of the Rector's decision\nwas broken to the Working Party by\nAngus Fraser. It is believed that the\nRector briefed Mr Fraser in a meeting on Tuesday afternoon, but\nthe decision to effectively stop the\nreport came as a surprise to most\nof those present at the meeting\nyesterday (Thursday). Mr Marshall\nwas reported to have been\n'flabbergasted' and afterwards was\noverheard to remark that Mr Fraser\nhad not briefed him on the Rector's decision.\nSpeaking to (CNN, Mr Fraser\nsaid that some comments had been\nmade at the meeting about the\nreport. 'There were some\nquestions, mainly about the\npresentation of the report and the\nstrategic aims of the report,' he\nsaid, adding that following the\nRector's intervention, the figures in\nthe appendices to the report were\nbeing 'revised'. 'The report will\nthen be issued to the original\ndistribution,' he said.\nMr Fraser said that the report\n'will be worked on between now\nand the autumn.' Opponents of the\npurchase of Furse House are\noutraged at this timescale. They\npoint to sealed bids having to be\nentered for the property by 8th July,\nand say it is no accident that the\nreport has been deferred until so\nlong after the Furse House decision\nhas been made. Mr Fraser refused\nto deny that he had difference of\nopinion with the Rector over the\npurchase. 'We are clear on the\nprogramme on which we are\nworking,' he added.\nThe purchase of Furse House is\nof strategic importance in what is\nunderstood to be a plan to demolish\nthe Southside Halls of Residence.\n(CNN has learned of a discussion\ndocument which suggests the\nreplacement of Southside with a conference centre. We understand\nthat the Southside Halls were given\na twenty five year lifetime when\nthey were built over twenty seven\nyears ago. There are currently\nreports that the foundations of the\nhalls are beginning to crumble,\nthough no-one from Estates was\navailable for comment on the story\nyesterday.\nThe suggestion was fuelled\nearlier this week when it was\nannounced that Simon Westerman,\nCollege Catering Manager, had\nproposed the closure of the Gardens\nRestaurant, and the moving of\nSouthside Bar and Belushis to the\nSherfield building.

As I am\nnot bound to this place for much\nlonger, there are no restraints on my\nbeing appallingly rude to people\nhanding things in late. If anybody\ncomes in with an article after\nMonday, I will tear it up in front\nof them and ram the pieces where\nthe sun don't shine.\nCredits\nDeclan, Stefs R and S, Simon,\nPoddy, Catherine, Mario, Sam,\nRose, Jonty, Ian, David, James,\nScott, Andy, Steve, Ian, the flying\nflow and the Baskerville Bastard.\nWhen up in Scotland, this quaint word I come upon\nI have to snip it short, and call it scone.\nAnd yet we have a Coronation Stone\nBrought down from Scotland from a place called Scone,\nWhere toasted cakes with butter spread thereon\nAre called by the same name, but ry hme d with shone.\nBut down in England's Southern Shires, when I'm alone,\nI love soft, mellower sounds and call it scone.\nCharles.\nHUB'S Midsummer\nThe Enemy Within's Response Answered\nDear Adam,\nFor the benefit of IC ConSoc, a brief summary of 'The Enemy\nWithin.'\n1. The implementation of the\nstudents' charter now looks\nimminent. It will be discussed at a meeting in Ten Downing Street on\n19 June.\n2. Conservative Students are setting\nthe pace in student reforms, and are\nexercising an influence far in excess\nof their status.\n3. The students' charter will be used\nby Conservative Students to launch\nyet another attack on the NUS.\n4. This attack is euphemistically\nknown as voluntary membership.\n5. Voluntary membership will\nseriously, if not fatally, damage all\nstudents unions, threatening all the\nactivities and societies that they\nfund.\n6. IC ConSoc received \u00a3520 of\nunion money last year and has bid\nfor \u00a3535 this year.\n7. It is not unreasonable to assume\nthat this money will be partially\nused to campaign for voluntary\nmembership.\n8. In this way, ConSoc is using\nunion money to seriously damage IC\nUnion. ConSoc is the 'enemy\nwithin'.\nNow compare this with the points\nof relevance in their letter of last\nweek:\n1. IC ConSoc does not use union\nmoney to affiliate to the\nConservative Party in any form.\n2. IC ConSoc does, however,\naffiliate to the Greater London Area\nConservatives, at the cost of \u00a310\nfrom ConSoc membership\nsubscriptions.\n3. Money received from the union\nis not used to stimulate greater\nstudent interest in centre-right (sic)\npolitics.\nSuch pathetic evasion. If ever\nthere was a letter that failed to\nanswer an article, this is it. The\nletter says nothing, absolutely\nnothing, about the students' charter,\nthe influence of Conservative\nStudents in setting Government\npolicy, or the effects of voluntary\nmembership.\nThe information which I gave\nabout affiliation to Conservative\nStudents came from both the\nchairman and national secretary of\nConservative Students, in live\ninterviews broadcast on IC Radio.\nTo be absolutely sure, I had this\ninformation verified by a former\nchairman of IC ConSoc.This year's ConSoc chairman doesn't seem to\nbe aware of his own position. Is\nMark fully aware of the facts?\nAs for centre right politics, what\nexactly is he talking about? Centre\nright normally means right of\ncentre, and that certainly isn't ConSoc. If Mark is redefining\ncentre right as right of centre,\nsurely even that is just a tad socialist\nfor the offshoot of the Federation\nof Conservative Students?\nThe personal attacks are best\nignored. Being a firm follower of\nthe Guardian's Will Hutton, I regarded the 1992 election as one\nto lose. Incidentally, anything about\nthe collapse of IC Labour should be\nreferred to Mark Schaeffer.\nPerhaps ConSoc will make a more constructive response in\nfuture. Hopefully, they won't take\nso long about it next time.\nWishing you fruitful travelling in\nthe land of the East. Enjoy your\ndeserved retirement (OBN),\nDeclan Curry.\n(Still) News Editor.\n3 \u2014\n\n"

A young lady\nof considerable fortune is supposed\nto marry someone chosen by her\nbrother. Wanting to meet him and\nfind out his 'real self, she disguises\nherself as Chevalier, becomes his\nfriend, and seduces his mistress. It\nis a complex play in which no one\nis simply in love, but everyone has\na lust for financial gain; the\naristocrat Lelio whose criterion for\nmarriage is the yearly earnings of\nthe bride and Trivelin the servant\nof Chevalier who is ready to sell\nevery secret he knows or he thinks\nhe knows. Each character puts on\na mask in order to impress and\nmanipulate. Crispin Redman as\nLelio and William Hope as Trivelin\nplay their parts excellently. The\nsettings of the play are interesting\nand together with the music and the\ncostumes they help to create the\natmosphere of the period. However\nthe acting of two of the main\n'Darling can I eat your earring ?'\ncharacters is a bit disappointing.\nZorbas.\n\u2022 The False Servant is showing at\nthe Gate Theatre (above Prince\nAlbert pub, 11 Pembridge Road,\nNotting Hill) from June 3 to July 4\nat 7.30pm.

He gets recruited\nby a research team trying to relearn\ntechnology and ends up discovering\nmessages are coming from Orbit.\nSurprise, surprise, after a millen i a of silence, Earth has come back.\nThis book is described as being\nrich in atmosphere, characters and\nideas. To be quite honest, I found\nit boring. Halfway through,\nMathias has only just joined the\nresearch team with no sign of earth\nwhatsoever. The plot isn't rich, just\ncumbersome and in the end I put the\nbook down and didn't pick it up\nagain. This is the first book in a two\nbook series. I'm not going to be\nbuying number two. The ideas are\nold, the characters lack character\nand the atmosphere is non-existent.\nI can only as ume the author knew\nthe publisher.

It is not all laughs,\nthough, and the ending leaves you\nin a thoughtful mood.\nThe characters are very easy to\nidentify with, each one having\nrecognisable echoes of us all. A whole gamut of ages is presented,\nfrom early teens to early twenties,\nFishing for compliments\nreflecting the difficult stages of\ngrowing up.\nThe acting was excellent at all\ntimes, and the set was extremely\nwell designed and put together.\nWatch out for the pond!\nThis is brilliant!

    "content": "12 June 1992 Felix 938 Reviews\nLove & A Bottle Grave\nLondon, 1700, a little known Irish\nplaywright is trying to survive in a world seemingly populated by\nscatterbrained fops and their\nmatching empty headed women.\nThe critics hate him, he owes his\nlandlady umpteen weeks back rent\n(to be payed in sexual favours if he\ncan't scrape the money together).\nGeorge Lyric is on the way down.\nBeing a man of some dignity he\ndecides to bring as much of the\nworld crashing down with him. He\nstarts to write a play featuring the\nfops of the day (as every other play\nwritten by his contemporaries). The\nfat pigeons strut their stuff on the\nstage, while the playwright\nintroduces one final character; a fox\nknown as George Roebuck, a man\nwith as few morals as the fops, but\nlacking their 'all for one' principles\nof comradeship and camaraderie. In\nother words a dangerous man.\nRoebuck, having left two lovers\nand a bastard son in Ireland, comes\nto London to escape his\n'attachments'. Unfortunately, all\nthree follow him to the Capital. The\nresult is a comic and often black\nfarce involving not only the lovers\nbut their relations, all of which get\nembroiled in the complex plot of\nlies and seduction. George Lyric,\nFalstaff\nthe playwright appears on stage\nfrom time to time, to moderate his\ncharacters, but fails to keeps\nRoebuck under his control.\nWritten by George Farquhar and\nadapted by Declan Hughes, this is\none of best farces I have ever seen.\nIt manages to retain a serious thread\nthroughout its length, and Rough\nMagic (the theatre company)\nmanages to change smoothly from\nshallow comedy to serious drama.\nAn excellent performance by\nPhelim Drew as George Roebuck.\nStef.\n\u2022 Love and a Bottle is showing at\nthe Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn High\nRoad. It is running until the 27th June and tickets can be bought from\nthe box office on 071 328 1000.\nThe play is about a family dealing\nwith the loss of one of its members.\nThe deceased father figure is a vicar, and so the subject of the play '\nis supposed to be the collapse and\nregeneration of faith...\nUnfortunately a play needs much\nmore than a dead vicar in order to\nattempt an intricate subject such as\nhuman faith. The scenes are too\nnumerous and short to develop any\nmeaningful point. All the usual\npsycho lg ical profiles were present:\nthe son, suffering from acute\nOedipus complex, the mother,\nrediscovering sex, the rebellious\ndaughter...All too typical!\nFortunately Mary Peates, the\ndirector of the play, manages to\nmake full use of the potential\npresent in actors such as Ben\nRobertson, thus enhancing the few\npositive points in the text. These\nusually consist of humorous\ndialogues about the marital status of\nthe different characters or\nmonologues about the church.\nIf you're going to see a play this\nweek, see one of the others on this\npage.\nM.A. \u2022 Playing until 20th June at the\nFinborough Theatre Club (above\nthe pub), 8pm, Monday to\nSaturday. Tickets are \u00a36 to \u00a34 from\nthe Box Office (071-373 3842)\nAt the heart of Verdi's Falstaff, the\nfat, philandering knight of the title,\nhaving failed in a seduction attempt,\nis flung into the Thames in a basket\nof dirty laundry. In ENO's revival\nof Verdi's final opera, Benjamin\nLuxon's portrayal of Falstaff's transformation from overweening\npomposity to abject, wheezing\npanic, and a coup de theatre from\nproducer David Pountney unlock\nthe full comic potential of this\nfamous scene. At other points\nduring the evening, however, the\nproduction is slightly less successful\nat tapping the vein of hilarity that\nruns through the work.\nMusically, all is well and much\nis first rate. Luxon's Falstaff is\nwell- rounded in every sense, his\nample tone matching his girth, his\nacting capturing the larger than life\nexuberance and appetite his role\nrequires. Outstanding amongst the\nfour ladies are Susan Bullock as\nMistress Ford, for her beautiful\ntone and clear diction, and Alison\nHagley's sparkling Nanetta.\nBonaventura Bottone, as the latter's lover Fenton, though vocally secure\nand pleasing, is rather less\ncharacter ful. In the pit, Mark Elder gives a detailed, well-balanced reading of\nVerdi's orchestral score; the singers\nare never overwhelmed and subtle\nmasterstrokes such as the doubling\nof piccolo and cellos in the first\nscene are tellingly realised.\nPatrick Wood\n\u2022Falstaff at the Coliseum, St\nMartin's Lane, at 7.30 on the 15th,17 th and 20th of June. Tickets from\n\u00a34 on the day.\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
