    "content": "Don't miss out on this invaluable experience: you may think that three or four years is a long time\nwill soon be gone. Start now, today, this weekend.\nThe British Museum\nBorn by a Parliamentary act of 1753 its origins and\nfounding material were i ncep ted by the library and\ncollections of Sir Hans Sloane. His collections,\nbequeathed to the nation, were soon joined by the\nsubsequent acquisition of the Cottanian, Harleian and\nother libraries, forming a nucleus housed in Montague\nHouse by 1759. Rapid expansion ensued in this great\ninstitution and led to the construction of the present\nbuildings, designed by Sir Robert Smirke, who also has\nthe Covent Garden Theatre to his name.\nIts exhibits are often colossal and this matches the\nexternal fabric of cont ruc tion in its Doric style, most\nmagnificently exemplified in the Parthenon in Athens.\nIn itself the building is a collection of architectural\nideas, opinions and practicality, consuming the\npassion of a multitude of designers over the course\nof two and a half centuries. Their own input was\ndirected as much by personal imagination as by public\nopinion and practicality of use.\nTo many, the idea of a museum conjures up the\nexcitement of stalking slugs from one end of a garden\npath to the other, and indeed as a child not only my\nfeet complained bitterly of pain and boredom.\nHowever, this background history was surmounted by\na recent visit to the British Museum after a lapse of\nsome twelve years.\nBritain's largest classical building has acted as the\nroot and parent of many institutions in the course of\nits life. The best known to you all is the Natural History\nMuseum down the road which transferred to South\nKensington in 1881. The British Library also began at\nMontague House and has now resided on an adjoining\nsite since 1971. The Library, which receives a copy\nof every publication in the UK (even FELIX), illustrates\nthe problem of collecting in such magnitude. Although\nits collection of provincial and London newspapers is\nhoused in Colindale, it requires over three miles of new\nshelving each year and the demand for space is\naccelerating. A new library is planned in the Kings\nCross area with 60ft of sub terran ian floors before\nheading skyward.\nThe British Museum, through its numerous\ncollections of ancient, med aei val and modern objects,\nnot only charts the broader aspects of world history\nbut, integral ly with it, the personal history of its\ncollectors, contributors, patrons and public in modern\ntimes. For example the Library's Round Room has\nplayed host to Karl Marx, the Kings Library to\nMacaulay, and Keats found inspiration in\ncontemplating the Elgin Marbles.\nThe concept of the museum dates back beyond the\ntimes of the Ancient Greeks, Egyptian Pharoahs and\nRoman conquerors, although these people began to\nput them into a public perspective. Between them\nthey represent three differing aims and ideas. The\nGreek 'mouse ion' had grown out of the shrine of the\nmuses, the Nine Muses being high ranking daughters\nof Seus and Mnemosyne-the goddess of memory.\nInitially the shrines were repositories of gifts, then\ntemples of art and finally a collection house of the\ningenuity of man. Their climax, as seen in Belenistic\ntimes, saw two rivals: Eumenes II and Pergamon and\nPtolemy Philadelphus at Alexandria, whose collections\nillustrated a fine composite structure. Here were\nlibraries, collections of paintings and sculpture residing\nwith colleges for scholars, including critics and poets.\nTheir 'mouse ian s' had become centres of knowledge\nand inspiration summed up by the Greek\n'encyclopedia'-a complete circle of learning. Roman\nmuseums never equalled their Greek counterparts in\nterms of quality but easily surpassed them by sheer\nquantity gathered during their plundering of\ncontinents. At first, museums were akin to private\nlibraries and as Seneca, a Roman philosopher and\ntutor to Nero, once commented, they had become as\nfashionable as a private bath. Roman civic pride\nshowed itself admirable and provided suitable cultural\nimpetus that caused many museums and libraries to\nbecome turned over to public use. The Egyptian ideals\nof Rameses II are eloquently expressed in an\ninscription over the doorway of his library at Thebes.\nThe legend reads: 'a place of healing for the soul.'\nIt is from these examples that the British Museum\ndraws its life blood. The libraries of learning, the\nmassive collection of civic memory and artefacts and\nthe divine feeling of satisfaction experienced by\ntoday's visitor or pupil. Despite grand, cavernous\nrooms in simple stone hues and the stillness of\nexhibits this place is warm and inviting. An\natmosphere able and willing to allow eager hearts and\nminds to imbibe the pleasures of fine arts and crafts\nfrom a massive slice of history.\nSnorting horses and warriors clash with titanic\nbeasts in intricate fr eases. Glorious statues and\nsculptures which once stood proud stand again, with\na little help, exhibiting their artists' grace and the\nmodels' courage and dynamism. Egyptian gods look\nupon you in animal-man amalgamation. And the\nmiddle-class life and finery of Trojans and Hadrian's Roman Britain is played out before you.\nIt is truly inspirational and leaves you on a high. The\nonly sad note is that despite this great effort many\nartefacts lie in grave-like state, rotting for lack of\nmoney and time for preservation. Don't miss out on\nthis invaluable experience: you may think that three\nor four years is a long time but it will soon be gone.\nStart now, today, this weekend.\nThe British Museum is open Monday to Saturday\n10.00am to 5.00pm and Sunday 2.30pm to 6.00pm. Admission is free and disabled visitors are well catered\nfor, as are the hungry and the thirsty ones in the\ncomfy cafe!\nIt is on Great Russel Street and the nearest tubes\nare Russel Square and Tottenham Court Road.\nTelephone 01-636 1555.\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "Groans at loans\nby Neil McCluskey\nImperial College Union has policy that it thinks loans\nare a bad idea. It is my duty to abide by that policy\nand formulate campaigns to try and stop the\nintroduction of loans. This job is made much easier\nby the fact that I am personally dead set against the\nproposals put in the White Paper.\nMy personal reasons for being against the loans are\non the basis that when the loans come in the standard\nof living for a student falls well below the minimum\nstandard that the Government believes itself (i.e. either somebody on the Youth Training Scheme (YTSI\nor an unemployed person). The figures opposite show\nthe drop in standard.\nEven this example is grossly understated. Rent in\nLondon is usually higher than \u00a350 and travel costs are\ncertainly higher. So ignoring the fact that the\nGovernment wishes students to pay for themselves,\nthe total funds available are not even adequate.\nMy job is to inform you how to go about stopping\nthe White Paper turning into legislation. At the time\nof reading the White Paper will be in the House of\nCommons going through what will probably be its final\ndiscussion period before being published as a Bill to\nbe introduced in the coming year. Once introduced as\na Bill (which could feasibly be Monday if the\nGovernment rushed it!!) it will receive its second\nreading and will go off to committee for amendment.\nIt is important that some action is taken immediately\nso that ideas are put forward for amendment. I believe\nthe only way to stop this scheme is to put reasoned\narguments forward to amend the Bill and thus delay\nit. If the Bill is delayed for a period of as little as two\nmonths the Government will find it virtually impossible\nto pass the Bill and implement the the necessary\ninfrastructure to enact the Bill. The Government is\nunlikely to reintroduce the Bill immediately prior to\nelection time!!\nAs you read this, a number of Union Council\nmembers will be attending the debate in the House\nof Commons and pulling out their local MPs to put\nLOANS-COMPARATIVE INCOME EXAMPLES\n1. Single person aged 18 on YTS scheme\nReceives \u00a329.50 per week allowance. Pays \u00a350 rent (\u00a344\nrent, \u00a35.25 rates \u00a30.75 water rates). Pays \u00a36 travel, \u00a33 of\nwhich is refunded by the employer.\nHousing benefit entitlement \u00a346.42\nNett rent to pay \u00a33.58\nAvailable income =\n\u00a329.50-\u00a33.00-\u00a33.58 = \u00a322.92\n\u00a317.04\n\u00a332.96\n\u00a363.57\nper week\n2. U.G. Student aged 18 receiving London grant\nReceives \u00a32650pa, pays \u00a350 rent and \u00a36.00 travel.\nHousing benefit entitlement\nNett rent to pay\nAvailable income for living expenses and travel\nN.B, \u00a3234.00pa is included in the grant for books\n\u00a3120.00pa is included in grant for travel\nAvailable income after deducting net t rent & travel \u00a324.61\n3. Unemployed single person aged 18\nReceives \u00a327.40 income support, pays \u00a350 rent. Actively\nseeking work thus spends \u00a36.00 on travel\nHousing benefit entitlement \u00a348.20\nNett rent to pay \u00a31.80\nAvailable income after deducting net rent & travel \u00a319.60\nIf this person did not spend anything on travel this figure\nwould be \u00a325.60\n4. U.G. student aged 25\nSame circumstances as in example 2 \u2022\nHousing benefit entitlement 21.16\nNett rent to pay \u00a328.84\nAvailable income after deducting for rent and travel \u00a330.99\n5. Unemployed person aged 25\nSame circumstances as example 3\nReceives higher rate of income support \u00a334.90\nHousing benefit entitlement \u00a348.20\nAvailable income after deducting net t rent & travel \u00a327.10\nWithout expenses for travel this becomes \u00a333.10\n6. Student aged 18 London grant and first year loan\nSame circumstances as in example 2\nLondon grant frozen at 1989/90 level \u00a32650pa Government loan \u00a3460pa Total income \u00a3311 Opa\nAfter deductions for books \u00a32876pa Weekly equivalent for 38 week year \u00a375.68\nHousing benefit entitlement n/a Available income after rent and travel \u00a319.68\nAll figures are per week unless otherwise stated\nforward their case. What you can do is the following:\n1. Find out the facts-see me or the other\nsabbaticals for this information.\n2. Formulate your own arguments and opinions and\nwrite to your local MP immediately-again we can\nhelp you in what to write and how to find out who\nyour MP is.\n3. Write to your parents or give us permission to\ndo so. If any student wishes us to send information\nto their parents (after all it is probably them who will\nend up paying) then simply drop an A4 envelope with\nyour parents' name and address into the Union Office\nand we will send off the information.\n4. Make sure that for every objection you have there\nis a viable alternative. The Government is\nimplementing these proposals because they wish to\nachieve certain objectives, i.e. increase access,\nreduce expenditure on education. You must come up\nwith viable alternatives, again see us for the ideas.\nWe can only help you to help yourselves. If all of\nthe above seems too much like hard work then I have\nabsolutely no sympathy with you. I am putting in a lot of work in coordinating this campaign it would be\nappreciated if for once IC students could make a similar effort. It will be you experiencing the effects\nof loans, especially if you are in your first year.\nEnts muscling in\nTonight sees the welcome return of The Muscle Shoal\nto the centre of the Imperial social scene, the Union S s Lounge.

    "content": "FeliX Letters\nI have received a number of letters on the subject of\nthe Life Sciences Division. Unfortunately, these were\nhanded in too late for inclusion in this week's issue.\nI shall print them all in next week's issue, whilst\nrefraining from comment now. FELIX welcomes\nletters. This is your Newspaper; if you wish to vent\nyour opinion in the form of a letter or opinion article,\nplease drop something in to the FELIX Office. The\ndeadline for letters is Tuesday lunchtime, 1.30pm. Loans again\nA lot of people are probably going to complain that\nI have biased this issue with an anti-loans stance. I fully admit to this with no shame whatsoever. After\nthe pathetic turnout at Tuesday's EGM, I felt that it\nwas important to try and raise people's awareness on\nthis issue. The end-line of the loans issue is that every\nstudent in London will be \u00a320 worse off per week,\nunless they are prepared to take out a hefty overdraft.\nAlready, students at Imperial have overdrafts hanging\naround their necks; if the situation gets much worse,\nstudents will not be able to study in London. If you\ndon't care about this, I have only one question to ask;\nwhy did you come here?\nIf you do care, or you want to know more, please\ngo to the Union Office and find out some details.\nContrary to popular, but misinformed, opinion, the\nUnion is not the people in that Office, it is YOU. If\nthere is no opposition to loans from IC Union, it will\nbe your fault this year.\nA sad point to note at this stage is the Rector's opinion on the matter.'He feels that grants 'wholly\npaid for by the State are no longer tenable.' I must\npresume from this that he also means that Imperial\nCollege is no longer tenable as a place of study.\nProfessor Ash represents us at the highest levels\nwithin the education system, and he is selling us out.\nThis calls for a brief resume of what happened last\nyear, I think.\nLast year, IC Union Hon Sec, Ian Morris, presented\na paper to the College's Governing Body, which\noutlined the financial failings of the loans scheme\nproposals. Governing Body decided to set up a committee to look into the paper further. Professor\nAsh was appointed as the person in charge of calling\nthis meeting. What a surprise that the paper was\nnever discussed then. How are we supposed to feel\nwhen the man at the top refuses to even help in the\nformulation of an opposition to loans? I 'll tell you how\nI feel; disgusted. At this rate, Imperial College will\ndisappear before Professor Ash has a chance to finish\nhis term in office. Oh well, I guess there will be some\nmention in the Queen's Honours list one day, after\nwe're all gone. Thanks Eric.\nSouthside\nI have begun to wonder who is in charge of what at\nImperial. I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that\nthe only thing that everybody is in charge of is\ncovering their own arse. Peter Hallworth changed his\nstory on the swapping of the Southside locks more\ntimes than I care to mention. He ended up by blaming\nthe Southside housekeeper and temporary staff\nemployed during the Summer. This is not good\nmanagement. A good manager takes the rough end\nof the stick and backs up the staff below him. Face\nit Peter, you were in charge of these locks as\nManaging Surveyor of Residences and there was an\nalmighty mix up and terrible breakdown in\ncommunication. Blaming other staff and then saying\nthat you were very busy during the Summer is not\ngood enough. The Summer holiday should be your\nslack period if you are actually looking after STUDENT\naccommodation.\nHappy Birthday\nHappy birthday to our music editor, Neil Lavitt for\nWednesday.

In initial retrospective studies, in which\nsmoking habits of known lung cancer patients were\nascertained and compared with control groups, it was\nshown that the proportion of patients who were nonsmokers was extremely small (about 1 %) while more\nthan half had been heavy smokers over a number of\nyears. Prospective studies, in which populations were\nfirst characterised in terms of tobacco usage and the\nappearance of lung cancer then followed for a number\nof years, were even more conclusive. The risk of\ndeveloping lung cancer was up to thirty times greater\nin smokers than non-smokers, and was proportional\nto the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration\nof the smoking habit. By giving up smoking, the risk\ncould be very much reduced. The mortality in different\nage groups at various smoking levels is shown in table\nA. The risks involved in pipe or cigar smoking were\nvery much less than from cigarettes and only about\ntwice that of non-smokers. Cigar and pipe smokers,\nhowever, run a considerably higher than average risk\nof cancer of the lip or oral cavity.\nOther aspects of the epidemiology of lung cancer\ncould also be correlated with cigarette smoking. Lung\ncancer has increased dramatically in the last fifty\nyears and this can be wholly correlated with increased\ncigarette consumption. In the UK the death rate for\nmales in the 65-75 age group rose from 36 per\n100,000 in 1935 to 650 per 100,000 in 1973. As\na result of the long latency in the development of lung\ncancer the mortality rates in any particular period\ncorrelate most closely with the 'per capita'\nconsumption of cigarettes twenty years previously.\nThis is particularly well illustrated by the upward trend\nof lung cancer in women which began in the 1960's and has continued at a faster rate of increase than in\nmales. In the UK it was unusual for women to smoke\nbefore about 1920, and the main increase in women\nsmokers began in the 1940s. After a lag of twenty\nyears, lung cancer began to rise rapidly in women.\nThe incidence of lung cancer varies around the\nworld, having its highest incidence in the UK where\nit carries a higher mortality than any other tumour.\nThis variation may be accounted for by the differences\nin the types of tobacco used in the manufacture of\ncigarettes in different countries.\nThe association between smoking and cancer is\nthus very strong and is most probably the result of\nthe carcinogenic substances in tobacco tar. However,\nwhilst about 10% of heavy smokers die of lung cancer\nothers survive to an advanced age without developing\nthe disease. Cigarette smoking may not, therefore, in\nitself be a sufficient cause of lung cancer in the\nabsence of some other predisposing influence in the\nindividual. A genetic influence is one possibility and\nthere is evidence for both familial incidence of lung\ncancer which is independent of cigarette smoking, as\nwell as an i her it ed tendency to be a smoker or\nnon-smoker.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "In the first of a hopefully-not-too-occasional series of articles on research\nbeing done here, at Imperial College, Professor Charles Rees of the\nDepartment of Chemistry describes his work on a subject that spans\norganic and inorganic chemistry. It could be described as chemistry with\nno loose ends\u2014the chemistry of rings of atoms...\nChemistry in circles\nOrganic chemistry, the chemistry of carbon\ncompounds is the chemistry of life. Its unique and\nnecessary feature for life is the limitless ability of\ncarbon IC) atoms to form themselves into long and\nbranched chains, rings and three dimensional\nnetworks. These carbon atom frameworks can then\ncombine with most of the other chemical elements,\nthough hydrogen (H), oxygen (0) and nitrogen (N) are\nthe most common, generating an almost infinite\nnumber of possible structures.\nAlthough all organic compounds came originally,\nfrom nature, many more have now been made in\nchemical laboratories and most of the 9 million\ncompounds described in the Chemical Abstracts\nDatabase are synthetic organic compounds. About\nhalf of these belong to one vast class called\n'heterocyclic'. These are rings of carbon atoms\ncontaining at least one other element, 0, N and\nsulphur (S) being the most common. There is a limitless number of such compounds: the rings can be\nof any size, from three membered upwards, and the\nnon-carbon 'he t ero' atoms can be chosen from most\nof the other elements.\nBut why have millions of these compounds been\nproduced? Why are new ones still being made, world-wide, at a rate of one every few minutes. There are\nseveral reasons: heterocyclic compounds are widely\ndistributed throughout nature and are essential for life;\nthey play a vital role in the metabolism of all living\ncells. The pyr imi dine and purine bases of DNA and\nRNA, some of the essential amino acids, many\nvitamins, co-enzymes and hormones, and chlorophyll\nand haemoglobin are all heterocyclic compounds.\nThey are extremely useful, and profitable. Many\nbiologically active substances are heterocyclic,\nincluding natural products such as penicillin and\nmorphine. Synthetic heterocyclic compounds range\nfrom anti cancer drugs to solvents. Of the 10 biggest\nselling pharmaceuticals, all are cyclic and 7 are\nheterocyclic. Half of Glaxo's recently announced \u00a31\nbillion profit came from just one heterocyclic\ncompound, the anti-ulcer agent Ranitidine.\nHeterocyclic compounds are important theoretically\nand their unlimited flexibility can produce compounds\nwith almost any desired physical, chemical or\nbiological property. We only need to be clever enough\nto design and construct the right sequence.\nTraditionally the design of heterocyclic compounds\nstarts with and appropriate all-carbon ring, like\nbenzene, and considers the effect of introducing\nheteroatoms into this, one at a time. This works\nsurprisingly well for the first few heteroatoms but then\nstarts to break down badly. The number of available,\nstable molecules rapidly drops when there is a large\nproportion of heteroatoms. So, in spite of the vast\nnumber of known heterocyclic compounds, there is\na big gap in our knowledge of stable, and hence useful\ncompounds. This is gap which we are trying to fill in\nCH3 CH\n^N_CH A X N07CH7. CH:\nCH7H H Ranitidine: an heterocyclic anti-ulcer drug worth \u00a31 million per day\nits manufacturers.\nthe Hofmann Lab in the Chemistry Department at\nImperial College.\nOur approach is the exact opposite of that described\nabove. We start with stable rings composed wholly\nof heteroatoms and study the effects of introducing\ncarbon atoms, one at a time. We hoped that if the\nstarting rings were stable enough we could modify\nthem in this way, producing organic compounds\nwhich would still be stable in spite of their unusual\nstructure. This simple idea has proved to be very\nsuccessful and, 8 Ph.D theses and 25 papers later,\nwe have established the main ground rules in this new\narea of chemistry which straddles organic and\ninorganic.\nWith this approach we could, in principle, start with\ncyclic structures from anywhere in the Periodic Table.\nWe actually started with compounds of sulphur and\nnitrogen, two of the most important heteroatoms.\nSeveral such compounds are known, with a wide\nvariety of ring sizes and shapes. Their (inorganic)\nchemistry has been well worked out and, fortunately,\nwe have an expert in this field, Dr Derek Woolins, in\nthe department. Many of these inorganic compounds\nhave de localised structures, structures in which the\nindividual electrons have freed themselves from the\natoms and are flowing around the rings. This promises\nwell for compound stability and for many practical\napplications such as dyestuff s and pigments and,\nparticularly, conductors. Indeed the ultimate\nde localised structure in this area is a linear polymer\nof alternating sulphur and nitrogen atoms,\npoly sulphur nitride ((SN)n),a highly conducting\nanisotropic 'metal' which becomes superconducting\nat sufficiently low temperatures. One of the aims of\nour work is to improve on the properties of this\npolymer by incorporating the atomic framework into\nthe much more stable heterocyclic rings that we have\ndiscovered whilst maintaining the totally de localised electron structure.\nThis is still for the future. What we have done so\nfar is to establish chemical methods for opening the\nsulphur-nitrogen rings, inserting a carbon atom or two\nand snapping the ring shut again. We have discovered\na range of fascinating 5 to 8 membered heterocyclic\nrings which are highly stable and beautifully coloured.\nThey are quite unlike anything observed in nature, or\nthe lab, before. Indeed one of the pleasures of being\na research student working on synthetic chemistry is\nthe opportunity to make entirely new materials and\nto be the first person to see and handle them - long\nbefore your supervisor!\nIt now remains to be seen if our compounds will be\nas practically useful as they are theoretically novel.\n/ /\n: N:N Polysulphur-nitride: a highly reactive conducting 'metal' made from non-metals, adding heterocyclic rings may make it more stable.\nPage 6\n\n"

Unfortunately,\nif you require a meaningful storyline to stir strong\nemotion in you, tough!\nPeck plays Ambrose Bierce; the legendary American\njournalist with the acid pen, who disappeared in\nMexico. Smits is a young revolutionary general who\nuses Fonda, a governess, as a ploy to free his home\ntown from rich landowners. This leads to an almost\ndramatic battle which the revolutionaries win,\nnaturally. From there on the film goes downhill, Smits\nseduces Fonda, and at the same time is unable to\nescape his past which prevents him from joining the\nrest of the revolutionaries in Mexico. This ultimately\ncauses his downfall and Peck's too, as he tries to help\nSmits leave the past.\nPeck acts well and plays a more philosophical and\nsedate Bierce, this is probably more to do with the fact\nthat the script is written in his favour and the rest of\nthe cast are not particularly special. Fonda's narration\nat the end is very annoying. The scene in which Smits\nshoots his own horse is probably the most dramatic\nin the whole film and after this event I didn't care what\nhappened to Smits.

It is laced with his constant\nthemes of death, decay and corruption. In this film it\nis the colour of the images that is all important. As\nthe action switches from one scene to another the\nlighting changes from blue to green to red to white-and the leading characters change costume\naccordingly.\nThe plot is simple, although up to Greenaway's usual slightly surreal standards. The Cook (Richard\nBohringer) runs a restaurant which is patronised, or\nterror is ed, by the Thief (Michael Gambon), a bullying\ngangster who is accompanied by his beautiful, long\nsuffering Wife (Helen Mirren). Sitting in the same\nrestaurant, watching the Thief's humiliation of all\naround him, is the book collector who becomes the\nWife's Lover (Alan Howard).\nTheir bizarre couplings take place in the gleaming\nwhite restaurant Ladies, the murky green-lit kitchen\npantry and even in the restaurant's cold store. The\nThief of course eventually discovers why his wife\nspends so much of each meal 'in the Ladies', but I will\nnot spoil the de nou ment of the film as other reviewers\n(Film 89) have done. Suffice to say, in a film obsessed\nwith food and sex, it is a timely and fitting revenge.\nThe film is a sensory bombardment. The platters of\nfood in the restaurant, the hellish atmosphere evoked\nby the red drapes and devil-like pre sc en ce of the Thief\ncontrast with the gleaming silence of the lavatories\nand the dangerous atmosphere of the blue-lit carpark.\nThere is extreme brutality, so much so that I wondered\nat times if I was watching a 'blood and guts' film\nrather than an 'art' film, but the violence is not\nmisplaced. Michael Gambon's performance is brilliant\nin evoking a monstrously vulgar personality and the\nother leading actors support him admirably. Behind it\nall is another obsessive, hypnotic, overwhelming\nscore.\nIt is hard to know whether to recommend this film.\nIt is not an easy evening's viewing: the violence is not\nbanal but highly disturbing and calculated. Precisely\nbecause of that, and the genius of its conception and\ndesign, this must be one of the best films of the year.\nLiz W.

    "content": "The Delator Column\nLucky dip justice\nby Paul Shanley\nThe Conservative Party Conference last week was\nalmost as dull as the Labour, SLD, and SDP ones in\nthe weeks before. From what I did see of it\u2014and\nluckily I missed Her speech-the only orator that\ndidn't threaten to place the listener in a sleep-inducing.\ntrance of Rip Van Winklesque magnitude was Douglas\nHurd.\nThe Tory Party as a whole, is a body of people I have\nnever held in very deep regard. As individuals, there\nare some that stick out - if only for Margaret to chop\ntheir necks off\u2014but by and large they mostly\nrepresent the True Blue ideal. This is an ideal that you\neither defend staunchly or attack to the death. The\none senior minister who has cut through all party\nbarriers recently has been Douglas Hurd, no more so\nthan in his speech to conference at Blackpool.\nUp until recently, the picture of the Home Secretary\nthat has sprung to mind has been that of Spitting\nImage's quivering jelly complete with ice cream cone\nhaircut. Last Wednesday's speech will have left that\nimpression far behind.\nHurd's conference speech was both confident and\ncompetent. In it he outlined plans for law and order\nwhich members of all peaceful political groups must\nsurely agree with. The minister left the electorate in\nno doubt that whatever else the government does, the\nlegal process will not be brushed to one side.\nBlackpool was duly impressed and rewarded Hurd\nwith a standing ovation-a rare privilege for a Home\nSecretary.\nBut does Hurd's address amount to mere rhetoric?\nIs government policy getting through to the judges?\nIf last week's batch of sentencing is anything to go\nby, it would appear not.\nAmongst the punishments handed out last week\nwas one of such astounding stupidity that it would\n. lead one to suspect that judges rely more on a lucky\ndip than on the sentencing book they have in front of\nthem. On Wednesday, a man who fired at an 18-month old baby from a tower block was found guilty\non two charges of causing actual bodily harm and one\nof possessing a prohibited firearm. The gunman had\nbeen released from custody on the morning of the\nshooting after a nine-month spell for mugging an old\nwoman. On being arrested, he said \"I did it for a laugh\". The man was freed by an Old Bailey judge.\nAn overhaul of the legal system is necessary if that\nis what it will take to ensure that serious offenders\nare not unleashed onto the community but are put\nwhere they belong-behind bars. Until that happens,\nuntil judges are educated, the words of the Home\nSecretary, no matter how commendable they may be,\nring hollow.\nManchester United?\nThe story so far: Martin meets Michael in a pub. \"Can\nI buy you a drink, Michael?\", says Martin. \"Can I buy\nyour football team, Martin?\", says Michael. \"Have\nyou got any money, Michael?\", says Martin. \"No,\nMartin\", says Michael. \"Okay, Michael, you talked\nme into it. It's yours for \u00a310m\", says Martin.\nThe saga of Manchester United football club came\nto a conclusion (hopefully) last week when Michael\nKnighton withdrew his bid to buy the club in return\nfor a non-executive directorship of the board. The\nwhole sorry affair has been an unfortunate one. What\nstarted out as a simple contract between two parties\nhas turned into a scandal that has tarred the good\nname of Manchester United.\nKnighton could have taken an easy option. It would\nhave been relatively easy to approach a merchant\nbank and say \"I 've got the rights to buy a business\nfor \u00a310m that's really worth closer to \u00a315m. Lend me\nthe money to close the deal and I 'll sell the business\nand pay you a hefty commission\". This he did not do.\nThat alone demonstrates either an incredible lack of\nnous on his part or a deep affiliation to the club.\nI think the latter is more likely. If the rumours are\nPage 14\nto be believed, Knighton approached numerous\nbusinessman including Owen Oyston, Eddie Shah and\nlan Maxwell (son of Bob), to help him out. This was\nafter his original financiers had pulled the plug on him.\nIt would appear that with this volume of dealing, he\nhad a general desire to retain the club after\npurchase-not sell it for a fast buck.\nThe most astounding feature of the whole affair,\nhowever, is that Knighton's credentials weren't checked before the deal was reached. It has been\nstrongly hinted by the quality media that his total\nwealth is less than \u00a310m, let alone having this sum\nas operating capital. Knighton isn't even registered\nwith Company House.\nMost Manchester United fans must now be\nregretting that Michael Knighton doesn't head the\nboardroom at Old Trafford. Football has far too many\nchairmen who run clubs for greed and their own self-interest. Of course, clubs should be profit-making, but\nthey should also be there to provide a service to the\nfans. Without their supporters, clubs would not exist.\nThat is a fact that far too many clubs choose to ignore.\nEau?\n\"There is nothing wrong with the quality of British tap\nwater. I drink it myself.\" - Environment Secretary,\nChris Patten last month. Seen at the Tory Party\nconference last week - countless bottles of Malvern\nSpring water lined up along the front table. This\nweek's quiz : Which minister in particular was seen\ndrinking it?\nApology\nIn last week's column, it was inadvertently stated that\nthe Union Administrator, Jen Hardy-Smith is 94.\nDelator now acknowledges that this statement is\ncompletely without foundation. Delator retracts the\nstatement unconditionally and accepts the fact that\nit was no more than a cheap jibe by a two-bit journalist\nseeking to get a quick laugh at someone else's' expense. Delator wishes to apologise to Mrs HardySmith for any inconvenience this may have caused\nher. Silly old bag.\n\n"

This cannot be said about Brian\nMay's guitar work however, which stays immaculate\nall the way through.\nThe camera work is generally good, but the most\nirritating thing in the video is the cutting together of\nthree concerts in quick succession through large\nportions of some songs, especially in Keep Yourself\nAlive, where it is hard to keep track of where you are.\nThis ruins all the performances.\nDon't let this criticism put you off from getting to\nsee it at some time though-if all the Queen you know\ndates from The Works then you need to see Queen\nin their early prime. For dedicated fans this is a worthy\naddition to your collection.\nFinally, see if you can spot Kevin McCann's hat\nbeing worn by Brian May, it's in there somewhere!\nBen Gladwyn.\nSeasons End\nAre Marillion more than just adept, yet faceless,\nbacking musicians for their erstwhile lead singer, Fish?\nIs this, their 'difficult' fifth album, the change in\ndirection that it is being claimed to be? ('Progressive\nrockers never die, they just change direction.') To\nquote a lyric from Misplaced Childhood, 'Does\nanybody care anymore?'.\nIt is immediately apparent that this is a 'new' sound\nas they pinch riffs from groups other than Genesis.\nKing of Sunset Town is the opening to Saf Out of Hell\nand The Space is Ozzy Osbourne's Diary of a Mad\nMan. Elsewhere, Clannad (Easter), Rush and pop-metal in general are evoked; but the general\nimpression reeks, uncannily of Foreigner, partly\nbecause of Steve Hogorth's vocals.\nThis is not to say that their latest album is all bad.\nThey still manage to change tempo at least twice in\nevery song and Fish has taken much of the depressing\nsubject matter with him. Steve Rothery's guitar is\nrefreshing, although it is developing a nasty metallic\ntaste at times, and Mark Kelly contributes lush\nkeyboards that support the song rather than\nswallowing it.\nHogarth's voice is not always foremost in the mix,\nand although he claims the Marillion fans have already\naccepted him it remains to be seen whether he can\nmatch the enormous stage presence of his Scottish\npredecessor.\nSeason's End is accomplished yet devoid of the\nemotion of their earlier work. It is their most MoR\npiece to date, but they could fore fe it older fans simply\nbecause it lacks fresh ideas and revisits over-familiar\nterritory.

And one of them had pink\ncowboy boots ('nuff said).\nThe shirts consisted of more rips than material,\npresumably to show off their (not so) manly bodies!!\nBy the time they got on stage, their lead singer was\nextremely pissed. Although whether that was the\nreason for his total lack of stage presence, and\ninability to sing is debatable. He pranced around the\nstage making a complete prat of himself, but never\nmind! (What can you expect for \u00a3100).\nFor musical ability, Gunfire Dance score 0, on\nentertainment....well the kids seemed to enjoy\nthemselves, probably because their drummer was\nquite good, but then it's difficult to play the drums\nout of tune.\nPersonally, I wouldn't see them again, but that's my\nopinion, and plenty of other people quite enjoyed\nthemselves! Maybe eight pints is a necessary\nprerequisite!!\nName withheld by request.\nLiza Minelli\nResults\nIt is trendy to like Liza now she's been subjected to\nthe Midas touch of the Pet Shop Boys. Having enjoyed\nchart success with the first single from Results, Losing\nMy Mind, in which she gushing ly gave us her all to\na Eurobeat backdrop, the far superior second single\nDon't Drop Bombs turned out to be one itself and\nseems to have disappeared without over troubling Gallup.\nThe LP as a whole is an uneasy mixture of\npredictable ballads full of schmaltz and potential disco\nsmashes. The Pet Shop Boys have supplied seven of\nthe ten songs, five of them new. Of the others Rent\nis given full Broadway treatment and an orchestra. It\nunfortunately suffers as a result, losing the\nidiosyncratic attraction of Neil Tennant's plaintive\nvocals. (WOT!) Another 'ex-PSB libris' song, Tonight\nis Forever works better in this format, although it will\nprobably now appear on an Elaine Page album.\nThe forgettable So Sorry I Said and a reworking of\nLove Pains are the low points; MOR fillers which show\nhow poor the album could have been without the help\nof Chris Lowe's skills at conjuring up dance grooves\nfrom a Fairlight. The most impressive of the dance\nnumbers must be the most unlikely. Tanita Tikaram's moody Twist in my Sobriety is transformed into a groovy stomper complete with scratching and\nrapping. Courtney Pine guests with some scintillating\nsoprano saxophone on If There Was Love and the final\ntrack / Can't Say Goodnight.\nDespite the high calibre of its contributors Results\nnever quite adds up to the sum of its parts. It will\nperhaps be remembered as a brave departure which\ndidn't quite succeed, but will probably make her a lot\nof money despite its failings.\n\n"

Students and a security guard were\nunable to enter when a fire alarm went off, and the\nfire brigade also had trouble when they were called.\nProfessor New, Warden of Falmouth Keogh Hall\nexplained that the locks were changed annually and\n'all students were issued with a key to fit old and new\nlocks' and that though it 'was potentially a clever\nsystem....it didn't work'.

    "content": "The Mighty Lemon Drops recently toured the UK to promote their latest album, Laughter.\nNeil Lavitt and Susan Appleby interviewed them before they went on stage at the Dominion\nTheatre last Saturday.\nThe Mighty Lemon Drops\nThe Mighty Lemon Drops formed in Wolverhampton\nin 1985. Known for a distinctly abrasive style of pop,\nthey were soon playing to capacity crowds up and\ndown the United Kingdom. This initial success\ncul mun a ted in the release of NME's compilation album\non which the track Happy Head caused no less than\nnine record companies to show interest. Since then\nhowever, despite popularity in the USA they have\nnever achieved their previous standing in the UK.\n'What the Mighty Lemon Drops have achieved in\nBritain is through our own efforts and the music\npress has never hyped us.'\nA very bitter comment it seems, surprisingly so from\nthe relaxed and extremely friendly figure of guitarist\nDave Newton. It was clear though that there was a lot of dislike at the way in which the press has reacted\nto their passage through the rock 'n' roll business,\nespecially in Britain.\nDave feels early comparisons with Echo and the\nBunnymen were press hyped and completely\nunjustified.\n'The similarities between us and the Bunnymen\nis based on the fact that we are a four piece guitar\nband which draws our inspiration from bands of\nthe late sixties, The Doors and The Velvet\nUnderground.'\nEven today the press has not improved, a two-page\ninterview with NME was edited down to half a page;\nthis they believe is due to NME's editor disliking them.\nOnly when the Lemon Drops went to the States did\nthey begin to lose favour with the UK music press.\nThe States however proved very successful for them\nwith initial sell out tours and hit singles culminating\nin a number one college album in the form of World\nWithout End. The band appear very modest about\ntheir success in America, attributing it mainly to hard\ntouring and early success which has allowed them\nprime radio play. They claim that Americans are less\nbothered about being hip and that the music is the\nmost important thing, whereas in the UK the reverse\nis true. Despite being extremely vague about their\naudiences, the New York Ritz was the best venue they\nhave ever played.\nIn the latter part of 1988 and early 1989 the Lemon\nDrops have toured the world, with three months in\nAmerica as well as touring Europe. The band has also\nbeen to Brazil where they managed to afford the most\nexpensive hotel in Rio de Janeiro, only playing to the\nmore a fluent of Brazilians. This is a great contrast to\ntheir British audiences.\nDave, as band guitarist, is also responsible for the\nwriting, especially on their last album titled Laughter.\nPrior to this he was helped by ex-bassist Tony until\nhe was asked to leave by the other members of the\nband. This was necessary, Dave feels, because he\nwas musically holding the band back and his creativity\nhad gone as far as it could go. He was replaced by\nthe latest bassist Marcus Williams who Dave is very\nhappy with.\nWhen asked about the lyrics Dave appeared very\nvague, even suggesting that they were about nothing\nat all, and when pushed only suggested that they were\n'non-directive, and not about my emotions and\nproblems, perhaps using other peoples problems\nas a source of inspiration'.\nLaughter was one of the first albums to be recorded\nin Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios in Bath, Avon.\nThe band feel that it is a definite progression, although\nit won't shock. The title was chosen in an attempt\nto expel the previous gloomy image of the band\ncreated to emphasise a new 'up' nature to\nthemselves.\nTheir creative confidence in Laughter may have had\nsomething to do with the Real World Studios, which\nKeith describes as being 'the perfect recording\nenvironment based upon an old mill with a glass\nfloor and a stream running underneath.' They were\none of the first bands to record in it and subsequently\ngot a reduced rate.\nThe Lemon Drops claim that they would never\nintentionally search out success, but in the same\nbreath claimed that they could handle it and would\nenjoy appearances on Top of the Pops and all the\nassociated media coverage. They make a living from\nrecord company advances and live on a day-to-day\nbasis, never looking too far forward. Despite this they\nare looking forward to touring Europe in December\nfollowed by the States again in January. No new\nmaterial has been written. Dave claims that he cannot\nwrite on tour as he is usually either asleep on drunk,\neach of which are difficult states in which to write.\nWe look forward to hearing from this band who\nappear to be making their last big push for UK\nsuccess. Hope you have stamina boys, you've a difficult hill to climb.\nN.E. M.L. Interview recorded in association with Susan Appleby\nof IC Radio. The interview will be broadcast at 7.00pm on October 30th. The Dominion Theatre is an extremely plush setting\nfor a gig by The Mighty Lemon Drops. What was more\nsurprising was that the average age of the following\nhad to be under 20, most of them probably students.\nThe gig started with The Family Cat, a five piece\nband consisting of three guitarists, a bassist and a drummer. The result was a sound that was very\nabrasive but very rhythmic and melodic. A lot of this\nhad to be attributed to some excellent lead guitar work\nand a very ingenious drummer who managed to keep\nmy feet tapping on practically every song. Their set\nseemed to progress very quickly and they were no\nsooner on stage than they had gone, no encore, a pity\nreally.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity the lights went\ndown, the audience rose, and behind the rising stalls\nand net curtain the Mighty Lemon Drops appeared.\nThe opening song At Midnight was a very\nuninteresting piece, followed by what was the best\nsong of the night; the 1986 Happy Head. This was\nthe only song which had my full attention.\nAs the concert prog esse d, my mind wondered more\nand more away from the music and more and more\nto what had happened at the Geology Freshers' dinner\nthe previous night.\nIn summary I have to say this was a very mediocre\nperformance; a previous press article described them\nas more lemon than mighty. This is very true. The\nlighting show was uninteresting and unnecessary and\nmore than anything Paul Marsh's vocals became\nirritating to the point where I had to leave three\nquarters of the way through.\nN.E. M.L. Starship\nI wasn't sure what to expect from the new Starship.\nThey have replaced two members of the band since\ntheir last LP, but the style of Love, Among the\nCannibals was always on my shortlist.\nThe overriding thing about this album is its overproduced and commercialised sound, with chorus and\nmulti tracking of the vocals very much evident. This\nled to much of it being indistinguishable from the rest,\nespecially on side one where no particular track stood\nout on its own.\nA track which shows promise is the title track which\nhas a more complex 'jungle' rhythm and syncopated\nbass line, breaking the monotony of side one but\nunfortunately doesn't seem to get anywhere.\nWe Dream in Colour is also a change because it isn'ta song about love, a rare occur en ce on this album.\nIt's pretty good turned up loud and could have the\nmakings of a single if it wasn't for the 'atmospheric'\nstart and over-repeated chorus which stretch it out\nto 6.27 mins.\nAfter that the album goes right downhill again with\na totally abysmal song Healing Waters and Blaze of\nLove which sounds like a mixture of all the American\npop songs I 've every heard.\nIt's taken Starship four years to get around to\nwriting a new album and, although their music is\ncertainly more substantial than on Knee Deep in the\nHoopla, it still rates as a run-of-the-mill record without\nthe inventiveness of Bon Jovi and therefore doomed\nto fail.\nBen Gladwyn.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Sez Wilkinson and Rhydian Hapgood present a discussion of the risks involved.\nCancer\u2014the hazards\nThere can be few people at College who have not met,\nor at some stage, been in contact with a cancer\nsufferer. There exists an abundance of novels\ncentering around the personal experiences of suffering\ncancer; testimonies which express the extreme\npsychological and emotional consequences of the\ndisease. This feature does not set out to evoke tears\nor to stimulate emotions. Rather it aims to inform the\nreader from a scientific viewpoint of factors\nassociated with the occur en ce of the disease.\nThe Statistics\nStatistical measurements of the frequency of cancer\nwithin and between populations are an important part\nof the study of the disease and have produced much\ninformation on its possible causes. The two measures\nof frequency most commonly employed are mortality\nand incidence. Mortality is the annual rate of death\nattributed to cancer, while incidence is the frequency\nof new cases arising in the population. As a cause of\ndeath, cancer is second only to heart disease in the\ndeveloped world and is showing an increasing\nincidence. To some extent this is due to the longevity\nEnvironmental\nfactors\nPersonal Habits\nOne of the most important examples of an\nenvironmental contribution to cancer is the\nassociation of lung cancer with cigarette smoking. In\nseveral large-scale studies, the mortality from lung\ncancer has shown to be over ten times greater in\nsmokers than non-smokers and to be proportional to\nthe number of cigarettes smoked and the number of\nyears over which smoking has been practised.\nSmoking also leads to increased mortality from\ncancers of the larynx, oral cavity, oesophagus and\nbladder. Similarly, air pollution may account for the\ngreater incidence of lung tumours among city dwellers\nthan in the country. Sexual experience influences the\nincidence of certain cancers. Cervical cancer is\nassociated with early sexual relations, an early age of\nmarriage and frequency of births, though with respect\nto the last point it seems that the act of intercourse\nrather than pregnancy is the important factor. Cervical\ncancer shows its lowest incidence among nuns,\nvirgins and Jewish women. Among the Jews, the\npractice of circumcision may be one factor responsible\nfor the low frequency of cervical cancer. Breast\ncancer shows the reverse correlation with sexual\nexperience in that it is less frequent among women\nwith a large number of children.\nDiet\nDifferences in the incidence of cancers of the\na ili ment ary tract (oesophagus, stomach, colon) may\nbe related to dietary components such as salt, smoked\nfood and alcohol. Some pronounced geographical\nvariations in frequencies of these tumours are likely\nto be the result of different dietary habits in different\nparts of the world. The association of stomach cancer\nwith low economic status is also likely to be due to\ndietary factors.\nPage 8\nenjoyed by the population in a period when fatal\ninfectious diseases have been largely eradicated and\nto more refined diagnostic procedures now in use.\nEven when these points are taken into account,\nhowever, some cancers, such as cancer of the lung,\nshow real increases. The rising frequency of cancer\nis presumably the result of our increased exposure to\ncarcinogenic (cancer-causing) agents.\nWithin a population the incidence of cancer varies\nwidely with age, sex, site of origin and various\nenvironmental factors. The latter, in particular,\nprovides valuable information on the basic factors that\ncontribute to the occur en ce of cancer. Further, there\nare sometimes wide variations when different\npopulations are compared and this geographical\ndependence of certain cancers is similarly indicative\nof important causative factors in the environment.\nAge\nFor most cancers, incidence in the population\nincreases with age. Some, however, show peculiarly\nhigh incidence in childhood, notably acute leukaemia\nand tumours of the central nervous system. For this\nScotland\nEngland & Wales\nFinland\nNetherlands\nAustria\nBelgium\nGermany, FR North. Ireland\nU.S.. Nonwhite\nU.S. White\nSouth Africa\nDenmark\nNew Zealand\nAustralia\nSwitzerland\nCanada\nIreland\nItaly\nFrance\ni=. a el Sweden\nNorway\nChile\nJapan\nPortugal\nOccupation\nThere are many examples of cancers which are\nhazards of particular occupations. The sites most\nfrequently affected are the skin, respiratory tract and\nbladder. That is either the surface with which the\ncancer-inducing agent first makes contact or that\nexposed to its active metabolites in urine. Among the\nearly examples of occupational cancers were the\nobservation of cancer in the scrotum of chimney\nsweep boys and shale-oil cancer in workers in mineral\noil distilleries. Bladder cancer was a hazard of the early\nani line and a zo dye industries and is caused by\naromatic amines and related substances.\nOccupational cancers can be caused by irradiation\nas well as by chemical carcinogens, illustrative\nreason, the overall incidence of cancer is higher in the\nfirst five years of life than in the next two five-year\nperiods.\nSex\nIn childhood and over 60 years of age, males are more\naffected than females, between 30 and 60 years the\noverall incidence is generally higher in fa males, because of the risk of cervical and breast cancer\nduring.this period. However, mortality is higher in\nmales in most age groups, because of their higher\nfrequency of cancer of low cur ability( lung, stomach);\nthe common cancers of women (breast, cervix) are\nmore readily cured. The frequency of some\nmalignancies differ markedly in the two sexes. Thus\ncancer of the lung and oesophagus are considerably\nmore frequent in males. For lung cancer the ratio of\nmales to females affected can be as high as 10:1.\nStomach cancer and leukaemia are also more common\nin men, though rather less strikingly so. On the other\nhand, cancer of the breast, reproductive organs and\nthyroids are more often found in women.

Recent measurements show that there has\nrecently been significant loss of snow and ice,\naccording to a report released by the Natural\nEnvironment Research Council. Mean summer\ntemperatures at the base have increased by 1 degree\nsince 1982.\nComputer models predict that the poles will be the\nfirst to suffer from global warming. Despite this,\nexperts warn against blaming all the rise on the\ngreenhouse effect. The Earth goes through a natural\ncycle of warming and cooling and it is believed that\nthe temperature of the planet is now reaching a peak.\nThere is still concern that the presence of greenhouse\ngases in the atmosphere may delay any eventual\ndownturn.\n\u2022 Despite protests from environmental groups, the\nWorld Bank has agreed to help fund the gigantic Indian\nNarmada Sagar-Sardar Sarovar dam project. The\nscheme will block several major rivers and includes\nplans for 30 major dams to irrigate 2 million hectares\nof land and provide 2500 MW of electrical power. At\nthe moment, the Bank is providing only 10% of the\ntotal finance and, pressure groups claim, as other\nsources of funding are few and far between the\nproject could run out of money before it is completed,\npossibly within 2 or 3 years.\n\u2022 Faith healers and their ilk often preach that health\nis a state of mind and that, for wont of a better term,\npositive thinking can cure diseases. Now researchers\nare hoping to put this theory on a firmer footing. The\nEuropean Science Foundation has provided $91,000\nto set up a network of researchers studying\n'neuro immuno modulation', the connection between\nthe immune system and the central nervous system,\nto see if one can affect the other.\n\u2022 The Earth's crust is at least 4 billion years old\naccording to Samuel Bowring of Washington\nUniversity, St. Louis. He, and colleagues from the\nAustralian National University in Canberra, have dated\nsamples of surface rock using a machine called\nSHRIMP, the Sensitive, High-Resolution, Ion\nMicroprobe, and found them to be 3.96 billion years\nold. There is evidence of still older rocks yet to be\nfound and Bowring believes that the planet's crust\ncould be up to 4.3 billion years old. The accepted age\nof the Earth itself is 'only' 4.5 billion years.\n\u2022 The Natural History Museum may have some\ninteresting plans for the future. In true Thatcherite\nstyle they have called in the ad-men and the design\nconsultants, gained a new logo and even put some\nmoney, well \u00a35 million, on one side for some new\nexhibitions. The museum is looking for inspiration\nfrom America: staff have been sent on study trips to\none of the US's greatest cultural centres, Disneyland.\n'Dearie me', said Mrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks as she\nreached for the sherry bottle, 'There are so many staff\nin the Citizens' Office these days that I hardly know\nwho to boss about first. Thank goodness I 've still got\nSidney Spanker around to give me a hand.'\nSidney Spanker had been Head Citizen two years\nago but he still liked to rush about Cheapskate telling\neverybody how important he was. Most of all he liked\nto tell Jackie Skirt, the Citizen in Charge of\nWellfeeling, what to do, because he thought she was\nvery pretty.\nUnfortunately, Spanker was nowhere to be seen.\n'He's probably playing with Wendy and GMT,' sighed\nJolly Hockey-Sticks. She walked gloomily around the\noffice, on her way treading on some citizens who\nwere waiting to use the smudging machine.\nIn one corner of the room Dai Rocking, the Deputy\nHead Citizen, was installing flashing lights and a record deck. 'Do you know where Sidney is, Dai?'\nasked Jolly Hockey-Sticks. 'No,' he shouted above\nthe disco beat, 'But Fiona Knickerless and Neil Smug\nhave gone to a very important meeting with Derek\nDash.\nMrs Jolly Hockey-Sticks was very annoyed about\nthis because they hadn't asked her if they could go\nfirst. 'Perhaps it's time I left Cheapskate,' she mused\nsadly. 'On the other hand, I could have another glass\nof sherry...'\nMeanwhile, in the Baron's Office, Neil Smug, the Head\nCitizen, was shouting at Derek Dash. 'Listen Derek,\nit's not fair of you to charge the citizens so much\nmoney for the Comic Shop. You know very well that\nhalf of the comics are useless-they were out of date\nwhen you were a citizen!' he exclaimed.\n'Oh dear,' said Derek. He had hoped that the\ncitizens wouldn't notice because he wanted the\nmoney so that he could have his go-karting rink\nre-surfaced.\n'And what's more,' chipped in Benj Trainers, the\nCitizen in Charge of Games, 'All our playing fields at\nGravlington have been ploughed up and now even\nSherpa Club can't climb over the bumps.'\n'Oh dear,' said Derek. Then he had a bright idea.\n'Perhaps you could have an H2 S04 House Party there\nand all the citizens' dancing would trample it flat. You\ncould even charge an entrance fee and give the\nproceeds to help the Chinese citizens.'\nSmug and Trainers glowered at him. 'Oh dear,'\nthought Derek. 'I wish Mad Dash were here. She's terribly good at getting people enthusiastic about\nthings.'\nJohn Secretary took his ear away from the keyhole\nand tiptoed down the corridor. He was giggling so\nmuch he'd had to stuff a 'Souvenir of Cheapskate'\nhandkerchief into his mouth.\nIt was Secretary's job to be crafty but he'd become\nrather fond of the citizens. Sometimes this made him\nfeel guilty about trying to trick them. More\nimportantly, though, he was glad to see Derek being\nmade to look silly.'\n'He's always bossed me around and pretended that\nhe ran Cheapskate, when I'm the one who does all\nthe important work,' thought Secretary. 'Now that I'm retiring to Martinique, I could get my own back once\nand for all. Perhaps I could even help the citizens...'\n9 Will Jolly Hockey-Sticks leave any sherry for\nSidney Spanker?\n\u2022Does John Secretary have something up his\nsleeve?\n01s it just his arm?\n*AII may be revealed in the next instalment of The\nBaron of Cheapskate.\nPage 7\n\n"
