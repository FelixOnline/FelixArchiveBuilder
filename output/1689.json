The game uti-lises the superior cognitive\nability of the human brain\nin \u2018pattern matching\u2019 and\n\u2018spatial reasoning\u2019, then\nuses machines to identify\nthe correct three-dimen-sional structures of\nproteins. In fact, this game\nwas exclusively designed\nfor this purpose by the\nUniversity of Washington\n(UWash). Before FoldIt,\nthe scientists at UWash\nwere using general public\ncomputer powers to solve\nprotein folding by complex algorithms. However,\nthey realised that humans\nhave an ingenious imagi-nation, which \u2013 if properly\nused \u2013 can identify folded\nstructures of proteins\nmuch better than com-puters. They were right!\nFoldIt was first launched\nin 2008, and in 2010 a\nNature paper showed that\nthe results provided by\nFoldIt players were far superior to computer-based\nresults.\nSo, what is the\nproblem with protein\nfolding? Proteins in our\ncells are microscopic\nmachines, responsible\nfor almost all our basic\nfunctions ranging from\ndigestion to respiration,\nexcretion to movement.\nBeing machine-like,\ntheir three-dimensional\nstructure is very important\nfor the functions they\nperform. When unfolded\ninto two dimensions they\nare merely a chain, strung\ntogether by amino acids\nin different sequences.\nKnowing this sequence\nand its biochemistry is\nsimple, but it is very difficult to identify the final\nthree-dimensional structure which proteins take\ninside cells. There is no\ncommon way to predict\nthe shape all protein struc-tures. An unfolded protein\n(a linear chain) has a large\nnumber of degrees of\nfreedom, and applying a\nmechanism to sort through\nall possible shapes will\ntake time more than the\nage of universe \u2013 even for\na single protein.\nIn FoldIt, the protein\nstructures to be solved\nare provided as randomly\nfolded structures. Using\nthe tools provided in the\ngame, the players fold\nthe structures into the\nmost stable conformation\npossible. Based on their\nstability, the solutions are\nscored, and the highest\nscoring solutions are\nanalysed by scientists to\ncheck their validity.\nThis strategy of\noutsourcing part of a\nchallenging research\nproblem to the public is\ncalled \u2018citizen science\u2019;\nit encourages direct participation of the public\nwith mainstream science,\nand educates them about\nthe important topics in\nscience. The idea is not\nnew: before the arrival\nof mainstream universi-ty-driven science, it was\ndone by citizens motivated by reason and desire\nto understand nature.\nBoth Charles Darwin and\nGalileo count as citizen\nscientists, and fields like\nbiology and astronomy\nhave progressed largely\nby the contribution of\namateur scientists.\nIn the 21st\ncentury, the\nmodel of citizen science\nhas changed. Now a\nwell-defined problem with\nloose constraints is passed\nonto citizens to solve.\nThese usually belong\nto the category where\nlarge data collection and\nsorting is required, and\ncomputational methods\nare not enough to\nmanage the scale of the\nproblem. In FoldIt, the\nnumerous folding states\nof proteins are identified\nusing puzzle-solving\ncapabilities of individuals which can bypass\ncomputational efforts\ndesired by algorithms.\nOther popular examples\ninclude EteRNA, which\ndeals with the folding of\nRNA structures, and is\nvery similar to FoldIt.\nAnother, ClickWorkers is\nrun by NASA to classify\nimages of Martian craters\n(a task which done by\nsolitary graduate students\nwould require months\nof effort), and Quantum\nMoves which simulate the\nmovement of atoms in the\nlattice. There is a larger\nlist of such citizen science\ngames online\nFoldIt can be downloaded on your local\ncomputer and runs all\nthree popular operating\nsystems: Windows,\nMacOs, and Linux. The\ngame provides a few introduction puzzles which\nteaches players how to\nplay it, but beyond that\nthe player can choose\nfrom science puzzles\nthat are running. These\npuzzles do not last\nforever, though they may\nrun for months until they\nare considered \u2018solved\u2019.\nOften, these puzzles are\neither unsolved structures\nof known proteins, or\nprediction of structures\nfor synthetically designed\nproteins. Players can\ncollaborate with each\nother by chats, organizing\ngroups and sharing puzzle\nsolutions. Additionally,\nnovel strategies discovered from players can be\napplied to develop better\nalgorithms to automate\nthe process. This, in\nturn, will help in making\nthe predicting structure\nfor artificially designed\nproteins simple, such that\ndesigned proteins can\nbe effectively made for\npractical purposes.\nSince its inception,\nFoldIt has been a\npowerful tool for advancing the number of proteins\nwith folded structure.\nTo its merit, it has some\nconsiderable accomplish-ments: in 2011, the FoldIt\ncommunity deciphered\nthe previously unknown\nstructure of Mason-Pfizer\nmonkey virus (M-PMV)\nwhich is responsible\nfor HIV infections. The\nprotein structure was\nsolved in ten days of\nthe puzzle going live,\nwhereas it had previously\nremained unsolved for\n15 years when attempted using conventional\nscientific approaches. In\nJanuary 2012, the FoldIt\ncommunity predicted the\nstructure of a synthetically designed protein,\nwhich was later improved\nby players themselves\nto improve efficiency\n18-fold. Last year, the\nMars Inc. and UC Davis\nhad released a series of\npuzzles to decipher the\nstructure of aflatoxin,\na group of carcinogens\nwhich are known to\ncontaminate food crops\naround the world. The\nfinal goal is to design\nan enzyme which can\ndegrade these aflatoxins\nbased upon the structural\nprediction of aflatoxins.\nPerhaps, if you are too\nbusy to find time to save\nthe world alone, you can\ngive FoldIt a try\nThe user interface of FoldIt // FoldIt\nConnect with Conservation \u2013 LEGO goes green\nThe toy company is pivoting to eco-friendly manufacturing, as the dangers of plastic waste become clear.\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nI\nt may be a surprise\n\u2013 for those who remember treading on\nrogue LEGO pieces\nin the dark \u2013 to hear the\ncompany is going green\nby producing plant-based\nplastics! Known as LEGO\nBotanical Elements, they\nwill start to enter playsets\nlater on this year, with the\nfirst pieces to be replaced\nincluding trees, bushes,\nand leaves. The plastic\nitself is sourced from\nsugar cane \u2013 while it may\nstill have some ethical\nand ecological issues, it\nis far more responsible\ncompared to crude oil.\nThanks to the powers\nof modern science, the\nplant-based plastic pieces\nare technically identical\nto those produced using\nconventional plastic\nproducing methods.\nLet us take a few\nmoments to appreciate\nwhat this change means.\nDue to the time it takes\nfor plastics to break down,\nthey are often seen in the\nenvironment long after\n\u201cMicroplastics\ncan enter our\nfood chain\nthrough\nplankton and\nfish\u201d\nbeing dumped by people.\nGlobally, very little\nplastic is recycled due to\nthe material\u2019s properties\n\u2013 with its durability and\ntemperature resistance,\nplastic is notoriously\nhard to recycle, and it\nso often breaks down in\nthe environment where\nit is dropped. This is, of\ncourse, unless it enters the\nocean via a river, or by\ndirect action of humans.\nHere the plastics break\ndown under UV light and\ntransform into microplas-tics. These microplastics\nare then consumed by\nplankton which in turn\nare consumed by fish that\ncan be caught and eaten\nby humans. This means\nplastic and its toxins are\nabletoenterourfoodchain\nand therefore potentially\npoison us. By working to\nthe World Wide Fund for\nNature (WWF) to support\nand build the demand\nfor sustainably-sourced\nplastic. As part of this,\nLego joined the Bioplastic\nFeedstock Alliance (BFA)\nto aid in securing fully\nsustainable sourcing of\nraw material for the bio-plastics industry. LEGO\nis not the first company\nto make such a move in\norder to help appeal to\nconsumers who are trying\nto reduce their impact on\nthe planet. When LEGO\nfirst hit the market in 1949,\nthe dangers of plastic\nentering ecosystems and\nclimate change would not\nbe discussed or pondered\nfor decades to come. Both\ncompanies and consumers\nare becoming more environmentally conscious,\nwhich is consequently\nhelping to drive such\na change in one of the\nworld\u2019s largest toy brands.\nLego goes green (but red blocks still available) // CC\nremove the amount of oil-based plastics entering the\nfood chain, we can help to\nprevent such occurrence.\nTo make this step\nforward, the LEGO\nGroup partnered with\nPHOENIX\nFrom the Ashes\nPhoenix, Imperial\u2019s Art Magazine presents \u201cFrom the\nAshes\u201d, a six-week long exhibition which embodies the\ncycle of art.\nJoin us at the opening night, Wednesday 21st\nMarch, at\nImperial\u2019s Blyth Gallery, to mark the start of this aesthetic\njourney.\n\n"

It has put\nforward six objectives,\nincluding creating added\nvalue for the College,\nincrease activity levels across all College\nbodies, and improve\nefficiency.\nA price review of all\nsport facilities, a restruc-turation of the student\nsport governing body, and\nthe introduction of a new\nactivity tracking app have\nbeen set to take place in\nthe first six months. The\nstrategy is set to extend\nover a period of four\nyears.\nA single sport committee is set to be put in place.\nNotably, the committee\nwill seek to homogenize\nrepresentation of sports\nclubs: in an effort to lower\ncosts, as well as reviewing\nthe prices, the partnership\nwill tender the Ethos gym\nand will seek out a single\nsportswear supplier for\nall sports clubs. Transport\nwill be restructured, with\ncoaches made available\nfor all performance clubs\nin the second year. A code\nof conduct will be put in\nplace for all sports clubs\nand their members, while\na charter outlining the expectations for sports and\nphysical activities will be\ncreated.\nThe partnership wishes\nto play a significant\npart in the college wide\nimplementation of the\n\u2018five ways of wellbeing\u2019\nprogramme. There is also\na wish to increase the\ncollege\u2019s standing in the\nBritish University and\nCollege Sport (BUCS)\nranking: the goal is to\nreach at least 15th\nplace\nby the end of the strategy.\nImperial\u2019s current ranking\nis 17th\n, behind Stirling and\nManchester at 16th\nand\n15th\nplace respectively.\nWill Hollyer, the Head\nof Sports at Imperial said:\n\"This strategy, and the\nfundamental changes it\nbrings to sport and physical activity at the College,\nhas the potential to make\na sustainable and positive\nimpact on the lifestyles,\nexperience and wellbeing\nof our people for the\nbetter.\"\nThe new strategy\ncomes after talks of a\nshake-up of sports at\nImperial last year by the\nUnion, amidst criticism\nof Sport Imperial for its\npoor communication and\nservices. The then-Dep-uty President (Clubs and\nSocieties) James Cox\nsaid: \u201cThis aims to solve\nthe root cause of a large\nproportion of our issues\nsurrounding sport at\nImperial, namely communication and transparency\nover decisions and the\ncomplexity of processes\u201d.\nworld-class standard that\nwe expect.\n\u201cThe new subject-level\nTEF will give students\nmore information than\never before...This will\nhelp applicants make\nbetter choices, and ensure\nthat more students get\nthe value for money they\ndeserve from higher education,\u201d he added.\nIn addition to the new\nTEF ratings, Gyimah is\nlaunching an open data\ncompetition to develop\napps designed to help\nprospective students\nmake their decision. Technology companies and\ncoders will have access\nto the government\u2019s\nLongitudinal Education\nOutcomes dataset, which\ncontains information such\nas employment and salary\nup to ten years after grad-uating.

The\nCollege\u2019s performance\nin individual subject\nleague tables however has\nbeen more questionable,\nwith Physics at Imperial\nfalling to 30th\nplace in The\nGuardian\u2019s 2018 league\ntables. College analysis\nat the time claimed this\nlow ranking was partly\nbecause The Guardian\ndoes not include research\nimpact in its analysis.\nThe subject-level TEF\nwill deliver its objective\nof \u201crevealing which universities are coasting or\nrelying on their research\nreputation\u201d by analysing\nstudent feedback, dropout rates, and graduate\noutcomes. These metrics\nhave previously attracted\ncriticism (Felix 1676).\nThe next TEF ratings\nare due to be published\nthis summer.\nWhen students were\nasked for their opinions\non the TEF, one of the\nmajor issues was that a\ngold university might\noffer bronze courses\nand vice versa. Rolling\nout the TEF to subject\nlevel will help to allay\nthese concerns but does\nnothing to tackle fears\nthat prospective student\nwill be put off applying\nto certain courses because\nof their ratings. Research\nindicates that this will\naffect BAME applicants\nthe most.\nThe subject-level TEF\nmay also be a way for the\ngovernment to get tuition\nfee changes in through\nthe back door. Under\nthe original proposals,\nuniversities with a higher\nTEF rating would be\nallowed to raise tuition\nfees in line with inflation.\nFollowing last year\u2019s\ngeneral election however\nTheresa May announced\nthat fees would be capped\nat \u00a39,250 until 2019.\nLast month education\nsecretary Damian Hinds\nsaid there should be\ngreater variation in tuition\nfees, with the cost of individual degrees linked to\ntheir value \u201cto our society\nas a whole\u201d.

You may have\nseen some of our beautiful\nposters around campus,\ndesigned by our incredibly Arts Editor Indira.\nThere were a number of\nreasons I wanted to run\nsuch a survey: firstly this\nyear will have marked\nthree years since the\n\u2018Misogyny at Varsity\u2019 in-cident, where the Imperial\nWomen\u2019s Rugby team\nwere appallingly treated,\nin a display of sexism that\nshowed how little many\nin society value women\u2019s\nsports teams.\nThat year was the first\nyear I was involved with\nFelix, and I can remember\nwhat the mood was in\nthe office and on campus\nwhen the story broke: one\nof anger and frustration.\nSince then we\u2019ve had\nImperial\u2019s Institutional\nCulture Review, which\nfoundproblemsoncampus\nwith competitiveness and\na lack of support. In both\ninstances, the College\nheld up their hand, and\npromised to change. One\nof the reasons to do this\nsurvey was to see whether\nthat change has been\ndelivered.\nThe second main\nreason to do the survey\nstemmed from speaking to\nfriends and acquaintances\nabout their experience\nat Imperial. I realised\nI couldn\u2019t think of any\nwoman I was friends with\nat Imperial who wasn\u2019t\nable to recount some kind\nof anecdote where she\nwas made to feel small,\nor unworthy, or uncom-fortable, on account of\ntheir gender. Not one.\nEveryone had an example,\nwhether it was being told\nthey should wash up the\nbeakers in their chemistry\nlab because they were a\nwoman, or being catcalled\nby random men at sports\nnight. This survey, was\nin part, a chance to give\npeople a voice.\nSimone Weil once\nwrote \u201cthe love of our\nneighbour in all its\nfullness simply means\nbeing able to say \u2018What\nare you going through?\u2019\u201d\nI like to think Felix exists\nto give a voice to the\nstudents here at Imperial,\nand the chance to speak\ntheir truth, to say what\ntheir experience has been\nlike. By all accounts, the\nresults of the survey show\nthis experience is not a\nhappy one for many.\nIs it a truly accurate\naccount of life at\nImperial? No. The survey\nwas self-selecting, and\n\u2013 as you might imagine\n\u2013 those who were most\nunhappy were more likely\nto contribute. The reality\nis probably not quite\nas bleak as the survey\nmakes it seem, but even\nif only a small number of\nstudents are having these\nexperience, it\u2019s still far\ntoo many.\nThe College and the\nUnion are both trying to\nmake things better; the\nCollege, in particular,\nhave been making real\nefforts to get more women\ninto academia, and when\nI sat down with Stephen\nCurry \u2013 Assistant Provost\n(Equality, Diversity, and\nInclusion) \u2013 he outlined\nsome of the things the\nCollege have put in place\nto address the issues.\nWhile these will lead to\nchanges on campus, the\nsurvey shows we have a\nlong way to go.

As\na boy who grew up in\nMalaysia, I had the luxury\nof enjoying all of these as\nwell as experiencing them\non my first ever backpacking trip.\nConveniently, the other\nSEA countries are located\nwithin three hours of flight\ntime from my homeland,\nand I\u2019d been particularly\nmotivated to visit Vietnam\nand Cambodia since I was\nvery young (I mean after\nwatching the famous\nCasey Neistat\u2019s travel\nvideos on YouTube). This\narticle will be helpful for\nfirst-time backpackers\nand/or those who plan\nto visit South East Asia.\nIt covers points like\ntravelling essentials,\nspecial tips, and the local\nculture of different South\nEast Asian countries\nwhich include Vietnam,\nCambodia, and Malaysia!\nTravelling essentials\nThe right mindset when\npreparing for a backpacking trip should always be:\n\u201cPack only the essentials\nfor survival, and pack\nlight\u201d. A backpack size of\n30-40L is ideal to fit all of\nyour travelling essentials.\nPersonally, I went for\nthe cheap Highlanders\nStarav 45L rucksack sold\nby Argos. I needed that\nmuch space because of the\ncamera gear I tend to carry\naround, which took up\nhalf the backpack. Hence,\nyou can imagine how little\nspace that was for the\n\u2018essentials\u2019. Medicines\nand travel insurance are\nvital, so do some research\nto understand the risks in\nthe country you\u2019re travelling to. Painkillers and\nmedicines for common\nsickness, like colds and\nfevers, are a must. Other\nthan that, well-known\ntravel insurance is offered\nby World Nomads which\ncovers up to 140 countries\nand has a good policy that\nfits most backpackers\u2019\nneeds.\nAlso, as a backpacker,\ntry to plan ahead for a\nwide range of activities\nyou\u2019ll be doing, which\nincludes selection of\nproper clothes and shoes.\nFor clothes, pack very\nlittle of each type but bring\na wide range \u2013 sports,\ncity-touring, swimming,\nand wedding, as you never\nknow. Besides that, a good\npair of walking boots or\ntrainers is always a backpacker\u2019s favourite. Also,\nbring a camera if you\u2019re\nan avid photographer\nlike me, but phone-pho-tography is good enough\nfor most. Lastly, don\u2019t\nforget to borrow a good\nthick English book from\nImperial library, just to let\neveryone else know that\nyou\u2019re smart.\nWhat\u2019s it like in SEA\nWhen compared to the\nUK, SEA is very humid\nand hot. On average, the\ntemperature there ranges\nfrom 25 to 32o\nC, with 80%\nhumidity. This makes\nperspiration a problem\nfor those who have never\nvisited before. Showering 2-3 times a day is\nnormal practice, hence be\nprepared to change your\nclothes very often. While\nI was backpacking, hand\nwashing my clothes was\nmy daily task. With a little\nbit of soap, some water,\nand a basin, you\u2019re good\nto go, and then you just\nneed to leave it outdoors.\nDo not worry \u2013 there will\nbe plenty of sunshine!\nAgain, with the heat and\nhumidity, slippers are\nvery commonly worn for\noutdoor walking so get\nyour hands on a pair if\nyou have a chance!\nFood here is very different from typical European\ncuisine. You might not\nlike it initially. However,\ndefinitely keep on trying\nas I promise that you\u2019ll\nfall in love with it. In this\nregion, the best food is\nfound on the streets, since\nvery rarely is the traditional cuisine done right in a\nfancy restaurant. To find\nthe best meal spots, ask\nthe locals, look for signs\nif the restaurant is full,\nor look up food bloggers\nonline as they know best.\nBest mindset\nOne crucial mistake\nmost people make is\nover-romanticising a\nbackpacking journey.\nBy and large, we travel\nto escape the norm and\nto relax our minds and\nbodies before heading\nback to the \u2018reality\u2019;\nyet, backpacking is even\nmore physically tiring\nthan our regular lifestyle.\nIn addition, backpackers\noften have to make\ncompromises during the\njourney as money supply\nis low. People are willing\nto go to different extents\nwhen it comes to saving\nmoney in general, but to\nsave money while you\u2019re\ntravelling is yet another\nstory. So in most cases,\nbackpacking is quite\nFelix\u2019s Guide to backpacking in South East Asia\nSouth East Asia is a popular destination between backpackers but long-term backpacking trips require a great\ndeal of knowledge and preparation. Luckily, travel writer YanKai Kee has shared some backpacking 101 and his\nfirst-hand experience of touring the a rea.\nYanKai Kee\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\n\u201cOne crucial\nmistake\nmost people\nmake is over-romanticising\na backpacking\njourney\u201d\nStreet food of Hanoi, Vietnam // YanKai Kee Hiking group in Sapa, Vietnam // YanKai Kee\ntough.\nThe reason why I think\neveryone should have\nthis mindset before going\non an epic backpacking\njourney is so they can\nprepare their minds for\nthe worst. To use a clich\u00e9:\nyou are going to enjoy\nsomething even more if\nyou set your expectations\nlow. Moments of leaving\na city and realising you\nleft your phone behind,\nhaving to force yourself\nto wash clothes despite\nthe tiring day, or having\nbad weather for consecutive days can dilute your\nbackpacking experience.\nBut once you\u2019ve accepted\nthere\u2019s also the \u2018dull and\nboring\u2019 part within the\ntrip and prepared your\nmind for such hardships,\nI guarantee you\u2019ll have a\nmemorable trip.\nHowever, having said\nthat,howcanInotmention\nthose beautiful moments\nyou\u2019re most likely\ngoing to enjoy during a\nbackpacking journey?\nBackpacking is for the\nbeautiful panoramic scen-eries that most people are\ntoo tired to hike to; it is for\nthe story-telling sessions\nyou get when you meet\nfellow backpackers; it is\nfor those nights where you\nfall asleep listening to the\nwaves of the ocean, and so\non. It\u2019s just like life, isn\u2019t\nit? Having a cocktail of\nnew experiences, adrenaline rushes, fun and tiring\nmoments.\nFinally, one of the\nmost important mindsets\nyou need to have is\nacknowledging yourself\nas an outsider. You\u2019re\ngiven a chance to explore\nbeautiful countries, hence\nrespect the locals and their\nculture. For example, in\nMalaysia, it\u2019s prohibited\nfor a man to shake a\nMalay woman\u2019s hand.\nPractical tips\nNext up is something\npractical that one must\ntake into account \u2013 hostels.\nChoosing accommodation\nis crucial since the hostel\nis a \u2018safe-house\u2019when one\nis travelling to a foreign\ncountry. You need to be\nable to trust the employees\nthat work there with protecting your belongings,\nproviding good travelling\ntips, and keeping the\ncleanliness of your bed.\nTrust me, you don\u2019t want\nto wake up in the middle\nof the night playing hide\nand seek with bed bugs.\nOne popular site trusted\nby many backpackers is\nHostelWorld. I usually\nprioritise reading reviews\nabout security, cleanli-ness, and value for money,\nwhile the rest are bonuses.\nWhen staying at backpacker hostels, you\u2019ll\nmost often encounter\nlike-minded people that\ntravel from different\ncorners of the world, so\ndon\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cHi\u201d\nand introduce yourself! To\nme, sharing experiences\nis like viewing the world\nthrough the story-teller\u2019s\neyes, and you grow a different perspective as you\ngo along the journey and\nmeet even more people.\nIt\u2019s a rare and unique\nlearning experience, especially for people like me\nwho had lived in Malaysia\nfor most of my life.\nSpecial tips\nDisclaimer: the following are activities which\nI found to be fun, but\nyou might not find such\nexperiences to be equally\nentertaining.\nIf you\u2019re visiting\nVietnam and are of the adventurous type, definitely\ntry to buy a motorbike for\neither the Hanoi\u2013Ho Chi\nMinh or Ho Chi Minh\u2013\nHanoi bike trip (then sell it\noff at the destination city).\nI didn\u2019t have a chance to\ntry the long journeys but\ntook short trips between\ncities and had a hell of a\nlot of fun. Rated as one of\nthe most scenic highway\nin Vietnam, Hai Van Pass\nis where I rode during\nmy time in Danang. Then\nagain, riding a motorbike\nin Vietnam requires good\nto excellent driving skills\nduetoitstrafficconditions,\nthat can only be described\nas wild. It\u2019s also worth\nnoting that such motorbike journeys are illegal\nunless you have a driving\nlicence recognised by the\n\u201cTrust me, you\ndon\u2019t want to\nwake up in the\nmiddle of the\nnight playing\nhide and seek\nwith bed bugs\u201d\nVietnamese government,\nso do it at your own risk.\nOther than that, if you are\nan avid hiker, the south of\nVietnam would suit you\nvery much! Places such as\nSapa are straight out of a\nchildren\u2019s fairy tale if you\nask me \u2013 people live in a\nvalley with symmetrical\npaddy fields running all\nalong both sides. If you\ngo during the right season,\nthe views will be exceptionally memorable.\nIn Cambodia, an\namazing backpacking\nhostel, known as Monkey\nMaya, is located at\nReam National Park,\nSinhanoukville. Only 30\nminutes away by tuk-tuk\nThe scenic view along the valleys of Sapa, Vietnam // YanKai Kee\nfrom the main city, the\nplace is a quiet nature\nhostel, perfect if you want\nto escape from the hustle\nand bustle. I was there\nfor three nights and absolutely loved the vibes.\nThe staff is a mix of locals\nand Europeans that aren\u2019t\nshy to share their hostel\u2019s\nweird and funky culture.\nFinally, for the country\nI grew up in, Malaysia,\nthe two main destinations\nI\u2019ll introduce are Penang\nand Tioman Island, both\nof which are islands along\nthe east and west coasts\nof Peninsular Malaysia\n(West Malaysia). In\nPenang, go for the local\nfood, but don\u2019t just rely\non the internet as the\nlocals always know\nbetter places. In Tioman\nIsland (personal favourite\nhere), there are several\nvillages which you can\nstay in. I recommend\nGenting village as it has\na good balance between\ncivilisation and nature: it\noffers accessibility to the\ninternet and food, yet it\u2019s\nrural enough not to lose\nthe vibes of a small Malay\nvillage by the beach. In\naddition, other than being\na diving and snorkelling\nheaven, Tioman is not\nshort of adventurous\nhiking trails where a local\nguide is needed.\nEd.: To find out\nmore about YanKai\u2019s\ntravelling experiences\nor get more tips, you\ncan visit his Instagram\n(@yankai_77).\n\n"

Beresford\u2019s play\nhas a feel-good vibe that\nsometimes feels like\nsuperficiality.\nThe play is indeed more\nthan three hours long,\nwith enough scope for two\nintervals \u2013 but this is necessary to cater to the rich\nand complex material, and\nthe moments rarely drag.\nWe are stimulated by the\nenergetic atmosphere,\nwhich is enhanced by\nthe special effects that\naccompany the dramatic\naction. They sometimes\nhave a showy quality\nbut occasionally, when\ncombined with seamless\nacting, are very successful\nin creating an emotional\nambience that holds the\nspectator in thrall of the\nactor\u2019s performance.\nDespite the title, it is\nabove all Alexander\u2019s\nperspective, that of an\nimaginative and sensitive\nchild, which we experience throughout Stephen\nBeresford\u2019s stage adaptation of Ingmar Bergman\u2019s\nsemi-autobiographical\nfilm. The stage version is\nmoderately successful at\nretaining the integrity of\nthe original in its exploration of broad existential\nthemes, which may not\nbe condensed down to an\nhour or so\u2019s entertainment\nwithout cutting through\nthe vital nerves and lifeblood of this intricate\nweb of human turmoil.\nThe enjoyment is mostly\nderived from the drama\nbeing well-played by a\nskillful cast.\nThe play begins on\nChristmas Day \u2013 ideal\nfor some reminiscing, in\nwhich Dame Penelope\nWilton indulges and\nis comically pathetic\nwithout pathos. She is the\nmatriarch of the theatrical\nEkdahl family, charming\nand ridiculous with her\nimperiousairsandaffected\nmanners, a hangover from\nher years on the stage.\nDame Wilton manages to\nbe nuanced with a touch\nof grey-haired dignity\nand much wistfulness for\nher bygone years. Though\ntime hasn\u2019t faded her\nromance with a family\nfriend, and something in\nher manner convinces us\nshe was beautiful in youth.\nHer son is Alexander\u2019s\nfather: in the play, a\nchildish, cocky embarrassment of a husband; in\nthe film weary and passive\nwith more than the usual\namount of melancholy for\nhis age. Before the drama\nyet unfolds, he delivers\na speech that ought to\nsound pensive in shallow\nand unconvincing tones.\nIt serves as a prologue to\nthe play and meditates\nupon the purpose of\ntheatre itself, in a strange\nintercrossing of worlds\nbetween the stage and real\nlife; the purpose of the\ntheatre, he concludes, is to\nprovide a few moments\u2019\nrefuge from the harshness\nof life, whilst mirroring it\nat the same time.\nFanny and Alexander\nsucceeds quite well: fan-tasticalelementsofghosts,\ntelepathy and magic are\neffective at transporting\nus to a parallel world, and\nto some extent at obliv-iating the mundane. But\nthese remain primarily\ntools that symbolize and\nabstract the character\u2019s\nsufferings and allow us to\nenter their imaginations,\nseeing the world as they\nexperience it.\nBeresford\u2019s production\nseems to include a marked\ndivide between the realms\nof the living and the dead\nwhich is less present\nin the film. Dinnertime\nscenes include the lavish\nmenu being read out by\ntwo servants, whilst the\nEkdahl family mime\nthe merry enjoyment of\nsimple pleasures. These\nsometimes occur right\nnext to more emotionally\ntense scenes, such as one\nin which Alexander is\nwrestling with his fears\nand talking to the image\nof Death. This contrast\nbetween two worlds,\ndesigned to be unsettling\nthough sometimes not\nsubtle enough to feel\ncoherent, provides a\nsinister undercurrent of\nevil foreshadowing, and\nattempts to lay bare the\nfears within each human\nbeing. The reconciliation\nof these opposing forces\nfinds itself in the rambling\nspeech of a joyful Ekdahl\nas he beholds his newborn\ndaughter: \u201cIt is necessary\nand not in the least bit\nshameful to take pleasure\nin the little world - good\nfood, gentle smiles, fruit\ntrees in bloom, waltzes.\u201d\nJust as the dead remain\nin our minds, in the play\nthey appear as stage\nfigures. Alexander\u2019s\nfather returns as a serene\nwhite-suited apparition,\nhis brutal stepfather as a\nGrim Reaper. In each case\nwe are left wondering\nas to whether these are\nsimply representations of\ntraumatic grief or fear, or\nwhether the supernatural\nis an element of reality\nin the plot. We are left\nunsure as to where the\ndivision between imagination and reality lies in\nAlexander\u2019s mind. The\nambiguity is concluded\nwith a quote from Johann\nAugust Strindberg\u2019s A\nDream Play: \u201cEverything\ncan happen. Everything\nis possible and probable.\nTime and space do not\nexist. On a flimsy framework of reality, the imagination spins, weaving new\npatterns.\u201d\nThe stage adaptation of Ingrid Bergman\u2019s semi-autobiographical work \u201cweaves new patterns\u201d.\nThat feeling when you\u2019re not invited to the impromtu seance.... // Manuel Harlan\nARTS\nPauline Ronnet\nArts Writer\nWhere? The Old Vic\nWhen? 21st\nFebruary - 14th\nApril\nHow Much? From \u00a312\nFANNY AND\nALEXANDER\nSummer and Smoke sizzles with spectacular sentiment\nin stunning revival\nI\nt is a time-tested\ndichotomy \u2013 the\nbody versus the soul,\nthe mind, with its\nemotions and intellect,\nversus the body\u2019s sensual\nphysical pleasures. The\nbattle between the two\nis the focus of one of\nTennessee Williams\u2019\nearliest and rarely-per-formed plays, Summer\nand Smoke. In a stunning\nnew revival by young director Rebecca Frecknall,\nWilliams\u2019 lesser-known\nplay is performed in its\nfull emotional intensity,\nsuccessfully drawing\ntension out throughout the\nthree hours.\nPatsy Ferran delivers a\nbrilliant performance as\nAlma, a pastor\u2019s daughter\nand singing teacher\nwhose prudish, formal\nupbringing leads her to\nsuppress her long-time\nlove for childhood friend\nand trainee doctor John\nBuchanan, eschewing\nphysical pleasures for\nspiritual and intellectual\nfulfilment. This undeclared love nearly drives\nher mad, and it is this\nunspoken tension that\nFerran embodies so well.\nAlma\u2019s nervous laugh\nand formal diction serve\nto hide the emotions that\nare churning inside her.\nJohn, on the other hand,\nrepresents the body in\nall its physicality \u2013 the\nfact that he is a doctor,\ninterested in all the guts\nand \u2018ugly things\u2019 that\nare inside our bodies, is\ncontrasted with Alma\u2019s\nspiritual background.\nMatthew Needham, who\nplays John, has a stare\nso intense that it almost\nseems he can see right\nthrough Alma and into\nthe turmoil of unfulfilled\ndesire.\nOriginally called\nThe Anatomy Chart,\nWilliams\u2019 play is full of\nsymbolism and contrasts.\nThe anatomy chart hangs\nin John\u2019s office, and in\none scene he grabs Alma\nand makes her look at\nthe chart, telling her that\nthere is nothing inside\nher but organs hungry\nfor food, knowledge and\nsex \u2013 there is none of this\n\u2018soul\u2019 that she repeatedly\nmentions. John embraces\nthis version of the body,\nand seeks immediate gratification for his desires,\nspending every night at the\ncasino, and sleeping with\nRosa, the casino owner\u2019s\nbeautiful daughter.\nWilliams is known for\nhis concept of \u2018plastic\ntheatre\u2019: favouring a\nmore malleable theatrical\nprocess that relies less on\nrealism and more heavily\non the effect of sound,\ncolour, movement and\nlighting to create evocative images on stage.\nFrecknall developed this\nconcept beautifully in\nthis production, with fluid\nscene changes on the same\nset created using these\nextra-textual elements\nalone.\nThe set itself was\nfascinating: nine pianos,\nstripped bare so one can\nsee the strings inside, are\narranged in a semicircle\nbordering a dusty space.\nThe cast play on these\npianos from time to time to\ncreate atmosphere -Angus\nMacRae\u2019s score complements and accentuates the\ntension and emotions per-fectly. Dissonant sounds\nclashing among the pianos\nbring out Alma\u2019s clashing\ninner turmoil, while\ngrand, harmonised motifs\naccompany major scenes\nand emotional intensity.\nFurthermore, the use of\nlight was integral to the\nshow and was cleverly integrated into the piano set.\nIn an impressive touch,\nfireworks were represented by lights running across\nthe piano strings while\ngentle bursts of light rose\nbehind the pianos. Indeed,\nthe light and sound\ndesign, and the flexibility\nof a cast moving among\npianos making music that\nthreads seamlessly in and\nout of the scenes, is a\nunique touch that respects\nWilliams\u2019 style.\nThe shooting of John\u2019s\nfather, a respected doctor,\nleads to a dramatic turn\nof events as John goes\noff to finish his father\u2019s\ngood work, while Alma,\ntortured by her conflicting\nvalues and desires, withdraws from the outside\nworld. When they meet\nagain, Alma has changed.\nShe is now ready to\nembrace her desires \u2013 the\nold Alma, the spiritual,\nsexually-repressed Alma,\nis gone, she says. \u2018The girl\nwho said \u2018no\u2019\u2013 she doesn\u2019t\nexist anymore, she died\nlast summer \u2013 suffocated\nin smoke from something\non fire inside her.\u2019\nThe idea of smoke,\nits ethereal, ephemeral\nquality, is stylistically\nimportant in the play,\nas is the fiery quality of\nsummer. Alma\u2019s previous\nself goes up in smoke,\nbut so do her hopes and\ndesires: because after the\nshooting John has changed\nas well, developing a\nmore spiritual outlook on\nlife. He now views his\nrelationship with Alma\nas a spiritual connection,\nand attributes his change\nto something she has\ninspired. She has become,\nto him, untouchable like\nthe angel of the fountain\nunder which they meet in\nthe first scene.\nThis production of\nSummer and Smoke is\nexcellent all round, and\nrightly puts the play out\nthere again in an impressive revival with a stellar\ncast, visionary direction\nand innovative design.\nRebecca Frecknall directs a winning revival of one of Tennessee WIlliams\u2019 lesser-known plays\nWho stares into my soul?// Marc Brenner\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Since\ntheir final album, Naked,\nin 1988, he\u2019s released a\nstring of semi-successful\nsolo albums and collaborative projects with the\nlikes of Brian Eno and St.\nVincent. Something of a\nrenaissance man, Byrne\nhas dabbled in art, film\nand theatre; earning himself a Grammy, an Oscar,\nand a Golden Globe in the\nprocess.

You\u2019d be\nforgiven for assuming\nthat American Utopia\nmust be ironically titled,\nbut Byrne assures us this\nisn\u2019t so. Part of his multimedia project Reasons\nto be Cheerful, the\nrecord\u2019s message is one of\noptimism and positivity.\nIt\u2019s an interesting sidestep\nfrom a man who built a\ncareer out of channelling\nmodern life\u2019s anxieties.\nInstead of expressing his\ndisillusion at society\u2019s\ncommodities (think\n\u2018Once in a Lifetime\u2019), he\ncelebrates the art of the\nordinary and champions\nthe mundane in campfire\nstyle sing-alongs. \u2018Every\nDay is a Miracle\u2019, with\nall its farmyard imagery\n(\u201cNow the chicken\nimagines a heaven / Full\nof roosters and plenty of\ncorn / And God is a very\nold rooster / And eggs\nare like Jesus, his son\u201d),\ncomes across as more of a\nSunday school ditty than a\npiece of avant-rock.\nsuch as \u2018Bullet\u2019 (an ode\nto a gunshot wound) and\n\u2018Dog\u2019s Mind\u2019 (\u201cWe are\ndogs in our own paradise\n/ In a theme park of our\nown / Doggy dancers\ndoing doody / Doggy\ndreaming all day long\u201d)\njust come across as plain\nweird. Byrne has also\ncome under fire for the\nlack of diversity in his\nproduction team \u2013 25 men\n- zero women - for which\nhe publicly apologised,\ncalling his decisions\n\u201cnegligent\u201d.\nAll this is not to say\nthat Byrne isn\u2019t still at\nthe pinnacle of his art,\nit\u2019d be unfair to say he\u2019s\nlost touch. But, though it\npains me, it\u2019s clear that\nhe\u2019s really missed the\nmark on this one.\nIt takes a village to raise a song\nF\nittingly, my\ndebut review is\nSuperorganism\u2019s\nself-titled debut\nalbum, released at the\nbeginning of March.\nSuperorganism is a band\nformed by bonding\nover memes and Skype\nrehearsals. Seven of their\neight members currently\nreside in East London\nwith eighth member, Soul,\nliving in Sydney. In group\nphotos they use a large\ncut-out of Soul\u2019s face. The\nband\u2019s mix of nationalities\nand backgrounds shines\nthrough in these 10 songs\nchampioned by Domino\nRecords. The album\nprovides 33 minutes of\ngloriously eclectic motifs,\nunusual soundbites and\nmeticulous lyrics. (\u201cOh,\nhave you ever woke up\nfrom a daydream / And\nrealised that the world\u2019s\ngone crazy? / You people\nare all the same / Going\nblah blah blah, going bang\nbang bang\u201d).\nMy main issue with this\nalbum is its bitty nature,\nthe overwhelming use\nof fragmented samples\nin places can make for\nfrustrating listening. I\ncan\u2019t help but think that\nif \u2018Nai\u2019s March\u2019 was to\ncome on during your\nSpotify shuffle it would\nbe skipped, not enjoyed.\nThat being said, the\nalbum flows well from\nstart to finish with the\nmost notable tracks being\n\u2018Night Time\u2019 and the\nsingles \u2018Everybody Wants\nto Be Famous\u2019 and \u2018Something For Your M.I.N.D\u2019,\nwhere the immersive\nsounds pull through.\nWhilst the dreamy\ntones and quirkiness go\npart way to making up for\nthe lack of depth, it is far\nfrom revolutionary and I\npersonally believe it could\nhave been curated slightly\nmore carefully to give it\nthat edge and storyline.\nI can imagine what a\nmagnificently energetic\nlive gig this would be, an\n8-piece trying to groove\ntheir way onto the indie/\npsychedelic pop scene.\nYou can find them in\nLondon, following their\n17-date North American\nTour, on 25th\nMay.

We need to try and break this trend, but could 2018 be the\nbreakout year for women in cinema?\nFILM\nAshley Luckyram\nFilm Editor\n\u201cSo rarely do\nwe see films\nled by women,\nand even\nrarer made by\nwomen\u201d\nH\nollywood is\nnarcissistic.\nA community\nthat reflects the\nvanity and self-obsession\nof its constituents, when\nTinseltown reflects back\non 2017 they will not\nremember it for the Fall\nof Mosul, the Rohingya\nCrisis, or the ousting of\nRobert Mugabe, but for\nthe wave of allegations\nof sexual misconduct that\nsaw a number of La-La\nLand\u2019s power players \u2013\nfrom Kevin Spacey to\nDustin Hoffman \u2013 banished to the shadows. The\nwatershed moment came\nin October, with almost\n100 different women\naccusing producer Harvey\nWeinstein of varying\ndegrees of sexual assault;\nsince then the number\nof accused men in the\nentertainment industry\nstands at around 200. It\nis disturbing to think that\nup until this recent tipping\npoint these men were able\nto get away with such vile\nactions, highlighting just\nwhat a colossal change in\nvictims, to the extent that\nsome even sympathised\nwith the former and\nsuggested that the latter\nmight just be disingen-uous. While it is important that we allow due\nprocess and understand\nthe difference between\nallegations and confirmed\nguilt, the National Sexual\nViolence Resource Centre\nestimates that just 2% of\nsexual assault accusations\nare false. If someone is\naccused of sexual mis-conduct, there is statistically a pretty good chance\nthey did it. USA Today\nobserved fairly early on\nthat 2017 was the year in\nwhich sexual harassment\nbecame a fireable offence\n\u2013 a long overdue devel-opment. It is easy to see\nwhy the likes of Michael\nHaneke and Catherine\nDeneuve have expressed\nconcerns about the\nmomentum of the Weinstein Effect, and the story\nthat broke about Aziz\nAnsari did give weight\nto their argument that the\n#MeToo and Time\u2019s Up\nmovements have the potential to turn into a witch\nhunt. What is clear is that\nthey are the beginnings\nof a belated conversation\nwhereby society can\nhopefully start to reshape\nand redefine what is and is\nnot appropriate behaviour,\nand move to a new equilibrium that makes for\nsafe and happy lives for\neveryone.\nThe ramifications of\nthe Weinstein Effect have\nbeen wide-spreading. It\nis worth noting that he is\nnot just a man guilty of\nforcing women to engage\nin sexual acts with him in\nexchange for lubricating\nthe progression of their\ncareers. Weinstein, both\nwith his first venture into\nthe film industry with\nMiramax, and later with\nThe Weinstein Company,\nis also a bully. While he\nmade a huge contribution\nto American independent cinema, launching\nthe careers of the likes\nof Steven Soderbergh,\nQuentin Tarantino, and\nDavid O. Russell, as well\nas providing an audience\nfor international fare from\nsuch names as Krzysztof\nKie\u015blowski, Pedro\nAlmod\u00f3var, and Abbas\nKiarostami, Weinstein is\nrenowned for his beyond\naggressive campaigns\nduring awards season,\nmanaging to as recently as\nlast year drive the average\nLion to six Academy\nAward nominations by\nthrowing around his\nsignificant weight. It was\na much welcomed change\nto have a much cleaner\nand more respectful Oscar\nrace this year. Far more\nsignificantly, however, the\nbehaviour of Weinstein\nand others has led to\na lobbying for greater,\ndeserved female empow-erment.\nIn addition to a\nconversation about the\nundercurrents of sexual\npractice, there has been\nmuch discussion about\nthe marginalisation of\nwomen in film. So rarely\ndo we see films led by\nwomen, and even rarer\nis the film created from a\nfemale perspective. While\nthe likes of Lady Bird,\nThree Billboards Outside\nEbbing, Missouri, The\nShape of Water, Phantom\nThread, and The Post all\nfeatured strong female\ncharacters in leading\nroles, in 2017 only 11%\nof films were made by\nwomen, a figure that has\nnot increased since 2000.\nAs well as delivering\nmore positive portrayals\nof women on screen, we\nneed to get more women\nworking behind the\ncamera. There was much\ncelebration when Greta\nGerwig became only the\nfifth women to be nominated for Best Director\nand Rachel Morrison\nbecame the first woman\nnominated for Best Cinematography. Yet if we\ndo not make changes at a\ngrassroots level, and have\nmore studios, production\ncompanies, and independent financiers invest in\nwomen, it will be difficult\nto see women like Gerwig\nregularly nominated.\nSpeaking from a purely\nstatistical perspective,\nwhen there are only five\nslots available for Best\nDirector, and only one\nin ten contending films\nis made by a woman (a\nfigure even lower if one\naccounts for the type of\nmini-major studio films\nthat tend to garner awards\nattention), it would be\nunlikely to have a woman\nnominated in the category\nevery year.\nIt must be said that\n2017 was a very good\nyear for female directors,\nif not in quantity then in\nquality and prominence.\nGerwig\u2019s Lady Bird led\nthat narrative, earning\nfive Oscar nominations\nas one of the year\u2019s best\nreviewed films. Patty\nJenkins was the other big\nstory, delivering a colossal\nbox office success with\nWonder Woman, and\nbeing rewarded with a\nsequel that comes with\na $10 million pay day.\nLooking beyond those two\nheadline-makers, there\nwas significant acclaim\nfor Lynne Ramsay (You\nWere Never Really Here),\nJane Campion (Top of the\nLake: China Girl), Chloe\nZhao (The Rider), Claire\nDenis (Let the Sunshine\nIn), Agnes Varda (Faces\nPlaces), Naomi Kawase\n(Radiance), and Sofia\nCoppola (The Beguiled)\nat Cannes, while the\nsummer saw Kathryn\nBigelow, thus far the\nonly woman to win the\nAcademy Award for Best\nDirector, return with\nanother gritty and truthful\ndrama with Detroit.\nGoing back earlier in the\nyear, there was acclaim\nat Sundance for Dee\nRees (Mudbound), Eliza\nHittman (Beach Rats),\nMaggie Betts (Novitiate),\nZoe Lister-Jones (Band\nAgn\u00e9s Varda with a furry friend // Le Pacte\n\u201cIt is\ndisturbing\nto think that\nup until this\nrecent tipping\npoint men\nwere able\nto get away\nwith such vile\nactions\u201d\nculture is required.\nEven more worrying\nhas been the focus on the\nperpetrators and not the\ndirectors into the film industry?\n\u201cIt is\nunfathomable\nPatty Jenkins\nhad to wait 14\nyears to follow\nup her debut\u201d\n\u201cThe success\nof Lady Bird\nwas hailed to\nthe heavens,\nand called the\nfirst female-centred\ncoming-of-age\nfilm\u201d\nAid), Gillian Robbespierre\n(Landline), Kitty Green\n(Casting JonBenet),\nMaya Forbes (The Polka\nKing), Cate Shortland\n(Berlin Syndrome), and\nHelene Hegemann (Axotl\nOverkill) in a line-up\nthat was close to 50%\nfemale, indicating a wave\nof change at independent\nlevel. Ilyik\u00f3 Enyedi\u2019s On\nBody and Soul won the\ntop prize in Berlin, and\nwent on to earn a Best\nForeign Language Film\nnomination, a race in\nwhich Angelina Jolie was\nunexpectedly snubbed\nfor First They Killed\nMy Father. At the same\nfestival, Sally Potter (The\nParty) and Agnieska\nHolland (Spoor) had work\nwell received. Even if Ana\nLily Amirpour\u2019s The Bad\nBatch was a critical and\nbox office bomb, it was\nrefreshing to see a young\nwoman able to take risks\nand create a work of such\nsingular vision.\nThere are still questions\nmarks amidst this wave of\npositive change, however.\nIt is unfathomable that\nPatty Jenkins, having\ndirected Charlize Theron\nto the Oscar in one of the\ngreatest performances of\nthe century in Monster,\nhad to wait 14 years\nto follow up her debut\nfeature. Ramsay returned\nafter six years, during\nwhich time she had a tumultuous affair in charge\nof Jane Got a Gun which\nsaw her quit in the first\nmorning of production.\nThat earned her a reputation as being difficult to\nwork with, a tag she has\nreferred to as \u201cbullshit\u201d.\nAs Mark Kermode rightly\nobserved, were Ramsay a\nman she would be more\nlikely to be labelled a\nperfectionist and a genius.\nIt will be interesting\nnow to see whether last\nyear\u2019s success for female\ndirectors, most notably\nGerwig and Jenkins, will\ntranslate into a consistent\nmarch towards equality\nbehind the camera. It will\nevidently take a number\nof years to properly assess\nthe impact of the recent\nshake up in Hollywood on\ncinema, as of course we\nwill not see any projects\nthat are now benefiting\nfor another couple of\nyears, but the early indications in terms of festival\nline-ups and distribution\nfor women this coming\nyear are good. Sundance\nagain seems to be leading\nthe way: Desiree Akhavan\u2019s The Miseducation\nof Cameron Post took\nthe top prize, beating out\nwork from Jennifer Fox\n(The Tale), Reed Morano\n(I Think We\u2019re Alone\nNow), and Christina\nChoe (Nancy) in the U.S.\ninto long periods of inactivity by studios reluctant\nto back them in spite of\ntheir critical and commercial success.\nThere is also much\nto look forward to later\nin the year. Earlier this\nweek Julia Hart\u2019s latest\nFast Color was warmly\nreceived at South by\nSouthwest. Early reactions to Ava DuVernay\u2019s A\nWrinkle in Time have been\nmixed, but that should\nnot take away from the\nfact that she is only the\nfourth female director to\nhave been given a budget\nof above $100 million.\nJosie Rourke, best known\nfor adapting Shakespeare\nwith a feminist spin on\nstage, will make her cinematic debut in November,\npitting Saoirse Ronan\nagainst Margot Robbie\nin potential awards contender Mary, Queen of\nScots. Alice Winocour,\nknown for her underrated\nthriller Disorder, deals\nwith astronauts in her next\nfeature Proxima, starring\nEva Green. Another acclaimed French director\nheading to space is Claire\nDenis, making her English-language debut High\nLife with Robert Pattinson\nin the lead. Pattinson also\nstars in the first part of\nJoanna Hogg\u2019s Martin\nScorsese-produced dou-ble-header The Souvenir.\nLike Pattinson, Nicole\nKidman is one of the best\nactors in the business\nwhen it comes to choosing\nprojects from interesting\nfilmmakers across the\nglobe. Karyn Kusama\u2019s\nThe Invitation was one\nof the best horror films\nof recent years. They\nteam up for crime thriller\nDestroyer this year. Elle\nFanning has become the\nface of teenage angst\nin cinema over the past\ncouple of years, and she\nwill continue in this vein\nin M\u00e9lanie Laurent\u2019s\nadaptation of Galveston,\na novel by True Detective\nshowrunner Nic Pizzolatto. Laurent is best known\nto English-speaking\naudiences for her role\nas Shosanna Dreyfus in\nInglourious Basterds, but\nshe has already shown\nserious chops as a screenwriter and filmmaker for\none so young.\nThe success of Lady\nBird was hailed to the\nheavens, and called by\nsome the first female-cen-tred coming-of-age film\nfrom a female director.\nAnyone that suggests that\nhas a short memory and\nhas forgotten Marielle\nHeller\u2019s excellent The\nDiary of a Teenage Girl.\nJennifer Kent\u2019s debut\nThe Babadook has been\nattributed to many a night-mare. She heads to 1920s\nTasmania for The Nightingale, which she claimed is\nnot a horror, though that\nis exactly what somebody\nwho was actually making\na horror would say. On\nthe television front it will\nbe interesting to see how\nAndrea Arnold furthers\nJean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s work\nin Big Little Lies.\nThis year\u2019s Berlin Film\nFestival featured a panel\nnamed 50:50 by 2020.\nRather than giving in to\nthe pressure to lay out\na black carpet in lieu of\nthe traditional red one,\nfestival director Dieter\nKosslick demanded that\nwe have frank and intelligent conversations about\nthe deep-seated issues\nsurrounding the treatment\nof women in film, instead\nof the meaningless\ndisplays designed more\nto protect the images of\nHollywood\u2019s elite than\ndrive real, important\nchange. For us to jump\nfrom 10:90 to 50:50 in\nthree years is perhaps too\nambitious a target. That\nsaid, it appears as though\nwe are in the midst of\na significant paradigm\nshift, and hopefully soon\nthe stories of Harvey\nWeinstein\u2019s seedy hotel\nroom massages, of Mark\nWahlberg being paid\nmillions as Michelle\nWilliams is paid $800\nfor reshoots, and of Patty\nJenkins having to wait\n14 years to make her\nsophomore effort will\nbe a distant, unsettling\nmemory \u2013 a stom-ach-churning reminder of\nour ugly failures and the\nshameful way we have\ndeprived of ourselves of\ngreat art in the name of\nnarrow-minded bigotry.\nLady Bird saw Greta Gerwig getting behind the camera // A24\nDramatic Competiton.\nElsewhere, Elizabeth\nChomko (What They\nHad), Claire McCarthy\n(Ophelia), Cathy Yan\n(Dead Pigs) and Isabella\nEkl\u00f6f (Holiday) had\nfilms play, while there\nwere welcome returns\nfor Debra Granik (Leave\nNo Trace) and Tamara\nJenkins (Private Life).\nGranik has not made a\nnarrative feature in eight\nyears since she launched\nJennifer Lawrence\u2019s\ncareer on the way to four\nOscar nominations for\nWinter\u2019s Bone, while\nJenkins (no relation to\nPatty) has not released\nany work in eleven years\nsince The Savages got two\nOscar nods back in 2007.\nThe examples of Granik\nand Jenkins demonstrate a\nworrying trend of female\nfilmmakers being forced\n\n"

Air\ntemperatures dropped to a\n27-year low, and \u2013 much\nto everyone\u2019s bother \u2013\nsignal failures and track\nproblems disrupted the\ntube services citywide.\nIf you ventured out that\nweek wondering if you\nhad walked through a\nportal to Siberia, you\nactually were not too far\nfrom the truth!\nIt was a vortex of cold\nSiberian air \u2013 nicknamed\nthe \u2018Beast from the\nEast\u2019 \u2013 which caused\ntemperatures in the UK\nto plummet so drastically.\nThe stream of northern\npolar air, which originally\nlingered at a very chilly\n-50C, had unexpectedly\nchanged its wintry path\nto the east, swooping over\nthe UK instead!\nThis was due to what\nmeteorologists refer to as\na Sudden Stratospheric\nWarming, an unprecedented increase in the temperature of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere between 10-50km\nabove the surface. In this\natmospheric region, jet\nstreams of air currents\ntravel round the world\nfrom west to east with\na special polar night jet\nforming in winter months\nthat is seen to encircle\nthe area surrounding the\nEarth\u2019s poles. Occasionally, changes in weather\npatterns or increases in\npressure within the atmosphere of the Northern\nHemisphere may disturb\nthe westerly winds and\ndisrupt the smooth flow\nof the polar night jets. The\ndistortion of these polar\njets could be powerful\nenough to reduce, and\neven reverse, the direction\nof the westerly winds.\nAdditionally, the high-lat-itude stratospheric air\nstarts to compress over\nthe polar ice caps; during\ncompression it can warm\nby up to 50C in just a few\ndays. This results in newly\nredirected easterly winds\nwhich sink lower in the\natmosphere, disrupting\nthe polar vortex, causing\nthe cold jet streams to\nflow further south than\nusual.\n\u201cIt was a\nvortex of cold\nSiberian air\n\u2013the\u2018Beast\nfrom the East\u2019\n\u2013which caused\ntemperatures\nto plummet\u201d\n\u201cWe have to\nrealise the\nweather we\nexperience\nnow is just\na physical\nramification of\nmany complex\nsystems\naround the\nglobe\u201d\nIn February, this very\nphenomenon resulted in\nthe biting-cold Siberian\nair streams swerving\naround the UK, bringing\nthe unusual cold spell to\nLondon. The weakened\nwesterly jet streams were\nnot powerful enough to\nbring warm air from the\nAtlantic over to the UK.\nThis resulted in a blanket\nof crisp white (and later\ngrey and slushy) snow for\na week!\nLooking back to a\ncouple of months ago,\nthere was a similar oc-currence, as a significant\namount of snow over the\ncity descended, the likes\nof which were unseen\nsince 2012! But the big\nquestion is whether it is\nclimate change that is\ncausing these unprecedented weather patterns.\nLargely, climate change\naffects different regions\nin different ways, and this\nis a highly debatable topic\namongst experts in the\nfield. Scientists generally\ndo concur, however, that\nhuman activity releasing\ngreenhouse gases has\ndefinitely contributed to\nthe global climate shifts.\nThe direct results are\ncomplicated, but the especially low winter temperatures this year provide\nsupport for the argument\nof climate change.\nIn fact, many scientists\nthink this is the precursor\nto more extreme and\nunpredictable weather\nfor future years to come.\nWhat is worrying many\nclimatologists is that\nthere has recently been\nan extraordinarily intense\nheatwave in the Arctic,\ndespite it experiencing\nno direct sunlight since\nOctober. Temperatures\nin the Arctic have been\nrecorded as warmer than\nthose in London, New\nYork, and Paris at any\none time! Furthermore, in\nJanuary, the US National\nSnow and Ice Data\nCenter (NSIDC) released\nnews that the Arctic sea\nice cover had shrunk\nto a \u201cnew record low\u201d\nof 5.04 million square\nmiles. This rate of sea ice\ndepletion is currently the\nhighest in at least 1,500\nyears, according to the\nUS National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration, which was published\nlast December. Global\nclimate systems are highly\ndependent and sensitive\non each other, and such\ndrastic changes in one\npart of the world will\nhave huge implications on\nother regions.\nthat the weather patterns\nweexperiencenowarejust\nthe physical ramifications\nof many complex systems\noperating at various locations around the globe,\nand are functions of many,\nmany different factors.\nBut at least for us here\nin London, winter is now\n(hopefully) over! As we\nare all gearing up for the\ncoming of spring, we\ndo not have to suffocate\nunder a mountain of\nfleeces, scarves, gloves,\nand hats anymore\u2026right?\nDefinitely! Despite yellow\nwarnings for snow and ice\nstill being issued across\nthe UK amidst concerns\nof Storm Emma, these\nare mostly concentrated\nin northern England and\nScotland. Thus, London\nseems to be off the hook in\nterms of slushy pavements\nand runny noses \u2013 at least\nfor now.\nIs it cold in your snowstorm, freezing your brain? // Felix\nWhile we cannot be\nsure whether this is simply\na shocking anomaly, or\nthe start of a new weather\ntrend, we have to realise\nI can show you the world: How gene therapy brightens\nthe future for eye diseases\nDevelopments in gene therapy could offer hope for a cure to inherited retinal diseases in the near future.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nY\nou may have\nyour mother\u2019s\neyes, or your\nfather\u2019s nose,\nas genetics plays a significant role in determining\nphysical traits such as\nheight and eye colour. But\ngenes can also determine\nother things: diseases!\nCystic fibrosis is an example of a disease that has\na genetic basis, meaning\nthat the conditions can be\npassed on to subsequent\ngenerations.\nGenes are the information that our bodies\nhold, so our cells know\nhow to react in certain\nenvironments. Imagine a\nconstruction worker: she\nobtains her information\nfrom the blueprint (i.e.\ngenes), and from these instructions is able to build\nan object. Simple, right?\nUnfortunately not!\nErrors do occur, and the\nblueprint can contain\nmistakes. In the case of\ninherited retinal diseases,\na group of conditions that\naffect the eyes, this can\nresult in symptoms such\nas blurred eyesight, and\neventually loss of central\nvision.\nResearch has indicated\nthat the cause of at least\nfive types of inherited\nretinal diseases stem from\nan erroneous gene known\nas BEST1: it contains\ninformation that builds\nchannels to allow substances such as calcium\nions to be transported\nin and out of the cells.\nSubsequently, this allows\nthese cells to interact with\nthe surrounding nerve\ncells. A faulty form of the\nBEST1 gene causes these\ncells in the eyes, namely\nthe retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), to lose\nfunction, resulting in\ndetachment of the RPE.\nPreviously proven in\nmouse and canine models,\nthe integrity of RPE is\nvital to the general health\nof the eye, as it maintains\nthe correct environment\nfor other nearby cells.\nAny detachment of the\nRPE, large or small,\ncan impact the health\nof photoreceptors \u2013 the\ncells that are essential for\ndetecting light. Thus the\ndisease eventually leads\nto the loss of sight, and is\ncurrently untreatable.\n\u201cTo correct\nthe error,\nscientists have\nbeen trying to\nutilise viruses\nas carriers\u201d\nTo correct this error in\nthe genes, scientists have\ntried to utilise viruses as\ncarriers to transport the\nhealthy copy of the gene\ninto the targeted cell.\nWhile some may fear the\nuse of viruses \u2013 as they are\nnotorious for being infectious and deadly \u2013 broadly\nspeaking, virus carriers\noften have their virulence\nremoved, meaning they\nwould not be able to cause\nany harm once modified.\nThis idea of transferring\nthe healthy copy of the\ngene into a person is\ncalled gene therapy.\nRecently, a group\nfrom the University of\nPennsylvania, led by\nKarina E. Guziewicz, has\ndeveloped a treatment of\nthis type, targeting these\ngenetic forms of macular\ndegeneration in a canine\nmodel. In the model, the\nscientists have identified\nthe molecular mechanisms at which the disease\nis causing issues and\nverified the identity of the\ngene that needs to transported back to the patient\nto reverse the mistake.\nThe researchers used\nadenoviruses (AAV2) to\naugment the BEST1 gene\nin one eye, leaving the\nother eye untreated for\ncomparison. The virus\nthat contained the healthy\ngene was injected into the\nsub-retinal region of the\neye with micro or mac-ro-detachments.\nResults indicated that\nthe host\u2019s immune system\ndid not react to the virus,\nsuggesting the safety of\nsuch a treatment, since\nadverse immune responses can lead to failure of\nthe therapy or result in\nharmful effects on the\nhost. In addition, researchers found the delivery of\nthe healthy BEST1 gene\nis well located, suggesting\nthe viruses are specific to\nthe intended target. Using\nnon-invasive scanning\ntechniques, the researchers also noticed the lesions\nin the treated eyes were\nresolved, showing the\nrestoration of the retinal\nstructure. As mentioned,\nthe structure of the eye is\nessential for maintaining\nnormal vision, therefore\nthis clearly is a step\nforward in curing inherited retinal diseases!\nWhile dog models\nclosely resemble humans,\nfuture research in this\nfield should use human\nmodels with RPE cells to\nfurther prove the safety\nand efficacy of this gene\ntherapy. Furthermore,\nthe group discovered\nthat light stimulation can\nworsen the detachment of\nthe RPE. Since this was\nnot observed in human\npatients previously, more\nwork is needed to establish\nwhether this phenomenon\noccurs in humans too.\n\n"

We\nwould love to return to\nour jobs but the deal on\noffer was truly terrible.\n\u201cThe point of the strikes\nwas to keep the defined\nbenefits pension scheme.\nAll this deal offers is a\ntransitional three years \u2013\nduring which we pay more\nto receive less \u2013 while the\ndefined benefits scheme is\nphased out,\u201d they added.\nIn a statement Dr\nMichael McGarvey,\npresident of Imperial\nUCU, said: \u201cUnder\nintense pressure from\nsenior management of\nuniversities around the\ncountry, UUK stated it\nwould like to meet with\nUCU as soon as possible.\nWe now expect UUK to\ncome back with a serious\noffer that staff can accept\nwhich leads to an end to\nthe dispute.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe hope\nmembers of UUK,\nincluding Imperial\nCollege, will finally act\nresponsibly and help to\nresolve the dispute by\nstopping their attempts to\ndestroy the value of our\npensions for the sake of\nthe students and staff at\nour universities.\u201d\nIf no agreement is\nreached, 14 days of further\nstrikes will go ahead\nbetween April and June.\nDates have not yet been\ndecided but strikes are\nexpected to be organised\naround exams in order to\nmaximise impact.\nIf a fresh deal is\nreached, UCU members\nhope to be given more\ntime to look over the\nproposals \u2013 rather than\nhaving to hold emergency\nmeetings in the street, as\nwas the case at Imperial.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been disappointed in both UUK and\nUCU in their communications with members,\u201d said\nFelix\u2019s UCU source. \u201cWe\nhope any future detail\nis communicated with\nenough detail and time to\nconsider carefully before\na national vote.\u201d\nThe Imperial UCU\nTwitteraccountannounced\nthe postponement of \u201cNot\nthe President\u2019s Address\u201d.\nA UCU-sponsored event\nis planned for the near\nfuture.\nStaff have been striking since the middle of February // Joseph O'Connell-Danes\nStrikes come to an end, as UCU rejects UUK deal\nNEWS\nRobert Tomkies will\nbe the President of\nImperial College\nUnion next year.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\n\n"

This is what\nwe, ICUTKD,\nexperienced last weekend\nat the BSTF Student\nTaekwondo National\nChampionships. Not only\ndid we bring eight golds,\nsix silvers and eight\nbronze medals home,\nbut many other surprises\nawaited us.\nFriday, 9th\nof March.\nHalf past four in the\nafternoon. After a day of\nlectures, we were ready\nfor a five-hour trip to\nWorcester, or that was\nwhat we thought. It did\nnot take long until all of us\nfell asleep in the minibus.\nCertainly, it had been a\nlong week of training and\ndeadlines.\nIn the morning of the\ncompetition, there was\nmuch to look forward\nto. However, this time\nthe tournament was not\nthe only cause, but more\nimportantly our reunion\nwith Ilias Konstantinou,\nour former ICUTKD\nsecretary, who moved out\nlast term. In spite of the\ndistance, he has continued\nsupporting, aiding and\ntaking care of us. At the\n\u201cWe might be\na small team,\nbut you can\nbe certain that\nwe will grow\nstronger and\nstronger each\nyear and reach\nnew heights\u201d\nthe club.\nThe remaining\nmorning, time flew by\nbetween rounds and\nrounds of poomsae, the\npattern discipline of this\nmartial art. A noteworthy\neffort of participants and\ninstructors led to a total\nof four gold, one silver,\nand three bronze medals\nin Individual Patterns\nand Freestyle, obtained\nby: Junling Ong (A-class\nFreestyle), Bryan Chong\n(A-classIndividual),Huey\nShan Tey and Joon-Ho\nSon (B-class Individual)\n-gold-; Menghan Liu\n(B-class Individual)\n-silver- and Junling Ong,\nWenbo Chen (A-class\nIndividual); Andrew\nBates (C-class Individual)\n-bronze- and Cynthia Ho,\nwho got 5th place out of\n28 competitors. Moreover,\nall our poomsae pairs/\nteams climbed the\npodium, achieving one\ngold (Junling and Bryan,\nA-class), two silvers\n(Huey Shan and Joon-Ho,\nB-class and Andrew and\nPilar Zhang, C-class) and\none bronze (Fatima Khan,\nAngela Sun and Wenbo,\nA-class). All these results\nled ICUTKD to become\nthe National Student\nPoomsae Champions,\nwith the best team within\nUK in this category.\nHowever, our thirst for\nbattle didn\u00b4t end there.\nThe following day \u2013\nSunday, 11th\n\u2013 our sparring\ncompetitors joined us. We\ncouldn\u00b4t lose, we wanted\nto meet the expectations\nof our instructors and\ncoaches, to make them\nproud. And so we did.\nOur fighters did not give\nup and fought until the\nreferee announced the Bryan Chong brandishing his Master Suh award, a truly\ngreat accomplishment // ICUTKD\nThree members of ICUTKD getting excited (little do they know of the success to\ncome!) // ICUTKD\n\u201cTaekwondo\nis not about\nthe belt or the\nmedals, but\nabout what\nyou learn and\ntake away\nfrom it\u201d\nand Angela Sun (A-class),\nIlias Konstantinou,\nSophia Ppali (B-class) and\nJennifer Wang (C-class)\nfor bronze.\nAt the end of Nationals,\nthe overall UK Student\nTaekwondo rankings\nwere released. Our team\ncame 2nd\noverall in UK,\nbeating teams of more\nthan twice our size, and\nmost importantly: 1st\nin\nthe Indomitable ranking.\nThe latter evaluates points\nper player, which is a\nbetter measurement of a\nteam\u2019s quality.\nProminent amongst\nthese is the Master Suh\naward, with which our\nVice-Chair \u2013 Bryan\nChong \u2013 was honoured\nfor his exceptional and\ncontinuous service to the\nBritish Student Taekwondo Federation (BSTF) this\nyear. We are proud and\nthrilled to see his hard\nwork being recognised.\nNot only is he a tireless\nVice-president and Taekwondo Ambassador but is\nalways looking after our\nclub members.\nBut of course, achieving 2nd\nplace in the UK\noverall ranking and\nbecoming UK Poomsae\nand Indomitable Champions would never have\nbeen possible without all\nend of the day, Taekwondo is not about the belt\nor the medals, but about\nwhat you learn and take\naway from it. For me, that\nis the sense of family in\nour instructors, coaches,\nalumni and members. We\nmight be a small team,\nbut you can be certain that\nwe will grow stronger and\nstronger each year and\nreach new heights.\n\u201cOur fighters\ndid not\ngive up and\nfought until\nthe referee\nannounced\nthe end of the\ngame\u201d\nend of the game. Not\neven technical issues\nstopped us. Just ask Huey\nShan, who had to fight\nher final twice, emerging\nvictorious each time. Nevertheless, she was not the\nonly one to win gold. A\ntotal of three golds, three\nsilvers and four bronzes\nwere achieved in total.\nThese were awarded to:\nSimonne Griffith-Jones,\nSojin Park (A-class) and\nHuey Shan Tey (B-class)\nfor gold; Wenbo Chen\n(A-class), Menghan Liu\n(B-class) and Sharmila\nRana (C-class) for silver;\n\n"

It made me feel\nincredibly uncomforta-ble, and I decided not to\ntalk to him for the rest of\nthe evening.\u201d However,\nthe staff member continued to come up to Susan\nthroughout the night,\ndespite the fact she had\nmade it clear she didn\u2019t\nwant to spend time with\nhim: \u201cHe came up to me\nand started chatting, so\nI just went back inside,\nbut he found me again,\nand commented on my\nbreasts.\u201d\nLater on in the evening,\nwhen the group had\nmoved on to a different\nvenue, Susan and the staff\nmember ended up near\neach other at the bar: \u201cHe\nkept asking me what I\nwanted to drink, over and\nover, so I turned away,\nbecause I just didn\u2019t want\nto speak to him. He asked\n\u2018why won\u2019t you talk to\nme? Why won\u2019t you let\nme buy you a drink?\u2019And\nthen he grabbed my ass.\u201d\nSusan\u2019s experience is\nnot an isolated incident\nwithin higher education:\nan investigation by the\nGuardian, published\naround a year ago, found\nstudents in the UK had\nmade at least 169 allegations of staff sexual misconduct towards students,\nincluding three incidents\nat Imperial. The actual\nnumber of incidents is\nlikely to be much higher;\nDr Ann Olivarius, a senior\npartner at law firm McAllister Olivarius, said these\nresults were \u201cjust the tip\nof the iceberg\u201d, while Dr\nAnna Bull, co-founder of\nthe 1752 Group, which\naims to tackle sexual\nmisconduct in higher\neducation, said: \u201cThere is\nevidence to suggest that\nthe actual figures in the\nUK would be staggering.\u201d\nSusan chose not to\nreport the incident to the\nCollege or the Union,\nciting the pressure such\nproceedings can have:\n\u201cIf something happens to\nhim, if he loses his job,\ndoes that become my\nresponsibility? And then\nall of these proceedings\nare fairly uncomfortable\nto go through. Already\nwhen these kind of things\nhappen you think you\u2019re\nin the wrong, and then\nhaving to explain what\nhappened to someone else\nis just horrible. It\u2019s just\nsuch a difficult thing to\ndo.\u201d\nhigher education. One\nis to \u201cimplement an enforceable national code\nof conduct that clarifies\nprofessional boundaries\u201d:\nthe group says students\nare often \u201cunsure what\nbehaviour is acceptable\u201d\nfrom staff members,\ndue to \u201cblurred lines\naround the professional\nrelationship between staff\nand students.\u201d This is\nsomething Susan found\nin her experience: \u201cAll\nthese things are grey\nareas \u2013 I\u2019ve been to drinks\nfor research groups, and\nthat sort of thing, because\nit\u2019s a work setting, but\nwe need to draw clear\nlines. Even though we are\nboth adults, he\u2019s still in\na position of power over\nstudents, and that kind\nof behaviour \u2013 going out\nwith students \u2013 is wrong.\nBut it\u2019s not advertised as\nbeing wrong \u2013 nowhere at\nImperial.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are assaulted\nat university, then it is a\nuniversity issue. I don\u2019t\nthink I\u2019ve seen anything\nat Imperial saying \u2018if a\nstaff member does this\nyou need to report it\u2019. And\nthat\u2019s quite an astonishing\noversight.\u201d\nThese concerns over\nthe ability to handle sexual\nmisconduct were echoed\nby a number of women\nFelix spoke to, with one\npostdoc saying: \u201cUK universities do not have the\npolicies to be able to cope\nwith [staff-student sexual\nharassment and bullying]\nat the moment \u2013 and that\u2019s\nquite frightening.\u201d\nWhile Susan does not\nhave classes with the man\nwho assaulted her, she\nstill has to see him in the\ndepartment occasionally \u2013\nsomething which greatly\naffects her: \u201cI\u2019ve seen\nhim, and he\u2019s made eye\ncontact with me and said\nhello. I just feel so uncomfortable and nervous, and\nI just don\u2019t want to say\nanything back.\u201d\naffects women disproportionately\u201d. While this\nviolence does not necessarily need to be sexual,\nthe majority of reports\nFelix obtained through the\nsurvey related to sexual\nassault and rape.\nTheactualproportionof\nstudents who have experienced sexual assault may\nwell be higher: one NUS\nreport suggests that one\nin four female students\nacross the UK has been\nsexually assaulted, with\nfar more facing sexual\nharassment. The College,\non its website, says it is\n\u201ccommitted to promoting\na university environment\nwhere everyone feels safe,\nsupported, and respected\u201d,\nwhile ICU\u2019s Safe Space\nPolicy aims to \u201ccreate\nan environment in our\nvenues that all students,\nstaff and visitors feel safe,\nhappy and protected in.\u201d\nUnfortunately, a\nnumber of those who\nfilled in our survey did\nnot feel safe on campus:\n\u201cI have been harassed\nby unknown men whilst\ngoing about my everyday\nlife since puberty,\u201d wrote\none respondent. \u201cIt was\nonly when I arrived at\nImperial that I began to\nface harassment from\nmy peers\u2026 I have been\ntouched, grabbed, and\nmauled without consent.\nI have felt frightened and\nscared of being raped. I\nrarely felt that any of my\nmale peers respected me\nas an equal human being.\u201d\nThe Union building\nseems to be a hotspot for\nsexual violence, particularly at events like ACC\nNight. \u201cIf \u2018gender-based\nviolence\u2019 includes minor\nsexual assault \u2013 slaps\non the bum, that sort of\nthing \u2013 then it\u2019s certainly\nsomething that happens\non a regular night in\nthe Union,\u201d wrote one\nrespondent, while others\nreported being groped in\n568 or sexually harassed\nin Metric. One respondent\nsaid the Union Bar was\nwhere she had experienced the most derogatory\ncomments and the greatest number of threats of\nsexual violence.\nonly 8.7% of respondents\nsaid they would report\na sexual assault to ICU,\nciting concerns about the\nincident being treated as\nminor, or fear they would\nbe blamed or not taken\nseriously.\nSome women who\nhad reported their cases\nsaid they were not satisfied with the results:\none woman, who had\nbeen raped, told Felix:\n\u201cCollege did nothing, nor\ndid the Union. That was\nonly one of a number of\ncases I believe have been\nswept under the carpet.\u201d\nAnother, who was raped\nby another student whilst\nunconscious after a night\nout, said the College\nhad not been helpful: \u201cI\nwas advised that if I was\nunsuccessful with the\npolice that I would have\nto see them on campus\nevery day, and that it\nwould simply make my\nuniversity experience\nmore difficult. Imperial\u2019s\nculture of protecting students\u2019 reputations above\nwellbeing is partially\nresponsible for this.\u201d\nLast term Felix reported\non the experience of one\nalumna who had reported\nher sexual assault to the\nCollege and the Union;\nthe investigation took\nmore than seven months\nto be completed, during\nwhich time the victim was\npassed between at least\nsix staff, and left unsup-ported. \u201cThis experience\npushed me back into a suicidal state,\u201d she told Felix.\n\u201cAbsurdly, the sexual\nassault investigation was\nmore distressing that the\nsexual assault itself.\u201d\nAnother student said\nshe had never reported\nincidents of sexual harassment \u201csimply because\nthere is no clear channel\nto do so\u2026Imperial should\nimplement an easy to use,\nonline sexism and harassment reporting tool\u201d.\nOthers mention that existing services at Imperial\nare not advertised. Susan,\nprior to being assaulted\nby the staff member, had\nbeen sexually assaulted\non campus by a non-Im-perial student, after being\nemotionally manipulated\ninto going to an isolated\narea with him. This time,\nshe reported it to campus\nsecurity: \u201cThey were\nincredible. They took\nme down to their office,\nand made me feel so\ncomfortable. If you are\nassaulted, you are under\nno obligation to report\nit \u2013 you\u2019re so busy trying\nto process what happened,\nthe thought of having to\nexplain it to someone else\nis unthinkable \u2013 but the\nsecurity services were\nfantastic.\u201d\nAfter taking a statement from Susan, security\nphoned the police with\nher consent, and helped\nto make a report. They\nposted the perpetrator\u2019s\nface on the College\u2019s security boards and shortly\nafter he was arrested while\nleading another girl away\nfrom the main campus.\nWith Susan\u2019s consent, the\nsecurity services got in\ntouch with College tutors,\nand helped her organise\nmitigating circumstances.\nShe was also fast-tracked\ninto the College counselling service.\nuniversity campuses, and\nthe College is setting up\na working group to deal\nwith the issue. Professor\nCurry told Felix it would\n\u201clook across the board at\nstaff and student experi-ences, and come up with a\nunified set of policies and\nprocedures that create a\ncredible reporting system,\nso that staff and students\ndon\u2019t feel like there is\nnowhere to go\u201d.\nAs well as the creation\nof a more accessible reporting system, the group\nshould also clarify and\ncodify what behaviours\nare considered acceptable\nfrom academics \u2013 a topic\nProfessor Curry believes\nacademics are becoming\nmore aware of as a result\nof increasing discourse.\nOne of the key challenges the working group\nwill face, Professor Curry\nadmits, is the issue of\ncommunication: \u201cThere\nare gaps, and in a large,\ncomplex organisation\n[like Imperial] there are\nalways going to be gaps,\nor problems with com-munication, which recent\ncases have highlighted.\nOne important thing is to\nmake sure the students\u2019\nunion and the College are\njoined up in a way that\nworks for students.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big job to do,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cand it can\u2019t be dismissed or brushed under\nthe carpet.\u201d\nNames have been\nchanged. If you have\nbeen affected by anything\ndiscussed in this article,\nplease consider phoning\nThe Samaritans(116\n123), Rape Crisis (0808\n802 9999), or Survivors\nUK (020 3598 3898) for\nconfidential support and\nadvice. Students can also\ncontact their Faculty\nSenior Tutors for support,\nor reach out to ICU\u2019s\nAdvice Centre, which\noffers independent, im-partial, and confidential\nadvice.\n\u201cWhile Susan\ndoes not\nhave classes\nwith the staff\nmember who\nassaulted her,\nshe still has to\nsee him in the\ndepartment\u201d\nThe 1752 Group has\na number of strategic\npriorities, implementation of which would go\nsome ways to addressing\nsexual misconduct in\n\u201cSome women\nwho reported\ntheir cases said\nthey had not\nbeen helped\nby the College\nor Union\u201d\nWhen women have\nfaced violence, many do\nnot feel confident about\nreporting it to the College\nor ICU. In a survey\norganised by an Imperial\nstudent earlier this year,\n\u201cOne student\nsaid she had\nnever reported\nsexual\nharassment\nbecause 'there\nis no clear\nchannel to do\nso'\u201d\n\u201cReporting these kind\nof things is one of the\nhardest and most unthinkable things you can\nconsider in that situation.\nHowever, there are services to go to if you know\nwhere they are on campus\n\u2013 I would never have gone\nto the Union with this, but\nsecurity were fantastic. If\nyou can report it, and you\nfeel like you can \u2013 it\u2019s no\nway an obligation \u2013 there\nare things you can do.\u201d\nOne of the reasons\nSusan wanted to share\nher experience was to let\npeople know there were\nplaces they could go to for\nhelp. Our survey found\nthat many respondents\nare unaware of available\nsupport: fewer than half\nof respondents said they\nknew where to go if they\nwere the victim of discrimination or violence,\nwhile only 22% of women\nsurveyed felt that the\nCollege was doing enough\nto provide support for\nvictims of discrimination.\nThe topic of sexual\nmisconduct has become\nmore prominent on\n\u201c8.5% of\nrespondents\nto our survey\nreported\nexperiencing\ngender-based\nviolence\u201d\nSusan is one of the\n8.5% of respondents to\nour survey who reported\nhaving experience of\ngender-based violence \u2013 a\nbroad term defined by\nthe Council of Europe\nConvention on preventing\nand combating violence\nagainst women and\ndomestic violence as\n\u201cviolence that is directed\nagainst a woman because\nshe is a woman, or that\nof respondents agreed Imperial\nCollege London provided enough\nsupport for victims of discrimination\nand harassment\nof respondents had experienced\ngender-based violence\nThe Union building was reported as a hot-spot for sexual violence // Imperial\n\n"

The\nentourage consisted of\nformer President (and\nsuperfan we can\u2019t get to\nleave) Robin De Meyere,\nwho came equipped with\nhis best cheers and lots\nof love and support. He\nsupported the team from\nMelissa\u2019s excessive face\nmask routine the night\nbefore to the moment the\nshield was handed over.\nImperial\u2019s win comes\nfollowing a string of\nincreasing successes for\nthe society. Imperial\u2019s first\nentry into IUPDC came in\n2014, and the society was\nabsolutely wowed by the\nquality of performances\nfrom across the country.\nGradually creeping up the\nleaderboard, we placed 4th\nin 2015, 3rd\nin 2016 and\n2nd\nin 2017, so this year\u2019s\nwin certainly follows the\ntrend! The competitors\nalso managed to score\nsome significant individual wins throughout the\nyear. In London Varsity\n2018, Taylor Lyons\nplaced first in London in\nthe Beginners\u2019 category.\nDonja Karimlou took 2nd\nand 3rd\nplace in South East\nRegionals and Nationals\nrespectively (despite\ncreating a brand new\nroutine for finals in only\ntwo weeks!) Brandon\u2019s 2nd\nplace advanced routine at\nSEUPC was awarded 3rd\nin the country, and lastly\nthe group\u2019s 1st\nplace win\nat regionals continued\nto wow at nationals,\nawarding them 2nd\nnationally and cementing the\ntitle for Imperial.\nIUPDC has been occurring in the UK since\n2011, first hosted in\nCardiff with fewer than 15\nuniversities competing.\nAs the competition grew,\nmore universities wanted\nto take part, leading to\na first-come first-served\nadmittance system which\nleft many universities\nside-lined. Following the\nintroduction of National\nUniversity Pole Association (NUPA) in 2016\nto regulate competition\nrules and judging criteria,\nIUPDC was able to\nbe expanded into four\nregional qualifiers with\nthe top two universities\nin each round heading\nto the finals, massively\nincreasing the number of\nuniversities permitted to\ntake part.\nAs competitions are\nmore spread out, with\nfewer competitors per\nday, the format of the\ncompetition has changed\ndramatically over time:\ncompetitors are able to\npick their own music,\nthere is now only one\nperformer on stage at a\ntime and the number of\npoles each performer can\nuse has also increased.\nDancers are now able to\nuse both spinning and\nstatic poles, and they are\njudged on how evenly\nspread a performance is\nbetween the two poles,\nan analogous criterion to\nprofessional competitions\nlike the aforementioned\nWorld Pole Sport and\nFitness Championships,\nor the GAISF-recognised\nIPSF World Pole Sports\nChampionships.\nAs the championship\ncontinues to progress and\ndevelop with the increasing popularity of pole\nsports, ICU Pole & Aerial\nSociety are extremely\nexcited to be a part of the\nexpanding community\ndeveloped through this\ncompetition. We are also\nextremely proud to be\nannounced winners this\nyear, when pole dance was\nofficially internationally\nrecognised as a sport by\nGAISF, showing our true\ncommitment to the athlet-icism and grace involved\nin this complex art form.\nWe are looking forward to\ncontinuing our tradition of\nattending and competing,\nand are thrilled to be\nawarded this title and the\nhonour of hosting the nine\ntalented finalist universities in IUPDC 2019.\nL-R: Donja Karimlou, Brandon Tsang, Taylor Lyons, Alix Regnier, Robin De Meyere;\nBase: Melissa Lee \u2013 Nationals Winning Team // IC Pole & Aerial\nDonja Karimlou \u2013 Intermediate performance at SEUPC //\nIC pole & aerial\nBrandon Tsang \u2013 Advanced performance at SEUPC // IC\npole & aerial\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1689\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nJapanese literature through the ages\nBooks Writer Pavan Inguva discusses his love for Japanese literature, and introduces two of his favourites.\nBOOKS\nPavan Inguva\nBooks Writer\nI\nhave become quite\npartial to Japanese\nliterature as a literary\ncategory. Most examples share overarching\nsimilarities in aesthetic\nflavour, such as the notion\nof impermanence of\nbeing, which derive from\nboth cultural and religious\ndevelopments throughout\nJapanese history. These\nsensitivities, observable\nin other Japanese art\nforms such as ceramics\nor paintings, result in a\ncharacteristically sublime\nwriting style no matter\nwhen it was written.\nFor example, works by\nChikamatsu Monzaemon,\na 17th\ncentury playwright\nwho wrote canonical\npieces for Bunraku\n(puppet theatre) and\nKabuki (live theatre) still\nretain a certain freshness\nand sophistication if read\ntoday. This is not to say\nthat the authors write in\nthe same style, but rather\nthat the broader aesthetic\nsensibilities and literary\ntraditions lend a certain\nelegance.\nI would recommend\nDonald Keene\u2019s The\nPleasure of Japanese\nLiterature for a more\ncomprehensive review\non the nexus of Japanese\nhistory and aesthetics and\nits impact on literature. A\ncommonality I particularly enjoy is the emphasis\nthat these authors have\nplaced on the self, going to\ngreat lengths to showcase\nthe personal: tensions,\npassions and proclivities.\nI felt this characteristic\nhas made many works\nrelatable, helping me to\ncrystallise and frame raw\nthoughts and feelings.\nModern Japanese\nliterature uniquely\ncombines modernist and/\nor post-modernist themes\nwith the Japanese aesthet-ic, including its perspectives and history, into a\npowerful read. Renowned\nauthors like Natsume\nSoseki and Ryonuske\nAkutgawa are characteristic of pre-WW2 literature,\nincorporating modernist\nthemes and writing styles\nin their prominent works\nsignifying the changing\nzeitgeist.\nNaturalised foreign\nauthors like Lafcaido\nHearn have also gained\nsome prominence, reflecting the increasing\ndiversity that came with\ninternational trade and\nmigration. This period\nalso saw the development\nof Japan\u2019s first Nobel\nlaureate in Literature,\nYasunari Kawabata, who\nreceived the prize in\n1968. Post-war Japanese\nliterature saw several\nother prominent authors\nlike Kobo Abe, Yukio\nMishima, and Kenzaburo\nOe (Japan\u2019s 2nd\nNobel\nlaureate for literature)\nwho started to incorporate contemporary and\npost-modern themes\nand writing styles into a\nJapanese context.\nEven more contemporary authors like Haruki\nMurakami have been producing outstanding pieces\nof work (I quite liked\nHard-Boiled Wonderland\nand the End of the World),\ncontributing to a flourishing literary tradition.\nYasunari Kawabata\u2019s\nBeauty and Sadness\nKawabata edged out\nMishima for the Nobel\nprize in literature in 1968.\nHe is best known for the\nbooks Snow Country,\nThousand Cranes, and\nThe Old Capital amongst\nothers. Much of his work\nskilfully combines the\nintrinsic passions and\nfeelings people have in\nour human (and particularly in our romantic)\nrelationships, with the\ncultural and socio-politi-cal attitudes and tensions\nof the time.\nBeauty and Sadness,\nwhile a nice short read, is\nan excellent representation of Kawabata\u2019s ability\nto capture the nature of a\nromantic passion between\ntwo lovers and the consequent tensions that exist in\nthe self and those around.\nThere are times when\nhis descriptions almost\nenable you to vicariously\nexperience the depths of\nsuch experiences.\nIt follows Otoko,\ncurrently a renowned\npainter and her youthful\nbut life-changing romance\nwith Oki, a much older\nman. Their passionate\naffair resulted in Otoko\nhaving a stillborn child.\nKawabata artistically\nshows the intrinsic\ntensions that we have\nduring the peaks and\ntroughs of romance and\nits failure; the sort of\nromance that transcends\ntime and always lingers\nin the back of your mind,\nmanifesting in every sigh\nand chuckle.\nYukio Mishima\u2019s The\nTemple of the Golden\nPavilion\nMishima to date is\none of my favourite\nKinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion which is the subject of Mishima\u2019s novel// Wikimedia\nauthors. His life story\nis fascinating to say the\nleast and his writing is\nthoroughly enjoyable and\nthought-provoking.\nA key theme present\nin his work is the notion\nof purity and beauty. The\nGolden Pavilion (also\nknown as Kinkaku-ji) is\na famous Zen Buddhist\ntemple in Kyoto dating\nback to the 14th\ncentury.\nMishima presents a fictionalised version of the\n1950 incident when the\ntemple was burnt down by\na young monk.\nWe start with Mishima\noutlining various formative experiences the pro-tagonist, Mizoguchi, has\nas a child. This is where\nthe notion of Kinkaku-ji\nbeing the pinnacle of aesthetic ideals is implanted\ninto him. Following his\nfather\u2019s death, Mizoguchi\nbecomes a novice priest\nat Kinkaku-ji. As the\nstory progresses, we can\nsee how his thoughts\nare shaped by his inner\ntensions and his interactions with a spectrum\nof characters, such as\nKashiwagi (a twisted\nuniversity friend with a\nphilosophical bent) and\nthe temple\u2019s Superior.\nThis results in a sublime\nand nuanced discourse on\nthe nature of beauty and\nhow one interacts with\nthe concept. Mizoguchi\nfound himself impotent\nas the idea of Kinkaku-ji\nseized him. As his thought\nprocess developed, or\narguably as his mental\nillness worsened, the motivation to burn the temple\ndeepened, leading to its\neventual destruction with\nMizoguchi enjoying a cigarette as the temple burns.\nThe entire novel, while\ncomplex in story, remains\naccessible and serves as\nan excellent introduction\nto Mishima\u2019s work and\nJapanese literature as a\ncategory.\n\n"

More\nwomen also felt gender\nimpacted how they were\ntreated by their lecturers\nthan felt the same about\ntheir peers.\nAs with comments\nfrom their peers, the vast\nmajority of instances\nseem to take the form\nof off-the-cuff remarks:\nwomen reported teaching\nassistants saying they\nshould be the one to\nshake up solutions since\nit would \u201chelp me learn\nhow to cuddle my baby in\nthe future\u201d, tutors telling\nwomen in the group\nthey could \u201cdo the easy\nequations\u201d, and demonstrators in computer labs\nsaying \u201ctrust girls to care\nso much about colours\u201d\nwhen female undergraduates were picking out\nwires. Students reported\nfeeling uncomfortable\nabout these comments,\nbut being reluctant to call\nthem out lest they be seen\nas \u201chumourless\u201d.\nA number of women at\nImperial also reported not\nhaving access to the same\nteaching opportunities as\ntheir male peers. \u201cI\u2019ve had\nconsultants preferentially\nteach the males in the\nhospital group, and sometimes ignored questions\nfrom me and my female\ncolleagues,\u201d wrote one\nmedical student, while\nanother said she was not\nallowed into surgery by\nher consultant since she\n\u201cwould make a great GP\u201d.\nShe was told to do work\non the ward instead, while\nmales in her group attended surgery.\nOther women reported\nassumptions about their\nfuture life choices being\nused to convince them\nnot to pursue careers in\nresearch. Frequently,\nrespondents to the survey\ntold Felix about times\nwhen they\u2019d been told\nnot to go into academia\nor other high-intensity\ncareers because they\nwould soon be having\nchildren, and \u201cwould\nnot be able to balance\nchildcare with work\u201d.\nOne medical student was\ntold \u201cthere was no point\nin pursuing a high-flying\nresearch career, because\nI would soon get married,\nfall pregnant, and leave\nthe profession\u201d. This\ncomment came from \u201ca\nman hired to be a pastoral\nguide for female and male\nstudents, with power over\ntheir careers in terms of\nreferences.\u201d\nAnother respondent reported frequent incidents\nof women being told to\ngo into \u201cteaching and jobs\nrequiring empathy, like\nnursing\u201d, even when they\nclearly expressed their\nintention to pursue a PhD,\nand had achieved top\ngrades throughout their\ntime at Imperial.\nA 2014 report from the\ngovernment\u2019s Science and\nTechnology Committee\nidentified that only 17%\nof STEM professors were\nwomen, and that \u2013 while\nthere was \u201cno single\nexplanation for the lack\nof gender diversity\u201d \u2013 \u201cit\nis the result of perceptions\nand biases combined with\nthe impracticalities of\ncombining a career with a\nfamily\u201d. The report found\nthat the early period of\nacademic STEM careers\nwas characterised by a\nlack of job security, and \u2013\nsince this period coincides\nwith a time when many\nbegin to think about starting families \u2013 there was\na high attrition rate as a\nresult.\nProfessor Curry believes this attrition rate\ncan have a knock-on\neffect for women at the\nundergraduate level:\n\u201cMost of the time, the\nperson standing at the\nfront of the lecture theatre\nis a man, so a young\nwoman coming in to do\na science or engineering\ndegree thinking \u2018what are\nmy chances in this field?\u2019,\nthe rational assessment is\nthat your chances are less\nthan those of a man.\u201d\nAs these women progress through the ranks\nof academia, as well as\nfacing barriers from their\nsuperiors or those allocating grant funding, they\nwill often face challenges\nfrom below, as students\ngive them much more\nhostile feedback.\n\u201cStudent feedback is\nincredibly biased against\nwomen,\u201d one postdoc\nresearcher reports. \u201cEven\nif two academics deliver\nsimilar lectures and the\noutcomes for the students\nis the same, the feedback\nabout a woman will be\nhostile and negative,\nwhereas about men it\nwill be pretty average.\u201d\nShe points to a study into\nstudent evaluations of\nteaching (SET) \u2013 surveys\nlike Imperial\u2019s SOLE,\nupon which universities\noften base promotion or\nfiring of lecturers \u2013 which\nshows students regularly\nrate women lower than\nmen. Such evaluations\nhave become increasingly\nimportant in the higher education landscape as they\nhelp form judgements in\nthe Teaching Excellence\nFramework \u2013 a rating\nsystem for universities\nwhich revealed its first set\nof results last year.\nAs well as the amount\nof scrutiny received,\nfemale academics will\noften be described in\nnegative terms compared\nto men. A couple of years\nago, Dr Ben Schmidt,\nan assistant professor\nof history in the USA,\nscraped descriptive data\nfrom 14 million reviews\non RateMyProfessor.com,\nand compared what kind\nof adjectives were used to\ndescribe men and women.\nWords like \u2018funny\u2019,\n\u2018cool\u2019, and \u2018brilliant\u2019 were\nmore likely to be used\nto describe men, while\nwomen were more likely\nto be called \u2018harsh\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019, and \u2018aggressive\u2019.\nLanguage can get quite\nvitriolic. One respondent\ntold Felix: \u201cMy peers will\nfrequently call female lecturers things like \u2018bitch\u2019\nbehind their back if work\nis returned late, but their\nmale counterparts are\nnot subject to anywhere\nnear the same level of\nabuse.\u201d Another student\nsaid: \u201cOne student was\nrejected at an interview\nby a woman, and started\nloudly saying unrepeatable things in the computer\nroom about her on the\nbasis of her gender.\u201d\nA first-year student\nfrom the Faculty of Engineering, spoke about her\nexperience: \u201cAfter our\nfirst term we had SOLE\nfeedback, and this divide\nwas evident. It was also\nthere in our course group\nchats. If a man teaches\npoorly, they don\u2019t really\nsay too many negative\nthings, but if a woman\nteaches something poorly,\nthey\u2019ll just relentlessly\ncall her stuff like \u2018bitch\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cMy peers,\u201d she said,\n\u201care much less kind\ntowards female lecturers.\u201d\n\u201cFemale\nacademics\nwill often be\ndescribed\nin hostile\nterms when\ncompared to\nmen\u201d\nHow can we improve inclusion across sports clubs?\nNEWS\nDespite a welcoming\nenvironment, a\nnumber of students\ndon't feel sports teams\nare treated equally.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nI\nn 2015, Women\u2019s\nRugby were scheduled to play out\nVarsity, having been\nassigned the Headline\nMatch, However, after\ncoaches left earlier than\nscheduled, the stands\nemptied while the match\nwas in progress, and the\nteam was left stranded at\nthe stadium, despite previous assurances from\nSport Imperial that this\nwould not happen. The\nwomen\u2019s team had also\nbeen promised dinner\nand drinks following\nthe match, but arrived to\nfind the men\u2019s team had\nbeen fed, and were asked\nto leave the facilities.\nBy the time the women\narrived, most of the food\nwas eaten, and the remainder was cold. Some\nteam members also\nreported receiving abuse\nfrom a Sport Imperial\nemployee, while one\nplayer told Felix that, as\nthey were ushered onto\nthe last coaches, \u201cdrunk\nmale rugby players\u2026\nwere shouting how they\nwere waiting for \u2018those\nlesbians\u2019.\u201d\nFollowing complaints\nfrom the Women\u2019s Rugby\nClub, an investigation was\nlaunched by the College,\nwhich upheld the majority\nof the claims, but found\n\u201cno evidence\u201d for sexist\nor misogynistic language\nused by staff (members of\nthe club maintain sexist\nlanguage was used).\nProfessor Debra Humphris, then-Vice Provost\n(Education), said: \u201cAs an\ninstitution that strives for\nexcellence, we must take\na leading role in moving\ntowards a more mutually\nrespectful community.\u201d\nThree years on, and\nwith another women\u2019s\nteam headlining Varsity,\nhave things changed?\nWhile fewer students\nhad experienced misogyny as part of their Club,\nSociety, or Project (CSP)\nthan within the academic\nsphere, over a quarter of\nthe women surveyed said\nthey had faced sexism. Of\nthese, the vast majority\nwere those involved with\nsports teams. In general,\nstudents were less likely\nto have experienced discrimination from fellow\nCSP members (21% of respondents had), but were\nmuch more likely to have\nfaced it from members\nof other CSPs (36% of\nrespondents).\nA number of respondents reported clubs\nparticipating in sexist\nbehaviour, particularly\nobjectification of women.\nOne student told Felix:\n\u201cI have been in multiple\nsports clubs over the\nyears, and am a fan of\nsports night. However,\none game has particularly\nstuck in my mind. It was\nplayed by a male club,\nwho would announce\nthe name of a woman on\ntheir club\u2019s other table,\nand then count up to ten.\nThe male members of\nthe club would put their\nhand down when they\nthought they had reached\nthe appropriate rating for\nthat girl. This was all in\nearshot of the girls they\nwere rating.\u201d\nOther women reported\nsports teams \u201creferring to\nUnion \u2018pussy\u2019 as \u2018cold\u2019\u201d,\nwhile another said \u201cIt\nwould be nice to see\nwomen promoted more in\nsport, and not put down or\nharassed by men.\u201d\nThe organisation of\nsports teams at Imperial,\nand in particular the\nresources different clubs\nreceive, was also a source\nof discontent for women\nin sports. In total, about\n30% of respondents\nagreed with the statement\n\u201cSport Imperial (the\nCollege\u2019s sporting body)\nensure all sports teams are\ntreated equally\u201d, while the\nsame number disagreed,\nand the majority were un-decided. However, when\nrespondents not involved\nwith sports teams were\nremoved, the majority of\nstudents felt Sport Imperial did not treat teams\nequally, with only 12% of\nwomen agreeing they did.\nWhile some of this\ndiscrepancy could be explained by the fact men\u2019s\nand women\u2019s teams may\nbe in differently classed\ndivisions, a number of\nstudents said they felt\nwomen\u2019s clubs were not\nprovided with as much\nsupport. \u201cEven though the\ntwo teams [of my sport]\nare in the same division,\u201d\none student told Felix,\n\u201cmost people seem to\nbelieve the men\u2019s team is\nmore important. They get\nbetter training slots, and\nmuch more funding for\ncoaching.\u201d\nAnother club member\nsaid: \u201cOur club has had to\nstruggle to be taken seriously and included in Imperial activities, whereas\nour male counterpart is\none of the most respected\nclubs. I believe it is only\nthrough them helping us\nthat we have been taken\nseriously.\u201d\nEmma*, a member of\na women\u2019s sporting team,\ntold Felix: \u201cI think Sport\nImperial has a completely\ndifferent set of goals and\nvalues to what can be expected of a sports coordi-nator. Their primary focus\nis branding and \u2018value\nadded\u2019 to the College\nreputation, as opposed\nto engaging as many\npeople as possible. It is\nnot acknowledged that\nwomen\u2019s sports are more\nlikely to recruit beginners,\nand therefore need more\nsupport and coaching\nto be able to safely play\nthese sports.\u201d\nShe went on to say\nthe higher membership\nnumbers for men\u2019s clubs\nmeant they got preferential allocation for training\nspace; some women\u2019s\nsports teams train until\n11pm on weekday nights,\nmeaning members\ndidn\u2019t get home until\npast midnight. She also\nhighlighted that increased\ncentralisation of sport ser-vices, combined with the\nfact many women sports\nplayers are spread across\ncampuses, has meant\nfemale students are more\nlikely to be involved with\nsport at a local level.\nEmma also raised\nconcerns about current\npromotion of women in\nsport, saying Imperial\nGirls Can week was \u201ca\nparticularly sore spot\nfor everyone I know\u201d:\n\u201cPatronising \u2018calorie\nburning\u2019 spin classes,\nturning up and giving out\npink t-shirts at our regular\nBUCS fixtures\u2026 when\nreally members of our\ncommittee are buying kit\nand equipment out of their\nown pocket, organising\nthe referees, and coaching\nthe team themselves with\nno payment or training \u2013 it\ntasted particularly bitter.\u201d\nIn a statement for Felix\na College spokesperson\nsaid: \"Sport Imperial is\ncommitted to encouraging\nparticipation from all\nstudents. We know that\nwomen can face barriers\nin participating in sport,\nthat\u2019s why we work to\nchallenge perceptions,\ncelebrate women\u2019s sport,\nand create an environment\nwhere everyone feels\ncomfortable.\"\n\"It is not the case that\nSport Imperial gives preferential funding to male\nteams. Sport Imperial\nfunding is allocated to\nclubs according to where\ntheir highest ranked team\nsits within BUCS \u2013 this\ncould be a men\u2019s or\nwomen\u2019s team. The club\nitself then makes the\ndecision as to how this\nfunding is distributed,\nand to which teams.\nFor sports that are not\nincluded in BUCS, clubs\ncan apply for funding\nwhich is allocated based\non the developmental and\ncompetition requirements.\nSport Imperial applies an\nobjective process with\nequal opportunities for\nboth men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nclubs and teams.\"\nAgree \u2013 62% Disagree \u2013 28%\nNeither \u2013 10%\n\u201cMy gender makes no difference to\nhow I am treated by my supervisors\u201d\nAgree \u2013 55% Disagree \u2013 30%\nNeither \u2013 15%\n\u201cImperial College London work hard\nto make things more inclusive\u201d\nof respondents had experienced staff\nmaking derogatory comments\nA number of respondents felt women's sports teams weren't valued // Veronika\n\u0160igutov\u00e1/@werika\n\n"

He told Felix there\nwere a number of aspects\nthat led to the creation of\nhis role, which partially\ndeveloped out of the position of Provost\u2019s Envoy\nfor Gender Equality:\nchanges within society\nthat have put inclusion\non the agenda; increased\nawareness of the harassment in higher education;\na greater appreciation\nof the mental health of\nstudents and staff; and\nreflection on Imperial\u2019s\nInstitutional Culture\nReport (ICR).\nThe ICR, published\nin December 2016, was\ntriggered by a number of\nsexist incidents at Imperial, and said the College\nhad a \u201csink-or-swim\u201d\nculture.

Yet under\nthe surface the two stories\nhave much in common\n\u2013 most prominently\nthat the psychological\naspect of violence can be\nevery bit as damaging as\nthe physical. You Were\nNever Really Here is one\nof our most surprising\naction-thrillers of recent\nyears: mostly quiet and\nrestrained, tension builds\nuntil suddenly exploding\ninto a pulsating blast of\nsound and fury.\nThe main character is\nJoe (Joaquin Phoenix), an\naging PI whose principle\ninvestigative technique\nis violence. He seems\nto specialise in tracking\ndown kidnapped children,\nthough his predilection\nfor ball-peen hammers\nsuggests his clientele is\nthe sort who want rough\njustice. The film does\nfeature a strong supporting cast, including Judith\nRoberts as Joe\u2019s mother,\nJohn Doman as his boss\n,and Ekaterina Samsonov\nas a girl kidnapped and\nforced into prostitution;\nall of them exist to a\ngreater or lesser extent at\nthe periphery with little\nscreen-time and fewer\nlines. You Were Never\nReally Here is most truly\na concerto for a solo actor,\nand Phoenix excels as the\nsoloist. Joe comes with\n\u201cThe film is\nmost truly a\nconcerto for a\nsolo actor, and\nPhoenix excels\nas the soloist\u201d\n\u201cUltimately,\nthe film is\nmore of a\ncharacter\nstudy than a\nstraight up\nthriller\u201d\nall the usual trappings\n\u2013 a painkiller addiction,\nPTSD from a military\ncareer long past and a\nchildhood mutilated by\nan abusive father. Yet the\ncontrol and embodiment\nthat Phoenix brings to the\ncharacterisstaggering.It\u2019s\nnigh impossible to believe\nthat this is the same man\nwho played Commodus\nin Gladiator or Freddie\nQuell in The Master.\nThis is made all the more\nimpressive given how\nspare the script is: mostly\nhe acts solely through his\nhaggard face and weighty\nbody language. The score,\nby Jonny Greenwood\nof Radiohead fame,\nreinforces this sense of\nconcerto with a bifurcated structure. Using\nextended periods of either\nsilence or a pulsating and\nviolent soundtrack, the\nfilm can either let you\nstay relatively relaxed or\nclench you in tightly as it\nramps up the tension. This\nmasterfully controls the\nmood, and Ramsay has an\nexacting power over your\nemotional response as a\nviewer.\nYou Were Never Really\nHere wears its influences\nlightly but deeply. It is so\noriginal and distinct yet\nbears the hallmarks of a\nwide variety of films and\nfilm movements. It is most\ndefinitely a noir: filled\nwith pessimism, violence\nand a pulpy plot. Yet it\nlacks the heightened sense\nthat defines most noirs\nfrom Double Indemnity\nto L.A. Confidential. This\nrealistic tone framing a\nrather extraordinary plot\nmirrors another film that\nYou Were Never Really\nHere consciously apes \u2013\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi\nDriver. Both films share a\nprotagonist who struggles\nto fit into society, who fail\nto find meaning in their\nlives, and whose violence\nreflects their inner turmoil.\nBut these two broken men\nare broken in different\nways. Travis Bickle is\nthe more detached; he\nwill try anything to define\nhimself, though can only\nunderstand the languages\nof violence and sex. It is\nmere happenstance that\nhe ends up acclaimed for\nkilling a pimp \u2013 he could\nhave murdered the Presidential candidate instead.\nJoe, however, feels like\nhe was once functional\nbefore washing up in his\ncurrent wrecked state \u2013 an\noxymoronic mixture of\nrage, fear, and apathy. He\ndoes not seek validation\nfrom others, their desires\nmerely act as a loose\nframework shaping his\nactions. Indeed, whilst\nBickle seems unafraid\nof death, Joe is haunted\nby suicidal thoughts and\nit is only those that rely\non him who break him\nout of his apathetic bent,\ndriving him forwards. You\nWere Never Really Here\u2019s\nother strong influence is\nthe horror genre. Psycho\nis aptly referred to \u2013 both\nfilms ramp up the sense of\ndread and then suddenly\nexplode into violence.\nRamsay also visually\nquotes The Shining \u2013 an\nathematic reminder of the\nself-destructive capabilities of powerful men.\nUltimately, You Were\nNever Really Here is\nmore of a character study\nthan a straight up thriller.\nIt is more interested in\nhow Joe reacts at every\nmoment, rather than the\nimplications of his actions\nas they ripple through the\nwider world. If you are\nprepared to accept the film\nand its preoccupations on\nits own terms then you\nwill find an engaging and\nthoughtful film, utterly\nunlike anything else in\ncinemas.\nWho filled their water gun with tomato juice?// Amazon Studios\nFILM\nLawrence Good\nFilm Writer\nDir: Lynne Ramsay.

So, Easter for\nme is more a holiday of\nsweets \u2013 especially Easter\neggs. In my opinion, the\nonly things that should be\ncooked during Easter have\nto have chocolate. Even\nif you have no idea what\nto make for Easter, you\ncan always have everyday\nfood and then impress\neveryone with some great\nchocolate detailing. I\ntotally recommend getting\nsome Easter eggs to share\nwith your friends or, if\nyou have some time, cook\nsome simple chocolate\ncake \u2013 but more about that\nanother time, really.\nANDRADA\u2019S GUIDE TO THE BEST EASTER EGGS\nFOOD\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\n\u201cIn my\nopinion, the\nonly things\nthat should\nbe cooked\nover Easter\nneed to have\nchocolate!\u201d\nI am aware that there are\nhundreds of versions of\nchocolate eggs out there,\nbut luckily for you, I\u2019ve\nbeen testing the market\nfor some years now and\nI have a pretty good idea\nabout what is worth it and\nwhat is not.\nGodiva Treasure Egg\nThis is my all-time favourite Easter egg with absolutely no doubt! I cannot imagine\nsomething better, simply because my favourite chocolate is Godiva chocolate. The\negg is big enough to stockpile you with chocolate for almost a week, and when you\nfinish it\u2026 there are more small chocolates inside waiting for you! And just in case you\nget bored by the Belgian milk chocolate, the inside pieces are different: while some\nof them will return you to your childhood, others will make you feel like you are a\nresponsible adult at a fancy party.\nVenchi Nougatine Easter Egg\nAnd the bronze goes to\u2026. I am trying to create some suspense for nothing here as\nyou\u2019ve probably read the name already. This egg is 56% dark chocolate with crunchy\ncaramelised hazelnuts. I think that the best bit about it is the advertising:\u201ccomes with\na useful surprise for your car/house\u201d. I seriously thought that it is the awesome tin\nthat will provide a useful storage space \u2013 am I turning into grandma? But, it\u2019s actually\na keychain! Oops, sorry for ruining the surprise. Anyway, do not buy the egg for the\nkeychain alone \u2013 the chocolate is absolutely amazing!\nYes, the name does it justice! This chocolate egg is the size of an ostrich egg \u2013 to\nbe fair, they claim this, and I haven\u2019t checked, but it looks legit enough to me \u2013 and\nit\u2019s delicious. I would like to say that it is as delicious as an ostrich egg, but\u2026I cannot\nconfirm, sorry. In case someone else wants to check, you are more than welcome to.\nNow, I normally eat a lot of chocolate \u2013 I mean A LOT of chocolate \u2013 but this is more\nthan even I can handle. Especially because, this comes with more than just the egg \u2013\nit also has 27 pieces of chocolate and some mini-eggs.\nHotel Chocolate Ostrich Egg\nI think that this egg\u2019s name is slightly misleading as it is not a Colossal Egg, but\nrather a matrioshka egg that ends up with a colossal egg! And the best part about the\nfive eggs is that they all have different tastes (I hope). So far I\u2019ve been through milk\nchocolate and salted honeycomb, dark chocolate orange, and the white chocolate\nwith strawberry and black pepper. Yes, all of them are absolutely great and yes, I am\nprobably eating too much chocolate, but that white chocolate with strawberry and\nblack pepper\u2026. I hope that the remaining two eggs will be at least as good. If you\nwant to have a decadent chocolate party with your best friends, this is the choice!\nFortnum and Mason Colossal Egg\nmore chocolate!\nCANNOT-HAVE-TOO-MUCH-CHOCOLATE MARTINI\nYou will need...\n\u2022 50 g chocolate (any\ncooking chocolate\nif fine, but I recommend using your\nfavourite brand of\nchocolate)\n\u2022 1 tsp honey\n\u2022 25 ml cr\u00e8me de\ncacao\n\u2022 25 ml Baileys\n\u2022 50 ml vodka\n\u2022 Ice\nI know you know where this is going, but still.\u2026\n1. Pour the cr\u00e8me de cacao, the Baileys and vodka, some crushed ice into a\ncocktail shaker and shake.\n2. Strain into a glass\n3. Add the crushed chocolate on top \u2013\nor, if you feel like experimenting, add in\ninto the mixture.\nI know this is an unexpected member of this\nlist, but I wanted to show you a super-quick and\ndelicious way of recycling your leftover chocolate and I also wanted to show you that you\ncan enjoy your favourite ingredient \u2013 chocolate\n\u2013 and your favourite pastime \u2013 alcohol \u2013 at the\nsame time. And since this a chocolate themed\nissue, here we go!\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors,\nillustrators, reporters, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our\nteam.

    "content": "GAMES\nFRIDAY, 16TH\nMARCH, 2018 FELIX\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nIn defence of video game walkthroughs\nGAMES\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nW\nith the\nadvent of\nvideo games\nand the internet also came the onset\nof walkthroughs, guides\nwhich tell you how to play\na game and get through\nthe story. They can vary in\ncomplexity, from telling\nyou only the main points\nof what to do, to literally\nspelling out how to cover\nevery little corner. This is\nsomething which pisses\noff a lot of gamers and is\na source of endless debate\nand discussion.\nIn their defence, people\nwho hate walkthroughs\nare coming from an understandable place. The point\nof a game is to immerse\nyourself in another world.\nYou get involved in a\nstory, learn to master the\ncontrols and gameplay\nand in turn, get to experience the joy of working\nthings out and finding\ninteresting discoveries by\nyourself. Easter eggs can\nbe considered as nice little\nrewards for the hardcore\ngamers who go all out and\ntry and get everything they\ncan out of a game. They\nmay feel like it\u2019s something they\u2019ve earned for\ngetting so invested in the\ngame. When other people\nessentially use a manual\nand get those trinkets for\nhardly any work, it can\nseem like the other people\ndidn\u2019t really \u201cdeserve\u201d the\nprize by comparison.\nComplicating the issue\nis that games, unlike other\nforms of non-interactive\nmedia, require the player\nto act in certain ways in\norder to proceed through\nthe experience. When\nyou listen to a song, all\nyou have to do is listen;\nonly the music actually\nstopping will affect your\nability to listen to it. A\nvideo game, however,\nonly really progresses in\nthe way you\u2019re able to\nplay it.\nIn addition to this,\npeople play games for all\nkinds of reasons and to\nsome, I\u2019m sure, playing a\ngame in any way besides\n\u201coptimally\u201d feels like a\nwaste of time. There are\nplenty of games that have\n\u201cmiss-ables\u201d, which are\nlengthy game just to hit\na few more side quests or\nrecruit certain characters.\nWhile there are some\nnotable exceptions, not\ndoing them shouldn\u2019t\nmake it seem like your\nplay-through was an \u201cincomplete\u201d experience.\nThe biggest reason as to\nwhy people resort to using\ngame guides are because\nof the time investment\ngames require. Most of\nus aren\u2019t teenagers with\nall the time in the world.\nAs we get older and go\nfurther through life, we\nget more commitments;\nas students, we have\nreports, problems sheets\nand assignments to catch\nup amongst other things.\nAs can be expected, this\nmeans there are fewer\nand fewer opportunities to\nplay games.\nSome games are also\nlong, complex and require\nhours of investment to\nget through. While this is\narguablypartofthefunand\nexperience, some people\nget more enjoyment from\nactually doing something\nthan wandering around\naimlessly and hoping that\nthey stumble on the way\nforward. That\u2019s just how\nsome games are designed;\ngiven that, it\u2019s no wonder\npeople use walkthroughts\nto speed things along. For\nother people, using walk-throughs is just another\nway to get through their\nSteam library as fast as\nthey can. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\npersonally guilty of doing,\nI blame all the great value\nSteam sales that just keep\non coming.\nOf course, walk-throughs aren\u2019t the only\nway to get out if you get\nstuck. A simple set of\nactions like pausing the\ngame, doubling back a\nlittle and working your\nway through can be more\nproductive than you might\nthink. And sometimes,\nall you need to do is to\nturn off the game, sleep\non it, and come back to\nthe problem with a fresh\nmind.\nAt the end of the day,\nI\u2019d say that as a player,\nyou should simply engage\nin some introspection\nabout how you personally\nexperience things, about\nhow your brain digests\nexperiences, and then\ndecide from there how\nplaying certain games\nwould best suit your\ntastes. Because honestly,\nwhile it may seem like\nthere\u2019s only one way to\nplay a game, such as going\nin blind and learning\nthings for yourselves, you\nshould ultimately do what\nseems the best for you.\nWe all just want to get the\nbest possible gaming experience from each game.\nSure some people may\ndenounce walkthroughs,\nbut at the end of the day,\nthey just help people\nenjoy and get through the\ngame in their own way.\nAnd as long as everyone\nis having fun, who are we\nto really complain.\nWalkthroughsgetalotofbadreputationfromthepeoplewhodon\u2019tusethem,howeverthisisuncalledforasthey\nprovide a benefit to those who use them.\nDual screens are the only way to multitask // Flickr/ Travis Rigel Lukas Hornung\nsometimes designed so\na new player would only\nknow about them if they\nhad actually read or heard\nabout it beforehand.

A\nquarter of the women\nwho responded also said\nthey had experienced\nbullying or harassment\ndue to their gender.\nThe vast majority of\nthese experiences, based\non reports obtained\nthrough the survey, were\nderogatory comments\nfrom the individual\u2019s\nown peer group: over\n75% of women said they\nhad experienced peers\nmaking such comments\nduring their time at\nImperial, the majority of\nwhich involved sexual-ised language or belittling\ncomments about their\nability.\nOne student told Felix:\n\u201cI can\u2019t even begin to\ncount the number of times\nderogatory comments\nhave been made about\nmyself and other female\nstudents. The constant\nobjectification, judgement\nof our clothes and actions,\nand being constantly\nreferred to as bitches,\nsluts, or whores\u2026 every\ntime I call out a man on\ntheir use of derogatory\nlanguage they laugh it off\nas harmless.\u201d\nOther students were\naccused of swapping\nsexual favours in exchange for good grades:\none women was asked\nwhether she was sleeping\nwith a teaching assistant\nto get a good mark on her\nreport, while another told\nFelix: \u201cI was told I must\nhave given the assessor\na handjob under the desk\nbecause I did better than a\nmale peer in a viva assessment.\u201d\nMany said they found it\ndifficult to call out sexist\nlanguage, with a number\nof women saying they\nwere called \u201cover-sensitive\u201d or accused of \u201coverreacting\u201d when they challenged such comments.\nThree-fifths of the women\nsurveyed said they had\nexperienced derogatory\ncomments about women\nbeing left unchallenged.\nProfessor Curry\nadmits it is \u201cimpossible\nfor College to police\nevery single interaction\nthat happens between\nstudents\u201d, but says \u201cevery\nmember of the College\ncommunity has a responsibility for appropriate\nbehaviour on campus\u201d.\nOne intervention he\nfeels can lead to tangible\nchange is the introduction\nof Active Bystander\nTraining, which has been\nrolled out to a number of\ndepartments, and some\nkey volunteers within\nICU. The training, which\nteaches people to confront\ndiscriminatory behaviour,\n\u201cis quite an effective way\nto start a conversation, to\nmake sure more people\nare primed and equipped\n[to call out sexism]\u201d.\nHe also highlighted the\nimportance of codifying\nstandards of behaviour\nfrom a student\u2019s first day\nat Imperial: \u201cWe have\nto send out a very clear\nmessage at the beginning,\nsaying we expect these\nstandards of behaviour. In\nour Department [of Life\nSciences] we have introduced lectures for freshers\ntalking about respect, the\nEquality Act, what harassment means. It\u2019s about\ntrying to build a culture\nwhere it doesn\u2019t matter\nwho you are, you\u2019re\nwelcome here, and you\u2019ll\nbe treated with respect.\nKatie*, a final year\nstudent in the Faculty of\nEngineering, told Felix\nshe\u2019d experienced sexism\nsince arriving as a fresher:\n\u201cSince coming to Imperial, I\u2019ve always felt an\nundercurrent of sexism.\nIt started in first year,\nwalking past a male sports\nteam at sports night \u2013 I was\ncatcalled and looked up\nand down so fiercely that I\nfelt exposed. This became\na regular occurrence at\nalmost every sports night.\nCasual sexism disguised\nas jokes and \u2018lad banter\u2019\nhas always been rife, so\nmuch so that even the\nwomen here have accepted and often go along with\nit \u2013 including myself as a\nna\u00efve fresher, wanting to\nfit in.\u201d\nKatie also highlighted\nthe difficulty in speaking\nout, but said it could also\nbe due to intimidation\nwomen on campus feel.\nShe described a number of\nincidents within the Royal\nSchool of Mines (RSM),\nincluding slut-shaming,\nderogatory chanting, and\nsexist behaviour by the\n\u2018Chaps Club\u2019 \u2013 one of\nImperial\u2019s \u2018Tie Clubs\u2019,\nwhich serves as a society\nfor current and former\nmembers of Royal School\nof Mines Union (RSMU).\n\u201cWe were told not to\ncomplain about sexist\ncomments to ICU, since\nit would make our department \u2018look bad\u2019, and\nwhen one of my friends\nwanted to make a complaint about the Chaps we\nwere told we had to take it\nup directly with them. It\u2019s\nintimidating for a woman\nto speak to a large group\nof older men about their\nbehaviour, and so she did\nnot make the complaint.\nIt\u2019s hard as a woman to\nspeak out about sexism\nthrough fear of becoming\nisolated, or receiving a\nbacklash from peers for\nmaking a complaint\u201d.\nRobert Tomkies, the\ncurrent RSMU President\nand ICU's President-elect,\nis aware of the challenges\nfaced by women within\nthe RSMU. He told Felix:\n\u201cIn the RSMU this year\nwe have placed gender\nequality and inclusivity at\nthe forefront of our priorities.\u201d RSMU has identified a number of outdated\ntraditions and sought to\nchange them: a number\nof the old chants were\nretired, and new chants\nselected in the run-up to\nthis year\u2019s Bottle Match;\npeople singing the old\nchants were identified and\ntold to stop. Tomkies also\ncited a number of other\nconcerning traditions that\nhad been identified, such\nas the \u201cPresident\u2019s Yard\u2019,\nwhich was previously\ndone on stage in under-wear, and has since been\nremoved.\nRegarding problems\nstudents had with coming\nforward, RSMU put in\nplace anonymous surveys\nat the beginning of this\nacademic year asking for\nfeedback, and has since\nestablished an online incident form, where students\ncan submit reports. They\nhave secured funding for\nactive bystander training\nfor all key volunteers\nwithin the RSMU \u2013 including sports captains\n\u2013 and are looking into\nways to prevent sexist individuals from attending\nRSMU events.\nTomkies told Felix:\n\u201cTackling these issues\nwill take a continued drive\nfrom the RSMU over\nseveral years, but this\nyear\u2019s committee is proud\nto have been part of those\nsteps. Culture change\ncannot happen overnight,\nbut RSMU has started a\nchange that lays strong\nfoundations for greater\ninclusivity in the future.\u201d\nA representative of\nICU told Felix: \u201cThese\nfigures are very concern-ing. Misogynistic and\ndiscriminatory behaviour\nis simply not acceptable\nin any form to Imperial\nCollege Union, and that\napplies equally to all of\nour social spaces, student\nactivities and events. We\nhave trained our staff and\nstudent leaders in how to\nbe \u2018active bystanders\u2019 and\nour professional staff deal\nswiftly with any incidents\nthat take place within our\nbars and events.\nWe are working with\nCollege on the response\nto the Institutional Culture\nReview, and we acknowledge that we have work\nto do ourselves, to make\nclear to our members\nand volunteers that such\nbehaviour is not welcome\nwithin the Imperial\nCollege Union community\u201d\nWomen in STEM\nAnother significant\ntheme that emerged from\nthe survey was hostility\nfaced by female students\nwho were often told\nthey should not be at\nImperial. Overall, 38%\nof women had been told\nthey couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t\ndo STEM subjects, with\nmany students reporting\nbeing told they did not\ndeserve to be there.\nAs well as comments\nabout natural abilities\n\u2013 \u201cwomen shouldn\u2019t do\nengineering\u201d, \u201cwomen\naren\u2019t as good as men at\nhard sciences\u201d \u2013 women\nreported being told positive discrimination or the\nuse of quotas had made\ntheir time at university\neasier. \u201cYou only got an\noffer because you\u2019re a\ngirl\u201d, was one comment\nreported in the survey,\nwhile \u201ccompanies only\nhire female engineers to\nfill a quota\u201d was another.\nSerena*, a fresher\nin the Faculty of Engineering, reported similar\nexperiences, saying she\nfelt more pressure to do\nwell at her subject as a\nresult: \u201cIf a guy fails, they\nfail because they\u2019ve not\nstudied hard enough, but\nif a woman fails, it\u2019s seen\nas being because she\u2019s a\nwoman. The reasoning\ncompletely changes.\u201d\nOne aspect of Imperial\nlife that can increase\nthe visibility of women\nstudents is the infamous\n\u2018Imperial ratio\u2019 \u2013 used to\ndescribe the relative lack\nof female undergraduates\ncompared to their male\ncounterparts. This year,\nmen made up over two\nthirds of the total cohort,\nwith 730 male applicants\nplaced, compared to 335\nwomen, giving a ratio\nof roughly 70:30 men to\nwomen. This figure varies\ngreatly between departments and years.\nWhile some respondents described such\nlanguage as \u201cbanter\u201d,\nothers highlighted the\nimpact it can have. \u201cIt\nmakes me feel like I\nshouldn\u2019t be there\u201d, said\none student, while another\nsaid it \u201cencourages the\ncontinuation of a mindset,\neven if it\u2019s claimed in\njest\u201d. Some respondents\nsaid such comments had\na cumulative impact on\nthem during their time at\nImperial: \u201cI\u2019m treated as\nless deserving of the job\nbecause I am a woman,\u201d\none said. \u201cIt tends not to\nbe major, but just consistently every day \u2013 it chips\nyou down.\u201d\nSerena talked to Felix\nabout her experience:\n\u201cI think the biggest\nissue with misogyny is\nwith my peers. Sometimes they will joke, like\nwhen we\u2019re doing coding,\nthey\u2019ll say \u2018oh girls don\u2019t\nknow how to code\u2019. It\u2019s\ndiscouraging \u2013 you\u2019re just\ntrying to do your work,\nand then these comments\npop up. Even though it\u2019s\nclaimed to be done as a\njoke, or it\u2019s subtle, I think\nit\u2019s a reflection of how\nthey really feel about\nwomen, deep down.\u201d\nSome departments\nhave created networks for\nwomen to support each\nother on campus: students\nfrom the Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering\n(EEE) Department, for\nexample, recently set up a\nsociety for women within\nthe department, which\nthey said they hoped\nwould \u201cbring together\nan active community of\nwomen in EEE\u201d. Such\ninitiatives to improve the\nexperience of women in\nSTEM have been adopted\nat higher levels within the\nCollege \u2013 the Juno Committee in the Department\nof Physics, for example,\naims to address under-rep-resentation of women,\nwhile Imperial has been\nawarded an Athena\nSWAN Silver award for\ncommitment to advancing\nwomen in academia.\nWhile such moves\nmay address the undercurrents of sexism,\nthey have been met with\npushback from a number\nof students and staff,\nboth male and female.\nOne female respondent\nsaid: \u201cWomen at Imperial\nshould not receive any\nextra support \u2013 financially\nor emotionally. We should\nbe made equal to men in\nevery way [otherwise] we\nlook incapable.\u201d Another\nsaid they believed the\nmain source of discrimination was against white\nmiddle-class men \u2013 a view\nechoed by a number of\nstaff members who took\nour survey.\nJames*, an undergraduate aeronautics student,\ntold Felix he felt positive\ndiscriminationwasamajor\nfeature of the Faculty of\nEngineering: \u201cYou see all\nthese posters promoting\nwomen in engineering,\nand there are a number of\nbursaries or funds that are\nonly open to women, but\nno such schemes apply for\nmen. Are the women here\nto fulfill quotas? Arguably, yes. Their technical\nability seems to be lower\n[than the men], and abil-ity-wise, a larger number\nof women in engineering\ndon\u2019t know what they\u2019re\ndoing.\u201d\nProfessor Curry told\nFelix the College needed\nto \u201cpush back against\n[these ideas] even harder,\nbecause it\u2019s a ridiculous\nproposition\u201d. He says\nonly 17% of professors\nat Imperial are women,\nand \u201cif you\u2019re going to\nargue the best people are\nat the top, that\u2019s manifestly not true. That view\ncomes from people who\nmostly function within\ntheir in-group, where they\nreinforce prejudices and\nbiases\u201d.\nHe says the idea\nwomen get lower offers is\na presumption: \u201cThere is\nno evidence for it. No department has a policy that\nadmits women on lower\nratings.\u201d While quotas\nin recruitment are not\nallowed in law, he says\n\u201cdepartments are charged\nto make sure they are proactive about encouraging\nunder-represented groups\nto apply.\u201d While the\nCollege \u201cwill still appoint\nthe best candidate every\ntime\u201d, increasing the pool\nof applicants will mean\n\u201cthere is a diverse field of\ncandidates.\u201d He remains\noptimistic for the future:\n\u201cI think that is a position\nthat is untenable, that is\nlosing ground, and I think\nwe are seeing a shift.\u201d\nof respondents had experienced peers\nmaking derogatory comments\nof respondents had experienced\nderogatory statements about women\ngoing unchallenged\nWomen reported being made to feel they didn't deserve to be at Imperial // Amy Mather\n\n"

This\nproposition held that ultimate power resided in the\nmind and body of the one\nlegitimate ruler of China,\nblessed by the gods.\nWhilst much has\nchanged in the hundred\nyears of republicanism in\nChina, both the Guomindang (GMD) and even\nthe atheistic Communist\nParty of China (CCP)\nhave over the years\nadopted the Mandate from\nHeaven. After the inaugural (but brief) presidency\nof Sun Yat Sen and the\nturbulent war lord era,\nboth the CCP, led by Mao\nZedong, and the GMD,\nled by Chang Kei Shek,\nmorphed into dictatorial\nrulers. However, after the\ndeaths of these authoritarian figures, both in China\nand Taiwan, measures\nwere taken in succeeding\ndecades to prevent a future\nleader adopting a one-man\nauthoritarian rule.\nIn large parts, the\nsuccess of China in the\nlast thirty years can be\nattributed to its efficient\npolitical administration by\na collective of technocrats\nin the upper echelons of\nthe Communist Party.\nWith strict ten-year term\nlimits, generational leadership changes have been\nbrought forth regularly\nwithout turmoil and strife.\nHowever, over the\ncourse of last week, these\nvestiges on the limitations\nof power within the Communist Party of China\nwere broken up by the\nmost powerful leader of\nmodern China since Mao.\nPresident Xi-Jinping,\nin a naked power grab,\nsuccessfully abolished\nthe long standing convention of a two term\nlimit, thus paving the\nroad to becoming President-for-Life.\nIn an emotionless and\nbureaucratic display of\norderly change, the stony-eyed President introduced\nand proposed the motion\n(lifting term limits) to\nthe National People\u2019s\nCongress which in a\nStalinist manner passed\nunanimously. Remarkably, this blatant disregard\nfor tradition surprised\nvery few, considering\nthe steps Xi Jingping has\ntaken since assuming the\npresidency. The son of\na surviving member of\nMao\u2019s calamitous Long\nMarch (Xi Zongxun), Xi\nJingping descends from\npolitical royalty and his\naccession to the politburo\nin 2007 signalled the\ninevitability of him succeeding Hu-Jintao.\nSince taking power, the\nCCPhas already conferred\nthe fictitious title of \u201ccore\nleader\u201d thus elevating him\nto a previously non-ex-istent pedestal \u2013 a move\neerily similar to Deng\nXiaoping (the architect\nof the Tiananmen Square\nmassacre) being given\nthe title \u201cparamount\nleader\u201d. Furthermore, in\nan unprecedented move,\nXi-Jingping incorporated\n\u201chis political thought\u201d\ninto the Constitution with\nhis name embedded into\nthe governing document,\nwhich his two immediate\npredecessors were not\nable to do for themselves.\nThe first of the fourteen\npoints which constitutes\nthe newly inserted guiding\nprinciples of Xi Jingping\nfor the CCP states,\n\u201cEnsuring Communist\nParty of China leadership\nover all forms of work in\nChina\u201d. This destroys any\nhope of democracy taking\nroot in China any time\nsoon.\nPresident Xi is probably\nthe most powerful\nleader in the world, and\nwill remain so for the\nforeseeable future due to\nChina\u2019s geo-political and\neconomic pre-eminence\nand the absence of internal\nopposition. Recent years\nhave witnessed a purge\nof dissenting leaders\nwithin the party, all under\nthe guise of rooting out\ncorruption. However,\nvery few are fooled by the\nostentatious show trials\ncondemning past leaders,\nwhile Xi Jingping\u2019s inner\ncircle amassed their\nwealth. This is disheartening to all those who value\nliberal democracy. With a\npotential unofficial president for life, the argument\nthat greater economic\nChina\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress // Wikimedia\nPOLITICS\nAvirup Banerjee\nPolitics Editor\nHow the Chinese President broke the longstanding rule of a two-term limit for Chairmanship\nof the Communist party and the dire consequences it entails.\n\u201cThe GMD\nand CCP have\nover the years\nadopted the\nMandate from\nHeaven\u201d\n\u201cPresident\nXi is paving\nthe road to\nbecoming\nPresident-forLife\u201d\nintegration with the west\nand free market capitalism\nwould lead to an inevitable democratization of\nChina has ultimately been\nsilenced. Moreover, if his\npolicies in the recent past\ncan be taken as a predictor\nof the future, a more\nhostile and hawkish China\nwill surface.\nXi-Jingping showed the\nentire world his ambivalence to the rule of law\nand democracy when he\ntook a hard-line approach\nto Hong Kong in the\nsummer of 2014, breaking\nthe long held Chinese\ncommitment to universal\nsuffrage in the Special\nAdministered Region. By\nadding the caveat that any\ncandidate wishing to be in\nthe ballot for Chief-Executive (yes, that is what\nthey call their Mayor in\nHong Kong) must first\nreceive the blessing from\nBeijing, which handpicks\nthe candidates the people\nof Hong Kong can choose\nfrom, the promise of universal suffrage enshrined\ninHongKong\u2019sBasicLaw\nArticle 45 was nullified.\nWhen Hong Kong was\nhanded over by the British\nto China in 1997, it was\npreceded by decades of\nnegotiations which gave\nassurances to the British\nGovernment and most\nimportantly to the people\nof Hong Kong regarding\nprotections to civil rights.\nXi-Jingping\u2019s refusal to\naccept any opposition in\nHong Kong to greater\nintegration resulted in\ncast iron promises from\nthe Chinese state. Dangerously, the mainland government actively pushed\nfor extreme police action\nto quash the non-violent\n2014 Umbrella Revolution by using pepper spray\nand acts of violence.\nFor sixteen of the last\ntwenty centuries, China\nhas consistently been in\nthe top two with regards\nto GDP. To Xi Jingping,\nthe rise of China is simply\nthe restoration of the\nnatural order. In fact, the\nMandarin term for China,\n\u201czh\u014dng-gu\u00f3\u201d, derives its\nname from the idea that\nChina is at the \u201ccentre of\ncivilization\u201d. Thus XiJingping has endeavoured\nto assert China\u2019s pre-em-inence to the world using\nboth soft and hard power.\nXi-Jingping understands that China is at\na cross-road. Slowing\neconomic growth, rising\ndebts, and other internal\nproblems like environmental pollution have\nthe potential to unravel\nthe CCP\u2019s grip on power\nby a growing dissatisfied\nmiddle class. Xi-Jingping\nhas effectively used\npopulist economic\nmeasures to meet the\ngrowing aspirations of\nChina\u2019s middle class. For\nyears now, resentment\nhas grown in China over\npoor air quality due to the\ncountry\u2019s rapid industrial-isation. President Xi has\neffectively responded to\nthis challenge by investing\nbillions into green energy\nsources, such that China is\nnow the largest producer\nof newly-added renewable energy. Through his\nOne-Belt initiative, the\nChinese government has\nsustained (by increasing\nits national debt) millions\nof infrastructure jobs. Furthermore, the initiative,\nwhich aims to recreate\nthe ancient silk road, has\nincreased China\u2019s profile\ninternationally. The rise\nof China has collided with\nXi-Jingping\u2019s political\nrise, which has meant dire\nconsequences for China\u2019s\nneighbours. In foreign\npolicy, Xi Jingping has\nstepped up China\u2019s rapid\nremilitarisation with\nspecific attention given\nto the South China Sea.\nBy propping up artificial\nislands and laying claim\nto the territorial waters of\nsovereign neighbouring\nstates, President XI has\nindicated China will take\nan aggressive approach\nto establishing regional\nhegemony over the United\nStates.\nFor much of China\u2019s\nhistory, instead of\nexternal threats, internal\ncivil wars have been the\nsource of bloodshed and\nchaos that have weakened\nand replaced one governing power by another.\nIn the mid-19th\ncentury,\nXi Jingping in the White House// Flickr\n\u201cXi Jingping\nhas stepped\nup China\u2019s\nrapid military\nbuild up on the\nSouth China\nSea\u201d\n\u201cXi-Jingping\nhas shown\nthe entire\nworld his\nambivalence\nto the rule of\nlaw\u201d\nthe Taiping Rebellion\nresulted in the deaths of\n30 million Chinese (more\nthan the total casualties\nof World War One).\nChina is a geographically\nand culturally diverse\npolitical entity unrivalled\nby any western nation.\nSucceeding generations\nof Chinese leaders have\nfeared this unity would be\nbroken if greater freedoms\nwere given to the masses\ndue to resentment over\nan unequal upliftment\nby China\u2019s economic\nrise. Xi-Jingping\u2019s father\nwho was a political\nleader under Mao saw\nthe horrors of the Great\nLeap Forward (which\nkilled 20 million from\nfamine) and the Cultural\nRevolution (which\nstunted the intellectual\ndevelopment of millions\nof Chinese children).\nThe Chinese have a long\nmemory \u2013 there won\u2019t\never be a newer iteration\nof Mao\u2019s Little Red Book.\nXi Jingping is a Frank\nUnderwood-esque brutal\npragmatist who is less\ndriven by ideology than\nrealism. President Xi is\nmore ideologically akin\nto Deng Xio-Ping in\nbelieving that \u201cit doesn\u2019t\nmatter if a cat is black or\nwhite, so long as it catches\nmice\u201d. However, through\nthis blatant power move,\nPresident Xi has shown\nhis willingness to sacrifice\nconstitutional norms for\ngreater stability.\nThe ancient Chinese\nhad a curse: \u201cmay he\nlive in interesting times\u201d.\nWell, like it or not these\nare interesting times.\nThe developing world in\nAfrica, Latin America,\nand Asia, which has been\nsuppressed for the last two\nhundred years is finally\nawaking from its long\nslumber.\nThe allure of establishing a strong man to\nthe Chinese political\nestablishment is clear, as\nit would assist in guiding\nChina through these\ntransformative times. XiJingping has gambled that\nthe many problems facing\nChina can only be solved\nby establishing a strong\nauthoritarian leader, un-encumbered by short-ter-mism. To all those who\nare friends of China, we\nwish China all the best.\nHowever, to those of\nus who also value the\nimportance of democracy\nand liberty, it would be a\nsad proposition if China\u2019s\nrise can only be propelled\nthrough authoritarianism.\n\n"

With\nthe majority of the team\nchoosing to tackle the\nhalf-marathon distance,\nand a couple opting for\nthe more manageable\n10K, they all met at the\nreasonably early time of\n7:30am on the concourse\nof Euston station.\nUpon arrival in Milton\nKeynes the athletes first\nhad to come to terms\nwith the vast number\nof roundabouts in this\nderelict ghost town. After\na reasonably lengthy walk\nto the start line by the\nspaceship-like ski centre,\nthe squad began the usual\npre-race ritual involving\nteam photos, toilet trips,\nand warm-ups. Before\nlong, the start line was\nawash with the red and\nnavy of Imperial vests.\nThe course included\nweather conditions and\nsolid tarmac compared to\nthe club\u2019s usual terrain of\nmud and grass meant that\nthis was a fast race.\nA particularly nifty\nstart was made by Kirill\nMikhaylov and Fergus\nJohnson which saw them\nlead the field of over 1400\nrunners for the first 200m\nbefore settling into the\nlead pack of around ten.\nFor many of the\nICXCAC runners,\nthis was their first half\nmarathon race, and for\nothers it was the furthest\nthey had ever run! This\nmade the resulting times\neven more impressive.\nSpecial mentions go to\nLeanne Lyons for leaving\nher race shoes on the bus\non the way there, Kirill\nMikhaylov for coming\nfirst Imperial male and 7th\nOverall in 1:18:04 after\nan athlete\u2019s breakfast of\nthree doughnuts, a \u201cpastry\nswirly thing\u201d and several\nown-brand energy drinks\nfrom a discount supermar-ket.\nShoutouts also go\nto Thibault Audic for\nthrowing up twice and\nstill having an insane\nsprint finish, Alex Stuart-Smith for an amazing\nPB of 1:32, and finally\nLiv Papaioannou for her\nsupport and brownies.\nAfter the race, the exhaustion was offset by the\nweighty medal waiting at\nthe finish line. Following\nsome recovery by lying on\nthe floor, the team enjoyed\nspectating strangers \u2013 the\nrace numbers had the\nrunner\u2019s names on which\nadded an extra level of\nhumour.\nThe team then went\nfor a cheeky Wagas with\nthe chaps before leaving\nMK to return to the me-tropolis.

Straight to the back\nof the top deck, it proved\nto be a buzzing bus ride\nfull of pre-race optimism,\neVoting, and breath-tak-ing scenery including\nmultiple sharks \u2013 one of\nwhich was embedded in\nsomebody\u2019s roof.\nThey soon left the\nbus and strolled to Iffley\ntrack to be greeted by\nmany other athletes from\nuniversities and running\nclubs listening to loud,\nupbeat Indie music. The\nflat, scenic course was\napproximately 7km and\nran along the towpath and\nthrough Christ Church\nMeadow. Imperial\u2019s squad\nconsisted of two Men\u2019s\nteams and two Mixed\nteams consisting of four\nrunners, and one Women\u2019s\nteam consisting of three\nrunners, with each runner\ncompleting one leg each.\nAfter a swift team al-location, a short briefing,\nand a minute\u2019s silence\nfor Sir Bannister, it was a\nflying start to Teddy Halls\nfor the athletes.\nChris Olley immediately took charge pushing on\nto run the fastest leg of the\nday (20:46 \u2013 30 seconds\nahead of 2nd\n!) as part\nof the \u201cImperial Mixed\nA\u201d Team. He passed the\nbaton onto Sarah Johnson\n(25:16) who proved to\nbe the 2nd\nfastest female\nof the day. Followed by\nstrong contributions from\nAlex Mundell (29:47) and\nKirill Mikhaylov (24:33),\nthey finished with a silver\nmedal as the 2nd\nMixed\nTeam overall. An impressive first leg from Fergus\nJohnson (24:12), followed\nby Jack McKeon (25:30),\nMen\u2019s Captain Lewis\nJackson (25:18) and an\nenergetic finish from\nDuncan Hunter (25:21)\npropelled \u201cImperial Men\u2019s\nA\u201d to 9th\noverall.\nIt was a strong performance by the \u201cBeasts from\nthe South East\u201d: Henry\nMaynard (27:52), Chew\nYi Heng (27:52), Ian\nNapier (27:12) and Alex\nBaldwin (28:15), who\nfinished 27th\n. \u201cImperial\nWomen\u2019s A\u201d comprised\nof Jenny Lea (31:09),\nWendy Lu Chen (35:35)\nand Anna Fleming (33:28)\nand continued the success\nfinishing 11th\noverall.\nFinally, Heinrich Hummel\n(27:27) and Maryna\nVoloshyna (36:58) drove\nthe baton round for \u201cHyde\nPark Gilets\u201d (who finished\n12th\nMixed Team), before\nhanding it to Fergus\nJohnson and Jack McKeon\nto run their second legs\nof the day. They deserve\nmajor kudos.\nAfter soaking up the\nbustling atmosphere and\na quick shower, the squad\nwandered back through\nOxford to St Edmund\nHall for a post-race\ncelebration and result\nannouncements. There\nwas an interesting yet\nvast array of sandwiches\nranging from lemon curd\nto cheese and pickle,\ncake, fruit, and drinks.\nDeservedly, the Imperial\nathletes continued their\ncarb overload in the local\nWetherspoons before a\nlate return to London for\na much needed rest.\nSPORTS\nFergus Johnson\nICXCAC Secretary\nSPORTS\nJack McKeon\nICXCAC member\nKirill was too busy binge drinking energy drinks to be in the photo // ICXCAC\nLSE retain the City Varsity\u2122\nSPORTS\nNick UstaranAnderegg\nICURFC Press Officer\nT\nhe City Varsity\u2122\nII,heldlastFriday\nat Rosslyn Park,\nwas the second\nannual varsity match\nbetween Imperial College\nLondon and London\nSchool of Economics.\nThis promised to be an\nexciting match and, after\nmonths of hype, lived\nup to expectations. The\nmatch kicked off and immediately proved to be a\nvery physical game, with\nbig collisions coming in\nfrom both sides. Early\npressure and a dominant\npack from Imperial led\nto LSE making mistakes,\ngiving Imperial the\nchance to counter-attack\na couple of times. Perhaps\ntoo eager to stop LSE\nbehind the game line in\ndefence, Imperial gave\naway a penalty for offside\nand allowed LSE\u2019s kicker\nto make the score 0-3.\noff for many phases, but\nquick recycling of the ball\nand a missed tackle from\nImperial allowed LSE\nto score under the posts.\nImperial were down 0-10\nearly in the game. Imperial\nresponded strongly and\nstarted attacking out wide\nthrough Oliver Duffy,\nKieran McMorran and\nHugo Koide. McMorran\nwas stopped just short of\nthe line, only for Jerome\nHallett to bundle over in\nthe next phase for a try.\nJames Field successfully\nconverted from afar, using\nthe wind to curl the ball\nbetween the uprights \u2013 his\nhard work during Harry\nAllingham\u2019s free kicking\nlessons clearly paying off.\n7-10 to LSE at half time.\nImperial began the\nsecond half determined to\nscore first and take control\nof the match. Weak penalties from Imperial allowed\nLSE to exert some attacking pressure and they were\nsoon awarded a penalty\ndeep in the Imperial half.\nThis was kicked to make\nthe score 7-13. Field made\nthe kick off contestable,\nbut a mistimed tackle in\nthe air from Will Ainsley\nresulted in him being\nsent to the sin bin for 10\nminutes to contemplate\nhis actions. Imperial did\nnot let their heads drop\nand gave everything in\ndefence, with the usual\nsuspects Martin Head and\nToby Daniels making lots\nof tackles.\nReckless Ainsley was\neventually, reluctantly,\ninvited back onto the pitch\nby the referee and Imperial\nwere back to 15 men. This\nwas an opportunity to get\nback into the game, and\nquick play between the\nforwards gave Imperial\nattacking territory. Field\nbroke LSE\u2019s line and attempted to offload to Nick\nUstaran-Anderegg (who\nwould definitely have\noutpaced the fullback\nand scored), but alas this\nwas intercepted. Imperial\nscrambled in defence\nas LSE counterattacked\nand prevented them from\nscoring. Keen to uphold\nQuigley and prop Amin\nOmarouayache were\nbrought on to open up\nthe game more in attack.\nImperial now started to\nlook more threatening and\na 30m break from Quigley\nalmost resulted in a try.\nNow back on the pitch,\nDuffy showed everyone\nwhat Imperial had been\nmissing by beating his\nman on the outside\u2026\nand then kicking the ball\nstraightintotouch.Despite\nleaving everything on the\npitch, Imperial\u2019s efforts\ndid not eventually materialise into points, and the\nmatch ended 7-16 with\nLSE crowned champions\nof The City Varsity\u2122 II.\nThank you to everyone\nwho was involved organising and/or running\nThe City Varsity\u2122 II, we\ncould not have done it\nwithout you.\nDespite very physical rugby and some great plays, our Imperial team is still hungry for a win in the City Varsity.\nChin up and eyes looking forward to claiming the title next year!\nImperial attempting to break through the LSE lines.. // ICURFC\n7 19\nImperial\nRugby\n1st\nTeam\nLSE\nRugby\n1st\nTeam\nV\n\u201cThe game\nproved to be a\nvery physical\ngame, with\nbig collisions\ncoming in from\nboth sides\u201d\nAfter the restart, a\nturnover from LSE in\nmidfield allowed them\nto attack down the left\nwing.

There is\none, invariably, discussing\nBitcoin. And there is one\nreporting on a shooting in\na US school or university.\nWhilst the statistics have\nbeen inflated by some, it\ndoesn\u2019t take much thought\nto appreciate that our\nAmerican cousins have a\nseriousproblemwithguns.\nThe debate, like many in\nthe modern Colosseum of\nsocial media, is heated,\nwith vehement adherents\nto ideologies on both\nsides. Of course, this issue\nis hardly new, having\nplagued Presidents from\nObama back to Reagan.\nThe prime difficulty in putting an end to\nthese atrocities lies in the\nSecond Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution. This\ndeclares, in defence of the\nindividual against potential tyranny of the state,\nthe right to keep and bear\narms. Now, this doesn\u2019t\nmean that the government\ncannot do anything about\nit: State and Federal\nauthorities have the legal\npower to regulate the\npossession and use of\nfirearms, within certain\nbounds. However, politicians and Americans have\nsimply refused to compromise on the issue. Unlike\nother contentious political\ndebates, the charged and\nhighly partisan political\nenvironment in the US\nhas decided that, for legislation concerning guns,\nthere is no compromise\nto be had. The powerful\nNational Rifle Association\n(NRA), which boasts over\nfive million members\nand control of basically\nthe entire Republican\nparty, has repeatedly and\nvocally lobbied against\ngun control in any\nmeasure that has so far\nbeen proposed. And that\nis why President Trump is\na beacon of hope. I really\nnever thought I would\nbe saying that; let me\nexplain.\nDon\u2019t get me\nwrong; Trump is not my\nidea of a model of human\nbehaviour, and I certainly\ndon\u2019t endorse a good\nnumber of his statements\nand policies. However,\nalthough his erratic state-ments, off-script speeches\nand late night tweeting are\ncertainly highly politically unconventional, and\narguably un-Presidential,\nit is this quality \u2013 of a lack\nof any desire to be liked or\nrespected on Capitol Hill\n\u2013 that provides a potential\navenue of progress for\ngun control in America.\nThe simple fact is that,\nwhilst Democrats hate\nTrump, so do Republicans. They made every\neffort to get rid of him as\ntheir candidate, and many\nRepublican lawmakers\nstill hold him in contempt.\nBut he doesn\u2019t care. He\nhas only ever cared about\none thing: Donald Trump.\nNow, that\u2019s hardly an\nadmirable characteristic,\nbut what it does mean\nis that he pretty much\nonly does what he thinks\nhe should do, and not\nwhat people tell him he\nshould do. So, when he\nencounters problems,\nhe is perfectly happy to\nchange his mind. He has\nabsolutely no concerns\nabout his political status,\nbecause he doesn\u2019t do\nconventional politics. He\nspeaks to his supporters\ndirectly, and engages with\nwhomever he needs to in\norder to get what he wants\nto get done, done. He\nworked with Democrats\non a Spending Bill, and\nhas been negotiating with\nthem, much more closely\nthan some Republicans\nwould like, to make political concessions in return\nfor increased border\nsecurity measures. In\nshort \u2013 Trump does what\nhe wants, not what he\nthinks will poll well, or\nwhat his party, or their\nlobbyists, want him to.\nAnd in this, he offers\nan opportunity for real\nchange. The NRA has\npushed all the Republican\nSenators and Congressman that it financially\nsupports \u2013 a large number\n\u2013 to give no quarter on\ngun control legislation.\nBut, for all the ears the\nNRA has in Washington,\nit now lacks that of a key\nofficial: the President. In\na video recording of part\nof a bi-partisan meeting\nheld by Trump to discuss\ngun control, which the\nGuardian recently published online (I would\nencourage you to watch\nit), the President very\nopenly called out Lawmakers for being \u201cafraid\nof the NRA\u201d, before proclaiming \u201cthey have less\npower over me\u2026. What\ndo I need?\u201d. Now, don\u2019t\nthink that he isn\u2019t also in\nbed with the NRA: they\ndonated $30 million to\nhis Presidential campaign,\nand he has proclaimed\nhimself their friend re-peatedly. But. Whilst he\nmay support their broad\naims in supporting the\nSecond Amendment, he\ndoes not rely on their\nsupport in the same way\nthat prior Presidents have\ndone, and that current Republican officials do. He\nlikes them, but he doesn\u2019t\nneed them. Trump has a\ntendency of being very\nhappy to compromise on\nwhat hard-line Republicans view as politically\nsacrosanct, in order to get\ndone whatever he happens\nto want at the time. Gun\ncontrol is the ultimate\nRepublican red line, but\nPresident Trump doesn\u2019t\ncare. As a result, there are\ntwo clear paths to the possibility that Trump may\nfinally secure gun control\nin America.\nFor the first part,\ngun control offers him\nprobably the largest bartering chip for Democratic\nsupport that he could ask\nfor; the possibility that\nhe could get Democratic\nsupport to build his wall,\nin return for lasting and\neffective gun control,\nis very real. Secondly,\nTrump is sympathetic\nto gun control, and, as\npointed out, he pretty\nmuch does what he likes,\nand leaves party lines to\nbe blurred by his words\nand actions. Therefore,\neven without an exchange\nwith the Democrats, gun\ncontrol under Trump\ncould well happen, if he\nis convicted enough in\nhis belief that it should be\nlegislated. In the aforementioned meeting, he\nsupported the re-introduc-tion of a bill to the Senate\nthat imposes \u201cuniversal\nbackground checks for\ncommercial gun purchas-es, including at gun shows\nand over the internet\u201d. He\nargued strongly against a\nRepublican, saying that,\nwhere there is concern\nover the mental health\nof an individual who\npossesses guns, the guns\nshould be confiscated\nimmediately, and due\nprocess \u2013 i.e. adjudication\nin courts \u2013 could happen\nlater. His approach is by\nno means liberal, but it is,\nif nothing else, pragmatic.\nHe supports banning\nassault weapons, raising\nthe minimum purchase\nage, and enforcing stricter\nmental health screening,\nall sensible approaches,\nand all vast steps forward\nin the immovable tussle of\nAmerican politics.\nFor all that his confused\ntweeting and conflicting\nstatements give off an\nair of incompetence, and\ndisorganisation, they\nfundamentally betray\na glaring self-interest.\nTrump wants to do what\nhe said he would get done,\nand anything that pops\nup along the way that he\nfancies. He is not a committed ideologue, nor does\nhe care for the support of\nthose who are. Whilst this\nmay, for the most part, be\nto his detriment, he might\njust end up wielding this\ntendency to the benefit\nof the people of America.\nHere\u2019s hoping that gun\ncontrol is his legacy.\nLets put those normal sized hands to use // Flickr\n\n"
