    "content": "JLILUL\nSLeiriews 1\nTheatre\nMY SPIES tell me that a good time may\nbe had by taking a river boat down the\nThames to Greenwich. What with the\n1776 Exhibition, the Cutty Sark and the\nNaval College, you may fill a whole\nday with sightseeing. Whilst I cannot\nvouch for this myself, I can tell you that\nthe Greenwich Theatre is well worth a visit. Next week they have extended their\nrun of two new plays by John Mortimer,\nstarring Denholm Elliott, Peter Woodthorpe\nand Eleanor Bron. Fear of Heaven was\nfirst broadcast on Radio3 last February\nand it is because of that, that I didn't enjoy it very much. Although an admirable\nradio play its translation to the stage is less successful for two reasons.\nFirstly, because the plot concerns\ntwo Englishmen who wake up, after\naccidents, in a Italian hospital with a magnificent Cinguecents ceiling and\nbelieve themselves to be in heaven, the\nillusion that they might possibly imagine\nthis to be heaven is substantially reduced.\nWhilst the radio version gave usa chance to picture in our minds a ceiling with so many angels, bearded prophets,\npul ti and the foot of God( his big toe\nAs dry as old toast\nover eighteen inches long), the reality\nof the stage performance affords no\nsuch illusions. Secondly, the performance is necessarily static, with two men lying\nin their hospital beds. Although Mr\nElliott makes the occasional foray across\nthe stage it is only in order to give the\nplay a bit of action. I can only hope that\nthe BBC broadcast it again.\nThe second play is The Prince of\nDarkness and concerns some extraordinary goings-on in a South London\nvicarage. Whilst the in com bent is bury\norganising get-together s for raincoat\nfanatics and granny knot fanciers, his new co rate, ex RAF padre AK Bulstrode,\nis seducing his wife by performing\nmiracles. Peter Woodthorpe is brilliant\nas the middle-aged p him sol clad vicar, jiving to the works of Queen and of\nSimon and Garfunkel.\nBack in the centre of London, though\nprobably less easy to reach than Greenw ich, which is fifteen minutes out of\nCharing Cross on the Southern Region, the Open Air Theatre Regents Park has opened its new season with Othello.\nThis is probably Shakespeare's most\nsingle-minded piece, with very little\nrelief from Iago's plot to reek havoc in\nOthello' s marriage. Without the aid of\nNurse, Porter and Gravedigger this\nplay is as dry a sold toast and the\nproduction does very little to help.\nRobert Stephens Othello takes his lines at breakneck speed as if there were\nsome competition for the most words\nspoken in a single breath. Towards the\nend, though, he mellows and in the final\nmurder scene is magn if ici ent. The trees of the park provide a perfect backdrop for Mark Ne gin's versatile\ngreen tower.. Natural distractions come\nfrom the twittering of the birds and\nshowers of fluffy white seeds from the\ntrees; unnatural distractions are the\naircraft and the park keepers' loudspeakers announcing the closing of the\npark. There is excellent food at the bar\nand mulled wine to warm you in the\ninterval. The sign posting is less than\nsatisfactory, the theatre entrance is through the Rose Garden opposite Bedford\nCollege. Don't bother to book in advance,\nthe night I went the auditorium was not\nfull, but arrive early to join the boxoffice queue. THOMAS STEVENSON Music\n'Bellamy Brothers, Featuring\n\"Let Your Love Flow'\" - Warner\nBros (56242)\nA HAPPY, jovial album -that's as frolic ky as summer itself, but an album\nnone the less that will get overlooked by\nmany record buyers. Not that there's anything substantially wrong with this\ncollection of songs from the West Coast Bellamy Brothers; production, harmonies,\nperformances and lyrics are all well done.\nYet the album lacks that ' Je ne sais\nquoi' that would take it from average to\ngood.\nThe LP features many songs in WestC oas try th m of 'Let Your Love Flow';\npleasant numbers with short catchy, but\nwell thought out, lyrics. One can't fault\nthe songs themselves except that they\nare slightly insubstantial, in that I find\nit rather difficult to remember the numbers\nwhen the record's finished. I found the Bellamy' s rather addicted\nto this West-Coast ry th m,a pity since\ntheir creative ability shone through move\non the less orthodox tracks. Tracks like\nBest yet to come Cinema\nLiving In the West, a tale about western\ngunfighters such as Frank and Jesse James, and Inside Of My Guitar let the\nsongwriting talents of David Bellamy\nexcel and capture the Brothers interpretive\nskills well. These two differing songs are\nrife with emotion and succeed much more\nthan the 'Standard'West-Coast ry th m song.\nAnother fine song, in truth the album's best, is Let Fantasy Live. The pensive\nmood of this really caught me, as did the strong vocal treatment. The synthesized vocals at the end were particularly\nin gene o us and fully in keeping with the\nexp lor at ive nature of the track.\nIn short, the Bellamy' s have produced\nan album that even at its most ordinary\nis decidedly un perfunctory, yet fails to\nshine throughout. As a debut album for\nWarners the LP is a creditable effort\nand won't disappoint too many. YetI firmly believe that the best of the\nBellamy s' is still to come. Their\ncreative ability, particularly David's, is indisputable butt has still to manifest\nitself in a tangible form. Their next\nalbum should be really good!\nCLIVE DEWEY FELIX\nSTAFF!!\nWANTED\nAnyone interested in working for\nFELIX next year in any capacity\nshould contact Clive Dewey at the\nFELIX Office.\nMeanies rule ok!\n\" THE LAST HARD MEN\"( Fox Rank) directed by Andrew V McL a glen; starring Charlton Heston and James\nCoburn.\nA CURIOUSLY unromantic and hard\nhitting film, THE LAST HARD MEN is\na story of vengeance. Sam Gurgade\n(Charlton Heston) is the goodie; an\nex-lawman forced to take up his shooters\nafter having recently laid himself out\nto grass.\nAt the end of his gunsight is Provo\n(James Coburn), a half.breed train\nrobber and killer whose only ambition\nis to settle his score with Burgade.\nTogether with six other meanies, he\nescapes from Yuma Territorial Prison, a closer approximation to hell, one\ncould not really hope for.\nCaught in the middle of this feud, in\nwhich all the shots hit below the belt,\nis Burgade's daughter (Barbara Hershey),\nher boyfriend (a very green looking\nChristopher Mitchum) and a rule-book\nsheriff (Michael Parks). Typical of the\nsort of low tactics used, is the raping\nof Burgade's daughter by two Provo' sco ho its in an attempt to lure Burgade\nout.\nAs far as its entertainment value\ngoes, it's about average; certainly it,\ndoes not rank with some of the films\ncurrently on show. The acting ranges\nfrom mediocre to good; Coburn and\nHershey shining out above a tired\nlooking Heston. Chris Mitchum gives\nan insipid showing on his first major\nouting, but should improve as he gains\nmore experience. If you are in a mean\nmood then avoid this one otherwise\ngive it a go if you have nothing better\nto do' PAUL EK PEN YONG "

Cat let\nout of\nthe bag\nCOLLEGE OFFICIALS are\nannoyed and puzzled that an\nofficial report by Sir David\nHuddie, on social science courses at IC, was leaked to\nthe Times Higher Education\nSupplement last week.\nThe report, which is not\ndue to be discussed by the\nBoard of Studies until next\nweek, had at that point only\nbeen circulated to Heads of\nDepartments. According to\nTHE S the report is said to\nrecommend that the teaching\nof social studies in undergraduate courses 'ought to be\nsignificantly expanded'. In\nparticular it recommends the\ninclusion of management\nstudies, industrial sociology\nand economics in all undergraduate courses.\nThe proposals are no\ndoubt intended to give IC\ngraduates ' a broad understanding of society and a grasp of managerial skills'. The THE S article continues\n\" The report considers\nwhat has been a vexed division within the college between\nthe sociologists in the\nIndustrial Sociology Unit and\nthe engineers and mixed\nsocial scientists of the\nmanagement sciences department. The point was\nforcefully put to Sir David that what was needed was a unified social science\ndepartment involving sociologists, economists and\npsychologists, which would\nbe better equip ed to make a contribution across a whole\nrange of undergraduate\ncourses\". \u2022 Sir David Huddie, a former chairman of Rolls Royce Aero Engines Inc, is now senior research fellow\nin the Mechanical Engineering\ndepartment.\nLSO withdrawal\nimminent\nIT WAS revealed last week\nthat IC Union has been a member of the London\nStudents Organisation\n(LSO) for the last 2 years\nwithout a mandate from a Union General Meeting.\nAs a result of this the\nUnion has been paying a \u00a3 5 0 0 annual subscription\nto LSO. The news came last\nFriday at the Joint Union\nFinance Committee ( UFC), which decided to defer payment of the Union's LSO subscription until the matter\nhas been fully discussed at aUG M. The question of LSO subscriptions has, however,\nbeen briefly mentioned at\nprevious UFC and Council Meetings. At last year's Joint UFC, the impression\ngiven by outgoing ICU President Trevor Phillips, was that ICU was joining\nthe West London section of\nLSO, which he thought\nreplaced the old USK Organisation (University of\nSouth Kensington).\nIt seems likely that ICU's membership of LSO will be\ndiscussed at the first U GM of the Autumn term. LSO is now moving into its third\nyear with Mr Phillips as its\nsabbatical secretary. Mr\nPhillips has already been\ninvited to speak at the U GM. However, it is Mr Peter Teague's considered opinion\nthat the meeting will overwhelmingly reject any moves\nto continue as members of\nLSO. According to IC Union\nExternal Affairs Officer\nand next year's Deputy\nPresident, Derrick \" the Mole\" Everett, IC had not\nreceived any significant\nbenefit from being members\nof LSO for the last two\nyears.\nThe UFC meeting at which final financial allocations to\nUnion clubs and societies\nAt (Long) Last\nyou've oil been waiting for' Jh)\nTHE BREMSSTRAHUJNG BOOK\nwill be on sa Le -from fT lond at j[!

I time J f1L were to be decided also heard four other claims all of them being ruled out of\norder.\nOne of these was a \u00a35\nclaim from Dave Chance, Welfare Officer elect. On Friday 4th June, a student\nclaiming to be a Rhodesian, walked into the Union office\nwhose only occupant at the\ntime was Bill Gerrard. The student, sporting a wet\npatch down the front of his trousers, wanted to see the\nWelfare Officer to borrow\nsome money.\nHis situation was this;\nhe had no money and his artificial bladder had burst \u2014\nhence the wet patch. Artificial bladders, he informed Mr \u2022\nGerrard were \u00a31 each and\ncame in packs of five.\nCould he possibly borrow \u00a35?\nHe was to rendezvous with\nhis father outside the Science\nMuseum at 4.00pm that\nafternoon. He would return\nthe loan after collecting some money from him. Alas, Mr Gerrard did not\nhave \u00a35 on his person, but\nall was not lost. Mr Chance walked in just at that moment.\nThe situation was \" explained* to him and did he have \u00a35J Yes. A very relieved looking\nstudent collared the \u00a35\npromising to return with it\nlater that afternoon \u2014 Mr\nChance is still awaiting\nhis return.....\nMr Chance's claim was denied and he was told to\nput it down to experience.\nHowever, this is not an isolated incident.

    "content": "MU X3 Enthusiastic\nas ever\nNOW IN ITS fourth year, Imperial College Canoe Club is still functioning as enthusiastically as ever.\nThe club is organised so that members\ncan become proficient at canoeing whilst\nenjoying it in any or all of its aspects:\nfrom drifting quietly down a river admiring\nthe scenery and drinking cool cans of\nFosters, to the more insane practice of\nsurfing at Bude under stormy conditions.\nThis year many trips have been made to\nfairly local sites (such as Shepperton and\nOld Winsor rivers) to gain practice. In\naddition to these day or afternoon\nexcursions, several weekend trips to the\nUpper Wye Valley, the river Usk and Bude\nseaside have been made. On the latter\ntype of excursion ample opportunity\nis available for the leaving and furthering\nof canoe techniques; river, sea and pub\nsessions are all well organised and\nintegrated.\nAs regards competitions, I CCC has\nbeen well represented at many events.\nLast November we sent teams to the\nBedford-Ouse race and the famous Exe Descent (the toughest long distance\ncanoe race in Britain). At each the overall\nstandard of our entry was high. In the\nSpring term our Club members formed the\nhard-core of the University of London team\nsent up to Inverconnie (near Aberdeen) for\nthe British Universities' Canoe Slalom.\nOn the second day of this event we\nentered many individual events, maintaining high standards throughout \u2014 unfortunately\nnot high enough. It must be noted, however,\nthat conditions were far from ideal: Club members had camped in snow drifts for\ntwo nights and even the drivers of the\nRC C vans had collapsed from fatigue!\nAt the beginning of this term the\nclub entered several teams in the Newbury\nSlalom, one of them managing to capture\nsecond prize in the Canadian double event.\nA celebratory trip to the Gower is being made at the end of this term.
