The Royal\nPhilharmonic Orchestra\nconcert paid homage to the\nintegral roles Stravinsky,\nKorngold, and Dvorak\nplayed in the transitions\nfrom late Romantic to 20th\ncentury music, with the\nintegration of Romantic\nlyrical harmonies with the\ndissonance of 20th century melodies. And what a\ncelebration it was!\nThe concert opened\nwith some of Stravinsky\u2019s\n(1882-1971) lesser known\nworks, the Suite for Small\nOrchestra Nos. 1 and\n2. Originally written as\npiano duets, the Russian\ncomposer orchestrated\nthe works between\n1917-1925, shortly after\ncompleting his famous\nFirebird and Rite of\nSpring. They represent\nStravinsky\u2019s early Russian\nperiod transitioning into\nhis Neoclassical period,\nwith lighthearted tones\nand prominent syncopated rhythms contrasting\nthe occasional dissonant\nmelodies and harmonies.\nThe colourful rhythms and\nexpressive wit permeate\nthe Suites, lending an\ninfectious charm to the\nstructured dance forms\nas Stravinsky explored\nhis compositional voice.\nThe RPO did justice to\nStravinsky\u2019s curious and\nexplorative voice of the\nSuites as the orchestra\u2019s\ntenacity brought the\naudience onto the dancefloor in spirit.\nHeralding in the\nAustrian composer\nKorngold (1897-1957)\nwas British violinist\nJennifer Pike. Korngold\nwas a child prodigy,\nhaving written his first\nballet at eleven years of\nage, and was lauded in\nVienna for his natural\nmusical talent. He is one\nof the most influential\ncomposers for Hollywood\nfilms of the era, and much\nof what we recognise\n\u201cStartling\nclarity of notes\nand perfect\nintonation of\nchords\u201d\n\u201cA truly\nimpressive and\ntechnically-perfect\nperformance,\nstaccato jigs\nand all\u201d\nas the quintessential\ndramatic Hollywood\nmusic is none other than\nKorngold\u2019s personal style.\nKorngold was Jewish\nand vowed to not write\nanything besides film\nmusic, which he used to\nsupport his family whilst\nHitler was in power. His\nViolin Concerto was the\nfirst that Korngold wrote\nfollowing the resolution\nof the Second World War\nand is one of his most\ncelebrated pieces. Its three\nmovements share many of\nthe themes and melodies\nhe used for Hollywood\nfilms such as Juarez\nand The Prince and the\nPauper, but with the\ndramatic flair required for\nfilm music stripped back\nto more clean, poignant\nmelodies of the violin.\nWhilst soloist Pike was\ntechnically impeccable,\nher interpretation of its\ntwo interlinking themes\nin the first movement,\n\u2018Moderato nobile\u2019, was\na touch too stoic for my\nliking, and could have\ndone with greater emotional depth. However,\nPike warmed up in\nthe second movement,\n\u2018Romanze\u2019. Its slower,\nsweet melodies soared\nhigh and pulled at the audience\u2019s heartstrings, with\nPike\u2019s startling clarity of\nnotes and perfect intonation of chords lending a\nprecision and yearning to\nthe movement. The final\nmovement, \u2018Allegro assai\nvivace\u2019, is the most technically challenging and\ntheatrical, as evidenced\nby Pike\u2019s E-string dramatically snapping halfway\nthrough. She was quick\non her feet and borrowed\nthe concertmaster\u2019s violin\nto continue playing, never\nmissing a note \u2013 leaving\nthe concertmaster to\nswap violins with the\nassistant concertmaster\nso that he could play a\nbrief short solo during the\nmovement (in addition\nto leading the orchestra,\nof course!) Despite all of\nthis, Pike completed the\nmovement beautifully,\nhaving fully warmed up\nfrom the slightly wooden\nfirst movement to deliver\na truly impressive and\ntechnically-perfect perfor-mance, staccato jigs and\nall. She finished her performance with an encore\npiece \u2013 Bacewicz\u2019s Polish\nCaprice \u2013 that showcased\nher skills with quick,\nchallenging chords and\nslow, deep melodies. This\nBritish soloist is definitely\none to keep an eye out for.\nThe concert finished\nwith Dvorak\u2019s (1841-1904) famous Symphony\nNo. 9, From the New\nWorld, written when he\nwas the director of the\nNational Conservatory of\nMusic in New York City.\nDvorak\u2019s syncopated\nrhythms with modal\nmelodies pay homage\nto traditional folk tunes\nof both America and\nEurope, with whispers of\nfamous Native American\nmelodies such as \u2018Swing\nLow, Sweet Chariot\u2019 and\n\u2018Massa Dear\u2019 reflecting\nhis fascination with native\nAfrican-American music.\nThe New World symphony\nopens with a motif heavily\ninfluenced by Beethoven\u2019s\nNinth Symphony, before\nthe poignant American\nmelodies of the second\nmovement, \u2018Largo\u2019, are\nrendered beautifully by\nthe woodwind section.\nThe dance-like third\nmovement, \u2018Scherzo\u2019, is\ninfluenced by Longfellow\u2019s poem \u2018The Song of\nHiawatha\u2019, with Dvorak\u2019s\nsignature rhythmic\ndrive. Finally, Dvorak\u2019s\nconservative Brahmsian\nstyle transforms to a more\nexperimentalist Wagner\nstyle by the finale. Repeating motifs adopted\ninto different forms and\nplayed by different instruments showcased both the\nsimplicity and versatility\nof an extended theme.\nThe RPO pulled off a\nstunning performance of\nDvorak\u2019s symphony. They\ntruly breathed together,\nwith nary a single note out\nof place. Each orchestral\nsection moved and functioned as one, with all the\nsections working together\nin perfect synchrony\nto completely take the\naudience into a new world,\none filled with fascinating\ncolours and delightful\nmelodies that took your\nbreath away. The standing\novation they received was\nwell-deserved, and was\na perfect end to a most\nenjoyable evening.\nThat walk you do when you\u2019ve just bowled a strike // RPO\nMUSIC\nElizabeth Thong\nMusic Writer\nVenue: Cadogan Hall. Date:\n28th\nFebruary 2019. Ticket\nPrice: From \u00a315.\nROYAL PHILHARMONIC\nORCHESTRA\n\n"

I thoroughly\nenjoyed the debate and\nI want to massively\ncommend Felix Comment\nEditor and social boi,\nCharlie Titmuss, and my\nguy DH and his ICTV\nteam, for their remarkably\nsmooth running of the\nevent. The debates were\na fantastic opportunity to\nmeet the candidates and I\nencourage all students and\nvoters to watch online to\nbetter make an informed\ndecision.\nNaturally, I was most\ninvestedintheFelixEditor\nrole, providing punditry\nfollowing the debate.\nThe biggest challenge\nfacing the next Editor is\nrecruitment. As I\u2019ve said\nmany times, Felix would\nbe nothing without the\namazing Editorial team,\nwho volunteer their time\nto make my job (and life)\neasier. The role of Felix\nEditor is unlike any other\nsabbatical role in that the\nEditordirectlyleadssucha\nlarge team and, therefore,\na huge aspect of the position is related to the social\nside of club Felix and\nkeeping the team morale\nhigh. Unfortunately for\nmy successor, quite a few\ncore members of the Felix\nfamily are moving on to\npastures new. Drawing\non my favourite analogy\nagain, much like Sir Alex\nFerguson in 2013, I\u2019m\nleaving behind an ageing\nsquad and it will be up to\nthe next Editor to embark\non an aggressive recruiting campaign to ensure\n2\nthat their year in the role\nresembles Ole Gunnar\nSolskjaer\u2019s magical tenure\nand doesn\u2019t resemble\nthe disastrous tenures of\nDavid Moyes, Louis Van\nGaal and Jose Mourinho.\nSpeaking of Man\nUnited, I\u2019m going to use\nthe rest of this Editorial to\nwax lyrical about our glorious comeback aggregate\nvictory. I retract all of the\nbullshit I wrote in my 15th\nFebruary Editorial following the first-leg defeat.\nThe honeymoon period\nrolls on and it would be\na disgrace, a tragedy and\nalmost a case for national\nemergency if Ole Gunnar\nSolskjaer isn\u2019t offered\nthe permanent managerial role now. Anyone\naround the Media Hub on\nWednesday night would\nhave heard my screaming\nand raucous applause - I\u2019ll\nbe (illegally) streaming\nthe rest of United\u2019s\nChampions League campaign from the office and\noperating an open door\npolicy so come down and\nwitness history! #GGMU\nFor those of you saying,\n\u201cbut Andy, I thought you\ndon\u2019t watch football?\u201d...\ndon\u2019t watch init.

After the disaster\nwhich was submitting\nthe last 2 issues of Felix\n(don\u2019t even ask what time\nI left the office last week),\nI\u2019m currently writing this\nEditorial earlier than I\u2019ve\never written it and the\npaper will be submitted\nas early as it\u2019s ever been.\nMy performance clearly\nsubconsciously mirrors\nthat of my team.\nSection of the week\ngoes to the Comment\nSection.

These allow the learner to\ninteract with the concept, understand the underlying\nmathematics and see how they apply to their particular\nlearning. The project is now expanding to other departments and will be implemented more widely in learning\nof key concepts in subjects- As one recent student\npartner on the project noted:\n\u201cAs I had just finished first year myself, I felt I had a\ngood idea of the areas that could be supplemented by a\nvisualisation\u201d\nThe project continues this year with further StudentShapers opportunities available.\nFeatured project: Imperial MedSTEP\nLast summer staff in the Faculty of Medicine partnered with year 1 and 2 students to develop the \u2018Self\nTests for Exam Preparation\u2019 platform. By engaging\nwith students the design of the online portal particularly\nsuited the way students study and prepare for exams\nand how questions could be designed, whilst the staff\npartner ensured the content was clearly linked to the\ncurriculum and matched to module learning objectives.\nOne of the student partners within the team commented:\n\u201cThe implementation of weekly group gathering\n(round table) helped improve my capacity to receive\nand give criticism in a professional manner, which\nundoubtedly improved my teamwork skills\u201d\nThe project continues this year with further StudentShapers opportunities available.\n\n"

Yet very few who aren't on Council go,\nand even fewer bring their ideas for discussion.Having\ntaken up committee positions previously I learned there\nare often better suggestions you should listen to, and\nmore steps to carry them into tangible outcomes. I will\nwork to provide:\n\u2022 A welcoming environment - Anyone may attend Council\n\u2022 A more enlightened view of Council proceedings - Ensuring all members act\nin the best interests of the students they represent\n\u2022 A starting platform - To help anyone with an idea\n\u2022 A more time efficient council.\nI'm not saying I have solutions to all problems; however, I am dedicated to listening to you to change your Union for the better, one step at a time. I want to be here\nfor everyone, for those who need assistance to get their voices heard. The Union\nis great, we have so much choice in activities, so much help, but you know that it\ncan be so much more. And while I may not have all the suggestions, I know that\nyou do.

However in the four years\nI've attended Council meetings, I've seen it consistently\nfail to live up to this potential. Instead, it gets bogged\ndown in technical discussions about constitutions and\nstanding orders, and rubber stamping of sabbatical of-ficers' reports on what they've been doing. The training\nfor Council members could go much further, and often\nimportant policy decisions inappropriately bypass Council altogether. I'm deeply\nfrustrated by these failings. So I propose to:\n\u2022 Require sabbatical reports to describe planned future activities for Council to\nscrutinise.\n\u2022 Provide comprehensive training documentation for new members explaining\nkey Council procedures.\n\u2022 Mandate existing Council subcommittees (for Education, Welfare and Clubs)\nto formulate policy proposals to provide Council with more business of sub-stance.\n\u2022 Develop clear procedures to take complex/bureaucratic matters outside of\nmeetings.\n\u2022 Ensure that all policies due for renewal are examined and revised in plenty of\ntime for scrutiny before expiring.\nMy experience:\n\u2022 Involved with Council since 2015.\n\u2022 Previous roles: RCSU President, PhySoc President, both Physics UG and PG\nDep Rep.\nLobbied for:\n\u2022 Ending the zero-tolerance policy on late work submission.\n\u2022 Improved representation for Postgraduate students\n\u2022 Union role representing economically disadvantaged students.\nSo vote Lloyd for a Union Council that is a vehicle for real, positive change for\nstudents.\nT\nhe Union Council is our student decision-making body within the Union,\nbut only a handful of students are aware of what goes on and how the\nUnion improves student life. Your voice matters and I believe we can\nensure that Imperial College London always listens to and acts on student\nfeedback in order to make it number 1 globally. As a currently Elected Imperial\nHorizon Representative, I am working hard to improve the language courses taught\nat Imperial. My aspiration is for every student to leave Imperial with an additional\nlanguage as well as having strong analytical skills. If elected, I will work for:\n\u2022 An online ideas platform. I will work with the college to create a platform\nwhereby societies can collaborate on how the Union can help societies.\n\u2022 Strong communication. I will provide a strong student voice on the Trustee\nBoard to ensure that students are always getting the best opportunities here at\nImperial and will work alongside the treasurer to increase funding for societies.\n\u2022 Increased International Opportunities. I will work with international universities to facilitate for more summer research opportunities for undergraduates\nand increased funding for summer schools in Europe, Asia and the Middle\nEast\nThe past two years have been a challenging yet rewarding part of my life and I\nwant to make sure you, whether you are a fresher or a final year, have the support\nto thrive and enjoy your time at Imperial College London.\nMaurice Yap\nI\nam quite comfy to sit on, therefore I'd be a very\ngood chair.\nAbdirahman Ismail\nNo image or manifesto provided\nDavide Vaccaro\n\n"

Laden with\ninnuendo, the storyline\nbecomes increasingly\nridiculous, with everyone\nfrom nosy neighbours to\nloud snorers getting in the\nway of the couple having\nany privacy at all...\nWhat could have been\na truly cringe-worthy\nexperience was rendered\noutright funny. Rohan\nMitta played a suitably\nawkward and troubled\nArthur, making an endearingly naive couple with\nhis new wife Violet, brilliantly played by Maddie\nRoche.\nArthur\u2019s ever-present\nparents, played by Olivia\nRevans and Christian\nBurton, made a brilliant\npair, authentically setting\nthe scene in mid-20th\ncentury Bolton. This\nwas further impressed\non the audience through\na fantastic set, designed\nby Thomas Allen, which\ngave the audience a prime\nview into the bedroom,\nremoving any sense\nthat the couple had any\nprivacy at all.\nA stellar performance\ncame from Calum\nDrysdale, who played\na charismatic Geoffrey\nFritton, and a special\nmention to Georgie Davis\nas a brilliantly funny\nMolly Thompson.

Following\nthe devastating attacks\non September 11th\n2001\nthat resulted in the deaths\nof almost 3000 people,\nAmerican airspace was\nshut; this resulted in 38\nplanes carrying nearly\n7000 passengers to be\ndiverted to a small town\nin Canada called Gander,\nwhose population size\nwas to suddenly double.\nThe locals embrace the\nnewcomers, providing\nfood, shelter and clothes,\nwhile forging unique\nbonds in the face of their\nunique situation.\nWhat makes the show\nthe emotional juggernaut\nthat it is isn\u2019t simply\nits setting but also the\nway the show brilliantly\nexplores the intricate ways\neach character is affected\nby the events that lead to\ntheir current situation; a\nMuslim passenger constantly being subject to\njudgemental looks and a\nthorough full body search,\na mother desperately\nwaiting to hear from her\nson who is a firefighter in\nNew York City, as well as\na pregnant chimpanzee!\nThe themes of hope,\ndesperation, grief and\nlove are touched on beautifully through a score\nthat is catchy, consistent\nand touching throughout.\nHaving been familiar with\nthe music prior to seeing\nthe show, it wouldn\u2019t be\nout of line to say that the\nmusic, which is brilliant in\nits own right, is elevated\nby the staging.\nCome From Away is\na true company musical,\nwith 12 cast members\nalternating from roles as\nGander locals to roles\nas \u201cthe plane people\u201d.\nAlthough at first, I\nthought this would get\nconfusing or tedious, this\napproach works miraculously well, as with the\naddition of a hat or a coat,\nthe characters transform\ninto completely different\npeople in the blink of an\neye. Although this can\nin part be attributed to\nthe acting abilities of the\nindividual cast members,\nthe direction deserves\nsome of the credit in\nmaking this as seamless\nas it is. The show is so\nslick and looks so simple\nthat it is easy to overlook\nthe level of complexity of\nsuch in-sync scene and\ncharacter transitions.\nAlthough it is extremely hard to choose standout\ncast members, Rachel\nTucker, whose roles\ninclude Beverly Bass,\nthe first female captain at\nAmerican Airlines, who\npiloted one of the planes\nlanding at Gander, gets\nto perform the show\u2019s\nonly solo number, an\nemotional piece exploring\nBass\u2019s passion for flying,\nand her feelings towards\nwhat has taken place.\nTucker performs the piece\nbeautifully, and the scene\nworks wonderfully as one\nof the emotional climaxes\nof the show.\nA one-act show just\nshort of two hours, Come\nFrom Away is able to say\nall it needs to say without\ndiluting the message with\nunnecessary sequences,\nor a break to take away\nfrom the intensity of the\nperformance. This is not\nonly a show that reflects\non the events on 9/11,\nbut one that is as relevant\nas ever in these divisive\ntimes.\nNobody wants to consummate their marriage in their childhood bedroom // DramSoc\nARTS\nOzbil Dumenci\nArts Writer\nWhere?

I've seen first-hand\nhow far-reaching changes to our degrees can be made\nwithout consulting students, or even academic staff.\nThe Union behaves similarly, with bureaucratic hurdles\nmaking engagement difficult, and students excluded\nfrom decision-making.This needs to change. I believe\ntogether, we can:\nFIX THE UNION:\n\u2022 Pay student staff the London Living Wage, in\nline with other London universities\n\u2022 Get the room-booking system automated- Resist\nproposed cuts to Reynolds bar\n\u2022 Improve transparency: keep students informed\nregarding major decisions\nCHALLENGE THE UNIVERSITY:\n\u2022 Take a stand against cuts to catering outlets (e.g.\nh-bar) and other student services\n\u2022 Fight for student space and a stronger counselling provision\n\u2022 End unethical investments\nMy plan to change Imperial is simple: increase\nstudent representation on high-level College commit-tees.

    "content": "ISSUE 1717\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12\nThe Ghost Map: dive into the 1854 London cholera\noutbreak\nT\nhe setting of this\nbook - a cholera outbreak\nin Victorian\nEngland revolving\naround cesspools con-taminations - is not\nparticularly the most\nattractive thing in the\nworld, yet it\u2019s fascinating to see the story\nbehind how we came to\nunderstand that cholera\nis water-borne, how it\nestablished the base\nof epidemiology, how\nthe public health and\ncity planning system\nevolved, and how it\nmade urban-living pos-sible. There are many\naspects to this cross-dis-ciplinary case study that\nit\u2019s difficult to string\nall my thoughts on it\ntogether.\nThe premise\nIt\u2019s 1854. Enter the\nthriving, rising city of\nLondon with 2.5 million\npeople in the cramped,\nunderdeveloped Elizabethan infrastructure.\nWith the population\nskyrocketing but\nwithout proper sewage\nsystem, residents at the\ntime simply discarded of their wastes in\ncesspool, and following\nThe Nuisances Removal\nand Diseases Prevention\nAct of 1846, into the\nriver. Miasma theorists\nconcluded that cholera\nwas air-borne, caused\nby \u201cmiasma\u201d particles\nspreading in air. Therefore legislations based\nupon that idea, originally\nmeant to stop the spread\nof infectious diseases,\nironically encouraged\nthe disease we now\nknow is water-borne.\nBy late August and\nearly September, the\ninfamous Broad Street\noutbreak occurred, with\nover 10% of the population dying in the span of\nseven days - giving way\nto physician John Snow\na chance to prove his\ngerm theory with raw\ndata.\nThe double-blind experiment and the data\ncollection\nNow looking back,\nit\u2019s absolutely impressive that Snow seized\nthe opportunity to\nutilize the event as an\nintersection between a\nnatural experiment and\nan observational study\nto examine possible\ncauses, since controlled\nexperimentation was\ncertainly not a viable\noption given technical\nlimitations and ethical\nconcerns. As with all\nobservational studies,\nobtaining accurate,\nreliable information\nrequired tremendous\neffort. Fortunately,\nSnow recruited the help\nof Henry Whitehead, a\nlocal curate with access\nto information otherwise\nunavailable to Snow.\nWhitehead had the\nadvantage of first hand\nexperiences with the\ncommunity members.\nAs a result, he was able\nto acquire a diverse set\nof data, which enabled\nhim to observe correlations between unusual\nfactors. From there\nSnow drew the ghost\nmap that shows clearly\nhow concentrated the\ncholera cases were\naround a single source\nthat is the contaminated\nwater pump. It\u2019s worth\npointing out that this\nfits into the framework\nof a double-blind ex-periment, as neither\nthe patients nor the\ninvestigators knew the\ntrue cause of cholera\nwas, thus eliminating\npotential biases. In a\ntraditional experiment,\nwater supplies might\nbe overlooked as a\npredictor, but in observational studies, all the\nconfounding factors\neventually steering clear\nand the true independent\nvariable eventually\ncoming to the surface.\nThis mode of collaboration sets the foundation\nfor modern day epide-miology, combining\ndemographic study and\nscientific data.\nHow faulty ideas persist despite evidence\nAn idea that had personally intrigued me and\nappeared many times\nthroughout Snow\u2019s investigation was how the\nMiasma theory persisted\ndespite the concrete\nevidence against\nit. Even before the\noutbreak in 1854, Snow\ngrew skeptical of the\ntheory, doubtful of how\nthe same doctor who\nattended the infected\npatients during the\ninfectious phase stayed\nfree of cholera. Yet its\nproponents remained\nfiercely for the mias-matic theory to a point\nwhere their confirmation\nCholera Map // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nJia Qi Tan\nBooks Writer\nbias \u201cblinded them to the\npatterns that Snow and\nWhitehead perceived so\nclearly\u201d. In an attempt\nto test Snow\u2019s findings,\nHall\u2019s team, the Board\nof Health Committee,\nfailed to examine the\nfactors resembling water\nconsumption patterns\nand instead focused on\nthose relating to miasma\nand sanitary conditions,\nwhich happened to be\nconfounding factors.\nThis is not the first\nstory of one theory\noverthrowing another,\nbut nevertheless the\ndifficulties involved\nshows how stubborn the\nscientific community\ncould be and the possibility of the right ideas\nout there waiting to be\nproven right.\nA glimpse into alcohol\nin preventing cholera\nAnother aspect that\nstood out to me was the\nrole alcohol played in the\nquest for the true cause\nof cholera. Historically,\nthe solution to combat\nthe lack of unpolluted\nwater was through\nconsumption of alcohol,\nas its antibacterial\nproperties helped fight\noff waterborne diseases\nlike dysentery. Before\nthe arrival of coffee and\ntea, beer and wine domesticated \u201cone microbial life-form in order to\ncounter the threat posed\nby other microbes.\u201d In\nmany instances in the\ninvestigation of cholera,\nalcohol found its way\nback to the stage and\nlater leading Snow to\nconclude that cholera\nwas caused by the\nbacteria Vibrio cholerae.\nThe effects\nConsider the effects\nof such an outbreak\n- not only the deaths,\nbut also the chaos and\nthe helplessness - and\nthe idea that perhaps\nhigh-density living\nis not feasible, that a\ncity may just collapse.\nTherefore identifying\nthe contamination as the\ncause of the outbreak\nand proving that cholera\nis waterborne gave\nmany a glimmer of hope\nand takes away that fear\nof urban-living.\nSome final thoughts\nHis writing paints a\nvivid picture of Dickensian London, summarizes well a multidisciplinary case without\noveremphasizing on any\naspect and adds colour to\na subject that could be a\nlittle dry otherwise. This\nstory, as author Steven\nJohnson puts it, of \u201ca\ndeadly bacterium, a vast\ncity, and two gifted but\nvery different men\u201d is\ncertainly a worthwhile\nread for those interested\nin learning a thing or\ntwo about history, statistics or public health.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1717\nFELIX\n9\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGrumpy Bastard\u2019s Elections\nThis week, Grumpy Bastard, writes about the student elections...\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nI\n\u2019m unsure how many\nof you are aware of\nthis but apparently\nvoting in the student\nelections opens at 12 am\ntoday. A keen follower of\nstudent politics myself, I\nam excited to find out just\nwho my representatives\nto the Union are going to\nbe. Despite several years\nwatching every single\nteam of sabbs accomplish\nalmost nothing of note\nduring their tenure, it is\nalways exciting to find\nout just how this next crop\nwill fuck up.\nI\u2019m especially excited\nto find out just how they\nwill waste all of the\n\u00a330000 being funnelled\ninto their pockets. Given\nthat they are mostly brain\ndead by the time they have\nfinished the role, I imagine\na significant proportion of\nit is spent on life support-although they clearly did\nnot invest enough to alow\nthe sabbs to breathe and\napprove payments at the\nsame time. That\u2019s what\nhappens when you have\nthe IQ of a small legume.\nHowever, I\u2019m getting\nahead of myself. At this\npoint in time, we have\nnot yet made the choice\nof which mindless clone\nwe\u2019re going to have in\nthe Union, or exactly how\nfar college will have an\narm up their arse telling\nthem exactly which way\nto yelp. No, we are still in\nthe sweet spot beforehand,\nwhere anything may yet\nbe possible. Campaigning\nbegan on Wednesday and\nalready I\u2019ve seen at least\n8 or 9 shit posters with a\npun on their name based\non the role they were\napplying for. In all honesty\nthe KGB probably had a\nbetter sense of humour.\nI\u2019m unsure if you\nwere unlucky enough\nto catch the Meet the\nCandidates debate, but let\nme assure you, I was an\navid viewer. ISIS haven\u2019t\nbeen releasing quite as\nmany execution videos\nas they used to and I was\nexcited for a recreation\nof Meet the Candidates\n2018. However, I was disappointed when the event\nproved to be remarkably\nwell put together and ran\nsemi-smoothly, despite\naudio issues and a host\nthat looked like Princess\nDiana immediately before\nshe went through the car\ndashboard. It was also\nweird that they let Edward\nSnowden commentate on\nthe sofa. I thought he was\nstill holed up in Moscow\nbeing choke-fucked by\nVadimir Putin. This year\u2019s\ncandidates at least seem\npromising; they made a\nlot of promises.\nHowever,itmaybethat,\nby roasting our student\nrepresentatives, I am\nmissing the point. Every\nyear, candidates promise\nmeaningful reform and\nchange, and yet every\nyear they completely\nfail to deliver. At present\nwe are witnessing a very\nreal reduction in services\noffered to students, with\ncuts to the food available\non campus and failures by\ncollege essentially going\nunpunished. Is it truly fair\nto blame the candidates,\nwho I genuinely believe,\ncross the Union threshold\non their first day with the\nbest of intentions? It\u2019s not\ntheir fault that the world of\ngraduate employment just\nwouldn\u2019t suit them at the\npresent time. The problem\nultimately lies with the\nUnion bureaucracy being\nrun not for the benefit of\nthe students at Imperial,\nbut to meet budgetary\ntargets set far in the past.\nThe fact that the sabbs are\nthere for me to fling shit at\nonly shields those that act\nbehind the scenes to fuck\neverything up. But I\u2019m\nnot here to offer solutions.\nI\u2019m just here to hate.\n\n"

    "content": "Don\u2019t call your country \u201cdeveloped\u201d\nI\ns the UK developed\nor developing?\nWhat about Vietnam\n- developed or\ndeveloping?\nThe World Bank no\nlonger uses the terms\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d or \u201cdeveloping\u201d and I couldn\u2019t agree\nmore. The distinction of\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d and \u201cdeveloping\u201d countries date to\nthe period just after the\nSecond World War, when\ninstitutions such as the\nUnited Nations (UN) and\nWorldBankwerefounded,\nwhich defined the terms.\nOne of the key objectives\nof these institutions was\nto drive development\nand reduce poverty with\nthe hope that this will\navert future catastrophic\nconflict. This was the time\nof the baby boom and\nwhen US, where these organizations are based, did\nnot question its position as\nthe world superpower. It\nwas the time before Silent\nSpring and the realization\nthat natural resources are\nbounded. This drive for\nglobalization has had a\nhuge impact on the world\nsince and undoubtedly has\nhad an immense success\nin improving the quality\nof human life in the past\nhalf century.\nAccording to GapMinder, life expectancy\nat birth in Vietnam was\nconsistently 30 years old\nbetween 1875 and 1939.\nToday it is 75, higher\nthan that of any country\nbefore the Second World\nWar and barely differs\nfrom that of the longest\nliving countries today.\nThe UK, for all its investment in healthcare, has\na life-expectancy of just\nsix years longer than that\nof Vietnam today. This is\nnot to say that healthcare\nis not far better in the UK\nthan Vietnam, but it highlights that development\nhas been such a success\nthat the gap between\nwealthy and poor nations\nin terms of fundamental\nhuman needs as a whole is\ndiminishing.\nOne of the reasons\nbehind the movement to\nglobalization by organizations such as the UN was\nthat trade makes countries\ninter-dependent and acts\nas a counterbalance to\nwar, a concern which was\nvery much on the minds\nof leaders at the time. In\ntheory, if one country goes\nto war with another, they\nhurt themselves in losing\ntrade with their opponent\nand any of their allies\nwhich decide to enforce\ntrade barriers.\nThis is just a sketch of\na complex and nuanced\npolitical and economic\ntheory, and not one which\nis the topic of this discussion - the question is\nnot whether global trade\nbetween \u201cdeveloping\u201d\nand \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries\ndoes or does not ensure\nglobal peace.\nThe question is thus\nwhether dividing the\nworld into \u201cdeveloping\u201d\nand \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries is meaningful and\nsecondly whether the development is sustainable.\nWhat is the difference\nbetween\u201cdeveloped\u201d\nand\u201cdeveloping\u201d?\nThe UN argues that\n\u201cthe designations \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019\nare intended for statistical\nconvenience and do not\nnecessarily express a\njudgement about the stage\nreached by a particular\ncountry or area in the\ndevelopment process\u201d.\nHowever it admits that\n\u201cthere is no established\nconvention for the designation of \u2018developed\u2019 and\n\u2018developing\u2019 countries\nor areas in the United\nNations system\u201d.\nWhy is it that the terms\n\u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cwealthy\u201d do\nnot suffice? Why do we\ntalk of \u201cdeveloped\u201d versus\n\u201cdeveloping\u201d - which only\nreplaced the similarly\nloaded terms \u201cfirst world\u201d\nand \u201cthird world\u201d? It is\nbecause those in the \u201cfirst\nworld\u201d elected the terms.\nIn case you are wonder-ing, the \u201csecond world\u201d\ndisappeared with the fall\nof the USSR and the communist states which it was\nused to denote. The term\n\u201cdeveloping\u201d implies\nthat such countries will\neventually become like\nthe \u201cdeveloped\u201d ones\nwith sufficient fortune\nand good leadership.\nHowever, are societies of\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d consumerist\nsocieties really so first-rate as the language we\nuse implies?\nInevitably through\nhistorical or geographical\ncircumstances some\ncountries have fewer\nresources, less power or\nless developed industry\nthan others, and it is along\nthis distinction that the\ndivide of \u201cdeveloped\u201d and\n\u201cdeveloping\u201d are drawn.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 8TH\nMARCH, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nArtur Donaldson\nSustainability Editor\nThe IMF, another organization heavily involved in\ndevelopment, defines developing countries on the\ncriteria of \u201c(1) per capita\nincome level, (2) export\ndiversification ... and\n(3) degree of integration\ninto the global financial\nsystem\u201d. In other words,\nthe grade of development\nisbasedonmaterialwealth\nand power of individuals\n(in the first criteria) and of\nthe amount of global trade\na country engages in (the\nsecond and third criteria).\nIs development\nsustainable?\nWe all sense that more\nmaterial wealth, once\nabove a certain threshold,\nis weakly correlated with\nhappiness. What it does\ngive is power to decide\nwhat is produced within\nsociety. For instance\nindividuals can use\ntheir economic power to\nchoose electricity from a\nrenewable energy supplier\nand thus increase the\nproportion of electricity\ngeneration from renewable sources.\nBut economic power\nalso gives the ability to\ndo things which are not\nsustainable. Even I have\nbeen tempted to invest\nin the next generation\nphone or a flight abroad\neven though it is not a\nfundamental human need\nand I am well aware of the\ncarbon footprint.\nEven if we try to\navoid the temptation, the\nability to do something\nhas the subversive effect\nof reducing choice. For\ninstance, because smartphones are so cheap and\nreadily available it is\nexpected that everyone\nhas one. Even if we\nset aside the isolation\nfrom social contact by\nthis simple luddism\neven the most basic of\nservices such as banking,\nhealthcare or accessing\ngovernment will not work\nwithout. This unarguably\nmakes government more\nefficient and allows easier\naccess, but also relies on\ndevices made from resources with finite supply\nand huge social and\nenvironmental impacts\nin their production which\npresently are treated as\npretty disposable.\nThough levels of\nconsumption of natural\nresources by \u201cdeveloped\u201d\nnations per person aren\u2019t\nrising, they don\u2019t look\nset to fall to sustainable\nlevels. They are far higher\nthan that of the \u201cdeveloping\u201d nations where most\nof manufacturing and\nprimary production has\nbeen relocated. Alongside\nproviding for the wealthy\ncountries, developing\ncountries are showing a\nrapid rise in consumption.\nIf the entire world\u2019s\npopulation were to live\nas an average person in\na \u201cdeveloped\u201d country\nwe would need vastly\nmore resources than\ncan be foreseeably\nproduced. If development\nmeans becoming like\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d countries,\ndevelopment is a rather\nshort-sighted pursuit.\nRather than defining\ndevelopment on wealth,\nwhich there is a finite\nsupply of, there must\nbe something deeper to\ndefine the distinction on.\nWhat should this something be?\nI don\u2019t have the answer,\nbut my belief is that one\ncriterion is meaning.\nWhen something is expensive we find meaning\nin buying it - it is precious\nbecause we had to sacrifice having that thing over\nhaving something else.\nEqually we find meaning\nin work, in friendship, in\nunderstanding a scientific\ntheory, in solving a cross\nword puzzle, reading an\narticle in the newspaper.\nI don\u2019t think it would be\neasy to quantify such a\nthing as meaning as we\ndo with money and life\nexpectancy. Indeed I\ndon\u2019t know if it is quan-tifiable, but if it is then\nit is possibly the most\nlimitless resource. The\ncurrent metric by which\neconomies are measured\nare rather more correlated\nwith material wealth, a\nfinite resource, than is\nsensible.\nWe all want people\nto live meaningful lives,\nand we are aware that\nnot everyone has the\nopportunities that people\nin \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries.\nHowever, what if having\nthe wealth which those in\n\u201cdeveloped\u201d nations have\nis not healthy? What if we\nactually need to sacrifice\nsomething from our own\nlives so that we can live\nmore equally with others\non our planet?\nI don\u2019t have the\nanswers. I have only more\nquestions. I hope you\u2019d\nagree that we should\nquestion whether, from an\nenvironmental perspec-tive, \u201cdeveloped\u201d nations\nare really so developed.\n\u201cLife\nexpectancy\nin Vietnam\nwas 30 years\nbetween 1875\nand 1939.\nToday it is 75\nand barely\ndiffers from\nthat of the\nlongest living\ncountries\ntoday\u201d\nImplicitly labelling wealthy countries as the role model for development countries is a bad idea for humanity\n\u201cRather than\ndefining\ndevelopment\non wealth,\nwhich there is\na finite supply\nof, there must\nbe something\ndeeper to\ndefine the\ndistinction on\u201d\n\n"

Introduce new club\nnights with a range of drinks deals.\n\u2022 Sustainability: Run a 'Go Green' campaign, including lobbying the college to\nincrease dependency on renewable sources, reduce unethical investments, and\nreduce plastic waste across college.\n\u2022 Clubs and Societies: better training for club finances to access a variety of\npayment options, and supply transport for training, fixtures and national com-petitions, and accommodation for national competitions.\n\u2022 Food and Drink: Loyalty schemes for purchases at all bars/catering outlets.\nIntroduce a better variety of options across all food outlets, with regards to\nhealthy food as well as various dietary requirements.\n\u2022 Opportunities and Training: Improve first aid and mental first aid training\nacross college. More student consultation and involvement in decisions that\naffect YOU.

However, I've encountered\nissues that I feel strongly about and want to change.\nAIMS:\nSERVICES\n\u2022 Transparency: Increase communication with the\nstudent body to improve awareness of changes to\ncampus services.\n\u2022 Bars & Outlets: Develop a plan working WITH\nCollege to retain and improve student oriented services: keep Reynolds open,\nreinstate dinner service at h-bar and improve white city outlets, providing key\nimprovements for graduate and ICSM community spaces.\n\u2022 Night-time Food: Lobby college for increased availability of late night, hot\nprovisions.\n\u2022 Consultation: Find your food/drink preferences and deliver those options\nwhile working to keep prices student friendly.\n\u2022 Queuing: Implement a more efficient queuing system into the Union and\nMetric.\n\u2022 Welfare: Look into the introduction of short interval sleep facilities on campus.\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\u2022 Reducing Waste: Work with Greening Imperial to introduce incentives such as\ndiscounts for bringing your own containers to take food away and repurpose\nleftover food from campus services.\n\u2022 Recycling: Set up a crisp packaging collection point at Imperial and find an\nalternative to mixed material packaging to reduce plastic waste.\n\u2022 CSPsStreamline:Aid the implementation of the Sports Hub, with infographics\nto understand the monetary breakdown and improve eActivities functionality.\n\u2022 Training: Set up interactive flow charts to expedite your queries on finances\n(especially VAT!) and ensuring availability of drop-in sessions at convenient\ntimes.\nFull Manifesto: https://krystal4dpfs.wixsite.com/votekrystal\n#VoteKrystal #KrystalforDPFS\nRebecca\nElkington\nH\naving worked at 568 for almost two years\nand been social sec for a society, I am in a\nunique position to know how to maximise\nthe profitability of the bar and make sure\nmore funds are available for student services. I've also\nsat on a society committee for three years so really\nunderstand the challenges involved with society budget\nallocation and how the union handles sponsorship.\nThese experiences, plus so many more throughout my\nfour years here, have made it clear to me exactly what\nneeds to be done to make life better for the students of\nImperial.If I am elected as your DPFS I promise to:\n\u2022 Change the claims and budget approval processes to make it quicker and easier\n\u2022 Resist the proposed funding cuts to library cafe food and the proposed reduction in opening hours of Reynolds.\n\u2022 Improve the treatment of bar staff, including making sure they are paid the\nLondon living wage.\n\u2022 Push the college to prioritise environmental policy, including withdrawing\ninvestments in fossil fuel companies\n\u2022 Review and streamline costly services like Imperial Plus\nIn the past few years the revenue from Beit bar, h-bar and Reynolds has dropped\nsubstantially.

I will lead the union to suggest Uni to invite\nmore sponsors to provide different degrees of\nsmall scholarships, in return, the union can help them hold different forms of\njob fairs.\n3. Organizing more events can be held on campus for different groups to create\na more conducive environment for people of different beliefs and sexual\norientations to live and study, that, such as e-sports competitions, so that more\nstudents can enrich their spare time and find their own interests\n4. To submit a formal letter to suggest Uni and government to extend the duration\nof the student visa, so that more international students can feel the inclusive-ness of the school and the UK, and get more job opportunities\n5. To suggest Uni for more flexible options for failing grades. For example, if\nyou only failed in one exam, you may could get a merit or distinction if you\nhave an average final grade more than 60 or 70, but if you failed more than\none, that means you only can get a pass.\nGlaucia Da Conceicao Pereira\nNo image or manifesto provided\n\u2022 Lobbying to remove the \u00a395 Disabilities Advisory Service diagnosis cost\n\u2022 Fighting for subsidies to private therapy while counselling service waiting\ntimes reduce\n\u2022 Consulting you on and reviewing the provision of menstrual products around\nCollege\n\u2022 Expanding LGBT+ Ally Networks to all departments\nTo ensure the Union maximises its support for students, I will:\n\u2022 Reform wellbeing rep and liberation officer training to better equip volunteers\n\u2022 Work with the Felix editor to re-establish the Felix Welfare section, to give\nstudents an outlet and raise awareness about welfare topics\n\u2022 Investigate new pastoral systems for postgraduates, and ensure postgraduate\nrepresentation at all levels\nHaving worked closely with previous DPWs, I've seen how the introduction of\nthe Wellbeing Representation Network has transformed the role - the next DPW\nneeds to better work with this network to enact change.

He got\nhimself vaccinated after\nasking on Reddit how to\ndo so against the wishes\nof his anti-vax mother.\nIn his testimony, he attributed his mother\u2019s misinformation to anecdotal\nguidance from Facebook\nand church. His mother\nbelieves vaccines cause\nsevere side-effects such as\nautism or permanent brain\ndamage.\nefficacy of vaccines, disproving its link to autism,\nhow is there still room for\ndebate?\nsevere allergic reaction)\ninduced by a vaccine is 1\nin a 1,000,000. The risk\nof dying in a car crash,\nhowever, is 1 in 303.\nAnd before the measles\nvaccine was introduced,\nmeasles infected 4 million\nAmericans every year.\nThe arguments get\nmore complicated and difficult to rebuff from here.\nMost anti-vax parents\nrefuse to vaccinate their\nchild out of genuine\nconcern and suspicion\n- they believe the risk\nof vaccination is higher\nthan the risk of catching\na vaccine-preventable\ndisease. It\u2019s an easy\nmistake to make: there\nare a decreasing number\nof cases of vaccine-pre-ventable disease, making\ntheir threat seem small.\nBut of course, the only\nreason for this decrease is\nbecause vaccination rates\nhave, until recently, been\nincreasing. What people\naren\u2019t told, but should be,\nis the number of people\nwho would be infected\nwhen different population\npercentages are vaccinat-ed.\nWhether or not\nvaccines should be mandatory (with exemptions\nto immunocompromised\nindividuals and those\nat risk of anaphylactic\nshock) is yet another\ndebate. The financial cost\nof preventing disease is\nmuch less than that of\ntreating and recovering.\nThere is also the explanation of herd immunity,\nwhere infections cannot\nspread when a threshold\npercentage of the population is vaccinated, so even\nunvaccinated individuals\ncannot contract disease.\nThe crux is, whether a\ngovernment can infringe\non individual freedoms,\nmake health decisions for\neveryone, even if for the\npublic good. Furthermore,\nin order to be compulsory,\nthe government must be\nable to track the vaccination status of everyone,\nlikely through a database,\nwhich is yet another way\nthe government would\nirritate the anti-authority\nlibertarians. But, living\nin a democratic society\nhas been, and always will\nbe, an ultimate paradox of\nfreedom and sovereignty.\nYou give up the right to\ncertain freedoms (follow-ing the law) in exchange\nfor the benefits of living\nin a society.\na global conspiracy to\ndeliberately make people\nsick so that Big Pharma\ncan profit from treating\nthem. They ignore the scientific basis for vaccines\nbecause they\u2019re sure that\nBig Pharma tampers with\nstatistics and cherry-picks\ndata. I read a comment\nonline from a mother who\nwasn\u2019t going to vaccinate\nher son because she\nthought her doctor would\nignore her concern of vac-cine-induced side effects,\nand ridicule her for even\nconsidering the possibili-ty. It\u2019s no surprise people\nare unwilling to trust the\nhealth industry; they\u2019ve\nhad their fair share of\nscandals: the opioid crisis,\nBig Sugar\u2026\nI believe that improved\nscience communication\nand transparency is at\nthe core of halting the\nanti-vax movement.\nWhat links populism\nto this movement is a\ndeep-rooted distrust in\nthe government, suspicion\nof big corporations and\nestablishments, including\nscientists. Scientists\nshould stop underestimating their audience,\nbut also shouldn\u2019t scoff\nat the doubt in vaccines\nand expect anti-vaxxers\nto discover the flaws in\ntheir own argument. The\nsentiment that science\ncan only be understood\nand discussed by experts\nhas to be destroyed! It is\nthis very sentiment that\ninfuriates anti-vaxxers\nwhen their concerns are\nmet with jeers instead\nof proper, clear explana-tions. For all the scientific\npapers that anti-vaxx-ers reference that do\nsomehow show a causation between vaccines\nand other diseases, the\n\u201cHe got\nhimself\nvaccinated\nafter asking on\nReddit how to\ndo so against\nthe wishes of\nhis anti-vax\nmother\u201d\nI always dismissed\nthe anti-vax movement\nas another social media\nand populism fuelled\nphenomenon, but I never\nstopped to wonder why\nthis is still a topic under\ndiscussion. There is\noverwhelming research\nbacking the safety and\n\u201cI always\ndismissed\nthe anti-vax\nmovement\nas another\nsocial media\nand populism\nfuelled\nphenomenon\u201d\nBut before getting into\nthe more intricate argu-ments, a couple of quick\ncases against vaccinations\nand why they are unfound-ed. One common claim is\nthat, \u201cVaccines contain\nharmful chemicals such as\naluminum, mercury, and\nformaldehyde.\u201d These\nare, in truth, present in\nvaccines, but not in large\nenough amounts to be dan-gerous; children get more\nexposure to aluminum\nthrough breast milk than\nfrom vaccines. Another,\n\u201cAutism frequency has increased (in the US, 1 in 59\nchildren are on the autism\nspectrum) with the rise of\nvaccination rates.\u201d This\ncan be attributed to better\nand more accurate diagnosis of autism, not an actual\nrise in its occurrence.\nThese two observations\nare linked only through\na progression of modern\nmedicine; correlation\ndoes not equal to causa-tion. And lastly, \u201cvaccines\ncause severe side effects\nlike anaphylaxis.\u201d The\nrisk of anaphylaxis (a\nscientific community\nshould acknowledge the\nexistence of these articles,\nthen explain why they are\nnot credible: too small a\nsample size, conflict of\ninterest, unreliable source,\nfaulty methodology etc.\nSimply repeating to\nthem that there isn\u2019t any\ncorrelation without explaining the basis for the\nstatement, or discussing\ntheir erroneous sources\namongst only themselves,\nis not convincing.\nThere should also be\nmore information on\ngovernment websites\nexplaining vaccination\non a societal basis instead\nof only providing information for individuals.\nWe should also learn to\nweed out misinformation\ncampaigns based on\ndiscord and fear-mon-gering of the public and\nacknowledge that these\ngroups are separate from\nparents who act out of\ngenuine concern for their\nchild\u2019s health. Lastly, a\ncampaign of promotion\ninstead of suppression\nshould be pursued. Even\nif untrue information\nis being suppressed, it\nmakes anti-vaxxers to\nfeel even more alienated\nand that their opinion has\nbeen overlooked, and only\nserves to reinforce their\ndistrust in the government\nand in industry for controlling what they have\nthe freedom to say.\n\u201cMost anti-vax\nparents refuse\nto vaccinate\ntheir child out\nof genuine\nconcern and\nsuspicion -they believe\nthe risk of\nvaccination\nis higher\nthan the risk\nof catching\na vaccine-preventable\ndisease\u201d\nSo, who can we blame?\nThe health industry, for\none. There is a staunch\nbelief amongst a certain\nwing of anti-vaxxers in\n\u201cThe crux is\nwhether a\ngovernment\ncan infringe\non individual\nfreedoms\u201d\n\n"

Ultimate, available\nfor free to all players who\nbought the game before\nthe 31st of January. He instantly won the love of the\ncommunity as a close to\nmid-range character with\nsuch a smooth gameplay\nfeeling as well as unique\nnew abilities to offer.\nWith his teeth and\nleaves, Piranha Plant\nhas decent close-range\ncombat capability both on\nthe ground and in the air.\nIn particular, his side- and\nup-smash are both very\nfast and powerful with a\ngenerous hitbox, making\nit easy to hit your target\nout of the park. Then,\nwhen in the air, you can\ndo either his neutral to\nget nice safe damage or\nhis back-air to end them\nwith a fiery blast. Another\nnotable finisher is his\nup-throw, which will kill\nreliably above 150% if\nyou manage to grab an\nopponent wandering too\nclose.\nPiranha Plant is also\nfantastic for mid-range\ncombat, with his special\nabilities being able to dish\nout the damage from the\ncomfort of his pot.\nHis neutral is his\nPtooie, an attack you\ncan hold to blow out a\nspike ball above his head,\nwhich can be then thrown\non either side with a\ndirectional input. Difficult\nto use at first, but, if you\nhit an opponent it can kill\nthem from 100%!\nThen it\u2019s his side-spe-cial Poison Breath, a\ncharged attack where\nPiranha Plant spits out a\nthick nauseous cloud of\npoison in front of him,\nwhich won\u2019t stagger his\nopponents but will deal an\ninsane amount of damage\nif they stay in it.\nHis down option is\nthe Long-Stem Strike,\nanother charged attack\nwhere he extends his neck\nto perform a long-range\nbite to finish his enemies.\nFinally, his up-special\nis the Piranhacopter, an\neasily steerable recovery\ntool which can travel\nboth a great vertical and\nhorizontal distance.\nNow he may be new the\nroster, but Piranha Plant\nplayershavealreadyfound\nsome cheeky combos and\ntechniques with him. The\nfirst is a simple use of\nPtooie to ledge guard your\nopponent. If you position\nPiranha Plant just on the\nedge of the map hold\ndown your neutral-spe-cial, it will keep floating in\nthe air and block any high\nrecovery. Furthermore, if\nthey instead want to attack\nyou whilst climbing back\non the stage, you can drop\nthe spike ball and hit them\nback off-stage. Another\ngeneral technique is the\n\u2018Camouflage\u2019, a great\nway to confuse your\nopponent by hiding\nbehind the dense poison\nof your side-special to\nsurprise your enemy with\nan unseen attack, such as\nyour Long-Stem Strike.\nSo even if originally\nnobody even considered\nPiranha Plant to ever be a\nfighter for Smash, Sakurai\nhas impressed everyone\nby making a creative\nand well-designed char-acter. His overall decent\nmoveset brings him only\nup to mid-tier but his\nunique tools make him\nvery fun to play. I hence\nhighly suggest you join\nthe Plant Gang to slash\nand bite your way to\nvictory.\nSmash Corner-Rosalina & Luna, Fighting Stars\nT\nhis powerful duo\nfirst appeared in\n2010 as a mysterious character of\nSuperMarioGalaxyonthe\nWii. They are relatively\nnew to the series, having\nonly appeared once before\nin the Wii U version of the\ngame. While not being as\npowerful as her previous\niteration, there is still\nplenty of room to show\noff with this complex\n2-in-1 package.\nThe unique aspect of\nRosalina and Luma comes\nfrom Luma copying all\nof Rosalina\u2019s attacks.\nWhether Luma is close\n(by default) or far (after\nusing Luma shot, the\nneutral special) she will\nfunction as a second\ncharacter you can control.\nThis allows for amazing\nmix-ups and should be\npracticed a lot in order\nto maximise potential. A\ncommon way of utilising\nthis is sending out Luma,\nand then grabbing the\nopponent. Rather than\nthrowing the opponent,\ninstead, pummel them and\nonce they are released,\nthey will float towards\nLuma, if you use an up\nsmash at high percent this\nwill result in a kill.\nTheir up B \u2018Launch\nStar\u2019 is a useful yet\nexploitable recovery.\nAlthough it has a very\nlarge range, the trajectory\nit takes is not very ma-nipulatable and thus easy\nto predict and punish. Be\ncareful when using this as\nonce Rosalina is off-stage\nwithout a jump, she is at a\nmassive disadvantage due\nto her slow fall speed and\nlightweight, meaning she\nis very easy to kill.\nThe other two special\nmoves are quite situa-tional. Star Bits is their\nside B which shoots out a\nsmall cluster of stars from\nLuma. This has quite low\ndamage and no knockback\nso is only useful when\ntrying to stop the enemy\ngoing back to the ledge or\nif you want to jab lock the\nopponent. Gravitational\nPull is their down B which\nhas two uses: It pulls\nLuma back to Rosalina\nafter being fired out by\na Luma shot and it also\nabsorbs projectiles. This\nis very useful as it allows\neasier control of Luma, as\nwell as giving Rosalina\na good tool to deal with\nprojectile users.\nThe main strength of\nRosalina comes in her\npowerful aerial attacks,\nespecially up air. You can\nhit most of her aerials out\nof a throw, so a common\nplay is to up throw the\nopponent into a string\nof up airs. Hitting the\nopponent with Luma\u2019s\nup air (rather than Rosalina\u2019s) will cause far more\nknockback and damage\nand often leads to a K.O.\nThe key with Rosalina\nand Luma is to be patient.\nYou have enough tools to\nhelpgetyououtofpressure\n(gravitational pull is great\nagainst projectiles and all\nof Luma\u2019s attacks have a\nhuge amount of priority)\nmeaning that if you wait\nuntil the right moment\nto strike you will be able\nto massively punish the\nopponent.\nOverall, I would rank\nPeach\u2019s Daughter (we\nthink) solidly in mid-tier.\nAlthough this duo has\npowerful kill potential and\npunish game, the fact that\nthey are so light means\nthey can be knocked out\nfar too easily. Not only\nthis but if Luma sustains\nenough damage she can\nbe knocked out herself\nleaving Rosalina screwed\nas she loses most of what\nmakes her strong.\nIf you want to find out\nmore about how to play\nRosalina and Luma at a\nhigh level I recommend\nyou check out \u2018Falln\u2019 a\nprofessional player with\ndecent results.

It has been\nshown that most mental\nhealth problems develop\nby the age of 24 , and in\n2015-16 alone, 15,000\nfirst-year students at UK\nuniversities reported\nhaving a mental health\nproblem .\nApart from the obvious\nacademic pressures of\nstudying, students are\nsimultaneously battling\nthe atrocious financial\nstruggles of paying for\nrent, commuting and\nweekly groceries to get\nby (I dare not mention our\nhuge student loan debt!).\nFor those eager enough to\njoin Clubs & Societies, attending regular meetings,\nevents and training can\nbecome an overwhelming\nresponsibility. And to top\nthings off, many of us also\nstruggle with the emotional challenges of dealing\nwith relationship and\nfamily problems. Whilst\nthese are all pertinent\nissues to us as students,\nthere are still many people\nwho are oblivious to the\ncomplex challenges that\nwe face.\nThursday 7th\nMarch\n2019 marked \u2018University\nMental Health Day\u2019: a\nnational day to recognise\nstudent mental health\nand raise awareness. This\nyear\u2019s theme was the\npower of \u2018using your\nvoice\u2019 as a means of\naddressing the existing\ngaps in knowledge,\nmental health literacy and\nthe support available to\nstudents . Essentially the\nidea is for students and\nsupporters to use their\nvoices to shape the future.\nAs Mental Health\nOfficer, one of the main\ntasks I have been working\non behind the scenes this\nyear has been to create a\n\u2018Health and Wellbeing\nSurvey\u2019 for all students at\nImperial. The purpose of\nthe survey is to create a\nchannel of communication\nfor students to use their\nvoices and tell me what\nchanges they would like\nto see in the College. It\nalso allows me to pinpoint\nwhich areas of university\nlife need to be enriched,\nwhilst also identifying un-der-represented groups in\nthe College. By using the\nfeedback from the survey,\nI aim to devise effective\nstrategies to improve\noverall student mental\nhealth and wellbeing. It\ntherefore seemed fitting\nto launch the survey on\nUniversity Mental Health\nDay 2019 and give\nYOU the opportunity to\nuse your voice to enact\nchange. The link to the\nsurvey can be found on all\nImperial College Union\nsocial media channels and\nwill be sent through via\nnewsletter to all student\nemails. So what are you\nwaiting for?

The\nmargins are so small over\nsuch a short distance and\nit was incredible watching\nthe sprinters pushing\nthemselves to the limit in\nthe finals later on that day.\nAlso representing\nICXCAC on Friday was\nKate Olding, who ran\nreally well in the 800m\nheats and narrowly missed\nout (by half a second!)\non qualification for the\nsemi-finals the following\nday.\nThe rest of the team\nwas in action on Saturday,\nwith James Millett starting\nthe weekend strongly with\na great performance in the\n1500m heats, finishing in\na time of 4:04.\nWhat followed was an\naction-packed day, with\nan excellent set of results\nfor the team in both the\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s\n3000m heats \u2013 both Dani\nChattenton and Dan\nMulryan qualified for the\nfinals, while Stephanie\nHewitt smashed her PB by\na whole 11 seconds, finishing in a time of 10:42.\nDani also qualified\nfor the 1500m final,\nwhile Alex Mundell ran\nexcellently in her 1500m\nheat, leaving herself with\nplenty to build on as the\nseason progresses.\nIdan Gal-Shohet also\nperformed well in the high\njump, finishing with a best\njump of 6.21m.\nAfter a successful day\non the track (and long\njump pit!), we piled into\nDani\u2019s car and headed\nback to our accommoda-tion, where we spent the\nevening cooking together\nand catching up on the\nhighlights of the British\nIndoor Champs in Birmingham #onbrand.\nFor our finalists, it\nwas an early night and a\nnervous wait, while the\nrest of the team had the\nchance to sample Sheffield\u2019s renowned nightlife.\nSunday: finals day.\nAlways guaranteed to be\na day packed with drama\nand it didn\u2019t disappoint!\nThe first big race of\nthe day for Imperial was\nthe 3000m women\u2019s final,\nwhich Dani Chattenton\nentered as a strong favourite \u2013 she handled\nthe pressure like a pro,\noutlasting the rest of the\nfield to take gold in a time\nof 9:37!\nAn amazing achievement in itself, but could\nshe add to her medal haul\nlater that day in the 1500m\nfinal?\nWe would soon find\nout, but first we had Dan\nMulryan in the men\u2019s\n3000m final.

We\ntravelled to the Chargers\u2019\nhome grounds in\nCanterbury to battle it out.\nThe maths was simple:\nwin and stay on in Div 1 or\nlose and potentially face\nrelegation. This meant\nthat Canterbury was now\nbacked up against a wall\nand we were expecting a\ntough game, unlike last\nweek.\nThe Chargers won the\ncoin toss and decided\nto defer, so they kicked\noff the ball to set up our\noffence to start the game.\nWe got a few first downs\nbut ultimately had to\npunt the ball away to\nCanterbury. As in our last\ngame our defence, led by\nThomas \u201cCheerleader\u201d\nSmith, completely stifled\ntheir offence and forced\na three-and-out that saw\nthem net negative yards.\nThe punt was quite short\nas well, leaving us at their\n45 yard line.\nUnfortunately we\ncouldn\u2019t muster anything,\nbut the special teams\nexcelled on the punt,\npinning them on their 1\nyard line.\nAll the defensive\nplayers were licking their\nchops at this point and\nsure enough the QB got\nsacked for safety on an\noutside lead. The score\nwas now 0-2 in favour\nof the Immortals and the\nChargers had to punt us\nthe ball. We immediately capitalised with a\ntouchdown of our own\nwith Killian \u201cOmelette\u201d\nGmyrek catching the two-point conversion, leaving\nus with a sizeable lead at\n0-10.\nHowever, a broken\nplay on defence lead to a\n\u201cIn fitting\nfashion we\nreturned to\nour famous\nQB sneak, and\nBen redeemed\nhimself by\nbringing it to\nthe house.\u201d\nChargers touchdown with\na pass netting 65 yards\non 3rd and 10, due to a\ncouple of missed tackles.\nYet Canterbury failed\nto get the ensuing two-point conversion, putting\nthem 6-10 back.\nThe score remained\nunchanged at the half,\ndespite the Chargers\u2019\nadmirable red zone\ndefence culminating in\nan interception in the end\nzone, just as the clock was\nwinding down on the last\nplay of the half.\nThe story was quite different in the second half.\nInitially, both teams\ntraded punts, until Ben\n\u201cBootleg God\u201d O\u2019Brien\nthrew an unfortunate pick\nsix, that gave the Chargers\ntheir first lead of the afternoon at 14-10.\nTwice after that the Immortals managed to reach\nthe foot of the end zone,\nbut failed to capitalise\nagainst a unyielding Canterbury defensive unit.\nHowever, the second\nof those attempts left the\nChargers at their 2 yard\nline and of course, our\nrookie Marcin \u201cSad Boie\u201d\nOlesinski managed to\ntackle the running back\nin the end zone to get us\na safety with only three-shot at getting a touchdown and winning the\ngame. Slowly but surely\nwe gained ground on\nthe Chargers thanks to\npowerful running by Jonas\n\u201cHe Won\u2019t Go Down\u201d\nEschenfelder, earning us\na first down inside the\nChargers 10 yard line.\nUnfortunately we\ncouldn\u2019t get anything\ngoing on the first two\ndowns. Then a quick out\nroute left us just inside the\n3 yard line with one final\nattempt to reach the end\nzone.\nIn fitting fashion we\nreturned to our famous\nQB sneak, which we had\nnot used all game, and\nBen redeemed himself by\nbringing it to the house.\nWith the score now\n14-18 in our favour we\nhad just under a minute\nleft to play.\nThis left the Chargers\nwith only four attempts\nto complete a deep ball\nfor a touchdown to win\nthe game. Thankfully our\ncoverage was on point and\nthe game ended on that\nscore line.\nThe last match of the\nseason also means additional traditions for the\nImmortals, such as the\nleavers tunnel where we\ncelebrate our soon-to-be\ngraduates who are now\nbecoming Mortals with a\nfinal ovation.\nThe season might be\nover, but we need to keep\nbuilding for next season.\nIf you are interested\nin playing American\nFootball, we will be\nhaving various flag\nfootball events throughout\nthe rest of the year.

A primer: the\nbursary entitlement for\nlow-income students has\nchanged several times\nover the last few years.\nThe UG cohort entering\nImperial in 2015 noticed\nthat those in the \u00a335,000\u00a360,000 income\nbrackets received\nsubstantially less \u2013 by\nnearly \u00a32000 a year in\nsome cases \u2013 than they\nwould have received\nhad they enrolled a year\nearlier under the 2014-entry bursary scheme.\nAnalysis by Imperial\nCollege Union showed\nthat students in these\n\u201csqueezed middle\u201d\nbrackets were now\nfalling below College\u2019s\nestimate for the cost of\nliving in London as a\nresult. A total overhaul\nof the bursary structure\nfollowed, to ensure that\nevery bursary recipient\ncould \u2013 through a combination of maintenance\nloans, bursaries, and\nfamily contributions \u2013\nafford to live and study\nin Imperial. From 2016\nonwards, students in\nthese middle-income\nbrackets would again\nreceive several thousands more per year than\nthey would under the\n2015 bursary scheme,\nand in theory everyone\ncould afford to study at\nImperial \u2013 hurray!\nThe problem was\nfixed, then \u2013 so what?\nWell, not quite. The\ncatch is that the changes\nwere not retrospective;\nonce you\u2019re on a particular bursary scheme, you\nstay on it (provided your\nhousehold income continues to fall below the\nthreshold). This means\nthat those students who\nsigned on the dotted line\nin 2015 as incoming\nfreshers have continued\nto be short-changed for\nthe duration of their\ndegrees. Many of those\naffected graduated last\nyear, and most of the rest\n\u2013 including me \u2013 will\ngraduate in 3 months\u2019\ntime, often having\nreceived in the region of\n\u00a38000-\u00a310,000 less over\nthe course of the degree\nthan students a year\nolder or younger.\nThis is not a small\namount of money, even\nto those in the higher\nbrackets of the bursary\nscheme. Bursary recipients comprise the bottom\nthird of home students\nby household income.\nFor reference, a household of two Imperial\ngraduates would expect\nto be bringing in close\nto \u00a375,000 only 12\nmonths after graduating,\nway above even the top\nbursary bracket (and\nover double the lowest\nhousehold income of\nthose affected).\nLet\u2019s estimate how\nmuch money this would\nhave cost Imperial to\naddress. There were\naround 160 affected\nstudents when I brought\nthis issue to the university\u2019s attention over\ntwo years ago in a\nAlternatively, the\naffected students could\nhave been shifted onto\nthe previous 2014\nbursary scheme. This\nwould be a cheaper\noption, with the biggest\ncut in the 2015 scheme\ncompared to its predecessor being around\n\u00a31900 a year (this time\nfor those in the \u00a340,000\u00a345,000 income\nbracket). A more modest\n\u00a3300,000 or so would\nbe enough to cover this.\nOf course, these are all\nupper bounds for the\ncost of rectifying the sit-uation; in reality, most\nstudents would stand to\nreceive less than this,\nand the cost to College\nwould be a lot lower.\nI hoped that my\nCouncil paper would\ndraw the attention of\nCollege management\nto what I assumed was\nan honest error in their\ncalculations, something\nthat had been overlooked\nby people with the best\nof intentions. I hoped\nthat we\u2019d ultimately\nreceive a bursary in line\nwith College\u2019s cost of\nliving calculations; at\nthe very least, I hoped\nit would be the start of\na conversation between\nCollege and the affected\nstudents.\nWhat followed instead\nwas a tersely-worded\ndismissal, followed by\ntwo and a half years of\u2026\nnothing. I thought that\nperhaps College would\nreach out to those of us\naffected, either directly\n\u2013 they knew who they\nwere paying, after all \u2013\nor through the Union.\nSadly, this never came. I\nchased it up initially but\nmy initial hopefulness\nwas steadily diminished\nImperial should offer White City bursaries // Imperial College London\n\u201cStudents\nwill graduate\nhaving\nreceived\n\u00a38000-\u00a310,000\nless than those\na year older or\nyounger\u201d\nUnion Council paper.\nWith the advent of the\nnew scheme in 2016,\nstudents in the \u00a345,000\u00a350,000 income bracket\nwould receive \u00a33100\nmore per year than those\nin the 2015 scheme.\nIf every one of the\naffected students was\nin this bracket, it would\ncost College around\n\u00a3500,000 a year to fix\nthe problem. A pretty\nserious sum of money,\nthen, but remember that\nthe 2016 scheme is the\none devised by College\nthemselves to ensure\nthat every bursary recipient could afford to live\nin London.\nISSUE 1717\nFELIX\n7\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nby each hurried meeting\nand vague promise. Like\nmost students who were\naffected, I eventually\nabandoned all hope that\nthere would ever be a\nresolution.\n*\nThat\u2019s where we were\nuntil January 2019, when\nFelix reported on a new\ndevelopment in the saga:\nover two years since\ntheir original clipped\nresponse, and with a\nchunk of the affected\nstudents having already\ngraduated, College have\npledged a cash bung of\n\u00a3250,000 to put things\nright.\nGreat news, if a little\nbelated \u2013 but there\u2019s\na caveat. Rather than\nbeing given freely to\naffected students, in the\nsame way as the bursary\nitself, this new money\nwill go towards funding\nexclusive \u201cspecific\nopportunities\u201d \u2013 namely\nUROPs, medical elec-tives, and a bespoke\ncareers package from\nthe Careers service.\nIt\u2019s hard to understand\nthe rationale behind this\ndecision. If College\nwere concerned about\nthe situation all along,\nwhy not say so? Why\nreflexively dismiss the\nissue outright two years\nago, when there was still\ntime to do something\nmeaningful about it?\nAnd why insist that the\nmoney be worked for,\nin the form of UROPs\nor medical electives,\nwhen the whole point of\na bursary is to remove\nthe burden of having to\nperform extra work to\nget by?\nYou\u2019d be forgiven for\nthinking that College\nwere hedging their bets\nfor two years, patiently\nwaiting for the last\nof the 2015 cohort to\ngraduate before burying\nthe issue forever. A\npretty cynical tactic,\nbut it was working \u2013 the\nissue had all but died in\nthe student body, and\nsoon enough everyone\nwho ever remembered it\nwould be long gone. But\nfrom the jaws of victory,\nCollege instead snatched\na mealy-mouthed mea\nculpa.\nI can think of a couple\nof ways this may have\ncome about. The first\nwould be the emergence\nof a split at the top of\nCollege between those\nwho (rightly) think that\nCollege\u2019s responsibility\ntowards some of its\npoorest students has\nbeen neglected in this\ninstance, and those who\n(also rightly) worry\nabout the PR implications of stirring the\nhornet\u2019s nest at this late\nstage and would prefer\nto continue playing\nthe waiting game.\nSuch a split would\nexplain some of the less\nthought-through aspects\nof the proposal; take, for\ninstance, the decision\nto fund UROPs for\nstudents who are mostly\nabout to graduate, many\nof whom will soon be\nwithout a place to live\nin London and who\n(by virtue of being\nfinal-year students) are\nunable even to apply for\nsummer accommodation\nin halls at student prices.\nWhat\u2019s more, students\nwere informed of this opportunity in a joint email\nfrom the Provost, the\nUnion President, and the\nDPW, sent on the 18th of\nFebruary. The deadline\nto submit the 1000-word\napplication form was\nthe 28th of February,\ngiving students ten\ndays to identify a novel\nresearch topic, approach\npotential supervisors,\nassess whether they\nwould be able to find\naccommodation over the\nsummer, and agree on\na provisional timeline\nwith their supervisor. I\nsuspect that I don\u2019t have\nto explain the implausibility of this, especially\nfor the ever-frantic\nfinal-year students.\nWhat troubles me\nmore is the notion that\nthis is instead a last-gasp attempt to control a\nnarrative. In the silence\nfollowing College\u2019s\ninitial response in 2016,\nthose who were aware\nof the situation grew\ndisenchanted with the\nuniversity\u2019s reticence\nto engage. Discontent\namong staff has been a\ntinderbox for a while;\nlast year\u2019s pension\ndispute provided the\nnecessary match for it to\nignite in unprecedented\nindustrial action. In\nbreaking their silence\non the lingering bursary\nissue at this late stage,\nCollege may have been\nhoping to sweeten their\nimage in the minds of\ngraduating students\n\u2013 students who will\nshortly be filling in the\ndreaded NSS; and if\nthey happen to soften\nthe resolve of the more\nmilitant staff members\nin the process, so much\nthe better for them.\n*\nfirst place? College will\ncorrectly say that there\nwere probably various\nlegal impediments to\nfixing the issue; that\nthe access agreement is\ndrafted years in advance;\nthat the Union agreed to\nthe changes in the first\nplace, so that students\nthemselves are partly to\nblame. These arguments\nare all fair and true; they\nare also all undermined\nby the fact that College\neventually managed to\nfind \u00a3250,000 down the\nback of the sofa at the\neleventh hour.\nCouldn\u2019t College have\nfixed this issue years\nago, then? Would it have\nbankrupted the country\nor, worse, the universi-ty? I can\u2019t answer these\nquestions because, fortunately for all involved\n(not least myself), I\nam not in charge of the\nuniversity finances.\nBefore finishing though,\nI\u2019d like to highlight a\nfew things that may help\nyou come to your own\nconclusions.\nIn 2017, Imperial\nhad by far the highest\nexpenditure on senior\nmanagement pay in\nthe UK (as reported\nin Felix 1688), with\neach of the 20 \u201cKey\nManagement Personnel\u201d\nearning, on average,\naround \u00a3280,000 \u2013 for\na grand total of over\n\u00a35.6million. The next\nhighest was Southampton at \u00a33.7million,\nnearly \u00a32million (or 4\ntimes \u00a3500,000) less.\nImperial\u2019s president,\nProf. Alice Gast, earned\n\u00a3433,000 alone last\nyear, and she wasn\u2019t\neven the College\u2019s\nhighest earner; this is\nseparate to the \u00a3300,000\nshe receives from\nChevron for her work as\none of its non-executive\ndirectors, as recently\ndisclosed in an email to\nall staff. \u00a3500,000 to fix\nthe low-income bursary,\nthen: a stretch too far?\nTo adapt a well-worn\nclich\u00e9: it\u2019s not about the\nsize of the budget, it\u2019s\nabout how you use it.\nMetric bursaries? // Imperial College London\n\u201dImperial\nspends \u00a35.6\nmillion on\u2018Key\nManagement\nPersonnel\u2019.\n\u00a3500,000\nwould fix the\nlow income\nbursary\u201d\nwould be a shame for\nthe money not to be used\ngiven the above. But\none question remains:\nwhat went wrong in the\nSo much for the\nfactors involved in\ngetting us here; regard-less, here is where we\nare, and so I would urge\nother affected students\nto take advantage of\nCollege\u2019s latest offerings if they can \u2013 it\n\n"

Just ask\nanyone who has been\nabout the energy or the\nvibe, and they\u2019ll tell you.\nBut be prepared for a long,\nmeandering monologue of\ninexplicable details that\nwill never compare to the\njoy of experiencing it for\nyourself. Named after the\nsea turtles that populate\nits coastlines, Boipeba is\na paradise of ecological\ndiversity. Home to rich\nAtlantic rainforest ripe\nfor inland hiking trails,\nsecluded beach spots\nframed by boulders and\nswaying palms, and a\nmassive mangrove forest\nbest navigated by kayak,\nthe island has plenty to\nkeep you entertained for\na sleepy yet action-packed\nBrazilian getaway. Oh,\nand the coast is also sprinkled with natural pools\nboasting colourful corals\nand marine life, when you\nneed to escape that intense\nmidday heat. While that\nmight sound like any other\nisland paradise, there are a\nfew standout features that\nmake Boipeba a unique\ngem within Brazil. For\nstarters, you can leave any\nsafety concerns back at the\nmainland docks. Although\nthe nation has seen a surge\nin crime in recent years,\nthe island is composed of\nsmall villages in which\neveryone knows every-one, and visitors are free\nto walk through the night\nand day, comfortably\ncarrying phones, cameras,\nand cash \u2013 a luxury that\ncannot be said about\nthe mainland. While the\nchildren of the west have\nbeen relegated to dark\nrooms and smartphone\nscreens, the kids of\nBoipeba are out in force\nas much as the island\u2019s\npopulation of friendly,\ncommunity-owned pups,\nmaking the most of the\nsun and sand. It\u2019s refreshing to visit a place where\npeople still know their\nneighbours and make an\neffort to keep the sense\nof community that much\nof the world has lost. It is\nthat sense of community\nthat binds the people of\nBoipeba to one another,\nand to their home. The\nisland is bestowed with\nworld heritage status from\nUNESCO, an accolade\nthat its people wear\nwith pride and are apt\nto maintain. Motorised\nvehicles are banned from\nthe island, with visitors\ninstead relying on old\nfashioned tractors \u2013 or\ntheir own trusty feet \u2013 to\nshuttle them across the\nisland. With many of the\ncommunity still relying\non traditional agricultural\nand fishing methods for\ntheir livelihoods, it is important that development\non the island is kept in\ncheck, and not allowed\nto interfere with local\ncustoms. Amabo, the\nAssociation of Residents\nand Friends of Boipeba,\nwas founded to protect\nthe life of residents and\nthe local environment, as\nwell as educating people\non the conWWtemporary\nissues at play. It is just\none of the groups that are\nprotecting that coveted\nUNESCO status. With the\nconstant threat of international developers intent\non building resorts on the\nisland, groups like Amabo\nplay an important role\nin the discussion. While\nthe would-be developers\nargue that the island belongs to Brazil and is fair\ngame for acquisition and\ndevelopment to help bolster the nation\u2019s economy,\nresidents and conservation groups take the view\nthat the island\u2019s delicate\necosystems belong to all\nof humanity and cannot\nbe decimated in the name\nof capital and growth.\nBoipeba Island // Chris Richardson\nISSUE 1717\nFELIX\nTRAVEL travel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nWith a little help from\na team of dedicated\npro bono lawyers, the\nresidents and friends of\nBoipeba have \u2013 for now\nat least \u2013 managed to keep\nunwanted, unsustainable\nresort development at\nbay. But with President\nBolsonaro intent on\nopening the nation to\ninternational investment,\nwith little regard to the\ndelicate ecosystems worth\nfighting to maintain, the\nsecurity of Boipeba\u2019s\nUNESCO status \u2013 and\nthe livelihoods of its\nresidents \u2013 is still under\nthreat. In this regard,\nBoipeba Island becomes\na symbol to which we\ncan all relate, and its fight\nfor sustainability a cause\nwe can all get behind.\nWhether it\u2019s a faraway\ntropical island, an even\nfarther polar glacier, or a\nbeloved woodland by our\nown backyard, we know\nthat it is worth standing\nup for voiceless entities,\nagainst capitalist growth.\nThat way our planet may\nretain its balance and\nbeauty \u2013 indeed, remain a\nplace on which we all can\nlive \u2013 for many years to\ncome.\nA tale of two\ntowns:\nNo trip to Boipeba would\nbe complete without\nample exploration of its\ntwo famed villages, Velha\nBoipeba and Morer\u00e9. To\nhelp you better understand\nthe island and community\nwhile keeping in line\nwith sustainable ideals,\nto understand family life\non the island, which will\nprobably include drop-in\nvisits from some of the\nlocal children looking for\na fresh juice made from\nfine fruits you\u2019ve probably\nnever heard of, and some\nof the local hummingbirds\non their morning flight.\nThe family are happy to\nhelp make your stay as\nmuch as they help the\nlocal community, offering\nguidance on places to\nwalk and where to eat.\nPerhaps most importantly,\nFernando is a talented\nchocolatier creating\na range of delicious\nproducts using fresh-ly-picked cacau, as well\nas teaching local children\nabout his craft. Do not\nleave without sampling\nsome of the tasty treats on\noffer, and taking some for\nthe road.\nCasa Bobo: Instagram\n@EcoCasaBobo. Perched\nfrom a terrific vantage\npoint above Morer\u00e9 and\nneighbouring Bainema\nbeach sits the island\u2019s top\nrated eco pousada. The\nreputation that couple\nMyriam and Nilton have\nbuilt up over the years is\nlegendary, with plenty of\nawards and reviews that\nspeak for themselves.\nCasa Bobo is a set of\nthree gorgeous bungalows constructed using\nlocally-sourced labour\nand materials, with beautiful communal spaces\nto enjoy both sunrise\nand sunset. Worthy of its\neco pousada title, Casa\nBobo is involved in many\nsustainability projects:\nproviding space to build\nmuch-needed water\ntanks, donating materials\nto university recycling\nprograms, and organising\nregular beach cleanups.\nThey are also on the front-lines of the ongoing battle\nto protect the island\u2019s\nUNESCO status. And\nthen there\u2019s the wonderful\nselection of food, freshly\nprepared with ingredients\nsourced from the ranch\u2019s\nstunning gardens, laying\nto rest the idea that Brazil\ncan\u2019t deliver gastronomy.\nWith Myriam on breakfast\nduties, and Nilton\u2019s sunset\nbar whipping up tasty acai\nbowls, caipirinhas, and\ngrilled fish, you are in the\nsafest of hands. Oh, and\nyou\u2019ll also find a selection\nof Fernando\u2019s treats available at the mini bar.Above\nall, Casa Bobo is a place\nfilled with love. Love for\nthe island, support for its\nlocal businesses, and an\nunforgettable experience\nfor any visitor lucky\nenough to bag a bungalow\nfor a few days.\nYou can help the\nBoipeba community curb\nunsustainable development on the island by\ntaking a moment to sign\nthe petition at bit.ly/2tm-NAXY.\nFor more information\non visiting Bahia or\nBoipeba, please contact\nthe Editor.\nEcoCasaBobo // Liliane Laborde-Edozien on Instagram\nwe recommend two\nlodgings offering a unique\nBoipeba experience.\nFernando\u2019s: Instagram @\nFFernandoSS11.\nTucked behind the little\ncobbled streets of Velha\nBoipeba is the home of\nFernando and his mother,\nDona Nilda. The family\noffers simple rooms\nwithin their home, use of\nthe kitchen, and a delicious breakfast prepared\nby Nilda to set you up for\na hard day at the beach.

As a trustee, I would help ensure that the\nUnion doesn't deviate from its mission and takes the\nbest interest of its students at heart whilst also balancing\nthe budget. This is not something I will take lightly and\nyou can be sure I will work hard to make sure these are\nmet.This will not be my first time representing students,\nmanaging a budget or overseeing a project.

It's time for\na change. Hi, I'm Ansh.\nI'm a third year physicist\nrunning to sit on Trustee\nBoard because we need\nto ensure that the Union's\nresources are being allocated to enact the decisions we\nmake, so we can truly become a member-led Union.\nThis year we are heading for a \u00a3365,000 deficit, primarily due to hiring expensive agency staff after the\npoor treatment of student bar staff - and cuts may be\nmade that affect us all.

I've worked with\nFaculties, Constituent Unions, the Union, & College\non issues ranging from the running of your Clubs &\nSocieties, to welfare provision through disciplinary\nprocedures, & emergency planning mitigation for student led events, so I know what change is possible &\nhow to go about making change happen.\nI WILL:\n\u2022 PROTECT the identity and history of our Constituent Unions\n\u2022 ENSURE that all areas and all those who work\nfor the Union, as volunteers or otherwise, are\nheld accountable to its members\n\u2022 LOBBY for consultation on all large matters\naffecting the student experience to maintain our\ncore democratic values\n\u2022 COMMUNICATE what both Board, and the\nUnion on a whole are deciding and taking action\non, with its members\nConsultation, representation, and communication\nhave been a hallmark of my terms in a multitude of\nstudent volunteering positions.

I'll keep this\nmanifesto entirely honest, because that's\nwhat you expect from someone whom\nyou're supposed to trust (a Student Trustee). I think\nI'm better than most of the other candidates, although\nat the time of writing I'm not exactly sure who those\nare. I have some experience in the Union which isn't\n100% relevant, but it should be enough. I don't actually\nknow what the role is exactly about (but I'm guessing\nneither do you). I assume I'd represent the students on\nthe Trustee Board (duh). Anyway, that's what training is\nfor, so you should not worry - I'll be ready for the role\nby August! I decided I should run after a discussion with one of the current Student\nTrustees, which made me realise that I might be good for the role. My mum also said\nI should run, or at least she definitely would if I asked her. I hope. I don't want to\npromise you anything because I don't know if I could achieve it, but I do have some\nideas that I think would be good for the Union and for the students, and I generally\nconsider myself to be a person with reasonable views and opinions who can usually\ntell good from bad.

Some of my key goals for ICU include:\n\u2022 Running more events that are accessible to the\nentire student population, including pushing\nfor a variety of musicians to come perform at\nImperial!\n\u2022 Increasing the freedom and flexibility of room\nbookings and union personal resources (finan-cial, advisory and project services)\n\u2022 Implementing easy and relatively hassle-free\nways of collecting your feedback and acting on\nit in a timely fashion\n\u2022 Making the reimbursement and financial e-activ-ities system of individual societies more efficient\nand straightforward\nPersonally, my past experience has amply prepared\nme for this role. I have worked within the Union\nbefore as Biochemistry first year Wellbeing Rep\nand have been trained in effective leadership and\nrepresentation. I have also worked with the Union\nwhile I was organizing two major events for Finance\nSociety, and I personally understand how frustrating the union's financial claims system can be. In\naddition, my experience as Marketing Director in\nthe Social Innovation Academy has refined my communication skills, so I can use effective methods to\nimprove transparency and to better implement your\nfeedback. As your Student Trustee I will work to\nmake our university experience better!\n\n"

Being a Union President means the re-sponsibility, the responsibility that others may regard as\ndrudgery but you consider as the source of happiness.\nBeing a Union President means sacrifice, sacrificing the\ntime which you may have used to amuse yourself rather\nthan help others.Being a Union President means being\nequal, for which you are standing on the behalf of all\nstudents you represent and what you do must represent\nthe interest of majority.This job is going to be hard and\nnot to be easy. It is not a causal game to simply play\nwith. It means responsibility, means the desire to help\nothers, to stand for your group, to stand for the profits\nof all people involved, and it means you have been determined to listen to all the feedback from students that\nyou represent, to present each students' ideas equally,\nand to treat others warmly.I often ask myself , 'Do you\nthink you can take this heavy task?'.

This\nis why I am running for\nUnion President - to\nlead positive change for\nALL students. Through\nmy work on Constituent\nUnions as the RCSU\nPresident and Treasurer,\nCSP Committees, and as a\nDepartmental Representative, I have led on a number of\ninitiatives that have benefited students now, and in the\nfuture. My goals are:\n\u2022 Save Our Services & Back our Bars - Improve\ncommercial services rather than cut them and\nkeep major facilities (Reynolds/h-bar/Union\nBar) open.\n\u2022 Support Constituent Unions - Support and Grow\nthe Constituent Unions (RCSU, ICSM, CGCU,\nRSM & GSU), so that they are celebrated and at\nthe centre of the student experience.\n\u2022 Create Campus Coordination - Provide the\nopportunity for students at all campuses to feel\nengaged with the student community and get\ninvolved in all union activities.\n\u2022 Champion CSP volunteers - Reduce the level of\nadministrative work for volunteers so they can\nfocus on being involved in the Club/Society/\nProject they love.\n\u2022 Develop Direct Democracy - Implement methods\nthat makes Union Council more accessible and\neffective in applying solutions to issues affecting\nstudents.\n\u2022 Fix the NSS Mess - Work to raise issues to\nCollege that are frequently mentioned in the\nNSS survey, and ensure they are fixed. College,\nlike the Union, should be proactive in improving\nthe student experience.\n\u2022 Increase Counselling Support - Improve on\nwaiting times for the Student Counselling\nservice, increasing provisions and support they\ncan provide to students.\nPlease check out my full manifesto at my website:\nhttp://mikeforunionpresident.strikingly.com\nYinlin Wang\nA\nfter I talked\nabout my working purpose\nand feasible\nplan to our now union\npresident Rob and some\ninternational students, I\nget my final manifesto:\n1.

Thank you for considering to vote for me, to improve educational experience and outcomes at Imperial for ALL\nstudents.Imperial's new Teaching and Learning Strategy promises to enhance the educational experience & quality for students.\nThere is significant funding for department-wide curricula and pedagogic transformation. It is imperative that this translates to a\nbetter learning experience and outcomes for all students.\nAssessment & Feedback: The National Student Survey (NSS 2018) and Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES 2018) scored 64%\nand 58% respectively in this area. These are worrying figures and I will work hard with departments to ensure clear assessment criteria and\nquality, timely feedback.\nStudent Engagement in Curriculum Reviews:We are currently undergoing UG & PG Curriculum Review with implementation imminent.\nMoving forwards, it will be critical to have student engagement in this process, particularly from postgrad taught students.\nEnsure Accurate Reporting: The college intends to evaluate and research innovations in education, and to publish outcomes. I will make\nsure reporting is done in a reliable and transparent manner; moreover, to ensure that innovations result in a better student experience.\nPostgraduate Research Experience: Often a neglected part of the Imperial community. I will make sure \"innovations in education\" are also\napplied to the PhD student experience. This includes offering services and experiences to the other Imperial campuses.\nFind out more here: ABforDPE.weebly.com\n\"Teaching should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not as a hard duty.\", Albert Einstein\nDeputyPresident(Clubs&Societies)\nJunhua Li\nH\ni, I'm Jerry Li (aka.

Dubious\npre-race calculations suggested a simple eleventh\nplace finish would guarantee the silver.\nIn the simultaneous\nyet shorter women\u2019s race,\nImperial star athletes Kate\nOlding and Georgia Curry\nwere tied for gold going\ninto the race. With third\nplace in the league well\nout of the running, this\nfinal race was a straight\nshootout for the gold. Both\nathletes went into the race\ncarrying minor injuries\nbut were determined to do\neverything to bring home\nthe fabled gold.\nWith four scoring\nmembers for each team\nit was also important that\nthe women\u2019s squad had\nsufficient depth to allow\nthe B team to outscore\nReading\u2019s A team and\nsecure an unprecedented\ndouble podium for the\nwomen.\nIn the men\u2019s race Niki\nstormed home in third\nwith the A team packing\nstrongly: Oliver Newton\ncame 12th, Joe Pomfret\nfinished 16th, Henry Hart\n17th, and Mihaly Ormay\n22nd.\nIn the women\u2019s race,\nGeorgia Curry was pipped\nto the line by a St Mary\u2019s\nathlete, with the rest of the\ntop five filled by Imperial\u2019s Alex Mundell in third,\nChloe Baker in fourth,\nand Alix Vermeulen in\nfifth. The entire B team\nalso finished in the top 20!\nAll that was left of the\nday was the prize-giving.\nFirst were the individual\nawards for the top-scor-ing six athletes across\ntheir best four races in\nthe league. Fresher Alix\nVermeulen was pleasantly\nsurprised to place fourth,\nand was just three points\nbehind third. Kate Olding\nwas loudly cheered as she\ncollected her silver medal\nafter succumbing to an\nunfortunate injury in the\nfinal race, but that left the\ngold medal which went\nto Georgia Curry who\njust pipped Kate to the\ntitle by 2 points, scoring\na ludicrous 597 out of 600\npoints overall.\nOver in the men\u2019s, Niki\nFaulkner recieved the\nsilver medal, finishing\njust 2 points behind the\nwinning athlete from St\nMary\u2019s with a total of 791\nout of 800 points.\nIn the overall standings,\nthe women\u2019s A teams and\nB teams scored first and\nthird respectively, with\nthe A team receiving an\nunnecessarily large shield.\nThe Men\u2019s took home\nthe bronze medals before\nthe entire squad roared\nwhen it was confirmed\nthey had won the inaugural Mike Baggs Trophy\nfor best mixed squad.\nThe gleaming trophy\nwas embraced by all team\nmembers and paraded\naround the Union later\nthat night at ACC.\nAmazingly, it survived\nthe night and only time\nwill tell if ICXCAC will\nbe able to retain the trophy\nin 2020.\nThe racestarter provides amusement to the runners on the start-line // LUCA\nISSUE 1717\nFELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n48\nwarm-up and a rousing\nteam talk, the squad took\ntheir place on the start line\nalongside other student\nrunners from across\nLondon and beyond.\nBeforetheyknewitthey\nwere off, flying down the\nback straight of the Scrubs\nPosing with the girthy shield and shiny cup // ICXCAC\n\n"

A formal\nresponse from the USS is\nexpected in early April.\nUSS is offering two\npossibilities to overhaul\nprevious planned changes\nthat resulted in strikes and\nindustrial action at more\nthan 60 universities across\nthe country. The \u201cupper\nbookend\u201d approach would\nrequire total contributions\nof 33.7% to maintain the\ncurrent benefits; 23% of\nthis would be paid by employers and the remaining\n10.7% paid by employees.\nUniversities UK, which\nrepresents the country\u2019s\nhigher education institu-tions, has claimed that this\nwould be \u201cunsustainable\u201d\nand an \u201cundeniable threat\nto investment and to jobs\u201d.\nThe \u201clower bookend\u201d\napproach would see\ncontributions set at 29.7%\n(20.4% from employers\nand 9.3% from employ-ees). However, the USS is\nonly willing to adopt this\nlower bookend approach\nif additional contingent\ncontributions can be guaranteed in the event that\n\u201cmarket events caused\na further deterioration\nin the recovery of the\ndeficit\u201d (i.e. contribution\nlevels would increase if\nfunding for the scheme\nsignificantly decreased).\nAs of March 2018, the\npension scheme was operating with a deficit of \u00a33.6\nbillion.\nEmployers are now\nbeing asked for their\nviews on these proposals,\nas well as on the eleven\nprinciples set out by\nthe USS under which it\nwould be \u201cprepared to\nconsider\u201d contingent con-tributions. These include\nthe requirement for an\nobjective \u201ctrigger metric\u201d\nthat will only bring\ncontingent contributions\ninto force in the event of\nan \u201cadverse scenario\u201d (as\nopposed to normal market\nfluctuations); contingent\ncontributions to be set at\nlevels that will \u201csubstantially improve the funding\nposition\u201d; and a guarantee\nthat contingent contributions will be paid in full if\ninvoked. A letter to USS\nchair Sir David Eastwood\nfrom The Pensions Regulator confirmed that any\ndecision to move away\nfrom the proposals that\narose from the 2017 valuation would need to be\nNEWS\nJoanna Wormald\nDeputy Editor\n\u201cfully backed by addition-al, tangible, and realisable\ncontingent support from\nthe employers\u201d.\nIf no agreement is\nreached between USS and\nUUK, contributions will\nincrease in accordance\nwith results from the 2017\nvaluation. This would\nmean a phased increase in\nemployer and employee\ncontributions beginning\nin April this year. By April\n2020, contributions would\ntotal 35.6%, with 24.2%\ncoming from employers\nand employee contributions making up the remaining 11.4%. Imperial\nrecognises that these rises\nwould be \u201cunsustainable\u201d\nfor many staff.\nIf \u2013 as UUK hopes \u2013\nthe USS does adopt the\nlower bookend approach,\nthe arrangements will be\ntime-limited. A report on\nthe long-term sustainability of the USS is due\nin autumn; its findings\nare likely to impact the\nnext valuation (currently\nscheduled for 2021) and\ncould effectively \u201creset\u201d\nany decisions made\nregarding contingent con-tributions.\nCurrent planned changes // Imperial College London\nNEWS\n(cont.)\n\u201cleaky pipe\u201d metaphor\nas a key issue tackled by\n500 Women Scientists.\nThe metaphor illustrates\nthe \u201cleaking\u201d of women\nfrom the scientific talent\npipeline, starting from\nhigh school science\nclasses (49% women) to\nbachelor\u2019s degrees (32%)\nto PhDs (25%) to top\nacademic positions (only\n11%).\nThis is due to the \u201cinstitutional discrimination\u201d\nwithin science, where\nthe structural system for\nadvancing one\u2019s scientific\ncareer is built for only one\nkind of person: a cis white\nmale. These discriminations take shape in the\nform of unequal pay for\nequal work, inadequate\nfamily leave policies, and\nworkplace harassment.\nThese factors build upon\neach other to pressure\nwomen to leave the field\nearlier.\nThrough 500 Women\nScientists (500WS),\nKelly and Co-founder\nJane Zelikova implement\nsolutions to institutional\ndiscrimination, although\nthe full scope of the organisation\u2019s work is much\nbroader and has expanded\nbeyond its original param-eters. Kelly explains, \u201cwe\nquickly evolved from our\nreactionary beginnings\ntowards a broader mission\nto serve society by making\nscience more open, inclu-sive, and accessible.\u201d\n500WS provides resources to its local chap-ters, endearingly named\n\u201cpods\u201d, such as ones\naddressing \u201cget out the\nvote\u201d initiatives, public\npolicy, ending workplace\nharassment, and science\ncommunication. They cat-alyse change by providing\ntraining, mentorships, and\npublic outreach opportunities to members; they\nactively try to promote\nwomen into positions of\npower and leadership, to\nbecome award winners\nor society presidents and\nmore; they aim to make\nscience accessible to\neveryone through events\norganised by local pods to\nbring science to the com-munity, such as family\nnight science camps. It is\nthrough these approaches,\nthrough crowdsourcing\nand gritty determination,\nthat they want to transform\nscientific institutions.\nFelix sat down with\nKelly and Imperial\nDepartment of Physics\nresearch associate Dr.\nJessica Wade, who is also\nknown for her advocacy\nfor women scientists. Jess\nwrites biographies on\nWikipedia of impressive\nwomen scientists whose\nwork have not been\ncelebrated or recognized\nenough. Dr. Shini Somara,\nhost of the Scilence\npodcast, that interviews\nwomen in STEM about\nthe challenges of being\na woman in STEM, also\njoined the discussion.\nFelix: Has your\norganization faced\nany backlash or\nresistance, or come\nacross people who\nstrongly disagree with\nyour mission?\nKelly: Yes. We are\nwomen speaking out and\nany woman who speaks\nloud enough will get\nbacklash. Mostly from\nemails or Twitter. The\nbenefit of our organisation\nis that we do it behind the\n500 Women Scientists\nwall. For a lot of the stuff\nwe do, we sign it as 500\nWomen Scientists so\nthere\u2019s not an individual.\nJess: After I called\nsomeone out last year for\nbeing a horrible sexist,\nbecause he was, I got a\nbunch of emails for about a\nmonth every day, and also\nhandwritten letters sent in\nthese funny envelopes to\nme at Imperial. Quite a\nfew very right-wing websites took against me and\ndirected their hundreds\nof thousands of horrible\npeople towards me as\nwell.\nKelly: We did an AMA\n[Ask Me Anything] on\nReddit. Horrible. The\nmoderators running it,\nunder the science subred-dit, were unprepared\nfor how many nasty\ncomments there would\nbe and they had to bring\nin way more moderators\nthan they ever had to with\nany other science AMA. It\nwas horrific.\nJess: You\u2019ll always\nget haters, that\u2019s fine, I\ndon\u2019t care. If they liked\nme, I\u2019d be worried. That\u2019s\ngenerally had to be my\napproach to it. The backlashes that upset you more\nare the ones where, pro-fessionally, people may\nnot take you as seriously\nbecause you care about\nthis kind of stuff.\nHow does someone\nwho is being\nsexually harassed, or\nsomeone who feels\ndiscriminated against\nbecause they\u2019re a\nwoman, speak up in\nthe workplace?\nKelly: It\u2019s really hard.\nSome institutions are\ngoing to be better about\nit than others. If you\u2019re\nlucky, you\u2019ll have a\nsupervisor that you can\ngo talk to and share your\nexperience with, and who\nwill be there to support\nyou through the process.\nJess: I think that\u2019s the\ntricky thing, that the majority of places, take the\nUK, don\u2019t have any policy\nto protect people who are\nsuffering this.\nWhen I came in, I\nnoticed a lack of men\nin the room. I think\nthere was only 1,\nmaybe 2 [the crowd\nratio was 1 male to 15\nfemales]. How do you\naffect real change, if\nyou are having these\nconversations but\nonly women are there,\nand women already\nknow the problems?\nKelly: I don\u2019t think\nall women already know\nthe problems. I think\nsome women know, the\nmajority probably \u201cfeel\nlike something\u2019s off\u201d. I\nthink that\u2019s true for a lot\nof women, especially\nyounger women. There\nare women who are just\ncompletely unaware\nand they\u2019re probably in\na very nice position of\nprivilege, so they haven\u2019t\nbeen confronted with a\nchallenge, so why would\nthey know?\nJess: I think there are\nreally great men, especially at Imperial, who\nare really championing\nthe cause. I think Stephen\nCurry\u2019s position [Assis-tant Provost (Equality,\nDiversity, Inclusion)] is\nso, so, so important. I\ndo think men have to be\ninvolved, and it\u2019s very\nsimilar to the kind of\nconversation about the\nlack of minority ethnic\nacademics, right? It can\u2019t\nonly be on the few black\nprofessors already there to\nspeak up; it can\u2019t be up to\nthem to fix that for all of\nthe other black students\ncoming through, you have\nto have other people doing\nit.\n20 years ago, there\nwere 5% of the\nprofessors at Imperial\nwere women. That\nrose to 15% in 2009.\nSince 2009, it\u2019s only\nincreased by 1%, so\nit\u2019s going a step in the\nright direction but\nthe pace of change is\nextremely, extremely\nslow.\nJess: I think it\u2019s\ndepartmental. You have\ndepartments like Medicine with 50-50 men and\nwomen and that\u2019s because\npeople take it really seri-ously. The Athena Swan\nAward is great because it\nwas pretty terrible before\nfor women academics.\nIt makes people collect\ndata and to try and initiate\npractices to better support\nunderrepresented communities and that\u2019s always\na good thing. You can\u2019t\nget funding in Medical\nsciences unless you\nhave at least the Athena\nSwan Silver, that\u2019s had a\nreally, really big impact\nand that\u2019s why you have\n50-50.\nDo you know the\ngender ratio of\nstudents at Imperial?\nJess: Physics is about\n20-25%. Really interest-ingly, Physics A-Level is\n20-25% girls and Physics\nat university is 20-25%\ngirls, so the girls who\ndo Physics A Level are\nthe only ones doing it at\nuniversity. No-one does\nit as just a \u201chey cool, the\nuniverse is fun, I\u2019m going\nto do it as a side project\u201d,\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nmatter what\nyou do. You\nwill always get\nhaters\u201d\nand that\u2019s really sad.\nKelly: That just highlights that each different\ndiscipline has a different\nchallenge. In my field,\nbiology and ecology,\nthrough undergrad and\ngrad it's 50-50, but there\u2019s\njust a huge drop-off for\npostdocs and then for pro-fessors, whereas Physics\nalready starts with a drop-off.\nJess: I think we really\nneed to get better at how\nwe talk about it. Women\nleaving isn\u2019t because they\nare leaving and failing,\nit\u2019s because every single\njob in the whole world\nwants to employ academic\nwomen scientists. When\nyou finish your degree\nhere you can choose to\ndo a PhD if you want,\nbut consultancy will want\nyou, investment banks\nwill want you, policy will\nwant you, people will beg\nfor you to teach. There are\nso many different career\noptions that you can do\nand you can go into one\nData shows incremental change in the percentage of\nwomen at Imperial in the last 15 years // Imperial College\nlondon\nwhere you\u2019re not going to\nbe subjected to sexism or\nisolation all the time.\n\n"

As defensive stocks, CG stocks\nare more likely to outperform in bear markets than\nin bull markets. In recent\nyears, CG stocks have\nwidely underperformed\nin the broader market for\nseveral reasons. Investors\nhave become enamored\nwith tech stocks, such\nas the FAANG group,\nthat have consistently\noutperformed. Rising\ninterest rates have also\nmade bonds more appealing to conservative,\nincome-seeking investors,\nleading them to take some\nmoney out of dividend-paying consumer staples.\nFinally, higher input costs\nhave threatened some CG\nstocks. Most of the CG\nETFs* have underper-formed the S&P 500 over\nthe past five years.\nBut the past is no guide\nto the future. Over the\ncoming decade, upheavals\nin global market will\nlikely to produce as many\nlosers as winners. Asia\nwill overtake the West\nas the main consumer\nmarket, and it will\ndemand new levels of\nvalue and innovation\nfrom companies. Rising\nInternet penetration\ncould upend traditional\nsales models.

It is worth thinking\nabout how company can\nunlock the value-creation\npotential and individuals\nThe rise of digital\nconsumers\nIn the United Kingdom,\nover 80 percent of UK\ninternet users online shop.\nIn China, the online retail\nmarket has soared past\n$1.1trillionin2018.While\ntechnology has played a\nkey role in the consumer\ngoods industry\u2019s growth,\nit will be truly disruptive\nin the coming decade.\nBut while retailers are\nunder increasing pressure,\nthe picture is not bleak\nfor all. Grocery retailers\nare experiencing robust\ngrowth in an inflationary\nenvironment, while the\nnimbler, pure-online\nplayers continue to grow\nmarket share. In figuring\nout how to win in this new\ndigital world, companies\nface some major strategic\nquestions - including\nhow to build a successful\nbusiness through online\nretail channels, how\nto build brands and\ncategories in a socially\nnetworked world, and how\nto understand consumers\nmore deeply and connect\nwith them more often.\nMoreover, digital\nmarketing is no longer a\none-way communication\nto consumers. Social\nmedia provides an\nimportant channel for\ncompanies to \u201clisten\u201d to\nconsumers without biases.\nFor example, Unilever\nused co-creation with\nits online community\nto develop Axe Twist, a\nfragrance that changes\nthroughout the day.\nThe shift of value\nThe global financial\ncrisis has driven\nconsumers to value\nofferings, and it is a trend\nthat is likely to stick. The\nshift to value has major\nimplications for the CG\nindustry\u2019s profit formula.\nNotleast,itcoulderodethe\npricing power of brands.\nPrivate-label players are\nriding the value trend,\naccounting for more than\na key concern for retailers.\nHowever, consumers,\nmillennials in particular,\nincreasingly favour\nsmaller, niche brands\nwith environmentally\nsustainable products.\nE-commerce has also\nopened up new selling and\nadvertising channels for\nupstart brands, which have\nchallenged traditional\nleaders such as P&G\u2019s\nGillette. Such companies\nare also threatened by\nrising private-label sales\nfrom retail giants such as\nAmazon.\n[* Investment funds\nthat bundle a set of stocks\nand trades as a stock,\nthat investors looking for\nexposure across the sector\ncan choose from.]\ncan seek for investment\nopportunities in these\nfollowing trends that are\nhighly likely to shape the\nfuture of the CG sector.\nLet\u2019s now consider each\ntrend in turn.\nA billion new\nc o n s u m e r s\nin emerging\nmarkets\nIn the coming years,\nthe growth of emerging\nmarkets will continue\nto outstrip that of the\ndeveloped world by a wide\nmargin. The emerging\ncountries in Asia\u2014most\nnotably China, India,\nand Indonesia, had a\nsignificant share of global\ngrowth (18%) in the\nlast decade. The global\nmiddle class will expand\ndramatically: by 2020, it\nis expected that more than\na billion new consumers\nspending between $10\nand $100 per day.\nCompanies that\nunderstand and meet these\nnew consumers\u2019 needs\nwill earn tremendous\ncompetitive advantage.\nSuccess factors include\nthe selection of categories,\nmarkets and segmenting\nthe billion new consumers\nand innovating to meet\ntheir needs. Consider\nthe example of Wrigley\nchewing gum in China:\nthe company has captured\n40 percent of a fast-growing category worth\n$2 billion. Its tactics\ninclude regular launches\nof products tailored to\nChinese consumers,\nincluding gum flavored\nwith herbal essences\nand grapefruit; intensive\nconsumer education\nemphasizing the health\nbenefits of chewing gum;\nand building a presence\nin the millions of small\noutlets where Chinese\nconsumers typically shop.\n\u201cGrocery\nretailers are\nexperiencing\nrobust\ngrowth in an\ninflationary\nenvironment\u201d\nSPDR is a samplle consumer goods equity ETF// Google\nAn insight into consumer goods equities...\ne-commerce is on the rise//Economist\n40 percent of supermarket\nsales in the United\nKingdom.

This would have a\ndirect effect on Western\ndeveloped technologies.\nDisasters like this dam\ncollapse also prompt\nquestions about entirely\nnew solutions.

At the\nForum this year there\u2019s a\npanel on Future Energy,\ndiscussing how we could\nsee a global shift into\nrenewable energies and\ncarbon neutral production\nstrategies. With climate\nchange apporaching\ndangerous levels, this\nis an area of paramount\nimportance. Your voices\nmatter: in a few years\nyou may be in a position\nto develop globally\nsignificant technologies-come and hear what\nproblems the industry is\ncurrently facing.\nA question for you:\nAre you into coding?\nWe have a workshop\ndesigned to explore the\nskills needed in electronic\ntrading - specifically the\nbig data reliant machine\nlearning strategies that\nare currently being tested\nin agricultural trading!\nEmerging Markets will be\nthe next expansion point\nfor automated markets -this workshop is a brilliant\nchance to engage with\nprofessionals from the\nindustry, to find out what\nskills they prioritize and\nhow you could use them.\nThese markets are more\nopen for technological\nsolutions as well: banking\napps and blockchain\ncurrency has been tested\nin Sub-Saharan rural\nareas, regions where\nhistorically individuals\nhave had no access to\nfinancial services. This\nhas had a huge effect on\ngender inequality in the\narea - women are able to\nmanage their own finances\nwith much greater ease.\nI would argue that the\nopportunity to develop\nmore basic forms of\ntechnological systems that\nmay well be implemented\nin our own markets is\ncrucial to working out\nwhat effect they could\nhave on our economies.\nThe Forum also has a\npanel dedicated to China\nand its development of\nArtificial Intelligence,\na discussion of its risks\nand potential in economic\ndevelopment. AI has\nbeen a controversial topic\nrecently, the harvesting of\nbig data now undergoing\nclose scrutiny. What are\nyour views?

The\nonly driving environmental factor was predation\nby another simple, sin-gle-celled organism.\nThe research resulted\nfrom a relatively new\napproach to investigating\nthe transition from unicellular to multicellular life.\nAs opposed to retrospective approaches, which\nrely on incomplete fossil\nrecords and comparing\nmore recent multicellular\nto distantly-related extant\nunicellular organisms, this\n\u201cexperimental evolution\u201d\nis more prospective in\nstyle.\nTwo of the five experimental populations\nevolved into multicellular\nlife \u2013 and both showed a\nhigh degree of variance in\ntheir traits and life cycles,\nwithin each population\nand between the two.\nAs evolution works on\nthe basis of beneficial\nmutations becoming nor-malised over a population\nover multiple life cycles,\nthis is exactly what one\nwould expect; however,\nwitnessing it develop in\nreal-time is an exhilarating development.\nThe reason the\nmutation into larger,\nmulticellular organisms\nwas beneficial is that, like\nmany predators, the filter\npredator used (Brachionus\ncalyciflorus) can only\nprey on a narrow range\nof sizes, referred to as the\n\u201cpredation threshold\u201d;\nlarger organisms, in this\ncase the evolved multicellular algae, are largely\nimmune.\nKey to note is that the\nalgae (Chlamydomonas\nreinhardtii) displays\na tendency to form\npalmelloids under certain\nconditions, which are\nglobs of divided cells\nresulting either from\ndaughter cells failing to\nbreak free of the cell wall\nupon division, or the cells\nproducing a gelatinous or\nmucilaginous substance\nwhich then cements them\ntogether. The unicellular\nalgae therefore already\nhad access to \u201ca toolkit for\nproducing multicellular\nstructures\u201d, although an\n\u201coptional\u201d one as opposed\nto the evolved form\u2019s\nobligate multicellular\nstructure.\nThat this response\noccurred purely in\nresponse to predation,\nwith no other selective\npressures, shows that\npredation likely played\nsome part in the initial\nevolutionary leaps to multicellular life - leaps that\neventually culminated in\ncomplex organisms like\nhumans.\nIt also produced some\nstunning timelapses,\nviewable on the original\narticle in Nature.\nInfectious diseases could be diagnosed with\nsmartphones in sub-Saharan Africa\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Editor\nA\nnew Imperialled review has\noutlined how\nhealth workers\ncould use existing phones\nto predict and curb the\nspread of infectious\ndiseases.\nThe review was published in Nature, and\ninvolved researchers\nfrom Imperial, the Karolinska Institute, UCL,\nThe University of KwaZulu-Natal, the Africa\nHealth Research Institute,\nand the London School\nof Hygiene and Tropical\nMedicine. It outlines\nhow healthcare workers\nin low-income countries,\nlike those in sub-Saharan\nAfrica, could use existing\nsmartphones to diagnose,\ntrack and control infectious diseases.\nIt also says that\nsmartphones could also\nhelp enable people to\ntest themselves and get\nresults and support in\ntheir own homes. This\nwould make it easier for\npeople to look after their\nown health - particularly\nin rural regions, where\nclinics can be very distant.\nFor example, patients\nworried about a potential\nHIV infection might be\nmore inclined to get tested\nif they could do it at home\nand avoid the stigma of\nattending a clinic.\nMany smartphones\nhave sensors built in that\ncould aid diagnosis, such\nas a heart rate monitor and\nan oximeter, as well as a\ncamera and microphone\nthat can be used to analyse\nimages and sounds like a\nperson\u2019s breathing.\nIn addition, simple\ntesting technologies are\nbeing developed that can\nbe linked into a phone, via\na USB stick or wirelessly.\nIn theory, a person could\ntest themselves using an\neasy to collect sample,\nsuch as a pinprick of\nblood, and the results\nwould be scanned onto\nmobile apps. Approaches\noutlined in the review\ninclude apps that use\nthe phone\u2019s camera to\ninterpret test results, send\nfindings to local clinics\nor healthcare workers,\nand host virtual follow-up\nappointments with healthcare workers.\nCombined, the test\nresults would then build\na picture of symptoms\nacross a region to help\npredict and fight current\nand future outbreaks.\nThe authors add that\nthese ideas are not without\nchallenges. Although\nrapid technological\nadvances have improved\naccess to testing, more\nthan 35 percent of the\nworld does not have\naccess to mobile phones.\nIt is also easier to accurately collect and analyse\nsamples in a healthcare\nsetting, where there are\ntrained staff and the environment is designed to be\nsterile, than in a person\u2019s\nhome.\nFurthermore, safeguarding measures must\nbe put in place to protect\nthe privacy and confidentiality of patient data,\nthe authors say. These\nmeasures must also be\nfully explained to users to\nbuild trust in and encourage adoption of these new\nhealthcare services.\nStill, the report\u2019s\nauthors remain optimis-tic. As of 2016, global\nsmartphone adoption has\nreached 51 percent and is\npredicted to keep growing\n- particularly in resource\nlimited settings such\nas sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe potential to develop\nthese powerful new tools\nin diagnosis and disease\noutbreak predictions is\nonly growing.\n\u201cthe\ndevelopment\nof single-cell\nalgae into\nmulticellular\norganisms\ntook only 50\nweeks, or 750\ngenerations.\u201d\n\u201cThe reason\nthe mutation\ninto larger,\nmulticellular\norganisms was\nbeneficial is\nthat the filter\npredator used\ncan only prey\non a narrow\nrange of sizes\u201d\nSCIENCE\nHenry Alman\nScience Editor\n\n"

If you haven\u2019t,\nyou must\u2019ve at least seen\nit with the long queues\nof hungry students there\nevery week, or got a whiff\nof their homemade custom\nmasala (mix of spices), or\nprobably had a chat with\nthe lovely team operating\nthe family-run business.\nMumbai Mix serves a\nminimalist menu, making\nchoosing what to have\nfor lunch so much less\nstressful for the indecisive\nones among us (seriously,\nwhat\u2019s up with those\n20-page menus every-where?). With their most\npopular option being the\nDosa Wrap with Biryani\nRice, you could also opt\nfor something lighter like\nthe Dosa Wrap by itself,\nor a crunchy, deliciously\ngolden vegetable samosa,\nand some delicious\nhomemade masala chai\non the side \u2013 a delectable\n\u201cIt really felt\nlike I had\njust been\nhanded a slice\nof Mumbai,\nwith the\nauthenticity\nof the flavours\noozing from\nthe masalas\nsecond-tonone\u201d \u201cfreshlymade\nchutneys -including a\nfiery roasted\nred pepper,\na delicate\ntamarind and\ndate, and my\nfavourite,\na soothing\ncoconutcoriander\u201d\nsubstitute to your afternoon skinny latte. Alternatively, you could also\ngo for a vegetable biryani\nand potato curry if you\u2019ve\ngot a bigger appetite.\nI\u2019ve heard everyone\nraving about their food\nconstantly, and after\nreading the fantastic piece\non the authenticity of the\nfood and how it started\noff in Felix last week, I\nknew I had to give it a try\nmyself and see what the\nhype was all about and\nboy, the whole experience\nwas amazing!\nQueuing for their food\nwas an experience within\nitself \u2013 the fragrant aromas\nwafting from the food got\nme excited and made for\na mouth-watering wait.\nAt the front, the service\nwas immaculate \u2013 the\nteam (Mohini, Deshna,\nand Dimple) greets you\nwith smiles and are pleasantly cheerful and chatty,\noffering that perfect break\nfrom revision after a long\nmorning at the library.\nThe Dosa Wrap\nwas in its own league,\nwith a combination of\nflavours and aromas I\u2019d\nonly ever tasted in local\nmarkets whilst travelling\nabroad. It really felt like\nI had just been handed\na slice of Mumbai, with\nthe authenticity of the\nflavours oozing from the\nmasalas second-to-none.\nThe pancake, made solely\nusing lentils and rice,\nwas delicately thin yet\nincredibly satisfying, and\nthe ladies at Mumbai Mix\neven spice each individual\nwrap to your liking - even\nserving extra hot pancakes\nthat would satisfy that\nheat craving for all those\n\u201cNando\u2019s Extra Hot isn\u2019t\neven that spicy\u201d people.\nA potato and onion\nfilling complemented the\npancakes beautifully \u2013 the\npotatoes were slow-roast-ed to perfection, and\nspiced enough so that\nthey were indulgent but\nnot overpowered. The\ndish was then topped with\nfreshly-made chutneys \u2013\nincluding a fiery roasted\nred pepper, a delicate\ntamarind and date, and\nmy personal favourite, a\nsoothing coconut-corian-der.\nTo complement the\nwrap, I opted for a\nvegetable samosa - how\ncould I not with the\nbeautiful crispy golden\ncoating (literally felt like\nit was calling my name!).\nThe contrast between the\ncrunchiness of the pastry\ncombined with the hot and\nhearty filling made for the\nperfect side dish for my\nwrap, and left my home-cooked food craving\n100% satisfied (and was\nsuch a yummy change to\nyour usual library caf\u00e9\nfood or a cold BLT).\nWhether you\u2019re\nwatching your wallet\nor your waist, Mumbai\nMix is the perfect venue\nfor both. At only \u00a36 for\na Dosa Wrap and \u00a31.50\nfor a Samosa, this stall is\ndefinitely a hit if you\u2019re\nbargain hunting at the\nFarmers Market, or if\nyou\u2019re on a student budget\n(RIP student finance).

Being\ngluten-free, you also\ndon\u2019t get that belly bloat\nwith Mumbai Mix that\nyou do with other food,\nand you\u2019re satisfyingly\nfull without feeling like\nyou\u2019ve just consumed a\ntruck of food. With a full\nvegetarian menu, you\u2019ll\nalso be doing your bit\nfor the environment (a\ngreat way to add No-Meat\nTuesdays to your week\nwithout even missing the\nmeat!)\nWith all that said, what\nare you waiting for?

Over the\nlast two weeks in tit-for-tat the militaries of both\ncountries have conducted\ncross border operations,\nthus escalating the tensions between the nuclear\narmed states.\nRussia, North Korea, nor\nIran. The India-Pakistan\nconflict over the disputed\nregion of Jammu and\nKashmir has been at the\nepicentre of at least three\nnuclear flashpoints in this\nmillennium. This colonial\nera conflict has already\nresulted in over four wars,\nwith the latest one being\nin 1999 when both countries had declared nuclear\narsenals.\nwho before had never\nbeen to India, had omitted\nthe three princely states\nwhose rulers had refused\nto merge with either\nIndia or Pakistan. Whilst\nHyderabad and Junagadh\nwas successfully annexed\ninto the Indian union,\nthe question of Jammu\nand Kashmir remained.\nKashmir had a Hindu\nMaharaja ruling over a\nkingdom which had a 70%\nMuslim population, and\ncontrolling vital rivers for\nboth India and Pakistan.\nVoltaire famously said\nof Prussia that unlike\nmost states which have an\narmy, in Prussia the army\nhad a state. This description perfectly describes\nPakistan, with most of the\nperiod since independence having been ruled\nby the military. In order to\nsustain its disproportional\nbudget allocation, for\npure survival the military\nestablishment must\nmaintain the constant\nfear of a perennial enemy.\nSince the Soviet invasion\nofAfghanistan, it has been\nthe policy of Pakistan\u2019s\nmilitary establishment\nto use Islamic militants\n\u201cto bleed India through\na thousand cuts\u201d. When\nPakistan-funded militants bombed the Indian\nparliament in 2002 and\nlaid siege to Mumbai and\nkilled 174 people in 2008,\ntensions between both\ncountries were at boiling\npoints. Yet previous\nIndian governments had\nthe good wisdom of practising restraint. But this is\nan election year in India.\nThe Modi-led Indian\ngovernment launched\n\u201cpre-emptive\u201d airstrikes\nwithin Pakistani territory,\nthe first ever military\nresponse outside the\ndisputed Kashmir region\nsince 1971. In order to\nsave face, Imran Khan,\nPakistan\u2019s cricketer turned\nPrime Minister, ordered\nretaliatory air strikes last\nweek. Whist the details\nremain murky through\nthe fog of war, an Indian\nMiG 21 was shot down in\nPakistani airspace whilst\nshooting down a Pakistani\nF-16. Thankfully all the\nairmen safely ejected.\nas per the Geneva Protocols. So the world can rest\neasy once again, till the\nnext time these two quarrelsome neighbours think\nto raise the collective\nblood pressures of people\naround the world.\nIn order to avoid a\nrepeat performance, there\nmust be concrete measures\nundertaken by both coun-tries. Firstly, Kashmiris\nmust recognise that an\nindependent Jammu and\nKashmir will never materialise because the geopolitical reality will never\ntolerate an independent\nstate sandwiched between\nthree nuclear powers (the\nthird one being China).\nTherefore, the many\nrightful grievances of\nyoung Kashmiris must\nbe settled within the Pakistani and Indian states.\nSecondly, the Pakistani\nstate must abandon its\nfoolhardy use of proxies\nto change the borders of\nthe Line of Control. For\ntoo long, international\nterrorists like Hafiz Saeed\nand Massod Azhar have\nwalked the streets of\nPakistan with impunity.\nFor who can forget that\nOsama Bin Laden was\nliving a few kilometres off\ntheir GCHQ. If Pakistan\ndoesn\u2019t want to be a pariah\nstate, it must accept the\ndiplomatic norm of this\ncentury, Pakistan must\nstop funding terrorist\norganisations and help\nto bring them to justice.\nNot only India, but Iran\nand Afghanistan have\nsuffered in the hands of\nPakistani terrorist. But\nabove all, the good people\nof Pakistan have lost over\n70,000 fellow citizens to\nthe scourge of terrorism\nsince 2001.

In 1947, as 200\nyears of British colonialism in India was winding\ndown, the borders of\nthe region had to be\nredrawn for the creation\nof Pakistan. Partition\nwas a messy affair with\nover 1.5 million deaths in\nPunjab and Bengal over\nthe contentious border,\nlet alone the question of\nthe princely states.

As a\npeace measure, Pakistan\nreleased Wing-Commander Abhinandan back\nto Indian hands last Friday\nnot heed the sabre-rattling\nof the Indian far right and\nrecognise there can be\nno winners by provoking\nPakistan with military\nattacks,especiallybecause\nPakistan has not declared\na no-first use policy with\nrespect to its growing\nnuclear arsenal. Above\nall, India must recognise\nthe legitimate grievances\nof the Kashmir people. To\nstart with, India can repeal\nthe Armed Forces Special\nPowers Act, which has\neffectively militarised\nthe state for too long, and\nbegin meaningful talks\nwith Pakistan and separatists to peacefully resolve\nthe conflict.\nA hundred years\nago, the first world war\nconsumed the lives of\n21 million people and\nchanged the course of\nhistory.
