We shout when we\u2019re having\nfun, like on roller coasters or anything\nelse that pumps adrenaline through our\nveins. We shout when we want other people to shout with us, and we shout when\nwe\u2019re scared. Sometimes, we\u2019re told\nwe\u2019re shouting when we don\u2019t think we\nare, and sometimes we don\u2019t shout even\nwhen we ought to.\nI didn\u2019t think a single image could do\njustice to this theme, so in this issue I\ndedicate two photos to the complex action that is able to represent such a wide\nrange of emotions.\nNatalia\u2019s photo is the classic \u2018shout\u2019,\nand it\u2019s what we expect from someone at\na protest, who\u2019s unhappy about the state\nof things. It\u2019s important to point out that\nthis picture has more nuance than irst\nmeets the eye. The subject is shouting,\nobviously, but there is a faint glimmer in\nher eyes, a slight grin on her face. Somewhere behind that shout, there is happiness \u2013 the satisfaction that comes from\nopposing what we believe to be wrong\nand facing injustice. We love to see protagonists rise up against all odds and\nfight an antagonist, and I think we all\nought to do more of that ourselves.\nCharlotte\u2019s photo, on the other hand,\npresents us with a completely different\nkind of shout, one that cannot be heard\nby anyone except for the person shout-ing. Actually, we don\u2019t know whether\nthey are shouting at all, but wouldn\u2019t it\nfeel great to be suspended for a moment\nin time (and space) and shout it all out? It\ncould be our sorrow, our happiness, our\ngrief \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter what needs\na shout. We can speculate that this is\nwhat\u2019s happening in Charlotte\u2019s picture.\nIt is these contrasts in interpretation\nthat I want to make this section about. I\nbelieve all artistic media walk the boundary between the obvious and the obscure,\nand I implore artists to find that limit and\nshow it to others, whether that is in writ-ing, on film, as a painting, or in a photo.\nShout\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nIf you\u2019ve been\nsilent too long,\nshouting is\nmedicine for the\nsoul.\nScan the QR code to\nsubmit for the next\ntheme \u2018A Sensory\nExperience\u2018:\nResistance.

The fibrous sheet\nmaterial has proven to be robust and\nversatile, already commonly being used\nin such applications as makeshift um-brellas, decorative wallpaper, protective\npackaging, and as an escape from exceptionally mundane lecturers (the Puzzles\nsection has proved particularly useful for\nthis).\nScientists from the Department of\nEnvironmental Studies tested the multi-functional material as a sustainable alternative to using blank white sheets of\nA4 paper \u2013 reportedly to reduce wastage\nand promote a circular economy. The research team\u2019s experiment involved building bridges out of the papers and testing\ntheir strength using water bottles, arguably lacking in robust scientific method.\nUnfortunately, the potential for recycling became moot when the researchers\nfound the use of tape and Blu-tack was\nnecessary to preserve the structural integrity of the bridges.\nEditors at Felix have contested the morality and ethics of the research group\u2019s\nmethods given that the experiments involved destroying hours of their work,\nespecially since these hours came from\nmissed lectures and a lack of social en-gagements. Some commenters, who\nwished to remain anonymous, threatened to \u2018destroy their public image in the\nnext issue\u2019, and emphasised that \u2018no one\nwill be forgiven\u2019 for this. Another editor\npointed out that \u2018they also used ineffective designs where a simple suspension bridge or half-assed truss structure\nwould have sufficed\u2019.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time an innovative\napplication of the paper has caused Felix\neditors pain; Dalum Crysdale spoke out\nabout their past experience of this, telling Catnip, \u2018my mum has used it to stop\nour shoe rack from getting dirty \u2013 a copy\nof my first-ever article in the paper too\u2019.\nIt remains to be seen whether any\nfurther innovative applications will be\nfound for the paper. For now, Felix requests that researchers refrain from\nco-opting large quantities of the limited\nresource for purposes other than keeping\nup to date with Imperial news.\nCATNIP\nNewspapers not just used for\nreading at STEM university\nLIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES\nARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO\nThis week your train of\nthought is interrupted by\nstrikes\nThis week Israel rereleases\nits Lord of the Rings dub\nwhich changes to Arabic\nwhen the orcs are speaking\nThis week your hands are\ntoo weak to carry all the\nfood you bought\nThis week, bad news for\nanyone with Rw\u00e4nderlust\nThis week you finally\nunderstand that there\nare two types of women\n(your second girlfriend\njust dumped you)\nThis week marks the end\nof \u2018easy mode\u2019\nThis week will bring\nwealth, fortune and gout\nThis week the vibe shift\ncauses largely superficial\ninjuries\nThis week the homies\nhumble you after\nmisapprehending as\nLynchian that which was\nBorgesian\nThis week a\nconstitutional crisis\nheralds an oncoming\ncharismatic crisis\nThis week you Shazam\nthe drone footage of the\nartillery strikes on the\nRussian trench\nThis week you ruffle the\nhair of the little lad with\nthe gammy leg\nRecyclingCorrespondant\nNEGAFELIX\n\n"

Responsible climbing,\nmeticulous route-planning and a keen sense of safety\nwere emphasised throughout the expedition.\nIn their free time, the team engaged in activities\nranging from card games to cooking elaborate meals.\nThe camaraderie extended beyond climbing, with stories shared, laughter echoing in their camp, and friendships forming amidst the breathtaking landscapes.\nElliot highlighted the importance of packing light on\nclimbing routes, carrying essentials like water, chocolate and granola bars, along with safety equipment like\nropes and harnesses.\nReflecting on the journey, Elliot expressed a profound\ndesire to return.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Editorial | 3\nISSUE #1834\nWhere is the sense?\nEDITORIAL\nE\narlier this week, in a dramatic move, Rishi\nSunak appointed David Cameron, the former\nPrime Minister, to the post of Foreign Secretary.\nThe media was abuzz with commentary on what this\nwould mean for Sunak\u2019s premiership, the nation and\nits standing on the world stage.\nMuch of the initial discussion focused on\nthe immediate implications of his return, and\nthe brashness of Sunak\u2019s gambit. But soon, the\nconversation turned to Cameron\u2019s record both in\noffice and afterward: his tawdry lobbying activities\nduring the pandemic, Brexit, the failure of his\nflagship austerity policy, and, perhaps most relevant\nfor this week\u2019s paper, his relationship with China.\nUnder the Cameron-Osborne partnership, from\n2010 to 2016, the UK enjoyed a \u2018Golden Era\u2019 of\nrelations with the Asian giant. \u201cNo economy in the\nworld is as open to Chinese investment as the UK,\u201d\nsaid Osborne, on a trip to China in 2015.\nA huge part of this relationship was a collaboration\nbetween British and Chinese scientists. And\nas the capital\u2019s foremost scientific institution,\nImperial College London benefited greatly. Chinese\nbusinesses lavished money upon the College, and\nChinese students, already a significant minority on\ncampus, flocked in their droves to Imperial.\nIn fact, even after Cameron\u2019s term ended in 2016,\nChinese students continue to come to Imperial.\nBetween 2010/11 and 2022/23, there was a 270%\nincrease in the College\u2019s Chinese student population,\ncompared with only a 62% increase in the size of the\noverall student body.\nUnfortunately for Imperial, Sino-British relations\nsoured in the years following Cameron\u2019s time in\noffice. China\u2019s brutal crackdown on the 2019/20\nHong Kong democracy protest prompted shock\namong the UK\u2019s political elite, and Huawei was\nbanned from developing the nation\u2019s 5G network,\nafter the Chinese company\u2019s involvement was\ndeemed a security risk.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, the so-called \u2018golden era\u2019 is over,\u201d\nsaid Rishi Sunak, in his first major foreign policy\nspeech 12 months ago.\nImperial now appears a rabbit in the headlights,\ncaught between the Western world\u2019s desire to shift\naway from China, and its own reliance on Chinese\ncash.\nThe College is aware of the situation it finds\nitself in. In his inaugural President\u2019s Address last\nyear, Imperial\u2019s Hugh Brady recognised \u201cthe recent\ntectonic shift in our world\u201d, and raised the \u201cquite\nlegitimate question\u201d of \u201cwhether Imperial can\ncontinue to compete successfully in the top tier\nglobally given [the] confluence of threats.\u201d\n\u201cWho and how should we partner? [And] of\ncourse, how can we fund it?\u201d\nThe front-page story this week, however, is\ntestament to Imperial\u2019s naivety. The College has\nbeen found to be funding a scholarship, administered\nby a branch of China\u2019s education ministry, which\nstipulates that students \u2018thoroughly implement Xi\nJingping Thought\u2019.\nChinese Scholarship Council (CSC) rules reveal\nthat \u2018a rigorous review of the applicant\u2019s political\nideology\u2019 must be performed.\nImperial seems to have been oblivious to these\nrules. It meekly accepted that the CSC would have\nthe final say on which candidates were admitted,\neven after universities in other countries cancelled\ntheir own arrangements, citing \u2018industrial espionage\u2019\nconcerns.\nThe result is that the College is spending up to\n\u00a365,000 per head for conformist ideologues who\nreap the benefits of an Imperial education, and then\nupon the conclusion of their studies, are obliged to\nleave the country.\nWhat do Imperial and the UK get out of this\narrangement? Not much, it would seem.\nLet us be clear, this editorial is not a polemic\nagainst the students who benefit from these\nscholarships themselves. Rather, it questions the\nlogic of Imperial\u2019s funding decisions.\nGranted, the total cost of the scholarships is likely\na drop in the ocean to the College.\nBut when viewed on a per student basis, it is a\nhuge sum. Students are struggling as it is \u2013 last year,\nan Imperial PhD student featured in The Guardian\nsaid he was effectively forced to sign up for casual\nwork, such was his financial situation.\nSurely the money the College spends on the CSC\nscholarships would be better spent elsewhere?\n\n"

Brown.\nLaunched in 2020 by Prince William, the prize aims to\nrecognise outstanding and innovative contributions in\nthe environmental technologies sector and put the winning start-ups on the map for others in their respective\nindustries.\nLast year\u2019s winner for the category \u2018Build a WasteFree World\u2019 was Notpla, a start-up founded by graduates\nfrom Imperial College that has developed a biodegradable packaging plastic derived from seaweed. Since being\nawarded the prize, Notpla has achieved a B-Corp certifi-cation, and been named by the Dutch government as the\n\u2018first and only\u2019 plastic-free single-use plastic alternative.\nThere are four other prizes to be won besides the\nwaste-free category \u2013 these are \u2018Protect and Restore Nature\u2019, \u2018Clean Our Air\u2019, \u2018Revive Our Oceans\u2019, and \u2018Fix Our\nClimate\u2019. To advance and support their business devel-opment, each winning start-up receives a \u00a31 million-grant, and all finalists (three per category) are admitted\nto The Earthshot Fellowship Programme for a year.\nWinners for 2023\nAcci\u00f3n Andina, the winner for \u2018Protect and Restore Nature\u2019, have harnessed the Incan \u2018Ayni and Minka\u2019 principles for forest restoration in the Andes mountain range.\nThe start-up\u2019s name translates to \u2018Andean Action\u2019, which\nis fitting given the scale and ambitions of the team.\nTheir hope is that community engagement for effective\nrestoration efforts will solidify the Andes forests as a\nnature-based climate change solution. The initiative\nis also providing benefits to local people by improving\nfood and water security.\nThe WildAid Marine Programme are working towards the \u201830 by 30\u2019 target for protecting 30% of the\nplanet\u2019s biodiversity. The non-profit, which is the winner for \u2018Revive Our Oceans\u2019, is targeting marine protected areas, which are typically more difficult to manage\nand enforce than terrestrial habitats. Operating all over\nthe world, WildAid seeks to equip sustainable fisheries\nand marine protection agencies with the tools and technology to support their conservation goals.\nThe winning team for the \u2018Fix Our Climate\u2019 category are promoting regenerative agriculture; their name,\n\u2018Boomitra\u2019, means \u2018friend of the earth\u2019 in Sanskrit, and\nthis is exactly what they are \u2013 a \u2018soil carbon marketplace\u2019\nusing the concept of carbon credits to reward farmers\nfor implementing sustainable practices that improve\nsoil health. Healthy soil has the potential to store several gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, so incentivising\nthis could hugely benefit climate change mitigation.\nS4S Technologies is a start-up based in India who are\ncombatting food waste through supporting smallhold-er farms to preserve their produce for longer. The team\nparticularly focuses on empowering female farmers and\nentrepreneurs, and is even teaching them how to use\npreserved food waste to produce other commercial food\ngoods like ketchup.\nThe most exciting announcement for me personally\nis the winner for \u2018Clean Our Air\u2019, as they are based in my\nhome city, Hong Kong, and are also materials-focused.\nGreen, Renewable, Sustainable Technology (GRST) has\ncreated a more sustainable production line for lithi-um-ion batteries \u2013 a key component in electric vehicles\n\u2013 by binding the materials with a water-soluble compos-ite.

Before\nbecoming Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties), he held the roles of Sports\nSector Chair, and Sports Sector Treasurer,\ngiving him a wealth of experiences to\ndraw upon.\nCooper says his experiences in the\nUnion shaped his time at Imperial\nprofoundly. He is studying for a degree\nin Mechanical Engineering \u2013 a choice he\nmade \u201cmainly because I had an interest\nin Maths and Physics and wanted to do\nsomething that would apply those.\u201d\nBut now, in large part due to his roles at\nImperial College Union (ICU), he says he\nwould like to pursue a career in \u201ccharity,\nrepresentation or law, or something\nsimilar\u201d.\nHe remembers the moment it was first\nput to him that he might be a fit for the\nDPCS role. \u201cI was sitting in this exact\nroom actually, in March 2022.\u201d [Cooper\nand I are in a meeting room in the Union\nBuilding].\n\u201cWe were budgeting for sports clubs\nand the then-DPCS India [Marsden] was\njoking with me. She said, \u2018You\u2019ll be doing\nmy job in a couple of years\u2019 time.\u2019 And\nlook at me now!\u201d\nCooper had his first introduction to\nthe Union as part of Hockey Club. \u201cI\nknew I wanted to play hockey when I\njoined Imperial \u2013 I played at school, and\nfor a club in Newcastle, where I\u2019m from,\nas well.\u201d\n\u201cSo I decided to join Imperial College\nHockey Club. I didn\u2019t know that it was\naffiliated with the Union. To be honest, I\ndidn\u2019t really know what unions were, and\nmy first proper experience of the Union\nwas a social after a hockey match.\u201d\n\u201cAt the time, a couple of people on my\nteam were volunteers with the Union, so\nthey were the ones who explained what\nit was.\u201d\n\u201cI was just one of the lucky ones,\u201d\nadmits Cooper, acknowledging that\nthe Union could do more to explain its\nfunction. \u201cMany students don\u2019t quite\nunderstand and think clubs and societies\nare run by the College.\u201d\nIn 2021/22 he ran for a role on the\nSports Sector Management Group.\nThe Union\u2019s Management Groups are\nrun by student volunteers, and act as an\nintermediarybetweentheclubs,societies\nand projects (CSPs) within their sector,\nand the Union\u2019s more senior leadership.\nThey provide a first line of support and\nassist with basic governance and finance,\nescalating larger student concerns to the\nUnion\u2019s permanent staff or the relevant\nOTs.\nSeeing that the Treasurer position was\nunfilled, Cooper decided to run, and won.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the most glamorous thing in\nthe world. There\u2019s a lot of day-to-day stuff\nlike approving financial requests, but the\nbig thing that kept me doing it was seeing\nthat I actually had an impact.\u201d\nHe relates the story of his first big\nsuccess in the role. \u201cI joined the sports\nexec near the end of Covid in 2021. And\nthe social nights, the ACCs [monthly\nsports nights arranged by the Sports\nSector Management Group] were\ncompletely gone \u2013 they hadn\u2019t run for\ntwo years.\u201d\n\u201cSo myself and the rest of the exec\nteam put so much effort into the first\nHalloween sports night. And it was a\nhuge success. They\u2019ve just built upon it\nsince then, and it\u2019s become really good\nagain.\u201d\nThen in January 2022, Cooper became\nacting Sports Sector Chair due to\n\u201cunforeseen circumstances\u201d.\n\u201cI was singlehandedly doing the\nSports Treasurer and Sports Chair roles.\nThe next academic year we managed to\nfill the whole executive, which was good,\nand I was formally elected to Sports\nChair.\u201d\nFrom here, the DPCS role was a\nnatural transition. \u201cOver the past year\n(2022/23), I got a lot more involved in the\nrepresentation side of things, and started\nto consider it much more seriously. To\nthe point where I was seeing Dylan [DPCS\n2022/23] quite regularly, seeing the work\nhe was doing and imagining myself\ndoing that.\u201d\n\u201cWorking with Dylan was the moment\nwhere I thought, \u2018Oh, I could really do\nthis.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAs much as the Sports Chair role is\nrewarding, you do feel like you can\u2019t\ndedicate enough time to it \u2013 any student\nin a volunteering role will tell you the\nsame.\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to have a bigger impact and\nhad loads of ideas about how I wanted\nto change things from my previous\nexperience.\u201d\nCooper says he works a lot with DPFS\nStephanie Yeung on a day-to-day basis.\n\u201cOur roles are intrinsically intertwined \u2013\nsocieties make up a huge portion of the\nUnion\u2019s finances, and Stephanie oversees\nour finances.\n\u201cWe often talk about the many\nhats,\u201d he says when I ask him about the\nresponsibilities of his role. \u201cThe hat that\nnever comes off is my job as a trustee of\nImperial College Union. What this means\nis that above all else, I have to make sure\nwe\u2019re sticking to our charitable objectives\nand that we\u2019re running effectively and\nresponsibly.\u201d\n\u201cBut then in my elected role \u2013 the\n\u2018officer\u2019 part of \u2018officer trustee\u2019, my\nmain responsibilities are to act as\na representative, to ensure that I\u2019m\nlistening to students and actually\nactioning their feedback \u2013 not just doing\nmy own projects, which is the third hat.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that my own personal\nadvocacy projects are well-received by\nstudents, but I\u2019ve got to be cognisant of\nthe fact that I\u2019m not currently a student,\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nIn this series, Felix talks to the\nUnion\u2019s Officer Trustees.

While the set\nwas minimal and initially off-putting, in the end it\nhardly mattered as the actors believed a hospital,\nmuseum, and a maze-like, booby-trapped basement\nwas onstage, so the audience believed it too. The songs\n\u2018Little Proposition\u2019 and the titular \u2018Final Heist\u2019 were\nparticularly catchy, but it is admittedly difficult to pick\nout the brightest stars in a sky full of them. All in all, the\nmusical came across as a fun-filled conversation about\nself-belief and self-destruction in a world like our own,\nbut better. A half star has to be knocked off for the fact\nthat The Final Heist is not on its way to the West End at\nthe time of printing.\nThe production team must have all been crazy\nor inspired, but they certainly created something\nunforgettable. It took a producer, (Meg Spiteri) an\nassistant producer (Basit Khan), a stage manager (Pip\nMoss), a lighting designer doubling as an assistant\nstage manager (Jarek Ciba), a lighting operator (Rachel\nGeorge), two sound designers (Ka Jun Cheng and Joshua\nHenry) and a set and props designer (Liberty Wright) to\npull the October Show off. Congratulations are in order.\nAcknowledgement should be given to the minor\nmiracle that involved building an entirely new stage on\notherwise this newspaper would become an unending\nloop of a story about his brother-in-law.\nTo summarise, there were times when baffled\nfascination morphed into a feeling of agonised desperation for some scenes to finally come to an end (though\nIonesco may have intended for this all along), but other\ntimes when the audience was left in stitches at the farce\nthat was being spun out of polite English society. The\nacting was superb: the Fire Chief\u2019s self-satisfaction was\nperfect, and Mrs. Smith\u2019s volatility fitted wonderfully\nwith the script.\nAfter the much-needed interval, MTSoc\u2019s The\nFinal Heist began. An original student-written\nmusical by Aleera Ewan (exquisitely interspersed with\norchestrations by Solen Marqueste, assisted by\nHannan Seyal), The Final Heist follows the story of Mia\n(Cecilia Longoni), a lapsed professional thief, trying to\ntakeupthemantleofherolderbrother(GabrielSwallow)\nby robbing a highly sought-after poem. An enjoyably\nsuspicious character going by the pseudonym the\nCollector (Jonah McDonald) tempts Mia into getting\nher close-knit group of specialised thieves back in the\nbusiness by offering her a million dollars to steal the\npoem, desperate for no one else to read it but him.\nMia\u2019s team, who had codenames such as the Spider\n(Aanaya Miah), the Acrobat (Dana Whigan) and the\necoy (Harry McCarthy), embarked on pulling off the last\nheist of their careers, evading security guards and lasers\nthrough brilliantly executed song and dance (credit due\nto Amy Thornton, choreographer). As well as allowing\neach of them to shine, Ewan revealed the flaws and fears\n\n"

Yet, there is nothing like it. Often there\nare neither railings nor wooden bridges to guide the\nexploration \u2013 only ice and rock for the mountaineers to\nscramble up on, requiring a level of expertise and sangfroid not common to Imperial students. So, meet Elliot,\na third year Mathematics PhD student, who went on a\nthree week expedition with five other post-graduate\nstudents to the Purcell Mountains in British Columbia,\nCanada out of a pure enjoyment of mountain climbing.\nThe choice of Canada as the destination was not ar-bitrary. The Bugaboos, with their spiked mountainous\nterrain, presented a thrilling challenge. Elliot explained\nthat the decision to venture outside Europe added an\nelement of novelty to the expedition. The Bugaboos,\nhe noted, were unique, offering an experience distinct\nfrom the familiar European landscapes.\nOrganising such an adventure is no small feat, particularly when the participants are not well acquainted.\nThe first meeting, a five a.m. rendezvous at the airport,\nmarked the beginning of a journey that required meticulous planning and financial commitment. Flights were\n\u00a3750 per person and additional expenses added up, but\na family member of Elliot in Alberta alleviated some\nof the financial burdens. Luckily, all was granted in advance by Imperial\u2019s own Expedition Board.\nFor Elliot, a climber with three to four years of expe-rience, this expedition was a departure from previous\nsummer tours. Bosnia, the destination of the previous year, was overshadowed by the sheer wilderness\nand challenges of the Bugaboos. The trip, while begin-ner-friendly, demanded keenness and adaptability. Elliot pointed out that for those inclined towards a more\nstrenous, alpinist-style climbing, places like Chamonix\nin France might be more suitable.\nHowever, with the thrill came challenges, and one\nmemorable aspect was the arduous approach to the\nBugaboos.

This idea perpetuates itself\nin art, literature and philosophy, which\n(again ironically) are some of the few media through which men have been able\nto reveal their intimate thoughts. The\nWestern canon is dominated by men,\nand works by men focus predominantly\non ideas rather than feelings. Maleness\nis associated with thinking and ration-ality, and the male protagonists of many\nof these books represent ideologies and\nsocial movements, instead of being people of their own right, with all the messy\nemotions beneath them.\nSimilarly,thetorturedgeniusisatrope\nto this day most associated with men,\nprimarily due to sexist attitudes that led\nto women\u2019s contributions and suffering\nbeing overlooked. Think of writers such\nas Hemingway, artists like Van Gogh, lyricists like Kurt Cobain. There is a \u2018great\ncanon\u2019 of sad men who channel their experiences into beautiful pieces of litera-ture, whether that is novels, essays, their\npersonal diaries, or lyrics. Similar to the\nWestern canon, male suffering is present\nonly to represent an idea - in this case,\nthe idea of the genius.\nModernist literature flips this status\nquo on its head: the works of Kafka and\nDostoyevsky (one of my personal favourite \u2018sad men\u2019) are lauded not just because\noftheirtechnicalabilityinwriting.Kafka,\nwith his obscure prose involving winding sentences, which even in translations\nmirror the claustrophobic, red-tape-lad-en worlds his stories take place in, is able\nto present his alienation with society, and\nnervousness and tension within.\nDostoyevsky with his wry humour and\nvivid descriptions of the slums of St. Petersburg captures similar sentiments of\nalienation, but his standout characters\nsuch as the Underground Man capture\nexactly what it feels like to be bullied and\nsocially isolated. When I was 15 and a\nmess of anxiety, bullying and self-loath-ing, I finally felt understood when I read\nCrime and Punishment. Raskolnikov, the\nprotagonist, was like a mirror - a former\nstudent tormented by the notion that he\nhad to achieve success; that, in his egoistic worldview, he alone was to rise up\nand be a great man. I understood exactly how it was like to be in that situation.\nThat burning desire within me to become\nknown and rise above my school peers\nwho bullied me, despite being top of the\nclass (this is important not because I demand your academic validation, but because Raskolnikov was the same within\nthe social makeup of the student class he\nbelonged to) was for once validated. I had\nnever felt seen in such a raw and vivid\nway before.\nAs James Baldwin eloquently put it:\n\u2018You read something which you thought\nonly happened to you, and you discover\nthat it happened 100 years ago to Dostoyevsky. This is a very great liberation\nfor the suffering, struggling person, who\nalways thinks that he is alone.\u2019\nTrauma, unspoken of by men, is\nbrought up in literature authored by\nmales both implicitly and explicitly.\nNabokov, who himself was sexually\nabused as a child, went on to write Lolita.\nKafka, emotionally abused by his father,\nexpresses themes of social pressure, or\nthe oppression from a vague patriarchal\nfigure - whether that be the protagonist\u2019s\nfather in the short story The Judgement,\nor the entire court apparatus in The Trial.\nErnest Hemingway\u2019s prose is known for\nits short, clipped, matter-of-fact nature,\nwriting from a man who saw the horrors of the Great War firsthand.

This meant joining a host of societies\n\u2013 some I stuck with, others, I ended up dropping. One\nof my regrets was not remaining more involved with\nstudent journalism. Upon arrival, I quickly joined my\nschool\u2019s publication. I enjoyed writing and was eager to\nmeet other students passionate about social issues and\ncurrent affairs. However, what I found was something\nall too common with student publications \u2013 an irregular\npublication schedule, a cliquish network unwelcom-ing to newcomers, and a lack of structure. I would have\nloved to write for an outlook like the BBC or the Economist, but this was impractical at my school.\nWell, unavailable until now. I recently became familiar with The Sunday Diplomat, an online media start-up\nfounded by Si Kai Feng, a student studying in the UK.\nFeng entered his sixth form and was met with similar\nfrustrations. Whereas I moved on, he founded The Sunday Diplomat, initially with a group of friends from other sixth-form schools in the UK. A year later, the news\noutlet has grown massive and now boasts forty writers\nand editors from all six continents as the staff of a now\nofficially incorporated company. Publishing daily, and\nfeaturing strict writing guidelines, The Sunday Diplomat\nresembles more a professional outlook like Vice, or even\nThe Economist, than a student publication. Arguably,\nits website looks even more professional than the Daily\nMail\u2019s.\nThey have also gathered a mass following. With\ntens of thousands of readers from over a hundred\ncountries, they are now the largest sixth-form\npublication in the nation, surpassing traditional\nschool-backed juggernauts like Etonomics. The\nSunday Diplomat is now discussing expanding to other\nverticals such as entertainment and formats like\nYouTube or podcasts.\nThe success of The Sunday Diplomat should\nencourage other sixth formers to undertake similar\nprojects, building organizations across schools,\ncountries, and even continents. A global outlook\nprovides unique opportunities for students to\nauthentically experience the journalism industry,\nacquiring invaluable work experience and skills, while\navoiding the pitfalls that occur when the environment\nof a single school is too small to support regular and\nrigorous publication. It can help with inspiring our\nyouth to pursue a career in journalism, supporting this\ncrucial industry that regulates the government and\nexposes corruption \u2013 an industry that is facing an acute\nshortage of writers today.\nThe UK and the world need more projects like The\nSunday Diplomat to give voice to the next generation of\nthinkers. If you want to learn more about the project\nwhich re-imagines what sixth-form journalism in the UK\ncan be, consider giving thesundaydiplomat.com a visit.\nCommentWriter\nMAHEDY BASHER\nThe Sunday Diplomat provides a space for young journalists to grow Mahedy Basher\n\n"

The College has been\napproached for comment.\n\u201cThe two issues at stake here are academic freedom\nand international engagement,\u201d said Josh Freeman, Policy\nManager at the Higher Education Policy Institute. \u201cThese\nvalues are both core to UK higher education but, as this case\nshows, are sometimes contradictory.\u201d\nIn July this year, one of Germany\u2019s largest universities, the\nUniversity of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg, suspended its own CSC\nscholarship programme, citing concerns around \u2018industrial\nespionage.\u2019\n\u2018The reason behind this decision is that these CSC students\nsign a contract in which they pledge absolute allegiance to\nthe state, as well as undertaking to remain in contact with the\nChinese embassy at all times,\u2019 wrote the university in a letter\nto its staff.\nA similar private contract between the CSC and its scholars,\nobtained by Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute, stated that two\nguarantors are obliged to repay the entire scholarship, should\nthe recipient breach its terms.\nIt commits scholarship recipients to \u2018regularly submit a\n\u201cSituation Report\u201d to the Chinese embassy\u2019 and \u2018participate in\nannual PhD student reviews\u2019 there.

Every\nyear, the speech outlines which laws the\ngovernment is set to pass over the next\nyear. This year\u2019s speech announced the\nOffshore Petroleum Licensing Bill, which\nif passed would mandate the North Sea\nTransition Authority to hold licensing\nrounds for exploring North Sea oil and\ngas at least once a year. Prime Minister\nRishi Sunak believes that drilling North\nSea oil and gas will make the UK\u2019s energy supply more secure by reducing im-ports. The compulsory annual licensing\nrounds will proceed if the UK meets two\nconditions \u2013 being a net importer of fossil fuels, and its carbon emissions from\nextracting and refining British gas being\nless than imported gas.\nHowever, the carbon emissions from\nburning this gas or oil are not mentioned\nin the bill. The International Energy\nAgency said in their 2021 report that no\nnew oil and gas fields are compatible\nwith net zero by 2050, so critics think the\nOffshore Petroleum Licensing Bill shows\nthe government\u2019s unwillingness to meet\ninternational climate goals. If the UK exports any new fossil fuels it extracts, not\nonly will domestic energy security be un-affected, but the carbon emissions from\nburning them will not count against the\nUK\u2019s net zero plans as well. The UK currently exports 80% of its North Sea oil.\nChris Skidmore, Chair of the UK\u2019s Net\nZero Review, opposed the bill in the parliamentary debate following the King\u2019s\nSpeech. \u201cI cannot be put in a place of supporting new oil and gas licensing when\nthis is not needed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know\nI\u2019m not some eco-extremist because I\nsigned net zero into law, which is the very\nbare minimum we could do.\u201d\nGiven that the Labour Party\u2019s green energy strategy includes ending North Sea\ngas exploration, critics view the Offshore\nPetroleum Licensing Bill as a stunt to get\nvotes at the expense of the planet. The\nbill joins this government\u2019s recent string\nof controversial environmental decisions\n\u2013 notably the approval of the Rosebank\noil field in the North Sea, the five-year\ndelay on banning petrol and diesel cars,\nand opposition to expanding the London\nUltra Low Emission Zone.\nIn the King\u2019s Speech, His Majesty\nsaid, \u201cThis Bill will support the future\nlicensing of new oil and gas fields, helping the country to transition to net zero\nby 2050 without adding undue burdens\non households.\u201d This sounded unusual given His Majesty has advocated for\nour planet as Prince of Wales since 1970\n\u2013 when he spoke of a \u201cgrowing menace\nof oil pollution at sea, which ... destroys\ntens of thousands of sea birds.\u201d However,\nwhether or not His Majesty personally\nopposes the fossil fuel exploration bill\nhe was made to read out last week will\nprobably never be made public. King\nCharles will also deliver an opening address at COP28. The Sustainable Markets\nInitiative, a coalition of private enterprises founded by His Majesty, is a strategic\npartner of the COP28 Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum running parallel to the main conference.\nAlthough the King is passionate about\nsustainability, the monarchy and fossil\nfuel industry both have bad reputations\namong some for overexploiting natural\nresources and hoarding wealth. Therefore, I wanted to conduct a study to find\nout if opinions on the monarchy and the\nenvironment are related. Last Thursday,\nI asked 60 Imperial College students on\nwhether they support the monarchy\nand whether they support new oil and\ngas projects. 29 (48.3%) students condemned new oil and gas projects \u2013 of\nwhich 15 were against the monarchy and\neight supported the monarchy. Of the 16\n(26.7%) students who supported new oil\nand gas, five were against the monarchy\nand another five supported the monar-chy. The remaining 15 (25.0%) students\ndid not express strong opinions on either\nthe monarchy or new oil and gas, with\nseven feeling neutral about both topics.\nThe significance of a pompous ceremony to open Parliament and the importance of ending fossil fuel exploration\nwill both be debated for years. But if one\nof the most respected people in the world\ncannot prevent possibly planet-wrecking\nlaws, who will? Perhaps William, Prince\nof Wales will have a greater role as the\nmonarchy\u2019s environmental steward. One\nof the best examples of Prince William\nsupporting green initiatives was held on\nthe same day as his father\u2019s speech \u2013 see\nthe next page for more.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001c\u001e\u001a\u001b\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001b\n\u0013\u0012\u001a\u001a\u0011\u001e\u001b\u0010\u001a\u001d\u0017\u0014\u001b\u000f\u000e \u001b\n\u000f\u000e\u0014\u0014\u0018 \u001b\u000f \u001a \u0014\nfelixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\nfelixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial \u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0019\u0016\u001d\u0015\u0014\u0015\u0013\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0019\u0016\u001d\u0015\u0014\u0015\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\u001a\u001a\u0011\u001e\u001b\u0010\u001a\u001d\u0017\u0014\u001b\u000f\u000e \u001b\nLast week, King Charles \u2013 an avid\nenvironmentalist \u2013 read out a bill to\nincrease oil and gas extraction.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u001f\u0015\u001c\u0017\u001a\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001d\u0018\u001d\u0017\u0016\u001b\u001e\u0015\u0017\u001a\u0014\u0013\n\u001a\u001d\u0012\u001b\u0011\u001a\u0010\u000f\u001a\u000e \u0018\u001d\u0018 \u001a \u0016\u001e\u001b\u001b\u0016\u001a \u0018\b\u001a\u0007\u001d\u0017\u001a\u0019 \u0006\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0005\u001a\u0004\u0003\u001b\u001a\u0002\u001d\u0018 \u0011\u001a\u001a\u0001\u0018\b\u001b\u001e\u001a \u0018\u001a\u0014\u007f\u001b\u0018\u001a\u0081 \u008d\u001b\u001e\u0018\u001c\u001b\u0018\u0016\u001a\n\u008f\u001d\u0012\u001b\u0018\u0012\u001b\u001a\u0090\u001a\u009d\u0018\u008d \u0016 \u001a\u009d \u001b\u001c\u001b\u0018\u0016\u0017\u001a\u0090\u001a\u00ad\u0080\b \u001c \b\u0005\u001a\u0082\u0082\u001a\u0083\u0084 \u00ad\u001a\u0086\u0087\u000f\u001a\u0090\u001a\u0081 \u001e\u0005\u001a\u0083\u001b\u001c\u0080\u001e\u001d\b \u001b\u001a\u0082\u0082\u001a\u0083\u0084\u001a\u0088\u0087\u000f\n\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001a\u0018\u0017\u001d\u0016\u001a\u0015\u0014\u001d\u0019\u0013\u0015\u001d\u0012\u0011\n\u001d\u0017\u0013\u0010\u001b\u0015\u001d\u000f\u0015\u0019\u001b\u0010\u000e\u0015 \u001d \u001a\u0018\u0015 \u0017\u001a \u001d\n\b\u001a\u000e\u000e\u001d\u0007\u0017\u001d\u0007\u001d\u0017\u0019 \u0019\u001d\u0019\u0010\u001d \u0015\u0019\u001d\u0016\u0010\u0019\u0015\u0017\u001d\u0007\u0019\u001d\u0019\u0013\u0015\u001d\u0015\u0006\u0005\u0015 \u0017\u0015\u001d\u0010\u0004\u001d\n\u0019\u0013\u0015\u001d\u0005\u000e\u0007 \u0015\u0019\u0003\n\u201c\n\n"

He hopes that Imperial will increase its\nblock grant as a result, providing more money to recruit\nmore admin staff.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at being a high-performing union, and\nwith that comes an ask for more funding and support.\u201d\nHe also says the Union\u2019s commercial services (bars\nand venues) are \u201cgetting better and better\u201d, and that this\nwill increase income.\nCooper\u2019s goals\nCooper is clearly ambitious; he describes a number of\ngoals for the year, some of which fall outside of what is\nstated on his Union webpage.\nOne of his most wide-reaching goals is to improve\nsupport for CSP members. The Union is introducing a host\nof new workshops this year, and has already run successful\ncommittee and welfare workshops training sessions.\nFurthermore, Cooper says that online training courses\nwill be moved to a new digital platform, which will also\nallow students to report their concerns directly to staff.\nHe says he wants the Union to be more transparent, and\nto that end, meets regularly with students to \u201clay all the\ncards on the table\u201d.\nHe also wants to try and make voluntary roles more\n\u201crelevant\u201d, and to recognise contributions with a new\nreward system.\n\u201cWe want to create a volunteering experience that allows\npeople personally develop, and not just be sitting on a\nfinance system approving claims, for example.\u201d\nHetalkspassionatelyofaplantodiversifythecommittees\nof student societies. \u201cI was pulling some data last week,\nand compared to the overall student demographic, clubs\nand societies are more populated by home students and\nundergraduates\u201d\nFor Cooper, the diversification plan goes beyond his own\nrole. By diversifying committees, he feels he can empower\nunderrepresented groups to shape societies to their\nrepresent their own interests, thereby improving the overall\nImperial student experience.\nHe is clearly driven to make his mark, talking in great\ndepth about the Union\u2019s sustainability policy, projects he\nis running with Move Imperial, plans to reduce barriers to\nparticipation, and more.\nUnfortunately, we do not have the space to discuss them\nall in this piece, and so Felix refers readers to Cooper\u2019s blog\nposts on the ICU website, where he will be sharing all his\nwork throughout the year.\nCooper feels that the cost-of-living crisis is the biggest\nchallenge facing the Union, in relation to his own role.\n\u201cStudents can\u2019t afford to spend as much money, and\nrunning activities is more expensive than ever. So for clubs\nand societies, and the Union as a whole, it\u2019s going to be a\nreally big challenge to see how we can save money, and how\nwe can use what we have more effectively.\u201d\nHe says the best way to get involved in the Union is \u201cto\ngo on our website and find a few things you really like. Just\ntry them out, and when you do join a club, talk to people on\ncommittee, and say, why have you chosen do to this role?\nWhat made you want to, and what did you get out of it?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll probably find there are a few positions you\u2019re\nintrigued by. And then, just run for them.\u201d\nSelina Ye\n\n"

However, the use of 0 is more\nrecent than you might expect.\nSurprisingly, many societies\nlived without the need for\n0 for a long time. From the\nevidence we have, people\nfrom the past had no trouble living without at all.\nThe Babylonians, for example,\nrecorded numbers without even\na place holder. For example,\n\u201c2023\u201d was written as \u201c223\u201d. So,\nwhen did 0 come about, and how\ndid it become so important to\nmodern day science?\nSumerians,\nBabylonians, and the\nMayans\nThe origins of 0 can likely be\ndated back over 4000 years ago,\nwhere the Sumerians used gaps\nbetween numbers to denote absences (in the form \u201c2 23\u201d). However, it is likely that the Babylonians were the first to use a symbol\nfor the number 0 (in the form\n\u20182\u201d23\u2019). Surprisingly, this symbol was never used at the end of\na number, and they continued\nto determine the magnitude of\na number from its context. A\ndifferent symbol with the same\npurpose was developed in America around 350AD, where the Mayans used the drawing of a conch\nshell to represent 0 in their cal-endars.TheMayansbelievedthat\ntime is cyclical, and that events\nare destined to repeat. Due to\ntheir unique worldview, they\nused zero to represent both the\nbeginning and the end.\nBrahmagupta and\nAl-Khwarizmi\nThese uses of 0 remained as\na place holder, rather than a\nnumber on its own. The\nacknowledgement of 0 with\nits unique properties started to develop in the seventh\ncentury AD in India. Here,\nmathematicians not only used\nsmall dots to represent zero as\na place holder, but they also\nrecognized 0 as having the null\nvalue,namely,\u2018Sunya\u2019.Itisaround\nthis time that Indian mathemati-cian, Brahmagupta, showed that\nsubtracting a number from itself\nresulted in 0, and identified 0 as\nthe \u2018additive identity\u2019, meaning\na number add 0 gives you the\noriginal number. In the very\nsame book, he states that the\nproduct of 0 with any number\nis also 0. Although his understanding of dividing by 0 is very\ndifferent from the modern one,\nhis work on 0 as well as many\nother areas of mathematics\nsuch as Algebra, had a significant impact on the development\nof mathematics. From India,\nBrahmagupta\u2019s understanding\nof 0 made its way into Chinese\nmathematics and eventually into the Middle East, where\nmathematician Al-Khwarizmi\nstudied Indian arithmetic and\nbegan linking it to formulas\nhe called \u2018al-jabr\u2019, the etymology of modern word \u201cAlgebra\u201d.\nHe is responsible for introducing the Arabic numerals, and\nbegan giving zero the symbol \u20180\u2019, the oval shape we all\nfamiliar today.\nLiber Abaci\nZero then continued to migrate\naround the world before breaking into European mathematics\nduring the 1100s. Many Italian\nmathematicians attempted to\nintroduced 0 to the \u201cmainstream\nmathematics\u201d. In particular,\nFibonacci\u2019s book Liber Abaci gave\nmany applications to numbers\nincluding 0, writing about calculations such as money-chang-ing and commercial bookkeep-ing. His work was well accepted\nacross Europe and had a significant impact on European math-ematics. Since then, the concept\nof \u201cnothing\u201d became widely ac-cepted. Zero now plays a role in\nalmost every fields from physics\nto economics to computing.\nThroughout its development,\nzero is one of the most controversial ideas. In Ancient Greece,\nwhere all mathematics were\nbased on geometry, the idea of\n\u201cnothing\u201d meant there was no\ngeometrical correspondence,\nand hence, no math to ponder.\nEven till this day, mathematicians continue to debate over\nwhether to classify 0 as a natural\nnumber. However, it is undeniable that 0 has hold a crucial place\nin modern mathematics, and its\npresence should never be taken\nfor granted.\n1st\nyear mathematician\nJohn Zou delves into the\n4000 year history of the\nnumber 0.\nSCIENCE\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001c\u001b\u001c\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001e\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001b\u0013\u0012\u0018\u001b\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001e\u001c\u0015\u001b\u0017\u0018\u0011\u0017\u0018\u0015\u0018\u001c\u0010\u0018\u000f\u001b\u0010\u0012\u0018\u001b\u001c\u001a\u0019\u000e\u0018\u0017\u001b \u001b\u001a\u0015 \u001c \u001b\u001e\u001b \u001c \u0012\u001b\u0015\u0012\u0018\u0016\u0016\u0014 \b\u0017\u001a \u0010\u0011\u001a\u001c \u0012\u0016 \u001c\u0018\u001b\u0007\u001b\u0006 \u0005 \u0019\u0018\u000f \u001e\u001b\u0004 \u0019\u0019 \u001c\u0015\n\u0003\u0010\u001e\u0010\u001a\u0018\u001b \u0002\u001b\u0001\u0018\u0017\u0015 \u001e\u001c\u001b\u0011 \u0016\u001d\u0019\u001e\u0010\u0012\u001b\u001e\u001c\u000f\u001b\u0002\u001e\u0010\u0012\u0018\u0017\u001b \u0002\u001b\u007f\u0016 \u0018\u000e\u0017\u001e\u0081\u001b\u007f\u0016\u008d\u008f\u0012\u0090\u001e\u0017 \u009d\u0019 \u0014\n\u007f\u000f\u001e\u0019\u001b \u001e\u0017\u001e\u001c \u009d\u00ad\n\n"

In present day, Marina Abramovi\u0107 has\nproduced and directed an operatic exhibition into the\nvibrancy, sexuality and fortitude that Maria brought to\nher numerous operatic roles.\nThe production featured well known arias such as\nThe Habenera by Bizet, Un bel d\u00ec, vedremo by Puccina,\nand, of course, Casta Diva by Bellini within a collection of vignettes; each aria sung masterfully by a suite\nof expert and talented operatic stars who sensitively\nbrought forth a banquet for the ears. Accompanying\neach aria was a short film segment directed by and\nstarring Abramovi\u0107 herself alongside actor Willem\nDafoe. The films themselves complemented the\narias in both their sensuality and their dramatic\ncharacter; although, at points, one could argue\nthat they appeared to be over-indulgent in tone. At\nseveral points, particularly during the arias from\nMadame Butterfly and Tosca, it detracted\nfrom the appreciation of the music in favour of\ncinematographic excellence. Moreover, at\npoints one lost meaning of what the films\nwere trying to convey, an issue which was\nparticularly apparent during the Casta Diva\nsegment where the roles are reversed and a Dafoe in\ndrag plays the role of Norma instead, it is not clear, of\ncourse, why this artistic liberty was taken, and, in trying\nto ponder such reasonings, it offered merely as a distraction from the beautiful singing of Sophie Bevan.\nWhat made this production shine, however, is its\nfinal vignette, \u2018Maria Callas dies of a broken heart\u2019. The\ncomposer Marko Nikodijevi\u0107 beautifully weaved a\ntextured orchestration for the final vignette which\nintermingled quotations and motifs form all the the\narias performed previously into a chaotic stream of\nconsciousness which complemented the live\nacting and speech provided by Abramovi\u0107. We observe\nher final moments as she tries to rationalise whether\nshe is dead or alive, and reflects back at her friends\nand relations who have since left her alone in her\napartment \u2013 a wonderfully created scene which ends\nwith Abramovi\u0107 on stage with a recording of the diva\nherself singing Casta Diva, which ends abruptly as the\nstage turns to black.\nThroughout the production, one constantly rides a\nrollercoaster of emotions from start to finish, and\nsees new light being brought to these staple arias\nperformed by Callas, invigorated by carnality,\nmortality and melancholy, all of which build up to the\nfinal moments as we see the diva herself experience the\nemotions of her characters one by one. While it is\npossible to feel distracted from the music being\nperformed, and certain artistic liberties have been\ntaken both with the life of Callas and with the story\ntelling of the arias themselves, it is no doubt a\nproduction of epic proportions and one which triumphs\nin its overall ingenuity.\nMarina\nAbramovi\u0107 at the\nRoyal Academy\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001d\u0019\u0018\u001a\u001c\u001b\u001e\u001a\n\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001d\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001d\u0017\u001e\u001b\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\nA review of Marina\nAbramovi\u0107\u2019s 7 Deaths of\nMaria Callas\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001e\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001d\u001e\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001c\u0014\u001a\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0013\u0012\u0011\u001a\u001d\u0016\u0010\u0011\u001a\u0016\u000f\u001a\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001e\u001a\u000e\u001e\u0010\u0010\u001e \u001a \u001d\u001c \u0013\u001d\u001e\u0017\u001a \u0011\u001b\u0013\u0016\u001b\n\n"

This simple system satisfied the study of\ncomputer science until more information was encoded\ninto a more efficient system \u2013 introduce the Hexadecimal. Now instead of an on-off system, there were 16 op-tions: 0 to F. The binary system, despite still being the\nfundamental way to encode information into hardware,\nis not applicable to our society. The binary system of\nclassifying our people and diverse range of humans that\nlive together in the community of our earth is outdated,\neven if it is fundamental to our digital world.\nHe, She or They\nSurveys in the 21st century now include a third gender option. Despite the multiple different gender identities present in our society, including them all would add\na level of complexity to our data processing algorithms\nthat we may not be equipped with to handle. I am all for\nincluding every gender and sexual identity into surveys\nbecause they best represent the diversity we surround\nourselves with. But processing all that data introduces\nso many independent variables and categories that we\nwould need to gather a lot of data for each category.\nAs an example, take running a half-marathon.\nLast weekend, I ran one and I checked the times on-line. Nowadays, marathons split their achievement\ngroups into male, female, and non-binary, which is\nwonderful and balanced. With this system, men can\ncompare their times to 300 other runners \u2013 however, the\nnon-binary group only had two runners. The data was\nslim. The question I pose is if we added all genders into\nthe half-marathon category, would this aid our society\nin becoming more inclusive, at the cost of lowering the\nquantity of specific data we have?\nAll-or-nothing in diet\nOn another note, let\u00b4s talk about veganism and dietary requirements. Even if we listed all requirements\ninto a survey, there is still a degree of \u201coff or on\u201d. For ex-ample, you may classify yourself as a vegan, yet you still\ncan enjoy that one parmigiano cheese from your home\ncountry - a level of complexity added into the equation.\nAre you full Vegan? No. Vegetarian? Not really. You still\nabstain from all other animal products but not all.\nThe binary concept of all-or-nothing, which is an\nunbalanced and unhealthy way to approach life, has\nbecome so rooted into our society that we feel a need to\nconstrict ourselves to labels. There is no directionality.\nTake my friend Michael, who is a directional vegan. He\ndrinks coconut milk and eats coconut yoghurt, but he\nloves cheddar cheese and milk chocolate. He does not\neat meat or fish from the industry, but he may go for a\nfreshly fished cod from the backyard pond. How would\nwe define that? I thought of perhaps using the vector\nmath with each independent category being represented by a orthogonal axis and the person as a vector. This\nallows a spectrum to be applied in multiple dimensions.\nAre spectrums a solution?\nThe concept of orienting on a spectrum already exists in the conversation regarding on sexuality. The label bisexual does not always define a 50-50 split of love\nand attraction to males and females. Instead, it could\nmean a 30-70 or 90-10 split, whichever way you wish to\ndefine it. It also does not include the variable of time.\nIf we graphed our sexuality over time, for some of us it\nmay just be a constant horizontal line. But for others, in\nan abstract sense, it may be a curve: quadratic, cubic or\nwhatever complex shape it might take. I would be interested to see how individuals feel about broadening the\nlabels existing within our society and if the majority pri-oritises simplicity over specificity or vice versa.\nIn the defence of choosing simplicity, it allows us to\nloose the sharp edges that categorise us. On the other\nhand, specificity makes the data we gain about our society so much more interesting. Furthermore, within\neach label, would we be able to add a range? Instead of\ndefining oneself as a 100 percent Swede, can we split our\nnationalities into a pie? Within our generation it is very\ncommon to meet half, mixed, born-here-lived-there\npeople that no longer live in the \u201con-off\u201d state of being\nthat we are so used to. It would be great if surveys asked\ntwo more questions in addition to the typical \u201cWhat is\nyour nationality?\u201d, for example, \u201cWhere did you grow\nup?\u201d and \u201cWhat culture do you best associate yourself\nwith?\u201d. Of course, a null option for the latter question\nshould also be fine for those international students that\nare split among so many cultures, that they do not find\nthemselves representing any of them.\nThis topic has long been debatable, and it will for sure\ncontinue to stick in my mind. I would be interested to\nhear other people\u2019s opinions \u2013 or better off, comments.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001c\u0018\u001b\u0017\u0016\u001b\u0015\u001c\u001b\n\u0015\u001e\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\u001b\u0010\u001b\u001e\u0017\u001b\u0014\u0016\u001b\u000f\u0016\u0014\u000e\u001c\u0012\u001b\n\u0019 \u0016\u001a\u000f\u0018\nCOMMENT\nWe must move on from our black and white\napproach in seeing the world towards a\nhexadecimal one\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001a\u001c\u0017\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001d\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001b\u0015\u001c\u0014\u0019\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0010\u001c\u0014\u000f\u001d\u001b\u001b\u001c\u000e\u0019\u0014\u001b\u0010\u001e\u001d\u0012\u001b \u0015\u001c \u001b\u001c\u000e\u0019\u0011\u001c\u0010\u001d\u0019\u0017\u000f\u001c\u0014\u000f\u001b\u0018\u001c\u001e\u0011\u001c\u0019\u001c \u001c\n\u0017\u0016\u001e\u0014\u0015\u001c \u0012\u0014\u000f\u001c\u001b\u0019\u000e\u000f\u001c\u001e\u001d\u0014\u000f\u001e\u0010\u001e\u0011\u0019\u0016\u001c\u0019\u001a\u0012 \u001c\u001d\u001b\u0017\u001d\u001b \u001b\u0011\u0014\u0012\u0011\u0010\u001c\u0019\u001c\u0017\u001d\u001b\u000e\u001b\u0011\u0014\u0019\u0010\u001b\u001c \u001d\u001e\u0018\u001c\n\b\u0007\u0006\b\b\u0005\u001c\u0004\u001c \u001c\u0003\u001b\u000e\u0014\u001e\u001d\u001c\u0010\u0012\u0003\u001b \u001c\u0019\u001c\u0016\u001b\u0003\u001b\u0016\u001c\u001e \u001c\u0002\u0001\u0012\u001d\u001b\u000e\u0014\u0012\u001e\u0011\u0019\u0016\u0012\u0014\u007f\u0081\n\u0005\u001c\u008d\u0011\u001b\u001c\u0001\u0012\u0018\u001b\u0011 \u0012\u001e\u0011\u001c\n\u0017\u001b\u001d\u001c\u000e\u0019\u0014\u001b\u0010\u001e\u001d\u007f\u001c\u000e\u0019\u0011\u001c\u0010\u0012\u0003\u001b\u001c\u0019\u001c \u0017\u001b\u000e\u0014\u001d\u008f\u0018\u001c\u001e\u0011\u001c\u001b\u0019\u000e\u000f\u001c\u0019 \u0017\u001b\u000e\u0014\u001c\u001e \u001c\u001e\u008f\u001d\u001c\u0016\u0012 \u001b \u0014\u007f\u0016\u001b\u0005\u001c\n\n"

There is no traffic noise, besides\nthe sounds of wheels on tracks, though\ntaxpayer money goes towards making\nsure there is minimal squeaking and\nscreeching (unlike on the underground)\n\u2013 or better yet, investment in superconductor maglev technology has made rail tracks\no b s o l e t e and the network\nis breathtak- ingly quiet. It\nis powered by electricity,\nwhich, by now, is generated\nentirely from re- newable\nsources, and so you\nwhen you breathe in,\nthe air feels clean and\ncrisp, and your lungs are happier for it. You exchange smiles with your\nfellow commuters, and don\u2019t mind strik-ingupconversationwithregularsonyour\nroute. In fact, your community generally\nfeels friendlier and fuller of life. The reliable nature of the trams means you can\nafford to feel relaxed on your journey and\nbide your time reading or enjoying the\nlocal wildlife, which has been somewhat\nrestored. Occasional\ndelays are in-evitable, but\na collective\nu n d e r -standing of\nthis fact, as\nwell as workdays being staggered and hybrid working continued,\nmean that\nyou rarely get in trouble for being a little late. The tram windows can be rolled\ndown in summer and there is heating\nduring the winter, and the fares are eq-uitable, making the system accessible to\nall.\nAccording to a report from the UK\nDepartment of Transport, the transportation industry contributed the\nmost greenhouse gases of any sector\nin 2021. These largely consist of emissions produced by petrol and diesel\ncars, which emit more per passenger\nthan equivalent travel by public trans-portation. The two primary solutions to\nthis are adoption of electric vehicles or\na switch to modes of transport that are\nmore environmentally friendly, which\nincludes railways, underground trains,\nand buses, but also trams and light rail\nnetworks.\nUnfortunately, the utopian imagining\nof a London without private cars is unlikely to take hold across the whole city\nany time soon. However, there are a couple of light rail lines that function in the\nrealm between trains and trams; London\nTrams (previously Tramlink and Croydon\nTramlink) and the Docklands Light Railway. These are part of the larger Transport for London (TfL) network and service only specific areas of the city.\nMy own experience with trams comes\nfrom growing up in Hong Kong, where\na tram line introduced at the beginning\nof the twentieth century still operates\nthrough the city\u2019s central finance and\ncommerce hub. Though supplemented with an efficient underground\nsystem and walkable streets,\nthe trams remain\nan effective and mode of travel\nacross the district and are also celebrated\nas an icon of the city. It is described as the\n\u2018most affordable, convenient, and greenest public transport mode\u2019 Hong Kong\nhas to offer.\nTrams have major benefits in being\nhighly energy-efficient (more than most\ntransportation modes), sustainable over\nlong periods of time, and their rails can\npotentially be recyclable. They can also\nbe built to be longer than regular bus-es, so can carry more passengers. These\nqualities also lead to the additional benefit of having lower prices per passenger,\nmaking it affordable and accessible to a\nwide range of transport users.\nIn 2014, Edinburgh opened Edinburgh\nTrams, a modern version of the tram system they had over a century ago when\nroads used to be mixed mode and chaot-ic. The new trams run on isolated rails,\nso aren\u2019t hindered by other vehicles on\nthe road. Though slightly delayed in its\nopening, the tram network scored a 99%\nsatisfaction score in a\nsurvey carried out by\nWatchdog Transport\nFocus, and also made a profit two\nyears earlier than expected.\nMany European cities employ tram systems \u2013 Berlin,\nAmsterdam, Budapest, Lisbon, to name a few \u2013 and some\nUS cities like San Francisco and\nNew Orleans operate streetcars. The\npossibility of London similarly revolu-tionising its public transport network is\nsomething I often ponder, and it makes\nfor fun thought experiments like the one\nat the beginning of this article.\nAlas, this idealistic reality will\nlikely remain just that, due to the\nhuge infrastructure overhaul and the\namount of public engagement and commitment it would require.\nIf even a small fraction of the people\nwho drive a car to work opted for the Tube\nor buses instead, the resulting influx of\nactivity and pressure on public transport\nsystems could be a driver for TfL or the\nUK government to make more deliberate\nand long-lasting improvements to existing infrastructure. It might take a while\nto get to the point where we can think\nabout turning the dream of completely\nclean energy-based transportation into\nreality, but a change in behaviour among\ntransport users is needed now for a tram-filled London to become a future goal\nrather than an ideal.\nConverting roads into tram rails\ncould be revolutionary,\nso why aren\u2019t we doing it?\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\nrestored.
