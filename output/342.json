Union executive to pro test about the atrocious Refectory conditions which have prevailed since the beginning of this term. First of all, we were promised an ALL DAY snack bar in the Union building for Fresher s' Day. This type of\ncatering facility I feel was essential from our point of view and I would have thought profitable from yours. Instead of the snack bar, four ladies at least were commissioned at about12.00 to begin laying out biscuits on plates for Fresh ers'Te a, which began at 3 . 0 0 . This seems to be a ludicrous situation, and I would have thought it more sensible to have cancelled the Fresh ers'Te a and organised your staff into an all day snack bar. Maybe your reason for the decision was because College block had commissioned the Fresh ers'Te a and\" only the Union\" had asked for an all day snack bar.As well as this, I would suggest that it was probably easier from your point of view to\norganise the tea rather than an all day affair.\nOn top of this, we were told that the Union lower refectory would not open during the first week of term, but that\nit would definitely be open on Monday,8 th. Thus, when people complained to us last week about the overcrowding in the other college refectories, we pacified them with the assurance that this inconvenience was only for one week and would be removed by opening the Union lower refectory. This week it is impossible to persuade people any longer, and I would not like to repeat the many names w. th which you have been branded. \u2022 I have heard reports of the salad section in Southside running out of meals by12.45, i.e., giving people15 minutes choice, and then a\" take it or leave it\" menu. This situation can obviously NOT be tolerated, either from the point of view of the refectory, or from the point of view of the students of I.C.I appreciate that you are having difficulties with ref ec tory staff, but find it very hard to believe that ALL your staff from the Lower Union refectory resigned in the last\nweek of the summer vacation. Unless this was the case, I suspect the fault to be wholly yours, in not striving to\nsolve the staff problem before the beginning of term. Obviously, this problem is a difficult one to solve, but after the discussion at the Refectory committee last\nweek, I would strongly recommend that in the future you work to keep the Union lower refectory open over the summer vacation. This will both help the overcrowding in refectories due to conference bookings, and also save the Union staff from the inconvenience of being transferred to an alien environment over the summer period. Another solution which I feel must be considered is the o;,e of better wages for better staff. This is obviously a difficult one to assess, but has there been a survey done of wages paid to refectory staff in other colleges in the London area? I would appreciate a prompt reply in the form of a letter before our Council meeting on Monday,15 th Octo Iam certain that the refectories topic will come will be required to answer for you. Yours sincerely,\\ Norman Sayle s, President. ber, as up and Mr. Mooney's reply\nDear Norman, Iam very sorry that you have had cause to complain about the Refectory services, but I hope that when you take into account the problems with staff which we have had, you will understand. The Union Refectory staff last term consisted of: \u2014\nMr. Gomez( Chef), Joan( Cashier and charge hand), Kathleen, Nora and Dorothy, augmented by casual staff as and when required, and as far as we were aware all were returning for the first week of term or earlier. In the event what transpired was rather different. Joan, as you know, was taken ill last term, and after returning for the week prior to the first week of term, found the work too ex haus ting and resigned on Friday,8 th September. Mr. Gomez returned from Spain one week later than expected and announced that he had no intention of working in the Union. Kathleen telephoned to say that she had found a job at the same rate of pay, but with less hours. None of\nthese facts were known before Friday,28 th September. In\nfact, in the case of Mr. Gomez, on1 st October. Were therefore found it impossible to open the Union as promised, for the all day Snack Bar. The four ladies you saw were casual staff hired from the Employment exchange for that day to do the Fresh ers'Te as. The fact\" Leadership\nCrisis\nSir, Many of us who did not vote for the Union President last term, atleast hoped, despite his politically inactive stance, that he would attempt to be reasonably democratic and try to act in the interests of the students that\nhe represented. Last week's\" Purple Patch\" showed us that we were misguided. The central theme of the article was that we should\" work with\" and\" backup\" the College by paying higher refectory prices. The President believes that \" the college authorities are... on our side\" and we should not make them\" our ENEMIES\". Thus we should\" ACCEPT the increases\".( His capitalisation, not mine). I don't believe that anyone accepts that the price increases are justified, not even the\" moderates\" or the apathetic s, by whom, the President claims, he was elected. The price rises simply demonstrate that the College is NOT\" on our side\", and NOT working in students' interests. It is clear that the educational sector of the economy is having to pay for the Government's economic crisis. Children cannot have free milk; ILEA has\" part time\" schools, because it cannot pay teachers enough to live\nin London; the number of\nstudents in teacher training is to be cut by half in the next few years, despite the shortage of teachers. These are just a few manifestations of Mrs. Thatcher' s pinch penny policies. We know that the real\nvalue of the grant is decreasing constantly. Re fec tory prices are going up, and Hall rents will also rise next year. The cutback in expenditure by the DES is\ncausing much hardship to\nstudents, and denying many young people entry to higher education, particularly girls, who may have to choose between marriage and a degree education. Who implements higher prices and rents? College authorities. Can anyone claim that they are on our side? If they were really working in our interests they would confront the UGC, and point out that UGC grants are not large enough to run a university with reasonable prices and rents, given the low student grant. They would refuse to adhere to the UGC policy that Halls are refectories should finance that\nom mission ed the tea had no bearing on the the the vacation Our rate\nCollege ct\nmatter. We did offer the Union Refectory staff continuous employment in a different capacity throughout the long vacation, the offer was declined. Keeping the Union open during is uneconomical, as you well know, of pay is the, second highest in Universities in the U.K. Mr. Fisher of N. U.P. E. will confirm this, a London Medical College being the highest. It is intended that the Union Refectory reopen on Monday15 th, using office and casual staff, and while we will\nnot be able to provide a full service, I hope it will be sufficient to alleviate the queues and problems elsewhere. V.J. Mooney,\nRectory Manager. P.S. The Refectory committee would greatly appreciate help in the form of student Labour, with the running of the college refectories. Student employees will be paid simi lar wages to Refectory staff, and work either at lunchtimes or at evening functions. themselves. They would keep prices and rents down, and really support the Grants Campaign. Accepting increases simply opens the way for more increases. The President knows this as well as anyone, ye the is backing down at the merest hint of action. He claims that he supports the call for rent strike. Is it\nconsistent to accept price rises because the College authorities are our friends, then call for a rent strike? Students are looking to the Union for some leadership. We need some action in our interest, by the President and the Executive. None of\nus will accept a sellout \u2014 moderates included? Trevor Phillips, External Affairs Officer. COMMENT\nSir, The Editorial of Felix, October9, manages to refer\nto a large number of issues in a small amount of space and to say absolutely nothing of any sense on any of\nthem. What it in fact seems to be saying is on the one hand that the Tory Government can never be forced to accede to our demands for a grant increase; on the other hand if the present leadership of the Trade Unions and NUS is removed( and replaced perhaps with the writer of the referred to\nnonsense) then NUS will be able to get something out of\nthe Tory Government. Kathleen Corcoran. Editor's Reply The main question here is\nwhether anyone can get anything out of the Tory Government in the present\nperiod. The answer to that is\nNO. Nothing that is, except\nfurther attacks on one's standard of living and democratic rights.\nAccording to a survey by\na City Stockbrokers food\nprices rose on average 2 . 6 3\nper cent last week alone \u2014\nunlike workers' claims to the\nPay Board and students'\nclaims to the DES, most of\nthese price increases pass\nthrough the Tory Price Commission untouched.\nThis isn't just nasty Tories\nbeing mean to the workers,\nthe reason why this present\ngovernment is making these\nswing eing attacks is because\nthey are driven on by the\nrapidly deepening economic\ncrisis. In order to protect\ntheir profits, they have to\ndrive down the living standards of the working class,\ncut back on domestic expenditure, and of course to do\nthis they have to emasculate\nthe trades unions and organisations of the working class.\nHence the Industrial Relations Act, Phase I, Phase III\nand Gilbert Longden's anti-autonomy green paper.\nTo protect our rights and\nour living standards we\nmust remove these left-talkers in the NUS and the\ntrade unions and replace\nthem with a leadership who\nwill mobil is e students and\nworkers around a platform of\nremoving this government\nand replacing it with a Labour government pledged to\nsocialist policies, including\nimmediate cash supplementary grants to beat inflation.\nPARANOIC\nSir, Thankyou for introducing us all at I.C. to a new game, guessing how many times the word\" Stalinist\" will appear in the next issue of Felix. As one of the alleged\" Stalinist s\" at I.C,I would like to make a few comments on your editorial of October9. Nobody claims that the \u00a320\ngrant increase conceded by the Government was a great victory, but it was the first\ntime ever that such an increase has been given outs ide the Triennial Review, and shows that the Government can be moved. The extraordinary conference on grants held at I.C, set out a coherent workable plan of\ncampaign for the next year; raising the understanding and support of students for the aims of the campaign through propaganda and activity, the activity to reach peaks at times of the meetings of the Triennial Review when the Government is most vulnerable to pressure, and at the sametime the aid of\nthe organised working class will been listed by joint campaigning around the issue of\naccess to higher education, something which is denied working class children because of the inadequate grant. The sole speech at\nthat conference by a member of Y SSS( of which you area prominent member at\nI.C), consisted in the main in a paran oic assertion that\neverybody else in the hall was engaged in a witch hunt against Y SSS, a laughable assertion since we had rather more important matters to discuss, which I guess is why everybody laughed at\nher.\nNUSa few years ago clique ridden social and travel agency, leaders held back any activity by students and which was proved to\nbe indirectly financed by the CIA. Now NUS is a nationally important body capable of defending and advancing its members interests through mass activity. Some of the credit for that change must go to the so called\" politically bankrupt\" leadership of\nthe broad left, and the Communist Party in particular since we have worked consistently for that changeover the years. The was i club whose mass In the wider field of the Labour movement you accuse us of consciously working against the interests of the working class in order to retain our\" privileged\" positions. This is a lie and yet another example of Y SSS paranoia. One only has to read the\" MorningStar\" to see everyday the call for action by the Communist Party against the Tories and capitalism in general; but the CP. not only calls for action, its members lead struggles against Tory policies and capitalism, unlike the SLL( of which Y SSS is the student branch) which shouts from the sidelines about building an alternative leadership but never actually leads. Why is this? It is because the large majority of\nSLL members are not working class, their ideas are reg ard ed as ludicrous by workers, and therefore they are not trusted to lead. On the other hand, the majority of\nCP. members are workers, and other workers know by experience that CP. members are to be trusted to advance the interests of the working class as a whole, which is why there are thousands of CP. members up and down the country holding positions of responsibility( shop stewards, Trade Union leaders, etc). As for Chile, this is a very complex problem and can not be passed off with one fatuous line. In a country in which the working class is only30 percent of the population, and Allende rec eiv ed only36 percent of\nthe vote, openly arming the workers immediately as SLL calls for, would have meant a coup much earlier. The setback in Chile is not the end of the peaceful road to Socialism, just as the death of \" Che\" in Bolivia was not the end of guerrilla warfare. Paul Watkins( secretary, I.C. Communist Party branch). Living\nImage?\nSir, Norman Sayle s comments on the anomalous position of Post grads in the grant structure in Purple Patch, October9 th, and states that the grant is \u00a315 a week. The correct figure is, in fact, significantly less. This year the Research Councils have increased their grants to \u00a3695\nfor a52 week year \u2014 approximately \u00a313.40 a week.

It is rare that a man who is an expert in his field can also lucidly convey his knowledge in a simple but acc u rate manner. In this book von Hagen paints an evocative mental image of the Aztecs, Incas and the May as by his beautifully detailed accounts of their everyday life and the forces and drives which shaped these great civilisations whose origin stretch back to about2000 B.C. when the Greeks were active in Troy. Von Hagen has drawn on many years of study of their surviving Art and Arch it ec ture although much was systematically destroyed by Bishop Diego deLand a for religious reasons who also fortunately took notes. The staple diet of these peoples was maize upon which they were utterly dependent, a bad maize har vest meaning widespread famine. This one fact meant that\nall possible steps were taken to ensure a good harvest Von Hagen Paladin \u00a31.50\nthese being human sacrifice to their gods, a very good knowledge of the seasons to\nensure planting at the right times and agreed for more agricultural land. Thus their super broads for conquest of neigh bou ring tribes, and their temples, monuments to the hold their religion had upon them. Von Hagen shows that these civilisations had a high level of intellectual achievement although in some respects they had some rather interesting weaknesses or blind spots. For example the wheel was known and used for children's toys but never for transport which was nea rly all manual. Inca masonry involved using blocks of\nstone weighing hundreds of\npounds shaped to very fine\nlimits but the true arch was never discovered. All bridges or windows used one vast supporting block spanning the gap. Their astronomical knowledge was highly advanced to the extent that the May as had a congress in AD695 to correct their calendars. Communications by Paperback\nrunners every1^ miles achieving100 miles in a day with artists employed for graphic detail which could not be written was unequalled at the time. The factor which contrib u ted greatly to their defeat was a persistent legend that gods would return across the waters in a year of I heed( meaning I will return) these years, occurred every52 years in1363,1467,1519 etc. Christopher Columbus appeared in1502 and Cortes in 1 5 1 9 and who took full\nadvantage of the situation, and also the rather disorganised fighting tactics employed by his opponents who fought around a20 day cycle and who would stop all fighting to plant maize. This book is full of such fascinating insights and unsolved mysteries, all being well illustrated with about300 black and white pictures in 3 5 1 pages, a good index bibliography and chrono lig ical table completing the book as a reference source. Thoroughly recommended. Philip Webbeb\n\" GRENDEL\" by John Gardner\nPicador 40p The author of this unusual novel, we are informed by the inside cover, is a teacher of Old and Middle English at Southern Illinois University. So perhaps we should not be surprised that he\nshould take the epic poem of\nBeowulf as a very loose framework for this his third novel.( A cynic might note how fortunate some people are to be able to transmute workday drudge/ bewitch ment into pecuniary reward.) However, a very loose framework it is, the novel being told entirely from the mind and experiences of one of\nBeowulf' s victims \u2014 the mo nster C ire ndel. We enter the story at Grendel's eleventh year of his' war' against the Dane King Hrothgar, and, by a combination of chatty flashbacks and sequential advancement, C ire ndel expands his thoughts on the monster man world relationship. Thus we see the heathen world of these Dane men through the semi isolated eyes of our thinking monster. The mead sodden boasts and blind poem battles appear in relief\nagainst the thoughts of the' natural' narrator \u2014 \" Not, of course, that I fool myself with thoughts that I'm more noble. Pointless, ridiculous monster crouched in the shadows, stinking of dead men, murdered children, martyred cow s(Iam neither proud nor ashamed, understand. One mere dull victim leering at seasons that were never meant to be observed.)\" The novel, of course, only takes the Beowulf story to\nthe death of Grendel, but on this journey the author paints awry, humorous picture. We see the childhood innocent Grendel having a lesson on time and existence from a condescending and paternalistic dragon. And in the scene in which Grendel face sUn fer th, hero of Hrothgar' s tribe, we are left in no doubt at all that our monster is the antihero to end all antiheroes. So summa rising: black, sparkling in the twist and turns around Grendel's character, with a wit and cynicism that perhaps are too shallow to be lasting. Certainly worth consideration if\nyou have40 pence and a two hour train ride to spare.S. P.H.0 MM0 DAT10 N CRISi\n160 Bristol Freshers1\nsleeping\non floors\nThe University Accommodation Office has said that there is now sufficient emergency accommodation available to provide beds for those with no permanent lodging.160 first-year students have had to be given temporary beds in Hall, and the estimated number of students apart from these, who are improperly housed is\n2 0 0 .\nWHAT IS ' HOME? In a special University newsletter, it was stated that the supply of temporary accommodation had increased and \" no student need be homeless\". However, we must be quite certain tn at a home is something permanent which can provide the basic and necessary amenities of living which, for students, includes adequate bookshelves and a desk to\nwork at. The accommodation crisis is still with us and will remain with us so long as there are students slee ping on floors, I'i Ving in cupboards and greenhouses, as some are at present. From the present rate of supply for suitable homes, we can judge that the crisis will continue for at least the rest of the term. LONG TEi RM SOLUTION The Vice Chancellor has explained that the University Grants Committee, which finances Universities, is at\npresent considering its position on building Halts of Residence. Students must show quite clearly by stating their opinion in general meetings and demonstrations, that\ncrisis conditions are not conducive to satisfactory academic life. We must press the U.G.C. to build more accommodation and do so by providing at least75 percent of the cost, not25 percent as it does at present. Loan charges should not be tolerated by students and nor should we allow our academic life to be soured by these deplorable conditions of life and lower living standards than the majority of\nthe population enjoy. UNION COUNCIL STATEMENT At the first meeting oi the\nUnion Council on Monday,8 th October, the following resolution was passed unanimously:\" This Union Council rec-ogni ses that, ultimately, it is\nthe Government's responsibility to provide accommodation for all students and that the University should make representations to the U.G.C. to abolish loan financing of\nstudent residences. However, in the short term, we recognise that it is the responsibility of the University to offer suitable accommodation for living and studying for all students it gives places to. This Council demands a reduction in the charges being levied on students living in emergency accommodation in Halls. Union Council condemns the housing of students in the present unsuitable temporary accommodation. Un til the University is in a position to provide decent permanent accommodation for all students, we recognise that it has two alternatives:1. To house students in empty University Property2. To place students in suitable temporary accommodation, for example, hotels, and sub sid is e any cost, so that the payments hall be commensurate with the Board and Lod g ing element in the current student grant. In furtherance of this policy, we endorse the action of all student squatters in empty property, especially in property owned by the University. We will send a Union Council delegation, that is, three Sabbatical Officers plus Norman Peter ken, to put this policy to the University. If\nthe University does not act on this policy by the date of the next U. G.M.( Oct.11 that8 p.m.) then the U. G.M. should consider some form of direct action against the University.

He is an\nArgentinian scholar writer\nwho may yet receive a Nobel prize.\nThese short stories are the\nfruits born of lengthy study\nby the author Bather than an\nimaginative exercise. That is\nnot to say they are devoid\nof imagination, tout Borges\nuses his inventive power to\nweave his theme into a story.\nHis themes are often drawn\nfrom the philosophies and\nreligions of the world both\nancient and modern. The\nstory is manipulated as a vehicle to realise his idea.\nIn pursuit of this Borges\ndisregards description and\ncharacter development not\ncentral to his 'purpose. lit follows he does not feel bound\nto represent society as it is\nand his characters are not\nconstrained to reality.\nThe product of all this is\nnever more than ia dozen\npages. Borges' attitude therefore produces a concise mathematical style requiring careful reading to appreciate the\nalmost endless allusions.\nFor those familiar with\nBorge however will find this\nwork easier reading than his\nearlier publications as a result\nof a new approach to the\ntranslations which he has personally dissected.\nThe book leaves the reader\nwith sympathy and understanding for concepts from\nforeign cultures he previously\nfelt, from .logical necessity,\nalien to him.\nGreg Burland.\nGREEN GROW THE TRESSE SO by Stanley Hyland\nPublished by Penguin\nBooks, 30p This short novel by Stanley\nHyland has a well thought\nout plot which unfolds neatly,\nalmost too neatly.

Clues drop out from all\nover the place and soon all\nthe suspects are rounded up.\nThe presence of a nearby\nhigh security American base\nadds a hint of international\nespionage which livens the\nstory up a hit.

A beautiful, compact programme of traditional jigs, yet still retaining perfection, that ever popular, powerfully moving Jacobean melody was a joy to experience.

The festival did not\nreceive much coverage from\nthe press so I will start my report by explaining briefly the\nhistorical background of the\nFestival.\nIn 1 9 4 5 after the war, 4 3 7 representatives of 3 0 million young people\nfrom 6 3 countries met in London at\nthe inaugural congress of an international youth organisation, which was to be called World Federation\nof Democratic Youth ( W F DY). Friendship\nThe aim of this Organisation was to unite all democratic and progressive youth in the world in a common fight against war, fascism, imperialism and oppression. At the conference\nthe delegates pledged to \" eradicate all traces of fascism and create a deep and lasting friendship between\nall peoples on earth\" and to \" Keep a just and lasting peace and fight\nagainst poverty, exploitation and unemployment\". The delegates further\nagreed on a programme of action for\nthe W F DY and it started its work immediately afterwards. From the start\nthe W F DY took several initiatives,\nbut the most important was the organisation at the first festival in Prague\nin 1 9 4 7 . Since then the world festivals have been a recurring feature.\nUnity\nThe first festival, in which17,000 people from 7 2 countries took part,\nshowed the determination and unity\nof wide layers of young people to\nfight against all forms of fascism and to rebuild a peaceful world after\nthe destruction of the war. In spite of\ndifferent political convictions, religious beliefs and different systems of\nsociety several fruitful discussions and solidarity meetings were held. From these emerged the feeling of\nunity which was to characterise all successive festivals.\nSolidarity\nThe participants at the first festival also condemned the \" Truman Doctrine\" of the President of the USA who was responsible for drop-ping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since then ten World Festivals have been held and the main\nslogans of these have changed in\naccordance with the international\nsituation. Although the latter has\nchanged since that first festival, the\nneed to hold them is as great as ever.\nThe US imperialist aggression in\nVietnam has been defeated, but the\nvictory is not yet total, it Is still necessary to organise international solidarity for the right of the Vietnamese\npeople to self-determination, for the\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement and for the liberation of 2 0 0 , 0 0 0\npolitical prisoners held in Thieu's jails. In Africa, Portugal is massacring\nthe Africans with weapons supplied\nby NATO, liberation movements such\nas the PAIGC and F RE LIMO are\nactively involved in warfare against\nPortugal. In South Africa and Rhodesia the apartheid regimes are suppressing the majority of the population with the backing of big British\nand American companies.\nPeace\nAll this shows that the forces of\nimperialism are still very strong and it is therefore vital that all anti-imperialist forces should be united in\na wide offensive against these reactionary forces. It is in the creation\nof this unity that the festivals now can play an important role. The main\nslogan of the Tenth Festival was thus\n\" For anti-Imperialist solidarity, peace\nand friendship\". Christian\nThe British delegation for the Festival was organised by a committee\ndrawn from wide sections of the\nYouth and Student movements, ranging from the Young Liberals to the\nYoung Communist League, from the\nNUS to the Student Christian Move ment. The only conditions for participating was agreement on the main\nslogan of the festival.\nt Diplomatic\nOn the 27th August the delegation\ndeparted for Berlin. The trip was not\nuneventful. West German border\nPolice forced, with no apparent rea-son, some Iraqi students on the delegation to leave the train with their\nluggage. This was quickly stopped by\nthe ploy of making half the delegation leave the train and leaving the\nother half inside, meaning that the\nWest Germans could not move the\ntrain without splitting up the delegation and making themselves some\ndiplomatic trouble with the GDR. The action proved to be effective, and ten minutes later the Iraqis were released.\nCo-operation\nWe received a tremendous welcome in Berlin. The festival, with30,000 participants from 1 0 4 countries participating, was amazingly\nwell-organised. There was a special\ntopic for each day, such as\" Solidarity with the peoples of IndoChina\" or \" The Struggle for peace, international security and co-operation\",\naround which the day's programme\ncentred. Solidarity Meetings and Cultural programmes were organised on\nopen air stages in several parts of the town, and lectures, seminars, colloquia and other meetings, where participants could freely exchange views,\nwere held at the university, Apart\nfrom that there were separate prog ram mes for students, young work ers, cultural workers and sportsmen\nand women. To give an example,\nover 6 0 different events were organised for one day, not including the\ndiscos, pop festivals and other forms\nof free entertainment which went on, day and night. Delegations spent considerable time in discussions with other delegations, and these formed\nsome of the most relevant parts of the\nfestival.\nLow Taxes\nThe delegates alas had ample opportunity to see for themselves 'how\na socialist system works. The British\nPress (with a few exceptions) had brought out reports about the disastrous situation of the economy of the\nGDR, how the State had brainwashed\nits young people in special camps before the festival so that they would be able to mix with representatives of\nthe so-called free world. However,\nwe saw nothing of that. What we saw was a rich country with an active,\nopen-minded population, who seemed\nto take great interest in what was happening in.the world and who did not seem to suffer from any hardship\nor lack of freedom as the British\nestablishment defines it. Usually when people from the west go to socialist countries they report on how they could exchange money on the black market, and how people came up to them and asked if they could buy clothes, etc. But the shops were full, and no people seeme'd to be lack-ing. The average wage in the GDR is\nonly slightly higher than here, but this does not take account of the good social services, very low taxes and lower prices than here.\nViolent\nThere were no attempts by the\nGDR to prevent contact between\nyoung Germans and the foreign parti-FREE FROM MIDLAND BANK Vfour account\nIf you're a full-time student we\nmake you this offer.\nYour own bank account, which\nwe'll run for you. Free of charge.\n(Provided, of course, you stay in\ncredit).\nWhat's the catch?\nThere's no catch. It's just that\nas a full-time student, living on a' grant, you're going to need all the\nhelp you can get with organising\nyour finances. And we at the\nMidland are prepared to give that\nhelp.\nBut that's not alL\n2.Our booklet.\nThe second part of our\noffer is our free booklet - 'How a cheque book works'.\nCall at any Midland Branch.\nThe booklet and the account\nare there, both yours for the\nasking.\nMidland Bank\nA GREAT BRITISH BANK meets any financial need... anywhere\nBRITISH DELEGATION IN EAST BERLIN\nci pants; in fact, quite the contrary.\nA group of Christian Democrat students from West 'Berlin had come to\nthe festival with the aim of distributing anti-socialist leaflets and discus sing such matters with people in the\nstreet. This gave rise to some violent\ndiscussions, but there were no moves\nto stop them. Unfortunately the British delegation were handicapped\nsince the arguments went on in Germ an, and only very few spoke that\n'language. But many of us made contact with English-speaking Germans,\nmany of whom invited us to their\nhomes.\nFreedom\nThe purpose of the Festival was summed up in 'the main slogan. It\nmust have been an enormous encouragement for the representatives of the\nliberation movements in Africa and Indo-China who are involved in a war to gain their freedom to see young\npeople from all over the world actively expressing their solidarity with\nthem and show that they were not\nalone. It was certainly a great encouragement to us more fortunate people\nto see and meet people involved in\ngreater yet similar struggles to our\nown. It is now the duty of all the\norganisations who supported the festival to use the experiences gained\nfrom there to strengthen the anti-imperialist solidarity movement in\ntheir countries. The fact that many\ndifferent organisations participated\nmake it possible to broaden the\nbasis of that struggle and involve yet\nmore people. The work of the Tenth\nFestival is not over, for the 'discussion\nand cooperation must go on and ways of carrying out the main slogan\nmust be found.\nStalinist\nLast week an article under the\nheading \" Stalinist meaning of free\ndiscussion\" appeared in Felix, the\narticle dealt with what happened to\nP. Tatdhell, a GIF representative on the British delegation during the fes-ti val. It turned out to be an all out\nattack on the tenth festival. As a participant at the festival who actually\nthinks that there was freedom of\nspeech in Berlin and hence a\" Stalinist\", there area few points that I would like to raise.\nHarassment\nThe editor of i Felix Who I believe\nwrote the article forgot to mention\nthat the FDR is one of the countries\nWith the most progressive legislation on homosexuals as P. Tatchell\nin his report recognises. Homosexuals have full civil rights. All kinds of discrimination against homosexuals is forbidden according to the\nlaw and this is vigorously enforced.\nIt is true that equality before the law does not automatically mean that all deeply rooted prejudices against\nhomosexuals have disappeared. This\nmight explain the harassment that\nTatchell was subject to on two or\nthree occasions. But one cannot deny\nthat homosexuals in the GDR have a much better position than here. P. Tatchell also recognises this in his report when he says that on many\noccasions his leaflets were very well\nreceived and openly discussed by young Germans.\nCivil Rights\nThe article goes on to say what\nhappened to P. Tatchell and his placard which read \" Homosexual Liberation \u2014 Revolutionary Homosexuals Support Socialism\" and on the other\nside \" Gay Liberation Front, London.\nCivil Rights For Homosexuals\" in\nGerman. What happened was that a majority of the delegation did not\nwant this placard to be seen with the\nBritish contingent.\nDiversion\nThis does not mean that the majority were against Gay Rights, but rather that the majority thought that\nthe whole issue of homosexuals at an\nanti-imperialist festival was a diversion from the essential question. Perhaps this majority thought that homosexuals do not form a special group\nin society suppressed by imperialism,\nso that neither do gays automatically\nform a group which supports social-is m nor does the fight for Gay Rights\nbecome an anti-imperialist fight any more than the fight for a more open\nand free relationship between heterosexuals is. The text of the placard\nalso seems to recognise this. It reads\n\"Revolutionary Homosexuals Support\nSocialism\" and not only \" Homosexuals Support, etc.\" So if this is the\ncase why bring in the issue of homo-sexual s, as it can only act as a diver-sion.\nPunched\nA leaflet which P. Tatchell distributed read, \" Radical homosexuals\nare committed to a socialist revolution because it alone gives the potential to revolution is e interpersonal re-la tion ships; to liberate them from economic restraint, and exploitation by capitalism\". Here again we see the\nword radical in front of homosexuals.\nIam also sure that any rn arx is t would agree that this would apply to the\n\u2022relationship between heterosexuals,\nin fact I think it would apply to any\nkind of interpersonal relationship.\nThe article further quotes P. Tatchell. \" People were punched, kicked, clothes were ripped etc. and threats\nmade upon my life.\" What actually\nhappened was that P. Tatchell refused to abide by the decision of the\ndelegation and that a group of people\ntherefore went into action and ripped the placard to pieces. The violence he speaks about lasted about\n30 sees, and from where I stood\n(about 15 yards from P. Tatchell) it\ndidn't look as if anybody's safety, or\nfor that matter, life, was threatened.\nThe article also speaks about a rumour which went round before the\nvote took place. It is supposed to\nhave said that the placard read \" GDR persecutes homosexuals\". However,\nI did not hear that rumour.\nI cannot comment about what happened after this point as I had to take\nan earlier train to go to Switzerland..\nOpportunist\nI have spent so much space com \u2022 men ting on what may seem a relatively minor incident in the context\nof the festival for two reasons.\nOne is that some groups within the\nNUS are using these incidents to\nwage struggle against some members\nof the NUS executive who were present at the festival. These groups are\n\u2022not so much concerned about gay\nrights to which the executive is al ready firmly committed as about\nkicking some individuals out of the\nexecutive. These kinds of opportunistic tactics must be firmly resisted\nbecause they could do harm to the\nNUS as a whole, specially now when\nthe NUS is involved in the grants\ncampaign and the maximum degree of\nunity and involvement is essential.\nThe other reason is that the incident is also used by other groups to\nattack the festival as a whole, and thereby divert the attention away\nfrom the anti-imperialist aspect of the\nfestival. The article which appeared\nin Felix last week was such an exam-pie of that tactic. Articles attacking\nthe festival have, not surprising iy, come from the Express, the Daily\nTelegraph and other Fleet Street\npapers whose relations to Big Business are too well known. But I must\nadmit that I hadn't expected Felix to\njoin ranks with these papers. I know\nthat the editor likes to call himself a young socialist, but his consistent\nattack on the anti-imperialist movement makes me doubt what his true\ncolours are.

These fines were imposed in July when the\nAuthorities tightened\nup their ordinances\n(regulations) to allow a fine of \u00a31 per week for\nevery week that hall\nfees are not paid beginning three weeks after\nreceipt of the bill.\nAlthough a partial\namnesty was granted\nallowing the students\nup to five weeks to pay,\nat the beginning of this\nterm 300 students owed\nfines of between \u00a32-\u00a34.\nThere are now only\n60 left who have not\npaid the fines and the Authorities have threat-e ned to suspend any students who do not\npay by the end of this\nterm.\nThe students have\nbeen further enraged by further fining which took place over the summer recess following events at a sit-in in\nsupport of the grants\ncampaign which occurred before exams last term.\nThree people were fined \u00a35, five people \u00a37.50 and one \u00a325\nThe lower sums have\nbeen paid but the student owing the \u00a325 is\nappealing. The President of the Union Doug Knott said that he suspected a frame-up, as he too,\nhad ignored the warning from the Bursar,\nand done so with a corridor full of witnesses and yet nothing had happened. The student who was fined was convicted on the basis of evidence submitted by three\nmembers of the University Authorities, one of\nwhich was the Bursar. The amendment at\nlast Wednesday's U GM was passed overwhelmingly but the motion as a whole will not be voted on until today\n( Tuesday).

    "content": "October 16th,1973 FELIX Page 3\nPURPLE PITCH Once again it has got\nround to the time for me to\nwrite my article. It is now only four days since I wrote the last one, and since then very little has happened. I have been to several dinners and lunches for which Iam very grateful, and I have had lengthy discussions with the Refectory manager and chairman of the refectory committee with respect to\nthe opening of the Union Lower Refectory. In this week's FELIX you should be able to read both the letter\nwhich I sent to Mr. Mooney, and also the reply which I rec eiv ed. In Mr. Mooney' s letter, he explains, I think quite fully, the reasons for\nthe refectory not having opened, and has given usa. firm promise that it will be open on Monday,15 th October. He did, however, make the point quite clear that extra staff in the form of student labour would be re-qui red to keep the refectories running at full steam. These jobs in the refectories are\nnot the best jobs to undertake in your sparetime, but\nthey are at least reasonably paid, and you get reasonable meals( free). The person to get in touch with is Mrs. Hai thorn th wait on Int. 2 8 8 0\nif you fancy doing the job. Also this week we have had a very serious talk with Dave D ruc e about the setting up of a society for homosexual and also bisexual students in the college. The society will become known as GAY SOC and its aims will be to promote and discuss the Gay Lib aspect of life in the20 th century. Please take this society seriously as it\nis being set up for the good of the minority. The least we can do is to give them a chance. There will be a meeting of the Grants Action Commit tee on Monday,15 th October( i.e. yesterday) at which we will probably make decisions on Grants policy for the next term, these decisions will be made known at\nthe Union meeting today. On the topic of the Union meeting it is ESSENTIAL that everyone comes as there is\ncertain to be discussion on Refectory price reductions, etc. As I said last week, I feel that refectory boycotts or protests are going to have no effect. If anyone wants to\nread my views in either last\nweek, or the previous week's issues, west ii l have a few hundred copies in the Union office.\nThat' s all for now, see you on Tuesday lunchtime. P.A.W. N.O* Hard Sells\nIt has been brought to my' notice that a number of insurance salesmen have been going round the halls of\nresidence doing\" foot in the door\" selling. These insurance men are not allowed on\nthe premises unless they have been invited or have got an appointment with someone in the hall. I urge all of you to read the article headed\" Insurance\" in this edition. It isn't a plug for Ends iei gh Insurance, just an urgent plea to ask you to get expert advice about what you are buying. Don't sign anything before you' re certain what it is that you are signing. Cycle Thieves?\nThere have been a large number of thefts in the last few weeks.\" Ahh a\", you may say, \" but I lock mine up\". However, this may not be\ngood enough. It appears that these thieves have been cutting through the chains that lock the bikes up. This has tended to happen at times when there are few people about( weekends, evenings, etc.). For your own sake, please keep your cycles indie areas reserved for them. In this way it is possible to spot anyone who may be\ntampering with them. Touchstone Weekends\nThe college possesses an excellent field station at Sil wood, near Ascot. Twice a term discussion weekends are held at the station. At these, a guest speaker is invited to talk on a topic, the\ntalk taking place on the Satu r day. There then follows discussions on the chosen topic. Accommodation is provided for the weekend and the cost is only \u00a31.00. Coaches are\nprovided from Prince Consort Road at 14.15 on Satu r day, 2 7 th October and return at 18.00 on Sunday,28 th October. The guest speaker then will be Miss Kane, a founder member of \" Radical Alternatives to Prison\"( RAP) who worked in Wormwood Scrubs prison in1970. She will discuss the causes and nature of crime, i the reaction of\nsociety to antisocial behaviour, the role of the police, and the treatment of crime in other countries on both sides of theIr on Curtain. If you wish to apply, please send your name, without cash, to\nMr.C. K.M cDo wall, College Block331 before Monday,22 nd October. There is limited accommodation for wives and fiancee s. Commemoration Day Ball\nStill a few tickets left.\nPlease hurry if you want one.\nUnion Meeting\nPlease try and come to tod a y's union meeting. There is a lot of important business to be discussed and it is essential that the meeting is\na fair representation of the\nviews within the. Union. Insurance-Ted York\nWhen you are in college you soon find yourself very much in demand. Particularly with a lot of insurance salesmen anxious to sell you life\nassurance. Now there is\nnothing wrong with insurance as such. It is very important, sometimes essential, and pot-ent i ally extremely valuable. It is certainly something you as a student will have to\nconsider very carefully. Finding the right insurance for your own individual needs can be quite a complex business. You will need ex-pert, impartial advice from someone who understands student insurance. You will want a scheme that is right for you, value for money, and most of all, reliability. It was precisely because the National Union of Students recognised both the importance of insurance to\nthe student and the need for\na fair insurance deal that\nthey set up their own insurance brokerage. It is called Ends iei gh, and is the ONLY student owned insurance brokerage. Ends iei g his owned by students themselves but is operated by\nfully trained and experienced insurance men and women. Remember that with the massive strength of the 6 0 0 , 0 0 0\nmembers of NU S,Ends leigh has been able to negotiate some very favourable terms for motor insurance, property insurance, travel insurance, and many other s.Ends leigh do not act only as Life\nAssurance Brokers, but we are happy to advise you when the need a;ises. Please remember to consult End sleigh before making a decision on your life assurance. There is a permanent\nInsurance Centre at Imperial\nCollege in the \" Room at the\nTop\" open daily between the\nhours of 1 1 . 3 0 - 2 . 3 0 . Use it l GAYSOC\nOne of the most notable and lamentable facts about the social life of IC is its distinct lack of any kind of Gay soc, and it is my avowed intention to remedy this ma tter as soon as possible. There is, of course, the' London University Gay Students' Society' for those who have heard of it, and who are prepared to' habitually undertake the arduous return journey to Bloomsbury to attend its functions. However, it seems pretty clear, to me at any rate, that UL U societies have little relevance to the individual colleges, and our own society would seem a much more satis fac tory prospect. The aims of the society are hazy at present, but they would presumably follow the\ngeneral lines of the UL U society which organises discussion meetings, debates and lectures by speakers of note who hurl forth ideas on all aspects of the sexual spectrum, in addition to parties, discos, dances, etc., at Which gay students can meet others with common interests other than just sex. The first step is to get\nsome names on the membership list. I would like to hear from homosexuals and bisexuals of both sexes and, of\ncourse, heteros who are interested in the virtue of the\ncause of homosexual equality. So if you are gay. and cannot contact others of the same inclinations, don't goon living in miserable isolation. You can contact me through our revered Pre si dent and his minions or\nthrough the Chemistry letter-rack, and we'll talk them a tter over.

Fred sat by him\nand got talking. When\nhe made to go, the student thanked him say-ing, \"You are the first\nEnglishman to speak to\nme ever since I arrived.''\nI hope that this has not been your experience if you area new student at this college. I have to warn you however, that as college gains momentum and everyone buries himself in his books, life can become very impersonal. Not even the pages of Felix will carry comforting words for the overseas student. The aim of this article is\nto leave no overseas student with an excuse for keeping to himself and feeling lone ly, lost and miserable. We area group of people( students and staff) who genuinely believe that overseas students' life in college and in Britain can be very happy and enjoyable. We are going all the way to prove this. As Professor Rogers, of\ncry tal logro ph y, said at the international reception, T.C. enjoys a greater share of o/s students than any other college of London University. The facilities in college are geared to enable us to develop in mind and body, so that we can be of full use to our countries. The professor says that he does not accept any o/s students into\nhis department unless he is\nassured that they are going to use what they have learnt. The fact that IC is bursting with o/s students, is a challenge to our group as we seek ways and means of\nhelping the different races and nationalities to come tog ether and just have a nice time. It is not usually, easy if you already have taken part in some of our activities, we thankyou for coming along. On the other hand you may have received a programme of international activities and we hope you will come and take part. Some activities in the\npipeline:(1) A visit to Hampton Court Palace. This really is\na little introduction to what there is to be seen in Britain and the British way of life.\nAs such the palace visit is to\nbe followed by a visit to\nEnglish families who have kindly offered to entertain us at their evening meal: \u2014 Tea, English style. Only25 places are available. If you are interested please contact me soon( see below). There will be no charges except for\ntransport and entrance fee to\nthe Palace, approx. \u00a3 1 .\nThe trip is on Saturday,20 th October, leave I.C. Union Arch at12.30 p.m.(2) Trip to Greenwich to\nsee the Old Royal Observatory, etc., 3 rd November, leave Union Arch10 a.m. You may be suspicious of\nthe motives behind this gesture. It isn't usual for Felix to carry articles like this. The reason is just the same as that which motivated Fred Crittenden to initiate international students' activities throughout the British Isles. The reason is a five\nletter word, AGAPE. It is a five letter word first introduced by Jesus. It means love. Agape means that whatever may be the circumstances and events around us there is still a place in our mind for the welfare of\nothers. We do believe that\nthere is a lot we can learn from each other, as we share our culture s.I.C. is\nblessed with so many cultures, and such diversity of\nnationalities that only agape, the selfless concern for\nothers, can truly bring us tog ether. One thing that we are\nexperiencing in the \" Christian Union\" is the overflow of this agape \u2014 love amongst ourselves. We are not surprised that this is so, bec a use our leader and Lord Jesus, did not only introduce the word but promises that\nhe would send it as a gift to\nhis people. We do thank him for it. The nature of agape \u2014\nlove is such that it can be shared, and this is the reas on why without any other motives we are saying that\nanybody who wants to take part in our international students' activities is very welcome. There are many other activities taking place throughout this term for overseas students. If you would like information about them, please contact me, also if\nyou would like a programme of activities please get in\ntouch. DEREK B. MU TUNG U Dept. of Metallurgy. P.S. To any student reading this article: There may be an overseas student, just arr i ved, who would value the\ninformation given here, or\nwho does not know yet that\nFelix exists. So please pass your copy on. Sir, It has been suggested that I write to Felix concerning the \"rent strike\" motion at\nthe last U GM. Personally, though1 doubt I' malone in this: Iam confused over the present situation. The President in the last issue of Felix im-)lies that to with-hold next term's hall rents from the College will both help the College and be a useful lever on the govern-ment. C. E.F.B. speaks of the\nRector's support for a rent\nstrike. The decision( implied) to have a rent strike was taken at the first U GM of the year, with about 3 0 0\npeople present, where, I am\ntold, about half the members were- fresh msn, and with no publicity( of which I know) of the intended motion. There was little discussion, especially over the rent strike aspect, and no clear reasons seem apparent. Do all these fresher s know all the aspects of the argument without any discussion? Is it\nthat the discussion last year about it is considered sufficient? If so why isn't last\nyear VW< noi\"<<wi adequate also? If it's that the situation has changed, then why no\nfurther discussion? And why\nis the Union qi' it e unconcerned at passing motions which will mean its members are told or encouraged to brea'c their own word and also tho civil law?( All hall and house residents promise to pay the College each term's rent bills when received). It seems to ma that a number of points re quir o clarification and several should be fully discussed in the Union. ALAN SYRO P, "

Meanwhile, at Hayes, where the race actually was, IC composed no less than15 of the34 strong UL side taking on Blackheath harriers. It's difficult to find sufficient superlatives for this course... there were lots\nof gorse bushes, plough, hills, nettles and, of course, miles( apparently most of them uphill, and several of them between the changing rooms and the start). Blackheath be atUL by some1000 points to1500, and everybody from IC did very well... except Pad and Dave J who were last but one and last but two, professing that they didn't want to discourage the fresher s by doing too well. Pad, of course, was only there for the beer,\nthough he tried later to profound otherwise. And very convincing( if sad) it was too.)\nThe usual organised muddle of the CrossCountry Club has this year been thrown into complete disarray by the influx of scores of enthusiastic Fresher s. Last Wednesday the unexpected appearance of over twenty runners, atleast some of whom could be described as fit and raring togo, led to some quick re calculations considering that we were expecting a12 seater minibus and a party was dispatched via British Rail. Meanwhile those left waited for said Transport. And waited. It and Steve did finally arrive, and this second party, the light of enthusiasm noticeably dimmed in their eyes, set off half an hour late for LSE at New Maiden. Now, in all living memory IC have never missed a race( which can't be said for UL): we' ve held up the start a few times, but they' ve never started without us; in fact we' ve even turned up for races that didn't exist. This time, despite some hard praying by certain people, we also got there in time. The race, against four other teams, was won by St. Mary's College, With IC second due to our huge turnout( which also upset LS lE's plan for tea) and many splendid performances including one from Alf who even beat Cap' n Rob. Despite their vast numbers in the race, the Fresher s were noticeably absent at the evening festivities in the Union, missing a now rare opportunity to meet Hugh, though admittedly he somewhat disappointed his past fans. Those thinking of joining the Cross Co un try Club should not be put off by all this inefficiency: there Should be some fixture\nlists soon( apparently the BookShop have been too busy) and Pad says everything should be okay from now on. Tomorrow( Wednesday) we go for a slow jo ground our course in Richmond Park and Saturday is the occasion of the UC Relay at Parliament Hill with an amazing Will to sprint( or roll) down. Everybody welcome. Injuries\nsym pathis ed with. DJ. BOAT CLUB\nThe Boat Club this year has had a large in take of experienced oarsmen new to the club. This maybe due to last year's considerable successes, but even this year bodes great achievements. It is strange when all enemy strokes from the faster school crews are now apparently amongst our crews. We have formed a squad of24 senior oarsmen all trying for the first eight, and with such a variety of talent, selection will take sometime. The newcomers to the sport at I. C.B.C. are showing considerable promise and enthusiasm, but we welcome competition! If there are any people Who would like to try the sport please contact Dai Bevan Via the Chemistry P.G. letter rack. With the Head of the River for IV s only ten days away the squad has split up into four s. We had our first outing in trials on Wednesday,10 October and found we' ve turned up trumps With a couple of boats. By chance we have four very strong oarsmen who have much experience in racing, but they have only won in races shorter than the National qualifying course, thus they are still able to row at a low status. Now we have put these together in a Senior C Restricted IV, and as we came3 rd in this class last year with only a reasonably good crew, it is a main hope for the future. Our first cox less four in the Open event should do creditably, stroked by a new American Olympic Tria il stand Supported by three of the crew who broke virtually every IV' s regatta record at their races during the Summer Vacation. Morphy Day this year will be on Wednesday October24. This, as most of you know, Is the annual occasion where the three constituent colleges of I.C. put forward three sets of eights for the three races, Morphy, Lowry and Rugby. This event takes place outside the Boat house at Putney Embankment and although the racing maybe of prime importance to the competitors, everybody else seems more interested in bouncing up and down on Putney Bridge to find its resonant frequency, or tying up buses with the famous Rope. It's a traditional event Which everyone on the Embankment expects and noone resents it. Wear every Interested in novice training as this Is our prime means of perpetuating the \u00a9tub, so if you are down for Morphy Day or any Wednesday afternoon please ask for either the Vice Captain or Captain and they will gladly give you details. Events of the next week: Oct21 \u2014 Head of the River for IV s. Oct24 \u2014 Morphy Day. BRIDGE CLUB\nCalling all masochists l Do you enjoy being humiliated by partner's scorn and laughed at by onlookers as you misplay yet another hand? Then we're the people you should seel The bridge room is open every lunchtime for dedicated carvers( sorry, players!) to butcher contracts in congenial squalor. If you enjoy playing with greasy cards, sitting in arm less armchairs( most of the legs are still there), this is for you!! More seriously, the club tries to promote bridge in the college not only by these lunchtime sessions but also with a duplicate pairs session every Monday evening. This carries local points and cash prizes for successful pairs. Two Monday evenings later this term will be devoted to a pairs championship for which a mug will be awarded( we hope!). The standard of players varies quite widely from really quite good to abysmal \u2014 and if you are partner less we can nearly always pair you with someone of an appropriate standard. We also field five teams in the intercollegiate leagues run by U.L. U. This usually involves one or two matches a week, sometimes\" home\", sometimes\" away\". Last season was a successful one, but this year we are short of players. Anyone who can take a finesse has a good chance of playing for the college at sometime or other! These matches also carry local points for the winners, and are pleasant evenings, often starting and finishing in the bar! Anyone wanting to know more about the club should contact John Kilner, John Clements, David Gadd, or Malcolm Odd y,one of whom is invariably in the bridge room at lunchtime. EDITORIAL\nSo the best thing that ou related leadership( Sayle s8Co.) can offer about the refectory price increases is to accept them, thus going against Union policy. How right is Trevor Phillips( Letters page2) in saying that accepting these Increases simply opens the way for more Increases. The wholesale prices for food shot up over2 i percent last week and this rate of increase is itself increasing. That is why the Financial Times cal is this a pre We l mar period. if wes it back and accept these increases r tow in the manner of Norm Sayle s and the IC COm mun l st Party then what do we do next year when the121 percent increase already suggested is foisted onus. These inc erases are hitting us now and we have to understand why these are occurring before we have a hope in hell of being able to deal with them. In short the i mal n vehicle for international trade \u2014 paper money \u2014 has virtually collapsed; producing complete anarchy on the foreign exchange markets. Speculators have been unable to make money on the stock market and have moved en masse into the realm of Wholesale commodities, which has produced unheard of increases, most of which haven' th it shops yet. The collapse of paper money is due in essence to contradictions within the capita list system, and was signalled by the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement in1971 when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and left the world currencies literally hanging In midair. On a world scale the ruling classes are forced to drive down the living standards of the working class In an effort to inject value into their worthless paper money. In a period such as this, like I said last\nweek, togo cap in hand to the Tories, begging for money, is worse than useless for when theN US leadership do so, it gives credence to reformist politics which today are utterly bankrupt. As for Paul Watkins' statement( Letters page2) that the MorningStar( Stalinist daily paper) calls everyday for action against the Tories \u2014 that is a blatant lie. On the day of the \u00a3 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 fine that theN IRC imposed on the AUE W, the\" We Say\" editorial column of the Star proposed no action whatsoever \u2014 ' it read more like a news column of the Sun, rather than the daily organ of a working class organisation in the lead of the fight against the Tories. And Renato Ez ban( centre page spread) says that to criticise the utter bankruptcy of the Communist Party gives notice of allegiance to the rightwing. What drivel theY SSS in this and all colleges will take up the sharpest of fights with the Stalinist s, and the IMG and IS revisionists who cover up for them, who propose that we follow their peaceful road to socialism \u2014 which led the' German, Italian, Spanish, Greek and Chilean working classes along the bloody road to fascism. TheY SSS says no to these refectory price increases and that Sayle s&Co. should be pledged at once to mobil is e all students in a campaign against these increases now or resign, and further that such a campaign should also include the call for immediate and supplementary grants tied to the students 'cost of living, and cannot be divorced from the campaign to bring down this government and return a labour government pledged to socialist policies.
