    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n20.02.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nShould we boycott Fifty Shades of Grey?\nFifty Shades of Grey has opened\nthe door for us to talk about\nsex candidly and honestly\nin a way that has never been done\nbefore, something that can only\nbe a good thing. People are more\nopen to discussing their desires and\nfantasies than ever, with millions\nof people exploring new sensations,\nand rejuvenating their sex lives. But\nalong with this comes a dark side, and\nignoring that could be potentially\ndamaging.\nIt\u2019s fantastic that people are starting\nto experiment with their sexuality.\nCertainly among young people, the\nuse of restraints and role-play is\ncompletely normal. I\u2019ve played games\nof Never Have I Ever where people\nhave been given incredulous looks\nupon admitting that they\u2019ve never\nexperimented with being tied up.\nHowever, for our parents\u2019 generation,\nwho the books are aimed at, it\u2019s all\nvery risqu\u00e9, and something that\nthey\u2019ve probably never tried.\nSex dominates our society, from the\nmedia to advertising to clothing, and\nbeyond. It is so important to be open\nabout it; it makes no sense whatsoever\nfor something that is referred to\nso constantly to be taboo. I have\nalways said that if you\u2019re not mature\nenough to talk about sex, then you\u2019re\nnot mature enough to be having it.\nFor our generation, this is probably\na good measure, but for older\ngenerations this simply wasn\u2019t an\nacceptable option. In this way, Fifty\nShades really has caused a revolution\nin the sexual liberation of middle\naged (and older) women and men.\nUnfortunately Fifty Shades of Grey\nisn\u2019t just some pure erotica that\nhappens to have gone mainstream.\nIt is a story of a na\u00efve young woman,\nAnastasia Steele, and her relationship\nwith billionaire Christian Grey, who\nhappens to be really into BDSM.\nAna is timid, insecure and\ninexperienced. She is relatable to\nevery single woman who thinks that\nmaybe their life is a bit boring; she\nappeals to the weakest aspects of\nour personality. In the same way as\nTwilight, Fifty Shades of Grey is written\nin a way that makes you very easily\nput yourself into her role, and feel the\nhighs and lows with her. You form\nemotional attachments as she does,\nand so when reading it through in\nthe whirlwind of an addictive novel,\nyou don\u2019t notice that it\u2019s not a normal\npaperback romance.\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, there is no\nquestion as to whether or not Fifty\nShades of Grey depicts an abusive\nrelationship. It does. Between stalking\nher when he first meets her, isolating\nher, manipulating her, failing to\nconsider her emotional wellbeing,\ncoercing her, and threatening her\n(even outside of the contract she\nsigns, supposedly giving consent for\nhim to control her), I think it is clear\nthat it is not a shining example of a\nhealthy relationship.\nAs with any film or book featuring\nslightly gritty material, we tend to\nrestrict it to those mature enough\nto handle the content. With many\npeople calling for the boycott of the\nfranchise, and many saying that it\nshould not have been released as a\nmajor film production, the question\nis raised as to whether the authors, or\nproducers, have a responsibility for\ntheir content. Surely adults should\nbe allowed to recognise and decide\nfor themselves whether something\nis good or bad or safe or healthy?\nOther books, films, and even video\ngames are released that are harrowing\nfrom perspectives that we\u2019re more\naccustomed to (for instance featuring\nmurders), where the person viewing\nthe content is allowed to make the\njudgement that killing people is\nwrong. In this case there seems to be\na far greater backlash, and I wonder\nwhether that is justified.\nThe target audience members\nfor this book are uneducated about\nBDSM lifestyles, and are probably not\nfrequent readers of erotica (or if we\u2019re\ngoing to be honest, they wouldn\u2019t\nbe reading Fifty Shades of Grey for\nanything but a laugh). When they\nhave no experience of such practices,\ncontextualising it only within\nthe framing of being passionate,\nromantic, and sexy, are people really\ngoing to be able to see some of the\nabusive aspects of the story for what\nAnastasia Steele and Christian Grey: an example of how not to do BDSM. Photo: Sam Taylor-Johnson/Universal Pictures\nTessa Davey thinks that it\u2019s time to talk about domestic violence\nthey are? When you take something\nthat people haven\u2019t encountered\nbefore and tell them that it\u2019s hot,\nthey\u2019re more likely to accept that\nrather than question whether what\nthey\u2019re being told is actually even\nokay. While I absolutely think that\npeople should be given the benefit\nof the doubt in interpreting what\nthey read and watch, mislabeling an\nabusive relationship like as this as\na whirlwind romance is potentially\nharmful.\nThe point at which any activity, be\nit BDSM or as vanilla as you please,\nis consensual is at the point of a\nclear, informed, sober yes. Ana is of\na consenting age and is sober, and\nagrees to Christian Grey\u2019s contract.\nDoes this mean that she is giving\ninformed consent? Ana has never\nhad sex, or even masturbated. Her\nviews of sex and relationships are\nincredibly underdeveloped for\nsomeone her age, and she views them\nin a very na\u00efve way. She is, in my\nopinion, not emotionally mature\nenough to agree to this contract with\nno discussion. Ana is willing, she\u2019s\ninto it, but I think simply describing\nall of the sex as consensual because\nshe timidly nods agreement, or she\ntrembles in anticipation, or says it\nfeels good when he goes down on her,\nis simply insufficient.\nThe cast, directors, and producers\nof the film have stated that Fifty\nShades of Grey \u201cdoes not glorify\ndomestic abuse\u201d. This may be true\nof the film, which has been highly\nedited and cut to make it suitable\nfor cinematic viewing. The film may\nnot portray the very shaky ground\non which the consent stands, but\nChristian Grey is generally seen to\nbe abusive throughout. The director,\nSam Taylor-Johnson, says, \u201cand when\nhe crosses that line it\u2019s a very firm no\nand she has the final word - she has\nall the power and he\u2019s the vulnerable\none so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any\nglamorisation of it.\u201d This is in jarring\ncontrast to parts of the book, where\nthrough her narratives, Ana is seen to\nfeel out of her depth.\nThe film, while being either\nlaughably terrible, or exactly your\ncup of tea, is, as expected, not as\nproblematic as the books. As far as\nEL James is concerned, whether or\nnot the book is depicting abuse is\nnot a topic up for discussion, stating,\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me started. No it\u2019s notOK?\u201d This is dismissive, and displays\nan attitude that is grossly unhelpful\nin a society where talking about sex\nis still somewhat taboo, and domestic\nviolence is stigmatised.\nThese books started a positive\ndialogue about sex, reducing the\ntaboo, and have the potential to\nhelp start a conversation that could\nhelp break the stigma surrounding\ndomestic violence, an important\nsubject that should be open for free\ndiscussion.\n\n"

This\nis a topic I have become particularly\npissed off about, as I feel like history\nis literally repeating before my\neyes; its yet another example of\ncrappy communication, and College\ndisregarding student views.\nI was invited to the Weeks Hall\ncommittee meeting on Tuesday\nevening, and listened intently to\ntheir worries and concerns over the\nclosure. They explained how they\nhad heard that their hall was closing\npurely through someone coming\nacross the Felix twitter stream the day\nafter the Union Council meeting that\ntook place. Few of them even knew\nwhat Council was; all were unaware\nthat the closure of the hall was being\ndiscussed.\nA big topic discussed in IQL was\ncommunication, and I said that it\nseriously needed to be improved.\nThe communication between the\nsabbatical officers, the Union Council\nand students is incredibly poor: more\ninformation about Weeks hall should\nhave been in the paper announcing its\nclosure, and it should not have been\nembedded in a complex, heavy paper\ndiscussing a lot of other topics.\nStudents need to be informed what\nissues are up for discussion during\nthese meetings, and make sure those\nwho may want to contribute to the\ndebate know they\u2019re welcome. The\nUnion loves to boast about their\nwebsite and hits a day; maybe use\nthat to advertise papers ahead of\nHow else do you explain that\nthey present these \u201clowered\u201d rent\nprices for the halls in Acton, but are\ntelling us we have to bear the grunt\nof increased rent prices as a result\nfor other halls? I\u2019m pretty sure they\npromised us lower rents in the first\nplace without this catch, but, really,\nwhat do I know?\nI\u2019ll probably be gone next year, and\nno-one will even remember in five\nyears what it is like to be able to live\nnear campus with enough money left\nover to pay for entry into the Union.\nFinally, how else can you explain\nhow they talk all about change and\nimprovement, but they still are yet\nto review their piss poor consultation\npriorities when it comes to listening\nto students?\nYou can run all the surveys, reviews\nand online assessments you like, but\nyou can never understand the true\nviews of the students if you don\u2019t take\nthe time to actually speak to them\none to one.\nIt shocked me that no-one had\nsimply gone down to Weeks, sat down\nwith the students living there, and\nsimply asked them what they thought\nbefore I did this week. My job is to\nreport on the news, not do the job\nof those in College or those voted to\nactually represent students in the\nUnion.\nSo I got angry during IQT when\nDebra, one of the people behind\nthe decisions to close the hall, was\nthrowing these usual lines about\nconsultation and transparency. I got\nangry when all Tom could do was\napologise, but spin it that the College\nshould have done something when it\ncame to telling the residents, not him.\nBecause it was actually myself that\nlistened as they told me how much\nthey love their hall, how much value\nthe property can give to the student\nexperience, and how again and again\nCollege seem to just announce these\nplans without thinking first.\nAnd sadly, I can\u2019t do anything\nabout it, except make sure as many\npeople know as possible this time that\nCollege and the Union truly screwed\nup.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nIn last week\u2019s issue, we covered\nthe Animal Protection and\nEducation Society debate,\nentitled \u201cAnimal Testing: Vital\nor Necessary?\u201d In the article, we\nparaphrased a part of the talk\ndelivered by Maggie Dallman,\nthe head of Animal Welfare and\nEthical Review panel of Imperial\nCollege. We heard from those\nwho were in attendance what they\nthought she said, although failed\nto double check this was the case.\nIt has now come to light that\nthere is some doubt over what\nwas exactly said, so we apologise\nfor any upset caused, and have\nretracted the paragraph refering\nto her portion of the talk, until we\ndetermine exactly what she said\nat a later date.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\nEDITORIAL TEAM\nCOPY EDIT TEAM\nCORRECTIONS AND\nCLARIFICATIONS\nFelix, Offices\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge, Winship\nRoad, Cambridge.\nRegistered newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix\nFront page picture of Weeks Hall courtesy of\nJonathan Masters\n\n"

Labour and the\nConservatives are practically neck\nand neck with only 75 days to go and\nthe odds of a hung parliament have\nnever been shorter. Britain appears\nto be entering an era of six-party\npolitics, where the Labour-Tory share\nof the vote is at record lows. This\nelection is the first in recent history\nwhere the public will be heading to\nthe polling stations expecting a hung\nparliament.\nFor a long time Britain upheld\na three party system, composed of\nthe Conservatives and Labour, with\nthe Liberal Democrats traditionally\ncoming in third place in the popular\nvote.\nAt the time of writing, Her\nMajesty\u2019s Government holds a 34 seat\nmajority in the House of Commons,\nwith the power being shared between\nthe Conservative Party (303 seats)\nand the Liberal Democrats (56\nseats) in a coalition. The Labour\nparty (257 seats) currently serves as\nHer Majesty\u2019s Opposition with the\nremaining 34 seats (there are 650\nin total, with 533 in England, 59\nin Scotland, 40 in Wales, and 18 in\nNorthern Ireland) occupied by nine\nsmaller parties, three independents\nand the Speaker of the House, John\nBercow. However, in the last five\nyears the political landscape has\ndrastically altered with the rise of\nUKIP, The Green Party and the\nScottish National Party (SNP). These\nsmaller parties have split the vote on\nboth sides of the political spectrum,\nmaking Britain\u2019s political future look\neven less clear than it did in 2010.\nAfter May\u2019s election the\nConservatives and the Liberal\nDemocrats are both predicted to see\ntheir parliamentary representation\nshrink significantly, with an increase\nin the percentage of votes and\nnumber of MPs for Labour, UKIP,\nthe SNP and The Green Party. The\nLiberal Democrats are expected to\nretain majorities in around half of\ntheir parliamentary constituencies\nand lose their third place position in\nthe popular vote to UKIP. The upshot\nis that Labour and the Conservatives\nwill end up with a similar number of\nMPs, and the Lib Dems will suffer\nsevere losses.\nThe result of these shifts in the\npublic\u2019s voting intention is messy.\nA coalition even more complicated\nthan the status quo looks set to befall\nour democracy, with the potential\nrequirement of a three-party\n\u2018rainbow\u2019 coalition to form in order\nto reach a majority in the House of\nCommons. One possible scenario\nis that no majority coalition can\nbe negotiated, and one of the main\nparties will have to lead a minority\ngovernment. This governing party\nwould have to arrange a \u2018confidence\nand supply\u2019 policy with smaller\nparties who would support vital\nactions such as the budget, without\nholding any ministerial posts.\nLabour is expected to receive\na hammering up in Scotland, as\nthe SNP takes the majority of\nconstituencies north of the border.\nCurrent polling indicates that, if\nScottish voting intentions do not\nchange from now to the election,\nthe SNP will win more than 50\nconstituencies (out of 59), putting\nvirtually all of Labour\u2019s 40 Scottish\nMPs out of a job. This level of\nparliamentary representation for the\nSNP would nearly equal the current\nsize of the Liberal Democrats, and\nmay turn out to be the crucial factor\nthat denies Ed Miliband the keys to\nDowning Street in a Labour majority\ngovernment.\nOver the course of this parliament,\nThe Green Party has been picking\nup votes from the left and recently\npolled higher than the Lib Dems.\nThey are, however, unlikely to\ntranslate this increased support into\nmore than one MP at the election.\nJournalists, politicans and pollsters all agree that this election is going to be a nail-biter. Watch this space. Photo: Wiki Commons\nJoshua Renken describes the current political landscape with a view\nto this May\u2019s general election.\nIn the last few years, Nigel Farage\nand UKIP have been amongst the\nbiggest talking points in British\npolitics. UKIP are currently polling\nat several times what they achieved\nin the 2010 election and two Tory\ndefectors have provided the party\nwith its first representation in the\nHouse of Commons. UKIP enjoyed\nsuccess in the recent European\nParliament elections, winning the\nmost seats of any party, but are not\nexpected to gain any more than four\nor five MPs after May\u2019s election.\nNeither the Conservatives nor\nLabour stand a good chance of\nwinning the 326 seats required for a\nsingle-party majority government.\nLabour are predicted to represent the\nhighest number of constituencies but\nnot enough to command a majority in\nthe House of Commons, as did occur\nin 2010 with the Conservatives.\nRegardless of whether it is in\nan outright majority, a minority\ngovernment or a coalition, only two\nmen are realistically in the running\nto become prime minister: David\nCameron and Ed Miliband. If forced\nto choose between the two, the public\nfavour Mr. Cameron. But in spite of\nMiliband\u2019s individual unpopularity,\nLabour is ahead in most of the\npolls. Public opinion suggests that\nthe UK wants David Cameron as\nprime minister, but in a Labour\ngovernment. If the Conservatives\nmanage to stay in power after 2015,\nmany will think it was Ed\u2019s poor\npublic image that kept Cameron in\nDowning Street.\nIt could be that the eventual\nadministration is not the direct\nresult of public opinion. Instead,\nthe government is more likely to\nbe determined in post-election\npolitical negotiations. In other\nwords, the weeks immediately after\n7th\nMay could prove to be more\nimportant than the weeks running\nup to the election itself. If there is\na hung parliament, party political\ntalks would no doubt consume\nWestminster, and in all probability\nlast longer than the five days it took\nfor the existing coalition to form back\nin 2010.\nThis far out, the election is\nimpossible to call. There is a long\ntime to go and a lot could happen\nbetween now and 7th\nMay. Election\ncampaigns are often defined by\nwhat goes wrong and public opinion\ncould still shift dramatically. For\nmany of us this will be our first time\nparticipating in a general election,\nand it just so happens to be the\nmost complicated and interesting\nin almost a century. Whatever your\nopinion, don\u2019t forget to vote.\n\n"

But\nhere comes Cake, the latest Aniston\nfilm that is getting positive attention\nfor its lead actress, and for good\nreason (those Golden Globe and\nScreen Actors Guild nominations for\nAniston speak for themselves).\nWhilst not exactly a shocking\ntransition for the actress, it is nice to\nsee her shine in a genre we so rarely\nsee her in; a wonderful reminder that\nshe will not be remembered solely\nfor the Rachel role. Aniston is simply\noutstanding as Claire Bennett, an\nunpleasant, unhappy woman who is\nstruggling to deal with the various\nscars in her life. A violent accident\nis hinted at, given the obvious\nreminders on her body, whilst the\nCAKE\nDirector: Daniel Barnz\nScreenplay: Patrick Tobin\nCast: Jennifer Aniston, Adriana\nBarraza, Sam Worthington\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nchronic pain from the trauma she has\nto live with does not make life any\neasier. Addicted to painkillers and\nshutting everyone away from her life,\nClaire gets oddly fixated on the story\nof a young woman (Anna Kendrick)\nfrom her chronic pain support group,\nwho committed suicide; so much so\nthat she even goes to knock on the\nwidower\u2019s (Sam Worthington) door,\nand also finds the time to visit the\nactual site of the suicide.\nOf all the things the screenplay\ncould have done with this fascinating\ncharacter, the main plotline is\nwhat comes up short. It is a terrible\nwaste of an excellent, understated\nperformance, only to place it in an\noddly peculiar narrative that makes\nvery little sense and does next to\nnothing to explain anything. Claire\u2019s\nmind is all over the place and this\nparticular obsession seems to come\nout of nowhere and the script is never\ncommitted enough to follow up on\nthis main part of the story. The weak\nlink between her and the widower\nfails to establish chemistry, and the\nfilm only seems to be back on track\nwhen focusing on Claire\u2019s personal\njourney to become a better person.\nThe redemptive quality in the story\nmay sound like the ones we have\nseen thousands of times before and\nin essence there is not a huge lot that\nsets this one apart from the rest. But\nit is with Aniston\u2019s heart-breaking\nturn that the film truly finds its\nvoice. Claire is someone you are\nnot sure to feel sorry for. Although\noften the grumpy bitch to her loyal\nmaid Silvana (an equally impressive\nsupporting turn from Adriana\nBarraza), a disruptive influence at the\nsupport group, and someone quite\nhappily numbing her pain with the\nstash of hidden pills not interested\nin improving through therapy, there\nis an unbearable level of sadness and\nyes, pain, with what she has been\nthrough. This is perhaps Aniston\nlike you have never seen her before.\nAnd for that alone, it is more than\nworth the time to sit through Claire\u2019s\nfrustrating, but ultimately rewarding\njourney of coping with tragedy.\nPhoto: Daniel Burnz, Cinelou Releasing\nPhoto: Daniel Burnz, Cinelou Releasing\nPREDESTINATION\nDirector: Michael Spierig,\nPeter Spierig\nScreenplay: Michael Spierig,\nPeter Spierig\nCast: Ethan Hawke, Sarah\nSnook\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPrepare to do some serious\nthinking with this one\nbecause if not, this latest\ntime-travelling, gender-bending\nsci-fi thriller cannot be understood.\nEven with focus and concentration\nit is difficult to piece everything\ntogether to make one smooth,\nsingular narrative out of the complex\nlittle strands that mess with your\nmind. But there is enormous fun\nto be had in The Spierig Brothers\u2019\nPredestination, a smart, and often\ntouching mix of genres that carries\nwith it some very nice, shocking\ntwists.\nEthan Hawke is a time-travelling\nTemporal Agent who is on his final,\nimportant assignment to take down\na criminal who is set to plant a bomb\nthat will wipe out many innocents.\nHis character initially starts off as a\nbartender striking up a conversation\nwith a seemingly random woman who\nis feeling chatty about her life. Said\nwoman is played by Sarah Snook, a\nrelative newcomer whose role is more\nvast than you could possibly imagine\nthroughout the film. The scenes set\nin the bar where the two characters\nessentially just talk for a few minutes\nmay not seem like the most ideal\nset-up for what the film promises\nlater. But it is definitely worth\nHawke to the future\nPhoto: The Spierig Brothers, Sony Pictures Wolrdwide Acquisitions\nsticking around for, and listening\nto everything that they are saying.\nSubtle hints in the background, a\nuse of certain words and phrases\nmay give away some clues as to what\nPredestination is all about.\nTo give away any more than this\nwould be a crime against the film\u2019s\nstunning screenplay that throws in\nsurprises after surprises in the short\nrunning time. There is so much\npacked in here and it does tend to\nmove rather quickly, but with fully\ndeveloped characters this poses no\nproblem to the overall enjoyment of\nthe film.\nHawke and Snook are excellent\n(Snook especially is in an\nextraordinary breakout performance\nhere), and the unexpectedly\nemotional element that is added to\nthe already busy film only shows of\ntheir talent more. There are painful\nchoices to be made and sacrifices\nthat need carrying out for the greater\ngood, and not a single plot strand is\nwasted in this tightly organised plot.\nEvery single detail you see carries\nsomething of importance, and it all\nsomehow comes together to create a\nfluid narrative.\nIt is always risky for a film or a\ntelevision to play with time. There\nare issues with continuity that may\narise, things that do not quite add up,\nquestions about alternate timelines,\nand the list of problems goes on and\non. But Predestination tackles this\ntheme head-on, and does not look\nback as it zaps through different\nperiods to mess with your mind even\nmore.\nPerhaps not everything will make\ncomplete sense after the first viewing;\nwhich is why a repeat screening is\nrecommended, to fully get your head\naround just what the hell happened\nwith everyone in all the time shifting\nspots. The more complex this gets,\nthe more the film draws you in to its\nunique, engaging ride.\n\n"

Photo: Eduard Feicho\nFrom the 23rd\nto the 25th\nof\nJanuary, the Erasmus Society\nspread their wings and flew the\nImperial nest to visit Liverpool and\nManchester! After some good old\nFiveSixEight grub (and ale) following\nFriday lectures, the multilingual-chatter-filled five hour coach journey\nto Liverpool commenced.\nSome of the students hadn\u2019t met\npreviously and this was the perfect\nicebreaker. After a very quick\nturnaround at the Liverpool YHA,\nthat evening the society President,\nLauren Anders, a Liverpudlian\nherself, introduced the society\nmembers to the nightlife of this\nfantastic city. They headed to Fleet\nStreet, first to Krazyhouse, then to\nBaa Bar.\nStudents experienced the wonder\nthat is a night out that doesn\u2019t drain\nyour overdraft! Relative to London,\nthe prices were nearly as cut down as\nthe average mini-skirt (despite the\nvery chilly breeze!), and there was\nmuch more of a student feel to the\nplace. The Erasmus group definitely\nmade the most of it.\nBlessed with sunny skies not\ncommon in Northern climes,\nand armed with stomachs stuffed\nwith a full English breakfast, the\ngroup spent the next day exploring\nLiverpool. Following a walk along\nthe Albert docks, the students visited\nThe Royal Liver building (the \u2018i\u2019 as\nin \u2018alive\u2019, not as in \u2018Liverpool\u2019), one\nof the first buildings ever made\nfrom reinforced concrete. On its two\nclock towers sit the Liver birds, and\nlegend has it that, should they fly\naway, the city of Liverpool would\ncease to exist. During their Saturday\nstroll, the group also came across a\nSuperlambanana sculpture, a cross\nbetween a lamb and a banana, of\nwhich 125 were designed by the\nJapanese artist Taiso Chiezo to\ncelebrate Liverpool\u2019s status as the\nEuropean Capital City of Culture\nin 2008. Other pit stops for the day\nincluded (of course) the Cavern\nClub, St. George\u2019s Gardens, the\nEleanor Rigby statue, the Museum of\nLiverpool, the International Slavery\nMuseum and the Walker Art Gallery.\nThe group travelled to Manchester\nby train on Saturday evening then,\nafter checking in at their next\nYHA, hit Deansgate Locks for some\nwell-earned beverages. Almost all\nbars required an entrance fee, which\nrendered the bar crawl plan pretty\nexpensive. But luckily they had\nFabian on board, who managed to\nblag the group of 20 into a bar for\nfree. Even more impressively, all\ngroup members made it to the hostel\nbreakfast the next morning!\nAnd Sunday was reserved for\nculture vulture-ing. First stop was\nManchester Cathedral, where they\nwere given a tour by an expert retired\nliterature professor. He first showed\nthe students, in a style not unlike that\nof an academic tutorial, the Angel\nStone discovered in the wall of the\ncathedral\u2019s south porch, evidence\nfor the presence of an early Saxon\nchurch built in 700AD.

Selfishly, College set these\nfigures based on the very wrong\nassumption that accommodation at\nImperial is already affordable.\nAt this week\u2019s \u201cImperial Questions\nLive\u201d Debra Humphris repeatedly\nmentioned the issue of transparency\nregarding rent, however the data,\nwhich has been released sets the cost\nof Wardening as an \u201copportunity\ncost\u201d of \u00a3795,000 annually.\nIn my opinion, this cost simply\ndoes not exist, as Imperial do not pay\na single penny towards Wardening;\nall they lose is the potential \u201cprofit\u201d\nthat could be made from not giving\nthose rooms to students. Ignoring this\n\u201copportunity cost\u201d, Halls of Residence\nactually make a profit of \u00a3351,597\nannually, and what we really want is\nfor this so-called \u201ctransparency\u201d to\nactually reveal the truth, either about\nthe costs of halls or even any plans to\nclose them down in the first place.\nDue to licensing rules, from next\nyear onwards under 18\u2019s will not be\nallowed to live in Beit. This will leave\nthem with two options: pay \u00a3200 per\nweek to live on campus, or live in\nActon, which perhaps may not be the\nsafest place for an underage student\nto live.\nNot only that, some students need\nto live on or near campus for medical\nreasons; again they will be forced to\nlive in unmanageable amounts of\ndebt, or compromise their wellbeing\nand accessibility through financial\npressure to live in Acton.\nIt is College who should be held\naccountable for this failure in\nrecognising the needs and feelings\nof the students, and, quite honestly,\nImperial is going to lose out in the\nfuture as a result of declining student\nsatisfaction. Endowment is already\nlow, and quite honestly I do not know\na single student who would be willing\nto donate money to Imperial upon\ngraduation.\nI had a conversation with Debra\nHumphris after Imperial Questions\nLive and all the questions she was\nunable or unwilling to answer she\nreferenced to \u201cEstates\u201d. I don\u2019t know\nwho \u201cEstates\u201d are, but if they are\ndeciding the future of hundreds of\nundergraduates without telling the\nUnion and its students the reasons\nwhy, something is very wrong with\nhow this university is run.\nHere\u2019s what some\nstudents had to say\nonline:\n\u201cItisverysadthatcurrentresidentswerenotinformed\nbeforehandandthereforedidnothavethechanceto\nstatetheiropinion.\nBrowsingtheinternetrumorscanbeeasilyfound\nthatthegeneralstudentexperienceatImperialispoor\ncomparedtootheruniversitiesandthisisalsobecause\nofthehousingsituationinLondon.ClosingdownWeeks\nwithits66roomsisthereforeasignificantlossasnotonly\nitfurtherdecreasesthe(affordable)bedspacesinPrinces\nGardensbutalsowiththecommonroomlosingaspace\nwhichwasalsousedforjointhallevents....\nTheUnionasastudentorganizationshouldreally\nthinkaboutwhattheyareherefor-makingthestudent\nexperiencethebestitcanbeorsupportingamanagement\nstrategywhichclearlyputsmakingaprofitfirst.\u201d\n\u201cItoccurstomethathavingalower\u2018headline\u2019rateona\nsmallnumberofroomsinsomehallsisallverywell,\nbutgiventhattheoveralllevelofincome(i.e.themean\nrate)hadtoremainthesame,thismeansthatjustasmany\nstudentswillbepayingmorethancurrently...\nIt\u2019sallverywelltoarguethatthe\u2018rich\u2019studentswill\nsimplypickuptheslackbutthispointofviewfailsto\nrecognisethatstudentsdon\u2019tgettochoosewhichhallsthey\nendupin-theyonlygettomakeachoiceof5,andarenot\nguaranteedtogetanyofthese...\nThereforethiswouldseemtocreateevenmoreofa\n\u2018roulette\u2019situationforprospectivestudentsinthatthose\nwhoenduppayingmorewon\u2019tjustbethosewhochooseto\nbecausethey\u2018can\u2019,butalsothosewhoaresimplyunlucky...\u201d\n\u201cEvelynGardenclosing2015,GardenHallclosed2013,\nPembridgehavinginthebalanceandnowWeekson\nthedangerlist.Inefficientuseofspace...haveyouseenthe\nbusinessschool?!Profitfirst,studentexperiencelast.Do\nthepeoplemakingthesedecisionsnotrealisethatthey\ncan\u2019tbereversed?\nItsstrangethatEastsidepricescan\u2019tbechanged/lowered\neventhoughthehallhasbeeninoperationfor5+years-at\nthesametimetheprocessinActoncanbecutbeforeit\nopens-doesthissuggeststudentswerebeingrippedoff?\nAllotherrentsincreasing,somesubstantially...and\nsupportedbythebodyelectedtorepresentstudents.\u201d\n\u201cSotheyclosedGardenHalltwoyearsagoandthespace\nisbarelybeingused.ItisnowhometotheChaplaincy,\nwhichdoesnotrequireallthespacethatusedtohouse\nnearly100students.AndiftheproblemwithWeeksis\nthatitistoodifficulttorefurbishthenhowisitgoingtobe\nusedforotherfunctions?Ican\u2019thelpbutfeellikeasimilar\nthingwouldhappenwithWeeks;whatawasteofspace\nwhensomanystudentswouldbedesperatetolivesoclose\ntocampus.\nWiththesenewpricesforhallsestablished,andthe\nclosingdownofthecheaperhallsinrecentyears,firstyears\narebeingpricedoutofSouthKensington.Itseemsthiswill\njustcreateadividebetweenthosefromdifferenteconomic\nbackgrounds.Ifthecollegecarriesonthiswaythenitwill\ndefinitelydeterpeoplefromapplyingtoImperialifthey\nknowtheycannotaffordtoliveclosetocampus.\u201d\n\u201cAgainandagainandagainweseeevidenceofthe\ncorporatementalitythatmakesstudents(thepeople\nwhoshouldn\u2019thavetopaygoodmoneytofighttoothand\nnailforeverylittlething)feelliketheyarebeingboxedinto\nacornerwheretheCollegedon\u2019tcareaboutthem.Imperial\noperatesaveryeffectivepolicyofnotgivingatoss(onthe\npresumptionthateveryonewhocareswillbegonein3\nyearsandthenewbatchwon\u2019tknowthedifference).\nActon,Teddington,PrincesGardens,followedbythe\ndeathofProfGrimm.......\n#classicImperial\u201d\n\"... something\nis very wrong\nwith how this\nuniversity is\nrun\"\n\n"

The women\u2019s team,\nwho won the Championship two years\nago, were in action at Ethos against\nNewcastle: the first weapon up was\nfoil and although Imperial has been\nstruggling this season in foil the team\nmanaged to get a one hit lead after a\ntense match in which the score was\n45-44.\nThe second weapon up was \u00e9p\u00e9e\nand the Imperial women managed to\nextend their lead with a 45-37 victory,\nwhich meant that going into sabre,\nImperial only needed to reach 36\nhits in order to guarantee victory. In\nthe event, doing what they do best,\nImperial also won the sabre, thus\nsealing victory with a decisive 45-20\nscore line, giving an overall result of\n135-101 . They have thus set up a last\neight match against Edinburgh in\nScotland, which is where the men\u2019s 1st\nmatch took place.\nImperial men\u2019s 1st, Champions\nlast year, were away to St. Andrews\nin their first match of the\nChampionship and after losing one\nfencer, due to \u201ca delayed train\u201d,\narrived in the home of golf with\nabout an hour to spare before starting\nthe match. The first weapon up was\nfoil and after a hard fought contest\nSt. Andrews pulled ahead 45-38, a\nlead of seven.

CarolusDuran\u2019s method of teaching was\nat the time radical; an admirer of\nVel\u00e1zquez, he insisted that his pupils\ndraw and paint at the same time with\na loaded brush on unprepared canvas.\nHis emphasis was placed on capturing\nlight on the subjects, expressing the\nobject through fluid painting rather\nthan seeking to create a solid mass or\na precise tonal structure.\nSargent employs this technique\nwith mastery in one his best earlier\nportraits: a commanding likeness\nof Carolus-Duran, which bears the\ntouching inscription \u201cto my dear\nmaster... [from] his affectionate\npupil\u201d. Much of Carolus-Duran\u2019s\nstyle is evident in Sargent\u2019s work;\nboth men\u2019s portraits depict the\nsitter glancing out from the canvas\nfrom dark, sparsely painted of\nbackgrounds. They paint in the vein\nof Velaquez, the Spanish master by\nwhom Carolus-Duran was inspired.\nVelaquez\u2019s mid-17th\ncentury Portrait of\nJuan de Pareja in particular bears great\nresemblances to the style that Sargent\nfavoured for much of his career. One\nof his fellow students remarked in\n1847 \u201cMr Sargent is about 18 years\nold and one of the most talented\nfellows I have ever come across; his\ndrawings are like old masters, and his\ncolours are equally fine\u201d. And Rodin\ncommented that Sargent was \u201cthe\nVan Dyck of our times\u201d after seeing\nthe painting The Misses Hunter.\nSargent straddles the line between\nrealism and impressionism, never\nquite committing to either. However\nhis work is never simply reiterating\nthe old, and his paintings are\nprofoundly modern.\nHis double portrait of the Pailleron\nchildren is nothing like what children\nwere depicted as in the 19th\ncentury.\nThey stare out from the canvas,\nlit spookily, half in shadow, their\nexpressions sombre and knowing,\nand their complexions deathly\npale against the rich velvet of the\nbackground. This haunting portrayal\nwith its psychological intensity is\nthought to have inspired Henry\nJames\u2019 gothic horror story Turn of the\nScrew. Similarly, oversized lilies hang\nover the girls in Carnation, Lily, Lily,\nRose, bringing a hint of danger into\nthe serene picture of two young girls\nlighting lanterns in the twilight.\nSargent\u2019s paintings of Robert\nLouis Stevenson show him at his\nmost experimental; in Robert Louis\nStevenson and His Wife, his usual\nway of focusing on the sitter\u2019s face is\nabandoned for a staging that seems\nincidental, almost photographic. The\nwriter is shown looming, mantis-like,\nthin as rake, and walking towards\none end of the canvas; on the other\n\"His work\nis never\nsimply\nreiterating\nthe old,\nand his\npaintings\nare\nprofoundly\nmodern.\"\n\"Sargent\nmade\neverybody\nlook\nglamorous.\nTaller.\nThinner.\"\nRobert Louis Stevenson by John Singer Sargent, 1879. Photo: Taft Museum of Art\nend his wife folds herself into a chair,\nhiding her face with a shimmering\ngolden veil. The space between the\nfigures is charged with tension, and\nan open door takes centre frame\nimplying unknown secrets and\nlimitless possibilities.\nEven in his more conventional\npaintings, theatricality is ubiquitous.\nThe sitters become larger-than-life\nversions of their characters. Warhol\nmay have thought Sargent to be\nglamourizing his sitters, but he was\nsometimes far from flattering,\nremarking that he lost a friend every\ntime he painted a portrait of one. It\nis not to be forgotten either that he\npainted Portrait of Madame X, the\nnow notorious painting of Virginie\nGautreau in a plunging black dress\nwhich so scandalised French Society\nthat the sitter was from then on\nentrenched in gossip, and Sargent\nwas forced to leave Paris.\nThe National Portrait Gallery\nexhibition seeks to show Sargent at\nhis least conventional; these painting\nare after all, un-commissioned, and\nSargent presented many of them to\nhis friends as gifts. The collection\ndoes show him at his most fluid,\nbut also paints him as the perennial\nwatcher \u2013 forever on the outside\nlooking in. Nowhere is this more\nhighlighted than in his portraits\nof Monet. He depicts the great\nimpressionist painting en plein air\nand sur le motif, some of the only\nevidence we have that Monet did so.\nSargent admired Monet immensely,\ncollecting many of Monet\u2019s works\nand later switching to his style of\npainting out in the open. In these\npainting we see almost a desire to\nimitate Monet\u2019s characteristic use of\ncolour and brushstrokes; the grass\nis painted in the hues that Monet is\nknown for, and this marks Sargent\u2019s\ndesire to move into impressionism,\na transition which he never quite\nmastered despite his best efforts.\nMonet was said to be quite irritated\nby Sargent\u2019s frequent desire to learn\nfrom him, and he wrote to his wife\ncomplaining that Sargent \u201cis making\nan extraordinary inquiry about the\nuse of yellow and green and asking me\nif I am coming to London; he needs\nme to advise him on the pictures he is\nworking on\u201d.\nSargent was in many respects the\nend in the line of the old masters;\nin the vein of Velaquez and Ingres,\nhe was one of the last great society\npainters. His paintings did not test\nthe boundaries of art as many his\ncontemporaries did, but his work is\nno less for it; by sticking staunchly to\nrealism whilst modernism directed\nhis contemporaries, Sargent created a\ndialogue between classic and modern,\nbringing together in his work Van\nDyck, Velazquez, Monet, and Degas\nusing visual quotations, thereby\nreinventing realism for the 20th\ncentury.\nHis painting show a great\nhumanism and empathy for his\nsubjects, and it is his affection for\nthem that shines through to confer to\nthem an ageless glamour. Whatever\nhis shortcomings, this exhibition\nshows Sargent at his best.\nSargent: Portraits of Artists and Friends\nis runnning at the National Portrait\nGallery until 25th\nMay.

The pilot study will\nfocus on the potential of psilocybin\nto help patients with depression\nwho have failed to respond to\nconventional treatments.\nProfessor David Nutt and Dr Robin\nCarhart-Harris of the Centre for\nNeuropsychopharmacology have\npreviously carried out research using\nMRI scans to study the brain activity\nof 15 healthy volunteers who had\nbeen administered psilocybin.The\nnew research builds on recent studies\nin the US, which have suggested that\npeople suffering from depression\nand anxiety respond positively to\ncontrolled encounters with the\nhallucinogen.\nThe Imperial College scientists were\nawarded a Medical Research Council\ngrant in 2013 to study the effects of\npsilocybin on patients suffering with\ndepression. Due to begin in April,\nthe experiment will involve studying\nthe changes in the brains of twelve\npatients with depression before and\nafter receiving a dose of psilocybin.\nThe scientists then plan to extend\nthe study to a full clinical trial of 60\npatients, 30 of whom will only receive\na placebo.\nResearch into the potential health\nbenefits of hallucinogenic drugs\nhas seen a recent revival after more\nthan 40 years of stagnation. Despite\nCECILY JOHNSON\nNEWS REPORTER\n\"The first\nhuman\ntrials in\nnearly half\na century\ninto the\nmedical\nbenefits of\npsilocybin.\"\nJust what is Union Council?\n\u201cBluntly I think it\u2019s something of a\nspineless betrayal of our studentsit\u2019s a perfect example of our union\nacting as a mouthpiece for college\nmanagement rather than a voice\nfor our members.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s also interesting\nthat council isn\u2019t questioning\nthe amount college invests in\naccommodation or its overall\nrental profit,merely discussing\nthe distribution of rents between\nhalls.\u201d\n\u201cI voted for accepting the closure\nof Weeks Hall,not because I hate\nWeeks Hall, but because I felt the\nreasoning presented at council was\nthe strongest for that option.\nHowever,I cannot say I made\na very informed decision and\nrecalling the discussion now I felt\nthat most of what was said were\nthings like\u201c...assuming Weeks gets\nclosed,what can we do with the\nspace\u201d.\n\u201cAt the time I think I found the\nbenefits of using all that potential\narea for more suitable causes\nappealing,without really settling\nthe debate about the importance of\nWeeks Halls in the accommodation\nportfolio.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad this is now brought up\nproperly and I see no reason to why\nwe shouldn\u2019t listen to what Weeks\nresidents and other students have\nto say,so a visit from them at the\nnext Council feels suitable.\n\u201cIf not,I think it is my duty as an\nordinary member of council to hear\nthese people out between now and\nthe next meeting in order to make\nmyself more informed.\n\u201cI think that I am not the only\ncouncil representative that would\ngladlyhaveachataboutWeekswith\nthe people affected,so I strongly\nencourage everyone behind the\npetition that\u2019s circulating to contact\nsomeone on council and make their\nvoices heard.\n\u201cThat being said,I\u2019m not saying\nI would change my vote today,but\ngood arguments for me doing so\nmight change my mind.\u201d\n\u201cI voted to close Weeks because\nit seemed the pragmatic thing to\ndo given that there is basically no\nchance of College changing their\nmind.\n\u201cHowever,I do now regret voting\nso as I feel we neglected to consult\nwith the members of Weeks Hall\nand consequently we have let down\nall of our members.\n\u201cI bitterly regret this and feel we\nhave an obligation to consult better\nthan we did.\n\u201cIn many ways,the fact that a\ncampaign is never going to be\nsuccessful isn\u2019t a good reason not\nto try.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so absolutely embarrassing,\nclearly the author of the paper\ncompletely screwed up and so\ndid we as council members by not\nlooking into it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s made even more of a mockery\nof Union Council,now people\nthink rather than not representing\nstudents the Council is actually\ngoing against what students want.\u201d\n\u201cI voted against in the first vote and\nabstained from the second.I think\nthe fact is that I can understand\ntheir argument...it\u2019s a lot of real\nestate for 67 beds.\nMy main trepidation is that\ncollege don\u2019t have a good track\nhistory of making good on their\npromises.\n\u201cHaving a bigger nursery for\ninstance,using some of that space\nfor club storage etc could all be\ngood.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know whether what\nwill actually happen to it is some\nsort of campus services outlet or\nsomething equally as unnecessary.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the information presented\nat the meeting,there was a strong\nargument to close Weeks.\nThe space could be put to better\nuse to support a greater number of\nstaff and students than it currently\ndoes.\n\u201cI believe Council assumed that\nthe Wardens had already been\nconsulted,and that putting effort\ninto lobbying to save other halls\nwas more beneficial for more\nstudents.\n\u201cIf there is extra information\nthat should have been brought to\nCouncil,this should definitely be\nconsidered at the next meeting,\nand if in retrospect the view of the\nstudents is very different,Council\nwould have a mandate to change\nits position.\u201d\n\u201cI abstained from voting,but\nbroadly agree with the decision.\nIf only 70 students per year can\nbenefit from Weeks\u2019price and\nlocation,that\u2019s not fair on others.\n\u201cAlso,Council didn\u2019t really have\na choice\u2013all of the important\ndecisions had already been made\nby College.\n\u201cWe felt it was better for us to\nlobby College to not close down\nany other halls,to use the Weeks\nspace in ways most beneficial\nto the student body,and,in\nthe future,to include us in the\ndecision-making process earlier.\u201d\nUnion Council is the second\nhighest decision-making body\nat the Union.Council is the main\nway that students can directly\ninfluence what happens on a day\nto day basis,as it contains the\nhighest proportion of directly\nelected student representatives.\nAny member of the Union can\nattend a Council meeting,speak\nand,with another person to\nsecond them,submit a paper to\nbe discussed.There are,though,a\nnumber of people who are expected\nto attend every Council,as they are\nthe ones who can actually vote.\nThere are two ways that these\npeople are chosen to attend Council.\n16 members are directly elected\nfrom the student body in October\nto represent undergraduate and\npostgraduate students from the\nvarious faculties (e.g.Science,\nEngineering and Medicine).\nIn addition,certain Union\nvolunteers have a vote and are\nrequired to attend.These council\nmembers are called ex oficio\nmembers,and include Academic\nAffairs Officers and the Chairs of\neach Management Group.\nThey are mandated to represent the\nviews of the academic rep network\nand clubs and societies respectively.\nThe Union President and the four\nDeputy Presidents attend each\nmeeting too,and also sit on the\nTrustee Board.\nCouncil papers often serve to\nclarify the Union\u2019s official stance\non decisions taken by clubs &\nsocieties,the College and even\nthe Government.They also\nact as a forum to manage the\naccountability of Union officers.\nWhat do members think about the Weeks decision?\na wealth of scientific work during\nthe 1960s investigating the effects of\npsychedelic drugs, research had to\nbe abandoned when LSD was banned\nin the UK in 1966.Still a Schedule 1\nClass A drug, academics in the UK\nrequire a \u00a33,000 Home Office license\n\u2013 and approval from NHS research\nethics committees \u2013 in order to study\npsilocybin.\n\u201cThe current legislation is stopping\nthe benefits of these drugs being\nexplored and for the last 40 years\nwe have missed really interesting\nopportunities to help patients\u201d, said\nProfessor David Nutt, director of\nthe Neuropsychopharmacology Unit\nin the Division of Brain Sciences.\nHowever the years of waiting and\nstruggling against red tape may prove\nto be worthwhile, if the research\ncontinues to give positive results.\nImperial College scientists to study potential\nbenefits of psilocybin in patients with depression\n\"We have\nmissed really\ninteresting\nopportunities\nto help\npatients.\"\nIn the last few years studies have\nsuggested that hallucinogenic drugs\ncould not only treat patients with\ndepression but also ease the anxiety\nexperienced by terminally ill cancer\npatients, helping them come to\nterms with death, and even aid those\nwith substance abuse problems in\nrecovering from their addictions.\n\n"

Do you have a few\nmoments to volunteer\nfor a good cause?\u201c \u201cAh\nsorry I\u2019m in a hurry\u201d This dialogue\nhas occurred in the JCR for too\nlong. And as students, who are\nstereotypically drunk 24/7, it is time\nfor us to stand up and change public\nperceptions.\nThe National Student Volunteering\nWeek (SVW) is taking place next\nweek. Imperial will be one of many\nuniversities over the UK to celebrate\nthe positive impact made by student\nvolunteers in their communities,\nraise awareness of the value of student\nvolunteering and inspire more\nstudents to get involved. A group of\nImperial Hub SVW Champions and\nI have been working together since\nNovember to deliver a fun-packed\nprogramme for you all next week!\nWe all know why we should\nvolunteer. It provides a great warm\nfeeling to be able to give something\nback to the community and make\na difference to people who are less\nfortunate than us. According to recent\nfigures volunteering contributes\n\u00a34.8 billion to UK GNP, and many\ncharities just could not carry out the\ninitiatives they have without the help\nof volunteers. Volunteering not only\ncontributes a social impact to the\ncommunity, but also economically to\nthe country.\nBut what most people forget is that\nvolunteering is a two-way process.\nYes, a lot of it is about you giving your\ntime and effort, but throughout the\njourney you will earn invaluable skills\nand meet amazing people, as well as\nhaving some some fun away from\nlabs and destressing!\nVolunteering increases your\nexposure to the world, since\ndifferent opportunities uncover\ndifferent social issues. Being around\none of the wealthiest boroughs in\nLondon, it might be easy to assume\nthat everything is fine. We see big\nexpensive cars on the road, school\nchildren wearing their hats on\nscooters and, of course, the many\nshoppers coming out of Harrods with\nexpensive handbags and cutlery.\nThe truth of the matter is, the\nlife expectancy at St. Charles is\nnine years lower than that of the\nQueens Gate area, though it is only a\nshort 30 minute bus trip away. Life\nexpectancy says a lot when it comes\nto the living standards and welfare of\nresidents and this just uncovers the\ndeep social issues on our doorstep.\nThe more knowledge we have on the\nsurroundings, the more informed\ndecisions we can make in life.\nPersonally, since volunteering with\nImperial Hub, I have changed quite\na few of my habits and make more\nethical choices day to day.\nIf you are ready to move on to\na higher level, being a volunteer\nmanager is even more rewarding.\nWhether you are coordinating a\nregular community project or being\na club officer in your clubs and\nsocieties, the experience provides you\nwith many transferrable skills, from\neffective communication, to problem\nsolving, to planning and organising\nevents. Being Imperialites, we can\nreceive training through the Union\u2019s\nImperial Plus scheme, as well as the\nweekly Lunch and Learn sessions by\nImperial Hub.\nThese programmes not only\nrecognise the time and effort you\nhave put into volunteering, but also\nthe different skills you have gained,\nwith both schemes offering the\nopportunity to gain qualifications.\nNot to mention the privilege to\nbe nominated for Community\nConnections Volunteer of the Year at\nthe annual Union Awards!\nMany of you who have started\nlooking for jobs would have\nencountered competency questions.\nWhat could be a better answer than\nyour volunteering experience to\nshow that you are a rounded young\nprofessional? In fact, a survey has\nshown that amongst 200 of the\nUK\u2019s leading businesses, 73% of the\nemployers would hire someone with\nvolunteer experience over someone\nwithout, and 94% of employees who\nvolunteered to learn new skills had\nbenefited either by getting their first\njob, improving their salary, or being\npromoted; a reminder that your time\nspent volunteering now may be paid\nback in the future.\nAll sounds good and ready to give it\na go? Well you\u2019re not alone! Currently\nalmost 400 students take part in over\n35 different opportunities, many of\nwhom are regular volunteers \u2013 for\nexample, Schools Plus tutors last year\ncollectively spent 1340 hours tutoring\nkids from a poorer background,\ninspiring the next generation of\nscientists and engineers. Have a look\nat what some of the volunteers have\nsaid and why they enjoy it so much!\nLast year, 100% of SVW volunteers\nagreed that participating in SVW\nhad been a positive experience for\nthem, so it\u2019s now time for you to get\ninvolved!\nHelping to clean up Brompton cemetery.

But Saul wasn\u2019t always\nlike that.\nIn Breaking Bad, Saul Goodman\nbecomes Walter and Jesse\u2019s legal\ncounsel as their meth cooking\noperation grows. Jesse convinces Walt\nto meet with Saul by explaining that\nin this business \u201cyou don\u2019t want a\ncriminal lawyer... you want a criminal\nlawyer\u201d. It becomes clear that no\njob is too small, or too depraved, for\nGoodman, who provides invaluable\nassistance to the pair from series two\nonwards.\nWhether it\u2019s laundering drug\nmoney, disposing of incriminating\nevidence or cleaning up crime scenes,\nSaul can solve all their problems, for\na fee. When asked how he gets these\nthings done, he simply answers, \u201cLet\u2019s\njust say I know a guy\u2026 who knows a\nguy\u2026 who knows another guy.\u201d Walt\nand Jesse soon become his major\nclients as the drug money rolls in\nand their situation becomes more\ncomplicated.\nSaul Goodman provided light\nrelief and gallows humour in the\ndark storyline that is Walter White\u2019s\ntransformation. Walt goes from being\na chemistry teacher with a cancer\ndiagnosis to the feared crystal meth\ncook and millionaire drug kingpin\n\u2018Heisenberg\u2019. When the streak of\nluck inevitably ends, every character\nsuffers. Goodman\u2019s last line in\nBreaking Bad was \u201cIt\u2019s all over.\u201d Not\nso. Now Saul Goodman, real name\nJimmy McGill, has a television\nseries of his own. Set in 2002, Better\nCall Saul is a spin-off prequel series\nwritten by Breaking Bad creators\nVince Gilligan and Peter Gould, that\nfollows the small-time Albuquerque\nlawyer seven years before he becomes\nWalt and Jesse\u2019s attorney.\nJimmy McGill\u2019s situation at\nthe start of the series is every bit\nas dark and depressing as Walter\nWhite\u2019s. Both series are essentially\nabout intelligent, solitary men\nwho feel financially pressured into\nbreaking the law. Better Call Saul will\ninexorably feature a pivotal moment\nwhen Jimmy\u2019s idealism completely\ncrashes, and he becomes Saul\nGoodman. This is going to be a darkly\ncomic, bitter sweet show.\nThe series cuts between Saul\u2019s life\nbefore and after meeting Walt, and\nhas already featured a few of the most\nmemorable characters from Breaking\nBad. The audience is already aware of\nwhat happens after Saul first meets\nwith Walt, but what happened in the\ntime leading up to establishing his\nstrip-mall law office in Albuquerque,\nNew Mexico? It is this question that\nBreaking Bad fans want an answer to,\nand Better Call Saul will give them\ntheir answer.\nIt\u2019s too early to know whether this\nseries is going to become as popular as\nits parent drama, but three episodes\nin and the show is shaping up nicely.\nBy tapping into the huge pre-existing\nfan base, the opening episode of Better\nCall Saul broke the record for the\nhighest overall viewership of a series\npremiere in US cable history. The\nfirst season consists of ten episodes\nand the series has already been\nrenewed for a second season of 13\nepisodes.\nThis series will be judged on the\nquality of the central performance,\nand Bob Odenkirk knows this.\nLuckily, he has had several years\nto master the \u2018slick-talking sleazey\nlawyer\u2019 role and Odenkirk plays\nit to perfection. Better Call Saul is\njudiciously humanising the slightly\ntwo-dimensional character that\nviewers enjoyed so much in its parent\ndrama, in a way that feels familiar to\nany fan of Vince Gilligan\u2019s previous\nwork. The series is confidently shot\nand moves at the pace of a sloth on\nvalium, but somehow the lingering\nscenes only serve to intensify the\nemotions of the characters and\nadd gravitas to a given situation.\nCrucially, Better Call Saul never\nfeels too slow (Perhaps it would if\none hadn\u2019t already been exposed to\ndozens of hours of Breaking Bad). The\ntwo shows are stylistically identical to\neach other. Saul\u2019s story is a complex\none and those involved in making the\nseries understand that they should\ntake their sweet time in telling it.\nBetter Call Saul is another dark\ncharacter study that painstakingly\ndetails the metamorphosis of its\nprotagonist from a struggling citizen\nto a professional criminal. If anyone\ncan do it, and do it right, it\u2019s Vince\nGilligan.\nBetter Call Saul premiered on\nFebruary 8th\nand episodes are\nuploaded on Netflix UK every\nWednesday.\nPhoto: Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, AMC\nPhoto: Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, AMC Photo: Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, AMC\n\"Odenkirk\nplays it to\nperfection.\"\n\n"

Said one member:\n\u201cIf you vote for someone to represent\nyou, you want them to do a good job\nof it.\u201d\nWhen Felix asked the Union why\nthey ran a paper to campaign against\na decision that they could not change,\na spokesperson responded: \u201cIn recent\nweeks it became apparent that the\ndecision to close Weeks Hall had\nbeen made with no possibility for a\nreversal of this decision.\n\u201cUnion Council had the option\nof whether to campaign or not on\nthis decision, we reject the notion\nthat campaigning against the\nclosure would have been \u201cpointless\u201d.\nCampaigning is not always about\ndelivering change, but sparking\ndebate, discussion and raising\nawareness of an issue.\u201d Photo: Imperial College\n\n"

Fossils shed light on primate origins\nArtists impression of South America\u2019s oldest monkey\nPhoto: Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez\nCecily Johnson on the discovery of the oldest New World monkey species\nGenes responsible for Asthma uncovered\n\"The\ndiscovery...\ncould shed\nlight on\nthe origins\nand early\nevolution\nof primates\nin South\nAmerica.\"\n\"Offers\npotential\ntargets for\nnew classes\nof drugs\nto treat\npatients of\nAsthma.\"\nThe discovery of three new\nfossilised monkey specimens\nin the heart of Amazonian\nPeru could shed light on the origins\nand early evolution of primates in\nSouth America; one of the most\ncontroversial issues in primate\npalaeontology.\nPrimatologists have long\nhypothesised that New World\nmonkeys travelled across the\nAtlantic Ocean from Africa after the\ncontinents were separated by plate\ntectonics 65 million years ago.\nIt is not uncommon for unfamiliar\nanimal and plant groups to appear\nabruptly in the fossil record of South\nAmerica after their arrival on the\nisland continent; however the earliest\nphases of the evolutionary history of\nmonkeys in South America have been\nthe subject of extensive debate.\nThis new discovery, published in\nNature, may provide the first real\nevidence for the African ancestry of\nplatyrrhine primates.\nFound in the sediment deposits of\na river bank in the Santa Rosa fossil\nsite, located in a remote region of\neastern Peru, the tiny fossils have\nbeen dated to approximately 36\nmillion years ago, during the Late\nEocene epoch.\nTheir discovery extends the fossil\nrecord of South American primates\nback by 10 million years; previously\nthe oldest known New World\nmonkeys dated from 26 million years\nago, during the Late Oligocene epoch\nin Salla, Bolivia.\nThe fossils were first discovered in\n2010, though it took two years for the\nfirst to be recognised as a primitive\nmonkey specimen as it was such an\nunusual find for South America.\n\u201cFossils are scarce and limited\nto only a few exposed banks along\nrivers during the dry seasons,\u201d\nsaid co-author Dr Ken Campbell,\na curator at the Natural History\nMuseum of Los Angeles County. \u201cFor\nmuch of the year high water levels\nmake paleontological exploration\nimpossible\u201d.\nUnder these difficult conditions,\nand at just a few millimetres across\nin size, it is unsurprising that the\nfossilised molars remained unstudied\nuntil now.\nThe initial identification spurred\non further efforts to analyse other\nassociated fossils from the Santa Rosa\nlocal fauna.\nResearchers have been searching\nfor a number of years in the Amazon\nBasin of South America, one of the\nmost biologically diverse regions in\nthe world, for clues as to its ancient\nbiological past.\nCampbell, working with a team of\nArgentinian palaeontologists, has\nrecently focused his efforts on eastern\nPeru in the hopes of understanding\nthe evolutionary origins of the area.\nPreviously, the gap in the fossil\nrecord before the Salla primates led to\nsignificantly different hypotheses on\nthe evolutionary history and origins\nof New World monkeys.\nThe new specimens contrast\nwith previously known extinct and\nliving South American primate\nspecies, instead bearing a striking\nresemblance to African anthropoids\nof the Eocene epoch. Phylogenetic\nanalysis suggests a relationship with\nAfrican taxa.\nWhile the researchers have\npresented three preliminary\nhypotheses, they state that more\nspecimens are necessary to narrow\ndown the ancestry of the newly\ndiscovered species.\nEpigenetic factors behind\nasthma and other allergic\ndiseases have been identified\nby a group at Imperial College\nin research that could lead to\nbetter targeted and more effective\ntreatments. Their paper, published\nin Nature, identifies 34 genes\nrelated to inflammation, inhibited\nin healthy people, but overexpressed\nin those with allergies.\nEpigenetics has been a bit of a\nbuzzword in biology in the past\nfew years, as it seems to provide\nan explanation for many complex\naspects of life that cannot be\nexplained by a na\u00efve interpretation\nof how our genes work.\nSimply having a gene doesn\u2019t\nmean it will be expressed.\nEnvironmental factors can turn\nthem on or off by adding methyl\ngroups at specific points on the\nDNA, which prevent it being read\nand forming proteins. Levels of\nmethylation have been linked to\nageing and the growth of cancers,\nand could even provide some\nexplanation for the beneficial effects\nof exercise, and the lifelong negative\neffects of childhood traumas.\nThe researchers analysed the blood\nof people with asthma and measured\nthe level of methylation of genes\nthat regulate the production of IgE\n(Immunoglobulin E), an antigen that\ncauses inflammation. They found 36\nlocations on 34 genes that had very\nlow levels of methylation in those\nwith asthma. There was a strong\ncorrelation between the activity of\nthese genes and the levels of IgE in\nthe patient\u2019s blood. These findings\nwere backed up by similar results\nobtained by a group in Canada.\nSome of the genes identified encode\nproteins produced by eosinophils,\na type of white blood cell known to\ncause inflammation in the lungs.\nDrugs to reduce the activity of\neosinophils are sometimes given\nto asthma sufferers, but this new\nresearch could allow genetic testing\nto identify people who could benefit\nfrom them. It also offers potential\ntargets for new classes of drugs to\ntreat patients whose asthma does not\nrespond well to current treatments.\n5 million people in the UK are\ncurrently receiving treatment for\nasthma, which is caused when the\nairways of the lungs become inflamed\nand narrowed, restricting the passage\nof air. It is closely related to eczema\nand hay fever, the so-called \u2018atopic\ntriad\u2019, which are also caused by high\nIgE levels.\nThe research was led by Miriam\nMoffatt and William Cookson\nfrom the National Heart and Lung\nInstitute. Professor Cookson said:\n\u201cOur pioneering approach, using\nepigenetics, allowed us to obtain\ninsights that we weren\u2019t able to get\nfrom traditional genetics. It isn\u2019t just\nthe genetic code that can influence\ndisease and DNA sequencing can\nonly take you so far. Our study shows\nthat modifications on top of the DNA\nthat control how genes are read may\nbe even more important.\u201d\nJames Bezer on Imperial\u2019s research in epigenetics asthma treatments\nAsthma affects millions of people.

It was lab\nweek, so although I was knackered\nfrom a long week of afternoons at\nthe bench, Friday was exciting and\nrewarding. I had finally completed\nthe third experiment of the term and\nobtained large, defined crystals. This\nseemed to bode well for the concert\nlater that night, or perhaps it placed\nme in a better mood in advance of the\nperformance. Going straight from\nlabs to pre-concert rehearsal was quite\na transition, but also a lovely way\nto celebrate the end of the week by\ndoing something that I love, besides\nChemistry!\nThe concert itself was an even\nbigger adjustment. Playing in the\nSibelius Hall, Helsinki, last summer\nwas an experience that I\u2019ll never\nforget. Performing in the Great Hall,\nright in the heart of a university so\nfocussed on science where we are\nused to academic work, was also\na unique experience. It was even\nmore exhilarating as the concert was\ncompletely sold out!\nThis undoubtedly lifted everyone\u2019s\nspirits and boosted the jubilance\nof our opening piece \u2013 Dvorak\u2019s\nCarnaval Overture, which received\nwonderful applause. The adrenaline\ncontinued on into my performance of\nProkofiev\u2019s Second Violin concerto,\nand I hope everyone enjoyed it\nas much as I did. The first half of\nthe concert was very well-received\nwith rounds of applause, and the\nsecond half was no exception. After\nMarquez\u2019s festive Danzon and\nRachmaninov\u2019s atmospheric and\nmuch more solemn Isle of the Dead,\nwe received a standing ovation!\nAll who attended the concert\nthat evening thoroughly enjoyed\nthemselves and we would like to\nthank those of you who came to watch\nus perform!\nAfter a restful break (apart from\nrevision for some), ICSO is gearing\nup for our next concert; Saturday 28th\nFebruary, 7.30pm at Cadogan Hall,\nnear Sloane Square. The programme\nincludes a varied repertoire and\nfeatures Martin James Bartlett, BBC\nYoung Musician of the Year 2014. It is\ndefinitely a concert not to be missed!\nThe programme opens with\nGershwin\u2019s An American in Paris,\nfull of jazz and saxophones. This is\nfollowed by Mozart Piano Concerto\nNo.20, with Martin James Bartlett,\nwhich is a total contrast to the first\npiece and a chance to witness the\nvirtuosity of the pianist. The second\nhalf has a Russian theme with\nBorodin\u2019s In the Steppes of Central\nAsia and Stravinksy\u2019s Firebird Suite;\nmusic from a mystic ballet of love\nand oppression.\nI am looking forward to returning\ninto the orchestra to accompany our\nsoloist and I can\u2019t wait to perform\nsuch a great programme!\nTickets can be purchased online, or in\nperson on 25th\nand 26th\nFebruary, at the\nBlyth Centre on 5th\nfloor of the Sherfield\nBuilding, as well as on the door.\nhttps://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/\norchestra/tickets.php\nCrystals and Concertos\nYingwei Ouyang gives her perspective\non her big night with ICSO\nOn Wednesday night I had\nthe pleasure of attending my\nfirst ArtsFest event of the\nyear \u2013 A Very Vocal Evening (3.0),\npresented by The A Cappella and\nMusical Theatre societies. All four\nestablished A Cappella groups gave\nperformances, and various solos and\nduets were performed by members of\nboth societies old and new.\nThe ladies and gentlemen of the A\nCappella society, many of them fresh\nfrom the International Competition\nof Collegiate A Cappella, performed\nversions of songs that ranged from\nclassic barbershop harmony to a\nsneak preview of the new Beatbox\ngroup, which will debut next\nThursday in Metric.\nMaking the crossover between A\nCappella and MT was Nick Bradshaw,\nwho performed with the Techtonics\nin the second half. He later gave a\nrendition of \u2018Moving Too Fast\u2019 from\nThe Last Five Years, accompanied by\njack-of-all trades Ehsaan Shivrani.\nEhsaan in fact featured in 12 of\nthe 17 acts presented at the evening,\nappearing separately as an on stage\npianist, a temp, an off stage pianist\nand an electric guitar player.\nThe evening had performers\nranging from their first year with\nthe society to individuals now on\ntheir third degree at Imperial, but\nthe focus was on the new. The Scopes\nperformed a new piece in addition\nto their normal set; Take Note are\nalmost entirely new following a\nrebranding from Girls\u2019 Barbershop;\nand there were no fewer than six\nperformers new to MTSoc this\nyear. Confident deliveries from\nHeather Campbell, Roshani Abbey,\nFarah Shair, David Phillips and\nthe aforementioned Nick Bradley\nserved to show that the society\u2019s\nupcoming productions do not lack for\nperformers!\nThis is the third year now that the\nevent has taken place, and audience\nnumbers were once again high. By the\nend of the second half, we were down\nto standing room only \u2013 the audience\napparently having been drawn in by\nthe promise of great singing and dad\ndancing.\nThe Artsfest Finale takes place tonight\n(Friday) in the Union Concert Hall.\nDoors 18:30, curtain 19:00.\nBEN HOWITT\nC&S EDITOR\nArtsFest: A Very\nVocal Evening 3.0\n\n"

One\nword can summarise her fashion choices: cheap.\nCharlie wasn\u2019t nominated for a Grammy, but she still\nmanaged to perform on stage \u2013 at the after party she went\nto.

However, this train wreck of a Jean\nPaul Gaultier gown did nothing for her figure. Yes, the dress accentuates her\ncleavage, but the deep plunging neckline with the high slit is far too much skin.\nIn the fashion world, there\u2019s a universal rule when it comes to dresses.\nIf you\u2019re going to wear a dress that accentuates your cleavage, then you\nshouldn\u2019t show too much leg, and if you\u2019re going to wear a short skirt, then\nyou shouldn\u2019t show too much cleavage (if you want to stay classy, that is.)\nUnfortunately, Kim\u2019s dress looks more like a sparkly dressing gown than a red\ncarpet worthy dress.\n\n"

The\nobservants offered up challenges\nfor the contestants to complete\nsatisfactorily, and they were\nImperial Hunger Games takes television world by storm,\nshots immediately fired\nscrutinised as they attempted to do\nso.\nThere was no food provided and\nonly water was available for the\nsubjects.\nThe contestants included two\nmembers of staff, one of whom has\nbeen branded the Serial Hall Killer.\nThe three students thrown into the\nmix were \u201cI represent the student\nbody\u201d Wom Theeler, vaguely familiar\nSports Don student, and Skilippa\nPhett, the Media Dictator.\nHowever, reaching a state of peace\nwas seemingly impossible, and\nwithin minutes the contestants were\nsnarling, arguing and throwing dirty\nlooks before completely turning on\neach other, or being brought down by\nthe observants.\nTheeler collapsed early on. Under\nthe immense social pressure to\nexplain why we pay Union entry\nfees, he slumped in the corner\nwhilst trying to search his pockets\nfor \u201cExcel Spreadsheets,\u201d seemingly\nhaving forgotten all contestants\nwere stripped of any factual, relevant\nknowledge before they entered the\narena.\nHis final blow was when he was\nchallenged on why students were not\ntold about the Weeks closure, which\nknocked him out completely, after he\nadmitted he couldn\u2019t remember when\nhe was first told about the decision.\nThe Serial Hall Killer was a stronger\ncontestant; her first tactic when\nchallenged about the Weeks closure\nwas to lull everyone into a comatose\nstate by using long, sweeping\nsentences including numerous\ntransparent \u201cbuzzwords,\u201d including,\nironically, the word \u201ctransparent.\u201d\nWhen attacked with a sleak \u201c2-Class\nSociety division between expensive\nand cheap halls\u201d swipe, she started\nthrowing out lowered rent prices left,\nright and centre.\nHowever, those observing were\nquick to dismiss such futile tactics\ntoo, throwing increased rent prices\nback in her face.\nShe eventually admitted defeat,\nonce realising that she had no\ndefinite answers to really solidify any\nchance of victory in the arena. She\nannounced she would need back up,\nand bowed out shortly after.\nSkilippa\u2019s aggression and \u201cshade\nthrowing\u201d offense tactic increased\nthe tension between herself and\nother contestants to the point she was\nignored.\nShe was left throwing controversial\nbut pointless blows into the arena,\nsuch as \u201cWhy bother sending\nstudents to College Council if they\ndon\u2019t listen to their views?\u201d\nSports Don staved off attacks from\nother contestants from being on the\n\u201cstudents are ignored\u201d offence.

It even had\na hashtag, to encourage student\nengagement, another myth STOIC\nare struggling to prove with other\nprojects.\nThe arena was emptied after\njust one hour, after all contestants\nseemed emotionally exhausted, and,\nin the case of Theeler and the Serial\nHall Killer, practically catatonic.

Fujiwara shows\nus how we have moved, through\nthe years, from coal to creativity,\nand explores what happens when\nhappiness is treated as just another\ncommodity.\nOther curators represent British\ninstitutions in different ways, be it in\na positive or negative light. Hannah\nStarkey takes the Arts Council\nCollection as her starting point; the\nworld\u2019s largest loan collection of\nBritish modern and contemporary\nart, it is the Collection\u2019s wide range\nof photographs that have provided\nthe inspiration for Starkey\u2019s witty,\nbleak view of modern Britain. Like\nFujiwara, Starkey attempts to portray\na country that has fallen in love\nwith the allure of consumerism,\ncontrasting images taken from\nadvertising with grim photos, often\nin black and white, showing social\nisolation and alienation.\nOne of the highlights of Starkey\u2019s\ncollection are Paul Graham\u2019s\nphotographs, taken in social security\noffices around the country in\nthe mid-80s. With their decrepit\natmosphere, the photos highlight \u2013\nin garish technicolour \u2013 those who\nhave been abandoned by a welfare\nstate that promised so much for\nso many. Elsewhere we have Chris\nKillip\u2019s images; in one, a woman lies\nface down on a wooden bench, her\nskirt being blustered by an invisible\nwind; in another, a crying child from\nTyneside brings his knees up to his\nface, displaying his worn boots to the\ncamera.\nWhilst Starkey shows the worst\nof Britain, she also shows us some\nof the best things that come out of\nthe country, including a sense of\nradicalism that runs deep through the\nUK like a vein of Welsh coal. Who\u2019s\nHolding the Baby?, a series of text\ncollages from the Hackney Flashers\nCollective, highlights the poor\nchildcare provisions for working class\nwomen; looking like a precursor of\na riot grrrl zine, the black and white\ntext confronts the viewer, in a radical\ndisplay against authority.\nFrom this group of radical\nfeminists we move onto another:\nChristine Voge\u2019s pictures of a\nChiswick-based refuge for women.\nThe first of its kind in the UK, the\ncentre was soon overwhelmed,\nholding up to four times its allocated\ncapacity. These are the selection\nof Jane and Louise Wilson, whose\ncollaborative collection reinforces\nthe idea that twins often share an\nuncanny mental connection. Their\ncollection focuses around British\nconflicts of the 20th\nCentury; unlike\nthe current jingoism on display\ncentred around the centenary of\nWWII, the Wilsons look much\ncloser to home, focussing on the\nIrish Troubles and the Greenham\nCommon Women\u2019s Camp, which\nsprung up in protest to the decision\nto place cruise missiles at the RAF\nbase. A row of photographs of graffiti\nmake up Conrad Atkinson\u2019s Northern\nIreland 1968 \u2013 May Day 1975, under\nwhich a series of quotes centred\naround the Northern Irish conflict\nare printed on orange, white, and\ngreen paper. By placing them so close\ntogether, Atkinson brings together\nthe personal and the political,\nshowing us the people behind the\nslogans.\nSuch British radicalism is also\ncelebrated in John Akomfrah\u2019s\nselection of BFI-funded films,\nmany of which are experimental in\nnature; the majority centre around\nhome-grown artists, such as Francis\nBacon, Richard Hamilton, and\nBarbara Hepworth, whose work was\ninherently ground-breaking. While\nthe majority of the films do seem\ninteresting, they are just too long.\nThe 17 total films on display have a\ncombined running time of over ten\nhours; while I do have a lot of time for\nvideo art, quite frankly there\u2019s only so\nmuch one person can take.\nThe same accusation can be levelled\nat Roger Hiorns, whose display\nconsists of a collection of research he\nhas done on the Bovine Spongiform\nEncephalopathy outbreak and\nresulting media hysteria, which\npeaked in the mid-90s. The only\nfitting word I could think of is\nexhaustive; this is not a compliment.\nThe amount of content that Hiorns\nis trying to fit into the three rooms\nis enough to make a serial hoarder\nembarrassed; along the wall there are\nscientific reports in plastic wallets,\nentire TV news programmes on the\noutbreak, and whole governmental\nprotocols on controlling the outbreak.\nHiorns would certainly benefit from\nanother curator, one who could help\nhim cut down his extensive collection,\nand sadly his section marks the lowest\npoint in the exhibition.\nConceived also as part of the run-up\nto this year\u2019s general election, the\nHayward\u2019s show does indeed succeed\nin showing that Britishness is defined\nby our shared histories. It may not\nshow us where we are going, but it\ncertainly shows us where we have\nbeen, and \u2013 while some curators could\ndo with a more confident hand in\nlimiting their content \u2013 is overall a\nvery compelling exhibition. Britain\nis a huge topic to take on, one whose\nboundaries are not easily defined, but\nthe 7 artists on display have by-and-large managed to show us that history\nis, indeed, occurring right now.\nHistory Is Now: 7 Artists Take On\nBritain is on at the Hayward Gallery\nuntil 26th\nApril.

Perhaps\nthe initial resistance was due to the\nopera\u2019s controversial nature painting\nthe main character of a prostitute\nas a human and a victim, but it was\nnot until the 1880s that Verdi\u2019s\nintentions were realized. In this\nmodern production with the English\nNational Opera however, director\nPeter Konwitschny is acutely aware\nof the timeless appeal and relevance\nof love, death, and the hypocrisy\nof society. What struck me was the\nminimalism of the production, with\nbasic, monochromatic costumes and\nhardly any set \u2013 a story that could\nhave happened anywhere, in any\nperiod of time.\nVerdi\u2019s multi-faceted social\ncommentary sees Violetta, a high-class prostitute, falling for the\nbookish admirer Alfredo, who moves\nher with his devotion and sincere\nbelief in living true to oneself. She\nfollows him to the countryside, where\nAlfredo\u2019s father Germont eventually\nfinds her and, in order to preserve\nhis family\u2019s honour, convinces\nher to leave his son. Livid at this\nperceived betrayal, Alfredo publicly\ndenounces Violetta in one of the most\ngripping scenes of the opera, where\nthe socialites rush back on stage\nafter leaving for dinner to hear his\nvicious words. With napkins tucked\ninto their fancy clothes and wielding\ncutlery like weapons, the party-goers\nare bent over with anticipation, eyes\nhungry for drama and Violetta\u2019s\nimminent downfall. This is the same\nbunch that attended her party in the\nfirst scene, supposedly celebrating\nher recovery with her. The hypocrisy\nis shocking, yet uncomfortably\nreminiscent of real life.\nFirst performed in 2013,\nKonwitschny\u2019s La Traviata is on\na revival with most of the cast\nreturning except the role of Violetta;\nElizabeth Zharoff is new to the role,\nyet she captivates from start to end\nwith her delicate yet unyielding\ndelivery. Her singing mirrors her\ntransformation from a confident\ncourtesan to a passionate lover to a\nvictim of social hypocrisy resigned to\nher tragic fate. Ben Johnson\u2019s Alfredo\nwas convincing as a socially awkward\nbookworm, and although his singing\nbegan weakly, he did pick up from his\nearnest imploring of Violetta to get\nher to renounce her socialite lifestyle\nfor a life of \u201creal emotions\u201d.\nKonwitschny feels that Violetta\nis the only human character in the\nshow \u2013 even Alfredo, whose sincerity\nis stirring at the start, turns around\nto destroy what he fought so hard\nto achieve. Indeed, the chorus was\nkey to bringing out the main themes\nof the opera, from their polite but\ninsincere celebration at the start, to\ntheir hunting down of Violetta at\nthe end, as well as their presence on\nstage while she sings of her fate in the\ndarkness. It is her solitary, doomed\nfight against the duplicity of society\nthat moves us, and which makes her\ndeath seem like a final salvation.\nPlot progression makes effective\nuse of the very basic set: a sole wooden\nchair and several red curtains, from\nwhich Alfredo enters Violetta\u2019s life\nand through which Germont comes\nto disrupt their down-to-earth\nexistence in the countryside. As\nAlfredo\u2019s ideals of love and passion\ntake hold in Violetta, the two slowly\ndraw the curtains to the sides,\nmirroring her revelation. When they\nmeet again in the last scene, in which\nAlfredo repents but Violetta is too far\ngone in her illness, the two sing while\npushing back imaginary curtains,\nclinging on to an illusion of what they\nhave lost.\nDespite, or perhaps because of,\nthe minimalism, staging is varied\nand interesting \u2013 from the fluid\nmovements of the chorus, to the last\nscene where Violetta is the only one\nleft on stage, the placements carried\nthe themes very well. A strange\naddition that was not in Verdi\u2019s\noriginal piece was the actual character\nof Germont\u2019s daughter on stage,\ninvoked to guilt-trip Violetta into\ngiving up Alfredo, whose affair with\na prostitute has ruined his sister\u2019s\nchances of a respectable marriage.\nAwkward and equally bookish, the\ngirl was out of place and seemed to\nme almost a hindrance to the whole\nscene.\nLa Traviata was also the first opera\nI have seen sung in English, which\ntook some adjusting to at the start\nwhen characters sung passionately\nin English libretto. Perhaps it is the\nromanticism of foreign languages,\nbut at some points the vernacular\nEnglish phrases were somewhat\ncomical when sung in earnest\nvibratos. Nevertheless, it was a good\ntranslation and it was nice to be\nable to understand without my eyes\nhaving to dart from subtitles to stage.\nWith the intertwining of a\ntragic love story with slick social\ncommentary, carried by the voices of\nthe impressive cast, Konwitschny\u2019s\nproduction pruned the opera to\nits essence, and the result is sharp,\nrelevant and clever.\nLa Traviata is on at the London\nColiseum until March 13th\n.

Monet, Renoir,\nPicasso, Degas, Rodin, C\u00e9zanne, van\nGogh, and Klimt amongst others\ndominate the public perceptions\nof art in the 1880s-1910s, and with\ngood reason. Some of the biggest\nmovements in art history took\nplace in that period; it was the\nbirth of modern art in the form of\nimpressionism, the beginnings of\ncubism. At the turn of the century\nthe age of the avant garde had started\nsweeping through Europe, leaving\nSargent looking somewhat stuck in\nthe archaic realism of yesteryear.\nHe and his paintings were regarded\nby many of his contemporaries as\naccomplished but lightweight \u2013\npandering to his rich patrons rather\nthan contributing to the innovative\ncanon of European art of the era.\nModern critics have often taken\nthe same view; Sargent has gained\na reputation for painting portraits\nthat depict the moneyed literati and\nsociety heiresses of Paris and London.\nA virtuoso but with an oeuvre that is\nstaid and facile.\nSargent: Portraits of Artists and\nFriends at the National Portrait\nGallery tries to dispel this. It mostly\nsucceeds. The subjects themselves are\nwhat we would expect from Sargent;\nthe paintings number his artsy\nbohemian friends, a distilled \u2018who\u2019s\nwho\u2019 of European society of the age.\nAmongst Sargent\u2019s sitters are Henry\nJames, Treasure Island\u2019s Robert Louis\nStevenson, Auguste Rodin, Claude\nMonet, and WB Yeats, considered by\nsome the greatest English poet of his\ngeneration. Each painting is charged\nwith expression and character, and\neach figure has arresting eyes that\npierce the viewer, anchoring them to\nthe moment depicted.\nAndy Warhol said of Sargent \u201c[he]\nmade everybody look glamorous.\nTaller. Thinner.\u201d Indeed, within the\nnearly 70 portraits exhibited, there is\nno unsightly mole or wrinkle in sight.\nSargent seems to conjure the sitters\nfrom pure light, illuminating their\nface and drawing them out of their\nshadowy backgrounds with the skill\nof a sculptor. The paint suggests at,\nrather than delineates, the contours\nand planes of his subjects. Sometimes\nhands disappear altogether in\nan insouciant flourish into folds\nof clothes, the colours whirling\nand smudging into one another.\nHe sometimes leaves parts of the\ncanvas unpainted, as in his portrait\nof Vernon Lee, which captures the\n\"Each\nfigure has\narresting\neyes that\npierce the\nviewer.\"\n\"His\nemphasis\nwas placed\ncapturing\nlight\non the\nsubjects.\"\nEdouard and Marie-Louise Pailleron by John Singer Sargent, 1881.

It was the tenth\nanniversary of Stephen Fry as\nhost, and he was as delightful and\ncharming as always, from getting\nBirdman nominees Edward Norton\nand Michael Keaton to kiss him\n(rather than his traditional \u2018blow\na kiss to the camera\u2019), to imitating\nStephen Hawking.\nHawking himself got one of the\nbiggest laughs of the night, after\nbeing announced by Felicity Jones\nas \u201cthe only man on the planet\nmore intelligent than Stephen Fry\u201d,\nhe added \u201cyes, and better looking\u201d.\nPawe\u0142 Pawlikowski, winner of\nthe Best Film not in the English\nLanguage expressed his confusion\nat the BAFTAs, having previously\nwon Outstanding Debut by a British\nWriter, Director or Producer for\nLast Resort in 2001 and Oustanding\nBritish Film for My Summer of Love\nin 2005, quipping that \u201cyou might\nas well give me the fellowship award\nnow and save time\u201d.\nDue to a timing clash with\nthe Director\u2019s Guild of America\nAwards, which had been the\nprevious night, most of the\ndirectors were absent, including\nWes Anderson, whose film The\nGrand Budepest Hotel won five out\nof its eleven nominated awards.\nWhen he won the the Best Original\nScreenplay award, he got the star of\nhis film, Ralph Fiennes, to read a\nspeech he has written in the event.\nThis speech was very well recieved\nby the audience, featuring such\ngems as \u201cI was already unhappy to\nBEST FILM: BOYHOOD \u2013 RICHARD\nLINKLATER AND CATHLEEN SUTHERLAND\nBEST DIRECTOR: RICHARD LINKLATER BEST ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE: EDDIE\nREDMAYNE\nBEST ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE:\nJULIANNE MOORE\nBEST ACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE:\nPATRICIA ARQUTTE\nBEST ACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE: J.

    "content": "30 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n20.02.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe co-artistic director of renowned theatre company\nRidiculusmus speaks to Max Falkenberg about schizophrenia,\nthe creative process, the brutality of arts funding and throwing\ntomatoes at comedians.\nInterview: Jon Haynes in Conversation\nThe afternoon I meet Jon\nHaynes on Bond Street, I really\nshould have better things to\nbe doing. With a lab report due in\n24 hours and a rehearsal to plan\nfor later in the day, this interview\ncouldn\u2019t come at a much worse time.\nBut this opportunity is too good\nto miss. With numerous awards\nand an enviable reputation as the\npioneers of \u201cseriously funny theatre\u201d,\nRidiculusmus is at the forefront\nof British fringe theatre and I\u2019m\nchatting to the man behind half\nof their creative vision. Gaunt and\nserious looking, Jon has something\nominous about him. As their website\ntells us, Jon won awards at school\nfor speaking Greek verse; and after\ntaking drugs at university and having\na nervous breakdown, Jon founded\nRidiculusmus with his partner David\nWoods. Somehow I get the feeling\nthat Jon is the serious part of their\n\u201cseriously funny\u201d dynamic. That said,\nhe strikes me as a pretty good guy.\nFounded during their time at The\nPoor School in the 80s, Jon, David\nand their partner Angus started out\nbusking comic songs from the 20s and\n30s. Although little came of it, a free\nroom above a couscous restaurant in\nKentish Town saw the trio open The\nTomato Club. Named after the section\nwhere they would invite comics who\n\u201cconsidered themselves bad enough\nto appear\u201d, the audience were armed\nwith overripe tomatoes and the rest\nyou can guess. Although the idea\nsounds funny, Time Out didn\u2019t agree\nsaying \u201cthe publicity advises \u201cdon\u2019t\ncome\u201d\u2026 sounds like advice worth\ntaking\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t their comedy\nthat got them kicked out. As Jon\ntells me, the restaurant asked them\nto leave after tomato seeds started\ndropping through the floorboards. I\nguess the joke had gone too far, but\nto me it almost feels like that\u2019s what\nRidiculusmus\u2019 brand of anti-comedy\nis all about.\nIn much the same fashion, their\nfirst full show bombed spectacularly.\nHaving by chance been offered to\nfill a slot at the Canal Caf\u00e9 Theatre\nbut with no show to put on, the trio\nrustled up an adaptation of Three Men\nin a Boat, mainly because it had three\nmen in it \u2013 what other reason do\nyou need?! Well I guess many other\nreasons since, as Ian Shuttleworth put\nit, \u201cThey\u2019ve seriously underestimated\nwhat it takes to whip up some light\nfrothy entertainment\u201d. Picking\nout Jon for some personal praise,\nShuttleworth wrote: \u201cWhen he leaves\nthe stage it seems more full\u201d. High\npraise for the other two I guess.\nThe relationship between\nperformers and critics has always\nbeen a little odd. On one hand,\nperformers are often reliant on critics\n\"Jon Haynes\nis one of the\npioneers of\nseriously\nfunny\ntheatre\"\n\"The\nrelationship\nbetween\nperformers\nand critics\nhas always\nbeen a little\nodd\"\nJon Haynes (background), with his partner David Woods (foreground), in Ridiculusmus\u2019 The Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland Photo: Ridiculusmus Theatre Company\n\n"

The Provost\u2019s\nBoard is made up entirely of College\nstaff and currently has no student\nrepresentative present.\nIt took just under an hour to\nmeet the hundred signature target\nneeded to call an Emergency\nCouncil Meeting, after the petition\nwas launched Tuesday night. An\nemergency Union Council meeting\ncan be called into action by any\nstudent, as long as they have the\nsignatures of one hundred Imperial\nCollege Union members.\nUnion Council members were\nemailed late Thursday evening by\nPaul Beaumont, Union Council Chair\nto confirm plans for the meeting,\nwhich will take part next month.\nThe Weeks Hall committee have\nyet to submit a formal paper, but\nBeaumont stated in the email that it\nwill most likely address the process\nby which Union Council made its\ndecision, and the lack of consultation\nwith the residents and the members\neffected by the closure.\nWeeks residents will also be\nmeeting with Debra Humphris, the\nPro Rector (Education), Wheeler and\nother members of staff who were\nbehind the decision to close the hall\nin the first place.\nThe Weeks Hall committee have\noutlined on their petition that they\nare concerned that the decision made\nby Union Council was not truly\nrepresentative of the opinion of the\nstudent body, and that it was done\n\u201cWithout sufficient attention given\nto the detrimental effect on student\nexperience.\u201d\nThey also describe how they are\nconcerned no representative of the\nhall was present at the meeting,\nand there is a lack of information\nsurrounding the closure.\nNo one at Council was informed\nas to when the hall may close and\nwhat changes may be done to the\ninternal structure for its new purpose.\nThe new purpose also has yet to be\nfinalised.\nFranca Hoffmann, a subwarden of\nWeeks, told Felix: \u201cWe have called\n[for] an emergency Council meeting\nso there is a specific time allocated to\ndiscuss the topic properly, and also to\nshow that students feel strongly about\nthe closure of the hall.\u201d\nFelix spoke to the Hall committee\nahead of their petition launch, to hear\ntheir thoughts on the closure.\nSaid one member: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure\nif they had come to us before [the\nCouncil meeting], and told us they\nhad plans to close Weeks, we would\nhave launched a petition sooner to\ngather support. We would have gone\nto the Council if we had known it was\nhappening.\u201d\nOne stressed that the hall is a\nvaluable asset for students, being so\nclose to campus and also relatively\nlow in cost compared to Southside,\nEastside and Beit. \u201cIt\u2019s only a home\nto 66 people, but it is still changing\n66 people\u2019s lives and changing their\nstudent experience as they can afford\nto live in halls so close to campus.\u201d\nCurrently, all en suite single rooms\nin Eastside and Southside halls are\npriced between \u00a3186 to \u00a3203 a week.\nEvery room in Weeks is priced at\n\u00a3157 a week, and all are single-bed.\nAnother voiced concern over the\nlack of communication between\nthe hall and the Union. \u201cFor them\n[the Union] to say they thought\ncollege had spoken to us already, its\nfrustrating. They are the Union, they\nrepresent students, and they should\nask us.\n\u201cIf you are going to represent\nthe students, you have to ask the\nstudents, you don\u2019t assume someone\nelse has.\u201d\nAnother thought that the onus\nlay on College to tell the hall what\nwas happening, and that this is\nnot the first instance College have\nmade decisions without considering\nthe student\u2019s opinions. \u201cIt seems\nproblematic that the College is\nputting the Union Council in this\nposition.\nThe College didn\u2019t ask the students\nwhen it came to Garden Halls, and\nthey are doing it again.\u201d\nAdded another member: \u201cImperial\ndoesn\u2019t do anything against this\nimage of it being a \u201cmoney-making\u201d\nmachine. They can afford not to care\nbecause of its ranking and how its\noversubscribed by applications as\nwell.\u201d\nThe paper presented to Union\nCouncil included a number of\nmotions, with one being the proposal\nto campaign against the closure of\nWeeks and also Pembridge Hall.\nThe Union Council voted not to\ncampaign against the decision, with\n18 out of 30 agreeing that the space\nshould be used for \u201cacademic and\nnon-academic space,\u201d as quoted in the\npaper.\nThe Weeks blackboard contains years of history Photo: Katy Sayers\nOne Wee\nThey did vote in favour of fighting\nthe decision to close Pembridge Hall.\nDiscussions during the meeting\nincluded the potential for Weeks to\nbe turned into a childcare facility, in a\nbid to make Imperial more attractive\nto academics with children, both\nthose that are presently employed\nby the College and those who may be\nconsidering applying.\nIn the Union Council meeting, it\nwas stated by Wheeler that the hall\nwas an \u201cinefficient use of space\u201d, with\nthe rooms being far bigger than those\nin Eastside, Southside and Beit, and\nalso costing less.\nWeeks was donated to the College\nby the British Engineering firm\nVickers back in the late 1950s, and is\n\n"

In an age when it is just as\neasy to speak to a friend in Lagos as\nit is to phone our grandparents in\nWoking; when foodie culture means\nthat everyone\u2019s palate is globally\neducated; when people can move\nthrough the EU at will, breaking\ndown notions of private borders; what\ndoes it really mean to be British?\nIt is this question that has been\nposed to seven artist-curators in the\nSouthbank Centre\u2019s show History Is\nNow, in which the years 1945-2015\nare radically reinterpreted, and the\ncultural legacy of the second half\nof the 20th\nCentury is celebrated.\nDoes Britishness mean a sleeping\nvideo of David Beckham, as it does\nto Simon Fujiwara? Or perhaps it is\nbest represented by governmental\nreports on BSE, the offering of Roger\nHiorns? Certainly everything in\nBritain is not peachy keen; this much\ncan be ascertained before you reach\nthe exhibition, when one spies the\nsurface-to-air missile installed on the\nHayward Gallery\u2019s roof, ominously\npointing to an invisible target.\nThe missile forms part of the\ncollection of Richard Wentworth,\nwho looks back to his childhood\nfor inspiration; the oldest of all\nthe curators, Wentworth sees the\nyears 1940-60 as a formative period\nfor British culture. The end of the\nwar lead to a widespread, if uneasy,\noptimism, as Britons took their first\nnew steps into a brave new world of\nTV sets and polyurethane. This shift\ntowards consumer culture is reflected\nin Tony Cragg\u2019s work Britain Seen\nfrom the North, in which a jumble\nof plastic flotsam forms the outline\nof the British Isle; tilted on its side,\nthe country seems prone under the\nweight of its newly accumulated\nwealth. It was this optimism that lead\nto the foundation of the Hayward\nGallery, part of the Southbank Centre\ndevelopment created during the\nFestival of Britain, an irony that\ncannot be overlooked.\nHowever, not all was peaceful in the\nland of plenty. While they seemed\nto be free of the threat of invasion, a\nvein of violence still ran to the core\nof British society; we therefore have\nHenry Moore\u2019s bulbous sculptures,\nunnerving in their fluidity, and\nFrancis Bacon\u2019s psychological\nexplorations of the human form, in\nwhich figures seem to melt into each\nother. Robert Capa\u2019s shots of the\nD-Day landings, iconic in their shaky\nquality, show that we will indeed fight\nthem on the beaches; but Lowry\u2019s\nscene of a popular sandy shore shows\nthat we will live, laugh, and love on\nthe beaches too.\nPerhaps what is at the heart of\nbeing British lies in our institutions;\nthe NHS, for example, which is the\ncountry\u2019s largest employer, and\nwhich forms the centre of Barbara\nHepworth\u2019s Hospital Drawings series,\npart of Wentworth\u2019s display. This\nidea of institutions is continued by\nSimon Fujiwara, whose curation of\na number of artefacts of Britishness\nis inspired. Taking as inspiration the\nfundamental shift from material to\nimmaterial production that occurred\nduring the reign of Thatcher and\ncarried on for the next thirty years,\nFujiwara\u2019s collection manages to be\nboth eclectic and focussed.\nThe role Thatcher played is\nrepresented by the costume worn\nby Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady, a\nwhite-washed biopic of the divisive\nleader who fundamentally altered\nthe British economy; next to it we\nhave a ton of coal, taken from the\nMinorca Surface Mine, one of the\ncountry\u2019s last open coal mines. This\nsmooth slab, which was hewn from\nthe very earth, seems as unfamiliar\nand unnatural as a piece of alien\ntechnology, a fact that is subtly\nalluded to by Gavin Turk\u2019s Trash, a\nbronze case of a bin bag. In fact, it is\nsomewhat ironic to have Thatcher\nrepresented here; how could she have\nbelieved in \u2018British Values\u2019 when she\nstated that \u201cthere is no such thing as\nsociety\u201d, a claim succinctly refuted\nby the brooms used by community\nclear-up teams following the Summer\n2011 riots, on display next to Streep\u2019s\ncostume.\nAbove all, Fujiwara\u2019s collection\nreveals the contradictions inherent\nwithin British society. Our obsession\nwith class and aspirational lifestyles\nis represented by empty packets of\nWaitrose herbs and Nigella Lawson\nsalad servers, which are juxtaposed\nagainst a place setting for The Clink\nRestaurant, a charity scheme that\nemploys and trains prisoners. The\ncontrast between physicality and\nimmateriality is shown through Prem\nSahib\u2019s Sweat Panel, which creates\nthe illusion of a steamed mirror\nthrough the meticulous application\nof hundreds of resin drops.

So you wouldn\u2019t have blamed\nthe trio for giving up there, but they\nremained adequately stubborn.\nWith a suggestion to perform The\n3rd\nPoliceman from an audience\nmember, an absurd, surrealist play\nalmost perfectly suited to the trio,\nRidiculusmus as a serious company\nwas born. With an extensive tour and\nthe support of a few more enlightened\ncritics, the company set up as a\nresident company in Derry, Northern\nIreland.\nWith a small amount of funding\nand an urge to relieve some\nboredom, the trio began working\non more experimental methods for\ndevising original work and came up\nwith The Exhibitionists. Although\nreasonably successful, the show left\nthem unsatisfied. In an attempt to\nperform an Indian epic, audiences\nstarted walking out, and with Jon\u2019s\npersonal life starting to collapse, the\ncompany seemed at risk. Having\nbeen briefly sectioned during his\ntime at university in Sheffield, Jon\nfelt alienated in Northern Ireland.\nAngus left the trio to move into\nfilmmaking, and after a painful stint\nliving in an industrial unit in Belfast,\nthe duo decided to risk everything on\ntwo shows at the Edinburgh fringe\nin 1999. Although the book Jon\nsends me after the interview paints a\nrather bleak picture of their time in\nNorthern Ireland, Jon tells me that it\nwas there that Ridiculusmus finally\ndiscovered their artistic vision.\n\u201cSeriously funny theatre\u201d was born.\nThe Exhibitionists & YesYesYes\nopened to rave reviews with\nYesYesYes garnering a number of top\nawards including Time Out \u2018Best Off\nWest End production\u2019 in 2000 and\nTotal Theatre\u2019s award for \u2018Best British\nProduction\u2019. With a smattering of\nfresh publicity and an extensive tour\nacross the UK and abroad, YesYesYes\ngave Ridiculusmus their first chance\nat real funding and linked them with\na number of big players.\nOver the last 15 years, Ridiculusmus\nhave continued the artistic vision that\ngave them their first break. Focussing\non a number of two-handers, Jon tells\nme a little about the creative process\nbehind the majority of his work;\n\"When\nstarting out\non a project,\nthe team\nusually have\nfew ideas set\nin stone\"\nstarting out on a project, the team\nusually have very few ideas set in\nstone. With little more than an idea\nabout the number characters, a week\nis spent improvising, sometimes with\na number of collaborators, sometimes\njust the two of them. Recording all\nthe material, Jon tells me that they\n\u201ctranscribe everything, no matter\nhow banal and shit, word for word,\num for um\u201d. A little odd, but Jon\nswears to me it works. \u201cPhilip Roth\nused to spend a year writing 8 hours\na day \u2013 total shit\u201d. The main talent of\nthe writer was putting up with your\nown shit \u2013 \u201cGod this is terrible!\u201d But\nafter a year \u2013 or in Ridiculusmus\u2019\ncase, a week \u2013 they\u2019d come back and\ntry to pick out anything that had a\nlittle life. Jon tells me they\u2019re looking\nfor conflict or drama; I\u2019m pretty sure\nthey\u2019ve found it.\nWith the few sparks of life picked\nout and a core idea to work on, Jon\nand David can spend months to\nyears researching their ideas. With\nno director, touring becomes an\nintrinsic part of the creation process:\n\u201cWorking the show out as we perform\nto an audience, in a way the audience\nbecome our director\u201d. The audience\u2019s\nimmediate response lets the duo work\nout line for line what\u2019s funny and\nwhat\u2019s not.\nWhen they started out on The\nEradication of Schizophrenia in Western\nLapland, the duo had only settled on\ntwo things; they wanted to work with\ncollaborators and they wanted to\nbase something on a family. With a\nweek dedicated to development work\nat the National Theatre Studios,\nit became clear that mental health\nwas a recurring theme in their\nimprovisations. David\u2019s father had\nexhibited psychosis while he was\ngrowing up before his brother also\ndiscovered that he had \u201cthe gene that\nmakes you flip\u201d.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where madness starts,\namongst the pieces and the teacups\u201d,\nJon notes while talking about the\nfocus on the family. While he tells me\nhis time in a psychiatric ward didn\u2019t\nparticularly influence the production,\nhe recalls that there was a man on his\nward who would tell rambling tales\nabout how the novelist John Fowles\nhaving stolen his wife; Jon didn\u2019t\nbelieve any of it, but years later what\nhe had thought of as delusions turned\nout to be all true. Were his character\u2019s\ndelusions in Eradication all meant\nto be true? Of course not, but the\nimplication is rather amusing.\nTwo years and one script later,\nthe show began touring, and as you\ncan imagine with such a touchy\nsubject, responses to the depiction\nof psychosis were mixed. \u201cA\nschizophrenic was not happy with\nme saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, it\u2019s not\nlike that. You need to be a lot more\nworked up.\u201d\u201d Others argued that\ndelusions were very personal, internal\nthings; if you\u2019ve been through\npsychosis, it is understandable not\nwanting to be represented on stage.\nBut in their challenging position\nas theatre makers, Jon insists that\n\"The fiscal\nsadism\nof the\ngovernment\nmeans there\njust isn\u2019t\nenough\nmoney\"\nRidiculusmus\u2019 ultimate goal is to\nentertain. Even if the subject matter\nis bleak, you want to make people\nlaugh.\nSet up so that the two performances\nwere running simultaneously, Jon\ndescribes the challenges of such a\ncomplex play. \u201cThe problem is trying\nto act this very weird script where\nyou\u2019re trying to be in the moment\non one side but need to fully pay\nattention to the other side\u2026you can\nnever really get lost in the piece in\nthe typical method acting way\u201d. As\nJon points out: \u201cthere\u2019s no rule about\nwhat mental illness should be\u201d, and\ncertainly not in how it should be\ndepicted.\nAnd from that springboard, Jon\ntells me about Ridiculusmus\u2019 next\nproject. With Eradication having\nbeen the first part, the duo are now\nfocussing on the second instalment\nin a trilogy on alternative discussion-based therapies for mental health.\nWith trials running in South\nCarolina, the treatment of therapy-resistant PTSD in war veterans is\nthe theme for their next instalment.\nPremiering at the Melbourne Festival\nin autumn, the performance will see\nJon playing a veteran living in a box\nin his kitchen with David out the back\ndoor trying to convince Jon to have\nthe MDMA treatment.\nBut even with the best intentioned\nplans, an ominous thought hangs\nover our discussion. Jon tells me\nthat they\u2019ve recently been rejected\nfor funding from the Arts Council.\nAlthough Jon insists the Arts Council\nvalue Ridiculusmus, apparently they\nare better suited to a project based\nfunding model: \u201cThe fiscal sadism of\nthis Government\u2019s slashing means\nthere just isn\u2019t that much money to\ngo around\u201d. Having lost their spot\nat the Barbican\u2019s Pit Theatre due\nto funding, and with no manner\nin which to sustain the company\nwithout external support, Jon fears\nthey might have to close. \u201cIf we don\u2019t\nget [the project funding], I don\u2019t know\nwhat we\u2019re going to do... It\u2019s a fragile\nexistence\u201d. Without the funding to\ncarry out their research, who knows\nwhether they will be around at all\nin a couple of years. I certainly hope\nthey are. Their work may not be\nconventional, but Ridiculusmus\u2019\ncreative vision is unique, and we\ncannot underestimate how important\nthat is for the arts today.\nTowards the end of our discussion,\nJon tells me about an article written\nrecently by David Edgar. Entitled\nDeath of the Playwright, the article\nargues that the devised theatre\nis pushing out the old idea of the\nplaywright. But that\u2019s not the point.\nTheatre is a collaborative art and all\nthat matters is the end product, what\nis shown on stage and what people\nwill remember. While Edgar might\nbe right that devised work often is\npoorly thought out, Ridiculusmus\u2019\ncomplete devotion to their art and\nincredible focus in creating work is\ntoo valuable to the British theatre\nscene to just lose overnight.\nJon Haynes, in Ridiculusmus\u2019 The Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland Photo:\nRidiculusmus Theatre Company\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\nFELIX 20.02.2015\nMusic\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk Music Editors Grace Rahman & Amna Askari\nJoshua Renken chronicles the continuing reinvention of one of\nBritain\u2019s best-loved bands\nThe evolution of Arctic Monkeys\nBorn and bred in Sheffield,\nArctic Monkeys are an English\nrock band that formed in 2002.\nMost commonly associated with The\nLibertines and The Strokes, Arctic\nMonkeys consist of front man Alex\nTurner (lead vocals, rhythm guitar,\nlead guitar), Jamie Cook (lead guitar,\nrhythm guitar), Nick O\u2019Malley (bass,\nbacking vocals), and Matt Helders\n(drums, backing vocals). In the nine\nyears since their debut album release,\nthe Arctic Monkeys have released\nfour more studio albums, won seven\nBrit awards, performed during the\nLondon Olympic Opening Ceremony\nand headlined Glastonbury. Twice.\nAs the principal creative force\nwithin the band, Alex Turner brings\nto the group his distinctive northern\naccent and fiercely intelligent\nsongwriting. His brilliantly knowing\nobservations manage to capture a\nscene in a remarkably short amount\nof time. From the beginning he\ndisplayed emotional maturity beyond\nhis years and is deservedly hailed by\ncritics as British indie rock\u2019s finest\nlyricist.\nArctic Monkeys burst onto the\nmusic scene in 2006 with their first\nLP Whatever People Say I Am, That\u2019s\nWhat I\u2019m Not. This album explored\nthemes such as relationships, youth\nculture, prostitution and nightlife in\na way that felt freshly witty and to\nmany, beautiful. Alex Turner\u2019s pace\nof delivery varies, but many of the\nslower tracks sound like the drunken\nslurs of a horny poet in the early\nhours.\nThe final track in this album, \u2018A\nCertain Romance\u2019, still epitomises\nwhat Arctic Monkeys are capable\nof. With an immaculate bass riff\nduring the verses, a climactic trickling\nguitar melody and perceptive vocals\nthroughout, this song describes\nand reconciles chav subculture\nwith astounding eloquence. Rightly\nconsidered to be one of the greatest\nindie rock songs of all time, \u2018A Certain\nRomance\u2019 is as perfect a pop song as\nyou could ever hope for.\n\u2018Favourite Worst Nightmare\u2019 (2007)\nwent to No. 1 in the charts and carried\nalong a similar vein to their debut\nalbum, albeit with more aggression.\nThe raw beats and rapidly delivered\nlines on tracks like \u2018Brianstorm\u2019,\n\u2018Balaclava\u2019 and \u2018Old Yellow Bricks\u2019\nmade for an exhilarating sound that\nwas balanced out by the melancholy,\nintimate ballads such as \u2018505\u2019 and\n\u2018Only Ones Who Know\u2019.\nThe band\u2019s third album, Humbug,\nis the most hit and miss of the five.\nMorose and mysterious in equal\nmeasure, Humbug represented a\nsignificant shift in Arctic Monkeys\u2019\nmusical direction. With a much\ncalmer but more challenging sound,\nthis LP separated the band\u2019s listeners\ninto fans who loved them all the more\nand casual followers who preferred\nthe unpretentious and grittily\ncharming tales of love and nightlife\nthat featured in their first two\nalbums. Third albums are notoriously\ndifficult for bands in the limelight\nbut Turner\u2019s lyrical flair continued\nto impress. \u2018Humbug\u2019 featured fewer\ncatchy hooks than many would have\nwanted but also included some real\npearls. Tracks such as \u2018Cornerstone\u2019\nand \u2018Dance Little Liar\u2019 reassured fans\nthat Arctic Monkeys were here to\nstay. Four boys had become men.\nWith Suck It and See (2011), Arctic\nMonkeys had returned to making\nmore accessible and less moody music\nthan they had with Humbug. However,\nmany of Turner\u2019s songs were less\ninteresting than his usual output\nand felt hollow by comparison. This\nsmall dip in lyrical form was most\nevident in \u2018Brick by Brick\u2019, which\nis perhaps the weakest track Arctic\nMonkeys have ever released despite\nthe strong instrumentals. \u2018Piledriver\nWaltz\u2019 takes you on a sublime\njourney of soft psychedelic rock with\ninventive allegorical lyrics, and \u2018Love\nis a Laserquest\u2019, \u2018Suck It and See\u2019 and\n\u2018That\u2019s Where You\u2019re Wrong\u2019 serve\nas a strong trifecta to conclude the\nalbum. This fourth album showed\nsmall changes in the band\u2019s sound,\nbut in terms of development Suck\nIt and See is Arctic Monkeys\u2019 least\nsignificant LP of the five.\nThe band\u2019s most recent creation,\nAM (2013), marks the second\nmetamorphosis of Arctic Monkeys.\nThis hip-hop influenced album\nfeatures an impressive variety of\nsongs ranging from the thunderous\n\u2018Do I Wanna Know?\u2019 to the gracefully\nironic ballad \u2018No. 1 Party Anthem\u2019.\nAM represents a return to top form\nfor the band, where big riffs and\ncatchy hooks accompany mindfully\ncrafted, penetrating lyrics. With this\nLP Arctic Monkeys have also made\nhistory as the only independent\ngroup whose first five albums have all\ngone to the top of the charts.\nIt would be ridiculous for Arctic\nMonkeys to still be writing the kind\nof songs that they produced at the\nbeginning of their career, simply\nbecause the band\u2019s circumstances\nhave changed so much. They no\nlonger live the life of a plucky\nunderground band skulking around\nSheffield. Now it\u2019s all private jets and\ncourting supermodels in America.\nIn five short years Alex Turner has\nswapped jumpers and long hair\nfor leather jackets, sunglasses and\na slicked back quiff in a transition\nevery bit as seamless as the band\u2019s\ndeparture from their previous\nalbums. Masters of reinvention,\nArctic Monkeys cannot easily be\npigeonholed. They are still maturing\nand refining their sound; who knows\nwhat they\u2019ll come up with next. Bring\non album number six.\nI\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Sheffield anymore.

The story of Christian\nGrey (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia\nSteele (Dakota Johnson) in the Fifty\nShades trilogy however has become a\nlaughing stock in the literature world\nsince its publication, with many\nrightfully criticising the horrendous\n\u201cinner goddess\u201d narrative voice of\nAna, as well as all the other times\nauthor E. L. James made the readers\nlaugh unintentionally. But Kelly\nMarcel\u2019s script attempts to scrape\naway as much of that as possible, in\nan attempt to make something at\nleast half-serious out of what initially\nstarted off as Twilight fan fiction.\nAnd the effort seems to have paid\noff in certain respect, as the film is\nnot nearly as trashy or cringing as one\nwould expect. Sure there are lines of\ndialogue here and there that sound\na little off, but most importantly,\nthe film remembers to approach the\ndifficult, taboo subject matter with\na sense of well placed humour. The\nfirst half that involves absolutely\nno BDSM whatsoever is the initial\ncourting phase, one that is not afraid\nfor its characters to let loose and poke\nfun at each other.\nNow, the much-anticipated scenes\nof BDSM do occur, but director Sam\nTaylor-Johnson plays them relatively\nsafe and stylish, despite the 18\ncertificate received here. Perhaps this\nwas a conscious decision to avoid the\nmuch dreaded NC-17 classification in\nthe States which automatically turns\nany film into a virtually unscreenable\none, but regardless there is a sense\nthat just a few extended snapshots\ninto the world of BDSM fall short\nof doing the character of Christian\nGrey justice. We get the feeling that\nthe Red Room of Pain is not fully\nexplored here for whatever reason,\nand the surprisingly safe, restrained\n(no pun intended) approach comes as\na disappointment.\nThroughout the film Grey\u2019s\ntroubled past is hinted at, no doubt\na teaser for things to come in the\ntwo sequels that have already been\nthe go-ahead signal by the studios.\nBut instead of expanding the cold,\nsteely-eyed, and supposedly heartless\nbillionaire\u2019s central role in the story,\nthe film gets stuck in a frustratingly\nrepetitive loop in which the girl starts\nwhining for more commitment, and\nthe guy starts resisting and just wants\nkinky sex. You get the feeling the\nfilm is thirty minutes too long, and\nnumerous ultimately pointless scenes\nreally ought to have been left on the\ncutting room floor.\nDakota Johnson is without doubt\nthe best aspect of the film. The\ncasting department has found a\nreal talent with Johnson, whose\nFIFTY SHADES OF\nGREY\nDirector: Sam Taylor-Johnson\nScreenplay: Kelly Marcel, E. L.\nJames (novel)\nCast: Dakota Johnson, Jamie\nDornan, Eloise Mumford,\nMarcia Gay Harden\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nastonishing performance of innocent\nna\u00efvet\u00e9 gives the film a convincing\nfemale protagonist, as a slightly\nawkward, inexperienced young\nwoman. Johnson also knows how\nto get in touch with Ana\u2019s more\nplayful, cheeky side, as she toys with\nChristian\u2019s needs and emotions.\nPlaying opposite her, Dornan\narguably has the more limited,\none-dimensional role, but he plays\ndamaged and disturbed well, setting\nthings up nicely for how his role may\n(or may not to be fair) develop in\nfuture films. He is, as he says in the\nfilm, \u201cfifty shades of f***ed up\u201d.\nExpect an abrupt ending, as the\nfranchise will take at least the next\ntwo years to properly finish. The\nsupporting characters we barely get to\nsee here, should feature more, and a\nbigger delve into Christian\u2019s past will\nwork to the advantage of the sequels.\nPhoto: Sam Taylor-Johnson, Universal Pictures\nPhoto: Sam Taylor-Johnson, Universal Pictures Photo: Sam Taylor-Johnson, Universal Pictures\nPhoto: Sam Taylor-Johnson,\nUniversal Pictures\n\n"

Credit: Kerry Clark\nDepression sucks, there\u2019s no\ngetting around that. It\u2019s awful\nand makes you feel like you\u2019re\nnot in control of your own emotions,\nsleep pattern, or motivation. But\nsomething that\u2019s worth remembering\nis that it\u2019s not unmanageable.\nIn my years of dealing with\ndepression and anxiety, there have\nbeen a few things I\u2019ve picked up\nthat have helped me cope a little bit\nbetter with day to day events, and I\u2019m\nsharing them with you in the hopes\nthat it might help make recovery just\nthat little bit easier for you.\nGet Out of Your Head\nThe most important step I have found\n(besides getting professional help\nof course!) is to learn to recognise\nobsessive thoughts and stop them\nbefore they can go too far. Something\nthat depression, anxiety, and\ncountless other mental illnesses do\nto us is that when we find something\nthat makes us upset, it makes us dwell\non it.\nIt\u2019s not a conscious decision to\nsink deep into thought and try to\noveranalyse everything, and it\u2019s not\nyour fault, it\u2019s just what they do to\nyour brain, and the key is to learn to\ncatch these obsessive thoughts just as\nthey come in and stop them pulling\nyou down into a spiral of obsessive\nthoughts and sadness.\nDistract yourself! Watch your\nfavourite TV show. Call up a friend.\nGo out for a walk. Drag yourself out\nof the house, no matter how much\nyou want to just lie on your bedroom\nfloor and cry, I promise you\u2019ll feel\nbetter after you get out of the house\nand more importantly, out of your\nown head.\nSet Small Goals\nSet tiny little goals for each day,\njust something that will get you out\nof bed in the morning. When I was\nfirst put on medication, and every\ntime the dosage is altered or there\nare other radical changes to my\nprescription, I take a massive hit to\nmy motivation. Setting goals makes\nsure that I actually get up and stop\nthinking about why I\u2019m miserable\nall the time.It can be something as\nlittle as washing the dishes, or reading\na chapter of that book you\u2019ve been\ndying to read.\nWhen you\u2019re depressed, it\u2019s so\ndifficult to motivate yourself to do\nthings, because everything seems\nlike a challenge, even small things,\nso every little win counts. A word of\ncaution though, don\u2019t be too harsh\non yourself if you\u2019re feeling too bad\nto complete something on your task\nlist. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a failure, it\njust means you\u2019re having an off day,\njust try your hardest to stick to it the\nnext day.\nDon\u2019t be alone\nI\u2019m not saying be with people 100%\nof the time, we all need alone-time.\nBut don\u2019t isolate yourself from the\nworld. I can\u2019t talk for everyone, but I\nknow for me, it gets worse when I try\nand just lock myself in my room all\nday alone with my thoughts. Try and\norganise activities during the week\nthat get you to hang out with other\npeople.\nFind Happy Little Things\nDo something that makes you happy\neveryday. For me, this ended up being\ndoodling and painting, but it can be\nanything, knitting, writing, playing\nvideo games, reading, anything.\nDepression makes you forget what\nyou used to enjoy before it struck,\nso maybe take some time and try\nto rediscover things that used to\nmake you happy. I know it can be\nfrustrating to be unable to get joy\nfrom many things, but it\u2019s worth\ngiving it a try, especially if you can\nremember why you liked doing what\nit was you did that made you relaxed\nand happy.\nNew Hobbies are Great\nDiscover new hobbies and activities.\nLearning to do something new, even\nif it\u2019s something inconsequential like\nlearning to knit, scrapbook, or draw\ncan be super motivating. It makes\nyou feel accomplished, which in turn\nmakes you feel a little less annoyed\nand angry with yourself.\nThese are just little things that have\nhelped me on my road to recovery,\nand not all of them will be easy\nchanges to make, but it\u2019s definitely\nworth giving them a try. And\nremember, don\u2019t suffer in silence.\nTalk to someone if you\u2019re struggling\nand think you might need a little help\nto get through, there is no shame in\nasking for help!\n\"Get out of\nthe house\nand out of\nyour own\nhead.\"\n\"Rediscover\nthings that\nused to\nmake you\nhappy.\"\nIf you are concerned about\nyour own mental health,or\nthat of a loved one,there are\npeople out there you can talk\nto who can give you advice,or\nwill be there to listen.\nHelplines\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr helpline):\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nwww.samaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety Help :\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 09:30-17:30)\nwww.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10:00-22:00)\nwww.nopanic.org.uk\nEating Disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,13:30-16:30)\nAddiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nwww.alcoholics-anonymous.\norg.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nwww.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health\nCentre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\n\n"

    "content": "18 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n20.02.2015\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park and Jack Steadman\nEx Machina was released at the\nend of January, a film I would\nrecommend to many people.\nWritten and directed by regular\nDanny Boyle collaborator Alex\nGarland, it explores the concept of\nthe definition of humanity through\nthe paradigm of artificial intelligence\nwhere the plot sets in motion a Turing\ntest (a test devised to test a machine\u2019s\ncapacity to exhibit intelligent\nbehaviour akin to that of a human).\nWatching the film got me thinking\nabout the merits of science fiction\nas a genre of film. A lot of the time\nscience fiction is heavily degraded\ndue to false assumptions about its\nmaturity as a genre. Opinions which\ncan be attributed to the likes of Star\nWars and the various exploits of\nthe Superhero genre of the Marvel\nproduction company create this\nimage of the fan base of this genre\nand therefore our expectations of\nit. You know what I\u2019m talking about\n\u2013 you see a few around Imperial:\nGlasses wearing, acne-ridden, slightly\noverweight, awkward when talking\nto members of the opposite gender,\nand possessing a strange penchant for\nAnime.\nAlthough it has to be said there are\npeople like this, myself fitting some\nof these descriptions at some point\n(Being 14 was a dark chapter in my\nlife), it leads to the neglect of one of\nthe most influential and thought\nprovoking genres available. For me,\nscience fiction includes the fantastical\nelements of Action and Fantasy\nthereby creating the cinematic\nspectacle that is demanded by the\naverage cinema goer, which is allowed\nto act as a backdrop to tell a more\nserious message of social realism or\nphilosophy that would otherwise\nget forgotten about in the wallows\nof portentous indie drama. For my\nmoney, there are a few recurrent\nthemes that are usually explored in\nintelligent Science Fiction: Society\nand class; what it means to be human;\nand human relationships and their\ntranscendence.\nEx Machina, as mentioned before,\nplays on the theme of what it means\nto be human through exploring the\nconcept of whether or not artificial\nintelligence can be possible as\nwell as if emotions, thoughts, and\nconsciousness exist, can a robot\nbe considered human. This is a\nfundamental work of Descartes,\ndealing with the concept of self which\nin any other genre would probably be\nconsidered pretentious (see the eye-scratchingly inane I Heart Huckabees)\nbut since the genre of science fiction\nallows the creation of worlds and\nconcepts that are fictional but with\nthe proviso of being feasible \u2013Ex\nMachina prompted Stephen Hawking\nto express his worries at the dangers\nof AI. This theme is featured heavily\nwithin the 1982 classic Blade Runner\nwhere the artificially intelligent\nreplicants of Deckard\u2019s world who\nwere created in order to fulfil a\nsubservient role to humans start to\nbreak from their programming in\norder to discover what it means to be\nalive. Within this theme there also\nlies a recurrent motif of the desire of\nfreedom, occurring in Kubrick\u2019s 2001:\na space odyssey with HAL\u2019s rebellion\nor through the leaving of Scarlett\nJohansson\u2019s AI operating system in\nthe 2013 film Her.\nSociety and class is an issue usually\ntackled in some gritty British film,\nbut is more frequently present\nin Science fiction. Besides the\naforementioned Blade Runner, the\nmost commercially and critically\nsuccessful science fiction work\nthat tackles this issue is that of\nNeill Blomkamp\u2019s District 9. Set\nin Johannesburg, the immediate\nparallel is that of the apartheid, but\nreplacing the oppressed race with\nAlien Refugees that live in shanty\ntowns, segregated from the rest of\nthe population. Although this may\nnot be the most subtle of metaphors,\nit is still an extremely interesting\nbackdrop for this film to take place.\nAnother interesting case of this,\nalbeit far less alien infested, is that\nof Never Let Me Go where classes of\npeople are raised to be organ donors\nfor higher social classes, focussing on\nindividuals who reside in this state\nand their endeavours in trying to\nescape from their role in society. It\ntouches on the desire for autonomy\nfrom the state but at the centre of\nit resides an emotional core which\nassists in delivering the warning of\noverpopulation and the rebellion\nagainst reinforcement of class roles.\nDespite the humungous budgets of\nmany Sci-Fi films, the most effective\nstories that they can tell is that of\nhuman relationships, forming the\nmain attraction of the film with the\ninterstellar space travel being used as\na mere platform to convey this. The\nobvious example (as you may have\nguessed) is that of the recent Dylan\nThomas enthused Christopher Nolan\nepic Interstellar \u2013 despite it\u2019s reported\nbudget of 165 million dollars, and\nthe extensive theoretical physics\nthat Kip Thorne was responsible for\ndevising, the central story is that of\nthe relationship between a father and\ndaughter and the fact that thousands\nof light years can note break the bond\nand duty of family. Nolan is an auteur\nat creating movies with million dollar\nbudgets whose central dogma is far\nbeyond that of any other blockbuster\nmovies, but is frequently neglected\nfrom the awards both because of\nthe blockbuster status and the\nassumptions about the science fiction\ngenre \u2013 a Science Fiction film has\nFather and Daughter share a moment, Interstellar. Photo: Christopher\nNolan, Paramount Pictures\nWhat is human? What gives us the right to decide? Left: Ava, Ex Machina \u2013 is she conscious? Right: Rachel, Blade Runner \u2013 she thinks she human. Why should we disagree?\nPhoto: Alex Garland, Universal Pictures. Ridley Scott, Warner Bros.\nnever won the best film award.\nWith this all said, it may sound\nlike the average cinema goer requires\nsome sort of explosion to get them\nto engage there brain at the moving\npictures in front of them; however\nit is far from it, but it cannot be\ndenied that with the variety of\ngenres that tackle philosophy or\nideas of the self, Sci-Fi is the one\nthat permits and allows for the most\ncinematic spectacle within a genre,\nwhilst manipulating the audience\nto consider themes that they would\nperhaps not consider in other\ncircumstances, making it the most\nexciting and innovative genre in\ncinema today.\nFrom Ex Machina to Blade Runner\nJonathan Masters explores the merits of Science Fiction\n\n"

In\nmy ignorance, I know practically\nnothing about Arthur Miller.\nArguably one of the greatest\nplaywrights of the twentieth century,\nat least a superficial understanding\nof Miller\u2019s work should probably be\nexpected from me, but not even that\ncan I offer. Clueless, but with great\nanticipation, it was in this mind-set\nthat I walked into the Wyndham\u2019s\nTheatre for their production of A\nView from the Bridge.\nOne of Miller\u2019s early works, the play\nportrays the relationship between\nItalian American longshoreman\nEddie Carbone and his orphaned\nniece Catherine. Set in 1950s\nBrooklyn, two of Carbone\u2019s cousins\narrive illegally from impoverished\nSicily. The strong silent Marco\ncontrasts the lavish, platinum blond\nRodolpho who, falling in love with\nCatherine, unearths a deep seated\njealously and unease in Eddie. A\ntragedy in which each character draws\nsympathy from the tense audience,\nthis is unlike anything I have seen\nbefore. With no one individual to\nlabel the villain, an overwhelming\nagitation builds throughout the\nperformance.\nMark Strong\u2019s piercing eyes are\na sight to behold. Imposing and\npowerful, Strong\u2019s immaculate focus\nand complete dedication to his role\nas Eddie is not only completely\nconvincing but also builds a\nbeautifully sympathetic character\nwhose desire for respect and loyalty\nhit the audience right at their heart.\nLittle can be said to describe the\nbeauty with which this production\nhas been crafted. Directed by the\nBelgian Ivo Van Hove, best known as\nthe artistic director of Toneelgroep\nAmsterdam, the display is simple and\npolished. A single doorway is placed\nin the centre of the grey background\nwith the audience surrounding the\naction on three sides. The stage is\nblank with a continuous glass bench\nmarking its perimeter. Known for his\navant garde, experimental approach\nto theatre, Van Hove has focussed\non the subtleties of each character.\nMr Alfieri, a lawyer who narrates\nthe story of Carbone is placed as\nan integral part of the production.\nPlayed by Michael Gould, Alfieri\nobserves the action from the back\nof the stage, the whites of his eyes\nhighlighting a deep, unsettling\npressure on the characters.\nParticular credit should be given\nto Phoebe Fox who, in her role as\nCatherine, is both immediately\nlovable and remarkably powerful\nin confronting Strong. Delicate and\nkind, Katy\u2019s influence on Eddie is\nheart-warming and makes this play\u2019s\ntragic story all the more painful.\nThe bleak grey costumes and mute\nlighting give the play a distinct aged\nfeeling. With Alfieri\u2019s narration, the\nproduction comes across as a snapshot\nfrom a black and white film with its\ndistinct air of hindsight going far to\ncrush the American Dream.\nIt is odd reviewing such an\noverwhelming production. I try to be\nsomewhat objective, critical and still\nembed my opinion into the piece,\nbut with this, that\u2019s just not so easy.\nAs much as I want to objectively\nanalyse the piece, on this occasion,\nmy emotional response far outweighs\nanything else I could say. With\npulsing church music running in the\nbackground and a drum punctuating\nmoments of heightened tension,\nit almost feels like it is Van Hove\ndeciding when I should breath, when\nmy heart should beat and when I\nshould cry. As Alfieri tells us, \u201cI could\nsee every step coming, step after step,\nlike a dark figure walking down a hall\ntowards a certain door.\u201d\nSo could the audience, but we\nwere powerless. Like a well-planned\nceremony, this production ripped up\na man\u2019s pride while we watched it rain\nblood from above.\nA View from the Bridge is on at\nWyndham\u2019s Theatre until April 11th\n.\nMark Strong and Phoebe Fox in A View from the Bridge at Wyndham\u2019s\nTheatre.

The panel consisted of; Tom\nWheeler, ICU President; Debra\nHumphris, Vice-Provost Education;\nOli Benton, ACC Chair; Bridge\nDuncombe, Chemistry DUG; and\nPhilippa Skett, Felix Editor.\nQuestions were asked by the live\nstudio audience, who were able to\nsubmit questions online in advance.\nA broad range of questions were\nasked, ranging from the Weeks Hall\nclosure to the legacy of sabbatical\nofficers. Audience members consisted\nof interested people, including many\nresidents of Weeks Hall.\nOver the course of the hour long\nprogramme, viewers could watch live\non the Imperial College Television\n(ICTV) website and YouTube, as well\nas joining in the debate on Twitter\nusing the hashtag #iql. One person\nwho watched the show live, RCSU\nPresident Serena Yuen, told Felix\n\u201cI really enjoyed watching IQL\nlast night \u2013 I thought it was really\nwell executed and there was a wide\nvariety of questions leading to good\ndiscussion on some relevant topics.\u201d\nThe director of the show was Pete\nBrook, who told Felix \u201cIt\u2019s really\nexciting to have put on our first live\nshow since the redevelopment of the\nImperial Questions Live looks\ninto the tough subjects\nPhilip Kent reports on ICTV\u2019s exciting new show\nwest basement. It is a culmination\nof months of hard work by ICTV\nmembers to make the studio firstly\nhabitable and then functional. I\u2019m\nexceptionally proud of everyones\nhard graft.\u201d\nOne of the main themes from the\ndebate was over the way the College\ncommunicates with students.\nNotice was given to the Union\u2019s\nconsultation framework, while Debra\nHumpries made note of wishing to be\nmore transparent with students.\nOne of the more contentious\npoints aside from Weeks Hall was\nthe Union\u2019s entry fees. Tom Wheeler\ndescribed how the revenue from entry\nfees (around \u00a325,000) gets reinvested\nin Union services, although others\nquestioned why the Union\u2019s bars\ndoesn\u2019t appear attractive to students.\nPhihippa Skett, who sat on the\npanel, told Felix, \u201cBeing on the\npanel was a lot of fun, and i really\nenjoyed the experience. I think it is\nvital that we can directly ask senior\nmembers of the Union and College\nquestions about the issues that are\naffecting students, as I feel that often\nthese people sit in their offices and\nforget what it is like talking to actual\nstudents once in a while.\u201d\nICTV\u2019s next broadcast will be\nthe annual production of Meet the\nCandidates, where viewers can watch\ncandidates for next year\u2019s sabbatical\nofficers debate with each other. This\nwill be broadcast live in two weeks.\nThe panel live on air. Photo: ICTV\n\"There\nwas a wide\nvariety of\nquestions\nleading\nto good\ndiscussion\non some\nrelevant\ntopics.\"\n\"I think\nit is vital\nthat we can\ndirectly\nask senior\nmembers\nof the\nUnion and\nCollege\nquestions\nabout the\nissues\nthat are\naffecting\nstudents.\"\nHow did IQL happen?\nThe workload of Imperial students is unashamedly\nhigh\u2013are we able to do all the things we want whilst\ncontinuing with our degrees? Probably not.Nonetheless,\nI feel there is a significant deficit in the way the College\nand Union interacts with students,and makes them\naware of the issues they care about.Students don\u2019t have\nthe time or patience to attend Union Council or other\nmeetings which may be of interest,perceiving them\nas boring,drawn out and allowing a few people to talk\naimlessly for a long time (something I hope the Union\u2019s\nDemocracy Review will work on).\nDespite the reputation of apathy at Imperial,I remain\nconvinced that if people are given information in the\nright format,they are fundamentally still interested in\nthe decisions and topics which affect their (and future\ncohorts\u2019) lives as students.A Question Time format is\none viewers are accustomed to,and importantly,allows\nfor a two way exchange and debate.Key to this,the\naudience ask the questions and follow up with panellists\nshould they be unhappy with the answers they hear.\nPerhaps it was the act of getting our panellists out of\ntheir comfort zone and in to a studio with lights trained\non them,or the audience of\u2018non hack\u2019students which\nchanged the dynamic.Judging by the messages received\nafterwards,we achieved some margin of our goal (or\nmy friends are just really kind to me).Even being a\nTrustee and having worked with Tom Wheeler (Union\nPresident),I felt I understood the pressures he faces\nbetter following the show.\nI for one,am immensely proud that we managed to\nproduce the show,of the panelists for taking part,the\naudience & viewers for giving us so many questions\nand the ICTV tech team for producing a high quality\nbroadcast,despite technical hitches.I hope this will\nbecome a termly event now: the only way is up for\nImperial Questions Live!\nIQL host Thomas Lim. Photo: ICTV/Cem Hurrell\nA taster of\nwhat was\ndiscussed\nClosure of Weeks\nWeeks found out about the\nclosure of the Hall from Felix\u2019s\nTwitter feed after the Council\nmeeting.\nTom Wheeler can not recall\nwhen he first became aware of\nthe closure of Weeks although\nminutes suggest he knew about\nthe closure last December.\nNot fighting the closure is\nbeing pragmatic,it recognises\nthe wide ranging changes\nhappen to College\u2019s portfolio of\ncampuses and accommodation.\nTom and Wheeler say there is\nno chance of a campaign to save\nWeeks.\nBridge says We need to trust\nstudents and build better\ncommunication.\nWhat does College do to supoort\nteaching?\nChanged the promotion\ncriteria-can not be prompted\npurely on research,and can not\nexcuse poor teaching.\n20th\nAnniversy of President\u2019s\naward,things like supervision\u2013\nall need student nomination\nWhy does the Union charge an\nentry fee?\n\u201cBecause it is budgeted for and\nif to remove that there will be\nless money going on everything\nelse we spend it on.\u201d\nACC Bar nights,almost filling\nthe Union to capacity-make only\n\u00a3150.A venue in Fulham can offer\ncheaper drinks and make money.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t the Union run a\nmodel that incites our own\nstudents into the bars to use and\ncreates a market.Suggest you\nneed to review your model fully.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n20.02.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy Weeks is worth saving: a h\nWeeks Hall was kindly\ndonated to Imperial\nby British engineering\nfirm Vickers in 1959 to be used\nas affordable undergraduate\naccommodation. Ungratefully,\nCollege have now rejected this\ngenerosity and plan to make \u201cmore\nefficient\u201d (i.e. more profitable) use of\nthe space.\nWeeks is one of the few remaining\nhalls near campus that are, on\naverage, cheaper for a single\nroom when compared to Eastside,\nSouthside and Beit, but last week,\nUnion Council voted against the idea\nto lobby College to keep it open.\nApparently, turning the building\ninto academic space or childcare\nprovision will be cheaper than\nrenovating the bedrooms, which I\nmust add, are in perfectly acceptable\ncondition and are a joy to live\nin. Although saying that, a hall\ncontaining the UK\u2019s second ever glass\nencased lift and is ten stories high is\nobviously the safest and most suitable\nplace to open a childcare centre...\nRegardless, there are endless\nreasons why Imperial needs\nreasonably priced undergraduate\naccommodation on campus and\nthousands have benefitted from\nliving in Garden, Weeks, and\nEvelyn Gardens Halls thus far.\nCollege is failing to acknowledge\nthere are students from low-income\nbackgrounds who have a right\nto study here just as much as the\nwealthy.\nA gap in the new, proposed rents of\naround \u00a395 between those who will be\nliving in Acton and living on campus\nwill create a two-class society. Priced\nat \u00a3170 per week for a standard room,\nWeeks Hall would still provide the\nmiddle ground financially and would\nallow less wealthy students to enjoy\nthe benefits of living on campus.\nThis two-class society will also place\nthe rich at an academic and social\nadvantage, since they will be able\nto stay in the library until late and\nnot have to worry about missing the\nlast tube home, and will have several\nhours more per week to join the 300+\nclubs and societies which Imperial\nproudly boasts.\nNeither the Union Council, nor\nTom Wheeler are to blame for this\nsituation. The manner in which the\nUnion Council paper about the hall\nwas worded did not give Weeks the\nchance to be saved. Council, made\nup of students from many different\ncommunities within college, vote on\nvarious topics during these meetings,\nand will not always have a vast\nknowledge of everything they vote\non. We feel the paper detailing the\nclosure of Weeks gave no background\ninformation that they should have\nknown before deciding on whether\nto campaign to keep it open or not,\nand this information could have\nbeen sought through involving the\ncommunity of Weeks.\nThe motion to close the halls was\none of several other points within a\nlong, complex paper, and we feel it\nwas not paid enough attention as a\ntopic, and, as a result, we are calling\nan emergency council meeting to vote\non the topic again.\nClearly information flow within\nthe student and staff body has failed\nif nobody representing Weeks Hall\nwas informed of the issue, even\nthough it was first raised at a Union\nCommunity & Welfare Board\nmeeting last December.\nAs a resident in Weeks Hall two\nyears ago, I lived through the closure\nof Garden Hall and recall the outrage\namongst the student community. Yes,\nGarden needed a new lick of paint,\nbut it was clean, functional and had\ncharacter.\nI remember the first time I saw\nGarden\u2019s wooden lounge and feeling\nextremely lucky to have access to such\na historical and beautiful building.\nTriple rooms cost just \u00a374 a week,\nwhich was truly wonderful, and if it\nwasn\u2019t for Garden Hall, many of my\nfriends would not have been able to\nstudy here.\nUpon deciding the time of closure\nfor Garden Hall, apparently it was\ngoing to be \u201crenovated\u201d into offices\npractically immediately. Well, I have\nbeen inside, and almost two years\nlater, every bed, every wardrobe,\nevery bedside cabinet is still there.\nHomemade \u201cSOS\u201d campaign posters\nare still in the windows. Whoever\nbranded Weeks \u201can inefficient use\nof space\u201d, please do visit Garden Hall\nand inspect the millions of pounds\nworth of space that you have been\nwasting for two years.\nNow as a Hall Senior in Weeks,\nI have bitterly told my Freshers\nthe \u201cstory\u201d of Garden Hall, while\nthey sit open-eyed and struggle to\nimagine what lays behind the pretty\nwhite fa\u00e7ade they walk past every\nday. College thinks it can get away\nwith such outrageous changes to the\naccommodation system because in\nthe future, nobody who remembers\nwhat there once was will be around to\ncomplain.\nNext year\u2019s cohort won\u2019t know\nwhat they are missing out on. College\ndeals with these unfair decisions\nbased on the knowledge that whoever\ncampaigns against them will soon be\ngone, and whoever will lose out as a\nresult will be unaware of the previous\nalternatives available.\nAfter the closure of Garden,\nthe warden of Wilkinson Hall\nkindly agreed to take on the extra\nresponsibility of merging Weeks with\nWilkinson, under the assurance that\nWeeks would remain open for the\nforseeable future.\nThis was clearly not the case, and\nit is now not just the community of\nWeeks that will suffer, but also that\nof Wilkinson and Gabor. Brunches,\nBBQ\u2019s and parties are held jointly\nbetween Wilkinson & Weeks and\nGabor on a regular basis, with the two\n(technically three) halls sharing social\nspaces. 376 students will be losing\none of the best social spaces Imperial\nhas to offer, not just the residents of\nWeeks.\nKaty Sayer discusses why Council need to change their mind about campa\nAfter the initial Against Acton\ncampaign, College assured us that\nrent in Woodward Hall would be\ncheap as a compromise to make up for\nthe fact that students will have to live\nat least a forty minute commute away\nfrom campus, in a not so nice area.\nAt least one year later, with a new\nstudent Council, this compromise\nseems to have been forgotten, with\nCollege recently leading the Union\nCouncil to vote on apparently\n\u201creducing\u201d rent in Woodward Hall\nto an average of \u00a3120 but paid for by\nextortionate increases in Eastside and\nSouthside rents to \u00a3200-215.\nThat College thinks it is acceptable\nto force Princes Gardens residents to\nsubsidise the cost of Woodward Hall\nastounds me.\nTeenagers are attracted to historic\nuniversities such as Oxford and\nCambridge, and if Imperial wants\nto compete with such institutions,\nincreasing student satisfaction\nwill involve building up not just a\nreputation for academic excellence,\nbut also one for tradition, both of\nwhich will encourage more donations\ntowards the College endowment will\nresult.\nOxbridge heavily subsidise student\naccommodation, and in this case\nthe responsibility of subsiding an\nunpopular hall in Acton should be\ncast onto the College rather those who\nwant to live closer to campus.\nCollege and the Union seem to be\nobsessed with the figure they have\nmanaged to achieve through number\nmanipulation of an average rent of\n\u00a3166 per week. As one of the more\nreasonably priced halls, keeping\nWeeks open would actually decrease\nthis average and would reduce the\nneed to increase Princes Gardens rent\nso extortionately.\nIt is also worth noting that this\nThe lovely Wilkinson and Weeks team of hall seniors, subwardens and wardens.
