While few of us wish to know the future, many hope reasonably \u2014to have a hand In shaping It; and this\nrequires acquaintance with what may lie ahead.

We, for\nour part, would like to elaborate what lies along\none of them\u2014Unilever Research.\nA IN l DO lU Research In Unilever means Industrial research:\nresearch directed to specific ends: research with a practical outcome. But not only that. No industrial\nproject or problem stands in isolation. Its roots rarely\nHe In industry. So, research in Unilever also means\nresearch in a number of contrasting fields\u2014detergents,\nedible fats, foods, cosmetics\u2014and It means, further,\nresearch in surface chemistry, gly ce ride chemistry,\nprotein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental\ntopics. It means a community of scientific Interest within\nUnilever, and continuity of academic contact outside It.\nIt can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction\nto the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.\nIt can provide satisfaction In the pursuit of it and\nfinancial reward in the success of it. There is only one\nminor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.\nWe Invite you to write to Dr. A. CROSSLEY, Staff Officer,\nResearch Div., Uflilever Ltd., Unilever House, London, E.C.4 UNILEVER RESEARCH Dear Sir,\nIn the last issue of \"Felix\"\nthere appeared an article suggesting that l.C. would do well to join\nN.U.S. The authors of that\narticle, Messrs. Bob Finch and\nLes Massey, may be said to be\n\"slightly left of centre\" in their\npolitical outlook; in fact, the\nwhole question of joining N.U.S. is thought of by some as being\njust another \" Socialist stunt.\"\nI have no political connections\nand I am not worried about the\npolitics of N.U.S. Indeed I gather that N.U.S. has been very\nrestrained in expressing any\npolitical opinions in recent years.\nWhat I do know is that N.U.S. campaigns for adequate grants\n~n nd good facilities for students, it\nruns a Student Travel Agency\nand organises Drama Festivals,\nDebating Tournaments and many\nother schemes. It is probably\ntrue that the I.C. Vacation Training Scheme is better than that\nprovided by the N.U.S., but on\nthe other hand N.U.S. provides\nmany services and schemes which\na single college union just cannot\ngive. Not the least of these services are the student concessions\nwhich are available on all sorts of\ngoods from typewriters to tape\nrecorders and from cameras to\ncanoes.\nWhat would be the cost to\nI.C.I The I.C. Union would\nhave to pay nearly \u00a3200 per year\nfor subscriptions plus some conference expenses. Then there\nwould be quite a lot of secretarial\nwork to be done and a post Of\nN.U.S. Secretary would have to\nbe established in I.C. Union.\nIs it worth the trouble ?\nNearly all the other university\nstudents in this country have the\nbenefit of the services of N.U.S. and I think that I.C. students\nshould also be able {without paying 15/- for a separate sub scrip tion) to make the most of these\nservices. If we members of Imperial College want to join\nN.U.S., then it is up to us to\ndecide.\nROY ELLIS.\nDear Sir,\nI have recently been able to\nlook .through and compare the\nnewspapers of a wide variety of\nColleges and Universities. In\nmost cases, it appeared that a large and informed staff produced\nthe many items of news necessary\nfor its survival. Many of them\nwere newspapers in the truest\nsense of the word.\nComparing these with your\npaper, the most immediate difference appears to be the lack of\nactual news which Felix shows.\nThis would seem to be due in part\nto a shortage of staff, and in part\nto a lack of relevant information.\nI submit that were every society\nand club to send to the Editor a complementary ticket to every\nfunction in the college o alen dar, the \" Felix \" (and, incidentally,\nthe clubs concerned), would benefit substantially. This would enable the Editor either to attend\nthe function himself, or to send a member of his staff, thus creating\na closer tie between College and\nnewspaper, and a better and less\njournalistic \" Felix.\"\nYours,\nJ. M. COMBES.\nSir,\nThe last edition of \"Felix\"\ncontains a statement by Mr. H.T. Lovenbury which purports to be\na\" reply \" to an article appearing\nunder our three names in your\nedition of Ylth October. We\nwould like to make some brief\ncomments on this statement.\nApart from being factually inaccurate and misleading, Mr.\nLovenbury's article is almost\ntotally irrelevant to the issues\nraised by us. These centred on\nthe question of the policies pursued by the Exploration Board,\nwhich Mr. Lovenbury's statement\nno more than touches upon. Perhaps it is necessary to state more\nexplicitly some of the points\nwhich require clarification.\n(1) By what criterion does the\nBoard assess the merits of proposals submitted to it, and allocate funds to expeditions ?\n(2) Does the Board accept\ncomplete responsibility for every\nexpedition which it approves ?\n// not, under what circumstances\ndoes it withhold formal approval ?\n(3) The Board annually sets\naside app. \u00a3200 to form a Reserve\nFund, which at present stands at\napp. \u00a3600. Under precisely what\ncircumstances will this fund be\nspent ?\n(4) A more restricted question.\nIn an exposition of the Board's composition and functions published in 1960 it is stated : \" The\nBoard owes its origin to the efforts\nof a small group of students who\nprepared an ambitious scheme for\na climbing expedition in the\nKarakoram during the summer of\n1957.\" Similar schemes were\nproposed to the Board in both\n1961 and 1962. Are mountaineering scientific- expeditions of\nthis nature a thing of the past ?\n// not, when will the Board be in\na position to assist, rather than\nfrustrate, a similar venture ? If\nso, should valuable time be lost\nin attempting to organise an ex-p edition, which at the moment\nseems to fall out of line with the\nsort of project on which the\nBoard \" envisages \" spending its\nreserve fund ?\nMr. Lovenbury cannot be expected to answer these ques-t ions, since, as far as is known,\nhis personal views do not determine the policies of the Exploration Board.\nYours, etc.,\nF. EKMAN\nJ. MURRAY.\nH.D,D. WATSON\n\n"

Ketih Robson held one\nposition during the two months of\nwork, though Tony Stock was\ngiven a greater variety of jobs, all\nwhich he found quite satisfying.\nFrom their first day at the\nworks both were aware of the refreshing lack of resentment towards students by Finnish work-men, a far cry from the at mos BNrreO KINGJHJK Of GREAT SIM\n\u2022 mo mm in ms m so Small Ads.\nFOR SALE1954 Ford Popular\u2014\u00a395.

EXPEDITION TO S TAU NING ALPS EAST GREENLAND It is proposed to organise an\nexpedition to this area during\nthe summer vacation 1963.\nApplications to join the expedition are invited from people\nwith the best combination of\nSurveving, Mountaineering,\nExpedition, Geological or Glaciological experience. Contact\nM.H.K ev via Union Rack or\nInternal 2997\np here that many of us have put\nup with in British industrial\nworks. Indeed, they said, every-one, from operative to manager,\nwent out of their way to be\nhelpful in a factory where there\nwas little if any evidence of a class\nstructure such as exists in plants\nof the same type in many\ncountries.\nThey learned that in some seaport towns (of which Oulu was\none), Swedish is commonly spoken\nwith Finnish relegated to second\nplace. In the student hostel\nwhere they lived some English\nwas spoken thus the language\nbarrier was found not to be too\ngreat an obstacle. Outside the\nhostel, however, the problem of\nmaking oneself understood is\ngreater and the tourist may receive a poor impression of the\ncountry as a result. Both our\nstudents learned a little Finnish,\nalmost to the point of convincing\none young lady that they were\nFinns\u2014but not quite . . . or so\nthey say . . .\nWhen asked what in their\nopinion was the most s tri./\\g physical difference between\nBritish and Finnish towns, the\nreply was instantaneous\u2014\" The\nforests.\" A vast forest encroaching upon the very outskirts of a town is beyond comprehension\nuntil seen personally, and the\nvery sight of it at once makes\nplain the fact that the town to\nFinland is in some way what an\noasis is to the desert. Perhaps the\nunited stand against Nature in her\ntoughest mood has moulded the\nFinnish character into what it is\nto-day \u2014 with hospitality and\nequality well to the fore,\nDuring their two months' work,\nthe local secretary of I. A. E.S.T.E. arranged visits for the students\nliving at the hostel to local factories ; he organised a week's tour of Lapland as well as\nnumerous social functions, all of\nwhich our two students availed\nthemselves, also of the t radi tonal Sauna, or steam bath\u2014usually\ntaken on a Friday evening to be\nfollowed by a meal at a friend's home. The Sauna was in this\ncase owned by the Company.\nAfter two months' paid work\nKeith Robson was able to afford\na holiday of one month in Finl and, some of this time being\nspent by both students as guests\nof the families of friends they\nmade at Oulu, who seemed to\nthink it a matter of course that\nMessrs. Robson and Stock would\nvisit them at their homes, the only\nquestion to solve being that of\nwhen the visit would take place.\nTony Stock eventually made\nthe homeward trip via Denmark\nagain, where he hitch-hiked his\nway to Esbjerg and from there\nwent by sea to Harwich.\nKeith Robson returned to\nEngland by way of Copenhagen,\nmaking the Helsinki-Copenhagen\nstep of the journey by air under\na cheap travel scheme organised\nby S. S.T.S. \u2014the Scandinavian\nStudents' Travel Service.\nFrom the account given by\nthese two men, it was abundantly\nclear that they liked the work, the\nFinns and their land.\nWho will be next, we wonder,\nto follow them and to see Finland\nfor themselves ?\nR.C.S. Court\nA Special Meeting of the R.C.S. Union was held in order to\njudge the sins of the two trophy officers, Dean and Churchill. The\ntwo were accused of being responsible for the disappearance of the\ncollege mascot and rumours were spread that it had been sold to\nGuilds for a considerable sum. The court was held on the steps\nof the Imperial Institute as no one else seemed willing to entertain\nthe Union.\nThe two officers, suitably attired, were first charged with misappropriating service equipment, gross negligence, sleeping on duty,\nbeing drunk and disorderly, and gross immorality. On being accused,\nChurchill pleaded Not Guilty, and Dean, Guilty but Insanitary. A constant bombardment of tomatoes, rice and buckets of water showed\nthe court's disapproval.\nThe President warned the 250\nodd jury that they should listen\ncarefully to the evidence before\nfinding the officers guilty. The\nPresident then called upon Captain S. Adlum to put forward the\ncase for the prosecution. With\ngreat verve Capt. Adlum produced several empty bottles as\nevidence, and called upon impartial witnesses to prove that, on\nthe night, Dean had been drunk,\nand Churchill had been in bed\nwith someone called Flu. He then summed up the evidence and\nasked for the severest penalties,\nand with a final wave of his fez,\ncalled upon the court ot institute\nthe death penalty.\nGeneral Edwards was then\ncalled upon to conduct the case\nfor the defence. He immediately\nbegan by appealing to the reason\nand mercy of the court in this\nmatter, the answering roar showing that he had better appeal for\nhelp. He then presented several\nwitnesses who appeared to have\nbeen bribed by the prosecution,\nand ended with an elegant appeal\nfor the accused.\nAs nobody could hear a word\nof this, it did not appear to make\nmuch difference. After General\nEdwards had finished, the President inquired whether he had\nbeen speaking for or against the\naccused, as he appeared to have\nconvinced everyone of their guilt.\nIt seemed that he had in fact been\nspeaking for the defence, and\nhad done a very successful job\nfor the prosecution. After the\nPresident's very impartial summing up, the Jury was asked for\nits verdict.\n\" Guilty ! \" was the cry. The\nPresident then ordered the exec u tion.\nAfter bombardment with toma-toes, they were washed clean in\nthe Round Pond, several associated members then being forced\nto join them. The President, seeing that he himself was threat-e ned, decided that it was a nice\ntime for a swim, and clam ly stripping off during the Kangella,\nforestalled everyone by diving in.\nThe traffic round South Ken. was then given a preview of\nMorphy Day by a now greatly\nswelled crowd, who marched in\nsingle file across High Street Ken.\nwith great glee.\nH.

Their dress\nwas perhaps inappropriate\u2014one\ncan assume that the \" fez \" had\nnot yet reached London at this\ntime\u2014and it was soon apparent\nthat the Serpentine in winter does\nnot lend itself to shirts and shorts.\nBy 1.15 the party had made its\nway to the centre of the lake, but\na sudden change of wind threatened to take them back to Bayswater. Then a fleet of oarsmen\narrived, and at length, the bitterly\ncold crew arrived on the Kensington shores. Undaunted by\ncries of \" shame,\" \" go home,\"\nand \" try the bridge,\" the party\ngave a cheerful interview to a visiting press reporter.\nAt1.37 p.m., the Law arrived\nand 500 agile I.C. members\nskipped, the fence back to the\npark and relative safety. The\ngallant expeditionary force had\ntheir names taken and await de-velo pm ents. On returning to the\nCollege, the audience, satisfied\nthat Kensington is no longer an\nisland, used their traditional single\nfile tactics on the Zebra crossings\nand entertained some good-natured policemen till 2.30 p.m. The sight of an ITV transmission test card swinging from the\nCollege flagpole at 3 p.m. was\napparently in no way connected\nwith the research of the botanists.\nMembers of * the proposed\nKarakoram expedition might be\ninterested to know that the success\nachieved by ICK I was brought\nabout with neither the financial\nnor the moral support of the\nExploration Board,\nAs a result of pressure, rumoured to have originated at Bow\nStreet, the official November 5th celebrations took place as usual\nat Harlington (it was discovered\nnext day, however, that some students had obviously decided that\nthis was too far away, and had\ngone to Trafalgar Square any-way.)\nThe expectant revellers were\ntransported from the Union bar\nto the Harlington bar by coaches,\nappropriately decorated with the\nplacard \" School Bus.\" Even\nhere, however, these innocents\nfound themselves pursued by the\ntrappings of civilisation, who,\nfortunately removed their helmets\non entering the bar.\nIt is not generally known, nor\nis it significant, at what time the\nbonfire was supposed to be have\nbeen lit, but it can be taken on\ngood authority that it was prematurely ignited.

    "content": "- 4 FELIX PROFILE\nThe Rector\nSir Patrick Linstead first came to Imperial College as an undergraduate in 1922 and went on to postgraduate work in Organic\nChemistry. On obtaining his Ph.D. he joined the staff and was\nsuccessively demonstrator, assistant lecturer, and lecturer. He was\nawarded aD. Sc. in 1930. In 1938 he was appointed Firth Professor\nof Organic Chemistry at Sheffield University and at the outbreak\nof the war was lecturing at Harvard ('probably the best, and certainly the oldest University in America'). He returned to England\nin 1940 to help in the War Effort and joined the Ministry of Supply\nwhere his work was mainly concerned with the Anglo-American\nliaison in scientific matters. He also worked on explosives. After\nthe War, he was appointed Director of Chemical Research for\nD.S.l. R. at Teddington and in 1949 returned to I.C. as Professor\nof Organic Chemistry then to become Dean of R.C.S. in 1953.\nWhen he succeeded Sir Roderick Hill as Rector in 1955 he had\noccupied all the positions in the academic ladder at I.C. with the\nexception of Reader. He was knighted in 1959.\nTwo years before Sir Patrick\nwas made Rector the Government\nannounced that it had decided to\nexpand the college. The Rector\nwas acutely aware of the need for\nStudent amenities in the expansion programme, in particular the\nneed for Halls of Residence. Up to that time the College's policy\nhad been to provide student accommodation in small units by\nconverting single houses, eg. Garden Hall and the old Selkirk Hall.\nSir Patrick did not feel that this\nwas getting to grips with the pro b lem, which he felt should be\ntackled on a big scale. When he\ndiscovered that virtually the\nwhole of Prince's Gardens was\ncoming up for sale he persuaded\nthe University Grants Committee\nto support a scheme for its purchase and development as a student area. There have been\nseveral suggestions as to how the\nnew Halls should be run but the\nRector feels that they should be\ndeveloped on the same lines as the\noriginal I.C. Hostels. In his view\nit would be artificial to copy the\n\" monastic\" Oxbridge system.\nIn addition to Hostel accommodation the Rector is anxious to\nprovide certain sports facilities in\nSouth Kensington. The planned\nsports centre in Prince's Gardens will include squash courts,\na swimming pool and a rifle\nrange. The Rector has recently\napproved plans for a cricket net\non East side. However, while he\nis in favour of certain sports\nfacilities on the new campus, he\nintends to set aside several areas\nwhere there shall be \" green\ngrass for the refreshment of the\nspirit.\"\nTHE CHRISTIAN UNION Warmly invites you to it's meeting\nnext week\nSee your programme cards\nThe expansion of Imperial\nCollege was prompted by the\ncountry's fundamental need for\nmore scientists. Much pressure\nwas put on the college to develop\ninto a vast post graduate in st it u tion, with the exclusion of the\nundergraduate school. The Rector was against this policy and\nwas determined that at least half\nof the college should be comprised of men studying for their\nfirst degrees. On the question of\nextending the undergraduate\ncourse to four years, he feels that\nthis can only be achieved at the\nexpense of numbers and for at\nleast the next ten years the\ncountry's need for scientists must\ntake priority. The College receives more money from the\nD. S.I.R. for research than any\nother university and the Rector is\nproud of the high level of research achieved.\nStaff student relations at a large\nnon-residential college will inevitably leave much to be desired.\nThe Rector hopes that the situation at I.C. will be improved when\nthe College becomes more residential with more staff and many\nmore students living in South\nKensington. There will be more\nopportunity for informal contact\nout of working hours. With regards to his own contact with the\nstudent body the Rector regrets\nthat he has only the time to meet\nthe Union leaders. He can only\nmake typical contacts and not\nstatistical ones, when such large\nnumbers are involved. When the\nexpansion programme is finished\nhe hopes that he will have more\ntime for student contact which\nwill be facilitated by the Halls of\nResidence.\nThe Rector is a firm believer in\ngiving students the maximum of\nfreedom in managing their affairs.\nHe considers that an office of responsibility in a Student Union is\na very important part of a stu-dent's training and he is pleased\nwith the Union's response to this\npolicy. He realises that students\nare young and need an occasional\noutlet for their high spirits but he\ndoes find it rather trying when\nthings get out of hand and the\npolice intervene. The Rector thinks\nthat the students should have more\nregard for the good name of the\nCollege on these occasions. A certain amount of ragging is not\na bad thing so long as it does not\ninterfere with public affairs. He is particularly pleased with the\nannual charity Carnival and considers that it advertises the College very favourably to the residents of Kensington.\nIn addition to his considerable\nduties in the College, Sir Patrick\nalso finds time for many other\nactivities. At present much of his\ntime is spent on the Robbins\nCommittee, which is investigating\nthe whole system of higher education in this country. He is a VicePresident of the Royal (Society\nand also serves as Foreign Secretary to that society, a job that\ngives him plenty of opportunity to\ntravel. When visiting foreign\ncountries the Rector makes a point of visiting art galleries and\nmuseums. He is very interested\nin art (his tastes run to Renaissance rather than Pollock) and\nwas greatly 'honoured when he\nwas recently made a trustee of\nthe National Gallery. He also\nenjoys the theatre but admits to\nhaving only a moderate interest in\nmusic. He has not had much leisure time in the past five years\nbut when the opportunity presents itself he and Lady Linstead\nlike to escape to their country\nhome in the Cotswolds, where\nthey are enthusiastic gardeners.\nThe Rector, however, admits that\nnowadays he is rather lazy with\nrespect to gardening, add prefers\nto relax by taking his pet corgi for\na leisurely walk. He played\ncricket and squash in his younger\ndays and also played golf up to\nthe war, but did not take it up\nagain afterwards.\nIt is difficult to sum up the personality of Sir Patrick Linstead.\nHe has a quiet manner wh eih may\ncreate a first impression of shy-ness, but soon dispels this imp res sion, however, and in his warm*\nhearted conversation displays a young and lively outlook, and a fine sense of humour.

However, there were sufficient present to form the traditional crocodile across the whole length of Putney Bridge.\nGuildsmen mustered in the Mech. Eng. Entrance whilst R.C.S. congregated outside the Chemistry Building, then made their way\nto South Ken and Gloucester Road Stations respectively. At South\nKen., the ticket collector was unable to count above forty-nine,\nresulting in about 250 Guildsmen commandeering a whole train ;\nunfortunately, R.C.S. tried to board the same train at Gloucester\nRoad. One gentleman gained entry only to lose his trousers and be\ndeposited thus attired(?) at Parson's Green.\nIt was decided this year to make an attempt at renewing interest\nin a traditional English game which has declined in popularity\nsacks of\nover the years, namely\nsawdust-collecting thereof.\" The\ntwo teams, the numbers of which\nwere not stipulated, faced each\nother fifty yards apart and after\nthe presidents of each had\nassaulted each other with a shilling cream flan, battle com-men ced.

However, as\nthe battle waged to and fro, under\na constant hail of flour and water\nbombs, seasonal fruit and sods\n(grass variety) the RCS total was\ndepleted through commando\nraids by a few Guildsmen reinforced with a few Minesmen.\nIt was evident that after a few\nminutes that the game had taken\na far more personal nature, for\nmany had found themselves\ntrouser less much to the delight\nof the young ladies present; how-ever, only one gentleman found\nhimself in the river.\nThe game was called to a halt\nafter twenty minutes, Guilds running out winners by five sacks to\nfour.\nAfter a number of final skirmishes attention was fixed on the\nriver, and each crew was supported enthusiastically by members of its College.\nRivalry was soon, forgotten,\nand with the commands from\nJohn White's transistor is ed megaphone ringing in their ears, 450\nstudents in assorted attire (un-dress ?) wandered back across\na convenient Zebra crossing to\nPutney East finally returning to\nIC despite the efforts of Railway\nPolice to repossess the train.\nAs they crossed Putney Bridge\nin the gathering dusk, few will\nforget the sight of a youth clad\nonly in a sweater and his \" St.\nMichels\" making frantic efforts\nto ret rie\" e his trousers which were\nbillowing gently in the autumnal\nbreeze some twenty feet above his\nhead.\nCeremony of the flan sI.C.

It was a chance remark by Michael Bentine on\ntelevision that started the controversy, which, by the week-end, had\nachieved considerable proportions in the area of South Kensington.\nHad, in fact, the Kensington ancestry originated from primaeval\nBayswater by crossing the Serpentine on rafts ? To settle the a rgu ment, a group of second year botanists, headed by Ken Symons,\nconstructed a raft that early settlers might have used had they\nmigrated from the less developed areas of Bayswater. For authenticity, parts were obtained from the decaying Commonwealth Institute\nat the cost of 3/10| to produce the I.C.K I raft.\nAt1.0 p.m., the raft and a primitive telephone (for taking\nsoundings) were finally launched under the watchful eye of a solitary policeman.

A short time later, a coach\nload of followers set off down the same route, smugly passing several\nveterans whose journeys were somewhat shortened this year, only\nto come upon Bo standing at a bus stop in Streatham, with a seized\nup final drive bearing, possibly due to overloading. Since there\nwere only four people on board, it was decided that a prominent\nmember of Guilds was responsible, and it was further proposed\nthat next year's President should either be considerably lighter or\nin the absence of light candidates, a woman should be elected.\nWe left the crew to it and continued on to Brighton, arriving\nat our hotel for lunch some four hours after leaving London. The\ndinner was attended by just over one hundred people, the principal\nguest being none other than Col. Browne who designed Bo some\nsixty years ago.

This just about sums up the\nsport as we experienced it on the river.\nThe Lowry race was rowed over a course of one mile on the\nebbing tide, a tide low enough for there to be little or no advantage\nof one station over another. The stations were: the far bank,\nC.&G.; centre, R.C.S.; and on Surrey, R.S. M. The crews got\naway to a good start, however, the appearance of two schoolboy\ncrews in the path of the race made it necessary for both Guilds'\nand Mines' crews to converge on R.C.S. The resulting fray cut some\nR.C.S. men and broke a Guilds' blade. The launch returned to the\nboat house and collected a spare oar and in due course the crews were\nlined up again for a perfect start. R.C.S. and Guilds went off\nat 35 to Mines' 32. The extra life in the Guilds boat quickly produced a lead of one length which they maintained to Beverley\nBrook where suddenly they\n\" clicked\" and rowing beautifully they took an extra length\nand a quarter. Guilds and R.C.S. both finished at 36 with Mines\ncoming in 3 lengths behind\nR.C.S. at 28.\nThe Morphy race, from Hammersmith to Putney Bridge, a course of If miles, was rowed\nwith practically no help from the\ntide which was due to turn. The\nstations were: the far bank,\nSTAYING IN LONDON but counting your coppers?\nSTOP counting on d JOIN\nTHE LONDON CLUB\nIt offers everything?* Accommodation\n(from 16/6 a night)\n* Luxurious Clubrooms\n\u2022At Excellent restaurants\n(Low priced menus)\n* Congenial Bar*\nit Dances & Film Shows\nir Low cost travel\n(Winter Sports Holidays; Shipping to\nSouth Africa from\n.\u00a338)\nJOIN TODAY! at prices\nyou can afford!\nWrite, phone or call\nfor illustrated\nbrochure!\nTHE\nLITTLE BRITAIN\nCLUB\n26 Courtfield Gardens,\nLondon.

Both\ncox es were repeatedly warned\n(particularly the cox of the C.&G. boat) about their steering.\nThe course of the Mines' crew\nwas unimpeachable. After a good start by all crews, the\nR.C.S. boat was immediately\nsteered into the Guilds' boat\nwhich was about a canvas up at\nthe time. This incident caused\nGuilds to become a little unnerved and their lead was lost.\nBoth crews then proceeded to\nzig-zag for the next mile or so,\naccording to best submarine\navoidance practice, repeatedly\nsteering in front of the Mines'\ncrew which was then about 1|\nlengths down. Up to this point\nno advantage was taken by\nR.C.S. or Guilds. Then happened an incident which may\nwell have been more serious than\nit was. Near Beverley Brook the\nC.&G. cox, forced the R.C.S. boat into a direct line with the\nmoored barges. The resulting\nnecessary manoeuvre by the\nR.C.S. cox caused not only a clash with the Guilds' crew, but\nalso with the side of the barge.\nImmediately the C.&G. crew\ntook a lead of a J length\nand maintained it to the\nfinish. At the finish an appeal\nby R.C.S. was countered by an\nappeal by C.&G. against the\nfoul by R.C.S. at the start. The\nUmpire, Mr.C. A. Bristow, took\nthe best possible action by declaring the race void, ordering a re-row with all three crews starting on level terms. The re-row\nwas over about | mile with the\ntide gently flooding. The start\nby Guilds was brilliant. At a rating of 45 they quickly took a lead of half a length over R.C.S. and one length over Mines' and\nmaintained it to the finish. Even\nin the re-row however the Guilds'\ncox had to be continually warned.\nAll congratulations to the\nGuilds' oarsmen who, despite the\ncox es' efforts, proved their\nsuperiority. The races were\nclose, however, and if the R.C.S. crews had had coaches to drive\nthem just that bit.harder during\ntraining, the results may well have\nbeen reversed. Congratulations\nto Mines too on producing their\nfastest Morphy crew for many\nyears.\nThe talent displayed in these\nMorphy races bodes well for the\nfuture of I.C. rowing. Remember, however, that the I. C.1st Eight does not compete only with\nother college crews, but mainly\nwith crews whose standard is\nWorld Class, rather like the\nRugby 1st Fifteen meeting every\nweek teams like the Springboks.\nFor success, therefore, a very high\nstandard is demanded.\n\u2014 THE RECTOR'S CU PAfter six weeks of term, IC is\nstill without a Boxing Club Committee. Although the three constituent Colleges have been requested to elect Boxing Captains,\nlittle effort has as yet been made\nto form a Rector's Cup Committee.\nAdmittedly few people attend\nthe training sessions, supervised\nby a qualified coach, but surely\nthere is sufficient interest in the\nsport to ensure that the Rector's Cup, which is one of the highlights of the inter-collegiate sports\ncalendar is not jeo pardi sed by the\napathy which at present appears\nall too prevalent ?\nPublished by FELIX BOARD.

    "content": "SQUASH\nAt10.30 a.m. on Saturday.\n27th October, two teams of\nsquash players, plus appropriate\nsupport, set off from I.C. for a co-ordinated attack on four Cambridge Colleges. Our match\nsecretary had a thoroughly organised programme of matches\nplanned, even down to the details\nof the pubs which should be\nvisited, and when. He had exceeded himself, however, by put-ing one team against Christ College and the other against Corpus\nChristi. I knew from the start\nthat this would be too much for\nme, and had taken the precaution\nof including in my car a certain\nDavid Anderson, former Cambridge agent, who sought academic asylum in London last Octobre. Despite this, we managed to\nget half the second team to each\nof the two colleges, while the two\ncars full of the first team played\n\" follow-my-leader\" round the\none-way streets of Cambridge.\nDistances are small in these provincial towns, however, and we\nsoon sorted ourselves out.\nFor the Squash after lunch, the\n1stV fielded a varied collection\nof players. As first string, IC\ncan now boast possession of an\nEgyptian international player,\nSherif Afifi, who was ably supported by Robin Creed, whose\nhonours include playing for his\ncounty, and as first string for his\nformer university. At No.3, Eric\nBurnett from Rhodesia came on\nthe court, breathing fire and determination to make up for the\nlack of fighting spirit he detects\nin British players. Fourth string\nwas Michael Combes, wielding\nwhat was once described as the\nperfect gamesmanship technique\nof playing three shots to his opp o net's one during the knock-up.\nBringing up the rear was the captain whose chief claim io notoriety is an obstinate refusal\nto run more than six inches in\nsearch of a ball. (Or so the rest\nof the team will tell you.)\nAll the matches were won, and\nwe embarked on the evening's festivities well pleased with our-selves. In the meantime, the\nsecond team had lost to Corpus\nChristi but were all set to make\na come-back the following day.\nIt is believed that all the players\nfound some obscure corner in\nwhich to rest for at least a few\nhours during the night. At any\nrate, all were in good enough\nhealth by Sunday afternoon to\nacquit themselves honour ably on\nthe courts. The first team beat\nQueen's College 4\u20141, and the\nsecond team lost by match to St.\nJohn's College.\nI.C. Christian Union\nWhat think ye\nof\nChrist\nFELIX\nHOCKEY Although the Club now boasts nearly seventy playing members\nwho have shown sufficient enthusiasm to warrant the formation of\na fifth eleven, five weeks have passed without success; the difficulties\nbeing no home pitch and a number of'people who will not tick\noff before Friday evening.\nIn spits of these setbacks, which last throughout the season, the\ntrials revealed considerable talent\u2014always useful for mixed hockey,\nso although there were no outstanding players, there should be some\nstrong sides in the club. With more than half of last year's1st eleven\nstill playing, success should come\nwith practice, if we can learn to vers it y Cup, but fortunately we\nsettle down during a game. The survived to fight again, with a re-7 -Cup team should benefit from a player in the University side, and\na player-coach who has International honours. But the forward line must learn to shoot\nonce they reach the circle.\nTwelve goals in eight games and\nsix against one side, is too con-clu sive. The first eleven have had only\na few creditable performances;\nthe first match of the season\nagainst Centymca, when we lost\n2\u20140, to a team of Indians who\nwere better individuals than our-selves. The next Saturday match\nagainst a strong West Essex side\nresulted in a1 \u20141 draw with\nPhillips scoring our only goal.\nThe latest failure last Wednesday\nwas in the first round of the Uniplay in a fortnight's time.\nSurprisingly it was the fresher s who wilted under the physical\nstrain of those games, so training has been arranged, at their in-convenience, every Monday and\nThursday lunchtime, meeting in\nthe gym. Of course all members\nof the first and second elevens will\nattend.\nAt the beginning of term, more\nthan fifty fresher s signed the list\nof prospective members, but\nnearly twenty of them have yet to\ngo near a hockey pitch this sea-son. Should they, or anybody\nelse wish to play hockey at all\nthis season, please contact me\nthrough the Union rack, or in\nroom 34, Old Hostel.\nJOHN SKINNER( Capt.).\nSWIMMING In the away fixture with Kings\nlast Tuesday, IC just managed to\nsnatch a draw in the swimming\nmatch by winning both relays.\nTo have done this against the\nstrongest London College after\nfailing to win the individual events\nwas a very commendable effort\nand the fighting spirit of the team\nwas very noticeable. The Water\nPolo was a bit more one-sided for\nafter an opening goal by King's,IC quickly picked up, winning by\nsix goals to two. Scorers for IC\nwere Clark (2), Collins (2), C. Davis and J. Davis.\nAfter four matches this season,\nthe first team remains undefeated\nin both swimming and polo, while\nthe second team (has only lost\nonce, to UC1 st team by a narrow\nmargin. Both these teams will be\nentered in the University Handicap Knock-out Water Polo Competition on the 27th of this month\nand it is hoped that one of them\nwill retain the trophy which has\nbeen held by IC twice in the past\nthree years.\nA full team has also been entered in the University Swimming\nChampionships at UL U, the finals\nof which take place this evening\n(14th Nov.). IC are the holders\nof this trophy at the moment, and\nstand a good chance of retaining\nit for a further twelve months.\nAll supporters are very welcome at either of these events and\nat all other matches.\nN.B. \u2014 IC SWIMMING GALE, NOVEMBER30 th,8 p.m. MARSHALL STREET BATHS, SOCCER\nThe University League Programme is in full swing. The 2nd XI leads its Division, the 5th XI is very strongly placed, whilst the\n6th and 7thX I's are also leaders\nof their respective leagues. Al though beating I.C.3 rd XI, the\n4th' s do not seem to have found\ntheir form; and the 1st XI is in\nserious trouble. After being\nbeaten twice by Northampton\nCollege, they have scraped only\none point from three games. The\n9th XI has had two successful\ngames but it is proving exceedingly difficult to find fixtures.\nChoosing at random from the\nlast two weeks, a trip to Cambridge is recalled. The minute\ndimensions of Christ's College\npitch at first perplexed I.C.l st's who started off in a rather shaky\nmanner. However, the team\nsoon settled down but the goals\nwere very slow in coming, and it\nwas the wing-halves who took the\ninitiative. A series of cunning\nlobs managed to elude the goalkeeper and four more from the\nforwards brought the total to\neight.\nResult: WON8 \u20141.\nSAILING\nThe club was established in\n1948 and grew slowly until to-day\nit is one of the strongest in the\nUniversity of London. The club\nowns six 12ft.\" National Firefly \"\ndinghies and sails at the Welsh\nHarp, Neasden, an excellent\nstretch of sailing water. The club\nis very lucky to be able to sail\nhere.\nThe club has in the past had\nseveral figures well known in the\nsailing world, John Conway-Jones\nand Graham Taylor among them,\nboth of them scoring high in the\nnational championships in their\ntimes. At present the club has\nslightly declined because of the\nlack of good fresher s, but it still\nhas a high standing in the University of London. It has a good\nname for keeping its boats in excellent order and for the high\nstandard of its members, four of\nwhom sail regularly for U.L. teams.\nDavid Pentz, the commodore,\ncomes from the Solent area, the\ntraditional home of sailing, and\nhas many years' experience, firstly\nin Cadets and then in Fireflies,\nbehind him. He maintains a good example in his leadership of\nthe club and has been instrumental in the latest expansion to\nsix boats. Vice-commodore John\nKlaschka captains the second\nteam and looks after the cli tb's racing interests. He and Hon.\nSec. Basil Alsopp developed the\ninstruction scheme to its present\nstrength, when twenty people are\ninstructed each Wednesday.\nAndrew Thomson, Treasurer,\ncame to L.C. with a good record\nin Merlin dinghies, and has been\ndeveloping well in his first year,\nnow being an excellent 2nd team\nmember. He has also sailed for\nthe University 2nd team.\nThe executive is well supported by a hard working com-mitte e, amongst whom are Stevie\nVines, organiser of the Easter\nEast Coast cruise, Eric Twiname,\nand Penny Howard, the U.L. Ladies team captain.\nThis year the club has had a good intake of fresher s and is\nthriving. Many of the new members are showing great enthusiasm, so that we can look forward\nto a good year of sailing.\nDEBATE I.
