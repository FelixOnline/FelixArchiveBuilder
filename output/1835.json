    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n6 | sCIENCE 24 November 2023\nA\nrecent study by Imperial\u2019s Dr Robin Lamboll\nshocked the climate-science community and captivated the media, landing a spot on the front page\nof BBC News. This week, Felix sat down with Lamboll,\nResearch Fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate\nChange, to delve further into the details of\nthe research.\nA recap of the study\n\u201cThe study looks at the remaining carbon,\nthe amount we can emit before we exceed\na certain temperature with a certain\nprobability\u201d, Lamboll explained. \u201cThe\ninternational community agreed that we\nshould try to be below 1.5\u00b0C and well below\n2\u00b0C. For 1.5\u00b0C, the remaining carbon budget is really\nvery small, approximately equal to six years of current\nemissions, and now that\u2019s nearly down to five years\u201d.\nLamboll\u2019s work made important adjustments to\nthe method used in calculating the remaining carbon\nbudget, which effectively shrank the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change\u2019s prediction by half.\n\u201cThe main part of that update was us now\nunderstanding that aerosols are cooling us slightly\nmore than we thought.\u201d Aerosols are tiny particles in\nthe atmosphere, released by processes like combustion.\n\u201cOne effect is that they change how clouds form. You\u2019ve\ngot all this particulate matter in the air, and they form\nnucleation sites, so aerosols can be a form of seeding for\nclouds.\u201d Clouds reduce the amount of sunlight reaching\nto the Earth\u2019s surface by reflecting it. However, the\nreduction in use of fossil fuels means fewer aerosols are\nemitted, and therefore worsening the global climate.\nTackling the challenges\nof climate science\nLamboll\u2019s study, published in Nature Climate Change,\nexplored the uncertainties that overshadow climate sci-ence. \u201cWe have to use a collection of social models and\ntry to include all of these different types of uncertain-ty, which are along very different axes. With the social\nuncertainty, the problem becomes that they\u2019re not necessarily symmetric so there\u2019s much more chance that\nyou\u2019re going to be hotter than the expected value. We\nuse something called a generalized extreme value fitting.\u201d\nAnother uncertainty arises when considering the\ntiming of net zero. \u201cYou can get to net zero by several\ndifferent routes. The sooner you start reducing\nemissions, the longer you have to get to net zero, but if\nyou were going to do it linearly starting at the beginning of\nthis year, which clearly we didn\u2019t, you\u2019d have 12 years to get\nthere.\u201dDespitethis,Lambollremainssomewhatoptimistic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to bear in mind that the climate can\npredispose you towards worse disasters, but humans\nalmost always have opportunities to mitigate against\nthat.\u201d\nPolitical and economic factors determine the world\u2019s\nresponses to climate research, as Lamboll elaborated:\n\u201cGovernmentplansforreachingnetzeroby2050exist.\nThere are still some question marks over bits of it, but we\nprobably won\u2019t be very far off in this country.\nBy contrast with the rest of the world, there\nare quite large fractions that have no net-zero\nplans for before 2060.\n\u201cThe capacity to change obviously scales\nwith the amount of money you have to bring\nabout that change. We need to rely on international agreements.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the really big problems with\nmovement in the climate [policy] space is that\nit requires consistent action over a long period to motivate those social changes and those technological changes that bring about a greener world, but politicians work\non very short timescales and therefore find it very difficult to set up systems that are going to deliver over those\nlong timescales\u201d.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWhen asked about his future research, Lamboll\nexplained: \u201cSome projects include looking at carbon\ndebt, which is how much we have emitted in different\ncountries relative to what our fair budget would be.\nAnother project is trying to get absolute probabilities\nof climate impacts because we require those social and\nphysics predictions\u201d.\nAssessing the climate crisis\nwith Dr Robin Lamboll\nSCIENCE\nScienceWriter\nEMILY WENTWORTH\nFelix talks with\nImperial\u2019s Dr Robin\nLamboll to discuss\nour remaining carbon\nbudget.\nDr Robin Lamboll, Imperial College Research Fellow at the Centre\nfor Environmental Policy. Imperial College London\nRead more in Issue 1833:\nFor 1.5\u00b0C, the remaining carbon budget\nis very small, approximately equal to\nsix years of current emissions, and\nnow that\u2019s nearly down to five years.\n\u201c\n\n"

This\nnew service allows governments, NGOs\nand members of the public to pay money in order to remove an equal amount of\nmoney from a charity of choice.\nResearcher Feb Senton who led the\nproject told assembled journalists at a\npress conference that \u201cThe main aim\nof this research is to drive innovation\nin the charity sector. For too long,\ndo-gooders have had a monopoly on\ncharitable donations which has been\nvery unfriendly to large parts of the\nmisanthrope community\u201d. He went on to\nexpress hope that this would open up the\nfield to disruptors.\nThe announcement has been met\nwith dismay by Big Charity. Oxfam\nHead of Guilt Tripping Colando Rharles\ntold NegaFelix, \u201cThis totally upsets our\nindustry.

He discusses the\nbook The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the\nAir by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, the 19th-cen-tury philosopher, which denotes some\ntraits that we must follow to create mean-ing, starting with silence, obedience and\njoy. Stephen states that, in our daily lives,\nwe are constantly immersed in noise.\nOn our commute, at work, at university,\nand at home, there is always some sort\nof background chatter, and not just in\nthe literal sense. We are often distracted\nby our phones and by our to-do lists, and\nalways concerned about the next task, as-signment, or promotion. But somewhere\nbeyond this realm of habitual concern is\nthe opposite of thinking: silence.\nThis week\u2019s theme was intended to\ncapture a moment of that precious, rare\nsilence. But what does the city have to do\nwith it? I believe there is some nuance\nto this \u2018city silence\u2019 combination. Yes,\nsilence implies the absence of commu-nication, but it also help us listen to our\nenvironment, enter into communion\nwith other creatures, people, and shared\nspaces, such as a city. In this sense, \u2018city\nsilence\u2019 is both an egocentric and ego-less concept.\nLet us come back to photography.\nCallum represents this silence in an incredibly eloquent manner. High Street\nKensington is a very touristy and extremely busy area in London, and we always expect people to buzz around the\nmain tube station moving to and fro.\nThis photo, however, captures a singular\nmoment when all is silent, the trains are\nrunning but nobody is on them. It gives\nus a moment of pause from the noise of\nrush hour and the time to understand\nour own internal silence that can only\nbe acknowledged by simply looking, and\nnot thinking nor acting.\nLuckily for us, Callum has sacrificed\ntheir own moment of silent reflection to\ntake this picture and show us this scene.\nThe banality of it hits us, in the same way\nthat a completely silent room, or utterly\ndeserted field does. We feel both a part of\nthe empty city scene and completely abstracted from it, just like the \u2018city silence\u2019\ntheme suggests, our ego simply existing\namidst the silence.\nThis week take a nice deep breath and\ndon\u2019t think too hard. Don\u2019t even think\nabout this photo, just look.\nCity Silence\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nWhen was the last time you did absolutely nothing?\nScan the QR code to\nsubmit for the next theme\n\u2018Accidental Renaissance\u2018:\nUrban Oxymoron Callum Marshall\n\n"

When\nthe acclaimed author Athena Liu\ndies in her apartment, a friend from\ncollege, June, is right there with her.\nJune steals her late friend\u2019s manuscript,\nand publishes it under her own name.\nIt propels her from flop to bestseller,\na writer sailing at Icarian heights of\nsuccess. What comes after, however, is\na series of intrigues: June attempts to\ncover up her theft, and faces challenges\nin the literary industry, all while trying\nto find her next hit story.\nPraised by The Sunday Times, Time\nmagazine, and the horror writer Stephen\nKing himself, Yellowface has made waves\nfar beyond Kuang\u2019s loyal readership,\ncapturing the attention of thousands of\nreaders worldwide.\nThe novel tells the tale of a once-friendly\nrivalry turned vitriolic, exposing\nthe unholy methods used to progress\nin the merciless publishing industry.\nThe nimble pace of narration makes\nYellowface a quick and enjoyable read.\nKuang uses her deft prose and an original\nplotline to highlight racism, tokenisation\nof minority writers, and the prevalent\ndog-eat-dog culture in the industry. This\nsardonic portrayal of the literary \u2018road\nto the top\u2019 possesses a certain sense of\ncharming irony, as it seems almost like\nKuang is describing Yellowface\u2019s path: are\nthese signs of a bestseller in the making?\nBut where it tries to incorporate\nelements of the thriller genre, it\nfails in its prose to cast a gripping\nnarrative. Scenes intended as\nsuspenseful fail to deliver their\npromised punch, and as a consequence,\nthey instead come across as rather\nunsatisfactory.\nAnd sometimes, Kuang\u2019s criticism\nof the literary publishing industry is so\nexplicitly voiced that the writer may as\nwell be holding a sign with big, flashing\narrows saying: \u2018For an account of\neverything wrong with the publishing\nindustry, read on!\u2019\nIt never particularly feels that the\nnarrator is one step ahead of the reader.\nIndeed, some plot lines are so evidently\nplanted and left unfinished in the\nfirst two-thirds of the book that their\nultimate entanglement can be seen\nfrom miles away, dissolving any tension\nbefore it is allowed to precipitate in the\nfirst place.\nIn June, Kuang conjures an extremely\nself-righteous protagonist who is hard\nto sympathise with. Though easily\ndigestible and entertaining to read, her\ninner monologues feel childish and\npetty. The reader is thus confronted\nby a narrator, whose character flaws\nmercilessly strip away any account of\ncredibility.\nAll things considered, Yellowface\npresents a clever and facetious take\non the publishing industry\u2019s faults\nthat expose its deep-rooted, systemic\nfailings. The novel\u2019s thriller elements\nfeel somewhat out of place, noticeably\nengineered to come together at the end.\nHowever, when they do arise, it is worth\nthe thrills. Yellowface is a fun, quick read,\nthough suffering from an episodic lack\nof subtlety.\nYellowface by R. F. Kuang hits the\nmark, sometimes\nBOOKS\nBook Club\u2019s\nNovember pick:\na witty take on\nthe failings of an\nindustry.\nBooksWriter\nDELIA GINCU\nFor an account of\neverything wrong\nwith the publishing\nindustry, read on!\n\u201c\nHarperCollins\n\n"

This makes\nno sense at the surface level:\nwhy would you make something built to fall apart? As with\nmany seemingly irrational commercial decisions, this can be\nexplained by money. Companies can turn huge profits from\ncheap, non-durable products\nthat need to be replaced fre-quently. This is highly resource\ninefficient, and creates unnecessary excess waste, much of\nwhich ends up in landfills long\nbefore it needs to.\nA prime example of planned\nobsolescence sheer nylon stock-ings. In the 1940s, the women\u2019s\ngarment industry realised the\npotential to make more money by selling more of these at\ncheaper prices. This led to a\nredesign of previously robust,\ngood quality stockings to incorporate a \u2018laddering\u2019 issue, that\ncreates holes and permanently\ndisfigures them. Typically, the\ncheap, thin stockings produced\nby most major clothing manufacturers today only fulfil their\npurpose well for two or three\nwears before breaking, which\nmeans customers have to frequently purchase new sets of\nthese stockings.\nApple\u2019s iPhone is another\nproduct that has been designed\nto swiftly become obsolete. Anyone who has owned an iPhone\nwill have noticed that every\ntime the tech company builds\nup to the release of new mod-els, their older phones start to\nwork slower and run out of battery more quickly. These issues,\ntermed Batterygate, have been\ntheorised to be built into Apple\u2019s\nsoftware updates to incentiv-ise customers to buy the latest\nphone.\nApple is also currently under\ninvestigation by French advocacy group Stop Planned Obsolescence (HOP) for their practice of\npairing, in which components\nare linked to specific devices\nthrough their serial number.\nThis means that devices can\nrecognise unregistered components and potentially be less\ncompatible with them, which\ndisincentivises their customers from repairing their\nphones in favour of\nbuying a new one.\nHOP claims that\nthis goes against\nthe EU\u2019s \u2018right-torepair\u2019 legislation,\nwhich requires\nmanufacturers to\nmake repair-and-mainte-nance information available\nto consumers and third-party\nrepair services.\nIn many such cases, eventual obsolescence is so ingrained\nin product design that the consumer can do little to prevent\nit, and only recently have\nbrands started to revert back to the qual-ity-over-quantity ap-proach.\nI recently had the\npleasure of chatting\nwith Laura Harnett,\nthe founder of Seep,\na brand looking to re-inventcleaningprod-ucts to make them\nmore durable, longer\nlasting, and less toxic\nto the environment\nthan similar conventional products.\nHarnett noted a gap\nin the market for\neco-friendly sponges,\nin which other products such as cleaning\ndetergents have established alternatives like Ecover. Conventional sponges are\nmade primarily of polyester and\npolyurethane, with an adhesive\nin between \u2013 these are worn\ndown extremely quickly, and\nresult in lots of microplastics\nreleased down our drains and\ninto our waterways. Seep aims\nto combat this by using only recycled or natural materials; for\nexample, their sponge is made\nfrom recycled cellulose wood\npulp and loofah plant fibres,\nwith cotton thread to secure\nthe spongey and scouring sides\ntogeth-er. Seep\nis not the\nonly company making their\nmark in this fashion, but unfortunately breaking into existing markets as an eco-friendly\nalternative more often\nthan not means losing\nmoney or making a\nmuch lower profit margin at the\noutset.\nPerceived obsolescence is\nmulti-faceted, encompassing\nthe view of products as only\nbeing useful or valuable when\nin good condition, as well as\ntying in the effect of trends on\nconsumption. At some point\nwe have all experienced the\ntargeted advertising that says\nyou must have the latest shoes,\nmake-up, television or celebrity\ncollaboration from your favourite brand.\nTrends are one of the greatest\nbarriers to reducing consump-tion; we are heavily influenced\nby both our friends and\nrole models to wear or\nuse particular products,\nand owning items that\nare in fashion or from\niconic brands has long\nbeen seen as a symbol of wealth and sta-tus. New isn\u2019t always\nbetter either; your\nthree-year-old pair\nof sneakers is likely to be much more\ncomfortable than\nthe trendy fresh\npair you just bought\n\u2013 and until they\nstart to literally\nfall apart, they\u2019re\nlikely to be equally as functional as\nwhen they were\nbrand new \u2013 yet there is\na satisfaction and self-esteem\nthat comes with making that\npurchase.\nOne could even draw a link\nbetween perceived obsolescence and food waste, although this leads into a whole\nother discussion topic, and\none that I won\u2019t spend too\nmany words on here.\nSo many food items\nremain edible long\nafter their stated expiration or use-by\ndate, with the exception of products such\nas milk, but it is much\neasier to avoid food poisoning\nby sticking to the date than by\nmaking your own judgement.\nTo effectively move towards\na world in which our consumption is reduced and all our waste\ncan be reused or recycled, a wide\nbehavioural change is needed on the part of consumers.\nBut, more importantly, producers need to be driven to design\nproducts that can be recycled,\nand one approach to this is the\npolicy of \u2018extended producer\nresponsibility\u2019 (EPR), which extends the responsibility of producers to post-consumer prod-ucts, so that they must manage\ntheir disposal at the end of their\nlifetime.\nAnother good practice is to\nencourage manufacturers to\nmake goods in a modular way,\nso they can easily be replaced\nor mended when they fail; this\nis already done by Rolls Royce,\nwho own all their engines, even\nthose in use. This follows the\nEPR policy, while incorporating\nease of maintenance and replacement for engines nearing\nthe end of their life.\nFurthermore, these concepts\nlink to the potential for creating\na \u2018shared economy\u2019, in which a\nwider variety of goods are treated as services that can be used\nby different people. An example of this is Circos, a children\u2019s\nclothing company that offers\nbaby clothes for rent, since most\nare only worn a few times before\nthe child grows out of them.\nAs it is, the market incentives\nof capitalism and consumerism\nare nuanced, and not in favour\nof creating an environmentally sound economy. This might\nseem pessimistic, because the\nforemost drivers of change to\neconomic structure, sadly, are\nnot environmental lobbyists.\nHowever, what such a dire scenario indicates is that there\nare plenty of avenues for such\ngroups to form, and to advocate\nfor and put into place the incentive structures that produce positive impacts. This is not a case\nof saturation, but one of infinite\nopportunity for a meaningful\ntransition towards a sustainable\nfuture.\nare linked to specific devices\nthrough their serial number.\nThis means that devices can\nrecognise unregistered components and potentially be less\ncompatible with them, which\ndisincentivises their customers from repairing their\nphones in favour of\nbuying a new one.\nHOP claims that\nthis goes against\nthe EU\u2019s \u2018right-torepair\u2019 legislation,\nwhich requires\nmanufacturers to\nmake repair-and-mainte-nance information available\nto consumers and third-party\ninto our waterways.

We\nlook to these institutions to foster intellectual\ndiversity; we trust them with the mission of making our\nworld a more equitable place. However, there is a stark\ndifference between their rhetoric and their actions.\nIn a decisive move against the right to freedom of\nexpression, the police arrested 20 students at Brown\nUniversity, in Providence, US, for protesting for an\nimmediate ceasefire to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\nLast Wednesday, the advocacy group \u2018BrownU Jews\nfor Ceasefire Now\u2019 staged a peaceful sit-in protest on\ncampus. Its message was clear, with its statement\nreading: \u2018In light of the ongoing genocide occurring\nin Gaza backed by American aid, weapons, media,\npoliticians, and academic institutions, we, BrownU Jews\nfor Ceasefire Now, call on Brown University to do its part\nto promote an immediate ceasefire and a lasting peace\nby divesting its endowment from companies that enable\nwar crimes in Gaza.\u2019\nThis is far from an isolated case \u2013 pro-Palestinian\nstudents have been consistently shunned by the\nuniversity\u2019s media. The pro-Palestinian movement is\nuniversally being painted as anti-Semitic; however,\nthis accusation could not be further from the truth \u2013 as\nAriela Rosenzweig, a researcher at Brown, explained,\nupon being interviewed by the Boston Globe. \u201cAs Jewish\nstudents, we\u2019ve had enough of our university co-opt-ing our identities to justify maintaining financial ties\nto an apartheid state and suppressing advocacy for\nPalestinian liberation.\u201d\nIn response to the protest, the local police forcibly\nremoved them from campus. Despite being part\nof a university that seeks to \u2018elevate voices across\ncampus through a culture of questioning and active\nparticipation\u2019, as it claims to on its Admissions page,\nthese students were met with unwavering hostility. This\nis just the most recent addition to a list of incidents in\nwhich student voices have been silenced.\nBut why should this matter to you, a student at\nImperial? Together, with scholars from all around the\nworld, we form a tight-knit community. We are the\nthinkers and leaders of tomorrow \u2013 yet, people such as\nus have had their rights stripped away by those they\ntrusted most. Even as you are reading this, student\nvoices are being suppressed. The right to freedom of\nexpression cannot be applied selectively; everyone must\nhave the right to express their beliefs, and we must\nstand in solidarity with those who cannot.\nWhen interviewed by the non-profit newsroom Prism\nReports, Stephen Hamad, a student representative of\nthe group \u2018Students for Justice in Palestine\u2019 at George\nWashington University, commented that \u201cthere\u2019s\nparticularly a reason why they focus so much of this\nrepression on the student movement. And that in our\neyes is because they understand the student movement\nis being a significant material threat [to the oppressor\u2019s narrative.]\u201d Referring to the \u201cscare tactics\u201d used by\ninstitutions, Hamad continued by saying that instead of\nrelying on US institutions, they, \u201cfind safety in the fabric\nof mutual care and in the fabric of community-centred\nand collective action\u201d.\nImperial is a diverse community.

Sen told Felix that\nhe was very sorry for his remarks, calling them \u201ca lapse\nfor which I sincerely apologise and regret.\u201d\nHe launched into the anti-Semitic tirade after a Dr\nBenjamin Zachariah questioned his sobriety.\n\u2018Hope they hound you out from wherever you are Jewboy,\u2019 he told Zachariah, before using a slogan adopted by\nthe Nazi-era newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer as its motto. During World War II, Der St\u00fcrmer regularly published articles calling for the genocide of the \u2018Jewish race\u2019.\nIn an email to Felix this Monday, Sen wrote:\n\u2018I had entered into an altercation with someone I\nknew who happened to be a Jew and whose family has\nbeen well known to me for thirty years. This altercation\nhad nothing whatsoever to do with the current Middle\nEast conflict or Jews in general. Indeed I count Jewish\npeople as my close friends.\u2019\n\u2018The anti-Semitic words I used were directed against\none individual (whom I shall not name) who insulted\nme online in public.

For\navid Food&Travel section readers, the previous\nissue revealed my distaste for British bread and love for\nthe German sort, as well as how I bring my own mixes\nfrom home. My friend always returns with mountains\nof cheese rarely found in London\u2019s many foreign grocery\nstores, hence I became curious and set out to gather\nsome data about the types of food eaten by international\nstudents.\nWhat does London not provide?\nTen students completed the survey sent out last week\nabout food from their cultures. Surprisingly enough,\nthe most common answer was not a meal such as\npasta; it was spices. Specifically, eight spices: sumac,\nturmeric, garam masala, red chili powder, cumin\nseeds, Kashmiri chilli from India, pepper, mitmita\nfrom Eritrea, as well as seaweed seasoning from Hong\nKong. Two people mentioned olive oil, of which one\nalso wrote that they brought zaatar, a herb from the\nMiddle East.\nNoodles, chocolate, and bacon\nAmong the submissions were Moroccan dumplings called briouate, bread, sausages, hams, Polish\nkabanosy, instant noodles by companies such as Maggi, lentils, and curry cubes. Obviously, no fresh or\neasily spoiled items were mentioned. As for snacks,\nthere were mostly nuts, raisins, dried fruits, an Indian dessert called kaju katli, pepernoten from the\nNetherlands, and chocolate bonbons called Sonho de\nValsa from Brazil. Reading all of these submissions\ngave a nice understanding of the food missing in London, but also the specialties of each country. Italian\nsmoked bacon must be pretty good for it to be worth\nflying home, as one student did. The same applies to\nany frozen food, such as the stuffed grape leaves mentioned by an Omani Lebanese student and Moroccan\nsweet pastilla.\nThere is no place like home\nBesides the food, one student brought a rice cooker from\nHong Kong. Having bought a rice cooker (which was anything but) in the Netherlands myself, I understand that\ncountries that eat rice every day will develop the best\ntools for their cuisine. Another thing: cheese from Italy.\nOne student brings grana padano parmesan, which can\nbe found in the UK under the same name, but probably\nnot with the same taste.\nIn a city as international as London, it becomes easy\nto find a couple of places that represent your culture.\nHowever, whereas a restaurant might claim to be\nauthentic to a cuisine, it does not take long to doubt\nthe authenticity. Take Winter Wonderland. Last year,\nI went to the spectacle that is Hyde Park\u2019s winter pride\nand found myself disappointed by the German food\nthey claimed to serve. K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle, a unique cheese\ndish in southern Germany and Austria, was served\nas a common mac-and-cheese plate. It is completely\nunderstandable if an entreprise cannot find the correct ingredients in the UK \u2013 something which many\ninternational restaurants struggle with \u2013 however there\nis a difference, for instance, between pho and noodle\nsoup. I think many readers might find such moments\nfamiliar. You not only taste the difference on your buds,\nbut feel the difference in your heart.\nCustoms versus food\nAlthough my initial reaction to the survey often\nincluded the words \u201ccustoms\u201d and \u201chow?\u201d, it was clear\nin the research that meat and diary from the EU are\nallowed to pass through customs. Only non-EU countries are banned from bringing any animal-related\nfood through the border. I do hope to hear more stories\nabout what students prioritise when packing food from\ntheir home country. Now, I hope my friend does not get\ncaught, because her cheese does not have the visa to\nenter the UK.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u001d\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001c\n\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u001c\u0017\u0018\u001a\u001e\u001d\u0019\u0018\u001c\n\u0012\u001d\u0011\u0017\u001e\u0010\u0011\u000f\u001c\nFOOD&TRAVEL\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001e\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001c\u001a\u0015\u0014\u0019\u0018\u001b\nIf it is as small as a pack\nof spices or as large as\na kilogram of bacon, it\nwill travel from all over\nthe world into London.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001b\u0018\u001a\u0017\u001d\u001c\u0016\u001d\u0015\u0014\u001a\u001d\u0013\u0012\u0019\u001b\u001a\u0011\u001d\u0010\u000f\u0015\u000f\u001d \u000e\u0014\u000f\u0019 \u001c\u0015\u0015\u001a\u001d \u0019\u001c \u0013\u0015\u001a \u001d \u001d \u0019\u000f\u001b\u001a \u001d\b\u0010\u0018\u0015\u001c\u0019\n\u001f\u001d\u0013\u0012\u0018\u0015\u0007\u000f\u0013\u001a\u001d\u0017\u0018\u0015\u0014\u001d\u0016\u001c\u001c\u0010\u001d\u0018\u001e\u001d\u0018\u0015 \u0006\u0012 \u0011\u001d\u0005\u0011\u0010\u0016\u001c\u0019\u0010\u001d \u001d\u0004\u001a \u0018\u0003\u001d\u0002 \u0012\u0013\u0015\u0019\u000f\u0015\u001c\u0019\n\u000e\u0018\u001c \u000f\u0019\u001d\u0001\u001c\u0015\u001d\u000e\u0014\u001c\u0007\u001c \u000f\u0015\u001a\u001d\n\u0010\u001a \u0018\u0007\u000f\u0015\u001a\u007f\u007f\u000f\u0081\u0007\u001c\u0081\u0012\u008d\n\u008f\u0019\u000f\u001e\u000f\u001d \u000f\u0010\u000f\u001e\u001c\u001d\n\u0013\u001c\u0090\u001a\u0019\u0013\u001a\u0015\u0016\u001c\u001c\u0010\u0018\u001a\u0081\u0007\u001c\u0090\n\u009d\u000f \u0018\u001d\u009d\u000f\u0013\u000f \u000f\u001d\u00ad\u001c\u001c\u0010 \u001a\u0013\n\u000f\u0090\u000f\u007f\u001c\u001e\u0081\u0007\u001c\u0081\u0012\u008d\n\u009d\u0018\u0015\u0090\u0018\u0015\u000f\u001d\b\u0015\u0014\u001c\u0080\u0018\u000f\u001e\u001d\u0082\u0080\u0018\u0007\u001a\u001d\n\u001a\u0015\u0013\u0011\u0081\u0007\u001c\u0090\n\n"

A difficult play,\nBen Meacher and Manu Greenfield as Vladimir and Estregon led the play with panache and seemed to have a\ngood chemistry with one another. In difficult roles they\nperformed well and confidently. They could, however,\nhave benefited from picking up on their cues faster and\nincreasing the variety of the pacing they used in their\nlines as some sections felt monotonous and unnatural.\nThere were moments of highly polished dialogue when\nall actors ran on oiled wheels and lines flowed smoothly\nfrom one to the next. However, it was hard not to notice\nthe moving back and forth between the practised and\nless practiced sections of the play. On the less positive\nside, engaging with the audience was an idea that should\nhave been left in the rehearsal room. The play already\nhas humorous sections but mugging to the audience\nonly served to undermine the more serious sections of\nthe play.\nStars of the show were certainly Roman Lewis and Sophie Stevenson as Lucky and Potso. Potso commanded\nthe stage, sometimes so well that other actors were often\novershadowed.StevensonmadePotsoatoweringspidery\nscarecrow of a character, scuttling and bellowing across\nthe stage. A malevolent presence, she was brilliant as a\ntruly frightening figure, swinging rapidly from generosity to malevolence and back. Her decline in the second act\nwas made even more tragic having seen the heights from\nwhich she had fallen. A tour de force and I hope that she\nwill continue to act for the society going forward.\nLewis\u2019s commitment to the role was extraordinary,\nbending and contorting his large frame in a way that\nwas truly horrifying to witness. His famous monologue\nwas well performed if idiosyncratic. He chose to break\nup his Think with pauses and movement in a way that\nwas not completely successful. The use of language in\nthe passage, however, was striking and reached its audience more powerfully than many other productions\nhad achieved. Another talent that I hope the society will\nfoster.\nFinal commendations to the set and tech. The set was\nmimimal with a single gaunt and striking tree that dominated the stage and would not have been out of place in\nan independent London theatre.\nARTS\nDramSoc\u2019s\nWaiting for\nGodot\nArtsWriter\nCALUM DRYSDALE\nRoman Lewis, twisted and in pain as Lucky Imperial DramSoc\nA bold and challenging\nplay well excecuted.\nHamnet: The perils of adapting a book too closely\nH\namnetwasabookthatmanyreadduringCovid.Itfelt\nboth strikingly modern and deeply grounded in the\ntraditionofBritishhistoricalfiction.Tragically,how-ever, the play does not live up to the book. Like a butcher displaying the different cuts of beef, the play chopped\nup the book into a crude mockery of its source material.\nThe decision to stick obsessively close to the plot and to\ndrop the book\u2019s non-linear storytelling required a vast\namount of scenes and dialogue to be squashed into a play\nof two and a half hours. Nuance and subtly were lost as\nactors powered through story beat after story, beat before\nstripping and remaking the stage for the next moment of\nforced drama. Each scene could, by necessity, only last a\nfew minutes due to the sheer volume of material that had\nto be covered. Where the book danced lightly, allowing\nreaders to draw the connections and feel the horror of\nHamnet\u2019s oncoming death, the play felt like a plodding\nteledrama novella.\nFurthermore, the play betrayed the spirit of the book.\nIn the novel, the boy\u2019s life and fatal decision were woven through the book\u2019s story. This allowed the reader to\nimagine the emotional turbulence that Will and Agnes\nShakespeare must have felt with him gone. Their one\nson, whose birth and life, that they viewed their whole\nlife as preparation for, is snatched away from them, sending them into the depths of grief.\n\n"
