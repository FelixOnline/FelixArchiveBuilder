    "content": "22 Reviews\nBeethoven's2 nd Director: Ivan Reitman\nStarring: Charles Grodin\nThe success of the first film to star that loveable\n1501b rough-coat St Bernard called Beethoven\nhas proved to be irresistible to director Ivan\nReitman. It's sequel time again folks...\n\"He could almost be intelligent the way he looks at you.\n\"Yeah. And the dog looks pretty smart too.\"\nThis film introduces x lbs of a fetching smooth-coat St Bernard, Missy (Beethoven's love). This\ncombined with four beautiful bouncing puppies,\nhas made this another sweet film.\nBut a nightmare is brewing for dad (Charles\nGrodin) who has only just started to bond with\nBeethoven. His children are determined to turn\nthe Newton household into a quivering six St\nBernard family, insisting on keeping Beethoven,\nMissy and their offspring together. To make\nmatters worse a money hungry Regina (Missy's owner) tries to steal the puppies from Missy and\ndrown/sell them (boo, hiss...).\nA simple film in which the doggies triumph,\nthis should be popular with younger audiences\nand any accompanying not so young ones -though it may be hard to make adults admit it. In\nthe making of the film, America's supply of St\nBernard puppies is reputed to have been\nexhausted as they tend to grow a pound a day.\nThe only unfortunate aspect of this canine bliss\nis the revolting pink bow on Missy.\nR.N. Out today in London. MGM Fulham Rd, cones\n\u00a33.50 Mon-Fri before 6pm. UCI Whitelys\nQueensway, cones \u00a33.50 before 3pm. REEL^REAL\nIt's the end of the spring term and the Easter\nbreak beckons. Of course, you could spend the\nnext four weeks fever ou sly revising for exams,\nbut all work and no play makes Jack (or Jill) a very dull person indeed. Avoid that nervous\nbreakdown and catch some of the latest releases\nat the flicks over the holidays, using this handy\nguide to the best and the rest...\nJoe Public\nTom Hanks in Philadelphia\nAlready Out\nShort Cuts is over three hours of sheer\nbrilliance. Robert Altman (The Player) weaves\ntogether twenty two different characters in the\nsweltering heat of an LA summer. The large cast\nare all impressive, but the real stars are the\nstories of Raymond Carver on which the film is\nbased. It's difficult to describe how amazing this\nis, so just see it - you won't be disappointed.\nSchindler's List hardly needs any introduction\nafter winning seven Oscars, including best\npicture. This harrowing tale of the Holocaust is\nSpielberg's masterpiece and deserves to be seen\nby everyone as both a lesson and as a great piece\nof art.\nPhiladelphia has already won Tom Hanks an\nOscar for best actor, portraying a lawyer with\nAIDS. Jonathan Demme's sensitive direction\navoids any cheap emotional tricks and fine\nperformances are forthcoming from the rest of\nthe cast, especially Denzel Washington as the\nhomophobic attorney who takes Hanks' case.\nFor once, a movie that is both 'worthy' and\nworthwhile.\nWaynes World 2 is worth seeing just for the\nconcert scene and, although it doesn't do much\ndifferent from the first film, it does have the\nadded attraction of Kim Basinger as the\nbabe licious Miss Honey. Predictable, but fun in\na pretty brainless way.\nNew Releases\nFearless sees Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) coming\nto terms with the aftermath of a traumatic plane\ncrash in a 'spiritual' love story directed by Peter\nWeir (Dead Poet's Society). Rosie Perez\nreceived an Oscar nomination for her role in this\nfilm. Released in the West End on 15th April,\nand across the country on 22nd April.\nBackbeat is the true story of the fifth Beatle,\nStuart Sutcliffe, and his menage a trois with\nJohn Lennon and Astrid Kirchherr in the sombre\ncity of Hamburg. The hotly tipped Stephen Dorff\nstars and you can see it from l st April.\nKalifornia has been touted as a cross between\nThelma and Louise and The Hitcher. It got\nheavily slated in the US, but I 've heard some\nfavourable murmuring s from people who saw it\nat the London Film Festival, so it might be\nworth a look. Again, it's released on l st April.\nSister Act 2 is released today. Whoopie\nGoldberg is back in harness (or should that be\nhabit?) as the cabaret singer turned angel of\nmercy. Mercifully enough, it looks as if there\nwon't be any more sequels after this one...\nThe Scent of Green Papaya was nominated for\nan Oscar as best foreign film and is said to be a moving and intelligent portrait of Vietnamese\nvillage life in the 50s. Watch out for a review at\nthe start of next term, but if you can't wait 'til\nthen, it's released in London on Friday April l st. Read about this year's Oscars on page 24\n\n"

The tackling and\neffort throughout was immense, with everyone\ngiving 110% until the final whistle.\nJohn Cassidy could have sealed an emphatic\nvictory but dropped the ball over the line. Mark\nWishart led by example and victory was a fitting\nreward for his effort throughout the season.\nThe team was: P. Grumett, R. Carr, M. Baker,\nL. Marquis, K. Drage, J. Cassidy, M. Wishart,\nS.

Mullett.\nSpIotSoc Go Cruising\nLife in the\nShadowlands\nPerhaps you are one of those lucky students\nwith some spare cash for a well-deserved movie\nat the end of the term. Richard Attenborough's latest film Shadowlands is a moving portrayal of\nthe great writer C.S. Lewis' struggle with pain,\nsuffering, love and death; issues he had known\nonly in 'theory' but which then deeply touched\nhis life through experience. To Lewis, death\nmeant separation from a woman he loved.\nThis is one side of death, the one many have\nseen and perhaps experienced. But then the age-old questions: What about the other side? Is\nthere 'life' after death? Which 'theory' will be\nfact? What awaits us in the 'Shadowland'? Do\nwe ever glimpse what is 'beyond the veil'?\nWell, apparently some people do, one such\nbeing New Zealander Ian McCormack. He was\ndeclared clinically dead after being stung by\nbluefish while scuba-diving, but miraculously\ncame back to life. Since then, he has shared the\nmoving tale of his life-changing experience all\nover the world - a story well worth hearing,\nespecially during exams!\nSome Christian groups at IC will be hosting\na talk by Ian on Thursday 28th April in Huxley\n308 at 6pm for 6.30pm. Everyone is welcome -perhaps Ian's story can help you put together\nsome of your own Shadowlands puzzle.\nBudding Artists\nIf you want to put any artwork into the IC StaffStudent Exhibition (starting 17th May), bring it\nto the Ante Room (Sherfield) by noon on 16th May. Work must be framed (LeoSoc can help,\ncontact them beforehand). For more info contact\nLeoSoc through the ICU Pigeonholes.\nOn Saturday 5th March SpIotSoc decided to\nboldly go where no paintball club had gone\nbefore...well, not many anyway! It was decided\nto return to the urban paintball site at Greenham\nCommon and this time it was the newbies' turn\nto rock and roll in confined spaces!\nWe got up at an ungodly hour of the morning\nand, after braving London traffic in a Union\nminibus and getting onto the M4 in one piece,\nwe thought nothing would stop us getting to\nGreenham Common on time...but we forgot\nabout traffic cones, which someone had put\nacross two lanes of the M4 for no reason giving\na three mile tail back.\nSuitably stressed, we arrived half an hour late\nto find the first game had already started and\nthat a lot of the best guns had been taken. After a brief kitti ng up session and pre-game tactic\ndiscussion it was decided that:\na) we would try and obtain good guns by\nwhatever means possible, and\nb) we had no tactics at all and would go into\nheadless chicken mode whenever shot at.\nSo, out we went for some tactical repainting of a USAF airbase...and some of us came back again\neven quicker after realising that there were\nbetter players than even us on the red team.\nAfter a brief wipe down and attempts to hide\nour embarrassment about being shot out thirty\nseconds into the game, it was a case of back into\nthe firing line to try again. This time the yellows\nput up a good fight but alas were beaten again,\ndespite heroic play from all concerned.\nBy now, it was obvious something else was\nneeded, so out came thunder flashes and smoke\ngrenades, with the reasoning being that if we\ncan't shoot them we can scare them! Net result...\nten minutes later we were multi coloured again\nand needed yet another re-think!\nOur next game plan had the hallmarks of\ngenius: One gullible person running for the\ncentre flag whilst everyone else covered him.\nThe game was tense, with the flag grabber\ntaking incoming from all directions, but he got\nthe flag and ran it back to a friendly building.\nSuitably spurred on by this triumph the\nyellows proceeded to sweep the area clear of\nreds in a mass paint storm before going on to\nhang the flag for their first win of the day.\nTwo more suitably inspiring wins followed,\nwith the last game leaving both sides about\nequal on points, which is how it deserved to be.\nSuch an enjoyable day left everyone looking\nforward to next term when more trips are\nplanned including the National Student\nChampionships, which we have won for the past\ntwo years, so watch for posters.\nThe new Goya exhibition is reviewed on page 19\n\n"

    "content": "2 News\nSERC\nFunding\nSmoke Without Fire\nA member of the Fire Brigade adjusts his breathing apparatus.\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nMany postgraduate students will be\nworse off financially because of a decision by the Science and\nEngineering Research Council\n(SERC).\nThe Council, which funds many\npostgraduate students, has altered\nits student funding regulations. The\nnew rules make it impossible for\nnew postgraduates to claim daily\ntravel expenses. Also, current postgraduates will also face drastic cuts\nin the amount they are allowed to\nclaim as part of their funding. Some\nstudents have been told of reductions of several hundred pounds in\nthe amount they will get.\nSERC neglected to inform students about the changes, leading to\nfinancial problems for students who\nhad budgeted for themselves on the\nbasis of being able to claim more.\nMany student organisations, including Imperial College Union, have\nvoiced concern about the way the\nchanges have been brought in.\nInformation is being coordinated by\nunion advisers across the country\nand an organised protest from some\nsource seems likely.\nMinever Kavlak, the Union\nAdviser, described the cuts as \"a national issue which affects every\ncollege and many postgraduates\".\nStaff at SER C have revealed\nthat they have been given a standard paragraph to read out in\nanswer to all enquiries about the\ndecision. The organisation has stated that the continuation of meeting\ntravel expenses is a \"positive ges-ture\" on their part. AS ER C spokesperson agreed that students\nhave been misled. She attributed it\nto staff previously being wrongly\ntold that students who started\nbefore October 1993 would be dealt\nwith under the old rules.\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nAND MIKE INGRAM\nImperial College has played host to\na full-scale fire simulation in cooperation with the London Fire\nBrigade.\nThe exercise, which took place\non Monday, involved the evacuation of over four hundred students\nand staff from the Royal School of\nMines (RSM). It was a joint initiative between the College and the\nKensington, Chelsea and Fulham\nFire Brigades. The simulation was\nintended both to allow the building\nevacuation to be practiced and to\ngive the Fire Brigade an opportunity\nto train in a realistic environment.\nAs part of the simulation, mock\ncasualties were placed in lifts and\ntop floor rooms and a smoke\nmachine was placed at the bottom\nof one staircase in the Bessemer\nbuilding. The lighting was also shut\ndown to increase the realism of the\ntest. Additional College security\nguards were on standby to deal with\nany problems during the evacuation.\nFire-fighters from the three\nBrigades donned breathing apparatus and communication equipment\nbefore entering the building to rescue the 'casualties'. The Brigade\nsaid it was \"useful to have an exercise that enabled fire-stations to\nwork together\", something they are\nrarely able to practice but are\nexpected to do in most large scale\nfires.\nThe simulation was also\ndescribed as a good exercise in\ncommunications with the Fire\nBrigade's Control Unit (situated by\nthe Post Office on Exhibition Road)\nas it was 'on call' throughout the\nexercise.\nBarry Holt, a Departmental\nSafety Officer from the RS M and\noriginal organiser of the event, said\nthe exercise was \"realistic for us...\nand them\". He also described how\nuseful the exercise was in giving\n\"the Fire Brigade a good idea of the\nlayout of the building\".\nThe Fire Brigade were reported\nto have had slight difficulty with the\nsheer amount of hose required to be\ntransported to the source of the\n'fire'. The simulation also encountered a problem in that smoke in the\nstairwells seemed to clear faster\nthan the organisers would have\nliked.\nIt is hoped that another fire simulation will be staged in the future,\nthough it would be likely to take\nplace during a vacation to minimise\ndisruption to the College.\nSoftware Challenge Competition\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nPrizes to the value of \u00a320,000 are\nbeing offered in a competition for\nyoung computer software designers.\nBusiness Software Challenge '90s is aimed at students in higher edu-cation, as well as recent graduates,\nworking individually or in teams. It\nchallenges them to submit original\nsoftware designs - usually developed as coursework - to address\ndefined business problems.\nWinning designs from the last\nthree years have ranged from a small hotel management system to a sea-bed profiler. The competition,\norganised by the software company\nComputer Associates Pic, has\nhelped designers to develop their\nentries into commercial products.\nThe closing date for receipt of\nentries is 2nd September 1994.\nFurther details are available from\nMargaret Cunningham, Senior\nTutor in the Department of\nComputing, ext 5053.\nCopies of Cracking Cryptic Crosswords are available from Felix\n\n"

    "content": "20 Reviews\nTownes Van Zandt\nOK so this is blatant advertising, but for a great\nman. Townes has been there since before the\nbeginning of the folk outbreak which started\nwith the certain Zimmerman (aka Dylan). From\nclassic albums like 'Delta Momma Blues' to\nversions of his songs covered by the likes of\nJanis Joplin and Willie Nelson, he has been\naround to see it all.\nTownes plays his only British date for two\nyears at the Union Chapel on Saturday 23 April.\nBox Office 071 4773812, 071 3881394\nTube: Angel and Islington, Ticket \u00a310\nlit if \u00a7 fff i irp j ii Inspiral Carpets\nDevil Hopping\nHot on the heels of their smart chart hits,\n'Saturn 5' and 'I Want You', comes the\nInspiral's span kingly new and gorgeously\npackaged album, 'Devil Hopping'. And it's a class act. Less obviously commercial than either\nof the singles but full of little gems of songs and\nnuggets of feeling crystallised into lyrics.\n'Plutoman' for example, has indecipherable\nphrases which seem to make some kind of\npower chorus to satisfy the hardest of song-structure technique.\nAnd they're all like this, none really stand\nout as they are all so perfectly formed as to be\ninfallible. From the slow and delicate 'I Don't Want To Go Blind' to the more aggressive\n'Lovegrove', a range of pace and style is\ndemonstrated. The Inspirals have created a rare\nthing - a good, hyped album. (7) The Pear\nMil111\niff\n11!!!!!!!\nLotion\nFull Isaac\nBy now I'm almost getting sick of it; another\nalbum, another band from New York, another\nmix of heartland guitars, stretched vocals,\nspunky speed chords, weird titles, more plaudits\nto handout. Back home in the UK we can only\nscrap around inventing scenes so the fag-end of\npunk wasted down starts can release the odd\nsingle. Personally I'd vote for 53rd Statehood.\nOnly Morrissey, Costello and Richard\nThompson restrain my mad urge.\nLotion just wander aimless as a band. The\noccasional strings of cello or the crack of the\ntabla s mix over the deep base of a two man\nguitar team. Some tracks have strange intros\nwith out worldly voices talking mischief, \"Last\nyear at Malibu, only Jim was a fag\" as on the\nclassically balanced 'Dock Ellis'. And yes it\niji i ill lil Senser - 'Switch' They\neffortlessly fuse Kerstin's dub-pop chanting with Heitham's angry rapping to produce\nanother classic. Ridley Dash\nEchobelly - 'Insomnia' Catchy\nmelodies, tripped out interludes and Sonya\nMadan. Excellent. Camille\nTransglobal Underground - 'Earth Tribe' The\nDrum club mix is strangely reminiscent of\nDiddy's 'Give Me Love' but has sparser,\nskeletal beats, and the brilliant voice of Natacha\nAtlas. Is anyone listening? Camille\nPossum Dixon - 'Nerves' Wow! I haven't heard\nsomething this weird in a long time. Kicking drams,\nchugging bass, dissonant piano. Entertaining. Vik\nSidi Bou Said - 'Thing' ' All These Things'\nstands out from the others, gently lulling before\nthe guitar and vocals explode. Ridley Dash\nNick Cave - 'Do You Love Me' Nick Cave's world weary voice weaves through a barrage of\nmilitary style drums, waxing cynical about love\nand various sorrows. Good stuff. Joe\nThese Animal Men - 'Speed\nKing' \"Amphetamines are\nwhere it's at.\" Yeah, right.\nPerhaps if they actually took\nthe drugs they're trying to\nglorify, they'd be able to play\nthis kind of post-punk pop\nmusic with the vigour it deserves. Second hand\nenthusiasm is no enthusiasm at all. Guy\nPaw - 'Jessie' The track begins like a Nirvana\n'Bleach' out-take before quickly progressing to\nsub Alice in Chains territory. This lack of\nidentity is their fundamental problem. Ridley Dash\nTerrorvision - 'Oblivion' I 've liked everything\nthey have done to date, so I guess it was about time\nthey let me down. Here abounding doo-wop s take\ntheir '60s fascination a bit too far. Vik\n\u2022 SHI If\nprobably did only cost $570 to record. Lotion give\na private viewing, they draw the curtains and are\nintensely languid, faintly head nodding. The\ntempo at times just smiles itself into action.\nOnce, I though that Pavement were the only\nUS band worthy of Atlantic salt and now 2 years\nlater I'm sounding like Everett True - stars and\nstripes tattooed across my mind. God bless the\nQueen mum. Pah! (8) Tintin\nRaging Slab\nLondon Astoria 2\nHeadswim play the first slot. In many ways like\na trip pier Soundgarden, what sets them apart is\nthe use of keyboards; atmospheric swathes of\nsynth texture or Rhodes piano as the\ncircumstances dictate. Sanity does not appear to\nabound. The band lose themselves in an onstage\nfrenzy that proves irresistible to the crowd.\n\"Boogie rock, schm oogie rock,\" announces\nSlab singer/guitarist Greg Strzempka. \"What the\nkids want to hear these days is rap music.\"\nMaybe, but Raging Slab follow no fads.\nTheir brand of honest rock music will always be\nwelcome. They're serious about what they do\nwithout losing their sense of humour. A happy\nmedium that's hard to find in a time when bands\nseem to be either chronically depressed or\ntaking the piss. Contrary to popular belief, the\nSlab aren't full-on, deep-fried Southern boogie\nmerchants like Lynyrd Skynyrd, although the\ninfluence is there, especially in the slide work of\nthird guitarist Elyse Steinman. (When she hasn't put the guitar aside to concentrate on singing,\ndancing around dressed like a Marshall cabinet,\nor taking over on bass whilst Alec Morton plays\nmandolin.)\nMusicianship abounds; Greg also plays\nfiddle and Paul Sheehan knows that drum solos\nhave to be stupid and above all short. Guitarist\nMark Middleton takes over on vocals for a redneck version of 'Don't Bogart That Joint', by\nwhich time we know that there's still a band\ncapable of putting on a great show with a good\ntime to be had by all. Angst isn't everything you\nknow. Freddy Cheeseworth\nHas anyone followed the erratic behaviour of the music page strips? Here's where the lyrics came from tummy, chronologically. \" A Bear...\"\nis from A. A. Milne's Pooh of course. Matthew Sweet's \"Everything...\" was next from 'Someone To Pull Hie TrlR\u00abw'. Kristin Hersh was a give away 'cos I told you\n\"Never was a baritone...\" from 'Hips and Makers'. Pavement's \"mistakes..\", misquoted slightly, were from 'Zurich Is Stained'.\n\n"

Bruce Willis plays a Pittsburgh cop\nrelegated to the river rescue patrol after grassing\non his former partner and questioning his\ndepartment's investigative techniques.\nWho are we kidding? The plot is one of the\noldest in the book: There's a good cop; he has\nsome bad experiences; he spends two years in a dead-end job drinking too much Southern\nComfort; a babe shows up; his past catches up\nwith him; he shags the babe; he confronts his\npast; he saves the day; credits roll.\nSpeaking of credits, there is one worth\nmentioning: Mr Paul Abascal who put in a splendid performance as Mr Willis' hair-stylist.\nThis should not be underrated, especially\nconsidering the scenes when both of the hairs get\nwet as Mr Willis plunges into the water with\ndeath-defying determination and awe-inspiring\nenterprise. Don't get us wrong, Bruce Willis\ndoes show acting potential when he is put into\nthe right environment, namely a high-speed\ncomedy (let's have another repeat of\nli iiii iii iii il Grief\nDirector: Richard Glatzer\nStarring: Alexis Arquette\nAnother normal week at the office of 'The Love\nJudge', a frivolous daytime courtroom drama\nfeaturing circus lesbians, schizophrenic opera\ndivas, and Tourettes victims.\nBehind all this is Jo's crew: Mark, Bill, Jeremy and Leslie, Jo's assistant. This week is\nthe anniversary of Mark's lover's death by\nAIDS, leaving him feeling suicidal; and the fact\nthat he doesn't know whether Bill, to whom\nhe's attracted, is interested in him worries him\ntoo. Bill broke up with his girlfriend three\nweeks ago and Jeremy's advice to forget Bill\nmight have a baser motive. Also, who is leaving\ncondoms and lubricant on Jo's new leather sofa?\nThis is a marvellous 'Hollywood' comedy,\nwarmly and sensitively depicting its characters,\nexcept those of 'The Love Judge' of course,\nwho are as absurd as they can be...\nGo and see it if you can.\nKristine J Vaaler\nOpens at the ICA Cinema on 1st April.

Unfortunately,\nStriking Distance is neither and you are left\nlamenting the tragic waste of a good concept.\nThe, er...film, is not directed badly, it's not\nshot badly and even the acting is passable. So\nwhat if the fact that it's being set on the water is\nmade no use of. What really lets it down is the\nscreenplay. It's got the feel of a good intriguing\nstory, but by the time it reached the studio, it\nwas nothing more than a badly assembled pile of\ninteresting five minute sequences with little or\nno continuity. You never feel that you can get\ninto the characters and you get from the scenes\nof great revelation no more than you would from\nCool Runnings\nDirector: Jon Turteltaub\nStarring: Leon, Doug E. Doug, John Candy\nCool Runnings has been out a while now and\nduring that time its star, John Candy, has died. I remember thinking when I saw the trailers: \"Oh\nno, a vehicle for John Candy, in which an ageing\ncomedian indulges himself in what will probably\nbe just a mediocre film.\" People can only live off\nprevious successes for so long.\nBut now I 've seen the film, I realise that this\nwasn't the case. Don't get me wrong; John\nCandy doesn't shine comically in this movie.\nInstead, he plays the serious part and he does it\nbrilliantly. It's not the performance of a Geilgud\nor any other 'luv vie', but it's right for this role.\nThe film is based on the true story of the first\nJamaican bobsled team to compete in the Winter\nOlympics in Canada, 1987. It follows the four\nintrepid Jamaicans and their coach, Irving\nBlitzen, a disgraced previous gold medalist,\nplayed by Candy. There's also Derice Bannock\n(Leon), an Olympic class sprinter following in\nhis father's Olympian footsteps, and Sanka\nCoffie, played by a wickedly humorous Doug E. watching a TV through a shop window.\nIn all, there was as much corn popping in our\nbig bucket as there was on the big screen. There\nis one thing that still puzzles us though - the\ntitle. Striking Distance, we think to ourselves.\nWhat could it mean? To what does it refer? Did\nwe see the right film? We think not. At least the\nfilm's catchy phrase is almost right: 'They\nshouldn't have put him in the water, if they\ndidn't want him to make waves'. With a film\nlike this they shouldn't have put him in the water\nat all!\nSphenX\nOpens at Odeon Leicester Square. 15th April.\nNo student cones, admission from \u00a37.\nDoug, who provides a constant flow of rich and\nspontaneous humour.\nCool Runnings is itself a bobsled ride with\nmany twists and turns. It's one of those 'coming\nto terms with the person you really are' stories,\nbut dealt with in a lighthearted humorous way.\nThe laughs come thick and fast; no digs and\ngibes, but just the sort of belly laughs to make\nyou feel smiley and happy. A couple of serious\npoints are made, like being who you are and\ngoing after what you want, but the casual\nJamaican style of the movie manages to avoid\nthings getting too sickly. Another plus is the\nscore, a good balance of typically commercially\nviable reggae and instrumentals by Hans\n(Thelma & Louise) Zimmer.\nOther reviewers have complained about\ninsulting stereotypes in the film, but this is\nridiculous as the movie just doesn't take itself\nthat seriously. Cool Runnings is s uprising ly great\nand should be given a chance by everyone.\nA fitting end to John Candy's career.\nLittle Blue\nNow showing at Warner West End, Leicester\nSquare.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies i A New Day For The Iranians\nOne of the best examples of centuries old Iranian architecture\nSunday saw the beginning of spring and with it\nthe arrival of Norooz (literally, new day), the\nIranian New Year.\nThe Iranian calendar, being solar, consists of\n365 days (366 every 4 years) divided into twelve\nmonths, each of them corresponding exactly to\none of the houses of the horoscope.\nThis is no simple coincidence, since the\nrather dubious 'science' of astrology dates back\nto the astronomical practices of ancient\nMesopotamians whose knowledge was inherited\nby Iranians when the region was conquered by\nCyrus the Great and became part of the Iranian\nEmpire. This was expanded upon by Iranians\nand made into a practical calendar based\naccurately on the movements of the Earth\naround the Sun.\nIn view of the ancient origins of our calendar,\nit may seem strange that this weekend we will be\ncelebrating the end of the year 1372, 1372 years\nhaving passed since the prophet moved from\nMecca to Medina the event which is the starting\npoint for both the Iranian and the Arab/Islamic\ncalendars. The modern Iranian calendar was\ndrawn up and fixed by the great astronomer and\nmathematician Omar Khyram (the translation of\nhis poetry made fame and fortune for Colonel\nFitzgerald) in the 13th Century. The New Year\nceremonies, however, are a very ancient and\nwholly Iranian affair, dating back to the days\nbefore the Arab invasion and the resultant\nconversion to Islam. Unlike most other Muslims,\nIranians have held firmly on to their separate\nculture and the tradition of these ceremonies has\nbeen handed down to us by our Zoroastrian\nancestors.\nThe celebrations begin on the last Wednesday\nof the year with fireworks, usually home-made\nand rather dangerous and bonfires over which\npeople jump, signifying the life-giving powers\nof fire as like other ancient people, Iranians\nthought the Sun was made of fire.\nOn the day of Norooz, the whole family\ngathers around a table to await the exact moment\nMen's Hockey\nFor some unknown reason, 1993-94 has been the\nseason for Imperial College Hockey. Ours is not\nto ask why, ours is just to keep receiving\nmedals.\nThe Men'sl st XI won the University of\nLondon Premier League for the first time in\nmemory with an unbeaten run of games. Led by\nthe fearless, if slight, figure of Eddy Penfold, the\nteam looked like they would do the double until\nstopped by King's College in the University of\nLondon Cup semi-finals.\nPerhaps the absence of our German maestro,\nAndrea was the biggest blow in that game, as we\nfound out the hard way what an integral part of\nthe team he had become. Both as an awesomely\nlanky sweeper and a sharp short corner striker,\nAndrea was the find of the season although now\nback in his native land - ah, the cruelties of the\nshort-term MSc.\nof the arrival of the new year, to be announced\nby army guns and broadcasting media, before\nexchanging presents. Seven items are placed on\nthe table for which the Persian terms have the\ninitial letter's'( The Seven S' s): Apples signify\nresistance to worldly temptations and sins,\nyoung wheat shoots signify new life, coins stand\nfor wealth, Sumac (a spice) and vinegar signify\nthe bitter and sour taste of the trials of life,\nSamanoa (a specially cooked paste of wheat and\nsugar) stands for patience and gratefulness\ntowards the creator and finally Senjeds (a nut)\nsignifies purity.\nThe introduction of the formidable West\nLondon Institute team into our U AU group also\ncreated problems as we sealed our doom losing\n1-6. That Brunei only lost 4-1 meant they went\nthrough to the next round on goal difference.\nOur Saturday form was enim a tic in the\nextreme. The attendance of some figures,\nnotably the weekend weary fresher s, Beatty and\nJabour, combined with the northerly attractions\nexperienced by our captain-elect, Ian Haines, in\nallowing a frequently depleted team to play\nsome pretty rank hockey.\nThe determination of our wayward keeper,\nSimon Curwood, to try to score a goal also\ncontributed to the melting pot of our disgrace.\nHappily, Simon never scored, although he's now\nnot quite as fat as he once was. Yet he remains a nice blok e despite his tendency to jump into\ndoor frames. Norooz is the biggest, most important event\nof the year for all Iranians. It is a time for rest\nand recoup e ration and for family and friends to\nget together and heal any rift or wound that may\nhave been caused in the previous year.\nBy the time this article is printed, the IC\nIranian Society will have held a celebration so\nthat those of us away from home can get\ntogether. We would like to wish everyone a very\nhappy new year and hope that we all return to\nour beloved country as soon as possible.\nThe team, left to right:\nBack row: J. Furlong, D. Parkinson, J. Marshall,\nJ. Jordan, Andrea, E. Penfold (c pt),S. Curwood,\nFront row: K. Jabour, I. Haines, S. Ishtiaq, S. Lam\nCool Runnings is reviewed on page 23\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nThe FELiX Easter Egg Survey\nMany people maintain that chocolate is an effective substitute for sex. So, as winter\nrecedes and the nights become shorter, what could be nicer than curling up on a rug\nwith a large pile of rampant easier eggs? By Mike Ingram.\nFlintstones Mug Egg\n\u00a31.95\nIt seems that there are fewer eggs with mugs in\nthe shops this year. If they are all of the same\nquality as this one, then it is a great shame as we\nwere all impressed with this product.\nThe packaging for this egg is minimal: it sits\non top of a \"really cool\" Flintstones mug (there\nis a choice of designs) in a rather cheap piece of\nplastic which was apparently injection blow\nmoulded (according to our resident mechanical\nengineer). The mug itself is of much higher\nquality and was unanimously praised by the\npanel.\nUnfortunately, the chocolate doesn't match\nthe build-up it is given. It is of rather a low\nstandard and was described as \"very sugary\",\nwith a \"horrible aftertaste\". One reviewer was\ninspired into using somewhat more forthright\nlanguage that I shan't trouble you with. The\nshell has an uneven \"rippled effect\" giving\n\"bulges in places\" which are quite pleasantly\ndinosaur-like.\nThis egg is definitely recommended if you\nwant a fantastic new mug and are able to find\neither a pet or a gullible victim to feed the\nchocolate to.\nPackaging 6\nValue for Money 8\nTaste 6\nElizabeth Shaw(TM)\n\u00a35.99\nThis egg sets out to intimidate you right from\nthe start. It costs nearly six quid and comes with\na drum-kit arrangement of \"mint biscuits inside\na welding helmet\". The general consensus was\nthat the box goes \"way over the top\" trying to\nimpress. Looking at the outside, we expected to\nfind \"oe uf tr op cher\" written somewhere (in that\nlovely gold-leaf handwriting, of course.)\nThe manufacturers have also adopted the\n'kung fu action movie' technique of telling you\nwhat they are going to do to you before they\nactually do it. Two paragraphs on the back of\nthe box warn you of the company's fame,\nlowering your guard for the final showdown.\nThe chocolate itself is a different story\nentirely. If you have ever liked dark chocolate,\nthis will blow your mind. The smooth minted\ntaste reduced our reviewers to comments like\n\"orgasmic\", \"cosmic\" or \"good quality internal\nfinish\". The individually packaged supporting\nmints are also excellent.\nAll in all, this is an egg that is best either to\ngive or receive as a present. If it is at all\npossible, we recommend eating it all yourself\nand being sick.\nPackaging 7\nValue for Money 7\nTaste 9\nThe Verdict\nEggies (Mr Bendy) 8\nElizabeth Shaw( TM)7 Flintstones Mug 7\nQuality Street 6\nDairy Box 6\nGalaxy Truffles 6\nPingu 6\nSmarries Egg 5\nFlake Egg 4\nFlake Egg\n\u00a32.65\nThe tension as this box was brought into view\nwas palpable. The other eggs had been mere\nforeplay. This was the big one. Donning their\nlingerie, the reviewers delved in.\nThe packaging was almost universally\nunpopular. Comments ranged from \"blatantly\nyellow\" and \"asymmetric\" to \"I like it\". The\nheterosexuals, agreeing that the box was probably\ndesigned for women, suggested putting some of\nthem on the box. Busy executives and people in a hurry should note that this box was by far the\neasiest of all to open. The egg itself shows class:\nit comes pre-halved and is printed with\nCadbury's traditional duck. The chocolate tastes\nmuch the same as that in a Flake, but \"loses the\ntexture\" - some were just \"not impressed.\"\nAnother surprise was the inclusion of two\nbog-standard Flakes in the packaging. Most of\nthe reviewers had expected specially designed\nsmaller Flakes, but were thankful that this meant\nthere was no danger of a repeat of the Smarties\nfiasco (see other page).\nFinally the panel agreed that it would be\nmuch better to \"go and buy a box of Flakes\ninstead\" unless you're courting a to polo gist.

Is he doing his job and, more\nimportantly, is he doing it properly!\nIf you read the news story on page three, you\nwill see that he's screwed up over the sabbatical\nelections. There was late publicity for the\nhustings, virtually no publicity for new election,\nfewer voting stations because of too few swipe\ncard readers, a non-secret secret ballot, no proxy\nvoting, no flyers to all the students as\npromised...the list could go on.\nBut this non-secret ballot. How can someone\nbe that stupid? Under no circumstances should\nyou say who's paper it is if you happen to know.\nAll you have to say is: \"Yes, that paper is OK.\"\nDoes he not think before he does things? Does\nhe not appreciate the seriousness of the position\nhe is in and the responsibility that goes with it?\nThere are a number of things other than the\nelection screw-up that I could mention, but I don't have the space to highlight them all. One\nthat I could mention is his lack of common\ncourtesy and professionalism. On a number of\noccasions he has arranged meetings with\nstudents and then turned up late.\nOne example is an election interview for\nFelix. It was originally arranged for an afternoon,\nbut Andy postponed it until 9am the following\nmorning. He had to be phoned at 9:15am because he was still in bed and he eventually\nturned up at 10:20am, over an hour late.\nMaybe he oversleeps after arranging\nmeetings with College management as well. But\nif he can't make the effort to arrive on time for\nmeetings he has arranged himself, I think it's disgraceful.\nAdd this to everything else this year and it\ncomes as no surprise that comments such as\n'horse's arse' and 'fuck wit' are being made\nabout Andy Wensley.\nTick Tock\nThe clocks go forward one hour\nthis Sunday morning. We'll be in\nBritish Summer Time at last and,\nlooking at the weather, I can almost believe it.\nDon't forget to reset your watches.\nOn the subject of time, according to the New\nScientist, we'll be gaining some time this June.\nThe International Earth Rotation Society has\ndecided that we will all have an extra second\nadded to our lives between 23:59:59 and\n00:00:00 on 30th June. Don't forget to reset your\nwatches for this too and use this extra time\nwisely!\ng mk Poison\nThe cause of death of Whiskas is still\nunclear, but contrary to the letter from\nAndy Clark, we were not feeding it\ndry roasted peanuts; it was surviving quite\nhappily on a diet of Basics pizza bases and\nchocolate, with the occasional handfuls of\nproper mouse food or muesli.\nClaims have been made, though, that\nWhiskas wasn't the original mouse that escaped\nfrom Biology two and a half years ago. Certain\nmembers of the Felix Office staff have\nsuggested that they have been replacing the\nmice as they die off.

This is just one of many incidents; to\ncatalogue them all would take up an entire page.\nThe above example illustrates perfectly the\nunwillingness of the housekeeper to deal\nefficiently with problems with student defects\netc only aggravates our situation as opposed to\na lie via ting it.\nSurely rent of nearly \u00a350 per week entitles us\nto a safe hall environment with appliances which\nfunction properly.\nWe feel that we are treated as second class\ncitizens, not as rent payers with tenants' rights.\nIn our belief, our accommodation contract\nhas been broken.

Like Blake in England,\nGoya became an isolated figure, a man who saw\nhis life become littered with catastrophes: an\nillness which left him deaf at 46, an increasing\nirreligious ness, the deaths of all but one of his\nchildren and the ripping askew of Spain during\nthe Napoleonic Wars of 1793-1814.\nAnd so it is that the highlights of London's first major Goya exhibition for thirty years are\nseen in the macabre. Yet a large segment of the\nexhibition is taken up with the sketches he\ncarried out prior to his full scale work. While\nthese are scholarly they remain sketches, pieces\nof ep hemera at worst, and strangely lifeless.\nThe raw scenes are pretty blood curdling,\nthough. The first hint of impending fantasy is the\nsketch to St Francis Borja at the deathbed of an\nImpenitent. As gloating devils wait for the man\nto die, the cross wielded by St Francis spurts\nblood, thus saving the Impenitent from hell.\nA series of works on witchcraft display\nGoya's shrieking imagination. In The Spell, a crazed hag reaches out for a victim, whilst\nbehind her, the other cronies clutch at babies and\nstick pins into a voodoo doll. Above, owls and\nbats swoop down from the darkness. And so it\ngoes on. In front of the cannibal pictures a sturdy\nold lady remarked, \"disgusting\". On moving to\nthe next picture all she could add was\n\"absolutely disgusting\".\nThe satire on the vicious Inquisition was also\npart of Goya's concern. He himself was indicted\nin 1815 for an obscene picture. The parade of\ngory flagellates and the hopelessness of those\ncondemned to death remind us of the times of\nreligious brutality. There is more. Scenes of\nlunatics, lots of lunatics, a shipwreck, robberies\nand bullfighting, more gored victims.\nIt would give a false impression to say that\nsuch works make up the majority of this\nexhibition, for there are rural settings, portraits\nand miniatures. But nothing can compare to the\nimagination of a deaf man set wild. His Self\nPortrait in the Studio has the painter steeped in\nan oversized square edged hat, looking outwards\nas if you are the subject of his brush. Goya was\nnothing if not a social realist, he based his\npaintings on what he saw. His momentous\netchings, The Disasters of War, (not displayed)\nshow that show powerfully. His works of\ndarkness did not just involve fantasy.\nGoya didn't need to twist things much to\ncreate his eye churning monsters. All he needed\nto do was look.

Now it's back, bigger than ever and in a new format, a centre page pull-out.\nPutting the booklet together as indicated on\nthe pull-out pages, you will notice that there are\n15 consecutive 15x15 crosswords. These make up\na15 x15x15 layered cube...our crossword grid.\nThe puzzle is solved in exactly the same way\nas a standard cryptic crossword (see the series of\nCracking Cryptic Crosswords that has been\nrunning in the last eight issues of FELiX, copies\nstill available) with the addition of a set of\n'through' clues as well as the usual 'across' and\n'down'.\nFor the Solver's Convenience...\n...squares containing a 'through' word have been\nshaded in grey and, for long through words (any\nof nine letters or over), we have included a series\nof dashes (of the number of letters in the word)\nfor you to fill in any letters provided by crossing\nwith another word on any particular level.\nWhy it is Easier to Solve than its\n2-Dimensional Cousin\nIt will soon become apparent that due to the\nincreased checking (crossing of any two words)\nthis crossword is actually easier to solve than its\n2D cousin! This is because, after answering the\neasier clues, you will find that most of the\nremaining words will have a higher proportion\nof their letters already filled in. But don't just\ntake our word, try it and find out for yourself.\nWhy it is a Real 3D Crossword\nMany 3D crosswords that have existed so far\nhave been of the type shown here (left). These\nare, in our opinion, not true 3D crosswords as they are merely six\nsets of 2D crosswords linked at\nthe edges. The one shown here\n(right) is our\nformat, a 'true' 3D crossword,\nas any given square can be\npart of an across, down and\nthrough word simultaneously.\nIn keeping with 2D standards, our crossword is\nnot only 15x15x15( an extension of the\nbroadsheet standard 15x15), but it is also 4-way\nrotation ally symmetrical on each level and the\nwhole stack is 2-way rotation ally symmetric in\nthe other two planes.\nCompetition and Separate Clue\nWriting Competition\nCompetition details are given in the assembled\nbooklet, along with details of an additional clue\nwriting competition. They can be entered\nindependently of each other and for both\ncompetitions we have managed to obtain a top\nprize of a Chambers dictionary - the Bible of the\ncrossword world.\nFinal Erratum\nIn addition to the one erratum in the booklet,\nanother was discovered before going to press:\n1. Level 15, 7-t.(12) should be (14) and thus\nyou also need to add a couple more dashes.\nP.S. There's a long stapler available in the FELiX Office for stapling you booklet together.\nApril sees the introduction of the\nCollege's new telephone system.\nDo you need your stationery reprinted\nwith your new telephone numbers?\nThen contact:\nICU Print Unit, Felix Office,\nBeit Quad or phone ext. 8672\nPrices from \u00a326.00 (+ VAT)\n(for 250 Letterheads, black ink printed on high quality watermarked paper)\nOther options available on request.\n\n"

    "content": "28 Feature\nThe Other Prisoner:\nAutumn Through Mirrorshades\n- Where am I? In the village.\n- Ooh, that sounds nice.\n- Information - what?\n- Oh yes, I'm sure I 'll enjoy my time here.\n-Eh?\n- Did you say you wanted information? Well\nhere goes. First when I was ten I... AAAA A RRR GG GH HH HH! In 1967, a Government Secret Agent resigned\nfrom his post, only to wake up hours later in a strange community known only as the Village.\nIts location: Unknown. Its inhabitants: Known\nonly by their number. Our hero, No. 6,\npersistently attempted to escape, whilst those in\ncharge endeavour ed to obtain vital information\nfrom him. For copyright reasons, this is not his\nstory. With apologies to ITC entertainments, it is\nthe story of one of his fellow prisoners, No. 9...\nThe year is 1994. No. 9 did not resign his top\nGovernment post. He was sacked. For being an\nirritating g it. His employers arranged for him to\nbe taken to the Village, persuading the\nauthorities to let him stay there, despite the fact\nthat his job had nothing to do with the Secret\nService. In short, they lied.\nSeveral months later...\nNo. 9 woke up, stretched and yawned. It was\nan hour before the official wake-up call. This\nwas not unusual. He got up, waved at the\nsurveillance camera planted in the upper wall\nand began his morning walk. This was not\nunusual. He entered the official building, with a cheerful smile - No. 9 really enjoyed the\nmorning. And his meetings with No. 2. In fact,\nNo. 9 really enjoyed the Village.\n\"Hello, No. 2. How are you this fine\nmorning?\" he greeted.\n\"Oh, morning John, how's yourself? Up early\nagain, I see,\" the older man replied.\n\"Oh, no, NO! How many more times! I am\nnot a name, I am a number! No. 9! Get it?!\"\n\"Well, as you will, old chap, now what can\nwe do for you today?\"\n\"I 've come to confess. To tell more things -everything I know. All the reasons. Everything.\"\n\"Right, er, I don't think that'll be necessary.\nAfter all, you did all that yesterday. And the day\nbefore. And the day before that, too. Now, why\ndon't you run along and try and join in with\nsome of the other villagers?\" the Chief\nSupervisor suggested.\n\"But I 've done all that already. Only\nyesterday, I arranged four human-chess matches\nand two No. 2 commemorative concerts and\nexhibitions.\"\n\"Well, then, just push off, there's a good\nchap, will you.\" With that, No. 2 swung round\nhis chair, turning to his back to indicate that the\ninterview was over. You will not be surprised to\nlearn that none of this was unusual either.\nThe next day, John, sorry No. 9, woke up,\nstretched and yawned. And then blinked because\nthe Village was unearthly silent. Even though\nhe'd woken early, there was not a single sound\nto be heard. This was very unusual. Foregoing\nhis usual routine, he left his house and stepped\ninto the ever present cool sunshine. A pair of\nrowing oars had been left, propped against his\nwall. This was very unusual. Next to them, a telescope was perched, pointing out to sea. He\nexamined it, looked through and saw, drawn up\nonto the beach, a small one-man boat. Complete\nwith mast and sail. This, too, was unusual.\nIndeed, today would be very, very strange.\nCurious, he picked up the oars and set off in the\ndirection of the shore.\nA few minutes later, No. 9 stood beside the\nsturdy little craft and began to examine it, to try\nand ascertain from where and from whom it had\ncome. It was certainly very seaworthy, almost\nbrand new and, partially covered in the stern,\nthere appeared to be about a months worth of\nprovisions, carefully wrapped and packaged to\nprotect them from a potentially long and arduous\nsea voyage. Very strange indeed. It was then that\nhe heard the first sound of the day, as a gull flew\noverhead, heading inland. Following it with his\neyes, No. 9 observed another curious fact.\nAlthough he could see his house and a few other\nbuildings of the Village, he could not see the\nimposing Green Dome, the nerve centre for the\nauthorities. The boat had been left in such a position so that it could be seen from his house\nand yet remained invisible to the eyes of No. 2's residence.\nQuickly he ran back up to the Village, racing\nthrough its deserted streets until, breathless, he\nstood panting by the front door of the Dome. To\nthis portal a note was pinned which read:\nHave gone off all day. Won't be back till late.\nHave taken Rover (the Village guardian) with\nme. Signed No. 2.\nPS There's a map and compass under the seat.\nNo. 9 read this, considered it for a moment\nand then removed the note from the door and\ntore it up. Then he stalked back to his own\nhouse. The door, for once, did not open\nautomatically, so No. 9 had to pull hard to get it\nopen. Once inside, he sat down for a moment\nand then busied himself making some tea.\nThe next thing he knew, four thugs, the kind\nemployed by No. 2, barged into his home and\nproceeded to beat him up. For an on compliant Prisoner, this was common practice, but No. 9\nhadn't experienced anything like it before. He\ndid not resist, therefore, until they began to drag\nhim towards the door. By then, resistance was\nuseless and, knocking him out, they bundled him\noutside and into the waiting small car. This then\ndrove them down to the beach where the four\nmanhandled his limp body into the waiting boat\nand then slowly launched the craft into the sea.\nThe strong current and wind soon carried the\nlittle boat into the distance and, satisfied, the\nthugs returned to the now strangely active\nVillage. From the observation room a smiling\nNo. 2 watched the boat disappear over the\nhorizon.\nNo. 9 didn't know how long he'd been at sea\nbut it seemed like many days and the food\nsupply was beginning to get low. Despite this,\nhe continued to use the map and compass\nintently, steering to his own highly accurate\ncourse. He was resting today after the exertions\nof yesterday - a fishing trawler had spotted his\nboat and had tried to offer him a ride. It had\ntaken all his remaining strength to row\nfrantically in the opposite direction, so that now\nhe lay exhausted in the bow of the small sea-vehicle. He thoughtfully rubbed his new grown\nbeard and gazed off into the middle distance at\nthe far-off coast. He rubbed his eyes with\nastonishment but there was no denying that, after\nso long, he had finally sighted land. Quickly, he\ngrabbed the oars and began to furiously row for\nshore.\nAfter landing, he grimly used the remainder\nof a paraffin stove to douse the boat and then lit\na match. As the burning craft slipped back into\nthe sea, No. 9 wearily began to climb back up\nthe beach to the dry land. Another twenty\nminutes had passed before he finally stood\ntriumphantly atop the cliff. Looking inland, laid\nbefore him were the many houses of the Village.\nNo. 9 smiled and swiftly began to descend the\nslope.\nWith a cheery smile and a jaunty step, he\nmarched through the door of the Green Dome\nand into the office of No. 2.\n\"Hello, No. 2, it's me again, sir, I'm back!\"\nNo. 2's face fell and he collapsed onto the\nfloor. Weakly he grabbed his phone and sobbed,\n\"It's no good. I can't take it. I need a replacement.\"\nAn end...\nRemember - we're all prisoners - it's just\nthat not all of us live in strange village\ncommunities in remote parts of Wales, peopled\nby men and women known only by their number\nand who follow strange and rigid rules and...\nFELiX\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB( Tel: 071 225 8672).\nEditor: Rebecca Land, Business Managers: Simon Govier, Steven Newhouse.\n^s xJ^ uZ^^t^^\\ coiled Copyright Felix 1994.

    "content": "24 Feature\n\"I'd Like To Thank My Plumber...\"\nTony Grew sheds some light on the glitter and the dazzle of the Oscars.\nThe Oscars. What the bloody hell is all\nthat about, I hear you cry. The annual\nback-slapping and bitching of the world's best known film awards is legendary and\nfor movie professionals there is the\nchance to possess what Mae West once\ncheekily called \"the most sought after\nthirteen inches in Hollywood\". Or was\nthat Errol Flynn? Anyway, the point is\nthat in its 66 year history the Academy\nAwards have had some famous and\nequally infamous moments. So we here at\nFelix have decided to answer all the\nquestions that keep you awake at night or\nat least the ones about the Oscars.\nThe first one that springs to mind is:\nWhy call them Oscars anyway? This is\nan easy one actually, depending on who\nyou believe. Most likely is an academy\nemployee called Margaret Herrick who,\nin 1935, exclaimed that the award looked\nlike her Uncle Oscar. The proper title of\nAcademy Awards doesn't have the same\nring to it somehow. Bette Davis claimed\nthat she named it because of the\nsimilarity to the behind of one of her\nhusbands but, frankly, no-one believes\nher. It is, in fact, supposed to represent a nude knight holding a sword where his\ncricket box should be and standing on a reel of film. Why anybody would claim\nthis to be the behaviour of anyone they\nknew (even a Tory MP) is beyond me but\nthere you go. If I had an uncle who\nbehaved like this, I certainly wouldn't tell\nanyone. The actual award is worth about\n$200, weighs a little over eight pounds\nand is gold plated bronze.\nThe next obvious question is: What\nAcademy? Well, it is the Academy of\nMotion Picture Arts and Sciences and it\nwas founded in 1927. Lots of very famous\npeople are in it, as well as the people that make\nit all possible. There are about 4,000 members\nand it costs $175 a year but you really do have to\nbe asked. Anyone nominated to receive an Oscar\nis offered membership immediately. If you have\npowerful friends and major screen credits, you\nalso have a good ish chance.\nSo how does a film get nominated? The\nprocess is pretty simple really. The Academy is\ndivided into twelve branches, such as actors,\nwriters and directors. The members of each\ngroup send in their top five recommendations in\ntheir particular field of expertise and everyone\nmakes recommendations for Best Picture and\nBest Foreign Language Film. The five most\npopular choices in each category are then the\nnominations and the whole Academy then votes\non these. Simple. This explains why a nomination is so important; it is recognition\nfrom your peers that you do good work. The\nAcademy as a whole may not agree though, the\ncase of Steven Spielberg being a notable\nSpielberg's List: His films claimed a grand total often Oscars.\nexample. Previous to his awards this year he had\nbeen nominated on three occasions but never\nmanaged to carry it off. This means that the\ndirectors valued him more than everyone else. The\nvotes are counted by the accountancy firm, Price\nWaterhouse, who are the only ones who know\nwho has won before the envelopes are opened.\nWhy the tacky ceremony then? TV possibly has a lot to do with the present form of\nthe awards. Whoopi Goldberg had the supreme\nhonour of hosting the proceedings this year,\nthereby becoming the first African-American to\ndo so. The gold envelope bit is interspersed with\nvarious dire song and dance routines starring the\nlikes of Jerry Lewis. It always runs over time,\nusually because of the...\nSpeeches. These are always the most\namusing aspect of the ceremony and there have\nbeen some memorable gaffs. Cher, as well as\nhaving the dress sense of a retarded yak, also\nmanaged to give one of the least comprehensive\nthank you speeches in history, remembering\nonly to mention her hairdresser and make-up\nartist. She subsequently had to take out a three page ad in the trade papers the next\nday thanking everyone she forgot. The\nderanged babbling s of Sally Field (\"You\nlike me! You cannot deny that you actually\nlike me at this moment!\") are recalled with\ngroans. She really should have learned from\nthe Great One, Jack Nicholson, who oozed\ncharm from every pore behind his\nsunglasses when picking up his 1975 nod\nfor One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. \"I guess this proves there are as many nuts in\nthe Academy as anywhere else,\" he\nmumbled, before ambling off in the wrong\ndirection. What a guy. Many believe the\n1982 sweep by Ghandi is what led to the\nnow traditional Dickie Attenborough cry-in.\nHankies out, too, for Sylvester Stallone\nwho was overcome with emotion when\nRocky won best picture in 1976. Which\nleads very neatly on to the topic of...\nUnexpected winners and indeed losers.\nWhilst Rocky may seem like a prime\nexample of the innate nuttiness of the\nvoting patterns of the Academy, there has\nbeen worse over the years, not least Julie\nAndrews for Mary Poppins. Incidentally,\nDick Van Dyke was nominated for his role\nin that modern classic, probably single-handedly responsible for the introduction of\ndialect coaches for all Americans.\nThis year, it has been very much an\nOscars ceremony for remembering people\nthe Academy have passed over in the past.\nThis year's winners have really yielded no\nsurprises, with the long deserved\nrecognition of Spielberg as a modern day\ngod of directing. After the appa ling snub of\nThe Color Purple in 1988 (nominated for\nten and won none) it has just been a matter\nof time, but of course Hook really wasn't the film to honour. The Best Film Oscar for\nSchindler's List is a powerful vindication of\nUniversal's courage in financing and supporting\nwhat must have seemed such a dod gy proposition at the time and I feel personally\nvindicated at the Best Actress award for Holly\nHunter. Ever since Broadcast News I have been\ntrying to convince people of her brilliance and\nnow they have finally seen the light. Tom\nHanks, a firm favourite with the Academy, is no\nsurprise either, especially in his first serious role.\nThe cinematography was, of course, worthy of\nits award; I have always felt they should give\none to everyone in this category, but I do feel on\nthis occasion Schindler's List had to be\nrecognised yet again. The chilling ly bright black\nand white added immeasurably to the horror of\nthe story. With Spielberg's films collecting ten\nawards in total, the competition stood no chance\nreally. It's unfortunate that Robert Altman had to\nbe nominated in the same year as Spielberg. We\ncan only hope that his next piece will be half as\ngood as Short Cuts.\nThe annual Felix Easter Egg survey is on pages 6 and 7\n\n"

    "content": "4 Feature\nThe Many Moods of Mahler's Fifth\nThe evening of 11th March saw the second\nconcert this academic year by the Imperial\nCollege Symphony Orchestra (ICSO). The\norchestra, conducted by the College's Musician\nin Residence, Richard Dickins, represents some\nof the best instrumental talent that Imperial has\nto offer. Their programme consisted of Mahler's Fifth Symphony, a large and demanding work -there were nearly ninety performers on stage.\nAs to the music, ICSO played with style and\nvigour. The symphony consists of many mood\nswings, from mourning through wild despair to\njubilation, all carefully controlled and executed\nby Richard and the players. Occasionally the\nbrass had a tendency to overplay during the\njoyful chorale sections, bringing an unwanted\nharsh edge to the sound; though this was mainly\ndue to the poor musical acoustic of the Great\nHall. The fourth movement Adagietto, for strings\nonly, was played beautifully with well sustained\nmelodic lines, while the last movement stormed\nto a close with great panache.\nThe principal trumpet is heard many times\nduring the piece, including at the start, and\nStephen Hicks must be congratulated for his\nplaying. Amongst others, Paul Gowling should\nbe mentioned for some good o bb liga to horn\nplaying in the third movement, and Ann Turner\nfor the angelic touches of harp in the Adagietto.\nThis was also a special concert for ICSO, as\nit marked two events. Firstly it was Richard's fifteenth year with the orchestra, for which he\nreceived various presents, including a score of\nMahler's Fifth. Also, it marks the first concert\nfor the new leader, Edward Bale. ICSO's former\nleader, Heather McCann, was thanked for all her\nwork over the previous years with the orchestra.\nThe evening was a great success. The drama\nof Mahler's score was well portrayed, with only\na few imperfect moments. I look forward to\ntheir next concert.\nPaul Gowling (second from right), ICSO's principal horn Frank Taylor\nWell-Drilled Choirin Verdi's Requiem\nThe Great Hall was filled to overflowing last\nFriday evening, with over 600 people in the\naudience for the College Choir's performance of\nVerdi's Requiem mass. Eric Brown, the Choir's everlasting conductor (he was the Choir's first\naccompanist and has conducted their every\nperformance since the '50s) remains a choir\ntrainer of the very highest order. Every member\nof the Choir seemed confident of what he or she\nwas doing, and each part was clearly audible in\nthe complex sections where the Choir splits into\neight very separate parts.\nAnother hallmark of their meticulous drilling\nis the ability to stand up or sit down together\nsilently; many more famous choirs would do\nwell to take note! Unfortunately 108 student\nvoices simply didn't have the power to cut\nthrough heavy brass (it is brave to do this work\nwith anything less than 150 mature voices), and\nit was amusing at times to see them clearly\nsinging at the tops of their voices to little audible\neffect!\nThe accompaniment is often the weak link in\nIC Choir's performances, because the orchestra\nis made up of individuals who, although in the\nmain very good players, are not used to playing\nas an orchestra; add to this a conductor who is\nnot always entirely clear (at one point he decided\nto conduct three consecutive bars at three\ncompletely different speeds for no reason that I could fathom!) and a tendency to raggedness is\nthe result. Prof Brown also seemed to be taking\nthe occasional rest, sitting on the small\nbalustrade at the back of his podium, but I think\nthis was just to give him a better idea of what the\nsoloists were doing! In addition in this particular\nperformance the brass playing was not always\nup to the rest and arguably should at times have\nbeen more sensitive to the needs of the\ncomparatively small choir.\nSoloists are often a problem for the Choir,\ndue at least in part to its limited resources, but\non this occasion the standard was unusually\nhigh. The tenor in particular shone radiantly, and\nthe soprano (despite a rather fast vibrato which\nsome found annoying) was also well up to the\npart - her top C came over the full choir and\norchestra with all the power required, yet she\nwas sensitive where necessary too. The mezzo\nand bass could each have done with more power\nat times, but nobody could complain about the\nquality of their tone.\nChris Purvis\nThe first issue of Felix next term will be on 29th April\n\n"

The\nstage crew moved like clockwork figures to a techno ish yet folk ish back beat that, to me,\nrecalls the summer festivals more than any\nspl iff, band or barbecue. The music was two\nyears late to these ears, was culled from\n'Screamadelica' and the band were Primal\nScream. The unlikely promoters of dance...\nWhat Primal Scream did, like the Stone\nRoses before them, was produce music that\nblended the Euphoric rush of rave with enough\nrock-c red and attitude to convince committed\nindie-lovers that you could cross over, if only for\na night. Pop down to a warehouse and pop those\nEs. And with 'Give Out...' it's almost like\nthey're crossing back, a dove with an olive\nbranch, bringing their dance cronies to the world\nof the Rolling Stones. I see Bobby Gillespie\n(playing musical cookery - the last great wok\nstar?) get back from an all-night er, whacked out,\n\u2022I1IB\nSubmarine\nSubmarine\nOpening with 'I Can't Be Satisfied', it becomes\napparent that Submarine never submit to\ncomplacency; despite knowing that conceit can\nsometimes lubricate the mind and can ease\npressure. This refusal to be smug is perhaps the\nbasis of their creative impetus.\nThe tre bly crunch of Neil Haydock's guitar\nsprawls in all directions and lights the sky,\nwhile the reverberating atmospheric s of 'Alright\nSunshine Song' gives peripheral vision. In the\nslower, sparser moments, they sound like\nCodeine; but when they ignite they cut through\nsheet metal.\nA transient, unreal quality about them makes\nthem stand out; the unpredictable repeated\nreprises of 'Lips and Fingers', for example, are\nbrilliant. While on the cover, a vision of a family on the beach gives an almost apocalyptic\nimpression. The fruits if their work deserve\nsome attention; I hope they don't end up piss in' in the wind.\nProduced by Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev\nproducer Keith Cleversley, Submarine have all\nthe hallmarks of an American band. But they're\nfrom London. Get yer cheesy grin around that\none. (7) Camille\nwith a few assorted c lubbers and in the early\nmorning the discussion turns to idols; our Bob\nsays: \"Well, 2 Unlimited are all very well lads\nbut I 'll level - it's Mick and Keef that really\nturned me on...\" And then they get out their\ninstruments and prove it, play 'Exile on Main\nStreet' right there in the front room. The\nc lubbers gasp and want more and the Scream\nnod sage ly, remembering how much they made\non duty-free imports last crossover.\nSee, despite what the music press would have\nyou believe, 'Give Out...' is not the greatest 70s record never made. It is, however, a great\n\u2022 ni \u2022 J1ill!\nInsides\nClear Skin\n'Clear Skin' uses the ideas from the band's past\nand takes them a few steps further. This is what\nambient music should be about - finely crafted\nwashes of sound, samples and instruments used\nto create music that takes you out of your\nmundane little life and transports you\nsomewhere... One track, 38 minutes. Most\nbands wouldn't dare, most of those that did\nwould come up with no more than aural\ncandy floss, only suitable for consumption with\nlarge quantities of our favourite soft drug. 'Clear\nSkin' needs no narcotic assistance to be\nbeautiful. It starts with a ripple of xylophone\nand gradually builds up, piling on the guitars,\nvocal loops, samples - including that old\nchestnut, running water - until it all fuses,\nbreaks down and does it all again, only better.\nThe Insides are reclaiming ambient music\nfrom the inept clutches of innumerable bilge\nmerchants. That they are gradually gaining\nsome sort of recognition from the mainstream is\nto be welcomed with relief. We need music as\nendlessly inventive, as otherworldly, as fresh as\nthis to remind ourselves that good music does\nnot begin with loud guitars and blistering\npassion. (9) Ridley Dash\nexample of how retro music can mean\nrevolution. True, 'Jailbird' and 'Rocks' are\nthundering leather clad beasts that'll have you\nrushing for a Harley and a highway, an the mic tech nicol our blasts of life, old Stones style. But\nthe title track, or the endlessly dance able 'Struttin', pay their dues to late eighties dance,\nMassive Attack style rhythm soliloquies and\neven their own 'Screamadelica'.\nSo, while Denise Johnson and George\nClinton add funky soul to songs that'll do fine\nfor my roadie backdrop this summer, it's 'Jailbird' that I 'll be hitching to...

    "content": "News 8\nEquestrian Elections Science Week\nWilliam Waldegrave visits Imperial College earlier this week\nFollowing the close of this year's sabbatical elections, there is controversy surrounding the way in which\nthey were run.\nIt seems certain that the secrecy\nof the ballot has been broken with\nthe identity of a voter being connected to one of their ballot papers.\nThe current voting process is\ndesigned to make this impossible.\nThe ballot paper in question was\nused at the close of voting after one\nvoting station had run out of papers\nfor one of the posts. The Returning\nOfficer, Andy Wensley, printed\nmore and verified the only one used\nby signing it in ink. All other papers\nhad a photocopied signature.\nAccording to the people counting the votes in that particular ballot\nbox, the paper was queried due to\nthe difference in the signature. One\nperson said that Mr Wensley then\n\"definitely\" identified the voter as\nhe certified that the paper was valid.\nThis has been backed up by other\npeople who were at the count.\nIn an interview with Felix, Mr\nWensley first denied the event, saying the paper could not have been\nidentified: \"It was a secret ballot.\nFull stop.\" He later admitted that he\ncould have identified the paper,\nsaying: \"I don't think it was [identified].\" He added: \"I must admit, it\nwasn'ta high point of the evening\n- being asked 'is this a spoilt\npaper?'.\"\nOne person present at the count\nhas alleged that he then revealed the\nway in which the votes were cast on\nthe ballot paper.\nMany people have questioned\nwhether President should be the\nReturning Officer. Mr Wensley\nagreed that either a member of\nUnion staff or one of the Deputy\nPresidents may be in a better position to do the job.\nLast Thursday's Schrodinger\nLecture by Nobel Laureate Max\nPerutz revealed the workings of\nhaemoglobin, the 'breathing' mole-cul e. Speaking to a packed Great Hall,\nDr Perutz explained how haemoglobin transports oxygen around the\nbody with an animated film of it\n'breathing' (changing its shape to\npick up and release oxygen).\n\"Haemoglobin is a moving\nmechanism,\" he explained, \"a mole-Students have expressed concern\nat the lack of publicity for New\nElection. At the South Kensington\nHustings, New Election was only\nmentioned by Mr Wensley at the\nend, after having to be reminded.\nPosters advertising the Hustings\nwere not put up until the day they\nwere due to take place. In his\ndefence, Mr Wensley said the\nposters were only \"to remind\npeople\". He also said that New\nElection was publicised on a flyer\ndistributed around College.\nPreliminary results from a survey carried out by Felix show that\nonly 5.6% of students interviewed\nsaid they had read the flyer. This\nmay be attributable to it not being\nsent to every eligible student as was\noriginally promised by Andy\nWensley. This was in spite of\naddress labels having been obtained\nand people having offered to stick\nthem to the flyers well in advance\nof them being sent out.\nThe survey also asked students\nabout what prompted them into vo t ing. None of those interviewed\nrated the flyer as their primary\ninfluence, while over 15% cited\ncandidates' posters. This may indicate that the major force behind this\nyear's record turnout was campaigning by the candidates. The\nsurvey ended by asking students\ntheir opinion of the President and\nhow he is doing his job. Almost\nhalf of those interviewed were\nindifferent. An equal percentage\n(6%) of students described him as\n\"good\" as called him a\" a horse's arse\".\nPerhaps ironically, Mr Wensley\nsaid this year's election committee\nintend to produce a document\nadvising on election matters for\nfuture reference.\ncula r machine.\"\nThe Lecture, entitled 'Living\nMolecules' was an overview of\nresearch into the structure of DNA,\nas well as Dr Perutz's own work on\nhaemoglobin. He illustrated his talk\nwith molecular models and even\ndemonstrated the extraction of\nDNA using a kitchen blender!\nDr Perutz, who is still an active\nresearcher at 80, received the prize\nfor his work deciphering the structure of haemoglobin. He finished by\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nWilliam Waldegrave, Science\nMinister, visited Imperial College\nthis Tuesday to meet schoolgirls taking part in GETSET. The two day\nevent, part of National Science\nWeek, aimed to encourage more\nwomen into science and engineering.\nThe GET SET projects were\nbased on the film 'Jurassic Park',\nand over 300 girls, aged 13 and 14,\nspent two days working in teams on\nprojects ranging from dinosaur rescue missions to taking a dinosaur's 'pulse'.\nThe challenges were designed by\nCREST (Creativity in Science and\nTechnology) with the aid of children' sTV presenter Johnny Ball.\nFemale mentors from industry and\nacademia were on hand to provide\nthe girls with help and guidance in\nsolving the problems.\nMr Waldegrave, when awarding\nprizes to the most innovative teams,\nsaid: \"So many people only think of\ntext-book bashing when they think\nof science, but the young people\nhere today have shown an alto get h discussing the implications of\ngenetic engineering, including the\ncurrent trails of synthetic ha emo g lo bin, designed to reduce the risk of\nAIDS. \"If it works it will do away\nwith the risk of infection that blood\ntransfusion now carries,\" said Dr\nPerutz.\nThe Schrbdinger Lectures are\nheld annually at Imperial College,\nand previous lecturers have included Stephen Hawking and Benoit\nMandelbrot.\ner different side to science: the\nexciting, innovative side which is\nwhat science is like in the real\nworld.\"\nDuring his visit, Mr Waldegrave\nalso saw some of the research carried out at the College, such as\nwork using neurotoxins to treat\nmovement disorders by Professor\nOliver Dolly of the Biochemistry\nDepartment. While there, he spoke\nto some schoolgirls who were testing 'dinosaur' blood as part of\nGET SET. Simple biochemistry\nexperiments let the girls learn about\nlab work and diagnostic tests. One\ngirl said she'd really enjoyed the\nexperiments, and \"hadn't realised\nscience could be so much fun\".\nIn an interview with Felix, Mr\nWaldegrave stressed the importance\nof events like GETSET in encouraging interest in science amongst\nwomen. He said: \"We are wasting\nnearly half our population.\" He\nwent to say that the drive to get\nmore women in science and engineering should not be a \"one off\nthing\" but \"has got to be long term\nand it has got to be continuous\".\nDismissed?\nIn issue 991 of Felix we stated that\nCarolyne Osner was the Sports\nCentre Manager at the time of its\nrefurbishment. We would like to\nacknowledge that Pamela Thomas\nwas the Manager at the time and\nCarolyne Osner was the College\nSports and Leisure Manager.\nCurrently, Pamela Thomas is\ntaking legal action against the\nCollege for her alleged unfair dismissal in September 1993.\nBreathing Molecules\nThe last UGM of term is today at 1 pm in the Ents Lounge\n\n"

No mention of the almost daily 'lone\nincidents' in which innocent women and\nchildren are attacked without discrimination. It\nis perhaps worth pointing out that the 1929\nmassacre by a mob of 'lone deranged people'\nleft Hebron Judenrein for the only time in\nthousands of years.\nIt would be well to reflect that although this\nincident has received well publicised\ncondemnation by Jewish leaders, secular and\nreligious, both here and abroad, the silence from\nother communities when their 'lone deranged\npeople' act is quite deafening.\nYours faithfully,\nA.N.

I will admit that my letter last week was\nformulated on the basis of a superficial\nimpression, and only after I had re-read it, did I realise that I had taken the very aggressive end\nof the stick. But I feel justified in doing this\nbecause if I got this impression by a first glance,\nI'm sure there were others who, skimming\nbriefly through the letters pages may have\nthought similarly, so my words were of well-meaning caution, not of accusation.\nIn my final message of the term to any\nhumanity which still exists at IC I would like to\nsuggest a definition of tolerance. All of us are\nprejudiced to an extent, most of us resting\nsomewhere comfortably between the extremes of\nintolerant suspicious bigot and naive trusting\nfool. Now I believe that peoples' characters are a true reflection of their environment: if our\nenvironment makes us hostile and cynical, we\ntend to behave in this way to others, and thus the\nprocess is self-perpetuating, but it need not be:\nThe cycle can be broken.\nWhat I think is important for us to find are\nthe points in our lives where our ch-ch-changes\nfrom childhood innocence to cynicism occur,\nand identify if possible, the reasons for them.\nCertainly from his rhetoric, it would appear that\nMarcus has passed beyond this point of no-return and become the battle-hardened cynic that\nhe is. But whilst he might \"hold little faith in the\nfuture of the world\" I have faith in his (and\nevery individual at IC's) potential to do a lot of\nI have since heard that the editors and the\nstaff of the RSMU office have been subjected to\nconsiderable verbal abuse and intimidation by\nseveral large groups of Islam Soc members,\nprotesting about the content of the last Pit\neditorial.\nIt is my view that this sort of behaviour only\ngoes to prove that the editors were correct to\nremind their readers that there is a significant\nminority in this country and this College, who\nopenly advocate murder, and have scant regard\nfor the law.\ngood with his life, rather than to spread gloom\nand doom as he is doing currently.\nIn response to his suggestion that I remove my\nblinkers, I should like to tell Marcus that my eyes\nhave never been open so widely. I have lived in\nWarrington and walked the very street on which\nJohn Ball and Tim Parry were killed and each day\nin the media I see and hear of the most terrible\natrocities committed by people against each other\nin the name of nationalism, greed or pure malice.\nBut I am not going to throw up my hands in\nthe air and say: \"Well, that's life and there's nothing I can do about it.\" Because there is\nsomething we can all do about it, which doesn't involve marching through streets or shouting\ninto the wind: Simply to think a little about\nourselves and about others.\nSo I approach the end of this letter, and\nhopefully the end of this vigorously and on the\nwhole intelligently fought debate, which began\nso many aeons ago when Marcus started the ball\nrolling with his cry that despite IC supposedly\nlaying claim to the top x% of the population of\nthis country, it has degenerated into a \"wasteland of mindlessness\". I too find it tragic\nto know that we are amongst some of the finest\nbrains in the country, who may become\ntomorrow's managers and leaders with the\npower to influence people's lives and futures,\nyet many of us will, by the time we have left\ncollege, have truly become detached from the\nreality of our one life on this planet. If we, as\nstudents do not think about these issues now,\nonce we embark on our career-oriented lives\nproper it will be too late.\nYours sincerely,\nSagar Das, Chem Eng 3\nI sincerely hope that the new Government\nrules on Student Union expenditure on clubs and\nsocieties exclude groups such as Islam Soc, who\nso blatantly abuse the freedoms guaranteed them\nby democratic constitutions; freedoms that\nwould not be available to, for instance, a Christian Society at a university in an Islamic\ncountry.\nYoursfrom a safe house in South Kensington,\nAnthony France, Civ Eng III.\nP.S.

Following\ntheir best-ever results at Reading Head, the\nCollege's top two mens' eights were asked by\nOxford University to participate in some\nsharpening work on Wednesday 16th. The Blue\nBoat got cold feet and shamefaced ly pulled out\non the day but the ISIS (Oxford's reserves) - IC\nII match remained 'on' despite virtual North Sea\nconditions. The first two three-minute rows\nprovided such emphatic margins of victory for\nImperial's young crew that the scheduled third\nrow was declined by the Oxford camp, while IC\nwere sent straight to their makeshift boat house gym by coach Bill Mason to complete a weights\nsession!\nA good result for the College oarsmen, but\nalso a reminder that whilst they can now expect\nto compete with a beat such famous teams, the\nlatter receive daily press coverage and millions\nof pounds of sponsorship in comparison with the\nvery welcome but hopelessly inadequate funds\ntheir lower profile brings them. The club was\nvery grateful for the new minibus it desperately\nneeded but those rowers who will be\nrepresenting the College at a regatta in\nBarcelona in April before their training camp on\nthe '92 Olympic rowing course have to find the\nmoney for this almost entirely from their own\npockets.\nThis will be brought again into stark focus\nnext weekend - the Boat Race will be watched\nby hundreds of millions worldwide, but it is only\ncoincidentally because of this event, essentially\nirrelevant to the rowing world, that the far more\nimportant Head will be televised. Yet the\nstandard of this 420-boat race belies its paltry\ncoverage: Imperial's first boat is aiming to retain\nits Top Five position but this must be put into\nperspective: The probable winners and No. One\ncrew are Hansa Dortmund, the World\nChampions from Germany and the next four\nslots will be filled by boats with reigning\nOlympic and World Champions on board. IC's second eight look set for a Top 15 placing which\nwould secure them the U AU Championshipsurely the only college club second team capable\nof claiming aU AU title?\nAt the moment, student rowing in general is\nso far ahead of all but the top three or four clubs\nthat this represents a real achievement. The Boat\nClub also has a real chance to better the record it\nset in 1992 of four separate titles and to have\nfour eights in the Top 50 finishers. So expect to\nsee your College heavily featured on\nGrandstand: The rowers will be giving\neverything and hoping for some tangible results\nfor their efforts.\nStudent\nAccommodation Office\nVacancies in College Residences\nas at 21/3/94\nRef Hall Type Sex UG/PG From Licence\n1.

    "content": "Reviews 25\nFuton And Daruma\nDespite it's techno-smart modern exterior, Japan\nhas often been stagnant when it comes to female\nemancipation (yes, still). As chronicled in films\nlike 'Ripples of Change', any mould-breaking\nenergy seems to have faded; previously bra-burning feminists of the 70s lib movement\nappear a tragic shadow of their former selves;\nnow only bitter cynicism and Catch-22\nresignation remain. Why? Weakness or\nignorance is not the problem; more likely is the\ntenacious hold of traditional feudal values -epi tomis ed by the conformity of mainstream\nsociety and it's resentment to 'rogue' elements.\nSuch is the unseen background context to\nRyo Iwamatsu's 'Futon and Daruma', presented\nhere by WaVe. Set in a room with two futons,\nthe farc i al( and often sexual) comings-and-goings of the characters form the backbone of\nthe play. The evening after his daughter's wedding, Nomura's mid-life crisis worsens\nwhen his young second-wife suggests they\nseperate. Complications ensue as in-law couples,\ngirl/boyfriend pairs interact in a very sharp\nShavian-like satire. But there is a pressure\ncooker of emotions underpinning the play.\nDramatic tension bubbles to boiling point in\nprolonged silences and makes it almost\nunbearable at times. This is in fact never\ncompletely released and the embracing of a new\nday, right at the end, perpetuates the whole\nsituation to poignant intensity.\nThe set layout is essentially Japanese, and the\ncontent of the dialogue, a satire on said-culture.\nBut with English characters speaking familiar\nvernacular, it could also work as a satire on a more recognisable level.\nThe d arum a is particularly intriguing; it is a small doll used to embody wishes and derives\nit's name from Zen Buddhist founder Dharma.\nUnbelievably coherent, it is also representative\nof (wo)man's essential resilience to the identity-jarring incidents that occur in life - the doll is\nweighted so once knocked over, it bounces back\nup again.\nMaximum credit goes to Edmund Dehn\nwhose articulate Nomura is compelling through-out. Kazuya, played by Alex Harland, is\nunnerving ly funny, and not because there's a scene involving a romp with his wife and a silver vibrator. Esta Jakobs as Nomura's wife is\na little too restrained even for Japanese\nstandards and perhaps needs more charisma.\nTim Keenan's direction is incredibly\ndynamic and it's not hard to see why his WaVe\ncompany are 'committed to producing unusual\nand visually stimulating theatre'. The opening\nfew minutes with Stuart Bedford's film\nbackdrop and Jonathen Allen's 'ambient' station\nsound bites feel like a surreal kaleidoscopic\nhallucination and is almost like a cinematic clip\nfrom 'Mishima'.\nIn the play, the adage that appearances can be\ndeceiving rings very true. Indeed, you can't judge a theatre by looking at it's doorway.\nCamille\nAttic Theatre, 103 The Broadway, SW19. 081\n542 6141. Tube: Wimbledon.

The\nbarman at the Cockpit Theatre didn't help much\neither: \"It's about a paddy who gets whacked,\"\nhe muttered. Expectations were rapidly sinking\n- nearly as quickly as the level of Guinness in\nmy plastic pint cup. But then again, I was\nalways told never judge a theatre by its bar staff. Paddywack deals with one of the most ugly\nscourges of the modern cosmopolitan world\nmany of us now inhabit: racism. Damien, a young Irishman starting work in London, is\ntransformed and projected by each and every\ncharacter he meets into what they want him to\nbe, not what he really is.\nThe motives are all very different - for\nBrian, the token Alf Garnet character, it is\ninsecurity - for Damien's girlfriend, it is the\nthrill of danger. But the projection is the same:\nDamien must be, has got to be...an IRA terrorist.\nAnd you will have probably guessed the fate\nof our poor Damien - the innocent paddy, who\nin an enthralling last scene, finally meets his\nwhack.\nIt is a stirring play indeed, and a poignant\nreminder that we should all be careful of false\nexpectations - for, in the end, it is so easy to\nblame others when you own truth is so hard to\nfind. Get a ticket, and make you own\njudgement...\nThe Judge and Duke\nThe Cockpit Theatre, Gateforth St, NW8. 071\n402 5081. Tube: Marylebone/Edgware Rd. Ends\n26th March.

Despite the friendly\npenguin pictures, the flimsy cardboard box\nmakes it difficult to open without ripping it.\nThe egg itself is made of white chocolate,\nwhich is unfortunately \"not as nice as a milky\nbar\". It breaks apart with a \"rather satisfying\npop\", revealing a small packet of dolly\nmixtures, which were snapped up in a matter of\nseconds. When questioned, the reviewers\nresponsible declared them to be \"really nice\".\nPenguin, perhaps understandably, was a big\nfan of this egg. For the price, the fun, sweets and\nheated debate on the packaging, are hard to beat.\nPackaging 5\nValue for Money 7\nTaste 5\nPoached Egg\nGalaxy Truffle Eggs\n\u00a31.99\nThis isn't really a traditional egg: it's twenty\nlittle sweets stuffed into a transparent tube. The\ntube itself was mostly admired (\"long, long,\nlong\") and was noted for its re usability( currently it is holding chopsticks).\nThe sweets themselves were chocolate truffle\nellipsoid s with a hard centre. They were well\nreceived (\"the best tasting mini eggs I 've had\"),\nif \"quite rich.\" The panel also acknowledged\n\"we were strangely worried by the hard bits\".\nThe truffles are not very good value: the\npacket contained twenty eggs, working out at\nlOp per egg. Not recommended, except for\npracticality after the party.\nPackaging 5\nValue for Money 5\nTaste 7\nSmarties Egg\n\u00a31.95\nThis egg looks extremely promising from the\noutside - the \"erm.. sturdy\" box has a toy card\nelephant on the back. A mild flurry of\nexcitement broke out among our reviewers at\nthe chance to \"stick your fingers through an\nelephant's bottom\". (The idea is to use your\nfingers as its legs.)\nSadly, that appears to be the best part of the\nwhole experience. The chocolate egg is \"pretty\nheavy\" with a \"stodgy, traditional\" taste. It does\nstick to your mouth, but was described as\n\"rough and ready - chocolate with stubble\".\nWhiskas would have hated it.\nThe worst part is the bag of smart ies inside\nthe egg: is was terrible. As martie connoisseur\ndescribed the contents as \"sub-standard, smaller,\nflatter, easier to bite through and with a different\ntexture to real smart ies\". Everyone agreed to\nbeing disgusted.\nWe wouldn't recommend this egg, unless the\nshop has run out of real smart ies. To add to the\ndilemma, this is a Nestte product, so you should\nthink twice before buying it.\nPackaging 7\nValue for Money 4\nTaste 5\nDairy Box\n\u00a34.29\nThis is the kind of egg you send to your mum. It\ncomes with a dainty cream bow on the front and\nthe egg is wrapped in flowery blue foil.\nLess tactfully, the egg is quite fat, making it\n\"very good for spinning\". The chocolate is\n\"thick and creamy\", by far the best milk\nchocolate we tested.\nThe sweets inside the egg are strangely\nunmarked: those engaging in \"culinary Russian\nRoulette\" will find standard Dairy Box fare very\nnice but unexceptional.\nPackaging 5\nValue for Money 5\nTaste 8\nQuality Street\n\u00a34.29\nFans of Dairy Box will be pleased to know that\nthe egg is seemingly identical. However, one\nbig difference is in the sweets: they are properly\npackaged Quality Street favourites (fudge,\nhazelnut & caramel, toffee, etc).\nAnother advantage is the packaging: the\nmore low-key approach ensures you won't lose\nyour street c red buying this one.\nOverall, a better egg than Dairy Box.\nEven Mr Bendy hated the sub-standard Smarties\nEggies (Mr Bendy)\n\u00a31.49\nMr Bendy (as he was christened) won our hearts\nand minds immediately. As soon as we saw him\nlying in a heap on the shelf, we just had to have\nhim. A transparent, egg-shaped being with pink\narms and legs that bend. And you even get some\nchocolates inside. Brilliant.\nThe only problem was how to get at the little\nsweets without damaging his torso. Eventually\nwe found a washing machine-like opening at the\nback, cunningly concealed behind a sticker.\nUnfortunately, the chocolates \"look like animal\ndroppings wrapped up\" and taste \"buttery, very\nnice\", \"alright in small quantities\" or \"like\ncac k.\" Despite this, the quality of the sweets doesn't seem to matter. To quote one of the reviewers:\n\"It's the bend y bits that count.\" We think that\nEggies show the way forward in confectionery.\nOne panelist suggested that \"a foot tall Eggie\nfilled with Ferrero Rocher would be near\nperfect\".\nFor the present, though, \"if you can feed the\nchocolate to other people it's righteous\".\nPackaging 10\nValue for Money 6\nTaste 3\nPackaging 6\nValue for Money 4\nTaste 8\nThe Panel\nIvan Chan\nMike Ingram\nJon Jordan\nBeccy Land\nPenguin\nSimon Shaw\nPatrick Wood\n\"Oh no\"\n\"Righteous\"\n\"Hehhehhehhehhehheh''\n\"Hard bit in the middle\"\n\"I really do feel sick\"\n\"Long, long, long\"\n\"Fondling Mr Bendy\"\nSpecial Guest Chompers\nTim St Clair\nJane Hoyle\nRachel Mountford\nLook out for the Felix Cookery Corner next term\n\n"
