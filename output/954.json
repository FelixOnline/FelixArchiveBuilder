    "content": "Feature\n22 January 1993 Felix 954\nThe Lion, the Flower and the\nevening out\nSam H offers us all the opportunity to let our hair down at the Malaysian\nSociety's Hibiscus night...\nOn the 6th February, the Malaysian\nSociety will bring to you an evening\nenriched with the colours of the\nfascinating Malaysian Culture: the\nHibiscus Evening. The programme\nincludes a variety of entertainment\nand the guests will also be treated\nto Malaysian delicacies, especially\nprepared for the occasion. Of the\nhighlights of the evening are two\nsketches of totally different themes\nand background. To wet your\nappetite, allow me to sneak a few\nkittens out of the bag...\nThe first sketch evolves around\na young immigrant named Ah Chan\nwho flees from a crumbling and\npoverty-stricken China in search of\na better life at the turn of the\ncentury. Ah Chan represents\nmillions of others like him who had\nembarked in hordes on hazardous\njourneys to foreign lands with only\nhope and rigid faith to guide them.\nThe story proceeds to describe the\nnew life of Ah Chan in the British\nMalaya and his struggle to\novercome numerous barriers in\ncarving out a living for himself with\nhis bare hands. Beneath this rags to\nriches theme is a deeper and more\npersonal message which expresses\nthat many people don't seem to be\naware of: the ancestors of the\nMalaysian Chinese (and of\nAmerican Chinese, Jamaican\nChinese, South African Chinese,\nIndian Chinese, etc) went through\nhell to establish themselves and to\nbe accepted into foreign societies.\nIn the beginning, immigrants and\nnatives led separate and segregated\nlives. However, with the eruption\nof World War 2 and Japanese\noccupation, both sides began to\nrealise that unity was their only\nstrength against Japanese\nImperialism and that they had to\nwork together regardless of colour\nand creed. This led to a new\nappreciation and meaning to the\nMalaysian identify.\nMoving on to the second sketch,\nwe have a simple and romantic tale\nabout a group of young people who\nfall in and out of love and then find\ntrue happiness once again in the\narms of the person of their dreams.\nYes, this is a classic fairy tale with\na happy ending where the good\nguys always win and the bad guys\nturn out to be wimps. I won't tell\nyou more, the moral of the story?\nWell, one shouldn't fool around\nwith one's own heart and mess with\nother peoples'. In some games, we\nsimply have to play by the rules,\njust like we cannot play snooker\nwith a tennis ra que t \u2014 as there are\ntoo many strings attached. And to\nmany hard-crusted lager louts\ncomrades out there, we all know\ncorny stuff ain't good for the\nimg age, but hey, what the heck!\nJust give the pub a miss for the\nnight. It's all for a laugh.\nEveyone on the production team\nare working very hard to make the\nsketches as well as the show a success. Obviously, we cannot\npromise you any seductive wench\noozing with sex appeal who could\nalways count on her basic instincts.\nWe do not have any cute eleven\nyear old kid who outsmarts bandits\nwhen he is alone at home or in New\nYork. There isn't any tough muscle\nman terminator who blows your\nbrains out with a lethal weapon after\ngreeting you with the famous words\n'has ta la vista, baby'. What we have\nis an invitation for you to come and\nsee the show. Our ambitious lot\nintend to give you a good time.\nNow that you have got a glimpse of\nwhat lies in wait, do come along.\nWe really do have some goodies in\nstore for you, please don't hesitate\nto join us. All are welcome.\nwith the unique chance to see the Northern Lion Dance.\nThe Northern Lion Dance is among\nthe most popular of what were\ncalled 'Imitation Performances' in\nancient China in which acrobats in\ncostume imitate animals.\nThe Lion's head is made of\npainted papier mac he while its coat\nis woven silk and hemp (or yak's hair for stage performances). The\nlarger lion\u2014which shakes its head,\nwags its tail and rolls on the ground\nis played by two acrobats, one\nstanding in front to control the head\nand the other bending over to\ncontrol the body. This may seem no\nbig deal at first sight; in practice,\nit has proved to be very physically\ndemanding, requiring skill and\nstamina. The front acrobat, for\nexample, despite his poor vision\n(due to structural hindrance) has to\nbrandish the lion head, which\nweighs several kilograms, to the\ncorrect sequence throughout the\nshow. It is an equally hard task for\nthe performer at the back, for he\nmay suffer from breathing\ndifficulties due to his prolonged\nbent posture. Besides, some\nmovements could involve a high\ndegree of difficulty. For example,\nthe 'Shuang Fei', with the\nassistance from the back, the front\nacrobat has to jump to a height of\naround two metres above the\nground before executing a flying\nkick in the air. The back acrobat\nthen has to hold him in the position\nand literally move him forward for\nalmost one metre before returning\nhim to the ground. In recent years,\nacrobats have expanded the lion's repertoire with feats which include\ntreading a ball across a seesaw and\nstanding on stacked benches\u2014acts\nwhich display the brave, lively and\nplayful character of the lion through\nhigh acrobatic skill.\nLion dance skill, unlike other art\nforms, could not be self-cultivated\n(say by reading)\u2014it can only be\npassed on by a coach who is himself\nan experienced acrobat. Indeed, it\nis with such thought in mind that the\nNorthern Lion Dance Troupe of the\nMalaysian Chinese Society UK was\napproached. Being the first of its\nkind in this country, it has been\ninvited to perform on many\noccasions, including on Channel\nFour two years ago.\nAfter a significant period of\nvigorous practice, the IC lads are\nnow ready to perform in the\n'Hibiscus Evening', organised by\nthe Malaysian Society on the 6th February. Don't miss it!\nPage 10\n\n"

In a statement to Felix\nPaul Thomas, the RCS president\nsaid, 'Based on the number of\ntickets that we sold, we were very\nlikely to make a loss by continuing\non and running the dinner.\nHowever, cancelling it would have\nmade less of a loss'.

In a letter published in this\nmorning's Felix, Mr Davidson tells\nMr Beavan to 'keep up the good\nwork, Robert Maxwell would be\nproud of you.'\nThe row centres on a front page\nreport in last week's Felix, which\nsaid that Mr Davidson invited\nmembers of the University of\nLondon General Union Council\n(GUC) to join in a breakaway\ncouncil with himself as chairman.\nThe article also details allegations\nmade by two London University\nsabbaticals, who said that Mr Davidson was drunk when he made\nthis 'breakaway' call. In the same\narticle, Mr Davidson denied the\nallegations, saying that he was\ndefinitely not drunk.\nThe Felix article was raised at last\nMonday's meeting of Imperial\nCollege Union Council. Mr Davidson said that the Felix story\nwas inaccurate, and that Gareth\nLight, Felix News Editor, had\nFelix 954\neven killed in similar accidents on\nfield trips.\nDr P Garrard, Department of\nGeology's Fieldwork Officer, told\nFelix that it is of utmost importance\nto the department and College that\nstudents are equipped with training\npacks and kept under the watchful\neye of trained staff until they gain\ntheir own confidence and\nexperience in outdoor situations.\nalso pointed out that the loss was\nfurther lessened by the hotel kindly\nrefunding the deposit for the event.\nWhen asked about the RCS May\nBall, Mr Thomas said that the\ncancellation of the Annual Dinner\nwould have no effect on the ball\nwhich will be held on 8th May at\nSilwood Park.\nAccountants ( FCC A) and a graduate of the University of\nStirling, where he read\nTechnological Economics with\nChemistry.

A suggestion by Mr Davidson that the\nmatter should be closed was\nobjected to by Rhian Picton,\nBiochemistry Departmental\nRepresentative. Ms Picton\nsuggested that Mr Davidson write\na letter to Felix, recording the\narticle's alleged inaccuracies. The\nletter is on page four.\nMr Davidson was also asked\nabout the article in his Presidential\nNew Year interview on IC Radio.\nMr Davidson said that the article\nwas not true, and pointed to the\nother members of the Imperial\nCollege Union GUC delegation, all\nof whom, according to Mr Davidson, agree that the President\ndidn't call for a breakaway council.\nMr Davidson added that me article\nwas 'printed in a way that makes it\nlook inflammatory', and that it\ndidn't help his relationships with the\nUniversity of London Union\n(ULU).\nT maintain what I did say was we\nshould look at UL U, because we\nspend a lot of time at GUC.

Professor Michael\nBesser said that the reports in three\nSunday newspapers were the result\nof a leak 'high up' in the\nDepartment of Health, but added\nthat he could not confirm or deny\nthe reports.\nBart's Hospital was one of five\nLondon hospitals earmarked for\nclosure when the Tomlinson Report\nwas published late last year.

That's it. I didn't say we should set\nup a breakaway council,' said Mr Davidson.\nWhen told that Felix insisted their\nstory came from two London\nUniversity sabbaticals, Mr Davidson said, 'if they did or they\ndidn't, that's entirely up to them.'\nHe added that he 'got quite annoyed\non Friday (15 January)', and\ncontinued, 'when I get a story like\nthat on the front page, I do question\nthe money we pay for this (Felix)'.\nT think we should keep a free and\nindependent press at the College,'\nsaid Mr Davidson, though he\ndeclined to say whether he thought\nICU should continue to pay for\nFelix, as he said he didn't want to\npreempt the work of the Working\nParty on ICU structure.\nOn other subjects, Mr Davidson\nsaid that the job of ICU President\nwas not as he initially thought it\nwould be. He added that he thought\nof himself more 'as a managing\ndirector rather than a president'.\nCommenting on the continuing ICU\nsite. London's nine medical schools\nwere also to be merged onto four\nsites, with Imperial chosen as the\nsite for a new expanded medical\n'suf er school' comprising St Marys\nMedical School, Charing Cross,\nWestminster Medical School, the\nInstitue of Cancer Research, the\nNational Heart and Lung and\nInstitue and the Royal Postgraduate\nMedical School.\nAn announcement on the\nimplementation of the report by\nVirginia Bottomley, the Health\nSecretary, has been delayed until\nthe middle of next month, while\nJohn Major, the Prime Minister,\nstudies position papers prepared by\nMrs Bottomley, on the subject\nIn an interview with Felix, Mr Calvi stressed that students should\nnot feel that they are the only ones\nto experience problems with\nrevision and exams, and that they\nshould 'spend time on emotional\npreparation', rather than\nconcentrating solely on the\nacademic side of things.\nContact one of the Health Centre\nreceptionists on ext. 3099, or call\nin to 15 Prince's Gardens for\nfurther details.\nOrganisational Review, the\nPresident said that there was no\nforum to openly assess student\nopinion. 'Our organisation doesn't meet that,' he said. The purpose of\nthe review was to decide what\nstudents want from a students'\nunion, and he had no skeletons in\nthe cupboard. 'I'm trying to avoid\nthe implication that I have\nsomething to hide. I'm not out to\nget anybody', Mr Davidson said.\nThe President said that ICU 'is\nhaving an input into how voluntary\nmembership is proceeding,' though\nhe added that he thought the\nimplementation of voluntary\nmembership had 'been stalled at the\nmoment'. 'I don't think it will go\nmuch further this parliamentary\nsession,' he continued.\nOn a possible d is affiliation of\nImperial College from the\nUniversity of London, Mr Davidson said that students should\nnot lose out 'if everybody is mature\nabout it'.

It would have been\neasy to ignore these and concentrate\non the meaning of the play, but\nsince the focus of the play was\nlargely about freedom, these typical\ningredients were vital to help\nconvey the struggle for freedom that\nwas faced.\nThe cast are flawless, with each\nthespian performing at least three\nroles and some requiring the\naddition of make-up or a total\nchange of clothes that was put on\nwith all speed.

We wobbled through the\nearly morning London may-hem\nthat August morning and choked\nand spluttered our way into Victoria\nStation to check in. The desks were\ndeserted although smart buttoned\nstaff were milling around.\nIt was 7.05am when we started\nto dismantle the bikes. Twenty\nminutes later the job was complete\nand we lugged everything round to\nthe other counter.\n'I'm sorry,' said the cheery BA voice, 'but luggage for that flight\nhas already left - we're not taking\nany more - you'll have to hurry to\ncheck in at Gatwick.'\nI was stunned. How could ten\nmonths of planning be foiled so\neasily? In a frenzied, heart\npounding sweat we hurled bikes and\nbags onto a waiting train. Our new\nhope of still making the flight was\ndashed when the guard spotted the\ndismantled bikes in the corridor and\nforcibly evicted us with threats of\ncalling the police to counteract my\nfurious protests.\n'There's another train going in\nfifteen minutes,' she smirked as she\nflounced off down the platform.\nThe guard's van was bare and\nsecond class crowded. It was a horribly fraught journey down to\nGatwick - uncertainty mounting\nwith our frustration. The north\nterminal lay a further monorail\njourney away and by the time we\nreached the check-in desk it was just\nten minutes before the flight was\ndue to leave.\n'So there you are,' said the\ncheery voice. 'We thought you\ndidn't want to go,' smiled a hostess\nas we stumbled aboard. 'It's been\na bad day,' I replied as I slumped\ninto a seat over the wing. Andrea\nand Stephane found window seats.\nThe child-like glee of flying for the\nfirst time overwhelmed Andrea,\nwho sat fidgeting in her seat.\nStephane submerged himself in a financial magazine and I in a guide\nbook.\nGibraltar was hot and bothered -with tiny clogged streets - a mixture\nof English seaside town and\nMediterranean holiday resort. The\noil fires burnt bright and sooty in\nthe bay and cranes bowed low about\nthe monstrous limestone hulk that\nis Gibraltar. We shopped and\npeddled around before heading out\ntowards Algiceras and our gateway\nto Morocco.

In\nthe rock 'n' roll hall of fame is\nanything higher than the cover of\n'Rolling Stone' magazine? So what\nyou've never heard of them. Life\nis full of discovery as you might\nfind out one day. Their US debut\nLP 'Pocket Full of Kryptonite' has\nfinally reached million selling\nstatus, and single 'Little Miss Can't Be Wrong' is top 30 and the most\nrequested radio song on A OR stations.\nFirmly embedded in the roots-orientated Deadhead touring scene,\nthe Spin Doctors took over a year\nto build up popular momentum to\ntheir eclectic homegrown groove.\nInitital album sales were only\n60,000, but the cross-over\nexplosion occurred, and it is being\nreleased in Britain followed by a tour.\nPrior to that invest in 'Little\nMiss'; get a taste. It kicks off with\nan undulating blues background,\nsoon interwoven with the\ninfectiousness of the southern\nboogie. The story is simple, Boy\nand Girl an' all that jazz but add that\nmagic touch and even that's pale table. Then experience the\nspaced-out experience of 'forty or\nfifty' and hunker down to the\npearl jamming 'refrigerator car'.\nRemember a million Americans\ncan't always be wrong.\nAs the Spin Doctors say 'Our\nsound just kind of revealed itself to\nus. Like some kind of crazy\nsandwich that's exponential...'\nTintin\nSuperchunk - The Question\nis how Fast\nA lively, enthusiastic piece of guitar\npop with an easily remembered\nsing along chorus 'The Question is\nhow Fast' will be rapidly lapped up\nby any competent indie bop kid.\nHowever whether it recites the tale\nof the tortoise racing and beating the\nhare, or of the dilemmas of the\nvirgin contemplating the rapid\nmovements of the lover, I have no\nidea. Whatever the lyrics are about,\nthe guitars and distorted vocal\nharmonies combine for attractive\nlistening. On the flip appears the\nmore frantic, but of a similar\nnature- 'Forged it' and '100000\nfireflies', the latter telling of how\nthe Superchunkies wanted to kill\nthemselves on the front lawn after\ntroubled dreams of unrequited love.\nEverything a pop song should be.\nRalph.\nMadness, The Farm, 808\nState Edinburgh 21st Dec\nWhen I read who was supporting I was even more bemused than on\ndiscovering Morrissey was at the\noriginal reunion gig in August\nwhere his fans where outnumbered\n100 to 1 and he was consequent al ely given a less than friendly\nreception.Here there was a generous spread of r avers and\npseudo indie-phil es throughout the\nbarn of the Ingleston centre. We\nmissed 808 state on account of the\npublic transport to within a mile and\na half being non-existent but had\nplenty of time to get near the stage\nfor The Farm, phe wee. They\nplayed a selection of their many\nexcellent songs including \"Groovy\ntrain\", \"Groovy train\"\nand..erm..\"Groovy train (remix?)\"\nall of which played backwards\nreveal the subliminal message\n'' PARC, PARC, PARC..\". Apparently Suggs is no longer managing\nthem but the Mads must owe them\nsomething. How else do you\nexplain a band that gets mud thrown\nat it at lunchtime at Reading being\nsupported by one that headlines the\nlast day on Glastonbury's NME stage? \"Our guitarist seems to be\nhaving some problems\"...he can't play? \"Here's one for all you\nnaughty boys and naughty girls out\nthere\".. .vomit. The realisation that\nHooton \"dances\" just like a chemist I once went out with raised\na smile but for those who found no\nrede a ming features a fight was the\nonly outlet. The security was as\ndisorganised as the gangs were\norganised and although, at least\naround us, the \"wave of fear\" was\nonly of Madness not coming on nine\npeople did go to hospital and\n' \"hundreds\", I read in the Scotsman\nthe next day, left early. Madness\nmay, to quote the Big Issue, be\nmaking the greatest comeback in\nrock history, (though I rather doubt\nit), but the shit venue and lack of\nimpressive light show due to the\ncrowd lights being left on after the\nfighting were making the chances\nof this maintaining the standard set\nat Finsbury Park slim. The audience\nwas relieved and ecstatic when they\ndid finally take the stage and as all\nand one roared the intro to \"One\nstep beyond\" for many the moment\nthey'd waited all their lives for had\nfinally arrived...well it was jolly\nexciting.\"This is the heavy,heavy\nmonster sound...the nuttiest sound\naround..\" bellowed Chas Smash\ndressed in top hat and tails.Too\nfuckin' right! Three minutes later\nthe frenzy subsides and Lord Suggs\nsmoothly utters the magic words\nfrom their debut single \"The\nPrince\" - \"Buster,he sold the\nheat...with a rock steady beat...\"\nHere we go again. They rapidly\nplough through about 16 songs all\ntaken from Divine Madness.Clearly\nthis was aimed more at the new fans\nthan the hardcore following.\nBetween the songs from '79 to '86\nwas a casual but still fresh repartee.\n\" My name is Suggs and I'm not\nvery funky\" spake the oracle before\ncavorting across the stage using his\numbrella as a third leg to help pull\nLee \" K ix\" Thompson out of the\ncrowd he's been swinging on a rope\nover, with the same carefree ease\nas when he climbed the lighting\ngantry when the Nutty Boys played\nhere at the Freshers\nball.Particularly good were \"It\nmust be love\" and \"Grey day\"\nwith its eerie instrumental. There\nwas just the one encore of \"House\nof fun\" and the culmination of the\nset,\"Baggy trousers\" with K ix doing the legendary flying\nsaxophonist bit over the stage. O.K. the play list has been cut by half a dozen songs since the original\ncomeback and the idea that \"none\nof them are in it for the money\"\nseems a bit hopeful but they still\nplay a damn good show and as the\nmasses trudged off through the\nsnow there was a feeling that what\nthey'd just witnessed was something\nspecial and something that in years\nto come they'd have kicked\nthemselves for not making the effort\nto go and see.\nHuey, Lewey and Dewey\nTick, Trick und Track\nOle, Dole og Doff en\nFi Fi, Mi Mi and Wee Wee\n\u2014For the benefit of the European\nCommunity.\nPage 1 7\n\n"

Once we arrived at\nGuildford we were pleased to find\nthat they had six substitutes and so\nwe were able to borrow a winger\n- whom incidentally played better\nthan his opposite man. The rest of\nour backs had a tremendous game\nwith an early, converted, try from\nStu Caterall. They didn't really\ncome back after that. An early\npenalty scored, as usual, by Lee\nJefferson, gave us a three point\nbuffer to work within. Dominance\nwas re confirmed in the second half\nwith a try from Dave of Surrey Uni,\nthe only un converted one, and later\nwith a try from Adam Wood\nfollowed within seconds by another\nstorming run and try by Tim\nSavigar.\nThe forwards flourishing back play\nwas probably due to the inspiration\nof having a winger as second row.\nMatt Good, John Cassidy and John\nRoebuck were everywhere on the\npitch and Si Fuller and Mark\nJackson did a good job of\nintroducing Glenn Khoo to the\nposition of hooker.

If anyone\nremembers I'd love to know.\nWhatever happened to aunt Flo and\nthe frog with the really thin legs?\nOr for that matter Bagpuss?\nAnd talks to Geoffery Hayes about the end of an era.\nTo delve deeper into the Rainbow\nlegend, I spoke to Geoffrey Hayes,\nknown simply as Geoffrey to\nmillions of children, who has hosted\nRainbow, since it began in August\n1973. Speaking from the\nHippodrome in Bristol where he is\nin pantomime with the affable trio,\nI attempted to find out why the\npublic response has been so strong.\nQ: What do you think has made\nRainbow last for so long?\nA: Well, I think the children liked\nit because it was a bit different. The\nshow touched on social issues and\nsocial manners etc...in a teaching\nway but fun, which is not really\ndone very much in other\nprogrammes. You had the regular\ncharacters who were always up to\nsomething that particular day. We\nbecame part of a family in a way.\nQ: Has there been swell in the\nattendance at shows since the news\nabout Rainbow?\nA: Well I don't know really, people\ntend to book well in advance.. .but\nit does seem to have stirred interest\naround here. Someone has been\norganising a petition which\neveryone's been signing when they\ncome to do the show.\nQ: How are the others, (Zippy and\nco), taking to the idea that when the\npantomime finishes at the end of the\nmonth there might be no Rainbow\nto go back to?\nA: Well they're not very happy\nabout it really... They're all a bit\nbewildered by it all.\nQ: How do you see Rainbow's chances now?\nA: Well, I haven't got any inside\ninformation...nobody tells me\nanything; but I'm a bit more\noptimistic now it's all sunk in.\nWe're all just going along with\nThames. I think Children's TV just\nhas a bad relationship within\nbroadcasting. You see Thames has\nmanaged to sell all their big\nnumbers because they make money.\nWith 'This is Your Life' and 'The\nBill' they can get a lot of money for\n9m Jgfl|||HJW\nIB HH HH HRH r \u2022\n^ ~ : :\n| MH B|H HH HB' bring in a lot of money.\nQ: Have you got any alternative\narrangements for the future should\nthe campaign fail?\nA: Well hopefully the plan is to get\nback on the road as a stage show\nalthough nothing definite has been\nfixed up yet. Whatever comes along\nreally...or we might just split up\nand do different things.. .maybe go\nfor straight acting jobs...I don't know.'\nIt would seem quite a transition\nfrom potato printing to the cut and\nthrust of drama. Perhaps Eldorado\nthe advertising space, which just\nisn't the case with children's programmes.\nQ: Do you think it's a case of the TV bosses not caring about Children's TV?\nA: Well, I don't think they do care\nas much...it's an accountants\nworld...it's money that talks these\ndays. It's probably a generalisation\nand I'm sure there are people in the\nbusiness who are committed, but\nthere are others who'd happily see\nthem replaced by game shows\nwhich cost very little to make but\nwould make a suitable stepping\nstone for Bungle? No? Well if you\nfeel that Rainbow's demise would\nbe another nail in the coffin for\nquality television then come to the\nFelix office to find out how to get\nin touch with Jacquie Doyle-Price\nand Co. There must be somebody\nout there who would like to be\nremembered at this World famous\nseat of learning for something. Why\nnot for establishing 'Rainbow\nSoc.'? Sisters of Zippy, Brothers of\nBungle, The Save Rainbow\nCampaign implores you!!\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 954\nUnion\n22 January 1993\nAs much as you can drink\nThe sports centre is actually run by\nthe College, not the Union, but I thought it would be informative to\nprovide some details on the new\npricing structure.\nWith the long awaited opening of\nthe sports centre imminent (we\nhope) - It is now due to open in mid\nFebruary - the new prices have been\nset. Believe it or not, entry prices\nhave gone down! A swim & gym\nwill cost you 75p compared with\n80p before. The previous 80p charge was a combination of a30p fee to get into the centre and 50p for use of the facilities. Entry fees\nto the sports centre itself have now\nbeen dispensed with for staff and\nstudents.\nThe idea behind the new pricing\nstructure is that people should pay\nfor what they use. Those wishing\nto use the pool or the gym\nexclusively will no longer have to\npurchase a swim & gym ticket.\nThey will only pay 50p.A further change is the\nintroduction of off-peak periods to\nencourage students to make use of\ngaps in their timetables and use the\nsports centre when it is quiet.\nDuring these periods, 9am to 12pm and 2pm to 5pm, also 9pm onwards\nand weekends, entrance to the pool\nor gym will be 40p, with swim &\ngym at 60p. 'Too good to be true' I hear you\nsay. Not quite. You will have to use\nthe sports centre more than once a week to take advantage of the\nseason tickets. Last year the season\nticket price for swim & gym was\n\u00a325. Students were only charged\n\u00a318 as it was anticipated that the\ncentre would be closed for the latter\npart of the year. As we all know the\nrefurbishment took place later than\nplanned, so this was not the case.\nThis year the proposed price for a9 month (academic year) ticket for\nswim & gym was \u00a348. We thought\nthis was excessive and after a lot of\nfrantic negotiation on the part of\nmyself and other Union\nrepresentatives this has been\nreduced to \u00a333.75 peak and \u00a327 off-peak. The average at \u00a330.38\nreflects an increase of just over \u00a35.\nNo increase is good, but in view of\nthe reduced single entry prices and\nimproved facilities, these charges\nare not horrendously unfair. The\nThis Friday's event; the New Year\nCarnival, is going to be the biggest,\ncheapest, best night out in London.\nFor the giveaway price of \u00a33.50,\nyou've got three top bands, bouncy\nboxing, bar til 2am, disco til 3am and a Happy Hour-and-a Half from\n8.30pm10 pm( all drinks down\n20%).\nThe Headline band upstairs is\nJamiroquai. They're a ten piece\nband (with did ger doo), who are one\nof the top dance bands in the\ncountry at the minute. If you read\nlast week's article then you'll know\nthat they've been playing sell-out\nshows all round the country and\nhave been getting much praise\nwherever they go. They're of the\nsame ilk as The Brand New Heavies\nand James Taylor Quartet and\nthey're loud and groovy.\nSupport band are The Friends of\nHarry. They'll be playing their own\nblend of rag g let a gg le pop and\nthey'll have your body moving in\nways it never has before.\nDownstairs in the Union Lounge\nare 3 'A Minutes, who'll be playing\nindie-rock gems. They've\nsupported the likes of Suede and\nKingmaker and they'll soon be huge\nin their own right.\nThere'll be two discos running,\nplaying tunes til late. The usual NO\nRE-ADMISSION policy applies.\nREMEMBER, the last two Ents\nevents have sold out. If you don't want to be disappointed, buy your\nticket now (\u00a33.50 adv, \u00a34 on the\ndoor). If this event sells out, there\nwill only be admission with a ticket.\nAndy.\nFRIDAY 29th JANUARY\nBar Extension till 1 am Doors 8 pm, Disco till 2 am\n\u00a33.50 on the door or \u00a33 in advance from ICU or Guilds Office\n\u2022 HP BH^ nHn^ K No, not now darling, lets go to th t gym will be more comprehensively\nequipped and there will be a pool-side Jacuzzi.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n22 January 1993 Felix 954\nCairngorm here we come!\nWhile all sane mortals were\nsleeping off the excesses of\nChristmas week, a dozen fearless\nS&G ers and some mountaineer\ninfiltrators were heading off to the\nhinterland where even the Romans\ndared not tread. To the home of the\noriginal 'Real Man'\u2014not afraid to\ndon a skirt and climb a mountain in\na lOOm ph breeze. Yes! A wild and\nwindy week in the Cairngorm\nmountains near to Aviemore was\nthe prospect.\nIt was a long journey, but light\nrelief was, as always, provided by\nour glorious leader's driving and\nnavigational techique. Our home for\nthe coming week hove into view in\nthe late evening. All mod cons\nincluding a wood burning air-conditioning system (in case the\nambient Oc became stifling).\nDawn on Sunday saw all but the\nmost determined submarine\ncommanders amongst us dead to the\nworld. However periscopes soon\nwent up and a flurry of Gore-Tex,\nfluff ie s,cram pons and ice-axes later\nwe were being frog-marched to\nbattle fitness. Best laid plans...!\nWinds that could have been fuelled\nby Simon's Chili con Carne, beat\nus back to the relative comfort of\nthe hut with not even a single\nMunro in the bag. Epics had been\nlogged by the rest of the group who\nwent to investigate ski lifts at Cairn\nGorm. Cars were being rolled in the\ncar park with gusts of 150mph and\nAuto Glass were rapidly filling the\npubs of Aviemore with their\ncustomers, including ourselves.\nSnow that evening gave some the\nopportunity for moonlit Crosscountry skiing and skid pan\npractise amongst the fallen trees.\nAn alpine start (5.30am) was\nsuggested to make best use of these\nconditions. Pouring rain greeted\nthose who peered out at this time\nand sent them scuttling back to the\nwarmth of their sleeping bags to\nwait for a more godly hour\u2014or at\nleast someone to bring them coffee\nand porridge.\nWhen at last the assembled\ncompany fell in on the lower slopes\nof Ciarn Gorm, a crack squad was\nsent out to conquer the limited\nquantities of vertical ice to be found\narmed only with a pair of ice axes\nand Boadicea style cramp on s. The\nrest braved the spin drift for the\npleasure of throwing themselves\ndown the slopes of long snow fields\nand building snowmen making sure\nthat they returned in good time\nbefore the bar closed. The\nhonourable return of our intrepid\nice climbers came with but one\ncasual it y \u2014the dislocation of our\nleader's shoulder from an 80ft fall\ninto snow.\nAn ambition to get our hands on\nsome ice, despite deteriorating\nweather on Tuesday drove us onto\nthe huge Aviemore ice rink. A certain prescience told us that\npractise of cramp on technique\nwould not be appreciated here.\nThus full body contact speed skating\nraces, that struck fear into the hearts\nof the locals and terror is ed the\ntoddlers, were organised as some\nform of compensation. Hardier\nmembers hired Mountain bikes and\ntore up the highlands and byways\nliberally scattering mud and\nbi mbl ers alike.\nThat evening was marked by the\ndiscovery of that rarest of\nspecies\u2014a decent Scottish pub, with\nmore whiskys than can be imagined\nand more than just a tap of Tartan\nSpecial Brew. Despite our\nindulgence a5.30 start coincided\nwith a reasonable day the next\nmorning, so even the most\ninexperienced of ice climbers set\nout to give it a go. We were accused\nof kitti ng up to climb Annapurna,\nbut this from people who had\nforgotten how to tie onto a rope.\nThe day finished on a high with a bright moon rising in clear skies for\nan interesting final climb.\nBuoyed by our success we were\nup the next morning at 5.30...and\n6.30...and 7.30 each time waiting\nfor a drop in the winds. None came.\nA morning sat around the fire gave\nplenty of time to put the world to\nright from everyones' political point\nof view (and always perfectly\ngentlemanly\u2014honest). A brighter\nafternoon allowed the Rt Hon\nMembers for IC and Oxford Poly\nout to cool off on a quick bim ble and a return to the ice rink. Further\ncasualties resulted from this foray,\nas our treasurer received a broken\nwrist in a rather ambitious\nmanoeuvre, which he treated with\nhis usual stoicism despite an\novernight stay in Inverness hospital.\nHis loss was our gain as that\nevening we were to be treated to\nwhisky and hag gi s,neap s and tat ties followed by lashing s of trifle,\ntastefully served up in a washing-up bowl.\nOn returning from the pub later\nthat night snow had set in with a vengeance and the following morn\n(at a reasonable hour) we went on\nour way to the slopes with a spring\nin our plac cy booted step and a song\non our lips. It was soon wiped off\nby the vicious wind that continued\nto blow spin drift in our eyes, but\nwonderful snow conditions on some\np is tes more than made up for any\ndiscomfort.\nThat final evening, discord set in\namongst the ranks as the 'let's party' faction pitted their wits (or\nrather volume) against the 'I'm knacker ed,I want a quiet drink'\nbrigade. Fortunately not too much\nwas said in the heat of the moment\nto spoil this most enjoyable of\nweeks where some firm friendships\nwere made. Our thanks must go out\nto Phil Wickens for making it such\na success and Simon Gubbins for\nfeeding the starving hordes so well\nwhilst retaining his customary good\nhumour.\nChris 'Jim' Hodge.\nPage 14\n\n"

    "content": "opinion\n22 January 1993\nBeit\nBack\nFeminism has gone too damn far.\nIt has become exactly that which it\nwas originally designed to oppose\ni.e. sexism. It has, instead of\nundermining male chauvinism,\nestablished female chauvinism in an\nattempt to counter it and this, rather\nthan reduce bigotry has only\naugmented it.\nFurther, it has become a more\nextreme form of bigotry than male\nchauvinism is and maybe ever has\nbeen. Do you think that a book\nentitled 'All women are bitches'\nwould go unnoticed by the ever\nincreasing number of female\npressure groups? The air would be\nthick with the screams of complaint,\nperhaps even the claim that such a book would encourage men to go\nout and rape/maim/murder the first\nwomen they encounter. Yet how\nmany men complain, en masse, of\nthe release of a book entitled 'All\nmen are bastards'? I find offensive,\nnot the book itself, but the fact that\na female chauvinist book is accepted\nFelix 954\nwhile even the mere hint of sexism\nin a joke is enough to get it banned\nfrom television.\nAnother example is a charge too\nmany feminists are heard to whine,\nthe accusation that all men are\npotential rapists, a statement which\nI find is comparable in its offensive\ncontent and error one o us nature to\nthe statement 'all women are\nbegging for it and secretly fanta s is e of being raped anyway'. Not only\ndo the vast majority of men find the\nvery notion of rape repugnant but,\nif the national statistics on male\nimpotence are true, a fair\npercentage of men are incapable of\nsexual intercourse of any kind\nwhatsoever.\nFurthermore, few men are keen\non the idea of having sex and not\npleasing their partner; rather, it's one of the most major blows to the\nmale ego. Sex which is not mutually\npleasurable is the domain of the\nfreak, the potential rapist, the\nminority of men.\nNot content with this extreme\nthinking there is a strain of feminists\nwho believe that sex was a male\ninvention to be enjoyed by men and\nthat women have only been tricked\ninto believing that they enjoy it (I am forced, loathed as I am to do so,\nand resort to strong words; I do not\n1\napologise for the statement: 'This\nis a load of bollocks' and hope that\nreader and editor alike will\nappreciate it for what it is\u2014a last\nresort when polite words fail me.).\nI know of as many women with,\nshall we say, nymphomaniac\ntendencies as their male\ncounterparts and, although I don't claim that my personal knowledge\nis representative of the nation as a whole and although I concede that\nstatistics indicate that more women\nare dissatisfied with sex than men,\nto say women don't enjoy sex and\nall men do is nonsense, the raving\nof a sexually frustrated woman.\nWhich brings me (and with the\nsmoothness of a Radio 4 continuity\nannouncer, I thought) to my\nexplanation as to the thoughts held\nby radical feminists.\nWho's ever seen an attractive\nfeminist? This is not a dig at\nfeminists, though God knows they\ndeserve it; I am not being facetious\nbut I am offering a reasonable\nexplanation to the semi-insane\nwitte rings of these bizarre women.\nIs it purely coincidental that the\nsuppositions as to the existence of\nTravelling The Mind!

This affords us a deep\ninsight to their psyche. I suggest\nthat these women, discontent with\ntheir own sex life or indeed lack of\nit, seek to discourage their sisters'\nsexual activities by the use of\npro pog and a and so reduce them to\ntheir own miserable condition in\naddition to reducing the overall\ncompetition for men.\nI believe, however, that I have the\nin t elect u al capacity to realise that\nnot all feminists are what they\nappear. There are many pseudo-feminists masquerading under the\nfeminist front in an attempt to be\nhigh brow; Julie Birchall, Mail on\nSunday columnist, for example,\ncleverly uses this technique of\nberating men for the sake of\nappearing controversial and\nconsequently selling her work and\nher paper. This I find quite tolerable\nand, quite frankly, enjoy reading.\nI therefore recognise the necessity\nto distinguish her 'views' and those\nof her peers from the main body of\nfeminism. She's fairly attractive as\nwell.\nAn interesting\nconversation\nDear Jonty,\nIn your front page article in last\nweeks edition of Felix I think I should point out that there were\nsome ac curacies. Quite remarkable\nI know, and indeed difficult to\nbelieve, but I thought that, to be\nfair, I should highlight this miracle\nof reporting prowess arid skill, so\nthat all our members can be truly\nproud of the astounding feat. Indeed\nI am called Chris Davidson, I am\nImperial College Union's President\nand I was at the General Union\nCouncil at UL U for their last\nmeeting. In the interests of true\nsarcasm I will not mention the rest\nof the report, other than to say that\nthe additional people in the Imperial\ndelegation, did not recall the\nmeeting as in any way resembling\nthe manner it was reported in your\nmost reputable of mini-tabloids.\nKeep up the good work, Robert\nMaxwell would be proud.\nWith kindest regards,\nChris Davidson.\nCareers Info MILK ROUND closing date four is\non Monday 25th January.

Laura Pimentel\nwas attending a private party in the\nEnts lounge. The party was\norganised by students from the\nLycee Francais on the Cromwell\nRoad, who had booked the lounge\nthrough the Union office.\nMile Pimentel became\nunconscious after being violently\nsick in the ground floor toilets of the\nUnion building. An ambulance was\ncalled by College security after\nattempts to revive the girl failed.\nImperial College Union (ICU)\nmembers remained with the student\nuntil medical help arrived.\nParamedics who arrived at the\nscene said that the girl had\nconsumed large amounts of alcohol.\nShe was also believed to be mildly\ncon cussed.

She was later\ndischarged.\nThe party in the Ents lounge was\nstopped, and College and Union\nsecurity evacuated the room. Four\noff-duty Union Stewards assisted in\nthe evacuation. After evacuation,\ngraffiti was noticed on the walls of\nthe Ents lounge, and Ents have\nsince reported a missing smoke\nmachine.\nThe organisers of the party were\nFrench Lycee students who\narranged the event as a private\nfunction. They stressed that there\nwas no connection between the\nparty and the Lycee Francais, and\nthat they invited some other non-Lycee students as guests. The\norganisers also insisted that entry\nwas refused to anyone who was\ncarrying alcoholic substances. A search of the room afterwards\nrevealed large empty bottles of\n'Merrydown' cider, and empty cans\nof 'Strongbow Super' 8% dry cider.\nNeither of these products are sold\nin the two ICU bars.\nThe student's parents were\ninformed of the incident by\ntelephone, and arrived at the Union\nbuilding soon after the arrival of the\nparamedic team. Students at the\nparty expressed shock at the\nincident. College security reported\nthat some students attempted to\nforce re-entry to the Ents lounge\nafter the evacuation. A member of\nCollege academic staff also\nremarked on 'problems' caused by\nICU renting out rooms to other\ncolleges, including the Lycee\nFrancais and Richmond College.\nFrench and German students\noutside the Lycee Building on\nSaturday were also reported to be\nconcerned at the incident. One\nGerman student told Felix reporters\nthat the affair was 'typical of those\nstupid Lycee students'.\nAs a result of the police\nintervention on Saturday night, the\nbar licensing officer telephoned\nMandy Hurford, Union Manager,\non Monday. An internal Union\ninvestigation was held at the start\nof this week, and union stewards\nwere queried about the evening's events. Felix understands that the\npolice accept the French student\nparty was a private affair, and that\nthere was no evidence that ICU bars\nsold alcohol to any of the Lycee\nstudents. The police further accept\nthat the party organisers attempted\nto stop any consumption of alcohol\nin the Ents lounge. Felix has been\ntold that the police and the licensing\nofficer will not be investigating the\nmatter further. ICU sabbaticals\nhave expressed their thanks to the\noff duty Union stewards and other\nstudents who assisted at the\nincident.\nill\nLast week, up to three thousand people joined Teddy Taylor and Norris\nMacwirter in a march on Hyde Park to call for a Maastricht referendum.\nLater Tony Benn spoke and a letter of support from Lady Thatcher was\nread to the assembled crowd, (pic and story Lise Yates.)\nCentre Prices\nby Jacob Andelin\nPrices and dates for the refurbished\nImperial College Sports Centre\nwere finally confirmed this week.\nFees for 'one-off users have\nactually decreased, although the\nprice of season tickets has\nincreased. Mr Rick Bilby, ICU\nDeputy President, who is part of the\nSports Centre Users Group, said\nthat,'it was the best deal we could\nhave got, and I think it's very fair'.\nMr Bilby himself had a hand in\nreducing the price of the season\nticket to \u00a327.00, which was\noriginally set at \u00a348.00. Tha main\nchange remains the introduction of\nstreamed opening hours, in which\nit becomes more expensive to use\nthe Sports Centre at busier times of\nthe day. Full details can be found\non the Sports page of this week's Felix.\nThe Centre is set to open on the\n15th of February, after having been\ndelayed for one and a half months.\nWork on the new refurbishments\nwas originally due to start during\nthe third term of last year, ready for\nopening at the start of this academic\nyear, but didn't actually start until\nsome time over the summer.\n'Difficulties with the contractors'\nwas the official reason given for the\nsecond delay, although it is\nexpected that there may be some\ndispute with the contractors over\nexactly who should shoulder the\nblame for the delays.\nImprovements to the centre\ninclude an air-conditioned weights\ngym, wet and dry changing rooms,\nand a new health suite, comprising\nof a sauna/steam room, needle\nshower and Jacuzzi.\n7 8/9 11 16-20\nRag Rainbow Riley's Review\nRaves Revealed Round Trip Round-Up\n\n"

And there\nis a little bit more to it than just\nstepping up and down, as the book\nexplains. The exercises involve arm\nmovements, walking along the step,\nand even sitting on it!\nThe book begins with an\nintroduction to step exercising and\nthe standard exercise comments and\nExit Berlin\nby Tim Sebastian\nLast week was an appropriate one\nin which to review Tim Sebastian's new book, Exit Berlin. For one, the\ntrial of former East German\ndictator, Eric Honecker, ended in\n'frustration and farce', with the old\ndespot living to fight another day,\nor even three months, despite the\nfact that he is more likely to be\nsuffering from Chilean-wine induced tapeworm than liver\ncancer. The second event, surely\nmore important, was the publication\nof the transcript of that\nconversation between one C. Windsor (former heir to the throne)\nand the happily married C. ParkerBowles, who I am sure does not\nrecline like her namesake. The\nimportant element being, of course,\nthe theory that MI5, who do not\nexist per se, recorded the\nconversation in London and then\nre broad bast it in the sticks so many\ntimes that so ham was bound to pick\nit up. Well, they did attempt to\nde stabilise the Wilson government,\nremember?\nOf course, if you believe the\nconspiracy theory, then you are\nlikely to enjoy Sebastian's tome, it\nbeing this Guardian reader's fantasy-in-print. Unfortunately, the\nbook is sad, regretful even, to the\npoint of being melancholy. Such is\nthe nature of intelligence. There is\nalso a powerful, if subtle, craving\nfor revenge, a desire to settle old\nFelix 954\nadvice you find in any fitness book.\nThen it explains the step itself.\nApparently there is a recommended\nsize and height, and if you can't afford to buy one from a sports\nshop, you are encouraged to get out\nthat Black and Decker and make\none yourself.\nThe book then takes you through\na series of warm-up routines.\nInitially, explanations of each\nroutine are accompanied by very\nclear line drawings, normally two\nper exercise, but later on, in the\nmain routines, the diagrams\ndisappear and you're left with pages\nfull of text.\nAs you can probably tell by the\nstartling transformation to a sylph-like figure, I rigorously tested this\nexercise program.

It does tend\nto get a bit contorted, with the\nflashbacks causing a bit of 'where-are-we-now?' confusion. The text\nflows well, though the book's structure is fairly basic, slow to\nstart, building to a heady pace in the\nmiddle, then a bit of stock taking, followed by the helicopter dash to\nMoscow (where else?). I found it\nuseful to re-read the prologue after\nfinishing the book. It summarised\nthe plot, but only after reading the\nbook, as it gives nothing away on\nfirst reading.\nIt's very much in the Spycatcher\nmode, though eminently more\nreadable. I wonder how much is\ntrue, and how much is based on\nwhat Sebastian learned while he\nwas earning large peanuts as BBC\ncorrespondent in Poland, Moscow\nand Washington? The whole thing\nmay be complete, believable\nfantasy, but then again, the string\nof spy books from Sebastian could\nbe an airing all the skeletons he\nlearned of, strictly off the record,\ncomrade.\nMenace in my own shadow?\nDon't be ridiculous.\nBodhran\n\u2022 Published by Bantam Books,\nprice \u00a33.99.\nThe Salamandra Glass\nby AW Mykel\nAfter the violent death of Christian\nGladieoux his son Michael a former\nVietnam vet. goes in search of\nvengeance.

For those\nof you with short memories or who\nwere not here last year, a room in\nPrince's Gardens is rented on a34 or 39 week agreement. The shorter\none means, you have to move out\nduring the Easter vacation, but, also\nthat you pay less rent. Most first\nyears sign the 34 week contract to\nsave money. This is before they\nrealise they have exams straight\nafter Easter and have to watch their\npossessions do a yoyo impression\nin and out of their room, days\nbefore important tests.\nEaster is special because the\npotential revenue from renting out\nrooms for conference\naccommodation is phenomenal.\nDespite the fact that a week in\ncentral London would not be my\nfavoured conference residence and\nthat Southside Halls are such a state,\nfew people would want to spend\nmore than a student rent to live in\nthem, still, the amount of money\nraised by other Universities acts as\nan irresistible bait to our\nac comma dati on section.\nBecause the pressure to raise\nmoney is so high, if you decided it\nwould be best to stay in London in\nyour own room before exams start,\nit is very unlikely you will be\nallowed .to do so. After all, you\nhave signed a contract which stated\nyou could only spend 34 weeks in\nhall, so to change it would be\nbreaking a legal agreement.\nApparendy, each first year should\nhave had these conditions explained\nto them before they arrived at\nImperial. Did you? I sincerely\ndoubt it and judging by the fact that\nworries have begun to surface this\nearly in the spring term, I am not\nalone. When will Residences start\nto consider the students who live\nmost of the year in Halls, instead\nof fly-by-night conference guests?\nCould it be something to do with the\nfact that it is in such debt that, the\ncheapest and most aesthetic solution\nwould be to pull down all the\nPrince's Gardens Halls?\nSex\nAccording to a survey for Carlton's good sex guide 56% of men have\norgasms each time they make love.\nPonder that one while you are in\nyour Friday morning lecture.

The Irish question, to most\nof us is - quite literally - a deadly\naffair, yet with a little gloss it can\nbe transformed into compulsive\nviewing.

That band\nwith the funny hair from the 70's?' 'Erm, no... the children's program. '\nI'm even more bemused now.\nApparently unbeknown to me those\nnasty people at Carlton, who won\nThames Television's franchise,\nintend to let Zippy and George drift\noff to puppet valhalla and Bungle\nend up on somebody's hearth. But,\nstudents at Heathrop College,\nLondon have leapt to Rainbow's defence and have launched 'The\nSave Rainbow Campaign' in order\nto attract someone to buy the\nlongest running children's program\nin history, and restore it to\nmainstream TV. At present, if a buyer is not found, the nation's under fives will have to ask mummy\nand daddy for a satellite dish so they\ncan watch 20 year old repeats on\nUK Gold at six in the morning.\nI put it upon myself to find out\nwhat the hell all the fuss was about.\nBasically, when Carlton secured the\nITV franchise from Thames they\nwere free to pick and choose which\nprograms they wanted to buy and\nthose which they deemed\nunsuitable, ie. that weren't good\nmoney spinners, to be left out in the\ncold.\nIn trying to get an official\ncomment, I got as far as a rather\nbitter sounding lady at Thames who\ntold me that 'everybody here's been\nmade redundant because of\nCarlton'. Carlton seemed to think\nThames were responsible and the\nbuck was passed on again. The plot\nthickens perhaps? Has Rainbow met\nits end as a result of the discovery\nof disturbing and intimate details\nregarding the private lives of the\nshows stars? Has Zippy been\nzipping up George 'Frank Bough'\nstyle?\nIn your wildest dreams, readers,\nor perhaps not, I suppose.\nI spoke to Paul Shuttleworth who\nalerted the masses to the plight of\nthe longest running children's program in history with his piece in\nThe Daily Sport.\nQ: Paul, how did it all start?\nA: Well it was back in November at\nHeathrop when somebody decided\nto pass a motion to change the\nnames of common rooms 1, 2 and\n3 to the Bungle, Zippy and George\ncommon rooms. This was once\nwe'd gotten wind of Rainbow's dilemma, but before it had actually\nended.\nQ: Why is Rainbow in this situation?\nA: When Thames lost its franchise\nto Carlton it was no longer able to\nshow Rainbow. Although they do\nstill want to show it they can't until\nsomebody else buys it.\nQ: And Carlton didn't?A: Yeah, except come the Autumn\nthen what can happen is they can go\nstraight to the ITV network\ncontroller and he can buy the\nprogramme so the campaign is now\ntrying to make sure he does.\nQ: Is it possible that they might\ndecide to replace Rainbow with a more up to date format just as the\nBBC did by replacing Play School\nwith Play Bus?\nA: Well, Rainbow has been around\nfor almost twenty years now but it's still a classic.\nQ: Was there a big party at the end\nof the last series?\nA: No there was no party. I mean\nthat's it. Thames kept it very quiet,\nin fact the only reason it got into the\npress was that 'The Save Rainbow\nCampaign' took it upon themselves\nto tell them. Thames didn't want to\nmention it at all.\nQ: Is Jacquie Doyle-Price, the\nleader of 'The Save Rainbow\nCampaign', a mother herself?\nA: No, she's a twenty two year old\nstudent. Most of the people\ninvolved in the campaign are in our\ngeneration.\nQ: So it's more to do with saving a classic programme, than for the\nsake of the children, the majority of\nwhose parents cannot afford to send\nthem to nursery school. Who would\nbe deprived of it?\nA: Yeah, it's classic...also the way\nRainbow ended just pointed to the\nfact that people don't care about\nchildren's programmes in this\ncountry. You know all the heavy\npapers have loads of stuff about\ncurrent affairs and news and stuff\nbut nobody cares about children's telly. There's a danger of any\nquality that's left in children's television diminishing as ITV\nbecomes more commercialised.\nQ: Will the Rainbow team be\nmaking any extra public\nappearances to help promote the\ncause?\nA: Well they have been gutted and\nthey need time to compose\nthemselves, but they've been\ngetting rip roaring receptions at the\nBristol Hippodrome where they're\nstaring in Jack and the Beanstalk\nand Geoffrey can't leave the theatre\nwithout being mobbed by hundreds\nof fans.\nQ: As you see it now, what do you\nthink the programme's chances are?\nPage 8\n\n"

Last\nweek I gave you the lowdown on\na few of the bigger events coming\nup in Rag Week, and now, with\nonly one six more days til the\nofficial start of the craziest week of\nthe year, I think it's time to fill you\nin on a few of the details. So take\na deep breath, give your lecturer a smile, and join me for a whistles top guide to Rag Week.\nFriday 29th, Rag Carnival,\norganised by Guilds. Barfly\njumping and booze - the perfect way\nto kick off the week. Also the\nlaunch of the Limited Edition Rag\nWeek T shirt. If you don't turn up\nto Carnival you won't be able to\nbuy one, as simple as that! Read the\narticle elsewhere on this page for\ndetails.\nSaturday 30th, Rag Raid. A mass\norgy/collection which will probably\ntake place in Birmingham. Spend a day holding a can whilst the public\npour money into it, and relax\nafterwards with a huge party, with\nLoughbrough Rag, at Birmingham\nUnion.\nSunday 31st, Rag Rugby & five-legged pub crawl. Mines firsts play\nthe Ladies' rugby team - but with\na twist. The men are handicapped\nby suspenders and well ies! Cap it all with a five-legged pub crawl in the\nevening and you have a bona fide excuse for not walking in a particularly straight line, or even\nstaggering!\nMonday 1st, Mines Dirty Disco.\nYou should know all about this\nfrom last week's article, but if you\nwere too busy scribbling down\nlecture notes to concentrate fully,\nthe principle is this: the less you\nwear, the less you pay. Simple,\nhuh?\nTuesday 2nd, Slave Auction &\nFilm Evening. The Slave Auction\nis where anyone who is silly enough\nto take part auctions off twenty four hours of their time, with the\nproceeds going to charity. This\nevent is a chance for anybody who\nhasn't quite got round to tidying\ntheir room for a while, or done the\nwashing up in the past six weeks,\nor managed to find the time to\nscrape that particularly nasty\ngrowth off the mouldy bit of carpet\nin the corner, to buy a slave to do\nit for them. Imagine! All your meals\ncooked, clothes washed, lab reports\nwritten up... .unfortunately, sexual\nfavours by consent only! But still\nworth considering - you could even\nclub together with a group of\nfriends to buy a really good-looking\nslave! Mech Eng 220 at lunchtime.\nBe there or miss the bargains. The\nfilm evening is kindly organised for\nRag by FilmSoc, and will include\nsuch delights as pre-film cartoons\nand Monty Python. Hopefully with\na bar as well. Venue, time and films\nto be announced - watch this space!\nWednesday 3rd, Beer Festival. If\nyou don't know about this yet then\nyou don't know the right people.\nThis annual event is the biggest non-CAM RA beer festival in the\ncountry, and basically involves lots\nof people spending the whole\nafternoon drinking lots of different\nbeers in the comfort and safety of\nthe JCR. Also your first chance to\npurchase this year's version of IC's notorious RagMag. Full list of beers\nshould be appearing in next week's Rag Week pull-out in Felix.\nThursday 4th, Hypnosis. Martin\nTaylor, hypnotist extra ordinaire, spends the evening putting people\ninto trances. Not quite in the same\nway as a lecturer does, though!\nRather more entertaining and no\nscrawled lecture notes to revise\nafterwards.\nFriday 5th, Rag Bash.\nApproaching the end of Rag Week,\nwe take over the Union once again\nfor live bands, disco and a bit of a party.\nSaturday 6th, SNK PJ, or\nSponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump, to give it its full\ntitle. This is where you watch crazy\npeople streaking from Harrods back\nto College, trying not to get arrested\non the way. Last year, Steve\nFarrant and Paul Thomas got\n'picked up' (in a manner of\nspeaking) by the Diplomatic Police,\nwho gave them a lift back to the\nUnion. Serves them right for\nstrolling back wearing nothing but\nbow ties! A prize is on offer for the\nlast person back, so who dares\nwins.\nOK, that's all the events covered.\nBut Rag Week is a lot more than\njust these! For a start there are the\nservices, most of which were listed\nlast week. The Guilds Hit Squad,\nthose Masters of the Flan, will be\non the loose again, settling old\nscores and starting feuds. The RCS\nwill be doing Handcuff-a grams,\nPint-a grams and Milkie-milk iea grams plus g no ming and grim-reaping. The contracts will be \u00a35\neach, but there are discounts for\nbulk orders and an eg io ti able rate\nfor 'notables'. So if you share a grudge against someone with a group of friends, then club together\nand get your own back. Let them\nguess who took the contract out!\nAnother service Rag will be\nproviding throughout the week is\nbreakfast for those people who\nalways wake up too late in the\nmorning to make their own! You\nshould be welcomed outside your\nlecture theatre by cheap cereal and\na not-too-cheery smile (Raggies\ndon't like getting up early either!)\nso there is no excuse for rumbling\ntummies all the way through your\nlectures.\nLast but not least, just for you,\nRag have also organised for Queens\nTower to be open two lunchtimes\nin Rag Week. Between the hours of\n12-2pm on Monday 1st Feb and\nThursday 4th Feb, you will (for\nonly a nominal fee) be able to\npartake of the breathtaking views of\nLondon to be had fr on the top of\nQT. Remember your camera! The\nWANNA SLAUGHTER YOUR\nFRIENDS? ELIMINATE ABSOLUTE STRANGERS? TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE IN SOUTHSIDE?\nYEAH?\nThen play KILLER! The Rag\ngame of murder, mayhem and\nserious fun. Arm yourself and hunt\ndown your target, \"remove\" them\nand then on to their target, see that\nbody count rise.\nTo play, all you need are two\nclear passport photos of yourself\ntower is not open on many\noccasions throughout the year, so\nmake the most of it.\nFinally, if you haven't got\ninvolved yet, either by offering\nyour services as a gnome or reaper,\nor taking part in Killer, or giving\nup a day in the Slave Auction\n(which may not be as bad as it\nsounds - my '24hrs' last year turned\nout to be no more taxing than being\ntaken out for a Chinese meal by two\nvery charming Greek students!),\nthen you have only one week left\nto reconsider. Take the chance to\ndo something really silly for a very\ngood cause before the exams get\neven closer and you might - horror\nof horrors!- actually have to start\nworking! Be Mad, Be Silly but\nwhatever else you do, make sure\nyou're a part of it.\nand \u00a32.50. Get yourself along to the\nIC Union office at any lunchtime\nbefore January 27th or come along\nto today's Rag meeting, usual\nplace, usual time. Whichever you\ngo to, you'll get a copy of the rules,\nyour first target and a death\ncertificate. Alternatively, contact\nAndy Wensley through the 3rd year\nU Gmail racks in the Maths\ndepartment. With cash prizes for\nthe winners, you don't want to miss\nout on this. Remember, have fun\nand be lethal!\nMURDER!\nPage 7\n\n"
