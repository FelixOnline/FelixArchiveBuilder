JAY MEWS\nYes, last term squat\nis still there\u2014and now\nhas homeless families\nwith kids in it too. Students, after all, are fighting \"for a 'living grant\nand a decent place to\nlive in\" AND decent\nhousing for everyone\nelse too.\nAn eviction order has\nbeen granted to the owners (the Commissioners\nfor the Exhibition of\n1851, the college's land-lords). They haven't tried to use it properly\nyet except on New Year's eve, when they broke-in\n(despite a promise made\nin Court not to do anything before the New\nYear)\u2014and left after being caught by three students (see Joy Mews\nNews No. 3).\nThe owners have so\nfar failed to give clear\nanswers to three ques-t ions.1. Will they undertake\nnot to attempt an\neviction before the\nCourt Appeal which\nis being 'lodged\nagainst them?\n2. Will they allow the\npremises to be used\nat least until they\nneed 'it?\n3. What do they intend\nto do with the empty\nhouses anyway?\nCome round to Joy\nMews, support the squat.\nBe ready to rush there\nand help defend it as\nsoon as you hear.\nIf students show their\nsupport enough then\nmaybe the Cortege and\nWestminster Council can\nbe forced\u2014along with\nthe owners\u2014to enable\nmore long term usage of\nthe empty properties for\nstudents and families.\nTelegram from Leeds\nPoly \u2014 \"STOP EVICTIONS.

    "content": "Tuesday, January 8th,1974 FELIX Page S PURPLE PATCH j P.A.W. X.O.^^^^^ Once again we get to\nthe beginning of another\nterm, and it is part of my\njob to write another\nPurple Patch for Felix. I cannot deny that after\nthe vacation it is very\ndifficult to think of interesting news to tell you,\nhowever, there are a couple of items which I think that you will be\nhappy to hear about.\nThe first bit of news\nis that after the increase\nin Refectory prices,\nwhich was initiated at\nthe beginning of last\nterm, the latest information is that the refectories are making a profit\n. . . just! This profit is\nrealised on a turnover of\nsome \u00a3112,000. So, as\nfar as I, and also the college financial secretary,\ncan see, there is going\nto be no need for a rise\nin refectory prices in the\nnear future.\nThe next piece of\nnews which I should inform you about is that\nthere is a likelihood of\nthe college buying a house in Queensbury\nPlace for use as a student residence. This\nhouse, it is thought,\nwill be able to cater for\nsome 30 students, and\nwill provide similar accommodation to the student houses. It is hoped\nthat the accommodation\nwill be available for occupation at the beginning of next session.\nNegotiations are at\nthe moment taking place\nfor the purchase of the\nproperty, the majority of\nthe money coming from\nthe Voluntary levy which\nthe students in our Halls\nand houses have been\npaying for the past three\nyears. This levy has now\nreached the grand total\nof \u00a356,000, indicating\nthe initial money collected has been very well in-vested. What we hope\nto do with this house is\nto try to make it as near\nas possible the ideal\ntype of student residence, and a committee\nwill be set up with student representation to\ndeal with the design of\nthe property before the\nstudents actually move\nin. It is hoped that we\nwill be able to keep the\ncost of accommodation\non a par with that in the\nhails of residence and in\nStudent houses, and the\ndiscipline in the house\nwill be kept by a student\nwarden, who will hopefully be elected either at\nthe end of this term or\nat the beginning of next\nterm. So those of you\nwho are interested,\nplease begin thinking\nabout the job.\nMost of you who were\nhere last year during the\nelection campaigns for\nPresident and Hon. Secretary, may have wondered what has happened to the ideas put forward about the take-over\nof the Union Bar and\nUnion refectory. Well,\nsur sp rise, surprise, these\nideas have come back to\nlife, and you will hopefully be hearing more\nabout them as the term\ngoes on. As you may\nwell realise, there is\ngoing to have to be a great deal of thought and\neffort put into this operation as we will need a very convincing case in\norder to persuade the\nboard of Governors that\nwe are capable of taking\nover the areas and not\nmaking a great loss.\nThe reason for the\ntakeover as many of you\nmay imagine is an effort\nto show that we are\ncapable of managing our\naffairs, and this includes\nthe catering side of the\nUnion building. What I envisage as the basic\nideals of the takeover are\nthat there will be a Union Manager who will\ndeal with the overall\nmanagement of the\nUnion and he will be responsible to a Union\ncommittee. As far as I am concerned the takeover will not tin 'itself\nmean that the existing\nstaff will be required to\nleave. Of course, if they\ndecide to leave and work\nfor Mr. Mooney, then\nthey shall be well within\ntheir rights to do so, but\nof course, I would rather\nthey did not.\nAs I said earlier, you\nwill be hearing more\nabout this later on in the\nterm, but in the mean-time, if anyone is particularly interested in the\nproject then I would be\nvery grateful if they\nwould come to see me,\nand maybe even offer a little of their time to\nhelp me with the necessary survey of other colleges who have undertaken this type of take-over.\nLast but by no means\nleast are the elections\nwhich are coming up this\nterm. We should, by all\nrights, be electing a President, Hon. Secretary\nand also a Deputy President and another post to\nbe decided upon by the\nUnion. These elections\nare vital to the future of\nthe Union, and I hope\nthat you will take them\nseriously. As many of\nyou will remember, for\nthe past two years it has\nbeen remarkably difficult\nto elect any Union officers, and worst of all the\nsabbatical posts. I would\nimplore any one of you\nwho has any aspirations\nwhat s over towards doing\nany of the Union jobs\nor the incredible Hon.\nSec./Editor of Felix/\nJack of all trades.\nWelcome back, and I hope that you had a nice\nXmas and may I wish\nyou all a Happy New\nYear.\nAs you may have already noticed, the previous editor Alisthair\nCampbell resigned at\nthe end of the last term.\nOn page 2 you will find\nin full what Council decided would happen. In\nthe meantime anyone interested in the job of coordinating the production of Felix should contact me in the Union Office. It is hoped that the\njob will be made considerably easier with the\neditorial board.\nAs for this issue, I must firstly apologise\nfor its condition. It was\nliterally thrown together\nlast Thursday and was\nmy first attempt after\nhaving been literally\n\"thrown in at the deep\nend\" so to speak. I have\nalso, due to the Xmas\nvacations, had to write\n(or copy, as the case\nmay be) most of the articles myself. Don't complain about the\nstandard of reporting, if\nyou can do better, come\nalong and do so. Secondly, my thanks go to\nDave Sinclair, who filled\nfor next year to stand\nfor election. After all, the\nworst thing that can happen to you is that you\ncan be elected. If anyone\nwould like to find out\nmore about the various\nposts which are being\nmade vacant at the end\nof this year, then all you\nhave to do is to come\nalong and ask the person\nwho is doing the job\nnow, and at least we will\nin on the setting of the\npaper, as I had to go for\nan interview at the time.\nLastly, whilst I am in\ncharge of Felix, I am\nhoping to introduce\nsome new, college orientated articles. Firstly, if\nthey are submitted, I hope to have a regular\npage of articles from\nvarious Union clubs and\nsocieties. This would\nbe somewhat like the\nsections in the Societies\nHandbook with the obvious advantage that\nthere would be space for\na much longer article. If\nyou think you'd like to\nwrite an article about\nyour club captain or soc-ie ty, please contact your\nclub captain or president.\nAnother new idea\n(though not an original\none) is a regular problems column, \"Aunty\nLucy\". Details of this\nare again on Page Two.\nI would like to make\nan appeal to Scaramanga\nof Broadsheet fame, to\nsubmit an article to me\nfor each edition. Anything will be accepted,\nso long as it can't be\nconstrued as being libel-lou s. For ideas, please\nrefer to \"Colcutt\" in Felices of a few years ago,\navailable in the Union\nOffice.\nRemember! This is\nyour paper, paid for out\nof your Union funds. It\nwill only be value for\nbe able to tell you what\nhe should be doing!\nThe third sabbatical is\nat the moment not fixed.\nWe have the money for\nthe post, but as we now\nhave no Felix Editor,\nthen that sabbatical is\nnot being used. If anyone has any suggestions\nas to the best use of this\nsabbatical salary then\nwe would be glad to\nhear it. The idea at the\nmoney if it contains\nwhat you want to read.\nAlso, the best way to ensure that it contains\nwhat you want to read is\nto submit articles. Therefore, get writing and\nmake this a paper worth\nreading again. You may\nthink that it .never was\nworth reading. In the\nUnion Office there are\ncopies ranging back over\nseveral years that will\nshow you that it was.\nELECTIONS\nYet again these amazing spectaculars are\nnearly upon us. In the\ncalendar in this issue\nyou will find the dates\non which the nomination\npapers will be put up,\nand also the dates they\nwill be removed followed by the elections and\nthe results. If you wish\nto stand for any of these\nposts please watch out\nfor the nomination\npapers.\nCOMPLACENCY\nLast term the Union\nsuffered from the above\n(better known as\napathy). Thought:\u2014 Do\nyou really want a Union\nto act on your behalf,\nput your views forward,\nsupply your money? Or\nis everyone who believes\nin the Union, who work\nhard, mostly with little\nor no encouragement,\nwasting their time?\nmoment is to elect a sabbatical Publications Officer, whose job would\nbe to deal With the\nwhole realm of publications of the Union, including Felix, Phoenix,\nand also Stoic.\nI hope your term goes\nwell, and that you wi H come forward with more\nideas that will be possible to put into action.\nNORM.\nSO YOU THINK YOU SPEAK PROPER?\nWith even eminent playwrights such\nas E. Wise using phrases like, \"With\ntalent like What I 've got,\" one begins\nto wonder how many people actually\nspeak 'Queen's English' these days.\nWe ali i know that English is a bastard language and, even though it\nis the most widely used, 'is one of\nthe hardest to learn. The main reason for this is its numerous strange\nquirks, eg. bow and bough although\npronounced the same have different\nspellings and meanings. The Americans have not helped matters much\nby changing the spelling of many of\nour words, eg. color, sulfur, and\nthis type of inconsistency makes the\ntask of others learning our tongue\nmore difficult.\nApart from this, however, how\nwell do you think you have done\nin (learning your mother tongue. You\nhave all obtained ' 0 ' level English\nbut exactly how literate are you. This\nlis a short test to help you test your\nknowledge and remember, you are\nthe most 'intelligent members of\nsociety \u2014 think how lesser mortals\nmight get on.\n1.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Tuesday, January 8th,1974 RECTORS PLAN FOR COLLEGE DEVELOPMENT\nSince he arrived Sir Brian Flowers has been giving some thought to the\ndirection in which he would like to see the college develop along. Printed here is\nthe major part of a speech that he gave at an Old Centralians Luncheon on\nThursday, 13th December, 1973.\nFollowing on from this Sir Brian brought the subject up again at the Board\nof Governors meeting, giving them a potted version of the same speech. He also\nmentioned, in particular, the Mass. Institute of Technology and the way in which\nthey aim for the total technological activity of the subjects they work in. The\ngovernors appeared to be wholly in favour of the Rector's suggestions and gave\nhim leave to continue with investigations into its feasibility.\nStudents' direct\naction over grants\ngoes on-Randall\nThe central problem of\nmy past life has been how\nto determine scientific\npriorities. Many people\nprobably think that I concerned myself with the\ngiving of grants to individual university professors to enable them to\ncarry out their research.\nIndeed, I was very much\nconcerned with the system for doing that, but I hardly ever had to concern myself with a particular case. In particular\ncases the central issue is\nah vay s \"Is that a good\nand promising piece of\nchemistry?\" or \"Is that a worthwhile piece of mechanical engineering?\" Only\nthe chemists and mechanical engineers, as the case\nmay be, can answer those\nquestions, and the peer-group system of the research councils is deficient\nat this only insofar as it\ncomprises fallible human\nbeings.\nThe much more difficult questions are \"How\nmuch should we spend\naltogether on chemistry?\"\nor \"What avenues would\nwe particularly like to encourage mechanical engineers to explore?\" These\nare difficult because they\npose problems which fall\noutside the competence of\nthe peer-group. How\nmuch we spend on chemistry is not only a matter\nfor the chemists: firstly\nbecause with finite resources what they spend\nis not then available for\nmechanical engineers to\nspend; but much more importantly because in the\nend all the sciences, pure\nand applied, arc interconnected and interdependent.\nChemists, to continue with\nthe example, are great\nusers of instrumentation,\nvery little of which they\ndevise themselves. The\nprogress of chemistry,\neven the direction it takes,\nthus depends almost as\nmuch upon the products\ni>f other disciplines as\nupon the activities of\nchemists.\nYou notice I 've made\nno mention of physicists:\nthey are quite different!\nSo in trying to determine the priorities of individual academic disciplines we see emerging interdisciplinary questions\nto be answered. There is\nin fact a hierarchy of\nsuch questions. For in the\nend government has to\nprovide for most of the\nresearch that is done (as\ndistinct from develop-ment, although it funds\na lot of that as well).\nGovernments are not interested (or should not be\nif the system is working\nproperly) in how much\nwe spend on chemistry or\non any other academic\ndiscipline. Their problems\nare quite different. They\nshould not even have to\nworry much about re-search, as such. They are\nconcerned with the great\nsocial objectives: how\nmuch do we want, and\nare prepared to spend on\nimproved industrial pro-duct iv it y, more relevant\neducation, better health,\nurban renewal, alternative energy sources, de-fence; and so on. Each of\nthese demands research;\nbut the priorities to be\nset at Government level\nare social priorities, not\nacademic ones; in one\nway or another, all academic activity is undertaken in support of social\nobjectives.\nThe problem I was concerned with in my previous existence was that of\ntrying to match a little\nbetter the intrinsic needs\nand capabilities of the\nvarious academic disciplines to the extrinsic\nneeds of social, political\nand economic reality.\nThis, for me, was what\nscience policy was all\nabout, and very interesting it was too. One had\nto learn to see scientific\npriorities as a two-dimensional affair: the various\nscientific activities in one\ndimension and the ultimate needs for it in an-other. A structure was required in both dimensions, and somehow one\nhad to try to match the\ntwo structures.\nWell, what is the relevance of this lengthy diatribe to Imperial College?\nWe are, of course, one of\nthe leading institutions\nfor training scientists and\nengineers, and for research in these subjects.\nAs far as that aspect is\nconcerned, where we are\nnot so good we must simply strive to become so.\nBut I believe we are peculiarly fitted \u2014 and in\nthis we may well be unique in this country \u2014 to\ntrain students for, and to\ntake part in the totality\nof technological activity.\nThis means that we must\nfirst recognise it for what\nit is: something \"essential-ly multi-disciplinary. And\nthis means, that although\nour teaching must always\nbe founded upon the well-established academic disciplines (for otherwise it\nlacks intellectual integrity), that teaching must\nbe enriched by a much\nwider experience drawn\nfrom the real life of industry and government\nand the professions, and\nfrom other disciplines.\nAnd that in turn means\nthat there is no room at\nImperial College for rigid\nacademic boundaries, or\nfor heads of departments\nwho believe they are self-sufficient: the barons, we\ncall them.\nI have been greatly encouraged by discussing in\nour Board of Studies the\nresults of a survey, undertaken by Sir David\nHuddie, of what our graduates from 1929 to 1963\nthought of the education\nwe gave them, and where\nit has got them. Those\nwho had done best of all\nturned out to be a very\nselect band indeed who,\nhaving achieved no better\nthan a pass degree, then\nwent on to become doctors of science. Tt just\nshows, there's hope for\nus all if we've got a bit\nof blarney! What interested me most, however,\nwas the response to questions about content of the\ncourse: what topics had\nthey found most useful,\nwhich least useful, and especially Which subjects\nwould they now have\nwished had been in clu ded? If this survey is anything to go by the College\nhas adapted very well to\nchanging need because almost all preferences have\nalready been put into\neffect: especially, we have\nincluded a goodly sprinkling of multi-disciplinary\nactivities. Of course, what\nwe would really like to\nknow is what the students\nof today will say about\nus 20 years from now\nwhen they are at the\nheight of their powers.\nHave we only adapted to\nthe needs of yesterday, or\nare we now really catering\nfor tomorrow, our proper\njob?\nI want to see whether\nwe cannot set up some\nkind of two-dimensional\nstructure at Imperial College, so that we can hope\n\u2014as a university, not as\nan industry which we arc'\nnot\u2014to face up better to\nthe totality of real technological activity. I detest talking in the ab-s tract, so let me give you\njust one example of what\n1 mean. You must regard\nit for the moment as completely hypothetical, and\nit certainly does not represent anyone's decision,\nleast of all those most\nconcerned.\nSupposing we wanted\nto match our educational\nand research activities to\nthe total technological\nneeds of the aviation bus i ness. What would we have\nto do? Well, we have an\nAeronautics Department,\nand very good it is too.\nThey are very expert in\naerodynamics, as you'd expect, and in air-frame\nstructures, and they do\na bit of avionics. Unfortunately, that doesn't get\nthe aircraft off the ground\nbecause they do not work\non engines. Quite right,\ntoo, because that should\nbe done in Mechanical\nEngineering where they\nknow about such things,\ntogether with Chemical\nEngineering where they\nknow about fuels. Having\ngot it off the ground, how-ever, you need a lot of\ncontrol engineering to fly\nit safely, and communications engineering to get to\nthe right place at the right\ntime. You need a lot of\nmaintenance engineering\n(tera-technology they call\nit nowadays) to keep it in\nservice, and you need\nmanagement expertise to\nstop the airline from going bust, not to mention\nthe manufacturer. Increasingly you need to see\naviation as but one economic (as well as techno-logical) component of. an\nintegrated transportation\nsystem. And you need to\nattend to the special aviation needs for all the\nunderlying sciences, such\nas operational research\nand the development of\nspecial materials. If we\nwere really to take our\ntask in aviation seriously\nin the College we would\nhave to pay attention to\nall of that at least.\nNow it would simply\nbe silly to try to do all\nthat in one academic de-partment. It isn't one\nacademic discipline, to\nstart with, but a continuous stratum of contiguous\ndisciplines and nobody\ncould be expected to\nknow it all. It would also\nbe uncontrollable. But we\ncould have strong horizontal links labelled a via tion, running across and\nconnecting the vertical\nstructures labelled aeronautical engineering, materials technology, and\nmanagement science. And\nthrough the horizontal\nlinks we could try to feed\nin the views Of the users\nof aeroplanes, not just the\nmanufacturers: the airlines and \u2014 God help\nthem!\u2014the passengers.\nOf course, we should\nhave to consider other\nhorizontal links for other\nmajor sectors of technological activity: high-speed ground transport,\nfor instance (which might\nstill benefit from this\napproach), or mineral resource production and\nconservation.\nWell, I told you that T; was all going to be hypo-the t ical. It is probably\nquite impracticable, and\nI dare say the barons of\nImperial College will convince me that it simply\ncannot be done: it\nwouldn't fit into their departmental structures. But\nit's what needs doing: and\nit would be fun trying to\ndo it.\nStudents will not drop\ntheir campaign for bigger and better grants,\nMr. John Randall, president of the National\nUnion of Students, said\non Wednesday.\nEven though it had\nbeen suggested that students should tighten\ntheir belts along with the\nrest of the country, rent\nstrikes, demonstrations\nand other forms of direct\naction by students would\ncontinue, he told the\nunion's technical colleges conference in\nNewcastle.\nTo those who made\nan appeal to students in\nsupport of a misguided\nconcept of the \"national\ninterest\", Mr. Randall\nsaid: \"Our campaign is\ndesigned to pave the\nway to an acceptance in\nreal terms of education\nas a right for all.

This was in reply\nte their accusations levelled at the college administration in general and\nthe personnel officer in\nparticular. The letter is\nprinted in full as the\nRector hopes that it will\nbe as widely publicised as\npossible. It appears that\nthe ASTM's attempt to\n\"try out\" the new Rector\nover a strong political\npoint is not going to go\nthe way their leaders\nwould like. Printed here\nare the two letters and I 'll\nlet you judge for yourself.\nTo all members of the\n(governing Body:\nIt is axiomatic that the\nCollege administration\nwill stand between the\n(governing Body and the\nstaff of the College. We\n<Jq not know how the Ad ministration report on\nmon-academic staff matters or on College based\ntrade unions. We only\nknow what the College\nAdministration carry out\nin the name of the Governing Body. We know\nthat secretly, to give\nfavours to non-trade uni-on is ts, the College Administration is breaking a national agreement. We\nknow that there was\nextensive questioning of\napplicants for a post of\nDepartmental Superintendent regarding membership of ASTMS, centred\nround the insulting attitude of loyalty to ASTM S vis-a vis loyalty to the\nCollege.\nYou will therefore not\nbe surprised if we take\nthe opportunity to report\ndirect to you and else-where, in such a way as is\nconstructive. The enclosed\ncopy of an open letter is\nsuch a report.\nYours sincerely,\nMr. H. Fairbrother,\nSecretary.\nAn Open Letter\u2014\nShould the Personnel Secretary Resign?\nThere is an organisation existing to which\nmost Personnel Officers\nbelong. This organisation\naims to foster high standards of integrity in that\nprofession. It proclaims\nthat the function of a Personnel Officer is to honestly attempt to solve\nindustrial relations problems, even if this involves\ndisagreeing with their\nemployer.\nDoes Mr. Malone mea-syr e up to these admirable\nstandards?\nIt is the view of the\nBranch Committee that\nhe does not.\nThe College brought\nhim in to improve staff-College relations, at least\nthat what was the former\nRector said at the time.\nThe reverse has happened.\nNever has there been such\na bad and disgraceful situation as now exists.\nThe National Agreement requires the post of\nDepartmental Superintendent to be part of the\nTechnical Staff structure,\nif the work done is the\nsame as the Job Description in the Blue Book,\nEverybody knows that that\nis the case in this College,\nnevertheless the College\nwill not comply with this\nAgreement.\nWe have a local agreement that a special criteria should be used to\ndecide whether Experimental Officers should be\nregarded as Academic or\nTechnical Staff. We are\nsure that this is being bro-ken, and that some \"blue\neyed boys\" are being\nSlipped through as para-Academics, when they do\nnot meet the criteria.\nEvery request by us to\nbe able to check what has\nhappened has been eva d ed.\nThere is a National\nAgreement covering the\nway in which Non Union\npeople can appeal against\ntheir grading s. This agreement involves our participation in the Appeals\nCommittee. We have now\ndiscovered that this is also\nbeing secretly broken.\nNon-Union Experimental\nOfficers who had been\nplaced in the Technical\nStaff, but believe that they\nshould be 'Academics',\nare appearing before\nSpecial Appeal Committees, without either our\nknowledge or agreement.\nOur protests have been\nignored.\nMonths ago we discussed with the College a request by us for direct\nASTM S representation on\nboth the Safety and Training Committee. We were\npromised an early reply.\nNot only has there been\nno reply, but we know\nthat IC has since made a statement to the University Safety Officers Committee that there should\nbe no Union representation on any Safety Committee.\nIn April last we made\nproposals to re grade a member of the Maintenance staff who holds a responsible position. It is\nour view that he should\nbe graded as a Maintenance Officer and properly\npaid. In fact he is underpaid and graded as a Clerk. In the last month\nwe have made three requests for a meeting to\nclear the matter up, but\nhave failed to get a meet-ing.\nSimilarly with the College Telephone Engineers.\nHitherto they have been\nlinked with the Technicians for grading and pay.\nWith restructuring what\nwill happen to them?'\nRepeated requests for a meeting bring promises\nbut no meeting.\nAll the above are but a selection of the problems\nthat we have been unable\nto solve. The most serious\nquestion, however, is the\ntotally unacceptable situation on Restructuring of\nthe Technical Staff.\nThere were 149 appeals\nby Union members, 54\nhave been heard, leaving\n95 yet to be done. Every\nother London College has\nfinished the entire pro ce dure, local, Regional and\nNational level appeals.\nThe absence of any effort\nby the College to complete the exercise is due to\nan attitude of contempt\nby them for the Technical\nStaff.\n. Moreover, despite the\nfact that in some depart-ment s, notably Mechanical Engineering Department, the exercise was\ncarried out in the most\ninefficient and biased\nmanner, no attempt has\nbeen made to rectify the\nbad initial grading s. This\nhas resulted in members\nbeing forced into the\nAppeals machinery quite\nunnecessarily, and with\nno guarantees of obtaining justice.\nThere has been extraordinary happenings affecting individuals, even\nincluding attempts at\nintimidation. The case of\nour Branch Chairman,\nArthur Sier, being one of\nthe worst. The Personnel\nSecretary told him quite\nbluntly that if he put his\nown case to appeal, then\nhe would be made to regret it!\nNeedless to say those\nremarks were made to the\nwrong address!!\nSo, where do we Go?\nCan we go on like this?\nAbout a year ago, all of\nthe Unions in the College\nmet the College Secretary\nto request changes in the\nattitude of the Personnel\nDepartment. Promises\nwere made but things are\nnow worse than ever.\nIt is now becoming\nclear that normal negotiating channels are being\nclosed to us. This we will\nnot tolerate.\nThere are other ways\nto get things done and we\nmust be prepared to use\nthem.\nOn behalf of the\nBranch Committee,\nH. Fairbrother,\nSecretary.\nCONSTITUTIONAL\nREFORM\nAt the last meeting of\nCouncil a working party\nwas set up to look into the\npresent constitution, byelaws and standing orders.\nThere are a lot of inconsistencies contained within the present Blue Book\nand these will be the first\nto be removed. It is also\nintended that there should\nbe some radical changes\nin certain areas of the\nUnion, e.g. Council, External Affairs. Another\nfailing of the present constitution is the lack of\ndefinition of what various\nofficers and representatives are actually expected\nto do. It is hoped that\neveryone, from the President down to department\nand floor reps, will eventually have some definition and guide-lines as to\ntheir purpose.\nThe first changes arising out of this will hopefully be seen at the first\nU GM this term. Standing\nOrders only require to be\npassed at one U GM with\nnotice having been given\nbeforehand. A new set of\nstanding orders, covering\nmost of the present points\nand also including several\nnew ones will be put before the meeting. It is\nhoped that these, combined with more efficient\nchairing, will greatly\nstreamline the running of\nthe Union Meetings with\nless chance of time-was t ing techniques. Copies of\nthese new standing orders\nshould be available soon\n(if not sooner) and comments on them will be\ngratefully received. Paul\nWadsworth, Hon. Sec,\nwill accept the comments\non these and on changes\nthat Union members\nwould like to see to the\nUnion Blue Book. Please\naddress all correspondence\non the matter to Paul, c/o the Union Office.\nNEXT MPE\nCOLL\nLEVEL TWO\nWALKWAY\nDear Mr. Fairbrother,\nIn my letter of 8 November I said that I had\nasked the College Secretary to seek a meeting\nwith you to examine your\nspecific complaints. He\nhas now reported to me.\nSome of the issues about\nwhich you complain are\nthose where College decisions have been taken\nwhich the Personnel Secretary is therefore instructed to implement; some\nare of a policy nature and\nrequire further consideration and discussion; and\nthere are others less significant, perhaps, which,\ngiven good will on both\nsides, it should be possible\nto resolve without acrimony or delay. No doubt,\nin all these issues, there\nmay be differences of interpretation of local or\nnational agreements. And\nperhaps there are, or will\nbe, genuine differences of\nopinion. That is inevitable,\nand it is why we need\nmachinery for settling our\ndifferences.\nFor my part, I intend\nto do what I can to ensure\nthat all sections contribute to the life of the\nCollege in the way best\nsuited to their talents and\nto the general good. What\nI am not prepared to do\nin any circumstances is to\nconduct business by way\nof deliberate misrepresentations and crude\nthreats. I reject entirely\nany statement or suggestion that the College has\nshown favour to one section of the staff against\nanother. I find particularly unacceptable the sort\nof intemperate language\nwhich, from my reading\nof the file, seems to characterise almost every\ncommunication from IC\nASTMS, both public and\nprivate. I would be reluctant to believe that your\nmembership, comprising\nso many of the excellent\nand loyal technical staff of\nthe College, subscribes to\nthis method of doing bus i ness.\nAlthough, therefore,\nsome policy issues are still\noutstanding and although\nour administrative methods will continue to\nrequire development to\ndeal with a changing set\nof problems, I propose to\ninstruct the College officers not to respond in\nfuture to communications\n(whether written or ver-bal) couched in the terms,\nfor example, of your\nletter to Mr, Malone of\nthe 29 November on Appeals Machinery.\nI trust that you will\nmake known to your\nmembers the contents of\nthis letter. I am myself\ncopying it to the Deans\nand to Heads of all Departments who may wish\nto circulate it more wide-ly.\nYours sincerely,\nBrian Flowers.\n\n"

The prohibition also applies to Saturday and Sunday.\nIt is not considered that the restrictions should lead to any necessity for\nre-timetabling.\nIn the event of the conditions arising in offices whereby it becomes\nimpossible, through lack of light, to\ncarry on working, Heads of Administrative Sections, at their discretion,\nmay allow staff to go home but not\nnormally before 4 p.m. Heads of Departments may wish to give similar\ninstructions.\nThe following College services and\namenities are not under restrictions\nand are to continue to operate, but\nwith due regard to the need for economy of use of lighting.\na) college and departmental libraries\nb) Refectories\nc) Sports Centre (less the swimming bath)\nd) Day Nursery and Health Centre.\nThe Union falls within the regulations but in different ways. As a recreational area it is virtually exempt from\nmost of the regulations but every\neffort must be made to keep the use\nof electricity to a minimum.\nPrivate parties are officially exempt\nbut if you feel it is necessary to have\na party, first preference will be given\nto those held on Monday, Tuesday\nor Wednesday. Outside bookings, if\nthey are of a private nature, are also\nexempt but with the same proviso as\nabove.\nUnion committees and official functions will be given preference over\nprivate parties over outside bookings\nbut again they are encouraged to be\nheld in the first three days of each\nweek.\nEntertainments of all types are\nexempt. The college has asked us,\nhowever, that once again functions\nbe held in the first three days of each\nweek as far as possible. A meeting\nwill be held during the week at which\nthere will foe discussion as to how\nit is possible to make as many events\nas possible fall within the three permissible days. It is likely that an\nefforts will be made to move the film\nshows (both ents and film soc) to the\nfirst three days of the week so, if\nyou are interested in the films, please\nkeep a careful watch out for notices\nindicating when and where the films\nare to be shown.\nIt is hoped that the concerts Will\nnot be affected. The ents committee\nwill be asked, however, to try and\nminimise the amount of electricity\nthat they use at the concerts.

    "content": "FELIX MIKE IS BACK\nAt the last Council of\nlast term there was a somewhat noisy and unconstitutional disturbance.\nAfter a term of tricky and\ndifficult negotiations\nDavid Sinclair (Deputy\nPresident) finally secured\nthe return of MIKE, Imperial College's long\nlost mascot. Its first showing was at the aforesaid\nmeeting where all its\noat tle scars were on dis-play. The crescent of the\nmicrometer is now painted blue and there is an\ninscription \"Queen Mary\nCollege 1971\" on the bar-rel. Mr. Sinclair assured\nCouncil, however, that\nafter a QM C minion had\nbeen made to unscrew\ncompletely and then re-screw MIKE( no mean\nfeat with a30cm gap), he\nwas satisfied that the\nscrew thread was in good\nworking order.\nIt was necessary, due to\nthe fact that QM C \"played dirty\" and did\nnot have MIKE on dis-play, to buy it back and it\nis hoped to have some\nfund raising activities to\ncover the cost.\nAlthough MIKE is now\nlocked safely away it\nshould be available for\nviewing at some public\nfunction or meeting and\nfrom thence, eventually,\nto go on \"permanent\" display again. This time the\nsecurity will be more\nsecure.\nAnyone interested in\nmascot ry should contact\nWooden Horse Organisation, c/o David Sinclair.\nANTED\nPAINT STRfPPtEf.\nD. SINCLAIR X COUNTRY\nFrom the latest edition\n, is Own Sporting\nLife; Cross Country Capers, featuring Rob Allinson and his committee . . .\nThat Wednesday, after\nChristmas Dinner in the\nrefectory, Rob Allinson\nand his chums at the P Consort Academy gathered together for the\noccasion of their Annual\n'Andicap. Now Rob, who\nhad worked out all the\nhandicaps the day before\nduring Prep, announced\nthat he himself would not\nbe running. Amidst thunderous gasps of shocked\nsurprise it was revealed\nthat he was suffering from\nthe effects of the previous\nevening's dormitory break-fast. The amazement of\nthe group was further\ncompounded at the arrival\n\u2022 f the day's transport.\nFor, there arriving in its\nfall glory and splendour\nwas the most luxurious\nand shining (nay, gleaming even) minibus they\nhad seen the past three\nmonths, (and hired from\nRoland's Coach Curiosities too!), with actual\nseats (!) and steering that\ndidn't pull to one side. So\nstunned were they that the\njourney to Petersham\nwas completed in silence\nsave for a few sneezes and\ndazed remarks of \"Eee!\nGrand eh?\". Many were\nthe looks of wonderment\non their faces, and Steve,\ndriving, was observed to\nsmile.\nLet not those who were\nso unfortunate as to miss\nthis occasion be forgotten;\nfor suffering under the\nministrations of Matron\nin the Sanatorium were\nnearly half of Rob's usual\nfollowers, though Ian and\nAlf had escaped through\nthe back window to come\nto watch the race. Unfortunately there was no\nroom on the minibus, and\nbesides their afflictions\nwere feared contagious, so\nthey were dispatched via\nGreen Line with Rob to\nquarantine them from the\nother passengers.\nAs to the race itself: 5^\nmiles is a long way, and it\nwas not without great\ncourage that Pete, Pad,\nand Andy led the field off,\nfollowed some two minutes later by Rob Maddison with Mike and Dave\njust behind and the rest of\nthe crowd several more\nminutes later. Dave Jones\nhad two great advantages:\nfirst, not having had any\nChristmas dinner, and\nsecond, a good handicap;\nand spurred on by certain\nremarks made by Mike to\nthe effect that he needed\nsomeone to pace him, he\nsoon drew well away and\ncaught and passed Rob\nMaddison at the Pimple,\nand by further untold\nefforts passed Pete in\nBlacke Deathe, and Pad\nand Andy at the Plantation. Thus having attained\nthe lead he slowed down.\nHowever his momentum\nat this point was so great\nthat it carried him\nthrough the Pen Ponds\nand over the Hill to the\nfinish without anybody\ncatching him, though\nRich Harrington had\nworked his way up\nthrough the field and,\ngiven a quarter mile more\nwould, no doubt, have\ncaught him. Behind Rich\nwas Pad and behind him\nthe rest of the gang, almost everyone finishing\nwithin a minute. This\nbrought great acclaim to\nRob for his handicapping.\nPete was congratulated on\nfinishing last two years in\na row and was informed\nthat the object was to\nreally win.\nThat night there was an\nofficial club bean feast at\nthe Academy. When last\nseen several of the newer\nmembers ' of the gang\nwere observed to be rather green about the gills.\nThe following day their\nmysterious disappearance\nwas noted and the ques-tion, \"Will we ever see\nthem again?\", heard.\nSTOIC PROGRAMME SCHEDULE Week beginning January 7th,1974 Tuesday, 8th January, 1974\n12.55 BBC Television News.\n13.00 The Term Ahead on STOIC.\n13.05 How to pass exams.\nRichard Woodhead gives sound advice on how to beat tit*\nexaminers.\n13.15 LIGHT.
