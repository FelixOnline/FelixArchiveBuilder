They must have been pretty dazed, since the FELIX reporter saw them arrive at the head of the I.C. procession at Hyde Park. Also at the demo, one of one of the college Broadsheets* editors took his camera with the intention of printing some of the photos he took in his organ. However, on his return, he found that he' d forgotten to remove the lens cap of his camera!1 See FELIX for the only comprehensive picture coverage of the demo.\nAnd finally, demo wise, we understand that of the150 members of I.

It's thus a convenient time to look at \"the\nstory so far\", as well as\n\"what's in store for this\nterm\".\nThe highlight of last\nterm was the submission\nto the Board of Studies of\na paper reviewing the Diversification of First Degree\nCourses. Many departments allow, or even insist,\nthat studies include diversified subjects, both to provide a more general edu-cation, and to increase the\nawareness of the scientist\nor engineer in society.\nThis trend was welcomed\nby our own Governing\nBody, especially in view\nof the increasing numbers\nof our graduates entering\ndiverse career fields. Unfortunately, there are still\na few departments where\nno such options are avail-able.\nAs a result of the discus-sion, the spirit of the paper\nwas commended to all de-partments, and more detailed discussion was\nencouraged in depart-ment s. Also, the appointment of an \"Academic\nDirector\" at Professorial\nYOU CAN MAKE \u00a31,000,000!!\n. . . . just by getting \u00a310,000,000 worth of advertising.\nBecome an advertising representative for FELIX and make\n10 per cent commission on all the ad revenue you get. It's easy,\nit's fun, and a super way of making yourself some honest cash. No\nframing necessary, just a little time and patience.\nWant to know more? Run, jump, scream for or telephone the\nFELIX Careers Recruiting Officer, John B. Stares, at Linstead 333\nor the FELIX Office.\nlevel, to co-ordinate and\nstimulate progress in this\nfield, will be made before\nthe start of next session.\nDepartmental staff-stud-ent committee systems\nwere discussed at some\nlength last term, and on\nthe whole were thought to\nbe functioning satisfactorily. Their development into central discussion forums continues, and the\nlinks between these committees and the Union are\nvery strong, thanks to the\"\nDepartmental Reps.\nHowever, there still\nseems to be a reluctance\nto \"recognise\" staff student committees in the college infra-structure, and\ncommunication on this\nside could be greatly im-proved.\nThis term sees us looking in detail at tutorial and\nassessment systems, as\nwell as the Union-wide discussions on the democratic organisation of the\ncollege. So if you've any\nstrong views on these sub-j ect s, just drop a note into\nthe Union Office.\nWell, do you know when\nyour next staff-student\ncommittee meeting is?\nUnion Tea Party\nOn Thursday of last week\nthere occurred a Union Meeting\nin the Great Hall. However, to\ncall it this requires a good many\nmore people than actually\nturned up. There could hardly\nhave been more than 100 and\nthis dwindled steadily through\nthe whole, long, boring one and\na half hours. The dictionary\ndefines \"boring\" as \"to weary\nby uninteresting talk\" and I couldn't agree more.\nStopping now would give an\naccurate account of this disaster but as some important\ntopics were dragged to the surface by various people sitting\nat the front I must continue.\nAfter the reading of the\nminutes the president woke up\nto challenge the quorum. Dave\nAmos then informed us that this\nmeeting of ICU would now be\nknown as \"a gathering of IC\nstudents\". This, therefore, invalidated all the votes taken\nlater although Dave Hobman\nsaid the discussion would help\nto formulate the executives'\nideas on certain subjects.\nThere were three main topics\nto be discussed: Piers Corbyn;\nNorthern Ireland; NUS emergency conference on Jan. 29/30.\nAt the last meeting Piers spent\nthe whole time talking about\nhimself and as a consequence\nthe rest of the agenda had to\nbe postponed until Thursday.\nThese two subjects would in\nthemselves have taken a long\ntime without the first three-quarters of an hour being taken up\nby Piers himself. He spent this\ntime in congratulating himself\nand others in their magnificent\nstruggle against the politically\ninspired attempt of the college\nto expel him. In the process he\naccused John McCullough of\nhelping them and said he considered the union vote in his\nfavour as one of no-confidence\nin the president. Annoyance (or\nwas it dismay?) flickered across\nhis face as he was told then\nthat the assembly had no power\nto pay his solicitor's fees and\nthat he would have to wait for\nthe next meeting before this\ncould be discussed.\nThe Northern Ireland motion\nwas sensibly put forward by\nJohn Sommer as a counter to\nthe likely massive support for\nthe IRA at the emergency con-ference. The essence of this\ndocument is the belief that violence of any kind cannot produce an acceptable solution and\nonly a political answer can be\nlasting. As this has not had your\nsupport the motion will go to\nthe conference under the heading of external affairs. Piers had\nrecommended that the whole\ndocument be changed with the\nmost ridiculous statement \"ICU\nbelieves that the British Army is\nimperialist\" giving the general\nlevel of his alterations.\nBy this time the first hour and\none quarter had just passed and\nit was difficult to decide who\nwas more bored; the president\nor the vice-president. Things\nlivened up a bit, however, when\nthey started shouting at each\nother over the amount of business included in each meeting.\nAnother quarter of an hour was\ntoo much and the \"group of IC\nstudents\" quietly dissolved.\nNow of course you will say,\n\"Well I'm glad I didn't go. It was\njust as bad as I thought it would\nbe\". But you are making a fundamental mistake. Of course, it\nwas badly advertised, badly laid\nout, badly planned (?), but these\nthings are only likely to change\nif enough people can be bothered to come along. The worst\nstriking thing is the amount of\nstudents at a meeting discussing\na controversial issue. However,\nthe important everyday business\nof a union is rarely interesting\nbut it must be supported. There\nis little point fighting to save\nyour union if no one wants to\nmake use of its most important\naspect. We might as well have a purely social organisation with\nno power to affect college policy.\nThink twice before missing\nthe next one!\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX Thursday, 27th January, 1972\nREVIEWS\nI 've been writing about\nfilms over the last term\nand have scarcely mentioned the Film Society.\nOn the 4th February in the\nGreat Hall we are showing\nBarney Piatts-Mills' BRONCO BULLFROG, which I mentioned when I reviewed his second film \"Private\nRoad\" last term. Barney\nPlatts-Mills is perhaps the\nmost promising British\nDirector to have emerged\nin recent years. There is\nthe same basic theme \u2014\nthe conflict between personal aspirations and the\nrestraints of society, but\nPlatts-Mills has focused his\nattention on Del, a young\nEast Ender in a steady,\nbut soul destroying, job as\na welder and the film tells\nof his attempts to escape\nfrom this mainly to be\nalone with Irene, his girl\nfriend. Bronco Bullfrog\nhas great glamour for Del\nFILMS in that he has escaped\nfrom Borstal. Del takes\nIrene for a trip to the West\nEnd which ends abortive ly in a Wimpy bar. Del's motor bike and their\nattempts to start a new life\nin the country are all des-troy ed. The film ends\nabruptly where it is obvious that Del and Irene\nmust bow to society's demands in order to survive.\nIt sounds very pessimistic,\nbut even at the most pessimistic points the characters always seem to extract\nexcitement and impromptu\nfun from their environment.\nFilmed with an entirely\namateur cast, from an improvised script this film is\nexcellent. For a first film\nfrom a British director it is\nvery good and due to the\nlack of either sex or violence in the film it is unlikely to obtain a general\nrelease in this country. So\non the 4th February at 7.15\np.m. in the Great Hall I.C. gets its chance. Also we\nare showing Vittorio De\nSica's1948 classic \" Bi cycle Thieves\".\nAt last year's(1971) London Film Festival the\nfilm that opened the Festival was Jacques Tati's latest film TRAFFIC. Eventually I caught up with the\nfilm and it has been very\ndifficult to review. There\nwere several very funny\nparts and many other parts\nthe rest of the audience\nfound funny (perhaps they\nweren't in as much difficulty with the French as I was\u2014a few subtitles help;\nplease distributors!), but\noverall the film was a little\npatchy, with long stretches\nwhen nothing happened.\nA very disappointing film\ncompared with his 1952\n\" M. Hulot's Holiday\".\nCENTENARY TOUCHSTONE Saturday, 4th December\n1971 saw the start of the\n\" Centenary Touchstone \"\n\u2014the 100th touchstone\nsince Sir Rodericks Hill\ninstigated the idea over 20\nyears ago.\nThe concept of \"Touch-stone weekends\" has\nchanged little since its inception and was admirably\nexplained in the last Felix\nTouchstone report. Something of a nostalgic feeling\nwas instilled into the\ngroup by the arrival, from\nLever Bros. Ltd., of a replica of the original Touchstone symbol. A Port\nSunlight soapbox. The box\nis admirably referred to as\n\"the box of free speech\"\nwith the additional rider\n\"but not free licence\". A pity.\n\"America & Asia \u2014 a clash of cultures?\" the\nweekend's topic, seemed\nto cover the whole field of\ndiscussion. Philip Calkins,\nProfessor of Indian History\nat Chicago University was\navailable as Guest Speaker\nto start the ball rolling and\nthen, very subtly and tact-fully, guide it in the right\ndirection. The Professor\nwas much more the American academic: friendly,\nsociable, young and interested \u2014 some contrast to\nsome of his British counter-parts.\nMuch was said. The\nspeaker felt we were questioning whether Western\ntechnology was something\nwhich could be given to\nunderdeveloped nations,\nprovided we overcame\nconservative, peasant and\nreligious prejudices.\nDo you regard the East\nas exotic? \u2014 almost cer-tain ly; if not, your mind will\nprobably conjure pictures\nof religious ceremonies, or\na caste system, or just\npoor, overpopulated people. The exotic view\nhas certainly persisted\nsince Colonial times. Indeed, it has been enc our aged. The East cultivated\nthe religious view for being subject.\nAmerica, the speaker\nfelt, had regarded herself\nas the protector of the\nChinese peoples\u2014it never\nhad been, and was understandably hurt, like an\n\"unwanted parent\", by the\nCommunist success in\n1948.\nThe title certainly proved sufficiently provocative\nto attract two American\nstudents to the discussion,\nthough as a first-timer, I couldn't help feeling that\nthe group was based on a very hard core of re gu lars. This is not by encouragement, and all are we l come.\nI really think it's a pity\nthat more people don't try\na Touchstone weekend. It\nis only \u00a31. The next Touchstone speaker will be Mary\nWhitehouse. I 've booked.\nRORY GALLAGHER\" DEUCE\"( POLYDOR)\nWhen Rory Gallagher\nperforms on stage he gives\nhis audience the thumbs\nup sign quite a lot and\nstomps about continuously. He is undoubtedly\none of the most exciting\nperformers in Britain to-day, but has the advantage\nover other \"exciting\" performers in that he is an\nexcellent guitarist, particularly on slide guitar where\nhe ranks with Johnny Winter and the late Duane\nAllman. Don't miss the\nchance to see him in the\nGreat Hall this weekend.\nIn the past, however, the\nexcitement of his music\nseemed to melt away on\nrecord. The temptations of\nDISCS overdubbing in a modern\nstudio must have been too\nmuch because he introduced jazzy alto-sax which\nsounded o.k. but just\ndidn't make it compared\nto the raw rock which we\nknew he was capable of.\nOnly \"Live Taste\" was\nable to capture the atmosphere he engendered.\nBut this album is more\nwhat I had in mind.\nAlmost certainly recorded\nlive in a studio with a bit\nof crude production here\nand there, and the result is\nthe best album he's done.\nOf course it's not just the\nfeedback that makes it so\ngood. The songs are a lot\nmore meaningful than the\n\"I got a woman she's so\nmean\" lyrics with which\nhe's been associated. And\nthere's bassist Gerry McAvoy and drummer Wilgar\nCampbell, so often overshadowed by Rory but\nboth very competent. As\nwell as the straight-ahead\nrockers like \"In Your\nTown\" (the best track)\nthere are Rory's attempts\nto get into a purer blues\nbag, like \" Should've\nLearn't My Lesson\" and\n\"Out of My Mind\", which\nsounds a lot like Don\nPartridge (remember?).\nBut most of the tracks\njump off the turntable and\npunch you in the guts. A fine album.\nLate last term 1 went to\nsee \"Dear Antoine\" and\n\" A Day in the Death of Joe\nEgg\", both of which have\nnow, unfortunately, closed.\nBoth deserved the highest\npraise \u2014\n+ \"Joe Egg\" for\nthe grey comedy with\nwhich Peter Nichols colours his picture of parents\ncaring for their 'vegetable'\nchild, and \"Dear Antoine\"\nfor Anouilh's slowly revealed depths of emotion\nand a magnificent \"Coup\nde Theatre\" in the third\nact.\nBut David Storey's \"The\nChanging Room\" (Globe)\nstill lives. The play is set in\nthe Changing Room of a Rugby League Club, and\nits three acts occur before,\nduring and after a match,\nas the players arrive and\nchange, come in at halftime and are treated and\nencouraged, and, eventually bath and drift away,\nPLAYS less the one broken-nosed\nplayer. There are none of\nthe usual motive-laden\nspeeches and all that we\nlearn of the players is\nfrom their chatter \u2014 anything else would have torn\nthe thin fabric of total\ncredibility. The fascination\nin the play comes from\nwatching these thirteen\nplayers come together (all\nare part-time, though not\namateurs) and weld themselves into a unified team,\ngradually dissembling at\nthe end. The image is of\nmen at work, not of actors\npretending to be something they are not, and if\nI mention none of the cast\nby name it is only because\nthey are uniformly good.\nLindsay Anderson of\n\"If . . . \" and \" Home\" directs this transfer from\nthe Royal Court.\n\"Getting On\"( Queen's) was ultimately slightly disappointing by contrast.\nAlan Bennett (who wrote\nthe excellent and successful \"40 Years On\") has\nwritten a great play with\nGeorge (Kenneth More), a middle-aged M.P. just\narriving, with his younger\nwife (Gemma Jones), at\nthe point in their existence\nwhen they realise that they\nare \"getting on\" in age as\nwell as career. Thrown in\nare a comic Mother-in-Law,\nmisunderstood son, queer\nParliamentarian and seductive decorator, to complete Bennett's comic six.\nThere is a lot of very\nfunny material in the first\nthree-quarters of the play,\nbut then the play changes\ndown into a series of from-the-heart dialogue with, I am sorry to say, a drastic\ncrashing of its dramatic\ngear-box. The play is good,\nbut it could have been\nbetter.\nTHe Land snap pE PS\nnE B2B "

You pays\nyour money and you takes\nyour choice. But, I hear\nyou at the back cry, what\nmoney? Grant? A good ticket for a West End play\nwill cost about \u00a31.50 or so,\nbut there are places which\nare Arts Council or otherwise subsidized and are\nthus cheaper. It is therefore the solemn duty of this\narticle to give an impression of what is available at\nstudent rates and what (in\nmy view) is worthwhile\nthat is not. The list is by\nno means comprehensive\nand is rather subjective.\nTough. Blame Sugden.\nShaw Theatre\nf twix t Euston and St. Paneras).\nMichael Croft, founder\nof the splendid \"National\nYouth Theatre\", set up the\nprofessional Dolphin Company at the Shaw, largely\nwith the help of Camden\nCouncil. The aim is \"To\nprovide good Theatre at\nprices young people can\nafford\"; so, on production\nof a Student Card, you zan\nget a pretty good seat for\n25p. The productions are\ngenerally straightforward\nand textual, especially the\nShakespeare, and this will\ncertainly be true of the\nforthcoming \"Romeo and\nJuliet\" (of which the Young Vic managed to\nmake such a mess). The\nset-up is remarkably plush,\nwith a nicely modern auditorium and about the longest Theatre bar in London.\nFriendly folks, but be careful about opening the 'en-v elope' programmes. They\nspill everywhere.\nYoung Vic\n(near Old Vic, Waterloo).\nMichael Croft was consistently refused Arts\nCouncil money to set up\nthe Dolphin Company, but\nOlivier's sidekick Frank\nhand-in-yer-pocket Dunlop\ngot a brand new Theatre,\nplus working capital without having to ask twice.\nAll tickets are 40p, for\nwhich the director demonstrates how much cleverer he is than the play-wright, especially Shakespeare. But don't let me put\nyou off. Book next door at\nthe National's office.\nAlmost Free\nTheatre\n(Rupert Street, near Picadilly Circus).\nEd Berman, or Professor\nR.L. Dogg (Dogg R.L \u2014\nget it?) of Inter-Action\nProductions runs this curious centre for three fringe\ncompanies (including his\nown \"Dogg's Troupe\")\nproviding theatre at any\nprice you want to pay for\na ticket. As well as evening performances there are\nlunch-time performances\nstarting at 1.15 p.m., finishing about 2 p.m. Despite\ntheir seemingly suicidal\nfinancial policy the place\nexudes an air of artistic\nendeavour \u2014 whether this\nwill survive when the novelty wears off is open to\nspeculation. Don't expect\nice-cream in the interval,\nbut just mutter about Pinter, Surrealism, how well\nlone sco did this, and how\nimportant it all is, and you\nshould pass off as trendy.\nRoyal Court\n(Sloane Square).\nThe Court is the only\nTheatre in U.S.K., and is,\nas the home of the English Stage Company, Arts\nCouncil subsidized. Any\ntickets unsold by 5 minutes before the performance are sold to students\nfor 25 pence. There has\nbeen a good run of\nplays from here recently \u2014 \"The Philanthropist\", \"The Contractor\",\n\"Home\" (recently te levi sed), \"The Changing\nRoom\" and \"West of\nSuez\" have all attained\nWest End transfers. Small\n(440 seats) and pleasant.\nThe Theatre Upstairs is\nthe Court's experimental\nwing, and as such produces anything sufficiently\nnovel to attract critical at-tent ion. National Theatre\nat the Old Vic\n(Waterloo).\nThe Larry Olivier Mob. It\nis critically fashionable to\nslate the National at the\nmoment, but they are not\nat all bad and the sickly-comic \"The National\nHealth\" is well worth see-ing. No cheap student sates I'm afraid, but the gallery is great fun (seated\n15p, or standing 10p). Programmes are rather ex pen sive, though you do get a cast list free, and bars are\nplentiful. So are Student\nNurses in the gallery.\nRoyal\nShakespeare\nCompany\nat the Aldwych\nWorld-wide, probably\nthe best English-speaking\nCompany just now, but\nOld Bill would not recognise much of the material in current repertoire here\u2014only one of the\nplays is his, and that (Mid-summer Night's Dream) is\na Peter Brook directorial\nrehash. Like the National,\nthis gang are getting a brand-new multi-million\npound Theatre in the near\nfuture, so they are worth\nseeing just for the sake of\nkeeping an eye on your\ninvestment. However, once\nagain, like the National\nthere are no Student Re\nduct ions as such, but reductions and other benefits can be obtained by\njoining the R.S.C.

Much more surprising\nwas the fact that this was\na three-day trip . . . to\nParis!\nAll this, long since past,\nhappened at t ne beginning\no* last term. Hoverlloyd,\nthe private company providing a Gross-Channel\nhovercraft service had\nwritten making the offer.\nTo gain publicity, they\nchose to invite (from all\nthe London colleges) a Felix reporter for the ride.\nThe itinerary was explained simply as three\ndays in Paris, travelling\nthere on the first day and\nback again on the last. We\nwere to travel by a sandwich combination of\nCoach Hovercraft Coach. Little more was\nsaid until the departure\nday gradually drew closer.\nI went to the bank and\nwithdrew my life savings\nso that I could at least\ntake advantage of the duty\nfree opportunity that return\nwould offer and then\nwaited.\nOn a typically cold December morning I got up at\nthe unusually early hour of\n7.00 a.m., four hours sleep\nbehind me, and packed,\nate and made my way to\nVictoria Coach Station.\nThe Coach Station was\nempty, almost ghostly I thought when I arrived, but\nthe coach was there. The\nengine was running, warming the coach for the coming run to Ramsgate. A charming chatty bird arrived a bit later. That\ncheered me. Another one,\nyounger but almost as\ncharming arrived after (I prefer 'em experienced)\nand we set off. Not quite\nas simple a journey as Iwo u id nave liked, because\nit transpired that tn ere were some other men coming too. hours after we\ngot to Ramsgate\u2014hell, is\nt ne M2 boring!\nRamsgate Hoverterminal\nis like a mini-airport\u2014\na Hoverport they call it.\nEnvironmentalists may re-memo er the pro oie ms hover lloyd had in persuading Pegweil Bay loc a is that\nwhat t ney had a i ways wanted was a hover port in\ntheir front gardens. Hoverlloyd won and a local who\nwas with us tried to assure\nme that the peasants\nwere now convinced. I mig nt have been, had not\nthis particular person\nspent the whole summer\nworking for the very\npeople organising the trip!\nIn fairness the Hoverport\ndoes not look too out of\npi ace, and considering it\ncost \u00a31.5 million to build,\nit's not badly finished\neither.\nWe saw a Hovercraft\nfrom the terminal. A big\nthing, its large snout open,\nready to swallow the first\n35 cars that might come its\nway. Like Seaspeed (BR's service) Hoverlloyd operate BH C SR.N4's, now referred to as the Mountbatten Class. These things are\ncertainly impressive, capable of carrying up to 60\nton disposable loads at\nspeeds of over 50 knots.\nAfter a while we board-ed, the local rag's photographer took our photo\n(never happened to me\nbefore!) and the craft\nrose, gently cresting the\nwaves and speeding into\nthe Channel \u2014 soon to\ncross those notorious\nGoodwins. The hostesses\ncame round after a while\noffering their wares\n(drinks, etc.), (One word\nabout the hostesses\u2014they\nare not up to airline stand-ard s, at least in looks,\nmost look like 30-40 year\nold housewives).\nPeople's reactions by\nthis stage are variable,\nsome go very white. I found the sensation of travelling in big hovercraft\nexhilarating. Previously in\nthe year I had crossed the\nSoient in a Seaspeed\nside-wall craft, but this\nwas really something completely different. After a while we were invited up-top. (I forget whether it\nwas the bridge or the\ncockpit). The pilot (1 re-memo er that bit) perched\nupon a high seat had a vastly superior view than\nthe passengers below him.\nA whole array of instruments before him, his lot is\nvery similar to that of an\nairline pilot. Gradually\nthey showed us almost\neverything about the craft\n(except a look under the\nskirt). Very safe I thought!\nI might say that I have\nsince met someone they\nnearly mowed down mid-channel.\nThe French terminal was\nless impressive. Smaller,\nyet with much more officious staff \u2014 altogether\nFrench. (Don't be surprised if I say I really like\nthem). There is, however,\na plaque to somebody or\nother\u2014a load of cock.\nThe worst part was to\ncome and I think I should\nsay, by choice, I would not\ntravel from London to\nParis by Hovercraft. Four\nhours in a comfortable\nFrench coach wouldn't be\ntoo bad if it were com-for table, if it had been\nwarmer, and if the driver\nhadn't chosen to stop in\nthe middle of nowhere\nwith little to see except\nrow upon row of British\nWW1 war graves; what a lovely war.\nINTERNATIONAL FRUSTRATION\"\nLord Cara donatI. C. Many problems exist at the\nUnited Nations; it should be re\nnamed \"International Frustration\", said Lord Caradon whilst\nspeaking at I.C. by invitation ot\nThird World First\u2014U.N.S. A. Although he spoke only of\nimmediate conflicts, he stated\nthat the more important issues\nsuch as Race, Poverty and\nPopulation should not be over-looked.\nA major problem at the U.N., he continued, was that its\nmembers tried to assert their\nnationalist policies at an international level. He had little\nsympathy for people who criticised the United Nations for\nfailure to solve problems. The\nagreement made in San Francisco resulting in the foundation of the United Nations is\nstill as valid and correct now\nas it was then. People tend to\nthink of the U.N. as a large\nimpersonal organisation which\ncan solve any problems. Unfortunately, they always come\ntoo late with their problems\nwhen they have succeeded in\nmaking a mess of them. However, by condemning the U.N'., they are only condemning\nthemselves and their own failure\nto reach a reasonable con clu sion.\nHe also warned of the \"com-place n cy\" of the predominantly\nwhite minority that controls\nmost of the world's wealth\nwhilst largely ignoring the presence of the coloured majority\nof the world's population that\"\nis suffering from poverty, overpopulation and illiteracy. This\nproblem, he believes, is one of\nthe greatest that has ever faced\nmankind.\nLord Caradon went on to explain the function and usefulness ot the U.N. First its use as\nan \"International Forum\" where\nall nations' views can be heard.\nBy way of illustration he recalled that four years ago, Malta\nhad called for a resolution declaring sea-bed mineral resources the property of all\nmankind. This resolution gained\nsupport and was finally accepted unanimously, clearly demonstrating how a small country\ncan contribute to important\ninternational policies.\nHis second point was that\nthe U.N. provides a unique situation for good contact between\nhigh-ranking officials of most\ncountries and the eventual\nunderstanding of most problems. He gave vivid details of\nhow he walked back and forth\ndown 3rd Avenue in New York\ntrying to settle Arab and Israeli\nproblems and how with his personal understanding with a Russian representative, the Soviet\nUnion did not veto a proposition for its own sake. Whereas\nin the good old days, a diplomat was forced to travel from\ncountry to country, he can now\ndo most of his business at the\nU.N. This has led to \"A New\nParliamentary World Diplomacy\" with a public declaration\nof the results obtained. In other\nwords, a problem has to be\nsolved, or failure admitted. He\npointed out that the Paris\nPeace Talks between North and\nSouth Vietnam, the Vietcong\nand the U.S.A. have and probably will fail to reach a conclusion for this reason.\nFinally, he spoke of the ability of the U.N. to act as a \"Machine for International Development\", to alleviate poverty\nby population and other con-tro ls. He quoted the case of\nJamaica, which received a large\ninflow of cash after the discovery of bauxite. Whilst schools\nand hospitals were being built,\nthe population (which nobody\nwas concerned about) was rising so rapidly as a result, that\nafter ten years, the people were\nworse off. Other countries have\npopulation problems, e.g. India,\nwhere it is increasing at 1\nmillion a month, clearly this\nproblem must be solved before\nany raising in the standard of\nliving can occur.\nRace, poverty and population\nare the international problems\nof the future, but certain political problems still exist. For ex-ample, the Conference on the\nEnvironment in Stockholm is\nimperilled by the political considerations of E. Germany.\nLord Caradon continually\nemphasised the policy of success on the international scene\nthat is required, rather than victory on the nationalist scale. He\nanswered several questions and\nemphasised this in his replies.\nOn being questioned on Northern Ireland, he replied that ne\nwas not familiar with the situation there which was the reason\nfor his inclusion in the recent\nB.B.C. investigation.\nAltogether, he is to be congratulated on a fine delivery, a very amusing, eloquent and\nagreeable talk.\nMcLooge Expands\nParis had changed little\nsince I had last visited her.\nThere's little to tell those\nwho have been and for\nthose who haven't, well\nyou should.\nWe were wined and\ndined both nights by our\nhosts. The food was good,\nthe wine was ordinaire,\nand the meal took a long\ntime to eat. My Whole day\nin Paris was spent oh r issy shopping, etc., having\nbeen unable to rise before\n12.00 noon due to the\neffects of the meal (etc.)\nthe night before.\nReturn was the same as\ngoing. Even to the names\non those crosses (you\nwould not forget them\neither if you saw them). A companion joined our fold\nfor the return. She was\ncalled Irene, was attractive, talked know i edge ably and enjoyed the ride. I mention this because she\nwas probably the fairest\ntest. She had wanted to\ntravel the cheapest way\nand time was immaterial.\nDuty free laden, and\nvery tired, I returned to\nLinstead about 50 hours\nafter I left. I had spent 15\ntravelling and about 8\nsleeping and I had enjoyed\nit.\nWe're now getting well into\nthe second term and the Union\nAutonomy issue is still tending\nto dwarf some other issues, including:\u2014\nDIVERSIFICATION\nFollowing the Board of Studies Meeting in November, when\nthe idea of an Academic Director was accepted and the\nadoption of more diversified\ncourses was encouraged to de-partments, the Registrar sent a note to all Heads of Department\nasking them to pursue the matter further. This departmental\nlevel of representation is where\nthe chance of true participation\nin College government might be.\nA new course \u2014 \"Science in\nSociety\" is being prepared by\nthe Industrial Sociology Unit and\nhopefully will be introduced into\nmost de pts. next year. Get details off Chris Sheppard (Civil\nEngineering Dept. Rep.), and\nuse your staff/student Committee\nto make sure your Dept. gives\nyou this course as an option\nnext year.\nPOSTGRADUATES Whilst P.G.' s are in no way\ndiscriminated against by the\nUnion e.g.) Grants rises,\nRavenscourt Pk. Flats, Student\nWelfare Services, Sports Facilities. Entertainments, STOIC,\nFelix, Clubs, etc., nevertheless\nthe involvement of postgraduates within Union activities\nalways seems to fall well short\nof that of undergraduates and\nsome of the P.G. problems that\nare peculiar to them e.g.) Lab.\nsafety, Demonstrating Fees, etc.,\npossibly don't get enough dis-cus sion. This may largely stem\nfrom the greater isolation of\nP.G.' s, both from U.G.' s and\nalso other fellow P.G.' s. To combat this the Union Council will\nbe considering in the near future\nplans for aP.G. affairs officer\nand P.G. association.\nREPRESENTATION\nThis has been a silent subject for the last year or so, but\nstill the Union lacks representation in such areas as choosing\nHall wardens, membership of\nthe Deans' Committee, etc.\nSTUDENT WAGE In the midst of Press discussions of the Consultative Document Proposals, there was a report in the Times of a reconsideration of the loans for P.G.' s question. It is in this context that\nstudents must develop the concept of a student wage\u2014a lot\nof the work P.G.' s do is put to\nuse for industry, government,\netc.\u2014P.G.' s should get paid for\nthis work. The concept of a student wage is now widely accepted by students\u2014we must now\napply it to areas of difficulty,\ne.g., long vacations, nature of\nstudy, etc. to fix our own boundary condition that would make it\nfeasible and not just a weapon\nwith which students could be\neven more regimented by Colleges, e.g.) Southampton, where\nsome P.G.' s have to clock in,\nand must work a minimum of 40\nhours a week in the lab.\nMINERS' STRIKE\nMen, working in far from\npleasant conditions in many\ncases, are taking home wage\npackets of less than \u00a320 a week\nin a lot of cases. When there is\nan enforced overtime ban by\nthe N.C. B. as there has been\nrecently in many areas, these\nwage packets can drop as low\nas \u00a313-\u00a314. How can students,\nas a part of society, not want to\nadd their voice in this matter.\nIf you've got any comments\u2014\ncome and see us in the Union\nOffice.\n\n"

MINER SKIRMISHES A fight marred the start of the Demonstration on\nSunday against the government's proposals for Student\nUnions. It began when members of the Liaison Committee for the defence of Student Unions and sympathisers\nmoved forward and surrounded the platform at Hyde\nPark Corner when directions were being given to the\nassembled multitudes. They were insisting that a miner\nshould speak to them about their struggle for more\nmoney. Despite promises that a miner would be one of\nthe speakers at Trafalgar Square, the L.C.D.S. U. per-s is ted, shouting that they wanted one there and then,\nand scuffles broke out amongst the ranks. Eventually,\nafter informing them that the microphone was \"broken\",\nthe mob quiet e ned down and order was restored.\nImperial College, together\nwith the other USK colleges and\nthe Scottish contingent to whom\nI.C. had played host the previous night, started the march\nfrom Imperial Institute Road at\n12.15. I.C. was completely outnumbered by the others even\nat this stage\u2014there were, in\nfact, probably only about 200 at\nmost of us. In comparison to\nthis, there were at least twice\nas many from the rest of U.S.K., and as many again from the\nScottish universities. Flanked by\na goodly number of the fuzz,\nthey set off across Hyde Park to\njoin contingents from all over\nthe country at Hyde Park cor-ner.\nThere everyone was split into\n23 groups, depending on where\nthey came from. The Central\nLondon crew and those from\nWales were probably the largest crowds, whereas others\nwere quite noticeable by their\nabsence. The assembly there\nwas well organised and uneventful except for the scuffle mentioned above which happened\njust before everyone was due\nto move off at one o 'clock.\nMarching about eight abreast,\nthe demonstration went first\ndown Oxford Street, through the\nintricacies of the one-way system to Oxford Circus, down\nRegent Street, across Picadilly\nCircus and thence down Haymarket to Trafalgar Square. The\nNUS earlier predicted that\n100,000 would turn out for the\nmarch (which is decidedly optimistic\u2014the NUS only has\n450,000 members in the whole\ncountry); the official estimate\nat 1.40, by which time the march\nhad reached Oxford Circus, was\n20,000, and certainly, if they\nwere marching in the groups of\n4,000 that they were supposed\nto be in, that can't have been\nfar out. However, the march was\nall the same very impressive\u2014\nit took 40 minutes for it to pass\ndown Haymarket, from which I have just come.\nUnfortunately for the cause,\nmany students decided not to\ndemonstrate on behalf of Student Unions but for other causes\ninstead, notably that of the mine-workers. In fact, while standing\nat Hyde Park before departure,\nwhen the officials asked over\nthe loudspeakers whether everyone knew what they were demonstrating for, everyone tittered merrily\u2014but several near me\nshouted \"For the Miners!!\"\nThere were so many slogans\non the march that it could have\nbeen on behalf of almost any-thing. Of the dozen or so pas-s ers by that I asked, three\nthought that they were demonstrating for the miners, two for\nschool milk, and several others\nthought it was just a general\nanti-government march. One\neven thought that it was about\nabout Rhodesia. Only one knew\nwhat it was all about\u2014the rest\nwere don't knows and don't cares.\nAfter speeches from union\nofficials and leaders from the\nlabour party and trade unions\n2,000 of the demonstrators\nmoved on to the National Coal\nBoard headquarters, where they\nchanted slogans of solidarity\nwith the miners. Perhaps the\nNUM will have a demo for us,\nsome day.\nPiers returns\nto I.C.\"I am delighted and very grateful to all the students,\nmessengers and staff in I.C. and also up and down the\ncountry who were so vocal in their support; especially\nin political matters\".\nPiers Corbyn, in case you didn't know, has won his\nappeal against the decision of the College to expel him.\nIn fact, as Piers pointed out,\nsince he had been working all\nthrough the summer, he would\nThis simple statement gives\nno hint of the actual events behind the apparently suspicious\nbehaviour of the physics de-partment. After all the case is\nthe first to use the appeal system set up in 1966. What is\nneeded more than anything is\nan accurate record of what has\nbeen happening.\nPiers began his career with\na Royal Scholarship to I.C. where he wrote several scientific papers as an undergraduate\n(e.g. measuring the eccentricity\nof the Earth's orbit at home!).\nHe graduated with a1 st Class\ndegree in Physics, whereupon\nhe joined the Department to do\nresearch in Solid State Physics.\nHe passed D.I.C. Theoretical\nPhysics in 1969.\nIt was then that his political\nbeliefs became obvious and as\nPresident of I.C.U. in 1969-70\nhe was responsible for the distinctly left ish outlook of the\nUnion at that time.\nHe started research again in\n70/71 and became the editor of\nSennet. This is recognised by\nthe College as an \"accepted\nUniversity activity\".\nOver the summer vacation an\nattempt was made to expel him\non grounds of insufficient work.\nThis dragged on for three\nmonths when, in October, he\nwas allowed to remain only on\nthe grounds that he increased\nhis work considerably.\nAt this point the Physics Department (in the person of Professor Coles) and Piers began\nto differ on the account.\nPiers says that he thought the\nwarning in October had left him\nwith a \"clean sheet\" so far as\nhis college record went, and\nthat the letter informing him of\nhis expulsion came as a great\nshock.\nHowever, in a letter to Piers,\nProfessor Coles made it clear\nthat he never considered that\nthis was the case. Apparently,\nhe and Professor Matthews had\nassumed that since the \"derivative of his work rate\" had remained positive during August\nand September, there was a good chance that this would\ncontinue. It was on this basis\nthat Piers was to be allowed\nback.\nneed some form of holiday after\nthe possibility of expulsion had\nbeen hanging over his head for\nthree months. This would account for the drop in his work\nlevel.\nOne of the strongest points\nin favour of him is a latter written by one of the Department\nprofessors saying that he considers Piers Corbyn to have\ndone a sufficient amount of\nwork. This was later retracted\nfor some ill-defined reason but\nall sorts of possibilities spring\nto mind!\nIt also ape pars that he was\nhaving great personal difficulties\naround this crucial time. In his\nappeal to the physics department he goes into great detail\nabout a \"Mr. Farquerson and\nfriends\". Apparently Mr. Farquerson was a manic depressive and often invited anyone he\ncame across back to his flat.\nFor example, 6 male prostitutes\nand a \"Hello Angel\". Some\nAustralians who were living in\nthe flat made several calls to\nAustralia without saying and the\ngas meter was robbed by persons unknown. This resulted in\na telephone bill for \u00a3120 and\nan electricity bill for \u00a380!\nHe says that he probably\nmade an error of judgement in\nnot telling his supervisor (Prof.\nColes) of these troubles, and\nadmits that if he had asked for\na holiday at the time, the problem might have resolved itself.\nHaving read ail t he documents and letters cone c ted with\nthe case, it seems to me that\nthis is an unfortunate example\nof lack of communication between staff and students. The\nPhysics Department appears to\nhave acted very shortsightedly\nin its ace pt ance of the apparent\nfacts of the issue. Perhaps spurred on by a dislike of Piers'\npolitics they tried to get rid of\nhim when an excuse presented\nitself. Piers, as well, is guilty of\na similar lack of trust in his\nsupervisor.\nIf one thing is to be learnt\nfrom this unpleasant affair it is\nthat the appeals system appears\nto work, and is the best that can\nreasonably be expected.\n$i erg before t f je resolution "

What I am\ntrying to illustrate is the important question of priorities.\nIf you believe that Piers Corbyn has a reasonable case\nfor complaint then you should be at the union meeting\nto support it. If you think that he genuinely is a lazy\ngood for nothing and should be expelled from the college they you should be at the union meeting to stop\nhim spending YOUR money on his solicitors fees, not to\nmention his attempts to spend your money on I.R.A. bombs (you too can kill an Irish child). Whatever you\nbelieve in you have a duty to express your opinion at\nthe union meeting above almost every other duty you\nmay have.\nYou may, of course, think that unions are silly and\nhow many pints of beer you can drink are the more\nimportant part of your college life, after all would you\nbe as capable of damaging our halls of residence, etc.,\nwithout them. Once again you are entitled to your\nopinion but surely if you think that unions are silly you\nshould try and support Mrs. Thatcher's ideas in every\nway possible, as they are guaranteed to get rid of it\nfor you (be careful, it may also get rid of a couple of\nbars).\nAs however I have not seen anybody actively supposing Mrs. Thatcher I can only deduce that everybody\nwho joins this solid body of apathy believes in true\napathy. Good for you. I'm always pleased to see someone with the courage of his convictions, indeed at the\npresent rate I too may give up hope for the future and\njoin your masses. Oh! but can I do that if I have actually\ngone so far as to think about why I don't want to think\nabout anything. I'm confused, better go for a pint!\nReturning refreshed to my desk I am feeling more\nunderstanding towards the apathetic majority. It is an\nhistorical fact that people are always apathetic until\nthey are united by good leadership. I must agree with\nthe concensus of opinion in the college that the present\ntechnique of leadership breeds apathy in that it breeds\nboredom. If we are to save our union and simultaneously, I believe, a lot of our interest in life, we must\nurge our leaders to lead us or resign. This unfortunately\nwill never come to pass because to implement this we\nneed a quo rate union meeting.

I am convinced that Council in it's present form has ceased to perform\nas a useful and contributory\narea of ICU. Last night's mammoth session of 7i hours adequately illustrates this view in\nmy opinion.\nOn the agenda were some\nvitally important items, fundamental to the very aims and\nobjects of ICU, yet we were\nstifled by obstruction, pettiness\nand dogma. I would at this\npoint like to state quite categorically that all was not wasted.\nThere was some useful and\nmeaningful discussion, but even\nthis was clouded. Piers Corbyn's academic affairs have\nblown up again, in a very nasty\nfashion. Council showed unanimity of thought, although Piers\nwas somewhat evasive as to\nhow much work he has actually\ndone of recent. Other points\nwere dealt with moderately\nefficiently, such as Finance,\nMinutes of the last meeting,\netc., and most of the reports.\nThe one report that caused\ntrouble was the Entg. report. It\nwould appear that too many\npeople are rumour ing too much\nabout something they know all\ntoo little. Even the President's report was fairly uncontroversial l But then came the needle\nissues. Student Union autonomy\nand Structure of ICU. These two\nissues were reduced to a level\nof personal recrimination. I believe Council showed itself to\nbe unable to discuss vitally important topics in an adult and\nrational manner. Within a short\nspace of time, the entire debate was reduced to petty\nbickering. Council actually managed to pass judgement on an\nICUGM, the now infamous Dec.\n2nd meeting, condemning the\nfilibustering that led to the passing of a motion of dubious sup-port, and proceeded on the\nnext item of business to push\nthrough an amended amendment in a way that amounted\nto little less than filibustering\nagain. Council spent 45 minutes discussing a procedural\nmotion on a point of order on\nan amendment to a motion!\nBoth tempers and friends were\napparently lost in A\\ hours of\ntemporary insanity.\nI believe that Hobman and\nAmos were pushing their luck\nif they really thought that their\nmotion would be passed or\neven discussed fully. It was perhaps foolhardy to even propose\nsuch an extreme motion as the v did. Whether they proposed it\nout of sheer spite, as was suggested openly at Council, I wouldn't like to say, but I would like to think that Hobman\nand Amos are more responsible\nthan that.\nThe opposers of the motion,\nI believe, stifled discussion to\nachieve its defeat and aid the\nsubstitution of their own, with\nthe result that the whole issue\nwas inadequately debated. The\namended motion was then\neffectively destroyed by further\namendments. We reached a point when, after about 4 hours,\nan amendment was proposed\nand passed which negated all\nthat had been decided over the\npast 4 hours. It was at this\npoint that ritual suicide\noccurred. Council then voted to\nignore the vote they had just\npassed, quite democratically at\nthat, and rev ots on the amend-ment. Fortunately it was wit tv drawn before any further damage could be delivered.\nThe amended motion was\npassed in entirety shortly after,\nwith little more fuss.\nThe meeting Jacked an experienced Chair, although the\nChairman for the greater part\nof the meeting should be congratulated for his handling of\nthe proceedings, considering\nthat it was his first experience in\nChairing a major meeting. McCullough showed that he was\nnot a good chairman and moreover he showed that he was\nprepared to go to considerable\ndegrees of obstruction to get\nhis own way when debating a motion.\nWhat can be learnt? Council\nstanding orders are totally unwieldy and may require extensive alteration. Council is net\nsufficiently flexible and relies too\nheavily on procedure and pre-ce dent. Council is motivated too\ngreatly by personal opinion and,\ndare I say it, personal gain, at\nthe expense of ICU as a whole.\nMaybe, however, my last comment was too uncharitable, but\nCouncil members of the present\nand future would do well to\nbear this in mind to avoid this\naccusation being made with\ncomplete justification sometime\nhence.\nNo one came out of this\nmeeting with anything approaching clean hands, except perhaps Dave Hobman's kitten who\nwas too young to know any\nbetter. But there again Zee\nmust have had some thoughts\non the matter, as he expressed\nthem with clarity, dignity, and\nproliferation dead in the centre\nof the floor.\nYours, etc.,\nDISILLUSIONED.\ni Dave Sugden edited this issue of FELIX, newspaper of Imperial ji College Union, with able assistance from Mary Short, Colette \u2022\ni Robertson and Dave Gribble.

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX Thursday, 27th January, 1972\nAMERICA America's first ever gig\nwas, I believe at I.C. about\n18 months ago, for which\nthey were paid \u00a325.\nTheir price is now \u00a3750, a testimony indeed to a rapid rise to a fame based on music\nwhich is and let's be honest\nfrank, cruel and boring,\nthat of Crosby, Stills, Nash\nnothing very different from\nand Young or many other\nacoustic - guitar based\ngroups. Having become\nUnderground favourites\nthrough being adopted by\nUnderground Cult Figure\nJeff Dexter and frequently\nplaying Implosion they released a fairly successful\nalbum followed by a very\nsuccessful single whose\ntune is predictable and\nwhose lyrics are, shall we\nsay, nice-but-unimportant.\nBut, as I said, America\nare now a very successful\ngroup and promoters who\n(like your own Entertainments Committee, readers)\nwere foresight ed enough to\nbook them when their price\nwas a good* deal less than\nit is now are very successful too. The Great Hall\nwas bursting at the seams\nfor the concert and some\npeople still had to be turned\naway. The musical evening\nwas opened by Philip\nGoodhand-Tait whose set\nwas well, if not ecstatically\nreceived by a very receptive and sympathetic audi-en ce. Although to many\npeople he may be just a double - barrelled name\nwhom Ents book quite of-ten, he is a successful\nsongwriter, having written\n\"One Road\" for the Love\nAffair, \"The song that\nbrings out peoples pre ju dices\" as he put it. His\nset included, among other\nself-penned numbers.\nBuddy Holly's \"Every Day\"\nand I enjoyed it a lot more\nthan his attempt at the Lyceum last term with Wishbone Ash. This may have\nbeen because your reviewer was able to secure a real\ncomfortable seat instead of\nhaving to squat on the floor.\nIt was interesting to note\nthat the most popular numbers of both GoodhandTait's and Linda Lewis' act\nwere 12-bar blues se que n ces. C 'est la vie. Miss\nmmm Lewis, the coloured folk\nsinger from d ahn the East\nEnd sang a selection of\nsongs about certain men\nand certain parts of London; the songs were inter-e sting, and again, and\nagain she was well re-ce i ved. All the artists must\nhave sensed the \"good\nvibes, man\" in the air and\ntalked to the crowd to long\nlost brothers. America took\nthe stage to thunderous applause normally reserved\nfor heavy groups after a wait which at an outdoor\nfestival would have been\ntermed\" agonizing\" However it was pretty warm in\nthe Great Hall. They ran\nthrough their usual rep ter to ire of songs whose titles\nfor the most part elude me,\nbut which did include\n\"Horse with No Name,\"\n\"California\" and \"The\nSandman\" a great song\nwith an original melody and\nwith lyrics which carry a sense of foreboding. Perhaps it's this song people\nare buying the single for,\nbut somehow I doubt it.\nThe only other song whose\nlyrics grabbed one was\nArlo Guthries \"Coming into\nLos Angeles.\" Anyway the\naudience enjoyed it and\nwho am l to criticise what\npeople enjoy. I think I 'll\nresign. \"Lots of significant\npoints at this concert folks\nand another one was the\nbehaviour of the audience.\nThey remained transfixed\nwith attention throughout\nthe act and there was not\none out-freak er( or freak er out) even during the en-core, so the group must\nhave been good and I'm wrong. Goodnight.\n\u2022Hi m.,,...^^^^^^^^^^^^^ii iii iii Stone Crows I should like everybody\nto know about a group\ncalled Man. Not a new\ngroup by any means, in fact\ntheir fourth album has just\nbeen released, but a group\nthat is only just beginning\nto get recognition in this\ncountry. On the continent\nthey are a top band so I doubt the fact that they go\nout for 50 quid a night worries them unduly. But\nthings are, as I said, looking up, and they must have\nbeen delighted with their\nreception in the Great Hall\non Saturday. The line-up\n(two guitars, drums, bass)\nis nothing to raise the eye-brows, but the standard of\nplaying, and the empathy\nwhich exists between the\nplayers and the subtle use\nof dynamics prompt me to\nstick my neck out and say\nthat in a years time they\nwill be as big as Yes. The\ngroup played three num-be rs, including their best-known (a relative term)\nsong \"Daughter of the\nFireplace,\" all of them very\nlong, but the shifts of texture ensured that they never\nbecame boring. All this,\ntoo, without organist Clive\nJohn who has just left.\nWhen he is replaced and\nthe full scope of the band\nis realised Man will be\nwowing audiences up and\ndown the country.\nI thought I had better say\nthis (I did mean it) so that\nMan were not completely\novershadowed by Stone the\nCrows who were easily the\nbest group to have played\nat I.C. this year (academic\nyear you fool). And to\nthink I thought they were\njust a rock band with a chick singer. They played\nmusic ranging from that\nlike Soft Machine in \"the\ngood old days\" (keyboard\nplayer Ronnie Leahy's influence I think) to down-home country blues and\nsounded as if they had\nbeen playing them all for\nyears (probably have). For\nme the highlight of the\nevening was the keyboards\nsolo; guitarist Les Harvey's solo was just a bit boring\u2014\nhe seems to have just discovered echo and demonstrated it at length, wow far\nout man but hasn't it all\nbeen done before? But I dont want to get too critical and no doubt the audience loved it. To the disappointment j of many Maggie\nBell didn't bust the only\nbutton on her jacket, but\nof course it was music that\nmattered and Crows delivered the goods. It was a measure of their popularity\nthat songs like \" Big Jim\nSalter\" and \"Mister Wizard\" were enthusiastically\napplauded when intro-duce d. Last term I said that\nStone the Crows were going places. It seems they\nhave arrived.\nThe C.W. Post choir, pictured above, gave a concert in the Great Hall last week.\nWhilst the choir gave a first class performance they must surely have been insulted\nby the pathetic turn out. In fact a mere forty people turned up, included in which we\nhave the entire rag committee and the tea makers. Twenty people were needed to pay\nto break even. They didn't. "

At this stage IC were\nmuch quicker and more\ndecisive than Thames,\nthey had practically taken\nover complete control of\nthe midfield and were continually press u rising the\nThames defence.\nAll this pressure deserved a goal which duly\ncame from a corner taken\nby John Kelly, who found\nMick Pearson's head; the\nheader was parried but\nPearson made no mistake\nfrom the rebound. After\nthis goal I.C. maintained\nthe pressure; a precision\npass from John Kelly put\nBill Milne clear of a static\nThames defence and\nMilne added the second\nwith only the goal-keeper\nto beat. These goals seemed to give I.C. the confidence they really needed;\nthey began to move the\nball very effectively and\nonly some very near misses from Pete Bartlett and\nByron Smith kept the goal\ntally down. I.C. mounted\nattack after attack and\nvery rarely was Mick Whitham, the I.C. goal-keeper,\nbrought into the game. It\nwas from one of these attacks that a Thames defender was forced to\nhandle the ball and Noel\nFryer made no mistake\nfrom the spot to make the\nscore 3\u20140 at half time.\nThe second half saw\nI.C. rather complacent\nand their play rather spas-modi c. This allowed\nThames to come more into the game, but I.C. still\nseemed to keep them well\nunder control and they added two more goals\nthrough Bill Milne and Ian\nRodgers before Thames\nsnatched a consolation\ngoal.\nHowever, even with this\nconvincing result I.C.I. will certainly not have any\nsympathy for Thames\nwhen they meet in the 2nd round of the U.L. Cup on\nSaturday, 22nd January\nand hopefully, at least,\nthere will be no complacency. Team:\u2014 M. Whitman,\nM. McGrath, A. Baker, G. Willcock (capt), M. Pearson, N. Fryer, B. Smith, P. Bartlett, B. Milne, J. Kelly,\nI. Rodgers.\nSuccessful Badminton\nTour\nA series of mini-tours\nwas arranged last term for\nmainly the 1st and 2nd teams.\nThe first of these involved 11 people consisting\nof seven 1st team men and\nfour ladies.\nOn Friday 14th January\nsuch names as:\u2014\nHilary Rowson (Ladies\nCapt.)\nSue Thompson\nBrenda Dilley\nJanet Roberts\nG. Georgiou (Mens Capt.)\nS. Donald\n'Souki'\nD. Ward\nR. Palmer\nC. Gaukvoger\nD. Thomas\nset off for the long trek up\nnorth, fully equipped with\nbadminton gear, supplies,\noranges, oranges . . . or-an ges. Our destination\nwas Leeds where we were\nto play Leeds University\non Saturday afternoon. We\nplayed a 'county' style\nmatch which we unfortunately lost 1\u20146; nevertheless a lot has to be said\nabout the team Leeds turned out and how close\nsome of the games were.\nFielding 5 B.U.S. F. representatives out of their\nteam of 8 we did extremely well to contain them at\n11\u20146.\nThe 1st event was the\nMens singles, which involved S. Donald, G. Georgiou, D. Ward. Donald played No. 1 against\nP. Bullivant, who was\nB.U.S. F. champion (sin-g les)69 \u201470. Donald lost\ntwo straight sets, but defiantly gave Bullivant a tough time. Fitness was\nwhat Donald lacked and\nnot ability. Georgiou was\nagainst their Wo. 2 (No. 3\nin disguise), whilst Ward\nlost narrowly 13\u201418, 18\u2014\n14, 12\u201415.\nThe ladies, un fortuna t ely, lost both their singles\nto make I.C.4 \u20141 down.\nIn the mens doubles\nthere was a great fight\nback when I.C. won 3 out\nof 4 games, but the ladies\nagain fell. The final score\nof 11\u20146 against included\nwins by the mixed doubles\nwhere special mention\nmust be made about Miss\nRowson who kept her cool\nwhilst facing Bullivant.\nOn Sunday morning we\nset off to Bradford and\nfielded the rest of the\nteam who were unable to\ntake part at Leeds. I.C. won 9\u20146.\nIn the mens singles, I.C. lost both. Chris Gaukvoger's inexperience being\nresponsible for his losing\nto a B.U.S. F. player. Miss\nThompson beat a large\ngirl (handicapped by her\nweight) and the teams\nshared the mens doubles.\nThe ladies saved the day\nby taking 3 out of the 4\ngames whilst I.C. cruised\nout winners overall after\nthe mixed doubles.\nOn the whole this was a successful tour, indicating\nthe standard of badminton\nat I.C. Rugby\nOn the first Wednesday\nof the term I. C.1st XV\nplayed City University\n(again) at Colliers Wood\nand came away victorious\nby 29 points to 0. Although\nCity 1st XV were below\nstrength, it was an excellent performance by I.C. and augurs well for the\nmany (we hope) cup matches this term.\nCity University won the\ntoss and elected to play\nwith a stiff breeze and the\nsun on their backs. This\nhowever was to no avail\nas I.C. was immediately on\nthe attack. Several handling movements by the I.C. backs worried the City defence while the pack was\nalways prominent with\ntheir constant backing up.\nThe first try came after\nChris Flanagan had made\na penetrating run only to\nbe stopped 5 yards short.\nFrom the resulting scrum\nAndy Tebbett robbed the\nopposing scrum half to\ntouch down close to the\nposts. James converted.\nOther scores came in\nthe first half when John\nMcDonough scored wide\nout and James kicked a penalty to bring the half\ntime score to 13\u20140.\nI.C. turned around and\nwere again immediately on\nthe attack. Bill Baines\nscored under the posts, as\ndid Roy (I 've got more\ntries than you James)\nMatthews. James converted both. The final score\ncame after a handling\nmovement amongst the\nforwards (in which even\nthat celebrated prop\n(eh?) C.M. Wrigley took\npart) resulting in Ozi\ntouching down in the cor-ner. After this the game\ntended to stagnate and\nthe final score was 29\u20140.\nTeam:\u2014 J. Hughes, J. McDonough, B. Baines, P. Pilkington, J. Hunt, A. James (capt.), C. Flanagan, C. Wrigley, H.

The match was the\nfirst the team has played\nin the newly formed London League, the visiting\nteam being from the National Westminster Bank.\nThey tried to gain psychological advantage by appearing in a uniform of\nsuit and tie, but I.C. countered with a display of incredible d is organisation which evidently disturbed\ntheir cool. The home\nteam's policy of multiple\nsubstitution brought accusations of cheating, completely unfounded, but did\ncause great confusion on\nthe score card. The result\nwas agreed upon as the\nbest of the possibilities,\nbut it was I.C.'s game all\nthe way, especially after\nthe second round, which\nwe won 18-3, and after the\nopposition's10 th round\nfrom Southside Bar. One\nmember of the Bank team\nwas seen to be seriously\nput off a vital shot by the\nmention of the word 'beer'\nby a colleague, and thus\nsome credit for our victory must go to them.

Between the time of writing and publishing, the Rugby,\nFootball and Ladies Hockey Clubs should have played\nin their second round matches against tough opp osi tion, and we hope to see all three Clubs in the third\nround (semi finals!).\nBecause Mrs. Thatcher has managed to deflate the\nsituation with respect to Student Union Finance, it does\nnot mean that Sports Clubs and their members should\nforget about the whole issue \u2014 she may try a new\nploy. We must continue analysing the latest in fanatic i which is to be found in the newspapers and from l. c.U. In the middle of February A.C.C. would like to know\nwhat exotic places (within the London boundary!)\nClubs are thinking of visiting, and what sort of support\na tour would receive from within the club. The reputation of tours of being drinking orgies (not sub sidi sed) is quite true! But the honour of the club is at stake\nand captains have ambitions about winning the odd\nmatch. Meanwhile, it is a great opportunity for people\nof perhaps lesser ability to play alongside better players\nand hence learn more about their particular game.\nCongratulations must be levelled at the Swimming\nClub Committee for taking the initiative and organising\na major International Water Polo tournament in the I.C. pool.

A classy 140 strong field\nstarted the gruelling 7\\\nmile race over heavy\nplough and deep mud with\noccasional ditches and\nstiles. A promising start\nby Ed Wiliams ended in\ninjury, but Rob Parker,\nreaping the benefits of his\nheavy Christmas training\nprogramme, had a fine run\nin 24th place. The main\npack was led by Matthew\nSmyth (56th) running better than ever, with Ed Williams (57th) after coming\nthrough from the back. An\nunfit Rog Phelps was 60th with Pete Lewis (68th) running very well. Paul\nClarke ran steadily in 69th place and Rich Wilson was\n63rd. Dave Jones (107th) completed the scoring\neight with Rob Maddison\nrunning as an individual,\n112th. The race was won in\n40.52 by Chris Garforth\n(Cambridge) with Doug\nGunstone (Cambridge, ex\nLSE), third. The first London runner was Bob\nReeves (Q.M. C.) in 9th. Rob Parker was the second London runner.\nThe team result was, 1st Cambridge, 2nd Leeds,\n3rd Oxford, 6th Imperial\nCollege. 22 teams were en-te red.
