    "content": "EDITORIAL.\nTHE NEED FOR A LARGER HOSTEL.\nA good deal has already been said in past issues of\nPHOENIX deploring the\"10 till5\" attitude of a large number\nof our students; odd creatures who attend College during the specified hours to soak up science and technology, and then\ndash home to soak up more science until they go to bed; people\nwho take no part in any College activity, get to know only those\nwith whom they work, and leave College with minds narrowed to the single track of their own particular subject. Although the College as a whole loses by the lack of\nspirit of these people, they themselves are obviously the greatest losers. We have such a wide range of social and athletic clubs that it is Inconceivable that each student cannot find atleast one\nin which he would be interested. The facilities are there, and\nit may be argued that if people are content with a mere technical school education then that is their own affair. This is a shortsighted view with which few would agree,\nbut what can be done? Dinner in Hall is a new step in the right direction, and club secretaries can do much by vigorous action at\nthe beginning of the year and by extensive advertising. However\nthese are merely palliatives; the only cure is vastly to increase the hostel accommodation. The more nearly we can become a fully residential College, the more nearly will our students obtain a full University education. Covetous eyes may be cast in vain at the large blocks of flats in our neighbourhood, but presumably the possibility of\nobtaining some of these has already been fully explored. We know\nthat alterations to the Union buildings are under consideration, but nothing has yet been said about providing greater hostel accommodation. If alternative laboratories could be built for the\nBotany and Zoology departments and their present two buildings converted to hostels, this would form a. much greater contribution to college life than the addition of new refectories and committee\nrooms.\nBRISTOL'S ENGINEERS.\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that the Bristol students\npublication, Nonsuch News, has circulated a question aire to find cut how undergraduates spend their leisure. From the answers It concludes that\" after working, eating, sleeping and being culturally active\" the undergraduate has seven hours a week left.\" First year students of all categories spend more of\ntheir spare time drinking coffee than anything else. In the second\nyear da no. ing and the opposite sex take first place. But third year\nstudents drop all that sort of nonsense and go back to coffee in a really big way - they spend almost as much time on it as on all their other leisure pursuits put together\". So far, so good.\nNonsuch News then concludes that medical students are the heaviest drinkers, and engineers the lightest. We most vigorously protest against this as being the most\nblatant nonsense, and a grave libel against an honoured profession. Engineers are renowned the world over for their ability to sink the manly pint with frequency and with relish, and it is at College that this ability is developed. We can only conclude that the question aire was either based on a complete fallacy, or that it was compiled by a medical student. "

Dear Sir, We view with concern your decision to take \" Felix\", airing him out like a barmaid's a or on, and deliver him dry and tasteless into our eager grasp every other Friday. Fie on you, sir. Can it be that you have turned an\nappreciative ear to the fiendish banshee wailing s of those\nsensitive beings, who turn pale and tremble at the very sight of\nthe word BEER, even though it appears in the pages of the most\nrespected addition to modern journalism? Take a firm stand our worthy friend. Let those who wish devour glasses of milk and back numbers of \"Phoenix\", but please provide us with a pleasantly damp periodical, the thirst provoking pages of which will emit the delicate perfume of hops, and tend\nto increase our already astronomical capacity by leaps and bounds.\nBacchus in his bottle lined grave, and the drinking men\nof I.C. are right behind you, and are prepared to fight to the\nlast drop of your blood. Yours faithfully, Mild& Bitter. Imperial College Union,10 th February,1950. The Editor,\" Felix\". Dear Sir, Many members of College v/ ho use the Refectory seem unaware\nof the fact that there is a sub-committee of the Refectory Committee\nthe Catering Sub-Committee - set up for the purpose of receiving comments and suggestions on all matters concerning the Refectory. As chairman of that sub-committee, the other members of\nwhich are Dr. C.A. Pratt and the F resident of the I.C. Union, I should like to take advantage of your periodical to make known as\nwidely as possible that we are anxious to do all we can to improve\nthe existing facilities. All suggestions to this end will be most\nwelcome .\nA Suggestions Box is being procured and will be placed in the Union. It is intended to clear this once a week, on Wednesday\nevenings. Until this is in operation all suggestions should be\naddressed to me, c/o Botany Dept.\nYours sincerely, J. F. Levy.\nTo the Editor of \" Felix\".51, Woodland Drive, Watford. Sir, None of us likes to hear I.C. described as a\" Technical College\", yet our rigorous limitation of our studies to scientific subjects, worse, our company to scientists, cultivates just the\natmosphere and mentality to invite such criticism. This state of\naffairs, while no doubt unnoticeable mostly by reason of its familiarity, becomes very obvious to those of us who have studied at, or even visited, universities and colleges in which the various faculties have opportunities of getting together and comparing notes.

    "content": "TELEVISION FROM I.C. On Wednesday night,8 th February, the B.3.0. televised from our Union gym a demonstration of Judo by the Budokwai, the\noldest Judo club In this country. Elaborate preparations had\nbeen going on for some days, and Reg Gill was seen to turn green\nwith envy at the sight of the engineers( real ones) fitting up\nmasses of arc lamps and gadgets that made our own arrangements\nlook like Christmas tree candles. Much to everyone's surprise and Reg's secret disappointment everything worked, and the show duly went on the\nair at 8.30. Those few who were fortunate enough to get in, with or without passes, saw a most impressive display of the so called gentle art, which looked far from gentle particularly a demonstration by a charming young lady of how to deal with a would-be bag snatch er( It should be mentioned that she was carrying a handbag).\nThe programme must have been quite impressive, for one\nviewer was so fired with enthusiasm that he promptly rang up the\nUnion to ask how he could join the club'. Perhaps he, too, has\ndifficulties with the police. E.M. H.S. S. CARNIVAL,R.C.S. On being asked to give my impressions of the carnival, I can say without fear of contradiction, that, were it included in\"1066 and all that\", It would have undoubtedly come under the category of \"good things\". Everyone appeared to enjoy themselves, I was in such a state that I even thought Len Smith's jokes were\nfunny, and between ourselves I think I must have had a touch of\nI.T's during the cabaret( a first class one, incidentally), because\nI'm sure I saw a skeleton on the stage. I was sobered up by a visit from Geoff. Millard' s wild kippers, and during my brief sober\nperiod I remember taking along look at the undeniably beautiful legs of a popular I. C.W. A. member.\nWhat happened to the raffle, no one seems to know, but\ndon't be surprised if the organisers announce their intention of\nspending Easter in the South of France. Finally, a word of thanks to all who helped In the production of the Carnival, and to Reg. Gill for the music after the band had left not forgetting the tactful person who turned the\nlight off in the lounge-;\n\" Jolly Jack\". "

    "content": "- 4 -for the privilege of the first flight. He won!\" Then came the war.\nEnlisting as a private and commissioned three months later he\ntransferred to the Royal Flying Corps on its formation in1916. Distinguished service in France led to the offer of a permanent\ncareer in the R.A.F.(\"I had intended to return to my sketching and paints\"). His energies were guided into engineering channels\nin1917 when he directed experimental flying at Far n ho rough. A bewildering succession of appointments in the next thirty years\ntestify to his abilities as airman and engineer a like. This wide\nexperience proved to be of inestimable value during the late war,\nin appointments ranging from Director of Technical Development to Chief of Fighter Command. Even then he found time to chase flying bombs on his own account.\nAs Rector, Sir Rod eric regards himself as \"a sort of\nsenior student\". Coming back to the academic world after nearly forty years he admits that he is still learning,. his ideas still forming. But it is evident that he bring stoI.C. a freshness of\noutlook not always found In university life. He believes that the\nstudy of the sciences is not only of great practical value but Is\nan intellectual discipline in itself and a contribution to a liberal outlook. The individual he regards as all Important and tries to get to know personally as many students as possible. He feels that students should try to have the widest interests outside their study and regards it as part of his job to\ngive help and encouragement wherever possible. Only by taking part in college activities can students hope to get the most out of\ntheir university days. In this connection he deplores the shortage\nof college rooms; he would like to see accommodation for at least four hundred more students, s'o that a greater number might\nappreciate the value of collegiate life. College affairs occupy most of his time but he still finds a few spare moments for painting and sketching. Recently( \"for fun\") he illustrated a book written by his elder daughter.\nAnother occasional recreation is gliding. Motoring through the\nback streets of Tooting on his way to the airfield last November\nhe found himself facing the wrong way in a one way street.\" A policeman appeared from nowhere. He was. not at all impressed by\nmy soft talk\", commented Sir Rod eric. \"Though only technically In the wrong one must accept the laws as they stand and pay up!\"\nThis philosophical attitude has, perhaps, some wisdom for those of\nus who remember the 5 th of November.\nWe at I.C. have been increasingly aware during the last eighteen months of a new spirit pervading College affairs. It is fair to say that this is. due in no small measure to our Rector, Sir Rod eric Hill. M.M.& C.M. H. If there is any credit attaching to what he does, he\nwould like half to go to Lady Hill the better half!

A gold tooth, broken loose from its moorings in a recent rug ger match had been\nplaced for safety on the edge of his plate hence the panic when\nthe plate was whipped away while he was fetching his sweet. Don't rush off and start panning - he recovered it from the pig food and\nreplaced it( ugh!)\nTo avoid repetition of this sordid scene will people with fal sies please put them in the small glasses provided and not on\nthe plate.

    "content": "LETTER PROM AMERICA.\nWe publish here part of a letter received by Nick Sadler from prank Leighton, who left City and Guilds last year. After describing his trip out to Seattle by sea and air, and the difficulties of an alien in finding aoi vil engineering job in N.W. America, Prank continues: Then I had a lucky break, and got in touch with a man #\nnear here who owns and operates a44 foot fishing schooner. I went\ninto partnership with him on a percentage basis, and have been\nfishing for the past two months, until the season ended a week ago.\nThey were two of the best months I can remember - it was\nhard work, but I enjoyed being afloat again, and I have seen more\ncountry than I had ever hoped. In those two months I have fished salmon off Alaska, and chased tuna fish down the Pacific to Mexico. We sailed out of the Strait of Juan, de Fuca on 1st September\nand headed North for salmon. Then we heard that the tuna were coming\nin off the Cali for nl an coa3t, and set her head South. For four days\nand nights we sailed South, keeping3 hour watches between us, out\ninto the warm blue waters of the Japanese Current where the tuna fish run. about 100 miles offshore, until we got onto the fish off the N. Californian coast. In the first few days haul we put 6 tons of fish on board, all pulled in by hand in15to40 lb dollops'. In the really heavy\nfishing it was nothing to see all9 lines loaded at once. Oh boy!\nWhat excitement! On the best day we were up at 4.30 a.m. and had\npulled1\"! tons of fish on board by -the time we had breakfast at\n11.30 a.m. That was really the first and last fish of the tuna season.\nFor the next 5 or 6 weeks we spent our time fighting the weather-continual gales and near gales' from the North West.\nStill trying to' fish at every' opportunity, we were\nsteadily blown down the line, as we could only run before it when it got really bad. We put in at San Francisco( through the Golden Gate), Monterey and San Pedro as we were driven South with each gale. Then\nwe decided we should have to head back North, or we should be unable to make it before the winter weather set in. So back we came,\nliterally clawing our way up the coast, bucking' North Westers all the way. And how', safely back after\" bucking\" our way up nearly1000 miles of Pacific Coast, I feel I can at last almost call myself a sailor. At least I know what it is to crawl into harbour with the\ndecks swept clear of every movable item( despite lashing), and an\n11\" diameter mast snapped off like a matchstick! Having been back a week, I have spent 2 days in the\nmountains hunting deer until the season closed today, and I am now\ngoing to start job hunting again. Failing a civil engineering job\nhere I am going to buy myself a car( with trie proceeds of the fishing trip) and. take along trip up to Canada- either to have a holiday or\nto get a job there if I can. If I don't get a joh there or down here, Is hall start heading for home again. We hope to publish extracts from two further letters from Frank in our next issue. PROFILE: THE RECTOR.\nThe world of art, of science and of action are not mutually exclusive but are rarely all found in a single person. We are\ntherefore fortunate to find all three personified in Air Chief Marshal^ ir Rod eric Hill, Rector of Imperial College since1948. Nursed in academic surroundings, the son of a professor of\nmathematics, his earliest interests were in art.

    "content": "FUTURE OF I.C. HOSTEL.\nTROUBLE IN THE HOME.\nLast term the hostel committee, elected from the hostel residents, found themselves confronting a mass meeting of their electorate who d.emanded to know why they had proposed a new ruling limiting residents to a maximum of two years in the hostel. Actually the ruling was not new; what was new was the decision of the committee to enforce it. Arguments came from both sides; the more altruistic and\nhigh minded( or perhaps they were leaving this year anyway!) spoke\nfor the enforcement on the lines' of fair shares for the maximum\nnumber. Their opponents - and they were in the' majority took the\nline that the hostel housed most of those who worked hardest for Union affairs, and these people should be encouraged by being allowed to live in the hostel. In a hostel accommodating 100, they\nsaid, where student officers of the College Unions were, ip so facto, offered rooms, the in take of new students under the Two Year rule would be negligible a \"drop in the ocean as Mr. Coomber styled it. After many speakers had argued along these lines the\ncommittee resigned as a body and were promptly reelected, but\nwith a warning no Two Year rule. THE GENTLE VETO.\nThis, briefly, was the situation until three weeks ago\nwhen the Rector took a hand and administered what was probably the most diplomatic Veto since that word crept into common use.\n&t an informal meeting with the residents, with John\nLevy in the Chair, the Rector outlined the history of the hostel administration, and expressed his appreciation of the sensible way students had conducted their affairs since1945. In that year the hostel was placed on its present democratic basis, the former\nrigid disciplinary code being replaced by the more adult conception of self restrain t.h Inevitably, the Rector pointed out, there arises under\nthis democratic type of control the odd question on which there is a division of opinion in this case the Two Year rule and on an\nissue of such importance he felt that the responsibility for a decision which affected the whole future of the hostel should be\nshouldered by an unprejudiced observer who had the welfare of the\nhostel at heart.' i 'he Rector fully appreciated the arguments from both sides, but his own opinion and decision was that the Two Year\nrule,- although but a drop in the ocean, was nevertheless a timely drop in the right ocean.\nDiscussion following this not unexpected, announcement\nshowed that most people were impressed by the Rector's careful reasoning and. accepted the limit in principle with, one or two\nminor modifications. After man;/ people had e leaded, and received assurance, that the exceptional case would receive sympathetic consideration for a third year, other points were discussed. Derek K orr is suggested that Freshmen be ineligible for the hostel in their first year. This, he felt, would be fairer as\nthe selectors would than know something about them, and they them-selves if admitted would not have to leave the hostel at the beginning\nof their third year. This met with much approval, and the committee\nhaving promised to consider it the meeting turned to less serious matters..

Dinner\nThur. 2 Combined Clubs Dinner\nPri.36.30 Chem. Soc. Annual Dinner\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR.\nI.C. Union.\n3rd February 1950.\nThe Editor of Felix. Dear Sir, As chief executive of the Union, I must protest at your\neditorial on the question of the November the fifth fines. It is laid down in the Union Bye Laws that the executive\ncommittee shall concern itself with domes tio matters and matters\nof urgency only. The sum oo lle c ted by subscription up till January the twenty third was only sufficient to cover legal expenses incurred. The question of whether fines should be paid\nout of Union funds was therefore one that should be referred to Council, for their decision or for their reference to a Union\nGeneral Meeting should they consider this necessary.\nThere is considerable weight in favour of the argument\nthat the fines should be paid in part or in full by those who\nwere foolish enough to be caught, and who should therefore pay\nmore than those who steered clear of the police. Since further subscriptions have now come in, it seems\nlikely that this amount, together with the profit from increasing\nthe price of our Saturday night 'hop', will be enough to cover\nthe fines as well as the other expenses. Had this not been so,\nhowever, your misguided and ill timed editorial would still have\nmisled the members of the Union. As 1 have stated above the question\nwas still 'sub jud ice', and had been referred to the appropriate\nauthority.\nFelix can play a big part in building up the spirit of\nunity in the Union. It will not do this, however, by stirring up\ndissent ion between the members of the Union and their elected\nofficers. Your article may well have given the impression that\ncertain members of the Union are being harshly treated by a set\nof tyrannical Union officers. In wishing Felix every success in the future, I am,\nsir, your obedient servant,\nPAUL CUMMING.\nPresident, Imperial College Union.\nWe fail to s ee how our Editorial could *\u00b0 described as\nmisguided or misleading, since the facts It stated are confirmed by\nMr. Cumming's letter. We certainly had no intention of stirring up dissent ion, and\nwe cannot believe that our readers construed the article in this\nway.\nEditor. Obituary.\nWe regret to announce the death of the Rev. Canon J.0. Hannay,M.AL it t.D., Vicar of Holy Trinity, Prince Consort Road, since 1934.\nCanon Hannay, well known to the reading public as George A. Birmingham, was a good friend and neighbour of Imperial College. He\ndelivered the 1947 Commemoration Day address and in1948 was elected\nan Honorary Fellow of Imperial College. "
