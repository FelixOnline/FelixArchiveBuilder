    "content": "Letters Inter-Hall\nRag\nDear Pallab\nAs a person who has been\nactively involved in the Guilds\nUnion since my first week at\nImperial onwards, I feel that I must try to offer some explanation to the rather unrepresentative article 'CCUs Slated'\nin last week's FELIX. The CC Us are in my opinion\nthe best social groups in College\nand without the enthusiasm of\nthe C CU hacks IC Rag would\nbe a lot worse off, if in existence\nat all.\nNeedless to say the quote of\n'ineffective organisations' was\nnot referring to the CCUs on\nthe whole. Unfortunately very\nfew people identify themselves\nwith their C CU enough to turn\nout on collections to ensure that\nthe C CU of which they are a member has the highest Rag\ntotal. The statement was referring to this, and arose when I was suggesting that we should\nencourage competition between\nadditional units such as Halls\nand Houses on our next collection licence.\nYours\nJames Benbow\nIC Rag Chairman\nBig John\nScott\nDear Sir\nIt seems appropriate enough\nthat our very own IC 'Big\nBrother' should choose this\nparticular time to reveal him-self. I am of course referring to\nthe ranting s of FELIX Sports\nPage Editor John Scott in last\nweek's issue. In case you didn't notice, the esteemed badminton\nsuperstar has decreed that any\nfuture sports reports not corn-forming to his four-point recipe\nfor compositional nirvana will\nbe discarded. Although Mr Scott's own lengthy articles for\nthe Badminton Club achieve\nwidespread admiration I'm sure\nthere are many other contributors who feel patronised, as I do, by his suggestion that we\nread the Daily Mirror (!) to see\nhow sports reports should\nreally be written.\nJoking aside it must be said\nthat John is only trying to do his\njob in attempting to achieve\nwider readership for individual\nclubs' articles. The road to this\nend however surely lies in\ntell tY S lo-im sailor \u00ab\nfp8 a \u2014 > c Letters to the Editor are always welcome on any subject at all. They should be submitted to the FELIX Office before Monday1:00 pm for inclusion in Friday's FELIX. Page 21\npositively encouraging clubs to\nsubmit more creative and interesting pieces rather than constraining them to the form\nproposed which we can. it' we\nwish, read in the Torygraph.\nGrauniad or indeed the Daily\nMorass every day.\nAdmittedly few people want\nto be presented every week with\nself-indulgent garbage full of in-jokes and macho beer-swilling\nstories. Even so it should be\npossible for FELIX to produce\na readable Sports Page without\nrecourse to this kind of dictatorial circumscription.\nYours faithfully\nChris Gordon\nCaptain ICAFC 3rd XI\nTyping Err ers Dear Pallab\nI was shocked by the revelation in Ken Weale's letter last\nweek that you had been sent on\na typing course at a cost to the\nUnion of \u00a396. Having seen your\npitiful attempts at typing I have\ngrave doubts that this was\nmoney well spent. Either the\ncourse was extremely poor or\nyou were not paying attention\nin class. I think we should\ndemand our money back.\nYours etc\nJ Martin Taylor\nLoony\nLefties\nDear Pallab\nIn reply to Jonathan\nGerson's letter in the Christmas\nedition of FELIX, I feel I must\nset the record straight concerning myself, the Liberal\nClub and the loony lefties.\nAs was pointed out by Mr Gerson, I wrote a letter to\nIIIIIPMIIIIlllHIll\u2014I Friday, 20\nPrivate Eye about a visit by Mr Michael Meadowcroft, a Liberal MP. to IC. saying what\nan em baras singh sma ii audience he had. This may seem a rather below the belt thing to\ndo. but Mr Meadowcroft, instead of speaking on what he'd supposedly come to IC to talk\nabout, waffled on for three\nquarters of an hour about\nhimself, his constituency, and\nHIS political views\u2014in short he\nblew his own trumpet, an act\nusually associated with MPs in\nthe present conservative admin-is t ration. Concerning the loony let ties, well it is totally inexpedient to\nclass people such as myself as\nbeing in this category (as was\nimplied by Mr Gerson). On the\ncontrary; I consider myself to\nbe somewhat conservative in\nmy views and so do various\nSDP friends of mine, but are all\nagree that good old Macmillanite conservatism is one thing,\nwhilst oppressive, intransigent\nThatcherism is another, and\njust because we Liberal/SDPites have the guts to speak out\nagainst our leaders when we\ndisagree with them\nPhilip A Green\nFremantle\nMisery\nDear Editor\nI'm a first year, but I like to\nconsider myself educated in the\nway of the world, and quite\nfrankly, I am disgusted.\nI was led to believe that student\nlife was a happy time. My stay at\nthe now infamous Fremantle\nHotel has been a positive misery.\nThis is mainly due to the lack\nof consideration and gross mismanagement displayed by the\nnewly appointed Warden. Warden indeed!\nFor example, he neglected to\ndo anything about the fact that\nJanuary. 1984 WMRWWBBMHBBM\n| : freezers had broken\nUowii. u u.v \u2022 unnecessarily\ncausing several hundred ;.\u2022 mid\u2022von hi \u00abt*T.> oJ to pen':!.\nTin... a not ner time when a nip. burst in ti is. room above me\nand water cascaded in ton ents\nover my bookcase, ruining a term's notes, noi only was he\ndrunk at the time, he seemed to\ntreat the whole matter as a joke,'\nquo ate 'They're your notes,\nsonny'\nNothing was done until the\nnew sub warden moved in.\nWithin two hours of his\narrival. I had been offered a new\nroom, and the plumber had been\ncalled s in to deal with the leak.\nThese are but two examples of\nM; James' stupidity and ui is u if a bil itv for the i or>.

Once again the\nbaked beans were stone cold.\nIt seems to me inconceivable\nthat w ith the vast resources and\nhuge staff of the refectories it is\nimpossible to prepare correctly\nso simple a dish as baked beans.\nYours sincerely\nDavid Rowe\nChemistry 3\ncc Pallab Ghosh\nDear Mr Rowe\nI was sorry to see by your\nletter of 9 January, addressed to\nCiaynor Lewis. President of IC\nUnion, that the baked beans\nsituation has not improved in\nthe Union Lower Refectory.\nI have today instructed my\ndeputy to install a small electric\nhot plate, solely for the purpose\nof heating baked beans, and\ntrust that this will improve the\nsituation. In the meantime, I would ask you to accept my\napologies for our shortcomings.\nYours sincerely\nVJ Mooney\nRefectory Manager\nI FELIX\n\n"

As I said last week, there is no reason\nwhy articles can't be creative and entertaining\nwhen in a set format. The idea is to prevent the\nworst excesses of 'in' jokes and accounts of\npiss-ups which just about every article writer,\nincluding myself, have resorted to in the past.\nIt is rather arrogant of Chris to assume that\nhe can write excellent sports reports without\nany help, when the tabloid writers go on\nextensive training courses.\nIf anyone is interested in going up to\nHarlington on Wednesday afternoons to take\nphotographs for the sports page would they\nplease contact me via ACC pigeon ole s or the\nFELIX Office.

    "content": "Reviews] by Joseph Caruso\nat Wyndhams Theatre.\nSet in 1890s, 'Little Lies' is a free\nadaptation of Pinero's long-running Victorian\nfarce 'The Magistrate'. Its humour hinges on\nthe deceit that Mrs Posket practised on her\nmarriage to the eminently respectable Mr\nPosket, the magistrate of Pinero s original\ntitle. On the death of her first husband,\nfinding herself of an 'awkward age' for\nremarriage, she took the liberty of docking\nfive years from her age. Unfortunately, she\nhad to do the same for her son Cis, who\nunaware of his true age, prances round the\nstage in a monstrously tight Eton jacket.\nMuch comedy comes from his unnaturally\n(for a boy of 14) precocious tastes in\ngambling, drinking and lusting a tter his young\nmusic teacher. Played with exuberant high\nspirits by Dominic Guard, he is aided by\nLeonard Maguire as. Wyke, the bleary,\ndodder y old butler, who sneaks Cis the best\nport when no-one's looking.\nThe moment Sir John Mills CBE walks on,\nhe gets a large hand from the audience (most\nblue-rinsed pensioners in my Saturday\nmatinee performance). Whether this approbation is due to his knighthood, or whether to\nsheer envy at his audacity at stepping on a stage at 75 years sold, is unclear, but it most\ncertainly occurs before the noble knight gets\na chance to speak. But do not fear!\u2014he gives\na most accomplished performance as Mr\nPosket, a bandy-legged ux or io us old gentle-man, full of affectionate concern for his wild\nstepson.\nThis pre dili c tion, however, leads him into\ntrouble, when the unscrupulous young Cis,\nlures him into a night on the town at the\nrisque Hotel des Princes. Owned by a flamboyant Frenchwoman Mandame Blond,\nthe establishment is raided during the course\nof the evening by Posket's own men.\nMeanwhile, Mrs Posket (a distraught\nConnie Booth) has secretly also gone to the\nhotel, with her sister Charlotte. She has\nlearnt that an old friend of both Poskets,\nColonel Lukyn, has newly-arrived from\nabroad, and aware that he attended Cis's christening, has come to warn him against\nrevealing her 'little lie'. But who should be\nwith Lukyn, but Captain Horace Vale, whose\nheart has been broken by none other than\nCharlotte. Here Malcolm Sinclair, as a kind\nof morose John Clessish character, gives one\nof the funniest performances in the play.\n1 will not reveal any more, but just add that\neveryone's deceptions are finally exposed,\nleaving the characters to live happily (and\none hopes, more honestly) forever.\nClaire Moss\n\u2022 ^ iv imt Mi a*m dtm^ by Christopher Hampton\nat the Oiivic NT.\nWhen the 'emigres' arrived in Southern\nCalifornia during the 1930s. writers, artists\nand poets driven from their German and\nAustrian homeland by the vise of the Third\nReich, they were to find awaiting for them a life rich in material and financial n waif\nStripped of their culture, however, and un\nable to write freely to earn a living wage,\nmany of them felt Hollywood was far from\nparadise, but more a living hell.\nInto this world steps Odon von Horvath, a promising playwright especially re in f^r rial by Howard for the o lay( in reality Hotvath\nwas killed by the falling branch ot a chestnut\ntree, long before he ever reached America).\nHorvath tells of his rise to prosperity, of the\npeople he knew there (amongst them Brecht\nand the Brothers Mann) and the agony they\nsuffered in writing the endlessly d ro'H scenarios demanded of them by their employers (principally MGM and Warner Brothers). Ultimately many of these authors\nwere publicly disgraced by the McCarthy\nmovement, having moved towards socialism\nafter the humiliation and suffering experienced by their fellow men in the hands of the\nNazis.\nIt is a very light hearted, but excellently\nbalanced production. As a black .comedy,\nrich in irony it mimics the glamorous sheen of\nthe 1930s' film industry (and in passing, the\nwave of trashy tech nicol our remakes in the\n70s) whilst still retaining the gravity essential\nto the play's outcome. If the humour tends to\n(Right) Berthold Brecht (Ian McDiamid in\n'Tales From Hollywood'. (Above)\nBarbara Murray and John Mills in 'Little\nLies'.\nStudent-standby tickets are available at\nmost West End theatres an hour before\nthe production, but it is advisable to\ncheck with the box office first.\nglitter rather than sparkle in the introduction,\nbecome:', unnoticeable as the play\ngathers momentum jp~ the characters art\"\no ii owe ci to develop.\nHampton has used Horvath in order u. candidly emphasise some persona! aspects\nol the characters which was hidden in th t 'ir\npublished work. Heinrkh Mann (Philip\nLocke), an outmoded author, is a more\npathetic figure than photographs of him\nsuggest, press uri sed by his wife and severely-criticised by his brother, a mature, middle\naged man basking in his literary success. Ian\nMcDiarmid gives a fine performance as\nBerthold Brecht, warming to his\ncharacter and making full use of the in nova five techniques employed by him and\ncribbed\u2014with kind permission\u2014by\nHampton. In fact the only weak performance\nis that of John Bluthal. whose performance of\nMoney, the millionaire and film tycoon, is\nStiff, clich ed and thankfully short.\nUnfortunately the play's introduction\ngreatly.lacks continuity. The open stage at\nthe Olivier Theatre is a little too large for the\nsets the production encompasses, so that\ncharacters are shunted about on armchairs\nand other pieces of furniture like well paying\nresidents of a Beverley Hills Rest Home. The\n'lighting was effective, though limited. Dimming the sets perhaps w oui d have allowed\nsmoother scene changes and cleared up\nconfusions as to whom the principal was\naddressing, his companions or the audience.\nAt times, neither seemed to know.\nTales From Hollywood runs until early\nFebruary, which is a pity because it was\nreceived little publicity next to Jean Seberg,\nNational Theatre's other major production at\nthe Olivier. I found it both amusing and\ninformative and 1 look forward to future\nproductions from this young author.\nJohn Burgess\nPage 6 Friday, 20 January, 19841 1FELIX "

'Reasonable' travel\ncosts above \u00a350, covering daily\ntravel into College and three\nreturn journeys to your parental\nhome, can at present also be\nreclaimed. (You should check\njust how reasonable your LEA are prepared to be in reimbursing\nthese expenses).\nThe sum paid by your LEA can\nbe less than the full \u00a31,975,\nprincipally because many parents\nare expected to contribute to the\ngrant their children receive. Un less you are 25 or over or have\nbeen supporting yourself on y f fur own earnings for at least three\nyears, your parents income will\nbe assessed to determine this\ncontribution. The student's own\nincome is also assessed and any\nterm time income above \u00a3375 per\nyear is deducted pound for pound\nfrom your grant. Any scholarship\nincome above \u00a3540 (\u00a3795 for\nNational Engineering scholar-ships) again results in pound for\npound deductions from the\ngrant.\nYour LEA may also give you\nan extra maintenance allowance,\nprincipally if you are a mature\nstudent or have dependents or\nspecial needs. Be sure to check\nthat you are receiving your full\nentitlement.\nCovenants for Students\nIf your parents contribute a sum\nto your grant they may be able to\nease the financial burden by\ncovenanting it.\nA covenant is a legally binding\nagreement under which one\nperson promises to make a series\nof payments to another. Making\na covenant of the parental\ncontribution will enable a student\nto claim back the basic rae of tax\nthe parent has already paid on the\ncontribution.\nFor example, normally on\nearnings of \u00a3100 a taxpayer\nwould pay \u00a330 leaving \u00a370. By using a covenant your parents\ngive you the \u00a370 and the taxman\nwill give you the \u00a330 that they\nhave already paid.\nThis arrangement works only\nif:\n1) the parent pays tax and the\nLast week Peter Burt described the gloomy outlook for student grants. Over the next few weeks he will be writing a series of articles on how to make your grant go further. This week's article is about undergraduate grants and covenants, successive articles will cover real grants and covenants, successive articles will cover rent rebates, sup le ment ary benefits and NHS benefits. These articles could save you a lot of money and hassles owe recommend that you keep these articles for future refer-en ce. student does not.\n2) the student is over 18 years\nold or married.\nUse of a covenant means that\nthe student will have to pay tax\non his/her own income once the\npersonal tax allowance, which is\ncurently \u00a31,785, is exceeded. You must therefore make sure that\nyour total income (covenant and\nvacation earnings and taxable\nbenefits and investment income\netc) in a tax year does not exceed\nthis. Grants and most scholarships are not taxable.\nA covenant can be drawn up at\nany time of year or at any point in\nyour co j irs e, but they cannot be\nbackdated. The sooner it is done\nthe more you will benefit.\nvarious with changes in the basic\nrate.\n2. The covenant is then sealed\n\u2022with a red seal.\n3. Date and sign the covenant.\nThis should be witnessed but not\nby the beneficiary and preferably\nnot by a parent. Keep copies for\nthe parent, student and taxman.\n3. The parent pays the net\nYou'll find your grant check just through that door'\nDeed of Covenant\nI, Edward Smith, of 16 Moon Street, Blackburn, covenant to\npay my son, William Smith, of the same address, a gross\namount of \u00a3116.67 on each of the following dates in each year,\nnamely 1 October, 1 January, 1 April, for the period of seven\nyears, or for the period of our joint lives, or until he ceases to be\nreceiving full-time education at any university, college, school\nor other education establishment (whichever is the shortest\nperiod), the first payment to be made on 1 October 1983.\n|Dated 1 September 1983\nSigned, sealed and delivered by Edward Smith\nin the presence of\n(witness' signature and address)\nHow to go about covenanting\n1. Write out a deed of covenant using the above word-ing.\nNote that covenants should be\n| said to run for a period of seven\nyears. The covenant can be\nabandoned before then, but there\n4 must be no prior intention to do\nthis.\nIf you want to change the\namounts of money covenanted,\nthe original deed can be torn up\nand a new one made out, with the\nagreement of the student, in writing.\nIt is advisable to use payment\ndates which fall only in term time,\nBim HH H^r Mg^20 January, 1984\nj as the authorities may otherwise\nI include covenant payments as\n,part of your vacation income if\nyou apply for vacation benefits.\nThe wording used in the\ni example means that if you are to\nreceive a constant overall sum,\nyour parents will have to alter the\namount that they give you every\ntime the basic rate of tax changes,\nas they have agreed to pay a 'gross' amount to you. It is also\npossible to agree to pay 'an\namount, which after deduction of\ntax at the basic rate, amounts to\n\u00a3...'. This means that they pay a constant amount, but the refund\nthe student gets from the taxman\namount on the dates stated on the\ncovenant. The first payment must\nnot be before the date on which\nthe covenant was signed.\n4. The parent gets a copy of form 1R185( AP) from the tax\noffice and completes it. The\ncompleted form is returned to the\nstudent's tax office, or the nearest\nif s/ he does not have one (look in\nthe phone book under 'Inland\nRevenue'). A copy of the\ncovenant should be included with\nthe first claim.\n5. The student then completes\nclaim form \" R40 and, if the\ntaxman is satisfied, will be\nreimbursed at the end of the tax\nyear.\nCovenants can also be draw rt up between, say, you and your\ngraduates or brothers, sisters etc.\nIn such cases the recipient does\nnot have to be under 18, although\nhe must not be earning money.\nnb\u2014This procedure differs in\nScotland. The Inland Revenue\nproduce a form IR47 with\nspecimen covenants and brief\ndetails on their use, including\nScottish details. They will not,\nhowever, answer any detailed\nquestions you may have.\nHowever, Student Services will\nbe able to assist, and please feel\nfree to consult them on such\nmatters.\ng Page5 "

However for all his good intentions the quality of the food served in the refectories does not seem to have improved at all. Mooney is quite| prepared to refurbish the refectories, change the colour of the plates, paint the walls a different colour, move the refectories. He is prepared I to change just about anything except the food! A case in point is his reluctance to bring in microwaves to the! Union outlet to serve pub grub like baked potatoes, hamburgers( with meat in!), pies, etc. Most successful modern student union i refectories are self service and serve quick convenient fast food and salads. Mooney' s problem is that he is too old fashioned. He believes J in the old style of refectory service a substantial meal consisting of the traditional meat and two ve g. The Union has worked very constructively and very patiently on improving the food served in the refectories with limited success. Unless Mooney stops treating suggestions and complaints from the Union as mouthing s from overgrown children wanting a change of menu then the Union should consider taking things into their own hands. Come on Victor, how about giving usa shot at running the Union Refectory?' Fellows Dinner, You will see that there is an advert for the Fellows Dinner on page71 this week. It has nothing at all to do with Fellows, the idea stems from the collegiate system of Oxford and Cambridge where a formal dinner is held regularly in the place that you live. The dinner is open to anyone, not just people in Hall. There is a substantial College subsidy on the dinner so it is good value for money at just \u00a3 8 and is thoroughly recommended as a goodnight out.

PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO U GM TUESDAY.24TH JANUARY, 1984.\nUGC Response.\nAt the end of last term a small group of Union Officers discussed the issues\nof the UGC letter concerning the financial restrictions that are likely to\nbe imposed on institutions of higher education. Over the Christmas period\nDoth Peter Burt, External Affairs Officer, and I drafted separate responses\nbased on the discussion. Two days before the deadline, Monday 9th January,\nthe group, slightly diminished, met again and commented on both responses.\nWe found it difficult to combine the two replies although both agreed on\nessential issues, they expressed these views differently. As such both\nreports were submitted to College. We. are expected to reply to the College\ndraft in February.\nf4,0 QQ. At the end of last term, I discussed with the College Secretary the\npossibility of College financing the installing of showers in the Volleyball\nCourt area. John Smith agreed that College would finance this project, to\nthe degree of \u00a34,000.\nSuggestions & Complaints Committee.\ni have been asKed by the College to chair this Committee for the remainder\nof my year. Although, an extra commit t ment, I feel that this can only benefit\nthe Union as we now should have an increased ability to attempt to persuade\nCollege of the various improvements necessary in the refectory system.\nSouthside Disco.\nAfter various letters re the noise level on a Friday night and concern for\nneighbours, I met with various College representatives to discuss the issue.\nAfter a lengthy discussion they agreed that there was no cause for concern\nat present, if different events were held in the area, i.e. higher noise level,\nthen provision would have to be made. College accepted the responsibility of\nimproving the sound proofing of the area.\nTrie appearance of a new magazine last week has started a debate within ICU.\nThe magazine was produced by members of the College Administration without\nmy knowledge. Throughout last term the sabbaticals were approached on\nseveral occasions about the editorial style of Felix. We consistently\nmaintained that editorial freedom was an established right for Felix within\nIC Union and that we were unprepared to attempt to curb that freedom. Since\nChristmas several queries were received in the Union Office from members of\nthe administration about the running of Felix. Expecting some sort of problem\nfrom College we began to consider the implications if the College persisted.\nWe were not expecting to see the publication of a rival-I discussed with the Rector why this magazine had been published. There appears\nto be two primary reasons:\ni) It was to be used as a method of communication between staff.\nii) College felt that as the Sabbaticals were unwilling to comment on the\nstyle of Felix, they should produce a magazine making their\ndissatisfaction known.\nAt present it is uncertain whether this new magazine will continue.\nHONORARY SECRETARY'S REPORT TO UGM.\n1. Insurance.\na) Union Vans: After some discussion between Malcolm Aldridge, Commercial\nUnion and myself, Commercial Union are going to completely revise the\ninsurance premium for the Union Vans. Apparently I should receive a revised\nestimate by February, when the policy is due for renewal.\nb) Union Equipment: All the revised inventories I had received from Union\nClubs before Christmas have now been sent off to the insurers. The insurers\nwill be using these as a guide to draw up a new blanket policy for the Unions\nEquipment. This new policy, when drawn up will mean that any new equipment\nbought or borrowed by a club will be automatically insured - even without\ninforming the insurers.\n2. Union Duplicating Service.\nAt present I have two Gestetners working, however the old one is very\nunreliable and keeps eating up stencils. The Photocopier is working but needs\nservicing as it is giving out quite dirty photocopies - Iam at present waiting\nfor someone from Cannon to come round and take care of this.\n3.

Union Building.\nThe Furniture in the Union Building has at the time of writing been completely\nsorted out, making the Union Building almost reasonable but Iam sure by the\ntime of this meeting the forces of entropy will have caused the usual\nmigration of chairs and tables. The East Staircase should be in the process\nof being painted, and the infamous locks at the back of the Old Kitchen have\nbeen fitted at last.\n3. Bare and Refectories.\nMOTION ON GRENADA AMD LEBANON.\nThere are discussions going on within College that should lead to further\nreductions in bar prices. Iam continually hassling College about management\nproblems in the bars and refectories including the ill fated introduction of\nnew software. By the time of this meeting there will have been another\nRefectory Committee at which some progress should have been made. I live in\nhope. The guest beer for February is Ruddles.\n4. Estimates for Expenditure 84/85.\nMost clubs should be providing estimates of expenditure for next session to\ntheir relevant officers. The first draft will be produced early in February\nat which point I will start discussions with the Financial Secretary.\n5. Transport.\nFrazer Wigley has had to resign as Transport Officer and I would like to thank\nhim for all the hard work he has done. HL0, our latest van has now arrived\nand has been received very favourably.\nProposed by: Ian Wingfield, OSES PG.\nSeconded by: David Eagerton, OSES PG.\n1. The current foreign policy of military intervention by \u20ache USA in Grenada\nand Lebanon.\n2. The transgression of international law that the invasion of Grenada\nrepresents, and its similarity to the Argentine invasion of the Falkland\nIslands.\n3. The freedom of the peoples of Grenada and Lebanon to decide their own destiny, free from foreign military occupation.\n4. The doubt raised by American military intervention in Grenada over control-of cruise missiles deployed in this country.\nICU Believes:\n1. That no one country has the right to invade another and overthrow its\ngovernment purely on the basis of political and ideological motives.\n2. That the indigenous peoples of Grenada and Lebanon have a right to self\ndetermination free from foreign manipulation.\n3. That American control over nuclear weapons based in Britain represents a threat to the security of this country.\nICU Instructs:\n1. The President of this Union to write to President Reagan and the U.S. Ambassador to Britain condemning American military intervention in\nGrenada and Lebanon.\n2. That a representative of the overthrown Government of Grenada be invited\nto address the Union by the Secretary.\n3. That the Union actively campaign against the dangers of American control\nof cruise missiles in this country.\n\n"

    "content": "Mooncy\nGrilled\nA microwave oven is to be\ninstalled behind the Lounge Bar\nin the Union Building to extend\nthe range of food the bar serves.\nThe oven is initially on a three\nmonth trial period since ' Mr Victor Mooney, Refectories\nManager, is sceptical about its\nusefulness.\nThe instal ation of the oven\nfollows pressure from the Union\nthrough the Suggestions and\nComplaints Committee. Mr Mooney's reluctance to install\nthe oven has caused a long delay\nbetween the id eating proposed\nand its fruition. However, after a good deal of persistence by\nstudent reps on the refectory\ncommittees, Mr Mooney has\neventually had to agree to the\ninstal ation for a trial period.\nGraduates\nPresented\nUniversity of London graduates\nincluding IC graduates were\npresented to the Vice-Chancellor\nProfessor Randolph Quirk CBE at the Royal Albert Hall on\nWednesday.\nDuring the colourful ce re money, graduates filed across the\nstage and bowed or curtsied to\nthe Vice-Chancellor, resplendent\nin his black damask robe\ntrimmed with gold lace. Higher\ndoctors were hooded by Professor Quirk himself. The event was\nattended by family and friends of\nthe graduates.\nAll University of London\ngraduates are invited to attend\nsuch a presentation of which\nthere are three each year. They\nare in addition to the College\ncer i monies such as Imperial's Commemoration Day presentation of Associates of the Constituent Colleges.\nNew\nPublication\nA new College publication had its\nfirst issue last Friday. 'Fido' was\nproduced and written by\nmembers of the College staff,\nwith the approval of the Rector.\nIt is expected that 'Fido' will\nappear about three times a term,\nreplacing the demised 'Topic'.\nICU Slams UGC The Union has surpassed itself in\nresponding to the College's call\nfor submission on the UGC questionnaire on education cuts.\nNo less than two separate\nresponses have been given to\nCollege, one written by Union\nPresident Gaynor Lewis and the\nother by External Affairs Officer\nPeter Burt. It was felt that the\nreports were so different in style,\ndespite expressing similar views,\nthat they could not be merged.\nThe UGC has written to all\nVice-Chancellors and Principals\nasking for their views on how\ntheir institution will change in the\nnext five years assuming constant\nstudent numbers, either with or\nwithout a cut in the resources per\nstudent. The College will be\nformulating a response after\nsubmissions from departments\nand other bodies in College have\nbeen considered by the Board of\nStudies.\n\u2022The UGC letter also asks for\nviews on how higher education\nshould cope with the expected\ndrop in student numbers of 15 to\n20% between 1990 and 1995.\nAltogether there are 28 questions\ncovering all aspects of the future\nof higher education. The later\nquestions are intended to provoke debate and the College is\nnot intending to formally\nrespond to them. However the\nUnion responses address themselves to the whole series of\nquestions.\nIt is not widely believed that\nthe Union's comments will be\ntaken too seriously since they\nrestrict themselves to generalisations and idealistic rhetoric\nrather than directly answering\nthe UGC's questions. Miss Lewis\nin particular appears to completely miss the point of at least\none of the questions, and often\nher 'answers' seem to have little\nrelevance to the corresponding\nquestion, in the opinion of a number of people who have read\nher report.\nA mini Rag week planned last\nterm will go ahead in the second\nweek of March despite problems\nin obtaining street collection\nlicences.\nIt was thought that the week\nwould not go ahead after it was\ndiscovered that the applications\nfor collecting licences had been\nsubmitted too late. Rag Chairman James Benbow has\nhowever obtained the per misson of QE C and Chelsea College to\ncollect on their licences on the 9th and 10th of March. Although\ndetails of events for the week\nhave not been finalised plans are\nwell under way and will be\nannounced in the near future.\nMeanwhile the Royal College\nof Science Union have put Rag\nstunts back on a firm footing this\nyear with 25 students hobbling\naround South Kensington raising\nover \u00a350 for Rag on their three-legged pub crawl.\nThings were running smoothly\nuntil a group of five first years (on\na six legged crawl) got legless and\nfell out of step, collapsing in a large pile on Exhibition Road.\nCancer\nClues\n1\nAn IC research team has made a major breakthrough in under-t standing how cancer starts. The\n| team from the biochemistry\ndepartment, headed by Dr Peter\nRigby, has found that a set of\ngenes (called 'set 1' genes) that\nare active in tumour cells are\nalso active in normal embryo\ncells.\nThis result is thought to be of\nfundamental importance in cancer research, although 'for\nreasons which are not immediately obvious', according to\nNature. Rigby's experiment\nbegan by treating cultured mouse\ncells with atum oui forming virus\nand then comparing the genetic\nactivity with untreated cells.\nIt is thought that the repeated\npattern of 'set 1' genes in DNA may be responsible for deregulating the genetic activity in\ntumours. The idea is to be tested\nby performing similar experiment on other tissues.\nFor\nGods Sake\nGO! Colleges of Further Education\nare now taking control of the\nNational Union of Students\naccording to aij IC student who\nattended the recent NUS con-ference. John Passmore, Council\nChairman and former ICU President, attended the NUS conference as aUL U observer.\nAt last Monday's Council meeting he reported that whereas in\nthe past political groupings had\nbeen able to dominate NUS, at\nthis conference the colleges of\nFurther Education were able to\norganise themselves into a united\nvoting block.\nThe FE colleges have long felt\nthat the NUS has ignored their\ndemands. In particular NUS has\nnot been effective in campaigning\nfor better funding for student\nunions in the FE colleges.\nCouncil also had an extended\ndebate on FELl X's performance\nthis session. LMssatisfaction was\nexpressed in a practical way when\nPallab Ghosh, FELIX Editor,\nfailed to win a vote of confidence\nby 15 votes to 11 in a secret ballot.\nFELIX Friday, 20 January, 1984 \\ Page 3\n\n"

The i position of Rag Treasurer is also up for grabs, i If anybody is interested in either of the jobs I suggest that they have a chat with either Carl\nBurgess in the Sports Shop or myself in the\n:\nUnion Office or in the Elec Eng department.\nJob Description: Rag Mag Editor\n1\n. Compilation of new jokes. Best done by\nhanging around in bars with a tape recorder,\nas it takes much less coordination to press a button than it does to write.\n2.

The pro cu ration of cartoons and\narticles from humorous literature which j would be of interest to the average IC student.\nThis is done by writing to the publishers and\npaying the necessary fee.\n4. The writing of lots of material to fill in J the spaces left by censorship/bad jokes etc.\n5. Above all try to be original and make j the IC Rag Mag far superior to any other in\nthe country. You must produce a Rag Mag\nthat you, yourself, would pay 40p to read.\n6. Learn the\"usage of the machinery in the\nFELIX Office.\nJob Description: Rag Treasurer j The job of Rag Treasurer is quite s taigh t forward and enjoyable. I am sorry to be\ngiving it up, but the combination of chair-man, treasurer and academic work is just too\nmuch. The responsibilities are composed of:\n\u2014looking after the Rag accounts.\n\u2014ensuring that all money raised is paid\ninto the bank.\n\u2014taking bills to the Senior Treasurer for\npayment.\n\u2014keeping a running record of personal\ntotals.\nand a few other things.\nIf anybody is interested I will be glad to\ndiscuss the job with them and pass on any\nadditional information.\nThe appointments for the above positions\nwill take place at the Rag Committee meetings on 26 Jan in the UD H at 12:45pm. James Benbow\nWine A quick word to let the general public know-that Tuesday 21 Feb is the Wine Tasting\nSociety's Annual Dinner. The guest speaker\nwill be Mr Carr-Tayior from the Sussex CarrTaylor vineyards. It should prove to be an\nexcellent evening especially after Mr CarrTaylor has just reaped a bumper harvest of\ngrapes.\nTickets available on Tuesday wine tasting\nevenings from committee members.\nTai Chi Chuan Liberal Club\n(Supreme Ultimate Fist)\nTai-Chi Chuan is the system of exercise,\nmeditation and self-defence which the\nChinese practice in the parks in the early\nmornings.\nThe Tai-Chi form is a set of slow, extremely\nbeautiful, movements based on movements\nof animals and martial arts applications.\nThe practice of these movements causes a flow of energy or Chi to move through the\nacupuncture meridians of the body.\nLegend has it that Tai-Chi was developed\nin the 13th century and said to have been\ninspired by a battle between a crane and a snake. The crane struck strongly and per-s is tent ly, while the snake melted away from\neach attack.\nThe strong active movements of the crane\nand the yielding motion of the snake, symbolise the Y 'ang and Yin forces in the Universe\nand Tai-Chi is an expression of this natural\nflow.\nTai-Chi Chuan is principally an exercise in\nhealth and relaxation and in later stages an\nextremely powerful system of self-defence.\nAnyone interested in learning this art\nplease meet in the students union gymnasium\non Tuesday 24 Jan at 1:00pm where a demonstration will be given.\nover Club\nThe Hoverclub has recently been reformed\nand although coming under the City and\nGuilds' banner, membership is open to everyone in College.

New\nmembers are most welcome, so please come\nalong to our next meeting at 12:40 on\nTuesday in Southside Upper Lounge.\nMargaret Thatcher's attempt to 'Streamline\nthe Cities' in a manner very similar to Henry\nVIII's streamlining of Anne Boleyn will have\na dramatic effect on the accountability of\nLondon administrators to the rate payers who\nthey are supposed to be serving. Quite apart\nfrom the proposal's effects on London' salamander population, the plans concerning\nILEA and London Transport have a direct\neffect on Imperial College students. If you are\ninterested in what can be done about this,\ncome along to the Lounge above Southside at\n7:30 next Tuesday.\nThat blasted leopard has finally been passed\nback to its rightful owners and so, for the first\ntime in over two years, we are without a second mascot: so, any information leading\nto capture will be rewarded, as the Old Bill\nsay.\nLast Sunday, we held the Rarg 3-legged Pub\nCrawl which was a minor success with \u00a354\nraised, and lots of alcohol downed, thanks\nespecially to the maniacs from First Year\nMaths who decided on a6 leg crawl.\nOn Sunday we have the R CSU New Year\nBarnight\u2014this was supposed to be the Xmas\none but we had so much fun out singing Guilds at their Xmas Barnight we moved it.\nSo come along for beer, songs, boat and yard\nraces and anything else, from 7:00pm onwards in the Union Bar.\nThe following evening the hardened alcoholics\u2014ie the officers and reps\u2014gather in\nthe Lounge Lizards for the General Committee at 6:00pm so if you're on it, come or\napologise.\nComing soon on 5 Feb is the Rugby 7s tournament so get a team together and tell\nDigby Holman ( RCS RFC ist XV Capt)\nabout it.\nFinally don't forget the Annual Dinner on\nFriday 3 February at the International Hotel.\nTickets cost \u00a312.50 each and are available\nfrom the office and officers.\nWELL SOC LECTURE J FELIX)}\nWelcome back to another wonderful term\npacked full of J Soc parties, speakers, outings\netc. For those of you who missed our AGM atthe end of last term our new Committee .\nconsists of Laurence Gergel, Francine\nSternfeld, Simon Myers, Corinne Lander,\nAnthony Epstein, Jose Olausius.
