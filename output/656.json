    "content": "The Pill Poppy Day ICCAG\nThe Pill has hit the headlines again! Two\nreports indicated a link between taking the\npill and the later development of two of the\ncancers specific to women. However, the\nexact risk and whether any particular 'low\ndose' pill has a more pronounced effect on\nthis than another has yet to be fully worked\nout, but the likelihood of a woman, by taking\nthe pill, developing a cancer, which would not\nhave otherwise developed will be very small\nindeed. Other factors, such as inherited predispositions for the development of breast\ncancer would be far more influential.\nAt this level of increased risk, there is no\nneed to stop taking the pill, or immediately to\nchange to a different pill if you are taking one\nof the brands of the pill described in the media\nas a 'high risk' one. If you should wish to\ndiscuss your contraception wait until your\nprescription is due for renewal. By then the\nreports will have been better assessed so that\nyou can be given objective advice on the risks\nof taking the pill, and whether there is any\nneed to change from a pill which you are\npresumably used to and suits you, to a new\none.\nStopping the pill, without first acquiring\nanother effective means of contraception, is\nmore likely to cause problems (ie an\nunplanned pregnancy) than the remote possibility of developing cancer through continuing to take the pill. If you decide that you wish\nto stop taking the pill, and want advice on\nalternative means of contraception, please\nmake an appointment with one of the doctors\nat the Health Centre, where unbiased advice\nwill be given.\nAlan Swann\nICHS\nVegsoc\nFruit & Veg Tasting\nHave you ever longed to try a juicy\nkiwi fruit? Or fondle a gorgeous\npear? Or sink your teeth into\nsomething even more exotic?\nAt this fabulously opulent party,\nyou will be able to taste all sorts of\nfruit and vegetables (including\nfermented sorts!). \u2022\nDoors open at 6:30pm in the\nUnion S CR tonight. Entry is by\nmembership, terrific value at only\n50p. Page lOH PH HI^ HH HH n Poppy Day here already! Someone else after\nmy money! Why can't the Government pay!\nThe members of the Royal British Legion\nhave heard all the moans as we stand in the\ncold streets trying to boost the takings in our\ncollecting can nist ers. The war was over years\nago, why do they still carry on with Poppy\nDay?\nPeople soon forget the members of the\narmed forces that fought for our freedom in\nthe past and were wounded so badly that they'\nwere unable to support themselves, and indeed even in these days of uprising's and\nconflict, are still being wounded and maimed.\nThese forces don't moan and grumble when\nthey have to defend our rights to freedom.\nThey ask for no reward for their bravery. But\nwho knows better than the ex-serviceman\nwhat they need to help make their lives a lot\nhappier and easier. Homes where they can be\nlooked after, staff that can look after them,\napart from the comforts like TV sets, furniture articles, etc, etc.\nThe members of the Royal British Legion\nas ex-servicemen are always ready to stand by\nand help their comrades in the forces the best\nway we can, but we call upon all citizens to\nmake an army to help us to raise the necessary\nfunds in order that we may be able to fulfil\nour task, especially in these days of higher\nprices for everything needed.\nPlease give the poppy collectors your support by being even more generous with your\ndonations.\nYou can join us paying homage to the\nfallen heroes at the Putney Brige war memorial at 10:45am on Sunday 13 November if\nyou live nearby.\nThank you.\nFriday, 4 November, 1983\\\n\"ICCAG?....Oh you mean the Soup Run.\"\nUnfortunately that's all the community\naction group is renowned for, but that, we\nhope, is changing.\nAs well as helping down at an adventure\nplayground for disadvantaged children at\nActon on Saturdays and visiting old people at\nSt Pancras Hospital on Wednesday\nafternoon, you can now do something NEW.\nIt's called JOBBER SQUAD and is a project to give help to people in rather than out of\nthe community by doing practical jobs as well\nas talking to them, which is the purpose of the\nventure. If you have any practical skills arid\nhave something to give to such people by\ntalking to them then do join us. Jobs range\nfrom putting up curtain rails for a blind man\nto typing a letter of grievance to Mrs Thatcher\nfor an old lady in an old people's home.\nDespite these other activities you are still\nwelcome aboard the Soup Run which helps\n'down and outs' by giving them bread and\nsoup and conversation. This runs every Thursday evening at 9:30pm from Falmouth Hall\nKitchens (Keogh end). If you drive also, are\nover 21, have held your licence for over 18\nmonths and it is clean then we will pay for you\nto take the Union test to drive the soup run\nfor us.\nIf you are interested in us, then we are\ninterested in you and would love to see you at\nour meeting at 12:30pm Monday in ICCAG\nOffice (top of the Union) and at 12.30pm. Wednesday for the Jobbersquaders.\nThank you.\nConsoc\nThe main purpose of this article is to set the\nrecord straight on some matters which have\nbeen causing some confusion in this term's Felices. The ConSoc article in the Freshers'\nFELIX was genuine. The subsequent letter\nfrom me was a fake. None of the loony left-wing ranting s( of Martin Attwell, Michael\nNewman and others of that ilk) were faked by\nus\u2014we can leave them to make fools of them-selves. Moving on to the last normal FELIX: whilst the letter from Richard Monkhouse\n(Consoc exec member) was fake, the small-ad\nseeking \"a blonde/blue-eyed secretary\" was\ngenuine. Incidentally, no more applicants\nplease; I shall have to spend the next fortnight\ninterviewing those who have applied so far!\nSeriously though, this article is really written by me. We welcome anyone (first years in\nparticular) who would like to attend our committee meetings, and help us organise events.\nIf you are interested, simply go up to the\nUnion Office, and leave a note in the Consoc\nletter-racks, with your name, year and de-partment. We will then inform you of the date\nand place of our next meeting.\nJonathan Gerson\nNOTE: UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO LACK OF SPACE A NUMBER OF CLUB ARTICLES HAVE BEEN OMITTED. PRIORITY IS GIVEN TO SHORT ARTICLES ADVERTISING FORTHCOMING EVENTS. FELIX\nHuman Rights Week\n5-9 December\nIt is essential that any club wishing to participate in Human Rights Week should attend the\nHRW SCC exec meeting, on Monday 7 November, 1:00pm, Green Committee Room.\nClubs should have a clear idea of the campaigns they wish to pursue during the week and be\nwilling to discuss the campaign with the SCC exec.\nNote: Clubs that are not represented may not be able to take part in Human Rights Week.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters H Cover\nNonsense\nDear Pallab\nI was surprised to see that the\ncover of last week's careers\nissue of FELIX portrayed a German nazi officer pointing a gun at a collection of unlikely-looking job applicants. The\nfigure was also wearing an armband which apparently read\nYoung Conservatives.\nThere are two main\nobjections to this portrayal: it\nmakes no sense ei the i politically or historically. You;\ncartoonist, Guy Riddihough,\nexplained that he was trying to\nrepresent the kind of treatment\noften experienced at Job\nCentres. The nazis were\nresponsible for unprovoked\naggression against neighbouring countries and the\nultimate invasion and\nsubjugation of most of Europe,\ntorture and repression of\npolitical opponents, the\ndestruction of many European\ncities and industries, making\nhalf of Europe's people into\nhomeless refugees, attempted\ngenocide, the looting of many\nof Europe's art treasures, the\ndeaths of thousands upon\nthousands of people, and other\natrocities. I know from\nexperience that our Job Centres\nare not always perfect, but surely\nthey don't mete out this sort of\ntreatment. The naivety of the car-toon's attempted message is further compounded by the fact that\nthe Nazis were able to win support from the German people before the war by effectively eliminating unemployment.\nSecond, the cartoon tries to\ndraw a parallel between the\nConservative Party and hence\nthe present government's policies, and the nazis. Such a link is clearly absurd and causes\ngrave offence to those of us who\nhold Conservative views.\nAccusing the present government of fascist policies, as has\nbecome common among u the\nextreme left, shows e it ler a total ignorance of the meaning\nof fascism or a deliberate misuse of the word as an insult. I would not have expected\nFELIX to have tried to draw\nsuch a parallel for either reason.\nMr Riddihough is clearly a cartoonist with considerable\nartistic talent. However, I would suggest that if he intends\nto continue to draw political\ncartoons he first makes some\nattempt to understand the\npolitical implications of what\nhe is drawing. As for you,\n(Letters-to-f he I^ iW.\nPallab you ought to know\nbetter.\nYours etc\n(J) Martin Taylor\nSports Drivel\nDear Pallab\nIs FELIX the newspaper of\nImperial College Union?\nOr, perhaps, is it being used\nas a once weekly exposition of\nthe regular few?\nI refer to the sports page in\nthe issue dated 21 October. For\nonce, one of the College clubs\nsought to contact the masses of\nImperial in the most effect way\npossible. The message was a sincere plea for the table tennis\nplayers from last season who\ncould spare the odd evening to\nhelp the club out, to come\nforward.\nWas this plea printed? No!!\nInstead, the sports page had a remarkably familiar appear-ance; indeed apart from the\nabsence of a Sailing Club report\ncould have been taken from any\none of last year's issues! In\nplaces where the plea could\nhave been printed were\nparagraphs of utter drivel\nwhich probably meant nothing\nto the club members, let alone\nthe average reader (I refer to the\nBadminton report especially).\nGraeme Cant\n(See Sports Page-Sports Ed)\nPG Supervision\nDear Pallab\nI am writing to add a postscript to Chris Hendy's article about postgraduate\ncourses in the Careers FELIX.\nHe dealt in some detail with the\nfinancial side of PG education\nbut did not mention super-vision.\nWhat sort of person is the\nprospective supervisor? Do you\nget on with him well enough to\nbuild up a satisfactory working\nrelationship\u2014one that will\nstand the stress of experimental\nsetbacks and of the long grind\nof writing up? Has he got your\nproject planned down to the last\ndetail, or are you to be given a vague working title\u2014little more\nthan afr arne work for a test of\ninitiative? What sort of person\nare you and what sort of\nsupervision suits you\nbest\u2014would your supervisor\nprovide it?\nThese are some of the most\nobvious points to be\nconsidered. W 'th luck the PG\nAffairs Seminar in January will\nprovide an opportunity for\nasking other, more general,\nquestions. In the meantime: go\nand interview your prospective\nsupervisor!\nYours sincerely\nMelanie Quin-Steel\nBSc, MSc, (PhD student)\nDrunken\nRamblings\nDear Sir\nI hope you will except the\nviews of an ex-student of IC on\nthe recent Commem Ball. To\n' me it is the Grand Finale of\nsheer hypocrisy that presides in\nthe governing bodies of\nImperial College. The pretence\nof concern and appraisal for\nstudents in an establishment\nwhere the standard of lecturing\nis appalling and the staff-student communication is\nabsolutely minimal. The\nappeasement of Union officers\nyear after year by the Rector in\ntheir quest for better standards\nof education is now a standing\njoke among College hierarchy.\nIn my short time at another\nuniversity the difference is\nclearly noticeable where\nlecturers and staff seem almost\nhuman, and prices in the bar are\nnot quite so extortionate. It\nmay well be that IC is unique in\nthis phenomenon, resting on\nthe laurels of a government\nblessing and destroying the\nfabric of a great Victorian\nvision. _\nYours soberly\nC Boyd\nPS: Pallab: Don't print this letter\nif it gets me in the shit.\nAfter Our\nMoney\nDear Pallab\nI was most surprised to hear\nthat Neil Stewart, NUS\nPresident, has been invited to\nspeak at the next UGM. What\ncan he possibly hope to achieve?\nThe arguments against NUS\nmembership have not changed\nin the last year. The real cost of\nmembership would be 15% of\nICU's disposable income; this\nmoney would have to be found\nfrom the CCUs and clubs and\nsocieties, which would\nun doubt ably cause hardship for\nmany of these. And what\nexactly do we get in return for\nthis huge outlay?\nIn fact, in 1979/80, over 90%\nof NUS's income was spent on\nbureaucracy, administration\nand conferences. IC is big\nenough to be able to provide the\nwelfare and other services that\nmight make NUS membership\nattractive to smaller colleges\nwho cannot do so, and\nduplication of such effort\nwould have no benefit for us.\nIn this letter I have\ndeliberately made no mention\nof the extremist political stance\nof the NUS, as this would not\ndirectly affect IC students in the\nway that the loss of money from\nthe CC Us and Major Subcommittees would. Don't forget: it's our money they're\nafter!\nYours, in the money,\nRich Monkhouse\nLiberal\nMeasures\nDear Pallab\nAppearing in this newspaper\nshould be the results of a raffle\nconducted several weeks ago\nfor the prize of some bottles of\nwine and champagne. For those\nof us who like drinking, and I am one, this may seem a welcome diversion, heralding\npossibly the frequent\ndistribution of free booze by the\nUnion. My only slight criticism\nis related to the presence of\nseveral questions on the raffle\nticket.\nTo introduce a questionnaire\non NUS membership into the\npresent climate of ignorance or\nbias, especially one clearly\nwritten by someone against\nre affiliation is pointless. Given\nthe incentive of a chance of\nwinning some booze, the reply\nfor those who don't know the\nissues involved is likely to be in\nthe direction indicated by the\nquestions. As I said, a pointless\nquestionnaire if a reasoned reply\nis expected, and a dishonest one if\nany weight is to be attached to the\nresults.

We are also hoping to\ncollaborate with the College Health Centre in\nproviding some kind of information service\nfor women in College concerned about the\nrecent contraceptive pill warnings. So far this\nterm we have had a speaker from the London\nRape Crisis Centre and future speakers include Christine Sutton of the New Scientist\nand Sarah Maitland (author of a recent book\non Feminism and Christianity). If you\nhaven't yet been to any WIST meetings we\nwould welcome you at future events.\nWith regards to other College activities we\nfeel that two events namely the Honorary\nPornographer's Night and the Mines Revue,\nat which pornographic films and strippers are\nshown are an insult to the dignity of all IC\nstudents. We are amazed that such events are\nstill allowed to take place on College premises\nsince not only do they contain material which\nis degrading to women in general but particularly to those at Imperial. It is sad when a college which claims to look forward to an\nincrease in its number of women students\nputs this possibility still further into the future by permitting these events and thereby\ncondoning them.\nWe therefore urge all students at Imperial\nand especially all WIST members to go to the\nU GM on 8 November and vote for the 'anti-porn' motion.\nSusan Watts\nSIMIAILIL AIDIS\nFOR SALE\n\u2022Hillman Super Minx 1964. good\nrunner, tax and MoT, must sell to pay\nrent.

    "content": "Reviews\nIn Ray Bradbury's Farenheit\n451 we discover a vision of the\nfuture in which all books are\nburnt and ironically the dissenters become the books. They\nmemo rise the words, their minds\nbecoming libraries and archives.\n'Fahrenheit 451' is the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns. Montag is\nemployed by a state that does\nnot allow any kind of record. The\nonly official communication and\nnews comes from cornflakes'\nsoap operas of mind-numbing\nsimplicity on wall to wa\ntelevision screens. Orwell's'1984' newspeak philosophy that\nif you control words you control\nbehaviour, we can only\nconsciously do what we are\ncapable of thinking of doing, is\nportrayed excitingly and with\nsome of the brilliance of Orwell.\nMontag is a fireman using\nkerosene in place of water to\nburn secret libraries. He enjoys\nhis work until a series of events\nand mere inquisitiveness set him\nagainst his job, his wife and his\nsociety.\nAs this is the first book review of the year I would not\nonly like to introduce you to a number of books but also,\nalong the way, welcome you in my own fashion to the\nworld of print. This article is not simply my review, it has\nbehind it the opinions of volunteers like Carl Burgess\nand Guy R^d di hough who have read the books and written short paragraphs on them. If you feel like a good or\neven a bad read just leave your name and department at\nthe FELIX Office and we will give you a book. A book, if it\nis a good one, is a part of the human mind with its\nmemories, emotions and thoughts. I hope this article will\nencourage you to read and enjoy some of the books I mention. Michael Newman\nBoth George Orwell and Ray\nBradbury have written their\ncelebrations of the importance of\nthe written word and the\nfreedom of expression that we\nallow it. They also give us a warning, not just against official\ncensorship but more importantly\nagainst self-imposed censorship.\nOur general apathy towards\nreading, our prejudice fuelling\nignorance of those we disagree\nwith, enclosing our minds in their\nown regimes of '1984'.\nThe publishing world is a very\nharsh and profit-geared industry,\nthough probably no more so than\nany other. If a book does not fulfil\nthe publishers requirements for\nbeing marketable then back goes\nthe manuscript with a rejection\nslip. 'Watership Down' was\nrejected no less than six times\nbefore a publisher was found\nwilling to take it. John Mortimer,\ncreator of 'Rumple of the Bailey',\nhas criticised this overpowering\nyet unrecognised censorship. He\nbelieves freedom of expression in\nprint should be the right not just\nof 'good' authors, or the famous,\nor formula writers but of\neveryone. Afterall, there is a book in all of us.\nFELIX \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJohn Mortimer's books need\nno recommendation. Penguin\nhave recently brought out A First Rumpole Omnibus\nincluding the titles: Rumple of the\nBailey, the Trials of Rumpole and\nRumple Returns. They have also \u201e\npublished Rumpole and the\nGolden Thread which was\ntelevised in September.\nPhilosophers are the world's thinkers, defenders of our\nfreedoms by the cut and thrust of\ntheir words. The Worldly\nPhilosophers are the economic\nthinkers, men as great and\ndiverse as Adam Smith,\nThorstein Veblen, Thomas\nMalthus, Karl Marx and John\nMaynard Keynes.\nRobert Heilbroner wrote his\nbook as a graduate in 1953 and it\nis a great tribute to him that the\nfifth revised edition was brought\nout by Pelican last August. It is a remarkable book full of life and\nclarity, somewhat unusual for a work on the history of economics\nand its researchers. It relives the\nstory from the time when there\nwas no economics to a controversial and challenging\nconclusion on today's world of\nthe multi-national companies. If\nyou are interested in history,\neconomics or politics it should be\ncompulsory reading.\nAnother brand of thinker,\ncloser to the hearts of you at this\ncollege, are the physicists. Up to\nthe First World War and even\nduring some of it, there was an\ninternational community of\nphysicists, speaking freely across\nignored boundaries of nations. In\nGottingen, Germany, students\nand researchers alike would\ndiscuss their theoretical worlds\nand use the table tops of the\ncafes to expand and solve their\nabstract equations. The table\ntops were never washed during\nthat time. This all changed with\nthe First and Second World\nWars. Patriotism, secrets,\nmilitary and government control\nof science, nuclear weapons.\nNight Thoughts of a Classical Physicist delves into\nthe mind of an old professor of\nphysics living in Germany in\nSeptember 1918. He is dying and\nwith him Germany and classical\nphysics. A moving novel of the\nchanges and destructiveness of\nhistory as seen by a single man\nand his night thoughts.\nRobert Jungk's personal\nhistory of the atomic scientists\nBrighter Than A Thousand\nSuns tries to examine the minds\nand lives of the important\nphysicists from 1918 to 1955. It is\nan historical record, though\nmany might disagree with some\nof its facts and interpretations.\nAs a story of the people behind\nthe nuclear bomb, trying to solve\nmathematical and engineering\nproblems that would before the\nend of the war destroy two\nJapenese cities, it is a book I found difficult to put down. The\nquestions it asks, the problems of\nscience and morality and\nhumanity it poses, are all very\nrelevant today.\nA group of physicists at this\ncollege, a part of the continuing\ndrama and dilemma that now\nface not only them but all of us,\nhave had a new book published.\nBarry Rubin, Philip Weber and\nGraeme Wilkinson are coauthors of the Penguin special\nCrisis Over Cruise. The latest\nmissile to join our arsenal will be\narriving within the next two\nmonths. This is an appropriate\nbook for all of us, multilateral is t, unilateral is t and more\nimportantly the undecided. It\ngives the information and\nimplications of the arrival of the\nweapons in a short and precise\nway.\nThose of you who have seen\nthe movie War Games will not\nwant to buy the book, those of\nyou who have not should go and\nsee the film.\nFahrenheit 451 by Ray\nBradbury, Grenada (Panther\nScience Fiction).\nNineteen Eighty-Four by\nGeorge Orwell, Penguin \u00a31 *95.\nA First Rumpole Omnibus\n\u00a33.50. ,\nRumpole and the Golden\nThread both written by John\nMortimer and published by\nPenguin \u00a31.75.\nThe Worldy Philosophers by\nRobert L Heilbroner, Penguin\n\u00a32.50.\nNight Thoughts of a Classical\nPhysicist by Russell McCormmach, Penguin \u00a32.95.\nBrighter than a Thousand\nSuns by Robert Jungk, Penguin\n(Pelicans).\nCrisis Over Cruise by Barry\nRubin, Philip Weber and Graeme\nWilkinson, Penguin \u00a31.25.\nI Friday, 4 November, 19831 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nNUH THE CASE FOR REAFFILIATION\nNo one but the longest serving\npostgraduate in Imperial College\nwill remember being in membership of the National Union of\nStudents. For that reason alone it is\nworth considering a revote on NUS\nmembership. The entire generation\nwho voted us out have now passed\non. In the student handbook NUS\ngets only a perfunctory mention\nbut a number of basic reasons are\ngiven as to wh v we left NUS. I believe that all of these reasons have\nnow been overtaken by events and\nreforms in the National Union of\nStudents and not only should you\nconsider joining NUS but that\nwhen the vote comes up that vote\nshould be for membership.\nThey said, when you left, that\nNUS was too bureaucratic. Since\nthen it has reduced the size of its\nstaff and now has only 70 staff\nmembers, less than many big\nuniversities students unions, to\nservice the member hip of 750\nstudent unions and 1.4m students.\nAmongst those staff over three\nquarters of them work on research,\ncampaigning, regional representation to local government and\ncommunications. The National\nUnion of Students has moved its\nheadquarters from the centre of\nLondon and has recently imposed\ncuts on its internal budgets of\n\u00a3220,000 from a budget of \u00a3 1.4m. NUS has disposed of the large\ncommercial empire which it had\nbuilt up, although it keeps a strong\ninvolvement in all areas of commercial services to students. It now\nconcentrates on influencing company policies and negotiating deals\nrather than adventures into business on its own. It now believes that\nthe most effective role it can play is\nthe coordination of the massive\npurchasing power of students in\nthis country. Students unions alone\nhave a turnover in excess of \u00a360m and the purchasing power of\nstudents as a whole exceeds\n\u00a3 1,000m. The parallels between the\ncollective influence in commercial\nservices and working collectively\nfor political gain should be obvious\nto anyone with common sense.\nThe second reason given for\nd is safi li ation was that NUS was\n'undemocratic'. Since you left the\nNational Union we have implemented 'compulsory cross campus\nsecret ballots' in which every\nstudent has the right to stand and\nevery student has the right to vote\nfor delegates to each of the two\nnational conferences that are held\neach year. The national confer-en ces, which were a major bone of\ncontention, have also been re-formed. Over \u00a380,000 worth of\nsavings have been made on the\nconference budget and NUS has\nabolished its January meetings\naltogether. The whole emphasis has\nbeen shifted away from glad i to rial political battles to make the\nconferences a working exchange of\nideas and information between\nstudent union officers. NUS also\nFELIX BB HH H Hi NUS President Neil Stewart\nhas a complicated system of\nproportional represent afi on on its\nnational executive which guarantees any group with a sixth of the\nvotes at least one person on the\nexecutive, any group with one fifth\nof the votes at least two people and\nany group with a quarter of the\nvotes at least three and possibly\nfour representatives. While still\nguaranteeing that the majority on\nthe executive will be fully committed to union policies. NUS is\nnow led by Labour students who,\nwhatever your opinion of their\npolitical views, are a recognisable\nnational force.\nThirdly we are told that NUS was\nfar too expensive. It is hard to\nimagine what criteria this was\njudged. Membership of NUS is not\npaid from the pockets of individual\nstudents but from student union\nmoney provided by the college\nauthorities. NUS has recently\nchanged its subscriptions system to\nguarantee that if the money to\nindividual student unions goes\ndown then the NUS subscription\nwill go down. And this year many\ncolleges have in fact . had re-duct ions. Although the affiliation\nas a block represents thousands of\npounds when that is divided by the\nnumber of students it works out at\nno more than \u00a34 or \u00a35 a head. And\nwhen you realise that even these\nsums of money represent less than\nsix or seven percent of the Imperial\nCollege Student Union budget it is\nnot unreasonable to spend that sum\nof money when our student grants,\nour travel awards and increasingly '\nthe future of our courses and\ncolleges are taken 100% at national\nlevel. Indeed NUS' campaign to\nprotect travel awards will have\nsaved the majority of Imperial\nstudents well over \u00a3100 in travel\nexpenses in London last year alone. Lancaster University recently\ndid an audit of the benefit to their\ni Friday,4 November, 1983\nstudents of the work done by NUS.\nHere are some of the examples. In\n1981 the NUS intervention with Dr\nRhodes Boyson saved Lancaster\nUniversity at least \u00a350,000 each\nyear on its student union budget.\nSecondly on housing benefit because NUS managed to get eligibility extended to students on\ncampus they benefited to a tune of\nover \u00a330,000. While off campus\nstudents were getting an extra\n\u00a350,000 due to rate rebates arising\nfrom national work done by NUS.\nAnd if test cases being pushed by\nNUS for eligibility during vacation\nwins then students at Lancaster will\nbe able to claim a further \u00a390,000 a year in vacation rent. The DES\nplan to limit travel expenses would\nhave cost Lancaster students over\n\u00a380,000 a year and the legal\nprecedents set by House of Lords\nJudgement earlier this year meant\nthat overseas students in Lancaster\nreceived refunds of over \u00a3120,000\nand if the follow up legal action by\nNUS is successful a further\n\u00a3 150,000 will have to be paid out to\n' students who were overcharged.\nThey even give an example of how\nNUS made \u00a3600 worth of legal fees\navailable to take up a test case on\nbehalf of an individual student who\nultimately received a settlement\nworth \u00a38,000 and if we remember\nthat students here at Imperial\nreceived grants which total well\nover \u00a37m we begin to realise the\nscale on which the NUS operates\nand put its subscriptions in some\nsort of perspective. At a rough\neu ess. since Lancaster has only\n4,000 students, it is likely, given that\nrents are higher in London, you\nhave more overseas students at\nImperial and that travel costs are\nimmensely higher in the London\narea that all those figures could\napply equally to Imperial College\nand would be very likely to be much\nhigher.\nAlthough you are able to get\nmany of the benefits of NUS\nwithout actually being in member-ship. You should at least have the\nhonesty to admit that those benefits\ndepend on the work of the National\nUnion and the detailed advice it can\ngive individual student unions on\nhow to ensure that their students\nhave those benefits. The truth is\nthat a great deal of your welfare\nwork is based on research and work\ndone by NUS which you manage to\nget through other channels, such as\nthe University of London Union.\nThe argument about how you\nchange NUS has clearly been won\nby those people who decided to stay\nin NUS and work from the inside.\nNot only have they changed it but\nat the same time they have\nmanaged to defend a great many\nstudent facilities and rights. Even\nthis Conservative government still\nrecognises NUS as the voice of\nstudents and government ministers\nand civil servants regularly meet\n\u2022 NUS to discuss problems many of\nwhich affect us. At the moment the\nNUS view goes forward without a democratic imput from Imperial\nCollege. The weight and force of\narguments which you could bring\nto bare on national discussion are\nsimply not there. All the promises\nthat were made by people who said\nthat Imperial should d is affiliate from NUS, and that you would still\nbe able to speak to MPs and make\neffective representation to government ministers has simply not come\ntrue.\nThe real question is one of\nstudent unity. Student unions are\nnot trades unions and as a breakaway you are not able to\nexercise local industrial muscle.\nThe only thing that students have\ngot going for them is their\nenormous numbers and their\nability to argue their case co-he rent ly. But those are only affective if we are coordinated by a national organisation and if we\nunite with students in other col-leg es. The NUS has demonstrated\nin rounds of discussions on student\ngrants and in opposition to student\nloans that when it coordinates\nstudents effectively it can ^defeat\ngovernment proposals and change\nthe policies of all the political\nparties. >\nI think Imperial College should\nhave a referendum on NUS membership next term. Edinburgh\nUniversity executive have recommended their students should consider rejoining and the topic is up\nfor discussion in other d is affiliates. But before you decide we ought to\nhave a series of informed debates\nover several weeks involving NUS\nspeakers and those who disagree\nwith NUS, to hear all the arguments. That can be the only basis\non which Imperial students make\nup their own minds, hear of the\nchanges that have been made, and\nhopefully decide to re affiliate. Neil Stewart\n\\Page 5\n\n"

John Scott\nNow for the Bull\nAffiliation to UAU allows IC clubs and students to compete against other universities\nand colleges of universities under the name of\nIC, rather than through ULU (although there\nare no restrictions on a student playing for\nULU as well).\nThe affiliation commences in 1983/4 session but unfortunately will not benefit all of\nthe ACC clubs. This has been discussed extensively by ACC and was regretted but\naccepted, being due to the timing of our\naffiliation (after fixture lists had been drawn\nup) resulting in a reduced (negotiated)\naffiliation fee. This will allow some\nparticipation this year and will lead to full\nparticipation for 1984/5 session.\nThe actual details of the competitions\ncentre around regions and groups therein.\nFor instance, IC could compete against\nSurrey, Sussex, LSE, UCL or City. The\nwinner(s) of the recognised leagues move to\nthe next round, where travel further afield eg\nManchester, Loughborough is likely, as is\nstiffer opposition.\nACC club captains will shortly be receiving\ncopies of the U AU Handbook if any club\nmember has any queries could they contact\nIan Bull in the Union Office at lunchtimes.\n(Ian's also the man to see for rubber blow-up\ndolls of Norman Tebbitl-Sports Ed)\nWe now have the following regular times for\ndry slope skiing at Blue Sky Ski, Hillingdon:\nTuesday evening (intermediates instruction)\nmeet Southside Lounge 6:30pm; Wednesday\nafternoons (beginners instruction) meet\nSouthside Lounge 1:00pm.

Anne was\nreluctant to join in this, as she preferred\ndemolishing chocolate digestive s. Dom\nmanaged to keep his temper in a match for the\nfirst time ever, much to Janet's relief, and I was still drying off from the night before (the\naquatic incident in southside!)

On investigating the\nladies lavatories, they found the\nyoung lady who appeared to be\nquite seriously injured.\nThere was so much blood\nsplattered all over the toilets it\nwas initially thought that she had\nbeen stabbed. However it was\nlater found that no weapon had\nbeen used.\nThe man and woman had come\nto the party together and had\napparently had a lovers' tiff. The\nman later followed her into the\nladies toilets and beat her up.\nThe man returned to the party\nwhere he behaved aggressively,\nt ngh ten ing people there. He was\nheld at the party until taken by\nthe police to Gerrard Rd police\nstation. He was released the next\nmorning when the woman, who\nhad spent the night in St Stephens\nHospital declined to press\ncharges against him.\nMs Christine Teller, ICU\nDeputy President, has banned\nLatin-American Society from\norganising events in the Union\nBuilding. However, neither of the\npersons involved are at College,\nand the man was restrained by\nLatin American Society\nmembers when they realised\nsomething was wrong with him.\nLatin American Society feel\nthey have been very badly treated\nby Ms Teller.\nThe toilet in which the attack\noccurred.

The results of\nthe NUS survey which have been\ncirculated around College will\nalso be known on Tuesday.\nThe annual \u00a313,000 affiliation\nfee is generally felt to be more\nthan IC Union can afford. The\nNUS has therefore proposed an\ninitial payment of \u00a35,000 for the\nfirst year, followed by \u00a3 10,000 for\nthe second year and \u00a313,000 for\nthe third year. However the\noverall deficit of \u00a38,000 would\nhave to be made up by ICU at a later stage.\nIt is possible for IC students to\naffiliate personally, by writing to\nthe NUS national office.\nNo.656\\\nAn impromptu concert was given on the steps of the Albert Hall on\nSunday night by Melanie, the American folk rock singer and star of\nWoodstock '68.\nShe had been due to play in the Albert Hall the same night but the\nconcert was cancelled as not enough tickets were sold.\nIn an interview with FLEIX Melanie said, \"I had to play, all the\npublicity was still up, and I didn't want to disappoint anyone who had\nturned up to see me.\" None of the 150 people listening seemed at all\ndisappointed.\nIFELIX, November 4, 79831 \\Free!\n\n"

(There's not enough shouting, come on lads, more\nrunning, etc, said in dull monotone.) IC then\nturned on a second half performance of pure\npower. The rout of QMC was started by N Horespool with a finely headed goal.

    "content": "3it ori a[ NUS\nThe NUS debate is coming up again, as it does every year. However\nthis year NUS are really making a big push to get us to re affiliate, especially by bringing their biggest gun NUS President Neil Stewart\nto the U GM on Tuesday.\nAs Neil says in his article on page 5 the reasons we d is affiliated no\nlonger exist. NUS are less political, they are less wasteful with student\nunions\" money and they really do provide a valuable service for\nstudents. Without their efforts nationally all student grants, induing ours, would be much much lower.\nAnyone who says NUS does nothing for IC students doesn't know\nwhat he is talking about. We are benefiting from the activities of NUS\nwithout paying a penny. The moral reasons for affiliating are over-w hel ming. However we've got ourselves in a financial hole. If we are to find\nthe annual \u00a313.000 affiliation fee (don't be fooled by any trick\ndeals\u2014it works out to \u00a313,000 a year whichever way you juggle the\nfigures) it means some of the services, clubs and societies of this\nUnion are going to have to be cut. Are you pre ap red to join NUS at\nthe cost of having no CC Us or no Boat Club or no Gliding Club? This\nis what you must decide over the next few months for a possible\ncampus-wide ballot. Do go to the U GM on Tuesday to hear Neil\nStewart speak.\nFELIX Retraction\nSmce the publication of the Careers FELIX last week a couple of\npeople from Industrial Society have told me that they found some of\nthe material in that issue not to their liking. They have asked me to\nmake it quite clear that their only contribution to that issue was a couple of very badly written articles (which were not used) and a long\nboring list of companies visiting IC at the Careers Fair.\nIt seems as if the people running Industrial Society are far more\nconcerned about impressing their prospective employers than helping people to get jobs. I would have thought it was obvious to anyone\nthat it would be quite beyond the obnoxious little tw at s in Industrial\nSociety to produce an informative and readable Careers FELIX. Just\nto set the record straight it was produced largely through the efforts\nof Dr Neil Harris and his colleagues in the Careers Advisory Service\ntogether with the FELIX staff.\nCredits\nLynne James, Carolyn Aldred, Jon Jones, Andy Cave, Simon Nield,\nSteve Brann.

Do not send the crossword in yet but wait\nuntil it appears in FELIX at the right time.

Other attractions included a steam engine rally, a steam organ and a Victorian fancy dress competition.\nNo Gigs, No Parties\nEver!\nIC Ents committee have had to\nturn down concerts by two big\nname rock groups The Alarm\nand The B52s next term because\nof a$ even week block booking of\nthe Union Concert Hall by IC\nOperatic Society. All future\nconcerts and parties in the Union\nBuilding are also in jeopardy\nbecause of court injunctions\nthreatened by Albert Hall mews\nresidents.\nThe Ents committee had arranged to have well known rock\ngroups at College every week but\nmay now have to cancel a large\nnumber of gigs because' no\nalternative venues are available.\nThe Great Hall was used in the\nearly 70s by such artists as Jimmy\nHendrix and Pink Floyd. However stiff regulations were introduced by the GLC after the\nspink ler s in the Great Hall were\nset off during a concert. These\nregulations included the\nprovision of crash barriers, a central control room and a back-up\ngenerator in 1977. The College\nestimate for these alterations was\n\u00a3 18,550 which was considered excessive at the time.\nBut in the light of the objections by local residents, Christine\nTeller, IC Union Deputy President, is now investigating the\npossibility of using the Great\nHall for concerts again.\nIC Pass Go and Collect\n\u00a3 2 0 0 !\nLast Saturday the Monopoly Rag\nstunt was held on a bigger board\nthan most, the City of London\nitself. Each street and station\nrepresented on a Monpoloy\nBoard was visited by each team.\nDave Parry the Royal College of\nScience Vice President and James\nBenbow organised the event so ,\nwell and made it so exciting that\nthe collection of money for the\nBoys' Club was almost forgotten.\nEach team was given a set of\ncryptic clues which led them to\nplaces in every street and station.\nTo add to their problems eight\nmarshall s, dressed in disguising\nattire, travelled around London\npouncing on the teams with\nCommunity Chest and Chance\ncards, including a 'Go to Start'\ncard which involved a trip to the\nTower of London.\nThe winning team with the\nunlikely name of Joan Collins\ncollected \u00a361. Guilds with 50\npeople collected \u00a3176. RCS with\n50 pe op lle collect e \u00a3102. The\nmammoth game took the teams\n8'/2 hours to complete, and with\nno bankruptcies. Another\nMonopoly Rag stunt is being\nplanned for Rag Week.\nIn a desperate FELIX publicity\nbid Guilds President Mike 'Boy\nGeorge' Stuart has admitted to\ntrans vest it is m.\"I'm a self-confessed owner of\na pink dress, and a damned fool,\"\nsaid mincing Mike. \"I wear the\ndress at parties\u2014it goes down\nwell with the boys in Guilds.\"\nIt is widely thought that this\nblatant publicity stunt is a last-ditch effort to salvage what\nremains of his sabbatical credibility. Growing criticism of Mike\nStuart's presidential ability has\nbeen apparent in Guilds in recent\nweeks. The recent fresher s din-ni ers fiasco led Michael seriously\nto reconsider his position.\nMark Coulthread Guilds DP\ncommented \"I went rigid when I heard the news about Mike. It\nwas like a bolt from the blue.\"\nSmith\nSnubbed?\nMr John Smith, College number\n2, has been moved out of his large\ncomfortable office and into a small cramped former meeting\nroom in the new College block\nrational is ation scheme.

    "content": "Presenting the new, improved\nFELIX music page: three bands,\ntwo pictures and one new writer\nGuy Riddihough who reports on\nWendy and the Rockets. Less\npicturesque are Sad Among\nStrangers who play tonight's Guy\nFawkes Party in the JCR and the\nComsat Angels who played an\nexcellent gig last Friday.\nLIVE! Five Australians play rock'n 'roll\nFriday night was a classic night on the\ntelly; it began with the return of The Tube\nwhere Tina Turner strutted her stuff to\nCat people, River Deep Mountain High\nand her new single, PIL treated us to\nAnarchy in the UK and two of their top\nten hits and the Eurhythmies dazzled\nwith three excellent new songs. It ended\nlate with Brando rebelling against 'what\nyou got' in The Wild One.\nIn between there was time to nip out\nand catch the Comsat Angels who kept\nstandards consistently high with a perky set and well deserved their two\nencores. The band played just over an\nhour in all and featured almost all of their\nnew album LAND. Mercifully they left\nout the two weakest tracks and am ped up Worlds Away (a dod gy song on al bum) with thundering bass. As mentioned last week the Comsat Angels\nare a punk band turned pop and it Independence Day, a song featured on albums\nfrom both styles, which showed where\ntheir real strength lies.\nAlthough songs like Will you stay to-night?, Alicia and Island Heart are all\nexcellent chart-hit fodder and hence\nvery accessible and immediate live, the\nbrooding, more aggressive Total War\nand Waiting for a Miracle (both from the\nfirst album) sounded even better. Also\nsuperb were Eye of the Lens and On the\nBeach.\nPeter Rodgers\nThat's what I thought, too, but don't let\nthe name fool you. Expecting something\nfar worse, I was subjected to a healthy\ndoes of Australian Rock'n 'Roll (very\nmuch like the English commodity). Wendy Stapleton, obviously a seasoned\nstage performer, quickly won the hearts\nof what seemed a suspiciously Australian audience. Dressed in her\n(very tight) black leotard and with her\nblonde hair she presented quite a charismatic force\u2014backed up by a very\npowerful voice. The two guitarists,\nAdrian Dessent and Joe Amenta, took\nturns with the proficient if somewhat\npredictable solos. The bassist, Noel\nBeare, stuck steadfastly to the root notes\nof the appropriate chords, with the odd\nexpedition up to the third and fifths. The\npercussionist, Steve Donald, was good\nbut arn't they all nowadays?\nThe set had the standard selection of\nfast one, Tonight, the slow one, Telling\nMe Lies, the drum solo, Make Up Your\nMind, the old single, Play the Game, the\nnew single, It Just Depends and the\nalbum plug No Control. (While on the\nsubject, the album, Dazed for Days was\nproduced by John Hudson, who also\nproduced Buck Fizz and Ultravox.)\nAbout half way through the gig all the\nlights went down and after one track in\ntorch light the rest of the evening was\nspent under harsh fluorescent strip\nlighting. It is some credit to the band that\nthey took this in their stride and played\nwell enough to get two curtain calls.\nAlthough there was nothing new in the\nmaterial they presented, it was the\npresentation that made the difference\nbetween indifference and a good evening's entertainment. They're young,\nand if they can avoi.d too many comparisons with Suzie Quatro, who knows?\nSad Among Strangers\nAsked to pen a few words on a dance band to whom he\nprovides services of a managerial nature, IC student Chris\nHendy proved to be pretty elusive. Then the epistle .arrived\nexplaining that it wasn't going to be similar to the rest of its\nilk. Not for him 'the type of crap you read in NME everyday'.\nNo, a list of testimonials from various dead giants of the\nliterary world i as impressive as the back cover of the latest\nbest-selling paperback, their validity never in question and\nabout as relevant to the music of SAD AMONG STRANGERS\nas this opening paragraph.\nAnd so what about the music of Sad Among Strangers?\nSad to say it's not so original and near to the edge of current\nmusical trends to defy description, comparison or berating.\nOn the evidence of listening to a five-track cassette the Sads\nrepertoire is restricted to standard guitar-based tight funk-prominent bass, lots of sounds like springs being uncoiled\nand strangled vocals (I 've been a zulu), whining vocals (How\ngood are you?) and best of ail voc oder is ed ones (Do the\nlurch). Lyndon provides these vocals and the other members\nare Steve (drums), Sig (keyboards), Pod (guitar) and-Reeri\n(bass).\nGuy Fawkes failed to go with a bang\u2014will the Sads do the\nsame? Since you'll probably go to the party anyway who amI to spoil the surprise?\nPeter Rodgers\nPage 81 I Friday, 4 November, 19831 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "STUDENT GRANTS\nTHE AWFUL TRUTH\nThis year student grants were increased by just 4\n% bringing\nyet another fall in student living standards. If you're wondering how you are going to make this term's money stretch\nout until Christmas then you may be interested in the\nfigures below which give you a breakdown of where the\ngovernment believes your money should be going. I have\nincluded last years figures as a comparison.\nMain Rates of Grant\nUndergraduates\nLiving away from home\nLiving at home\nMinimum Grant\nPostgraduates\nLiving away from home\nLiving at home\nThe undergraduate grant breaks down to \u00a359.29 per week in term time\nand \u00a324.55 per week in the short vacations when no element for board\nand lodging is included.\nThe postgraduate grant divides into 52 equal weekly parts of \u00a357.60\neach.\nBreakdown of Undergraduate London Grant\nThe remainder of this article relates primarily to undergraduate\nmandatory awards in London. Further information on other types of\ngrant and the grants system in general are available from Student\nServices.\n1982/3 1983/4\n\u00a31,900 \u00a31,975\n1,225 1,275\n410 410\n\u00a32,880 \u00a32,995\n1,705 1,775\nVacation\u20148 weeks\nBooks, Equipment and Materials\nTravel\nMiscellaneous\nBoard and lodgings\n1983/4\n\u00a3 196\n173\n50\n261\n680\n1295\n1975\n1. Entitlement to a mandatory\naward\nWith a few exceptions, anyone\nwho has been \"ordinarily res i dent\" in the UK for at least three\nyears before they start' their\ndegree course should be entitled\nto a mandatory aware (ie the\nlocal authority has to pay them).\nA person is considered \"ordinarily resident\" if they are living in\nthe UK voluntarily for a settled\npurpose. Many of you may be\naware of the legal battles of the\nlast few years over the meaning of\n\"ordinarily resident\" in the context of overseas students. Although there are several retrospective awards still being fought\nover, the position of new students\nhas been clarified by the addition\nof a paragraph in the regulations\nwhich clearly states that periods\nspent in the UK wholly or mainly\nfor the purpose of full-time\neducation does not count towards \"ordinary residence\".\n2. Independent Students\nUnless you are classified as an\nindependent student your grant\nwill be assessed on your parents\nFELIX WRWWWWRWMhWKWM\nincome. To be an independent\nstudent you must be either 25\nyears old or have supported\nyourself out of earnings for at\nleast three years before you start\nyour course (this can include up\nto 12 months unemployment).\nYou can not, unfortunately,\ndeclare yourself independent\nsimply because you do not wish\nyour grant to be assessed on your\nparents income; on the other\nhand neither can you force your\nparents to pay their contribution\nto your grant if they choose not\nto. This unfair situation leaves\nthousands of students, who in all\nother aspects are considered by\nthe state to be independent\nadults, highly dependent on their\nparents throughout their degrees.\n3. Minimum Grant\nAll students entitled to awards\nhave their fees paid by the\nappropriate local education\nauthority and receive some contribution towards their main-ten ance. The minimum grant is\nthe amount received by students\nwhose parents earn over \u00a322,260\nand is also the' amount you will\nreceive if your parents refuse to\nsign your grant forms. For the\nsecond year the minimum grant\nremains at \u00a3410.\n4. The Means Test\nUndergraduate grants are means-tested against parental, spouses\nand students income leaving very\nfew students collecting full grants\nfrom their education authorities.\nResidual income equals gross\nincome for the financial year\npreceeding the start of the\nacademic year in question less\ncertain deductions:\na) Dependents (other than spouse\nor children) \u00a3915\nb) Domestic assistance in certain\ncircumstances \u00a3730\nc) Parent who holds a statutory\naward \u00a3375\nd) Life insurance and super an nu ation up to a maximum of 15%\ne) Interest for which tax relief is\ngiven under Income Tax Acts\n(mainly Mortgage and Home\nLoans)\nWhere there are two or more\naward holders a deduction of\n\u00a3210 for each additional holder\nwill be made from the contribution which will be apportioned\nbetween the award holders.\nNo allowance against gross\nincome will be made for other\ndependent children; instead for\neach other child dependent on the\nparent a deduction of \u00a375 will be\nmade from the assessed contribution. Parental Contribution\nThe parental contribution begins\nat \u00a320 for a residual income of\n\u00a37,100 and continues at the rate\nof \u00a31 contribution per \u00a37 residual\nincome up to \u00a39,000, then at \u00a31\nup to \u00a314,300 and at \u00a31 in \u00a313\nfrom there on. The minimum\ngrant comes into effect at a residual income of \u00a322,260.\nSpouses Contribution\nThis scale begins with a contribution of \u00a310 on a residual\nincome of \u00a35,500 and continues\nat a rate of \u00a31 in \u00a35 up to \u00a39,000\nand \u00a31 in \u00a310 from there on.\nStudents Own Income\nAny student who has an income\nof over \u00a3375 per annum during\nterm time (vacation earnings\ndon't count) will be expected to\ncontribute to their own grant.\nAny additional income above\n\u00a3375 is deducted \u00a31 per \u00a31 from\nthe grant. However there is a special disregard of \u00a3540 for\nscholarships and \u00a3795 for National Engineering Scholars.\n5. Travel\n\u00a350 is included in the grant for\ntravel. You are entitled to claim\nanything above this that you have\nto spend on daily travel in to\nCollege and on three return\njourneys per year to your parent-tal home. However, some authorities impose restrictions on the\nreimbursement of travel costs.\nStudent Services can advise you\nof these.\nThe student grants system is\ncomplex and confusing and this\ncan only be a brief introduction\nto some of the elements it.\nincludes. Extra cash is available\nfor dependents, vacation study\nand older students (amongst\nothers), so if you want to check\nthat you are getting all that you\nare entitled to, call into Student\nServices. We can also help with\nthe perennial problem of chasing\nup reticent authorities over late\ngrant cheques.\nAcknowledgements\nGrant figures provided by the\nNational Union of Students and\nDepartment of Education and\nScience.\nKaren Stott\nHow to make sure you\nFriday, 4 November, 1983 HH BH H HH get your parental contribution.\nHHBBBBBHMraSHHI Page 7\n\n"
