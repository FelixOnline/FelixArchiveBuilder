    "content": "Brixton s Bazaar\nIan Hodge investigates the beautiful south\nDeep in the stagnant swamp that is South\nLondon is a market where you can buy\nmany weird and wonderful things. If your\nidea of tasty is sheep's feet or pig's tails\nthen you're in luck.\nBrixton market, sandwiched between\nthe tube and mainline stations, is the\nresult of various ethnic and religious\ncommunities that live in close proximity.\nAfro-Caribbean, African, South East Asian,\nFar East and English cultures all add\nflavour to the soup.\nLining both sides of Electric Avenue\n(the same one mentioned in the Eddy\nGrant song) are c fruit and vegetable,\nsecond-hand shoe and even Bible stalls.\nIn addition to the normal King Williams\npears and Cox's apples you can buy puna\nyams (a large relative of the potato),\nokra, g in eps, juna plums, green bananas\nand plantain (longer than usual bananas.)\nThe permanent shops that are collected\naround a bend in the road are a mixture\nof butchers, grocers and clothes shops.\nLooking into the butchers is definitely not\nfor the squeamish or faint-hearted, whole\ncows are cut up with rotary saws with\nlittle thought for any passing vegetarians.\nAny part of the cow can be bought, from\nits tail to its neck and everything in\nbetween.\nYou can even buy something that I remember from dissection lessons at\nschool: pig's trotters. If you fancy trying\nthem you can get four for less than a pound, but there's not much meat on\nthem.\nIf you continue along Electric Avenue,\ncross over Atlantic Road and pass under\nthe railway bridge you come into Pope's Road.\nHere you will find more fruit and ve g stalls, a knickers stall and one selling\nJamaican sherry. You can even buy\npieces of wood in little plastic bags for a pound. I have no idea what they are for,\nif you buy some let me know.\nContinuing on you come to a crossroads with Brixton Station Road, the\nBrixton Recreation Centre is in front and\nto the left. Looking left you will see a stall selling eggs and further along a couple of stalls selling second-hand\nrecords. They sell every kind of music\nbut one of them does concentrate on\nmore obscure artists.\nIf you turn right you come to the area\nof second hand clothes and general junk\nstalls. These aren't in full swing until at\nleast an hour after the main market.\nThere is a good chance of picking up a suit for around ten pounds but most of\nthe clothes would look more at home in a seventy's drama.\nRetracing your steps, half way along\nPope's Road you will see the entrance to\nthe Granville Arcade on your left. This\ncontains two of the strangest shops in the\narea.\nFirstly the wig shop. Here you can get\nan afro-wig which the Four Tops would\nbe proud of, so you too can look like a fuzz ball on legs. Inside you can get hair\nextensions in red, green, yellow and even\nbrown, clip-on pony-tails and hair dye in\nevery colour under the sun.\nFurther along 1st Avenue (the street\nand numbered, 1st to 5th) is a shop called\n'Food from home'. This sells Indian Asian\nfood, spices, vegetables and dried fish.\nThe fish comes both whole and in\npowders sold by the quarter.\nOther shops in the arcade include a pet\nshop, several butchers and fishmongers,\nclothes shops and a bakers.\nIf you come out onto Atlantic Road by\nturning down an alley with a baker and a butcher on opposite sides you will come\nout almost opposite Market Row.\nThis is a very similar to Granville\nArcade, concentrating more on clothes\nand general household goods. This was\nthe only place I could find which sold\npigs tails, three in a bag for about fifty\npence.\nOther areas to look at are the railway\narches, where you may hear some gospel\nsinging, the area immediately behind the\ntube station and also some of the side\nstreets off Electric Avenue.\nIf you fancy something to eat there are\na few cafes dotted about such as Joe's Cafe along Brixton Station Road. It is\nreasonably priced and reasonably clean.\nGetting to Brixton is easy, either take\nthe Victoria line south or a British Rail\ntrain both to Brixton Station.\nStalls are set up by around half past\nnine along Electric Avenue and slighly\nlater along Brixton Station Road.\nThe area is definitely worth a look\nalthough I was slighly disappointed with\nthe lack of atmosphere for which the\narea is supposedly famous.\n12\n\n"

    "content": "Do You Know This Man?\nCut Up\nBolt cutters were used to break through a padlock that secured a locker last\nWednesday afternoon. The locker, on\nLevel 1 in the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment, contained a cheque book,\ncheque card, watch and a diary.\nEarlier that afternoon a Chinese student\nhad borrowed a set of bolt cutters from\nthe stores in the basement of the\nbuilding. The cutters were issued from\nthe stores without a request for\nidentification and without a signature\nbeing obtained. Realising that bolt cutters,\nor similar equipment, must have been the\nmethod of entry, Neil Steer, the owner of\nthe stolen items, tried to borrow some\nand was able to get them out without\ngetting questioned.\nSecurity tried matching the cut marks\non the padlock with those of the cutters\nfound in the posse sion of cycle thieves\nlast week, but this proved negative. Terry\nBriley, College Security Officer, said that\nthey are very interested in talking to the\nstudent who borrowed the bolt cutters on\nWednesday afternoon.\nVideo cameras caught the man pictured\nabove after he attempted to cash a stolen\ncheque in the South Kensington branch of\nThomas Cook.\nThe cheque book and card had been\nstolen earlier that morning, on the 9th October, from Dr. Nicholson of the\nChemistry Department. Dr. Nicholson told\nFELIX that he had seen the photographs\nbut did not recognise the man involved.\nHe said that the cheque book had been\ntaken from his briefcase and that other\nitems such as credit cards, driving licence\nand a billfold containing some money had\nbeen taken from his jacket. These were\nnot discovered to be missing until six that\nevening.\nDr. Nicholson warned that there had\nbeen a number of other thefts from the\nupper floors of Chemistry and Physics\nand added that his office was 'out of the\nway' on the eighth floor. He said that\nanybody seen wandering about was\nusually assumed to be lost and would be\nstopped. At the time of the theft, Dr.\nNicholson was teaching and the two\nresearch students normally resident in his\noffice had left for the library.\nID Checks Justified Rag Raid\nThe recent identity checks in Southside\nbar have been justified by Mr Roger\nPownall, Bars Manager, as they 'protect\nstudents'.\nHe said that 'there are a lot of people\nwho should not be in the bar and we\nmust comply with the licensing laws'. He\nstressed that Southside bar was not a student bar but one for all people with a connection with the college.\nHe added that the most of the trouble\nmakers in the bar were people outside\nthe college, and that no-one was asked to\nleave last week but this might become a possibility. He said that members of the\ncollege are requested to carry\nidentification at all times - students should\ncarry their Union cards.\nMr Pownall said that they might\nconsider issue ing identity cards or badges\nto Bar staff so that the challenged\ncustomers know why they are being\nasked to provide identity.\nRCS Election\nSuzanne Ahmet has been elected as the\npresident of the Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU). She won by two votes, the\nresults being 106 votes for her, 104 for\nJames Bryant, 13 abstentions and 20\nspoilt papers.\nThere had been some controversy\nsurrounding her eligibility to stand for the\nposition since she had not registered on a course when the elections took place.\nThis was due to a delay in college\nadministration which was later deemed\nnot to affect the election.\nAlthough Suzanne will be studying\nMaterials she has studied Physics for two\nyears and is thus a full member of RCSU.\nChas Randies, last year's VP for the\nRCSU, said 'It's nice to have a president'.\nWhen she received the president's gown, Suzanne said 'I..' and fainted.\nThe Rag raid to Guildford on Wednesday\nraised a total of \u00a3185.03. The largest\namount, \u00a357, was raised by Pete Bowen.\nThis Saturday there will be a collection in\nCovent Garden for the World Wildlife\nFund.\nImperial College\nFriends of Palestine Society\nwould like to invite you to\na lecture entitled:\nTHE U.N.

    "content": "Sports Football:\nIC II, ULU division 1 defending\nchampions, got a very rude awakening at\nthe start of the 90/91 campaign, crashing\nlike an IC house party 6-0 to London\nHospitals.\nWhy? Lack of fitness and entirely new\nteam sound better reasons than 'we were\ncrap!'.\nThe next game, against Royal Free\nHospital, saw a distinct and welcome\nimprovement. Despite domination most of\nthe match, a goal by S Barry, a double\npenalty save by S Shilling and some\nbizarre refereeing meant the match ended\nin a diplomatic 1-1 draw.\nAnd so to victory....IC II, with improved\nfitness and teamwork, completely\noutclassed (and out scored) the School of\nPharmacy team to earn their first league\nwin, two points and captains jug! IC\ndominated from the start with M Abdo\nscoring a classy solo goal in the seventh\nminute. A shock equalise r two minutes\nlater stemmed the IC tide until the\nfifteenth minute when M Plummer scored\ndirectly from a corner kick. Ten minutes\nlater S Barry turned on a new 5p piece to\ncrack in the third. IC started the second\nhalf in a relaxed mood and allowed SOP\nback into the game. A nervous and\ntesting time ended shortly before full time\nas M Abdo blasted his second of the\nafternoon to make it 4-2 to IC.\nDribblers\nThe IC Dribblers, long regarded as the\nlast hope of decent football at IC, cruised\nto a70 victory at Goldsmith's on Sunday\nOctober 14, with a performance to put\nthe men's teams to shame.\nThe Holbein trio, Permi, Gert and Eth\nbulldozed their way through a rock solid\ndefence with amazing runs up the length\nof the pitch to leave the Goldsmiths side\nawestruck with their skill.\nPermi put on a fine performance,\nscoring four goals after basically coming\nback from the dead a fj ter an horrendous\nfoul by a Goldsmith's defender. But foul\nplay and dirty tactics didn't deter the\nDribblers as they romped home to a storming 7-0 victory. The Holbein trio,\nthe backbone of the squad, the inspiration\nbehind the team, were supported\ntremendously by the rest of the team,\nparticularly the other scorers: Debbie, Jo\nand Nat.\nThis fine performance has no doubt\nserved as a grave warning to the other\nleague teams\u2014the Dribblers are back\nwith a vengeance, and with the exciting\nprospect of further Holbeiners joining the\nsquad, the other teams are no doubt\nshaking in their boots.\nWhat a splendid performance!\nIC IV-2 IC V0 What better way to start the season than\nto have this needle match to whet the\nappetite. With both sides still getting to\nknow each other so early in the season,\nthe first half began tensely, although the\n4th s had the majority of the chances.\nCaptain Shangha missed an easy chance\nearly on and then had an even easier\nchance cleared off the line. Not put off by\ntheir Captain's apparent mental\ndisabilities, the 4th s soldiered on against\nsome skilful play from the opposition and\nKeven McCann managed to hit the post.\nThe deadlock continued for half an\nhour after the interval, then the 4th s brought on their sub, Damon Thomas. He\nimmediately made a brilliant run into the\nopen left and then immediately and\nbrilliantly bugger ed it up. This sub was\nthen involved in an ugly incident at the\nother end as the 5th s foul-mouthed and\nlumbering captain mali cu lou sly bundled\nhim off the ball, but luckily the referee\nwas close at hand and no serious injury\nensued.\nThen, with 10 minutes left, the 4th s broke down the right and midfielder Rich\nBurrows slid the ball in for the deserved\nlead. Finally, close to the end and with\nthe 5th s pressing for an equalise r, the\n4th s counter-attacked and the versatile\nLee Davis finished superbly to make sure\nof the result.\nDebbie Williams\n\u2014A Tribute\nDebbie Williams, the figurehead of the IC\nDribblers, made what was probably the\ntoughest decision of her life on Sunday\nOctober 14 when she decided to step\ndown and hand over captaincy to\nPermi\u2014a member of the famous Holbein\nschool of football. Debbie fought back the\ntears as she played what was to be her\nlast game as Captain.\nBut what a performance she put on for\nher fans with a splendid first half goal\nlaid on by her successor.\nDebbie was the original founder of the\nfamous Dribblers and, along with super\ncoach, and inspiration behind the team,\nWillie John, has shaped the Dribblers into\nworld beaters.\nShe put on a brave face as she led her\nteam into Southside for the final time and\nmade it a night to remember as she got\ncompletely pissed, and embarrassed all\nand sundry.\nDebbie Williams\u2014what a star, we stand\nup and applaud you!\nCross\nCountry\nSo, was October 13 to see a new dawn in\nthe blighted recent history of IC Xcountry? Eight fit, young Corinthians\nthought so, and on a sunny day in early\nFall they travelled to Oxford for the\nseason's traditional curtain raise r, the\nOxpoly Relays. High on hopes and\nbuoyed by a sense of history, Frank\nDudbridge blasted round the first lap of\nthe technically demanding course to\nrecord 8.57 and 4th place for the A team.\nThe B team was opened by Ian Williams,\nwho finished just behind Carl Edwards of\nthe Guardians of the Free Spirit,\nconsisting of the A runners in a different\norder. Destiny was now to rear its head\nas Paul Northrop stormed round in 8:12\nto put IC A into an awesome 150m lead.\nThe other two teams ably maintained\nposition through Duncan O 'Dellin the B and Frank performing a brave but\nultimately naive 2nd individual leg for the\nC. Stage three, and the benefits of\ntraining above the snow line were\ndemonstrated by Dave Bivvy, whose\nsturdy thighs kept the first team in the\nlead by a comfortable 57 second margin,\nwhile Paul pulled off a9:11 for the Free\nSpirit and Jake maintained the B team's inexorable progress, the anchor leg fell to\nthe hapless and woefully under trained Carl, whose commendable effort might\nhave held up against a mere mortal, but\nagainst a bronzed Adonis could only\ncapitulate. Keven Usher of Oxpoly Old\nBoys not only relegated IC to second\nplace, but also deprived Paul of the day's fastest time by just one second. Some\ncomfort was gained, however, when\nOxpoly Old Boys were not given first\nprize since the race was only open to\ncurrent students. Meanwhile Harry\nbrought the B team home in a respectable mid-field position, and the\ndistinguishing feature of the C team, a pair of Oakley sunglasses, was displayed\nby Dave, finishing ahead of many other\ncolleges' A teams. So, moral victory and\nhopefully a springboard to further team\nand individual success in the season\nahead.\nRifle & Pistol\nDuring the summer, the Imperial College\nPistol team won the Howe Cup for the\nthird consecutive year.\nLong range scores\nImperial\nSimon Taylor 103/150\nJames Hurr 103/150\nTony Menzies 79/150\n(Tim Griffiths 74/150) Reserve\nOxford\nSteve Ivory 77/150\nKate Sprake 48/150\nA.N.

    "content": "Bailey's on the Rocks \\Veaf Sir\nLETTERS\nDear Sir,\nAlan Bailey's neanderthal treatment of\nan issue as complex as sex changes\n(FELIX 879) is symptomatic of the extent\nto which tunnel-vision and intellectual\nimpotence can castrate the ability to\nrationally consider and respond to the\nimpact of unavoidable challenges to our\nsocial fabric. The ever accelerating effect\nof science and technology on our lives\nhas to be regarded with a mind set\ndevoid of any preconceived and simplistic\nideas.\nFor example, to what extent does\ngenetic engineering enter the domain of\nmedical healthcare as a 'pre-em pti ve' cure? The Alan Bailey's of the world will\nconcentrate on propagandist side issues\nlike the 'deviant' parents which choose\nthe sex of their children; ignoring, for\nexample, that genetic engineering gives\nus the chance to eliminate some\nhereditary diseases which condemn\nthousands of people to a lifetime of subnormal existence.\nOn the sex-change issue, what is the\nvalue to society of 25,000 physiologically\nmaladjusted and potentially unstable\npeople? To put down the solution to a psychological problem which these\n'revolting creatures' should face up to is a crude, totalitarian disregard for the prime\nethic of any progressive society; to\nmaximise the freedom of its individuals.\nOne of the main problems of people like\nAlan Bailey, stomping around in their\nself- righteous intellectual jackboots, is\nthat they actually believe that there are\nabsolute moral standards which can be\napplied to people: there is a 'good' and a 'bad' person, a 'deviant' and a 'weirdo'.\nWake up! Good and bad can at most\nonly be applied to the interaction\nbetween two or more people. A person\nwho has a sex change is not a 'bad'\nperson for the simple reason of having\nundergone an operation: it's the effects of\nthe operation on his interaction with\nothers that has to be judged. Has Alan Bailey ever met somebody who has had a sex change?\nThere is a simple reason for people like\nAlan Bailey to try and arrange everything\ninto little piles of 'good' and 'bad': they\nare simply not strong enough to face up\nto the fact that life is disorder, that we are not in control to the extent to which\nwe think we are. It's so easy to fall into\nthe trap of accepting what religions,\nideologies or even just plain intellectual\nsloth tells you is 'the answer': it makes\nyou feel in control. You could almost\nforgive them: spoon-fed a diet of order,\nshelter and unlimited possibilities, behind\na judeo-christian religion which arrogantly\nsupposes to have an answer for\neverything and a self-sustaining economic\nenvironment based on the maxim gun\n(...), the chaos and turbulence that 90% of\nthe world's population have to cope\nwith\u2014reality, damm it! \u2014on a daily basis\nare easily hidden.\nBut you can't: we can't afford to\ncondone narrow-mindedness. We need\nresponsible, creative people who will\nwork out new paradigms for the way our\nsociety should evolve, not primitive,\nstagnant, jingoistic closet fascists.\nKonrad Pagenstert, Mech Eng 3.\nBrendan).\n\u2022 THE YOGA CLASS will hold its first meeting\non Monday October 29 at 7.30am in the Union\nGym.

    "content": "FEATURE\nA tour round Eastern Turkey.\nIn Search of No\nThis year, western holidaymakers will\nonce again cram themselves onto the\n'developed' beach resorts of Turkey's Aegean and Mediterranean coasts,\noblivious to the rest of the nation. The\nlong narrow country would stretch from\nthe Baltic Sea to Barcelona, or from\nMaidenhead to Morocco. Despite this,\nmost of the tourists who visited in 1989\nwere happily unaware that life existed\noutside Bodrum. Content with the hotel\npool and bar, many do not know how\neasy, cheap and rewarding Turkish travel\nis.\nTurkey, the gateway to Asia, has an\nenviable public transport system. The vast\nbustling bus depots in each town act as a central nervous system to the extensive\ncoach service. Timetables depend on\ndemand, with buses constantly leaving\n'Now' to anywhere. With up to twenty\ncoach companies touting for business at\nthe depots, the cheapest fares can be\nbartered within minutes. Costs of bus\ntravel averages out at about 30p per 100\nmiles. Hotel and pension prices away\nfrom the coast can be less than \u00a32 per\nnight including breakfast. This makes a few weeks of travel through Turkey\nsubstantially cheaper than a single resort\npackage beach holiday.\nWe flew into Istanbul on a cheap flight\nin late August. Planning to see this\nancient city on our return three weeks\nlater, we immediately took an eight hour\nbus journey east to Ankara, the capital.\nThis wasn't as horrific as it sounds. The\nfrequent stops and gallons of free tea\nserved in tall glasses by small boys with\ncrew cuts eased the monotony. Attracted\nby the call from Cappadocia, we left\nAnkara early the next day for the central\nAnatolina plains. The region is famous for\nits soft volcanic rocks which have been\nextensively hollowed out for homes and\nstables. Some of these are still lived in\ntoday. In Goreme it is possible to stay in\nthe cave hotels and pensions. A dusk\nstroll up to the cave dwellings above the\nsmall town of Urgup tempts out the cave\npeople who offer impromptu candle-lit\nguided tours round the dingy passages of\ntheir ancestors and invite you to share\nfruit in their humble homes.\nFrom the biblical landscapes of central\nTurkey our pilgrimage took us east\nthrough earthquake-plagued Erzurum and\non to Dogubayazit. At only 35 km from\nthe Iranian frontier this was the most\neasterly point of our travels. It is a town\nof butchers and the streets reek of raw\nmeat. Skinned car cases swathed in clouds\nof flies hang outside the shop windows.\nDogubeyazit is dominated by the\nlegendary 5,165m Mt. Ararat. The snowy\npeak, supposedly the resting place of\nNoah's Ark breached the horizon an hour\nbefore the town was reached. It can be\nclimbed and there seems to be an\nin exhaust able supply of guides and\nsherpa s who are prepared to lead you\nup\u2014'If you have permission'. This comes\nin written form from the authorities in\nAnkara and can take several months to\nobtain. There is nothing technically\ndifficult about the climb. The danger\ncomes from the severe weather, ferocious\nsheep dogs, smugglers and outlaws. These\nproblems can be overcome by joining a group tour. Hann Overland adventure\ntravel offer an 11 day Mount Ararat Trek\nfrom the UK for \u00a3580.\nThe numbers of people climbing the\nmountain are on the increase. In 1982\nJames Irwin the American astronaut\nreached the summit. His Kurdish guide\nnow runs a taxi company near the bus\nstation in Dogubeyazit. He told me that\nhe has climbed Ararat six times since\nthen but has never found any remains of\nthe Ark. Over the years several people\nhave reported sighting a 'boat shape', but\nnone have bought back any conclusive\nevidence.\nFor a few pounds, a small Dogubeyazit\ntour company offers the 'Ark Tour'. The\nproprietor studied English in Sheffield. His\nitinerary promises visits to Isak Pasa\nPalace, a Kurdish village, Noah's Ark\nremains, the Iranian border, a meteorite\ncrater and an ice cave at the base of Mt.\nArarat.\nThe next morning all the budding\n'Raiders of the Lost Ark' assembled\noutside the travel office to board the\nminibus. The battered bus which looked\nh's Ark FEATURE\nas if Noah was the first owner, headed\nEast out of the city, the engine revving at\nits limit as we climbed the steep cliffs.\nIsak Pasa Palace was the first stop after\ntwenty minutes. The building was started\nin 1685 and took 99 years to complete.\nDespite the Russian invasion which\ndesecrated it in 1917 the ruins are still\nbreathtaking, with the Seljuk, Ottoman,\nGeorgian, Persian and Armenian\narchitecture still intact and competing\nagainst the arid ochre landscape of\nvolcanic soils. Behind the palace sits a mosque from 1512 which is still used for\nprayer. Behind this, rising out of the cliffs\nare the 800BC walls of the old city.\nThe thirty minute ration allowed to\nview the palace was barely enough.\nEveryone sat in the bus waiting for me as\nI scrambled frantically around the ruins\nexploring every room on each level.\nFinally the guide had to come and extract\nme himself!\nSufficiently recovered, the bus dragged\nus over the next ridge to descend into a green valley. The screaming engine\nechoed around the hills beckoning little\nKurdish shepherd children and massive\nsheep dogs from the fields. They scurried\nto the roadside like iron filings to a magnet. The dogs were like horses and\nstood barking in the road ready to headbutt the bus as we passed. The children\nthrew sticks, the dogs bit the tyres and\nwe prayed not to break down as the bus\nspluttered past. Two small villages later\nthe driver felt it was safe to stop. The\ndogs were gone but the children were\nstill there, snapping our ankles with cries\nof 'photo...photo'. One carried a rams\nskull which he brandished on his\nforehead like some Greek beast.\nThe village men would not talk to us,\nand argued over the repair of a tractor.\nThe house-proud women tempted us into\na home. The small white dung and mud\nwalled building was neatly carpeted, the\nwalls had flock wallpaper and the ceiling\nhad polystyrene tiles. A stereo sat on a table and a redundant television squatted\nin the corner awaiting the arrival of\nelectricity. Our guide was impatient to\nhurry on. I had already messed up his\nschedule once.\nThe descent continued until we reached\nan area of cleared ground and a newly\nbuilt restaurant complex overlooking the\n'Noah's Ark remains'. The 'boat hull'\nresembling the remains of the Marie Rose\nlay about 300 metres away across a dry\nriver bed. It was clearly only meant to be\nviewed at a distance. Determined to get\nmy value for money I scrambled down\nthe steep bank and dashed over the\nhummock y ground to examine the\nremains. I had only a few minutes before\nthe bus horn called me back. I returned\nbreathless to the group who applauded as\nI passed a small piece of petrified wood\naround. Whether from boat or tree was\nfor them to decide.\nOur lunch stop was the corner shop at\nthe Iranian border. Biscuits and bubble\ngum were on the menu. These we\nchewed as the bus bounced North along\nthe border to the 'meteorite crater. The\nunimpressive cavity strongly resembled a small World War Two bomb crater,\nalthough the sign boasted its vital\nstatistics and preached in confusing\nEnglish that 'the hole of meteor is the\nsecond crater in\nthe world except\n(that) another one\nwhich is in\nAlaska'.\nThe final venue\ninvolved a strenuous drive\nacross virgin lava\nflows to reach the\nice cave. A short\nwalk took us\nfrom the\nexhausting heat\nof the afternoon\ninto the icy drafts\nfrom a low wide\nhole. Descending into the chilled air we\nmet crowds of Kurdish women\nbrandishing head-sized chunks of clear ice\nin their numbed hands. They filled canvas\nshopping bags to carry the perishable\njewels home. We gave some of them a lift the four kilometres back to their\nvillage. They sat in over-awed silence, the\nmelting ice oozing from their bags and\npooling on the dusty bus floor.\nWe swapped buses in Dogubuyazit for\nthe four hour trip to Van. It sits on the\nsouth-eastern shores of the vast Lake\nVan, Turkey's 'Dead Sea', a mass of\nbuoyant alkaline water the size of Greater\nLondon. The lake is famous for the\nArmenian churches which can be found\non the many small islands.\nTime was against us and Van was our\nlast taste of the East before we dashed\nback to the West. Covering 1,500\nkilometres and passing through several\ncenturies we reached Antalya feeling that\nwe had discovered a world poorly\nrepresented in expensive whitewashed\ncarpet shops and chip and burger bars of\nBodrum.\nChristopher Riley\nWORLD LEADERS\nIN\nSTUDENT TRAVEL\nLow cost flights\non quality airlines\nSpecial fares for\nstudents\nWeekend breaks,\ntours & group\nbookings\nWell travelled\nconsultants to\nguide you\nOver 120 offices worldwide\nUL U TRAVELS HER FIELD BUILDING IMPERIAL COLLEGE99209 ULU TRAVEL\n\n"

    "content": "ets y's Wedding\nThis film can best be described as a good\nattempt at staged havoc, with everything\nthat can go wrong doing so and finally\nending up with everybody living happily\never after. The ending's the same, the\nrest of the film is a bit of disappointment.\nWritten by, and staring, Alan Alda\n(Hawkeye from M*A*S*H) who plays\nBetsy's father Eddie Hopper, things start\nwith a lot of promise. The acting is fine\nwith Stevie Dee (Anthony LaPaglia)\nplaying the part of a silk tongued\ngangster particularly well. Unfortunately\nthe humour is a little contrived although\nwhen the af for mentioned Stevie Dee tries,\nwith the utmost respect, to ask Eddie's older daughter out for dinner things do\npick up greatly. She is, after all, a police\nofficer!\nAnother problem is that the main\ntheme is lost amongst the myriad of sub-plots. This means it is very hard to get\ninvolved with the problems that the\nyoung couple encounter, the conflicting\nwishes of both sets of parents over\nhave.\nNot a bad film, certainly reasonably\nmore life to create the result I think they\nwere after.\nIan Hodge.\neverything, down to what sort of nut to good entertainment but it needed a little\nA Shock to the System\nEveryone wants to kill someone\nsometime, don't they? Now, imagine you\nhave an annoying, nagging wife. Imagine\nan obnoxious yuppie has just been\npromoted over your head, and is\nstripping you of your power. Imagine\nyou've just pushed a tramp under a subway train, and got away with it...\nThis is the position Graham Marshall\n(Michael Caine, soon to be seen with\nRoger Moore in Bullseye - not a lot of\npeople know that) finds himself in not\nlong after receiving an electric shock (to\nthe system?). It occurs to him that a couple of convenient accidents might\nmake his life a lot simpler. Soon he takes\nupon himself the role of wizard, fixing all\nthat lies in his way. He even takes on a young, attractive and female (ie sexy,\navailable and not to bothered about grey\nhair and wrinkles) apprentice who slowly\nbegins to suspect that all is not as it\nseems.\nA sinister tale of office and (basic)\nsexual politics. A classy thriller. Michael\nCaine looking more evil than I have ever\nseen him before. The plot is not complex,\nbut it has a certain relentlessness to it\nthat keeps one enthralled. The excellent\nplaying by the whole cast helps lift it\nfrom the dangerous abyss of TV movie dom. As the end draws nigh, the cop draws\nnear and the girlfriend draws a lighter\nout of an envelope, the audience are on\nthe edge of their proverbial seats. The\nending is good, satisfactory, chilling and\nun revealed here. The film is good,\nexciting, chilling and recommended here.\nAdam T. Mo' Better Blues\nMo Better Blues is Spike Lee's fourth\nfeature film and like his other 'Joints' the\nbasis remains in the portrayal of AfroA meri can culture in modern American\nsociety. Whereas in his previous and most\nwidely acclaimed film Do The Right\nThing Lee focused on racial tensions, in\nBrooklyn Mo Better Blues returns to the\nscenario of relationships as in his first film\nShe's Gotta Have It.\nThe thematic principles are the same,\nbut the backdrop to this film is neither\nracial is m, rivalry or sexual indecision but\njazz. This is not the jazz of Eastwood's Bird or Round Midnight. This is not the\nsleepy 50s nightclubs where the talent of\nthe players concerned (Charlie Parker and\nBud Powell respectively) is shrouded in a haze of drugs and alcohol, in which the\ngenius of the musicians plays second\nsaxophone to the sadness and ultimate\ntragedy of their personal lives. No this is\na hip, stylised jazz where the only thing\nshrouding the players' virtuosity is the cut\nof their suits.\nThe film is centred around Bleak\nGilliam (played superbly by Denzel\nWashington), a self-centred, intense jazz\ntrumpet player. A rising star whose\negotism and misplaced confidence in the\ncontrol and dominance of people in his\nlife (namely his band, his lovers and\nmanager) contrive to be his downfall and\nsaviour.\nThe musical score is excellent,\ncomposed by Lee's father Bill, himself an\naccomplished jazz bassist (who has a cameo role as Indigo's father) and played\nby the Branford Marsalis Quartet, friends\nof Lee whose brother Wynton Marsalis is\na talented trumpet player.\nMo Better Blues has all the hallmarks of\na Lee film, the fast witty dialogue,\ncharacters centre screen addressing the\ncamera directly, the unusual camera\nangles, and because this time Lee had\nmoney to play with (he is a sound\ninvestment, assured to rake large returns\nat the box office) there is a lush feel and\nvisual quality about the film afforded by\nfine set designs and subtle lighting.\nWith Mo Better Blues Spike Lee extends\nhis reputation as being one of the most\nimportant contemporary film makers and\nis indeed a love supreme. (Try to avoid\nseeing Mo Better Blues at a Cannon\ncinema as they don't give a student\ndiscount even at the first showing.)\nJimmy Rimmer.\n6\n\n"

They covered a wide\nspectrum of topics from political to\nscience fiction tendencies. Unfortunately,\nover the summer, three societies have\nrapidly diminished and I am now putting\nout an appeal for potential committee\nmembers to step forward, and revive\nthese flagging dominions. Of course,\nfunding is available as last year's committees had already put a claim in.\nThe societies are:\nGreater London Club\u2014organises events to\npromote London.\nThird World First\u2014Concerned with the\ndeveloping world.\nWomen in Science and Technology\u201420%\nof the college's population trying to do\nthe other 80%'s work.\nIf you are interested, please get in touch\nvia ICU.\nSpenser Lane (SCC Chair).\nRock Soc\nreview\nSolid State kicked off to a good start with\nsome weird noises, and soon fell into a selection that wavered across the\nboundaries of rock n roll and rhythm and\nblues, with heavy metal solos. Twenty to\ntwenty-five years ago this would have\nseemed exciting.

Since their excellent performance\nhere last year, they have shed almost all\ntraces of glam and even got thrash y in\nthe ultra-heavy I'm a Man, which was one\nof the few tracks that wasn't played at\nbreakneck speed. They did lighten up\noccasionally to give people a chance to\nboogie, so there was something for\neveryone. They played both songs from\ntheir single Easy Days Sleazy Nights. The\nB side, Crazy was a superb, heavy blaze\nof speed and power. At only SI (plus \u00a32\nRockSoc membership) this was really\ngood value for money.

They employ both\nmental and physical agility, as well as\ntactics and guile.\nThe history of fencing is long and\nchequered, sometimes popular, at one\ntime illegal. The masters of the sixteenth\nand seventeenth century would teach\ntheir deadly techniques to all classes of\nperson, from common brawlers to\nroyalty.\nMuch of fencing's mystique comes from\nreal or fictional characters. The infamous\nJulie de Maupin, who is reputed to have\nkilled several men in a series of duels at\na ball; simply because they had defended\na woman she had insulted. Cyrano de\nBergerac, who would challenge people to\nduels for just looking at his unfortunately\nlong nose.\nThe image that springs to mind is\ninvariably of Errol Flynn, swinging from\nchand ali ers or fighting eight men at once.\nHowever, the reality of fencing is far\nmore beautiful than these spectacular,\nstraightforward images. A great fencer's skills are subtle: blinding speed,\njudgement of timing and distance, the\nability to be utterly unpredictable.\nAll of these things are difficult to see\nand impossible to understand unless you\nconfront such a person with an e pee, foil\nor sabre in your hand.\nThe fencing club at IC has fencers of all\nabilities, from beginner to advanced. Our\ncoach is Ziemeck Wojciechowski, the\nNational coach for foil and Olympic\ncoach. We compete in the National\nUniversity Athletics Union tournament\nwhich we won last year. No beginning\nequipment is needed other than trainers,\ntrack suit trousers and enthusiasm.\nAs fencers, you would be encouraged\nto train, fight, win and lose as sports men\nand women, to develop your own\ntechnique and to enjoy this exhilarating\nsport. If you're interested, why not come\nalong and become the butcher of nothing\nmore than a silk button?\nOn Monday October 22 in the first game\nof the year, the IC squad won through a very physical encounter with Enfield to\nwin 6-4. It was a fine team performance\nwith everyone swimming hard, an\nencouraging sign with the UAU\nchampionships approaching.\nBeginning this evening (Friday 27)\nexpert coaching will be given by a Great\nBritain player, which will raise the level\nof our play, and set us up for an exciting\nand successful year. In Monday's game\nour early term fitness improved to be the\ndecisive factor, showing that there is still\nplenty of room for any potential players\nprepared to train hard. So, all who\nexpressed an interest, now is the time to\ncome down to training every Monday and\nFriday from 6.00pm. There is also a women's water polo squad which was\nparticularly successful last year, and\nwhich needs new players. Again come\ntraining on Monday or Friday for further\ndetails.\nSailing\nOn Sunday October 14, the racing section\nof the Yacht Club took part in the first of\neight races in the First Class Europe\nWinter Series. The crew, Tony\nRazmilovic, Thor Askerland, Emmanuel\nOsmont, Andre Coppola, Emmanuel\nGringarten, Rick Dickinson, Rory Barrett\nand Tim Parons, practised hard on the\nSaturday to build up their confidence with\ngybes and tacks, and gaining the feel of\nthe boat.\nRace day on Sunday started slowly with\nsome sleepy heads taking too long to\nready themselves but even though the\nboat was one minute late for the start,\nand in spite of not having a pen to write\ndown and plan the course and tactics,\nNot Us forged onwards, with sails full and\nropes cracking. Two and a half laps later,\nwe rounded for the final tack to the finish\nalongside arch-rivals Yes and just gently\npulled away, to turn in a respectable\nfourth place (to be confirmed).\nNext race: This Sunday (21st).

    "content": "Union Gig Stage dives Last Saturday's disco lost the Union an\nestimated \u00a35500 due to a poor turnout. It\nwas originally intended that the gig was\nto be held in the Careers Fair marquee\nrather than the Concert hall and was\nintended to cover the loss expected of\nthe Fair. Murray Williamson, Union Hon\nSec, said 'In the end we wouldn't have\nhad to stage the event anyway as the\nCareers Fair made a profit'. He added\nthat the event seemed 'quite a wacky\nidea'.\nMurray Williamson said that the event\nhad been proposed by David Ensell, the\nCareers Fair Manager, and Rob Northey,\nRefectories manager, at the end of\nAugust. He said that David had assured\nhim that the marquee was available for\ntwo weeks and added that Mr Northey\nhad agreed to the project going ahead.\nMr Northey had requested an early\napplication for a bar extension but this\nwas not produced by Murray until two\nweeks before the event was due. He was\nthen informed by refectories that the\nMain Dining Hall had already been\nbooked for another event and so was not\navailable to house a bar.\nAt this point the PA system had been\nordered as well as the bands, the stage\nand the lighting. Murray said that to\ncancel the event would have cost \u00a34000\nbut 'to go ahead would piss off Northey'.\nA decision on the event was postponed\nuntil Wednesday lunchtime, a week and a half before the gig. This was, in Murray's words 'a day and a half wasted'.\nIn the meantime the support band Nine\nBelow Zero had gone down badly at\nMiddlesex Polytechnic and had walked off\nstage early. They are currently being\nsued by Mandy Hurford, their General\nManager. She will become Imperial\nCollege Union Manager on the 6th November.\nAlthough the contracts with both bands\nwere verbal, Dr. And the Medics had sent\na contract to be signed whereas Nine\nBelow Zero had not. The support band\ntherefore have no obligation to the Union\nwho cannot sue.\nPublicity for the gig was produced only\nfive days before the event reading 'plus\nsupport band'. A new support band, the\nPhantom Chords, had been found by this\ntime and so stickers advertising the new\nband had to be affixed. When this was\nattempted on the Wednesday before the\ngig, it was found by Murray that not\nmany posters had been put up around\ncollege although Ents had put up posters\nin other London colleges. The new\nstickers advertised a drop in price from\n\u00a37 to \u00a35. This was still calculated to\ncover costs.\nMurray Williamson said that flyers were\nhanded out at the ULU all night er and\ninside college throughout the rest of the\nweek. Before the event, however, only\n150 tickets had been sold and so the\nprice was reduced to \u00a32 on the door. This\nwas not advertised widely.\nAt the event, ticket inspection was\nhampered by the fact that access to the\nmain toilets was required due to the\nUnion Bar's toilets being broken. Tickets\nhad to be collected on the staircase which\nmeant that many of the 350 people who\nfinally attended got in free.\nMurray Williamson said that the money\nlost will come from Union funds rather\nthan from Ents. He added that the exact\nsource of the money will be discussed at\nthe next Union Finance Committee (UFC).\nHe also said that to stage the event in\nthe marquee would have required extra\nemergency lighting and fire doors as the\nmarquee was 'effectively pretty unsafe'.\nHe stressed that since Mr Northey had\ngiven him permission to stage the event\nhe had assumed that higher management\nhad been informed. He said 'It's not our\nfault it didn't go all the way to the top'\nand 'It wasn't our communications that\nbroke down'.\nSecurity\nWorries\nMr Geoff Reeves, Chief security officer\nat IC, warned of a walk- in thief who has\nbeen seen in the Chemistry building. He\nis described as having a black leather\njacket with blue jeans and about 5' 8\"\ntall. He had grey hair and was probably\nabout 40 years old.\nThe cycle D locks on sale from the\nSecurity office now cost \u00a320.50. Mr\nReeves said that he could no longer\nmanage to keep the price down, though\nit was still at cost price. He said that\ncheaper makes can often be beaten. The\ntype they sell is safer and of an American\nmake, he said.\nHe added that a man was to be\ncharged with possession of lock breaking\nequipment in connection with the recent\nbike thefts. More such thefts have been\nreported this week.\nGrants\nThis month's Research Grant Stakes\ntrophy goes to Professor DJ Ewins of\nMechanical Engineering who has\nmanaged to extract a staggering \u00a31 505\n000 over five years from Rolls-Royce pic\nfor the Vibration Technology Centre.\nThe 'Free market economy Booby\nPrize' is presented this month to the\nScience and Engineering Research Council\n(SERC) who have given \u00a3500 over five\nmonths to Dr DJ N Limbeer of Electrical\nEngineering for the enigmatically titled\n'Visiting Fellowship: Professor U Shaked.'\nLoose Ends\n'Loose Ends on the Theory of\nEverything' will be tied up by Dr N Linden of Cambridge University on\nOctober 31st.

    "content": "Swimming\nOn Friday November 2, at the IC Sports\nCentre from 6.30pm you can swim for\nfree, courtesy of the pool management\n(many thanks), and the IC Swimming and\nWater Polo Club.\nWhy? Well it's quite simple, all\nswimmers will be raising money for\ncharity, specifically as part of the Great\nBritish Swim which involves more than\n140 swimming clubs around the country\nin aid of the National Asthma Campaign.\nDo you know anyone with asthma? It's quite likely that you do, because it is the\nmost common chronic disease in children,\naffecting more than two million people (1\nin 10 children) in the UK alone. The\nNational Asthma Campaign, through the\n'Asthma Week' and the sponsored swim\naims to raise over \u00a350,000 for research\ninto the causes of this disease.\nSo what's the catch? You know it's for\ncharity so obviously it's to do with raising\nfunds. This can be done in one of two\nways (one way you can actually win\nprizes!) Either get a sponsorship form and\nget your friends to dig deep (see details\nbelow), or if you just come along for a free swim please be prepared to make a donation to the fund. So it's not too\npainful! In return for a free swim (up to\n2!/2 hours long) all we ask for you is to\ngive a little to the National Asthma\nCampaign\u2014an undoubtedly worthy cause.\nShould you wish to get hold of\nsponsorship forms please contact Chris\nCox, through either the Mech Eng UG, or\nACC ' W pigeonholes. All those who get\nsponsored receive a certificate for their\nlabours and are eligible for a com petit on in which you can win up to \u00a3100 in\nsports equipment vouchers.\nSo help us, help yourselves and the\nNational Asthma Campaign by taking us\nup on our offer of a free swim. Come on\ndown and get wet for charity!\nOSC\nGood news for overseas students: you will\nsoon be able to find your country's newspapers in the Haldane Library. We\nhave negotiated with the College\nLibrarian, Mrs Magda Czigany, who\nkindly agreed that 25 overseas\nnewspapers will be displayed. The\nNational Societies will be responsible for\nlooking after their new papers and to\nanswer any of your questions. This means\nthat if you have a question, ask your\nsociety, not the library staff.\nThere are numerous students from\nvarious nationalities in this College who\ndo not have a National Society (eg French\nand German students). We believe that\nthere are many reasons why they should\nstart their society, the main two being: to\npromote the culture of their country and\nto contribute more actively to the\ninternational character of this college, and\nto help new students from their country\nto adapt to and to benefit from living in\nLondon.\nStarting a society is not as difficult or\nbureaucratic as it may sound, and\nsocieties' activities are usually sub sidi sed by the Union. If you feel that starting a society is a good idea, we will be happy\nto provide you with all the information\nyou need. Please let us know by writing\nto the OSC, IC Union (our pigeonhole is\nin the Union Office).\nAs for the existing so cie ites, we have\nnot heard yet from the following:\nLatin American\nMalaysia\nMiddle East\nWe remind you that it is essential to\ncheck your pigeonhole regularly and that\nyou must send a representative to OSC\nmeetings.\nHang\nGliding\nHang gliding has been established in the\nUK for over ten years, and after a rather\n'hippy image' it now enjoys a safety\nrecord on a par with skiing. A modern\nhang glider consists of about 601bs of\nDacron, aluminium and assorted wires\nand has a glide angle similar to a modern\nairliner. In skilled hands it is capable of\nsome pretty amazing performance...the\ncurrent British altitude record is 13,200\nfeet above sea level, and the cross\ncountry distance record is over 200 miles.\nThe World distance record has recently\nbeen extended to over 300 miles.\nLearning to fly a hang glider demands\nsome perseverance in the early stages,\nbut as you progress, the sport actually\nbecomes less strenuous, as first you learn\nto soar and then to land back at the top\nof the hill (instead of the bottom). We\nhave arranged for discounts on weekend\ntraining near Brighton and we will be\norganising at least two residential weeks\non the Isle of Wight over Christmas and\nEaster.\nParagliding is a comparatively new\nsport which is fast gaining popularity in\nthe UK. It originated in France where\nbored ski bums learned to foot launch\nram-air parachutes from the top of\nmountains. The canopies have developed\nto the extent that they would be useless\nas a free-fall parachute, but they have\nmuch better performance as a result.\nModern canopies have a glide angle of\nabout 6:1, which is the same as a hang\nglider ten years ago. The main advantage\nof para gliding over hang gliding is\nweight. A para glider weighs only about\n151bs, so you can carry it in a rucksack\non public transport, your bike, even take\nit when you go hill walking\u2014no more\ntedious walking down the mountain after\nyou've admired the view! Even with their\ninferior glide performance, paragliders are\nstill capable of remarkable feats\u2014\npara glider pilots regularly out climb sailplanes and hang gliders because they\ncan turn more tightly in thermals. Cross\ncountry flying is a bit easier than hang\ngliding, and is a bit quicker, but the two\nsports are highly complementary and if\nyou start learning one it is quite easy to\ntransfer to the other.\nIf you want to learn more (or just see\nsome spectacular bird's eye views of\nChina) come along to our introductory\nevening on Tuesday October 30, Room\n703 Mech Eng at 6pm. We will be\nshowing some videos and giving a talk\nabout general aspects of the two sports.\n'Hang gliding isn't quite as good as sex,\nbut it lasts a lot longer.'\u2014Robbie\nWhittal-1989 World Champion.\n15\n\n"

And the great news is that,\nof course, the first of the Lounge gigs is\ntonight with Miss America and Spirit of\nEcstacy in a co-headline slot.\nThese gigs are on a smaller scale than\nour Freshers' Week events. They are in\nthe Lounge in the Union Building and we\nstart off at 9pm with the funky happening\nDisco and then after a bit, Spirit of\nEcstacy will be performing live. This is\none of the best of the Manchester-type\nbands. Yes, you may say 'so what, they\nall sound the same' but how wrong you\nwould be. Spirit of Ecstacy have a very\noriginal sound\u2014they seem to take snip its from a wide variety of musical styles\u2014\nfrom the waa-waa guitar to the full blown\npower chords with a tight rhythm section\nmake an excellent base for the powerful\nvocal tracks (including a very nice\nharmony). They are currently being hotly\npursued by record company executives\nfrom all over the country. T have no\ndoubt that these boys will be very big'\u2014\nIan Brown (well he may of said it).\nMiss America have a different sound\nagain with a slightly more commercial\nsound but still a kicking back beat and\nsome very innovative guitar work. More\nlike a Stone Roses/Soup Dragons Inspirai\nScreem band. The only way to judge\nthem is to turn up and see for yourself.\nThe price is \u00a32 in advance from the\nUnion Office or if you are lazy \u00a32.50 on\nthe door. If you are lucky enough to hold\nan Ents card, \u00a31 will get you entry (both\nin advance and on the door\u2014if there's any tickets left).

I am sorry if people\nmissed it due to the lack of\npublicity/notice/high ticket price. The\noriginal plans were for a different type of\nevent which at late notice could not be\nstaged.

    "content": "'Wacky Doctor' Clive talks to FELIX about bananas, snail farming\nDoctor and the Medics\nWhy do you call yourself a doctor?\nI applied for medical college when I left\nschool^ to all five of the big London ones,\nand I got turned down from them all.\nWhen I was about two months old, I was\nin my mother's arms and a gypsy woman called at the door selling her wares. She\nsaid to my mum that when he grows up\nhe's going to be a doctor. I thought a gypsy woman can't be wrong, so I tried\nto be a doctor and I failed to get into\nmedical school, so instead I ended up\nwith a crap band called Doctor And The\nMedics.\nActually, it's our first gig with the new\nline-up. This is the dawning of a new age.\nA new era in the annuls of bad taste\nbegins today. We have this single coming\nout on Monday which is a version of a song that not many people have heard of.\nIt's an obscure sixties song called Hi Ho\nSilver Lining. So we're just gearing\nourselves up to hopefully get ourselves\nworking properly again.\nSo it's going to be ANOTHER cover\nversion single!\nYeah, it is. Well spotted sir! There's many reasons for doing that, they're all\nstupid reasons, this week. But to cut all\nthe bullshit, basically, we wanted to get a record deal. We're hoping to have a second bite at the apple as the first bite\nwas very nice. It was our eigth birthday\nin April this year. Its been a career of ups\nand downs really, and I suppose we've\nhad downs for the last three years.\nWe've all had jobs. I make windows,\nI'm a joiner. The customers haven't got a clue who I am. In the workshop, I'm the\nscruffy cunt in the corner who snarls at\nall the customers, and that's it. I 've got\nwives and babies and things like that to\nsupport. Steve, you'll notice, his guitar\ntechnique is a hell of a lot better 'cos he's had a job screwing the caps on bottles in\na bottling factory. That action, over and\nover again has given him this technique.\nApparantly, Eric Clapton saw Steve play\nrecently and was so impressed by this\ntechnique that he's now hoping to get a job in the bottling factory next week so\nhe can get this little twist. You'll notice\nSteve does it tonight, only 'cos he's pissed\nand on the wrong strings.\nHow can we follow that?\nYes, and my mother was a piece of\ncarpet, she's here in my pocket. So\nbasically, that's why we've got this single\ncoming out. I was even in Mr. Abusing\nthis week. They said I should be flown\nout to Iraq with a note saying 'Saddam\nHussein do something or other' and that I should be used as his moustache for his\nsnot or something.\nHow do you get into the Talk Talk\npages of Melody Maker?\nIn our case, just by being a right bunch\nof pricks for eight years. That seems to\nwork.\nWhat are your views on the Gulf\nsituation?\nWell, I think Tony Jacklin was a great\nplayer and since he's left, the whole golf\nsituation is not as good as it used to be.\nAnd they're a great car... Nuke the\nfuckers!\nPeople ask me for advice on anything.\nCome on, who's qualified? Failed\nmusician, failed snail farmer, failed joiner,\nyou know. I 've not succeeded at anything\nin my fucking life. Snail farming failed\nmiserably and I'm blaming Chernobyl. I put in a claim to European Agriculture.\nThere's a compensation thing for people\nwho had losses from Chernobyl. There's a few people in Wales who lost a lot of\nsnails as a result of it and I put in this\nclaim, yeah? The thing is, they're putting\nin for the loss of the snails. I'm claiming\nthat I was writting an album about snails\nat the time, and that since they've died,\nmy inspiration has gone. The album was\ngoing to be a top seller so I' msu eing them for \u00a3 5 0 m which is what the album\nwould have reached. That's going through\nat the moment. I hope to hear about it.\nWho writes all the stuff?\nWell, Jeff Beck wrote the last one,\nNorman Greenbaum wrote the one before\nthat, and Bjorn and Benny from Abba the\none before that. We did a version of\nWaterloo years ago. We dressed up as\nthe Abba girls on video with long blond\nwigs on. We did that with Roy Wood.\nThe girls sang it. I just conducted the\norchestra and played the sax a phone. It\nwas the coolest video we ever did. No, I don't particularly want to play it tonight,\nin fact I think we played it live about\ntwice.\nThe rest of the stuff now, Steve and I write it all. Steve and I always used to\nwrite it but we used to give Richard our\npublishing royalties for sitting and doing\nnothing, but Richard's left now. The\nreason Richard, our bass player, left was\nthat he didn't want to be seen in a band\nthat played Hi Ho Silver Lining. It was\ntoo much for his credibility.\nWho do you listen to?\nJeff Beck mainly now. On the phone.\n'You bastards, how dare you' he said. I listen to anything that's good. I 'll listen to\nBlack Sabbath one day if I want to, I 'll\nlisten to Black Sabbath the next day and\nthen some days I listen to Black Sabbath.\nAnything really, from Pink Floyd through\nto Wham, except Iha v n't listened to any\nWham. That was a lie. So, Pink Floyd\nand Black Sabbath really.\nWhat I think is great in music is The\nStones still being around. After all th ii and old men's willies. The Damned Phantom Chords were\nthere too.\nThe Phantom Chords\ntime, The Stones are still here. Old Fred\nand Barny. Sorry, that was very uncalled\nfor. Yeah.\nHow about the Manchester scene?\nThe Stone Roses supported us in 1985\nat the Croydon Greyhound and they were\nshit then, and they're shit now. Let's be\nhonest, Echo and the Bunnymen started\nall that thing rolling years ago and I still\nthink they do that kind of thing a hell of\na lot better.\nDo you go to gigs a lot or do you\ntend to stay away?\nNo, I don't tend to really these days. I go to gigs when there's bands playing\nthat I like to see but Val Doonican hasn't toured for years now. I enjoy gigs a lot\nmore these days 'cos I have to pay to go\nin. I saw Pink Floyd at Wembley three\nyears ago. That was really good.\nWhere did you get the violets?\nThe opticians. If you have a look\nthrough them, you'll see what I'm talking\nabout. I'm blind. It's better than taking\nacid, isn't it? They're proper glasses.\nEveryone thinks I'm a posey bastard.\nWith a face like mine, you've got to hide\nsome of it. Look, there's a man eating a banana!\nI once had a book by Al, the magician,\nAli Bongo. I read it when I was sixteen\nand it said you should do something\ndifferent every day, even if its just eating\na banana. It didn't make sense to me at\nthe time, but I started eating bananas. It\nsaid that bananas were the best food\nbecause they were slimming, they were\ngood for you, they came in convenient\npackaging. They were like some mystical\nfood and you should eat one a day, so I started eating a banana a day for like two\ndays. Nothing happened.\nWe're working on abject failure tonight.\nNo, no-one goes out on Saturday night,\ndo they? They're showing a replay of\nBeardsley's goal against Poland tonight, a lot of people staying in for that. I loved\nthe World Cup.\nWho do you support?\nAt the moment 1 support two children\nand a wife, but I was born in Liverpool\nand the whole family is Liverpudlian mad so no I don't.I used to go and watch ice\nhockey, but only because I was hot. I used to lick the ice.\nWhat wallpaper did you have as a child?\nLike every other Liverpudlian bastard\nwe just used to put brown paper on the\nwall. It was only brown because it was\ntoilet paper that had been used. I don't say anything that I regret really, apart\nfrom 's pip snork'. That's the only thing\nI 've ever said that I regret saying, 'cos its\nfucking stupid. I'm an intelligent man. I have letters after my name, C.U.N.T. Most of my childhood was spent in the\ncubs and scouts. I used to like the feel of\nold men's willies up my bottom. Are we\na bitter band? No, Steve drinks lager.\nHow do you cook asparagus? Boil it.\nRare & SJH.\nHow did The Phantom Chords get\ntogether?\nWe knew what to do. Dave decided to\ndo this thing on his own and he asked\nmyself and Brin to go off and do it with\nhim, which meant the end of The\nDamned.\nSo it's fluid rock and roll basically\nnow?\nNo, its not. We do a few songs that you\ncould class as rockabilly. There again we\ndo a thing from the beatnik era. Its a musical collage. Played live it should be a little bit exciting as opposed to just humdrum copies of wie rd sounds on the\nalbum.\nSo you think your material is\nboring?\nWell, Johnny Remember Me wasn't our\nchoice, it was bowing to record company\npressure. Its always very difficult to\nmaintain your integrity when you've\nsigned to the people paying your wages.\nWe did Johnny Remember Me as The\nDamned. I don't think there is a single on\nthe album. You should put on something\nthat represents you. The very reason that\nThe Phantom Chords are here now and\nThe Damned are not is that it's us. It was\nthe natural progression. Its a little bit of\nfresh air to go on and play something\nthat people h avn' t heard before. Its a challenge. We're trying to get away from\nThe Damned. Before Christmas I reckon\nwe'll be in The Marquee. Obviously we\nwould like to go back to bigger gigs, but\nits back to the basics. I don't work, this is\nall I do, with a spot of producing, a spot\nof session work and write some songs.\nThe Damned carried on for a while, did a few shows, just to get some money. The\nfirst Phantom Chords demos we did were\nnearly two years ago. It took that long to\nget it all together. Its the same old story\nas a new band. Things were working\nagainst us, like the reputation we had.\nWhen you play say Hammersmith Odeon,\nyou have to do a slick show as people\npay so much they expect a slick show.\nWhen you just play a club its just put\nyour amp on some beer crates. We managed to do that on big and small\nvenues. The stuff that I wrote for The\nDamned was pretty fi ckel, but that was\ndue to my immaturity. Its got to be more\nthan the sky is blue, the grass is green\nand mud is brown. Dan & Rare.\n\n"

    "content": "The Little\nMermaid\nThis film is nicer than Felicity Kendal\nwith a plate chock full of Bakewell tarts.\nIt tells a tale of piscine love with a few\nsongs thrown in for good measure. Ariel,\nthe little mermaid, is fascinated by\nhumanity and has amassed a larger\ncollection of consumer durable s than\nArgos (the shop, not the ship). She longs\nto see humans, even though this is not\nthe done thing, and of course she decides\nto investigate a passing Sealink. Naturally\nshe goes and falls in love with a tall,\nhandsome, heterosexual, clean living,\nupright pillar of society, who by true\nDisney standards is also a prince. Well,\nshe is now obsessed with this forbidden\npassion (sounds like 9V2 Weeks) to the\nextent that she goes and does A Foolish\nThing.\nAt this point there enters a catalyst in\nthe ointment, in the be tentacled form of\nUrsula (The Sea Witch! boo hiss) who offers Ariel a part-exchange deal: One spanking new pair of Reebok leg gies( female thankfully) for a down payment\nof a Dulcet Singing Voice in good repair.\nThis is a Fatal Error but we're not going\nto tell you why( HA! HA! Go watch the\nfilm!) and proves to be Ariel's undoing.\nAgainst the best advice of her\ncompanions, Flounder (a blue and yellow\nbeach ball fish) and Sebastian (a Carib\ncrab with a yen for composition) she goes\nfor the prize and hits the wooden spoon\nwith such force that she is incapable of\nsaying anything for most of the rest of\nthe film.\nThis being a true Disney mermaid film,\nthe tragic ending of the original Hans\nChristian Andersen story (dying, turning\nto stone/cloud, generally not getting the\nguy anyway) is neatly diverted to good\nfamily viewing. (Can any readers\nremember the actual ending to The Little\nMermaid Mkl? Answers on a postcard to\nFELIX please).\nThe animation is as usual beyond\ncompare; the story is more pleasant than\nFelicity Kendal and Richard Briers put\ntogether and also reduces the effective\nage of the viewer by a factor of three. Be\nprepared to hiss, boo and c hear at\nappropriate moments.\nThis is a good film. Go and see it now.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine.\nGoodFellas REVIEWS\nThe Mafia is an element of ItalianAmerican culture that has an undeniable\nfascination to the film akers of Hollywood.\nSurprising, though, to see a director of\nthe calibre of Martin Scorsese taking on the subject. Scorsese, responsible for\nmovies like Raging Bull, Colour of Money,\nTaxi Driver and the, shall we say,\ncontroversial Last Temptation Of Christ,\nhas chosen to adapt a book written from\na series of interviews with ex-mobster\nHenry Hill, now on the Federal Witness\nProgram.\nThe result is a fascinating, un-glamorous\nportrait of how the Mafia (or goodfellas\nor wise guys, as they call themselves)\nreally work. We are lead through the life\nof Henry from his early days skipping\nschool to run errands for Paul Cicerone,\nto his eventual fall at the hands of\nNarcotic agents. In between we have the\nlaughs and murders, wives and\nmistresses, heists and dinners that make\nup his life.\nThe insights we get are fascinating. The relationships between the pure Italians\nand the wise guys of mixed blood are\nexamined, as are the wise guys' relationships with the local community\nand the police.\nThe cast is good, and big. Robert De\nNiro is, as ever, superb in the role James\nConway one of the wise guys who rises to\npower with Hill. His portrayal of the\nruthless man who slowly descends into\nparanoia is masterly. Also good is\nLorraine Bracco as Karen Hill, the girl\nwho is at once turned on and appalled by\nher husband's activities. The marriage\nsequence has to be one of the most\nbizarre in the movie.\nTo call this a thriller would be wrong,\nbut it has elements of that genre. To call\nit a comedy would also be wrong. It is a film that totally defies any sort of\ncategorising except one - good. By far the\nbest movie on general release at the\nmoment, this really is a worth a chunk of\nyour grant.\nPendragon.\nJudge Dredd Megazine\nWithin six days of its release this new\ngraphic magazine had sold 40,000 copies.\nThis is not too surprising because Judge\nDredd is Britain's most popular comic\ncharacter appearing weekly in 2000AD and daily in the Star newspaper.\nSet in a future where overpopulation\ncalls for overcrowded cities of tower\nblocks, with mass unemployment and few\nreleases for all the pent up tensions.\nMany citizens turn to crime which calls\nfor a police system which can dispense\ninstant justice. Trained from the age of\nfive, judges are empowered to apprehend,\ntry and sentence on the spot. Dredd is\nthe best judge (even though he's getting\nold) and stories tend to follow his\nadventures through the weird and\nwonderful city of 800 million people (give\nor take 200 million for war, disease,\ngenocide, etc).\nThe stories in the Megazine (Mega\nbecause the city is Mega City 1) go for a far wider view than just Dredd himself.\nCurrently only one story follows his\nexploits while the others follow related\ncharacters. Chapper is back, after a number of stories in 2000AD, in a dubious story about corporate revenge,\nJudge Death is also back giving an insight\ninto his past and Kenny Who? is back\nalthough I have no idea why. Possibly the\nmost interesting story is America which\ntells of a Mega City 1 citizen who questions the judges right to hold\ncomplete control without democracy.\nAnyone who has read an issue may note\nthat I missed Mega City Newspaper. This\nis quite intentional. Overall the Megazine\nis pretty good but there is a lot of room for improvement (like how about more\nDredd??).\nThe Amazing Machine.\n\n"
