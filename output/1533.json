Instead, doodle all lecture long and then send us your drawings\nto arts.felix@ic.ac.uk. This doodle was done by in Giulia Zerbini during\nplasticelectronics.\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\n10\nDeath. It is a bit of a downer is it not? We\nspend our entire lives trying to escape\nthe shadow of the reaper, constantly re-mindedofourownmortality.Theticking\nclock, wilting \ufb02owers, it all emphasizes\nhowlittletimewehaveleftonthisplanet.\nButdeathisalsoafascinationforhumanity; we obsess about the idea of what lies\nbeyond with a kind of morbid curiosity,\nand no-one represents this attitude better than Richard Harris. An American\nart collector, Harris has been collecting\nworksrelatedtodeathforthelastdecade,\nand now has close to 1500 pieces in his\ncollectionofmacabrecuriosities.Itisthis\ncollection which forms the basis of the\nWellcome Collection\u2019s latest exhibition,\nentitled Death: A Self-portrait, which is\nby turns depressing, horrifying, and up-lifting.\nThe exhibition begins with works contemplating death, a selection of memento\nmori exploring the complex relationship\nwe have with death. Japanese sculptures\nof snakes slithering through skulls are\njuxtaposed with prints warning against\nleading a sinful life. The Victorian idea\nof a \u2018good death\u2019 is explored here: those\nwho have lived in a godly, sin-free manner would greet death like a friend, while\nthose who have been greedy will try\nand stave the reaper o\ufb00 for as long as\npossible before succumbing, terri\ufb01ed,\ninto the abyss. The highlight of this section is the selection of exquisite still-life\npaintings, including a marvellous piece\nby the Dutch painter Adriaen van Utrecht. In this work, which is dripping with\nsymbolism, skulls are placed alongside\nblooming \ufb02owers, and delicate soap bubbles represent the fragility of life.\nThe exhibition continues to explore\nthe various facets of death in this way,\npresenting it not as a hollow, cadaverous\nentity, but rather something very much\nalive. Puppets from the US, and Tibetan\nwoodcuts look at the role of death in\nmusic, focussing on the Danse Macabre,\nthe artistic idea that death unites all. In\nfrenzied paintings skeletons of kings cavort with paupers, and corpses jive to\nunheard music. Following this humorous interlude we are presented with the\nidea of \u2018Violent Death\u2019\n, a series of works\nexploring war and su\ufb00ering. Superb\netchings by Goya show in vivid detail the\ntorture and abuse faced by the Spanish in\nthe early stages of Napoleon\u2019s invasion;\nalongside Otto Dix\u2019s brutal depictions\nof the First World War in his Der Krieg\nseries, these works present Death as a\nwarlord, triumphantly overseeing the\nmassacre of both soldiers and civilians.\nThe following room focuses on the\nrelationship between Freud\u2019s theories\nof Eros, the life drive, and Thanatos, the\ndeath drive, or the tendency of people to\ngo towards death and destruction. The\nworks show the obsession humanity has\nwithdeath;likefootageofanaccident,we\nwant to look away, but we just can\u2019t. One\nwork from around 1900, entitled When\nShall We Meet Again?, portrays a group\nof medical students standing around a\n\ufb02ayed cadaver, its skin peeled back and\nmuscles exposed. It provided an insight\ninto what had \u2013 up until then \u2013 been a\nclosely guarded aspect of medical train-ing: the dissection of corpses for study.\nThis dichotomy between the living and the dead continues as the next\nroom explores how the dead are commemorated around the world. A beautiful selection of works, which are by\nturns wickedly funny and deeply mov-ing, show how death is approached in\ndi\ufb00erent cultures. Vivid photographs\nof Day of the Dead celebrations, during\nwhich spirits are welcomed into the af-terlife, contrast with the set of European\npostcards from the early 20th Century,\nwhich show kissing couples metamorphosing into grinning skulls. A particular favourite of mine was the series\nof pictures by Marcos Raya, a Mexican\nartist who takes vintage portraits and\npaints skulls over peoples faces; instead\nof seeing a smiling couple at the alter, a\npair of gurning skeletons turns to face\nus. They do possess a dark humour, but\nalso remind us of the inevitable presence\nof death in our lives.\nThis show sets out with the intention of looking death square in the face,\nbut death doesn\u2019t have a face, it doesn\u2019t\nhave a motive; it is simply an event that\neveryone observes, but no-one actually\nexperiences \ufb01rst hand. What this collection actually does is explore humanity\u2019s\nattachment to death, and in some sense\nthe human condition as well, resulting\nin a show which may be morbid, but is\nultimately inspiring. On this occasion,\ndeath isn\u2019t necessarily a downer.\nAt the Wellcome Collection. Until 24th\nFebruary. Free entry.\nFred Fyles Writer\nNaked charity skydive\ngoes horribly wrong\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nAgeing slowly\nOn the day of writing this I am turning\n23, and now probably need to become a\nterribly serious individual, or something\nlike that. I say this because that is what\nhappens as you get older: you become\nall grown up and proper. You use words\nlike \u201cwhom\u201d, have food that has been\n\u201cdrizzled\u201dwitholiveoil,andlistentoBBC\nRadio 4. Admittedly, I love things drizzled in olive oil, but that\u2019s not exactly my\npoint. I won\u2019t bore you too much with a\n\u201cnever let the inner child shrivel and die\u201d\ntypespiel,butIreallythinkitneedstobe\nsaid. I feel like nowadays a lot of people\njust take life, themselves, and everything in between a little bit too seriously.\nBirthdays are usually fun, if not spent\nfeverishly trying to finish and compile\na paper on time (as this one is for me).\nHowever, there is the slightly morbid\nsense of \u201cyay, I\u2019m one year older! Uhoh,\nI\u2019m ONE YEAR OLDER. I\u2019M SO OLD\u201d.\nFor me, it\u2019s not too bad... yet. I\u2019ll start\nthe tantrums about my age when my\nNatWest Young Person\u2019s Railcard runs\nout. That\u2019s the moment when you know\nyou\u2019re really an old person. Then again,\nI\u2019ve stopped being ID\u2019d when buying al-cohol, so that\u2019s a bad sign already.\nIt\u2019s funny how when you get older\nyou flip round with your younger self.\nWhen you\u2019re younger, it\u2019s cool to write\nevrythng lyk dis izn\u2019t it. When you hit\n6th form, that\u2019s suddenly really lame.\nAt the age of about 19, being ID\u2019d is\nbasically tantamount to the person at\nthe checkout slapping you in the face\nwith a baby\u2019s bottle and telling you to\ngo back home to mummy. The second\n21 rolls around, you start trying to talk\nloudly about upcoming SATs in a bid to\nmake someone ask you for proof of age.\nOf course, when actually asked, you\nalways have fake \u201cI was drinking bad\nwhite wine since before you were born\nson\u201d indignance.\nThe strangest thing that happens as\nthe years roll on is that you lose touch\nwith your former generation. You forget who you used to be. You start being confused by younger generations\nand start to distort and twist memories\nof who and what you were at that age.\nThe amount of people saying \u201coh, the\nyoufs are terrible\u201d is a testament to how\nyou forget what you were like. Perhaps\nyoung people today have become a\nbit worse than before. Or, maybe, they\nare just as rowdy etc but in a different\nway to how you remember being crazy.\nWhat seems like straight up debauchery to you now, may not actually be as\nbad as what you did. In fact, it may not\neven be that different, but you\u2019re just\nmisremembering (usually caused by an\naffliction know as rose-tinteditis), or you\nare unable to draw parallels as their culture seems so alien. E.g. Common com-plaint: the kids today spend all their time\nmessing about with silly, new technol-ogy, they deserve a good thrashing (and\nnot in the kinky way). Answer: you were\nthe exact same as them. It\u2019s just the\ntechnology has changed. What seems\nto you to be acceptable technology to\nobsess over is just old news to the kids\ntoday. It used to be a TV that everyone\nwould want, now it\u2019s the latest iPhone.\nThere\u2019s no way that in a column of\nthis size I can go into as much depth as\nI would like to on this subject; there\u2019s\ndefinitely no way that I can protect myself from the internet hatred by arguing\neverything in a nuanced and carefully\ndeconstructing way. Therefore, I will\njust ask every single reader of this text\nto think about one thing. I\u2019ll assume\nyou\u2019re all at university: what is the latest\ncraze that 10 year old kids are in to? Can\nyou answer it? Remember crazes: pogs,\nPok\u00e9mon, football stickers, Aliens that\ncould \u201cmate to produce children\u201d (they\ncouldn\u2019t by the way)? I can\u2019t say what\nit is. Think about what that means: you\nare technically out of touch with them.\nSo next time you think an older person is just out of touch, remember that\nwe all are in a way. Don\u2019t shout at them\nfor being \u201dancient\u201d, help them regain\ntouch.I\u2019llleaveyouwiththat,nowIneed\nto celebrate my birthday by updating\nthe website.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER 11\narthquakes in London is a\nplay that could so easily go\nwrong. With (brief) nu-dity, temporal shifts (the\nnarrative jumps around\nbetween 1928 and 2525) and philosophical passages on the doomed\nnature of man due to his treatment\nof the earth, it is tailor made to ful\ufb01ll\nevery \u201cit\u2019s all symbolic, innit\u201d clich\u00e9 of\nstudent drama.\nIt is a great credit to Dramsoc\u2019s production of Mike Bartlett\u2019s 2010 play\nthat it avoids that.\nThe original production premiered\nat the National Theatre, and the\nstory is built around three sisters,\ndaughters of renowned Climate scientist Robert Crannock, who is now\na climate change doom monger after spending his younger days as an\nadvocate for airline companies and\ntheir expansion. The daughters, Sarah, a Lib Dem cabinet minister in\nthe Coalition Government, Freya,\na heavily pregnant house wife, and\nJasmine, a hedonistic student who\u2019s\nbeen kicked out of university are estranged from him. The play uses their\nfamily dynamics to cover such wide\nranging issues as the relationship between government, big business and\nscience, the wisdom of bringing children into a seemingly doomed world,\nand our role as humans in destroying\nthe environment with a hefty dose of\nfamily melodrama thrown in for good\nmeasure.\nThe original production won plaudits for it\u2019s stage design and, though\nlacking the resources of the National\nTheatre, Dramsoc comes up with an\ninnovative contraption of their own,\nthe most prominent feature of which\nis a ramped runway that ends up half\nway down the Union Concert Hall,\nseemingly thrusting the audience into\nthe action. The staging also allows for\nsome \u20183D\u2019 stage arrangements with\naction taking place in another plane\nto what regular theatregoers will be\nused to.\nThe production is technically complex and engaging, and comes across\nas a multimedia mashup, with atmospheric lighting that e\ufb00ectively leads\nyou through what to follow on stage,\nimpressive sound design that surrounds you and doesn\u2019t stop throughout the show and video sequences, a\nparticular stand out being an ultrasound of Freya\u2019s unborn child, complementing the action on stage.\nThe action on stage is slightly men-tal, with so much going on it\u2019s a credit\nto director James Perry that you can\nstill follow the story. Very often, different scenes overlap and at one point\nI counted four taking place at the same\ntime. You could very easily watch\nsomething else besides the currently\nlit scene and the cast do an amazing\njob of staying in character even when\nthe spotlight is not on them.\nThe large supporting cast do well\nplaying a variety of roles, helped by\ncostumes that make it clear when\nan actor has moved on and is now\n\u2018someone else\u2019. A particularly striking\nStepford Wives sequence should be\nthe rhythms and emphases of the\ndialogue, missing a lot of the humour\nand depth originally intended in the\nscript. It\u2019s like the actors don\u2019t understand the motivations and thought\nprocesses of characters many years\nolder than they are. Which leads to\nsome moments, sometimes whole\nscenes, falling \ufb02at and seeming one\nnoted, making the overriding message\nof the play one of impending doom.\nThis the production communicates\ne\ufb00ectively, especially when focusing on the character of Freya (Grace\nSurman), who gradually gets more\nfreaked out about having a baby in a\nworld that her father has predicted\nis doomed to destruction, but every\nnow and then, you do wish for the ac-Oluwatosin Ajayi reviews DramSoc\u2019s Earthquakes in London\ntors to deliver something light to alleviate proceedings.\nA highly recommended evening out\nat the theatre, and a show that you can\npay a compliment without just seeming polite. There is plenty to enjoy and\nmarvel at and also a lot you might not\nget after seeing the play once, but if\nyou are too cash strapped/busy par-tying/stuck in the library to go see it\nmore than once, just tell yourself \u201cIt\u2019s\nall symbolic innit?\u201d For the rest of\nyou, see it with friends, you are likely\ngoing to want to dissect it afterwards.\nDramsoc\u2019s Earthquakes in London has\ntwo more performances on Friday the\n30th November and Saturday 1st December. Tickets are \u00a36 on the door.\nwatched out for.\nOf the principal characters, Giulia\nZerbini is a revealing \ufb01t as a Whiny\nTeenage boy, who has a crucial role\nto play in the plot; Roxanne Middleton performs a brilliant and brave\nburlesque routine as the hedonistic\nJasmine, and most people at Imperial\nwill see something prescient in the\nidealistic young PhD student played\nby Chris Witham, who has his scienti\ufb01c principles tested and ends up\nas a jaded, embittered, cynical and\nemotionally distant retired Professor\nplayed by Kristen Farebrother.\nAn immersive, thought provoking and at times worrying produc-tion, there is nevertheless a feeling\nthat some of the cast don\u2019t quite get\nEarthshatteringly good\nE\nDancing through a Revue\nWhen I attended a run-through of\nMTSoc\u2019s new production, Dancing\nThrough Life, none of them suspected\nthat I was in fact a theatre critic in dis-guise. This was probably because I occasionally make a somewhat convincing keyboard player. So convincing\nI\u2019m actually playing in the show next\nweek. None-the-less I had my critic\u2019s\nhat on as I settled down to watch the\nperformers for the \ufb01rst time.\nFeaturing a diverse range of songs\nfrom Tim Minchin, Wicked and even\nHigh School Musical, this was an ambitious project from the start. Made\nworse by the fact that most of the cast\nare freshers, most of the directors\nare new to directing, and most of the\nnumbers have a completely di\ufb00erent\nproduction team to the others. Would\nthe show hold together, let alone hold\nup to previous productions?\nThey begin with the opening numbers from the critically acclaimed The\nBook of Mormon, which is just about\nto hit the West End. Back in March,\nMTSoc attempted to put on the whole\nmusical with just 24 hours notice. Fortunately they have put more practice\ninto the songs this time around and\nhave even managed to synchronise\nthe miming of pushing buttons with\ndoorbell sounds \u2013 genius! If anything\ngoes wrong, though, no doubt a certain keyboard player will be taken\nbackstage and shot.\nIt has long been known to the average Imperial male that this term brings\nwith it American girls. MTSoc have\ncottoned on and are now able to perform the fantastically energetic and\ngirly \u201cOMG You Guys!\u201d from Legally\nBlonde: The Musical with fourteen,\nyes fourteen, females! This increased\nratio has meant they have not needed\nto resort to gay kissing like last year.\nTalking of gay kissing, after spending the summer playing a character\ndescribed as \u2018James Dean in an old\nfolks home\u2019, veteran performer Phil\nRaymond must be feeling his age with\nso many fresh faces surrounding him.\nFortunately, despite his advanced\nyears, his Top G never fails to send\nshivers down my spine as he demonstrates in \u2018El Tango de Roxanne\u2019\nfrom Moulin Rouge. Another personal\nhighlight is listening to \u2018I Dreamed a\nDream\u2019 from Les Mis sung beautifully\nbut without the compromise of having\nto spend four minutes looking at Susan Boyle\u2019s face.\nThey suitably end on an emotional\nnumber from Ragtime featuring the\nwhole cast. From this song it is easy\nto see how Alicia Kearns earned\nher nickname \u2018Sassy F***\u2019. Her silky\nsmooth alto voice emphatically ends\nthe show in style.\nLast year\u2019s successful revue show\nCharming only required a few lyric\nchanges to make a believable story,\nbut with such a random assortment of\nsongs this year I was initially worried\nthat MTSoc would attempt the same\nthing again. I struggled to think of a\nsituation where Mormons and witches\nwould go hand in hand but thankfully\nthey have treated this year\u2019s revue as\na medley of musical theatre numbers\nrather than trying to force a contrived\nand tenuous story around them.\nSeeing the incredible energy (and\ncheesy grins) of the new members\nmakes me wish I had joined MTSoc\nback in my \ufb01rst year. It\u2019s hard to see\nthe fun these guys have on stage and\nnot feel jealous! I am honoured that\nthey have asked me back to play keyboards with them now I have graduated and look forward to sharing the\nlimelight with them next week.\n\u2018Dancing Through Life\u2019 runs Monday\n3rd \u2013 Wednesday 5th December in the\nUnion Concert Hall. Doors open at\n7pm, show starts at 7:30pm. It is completely FREE and donations to ICU\nRAG Save the Children will be much\nappreciated.\nOh, and, turn to the Centrefold...\nGareth Campbell Writer\nDon\u2019t look so\ndisappointed, a\n3rd from Imperial\nis still good\n\n"

The\nevent was for the UK launch of the Nokia Lumias 820 & 920. Read\nnext weeks issue for his report on the street rave and after party.\n17\nJason Parmar Technology Editor\nriting the overleaf article on\nGoogle Music\u2019s\nintroduction to\nthe UK market\nreminded me of an interesting question that I\u2019ve been asking myself for a\nwhile, \u201chas the progress in the digital\nmusic market, which gives consumers\na better deal, reduced the amount we\nillegal download?\u201d\nI think that Google and Spotify have\nthe potential to enjoy a rich future in\nthe music industry, and I\u2019m sure their\ncompetitors will follow in their footsteps in what is now a very fast moving\nand dynamic market. However, has all\nof this progress actually helped the ef\ufb01ciency of music distribution, helped\nconsumers, helped the musicians and/\nor helped reduce illegal downloading.\nBackground\nBack in the very late 90\u2019s-early nough-ties, many people, especially young\npeople, couldn\u2019t always a\ufb00ord to buy\nthe expensively priced CD\u2019s. So many\ntook advantage of easy-to-use illegal P2P services such as Napster or\nLimeWire (to name just a few). Napster, which was co-founded in 1999 by\nall round badass and Facebook founding President Sean Parker (played by\nJustin Timberlake in The Social Network), was the main site of choice for\nmany and is associated with bringing\n\u201cthe recording industry to its knees\u201d,\nalbeit like a slow poison. But one thing\nthe P2P services did was to encourage\nand move people to digital music, and\nin doing so, Apple, in 2001, released\nthe iTunes store and made an absolute\nmint for record labels, musicians (to\nan extent) and cut costs for consum-ers. Although some people continued\nand took up illegally downloading,\nmany moved to legal online music\nservices. One decade on and we\u2019ve\nseen a huge increase in uptake of legal downloading and streaming, most\nprominently for Spotify here in the\nUK and perhaps in the future Google\nMusic as well as Apple, Amazon, Sony,\nMicrosoft, YouTube and borderine legal services of Grooveshark & Hypem.\nIllegal downloading down?\nThere are several con\ufb02icting sources\nof illegal music downloading and the\nmarket circulating around the inter-net. However, one of the most reliable\nto consider is that of MusicMetric,\nwho conducted \u201cone of the most comprehensive studies of unauthorized\nmusic downloads to date\u201d. The young\ncompany was founded in 2007 by,\nbelieve it or not, an Imperial College\nPhysics student in his \ufb01nal year with\ntwo friends from Exeter and UCL\n(urgh). They actually secured their\n\ufb01rst ever investment in the Felix Of\ufb01ce where this paper is produced, as\nthe current CEO, Gregory Mead was\na Felix writer. Moving on, the company who is regarded as the \u201cworld\u2019s\nlargest music trend data asset\u201d study\nreveals that there has been a drop in\nunauthorised music downloads in the\nUK, US, Canada, Sweden and Norway. These are reductions in illegal\ndownloading are being strongly linked\nwith online streaming services such\nas Spotify, who as previously stated,\nwere valued at $3 billion by Goldman\nSachs this month and are predicted to\nearn over $1 billion this year world-wide. My straw polling of Imperial\nstudents (which of course are highly\nreliable and accurate) appear to agree\ntoo. Over the last four years I\u2019ve been\nhere I\u2019ve de\ufb01nitely noticed an increase\nin the amount of people using legal\nmusic services and illegally downloading less.\nAlthough there has been a 16%\ndrop in UK spending in music, compared with 2.6% globally, people\u2019s access to music is still increasing and is\nevidence that the market has innovated into new revenue and e\ufb03ciency\nstreams. By o\ufb00ering consumers lower\nprices for services that allow them to\nlisten to even more music, more con\u201c\nit\u2019s [now] so\neasy to operate within the\nbounds of the\nlaw there is no\nneed to go beyond them\nveniently and with better interfaces\nthey have increased their client base.\nIn addition by doing this online, they\nhave slashed billions of dollars in distribution costs that can now be reinvested into providing better services\nand lower prices for consumers. This\nis what Napster over a decade ago\npredicted would happen, it just took\nlonger than expected, with the recording labels lasting an impressively\nlong time before slowly dying or in-novating.\nPresident of the American Association of Independent Music (AAIA),\nRich Benglo\ufb00, says \u201cproviding alternatives to illegal \ufb01le sharing and downloading is a \u201cno-brainer\u201d\u201d and \u201cpricing\nit at a level that is attractive enough\nto them that they don\u2019t want to pirate\nmusic\u201d.\nGoogle appear to agree with a representative of Google Music saying\n\u201cI think [the service] is something\nthat is hopefully going to make piracy\nobsolete because it\u2019s so easy to operate within the bounds of the law that\nthere is really no need to go beyond\nthem\u201d. As does ARIA CEO Dan Rosen\nwho says \u201cnew digital music services\ncertainly assist with reducing music\npiracy\u201d and that \u201cwith almost all music now being available for free or at\na low cost, there is no justi\ufb01cation for\nany music fan to use pirate sites where\nno money go to artists or labels\u201d.\nTo summarise, there appears to be\nan interesting (and very obvious) link\nbetween the market o\ufb00ering competitively priced alternatives to illegal\ndownloading and then seeing a reduction in illegal downloading.\nAlthough, not all agree. Some think\naggressive government interventions\nare the way forward. That\u2019s certainly\nthe opinion of Joshua Friedlander who\nevaluates data for AAIA, who claims\n\u201cthere was an immediate increase in\ndigital music sales (after LimeWire\nwas removed), so whenever one of\nthese sites closes, we\u2019re de\ufb01nitely\nmoving some people on to the many\nlegal services that are now available\u201d.\nSo in truth, it\u2019s a mixture of the two\nthat\u2019s resulted in a reduction in illegal\ndownloading, for music at least. The\nconclusion I want to make with this\narticle is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be long,\nand I hope it\u2019s not, until we see more\nonline digital markets move in this di-rection.\nWe\u2019re already seeing it, for exam-ple, with TV and \ufb01lm. Net\ufb02ix and\nLoveFilm are the two biggest players\nat the moment, and their competition is helping to drive down prices\nand increase the ease of usability for\nconsumers. This has encouraged millions more people to subscribe to their\nservices, stop renting from ine\ufb03cient\ntangible based services such as Blockbuster and slightly reduce illegally\ndownloading. It won\u2019t be long until\nthe PC games industry follows suit,\nwith Steam looking to take the lead as\nthe promising OnLive service unfortunately grew too fast too quickly and\nfailed (being valued at $1.8 billion and\nbeing sold for under $5 million in the\nspace of a year). The most interesting\nmarket to follow though, will be that\nof the Software giants. Who knows,\nin a few years\u2019 time we may all be\nnot ever have to pay a one-o\ufb00 fee for\nsoftware and instead just pay annual\nsubscriptions to Microsoft, Apple,\nAdobe etc. for the latest software (and\nmaybe even hardware) instead of relying on cheap student deals or, what\nmore regularly happens, \u201cborrowing\u201d\na copy from the internet.\nToo long, didn\u2019t read (TLDR)\nIllegal music downloading is reducing as prices go down and services\ngo up (YES capitalism, YES mar-kets). Other industries should learn\nand innovate to prevent and finally\nkill illegal downloading.\nTV & Film is underway with NetFlix and LoveFilm, eBooks are well on\ntheir way, Gaming tried and failed\n(poor OnLive) but should keep going and the Software should start\noffering just subscription, high\nvalue-for-money and more efficient\nbusiness models to benefit consumers (i.e. Microsoft, Adobe, Apple,\netc).\nW\nThe fallen torrenting giants\n\n"

    "content": "t\u2019s Saturday. You want to go\nto a nice restaurant to enjoy a\nproper meal (for once!) with\nyour friends. You are dreaming of a huge three course\nmeal, a delicious starter, a great main\ndish and a luxurious dessert accompanied with good wine of course but\nthen you suddenly realise that you\ncan\u2019t a\ufb00ord it!\nWell, I have good news for you.\nEven if you think that your cooking\nskills are nonexistent you can make\na fantastic three course meal in just 2\nhours, at minimum cost and trust me\nit will make your friends think that\nyou are a secret chef! So, invite your\nfriends and follow my three extremely simple recipes that will make your\ndinner party a huge success. Who\nknows? You might get people asking\nto come and live with you after this.\n(Happened to me, just saying....)\nStarter:\nAubergine and honey\nheaven\nWords cannot explain my excitement\nwhen I \ufb01rst made this. I was inspired\nby a salad dish I saw on a cooking\nshow and I thought I should modify\nit a bit and give it a try. With no exaggeration this is the best starter you\ncan ever have since it is light and it\nhas unique \ufb02avours that are married\nso well together.\nIngredients:\n(Per portion)\n1 big aubergine\nFOOD\n15\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYiango Mavrocostanti wants to come\nand dine with you\u2026.\nI\n1 thick slice white bread\n5 cherry tomatoes\n1 tsp honey\n2 tbsp olive oil\n4 tbsp tahini dressing\nSalt and pepper to taste\nProcedure:\nPreheat your oven to 180\u00b0C. With\na fork, pierce the aubergine several\ntimes and place it in the oven as is\n(don\u2019t cut it) for about 40 minutes\nor until it is very soft. Then, remove\nthe skin from the aubergine and cut\nit in half lengthwise. Place the bread\nin the oven for a few minutes until it gets a very light brown colour\nand then place the tomatoes on top\nof the bread and return to the oven\nfor about 10 minutes. In the mean-time, combine the crushed garlic,\nsalt, pepper, olive oil and honey and\nset aside. When the bread is ready\nplace the aubergines on top and drizzle with the honey dressing and then\nwith the tahini dressing. Starter is\nready!\nTip: For the starter you will need\nabout 50 minutes. Be smart and bake\nthe aubergine in advance since this\nwill save you a lot of time!\nMain:\nPenne with homemade\nbasil pesto\nNow, who doesn\u2019t like pasta? This\ndish is a guaranteed success. Do not\nget scared by the homemade pesto.\nIt\u2019s super easy! I promise.\nIngredients:\n(Per portion)\n3\u20444 cup penne or spaghetti\n1\u20442 cup fresh basil\n100 grams cherry tomatoes\n1\u20444 cup olive oil\n1\u20442 clove garlic\nSalt and pepper to taste\nProcedure:\nTo make the pesto, simply place the\nbasil, oil, garlic, and salt and pepper in the blender and pulse until\nsmooth. If you don\u2019t have a blender\nthen chop the basil and garlic very\n\ufb01nely and then place them in a bowl\nand mix with the olive oil, salt and\npepper. Set the pesto aside and move\non to the pasta! In a pot, boil 1 litre\nof water, add the pasta and some salt.\nAfter 7 minutes (need to be exact!)\nremove the pasta and wash them\nwith cold water so that they will not\nstick together. In a non-stick pan put\nthe pesto and the whole cherry tomatoes and when it starts to get warm\nadd the pasta. Stir and let cook until the tomatoes become soft. Serve\nin a pasta bowl and add some fresh\nchopped basil on top!\nDessert:\nRich chocolate brownies\nChocolate for dessert. It might sound\ntypical but these brownies give this\nmeal a luxurious end. You have to try\nthem to understand!\nIngredients:\n1 cup \ufb02our\n1 cup sugar\n1\u20442 tsp salt\n1\u20442 cup cocoa powder\n1\u20444 cup chocolate chips\n1 tsp soda\n1 mashed banana\n1\u20444 cup roasted walnuts 1\u20444 cup oil\n3\u20444 cup milk\n2 tsp white wine vinegar Procedure:\nLightly grease a 9-inch pan (or smaller if you prefer them taller). Preheat\nyour oven to 180\u00b0C. In a bowl mix\nall the dry ingredients including the\nchocolate chips and in a separate\nbowl combine the wet ingredients\nincluding the banana. Then, combine\nthe wet with the dry ingredients and\nput the mixture in the pan. Bake until you insert a toothpick in the centre and comes out almost dry.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\n\u201c \u201d\n\u201c\nFarming for the future\nJennifer Mitchell discusseshowclimatechangewillimpactfarming\necently, I overheard\ntwo students in the Library Caf\u00e9 discussing\nthe potential e\ufb00ects of\nclimate change on what\nwe eat. \u201cCould you imagine? I mean\n\ufb01sh and bananas, yuk!\u201d They were\nreferring to a recent news article proposing that climate change will a\ufb00ect\nour crop production to the extent that\nwe will have to start replacing the potato in our diet with bananas. I didn\u2019t\nthink any more of this conversation\nuntil the next morning when I opened\nthe paper to the headline \u201cClimate\nchange threatens co\ufb00ee crops\u201d. Clearly this is not a good week for food.\nForget the displacement of millions of\npeople, an increase in severe weather\nevents and the associated loss of life.\nLosing 60% of our co\ufb00ee? Now that\u2019s\nserious.\nCertainly, agriculture was a reoccurring theme at the London Climate\nForum, which was hosted on Imperial\u2019s campus last weekend. Agriculture\nwill not only be severely a\ufb00ected by\nclimate change but it is also a major\ncontributor to the warming of our\nplanet in the \ufb01rst place. At least 30%\nof global greenhouse gas emissions\ncome from agriculture; for every one\nkcal of food we produce we consume\nnine kcals of fossil fuel.\nSpeaking at the forum Duncan\nWilliamson, senior policy advisor\nfor food at the World Wildlife Fund\n(WWF), described agriculture as \u201cthe\nbiggest environmental problem on\nthe planet\u201d and stated that \u201cthe global\nfood system is doing untold damage to\nour environment\u201d. It is true that many\nfarming practices are huge contributors to the build-up of greenhouse\ngasses in the atmosphere. Add to this\nthe amount of carbon released when\nforests are cleared to make room for\nfarmland and it\u2019s clear that we cannot\nsustain our current farming methods,\nnot without doing untold damage to\nthe environment anyway.\nThere is one huge problem that we\nhave in trying to combat this. By 2050\nthe world\u2019s population is predicted to\ngrow to around 9 billion, an increase\nof 2 billion people over the next forty\nyears. Hunger and malnutrition are\nstill the number one risks to human\nhealth worldwide, posing a greater\nthreat to human life than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. In\nfact, as I am writing this article there\nare at least 925 million undernourished people in the world. We can\u2019t\neven seem to feed the world\u2019s population as it stands, let alone 2 billion\nmore.\nR\n\u201d\nFor every ONE\nkcal of food\nwe produce\nwe consume\nNINE kcals of\nfossil fuel\nWhilst a lack of co\ufb00ee may seem\ntrivial in comparison to world hunger\n\u2014 and let\u2019s make no bones about it,\nit is \u2014 the loss of co\ufb00ee production\nserves to highlight serious knock-on\ne\ufb00ects that climate change is likely\nto have on global agriculture. And it\u2019s\nmore serious than a lack of morning\nca\ufb00eine \ufb01x. The export of co\ufb00ee is\ncrucial to the economies of countries\nsuch as Brazil and Ethiopia. So, the\nfact that co\ufb00ee is a highly climate-de-pendent crop means that an increase\nin global temperature of just a few degrees could put the livelihood of the\nmillions of people that grow and produce it at serious risk.\nCrops aren\u2019t the only aspect of our\nSonali Campion\nUrban food\nsystems: using community\nand rooftop\ngardens to reduce the miles\nfood has to\ntravel\nfood systems which are set to change\ndue to global warming, as pointed out\nby Trewin Restorick, the CEO of independent environmental charity Global Action Plan. In a speech discussing\nthe current state of climate change\nand sustainability he proposed that\nbusinesses around the Indian Ocean\nare having to adapt to the e\ufb00ect that\nclimate change is having upon marine\nlife. As the ocean is warming tuna are\nswimming lower down in the ocean\nand are consequently more di\ufb03cult to\ncatch. Whilst this may be good news\nfor tuna, it certainly isn\u2019t good news\nfor a number of global economies.\nIt\u2019s not all bad though; there are solutions that could help us to feed more\npeople whilst also doing less harm to\nour environment. After all, the objective of the London Climate Forum was\nnot to cast gloom and doom but instead challenge us to think about the\nways in which climate change can be\nprevented and ultimately overcome.\nThis is where a talk given by Duncan\nWilliamson (senior policy advisor for\nfood at the WWF) and Ed Dowling\n(Founder of Sustaination) provided\nsome valuable insight. In fact, the\ngood news is that there are too many\npossible solutions to write about in\nthis article. One solution that seems\nparticularly interesting, especially to\nus London-residing students, is the\ncreation of urban food systems. As Ed\npointed out, \u201cwhen you\u2019ve got more\nthan 50% of the world\u2019s population\nliving in cities it makes a lot of sense\nto grow food there as well.\u201d Community and rooftop gardens will reduce\nthe amount of miles that our food\ntravels and subsequently the amount\nof greenhouse gasses produced in its\ntransport.\nWatching what we eat is also going\nto be an important factor in reducing\nthe e\ufb00ects of agriculture on our envi-ronment. Eating less meat is certainly\na way to consume less fossil fuels\nwhilst also feeding more of the Earth\u2019s\npopulation. We already produce\nenough food to feed roughly 11 billion\npeople, so considering that the world\nis home to around 7 billion people we\nshould have enough food right? But\nthe fact is we don\u2019t. Many of the crops\nthat we grow end up feeding livestock\ninstead of people. Not only does this\nmean that we still have starving people in the world, it also considerably\ncontributes to climate change. Roughly 25 times more energy is required\nto produce one calorie of beef than\nto produce one calorie of corn. With\nroughly 2 billion more people to feed\nby 2050, it\u2019s time we started reconsidering our global food system.\nSo, as much as I jest about the prospect of a life without co\ufb00ee, and I\u2019ll be\nhonest I\u2019m still reeling from that one,\nLondon Climate Forum was a serious\nstatement. That our press should need\nto threaten us with co\ufb00ee withdrawal\nand chips made from bananas to get\nus to engage with climate change is\nabsurd. Fittingly, as I \ufb01nish this article the newspaper sports a picture of\nclimate change protesters in St Andrews. They hold a sign reading \u201cNature doesn\u2019t do bailouts\u201d. Time to refocus on climate change? I think so.\nglobalgiants.com\nImperial LeoSoc really has\ngone downhill recently...\nAgriculture: \u201cThe\nbiggest environmental\nproblem on the planet\u201d\nNumerous solutions,\nbut they need to be\nimplemented ASAP\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nJust the right Climate\nJames Beioley reviews the London Climate Forum\nhe London Climate Forum, in short, is a fascinating and cutting-edge\nforum which anybody interested in climate change\nand sustainability, and even those who\naren\u2019t, should endeavour to get involved with.\nFor those not clued up on this pro-ject, let me provide a brief summary.\nThe London Climate Forum is an entirely student-led conference based\nwithin Imperial College, and is the\nbiggest in London, and quite possibly\nthe country. It runs over just Saturday\nand Sunday, but o\ufb00ers up some serious clout with its multiple leading\nthinkers in the world of sustainability,\nall of whom grasp the opportunity to\nreach out to the new generation of\ngreen \u2018ecowarriors\u2019 in an attempt to\ninspire the next big thing(s).\nThe Forum\u2019s goal? To speak directly\nto those who are on the frontier of\nthe climate agenda whilst entertaining the chance that the solutions we\ndesperately seek may be nurtured\nwithin its walls. It\u2019s a modest goal to\nsay the least\u2026 and one which was in\nfull swing this weekend as the Forum\nwas expertly carried out. This is just\nsome of those insightful talks which\nscratched the surface of our sustainable future.\nDay One\nThe \ufb01rst day was mostly focused on\nthe present; what the current climate\nis doing, why it is doing this, what\nwe are currently (mostly not) doing\nto mitigate it, and how business is\nadapting. Two eminent and, I\u2019m sure\nthey wouldn\u2019t mind me saying this,\nhighly outspoken campaigners \ufb01lled\nthe morning, in the form of Tony Juniper and Tom Burke, the latter part of\na panel trio who, combined with the\nDirector of our very own Grantham\nInstitute, painted a rather desperate\npicture of a story we all have unfortunately come to know intimately.\nThe world is warming, we\u2019re respon-sible, 6oC is looking increasingly likely,\nand, all in all, politicians and society\nare doing sweet FA to even try \ufb01xing\nit, despite science\u2019s wild \ufb02apping of\narms and screaming in their collective faces. Trewin Restorick, CEO of\nthe Global Action Plan and the third\nspeaker of the trio bittersweetly delivered this when he stated how obviously blind the UK government is to\nbe ignoring PWC, a company he sarcastically described as \u201cknown for its\neco-radical behaviour\u201d. That got some\neducated laughs.\nThe Trillion Fund was next on the\nagenda, with Michael Stein, Founder\nand Director taking the stage, with\nexuberance and clear passion. Crowdfunding is his game and he knows\nwhat he\u2019s doing when it comes to\nmoney in the renewable sphere. He set\nthe scene with a succinct analysis of\nthe recent Arab Spring motion: \u201cHas\nanybody made the connection with\nclimate change and the Arab Spring? I\nhave \u2013 it\u2019s the \ufb01rst climate revolution\u201d\nwas his punchline piece, detailing how\nburnt-out Russian crops leading to\nrising food prices had more than likely\nbeen the trigger for the pouring over\nof a boiling pot of repression in the\nMiddle East.\nMichael sees the value in our online\nconnected world, and has begun utilising it to kickstart renewable projects\nworldwide, with the investing public\nnot only receiving sizable, and more\nimportantly reliable, returns (10-15%\nwas oft-quoted) but having the knowledge they had directly helped build a\nwind turbine or solar farm somewhere\nit is needed; think \u2018Kickstarter\u2019 but\nwith a renewable twist.\nMark Lynas, the infamously controversial but brilliant author of multiple\nclimate-related books and Guardian\ncolumns combined his views with the\ndeep technical knowledge of Prof. David MacKay of Cambridge, author of\nSustainable Energy: Without the Hot\nAir, a book I urge everybody to read,\nto produce what was a hysterical but\nadept analysis of our future UK energy mix. Using DECC\u2019s innovative\nenergy calculator, the two plugged in\nvarious parameters determining how\nmany solar panels here and how many\nEVs there (amongst 40 other options),\nwith the audience as an opinion poll,\nin their attempts to bring 2050 emissions levels to 80% of 1990 records,\nthe \u2018safe\u2019 zone.\nThey ran over, and we barely got it\n\ufb01nished, but the hilarity which ensued from Mark\u2019s quick and clever\ncomments and the astounding ambient knowledge of David provided a\nspectacle I, and I believe many oth-ers, could have watched for hours.\nIt would seem the only thing that\nwent truly wrong was the choice not\nto include any nuclear in the future\nmix, an apparent audience decision\nwhich shocked me and multiple oth-ers. \u201cDear God. Why did I allow it?\u201d\nMark later tweeted to me, a sentiment\nI wholeheartedly agree with.\nDay Two\nSunday was a day where futurists and\n\u2018blue-sky\u2019 thinkers could relish in their\nstudy of trends and solutions for the\ncoming 30 years, a day for \u2018what happens next\u2019.\nThe morning keynote set the scene,\nas James Cameron (not that one),\nFounder and non-executive Chairman\nof Climate Change Capital, member\nof GE\u2019s ecomagination board, advisor to government and so much more\nopened with some powerfully simple\nnotions. Sustainability is only going to\nwork if it is beautiful \u2013 \u201cnobody ever\nfeels punished standing in a green and\nenergy-e\ufb03cient building\u201d. His follow\nup point \u2013 green looks good the majority of the time, even if you subscribe\nto the belief that wind turbines are\nugly, and we feel good being around\nthem. It\u2019s an undeniable truth, and not\nsomething just reserved for the techy\ngeeks.\nInnovation, infrastructure and information were his three key in-need-of-improvement areas, all of them arising\nfrom his work within the UK, but undoubtedly applicable many times over\nelsewhere. Our infrastructure sucks,\nthere\u2019s no two ways of saying it, but if\nwe smarten it up in the endless ways\nwe could, we could become a leader in\ngreen energy worldwide, almost over-night.\nRight now, though, business regulations just aren\u2019t setup to accommodate\nnew players in the market, those that\nbring innovation to the table and undermine the outdated and bullish \u2018Big\nSix\u2019. If we can let go of this thinking,\nwho knows what fantastic new developments could become the norm. It\u2019s\nfairly common to hear that the UK has\nno real manufacturing base anymore,\nthat we e\ufb00ectively make nothing with\na British stamp on it, but James argues di\ufb00erently. He picked up on the\nautomotive industry, our passion for\nFormula 1, and our immense technical prowess in the materials sector. By\ncombining these powerhouses of business in new and sustainable ways, with\nthose young fresh-faced ideas behind\nit, the idea of the UK being dead in the\nwater on green issues is all but blown\naway.\nAnne Lise Kjaer went on to describe\nour disconnection with improving our\nquality of living and instead focusing\non more more more, whilst a talk on\nsustainable city planning explained\nhow green our 2012 Olympics really\nset out to be (and subsequently were).\nContaminated land was rejuvenated,\necologies sustained and innovative\nnew building techniques such as removable seating \u2018wings\u2019 on the Swimming Centre were employed, all within\na surprisingly tight budget. One structure went as far as being deconstructed and shipped to Rio for the next\nOlympics in a masterclass of recycling\nI personally have never seen before.\nAs the \ufb01nal day drew to a close, Jeremy Leggett, Professor Nigel Brandon\nand Dr Ling Ge tackled the future of\nenergy mixes and the technology we\ncould see directing us on a cleaner\npath, such as space-age battery stor-age, Solar Century PV projects and\nhydrogen deployment, as well as the\nbroader cost and social complications\nassociated.\n\u201cYou can ask any engineer to design\nyou a low-carbon energy system and\nthey could do it today without issue;\nit\u2019s just the cost which stops us\u201d was\nNigel\u2019s message to us all, and one that\nstrikes at the very heart of the prob-lem. However, it wasn\u2019t left at that,\nand as any good climate panel should\nit was argued fervently by Jeremy that\nit is the social and political willingness\nwhich is truly acting as the \ufb01nal nail.\nWe need more guts, more action and\nmore aggressive approaches if we are\nto bulldoze down the barriers in our\nway.\nOh, and Jeremy also compared what\nOsborne and his Treasury are doing\nright now in their blind love for shale\ngas as tantamount to treason... I am in\nsome ways inclined to agree.\nTo round it all o\ufb00, our resident Professor Lord Robert Winston brought a\nmeasure of class unlike any other, and\nproceeded to highlight how we must\nbe cautious of progress if we are to\nfully grasp its achievements and drive\nour society forwards. He left us with a\nsense of there coming a journey ahead,\nwhich will be simultaneously challeng-ing, depressing, at times catastrophic,\nbut all the while rewarding, a journey\nof which those fully invested in the notion of climate change are the pioneers\nstriving onwards. It\u2019s a feeling sorely\nmissing in much of the worldly debate,\nand one we as a society desperately re-quire.\nT\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\n6\nMark Lynas and David MacKay: just\nlike Laurel and Hardy, Morecambe\nand Wise, Keenan and Kel, you know,\nall the famous double acts\n\n"

The problem is easily \ufb01xed by\nsimply keeping installations up to date\nwhen asked to update (those annoying\n\u201cUPDATE NOW OR ELSE\u201d boxes).\nThe actual number of clubs that have\nbeen attacked seems to be small. The\nUnion Sys Admin, Philip Kent, said\nthat they are \u201cmaking sure everyone\nupdates so it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d He\nadded that all old Wordpress sites were\nnot necessarily attacked. He added that\nWordpress is not the \u201conly expoitable\npieve of software\u201d saying that \u201cother\nsoftware has security holes too, but we\nare targeting Wordpress on the basis\nthat it is widely used on club websites,\nand it has a poorer track record for being secure [than other software]\u201d.\nAt the moment, it would appear that\nthe content of the websites were altered but no sensitive information was\ncompromised.\nThe problem will be minimised by\nimmediately turning o\ufb00 a Wordpress\nthat is found to be outdated. It is only\nre-instated when it has been declared\nclean and the club has upgraded the\nsoftware. Since starting the weekly noti\ufb01cations a large number of clubs have\nalready upgraded their installations\nand Kent says the Union are \u201cwell on\nour way to fully resolving this problem\u201d.\nKent said that they have \u201cswitched\nevery site (except those which use custom domains) over to use SSL for all\naccess; which, while this will not stop\nthese kinds of attacks, it will prevent\nsome of the results of what is done\nto people\u2019s websites. For example, on\none website, the attackers modi\ufb01ed\nthe templates so that it displays what\nis called an iframe (embedding a website inside a website). Because we now\nrun under SSL, unless the website inside the iframe is also running under\nSSL, web browsers will often complain\nor refuse to show the contents of the\nframe, which may prevent showing of\nundesirable content. The same is true\nif they try to load external images or\nJavaScript.\u201d\nThey are also working on a way to\nmake upgrading easier, but are yet to\ncomplete it. There is a guide on the\nSysAdmin website (http://union.ic.ac.\nuk/sysadmin), which describes how to\nupgrade\nNah, I swear, Apple\nMaps will let me know\nwhere I am REALLY soon\nThe IC Crowd and/\nor an amazing\nRomCom promo shot\n\n"

Mr LawleyWakelin memorably interrupted Tony\nBlair with cries of \u201cThis man should\nbe arrested for war crimes\u201d while\nthe former Prime Minster was giving\nevidence at the Leveson enquiry.\nFollowing the combined e\ufb00orts of\ntwo policemen he was arrested under\nSection 5 of the Public Order Act.\nOn the morning of the hearing,\napproximately 30 stop the war\nprotestors along with members of\nthe press, gathered outside the court\nto support Mr Lawley-Wakelin\nand once again protest the ongoing\nrepercussions of the Iraq war. There\nwas a cynical suggestion that such a\nsmall court was selected to decrease\nthe platform for publicity. To further\ncompound this, the case was initially\nto be heard in a court with space for\n6 members of the public. After some\ngentle persuasion (and the mild threat\nof a sit-in) the case was moved to a\nlarger court.\nThroughout the proceedings the\nprosecutor called two witnesses\nSuperintendent Sean Walters and PC\nMark Seckham whilst Mr Wakelin\nhimself was the only witness for the\ndefence. In summary, on 28th May\n2012 Mr Wakelin planned to protest\nMr Blair\u2019s alleged war crimes on a\npublic platform during the Leveson\nenquiry. Having failed to enter by the\nfront door, he used the back entrance\nreserved for Judge Leveson and court\nsta\ufb00. The corridor leading up to this\ndoor was not guarded and the door\nwas unlocked. He then walked in and\nloudly stated \u201cExcuse me, this man\nshould be arrested for war crimes\u201d as\nwell as claiming that Tony Blair was\npersonally pro\ufb01ting \ufb01nancially from\nthe war. PC Mark Seckham and then SI\nSean Walters struggled to restrain Mr\nWakelin. Once they had removed him\nfrom the room, he soon calmed down\nand told o\ufb03cers \u201cI have done what I\ncame here to do and I will not be any\nmore trouble\u201d. Following transfer to\nBelgravia Police Station, Mr Wakelin\nwas detained until 2.35pm (by which\ntime Mr Blair had stepped down from\nthe witness stand) and his \ufb01le was\nmarked \u2018Not for Action\u2019. This was later\noverturned and he was summoned to\nHaringey Magistrates court.\nMr Wakelin was charged under\nSection 5 of the Public Order Act; the\nrelevant sections are as follows:\n1) A person is guilty of an o\ufb00ence if\nhe-a) Uses threatening, abusive or\ninsulting words or behaviour, or\ndisorderly behaviour\n3) It is a defence for the accused to\nprove-a) That he had no reason to believe\nthat there was any person within\nhearing or sight who was likely to be\ncaused harassment, alarm or distress,\nor\nc) That his conduct was reasonable\nThis must be balanced with article\n10 of the European Convention on\nHuman Rights which grants everyone\nthe freedom of expression subject\nto restrictions as ascribed by law.\nThis negotiation led to some comical\ndebate about whether people at the\nenquiry looked shocked/alarmed/\nsurprised/amused on the video clip\nof the main event as well as whether\nbeing described as a \u2018war criminal\u2019\nwould cause alarm or distress.\nAfter three hours of deliberation, the\njudge decided Mr Wakelin\u2019s behaviour\nhad been disordered and was likely to\nhave caused alarm or distress. Given\nhis unemployment (and a previous\ncaution for throwing urine at police\no\ufb03cers in 2003), he was \ufb01ned \u00a3100\nand asked to pay contributions of \u00a3250\nand a surcharge of \u00a315 at a rate of \u00a320\nper week. Following the judgement,\nMr Lawley-Wakelin gave a small\nspeech to the few members of the\npress who were present and read out\nan email of support from Reverend\nDesmond Tutu himself.\nAs well as providing some\namusing asides, this case provided\nanother opportunity to examine\nthe accusations against Tony Blair.\nOver the last decade, Blair has been\ndogged by allegations of misleading\nthe country into an illegal war\nalongside George Bush. This is further\ncompounded by the unstable situation\nin Iraq today which is now home to the\nlargest US embassy in the world and\nmany more armed private contractors\nthan there ever were soldiers.\nThe case is another in a growing\ntrend of high pro\ufb01le individual\nprotests such as Jonathan MayBowles\u2019 pie attack on Rupert Murdoch\nat a Commons committee hearing and\neven more controversially, Trenton\nOld\ufb01eld\u2019s interruption of the annual\nOxford-Cambridge boat race.\nThe timing was particularly relevant\nfor Stop the War Coalition who\nhosted a conference the following\nday entitled \u2018Media and War \u2013\nChallenging the consensus\u2019 (at\nGoldsmiths \u2013 obviously). Throughout\nthe day, journalists and activists\nran discussions on the failings (and\nsuccesses) of reporting on the ongoing\nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq \u2013 with\nLord Ashdown quoted that morning\nas saying \u201cThe only rational policy\nnow is to leave quickly, in good order\nand in the company of our allies. This\nis the only cause for which further\nlives should be risked\u2019. Given the\nescalation in violence recently, the\nstandard of reporting of the Palestine\nIsrael con\ufb02ict was also discussed.\nOne journalist for the \ufb01nancial times\nhighlighted their own headline that\nday as an example of reporting bias\n(\u201cGaza rocket \ufb01red at Jerusalem\u201d).\nThe \ufb01rst discussion of the day was\nentitled \u2018Serving the military or the\npublic? Covering the war on terror\u2019.\nOne of the panellists, Michelle\nStanistreet, General Secretary of the\nNational Union of Journalists, put\nforward suggestions for independent\nregulation of the media in order to\nprevent monopolies and ensure a high\nquality of press. In 2007, she led the\nNUJ chapel when the Daily Star tried\nto print \u2018The Daily Fatwa\u2019 \u2013 their crass\nimpression of what the esteemed\npaper would look like if the UK were an\nIslamic state. The hierarchal structure\nof large media companies render\njournalists powerless to challenge the\nestablished position of large papers,\nfor example until 2002 it has been\nreported that the Guardian had a\npolicy that \u2018protests are not news\u2019; this\nwas publicly revoked following the 2\nmillion strong protest to the Iraq war.\nThe conference aimed to provide\nconcrete suggestions for moving\nforwarded; these ranged from\nsimply having discussions with those\naround you, to writing for traditional\nmedia outlets as well as \u2018alternative\u2019\nmedia sources, contacting MPs and\ncontinuing the protests on the streets.\nThis advice was put into action this\nweekend at the jointly organised\nprotest in support of Gaza. Amongst\nothers, Stop the War coalition, the\nPalestinian Solidarity Campaign\nand the British Muslim Initiative\ncame together with an estimated\n10,000 supporters to march from\nDowning Street to the Israeli embassy\nin support of Gaza and to protest\nthe siege and blockade by Israel.\nThe atmosphere was charged and\nemotive with speeches by Tony Benn,\nLindsey German, Jeremy Corbyn\nMP, Andy Slaughter MP as well as\nManuel Hassassian, the Palestinian\nambassador. The success of the event\nwas hardly re\ufb02ected in the main\nstream media but the spirit was\nde\ufb01ant and hopeful that there will be a\nbrighter future for Palestine.\nO\nKelly Ameneshoa Writer\n\u2018Wrong man in the dock\u2019? \u2013 Media and War\nThe\nhierarchal\nstructure of\nlarge media\ncompanies\nrender\njournalists\npowerless to\nchallenge the\nestablished\nposition\nWait wait wait, slow down...\nWait wait wait, slow down...\nYou\u2019re telling me I can write for Felix Politics?\nYou\u2019re telling me I can write for Felix Politics?\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nABC\nA weekend of Stop the War ACTIVITIES\n\n"

Whilst visiting\nhis parents\u2019 gravesites, he is ambushed\nby an escaped convict (Fiennes) who\no\ufb00ers him a chance to live in exchange\nfor some food, drink, and a \ufb01le to grind\naway his shackles. Scared out of his\nwits, Pip has no problem accepting\nthis scary man\u2019s o\ufb00er. The prisoner is\nsubsequently arrested again by the au-thorities, and Pip thinks nothing more\non the matter.\nAnother encounter sees the young\nPip inside the run-down mansion of\nMiss Havisham (Carter), who wants\na boy of a similar age to her daughter\nEstella to keep the young girl enter-tained. Miss Havisham insists in staying locked away at her estate, forever\nwearing her wedding dress in memory\nof her botched nuptial plans years ago.\nEven at an alarmingly young age, Pip\nfalls head over heels for Estella who is\nbeing groomed by Miss Havisham to\nbecome quite the heartbreaker in the\nfuture, to be used as a twisted vessel of\nrevenge against the male sex that the\nwronged Miss Havisham cunningly\ndesires.\nKnowing that Pip is only destined to\nbe a blacksmith\u2019s apprentice, he is torn\naway from Estella very early on. Years\nlater he (Irvine) is informed that he has\ncome into a large fortune thanks to a\nmysterious benefactor whose identity\nmust remain anonymous and is to become a gentleman. Now that he\u2019s got\nthe money and class, he visits the one\nperson he could not forget all those\nyears. Yes, Estella (Grainger) has all\ngrown up too, but it would appear her\nheartbreaking ways have not changed\none bit.\nJust why Pip is so hung up on a girl\nlike this is anyone\u2019s guess, and to say\nthat it\u2019s all down to her beauty isn\u2019t a\nsatisfactory enough answer given how\nmuch time is devoted to the two of\nthem arguing about love with Pip re-petitively proclaiming his undying feelings for her. There must be something\nmore, but the \ufb01lm fails to look further\ninto the development of their attrac-tion. Irvine, still a fresh-face rising star\nafter War Horse fares a lot better here,\nas he has plenty more material and\nricher substance to process.\nUptight, proper and a \ufb01rst-class bitch\nat times, Grainger is highly e\ufb00ective as\nthe cold and distant Estella, although at\ntimes she is also successful in putting\non the face of longing whenever Pip is\nin the picture. She and Irvine make a\nfascinating screen duo, and the prickly,\nacid-tongued actress provides a nice\ncontrasting balance to the more sensitive Irvine.\nBut the two outstanding performances come from the two expected\nindividuals, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of\nBritish acting royalty, Carter and Fiennes. Carter, in a role that suits her\nperfectly, fully embraces her dark,\ngothic and mysterious Miss Havisham\nwho is clearly su\ufb00ering from severe\npsychological damage. She is so good\nin fact in her frighteningly huge and\ndirtied white dress, that she gives all\nthe previous Miss Havishams a run for\ntheir money. Her scenes are always fun\nto watch, as she delightfully chews the\nscenery, which is why her dramatic end\nfeels even more tragic. Fiennes does\nmake a welcome return in the \ufb01lm, and\nhis gritty look works well although his\nconnection to Pip is not well estab-Great Expectations\nDirector: Mike Newell\nScreenwriters: David Nicholls,\nCharles Dickens (novel)\nStarring: Jeremy Irvine, Ralph\nFiennes, Helena Bonham Carter,\nHolliday Grainger\nJohn Park Film Editor\nTrouble with the Curve\nDirector: Robert Lorenz\nScreenwriter: Randy Brown\nStarring: Clint Eastwood, Amy\nAdams, Justin Timberlake\nAren\u2019t you tired of this same old for-mula? Once again, we get an underdog\nsports movie (baseball\u2026yawn\u2026) that\ncarves out its path the minute the lead\ncharacter is introduced. Once again,\nwe see the ageing Clint Eastwood\nplaying a grumpy man with snarky\noutbursts and failing health or to put\nmore simply, channelling what he did\nin Gran Torino. Once again, Amy Adams \ufb01lls the role of a charming, adorable female, this time as Eastwood\u2019s\ndaughter. Once again, singer-turned-serious-actor Justin Timberlake eases\ninto the role of a cheeky young love\ninterest.\nThere is dysfunctional family drama\nas the father and daughter are es-tranged. She is a career-driven city\ngirl, seeking the approval of her distant father. He pushes her away for the\ncorny, cheesy reasons explained in a\nteary expos\u00e9 given by the usually stern\nfather. It\u2019s supposed to be all the more\ntouching as he\u2019s not the kind of guy\nto get touchy feely with his emotions.\nAnd also guess what happens when\nthe uptight city lawyer meets the fun-loving, free-spirited country boy. She\nbegins to smile, she begins to laugh,\nand fully embraces the country girl\nwithin; because no-one can be happy\nworking in the city wearing suits all\nday hounded by our nasty bosses to\nmeet all the project deadlines.\nBut in a strange way, director Lorenz, a frequent Eastwood collaborator\nin his feature \ufb01lm directorial debut,\nmakes certain aspects work, and even\nwith all the tiresome narrative pitfalls\nthe script doesn\u2019t even bother to try\nto avoid, there are scenes of genuine\ntender-hearted emotions as the actors\nfully engage in what they do best with\na sugar-coated, easy-going narrative\nthat bombards us with optimism, but\nthe many, many \ufb02aws and lazy storytelling often threaten to jeopardise the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s good and honest intentions.\nHaving to deal with declining health\nis never an easy task for anyone, especially for someone who prefers to\nbe alone in his quiet life. Working as\na baseball scout who refuses to modernise his ways with computers and\nelectronic data analysis opting instead\nto watch the live games of various\nplayers, Gus (Eastwood) faces a non-renewal of his scouting contract as\nthe big bosses aren\u2019t convinced by his\nold ways. His stubborn nature won\u2019t\nlet him do otherwise, and his worried friend Pete (John Goodman) enlists the help of Gus\u2019 daughter Mickey\n(Adams) who is also a baseball whizz\nherself knowing all sorts of facts and\ntrivia about the sport. The relationship between the two has never been\neasy, with Mickey blaming her father\nfor her emotional problems that a\ufb00ect\nher personal life. Her father\u2019s been\ndistant. She therefore doesn\u2019t trust\nmen. Classic soapy story that\u2019s been\ndone hundreds of times over. Enter\nJohnny (Timberlake), a fellow scout,\nhaving nothing but respect for Gus\nand a keen pair of eyes for Mickey.\nWhen it comes to dealing with the\nbaseball aspect of the story, it often\nfares worse than the human drama.\nGus knows everything there is to\nknow. He knows every single kind\nof pitching there is in baseball, and\ntherefore puts him a class above all\nthe \u201cinterweb\u201d (how original)-ob-sessed suits. And guess who comes\nout triumphant in the end. Plus there\nare the obligatory build-ups and slow-motion \ufb01nales to really lay everything\non thickly. Subtlety is certainly not\none of the \ufb01lm\u2019s features and the ending su\ufb00ers greatly because of it. For a\nhuman/sports drama wanting to be\ntaken seriously, it takes one too many\neasy routes to tie everything up, greatly diminishing whatever dramatic impact it could have had, drowning it all\nout with too much sap.\nBut the overall results can be described as a heart-warming experi-ence, thanks mostly to Eastwood\ndoing what he often does best. His\nextreme irritable mood and coldness\ntowards his own daughter are personality traits that may seem incomprehensible at times, but for a man who\ndoesn\u2019t want to accept the fact that\nhis body is not the way it\u2019s used to be,\nthere is a fair amount of sympathy to\nbe aroused and the \ufb01lm cashes in on\nevery moment to capture his ailing\nhealth. And no matter how heartbreaking it may be to see Dirty Harry\nshed some tears over his dead wife,\nwas it really essential to have him sing\n\u201cYou are my sunshine\u201d by her grave-side?\nDue to the many bumps and annoying audience-insulting moves\nalong the way, the overall result seems\nunderwhelming. But with a cast\nthis good, performing only to their\nstrengths and with a guilty-pleasure\nelement attached to the underdog\nstory, you\u2019ll almost forgive its sluggish\nstyle with which it chooses to pitch its\nstory.\nlished enough to fully convince.\nIt has a lot to juggle around, and this\nis where the \ufb01lm often falls spectacularly apart. There are so many charac-ters, events and back stories to squeeze\ninto a tight frame that often these are\nglossed over and sometimes in clum-sy, rushed \ufb02ashbacks that don\u2019t tell us\nenough. And then there\u2019s the ending \u2013\nDickens wrote two versions but without spoiling which route the \ufb01lm decides to take, let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t end\non the most satisfying note. As often\nis the case when books are transferred\nonto the screen, a lot is lost in transla-tion, an aspect not even the excellent\nperformances or costly production design can truly salvage.\nClint keeps an eye on his swinging balls..\nI DOOOOOOO\nYou\u2019re not working on any more albums are ya...punk?\n\n"

Imperial Fencing Women\u2019s 1st park the\nminibus and make their way through\nthe labyrinth-like venue to find the\nfencing piste. On the schedule for\nthe day are Oxford and Cardiff University, ranked last and middle of the\nleague respectively. Are the Imperial\ngirls going to continue their incredible streak of victories?\nIt all starts with sabre against Oxford. Jing Xiao (Jingles), Emma Horrix and team captain Zoe Robinson\ndance up and down the piste, continuously extending the lead until the\nscore is 45-27 and the match is over.\nThe epeeists step up next, ready to\nextend the lead even further. However, Oxford isn\u2019t giving up that eas-ily, and they keep an advantage of a\nfew hits at the start.\nAs they reach the end of the first\nhalf, Imperial\u2019s Caitlin Jones and Kat\nYoung decides that enough is enough\nand from there turn it around to\nImperial\u2019s lead, and together with\nCharlotte Levin keep it all the way\nto 45-37.\nWith two weapons fenced, Imperial is ahead by 26 hits and the girls\nquickly calculate that they need to\nscore 19 hits in foil to win overall.\nDespite Oxford being the clearly\nstronger team in the weapon, Zoe,\nCharlotte and Alice Mitchell together manage to pick point after point,\nending at 23-45 and an aggregate\nscore of 113-109. One down, one to\ngo!\nFacing a home team is always more\nchallenging. Cardiff also has different strengths than Oxford, and the\nweapon order had been reversed.\nStarting off with foil, Zoe, Charlotte\nand Alice stay on piste and make\nevery hit count. Similar to the epee\nmatch against Oxford, Cardiff starts\nby taking the lead.\nBut once again, Imperial proves\nthat they\u2019re top of the league for a\nreason, and half way through the\nlead has swapped sides and stays like\nthat until the very end when Imperial loses by a single hit. Ironically,\nthe epeeists repeated what the foil-ists just did almost identically: Cardiff takes the lead at the start, Imperial takes it back half way through\nbut then lose by that single hit that is\nan athlete\u2019s worst nightmare.\nIf there had been any doubts previously about who would stand victorious at the end of this match, it\nquickly faded during sabre. Imperial had to win by 3 hits to secure\nthe victory, and the sabreurs did not\ndisappoint; 71 hits later, 45 of which\nwere Imperial\u2019s and 26 Cardiff\u2019s, the\nmatch was over. Overall the result\nwas 133-116 and the girls could return to the minibus in a good mood,\nand celebrate all the way back to\nLondon.\nFencers Continue Winning Streak\nCharlotte Levin Sports Writer\nICHC Mens 2\u2019s Crush Portsmouth\nA dark and windy November evening\nsaw the men\u2019s 2s head out to Harlington\nto take on a formidable Portsmouth 3s.\nWith our captain Jimmy S, out injured\ndue to a broken hand, coaching from\nthe sidelines, ICHC got stuck in straight\nfrom the \ufb01rst whistle. To say the \ufb01rst\nhalf was a one sided a\ufb00air would be\nharsh on Imperial: it was a master class.\nOften this season the IC have started slow and given their opposition a\nchance to establish themselves but\nright from the o\ufb00 IC found themselves\ncamped deep inside the Portsmouth\nhalf. Playing with a narrow mid\ufb01eld, the\nfull backs, B.Man and Meat Spin, were\ngiven licence to bomb down both wings\ndelivering ball after ball into the opposition D. The IC centre back, Tinkerbell,\nfound himself playing in his newly invented role of creative defender which\nsaw him camped deep inside the oppositions 25 and entrusting Soggy Biscuit\nto do any defensive work in his absence.\nTo try to counteract the IC threat,\nPortsmouth started to play 11 in de-fence. With the 25 packed out, it was\nalmost impossible for IC to carve out\nany sort of shooting opportunity but it\ndid allow the winning of several short\ncorners in quick succession. Cummy B,\nwho on Sunday found his drag \ufb02icking\nrange, stepped up con\ufb01dently but the\nPortsmouth keeper was equal to the\nchallenge. Following short corner routines lacked the 2s usual cutting edge\nand several chances went begging.\nAs half time rapidly approached, IC\nhad nothing to show for their domi-nance. The 2s were looking for inspiration that even Strap-\u201cWhy can I\nonly score wonder goals\u201d-on couldn\u2019t\nprovide. It took a fresher of all people\nto step up and provide that clinical\ntouch that IC were missing. Good work\nfrom the power house that is Old Man\nMikey helped to create some space in\nthe oppositions D and, as a bouncing\nball found its way into the dangerzone,\nFresher Jay-Zed was on hand to ri\ufb02e the\nball home into the roof of the net on the\nstroke of half time.\nThe second half saw desperation\nhit Portsmouth and they changed\ntheir system to try to put more pressure on the IC defence. Playing with a\nhigh man, they resorted to aerials and\nbig hit and hopes from defence but IC\nstayed strong and ball after ball was cut\nout laying the foundation for more IC\nattacks. Whilst the Portsmouth high\nmen created much more space for IC to\nplay some champagne hockey (despite\nFresher Alex not knowing where the\nside of the pitch was\u2026 3 times\u2026), they\nalso put the IC defence under increased\npressure. Despite having had nothing\nto do for 50 minutes, goalie, Sifter, was\ncalled into action with a re\ufb02ex save at\nhis near post from a rare Portsmouth\nforay into the IC D.\nSoon after IC got the second goal they\nthoroughly deserved. After peppering\nthe Portsmouth keeper with numerous\nshots, Fresher Jay-Zed got his second\ngoal of the game after Fresher Mark,\nFresher Tim and Wrong Hole combined to give him the easiest of \ufb01nishes.\nJust when IC were looking like they\nmight put 5 or 6 goals away, they went\ndown to 10 men after Old Man Mikey\nshoulder charged a Portsmouth mid\ufb01elder in the face. Whilst he protested\nthat it was an accident and he simply\nslipped (no one believes him but he did\nmake it look rather convincing), the\numpire was having none of it and o\ufb00\nhe went for a 10 minute cool down in\nthe bin. Portsmouth attempted to seize\ntheir opportunity and drive forwards\nbut all they could muster were two penalty corners, one which was useless and\nthe other that was saved by Sifter low\nto his left.\nThe \ufb01nal whistle soon followed leaving Fresher Jay-Zed stranded just shy of\nhis hat trick and IC having no regrets\nbut wishing they had translated their\ndominance into a larger score line and\nready to enjoy the Harlington showers.\nThe 2s will be looking to kick on from\nthis dominant display of crisp passing\nand wondrous stick skills with a busy\nschedule ahead of them.\nJust to clarify, at no point did Brickney score a goal, but that\u2019s ok because\napparently strikers aren\u2019t meant to\nscore.\nJonney Clowes Sports Writer\nThis coming Sunday Imperial College\nHockey Club\u2019s men\u2019s 2nd XI have a LUSL\ncup tie against King\u2019s College London\u2019s\n1st XI. Our boys are undoubtedly the\nunderdogs, but even so it was a surprise\nfor our men\u2019s captain to receive the following email from the KCL captain this\nweek:\n\u201c\u2026it\u2019s regarding our upcoming LUSL\ncup fixture with you this Sunday. (As I\nsaid to him) it\u2019s hard for this not to come\nacross as presumptuous and arrogant\nbut we played your 1s yesterday and\nbeat them 4-0 with a weakened squad.\nI really don\u2019t want this to sound boastful\nas to be honest it was nothing special;\nI gave our lads a real bollocking at half\ntime and it was only towards the end\nthat we pushed on and put some more\npast them. However, without wanting\nto slag off your team, I think in all likelihood the result will go the same way this\nweekend, especially seeing as we\u2019ll be\nback to full strength. I hope this isn\u2019t offensive and if you do or don\u2019t agree then\ngive me a shout. Cheers\u201d\nYes, undoubtedly arrogant. But there\nare two things that strike me about this\nemail a little more than that.\nThe first is the assumption that we\u2019d\nrather give in than face a tough chal-lenge. Well you may as well quit your\ndegree right now if that is your attitude,\nas I can tell you that no course at Imperial is easy. Surely this is the crux of a cup\ncompetition; the chance for an upset?\nAnd even if we don\u2019t win, as any sports\nperson will attest, there is a great deal of\nsatisfaction in playing a match well, and\nimproving your performance.\nMy second observation is that this\nemail does not demonstrate good\nsportsmanship. Sportsmanship is about\nattitude and at the very least includes respect for your opposition. I\u2019m proud to\nsay our response was a little more dignified,andIthinkreflectsthehockeyclub\u2019s\nattitude towards our sport:\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t take this offen-sively. If you are asking for a walkover\nhowever, then my answer is categorically no. We give everything to the game\nand love playing it, so regardless of what\nyou may think the result may be, we will\ncompete hard. See you on Sunday.\u201d\nSo for our men\u2019s 2nd XI, but also for\nany other Imperial teams out there this\nweekend in the cold (and probably wet)\nplaying the sports you love, good luck.\nAnd remember, the bigger they are, the\nharder they fall.\nMaria Parkes Hockey Club Captain\nIs Winning Really Everything?\n\n"

With\n\ufb01ve hundred people competing, it is\nthe biggest duathlon event in the coun-try. Hosted at the iconic Castle Combe\nrace track, athletes get to \ufb02y around a\ntrack that has held motoring events for\nover 60 years, and holds a great sense of\nspeed. One blessing of the race is that it\nkicks o\ufb00 at 1:20pm; a civilised time we\nwere very grateful of after the 8am start\nof the Hillingdon Duathlon just weeks\nbefore.\nWe set o\ufb00 from uni, managing to\n\ufb01t nine people \u2013 with bags and bikes\n\u2013 into one minibus. With two people\ntaking the train, and two more making\ntheir own way there, we had a thirteen\nperson team. Sam O\u2019Neill and Hendrik\nFrentrup deserve a special mention\nfor driving us to the race and back, so\nthanks guys! Due to Lucas Miseikis\nturning up nearly an hour late however,\nwe had to quickly register when we ar-rived, set our bikes in the transition\nzone and have a short warm up. It was\ntime to get our game faces on for race\nstart.\nDue to torrential rain the previous\nweek, parts of the course were still water logged, and despite the best e\ufb00orts\nof local Bristolians and their buckets,\nthe water wasn\u2019t going anywhere. This\nmeant a change in the course, which\ndidn\u2019t bother me as I had no idea where\nwe were meant to be going anyway! We\nset o\ufb00, and it was clear the standard this\nyear was serious. A pack of runners in\nGBR kit took the lead immediately, disappearing o\ufb00 in to the distance as I was\nleft in the bottom twenty runners. Just\nto tease us, the \ufb01rst run consisted of\na mile run out, and a mile back to the\ntransition zone. This meant that I could\nwatch all the people running the other\nway, already building a substantial lead\nwhile I was still going away from the \ufb01nish line. But this was to be expected, I\nam a slow runner.\nIt was then into transition and onto\nthe bike. With a swift T1 (transition 1)\nof 38 seconds, I had already made up a\nfew places; I am a cyclist after all, and\nwith the thrill of being on Castle Combe\nrace track urging me on, I was moving\nup the rankings well. The long sweeping corners meant there was no need to\nstop pedalling. You would just get your\nbody low, lean in to the corner, pedal\nyour heart out and get as close to the\nwet white lines at the side of the track as\nyou dared. Hugh Mackensie (our fastest competitor) stormed past me on his\nbike, already lapping people, him and\nthe front runners were 4-5 minutes in\nfront by now. The sound of a triathlon\nbike carving up your right hand side,\nthe carbon wheels resonating with the\nunrelenting speed they are being forced\nto spin at. It is a surreal sound, and I\nhope one day to hear that noise from\nmy own bike!\nAfter a death defying hairpin bend to\nget into the transition zone again, I was\no\ufb00 my bike sooner than I would have\nliked, and onto the run. I had overtaken\na lot of people including three Imperial\ncompetitors on the bike leg, and knew\nit was only a matter of time before they\ncaught me again on this run. A gruelling \ufb01nal 2 miles tests you\u2019re ability to\nshift disciplines quickly. The second\nrun went in a new direction, over the\ngrass and up a short incline where the\ncombination of jelly legs and poor grip\ncaused me to stumble and slip my way\nup the course. Eventually we were back\non tarmac (\ufb02ooded tarmac), and I was\nwaiting for the \ufb01rst Imperial Triathlete\nto jog past me and say \u201cHi Ed\u201d smugly as\nthey over took. It was Richard Flint. \u201cHi\nEd\u201d he said predictably as he went by. I\nwanted to say something smug back but\nbetween clutching my burning abs and\ntrying to get enough oxygen in me to\nkeep going, there wasn\u2019t the time.\nWith 800m to go, it was Marcus\nBishop\u2019s turn. \u201cHi Ed\u201d he said, almost\nas if they had planned it from the start.\nI could see the \ufb01nish; I could see the\nback of Marcus\u2019s head bobbing away up\nthe course in front of me. At that point\nI decided to man up and locked onto\nMarcus\u2019s right \ufb02ank with 400m to go.\nHe could hear me behind him and he\u2019d\npicked up the pace. 200m to go and we\nboth broke out into a full sprint up the\n\ufb01nish line, neither of us wanting to let\nit go, but I just had him, pipping him\nthrough the gates by a second. With my\ngoal achieved, I threw my dignity to the\nwind and proceeded to puke up against\nthe railings four times.\nAfter regrouping with the team \u2013 hot\nchocolate in hand \u2013 we shared race\nresults and learnt that we had done\nexceptionally well. Hugh Mackenzie\ndid Imperial proud with 12th place, a\nsensational achievement. Sam O\u2019Neill\nrocked in with a 39th place, closely\nfollowed by Jean-Claude Besse who\ndespite su\ufb00ering a double puncture in\nthe bike stage still managed to \ufb01nish in\n40th. I came 168th. Nothing by the fast\npeople\u2019s standards but a great success in\nmy books, because I \ufb01nished in the top\nhalf! Other notable \ufb01nishes were Hendrik Frentrup in 80th and Kees Jan de\nVries in 94th; both competitors new to\nthe world of triathlons.\nPost-race, we headed out for a well-deserved pub dinner and a pint in Chippenham, followed by the incredibly well\nreceived homemade \ufb02apjacks Harriet\nNerva had brought. She knows the way\nto a man\u2019s heart. Now that the race was\nover, everyone\u2019s nerves had gone and\nthe tense pre-race atmosphere had\nlifted. Especially from Sophie Kirk, who\nbarely said a word before the race due\nto worries about her premiere duathlon.\nComing away from today without any\nBUCS points is always a disappoint-ment, but we had a solid race, with a\ngreat team of guys; we showed everyone that Imperial is becoming a serious\ncompetitor they\u2019ll be looking out for us\nat the next event.\nEd Hallet Triathlon Chairman\nAfter a good summer break, the Imperial Men\u2019s Cricket Club began gearing up for their Indoor cricket Season.\nAfter some rigorous training sessions,\nthe team felt con\ufb01dent heading into\ntheir \ufb01rst two games of the season on\nthe 20th of October against the University of Hertfordshire and University of Essex.\nBowling \ufb01rst against Hertfordshire,\nthe Imperial bowlers at times erred o\ufb00\nthe mark, allowing the Hertfordshire\nbatsmen a few too many boundaries.\nAlthough Jayanth Ganapathy bowled\ntightly and Joe O\u2019 Gorman stemmed\nthe \ufb02ow of runs at the end with 2\nwickets, the Hertfordshire batsmen\nnotched up a total of 119.\nChasing 119, the openers got o\ufb00 to\na good start, scoring 35 in 3 overs. After losing two quick wickets, Anmol\nBedi and Jayanth kept the chase well\non track, scoring 30 and 18 respec-tively. Well poised at 68 in 6 overs,\nVignesh Venkateswaran played a\nhandy cameo, scoring 24, leaving Imperial with 9 runs to score in the last\nover. However, with 4 wickets falling\nin a very tight \ufb01nal over, Imperial felt\nshort by 5 runs.\nIn the second game, Imperial, being put in to bat \ufb01rst notched up a respectable total of 131 in 10 overs. The\nopeners Joe and Vishal Nair provided\na blazing start by racing o\ufb00 to 52 in\n4 overs. Retiring after scoring 25 runs\neach, the middle order took over from\nthe openers, with the captain Jayanth steadily keeping the scoreboard\nticking. At 93 in 7 overs, the perfect\nplatform was set for Anmol to carve\ninto Sussex\u2019s death bowlers bringing\nImperial to a \ufb01nal total of 131.\nDefending 131, the Imperial bowlers applied the pressure on the Essex\nbatsmen from the onset. The e\ufb00ect\nwas immediate, with 2 wickets falling in consecutive balls in the second\nover. This initiated the Essex collapse,\nwith the Imperial \ufb01elders complimenting the bowlers to e\ufb00ect 4 run\nouts, eventually bowling Essex out for\n80.\nWith 5 games to go, these games\nprovided lots of con\ufb01dence to the Imperial team. Learning from their mis-takes, and by executing precise strategies practiced in training the team\nwas con\ufb01dent they could overcome\nfuture hurdles.\nThe second round of the BUCS indoor cricket tournament was held on\n18th of November. Needing two wins\nto remain contenders for a spot at the\ntop of the ladder, Imperial College\nwere \ufb01xed for two matches against\nRoyal Holloway and the University of\nWestminster.\nImperial won the toss and elected to\nbat \ufb01rst against Royal Holloway. After\na run-out in the \ufb01rst few balls, Mohit\nKulkarni consolidated with 32 runs\nand Jayanth held fort at the other end\nwith 28 runs, leaving Imperial with\na defendable total of 121. Imperial\u2019s\nbowlers kept it tight from the start,\nputting pressure on Royal Holloway\nand leaving spinners Vignesh, with 2\nwickets, and Joe to tidy up and lead\nImperial to a convincing win by 76\nruns.\nComing o\ufb00 this, Imperial batted\n\ufb01rst against a respectable Westminster bowling attack. Opener Vishal set\nthe benchmark with a classy 26 followed by Mohit why added a further\n31 and Jayanth progressing the score\nby 27 to bring the \ufb01nish up at 5/113\nafter the 10 overs. Full of conviction\nfrom the \ufb01rst win, Imperial\u2019s pace attack started o\ufb00 solidly with the spinners Vignesh, taking 3 2 wickets, and\nJoe, with 2 wickets, mimicking the\ninitial performance leaving Imperial\nwith another resounding 49 run win.\nImperial are now placed second on\nthe ladder, with three tough games\nagainst Middlesex, East London and\nBrunel in the \ufb01nal round. With the\nstrength and performance shown to\ndate, the team is hoping to top the table and qualify for the next round!\nIndoor Cricket through to 3rd round\nJayanth Ganapathy1st Team Captain\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\nJason Reitman\u2019s third directorial effort (after Thank you for Smoking and\nmy ever-favourite Juno) establishes\nhim as one of Hollywood\u2019s talents and\nalso creates another nepotism case\n(his father is director Ivan Reitman,\nof Ghostbusters and Dave fame, who\nalso serves as producer for this mov-ie). He tells the story of Ryan Bingham\n(George Clooney), a successful corporate downizer and a motivational\nspeaker \u2013 who motivates people to\nlive their life independent from rela-tionships, a lifestyle he enjoys to prac-tice. Willingly alienated, Ryan\u2019s biggest\nambition is to reach his 10,000,000 air\nmiles goal. In one of his stops he meets\nAlex (Vera Farmiga) an equally cynical\nand attractive woman, with whom he\ncreates a \u201cno strings attached\u201d rela-tionship, something \u2013 initally \u2013 ideal\nfor him.\nRyan\u2019s world starts to fall apart when\nthe keen, freshly Ivy League graduate,\nNatalie (Anna Kendrick is a revelation\nhere) is hired in the same company as\nhim and with a breakthrough proposal\nshe threatens to demolish Ryan\u2019s lifestyle for good.\nThis is a kind of prophetical \ufb01lm \u2013\nthe screenplay is adapted by a 2001\nnovel by Walter Kim, and was written\nin the same year by Sheldon Turner\nand was purchased by DreamWorks\nin 2003. Then the Reitmans found out\nabout it, which resulted to its 2009 release by Paramount, right in the feast\nof world \ufb01nancial crisis.\nNo one can deny that Clooney is one\nof the \ufb01nest American actors \u2013 or, bet-ter, artists. His big range, combined\nwith his dashing looks, allow him to\nportray his character honestly and\ngives us the whole emotional journey\nfrom a man who voluntarily isolates\nhimself to one who is in need of human contact and back. Ryan is de\ufb01nitely an unlikable character, an yet we\nroot for him. He makes scene where\nhe reaches his initial goal is equally\nfunny, thought-provoking and sad and\nat the end, he seems to be less than the\ndouche I thought him to be.\nVera Farmiga, his female counter-part, does more that the job of keeping herself against a strong lead. She\nmanages to deliver a performance that\nmakes the audience both love and hate\nher, creates the essential anti-heroine\nwho could be a man\u2019s rising \u2013 and\nends up becoming his demise.\nThe revelation of the \ufb01lm, though, is\na certain Kendrick. In the likes of Annette Bening, she brings a sassy and\nbreezy Natalie, full of the \u2013 sometimes\nThis is one scary movie\nunreal \u2013 ambitions and insecurities of\na girl of her age and education. You\nenjoy seeing her rising against her\n\u201cmentor\u201d (the scenes they share are\nsome of the best of the movie) as well\nas falling apart.\nSome of the best acting, though, occurs by the \ufb01red people. Reitman infamously used people that have been\n\ufb01red sometime in their life in order\nto deliver a more realistic result. The\nscenes where Natalie and Ryan \ufb01re\nBob (J.K. Simmons) and where Natalie\n\ufb01res via videocall Mr. Samuels (Steve\nEastin) are among the most powerful\nof the \ufb01lm.\nThe opening scene of the movie,\ncombined with the song, is an ironic\nwink to what America portrays. It gets\nyou to the point right before the actual\nmovie begins. The irony of the song\nabout a country that seemingly o\ufb00ers\neverything, and yet it failed its people\nso badly.\nThe choice of the colours of the\nmovie for the most part \u2013 blue and\ngreyish \u2013 re\ufb02ect pretty much Ryan\u2019s\nlife and psychism. Only in few scenes,\nlike Ryan and Alex\u2019s meeting and at\nthe family gathering, the atmosphere\nbecomes warmer, and you suspect\nthat the protagonist\u2019s soul gets a similar e\ufb00ect.\nAs with Juno, the direction is yet\nagain fresh and contemporary and\nthe dialogue is natural and brisk and\nthere\u2019s where lies a lot of the movie\u2019s\ncharm. As mentioned above, Reitman does not only rely on his leads,\nbut to the full cast (which includes the\ntalents of Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Zach Gali\ufb01anakis, and Melanie\nLynskey) to deliver a strong result.\nFinally, the image Reitman creates\nfor America is far from idyllic. Even\nthough Natalie is apparently chasing\nher piece of the American dream, only\nto realise that this is hardly doable,\nshe does it through the non-ideal way.\nThere are no pretty, lush valleys or\nbeautiful, luxurious houses. There are\ncold hotel rooms, even colder, wintery\ntowns and empty o\ufb03ces, ready to get\nrid of even more souls.\nAs the last two years pass by it becomes even more painful to watch this\nmovie, in a way. At its \ufb01rst viewing, it\nwas a movie about someone\u2019s isola-tion. As our world progresses into a\nkind of demise, it becomes, \u201ca scary\nmovie\u201d. Scary because people like\nRyan Bingham exist and do the job he\ndoes. As someone in the movie said,\nit makes me wonder how such people\ncan sleep at night. But every single\ntime I watch the \ufb01lm the same question comes up: How do you \ufb01re someone like Ryan Bingham?\nDespoina Paschou Film Writer\nSir Anthony Hopkins, winner of the\nAcademy Award for Best Actor for his\nportrayal of Hannibal Lector in The\nSilence of the Lambs, has labeled the\nAcademy Awards system \u2018disgusting\u2019.\nIn a recent interview with The Hu\ufb00ington Post, Hopkins voiced his concerns over the sycophantic behaviour\nactors are expected to show towards\nthe Oscar judges if they are to win an\naward.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been around \u2013 I\u2019ve got the Oscar myself for The Silence of the Lambs\n\u2013 and having to be nice to people\nand to be charming and \ufb02irting with\nthem... oh, come on,\u201d he said, with dis-dain.\n\u201cPeople go out of their way to \ufb02atter\nthe nominating body and I think it\u2019s\nkind of disgusting. That\u2019s always been\nagainst my nature.\n\u201cYou know, kissing the backside\nof the authorities that can make or\nbreak it \u2013 I can\u2019t stand all that. I \ufb01nd\nit nauseating to watch and I think it\u2019s\ndisgusting to behold. People groveling\naround and kissing the backsides of\nfamous producers and all that.\nAnthony\u2019s Anti Academy Awards\nThe Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit\ndirector Peter Jackson is currently\nat loggerheads with animal rights\nactivist group PETA (People for the\nEthical Treatment of Animals) over\nalleged animal cruelty during the\n\ufb01lming of the Tolkien stories\u2019 \ufb01lm\nfranchise.\nJackson has vehemently denied\nclaims made by animal handlers\nwithin his production team that up\nto twenty-seven animals used in the\n\ufb01lms died as a direct result of neglect.\nThe handlers, who worked on The\nLord of the Rings trilogy, claim that\nthe deaths of various horses, goats,\nchicken and sheep were due to the\nliving conditions at the nearby farm\nwhere they were kept, which was allegedly full of \u2018blu\ufb00s, sinkholes and\nother deathtraps\u2019 \u2013 although they admit that no animals were harmed on\nthe set itself.\nPETA has now taken up the cry,\nand is now threatening to protest at\nthe upcoming New Zealand, UK and\nUS premieres of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey \u2013 having previously\nPeter vs PETA\nwritten to Jackson to voice their con-cerns.\nJackson responded with an open\nstatement. \u201cThe producers of The\nHobbit take the welfare of all animals very seriously and have always\npursued the highest standard of\ncare for animals in their charge,\u201d he\nstated. \u201cAny incidents that occurred\nthat were brought to their attention\nas regards to this care were immediately investigated and appropriate action taken. This includes hundreds of\nthousands of dollars that were spent\non upgrading housing and stable facilities in early 2011.\n\u201cThe producers completely reject\nthe accusations that twenty-seven\nanimals died due to mistreatment\nduring the making of the \ufb01lms. Extraordinary measures were taken to\nmake sure that animals were not used\nduring action sequences or any other\nsequence that might create undue\nstress for the animals involved.\n\u201cOver 55% of all shots using animals\nin The Hobbit are in fact computer\ngenerated; this includes horses, po-nies, rabbits, hedgehogs, birds, deer,\nelk, mice, wild boars and wolves.\nThe American Humane Association\n(AHA) was on hand to monitor all\nuse of animals by the production. No\nanimals died or were harmed on set\nduring \ufb01lming.\n\u201cWe regret that some of these accusations by wranglers who were dismissed from the \ufb01lm over a year ago\nare only now being brought to our\nattention. We are currently investigating these new allegations and are\nattempting to speak with all parties\ninvolved to establish the truth.\u201d\nKathy Guillermo, the senior vice\npresident of laboratory investigations\nat PETA, said informers on the set of\nThe Hobbit had been in contact with\nthe PETA following the organisation\u2019s previous active roles exposing\nanimal care issues on other \ufb01lm sets.\n\u201cWe want to send a clear message to\nHollywood that they need to be very\ncareful when using animals and take\nall the precautions that need to be\ntaken,\u201d she is quoted as saying.\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which is the much-anticipated\n\ufb01rst installment of the Hobbit trilogy,\nis scheduled to debut on the 28th\nNovember 2012 in Wellington, New\nZealand, and will open at cinemas in\nthe UK on the 13th December.\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\n\u201cIt makes me want to throw up, it really does. It\u2019s sick-making. I\u2019ve seen it\nso many times. I saw it fairly recently,\nlast year. Some great producer-mogul\nand everyone kisses this guy\u2019s back-side. I think, \u201cWhat are they doing?\nDon\u2019t they have any self respect?\u2019 I\nwanted to say, \u2018Fuck o\ufb00\u2019.\u201d\nDespite having said this, Welshborn Hopkins, 74, says he has absolutely no plans to retire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to retire. I did a\nfew years ago. I didn\u2019t actually plan\nit, but I thought, \u2018Maybe I should just\nslow down and call it a day\u2019. My wife\nsaid to me, \u2018You do that, you will die.\nYou can\u2019t retire. It\u2019s your work; it\u2019s\nyour life. You love working\u2019.\n\u201cWhen men retire \u2013 particularly\nmen \u2013 if they get out too early, they\nusually die of stress or loneliness or\nthey drink too much or their hearts\ngive out. I think a certain amount of\nstress in life is good. The stress of just\nworking, which takes e\ufb00ort \u2013 I think it\nkeeps you going.\u201d\nHopkins is currently tipped for an\nOscar nomination for his portrayal\nof Alfred Hitchcock in his new \ufb01lm,\nHitchcock, which is to be released in\nthe UK on February 8th 2013.\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\n\n"

Where to begin!\nBack when I was a lad, I lived in the\nfar-o\ufb00 land of Ethiopia. And so it was\nthat my \ufb01rst memorable experiences\nof Christmas were set in that amazing country. Christmas was always a\ntime of fun and joy, a relaxed and even\nmagical time of the year which I always loved.\nChristmas in Ethiopia, though, isn\u2019t\nquite the same. For starters, they\u2019ve\ngot the date all wrong; they celebrate\nit on January the 6th. Not only did this\nlead to a great deal of confusion about\nwhen one could open one\u2019s presents,\nbut while I was enjoying my Christmas, all my friends were still waiting\nfor theirs, which wasn\u2019t ideal, but I still\nloved the Christmas season.\nAnd the presents, well, the presents were never great in all honesty.\nWhen the only shop in town is the\nlocal butcher, you aren\u2019t exactly overwhelmed by gift options. But nev-ertheless, those presents that I did\nreceive always brought tremendous\nexcitement and joy.\nOh, and the music. What\u2019s all this\nbusiness of dreaming about a white\nChristmas? In Ethiopia the weather\nW\nwas always gorgeous at Christmas\ntime; a white Christmas was rather a\npreposterous idea to my young mind,\nand I never for a moment fell for this\nsilly business of enjoying a freezing\ncold winter Christmas.\nBut that was Christmas to me, and\nI cherished it. Never once did I think\nthat Christmas could get any better.\nI returned to the UK aged fourteen,\nduring summer, which left me thinking the weather here wasn\u2019t too bad.\nI was wrong. The days grew shorter\nand colder, and I began to wallow in\ndismay at the loss of Ethiopia, and\nrefused to embrace this pathetic and\nmiserable season as the ful\ufb01lment of\nmany a besotted artist\u2019s Christmas\nsongs.\nBut then came Christmas, and for\nthe \ufb01rst time I began to see what it\nwas all about! The twinkling lights\nstrung across dark cobbled streets,\nthe smell of crushed pine nee-dles, the rich \ufb02avours of\nmince pies and the\nwarmth of mulled\nwine. The season\nseems capable of\nmaking even the\nmost miserable\nof folk able produce a friendly\n\u201chello\u201d as you\npass them on\nthe street.\nAnd let me not forget the snow. That\n\ufb01rst Christmas, I awoke one morn\u2019 to\nthe sight of a landscape covered in a\nblanket of white.\nAnd suddenly, those countless songs\nI\u2019d listened to, and enjoyed singing,\nbecame real. The Christmas I\u2019d heard\nabout but never really paid any attention to was suddenly my actual Christmas, and it was better than any I\u2019d had\nbefore; Christmas had improved.\nI\u2019d love to invite you to never stop\nsearching for a happier Christmas,\nand if I may o\ufb00er a way to do so, let me\nshare with you the foundation of my\nChristmas, which has and will always\nbe by far the most joyful part of it.\nOn an ordinary night in a small town\nsome 2000 years ago, a small, wrinkly\nbaby was born in a little room, surrounded by stinking animals and laid\nin a disgustingly unhygienic man-ger. The lowest and most humiliating of births imaginable, a\nreal birth, a baby who\nscreamed and cried\nlike any other; and I\ntruly believe this baby\nwas God.\nThis may not be the\ncharming nativity\nscene that you\u2019ve\nheard of before, in\nfact, quite the op-posite, and it sure doesn\u2019t sound like\ngood news. But it is, and here\u2019s why.\nIt means that God is not Father\nChristmas, a distant \ufb01gure watching your every step to see if you are\nnaughty or nice, concerned only with\nhis presents. Everyone loves Santa\none day of the year, but the rest of the\ntime he\u2019s just a loner. Is that the story\nof God?\nNo. This is a God whose gift is him-self, his all, his own life. And it\u2019s not\njust gifted to those good enough to\nmerit it, but it\u2019s a free gift to everyone.\nThis is a God who comes to the world\nout of love, his intention to befriend\nus, and who comes o\ufb00ering joy.\nI asked you at the start what your\nfavourite part of Christmas was, and\nthere are so many things to choose\nfrom, but for me the lowly birth of a\nbaby eclipses them all.\nIf you would like to keep searching\nfor an even Merrier Christmas, consider starting here, with Jesus.\nThe Christian Union carol service\nis happening on the 8th of December.\nWe\u2019d love you all to come along and\nget into the Christmas Spirit with us.\nSing some Christmas Carols, enjoy\nsome mince pies, and if you would\nlike to \ufb01nd out a little more about Jesus, about whom so many songs of joy\nhave been written.\nI wish you all a Merry Christmas!\n\u201d\nI\u2019d love to invite you to\nnever stop\nsearching\nfor a happier\nChristmas\nYasser Mahmoud\n\u2019m sat across the table from\nmy friend from Gaza; he\nonly got back a week ago but\nsomehow home has managed to \ufb01nd its way back on\nthe news. In between bites of SCR\nchicken he tells me about his friends\nback home. I ask if they\u2019re OK and\nhe nods. Suddenly he remembers\nthat one of his friend\u2019s sisters has\ndied. He tells me that she left behind\na baby, a little girl only 14 months\nold \u2013 another orphan and another\ndead mother. Of course she was Palestinian, nationless and now dead,\nher only crime to have been born in\nGaza.\nWhy would she matter anyway?\nShe is only one person, one among\nmore than one hundred and sixty\nothers. She will become nothing\nmore than a statistic, a number,\nsoon to be forgotten and perhaps contributing to a Wikipedia\npage or a news article. Her child\nwill undoubtedly not forget being brought up without a mother\n\u2013 or maybe she will be killed before the end. I hear they have just\nannounced a cease\ufb01re, so maybe\nthere\u2019s hope for her yet.\nOur conversation moves to his\nnephew, not yet three years old\nbut already taking it upon himself\nto warn the household when he\nhears the sound of explosions out-side. There are no sirens in Gaza,\nno warning of the impending destruction of a bomb or a missile.\nThere are no public shelters to \ufb02ee\nto or safe rooms to hide in, just the\ncries of children, it seems, warning their families when they hear\nloud noises. The children of Gaza\nmay yet sleep in peace tonight, a\nchange from the incessant sound\nof drones piercing the night, the\nsound of a million lawnmowers\nwith the occasional bang shaking\nthem awake.\nIt\u2019s funny that his family ended\nup in Gaza at all, expelled by the\nIsraelis from a town called Ashdod\nin the ethnic cleansing of 1948,\nalong with seven hundred thousand others from their homes.\nHis grandparents have never been\nback and neither has he: Palestinian refugees aren\u2019t allowed to go\nand see the places they once called\nhome. It\u2019s ironic that Ashdod is\nalso on the news, the destination\nof many of the rockets \ufb01red from\nGaza, only a 20 minute drive away,\nso close to home yet a world away.\nThe numbers game in Gaza is\nnot important, but no doubt the\ndeath toll will be tragic. Needless to say that when one of the\nworld\u2019s most advanced armies in\nthe form of the Israeli Defence\nForces decides to punish a people with no army, no navy and\nno air force, what happens is not\nwar, it is a massacre. That is what\nwas witnessed four year ago in\n2008/2009 and that is what we saw\nin the eight days past, a collective\npunishment for a population that\ndared to resist. It is also ironic that\nthese operations pop up every few\nyears conveniently just before Israeli elections, as if the price to\nbe paid for political success is the\nnumber of Palestinians one can\nbutcher.\nThe point at which we resign\nourselves to apathy and think that\none people, in some corner of the\nworld, are dying just because that\nis how things are, is the point at\nwhich we lose our humanity. I\npray for peace in the Middle East\nbut I realise that there can never\nbe a lasting peace in the absence\nof justice, and the blood of guiltless people will continue to be\nspilt, so long as politicians play\ngames with the lives of innocents\nin the balance.\nI\nNot all people are born equal\nYasser Mahmoud on the recent conflict in Gaza\n\n"

The night is capped o\ufb00 by\nZeni Geva, a trio featuring KK Null and\nthe drummer from Ruins. Their music is\na brutal blend of death metal, hardcore\npunk, noise rock and many other genres.\nHaving seen them earlier this year I can\nattest that their live performance has an\nenergy and \ufb02uency that doesn\u2019t disap-point.\nSunday\u2019s highlights include post-punk\nout\ufb01t Mission of Burma, another band\nwidely reputed for giving a good perfor-mance, who have, since their reunion,\nfeaturedShellacbassistBobWeston.This\nis complemented nicely by noise rock\nduo Gay Witch Abortion.

    "content": "[Force Persuade] Play KOTOR\nEdward Bals hasagoodfeelingaboutthis....\nll right, I know my force\npowers don\u2019t work\nthrough the printed\nword. I guess I\u2019ll have\nto persuade you instead with the actual reasons why you\nshould play this game, and if those\ndon\u2019t work, well; you are strong-willed\nindeed.\nSWKOTOR (Star Wars \u2013 Knights of\nThe Old Republic, for those in the know)\nis an RPG developed by Bioware, the developer that more recently has given us\nMass E\ufb00ect and Dragon Age. KOTOR\noften appears in lists of the best games\nof all time and its in\ufb02uence can be seen\nin many areas of the gaming world. It\nmanages to keep quests fresh and en-tertaining, and to supply us with an\nassortment of interesting, memorable\ncharacters (HK-47 the homicidal droid\nbeing a particular favourite, providing a\nlot of comic relief). However I will just\nsay this, the game is from 2003 and so\nhas graphics from that period. Graphics\nwhores beware, this is probably not the\ngame for you, but if you want an engaging game and are able to put on your\nnostalgia glasses then I thoroughly recommend it.\nThe plot of the game is set 4000\nyears before the rise of the Galactic\nEmpire and revolves around the return of the Sith who are (surprise, sur-prise) out to destroy the Republic and\nthe Jedi order because... Jedi are weak\nand emotionally stunted? OK, so the\ngame\u2019s overarching story is fairly ge-neric, but since when is the highlight\nof Star Wars the overarching story?\nWe have come to expect the battle between the light and dark side, but it is\nthe smaller stories that are told in KOTOR that are the real highlight of the\ngame, along with a well handled plot\ntwist near the end.\nMany of the quests are beautifully\ncrafted mini-stories. One of my particular favourites is a tearful woman\nthat wants her robot \u2018companion\u2019 returned to her, as he has gone missing.\nWhat seems like a generic fetch quest\nquickly becomes a memorable gaming\nexperience. Upon \ufb01nding her robot\nyou \ufb01nd out that he ran away because\nafter the death of her husband, the\nwoman had made the robot a surrogate husband, which he thought was\nunhealthy behaviour. Her somewhat\nquestionable relationship with her\nrobot chum can be solved in a few\ndi\ufb00erent ways. You can tell him to re-turn, destroy him, telling the woman\nhe\u2019s dead or destroy him and lure her\nout into the grasslands as well. This\nhumour shows o\ufb00 the writing talent\nat work for the game and makes you\nwonder why more games can\u2019t o\ufb00er a\nsimilar degree of humour and choice.\nThe game also o\ufb00ers a few di\ufb00erent worlds to visit, each with di\ufb00erent\nenvironments, inhabitants, and potential party members. These are travelled between in your ship, the Ebon\nHawk, a forerunner of the Millenium\nFalcon. The galaxy map and the ability\nto speak to party members on board\nwere such good, well implemented\nideas that they were reused as main\nfeatures of the Normandy, in the Mass\nE\ufb00ect series.\nThe game also constantly presents\nyou with moral choices, allowing you\nto be a light-side hero or a dark-side\nvillain. This mechanic has been used\nin many games since, such as Infamous and the Mass E\ufb00ect series and,\nbecause of its binary choices, it has its\nfailings. Whilst allowing access to different powers and dialogue options it\nbasically boils down to: do you want\ncool lightning powers, or are you a\nmorally driven person, even in a vide-ogame? The choices in dialogue are\nvery plainly good or evil, detracting\nfrom the experience. There is no real\nmoral grey area explored, as has been\ndone in the recent Witcher games, you\neither choose good or evil, never really being given a choice between two\nevils.\nThe gameplay itself is a real-time\ncombat system in which you can\nchoose a variety of options (such as\nthrow grenade, lightsaber attack,\nlightning etc.) with your commands\nthen queued and carried out by your\nparty. Combat can be paused at any\ntime to issue commands and you can\nalso switch characters to give them\ncommands. This allows for a versatile\nbattle system that can be light touch\nor micro-managed to your tastes.\nThe success of combat options is\ngoverned by your various stats, with\nbehind the scenes dice rolls deciding\nyour actual success. This system gives\na sense of progression through the\ngame, as early in the game, nearly all\nof your sword strikes or blaster shots\nmiss, but later in the game your attacks will do large damage and will\ngive you a real sense of power.\nAs to the sound used in the game,\nyou de\ufb01nitely get a Star Wars-y feel\nfrom the score which still manages to\nremain fresh, the voice actors aren\u2019t\nbad either. The majority of the game is\nspoken in Galactic Basic, which luckily remains the same as our language\nhere on Earth. The few lines of Huttese\nand others that are used are just a few\nlines of recorded dialogue, repeated\nto mean di\ufb00erent things. This may aggravate hard core Star Wars fans, but\nthankfully I\u2019m not one of those and so\ncan happily go on living my life without a care about whether that Hutt\nactually asked me to k i l l\nthat guy or if he\njust wanted me to\nget him a drink.\nSo I\u2019ll end as I\nstarted \u2013 thankfully the time\nthat you have\ntaken to read this\narticle has allowed me to\nget close\nenough to\nuse my force\nmind powers\non you\u2026 at\nleast the article served\nits purpose.\nA\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\n14\nHK-47. Colour schemes\navailable: Copper and\nBlood-Coated\nMy issue with GAME\nGAME (and co.)\n(and co.)\nOnce in a blue moon, I actually buy my\ngames from a brick and mortar store.\nThe UK (and the rest of the world, to\nbe honest) has been losing high street\ngames retailers, to the digital distribution mammoths (Steam, Amazon,\netc) and their slightly smaller and odd\nnephews (see: EA\u2019s Origin). O\ufb00ering\nlower prices than their physical coun-terparts, these online retailers have\nbeen whittling away at the competi-tion, causing a drop in sales of physical media. No longer will you \ufb01nd a\nstandard edition of a game that contains the printed manual of old, and\ninstead, all the physical goods come\nin the over-priced collected/limited/\ndeluxe/SUCKA editions.\nNow I can see why physical shops are\nfailing. We\u2019ve been spoiled for too long,\nby these instant-purchase methods,\nwhere you enter a string of numbers into\nyour screen, and suddenly the game\u2019s\ndownloading onto your computer. It\u2019s a\ngreat method that appeals to those most\nlikely to play PC games i.e. youthful\ntechnophiles. I went into GAME back\nin summer 2012 to pre-order Assassin\u2019s\nCreed III for my brother. If you pre-or-dered on July 4th (Independence Day)\nyou got a bunch of branded collectibles\n(ACIII T-Shirt, lanyard, badge-y/em-blem-y thing (you get the idea)), which\nwould be a nice addition for a birthday\npresent, so I thought I\u2019d get the Join or\nDie Collector\u2019s Edition for PC (my family\u2019s a bunch of PC-lovers).\nThe PC release of ACIII rolled around\nonFridayjustgone.Despitethefactthat\nthe branch I pre-ordered from (Oxford\nStreet) had closed, the pre-order had\nbeen moved to Hamleys. Lovely. I really\ndo enjoy pushing my way through a sea\nof whales and their spawn only a month\nbefore Christmas. Strike one.\nI turn up in the rain on the Saturday\nto \ufb01nd that the game has not even been\ndelivered to the store yet and that they\ndon\u2019t know when it\u2019ll be in stock. They\nonly hold copies for 48hrs, so if I\u2019m late\nto pick it up, they\u2019ll sell it to the horde \u2013\n\u201cCome back on Monday\u201d they say. I get\nback and realise that it\u2019d be a good idea\ntoleavemynumberwiththem.After30\nminutes of Googling and 10 minutes of\nconversations with automated phone-bots, I got nowhere and was charged for\nthe pleasure. Strike two.\nI pop in on Monday, as I\u2019ve no lectures till late \u2013 they take down my\nnumber and suggest I go and talk to\none of their reps through their webchat service (which isn\u2019t available during the weekend, FYI). During my chat\nwith \u201cCharlie\u201d, we covered that I\u2019d done\nnothing wrong, but there\u2019s a very good\nchance that my pre-order had been sent\nto their Camden store instead. In other\nwords, the game that I had started paying for, had been moved to another\nstore without my knowledge and then,\nwhen I didn\u2019t arrive on the other side\nof London to pick up the game, they\nsold it o\ufb00. Charlie didn\u2019t know when\nany store would be getting new stock\nand as my preorder was conducted in-store, I couldn\u2019t get it transferred to\nan online purchase, forcing me to buy\nit online instead. Aaaaaaaaaaaannnd\nstrike three!\nI\u2019m gonna have a nice long complain\nto customer services. I think I\u2019ll stick to\ntheSteamsalesfornow.Alltheparanoia\nin the world about not having physical\nmedia can\u2019t stop me from emptying my\nwallet into Gaben\u2019s accounts.\nNow I can see why their breed is dying\no\ufb00. Maybe they\u2019ll follow the path of the\nrecord store. Good riddance.\nDeposit: \u00a35. Travelling: \u00a38. Phone\ncalls: 96p . Having your game sold to\nsomeone else without your knowledge:\npriceless.\nImperial vs.\nUCL Round 2\nTIL: Steve\nMartin\nwent to UCL\nAngry Gamer Angry Geek\u2019s Cousin\nRoss Webster Games Editor\nThis Tuesday, it was Imperial\u2019s turn\nto host the Imperial vs. UCL gaming\ntournament. The room was packed,\nso I was expecting \ufb01erce \ufb01ghting from\nboth sides. Instead, I was met with\nfamiliar faces at every turn. In fact,\nabout 80% of the room were Imperial\nstudents, from what I\u2019ve heard.\nMy spies, have mentioned that\nthere\u2019s a bunch of deadlines for UCL\nstudents this week and that\u2019s why they\ndidn\u2019t turn up. Looks like there was a\nslight fail over in the communications\ndepartment. Expect a rescheduling.\n\n"

Oh, the infamous neg.\nThis is where you give a girl backhanded compliments to lower her\nself-esteem to the point where she\u2019ll\nsleep with even a guy like you.

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\nRevenge of the hacks\nThis may be old news to some, but\nat the start of term, the databases of\nseveral universities worldwide were\nhacked. Called \u201cProject WestWind\u201d\naccording the manifesto of \u201cTeam\nGhost Shell\u201d (http://pastebin.com/\nAQWhu8Ek) the system intrusions\nwere a protest about changes in modern education, both in terms of rising tuition fees. They also describe a\nchange in the usefulness of higher ed-ucation, stating \u201c\u2026we have ventured\nfrom learning valuable skills that\nwould normally help us be prepared in\nlife, to just, simply memorizing large\nchunks of text in exchange for good\ngrades\u201d, something I\u2019m sure some students may identify with at time.

In the UK there\nis a still a great deal of fear surrounding animal rights extremists. This is\nlargely unfounded now but lobbying\nby groups such as BUAV (British union\nof Anti-Vivisectionists) was enough to\nmake the companies think twice,\u201d he\ntold Felix.\n\u201cSupport for animal research in the\nUK is still reasonably high (although\nthis has begun to fall). The actions of\nanti-vivisectionist groups have therefore had the e\ufb00ect of slowing the rate\nand increasing the costs of UK medical\nresearch.\u201d\nHe hopes the petition will persuade\ngovernment to convince hauliers to recommence transporting the required\nlaboratory animals. Aims also include\nhaving the government provide better\n\u201cencouragement, advice and protection\u201d to the companies in question.\nRecently, only 1% of the animals\nused in laboratory experiments were\nimported from outside the UK, however this small fraction is essential in\nresearch. The 1% from abroad comes\nfrom specialist breeding facilities, generally found in Europe.\nKnowledge of the animals\u2019 speci\ufb01c\nstrain is essential in many areas of research and often only certain strains,\nsuch as genetically engineered mice,\nare required for experiment. Researchers claim that if they unable to get the\nrequired animals the UK will be unable\nto stay at the forefront of biomedical\nresearch and, in the long term, new\nmedical expertise will be damaged and\npatients will su\ufb00er.\nGenetically modi\ufb01ed mice, for exam-ple, are useful in drugs testing and understanding the mechanics of illness.\nA large proportion of research being\ndamaged includes that into cancer and\nAlzheimers.\nFormer Science Minister (2008-2010), Lord Drayson has said, \u201cBy giving in to the protesters they [the hauli-ers] are inadvertently choking o\ufb00 vital\nresearch into some of the most debilitating diseases a\ufb00ecting our society.\u201d\nThe campaign for resumption of animal transportation is currently being\nsupported by Understanding Animal\nResearch, Speaking of Research and\nacademics from numerous institutions,\nincluding the Royal Veterinary College.\nMore explicit support from the institutions themselves is expected in the very\nnear future.\nThe government e-petition can be\nfound at epetitions.direct.gov.uk/peti-tions/40111\nAnd the campaign\u2019s website is keepresearcha\ufb02oat.org\nResearch halted?\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\n\n"

Pages 19-22\nAemun Reza News Editor\nA new government e-petition has recently been launched in opposition to\nthe perceived growing e\ufb00ect that an\nanimal rights activist campaign has\nhad on the transport sector. The petition urges the government to protect the transportation of laboratory\nanimals to halt the loss of vital medical\nresearch. This is a response to the increased refusal by haulage companies\nto import the animals from overseas\ndue to increased lobbying by the activists\u2019 campaign.\nThe activists, in disagreement to the\ntesting of animals, allegedly began a\ncampaign of targeting hauliers with\ncomplaints via online social media and\nthrough letter writing. The accusatory nature of the campaign chastises\nthe transport companies for being involved in the trade.\nThe lobbying has had large e\ufb00ect on\nthe industry, with the campaign succeeding in stopping the companies,\none-by-one, from taking part in the\npractice. British Airways stopped importing laboratory animals early on.\nThis was followed by large ferry operators P&O, SeaFrance, DFDS Seaways.\nIt was revealed that earlier this year\nthe last major ferry operator, Stena, has\nalso pulled out of the trade. This has\nclosed o\ufb00 all sea routes for the importation of the animals.\nPeter Wright, a PhD student in\n>>5\nImperial team \u201cIC\nCrowd\u201d in the top 3\n83 technology students from 15 different Universities participated in\nJ.P Morgan\u2019s \ufb01rst ever Tech Coding\nChallenge. 17 teams competed in this\nHackathon-style event that took place\nin the headquarters of J.P.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\nlying is terrifying: trust\nme, I\u2019ve tried it. And\ndon\u2019t bother trying to\ncontradict me, because\nhow could sitting in a\nmetal can 30,000 feet up in the air\nnot be scary?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though. I\u2019m a\nPhysicist and a firm believer in both\nBernoulli\u2019s Principle and Newton\u2019s\nSecond Law (indeed I have no objection to any of Newton\u2019s laws). I know\nthat the plane should stay in the air.\nAnd I\u2019m reliably informed that I\u2019m\nmore likely to meet my end in Lapland, ravaged by kangaroos, than be\ninvolved in even the most minor of\naviation incidents. This doesn\u2019t reassure me, but instead just increases\nmy wariness around those unusual\nmarsupials.\nFlying is scary because you have\nabsolutely no control over what is\ngoing on. If and when something\nbad happens, the chances of escaping alive are slim. In addition, you\ncan do nothing to maximise your\nchances of survival \u2013 you\u2019re all in\nthe same boat, so to speak. Surely all\nhumans feel this helplessness when\nthey fasten their seatbelt, ready for\ntake off?\nSo why is it that I find myself in the\nminority \u2018fear-of-flying\u2019 camp? Why\nam I the only one who cowers under\ntheir blanket during take off? Why\ndoesn\u2019t everyone else, like me, try to\nfind the airline with the best safety\nrecord, as opposed to the one easiest\non the pocket? And why on earth do\nsome people claim to enjoy flying? I\nmean, supposing they\u2019ve conquered\nthe whole scary bit with the plane in\nthe sky, surely they can\u2019t find zero\nleg-room, a barely audible film and\ndubious food pleasurable? \u201cPerhaps\nthey\u2019re business class people?\u201d I hear\nF\nStephanie Walton shares her travel woes \u2013 and makes some\nworrying predictions for the future\nyou say. No way \u2013 they\u2019re the ones\nwho always look the least happy on\nthe flight. When you catch your two\nseconds\u2019 glimpse of them sipping\ntheir champagne, they\u2019re never smil-ing. Indeed, if any of these economy\nclass people who claim to enjoy flying actually genuinely do, I\u2019m going\nto find them and ask them to judge\nmy thesis \u2013 they must be extremely\neasy to please.\nI expect that in the early twentieth\ncentury when commercial aviation\nwas just taking off (no pun intended)\npeople would have given flying a bit\nmore thought. Flanders and Swann\ncertainly understood where I was\ncoming from, exemplified in their\nwitty piece \u201cBy Air\u201d: \u201cIf God had\nintended us to fly, He would never\nhave given us the railways.\u201d But the\ntruly frightening thing is that, whilst\nFlanders had to get his head around\nflying, we\u2019re going to have to embrace rocket travel. Indeed, some\nalready are. Sarah Brightman, the\nsinger, is heading off to the International Space Station in 2015. And the\nentrepreneur Elon Musk wants to go\nto Mars. He co-founded PayPal, so\nStephanie Walton\nhe\u2019s surely capable of making it hap-pen. Space tourism will soon be all\ntoo real and, as with flying, you\u2019ll be\nmissing out on lots of adventures if\nyou don\u2019t hop on board.\nSo, next time you fly, fasten your\nseatbelt, put your rug over your\nhead, sit back (though not too far,\nyour seat-back must remain firmly\nin the upright position) and (try to)\nrelax. And if it all seems too awful,\nthen count your lucky stars that you\ndon\u2019t (yet) have to endure space sickness and bone loss just to become\nwell-travelled.\nFear of flying: just common sense!\nmet\nnot\nD\nPhy\nBer\nSeems perfectly\nsafe to me\nLetters\nSir,\nWe are writing this letter in response to\nan article published in the Comment\nsection on 23/11/12, entitled \u2018Virgins:\nquit whining!\u2019. The attitude toward\nwomen in this article is exempli\ufb01ed in\nthis quote: \u201cGetting back on the title,\nguys are concerned about the \u201clack of\nfemales\u201d (which directly e\ufb00ects their sex\nlife), while mostly girls are complaining about sexism. Dudes! Wake up!\nFor the \u201clack of females\u201d issue, when a\nhunter \ufb01nds no rabbits, he just hunts\nelsewhere, or he even settles with ducks,\nnot being sure whether the rabbit or the\nduck is mostly appreciated.\n\u201d\nComparing women to game dehuman-ises them by treating them like animals\nincapable of higher thought. Not only\nthat, it plays into a harmful narrative\nin which they are sport or sustenance for\nmen rather than people with their own\nlives and aspirations. Turning some people into targets lets others get away with\nsexual harassment and assault even in\n\u2018enlightened\u2019 societies in the West \u2013 in our\nown country, 25% of respondents to the\nNUS\u2019 Hidden Marks survey revealed that\nthey had been sexually assaulted.\nFelix prides itself on being the \u2018student\nvoice\u2019 at Imperial. In that case, what\ndoes it say about us, the students, when\nsexist articles make it into press? We understand the importance of giving people a chance to have their voice heard,\nbut when an article implicitly supports\nthe predation of women it crosses a line\nthat shouldn\u2019t be crossed.\nIC Feminist Society Committee\nComment Editors\u2019 reply:\nAs Comment editors, we are obliged\nto print whatever contributions we\nreceive, including the frankly bizarre\narticle to which you refer below.\nAs you rightly stated, any piece which\nsupports the predation of women crosses a line which should not be crossed.\nWe are sure that this was not the intention of the author, although we do realise that the quote which you reference\nmay be conducive to the formation of\nthat opinion when taken out of context.\nHad we considered the contents of the\npublished article to be out of keeping\nwith appropriate standards, we would\nnot have allowed it to be printed - and\nindeed, some parts of the original piece\nwere removed for this reason. However, we absolutely cannot censure a\nwriter completely just because we do\nnot necessarily endorse their opinions,\nnotwithstanding their rather inelegant\nmode of expression. This principle is\nembodied in Felix\u2019s motto, which is\n\u201ckeep the cat free\u201d.\nFurthermore, we are convinced that\nthe contents of the article will not be\ntaken as representative of the views of\nthe student body, but merely as those\nof the writer in question. Everyone has\na right to reply whether in article or\nletter form, and we are very grateful\nfor the fact that you have done so.\nKind regards,\nFelix Comment Editors\n\u201c\u201d\nI\u2019m reliably\ninformed\nthat I\u2019m more\nlikely to meet\nmy end in\nLapland,\nravaged by\nkangaroos\n\n"

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY Technology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nused to use browser based\nmusic services \u201cGrooveshark\u201d & \u201cHypem\u201d in addition to downloading to ful\ufb01l\nmy musical listening needs.\nHowever, I knew it wasn\u2019t really sus-tainable, especially considering that\nGrooveshark is in a very long legal\nbattle and is currently being sued by\nseveral labels, the biggest case for\n$17.1 billion from Universal. Combine this with Android, Apple and\nFacebook all removing the Grooveshark app from their OS/Social network and the future isn\u2019t bright for\nGrooveshark, or my musical ful\ufb01lment.\nAs a result, three months ago,\nI \ufb01nally gave in and signed up to a\nSpotify premium account. In those\nthree months though, I\u2019ve got to ad-mit, I didn\u2019t actually look back (un-til yesterday at least). Spotify has\ngrown incredibly since its initial invitation only launch in 2008 and its\no\ufb03cial UK open-to-all launch two\nyears later in Feburary 2010. The\nonline streaming music giant, originally from Sweden and now based\nin London, has most recently been\nbeta testing a web browser version\nto further extent it\u2019s already wide\nreach, that already includes excellent\nintegration within Windows, Mac\nOS, Linux, Facebook, Android, iOS,\nBlackberry, Symbian, webOS, Sonos\nand even Windows Phone (clearly\nthe most important for any growing\ncompany). The company has been\nslowly trying to gather a monopoly\nin the market and appears to be doing quite well, with Goldman Sachs\nvaluating the company at $3billion\nthis month.\nWhy not stay with Spotify?\nTwo weeks ago, on 13th November,\nGoogle released Google Music, LG\nmanufactured Nexus 4 and the Nexus 10, in the UK, all through Google\nPlay. It was largely successful day for\nGoogle as they sold out of the Nexus 4\nonline in under 15 minutes in the UK\nand later sold out stateside in under an\nhour (although they were selling the\ndevices at a heavily subsidised price\nfor launch).\nAcross the pond, US citizens have\nbeen lucky enough to have Google\nMusic since November 16th 2011.\nBut Google\u2019s latest iteration of Google\nMusic brought with it some pretty\nshiny and hefty new guns to help it\ntake on Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft\u2019s\nXbox Music, Sony\u2019s Music Unlimited\nand Apple\u2019s iTunes.\nThe Pros\nAdmittedly, I\u2019m two weeks late trying\nout Google Music, due to the fact I\u2019m\na \ufb01nal year student at Imperial and\njob hunting (Microsoft, IBM, Google,\netc, if you\u2019re reading, I\u2019ll be grateful\nfor a fast-track to assessment centre).\nDespite my slightly late adoption for a\nTechnology Editor, I\u2019ve still had time\nto test some of Google\u2019s incredible of-ferings.\nThe \ufb01rst being the new downloadable \u201cGoogle Play Music Manager\u201d.\nThis may just be a small upload client\nthat helps organise your music. But it\nallows all users to upload and store on\nthe Google Cloud up to 20,000 songs\nimported from their own music library in 320kpbs quality. Then it\u2019s accessible anywhere in the world, at any\ntime, on any laptop or anything running Android (at the moment). The\nbeauty of the service, and basically of\neverything the Mountain View giant\ndoes, is that this service is 100% free.\nSo, as of right now I have 6,324 songs\nthat are currently being uploaded to\nthe Google cloud.\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\n16\nI\nThe second main feature is its \u201cScan\n& Match\u201d technology that matches\nyour tracks with those already on\nGoogle Music to ensure all track information is correct (in future users\nwon\u2019t have to actually upload tracks).\nIn addition to matching the track in-formation, this feature will upgrade\nyour music to 320kpbs quality (if ap-plicable), and again, all for free! This\nversus the similar services of Amazon and Apple, who charge over \u00a320\nfor the service, but only upgrade to\n256kpbs, Google\u2019s a clear winner.\nGoogle has even catered for those\nannoying moments for when you\nmight lost connection for short periods of time (for example on the tube),\nby caching your recent and queued\nsongs just in case you lose signal. In\naddition, for o\ufb04ine play, all Google\nMusic songs in your library are available for download to your PC, phone\nand/or tablet, again all for free.\nWith regards to cost, Google Music\nis undercutting Apple iTunes by 20p\nper individual song (79p vs Apple\u2019s\n99p per song) and \u00a32-3 per album.\nThere is also some neat Google+\nintegration with a free \u201cshare a track\u201d\noption which helps out the very impressive but depressingly quiet social\nnetwork by allowing a free play of\nsongs to friends.\nFinally, Google is o\ufb00ering a good\neasy to use browser based interface,\nbut of course, this is really all subjective and in some people\u2019s opinions\ncould be a con.\nAll in all, the Pro\u2019s send us a strong\nmessage that Google Music has been\nwell worth the year long wait!\nThe Cons\nBy far the biggest con at the moment\nis that the mobile application is only\ncurrently on Android, excluding the\nhuge market of Apple iPhone users,\nthe signi\ufb01cantly smaller market of\nthose of us on Windows Phone as well\nas those people unfortunate enough to\nstill be on the ancient Blackberry OS.\nAnother con is that the service is\nbrowser based with no desktop application other than the very basic, but\nfunctional, \u201cGoogle Play Music Manger\u201d. For some people this\u2019ll prove to\nbe a pretty signi\ufb01cant disadvantage,\nbut in this Editor\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s almost a non-issue and very minor con.\nI think Spotify are making a very big\nstep in the right direction by developing their browser based software\nand think the biggest selling point of\nGrooveshark (other than the ridiculously large music catalogue of songs\nand remixes) was that it was browser\nbased and therefore more easily accessible anywhere in the world on pretty\nmuch any computer.\nFinally, Google are coming under\n\ufb01re from the UK\u2019s record industry\ntrade association, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), who aren\u2019t exactly happy with Google on the whole.\nThey\u2019re Chief Executive, Geo\ufb00 Taylor, complains that \u201cwe don\u2019t think it\nmakes any sense for them to be doing\nsomething which does support artists\nand then, on the other hand, undermine artists by referring consumers\nto illegal sites\u201d. The basis of the complaint has actually nothing to do with\nGoogle Music and is actually based on\nGoogle Search, as when you \u201cGoogle\u201d\na song you are provided with links\nto both legal and illegal sources. The\nBPI actually went so far to get several\niconic musicians, including $265 million rich Elton John, to write directly\nto PM David Cameron publically to\nwinge about Google. A Google Play\nrepresentative responded to the accusations claiming \u201cI think [the service]\nis something that is hopefully going to\nmake piracy obsolete because it\u2019s so\neasy to operate within the bounds of\nthe law that there is really no need to\ngo beyond them.\u201d Make your mind up\nas you like, but in this Editor\u2019s opinion (I hate reading that line in articles too), the BPI\u2019s argument is very\nweak as it\u2019s based solely on the fact\nthat Google won\u2019t be their bitch and\ncensor the lengthy list of websites the\nBPI want them to ban from internet\nsearch results.\nConclusion\nOverall, despite the cons, my mind\nis pretty made up on Google Music\nbeing well worth the wait. But, until\nMountain View release a Windows\nPhone app, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll still be paying\nfor my Spotify premium account and\nmake occasional use of Google Music\nas an excellent library storage facility.\nIt is still hard, however, to pick an\noverall winner for music lovers as\neverybody has di\ufb00erent preferences.\nThe best result will perhaps be a combination of two or more services, so\nI recommend trying out and trialling\nas many free services as you can. You\ncan try Google Music at music.google.\ncom and follow the online tour to discover more.\nOne thing is for sure though, if Apple want to remain at the forefront in\nthe future of digital music, it\u2019s going\nto need to radically innovate its 2001\nbased iTunes business model. The\nyounger and more agile Spotify and\nGoogle have come and innovated the\nmarket, will Apple be able to follow.\nGoogle comes into a pretty competitive market against these badass\u2019 of digital music, who all have their names in their logos, except iTunes - Apple always has to be different doesn\u2019t it.\nGoogle Music is finally here\nJason Parmar looks at Google\u2019s venture into the digital music market\nit allows users to upload\nand store up to\n20,000 songs\non the Google\ncloud for free\nif Apple want to\nremain at the\nforefront they\nneed to radically innovate\n...again\n\u201c\u201d\nthe biggest con\nat the moment\nis that the mobile application\nis only on Android\n\n"

    "content": "\u201cKeep the Cat Free\u201d\nIssue 1533 felixonline.co.uk\n30/11/12\nSPORT\nElke Wynberg Sports Writer\nHaving lost a match a few days earlier\nduring a freak weather storm in the remote countryside, the ICSM Ladies 1st\nXI de\ufb01nitely felt we could use a giant\ndose of good luck when we trooped out\nto play on Sunday 25 November. The\nearly morning sunshine and prospect\nof playing at Harlington boded well for\nour second LUSL match of the season,\nbut with the loss of several forwards as\nwell as a key defender (who had been\nbeaten up by Wednesday\u2019s opposition\nwith a hockey stick) meant that we all\nhad butter\ufb02ies in our stomach.\nOur opposition had been a league\nabove us last year\u2026 And after having\na \ufb02awless season, had been promoted\nto an even better league. This was obviously a \ufb01rst cause for concern. On\ntop of this, our presumption that non-medics have all the time in the world\nto train to be hockey gods couldn\u2019t be\navoided, and rumour had it that they\nhad international-level strikers. Our\nfantastically positive captain Rosie\nBelcher encouraged everybody to put\non a brave smile, but in reality we were\nhideously nervous. Like I said, we could\nuse some luck\u2026 Whether it was a coincidence that Rosie managed, for the\n\ufb01rst time in the season, to win the coin\ntoss, was a question to be answered by\nthe \ufb01nal score.\nFrom the moment the whistle blew\nto mark the start of seventy minutes\nof leg-destroying hard work, the whole\nICSM team was focused, determined,\nand skilful. Passes were strong and\nsimple; tackles were made with a real\ndetermination to win; and whenever a\nmistake was made, the team pulled together to help out. And instead of being\ndistracted by the surprise that we were\nactually making UCL look slow and in-experienced, we continued to keep up\nthe pace.\nHowever, what we had struggled with\nin previous games was achieving a result from our hard work: after all, the\nscore at the \ufb01nal whistle is what really\nmatters. But after some superb ball distribution from central-mid\ufb01eld Charlotte Read, striker Alison Kent was just\ntoo skilful to be stopped by the UCL de-fenders, passing the ball to Kylie \u2013 who\nplaced the ball solidly into the goal. It\ngoes without saying that the defenders\ncheered loudly, our forwards ran back\ngrinning from ear to ear, the mid\ufb01elders\nwere jumping up and down \u2013 and Anna\nHurley was doing all of the above at the\nsame time.\nWith some skilful attacking from the\nopposition and a sneakily-placed pass\nagainst the feet of one of our defenders,\nUCL had their \ufb01rst short corner against\nus. The rumours about this team\u2019s skill\nringing in our ears, we fully realised that\na well-rehearsed routine on their part\ncould land them an equaling goal. Although Sharon \u201cShazza\u201d Ocansey made\na run out that Usain Bolt would have\nbeen proud of, they messily pushed the\nball passed our club captain and goalie,\nJess Mistry.\nOur realisation that we absolutely\nwere the better, more strong-minded\nteam that day, made us \ufb01ght back with\na vengeance. Exclamations of \u201ccome\non medics!\u201d echoed around the pitch,\nwhilst the UCL players simply argued\nwith the umpires and didn\u2019t talk to each\nother. At half time, we were feeling elated but, as Rosie pointed out, still had a\nlot of work to do.\nEven though our legs were starting\nto feel like they were made of lactic\nacid, we started the second half with\nan expectation that UCL were going to\nbe more than slightly angry\u2026 So solid\nwas our e\ufb00ort that Charlotte Lees, who\nhad played a match the day before and\nconsequently \u201ccouldn\u2019t run properly\u201d\n,\nplayed a second half that earned her the\ntitle of MVP. With some initial play in\nour D, Jess made a cracking save with\nher stick well above her head, and Annabel Groome on the right and Roz\nMarshall as centre defence worked hard\nto clear the ball. Anna made some fantastic runs up the right wing, with forwards Alison, Flick, and Kylie all o\ufb00ering passes so that we could score more\ngoals and show this team what we\u2019re\nmade of.\nWith this incredible team e\ufb00ort, and\nthe support of our coach Justin from the\nsideline, Lees was able to score two perfectly placed goals in the second half\u2026\nOne of them even from lying on the\nground after falling over. Clearly balance was one of the (few) areas where\nUCL did have the advantage.\nWith the \ufb01nal whistle, we all attempted to contain our excitement at the\nresult. Every single team member had\nput in phenomenal e\ufb00ort, and we had\nout-played our opposition fairly and\nsquarely\u2026 At the end of the day, that giant dose of luck that we\u2019d all hoped for\nwasn\u2019t even needed.\nMedic Girls Thrash UCL\nTaeKwonDo Inauguration Huge Success\nThe work from countless months of\nplanning, organisation and training\n\ufb01nally came together as Imperial\nCollege Union TaeKwonDo (ICUT-KD) hosted their very own competition at the Ethos sports hall last Sunday. The Imperial College Open 2012\nwas the kick-start to the competitive year for many university clubs\naround the country and also the \ufb01rst\nTaeKwonDo competition to be held\non Imperial grounds in the history of\nthe club.\nAttracting over 100 competitors\nfrom universities all over the country\ntravelling from as far away as Shef\ufb01eld and Southampton, the atmosphere in the sports hall on Sunday\nmorning was full of excitement and\nanticipation for the day ahead.\nFor the ICUTKD team, we knew\nthat running a competition on top of\ncompeting was not going to be easy;\nLiYan Chow Sports writer many of our team having to act as of\ufb01cials as well as preparing for their\nown \ufb01ghts. However, that did not appear to faze our 14 \ufb01ghters, as they\nbrought back an impressive 12 med-als.\nWithin two of the categories, our\nmembers dominated the opposi-tion, with the gold medals and silver medals going to members of the\nICUTKD team who fought their way\ninto the finals. Roy Lambert and\nYemi Williamson-Taylor won gold,\nwith Kristian McCaul and Nathaniel Gallop winning silver medals.\nMabel Lew and Ernest Tan also won\nsilver medals with Andreas Panteli, Mayghal Vijapura, Christopher\nDancel, LiYan Chow, Ramdisa Agasi\nand Mathieu Hu all winning bronze\nmedals.\nHowever, it was the dedication of\nall the volunteers and o\ufb03cials on\nthe day which truly encapsulated\nthe spirit of TaeKwonDo. Without\na doubt, they all went out of their\nway to ensure that the competition\nas a success. Without them, the day\nwould not have run as smoothly as it\ndid. We have to thank the British Student TaeKwonDo Federation (BSTF),\nthe sta\ufb00 at Ethos and Sport Imperial\nfor all their support and a huge thank\nyou to all the \ufb01rst aiders, photogra-phers, referees, competitors and instructors without whom, Imperial\nCollege Open 2012 would have never\nhappened.\nFinally, we could not have achieved\nany of this without the hard work of\nour instructor, Master Reza Saberi,\nwho gave us the encouragement and\ncon\ufb01dence to take on this task in\nstyle.\nWith the Imperial College Open\n2012 done and dusted, ICUTKD can\nlook forward to the next Imperial\nCollege Open 2013!\nGo bib or go home\nThat\u2019s the last\ntime you push in\nfront of me in the\nLibrary Caf\u00e9\n\n"

The forces of King Harold\nline up against the invading Norman\nforces of William, Duke of Normandy.\nIt was a tightly fought battle (or so says\nthe tapestry of Bayeux), tipped by an\narrow through the eye of King Harold which in turn rallied the Norman\ntroops to their famous victory, shaping\nthe socio-political landscape of England, Europe and ultimately, the world.\nFast forward about 946 years later, and\nmove about 44.1 miles down the A28.\nOn Wednesday 14th November IC\n1s took a plane, two buses and \ufb01nally\nnavigated a 13 mile walk to reach Canterbury; the scene of the 2nd round of\nthe BUCS cup. The 1s had already beaten their opposition, Canterbury 2s, at\nhome (#FortressHarlington) 2-0 in the\nleague and were in a boisterous mood\nhaving won all 6 matches this season\nby 2 goals or more. Having completed\ntheir pilgrimage to the religious capital\nof Britain, the 1s were determined to\nrelive the heady heights of the previous\nseason by making a David-esque cup\nrun, although previous results would\nsuggest they enter the competition as\nGoliaths.\nThe scene was set before kick o\ufb00 with\nthe sun glistening o\ufb00 a layer of cobwebs\nthat encapsulated every inch of the\nCanterbury pitches, bringing a tear to\nJames \u2018Adam Watkin Junior\u2019 Murphy\u2019s\neyes. He then encouraged members of\nthe team to kneel down and view the\nsplendid sight from \u2018David Attenborough\u2019 view which was met with warm\nreception from approximately every\nmember of the team. Meanwhile, Canterbury 2s were watching confused and,\nimportantly, underestimating their op-position. After the brief National Geographic moment, it was time for foot-ball.\nIt was a game of two halves. And two\nmore halves. And a penalty shoot-out.\nThe pitch was \ufb01rm to hard and took\na while for both teams to get out of the\nstarting blocks, especially hindering\nImperial\u2019s patented blend of pass and\nmovefootball.Conversely,Canterbury\u2019s\nown brand prison-rules football was a\nnatural \ufb01t for their legion of overpaid\n(maybe), undersexed (de\ufb01nitely) and\ngenerally remedial footballers. Chances\nwere few and far between shown by the\nstartling stat that Bjorkstrand did not\nmiss a chance in the \ufb01rst half. A charming gentleman (number 5) in the oppo-sition, sporting a tasteful tapestry of his\nown on his arm, was helpful in reminding us, at regular intervals, that Sunday\nlunches are both delicious, wholesome\nand versatile. However, the deadlock\nwas broken when half time was ap-proaching. Canterbury lined up for a\nfree kick on the right touchline which\nwas whipped in with startling good\nfortune, evading the heads of Hill and\nWoodhead and also goalkeeper Garner,\nwho had no interest in claiming it or\nsaving the resulting shot. It was scu\ufb00ed\nback across goal by their penalty expert\n(see later, twice), and self-proclaimed\nformer professional footballer, number\n14, who was congratulated by his team\nmates for not being shit.\nThe second half produced a better performance from Imperial who,\nhaving concluded that their opposition were substandard, felt they had\nevery chance to turn the match around.\nJames Murphy, when he wasn\u2019t being\ndistracted by the local \ufb02ora and fauna,\nwas in exceptional form. For the next\n45 minutes he caused incessant problems for their left back who had no answers for the questions posed to him,\ncoincidentally a problem he had also\nsu\ufb00ered whilst sitting Maths GCSE. After captain Woodhead was forced from\nthe \ufb01eld of play with a bum injury, Tim\n\u2018Smithy\u2019 Beasley was put in charge to\nlead the resurgent Imperial team. The\nintroduction of Wedemeyer shortly after tipped the balance in Imperial's fa-vour. Justice was done 10 minutes from\ntime when Amjad \ufb01red a long ball, like\nthe very arrow that punctured the retina of King Harold 946 years before (and\n44.1 miles down the A28), and found\nMurphy on the right wing. The resultant cross found Robinson unmarked at\nthe back post and his downward header\nlocated the back of the net. The \ufb01nal\nwhistle blew 10 minutes later after another \ufb02urry of pressure from the Imperial front line.\nThe \ufb01rst half of extra time was largely\nnon-eventful, with both teams seemingly content to settle for a nailbiting\nshootout. Imperial were winning the\npossession battle but neither team\nlooked set to break the deadlock. That\nwas, until the second half of extra time.\nWith 10 minutes to go, a forceful but\nlegal challenge from Hill, that got 100%\nof the ball and approximately 0% of the\nman, earned a penalty for Canterbury\u2019s\nown Tom Daley. Number 14, fresh\nfrom his \ufb01rst half wonder goal, came\nto the conclusion that he was the best\npenalty taker in their team and strode\nup con\ufb01dently. James Murphy, Imperial's Oracle and resident wildlife expert,\ncon\ufb01dently informed Number 14 he\nwould not score. He didn\u2019t. His scu\ufb00ed\nshot down the middle was saved by a\nGarner right hand, despite his initial\nleftward movement. This resulted in\nthe whole Canterbury team wondering\nwhy they had let him take it in the \ufb01rst\nplace.\nPenalties loomed large and no team\nmustered enough strength to get a win-ner, although if any team looked likely\nit was Imperial. Hill made his presence known on a number of occasions\nseemingly winning everything in the\nair and in\ufb02icting collateral damage on\nthe ground (and resident spiders). For\nunknown reasons, Hill was unable to\ncomplete the match.\nHaving seen the incompetence of\nCanterbury\u2019s penalties already, Imperial were con\ufb01dent of the shootout win.\nWedemeyer, Robinson, Garner, Beasley and Ahmed Cherif (Jnr) put their\nnames forward, with some more con\ufb01dent than others. Beasley won the toss\nand Imperial took \ufb01rst.\nWedemeyer strode to the spot with\nGerman con\ufb01dence but his e\ufb00ort,\naimed at the top right corner was\nboth too top and too right. Shortly\nafterwards the \ufb01rst Canterbury taker\ndespatched his e\ufb00ort bottom left and\nImperial were 1-0 down. Robinson,\nImperial\u2019s regular spot kicker, also went\ntop right and left the keeper without a\nchance. Canterbury\u2019s number 14 decided that, despite clearly being rubbish at\npenalties, he would make amends for\nhis previous scu\ufb00ed penalty. He failed\nin spectacular style as he repeated his\nprevious attempt, scu\ufb03ng down the\nmiddle allowing Garner to save with\nhis right foot. His attempts at blaming the penalty spot for his miss fell\non deaf ears. Garner picked himself\nup from goal and retrieved the ball, to\nthe clear shock of every spectator. Despite this, with con\ufb01dence oozing from\nevery ori\ufb01ce, and after almost 10 million hours of penalty practice, he sent\nthe keeper the wrong way to give Imperial a 2-1 lead. Canterbury promptly\nmissed another penalty by skewing a\ndrilled penalty past the left hand post.\nBeasley had the chance to give Imperial\na two goal cushion but his penalty to\nthe keepers left was saved. Canterbury\nthen drew level at 2-2 with one penalty\nto go. Cherif Jnr took his penalty with\nhis pokerface showing nothing. He sent\nthe keeper the wrong way and found\nthe right hand corner of the net leaving\nImperial one penalty away from glory\n(the next round). The Canterbury player looked scared by the looming \ufb01gure\nof Garner and the pressure told. His\ntame e\ufb00ort was saved by the left hand\nof Garner, sending the Imperial players into rapture and Murphy into the\nnearby forest to look for more interesting Kent wildlife.\nGarner was voted man of the match\nbut everyone grafted well and showed\ngood character to recover from going\nbehind for the \ufb01rst time this season.\nImperial 1s remain unbeaten after 7\ngames and hope to have wrapped up\nthe BUCS league title when they travel\nto Canterbury for the last game of the\nseason.\nConclusions: Henry has shown (ex-perimentally) that he both saves and\nscores penalties, both in vivo and ex\nvivo. Despite a strong body of literature\nsuggesting otherwise (Euro \u201996), Marius\nWedermeyer does not.\nStorming Success for Equestrian Team\nImperial College Equestrian 1st team\nhad a great start to the season at Royal\nHolloway\u2019s home competition at Wayside stables near Windsor. Despite\nthe torrential rain and howling winds\nthe team prevailed and won, with individuals placed 1st (Captain Rachel\nGregory), 2nd (Liane Marshallsay),\n5th (Andre Wilmes) and 8th (Claudia\nSaksida). The team started well with\nLiane and Rachel winning on their\nhorses scoring 0 penalties in the dres-sage, despite Rachel\u2019s horse spooking\nhalf way through her test, and Claudia\nand Andre both did very well achieving 9 and 15 penalties respectively. At\nlunchtime the team was lying in \ufb01rst\nposition but only 3 penalties ahead of\nthe University of Kent. As the team\nwere about to show jump, the heavens\nopened the wind picked up so several\nof the show jumps fell down. After an\nextremely long wait Rachel was the\n\ufb01rst rider of the imperial team and\njumped a clear round. Claudia was the\nsecond to go on her horse and was a\nlittle nervous after the \ufb01rst rider on\nher horse fell o\ufb00 but she completed\nher round with one refusal. Andre\nwas third on his horse and jumped a\nmasterful clear round and \ufb01nally Liane also jumped a stylish clear round.\nWe had an extremely long and anxious\nwait while the Royal Holloway captain\ncalculated the incredibly confusing\nscores. Both Rachel and Andre had\nwon on their jumping horses scoring\n0 penalties while Liane and Claudia\nscored 6 and 15 respectively, leaving\nthe team in \ufb01rst place.\nRiding\u2019s next event is our home\ncompetition on Wednesday 5th December at Trent Park.\nOmar Amjad and\nHenry Garner\nSports Writers\nFootball Conquer The Counties\nRachel Gregory Team Captain\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nTelevision Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFRIDAY 30 NOVEMBER\nZombie Apocalypse Now\nThe Walking Dead marched straight into Jonna Nyb\u00e4ck\u2019s heart\nhen I \ufb01rst heard\nabout the TV\nshow The Walking Dead from\nmy friends I\ncouldn\u2019t understand their immense\nexcitement about it. On the question\n\u201cwhat is it about?\u201d I got the answer\n\u201cthe world is taken over by zombies\nand a few people are trying to survive\u201d. Well, that didn\u2019t do it for me.\nI mean, it sounds exactly like every\nother zombie movie out there. So I\nresisted.\nBut more and more of my friends\ngave in and started to watch and they\nall turned into these zombie loving fa-natics. It got to a point where my curiosity couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I\nbroke down and watched the \ufb01rst episode to see what the huge hype was\nabout, then the second episode, then\nthe third...\nIt\u2019s an easy watch, you don\u2019t have to\nbother your brain too much and it\u2019s\nalways nice to get a break from study-ing, just follow along the ride. But I do\nwarn you, it becomes highly addictive\nand might interfere with your study\ntime \u2013 especially if you\u2019re like me and\nonce you\u2019re hooked, can\u2019t stop watch-ing!\nTo break it down, Rick, who is a\nsheri\ufb00\u2019s deputy, gets shot and wakes\nup from a coma a few months later.\nDuring his coma a zombie apocalypse\nhas taken place and Rick \ufb01nds himself\nas what seems to be a lone survivor.\nWhen he \ufb01nds his wife and kid missing (of course they wouldn\u2019t still be\nin the house, the town is deserted!)\nhe marches on a quest to \ufb01nd them.\nDuring this search he meets several\nother survivors and it is interesting to\nfollow the group dynamic and watch\nhow an apocalypse can a\ufb00ect human\nbehaviour. One would think people\nwould look after one another, but the\nfear of not knowing who can be trust-ed, food and ammunition supplies being limited and with the tiny detail of\n\ufb02esh eating zombies all over the place,\nit turns in to survival of the \ufb01ttest.\nThe show, which is developed by\nFrank Darabont and premiered on\nthe cable television channel AMC\nin America in 2010, has received\nmany nominations such as the Writers Guild of America Award and a\nGolden Globe award nomination for\nBest Television Series Drama. With\n10.9 million viewers tuning in for the\nseason three premiere it became the\nmost-watched basic cable drama telecast in history.\nSo, yep, my friends were right. But\nas I am writing this I understand\nwhy my friends were frustrated with\nme as I said \u201cit sounds stupid\u201d when\nthey were talking about the show. The\nwhole zombie-splatter theme doesn\u2019t\ndo it justice, there is so much more to\nthe show. All I can say is watch it and\nyou\u2019ll see what I mean. Who knew\nI, myself, would turn into a zombie\nlover?\nW\nThere was a time when watching 5 episodes every week didn\u2019t pose a challenge for me. In fact, any week when\nthis did not happen was out of the\nnorm. I\u2019ve been \ufb01nding it a bit di\ufb03cult\nthis term, but never fear, I am up to\nthe challenge and will keep providing\nyou with my top picks.\nThis week\u2019s top 5 episodes contain\na blast from the past in the form of\nFrasier. I reviewed this show brie\ufb02y\na few years back and said it featured\none of my all-time favourite TV characters (Niles Crane) but I hadn\u2019t really watched it in almost a year. However, as it is my mom\u2019s favourite show\nand I was home for the weekend, we\nwatched a few episodes. One of them\neven managed to snag the top spot\nthis week:\nAfter a night spent comparing his\nnon-existent love life with Daphne\u2019s,\nFrasier decides to play matchmaker\nand tries to set her up with KACL\u2019s\nnew station manager, Tom. In a classic\ncase of misunderstandings and mis-communication, it turns out that Tom\nis gay and under the impression that\nan invitation to Frasier\u2019s for dinner\nis, in fact, a date. What follows is 20\nminutes of pure comedic excellence,\nfeaturing all of the show\u2019s main characters at their best.\nShe\u2019s definitely pulling that\nslit off better than Angelina\nMy Top 5 Episodes of the Week\nIt\u2019s been a love-filled week of TV\n1. Frasier, Season 2 Episode 4, \u201cThe Matchmaker\u201d\n2. Frasier, Season 3 Episode 13, \u201cMoon Dance\u201d\n3. The New Normal, Season 1 Episode 9, \u201cPardon Me\u201d\n4. How I Met Your Mother, Season 8 Episode 8, \u201cTwelve\nHorny Women\u201d\n5. Glee, Season 4 Episode 7, \u201cDynamic Duets\u201d\nMost Awkward Love Confession Award:\nDexter, Season 7 Episode 8, \u201cArgentina\u201d\nIt\u2019s always annoying when\nyou\u2019re the only one in fancy\ndress at a party\nLucia Podhorska Television Editor\nThey\u2019re both just a bit strange\n\n"

Where most\nalternative bands fall back to a simplistic chord sequence and uninspired lyrics to\nattempt the required atmosphere, Deftones seem to flow into their ballads effort-lessly. \u201cEntombed\u201d picks up some great electronic sounds to tell a much more serene tale \u2013 so serene that you could mistake it for dream pop.\n\u201cTempest\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u201d are both longer songs bordering 7 minutes, up from\ntheaverageof4,givingthebandmorerangetoexploreaslower,morecarefulstyle.\n\u201cTempest\u201d is probably the most straight forward song on the album and owes its\nlengthtoamoresubtlepaceandthespaciousintro. Thebridgeof\u201cRosemary\u201dhits\nthe ballad-like mood again before dropping the heaviest outro on the album.\nI can\u2019t find much fault with this new material (except, perhaps, the last track,\nwhich meanders a little too much for its own good), and most fans of their recent\nmaterial should agree. Put simply, as alternative rock, nu-metal, or whatever you\nlike to call this genre goes, Deftones seem to have to delivered as usual \u2013 hence,\nhow much you\u2019ll enjoy this is just down to how much you like their sound. In Japanese, \u201ckoi no yokan\u201d is an expression of knowing one will come to love someone\nafter meeting them (a subtle variation on \u201clove at first sight\u201d). Strong words, but if\nyou enjoy the band, they might just apply.\nRobin Thomas\nandering around\nthe large and\nlooming Alexandra Palace,\nsimultaneuosly\ntrying to avoid drunky, lairy forty\nyear old men who wanted to \u201cave it\nlarge\u201d while attempting not to trip\nover the large number of excited\nteenage girls scurrying about, it became blindingly obvious how much\nof a big deal The Vaccines have\nbecome. Few bands at the moment\ncould captivate such a diverse crowd\nwhilst releasing a new album, which\nalthough not revolutionary, provided a darker, more sinister step up\nfrom their wide-eyed debut.\nAlthough now stepping out onto a\nhuge stage as darlings of the main-stream, The Vaccines still have\npunk attitudes somewhere in their\nheart. Their choice of seminal Canadian hardcore band Fucked Up\nto be main support for this massive date confused and scared the\nswelling crowds in equal measures.\nTheir was little continuity between\nthe Beach Boy guitar pop which\nwould soon bring the venue to its\nknees and the brutal hollerings of a\nsemi-naked sweaty punk icon but I\nenjoyed the surprise nevertheless.\nThere have been countless articles\npredicting that The Vaccines can be\nsaviours of the guitar, drag modern\nindie out of its current rut and give\nit a new heart. From my very enviable position in the front row, I\ncould properly appreciate these outlandish claims. This is the first band\nsince The Libertines I have witnessed who inspired such devotion.\nThe ten thousand tickets for this\nshow sold out in the flash of an eye\nand by the number of disappointed\nfans outside I think they could have\neasily filled another night.\nOpening with newie \u201cNo Hope\u201d\nthe cheers, which went up around\nme, drowned out Justin\u2019s drawling\nchorus celebrating antithapy and\nselfishness. As the masses of gleeful\nfaces settled down, a large number\nof hits from the first album What\nDid You Expect From The Vaccines\nturn the Ally Pally into a sloshy mess\nof hormones and spilled lager.\nIt was, however, one of the best\nThe Vaccines at the Ally Pally\nMark England find a band who can inspire young and old alike\ntracks of the new album Come of Age\nthat caught my attention. \u201cTeenage\nIcon\u201d is a sweet three minute piece\nof surf pop perfection. The lyrics\nare not deep and it might be slightly\npredictable in the formula used, but\nboy does it leave you dumbstruck.\nThe Vaccines show that you do not\nhave to reinvent the wheel, you just\nhave to make it look cool and drop\nsome Strokes-lite fuzz on it.\nOne of the largest disappointments of the show was that their\nbest song to date \u201cWeirdo\u201d was\nThe Vaccin\nThe Vacc\nturn the A\nturn the A\nnot played at all.\nI cannot understand this omission given as it is\none of the centre-pieces of their latest album. Maybe\nit was deemed too\nslow, too heavy\nor too creepy and\nmight ruin the\nvibe but I think\nthey definitely\nmissed a trick,\nespecially with a\nrelatively quick\nset. I could so\nmany people desperate to sing out\nthe lines \u201cI don\u2019t\nwant to let it go,\nYou know I am\nnot a weirdo\u201d but this was not to be\ntheir night.\nWith an encore of \u201cBad Mood\u201d,\n\u201cWolf Pack\u201d and \u201cNorgaard\u201d there\nare outbreaks of euphoria not witnessed since the summer with The\nStone Roses reunion dates. There\nwas crowdsurfing galore and cir-clepits dominated the front section\nof the out of control crowd. The\nVaccines have oft been accused of\nbeing a pale pastiche, a 60s retro-revivalism outfit but the sight of todays youth getting their kicks from\nfuzzy surf pop rather than soul-less\nMinaj pop or fizzy drinks was no\nbad thing. Although watching hundreds of pre-pubescent faces singing back the lines to \u201cPost Break-Up\nSex\u201d in unison was strange to say the\nleast.\nReturning home to London for\nthis career defining show, the bands\nambition to impress was tangible.\nThey posed, they crooned, they\nrocked out on the stage, and the\nthousands packed into this venue\nresponded with a huge amount of\nlove. \u201cThis is the best fucking night\nof my life\u201d howled the ecstatic frontman and Justin and the gang looked\nlike they truly belonged up there in\nfront of all of these people: but what\nnext? In May of next year The Vaccines are due to play at the twenty\nthousand capacity O2 Area but are\nthey ready for headlining major\nfestivals? It is definitely a possibility but I think they need a bit more\ndepth to their repertoire if they were\nto storm Glastonbury.\nW\n\n"
