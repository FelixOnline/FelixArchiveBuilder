    "content": "FELIX DEVON TOUR After the end of the Summer\nTerm the Cricket Club made their Annual sortie into the West Country,\nIf one reads -the official report it might be thought that this wa3 just\nanother touring side intent on playing the game. All that appeared in the record book is: played 8 Won 4 Drawn 2 Lost 2.\nHowever Felix, after suitably\nbribing unwary members, is able to tell you the inside story.\nOn the first night injury\nstruck the side. harry Moss, the demon\nbowler from Burnley, cracked his collar bone. Unfortunately this did not\nhu>pen lua death or glory attempt at a catch. It happened when he fell from a drainpipe as he was attempting to raid\nAl Fawp'ett'a room with intent to remove\nsaid gentleman's moustache.\nBy the third day the team\nrecovered from the shock, and John\npre ede stunned\" the locals by taking 4\nwickets, with his first4 ball3 needless\nto say I.C. won.\nOn the fifth nish t the team\nwere still celebrating. Skipper Logan,\nwith an unusually magnanimous gesture,\nstrode into the bar and set up j pinto\nof shandy. Unfortunately no-one else\nturned up and Alan was seen some hours\nlater enquiring for the train for Middlesbrough. Paul Davies, not to be\noutdone by his Captain, wa3s till drunk\non the 6th day. While trying to take\na ball behind the wicket he somehow\nmanaged to head the ball for if byes -only a yard short of 6.\nBy the 8tb day the team nn na^ ed\nto sober up and were rewarded by achieving\na fine victory over Torquay.\nSPORT It is not often that one o an s it back and claim to have done the best\npass i ble. Last Session the College w Hockey, Socoer and Rugby Football teams\npulled off a unique achievement in the\nsporting history of the University by\nwinning the \"Triple Crown\" for the three\nmajor University' Cup Competitions. So\none o an say immediately we can not hope\nto do better; but we o an hope to repeat\nthe suo o ess. With excellent facilities for training, the high class opposition the\nCollege name and past reputation\nWith excellent facilities for training, the hie h class opposition the\nCollege name and past record can demand,\nand the enthusiasm injected into each\nclub by its officials there is no reason\nwhy anyone should not play a full part\nin maintaining the high standard set by\nour'predecessors. Unfortunately only\nabout JOi of the College take any active\npart in games. There are many sports\nclubs in the College, each catering for all standards from beginners to experts.\nIf you do not intend to take take the\ngame too seriously, you may like to\nplay for one of the 'Sport Teams',\nalthough rumour has it that getting a place in the B.3s or 7th team is now\nharder than getting into the first team.\nIf you cannot find the Cluhs\nyou require on your tour of the various\nstands, please enquire for it. Some details of Team Trials a are riven on the back page.\nFinally, take an old sportsman'stip if you don't want to let work\nworry you, don't think about it! H ARLINGTON SOOTHALL\n\u00bb\u2022 \u00ab*\u00ab \u00abl Th a, M.i.c. lie mm\nSWIMMING TOUR Once again the I.C. Water Polo\nClub with its fish-emulating fraternity, went West this summer. Although the\nobject was to play water polo, the unorthodox training in the equal ising of\ninterior and exterior hydrostatic\npressures played havoc with the team.\nThe first match, against\\\nWeymouth, was played off the end of the\npier at high tide, and we lost 5-4.\nThe cold water and slight sunburn brought\nabout our defeat. Amusement wa3 caused\nby Brian Hart leaving the pitch at half\ntime to pin up his trunks,\nThe following evening we played\nBridport, won by a handsome margin and\nadjourned to a local pub. Here one of\nthe gentlemen, not liking the local beer,\ndrank cider. Catastrophically as it turned out. After pursuing a French\ngirl to a caravan site, he arrived back\nill. He sai a next morning that he just\nwanted to die the night before. How\nnear he \u00ab>3 to being tipped out of the\nwindow, he' Ll never know.\nTravelling to Dartmouth R.K.C. via Exmouth, we had our first swimming\nmatch, which we lost, taking our customary positions of 2nd and 4thine a oh race. We won the polo match.\nThis brought us to our toughest\nfixture. Ilfracombe. A monumental\ndefeat was the result, of the order 18-1..\nWe left Ilfracombe.\"\nThe last match, which provided\nthe fina j. to the tour, and the local o ern i val, was at Mevagissey. A large\ncrowd saw us win ~>-4. Our goalkeeper\ncame in for some criticism from the\ncrowd. That evening much beer was\ndrunk. Our captain was seen to be involved with a young woman. But as he's how married, we wont talk about that.\nBetter not speak ill of the dead.\nTRIALS Each club will~ ive details of\ntheir trials at the Fresher's Reception.\nFor the benefit of Soccer,\nRugby and Hockey players, their trials will be held at the College Sport's' Ground at Harlington, Hiddx. on Wednesday and Saturday Oct. 5th and 6th commencing 2.30p.m. H.B. If you prefer to go to the\nUniversity Trials please do, we shall hear about you in_ any ca3e. Remember\nthe University standard is high.\nThere will be coaches on both\ndays FOR FRESHERS JULY, leaving from the\nUnion.

    "content": "FELIX Lear Sir, Every alternate Friday last\nsession I was greeted by a rotund,red-faced in div dual with a large voice and\na large beard,who tried to sell me aPe lix. At lunch-time we had an Ail American, Eas t \u00a32ndi News vendor who practised the mating call of the hyena as\nhe tried to boost the c?.ls3 of his rag. This un k emc t, unshaven, i unwashed, undressed,gibbering maniac,took it as\na personal affront if one did not purchase aPe lix. But this was not my only reason for not buying Peli x. Being of Scott ish ancestry,I naturally examine anything for which I am expected to pay\nlf d, to see if it is worth that much. I fear that Peli x is not.\nThe sports coverage in Peli x is usually 10 days out of date. The\ncomment and letters usually cover\nsome interminable political wrangle\nin the rat-race for the Union Dictatorship. The humour is trivial and\nchildish. The gossip column i3 concerned entirely with people who live in the Hostel,and most of them are\nunknown to me.\n1 appreciate that covering\nall the news in College is very difficult. Also it is clear that writ ii ag' articles of interest for people who\nhave no interests is nearly impossible\nhowever I am sure that the situation\ncould be improved with a little con r side ration and effort. May I close on a note of\ncommendation? I think the reviews of\nfilms and plays currently running in London is a good idea and it should\npersuade more people to take advantage of the facilities which are pro-vi ded. Yours Faithfully, D,T.

They didn't take advantage of the\nenormous, number of clubs and societies( which,by the way,provide facilities for everything from rugby to underwater swim-ming, from Marxism to Catholicism.),spent\ntheir three years here without taking\nany interest in the Union,and disappeared,\nhalf-educated,'into the larger field of\nlife,\"u wept, un honoured and unsung.\" This\nstill happens.\nThe main end,of o our se, of a University\ne duo ation is the obtaining of a degree.\nBut this is by no means the only end, A University must\"claim,not only that it is entitled to grant certificates of academic standard,but also that it's graduates\nare of ao ert a in worth in other fields them the academic Those who lay the onus\nof student apathy on the college author-i ties are,we feel,misdirected.

These\nare the members of the National Blood\nTransfusion Service and a unit from the\nSouth London Centre will be visiting this College again early in November.\nMy reason for writing this article is to\nask you to take advantage of the unique\nfao iH ties which they offer and to enrol\nas a Flood Donor, if you have not already\ndone so. However, just in case my\nrather horrific introduction has given\nyou some mi3sa pre hens ions let me add a few more facts. Firstly the process is quite painless, any donor will tell you\ntills. ' After a few preliminary items\nof red tape you take up your position\non the couch and present either v our right or.your left arm, whichever suits you best. The doctor then makes the\nnecessary insertions which at the most\no an be felt as a small pin prick just\nbelow the elbow joint. You then lay in peace for about ten minutes, flexing the\nmuscles of your fore-arm to help the\ncirculation. When the doctor has re moved the apparatus you transfer yourself\nto another couch for a further ten minute period after which you are at liberty to claim a free cup of tea with biscuits. What else do you gain besides\ntea and biscuits?

Irehaps he will now admit\nthat the\"D \"stands for \"Lwight\".\nThe new Physics block is to be opened by Sir John Cockroft on 0c to ber20th. It has been finished very quickly, being\nonly a year late. We await with interest\nthe unveiling of the hieroglyphics above the front entrance.

We\nhope that the standard of the art i cles is an improvement on last years\nrather uninspiring effort, for, if not.\nthe average student may well spend\nhis l/6d on more mundane things.\nWe hear that Kr.Kooney,our respected refectory manager,spent part of his\nsummer holidays on a yacht,sailing in the English Channel. Apparently he in tended to visit the Isle of. Wight,but\nnot for the five days, that it took to\nhave some damage put right, this was\ncaused by an ex-miner who, as navigator,\nthought that the best way to encircle\nthe Isle* of Wight' was to plow 'straight\nthrough-the coastline, ler hap s Ix.\nMooney will commemorate the event by\nintroducing a new delicacy on the refectory menu by the name of \"Fricasse d 'Isle\nBlanche\".\nV/e await with apprehension the^arriva x of thousands upon thousands of pink\ncherubs.\nPerhaps this years council will make\nsome attempt at running the Union,and\nnot ruining it, as did last years.
