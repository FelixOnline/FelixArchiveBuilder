All candidates were allowed 300 words and have been\nlisted jn alphabetical order throughout.\nPRESIDENT\nJOHN EAST X am Standing for President to putt across other\npoli dies in the interests of students, these are i Grants:\nNo action whatsoever has been (taken Whits year 'to\nsecure the aims of the campaign. To win a higher grant\nwe must move away from a campaign based on protest\npolitics, or press u rising the Viee-Chancellors and other\n\"allies\" of students. Throughout the country (these\npeople have shown that they are on the side of the\nGovernment, not of Students.\nIt is time for us to realise that only direct action\nproduces results (c.f.( the re-in statement of Joe Cotter at\nKent University by an Occupation). We must use all\napplicable methods to i win, Ithese 'include Refectory\nBoycotts, Rent Strikes, Lecture Boycotts, Demonstrations, Sit-ins, etc.\nAccommodation and other cutbacks in Education :\nIf we win Ithe Grants Campaign, we are likely to: find\nthe money eaten up by higher rents, food prices, etc.\nThere will also be a general cutback lin (the facilities in\nthe college because of the cult tin Social Expenditure\nannounced at Christmas.\nWe must fight against these cutbacks, and against\nhigher costs, because it is no use having a higher grant,\nif lit is immediately eaten up by higher prices, and if Ithe\nfacilities to study in deteriorate.\nOverseas Students:\nThese students must be drawn into i the union more,\nand as the only candidate Who has any links with Ithem\nand who has been active on their behalf, I believe I can\ndraw them in.\nI have proposed a motion for NUS Conference about\noverseas students calling for Full Grants for all students\nof all nationalities and deploring the proposed increase\nin Overseas Students fees.\nBecause no other candidate is putting i or ward these\npolicies, I urge you to vote for me as President, for a Democratic, Fighting, Union.\nPHIL HEMME NS I.C.U. needs a President capable of returning control\nand debate to the floor of the Union. It needs someone\nseeking an alternative forum for discussion, such that\nUnion policy is given the time for formulation by the\nstudents Whom it will represent.\nlit needs someone capable of sustaining goodwill between the C. C.U. 'is and I.C.U., such that I.C.U. is kept\ninformed of current student opinion, and thus sever the\nneed for C. C.U. 'is to become political pressure groups,\nenabling Ithem to resume i their original roles.\nlit needs someone to opt i mise the workings of I.C. Council, reducing Ithe number of members to a more\nrealistic Size for a decision making body.\nIt needs someone to accelerate our acquisition of\nUnion Flats and Houses 'in times when loans for the\nnew Halls are far from forthcoming, through someone\nwho will continue the search for such loans.\nIt needs someone fighting Ito increase our self-sufficiency, with control over Our Bar and Refectory.\nIt needs someone willing to use every communication-al aid in i the interests of exec/student/college relations.\nI.C.U. needs a President willing to con cent himself\nwith fighting for the needs of I.C. students, and through\nthis for all students.\nI think I am the President you need: I hope you agree.\nT. JOHNSON\nFailed to produce a manifesto\u2014Ed.\nTREVOR PHILLIPS\nExternal Affairs, I.C.;U. L.U. Executive; Joint Committee Senate and Students.\nii) Confidence in the Union leadership (exec and Council) is low, this is a chance Ito restore it.\nlii) Long-overdue improvement in the Union's financial and admin structure are taking place; services are\nbeing expanded and i stream M ned. iii) The aftermath of the General Election, definitely\nrestrictive, with the threat Ito Union autonomy and\nreduced likelihood of Government action on Grants.\nClearly how effectively we are able to react to\nlatter, depend on the first i two aims toeing successful.\nThe crucial thing here is i the question of leadership.\nThis falls primarily on i the President, Executive and\nCouncil. 1 see i the President's role as fourfold: initiator\nof policy, iGO-or d in at or of Unlion activities, negotiator\nand representative at College, University and National\nlevels, and as an administrator.\nIt's not always possible for the President to be avail-able. Maybe visits Ito labs, etc., would toe a good idea\u2014\nit would also help to have a President who was easily\nrecognisable (plug, plug).\nThe Exec should be expanded to include PG officer\nand a woman (President of I. C.W. A.),( the Office Manager as an observer, and possibly the E AO and Chairman of the Floor Reps. This makes an executive of\nnunc, possibly eleven; given a degree of commitment, toy\nthe Exec, this is not unwieldy. I would like Ito see Exec\nmembers holding specific responsibilities, e.g. overseas\nStudents, catering, and would introduce Itermly \"Exec\nweekends\" to review policy and plan for next term.\nCouncil is not too big; it just buggers about too much.\nMajor campaigns, grants, student houses, catering,\nacademic affairs.\nThe above policies can only be carried out by a strong, autonomous Unlion. The prerequisite lis a good\nteam of Union Officers who are committed to the\nUnion's work. So volt e, and vote carefully.\nHON. SECRETARY\nJ. GERRARD( nee Brown)\nToday and tomorrow the voting for i the posts of\nPresident, Hon. Secretary, Deputy President and Felix/\nPublication Officer will take place. The job I am Standing for (secretary) mainly involves being Returning\nOfficer ait all next year's I.C.U. elections, sitting on\nnumerous committees including Union Finance and\nCouncil and also the organisation of some of these.\nApart from all this, many Other small, but i time con-sumi ug, jobs arise.\nThe experience I have gained this year as an active\nmember of I.C.U. and R.C. S.U.,I feel, has certainly\nequipped me for a job of this nature. I am at present\nJunior Treasurer ot f R.C.S. Unlion and hence have\nplayed an important role on many committees and am\nfamiliar With the administration of unions.\nThe administration of I.C. Union is for ever getting\nmore complex: Ithe turnover is increasing annually. The\nprospects of taking over i the un lion building refectory\nand bar, the Southside shop and the bookshop are\ngoing ito present even more problems. Hence it lis\nessential that someone with financial experience is\nelected on Ito i the executive.\nNext year the Felix editor will also toe taking on the\nextra job of Publication Officer. Much of this lin the\npast has (fallen to the Hon. Secretary ito dp, hence to\nmaintain continuity, I will have to work in close liaison\nespecially at the beginning of the year, with this officer.\nI ItruSt you will all vote for me as someone who is\nrepresentative of the majority of Students alt this college.\nP. MORGAN This manifesto briefly lays out my ideas for improving\nI.C.U. through the position of Honorary Secretary.\nUG Ms The most Obvious area for reform lis at i the Union\nGeneral Meetings. Lowering the quorum is self defeating\nand reduces i the representative ness of the UG Ms which\nis the overall governing and policy making body of the\nUnion.\nThe meetings themselves must be improved. Procedure must toe cult Ito a minimum to get on with the\nbusiness in hand. Long motions with many parts should\nbe replaced by shorter motions to reduce long and boring debates.\nExecutive reports must be concise and strictly factual\nand introduce no new business. To reduce disorder and\ntime wasting i the Standing orders must be strictly applied\nby the chair.\nStudents tend to only come Ito union meetings which\ndirectly concern Ithem, by trying to cut down on political\nmotions and introducing more I.C. related motions and\nby a lot of hard work toy the Exec, we can get quo rate meetings again.\nCCUs\nDue to i the failure of I.C.U. tills year i the C.C. U.S have become much more political. If Ithis trend continues it could result in I.C.U. splitting into three fac-t ions. The C. CU.s are much more effective 'in their\nroles as social institutions (organising rag, etc.) and\nconveying opinions to I.C.U. from the grass roots.\nGrants\nI fully support Ithe NUS grants campaign. We need\nmore executive action in organising the campaign within I.C. If a decision has been taken to hold a Rent\nStrike say, or there is a demonstration, regardless of\npersonal opinion, the executive must take i the most\neffective action to organise i the action.\nSabbaticals\nThe purpose of a sabbatical year is not to take a year\noff to improve one's degree (as some candidates seem\nto think). The year should be spent in trying to improve\nI.C.U. These are my plans for I.C.U. But remember, whether\nyou vote for me or not. For I.C.U. VOTE. DEPUTY PRESIDENT\nR. KILL Ron Rill has, for the past year, been the Vice-President of R. C.S.U., which has enjoyed a more successful\ntime it his year than ever. I know from first-hand knowledge that this success is due in no small way ito Ron's enthusiasm and capabilities. In Ithe past the C. C.U. Vice-Presidents have dealt almost solely with Rag. This\nyear Ron has not only produced Ithe best R.C.S. Carnival\nperformance of recent times but has also taken a full\npart as a member of the R.C.S. Exec., Widening the\naspect of the posit of Vlice-l Preside n it as never 'before.\nAs chairman of Ithe R.C.S. Clubs* committee, Ron has\ndemonstrated the ability to deal with people of widely\nvarying interests. Coupled with the administrative knowledge he gained as secretary of Tizard Hall last year,\nthis ex i peri en ce gives Ron a solid foundation from which\nto tackle a job which I believe he can do very well.\nOne of his primary aims will be the tightening up of\nsecurity in the Union areas. In the last year the Union\nExec, have been confronted with a sharp increase is.\nviolent incidents. This must toe checked before someone\nis seriously injured.\nMore frequent card checks by duty officers lin tooth,\nthe Union and Soulthslde, and a ban on large outside\nconferences which have been associated with many of\nthis year's incidents would go some way Ito doing (this.\nI hope that these few words, the hustings, and personal knowledge will persuade YOU to VOTE, and to\nVOTE for RON KILL, who I know is the (best man.\nfor Ithe job.\nPaul Gee {Proposer*\nJ. WOOD Jim lis a second year student in Electrical Engineering,\nwhose entry into University was delayed by a Itraineeship with a leading electrical engineering company.\nFor the past 'two years Jim has been a very friendly\nand approachable leading light In one of i the student\nhouses in Evelyn Gardens and currently runs his house's bar as well as sitting on the house committee.\nUp to now he hasn't taken a vast interest in the\npolitical side of the Union's affairs and firmly believes\nthat [politics 'doesn't come Into his ideas on running the\nUnion from the Deputy President's post. He is often tobe seen somewhere in i the Union building or bar and\nhaving enjoyed the social side of his two years at I.C. he now wants to put something back into I.C.U. He\nwants to protect the interests of ordinary fellow uni ott members enabling Ithem to have a good time, using f the Union building as THEIR OWN( building, and using if c to its fullest potential. Last year he was present at the\nHustings when he proposed his brother, Bill Wood, for\nPresident Of I.C.U., and now sincerely hopes you wit give him i the opportunity to work for you ALL as\nDeputy President.\nFELIX/PUBLICITY\nM. WILLIAMS First, lets make it clear that i the sabbatical post for\nwhich I am standing has had its role modified: i the new\npul b Mcl ty/ put olli cations officer will toe Ithe co-or d in at or for\nthe communications media and publications of I.C.U. \u2014\nFelix, .Stdic, EC. Radio, -the Bluebook, Union Directory*\nPhoenix, Ragsmag, etc., i though he will only have direct,\ncontrol over Felix as Editor.\nI have been Interested in publicity and communications ever since arriving at I.C. and last year I set up\na Council working party to get some ideas on how to\nimprove publicity and communications. One prop os at was that the publicity officer's role should toe expanded\nand re-defined. The idea of having it sabbatical came\nmuch later.\nDespite Ithe cock-up by last year's Felix editor over\nthe .Rag-mag, I still managed ito produce it single-bloody-handed. I learned a hell u val olt about editorial,\nlayout and the process of publication during that 'period.\nClearly one has to ask what I intend to do if elected;\n1. Work hard at the job and do it properly.\n2. Establish a solid communication network\namongst the media of I.C.3. Search ou it every possible method of improving\nattendances at UG Ms and stimulating interest\nin I.C.U. The next question is: Where do I stand politically?\nThe answer lis I don't! Politics has its place in I.C.U.. but debate will be fruitless if tooth sides are always at\nan impasse. I should like to re-Structure UG Ms so that\nthis is less likely to happen.\nI'd like to sum up my saying that if I get elected, I shall work damned hard. There'll be no odd afternoons\nspent lal tU.L.U. looking for extra perks. I shall Ibe\naccessible all day, every day.\nThanks for listening.\nC. WRIGLEY I am standing for Ithis post because over the year*\nFelix has been an ill read, much abused paper. Why?\nSimply because successive Editors have been out of\ntouch with I.C. students. From the Felix Office in the\ntop of the Union Building it has been too easy to aspire\nto the mighty clouds of journalism, but College life m, down here on Ithe campus. The three years I have bee a alt college have given me every opportunity to know\npeople and the college way of life. I have managed l College publications 'before and have only met wit fe success. If Felix is for i the students of I.C. then I feel\nI am more than capable of taking on the job. Also, next\nyear, due to a proposed change to Offiselt-Litho the jot*\nis going to i take on a more practical nature and hera\nagain I feel I am in a capable position of offering the\nnecessary expertise and know how.\nNow ito move on to, perhaps (the better half of i the job: put oli city. The state of I.C. Union at the moment its\nappalling and only promises to get worse. I hope ne xl year leadership will appear, but it will only toe com* frustrated without the right support. Communication*\nare, as every candidate for a sabbatical post back M$ the year dot 'has said, very essential. Good, but as Publicity Officer this would now toe specifically my lot ani as such I feel I could capably utilise all the media at\nmy disposal: why for publicity read posters where the w are things like Felix, STOIC or even Student Radii\u00bb\navailable alt our disposal. AH of these can i be co-or d in at ed under effective leadership to provide com pre hens iv* broadcasting of all I.C. Unlion news and events.\nSo unless you want all communication to come dow*\nwith Moses from the mountain make sure you vote for\nme, Charlie Wrigley, today or tomorrow.\n\n"

Since then she has regularly topped\nthe polls in the music papers, despite\nspending most of the time without making any appearances on record, stage\nor in print.\nShe has not, however, been resting\nsince then. She has in fact made three\nalbums. The first two were scrapped in\nher search for a successful debut album.\nSatisfied, she had now released that al-bum, ' QUEEN OF THE NIGHT.' and\nthe search was worth it.\nIn this album she displays her singing\ntalents to the fullest, with a wide range\nof varied tracks, chosen after a weekend\nspent listening to over 250 songs.\nTo do full justice to all the tracks\nwould take far more space than is avail-able. However, to pick out a \"best\"\ntrack would be almost impossible.\n\" A Woman Left Lonely\" (side one,\ntrack two) is a soulful number, fairly\ntypical of a lot of the album. \"Souven-irs\" (John Prine's number) has a lot\nmore power in it, not just from Maggie's vocals but also from the brass and\nkeyboards in the backing.\n\"Oh My My\"( Ringo Starkey) is the\nopening cut on side two and the one\nchosen for release as a single. A good\nchoice (if she feels that it is necessary\nto release one) though not one in which\nher full talents are used. \"As The Years\nGo Passing By,\" the backing to the\nsingle, is much more indicative of her\ncapabilities. Hopefully this will be given\nas much air play as the ' A' side.\nOverall, the album is well balanced,\nand could, when it has been fully listened to. become a classic.\nAn album I would definitely recommend and congratulations to Scotland\non producing such talent. (PS Hope they\nwin the Cup also).\nOld lew\nand Blue\nSLADE. Is there really any point in\nsaying much more about their latest\noffering \" OLD NEW BORROWED AND BLUE,\" The chances of anyone\nreading this who have not at some time\nheard them is very slim indeed.\n1 have had little contact with previous Slade albums but what little 1 have\nhad has convinced me that if I wanted a Slade album for my collection it would\nnot matter which I had, They're all\nmore or less alike; both to each other\nand from track to track.\nOn the latest album there is only two\ncuts, 'Everyday' and 'Find Yourself A Rainbow' that stand out as being differ-ent.\n'Everyday' is a much slower, more\nsubtle number than the remainder. Not\na fast rocking number, more of one that\nshould be listened too, not heard.\n'Find Yourself A Rainbow' is^ a hon-ky-tonk number with accompanying\npiano.\nThe remainder are typical Slade num-be rs, loud, rocky, and (such as 'My\nFriend Stan\") fairly well known. Noddy\nHolder's vocals scream out just as usual,\nalthough Jimmy Lea is given a chance\non two1 of the tracks.\nSlade are really a live band. They\ngenerate excitement and develop it to a high level, but to do that they need to\nbe playing on stage to an audience. Here\nthey come into their own. On record,\nhowever, they lose out. This record\ncould not be described as bad. But, you\neither like Slade. or you don't; take your\nchoice.\nANSWERS TO X WORD in last issue\n' Across: 1 Ungainly; 5 Akin; 9 Lease; 10\nCaJibre; 11 Impenetrable; 13 Forage; 14\nIsland; 17 Special Agent; 20 Outflow; 21\nAcIIib; 22 Tairt; 23 Eyesores.\nDown: 1 Ugly; 2 Grammar; 3 Iceberg\nField; 4 Locket; 6 Kebab; 7 Need Einds; 8\nAlarm Signal; 12 Offshoot; 15 Annular; 16\nSlowly; 18 Enter; 19 Ebbs.\nCONCERTS\nMAN\nMan first appeared at 1C in January,\n'72 supporting Stone the Crows\u2014a gig\nfor which they were paid, I believe, \u00a340.\nThe Felix review the following week\nsaid \"I should like everybody to know\nabout a group called Man . . . they must\nhave been delighted with their reception\nin the Great Hall . . . the subtle use of\ndynamics prompts me to stick my neck\nout and say that in a years time they\nwill be as big as Yes.\"\nI should know \u2014 I was the reviewer.\nIt's now two years later and in terms of\nbigness my prophecy hasn't material-is ed. However I 've wanted to put the\nband on again for a long time and last\nweekend, when they cost me rather\nmore than forty quid, I was not dis-appointed. Musically Man are now all\nthat Yes were for me in those far-off\ndays and 1 hold the opinion (one that I don't expect everyone to share) that they\nare Britain's best active band.\nTo classify Man's music it is inevitable that I should make comparisons.\nUnfortunately the groups I allude to will\nprobably only be familiar to those who\nare Man fans anyway, but here goes\u2014\nFrank Zappa, Pink Floyd, Quicksilver\nMessenger Service, the Allman Brothers\nBand. But Man don't copy them\u2014can\nyou follow that?\nMan are at present Micky Jones (gui-tar) and Terry Williams (drums) who\nhave remained with the group throughout its many personnel changes, Ken\nWhaley (bass) and Malcolm Morley\n(electric piano) both ex-Help Yourself,\nand Deke Leonard (guitar) who was\nwith the group, along with Micky, Terry\nand bassist Martin Ace, that played\nhere before, and left shortly afterwards,\nand has only just rejoined. Although\nMicky Jones's guitar has been Man's hallmark during the last two years\nand he plays real good, Deke just cuts\nhim blind \u2014 he has a fluidity, a devastating range of sounds, and can play at\nblistering speed when he wants to.\nThere's no reason why the current lineup should stay together forever but with\nthese two guitarists in the band\u2014give\nthem eighteen months and, I say again.\nMan will be as big, not just as good, as\nYes.\nThey opened the show with \"Ameri-can Mother,\" a Malcolm Morley toon,\nI think, as he sang it. I haven't heard it\nbefore, and I don't yet have strong opinions on the number. The vocals were\ndelivered in a manner reminiscent of\nLou Reed's, and this similarity was\nechoed by Morley's appearance. This\nwas followed by \"7171551\" from Deke's album \"Iceberg,\" which was rather rep it it io us in places. Morley's 'Blown Away'\nwhich appeared on a Help Yourself al-bum, was less intense than most of the\nmusic, and the group sounded quite different when playing in a laid-back\nstyle. At about this point the audience\nreally came alive and \"C 'mon\" was received with rapturous applause. It began with a section very similar to the\nFloyd's \"Echoes\" or \"Saucerful of Secrets\" and went on for nearly half-an-hour.\nSome people I spoke to afterwards\nmade the criticism that some of the\nnumbers went on too long.\nTwo of Deke's shorter numbers fol-lowed. \"Hard Way to Live\" and \"Re-main\" which I don't think the band\nhave played since he left before. It is, I believe, the story of how he was beaten\nup by a Belgian customs man.\n\"This is a rave from the grave\" announced Micky, and it was \"Bananas,\"\nmostly taken at a furious pace, but\nagain over 20 minutes long. The length\nof tracks did not, I should add, seem to\nworry most of the audience. After\n\"Bananas\" they left the stage. Would\nthey leave without \"Spunk Rock\"? No\nway. Back they came for another go at\nthe definitive rock jam. Unequalled, in\nmy opinion, for sheer coherence and\nexcitement, by any group on either side\nof the Atlantic. Listen to the version on\nthe long-deleted \"Greasy Truckers Party\" LP or, failing that, on Man's \"Back\nInto the Future\" and you know what I mean.\nAfter \"Spunk Rock\" they finished.\nMan had played for over two hours.\nSID.\nBooks\nMICHAEL GREEN\nril til i Mm Mm\nCIUANTU^A AUDIO\nWe can now offer students a comprehensive range of Hi-Fi, P.A., Disco and Light Show Equipment* at lowest possible prices.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX 5th March 1974\nSOCIETIES' PAGE SAILING CLUB MEDITATION\nA couple of Wednesdays ago saw the premature ending of our\n'home' sailing season, it\nhas been confirmed by\nthe Water Board that it\nwas not just I.C. boats\nwhich caused the dam\nwall to crack \u2014 U.C. helped! Anyway, the\nHarp is now half-filled\nwith mud, much of\nwhich is now decorating\nthe tops of mainsails of\nI.C. boats. Now that sailing is finished and\neverybody is feeling depressed and wondering\nwhere all the subs will\ngo, well they need wonder no more for the\npowers that be have\ndecided that a new race\nbox is to be built further\nalong the Harp.\nSo what has happened\nover the last year? The\nteam, captained by\nTweedy (Scrap-It) Rogers has beaten just\nabout everybody in sight\nEXCEPT teams from\nCambridge, Birmingham\nand Reading (only one\nrace sailed). This gives\nan overall result sheet\nof 181 won, 2i lost.\nThere has been the\nusual sprout of disqualifications, capsizes and\nbreakages (Southamp-ton remarked at the\nsheer muscle power of\nthe I.C. team when seeing one member pulling\non the kicking strap to\nbend the mast and end\nup breaking the boom.\nStill, Cambridge were\nnot to be left out of the\nbreak-down stakes when\ntwo masts disintegrated\nand decks pulled off).\nNow for the future\u2014\nwell there are still a few\naway matches to come,\ni.e. Bath, Bristol, and\nthen in three weeks'\ntime is the event of the\nyear \u2014 the Bradford\nBarrel. I.C. has won this\ncompetition for the last\ntwo years and we are\nconfident of the hat-trick.\nNeedless to say, both\nthe I.C. in tei collegiate\ncup between Mines,\nR.C.S. and Guilds (who\nusually dominate) and\nthe U.L equivalent, the\nCastaways Cup have had\nto be postponed. It is\nhoped these trophies\nwill eventually be sailed\nfor early next year.\nThe Wednesday League \u2014 again for the\nnth year running I. C.1st team won the 1 St league.\nI.C. seconds came runners up in the second\nleague after losing to a Bart's team in the last\nrace.\nAnd now for something entirely different\u2014\nthe SOCIAL EVENT OF\nTHE YEAR. The I. C.S.C. Annual Dinner\u2014guest\nspeaker Olympic silver\nmedallist David Hunt\n(also of Needlespur\nfame). The price is \u00a32\nand tickets can be obtained from any committee member or Tizard\n555. This is expected to\nbe a really good do with\nplenty of booze,( females)?, chat, argument and food.\nAT ARE T STERS ABOUT\nTrying to sell ce ili dh tickets to people, we\nhave often been asked:\n\"What is ace ili dh?\", so,\nas we can't expect you\nto come to something\nthat 'could be anything\nfrom a talk on the habits\nof ancient Egyptians to\nan exhibition of Irish\nwalking sticks (think\nabout it), I am here to\ntell you about our\nce ili dh. Firstly, ace ili dh is a Folk Dance. Folk dancing is the English version of the Scots Eightsome Reels and Irish\nJigs. We here apologise\nto any Celts who have\ntaken offence at this\ncomparison. Don't be\nput off by dances with\nnames such as \"Gather-ing Peascods\" (or something like that), 'cos it\nhas\u2014as far as I can see\n\u2014nothing whatsoever to\ndo with gathering peas-cods or anything else for\nthat matter. Neither do\nyou have to worry about\nnot knowing What to do\n\u2014 when dancing of\nbourse, silly\u2014because\nthere's a \"caller\" on\nstage, that is a man who\ncalls out which steps to\ndance at the appropriate\ntime. The steps themselves are not difficult,\nand i they fit easily into\nthe music, so there is\nno need to worry about\nnot being able to dance.\nAnd as for looking a bit\nstupid, everyone else\nthere too looks just the\nsame, so no one notices,\nthey just enjoy them-selves.\nNow, about the Yetties. They are not, contrary to common opinion,\nteddy bears off Doctor\nWho. They are a folk\ngroup \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 and they play\ntraditional country dance\nmusic. They are very\nwell known\u2014shame on\nthose of you who haven't heard of them, you don't read our posters! \u2014 and\nare good. They are competent musicians, who\nunderstand their music,\nwhich as you probably\nknow, is important. But\nyou don't have to believe\nme, borne to the ce ili dh and see for yourself. The\nYetties come from Dorset, so if you come from\nthe West Country, come\nand support your compatriots \u2014 we're a min-or it y. The Yetties have\nplayed at many famous\nfolk music events including Folk at Eton, and\nthe International Folklore\nFestival at Sidmouth;\nnow they're here on\nyour doorstep, in the\nJ. C.R. to be precise.\nThey are recommended\nfor ce ili dhs, that's why\nwe booked them for\nours.\nThose of you who\nwent to the I. C.W. A.ce ili dh last term will\nknow all this, so if\nyou've read this \u2022 far,\nplease come to our\nce ili dh, it should be as\ngood, 'cos we helped\norganise that one. If\nyou've never been to ace ili dh before, come to\nthis one, it's a fun way\nto spend (the last Wednesday of term \u2014 who\nwants to work then any-way? Or any other for\nthat matter! The ce ili dh is open to anyone who\ncares to come, so feel\nwelcome.\nAt the college there are a wide\nvariety of extra-curricular activities\navailable which supposedly enrich\nour lives beyond the limitations of\nlecture room and Chemistry lab. One\nof these \"fringe\" activities Which\nseems to have found its niche in the\ncollege over the past couple of years\nalongside Caving Club and Wellsoc\nis Transcendental Meditation. Something for the reclusive few you might\nthink but a recent snippet of information which dropped my way via a somewhat dubious handout, made\nyour intrepid Felix reporter decide to\ntake-goat-skin and map of the Himalayas in hand and find out a little\nmore. The snippet of information?\u2014\na survey of students' exam performance found that those who took up\nTranscendental Meditation showed a significant increase in their marks\nwhich continued to grow as they continued to meditate.\nEventually, said Felix reporter\ntracked down former I.C. student\nStephen Giles, who after graduating\nspent some time with Maharishi\nMohesh Yogi\u2014who started the whole\nthing off, and is now a teacher of the\nmeditation. I posed him a question or\ntwo :\nQ Most students have very little\ntime: what is involved in Transcendental Meditation?\nA About 15 minutes morning and\nevening once you've actually-learnt.\nQ And how long does that take?\nA Four sessions of about two hours.\nQ Well how can the two daily sessions affect exam performance, do\nthey help you concentrate better?\nA They do actually, although one\ndoesn't practice concentration during\nthe meditation, quite the opposite in\nfact. The main effect though is to\nmake your thinking much clearer so\nthat you absorb and use information\nmore easily, more effectively. You\ndon't actually gain any new informal\ntion when you learn to meditate, just\na simple technique Which when practised regularly enables you to assimilate information better. There is a surfeit of information in the college,\na large number of minds. What is\nneeded is a means of expanding the\nconscious capacity of the minds so\nthat they can absorb more of the information in a meaningful way \u2014\nthat'sTM. Q What degree did you get?\nA A third (laughter). I was very involved with Union activities when I was here so didn't do much work,\nbut what I found was that after starting to meditate I remembered much\nmore from the lectures, it wasn't so\nnecessary to cram. Taking finals\nwasn't really too much of a strain.\nQ Students' personal problems\ntend to affect their work situation?\nA Right. On this level alone TM can make a big difference. Practising\nTM produces a more balanced person-ali ty. Introverts get on better with\nother people.\nQ How does meditation do that?\nA It very much reduces the level of\nstress and tension in the nervous s ys tem. Consequently one is less wor-ried, feels happier and things just go\nmore easily. You sometimes experience this when you're not practising\nmeditation if you're well rested and\nfeeling fresh, everything goes much\nmore easily, little upsets don't put\nyou off. During the meditation you\nget a deeper rest than the deepest\nsleep which re vital is es the system, as\na result you are more alert and stay\nalert longer.\nQ Doesn't this, alertness, more\npowerful thinking, etc., tend to put\nother people off you?\nA No, the opposite. Everyone\nenjoys being with happy, successful\npeople. Meditating certainly helps\none to get on with members of the\nopposite sex (laughter). The development is very natural and makes one\nmore sensitive to other people. It\ndoesn^t just enlarge all aspects of a person's personality irrespective of\ntheir influence on other people.\nQ What does the college society\ndo\u2014are there students who teach the\nmeditation?\nA No. You have to learn from a teacher trained by Maharishi, but the\ncollege society tries to make information about the meditation available,\nfacilitate people learning it and make\nsure those practising it are getting\nmaximum benefit.\nBOOKWEEK\nYou may have been\npresent at the ''Great Debate\" held a couple of\nweeks ago or you may\nnot, but almost certainly\nyou saw some bump h for\nit either on a poster or on\nthe pages of Felix, CEF E or Good News. Entitled\n\"This House Believes\nChristianity is False Consciousness\", didn't you\npause to wonder how to\ndefine consciousness? I know a great deal of the\ndebate spotlighted this\nissue, of course I can't say\nwhether the conclusions\non the meaning of the\nword were correct or not,\nit's suitably vague to defy\nprecise definition.\nBut how many people\npaused to consider the\nword Christianity, what\ndoes it mean? Surely this\nis a far more vital word.\nDoes it describe . . . well\nwhat? A moral code? A religion? A way of life? I think that the term has\nbeen devalued over recent\nyears. Admittedly it can't be defined in a single\nphrase, but it's not \"what\nyou want it to mean.\"\nDuring the week of\nMarch 11-17 Christians\nat this college are providing you with the opportunity to find out more\nabout Christianity in a\" book week\". One of the books concerned in this venture is\ncalled \"Basic Christianity\"\nby J. Stoot and gives, as\nits title implies, an outline\nof what Christianity is and\nwhat Christians stand for.\nThere will be a book-stall stationed around college and lots of people\nwilling to talk to you and\nanswer your questions on\nany aspects of the subject,\nfrom their personal experience and they'll also be\nable to furnish you with\nbooks Which will be able\nto answer your questions\nin depth.\nPete Thomas\n\n"

These people have committed no offence\nbut are detained simply for expressing views of which\ni heir governments disapproved. They are often tortured and frequently held in cramped cells with far\ntoo HMe food.\nAmnesty International was formed 12 ye an s ago to\ncampaign for the release of prisoners of conscience.\nThe organisation carries out research on prisoners\nand provides information for local groups, each of\nwhich adopts a few prisoners and works for Itheir re-lease.\nWherever possible, groups provide moral and financial support for prisoners' families; last year \u00a385,000\nwas spent on welfare work and further considerable\nexpenditure is necessary to maintain research. It is\nimportant that Amnesty should be completely independent of Government assistance in order to maintain\nthe impartiality upon which its reputation rests. The\norganisation thus relies heavily on the general public\nfor financial support. Local groups need to raise\nabout \u00a3140 a year to finance investigator y work on\nbehalf of their adopted prisoners.\nThe college group has responsibility for three pri-son ers: in Turkey, E. Germany and Indonesia, and\nwe are asking you to support us by sponsoring par-i ici par its in the three-day fast.\nTo further the identification we will be fasting outside Southside refectory for three days IN A CAGE, similar to those used in Vietnam, Brazil, South Africa,\netc. Come and see us; come and sponsor us; come and\nfast with us \u2014 our prisoners depend on your support.\nContact Averil Dewing (Selkirk 562); or Derek\nBarnes (phone 286 8847); or via Union Office.\ndepartments.\nFor the poll to be valid\n25% of the registered students at the college must\nvote. This means that\n1,037 votes must be cast.\nIf you want to vote then\ngo along to the nearest\nballot box and do so.\nYou will need a valid registration card. Remember, it is in your own interests to vote, It is\nridiculous to complain of\na non - representative\nUnion if you don't help\nchoose the representatives.\nAlso, last. Thursday,\nthe nomination papers\nwent up for a whole host\nof union posts. The posts\nare: \u2014 Academic Affairs\nOfficer, External Affairs\nOfficer, Student Residence\nOfficer, Welfare Officer,\nCommunity Action Group\nChairman, Carnival Coordinator, SCAB Chairman, Overseas Students\nCommittee Chairman,\nUNION\nGENERAL\nMEETING\nCONCERT HALL THUR S.

The hustings\nand the elections are held\nat the last U GM of term\nwhich is on March 14th. Departmental representative elections are also\nheld this week, on Friday\nin most departments.\nWatch out again for those\nwho are standing.

Anything that moves in the quad is fair\ngame, but passers-by at the rear of the Union and in\nPrince Consort Road are NOT. These silly people\ncaused the police to be called in, twice.

    "content": "5th March, 1974 FELIX Page 3\nFLOOR REPS\nlit has come to the notice\n\u2022of floor reps that a lot of\npeople in I.C. just do not\nknow what floor reps are,\nwho they are, and what\nthey do. What follows,\ni hen, is an attempt to enlighten the unenlightened.\nThere are six floor reps\non I.C.U. Council:\u2014\nJohn Berry\u2014Physics 3.\nCaroline Bingham \u2014\nPhysics 3.\nCharlie Lewis\u2014Mech.\nEng. 3.\nNigel Sedgwick\u2014Physics 3.\nPaul Watkins\u2014Mech.\nEng. PG. Mike Williams\u2014Chemistry 3.\nThere is a yawning\nchasm between the ideal it y and practicality of their\nposition, the blame for\nwhich chiefly lies at the\nfeet of the electorate.\nIdeally, they represent the\nviews of the ordinary\nUnion members and put\nforward ideas as such at\nCouncil and UGMs, In\npractice floor reps tend to\nhave their own particular\nviews and one then votes\nat the election (which\ntakes place at aUG M in\nthe summer term) for\nwhichever candidate represents one's own views the\nmost closely. Again ideally\nthe Union's rank and file\napproach the floor reps\nand ask them to put their\nviews on a particular\nissue forward; but in practice the rank and file are\nso bloody apathetic that\nthe floor reps have no\nchoice but to keep on\nslogging on with their own\nviews in the belief that\nthey broadly coincide with\nthat rare and diffuse entity\n\u2014the ^grass-roots opinion'.\nSo it appears that too\nmany people are content\nto pass the buck in terms\nof responsibility inasmuch\nas they themselves reap\nthe benefits from their efficiently run, well financed\nsocieties. Yes, it's( he root\nof the apathy syndrome.\nThe Union Floor Committee, consisting of the\nsix floor reps, was formed\nessentially to breach this\nyawning gap between\nideal it y and practicality,\nand to discuss the communications problems facing I.C.U. and the approaches to solving the\nsame.\nI can tell you that I have\na private wager that what\nfollows will be completely\ndisregarded by the smug\na path ites of I.C.: \"We\nneed your views. If you\nfeel strongly about something tell us; if you want\nto propose something at aUG M but are a bit Shy\nabout it. tell us. That's what we're here for\".\nO.K.I 've said it. So now\nthere's no excuse for not\nknowing what a floor\nrep's function is.\nMike Williams,\nFloor Rep.\nSEX ATTITUDES MUST\nBE HONEST\nIn the second of a series of World\nPopulation Year talks, organised by the\nFamily Planning Association, Professor\nNed Wagner of Washington University\nsaid that society must be more open and\nhonest about sexual behaviour. \"If a man has a heart attack, for example,\nthe doctors will tell him how soon he\ncould get up again, how much exercise\nto give various limbs, but not how much\nsexual activity he can have.\n\"Until August 1970 there was not a single study in medical literature on the\neffect of sexual intercourse upon a damaged heart\", he said. \"Even that is of\nlimited value in that it was carried out\non 14 middle-aged, middle-class American Jews, which is hardly representative\". Professor Wagner, who is on a sabbatical year from the university where he\nis Professor of Psychology and\nObstetrics/Gynaecology and Director of\nClinical Training in the Department of\nPsychology, also said that nobody in the\nworld has had sufficient sex education.\nThis leads to unwanted children who\noften grow up disturbed in some way.\nCriminals, assassins, etc., often fall into\nthis category.\nHe believes that this situation has\nbeen influenced by religious doctrine\nwhich links procreation with sex behaviour and therefore holds that sex\noutside marriage is bad. This grew up at\na time when pro-nat a list policies were\nnecessary. But he thinks that religion\nhas an important part to play in changing this attitude to a more realistic one.\nProfessor Wagner's guide lines for sex\neducation in schools are:\nSexuality is an integral part of an\nindividual's total personality; People\nhave a right to objective and full information about sexuality; Privacy concerning the personal behaviour of both\nstudents and teachers is sacrosanct;\nSexual behaviour which is held to be\nwithin the acceptable range will vary\nfrom person to person and from group\nto group. A concensus may not be pos-sib le. Divergent views should be respected if they are based on principles of\nhonesty and acceptability: Individuals\nwho teach sex education have a responsibility to be properly trained and\nqualified persons.\nProfessor Wagner summed up by saying that everyone has a right to knowledge of is ex to enable them to make\nchoices and not act out of ignorance.\nHe also made the point that parents are\noften inhibited by their own education\nand personal relationships in instructing\ntheir children and therefore more sex\neducation in schools was essential. He,\nfor instance, would much rather get the\nmessage across to his own three Children\n(aged 17, 11 and 10) by means of a lecture to a large audience than in\nprivate.\nRADIO SURVEY\nAs a lot of you will know by now, a survey was held throughout the halls of\nresidence regarding the setting up of a student radio station.\nBelow is a list of some of the questions thai were asked and the results that were\nobtained.\n1) Do you ever watch Stoic?\n3) How much of Felix do you\nusually read?\n5) Would you like I.C. to have its\nown radio?\n2) Do you read Felix regularly?\n4) Do you own a medium wave radio?\n6) Would you listen to such a Radio\nStation?\n10) Do you think I.C. should spend up to \u00a31,200 setting up such a station which\nwould cost \u00a3350 p.a. to run; Felix costs \u00a32,000 p.a.

Despite the\nunavoidable short notice quite a large\ncrowd turned up in the Great Hall to\nwatch the proceedings (I almost felt like\ncalling a Union Meeting on the spot).\nProf. Neal, the pro-rector, was in the\nchair and, due to his able chairmanship,\nthe meeting proceeded very smoothly\nindeed. There were representatives of\nthe three main parties. Miss S. Ward,\nrepresenting the Labour party in Chelsea, Mr. N. Clark, representing the Liberal party in the same constituency, and\nMr. R. Parsons, representing the Conservative party in Holborn and St.\nPancras.\nThe meeting was opened with a brief\nintroduction to each candidate followed\nby a talk from the same. Then questions\nwere asked, each candidate expressing\nsurprise at the range of questions asked\nand their depth. Unfortunately there\nwere far more questions written than U was possible to fit in the time available.\nHowever, again due to the chairmanship,\nseveral topics of interest to Staff and\nstudents alike, were asked.\nFollowing on from that, the elections\nhave now been held. Several people in\nthe college have been actively campaigning on behalf of candidates, ranging from Conservative, through Labour\nto an I.M.G candidate who (I was asked\nnot to mention the National F.... you\nknow who).\nNone of the three candidates, present\nalt the meeting were elected. Miss S. Ward polled 6,839, Mr. N. Clark 8,012,\nbut the Conservative candidate (Sir\nMarcus Wortley) polled 23,320. Mr. R. Parsons polled 8,223 as against the\nLabour candidates (Mrs. L.M. Jeger)\n12,414.\nI would like to take this opportunity\nto express my thanks to those who were\npresent, especially to Prof. Neal.\nP.A.W. Below, left to right: Miss S. Wawi.: N. Clark and R. 'Parsons.\nROOM BOOKINGS\nThere has been some\nconfusion over regulations\nregarding the booking of\nrooms in the Union. To\nclear this the following\npoints should be noted.\nCharges.

However, Wednesday, January\n30th saw most of i the London Colleges braving the\nnew hazard of mud for the\nfinal rounds of the intercollegiate leagues. In the\nfirst league the winners\nwere to be decided by a meeting between unbeaten\nI.C. first team and Queen\nMary College and in the\nsecond between I.C. second\nand St. Bartholomew's Hospital. I.C. first team\nwere lucky lin the first race\nto get a re-sail, due 'to incorrect starting by both\nteams, after Steve McQueen and Peter Barrett\ncapsized. However, in the\nnext two races I.C. won in\nStyle 1, 2 and 1, 3 respectively, thus winning the\nleague.\nThe I.C. second team\nalso ran into trouble in the\nfirSt race. Simon Briscoe\nand Richard Wood found\nit impossible to get off the\nshrove in time to start due\nto mud and though Richard Woods and Tony\nBambridge sailed well to\nfinish first they were Hater\ndisqualified for failing to\nstart corre dtl y. In i the second race I.C. finished 1st and 3rd by dirty sailing,\nbut lit was not good\nenough to make up the\npoints deficit and so I.C. second team finished runners up.\nAt the weekend the 3-boat team travelled down\nto the Hamble ito sail\nSouthampton University.\nUnfortunately they sailed\nwith a very weak team\nwhich presented no serious\nchallenge ito the more\nsuperior I.C. team. The\nfirst race was sailed in i the more Sheltered river. Al though Simon Briscoe\nsailed well at first he went\nfor the wrong leeward\nmark with a Southampton\nboat and finished fifth. The\nother two I.C. boats\n(Brian Rogers and Nigel\nCharlwood) finished first\nand second. After a visit\nto the local pub (your\nround, Malcolm) before\ntwo more races in Southampton Water, Tony\nBambridge sailed easily\ninto the lead (a Hamble\nfreeze?) with Richard\nWoods second and Brian\nRogers third. In i the final\nrace Nigel Charlwood\ndecided to sail back to the\nClub-house due to seasickness (?) leaving the\nother two IC boats battling for first and second\nplaces.\nIMPERIAL WINS GUT TE RIDGE CUP( AGAIN) IC 8, RF H0I. C. won their third\nconsecutive Gutteridge\nCup Final on February\n23rd in an indecisive man-ner.\nFrom the kick-off I.C. were in trouble due to\ntheir own mistakes (par-ti cula rly the forwards).\nRF H were given several\nchances to take the lead\nfrom penalty kicks, but\nmanaged to fluff them all\nwith the greatest of ease.\nAfter several narrow escapes (during which Flanegan claims to have dislocated his shoulder) I.C. got steadily back into the\ngame, and near half-time\ntook the lead when Martin Cotter made a break\nand fed the ball to Gerwyn Clement, who then\nbeat the full-back with\nthe slowest sidestep ever\nseen, to score near the\ncorner. Needless to say\nRay Hughes missed the\nconversion.\nThe second half followed the first half's pattern\nof indecisive play. I.C. were in trouble several\ntimes, but RF H couldn't make any headway (they\nmissed three kicks in\nfront of the posts) which\nwas particularly due to\nPete Tulrugges excellent\ndisplay at full back. I.C. managed to seal the game\nup, ten minutes from\nlime, when Ray Hughes\nkicked ahead, the full\nback got nowhere near it,\nand Bob Stern collected,\nbeat the full back and\npassed it to Gerwyn Clement {who happened to\nbe strolling along outside\nhim) to score his second\ntry (Guess who wrote\nthis). I.C. then managed\nto hold on, with the forwards now playing much\nbetter and the backs tackling well.\nAfter the match we had\nour usual celebrations,\nand we all got extremely\npissed. Also four of the\nplayers and supporters\nwent on \"Strike\" (subtle),\nand the police are also\nlooking for a5 ft. 11 in.\nWelshman who talks with\na slight Irish accent.\nTeam:\nPete Turbugge: Gerwyn\n(I scored two tries) Clement; Martin (I made both\ntries) Cotter; Bob (No,\nyou didn't Cotter) Stern;\nDenis (Curry Palace)\nShakesheff; Ray (Blind\nMan) Hughes; Chris (I 've\ngot three pots) Flanegan;\nBruce (punch a prop a day) Bradley; Jeff (I 've\ngot a pot at last) Hughes;\nDave ( ) Hart;\nKeith (I didn't want to go\nto Paris anyway) Lipscome; Steve (It's your\nchicken, my laugh) Booth;\nTony (Flaker) Walton;\nDicky (I 've broken the\nbone in my prick) Cresswell; Dave (I didn't touch\nhim Ref) Osborne.\nLinesman\u2014Neil (I wish\nI'd never got married)\nHicking. Many thanks to\nall the supporters who\nmade the effort to come\nout and support the team,\nincluding Pam.\nG. G.C. ROWING\nSaturday, 16th February\nsaw the boat club's first\ncompetitive venture of\nthis year. The occasion\nwas the old Southern Universities Championships,\nrenamed this year the\nSouthern Universities Regatta. It has been held\nsince 1967 and all three\ndivisions have thus far\neluded the grasp of I.C. No Novice VIII was sent\nthis year, but the 1st and\n2nd VIIIs travelled to\nReading to compete in\ntheir respective divisions.\nThe 1st VIII had rather\nan odd look about it as\nit has been rather injury\nprone so far this year.\nX COUNTRY\nConcerning Elephants\nThere are no elephants\nor hippopotami roaming\nwild in Surrey, though\nthere is certain i ly no lack\nof mud in which Ithey\nmight wallow as was\nfound by runners in the\nfourth league race at\nGuildford. I.C., with our\n18 runners, comprised no\nless than one-filth of the\nfield, drawn from twenty\nother colleges, which set\noff round 5J miles of\nknee-deep ploughed mud.\nThis large turnout, together With Rob Allinson's position of 8th, despite\nhaving a spiked foot, Steve\n(of whom more later)\nWebb's making Ithe first\nteam and the timely return to form of Ian Ellis\nled to the result that the\nfirst team is now third in\ndivision one (but only\nseven points ahead), and\neven the fourth team put\nin another appearance (at\nlast) so that we are now\n4th, ll th and 18it h in the\nsecond division with one\nrace to go.\n5 for the 5\nThe following Saturday,\nin a hastily arranged fix-ture, the \"Hiillingdon 5\",\nonly five Of our more Stalwart back markers took\npart, with Steve (again)\nWebb doing within experimental error of 30min, Dave Jones 30m48, Keith\nAhlers not far behind him,\nMike Welford looking extremely distressed after 'his\nsprint start in 32min and\nPete Johnson completing\nour performance in 35min. Hyde Park Relay\nTitle: \"How Birmingham led 86 other teams all\nthe way setting a new\nrecord of 84m07s, followed by Cambridge University in 84m30s and not\nso closely by Loughborough Colleges in 85m32s, how Jim Brown set a new\ncourse record of 13m21s taking Borough Road\nfrom eighth to fifth on the\nlast lap and winning for\nthem the Imperial College\nUnlion Cup, and how I.C. came 56th( despite Strained\nligaments, 'n' bouts of flu\nand sickly parents) to\nachieve which Ian Ellis,\nPaul Clark, Dave's Payne\nand Houlbrooke, Phil\nMeyler and Alf Gamett\ndid times of 15m53,15m55,16m40,17 m10,16m34 and 16m33 respective-ly. Also some remarks on\nhow Sir Brian and Lady\nFlowers kindly came along\nand presented the trophies\nand how Steve (yet again)\nWebb was unexpectedly\ncalled forth to present Ithe\nSteve Webb Trophy to\nCambridge. With a short\nrecord of how Rob spent\n2hrs looking for his coat\nand concluding with a note\nabout the manner of our\ndefeat later that evening at\nanother relay at the hands\nof Alsager who started\nwith half-empty glasses\nand how next morning I.C. became the alternative\nattraction to the Changing\nof the Guard (which\nwasn't on), how Trafalgar\nSquare was visited and\nhow Pad felt himself inwardly threatened during\na sprint down Pall Mall\".\nThat's it, except to\nthank everybody s' friends\nfor their help, Kaliray,\nNeil, Keith and Doug for\ntheir part in the affair (and\nRich Harrington, Ashely\nCooper, Geoff Spurr, Rob\nMaddison and Ian \"have\ngun will travel\" Isherwood). Also thanks ito the\nrefectory Staff for feeding\n600 people in Jhr, and\nsome Dramsoc people (cf.\nlast year).\nD.A. J. Perhaps it would be more\naccurate to say that the\nelite IV from the VIII\nhas been prone to injury.\nNeither Graham Lloyd\n(car crash and broken\nwrist) nor Dai Bevan\n(strained back) were able\nto row, whilst Bill Swift\n(Pitoraeasis Rosea?) and\nJohn Bland (flu plus ab-s ces s) just managed to get\nfit in time to occupy the\nstroke and four seats re-spec t iv ely. The absence of\nthe first two meant that\nJoe Shrypriuk T.C' s. answer to Dave Sawyer) had\nto change sides, which left\nroom for a guest appearance from Dick Smith\n(direct from Mount Kenya accompanied by Amoebic Dysentry) who last\nmade an appearance in\nthe U.L. Alum Cup where\nhe won the Novice sculls.\nThe first race against\nSouthampton University\nwas a typical I.C. opening\nrow, with half the crew\nthinking it was easy while\nthe other half were killing\nthemselves and wondering\nwhy they weren't going\naway. The result being an\nunconvincing win by 2L. The Semi-Final was\nagainst Reading University and I.C. drew the\nun favoured Oxon station.\nDue to a bend in the\ncourse, the start was staggered and this station had\n3/4L disadvantage on the\nstart. Off the start Reading pulled out another\n1/4 length and went almost clear. However the\nscratch I.C. boat suddenly clicked and with their\nseverely geared boat they\npowered their way through\nReading, rating about\n34. By half way I.C. had\na1/4L lead and as they\ncrossed, the finishing line\nthe lead was over a length.\nThis race was good by any\nstandards, but unfortunately it took a lot out of\nthe crew as they were very\ntired (to put it politely),\nand it was with some\ntrepidation that I.C. awaited the final against\nOriel (Oxford).\nNow Oriel was a load\nof cocky . . . , especially\nas they had won the event\nlast year. Having had a row over in their heat,\nthey had reached the start\nof their semi-final only to\nfind that their opposition\nhad broken their rudder.\nOn returning to the landing stage and seeing I.C. flaked out after their race\nagainst Reading, they decided that since they were\nobviously going to win\nanyway, there might as\nwell be a three way final\ninstead of them having to\nrow in a semi final. After\nputting this proposition to\nthe I.C. coach, they\npromptly got back in their\nboat and rowed off to the\nstart of their semi final.\nIn this race they lost some\nof their confidence as they\nwere pushed pretty hard\nby Pembroke. The final\nwas rowed in poor light\nas it was now about 5.30.\nThe race had two distinct\nphases. The first lasted\nabout ten strokes in which\ntime Oriel took about\n3/4L. The second lasted\nfor the rest of the race,\nand saw I.C. row through\nOriel to win by a good\n2 iL. Thus the first Regatta of 1974 brought success\nto the 1st VIII.\nThe 2nd VIII also managed to reach the final of\ntheir event and did well\nto get within 3/4L of\nReading II. With a little\nmore preparation this\nVIII could do well.\nThe weekend's racing\nwas not perhaps the best\npreparation for the following Wednesday which\nsaw the second event of\nthe year take place. This\nrace, the University of\nLondon Head of the River Race, is a processional\nrace in which the crews\nset off at 10 second intervals and are timed over a course of some 4 i miles, is\na vastly different sort of\nrace to the one of the previous weekend. I.C. have\nonly lost the open division\ntwice since 1962 and despite a bad row managed\nto win it again. Unfortunately, unlike last year,\nthey didn't manage to\nbeat Tyrian ( UL II), who\nrace but are not eligible\nfor the trophy, not being\na college crew. The 2nd VIII came sixth overall,\nand the first Novice VIII\nmanaged to come second\nin their division.\n\n"

Although early in the season Bill Galderwood had\nhad this title blaze ned on his golf bag and everyone\nhad assumed that this was the case, recent events had\nJed to the growing belief that 'there had come one\neven greater than he'. Who this was no-one knew but\nmany felt that perhaps unbeaten Chris Cobbledick\nfitted the bill. However the society Captain had made\nit known (often!) that, in his opinion, his own unbeaten run in the team entitled him to be thought of\nin the same breath as these two (unfortunately no-one\nelse agreed). John Mendonca, a recent addition to the\nteam ranks, had won all bis matches in such style\nthat some felt his unbeaten run was the significant\none and that the championship would show him up as\n'Golfer of the Society'. The society hon. sec, Jules\nDan, expressed the belief that the only true stamp oi\nstar golfing talent was to have an unbeaten record in\nthe first team; thus Bill was 'really only a second rate\nhacker with an impressive sticker on his bag'.\nHowever, no matter who it is that one considers\nas the greatest star one thing is certain; the society\nat IC is undoubtedly the most talented and successful\nin London today. For proof of this we have only to\nlook at the number of team members Who have played\nfor London University this season. These are Bill\nCalderwood, Nigel Foster, Rich Brown, Mike Strickland and at the time of writing John Mendonca has\njust been called up for his first cap. Considering our\nSociety is only permitted to be 25 strong this is a remarkable tribute to the wealth of talent at IC.\nIndeed when one puts by all this the fact that John\nMedonca is also a Portugese Youth International the\nthought must occur that there may be many stars\nwith us at present.\nIf the array of talent for the Championships was\nmind-boggling the scores were not. In almost perfect\nconditions the morning's play proved to be an almost\nunqualified disaster, the qualification being Andy\nKnox who cruised in with an ett72. This placed him\nin a Clear lead by five shots over Bill Calderwood at\nlunch which he celebrated with a couple of rustic\npints of ale. Everyone enjoyed Andy celebrating in this\nmanner, possibly because it removed the fear in every-one's mind that he might run away with the 'Tourney'\nin the afternoon. In the afternoon playing conditions\ngrew somewhat worse and paradoxically the scores\nimproved a little. Andy Knox let his grip on the\ntournament slip and Bill Calderwood stepped bravely\ninto the breach to take the coveted President's Trophy\nfor the best days medal score. Runner-up to him was\nour old onion-eater Clive Pembetton who played a solid if uninspired day's golf. Rick Brown won the\nGlover cup for the best gross of the day although he\nhit many more than a gross of shots. Runner-up was\nour international star John Medonca. The Lawson\ncup competition for the best stable ford round in the\nafternoon was taken by Jules Dan, an uncannily successful competitor in his own competitions.\nAlthough we seem to cut his handicap prior to\nevery club competition he still seems to produce the\nbest net t nonetheless. Runner-up to Jules was Mike\nMarx who played well enough to win most stable ford competitions if it were not for the aforementioned\nbeing in the field.\nIn conclusion I would say that the competition was\nan occasion enjoyed by everyone, particularly our\nnew Society Champion Bill Calderwood.\nNigel Foster\nHOCKEY\nWed., Feb. 20thI. C.1st XIv. LONDON HOSPITALS Semi-final of the University of London Knock-out\nCup.\n0-1 (Penalty)\nI.C. were knocked out\nof the Cup competition in\na hard, well-contested\nmatch. Although individual players on the I.C. side\ndisplayed a good work\nrate, the team in general\ncould not link-up to show\nthe form which had earlier disposed of Barts. The\nHospitals side seemed the\nmore alert of the teams\nand were slightly quicker\nto the \"loose balls\". However, I.C. were well able\nto cope with the pressure\nin defence but were unable to penetrate on a regular basis into the\nHospital's'D\\ The deciding goal came from a penalty flick given, as we ad-mit, quite fairly, for stick\nobstruction in the ' D'. The last efforts of I.C. could not prevail in spite\nof a tactical substitution\nin the 2nd half intended to\ncreate more drive in the\ncentre.\nTeam: Heffe r, Cameron, Hatcher, Whittington,\nBrown, Hanson, Ross,\nHarrison, Gahir, Woodhouse, Downs (capt.).\nSub. Puri. Umpire G. Popple.\nSat., 23rd Feb.\nI. C.1st XIv ASHFORD44 This was meant to be a \"friendly\" match against\na1 st division side, I.C. still unjustly lingering in\nthe 3rd division, hut due\nto very poor umpiring\nthe match degenerated into a well-disguised brawl\n20 mins. from the end.\nI.C. had until this period\nheld the lead but Ashford\nfought back using the\noccasional technical infringement which was un-penal is ed. Tempers became a little fr ought and\nfouling commenced on a widespread and very\nskilled basis. All fouls\nwere unseen and it was\nnoted well executed. Ashford did assume the lead\nlate in the match, but a well converted penalty by\nHarrison gave the final\nscore. (Mr. Kullar had not\nrecently shown brilliant\nform in the art of penalty\nflicks.) The general impression was one of a match which started out\nto be a little physical, but\nlater degenerated to a game in which skill was\nsacrificed.\nTeam: Bateman, Cameron, Vieyra, Downs\n(capt.), Hanson, Evans,\nRoss, Kullar, Puri, Harrison, Tyler.\nGoals: Evans (the half-back), Puri (2), Harrison.\nWed., 27th Feb.\nI. C.1st XIv. SILVERWING( BE A)12 Yet another hard match\nmarred by poor umpiring.\nThe game qui cl dy became\nphysically-orientated and\nI.C. ceased to play with\nany skill. A good goal by\nNicols gave I.C. the lead\nbut this was unfortunately\nlost. The match which\nwas poor was succeeded\nby an excellent bar night\nspent reminiscing about\nSwedish porn pens and\nthe hard lot of the airline\nstaff. Ross seemed to be\nover-infatuated with a topic of conversation\u2014\ntennis, or something. At least his tongue didn't quite scrape the floor.\nTeam: Heffer, Cameron, Hatcher, Evans, Brown, Hanson, Ross,\nPuri, Downs (capt), Nicols, Tyler.\nGoal: Nicols.\nM.D. D.2nd XI Last Saturday the all\nstar XI played away at\nAshford, Middlesex. Despite some rather confusing \"Popplogical\" travelling instructions we all\narrived in time for a3o 'clock bully off.\nThe pace of the game\nwas typical of most 2nd XI matches \u2014 fast and\nfurious. The enthusiasm\nis admirable but I feel a little more level-headed-ness and ball control\nwould pay better divi-d ends. The forwards were\nkept busy all through the\nmatch and Dave Crook\ncame close to scoring on\nnumerous occasions. The\ndefence showed more coordination than.has been\nevident in the past although the half backs\ncould have given the forwards more support when\non the attack. A special\nword of thanks to Graham Popple for sparing\nsome of his invaluable\ntime. He will be well received in the team next\nweek with or without\nspouse in attendance.\nResult: Ashford 0; I.C0. Team: N. Harrison, A. Winker, J. Huckle, D. Balderson, K. Rawlings,\nD. Price, J. Pepper, T. Feline, D. Crook, J.An drews, A. Brewster.\nSHOOTING\nOn Sunday, February\n24th the annual full-bore\nrifle match between RCS and Guilds was held at\nBisley under almost ideal\nweather conditions.\nBisley Camp, Brookwood, Surrey, is the\nworld's centre for full-bore shooting. The distances over which one can\nshoot vary from 100 to\n1200 yd s. Due to alterations at present being\nmade on the medium\nlength ranges the competition was, for the first\ntime, held at 900 and\n1000 yd s. As is customary, Guilds\nwere barely up to strength\nwhile RCS had a large\nand talented pool on\nWhich to draw. After\nleaving the Sports Centre\nat the ungodly hour of\n9.20 a.m. the teams\nreached Bisley, despite\nunintentional detours,\nRCS\nJohn Emerson (Capt.)\nSimon Hellyer\nGeoff Kolbe\nPaul Jorden\nC&G Colin Waldron (Capt.)\nDavid Styles\nDavid Lea\nVaughan Phillips\nearly enough for the mor-ning's shoot, over 90\u00a7\nyd s., to be finished by a1.00 p.m. deadline.\nDuring a mainly liquid\nlunch at the North London Rifle Club scores\nwere compared and RCS were found to have already accumulated a12 point lead.\nIn the afternoon, following some 'slight' delay in changing target\nmarkers, all shooting was\ncompleted well before the\nlight started to fail but\nnot before representatives from both sides had\nshown their lack of experience by failing several\ntimes to hit the target,\nwith the result that RCS romped home to a well\ndeserved victory.\nThe scores (best 4 from\neach team to count,\nmarked out of 50) were\nas follows:\n900 yd s1000yd s Total\n41 45 86\n43 39 82\n47 42 89\n46 38 84\nTeam total 341\n46 46 92\n38 39 77\n43 16 59\n38 43 81\nTeam total 309\nSteve Dawson, Mike Hall and Tony Porter were\nalso involved.\nJOHN EMERSON, SIMON HELL YER Photograph : Standing (left to right): S.M.

We started the games on the floor, which\nput us off, as the winks were bouncing too high. After\nthe first round, tables were available and so once again\nwe would reach the heights of brilliance and destroy\nall those in our way. Tony Bush made some good\nmoves but his vision was somewhat impaired by gin\nand tonic and a few s quo ps went astray. Potting out\nwas the order of the day again s lt vastly inferior opposition and the result was a grand victory.\nEarlier we had played Southampton in the Prince\nPhillip Wink competition and for once produced a full team. We fought bravely against the Leeds I hi ted\nof winks, but we are no Bristol City and it was to no\navail. Tony Bush did not play. Our agony in defeat was\nslightly alleviated by a win in the last round. Helen,\nhaving gone off to bash up amines man, left her partner to fend for himself. He borrowed a player front\nsomewhere and they won their game. Maybe we should\nhave got rid of her before the first game . . .\nWinks desperately needs someone to take over next\nyear.
