    "content": "Fischerspooner\n#1\nOut now on Ministry of Sound recordings\n\"Sounds good, looks good, feels good\".\nHowever much frontman Casey\nSpooner's statement of intent verges on\nunashamed hedonism, it's hard not to\ntake him completely seriously when he\nhollers his manifesto at the top of his\nlungs at the end of a typically firework-laden, art-fashion-sex-music Fischerspooner extravaganza. For this group of\nelectro-clash forerunners, everyone and\neverything is an understatement.\nSpooner (pic above) and his main\ncohort Warren Fischer must be feeling\necstatic with their efforts on this album.\nStorming right to the top of every\n\"kew lest\" record of the year chart in\n2001, the NYC duo have recently\nastounded peers by signing an unprecedented UK record deal with Ministry\nworth \u00a32million. Deep breathing, pumping bass, voc o dal submission, climaxing synthesis er gasps, throbbing electro beatz and a lump of hump in' existentialism. Not an\narray of overheard noise in the darkest\ncorners Mech Eng, but a neat, succinct\ndescription of the opening track Invisible.\nOther musical highlights include the perverted yet sterilised cover of Wire's The\n15th, the sombre looming pitch bend affair Tone Poem, and of course the s le azif i ed poly sexual head rush that is their\nsignature dance anthem Emerge.\nFischerspooner are the Chinese burn\nupon climax, they are heavy eyes rolling\nin glass as their mascara streaks under\nhot lights. They are that scary looking\nlatex body paint. They are fer v our and\nmystery, arrogance and modesty. This\nalbum is called #1 for a reason.\nBBBB B Chris\nHundred Reasons\nIdeas Above Our Station\nOut this Monday on Columbia records\nHundred Reasons, the new hope for\nBritish rock, are rough, and I'm not talking about their looks. This album shows\na lot of promise, but at the moment their\nmusic is still very rough around the\nedges.\nThe main criticism I have is that too\nmany of the songs sound the same. As you go through the album, you keep\nthinking that you're hearing one of the\nsingles (and as there have only been two,\nthis should show you what I mean). This\nis not to say that there's no variation; it's just that there are certain riffs that\nalways seem to repeat.\nThe best tracks on the album are I 'll\nFind You, Oratorio and particularly\nAvalanche. These show how Hundred\nReasons can rock, build songs up and\nalso do the quiet, gentle melodic things\nwell.\nAvalanche is that little bit different to\nthe rest, showing off the talent that is\nthere, and although it is quite gentle, it\nacts as a good \"calm-down\" for the\nalbum after the \"get up and rock\" characteristics of most of the songs.\nWe must hope that Hundred Reasons\nbecome more smooth and refined with\npractice. But, all in all, Ideas Above Our\nStation is a promising debut, and the\nband deserve most of the hype that is\ncoming their way.\nBBBB O Tank\nmusic reviews\nThe Bellrays\nMeet The Bellrays\nOut now on Poptones\nFrom the unreconstructed rock intro on\nthe first track Too Many Houses In Here,\nThe Bellrays make it loud and clear\nwhere they're coming from. There's no\nattempt to be clever, no pretence of representing any new scene. Listening to\nthe Bellrays, you wonder if they've ever\nheard any music since The Eagles and\nLed Zeppelin. Except maybe\nWhitesnake. This is rock. And it's loud.\nThe production gives everything a late\nseventies pre-metal flavour, in the same\nway that Give Out But Don't Give Up\nalmost sounded like it had been recorded\nin the deep South in the sixties (in other\nwords, it sounds \"authentic\"). This is\nheavy metal as it began, before it\nbecame fully fledged as Iron Maiden or\nGuns 'n' Roses. Not a trace of nu-metal,\nhip-hop, cyber, industrial or any other\ngenre that has been sporadically incorporated into the gimmicky metal scene.\nSo, what's the point of this? Musically,\nthere's not one new idea on this album.\nLyrically, the themes are as dubiously\nsimilar as ever: \"If I knew that this was a dream, I could die tomorrow\". Please,\nspare us. But, as with all rock, the point\nis that it rocks. The blues, funk and early\nsoul influences are there, with the gui-tars, the drums, and the half-screamed,\nhalf-croaked vocals. And the spirit of\nraw k, baby. Pass the JD.\nS B8BB Robert\nThose with a sharp eye will have noticed a slight decrease in the size of the music\nsection recently, due to a horrible combination of maths exams and cost-cutting\nmeasures. So when I finish exams, I 'll do some more work, and maybe Will will give\nme some more space. Yes. Dave\nThe winner of the David Holmes album (Issue 1233) is Jenny Rieger of Biology I. "

    "content": "reviews film\nEditorial\n\"new Spider-Man movie\"\nYou're stressed. You have exams next week. But your pen and\npaper are long lost brothers. They've gone AWOL. You prefer it\nthat way. So why not go down to the local cinema and watch a movie?\nThat's what I was thinking a couple of days ago. Sitting at\nhome thinking, this revision isn't going to get me anywhere (in\nthe short term). So I call up the Odeon ticket-line. They list their\nmovies. I hang up. Unimpressed. I would prefer to hole-punch a loose pieces of paper than to watch the Scorpion King. I would\nrather scribble in the margin than to see Hugh Grant faff ing around in About A Boy. I would rather draw-up an ingenious\nand yet impossible revision timetable than to see De Niro sell\nhimself out again in Showtime. So I went to see The Count Of\nMonte Cristo which was good. Sword fights and stuff.\nBut there are movies to look forward to after the exams. For\ninstance, Spider-Man is being released nationwide on the 14th June. The comic book story of Peter Parker, the geek who got\nbitten by a radioactive spider and gained supernatural (mainly\nclimbing) powers, will be hitting the big screens at last.\nAfter being turned down by James Cameron and David\nFincher, Sam Raimi, director of the legendary Evil Dead series,\ntook the Spider-Man reins and has made an action movie which\nhas been received well in the US by critics and audiences. This\nshould be fantastic film with a \u00a3100m budget spent mainly on\nspecial effects which push the boundaries of movie tech. So something to look forward to in the summer when you're\nShooters\nreleased 29th April on DVD\nBased in Liverpool, Shooters, directed by Dan Reed is a British\ngangster film in the vein of classic gritty British films like Get\nCarter or Scum.\nAnybody who's ever had dealings with club bouncers will\nunderstand the main characters Big John (John Wayland) and\nDezzy (Dezzy Baylis), who decide to take time-off looking for\ntrainers to make some quick money robbing a drug dealer's home.\nAs you might expect it all goes horribly wrong and they end\nup shooting the dealer. What's worse is the drug boss comes\nlooking for the money and notices Big John driving round in a new convertible, a purchase which slightly incriminates him.\nThe real highlight of the film is the fact that all the main characters are played by people the director met on location in\nLiverpool which gives the film a real feel of being true to life a la Ken Loach.\nThe strong link between drugs and crime is explored in a persuasive way without being over the top or sensational. A lot of\ntime is spent in developing the characters as dreamers who\nain't too clever but are desperate to prove to others that they\naren't lost in a dead end job. The friendship between the men is\nalso explored, though you are left to decide for yourself whether\nit remains intact by the end. Despite being a typical s couse hard man, Big John's relationship with his ex-wife and daughter\ngives his character a bit more sympathy, which I found a refreshing touch.\nAll in all it's a fairly good film memorable only for the unusual\n(and successful) casting decision and the character is ation. It is\nin a similar to the Lock, Stocks and Gangster No.Is of this\nworld, but different enough to be worth a look. You won't get\nany of the Guy Ritchie snappy dialogue, but instead there's a bleak and gritty urban realism.\nI was lucky enough to meet the directors and cast at a special\nshowing in a small cinema in Soho (oh, the benefits of working\nfor Felix, lu wy!) and was given a free DVD which will be up for\ngrabs in one of our competitions.\nDave Hinselwood\nnot watching the World Cup or relaxing in the sun. DafJUS\nFelix On Film Shooters Competition\nThis is you chance to win Shooters on DVD. It is one of the\nbest British Gangster movies ever made and essential for any\ngangster movie fan or wannabe. Now just calm down for a second I haven't even given you the question.\nYou can win the recently released DVD by answering this\nquestion. Faster finger first: Who stars as Jack Carter in the\nyear 2000 version of Get Carter?\na) Al Pacino b) Gary Busey c) Sylvester Stallone\nAnswers to film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nImperial athletes helped the\nUniversity of London\nAthletics Club in a successful bank holiday weekend at\nthe Bedford International\nAthletics Stadium. Despite\nonly 4 Imperial athletes\nbeing able to compete due to\nexams (such as Scottish\nIndoor Pentathlon Champion\nJames Lowery), they certainly made their presence felt in\nthe team. Katherine Williams\nput in a gutsy run in the\nheats of the 400m to qualify\nfor the semi-finals. Captain\nSimon Lewis and Derek Mak,\nwith GB International\nDecathlete John Heanley\n(Holloway) and last years\nBUS AH OmH Champion Richard Sear (KCL) managed\nto help the 4 x100m Relay\nTeam qualify for the final.\nWith John, being replaced by\nGuido Guizzardi in the final,\nwho has a10.5s personal\nbest, there were high hopes\nof them cutting at least a second off there qualifying\ntime of 45.1s. However, in the\nfinal, an unfortunate mix up\nbetween Guido and Derek\nmeant the baton was not\nchanged in time and the\nteam was disqualified.\nA superb sprint double from\nEmily Freeman (UCL) was the highlight of the weekend.\nHer wins in the 100m and\n200m maintain University of\nLondon's record of having a BUS A champion in the last 4\ncompetitions (2 indoor and 2\noutdoors).\nFrom the word go Emily was\nimpressive, winning her heat\nand semi-finals in impressive\ntime whilst easing down at\nthe finish. Having been beaten in the 60m at the indoor\nchampionships earlier on in\nthe season by a100 th of a second, Emily was intent on\nbeating Kelly Thomas of\nLoughborough. Whilst Emily\nOutdoor\nwas easing through her\nheats, Kelly had to work hard\nto run similar times. In the\nfinal, both women were\ndrawn in the 2 middle lanes,\nand despite being very nervous before the start, Emily\nmanage to romp home in 1st place in a time of 11.79s, leaving Kelly 2nd in 11.96s. The win in the 100m seemed\nto set her up for her better\nevent, the 200m. With runs of\n24.01s and 24.03s in the\nheats, it seemed Susan\nWilliam's hand timed\nChampionship Record of\n23.8s was under threat. The\nmost notable fact of all was\nthe way she stormed away in\nher semi-final to win over a second ahead of arch rival\nKelly Thomas. Drawn in lane\n4 in the final, Emily won by\nover seven tenths of a second\nin 24.14s. Only head win of\n1.3m/s prevented her from\ntaking the record.\nOther noticeable performances of the weekend were from\nGordon Irvine (SGHMS),\nAndrew Hennessy (UCL),\nRichard Sear and John\nHeanley. Gordon Irvine had a solid run in the 10K final to\nfinish 12th. Former\nSportsman of the Year,\nAndrew Hennessy tried desperately to win the title in\nthe 3000m steeplechase that\nhas eluded him. If medals\nwere awarded for guts and\nbravery, this man would have\nthem all. After strolling\nthrough qualification in 4th place, in a time of 9mins34.9 sees (a minute slower than\nhis personal best), Andy looked set to dominate the\nfinal. However, due to studying for his finals of his medical degree he has had to cut\ndown training from 7 to 3\ntimes a weeks. This lack of\nfitness showed in the final.\nWith 4 laps to go, Andy took\nAthletics\nthe race by the horns and\ntook the lead. By the final lap\nhe had opened up a10m lead, but with250 m to go he\nwas struggling and 2\nLoughborough athletes overtook and finished in front of\nhim. Andy looked shattered\nat the end of the race and\npromptly threw up. If the\nrace was last year he would\nhave easily won it, but its\nseems it came a year too late.\nIn the 110m Hurdles, defending champion Richard Sear\nwas unfortunate not to win it\nagain this year. After twisting his ankle whilst dipping\nfor the line in the 1st round of\nthe 100m, there was a fear\nthat he could be out for the\nhurdles. However, with a bit\nof ph y sio, strapping and\nibuprofen, Richard was able\nto qualify and line up for the\nfinal. Unluckily, Richard\nstarted terribly in the final\nand only finished 4th in a time of 14.9s behind 3 other\nrunners who all ran 14.5s. GB International decathlete\nand former BUS A indoor long\njump champion John\nHeanley qualified for both\nthe High Jump and Long Jump final, but due to exam\ncommitments, was unable to\ncompete in those finals losing valuable team points.\nOverall, with key athletes\nmissing, University of\nLondon performed well at\nthe championships considering we do not have the\nresources as the likes of\nLoughborough, Bath, Brunei\nand UWIC. Hopefully we can\ncontinue our championship\nsuccessful in the future.\nDerek Mak\nSub-Warden Positions At\nBeit Hall\nA number of sub-warden positions will be available\nfrom the start of September 2002 in Beit Hall.

Indeed your correspondent need only have taken a journey through the streets\nand alleyways near college to\nhear dozens of of such tales of\nArab oppression from the\nmany who have fled to the\nsafety of this country. The\nBritish media joins in the distortion of truth and the channelling of hatred towards\nIsrael. Just consider the\namount of attention given to\nthe 2.7 million Palestinian\nArabs, ignoring the news of\nwhat is going on in the many\nArab states whether in Sudan\nor Algeria or Syria and Lebanon. Does the media\ndecry the Syrian subjugation\nand occupation of Lebanon?\nA pet topic of the British\nmedia is the plight of\nPalestinian Arab refugees,\nignoring the responsibility of\nArafat and other Arab rulers\nfor that plight. Jenin, supposedly a refugee \"camp\" was a fortress rich in weapons and\nexplosives, yet they say that\nthey do not have enough\nmoney for food, while the\nBritish taxpayer still continues\nto finance the UN emergency\nrefugee agency (an emergency\nthat has lasted for 54 years\nwhen 5 Arab states first\ninvaded Israel).\nAll of Israel is a refugee\ncamp- indeed half the population are survivors of the\nHolocaust. What is not\nrealised is that the other half\nare former citizens of Arab\ntalk back\nstates. These Jewish refugees\nlost everything in their ancestral homelands and their\nancient communities dating\nback to biblical times were\neliminated in 1948. But the\nIsraelis, all of them refugees,\nconcentrated on building new\nlives in Israel and developing\ntheir country. The Palestinian\nArabs have been encouraged\nby their rulers and elements\nwithin the European Union to\nact as a ticking time bomb\nwhich threatens to be a serious hazard to world peace.\nPerhaps your correspondent,\ncould have volunteered his\nservices as a \"human shield\" to\nstand outside any Israeli nursery school or cafe or Pool Hall\nto guard against such homicide bombers - somehow\nthough I doubt it!\nDavid Shalom\nChairman Imperial College\nJewish Society\nOn bank holiday Monday,\nImperial College Jewish\nSociety, along with around\n55,000 other supporters from\ndifferent faiths and back-grounds, attended the \"Israel\nSolidarity Rally\" at Trafalgar\nSquare.\nThe rally was held under the\nbanner of \"Yes to Peace & No\nto Terror\" and was intended as\na massive show of support to\nthe Israeli people who are having to endure relentless, indiscriminate and brutal terrorist\nattacks over the past 19\nmonths.

    "content": "talk random\nAdamant To The Fish\nThe Bizarre Absurdities of Normalcy.\nSo, after minutes of hard work I have\nstolen some valuable print space for my\nown brand of cynical and irritating banter.\nI can tell you many things, many things\nindeed. I could tell you that January the\n27th was not a good day, but that we don't talk about it, I could tell you strange and\nimagined things about strange and imagined things and trust me, one day I will.\nFor now, however, I will restrict myself to\nreality, or rather my perception of reality,\nwhich is often a very different matter.\nAfter that brief and totally pointless\nintroduction I will divert my attention to\nmatters at hand, or rather at foot, for you\nsee I have chosen shoes for the topic of my\ndiscussion given my recent frustration in\nattempting to purchase such garments.\nShoes apparently have been standardised\nto fit the average man (and presumably\nwoman, though I made no research into\nthis area for obvious reasons). I was\nearnestly told by the manager of a large\nsports shop in this fair city that size\nranges have been cut on both ends of the\nscale, as there is simply no demand for\nanything outside the range 7-10. I felt it\nnecessary to correct his inadequate statement as clearly I had demand for such\nshoes, being as I was in a shoe shop,\ndemanding them. At this point all helpfulness disappeared from his demean our and\nI felt obliged to depart. No less than ten\nother shops brought the same disappointment although all the fire had slipped out\nof me by this point and I was no longer\ncapable of wittily putting down salesmen,\njust blindly and quietly accepting their\nrebukes.\nThis tale of woe is not designed to make\nyou pour sympathy and tears on the ink of\nthis page but rather to highlight a disturbing trend in our lives. Everything is standardised from footwear to television programmes and frankly it scares me. The old\nadage \"familiarity breeds contempt\"\nsprings gaily to mind. By shop number\nseven I was finding what could have been\na diverting experience about as featureless and bland as a relief map of Holland\nand how much more contemptuous can\nyou get than devoting more than five hundred words complaining about it. Soon, I feel, we will all have to normal is e ourselves to fit into jobs, colleges, marriages\nand even bus seats. Some of you may slot\nneatly into this mould where others like\nme will have to do a lot more squeezing\nthan should be necessary. Those wonderfully interesting soap operas, those deep\nintriguing documentaries, those original\nand realistic police dramas and even\nthose simply indescribable make-over\nshows will all blend into twenty-four\nhours a week of un stimulating, incomprehensible grey presented by identical presenters from Newcastle. Your minds will\nbe an aes thetis ed by the hypnotic repetition in all walks of life until you will have\nonly the vaguest recollection of what real\nlife was like, all those years ago when\nthere was colour in your existence, when\nyou didn't have to bind your feet or even\ncomb your hair. Sorry, I'm getting carried\naway. It is all very noble of me to take a stand I think, especially since I 've still got\nwet feet.\nThey're playing our song\nat the Union.\nThursday, May 23\n8pm: FREE@The Union\ndbs bar open from 8pm imperial\n\u2022 college\n\n"

    "content": "short story\nWith exams and everything that happens around this time of\nyear there are no book reviews at the moment. What follows\nthough is an excellent short story by author Robert Bell. I 've\nbeen reading Rob's work for a while now and I believe that it's in the same league as many of the published authors we see\ntoday. Hopefully in a few years we'll be seeing his name on the\nbookshelves.\nGive A Dog A Bone by Robert Bell\nI hate that damn dog. If I were to be granted one wish, at this\nsecond, I'd have it skinned alive and set alight. But I'm sure,\nDear Reader, if you had to see the dog in question - Speedy is its\nname - you'd love it to bits. My wife did. Anyway, let me start at\nthe beginning.\nOn our first anniversary, I waited for my wife, Deborah, in the\nlounge of our new home, holding an expensive ring in one hand\nand a bouquet of flowers in the other, anxious to give her the\npresent and then receive something of similar value. Instead,\nshe walked inside holding Speedy in her arms. Speedy, a golden retriever, had a smooth coat and soft eyes, enough to drive\nanimal lovers mad.\n\"Ahh, isn't he just adorable, Henry?\" she said. I sat without\nshowing any emotion, hoping she had bought this animal for\nthe both of us to keep around the house, not as an anniversary\ngift.\n\"Happy anniversary!\" she said, handing the mutt to me. I felt\nlike smashing my fist through her face. I took the dog, though,\nand held it as you would any animal, with my hands underneath\nits stomach. That's when it pissed on me. Now, I'm a patient\nman - especially when it comes to pay back and I know the\nimportance of the right time and right place; I smiled, put it\ndown, and told Deborah that it needed house training before it\ncould be allowed back into the house. I would do the training\nmyself, I told her. Soon, Speedy would earn its name.\nThe day I decided to train Speedy was clear and wind less, the\nsun mild and pleasant, and I told my wife I was taking it across\nthe road. Let me explain: houses line our side of the road, but on\nthe other side is the end of a farm, which stretches for a good\nhalf mile. In some parts the field is packed with short, fat thorn\ntrees and knee-length grass; but elsewhere, such as the area\nopposite our house, the grass is shorter, the trees sparser. The\nvegetation increased further into the land, though, obscuring\nthe road from view.\nThe initial training was successful, and Speedy soon learned\nwhat to do and what not do to. It's amazing how much difference a swift kick to the stomach makes. After the training, I took Speedy home; it followed a while behind me, and not\nalongside me as it had done earlier. By the time I returned,\nDeborah had already left for her weekly game of tennis, so I left\nSpeedy in the front yard and went to do some gardening work\nin the back. I stopped working at five in the afternoon and\nwalked around the house, admiring my hard work as I went\nalong. That when I saw what it had done.\nThe little mutt had dug about ten holes in my garden - the\nsame garden, I might add, which had twice won 'garden of the\nyear1. Not thinking straight, I picked up a large spanner and\nwent to look for the animal. With the weapon in my right hand,\nI called and whistled to it, hoping it would come towards me\nwith its tail wagging and its head bobbing up and down. It was\nnowhere to be found.\nI searched the garden and house for two hours, in which time\nmy anger did not dissipate: I felt it grow inside me as a seed\nwould've in my once-fertile garden. Then, about to give up, I walked to the field, just in case the mongrel had slipped\nthrough the gate. Sure enough, I found it there. Wagging its tail\nand bowing its head in submission, it approached me and\nlicked my feet. I looked around, and, seeing that none of the\nneighbours were watching, brought the spanner down on its\nback as hard as I could. Speedy yelped. So I gave it another.\nThen one more, just for good measure. The dog stayed at my\nfeet and continued licking my toes, whimpering and whining\nsoftly.\nNow it was time to cover up. I loaded Speedy into the backseat of my car and drove it to the vet. Once there, I played the\npart of the concerned dog owner whose dog had been run over\nby a car. The vet emerged after half an hour and told me Speedy\nwould lose the use of its hind legs. Not to worry, he said, for he\nwould fit a brace to Speedy's legs, with four wheels on the bot-tom. The brace would support the dog's weight, and the wheels\nwould act as new hind legs, he told me.\nDeborah was not pleased when I returned home. She wanted\nto know why Speedy had been roaming the streets, if I had written down the number of the person who had run over him, and\nif Speedy had yelped a lot. I answered all the questions in my\npracticed routine, and she stopped harassing me and sat alongside Speedy. The mutt, of course, was now inside the house -and would have to stay indoors for a few days.\nThose days passed without any conflict. I think Speedy realized who the boss was, and it averted its gaze to the floor\nwhenever I walked past. On a few occasions, I felt like kicking\nits legs, just to test them out and see if it had recovered enough\nto go outside; but Deborah always managed to be in a nearby\nroom.\nAnd it was in those days, the time it spent indoors, that my\nwife came to love Speedy. She spent more and more time with\nit, buying hundreds of small, useless items that no dog could\never use, brushing its hair five times a day, and taking photos of\nit from every conceivable angle. Eventually, after endless arguments, Speedy was shifted outside again (she had bought it a kennel, of course). That's when it developed its love of rain. I tell\nyou, just the slightest drizzle would lure that dog out of his ken-nel, and it would run in circles, its front legs working overtime,\npulling those damn wheels behind it.\nI'd just fallen asleep - something I'd not done for weeks - when\nI heard it for the first time. It was a sharp, piercing sound that\ndipped in volume then grew louder. EE KAJ EEK... EEK AJEEK...EEKAJEEK I sat up in bed and gazed straight ahead at\nthe wall, convinced that a few teenagers were fooling around\noutside our window. But a quick peek through the curtain\nproved me wrong: Speedy's wheels had rusted. Months and\nmonths of frolicking in the rain had taken its toll.\nAnd so, for the next few weeks, as I plotted my wife's murder,\nSpeedy awoke me every night at around midnight. Let me stop\nright here: I have not mentioned the plan to kill my wife, as it is\nsomething I am not proud of. I would never have considered it\n\n"

    "content": "story short\nunder normal circumstances, but because my business was on\nthe brink of bankruptcy, and I am a proud man, I was forced to\nuse Deborah, or rather her Me insurance, as a means to an end,\nexcuse the pun.\nI will not go into the details of how I planned to kill her, but I will say that the two weeks preceding the murder were the\nlongest and hardest I have ever had to endure. And in that time,\nI came to hate the dog. I hated the sight of it, but more so the\nsound of it.\nI hated the way it hung around my wife like an irritating fly,\nfollowing her every move; when Deborah left for her Saturday\ntennis match, Speedy stood by the gate for hours, waiting for\nher to return. But the worst had to be the holes it dug around\nmy precious garden - I counted up to twenty holes in one day,\nall of them in the middle of the garden, where it was impossible\nto repair without causing further damage. Thinking back, I wish I had hammered the dog's front legs, not the hind legs. That\nway, it wouldn't have dug those damn holes. The time had\ncome. As I 've said, I won't go into any details; what follows is a brief description of the act.\nI awoke Deborah early that Sunday morning. I didn't make her\na special breakfast, although I had thought\nof it, but gently touched her white, freckled\nshoulder at around six in the morning. She\nstirred, looked at the time, and frowned at\nme.\n\"I thought we'd start with those walks we\ntalked about,\" I said, getting out of bed and\nslipping on my pants. She took longer than\nnormal to get dressed that day, but I didn't hassle her, and by the time she emerged\nfrom the house, I had mentally rehearsed the\nkilling a hundred times. At this point I must\nadd something: the previous night, I had\nwalked to the field and picked out a sturdy\nbranch, which I planned to use as a murder weapon, and then\nsearched for the spot with the most trees and bushes, a place\nhidden from the nearby road. I had left the branch at that spot.\nAnyway, we walked at a slow pace through the field, as\nDeborah made a habit of stopping at every second flower, bending down, and smelling it. Then she would straighten up and\ncontinue forward with her hands folded behind her back and a smile on her face. By this time, my heart thudded in my ribcage,\nand the last thing I wanted to hear - the worst possible sound -was the awful EEKAJEEK.. .EEKAJEEK.. .EEKAJEEK of Speedy.\nIt had slipped through the gate and followed my wife. She\nsmiled at it, called its name, then patted and kissed and stroked\nit for a few minutes. Before long, I spotted the stick on the\nground.\nI glanced over my shoulder, made sure that no inquisitive\npassers-by were watching us, then bent down and pretended\nto do my laces. Deborah stopped alongside me and put her\nhand on my shoulder. I think she remarked that the walk was a splendid idea, that it should be a weekly thing, but I can't be\nsure - the sound of blood rushing through my ears drowned out\nher voice. Then it was over. I don't remember much besides\nSpeedy barking and charging at me until I took a few swipes at\nhim. One image I do remember - one I 'll carry to my grave - is of\nmy wife lying face down on the ground, surrounded by a dusty,\ndark pool of her own blood. And her hair, I remember seeing\npieces of...well, pieces of her scalp entangled in her blood-soaked hair.\nWhen it was all over, I searched the area for Speedy, but it\nwas nowhere to be found. After half an hour, I gave up and\nwalked to the hole I had dug the night before.\nI buried the murder weapon. As I covered the hole, I noticed\nthat both ends of the stick were bloodied; I'd gripped the stick\nso tightly that the small knots on the wood had dug into my\npalm. I made sure my injured right hand did not touch my\nclothes, and walked home.\nI left my wife in the field. You see, I figured I'd play the part of\nthe concerned husband whose wife had been brutally beaten to\ndeath across the road from their house. No one would ever think\nit was me.\nThat night I waited for Speedy to come home, but by early the\nnext morning it had not returned, so I went to sleep for a few\nhours. I was awoken by someone knocking on the door. I got out\nof bed, rubbed my eyes with my left knuckle (my right hand\nbeat to its own pulse), and made my way to the door.\nIt was the police. There were about ten\npolice vehicles parked outside our house and\nacross the road, and a small crowd of people\nhad gathered nearby, some of them shaking\ntheir heads and pointing at me, others covering their mouths with their hands.\nWhat followed was nothing short of brilliance on my part: the policeman explained\nwhat I already knew, then I broke down and\ncried. He believed me, I'm sure of that, but\nasked me to accompany him to the spot\nwhere my wife had been killed. They had\nalready taken her body away, of course, but\nhe wanted me to show him the route that my\nwife walked through the field. I agreed and followed him to the\nfield. As we approached the spot, I had to remind myself not to\nbe cocky, as I felt a sudden surge of confidence, brought on by\nmy earlier play-acting. I stopped at the spot Deborah had been\nthe night before and pointed the police in the opposite direction\nof the stick.\nI knew I had them wrapped around my finger. I knew this\nwould be the last thing I had to pull off before I could sit back\nand receive the insurance money. And so I brought an end to\nthe proceedings, informing the officer that I could no longer\nbear to be around the area. He nodded and said I could leave. I sighed and turned around, keeping my eyes on the ground.\nWith each step I took, I mentally counted down the number of\nfeet to my house.\nTwenty...I walked, head bowed, tears flowing.\nFifteen...I could see the house now, and the voices of the\npolicemen were muffled.\nTen - EEKAJEEK.. .EEKAJEEK.. .EEKAJEEK.\nI stopped and turned, thinking that I had imagined that awful\nsound. But I was wrong: it was Speedy alright, and as he\nemerged from the bushes and shrubs, my heart sank. The murder weapon was in his mouth.\nSpeedy had been digging those damn holes again.\n\"Thinking back, I wish I had hammered the dog's front legs, not the\nhind legs. That way,\nit wouldn't have\ndug those damn\nholes.\"\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nLondon University Judo\nI.C.: Christopher Chang, Mark Cox( silver) Daniel\nForsdyke, Daniel Harvey,\nJulie Morgan, Scott Prosser,\nJames Walker (silver),\nOther Colleges: Sadia Ndako\n(bronze), Neil Moodi,\nFor many years, members of\nthe Imperial Judo Club have\nbeen fighting along side students from other London\nColleges in what constitutes\nthe University of London\nUnion judo team. And for\nmany years we have been\nprivileged to reap the titles\nand awards that have come\nfrom this fruitful partnership.\nTwo years ago at the BUS A championships saw London\ntaking the gold in the team\ntitle and last year we secured\nthe bronze. This year was no\nexception as it proved lucrative in the individual titles.\nBut first I must here give\nmention and thanks to Mr.\nJoe Dougherty a widely respected world champion\nwho selflessly devotes his\ntime to training and to Sadia\nNdako who captained the\nteam and organised the trip.\nThe competition took place\nat the National Arena in Birmingham over two days\non the weekend before the\nEaster Holiday. On the\nSaturday the Individual\nchampionships were run and\nit was here that the medals\nwere attained. There was a spread of weights across the\ncategories as team members\nstarved themselves, sau teed in the sauna and even stood\non their heads to make the\nweight. (More on this later).\nIn the Under 81kg Men's, Mark Cox, a renaissance man\nof sorts, took the silver. More\nat home on the Rugby pitch,\nin two years Cox moved from\nnovice to a level where he\ntook the second highest\naccolade in his field. In the\nOPEN(+100 kg) category,\nJames Walker, recently honoured with colours for his\nperformance on last year's team, took silver as well. Sadia Ndako who is a mere\nten points from her black belt\nwas awarded bronze in the\nwomen's category. Daniel\nHarvey takes the medal for\nmost stamina while Scott\nProsser the IC captain with\nfull colours fought admirably\ntaking some wins during the\nday. In an upset, Julie\nMorgan was denied a chance\nat medal ling, as she was the\nonly one in her lightweight\ndivision. Unintentionally or\notherwise, she drew blood\nfrom the higher graded opponent she eventually fought.\nLiterally.\nIn the team event on the\nsecond day we advanced\nseveral rounds before being\ndefeated just outside the\nmedal rounds. Of note was Christopher Chang's indomitable style of fighting\nwhereby he lures his opponent with outstretched arms\nreminiscent of Boris Karloffs\nFrankenstein! It was both\nhighly entertaining and effective as victory was swift\nand decisive! But the biggest\nlaugh of the weekend came\nfrom Mark Cox, who, 1 kg overweight and holding up\nthe proceedings, took the\nadvice that he should stand\non his head to shed the\nexcess. So, wearing only a smile, he assumed the position for 1 minute before jumping immediately on to the\nscales. It worked. I believe\nthat is one for the physicists\nto solve.\nBut by far the greatest\nspectacle occurred when British Olympian medallist\nKate Howey took to the mat.\nA rewarding experience\nwhich her hapless opponents\nor we shall never forget.\nIn drawing to a close there\nare just a few points I would\nlike to pull on in order to\nencapsulate one of this writers own opinions. In recent\ntimes there have been moves\nby the administration to \"re-brand\" or \"re market\" the\nimage of The College following dropping application levels and the like. But I propose\nthat the image needs first to\nbe defined and marketed to\nthose here now. That the college is and is seen to be a top\nclass institution is without\ndoubt. Just cast a glance at\nthe departmental academic\nratings. But this body is only\nskeletal. Time and time again\nin popularity ratings (as in\nthe results released last\nweek) or social ratings we fall continually short. And it\nis this that makes us un at tractive. What the College\nneeds is to be filled out with the meat of a culture. A fat\nbody of tradition fed by the\nachievement of clubs and societies and the experiences and ceremonies their\nmembers hold dear. How many know of the Colours\nawards for instance? More\nadvertising. Imagine the\ncrowds that would go to see\nthe movie Kate Howey vs.\nFrankenstein. And do not for-get, where it took Newton\nyears over at Cambridge to\nformulate his Principae, our\nown Cox'y boy broke 'em in one minute.

    "content": "this week\nEditorial\nHey there kiddies! How's you\nall doin'? I'm having a small\nnervous breakdown in the corner over here, due to the revelation that I'm even more dis-organised, and perhaps\nunlucky, than I had ever\ndreamed possible.\nLiterally minutes after sending off my editorial to the\nprinters last week, I received\nsome more fascinating news,\nand while it is still pertinent,\nit is no longer causing me\nquite the trauma it was, so I won't bother ranting about it.\nHowever, at that point I made\nthe fatal error of assuming\nthat things couldn't, physical-ly, become any worse.\nHow foolish to overlook that\nwhich can cause the most\npain. Affairs of the heart are\nall well and good, if you've got\nthe time, but I have just today\nbeen introduced to a far worse\nand more deadly strain of\nstress. Or stress of strain, per-hap s.I'm going to Holland next\nweek, which I must agree will\nprobably turn out to be a very\npleasant experience, but this\ndoes mean I have two issues\nof Felix to create by next\nMonday. This wouldn't be so\nbad were it not for the added\nbonus of the Alternative\nProspectus, which I have\nrecently been informed is 'Top\nPriority'.\nNow I'm slightly miffed\nabout this, because it wasn't actually meant to be my job,\nbut here I am lumbered with it\nanyway, since some muppet\n(you know who you are)\ndecided he couldn't be arse d to get on and do it himself.\nOkay, so he's got a degree to\ndo, or some equally dull\nexcuse, but I'm allowed to get\ngrumpy occasionally, eh?\nSo there's that, not to mention the fact that I have to\nhave the budgeting and 'gen-era l plan' for the next handbook sorted out in the next\ntwo weeks as well (remember\nI'm not here next week), so all\nin all I have a lot to do in the\nnext seven days.\nAnd then I'm going to go\nand represent the Union in\nDelft, Holland, and hopefully\n(when I'm not representing)\ntake some serious R&R, and I know you know what that\nmeans.\nSo that's the good news,\nand as such it has also given\nme something to write about\nin my editorial, which is\nalways a bonus.\nAnd who knows, if I insist\non looking on the bright side,\nwhich seems to be my only\nalternative to an aneurysm,\nthen I could see this as a valuable learning experience that\nwill enable me to manage\nstress in a positive and constructive way. Or I could just\ngo down the boozer and get\ncompletely troll i ed, which\nwould seem to be a far more\nattractive prospect, all things\nconsidered.\nAnd just in case you were\ninterested, which I know\nyou're not, but I still have\nspace to fill, so here it is, I have now been entirely drug\nfree for a week. That includes\nalcohol, nicotine, caffeine, and\nall illegal drugs, but not, I'm afraid I have to admit, choco-late. By the time you read this,\nhowever, I will have probably\nresumed my alcoholic ways,\nand will be in the bar trying to\nforget that I have done none of\nthe things that I intended to\ndo before I went away.\nAs my mother always says,\nA stitch in time saves nine',\nbut as I always say 'Get your\nbitch arse back in the kitchen,\nand make me some pie!', so\nthat sorts that out...\nThis\nWeek\nFriday Weekend\nUnion\nEvents\nDolly Mixtures\nBig up to the chewy\nsweet massif!

    "content": "back talk\nPrime Minister Binyamin\nNetanyahu. He explained that\nthe Palestinian leader, Yasser\nArafat has himself, been\ndirectly responsible for the terrorist attacks. Furthermore he\nhas incited such hatred of\nIsrael in his people that peace\nnow seems more distant than\never. The word 'Peace1 1\nin\nPalestinian society has\nbecome a metaphor, for \"push-ing the Jews into the\nMediterranean Sea.\"\nNetanyahu was cheered and\napplauded when he proclaimed that the only way to\npeace is not VIA Arafat, but\nrather OVER Arafat. He has\nfailed the Israelis as a partner\nfor peace but more importantly has failed his own people, in\ntheir legitimate desire for a state.\nMost people would agree\nthat the Palestinians have the\nright, like all nations, to self-determination. Sadly they\nchose to embark on a path of\nviolence and terror, in order to\nachieve their goals, and this is\nunacceptable. Negotiations\ncannot resume whilst the\nIsraelis have a gun to their\nhead and suicide bombers are\nexploding all over the country.\nIn a recent visit to Israel I was witness to the daily routine of fear and insecurity to\nwhich the Israeli people have\nbecome accustomed. Not\nbeing able to go to a coffee\nshop, a supermarket, in fact\nanywhere out of their homes,\nwithout the fear of being\nblown to bits. No country in\nthe world would be expected\nto put up with such a state of\naffairs. It is therefore Israel's right and necessity to defend\nitself, as any country would in\nits position.\nIt angers me to read of the\nso called \"Peace Activists,\" like\nthe one who wrote into Felix\nlast week, that try to prevent\nthe Israeli army from completing its legitimate task of rooting out terrorists and destroying their infrastructure, whilst\nstill managing to maintain the\nhighest moral standards and\ndignity of the innocent populous. It may interest readers to\nknow that many of these\nactivists have recently sheltered and some media personnel have even smuggled out\n(knowingly or not) wanted terrorists from refugee camps\nand into Israel. Ambulances\nwere stopped and searched\nbecause rather than ferry the\nsick and injured, they were\nused to move gunmen and\nexplosives. Most shocking of\nall was the fact that women\nwould sometimes hide explosives under their dresses and\npretend that they are pre g nant, in an attempt to get\nquickly across the Israeli\ncheckpoints.\nThe reality is that the\nactions of the Palestinians and\ntheir leadership at this time,\nare not those of a people that\ndesire peace and an immediate end to violence. To negotiate with and make concessions at a time when young\npeople are still being murdered on a night out in a club,\nwould be foolish and absurd.\nGil Rabbie.\nPlease No More...\nAndy, Andy, Andy, when will\nyou learn? Personal attacks\nnever work.\nYou see I, too, could be per-son al.I could mention your IC\ncareer, both as a medical student and as an officer. But that\nwould be unkind. And I know\nhow upset you'd get.\nSo, let's keep the argument\non the topic shall we? The\nNUS, you remember? This was\nwhere you lied. You lied to the\nclubs. You lied to the societies.\nYou lied to the drinkers in the\nBars and you are lying to yourself if you believe the National\nUnion wouldn't represent your\nviews. You even lied to your\nown campaign team for God's sake! You took two weeks off\ntraining to become a doctor, as\nopposed to my single week.\nAnd then there was what your\nteam actually told the students when they stopped\nthem, which, quite frankly,\ndefies belief.\nAnyway, enough of this. If\nyou believe what you hear,\nthere is a campaign brewing;\nsomething along the lines of\n\"BONUS\" (Bring On NUS) to\nwhich I suspect you'll respond\nsomething equally witty\n(ANUS perhaps? Anti NUS?).\nStill, it's been emotional.
