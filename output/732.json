    "content": "Boat Club\nLast Saturday saw the Boat\nClub racing for the first\ntime this year in open\ncompetition. IC had eight\ncrews entered in the\nHenley Heads of the River\nin a field of 160.\nBoth the elite cox ed and\nsenior cox less fours won\ntheir divisions by\nimpressive margins and\ncame second and third\nrespectively overall, losing\nonly to the elite lea u der cox less four. Although\nthose were the only two\nwins of the day for IC, the\nother crews came well up\nin the ranking. The two\nsenior B cox less fours\ncame second and fourth in\ntheir division, the faster\ncrew only losing by two\nseconds. The senior C cox ed four came eighth in\ntheir division, won by Kjngs\nCollege, London. The Novice squad who\nonly began rowing this\nyear, entered two fours and\ncame second and seventh\nin their division, the 'A' crew only losing by seven\nseconds to a crew in a far\nsuperior boat and after\nbeing held up by another\nboat. The womens' novice\ncox ed four, again racing in\nopen competition for the\nfirst time, came fourth.\nThese results are very\nencouraging for the future,\nespecially as the top two\ncrews now combine to form\nthe first VIII, going on to\nrace the likes of Oxford\nand Cambridge.

It\nwill add a whole new\nmeaning to your ideas of\nbody language and perhaps\nexplain the mystery of why\nsome people wear Brut 33!\nSo for those of you who\nhave missed out on our\nevents so far be there, for\nthis one (no secret hand shakes necessary).\nCycling Club\nOK then, where were you\nall last Sunday? In bed\nprobably. Three people met\nat 10.00am for the weekly\nCycling Club Sunday run,\nand we decided\nunanimously to zip down the A3. Off we set, did we\nhave a headwind? It\ncertainly felt like the wind\nwas against us but we\nnevertheless managed to\nkeep up a fair pace. The original plan was to pay the\ninhabitants of Dorking a short visit, but after we\nmissed the turning, we\nended up in Guildford\nwhere Mars Bars and Coke were the order of the day.\nThe trip back was difficult,\nas we found out that we\nwere now cycling into a fairly strong wind\u2014we had\nthe wind behind us on the\nway there! However, we still\narrived back in South\nKensington just after\n2.00pm. Come on all you cyclists!\nMake 10.00am next Sunday a date for a cycle ride its\nnot that early, and anyway\nthe fresh air is certain to\nwake you up pretty quickly.\nPS May24 th is a date to\nkeep free for the Bicycle Belle-a delightful trip\nthrough the Cotswolds with\na massive tea afterwards.\nFor more details turn up on\nThursday, 12.30, Southside\nUpper Lounge.\nGuilds\nOn Monday papers go up\nfor elections to the City\nand Guilds Union Executive.

You could be the one for the\njob. Come to the office and\nfind out.\nS&GI have written this article\nbecause the paper has\nbeen decidedly weak on\nS&G trips recently. So for\nall you poor students out\nthere cooped up in beds its and flats studiously putting\nyour all into your work\nhere's a breath of the\nSnowdonia air. Yet another\nglimpse of that wonderful\nfreedom that everyone who has a stout pair of legs,\nwaterproof clothing, strong\nboots, a map, torch and\ncompass and the will to get\naway from it all can\nexperience.\nUnfortunately Snowdonia trips with S&G always fall\ninto the same pattern, and\nafter 3 years, its becoming a bit boring. First on\nSaturday there's a crowd\nready to attempt the\nSnowdon horse hose, seven\nof the finest upland miles in\nGreat Britain, wonderful\nscenery and a truly\nenjoyable walk, but is it still\nenjoyable when everyone\ngoes for it everytime? I know I don't enjoy crowds, especially on Crib Go ch when half of them are\ncoming towards you. The knife edge becomes tricky\nthen, so as happens most\nyears a small contingent\n(about 12 of us, forty were\non the trip), headed for\nTryfan and the Glydyrs.\nAgain an enjoyable\nscramble with some good\nwalking. This time though\nthe weather was against us,\ntoo windy by half and\ndangerous as Tryfan was\ncovered in ice. Nine of us\ncame down after getting\nthree quarters of the way\nup, approximately 2700 feet\nabove sea level. We had\ntaken the North ridge but\nfound it too icy nearer the\ntop.

Do some more\nexploring, give it a try!\nid Firmly clutching his loofah,\nthe writer wondered what\nto do next. He knew what\nhe would like to do next.\nBut, he mused, it was\nprobably illegal and\nanyway the nearest farm\nwas miles away. His early\nmorning reverie was\ndisturbed by a stoat flying\nin through the bathroom\nwindow and s tricking him\nciar ply on the cranium.\nRetrieving the\nunfortunately beast from\nthe washbasin, the writer\nfound a note tied around its\nneck. Written in green\ncrayon, the note read as\nfollows: KUM TO THE NECK ST QT MEAT IN GORI 'LL KIK Y OR HE D INN'\nSome of the writing was\njoined up, he noted\nappraising ly, that must\nhave taken the Chairman hours.\nArriving at the meeting\nearly, the writer was met by\nthe irate chairman. The\nlatter was, as always,\nimmaculately dressed,\nsporting a three piece suit\nof finest red striped\nwallpaper, complete with\nmatching cheque book. 'Now look', began the\nchairman, 'you have missed\nthree meetings in a row.\nAny more of this\nabsenteeism and I shall\nhave to take away your\nexecutive perks.'\nSuch as?' Inquired the\nwriter. 'Use of the executive\nashtray' snapped the\nchairman, who frequently\nsnapped under pressure.

The only reason I offered to chair the meeting\nwas I thought it would\nmake it easier for Ian to put\nforward his views if not in\nthe chair. On reflection it\nwas obviously wrong to\nattempt to chair the\nmeeting as I do UG M's. we\nall make mistakes!\nI would like however to\nuse this space to\ncongratulate Ian on the\nhard work he has\nundertaken in an attempt to\nbetter Security in\nSouthside. The lack of\nSecurity in Southside has\nbeen of concern to me\nduring my three years as\nSubwarden of FalmouthK eo gh Hall and I can\nassure all residents that\n'any moves to improve the\nsituation have my full\nbacking.\n\u2022'Yours apologetically\n\\Chris Hendy\n;|TO WHOM IT MAY; CONCERN| On Sunday, 16th February,\nI attended a meeting with\nvarious Southside residents\nconcerning the security in\nSouthside. The meeting\nwas at 9.00pm and I regret\nto say I turned up more\nthan somewhat inebriated.\nHaving been reminded of\nthe meeting earlier during\nthe day, after I had started\ndrinking, I should then\nhave taken the decision not\nto attend the meeting.\nUnfortunately I did not take\nthat decision and so made\na mistake* I have been informed that\nmany people were upset\nover my conduct at the\nmeeting, and so I should\nlike to take this opportunity\nto apologise to them. I should also like to explain\nthat the security situation\nin Southside has been fully\ninvestigated and plans are\nunder way to increase the\nsecurity there.\nThere have been many\nproblems in the past and\nwe have tried this time to\ncome up with a viable\nsolution. If anyone would\nlike to come and see me to\ndiscuss this or any other\nmatter please feel free to\ndo so.\nCarl Burgess\nPresident\n17 February 1986\nDear Mr Southey,\nI speak for a large number\nof IC students when I say\nthat, frankly, we're getting\nbored stiff by some of the\nmaterial which has been\nappearing in the FELIX\n'letters' pages recently.\nSome FELIX Hacks think\nthey're being amazingly\nfunny by s lagging off other\npeople without having the\nguts to sign their names at\nthe bottom, preferring to\nuse some pseudo-comical .\n'Star Trek' names instead.\nJames E Kirk (Captain\nKirk?) who wouldn't wear a tie to a 'Crazy Tie' party,\nseems to me the sort of\nperson who would go to a1920's party in a pink toga\nand to a vicars and tarts\nparty wearing motor-cycle\nleathers. The garbage that\n'Spock' and 'James E Kirk'\nhave been writing is the\nsort of drivel most IC\nstudents sneer at with utter\ncontempt, so I'm sure we'll\nall heave a sigh of relief\nwhen we stop seeing it.\nYours sincerely,\nAlastair Seymour\nElec Eng 1\nSouthside: The\nComplaints\nDear Sir,\nWe have just returned from\na meeting of the\ncommittees of Southside\nHalls. It was called by Mr\nIan Howgate of FalmouthK eo gh and was to concern Security in Southside, a problem of great\nimportance to those who\nlive here.\nIt is the feeling of the\nundersigned that the\nperformance of the Union\nrepresentative present\nshould be brought to the\nattention of the students of\nImperial.\nThe meeting proceeded\nwith speed and efficiency\nunder the chairmanship of\nMr Howgate, until Mr\nBurgess and Mr Hendy\narrived late and under the\ninfluence of alcohol. The best that could be said of\nMr Burgess was that he\ncould still walk.\nThere to all intents and\npurposes the meeting\nstopped, as these two\ngentlemen took control,\nousting Mr Howgate from\nthe chair.\nMr Burgess gave us a long spiel on his virtues as\na representative of IC\nstudents, containing what\nmust by the quote of the\ncentury'., no one ever\nnotices what I do'.\nFollowing this he attempted\nto keep 'bloody order' by\npreventing those with valid\npoints from making them.\nMr Hendy the new\nchairman was noted as\nstopping the meeting seven\ntimes to ask the same\nsimple question, 'Does\nanyone present feel\nsatisfied with security in\nSouthside?' on the last\noccasion he was answered\nwith a resounding ' NO!' Mr\nHowgate left saying the\nmeeting would reconvene\nlater as he walked out in\ndisgust.\nThe last point from the\nfloor was 'could the\nPresident Please be sober\nat the next meeting?' A sentiment echoed by many\nof the assembled students.\nThis point may not have\nmade the minutes as the\nmeeting could be said to\nhave closed, because we\nwere all leaving.\nIf Mr Burgess would wish\nto truly represent IC\nStudents, then perhaps he\nshould arrive on time and\nin a state in which he could\nremember the night before,\nthe morning after.\nWe hope that he, or the\nUnion, would act on this\nobservation and think that\nnot only should the union\nofficials (especially the\nPresident) represent the\nstudents but should also be\nrepresentative of the\nstudents.\nIf Mr Burgess feels that\nhe was in a fit state to\nrepresent the Union at a meeting of students, then\nperhaps both the Union\nand the students of\nImperial should consider\nraising the standards of\ntheir President's behaviour,\nor seriously consider\nelecting someone who's Friday 21 February FELIX\n\n"

Some inconsiderate and probably\npissed Bastard from C&G had chun de red in the van\nand it stank. The journey to\nBrunei was not bad, the\nroads were clear but Capt\nBridger's driving left .\nsomething to be desired.\nDue to some excellent\nnavigation by Le Poisson\nwe arrived half an hour\nearly and picked our 7th man up from Uxbridge\nstation before returning to\nthe ground. It took the\numpires about 45 minutes\nto fix the pitch before we\ntook on the professional\nBrunei side. Capt Bridger\nbatted well in the face of\ntight bowling and fielding\nto return with 25. King and\nDevon were out quickly\nthen Turner and Wright\nbatted well as did Bridger\non his return. Hammer was\nrun out without facing as\nIC closed on 125 for 5 from\n12 overs. The bowling did\nnot match up to the batting\nas Brunei knocked the runs\noff for the loss of two\nwickets with an over to\nspare. Hammer being the\nonly bowler to come out\nwith any credit as he\nbowled his 3 overs for only\n16 runs. After a quick visit\nto Pizza Hut in Uxbridge,\nwe watched Brunei paste\nEast Anglia. We then took\non Surrey. The early\nbowling of Wright and\nDevon restricted Surrey but\nlater on with some smiling\nthey scored freely against\nBridger and Turner, so\nclose on 112 for 4 from 12\novers. IC responded in fine\nfashion with Fish and\nDevon striking the ball well\nwith Fish scoring the\nfastest 25 of the day from\nonly 11 balls in 3 overs\nincluding a6. In the middle\nIC crumbled a bit with\nDevon, King and Turner\ngetting out in quick\nsuccession. Bridger and\nWright then took the score\nto 102 with 10 needed from\n2 overs. Bridger was run\nout followed by Wright who\nstood and watched when\nhe should have run. This\nleft Fish to score 7 on his\nown.

The three\npeople concerned had been\nparticipating earlier in the\nGuilds' Field Cup. They\nwere found immediately by\nthe security guard, and\nwere interviewed by Mr\nReeves of College Security.\nOne of them was suffering\nfrom cuts to the face,\nhands and leg; all three\nclaimed that they had\nsustained these injuries\nafter slipping on the steps\nin front of the shop and\nfalling through the window.\nAlthough Mr Reeves said\nhe was inclined to believe\ntheir story, the security\nguard involved said that he\nthought the incident was\nno accident, and reported\nthat as he arrived on the\nscene, he saw the injured\nstudent kicking at the\nalready shattered shop\nfront. Mr Reeves is\ninvestigating the matter\nfurther. No one was\navailable in the Guilds'\nOffice for comment.\nDiscipline\nSections of the proposed\nnew College Disciplinary\nRegulations were rejected\nby ICU Council, meeting\non Monday evening at the\nCollege Field Station.\nSilwood Park.\nThe draft of the new\nregulations allowed the\npenalty imposed on\nstudents found gui lit y of\nmisconduct to be increased\non appeal. Several\nmembers of Council spoke\nout strongly against\naccepting this, saying that\nit was 'contrary to natural\njustice'. The present\nregulations do not allow\nthe appeal panel to\nincrease the penalty, only\nto confirm or reduce it. The\nnew code was drafted by\nMichael Arthur, former\nStudent Services Officer\nand now Assistant College\nSecretary.\nCouncil amended the\ndraft changing the\noffending phrase so that\nthe penalty may not be\nincreased on appeal.

This\nvenue, which no longer\nexists, gave unknown\nartists the opportunity to\nshow their work. Dr\nHargreaves said he tries to\nkeep the styles and subject\nmatters of the exhibitions\nin College as varied as\npossible. He said that they\nwere usually well attended.\nNo Confidence\nThe University of London\nUnion avoided a vote of no\nconfidence on Tuesday at\nGeneral Union Council.\nRoyal Holloway and\nBedford New College\nStudents' Union had\noriginally proposed the\nmotion.

The apartheid\nsystem has been\ncondemned by the United\nNations as a' Crime against\nhumanity'.\nIn the present 'state of\nemergency', over 900\npeople have died, the vast\nmajority killed by poi.~e and army. Over 15,000\npeople were detained\nwithout trial; up to 80% of\nwhom are believed to have\nbeen subjected to physical\nor psychological torture. In\nNamibia, which is illegally\noccupied by South Africa,\nthe practice of torture by\nthe 100,000 strong South African army of occupation on prisoners is also\nwidespread.\nThe survival of apartheid\nis not due solely to the\nmassive repression by the\nsecurity forces;\nmultinational corporations\nand especially the\ninternational banks, also\nhave their part to play.\nSeveral British banks play\nan important part in this,\nespecially Barclays, and the\nmerchant bank Standard\nChartered (although\nBarclays has by far the\nbiggest stake of the two). Barclays is the only British\nHigh Street bank with a major stake in South Africa.\nBarclays, via its South African subsidiary Barclays National, controls 30% of\nall banking in South Africa,\nand is the largest single\nbank there\u2014its assets\ncome to a staggering \u00a36\nbillion, including over \u00a3145\nmillion in government\nsecurities\nThe bank has taken part\nin massive loans to the\nSouth African government\nand to state corporations\nincluding, in 1980, a \u00a3280m loan to ES COM, the state\nelectricity corporation,\nwhich has recently\nconstructed a \u00a3560 million\nnuclear power station.\nIn 1976, Barclays\npurchased \u00a36 million of\nGovernment Defence\nBonds, thereby directly\nsupporting the South\nAfrican armed forces,\nalthough it was forced to\nsell them a year later after\nan international outcry.\nThis is not the only link\nthat Barclays has had with\n\"Why does a NationalServiceman\nneed a bank?\"\nthe South African Military:Until it was disbanded in\n1982, the Chairman of\nBarclays National was a member of the South\nAfrican Defence Advisory\nBoard, which advised the\narmed forces on arms\nprocurement. The bank has\nalso helped finance arms\nsales to South Africa,\nalthough the bank says\nunknowingly.\nAlthough South Africa's continued occupations of\nNamibia is illegal\n(according to the UN and the International Court),\nBarclays displays its\nacceptance of the\noccupation by operating\nthere; In fact Barclays\ncontrols half of all bank\ndeposits taken in Namibia. From this central role in the\nNamibian economy, Barclays plays a key part in\nchannelling profits from the\ncountry to South Africa-in\n1978 Barclays directed 18%\nof its deposits taken in\nNamibia there.\nBarclays insists that its\ncontinued presence in\nSouthern Africa is a liberal ising influence on the\napart eid regime, and is\nbeneficial to the black\ncommunity. However, the\nbank receives more money from the black community than is returned to it in the\nform of loans or\ninvestments; thereby\nreinforcing the economic barrier that apartheid\neffects. Also, a poll\nconducted by Gallup last\nsummer found that 7% of\nblack South Africans\nsupported international\nsanctions against their\ncountry.\nIn 1981, Barclays was named by the UN as one of\nthe main multinationals\nmaking a 'substantial\ncontribution to apartheid'.\nBecause of its\ninvolvement in South\nAfrica, Barclays has been\nbanned from many\nuniversity campuses. However, on several\noccasions last year (in\nFELIX, the ICU Handbook and PHOENIX) ICU printed\nfull page adverts for\nBarclays Bank. We think IC\nstudents should be\ndiscouraged from opening\naccounts with a bank which is supporting, financal ly,a country whose constitution\nis based on a system of\ninstitutional is ed racism. For those reason, a motion\ncalling on the Union to\ncease to print adverts for\nBarclays Bank has been\nsubmitted for discussion at\nthe UG Mon6 March. We hope you will come and support the motion.\nOF\nCHAIRMAN\nFT\nLE<< \u00a3l~L. YOU\nFriday 21 February FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Ladders\nMy friend Mobius is a dedicated puzzle fanatic.\nSo addicted is he in fact,\nthat he continually invents\npuzzles from everyday\nsituations (much to my\nannoyance). The other day,\nfor example, he told me\nthat on his way to college\nhe was walking down a small alleyway behind his\nhouse The alleyway was 5\nfeet wide. Two ladders\nwere placed so that each\nladder touched the base of\nthe opposite wall to that\nwhich it was leaning on,\nand they both leaned\nagainst different walls. One ladder was 16 feet long, the\nother 11 feet long. What\nMobius wanted to know\nwas; could he, walking in a straight line parr elle l to the\nalleyway, walk under both\nladders without bumping\nhis head (Mobius is\nextremely un supers tito us and will purposely walk\nunder ladders in defiance\nof supernatural forces)?\nMobius wouldn't tell me the\nanswer, he said it wasn't very difficult and I should\ndo it myself. But he did say\nthat I shouldn't take into\naccount the width of his\nhead or the ladders. Can you tell me what answer he\ngot? By the way, Mobius is\n5 feet 11 inches tall.\nRandomly selected\nwinner will receive \u00a35.\nAnswers plus comment etc\nto the FELIX office by\nTuesday lunchtime please.\nIt seems that the problem I set a few weeks ago, tricky\ntriangles, first appeared in .\nFELIX four years ago, in\nMartin S Taylor's excellent\nSCAR A MOU CHE Column. Being quite a clever puzzle-it probably got passed\naround until it reached me,\nso the credit should go to\nMartin. None of the few\nwho entered knew this,\nthough, so no harm done.\nWhat's interesting is that,\nback in 1982 Martin got\neleven correct entries,\nwhile I only got five\nsolutions in total! Has\ninflation so reduced the\nvalue of \u00a35 since 1982?\nActually I 've been a bit .\ndisappointed generally with\nthe response to some of my\nmore interesting problems.\nMy preference is towards\ninspirational type problems\nthat need a flash of insight\nto solve, rather than the\nslog it out permutation\ntype, but the latter\ninvariably get a better\nresponse. Please let me\nknow what you prefer, or\nwhether you think the\nproblems are too hard.\nValentine\nVerisimilitude\u2014Solution\nAndrea sent Oliver's card.\nBarbara sent Neil's card\nChristine sent Pete's card\nDiana sent Luke's card\nElizabeth sent Mike's card\nAndrea was Pete's sister.\nI got eleven entries which\nwere all correct so you\nobviously found this quite\neasy.

Pennies\nWell, even with last week's clues I still received no\nentries to this problem\npity, since I thought it\nquite an interesting on\nand not too difficult. I you thought about it,\nanyway. Here's what I made of it.\nConsider drawing a line\ndown the centre of the\ntable, then, when your\nopponent puts a coin down somewhere, you put yours\nin exactly the same point\nbut reflected in the centre\nline.\nThis means that at any\npoint during the game the\npattern of coins will be\nsymmetric around the\ncentre line, and you will\nalways be able to put a coin down opposite your\nopponent's coin until there\nare no gaps left.\n*****\nhope * f lines and reflect in both of\nthese,\noo\nooo ooo ooo ooo Obviously this only works\nif a) your opponent never\nputs a coin on the centre\nline, and , b) your\nopponent goes first. Thus it\nis not very satisfactory. The next refinement is to draw\ntwo perpendicular centre\nthus exploiting the\ncomplete symmetry of the\ntable. The problem here is\nthat the centre point does\nnot move, so if your\nopponent's coin overlaps\nthe centre you won't be\nable to put yours in the\nreflected position. Still, this\nstrategy always works if\nyou go first (since you can\nnab the centre position and\nthen follow the old\nstrategy) and will probably\nwork if you go second, as\nlong as your opponent\nnever puts his coin over the\nmiddle of the table.\nThis is as far as I could\nget with this one. If this\ninspires you to think of any\nbetter strategies, please let\nme know.\n5mal ANNOUNCEMENT\n\u2022TRAFFIC WARDENS\u2014TO DEPT\nHEADS\u2014A PLEA If you have a visitor who has to bring in a car\nplease contact the GATEHOUSE(3395) and we will arrange a parking\nbay for you.

    "content": "Five-a side\nAlthough reeling from\nsensational tabloid\ndisclosures alleging that\nfour of the IC squad had\nbeen found vanquishing in\nthe gutter outside Durham's trendiest night-club, coach Rob Clarke's footballing\nelite still managed to\nstumble their way to the\nsemi-finals of last Sunday's tournament, before\nadmitting defeat in order to\ncatch the last train home.\nHangovers were lifted\nearly on as Dave Lynne\nmaintaining a scoring run\nwhich had begun the\n.previous night, put IC\nahead in the opening group\ngame v Bradford. Hopes of\na good start were dashed, however when Bradford\nequalise d with the last kick\nof the game; the headaches\nand dry mouths soon returned.\nU WIST proved a tough\nnut to crack in the second game, as chances came and went, and another\nstalemate seemed likely\nwhen tragedy struck.\nEngberg was harshly\nadjudged to have\nencroached into his own\narea, and the resultant\npenalty, clinically\ndespatched, plunged IC\ndeep into a crisis.\nFearing his job was on\nthe line, Rob Clarke\npressed the panic button\nand rang the changes,\ndropping top-scorer Lynne\nand the ever-popular but\nstrangely leg-weary (?!)\nGoldsworthy for the final\ngroup match. His\ncontroversial moves looked\nto be vindicated when Alex\nLunghi fired home a beauty\nonly for the pressures of\nmanagement to return as\nNottingham equalise d against the run of play.\nWith the title slipping away,\nIC's travelling support\nturned spitefully on the\nbele a gu red Clarke, and\ncalls for his head grew\ndeafening. Engberg\nrealising his managers'\ndesperate plight,\nbludgeoned his way\nthrough three tackles, and\nwith the referee's whistle\npoised for action, crashed\nthe ball into the roof of the\nnet for a sensational\nwinner.\nSneaking through one\ngoal difference, IC were\npaired with Birmingham in\nthe quarter-finals. An ashen\nfaced Barnes kept his\nplace, much to the disgust\nof the still axed\nGoldsworthy, although\nLynne was restored to add\nsome much needed charm\nto the front line. Two quick\ngoals from our latter day\nRomeo killed the tie as a spectacle and the\nentertainment value was\nnot aided by the 2nd half\nappearance of stopper\nClarke in order to protect\nthe precious lead. With\nonly home favourites\nDurham now standing\nbetween IC and a coveted\nfinal spot, the talk was of\nglory and medals and beer\nuntil it was discovered that\nanother win would mean a night on the snow-covered\ncobbles of Tyneside.\nCommon sense prevailed\nand the Oxbridge rejects\nwere gifted a couple of\nsimple strikes, thereby\nhanding Loughborough an\neasier than expected ride in\nthe final. The Sports\nscientists were no doubt\nrelieved that their most\ndangerous opponents had\nby that time boarded the\n6.37 to London King's Cross, safe in t ne knowledge that the\ninhabitants of Durham were1 glad to see the back of :\nthem.\nBoat\nHenley Fours Head\nImperial College Boat Club picked up another two wins\nat the weekend and were\nclose to winning several\nother divisions. The Elite\ncox ed four having broken\ntheir fin and rudder on the\nway to the start required\nBill Mason to make hasty\nrepairs Despite this and\nstarting out of position they\nwon their division weaving\ntheir way through many\nslower crews. The other\nwin came for the senior A Cox less four.

All the initial\nenthusiasm seems to be\npetering out as thoughts\nturn to exam preparation\nfollowed by summer\nholidays or jobs. This is\nwhere you begin to s uss how apathetic and boring\ncollege can really be. Most\nof you are probably\nhanging around in your\nown little groups of friends,\ngoing out to the same sort\nof places and not bothering\ntoo much about looking for\nsomething radically\ndifferent\u2014all fair enough in\nits own way I suppose.\nFittingly this year's 'total\nhype' group Sick Sick\nSputnick, or however you pronounce it, have chosen this time to release their\ndebut single. Having\nalready devoted too much\nspace to it I 'll just say that\nit actually appears to be\nGiorgio Moron or someone and has a title about 'love\nmissiles' which seems like\nit might have been pinched\nfrom the spoof film 'Spinal\nTap'.\nIf you intend to write a column about alternatives\nto work, it seems to me you\nshould try and understand\nsomething about the\nstudent psychology.\nPersonally I must confess\nI'm still struggling in this\nfield\u2014at the moment things\nseem to run along the lines\nof 'labs and problem sheets\nare so tedious, boring and\nunimaginative that any old\ngore movie is likely to be\nmore mentally stimulating'.\nIn fact the more I think\nabout it the more I come to\nthe conclusion that the\nworst thing about College is that there is an\nunderlying ten dancy to\ndrive peoples thoughts\naway from reality.\nBefore I get carried away\nwith columns about us all\nsuffering from mass mental\nillness I think I 'll skip\nstraight to the point (calling\nyour readers a bunch of\nn utters is poor house style\nanyway).\nOccasionally even the\ndullest undergraduates can\nshow a potential for\nconcern about greater\nthings than their starting\nsalary (who wants to\nemploy a boring yuppie\nengineer whose sole\ninterest is bank balance\ncollecting anyway?). While\nyou all sit there\ncomfortably folding this\npage into a paper dart to\nlob at your poor innocent\nmaths lecturer millions of\nother poor innocents\naround the world are being\nterror is ed, persecuted,\nexploited and tortured by\ngovernments less\nrestrained than ours (and\nyou thought governments\nwere there to take care of\nyou). The Human Race learns very slowly from its\nmistakes. But op pert unities to learn from history\nabound in London. One of\nthe best documentaries of\nhow tyranny affects\nordinary people was the\nwriting of Anne Frank who\nwas a victim of a regime\nwhose hideousness was\nmade unique from many\nothers past and present\nmainly by the scale of its\nhorror. There is an Anne Frank exhibition at the Mall\ngalleries, Pall Mall until\nMarch2. Entrance is,\nappropriately for the\ncircumstances of many of\nus, free.\nWhile I'm in a 'self-nih list' mood I think I 'll move on to\nmusic. Punk may be dead\nbut that's no reason to\navoid live gigs where the\nemphasis is on gut\nwrenching power and\nvitriolic vocal contortions\n(what a pretentious little\nphrase). The Swedish group Leather Nun last\ntoured this country some\nyears ago with Throbbing Gristle, when they became notorious for leaving a trail\nof riots. They return this\nTuesday 25 to play at the\nBull & Gate, Kentish Town, with Zodiac Mindwarp &\nthe Love Reaction. Cost is\n\u00a33 for what should be an\nOTT gig.\nHaving hyped Half Man Half Biscuit it would be a bit hypocritical to slag\nthem now, especially\nbefore I 've actually heard\nall of their new EP, The Trumpton Riots.

Iam an\nMSc computing student\nmyself and I have seen\nMSc Postgraduate students\nwho think that they have\nthe making of a politician\nby the swagger and display\nthey put into their\n'questions'.\nFortunately, I happen to\nfall into the alternative\ndescription of MSc students: 'Most MSc' s are\ngreat guys/women...'. As such I would like to advise\n3rd year Computing Undergraduate to be more\ncircumspect in his\ncategorising IC student\npopulation into 3 distinct\ngroups because by a single\nexample and one fell stroke\nof his pen, he has\nconsigned all MSc' s to\neternal infamy. After all, all\nopinions are like arse holes everybody has one.\nYours sincerely,\nMSc Computing Student\nName withheld by request\nMoonie Blues\nPart 2\nDear Hugh, I read Mike Bal comb's letter in last weeks FELIX\nwith some interest, noting\nin particular his extensive\nuse of one study as proof\nthat his organisation\n( CARP) is not the ogre\n'Moonie Blues' makes it out\nto be.\nHaving twice read Dr\nBarber's book 'The Making of a Moonie' (there's no\nneed to spend \u00a312, as there\nis a copy in the Haldane\nLibrary) I would like to\nshare a few observations.\nDr Barber was 'chosen'\nby the Unification Church to conduct her study s as\nshe was unlikely to be\nbiased against the church at the start. This is not\nmeant to suggest that\nfunding came for within the\nUnification Movement\n(infact, the SSR C footed\nmuch of the bill), but it\nmust be borne in mind that\nit was the Moon ies who\nasked Eileen Barber to\ninvestigate their\norgans ation. While she was\nnot a UC member, she had\nhad some contact with\nthem, and had not\nappeared to be\nunsympathetic.\n'The making of a Moon ie' covers quite extensively\nreceiving technique (as\nobserved), but, quite\nrightly draws conclusions only as far as the volume of\nevidence permits. The evidence came partly from\nfirst-hand experience in a number of unification\ncentres and partly from\nquestion aires and\ninterviews with past and\npresent (then) UC members. Needless to say,\nthe current members were,\nto man, adam ent that they\nhad not been brainwashed.\nSome of the 'leave rs' had\ndifferent ideas. Mr Bal combs suggestion that\nallegations of brainwashing\nhave been discontinued is,\nof course, indefensible\n(Witness FELIX, 31 2 86)\nIf time permitted, it would\nbe tempting to discuss the\npolitical activities of the UC and the morality of the\nunification concept of\n'Divine Deception'.\nHowever, in conclusion I would rather remind\nreaders that, while CARP, the Unifcation church, the\nHoly Spirit Association for\nUnification of world\nChristianity, and all the\nother related organisations\nmay, legally speaking be\nquite separate they have in\ncommon the policies,\nprinciples and aims of the\nRev Sun Myung Moon.

I can't type, know no shorthand\nand even if I could pay\nsomebody to do it all for\nme I probably wouldn't because I'm a mean\nbastard. Or I would be if I had any money to be mean\nwith.

And a bit before\nthat as well. Grammar wasn't spoken of, weekly\nspelling tests were in and\nvery little else. A few years\nago a woman who used to\nlive next door to us\ncommented to my mother\non how well-spoken I now\nwas 'and him having been\nin remedial English class\ntoo!' I was outraged at this\nslur on my ability, I 've\nnever been remedial in my\nlife, the cheek of it all. Now here I am and I feel\nextremely, well, remedial. A girl at a party last week\nintroduced me to\nsomebody as 'the guy who\nis quite good at tennis but\nshit at computing'.

But\nthere you are. Still, I hope.\nThere I mean. And there\nstill is that 4-letter word, I don't seem to know of a better one. A letter in an\nold technology Sunday newspaper from a sub editor on a new one who is\nnot only ashamed of his\naction (of staying on the\nstaff) but not brave enough to leave struck me as\ncuriously strong. Able to\nput his name to a letter of\nsuch force and clarity as he\ndid, abusing himself in the\nnational press, perhaps he\nis one of a growing number\nof people equipped with\nthe skills to survive in an\nage, and a Britain, long\ngone past, never I think to\nreturn.

The meeting had been called by\nIan Howgate, a Falmouth Keo gh resident who had\ndone a survey on the extent\nof thefts from rooms and mail racks. The object of\nthe meeting was to have\nbeen for Ian to present his\nview of the problem to\ninterested students and to\ncanvas for suggestions. I understand Ian had\nconsulted the Southside wardens about the problem and that they had agreed\nthat this should be a residents campaign independent of the\nwardens, who have been\nmaking their own efforts on\nthe subject for sometime.\nCarl Burgess, as\npresident of the Union, had\nbeen invited to attend to\nlisten to the residents case.\nHowever Mr Burgess arrived obviously somewhat inebriated and proceeded to interrupt Ian and anyone else who spoke, to ramble\nincoherently about how capable he was and to slag\noff those expressing concern. The situation was made no better by Chris He nd y, Falmouth Keo gh sub warden, who offered to\nhelp Ian by chairing the\nmeeting. Unfortunately Mr\nBurgess was allowed to\ncontinue making a fool of\nhimself and no attempt was\nreally made to let Ian put\nhis case before a discussion was started. To be fair the situation was not\nhelped by two other people\npresent who seemed intent\non challenging every trivial\npoint, but in a short period\nof time people who should know better had caused an\nimportant meeting to\ndegenerate to a farce. At\nthis point Ian led a walk out\nby most of the residents\npresent.\nSouthside security is a very serious issue, it is a problem that has been\nallowed to continue far too\nlong. When people who are\nsupposed to represent us,\nand I really mean Carl\nBurgess, behave like total\nwally's over matters which were obviously of concern to a large number of people\nit is time to worry. Mr\nBurgess was intent on\ninsisting that the matter be\nleft to him but how, can we\nfrankly be expected to trust\nin Carl when he is totally\nincapable of showing ordinary students that he is\ntrustworthy. Some may say\nthat it is too late in the year\nto think about votes of no\nconfidence, but the\nsituation cannot be allowed\nto continue without some comment. It is important\nthat people who get elected\nshould not be allowed to\nthink that they cannot be\nheld responsible for their\nincompetence, and I for\none would support a motion censuring Carl Burgess for his stupid\nbehaviour.\nMark Cottle\nFalmouth Keogh Resident\nDear FELIX, This evening at Falmouth\nKeo gh Hall, we attended a meeting concerning the\nstate of security in the halls\nof residence.\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that at present\nscarcely a day passes\nwithout some example of\nabysmal neglect in this\narea. During recent weeks residents' mail has been\nrepeatedly stolen, machines vandalised etc. We discovered today, that only\non Friday two rooms within\nthe Southside complex were entered, probably with\none of the myriad of master\nkeys which are freely\navailable to all and sundry,\nand in one of these rooms a wallet and \u00a31,000 worth\nof camera equipment was removed. This happened at\n1.15pm at which time the\nresident was taking a shower on the same landing.\nAt the meeting, the\nattitude displayed by the\nsub warden Chris He nd y was somewhat akin to his\nattempts to quiet en the\nnoisy and vacuous at IC\nU GM' s.He was severely\nout of touch with the need\nfor action rather than the\n- \u2022 J\"\" sound of his own voice authorities to instigate any ff R being exercised.

    "content": "FILM\nAgnes of God is an excellent\nfilm. The introduction to the\ncharacters is indicative of\nNorman Jenison's intelligent\ncontrol of character and plot.\nMeg Tilly is brilliant as the\ninnocent nun, Sister Agnes,\naccused of murdering her baby.\nHer introduction is first through\nher pure and piercing religious\nsinging and then visually\nshrouded in a heavenly light\n(one of the many fine examples\nof photographer Sven Nykvist's contributions). The protective\nMother Superior, Ann Bancroft,\nis first seen disdainfully\nobserving the psychiatrist, Jane\nFonda, and then smiling away\nand confessing to a former\nsmoking habit in excess of Ms\nFonda's 'Two packs a day...unfiltered'. Jane Fonda\nonce again plays her usual\ncharacter, an independent,\ndetermined woman who doesn't get pushed around by anyone.\nThe tranquility of the convent\nis shattered first by the\nchildbirth screams of Agnes and\nthen by the subsequent\ndiscovery of a strangled baby in\nher locked room. Jane Fonda, Dr\nLivingston, is appointed by the\ncourt to determine whether\nAgnes is mentally fit to stand\ntrial. This then leads her into\nconflict with the Mother Superior\nwho resents the probing and\ngodless methods of psychiatry\nand who fears that Dr\nLivingston's investigations will\ndrive Agnes away from God. She\nalso comes into conflict with the\nBishop and the court authorities\nwho want a quick and clean trial\nand who appear to have little\nsympathy for Agnes.\nOne of the great strengths of\nthis film is the ambivalent\nrelationship between the Mother\nSuperior and the psychiatrist\nwhose background contains\nmany reasons to resent the\noppressive and guilt-ridden\nnature of Catholicism. Another\nstrength is the stunning\nperformance of Meg Tilly who\nmakes a thoroughly convincing\nand worrying ly impressive loony.\nShe is a complete innocent\nwhose early life was severely\ncorrupted and whose education\nwas terminated by her insane\nmother. She has little knowledge\nof body development and\nregards the growth of breasts as\na tendency to flab and that this\nshould be combatted by starving\nherself to the thinness that she\nsees in all the religious icons\naround her. She has come to\nbelieve that 'suffering is\nbeautiful' and that ' God hates fat\npeople'. Her innocence also\nleads her to believe very peculiar\nthings about the origins of\nbabies. The direction by Norman\nJenison is simple and\nuncluttered but yet very skilled\nwith some wonderful set pieces\nsuch as the hy|. .os is scene with\nthe ever present oppressive\nCatholicism symbolised by the\nlarge cross above Agnes. It is\nprobably the best film so far this\nyear, and probably one of the\nbest of the year.\nOn a completely different tack\nis another film to come out this\nweek, Commando. In spite of\nending with 'o' like Macho or\nRambo it is a good film. What\nsaves it from being the standard\nmacho military machine against\nthe evil thousands is the\nstrength of the female\ncharacters. They are there not\nsimply as sex or love interests or\nmerely to be rescued or avenged\nfor, but are strong capable\ncharacters essential to the\ndevelopment of the plot. The\nother strong point in this film's favour is it's sense of humour; it\nis deliberately very funny in\nparts.\nColonel John Matrix, Arnold\nSchwarzenegger, is the former\nleader of an elite military squad\nwho were instrumental in\ndeposing an evil dictator and\ninstalling a democratic\ngovernment in a South American\ncountry. The aforementioned\ndictator then conspires to kidnap\nMatrix's daughter in order to\nD'H LAWRENCE Lady Chatterley's Lover\npersuade him to assist the\ndictator regain power. Of course\nArnold is having none of this....\nThe humour in the film is\nlargely introduced through the\nwonderful Rae Dawn Chong who\nplays a stewardess, initially an\nunwilling, but finally a useful\nand resourceful ally to-Arnold.\nShe is not only very witty but\nalso intelligent and capable,\nincluding saving his life.\nThe ending is the usual one\nman against impossible odds,\nbut the film does at least take\ntime to develop another side to\nMatrix's character, that of the\nloving father, and this is done\npretty well by Arnold. A further\nplus for the film is the lack of\npolitics, the baddies are not bad\nbecause they have the wrong\nideology but because they have\ndecide ly anti-social habits.\nAnyway, I enjoyed it.\nThis is a good week for films.\nAnother film that opened\nrecently is the astonishing\nStreetwise, a documentary about\nkids living on the streets of\nSeattle, Gateway to Alaska. If\nyou didn't see it for yourself you\nwould find the situation these\nchildren are in wholly\nunbelievable.\nThe documentary reveals\nsome incredible attitudes\namongst the kids for their\nparents, 'They're part of my past'\nKim, 16, and the parents for their\nkids. 'It's a phase she's going\nthrough' says a mother about\nher prostitute daughter who is\npicking up clients before her\nfirst period.\nThe film contains some great\nmusic (though not enough) by\nTom Waits and a wonderful\nversion of 'Teddy Bears Picnic'\nby Baby Gramps. Though the\nfilm is open to the well founded\ncharge of voyeurism, it is made\nwith honesty and sympathy and\nthe presentation of the material\n(92 minutes from 56 hours of\nfilm and 26 hours of interviews)\nshows a genuine concern for the\nplight of the children, and is a credit to the cameraman,\ndirector Martin Bell and editor\nNancy Baker.\nIt is always compelling,\nsometimes funny and sometimes\ntearfully poignant, take a deep\nbreath and go and see it.\n0\n'Fancy a Quickie?'\n'How much luv?'\n'\u00a32.95'\nBeing given a copy of Lady\nChatterley's Lover for Valentines\nDay, I decided to review it for all\nyou love/lust (delete as\napplicable) hungry IC students.\nIt really is remarkable how by\ndefying convention a mediocre\nbook such as this receives the\nadulation worthy of a work of\ngenius\u2014which it certainly isn't. Perhaps his early death gave\nhim his mystical popularity.\nThe story is about the\naristocratic Constance having an\naffair with Mellors, her disabled\nhusband's gamekeeper, getting\npregnant and leaving her stately\nhome. This is all fairly\npredictable but doesn't quite\ncome off especially at the end\nwhen the plot telescopes\nsomewhat\u2014in fact the book is\ndownright boring, despite the\nrelatively rare 'juicy bits' that\ngenerations of voyeurs have\nrummaged for.\nThroughout this book I had\nthe impression that DH Lawrence was a misogynist of\nthe highest calibre\u2014women\nshould be seen and not heard,\nand certainly not have an\norgasm unless their (male)\nsexual partner is having one at\nthe same time. Whatever the\ndubious wisdom of two people\nwho hardly knew each other\nhaving sex, 'Lady Chatterley'\nshowed women as primarily for\nmens' gratification, which\nreveals him to be as narrow\nminded as the so-called\nVictorian prudes.\nIt's late in the year, and there's no grant left, but college food is\ninedible and the kitchens\ncovered in grease and moving\nfur balls. Solution\u2014take the\nbank manager out for a meal at\nLe Bistingo and let her/him pay.\nUnlike the Stockpot (behind\nHarrods) or the Kwality Curry\nHouse (near South Ken station),\nLe Bistingo isn't the cheapest of\nnutrient retail businesses. Its\nabout \u00a310-\u00a315 per head but you\nget what you pay for, which can\nbe 3/4 courses of exquisite\nFrench food plus wine\u2014and the\nportions aren'tm ingy either.\nOn my last visit my partner\nand I tucked into fried\nmushrooms\u2014deliciously light\nand crisp with a sharp tart are sauce, then I followed with an\novercooked duck with orange\nsauce\u2014the only blight on the\nmeal, while my friend ate a small\nveal esc a lope. On a previous\noccasion I enjoyed a large dish\nof Boeuf Bourguignon (fancy\nstew and rice) which was very\ntasty. We didn't fancy anything\non the sweet trolley, but the\nlarge glasses of ice cream, nuts\nand chocolate we finished with\nwere a fitting complement to the\nmeal.\nLe Bistingo has a small\nselection of fairly good\nwines\u2014the house white at \u00a33.95\na bottle was crisp and kind to\nthe palate, and the service was\nunobtrusive and friendly. You\ncan find this pleasant little den,\nwhich is very romantic with\nflowers and candles on the\ntables, on Old Brompton Road,\njust South of South Kensington\nStation.\n/\nFriday 21 February\n\n"
