    "content": "Football\n\u2022 Mens 1s tsv UCL\nHockey\n3-0 1st XI V UCL\nA workman-like performance by the 'Reds' saw them\novercome a lively UCL side with some lethal finishing.\nUCL started strongest and only Si Holden's diving\nblock kept the scores level. IC gradually got used to\nthe UCL crunching challenges and began to assert\nthemselves. They took the lead somewhat against the\nrun of play, after Adam Thomas was in the box. Tim\nFisher converted the resulting penalty. They extended\ntheir lead after winning a free-kick for swearing. The\nball was driven into the box and Adam Thomas looped\na header into the top right corner.\nIC started the second half much stronger and\nseveral chances went close before Femi Omatoya\nwrapped up the match with a blistering right foot shot\nthat gave the keeper no chance. Indeed he might have\nhad a second minutes later, but the post came\nbetween him and glory. This win maintains IC 1sts100% record and they are yet to concede a goal.\nLadies v UCL 2-9\nThe recently set up ladies football team got off to a lightening start on Wednesday 11th with a92 defeat\nagainst UCL!\nThe 2 goals were scored by Sophia Bustanante and\nKatie, a player lent to us by UCL! Tricia Bradley gave\na startling performance with a nifty little header during\nthe second half-this unfortunately left her 2 inches\nshorter with no neck, she did, however, make a good\nrecovery in the bar afterwards. Janet Leah gave a good defence backed up by Antonetta Loba in goal.\nMandy Tayler and Diana Marshe made the occasional\nburst through the defence but alas their dynamic right\nwing was too much for us and we were forced to\nconcede 9 goals and 2 cardiac arrests by full-time.\nBeing attached to the men's football club has helped\nus a lot with the organisation and it has meant that\nwe have our own kit-a nice blue striped little\nnumber-and, of course, a ball to play with. We have\nmanaged to slip into the London league and other\nfixtures include the UAU, four-a side and six-a side\ntournaments. So it looks like a busy season ahead.\nAny aspiring footballers are welcome to come along\nand play-the only prerequisite is that you must be\nfemale.\nRugby\nIC v London Hospital\nSunday 22nd October\n17-7\nIC, sporting a new look kit, began this year's challenge\nfor the Gutteridge Cup with a good win over London\nHospital. Conditions for good rugby were made almost\nimpossible by a gale force wind blowing down the\nfield. Each half, obviously, was biased to the team\nwith the 'wind'.\nIC lost the toss and faced kicking off with the\nelements. Importance of scoring points, with our\nadvantage, was uppermost. However IC started\nslowly, amassing only a10 point lead at half time.\nScore 13-3, thanks to tries by Simon Bicknell and\nMike Anderson. Anderson also put over one\nconversion and a penalty.\nLondon Hospital, playing with the wind, scored a giveaway try, due to slack defence from IC. This\nsparked something in the recesses of the IC lads'\nminds. Inspirationally playing out of their skins for the\nremainder of the match Simon Bicknell scored a try\nfrom a solid sc rummage on the opponents' line, right\nin the dying moments.\nIC face either Kings or Barts next round.\n4-1\nAfter a nervous start, and a00 score against us the\nweek before, IC 1sts played some good strong\nhockey. The first half was slow with neither side on\ntop and both teams having several chances. In the\nsecond half IC played a confident game and within the\nfirst ten minutes Phil Stubs placed a beautiful pass to\nMark London who hit the ball through the keeper's legs. The game then suddenly picked up with some\ndynamic hockey in midfield. Then a cross from right\nallowed Mike Marshal to put the ball into the back of\nthe net. UCL then began to flow nder and a miss-hit\nfrom their defence again gave Mark London a chance\nto place his second into the net.\nUCL in a frenzy suddenly picked up the pace of their\ngame, placing a lot of pressure on the IC defence who\nbroke and IC let in their first goal. Then came a 'pseudo' cross from the right winger Gary\nKnaresborough on the half-way line to Duncan Fitter,\nwho had made a run from the left wing and after\npassing one defender and into the goal making the\nscore 4-1 to IC at the end of the game. A good start\nto the league.\nIsts v PHC Chisich 2-1\nAfter a40 defeat against this team last year, IC 1 sts\nstarted the game with some apprehension!\nLittle occurred in the first half, and play was fairly\neven. PHC Chisich did settle first into some good hard\nhockey, but IC continued to place pressure on them\nand try one hundred per cent.\nThe second half started with PHC forcing IC into\na defensive role. It was fifteen minutes from the end\nwhen our goalkeeper James Whitelaw unfortunately\ngave away a penalty flick, and they put the first goal\naway.\nThis single event suddenly increased the pace of the\nmatch. Several times IC broke forward but to no avail.\nThen suddenly IC put together a very simple move:\ngood sharp, clean passes which left Mike Marshal\nwith an open goal to place the first IC goal of the day.\nWithin two minutes of restarting IC were again\nattacking with Mark London cracking a shot which\ndeflected off the keeper and up into the net.\nPHC Chisich then played some good astro hockey\nbut IC held them off.\n2nd sv UCL 6-0\nLast Wednesday saw the destruction of a UCL team\nfresh from the summer break. The game started quite\nevenly, but more and more possession was gained by\nIC as four completely new teams pulled together.\nDave Millard kindly volunteered to umpire the first half\nbut much to IC's amazement disallowed a short corner\ngoal. The 2nds preserved and managed to break\nthrough in the shape of a good individual goal from\nMark Londan. He again scored as the ball struck the\nbackboard from a short corner. Don Howard, on his\ndebut, managed to make it 3 before the umpire\nredeemed himself and gave a penalty flick. Mark just\nmanaged to get it in to get a well deserved hattrick\nas the half-time whistle went.\nFrom then on IC were on top but we could only\nmanage 2 goals in the 2nd half despite having all the\npossession^Dave Millard, on the pitch this time,\ncreamed the ball to almost knock the corner out of\nthe goal, and Hassan Majid got on the score sheet to\nmake it 6-0 to IC.\nThere should be a good season ahead with a good\nintake of fresher s and better performances from the\n'oldies'.\n4th sv St Georges 3-2\nThis friendly fixture signified the start of the season\nfor the newly-formed 4th s and we were apprehensive\nwhen only 7 players turned up. However we soldiered\non, having borrowed a substitute from the Ists,\nagainst a full St Georges' team. The first half saw IC\nin charge of the game with our kicking back spending\nmost of his time resting against the side of the post\nwhile the rest of the team attacked the St Georges'\nhalf. We were rewarded shortly with our first goal\nfrom Andrew Talby. However a penalty corner just\nbefore the end of the half levelled the score for St\nGeorges.\nThere then followed a period when both teams tried\nto kill each other resulting in one broken nose, one cut\nlip and one bruised kneecap.\nThe 4th s fought back hard and the centre half,\nAdam Pritchard, found the back of the net after an\naccurate pass from the right half. By this time\neverybody was tiring, except for our Kicking Back\nJames Larkins who needed a change. Charging up the\nfield and arrived in front of the net just in time to meet\nthe ball, which he promptly despatched. The final\nscore suggests a good season for the 4th s when we\nreach full strength.\nRowing\nUpper Thames Fours Head, Henley on Thames\nSunday 22nd October\nSunday saw the 1st and 2nd IC fours in the first race\nof the year. Racing at Senior I level IC 'A' not only\nwon their own division but were easily the fastest\ncox less four. They beat all the elite crews, and were\nonly narrowly squeezed from second place overall by\nthe supposedly much faster quadruple sculls. IC 'B' raced Senior II cox less fours, storming their own\ndivision and barely missing being the 2nd fastest\ncox less four.\nResults:\n1 IC 'A'10'.24\"2 Thames Tradesmmen RC\n3 IC 'B' Senior I410'.43\" Open 4 -10'.45\" Senior II 4 -Page 22\n\n"

    "content": "Sailing by\nThis weekend saw eight brave souls struggling up to\nthe Welsh Harp in Wembley, for a team racing event.\nOn arrival we discovered that not only was it raining,\nbut, that waves had somehow miraculously appeared\non the reservoir. Of course this could have been due\nto the fact that the wind was very strong. In fact, after\nseveral postponements, the race committee decided\nto only let us race with four roll reefs in the sails, only\nto change this to six after the first race.\nThe Foot, which is the event's name, is run by the\nCastaways (ex-University of London sailors) and\nattracts top teams from all over the country, this year\nthere were 19 teams, organised into two leagues.\nIn our league there were nine teams, including the\ncombined British Universities team and the University\nof London team. The Imperial College team performed\nvery well given the conditions and remembering that\nthis was the first time we had sailed in a race as a team. Unfortunately due to the force of the wind we\nwere beset by gear failure, such that in every race only\ntwo out of our three boats actually crossed the\nfinishing line. However, we kept up with the other\nteams, showing a very respectable result. The high\nspot was, however, coming joint first in the race\nagainst the University of London team (the UL team\nis drawn from all the college's in the University\nincluding IC, whereas IC is just drawn from one\ncollege).\nThis year, for the first time ever, it may be possible\nto raise a ladies team, as well as the existing mixed\nteam. If anyone is interested in either team then please\ncontact the Sailing Club at one of its meetings (see\nWhat's On) or via the Club pigeonholes in the Union.\nThe more the merrier!\nBoardsailing\nLast weekend the Boardsailing Club went down to\nGosport in search of sun, surf and wind. Although not\nvery sunny, force 7-8 winds meant our first stop was\nto buy a small enough sail and we then had some great\nsailing for the whole weekend.\nOur next trip will be to Poole/Bournemouth on 4\nNovember and we go to Queen Mary Reservoir every\nRunning\nThe first men's team did IC proud last Wednesday,\nby winning the first London College's League race of\nthe series. Despite missing some of our more valuable\nrunners on the day, the team packed well to\naccumulate 391 points, just 2 ahead of Thames Poly.\nAn outstanding 5th place was achieved by Paul\nNorthrop in his first race for the College and not far\nbehind was Alex Gaskell (17th). Helen Macintosh\nfinished 12th in the ladies race to become the first UL\nrunner home. With Sonia Legg in 20th, they managed\n8th in the team event.\nThe band wag gon rolls on at Guildford on November\n8. The Cross Country Club is set for a successful\nseason.\nWednesday, so whether you want to perfect your\none-handed duck jibes, or just like dressing up in day-g lo rubber, whether you fall off, or wipe out come and\nsee us in Southside Lounge at 12.30pm on Tuesday,\nwe cater for all standards from complete beginners\nto complete head cases.\nThe Wall\nThis coming Thursday Filmsoc is showing The WallMan Parker's film set to the music of the Pink Floyd\nalbum of the same name.\nIt is a dark, visceral work: a fading rockstar (played\nby Bob Geldof), on the verge of a nervous breakdown,\nlooks back on his life which has been traumatic to say\nthe least. The film is, perhaps, most memorable for\nits use of the distinctive cartoons of Gerald Scarfe,\nwhich fill the screen with disturbing, surreal images.\nAll in all, not a nice film but certainly a remarkable and\nmemorable one, guaranteed to leave you\n'uncomfortably numb'.\nSee What's On for further details.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS\nCOMMITTEE\nELECTIONS\nTuesday 31st October 1989,12.45pm Room 311\nHuxley Building, Dept of Computing\n1.

    "content": "Teaching is without doubt a very rewarding career.\nTeaching\nThere was a time when teaching was regarded by\nsome as a soft option-a last resort for the graduate\nif all else failed. This is no longer the case; the\nprofession faces greater challenges today than at any\ntime in its history and graduates would be well advised\nto consider carefully the evolutionary processes which\nare combining to make teaching one of the most\nstressful occ up a tons today.\nBefore considering the financial rewards, short days\nand long holidays it may be advisable to think of the\nhigh proportion of teachers who retire early on the\ngrounds of ill health of mental breakdown.\nWhat is happening in the world of education to\nproduce such serious problems? One of the most\ncontentious issues is discipline in the classroom. It is\nnot simply a question of the much publicised violence\nor the abolition of corporal punishment; laudable\nthough it was, it was simply the first step in a series\nof legal moves which have reduced the sanctions\navailable to teachers to an alarming extent.\nDiscipline in today's classrooms can only be\nmaintained by a process of negotiation between the\nteacher and pupil, but not all parents or pupils are\nprepared to enter into that process.\nThe status of teachers in today's society is\nconstantly called into question. Words such as\naccountability and assessment are bandied around\nwith little or no understanding of the problems they\ncreate. Mr Baker has stated that teachers should be\nassessed annually\u2014a simple enough idea, but by\nwhom and on what grounds? The learning and\nteaching processes are subjective; they cannot be\nquantified or measured empirically. There is also the\nproblem of the objectivity of the proposed\nassessment.\nThe encroachment of information technology into\nthe classroom is another factor which is claiming a lot of firsts for some teachers. The range of skills and\nknowledge required to handle the new technology\nexpands daily and teachers are expected to keep\nabreast of these developments. Through the advisory\nservices local education authorities do provide courses\nto enable teachers to gain new skills or expert ese, but\nthe knowledge base is cont ant ly shifting and\nexpanding.\nThe stresses involved in these developments\ncoupled with additional work of the changing\nsyllabuses and examination requirements have\nincreased the workload of the teacher to an extent\nwhich could not be for seen20 years ago. As a direct\nconsequence the teacher finds himself operating in a strained environment which is foreign to the one he\nenvisaged when he elected to enter the profession.\nThe Government's latest package of proposals\nindicate the rate of change is not going to slacken.\nThe advent of the City Technical Colleges (CTCs) in\ntheir areas will create even greater pressures on the\nteacher. Already schools are beginning to compete\nwith each other. There is a perceived need to be\njudged as being a 'good' or 'successful' school and\nthe obvious criteria for comparison is examination\nresults. If the 'better educated parents' of pupils who\ncurrently attend secondary schools with good\ncatchment areas send their children to the local CTC\nthe school's success rate in examinations will fall off.\nWill the school then be judged as a failure?\nThere will certainly be an increase in the pressure\nbrought to bear on teachers to maintain past levels\nof achievement. As we move into an era when\nschools will be responsible for their own financial\nadministration, and the funding is dependent on the\nnumber of pupils attending each schools parental\nchoice will become a vital consideration in the success\nor otherwise of any school. The prospects for some\nschools looks very bleak indeed.\nIn the light of these and other developments\ncurrently under consideration, it will behold the\ngraduate well to think very carefully before\ncommitting him or herself to a career in teaching. It\nis without doubt a very rewarding career, if one is\nsuccessful, but it is also extremely demanding. In the\nold days it was said that 'those who can do, do-those who can't, teach'. Perhaps it should be\nrephrased 'those who can teach, teach and those who\ncan't should keep well away'.\nUNITED ENGINEERING STEELS LTD.\nWe are Europe's largest\nmanufacturer of engineering steels\nand forging s.

    "content": "Chris Stapleton discovers how an experienced cycling bum doesn't get sore when riding a horse with the riding club\nWhip crack away!\nChaaaaarrgge! into the valley of Woking rode\nthe galli ant five hundred.\nUnless your steed's hind quarters are embellished\nwith a learner's'L' from Hell you probably won't reach\nsuch a climax on your first day's horse riding. But, the\ninitial zip of adrenal in ain't too bad at all partners when\nfirst you take that high stride into the saddle.\nDuke's classic tan shades conjured up visions of\ncowboys resting by the camp fire, harmonica playing,\nafter a long day's cattle driving in the heat of the day,\nriding free from today's toxic air across the plains, and\nother romantic imagery. So I got Cloud, a dark horse,\nhinting more of thunder and rain (definitely no lightning\nhere) rather than Wordsworth.\nHis steady manner on first approach belied the\nenormous and obviously unfulfilled stomach slung\nbetween his haunches. As soon as the reins were in\nmy hands his head dipped and kept on dipping, like\none of those sordid nodding glass ornamental birds.\nWhen the straw around his immediate vicinity had\nbeen consumed his attentions turned to the bale store\nin front of us: a brief but successful power struggle\nensued (I won).\nMoving out of the stables we were led by the more\nexperienced riders to the paddock to begin the day's lesson. Firstly, are we sitting comfortably, or at least\nare we sitting correctly. Sit back and upright, resisting\nthe temptation to grip, with nervous exasperation, the\nsaddle with the inner leg and thigh. Now make a line\nbetween the shoulder, hip, and ankle, and we're ready\nfor the off. Oh, but before the off it's quite a good\nidea to take a hold of the reins, thumbs up of course\nand untwisted from the bit.\nAnd they're off, racing down the inside left of the\npaddock at an incredible walking pace, firmly kicking\nthe belly with the heels in quick succession to keep\nhim going. Oh my god, the railings go round to the\nleft...what now? Pulling in on the left hand rein and\nkeeping taught on the right, while emphasising the\nkicking of the right leg, but retaining the action of the\nleft, isn't easy. But if you wish to avoid gouging your\nright leg it's the only way. You skid, in dramatic style,\naround the corner, leg and horse intact to see another\nday and another turn. A little ham my perhaps? Yes.\nNow, just to get your circulation going, a little keep\nfit. Whilst sitting, and keeping the horse moving, lean\nforward from the hips to touch the horse's ears. No\nproblem if you're on a Dartmoor pony. Then, leaning\nback, touch the tail. Now touch your left toe with your\nleft hand and vice-versa, and because that's far too\neasy try the left hand with your right toe and so on.\nCatching on eh, bit of a smart arse eh? Time for a bit of trotting then. Step One: liven the walking pace.\nStep Two: using a more persistent kicking action goad\non the horse with encouraging sounds. Step Three:\nremain upright and on top of the situation. Mastered\nthat. Good, let's go on to do some more of those\naerobics.\nIn drawing to the end of the first lesson I hear you\ncry 'Rawhide!'. Well I must admit that it was well\nknacker ing trying to keep up the kicking action,\nbiasing left or right as need be, but as far as\ndishevelled, blunt and bruised bums go, not one sore\ncheek in sight. Years of cycling over the potholes of\nLondon and the trip in the minibus on hard slat bench\nseats prepared me well for that potential ordeal. So\nif you fancy a trek and have not done it before, don't get bucked before the outset, go along and give it a try-Riding Club meets every Tuesday lunchtime, 12.30,\nSouthside Upper Lounge.\nChris Stapleton\n.

    "content": "Crossroads\nTracy Chapman\u2014Crossroads\nWith one platinum LP under her belt, Tracy Chapman\nhas reassembled the same team, including Larry Klein\n(husband of the Queen of singer-songwriters, Joni\nMitchell) in an attempt to repeat the success.\nUnfortunately she has fallen prey to the same problem\nencountered by her immediate predecessor, Suzanne\nVega, and remade her debut album.\nTracy Chapman was a near perfect collection of the\nbest of the songs written whilst busking in The\nVillage, New York. Fifteen months after the Nelson\nMandela Birthday Concert propelled her to fame, and\nwith the Amnesty tour under her belt it seems that\nten new songs of the same cal libre are at this time,\nbeyond her.\nThe subjects on Crossroads are much the same.\nPersonal experiences and social comment from a coloured point of view. The title track rails against the\npressure she obviously feels at being instant public\nproperty.\n7 look to the left, I look to the right,\nThere're hands that grab me on every side.'\nThis sentiment is repeated in Born to Fight where she\nprotests at being made into 'a white man's drone' an\nunderstandable fear because of the massive white\naudience that has put her where she now is.\nElsewhere, the oldest 'terrorist' of them all, Nelson\nMadela is the subject of Freedom Now, but the song\nis as tired as the continued calls for his release.\nIt is not until the penultimate track with This Time,\nthat Crossroads achieves the standards that Chapman\nhas set herself and Neil Young helps her to maintain\nthis for the finale, All That You Have Is Your Soul.\nHowever most of the songs are at best imitations of\nher earlier material and occasionally meld into\nblandness; the talent is obviously still present.\nHowever she must channel it into a specific direction\notherwise she will drift into obscurity with the\nswiftness she achieved stardom initially.\nR.P.O. Plays Floyd\nOK, so while it wasn't the cheapest of concerts, the\nLeave Those Kids Alone bash was in aid of the NSPCC\n(warm glow of self righteousness). For this princely\nsum you were awarded the Royal Philharmonic (less\nconductor, and several session musicians, all playing\nthe music of Pink Floyd. And you had comfy seats.\n'Less conductor?' I hear you ask. Well, not exactly.\nThe conductor was in fact David Palmer oi Jethro Tull\n'fame'.\nBefore the interval we were exposed to various\nGenesis and Jethro Tull tunes. By this point it was\nblatantly obvious that nobody had told Palmer what\na conductor does. To say that his leadership was\nuncoordinated would be a mild understatement\ncomparable to saying that Kenneth Baker is unpopular\nwith students. Of course the problem was that I had\nnever realised that Follow You, Follow Me was in 1:4\ntime!\nThen the real music began. However, no sooner had\nthe heartbeat recording on Run Like Hell began, with\nPalmer waving his thunderbird-like arms in the air,\nWrong Means\nthan disaster struck! The backing tape had a cardiac\narrest while he had trotted off to his dressing room\nto get his score for the second half. He returned\nsuitably armed with an impressive wad of rainforest\nand we were off.\nRPO went into autopilot mode,\nThe 'rock' musicians went into loud mode,\nPalmer went into Kermit the Frog mode.\nSo what was the outcome of all this frenzied\nactivity? Well, while Another Brick in the Wall Part I was suffering from poor arrangement, Part II and\nShine On Your Crazy Diamond were excellent. The\nremainder was, to put it politely, mediocre.\nTwo very drawn out encores later (between which\nmany people mistakenly left) we filed out. Among us\nwere the dedicated followers along with those on the\ncharity evening circuit who had barely even heard of\nthe group and weren't impressed.\nAn evening not to be missed? No; even for the most\nhardened fan this didn't do justice to Pink Floyd.\nNo Means No\u2014Wrong\n'AND YOU CAN DANCE!' This is excellent. No Means\nNo have come a long way since their promising but\nsparse debut Sex Mad. The Day Everything Became\nNothing was a good follow up, but now they seem\nto have reached their destination.\nEvery available space is a churning mix of bass and\ndrums similar to Punchline and Minutemen (even my\nstomach started turning, or maybe that was last\nnight's pints of Directors). If you haven't heard this\nlot before their closest contemporaries are labelmates\nLard or possibly Victims of Family. No Means No\nPage 6\nhowever, take a more head down approach, building\nsongs around complicated rhythm changes\npunctuated with slabs of harsh Gang of Four type\nguitars (okay I'm not scared to use ac liche now and\nthen!).\nIf your room mate likes Queen buy him this because\nhe'll hate every second. Even better, get him to buy\nit for you. This means you can play it until he stage\ndives out of the window thus killing two birds with\none stone.\nDick Savage.\nJoe Jackson\nHalfway through Saturday night's concert Joe\nJackson effectively silenced those hecklers shouting\nrequests for old numbers with 'I 've got a request for\nyou too...'. His ability to hit the target was in this case\ngood-natured but is an accurate description of much\nof his music and 'angry' label he acquired has not been\neasy to shift. This is hardly surprising when he plays\nsongs like Jet Set ('Fat American tourists pointing\ncameras at you') and Evil Empire ('A few cheap shots\nat Reagan') with such vehemence.\nHe has no pretensions as a slick rock star, and\nobviously enjoys playing with all of his ten-strong\nAnglo-American band. What is lost by the lack of\nstage show is more than made up for by his reworking\nof old favourites. Hometown was set to Pachabel's Canon (the pure wool advert for philistines who don't know), and there was an instrumental vers on of\nBreaking Us In Two. This was obviously too close for\ncomfort for one couple who walked out screaming at\neach other at this point.\nThe main theme of the evening was his latest album\nBlaze of Glory, which was played in its entirety.\nAlmost a concept album, which Jackson admits to\nhating, it traces the developments for his attitudes\nsince the sixties. From the naive dreams of\nTomorrow's World to the present day desires to be\nNineteen Forever, and intended swipe at the\nrenaissance of certain 'old lizards and deaf guitarists'.\nPlayed almost as recorded it provided many\nopportunities for the audience to 'stomp in their seats'\nbut it wasn't until his final encore of the Jumpin' Jive\nmedley that everyone deigned to stand up and get\ndown. Presumably lost on them was the immortal line\nwhich should be included in the IC crest; 'What's the\nuse of getting sober, when you're gonna get drunk\nagain!'.\nVeiled\nClaytown Troupe Through the Veil\nDebut album from the band that will 'redefine the\nformula for commercial rock of the 1990's'. If you\nthink the level of reviewing in FELIX sometimes verges\non the sycophantic you should see some of the guff\nwe get from the record companies.\nFirst heard whilst watching Bros In 2 Summer on\nTV (lovely boys those Goss twins, shame about Ken),\nnearly half of Through the Veil sounded reminiscent\nof Julian Cope a la Teardrop Explodes with the guitars\nwound up. It was of course a vast improvement on\nthe sound of 50,000 pubescent gir lies screaming at\nMatt's nipples, yet still throwaway and forgettable.\nSecond time around it was better (no sexy young\ngods to des tract me). Too much emphasis on the\nnoisy rockers. However, this is the material of fine live\nperformances, with flashes of originality from Rick\nWilliams' understated keyboards and 'Ben' Bennet's guitar, especially on Haf fo Haf and the single Prayer\n. Later on in side two there is a complete\ntransformation with Love Is and The Veil, a brace of\nsnappy intelligent songs of the sort REM produced\nbefore they became 'the greatest band in the world'.\nThere is also an ethereal ac cou stic guitar instrumental\ncalled Chiracahua Sun. This is out of place but entirely\nwelcome on an album which shows promise but will\nnot be changing Rock as we know it for a little while\nyet, thank you.\nA free 12\" EP accompanying the album gives\nsuperior mixes of Bury My Heart and Prayer indicating\nthat producer Ron Fair played no small part in the\nmaking of this album.\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX Thanks\nI have to start this editorial with a huge thanks to\neverybody in the FELIX Office this week. Andy\nThompson, our printer has been an absolute marvel,\nworking far beyond the call of duty. I cannot begin\nto express how thankful I am to Andy Bannister, who\nstopped me thinking this issue would never come out\nand helped print FELIX until 4am on Thursday\nmorning. Steve Meyfroidt has pasted up more than\nI believed was possible and Stef Smith has done a fantastic job running the paper whilst I was at the\nCommemoration ceremony; I am immensely grateful\nto both of them.\nLife Science\nI must apologise most profusely for my hj deo us slur\nupon the Life Sciences Derision as I must now call it.\nDue to an horrendous typing error, the words\n'Wednesday afternoon,' were mixed up with the\nwords 'Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes between\n12.30 and 2.30.' I cannot see how this most hideous\ncrime was perpetrated but, rest assured, when I find-the gremlins responsible I shall have them summarily\nshot. I believe the department in question has now\ncorrected its error in timetabling within these areas,\nwhich breaks the rules set down by the College's Board of Studies. It's good to know that it isn't just\nmyself who makes mistakes.\nWhilst I am on the subject of Board of Studies, it\nis interesting to note how the College handles external\nexaminers' reports. Departments are reviewed by\nexternal examiners for the Universities Funding\nCouncil every five years or so. The results from their\nefforts should make objective criticisms within the\nconstraints of the brief time of contact that external\nexaminers enjoy. They would make interesting\nreading. How sad then, that they are confidential. The\nonly point at which Board of Studies gets to see these\nreports is after they have been through a meeting of\nthe College's Undergraduate Studies Committee. This\nCommittee has a body of academics, who far\noutweigh the students present. Now here is the\nshocker; the department under review gets to send\ntwo representatives to this censoring committee. Yes,\nat Imperial College you can judge yourself and adjust\nother people's views accordingly. Doubleplus good for\nthe Ministry of Truth.\nCommemoration day\nApart from a two second high point, this had to be one\nof the most boring low points of my life so far. It was\nmade all the worse by the sheer bumbling idiocy of\nthe Dean of the Royal College of Science, Professor\nJames Barber. This man managed to verbally mangle\nalmost every name he read from the list of graduates,\nincluding simple ones like 'Clark.' Was he drunk or did\nhe just not bother reading through the list beforehand?\nNeedless to say, the Deans of each of the other\nColleges gave a most commendable reading. The only\nthing which saved the whole occasion, however, was\nthe excellent speech by John Smith; it is sad we will\nnot see him as staff orator next year.\nHealth Centre\nI should like to point out now that I Will not print letters\nwhich are or may be professionally damaging to any\nmember of the medical profession. I do not wish to\nsee a trial of doctors through the pages of FELIX. If\nyou wish to complain about any doctor you should\nwrite to your local Family Practitioners Council (FPC).\nThe local address is Kensington, Chelsea and\nWestminster FPC, Grove House, 88-94 Westbourne\nGrove, London W2.\nCompetition\nOn a lighter note, I have been accused of catching out\nthe College's staff in alphabetical order. This is entirely\nuntrue. Just to prove my conviction on this point, I shall offer a \u00a35 prize to the sender of the best bit of\ndirt on a well known member of College, whose\nsurname begins with the letter 'D'. You can post the\nmuck in the messages file on the door of the FELIX\nOffice if you wish to remain anonymous before the\na noun cement of the prize winning entry. If anybody\nwould like to have their own cock-ups highlighted in\nFELIX, and would like to plan them ahead, the letter\nfor the week after will be 'E.'

    "content": "Hats off to the Blue Nile\ninfectious choruses that you will not even notice at\nfirst la tradition in Blue Nile songs) until you are found\nsinging it every minute of the day. The second side,\nhowever, is saved solely by the haunting melody of\nFrom a Late Night Train, probably the best track on\nthe album.\nAnd so, 1989 will be remembered only for the ear\nbashing, stomach turning dross that is Stock, Aitken\nBlue Nile-Hats\nIt had to be a disappointment didn't it?\nFor five years now, Blue Nile devotees have been\nreligiously scouring the music press for any little\nsnip pit that might indicate the arrival of the 'difficult'\nsecond album.\nHow could anybody follow the intensely brilliant\nWalk Across the Rooftops? Maybe nobody can.\nCertainly the Blue Nile seem quite uncomfortable\nperched upon the ped as tal on which their follower's have placed them, for, although Hafs is not far\nremoved from their first offering, it falls down on three\naccounts:-Firstly; what has happened to the noises? The\nbones, the chains, the steel, the atmosphere that was\nRooftops, each sound a delicious sub-plot that made\nthe en tir it y of songs such as Easter Parade and\nAutomobile Noise.\nSecondly; the lyrics. Paul Buchanan has the ability\nto write songs about places where we have all been,\nthe places where we lost lor found) our first love,\nthose intimate places that will always remain\nsomewhere deep inside us. And yet on Hafs he\nstruggles to capture our hearts. The words almost\nwant to make us cry and, although nobody can doubt\nthe sincerity with which they are sung, they somehow\nfail to transform us back to those mystic times and\nwe remain seated, dry of eye, within the four walls\nof our present surroundings.\nAnd thirdly; has Paul's voice left its 'Sinatra-ist'\nleanings and headed towards the ground which Chris\nRea already occupies? A sad departure.\nHowever, before becoming too despondent Hafs is\na good album. The three songs on the first side\nincluding the excellent Downtown Lights all have their\npassionate moments, especially on lef's Go Out\nTonight. Whilst Over the Hillside has one of those\nNaked and Bland\nCindy Lee Berryhill\u2014Naked Movie Star\nand Waterman, our few moments of relief having been\nsupplied by Costello and Collins (Edwyn, not Phil).\nWhilst Hafs is a good album and undoubtedly\nworthy of a prime place in anybody's record collection\nit is not the second coming which the faithful will have\nprayed for.\nIt had to be a disappointment, didn't it!\nAndy (A Blue Nile devotee).\nLittle cuddly fluffy bunny popped his head out into the\nbright morning sunshine. He blinked as the warm\nsummer breeze played across his fur. His little pink\nnose twitched with pleasure as the gentle wind\nbrought the fresh smell of happiness to his burrow.\nBBLLLLEEEUUUGHHH! THUD! EEEOOOWWW! A surging tidal wave of guitar and drums tears the still\ntwitching ears from the twisting body! Oops! Sorry\nthat's the No Means No LP again.\nHaving never actually heard of Cindy before (cries\nof; oh! No! you mean you haven't got the 'Grandma's Blueberry Pie American Dream' import compilation\ncollecting the best of her 17 classic LPs), I was rather\nexpecting some dreary SAW type girly girl wimp e ring over a drum machine about her 12 year-old boyfriend.\nIn fact the first track was a quite promising blend of\nblues and jazz with a groovy Hammond organ backing\na Neil Young type vocal (that's promising?). However,\nso were all the other tracks. Cindy obviously holds to\nthe Tracy Chapman ethic of diversity.\nThis record is just a bit too bland, giving the\nimpression it would sound damn good in a wine bar\nbut is too emotion less for home consumption. Too\nmuch Greenwich Village and brown rice, without the\nreal talent the t will make sure Michelle Shocked\nremains the Queen of the Arran Sweater Brigade\n(cheques in the post, I hope Michelle!).\nDick Savage.\nMonstrous Puppets\nMeat Puppets\u2014Monsters\nIn this review the Meat Puppets (probably the Pups\nto their friends, if they have any anymore) get what\nthey deserve for bowing before the corporate gods of\nAmerican FM radio. Yes kids that's right, the cuddly\nKirkwood brothers prove that living in the desert and\ndrinking nothing but JB really can cause you to like\nTofo.\nOur good friends The Meats latest LP is a true\nmonster indeed. The hardcore approach of In A Car\nand the often brilliant Up on the Sun are in little\nevidence here. I thought this band were definitely past\ntheir sell-by date when I heard Mirage. I guess\neverybody knew they were sun baked hippy s then and\nthis LP proves it! One thing you can say for the Meat\nPuppets is they've always been prolific in their LP\noutput. I wish they bloody well weren't.I could go into an in-depth critique of every track\nbut that would be as boring as the record itself. Save\nyour money readers, go and buy Up on the Sun if you\nwant a good record. If you want a brilliant one buy\na Firehose LP instead (cheques in the post, I hope\nlads!).\nDick Savage.\nTar Heads\nMore Fiends\u2014Yo Asphalt Head\nWOOARGH!! Yo Asphalt Head is loud, dangerous,\nnoisy, furious, insistent, pounding hardcore by a four-piece from wild west Philly. This new album by the\nMean Fiends from Philadelphia in America is rather\nloud and lacks musical refinements such as melody\nand tunes.\nBleargh!! Bob Bludgeon, ferocious new sticks man joins Allen, Elizabeth and Ron Fiend to bring you a disc\nfull of verve and energy; a rapid-fire concentrated\ndelivery!! The drummer is called Robert. The new\nalbum has some original songs with imaginative titles\nsuch as Vinyl Grind, Slug Cooked, Mad at Everyone\nand Time-Warp Bio-feedback Amphetamine\nNightmare. I kid you not.\nAaagh!! Danger's always dogg in' these dudes,\nwork in' as bike couriers dodgin' head on collisions.\nSo far they've come out of it unscathed but Al's riffs\nwill knock your jaded ears off and the bass line can\nslush your brain around inside your skull. As\nmentioned earlier, the 'music' is rather loud and\noffensive to the ears.\nUuuunngh! Bad luck lives next door to the Fiends,\nand the grim reaper across the street. Once some\ndude broke his neck slam min' at a gig and another\ntime someone freaked out with a butcher's knife and\nkilled a customer. This is music to break your neck\nto, or perhaps commit murder.\n'Nuff said!\nC.D. L. Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Careers Fair\nWhether you have your future mapped out in front of you or\nwhether you still don't know what you want to do when you\ngrow up, the Careers Fair has something for you. There is a vast array of opportunities in accountancy, banking and\nmanagement consultancy. Then there's always the army...\nMaking the most of the Fair\nThe Imperial College Careers Fair is tailor-made to help\nyou find out about employers before you decide which\nof them will be lucky enough to get an application\nfrom you! Your time at Imperial will probably have\nconvinced you that you're one of an elite group of\nstudents whom employers are falling over each other\nto recruit. There is some truth in this, but I have to\ntell you that we're not yet at the stage where you can\njust sit back and wait for them to discover you. You\nstill have to do something about it and going to the\nfair is one of the best things you can do to get the\nball rolling.\nThe employers at the Fair will be able to tell you\nabout themselves, the jobs they want to fill and the\nsort of people they are looking for. They will also be\non the lookout for potential applicants so the Fair can\nprovide you with an opportunity to impress a particular\nemployer you already have your eye on. You may even\nbe interviewed at some later date by the person you\ntalk to at the Fair. In this case a little preparation\nbeforehand could mean the difference between\ncreating a lasting impression and being lost in a sea\nof faces.\nPreparing for the Fair\n'Wait a minute!' I can hear some of you saying. '\nI thought the Fair was to help me obtain information.\nYou make it sound as if I'm going to be interviewed!'\nThe answer is, of course, that both could be true on\nthe day-it really depends on where you have got to\nin your thinking about your future. Perhaps you fit into\none of the following categories:\nI haven't really got a clue what to do\u2014let alone\nwho I should talk to at the Fair!\nDepending on how much time you've got when you\nrealise this-there are a number of things you could\ndo. A careers interview perhaps, a stab at a computer-assisted career guidance programme possibly, a look\nthrough some self-help workbooks to help you focus\non your interests, skills etc before matching these to\nsuitable careers-any of these might help you. The\nCollege Careers Advisory Service will tell you about\nthe range of things we provide to help you get started.\nI don't know what I want to do and what's more\nI haven't got time before the fair to find out!\nFirst list on a piece of paper the things you are good\nat. Some of these might appear quite ordinary-an\nability to listen, talk, argue, negotiate or make\nspeeches. Others may relate more directly to your\ndegree subject, eg analysis, numeracy, lucid writing,\npractical ability, programming and so on. Then stop\nto think which of these you would particularly like to\nuse in a job (if any!). You could then approach an\nemployer at the Fair and say something like 'I believe\nmy skills lie in these areas-do you think you would\nhave anything to suit me?' You could also look at your\nPage 12\ninterests. How do you currently feel about your degree\nsubject-love it, can't stand it etc? What about your\nspare time interests-do you like committee meetings,\nteam activities, outdoor pursuits and so on? These\nmay also help you to identify particular employers at\nthe Fair. You might also like to think about what is\nimportant to you. Do you want to earn a fortune in\nyour first year of employment, do you want to live and\nwork in Scotland, do you fancy doing something that\nmight eventually lead to self-employment?\nHaving been through this exercise you should at\nleast have a better idea of what sort of person you\nare and this may provide clues about which employers\nyou might approach at the Fair.\nI know roughly the sort of work I want to do but\nI'm not sure who offers it.\nThe Fair is, of course, one way to find out and\nemployers will be on the lookout for floating voters l However, you could seize the opportunity to provide\na better impression if you spent some time researching\nparticular employers before the Fair. You could, for\nexample, look up who employs graduates from your\ndegree discipline in a careers directory such as ROGET\nor GET. With an immediate hit-list of possible\nemployers which you could cross check with those\nat the Fair, you can then begin to focus upon specific\nemployers. A browse through their brochure in the\nCareers Office should help you to decide whether\nwhat they offer is what you really want. It is probably\nbest not to be too choosy at this stage, however, but\nrather to use the Fair to ask employers to clarify any\nmisconceptions, fears etc you may have. You may\nend up rejecting them after all but at least it will be\nfor sound reasons. If on the other hand you have\nidentified an employer who seems right for you-then\nyou should use the Fair to create a memorable impact\non them. This will involve stating the reasons for your\ninterest in them and leaving them with the impression\nthat you will be applying to them and hope very much\nto have the opportunity to discuss your application\nthrough a more formal interview.\nWhat should I do after the Fair?\nThe Fair will, hopefully, have helped you identify some\nemployers you would like to apply to. It is worth\nmaking a note of these soon after the Fair in case a couple of weeks of intensive lectures clouds your\nmemory! Before you actually complete an application\nform, you should read through any literature about\nthat employer which you have managed to obtain.\nThis will act as a last check that you really do want\nto apply to them before you invest a lot of time in\npursuing your application.\nApplications\nApplying for jobs is easy. Applying effectively for a job that will suit your qualifications, experience and\npersonality demands skill and, very often, imagination.\nHow does the system work? Let's start with the\nperson who initiates your application-the employer.\nBefore a job can be advertised, this person needs to\nknow what the new recruit will be expected to do.\nA list of regular tasks and responsibilities will be drawn\nup. This is the 'job description'. Similarly, before\nshort listing the candidates from the forms and CVs\nthat arrive, the employer will develop a 'person\nspecification'. This is a checklist of key factors that\nwill be either essential or desirable if a candidate is\ngoing to be able to cope, generally after initial training,\nwith the demands of the job, as described in the job\ndescription. The person specification may look\nsomething like this: 'A suitable candidate will be\nnumerate leg at least Grade B at '0' Level) with\nproven organisational skills. He/she should be\npractical, not afraid to communicate effectively both\nverbally and in writing and be seriously motivated\ntowards developing a management career'.\nYou, as the applicant, can apply the same technique\nto tune into the employer's wavelength. The easy\nmethod of applying for jobs is to give detailed\ninformation about yourself and your activities in a haphazard fashion, with the attitude that 'anything\nthat looks interesting' will do. Not only is this time\nconsuming, it is often wasted effort. The difficult bit\nis judging what the important elements of the person\nspecification are, and then emphasising your aptitude\nfor the advertised position by highlighting your\nrelevant experience. How do you do this? Put yourself\nin the employer's position. Draw up a job description\nusing the advert, Careers Information Booklets,\nROGET, the Trade Press and obviously the company\nrecruitment brochure, if it exists, and then write a person specification. Say to yourself 'What have I ever\ndone to show that I fit in with this person\nspecification? Can I organise things and people? How\ndo I persuade them that I have practical skills?' etc.\nHighlight all these factors in your application and\nconsiderably reduce all other information.\nThe aim of the exercise is for the employer upon\nreceiving your application to think, 'This person has\nreally thought about what we're looking for' and put\nyou on the short list for interview.\nFinally\nBoth the College's Careers Advisory Service and the\nImperial College Union Industrial Society provide a range of resources you can use to help you decide on\nyour future career. You could visit an employer,\nparticipate in a business game, watch a video, attend\ncareers talks, go for mock interviews and so on. The\nCareers Advisory Service will be represented at the\nFair and will be happy to provide you with detailed\nprogrammes of their activities.\nRuss Clark\nHead of College\nCareers Service\n\n"

He also admitted that it was\neasier to raise money on the 'emotional aspects of\nmedicine, not on the \"bricks and mortar'\", and much\nof the appeal is to go towards a new 'Centre for Visual\nScience' and a 'Centre for Biological and Medical\nSystems'. The Centre for Visual Science is to be split\nbetween the clinical aspect, set in the Western\nOpthalmic Hospital (connected to St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School) and the bio physical aspect, this side\nof the park.\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, commented on the\nmerger that he thought it only a 'natural complement'.\nHe also complained that 'Universities are asking to\nreconstruct without gaining any funds by doing\nso...this appeal is quite modest in comparison to\nOxbridge standards' and that Imperial College were\nth rid in the league table, marginally under Oxford and\nCambridge, but doesn't get the funding to complement\nthis position.\nThe Dean of St Mary's Hospital Medical School,\nProfessor Peter Richards explained that the appeal\nwas 'about education, about research and finally about\nthe care of patients...we are in the business of\nthro roughly raising the intelligence of students....so\nI have not the slightest Compunction in asking for \u00a37\nmillion'.

    "content": "We're all\nwonderful\nDear Mr Smedley,\nWe write with regard to your comments in last\nweek's FELIX concerning Life Sciences timetabling,\nand would be interested to know from where you have\nobtained your information. All students were given an\noutline timetable at the beginning of term, which\ninformed them at least where and when to go for their\nfirst lecture, and they were given detailed timetables\nat the beginning of their course. We have copies of\nthese timetables and none indicates any classes on\nWednesday afternoons. We have checked with the\ncourse convener s concerned, who have confirmed\nthat there has been no teaching on Wednesday\nafternoons on their courses. In addition, we have\nspoken to a number of students, none of whom have\nbeen affected, or know anybody who has been\naffected by timetabled work during Wednesday\nafternoons, or by lack of information on where or\nwhen their lectures are. We have also seen the\nDivisional Rep, AN Mobasheri, and he has confirmed\nthat he knows of no problems.\nI am sure that all Life Sciences students know us\nin the office well enough to inform us if there are any\nserious complaints.\nFor the record, we would like to point out that\nProfessor Anderson is in no way responsible for any\ntimetabling within the Division.\nYours sincerely,\nValerie Forge and Debbie Lloyd, Life Science Office.\nLife sciences\nderision\nDear Dave,\nWe were very surprised at the tone and factual\ncontents of your editorial on the Life Science\nDepartment in last week's issue of FELIX (No 8451.\nWe would firstly point out that Life Sciences is a Division and not a Department, and there are two\nDepartments concerned. We represent the\nDepartment of Biology, so what we have to say\napplies mainly to our department. We have checked\nand could find no instance of any teaching taking\nplace on Wednesday afternoons. All teaching takes\nplace as outlined on the detailed timetable of every\ncourse, provided to each student on the first day of\nthe course. If and when any change is made, this is\ndone following full consultation with the students. We\nwill take your claim seriously if you can at least tell\nus which courses and lecturers were supposedly\ninvolved.\nWe would admit to a complicated timetable, but\nthat stems from our problem in that Life Sciences does\nnot have adequate lecturing facilities, especially for\nthe large common First Year. Instead of writing as you\nhave done, it would be more helpful to your fellow\nstudents if you spent time campaigning for better\nlecturing facilities in the College.\nFinally, your unfounded personal comments that\nProf Anderson has little thought for the students in\nhis department and that he does not deign to speak\nto mere mortals cannot go unanswered. He does care\nabout undergraduate teaching and chairs the StaffPage 24\nStudent Committee, at which student reps from each\nyear comment on the courses and appropriate action\nis taken. Most of the students in the Life Sciences\nDivision will have met him, at our termly Staff-Student\nWine & Cheese functions. He not only 'deigns to\nspeak to mere mortals', he drinks with them!\nYours sincerely,\nDr Bill Hominick,\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies, Biology.\nDr Mustafa Djamgoz, Senior Tutor, Biology.\nResearch makes\nProf a Mr?\nDear FELIX Editor,\nYour 'footnote' (and I use the term lightly as it\nshould really be described as trash!) concerning the\npoor running of the Life Sciences Office has just come\nto my attention. Quite frankly I cannot imagine what\nwould prompt you to write such a blatantly inaccurate\neditorial. I would also like to ask why you have printed\nnone of the letters that you received, even with names\nwithheld, if this was not just a figment of your\nimagination? As far as I know there are NO colleges\nin the University of London that do have lectures on\na Wednesday afternoon, and certainly no life\nscientists I know! You obviously have not actually\nseen any of the timetables 1st year-3rd year, that\nare freely available and have been since the beginning\nof term. In case you don't know, it's called research!\nI can only assume that your criticism of Mr\nAnderson's management is equally un researched. I would equate this kind of jou nal is m with that of a Sunday Sport trainee journalist. What's in FELIX next\nweek? 'Rector uses IC's to buy spaceship'.\nI suggest that you also include an apology to the\nwhole of the Life Science Department and its very\nhelpful staff!\nYours sincerely,\nLJ Sawyerr, Biochem II.\nNothing to\ndiscuss\nDear Dave,\nThe concept of free university education, which has\nbeen built up over the last 35 years is under attack.\nThere are two prongs to this attack: The first is the\nproposal by Government no longer to maintain the\nvalue of the grant, against erosion by inflation,\ncoupled with the offer of loans to bridge the gap. The\nsecond is a proposal perpetrated by some Vice\nChancellors, that students should pay the full\neconomic costs of their studies in the form of fees,\ncompensated in part by means-tested State\nScholarships.\nWhen asked, on the phone, by one of your\ncolleagues, I said that I saw the latter as the greater\ndanger, the one which it is was important to counter.\nI also said that in my view, the retention of a full\nmaintenance grant is no longer a realistic hope. The\npriority of all political parties is to increase the\npercentage \u2022 of the community who benefit from\ntertiary education. I do not see any evidence of\npolitical will-on either side of Parliament-to maintain\nfull grants. It is important not to under estimate the\nfact that grant support barely exists in continental\nEurope, or, come to that, the USA.\nThe full fees movement is a desperate move by the\nproposer s which I believe to be wholly against the\ninterests of society in general and all of us in the\nuniversity system in particular. I participated in the\ndebate in the Committee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrinciples. I wrote an extended letter to the Times\nHigher Education Supplement attacking the full fees\nproposal. Did you see it Dave? The THES is after all\nquite an important forum for discussion of such\nmatters. My views are accessible to anyone who\nmight be interested to hear them. It is not difficult to\ncaricature by selective quotation-but Dave, it is not\ngood journalism; nor is it keeping faith with your\nreaders.\nWhy have we not called that committee? Because\nso far there has been almost nothing solid to discuss.\nIs it possible that the very small number of students\nwho attended the EGM on loans can be thus\nexplained?\nThe situation may change in the near future. There\nis a likelihood (no certainty) that the Loans issue will\nfigure in the Queen's speech. The full fees movement\nis a new dimension to the problem which I believe\nrequires more analysis; it is one where participation\nin debate could make a decisive difference. I will ask\nMr Edmund Dell the designated Chairperson, to\narrange a meeting of the committee before the end\nof the term.\nYours sincerely,\nEric A. Ash.\nBaron is\nbollocks!\nDear Dave,\nAfter reading the piece 'The Baron of Cheapskate'\nI have only one question, why?\nI presume that it was humourous parody but since\nI 've been at IC for three weeks I found it introspective,\nself-glorifying horse shit.\nThe only references I recognised as being instantly\nImperial College were, 'Jackie Skirt...citizen in charge\nof well feeling' and 'Fiona Nickerless'. An attitude\nwhich seems to be stuffed down the trouser fronts\nof some of the male population in College. If this sort\nof pap is to be valid then perhaps 'Neil Smug' should\nbe the three legged man and 'Derek Dash' a do-it-yourself enthusiast.\nFELIX is the paper for the Imperial College Union and\nnot an ego massage r for the Union Executive. If you\nare attempt img to alienate first year readers then; nice\none.\nGive the next instalment of 'The Baron of\nCheapskate' its rightful place in journalism\u2014in the bin.\nDominic Wilkinson.\nSmart arse shit\nwins\nDear FELIX,\nDespite being zealous enough to insert the word\n'loans' into every paragraph of FELIX No 846, your\nEditor still managed to perpetrate a disgusting spelling\nmistake in the main headline of page one.\nPerhaps this was his deliberate implicit comment on\nthe quality of his education. However, I think not.\nYours,\nF Dudbridge, Computing.\nNo, it was a test to see which obnoxious smart-arse d shit from Computing would wing e first.\n\n"

    "content": "Interviews\nBefore the interview, make sure that the clothes you\nare to wear are clean, smart and comfortable. Check\ndetails of the time and place of interview. Make sure\nyou know how to get there and allow plenty of time\nfor cancelled trains or broken down buses or cars.\nRead through your application form and imagine what\nsort of questions you would ask if presented with such\na form. Remind yourself why you want the job and\nwhy you think you'd be good at it. What's your\nevidence? Read any company literature you've got.\nRehearse the worst question you can imagine the\nemployer asking!\nThe first few minutes of an in te view are critical. The\nemployer will expect you to be a bit nervous (they're\nprobably a bit nervous too) but try to appear relaxed.\nTake your cues from the interviewer, if they offer a handshake, shake it firmly but not too firmly and wait\nto be asked to sit down. Throughout the interview,\ndo make eye contact with the interviewer. Candidates\nwho gaze at the floor or out of the window are rarely\nsuccessful. Speak clearly and remember the points\nyou wish to get over. If necessary, manipulate the\nquestions in order to get your points\nacross...something I am sure many of you have done\nin exams.\nEmployers will want to test how well you are suited\nto the job both in terms of ability and personality. They\nwill ask you questions about your leisure activities to\nSome of you may be looking on with great despair at\nyour friends wondering 'What's happening to them all\nof a sudden?' as they've begun to talk about starting\nsalaries, going to presentations, filling in application\nforms and worst of all, buying a suit. 'Have they sold\nout?' you ask.\nWell don't worry if you're not interested in getting\na job after you finish-there is an alternative. It is,\nwhat is commonly referred to as a 'YEAR OFF' \u2014\nsomething which is becoming increasingly popular\nwith graduates: It's worth considering even if you are\ngoing through the Milk Round this year, as more and\nmore employers are willing to consider deferred entry.\nThere are a number of reasons for taking a year off\nand it is important to find out if it will personally\nbenefit you; only you can decide that.\nPrincipally, a year off is a break from the academic\nsystem which many of you have been in for at least\nsixteen years. It is an option when you are unsure of\nwhat you want to do or feel that you don't want to\nstart a job straight away.\nA year off gives you the time and the opportunity\nto try something new or different: to travel round the\nworld; to live and work in another country; do\nvoluntary work or to do anything you want.\nAs long as you use the time constructively then it\nwill enhance your personal development and\ncharacter, as well as help you decide what interests\nyou, and therefore which career path you wish to\npursue.\nIf you decide to take a year out, then start thinking\nand planning now as to how you will spend the time,\nsee how well you can communicate but also to find\nevidence of your character and interests. Two very\ncommon types of questions are what I call the 'Expert'\nand the 'Idiot'. The 'Expert' question is where you\nknow a lot about the subject and the interviewer\nknows very little. This could be based on your project,\ndegree subject, a hobby, anything. Make sure you find\nout how much the interviewer knows and pitch your\nanswer accordingly. Don't blind them with\ngobbledygook but don't bore them with a 'ladybird\nguide' approach. The 'Idiot' question is where the\nroles are reversed. They know a lot about the subject\nand you know very little. They don't expect you to\nget the answer right, they just want to see if you\ntackle the question in logical, structured way. Don't be afraid to pause and marshal your thoughts before\nanswering any question. Better to have a few seconds\nsilence than for you to launch in, get halfway through\nan answer, change your mind, forget what you were\ngoing to say and end with a lame 'urn'.\nInterviewers will expect you to be keen and\ninterested. One way of showing this is to ask genuine\nquestions at the end of the interview. Make sure that\nyou also find out what happens next in the selection\nprocess and how long you will have to wait before you\nhear the outcome. Don't forget to thank the\ninterviewers for their time. Oh yes, and don't forget\nto smile.\nbecause it is very easy to fall into the trap of doing\na year of nothing. Use the Careers Service to get the\nnames of organisations involved in short-term projects\nand work schemes.\nFinally, employers will look upon a graduate who\nhas taken a year off favourably providing he/she has\nused the time effectively. Very often your new\npersonal attributes after a year off will give you the\nedge over other applicants.\nA word of warning-do not be fooled into thinking\nthat because you are taking a year off, then your\ndegree result does not matter. Although you are\nconstantly hearing that graduates are in big demand,\nit is very often misquoted. The demand is actually for\n'Good Graduates'. This implies a good degree;\ntherefore do not neglect your work.\nContacts\nCommunity Service Volunteers (CSV), 237\nPentonville Road N1 9NJ,012786601.

Published by CRAC-See Careers Office.\nDirectory of Jobs and Careers Abroad-by Leppard.\nD. Published by Vacation Work.\nWhat a WANGer\nCommerce and industry increasingly rely on\ncomputers. Computers control manufacturing\nprocesses. Computers analyse probabilities for\ninsurance. Everywhere computers control accounting,\ninvoicing and all layers of finance. Without computers\nthe City of London would grind to a halt and the\nwheels of industry would not turn.\nThe development and maintenance of these\ncommercial systems is done by an army of analysts\nand programmers. These 200,000 men and women\ntend not to be technical wizards. The skills required\nare more the ability to analyse business requirements\nand convert these into systems. The emphasis is upon\nthe application of technology to the real world, not\ntechnology for its own sake.\nThe commercial computing industry is desperately\nshort-staffed. At the lower levels, there are 47% more\nvacancies than people. This has driven salaries up to\nludicrous levels. Freelance analyst/programmers with\nthree to four years experience can demand a thousand\na week. Lowly programmers are getting \u00a316K after\ntwo years. The low levels of graduates coming into\nthe industry combined with the general unwillingness\nof companies to train means that this situation can\nonly get worse. (Or better!)\nWhat does the job entail? To start with, computer\nprogramming. Upon, joining a graduate is sure to be\ntaught a programming language and set to work upon\neither the development of a new system or, more\nlikely, the maintenance and enhancement of an\nexisting system. The language is unlikely to be one\nlearnt at College, COBOL is sadly prevalent although\nfourth generation languages are slowly gaining\npopularity. Work on maintenance can be extremely\nfrustrating, learning just how code should not be\nwritten.\nLater, the trainee starts analysis work. This is the\nmost challenging part of the job. An analyst has to\nunderstand quickly user procedures which they have\ndeveloped over a long period of time, and be able to\napply these to a systems environment. Analysis can\nlead to such wonderful (and lucrative) careers as\nconsultancy.\nThe industry is in a constant state of flux. This is\nnot a career for those wanting a stable job with one\ncompany for thirty years. The average time a programmer stays in a job is eighteen months. 49%\nwork for themselves, taking six to twelve month\ncontracts, then moving on. Large companies seem to\nbe having problems: Wang and Ferranti are in dire\nfinancial straits, IBM's profits are 30% down. Small\ncompanies rise to make millions, then crash\nspectacularly or are swallowed by the giants. Those\nwith a clear head and the intuition when to jump can\nmake a fortune.\nTo get a job you need nine month's commercial\nexperience. You cannot get nine month's commercial\nexperience without a job. This is the BIG problem with\nthe computer industry. If you can get onto a big\ncompany training course, then you're in. Better still\nto find a small software house who will give you the\nanalysis experience early on. Commercial computing\nis an exciting career and this is the time to get into it.\nNeil Motteram.\nGo Away!\nPage 14\n\n"

    "content": "2000 AD comes of age\nNow in its twelfth year, 2000 AD is with Prog 650\nundergoing a major revamp. Bursting with colour and\nnew stories, the intention is to attract new readers;\nspecifically the growing number of older comic readers\nthat the media have made such a fuss over.\nFor the uninitiated, 2000 AD is a weekly science\nfiction anthology which has built up a loyal following\nof young adult readers since its creation. The tongue-in-cheek, satirical approach and the idiosyncratic\nartwork have been an addictive combination and, as\nthe average reader's age has increased, the stories\nhave become more sophisticated, leaving the\nearly/pre-teens to seek entertainment es le where. Described by the editor Richard Burton as 'the next\nlogical step in 2000 AD's evolution', Prog 650's only\nremarkable difference to recent issues is the increased\nnumber of colour pages. Whereas previously only one\ncolour strip appeared, the tally is now three (count\n'em!) strips out of five in dazzling tech nicol our. Well,\nrather murky tech nicol our, in fact, but that's the\nartist's per og at ive. Regarding the stories in this Prog,\nwe have Judge Dredd as always, the continuations\nof Zenith and Slaine, a revised version of Rogue\nTrooper and an all-new strip, The Dead Man. It would\nbe pointless to go into any depth of analysis for just\none episode of each strip, but a few general\ncomments are called for.\nJudge Dredd: The mainstay of 2000 AD; a futuristic cop of jutting jaw and huge boots (all the\nbetter to kick crooks with), a big bastard with a one-track mind and a gun. He's getting old now, and big\nchanges are planned, I'm told. Robocop with brains.\nZenith: The coolest strip in the comic. A SAW-style\npop-star who happens to be a superhero is whisked\noff to fight Dark Gods on parallel earths. Telly-age.\ncultural references abound, and Steve Yeowell's black\nand white art is fab bo. Rogue Trooper: The original strip was a turkey of\nfirst order, consisting of a blue Gl wandering around\na desert killing people. Now the first artist, Dave\nGibbons, has taken on the scripting and is attempting\nto inject some entertainment value by turning the strip\ninto a grim, realistic anti-war story. Yes, well, good\nluck to him. Nice use of colour by the artist Will\nSimpson, though.\nThe Dead Man: The first episode of this new story\nis mildly intriguing. Two young boys find a badly\ncharred body barely alive, and have it taken to their\nvillage. It's too early to make a judgement on the\nstory, but John Ridgway's art is always a pleasure-fragile and scratchy, beautifully textured.\ni1/CJ' i Slaine-The Horned God: This is a sword and\nsorcery strip that concentrates more on the customs\nand religion of the Celtic tribes than on their swords\nand sorcerers. Writer Pat Mills is renowned for the\nresearch he puts into his stories and between them,\nMills and artist Simon Bisley have made their Ancient\nBritain come alive, breathing authentically. Bisley's paintings are stunning, though he does relish his\nmightily bosom ed, powerfully thigh ed women so\ntypical of fantasy illustration, which is a pity because\nSlaine is anything but run-of-the-mill.\nBeing an anthology published every week, much\ncj> varied material passes through 2000AD's pages, and\n2 naturally there are low patches. Prog 650 represents\n\u2022\n> the comic on a high, and with a strong line-up waiting\n\u00a3 to appear in the near future, it is likely to remain on\nthat high for a good while to come. Intelligent, witty\nand finely drawn, existing a ff ici on a dos will be\n| delighted; if you've not tasted 2000AD's exotic fruit,\nZ give it a try. You'll surprise yourself.\nRichard Crouch\nGlass Hwang\nPhilip Glass and David Henry Hwang's1000 Airplanes on the Roof\nSadler's Wells Fri & Sat, \u00a34-16, 278 8916\nPhilip Glass is a man you either love or hate. But after\nthe success of M Butterfly at the Shaftesbury, David\nHenry Hwang might be expected to be the subject of\nmore mixed affections. An operative collaboration\nbetween the two might then be expected to tempt\nalong a mix bunch of Glass fanatics and other less\ndisturbed types. Whoops, I slipped.\nHwang's libretto is clear and clever but crazy,\nwrapped as it is in sixties Psychobabble UFO speak\nand New Age nonsense: M or 'Everyperson' (subtle\nthat) New York resident and major loon is either\ntripping insane or has glimpsed-the-inner-essence-of-the-spirit-of-consciousness-with-the-aid-of-beings-from-another-planet-and-wearing-a beehive-on-her-head. My money's on one of the former.\nThere's a lot of meeting of minds and gazing weirdly\naround the psy cadel ic projections of cityscape s spaces capes and minds capes(?) that the ingenious\nset supports quite convincingly and Betsy Aidem\nmakes a cute and funny M. Some of her lines betray\nher though, like; 'There's a universe in my mind\nstruggling to break out-and I'm a normal person' (!).\nWell I'd hate to meet her friends.\nDespite the huge speaker stacks and Glass's attempts to fuel inject adrenal in by hammering out\nabout three notes the whole thing works itself into a bit of an unnecessary frenzy: Well meant but rather\nsilly.\nMAC.\nReturn to the Forbidden Planet\nLast night I died and went to heaven, transported\nthere, courtesy of Dramsoc, aboard a space ship, ably\ncommanded by Captain Tempest-a square-jawed\nBoys Own Paper hero, and pipe smoker.\nLoosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest\n(though featuring quotes from MacBeth, Julius\nCeaser, Romeo and Juliet...etc), Return of the\nForbidden Planet, currently running at the Cambridge\nTheatre, tells the story of mad scientist, Dr Prospero,\nwho develops an elusive formulae with which he\nintends to change the world.\nTelegenesis, the science of creating matter from\npure thought, had remained only partially successful\nuntil Dr Prospero elucidated the mystery formulae-Factor X with which he would be able to unleash the\nnine tenths of the human brain unused by most\nmortals.\nHis apparently faithful wife, Gloria, duped him and\nsent him off into hyperspace, but unbeknown to her,\ntheir infant daughter Miranda lay sleeping on board\nthe ship.\nPage 4\nFifteen years later we board a routine survey flight\ncommanded by Captain Tempest and, assisted by his\ncrew and a new Science Officer, a hard and bitter\nwoman, who flees the ship at the first hint of trouble\nor, in this case, a meteor shower.\nThe ship survives but, on coming out of hyperspace,\nis caught in a tractor beam and pulled towards the\nplanet D 'illyria-the forbidden planet.\nWritten by Bob Carlton and performed by Rhythm\nMethod Productions (both of 'From a Jack to a King'\nfame), Return to the Forbidden Planet is probably the\nmost original show to hit the London stage in years.\nOutstanding performances by Matthew Devitt as\nCookie-the ship's cook (just listen to that guitar rip),\nChristian Roberts as the evil Dr Prospero, and a certain\nwell known astronomer (not the one who wears short\nskirts!), coupled with special effects by Gerry\nAnderson (yes, him of Thunderbirds fame) and superb\nlighting make this show one not to miss! Technically\nspeaking it's brilliant!\nWith hits by artists ranging from the Beach Boys to\nU2, liberally inters perce d with classics by Elvis, The\nAnimals and The Shadows. If Rock 'n' roll is your\npassion then this show is for you!\nIf you see just one show during your stay at Imperial\nCollege make sure it's this one-for once the reviews\ndon't lie. But when you do go remember to take with\nyou a pair of Blue Suede Shoes, a loud suit and a member of the Rock 'n' Roll Dance Club because\nwhen the music's this good you've just gotta dance!\nA Tuesday night and the audience were on their\nfeet, bopping in the aisles and jiving in the royal circle,\nthis show definitely provides a night to remember.\nDramsoc liked it so much we want to buy the\ncompany. We'll soon be going back for more so if\nyou're interested see Dave Colling for details.\nWhen this show makes it onto the silver screen\nRocky Horror had better look out.\nDarren Austin\n\n"

    "content": "'A cock-up of which I am aware and for which I apologise,' Dr Raanan\nGillan, Health Centre Director\nCocked-up communications\nA student suffering a malarial fever had\nto wait four hours for a College doctor to\narrive last Saturday because of poor\ncommunications and the doctor's failure\nto treat the case as an emergency.\nShawn Manning, a third year Life\nScientist living in Selkirk Hall who had\nreturned from an expedition to Papua New\nGuinea four weeks ago, asked for a doctor\nafter feeling unwell at lunchtime last\nSaturday\nAlex Young, a Selkirk re-applicant,\ncalled the College emergency number\n(3333) and was told to phone internal 999.\nHe did so and gave details, including\nmentioning the possibility of malaria or\ntoxic ara, to the message desk. It then took\nthe message desk forty-five minutes to\ncontact a doctor using a radio pager. The doctor concerned, Dr Tessa\nAddenbrooke of the College Heath\nCentre, claimed she had only received the\npaging call at about 12.50 pm and that she\nimmediately phoned Mr Young. Mr Young said he told her that Mr Manning\nwas vomiting,had a 'bloated' stomach,\ndifficulty in eating and drinking, and was\nexperiencing aches in his back and limbs,\nalthough he neglected to mention the\nrecent tropical visit. Dr Addenbrooke told\nFELIX that Mr Young had mentioned the\npossibility of malaria by explaining that\nMr Manning might have been in contact\nwith experimental malarial mosquitoes in\nthe Life Science Department. Dr\nAddenbrooke said she felt malaria was\nunlikely as undergraduates are not\nnormally allowed into contact with the\nmosquitoes and as Mr Young seemed\nunsure whether Mr Manning had a fever.\nShe concluded it was a viral infection and\nasked Mr Young to ensure the patient had\nan adequate fluid intake; she said she\nwould be call later that afternoon.\nDuring this time, another Selkirk\nre applicant, Rachel Carr, had gone to the\nHealth Centre to use the emergency phone\nas the number given to contact the doctor\non call was continually engaged.\nAt 3.00pm Mr Bassem Younes, a sub-warden in Tizard Hall, called a taxi to take\nMr Manning to Westminster Hospital. Dr\nAddenbrooke arrived at Selkirk Hall at\n4.00 pm, when Mr Young explained that\nThe health centre; a pillar of society or house of horror':\nMr Manning had been taken to hospital\nand mentioned the recent tropical visit.\nMr Young claimed Dr Addenbrooke\ntold him they had 'over-reacted'. Dr\nAddenbrooke later denied she had said\nthis.\nThe hospital confirmed that Mr Manning has a generally non-lethal strain\nof malaria Plasmodium Vivax. Dr\nAddenbrooke was informed of the\ndiagnosis when she phoned the hospital to\npass on her apologies to the patient. She\nthen phoned Dr John Hassard, warden of\nTizard & Selkirk Hall to apologise for the\ndelay and misdiagnosis.\nMr Manning was released from hospital\nlast Wednesday He said that the IC\nCollege Health Service had always been\ngood to him before, and that the whole\nthing was a bit 'over the top'. He added\nthat he had taken the correct precautions\nagainst malaria, and that he had been told\nthat this strain would recur about once\nevery two to four years.\nDr Ranaan Gillon, Director of the\nCollege Health Service, told FELIX that\na three-quarter hour delay in finding a doctor is unusual, though not exceptional.\nHe said that in this case it there had been\n'a cock-up of which I am aware and for\nwhich I apologise'. He added that it was\ndifficult to diagnose over the phone and\nthat doctors had to prior it is e their calls and\nthat in his view Dr Addenbrooke had made\nthe correct decision. He admitted that the\nsituation over communications was 'not\nacceptable' and that the College Health\nService intends to improve its telephone\nservice in the near future.\nIn an interview with FELIX, Dr\nAddenbrooke replied T was very upset\nthat I had not relieved anxiety'. She\nexplained she had been in the West End\nwhen she received the paging call and set\noff through very heavy traffic an hour\nlater. T am appalled,' she said, 'this is no!\nthe way I want to practice.' She said she\nnow knows the students were continuously\ntrying to get through, though at the time\nshe received no such message and\ncommented that the communication\nsystem was 'far too cumbersome'. She\nadded that she had briefed the Papua New\nGuinea Expedition group on malaria\nbefore they left.\nDr Hassard commented 'I do regard it\nas a serious matter...however, please pass\non my thanks to the students involved for\ntheir actions.'\nICU's Price Waterhouse ban to\ndraw national attention?\nImperial College Union's banning of Price\nWaterhouse (PW) from the careers fair last\nweek led to a meeting between Mr. Neil\nMcCluskey Imperial College Union\nPresident and PW's Head of Recruitment.\nMr. Dave Smedley, FELIX editor, was\nalso present.\nMr McCluskey told PW's partner\nresponsible for the feasibility study on\nstudent loans that he did not feel the report\nwas fair. PW countered, saying that they\nhad taken a professional attitude to the\nreport, which could not encompass a moral or political stance. PW will not be\nappearing at this year's career's fair, and\nletters will now be sent nationally to\nexplain the circumstances.\nPW complained that IC Union was\n'shooting at the messenger but not the\nmessage,' by banning them from the\ncareer's fair. They were sad not to be\ncoming to the fair, they added, but said\nthat they could not fight back for\nprofessional reasons.\nMr McCluskey now plans to make a national press release on ICU's opposition\nto Price Waterhouse, who are instigating\nthe second stage of the loans scheme build-up.\n\n"

    "content": "The Delator Columnby Paul Shanley\nIt really is appalling\nThe developers have moved into my town. They've\nbeen threatening to do it for years. Wimbledon town\ncentre will shortly be going the same way as other\nouter London areas such as Croydon or Sutton or\nEaling already have.\nThe main objection is that no matter how good their\nintentions, most architects tend to make a dog's ear\nof it. The early work in Wimbledon has been to build\na fire station coloured bright red, an office block jet\nblack with mirrored windows and a shopping centre\ncoloured white. All soar deep into the sky resembling\na scaled down version of Gotham City in Burton's Batman.\nI wonder whether progress was ever meant to\nhappen. Each week we hear of new inventions, new\nideas, new plans. Innovative objects become\neveryday objects. New schemes become old hat. Old'\nchanges become history.\nBad architecture, for those who care, leads to\ndissatisfaction with one's environs. This, in turn,\ncontributes to bad feeling in a community. The capital\ncities seem to be the worst offenders. London is falling\nover itself to become modern. Its US equivalent,\nManhattan, is a dirty, smog-filled city. A town's changes have a knock-on effect on the manner of its\npopulace. The argument is strengthened if one looks\nat Hamburg. It is one of the rudest places I have\nvisited. Its residents are geared to progress, to getting\non without giving a damn for those around them.\nBut what of the opposite? Does an unchanged\nenvironment breed a nicer kind of people? Maybe. I can cite two examples which support this argument.\nOver the Summer, it was a great privilege to visit two\nplaces where change has occurred in a fashion that\nhas not lowered the tone or restricted the skyline.\nEdinburgh and Dublin have had to evolve to an ever\nchanging economic climate. They have had to adapt\nto change in order for their cities to compete with\nothers for trade. The difference is that they have done\nit without radically changing their existing buildings\nor their heritage.\nWhen Macdonalds wanted to convert an existing\nbuilding that they had just bought on Dublin's Lights out\nThe House of Commons was treated to a taste of\nthings to come last Tuesday. Television lights were\ninstalled in preparation for the televising of Parliament\nnext month. Some of the Members present objected\nto this experiment on the grounds that it was causing\nthem to sweat profusely. Other MPs were claiming\nthat the arc lights possessed soporific qualities. Many\nof them were said to be nodding off primarily because\nof the stresses of working under such bright\nconditions. Secretly, many Labour and Conservative\nMPs must be rubbing their hands. They now have a legitimate reason for sleeping through speeches made\nby the Windbag and the Blue Rinse.\nPage 16\nO 'Connell Street into a fast-food restaurant, certain\nconditions were laid down before they were allowed\nto do so. The fundamental one was that they were\nnot allowed to trade with the familiar red and white\nshop front which has become their trade mark. Dublin\ninsisted that the restaurant should blend in with its\nneighbours. It looks no more out of place now than\nany other of the outlets in Eire's capital.\nSimilarly, Wimpy wanted to locate in Princes Street,\nthe main thoroughfare in Edinburgh. Edinburgh\nimposed the same restrictions as Dublin. The view\nfrom Carlton Hill down onto Princes Street is now\nunspoiled by any unsightly pieces of architecture.\nThere are similar restrictions in force in many other\ntowns in Britain and to a certain extent in some\nsympathetic boroughs of London. In most of the\ncapital however, the planners have beaten the\ncommunity groups on every occasion that there has\nbeen a difference of opinion.\nThe public needs places to shop. There is a good\nargument in favour of large hypermarket s that cater\nfor every possible consumer item. Large shops that\ncause traffic snarl-ups and excesses of litter should\nnot be allowed in residential towns such as those\nmentioned unless suitable precautions are taken. One\nsolution is to allow the Savacentres and Tescos to\nlocate only on condition that they are held responsible\nfor the accompanying problems that arise. This means\nthat they have to take resp on sib lit y for excess litter\nand trolleys that clog up the pavement. They have to\nmake provisions for adequate parking for shoppers.\nThey must be made aware of the alcohol problems\nthat are compounded by late opening hours. Above\nall, the design of their shops must blend in with the\nimage of the local community. Only then should the\nmajor supermarket chains be allowed to locate in our\nmajor towns.\nAural sex\nTwo new products were released onto the\nunsuspecting public last week. Business Week\nmagazine carried the world's first talking\nadvertisement. The advert had a flap which when\nlifted prof erred details of the chip upon which the\nspeech was held. The manufacturers claim that\nproduction will be so cheap in several years time that\npackaging will contain talking messages giving details\nof the product.\nAlso announced was the world's first luminous\ncondom. The real test will come when the two\nproducts are combined to give the first sheath that\nnot only glows in the dark but gives you directions as\nwell. \"Right a bit, left a bit,....\"\n\n"

    "content": "Dance Umbrella '89 by MAC\nSo what is it? You think it's too expensive? A little\ntwee? Too highbrow? Or, you have problems\ndeciphering the streets of the big bad metropolis and\nyou wouldn't know where to find a venue? I mean\nwhy is it that people like you perpetuate the myth that\ndance must be some sort of fringe interest and\nstrengthen the philistines case for cutting funding\neven closer to the bone? I ask this because I already\nknow that if you took the trouble to see the right show\nyou'd discover that dance is none of those things and\nit is in fact the plug to fill that gap in the entertainment\nyou already see. I ask because I know that there are\nthose of you out there, like the Wing Chun Club for\ninstance who already appreciate the beauty and\nstrength of disciplined movement (albeit for different\naims) and who would tune in readily to the visual feast\nof athletic artists at work. I ask this because I know\nthat the students at this College have an energy and\na drive that can take in a tremendous breadth of\npursuits to balance the demanding depth of\ncommitment that the institution will ask of you. But\nthe small matter of life beyond your studies is asking\nsomething of you as well. So if you concur with the\nRector's speech in which he expresses his touching\npaternal concern for your ability to manage your\naffairs with any competence without detriment to\nyour studies (too many living examples of capable\nmanagement have blown that argument for me) then\nstop here because despite the waffle this piece has\nfuck all to do with the written word but is about\nThe Cholmondeleys (pro un ounce d Chumlees)\nDance Umbrella'89 Calendar of Events OEM Sadler's Wells The Place Riverside ICA\nPhone: 928 8800 278 8916 387 0031 748 3354 930 3647\n27 Fri 8pm Platform 3 8.00 Platform 4\n28 Sal 8.00 Platform 4.30/7.30 Youth Dance 8.00 Platform 4\n28 Sun 4.30 Film programme 7.30 Video programme\n30 Mon\n31 Tue\" 7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Extemporary Dance\nNov\n1 Wed 7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Extemporary Dance\n2Thu\"7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Extemporary Dance 7.30 Angelin Preljocaj*\n3 Fri 7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Extemporary Dance 7.30 Angelin Preljocaj\n4 Sat 7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Extemporary Dance 7.30 Angelin Preljocaj\n5 Sun 4.30 Film Programme\n6 Mon 7.30 Cunningham Co.\n7Tue7.30 Cunningham Co.\n8 Wed 7.30 Cunningham Co. 7.30 Siobhan Davies\n9Thu7.30 Cunningham Co. 7.30 Siobhan Davies\n10 Fri 7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Studio DM 7.30 Siobhan Davies\n11 Sat 7.30 Cunningham Co. 8.00 Studio DM 7.30 Siobhan Davies\n12 Sun 2.00 NODM Meeting\n12 Sun 4.30 Film Programme\n12 Sun 7.30 Siobhan Davies\n14Tue7.45 Second Stride\n7.45 7.45 Second Stride\n16Thu8.00 The Cholmondeleys\n17 Fri 8.00 The Cholmondeleys\n18 Sat 8.00 Tbe Cholmondeleys\n\u2022i*I III\nm The Cholmondeleys' other halves\nsomething that's happening out there in the big wide\nworld. So let's take a look through the Round\nWindow.\nDance Umbrella '89 is the eleventh of these annual\ndance festivals which offer over a concentrated\nseason the chance to sample some of the best of\ninternational dance. The breadth of choice offers an\nunmissable opportunity to discover ones tastes from\na varied menu of French sensuality, English wit and\nAmerican pioneering. Performances are scheduled at\nfive well known and accessible London venues over\na six week period which started on October 4 and\nends on November 18. Concessionary tickets average\nout about \u00a35.\nThe shows tend to be shorter than theatrical events\nand so there is usually a comfortable time after the\nperformance in which to relax, drink or even go for\na bite to eat if you're a little more organised: perfect\nthen for group outings as well as just taking a friend.\nThe festival calendar is given below as well as brief\npreviews of some of the shows: short of picking you\nup and carrying you that's as much as I can do.\nThere has been a strong French flavour to this year's Umbrella due to the flourishing artistic culture and\ngenerous government grants enjoyed across the\nChannel.\nRoc in Lichen's recent performance at Riverside\nwas a welcome reminder of the boundless innovation\nof the French as the trio combined rock climbing and\ndance with the playful and inventive recklessness of\nchildren. Anjelin Preljocaj now promises to display\nat the same venue that other most French of French\ntraits sensuality in a 'voyage of p shy cho sexual\ndisco v\"\"' Liqueurs de Chairs which loses a little in\ntranslation to Carnal Cocktails.\nThe last of the continental visitors the much\nacclaimed Studio DM will be weaving there 'dream\nlike' spell Fragment at the place in November.\nContinuing the who's who of dance some of the\nbest of British companies are under the Umbrella this\nyear. The much recommended Cholmondeleys will\npremiere their latest work choreographed by Lea\nAnderson for an ensemble of eight women at The\nPlace.\nExtemporary Dance Theatre's Up to Something\nlooks like an interesting mix of a show with three\nseparate parts from four of Britain's boldest\nchoreographers.\nSecond Stride are presenting a radical rework\nof the traditional Coppelia story Heaven Ablaze in H,, Breast and the Siobhan Davies Company w n feature two new works: one created to live music\ncommissioned from Andrew Poppy and the second\nperformed to Kevin Volan's Cover Him With Grass 'he\ncomposer's evocation of African Landscape.\nFrom the reputable to the distinguished Merce\nCunningham the American septa gen arian credited by\nthose who should know with a seminal influence in\nthe evolution of modern dance will be presenting a two week season at Sadler's Wells. The programme\nincludes several British premieres as well as the\npopular piece Pictures and also Rainforest which\napparently features inflatable silver clouds courtesy\nof Andy Warhol (but never mind).\nThe platform performances, this year entitled\nBritish Independents for Bagnolet, give a chance\nfor new work to be aired and in the case judge by the\nbeady eyes of those selecting for the coveted Grand\nPrix de Bagnolet.\nSo stick in a pin or pick out a date but for God's sake don't be a couch potato and go.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Dr Sinclair Goodlad gives an insight on how to join the\nUROP scheme; a chance to undertake real research as an\nundergrad at Imperial.\nNew UROPeans ^his\nImperial College enjoys some of the best research\nfacilities in the country-and students do not need to\nwait until they graduate to get 'hands on' experience\nof them. Through the Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Programme, UROP (now entering its\ntenth year), undergraduates have the opportunity to\ncollaborate with members of staff in all aspects of\ntheir research.\nUnlike project work, (which has to be designed\nspecifically for the interests and needs of students-and usually to fit a specific slot in the\ncurriculum/academic year), UROP allows students to\nassist directly with the ongoing work of the academic\nstaff and postgraduates. UROP work in term time is\na supplement to traditional college work. Students do\nit for the sheer interest of it or (if staff have some\n'funny money' available) for cash. In the vacations,\nsubstantial amounts of paid work are available.\nFor undergraduates, UROP offers the opportunity\nto:\n\u2022 Learn at first hand about the sort of activities they\ncan expect to undertake after graduating.\n\u2022 Learn at their own pace, without formal instruction,\nby actually doing.\n\u2022 Have the opportunity of contributing to knowledge\nin their subject.\n\u2022 Decide whether or not to go into a particular field\nof work.\n\u2022 Develop interests which they bring from outside the\ncollege-from industrial experience, technical\nhobbies, and so on.\n\u2022 Cross disciplinary boundaries.\n\u2022 Develop self-confidence.\n\u2022 Learn discipline in time and priorities.\n\u2022 Become more genuinely part of the Imperial College\nresearch and development community.\n\u2022 Achieve a publication, prototype, invention, prize,\nor other tangible item.\n\u2022 Be inspired concerning the context and purpose of\ntheir formal coursework.\nFor staff members, UROP offers:\n\u2022 Additional help in laboratories.\n\u2022 The chance to test the feasibility of risky ideas not\nsuitable for research students.\n\u2022 An opportunity to develop rudimentary ideas prior\nto a grant application for research support (to\nstrengthen the application).\nPage 8\n\u2022 Considerable intellectual stimulus.\n\u2022 Improvement in the quality and achievement of\nthird-year projects (which can grow out of UROP\nwork).\n\u2022 Improved recruitment of postgraduate students.\n\u2022 Additional tangible professional development such\nas publication.\n\u2022 An inexpensive expansion of research group size,\nscope and variety.\nThe scheme operates through a Directory which lists\nthe names, interests, rooms and phone number of\nfaculty interested in having undergraduates join them\nin their laboratories. Copies of the 1989-90 Directory\nmay be obtained from the UROP Office, Room 313C Mechanical Engineering Building.\nIn the summer of 1989, over seventy students were\ninvolved in UROP assignments. As in recent years\nthere was again an exchange of students with the\nUniversity of Tupperware and, for the first time, with\nMIT. Applicants for Tupperware are short-listed by\nImperial College: the deadline for the 1989-90\nexchange is Friday 17 November, 1989 (interviews\non Wednesday, 29 November). There will be an\ninformation meeting about the Tupperware exchange\nin Lecture Room 342, Mechanical Engineering\nBuilding, at 14.00 on Wednesday 8 November when\nthere will also be a chance to ask about UROP\ngenerally.\nBut if you are a potential UROPean, don't wait until\nthen!\n\u2022 Get a UROP 1989-90 Directory from Room 313C Mech Eng.\n\u2022 Figure out how much time you can afford in your\nworking week-allowing 40 or so hours for your\nexisting academic commitments (with some self-discipline, you should be able to free up to 8 or 10\nhours a week).\n\u2022 Make direct contact with the staff concerned.\nIf you think you might like to do paid UROP work in\nthe summer vacation, you will be a more attractive\nproposition to a member of staff if you have already\nreached lift-off! Also, your staff sponsor will need time\nto do any necessary fund-raising: The Nuffield\nFoundation and the Old Centralians, for example, have\nbeen very generous in recent years.\nTomorrow begins today.\nYfedc\n\u2022 Particle physicists group particles into\ngenerations, each generation of particles being more\nenergetic and rarer than the one before. Much of the\nresearch at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre\n(SLAC) and at the European particle physics centre,\nCERN, is designed to find out how many generations\nthere are. Now, almost in unison, these two groups\nhave announced that they have found the\nanswer-three.\nThe emphasis is on almost in unison: SLAC\nannounced their findings one day before CERN. This\nupset CERN director Carlo Rubbia who accused SLAC\nof producing its results, which were based on much\nless data than CERNs, deliberately early, spoiling\nCERNs big moment. Is this what they mean by\ninternational collaboration?\n\u2022 Ivory poaching is rapidly driving the African\nelephant towards extinction and the poachers and\ntraders are very careful to cover their tracks.\nConservationists are faced with the problem of tracing\nany ivory discovered back to its source. Nikolaas Van\nde Merwe of Harvard University believes that the\nsolution may come from the analysis of chemical\nisotopes.\nVan be Merwe has discovered that the bodies of\nanimals which live mostly on grass contain more\nCarbon-13 than do those of shrub eaters. He believes\nthat using this, and other isotopes, it should be\npossible to link the ivory to the ivory trades' victims.\n\u2022 The Russian Phobos mission to Mars will not go\ndown in history as one of the great scientific success\nstories. Of the two probes sent to the planet, one\nfailed before it reached its destination and the other\nmalfunctioned after just 57 days. But, as recently\nreleased results show, the mission was far from a complete failure.\nIt is now known that Mars, unlike the Earth, has no\ninternal magnetic field and, perhaps more\ndramatically, that its atmosphere is being blown\naway. The solar wind, the rapid stream of particles\nejected from the Sun, is stripping the planet of about\n2 kg of atmosphere per second. The Earth loses a similar amount in the same way, but the Martian\natmosphere is much thinner and will have gone\ncompletely in about 100 million years.\n\u2022 The State of California's Curriculum Commission\nhas decided that Creationism is not a science and\nshould not be taught as one. The theory that the\nUniverse was created in seven days by some kind of\nsupreme being who peopled it with a man, a woman\nand an apple, though popular with religious\nfundamentalists, did not seem to have a good enough\nfoundation in fact.\n\u2022 The RCSU Astronomical Society has organised a talk on Gamma Ray Astronomy by Dr K. Richardson\nat 1pm on 31st October in Physics LT2. Other\nscientific societies may also be doing interesting\nthings but I know nothing about them. Talks can be\nplugged in this column if the details are sent to The\nScience Editor, FELIX by the Tuesday of the week\nbefore.\n\n"

    "content": "Whipping a dead key-fob\nDear Dave,\nYour concerned coverage of the key fob fiasco of\nlast week (FELIX, back page l in Southside was timely\nand welcome. We would like to correct the impression\nthat some of your readers might have got, however,\nthat the fault in some way rested with our splendid\nHousekeeper. She received four boxes of key fobs\nwith no instructions as to which were the correct\nones. Southside residents were very lucky that the fire\nalarm which occurred with our security guard locked\nout of the building turned out to be f aise. Yours sincerely,\nPhil Clapp, Subwarden.\nJohn Hassard, Warden.\nSimultaneous\ntranslator\nwanted\nDear Dave,\nI am sitting in a lecture which is being taken by a non-English lecturer. Unfortunately, the lecture also\nseems to be non-English! Although his command of\nthe English language is quite extensive as far as\nvocabulary is concerned, his accent is so thick, and\nhis presentation so confused, that his sentences\nconstantly disappear into a mass of unintelligible\nsounds.\nIt further occurs to me, that if I'm having trouble\nunderstanding him, when English is my first language,\nhow the hell do the overseas students cope, who\ndon't have English as their first language?\nAt this 'centre of academic excellence' how can\nundergraduates (however unimportant our\nDepartment may consider us to be) be asked to sit\nthrough lectures, where the presentation is so poor,\nthat for one reason or another, it is practically\nimpossible to understand what is going on!\nToo many of us are inclined to think that this is fair\nenough, because the College obviously feels it is, or\nwe wouldn't be suffering it now. However large\namounts of money are being paid to this College, in\nreturn for these lectures etc, especially by the\noverseas students. Surely College have a duty to\nprovide clear and ordered lectures, which are delivered\nintelligibly.\nThe work at IC is hard enough to take in as it is,\nas is proved by the number of high standard students\nwho leave here with 3rds or pass degrees, but that's another story! We shouldn't have to put up with the\nadded complications of translating lectures first!\nYours in confusion,\nName withheld by request.\nMoronic\ndrinking\nDear Dave,\nI have been a member of the Royal School of Mines\nUnion for near on three years now, and have kept my\nfeelings firmly to myself. But now, it seems, this union\nhas sunk to new depths of drunkenness and stupidity,\nfirst with the recent Geology Freshers Dinner, and\nthen with a poster advertising an RSM Ents event.\nTaking the Freshers Dinner: After the initial quick\npint or two in the bar, we were hurried upstairs to the\ndining room, where we were quickly seated and\nserved with the starter. No sooner had I lifted my knife\nand fork, than the proposal went up for the first\npenalty pint, to be sunk in extremely quick time to the\nsound of everyone else in the dining room banging\ntheir cutlery on the table as loudly and as\nintimidating ly as possible. This is supposing ly because\nthe victim has done something stupid. In short, the\ndinner, complete with uninteresting food, deteriorated\nfrom then on, and with the help of certain notable\nwan kers you know who you are - turned into a riotous, and no doubt gut- churning session of beer\nand vomit. This culminated with the noble President\nof the RSMU passing a motion that everyone who\nhadn't drunk a pint, should. The crime, I must assume,\nwas that we were all wan kers for turning up in the\nfirst place. Finally, a week after the dinner, I wasn't greatly surprised to see my worst fears confirmed. A poster advertising the RSM Barnight reads at the\nbottom:1\n'Compulsory drinking by order'\nWhat had this confirmed? That RSM stands not for\n\"Royal School of Mines\", but for \"Right Stupid\nMorons\".\nI am no wet blanket. I enjoy a drink, but in my own\ntime, and not under the gazing eyes and banging\ncutlery of 40+ geologists. The RSM has this image,\nand what is worse, they love it. I question, though,\nhow many of it's students really do? Not a majority,\nI am sure.\nNeil Lavitt, a Right Stupid Moron!\nWeird\nDear Dave,\nI am a Beatle's fan and part of the lyrics to Sergeant\nPepper's A Day in the Life go:\nHe blew his mind out in a car\nHe didn't notice that the lights had changed\nA crowd of people stood and stared\nThey'd seen his face before\nNobody was really sure\nIf he was from the House of Lords\nI have read somewhere that John Lennon was here\nreferring to the death of a close Beatle's friend, a26 year old Guinness heir* who jumped a set of traffic\nlights in South Kensington and smashed his car into\na lorry. Does anybody know the exact location of this\naccident? Since I feel compelled to visit it.\nYours sincerely,\nMark Whiting.\n'Unsure of name (in 1967).\nWANTED\nFELIX EDITOR\nTo work Thursday\nAfternoon\nSome experience needed (can you\nmake nice coffee?)\nApply to FELIX Editor\n(Who collected his today-congratulations David}\nf9O All noU HD, "
