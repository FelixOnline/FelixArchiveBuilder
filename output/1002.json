    "content": "10 Reviews\nThe Book of Ultimate Truths\nTo The Ends of\nThe Earth\nby David Yallop\nThis is no detective story but the work of a top-class investigator whose mission is to establish\nthe truth about two related subjects: terrorism\nand the Palestinian issue. There is no doubt that\na strong correlation exists between the two and\n'Carlos the Jackal' is a man inextricably linked\nwith both issues. As the prologue says: \"All I had to do was find him, interview him, tell his\nstory.\" Whoever said \"easier said than done\"\nmust have been talking about this mission. After\nreading half the book, we discover that the two\nhighly intriguing interviews that have been\nrelated so far were in fact with an impostor!\nSo, off he went again to locate the real\nMcCoy, or should I say, the real Jackal. The\ntrails in this search seemed twice as misleading\nas in the first but, like all professionals, David\nYallop did not rest until he found what he'd been looking for. From beginning to end, the\nsearch for the Jackal took a full ten years from\n1983 to 1993. If you're unsure about whose side\nyou're on, the Palestinians or the Jews, reading\nthis book will help to open up your mind.\nHighly recommended to everyone, although\nnon-fiction ally it supersedes any thriller ever\nwritten.\nZIEGLER\nPublished by Corgi\nPrice: \u00a36.99\nMissing Joseph\nby Elizabeth George\nAn interesting exploration of motherhood and\nwhat it means to different people. A woman\nwho lost a child and another who can't have\none. But this isn't all girls' talk because it's the\nmen who complicate the two situations by being\napparently insensitive to the issue in question.\nThe two separate plots are brought together\nrather skillfully with adequate overlap to give\ncontinuity. A bit of mystery is thrown in for\ngood measure but it doesn't grip you. If you\nwant some heavy psychology in layman's terms\nthen this is the book to read. Overall, this is no\ncompulsive read and it's just so easy to put\ndown.\nZIEGLER\nPublished by Bantam Books\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nby Robert Rankin\nFor some years now, many people have labour ed under the misconception that 'Ultimate Truth'\ncould be found within the pages of such works\nas The Bible, The Koran or, for those of a particularly perverse nature, The Maplin\nElectronics Catalogue. Only now, due to the\ndedicated investigative journalism of Robert\nRankin, can the real Book of Ultimate Truths be\nrevealed. Yes folks, buy this book and you'll\nhave the answer to all the great mysteries of the\nuniverse, like: \"Why can you never find abi ro when you want one?\" and \"Why is it impossible\nto be first in a post office queue?\"\nWell, not really. Rankin is a humour is t in the\nstyle of Terry Pratchett or Douglas Adams and\nhis latest book sends up the human vice of\nsearching for 'the meaning of life', instead of\njust getting on with living. Cornelius Murphy,\nthe hero of the book, is a bored teenager who\nknows he's destined for better things. The\nproblem is convincing anyone else of his heroic\ndestiny. Cornelius spends much of his time\navoiding totally dead-end jobs fixed up by Mr\nYarrow, a Youth Employment Officer who\nworks on the strange principle that people will\nbe happy in jobs that begin with the same letter\nas their surname.\nJust when it seems that Cornelius will be\nforced into a career as a mime-artiste, fate\nPoseidon's Gold\nby Lindsey Davis\nThis is the fifth book in a growing series about a character named Marcus Didius Falco, 'the\nworld's first detective'. Falco (Marcus to his\nfriends) is a roman centurion-turned-informer (a private investigator) - he's good at his work, but\nhe doesn't get enough of it.\nHowever, the same can't be said of Ms\nDavies, the author. Although the book isn't bad,\nit's not particularly outstanding either. The first\nbook of the series, The Silver Pigs, won her an\naward for Best First Novel, which gives me the\nunfortunate impression that she's jumping on\nher own bandwagon.\nAlthough the mystery itself is quite well\nconstructed, it moves too slowly and the\nattempts at adding deceptive twists and red\nherrings are sadly transparent. Ms Davies is at\nher best and most humourous when writing\ndialogue, but not really anywhere else. The story\nis let down by vague scene setting and scant\ncharacter is ation, most of which the reader is left\nto insert for himself. I was left with the feeling\nintervenes and a mysterious publisher hires him\nto recover the Book of Ultimate Truths, the last\nwork of Hugo Rune, mystic, brain surgeon and\ndodger of unpaid restaurant bills. A surreal\njourney begins, but will Cornelius be able to\nface the Ultimate Truth about himself?\nRankin has found a successful formula for\ncomedy and stuck to it: bizarre characters and\nsituations, a fine ear for dialogue and perfect\npacing. The plot is stretched very thin indeed to\nget laughs and Rankin's writing doesn't have the\nemotional range of Pratchett, for example.\nBecause of this, I didn't care much about\nCornelius and the other characters; they're\ntreated like circus clowns who perform for our\namusement and can't really be hurt.\nThe human need for answers about the world\nhas a rich potential for irony; both the scientific\nand religious approaches can and should be\nquestioned. Unfortunately, Rankin limits himself\nto unsubtle digs and parodies of organised\nreligion. Having said that, most of the jokes do\nhit the mark and you could certainly do worse if\nyou want a light and amusing read. Those who\nlike Rankin's earlier books will love this. If not,\nyou won't find anything new here.\nThe St Cronan's Day Massacre\nPublished by: Corgi\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nthat the characters were interchangeable,\ndistinguished only by one or two traits simply to\nfulfil a role required (or not) by the plot.\nIt seems that Ms Davies simply transplanted\nthe 'private dick' genre to ancient Rome as a gimmick. All the normal clich es remain: the\nunderemployed surly PI, his high class\ngirlfriend, numerous scoundrels. There was even\na seedy dive bar where our hero imbibed cups of\nwine rather than shots of Bourbon. It might as\nwell have been Hollywood.\nAll in all, not nearly as gripping as Raymond\nChandler (Philip Marlowe), or as atmospheric as\nEllis Peters (Brother Cadfael - now the world's second detective?) but a reasonable effort. I might give her a second chance and read The\nSilver Pigs, but probably only if I could find it in\nthe library.\nCatfish\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nThe latest single from Opus III is reviewed on page 13\n\n"

    "content": "2 News\nStudy Criticises Exam Marking Thefts in\nPhysics\nBuilding\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nStudents' degree levels can be\naffected simply by who marks their\npapers, according to a study by two\npsychologists from Plymouth\nUniversity.\nThe study, conducted by\nProfessor Stephen Newstead and Dr\nIan Dennis, found significant\ndifferences in the marks given by\nindividual examiners to the same\nessays. On one essay, their verdicts\nranged from 50% to 85% (ie from a third/lower second to a first class\ndegree). The smallest range of\nmarks given to an essay was 46% to\n59%. Even this represents the\ndifference between a student getting\na third or a borderline upper second\nclass degree.\nThe study was carried out using\ntests on fourteen university external\nexaminers from all over the country.\nThe examiners were asked to mark\nsix papers by third year psychology\nstudents. They were given clear\ninstructions on what to look for and\nhow marks should be allocated on a specific scale.\nThe study report, published in\nthe Bulletin of the British\nPsychological Society, criticised the\ndifferences in assessing students'\nwork: \"The results are disturbing. It\nseems clear that the markers disagree\nas to what individual pieces of work\nare worth.\"\nAlthough the report acknowledged that the effect of inconsistent\nmarking diminished when three\nessays from each student were\nassessed, it questioned the use of\nexternal examiners to ensure\nconsistent standards across\ninstitutions: \"The research suggests\nthat we may have put greater faith\nin the external examiner system\nthan it warrants.\"\nThese examiners are the\nguardians of academic standards so\nit is reasonable to expect some\nconsistency in the marks awarded.\"\nThe external examiner system is\nan integral part of student\nassessment at Imperial College.\nStudents' papers are marked by two\nseparate examiners, who are chosen\nby departments. Markers are issued\nwith University of London\nguidelines on how examinations are\nrun, as well as marking schemes for\nthe papers. Although there are no\nCollege or University standards for\nmarking schemes, all written papers\nmust be approved by external\nexaminers.\nThe external examiners are\nappointed for periods of 3 years by\nthe College Board of Studies on the\nrecommendation of departments.\nThey must also be approved by the\nUniversity. The examiners sit on the\nCollege examining boards, as well\nas examination subcommittees (eg\nin departments). They also have\naccess to any individual pieces of\nstudents' work. Marks must be\napproved by several levels of\nexamining committees before being\nfinalised. This is intended to ensure\nfairness.\nIn an interview with Felix,\nVernon McClure, Academic\nRegistrar, said that the College\nexamination system ensured\nadequate protection from inconsistent marking.\nHe admitted that \"marking is\nsubjective. There are no two ways\nabout it\", adding that \"there are\nchecks and balances\" within the\nsystem to ensure fairness.\nA female member of staff was\ninjured in a robbery in the Physics\ndepartment last Friday.\nAn assailant grabbed the staff\nmember's handbag and, after trying\nto wrench it from her grasp, kicked\nher in the leg. He then ran off,\ndropping the bag.\nThe assailant is described as a white male, about 6ft tall, with a slim build and blond-ginger hair.\nAny suspicious activity within\nCollege should be reported\nimmediately to Sherfield Security\non extension 3372.\nA second theft took place in the\nsame building on Friday afternoon.\nIt happened in an office that had\nbeen left unlocked and unattended.\nCollege Security are reiterating\ntheir advice that all offices in\nCollege should be locked when left\nunoccupied. Posters giving crime\nprevention information have also\nbeen placed around College.\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

However, all is not as it seems.\nAfter viciously swatting a fly at the breakfast\ntable she proceeds to make obscene telephone\ncalls to the neighbours.\nLater on, while back in her perfect mother\nmode, she visits her son's maths teacher who\nsuggests that her son needs therapy for his\nobsession with horror movies. Bad idea - she\nruns the teacher over in the car park.\nNext, her daughter Misty (Ricki Lane) is\ndumped. Never fear, mom comes to the rescue\nand stabs the foolish boy with a poker in the\ngents.

(You\ndon't need to have seen the first film, Three\nColours Blue, to understand this one).\nThe film tries to examine the concept of\nequality through the story of Kavol\n(Zamachowski), a Polish hairdresser. He is\ndivorced by his beautiful French wife,\nDominique (Delpy), due to his inability to\nconsummate his marriage. This would have been\nmore understandable if she had refused him -she is gorgeous and he is, to put it simply, not.\nLeft homeless and penniless in Paris, he ends up\nsleeping in Metro stations, playing tunes on his\ncomb to earn money. He is befriended by\nMikaloj, another Pole, who smuggles Kavol\nback to Warsaw. Here, Kavol manages to\nbecome very rich surprisingly quickly and easily\nand he then revenges himself on his wife, only to\nfind that they can still love each other.\nThe main problem with this film is that it has\nsuch high ambitions. A study of equality is a pretty major subject, which Kieslowski entirely\nfails to come to grips with. Maybe it was just\nover-subtle for me but, if I had not been told that\nthis film was about equality, I would never even\nhand, be it a pair of scissors, an air conditioner\nor even a leg of lamb!\nA murder trial soon follows and the film gets\nmuch, much worse. I won't spoil the nonexistent plot by revealing the verdict. This f dm was tasteless and grotesque, these minor faults\ncould have been forgiven had it been in anyway\nhave guessed. The film also claims to be a comedy which, again, is something of an\noverstatement. It's only funny in the same way\nthat Carla Lane comedies are funny (ie. one\nlaugh every half hour and far too much misery in\nbetween).\nThree Colours White has a lot of style\nfunny or even slightly amusing.\nIf you go to see this film make sure you have\na few before you go - trust me it'll be worth the\ninvestment.\nd lh Opens today.

    "content": "Opinion 15\nEditorial Credits\nSmoking Policy\nIt seems that more and more places are\nenforcing no smoking policies and, at the\nmoment, the Union seems to be sitting back and\ndoing nothing. A while ago, the College brought\nin a smoking policy, which was a start, but it\ndoes have some strange quirks, like the Physics\nfoyer. I 've walked through there many times and\nam amazed that anyone could have even thought\nto allocate the area at the bottom of the stairs for\nsmokers. Many other departments force the\nsmokers outside, why was Physics any different?\nMost restaurants have separate smoking and\nnon-smoking areas, but can you have a meal in\nDa Vinci's or sit in the JCR for half an hour\nwithout having to breathe in other people's cigarette smoke? In Da Vinci's, there are signs\nabove the counters asking people not to smoke\nat the serving counters, but there is nothing done\nabout providing somewhere for people to sit and\neat without the off-putting smell of cigarette\nsmoke. It isn't like there is somewhere else that\nnon-smokers can go, is it.\nEven the ICU Cinema allows smoking.\nAdmittedly it's only in the back five rows, but\nmost cinemas now don't allow smoking\nanywhere. Why should the ICU Cinema be any\ndifferent? The smoke still drifts around the room\nand I'm sure I am not the only one who finds it\nunpleasant to have to put up with it.\nIsn't it about time that something was done\nabout all of this. As is mentioned in the article\non page 5, the Union can be mandated to do\nsomething if it is submitted as a motion to a Union General Meeting; the next one is on 17th June. The deadline for motions is 6pm today, so\nit's not too late to do something about it. A motion about smoking was submitted and passed\nby a UGM a while ago forbidding smoking at\nany Union meetings. I'm not sure if this is still\nin operation, as Union policy only lasts for three\nyears. But it would be a start if students could\nget the Union to do something about providing\nsmoking and non-smoking areas within Da\nVinci's and the JCR. I can't believe that\nsmokers are in the majority within the College,\nso don't non-smokers have a right to some areas\nthat are free of cigarette smoke?\nSubmitting Letters\nJust a quick reminder that if you want a letter\npublished, you must show your swipe card or\nUnion card to prove authorship of the letter\nwhen you submit it. If you submit the letter by\npost or by fax, the same applies - you must\nbring in proof, otherwise I cannot print the letter.\nIt's Pleasing To\nDear Beccy,\nSimon Baker has gone too far this time!

I went to Oxford hoping to enjoy\nthe academic side but it turned out to be one of\nthese classic cases - having been top of the class\nat school, I then found I was pretty much bottom\nof the class at college. At school, I was given a lot of encouragement and support by the\nteachers but, at university, I found myself\nsomewhere where I basically had lectures\nto go to, which is as good as reading a book because you couldn't ask questions.\nI chose to study physics because I was\ngood at it at school and I didn't really\nknow of anything else. What I wish I'd done is taken a year off, gone out and\nspent a bit of time in the world and then\ndecided what I wanted to do at university.\nBut, then again, if I were to say that I'd do\nthings differently, I probably wouldn't be\nwhere I am now and instead I'd be\nworking somewhere as an electronic\nengineer or a sound technician.\nwhat did you do after\nuniversity?\nI left university with a rather poor\ndegree thinking: \"That's it, I 've had my\nfill of education.\" The first thing I did was\nworking in a department store over the\nChristmas period. I had never done the sort\nof Saturday jobs that most people did\nwhen I was younger - my grandmother\nlived with us and I used to spend a lot of\ntime nursing her. After working at the\nstore, I did a secretarial course and did a bit of work as a secretary. I was abysmal at\nit! Having done that, though, it gives you\nso much more respect. You might have\nthese high flying ideas but, if you don't have someone who keeps their feet on the\nground, who knows exactly what's going on and\nis keeping everything in order, you're lost. I also\nworked on Radio Humberside, gofer ing making the tea, answering the telephone and\nbasically following everybody around. I befriended people and would go and watch what\nthey did; I did that for seven weeks.\nI then went for the milk round again. Looking\nback, maybe it wasn't the best thing to do, going\nto the milk round with a poor degree. People look\nat you along with everybody else and the first\nthing they see is your degree result.\n/\ns that when you started working\nfor the BBC?\nI applied to the BBC in various capacities -as a journalist, an engineer, a technical operator\nand I didn't get any of them, so I gave up on the\nBBC. At that stage, I knew I was interested in\nsound and electronics and anything that brought\nthese together. But they weren't interested in\nme. So I did a computer aptitude test and was\noffered a job as a computer programmer. So, I and weekends - I really enjoyed it and got to\nknow how everything worked. I think the BBC\nthought that if you were prepared to stay up all\nnight to work in the theatre, you must be\ninterested. They were very much more\nconcerned that you had potential, a logical mind\nand the fact that you were interested rather than\nif you knew all your stuff already. That suited\nme down to the ground; I knew I was interested,\nI just didn't have the appropriate qualifications\nto prove it. They took me on. The course I did\nwas a mixture of lectures, training\ncourses and practicals at the BBC's Training Centre, with apprenticeship\nwork on location. I loved it. Six months\nlater, I was selected to lecture about\nbroadcast engineering (I had got a reputation as being a bit of a chatterbox!)\nas part of a high prestige lecture tour to\nsixth former s. This was hard work - you\nwould have to stand up in front of up to\n2,000 young people and stick to your\nscript fairly well to fit in with everybody\nelse. I learnt a lot about cuing, tapes and\nso on and I also learnt about how to cope\nwith the embarrassment when things\ndon't do what you expect them to - very\ngood training for Tomorrow's World! I did this during the Autumn and Spring\nterms and, at Christmas, I went back to\nBroadcasting House and worked the\nnight shifts. I felt I was having a little\nholiday from doing the real work which\nwas the engineering; I was looking\nforward to getting back to it.\nH ow did you get into\npresenting on television?\nKate Bellingham, presenter of Tomorrow's World\nworked in Macclesfield, Cheshire for three years\nin this capacity. I found that I would wake up in\nthe morning and think about what I was doing at\n6 o 'clock at night. I then saw that the BBC were\nadvertising for electronic engineers. As long as\nyou had a degree, it didn't matter what the\ndegree was, they'd train you up. They were quite\nkeen to recruit people from a variety of\nbackgrounds, not just those who'd been through\nthe electronic engineering sausage machine. At\nmy interview with the BBC, I talked about the\nvoluntary work I had done at the Royal\nExchange Theatre, Manchester as part of the\nsound crew. I used to work there on evenings\nThe opportunity to present a programme for Schools TV came up -they wanted women with a genuine\ntechnical background to present the\nscience/technical programmes for secondary\nschools. I went for the audition - I had never\nstood in front of a camera before, it was\nhilarious. I had a whale of a time; I smiled and\ngiggled a lot and they offered me the job. Some\nof the work was in the studio and there were also\nfilming trips. My first trip was to Japan for two\nweeks. I was so green, I had no concept of why\nyou wear make-up to go on camera. In fact, I had no make-up with me and the cameraman\ntook me to buy some. The powder I still use is\nthe Japanese powder that I bought when I was\nout there.\nThen, the job at Tomorrow's World came up.\nThe College smoking policy is under the spotlight on page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 5\nCloud Control\nCollege smoking policy is breaking\ndown in Physics and the JCR\nThere is a story that a Japanese tourist, on a recent visit to an affluent Australian city,\nremarked to his guide on the high class of the\nprostitutes who frequented the street corners of\nthe business district. It was explained to him th it\nthese were not prostitutes but executives and\nsecretaries, forced by Draconian corporate health\ninitiatives to take their ii^o tine hit out on the\npavement.\nThe Imperial College Smoking Policy came\ninto effect in October. 1991 With the aim of\nensuring that students and Staff could go about\ntheir business ma smoke-free environment. \"In\nsome ways what you do is move the problem\nsomewhere else.\" admits John Payne, Employee\nRelations Manager and a member of the working\nparty which drew up the policy. \"If you close\ndown one smoking area the smokers will go off\nsome w hue else and then it gets worse in those\nareas than it was before.\" He perhaps has in\nmind the Huxley end of the cross-campus\nwalkway, regularly wreathed in smoke and\ncarpet c sh after Maths lectures. \"I can\nappreciate why there is a smoking ban,\" says\nTom Griffeth, one of a group of smokers\nstanding just outside the level three entrance to\nthe Huxley Building. \"But it would be better to\nhave a smoking area in the Maths department,\"\nadds fe tine refugee Karl I.lo yd. \"Sf||||i||||i: l not be p| \u00a7|\u00a7ff||\u00a7|ii\ncirculation areas such as lifts, corridors, toilets\nand reception areas,\" states die College policy.\nWhile the Maths department carries out the letter\nif not i ho spirit of this guideline, the Physics\ndepartment does neither. The un enclosed smoking area is situated in the foyer stairwell.\nSo, by a physical process known as 'diffusion',\nsmoke drifts fie ely' and is often very noticeable\nto anyone passing through the entrance hall.\nJames Gibb, the departmental supervisor,\nacknowledges that the\nsituation is not ideal: \" i hate smoking myself\u2022>KT<es i.ge f;i whiff of it corning down\nfire-risk as his main\n|\u00a7|)j ect ion to an enclosed,\n^unsupervised smoking\nroom. Among the fair\n|||||||er of those crossing:\nfile foyer who turned out\ntd be smokers, none\nminded the idea of a separate smoking room,\nbut most drew the line at\nbeing turned out onto the\nstreet.\nAny fleeting discomfort experienced while entering Physics,\nhowever, is nothing compared to the effect of\nthe unchecked miasma in the JCR. Attempts\nhave been made to make the vicinity of the QT\nSnack Bar a no-smoking area, but without\nsuccess - all the signs have been removed.\nJames Woolven, manager of the QT, says he has\nsuffered intimidation from groups of smokers\nwhen he has asked them to move away. Rose, a non-smoking cashier, says it does bother her\nwhen people smoke near the tills and would like\nto see permanent signs put up next to the QT.\nAgain, most people didn't seem to mind the idea\nof separate smoking and non-smoking areas.\n\"Half-and-half would be quite understandable,\"\nsaid Irfan Kausar from Elcc Eng, a smoker who\nis trying to give up. \"I don't mind what the\npolicy is as long as 1 know what's happening.\"\nThe group of smokers flaunting their fags a few feet from the curry bar, who genuinely\nseemed to believe they should be allowed to\nThe open-plan smoking area in the Physics department foyer JC tar: there is no provision to protect users and staff of the JCR\ncurry bar from the effects of passive smoking\nsmoke anywhere, were in a minority. They point\nout that people can always go somewhere else,\nand, as far as the students in the JCR are\nconcerned, this is true, at least at lunchtime. But\nthe College staff who work there have no such\noption; nor at the moment is any attempt being\nmade to protect them from passive smoking.\nJackie staffs the curry bar (on the opposite side\nof the room to the QT, making half-and-half\nsegregation difficult) and has seen people come\nup to be served while still smoking. Although a smoker herself, she finds this un hygienic and\nfeels there should be signs up prohibiting\nsmoking near the food.\nThe health and safety of College catering\nstaff is the responsibility of the catering\ndepartment. Simon Westerman, College\nCatering Manager, stated that he had not\npreviously been aware of a problem in the JCR,\nbut after being acquainted with the current\nsituation, he acknowledged that the catering\narrangements in the JCR would have to be\nreviewed. The problem is that the JCR, being a student facility, is administered by the Union\nduring term-time. Since the Union has no policy\non smoking, it can't do anything constructive\nuntil the Executive have drawn one up and had it\npassed at a Union General Meeting.\nIt seems odd that an issue that has such\npotentially damaging consequences for the\nCollege should be left to the whims of student\npolitics. The Health and Safety at Work Act\n1974 states that employers have to ensure, so far\nas is reasonably practicable, the health, safety\nand welfare at work of all their employees. In\n1993, a local government employee received\n\u00a315,000 in an out-of-court settlement, after her\nhealth had been allegedly damaged by passive\nsmoking at work.\nPatrick Wood\nFurther to enquiries made by Felix, the smoking\narrangements in the JCR are to be discussed at\nthis Monday's meeting of the Union Executive.\nAn interview with Kate Bellingham can be found on pages 6 & 7\n\n"

    "content": "14 Feature\nEducational Reality\nImperial College was ranked the top engineering\ninstitution in England by the first Times Guide\nto Universities, displacing both Cambridge and\nOxford into an unthinkable second and third\nplace. They did manage to redeem themselves,\nhowever, with a tie at first place (along with\nImperial, of course) for the sciences. Our\nprestigious establishment is a home for high\nflyers and academic excellence, which has no\ndouble given it quite a reputation. Imperial\nCollege - wow! A first class - double wow! In\nshort, a passport to success.\nI came an idealistic youth (now I'm just\nidealistic), hoping to find something that would\nfascinate me enough that I'd consider making a career out of it. Both the fist and second year\nwere shoved down the throat faster than I could\nswallow - you can taste it later kid, just gotta get\nfattened up a little first. Here I am in the third\nand final year, beaming with triumph; I can do\nwhat I want now.\nYep, there's options this year. Oh, wow! We\ncan all do what we really, really want. Then\nagain, if you're among those who don't know\nwhat to do - never mind, just do what's easy\nsince it doesn't matter does it? Why make life\ndifficult, right? You have to be realistic, you\nknow.\nFunny thing, unless there's something wrong\nwith that logic, it seems quite a few of us don't really know what we want because easy is the in\nthing. Because when it's easy, you get a first.\nBecause that's what we're here for - graduating\ncum laude. You have to realistic, you know.\nIt's not a bad system, exams are necessary,\ngrade streaming is necessary. We all need to\nknow who has quality, since that's a precious\ncommodity. How many of you have been turned\noff by something that was somewhat interesting\nbecause it might be hard to score or perhaps it\nwould consume too much time or maybe there\naren't any past papers (risky new course!) or\nbecause it is just plain difficult. How many of us\nwould jeo pardi sea first class degree for some\ninteresting or useful (which does lose its appeal\nif you flunk it) course - if we were in such a position. A very big zero I would think. You\nhave to be realistic, you know.\nA first class isn't everything (well, maybe a bit more important than what's interesting, but it\nreally isn't everything). An easy thing to say if\nyou've already secured that first or maybe if its\nwell nigh impossible. But, if you were kind of\nteetering on it, or perhaps just fearful then it is a whole new ball game. You can't just take what\nyou like - so much for 'options'. It's not\nsomething that anyone addresses seriously at all.\nWe're all told to pick what interests us, right?\nBut behind that nodding facade, what manner of\nforce drives us? Maybe it doesn't really matter\nwhat we do now, since what we do later on\nwould be totally different. If that's the case then\nImperial College is doing a great job churning\nout exam experts. In any case, the inclusion of\ncourse works and projects attempts to create\nmore of a balance, though I'm sure it is not\nsomething all of us agree upon - except when it\nis easy points, of course.\nWhich brings me to the point that if it would\nbe at all possible, College would alter the grade\ncontribution/distribution/allocation in order that\nthe students would be more motivated to select\nan option they were interested in as opposed to\none they could score in. A simple suggestion\nwould be to reduce the contributing percentage\nof option courses. This assumes that since these\ncourses do not affect grades very much, there\nwould be a greater inclination to take risks, like\ndoing an interesting course. The implications are\nof course unclear as to whether it is truly\nbeneficial to us students since it means that we\nhave to perform well in compulsory courses,\nwhich may be quite difficult, which of course\nmeans it is harder to get a first.\nSo, which has top priority? To get the highly\nacclaimed first class honours or to do something\ninteresting? \"Both!\", I hear some of you cry.\nWell, it is clear they can sometimes exhibit\nmutual exclusivity.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies\nTWF Support Peruvian Nursery\nThe Third World First Latin American Night in\nthe Union Building on the 17th June is the third\nevent of its kind; the previous two have been\nimmensely successful. All the proceeds will go\nto the Westnell Nursery in Lima, Peru. This\narticle describes the nursery and its vital role in\nthe shanty towns of Lima.\nIn Lima, as with most other Third World\nNations, the migration of people from the rural\nto the urban areas has led to shanty housing on\nthe periphery of the city. Many of these areas are\nwithout basic sanitation and amenities and the\nstandard of living is very low. many people have\nlittle or no education and earn a living in the\ninformal or service sector earning less than the\nminimum wage. In many families, both parents\nwork and the children are expected to be\neconomically active at a very young age. These\nsocial and economic difficulties are compounded\nby the political violence in Peru. Many people\nhave limited civil and political rights and live in\nconstant fear for their lives.\nQuality education is a way of improving the\nemployment prospects of children growing up in\nsuch an environment. Pre-school education,\nhowever, is accorded a low priority in the\nPeruvian state sector, yet children are obliged to\nsit a basic skills test before being granted\nadmission into the primary school system. Low\nincome parents thus face difficulties in educating\ntheir children due to the costly nature of preschool uniforms and materials.\nThe Westnell Nursery was set up to\ncircumvent many of the above problems; it was\nfounded in 1986 by two English volunteers and\nhas since given 650 pre-school educational\nplaces to children from Doscientas Millas, 25 de\nFebrero and Boca Negra - three of the poorest\nshanty towns.in Lima. The broad goal of the\nnursery is to provide a good foundation for\nschool entry at age six. This would include the\nability to think imaginatively and creatively and\nto communicate both individually and as part of\na group. The Westnell Nursery is free to all\nchildren in the community and overalls,\nmaterials and a nutritious snack are provided.\nChildren are encouraged to take pride in their\ncommunity; indigenous cultural traditions are\nrespected and a sense of history is encouraged.\nThe staff themselves are from economically\ndisadvantaged backgrounds and so have an\nunderstanding of the challenges the families\nface. Educated parents are more likely to educate\ntheir children, so staff work with parents on\nparenting skills. There are also adult education\nclasses for women.\nThe nursery continues to achieve many of its\noriginal aims and has also become a focal point\nfor the community: when political and social\nallegiances have divided the town, the nursery\nunites people through its un partisan concern for\ntheir children. Its success has not been without\ntrauma though - in July 1992 a bomb was\nplanted by the 'Shining Path', very close to the\nnursery, causing considerable damage.\nIn the UK, the Westnell Society is a registered charity, and financial support comes\nfrom fundraising events in the UK and\nindividual covenanters. This does not, however,\ncompromise the autonomy of the organisation in\nPeru, which is managed by a staff and parent\ncommittee. Sadly, supply can never equal\ndemand and it is felt there is a need for similar\nprojects in other shanty towns. It is not certain\nwhether the model of the nursery can simply be\nreplicated in another town, but the management\nteam in Lima have proposed a satellite project in\nthe shanty town of Boca Negra. This is a community with even fewer material resources\nthan the current site and no pre-school provision.\nThe Latin Party on 17th June will provide the\ncharity with an opportunity to raise money for\nthis much needed expansion programme.\nDramSoc Presents: Equus\nReligious worship takes on strange forms. The\nboy kneels before a picture of a horse taken from\nhis father's print shop. It is up on his bedroom\nwall in the place where a picture of Christ had\nonce been: Christ in pain, Christ physically\nbeaten and on his way to Calvary. That picture\nhad been violently ripped down by the boy's father in some sort of Marxist rage (\"Religion's at the bottom of this!\"). It is replaced by the\nhorse god, Equus, and the symbolism and ritual\nof Christianity are permuted into a worship of\nhorses.\nThis is no teenage fad; jodhpurs and\ngym khan as are the enemy. Even when given the\nopportunity, the boy doesn't want to ride a horse. He kneels down in his pyjamas late at\nnight and recites the words of his creed: 'And\nNeckwus begat Fleckwus, the King of spit. And\nFleckwus spoke out of his Chinkle-Chankle:\n\"Behold I give you Equus, my only begotten\nson.'\" - phrases taken from the Bible and\nperversely adapted. The worship ends with the\nboy physically beating himself.\nThis is the heart of Peter Schaffer's play\nEquus. But the play does a lot more than just\npaint this rather perverse scene. We are first\nintroduced to the boy in the psychiatrist's office.\nHe is there for an evaluation: he has blinded six\nhorses by taking their eyes out with a hoof-pick.\nIs he the enemy of horses? The psychiatrist is\ncharged with finding out why and, through his\nnarrative, we examine the boy's life as it leads\nup to the blinding s. The play paints vivid portraits of a relentlessly self-improving old type socialist\nfather and a simple religious mother who is\nbaffled by her son's 'troubles'. Religion is an\nobvious source of conflict and, although the\nchild's malaise seems to express itself through\nsome corrupt religious fer v our, we soon gather\nthat darker forces are lurking...\nMy personal interpretation: \"It's the god of\nold-style socialist hypocrisy that's at the bottom\nof this!\"\nEquus will be performed 18th and 19th June\nin the Union Lounge (Union Building, Beit\nQuad). \u00a33 (\u00a32 students). Tickets will be on sale\non the door.\nReviews of Serial Mom and Three Colours White are on page 11\n\n"

If I am dumb beside your\nbody while silence blossoms like tumours on our\nlips, it is because I hear a man climb the stairs\nand clear his throat outside our door. \" So\nLeonard Cohen speaks as a piano starts and we\nshyly inch from his poem into the ariel words of\nTori Amos' 'Silent All These Years'.\nLive cuts culled from LA station KCRW, this\ncompilation, 'Rare On Air Vol. 1', calls my\nname gently for a first half of Peter Himmelman,\nMichael Penn, Juliana & Evan (that rhymes with\nheaven) and Beck.\nThe second half trails its tail in the mud but\nto finish a 'various artists' album with new\nnames to whisper in the the heat of passion,\n\"you make such a cool distraction\",\ndemonstrates that the first volume of a series had\nfulfilled itself. (7) Tintin\nAmerica, checked shirts, guitars...you've\nheard it all before a thousand times but still they\nkeep coming. Actually, it isn't quite fair to tar\nVanilla Trainwreck and their album\n'Mordecai' with this brush. They've been\ndelivering albums regularly ever since their self-financed tape debut of 1989 and the guitars and\nshirts are about as close as they get to the US\nindie mainstream.\nWhile labelmates such as Juliana Hatfield\nhave hit the big time, fame has always eluded\nthem but then again they've never really tried\ntoo hard. It's difficult to pin down their sound.\nYou listen to a track, think you've got it and\nthen the next is completely different. There's the\nbrooding intensity of 'Alex' and 'Nothing I Suppose', the deranged melody of 'Quagmire'\nand the surging guitars of 'Pink Smoke',\nreminiscent of Sub Pop's new stars Hazel. And\nthen there's 'Sister' with its infectious tune that\njust won't get out of your head. It's quite\nimpossible to sum up, which makes it all the\nmore interesting to listen to. (8) Ridley Dash\nAnother offering from the Aussie folk-rock ster s, Wedding Parties and Anything and\ntheir album Kingtide, a worthy successor to\n'Difficult Loves' which came out here only a few months ago. Poignant snapshots of the\nunderside of life, love and social commentary\nare accompanied by down-to-earth language, all\nwith the distinctive vocals of Mike Thomaspoet, philosopher and mainstay of the band. The\nband themselves are accomplished and reliable,\nslipping from the REMish to the Cajunish, via\nCeltic sounds and the obvious influence of\nKilburn (where some of the songs were\nrecorded) and its folk y Irishness.\nThis is the music of the Australian new man,\nbar-room philosopher with plenty of soul-bearing and 'person-of-the-world' advice.\nMaybe it's an acquired taste but one with plenty\nto sav our. Even the weaker tracks like 'The Rain\nIn My Heart' and 'Stalactites' hold the listener\nuntil the next flash of brilliance. Get hold of it\nand broaden your tastes. (8) Al\nThe release of Strobe's third album, 'The\nCircle Never Ends' sees them add a female\nvocalist, an extra guitar and a second\npercussionist, giving them a much broader\nsound. They're still mainly like the psychedelic\nguitar rock reminiscent of Hawkwind, Loop and\nSpaceman 3 but, to this, they have incorporated\nambient tribal sound, heavy hypnotic rock and\nhard-hitting industrial riffs. This is cool\nbackground music but unfortunately it goes on a bit too long for its own good. Strobe do all the\nright things but lack that extra ingredient needed\nto make it stand out. (7) Mr Happy\nFrom the staring eyes of Gano, Ritchie and\nHoffman to their avant-garde waywardness, the\nViolent Femmes can be a daunting proposition\nand so it is in their album, 'New Times'. It's not\nthat they can't play great songs which draw you\nin to stamp your feet and clap hands. No, the\nproblem is they just don't wanna do it like that;\ntoo clever by measures.\nThe lyrics are to blame, of course. You can't use phrases like \"the poets they still had to muse\nover the classicism of clean shoes\" or \"it was\neither take over the world or learn French\" and\nhope to produce any melody, sweet or\notherwise. And when they were reduced to every\nthird line being \"I see that she is pretty\" in the\ndeeply ironic 'Mirror, Mirror', I wondered if the\nirony was so deep it was imaginary.\nThe singular leap from reason, when it did\ncome, was necessarily sparkling. 'Jesus of Rio'\ncharts the world summit through a seedy liaison\nin Copenhagen. Saving the world or getting a quick feelgood? The Violent Femmes leave it\n'til last to show they know there's a difference.\n(6) Tintin\nPrimal Scream - 'Jailbird': From a riff which\nwants to be a Harley Davidson when it grows\nup, a deep down fried Southern Chicken rib of a song gets hewn. Spicy outside, raw inside, but\nmake sure you get it while it's hot. Tintin\nSepultura - 'Slave New World': The Brazilians\nthrash gods spew forth yet another exquisitely\nbrutal single from last year's stunning 'Chaos\nAD'. This one'11 eat your flesh faster fn an you\ncan say 'necro tis in gfa sci it is'. The perfect\nsoundtrack for bloody revolution, but plush\npackaging doesn't excuse another rope y selection of b sides. Freddy Cheeseworth\nRev Horton Heat - 'Caliente'l Supersuckers'400 Bucks': The Rev does the Supersuckers on\nsome speeding tickets left by rockabilly and the\n'Suckers do the Rev with a five-line whip on\nguitars. Take your pick but in my book the\nFotheringham cover (as above and below) wins\nbottles up. Tintin\nOpus III - 'When You Made The Mountain': A six-track remix ep from the tr an cy techno heads best known for their absurdly catchy 'It's A Fine Day'.

Prince is a little shy so he only does the\nbacking vocals while Terence dominates the\nlead guitar.

    "content": "News\nStudent\nDebt to\nIncrease\nRector Replies to Petition\nHalls in Evelyn Gardens, where some residents are protesting over lack of common room space.\nMany students will fall into debt as\nsoon as they arrive at university\nthis year, according to the National\nUnion of Students (NUS).\nThe NUS has predicted that\nmany universities will raise accommodation fees by more than the\ncurrent rate of inflation. This may\npush fees above the level of the full\nstudent grant, meaning students\nwould have to have other funding\nto be able to pay them. Some\nobservers have predicted that large\nnumbers of students will be forced\ninto taking out an overdraft or loan\nin order to survive throughout the\nearly part of the year.\nThe predictions come after the\nGovernment's announcement\nearlier this year that it is to cut the\nlevel of student grants by 10%\nannually, starting from September.\nJim Murphy, the NUS\nPresident-elect, sees the problem as\ngetting worse: \"With a further grant\ncut of 20% over the next two years,\nsome students will soon be lucky if\nthey can even afford two terms'\nrent without borrowing.\"\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nThe Rector has replied in an open\nletter to protests from residents of\ntwo Evelyn Gardens halls over lack\nof common room space.\nResidents of Holbein and Willis\nJackson halls organised a petition in\nprotest at the inadequate combined\ncommon room facilities for both\nhalls.\nThe petition came after the\nCollege failed to act following\ncomplaints to the Housing\nCommittee and a letter of protest in\nFelix 996.\nThe Rector's reply has been\ndescribed by one student as promis-ing, but as yet no definite action has\nbeen taken by the College.\nFunding Cuts Attacked\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe Government's higher education\nfunding policy came under fire\nfrom employers this week.\nA report released on Monday by\nthe Confederation of British\nIndustry (CBI) warns the\nGovernment that \u00a33 billion must be\nfound to increase the number of\nuniversity places.\nIt says that the Government's target of 33% of young people\ngoing into higher education must be\nraised to 40% if British business is\nto compete with the rest of the\nworld. \"Economic success depends\nmore than ever on the brain power and creativity of the workforce.\"\nThe report comes after a paper\npublished by the Committee of\nVice-Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) in May detailed a drop in\nuniversity funding (Felix 1001). It\nsaid that funding per student has\nbeen cut by 25% over the last four\nyears, and predicted a further\nreduction of 14% during the next\nthree.\nThe CBI has criticised the\nreduction: \"It means higher\neducation is being rationed and -though we appreciate the\nGovernment's motives - in our\n.view it is a mistake.\"\nThe report also suggested that\nuniversities could sustain an annual\n4% \"efficiency gain\" until the end\nof the century.\nThis view is not shared by the\nChairman of the CVCP, Dr Kenneth\nEdwards. Speaking to a CBI\nconference on higher education on\nMonday, he said: \"it would create a system with high dropout rates,\nunable to give the individual\nattention needed to ensure that\nstudents develop not only agile and\ncreative minds, but also core skills\nand a commitment to continuing\nself-learning.\"\nThe Association of University\nTeachers has controversially stated\nits opposition to any further cuts:\n\"Unlike the CBI and the vice-chancellors we are willing to say\npublicly that the quality of the\nlearning experience available to our\nstudents has suffered as a result of\nunder-resourced expansion.\nIt is time to drop the pretence\nthat it is possible to reduce funding\nper student year after year without\nany effect on the quality of\neducation they receive. The damage\nthat has been done to our universities\nis a national scandal. It should be\nthe subject of an independent\nreview so that the true condition of\nour universities can be properly\nassessed before we embark on any\nmore cut-price expansion.\"\nSelf\nDefence\nClasses\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nIn the wake of several robbery s and attacks on students and staff\nmembers, Imperial College\nSecurity are planning to improve\nfacilities for self-defence training\nin College.\nCurrently, the Police are holding\nself-defence classes in the gym in\nthe Union building. College\nSecurity are intending to try and\nfind funding for the purchase of a heavy suit and punch bags for\npeople to practice on.\nThe classes, for both men and\nwomen, will be advertised around\nCollege.\nThis week's Elimination is on the back page\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 7\nThe current Tomorrow's World team\nIt turned out that they were quite keen to have a woman with a strong technical background.\nApparently, I looked and sounded a bit like\nMaggie Philbin in her youth. They wanted me to\njoin at the start of February, when I was six\nweeks away from my final exams to become a qualified BBC engineer. I thought it was a bit\ntoo rushed - a bit like going off to become a model a week before your A levels. In the end, I worked on Tomorrow's World from February to\nJune and did a summer course to get my\nqualification. That was four years ago.\nJIThat are the things you enjoy\nVV about presenting Tomorrow s World?\nIt is a chance to see things, go to places and\nmeet people that you'd never normally have the\nchance to do. There is an element of being paid\nfor things that you'd love to do for a hobby if\nyou ever had the chance to do them like, for\nexample, trying out virtual reality, meeting\nsomebody in the states who's had really\npioneering surgery to help her hearing.\nNormally, you'd just read about it or see it on\nTV, but I'm actually there, meeting these people.\ns there anything which you dislike\nabout it?\nPeople often say to me: \"You must love the\nglamour, the posh events, travelling the world,\nbeing treated like a star.\" In fact, it's quite an\neffort for me to do all the dressing up although,\nof course, I recognise the importance of it. This\nis perhaps reflected by my background - this is\nnever what I intended to do, it just happened. I still catch the bus to work, I like to cycle and I can't be bothered to wear make-up. The\ntravelling is fun, but it's not like having a holiday everytime you go away, its just another\nhotel in another city.\nT\\ id you used to watch\nLJ Tomorrow's World before you\nbegan presenting it and what do you\nlike watching on television?\nI used to watch Tomorrow's World regularly,\nand remember watching Judith when I was\nyounger. I enjoy watching drama and escapism\nstuff like Middlemarch, Morse and other\nmysteries. I also like good documentaries such\nas Horizon and QED.\nDo you watch yourself\nTomorrow's World?\non\nAlways, yes. When you are actually doing it,\nthings can get really out of proportion. I once\nremember when I felt I had a real coughing fit\nand I thought I didn't put my hand in front of my\nmouth. When I watched it later, I realised that I had just cleared my throat. You get hyped and\nsomething little happens, you can end up\nthinking it was the most important thing in the\nworld.\nH ow do you decide what to\nfeature on the show?\nWe have a large team - people scan the\npapers and specialist magazines, from Plastics\nAnd Rubber Weekly through to Farmers' World.\nAlso, people write in with their ideas. These are\nall put together to make a varied show.\n/\ns there any item featured, that for\nyou, stands out from the rest?\nWe do so many items and part of the nature\nof Tomorrow's World is that we only skim the\nsurface of so many things and can't get too\ndeeply involved. The virtual reality sticks in my\nmind, where I had the chance to experience\nsomething that nobody else has.\nTTThat is your target audience,\nVV and how do you know if you\nare reaching them?\nSurveys have been done and they've shown\nthat we appeal to quite a large age range. It is\nunusually balanced across the age groups, social\ngrouping, male/female and so on, although the\nlast survey was done before we were put in the\nslot opposite Coronation Street, so it might have\nchanged.\nOur target audience is everybody really. We\ntry to appeal to the person who has an interest in\nscience but no scientific background, but also to\nthose who have strong scientific backgrounds.\nThey should not feel that we are short changing\nthe audience and certainly they should not feel\nthat we are telling any untruths. We might\nsimplify things, but we hope we never trivial is e them or get things wrong. We check everything\nwe put out through various sources.\nThe Book Of Ultimate Truths is reviewed on page 10\n\n"
