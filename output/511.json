The race, between an Executive team and an\nICWA team, is made more arduous by the simultaneous\n\"testing\" of the Union Building's fire hoses. The referee for the\nevent is traditionally the FELIX Editor, who completes the final\nlap in case he/she has managed to remain dry until then!\nThe water started flowing at noon. Hoses by the main\nentrance and from the Dramsoc vantage point, outside their\nstore-room, covered the front of the Union Building, while the\nresidents of new Beit, armed with saucepans and waste-paper\nbaskets showered bystanders on the South side of the quad.\nTansy Hepton had a hose to herself in the entrance to the Union\nBar, but the Botany and Zoology sides remained dry. This was\nprobably due to the fact that this year onlookers were kept off\nthe roofs.\nThe race itself started fifteen minutes late at 12:45. Daphne\nWebsper and Mark Corrigan were the first to run: the course\nbeing one complete circuit of the quad starting from and\nreturning to the centre. In addition to the hoses, one of the\nhazards encountered on the route was a dustbin-wielding\nBruce Willis.\nICWA cheated first by taking a short-cut to one corner of the\nquad from the centre. Their advantage was lost, though, when\nsome of the Exec, team \"held-up\" the ICWA runners by Beit\nArchway. Despite a pact between Daphne and Andy Lewis to\ndead-heat, ICWA finished first. The race is, however,\ntraditionally a draw since both teams usually manage to get\ndisqualified.\nAfter the event the two teams retired for a shower and\npancakes before the Exec, left for the U GM at 1:30 p.m. One\nlate-comer, Mr. Ron Nash of the Nat. West Bank, thinking it was\nsafe to enter the quad was duly drenched and has sworn that he\n\"will kill the bastards that soaked him on Tuesday.\" He knows\nMark Corrigan and Andy Lewis were involved.

    "content": "Page 2!\nDear John. Following the article\nconcerning Liberal Students on\nthe back page of FELIX last\nweek. I feel a lew points need some\nclarification.\nI certainly do not believe in\nvoluntary memberships ol\nstudent unions within the\nframework of society as it is\npresently structured, but such a concept is perfectly compatible\nwith Liberal principles ol\nindividual freedom of choice.\nClearly such principles have to be\ncompromised with the equally\nvalid principle of collective\nresponsibility, and at present the\nlatter must surely be the\ndominant factor.\nLiberal policies should always\nbe seen in the context of striving\nfor an ideal Liberal society - and\nI stress 'ideal' - and I believe that\neventually, if enough progress can\nbe made, voluntary membership\nof student unions would fit neatly\ninto such a new society structure\nwith far more emphasis on, freedom of choice lor individuals.\nAt present, however, it would\nIKcompletely unworkable, and\nstudent unions would no! be able\nlo provide the wide range ol\nsporting, recreational, representational and other services which\nthey do now. and would cease to\nexist in any effective manner. I'd be happy to elaborate on this at a later date, but I thought it\nimportant to clarify my position -and indeed Liberal Students'\nposition - now. before any\nmisunderstanding could arise.\nYours sincerely.\nSheyne Lucock\nSir. - Iam prompted to write, by\nthe article on the back page of\ntoday's edition concerning the\nfunding of Student Unions 'a matter of great concern to FELIX itself. I am sure).\nIt would appear from your\narticle that an officer of the\nImperial College Union, indeed\nthe incumbent of a post which I once filled myself, and one who\naspires to high responsibilities,\nhas been advocating the policies\nof Mrs. Thatcher and a minority\nof the Conservative Party, of\nwhich I believe he is not a member ( Iam prepared to Incorrected in this belief).\nIt might at first appear\ninconsistent lor an individual of\nlibertarian convictions, such as\nmyself, to oppose the concept of a \"closed shop\" in industry, but to\nsupport an apparently similar\nsituation in the student community. But such a comparison would be unrealistic.\nThe Students' Union is not only a representational body, and in\nthat role it is not easily\ndemarcated from the administration of the College. It is, however,\nmore e as il v \"detachable\" as the\nprincipal source of social and\nsporting life at IC.\nOne may be able to remain\naloof from the \" political\" activities of ICU and apathetic\ntowards the sports and recreational clubs, but I would\nopine (posh, prose, eh, John?) that\neach member of a community has\nan obligation to contribute\ntowards the facilities provided lor\nthe whole community; and as the\nAmerican Revolution was\nsupposed to prove, those\ncontributions are inseparable\nfrom the representation of the\ncontributors.\nCan one evaluate either (a) the\nmarginal cost of providing the\nfacilities per additional student\n(alter capital expenditure on such\nitems as the Union building,\ncommon rooms. Sports Centre.\nBoathouse. their fixtures and\nprovision of heat, light, etc. to\nthem; or the Ln ion print unit -how much would you charge for\nFELIX to non-members. John?)\nor (b) the mean cost per student ol\nthe entirety? If so. which of these\ndoes Mr. Lucock propose to\nseparate from tuition lees in order\nthat such a portion should Involuntary?\nThe voluntary membership of\nStudent Unions is a policy which\nhas been condemned by Liberal\nStudents for many years and\nvigorously opposed within the\nConservative Party by FCS. I have the honour. Sir, to\nremain your most obedient and\ndevoted reader,\nDerrick Everett\nSpectroscopy PG.,\nBlackett Laboratory\nDear Sir, - I certainly do not claim\nto be the world's greatest\nmathematician, but I am fairly\nsure that 6 does not equal 14.\nHowever, some people are apt to\ndisagree. Down in Southside\nRefectory, deep in the heart ol\nMooneyland, extra vegetables arc\ncharged 14 p. Fair enough, this is\nconsistent with the general high\nprices encountered there. But, if\nyou have just the meat dish and\nchips, only 6 pence is deducted\nfrom the price of your meal.\nThen, as if enough salt has not\nbeen rubbed into the deep wound\ninflicted by refectory price\npolicies, if you are fool enough (as\nI was, to substitute your cooked\nvegetable with coleslaw (which is\nonly grass and grease) another 15\np is slapped onto your meal price.\nThis means that the cost of\nlasagne, chips and coleslaw is a sky-high 80 p. the latter being an\nenormous 21 p. The consequence\nof this, of course, is that whenever\nstudents choose to eat a selection\nof food that deviates from the\nmeals listed on the price-list.\nMooney profit margins soar to\neven dizzier heights. If you\nextrapolate this 'buying and\nselling' price policy further, you\nwould expect to pay 28-p. for\nwalking past the till with an\nempty plate!\nWith such inconsistencies\nwithin and between refectory\nprices (80 p. would buy you a far\nmore wholesome meal in the\nSherfield Lower refectory) I cannot understand the mentality\nof such Mooneyphiles as Peter\nKirkham, who confessed to\nbreaking the boycott and actually\nstated in his letter to FELIX that\nhe found the quality \"quite\nreasonable\". Even without the\nissue of the use of the regulator, I have enough ill-feelings to\nsupport every future boycott the\nUnion decides to stage as will, Iam sure, the overwhelming\nmajority of I.C. students who can\ncertainly do without the likes of\nPeter Kirkham. Yours faithfully.\nMartin Sladdin\nBotany 3.\nDear Sir, - All the anti-abortionists who have put\nforward their beliefs in FELIX so\nfar have been male, and this,\ncoupled with other factors, has\nactually produced . a strong\nenough reaction in me to make\nme get oil my apathetic backside\nand fe ply. A lot of women who are\npregnant and do not wish to have\na child, do not want it from before\nthe moment it was conceived and\nwish to have it aborted as early as\npossible.\nThere is a form of abortion\ncalled Menstrual Extraction\nwhich can be carried out up to 17\ndays after a missed period. It uses\na small extraction tube (like a syringe). It is done without\nanaesthetic, and most women\nonly have a mild cramping\nsensation afterwards. It is\nnormally used before the 10th day\nthe period's late so the women\nwouldn't know if she was\npregnant anyway. So it can be\ndone without any heads being\nthrown in buckets of bits of bodies\netc.\n80% of abortions take place\nbefore 12 weeks, when the baby is\nabout 3 \" long with its knees bent\nup-II the woman does decide after\nconception that she does not want\nthe child, it is for a good reason.\nAbortion is a traumatic experience; it is not something she\nwants to go through for the sheer\nhell of it.'\nI do not like society the way it is\nand therefore believe strongly in\nnot bringing a child into this\nworld, because I wouldn't be able\nto bring it up in the way I would\nwant to. Xo woman should be\nforced to have children if she is not\ncapable of bringing them up in\nthe way she would want to. And if\nshe. doesn't want a child she is the\nlast person who should be\nbringing up part of the next\ngeneration. Over half of the\n140.000 legal abortions each year\nare carried out on single women,\nwho presumably do not feel they\nare capable of bringing a child up\nproperly.\nHave the anti-abortionists\nconsidered the case of a woman\nbecoming pregnant after rape?\nOught she to be forced to carry\nthat child for 9 months?\nFinally I object to anyone\ndeciding that it is not my right to\ndecide whether I have a child or\nnot.\nKirsten Pratt\nDear Sir, - I am referring to Jamie\nShelter's letter in FELIX510 attacking homosexuality in the\nname of the bible.\nHe admits that he couldn't see\na reason lor prohibiting homosexuality by law until he\nhad read the bible. Unfortunately\nyet another latent open-minded\nperson is forced into the s hak les of\nignorance using the fallacious\nargument of authority.\nNothing makes the bible\nabsolutely 'true'. Interpretation\nof the bible is also a matter of\npersonal perception. I believe\nthat where there is love; there is\ngood. The feelings of attraction\nwhich we cannot explain or\nunderstand are there to be\nenjoyed - if we are brave enough\nto face them.\nYours faithfully,\nMr. Raque Zaidan\n19 Linden Gardens\nLondon W2 4HD(01)2293787 Dear Sir. - I have read with\ninterest and in some cases\nannoyance the letters that have\nappeared on your pages concerning, amongst other things\nhomosexuality and abortion,\nfrom students with strong\nreligious convictions. The letter\nfrom Mr. Shotter has finally\nprompted me to make some\ncomments on the matter.\nPersonally I have no strong\nobjection to, or support for\nhomosexuality. As far as I can see\nif one blok e wants to bugger\nanother in the privacy of\nwheresoever they choose who are\nwe to obe ct? It's certainly not the\nway I would' choose to spend an\nevening but if it does not ailed me\nin any way then why should I say\n\"no. you must not do this\"? What\ndoes annoy me is Godsquad\nmembers who quote vast chunks\nof the Bible (with references),\naccompanied by comments such\nas \"look! God says you must not\ndo this\". Why is the Bible treated\nas such an absolute standard, and\nconsidered to be correct on all\nmatters, when large parts of it arc-incorrect, contradictory and\nunproven? Presumably Mr. Shotter does not believe the world\nto have been created in seven days\nso why then should he be lives. without question, that if \" a man\ncould, on page 3\n\n"

Perhaps I could he accused of dogma I ism:\nalter all. this is the third seventeenth century\nwork I have reviewed in three weeks, but it\nwas. on the other hand, a very good century\nfor plays.\nThe production is a return to the rather\nmore traditional style, with well designed\nbackdrops and a great deal of stage masking:\ngimmicks are kept to a bate minimum. Inuendos based on modern interpretation ol\nolde speech are non-existent and a genuine\napproach has been adopted, striving more\ntowards accuracy than commerce. The music\nof Stephen Oliver( Tom Jones. The Duchess\nof Mali] etc.) is subtle and manages to convey\nan atmosphere appropriate to the era and the\nvarious scenes, and confirms my belief that [\nthere is really no substitute for live music\nwritten specifically for the work in question.\nIn this play. Shakespeare's wit is keen and\nquick; so much so that by the time the\nintricacies of one line have been mentally\nsorted, there have already passed several\nmore, and this is particularly true of the\ndialogue between Jaques and Touchstone\n(once again the wit and fool due tte) played\nwith masterful skill by someone whom the\nprogramme just didn't quite- get round to\nmentioning (apparently) and Alan David\nv respectively). Touchstone even had half the\naudience joining in with the 'seven points of\nan argument\". I wasn't sure what to think\nabout that, but the fact is that at this point of\nthe play. Rosalind, who has been playing a counterfeit man. has gone oil to change,\nleaving both the characters (in the story) and\nthe audience (in fact) with nothing really\nimportant to think about. Hence Touchstone, in line with his profession,\ncommences to entertain both (so much that\nJaques, who must have been through it all\nmany times before, had difficulty getting his\nlines out* afterwards, more due to his own\namusement than that of the audience). Both\nof these characters would have \"stolen the\nshow\" had it not been for Rosalind\n(Charlotte Cornwell). Now, whatever 1\nthought about \" Rock Follies\" (I must admit I thought it was abysmal), it was almost\nunbelievable for me to see such a superb\nperformance from someone I had always\nassociated with aTV failure.\nMichael Bulman, who sings more than he\nspeaks. (Shakespeare evidently understood\nthat good actors and singers are seldom found\nin\" single entities), is a very good Amiens and\nhandled the music of Stephen Oliver with\napparent ease.\nThe one jar in the whole affair was the\nsudden descent from the ll y tower of a gaudy\ncelestial cloud-like configuration, which\nwhether intended to be realistic, symbolic or\nwhatever ruined (for about five minutes) a very tasteful set. In spite of (his (insignificant)\nobservation, this is a play 1 can strongly\nrecommend).\nDavid M. Weston\nCross Country Club\nAt the start of the final race of the London\nCollege's League, last Wednesday, IC had a slender 29 point lead over both UC and LSE.\nThe race was held over our home course at\nPetersham, in Richmond Park, and drew 120\nstarters. Yet again IC were dogged by injuries\nand illness causing the absence of key first\nteam members. However, all was not lost, for\nhelp was at hand from th e Royal College of\nMusic, as staff member Mick Fuller and Old\nBoy Stu Littlewood arrived.\nDespite his advancing years, Fuller still has\nall the power and grace of a would-be\nsuperstar, and he shot off with the leading\nbunch, and was lying 2nd at the half-way\nmark. Further down the field the remainder of\nthe team, with the exception of Gary\nLonghurst, started slowly but were soon\nforging through the field in fine style. The\nconditions underfoot were nearly perfect and\nwere favourable to fast times. Fuller lost a place on the final hill but still came 3rd in 27-20 (thus gaining a mention in the Daily Mail)\nNext home was Ian Morton in an astonishing\n28-40 (14th place) slashing one minute off his\nbest for the course. The trusty Littlewood was\non top form and came in 18th, just ahead of\nMark Pickard 20th. Steve Kirk caught a bug\nand had a poor run to come in 23rd completing the scoring 5 in the 'A' team. A short distance behind, Brian Acford and Mick\nKelly had ploughed through from the back\nand caught the fit hU C runner in the final\n200yd s, finishing 31st and 32nd respectively.\nGary Longhurst had the 'Run of His Life' and\ncame home 41st in what was once again a personal best time. He was closely followed\nby the improving Geoff Sherwood in 48th. Maurice Wilson was making yet another\ncomeback after injury and did well to come in\n55th, followed by Ian Alvey in 71st and Mark\nThwaites 77th, completing the ' B' team. Ian\ndid particularly well considering that he had\nalready run 10 miles in order to mark both the\nmens' and womens' co uses. For only the\nsecond time this year we fielded a'C team\nwhich included the improving Tim Hayward\n83rd, Miriam Rosen (who shunned the\nshorter Ladies' race) 104th and the\ndetermined Francis Smith 115th. In this race IC were narrowly beaten by UC, but had enough in hand to win the league\noverall. Over the season 28 educational\nestablishments in the London area have\ncompeted and victory was a fine achievement. Just to emphasise our strength\nin depth, the 'B' team finished 6th, which was\na superb performance. Would we have won\nwithout Mike and Stu?- Yes, but only by 3\npoints in 1900! Still all good things come to an\nend, for IC put up a dismal performance in the\nHyde Park Relay-but that's different story....\nBryan Acford\nRCS Rugby Sunday saw the return of the R.C.S. Rugb,\nSevens, after two years absence due to\nadverse weather. It was a beautiful day and\nthe combatants were gathered early in Beit\nQuad, many of them suffering from\nhangovers owing to adverse drinking habits.\nNicky Morton, in particular, was still \"fairly\ngone\", having breakfasted on white shield.\nThe tournament started at about twelve\nwith nine teams whose extravagant names\nvaried from Wedgie's Wankers to Fox's Hounds. The teams were split into two groups\nand played on a league basis. Early on in the\nday the Wankers found themselves in hot\nwater against the experienced but ponderous\nHounds. The Hounds in turn foundered\nversus the expert life sci \"Allstars\", whilst the\nluckless Physics 1 gave a brave but doomed\nperformance in every match. Meanwhile in\nthe other group, where competition was, I felt, a little more fierce, Maths 1 and R.C.S. Rugby Captain Andy Baker's team (Baker's half dozen), rose to their own respective\nlevels of incompetence. Myer's Maestros\n(Chem 1) won all their matches without\nconceding a score and easily qualified, for\nthe semi-finals as did Selkirk Hall (led by\nJohn Parkes) by virtue of a narrow win\nagainst Morton's Motleys. The Motleys were\nundoubtedly hampered by an inability to\nscore (esp on the wing).\nIn the semis the Allstars overcame the\nSelkirk team, but only just and the spirited\nChem1 beat the, by now much substituted,\npack of Fox's. The final was a very close and\nexciting match with the score tied at six all\n(one try and conversion apiece) so the\noutcome of the day was decided on \"Next\nscore wins\". Eddie Budgen immediately burst\nthrough with a fine run enabling one of his\ncolleagues (whose name unfortunately\nescapes me) to score, the Life Sciences\nAllstars thus winning. Plenty of beer followed\nin the bar with almost everyone having had a superb day out. Long live the Sevens!\nSpecial credit must go to Liz Lindsay for\ncoping with the league tables and paperwork\nall afternoon. Thanks also to the poor\nreferees including Chris Fox, Hugh Barrett\nand Martin Black. The day must have been\nmade the great success it was by its\norganisers Nick Morton and Andy Baker.\nSean O 'Boyle\nORIENTEERING\nCLUB\nAn unusually late start and a bright\nand sunny morning contributed to I.C. Orienteering Club's large turnout last\nSunday for the 'Concorde Chase' at\nHermitage.\nIn the M19A course Ken Warren ran well,\nbut below his best, completing the course in\nabout 80 mins., with Gary Longhurst\nfinishing some 20 mins. behind him. Club Captain, veteran Andy Qiiieklall\nmoved up to M21A with great success,\napparently so de moral ising Steve Kirk with\nhis speed that the latter retired.\nSunday's hero was probably Nigel Ward who broke 100 mins on M21B, while Mick Berry completed an extensive tour of the\nforest and arrived at the M19B finish as it was\nbeing taken down - his time of 2 Ins was\nmatched by Alan Min ney who had to retire\non the same course. You lose some and you\nlose some!\nMick Berry, Transport Officer,\nOrienteering Club\n\n"

Our appeal is based on\nthe recognition that capitalism is world-wide and that the workers of the world\nhave a mutual interest in taking action to abolish it and establish Socialism.\nThe Socialist Party of Great Britain is an independent organisation opposed ic\nthe British Labour Party and all other parties in this country. It is associated with\ncompanion Socialist Parties and groups in Australia. Canada, Jamaica, Ireland.\nNew Zealand, the U.S.A. and Austria.\nThe independence of the Socialist Party of Great Britain and its companion parties rests on the fact that our object and our views on economic and polite al\nquestions are quite different from those of other political parties which claim to\nbe socialist.\nCapitalism or Socialism\nWe live in a system of society known as capitalism.\nUnder capitalism we get the things we need in order to live - food, clothing,\nhousing, travel, entertainment etc. - only by buying them. They arc all produced\nin order to Ix* sold at a profit. What each individual can buy depends on how\nmuch money he has. The life of leisure and luxury enjoyed by the rich few is far\nremoved1 from the laborious and insecure existence of the great majority. Under capitalism this contrast of riches and poverty is universal. The privileged\nminority, either through direct ownership of property, or through\nnationalisation or State capitalism (as in many countries including Russia),\nshare in the proceeds ol the exploitation of the mass of the population in every\ncountry in the world.\nThe object of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, in common with its\ncompanion parties, is to replace capitalism by a world-wide social system -Socialism - in which the means of production and distribution will cease to be .\nprivately owned and will pass to the whole community. This will bring to an end\nthe present competition lor markets and sources of raw materials between the\ndifferent countries which causes international rivalries and leads to war. In a' socialist society articles would be produced solely for the use of mankind. All forms of income derived from exploitation (rent, interest and profit) would\ndisappear. The problem to be tackled by a socialist society would be that ol\norganising the able-bodied population to co-operate in * producing food,\nclothing, houses and all the articles and services needed for the full life of human beings. AH will have free access to the things needed, production and distribution\nbeing in accordance with the socialist principle: \" From each according to his\nability: to each according to his need\".\nSocialism cannot be brought about inside the capitalist system. One social\nsystem must be replaced by the other and Socialism is necessarily world-wide.\nSocial Reforms do not lead to Socialism\nThere is only one road to Socialism, and the policy of dealing with social\nproblems one by one is useless from the socialist stand-point. The object of\nsocialists is to achieve a fundamental change in the basis on which society is\nconstructed. Whatever elf ect reforms may have in ameliorating particular evils\nthe v fail because they cannot bring about the necessary fundamental change.\nAmong the problems facing the working class are unemployment, rising\nprices, the insufficiency of wages and the shortage of decent housing. These same\nproblems were also harassing workers 50 and a100 years ago. The workers'\nstruggle to improve their living standards goes on but the problems will never be\nsolved under capitalism.\nThe Socialist Party of Great Britain recognises the importance of keeping up\nthe struggle over wages and working conditions but this is not enough; it still\nleaves unchallenged the hold of the capitalists on the means of production and distribution.\nThe Socialist Partv of Great Britain does not support nationalisation, properly\ncalled State capitalism. Nationalisation is not Socialism and does not lead to\nSocialism.\nThe Road to Socialism\nSocialism cannot come about until the majority understand and desire it and democratically take the steps necessary to achieve it. The socialist majority,\nusing the vote to gain control of the political machine, will use that control to\nintroduce the fundamental social changes required in the interests of the human race. The control of the State machine necessary tor Socialism cannot be\nachieved by strikes, general strikes, or insurrection.\nBecause social reforms cannot lead to Socialism, (he Socialist Party of Great\nBritain restricts its me ml x* r ship to those who are convinced socialists, and does\nnot admit people who are interested merely in lessening the evils of the capitalist\nsystem.\nThe S.P.G. B. and Leadership\nThe breaking of election promises by other political parties is inevitable while\ncapitalism lasts, but even if all their promises were kept it would still leave\ncapitalist exploitation intact.\nThe Socialist Partv of Great Britain has never made promises that it would\nsolve the problems of the working class within capitalism.\n$ Nor does the Socialist Party of Great Britain oiler to act as leaders. Leaders\ncannot solve the workers\" problems. The workers have to solve their own problems by making the ell br t necessary to understand how capitalism works,\nand how it must be replaced by Socialism.\nWhat is required is not trust in leaders and their promises but an attitude of\nself-reliance and the determination to understand the nature of the problems\nthemselves. The working class, the vast majority of people, has the great task of\nachieving Socialism and thus enabling the human race to t kea step forward in\nsocial progress.\nThe world you live in, like the one your forefathers lived in, brings you little\nmore than hard work, insufficient wages and insecurity. Is this all you want, all you are prepared to bequeath to your children, when a world free from those and\nother problems is within your grasp? Leaving the job of understanding and acting to others gets you nowhere.\nThose who would be free of insecurity and the tribulations of capitalism must\nthemselves understand and join with their fellow-workers to take the action that\nwill obtain their mutual emancipation. It is the only effort that will bring\nworthwhile results.\nAt the formation of the Socialist Party of Great Britain an Object and Declaration of Principles were drafted and adopted as the basis of the\norganisation. Admission to membership is dependent on acceptance and understanding of the Object and Principles. The original draft has been retained\nwithout alteration because no change has taken place in the structure of\ncapitalism calling for a change in the statement of the socialist aim and principles.\nWhere We Stand\nSocialists belong to a single world movement for the achievement oi Socialism\nby majority democratic action through the ballot. Socialists do not support or\ncollaborate with any of the governments or political parties of capitalism, and refuse to take sides in capt it a list wars and quarrels which set worker against\nworker. There is only one working class and only one socialist attitude.\nDisputes about frontiers, campaigns to capture markets for exports or to\nrestrict imports, and demands for barriers in the way of immigration or\nemigration are capitalist issues. Socialists do not allow themselves to be drawn into such capitalist quarrels as those about frontiers - between East and West\nGermany, Italy and Austria. Northern and Southern Ireland, Israel and Egypt.\nNorth and South Vietnam or any other of the so-called nationalist, religious or\nlanguage conflicts that divide the working class. Socialists do not support any of\nthe groupings of the capitalist world - British Commonwealth, European Economic Community, American, Russian or Chiense power-blocs. The enemy\nis capitalism in all countries.\nSocialists are opposed to the senseless violence of rioting, bom throwing and guerilla warfare, which serve no interest except that of the capitalist reaction.\nIf you would like to discuss an v of the above please come to a meeting\n\" Socialism or reformism\" in Hu x lev340 at 6-15 p.m. on Tues 6th March. Arranged by IC Socialist Society.\nTHE SOCIALIST PARTY OF GREAT BRITAIN\nOBJECT:\nThe establishment of a system of society based upon the common\nownership and democratic control of the means and instruments for\nproducing and distributing wealth by and in the interest of the whole\ncommunity.\nDECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES The Socialist Party of Great Britain holds:\n1 That Society as at present constituted is based upon the ownership of the\nmeans of living (i.e.. land, factories, rail wav s, etc.) by the capitalist or master\nclass, and the consequent enslavement of the working class, by whose labour\nalone wealth is produced.\n2 That in society, therefore, there is an antagonism of interests, manifesting itself\nas a class struggle, between those who possess but do not produce, and those who produce but do not possess.\n3 That this antagonism can be abolished only by the emancipation of the\nworking class from the domination ol the masterclass, by the conversion into the\ncommon property of society of the means ol production and distribution, and their democratic control by the whole people.\n4 That as in the order of social evolution the working class is the last class to\nachieve its freedom, the emancipation of the working class will involve the\nemancipation of all mankind without distinction of race or sex.\n5 That this emancipation must be the work of the working class itself\n6 That as the machinery of government, including the armed forces of the\nnation, exists only to conserve the monopoly by the capitalist class of the wealth\ntaken from the workers, the working class must organise consciously and politically for the conquest of the powers of government, national and local, in\norder that this machine rv, including these forces, may be converted from an\ninstrument oi oppression into the agent of emancipation and the overthrow of\nprivilege, aristocratic and plutocratic.\n7 That as all political parties are but the expression oi class interests, and as the\ninterest of the working class is diametrically opposed to the interests of all sections\nof the master class, the part v seeking working-class emancipation must be hostile\nto every other party.\n8 The Socialist Party of Great Britain, therefore, enters the field of political\naction determined to wage war against all other political parties, whether\nalleged labour or avowedly capitalist, and calls upon the members of the\nworking class of this country to muster under its banner to the end that a speedy\ntermination may be wrought to the system which deprives them of the fruits of\ntheir labour, and that poverty ma v give place to comfort, privilege to equality,\nand slavery to freedom.\nReproduced by permission,\nSubmitted by Barry Austin.\n\n"

Despite a scheduled start of 10:00, the first match\ndidn't get under way until 11:00. A good thing too, since most of\nthe IC contingent didn't arrive until 10:15.\nThe teams were divided into two pools of three, with the top\ntwo from each pool going into the semifinals. In the first pool( IC 2 nds, Kings, Chelsea), Kings made it abundantly clear that\nthey were after the trophy. Although they were two men short,\nthey won both their matches32. The final match in the pool started well for IC, with Dave Brown winning his fight with a fine\nhold down. However, even the appearence of Barry War eing' snaked legs when his kit ripped( and of Steve Wright's after he\ngenerously loaned Barry his trousers) couldn't save IC; they lost the remaining fights to go down41. The second pool (IC 1sts, QM C,Q EC) provided a completely\ndifferent story. Imperial College\nabsolutely annihilated the opposition. Owen Tutty put IC\ninto the lead against QE C with a very good shoulder throw. The\nother members of the team\nfollowed this up with a succession\nof hold downs to win the match 5-0. Against QM C, Owen again gave\nIC the lead, this time with a hold\ndown. Brian Clarke put IC two# up\nwith probably the most spectacular win of the comp-et it iona superbly executed hip\nthrow after less than a minute. The\nrest of the team won their fights to\ngive IC a second 5-0 victory. With\nQM C winning their match against\nQE C, the semi-final line up was\nKings vs QM C, Chelsea vs IC 1sts. Realising that there was a chance of finishing the\ntournament before Stan's Bar\nclosed, the teams opted to carry\non straight away. The first semifinal gave Kings their 3-2\nvictory, but the second was more\nof a nail biter, with some fine judo\nfrom both sides. In the end, wins\nby Owen Tutty, Tony Hall and\nNigel Blott carried IC through.\nAfter a five-minute break to\nallow IC a chance to get their\nbreath back, the final began.\nKings won the first fight, but then\nNigel won his fight with a choke\nhold. This gave ICan unassailable\n3-1 lead and, despite losing the\nlast fight, the trophy.\nI would like to than k all those\nwho helped in the organisation\nand running of the tournament,\nespecially Steve O 'Connor and\nJeff Walker for refereeing, timekeeping and scoring.

Tel another fabulously\ndecorated vehicle to brighten up your day.\nOne car, built specially for the show is called\" Spirit of'54\" and is styled similarly to a Ford40 Victoria.

Also notable was\" Much a Blige d\"a Marina van used as an advert for a business practice in mural work. Generally mural painting can be criticised for its lack ol originality and there were few examples that went against such criticism, but' Much a Blige d\" was in a class of its own. Also unique was the ghastly Hurling er,a sickly pink bat mobile with a similar owner who polished it with great care\nand attention.... just another gimmick to attract an audience. There were many vehicles which originated from'32 upwards that had been completely rebuilt with chromium engines,\nleather, velvet or fur upholstery, jacked up with wide tyres but one was much the same as another.\nThe vans provided some interest and novelty.

If things needed brightening up at all Capital Radio provided topical sounds and generally comp ered the event. There was also a film that I did not get to see. One thing though. The refreshments were cheap for such events.\nAll in all it is a great experience. It'swell worth the effort\nrequired to get up there even if (like me) you' re not a mad enthusiast. It's less commercial than I had first imagined and at\n\u00a31.30 not at all bad value.\nTh e\"H t tr ling er\"\nThe show is open from11 am till 9 pm this evening and from10 am to 7 pm tomorrow and Sunday. Two hours is ample time to see everything worth looking at.\nTake some sound advice if you should choose to go this\nweekend. Get there as early as possible because it gets crowded by late morning. The easiest route by public transport is by tube to Finsbury Park then catch aW3 bus which stops right outside the door. Oh, keep your paws off the exhibits 'cos there's lots of new paint that isn't quite hardened. Words and Pix John Shuttleworth "

In brief this means that\nLoughborough and Borough Road Colleges\n(or as they prefer to be called, WLIHE) have\nshared out the prizes between themselves.\nWell what of the race? The start, at 3.00 p.m. alongside the traditional lamp post, was its\nusual stampede as 120 runners carved a path\nfor themselves through the Saturday\nafternoon crowds (no injuries have been\nreported, luckily).\nThe race was really on! On the third lap\nSebastian Coe of Loughborough, finding his\nteam second, decided to alter placings with\nthe leaders WLIHE. However, John Davies,\nhad other ideas. The two of them proceeded\nto set the race alight. At the end of the lap\nJohn Davies stormed away from Coe to finish\nahead. In fact this sprinting gave John the\ntime of 13 mins 17 sees, a new record, for the\nthree mile course. Sebastian Coe crawled in,\ndefeated, in the second fastest time of the\nday.\nThe start of the Hyde Park Relay\nLater on, in the final lap, Loughborough\nfinally achieved their aim and got ahead of\nWLIHE.

Last year110,000 people turned up to see customs, vans, rods and bikes and this year's looks like breaking that record. Over the last ten years or so the techniques for turning a motorcar into a travelling work of art have spread over from America and developed in this country. New methods and ideas with manufacturers' recognition of the demand has resulted in a huge\nincrease in the pastime of customizing. It has also become big business. Its popularity was indicated by the numbers at the show last weekend. If you know any on e wit ha Ford Zephyr for sale...\nModifications to cars include anything from decorative\npaintwork and murals to complete redesigning, building and fitting.\nSuch additions as hood scoops, replacement steering wheels,\nspoilers and interior fittings are fairly common. Mural painting is almost a dying art and certainly more aesthetic than it used to\nbe.\nMore extreme examples included chroming the engine and jacking up the rear.\n\"Th e Pn son er\"\nOn arriving at the exhibition it was noticeable that many cars\nin the free park warranted a place inside.

The cost to\nthe College would be around \u00a3440,000, a sum which the Rector said is\njust not available.\nExternal Affairs Officer Sheyne Lucock, organiser of the campaign,\ncommented afterwards that he had realised that it was unlikely that\nCollege would agree to the Union's demands in full.\nHe now hoped that a hardship fund for students suffering financial\ndifficulties because of fee increases could be set up. The campaign\nwould continue as it was also aimed at trying to influence Government.\nHe welcomed the Rector's support.\nThe Rector was answering questions at Monday's IC Union Council\nmeeting on a variety of issues at the forefront of students' minds.\navailability of associated studies,\nthe Rector made it clear that\ndepartments had a high degree of\nautonomy and he could not lay\nwith\nwas\nAsked about refectories he said\nhe had personally experienced\nfood being served not hot\nenough, and sym pathis ed students' complaints. He\ntrying to improve matters.\nStudent accommodation was\nthe subject of another question.\nThe Rector outlined the efforts\nCollege was making to increase\nthe number of places in students\nresidence. The L instead extension was expected to be\nready in 1980, but otherwise the\nCollege was concentrating on\nconverting older properties.\nIn response to a question on the\nfailure of most postgraduate\nresearch students to finish their\ndegrees in three years he stated\nthat it had always been College's view that three years was long\nenough. The problem would be\nlooked into very carefully.\nThe Rector was very much in\nfavour of increasing the number\nof women students in College but\nwas not prepared to lower entry\nqualifications for women. He\nbelieved College had to be made\nmore attractive to women and he\nstrongly supported the existence\nof ICWA.\nAnswering several questions on\ndetails such as exam res its, provision of coffee machines and\ndown a common policy on several\nmatters.\nAsked about recruitment for\njobs in^South Africa, a subject of\nrecent concern to the Academic\nAffairs Committee, the Rector\nagreed that it was reasonable for\nthe Union to communicate its\nviews but it should not intimidate\nthe students involved.\nHe was against College having\na policy not to allow firms to\nrecruit for South African work in\nCollege, but would not allow them to distribute racialist literature.\nThe College Careers Advisory\nService could not be expected to\nhelp the Union put forward its\nviews.\nAcademic Affairs Officer Roger\nStotesbury told a FELIX reporter\nafterwards that he still believed it\nwas wrong for College to allow its\nresources to be used to help firms\nwhich prop up a racialist regime.\nSheyne Lucock said College\nshould recognise that the Union\nrepresents the views of the\nstudents and take note of its\npolicy on South Africa.\nAsked finally whether he ever\nregretted becoming Rector of IC,\nLord Flowers answered \"never\".\nBattle of the Mine 'bottle\" rugby match\nMINES BEAT CAMBORNE Last Saturday, at Harlington, Mines beat Camborne by 15\npts to 3. The rugby match was described by one player as the\nhardest non-dirty game that he had ever played. Before any\npoints had been scored Mines suffered a major setback when\ntheir centre, S. Andrew, had to be taken off with a broken nose.\nHowever, John Coates was on target with four penalty goals\nand one drop goal. Camborne managed to score one penalty\ngoal although in the last minutes of the game they came close\nto scoring a try but Mines had the strength to repulse their\nattack.\nIt had been a hard game with constant pressure from both sides. Each\nteam was positive that it would win and Mines were overconfident at\nthe start of the match, but by the second half Mines had Camborne reeling back on their heels and Mines knew that by keeping up the\npressure they would win. RS M were helped to victory by the vociferous\nsupport of over 150 people including many staff. It was pleasing to note\nthat during all the penalty kirk s there was silence from both sets of\nsupporters. One member of the crowd described the game as more like a 'battle' match than a bottle match.\nThe emotive atmosphere is\ndifficult to describe but for\neveryone who experienced the\ngame the Mines win will be long\nremembered. The rugby captain\nS. Potter was congratulated for\nleading Mines to a memorable\nvictory over Camborne.\nBefore the rugby, Mines played\nCamborne at football. The game\nopened with an own goal scored\nby the Camborne defence and by\nhalf time Mines scored another to\nmake it 2-0. The supremacy of\nRS M led many of the supporters\nto expect an easy victory. The second half saw a comeback from\nCamborne who drew level with a goal and a penalty. Mines were\nunlucky no.t to score several times\nand left it to the last minute to\nscore the winning goal making the result 3-2. \" RS M are magic\n. . . C SM are tragic.\" shouted the\nsupporters and sadly there was\nalmost a tragic end to the game\nfor Camborne. The Camborne goalkeeper was injured while\ntrying to save Mines' winning goal.\nIn the evening a sports' dinner\nco nld. on back page\n\n"

The Union is also to press for the Haldane Library to stock\n\" Gay News\", following votes taken at Tuesday's Union\nMeeting. \" Gay News\" is the fortnightly newspaper for\nhomosexuals which was recently fined \u00a31500 for blasphemy.\nUnion Secretary Mike Elkin, proposing his motion on cannabis, said\nthat there was no evidence that smoking pot was harmful, nor that it led\nto the use of hard drugs. Quoting several Government reports in favour\nof its legal is ation he appealed to Union members to support the motion\nlor the sake of the 5 million people who, he said, had tried cannabis and\nliked it.\nMart Attenborough speaking on the (lay Rights motion\nI'hi i ln by j/ul in Sliiilllruiiilh\nSpeak-In Successful\nLast Sunday saw the opening\nshots in IC Union's tuition fees\ncampaign with a5 and a half hour\n\"speak-in\" at Speakers' Corner.\nFourteen people mounted the\nsoap box in turn to put the Union's case for charging overseas'\nstudents the same rate as home\nstudents and keeping fees at their\npresent level.\nTo emphasise the cause of\noverseas' students there were\nspeeches in Chinese, Hindi and\nDutch, as well as English.\nThere was no press response\nbut plenty of people appeared to\nbe listening and the speakers\nreceived some attention from\nregular hecklers.\nAn amusing incident occurred\nwhen Scott Murray and Rick Ellis\ndecided that Mike Elkin was too\nsmall and went to rectify the\nsituation by \"borrowing\" another\nspeaker's soap box.\nA problem arose when the other\nspeaker discovered the loss and\nsought to retrieve his property,\nresulting in Mike Elkin being\nliterally swept off his feet.\nThe organiser of the speak-in,\nExternal Affairs Officer Sheyne\nLucock, said that it had been a worthwhile exercise in that the\nspeakers had become more aware\nof the arguments and issues. He\nhad not expected to convince a lot\nof people but considered the\naction a success.\nThe tuition fees campaign is\ncontinuing with daily lobbies of\nMPs despite a recent discovery by\nSheyne that Parliament is not\nsitting until March 5th because of\nthe devolution referendums.\nThe meeting defeated an\namendment proposed by Colin\nPalmer. He was against the\nlegal ising of cannabis because not\nenough was known about its long\nterm effects. There were enough\nlegal drugs, like tobacco and\nalcohol already.\nBarry Austin also referred to\ntobacco in his speech against the\nmotion pointing out that before\nthe war tobacco was thought to be\nharmless. He was concerned\nabout the effect of pot on driving.\nMike Elk in maintained that\nthere had been extensive research\non cannabis. On a vote the\nmotion was carried.\nGAY RIGHTS The motion on gay rights,\nproposed by IC Gay Society\nChairman Bob Rigby, called for\nschool sex education to include\ninformation about gay relationships and opposed the ban on Gay News by W.H. Smith.\nIt also called for an end to the\nrefusal of some newspapers to\nprint advertisements for gay\norganisations and asked IC Union to place such an advert is ment to\nsee whether it was accepted.\nThe call for Haldane Library to\nstock Gay News was added by\nUnion President Mary Attenbo, rough.\nThe meeting erupted into\nhilarity when Barry Austin,\nspeaking agin st parts of the\nmotion referred to school education on gay rights as\n\"ramming it down their throats\". He did not appear to understand the\njoke.\nDespite a speech by Tony Leech who, referring to the Bible,\nclaimed that homosexual relationships were wrong, the\nmotion was almost entirely\ncarried. Only a section supporting the right to \" AID\"( artificial insemination by donor)\nfor lesbians proved unacceptable\nto the Union and was defeated.\nOLD POLICY External Affairs Officer Sheyne\nLu cork proposed a motion\ndealing with the updating of old\nUnion policies. The meeting\nagreed to his proposal.\nPolicy of three years ago will\nnow be brought to the attention of\na Union meeting. It will be\nautomatically ratified unless any\namendments are put forward, in\nwhich case discussion will take\nplace at a subsequent meeting.\nThe meeting adjourned at 2.35\npm leaving two motions on the\nagenda, one on \" Time and Celtic\nDiscrimination\", the other on Job Recruitment for South Africa.\nCOU Il C il Report- Monday 26th \u2022\nAll departmental representatives are to be given pots in\nthe Union bar following\nlengthy discussion at Monday's IC Union Council\nMeeting.\nThe Union is to buy the pots\nat the rate of three each year\nand the order of awarding them is to be decided by\nlottery.\nAl present only the Physics\nrepresentative has a pot which\nwas presented by his department\nseveral years ago. Council defeated an initial move to\nremove the Physics pot from the\nbar until all departmental representatives had pots.\nHALDANE LIBRARY Council passed a motion setting\nup a committee to deal with the\nbuying of books and records, for\nthe Haldane Library. The committee will replace the\nstudent book buyer and record\nbuyer.\nCommittee Chairman will be\nthe Deputy President, a Union Meeting will elect two members\nand IC Radio will appoint a, fourth, as they are recognised to\nhave considerable experience\nwith records. The President and\nHonorary Secretary will be ex-officio members.\nSTUDENT RESIDENCE Discussion took place on a proposal to be put to College's Student Residence Committee\nthat selection of3 rd and 2nd year\nnew applicants for places in\nCollege residence should be\nrandom.\nCouncil disagreed with this\nsuggestion and decided to support\nCollege's present policy of giving\npreference to final year students\nbecause it was their last chance of\ngetting into hall.\nRAG COMMITTEE All College Social Representatives are to be ex-officio members\nof Rag Committee. Council agreed to a change in the Rag Committee Constitution which\nwill bring the Committee membership up to about 100\npeople.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT A new job description for the\nsabbatical Deputy President was\nagreed by Council and will be put\nto the vote at the next Union General Meeting.\nThe job includes responsibility\nfor financial matters as well as all\nthe tasks of the present D.P. WOMEN INVITED Following complaints by\nQueen Alexandra House residents about noise from the\nUnion Building, Council decided\nto try to foster good relations\nbetween the fn and IC students.\nDeputy President Malcolm Brain is to write to the residents,\nwho are all women, inviting them\nto use IC Union facilities and\ninforming them of events.\nSIL WOOD MEETING Council decided to hold one\nmeeting next term at Silwood.\nThe Union would provide\ntransport but Council members\nwould have to pay for it. \u2022\n\n"

President?\nIt's not exactly the kind of activity that most\npeople associate me with (when they\nassociate me with any kind of activity at all).\nPerhaps I can't find a job or I'm failing my\ndegree and just want somewhere to hang\naround for a year until I can fool some\nunsuspecting firm to take me, with the title\nproviding me with a little more hope.\nPerhaps I just want another pot in the Union bar and to increase my pulling power.\nPerhaps I just want the job for the hall place it\nprovides, or the grant without any lectures to\ngo to. Perhaps I just want the fame.\nThese are all good enough reasons for\nstanding, and I must admit that all these\ncrossed my mind. In fact if some of these perks\ndidn't exist you'd find it hard to find anybody\nto stand who wasn't an out and out\nmasochist, whereas I'm much better known\nfor my sadistic tendencies. Nevertheless, a little genuine motivation never did anyone\nany harm and I 've got a scrap of it\nsomewhere. Without being sentimental, I 've\nreally enjoyed the past three years here, and\nhave always at least tried to get involved in\nboth I.C. Union and the C.C. U.s.A year\nwithout lectures gelling in the way of that\ninvolvement seems custom built. I'm not a power li end. the President does not run I.C., he coordinates it.

Sec.\nCANDIDATE: Bernard Smith\nPROPOSER: Pete Davis\nOkay then why vote for Bernard?\nWell basically because he knows what the\njob entails, and he can do the job best. The Honorary Secretary has many jobs to do but\nfundamentally he ran be seen as an\nadministrator. He'has to co-ordinate all the\npaperwork of the Union. However the Hon. Sec. is a sabbatical post and as such the\nstudents should get the most out of him. After\nall we are paying his salary!\nWell Bernard should have little trouble\nwith the administration. He knows exactly\nhow difficult the job of secretary can be: he\nwas the R. C.S.U. Rag secretary in his first\nyear, and is R. C.S.U. Academic Affairs\nsecretary this year, as well as being Physics\nDepartmental Representative, Bernard is\nalso able to work with secretaries, very\nimportant if reports on meetings are to be\nprepared on time.\nAs a sabbatical the Hon. Sec. must be able\nto work with College Authorities. Bernard is\nat present doing this through his work on the\nsix college committees on which he sits. So if\nyou want an Hon. Sec. who will achieve\nsomething for students vote for Bernard.\nPete Davis\nWell why me?\nI believe I can do the job well and I want to\ndo a lot for the students at Imperial. I hope to\nsee higher attendances at next year's Union Meetings by getting the Union to do things\nwhich benefit the majority of students. The Union should be more interested in the\naverage student; it is they I want to help. I won't make any easy promises to you, except\nthat I want to look at facilities for students in\nfive to ten years time. I believe in looking to\nthe future.

The news\nreport in today's FELIX is important for\nMines and especially the teams and supporters who experienced the match. As\nEditor of FELIX I will include much more\nspace for the coverage of such events and will\nmake it a priority to include photographs to\naccompany the news stories.\nAt Imperial, after spending hours\nattending lectures and writing coursework,\nstudents need to relax. The Drake's Seven\ncartoon is the most popular feature in\nFELIX! I understand the importance of\nincluding political articles and I will make\ntheir layout attractive. To balance them I will include more lighter material ... more\ncartoons, a regular crossword and amusing\nnews stories that cover the fun side of college\nlife.\nMy experience as a journalist has included\nwriting for my local newspaper while serving\na four year apprenticeship in industry. I have\nbeen a scriptwriter for STOIC and appear on\nIC Radio by reviewing their review of\nFELIX. I 've written many news items for\nFELIX covering events involving students\nfrom overseas, stories from the halls of\nresidence, rag events and C CU activities. I write the Day By Day page jointly with Jill\nDawson. It contains more than just headline\nnews and I hope many students enjoy reading\nit. Much time is spent making the layout ol\nthe page as interesting as possible.\nThere aren't enough photographs in\nFELIX.

This resulted in the usual\nfights etc. culminating in one of their forwards being sent off(thank God he was too- a real animal!).\nWe had drafted in Hu w Price-Stevens and Mines' skipper Simon\nPotter for the match due to another abundance of injuries and these two\nplayers managed to retain quite a strong line up for us.\nEarly on in the game Hu w was injured and had to go off leaving the\neffervescent Steve Dobney to stand in at scrum-half. Although Steve\nseems to end up as utility man in these situations he put on an excellent\ndisplay and one wonders whether or not he should make scrum-half his\nregular position. I can see his 'beard' swelling as he reads this so I 'll go\non to other things!\nI can't remember who scored so apologies to those who did, but I do\nremember that the tries scored were all good ones- ie mostly team tries\nending up with the winger scoring etc. To sum up, a good performance\nfrom everyone and in particular from S.

Ill 3 vs. U.C. Ill 0\nWed. 21st February\nDave Hall called 'heads', and the fate of John Shuttleworth was\ndecided; he was promoted from the fourths to the thirds, to bring their\nnumber to 8. 3 hockey players were quickly signed up to complete the\nteam, and we set off for that northern outpost of London soccer,\nShenley.\nI.C.5 th s1:0 Birkbeck III\nWith Steve Veats looking\ncompletely in control the only\ndanger to the Fifth's appeared\nto be John Healy, but despite\nhis usual erratic driving,\neleven Fifth team ers arrived, intact, at Birkbeck's ground to do 'battle'.\nThe Fifth's took an early lead\nwhen a line run by Mo Misra. in\nhis debut game, carved up the\nBirkbeck defence and from the\nresulting cross Aled Phillip's buried the ball in the back of the\nnet. Having seen what the Filth's were capable of. if allowed to play\nfootball. Birkbeek realised the\nbest solution was to kick anything\nthat moved, and for much of the\nrest of the match were allowed to\ndo so by a fairly weak referee.\nIn the second half a good goal\nfrom Mo Misra following some\nclever interplay by Mark Clegg\nand Steve Kaye was disallowed\nIn the referee who now seemed to\nbe deteriorating rapidly. Apart\nfrom these isolated incidents of\nfootball, ruining what could have\nbeen a very good clogging match\nfor Birbeck, particular credit\nmust go to Steve M cP hail and i Adam Esberger who proved not\ni only adapt at playing football but\nI also very handy at mixing it when\nrequired. As for Al Cable, the\nFifths mild mannered sweeper\nand captain, the whole game\nseemed a long way removed from\nthe normal Shakespeare recital.\nBefore finishing, it must be\nmentioned that MoM isra, and Russ Gilbert, in goal, both\nplayed exceptionally well on their\ndebut games, and Steve, Jaws,\nWat s seem to cope admirably\nwith his sudden change from\nkeeper to centre-half. All three\nhaving just been promoted to the\nFifths from lower teams\nTeam: Russ Gilbert, Steve McPhail,\nSteve haye, Al Cable (Caf>t), Steve\nVeals, Damion Telly. Adam Esberger,\nMark Clegg, Aled Phillips, John\nHealy, Mo Misra.\nSeveral hours later: -Dave Hall called 'heads', and\nelected to play uphill. The first 20\nminutes saw the thirds trying a daring new plan. They attacked\ninstead of defending! This so\nconfused U.C. that they mounted\nonly one real attack in the first\nhalf. Fortunately keeper George\nOkuniewski woke up in time to\npush the ball against the post.\nAt half time, it was decided, over\noranges, to continue with this rare\nnew policy of attack. Five minutes\nlater, Giles Brereton scored.\nInstead of fainting in amazement,\nthe team played on and John\nShuttleworth scored our second.\nOur unimaginative opponents\ndecided they would copy us and\ntry attacking themselves. After a few minutes of practice they\nbecame quite good at it, and hit\nthe crossbar. Lito Rich thought\nthey needed another demonstration of how to score, and promptly\nput the ball in their net. Full time\ni came, and it was hard to tell which\nside was more shocked with the\nfinal score.\nSadly ITV lost their recording of\nthis epic game and had to show\nthe Wrexham vs. Spurs cup-tie\nthat evening instead.\nTeam: George Okuniewski, Dave\nHall, Des McGuckin, Giles\nBrereton, John Turton, Alan\nDonaldson, Adrian Leach, Ollie\nPio, John Shuttleworth, Scott\nMurray, Lito Rich.\nThe Kensington Cruncher\n\n"

If you want to decorate your room with election\npublicity please wait until after the voting has taken place. The nI'm sure the candidates will be only too pleased to have their\nposters removed lest they are fined.\nAnother way of getting to know a prospective sabbatical is by listening to or watching their IC Radio or STOIC promotions. These are broadcast regularly and are generally more detailed than a poster could be. Manifestos also appear in this and next\nweek's issue of FELIX. Four candidates chose to put their manifestos in today's issue, the rest will appear next week.\nPlease make use of all the media to aid your choice.

I was\nunable to do so. I challenge Mr. Shotter to give me just one reason\nwhy it is wrong, that does not refer\nto the Bible.\nOn a small technical point, if\nGod is so much against \" men lying with men\" why did he\ndesign the body in such a way as\nto make it possible?

It is\nnot so much the specific\ncomplaint involved (about a hot-dog, the story of which the\nbarman gives a rather different\naccount of than that given in the\nletter), but rather the accusation\nthat \"college bars are very keen lo lake\nyour money and offer yon no service in\nreturn,no pleases or thankyou s\" which\nwe feel must be answered.\nIt is worth remembering that\nthe prices in bars are determined\nby Refectory Committee and\nhave nothing to do with the bar\nstall'. It is the opinion of countless\ni regular customers, including\nourselves, that the staff do a difficult job very well.

Surely there as many gods\nand facets of religion as there are\npeople.\nHe takes an example from\nLeviticus in support of his view\nthat homosexuality is a sin and\nabhor ant to God( whose?). Literal\ninterpretation of the Bible is\n\u2022dangerous ground - what of the\nGenesis version of the Creation,\nthe laws of hygiene necessary lor a nomadic dessert life, or the\nimagery of Revelations? There\nare many other examples.\nA literal interpretation of\nselected parts of the Bible might\nbe very well as a \"first and last line\nof defence in ally mailer of dispute\",\nbut it ignores the conditions in\nwhich it was written, or the\ndeeper, often hidden, meanings\nand lessons. An intelligent informed approach is more\nproductive, even if it requires\nmore effort.\nAbandonment of the intellect\nand as lavishness to the written\nword should not be necessary lor\nparticipation in spiritual matters.\nYours, with faith, hope and\ncharity lor the cerebral hemispheres.\nJan H.

    "content": "Page 7\nDo You Take\nIt For Granted?\nAlthough it is important to publicize grant anomalies\nthroughout the student population, appropriate authorities\nand the general public, it is absolutely vital to keep sight of the\nbasic issue, the main rate. Of course, cases of individual\nhardship must be pursued vigorously and, in particular,\ncommon problems, such as those arising from the Means Test,\nneed special attention. However, the most important grant\nissue for most British students is the main rate and, for IC, the\nLondon rate.\nThis year the NUS are asking the Government for an increase of 27%\non the main rate, which is at present \u00a31100. This is based on an estimate\nof 12% for inflation and a revised assessment of students' costs.\nSeveral aspects of this revision students is travel. There is\nare specially relevant to IC students. The most important of\nthese are the rent and food\nelements. In recent years, these\nboard and lodging rates have\nincreased disproportionately compared to the overall rate. For\nLondon students in particular,\nthis has meant even less money for\neverything else. Rents in ' the\nprivate sector in London have\nincreased alarmingly and College\nand University residence rents are\nfixed according to the appropriate element in the grant.\nHence the residue for travel,\npocket money, books, clothes and\nentertainment has become smaller proportionately, lagging\nbehind inflation.\nThe other major element of the\ngrant which is of interest to IC The BrainDrain\nPOSTERS\nI 've had complaints from some societies that people are taking their\nposters down, in some cases probably to put on their own walls. Posters\ncan cost a lot of money, and removing them is a disciplinary offence; if\nyou want one for your wall, have a bit of patience and wait until the event\nbeing advertised has happened, then you can take as many as you want.\nNOISE\nI'm sorry that I 've had to be so strop py at parties and concerts in the\nUnion of late, but we have been visited by the police recently because of\nthe noise and some local residents have been threatening to take the\nUnion to court because of it. Hopefully, the use of the Great Hall for\nconcerts in the future will help the situation, and later on in the year I will\nbe applying to College for help to noise proof some rooms, but in the\nmeantime if you're organising an event in the Union, please turn the\nmusic down when I tell you, otherwise we might be stopped altogether.\nREFECTORIES\nI notice that there was a letter in last weeks FELIX from someone who\ndid not support the recent refectory boycott because he finds \"the\nquality and price quite reasonable\". The author of this letter appears to\nhave given some thought to the issue (unlike, I suspect, the other people\nwho broke the boycott) and I apologise to him for any comments I made\nin a previous article. Since he finds the quality of food satisfactory, it is\npresumably the standard he was accustomed to before com mg to I.C.I wish to offer, on behalf of the vast majority of students at I.C., our\nsincere sympathy for the pains his alimentary canal must have suffered\nover the years and hope that the resulting stomach ulcers are not fatal.\nTHANKS\nThanks are due to Rugby Club for making an excellent job of washing\ndown the Union Building, and Adrian, Mike and Howard for various help\nover the past week.\nMalcolm Brain\nICU Deputy President\nis travel. I here is a certain amount (\u00a334) in the grant\nfor this purpose, and any extra\nincurred through commuting,\nand travel from home, is generally\npaid by the LEA at the end of the\nyear. This system means that\nmany students have a lot of\nmoney tied up in season tickets\nuntil the end of the year, which is\nobviously an unsatisfactory\nsituation.\nThe National Grants Demonstration is next Friday,\n9th March, and includes a float\nfrom IC. Everyone interested in\nthe grants issue, which means all\nIC students should take part and\nanyone prepared to help with the\nfloat should contact me.\nTim Hillyer\nExternal Affairs Committee\nElk's Epistle (5)\nELECTIONS (of the Sabbatical kind)\nThese tributes to the democratic structure of Imperial College Union\nare taking place by college wide ballot on the 12th and 13th March\n(Monday and Tuesday). The point of this little bit of prose is that if you\nknow for some reason that you're not going to be in college on those\ndays (and it has to be a good reason) then you can have a 'postal' vote.\nThe details of this haven't been worked out yet, but if you come up and\ntell me next week, I should be able to tell you what you have to do.\nAnd talking of sabbatical elections, we need people to man ballot\nboxes on 12/13th March for 1 pound /hr. from 1 0 am5 pm, if you fancy\nearning some easy money, just come up to the Union Office and tell Jen.\nHUSTINGS\nThe hustings for the s a boat ical elections occur on Thursday 8th March at 1 pm in the Great Hall. It's easily the best way of finding out\nwho are the best candidates for the various positions and I urge you to\nattend. You can ask any candidate any question you might think\nrelevant, so it's an opportunity not to be missed! Lectures, lab, seminars\netc. for the 2:30 - 3:30 period are all cancelled so you can stay until 3:30.\nIf you're not certain who to vote for - make sure you don't miss it!\nSTV\nNo it doesn't stand for Sex Televised Vertically or Southern\nTelevision it stands for single transferable vote and it is a method of\nvoting by which instead of voting for one person you place all the\ncandidates in an order of preference, using numbers 1,2,3 etc....

Sec.\nMARY MUTTERS\nEver since Sonia has been\nvisiting me to collect news\nstories she has pinched all the\nuseful information. Now I can't sound very important\nby writing about all the\nwonderful things I have been\ndoing (well at least not\nwithout repeating what is\nelsewhere in FELIX). Other than hiding under my\ndesk every time the media appear,\nanother solution to this problem is\nfor me to investigate new topics\nand tell interesting stories.\nMy first new story is the full\nunexpurgated facts (why should\nMike have all the sex stories?) of\nthe meeting held between myself,\nfour members of the Union's Permanent Working Party( who?), Captain Lindley (College\nDomestic Secretary). Mr. Mooney (Refectory Manager)\nand three managers of individual\nrefectories.\nWe discussed a fascinating\nreport prepared by P. W.P. based\non surveys of the refectories they\ndid before Christmas. The report\ncontained such gem comments as\n\"About 50% of those asked were\nsatisfied that the quality of food teas up\nto the standard expected from\nInirersity refectories. However, the\nmajority agreed there to be room fin\nimprovement. Apparently many of the\n\"satisfied\" 50% were actually only\n\"resigned\" to the fad that they could\nexpect no be lter\". Lots of useful information and\nhopeful developments came out of\nthe meeting. These included:\nl. Coleslaw in the Union Lower\nrefectory will contain onions (to\ngive it more taste) in future as an\nexperiment.\n2. Fried eggs will be introduced\ninto the Union Lower Refectory.\n3. The introduction of a \"students' salad\" (i.e.a cheap\none) will be investigated for\nSouthside refectory.\n4. All vegetables and fruit are\nbrought fresh from Covent\nGarden Market on Tuesday and\nThursday morning (except some\nfrozen ve g.)5. Custard in Sherfield Lower refectory may not contain enough\nsugar and is t \u00a9 be investigated.\n6. New suppliers of beefburger s are being looked into, after\ncomplaints.\n7. Overhead infra-red heaters are\nto be introduced in some\nrefectories in the next 2-3 weeks,\ni.e. food may be too hot!\n8. Vegetarian (cheap) main courses will be looked into.\nIt was quite a useful meeting\nand we hope in future that the\ncomplaints and suggestions subcommittee of the Refectory\ncommittee will meet more\nregularly and informally in order\nto take up specific complaints.\nThe only thing I should end on\nis a warning about cornish\npasties . Apparently they are\nspecifically designed to have as\nlittle meat content as possible! So\ndon't complain.\nMore stories next week.\nDon't forget Hustings on\n, Thursday. You get until 3.30 p.m. off from lectures. See you on the\nI Great Hall. Mary Attenborough\nICU President\n\n"
