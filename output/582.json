    "content": "Fight\nWorld Poverty\nSINCE its publication last year, the Brandt\nReport has already sold over 100,000 copies in\nBritain, and the response from the general public\nhas been widespread. Several lectures have been\ngiven to capacity audiences in London colleges,\nfor instance Imperial College held a series of four\nlectures on the report last term; two of the\nspeakers were Shirley Williams and the Director\nof Christian Aid, Dr Kenneth Slack.\nThe report is subtitled: ' North South: a program for survival\" and examines the global\nissues of poverty, hunger, and the threat to world\npeace facing both the industrial countries of the\n\" North\" and the developing nations of the\n\"South\". It calls for a summit of world leaders and\nthe implementation of an emergency program\nbased on a global energy strategy, a world food\nprogram, monetary reform and an immediate\nincrease in aid.\nThe summit is to be held in Mexico in October,\nand a lobby of Parliament is being organised by\nthe churches and major aid agencies to try and\nchange the Government's attitude to these\nissues, characterised by the overseas students\nfees policy, the overseas aid cuts, and the massive\nincrease in arms spending. Already thousands of\npeople, including many students, are coming to\nthe lobby, which shows the overwhelming cone rn generated by the Brandt Report. If you would like\nto join them in attending the lobby meeting,\nwhere the speakers will include Michael Foot,\nDouglas Hurd and Shirley Williams, send your\nname, address and home constituency to Fight\nWorld Poverty Lobby, c/oW DM, Bedford\nChambers, Covent Garden, London WC2 E8H A, or just turn up at the St Stephen'sent race to the\nHouse of Commons between 3:00 and 9:00pm on\nTuesday, May 5.\nJonathan Tame\nEaster Puzzles\nWeeks of planning and puzzle writing, two full\nnights of typesetting, and several hours of\nproof-reading with my finest tooth comb.( Toothcomb? How often do you comb your\nteeth?) And still a misprint got through. Apologies all round, especially to JAIT in\nwhose superb cross number the error appeared. As lots of you pointed out, the clue\nfor R should have read R=/( P2\n+ (NHU)2). Because of the mistake, the closing date for\nthe\u00bbprize puzzles has been extended to 1:00pm next Wednesday.\nA message for those of you who have\nbought a copy of the Phoenix: clue 4 Down is\nmissing from Leo Easynob's crossword. (Nice\nto know I'm not the only one who cocks things\nup.) The (rather appropriate) wording of the\nmissing clue is as follows:\nReprinted with lost continuity (11).\nAnd now a message for those of you who\nhaven't bought a copy of the Phoenix: buy a copy of the Phoenix. Apart from poetry, photographs, stories, other articles of great\ncultural worth, and a piece of music composed\nand written by our deputy president elect,\nthere is a superb crossword by Leo Easynob\n(work it out like I had to) and a Scaramouche\npuzzle based on one of the most ingenious\nideas Grey Spider has ever showed me. And each of the competitions carries a prize of \u00a310.\nStrongly recommended.\nAnd so to the answers of the s wordless puzzles in the Easter FELIX.\nCompiled by Phil Webb\nBatavieren\nRace\nFOR the fourth consecutive year, a bunch of\nmisfits namely the \"Impalas\", this year led by\nMark Thwaites, left London, early last Thursday\nmorning to compete in the Batavieren Race,\nthrough Holland and Germany.\nThe race is a twenty-five stage relay for teams\nof nineteen men and six ladies; run from\nNuymeger in Holland, crossing the Rhine into\nGermany then back into Holland to the finish in\nEnschede. The field consisted of one hundred and\nfifty teams from all over Europe.\nOur entrance to Europe was in traditional style\nwith a push start off the ferry. But surprisingly\nNijomegan was reached on schedule; the two new\ndrivers Richard Smith and Gavin Virk managed\nremarkably well.\nThe race started at midnight on Friday. Despite\nstiff opposition, particularly from old rivals\nSurrey, the team quickly moved into a comfortable position, finishing seventh after the\nten night stages. Noteable performances were\ngiven by Richard Smith, Geoff Sherwood, Bryan\nAlford and Ann Conlan.\nThe morning section saw the team's best\nperformance: Hugh Dixon and Karen Harget had\nfine runs. Hugh producing the second fastest time\nfor his stage. The stage was completed by our\nDutch Hostess in great style; out sprinting Surrey\nPirate Radio\nYes, the General is correct to assume that\nthere are no suitable sites for the transmitters.\nFor suppose there are suitable sites. Draw a line from each transmitter to the National\nRadio Headquarters; then two of these lines\nmust make an angle of less than or equal to\n60\u00b0. Consider now the two transmitters on\nthese lines. Whichever is nearer to the N RH will be able to receive signals from the other.\nChance Chess\nBumble should play a conservative game if he\nis winning, and a daring game otherwise. This\nstrategy gives him a surprising 53% chance of\nwinning the championship.\nMagic Square\nOf course, there are infinitely many ways of\nfilling the square, but the simplest is to raise 2\nto the power of the numbers in the example,\nso that the numbers in the first row become\n256, 8 and 16, the numbers in the middle row\nbecome 2, 32 and 512 and the numbers in the\nbottom row become 64, 128 and 4.\nObject In Motion\nThe object is in orbit. Friction with the\natmosphere causes it to drop to a lower orbit\nwhere the orbital speed is higher. The decrease in potential energy compensates for\nthe increase in speed as well as the energy lost\nin friction.\nPlanets\nUsually Pluto is furthest from the sun. But\nPluto's eccentric orbit sometimes takes it\ninside the orbit of Neptune, and that is where it\nhappens to be at the moment. So the answer\nto the question as 1 worded it is Neptune.\nat the line to finish second; thus with six stages to\nrun after a second re-start we lay fifth.\nDuring the afternoon the quality of the\nopposition improved. After the twenty-second\nstage we lay only tenth, despite valient efforts\nfrom all members of the team. The highlight of the\nafternoon was the twenty third stage, run by\nGeoff Sherwood; his was the fastest time, by\nnearly a minute, on the 8.2km stage (27min Olsec)\ngaining four places. Dave Beeson ran the final and\nmost competitive stage finishing strongly in\nseventh place.\nOur overall position was also seventh, down on\nlast years second place, however the standard\nimproves every year so we were well pleased with\nthe result.\nTraditionally the host university puts on a superb party on the Saturday evening continuing\nthrough until the early hours of Sunday morning.\nAs a result, most of the team suffered from a somewhat dazed journey home through Holland\nand Belgium, which was not helped at all by\nsickness and windscreen wiper trouble.\nWe arrived back in London at midnight on\nSunday, all resolved to return next year to\ncompete in the tenth anniversary of the event.\nTEAM: Marion Murphy, Maurice Wilson,\nRichard Ashworth, Mark Thwaites, Bryan\nAlford, Richard Smith, Karen Harget, Phil Hayes,\nRuss Weston. A Harrington, Alf Garnett, Ann\nConlon, Geoff Sherwood, Pete Holdsworth,\nHugh Dixon. Kelvin Alford, Jon Frost, lan\nIsherwood. Gavin Virk, Geoff Jerwood. Pete\nJohnson, Dave Beeson.\nSnooker\nWELCOME back all snooker fanatics, there\nwon't be a lot to report this term as the season\nhas nearly finished. We have had the elections for\nnext year's posts and I wish everyone in a position\nof responsibility a successful year. The President\nwill be J White (Maths 2) supported by C Tripp as\nV'' \u2022\n>\n. President, also from Maths 2.\nI'd like to thank all out-going committee\nmembers who have labour ed relentlessly\nthroughout the year. Special recognition must be\npaid to S Bennet and M Proudlove.\nThere are just two remaining matches to be\nplayed to complete this year's fixtures. They will\ndecide the second and third positions of the\nleague when the B team and C team play\nopposition outside to College. As this last match\nis so important to the B team they will expect\ntheir usual crowd of supporters and well-wishers\nto attend.\nThere are some unfinished competitions and all\npersons concerned should try to complete their\nmatches before exams start.\nHockey\nRCS entered this game hopeful of their first\nvictory in two seasons, despite having lost 2-0 to\nGuilds in the penultimate league game of the\nseason. The first half, although keenly contested\nas usual, was goal-less with most of the pressure\ncoming from Guilds but with neither side making\nany clear-cut chances. The second half continued\nalong the same lines for twenty minutes when\nRCS won their first penalty corner. Cope stopped\nthe ball, and shot, but the ball was deflected by\nthe keeper to Steve Parker whose waist-high shot\ntowards the far post was never going to be\nstopped. Unused to this situation (ie being in the\nlead) RCS relaxed and, within two minutes,\nGuilds equalized from a penalty corner. This only\nseemed to inspire RCS who pushed forward with\nincreasing confidence, winning a free hit just to\nthe left of the D. Mike Cope followed in to flick\nthe ball past his marker and into the goal. With\nonly four minutes to go, Guilds protested\nvehemently but the goal stood and RCS held on\nto gain a deserved victory.\nTEAM: Williams, Parker, Reilly, Hughes,\nMoon, Hutchings, Ayers, Taylor, Leinster, Cope,\nFarrington.\nFELIX, May 1, 1981 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nA motion was brought lo the\nResults U GM towards the end of\nlast term which asked that a prominent member of the Union should be thrown in a convenient\nexpanse ol water. This motion\nwas backed by Mr Richard Archer. R CSU President and a vice-president ol ICl. and Mi Barney McCabe, ICU Deputy\nPresident-elect. Two well-known\npeople in this Union, two popular people whose views carry a lot of weight, because ol\nthe positions they bold or will\nhold, but also because ol their\nown personal abilities and past\ndeeds. This motion seems likely\nto be brought again.\nMr Cortazzi holds no such\nposition. He is secretary ol a political society, he writes letters\nto FELIX, and speaks al UG Ms, and it is because ol this last\nreason, because be says something at a Union meeting, that it\nhas been proposed by these two\npeople that he should be thrown\ninto the Round Pond. What an\nincentive to taking part at aUG M, to lice speech. Arc wc to\nunderstand that if our questions\nto the Executive next year are\nnot phrased in the Queen's English, and do not come lightly\ntripping oil the tongue with every\nnuance and final consonant correctly emphasised to resound\nthroughout the Great Hall, that\nwe will incur the Executive's displeasure, and bum there it will\nbe a short step to being soaked to\nthe skin.'\nBeing soaked to the skin is a treatment one normally associates\nwith initiations, ra it races, rag\nstunts and other activities which\nare automatically linked with\nCCLJs. Those body s like to think\nthat their union meetings are\n\" lun\" and this fun can often\nresult in prominent people in the\nCC Us being punished or something similar by being drenched\nor covered with un savoury materials. Messrs Archer and McCabe. who over the last three\nyears have been active members\nol the R CSU now suggest that\nibis treatment should be cx len cle cl to others. In doing so they\nwill usurp the cole of these CCl s lo amuse I licit membership, and\nlower the regard in which ICU general meetings arc- held, both\nthose who attend and those\nw bo do not.\nIdo not expect that MrC orl azzi will of bis own free will\nl ling himself into any pond or bath, and I don't blame him. I don't think that Messrs Archer or\nM cCa bc expect him to do any\nsuch thing either, and they ask\nthat he be Ihroun in. I suggest\nthat what these two people really\nwant is for Mi Cortazzi to keep\nquiet at Union meetings and to\nslop criticising. To that end they\nwant a motion to be passed\nagainst him at \"the sovereign\nhotly of the Union\",( ICU) in the\nhope that he will shut up.\nIt will be disgraceful if this\nmotion was to be discussed at\nsuch a meeting, and I call the\nproposer s to withdraw it.\nFirstly, if Mr Cort azzi is\nthrown against his will into 01\nonto something, then whomsoever\nshall do so will commit the criminal offence ol assault and\nbattery.\nSecondly, the Union bye-laws\ngive the aims of the Union as\n\"the encouragement ol interest\nby students in matters outside the\nCollege curriculum especially\ncultural and athletic interests\",\nand \"the provision ol a corporate\nIxxly of students to represent and\nto safeguard and advance the\ninterests and welfare of the\nImperial College\". I do not think\nthat the intended treatment ol\nMr Cortazzi is defined specifically in these aims, and that\nit is thc rel bre ultra vire s the Union constitution. This is what is\nknown as a civil wrong. It would\nbe open to anyone in the Union to' initiate civil proceedings against the Union: the Exec might be sued on their own behalf, and on behalf of the\nwhole Union. 'Thus, if it was\nattempted to throw Mr Cortazzi\nin. the proposer s ol the motion,\nthe Executive and anyone else\ninvoked with it would be liable\nlo both criminal and civil proceedings.\nThirdly. I here are those who\nseek to bring lit is Union into\ncontempt in the eyes of other\nstudents particularly in London.\nLondon Student might well say\n\" One ol next year's sabbaticals al\nImperial College is seeking to\nsilence a Union member because\nbe does not like the tone of the\nmember's voice\". That will not\nbe safeguarding or advancing the\ninterest or welfare ol this Union. Fourthly, the concept that this\nmotion or anything like it\nexpresses is a disgraceful sub-jug ation ol the Doctrine ol Freedom of Speech. Whilst it is\nnot so that Freedom of Expression should permit one person to\nuse an excessive amount ol time\nor space lo put forward any one\nview il is also not correct that\nsomeone should be threatened\nwith violence il be dares to express a view at all. You may be\nwondering what Mr Cortazzi has\ndone to deserve all this attention.\n(You will find the motion in\nE\\ee u ti,e Xens.) He has expressed\nan unsatisfactory opinion ol the\nExec, and in particular John \"Dogs ol War\" Passmore. He has\nspoken at UG Ms on issues that\nbe was interested in. He has tried\nto inject some humour into L'G Ms. something which is\nsorely needed, something that\nMr M cCa bc himself thinks would be helpful. For this he has\nbeen subjected to public ridicule\nby Messrs Archer and McCabe, because he has dared to criticise.\nIt is shameful that Executive\nmembers should support this\nmotion, and they will be canting\nhypocrites il they continue with\nit. \u2022 11 this is their altitude Io criticism we might as well turn\nthe Union into an Executive Dictatorship. They are seeking to\ndeny the right ol audience loan individual in view ol a physical\ncharacteristic \u2014 the sound of his\nvoice. That is called disc rim in a tion. They are seeking to punish\nsomeone for expressing a view\ncontrary to that ol those \" in power\" who, ol which these Iwo are good examples, have risen to\nthe lop becoming buoyant by\nputrefaction, rising as they\nrotted. That is called intolerance\nand tyranny.\nThis is a small pom l but an important one. II Messrs An Tier\nand M cCa bc see the role ol the\nexecutive as dictatorial, hypo-critical an il tyrannical I he\\\nshould say so clearly next\nThursday. II they do not they\nshould apologise to MiC otl azzi and to the Union lor having\nthought such a motion accept-able. This motion should be\nthrown out.\nl ours ft til hl ul h'M Ha v ward Civ Eng 1\nEd's Note\nI have printed this letter as\nan exercise in co ncis ion.

Presumably they still\nexpect to find the three houses and the\ncelebrated but impossible attempt to\nconnect each of them to the water, gas\nand electricity supplies with nine pipes\nwhich do not cross each other.\nBut times change, and the three\nsubstations have long since disappeared.\nHappily, the town's propensity for\ntopological curiosity has not, and\nKuratowskigrad now boasts a totally\nunique telephone service.\nThere is no central telephone exchange: you can only phone one\nhouse from another if there is an\nindependent underground cable joining\nthe two houses. And true to the old\ntradition, no two cables cross, and no\ncable passes under a house; each cable\nserves only the two houses at its ends.\nYou might suppose that this restricts\nthe number of places you can telephone\nfrom any given house, and you would be\nright. Nevertheless when I visited the\ntown, my host proudly informed me that\nhe is connected to six of his friends, and\nthat no one in the town is connected to\nless than five others.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB.(5895111 ext. 1048/int. 2881) Copyright FELIX 1981.

TMSoc\nAre you coping with exams? Would you like\nto work more efficiently, think more clearly\nand cope better?\nIf you have ever felt that there's more to\nlife, then transcendental meditation could be\nfor you.\nTM is a technique for self-development which is\npractised by over three million people in all parts\nof the world. It is not a religion, a philosophy or a way of life.\nIn order to learn to meditate you don't have to\ngive up anything or to have any particular beliefs.\nTranscendental meditation is a simple, natural\nmental technique which is practised twice daily\nfor twenty minutes in a comfortable position. The\nprocess is one of direct experience rather than\nintellectual analysis and does not involve\nconcentration. Meditating is a very pleasant and\neffortless experience. It is easily learnt by anyone\nregardless of background. The instruction is only\na matter of a few hours and afterwards there are\nno obligations. TM is not a cult or a belief system\nand there are no contradictions with religion.\nWe have said a little about what the technique\nis but what benefits can this give you. Regular\npractise of TM essentially brings about a greater\nenjoyment and enrichment of daily life. The deep\nrefreshing rest that accompanies meditation leads\nto greater energy and to more efficient and\ndynamic activity. A feeling of well-being and\nhappiness spontaneously grows resulting in easier\ncommunications with others and more loving and\nfulfilling relationships.\nThrough clearer thinking the ability to learn\neasily and to appreciate studying is greatly\nimproved. Stresses and anxieties in the system\nwhich in i bit normal and healthy functioning are\ngradually thrown off resulting in a dramatic\nimprovement in health and brighter perception.\nThe benefits that come from the practise are\nautomatic and cum al it ive, profoundly enriching all\naspects of life.\nEven if you feel sceptical and that you have no\nneed for this or that it's a bit strange, the\npossibilities are so great that it's at least worth\nfinding out about.\nIf you are interested, you are welcome to\nattend an introductory talk in Huxley 341 at 12:45\nor 5:30pm on Thursday, May 7. Refreshments\nwill be provided, or contact Bernard Canetti,\nMaths PG, int 4380 or Oliver Kleyn, Chem Eng\nPG, int 3818.\nLiberal Club\nAs many people will be aware, the local\ngovernment elections take place on May 7. ManyLiberal constituencies in London have contacted\nour club asking for assistance in leafleting and\ncanvassing. If you are interested in taking part in\npractical politics please drop a line to the Liberal\nClub via the Union Office and we will put you in\ntouch with Liberals in the area.\nLabour Club\nThe Greater London Council elections on\nThursday should provide a massive vote in favour\nof socialist policies. The Labour Party is\npromising to cut public transport fares by 25%,\nmore housing to reduce London's chronic\nshortage of accommodation, to create jobs by-investment in industry and to maintain and\nimprove the education system.\nAny assistance with the election campaign will\nbe most welcome.

The\nmeeting included elections for committee posts\nfor next year, the Treasurer's and President's reports, future destinations and further details\nabout the Easter trip.\nNominations were made for all committee\nposts and the results were: President, Chris\nJones; Secretary, Steve Clarke; Treasurer, Steve\nBrown; Publicity Officer, Gordon Folkard;\nTransport Officer, Andy Smith; Equipment\nOfficer, Ian Jones.\nThe present Treasurer, Steve Brown, then\nmade his report, commenting on the present high\nmember subscription rate imposed upon the\ngroup and how the price of an average weekend\nhad still been kept low, compared with recent\nincreases in hostel fees.\nThe rise in the cost of petrol would raise prices,\nhe continued and where possible non-VAT and\nstandard hostels should be booked to reduce\nprices.\nIn the President's report, Chris Jones\nannounced it had been a prosperous year for the\ngroup with weekend trips very well supported, a full Autumn and New Year programme, which\nincluded the Lake District, Snowdonia and the\nPeak District, at fortnightly intervals. Finally the\nPresident confirmed plans to produce a full third\nterm programme of weekends.\nSince the meeting, we've had an excellent\nholiday in the Cairngorms where we camped for\none week. Leaving early from London, we\nmanaged to pitch the tents in the afternoon at-Glenmore campsite. Among the more pro-noun cable mountains we climbed are Cairngorm\nand Ben Macdni (over 4,000ft) and the weather\nthe whole week was hot and sunny.\nThere is the possibility of going on a weekend\ntrip next weekend (May 8 to 10) and again at the\nend of term. Meanwhile we stay active with our\nregular but ty meetings at 12:30pm in Southside\non Thursdays, where future destinations are\ndiscussed and advice is on hand for buying\nequipment.\nSteve Clarke\nLondon to\nBrighton\nCycle Ride\nTHIS YEAR cyclists will again be setting off to\nBrighton from Hyde Park on the sixth annual\nLondon to Brighton cycle ride which this year will\nbe on Saturday, May 9, with a7:30 am start. This\nyear the sixty mile ride will be starting from\nSerpentine Road near Hyde Park Corner due to\nthe large numbers of people expected. For most\nof the cyclists the return will be by special trains\non the Saturday night although accommodation\nwill be available for those wishing to join the social\nin the evening in Brighton.\nOnly thirty people were on the first London to\nBrighton Ride in 1976, but last year over five\nthousand left Speaker's Corner. This year we\nreckon there'll be eight thousand, so come along\nand make it eight thousand and one! All types of\nrider and machine take part, from children to\nclub men, and tandem trikes to unicycles. Don't worry if you've never cycled sixty miles in a day,\nas it's not a race \u2014 everybody goes at her/his\nown speed and at the hills a lot of us get off and\nwalk, so there's a good feeling of togetherness. As\nusual there'll be street theatre and bands to\nentertain, food for the inner man, and bicycle\nrepair vans and breakdown vehicles. For further\ninformation about the route contact Bill\nAlexander or Ronan McDonald, both in Maths 1\nor the London Cycling Campaign, telephone 928-7220.\nPage 10 FELIX, May 1, 1981\n\n"

Former Chairmen include Edward Heath,\nMark Carlisle and John Biffen.\nColin was given a tremendous reception as lie slammed home his\nspeech which is now reprinted below:\n\" As a student journalist I have had to write many reports ol In ion meetings and Conferences but this has been my first FCS Conference. I was shocked at the events that took place in this hall, yesterday.\n\" There was sloppy behaviour from the floor and from the platform.\nThe attitude of the National Committee was poor. Several members\ncasually wandered oil the platform when MPs were speaking. We need\nto improve the image of the Annual FCS Conference.\nNow I briefly discuss my views of the XL'S. Those Colleges who have\nd is affiliated from the NUS should start a new National Union. Other\nColleges will be encouraged to d is affiliate as they will at last have the\nopportunity to be members ol a more representative National Union. \"Imperial College is not a member ol the XL'S and I have actively\ncampaigned to keep it out ol NT'S.\" We are winning the nuclear debate. Nuclear power can be safely\ncontrolled. I believe most people at this conference are pro-nuclear\nexcept of course lor those members of the C XI).

In a letter\ndelivered last night to the RSMU President, Keith\nMaynard, details of the ransom demands were\nrevealed.\nIn addition to the sum of money, which will be\npaid towards RCS Union's charity collection.\nMines executive and others will have to perform\nsome amusing tasks. The first of these, outlined\nin the letter involves the executive and \"at least\ntwo complete rugby teams\" who will have to\nspend this evening standing in front of Big Ben,\nholding a copy of this FELIX and today's New\nStandard. They must produce by 9.00am tomorrow morning, a set of photographs taken\n\"every hour on the hour\" showing themselves\nholding the papers and with the clock in the\nbackground.\nIf Mines refuse to ac cee d to the demands\nFIND BRASS\nRCSU have threatened to sell Davy (which they\nregard as an oversized replica of a Davey lamp)\nto Cambourne School of Mines, long-standing\nrivals of the Royal School of Mines.\nIn the past, the unfortunate losers of mascots\nhave had to follow a \"treasure hunt\", paying a sum of money for each \"clue\". In a statement,\nPaul Johnson, the VP of RCSU, who is\nresponsible for the Union's mascot ry, and it is\nrumoured, master mined the whole plot to kidnap\nthe lamp, said \"We will be organising a treasure\nhunt as usual, but of course we have had to allow\nfor inflation and today's high price of brass, 1\nmean, Davy's worth \u00a3500 for scrap\".\nThe only hope now for the bereaved Miners is\nto steal RCSU's as yet un violated mascot\n\"Theta\" (a large thermometer), but that doesn't appear to be an easy task, especially as a large\nnumber of Miners will be committed to a photo-session at Westminster tonight, when RCSU will\nbe bringing Theta to their annual dinner.\nNo. 582 Friday May 1,1981 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "The Easter period saw the unveiling of several\ninteresting films. For those with time to spare\nhere is a brief round up.\nIn Superman II (A, Richard Lester) a trio of\nKryptonian super villains are set against the\nman of steel, each with powers equal to his own.\nNeedless to say, Superman eventually triumphs, but not before enduring a titanic\nbattle on the streets of New York. The film\nmaintains a pace which Superman, The Movie\nlacked (as much \"scene setting\" was required)\nand is one of the few sequels which is actually\nmore enjoyable than the original.\nIncidentally, the first Superman film will\nbe shown by ENTS next Thursday.\nThe surprise film, for me, was Chariots Of\nFire (A, Hugh Hudson), the story of two\nBritish athletes (Harold Abrahams and Eric\nLiddell) who both wish to win the 100m gold\nmedal at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games. Now\nthis may sound a fairly dry subject but it is\npresented wit ha style and refreshing enthusiasm that makes it tremendously enjoyable. Abrahams, a Jew, was spurred on to eventual\nvictory by a strong undercurrent of racism\nand eventually became a leading figure in\nBritish athletics for fifty years. Lidell, a devout\nChristian, caused a sensation when he refused\nto compete in the 100m heats because they\nwere on a Sunday. Not surprisingly, there is a certain amount of pomposity and glorified\npatriotism included which suit the period well\n\u2014 this adds the to the feeling of authenticity.\nHighly recommended.\nRoman Polanski's Tess (A) is an epic (two\nhours and 51mins) adaptation of Thomas Hardy's romance Tess of the D 'Urbervilles. I found, however much one could admire\nPolanski's excellent direction and visual sense\nit was difficult to maintain interest in the plot\nfor the entire film. I'm sure that Polanski has\ndirected true to the novel but I can't help\nfeeling that pace was sacrificed for accuracy.\nThe film still stands head and shoulders above\nmost of the usual rubbish thrown onto cinema\nscreens, but you may find Thomas Hardy just\na little too boring.\nThe live action debut of Popeye (U, Robert\nAltman) turned out to be a real mixed bag. The\ncasting of Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelly\nDuval as Olive Oyl was inspired, along with\nmany more of the cast. The film is a semi-musical, with songs by Nilsson, and follows the\nadventures of the anvil-armed sailor as he\narrives at Sweethaven in search of his long lost\npapp y.At first it is almost impossible to\ndiscern a word that anyone says, but as the\nfilm gathers momentum things become easier.\nOverall, though, it is a brave attempt to\ntransform a comic-strip character which never\nquite succeeds. Despite some wonderful\nmoments it is a somewhat confusing mix of the\ntraditional elements. Even spinach doesn't appear until the very end!\nMark Smith\nScanners\nDavid Cronenberg's latest film Scanners (he\nmade Shivers, Rabid and The Brood) will\nappeal only to those who enjoyed his last three\nfilms. According to box office takings \u2014 that's a LOT of people!\nScanners are people versed in the art of ESP and telepathy to such an extent that their\nthoughts can kill . . . often with mind-blowing\n(ha! ha!) special effects that are truly\nspectacular. There is more of a story-line to\nScanners than in Mr Cronenberg's previous\nfilms, which seemed to be mostly a catalogue\nof distasteful effects. However, devotees of\nbad taste in films such as myself are not to be\ndisappointed as Scanners is Mr Cronenberg's most vile film to date!\nScanners is certainly not a \"great\" film such\nas David Lynch's Eraserhead (he later made\nElephant Man) which is probably the most\ndisgusting film ever conceived, but it is\nnevertheless immensely entertaining. It is both\nsuspenseful and reasonably well filmed, however the acting ability of the main star Vale\n(Stephen Lack \u2014 a good name!) leaves a little\nto be desired. But no worry, the chief bad die, Revok (Michael Ironside), makes up for this in\nsheer viciousness. Patrick McG ooh an is in it\ntoo \u2014 this is one of the few films he has made\nsince his Prisoner days; God know's why he\nbothered!\nVale performs Bernie Winters impressions while\nbeing scanned.\nOne point I feel is worth mentioning is that\nthe SOUND effects in the film are, I found,\nquite sickening. I will remember the awful\nstraining of telepathic brains for a long time.\nSo, if you want to have the full alpha-wave\nscrambling experience \u2014 see Scanners at a cinema with a decent sound system.\nIf you enjoy this kind of thing (goes without\nsaying, really) go and be scanned now! \u2014 it's one of the few films that made my stomach feel\na trifle queasy \u2014 especially during that awful\nfifteen minute sequence near the end. (Christ!\nWhat a way to recommend a film!)\nSteve Marshall\nTheatre\nMrKDRrllvl\nTHE HAM DRAM FINAL, advertised as the\n\" Home Counties National Festival Final\", transpired to be five one act plays from thi book Plays For Coarse Acting by Michael\nGreen. The plays were performed by Imper al\nCollege Dramsoc in the Union Concert Hill. Ironically the plays were caricatures of the\ntypical amateur dramatic play, exaggerating all\nthe things that go wrong in such home made\nefforts.\nIn 'Streuth' disasters such as doors jamming\nand scenery collapsing were executed with\nhilarious results. The actors had the difficult\ntask of playing the part of the amateur playing\nthe part, which they did very successfully.\nChris Barton delivered his lines in 'Streuth'\nmarvellously, with the conviction and feeling\nof a ham sandwich. Good performances were\nalso given by Mark Wilson in 'The CherrySisters' as a thoroughly disgusting hunchbacked butler, Piles, and Mike Pick-up, who\ngave a marvellously over the top performance\nas a Richard the Third type mad duke, in the\nShakespearian spoof 'Alls Well That Ends As\nYou Like It'.\nThe other plays performed were 'II\nFornicazione' (The Adulterer), a tragic opera,\nand 'The Colliers Tuesday Tea', a grim Yorkshire tale by HD Lawrence.\nThe whole effect was superb, all that went\nwrong did so to perfection. There was nothing\nhumdrum about Hamdram!\nRecords\nSpandau Ballet\nJourneys to Glory\n(Chrysalis/Reformation)\nFROM THE COVER to the record label, this\nalbum oozes class and style. And like it or\nloath it, the music complements the image\nperfectly.\nAlthough they are landed with the tag of\n'New Romantics', this album shows Spandau\nBallet to be one step ahead of the rather more\nimmature' Futurist' standard bearers. Ironically, the album is produced by Richard\nJames Burgess, former Buggies drummer ar.d currently with another much acclaimed album\nin the charts from his own futurist band \u2014\nLandscape.\nBy the time this is printed Musclebound will\nno doubt have joined The Freeze and To Cut\nA Long Story Short as former high flyers ii the\nsingles charts, aided by a video which cost\nmore to produce than the whole album. Musclebound is perhaps the most representative of the Spandau sound on this album,\nwith its non-disco dance able rhythm and its\natmosphere ic evocative sound. The lyrics are\nrich in imagery and stronger than any mere\nrock'n 'roll music. But read on\nJourneys To Glory was initially conceived\ntwo years ago and the album was recorded last\nyear. The image of the band is still of central\nimportance \u2014 'hair' comes before 'lighting' in\nthe credits \u2014 but live in the clubs, much of the\novertone is lost to pure and simple pro-fess ional is m. Though the songs are imaginatively reproduced, somehow the atmosphere is\nnot conducive to romanticism and the songs\nare not suitable for cattle pen clubs. To tell you\nthe truth, it's only rock'n 'roll, but I like it\nJohn Miller\nFELIX, May 1, 1981 Page 9\n\n"
