Zooey Deschanel is a splendid ac-tress, able to make any crazy old cat lady look\nadorable. Quite simply very enjoyable and re-laxing. New Girl is 20 minutes of easy (brain-less) entertainment and a good laugh.\nThe sitcom is carried by Deschanel\u2019s performance and is tipped to be one of the most\nexciting new comedies of the year.

So, it was not surprising at\nall that the episode had a 30% audience share.\nYet the show itself was not trashed and the upcoming series finale is certainly worth looking\nforward to.\nThere has been much to look forward to in\nthis series, with last Sunday\u2019s episode revolv-A\nfter a successful first season,\nSherlock is back on our screens.\nGiving the detective stories\na 21st century make-up, the\nsecond season does not disap-point.

    "content": "ago,\u201d she explains \u201cand actually commented then on how the British like to\ndrink to excess. We are talking about\na culture that has been going on for so\nmany years.\u201d\nAnd at university, of course, the\npressure to drink is even more pro-nounced. Moira Plant, Professor of Alcohol studies, University of West England, feels that the culture of alcohol\nis even more prevalent in University,\n\u201cIt\u2019s really very difficult, particularly\nfor younger people, not to drink because university cultures are drinking cultures. People at times perceive\npeople who don\u2019t drink as \u2018no fun\u2019: as\npeople to be suspicious of.\u201d We spoke\nto Verana, a teetotal student at Imperial, who explained that there is \u201csome\npressure to drink, but generally people\nare happy when you just explain your\nchoice\u201d.\nThese ideas ring true when looking at\nan average night out the town \u2013 drinking is practically a must. Unfortunately, the amount can lead to people ending up in hospital. Dr Zul Mirza, A&E\nConsultant in West Middlesex University Hospital gives Felix his take:\n\u201cthe NHS sees twice as many twice as\nmany alcohol patients as 10 years ago;\nand British teens are the worst binge\ndrinkers in Europe \u2013 of all 15-24 year\nold deaths, alcohol contributes to 1 in\n4.\u201d He also highlighted the effect of\npeer pressure leading to previous nondrinkers conforming to fit in.\nThe College of Emergency Medicine\nattributes in part the affordability of\nalcohol as there are studies showing\nthe strong positive correlation between\ncheap alcohol and excessive use. In su-permarkets, it is sold at less than cost\nprice and as Brigid Simmonds Chief\nExecutive of the British Beer and Pub\nAssociation tells us \u201cAlmost 70% of\nall alcohol is bought in supermarkets.\u201d\nThis was has been further exacerbated\nby the 24 hour licensing reform, which\nrather than encouraging French caf\u00e9\nculture and pacing how alcohol was\ndrunk, merely increased availability\nand enabled alcoholics.\nWhile the notion of alcohol being\nbad for your health exists, it is seen\nas relatively safe in large amounts,\nunlike other easily available drugs\nI\nt\u2019s that time of year again when\nwe all start to make, and consequently break, all those well-meant resolutions we dreamt up\nover the Christmas break. But\none resolution that couldn\u2019t afford to\nbe broken was that made by Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine (ICSM)\nthis time last year: its anniversary\nmarked by ICSM\u2019s inaugural \u2018Alcohol\nAwareness Week\u2019, a series of events\ndesigned to highlight the dangers students face by abusing alcohol. Here,\nFelix investigates the binge drinking\nculture of our universities, and asks\nwhat, if anything, can be done.\nAlcohol to most British people\ncomes part and parcel with socialis-ing. It\u2019s just normal to have a couple\nof pints or a few glasses of wine when\nmeeting with friends. Peter Marsh,\nCo-director of The Social Issues Research Centre tells us how the culture\nof drinking is a fundamental part of\nour collective psyche. \u201cThe British\nidentity [\u2026] has rested on its drinking\nhabits and drinking reputation. The use\nof alcohol is central to most of our celebratory rituals \u2013 to marriages, births\nand even deaths.\u201d\nAnd, according to Sibohan McCann\nof Drink Aware, this is far from a modern problem. \u201cA King of Norway came\nto visit Britain thousands of years\nlike paracetamol. Unfortunately, this\nis not the case. Like an overdose of\nparacetamol in a short period of time\ncan damage your liver and cause you\nto die, acute alcohol poisoning can do\nthe same. Furthermore, taking in a lot\nof alcohol over a short period of time\ncan raise you blood concentrations. If\nthis reaches 300mg/L, you will become\nunconscious, lose your gag reflex and\naspirate vomit. If you\u2019re lucky, it will\ngive you pneumonia. If you\u2019re not,\nyou\u2019ll suffer an hypoxic cardiac arrest\n- hardly the best way to end a night out.\nIt is not only in the short term alcohol is dangerous. Excessive consumption over a sustained period can lead\nto portal hypertension, bleeding of the\nstomach and vomiting up blood. This\nis the commonest presentation of alcoholism and alcoholic damage to the\nliver in the \u201csilent middle classes\u201d who\ndo not arrive in hospital until the damage has become permanent. This insidious onset is due to the apparently\nharmless act of sharing a bottle of wine\neach evening with a partner. Whilst the\nimage of a homeless vagabond with\na few cans of Tennant\u2019s is the stereotypical image of an alcoholic, this is\na problem that spans all ages, genders\nand classes.\nBut why do students in particular\nfall into alcohol abuse? The answer\nof course is multi-factorial, however,\nDr Mirza suggests part of the reason\nmight lie in personality type. Students at Imperial are largely Type A,\nmeaning that they exhibit traits like\nperfectionism, highly competitive na-tures, time urgency, and a predisposition to stress. Dr Mirza stressed that\nit was the responsibility of the student,\nthough, to find outlets for their stress\nthat don\u2019t involve alcohol. Currently,\nthough, \u2018there is a lack of understanding about how to deal with the pressure\u2019.\nSo why should students care? The\nhealth and professional consequences\nof binge drinking are well known - but\nit is not widely appreciated that drink-ing, even in small amounts, can seriously affect academic performance.\nThere is some evidence that \u2018one\nnight of heavy binge drinking will impair your abstract thinking for up to\n30 days\u2019. That includes your reading\ncomprehension, ability to understand\nwhat your lectures say to you, and\nproblem solving abilities. It is a widely\nheld belief that a person can have one\nor two drinks and behave completely\nnormally, however, this is untrue- a\npersons ability to think normally could\nbe impaired \u2018right from the first sip\u2019.\nNot such a problem on a night out, but\nif the effects are as long lasting as sug-gested, students who regularly binge\ndrink will face serious academic repercussions (not to mention significant\nfinancial cost.)This idea is reflected in\nthe significant number of freshers in\nthe UK who drop out of their courses\nevery year due to alcohol related prob-lems.\nBut what can be done about the prob-lem? Part of the problem is confusion\nover guidelines. Officially, the NHS\nadvices men to drink no more than\n21 units a week, and women no more\nthan 14. However, this often misleads\npeople into thinking that it is healthy\nto drink every day, which of course it\nisn\u2019t. It has been suggested this week\nin a report by the Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee that\nwe should abstain from alcohol for\nat least 2 days a week. An interesting\nproposal, but doesn\u2019t all this conflicting advice confuse the general public\nover what is a healthy amount of alcohol to consume. Dr Mirza thinks so,\nand called for \u2018clear guidelines and one\nmessage\u2019 over alcohol intake.\nIn terms of what universities should\nbe doing, education is a major compo-nent. Initiatives like \u2018Alcohol Awareness\u2019 week are fantastic at highlighting\nthe problems associated with excessive\ndrinking. However, Mirza recognises\nthe importance of avoiding seeming\n\u2018dictatorial or Machiavellian\u2019 when\nguiding people about their alcohol intake .\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to stop people having fun, we just want to encourage sensible and responsible drinking.\u201d\nAlcohol: why should you care?\nMadhura Ghosh and Katy Bettany investigate binge drinking culture\n\u201cOne night of bingeing will impair your\nabstract thinking for\n30 days \u201d\n\u201c159,000 freshers in\nthe UK will drop out\nof their courses due\nto alcohol\u201d\nFELIX\nFriday 13 january 2012\n10\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nFEATURES\nImperial College\nAdvice Centre\nImperial College\nHealth Centre\nAlcoholics\nAnonymous\nWorried?\nIf you are worried about\nyour alcohol intake, there\nare plenty of places to\nseek help and advice.\n10am \u2013 5pm weekdays,\nMezzanine Level of the Union\nBuilding\n8am \u2013 6pm weekdays, Tuesdays 8am \u2013 1pm, 6:30pm\n\u2013 8pm (Pre-booked Appointments Only)\nwww.alcoholics-anonymous.\norg.uk\nImperial College London\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nOverlooked DVD of the week\nWhy this important, superior thriller only made the\ndirect-to-DVD release is anyone\u2019s guess but The\nWhistleblower, one woman\u2019s quest for justice in\nwhich she has to go after a powerful group of in-dividuals, may sound familiar and predictable, but\nanchored by a strong lead performance, assured\ndirection and a solid script, is an unmissable treat.\nBased on a true story (aren\u2019t they always?), we\nfirst meet Kathryn Bolkovac (Weisz), a Nebraska\ncop, as she takes on a job for Democra Corp,\nan American private military company, to travel\nto post-war Bosnia, where she is to assist the\npeace-keeping operations overseen by the United\nNations.\nAlthough this new opportunity is well-paid and\nfilled with excitement at first, she soon uncovers a\nmajor sex-trafficking ring in which even underage\ngirls are forced into prostitution. At first, Bolkovac\nonly suspects the local police and the military of\nbeing responsible. But as she digs deeper, she\ndiscovers a long list of clientele that includes\nnames of high-level diplomats, as well as those\nemployed in the U.N.\nBolkovac is far from perfect, and is way in over\nher head trying to tackle the world\u2019s biggest, most\nrespected organisation. But the one thing she\nknows better than anyone is right and wrong. Rape\nis wrong. Human trafficking is wrong.\nWeisz, in one of her most unforgettable per-formances, is masterful in balancing the many\ncomplex emotions of her character as she is put\nthrough all sorts of obstacles. Compassion and\nanger are what drive our heroine; the former for\nthe abused girls, and the latter towards the high-power officials arrogant and corrupt enough to believe that they can get away with anything.\nWhat sets The Whistleblower apart from similar\nthemed films is how personal and sensitive the\nfilm\u2019s narrative is. Bolkovac travels alone, mostly\nin the dark, risking her life in order to finish what\nshe rightfully started. By using her vulnerability,\nit reels you in, and is more than effective in setting up a cruel, menacing atmosphere of the real\nworld. And being such a character-driven drama,\nit walks that fine line of addressing the important\nkey issues with confidence and passion, all the\nwhile not succumbing to too much preachy tone.\nIt has a gentle, well-balanced mix of drama and\nthriller, in which neither aspect is overplayed. It\u2019s\na much-needed wake-up call for us all, reminding\nus of the world we live in.\nThe Whistleblower is released on January 16\nPhyllida Lloyd is a special director. But I mean\nthis as no compliment. With her skills behind the\ncamera, she has managed the almost impossible.\nShe made a Meryl Streep movie almost unwatch-able.\nOpening with a hallucinatory Margaret Thatcher(Streep),inwhichshebelievesherdeadhusband\nDennis (Jim Broadbent) is still alive, the film is already starting to show that it has its focus in all the\nwrong places. It is heart-breaking for the audience\ntolearnthatshehaslostsomeonedeartoherheart,\nand the devastating consequences this has had on\nher life, but it\u2019s certainly not something we want\nto come back to too frequently. Perhaps trying to\nsqueeze as many tears out of us as possible, Lloyd\nis strangely eager to show the current Thatcher,\ninstead of closely examining the rise of a great\nleader, her politics, and her eventual decline.\nSure, we have the flashbacks. We even see a\nyounger version of Margaret played by the perky\nAlexandra Roach. It\u2019s unclear why Lloyd even\nbothered with this segment, for this part serves no\npurpose to the later parts of the film. It moves too\nquickly, and barely glances over her family. Her\ndistant mother and her politically driven father are\nscarcely shown, and appear to have had very little\ninfluenceonher.Thenwehearthehappynewsthat\nshe got accepted into Oxford. Margaret soon runs\nfor a seat in the Parliament. So what happened in\nOxford? Apparently, not much. Through her first\nelection, she meets Dennis, a charming young\nbusinessman who wants to marry her. They bond\nover The King and I. As he proposes, she declares\nthat she won\u2019t \u201cdie washing teacups.\u201d This kind of\nambition is why he wants to be her husband.\nFine then, this chooses to focus more on the romance between Margaret and Dennis, given the\nway the dead Dennis keeps popping up to trouble\nthe frail Margaret. Not quite; because when politics kicks in, Dennis is forgotten in an instant and\nis shown in rare shots where he\u2019s surrounded by\nfellow conservatives, applauding as Margaret delivers a winning speech. The bond between these\nMust work to \u201clive long and prosper!\u201d\nFELIX\nFriday 13 january 2012\n20\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\ntwo is never explored any further than their mutual love for The King and I, and it becomes increasingly frustrating as we know so very little about\nthe couple. Her children also make an appearance\n\u2013 and although the daughter (the excellent Olivia\nColman) shows up to add more nostalgia, the son\u2019s\nname is barely even called.\nSo has Lloyd suddenly decided, half way\nthrough the film no less, that she does in fact want\nto explore the politics? Again, not quite. Showing all of the leader\u2019s accomplishments in tacky\nscenes containing far too much past real-life foot-age, whereas Streep is required to do no more\nthan a) wave at her supporters or b) look scared\nin her car as angry demonstrators try to climb her\nvehicle, there is hardly any sense of triumph for\nthe remarkable political climb this woman man-aged. The closing of the coalmines, resolution of\nthe Cold War, the IRA prisoners\u2019 hunger strike,\nthe Falklands War etc., are covered poorly, if at all.\nBut one thing is for certain: Streep is, as usual,\nutterly brilliant. This isn\u2019t just about her accent or\nthe voice. Perfect as those two qualities are, Streep\ngoes a step further in showing us the more private\nand ailing Thatcher as well as the characteristics\nof a stern Prime Minister. She is ruthless and stubborn as she addresses her cabinet, often alienating even those close to her, and yet her vulnerable\nsides show through, mostly when it becomes apparent that not having her husband around in later\nlife is unbearable even to the Iron Lady. Opposite\nher, Broadbent is also spot-on, providing a subdued air of warmth, exactly the kind of support\nStreep needs to truly shine.\nLloyd\u2019s direction however, is irritatingly dis-jointed,unevenandmanagestosuckalltheexcite-ment and drama from this extraordinary woman\u2019s\nlife. One wonders what would have happened to\nthis project if Streep had declined the role. As she\nhappens to be the best and only reason to even\nconsider watching this, it would be reasonable\nto assume that without her The Iron Lady would\nhave flopped.\nThis lady\u2019s not for turning\nJohn Park\nDirector Phyllida Lloyd\nScreenwriter Abi Morgan\nCast Meryl Streep, Jim Broadbent\nThe Iron Lady\nJanuary blues and then some\nCheater\u2019s guide to Margin Call\nJohn Park\nDirector J.

All the characters,\nno matter what positions they hold, are shown\nto have vulnerabilities and insecurities of their\nown, even in very brief moments, and their personal struggles coping with the demise of the\nworld economy is a fresh, fair-minded and honest approach in the midst of so much hate and\nanger displayed towards bankers nowadays.\nWhat is shown in Margin Call is what really\nmight have happened in the final days leading\nup to the eventual financial collapse of 2008 that\nhas put the global market in chaos.\nSet in an unnamed but very successful investment firm, as the company\u2019s CEO (the brilliantly\nsly Irons) learns of his troubled investments that\ncan take down his empire in one clean swoop,\nhe makes the corrupt decision to sell off all of\nthe company\u2019s toxic assets, before anyone can\nclose in on his downfall.

    "content": "the perceived \u2018essential\u2019 nature of alcohol at these events. Whilst events for\n\u2018non-drinkers\u2019 have never really taken\noff, I think that ICSM has improved the\nevents to cater for everyone, which is\nwhat we should be aiming for.\nI would like to reiterate Dr Mirza\u2019s\npoint that this Awareness week is an\nexcellent step in the right direction.\nWhat made you decide to arrange an\nAlcohol Awareness week, and will it\nbecome a regular thing for the medical school?\nThe thought to run anAlcoholAware-ness week was initially triggered by\nlast year\u2019s press, and ICSMSU felt that\nit necessary to highlight to students the\nimpact that alcohol (or misuse of it)\ncan have on their careers. I hope that\nit has not come across as an attempt to\ntell people not to drink: that was never\nthe aim. We want to provide the information that people need to allow them\nto make a fully informed decision.\nHuge thanks to Neeraj Kalra, ICSMSU Welfare Officer for leading the\nweek, which I think has been well re-ceived.\nObviously, education is a massive\ncomponent in changing the health\nbehaviours of students, and many\nH\now do you think the\nmedical school has\nchanged since this time\nlast year (with respect\nto the Daily Mail article highlighting the binge-drinking\nculture of ICSM)?\nThe changes made [after] the Daily\nMail article last January have caused\nsome necessary changes to bar behav-iour. The changes have brought the\nbar in line with the ICU responsible\nretailing of alcohol policy which was\nrevised earlier this year. The buckets\nwere removed, alcohol is no longer\nserved in jugs, it has been further highlighted that drunk people will not be\nserved (although this was already an\nexisting rule).\nDo you agree with the opinion\nthat excessive drinking has been ingrained into ICSM\u2019s culture, and if\nso, is this something that needs to\nbe changed? What steps have been\ntaken to improve the issue, and how\nsuccessful have they been?\nWhilst many medical school events\n(across all medical schools, not just\nICSM) have previously had an alcohol\nfocus, I think that a great effort has been\nmade over the last few years to lessen\nstudents may not be aware that\nthey are at risk of seriously damaging their professional and personal\nlives. However, is education enough\n\u2013 do you not think that there needs\nto be more serious repercussions for\nstudents who repeatedly drink exces-sively?\nI think it is crucial to separate the impact of drinking excessively in different\nsituations. Where it is purely impacting\nthe individual, whilst we can educate to\nallow them to know the damage they\nare doing, it is ultimately their decision\n(as long as they have capacity and in-sight). The difference comes when the\nindividual\u2019s alcohol consumption is affecting those around them, whether it is\nfamily, friends or patients.\nHowever, I think what is often missed\nis that alcohol abuse (and ultimately\naddiction) is also a medical problem as\nwell as a social one, and students who\nhave difficulties surrounding alcohol\nneed to be helped through it, and not\nrefuse to tell anyone for fear of re-percussion. I don\u2019t think that punitive\nmeasures are the most productive approach to alcohol misuse.\nHow would you respond to the possible criticism of the ICSMSU about\ncertain members failing to lead by\nexample by drinking responsibly?\nThe ICSMSU Exec, as an elected\nbody, is voted for by all students and is\nrepresentative of the student body.\nICSMSU Exec strive to lead by ex-ample, and we are aware of the impact\nthat alcohol can have in relation to stu-dents.\nA key point of alcohol awareness\nweek is to start to impact upon the perceived drinking culture. I hope that in\na few years time, as a result of campaigns run by ICSMSU amongst oth-ers, we will have managed to change\nthis, but it will be a long process.\nAnd finally, if a student suspects\nthey have a drinking problem, where\nshould be their first point of call for\nhelp? Many students could be reluctant to come forward for fear of\njeopardising themselves professionally \u2013 what would you say to them?\nWithin the university, there are lots of\npoints of call. Obviously, the ICSMSU\nWelfare Officer and I are always available for confidential advice. The senior\nwelfare tutors are also an excellent\nsource of impartial and confidential ad-vice. The counselling service (counsel-ling@ic.ac.uk) provide 8 sessions and\nreferrals for longer term treatment.\n,QYLWLQJ\u0003DOO\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003DQG\u0003VHFRQG\u0003\\HDU\u0003XQGHUJUDGXDWHV\nImperial Horizons\nwww3.imperial.ac.uk/horizons\n:DQW\u0003WR\u0003SXW\u0003\\RXU\u0003GHJUHH\u0003LQ\u0003D\u0003EURDGHU\u0003FRQWH[W\"\u0003\n)DQF\\\u0003KHDULQJ\u0003IURP\u0003WRS\u0003H[SHUWV\u0003IURP\u0003DOO\u0003RYHU\u0003WKH\u0003&ROOHJH\u0003 QRW\u0003MXVW\u0003\\RXU\u0003GHSDUWPHQW \"\n:DQW\u0003WR\u0003HQKDQFH\u0003\\RXU\u0003SURVSHFWV\u0003RI\u0003HPSOR\\PHQW\u0003DIWHU\u0003JUDGXDWLRQ\"\n,QWHUHVWHG\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003VFLHQFH\u0003DQG\u0003SROLWLFV\u0003RI\u0003FOLPDWH\u0003FKDQJH\"\n&KHFN\u0003RXW\u0003WKH\u0003QHZ\u0003,PSHULDO\u0003+RUL]RQV\u0003FRXUVH\u0011\u0003([FOXVLYHO\\\u0003GHYHORSHG\u0003IRU\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003DQG\u0003\nVHFRQG\u0003\\HDU\u0003XQGHUJUDGXDWHV\u0011\nApplication deadline Wednesday 18th January.\u00036HH\u0003RXU\u0003ZHEVLWH\u0003IRU\u0003IXOO\u0003GHWDLOV\u0011\nFEATURES\nFELIX Friday 13 january 2012 11\nthe perceived \u2018essential\u2019 nature of alco-H\now do you think the students may not be aware that\nAn interview with Medic President Suzie Rayner\nLast year\u2019s Daily Mail article\n\n"

    "content": "\u201d\nL\nast term I went to Paris to\nmeet up with a friend who\nis doing a year abroad. Being a man of modest means\nI took the overnight coach,\narriving at the coach station at 5am. My\nfriend was arriving by the first train from\nClermont Ferrand at about 8am, which\nmeant I got to spend two and a half hours\nwaiting in Gare Du Lyon with nothing but\nan incredibly expensive coffee and a copy\nof The Economist for company. Growing\nquickly bored of The Economist I took up\npeople watching. What struck me most\nwas the fact that the police in France,\neven the guys in the transport police, are\narmed. Every officer had a handgun and\nwhat looked like a Taser. Several of the\nofficers, when they were just standing\naround, even rested their hands on their\nweapons in some bad-ass John Wayne\npose. This made me feel exceptionally\nuncomfortable. The preceding 12 months\nat home had consisted of bungled policing of student protests, UK uncut demonstrations and the summer riots; which,\ncoupled with my intrinsic whinging\nliberal outlook on life, had left me very\ndistrustful of the police. Not for the first\ntime that weekend, I found myself feeling\na little homesick. Our police can at times\nbe rubbish, racist idiots, but at least they\ncan\u2019t blow our brains out.\nHowever, one aspect where law enforcement in the country still infuriates\nme though is the ubiquity of surveillance.\nPrimarily due to the CCTV network established in response to the actions of\nthe IRA in the 1970s and 80s, the British are the most watched nation on earth.\nAlthough fantastic at providing security\nby allowing for suspicious vehicles and\nabandoned packages to be detected, the\ncrime fighting merits of closed circuit\ntelevision are far from clear to me. By\nhaving cameras everywhere, all you are\ndoing to criminals is suggesting that they\nperhaps wear a hat. Personal experience\nMatt Allinson\nFeminists need to man up\nBig Brother is watching you\nas a victim of a crime has resulted in me\nhearing a variety of excuses on CCTV\u2019s\nbehalf, such as being in a camera blind-spot, the tape having already been wiped\nand, the most ridiculous excuse I ever\nheard after the assault of a friend, that the\ncamera didn\u2019t work in the rain. In much\nthe same way I cannot understand why\nthe French seem to tolerate their police\nofficers being able to utilise lethal force\nat the drop of a hat, I cannot understand\nwhy we in this country don\u2019t seem to care\nabout CCTV. A woman whose husband\nwas assaulted so violently in a nightclub\nin Wakefield that he now requires 24 hour\ncare has called for CCTV to be mandatory in nightclubs and bars and an article\non her campaign even made the BBC\nmost read section \u2013 admittedly on a rather\nslow news day between Boxing Day and\nNew Year\u2019s Eve. With all due respect to a\nperson who has been subject to a terrible\ninjustice, how would CCTV have helped?\nEven in the unlikely event that the cameras were working, what would they have\nprovided? More footage of her husband\ngetting attacked from several angles, per-haps, but not much more. CCTV doesn\u2019t\nmake people behave better, it just means\nwe get to watch them behave badly. Most\nworryingly, the article on her campaign\nshe is quoted as saying \u201cIf you get the\nBig Brother effect within the clubs then\naggression, when it is spotted, can be\nstopped before it goes any further.\u201d\nNow, as I stated previously, I have a\nwhinging liberal outlook on life. Quoting the phrase \u201cBig Brother\u201d as a force\nfor the public good has made me sweat\nso much that it\u2019s made the ink run on the\ncopy of the Guardian I was reading. Close\nfriends of mine will appreciate the irony\nof me complaining about privacy when I\nam eternally logged into at least one and\nusually three social media websites at any\ngiven moment, but the difference between\nsocial media and \u201cBig Brother\u201d is impor-tant. That difference is engagement. Big\nI\nam writing from the kitchen, the\nplace where my family believe I\nbelong, having given me an apron,\ntea towels, cookbooks and sponges\nfor Christmas. Feminism is committing suicide. Last week, the BBC\u2019s\nadaptation ofArthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock was criticised for being sexist. In\nmy opinion, this was another example of\nwhere feminism is going wrong by creating bad press. The allegations were purely\nbased on a far-fetched interpretation of the\nlast fifteen minutes of the show.\nItisnotbecauseawomantakes\u201cadvice\u201d\nfrom a man, has feelings for another and\nis saved from being beheaded by him that\nshe is a \u201cpawn \u201c in the game of men or the\nweaker sex. The ending was criticised for\nbeing changed from Irene Adler\u2019s victory\nin the original story to her losing against\nthe Holmes brothers. That is quite simply\ncalled dramatization for entertainment\u2019s\npurpose. Adler greets the famous detective in the full nude, giving away the code\nto her safe (her measurements \u2013 obviously\na key factor in a woman\u2019s worth). It was\nsexy, not sexist.\nFeminists are slowly becoming repeat\noffenders in this area, following Apple\u2019s\nSiri scandal in the USA. Picking up on\nsmall details, over-interpreting them and\nthen proceeding to make a big deal out of\nit. This is not helping their cause whatso-ever. The point is to obtain the same rights\nand opportunities for women as those\navailable to men. Then again, when the\nvoices of feminism come across as those\nof hormonal, loud, strongly opinionated\nbeings picking at mere details, the result\ncan only be negative. The stereotype of an\nactive feminist is that of an angry lesbian\nwith half her hair shaved off. Men mock\nwomen for being overemotional, irratio-nal, picky and constantly moaning. How\ncan you expect to improve that image and\nBrother not only requires passivity in its\nsubjects, but, in both Orwell\u2019s books and\nin practice on our camera-laden streets,\nactively encourages it. Social media, how-ever, is all about being active. One has to\ncheck into Foursquare, tweet about a TV\nshow or post a photograph of where we are\non Tumblr for our privacy to be violated.\nBrits are enormously famous for being a little bit passive about everything.\n\u201cMustn\u2019t Grumble,\u201d is more than a phrase\nfor us, it\u2019s a way of life. However, I feel\nthat in public disorder and crime we are\ndangerously over-passive. Daring heroics by impromptu crime-fighters are an\nAmerican comic book invention. A British comic book hero would probably be\n\u2018Loud Tutting and Head Shaking Man\u2019.\nHave you seen the Croydon Tram video\non YouTube? While most comment on\nthe video focuses expressly on the reprehensible subject and her words and\nideas, a large amount of mention is given\nto the woman, pictured at the end of the\nfilm, determinedly playing a game on her\nphone desperately trying not to look up\nor play any part in the fuss taking place\naround her. It is important to note, how-ever, that the infamous Croydon Tram\nlady wasn\u2019t apprehended on the basis of\nprospects of women with behavous such\nas this? In that case, they may just as well\nsurrender to sexism and go back to their\novens.Aform of extremism is developing\nin feminism. This might be the worst service rendered to the cause because its portrayal is so bad. So instead of depreciating\nthe general view of the fairer sex, feminists should calm down, take a step back\nand concentrate on real issues. Like the\n\u201cReclaim the Night\u201d campaign (fighting\nagainst sexual crimes and for safer streets\nat night). Not a BBC TV drama that pictures a strong woman, \u201cTHE Woman\u201d,\nproving to be Sherlock Holmes\u2019equal.\nBy having cameras\neverywhere, all\nyou are doing\nto criminals is\nsuggesting that they\nperhaps wear a hat.\nBy havin\nBy havin\nh\nevidence gathered by the no doubt rather\nexpensive CCTV systems that have been\ninstalled throughout the TfL network,\nbut rather through evidence obtained via\na YouTube video. Mike Skinner, leader\nof British chart sensation The Streets,\nonce complained on \u2018When You Wasn\u2019t\nFamous\u2019: \u201cHow am I supposed to do a\nline [of coke] in front of complete strangers when I know they\u2019ve all got camera\nphones?\u201d\nI\u2019m not saying that we should screw\nthe system and start tweeting parking\noffenses in lieu of traffic wardens and\npost our location on Foursquare if we\nsee an unattended bag, but the constant\nencroachment of state cameras into our\nlives is unnecessary. The general public\nnow has the means to capture high quality footage of crimes being committed,\nrendering patchy, expensive and liberty\ninfringing surveillance systems obsolete.\nWhat\u2019s more, encouraging the public to\ntake a more active role in recording and\nreporting crime could be seen by the \u201cbig\nsociety\u201d conservatives as strengthening\nthe community. Our police are no more\nheavily armed than us, and our closely\nmatched ability to document crime\nstrengthens our liberty once more.\nItalian police have guns, but more importantly, style and swagger\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nCOMMENT\nFELIX Friday 13 january 2012 15\n\n"

Yet regardless of\nhow appealing a shearling lined boot may\nsound, we must remember and endeavour to live through the famous quote: \u2018no\npain, no gain\u2019. Now girls, that is not to\nsay that we should start sacrificing our\nfeet every day, but it really is time to\nditch those monstrosities, better known\nas Ugg Boots. Even the name of these\nclumpy sheepskin clad slippers gives off\na repulsive sound \u2013 so throw them to the\nlandfill where they belong and instead invest in a good pair of leather boots. Not\nonly will these keep your feet warm, but\nthey\u2019ll also keep them dry \u2013 without the\nuse of \u2018care kits\u2019. Break the bank and\nbag a pair of elegant leg extending Rick\nOwens wedge boots or opt for a less demanding pair of ankle boots from Office.\nWith so many choices out there that\neliminate \u2018fat calf syndrome\u2019 and guarantee you walk upright (as opposed to\non the side of your Ugg), this resolution\nwill not only improve your posture but will\nalso help you give off a more sophisticated look.\nGUYS: T under V is never good\nShould you be reading this issue of Felix prior to catching sight of your own reflection for the first time today, fear not\nbecause the t-shirt under the v-neck is\na fashion pit that Justin Timberlake, Gordon Ramsay and even Brad Pitt have\nfallen into. However, lets make this clear\nonce and for all, a round neck protruding\ninconspicuously from under a sharp V,\nespecially in clashing colours, is identical to hanging a sign around one\u2019s neck\nreading \u201cI blindly picked what I\u2019m wearing\noff my floor this morning\u201d \u2013 also known\nas a big red warning sign to your female\ncounterparts regarding your sense of\nstyle.\nNow boys, your mother did not buy you\nv-neck sweaters in a desperate attempt\nto wean you out of your hoodies and\nband-ts just to see their efforts ruined\nby such carelessness. Instead, make the\nconscious decision (preferably starting\nas soon as possible) to match a smart\nshirt with your v-neck. Should this look\nbe too formal for you, a casual shirt is\na wardrobe staple for the modern man\nand with the high street offering such a\nplethora of styles and patterns; you really are spoilt for choice.\nGIRLS: VPLs no more\nThe return of the 70s has landed with us\nrecently in the form of glitter and gold,\nyet not all the looks from the decade are\nones to copy, and topping the list are the\nunsightly sight of VPLs \u2013 most commonly\nseen under excessively tight lower wear.\nLeggings/jeggings/treggings, regardless of what you call them, undeniably\nhave their uses \u2013 thicker than tights, and\nwith the ability to sit perfectly under long\ntops without the need of shorts. However, the unfortunate fact is, too many\nhave been ignoring the word \u2018long\u2019 prior\nto \u2018top\u2019, resulting in what can only be described as flashing the world a disturbing\npeek down where-the-sun-don\u2019t-shine.\nSo should your backside be perfectly\npert, I am by no means preventing you\nfrom giving the male population their\neye candy, but for those wishing to keep\ntheir dignity having indulged somewhat\nmore humanly over the break on comfort\nfood instead of trips to the gym, opt to\ndress with a lengthy shimmering top \u00e0\nla Kate Moss in vintage Chanel or perhaps throw on a pair of treggings under\nthis season\u2019s favourite large jumper for\nan overall cosier effect as seen on Rumi\nNeely.\nGUYS: Roll long sleeves, burn short sleeves\nReferring to formal short-sleeved shirts\nas opposed to the standard t-shirt, this\nsection is the start of an attempt to ban\nthe wearing of such items. If you are not\nyet aware of the risks of wearing such\npieces \u2013 they hang on even the hunkiest\nof men in the most unflattering manner,\nthen perhaps it is time you cleared out\nyour wardrobe out and indulged in what\nwomen call \u2018retail therapy\u2019.\nThe hatred towards these shirts arises\nbecause not only are they cut out in the\nshape of square for some mysterious\nreason meaning that wearers are expected to be as wide as they are tall, but they\nalso posses the most ridiculous loose\nflappy sleeves. Not quite as short as on a\nt-shirt but most definitely not full length,\nthese sleeves hobble somewhat uncertainly around the elbow so that even the\nmost gym-loving biceps seem somewhat\nlanky and lacking in substance.\nMake a new resolution for life to avoid\nsuch items and instead opt for rolling up\nthe sleeves on your long sleeved shirt in\nwarmer conditions.

The Vice-Provost for Medical Affairs and Head of the School of Medicine\nat Trinity College Dublin since 2006,\nProfessor Kelleher is to take up the role\non October 1 2012.\nFollowing Professor Sir Anthony\nNewman Taylor, who has been Principal\nsince December 2010, Trinity College\ngraduate Professor Kelleher will direct\nthe Faculty of Medicine\u2019s activities and\nbe a member of the College\u2019s Management Board, which acts as the senior\ndecision-making body.\nRector Sir Keith O\u2019Nions welcomes\nthe appointment, saying \u201cProfessor\nKelleher is an international leader, with\nan outstanding record in academic medi-cine. His emphasis on translating research discoveries from the laboratory to\nfrontline patient care fits perfectly with\nImperial\u2019s vision, and I am delighted to\nwelcome him to the College.\u201d\nOriginally a gastroenterologist by trade\nand now a pioneer in the field of immune\nresponse and infectious diseases Professor Kelleher\u2019s research involves examining the immune response to many of the\nleading causes of gastrointestinal infectious diseases worldwide such as Helicobacter pylori and Clostridium difficile.\nOne aspect of his work is on lymphocyte\nfunction in the body\u2019s reaction to infectious agents and inflammatory diseases\nlike inflammatory bowel disease.\nIn 2002 Professor Kelleher helped to\nobtain collaborative grant funding to\nestablish the not-for-profit company,\nDublin Molecular Medicine Centre\n(now Molecular Medicine Ireland),\nwhich supports medical biotechnology\ndevelopment in Ireland. Its aim was to\naccelerate the translation of biomedical\nresearch into improved diagnostics and\ntherapies for patients.

This will\ninclude four blocks of studios providing\naccommodation for 606 postgraduate\nstudents, alongside some family apartments for Imperial researchers, lecturers and trainee doctors. It is envisioned\nto be ready by late summer 2012. The\nstudios will form part of a new Imperial College campus \u2013 Imperial West\n\u2013 which will ultimately include new research and teaching facilities and management offices for the College as well\nas a 34-storey residential tower.\nThe proposals for the second phase\n\u2018masterplan\u2019 of construction at Imperial West include an open landscaped\nsquare the size of Soho Square that is\nopen to the public, a four-star hotel,\nretail services, a pharmacy, healthcare\nservices and a nursery.\nThe site aims to incorporate \u201cworldclass facilities\u201d for the Imperial School\nof Public Health, which will be located\non the site. The College hopes that the\nsite will enable the College to achieve\nits ambition of providing accommodation for a quarter of post-graduate stu-dents, alongside the new Griffon Studios at Clapham Junction. In addition,\nthe site will operate close to Imperial\u2019s\nHammersmith Campus, and will offer a chance to \u201cexplore collaborative\nwork with the BBC\u201d due to the close\nproximity to the BBC\u2019s Media Village.\nThey also anticipate that the new site\nwill attract budding entrepreneurs as a\nplace to start their business as well as\ncreating 2500 jobs and a boost for local\nbusiness.\nThe \u201cnew safe and secure green open\nspace\u201d proposed by Imperial West aims\nto be as environmentally friendly as\npossible both when building the site\nand once it is completed. They are to\ntake a \u201cgreen approach\u201d by having a\nbio-climatic design, using low energy\nand carbon and minimalizing the use of\ntransport between campuses by providing a shuttle-bus.\nJohn Anderson, Project Director for\nImperial West has said of the project:\n\u201cImperial West will enable the College to expand upon the success of its\nSouth Kensington site to create a sec-ond, open access academic campus that\nprovides the physical infrastructure\nfor world-class research and teaching,\nleading-edge facilities for business development and technology transfer, and\ncreate an attractive environment to live\nand work in.\u201d\nHowever, the plans have not met\nwidespread approval, with the St Helens Residents Association in North\nKensington launching the \u2018Imperial\u2019s\nFolly\u2019 campaign in October 2011.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX Friday 13 january 2012 5\nThe topic of Fisher Hall\u2019s closure in\nEvelyn Gardens has been revived after\na planning permission request from the\ncollege aiming to shift the building\u2019s\nuse from Halls of Residence to Care\nHousing was granted.\nThe request, put forth by both Imperial College and The Wellcome Trust,\nwas approved on December 9 2011\nalong with proposed development to\nthe affected buildings at 24 and 26 Evelyn Gardens such as removal of the\nfront steps, the insertion of windows\nand the erection of chimneys.\nThe review began in January 2011\nand it was speculated that the high cost\nof refurbishment would lead to the closure of the hall. The planning application was submitted in July 2011 indicating the intent to switch to use the hall\nfor elderly care, citing the creation of\nhalls at Prince\u2019s Gardens as causing\nthe \u201cneed for student accommodation\n[to be] reduced\u201d.\nThe cheapest standard single room at\nEastside, the newest halls at Prince\u2019s\nGardens, is currently \u00a3175.34 per week,\nwhile the cheapest for Fisher is \u00a399.56.\nConverting Fisher to a care home\nwould cause the 156 existing beds to\nbe turned into 28 housing units. Last\nyear\u2019s Union President, Alex Kendall\ntold Felix that the decision appeared\n\u201cdriven by cost-cutting\u201d, adding Fisher\nHall \u201cis in urgent need of refurbishment\nand Imperial are less likely to lose money if it is sold on rather than retained as\nstudent accommodation.\u201d\nJane Neary, Director of Commercial\nServices, told Felix last year that the\nproblem with halls such as Fisher lies\nwith the condition of the buildings, and\nthat they \u201chave had no financial investment for as long as anyone can remember\u201d, but she denied claims that Fisher\nwas below standard, saying \u201cit\u2019s not\nthat [the hall isn\u2019t] good enough, it\u2019s\ncompletely legal\u201d, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve\ndone all the urgent work\u201d.\nThere is a period of under 38 years\nleft on the lease for Fisher Hall, after\nwhich time it reverts to the freeholders,\nthe Wellcome Trust. John Anderson,\nCEO of the College Fund, told Felix\nlast year that \u201cCollege is going to be\nlooking at an 8-figure sum to refurbish\nFisher Hall to achieve the standard\nof other halls. To my mind, it simply\ndoesn\u2019t make sense to invest that much\nmoney into a property for which the\nlease expires in 38 years\u201d.\nThe College are continuing the search\nfor new sites of accommodation which\nwould take over as an alternative, and\nwere reported to not be seeking a solution through private halls. Felix contacted the Head of Commercial Business and Student Support, Charles\nGallagher, who stated that College\ntakes into account Fisher Hall as a\n\u201ccore building\u201d which \u201ccurrently remains part of the undergraduate accommodation portfolio\u201d. He said that \u201cthe\ninvestment needed to keep the building\nfully operational as a student resident\nmay not be feasible\u201d, adding \u201cthe College is exploring options for developing the undergraduate accommodation\noffer\u201d.\n\u201cUntil an alternative facility is found\nthat offers suitable accommodation\u201d,\nhe continued, \u201cFisher Hall will remain\na student residence and a core asset for\nCollege\u201d. The planning proposal for\nPermission granted for Fisher Hall development\nconverting Fisher from a hall to a care\nhome, however, was approved with the\ncondition that \u201cthe development shall\nbe begun before the expiration of three\nyears from the date of permission\u201d as\nrequired by Section 91 of the Town and\nCountry Planning Act 1990, to avoid\nthe accumulation of unexercised planning permissions.\nAlexander Karapetian\nSimon Kreitem\n\u201cnew sites would provide an alternative\u201d The proposals would see new care housing at Evelyn Gardens\n\n"

    "content": "In brief\nScientists have developed the most advanced\nmodel yet of the weather system on Titan, one\nof Saturn\u2019s moons and the only place in the solar system other than Earth that harbours lakes.\nInstead of water, Titan\u2019s lakes are filled with\nmethane, a molecule made of one carbon atom\nand four hydrogen ones. The temperature on\nTitan is around -180 \u00b0C, which is just right for\nmethane to exist in three different states: solid,\nliquid and gas. The lakes on Titan form part of\na whole weather system, that works in much\nthe same way as the water cycle does on Earth.\nVast clouds that cover the surface for most of\nthe year (one Titan year, that is, which is equivalent to 30 Earth years) made up of evaporated\nmethane from the surface, that eventually precipitates back down to fill the lakes again.\nObservations made by the Cassini spacecraft currently in orbit around Saturn show\nthat lakes are not scattered across the surface\nof Titan uniformly, but instead tend to cluster\naround the polar regions. Clouds also appear to\ncluster near the poles at middle and high latitudes in the summer hemisphere, which until\nrecently was the southern hemisphere.\nDr Mueller-Wodarg, a planetary scientist in\nthe Physics department at Imperial explained,\n\u201cRecent Cassini observations have made a direct link between changes in clouds and changes on the ground in terms of the sizes of lakes,\nhinting at actual weather events occurring right\nnow.\u201d\nPrevious models have tried and failed to explain all of these observations, but now a group\nof Caltech researchers think they can do just\nthat using a new model that is a cut above other\nattempts. For starters, it is 3D rather than 2D,\nand includes more detail about the transport of\nmethane from the surface to the atmosphere,\nand vice versa. It also takes into account surface reservoirs of methane and how they\nchange over a year.\nThe Caltech team, led by Professor Tapio\nSchneider, produced simulations that reproduced the distribution of clouds that has been\nobserved by Cassini and the right distribution\nof lakes.\nMueller-Wodarg said that through the\nCaltech team\u2019s work \u201cwe have gained a first\nunderstanding of what controls these features.\u201d\nSchneider and his colleagues think that because there is less sunlight at the poles of the\nmoon, on average, it is easier for lakes of methane to accumulate there. In places where there\nis a lot of sunlight, its energy would cause the\nmethane to evaporate and prevent the formation of such lakes.\nThe Caltech team simulated the interaction\nbetween the surface methane and that in the\natmosphere in more detail than has been done\nbefore.\nIt\u2019s raining methane\nTitan as seen by Cassini in ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths\nUntreatable TB found in India\nIn an early contender for scariest science story\nof the year, scientists in India announced that\nthey have found a strain of tuberculosis (TB) that\nis completely resistant to all drugs normally used\nto treat the disease. Doctors in Mumbai are calling the strain TDR, which stands for totally drug\nresistant.\nTB is already one of the worlds worst killers,\nalong with HIV/AIDs and malaria. This is partly be-cause, to cure it completely, a patient must take a\nlong course of antibiotics that have some unpleasant side effects and have to be taken long after\nthe patient stars to feel better.\nIncomplete courses of antibiotics, amongst other problems, have already given rise to two strains\nof TB known as MDR and XDR, which stand for\nmulti-drug resistant and extensively drug resistant\nrespectively.\nThe new TDR strain is a worrying addition, especially once you consider that not all counties have\nthe resources available to diagnose this strain of\nthe disease, and that one person with active TB\ncan infect up to 15 others.\n\u201cThe wind system calculated by the model,\nwhich plays a crucial role in globally distributing methane, appears to be quite realistic. This\nis important since only a single wind observa-tion, from the Huygens probe, is available near\nthe surface, so we rely on models to calculate\nthem\u201d said Mueller-Wodarg.\nArmed with this new model, scientists working on Cassini will hopefully now be able to\nplan observations so that they can test the predictions made by it. Mueller-Wodarg added,\n\u201cWe will now be able to predict cloud occurrences and specifically look for the predicted\nclouds.\u201d\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10666\nEvery four or five years we go along to a ballot box, tick our preferred political party and\ndefer all other decisions to the group that gains\npower. Most people probably believe this is the\nbest way of running things. We may not even\nhave much to say about education, economics or\nwar, so how could we add to decision making?\nAnd why is this being mentioned in the science\npages?\nA group of researchers, based mainly at Princeton, recently published results in the journal\nScience that showed democratic consensus is\nenhanced by the participation of what they term\n\u201cuninformed individuals\u201d. This means that the\npresence of people with weak preferences dilute\nthe control of a strongly opinionated minority\nallowing a decision to be finalised that is representative of the whole group.\nWhether it is schooling fish, flocking birds or\nan anarchist organisation, decisions are regularly\ndecided without voting. It has been argued that\nwith people/birds/anarchists acting with their\nself-interests the process of deciding what pub to\ngo to/where to fly during migration/whether it is\nethical to eat meat, even when it\u2019s from a bin, (a\ndebate I have witnessed) can be easily corrupted by an individual or small faction which are\nparticularly vocal to the benefit of themselves,\nrather than to the rest of the group. The group\nof scientists from Princeton used models of the\nmovement of animals, with varying preferences\nof direction, and varying strengths in that pref-erence, and found that a strong minority could\ndominate over a numerical, but weaker, majori-ty. However, when individuals with no real preference of where to go were added into the mix\nthey instantly returned control to the majority.\nThey also found these results to be reproduced\nin real experiments with groups of strongly\nschooling species of fish.\nThis study shows that consensus decision\nmaking, where voting is not used, can work\nwhen there are people with no real preference\ntaking part. Who knew that science would prove\nanarchists have been getting it right all along.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1210280\nApathy leads to better group decisions\nLuke Sheldon\nNicotine patches don\u2019t help you\nin the long term\nUsing nicotine-replacement patches or chewing\nnicotine gum does not help keep you off cigarettes in the long term, scientists have said.\nWhile such therapies could be useful immediately after quitting smoking, and studies have\nshown that people using nicotine-replacement\ntherapies are twice as likely to remain off cigarettes six months after quitting, the difference\nafter a few years is greatly reduced.\nIn fact, over five years scientists periodically\nquestioned a group of people who had given up\nsmoking and found that those who used patches or gum were no less likely to have relapsed\nthan those who did not.\nThis result does not change the fact that nic-otine-replacement therapies help many people\nthrough the quitting process, but those people\nwho do use them should be careful not to become complacent once the initial period is over.\nKelly Oakes\nDoomsday clock moves to five\nminutes to midnight\nScientists in charge of the symbolic doomsday\nclock moved its hand one minute closer to mid-night, so that it now sits at 23:55 \u2013 where it\nwas in 2007. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists,\nwho control the clock, explained their decision\nby saying that a \u201cpath toward a world free of\nnuclear weapons is not at all clear, and leadership is failing.\u201d\nThey cited a collective failure to stop the\nspread of nuclear weapons, act on climate\nchange, or find safe and sustainable sources of\nenergy, as shown by the Fukushima disaster in\nMarch last year.\nFELIX\nFriday 13 january 2012\n12\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\n\n"

But on the 4-7, just when Great\nDane was getting confident the Eagles\nstruck back and scored 4 goals taking\nthe 8-7 lead with mighty shots from\nleft-back veteran Lucas Carlsten and\nright-back Max Flashback.\nThe Eagles were now in control and\nhad their fate in their own hands (lit-erally). The game proceeded with the\nEagles leading by 1 or 2 goals until\na yellow card to Lucas Carsten and a\npenalty offered Great Dane the equal-izer. Perfect set-up for Great Dane\nright? You might think. Not when the\ngoal-keeper is handball legend Stefan\nBauer! Stefan Bauer, also known as\nSnakey B., saved the penalty and the\nEagles maintained the lead. By half-time, line-player and club president\nKolja Ortmann (Papa Bear as he likes\nto call himself) and left-back Yannick\nSeis had secured a 12-10 lead for the\nEagles. \u201cHot jets of man-steam\u201d from\nthe Eagles!\nAs soon as the second half whistle\nechoed in cold Leyton hall, Great Dane\nbegan an aggressive defense policy. The\nEagles offered a couple of counter attacks but maintained the lead. This time\ngoals come from centre players Charles\nMagne and Kristof and a couple by the\nright wing signed Ruben Freytag. Left\nwing player and club captain Roberto\nGalli, elected more for his partying\nskills and outstanding physical beauty\nrather than handball talent, also scored\na couple of important goals.\nThe Eagles\u2019 Greek keeper Mega Alexandros, who is believed to descend\ndirectly from Alexander the Great\nhimself, saved some tough shots and\nhelped keeping the Eagles 2 or 3 goals\nup. At 5 minutes to the end of the game,\nwith a five goal lead (23-18) the Eagles\nwere about to make history and set a\nnew standard for English Handball\nSecond Division.\nDespite all this, just when you think\nyou can start heading for a warm shower and are already planning to grab\nsome cheap celebratory lager from\nTesco, that\u2019s when you get punished (or\nbiffl\u00e9 as you say in French)! Complete\nmadness and unmentionable handball\nfrom the Eagles allowed Great Dane\nto climb back to reach a final score of\n25-25. Sacrebleu! What a shame! All\nin all, a draw is a good result and the\nEagles proved capable of great handball\u2026 but this draw really does taste\nlike defeat!\nSCIENCE\nWild weather on\nSaturn moon\nPage 12\nMUSIC\nThe art of selling\nout\nPage 18\nNEWS\nFisher Hall faces\ndevelopment\nPage 5\nFASHION\nNo love for Ugg\nboots\nPage 23\nFILM\nMamma Mia to\nMargaret Thatcher\nPage 20\n\n"

Also,\nan impressive amount of piste skiing was done\nby frequent racer Michael Parkes and his crew\n\u2013 leaving no piste untouched!

A total of 137 attendees made this the biggest ski trip in recent memory by quite a long way.\nJust two weeks before we left for the Alps there\nwas no snow \u2013 none. The wait for snow was painful but after enough Snow Dances praising the\nGod of Pow (powder snow) we were blessed with\nan unprecedented amount. A mere two days before the trip our chosen French resort, Les Arcs\nwas reporting \u201cDumping Snow\u201d \u2013 the biggest and\nmost consistent snow fall in 10 years. It really was\nmagic.\nThe wait to board the ferry at Dover gave us a\nchance to catch up with the other London universities heading our way \u2013 Arts, Greenwich, Southbank, Ravensbourne and a couple from Westminster. Everyone was in high spirits, especially the\ncommittee, who had been planning for this event\nfor a long time (six months!).

    "content": "The rumoured closure of the Holland Club\nhas seen an immense response from the\nCollege community. From staff to postgraduate students, the actions of College with regards to its feasibility study\nhave been watched ever closely since\nrumours of a possible closure surfaced\nover last term. Could the severity of such\na campaign, employing a sizeable Facebook page, make a change to the study\nand potentially, the future of the Holland\nClub?\nThe College has clearly been paying attention to the opinions that have been\ngenerated by the Facebook group. On\nWednesday an announcement on the\nImperial College website called for feedback and input into the feasibility study,\nconsidering such areas as \u201cwhat additional catering and amenities would best\nserve the needs of staff and students\non the South Kensington campus\u201d and\n\u201chow the ethos of the Holland Club might\nbe maintained within any new facilities\u201d.\nThe resulting comments continue the\ngreat deal of worry from patrons of the\nbar as already expressed on the Facebook group.\nHow the College proceeds with the feasibility study will, of course, be affected\nby the sheer number of people who have\ntaken to the relative channels to express\ntheir opinions over the rumoured plans.\nHundreds of campaigners will doubtless\nbe studying the issue with keen inter-est, which College cannot simply ignore.\nAny conclusions from the study must be\nable to withstand the heaviest of scrutiny if they are to be accepted by the\ncommunity.\nThe Holland Club is not a stranger to\npotential closure, with Felix reporting in\nJune 1995 on its then-financial difficul-ties. Nearly seventeen years on, and under whole new circumstances many have\ntaken it upon themselves to fight for its\ncontinued existence, which is, at the\nvery least, a testament to its popularity\namongst staff and indeed students.\nAs the coming days bring more news of\nthe College\u2019s conclusions into the study,\nthe campaign is likely to grow ever larger.\nIndeed, some patrons have even been\nconsidering events such as a sit-in in order to express their feelings. Regardless\nof the outcome, there\u2019s no denying that\nthe supporters of the Holland Club are\nready and prepared to fight their case\nwhatever the case may be.\nFELIX\nAll it takes is a little\nDutch courage\nS\nince the government cut\nfunding for higher education and Undergraduate\nfees were forced up, much\nhas been speculated about\nthe corresponding rise in Postgraduate fees. Though technically the funding from the Government for Postgraduate fees was also cut, since it is\nlumped in with the total Undergraduate teaching grant it is hard to prise\nthem apart and the two may in fact be\ninseparable. Across the country, we\nbegan to hear of price rises for Masters courses. The UK average is currently a 24% increase and as a student\nI had heard nothing from the College,\nthe Union or Felix about any rises at\nImperial until a lecturer remarked that\nthey were going up to \u00a39000. I decided to investigate.\nThe Imperial website is a good\nplace to start, but the course fees in\nthe Postgraduate prospectus are still\nthose from 2011/12. You would think\nfrom this that the fees for this year\u2019s\nentry have yet to be decided, but this\nis far from the truth. The fees are in\nfact published on the Registry section\nof the website. Why they haven\u2019t been\nchanged in the prospectus is beyond\nme. Having a closer look reveals a\nvery strange system of increases. A lot\nof courses have not gone up at all, or\nhave just gone up with inflation. Medicine is a good example of this. There\nare a few increasing at the national\naverage such as Bioengineering and\nComputing at 25% and 22% respec-tively. Whether this is justified or not\nis still a point of contention. Another\nstrange side of the Registry figures is\nthat, next to the 2012/13, they list the\n\u20182011/12 figure\u2019; the problem is that\nthese figures are frequently wrong, as\nanyone can see by comparing the Registry page with the prospectus.\nThen comes the shocker: the suite\nof 19 Life Sciences Masters de-grees, which have had their costs\nincreased by 78.2% from \u00a35050 to\n\u00a39000. Why?! Yet again, since the\nUnion didn\u2019t know about this, and we\nhaven\u2019t seen anything from College,\nI\u2019m going to make some assumptions\nbased on how I understand the system.\nIf these are wrong then I welcome\nclarification. It is time that this was\nchallenged though, as I know from an\nacademic, whose name I won\u2019t men-tion, that these fee rises were known\nabout in September.\nImperial as a University sets a\n\u2018baseline\u2019 Masters cost which is the\nminimum anyone will have to pay.\nThe College baseline is (from what I\ncan work out on the Registry website)\n\u00a33825. From then on the Faculties\ncan decide to increase this by however much they want, as there is no\ngovernment cap on Masters fees. The\nDepartments and Course Directors apparently have no power over the price\nof their courses. The Faculty of Natural Sciences has therefore decided to\nincrease these fees. What are the possible reasons for this? Fee s can increase for four reasons: to dramatically increase the quality of the course,\nto cover some new costs, to replace\nlost funding from another source (as\nwith Undergraduate fees) or to provide bursaries. I cannot see how any\nof these reasons can be justified here.\nAn increase in the quality or costs of\nthe course would surely be something\nthe Course Directors have an influence over and so they subsequently\nwould advise that the fee would have\nto go up. But Course Directors were\ntold how much their fees would have\nto increase by the Faculty, which has\nno role in the quality or running costs\nof individual courses.\nThe drop in funding from another\nsource could correspong to the reduction in the government teaching grant.\nBut if this is being taken into account\nthen we should see an equal increase\nacross all Masters courses, which\nwe do not. Regarding bursaries for\npostgraduates, I have heard rumours\nbut nothing concrete. More bursaries\nwould be welcome, but surely if this\nis the reason for the increase then it\nstill doesn\u2019t explain why such a large\nincrease is happening in such a tar-Mystery over Masters fee\nrises\nAlexander Kendall\nMCap \u2013 Master of Captions. \u00a39000\ngeted way.\nWhat effect will this have? There\nis little support from the government\nand the University, who provide for\na select few very needy and intelligent students doing Masters. Most\nstudents have either saved up for the\ncourse and accommodation costs or\nhave the Professional Development\nLoan, a commercial loan provided by\neither Barclays or the Co-op for up to\n\u00a310,000. Though this is commercial,\nthe government pays the interest during your time of study, but you have\nto begin paying it back, whether you\nhave a job or not, within a month\nof finishing. Fair enough, you may\nsay. The problem arises because this\n\u00a310,000 maximum amount is not set\nto increase. Masters fee increases,\nwhen not combined with loan in-creases, simply price people out com-pletely. This is not just a case of more\ndebt but of a simple inability to pay.\nImperial has also now introduced a\ndeposit system for Masters \u2013 10% as\nsoon as you accept your place. Many\npeople cannot afford to pay \u00a3900 several months before getting any loan or\nfinancial assistance.\nThe financial reasons for this and\nthe potential solutions have yet to be\nthrashed out. What is unacceptable\nis Imperial\u2019s secrecy over these fee\nrises. It is bizarre that no one seems\nto know about this and it isn\u2019t being\ntalked about. Course costs should be\ntransparent. The Faculty of Natural\nSciences needs to explain why it has\nimposed a 78% rise on 19 Masters\nwhen costs for other Masters in the\nCollege have remained the same or\ngone up by only a few percent. Other\nFaculties should also explain any rises\nabove inflation. The College needs to\nexplain why some Masters are going\nup and some not, and whether or not\nit sees this as fair. That the fee rises\nwere decided by September and yet\nthe Postgraduate prospectus has, to\ndate, not been updated is unaccept-able.\nWant to\nshow this\narticle to a\nfriend but\ndon\u2019t want to\npay for the\npostage cost\nof the paper?\nYou stingy\nso-and-so.\nLuckily, you\ncan also\nread it, and\nall other\narticles,\nonline at\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nMasters fee\nincreases, when not\ncombined with loan\nincreases, simply\nprice people out\n\u201c\nMasters\nMasters\ni\ni\nFELIX\nFriday 13 january 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\n\n"

An all-too-brief respite from this grim reality was granted to\nthe dedicated few who chose to brave the\nannual pilgrimage to Edinburgh for the only\ndryslope snowsports event ever to achieve a\nreclassification to Class B.\n400 miles of tarmac and a severe reduction\nin life expectancy was all that stood between\nthese intrepid adventurers and glory. The\ndampest, blurriest, and most sleep deprived\nevent on the snowsports calendar, it is of\ncourse time once more for BUDS (British\nUniversity Dryslope Championship).\nDuring passage, nervous glances were\nexchanged amongst travellers as a cold\nsweat covered the collective brow of our\nfirm-handed helmsman and women, skilfully navigating the 15 seater land craft and\naccompanying five seater \u201cpussy wagon\u201d to\nthe infamous pub-toilet brown slopes of the\nMidlothian snowsports centre.\nTruly blessed were these men and women,\nas the usually cruel Scottish weather Gods\nhad gifted them a rain free weekend. The\nnext few days were to be lost in a sweaty\nhaze of dirty women, warm Buckfast, and\nfilthy dubstep.\nBroadly speaking, BUDS goers can be divided into three camps; the diehard partici-pants, the nonchalant spectators, and the van\nwarriors \u2013 who are most likely to be found\ndraped across the front seats of the gentle\ndiesel giant, basking in the warm breath of\nits powerful electric heaters.\nThe first of these groups put in an impressive performance over the weekend, and despite the long wait to ski ratio (think 2 hours\nsat at the top of the hill for a 20 second de-scent) our ski race team did particularly well,\nwith Simon Federer finishing top out of the\nLondon unis for individual ski racing.\nOf course the real star of the show, the untamed beast that crawls out from Edinburgh\u2019s\ngrimy underbelly, only rears its head at night\n\u2013 the freestyle comp. Luckily, Imperial had\nits age-old father and son duo to \u201creprazent\u201d\nthis year, with Luke Bridgestock leading the\nway with a slow, controlled, and confident 3,\nwhich he nailed to the dendex.\nJohn \u201cScab-me-please\u201d McGukin followed like a faithful squire in his father\u2019s\nboard tracks, and landed a similarly dope 3,\nto an eruption of applause from the capacity crowd, and supersonic squeal of \u201cJohn\nboy!\u201d from our club captain-cum-mother,\nBeth Burks.\nThe standard of freestyle at BUDS has increased so dramatically in recent years that\non the final night we witnessed something\nhither to unseen at a student snowsports\ncompetition. The weathered audience was\nwhipped into a quasi-religious frenzy by\nthe man on the mike, resident MC Sketch,\nto chants of \u201cdouuuuble, douuuuble\u201d. Moments later the atmosphere exploded as a\nskier landed a double front flip. Hands were\nthrown towards the sky, strangers were\ncaught in impulsive embrace, as this shared\nmoment brought a tear to the eyes of even the\nmost soulless and battle hardened of snows-ports warriors. The beats were cranked, and\nthe audience pumped; a climatic end to an\nunforgettable event.\nIt\u2019s at some point between the fourth\n\u201cbreakfast fag\u201d, and finding yourself legs\nakimbo by the side of a Scottish cathedral,\nstinking of booze, that you are forced to reevaluate your life. We did just that at BUDS,\nand came across a startling realisation. We\nare where we want to be. So we lay this monstrous event to rest, quivering in moist anticipation for next year, and prepare ourselves\nfor the furious mental blizzard of the Winter\ntrip. We went big, now it\u2019s time to go home.\nSPORT\nFELIX\nFriday 13 january 2012\n30\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editors: Indy Leclercq\nDavid Wilson\nWeb: www3.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nFacebook: Search \u2018Sport Imperial\u2019\nTwitter: @SportImperial\n\n"

These honours are issued by the Monarch on the advice of\nthe Government for exemplary service.\nProfessor Sir Stephen Bloom, the head of the\nDiabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism division\nin the Department of Medicine; and Professor Sir\nSimon Donaldson, a researcher into geometry and\ntopology at the department of Mathematics, have\nboth been appointed Knight Bachelors. In addi-tion, Professor David Philips, a researcher at the\nDepartment of Chemistry, as well as President of\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry, has been made a\nCommander of the British Empire (CBE).\nAs well as the members of staff, five members\nof Imperial\u2019s alumni have been given honours,\nincluding a Knighthood and a Damehood (the female equivalent).\nThe Rector of Imperial College has extended his\ncongratulations to the staff and alumni. In a statement to Imperial\u2019s press office, he said \u201cThese\nresearchers, along with the Imperial alumni who\nhave been honoured, represent some of the very\nbest that the UK has to give. On behalf of the College, I offer them all my warmest congratulations.\nPhilip Kent\nNEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 13 january 2012\n4\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nRally to \u2018save Holland Club\u2019\nThe Facebook campaign has attracted over 600 members at the time of going to print\ntowards solving, as highlighted by an\ninterview with The Reporter (Septem-ber 27 2011) in which Mrs Neary stated:\n\u201c[Commercial Services] would like to\ncreate more space for the College community to interact socially, especially\ntaught postgraduates \u2026 [who] don\u2019t really have a place to call their own. We\nwould like to change that, providing a\ncatering and social space that could be\nopen out-of-hours and at weekends.\u201d\nIn her correspondence with Felix, Mrs\nNeary went on to explain that the purpose of the feasibility study is to evaluate the space currently occupied by the\nHolland Club and determine which facilities would be required to best suit\nthe needs of the College community;\nwhether the new facilities should be\nopen to everyone or just a select group\n(i.e. staff and postgraduates, both taught\nand research) and \u201cHow the ethos of the\nHolland Club might be maintained in\nany new facilities.\u201d\nKevin Young, the manager of the Holland Club, told Felix that his main complaint is the way he feels that College\nhas not only failed to consult him on\ntheir plans for improving postgraduate\nfacilities, but also what he believes to be\nconcerted efforts on behalf of members\nof the feasibility study staff to not share\ninformation about it with him.\nSpecific examples he included to\njustify his belief included finding senior members of Properties Management and Commercial Services looking\naround the inside of the bar at 7am on\na Wednesday morning in early November without express permission from\nMr Young, and original requests made\nby college for allowing access for architects and engineers stating that the work\ndone was for \u201cupdating the college records.\u201d\nMrs Neary stated that the reason the\nHolland Club committee hadn\u2019t been\nconsulted was because there had been\nnothing to consult on, and that now that\nthe plans are progressing they have been\nmeeting with the panel in charge of the\nfeasibility study.\nThe Holland Club itself is named\nafter Sir Thomas Holland, former Rector of Imperial College London. It is\ntechnically a private members club for\nnon-academic staff, while postgraduate\nstudents (both taught and research) are\nHolland Club, and that communal spaces and function rooms remain.\nImperial College Union responded\nto the ongoing issue with the following\nstatement: \u201cUntil the feasibility study\ncomes back it is impossible to comment\non what potential plans there are for the\nspace the Holland Club occupies.\n\u201cIt is important to note that the Holland Club was setup as, and still re-mains, a bar for non-academic staff of\nImperial College London.\n\u201cThe Union will always be welcoming to plans that seek to improve the\namount of social space available to our\nmembers. It can only be seen as a positive move that College are looking to\ninvest several million pounds in more\nstudent facilities.\n\u201cWe look forward to submitting our\nresponse to any plans that are put forward by College and Commercial Services.\u201d\nAs a worst-case scenario, Mr Young\nis willing to discuss the moving of the\nHolland Club to new premises. This is\nnot the first time in its 62-year existence\nthat it has been moved. Originally starting as a room in 15 Princes Gardens\n\u2013 a location Mr Young jokingly said\nhe wouldn\u2019t mind moving back to \u2013 it\nwas moved to the Huxley building, before being moved into its current site in\nthe basement of Sherfield 16 years ago,\nwhich up until that point had been home\nto Imperial\u2019s telephone exchange.\nWhile most Holland Club bar users\nFelix spoke to weren\u2019t averse to the\nHolland club undergoing a renovation,\nthere was a fear on how said renovation\nwould be done. This was best expressed\nby one punter questioned who feared\nthat the \u2018pub\u2019 character would be lost to\nthe \u2018Ikea catalogue\u2019interiors endemic to\nCommercial Services\u2019 most recent proj-ects, the Eastside bar and the Queen\u2019s\nTower Rooms.\nThe various outcomes of the feasibility study, which are due in the second\nquarter of 2012, will be reported in Felix as and when they become available.\nallowed in as guests. In practice the bar\nis heavily used by PhD students when\nthey don\u2019t want to drink with undergraduates in the union or the cast of\nMade in Chelsea in the South Kensington locals, which can be prohibitively\nexpensive.\nThe Holland Club itself is self-gov-erned and not for profit, any money\nmade from the running of the bar is\nre-invested into the bar. Mr Young also\nstressed that the Holland Club management was not blind to the increased\nneed of postgraduate students, especially as they now made up the majority of\nits customers. The Holland Club committee was already looking as far back\nas last October into plans to re-open\nthe kitchen bring in network points for\ninternet access and purchase a coffee\nmachine.\nAs it stands the coffee machine has\nbeen bought with a three-year service\ncontract, and will be installed within\nthe next few weeks, a point that particularly annoys Mr Young as it may\nnow potentially be ripped out by Easter. This uncertainty about the future\nhas affected the day-to-day running of\nthe club, and also on the ability of the\nclub to go about carrying out its own\nimprovements. Plans to start serving\nlight pub food have been shelved until\nthe Holland Club can be sure the required equipment and staff are worth\nthe investment.\nIt is hoped that a compromise could\nbe reached between the goals set out\nby the Feasibility study and the current\nHolland Club. The feasibility study itself does plan to invite input from students and staff \u2013 including members of\nthe Holland Club \u2013 on what facilities\nare desired and how the project should\nproceed. However Mr Young expressed\nregret that the Holland Club hadn\u2019t\nbeen included in the process from the\nvery start. The primary concerns that he\nwants addressed in the feasibility report\nare that the new facilities will also be\nself \u2013 governed in the same style as the\nImperial Horizons initiative to\nchallenge undergraduates\nJoin the debate\nand have your\nsay on this\nstory at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nImperial has unveiled a new pilot scheme for un-dergraduates, which aims to challenge students to\nconsider global issues through use of their scientific knowledge.\nThe new initiative, entitled Imperial Horizons, is\nbeing led by the materials physicist Professor Adrian Sutton.\nThe free programme consists of eight weekly two\nhour sessions on Monday evenings on the South\nKensington campus, with students attending lectures delivered by Imperial research stars as well\nas outside speakers from the worlds of science,\nmedia and policy, allowing for further interaction\nwith the world of research.\nProfessor Sutton has explained the purpose of\nthe scheme as a means to enable students to put\ntheir degrees in a broader context: \u201cUndergraduates at Imperial receive one of the most thorough\ntechnical educations available world-wide but there\nis a growing sense that the education we provide\nhas become too narrow, that we don\u2019t facilitate students from different faculties working together and\nlearning about each other\u2019s ways of thinking.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that Imperial College is exceptionally\nwell placed to deliver this programme. This is partly\nbecause the College has a long tradition of innovation in teaching and of recognizing excellence in\nteaching.\u201d\nThe course begins on January 23.

After losing the first game\ndD wanted this one bad and came out\nwith a fluid and organised offense. It\nwas enough to claim an 8-6 win over\nthe Champions of the Midlands region.\nThe final pool game saw dD face Blaze\nfrom Sterling University.

When\nHaze finally woke up from their reverie,\nit was all a bit too late for a comeback\ngiving dD a 6-3 win. This result put Imperial in the Top 8. The next match was\na quarter finals game against the very\nphysical team of Blaze from Dundee.\ndD had ups and downs in a very tight\ncontest that saw Blaze come out on top\nthrough clinical and organised play to\nclinch a 6-8 victory.

Named Chi_b\n(3P), the particle was recorded by ATLAS, one of four detectors within the\nLHC, and is a more excited state of the\nChi particle.\nChi particles are part of a family of\nmesons called quarkonia, whose constituents include a quark and their own\nantiquark. The Chi_b (3P) particle is an\nexample of bottomonium, made up of a\nbottom (or beauty) quark and a bottom\nantiquark.\nThe particle was discovered by researchers from the University of Birmingham and Lancaster University,\nwho analysed data from the ATLAS\ndetector and published their findings on\n22 December. James Walder, a research\nassociate from Lancaster who worked\non the analysis, said that the particle\n\u201cwas predicted by many theorists but\nwas not observed at previous experiments.\u201d\nProfessor Roger Jones, Head of the\nLancaster ATLAS group, said \u201cwhile\npeople are rightly interested in the\nHiggs boson, which we believe gives\nparticles their mass and may have started to reveal itself, a lot of the mass of\neveryday objects comes from the strong\ninteraction we are investigating using\nthe Chi_b (3P).\u201d\n\u201cThe better we understand the strong\nforce, the more we understand a large\npart of the data that we see, which is\nquite often the background to the more\nexciting things we are looking for, like\nthe Higgs\u201d, he added.\nProfessor Paul Newman, from the\nUniversity of Birmingham said that the\ndiscovery of this particle is a \u201ctestament\nto the very successful running of the\ncollider in 2011 and to the superb understanding of our detector which has\nbeen achieved by the ATLAS collaboration already.\u201d\nOther, less excited states of Chi particles were observed 25 years ago, and\nnew measurements continue to test theoretical calculations of the forces that\nact on fundamental particles. Dr Miriam Watson commented that this will\nLHC finds its first new particle\n\u201cmove us a step closer to understanding\nhow the universe is held together.\u201d\nDr Jad Marrouche, an Imperial researcher working on the Compact Muon\nSolenoid (CMS) experiment, another\ndetector at the LHC, told Felix: \u201cthis is\nyet another validation of the predictive\npower of our theories. However, it\u2019s not\nthe discovery we were all hoping for in\n2011 \u2013 there is still one more particle\nthe Standard Model predicts which we\nhaven\u2019t conclusively discovered yet,\nYes, you read right: time cloak. But\nwhat is this mysterious device? Well, it\nworks to conceal an event in time. This\nis not just science fiction; experiments\nand investigations have been carried\nout to show that such a cloak might actually be a possibility.\nNow before you get too many wild\nideas, let me preface this article by\nsaying that there is no garment that\nallows you to escape from even the\nworst lectures.\nImagine a spatial cloak which renders what is inside invisible. Most\nideas concerning this use the refraction\nof light and bend light around a spatial region using lenses with negative\nrefractive indices, to make it appear\nundetectable.\nInstead of diffracting and refracting\nlight, the time lenses affect its disper-sion. For an event to be detected in\ntime or space, you need to change,\nmanipulate or somehow alter a parcel\nof light. When we view an object on\nthe table, what we are seeing is all the\nlight reflected off its surface. Just as a\nspatial cloak warps light around space,\nthe time lens will similarly affect light\nand not allow it to reflect of the region.\nTo achieve this, Moti Fridman and\nhis research team at Cornell University accelerated the front of the incident\nlight and delayed its rear part.\nA split time lens creates a \u201cfrequency\nchirp\u201d which is interpreted as separating the red and blue parts of the spectral wave and delaying them. A sin-gle-mode fibre further delays higher\nwavelengths while speeding up shorter\nwavelengths with respect to the initial\nbeam. There comes a point where the\nregion is fully isolated. The process is\nthen reversed so that the regular wave\nis detected and it is unnoticeable that\nthe wave has been changed at all.\nThe best visualisation I can give\nis to imagine a sheet of light coming\ntowards the zone, which has different\nwavelengths being sped up and slowed\ndown so the light bends around the re-gion, analogously to an invisible spatial lensing effect.\nWhether or not you can imagine\nit \u2013 as with the case of most modern high level physics, even Richard\nFeynman said \u201cI think I can safely say\nthat nobody understands quantum mechanics\u201d \u2013 Fridman\u2019s team was able\nto experiment using the method and\nHave you seen my time cloak?\nPavitar Devgon\nAlexander Karapetian\nbut 2012 will hopefully be that year.\u201d\nThe LHC continues to fill gaps in\nthe Standard Model of particle physics and leads the search for the Higgs\nBoson. It was closed for the Christmas\nholidays and will resume running following a submission of various papers\nthis month regarding the latest Higgs\nanalysis data showcased at their scientific update and press conference on\nDecember 13.\narXiv:1112.5154v1\nshowed that the lens actually can mask\nan event to a high degree.\nThe experiment was set up so a\n1569nm light pulse interacted with a\nnon-linear fibre, producing a 1539nm\nsignal. The 1539nm signal was clearly\nobserved when the cloak was turned\noff, however once activated, the cloak\nreduced the amplitude to noise levels.\nWhile the time cloak is not 100%\nefficient, it did conceal the majority\nof the fibre, reducing the amplitude\nby more than 10 times. To greater increase efficiency, the \u2018temporal gap\u2019\ncan be widened by exaggerating the\ndispersion of light between the split\ntime lenses. There is a trade-off here\nthough as the effects of third-order\ndispersion arise and interferes with the\nexperiment, reducing efficiency.\nWhile these experiments do provide\nstrong evidence that we should continue research into this field, they are\njust the beginning and it will still be a\nlong time before you can weave your\nown time cloak from tachyon hairs and\nuse it to escape from bad lectures. In\nthe mean time, we will just have to risk\nbeing seen.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10695\nLeap second\nannounced\nPhilip Kent\nAstronomers and engineers at the International Earth Rotation and Reference\nSystems Service (IERS) Earth Orientation Centre recently announced that a\nleap second will be applied at the end\nof June this year. Leap seconds are introduced by the IERS to make up for\ninaccuracies in timekeeping, made\nas a result of the slowdown of the\nEarth\u2019s rotation. This additional second means that June 30 will last until\n23:59:60UTC, instead of ending at the\nend of the 59th second. As this is during\nBritish Summer Time, the change will\nbe applied at 1AM, and will be marked\nby a 7th \u2018pip\u2019 from the BBC\u2019s time sig-nal.\nCoordinated Universal Time, or UTC,\nis the measure of time from which all\ntime zones are offsets of, and is derived\nfrom an international network of atomic\nclocks. While this leads to an incredibly\naccurate measurement of time, it fails to\naccount for the decrease in the speed of\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation. This decrease is as\na result of the circulation of currents in\nthe atmosphere and oceans, as well as\ndue to lunar pull.\nUT1, an alternative measure of universal time, is instead based on the\nrotation of the Earth against the Sun,\nmaking it a more accurate form of\nGMT. This does take into account the\nslowdown, though having days of non-constant length is inconvenient so UT1\nis not in general use. As the slowdown\nis accounted for, UT1 is more accurate\nthan UTC, and so there is a difference\nbetween this \u2018accurate\u2019 measurement\nand UTC\u2019s \u2018convenient\u2019 one.\nThis difference can become prob-lematic, so the IERS have the option of\nintroducing leap seconds at the end of\nJune and December. These seconds are\napplied so that the difference between\nUT1 and UTC never exceeds 0.9 sec-onds. To date, there have been 25 leap\nseconds applied to UTC, the most recent being at the very end of 2008.\nThe future of the leap second is un-certain, with a proposal by the UN International Telecommunication Union\nto abolish them. If there is approval by\nmembers of the ITU in a conference later this year, then no more leap seconds\nwould be applied from 2017.\nWhilst this is unlikely to be an issue\nfor most \u2013 watches, for example, are\nunlikely to be accurate to the second\n\u2013 systems that update their time automatically (such as via the Rugby Time\nSignal or NTP) will be automatically\ncorrected.\nStill the best way to escape from truly awful lectures\nThe ATLAS detector where the new particle (not pictured) was found\nWant to write for Felix\nScience?

Diagnosed as mentally incompetent as a child, Salander\nis a Ward of the State who has, in her\nshort life, been subjected to all manners\nof physical and mental abuse. Mikael\nBlomkvist is hired by Henrik Vanger\n(Plummer), former CEO of a large cor-poration, to solve the four decade long\nmystery of the death of his niece. Reluctant at first, Blomkvist finally accepts\nthe job and moves out to the small town\nof Hedestad, where he is later on joined\nin his investigation by Lisbeth. What\nfollows is a truly harrowing tale of murder and deceit.\nDavid Fincher, well known for his\npsychological thrillers dealing with\nmass-murderers (Se7en, Zodiac), is really in his element with this film. FolMara and her much more complicated\ncharacter. Also, despite his reasoning\nof Blomkvist not necessarily having\na Swedish accent because he\u2019d lived\nabroad, sounds like laziness and makes\nhim the only cast member without an ac-cent.\nIn terms of book-to-movie adaptation,\nthe American version is almost perfect,\nwith only a few changes that don\u2019t take\nanything away from the viewing pleasure of people who have read the books.\nThe book itself was difficult because of\nthe subject matter and I\u2019m glad the Hollywood version didn\u2019t gloss over the\nmore extreme scenes. People who are\nfamiliar with Fincher\u2019s work won\u2019t be\nshocked by how graphic and violent this\nmovie is. This is not an easy movie, but\nI found it highly enjoyable and have already seen it twice. It\u2019s not necessary to\nhave read the books before watching it,\nbut I would recommend reading them to\ngain a fuller appreciation of the characters and story that Stieg Larsson created.\nMany critics have said that they do\nnot understand why it was necessary to\nmake a Hollywood version, but great\nstories can be told again and again, and\nLisbeth\u2019s story is a great one. This truly\nis a stunning, thought-provoking film\nand makes a nice change from the usual,\nna\u00efve Hollywood flicks.\nAs Rooney dons her new tattoo...\nLet\u2019s take this to the bed shall we Agent Salacious Salander?\nlowing his Oscar nominated The Social\nNetwork from last year he manages to\nagain direct an amazing movie. The\nopening title sequence alone makes it\nclear that the next 2.5 hours are going\nto be equal parts uncomfortable and on-the-edge-of-your-seat exciting to watch.\nFilmed on location in Sweden, this adaptation is fast-paced and gripping from\nstart to finish.\nMuch like Natalie Portman\u2019s performance in Black Swan, Mara\u2019s portrayal\nof goth hacker Lisbeth is a fine example\nof total character embodiment. This little\nknown actress, probably best known as\nthe girl who dumps Mark Zuckerberg\nin The Social Network is the perfect\nfit physically, but has also turned out\nbe perfect in her acting.

The\nreplacement as female lead (Rapace) is\nso completely undeveloped and utterly\nbland that I can\u2019t even remember her\ncharacter\u2019s name.\nThis is certainly not a disaster, all the\ngood points I made still apply. If you go\nand see this film you\u2019ll probably enjoy\nyourselves \u2013 just don\u2019t expect too much.\nI must say that my feelings about Guy\nRitchie\u2019s latest Sherlock Holmes are\nsomewhat mixed. When I first walked out\nof the cinema after seeing the film shortly\nafter Christmas, there was no doubt that I\nfelt I had gotten my money\u2019s worth. Sure,\nit wasn\u2019t exactly faithful to the original\nstories or even, with its heavy action fo-cus, to the stories\u2019 spirit. However, I always find it pointless to demand absolute\nverisimilitude with the source material of\nan adaptation. There is no reason a different interpretation, if well made, couldn\u2019t\nbe just as good as the original.\nMind you, Sherlock Holmes: A Game\nof Shadows is certainly well made. The\naction is fast paced and exciting and, as\nin the last film, slow motion is generally employed to great effect - though I\nwill admit that some might find it rather\noverused at times. Despite the changes\nin tone, the crucial elements that have\nof domestic politics. All these, however,\nare easily forgotten and, if it wasn\u2019t for an\nunlucky coincidence, I might have said\nthat this is as good a Holmes film as we\ncould have hoped for.\nYou shouldn\u2019t expect an intellectual\nmasterpiece from a Sherlock Holmes\nmovie but I would at least hope for some\nsort of insight into our protagonists and\ninteresting characterisation. Unfortunately the explosions and witty banter\nleave very little room for either. Indeed\neverybody outside of the main pair seems\nsuperfluous to requirements. After hav-always made Holmes stories so compelling \u2013 the character of Holmes and his\nrelationship with Watson \u2013 are still pretty\nmuch intact. While this relationship between our protagonists is far more fractious than in Conan Doyle\u2019s work, their\nmany arguments provide some of the best\nscenes in the film and do not obscure how\nstrong their friendship really is.\nThe film certainly isn\u2019t perfect. There\nare numerous small plot holes and, while\nI\u2019m no expert myself, the movie\u2019s understanding of foreign affairs seems almost\nas bad as its predecessor\u2019s understanding\nElementary my dear Watson, you should never start with French\nbecomes fully apparent in the future\nnovels, Mara still manages to beautifully\ncapture both Lisbeth\u2019s rough exterior\nand her vulnerability. Her dedication to\nthis role is demonstrated in her willingness to cut and dye her hair, and by suffering through a number of piercings. It\nwould be easy to turn Lisbeth into a ste-reotype, but she keeps surprising viewers at every turn and I\u2019m excited to see\nwhat Mara has up her sleeve for the next\ntwo films.\nThe casting of Craig as Mikael Blomkvist was also initially a surprise, but he\ndoes a fine job of breathing life into the\ncharacter. He\u2019s a far-cry from the suave\nJames Bond, but then it\u2019s not right to try\nand compare those two characters.

It\u2019s the equivalent of going into your favourite restaurant, which serves\nsome luxury food you love, eating there and\nmaking a run for it without paying. Then the\nnext time you go, the owner knows what you\nintend to do, but for some reason he still gives\nyou some food, because cooking is what he\nloves to do (I know, not quite the same, but you\nget the point), which may not be as nice; and\nyou still don\u2019t pay. Then you go home and have\na fit about it to your friends.\nBeing in a band for over 5 years now, and\npursuing the dream of being signed by some\nindie record label that also has bands that we\nlistened to daily - such as This Will Destroy\nYou or Moving Mountains (no, not the song\nby Usher) - has made me realise how tough it\nreally is.\nThe dream started to deteriorate as we realised\nhow many obstacles stand in the way of under-P\neople, including me, seem to nag\nabout how bands are continuously\nfollowing the crowd and moving more towards the mainstream\ngenres, instead of keeping it underground and just making music like they used\nto \u2013 a term known as \u201cselling out\u201d. But in our\nincreasingly greedy, torrent-driven society,\nwith its ever expanding pool of artists, is it any\nwonder that bands are almost forced to move in\nthis direction?\nHow are artists expected to keep making\nunderground music when the demographic\nfor this sort of appeal is so small, and the few\npeople that do listen to it don\u2019t seem to want to\nspend any money on actually supporting them?\nIs it selfish for a band to take the initiative\nto move in a direction where they can actually\nmake enough money to live on, instead of living on a tour bus, making only enough money\nto eat fast food and pay for fuel? Don\u2019t you\nthink they would prefer sticking to the music\nthey love to play, if they could afford it?\nI mean, here we are, possibly leaving our\nchildhood dreams behind and modeling our\nlives around getting enough money to actually\nsupport a family one day or buying a Porsche\n911. Is it really any wonder that some of these\nartists actually want the same thing? And that\nthey may have to sacrifice a little bit of their\ntaste by actually \u201cselling out\u201d a little to make a\nbit of extra cash?\nIs it really our position to judge whether a\nband has done the wrong thing, as we sit back\nand do the same in our lives with our career\npaths? I know people, including many friends,\nwho complain endlessly about this and then go\nonto their computers, with their libraries of hundreds of gigabytes of music (most of which exist just to add to the collection and rot), stacked\nup nicely into lines of folders. All of which was\ndownloaded illegally!\nI\u2019m sorry, but if you are going to do that, then\nDo they owe us a living?\nTheo Pavlakou on selling out to bring home the bacon\nEver heard of ScarletSnowPrelude? \u2013 No! Because they didn\u2019t sell out... or they suck?\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nOneohtrix Point\nNever\nReplica\nSoftware\n2011\nMy New Year\u2019s Resolution was to stop using\nfood metaphors in my writing, but as you will\nsee, this album has left me a bit drunk and I\u2019ve\nsuccumbed to the lurid appeal of Pot Noodle\nonce again.\nBroken resolutions aside, 2012 is still young\nand the green shoots of new albums are yet to\nappear. So I hope you will forgive me if albums\nfrom 2011 continue to appear for a week or two.\nIndeed, Oneohtrix Point Never\u2019s Replica is a release from November that certainly carries its\nweight into the New Year.\nReplica is a 40-minute cacophony of a gazillion\ndifferent and competing sounds from Brooklynbased experimentalist Daniel Lopatin. Lyrics\nfear to tread in his ambient netherworld where\npianos dash in and clash horns with chopped up\nsqueaks and run-down, exhausted beats.\nI\u2019ll be straightforward: it\u2019s not something that\nyou would expect to like. It\u2019s deeply weird. At\ntimes there\u2019s an almost-overwhelming urge to\ngrab your speakers and shout, \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t\nbe working!\u201d\nBut work it does. Despite the tongue-twisting\ndiversity of flavours, this dish is a spectacularly\nenjoyable shock to the senses. When things get\ntoo hot, soft sea-like melodies soothe like a\ncool glass of milk. If it feels like things are getting a bit meek, Replica chucks a raft of chillies\ndown your throat.\nThe overall effect is rather otherworldly. It\nfeels oddly appropriate for the New Year: it\u2019s\nvery suggestive. The great variety of sounds\nrubbing shoulders on crowded tracks, or warily\nstanding off from each other, leaving large Jamie xx-shaped gulfs between them, feel like a\ncipher of what\u2019s to come in 2012. Like a mashup of ghostly tunes that are yet to be recorded.\nSo perhaps not the easiest album to start\noff the term with. I might have selected The\nWeeknd\u2019s latest superficial mixtape, Echoes of\nSilence, except that I think it\u2019s a cheap, one-dimensional knock off of Michael Jackson\u2019s\nDangerous (screw it, of MJ generally) and not\nworth anyone\u2019s time. But given its fair chance,\nReplica will prove as satisfying as those 4am\nPot Noodles, and without any of the shame...\nIf you\u2019re upset at my gratuitous trolling of The\nWeeknd, tweet me @kadhimshubber to tell me\nwhy I totally don\u2019t get it, and it\u2019s like \u201call sexy and\ncreepy and shit\u201d.

I urge you to try\nyour hardest to use your laptop for something\nother than a wanking aid and check out some of\nAt The Drive-In\u2019s music or at least the Recommendation below.\nRemember to come back every week and if\nyou\u2019ve got exams coming up just remember\nwe\u2019re all dead at the end of the year anyway\nso fuck it. Good old Mayans, always making\neverything better.

These things cannot be put into\nwords and so to see them in action I suggest\nfollowing the Recommendation at the end.\nTheir notoriety caused them to lead the 90s\npost-hardcore movement to fight the generic\nmusic heard every day on radios worldwide.\nThey used the sheer power of their music to\nstart winning this war but like the true drug-addled lunatics that they were, they committed\nan act of friendly fire in one of their final shows\nwhen front man Cedric Bixler-Zavala criticised\nfans of the band for \u201cslam-dancing\u201d and continued to bleat like a sheep at them.

You go to press the big\nred shiny button when you realise that\nyou\u2019re now black. Fuck this. You go play\nbasketball with Shaq instead. You lose.\nTaurus\nThis week you need a piss. You urinate\nbehind some deserted bushes and then\nrealise there are Taliban corpses hiding within the bushes. Fuck. You try to\nrun when a hundred miltary spot lights\nhit you at once. The only thing you can\nthink of is that your fly is undone.\nGemini\nThis week you remember its now 2012\nand therefore the end of the world. You\nform a bucket list. The only two things\non it are to get your degree and get\nlaid. You realise that you still have another two years to your degree and you\nhaven\u2019t been on a date in months. Nice.\nCancer\nThis week your friend keeps telling\nyou about how amazing Skyrim is,\neven while you sleep. You don\u2019t even\nlive with the guy. You can only take\nso many stories about throwing bears\noff mountains and shatter his CD. You\nbathe in the sweet, sweet Level 32 tears.\nLeo\nThis week you take a keen interest in\nAmerican politics. After a quick trawl\nthrough the internet you realise that you\ndon\u2019t particularly want to live on this\nplanet anymore. You watch a couple of\nminutes of FOX News before breaking\ndown completely and supporting a ban\non masturbation.\nVirgo\nThis week you go and see Tom Cruise\u2019s\nlatest generic action film .Inspired by\nthe fact that he hasn\u2019t aged over the\npast 20 years, you become a Scientologist to discover the key to eternal youth.\nYou give them all your money and end\nup starving to death yourself. Oh, the\nirony.\nLibra\nThis week you decide to go on the show\nTake Me Out. You play the theme track\nto Doctor Who as you descend the ele-vator, dressed as Frodo.

You decide to hang\nout with some undergrads. One says:\n\u201cAllow Imperial, manz dun knoe about\nme.

Brilliant. You\u2019re sexy and\ncan fight crime and shit. Instead you find\nyourself shitting in a sandbox and licking\nyour own butt-hole all day. This wasn\u2019t\nwhat you were expecting. But you enjoy\nit. Meow.\nAquarius\nThis week you have exams. You grow\na revision beard. You realise you like\nyour revision beard. You decide to keep\nit.

You fail.\nPisces\nThis week you have to ask the question:\nWhatever happened to Will Smith? Seriously, the guy hasn\u2019t done a film for\nyears. What\u2019s that?

Using bugs planted in staff rooms and offices, alongside\nold-looking PhD students posing as\nstaff, the lid has been blown on what\nlooks like institutionalised abuse of undergraduates across all departments.\nDelays in publishing problem sheet\nsolutions are officially cited to be so that\nstudents attempt them without relying\non the answers, but a conversation overheard between senior staff in the Department of Physics has revealed that they\njust enjoy seeing them spend five hours\non a single question, knowing the obsessive nature of the average Imperialite.\nOne particular lecturer has also been reported to make his exams excruciatingly\nhard: in previous years people have\ncried after completing them, or not at\nall \u2013some just sit there for two hours because it would be a total waste of paper.\nSome complete it for this very reason.\nWhen the solutions are finally re-leased, some lecturers have replaced\nsome of the answers with more ques-tions, making doing a problem sheet\nthe turnip\nReporter\u2019s eyebrows raised, but not as high as they could be\nDRUNKEN MATE\nOF THE WEEK\nHe feels homesick... for his Mum\u2019s uterus.

So\nwhat is so fantastic about England? The\nweather is better on the continent, the\nskiing is better on the continent, and the\nbeaches are far, far better on the conti-nent. Europe is home to apr\u00e8s-ski, topless sunbathing and absinthe; we\u2019ve got\nbinge drinking and rain.\nTo compound this, we have chosen\nto spend three years (and upwards) of\nour lives here. Could there be more of\nan antithesis to the lazy hedonism of\nEurope than Imperial College? I find it\nunlikely. And so to my point \u2013 there is\nhope. Whilst you have resigned yourself\nto a slow and steady slog to a good de-gree, to turning your back on your inner\nlibertine, there is hope; hope in the form\nof the Erasmus scheme which will pay\nyou to spend a year of your degree in\nEurope.

Last year\u2019s International\nfood night was so debauched it is said\nto have made the head chef at Nobu fall\non his sword. There will be food and\ndrink from all over Europe, along with\nthe riotously attractive men and women\ncurrently on exchange, all of whom find\nthe British accent(s) wildly arousing.

At\nleast, that\u2019s what we\u2019re told, on an\nalmost weekly basis. Whether because of further decline in church at-tendance, or supposedly outdated and\nirrelevant teaching, Christianity is a\nfaith that seems to matter less and less\nin 21st Century Britain. Despite 70%\nof the population in the last census\nclaiming to be Christians, a survey\nin 2005 showed that only 6.7% of the\ncountry goes to church regularly. \u201cWe\nare a Christian country and we should\nnot be afraid to say so\u201d said David\nCameron in December. However, in a\n2008 poll, only 17% of people agreed\nwith him.\nThe picture is even more striking\nwhen it comes to the young. According to the Church of England\u2019s own\nresearch in 2010, the average age\nof a churchgoer was 61 and 59% of\nchurches had no members between 15\nand 19 years old.\nBut in universities across London\nhundreds of Christian students are\ntelling another story. Almost every\nuniversity, including Imperial, in the\ncapital has a Christian Union or CU\n\u2013 a group of Christians who try to\ngive every student on their campus a\nchance to hear the message of Jesus.\nAnd these CUs are coming together\nthis month to put on a week of events\ntackling life\u2019s big issues and the relevance of the Christian faith to them.\nSo what are these \u2018big issues\u2019? In\na unique London-wide survey, each\nCU spent a week in December trying\nto find out what their fellow students\nthought. They asked two simple ques-tions: \u2018What\u2019s your favourite film\u2019\n(not one of life\u2019s big questions, but\nbear with me) and \u2018If you could ask\nGod one question, what would it be?\u2019\nAnd they got some interesting an-swers.\nStudents most want to ask God why\nhe allows suffering to exist, followed\nby \u2018What is the meaning/purpose of\nlife?\u2019 Perhaps showing a slightly morbid streak, \u2018Is there life after death?\u2019\nwas third in the list and the simple\n\u2018Do you exist?\u2019 was also a popular\nchoice. In amongst these comparatively straightforward enquiries were\nmore profound philosophical questions such as \u2018Do you have a beard?\u2019,\n\u2018Why is my hair falling out?\u2019 and\n\u2018What is your favourite film?\u2019 London\nstudents\u2019 favourite films were less es-oteric, with the epic Lord of the Rings\ntrilogy topping the poll.\nUsing these results, CUs in London\nare holding Uncover: The London CU\nProject from the 23-27th of January.\nDuring the day each CU will host\nlunchtime talks and other events such\nas debates or \u2018Grill a Christian\u2019 panel\ndiscussions on their campuses. On the\nevenings of the 24-26th there will be\na central event at All Souls Church,\nnear Oxford Circus, presenting the\nChristian faith with opportunities for\ndiscussion via three of the most popular films: The Lord of the Rings, The\nShawshank Redemption and Inception. Starting at 7pm, these events\nwill include a caf\u00e9 and chance to ask\nany questions.
