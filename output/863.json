    "content": "FeliX The winners\nCongratulations to all the winners and commiserations\nto the losers. This year has seen the biggest shock\nin ICU election history. In its second year of running,\nnew election has won the post for which the best\ncandidate for years had stood. Ben Turner was the\nbest Deputy President candidate for a long time and\nhis loss was probably the hardest to bear. I hope he\nstands in the re-election.\nAs for the other posts, there were few surprises\nexcept the huge -turnout at St Mary's. Without the\nMary's vote, Paul Shanley would have had a very\nclose run against Doug King. Ian Thomas' strong\nshowing at the ballot box was also a close run thing,\nwith most of his votes from Mary's. Chris Stapleton's result never seemed in doubt.\nThe question now arises; why did the students at\nSt Mary's vote in such a polarised way? Having\nspoken to the candidates, it seems that St Mary's largely voted for people who went to them outside the\nhustings and made an effort in the halls and union\nbuilding. I believe they were right to vote in the way\nthat they did, although it was sad to see Doug lose\nso heavily at Mary's after he had spent a large amount\nof time over at Mary's. This must show a strong moral\nfor next year's candidates; if you don't give a shit\nabout Mary's they won't give a shit about you. Long\nlive democracy!\nIt now falls upon me to slag off the winners. I remember what a bastard my predecessor was at this\nstage of the year and I refuse to predict their\ndownfalls. Good luck to them all, it's a hard job\nwhichever you're doing and you'll need all the luck\nyou can get. Thomas Wyatt is dead, RIP ConSoc.\nThe dirt\nThis year's elections must rank as the dirtiest for\nyears. The presidential election has been a farce. One\ncandidate has broken nearly every rule in the book.\nThat candidate is Athos Ritsperis. He has consistently\nflaunted every rule he could find. At times it has\nseemed as if he has searched for more to break.\nWithin fifteen minutes of papers coming down he had\nbroken the rule which states that no election\ncandidate may use gum-backed stickers. The\ninevitable happened. The so-called 'badges' which Mr\nRitsperis claimed were not for use as posters rapidly\nfound their way onto walls and doors in college.\nImpossible to remove without the use of some sort\nof solvent, these stickers should have been enough\nto have Athos disqualified outright.\nNot content with the shambles which he rapidly\ndisowned, Mr Ritsperis proceeded to push his luck\nwith the receipt for his stickers. A scrawled piece of\npaper was all there was to show for the supposed 288\nstickers produced. The amount? \u00a33.65. As print unit\nmanager I would like to make an order for a few\nthousand such stickers. The figure is so cheap I know\nthat the ICU print unit cannot beat it. The only way\nin which the stickers could have been produced for\nsuch a small charge, is a fiddle.\nAthos must have had to search pretty hard for\nanother rule to break after the stickers, but he\nmanaged. Not content with his maximum 3000\nhandouts he persuaded his chums in Hellenic Society\nto produce a newsletter promoting him. As usual, Mr\nRitsperis disclaimed all knowledge of the incident. This\nwas pretty bloody amazing since Athos rang me\nwithin minutes of my refusal to release the material\nbefore it was approved by the Returning Officer. How\ncouldn't he have known about the handout, when he\nrang to complain about the delay on its release? The\nanswer is simple he was, and is, a lying g it. On the same day, Athos started to use handouts\nas posters. Yes, he had finally found the only\nunbroken rule so far! Claiming that it was his\nsupporters, and not him, Athos was let off the hook.\nFor a candidate to be disqualified they must be caught\nin the act, it seems. With God seeing all but Mr\nRitsperis' blatant cheating the other candidates were\nalmost certainly disadvantaged by his behaviour\nThen the day of voting came. With the rule which\nstates that candidates shall not canvas around the\nballot box in mind , Mr Ritsperis stood at ballot boxes\npointing at the box next to his name saying 'put a1 there.' I know that candidates sometimes place\nhandouts near the box, but this behaviour is\ninexcusable. Not only does it assume that voters do\nnot have a mind of their own, it displays yet another\nattempt to rig the ballot.\nThen came the CCUs and their idiotic plans to help\ntheir candidate, Doug King. Doug's a pleasant enough\nblok e, and had the ability to win under his own steam.\nThe CCUs wanted to be sure of it. Not only did the\ndim-witted Broadsheet Editor print a Small Ad\npromoting Doug King (fair enough, apart from the rule\nthat says that candidates shall not make use of CCU\npublications for publicity), but City and Guilds hatched\na plan to print free T shirts with the slogan 'I'm voting\nfor Dougie.' The latter would have been fair game if\nthe cost had been included on Doug's publicity\nbudget. Fortunately, Doug managed to control the\nproduction of the T shirts, thus saving himself a lot\nof trouble.\nMr Shanley is not without blame. As a non-member\nof IC Union last year, he stood at UGMs and opposed\nthe election of other candidates to the post of UGM\nChair. This enabled him to take the vacant post this\nyear, as he became a student. There is no doubt that\nthis post gave Mr Shanley a huge amount of publicity\nas well as another union post under his belt.\nPrompted by Mr Ritsperis' wish to produce extra\nposters to replace those which had blown down, both\nMr King and Paul Shanley had extra ones printed. A careful twist in the rules allowed this to happen.\nCandidates who asked had more posters than the\naccepted maximum of 300. With a precedent like this\nset, next year's candidates should be allowed as many\nposters as they like. After all, how many have blown\ndown? There is no way that the returning officer can\nbe sure. With no need for any real receipts, they might\nas well have had no budget limit set. The Union might\nas well have said 'Do what you like, we're not\nbothered.' There is no doubt in my mind that the\nreason the elections have been such a farce this year,\nis the appalling way in which elections committee and\nFiona Nicholas have interpreted the election rules. I don't know why they bothered with the rules, nobody\nelse did. It should be added that the election rules are\nnow almost certain to be rewritten with much stricter\nguidelines in mind.\nThe real dirt\nThe worst behaviour has not been exhibited by a candidate but an ex-union president, who should\nknow better. Sydney Harbour-Bridge has interfered in\nsomething in which he no longer has any say.\nConcerned for the future of his union, this ex-president of 1987-88 decided to mount a campaign\nagainst one candidate and to attempt to draw another\nunder his wing. Promising votes galore through his\nwarden chum, and one-time proposer, Ken Young, Mr\nHarbour-Bridge offered to back Doug King's campaign\nagainst Paul Shanley. Seeing this election puppetry\nfor what it was, Doug declined the offer. Syd was\ndesperate.\nHaving suffered at the hands of the libel column in\nFELIX during his year as president, Mr Harbour-Bridge\nwas almost certain the author was Paul Shanley,\nHaving seen the 'damage' this column had done to\nthe union (well him anyway), Mr Harbour-Bridge was\ndetermined to stop Mr Shanley at all costs. Mr\nHarbour-Bridge had another motive for his dirty\ndealings which follow shortly; his undying admiration\nand adoration of Jen Hardy-Smith, the union\nadministrator. There is no doubt that little love is lost\nbetween Mr Shanley and Ms Hardy-Smith. Sydney\nsaw the election of Paul Shanley as a threat to the\nstatus quo imposed upon the union by Ms\nHardy-Smith.\nHe had to stop the nomination of Mr Shanley going\nahead if nothing else. He had a member of college\nstaff check the registry and finance records for any\noutstanding bills or faults in Mr Shanley's registering\nwith college. Could Mr Shanley be banned from\nstanding because he had faced a disciplinary board\nover one matter? Could his outstanding bill for the\nBeans Club prevent him from standing? One thing is\nfor sure, Mr Harbour-Bridge made a vindictive\ncampaign to stop Mr Shanley standing for ICU\nPresident and pulled every string he could to ensure\nsuccess, before he realised that there were no\ngrounds for preventing Mr Shanley from running. The\nquestion still stands. Who was the staff member who\nmade enquiries into Mr Shanley's records: a member\nof staff in the Union Office or Ken Young?\nIf a permanent member of union staff made the\nenquiries they have committed a serious offence.\nThey have attempted to influence the sabbatical\nelections which they have no right to interfere in. If\nKen Young is the perpetrator, his position as a warden\nmust be brought into question.\nWhoever made the enquiries, one thing is for sure,\nMr Harbour- Bridge's interference in these elections\nis unforgivable. Not only has he proceeded to tell\neverybody not to vote for Paul Shanley (with no\nalternative offered, it seems) he has used every\npossible opportunity to intervene in the elections. He\nplanted questions at the hustings and scrawled DON'T VOTE FOR PAUL SHANLEY on the sign-out sheets in\nLinstead Hall. A petty thought, maybe, but then\neverything Mr Harbour-Bridge has done during these\nelections has been petty. The multitude of perverse\nactions taken by Mr Harbour-Bridge have culminated\ninto a festering mess. Not only is Mr Shanley\nunimpressed, Mr King has little respect for Mr\nHarbour-Bridge now.\nJackie Scott? The ultimate puppet for Mr HarbourBridge. As the candidate who would give up her time\nbooked in the print unit to another candidate, Ms Scott\nfell for the game plan. Mr Harbour- Bridge had hoped\nSt Mary's President, Rhydian Hapgood, would stand\nat the last minute. Rhydian finally decided for the\nsensible option of keeping out of the whole mess in\nfavour of a more worthwhile career. Seeing that\nRhydian was not going to stand, Jackie withdrew, in\na fit of panic, realising that she could well have won.\nI'm sorry Syd, but in your own words, IT HAD TO\nBE SAID.\nFEiiX is published by the editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union\n3\nbb ii canons Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit.\n3\nrm ce Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB ITel. 01-589 5111 ext 35151-Editor: Dave Smedley.
