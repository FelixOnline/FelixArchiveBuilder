At10.30 a.m. some 400 post-graduate\nfresher s assembled in the Geographical Hall\nthat famous meeting place used each year\nfor the Freshers' address by the Rector, Sir\n\"Patrick Linstead, and the various Union Officials. Sir Patrick reminded them all the worldwide reputation of Imperial College and expressed the hope that all of them would contribute in some way or other to the College name. Afterwards various Union Officials including the President of I.C. and the\nConstituent College Presidents addressed the\nmeeting but your reporter seemed to notice\na curious lack of response which he hopes\nis not to be interpreted as meaning that\nthe post-graduates do not intend to make any\ncontribution to College life.\nThe response from the under-graduates was\nmore promising. The Rector addressed some\n600 under-graduates; he warned them of the\ndangers of not achieving a correct balance of\nwork and play but at the same time he congratulated them on securing entry to I.C. saying 'For each one of you who has secured\nentry to this College there are seven who\nfailed to secure entry; in other words there are\nbehind each one of you seven ghostly images.'\nIt is of interest to note here that the Warden\nof Beit Hall in his address to the Residents\non the occasion of their Coming-Up Dinner\nsaid, 'Behind each one of you who secured\nadmission to this hall there twenty not so\nghostly images who failed to secure adm is sion', he went on, 'this in total can be said\nto represent a veritable pinnacle of fru strat ion'.

    "content": "Dramatic\nSociety\nFELIX JAN MAYEN\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE TRAGIC ACCIDENT\nIN JAN MAYEN, IN WHICH FOUR MEMBERS\nOF THE UNION LOST THEIR LIVES.\nOn the 25th June 1961 five members of\nthe Universit/ of London Beerenberg Expedition, lost their lives in Jan Mayen. J.D. Booth, J.R. Fraser, CM. Smith and P. Smith\nwere members of the gla cio logical party from\nImperial College, working in conduction with\na team of Geoloigists from Birckbeck College. J. Cole was the other member of the\nExpedition lost in the accident.\n[ had no wish to write this account of the\naccident but many inaccurate accounts of this\ntragedy are circulating in the Union and it is\nonly right that a factual account should be\ngiven by a member of the expedition.\nMost of the inaccuracies are due to reports\nwhich appeared in the National Press before\nthe full facts were known. The Norwegian\nPress condemned the 12ft. fibreglass boat because it was not built of wood. The British\nPress took their lead from the Norwegians.\nThe boat was, however, designed and built\nfor the conditions in Jan Mayen. and is similar to boats used by the Falkland Islands\nDependencies Survey in Antarctica.\nThe dinghy had been used successfully\naround the Island in 1959. Furthermore, (he\nboat and its two outboard engines were critically tested before leaving this country. Al though one engine was sufficient to power\nthe boat two were fitted as a safety precaution\nso that if one failed the remaining engine\nwould keep the boat under way.\nThe accident occured when the gla cio log ical team from Imperial College were being\nferried from Middle Jan to the North Cape\nof the Island where they were to have been\nbased for the next part of their work. The\nsea was flat calm when the journey com-men ced, so calm that it was possible to take\nhand-held telephoto cine shots of the seabirds\non the cliffs.\nThe boat was hit by a sudden squall and\nwithin five minutes the sea was raised into\na ferment of conical waves. One of these waves\nswamped the two outboard motors so that neither was restarted. Orders were immediately\ngiven to use the oars. It was as these were\nbeing brought into use that a second wave\ncapsized the boat.\nAt the time of the accident the party was\nnot more than 200 yd s. from the shore since\nit was known that such winds can arise extremely rapidly in this area. These katabatic\nwinds are caused by cold air masses gathering momentum while falling from the crater\nrim of the extinct Beerenberg volcano\n7,000 ft. above and are very local (at the time\nof the accident the air was calm only five\nmiles away).\nIt was no more than twenty minutes from\nthe time of the accident to when Fitch, the\nleader of the Expedition and sole survivor\nfrom the boat. ree hi ned consciousness on the\nbeach. The wind had died down and the sea\nwas 'oily' calm again shortly after. Fitch then\nwalked to the Radio Station without foot-wear, across snowfield s and lava flows, a remarkable feat of courage and endurance.\nMay I finally say that expeditions would\nnot obtain the support of the College Exploration Board, the Royal Geographical\nSociety and another sponsoring bodies unless\nthey had full confidence in the expeditions'\nplans. Further confidence in this Expedition\nwas demonstrated after the accident by the\nadditional support we received to return to\nJan Mayen to complete the gla cio logical work that had been started.\nJ. W.S. With the beginning of the new acca demi c year, quite naturally all our College societies\nare mustering their forces, and making plans\nfor the future.\nAmongst these is the Dramatic Society\nwhich although on public view on only a limited number of occasions, is nevertheless active all the year round. Already, plans have\nbeen made, and auditions are in progress,\nfor the coming Christmas production, and\ntentative plans are being formed for Easter\nalso.\nThe Christmas production will almost certainly be \"Tiger at the Gates\" by Jean\nGiraudoux. and will be produced by Mike\nBarron (known to many as a former Editor of\nFelix).\nSo far this term, activity in the Society has\nbeen largely centered around the recruitment\nof fresher s, since it is imperative that each\nyear there is an intake of \"fresher\" blood to\nthe Society in order that it may remain alive\nand ambitious.\nFollowing up contacts made in Freshers'\nDay, the Society held a Freshers' Tea in the\nConcert Hall Ion Thursday evening. Here,\nafter some light refreshment, the seventy or\nso freshmen present were divided into two\ngroups, this e interested in acting, and those\nmore inclined towards back-stage work. The\nformer took in a play-reading session, and the\nlater session, and the later were introduced to\nour stage whilst most of it's equipment was\ndemonstrated to them.\nIt is hoped that many of these freshmen\n(and women), will now take an active interest in our Dramatic Society. It should not\nbe out of place to mention that if fresher s, or second and third year students, who were\nunable to attend the meeting, are nevertheless interested, they will always be welcomed\non Wednesday and Saturday afternoons when\nmost of the work on stage is done.\nOf course, the prime object of the Dramatic\nSociety should be to entertain and to move its\naudience. This can be difficult to accomplish,\nand may become impossible unless the College provides a worthwhile audience which,\nsad to say for a college of our size, it sometimes fails to do! It is also valuable if the\naudience then makes useful criticism of the\nproduction as a whole (via Felix perhaps), so\nthat our standard can continue to improve.\nTherefore to cocl u de,;l quote from tn is years's pamphlet to the fresher s, when the\nPresident said:\n\"The critical appreciation of the aud-ien ce, of the College, is as vital to the Society's well being as the enthusiasm of its\nactive members\".\n\"So I extend an invitation to those of you\nnot concerned with the day to day functioning of the Socity to come and see our pla vs. and to let us know what you think of them.\"\nC.H.

    "content": "by COLCUTT\nThe invasion has begun. The peace, order\nand comfort of the past few, retrospectively\nblissful, weeks have vanished in the chaos of\nthe new term. The quadrangle overflows,\nMooney's staff tear their hair, queues from\neverywhere, and Howard and Arthur long for\nthe last of the Freshers' Dinners. Even the\n\"Doms School\" has been unable to function,\ndue to the crush, and the few addicts are\nwandering hopelessly and helplessly, looking for\nsomewhere to mix their dom s. But the invasion has been carried out rather\nmore sedately than usual. The fresher s actually smile when they go into the Union Office\nto ask from whence cometh their Union\ncards, and they clap very politely at all the\ncorrect places at the various receptions. In\nfact, they seem to be a very decorous, orderly and mannerly shower altho get her. No\ndoubt the Freshers' Dinners will give an indication of their true colours.\nThinking of colours, one wonders if the\nflag d rapped elegantly around the dartboard\nis the personal standard of the President or\njust some more work of the boys. Thinking back to the fresher s, it was strange to see\nthe many hardened faces among the downy\nfresher s, all trying to obtain free fresher s lunches. When these hardened gentlemen first\ncame to the College years ago (where is an\ninteger between 2 and 7) there were no\nfresher' lunches, so no doubt they feel that\nthey have every right to take what ought to\nhave been theirs.\nWhich brings me to the subject of C. N.D. When one considers that their puerile little\nhandouts are just typical\u201eof the juvenile mentality and antics of the College C. N.D. group,\none can sy pathis e with the members of\nCouncil who became so heartily sick of these\nindividuals last year that they decided to try\nto shake some sense into the society by suspending its constitution. It seems their efforts\nwere in vain. Why is it that causes that are\nundoubtedly worthy of considerable thought\nand level-header action invariably come to\nrest in the hands of such small-minded in-divi dual s?I heard rumours last week that Jim Carter\n(ex-Union Secretary) and Bob Finch (ex-Chairman S. C.C.) Were having to sleep alternate nights as they only had one bed between them. Jim denied it, of course.\nJubilant cries were heard in the lounge last\nweek, emanating from our Editor who had\njust discovered a copy of \"What's On\" (is this\na record?). When it was pointed out to him\nthat it was the previous week's issue he was\nundaunted: \" / shall enjoy reading about oil\nthe things I should have gone to\", he said.\nIta he ac vita hom in um ad modicum app are t quid aute mse qua tur quid vep rae ces sarit pr or sus ignoramus. Or perhaps, he just reads it\nfor the strip club adverts.\nHave you noticed the young ladies of\nI. C.W. A. parading backwards and forwards\nand forwards and backwards across the quad?\nThere seems to be a definite relationship between the number of quad.-crossings (q) and\nthe man-appeal of the young ladies (cor! !)\nwhich may be writen as:\nSUCCESSFUL FRESHMEN S' EVENING? Advertise\nin FELIX\nMorphy Day\n1901\nMorphy Day is one of the oldest occasions\nat Imperial College and is still one of the\nmost important.

    "content": "FELIX II W SP1P1 B OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Editorial Catnment\nThe Editor is occasionally asked, usually\nby the people who can think of nothing better to say, what his editorial policy is. The\nanswer to this question depends on what is\nmeant by the word policy. Felix has no policy\nin the sense that the Daily Express has a pro-Empire policy or the Times a pro-Gov-ern ment policy, for we avoid consciously slanting news to bias our readers for or against\nany particular cause or body; we aim at pre-sent ing, if not in the same issue at least in\nconsecutive issues, both sides of the current\ncontroversy. This is in itself a superhuman\ntask. Any reporter or commentator is biased\nin some way, for even if he or she has no\ninterest in a dispute his or her views may be\nswayed by other things. For instance, a group\nof people, however worthy they may be of\npunishment, being treated roughly, high-handed d ly or slightly unfair by authority will\nalways invite sympathy, and they usually get\nit.\nWhen spokesmen for both sides are invited\nto state their cases there are still difficulties.\nThe two writers rarely submit articles of equal\nlength, and editorial interference is not\ntaken kindly. Giving both article equal prominence also poses problems, and a chance\ntypographical error can reduce the one to incoherence and leave the other convincingly\nlogical. Thus although neutrality is our aim\nit is always difficult to achieve.\n\"Felix is lively animal\" says the Blue Book,\nand indeed we do try to keep the Union\nawake, to prick its conscience and to point\nout its hypocrisies. But to strike a balance\nbetween being lively and giving unwarranted\npublicity to groups whose aims are not in the\nbest interest of the Union is again difficult.\nIn fact, the policy of having no policy in\nthis sense is in many ways the hardest of all\nto adhere to.\nThe Eidtor would like to thank James\nCarter, Finlay McPherson, John Jennings,\nDick Lewis, Jan Guy, Colcutt, Collin WinWith this, Felix aims at providing each\nfortnight a balanced mixture of news, com-ment, opinion, gossip and humour to please\nas many as possible of our readers. We have\nsaid a good deal about aims but little about\nachievements, for this is for you to judge.\nInevitably you will feel that in some issues\nthis balance has not been correct, and that\nthe paper has been too serious, too frivolous,\nlacking in news and so on. It is then up to\nyou to correct this by writing articles of\nthe type which you felt were lacking, for\nFelix is your paper, the forum for your\nviews and the showcase for your literary\ntalent. This paper will be in part what\nyou, our readers, are willing to make it. The\nstaff are not exceptionally brilliant writers\nor journalists, capable of turning out delightful articles issue after issue for your ad mir ation, the v are ordinary students 'who believe that this College will benefit from having\na newspaper and who are willing to put >\nna good deal of hard work to see that it does\nhave one.\nFinally, we do not print every article\nwhich we receive for a variety of reasons.\nWe rarely receive anything which is obscene,\nblast ph emo us or libelous, though occasionally it would be tactless or offensive to print\nsomething which does not fall directly into\none of these categories. Usually the reason is\nthat it would upset the balance of the paper,\nand acceptable material has to be held over\nto the next issue. Here again' it is difficult\nto anticipate everyone's reactions to any particular contribution.\nIn short then, we aim at providing a bal-an ced, neutral and lively paper, and although\nwe crave your indulgence for our deficiencies, we shall work extremely hard to achieve\nthat aim this year.\n1 9 6 1 / 6 2\nDAVE GILBERT\nPENNY HOWARD\nMICHELE CONFAUVREUX\nCHRIS PETRI\nDENIS RAMHARRY\nANDREW PAWLOWICZ\nVacancy\nTONY ALCOCK\nPETE YOUNG\nstone, John Sheard, Chris James.

I mean that this term has begun with\nthe entry of one thousand three hundred and\neighty potential bop'bone players into the College. But, 1 hear your cry, in how many idiots\nwill this potential be brought to fruition1 A rapid glance at the Rimshot Jazz Yearbook indicates that the answer is that one\nquarter of one freshmen will become a booting funk trombone man. Other interesting\nstatistical forecasts from the same source indicate that this year will see the emergence\nof twelve traditional clarinettists, half a bass\nplayer, one third of a modern drummer, one\npuffed-cheek euphonium player, no less than\nseventeen washboard soloists, a close approximation to one quarter of a soul pianist, together with one eighth of a cor-anglais player\nand ninety seven banjoists. Assuming the validity of the Rimshot statistics, the pooling of\nthis varied and curious musical talent should\nproduce a provocative new noise.\nThe modern Jazz Quartet recently completed a tour of this country. The Imperial\nCollege Jazz Club were, as usual, behind\ntheir ica-crea ni trays at the Hammersmith\nGaumont. In between melting banana splits\nI enjoyed four of their shows, And like stayed\nawake the whole time! In small doses the\nM.J. Q. are a very pla sant noise ,but a whole\nshow, Bugsville. The John Lewis approach\nto jazz is static, man. A quartet using these\ninstruments (vibes, piano, bass, drums) cannot\nproduce a very wide range of overall sound.\nAfter an hour and half's listening I 've had\nenough, not notwithstanding the incredible\nMilt Jackson. Milts vibes solos were mostly\na gas \u2014 fabulous technique and ideas. John\nLewis' dull tone on piano and his too polite\napproach took much of the edge of some interesting phrases. Percy Heath's bass playing\nwas often out of tune, and Connie Kay's drumming was fair. In the last show, however.\nRonnie Ross (baritone sax) appeared as guest.\nRoss is just what this group needs, and his\nbeautiful tone, inherent sense of swing and\nimmaculate phrasing gave great lift to the\ngroup. Numbers I enjoyed were \"The Animal\nDance\", from the ballet \"Original Sin\", \"If\nYou were Eve\" also from O.S., and \"bag's Groove\". All these featured Ross.\nI.C.'s Jazz Club President, trombone\nplayer, Ken Gibson, completed a tour with the\nRed Prince Orohestra this summer. Ask him\nfor some stories about Jimmy Skidmore's grandmother. Ken is now making a tentative\nstudy of the puffed- cheek trombone method,\notherwise known as Lip Pucker.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL. COLLEGE UNION NO. 165 FRIDAY, OCTOBER13 TH1961 PRICF 4n REFECTORIES The return of the under g rau dates last week\nand the influx of fresher s has again brought\nthe inadequacy of the refectory facilities to\nour notice. At lunchtime the crush in the\nUnion is almost unbearable, with the queue\nfor the lower refectory stretching into the\nUnion entrance and the Snack Bar queue well\ninto the arch wav. And the usual complaints\nof cool and u nap pet ising food are to be heard\nagain.\nThere is a tendency to put the blame for\nthis admittedly unsatisfactory situation entirely on the shoulders of the refectory manager\nand the refectory committee, but a knowledge\nof the matter shows that the manager and\nthe committee are. in fact, doing their best\nunder extremely frying conditions. For in-stance, there is only one kitchen in the Union\nbuilding, tucked away behind the lower re-fec tory, and meals for the Dining Hall and\nthe Upper Refectory have to be cooked here\n\u2022and transported, by lift. This ld t chen was\ndesigned to cater for 800 at lunchtimes,\nwhereas in fact. 1300 lunches are cooked\nthere in the two-hour lunch period, and many\nof the manager's problems stem from (this\ngross overloading of the only kitchen. Also\nthe staff have to be paid for 52 weeks of the\nyear while the majority are only really needed\nfor 30, which increases the refectory costs,\nand hence the price of the meals enormous-ly.\nOf the long term remedies, next October\nthere will be at least one of the new South\nside refectories open, and Week's Hall will\nbe providing lunches, although Ayrton Hall\nwill be closed and demolished next Easter.\nSince the College generally is relatively quiet\nduring the summer term, and the refectories\nmuch less busy, this should not be a serious\ndifficulty. It is eventually planned to have\nthree refectories on South Side and there will\nalso be refectories on the Island site when this\nis completed. Even so, the increase in refectory accommodation twill hardly keep pace\nwith the increasing student numbers.\nWhat can be done now to alleviate the\nposition? First of all, students can help b v using the existing facilities to the best ad-vantage; for instance, Ayrton Hall could be\nused more at lunchtime, thus easing the load\non the Union, and it does not seem to be\ngenerally known that suppers are served a*178 Queen's Gate. This service is available\nto all members of the College, provided that\ncollar, tie and jacket are worn, as in the Dining Hall, and the meals with waitress service\nare 6d. to Is. dearer than the usual self-ser-vice meals. If this is not better patronised, it\nwill have to close down at Christmas, which\nseems a pity in view of the shortage of refectory facilities.\nFinally, the queues would be reduced enormously if students would have their money,\npreferably the correct amount, ready for the\ncashier, for most of the delays are at the\ncashier's end of the counter. Attenltion to\nthese points will reduce the delays, and we\nmust bear with Mr. Mooney and his staff\nuntil better cooking facilities are available.\nPROPOGANDA\nRECEIVED\nThe Editor receives every week several\nnewsletters, usually pro- or anticommunist\npropaganda, including the International\nUnion of Students news bulletin. If any student at this College wishes to receive this the\nEditor will be glad to pass it on. Drop a note in the Union rack.\nAmong this week's post was a brotherly\nletter from the Editor of Sennet the University newspaper, inviting me to call in at their\noffice any time, and a mysterious note an-no uci ng the opening of the Electrical Department Workshops on April l st,1984; the\nceremony will be performed by Superintendant Emeritus C.C. Mills, when \"a machine\nwill be switched on\".\nWhen3\nbu le meets3 bu le During the filming of \"The Girl on the Boat\", starring Norman Wisdom, outside R.C.M. on Sunday, our photographer ca ugh this unlikely pair in conversation.\n\n"

The Council Meeting in question was\nheld during term-time; if the members of\nI.C.C. N.D. leave College before the end of\nterm they cannot blame Council for their ab-sence.\nb. Council is not bound to inform a suspended society of the reasons for their sus-pension, and the minutes of this meeting have\nnot been approved yet.\nc. Whether Council's action is unprecedented or not irrelevant. Council acted within\nits powers as defined in the Blue Book.\nd. No body of students may call itself an\nI.C. Society unless it is a properly constituted\nUnion society. The constitution of the former\nI.C.C. N.D. has been suspended and therefore\nthe students whom Mr. Fuchs represents have\nno right to call themselves \"the Committeeelect of the I.C.C. N.D. Club.\"\nDear Sir,\nThe fresher s' hop was very enjoyable, and\nas a fresher might I congratulate the Entertainments Committee on the good show it\nput on: Only one thing marred an otherwise\nexcellent evening. I went into the bar and\nfound that there were a number of drunken\nstudents singing filthy songs and throwing\nbeer around. Everyone to his own taste, of\ncourse, but I think it's a little selfish of the ie people to take over the bar in this fashion\nand not to allow anyone 'to have a quiet\ndrink. Perhaps, one evening a week could be\nset a side for singing and horseplay thus, leaving the other six free for those who want to\nuse the bar for civilised drinking.\nYours faithfully,\nG. Thomas Phys. 1.\nDear Sir,\nIt may well be noticed by the objective\nobserver that the Guilds Executive is now\n90% Chem. Eng. As a member of Guilds and\na non-member of Chem.Eng I suggest that\nthe rest of City and Guilds secede from the\nnewly-formed CHem. Eng. Union, for it is\nperfectly obvious that an underhand campaign has been waged by the 3rd year Chem.\nEng. which owing to the apathy of the rest\nof City and Guilds has been wholly successful\nIt is for these reasons that I suggest that\nlike the E.T. U., Chem. Eng.. be expelled from\nthe Union, or alternatively, the Union be expelled from Chem. Eng. As I value my skin\n(why? \u2014 Ed.) and am not sure which direction my soul will go, I request that you accept\nmy signature as,\nAn irate Guildsman\nN.B.

Eng., though the Entertianments Committee is entirely composed of\nChemical Engineers.\nEditor\nDear Sir.\nI see that once again the College have\nallowed a large number of young ladies to\nenter this predominantly male establishments.\nI have nothing against women generally, but\nreally! When will the authorities realise that\na small number of jeunes filles is worse than\nnone at all? Later this session, I expect that\nthe old motion about allowing women into\nthe bar will raise its ugly head, and the same\nold arguments for and against will be resurrected. I think it would be a good idea to forestall this inevitable rep ech age with a motion\nwhich, although it might not allow av much\nhot air to be vented to atmosphere, will at\nleast be novel. The motion is this: \"This\nUnion views with alarm the continued selection of young women in numbers insufficient\nto supply the demand of all students, and recommends to the Governing Body that a complete overhaul of the method of selection of\nwomen students is necessary. The Union\nwould suggest that the entry qualifications\nshould be changed from three advanced to\n35-26-36.\" / put it to you all that altho ug ji the women be just as much a nuisance as they\never were, they would be infinitely more\npleasing to look upon.\nYours faithfully,\nA.

We had three full games\ngoing at the trials and we hope to run seven\nnormal teams this season and one abnormal\nteam which will be the most exclusive of the\nlot, under the general misdirection of Ben\nHindley, who will, by definition, be the pivot\nof the attack.\nCongratulations to Max Finney, who turned\nup in his usual state of semi-paralysis for last\nSaturday's trial and scored all five goals.

But with trials over, in\nwhich a number of useful fresher s have been\nfound, the energies can be concentrated on\nraising the playing standard throughout the\nClub.\nThose who played in the trials should look\nup on the Club notice board next to the bar\nand tick off when their names are on a team\nshe t or on the reserves list and they will get\na game. If there is anyone who missed the\ntrials and would like to play they should\ncontact the Hon.

It will\nbe a hard campaign for I.C. with Kings and\nU.C. in the same half of the draw, but the\nClub has the ability to retain the Cup and\nuphold their reputation as the strongest Club\nin the University.

The\nteam was composed of the better members\nof the club, and toured the West Country\nand Cornwall. The team sailed in many types\nof boat new to them including Hornets, Enterprises, GP14's, and [National 12's. The\nweather was very encouraging and everywhere the hospitality extended to the team\nwas excellent. /The team members were\nhoused in tents and travelled in three cars,\nlearning the outdoor life in some cases for\nthe first time, in one of the highlights\nof the tour, the navy was vanquished\nin true style on their own doorsteps in\nPlymouth by the team who won 1, 2.\n3, 4.\nRacing was cancelled over t ne next\nfew days, which were not without amusing\nincidents.

    "content": "FELIX7 \u2014\nThe Personality of Mr. Khrushchov\nEvery seat, stair and gangway of the \u00bbiain\nphysics lecture theatre packed on Thursday,\nOctober 5th as the first of the term's lunch-hour General Studies lectures was given. Sir\nWilliam Haytor, former British Ambassador\nin Moscow, mingled biographical fact with\npersonal anecdote to paint a vivid picture of\nthe remarkable leader of Soviet Russia.\nIn spite of the Communistic theory that\nTrends and Ideas have more e ffff ect than personalities on world history, said Sir William,\nthis did not seem to be the case in Russia,\nwhere the character of the regime was vastly\ndifferent under Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchov.\nHe had been on the Embeassy staff in the\nthirties; at that time the Soviet leaders had\nbeen virtually inaccessible, and what few\nRussian friends they had were liable to disappear suddenly. It was estimated that there\nwas a labour force of ten million in the Siberian concentration camps. Nowadays these\ncamps, and the Secret Police who were\nStalin's biggest weapon, had almost entirely\ndisappeared.\nKhrushchov, unlike Lenin and Stalin,\nsprang from the socially acceptable background of the Russian peasantry. After some\nelementary schooling, as evidenced by his\nknowledge of the Bible, he went to work as\na shepherd boy, and later labour ed in a British-owned factory. His experiences here gave\nhim a bitter hatred of capitalism and colon-i al is m. His official biographies are strangely silent\non whether or not he fought in the First World\nWar. He joined the Communist Party a year\nor two after the Revolution, and soon became\none of the professional organisers. Somehow,\nhe managed to hold his own among trie\npurges and tyrannies of the Stalin era, and at\nthe dictator's death he was one of the Party's top men.\nDiplomats who met him in 1953, the transition period after Stalin's death, saw him as\na vehement, forceful little man with a chip\non his shoulder and an appealing ignorance\nof foreign affairs: hardly the man to oust\nMalenkov as the ruler of Russia. They were\nwrong.\nKhrushchov is not an absolute dictator, but there is no effective opposition to\nhis regime, partly because there seem to be\nno-one w no co uia replace him. On one occasion the Secretariat did vote against him;\nthe decision was later reversed by the General\nCommittee of the Party, and the delinquent\nofficials were relieved of their posts. The fate\nof Khrushchov's political rivals is usually to\nbe posted to a harmless sinecure such as that\nof Ambassador to Outer Mongolia.\nTypical of Khrushchov's personality is his\nreaction to the booing that greeted him during his visit to Britain in 1956. On finding\nout from the reluctant British Ambassador\nthat this was a gesture of disapproval, he\nturned round in the car and booed back at\nthe crowd. He had expected a cool reception\nby the Government and warm one by the\npeople; it was actually the other way round.\nEven now he apparently tends to regard the\nWestern man-in-the-street as either a deluded\nfool or a secret sympathiser. (Is this not also\na common Western view of the avar age Russian?)\nHis frequent outbursts of rage, though undoubtedly genuine, are by no means uncontrollable. He managed for instance, to conceal\nhis hatred of Stalin until it meant no harm\nto denounce him. Khrushchov combines a peasant's bluntness with a diplomat's craft, a comedian's cordiality with a tyrant's ruthless-ness, a clown's buffoonery with a statesman's wisdom. He is a fascinating character, and\nvery much a man to be reckoned with.\nFRESHER'S HOP\nHaving received a complimentary ticket for\nthis function, it would be churlish of me to\nbe rude about the entertainments commit te' j organisation. As a matter of fact the whole\naffair seemed to be very good indeed. I passed through the Concert Hall at about n 'ne\no 'clock and observed a fair number of charming young ladies, and, returning an hour later,\nnoticed a slightly smaller, though still con-side r able, number of charming young ladies:\nthe hall was well decorated, some imaginative\nuse had been made of the lighting available\nand the band appeared to be functioning\nsatisfactorily. The Entertainments Committee\nare to be congratulated on the whole affair\nand if the standard of talent is maintained the\nhops this year are going to be very crowded.\nSomething might be done to get over the\nfemales that the I.C. bar is for men only.\nNo less than eight violated, those sacred\npre c in ts on Friday night and were driven out\nby the howls of outraged men. The chairman\nof the A.C.C. hardly sets a good example,\nfor he was enticing a young ICWArian into\nthe bar on Saturday night; what is ICWA\ncoming to these days?\nFELIX SMALL ADS DO YOU need a status symbol?\nAnd/or are you sick of the L.T.E.? Why not purchase your independence\nin a form of a Series 1 MORRIS8 for only \u00a320.\nCONTACT A. LOGAN, CHEM. P.G.
