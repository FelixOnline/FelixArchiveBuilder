    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Music 23\nfrequency\nFun Lovin' Criminals\nMimosa\n(EMI)\nLounge music. Lounge music... hmmm mmm. It's along the same lines as elevator music, airport\nmusic and musa k in the kitsch stakes, although there's a certain quiet cool about it. I mean, it's a pretty uptight cat (work with me on this one, okay) that can listen to lounge music for any long\nstretch and not fall asleep. You've got to be a real square not to relax to it, man. (Come on, give\nme a break, I'm trying to be cool and with it. I 'll just stop it, shall I?) Cool lounge gro ovi ness is all well and good but when it's presented by one of the most laid-back\nbands ever as an alternative to their more pop-cool orientated sounds then you have to wonder.\nI'm always a bit suspicious when a band release an album of b sides or unreleased numbers\nunless (a) they've split up or (b) one of them has died, as Queen do regularly. Oasis did The Masterplan last year and I felt that it was an excuse to make more money from their fans even though\nthey couldn't be arse d to write a new album, and I have that same feeling about Mimosa.\nTo kick off, we've got five (count 'em) tracks taken from the album Come Find Yourself, and even\none of those is a cover. All five are different versions, mainly titled Schmoove, but out of eleven\ntracks it's a hell of a large number. The rest are covers of a variety of musicians but all have a distinctly Vic and Bob club-style about them. I am perhaps being a tad harsh on what is, in all a fair album. There's an Ozzy track, Crazy Train that's pure piss-take, and a cover of the Sinatra\nsong The Summer Wind with a guest appearance from Echo and The Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch. All the FLC alternative versions are rather fun to listen to, with Huey on Scooby Snacks\nsounding as though he's one step away from a coma and a general feel throughout the whole\nalbum of them not actually giving a shit. Mimosa will certainly appeal to FLC fanatics but there's more than just that. The album is sufficiently different for it to be a worthwhile move for even a part-time fan to give it a listen. I still think that it's another cheap way of making money though.\nSouth Park\nMr Hanky's Christmas Classics\n(Columbia)\nPoo. What a great word. Try saying it out loud, especially if you're reading this during a lecture. See how many\npeople look at you and laugh. This album is mostly\nabout shit and coincidentally most of it is shit. Okay, so\nit's funny the first time you hear it, but the second listen\nbecomes tiresome very quickly. First song, a primary\nschool snigger-along. Second, an over-offensive\nracist/blasphemous ditty. Then the tuneless singing of a Christmas carol by South Park characters. Repeat these\nthemes for fifty minutes. Nice. Don't get me wrong, I love\nSouth Park, but this thing is more reminiscent of the\nICSM publication, Prince Albert - smutty whilst being\ncompletely devoid of humour. Perhaps it's meant to\noffend and shock, but I just found it plain dull.\nThe high point of the album is an absurd Meatloaf send\nup, Swiss colony beef log, sung by Cartman, but the rest\nof the music can be generously described as being TVadvert quality. This CD deserves to be reduced to ashes\nalong with all the rest of the cheap cash-ins released in\ntime for Christmas. Even the mandatory Chef song is dire.\nVerdict: 5 stars for the first listen, 0 thereafter. So Felix\ngives it one, and recommends that you steer well clear.\nChristian Hardy\nmore stocking filler recommendations\nGomez - Liquid Skin\nGomez set themselves among musics major players with this release. Liquid Skin is an excellent follow up to Bring It On and every self respecting student should own both.\nGroove Armada - Vertigo\nAs they'd say themselves, 'if you're fond of sand\ndunes...' you'll adore this chilled offering from\nthese London boys. It also includes the new ICU\nanthem / See You Baby, but unfortunately you'll\nhave to buy the single to get the thumping Fat Boy\nSlim remix.\nMoby - Play\nMoby's Why Does My Heart Feel So Sad? ran No\nScrubs close for Felix's Single of the Year. Play is a fabulous record with all the usual Moby twists.\nMogwai - Come on Die Young\nLyricless and slow, this album is not one for the\ndepressed or easily upset. Its release was also\nignored by many but this is a work of art.\nBeth Orton - Central Reservations\nThis probably deserved to win the Mercury Music\nPrize (the winner of which passes without a mention here).\nStereophonies - Performance and Cocktails\nThey may sound a bit too much like Radiohead\ndid five years ago, but all is forgiven considering\nthe catch in ess of the songs.\nMercury Rev - Deserter's Songs\nNot from this year, but as this my favourite from\n1 998, this superb album mange s to squeeze into\nthis box. It's a beautiful album both musically and\nlyrically, and the composition is at times simply\nbreathtaking. It's also better than anything to\ncome out this year, and that's saying quite a lot\nconsidering the quality on these pages\n\n"

    "content": "10 Travel Feature Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\n1 W UH\nThe Great Wall - Photos Gareth\nt hina's another world. It's not\njust the distance or the different culture. There's something\nin r ngu ingly other about the whole\nexperience of a trip there. The similarities are there, but in a way they\nadd to the sense of being far from\nhome. Not that I'm overly sentimental about England y 'understand, but\neverything you see is viewed through\nthe filters that are part of the point of\nreference we call our own. I can't even hope to do justice to a country\nof a billion people in this article, only\nto describe the glimpses of the country and culture that I 've seen.\nWhen my old school asked if I'd be interested in joining their expedition to China, I jumped at the\nchance. Three weeks in one of the\nworld's most diverse and compelling\ndestinations was too good an\nopportunity to miss, even if it left me\ntoo broke to do a great deal else\nthat summer.\n\u2022\"^o, along with seven Year 12\n(lower sixth in old money) stu-I dents and two teachers, I found myself sat in an Air China\n747, with only a vague idea of what\nto expect. Economy flights are much\nof a much ness; if you've been on\none, you've seen most of what they\noffer. No views ('ce pt cloud) and not\na great deal in the way of entertain-ment, especially as most of your\nfriends have taken the opportunity to\ncatch up on sleep, diaries or what-ever. This one was alright. Ten hours\nlater we bounced down in Beijing.\nOur first contact with Chinese\nofficialdom was fairly painless - just\nthe briefest of glances at our group\nvisa and passports and we were\nthrough. Shame we didn't get\nstamped, but you can't have every-thing. It was lucky for us that it was\nbrief, because the heat and humidity in Beijing had come as quite a shock. It was overcast, but must\nhave been over 35\u00b0C. The air here\nseemed to have been marinated in\nThe first British school expedition to China took place last July.\nGareth Morgan helped to lead it, and this is what he thought...\ndiesel for a few hours before being\nslowly pressure-cooked, so none of\nthe moisture was lost. It was heavy,\nmuggy and distinctly worrying,\nalthough it never really got any\nworse.\nBeijing is China's political and\ncultural heart. Substantially rebuilt\nwhen the Communists took over in\n1949, it is a combination of ugly\napartment blocks, glittering skyscrapers and building sites. Reminds\nme of somewhere not a million miles\naway, actually. And even/where there\nare adverts. Hoardings sprout in\nevery available space, and neon\nsigns decorate many buildings. Beijing's twelve million people seem to\nthrong the streets - everywhere\nseems busy, bustling with frenetic\nenergy. The impression is of splashes of colour in a sea of grey,\nalthough this was probably due in\npart to the unbroken cloud cover.\nWe took a minibus to our hotel,\npicking up a few basic words in\nMandarin from our guide on the\nway. A combination of fatigue and\nwonder at our new surroundings\nkept us fairly quiet. We found\nenough energy to go out for a meal\nand a drink, and were impressed to\nfind a Starbucks Coffee shop across\nthe road. Nice. Chinese food is\namong the most diverse and interesting in the world, and although we\nonly tried a small selection it was\ncertainly an experience. More\nimportantly, beer is cheaper than\nbottled water, and really rather\ngood. It's generally a pleasant, easily drinkable lager that, for an average of 30 pence a bottle, is a damn\nfine idea. This is more than can be\nsaid for their spirits, which resemble\ncheap and nasty paint stripper.\nLaughably cheap, though.\nThe Forbidden City is one of Beijing's most famous landmarks, and\nit's certainly impressive. The Emperors' home and court from the fifteenth century until the end of the\nEmpire in 1912 is a huge complex\nof halls and courtyards, intricately\ndecorated and thick with tradition. It\nwas our first encounter with China's rich history and with the tourist presence that envelopes most of China's attractions. But more of that later.\nNext stop was Tian'an men Square, which is as potent a symbol\nof modern China as anything I 've\ncome across. It's huge - a vast\npaved area flanked by the massive\nparliament building and Museum of\nPeople's History, which sports a big\nneon countdown to the handover of\nMaccau in a couple of weeks.\nTian'an men Gate, at the northern\nend, would look massive anywhere\nelse, but looks slightly odd with a huge portrait of Mao Zedong on it.\nMao's Mausoleum sits on the\nsquare, looking out of place and\nreducing the impact of the square's size. We didn't take the chance to go\nin and see his body, which is taken\nout of a freezer every day for the\nthousands of tourists who visit the\nsquare. It was impossible to forget\nthe massacre there ten years ago,\ndespite the families of tourists and\nrecent renovation. It was decidedly\nbleak and unfriendly on this dull\nTuesday morning, but it would have\nbeen impossible to miss it out and\nI'm glad we saw it.\nIt was nice to get out of Beijing\nto see the Great Wall. It's impossible\nto describe it effectively, but it is\nun imaginably long, stretching off\nacross steep hills over both horizons.\nThe effort and expenditure required\nto build, maintain and man it are\nawesome. It's by far the biggest and\nmost impressive waste of resources\nin human history - millions of men,\nhundreds of years, and it achieved\nprecisely nothing. Invading armies\nmerely avoided it, bribed the\nguards, or came in from the other\ndirection. It makes the Millennium\nDome seem almost worthwhile in\ncomparison.\nWe saw two sections: one\nreconstructed stretch near Beijing,\nwhich was stunning but a little\ntourist-ridden. Later we stayed at a small village a bit further afield and\nwalked on some original, 2500 year\nold wall. This was lovely: deserted,\nwe ran over spectacular scenery in\nmute testament to its builders skills.\nThe thick mist obscured the surrounding hills but added to the\natmosphere and sense of isolation.\nAfter being soundly thrashed at\nbasketball by a local village school,\nwe returned to Beijing. Another day\nof sightseeing, including the Temple\nof Heaven and the Summer Palace,\nthen we took a sleeper train to\nShanghai.\nThe Terracotta Army, Xi'an\n\n"

President Tasha Newton explained \"Over\nthe summer there was an idea from\nCollege that all students should be\nmoved into one hall, to look after\nthem all in one place\". That idea has\nsince been dropped by the RCSR and\nit has been decided that people\nshould stay in their own hall, but\nshould explicitly state whether they\nwill be there or not.\nMany students have expressed\nconcern over the fact that they will not\nhave the freedom of deciding at the\nlast minute whether or not they want\nto stay in London during this period,\nand there has been a suggestion that\nCollege are in breech of contract on\nthe matter.\nQuestionnaires were distributed\nto all halls in November, instructing\nstudents to state 'yes' or 'no' as to\nwhether they will be staying in Halls\nover the millennium weekend, of\nwhich only an estimated 600-800\nwere returned.\nResidences Manager Sharine\nBrown stated in a letter to students\nthat \"wardens have been instructed\nHappy new year Photo: Jonas\nnot to grant permission for any guests\nto be in Hall between 1 8.00 hours on\n27th December 1 999 and 1 8.00 on\n2nd January 2000\". The letter went\non to say that failure to comply with\nthese terms will be considered a \"dis-c ipl in ary offence\". Kevin Butcher,\nDeputy President (Education & Welfare) commented that \"barring students access to their rooms is unfair\",\nand the action is merely scare mongering by the College to prevent too\nmany celebrating students staying in\nHall over the millennium period, and\nthereby causing a heavy demand on\na depleted Warden and security ser v ice.\nA particular group affected has\nbeen the international population,\nwho live a long way from home and\nhave not seen loved ones for some\ntime. One such student had arranged\nin advance for his girlfriend to stay\nwith him in hall over the Christmas\nholiday, and up until the Accommodation Office stepped in, he was told\nthis would be fine. Confusion set in\nwhen the letter was received, informing him that the guest would not be\nallowed. After some distress, it was\nestablished that as long as the matter\nof deciding to stay in Halls is sorted\nout locally (ie so the Wardens and\nsecurity of the Hall know you are\nthere), then there shouldn't be a pro b lem. Mr Butcher explained \"it is the\nUnion's job to tell students this\".\nThankfully, that case has now been\nsorted out, and the girlfriend can stay.\nICU is currently attempting to\nrectify the mass confusion, and is trying to let students know that as long\nas the Wardens and security know,\nthey are well within rights to have\naccess to rooms.\nIn Brief\npia yo irs ana r ix rur es CAMBRIDGE FAILED BY\nINSPECTORATE\nLeading teacher training institution\nHomerton College, Cambridge,\nhas failed an inspection by the\nschools standards watchdog, Ofsted. The inspectorate said that two\nout of six of Homerton's post grad training courses in physical education were \"poor\".\nBEER IS GOOD FOR\nYOU IT'S OFFICIAL\nBelgian scientists have found evidence to suggest that teenagers'\nconsumption of soft drinks rather\nthan weak beer is linked to breast\ncancer. The study, reported in New\nScientist, shows that levels of the\nblood sugar regulating hormone\ninsulin rise rapidly after drinking\nsugar-filled soft drinks, but not\nafter drinking weak (about 1%\nalcohol by volume) beer, which\ncontains more complex carbohydrates. Inappropriate insulin\nrelease during breast development\nis thought to be involved in cancer,\nalthough the mechanisms are currently speculative.\nLEEDS AWARDED \u00a320\nFOR INNOVATION\nLeeds University has been massively buoyed by an investment of \u00a320\nmillion from finance giant the Forward Group, deigned to help academics to commercial is e new\nideas.\nAlan Wilson, Leeds Vice Chancellor, said he was thrilled with the\nagreement, which had taken about\n1 8 months to put together. A new\nmanagement structure will offer\ndedicated expertise to academics\nwanting to take their inventions to\nthe market.\nRESEARCH: IS IT\nREALLY WORTH IT?\nVice Chancellors have asked\nresearchers to update a study of\nthe relationship between basic\nresearch and economic perform-ance, to further back-up their\ndemands for more cash from the\ngovernment. Although comprehensive work was carried out by statisticians at Sussex University in\n1 996, these findings have now ben\nseriously questioned, as they\napparently \"over emphasised the\nimportance of the ability of basic\nresearch to generate useful new\ninformation\".\n\n"

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Travel Feature 11\n\u2022\u2022life\nThe Temple Of Heaven, Beijing\nMy first impression of Shanghai was that it's like Beijing,\nbut more so. Bigger, shinier,\nrasher, louder. The colonial\nhistory has left it even more Westernised than the rest of China, and after\nforty years of Communist neglect, it's come back to life with a vengeance.\nIt's great. Across the river from the\nold waterfront, the Bund, there used\nto be fields. Ten years ago the area\nwas designated a Special Economic\nZone and there's now one of the\nmost attractive and impressive\ncityscape sI 've ever seen. Shanghai is\nheading towards being one of the\nworld's biggest economic centres,\nand the recent Asian economic problems don't seem to have slowed it\ndown. There's a sense of urgent\nambition about the city - they're in\nthe process of building a new underground network from scratch, for\ninstance, and the one line that's open\nis really rather nice. Definitely a city to\ncheck out as the nightlife scene\nexpands.\nShanghai - and indeed most big\ncities - seems at first glance to be\nmarginally less Communist than, say,\nWashington DC, which is somewhat\nsurprising. We weren't expecting\nChina to be more capitalist than\nBritain. There are aspects of life which\nare classically Communist, but I'm still not sure what Chinese Communism is. There's a different collective\nphilosophy on life, but whether this is\ndue to the people's politics or not I don't know.\nThere is some evidence of Governmental control: there is no free\npress for instance, and the newspapers and TV news have a distinct ring\nof propaganda. There are also police\nand military personnel around every-where, but this isn't necessarily a bad\nthing.\n(\u2022rafter a few days in Shanghai and\n\u2022Jm some nearby cities, we flew to\n\u2022 I Xi'an for one of the trip's high\npoints: the Terracotta Army. This\narcheological site shows some of the\nbest and worst aspects of tourist sites\nin China. In the late 70's, farmers\ndiscovered a buried army of pottery\nwarriors, dating back to around\n500BCE, when the first Qin Emperor\nordered them to be interred with him\nto guard his tomb. There are several\nthousand, arrayed in battle formation\nin a series of huge pits. The Army is\nan incredible sight - each warrior is\nindividually crafted to resemble a member of the army, from ordinary\nsoldiers to generals.\nThe site itself, however, is a bit\ndisappointing. There are huge aircraft hanger-type buildings over the\npits, which detract from the spectacle\nof the Warriors, and the whole area\nseems a little sterile. Even a few\narchaeologists working on the figures\nwould have made a big difference,\nbut although work is clearly ongoing,\nwe didn't see any of it. Worse though\nare the hordes of souvenir vendors\nwho surround the site, making it an\neffort to even get in without inadvertently buying a small heap of tacky\nmerchandise. They're fairly minor\ngripes, but because it was a similar\nstory at so many places that it started\nto get very annoying.\nAlthough we'd specifically asked\nfor a low cost trip where we could get\nas much of a feel for real life in\nChina, we didn't really get it. What\nwe did get was the whole tourist treat-ment: nice hotels, pre-arranged\nmeals, comfortable transport (except\nfor minibuses; I 've never had an\nenjoyable minibus journey in my life,\nand don't expect to) and a general\nshowcasing of China's media-friend-ly face. We did manage to see a little of what life is like for the hundreds\nof millions of ordinary Chinese pe o ple, though. A trip down the Grand\nCanal gave us some impressive views\nof Soviet-style heavy industry, and out\nin the countryside people farmed as\nthey have done for millennia. I even\nsaw people leading water buffaloes\nby pieces of string.\n\u2022 ea ving Xi'an we headed to\nI Sichuan Province to climb\nl^r f mountains and see pandas. It's a beautiful area, and it was great to\nget out and do some real walking,\neven if the locals were occasionally\nsomewhat depressing. Seeing girls in\nplatform shoes walking the other way\ndoesn't do a great deal for your self-esteem when you're kit ted out in\nGoretex and boots. We climbed Emei\nShan, one of China's holy Buddhist\nmountains. Unfortunately it rained\nthe whole time we were on it,\nalthough it cleared up after we came\ndown. There was an incredibly, eerie\nchorus of insects on the lower slopes:\na coherent, undulating wail, rather\nthan the cacophony usually associated with cicadas and suchlike.\nWe also did the only charitable\ndeed we managed to arrange in\nSichuan. China is notoriously un receptive to foreign charities, and\nalthough we tried to link up with\ngroups like WaterAid, we had considerable difficulties. We did manage to\nvisit a fairly remote school, where we\nmet some of their more disadvantaged students and sponsored them\nfor a year, as well as donating several kilos of assorted stationary. It was a fairly minor gesture, but we wanted to\nat least put something back into the\ncountry\nThe Wolong Panda Reserve is a National Park among Sichuan's mountains, and there's a breeding\ncentre an hour or so's drive up a spectacular valley. Giant pandas are\nnot the world's greatest evolutionary\nsuccess stories, and as there are only\nabout a thousand of them left, due to\nthe destruction of their habitat,\nthey're going to need all the help\nthey can get. They're lovely creatures:\nbig, docile, expressive, and easy to\nfall for. Although run by the WWF, the\ncentre seems a bit of a forgotten pro j ect. It's a bit basic in places, but\nthey're building a series of semi-nat-ural enclosures where the pandas\ncan enjoy much more freedom and\nspace than their current, somewhat\ncramped, cages. They're having\nmore success breeding pandas there\nthan anywhere else, though.\nOur final destination was Guilin,\nwhere the limestone scenery is world-renowned. There are literally thousands of small hills sticking up from a huge flat plain, and seen together\nthey're breathtakingly attractive.\nRows of hills fade into the distance,\ngiving the area an ethereal quality\nthat matches the pace of life in the\nfields and villages nearby. We took a cruise up the river to Yangshuo, a village that's just in the nice, backpack-er-friendly phase of a tourist re vol u tion. The view of a night-time thunderstorm silhouetting the hills is one\nthat I hope to keep with me all my\nlife.\n5\n0 that's about if. China's a fascinating place, and I only\nscratched the surface of what it\nD offer. Travelling independently\nwould cost a lot more than we paid\n(I'd budget around \u00a32-3000, including travel, mid-range accommodation and all the places we visited) but\nwould be a worthwhile and fascinating experience. There are opportunities to teach over there, which could\nbe great, but I'd take care about who\nyou arrange it through. And for anyone whose career involves a lot of\ntravel, I'd definitely recommend Beijing and Shanghai as being worthwhile destinations. I can't think of\nanother country with such a range of\nexperiences and contrasts as China,\nand if you're thinking of going travelling there are few more intriguing\ndestinations. Go for it: you only live\nonce.\nA giant panda at the Wolong Reserve, Sichuan Province\n\n"

Your editorial on the meaning of Christmas\nwas interesting if not anything\nelse.\nJesus Christ is an historical\nfigure. Whether or not you\nbelieve that does not change that\nfact. I would be interested to hear\nhow you feel you can prove that\nJesus never existed As to whether\nor not you believe the claims that\nhe made about himself that is a different fact, but there are very\nfew people who would like to\nargue the point that he never\nexisted.\nTo ask the question as to why\nthe celebration of his birth is\nimportant to this country (and the\nworld) shows a complete ignorance of the history of Christianity throughout the last 2000 years\nand the effect that it has had on\nworld history. In the countries\nwhere Islam and Judaism have\nbeen important forces there are\nsocial events surrounding the\nrespective Holy days.\nPlease tell me which majority\nof the population do not believe\nin Jesus Christ. Muslims, Hindus\nand Christians all believe in Jesus\nin one form or another. The fact\nthat the academic world has been\npermeated by a naturalistic philosophy of the world does not\nmean that the majority of the\npopulation believe it or that the\nphilosophy is correct.\nRanti Atijosan & Sarah Davies\nTo the editor,\nIt saddened me greatly to\nread your statements in the editorial about Christmas and the new\nyear.\nThe first thing that struck me\nwas that you wrote that Jesus was\na mythical figure. I can under-Feedback\nstand that some people do not\nbelieve the claim of Jesus that he\nwas/is God. However, to claim\nthat he did not exist at all is to go\nagainst all the evidence. I would\nsuggest that you not only read the\nbible, but read some of the works\nof Josephus, a first century secular historian who wrote about\nJesus and the following that he\nhad. This is a historical source\nfrom the time!\nI also found your remarks\nabout thanksgiving interesting.\nAgain I feel that you showed a lack of knowledge about this festival as well. Thanksgiving was set\nup by Abraham Lincoln to remind\nthe people of America what they\nowed to God (the Christian God).\nSo here we have two festivals\nthat, at their fundamental level,\nare about Jesus Christ, so to celebrate them any other way is to\nremove the truth from them.\nAs for Christmas, what is it all\nabout?? One has to ask that if\nJesus was God, why did he\nbecome human?\nThe answer is a humbling\none. It is that all the things that\nwe do that break the law of God,\nevery single one of them, are\ndeserving of death, and there is\nnothing that WE can do about it.\nBut God did not want to leave us\nin this state, and so, became a man, one that did not break\nGod's law. He then died in our\nplace, paying the price for our\ncrimes. He then was resurrected\nfrom the dead so that we can be\nwith him when we die, should we\nchoose to.\nWhat everyone has to decide\nis whether this is true, because if\nit is, the consequences are huge.\nIt involves a massive choice\nchoose not to follow Christ, or\nchoose to follow Chist. This is not\nsomething to be taken lightly, it is\nthe biggest choice that anyone\never takes. I would suggest that\nthis Christmas, everyone should\nthink about what the whole thing\nis about and make their decision,\nYours sincerely,\nAndy Haden\nDear Sir,\nI have just read your editorial\nabout the meaning of Christmas,\nand felt compelled to reply. The\nvast majority of historians would\ndisagree with you about your\nbelief that Jesus is a mythical fig-ure, that is the equivalent of saying that Julius Caesar or that your\ngreat\u2014grandfather are mythical\nfigures, there is plenty of evidence outside the Bible itself that\nverifies that Jesus Christ of\nNazareth lived and died on a cross in Palestine 2000 years\nago. Where most people dispute\nthe reality of Christianity is not\nover the existence of Jesus, but\nover his resurrection, the fact that\nhe is God and furthermore, that\nhe is alive now. Christians believe\nthat there is enough evidence of\nthe resurrection of Christ to\nbelieve what he said about him-self, what he came to do and\nwhat the future holds, and to put\ntheir lives completely in his\nhands.\nI'd also like to say that I agree\nwith you that organised religion is\na very bad thing; it leads to ultimate disillusionment, a permanent treadmill and emptiness.\nThat is why Christianity is so\namazing; it is not an 'organised\nreligion' but about being involved\nin a personal, loving relationship\nwith God Himself, through faith in\nChrist. No other religion offers\nthis; all other religions have standards to meet and things to\nachieve. Christianity asks for\nnone of this; there is nothing that\nyou have to do to know God and\nenjoy all his blessings, except\nrepent of your disbelief and\nbelieve! the consequences of your\nchoice are massive.\nChristmas and Easter are\nboth celebrated the world over\nand most people don't realise\nwhat was really going on. The\nworld has distorted the true\nmeaning of Christmas into \"Win-ter val\", and Easter into choco-late. Maybe subconsciously people realise that Christmas is\nimportant and needs to be ce le The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk.

    "content": "16 Union Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nt RCS Union\nY ou are sleeping during a particularly interesting lecture (aren't they all?) when,\nall of a sudden things start to go\nall wobbly and, before you have\ntime to reach for the Alka-Seltzer, a mysterious figure with a gaudy\ngreen cloak, an incredibly long\nbeard and (amazingly) even longer\ntoe-nails is standing in front of\nyou.\nThe mysterious, yet oddly\nmerry, stranger speaks: \"Do not be\nafraid.\"\n\"Oh dear,\" you think, \"Christ\nhas been reborn and I'm going to\nbe commanded to go and take a present to him.\"\n\"No,\" replies the figure, \"I am\nthe Ghost of RCSU Past. I have\ncome to show you how RCS events\nhave been celebrated before, to\ninvoke a sense of nostalgia and\nmake you feel guilty so you come\nto the next ones.\"\nThe ghost then takes your\nhand (and stabs his nails into your\npalms) and leads you through a dark corridor which has miraculously appeared under the seat two\nrows in front of you. You gradually\nregain your senses and see a charming scene laid out in front of\nyou.\n\"Ah, the Freshers' Barbecue. I remember it as though it were only\nyesterday. The dreamy smells of\nsummer were still in the air, as was\nthe aroma of those free hamburg-ers.\"\n\"Yes, happy days,\" replies the\nghost, \"and look over there.\"\nYour gaze wanders off to the\nleft where you see the serenely lit\nUnion Bar and the Freshers Bar\nNight in full swing. More worrying-ly, you see yourself swinging\naround the room in an uncontrollably happy frame of mind, after\nconsuming copious quantities of\nfree beer. Bearing this in mind, you\ncarefully ignore the Ghost of RCSU\nPast (GORP) as he nods towards\nthe images of the Freshers Pub\nCrawl and the South Ken Ten, and\nmove onto the Freshers Dinners.\n\"Wow, there I am, enjoying my\nformal dinner - don'tI look like an\nidiot in that suit?. And there's Theta, and the Dean, and all those\nnice Freshers I met, like Bob\nHatchett. Poor old Bob. He was\nfrustrated that he couldn't get onto\nthe ICU football team. Thankfully,\nhe contacted the RCSU and learnt\nabout the RCS Football team, so\nhe joined up and they're doing\nreally well in the ULU league. If\nonly the other CCUs plucked up\nthe courage and took them on.\nAnd over there is the Careers\nForum, where they explained to me\nthe best way to go about getting a job.\"\n\"You'd better take a pause\nnow,\" interjected the GORR \"or\nyour listeners will start to lose inter-est.\"\nYour view starts to wobble as\nyou see yourself on Jezebel, the\nRCSU's fire engine, collecting\nmoney for Mencap.\n\"But there's so much more.\nThere I am on the London-Brighton\nRun. The President is about to fall\nof the fire engine! Wake up Mr\nPresident, sir!\"\n\"He cannot hear you,\" says the\nGORR Forgetting this you unsuccessfully try to suppress a laugh as\nthe President is surprised to be\nwoken up - and even more surprised to fall off and to be taken to\nhospital. A copy of BroadSheet spirals into view.\n\"Ah, I remember how BroadSheet has kept me awake in lec-ture s, with its witty reviews and science news. That \u00a310 prize crossword has kept me amused for\nhours and the free Christmas angel\n(flat packed with instructions from\nICU Origami Club) was great fun.\nYou're really beginning to\nenjoy yourself when suddenly the\nlight fades...\n\"You have now seen the past,\"\nsays the GORP while fading out, \"\nand now you must face th...\"\nAlmost immediately, a large\nfemale form appears in front of\nyou. You carefully check to see if it\nis indeed female. You decide to\nreserve judgement.\n\"Welcome back to the pre s ent,\" says the figure in a strangely\nhigh pitched voice, \"where I, the\nGhost of RCSU Present, am supposed to show you how RCS events\nare celebrated now. Unfortunately,\ndue to a slight miscalculation,\nthere aren't any events within the\nnext three days, which means my\nbit is going to be quite short.

    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nfrequency >/x Led Zeppelin\nThe Best Of - Volume 1\n(Atlantic)\nOkay, I 've got my hands in the air and I'm more than willing to admit\nthat I'm a huge fan of the Zep. I'm going to be slightly swayed by nearly anything that has the best rock band ever playing on it, but I 'll be fair.\nHave you ever been asked, \"But WHY do you need that super-rare\nimport version of that album? All that's different is the colour of the\ntitle\"? I have, and the only response I can muster is the old beauty that\nbeing a fan of such sad proportions is like being addicted to crack. You\nalways tell yourself that you'll stop but you NEED more and each time\nyou get it, the buzz is that little bit weaker. This is pure speculation on\nmy part since I have never been and am not addicted to crack cocaine.\nAnyway, Early Days is a compilation of what Jimmy Page (producer of\nthe album and guitar legend) thinks are the best bits from Zeppelin's first four albums. It contains such classics as Rock And Roll, Dazed And\nConfused, Whole Lotto Love (the original version of the Top Of The Pops\ntheme) and the inevitable Stairway. In fact the entire album could be\ntitled The Beginner's Guide To The Mighty Zep because there's not a bum track on it. All the ingredients that first had me hooked are there:\nRobert Plant's screeching vocals, Pages killer hammering of the Les Paul\n(among others) and the incredible coupling of John Paul Jones' keyboard and bass wizardry with John Bonham's psycho drumming. As a feat of production and musicianship the sound can't be faulted, there's even a movie of Communication Breakdown on the ECD. I'm in Led\nZep heaven...\nAnd then I think a little. Why, in light of past releases of the boxed set\nof four CDs in 1990 and a Remasters double album in 1993, do we\nneed another greatest hits selection? Are the coffers of Led Zeppelin Inc.\nempty? I think not. Do those wonderful people at Warner Music wish to\ndo the public a favour? Don't make me laugh. All it boils down to is\nmoney, and people wanting more of it, and in that respect, Early Days\nis a stinker. In all the other ways though, this is a superb album of thirteen classic songs from the world's greatest rock band.\nChristian\nMusic Meeting Time Change\nDue to James having too much work to do music meetings will be moving back to the much more friendly time of Friday lunchtimes at\n12.30pm. To join up just come along to a meeting in the porta cabins or contact James on music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nTalking All That Jazz!\nAnd there goes the\nLondon Jazz Festival\nWell, as planed, I made my way to two of the concerts at the London Jazz\nFestival I'd written about a few weeks ago. My selection took me to see\nTaj Mahal, and Dianne Reeves at the last gig of this year's UF.\nThe first concert was very good, with the blues legend in the perfect mood,\ndoing his thing brilliantly, accompanied by six African musicians on very\nstrange instruments (Malian kora s anyone?). But the second concert certainly went beyond my very high expectations. Dianne Reeves sure is the\ngirl of a preacher man! Amen to that! She preached the righteous path to\names meri sed crowd who kept asking for more. Full of tracks from her new\nBlue Note album, Bridges (recommended to anyone whose hearing is still\nworking), the long concert was very diverse in style. She was able to switch\nfrom the bluest of moods playing Duke's Mood Indigo in duet with her\nbassist, to some heavy-beat scat numbers when the bassist opted for his\nelectric bass guitar instead of the traditional double-bass, and the percussionist was on fire.\nShe has a great interaction with the audience too, and the atmosphere\nwas fabulous. It reached its peak in my opinion when, on a slow blue\nnumber, people spontaneously started snapping their fingers in rhythm. At\nthat moment you could really grasp the passion of the crowd: they needed to express their emotion but where exactly in the timid, quiet but catchy\nmood of the melodies sketched.\nArguably, the best two jazz singers in the world right now are Dianne\nReeves and Diana Krall. And if you've missed Dianne, go and listen to\nDiana! Her previous UK concert in November last year sold out at an\namazing pace, so get a move on! By the way, I'm just mentioning this\nbecause I 've been asked the question, it is possible to dance to jazz music\nin London? Catch the 'mess in' around' so i ree at the Jazz cafe (near Camden tube station) every Saturday. It's \u00a38 and goes on from 10.30pm to\n2am. You'll have great fun.\nAnd let me add a little bit of advice here. If you want to buy a few albums\n(I 'll hopefully have a few reviews soon) here are the cheapest stores in\ncentral London: Steve's Sound at Newport Court (close to the sex-shops!)\nin Leicester Square, and Honest Jon's at 276 Portobello Road. Don't buy\nanywhere else, you'll pay more.\nFinally I'd like to wish you all a happy holiday and if can't be good be\ncareful, and remember that above all else you must keep it jazzy\nEtienne\n\n"

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Travel 9\nThe wind was minimal but the air temperature was\n-20\u00b0C, and my feet quickly became numb. This\nwas an incredibly exciting day - ascending very\nsteep snow slopes, jumping crevasses and crossing avalanche-strewn slopes at 20 000 feet. We\narrived at camp in winds of 30 knots and had\nsome serious trouble pitching tent on a ledge\nabove the ice fall. My feet had failed to thaw out since 6am and\nnow, at 2pm, I was getting slightly concerned\nabout frostbite. The star porters boiled some\nwater, which I put in my water bottle in the bottom of my sleeping bag. My concern grew, as I could not feel this bottle - which was too hot to\nhold by hand. It took 45 minutes before I was\nable to feel anything. This was an agonising wait\nand once again the dangers of mountaineering\n(which I'd only previously read about) became\nreality\nMiraculously, none of us were experiencing\nany altitude sickness at all. Murray and I were\nchatting with nervous excitement as we were\nperched 850m below the summit of a mountain\nwe'd been training to climb for four months, at\nthe crux of an expedition we'd been planning for\nsix more. Another bowl of mash, a few tunes from\nDire Straits and we drifted into a light sleep.\n[ day 4 ]\nAt 1.30am the gale force wind was threatening to blow in one side of the tent. The air\ntemperature was -25\u00b0C and we were wearing\nevery layer of clothing possible, just trying to stay\nwarm. The five minutes it took to stick on cram-pons and attach the ropes nearly proved\ndisastrous, as every part of the body froze if it was-n't moved about violently. We were quickly off up\nthe mountain, spurred on by adrenaline, the cold\nand an overwhelming drive to get to the summit.\nWe met two Americans sitting in the snow as we\nascended by the light of a full moon - they were\nextremely bright and chirp y despite the conditions.\nWe continued past them, up 45\u00b0 snow slopes\ntowards the ice fall at 6200m, but as we got closer\nthe magnitude of the sera cs towering above us\n(which had looked so small from camp 1) became\napparent. Route finding immediately became\nextremely difficult, and we continually ran up\ndead-ends between sera cs which threatened to\ntopple at any moment. We figured the only way\nup was to climb about 7m vertically up the side\nof as era c. We waited while Maximo lead the\nclimb and the cold bit through our clothes. I had\nnot felt my feet since 2am. Of more concern was\nMurray's condition - he was starting to show signs\nof his lack of acc lim at is ation and was weakening rapidly. With great difficulty and effort we\narrived on top of the sera c, and within ten meters\nwe were confronted by a crevasse three meters\nacross, at the base of the vertical face of another\nsera c. We debated this with Maximo, shouting\nagainst the wind whilst snow was driven into our\nfaces, freezing our cheeks and making it difficult\nto speak at all. We held a firm belay on Max and\nhe jumped across this crevasse, throwing the\npoints of his cramp on s and ice axes into the face\nIPs' WMffM\nGIANT\nCLIMBS\nIN PERU\nof this sera c, then traversing the face before collapsing in the snow, exhausted by his effort. With\nthe safety of Max's belay the danger was taken\nout of our leap - but the effort to traverse the sera c wasn't. We still had 400m to ascend, and the ice-fall showed no signs of relenting.\nA few more crevasses, however, and we were\nthrough, with nothing but steep snow slopes\nbetween us and the summit. As we belayed each\nother up the final stages the sun rose. Warmth\nstarted flooding into our toes, fingers and faces\nand with just a couple of hundred meters to go\nnothing was going to stop us. The shadow of the\ntwin peaks of Huascaran Sur and Norte was cast\nout like a pair of enormous breasts across the\nCordillera Negra. The scenery was breathtaking.\nBy this point Murray was moving incredibly slowly,\nstopping every ten paces and crouching over his\nice axe. Shortly after 9am we reached the sum-mit, a moment of absolute exhilaration. I threw\nmy arms involuntarily around Murray, then Paul,\nAlex and Max as we came together on the domed\npeak of Huascaran Sur. The wind hadn't relented,\nour cheeks and feet were still frozen and Murray\nwas in a terrible state. After a few photographs\nwe started our descent. The wind made communication impossible and as we descended in\nsolitude we could each try to digest our achieve-ment. It was a quite wonderful feeling of elation\nand fulfilment.\nAs we descended, we passed a lone climber\nabout 300m below the summit taking a peculiar\nline and going very slowly. It was still early in the\nday however and to get through the ice fall alone\nwould have taken some skill. He was clearly an\nexperienced mountaineer and Max waved at him\nin acknowledgement so any concerns I had were\nimmediately relinquished. He was never seen\nagain. The circumstances were extremely pec u liar. His Irish friends in the tent next to ours greeted\nus on our return to camp 2, and never put out\nan alarm call - so as we spent the rest of the day\nrelaxing in our tents we assumed he'd come down\nsafely and there was no cause for concern. On\nreflection this does seem an incredibly avoidable\ntragedy and it'll always be in the back of my mind\n- should we have said something to him to persuade him to come down?\n[ day 5 ]\nThis was probably the most difficult morning as\nthe adrenaline had passed, the dangers were\nnow minimal, it was bitterly cold, the wind was\nstronger than the previous morning and we had\nto pack up camp. We all accepted it, got on with\nthe task in hand, and then got out of there as\nquickly as possible. As we took our cramp on s off\nat the snow line it occurred to me how extraordinarily lucky we had been, not only on\nHuascaran but also with the treks, the people\nwe'd met, the weather and absolutely everything.\nWe descended 3km that day into Musho, where\nwe bought the porters a few well earned beers\nbefore heading back to celebrate in style in\nHuaraz. Roll on next summer for more of the\nsame!\n\n"

    "content": "34 Games Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nAge Of Empires II: The Age of Kings (PC)\nFor strategy gamers, Age of Empires //.The Age of Kings is one of the\nlongest awaited releases this year. I will now reveal if this sequel is worthy of its illustrious predecessor, one of the best real time strategies\naround. Those of you familiar with the first edition, The Age of Kings, will\nfind this quite similar on the surface (why mess with perfection?). In fact,\nit is the same as the first version with improvements. It is a larger game,\nhas additional strategic features and the graphics are pretty spanking too.\nIn The Age of Kings you guide your people through the Middle Ages in\n1000 years. This time you expand your kingdom and increase your level\nof technology, controlling one of 1 3 mighty civilisations such as the Celts,\nVikings, English and Japanese. You have to conquer the world, usually\nthrough a mixture of shrewd tactics, military strength, diplomacy and\ncommerce. There is no one way to win this game - you can have the\nbiggest army, the best economy or you can build a wonder of the world.\nAlong with a technological tree of more than 100 nodes, this game has\nendless options.\nOne of the great improvements over the first version is the expanded\ncombat system. There are different military formations so that you can\nhide your archers behind tough swordsmen - this was an annoying feature of the first game where you had to change formation every second,\nbecause the archers got ahead of themselves and thought they could take\non heavy cavalry and go home to tell their kids.\nAs an alternative to beating the living daylights out of your opponent, you\nnow have the choice of trading at your own market or setting up trade\nroutes with your allies (much more civilised I'm sure).\nThere are many extras to this game that add to its gameplay. Production\nqueues, improved navigation points and custom is able hot-key systems\nhave been added. In addition, more audio cues make empire management easier. Map shortcuts like gathering points make it easier for players to organise their forces and plan their battles. The campaigns are\nstory based and focused on historical figures, such as Joan of Arc,\nWilliam Wallace and Ghengis Khan (although the Scottish accent used in\nthe William Wallace campaign is dubious to say the least...but kicking\nthe English is always fun)\nI thought this game was brilliant. It has a user friendly interface with many\nneat functions. The gameplay is addictive and challenging. In my op in ion, this is simply a complete game. If you liked AoE I then you will love\nthis. If you like strategy games then you will love this. If you just like\ndecent PC games then you will love this.\nMark\nFreespace II (PC)\nThere's something about the idea of space combat that captures the\nimagination. Ever since the original Star Wars movies, kids all over the\nworld have dreamed of being Luke Skywalker, of actually flying a tiny little X Wing against the mighty Star Destroyers. Freespace 2 lets you\nrecapture that excitement.\nThe storyline is pretty basic, but that isn't the point. This game is about\nmassive deep-space dogfights between swarms of fighters, bombers and\ngigantic capital ships. Imagine your most hectic Quake 2 deathmatch,\nsubstitute space superiority fighters for the characters and you're some\nway to imagining the excitement of a big Freespace 2 brawl.\nOK, so it's not set in the Star Wars universe, but then most Star Wars\ngames are crap anyway. What Freespace 2 gives you is action, action\nand then more action. Playing the original Freespace I got so carried\naway in a dogfight once I snapped my joystick and fell off my chair, and\nthe sequel is even better.\nWhile the original Freespace was an excellent game, there were a few\nproblems with it. It had capital ships, but they were a bit wimpy for their\nsize. In Freespace 2, armed with beam lasers and flak cannons as fighter defense, and studded with assorted missile launchers and turrets, capital ships are big trouble. The graphics have also been improved greatly since the original with some really funky-looking new ships to fly. Turn\nthe sound up loud, switch all the lights off and you could almost be in\nAlpha Centurai. Get a decent surround sound system for your PC and\nthe explosions come from all around you - better than a movie any day.\nTo play properly does require a decent joystick (preferably one that\ndoesn't snap too easily) with lots of buttons, as trying to press keys on\nthe keyboard while avoiding being blown to bits is way too difficult. The\ngame is very 3D card dependent, but with graphics this good it is worth\nthe investment. Played over a LAN or on the internet it is even more fun\n- there is a huge following of the original Freespace on the web which I am sure will spread to the sequel.\nIn some ways, this is a little too similar to the original to be a truly great\ngame. Some of the new features in the sequel should have been included in the original, and FS2 still lacks any sort of experience system for\nyour wing men( who remain completely anonymous throughout the cam-pa ign). But FS2 is still so much fun it is definitely a game not to be\nmissed. Fans of the first game will love it for giving them more of what\nthey love, and, after a few missions, new players will soon see what all\nthe excitement is about .\n\u2022 Ben\n\n"

He is then launched out of\nhis wheelchair wearing a red cape, in an\nattempt to fly. \"Bib and Bob is just a bit of fluff.\nIt's not artistic, but it reminds people that there\nis more to comedy than being neat and tidy.\nMy only limitation is that there is a joke associated with a sketch - otherwise it's just a swear word or an action.\"\nWith all this in mind, Sadowitz at a distance is a disarming sight. C!o se up, plainly\nannoyed and wearing a pine green dressing\ngown, he was frankly alarming. \"Hi, erm, I 've\ncome to interview you\". Realisation dawned on\nSadowitz's face: \"I 've overslept! Come in. Can\nyou give me five minutes? I 'll put some clothes\non.\"\nI sat amid pi les of videos, CDs, playing cards\nand magic books. Sadowitz reappeared\nclothed: \"Would you like some coffee? I'm having one myself. Help yourself to food\" he\nsaid, gesticulating at the kitchen cupboards.\nSadowitz is 38. Born in New Jersey, USA,\nhe moved to Glasgow soon after. Further\n\n"

SOAS II started the day 3 points\nbehind us with a game in hand, so\nit was a vital game to win - but we\nwent into the game missing a keeper and our long range expert, JR\nAnswering the call, however, was\nStuey Cook, back for another IC\nappearance in goal - and later on in\nthe bar of course...\nThe game started in bright sun-shine, and SOAS quickly got into\ntheir stride, dominating the early\nexchanges. We were forced to\ndefend, but the back four of Buzz,\nSkippy, Sol and Tiger stifled the\nattacks, and Dino and Vas up front\nkept their defence wary. With about\nhalf an hour gone, the ball fell to\nsoftie at the edge of the box, and he\nreleased a fierce shot towards goal,\nwhich took two wicked deflections\nbefore ending up in the net past a stranded keeper. The weather then\ntook a turn for the worse, with freezing rain and a strong wind, making\nthe rest of the half a non-event.\nIn the second half it was again\nan even contest, although some\ninspired substitution work almost left\nus with an injured tiger and no-one\nleft to come on. And after taking a boot in the nose, skippy shed more\nthan a little blood for the 5th team\ncause. The second goal arrived with\n20 mins or so to go; Dino won possession on the half-way line and,\nrunning on, left the SOAS defenders\nin his wake. A cool shimmy sent the\nkeeper to ground, leaving Dino an\neasy finish and his 12th goal of the\nseason.\nSo, 2-0 final score, which puts\nus emphatically on top of the\nleague.\nAfter getting up at some god\nunearthly hour t ULU) men's team,\nwon the final UK marathon of this\nmillennium, albeit with the race\ndivided into three nine mile legs.\nYes, this was the Luton relay\nmarathon.\nWe travelled on the slowest train\nin the world, with Frank Butcher\nmanaging to disturb the rest of the\nteam by announcing that he had\nmanaged to get a photo of a14 year old girl and that he had nearly\ngotten off with her 1 5 year old sis-ter...\nIn freezing cold conditions and\nwith plenty of ice under foot, the\nmen's team's first i eg was run by\nImperial's Stan Ron. An unofficial\ncourse record gave the second leg\nrunner, Imperial's XXX Gaffer, a2 minute 26 second head start on the\nrest of the field. The third leg runner,\nFrank Butcher (from Imperial, nat u rally) was given a9 minute 45 second head start over the next relay\nteam. Surely even Imperial's Cross\nCountry captain could not lose this?\nImperial, under the heading of ULU,\nduly won by over 1 0 minutes.\nThere was also a female ULU\nteam, which again consisted mainly\nof Imperial runners. Ruth (the only\nnon Imperial student) ran the first leg\nof the day, producing a strong\nresult. She was followed by Sicky\nSarah who had to run and a new\nfind from Imperial, Gavina, who\nmanaged to produce a time which is\nprobably a female course record.\nOther than all of us being\nknacker ed by 2pm on a Sunday, the\nonly significant news about the journey home was the fact that Sicky\nSarah informed to the whole team\n(and her fiancee Daisy Boy) that she\nwas pregnant. Congratulations\nguys, never thought you had it in\nyou mate!\nAll, in all, a very successful day\nfor ULU. What would they do without Imperial?\nIN BRIEF\nFourths Football\nIC IV 4\nRHUL IV 2\nAfter a string of five defeats we\nbadly needed this win to lift our\nspirit and to qualify for the next\nround of BUSA. We started slowly,\nand the first goal came from the\nhead of Justin, who soared miles\nabove the defence to open his\naccount for IC. Once again, how-ever, we failed to hold our lead,\nand Holloway equalise d soon\nafterwards.\nAn inspired substitution led to\nour second and third soon after the\ninterval, and with some excellent\npassing and rock solid defence\nfrom new boys Pesh and Pooven,\nthe game was ours. Holloway did\npull one back, but we showed\ngreat determination, remained\nsolid, and nearly got another,\nthanks to some great work by\nNima. Eventually, however, it was\nKurt who finished the game off,\nwith as creamer into the corner to\nmake it 4-2. Great result.\nBoat Club\nThe newly housed women's rowing team were out in force at the\nBritish Indoor Rowing Championships last week.\nEach event consists of a2 km rowing machine race, and first\noff were the Under 23's. Alison,\nCaroline and Kelly ail set off\nhard in the lightweight category,\nwith Alison leading the way to\nvictory and Caroline just missing\nout on the silver. Meanwhile, in\nthe heavyweight class, Jessica\nlanded the bronze. A further\nBUSA gold came from captain\nLindsey in the open lightweight\nevent, where she finished seventh\nin a field containing some of the\ncountry's top athletes.\nElsewhere last week, Alison,\nEmma and Jess also romped\nhome with victory in the Senior 2\ncox ed4's at the head of the river\nrace. Despite a raging head\nwind and a severe crash during\nthe race, they still beat off the\nCambridge girls in a time of\n23.02.22.\nWomens Basketball\nOnce again, we hit a wall as we\nplayed against King's( how did\nUCL manage to beat them?); this\nleaves us 3rd in the league.\nHowever, we still have a chance\nto grab the title if we beat UCL\nnext term.\nAs friendly as it was supposed to be, the game against\nOxford was still very tense, especially when Dorothee, our top\nscorer, re bounder and blocker,\nhad to leave the court after her\n5th foul. Our defence remained\ntight, but it was a more difficult\nin attack, and Oxford started to\ncame back in the game - but\nfortunately it was already too\nlate.\nWell done and thanks to\neverybody for their contribution\nto this team - the commitment of\nthis year'spi ayers has improved\nthe achievement of team dra-mati call y.A special thought for\nMeredith, who was only at IC for\nthe autumn term and will not be\namong us in 2000.\nSeconds Hockey\nIC li 1\nICSM II 1\nIC win 4-3 on penalty flicks\nWhat a game - nail biting stuff for\nseventy minutes. We had the best\nof the first half, constructing many\nattacks and converting one of them\nto go in 1-0 up at half-time. The\nfire and passion of the first-half\ncontinued into the second, and\nwhen ICSM got a lucky equalise r we rallied hard, but couldn't quite\nfind the target, and the game finished 1-1, sending it to penalties.\nFive brave men stepped forward:\nJamie's went into the top left cor-ner; Andy's top right; Paul's low\nmiddle; Giles' low and crap; and\nTom tied it up, to leave the game\n3-3 after the five. Up stepped Dr\nMong, facing sudden death, and a heroic effort flew into the top corner of the net. The pressure was on\nour makeshift goalie, Twat. The\nflick was near perfect, he dived...\nand with an outstretched stick he\nedged it around the post. Hurrah!\n\n"

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Big Issue\ngood chance the first and last time you had\nany contact with your C CU was at your fresh-ers welcome. The fact that a large proportion\nof what they attempt to do is duplicated by\nother groups (who do it better), gives rise to the\npopular opinion that the CCUs are ultimately\npointless, and have no role to fulfil in the modern College structure. The argument that they\nhave become outdated self-serving remnants\nof their former selves that eat up resources and\ndo no-one any good is one which is all too\neasy to make. The next line of the argument\nusually suggests scrapping them, but this is not\nthe solution. A fresh look desperately needs to\nbe taken at the role, image and function of the\nCCUs - today's students have a very different\nattitude to those of ten years ago. For starters,\nthey no longer come to university prepared to\nfail their degrees in order to put three years of\ndedicated effort into protecting their college's mascot.\nThe present situation and\npotential future of the CCUs\nis something that is of interest to the medics. They are\neven more proud and\n'defensive' of their individual\nidentity than other groups of\nImperial students - indeed in\nmany respects they far more\nto hold onto than the rest. At\nthe moment I suspect the\nmajority of the medics don't really see ICSMSU as a CCU,\nbut rather as an entirely independent and separate entity. There are many reasons why the\nMed School SU is bigger and better than the\nothers, and though these are mainly connected\nto its recent emergence from a handful of independent organisations, it is also because\nICSMU fulfils the role played by Departmental\nSocieties in most other departments. Although\nthe Med School SU is by far the closest to running a 'proper' student union, they too have\nrealms of their role which are duplicated and\nbettered by ICU. They too ought to be focusing\non their core function - maintaining their own\nidentity, culture and customs - and it would be\na huge loss if these were in any way diluted by\ntheir proximity to IC. Ten or so years ago it\nwould have been impossible to think that the\ntraditions of the CCU's would have been\nreduced so much in significance as they have\nbeen in Mines, Guilds and the Royal College\nof Science. The way I see it, the medics have a lot more to lose than the scientists and engineers ever had. And although they are not yet\nin the same situation as the other CCUs,\nICSMSU ought to be watching and learning\nfrom their mistakes.\nWhere are the solutions going to come\nfrom? How are we going to ensure that future\n\"...elected\non the basis of\na handful of\nvotes cast in\nan uncontested\nelection\nstudents can benefit from effective, lively\nCCUs? There is a need to streamline, ratio-na lise, focus resources, and concentrate on\nkey roles; if just some of this management\nspeak was put into practice it is just possible\nthat we could end up with some viable institutions that could survive well into the new mil-lenni um. We need to increase awareness of the\nCCUs massively - people should be aware that\nthey are applying to, for example, 'The City\nand Guilds College at Imperial', yet at present\nthe CCUs do not have a significant presence in\neither the College or Alternative Prospectus.\nSimilarly, Medical School documents rarely\nrefer to Charing Cross and Mary's as the great\ninstitutions which they are. Presently, people\ncome to IC and then find out that they are also\npart of something bigger; an organisation with\nsome substantial history and background. If\nthe CCUs were more intimately associated with\nImperial, then perhaps attitudes would be different - sports clubs are an\nimportant part of maintaining\nand promoting the separate\nidentity, as are any other\nendeavours where students\ncan represent their constituent college.\nAt present, the CCUs run\nsome very important aspects\nof the union - for example,\nhosting the fresher s welcomes allows them to provide\nthe first impression incoming\nstudents get of the student body at Imperial.\nDep Socs also fall under their jurisdiction, and\nthese should be a key provider of ents and\nevents tailored to their departments. While\nICU's ents does what it does very well (namely\nWednesdays, Fridays, Balls and Carnivals),\nquite what role C&G, Mines and the RCS\nshould be playing - as the third tier in this system - needs to be clarified.\nThere are some brilliant facilities and\nopportunities provided by the Union in all its\nguises at Imperial. Too many students don't realise how fantastic ICU really is, and are too\nquick to criticise. Running the largest student\nvenue in London and providing a haven of\naffordable fun in the capital is an excellent success that many other unions would love to be\nable to even come close to. The CCUs should\nbe looking at how they can make a significant\ncontribution to student life.\nWhich will be the first CCU to step back,\nlook at the big picture and realise that -although drastic changes are required if they\nwant to survive - they do have a lot to offer\nImperial College?\nDo you have an opinion?

    "content": "12 Interview Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nThe Billion\nSo you've got your killer internet idea - how do you go about turning that into cash?\ncompany into a billion dollar business in under twenty years. In a world exclusive,\nWhat is your vision for Psion?\nThe core answer to your question is this: if you\nwere an artist in the 1870s then I would say\nyou better get yourself to Paris, and get\ninvolved with what was going on in the\nImpressionist School. There is a time and\nplace where human activity in certain areas\ntakes off. In Theoretical Physics, the era\nbetween 1 899 and 1 939 was incredibly fertile\nin Europe (in Germany, Britain and Denmark\nparticularly). In my time, this area of microcomputers is changing the world. Its perhaps\none of the most profound revolutions in\nhuman history. Like the Iron Age or the Industrial Revolution - perhaps more so even. I wanted to be involved in that because it's fun\ncreating the world, changing the world, being\nat the forefront'\nOne of things that you've managed to do successfully is to run a public company. This is\nsomething that is harder that it sounds, particularly for people who found and run their own\ncompanies. For instance, Richard Branson\nfamously withdrew his Virgin Group from the\nstock market. It is even more difficult for technology stocks, where development and market\nforces can change so rapidly. How have you\nmanaged to do this with a company where\nsoftware development has been at the core of\nyour business?\nI wouldn't say that's true anymore. It has been\na core theme, but the company is much\nbroader now. It's got a whole range of act iv i ties. I would say that the core behind the company now is innovation. We are an innovation\ncompany, where we combine our understanding of this technology in the future with market\nneeds as they are going to be in the future\nand bring thing this together. We are marketing technology and we use software, design\nand engineering. And we outsource many of\nthese things as well. So the core competency\nis technology marketing.\nYou mentioned that there is a time and a place for certain things in history. Do you\nthink that the fortunes of Psion would have\nbeen greater if you had re-located Psion to the\nWestern United States. Because of the other\nCompanies that are there, which you would\nbe feeding off, and also because of the massive amount of capital that you would be able\nto attract, wouldn't it be a better place to be?\nI don't think that's true today. I don't think that\ncapital is an impediment. There is a pool of\navailability of capital. That could have been a factor twenty years ago - certainly in the early\n80s the availability of capital was very limited.\nI think that the answer to your question is yes,\nand I did contemplate relocating to Silicon\nValley or the San Francisco area. Actually, I spend a lot of time there - that was were it\nkind of came from, because I was living and\nworking in Los Angeles, and I was up in San\nFrancisco a lot of the time, so there is an\ninvolvement there, too. But it is true that if\nPsion had been located there I think that it\nwould have been an easier journey for us to\ntravel.\nOn the other hand, there are very European aspects to consider. There is no reason\ntoday why these things can't be done in\nEurope. There is the infrastructure that's here,\nthere's the capital, there's a lot of very e ducat ed, creative people capable of delivering\nwhat's required - but they don't.I think part of\nthe reason why they don't is because in Europe\nwe are less excited and interested in the\nfuture. There is too much looking back over\nour shoulders. There is too much interest in\nheritage. There are people like Simon Jenkins,\nfor example, who write all over the place and\nlive in an Old Men's Club somewhere and\nlook back at some kind of golden, historic era\nof Victorian England. So there is a lot of that.\nI mean, I myself like to look forward I suppose\nthat is why came into this business. And Americans are terribly excited by the future and creating the future. So yes why aren't there more\nEuropean companies. One of the things I like\nto talk about is trying to encourage the young\nentrepreneurs, young business people, stu-dents, whatever. The opportunities are terrific\n- you just have to go out there and believe\nthat you can do it.\nNow it's an interesting question, this question about Silicon Valley and about location.\nOne of the things that our industry is\nabout is facilitating. Computers, com mu nica tion, the internet and so on is the death of dis-t ance, so I throw it back to you, does it matter\nwhether you're in San Jose or London or\nTaipei, now that the world's kind of collapsed\ninto the global village? I think it does to an\nextent - I only wished that we galvani sed ourselves in Europe to participate in the industries\nof the future. I spend a lot of time persuading\ngovernment - for example, I'm on various government committees trying to encourage this,\nand I sit on the council of Science and Technology, which reports to the Cabinet. I guess\none of the things that I particular care about is\nwhat are the policies and actions - things that\ngovernment can do to facilitate this interest in\nScience and Technology, and the creation of\nnew enterprises rather than the retention of\nold ones.\nFor instance, this summer the Cabinet published it'se commerce report. E commerce is\nan exciting area, where a lot of people can\nsee the potential of the numbers and a lot of\npeople haven't figured out how to make a profit out of it. The current strategy seems to\nbe playing the numbers game. For instance,\nthe company everyone knows is Freeserve. It\nstarted off and after 9 months they had about\na million people registered on their website.\nBut when you sit down and look at the num-be rs, you see that something doesn't quite\nadd up: it had a turnover of 2 million and a loss of 1 million. Yet it was valued at nearly 2\nbillion pounds? Now, your new company Symbian is in this industry, in the sense that is in\nthe communications arena. What are your\nviews on the opportunities?\nI think that Symbian is potentially in one of the\nmost important spaces, by which I mean economic market spaces that are going to evolve.\nAnd that's why there is a lot of interest in it.\nWhat Symbian will facilitate is wireless mobile\naccess to the internet. And it looks like it could\nend up with some of the core software technology that is going to facilitate it. So yes, we\nare always moving and we have to keep moving on. If we stop moving the terms of our perception and thinking and so on then that's bad\nnews.\nPsion has also got very high values and a lot of that can be associated with Symbian.\nWe're valued at something over a billion\npounds - but we are a very different animal\nfrom the likes of Freeserve. We've actually got\na long track record of creating products - sue-15 December 1999 * Felix interview fly\nDollar Doc\nYou wouldn't go far wrong listening to David Potter, the man who has turned his\nFelix managed to get an interview with him just before the recent COMDEX show\nces s ful, profitable and cash flow generating\nproducts. Almost all of our capital, assets and\ncash flow come from retained profits, not from\nflotations raising vast quantities of money.\nNow, I have to express serious doubt about\nthe valuations being put on some of these very\nyoung start-up ventures, often where the business model is unknown. In the case of Symbian, there is core technology which has enormous potential value. Even if it's successful,\nthere are still questions about who will win in\nthat space. Some people think it will be\nMicrosoft. I don't think so, but the game's not\nplayed yet. What it does have is good core\ntechnology to go with a huge customer base\nto deliver that, because of all the cellular\nmobile phone companies. So that's kind of\nreal.\nEverybody is doing a dot com company.\nActually, what I would point out to you is the\nfollowing - this demonstrates that the economic system is very healthy. And I 'll tell you\nwhy - it's only fairly recently (over the past few\nyears) that the investing institutions, fund man-a gers, pension companies, and insurance\ncompanies (who have to think in the long-term\nin terms of financial assets) suddenly began to\nwake up and realise that the internet, not to\nmention technology as a whole, was going to\nplay a very important role in the future economy of the world.\nSo, the trustees and fund managers and\ninstitutions developed policy saying that this is\ngoing to become huge. We have to invest in\nit. It has to be part of our portfolio. And we\ntherefore need our portfolio to have x percent\ninvolved in high technology and internet\nstocks. So they then said to their fund managers 'go out and make that happen'. The\nfund managers went out, looked for the stuff\nand they couldn't find enough of it. Now some\nof the first laws of economics tell you that if\nthere is very high demand for something and\nnot enough supply the price goes up. So what\nyou have is absurdly high pricing of all manner of potential companies in that area.\nWhich of course is totally unfounded. It's daft,\nand a lot of money is going to be lost there.\nHowever, think about it from an economic\npoint of view. By putting the price of these\npotential investments so high, it's attracting\nresources - people, money, capital, development staff, management, etc - into those very\nareas to develop that industry. And so the economic system is just doing it's job. Unfortunately, a lot of investors are going to lose a lot\nof money in about two years time (or when ev er), when the supply of new e commerce companies and investments swamps demand. And\nthen I leave it to you to figure out what is\ngoing to happen, the price is going to fall and\nyou can then begin to get a balance over a period of time. This is actually what is going\non. The valuations of some of these investments is absurd. With these new one and two\nyear start-ups, there is no knowledge as to\nwhether they have a business model or not.\nAnd so a lot of money is going to be lost - but\nsome of those companies will succeed.\nWhat are your views on the transfer between\nuniversities and start-up companies? It seems\nmuch better now than it was at the time you\nwere at Imperial. So in fact there are no real\nbarriers anymore - the infrastructure,\nresources, capital, and people are available.\nSo, do people just need to have the drive, if\nthey actually believe that there business idea\nhas the potential?\nI think that is correct and I think that these are\ncultural attitudes. More and more people are\nkind of interested and they do want to participate in this new world. Of course, it's not just\ninformation technology - if you take biotechnology there are huge opportunities there,\nand the same is true in many other areas. So\nyes, I think that the universities are striving for\nbetter practice, and some of them are succeeding well - and others are fudd y dud dy and slow.\nNow there are three areas that I would\ncriticise in the university environment. One is\nthat universities can be very slow to respond to\nemployment needs and to new disciplines. So\nwe don't have anything like the number of\ndepartments and resources and staff required\nto train people in software, for example. It's a huge area, and it's very exciting. There are\nnew ideas about information and artificial\nintelligence and the brain, both human and\nartificial, and it's psychology. There's a whole\nbunch of areas that are coming together and\nwe are very backward - our universities\nrespond very slowly to external demands and I think that's a fundamental problem.\nThe second problem with our universities\nis that we have got an increasingly unitary s ys tem. By unitary I mean a single type of institution that has been created. That's very bad.\nWe need diversity among our institutions,\ninstead of all of them copying each other.\nThe third element which I would say is\nthere as well is that there can be, there has\nbeen historically, a division in British culture\nbetween what I 'll call 'pure science' and app li cation. There is a prejudice against the ideas\nand applications of men and women in sci-en ce. As opposed to God's ideas...\nSuch as the basic laws of physics?\nThere is an attitude there which says that the\npursuit of science for it's own sake is good. Yet\nthe pursuit of the application of science and\ntechnology is somehow bad. We don't value it\nin the same way as Americans do. Engineering\ndisciplines, applications of whatever kind,\nsoftware...these are considered lesser kind of\nsubjects. And I illustrate that by saying that the\nscience lobby in Britain is enormously strong\nand has great influence. But we don't have\nproper institutions, or any kind of lobby, in\napplications and technology, and we are very\nweak. And that's what differs between us and\nthe America.\nDo you have an example of that kind of lobby\nin America?\nWell it's everywhere. You've got to kind of look\nat the infrastructure. The influence of the\nsemiconductor manufacturers on the universities and on government is substantial.\nIndeed, when faced with a crisis from the\nJapanese 1 0 or 1 2 years ago, there was great\nsupport from the government. Look at MIT\nand it's Media Lab and all that's going on.\nThat is another example where people are\nreally interested... I mean MIT is one of the\ngreat universities of the world, so is Stanford.\nAnd they are massively involved in these new\ndisciplines. It's difficult to find many British\nuniversities who are... There's nothing equivalent to the likes of MIT or, for that matter,\nAusten, Texas. So it's just not networked\nthrough the universities and government and\nbusiness in the same kind of way. It's a cultural issue.\n\n"

    "content": "42 Christmas TV Guide Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nThe Felix Essential\nDavid Roberts examines the highlights (and the turkeys)\nW ell, where do I start? It's two weeks to Christmas, I 've got stack of\nresearch material in front of mf\nanswer to what is always the mo\nof year - is there any decent TV on over CA rapid perusal of my primary source\n(the perfect combo of Radio Times, V Times and What's on TV) shows that, some\nwhat un surprisingly, the schedules an\nalmost identical to last year, complete wit l Christmas special's from every high-rate c show, wall-to-wall movies (of wildly vary in; quality) and not a hint of religious broad\ncasting. The one big change from th t norm is on New Year's Eve, when the\nseem to be making a concerted effort to\nblow the entirety of next year's licence fee\nin one fell swoop, whilst ITV wheel out\nthe celebrities in an attempt to hang onto\nsome credibility after their eclipse fiasco.\nBut back to the beginning. Christmas\nTV is primarily about one thing - movies.\nThis year offers up a massive selection,\nbut sadly the usual strong point( big\nname premiers) is worrying ly absent.\nBBC1 offers up underrated Tom Cruise\naction er Mission Impossible [9pm, Boxing Day], lame Denzel Washington vehicle\nCourage Under Fire [9pm, Tuesday 27th] and the\namazing Heat [9pm, Tuesday 21st], and BBC2\nthrows in the (dangerously arty) Italian awards-fest\nII Postino [8.30pm, Christmas Day], ITV, as far as I can see, doesn't have anything to offer at all on the\npremier front.\nHowever, with Sky's movie channels now showing every film on the planet years before they hit\nterrestrial TV (I can't even be bothered to run\nthrough the list of amazing flicks that are available\nvia satellite over the festive period), the standard of\nmovies is far more important than their vintage -and as a result BBC2 hammer BBC1, ITV and\nChannel Four squarely into touch. On Christmas\nEve, they line up Some Like It Hot\n[6.10pm], Clueless [10.15pm] and the\noriginal Cape Fear [11.50pm]. Of these,\nthe first is undoubtedly the best - Marilyn\nMonroe's entire reputation and iconic status for the rest of the century has been bu i on her appearance here, and it's also Tony\nCurtis and Jack Lemmon's finest hour - but\nall three knock spots off anything on either\nof the main channels over the festive sea-son.\nNot content with one evening of fine\nmovies, however, they follow it up with a simply outstanding schedule of classic\nmovies on Christmas Day itself. Indeed, the daytime schedule looks like it\nhas been put together by my mum, with Gene Kelly's ground breaking\nmusical An American In Paris [8.05am], the extraordinarily cheesy Bing\nCrosby vehicle White Christmas [3.15pm] and one of the greatest movies of all time,\nSingin' in the Rain [5.10pm], all slotting\nthemselves in nicely around presents and\nfood. Then, as if that wasn't enough, the film\ngeeks paradise continues with II Postino\n[8.30pm] arguably one of the best foreign\nlanguage films of the nineties - and Citizen\nKane [11.45pm] rounding off the day. And\nwhilst, admittedly, much of this can hardly\ne viewing (with the obvious exception of White\nien any of these movies before, they're definitely worth watching whilst you try to\nwork off the inevitable feeling of\nbloated ness. If, however, you don't share my\npassion for classic forties and fifties\ncinema, there is another option. The\ntrue point of Christmas is catching up\non childhood, and fortunately there\nare plenty of opportunities to do so\nthis year. Amongst the most obvious\nfilms that spring to eye are Disney'si[5.30p m, New Year's Eve, BBC2], the impe c ly lame-but-enjoyable The Goonies [3.20pm, ik Holiday Monday, ITV] and, one of my childhood fave s, Willy Wonker and the Chocolate Factory. And whilst it's not entirely in the same cate-gory, Muppet Treasure Island [1.50, December\n28th, BBC1] also embodies the same degree of\nchildish stupidity, and is definitely worth a watch.\nAlternatively, there are some great kitsch seasons on Channel 4 (as ever), first amongst which\nis the chance to see every original\nGodzilla movie ever made, and come\nto terms with the amazingly sharp contrast between these man-in-a suit classics and the travesty that was the ultra-budget Hollywood version. Godzilla\n[1.05am] and Godzilla Rides Again\n[3.05am] kick the set off on Christmas\nEve, and the series continues for the\nnext week, peaking out with Godzilla vs\nMothra [1 .55am] on Bank Holiday\nMonday. The cult value of this piece can\nbe instantly recognised from its Radio\nTimes listing alone - \"Horror adventure.\nAfter surviving a battle with King Kong,\n_ Mothra the giant moth goes to the aid of\n\u2022 the Peanut Sisters. Japanese with English\nsubtitles.\" Class.\nThere is, however, more to Christmas\nthan movies. No, I'm not talking about\nreligion, I'm talking about Christmas Specials. The relative worth of a variety of\ncompeting series can always be gauged\nby the placing and length of their Crimble\none-offs - if your special is on December\n15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Christmas TV Guide 43\nChristmas TV Guide\nof this year's Christmas and New Year television output\n20th, you know that you're definitely B List.\nHorses finally a thing of the past, the Ch\nagain up for grabs. Realising their ob vio u: have chosen to give the prime slots over to\nThe Vicar of Dibley, which airs four times\nover the holidays (on Christmas Eve,\nChristmas Day, Bank Holiday Monday and\nNew Years Day) - which may or may not\nturn out to be a good idea... The Royle\nFamily [10.30pm] and They Think It's All\nOver [1 1,10pm] are the other winners in\nthe scrap for the Christmas Evening slots,\nwhilst Christmas Eve offers the much more\nterrifying prospect of Dale Winton and that\nannoying camp blok e from Airport on the\nsame schedule, with Winton's Wonderland (10.35pm) and the Airport Christmas Special [8.30pm] topping the bill.\nGulp. Oh, and (as ever) the seasonal\nCasualty special [8pm, Boxing Day,\nBBC1] promises a mix of Santa's with\nbroken legs, miraculous recoveries and\ndubious doctor-nurse relationships.\nSo how does ITV intend on countering this challenge? Well, they too have\ngone for their strengths - in this case the\nability to throw truck-loads of cash\naround. So, prepare yourself for the infuriatingly gripping must-see TV that\nis Chris Tarrant setting new records for annoyance three times in one night\nwith Who Wants To Be A Christmas Millionaire [6pm,8.30 pm,10.30 pm] splattered across the Christmas Day schedule. If\nsomeone doesn't win the million this time around,\nI 'll be very, very surprised... On a( slightly) more\nhighbrow note, there's also the regulation ITV\ndrama's, with A Touch Of Frost [9pm, Christmas\nDay] winning the prime slot ahead of Heartbeat\n[8pm, Boxing Day] and The Bill [8pm, Christmas\nEve].\nHowever, looking five inches to the left in my\nRadio Times (I have, by this stage, abandoned the\nother two listings magazines as utterly inferior publications) suggests that ITV are\ngoing to be blown out of the water across\nthe board in this year's ratings battle. The\nmain problem is that, no matter how much\ncash ITV wheel out, they're never going to\nbe able to match up to the financial might\nof the BBC Costume Drama department -and consequently, the BBC's two part adaptation of David Copperfield [7pm, Christmas Day & 6.25pm, Boxing Day] will blow\nthe puny opposition out of the water. As\never, ITV might win the ratings war for 90%\nof the year, but when it comes to holidays\nand special occasions, the BBC always\ncomes up smelling of roses...\nThere are, of course, five freely available terrestrial chi\nit's only fair to briefly assess what the rest are up to. Well\ner, every channel is (sensibly) playing\nto its strengths. Thus, BBC2 goes for\nclassic movies, classical music (Cecil\nand Bryn at Glyndebourne [6.50pm, Christmas Day] ), opera (Falstaff\n[7.30pm, December 22] ), and documentaries (Arena [9pm Christmas\nEve, Boxing Day and Bank Holiday\nMonday]). Channel 4, similarly, know\ntheir place, and thus focus their energies on being off-beat. In the lead, as\never, comes their alternative Christmas Message, which, this time\naround, is to be issued by Ali G so\nexpect a few more reference to\np unani then you'd usually find in the\nQueen's Christmas Message.. .Aside\nfrom that, they can offer shed loads\nof quality documentaries and cult TV,\nand a few decent films. Finally, there's, who, to be honest, seem to have\ngiven up already. Their usual repertoire of bad\nmovies, soft porn, bad quiz shows, and, of course,\nNight Fever [7pm, Christmas Day] is in place, and\nindeed they seem to be hanging much of their\nCrimble schedule around Suggs. Quality.\nFinally, we come to the Millennium itself.\nDespite the endless stream of parties, massive all-night ers, burning rivers, etc, etc that we're all\nbeing plagued with at the moment, the big TV\ncompanies seem to have taken the decision that\nwhat we're actually going to want to do for the big\nnight is stay in and watch it all on television.\nWhilst this is probably the case for many of our\nparents, I hope it won't hold true for very\nmany of us, so I won't dwell on this section for too long.\nAs ever, the BBC seem to hold all\nthe trump cards. Although the concept\nof sitting through twenty-seven hours of\nnon-stopping programming, watching\nthe new millennium dawn around the\nworld, hardly sounds app et ising, the\nsimple fact that they seem to have hired\ntheir entire star roster and have live link-ups\nto every spot on the planet will probably\nmake for moderately entertaining viewing\nwell, apart from the links to the Archbishop\nof Canterbury and the Pope). Meanwhile,\nITV have brought in their \"serious\" faces in\nan effort to lend the proceedings some grav-itas - that's right, they've hired Trevor\nMcDonald. No contest - there's not even the\nusual choice of Angus Deyton, Clive James\nand Jools Holland....oh, but there is Suggs\nagain, this time with three hours of Night\nFever. I'm outta here - merry Christmas, and\na happy new year.\n\n"

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Music 29\nf re que Rutin'\n\u00a9Ministry of Sound\nMinistry is probably the most well known club in London (well known for the music, well known\nfor the sound system, well known because it's well known). The question is whether it lives up\nto its reputation. Once you're passed security you enter a red-lit corridor with the music pumping at the other end of the tunnel. As soon as you're in you follow your ears to the main dance\nfloor on the left, which is the heart of the Ministry. You can't help but give in to the stunning\nsound quality of the American House tunes mixed to perfection by resident DJs Jazzy M and\nErick Morillo or the other top guest DJs. All tastes are catered for depending on the night you\ngo and with six massive speakers strategically placed in the main, it doesn't matter where you\nhappen to find yourself dancing.\nLast Saturday was no exception. Jules Papp kicked off with a3 hour set with an increasingly\nhigh tempo throughout, although there could have been more variation. Towards 3am the\ncrowd was getting really big, the venue really packed. Clubbers could be spotted everywhere\nwith shirts undone and water bottles in their hands, absorbing the music. Then Tim Deluxe came\non and continued in the right direction by increasing the beats and the volume. The next three\nhours consisted of the definition of deep house with his special effects flying all over the place.\nFinally Jazzy M finished the night off with yet another three hour set consisting of more relaxed\ntunes.\nWhen you needed to chill out, you could either go into the main bar where the music is softer\nand slower, or into the small bar and have a drink (having said that drinks are predictably\nexpensive, water is \u00a31.90). Then again, if you're lucky enough to get yourself into the VIP bar\nthen that's definitely the best option. Not only does it have its own cloakroom and toilets for its\nVIPs, but best of all it has an entrance to a small section way above the dance floor. From there\nyou can enjoy the music even more while having the privilege to see your favourite DJ mastering the decks.\nDeep House was not the only thing available. In the Main Bar softer more commercial house\nwas being played, but this did not stop people from dancing on the bar. Right at the end you\nhad the Smartie Party where another mixer and the live percussionist merged the tunes into wild\nfrenzy of body shaking beats. The lighting effects on all three dance floors were average to say\nthe least. But the stage dancers definitely made up for it (especially if you had the chance to\nsee them warming up from the VIP bar).\nI recommend getting there before half past eleven and waiting for % of an hour (to avoid the\nmassive queues), so by the time you get in you will be able to have a good look at what you\nlike. The dress code is a lot less strict than I thought - loads of people had black trainers on\nbut if you want to be on the safe side then wear something smart and casual.\nNot even the \u00a315 entrance fee is a good excuse not to have visited MoS at least once on Rutin'\nSaturday. If you fall in love with the place, a membership is \u00a340 and that includes an album,\nfree entry to five select club nights, reduced entry on all nights, the chance to skip the queue\nand some other random offers.\nHenry\nMillennium\nClubbing\nThe 31 st of December 1 999 sees the clubs of England charging what might at first seem ridiculous\namounts of cash. However, if you've got a spare\nhundred quid lying around you could do a lot\nworse. Remember to account for consumables\nwhen wallet stuffing though!\nFriday 31st December 1999\nMinistry of Sound; \u00a3130\nThe most well known and expensive of the lot the\nMinistry has its usual line up of top DJs. Your ticket gets you free champagne on entry and a gift\npack when you leave with an opportunity to win a trip to Ibiza in the summer.\nFabric; \u00a399\nBasement Jaxx, the Scratch Perverts and the\nFreestylers play at this top venue. With doors open\nfrom 8pm until 8am and some 'special surprises'\nyou cannot go far wrong with this.\nHome; \u00a399\nWith Home shortly to become a household name\nthis night has to be good. Paul Oakenfold plays\nlive on Radio 1 and Carl Cox plays live from Sydney. The ticket does not include any free drinks but\nthey promise that prices will not be raised for the\noccasion.\nGatecrasher; \u00a3107.50\nAn extravaganza unlike any other with 25,000\npeople in the largest ever portable structure and\nthe likes of the Chemical Brothers, Sasha and\nJudge Jules doing their stuff.\nSlinky; \u00a365\nBournemouth's finest hosts 16 hours of overpaid\nDJs on ISDN links getting paid several times over\nfor doing the same as usual.\nRenaissance; \u00a3110\nHeld in 18th century Italian gardens, this night at\nleast has some originality with some exclusive DJs\nin the form of Dave Seaman and John Digweed.\nCream; \u00a399\nHeld in London at the Brixton Academy and in\nCardiff at the Wales National Ice Rink as well as\nthe original Liverpool venue this features Fatboy\nSlim, Pete Tong and Sasha - again.\n\n"

    "content": "46 Clubs & Societies Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nOutdoor Club\nSTEVE JOLLY\nSawrey's a very long way from IC,\nbut it has showers, a piano and\nnearby mountains, so we went\nthere anyway. After a leisurely six-hour drive up the M6, we arrived\nat about lam and sprawled in\nheaps all over the floor. Awakened on Saturday by the welcome\nsmell of breakfast, we decided to\nsplit into two groups: the more\nexperienced members to find a grade three scramble up St Sunday Crag in Patterdale; the others\n(ably led by Pudding Officer Mallet) to stroll (stride?) along Striding Edge and up Helvellyn.\nTaking a shortcut, the scramblers ably wheezed up about a thousand feet of 45 degree grass\nto the actual craggy bit of the hill.\nEasily negotiating the incompetent fools making up other parties\nthey soloed their way to the top in\nan irritatingly short (but amusing)\ntwenty minutes, delayed only by\nSteve and Jeremy's( successful)\nroped attempt to haul themselves\nup a Severe pitch just off the\nroute. The number of other parties around made traditional\nclimbing calls between leader and\nsecond ambiguous, so they pioneered the use of (extremely) random quotes from Round songs:\ncries of \"I like bananas because\nthey have no bones\" and \"Potato\nWaffles\" echoed around Patte r dale. Meanwhile, the strider s were\nbeing hauled inexorably at breakneck pace along Striding Edge by\nMallet (this is the man whose idea\nof a little run involves thirty miles\nand ten major peaks...). Reaching\nthe top of Helvellyn in record\ntime, and undeterred by a horizontal hail-storm (and, he claims,\nflying fish fingers), the long-suffer-ing other members of the party\nwere persuaded to just wander\ndown Glenridding and then up to\nStick's Pass and then...\nBack at the hut that night,\nMallet put on his Pudding Officer's hat and sprang into action.\nIn less than no time a six-course\nmeal for twice the number of people on the trip was on the table\n(really - I'd list them, but there\nwere too many). An hour later, the\nsix-course meal was still on the\ntable, club members having spent\nthe intervening time alternately\neating, rolling around the floor\nmoaning (generally about the\nseafood in the pa ella) and making remarks along the lines of\n\"Never again!\" and \"OK, this is\ngetting ****ing stupid.\" That\ndone, we all pissed off down the\npub to throw darts at each other.\nSunday morning. Six professional maniacs jumped at the\nchance to indulge their Neoprene\nfetishes by donning wetsuits and\nclimbing into canoes; the rest\ntook a car over to Coniston to do\nsome more scrambling. After a half hour drive and half an hour\nworking out how to put the\ncanoes together in the pouring\nrain, the canoeists found the right\nriver and paddled away down-stream. After an uneventful trip\nacross Rydal Water, we had three\nmiles of flooded river, white\nwater, low branches and our own\nlack of skill to negotiate. Casualties: minor branch-induced bruises all round, two rubber mallets,\none hat, and a nice ninety degree\nbend in the supporting poles of\none of the canoes (hitting things\nhead on at full speed is bad,\nJeremy). Reaching Windermere\njust as the weather got bad\nenough to stop the ferries, we\nwent across to a nearby bank for\nlunch and a piss. We then had to\ndecide how to get back to the\nminibus, left five miles upstream.\nEventually, half of us paddled\nback over to Ambleside and Andy\nlegged it from there.\nThe weekend's fun was far\nfrom over, mind you.

The half hour long\nperformance attracted comments\nranging from 'Excellent - this choir\ncan really sing' to 'could we have\nthis every week'. Despite there\nbeing only ten singers, the choir\nprojected well, whilst each of the\nvoice parts blended together.\nsped to the rescue in the van, and\nDamo, Ian and the car went home\non the back of a breakdown truck.\nDo you like cheese?

The\nconcert took place in the same\nweek as that of the Imperial College Symphony Orchestra, in\nwhich many of the singers already\nplay. The choir already has firm\nplans to record their first CD in\nFebruary, has a number of other\nhigh-profile performances lined-up over the coming weeks, and\nalso hopes to sing at both functions and receptions.\nTheir well-received debut will\nbe followed up by a performance\nof Christmas carols in the BMS\nfoyer on the last day of term, Friday 17th December, at 1pm.

    "content": "Arts Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nmethod A Dirk Mds\nICU Dramsoc\n\u00a34\nUnion Concert Hall (Finished)\nDirk, based on Douglas Adams1\nDirk\nGently's Holistic Detective Agency, is\na somewhat bizarre, occasionally\nrandom, but fundamentally interconnected play.\nThe plot is... interesting, with several plotlines coming together with\nsome force at the finale, but is basically a murder mystery with more\ntwists than might be expected. There\nare a few departures from the book,\nbut, with the exception of the near-unforgivable omission of the Electric\nMonk, they're fairly cosmetic.\nThe acting is excellent, with Andrew\nProwse playing Dirk with all the self-assured eccentricity he deserves.\nPaul Smith's Michael is an impressive villain, quoting Coleridge and\nbrandishing a crossbow like a man\npossessed. The fragmented nature\nof the plot does tend to leave the\naudience a little perplexed, but then\nRichard, the other main character,\nspends most of the play in a state of\nsome confusion. Joe Wakeling\nlends him an air of upper class\nbewilderment - think Hugh Grant in\na Hunter S Thompson novel.\nThe effective staging and confident\nproduction make this an impressive\nperformance of a potentially challenging play. Extra marks are\ndeserved for the cheesy Americanised recap of the first act and the\ninspired (if mad) Schrodinger's Cat\nscene. Nice one.\nGarefh\nEtcetera Theatre\n\u00a35 cone.\nNearest Tube: Camden Town\nThe Etcetera Theatre is a tiny little affair above a pub in the middle of Camden. I estimate that a \"full house\" would comprise maybe 20 people, if\nthey were all good friends and didn't mind being jammed up against each\nother. But don't let this put you off - despite the fact that the actors perform\nabout two metres away from you, they have perfected that middle-distance\nstare, as if they were performing to an audience spread through some\ncathedral-like auditorium. In other words, it is intimate but not too intimate.\nThe play involves four main characters, all Londoners, immersed in their\nown particular daydreams. There are only four actors, and as they play the\nmain characters as well as the various supporting roles, it can be a bit confusing as to what's actually going on at times. This is compounded by a minimal multi-purpose set, but it just means you have to pay a little more\nattention. The short scenes take us through one day and one night of the\ncharacter's lives and the worlds they inhabit when their minds start to wan-der. There is Nathan, who feels terribly lonely and is obsessed with the story\nof a man who was trapped in an Antarctic weather station for many months\nand successfully managed to overcome his loneliness. There is \"Jason\", a checkout girl at Iceland. She seems to be in a world of her own anyway,\nbut when she does start to fanta s is e she dreams of meeting Eskimos, dressing snugly, closeness and feeling loved. The third character is Annie, a girl\nwho wants to fly away from it all. She wants to be single and dreams of flying away to the North Pole in a balloon. The final character is Nicholas, a poor man with romantic dreams of being a Russian revolutionary. All of the\ncharacter's paths cross only briefly throughout the piece, but their dreams\nare united by the theme of snow.\nEven though it is nothing groundbreaking, the play is charming, thought-provoking, and funny, and should be judged in the context of the whole\nexperience. The pub above which the theatre is located, the Oxford Arms,\nis a very authentic and agreeable little venue. It has all the attributes that\na good pub should have: atmosphere, grimy toilets, English-speaking bar\nstaff and pissed locals plying you with cigarettes whilst telling you about\ntheir brother Colin who was the middle-weight boxing champion in 1 962.\nAdditionally, the cast of the play hang around the bar afterwards, so you\ncan ask them to clarify any bits of the plot that you were unsure about.\nAll in all, are commendable little evening. Especially if you want a bit of\nvariety in your life.\nCaspar\nBloomsbury Theatre\n\u00a33.00\nDecember every Year. (Finished)\nThis is what a student review ought\nto be like - it was funny and fun.\nThe UCL medics drama society -known as MDs (Manic Depressives) - get up on stage and\ndance, sing, generally piss about,\nand shamelessly pla gia rise. With a much better script than is generally expected at reviews - mostly\nwritten by one Mark Lewis - the\ncast rose to the challenge (yep,\nthere are loads of jokes like that).\nThere was a huge number of\nridiculous characters including\nRobin Hood, Maid Marion, Friar\nSchmuck (you dirty boy you), loads\nof very evil / mad people and the\nKing himself - in his many guises.\nMDs produces the same kind of\nChristmas fun and frolics every\nyear to raise money for Middlesex\nHospital. If you are expecting\nsome high drama or something\nthat is suitable for the kids then\nyou're bound to feel that you\nmade a mistake. But the acting\nwas good enough to carry the\njokes to those in the audience not\nmates with half the cast, and there\nwere hardly any \"in\" jokes only\nfathomable to medics. It was a good Stephi (rhyming slang)-always high spirited and at times\nflashes or real quality (and\nbreasts).\nYou've missed it this year but Mds\nare back every year and they're\nwell supported and well worth it.\nBen\n\n"

If you would like to help\nnext term, then make a resolution to see\ntheatre and galleries for free in the new year\n- all you have to do is write what you\nthought of it. We meet every Friday at\n1 .00pm in the Felix office. Alternatively,\nemail benjamin.fisher@ic.ac.uk.\nCareful, 007! All this blinding Bondery seems\njust a little out of place in such a small and\nsedate gallery as The Serpentine. This is a fine\nart gallery, yet it is difficult to see 007, M, Q, SPECTRE and chums as fine art! This exhibition\nwould surely be more at home in the Museum of\nthe Moving Image (MOMI) on the South Bank.\nWhile techno-sets are his first love (he was an\nRAF fighter pilot in WW2 and is a self-confessed\naeroplane fanatic), he is also a master of lower\noctane thrills. He did the East European prison\ncum West London warehouse in The Ipcress File\nand the sets in Sleuth (1972) and, more recent-ly, The Madness of King George (1995). His latest design project is for the Millennium Celebrations in the city of his birth, Berlin.\nHappy Christmas!\nBen\nSerpentine Gallery\nUntil 9 January 2000\nFree admission\nThe name's Adam. Ken Adam. Ken Adam, the\nlatest artist exhibiting at The Serpentine was the\nreal-life Q. He was the production designer\nbehind the Bond films and all those other self-consciously hip flicks of the 1960s. From his\noriginal sketches of the sets through to photographs through to excerpts of the films them-selves, we see his work for Dr Sfrange/ove\n(1963), The-Ipcress File (1965) and numerous\nBonds (Dr No, Goldfinger, Thunderbolt). Without\ndoubt, Adam helped capture that entirely mythical 1960s Zeitgeist of style over substance on\ncelluloid. In the cinema, Q took all the credit for\nthe Aston Martin DB5 with eject or seats, but in\nreality we must thank the imagination of Ken\nAdam.\nKen Adam invented the concept of the Bond\nbaddie's giant HQ, and then took it to new\nheights of silliness, eventually going into orbit\nwith Moonraker (1979). All this makes you\nrealise just how much the success of the 007\nfilms depended on the unsung Ken. Without him,\nthey would all have ended up as rather dreary\nstories of a pre historically sexist contract killer.\nAs the new century dawns, we have a lot of great\ncinematic moments to thank Ken Adams for. Just\nthink of that endless round of Bond movies no\ndoubt due to be pumped out this Christmas! But\nthe question is: can an exhibition of still pictures\never do justice to his moving pictures? The\nanswer is simple: no.\nWilliam Burns\n\n"

But was\nit worth the wait? Does it live up to expectations?\nThe answer has to be a resounding YES. Gearbox, the developers, have\nkept everything that was good about the original, and added so much new\nstuff that the mind boggles.\nThis time round you're on the side of the soldiers from Half Life, battling\nthe aliens that are pouring through the dimensional rift opened in the first\ngame. The storyline and scripted sequences are well up to the exceptional\nstandards set by Valve. The best part by far, however, has to be the new ene-mies. From the dart spitting aliens with metre long claws, to the infuriatingly\nintelligent Black Ops soldiers, every creature looks just right and is a real bastard to kill.\nThis expansion pack is nearly as big and complex as some complete\ngames, and the attention to detail is incredible - just watch the intro sequence\nand you'll see what I mean. If you own Half Life then go out and buy Opposing Force now. If not, well, then buy Half Life at the same time.\nBen\nMS Flight Simulator 2000 (PC)\nFS2000 is civil aviation flight sim of epic proportions, with maps of pretty\nmuch anywhere in the world and aircraft from the ancient Sopwith Camel to\nConcorde. The 2000 edition is bigger and more detailed than the 98 ver-sion, and if you are a serious flight fanatic or looking to practice for a private\npilot's license then this is an excellent product.\nThe graphics are greatly improved over the 98 edition, as long as you have\na ninja PC to play it on. There are loads of graphical glitches and loading\npauses however - but then this is a Microsoft product.\nThe important thing about this game is that it does give a sense of actually flying, unlike some flight sims on the market. With the huge amount of content in the game you can do whatever you want, from aerobatics to instrument landings. There really is no better civil flight simulator on the market.\nreact\u00a9\nTurok: Rage Wars (N64)\nRage Wars is essentially a multi-player game only. There isn't really the comprehensive one-player 'Quest' mode that we are so accustomed to in 3D shooters. Gone are the maze-like levels, single-life monsters, and non-replenish able ammo dumps. Say he ilo to custom-built combat arenas,\ninstant resurrection and reappearing ammo.\nRage Wars premiers the use of computer bots in a console 1st person\nshooter, and it works a treat. Lets be honest, playing 2-player Go/den eye ain't that much fun, since there's no chance of you creeping up unawares on\nyour opponent. Rage Wars adds that essential tenseness by creating up to\nthree bots to come and play. Its clever Al, with the bots actively seeking out\nthe power-ups as well as their opponents.\nRage Wars is the finest console multi-player shooter I 've played, with many\ndifferent game styles to choose from. Graphics and sound are good; instead\nthe game falters on the lack of a true single player-game. Consoles just\ncan't compete with PCs when it comes to 3D blasters, and you'll find that\neven the likes of the ageing Quake 2 are still streets ahead of this.\nViv\nArmageddon's Blade (PC)\nThis is the expansion pack for the brilliant Heroes of Might & Magic 3 (one of\nthe best strategy games around). For the ignorant out there, Heroes of Might\nand Magic is a strategic turn based game in a fantasy world (cue Goblins,\nDragons, Elves and all things magical). You control a hero who has to raise\nan army to defeat the opposition castle or vanquish some terrible monster.\nThe game is highly addictive and easy to pick up. The interface is simplicity itself and the graphics and music are pretty good too. There are six new\ncampaigns, which are pretty challenging (or at least I find them quite hard)\nand will have you playing for hours on end. If you like Heroes of Might and\nMagic 3 then this expansion pack is well worth the money, especially the challenging campaigns. Like Heroes of Might and Magic 3, love Armageddon's Blade.\nBen Mark\n\n"

The problem is that superhero wannabes are exactly what they\nare. They have no extraordinary powers of their own. The team\nincludes Ben Stiller as Mr Furious, who gets bad when he gets mad;\nWilliam H Macy as The Shoveler, whose power is, you guessed it,\nusing his shovel to batter people senseless; and Hank Azaria as The\nBlue Raja, who throws silverware with deadly accuracy. Therefore,\nwhen supervillain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), kidnaps\nCaptain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), the only real superhero in Champion City, the Mystery Men have to come forth and produce the goods.\nAlong the way, they are able to enlist the services of 4 more 'super-heroes' (played by Janeane Garofolo, Kel Mitchell, Paul Reubens, and\nWes Studi) of which Paul Reubens, as The Spleen, is most impressive,\nutilising his powers of lethal flatulence.\nMystery Men seems to be a movie that looks better on paper than on\nthe screen. There must have been some mishap that occurred when\nthe script was passed from the screenwriter to the director. The first\ntime director of this movie is Kinka Usher, who has previously helm ed music videos and TV advertisements, and it shows in his hyper-kinetic\nstyle of directing and attention to visuals rather than to the story.\nThat's not to say that there isn't anything to like in the movie. On the\ncontrary, the script provides many laugh-out-loud moments, which are\ndelivered well by all the actors involved. Ben Stiller, William H Macy\nand Janeane Garofolo are standouts, as is Paul Reubens (of Pee Wee\nHerman fame). William H Macy is fast becoming one of the best character actors in Hollywood and Janeane Garofalo is always a joy to\nwatch. Unfortunately, however, Eddie Izzard is woefully underused in\nan evil henchman role, as is Claire Forlani (who was last seen, in\nMeet Joe Black) as the love interest.\nAt 120 minutes, Mystery Men seems a bit too long to hold everyone's interest and the 20-minute finale is typical of a$70 million studio\nfilm, where every penny has to be shown on the screen. Which is a shame. A more down-to-earth ending would probably have been\nmore befitting to the movie, but who's going to argue with a big Hollywood producer? All in all, an enjoyable enough movie to watch\nwhere the minimum number of brain cells need to be used.\nThis is one of those bizarre French films that meander from scene to\nscene until they eventually (and un predictably) end. The acting is mostly extremely good but it is let down by the directorial style of Andre\nTechine.\nJuliet Binoche (The English Patient) plays Alice, with such conviction\nthat her ability to interpret difficult roles shines through. Unfortunately, Alexis Loret's screen debut as Martin is not so impressive. His confusion and anguish comes across as merely moody. Many of the smaller roles offer more than the main ones in way of be liev ability. One\nsuch role is Benjamin's. Played by Mathieu Amalric, Benjamin is a struggling, homosexual actor who is more or less disowned by his fam-i ly. Ten year old Martin, the son of an extramarital affair, is persuaded by\nhis mother to live with his father's family. After his father's death ten\nyears later, Martin is distraught and disappears for months. He eventually reappears in Paris at the apartment of his half-brother Benjamin.\nHere he meets Alice, his brother's flat mate, and immediately becomes\nfascinated with her. Martin begins a career in modelling and after\nsome success moves out of the apartment into a nearby hotel. Soon\nAlice overcomes her initial hesitancy and falls in love with Martin. She\nmoves out of the apartment and into Martin's hotel. However, when\nAlice becomes pregnant Martin falls into a coma with shock (who\nwouldn't?). Alice has to fight for his sanity as the truth about his father's death comes out. The end is generally very depressing as Alice ends\nup alone and pregnant, and Martin moves between a mental institution and jail.\nThe detached style of the film makes it hard to emp a this e with the\ncharacters, and the rapid personality changes seem random. There\nare also too many short sequences that add nothing to the general\nstory. On the up side, this film has been released in French with English subtitles, rather than dubbed into English. I can only imagine how\nmuch worse it would have been with uncoordinated, monotonous\nvoices as well.\nIf you are an avid French film fan it might be worth you popping down\nto Cine Lumiere to see this film as overall it is technically a good film\nthat just lacks soul.\nImran Katherine\n\n"

    "content": "Big Issue Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nConstituent College Unions\nThe history of Imperial is inextricably linked to the existence\nof the Constituent Colleges from which it was created.\nAccording to Richard Taylor, they represent our greatest\nasset - but an asset we're in danger of losing very soon...\n\\J) IRIGEJ\nO ne of Imperial College's greatest\nassets could be lost within the next\nfew years unless students act now to\nsave them. Constituent colleges are something\nthat no other university has, and they have\nplayed a vital role in making Imperial College\nthe fantastic modern centre of academic excellence that it is today. It is not without solid\nfoundations that, in the ninety years since it\nwas formed, Imperial has risen to become a name recognised and respected throughout\nthe world in the fields of science and techno lo gy. It is through the constituent colleges and\nthe traditions that are kept alive\nby the students of their\nrespective unions that Imperial maintains its links with the\nformidable history of science\nin the Capital. It is these\nunions which I believe are in\ndanger of disappearing.\nYou do not have to look\nvery far to find a plethora of\nexamples of how the CCUs\nenhance the lives of their stu-dents. City & Guilds and the\nRoyal School Mines do a brilliant job of maintaining connections with both their graduates\nand relevant industries. The fact that the RSM\nAssociation is the acknowledged benchmark\nfor excellence around the world in the mining\nand petroleum industries shows the level of\nprestige that at least one constituent college\nholds. Students have a group with which they\ncan identify themselves - just by looking at the\nsales of 'Imperial Medics' and 'RSM' branded\nclothing it can be seen that the identity aspect\nof the CCUs is alive - at least in some quarters\nof the College.\nNot all students in Imperial are the same. A quick comparison between Guildsheet, Prince\nAlbert and Broadsheet - all of which are\nlapped up by their target audiences and\nshunned by the others - highlights this. It is not\njust different publications; the tastes and\nrequirements of the students vary in many other\naspects too. In order to deal with this, the people running the CCUs have recently decided\nthat they need to attempt to provide every\naspect of a Union, slightly tailored to their own\nstudents - but the idea that this approach is\nfundamentally flawed has been understood in\nthe past. Very soon after the three older constituent colleges were brought together, their\npoint of view.''\n\"...CCUs\nare trying\ndesperately to\nemulate every\naspect of a union\nstudents realised that certain aspects of their\nunions would benefit from centralisation and\nworking together. Imperial College Union was\ncreated. However, even though this event took\nplace the best part of century ago, the CCUs\nare still refusing to realise that this should have\nresulted in a drastic change in their primary\nrole and raison d'e tre. CCUs have their own presidents, offices,\nevents, traditions and sports teams. Presently,\nthey all state their primary role as \"representing\ntheir students from an academic and welfare\nYou don't have to study this situation very hard to come to the\nconclusion that ICU is in a much better position to provide this core function. However, the CCUs insist on playing at providing some sort of\nacademic and welfare pro vi sion, which is inevitably comprehensively out-classed by\nthat provided by ICU. Even\npeople who were at Imperial\nten or fifteen years ago, at a time when the CCUs were much\nmore successful than they are now, are amazed\nat the fact that today's CCUs are trying to\nemulate all aspects of a union.\nOne of the areas in which it is very easy to\nsee the need for reform is the 'official chan-nel s' through which students, via their unions,\ncommunicate with the College on the quality of\nthe education they are receiving. Under the\npresent system, every year three CCU hacks\nstand for a position within their Constituent\nCollege Union called the Academic Affairs\nOfficer (the medics have yet to adopt this s ys tem). It is highly likely that this person is someone who does not have the support of their\npeers required to be voted in as a Department\nRep, and recent history suggests that they will\nthen be elected on the basis of a handful of\nvotes cast in a badly publicised and uncontested election. These people then go on to represent students on important College commit-tees. Yet with a deputy president at ICU now\nresponsible for education and welfare, the\nopportunities for change are now even more\napparent - perhaps student representatives on\nCollege committees should be elected at ICU's Academic Affairs Committee or something sim-i lar?

The game has been\nreleased on every machine and coincides nicely with the Xmas rush.\nThe idea behind the Worms series is to take a squad of the creatures into action against other player\nand computer controlled teams, and to be the one left standing at the end. The action is played out\nwithin a2D landscape and players take it in turn to unleash their arsenal of weapons amongst their\nrivals. Only one worm is controlled at any instant and there is a limited time to move it into a tactical\nposition and then fire. Much judgement will be required on your part if you want your bazooka shot to\nland on the enemy's head (taking account of the wind), or your grenade to explode at the critical\nmoment as it drops down that tunnel your foe is hiding in.\nThe landscape itself is both a potential soldiers gold mine and a tightrope walk over hell. While weapon\ncrates and first aid drops will improve your health and array of b army weapons, one false move and\nyou'll be taking a high dive into water - and the little fell as certainly can't swim. One mustn't forget the\nmines or oil barrels either. The fantastic thing about Worms is that every game you play is different.\nThere are some cool pre-defined landscapes to play on, or alternately you can randomly generate a level from the billions of possibilities available. Each time you start your team will be haphazardly scattered across the terrain, sometimes situated in decent vantage points, sometimes on dangerous cliff\nedges where all it takes is an embarrassing prod to send the little chap to his doom. Explosions eat\naway at the environment too, so the gameplay will actually change during each contest. All of this\nmeans that getting from one side of the land to the other is rather tricky. Unless you are good with a ninja rope or bun j ee cord (or else have a jetpack) you'll have to rely on skillful aiming to get at the pesky\nb lighters hiding from you in the distance.\nThe whole feel behind Worms Armageddon is cartoon y and cute, a smart move that makes the game\nappealing to everyone. Colourful and simple, the graphics are effective (by the way, the screenshot to\nthe left is from the Gameboy version), and you'd be ruining the atmosphere if you had the sound low.\nThe weapons are even wackier, with over 50 available, including super sheep, banana bombs, pneumatic drills, mini guns, mad cows, and holy hand grenades to name but a few.\nIn contrast with the cuteness, players are likely to get fraught during play. The fact that you name your\nown worms - personal ising them - makes you feel more responsible for your team and means that you\nwill do anything to win. When playing other humans, this calls for the making and breaking of alliances\nand basically hammering everyone you can at any opportunity. Luckily, the light-hearted relief uttered\nby dying worms may contribute towards alleviating the stress that builds up in multi-player binges!\nThe development team have certainly stretched the 2D concept of Worms to the limit and it's refreshing\nto see that such a simple idea puts to shame much of the graphically orientated 3D material on the\nmarket. As a single player game you may tire of the gameplay rather quickly, and it would have been\nnice to be able to zoom out and see the whole of the landscape at ai glance. The controls on the N64\nversion are also questionable. Rest-assured, however, that the juice you can squeeze from Worms\nArmageddon as a multi-player fest will quench your gaming thirst for ages.\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n15 December 1999: Issue 1161\nThe Chemical Brothers\nlive from Brixton\nElite admissions oust the lower classes\nFELIX NEWSTEAM\nImperial has continually reinforced\nits position amongst the countries\nelite institutions - and a new report\nhas revealed this can be largely\nattributed to an elite intake.\nRankings placed IC second\nworst in teh UK for bias against\nstate schools, with only 53 per cent\nof its intake coming from comprehensives, just one percent more\nthan Cambridge. The ranking was\nbased an a projected figure which\nwas correlated to the A Level\nrequirements of the intake. The\nCollege fared no better in the class\nstakes, ranking as the seventh most\nsocially exclusive higher education\ninstitution with just 5.1% of its\nintake coming from the poorest\nneighbourhoods. However, as the\nGovernment formulates its strategy\nto tackle high drop-out rates, Imperial has little to worry about with a rate of only 3 per cent - a figure\nbeing closely related to the high\nentry requirements.\nThe figures, compiled by funding body HEFCE, are the results of\na socio-economic analysis of\nadmission figures for the 1997-98\nacademic year. They formed part of\nHigher Education's first ever performance indicators, and have\nhighlighted the apparent boundaries that those from less affluent\nbackgrounds face throughout university education.\nThe average 27.4 A Level point\nscore obtained by Imperial students\nwill undoubtedly affect the demo-Student hardship for the new age\ngraphics of admissions according\nto ICU President Tasha Newton.\nFinding it difficult to identify a particular cause for IC's ranking (which\naccounted for each institute's entry\nqualifications) she stated, \"A Level\nresults are an established and fair\nway of doing things and that means\ncertain groups will not be admitted,\nbut it is extremely concerning that\nthose from state schools are ex clu d ed.\"\nThe College cites the community work, the Pimlico connection,\nPhoto: Jonas\nand the schools liaison scheme as\nmajor systems in their campaign to\nattract the best students irrespective\nof their background. Dr J Hassard,\nthe physics department's school\nliaison officer explained \"as far as\nrecruitment is concerned, I can\nassure you that we neither discriminate against nor favour state\nschools. We always go on ability\".\nUnfortunately, contrary to popular belief, Imperial may not be\ndoing its best in attracting the\nwidest range of the best students.\nDr Hassard explained: \"We do our\nbest with open days and summer\nschools, but we get a smaller percentage of respondents from state\nschools than we'd like...We give\nUCAS seminars - but we find some\nprivate schools decline since they\nrun their own extensive and intensive interview training, workshops\non filling in forms, guidance on\nwhat counts.... which are probably\ndenied most to state sector pupils\".\nDr Eastwood, Director of Planning and Management Information\nSystems, who is involved with the\nCollege's admissions, stated categorically that Imperial College certainly does not make it policy to\nexclude anybody; it is open to all\nwho wish to come here and satisfy\nthe minimum scholastic require-ment s. He pointed out \"The one\nthing we will never do is lower our\nadmissions criteria. It would be\nunfair to students if we did so - lowered entry standards might lead to\nstudents struggling and eventually\ndropping out\", he stated, noting\nthat \"we do well on drop-out rates.\nWhen people come in, they stay\nhere to complete their degrees\".\nThe Government are expecting\nthe Higher Education sector to take\naction over areas of weakness\nidentified by the performance indicators, Imperial College Rector,\nLord Oxburgh stated that \"It is\nentirely appropriate for government\nto identify its priorities and for universities to respond, to the extent\nthat they do not compromise their\nprime missions.\"\n\n"

    "content": "32 Films Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nscreen \\Z3\nDogma\nTo fans of Mallrats, Clerks and Chasing Amy, Dogma's Boxing Day release\nwill come as a fantastic Christmas present. However, whilst the similarities\nbetween those first three movies were utterly apparent, and thus the creative\nmastery of writer/director/actor Kevin Smith was plain for all to see, his latest movie marks a major change. Instead of the usual twin threads of unrequited\nlove and comic books, this time the movie is utterly given over to taking the\nmickey out of organised religion in general, and Catholicism in particular.\nHowever, whilst the movie has garnered a massive amount of criticism and\nabuse from Catholic groups in the US, it's actually an incredibly religious movie,\ninfused from head-to-toe with some old fashioned \"wouldn't the world be a better place if we were all nice to each other\" morality. Life of Brian this certainly ain't. Weird, however, it certainly is. Far and away the most off-the-wall movie I 've\nseen this year, Dogma's biggest downfall is actually the fact that it tries far\ntoo hard to be off-beat - Alan Rickman's visible demonstration of his asexuality (don't ask) or the sewage monster (very bad effects) or the appearance\nof Alanis Morrissette as god (most odd) or any one of a thousand other examples grate horribly (so much so that you'll want to close your eyes for an instant\nand pretend that you're somewhere eyes), and simply don't work. On the other\nhand, the originality of the piece is also it's triumph. Yes, it's a old-style road\nmovie (complete with regulation all star cast), and yes, there's a certain feeling of deja vu attached to some of the characters (Kevin Smith fans will be\ncheering the return of Jay and Silent Bob), but nonetheless, it's so damn weird\nthat you'll have your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish.\nThe one true flaw is Kevin Smith himself. As his previous movies have shown,\nhe writes tightly woven, introspective dialogue - not action chat. So, when\nthe pace of the movie is cranked up a notch, and the characters find themselves in imminent peril, they'll still be found offering immensely complex\ndiatribes on random bits of backstory - which just feels wrong. He needs to\nlearn the art of the punchy one-liner (and get some better special effects) if\nhe's ever going to make it to the real A list.\nThe real reason to see Dogma, however, remains the comedy: Jay and Silent\nBob are, of course, classic comedy characters; Chris Rock (as the thirteenth\napostle, sent back to earth to put some ethnic diversity into the Bible) can\nwisecrack with the best of them; and Alan Rickman (as the voice of god) is\nsublimely sarcastic. Even Ben Affleck and Matt Damon (reunited on screen\nfor the first time since Good Will Hunting) manage to tweak their usual amiable \"guy next door\" personas into a pair of psychotic ally comic forms. So,\nwhilst some of the religious gags aren't necessarily all that funny (with one\nor two spectacular exceptions), Jay and Silent Bob alone make for an incredibly entertaining ride.\nCotton Mary\nWhat do you expect of a Merchant Ivory production? The answer is probably either a period masterpiece or an overlong bore. Cotton Mary,\nthough it has a lot of interesting aspects, is unfortunately a prime example\nof the latter. Endless repetition and plot-lines that take ages to reach their\nobvious and predictable resolutions, turn what could have been an interesting eighty minute movie into a two hour boring stinker.\nThe film is set in India in 1954 and begins with Lily Macintosh (Greta\nScacchi), a British madam, giving premature birth. The psychological\nshock leaves her unable to breast feed, and the child is about to die (a rather anachronistic starting point for a story in our days of high-tech food).\nCotton Mary (Madhur Jaffrey), an Anglo-Indian nurse at the hospital, takes\nthe baby to her crippled sister, whose breast saves the baby's life. Lily invites\nMary to move to her grand country house and become her nanny. She says\n\"yes, nothing can stop me\", and that can be taken as the basic program\nfor the rest of the movie. She manages to convince the madam to throw\nout her right-hand man, and basically takes over his job, gets her friends\nemployed in the house and starts to wear her madam's clothes, shoes and\njewell ry. But in the end everything turns against her...\nThe greatest weakness of the movie is the screenplay. The dialogue\nbecomes pretty monotonous towards the end, the plot moves around in circles and some scenes are dragged out and repeated again and again, (with\nonly slight variations) until the audience wants to cry out: \"Get on with it!\nWe've seen that already!\" In particular, Mary's plot to overcome the servant Abraham comes to mind, which is initially quite clever, but is shown\nin such never-ending detail that someone really ought to shoot the dire c tor. And the end, which (according to production notes) \"exposes each of\nthe main characters' conflicting English and Indian identities\" (as if waving\nthe Union Jack were enough to do so), doesn't seem to belong to the rest\nof the film. Apparently it tries to give a twist to the plot and bring the problems of Anglo-Indians in the fifties (which are depicted earlier in the movie)\nto a stunning climax. Unfortunately, the reality isn't stunning and, even more\nunfortunately, the problems of Anglo-Indians weren't really depicted earlier in the film, more or less appearing out of the blue at the end.\nSo why does this film get two stars? Some of the acting is excellent, especially by Greta Scacchi as the psychologically torn and beaten Lily Macintosh\nand by Laura Lumley as her amazingly un-annoying 1 0-year-old daughter\nTheresa. The cinematography is beautiful and original (what else would you\nexpect)and the greatest saving grace is definitely the music, a stunning mixture of familiar and exotic sounds with a couple of well-placed God Save\nThe Queens. Listening to the soundtrack for two hours would definitely be\na more pleasing experience...\nDave Mark\n\n"

    "content": "14 Science Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nSeeing the light\nAs the 20th Century draws to a close, we are one step closer to the elusive quantum computer.\nAn international collaboration of scientists from !\n_\nAmerica and Japan have made another crucial\nbreakthrough in the development of a quantum\ncomputer.\nThe idea behind a quantum computer is that,\ninstead of using electrons to carry out computation,\nit would use photons, allowing it to take advantage\nof quantum effects. For example, the \"many worlds\"\ninterpretation means that when a particle is made to\ndecide between two possible routes, the universe\nsplits into two parallel universes. The quantum computer might even be able to use superposition in\norder to carry out calculations in several universes\nsimultaneously.\nTeams of researchers worldwide are working on\nall the elements required to build a complete quantum computer, but until now they had been held\nback by the fact that there was no way to manipulate photons precisely. However, the international\nteam have now developed a device which allows\nonly one particle through at a time, using an effect\nsimilar to a turnstile and the fact that when a high\nenergy electron drops to a lower energy, it releases\nthis energy difference as a single photon.\nJ Kim and his colleagues at Stanford University\nutilised a phenomenon unique to the quantum\nworld. First described by Robert Oppenheimer in the\n1920s, the so-called Tunnel Effect states that due to\nquantum uncertainty, an electron can and will pass\nthrough a physical barrier and appear on the other\nside. Therefore, if an electron \"tunnelling\" from a higher energy state to a lower energy state could be\nheld somewhere in the middle, in a sort of quantum\nwell, the subsequent arrival of another electron\nwould be prevented, as the occupying electron\nwould repel the oncoming electron due to its negative charge. The original electron could then be\nCould this be the computer of the future?\nallowed to carry on its path and the resultant jump\nin energy states would release a single photon,\nwhich could be detected using sensitive equipment.\nThe scientists were able to do this by placing\ntwo semi-conducting silicon wafers close together,\ndoped with different elements. On one side the\ndoping elements bond with the silicon to leave an\nexcess of electrons, and hence a negative charge.\nOn the other side, the silicon bonds to elements with\ntoo few electrons, creating a positive \"hole\" for the\nspare electrons to jump into.\nElectric currents are used to control the passage\nof the electrons into the quantum well by adjusting\nthe voltage and hence the amount of energy given\nto the tunnelling electron. The whole apparatus has\nto be kept just above absolute zero (-273aC) to stop\nthermal vibrations contaminating the system.\nThe results from this experiment proved that the\nnumber of photons emitted can indeed be re gul at ed. This in itself shows the validity of quantum theory and could also be used to mini atu rise computer\ncomponents to the nano scale, offering a new way\nof processing information.\nSU-YEN THORNHILL\n\"Public perception of science\nhas never been lower\"\nOpinion.\" Lindsay Gilmour attended Bernard Dixon's lecture at the Institute of Biology\nFormer New Scientist editor Bernard Dixon gave\nthe Charter Lecture for the Institute of Biology at the\nRoyal Society on 24 November. Stating that scientists are ultimately dependent on public support for\nfunding, he tried to explain how science journal-ism, and the way that scientists themselves talk to\njournalists, could help to change things.\nHowever, Dixon hi-jacked himself by spending\nnearly an hour in opposition to campaigning jour-nal is m. The 'GM food fur ore1 has clearly been\nbothering him, but his blanket accusations that\njournalists had no idea what they were talking\nabout rather fell apart under his own summary.\nDixon concluded that there are ten reasons why the\nBritish public don't want GM food on the shelves\nuntil more testing has been done, and not in the\nmiddle of the countryside - controlled conditions\nonly please. I won't list all ten, but trust me, only\none actually has anything to do with the science.\nIt really is time that the image makers of sci-en ce, people like Bernard Dixon, realised that 'GM'\nis not really a scientific debate, and that if they ally\nthemselves with it unconditionally then they can\nonly further tarnish the already creaky trust that the\npublic has in scientists. Come on folks, for once\nlet's exert a bit of that reasoned, rational approach\nthat science is meant to be so good at and admit\nthat the GM debate is about distrust of corporate\nAmerica, dislike of agribusiness, recent food\nscares, environmental worries and general resentment of something which we are told is no danger\nbut aren't offered any choice about.\nAnd by the time all those issues have been sorted out, the scientists doing the work might have\nsome more conclusive results about possible allergic reactions, dangers to Monarch butterflies and\nthe rest of it.

Ripe for\nredevelopment, this site is currently\noccupied by some sort of new-age\ntraveller commune, who call themselves the Unilateralist Communist\nLuvvies (UCL for short).\nCloser to home, and having\nmade some serious errors in costing\nout his new model village (particularly the model hospital and sports\nhall), wee Ian Caldwell is apparently in need of a calculator. Breakpoint is only too happy to oblige,\nand has bought him one which\n(luckily) is not capable of dealing\nwith negative numbers.\nIt is always being said that we\nshould look after the elderly during\nthis festive season, and so Breakpoint has managed to purchase life\nmembership of the Garrick Club for\nSimon Baker. As well as providing\nsomewhere warm for him to go during these cold winter months, he will\nfind the company just to his liking :\nplenty of cantankerous old farts\nbitching about how good it all used\nto be.\nTaking a break from Central\nLondon, I went to GenTech Labs\n(just outside Cambridge), where\nthey are offering various bits of\ngenetically-engineered human tissue at very reasonable prices. I was\nable to get quite a bargain on a single brain cell, which will make the\nperfect gift for the members of ICU\nCouncil -they can put it with their\nexisting one (and therefore have two\nto rub together). Perhaps this can\nserve as the beginning of a collection - don't hold your breath.\nFinally, Dave Roberts, my kind\nand understanding boss, deserves\nhis magnum of champagne to help\nhim celebrate the turn of the Millennium. Breakpoint understands that\nMr Roberts was teetotal until I started contributing to Felix. I would like\nto wish him all the best in his newfound drunken state.\nFeeling self-satisfied with a good day's shopping, I clambered\nawkwardly into the back of my limousine (why don't they make them\neasier to get into?), and told James\nto head for home. However, I still\ncouldn't shake the niggling feeling\nfrom my head that I'd forgotten a most important gift. It was only\nwhen greeted by my guard-dog that\nit hit me - and so it will give me\ngreat delight to send a signed picture of myself to Miss Natasha Newton. Merry Christmas all.\nBMS CRACKS - UP\nKevin has noticed that it has been quite chilly in\nthe BMS recently. He expected that such an intelligent building would have realised that winter\nwas coming and it would be getting cold. However, like everything else in the building, the\nheating system is ridiculously complex and cost\nfar more to install than a simpler system that\nwould have done the job better. The recent problems could have been solved by simply turning\non the under-floor heating system, but it appears\nthat either the building or its masters are reluctant to do this. Their fears are due to the fact\nthat, as the heating was not turned on last year,\nturning it on now may crack the floors...\nTEQUILA\nRecently, at one of ICU's bars, Kevin's attention\nwas drawn to a student who had just purchased\na large number of shots of tequila asked if the\nbar had any salt and lemon. The simple \"No\"\nshe received from the barman contained a hint\nof: \"We're the largest student venue in Londonnot another Firkin clone.\" Whilst Kevin agrees\nwith this sentiment, it did show him that some\nstudents want more from their union's bars. Here\nin the centre of London you don't have to go far\nto get some ideas of how we could inject more\nfun into ICU's bars. Just imagine what a difference an ice blender, cream and chocolate could\nmake to the cocktails.\nDARKNESS\nLike many people reading this column, Kevin is\nsuffering from a severe lack of daylight. Emerging from the lab or a lecture at five to find out\nthat it is already an hour after sunset can't be\npsychologically good for anyone. Kevin realises\nthat putting the clocks back appears to be a brilliant idea at the time you actually do it -especially if like most people you happen to be\nMish\nMash\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nin the situation where this permits an extra hour\ndrinking or an extra hour in bed. Kevin has\nbeen trying to find out why the nation insists on\nhaving this moment of short-term pleasure,\nknowing it is going to result in a whole winter\nof darkness. He believes it has something to do\nwith either Scottish farmers or reducing the\nselection pressure on the young of our species.\nKevin finds neither of these explanations for the\nloss of his evenings acceptable. Perhaps the\ndevolution of Scotland has been the first step in\nsolving the problem - to be followed of course\nby the creation of the Scot's own time-zone.\nLIE IN\nKevin was amazed to learn that, in some uni-vers i ties, nine o 'clock lectures were rare occur-rence s. At one institution, student's attendance\nat morning lectures had got so low that the university started to reschedule them for later in\nthe day. As a consequence the university ran\nout of time in the week. Instead of forcing its\nstudents to get up in the morning, the decision\nwas made to hold lectures on Wednesday after-noon s. This move infringed on time previously\nset aside for sports and other clubs and societies activities. Warwick's largely apathetic student body did little to attempt to counter the\nuniversity's move.\nCARELESS COFFEE\nIt has come to Kevin's attention that one of\nICU's Deputy Presidents has carelessly mislaid\nhis coffee table. Anyone who has recently\nacquired a black circular piece of furniture\nshould contact Kevin.\nTo comment or contribute:\nhttp://come.to/mishmash\nor email kevin@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

And what a year it was.\nMusic has never b 'en better\n(we won't mention that number one) and as we look forward to next year we all know\nthere's an upward trend. As\nfor the Christmas number\none, hopefully the re-release\nof Imagine will take the man-tle. It may be an old tune, but\nI 'll be surprised if there's a better tune in the running.\nPlease though God, do not\nlet Cliff win the race...\n.. frequency...\nhave a good one\nAs well as wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, the frequency editorial team of\nJames, Thorn and Boycey\nwould also like to say a big\nthank you to all our readers.\nWe've had a great time writing reviews and compiling\nthese pages and we hope\nthat you've had just as much\nfun reading them. We also\nhope that you don't disagree\ntoo much with our music of\nthe year choices, and we\nhope you can find one or two\ndelights in our stocking filler\nselection. There's also a few\nreviews of new music, but\nDecember releases are rarely\nthe best. There's also the\nsmall matter of the new Oasis\nalbum due for release in February. If ever there was an\nopportunity for an album to\ndefine the music of a new\ndecade this is it. So good luck\nNoel, I hope you can do it.\n''\"'^'i'%;'.:, Ti;\nAlbum of the Year\nTravis - The Man Who\nOnly one album released this year comes anywhere near to the timeless quality that the accolade of \"Album of the Year\" requires, and Travis' The Man\nWho is it.\nAs the current Radio One trail proclaims, 1 999 was the year of Travis. Stepping out of nowhere, they have been rewarded with massive album sales, a string of top twenty singles and across the board critical acclaim. More\nimportantly, they're hard to pin down - one review summed them up as\nRadiohead meets Oasis (depressed sigh meets an the mic chant, I guess) hardly does anyone any favours. Certainly they have Radiohead (circa The Bends)\ninspired moments, but then they're a lot more indie and, frankly, a lot more\nmainstream - you only have to look at the singles charts for proof, where\nyou'll find that Turn, Driftwood, Writing to Reach You and Why Does it Always\nRain On Me have notched up incredibly impressive figures for a band that\npractically no-one had heard of twelve months ago.\nUltimately, The Man Who stands out simply as an outstanding collection of\nsongs. The feel of the album as a whole might not be perfect - it jumps\naround rather than flowing through moods and styles as a classic album\nshould - but the tracks themselves are simply superb, and it's worth spending\nyour eleven quid just for the singles alone.\nAll music has it's own place and time (I'm a confirmed believer in the concept\nof owning music for every mood), and this album sits happily next to my stereo,\nawaiting stressed out nights or panic strike n days, when I can throw it on, melt\ninto my bed, and simply calm the fuck down. Idyllic.\nDave\nHi Single of The Year\nTLC - No Scrubs\nWith a lyrical delivery worthy of their\nbeautifully scribe d words, it is no\nwonder that TLC win the prize of\nFelix Single of the Year.\n1 999 was a great year for TLC. They\nrecaptured the popularity of their\nCrazySexyCool era and then surpassed it with massive amounts of\nradio and MTV play. No Scrubs and\nthe later-released Unpretty were\nsongs from the top draw and both\nhad girls and boys across the world\nsinging along. Not only were the\ntunes excellent, but the lyrics were\ncatchy and had more meaning than\nthose found in most other popular\ntunes.\nNo Scrubs takes the prize though as\nthe best of the two. It's original, s tyl ish, beautifully executed and almost\nperfect in every way. It universal\nappeal stamps the mark harder, and\nI'm taking no arguments about this\nbeing Single of the Year.\nJames\nstocking filler recommendations\nBasement Jaxx - Remedy\nHouse music for the masses, the Jaxx splashed a style of\ntheir own across the UK this year. The singles from the\nalbum also improved as the year went on, with the Jump\nand Shout conclusion breaking more than a few ear drums\nBeck - Midnite Vultures\nBeck does it again with this latecomer. It's a cocktail of influences and a delight on the ear.\nBlur - Thirteen\nNot quite album number thirteen, but Blur are getting close\nThe quality still shines after all this time and if you get this I promise you'll still be listening to it in ten years time.\nDeath in Vegas - The Contino Sessions\nA slow burner in the sales charts, but another excellent collection of songs that work extremely well together\nJohn Digweed - Bedrock Mix\nShortly edging out Sasha's Global Underground Ibiza mix,\nthis Bedrock Mix takes dance music mix of the year. The\nBedrock club night at Heaven also wins a prize as Felix's Best Club. Nice going John.\nEminem - The Slim Shady LP\nHe's ruse, he's bad and your mum hates him. So buy this\nfor your little brother and watch World War Three com-men ce. It's what family gatherings are all about.\n\n"

Having been\nobliged by our contracts to continue to pay rent over the Christmas holiday period, despite the\nfact that many people will be\nreturning home, it now transpires\nthat the normal conditions of our\nrent are also being changed. It is\na shame that students are being\ntaken advantage of by being\nmade to pay rent over this peri-od, whereas during the Easter\nand Summer breaks, when the\nhalls can be readily let to other\nstudents, there is no choice but to\nclear out. This is not, however,\nthe major gripe of most residents,\nmerely a sad reflection of apparent obsession, over and above\nthe welfare of the students, of the\nCollege for financial gain.\nThe main concern of many\nresidents regards the change to\nthe conditions of rent during the\nMillennium period for no apparent reason. It transpired, un surprisingly, that as many people\nwere interested in being in London over the Millennium, the\nhalls were likely to be a lot fuller\nthan they usually are over the\nChristmas holidays. So the College, with pathetically poor wisdom and far too late for the\nmuch needed foresight which\ncould have prevented all this,\nhastily posted a rather blunt\nquestion air re. When exactly will\nyou, the resident, be in halls over\nthe Millennium period? Once this\ndata had been collated, one was\nthen informed that that no guests\nwould be allowed in halls over\nthe period 1800 hrs on 27th December 1999 to 1800 hrs on\nJanuary 2nd! Perhaps it was too\nmuch to assume that the relevant\nbody would realise that no one\nwants to spend the Millennium\nalone. Many of those who had\nindicated that they would be here\nwanted, un surprisingly, to bring\nguests. This is also leading to\nbad feeling between students and\nstaff. Any students who do bring\nguests will be subject to full College disciplinary proceedings.\nWe have been hugely disappointed by the apparent ineptitude displayed by whoever has\ndealt with this. It is frankly laughable and we think that those who\nare \"in control of the situation\"\nneed to have a long hard think\nabout their handling of events.\nWe would suggest that perhaps\nthese measures have the very real\npotential to cause far more harm\nthan good?\nYours, not at all threateningly,\nPeter Harris & Jake Alexander\nAND FINALLY...\nDear all,\nIn return for being good little\nboys and girls this year, you can all\nexpect very generous treatment at\nChristmas, and an extra specially\nlarge present on Christmas Day\nitself.

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Arts\nmethod A, Faces of the 20th Century\nNational Portrait Gallery\nUntil 30 January\n\u00a33.00\nAt the beginning of the 20th Century the world\nhad the potential to become many things. Its\ndestiny could not have been predicted by the\ninhabitants of 1900, and the route to 1999 has\nbeen influenced by so many millions of in divi du als. The National Portrait Gallery is all about\nbringing us literally face-to-face with the people\nof our time. Its pictures are immensely revealing\nof the individuals behind the names, both\nfamous and obscure.\nNo portrait medium is more candid than photography. It is a medium which has brought us\nordinary people enlightenment and empower-ment. It has brought the whole world into our\nview. Here, ten people have been asked to select\ntheir ten faces of the century. Like all \"top 1 00s\", this selection is a little esoteric. It reflects the\nworld-view of the selectors, who range from\nDavid Bowie to Lord Putnam via Anna Ford and\nProfessor Steven Hawking.\nThe quality of the photos is un surprisingly superb. Always intimate and personal, these pictures human is e their subjects, who include\nnames like Henry Moore and Noel Coward.\nLord Sainsbury has selected pictures of Britain's enduring artists and writers - Thomas Hardy,\nBenjamin Britten, TS Elliot and Henry Moorewhile Vivienne Westwood mainly chose people\nwho wear her clothes. These include Helena\nBonham Carter, and rather self indulgently, a model wearing Westwood's fake Crown and\nErmine next to the Queen wearing the real thing.\nWhether or not one agrees with the choices,\neach selector makes a convincing and thought\nprovoking case for their group of ten. Steven\nHawking chooses British scientists as significant\ncontributors to our century: Rutherford, Turing,\nBertrand Russell, Flemming and Dirac.\nAll of these photos reflect the rich heritage of\n20th Ccentury Britain - her artists, scientists,\nstatesmen entertainers, and thinkers have exerted tremendous influence over our world, and our\ncultural tapestry is vibrant and strong. My personal f avi our it e photos were those of Samuel\nBecket, Noel Coward and Vivienne Lee - you can\nchoose your own.\nTom\nThe Merchant of Venice\nNational Theatre\n20th Dec - Mid January\n\u00a37.50 Student Standby.\nNot having a clue what this play was about and\nknowing only that it was to last three and a half\nhours, I did wonder if I would actually be able to\nfollow the story and stay interested for the dura-tion. As someone who finds Shakespeare difficult\nto read without those helpful little publisher's notes on the side, it was pleasantly surprising.\nSeeing it acted out is different. It helps a great\ndeal in understanding the dialogue, and even if\nyou can't keep up with every single line that is\nspoken, you soon begin to sit back, relax and\nwatch the action.\nThe play does start a little slowly, as we are introduced to a multitude of different characters.\nAlthough the play centres on several serious\nthemes (principally love, money and prejudice) it\nis quite lightheaded and humourous throughout.\nThrough Trevor Nunn's direction, the humour of\nthe dialogue is enhanced by the actions, facial\nexpressions and even accents of the actors on\nstage. Antonio, the Merchant of Venice himself,\nactually has a thick Northern accent, and others\ninclude African, Polish and Spanish.\nA well chosen cast, all dressed in 1950s style\nclothing also contribute to giving this play the success it has achieved, reflected in its recent move\nto the much larger Olivier Theatre. It was sold out\nwhen I went to watch. The star of the show for me\nhad to be the character of Portia, played by\nDerbhle Crotty. Her acting was excellent, stealing\nthe majority of laughs during the performance,\nand one scene in particular, centred around a Spanish Prince visiting as a suitor, ended with the\naudience erupting simultaneously into laughter\nand applause. Although at times you wonder how\nmuch of the three and a half hours is left to go,\nby the time you leave you might just want to get a copy of this play and read it for yourself (if you\nhaven't already) - I know I might.\nHina\n\n"

Thunder shook the field as the players\ntook the pitch, and the start of\nthe match was delayed as Dave\nGol chased Penguins off the\npitch...\nPlaying with the wind, C&G dominated, especially in the for-wards, where our clear weight\nand strength advantage was\nobvious. After a number of\nknock-ons, the first of many tries\nwas scored as the forwards\ncrashed over for Howard to\ntouch down. Shortly after this, a second try was added by Will\nStevens, as he belly flopped over\nfrom a few metres out. Many tries\nfollowed, and the rest of the half\nwas a scrappy affair with the\nminers stealing just one opportunist try.\nGuild's second half account\nwas opened by Akira, as the forwards showed their strength with\na25m drive from a line-out. By\nnow the contest was over and\nC&G turned on the style as Ally\nJefferies went over after an inspirational dummy, only to be followed up by a nicely worked\nDave Gol try. At this point Nipply\nstepped up to drop kick a conversion attempt. He missed.\nShortly afterwards he again\nshowed his kicking prowess,\npunting the ball to the opposition\nbackwards (as usual).\nC&G's final tally was an\nembarrassment, and with the\ngame rapidly becoming pointless\nthe ball was intercepted inside\nthe 22 after a no look pass.

It was a good solid performance which kept the opponents out\nof the game the whole time.\nIndeed, the result was never really\nin doubt, thanks to the superior\nability of our players.\nCourtney was killing the ball to\nthe opponent's court all the time;\nSandrine was like a defensive wall,\nconstantly stopping any attacking\nattempt from RHUL (I think they\nwere getting annoyed with it...);\nand Lucia got the MVP award due\nto her brilliant display as a setter.\nThen we had MariaJo in great\nshape, together with the incredibly\nconsistent Phot and our two Constantinos making sure the job\nMixed Volleyball\nwould get done.

Nevertheless, our team fought hard - very\nhard indeed. We won the first set\nwith no major difficulties, but then\nthey came back and got the two\nthat followed (the third set was\nextremely close and could have\ngone either way). Major tactical reorganisation of the team was carried out, and we clinched the fourth\nset with relative ease. In the decisive set, a series of un forced errors\non our behalf made the balance of\nthe match tip over to UCL's side,\nwith a final set score of 15-17. It\ndefinitely wasn't fair, though, since\nwe were the better team - ask any-one...\nNever mind, the team played\nwell and clearly showed we have\nreasons to be confident regarding\nour future in this competition. In\nparticular, there was a spectacular\nattacking display by the captain,\nConstantinos, and some groovy\nimprovisation by Etienne, whose\nimaginative setting kept the opposition on constant alert.

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix Feature 41\nit was a full ten minutes before I realised that\nmy mouth was still open. Whilst a younger\nversion of Jerry Hall had the rapt attention of\nmy colleagues across the table, I struck up a conversation with a red-headed girl who had\nwandered over. I asked her about her job\n(clich ed,I know) and she answered with surprising frankness.\nShe said that she earned around \u00a3600 a night and that she worked three nights a week.\nShe also explained that whenever she worked\nshe never failed to get utterly smashed from all\nthe drinks that the punters bought her.\nFurthermore, she said that she absolutely loved\nher job. I have to confess that I felt sorry for her\n- she was only eighteen (the youngest in the\nclub, she proudly informed me) and when she\nsaid that she really liked her job, I sincerely think\nthat she meant it. It struck me that most of the\nother girls were very professional in their attitudes and in the way that they saw the jobs as\na \"necessary\" evil. I'm sure that most of them\ndo enjoy it to some extent, but they also realise\nthat there's more to life than being ogled by\nsweaty, overweight, inebriated, middle-aged\nbusinessmen. This girl, however, really didn't appear to see the bigger picture, and seemed\nto have reached the pinnacle of her aspirations.\nHowever, it sounds very cynical and judgmental of me to say that (probably because it is very\ncynical and judgmental), so I think I 'll leave it\nat that.\nAfter the meal was over, we were escorted\nby a throng of beauties from the \"restaurant\"\narea into the \"club\" area downstairs, and made\nourselves comfortable in the executive chairs.\nA \u00a31 1 0 bottle of whiskey was ordered, and we\nfoolishly set about quaffing even more alcohol.\nI was tremendously pleased to notice Tania\nappearing again, and with sweaty palms I delved into my wallet for a ten pound note. She\naccepted it with a gracious smile that made my\nheart melt, and took me by the hand to lead\nme to an empty sofa. There I sprawled with a drunken grin on my face, as she proceeded to\nengrave herself (in Dolby Digital and ultra-high\nresolution) straight into the most private and\nguarded areas of my mind.\nWhen you have your first dance, you feel\nextremely awkward about what you should be\ndoing with your arms, face etc. Do you smile\nconstantly and risk aching cheeks the next day,\nor do you watch with a cool detached ness, periodically raising one eyebrow to signify your\nappreciation. To be honest, by my second or\nthird dance, considerations like these had been\ncast into utter insignificance by the sheer\namount of alcohol I'd guzzled during the\nevening.\nThe clientele was almost exclusively male,\nand I was astonished to see a \"normal\" woman\nsit down at the table next to ours with some\nmale companions. At an advanced hour of the\nmorning I casually lean t across, tapped her on\nthe shoulder, and stated that I had compiled\nthree theories as to why she was in this place.\nTell me, she said, raising her eyebrows. And so\nI did - I had concluded that she must either:\n1) have an exceptional amount of self-confidence;2) be of the lesbian persuasion; or 3)\nbe mad. She laughed, indicating that 1) she was\nnot offended and 2) she must have been as\npissed as me. Then she proceeded to explain\nthat she was in fact none of the above, but was\nin fact Scottish. I told her that one of her male\ncompanions looked very much like David\nGilmour (of Pink Floyd fame), but she assured\nme that he was not, because he was in fact the\nManaging Director of the Bank of Scotland.\nHaving received this particular piece of in tell i gence, and feeling that I was possibly a little\nout of my depth, I gracefully thanked her for her\ntime and turned back to talk to my slightly less\nillustrious friends.\nThe rest of the evening blurred together into\none bliss fu! and hedonistic haze, but I will\nspare you any further details. I seem to remember that I fell in love all over again, this time\nwith a sublime creature from Sweden, but I cannot remember fully, and do not want to present\nyou with falsehoods. The last thing I do remember is confessing to Tania that I was not a management consultant from New York, but\nwas in fact a slightly overwhelmed and very\ndrunk student from Imperial College.

    "content": "40 Feature Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nOne night\nin heaven\n(almost)\nL ast night (1 7th November 1 999) I had the\npleasure of spending an evening in\nStringfellows and, as a result, I think that\nmy life has been subtly changed. I would like\nto share this experience with you, the reader,\nbecause I think you will be quite amused and,\nbe you male or female, I refuse to believe that\nyou don't harbour at least some curiosity for\nwhat goes on in London's must well-known\nand high-class strip-club.\nI have made the decision to write this\nanonymously because I do not want to be\naccused of bragging, which I will inevitably do\nshamelessly throughout this article. I also know\nthat I will fail to present the facts with any professional journalistic objectiveness, so right\nfrom the outset I will sate that it shall not be my\nintention to do so.\nFirst of all, I will begin by saying that the\nentire evening was made possible by a person\nwhose identity will, of course, remain anonymous, and secondly that the amount of money\nI spent (despite heavy subsidy from a fore men-tio ned benefactor) will remain undisclosed.\nWe entered Stringfellows at around 8pm and were shown to a table which had been\nbooked for us. On first impression we could\nhave been at a normal restaurant. Everything\nwas slightly cramped due to the number of extra\ntables that had been put in for the football, and\nthe decor was a little kitsch - mirrors, drapes,\nsoft lighting and that kind of thing - but apart\nform that it wasn't out of the ordinary. Unless,\nthat is, you count the girls wrapped expertly\naround several strategically placed poles in various states of nudity.\nAt this point I need to interrupt the narrative and say something about these girls, who\nwill inevitably crop up quite regularly throughout this article. I fear that I might exhaust my\nsupply of superlatives when describing them,\nand as a result you will become blunted to\nthem, which is why I will describe them only\nonce, right here: these women were absolutely\nfabulous - they were creatures who populate\nonly your most daring and unspoken dreams;\nthe kind of females who cause car crashes when\nthey walk down the street. I think you get the\ngeneral idea of what calibre of woman I'm talking about.\nSo there I was, trying heroically to concentrate on my steak (which, incidentally, was\nsuperb) whilst beside me some breath-taking\nexpanse of naked flesh was twisting lasciviously\nto the rhythm of the music. It was deeply sur-real, and to actually eat my whole plate took\nme a long time. As we finished our meal and\nthe wine and beer began to smooth over our\nnervousness, women who had been hovering\ndiscrete ly behind began to close in on us. The\nfirst to approach was a Russian beauty named\nTania, who sat down at our table (and I will\nopenly admit right now that I am deeply in love\nwith her). The way she made contact was typical of most of the women that night. They\nwould approach you unabashed whilst locking\ntheir eyes into yours, a welcoming yet suggestive smile curling their lips. Then a long arm\nwould drop over your shoulder and she'd casually introduce herself:\n\"Hi, my name's Claudia, what's yours?\nAre you having a good evening? Would you like\nit to get any better?\" After a bit of self-conscious\nmumbling, I quickly got the hang of chatting\nabout some inanity (without too much ogling)\nand successfully kept up the pretence that this\nwas some sort of \"normal\" conversation. The\ngirls were extremely quick at identifying our\nbenefactor as the most well-off in our group,\nand thus he initially got all the attention, especially from Tania. But, since it was so early in\nthe evening, there was a large surplus of\nfemales, so there were always...erm...enough\nto go around.\nAfter I finished my meal and had gotten over\nthe disappointment of Tania's initial lack of\ninterest, I decided - as there was a large screen\non the wall behind me - that I would watch the\nfootball for a bit. So there I sat, cigarette in one\nhand, Belgian larger in the other, trying to see\nsome of the game, whilst out of the corner of\nmy eye a half-naked Mediterranean stunner was\ndoing very innovative things with her pole - and\nI was asking myself, does it get any better? The\nanswer turned out to be yes.\nI noticed that our benefactor had slipped\nTania a ten pound note, and she was asking us\nall to move our chairs back. She positioned herself in front of one of our group and proceeded\nto slowly dance and strip, whilst a profound\nsilence descended over our table. I will not\nattempt to put her actions into words, as I would not do them justice; I will merely say that\n\n"

    "content": "15 December 1999 \u2022 Felix News 3\nTuition fees threatened Medical Library relaid\nSUNIL RAO The run-up to Christmas should see\na bombshell dropped - at least as\nfar as university education is con-cern ed. The Cubie report is set to\nstrike a powerful blow against\ntuition fees north of the border.\nThis report is expected to feature amongst its recommendations\n(if the Consultation Papers published by the committee are anything to go by) the abolition of\ntuition fees, the re-introduction of\ngrants, additional support for part-time and graduate students,\nchances to the means-testing s ys tem, and increased loans for students in Higher Education. The\ncommittee has visited a number of\nScottish campuses and has\nreceived hundreds of written\nresponses to its Consultation\nPapers.\nThe publication of the report\nwill see Imperial College Union\njoining forces with virtually every\nother university in Britain - regardless of affiliation with the Aldwych\nGroup (the student unions of the\n\"better\" un is) or the National Union\nof Students (NUS) - in writing to\nMPs, Downing Street and every\nnational newspaper. According to\nICU President Natasha Newton,\nthe letter will include text to the\neffect that \"given the findings of the\nCubie Report, we hereby request\nan immediate enquiry into the current fees and grants situation for\nstudents hailing from England,\nWales and Northern Ireland\".\nWhile it is true that a similar\nreport has less of a chance of having its recommendations operated\nhere in England (Scotland has very\nfew independent (private) schools\nand the Liberal Democrats, who\nhave always campaigned against\ntuition fees, have far less power\nhere) it does appear that the report\nwill still have significant repercussions on the way student funding is\nlooked at here \"down South\". The\nfourteen-member Cubie committee\nhas as its convener Andrew Cubie,\nsenior partner of leading Edinburgh commercial law firm Fyfe\nIreland WS and former chairman of\nCBI Scotland (ironically one of the\nbodies in favour of retaining tuition\nfees).\nANDREW OFORI\nWorries over the Charing Cross\nlibrary renovation, voiced at the Vice\nPrincipal's Question Time last week,\nappear to have been addressed by\nthe Feasibility Study Group.\nStaff and students from Charing\nCross highlighted a number of\nissues concerning the planned overhaul and restructuring of the library\nbuilding. They felt that the new plans\nwould reduce access to reference\nmaterial, increase noise levels and\npossibly disrupt students studying for\nexams. Many were particularly concerned with the lack of consultation\nbetween the planning group and the\nCharing Cross community, but there\nhas now been some positive\nresponse from the students.\nWith these issues in mind the\nFeasibility Study Group convened to\nlayout the plans for each floor. The\ncommittee, made up of senior medical professors, estates personnel,\ncontractors and the ICSM President,\ndecided that the majority of the\nlibrary would be housed on the second floor. Made up of 151 work\nplaces, the second floor facility will\ninclude reference materials, a photocopying room, video workstations,\nlibrary offices and PCs. The first floor\nwill house a smaller section of the\nlibrary along with UMO and other\nadministrative offices. There are\nalso plans for two seminar rooms on\nthe concourse.\nWorries about the reduced\nnumber of PCs were allayed by the\nfact the amount will increase. A review of the desks dimensions\nanswered concerns about loss of\ndesk space and the problem of\nincreased noise levels was solved,\npartially by the floor plans and partially by soundproofing.\nRetaining its common room, the\nground floor remains largely in tact,\non the other hand the lower ground\nfloor will be the new home to 70\nnetworked PCs, a journals store,\nfour seminar rooms, a gym, and two\nstudent Union rooms.\nBecky England, the ICSM President described the new plans as\n\"fairly positive\" and expressed her\nintention to follow the development\nof the plans carefully, and keep the\nstudents informed of all develop-ment s. East Meets West show trades on past successes\nJANNE N VAMADEVA\nThe cultural mixing point of the year\nwhich promised to be all things\ngood from the East combined with\nthe best aspects of the West, resulted\nin the annual East meets West show.\nThe show, organised by the Indian\nSociety, combined dance, music and\ncomedy in an exhilarating performance with a distinctive flavour and\nstyle.\nAfter an hour long delay, the\ncom peres announced the plan for\nthe evening with rousing jokes to\nhype up the already raucous crowd.\nThe classic medic vs non-medic line,\nthough thoroughly over-used\namongst IC people, still managed to\nget a rapturous reception from a sea\nof vibrant colours and traditionally\ndressed people.\nThe Indian Society attempted -but did not truly manage - to merge\nthe two different (yet beautiful) cul-ture s. There would be a western act\nfollowed by an Eastern act, but there\nwas no real mixing or fusion the two.\nOne would have hoped to see western music with a traditional Asian\ndance such as Kathak or Bharatnatyam. Surely that would show the\nprogressive nature of the East in\ncombining with Western tradition?\nThe traditional shows were all of\na high standard - in particular\nSalman, Radhika and the dance\nroutine Bugaboo. But why so many?\nOne and a half hours to the interval\nis too long, and there is no need to\ndo five versions of the same act. The\nimpact of the show was weakened\nby the sheer volume of acts. It was\na pity that the highlight of the entire\nshow, a Michael Jackson impersonator, was a dancer brought in and\nnot from the home-grown talent of\nImperial.\nNext year, the Indian Society\nshould cut down on the number of\nacts, while maintaining a cross-sec-tion of entertainment. The show did\nnot really address the full breadth of\nAsia's heritage, and there were no\noriental themes or bharat natyam. Moreover, the show might have\ngained from the com peres allowing\nit to flow smoothly rather than intervening with their own brand of\nhumour.\nThe show, although good and\nundeniably a success, can and\nshould be made more professional.\nThe aim of the organisers must be to\ndevelop the show - then the annual\nEast meets West will truly be a spectacular combination of two great\ncultures.\n\n"

The biggest and most raved\nabout (OK, so Fabric's big too) club in London opens its\ndoors every Thursday night to a horde of beat-seeking, style-loving students, and creates what is arguably London's biggest student night. Admired from afar, home really does\nmake it. With the recent arrival of one of, if not the biggest\nexternal video screens in the capital, and the incredible\namount of style whipped up in having escalators to take you\ninto this demon of a super club, home really does complement its sleek 1, Leicester Square address, and it just seems\nthat little bit more special.\nDespite only opening three of its eight floors on student night,\nthe dancefloor s on levels two and three, accompanied by the\nbalcony up on four provide enough space to accommodate\na significant sector of the London student population. The\nchill -out rooms, bathed in their veils of pastel light, are like\nsomething from a sci-fi movie, whilst the cloakroom is a sequence of elliptical holes in the wall, shrouded in low tone\ncolours, its function only apparent when you see the guy's head appear through one of them. Weird science, but it\nworks well. Not a normal inclusion in a club review, but the\ntoilets were as art deco and stylish as the rest of the place,\nand with a giant slanting glass pane functioning as all the uri-nal s, and top name sprays and cosmetics by the astoundingly clean washbasins (I'm assured the ladies is just as chic), it\ndeserves a mention.\nAs for the tunes; the second floor slammed out some grilling\ndrum 'n' bass early on, but most of my time was spent up on\nthree, full on house and hard house, with residents Tayo,\nJunior Cartier, and Stuart Lovell, alongside Paul Arnold and\nJustin Robertson, sharing the floors with beats a plenty, the\ncrew capably satisfying the hardiest club ber. Perhaps the night's only flaw is that in amongst the regimental efficiency of the whole layout, and the awe-inspiring perfection that defines home, there's a bit of a lack of soul, and\nit's treated more as an experience than a good night out. But,\nif you've got a103 slot free on your Thursday night, a fiver\nto get in (\u00a32 all drinks inc. Red Bull and Smirnoff!), and you\nwant a serious clubbing spectacle, then get down to Highrise,\nit's highly recommended and you'll have a top time. Blinding!\nPete\nFabric\n@ Fabric\nFabric and home are both London \"supper-cubs\" which attempt to bring back the title\nof best club in the UK to London. They opened within two months of each other and\ntheir Saturday nights offer similar music, home is open till 3 and at 3 the music shuts\noff the lights go on and everyone is told to go Home. Fabric on the other hand has\na24 hour licence and finishes at 7ish on a Saturday and until home is late licensed\nthere is literally no comparison between the clubs.\nFabric is a dark moody underground space with brick lined walls and three differing\ndance floors. It used to be a cold store for Smithfield market and the tradition of\nkeeping things cold has been continued with the largest and most effective air conditioning I have ever seen in a club. Fabric also has the longest queue I have ever\nseen at a club, even the guest list queue was 20 minutes long and as the club was\nrammed inside it couldn't have been long before they were counting \"one in one out\"\nif they weren't already doing so at 1 1 :1 5.\nSasha has a monthly residency with Fabric and performs on the first Saturday of every\nmonth in room 1, along with Craig Richards and Muzik magazine's 'up and coming\nDJ of the year' Lee Burgess. Hybrid were the main draw in room two, were best\ndescribed as bit like faithless, and truly excellent. Music then varied from drum 'n' bass\nthough mashed up break beats to James Brown across rooms 2 and 3. Unfortunately\nwhen Hybrid came off stage at 1 :20 the already busy main dance floor became\nunbearably crowded. For a club of this size the main room should be at least 50%\nbigger than it is. Having said this the much vaunted body sonic or vibrating dance\nfloor was not just a gimmick but added another dimension to the mixing, one excellent moment when the floor began vibrating more as the kick drum faded in was\nenough to prove this.\nSasha was due to play 2-4 and when he put down the headphones at 4:20 it was\nstill debatable that home might be better. Lee Burgess followed on and proved he was\nbetter than any home resident save Danny Rampling and Oakenfold (the former better watch out). However, Sasha came back on unexpectedly at 5:30 to a nicely busy\nbut no longer crowded dance floor. He found another gear and proceeded to have\na 'who can make the crowd go off most?' contest with Burgess till 7:20. The question was not 'is this the best club in London?' but 'is this best club in the world?'\nOne of the best things about Fabric is the value. There may be somewhere else you\ncan get a bottle of beer for \u00a32.50 at 4:30 on a Sunday morning in London but Harts\nfood and wine isn't exactly my idea of a good night out. The unisex toilets and chill\nout beds with 8 people on are unfortunately not as per vy as you would think, but the\nover crowding means that the IC geeks will have a rare opportunity to come into\nclose bodily contact with a woman. Fabric is crowded and arriving 20 minutes before\nopening and queuing for an hour is inevitable, but for \u00a312 and a7 am tube ride\nhome (same price as Equinox and cheaper beer) you can't argue.\nA/ ex\n\n"

    "content": "8 Travel Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nLying in a rain soaked tent on the verdant slopes\nof the Lake District, Tom, Alex and I inevitably\nknew that we were to return to the dense smog\nof the metropolis. If only we could have stayed\nin the salubrious surroundings of the windswept\nmountains... The conversation steadily rounded\nonto the subject of what-the-hell-we-were-going-to-do-in-the-summer-for-three-months - the idea\nof linking the two came quickly despite the numbness of our minds. On returning to London, the\nexpeditionary machine rumbled into action. We\ndiscovered that one of our colleagues, Koen, had\nalready done some research into the possibility\nof wandering around the Andes for a few days,\nand another fellow student, Andrew (a former rock\nclimber) lent his input to the team effort. Having\npulled together our ideas, along with an ambitious mountain climbing schedule, we set off to\nthe IC Expeditions Board with our proposal. After\nhalf an hour of nerve-w racking negotiations, it\nbecame clear that our plans were as watertight\nas a sponge....\nAs a group of inexperienced climbers, looking to scale the tallest tropical mountain in the\nworld, the members of the Board had rejected\nus and told us to come back with some better\nproposals. Our appeals for sponsorship subsequently failed (though we did manage \u00a310 worth\nof Burger King vouchers spent on a drunken night\nin Central London). Unfortunately, both Koen and\nAndrew joined expeditions that had been sponsored by the Expeditions Board, and our final\nteam was reduced to four members: Tom, Alex,\nPaul and Tom's friend, Murray. To our great aston-ish ment, one of our hopeful sponsorship letters\nwas returned positively. One particularly generous little shop in St Albans had decided to let us\nlook round their shop to see if anything might\ninterest us. After a round of crafty dealing we\nwalked away with almost \u00a32000 of equipment\nat an astonishing 40% discount - such are the\nmathematical powers of IC students over mere\nmortals.... Almost overnight the distant dream\nhad grown into fruition.\n[ preparation ]\nAcclimatisation to the extreme altitudes in the\nPeruvian Andes was paramount, and a trek\nin the stunning Cordillera Huayhuash with some\nAmerican friends was deemed to be the ideal\nsolution to this problem. The trek itself is\nanother story, not without its own incidents, but\nthere is little space for it here....\nIn order to augment our safety, it was decided\nthat a guide would be required to provide his\nknowledge on Andean weather, mountain routes\nand the glaciers. The top mountain guide in the\ncountry recommended Maximo, and his enthusiasm for the task was second to none. Murray,\nhowever, had been ill since his arrival in Peru and\nhad lost a lot of his strength. On our return from\nHuayhuash he had a pain in his lungs which\nturned out to be an infection, requiring him to\nstay in bed for four days taking antibiotics. As a result, our first peak, Pisco, was summit ted without Murray, and, although it was a relatively easy\nON TOP\nOF THE\nWORLD\npeak, we did experience problems along the way,\nbefore battling our way to the top, to experience\none of the best views in all of the Andes. The four\nof us arrived back in Huaraz the following day\nwith a little more experience and acc lim at is ation behind us, before scaling Peru's tallest peak,\nHuascaran Sur.\nPaul is an incredibly able blok e and he very\nsoon earned my respect for his judgement. He's also a fussy bastard when it comes to food, so I was very glad when he took a keen interest in\norganising that aspect of our planned six days\non Huascaran. He did a very meticulous job and\nturned out some fantastic meals in some extraordinary places.\nThe other issue of discussion was porters. I was personally of the opinion that we should not\ntake them as it was (in a way) cheating - I wanted\nto climb this mountain myself. I could, however,\nsee the very obvious reasons why it was sensible\nand was consequently passive when the others\nelected to take them. For Murray, however, there\nwas no choice, as his weight had tumbled to 58kg and he simply had no strength left to carry his\npack. The other danger was if one of us got ill,\nwhich would seriously jeo pardi se the chances of\nthe others. Maximo came back with 3 unlikely\nlooking porters: one a cook, one an experienced\nclimber and one a pin ball machine!\n[ days 1 and 2 ]\nThe first day consisted of a1200m ascent to\nbase camp at 4200m.I had the s quits, but\nthrough my experience trekking in Nepal (where\nthe Delhi belly was a feature of everyday life) I 've\nfound the ideal cure: Dire Straits at high volume\non the walkman! It was a very pleasant afternoon\nstroll with magnificent views, but rather distressing as we heard tale after tale from people\ndescending who had failed to reach the summit\nbecause of high winds, altitude problems, crevasses and looming sera cs. The view that evening looking as we looked\nacross the Rio Santa valley towards the Cordillera\nNegra (a range of snow-free mountains up to\n5500m) was quite stupendous and did wonders\nfor the already high morale of the group. We set\noff early the next morning for camp 1 (5200m).I was concerned that this step of 1 000m was too\nmuch, especially for Murray who had been at\n3100m for 5 days since the Huayhuash, and I still consider it nothing short of a miracle that\nnone of us had any problems whatsoever that\nnight. It was exceptionally cold and again we\nheard tales from teams sponsored by big name\nmanufacturers of difficulties in the ice fall just\nabove camp 2 on the co!. We were psyched, and\nour moods were buoyed by our lack of acc lim at is ation problems.\n[ day 3 ]\nWe set off very early, on our third consecutive day of clear blue skies, in order to make\ncamp 2 before the snow had a chance to soften.\n\n"

    "content": "Music Felix \u2022 15 December 1999\nfrequency y/^ Fun Loving Criminols\n@ Brixton Academy\nThe Fun Lovin' Criminals are cool. By that I mean that it is they themselves\nthat are cool and not just their music. They love playing their music and it\nshows. They love performing in front of a crowd and it shows. Not only do\nthey love it but they also know how to bring the best out of themselves and\nput huge smiles on the faces of the crowd, ones which were probably still\nthere two days later. Saturday night at Brixton academy was an experience\nthat started not so much with a bang, but more of a 'uh-huh' as The King\nplayed support. He wasn't particularly bad, but neither did he sound as if\nhe should have escaped the top end of the pub circuit. The crowd were\ngood-natured enough to give a small amount of applause but they really\njust wanted The Criminals to come on stage.\nHowever, after the King had finished his set we had to wait a while longer\nas we were treated to a screening of Maui homicide 2000 - FLC's new 20\nminute short film. Imagine if you will a bunch of guys deciding they wanted a bit of a laugh and had the money to film a few amusing notions they\nhad floating around their head. Imagine a seventies cop show shot on a dod gy handheld camera with the actors taking the piss. That was this film.\nEvery single moment of the film Huey and Fast were carrying, and drinking from, a bottle of Corona. Even when they were jumping over bushes\nwith a pistol firing from one hand, in the other would be a bottle of beer.\nNice. By all rights the film should have been as boring to watch as one\nyour mate had made while pissed on a Saturday afternoon but somehow\nit turned out to be something of a cult classic...\nWhen the Criminals finally came on they did so with a roar and started as\nthey meant to go on - loudly. Listening to their albums beforehand I wondered if some of the songs would transfer well to a live gig but after hearing them play I found out how wrong I was. FLC had - for want of a better phrase - \"toughened up\" some of their songs so that they played better\nin front of a live audience, and it worked amazingly well. Their mellow\nsongs were still mellow but the songs that had lain somewhere in between\nmellow and jumping were elevated to that higher level needed for a live\ngig. There were no bad points in the whole set but of course the classics\nsuch as Scooby Snacks, King of New York and Big Night Out got the crowd\nshouting more than the rest. The final song of the set was the best ever version of We Have All the Time in the World (1 0 times better than that found\non Come find Yourself) and it left us begging for more, but unfortunately\nour two hours was up and we had to make our way back to the tube.\nThis was the best concert I 've been to for a long while and it just confirms\nmy view of Brixton as the best London live venue - I can't wait for both my\nreturn and that of the Criminals.\nTim\nChemical Brothers\n@ Brixton Academy\nHey boy, hey girl, hey you what you doing here? Hey freak left over from the\ndays gone by of grunge and psychotic episodes. Hey teen ie bopper in the\ncorner WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? Hey want some pills? Or Es? Or something to last the night (Charly anybody)? Oh yes it's all under one groovy\nroof. It's laser supreme with dod gy burgers and fries to go... here we go!\nTwo years after the hype over 'electronica' and its subsequent failure to meet\nthe music industry's desire for the 'next big thing', electronic music is, nev-er the less, more a part of our musical consciousness than ever before. That\nis, if your consciousness can cope in an environment such as this. You\nbought Block Rockin' Beats because your friends had it, but can the move\nfrom the relatively safe realm of the warehouse party to that of the ticketed\nrock concert do the electronic culture any good?\nThis is no ordinary venue. The Academy has a lingering sense of darkness\nabout it, that and the lack of a queue makes you think something isn't quite\nright. Oh why oh why didn't you tell me they were on at 1 am? James Holroyd doesn't do the venue any justice, but has a few nice moments, and\nfinally lets Sasha tease the crowd. You know that tune, no you don't, and it's cunning, a seamless montage of body shaking beats and bass lines with no\ndirection. But you have to leave it to a couple of unassuming-looking Mancunians to blow the roof off the Academy (complete with castle and\nlanterns). But, mind you, with all of the flashes of assault ive bright light that\nwere directed at the audience from the front of the stage, you might think\nthat the group didn't want anyone looking in that direction to begin with.\nBuried beneath a veritable el ek tro bank of synths, sequencers and drum\nmachines, Tim Rowlands and Ed Simons took the sound system to the limit,\ntwisting and bending their tracks almost to breaking point. The lights came\nto life at 1 am with a bottom-heavy take on Hey Boy Hey Girl, leaving the\naudience barely time to recover before launching into a seamless flow of\nBlock Rockin' Beats, Under The Influence, Out Of Control. You have to admit\nthe clash of cultures in the music (and in the venue) - a warm sound stemming from a love of rock and roll perhaps, 60's psychedelia, remnants of\nbig beat lost in the transition from Dig Your Own Hole to the undoubtedly\nexcellent Surrender.\nThe best thing about the Chemicals live is they look like they are having a great time, but the party isn't just on the stage. It's on the dance floor. Its all\naround us. Anyone who wants to argue that 'this sort of music' doesn't work\nin a live environment - give it up. There wasn'ta flat foot in the place. Go\ndirect your personal psychosis at the latest Spice Girl gone solo and her ilk.\nWho needs a choreographed dance routine and scantily clad men waving\ntheir arse s on the stage? Not me. So here I go...\nMarie\n\n"

However, cutbacks\nlead to his dismissal,\nand, jobless and home-less, he returned to Glasgow, where he went to\ncollege and began doing stand-up.\nInfluenced by the anti-censorship style of Alexei Sayle, Sadowitz embraced the freedom of\nstand up - the freedom to say anything. \"One\nday, I was standing up in my beds it like the\ndevil cursing the world. I remember saying:\n'This is it. I'm going to go out in this blaze of\nhurt. I'm going to take every nasty thought in\nmy head, every feeling and I am going to say\nas much of this as possible into a micro-phone.' It was almost like a fanatical\nrevenge.\"\nHis break came in 1985 when he was\nasked to headline London's Comedy Store.\nThis he did, travelling down from Glasgow\nevery fortnight for two years. Audiences liked\nhim, but the media and comedy promoters\nremained disinterested. \"What I was doing was\ngoing down really well and I was a headline\nact, but no agent would approach me. In retrospect it was probably because the material\nwas not of the politically correct variety\nenjoyed so immensely by the likes of Ben\nElton.\n\"I actually thought I was doing something\nto move comedy one step forward in a new\ndirection...putting comedy into a very open\nfield - women, left-wingers and ethnic minor i ties. I'm a big coward offstage, but onstage, to\nthe point of stupidity, I have no fear what so ev er. I went as far as I could go. I was dared to\ngo out on stage and say 'Nelson Mandela,\nwhat a cunt.' I 'll say it, but I need a joke to go\nwith it.\"\nRelocating to London, the promoter Malcolm Hardy became Sadowitz's manager.\nBookings increased and things were looking\nup. But this didn't last. Sadowitz had created a comedy character called Bing Hitler, and the\npotential of the creation was spotted by a no th\"... Tin a big\ncoward offstage,\nbut onstage, to the\npoint of stupidity, I have no fear...\"\ner comedian, Craig Ferguson, who produced\nan album of the same title, with similar mate-rial. According to Sadowitz, Ferguson admitted\nplagiarism and agreed to meet him with compensation money - but he didn't turn up. \"I think it is quite a thing that I am still here and\nstill sane. If I had to choose the saddest thing\nin the whole time I 've ever been doing this - it\nwas this time.\"\nNew frustrations arose. BBC2 had accepted Sadowitz's series,\nThe Pall Bearer's Review, \"I was proud\nof that. I scripted it,\npractically directed it.\nAlan Yentob was putting his arse on the\nline. Against all the\nsilly stories he may\nhave heard about me,\nhe still said: 'Give him\na series'\". But again,\nSadowitz's success\nwas scuppered. Yentob\nmoved to BBC1 and The\nPall Bearer's Revue was not re-commissioned.\nA James Bond parody with Channel Four met\na similar fate. \"It's not really Jerry being Jerry,\nis it? We want Jerry Sadowitz to be Jerry Sadowitz.\"\nThese disappointments and an acrimonious parting with Hardy, amid accusations of\nstolen earnings, culminated in Sadowitz quitting the comedy circuit: \"I couldn't bear it.\"\nEven now Sadowitz rarely watches television: \"Ida ren't because I 'll see material which is mine.\nI happened to switch on the TV and Hale and\nPace had started. The first fucking gag was\none of mine!\"\nDisillusioned, Sadowitz worked in a magic\nshop for four years and continued to invent\nmagic tricks. \"I ended up\nstaying at my mum's. It\nwas like a sad European film. I had one\nyear of sort of being\nhappy when I was 22\nand in the last couple\nof years because I 've\nbeen working and I'm being treated with a bit\nmore acknowledge-ment\".\n\"I have this philosophy in life which is\n'anything you want you\ncan get, but if you want it\ntoo much, you can't get it'. The two things I really wanted were, firstly, enough success with\ncomedy that I could get my own place. The\nother thing was women. I have been deeply\nunsuccessful with women. I regret not chatting\nthem up, not talking to them and not playing\nthe games that girls and boys play.\"\nSadowitz shuffles the pack of playing cards\nagain, fans them out and asks me to remove\n\"...rd have a huge tombstone.\nIt'll say 'fuck you\nand your fucking\nflowers'../'\none. \"You know, I might have studied physics\nor something. I would love to have found a cure for something.\" Suddenly a school boy\ngrin: \"You know...I 've got this manifesto of\nsexual communism which I would love to see\nimplemented, I really would. There isn't enough in it for women though. I definitely\nthink the world would be a much happier\nplace if men were being serviced more. \" He\nlaughs: \"I'm convinced!\" I place the card in\nthe pack in a different location; he shuffles the\ncards again and produces my card from the\ntop and smiles.\nBut what else does Sadowitz enjoy? \"I like\nall kinds of comedy. I adore Steve Martin's live\nstand up - he's fucking wonderful. Eddie\nIzzard, the Alan Partridge character - I think\nthat's brilliant.\" And Sadowitz loves classical\nmusic: Mahler, Chopin, Debussy and Delius\nare favourites. \"John Barry: he's my idol.\"\nJumping off his chair, Sadowitz disappears:\n\"I 've a photograph,\" he shouts. I'm shown\nSadowitz with his arm around Barry. \"I'm not\nhomosexual but I'd give him a blow job,\" he\nsaid, gazing at the picture. \"Genius. It's from\nGod,\" he murmured.\nHang on a minute, something doesn't quite fit - you believe in God? \"Oh yeah\nabsolutely. All religious texts are crap - they\nshould be put in the bin. Religion is a manmade thing, God isn't.\" Isn't genius a result of\n'increased' brain cell connections, I suggest-ed. \"No, it's God,\" Sadowitz replied.\nFrom God to his funeral - how will Jerry\nSadowitz say goodbye? Oddly, this question\nunleashes a surprising level of vitriol. \"I wouldn't want anyone to find out until a year\nlater - fuck 'em! There's no point in being\npassed over for everything you fucking do and\nthen suddenly everyone goes, 'Oh, Sadowitz is\ndead - really?' That would be a very typical\nthing that would happen to\nme. I'd have a huge\ntombstone. It'll say\n'fuck you and your\nfucking flowers. Go\nfuck yourself!'\"\n\"Can I get you\nanother coffee?\" Sadowitz shuffles the playing cards again and\nshows me another\ncard trick. I catch a gleam in his eyes and\nmaybe, just maybe, I can see the six year old\nSadowitz watching his\nfirst magic trick: \"It's escapism even today. I 've\nbeen homeless, but I 've always had cards on\nme. With them I am very happy and I can forget everything. It gives me great control.\nMaybe magic's the future for some sort of\nhappiness.\"\nJerry Sadowitz remains the only comedian to\nbe punched whilst onstage at the Montreal\nComedy Festival.\n\n"
