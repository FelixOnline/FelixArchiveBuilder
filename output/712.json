Carl Burgess and Dave\nKinston thus took direct and\nrapid action, basing their\ndecision on less than half the\nfacts.\n10. At no time has Indsoc\nobjected to the principle of\nits external bank account\nbeing monitored or audited.\nI am also disturbed by the\nallusions of mismanagement\nin your editorial and would\nlike to make clear a number\nof points:\n1. The Society's external\naccount is run along the\nsame union guidelines as our\nSCC account.\n2. The Union does indeed\nhave a duty to ensure that all\nclubs do look after their\nmoney properly. We can look\nforward to an effective and\nabsolutely efficient Union\nthis coming year if the whole\nUnion clubs' finances are\ngiven the same attention as\nours is receiving at present.\n3. I doubt that many societies\nhave a turnover as great as\nours simply because few\nother clubs organise nearly\nas many events during the\ny cv. To give some\nexamples\u2014speaker meetings,\nvisits to factories, business\ngames* a Careers Fair, a summer tour, a river cruise, a magazine and that was just\nlast ya er. In total we\norganised over 35 events last\nyear, s pea d over just two\nterms. Next year will be even\nbusier.\n4. From conversations I have\nhad with members of other\nsocieties, I understand that\nthey too have had difficulties\nwith Union accounts,\nparticularly Summer Tour\naccounts.\n5. Until 10th June, no-one\nhad been given any formal\nnotice that we would be\ndisciplined. There have been\nrumours, second-hand\ninformation, but no direct\napproaches and no\njustifications.\n6. The Union's action has\nbrought home to Indsoc the\nneed to establish\ncommunication between the\ntwo bodies.\nThe matter is now under full\ndiscussion and I hope that\nwe will soon be able to come\nto a permanent and\nappropriate solution to a diff iu lt problem.\nDavid J. Green\nChairman, Industrial Society\nRag Mag\nDisasters are always nasty\nthings, though for some\ninexplicable reason,\napparently more nasty and\ntragic if they are closer to\nhome (for outsiders that is,\nnot bereaved next of kin).\nAs explained at length in\nthe Editorial to the Rag Mag,\nmost humour and hence jokes\nare based on the misfortune\nof some person or animal\n(where they are not jokes\nabout ridiculous or impossible\nsituations), especially so when\nthey are topical. Most rag\nmags (including ours in the\npast) include one or two\ntopical jokes, often about\ndisasters such as airline\ncrashes, hotel bombings and\nso on. These may offend a few people, but on the whole,\nmore people find them\namusing because although\ntragic situations are not nice,\ntragedy does occur in life, and\nwe have to be able to laugh\nthings off and soldier on with\nlife. It is both difficult and\nunfair to pick on one set of\njokes and say that they are\nmore offensive than others,\n(to a particular set of people\nthey might be, but not to\nother, different people) and so\nthe exclusion of a particular\nset cannot be jus it if i ed \u2014if one\ngoes, they all go and there\nwould be no Rag Mag, and\ntherefore no income for Rag\nto distribute to people who\nsuffer from misfortunes, and\nare often forgotten and\npushed under the carpet.\nFuller reasons for the\ninclusion of jokes are given,\nas I said, in the Editorial to\nthe Rag Mag, which you will\nbe able to read in early\nSeptember, when the Rag\nMag will be available, but\nbasically thay are included to\nmake people think about\nsituations, and why they think\nthe jokes are funny. This is in\na hope that they will then\nrealise that what they are\ndoing is terrible, and want to\ndo something about the\nsituation.\nIf these jokes serve to keep\nthese ideas about how to\nprevent these tragedies\nhappening again alive in\npeople's minds, then they will\nhave served their purpose,\neven if they appear as just to\nbe in bad taste. When all the\nproblems of the world are\nsolved, then such humour will\nbecome meaningless, and I am eagerly awaiting that day.\nTony Spencer\nRag Mag Editor\nEditorial Note: The two letters\nprinted have been cut. We can\nnot guarantee that letters\npublished will not be edited.\nWe can not guarantee that\nletters will be published if they\narrive in the office later than\n1pm Monday.\nBBC\nPress freedom is crucial if a state is to be truly democratic.\nThe Press has a duty to\nquestion and challenge the\nSociety in which we live.\nHowever it also has a duty to\nbe responsible. The recent\ndecision by the Governors of\nthe BBC to ban the 'Real\nLives' interview with Sinn Fein\nwas not a responsible editorial\ndecision. It was a decision\nmade because of political\npressure by the government.\nHad the Governors made the\ndecision before Leon Brittan's appeal nobody would have\nconde med it as being\nanything other than a leg ti mate editorial decision.\nNow, though, comments\nabout the climate of public\nfeeling are only poor attempts\nby the Governors to justify\ntheir weakness in bowing to\npolitical pressure. Sinn Fein\nare a leg ti mate political party.\nGiving them access to TV and\nradio enables people to judge\ntheir arguments, something\nthat is essential in a free\nsociety. Hopefully most\nintelligent people will will see\nhow shallow Sinn Fein's beliefs are FELIX supports\nthe NUJ in it's campaign\nagainst the decision. If you\nfeel strongly about the\ndecision write to the\nGovernors of the BBC\nprotesting about the ban.\nRag Mag\nIt is disgusting for the\nsabbaticals to use, as they\nhave, the principle of editorial\nfreedom to defend the\ndecision to include jokes on\nthe Bradford City fire in the\nTony Spencer:\nthe Rag Mag\nThe Editor of\nRag Mag. It is almost an insult\nto BBC journalists. Editors\nmust always attempt to use\ntheir power responsibly. The\nBradford City fire was horrific.\nOver fifty people lost their\nlives in the disaster. I'm sure\nthe people of Bradford and\nLeeds are still exceptionally\nsensitive about the whole\nsubject. To risk adding to\ntheir sense of loss is\nextremely irresponsible.\nNothing is gained by\nincluding these jokes. Editors\ncan risk hurting people if, by\ndoing so, they do some good\nto others. The Union\nSabbaticals are elected to act\nas editors of the Rag Mag, the\nHandbook etc. It is an\naccepted part of their job. It is\nnot censorship for a senior to\nedit a junior's work. They are\nignoring their responsibilities\nwhen they claim they are\nprotecting Tony Spencer's editorial freedom.\nYou may be thinking that\nthis issue doesn't effect you.\nIt does.

That\nmeans people form their\nopinions of Imperial College\nand you by reading this\npublication.\nAccommodation\nStudent Services have asked\nme to tell you that\nac como dati on is still available\nin Garden Hall, Lexham\nGardens and Southside for\nthe rest of the summer.\nCredits\nThis issue would have been\nmuch naf fer without Nigel\nAtkinson, Kathy Tait, Tony\nChurchill, Sarah Kirk, Chris\nEdwards, Dave Clements,\nOligo, Tony Spencer, Judith\nHackney, Diane Love, Dave\nKingston and Alan Rose.\nFELIX would like to apologise\nto Mr Ian Bull for the\ncomments made in the last\neditorial. Everyone we talked\nto before that issue was\npublished had claimed that Mr\nBull was responsible for the\ndecision to purchase a boat.\nMr Simon Errington, ACC\nChairman, has now admitted\nto taking the decision to\npurchase the eight.

    "content": "GY>iG CD'I By now everyone should have\nrealised that August 1985 is\nthe 40th Anniversary of the\nHiroshma and Nagasaki\nAtomic bombings. To\nII commemorate this, there have\nbeen television\n\u2022 documentaries, radio shows,\ns newspaper articles - and\nbooks. The Postman of\nNagasaki is one of these.\nBy cent rating on how the\nterrible effects of a single\n(0.2mt on) atomic bomb nearly\nHI ruined an individual life, Peter\nTownsend emphasises a fact\nm that many world leaders, then\n1| and now, appear to forget;\nH that every single one of their\n:subjects matter, not just the\n;;1 uncomfortably bunker ed civil\nservants who 'deserve to\nsurvive'.\nAlthough Sumiteru, the 16\nyear old postman provides the\nm main biographical interest, the\ntragedy of many other victims\nand hi baku sha( survivors) is\nS used to underline the way that\nthe 'little people' were\nwant ingly destroyed. Apart\nfrom Sumiteru, who had all\nII the skin on his back flayed off\nM by the heat before being\ntossed to the ground by the\nH pressure wave, we are told of\nH the children who had waved\nH to him moments before who\nbecame 'small white shapes,\nH reminding him of leaves\nH scattered by an Autumn wind;'\nor the little girl, found by a; British POW, sitting still from\n\u2022 shock;...'she had appeared\nunhurt but...the other side of\nher small body was charred\nblack. Where her right eye\nI had been there remained only\na blank white cavity'.\nThe tales of the internal\npolitical machinations of\nWashington and Tokyo are\nI revealed, but not totally, one\nsuspects. The temptation to\nHsi mph stic ally portray Truman\nas a mono manic egotist has\nnot been avoided. The old\nargument that the dropping of\nthe first bomb at least, was\n: necessary, is rejected as a fall icy the President's two\nsenior military advisors\nappa rant ly tried to dissuade\nhim from the drop. Japanese\npeople are represented as the\ninnocent victims of two insane\ngovernments.\nThis book cannot make up\nits mind whether to be a documentary, a biography or\na condemnation, but skillfully\nmanages to be each in\ndifferent places, though the\ndearth of accurate statistical\ninformation lets down the\ndocumentary side a bit. Not\nrecommended for reading\nwhilst depressed or listening\nto Pink Floyds 'Final Cut', but\na must for anyone who wants\nto judge the nuclear arms\nquestion with anything like an\nunbiased view.\nMillennium\nJohn Varley\nMillennium by John Varley\n(Sphere \u00a31.95) appears in a silver jacket with a pretty\npic cy in a cut-out. All in all it\nlooks as big a hype as a book\ncan get. Do Not Be Deceived:\nthis is a good book, dealing\nwith the serious problems\ninvolved with time travel in a very intelligent way.It's told\nfrom two view points (mostly):\nthat of an aeroplane crash\ninvestigator, and that of a woman from a dismally\ndepressing future some 50,000\nyears ahead, who's been\nrescuing people from air and\nother disasters. The handling\nof time travel and the\nparadoxical situations is on\nthe whole intelligent, but with\nsome strange odd ment s thrown in like, a paradox\ntravels through time at a speed of 200 years per hour.\nThese all serve the plot well,\nthough, as the paradox which\nhas been created races into\nthe future to end a world that\nhad almost died out anyway.\nThe ending is somewhat\ndeus ex machina (almost\nliterally) but it all seems to fit\nin. I enjoyed it, and suggest\nyou ignore the cover and read\nit too.\nMillenium is available SFSoc\nlibrary, which is open every\nThursday lunchtime during\nthe term.\nFruits of Passion\nICA\nThe Fruits of Passion is a French/Japanese production\ndealing with obsession,\nabsolute love and solitude. It\nisn't exactly the best thing to\nwatch after a hard days work.\nThe story is of a beautiful\nFrench woman, O, who, due\nto a tortured upbringing, falls\nEven though a picture may\npaint a thousand words, the\nwritten form has been the\nmajor form of handing down\ninformation, especially of\nabstract ideas, even in recent\nhistory. As Scientists, we are\ntrained to observe and record\nbriefly and precisely. It can be\nfun, however, to write not\nfactually, but in im a gry. For\ninstance, this football match\nwas a World Cup qualifier in\nthe early 'seventies, between\nBrazil and a Scandanavian\nteam, and Pele had scored the\nbest goal I had ever seen.\n'Pele! Pele!', chanted the\nSantos crowd, as the master\norganises his team mates,\nconducting a Brazilian\norchestra of skill to strike at\nthe opposing defence. The\nfootball player was\nout ra gou sly flamboyant, but a delight to watch and the\neleven tormented Swedes\ncould only join the crowds\napplause. In\nacknowledgement to Pele,\nKing of football.\nOr how about this\ndi script ion of the final,\ndeciding bowl (inspired by\nDoug Armstrong playing Mark\nMaddison's Mum in Hyde\nPark) in a championship\nmatch.\nThe all-white of the players,\nreminiscent of pre-war\ncricketers, was vividly\ncontracted by the immaculate\ngreen. A cautious whisper of\nGood Luck showed that\nsportsmanship had survived\nthrough the worlds troubles as\nan age old idea in these age\nold bodies. The years of\nexperience guiding,\ncalculating the team, speed\nand trajectory of the bowl\nwhich spun and swerved,\nturning into the little target -now reached. It sighed heavily\nand slowed to a stop. Indeed\nthis was poetry in motion,\nperformed with the grace of\nprecision.\nIf you can come up with\nanything heavily-laced with\ndescriptive, imaginative terms,\nsend them via the FELIX\nOffice. It can be a long piece\nor just a phrase, eg. Michael\nRobinson (then Liverpool)\n'...was an elephant, playing in\na herd of gazelles...' Again a \u00a310.00 prize for best entry.\nPlease also note last issue\ncompetition is still open.\nin love with the sadistic Sir\nStephen (Klaus Kinski). He\ntests her love by making her\nagree to prostitute herself in a Chinese brothel and takes\ngreat pleasure in watching as\nshe is left at the mercy of all\ncomers. A sound performance\nfrom the French actress,\nIsabelle ll lier s as O and Peter\nas the Madame. However\nKlaus Kinski was\ndiss appointing failing to\nconvey the insecurity and\nmadness of Stephen. This\ncontrasts with the book\n'Return to the Chateau' on\nwhich the film was based. The\nfilm was confusing because\nthe audience is left wondering\nwhy Stephen is reduced to\nwatch O like a pornographic\npeep show. Stephen\neventually commits suicide\nwhen O falls in love with a young, communist\nrevolutionary. The film does\nhave some wonderful imagery\nin it but this sadly does not\ncompensate for the\nap paul ingly bad script.\nThe Fruits of Passion is a very arty film with English\nsubtitles and unlikely to\nappeal to the average IC\nstudent. It is erotica verging\non pornography but very\ntasteful. Perhaps a fellow critic\nsummed it up when she\nstormed out in the middle\nshouting 'How can you\nperverts watch this shit?'.\nWinston Tong\nICA\nWinston Tong has an amazing\nstage presence. Few\nperformers could sing along\nto backing tracks for almost\nan hour without moving and\nnot become boring. One\ncould criticise the quality of\nthe backing tracks, the\nirritating French accent that\nWinston Tong appears to\nadopt and several other small\npoints. To do so, though, is\nstupid. The evening was an\nexcel lant demonstration of\nquality singing and quality\nmusic.\nPage 4 Friday 9th August 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Congratulations Rosemary\nand John\nRag Mag:\nBad Taste?\nThe Imperial College Rag Mag\nwas used as an example of\nracism in British universities by\nthe Guardian. A joke from the\n1981-82 Rag Mag was used to\nstart the article which was a description of 'The pressures of\nbeing a black woman studying\nin the New Right's latest\nrecruiting ground: Britain's university campuses' that\nappeared on July 30th. The\narticle was written by Chinyelu\nOnwurah.\nMs Onwurah claims in her article\nthat 'Extreme nationalism is...far\ntoo fashionable.' She criticises\norganisations such as the\nLibertarian Alliance, a faction\nwithin the Federation of\nConservative Students, for\nadvocating the hanging of\nNelson Mandela and Arthur\nScargill. The attitude of this\ngroup to black people, she\nclaims, is blatantly racist.\nIn an interview with FELIX, Ms\nOnwurah said that she could not\nspeak for all black people at IC.\nShe all edged, though, that in her\nview the College establishment\nand the Union did not support\nblack students. She described\nthe atmosphere at IC as right\nwing and hence hostile to black\npeople at IC. The article, she\nsaid though, wasn't about IC but\nUniversities in general. Ms\nOnwurah said The South African\nbar night, the Royal School of\nMines Union attempted to\norganise last year, was an\nexample of racism at IC.\nUnion President, Carl Burgess,\nwrote to the Guardian saying\nthat he 'had never been\nsubjected to any form of racist\nactivity'. He told FELIX that he\nfound it incredible that someone\nwho had only studied at one\nuniversity for one year could\nwrite an article for a national\nnewspaper on racism in\nuniversities. He criticised Ms\nOnwurah for not contacting IC\nUnion about racism at IC.\nThe Guardian article\nThis year's Imperial College\nRag Mag will contain several\njokes about the Bradford City\nfire. The printers, Technoprint\n2000, have asked to have their\naddress removed from the\npublication because they fear\nthat being based in Leeds, they\nmay offend some of their\nneighbours who lost relatives in\nthe fire\nUnion sabbaticals have the\nright to edit the Rag Mag. They\nused this right to remove many\nof the racist jokes and all the\njokes about the famine in\nEthiopia..ICU President, Carl\nBurgess, told Rag Mag Editor,\nTony Spencer that he thought\nthe jokes about the fire were in\nbad taste. He advised Mr\nSpencer to remove the jokes. Mr\nSpencer phoned the printers\nwho said they would print the\njokes. Mr Spencer and Mr\nBurgess then agreed that the\njokes would remain in the Rag\nMag.\nMr Spencer has written to\nFELIX justifying his decision to\nprint the jokes. He claims that\n'We have to be able to laugh\nthings off and soldier on with\nlife'. He adds that the jokes are\nincluded To make people think\nabout the situations, and why\nthey think they are funny. This is\nin a hope that they will then\nrealise that what they are doing\nis terrible and want to do\nsomething about the situation'.\nThe Rag Mag will be on sale\nfrom the start of September.\n\u2022 Tony Spencer's letter and\neditorial comment on page 2.\nRosemary\nWeds\nRosemary Ivor-Jones, the FELIX\ntypesetter operator, married\nJohn Hosking last Saturday at\nSt.Leonards, Hythe.
