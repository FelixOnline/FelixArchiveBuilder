In other words, though you\nmay not know, not having ventured\noutside South Kensington since the\nsecond week of October, Santa is here!\nAnd what better way to spend your\nDecember money, freshly arrived\nfrom your parents, on presents for\nthe people you love, including the\naforementioned? Luckily for the\nuncreative, bored, lazy present buyers\namongst us (and that pretty much\naccounts for most of the student\npopulace, excluding that girl from\nhalls who bakes cupcakes on Saturday\nnight and does separate washes\nfor colours and delicates) stand-up\ncomedians come to the rescue.\nThis may be because they realise\nthat Christmas is the only time of\nyear they stand a chance of selling\na DVD as opposed to everyone\nstreaming their shows in neat\n10-minute parts on YouTube.\nNevertheless, these really make a\ngood present. And in addition are all\neasily bulk-bought from Amazon:\njust as long as you remember to do it\na couple of weeks before Christmas\nand have it delivered to your London\naddress before going home.\nFor a father and bread-winner of\nthe family, I would recommend Al\nMurray\u2019s new One Man, One Guvnor\nDVD, off The Pub Landlord series.\nThis comedy man may be slightly\npolitically incorrect towards women,\nmen, children, but he is also a\nsurprisingly lovable character, much\nlike everyone\u2019s old Pops. This year\u2019s\neffort is not as valiant as 2012\u2019s The\nOnly Way is Epic, but it\u2019s guaranteed\nthe same amount of laughs around\nthe tree.\nFor your favourite brother, Russell\nHoward has returned to theatres\nafter the hiatus to focus on his news\nshow Good News, with a brilliant\nshow. Wonderbox is a compendium of\nwhat makes Howard one of Britain\u2019s\nfavourite comedians. He is as sharp as\nhe is na\u00efve.\nHis observations, sometimes cruel\nsometimes innocent, will really speak\nto the lover of fart jokes inside us, but\nalso to the more serious part of the\nfamily. He is the quintessential good\nboy that my grandmother would love\nbut I could still bear to spend time\nwith.\nFor your less favourite brother, or\nthe friend from home who you hate\nbut somehow haven\u2019t yet disappeared\nfrom your lives, I suggest Jack\nWhitehall\u2019s Gets Around. For the\nparticularly annoying humoured\nsoul, Whitehall is perfect, with his\nunsubtle jokes about Jaeger Bombs\nand his unhealthy obsession about\nhis father. I realise Whitehall is quite\nsuccessful, which is why he features\nin the list, but personally I wouldn\u2019t\nbother unless the present is presented\nwith misery and resentment.\nYour sister will probably enjoy\nSarah Millican\u2019s Home Bird. See what\nI did there? That\u2019s not in any way\nbecause Millican is a woman and\nso only women can appreciate her\nhumour. Millican is someone who\neveryone can enjoy, approachable,\naffable and not as aggressive as many\nother comedians, she tricks you into a\nsense of calm like only your favourite\naunt can, and then says something\nfilthy that knocks you off the sofa.\nThis new DVD is as good as her\nprevious ones, if not better, and really\nneeds to be shared.\nFinally, for your mother, and this\nis only because out of the whole list of\n2014 Christmas releases, this was the\none that would make me cringe the\nleast if I had to watch it in the same\nroom as her, Jon Richardson\u2019s Nidiot.\nRichardson personally delivers my\nfavourite joke of the season, as well\nas making me feel less disappointed\nwith myself about never having\nbeen on a drinking holiday to Ibiza.\nPersonally one of my favourite\nefforts this Christmas.\nOn second thoughts, there\u2019s a joke\nabout masturbating under a tree. Be\naware of this and maybe buy your\nmother the last Downton Abbey (and\nthen escape from the house if she\ndecides to watch it).\nGIULIA GABRIELLI\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: atgtickets.com\nNow in its fifth season, the\ninternationally successful\nBritish series Downton\nAbbey is set to return to our screens\nfor another Christmas episode. The\nquality of the show has been varying\nover the past couple of years, with the\nmost recent seasons not quite living\nup to the high standards set by the\nearlier years. And yet Lord Julian\nFellowes gives his audience enough\nintrigue and character development\nto keep everything going nicely.\nThere is a reason why this show has\nbecome the most widely watched\ntelevision drama in the world. With\nthis Christmas episode the show has\nthe tough challenge of having to tie\nup loose ends set up by the preceding\neight episodes of season 5. So what are\nthe plot points worth looking forward\nto the most? Of course, watch out for\nspoilers \u2013 don\u2019t read unless you\u2019ve\nseen all the episodes on offer.\nChristmas at Downton Abbey \u2013 Year 5\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: visitlondon.com\nPhoto: twitter.com Photo: express.co.uk\nPhoto: reveal.co.uk Photo: vanityfair.com\nPhoto: pbs.org\nLady Mary's quest for love\nEver since the show started, it\nfocused heavily on finding a suitable\npartner for Lady Mary Crawley, the\neldest daughter of Lord and Lady\nGrantham (Hugh Bonneville and\nElizabeth McGovern, respectively).\nWith her husband\u2019s sudden death in\nthe third Christmas Special that sent\nfans into a frenzy, Lady Mary has\nsince recovered and also discovered\nher passion for sex outside of\nmarriage.\nSadly, things did not work out for\nher and this gentleman, but rumour\nhas it actor Matthew Goode has been\ncast to sweep Mary off her feet. Will\nshe finally be able to find happiness?\nOnly time will tell.\nRape, murder, more prison\ntime\nThe writers refuse to leave Mr John\nBates (Brendan Coyle) and Mrs Anna\nBates (Joanne Froggatt), the loveliest\ncouple the show has to offer, alone.\nThey have had their fair share of\ntroubles along the way, but the love\nthat binds the sweet couple together\nhas pushed them through this far.\nBut the season 5 finale saw the\npure-hearted Anna arrested for\nmurder of her rapist. She needs to be\nreleased as soon as possible for the\nsake of injecting some positive energy\ninto the show\u2019s narrative.\nAnd it would also be nice to close\nthe murder investigation and see who\nreally killed Mr Green.\nIllegitimate child in the 1920s\nLord Grantham was surprisingly\ncool about his second daughter\nEdith\u2019s (Laura Carmichael) big secret;\nthat she gave birth to a daughter with\nher suitor who disappeared then died\nbefore he could marry her.\nEdith is no longer sulking and\nlooking miserable thanks to having\nher daughter back at the Downton\nEstate, so we will surely get a lot less\nof her tiresome moaning, which is a\ngood thing.\nA potential departure\nThere are constant, unwelcome\nrumours of a cast member departing.\nTom Branson (Allen Leech) keeps\nharping on about going to America\nwith his daughter Sybbie, the\nDowager Countess Violet Grantham\n(Maggie Smith) is the go-to person to\npick on when guessing about who is\ngoing to leave. Tom can go, but the\nDowager Countess absolutely cannot.\nEven if her character is required to\ndie due to age, she needs to come back\nas a ghost or something, haunting the\ncorridors of Downton Abbey.\nLove is in the air?\nThere have been lots of hints\ndropped throughout this season\nthat Mr Carson (Jim Carter) and\nMrs Hughes (Phyllis Logan) would\neventually hook up. They are perfect\nfor one another, and personally, it\ncannot happen soon enough. How\nlong will they dilly-dally around just\nkeeping it a close friendship?\n\n"

Our team is investigating\nthe magnetic fields and features\naround Saturn and its moons. I\u2019ve got\n12 co-investigators and their postdocs\nworking on this, so I spend quite a lot\nof time coordinating what we do.\nSo what did you do on the way to\nSaturn?\nWe spent about four years\ntimetabling what we were going to\ndo when we got there! There are a\nhuge number of people who want\nto be taking readings of particular\nthings at particular times, and to\nsort out exactly how we were going to\nfit things in took some rather frank\nphone calls.\nWe also took the opportunity to\ncheck our instruments, so when\nperforming our fly-by of the Earth in\n1999 we deployed the magnetometer\nboom to check that everything was\nworking properly.\nIf you look at a photo of the\nspacecraft, you\u2019ll see a long boom\nsticking out of one side. The\nmagnetometer instruments are\nhoused at the end of that, and are kept\naway from the body of the spacecraft\nto ensure our readings are accurate.\nSo what\u2019s the outlook for the next\nfew years on your instrument and\nthe probe as a whole?\nWe\u2019ve been granted a mission\nextension to September 2017. At that\npoint, the radioisotope thermoelectric\ngenerator that powers the spacecraft\nwill no longer be able to power\nthings enough to maintain accurate\norientation and spacecraft control.\nAs with the Galileo spacecraft\norbiting Jupiter, we want to make\nsure that we don\u2019t contaminate any\nof Saturn\u2019s moons with debris or\nbacteria from Earth \u2013 so the end\nof the mission will involve flying\nstraight at Saturn and burning up in\nthe atmosphere.\nThat\u2019s quite a dramatic ending! It\nsounds like you\u2019ve all been kept\nquite busy, so what do you think\nthe greatest achievements of your\nteam and of the Cassini team as a\nwhole so far have been?\nWell, to be honest, I think they\u2019re\none and the same! A few years ago, we\ndiscovered water ice on Enceladus,\none of the moons of Saturn.\nObviously I like that discovery\nbecause it involved my team, but it\nalso made sure that everyone worked\nas a group, comparing data sets and\nlooking at exactly what was going on.\nThat really is quite an incredible\ndiscovery. So in the next four years,\nwhat new things are you looking to\ninvestigate?\nWell, the magnetometer team\nreally want to model all the different\ncurrents that are flowing in the Saturn\nregion. We don\u2019t understand the\nstructure of the planetary field, aren\u2019t\nsure why the magnetic dipole axis and\nthe rotation axis aren\u2019t aligned and\nwe\u2019d actually like to figure out how\nlong a day on Saturn is!\nWhat do you mean, figure out how\nlong a day is?\nIt\u2019s actually quite hard to figure out\nthe rotation period for a gas giant like\nSaturn! We can\u2019t look at fixed points\non the surface like we do on Earth,\nand the atmosphere is obviously not\nstatic.\nWe try to use radio emissions to\ndetermine day length, timing how\nlong it takes a particular source of\nradio emissions to complete one\nrotation.\nUnfortunately, the radio signals\nfrom Saturn aren\u2019t constant, they\nappear to change with time and\nseason, making things rather difficult\nfor us.\nI\u2019d never thought about that but it\nmakes sense. Some of that sounds\nlike quite a challenge, so what do\nyou think your biggest task will be\nin the coming years?\nWell personally my biggest\nchallenge will be convincing everyone\nelse to let us roll the spacecraft when\nwe get closer to the end of the mission.\nThe zero-level on our instruments\nchanges, so we need to make sure that\neverything is properly calibrated.\nWe wanted to do this by comparing\nthe readings from our magnetometer\n(built at Imperial) to that built at JPL\n\"We\ndiscovered\nwater ice on\nEnceladus,\none of the\nmoons of\nSaturn\"\nA decade\nof\ndiscovery\n\n"

It\nnow is printed roughly once a term,\nand contains poems, short stories,\npictures and photographs to show\nthat, for a STEM university, we are\nactually quite arty too. Thanks so\nmuch to Matt Allinson, and my Arts\nteam who helped put this majestic\n24-page piece together.\nIn news this week we have the\nfallout from a staggeringly long (3\nhour!) Union council meeting on\nTuesday. The debate over how a\nstudent volunteer should act, what\ntheir role should really involve and\nhow this is communicated between\nthe Union and club officers was long\nand thorough.\nIt seemed to resonate through the\nCouncil when one supporter of the\nCaptain mentioned that Hobson is\npurely a student, and is doing the role\nbecause he enjoys it and was voted in.\nPersonally, I thought it seemed\nuncomfortable to usurp him from\nhis role, as enthusiastic volunteers\nare the backbone of the Union; they\ncan also seem few and far between\nat times. Felix is run completely by\nvolunteers who work with me to make\na paper week on week, and although\nI\u2019m paid if my section editors, copy\neditors, photographers and writers\ndecided not to come in one week, no\ndoubt there would be no paper.\nI hope this incident highlights\nthe need for further dialogue\nbetween clubs and societies and their\nvolunteers, as the Union isn\u2019t really\nthere to just scold students.\nThe Union is there to look out for\nstudents: not mentioned in news\nthis week but still worth a mention\nhere is that Alex Savell, Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services)\nis now campaigning to reduce the\ncharges international students pay\nfor transactions to the College. This\nbrings us nicely in a circle to the\nstart of the year when the Union was\ncampaigning to stop the introduction\nof NHS fees for international\nstudents too.\nWe pretend we hate the Union\nsometimes at Felix, mostly because\nit annoys the overlords and it makes\nus laugh in the office when we take\nthe piss. In reality, we have realised\nthis year that we are pretty lucky to\nfunction as a publication in the way\nthat we do. We\u2019ve heard of papers\nbeing pulled by Unions, or Unions\ndemanding that they read the paper\nbefore print, something Felix has\nbeen lucky to avoid.\nDoes the union manage to\novercome College\u2019s apparent \u201cmoneymaking\u201d schemes? Not often. They\nalso seem to think a campaign is\nsolely driven by hash tags and cyan\nand magenta leaflets, but they do\nmean well.\nSo we would like to thank the\nUnion for not fucking us over this\nyear.

Photo: NASA/Cassini\n[Jet Propulsion Laboratory] over in\nthe US, but unfortunately the other\none stopped working a number of\nyears ago. Now, the only way to\ncalibrate the instrument is to roll the\nspacecraft on two separate axes.\nAnd what happens then?\nWe\u2019re going to perform a close\ngravity assist of Titan and then launch\nourselves into an orbit that takes up\nthrough the ring plane. We\u2019ll only be\nabout 7000km above the top of the\nclouds then, so we\u2019ll have to rotate\nthe spacecraft as well such that the\nhigh-gain antenna, the big white disk,\nis leading. This is to make sure that\nif we hit any energetic dust particles\nthey put holes in the antenna and not\nin the instruments!\nOnce that\u2019s done, we\u2019ll complete\n22 orbits inside the rings. On the last\nfive orbits, lasting six days each, we\nexpect to have lost attitude control on\nthe spacecraft and it will be tumbling.\nI want to be out at the control room\nwhen it all ends.\nIt\u2019s quite sad in a way that the\nmissions end like that. I remember\nwhen Galileo ended in 2003.\nNonetheless it\u2019s quite impressive\nthat the spacecraft has lasted this\nlong!\nYes, but the spacecraft is getting old\nnow.

The\nslight delay in release dates between the US and the UK\nmeant that we began the year with a spate of Academy\nAward nominees \u2013 and eventual winners \u2013 including Steve\nMcQueen\u2019s 12 Years A Slave, Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Wolf of\nWall Street, and Spike Jonze\u2019s Her. To many it seemed like\nthe year had peaked too early, and that nothing would live\nup to the films released in these first couple of months;\nthey were wrong.\nIn particular 2014 was a year of return for a number\nof directors who had been absent for a while; the Coen\nbrothers delighted with their sharp, pithy film Inside\nLlewyn Davis, which was centred around the Greenwich\nVillage folk scene of the 1960s; Mike Leigh made a\nwelcome return to the screen after a four year absence\nwith his biopic Mr Turner, in which Timothy Spall gave a\nperformance of a lifetime as the seminal British painter,\npicking up a Best Actor award at Cannes; and Wes\nAnderson brought his trademark symmetry back into the\ncinema with The Grand Budapest Hotel, a snappy candybox\nof a film that featured a procession of celebrity cameos\nand taught us that Ralph Fiennes was actually extremely\nfunny. Not to forget Joanna Hogg\u2019s Exhibition, in which the\nbreakdown of a relationship is explored in an unsettlingly\nsurreal manner.\nAnd it was not the UK/US film industries that proved\nsuccessful this year. Pawel Paw\u0142ikowski\u2019s Ida was an\nunforeseen masterpiece; with its monochromatic palette,\njazzy soundtrack, and idiosyncratic framing style, it was\nlike watching Poland through a Nouvelle Vague lens. From\nacross the channel we had the Dardenne brother\u2019s Two\nDays, One Night, in which Marion Cotillard cemented\nher reputation as a jewel in French cinema\u2019s crown, and\nStranger By The Lake, a shimmering, Hitchcockian mirage\nof a film that blended horror and homoeroticism.\nBut the main showdown this year took place between\ntwo diametrically opposite films, perhaps representing\nthe head and the heart. On the side of the heart we had\nBoyhood, Richard Linklater\u2019s epic tale of a boy\u2019s childhood\nand adolescence; filmed over a period of twelve years,\nit seemed both as intimate as a whispered secret and as\nbroad as a Texan sky. Watching Mason grow up in front\nof our very eyes, from queuing up at a Harry Potter book\nlaunch to drinking his first beer, Boyhood acts both as\na celebration of youth and a clear-eyed reminder of a\nchildhood past.\nHowever good Boyhood may have been, for me it was just\nbeaten by the British sci-fi film Under the Skin, in which\nJonathan Glazer had Scarlett Johansson wander around\nScotland as an extra-terrestrial. With an almost clinical\nlogic to it, Under the Skin is as cold and unforgiving as deep\nspace; from its visuals, to its camerawork, to the acting\ntalent, Under the Skin is nothing short of a masterpiece,\nnot to mention its breathtaking, brutal soundtrack from\ncomposer Mica Levi. A brilliant exploration of alienation,\nmodern isolation, and the folly of humanity, Under the\nSkin absolutely captivates, dragging you down into its icy\ndepths.\n7.

The plot is\nsimple enough; the council already\noperates on minimum budget, and by\ncutting funding they can no longer\nprovide the services their area needs.\nEach cut they make has a direct\nconsequence; closure of childcare in\na predominantly Muslim area causes\nclashes and EDL rallies. Reduction of\nstreet lighting leads to an increase of\nviolent crime. As the play progresses\nthe meeting between council leader\nHilary (Stella Gonet) and her deputy\nMark (Paul Higgins from The Thick\nof It) become increasingly desperate,\nas the impossibility of their task\nbecomes increasingly apparent.\nThorne manages to keep the story\nreal: despite the clear message, Hope\navoids becoming a 21st\ncentury\ncautionary tale. The fly-on-the-wall effect is very strong, with each\nnew event managing to appear as a\nnatural, realistic progression rather\nthan moralistic point-scoring. This is\nhelped by the fact that each character\nhas a very different input to the\nproblem: the pro-protest, joint-smoking councillor from the 80s; the\nduty-driven council leader Hilary; the\nmutinous but na\u00efve young councillor\nSarwan; and the deputy leader Mark,\nwho sees the budget cut decisions as\na personal, difficult responsibility\nrather than an unpleasant political\ndecision. The characters stick to\ntheir belief, without their different\nsolutions being resolved into a clear\nmessage. The play does not have a\nsolution to the budget cuts we are\nliving through, but it offers a way\nof dealing with them: hope. Hope\nfor a better future, hope that people\nwill make the right choices and hope\nthat those choices will translate into\npositive change. Mark\u2019s clever, funny\nteenage son Jake embodies this hope\nwith his witty, insightful comments.\nAfter a national level scandal\ncaused by their decision to close\nthe adult day-care centre, Mark\nand Sarwan decide to be the first\ncouncil in Britain to refuse the\nbudget they\u2019ve been set. In an act of\ndefiance towards central government,\nthey hope to show the world that,\nat local level, the austerity which is\nbeing imposed on them is harmful.\nThe abstract number sent to them\nby the government translates to\na dramatically diminishing in\nthe quality of life for the neediest\namongst us. It\u2019s a very powerful\nmessage; we cannot do what is being\nasked of us. But their protests fall flat,\nas popular outcry against the shirking\ncouncil means that their decision\nlacks the all important media\nsupport.\nThe overwhelming feeling of urgent\nneed for political change that Hope\nconveys is elating. It is a left-wing call\nto arms against the savage austerity\nwe\u2019re living through, but also a very\nfunny piece on very real people.\nYes, my soul was stirred toward\nrighteous revolt against the absurd\nTory policies we\u2019re subjected to \u2013 but\nnot so much that I couldn\u2019t have a\ngood laugh at the awkward father-son sex talks between Mark and Jake.\nPolitical poignancy does not exclude\nentertainment, as many politicians\nshould learn.\nAs the on-stage calendar flips to the\ncurrent date, Jake tells the nostalgic\nex-Labour leader \u201cit\u2019s possible I\nwill have a better life than you. It\u2019s\npossible the world will be better. Just\nso you know.\u201d That\u2019s what we all\nthink, and that\u2019s why we must have\nhope in the future.\nHope is on at The Royal Court until\n10th\nJan 2015.

Scientists from the\nUniversity of Huddersfield\nhave developed a new drug that\ncould reduce the side effects of binge\ndrinking. The compound, called\nethane-beta-sultam, is a taurine \u2018prodrug\u2019 that can easily enter the blood\nstream before being processed by the\nbody. Professor Mike Page, Dr Karl\nHemming and colleagues believe that\ntaking the drug during a heavy night\nof drinking will prevent alcohol from\ndamaging the brain.\nThe study, published in the Journal\nof Alcoholism and Drug Dependence,\ninvolved scientists administering\nethane-beta-sultam to rats on a\nbinge-drinking regime. Usually, high\nlevels of alcohol impair the brain by\ninducing inflammation and cell loss.\nHowever, these effects were reduced\nin mice that had been given the drug.\nEthane-beta-sultam works by\nreducing the number of excess\nglial cells that the brain produces.\nTaking it when drinking high levels\nof alcohol can prevent the death of\nbrain cells that are important for\nnavigation and orientation.\nBinge drinking can lead to\nmemory loss and long-term damage\nof the brain, especially in teenagers,\nwhose brains are still developing.\nConsuming 6 units of alcohol for\nwomen, or 8 units for men (4 glasses\nof white wine or 3.5 pints of lager) is\nconsidered as having a binge.\nEthane-beta-sultam is a\nbreakthrough compound as it\novercomes a major obstacle in the\ntreatment of neurological conditions.\nThe drug is capable of crossing the\nblood-brain barrier. This serves as the\nbody\u2019s mechanism to shield the brain\nfrom toxic compounds, but makes it\ndifficult to deliver medication to the\nbrain.\nThere is likely to be controversy\nif ethane-beta-sultam is approved,\nas there are fears it could lead to an\nincrease in binge drinking. Despite\nshielding the brain, the drug offers\nno protection to the rest of the\nbody, such as the liver. Prescribing\nethane-beta-sultam may also fail to\ntackle deeper issues, such as alcohol-dependence. However, Professor Page\nbelieves it could help to lessen the\ndamage that alcoholics do to their\nbrains whilst they try to quit, saying:\n\u2018If you accept that alcohol abuse is\ngoing to continue, then it might be\nsensible for society to try and treat it\nin some way.\u2019\nThe drug\u2019s has been part of a\n10 year collaboration between 11\nscientists across the UK, Belgium\nand Italy. Research is ongoing in the\nhope that compounds even better\nthan ethane-beta-sultam could be\nproduced. It is possible that with\nfurther development, similar drugs\ncould be used to treat a range of\nneurological conditions such as\nDementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A new drug could reduce the impact of alcohol on the brain.

For those\nof you who are unsure, algae\nare oxygen photosynthetic organisms\nthat form plant-like structures in\nfreshwater or marine ecosystems. But\ncould it be possible for a plant to fuel\nup your car and get you back home\nfor the Christmas holidays?\nThe answer is yes: turn them into\nbiofuels, a type of renewable energy\nmade by or from a living organism.\nAs we all know, fossil fuels are\nstarting to run out, so to address the\npotential energy shortage we have to\nturn to other renewable sources of\nenergy.\nThis is where the biofuels come in.\nThe most important advantage that\nbiofuels give instead of fossil fuels\nis that they can be produced within\na small period of time and not in\nmillions of years, which means they\ncan be a potential immediate source\nof energy.\nTheir production could stimulate\nthe economy since they can increase\nemployability in rural areas. This\nspreads wealth, as the main people\ninvolved with that will be farmers\nand scientists and not entrepreneurs.\nIn terms of the ecological impact,\nbiofuels, when taken from plants, can\ntheoretically reduce the greenhouse\neffect since they absorb carbon\ndioxide (CO2) for the purpose of\nphotosynthesis and produce oxygen,\nmaking them a carbon neutral fuel.\nHowever, this is not the case in\npractice since fertilizers are required\nfor their growth, which are made\nusing fossil fuels.\nThe main disadvantage of biofuels\ntaken from crops, is that these crops\ncould have been used to feed people.\nAlso especially when using ethanol as\na biofuel, huge amounts are required\nto produce the same amount of\nenergy as fossil fuels do, something\nthat actually creates an energy loss.\nMicroalgae, another source of\nbiodiesel, are cultivated for the oil\nthey produce which then is extracted\nand after several modifications can be\nused as an actual fuel. Algae however,\novercome the disadvantages of\nconventional biofuels, because they\ncan produce far more energy, and\ndon\u2019t take up land used to grow food.\nFurthermore, algae can grow\nin salt water, freshwater or even\ncontaminated water: something that\nwould solve the issue of the land\nrequired for cultivation. And the\nmore CO2 algae take up, the more oil\ncan be produced.\nResearchers working on how to\nincrease the yield production of algae\nhave possibly discovered a \u2018cellular\nbutton\u2019 that except from increasing\nthe oil production in algae can give\nthem a better understanding of\ncellular regulation which can be very\nhelpful for cancer research.\nAlgae may prove to be the organism\nthat can save us all. Apart from\nthe advantages it shares with all\nrenewable energy sources, it also\novercomes many of the disadvantages\nassociated with conventional biofuels.\nAlgae could be used to produce renewable energy without the negative\nimpacts of conventional biofuels Photo: Creative Commons\n\n"

Paul Beaumont,\nCouncil Chair, abstained but Tom\nWheeler, the Union President, did get\nto vote on the motion.\nThe motion was proposed as one of\nthe sanctions set by the Governance\nSub-Committee a few weeks ago,\nas punishments for members of\nthe team seen stripping on tube\nplatforms and causing a disruption to\nthe tube service at the end of October.\nMany members of the ACC\ncommittee, sports teams and other\nclub captains attended the meeting in\na show of support to Hobson. They sat\nthrough an hour of debate concerning\nother motions before reaching the\npaper, submitted by Union President\nThomas Wheeler, proposing the\nmotion of no confidence.\nThe paper was not circulated online,\nso was not open for any student to\nsee, but detailed how Hobson lied on\nthree counts during the investigation\ninto ICURFC. Wheeler told Council\nhow Hobson lied about how many\nstudents were naked on the tube\nduring the incident, if they were fully\nnaked and if there was any alcohol\nconsumed.\nIn a statement to Council, Hobson\nsaid that he deeply regretted what\nhad happened, and outlined how\n\u201cmisunderstandings\u201d between the\nUnion and the club itself did not aid\nthe investigation after the incident.\nSaid Hobson \u201cI just thought the\nUnion is here to deal out punishment,\nand I now know it is there to help\nclubs.\n\u201cI do this role because I love the\nrugby club, I\u2019m not doing this for any\nsort of CV points, and I would hate to\nstop being the Club Captain.\u201d\nWhen asked as to why he lied,\nHobson said he was trying to protect\nthe club, and was wary of how other\nRugby clubs such as those at London\nSchool Economics (LSE) had been\nCouncil votes against motion of No\nConfidence for Rubgy Club Captain\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\ndisbanded after incidents in the past.\nSaid Hobson, \u201cI tried to protect my\nmembers and the people there at the\ntime [of the incident]. I was doing it\nwith what I thought was my members\nand club\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d\nThese lies were told to the Union,\nwho then relayed them to the British\nTransport Police (BTP). When the\nBTP told the Union they had CCTV\nevidence to the contrary, the lies\n\u201cmade [the Union] look like idiots.\u201d\nWheeler also clarified that the Union\nis still unaware of the identities of the\nindividuals involved.\nThe four individuals are still in\ntalks with the police and have a\ncollege disciplinary hearing this\nafternoon.\nThe debate that then followed\nlasted for over an hour, and involved\nboth members of council and those\nwho had showed to support Hobson,\ndespite only those on Council being\nable to vote for or against the motion.\nThere was a lot of discussion about\nthe potential to issue a censure\nagainst Hobson instead. A censure\ninvolves a formal warning against\nthe behaviour. However, due to\nthe Union Constitution, this takes\nfive full college days so could not\nbe introduced during the council\nmeeting or added to the motion as an\namendment.\nWheeler also explained as to why\nthe censure wasn\u2019t added in his\npaper in the first place, stating that\n\u201cWriting it down would have made\nit look like I was going after Tom\n[Hobson], and I have tried my upmost\nto remove anything that makes it\nlook like this is a personal attack.\u201d\nDebate also covered what effect\nremoving Hobson would have on the\nfunctioning of the Rugby club as a\nwhole, and also addressed the wider\nissues of the remits of volunteers,\ntheir roles in the Union and also\nhow the club had already received\npunishment.\nOne supporter of Hobson pointed\nout that there was no other student\nwilling or capable of taking up the\nrole should Hobson be forced to step\ndown. \u201cWe can\u2019t think of another\nman who would step up, and we will\ndefinitely be faced with turmoil for\nthe club as a whole in the future.\u201d\nSaid another supporter of Hobson,\n\u201cThe opinion of the rugby club as\nto who should run the rugby club is\nmore important than that of anyone\nelse.\u201d\nOthers discussed how the Athletic\nClubs Committee had already voted\nunanimously to keep Hobson in\nhis position, and how their online\npetition had amassed a further\n600 approved signatures. Despite\n\u201cgrilling\u201d Hobson on what happened\nduring their own meeting, they\nstill decided that he should not be\nremoved from his role.\nAlthough these votes had no power\nin Council, students pointed out that\nit showed that ACC was happy to keep\nHobson in his position too.\nMembers of Council were keen to\nconsider what sort of message passing\nor voting against the motion would\nsend to other clubs and societies.\nSaid one attendee, \u201cA vote of no\nconfidence would send the message\nthat a breach of trust [between the\nUnion and the club captain] cannot\noccur and would not be tolerated,\u201d\nbut another student was quick to\npoint out that Hobson, as a volunteer,\nis not paid to fulfil his role and is\ninstead elected by his peers. Another\nmember continued, \u201cThe impact of\nhis removal will not be beneficial to\nthe club, and that seems unfair.\u201d\nAfter around an hour of debate,\nthe council was directed to vote using\npaper ballots to allow them to vote\nwithout others knowing how they\nwere voting. When the results were\nannounced, those who had turned up\nto support Hobson cheered.\nThomas Hobson also spoke to us\nafter the meeting. He told Felix: \u201cI\nwould like to thank everyone for\ntheir support throughout this ordeal\nwhether it be signing the petition or\nturning up on the night, it has made\nthis easy to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cI am looking forward to working\nwith the union to help improve their\nrelationship with clubs and to try\nand stop a similar incident from\nhappening again.\u201d\nWheeler also spoke to Felix about\nthe motion. Said Wheeler: \u201cI was\nrecommended to bring this Motion\nof No Confidence to Council, by the\nUnion\u2019s Governance Committee as\nit is Council\u2019s wish to make decisions\nregarding Officer Confidence.\u201d\n\u201cThe discussion that followed was\nvery insightful, fair and constructive,\nproving that Council is the\nappropriate body to make decisions\nconcerning Club Officers.\u201d\n\u201cIt was imperative that the\nrepresentative role that Council has\nwas utilised during this decision\nmaking process. The discussions\nshowed that the actions of a few affect\na large proportion of the rest of our\nmembership.\u201d\n\u201cI fully support Council\u2019s decision.\u201d\nThe Chair of ACC, Oliver Benton,\nsaid to Felix: \u201cThe ACC welcomes the\ndecision to not remove Tom Hobson\nfrom his position as Club Captain.\u201d\n\u201cA key point of discussion at\nCouncil was the lack of understanding\nby clubs of the Union's role in these\nsituations.:\n\u201cTom has already expressed interest\nin working with us to ensure that the\nlessons learnt can be shared with the\nwhole ACC so that everyone is aware\nof the Union's role in supporting\nclubs through difficult situations.\u201d\n\u201cHe has also pledged full\ninvolvement in ACC's drive to shift\nsports culture away from excessive\nalcohol consumption; as he remains\nin office he will be much more able to\neffect this change.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully we are close to drawing\na line under the whole situation so\nthat we can all go back to doing what\nwe love: playing sport.\u201d\nPhoto: Stephen Ball\n\"I do\nthis role\nbecause I\nlove the\nrugby club,\nI'm not\ndoing this\nfor any\nsort of CV\npoints\"\n\"Despite\n\"grilling\"\nHobson\non what\nhappened\nduring\ntheir own\nmeeting,\nthey still\ndecided\nthat he\nshould not\nbe removed\nfrom his\nrole.\"\n\n"

Owned by the\ngallery since 1991, it has been shown\nin every space the gallery has moved\nto, with its current iteration taking up\nthe entire basement of their building\njust off Sloane Square.\nJust like the Saatchi Gallery, the\nTate Foundation has its own dark\nconnection to oil; yet their river of\ncrude trickles down much further\nthan the basement, reaching down\ninto the core of the institution. I\nam, of course, talking about the link\nbetween The Tate Foundation and\ntheir longest-running sponsors, the\noil giant BP. Their sponsorship deal\nis no secret. Indeed, BP seems to have\nobtained quite a lot of PR mileage\nfrom the relationship, with an\nestimated 30 million visitors to the\nTate exposed to their sprightly green\n& yellow logo, and have expanded\ninto sponsoring a number of other\nBritish artistic institutions, including\nThe British Museum, National\nPortrait Gallery, National Theatre,\nRoyal Opera House, and Almeida\nTheatre. But if you dig a little deeper\nit seems that there are some things\nthat BP would rather keep quiet.\nIn July 2011, the Tate\u2019s Ethics\nCommittee, which includes artists\nWolfgang Tillmans and Jeremy\nDeller, recommended that their\nsponsorship deal with BP continue.\nIn December it was announced\nthat BP would support a number\nof institutions \u2013 including the\nTate \u2013 to the tune of \u00a310 million;\nshortly afterwards a petition\nnumbering 8,000 signatures was\ndelivered to director Nicholas\nSerota, demanding that the Tate\nFoundation immediately sever ties\nwith BP, largely due to their impact\non the environment. It was the\nlargest outcry since their relationship\nbegan in 1990. The management\nsat on the petition for a total of ten\ndays before giving the trustees less\nthan 24 hours in which to express\nconcerns before the matter was\ndropped. This signalled the start of\na lengthy court battle lasting three\nyears, the outcome of which was that\nthe Tate Foundation was ordered by\nthe Information Commissioner to\ncomply to a number of Freedom of\nInformation requests regarding what\nwas discussed in their meetings with\nBP. The Tate Foundation has since\nappealed the decision, having signed a\nconfidentiality agreement with BP in\nDecember 2011.\nThis incident marked the final\nstraw in a long line of indiscretions\nfrom BP for many, including pressure\ngroup Liberate Tate, founded in 2010\nto highlight the ethical problems\nposed by the relationship through\na combination of activism and\nperformance art. Thus far, their\nprotests have included Floe Piece\n(Jan 2012), in which a piece of ice\nwas transported from the arctic and\nallowed to melt in the turbine hall,\nThe Gift (July 2012), which saw a\ngroup of activists transport a wind\nturbine blade into the Tate Modern\nto campaign for increased renewable\nenergy investment, and Human Cost\n(April 2011), during which an activist\nwas stripped naked and covered in\noil in the centre of Tate Britain. And\nthey are not alone. Other collectives\nsuch as Art Not Oil, Platform, and\nTo BP or Not To BP have all sprung\nup over the last decade, opposing\nsponsorship of artistic institutions by\noil companies.\nSo why is this a problem? Well, for\nstarters the record that BP has on\nenvironmental issues is far from rosy.\nOne only needs to go back to 20th\nApril 2010, the day oil began seeping\ninto the Gulf of Mexico following an\nexplosion on the Deepwater Horizon\nrig, to discover the impact BP has on\nthe natural world. Over the next five\nmonths around 5 million barrels of\noil leaked into the ocean, decimating\nthe marine life in the area, perhaps\npermanently. While the well was\ndeclared sealed on 19th\nSeptember\n2010, there are some reports that\nstate the well continues to leak. What\nwas once described by the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Association\nas \u201cone of the most productive ocean\necosystems in the world\u201d has now\nbeen forever altered; in some areas\nup to 50% of fish are swimming with\nopen sores; during the first birthing\nseason post-spill, the number of\ndead baby dolphins washing up on\nMississippi and Alabama beaches\nincreased ten-fold; and in 2013 NASA\nstated that there was a \u201cdearth of\nmarine life\u201d in the area.\nNot only has the spill affected the\narea\u2019s ecosystem, but the lives of the\ninhabitants have also been altered.\nIn the initial explosion 11 workers\ndied, and since then the long-term\neffects of oil exposure on clean-up\nworkers has begun to manifest, no\ndoubt thanks to the fact that they\nwere denied respiratory protection\nand threatened with dismissal if\nthey complained. Furthermore,\nmany workers did not receive safety\ntraining to use clean-up chemical\nCorexit, a legal requirement. Medical\nprofessionals are still reporting cases\nof health problems in local residents,\nwith leading doctors predicting that\n\u201cliver and kidney disease, mental\nhealth disorders, and developmental\ndisorders should all be expected\u201d.\nTony Hayward, BP\u2019s CEO at the time,\ntried to play down concerns, saying\nthat the spill was \u201cvery, very modest\u201d\ncompared to the size of the ocean. He\nalso sympathised with local residents\nsaying that he too \u201cwanted my life\nback\u201d; this is cold comfort for the\npopulation, who are still experiencing\ndisturbances to their health. One\nstudy in particular found that a third\nof children living less than 10 miles\nfrom the Louisiana and Florida coast\nhad experienced unexplained health\nproblems, including bleeding from\nthe ears and nose.\nIn fairness to BP, the case could be\nmade that Deepwater Horizon was\nan isolated incident, which no-one\ncould have predicted. The same\nargument is difficult to make for\nShell, another oil conglomerate that\nruns significant sponsorship deals in\nthe UK, including with The National\nGallery. Their activities in the\nNiger Delta, where they turned the\ngovernment against the Ogoni people,\non whose land they were working,\ncan only be described as horrific.\nFollowing complaints by local elders\nthat they were being exploited,\nShell suspended all activity in the\narea; soon afterwards paramilitary\ntroops raided the villages under\norders from the government, and\nShell resumed their drilling. The\nconflict reached a peak in 1995 with\nthe execution of activist Ken SaroWiwa, who was accused of murdering\nfour Ogoni chiefs. Immediately\nafterward Nigeria was suspended\n\"A petition\nof 8,000\nsignatures\ndemanded\nthat the\nTate sever\nties with BP\"\n\"Deepwater\nHorizon\nforever\naltered\nthe local\nmarine\necosystem\"\nProtestors from Liberate Tate at the BP Summer Party celebrating 20 years of BP sponsorship, 2010 Photo:\nImmo Klink\nDirty Money:\nWhat are\nthe Ethical\nImplications\nof Artistic\nInstitutions\naccepting\nMoney from Oil\nCompanies?\nAn Analysis by\nFred Fyles\n\n"

The motion, which was\nvoted for by a simple majority of\nstudents, failed to pass as it did not\nreach the 75% majority necessary\nto modify UCLU\u2019s governing\ndocuments.\nA General Assembly is equivalent\nto an ICU General Meeting, where\neveryone is entitled to vote. Unlike\nICU, UCLU have General Assemblies\nfairly regularly. This particular one\nwas followed by a social.\nThe motion proposed to cut the\nnumber of sabbatical officers as a\nmeans to cutting UCLU\u2019s deficit,\nwhich is running into the region of\nhundreds of thousands of pounds.\nThe motion in question, called\n\u201cAmendment 3\u201d proposed for a\nconversion of UCLUs structure\nto have six sabbatical officers \u2013\n\u201cActivities & Events\u201d, \u201cEthics,\nProposal to cut 10 sabbaticals down to 6 at UCL falls through\nEnvironment & Operations Officer\u201d,\n\u201cWelfare and Communities Officer\u201d,\n\u201cBME and International Students\nOfficer\u201d, \u201cEducation, Democracy\n& Communications Officer\u201d, and\n\u201cPostgraduate Students and Medical\nStudents Officer\u201d.\nThe changes were proposed to\nsave nearly \u00a3160,000 in salaries and\nassociated costs, although costs from\nreducing the number of support staff\nwere not included.\nThe overall result on the vote\nwas 304 for, 225 against, and 10\nabstentions.\nThe rejection of the motion has\ncaused some controversy; with some\ncomplaining that the rejection of the\nmotion showed that UCLU was \u201coutof-touch\u201d. One student vowed that\nthe campaign to cut the number of\nsabs \u201cwill be back\u201d.\nFollowing the rejection of the\npaper, a motion was passed to\nadjourn the meeting. Hannah\nSketchley, the UCLU Democracy\nand Communications Officer\ndescribed the decision as \u201cunwise\nand undemocratic\u201d, with it being\na \u201cmassive shame not to hear the\nmotions of other people who had\nworked so hard on their campaigns\u201d.\nBecause of this, a fourth proposal\nby the sabbatical team involving the\nremoval of one sabbatical officer was\nnot considered.\nBoth motions would have increased\nthe number of executive officers,\nsimilar to ICU\u2019s liberation officers.\nOne of the changes in Amendment\n3 involved the elimination of the\nWomen\u2019s Officer.\nIn an article that incumbent Annie\nTidbury wrote for the Telegraph\nwebsite, she argued the proposal\nignored the \u201clong-term implications\nfor students\u201d. The proposals\nreplace the position with a \u201cGender\nEqualities Officer\u201d.\nShe noted that her role is \u201ctoo big a\nworkload to balance with studying for\na degree\u201d, and that people would lose\nthe opportunity to \u201ctalk to someone\nin a position of authority\u201d. According\nto the article, in the 17 weeks she has\nbeen in the role, she has had \u201cover 30\nstudents\u201d contact her for advice.\nAdditionally, in her article she\ncomplained that a gender equalities\nofficer would be problematic, as\n\u201cit would not have to be filled by a\nwoman.\u201d She contained, \u201ca man may\nwell be appointed \u2013 someone with no\nexperience of what it\u2019s like to live as a\nwoman or face misogyny\u201d.\nShe highlighted the Black and\nMinority Ethnics Students\u2019 Officer;\nanother proposed new position,\nas also potentially experiencing a\nsimilar issue.\nIn conclusion, she said, \u201cWhen\nwe\u2019re looking to make savings, why\nshould it be already marginalised\ngroups that have to suffer the most?\u201d\nHowever, in an article written\nto The Tab London, one of the\nproposers of the original motion,\nJames Simcox, said that an amended\nversion will be proposed at the next\nmeeting to rename the proposed\n\u201cGender Equalities Executive Officer\u201d\nto \u201cWomen\u2019s Executive Officer\u201d,\namongst other changes.\nFollowing the failure for the\nproposal to attain 75% of the vote,\nit will now be considered at UCLUs\nTrustee Board.\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\n\"Cut the\nnumber of\nsabbatical\nofficers as\na means\nto cutting\nUCLU's\ndeficit,\nwhich is\nrunning\ninto the\nregion of\nhundreds\nof\nthousands\nof pounds.\"\n\"Following\nthe failure\nfor the\nproposal\nto attain\n75% of the\nvote, it\nwill now be\nconsidered\nat UCLU's\nTrustee\nBoard.\"\nAfter the initial uproar\namongst academics caused\nby the publication of Stefan\nGrimm\u2019s damning posthumous\nemail, discussion has spread amongst\nacademics outside the Englishspeaking scientific community.\nThe biggest response by far has\nbeen seen amongst Chinese-speaking\nscientific academics. A number of\nmainland Chinese researchers, which\ninclude a mix of those stationed in UK\nuniversities and in Chinese academia,\nhave discussed the issue at length\non Chinese scientific news website\nSciencenet.cn.\nOn his personal blog, Zhang-qi Yin,\nan academic research fellow at the\nCenter for Quantum Information\nlocated in Tsinghua University\u2019s\nInstitute for Interdisciplinary\nInformation Sciences, mused that \u201cI\nbelieve that this common trend (of\nusing research grant income as a KPI)\nin the West will be picked up by China\nvery quickly; this gives me a strong\nsense of sympathy for my fellow\nacademics, and dread.\u201d\nSeveral citizens have also voiced\nconcern about the future of China\u2019s\nacademic culture, which believe\nthat research in the West is more\nprogressive and seeks to emulate their\nsuccesses.\nThe impact, however, goes beyond\nthat of the blogs hosted on and off the\nSciencenet website.\nSolidot, a tech portal set up by\nthe China branch of international\nconsumer tech media outlet CNET,\nalso briefly covered the dcscience.net\nblog post.\nChina is not the only country whose\nnews and social media portals have\ntouched the issue. Following a tip-off\nfrom medical student Jesper N. Kjaer\n(@jespernkjaer on Twitter), videnskab.\ndk in Denmark also published a story\nsummarizing the coverage from\ndcscience.net and the THE.\nThe virality of the story continues\nto grow, with dcscience.net receiving\nplenty of pingbacks from users sharing\nlinks to the blog post on Twitter\nand via their own blogs. A number\nof people have since adopted the\n#grimmdeath hashtag while voicing\ntheir thoughts on the issue, the\nmajority of which have condemned\nthe general culture of emphasizing\n\u201cheadline glory via grant input\u201d and\nnot the quality of output, plus the shift\nto a more business/administrative\nfocus in universities.\nWhile the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England\n(HEFCE) has wrapped up their formal\nconsultation for their independent\nreview on the role of metrics in\nassessing research quality, Colquhoun\nnoted that two members of the\nconsultation group are aware of the\nissue based on Twitter commentary,\nand that his open letter to President\nAlice Gast has gone unanswered.\nHe has since strongly pushed for\nan independent external inquiry to\nbe held, citing that \u201ctheir present\nproposal that the people who let things\ngo so far should investigate themselves\nhas been greeted with the scepticism\nthat it so richly deserves. I still live in\nhope that someone will be sufficiently\ncourteous to answer this time.\u201d\nIt seems the idea of \u201cPublish and\nPerish\u201d - the pressures to secure\nfunding or lose your job, are not\napparently unique to Imperial. It\nwas also recently reported in the\nIndependent that Academics at the\nUniversity of Warwick have accused\nthe university of treating them like\n\u201cCity Traders.\u201d Staff were put on a\nrisk of redundancy for not bringing\nin enough research income, with a\nbenchmark set for them to reach of\naround \u00a390,000.\nAnne O\u2019Sullivan, University and\nCollege Union regional official, added:\n\u201cWarwick Medical School is at the\nforefront of cutting edge research into\nlife-threatening illnesses, It should\nbe looking to foster closer links and\ndevelop its expertise, not arbitrarily\naxing staff.\n\u201cThe university\u2019s approach\ndemonstrates a worrying lack of\nunderstanding about research work\nand its funding. We would urge the\nuniversity to step back from this\nunusual move and reconsider how the\nschool might be able to meet targets.\u201d\nDeath of Professor Grimm: the world reacts\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nNEWS EDITOR\nFelix was recently approached by the Imperial College\nbranch of UCU,who we were told are investigating this\nincident:\nTheissueofmanagementbullyingandharassmentofstaffis\nnotnewtotheUCUortheotherstafftradeunions.Indeed,\nUCUbranchrepresentativeshaveraisedtheissuerepeatedly\ninregularmeetingswithCollegeManagementoverthecourse\nofthelastfewyears.

Whilst the\nimplications for the Paris Summit\nin 2015 seem positive, there are still\nquestion marks over how the US and\nChina will actually achieve these new\ntargets, or indeed, if they can be seen\nas achievements in the first place.\nFor the US, these new targets\nhave unfortunately coincided with\nthe Republican Party being elected\nto take control of both houses of\nCongress in 2015.\nGiven the Party\u2019s traditional\nresistance to climate change\nlegislation, President Obama may\nfind himself in a protracted struggle\nto make good on his promises \u2013 a\nluxury which the two remaining years\nof his Presidency do not afford him.\nUltimately too, whilst the\nagreement with China is classified\nin the US as a pollution measure\nand hence determined by Executive\nAction, Congress is still able to\nscrutinise all budgets and could easily\nstall any emissions cutbacks until\nPresident Obama\u2019s term has ended.\nTo some extent, the Obama\nAdministration has already taken\nsteps to reduce future emissions with\nthe US Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) this summer calling for\npower plants to cut CO2 emissions by\n30% by 2030 from a 2005 base.\nOn the other hand, given how high\nUS emissions (table above) have been\nin the last two decades, and long\nbefore (see World Resource Institute\nfor more information here), one of\nthe biggest questions that still hangs\nover the US and Western economies\nin general is whether historical\nemissions should be accounted for\nwhen setting reduction targets.\nFor developing countries, it has\nlong been a bone of contention that\nindustrialised nations who have\nhistorically been the biggest cause\nof climate change should attempt to\nestablish a deal that does not include\nthis at the expense of their own\neconomies\u2019 industrialisation through\n\u2018traditional\u2019 means.\nFor a long time, one of the key\narguments made alongside the\nhistorical emissions debate was that\nthe US and China, the world\u2019s two\nlargest polluters (table top right), had\nmade no progress so there was no\nreason for other nations to take the\ninitiative as any action would have\nbeen marginal by comparison.\nGiven that China, was, and still\nis, part of the push for historical\nemissions, its commitments are\narguably all the more important as\nTotal US greenhouse gas emissions 1990-2012. Image: EPA\nan marker to others that, despite\ndifferences, a deal in Paris still has\npotential.\nMoreover of course, China is the\nworld\u2019s largest consumer of coal\nand, according to the Global Carbon\nProject, was responsible for 28% of\nglobal GHG emissions in 2013 (with\nthe US at 14%), a rise from 2012-2013\nof 4.2% in the country\u2019s emissions.\nAs such, whilst the ambiguity of\n\u201cby at least 2030\u201d is frustrating, the\nburden for action seems to weigh\nmuch more heavily on China. Given\nits prodigious fossil fuel growth, even\nwith 24% of the world\u2019s renewable\nenergy capacity according to this\nyear\u2019s Global Status Report, the\nimportance of this target cannot be\noverstated.\nMain image: Wikimedia commons\nContributions to global temperature increase by top 20 greenhouse gas\nemitters Image: Concordia University\n\n"

There.\nI\u2019ve said it. As Arts Editor, you\nwould think it antithetical\nthat I could find dance deathly dull,\nbut in all honesty I can\u2019t tell my pli\u00e9\nfrom my pointe, and have held a deep\ndislike of the art ever since being\nforced by my parents to attend ballet\nlessons in my childhood (I protested;\nthey switched me to piano; everyone\nwas happy). So when attending the\nGallery of Russian Art and Design,\nwhose newest exhibition is centred\naround a Shostakovich ballet entitled\nThe Bolt, I encountered one of those\nall-too-frequent moments that made\nme think: \u201cwell, perhaps I should\nhave been born in early 20th\ncentury\nRussia\u201d\nIf I had been born in, say, 1911,\nthen (presuming I survived WWI,\nthe Russian Revolution, and the\nensuing Civil War) instead of being\nsick to death of Swan Lake, I could be\nsitting in the front row of The Bolt,\na work that seems miles away from\nanything I have ever seen. For a\nstart, The Bolt is fun. Choreographed\nby Fyodor Lopukhov, who worked\nat the Bolshoi Ballet, dancers\nin The Bolt took on machinistic\ncharacteristics, using their arms and\nlegs to recreate the thunking and\nclunking of heavy machinery in an\nacrobatic celebration of the marvels\nof modern technology. Lopukhov\nwas a dynamic choreographer, who\nwas focussed on uniting the worlds of\nclassical ballet and technical dance; a\nresolute modernist, his work has been\nreappraised as quietly influential\non a whole host of 20th\ncentury\nchoreographers.\nThe plot of The Bolt \u2013 which would\nprove to be its eventual downfall \u2013 is\nrelatively simple: Lenka Gulba, which\ntranslates literally as Lazy Idler,\nis a rube, whose only wish is to get\nplastered with his gang of misfits;\ndetermined to continue drinking,\nthey plan to disrupt the factory\u2019s new\nmachine, convincing patsy Goshka to\ndrop a large bolt in the engine; luckily\nshortly after enacting their plan\nthe gang is caught, with help from\nKomsomol, the young communists\u2019\nleague. Interspersed with variety\nperformances from the local factory\nworkers, the plot allowed for a cast of\narchetypical characters such as \u2018The\nPetit-Bourgeois\u2019, \u2018The Job-Hopper\u2019,\nand \u2018The Counter-Revolutionary\u2019.\nThese characters were skilfully\nbrought to life by Tatiana Bruni,\nwhose bright, bold costume designs\nform the majority of the exhibition.\nA child of an artistic family, Bruni\ngrew up straddling two worlds:\nalthough born in a pre-revolution\nRussia, she graduated from art school\nin the blinding light of the new\nSoviet Union, with a government\nthat promised equality, justice, and a\ndictatorship of the proletariat. This\noptimism is reflected in her designs,\nwhich are like constructivist marvels\ntransformed into children\u2019s book\ncharacters; the gouache drawings\nstill look as fresh as the day they\nwere made, and we have a number\nof meticulously preserved costumes\nused in the original show for\nreference.\nUnfortunately, the ballet fell foul of\nthe censors; following its premiere in\n1931, critics panned the production,\nand it was not to be performed\nagain for another 74 years. At the\ntime Shostakovich was the golden\nchild of Soviet music, but this would\nnot be the first time his work was\nsuppressed: his next ballet, which also\nhappened to be his last, was closed\nafter a negative review in Soviet\nmouthpiece Pravda \u2013 entitled The\nBright Stream, it followed The Bolt in\nhis triptych of contemporary Soviet\nlife, and revolved around life on a\ncollectivist farm.\nUltimately, the reason for the\ndownfall of the ballet was its satirical\nelements, which had no place in\nthe USSR of the 1930s, which was\nincreasingly moving towards Socialist\nRealism as a preferred method\nof artistic output. Although the\nballet included all the usual pro-communist, anti-religion messages,\nthe characters were deemed to be\nfarcical, and therefore damaging\nto the Soviet status-quo. Not only\nthat, but Shostakovich included\nsnippets of jazz and foxtrot into\nhis score, infuriating critic who saw\nsuch styles as \u2018Western imperialism\u2019,\nand Lopukhov was accused of a\n\u2018dancification\u2019 of industrial progress\n\u2013 a serious error in the eyes of\ngovernmental censors.\nAnd thus The Bolt was consigned\nto history. While there have been\na couple of revivals since the fall of\nthe USSR, very little interest has\nbeen generated since; hopefully, with\nthe opening of GRAD\u2019s exhibition,\nwe will see a renewed interest in\nthis ballet. The rare opportunity\nto see Bruni\u2019s designs in the flesh\nis marvellous, since they can be\ndescribed as nothing less than\nbreathtaking. With their lyrical use\nof colour, geometric precision, and\nwonderful witticism, they should\nrank in the highest echelons of\nConstructivist art; Bruni deserves\nto have a place in Russian art\nhistory alongside luminaries such\nas Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara\nStepanova, and Lyubov Popova.\nThe costume designs, alongside\nGRAD\u2019s informative supplementary\ninformation \u2013 usefully provided on\niPads \u2013 allow us a glimpse at how\nartistic institutions operated within\nthe governmental superstructure\nthat was the USSR. We learn that\nthe industrial sabotage that drives\nthe libretto is no mere plot device,\nbut an actual fear for many Soviets,\nin no small part thanks to the 1930\nIndustrial Party Trial, during which\na group of ministers were accused\nof plotting a coup. Bruni\u2019s leaning\ntowards simple, childish designs is\nperhaps explained by a quote from\nAntonii Lunacharsky, Commissar\nfor Education, who saw the arts as a\nperfect means for education a largely\nilliterate population: \u201cAgitation and\npropaganda acquire particular acuity\nand effectiveness when they are\nclothed in the attractive and mighty\nform of art\u201d.\nThus \u2018The Job-Hopper\u2019 has a pair\nof wings emerging from his derri\u00e8re,\n\u2018The American Navy\u2019 character is\nsmoking a nuclear-missile cigar,\nand \u2018The Bureaucrat\u2019 has been\ntransformed into a literal bureau,\na pair of stacked-paper legs bulging\nTatiana Bruni, Kozelkov's Girlfriend, Costume Design for The Bolt, 1931, gouache and\nwatercolour on paper.

Her design\nfor \u2018The Terrorist\u2019 is particularly\nenlightening; the worst fears of the\nSoviet Union are given human form\nas a thin woman wearing a voguish\nhat and a sumptuous ballgown. Run\nfor your lives, the bourgeois are here!\nGRAD have managed to not just\npresent a fine collection of art, but\n\u2013 through archive photographs,\ncostume reproductions, and\nShostakovich piped through the\ngallery\u2019s speaker system \u2013 have\nmanaged a near-impossible feat of\nbringing a ballet to life. If it only gave\nexposure to Bruni\u2019s work, that would\nhave been enough, but GRAD goes\nabove and beyond, giving us an idea\nof what life was like in the USSR, not\nonly for those in the artistic world,\nbut the general population too. So\nnext time you\u2019re pining for a return\nto the values of the USSR of the 1930s,\ninstead of calling everyone Comrade\nand contracting TB, just pop down to\nGreat Titchfield Street instead, and\nexperience this modern marvel of\nballet.\n\"The worst\nfears of\nthe Soviet\nUnion\nare given\nhuman\nform\"\n\"Perhaps\nI should\nhave been\nborn in\nearly 20th\ncentury\nRussia\"\n\n"

As we left we could see some students climb\nsilently into crevices of the walls and above the shelves so they could stay later without the\nsecurity guards noticing.\nWe didn\u2019t pay either, we pretended we were going down to the Newspaper Office and\nthen got past the security. We saved like \u00a32.50! LOL\nI went to the Union with my only two course friends who were helping me with my essay.\nI got quite drunk and started to whatsapp Dorothy, but decided she\u2019s a skank for sleeping\nwith Kris. I don\u2019t know how it ended up happening, but for some reason it was then 3am\nand I was just sitting on the floor of the gender neutral toilets sobbing into a radiator. I\ndidn\u2019t even get to finish my snakebite.\nSaturday 6th\nSo hungover today, I spent all day in bed and couldn\u2019t bring myself to turn my phone on in\ncase Dorothy had messaged back.\nSunday 7th\nStill haven\u2019t turned on my phone. I am back in the library so am using that as an excuse\nto not respond to her. Finished my essay though thank god! I made sure to put it all on\nfacebook so people at home could see how hard it is going to Imperial sometimes. I\u2019ve not\nseen anyone at home tag themselves in the library.\nMonday 8th\nFinally turned on my phone, and I only had one message from Dorothy saying we need to\ntalk about what happened with Kris Craye. We met in the library caf\u00e9 and I got there\nDiary Of A Fresher aged 18 3/4\nearly and bought her favourite, jacket potato with cheese and tuna.\nI was waiting in the corner, and then Dorothy rolled into the cafe \u2013 she was in a wheelchair. She\ntold me how the doctors said the feeling would return to her legs in three to four weeks and then\nshe would walk again, and eventually she would regain the sight in her left eye once the protein-cleansing eye drops started to take effect.\nShe was also wearing a neck brace, and later told me she also has a makeshift tattoo saying \u201cThis\nass was owned by the D\u2026PW.\u201d She said the tattoo happened after they left the union, and although\ncouldn\u2019t remember parts of it, they ended up in some 24 hour tattoo parlour in Soho. They went\nlater to a casino somewhere apparently, then finally went back to his room in halls.\nShe said she was sorry, left her potato untouched, then slowly wheeled away. She accidently tried to\nwheel through the wrong glass door of the library entrance, but I was so sad I didn\u2019t even laugh.\nTuesday 9th\nStill sad about Dorothy. WHAT IF SHE WAS THE ONE?\nWednesday 10th\nSaw Kris around campus being followed by about five other girls, apparently the fact that he was so\ngood in bed he\u2019s left a girl unable to walk for four weeks has made him into a legend.\nI went to the toilet in physics today and someone had drawn a giant penis on the door, and then\nsomeone had labelled it \u201cHere for your Welfare.\u201d\nThursday 11th\nSaw Dorothy today, using the mechanical lift by the stairs on Dalby Court. She shook her head sadly\nat me when I called her name, and slowly waved as she was rolled away by her friend into the\nbuilding.\nSo sad about Dorothy I cried under the Queen\u2019s Tower during lunchtime. It was so dramatic.\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 29\n12.12.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor: Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTatiana Bruni, The Terrorist, Costume Design for The Bolt, 1931, gouache\nand watercolour on paper. Photo: GRAD and St Petersburg Museum of\nTheatre and Music\nInterview: Fred Fyles speaks to Bolt curator Alex Chirac\nQ: How did you first hear about\nThe Bolt, and what made you want\nto run an exhibition on it?\nA: We were approached by the\nSt. Petersburg State Museum of\nTheatre and Music with the idea of\ncollaborating on an exhibition. We\nwere of course delighted to work\nwith them on such a project, and\nBolt seemed an ideal subject, both\nbecause we thought GRAD would\nprovide a great space to display\nthe works, and also because we\nwould be introducing an unusual\nand relatively unknown topic to a\nLondon audience\nQ: Were there any particular\nchallenges trying to bring\na ballet \u2013 a production so\nkinetic and dynamic \u2013 into\nthe exhibition space? Was it\ndifficult to try and convey the\nexpressiveness of the ballet\u2019s\nmovements?\nA: Incorporating movement\ninto an exhibition space inevitably\nhas its own challenges. However,\nthe photographs and drawings\nthemselves are dynamic and\nvibrant, and give a great impression\nof the energy that the performance\nas a whole would have had.\nQ: One of the major focusses\nof the exhibition is the work by\ndesigner Tatiana Bruni, whose\ncostume designs are delightfully\nbold. It seems \u2013 to me at least\n\u2013 that her work deserves to sit\nalongside Rodchenko and Popova\nin Russian art history, and yet\nshe seems to have been largely\nforgotten. Why do you think this\nis?\nA: They are indeed charming and\nwitty, but 1931 proved to be too late\nfor constructivist-inspired design as\nSocialist Realism was gaining ground.\nBruni was almost a generation\nyounger than Popova or Rodchenko,\nand was not really part of the same\navant garde movement, although she\nwas influenced by their aesthetics,\nsuch as the ROSTA window\npropaganda designs. Perhaps partially\nbecause of the ongoing interest in\nthat earlier period from researchers\nand the public, artists such as Bruni\nhave faded into the background: she\nwas really part of the last gasp of the\nRussian avant garde.\nQ: The ballet premiered at a time\nwhen Socialist Realism was starting\nto become the main artistic style\nused by the Soviet Union to\ncommunicate their ideas. How\nmuch room do you think there is\nin art for politics?\nA: Art is almost always political\nin some way, and in Russia and the\nSoviet Union art had been used as\na political tool for decades before\nSocialist Realism. You only have to\nthink of Mayakovsky, Rodchenko\nand others from the earlier avant\ngarde, where radical aesthetics so\noften went hand-in-hand with radical\npolitics. Part of the reason that works\nof that period still interest us today is\nprecisely because they were political\nin some way; Bolt, for instance, has a\nreal satirical bite, based on the real-life industrial sabotage trials of the\nearly 1930s.\nQ: The story of The Bolt\nis an interesting one: it was\ncommissioned by the state-supported Moscow Art Theatre, but\nthen banned by the government.\nTo what extent to you think the\nstate supports/hinders the arts, and\nwhat role should the government\nplay within the arts?\nA: The Soviet context suggests\nits own particular problems when\nconsidering that question, since\nmost art (and certainly major theatre\nproductions) was commissioned by\nstate institutions during that period:\nthere was rarely any room for private\nenterprise. In addition, Bolt was not\ndirectly banned by the government,\nrather it was very harshly criticized\nin the press, which in a climate of\nparanoia made the theatre withdraw\nthe ballet. The influence of ideology\nwas all-pervasive and worked even\nwithout direct intervention.\nA Winter Guide to London Culture\nKamil McClelland gives a guide to the best of what\u2019s on this Christmas\nTerm is nearly over, the Christmas jumpers are out and the mulled wine is\nflowing freely.

Normally,\nonly one angel wears a fantasy bra each year, but for this\nyear\u2019s show, two were made for the angels who have been\nmodelling for Victoria\u2019s Secret for the longest. The fantasy\nbras are typically designed with precious stones and\nmetals encrusted in them, and are usually very elabroate\nand expensive. Worth over $2 million each, the bra\u2019s were\nmade by Mouawad jewelers using 16,000 rubies, diamonds\nand sapphires. All the jewels were strung together with\n18 karat yellow gold chains. Both bras took over 1,380\nhours to make and were inspired by \u201cthe magic of faraway\nlands.\u201d Alessandra began her modelling career at the\ntender age 15, and she has been modelling for Victoria\u2019s\nSecret since 2004, making her a household name at the\nbrand. For the 2008 Victoria\u2019s Secret show, she walked the\nrunway only 3 months after giving birth to her first child!\nWhen she started with Victoria\u2019s Secret at 21, she never\nworked out and would just eat salad if she gained a pound\nor two.The model has two children, a fianc\u00e9 and a fashion\nline.\nAngel: Karlie Kloss\nThe Gilded Angels collection\nHere, Karlie wears the Dream Angels lace and tulle\npush-up bra ($79.50-89.50.) The American angel is fast\nbecoming an Instagram sensation. Her best friend, Taylor\nSwift, sang at the show and the two were going selfie crazy\nback stage! Standing tall at an incredible 6\u20191, she is the\ntallest of all the angels. She is absolutely OBSESSED with\nbaking cookies, and she even collaborated with Momofuku\nMilk bar to create a recipe called \u2018Karlie\u2019s Kookies,\u2019 which\nshe sold at the DKNY store in New York city for Vogue\nFashion\u2019s Night Out. She donated all the proceeds to\nbenefit hungry children across the world through a project\ncalled FEED.\nAngel: Candice Swanepoel\nThe Fairy Tale collection\nFor Candice\u2019s fairy tale inspired look, she\u2019s wearing a\nleather trimmed unlined bra and underwear, priced at\n$258 and $98, respectively. At that price, we\u2019ll probably\nbe saving that set for Valentine\u2019s day! The stunning model\nwas scouted when she was just 15 at a flea market in South\nAfrica. When it comes to keeping her body toned, boxing\nis her exercise of choice for a fun, full-body workout. For\nthe guy\u2019s out there who are interested in her, bad luck \u2013\nshe\u2019s been dating sexy Brazilian model Hermann Nicoli\nfor over 6 years.

It is in\nthis climate that Croatian playwright\nTena \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107 sets her play 3 Winters,\nwhich premiered at the National\nTheatre last week; a carefully\ncrafted drama, 3 Winters takes on\nseven decades of Croatian history,\nfrom their emergence from WWII\nto their acceptance into the EU. By\nfocussing on four generations of the\nKos family living in Zagreb, and how\nthey cope being buffeted by the winds\nof history, 3 Winters shows that not\nonly is the personal political, but the\npolitical is personal\nThe action takes place in a single\nivy-clad house, which shifts through\ngenerations thanks to Tim Hatley\u2019s\nimpeccably precise stage design.\nIn 1945, partisan Rose lucks out in\nhousing allocation, thanks to her\nassociations with generals, moving\ninto the house in which she was born\nin a bourgeois area of Zagreb, with\nher mother, baby daughter Masha,\nand husband, who is fresh from the\nfront after being conscripted onto the\nlosing side; in 1991 the family gather\nin the house, Masha\u2019s sister Dunya\nreturning from Germany to join\nthem for Rose\u2019s funeral; and in 2011\nMasha\u2019s youngest daughter Lucia is\nset to marry a venture capitalist with\nquestionable morals, Croatia is on the\ncusp of becoming a full EU member,\nand everything in Masha\u2019s life seems\nto be unravelling.\nDirector Howard Davies makes the\nbold choice not to mark which period\nwe are in; the chopping and changing\nof the furniture gives us a clue as to\nhow far we are through time, but\n\u0160tivi\u010di\u0107\u2019s script switches between\ntime zones every ten minutes. The\nresult is a play that, although difficult\nto follow initially, works out in the\nlong-run; this is not quick theatre,\nbut over the course of 150 minutes, as\nwe move backwards and forwards in\ntime, the play unfolds like a beautiful\nmid-winter flower.\nThe themes that \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107 takes\non manage to be both vast and\nintimate; throughout the play there\nis an ideological battle between\nthe collectivist values that Masha\nholds so dear, and those of Lucia,\nwhose celebration of neoliberalism\nrepresents a Croatia that is keen\nto let the past be the past. \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107\nuses her cast of characters to\nrepresent different values; capitalist,\ncommunist, fascist, elitist, these\nall get a look in. With some other\nwriters, this battle may seem heavy-handed, but \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107\u2019s use of the house\nas a microcosm of Croatian society is\nhandled with a deft touch.\nAt times, this conflict shifts\ninto melodrama, exemplified in\nthe characters of Lucia, the proto-capitalist of a new Europe, and her\nolder sister Alisa, returning from\nBritain on a break from her PhD\nand horrified by her sister\u2019s decision\nto evict all the tenants of their\npalatial home. The two characters are\nplayed against each other from the\nbeginning, and \u2013 aside from some\nmoments where the frost thaws,\nparticularly in the last scene, fierce\nin its fiery intensity \u2013 in general lack\nnuance. Perhaps \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107 felt that\nthe script needed a further injection\nof drama, but when one looks at\nCroatian history is seems that conflict\nis one thing not in short supply.\nOverall, one of the things that\n3 Winters does best is explore the\nimpact of national crises on the\nindividual family unit, especially the\nability that women have to adapt to\na history driven largely by the action\nof men. In the Kos household there\nare four generation of women, who\nhave survived frostbite, starvation,\nwar, insanity, domestic abuse, and\nthe death of all they hold dear,\nboth individuals and ideas. At the\ncentre of this matriarchal clan are\nsisters Masha and Dunya, played\nwith exceptional verve by Siobhan\nFinneran and Lucy Black; Finneran\nespecially imbues the stage with a\nfirecracker tenacity bursting through\na calm, collected facade. Masha is a\nwoman in dire pains, whose life has\nmoved from upset to upset; now, on\nthe eve of her daughter\u2019s wedding,\nshe tries to hold things all together,\n\"The play\nfocuses\non four\ngenerations\nof the Kos\nfamily, and\nhow they\nare buffeted\nby history\"\nfor just one day more. As she sees\neverything that she held dear moving\naway from her, a crisis of conscience\nis provoked: \u201cthey think our values\nare quaint\u201d she cries, lamenting what\nshe sees as the death of society.\nWith four generations of mothers\nand daughters under one roof, \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107\nhas crafted a retinue of strong female\ncharacters: Rose, a former partisan\nfighter who battled against the fascist\ndictatorship from the woods; Monika,\nwho was dismissed from her job as a\nmaid following being impregnated by\nthe lord of the house; and Karolina,\nthe flame-haired former owner of the\nhouse, whose Nazi father put her in\na mental hospital, and associations\nwith aristocracy place her under\nthreat in a new Croatian state. It has\nbeen far too long since such a cast\nof strong women have graced the\nstage, played with equal verve by the\ncompetent cast.\nWith its radical approach to\ntime, and unwillingness to follow a\nconventional chronology, \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107\u2019s\n3 Winters may initially seem like\nan exercise in cold intellectualism;\nhowever, this is a play, Chekhovian\nin ambition, that deserves your full\nattention before it reveals its true\nvalue. Winter in Zagreb may be brisk,\nbut \u0160tivi\u010di\u0107 and Davies allow us to sit\nat the hearth of a family home, and\nbask in its warm heart.\n3 Winters is on at The National\nTheatre, until 3rd\nFebruary 2015. Tickets\nstart from \u00a315.\nThe company of 3 Winters, now on at the National Theatre Photo: Ellie Kurttz\n\"This play,\nChekhovian\nin ambition,\ndeserves\nyour full\nattention\nbefore it\nreveals its\ntrue value\"\n\n"

Sanjeev Gupta,\na Professor of Earth Science from\nthe Royal School of Mines, teaches\nmultiple undergraduate courses\nalongside his work with NASA on the\nRover, and was part of the team that\nmade the discovery.\nGupta analyses the rocks that\nthe Rover is sampling in a bid to\nunderstand the geology of the\nplanet and decipher the ancient\nenvironments Mars may have had.\nThe rocks feature particular\nsedimentary patterns which suggest\nthat lakes have periodically formed\nthen evaporated in the large crater\nthe Rover has been traversing over.\nCuriosity has been steadily travelling\nacross the crater towards the\nmountain in the middle, and is now\nlooking at the rock patterns at the\nbase of the 5km high formation.\nThe lakes may have been formed\nfrom snow running off the edges of\nthe crater and melting in the process.\nRivers carried sand and silt into\nthe lake too, which then settled at\nthe bottom. As this cycle repeated,\nthe sediment formed the base of\nthe mountain over tens of millions\nof years and contributed to the\npatterning of the rocks, known as the\nMurray formation.\nFelix spoke to Gupta about his\ninvolvement in the mission, how he\nbalances working on Curiosity with\nhis teaching and the future plans for\nthe Rover. Gupta has been involved\nwith Curiosity since the launch, and\nis a strategic planner for Curiosity.\nGupta liaises with the scientists and\nengineers working on the mission,\nand outlines the schedules and long-term aims of the project to make\nsure that everything stays on track.\nHe also works on analysing the data\ncollected by the Rover, which he does\nfrom the comfort of his own home,\nand here at Imperial.\nGupta told Felix about his\ninvolvement with the mission: \u201cIt\nis fantastic and I have a really good\ninsight into the mission having the\ndual role that I have.\n\u201cSince the team is spread across the\nworld, we spend a lot of time running\naround making phone calls, sending\nemails and having discussions online.\nI have to make a lot of economical\ndecisions too, as the mission is very\nexpensive. Every day we are under\npressure to keep moving, and collect\ndata too.\u201d\nHe also told Felix that although\nit is difficult at times to balance his\nPhoto: NASA\nrole with the Rover and his teaching\nduties, the students are very excited\nabout the project. \u201cMy fourth year\nclass will actually be looking at the\nCuriosity data and doing the same\nsort of analysis we are doing as part of\nthe project.\n\u201cIt is exciting to be able to transfer\nthat knowledge onto a younger\ngeneration.\u201d\nAlthough Gupta explains that the\nmission is not to find traces of life on\nthe planet right now, they are keeping\nan eye out for organic compounds\nthat may suggest that there was life\non Mars in the past.\nAnalysis of rocks that make up the\nsurface of the planet indicate that\nthe bodies of water were larger and\nremained for longer than previously\nthought, and suggest that the climate\nof the planet that allowed for this\nmay even have sustained microbial\nlife.\nWhen water was present in the\ncrater, the conditions may have been\nfavourable for microbe survival, but\nthe life forms may have also resided\nbelow the surface once the lake dried\nout.\nModels of the climate are yet to\nprove that conditions would have\nallowed for the lakes to remain for a\nprolonged length of time, but does\nsuggest there may have been other\nlarge bodies of water on the planet in\nThe Curiosity of one Imperial scientist\n\"It is\nfantastic\nand I have\na really\ngood\ninsight\ninto the\nmission\nhaving the\ndual role I\nhave\"\nthe past.\nSo what are the plans for the Rover\nnow?

They didn\u2019t even\nmanage to remove their ties.\n\u201cIt was a miracle no-one was\nhurt.\u201d Another group of students\nwere left stranded on the side of\nHammersmith Road, after damage\nto the window of a number 9 bus\nresulted in all passengers having to\ndisembark from the vehicle.\nSources close to Hangman said that\nthe boys were sitting at the bottom\nof the bus, and were quietly talking\nwhen one of the party members got\nup to help an elderly woman to her\nseat.\nAs the bus lurched forward,\nwitnesses stated a metal drinking\nflask was flung from his sports kit\nin his backpack and smashed the\nwindow on the opposite site of the\nvehicle.\nSaid one witness, \u201cIt was absolute\nanarchy. The bus wasn\u2019t going at\nfull speed, thank the lord, otherwise\npeople might have been sucked out of\nthe empty window.\n\u201cIf the bus hadn\u2019t come to a stop,\nwe might have all been severely\ninjured, or worse.\u201d\nSeveral other students also tried\nto get a ferry to Westminster, after\na late night training session based\nin Greenwich. Whilst on the boat,\nwitnesses said that one of the boys\nwas complaining of feeling ill.\n\u201cHe looked really pale, and kept\nlolling forward then seemingly\nHangman Features Apparently\nLegitimate News Articles This\nEntire Time\nSources close to Hangman today\nrevealed that the features on this\npage have in fact been genuine,\nbona fide news for some time now,\nand rest assured that no-one is more\nsurprised than we are.\nThe allegations surfaced during\na Union Council meeting, during\nwhich an individual (who cannot\nbe named) used one of last week\u2019s\n\u2018articles\u2019 as a supporting source in\ntheir argument.\n\u201cAt first, I thought they were\njust Onion-style satirical features\ndesigned to subtly mock aspects\nof life at Imperial and, to a lesser\nextent, Chris Kaye\u201d, says Vanilla\nBlancmange, a third-year EEE\nstudent. \u201cBut then [redacted]\nconfidently referred to something\nwritten in Hangman as fact and, well,\nthat was that.\u201d\nHangman managed to secure\na statement from a Hangman in\nresponse to the shock revelations:\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know who I am\nany more. I thought my job was to\nbash out a few hundred words of\nmoderately witty dross every week,\nnever did I imagine that it would\nall end up coming true. I\u2019d advise\nanyone born between March and\nFebruary to watch themselves over\nthe coming weeks. Now if you\u2019ll\nexcuse me, I\u2019m going to go drink\nmyself to death in the Felix office\nin flagrant violation of the Clubs,\nSocieties & Projects Policy.\u201d\nPhilippa Skett, the Felix editor,\nwas similarly surprised and even\nquestioned the allegations. \u201cWe\nprint news now?\u201d, she asked, before\nreturning to her workstation\nto manually change the colour\nof dozens of digital snowflakes\nindividually in Photoshop.\nIn unrelated news, Hangman has\nbeen nominated for a Guardian\nStudent Media Award for its\nextensive coverage of new halls on\nthe Isle of Wight which students still\nreckon will be better than Acton.\nwaking up. He must have been\nabsolutely wasted, it was disgusting.\u201d\nMedical teams were called to meet\nthe boat when the student could not\nbe roused, and his teammates looked\nanxiously on as he was put into an\nambulance near Westminster dock.\nIt was later revealed that the\nstudent was diabetic, and had\nskipped dinner before their match.\nHis worried teammates accompanied\nhim to the hospital, and spent the\nnight by his bedside.\nAll in all, a total of thirty students\nwere unable to reach the Union\nDining Hall for 6.30pm to discuss\nthe motion of no confidence. Several\ndid make it as far as Beit Quad, but\nwere then distracted after walking\nthrough the bar.\nSaid Wom Theeler, Union\nPresident, on the lack of attendance:\n\u201cI thought more of them cared about\ntheir captain than this, but it seems\nonce again boys will be boys and have\ncaused absolute chaos.\n\u201cWe cannot confirm or deny at\nthis stage that we will be producing\na motion of no confidence against\nthe motion of the sporting teams\nin general; it seems they purely\ncannot be trusted to use any sort of\ntransportation system any more.\u201d\nWhen Hangman approached\nBarclay\u2019s Bike Hire to ask if they had\nreceived any reports of disorderly\nbehaviour , a spokesperson replied:\n\u201cNot yet, but we reckon it will only\nbe a matter of time.\u201d\nAn artist's impression of Hangman's \"news\".

Granted, subtraction can always be\ndifficult Credit: GettyImages\nIt\u2019s that time of the term again.\nWell, for those of us unfortunate\nenough to have end-of-term\nexams anyway (e.g. me). As the\ndays are getting shorter, colder and\nrevision hours are ticking away like\na time bomb, it\u2019s hard to stay festive\neven with Christmas so close.\nAnd for those with beginning of\nterm exams, a Christmas dinner with\nrevision at the back of your mind is\nprobably not what you had in mind\nfor the holiday spirit.\nBut don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re all in the\nsame boat, and here are some tips that\nwill help you survive the exam stress\nthis time of the year.\nThere\u2019s no perfect revision\nschedule\nBy the time you\u2019ve come to\nuniversity, you would have realized\nthat people work best at different\ntimes. But during exam periods, the\nconstant comparison between you\nand the rest of the class can make you\nforget that.\nTalking to an early bird about her\nrevision routine doesn\u2019t mean that\nyou\u2019re starting too late. And that\nnight owl boasting about his all-nighter? It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not\nworking hard enough either.\nEveryone has their own\npreferences. This includes how often\nyou take breaks, where you work best,\nwhether you should suspend your\nFacebook account and even should\nyou should go to a party this evening?\nThe most important thing is to keep\ntrack of how well you\u2019re covering the\ntopics. Don\u2019t forget that!\nIt\u2019s OK to take breaks\nIt is closely related to the point above\nbut very important to emphasise,\nespecially for those preparing to have\na revision-plagued holiday. Taking\nbreaks or having a trip abroad is\nallowed. Diligence may be a virtue\nbut so is temperance. So don\u2019t be a\nScrooge and do have some fun.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s so much to revise\nand there\u2019s never enough time to\nmemorise everything!\u201d A particularly\nhardworking student might say.\nWell, look at it this way. You can\u2019t\noverwork yourself and get burnt out,\nspending days looking blankly over\nyour notes. So if you factor in those\nbreaks into your revision schedule,\nyou are much more likely to make\nsure that you get the most out of the\ndays you do work. Efficiency is key,\nnot raw hours dedicated to sitting\ndown with your books.\nFor those with exams practically\nglaring down their faces, breaks can\nmean just an evening to cool off so\nthat your brain can have some time\nto consolidate what it has learned.\nA break when you need it will make\nsure what you learned stays in your\nhead and keep you going for the next\nround.\nPeople lie\nIn addition to a cynical truth, it\u2019s also\nwhat people do leading up to exams.\nYour course mates, people in the year\nabove, your sister, your grandpa. If\nthey said that they have stormed\nthrough 8 hours a day without as\nmuch as a toilet break, they\u2019re most\nlikely lying to you. It\u2019s a good old\nintimidation technique or an attempt\nto become \u2018holier-than-thou\u2019.\nEven if they genuinely believed\nthat they had been such a staunch\nreviser, they probably forget to count\nall those moments they were trying\nto find the perfect revision playlist,\nclearing their head with Candy Crush\nor writing an article for the university\nnewspaper.\nThis tip also applies to those guys\nwho lean back on their chairs and\nsaid, \u201cOh, that exam? I just revised it\nthe day before. You\u2019d be dumb to fail\nit.\u201d\nBest bet? Trust yourself to assess\nhow you\u2019re doing and only take away\nwhat is useful, like the relevance\nof that last lecture. Only you know\nwhether you should spend more or\nless time revising.\nTake a step back\nTunnel vision is the nemesis of exam\nrevision. That\u2019s when you judge your\nentire academic performance based\non the one single thing you happened\nto focus your attention on in your\npanic.\nNo, you\u2019re not going to fail because\nyou missed all the revision sessions.\nNo, you\u2019re not a failure if you slept in\ntoday. And no, you won\u2019t be kicked\nout of Imperial if you can\u2019t get\nyourself to revise today after a long\nsolid week.\nThese things aren\u2019t going to make\nor break your exams. As long as what\nyou\u2019re doing is getting you closer to\nunderstanding your subject, it\u2019s better\nnot to dwell on the details.\nTry to look at the wider picture of\nhow you\u2019re doing overall. What if\ninstead of attending those revision\nsessions, you managed to master a\nparticularly difficult topic? Don\u2019t let\nthat one thing pull everything else\ndown.\nTake an even larger step back\nNear-spiritual anecdote coming\nup. When I was an undergraduate\npreparing for my finals, I remember\nbeing so stressed that new veins\nstarted sprouting across my temples.\nI was so stressed I don\u2019t think I could\nhold a normal conversation anymore.\nThe evening before my first exam,\nI gave up revising. As I hopelessly\nprocrastinated, I stumbled across\na video about Chris Hadfield, the\nCanadian astronaut who did a cover\nof \u2018Space Oddity\u2019 in space, talking\nabout earth from the window of the\nInternational Space Station.\nHe said that every single person\nin the history of mankind had lived\nand died on that blue globe floating\nbefore him. Once you\u2019ve had that\nperspective, the scale of whatever\nyou face diminishes in comparison.\nInsignificance is usually scary, but it\u2019s\nexactly what I needed to be reminded\nof at that moment.\nThat reminded me what these\nexams really were. Just something\nthat most people went through\nin their lives being as scared and\nnervous as I was, and for a great\nmajority of those people, it went\nbetter than expected.\nSo if the worst comes to the worst\nand you feel truly doomed for the\nexam, just remember that exams\ndon\u2019t determine lives.\nYou might feel that it does right\nnow, but your worst case scenario is\nnot going to happen.\nExams usually end with a huge\nsigh of relief and even if it doesn\u2019t,\nremember that it\u2019s just a termly exam\nand you\u2019ll have plenty of chance to\nredeem yourself.\nBest of luck!\n\n"

Photo: gamespot\nJames Dutton reviews the latest Game of Thrones game\nSimulating your Xmas Shopping...\nMAXIMILIAN EGGL\nGAMES EDITOR\n\"Every\nsingle piece\nof dialogue\nyou select\nto say feels\nlike it\ncounts.\"\n\"Christmas\nShopping\nSimulator\nwas ripped\noff from\ngoat\nsimulator. \"\n\"The\nobvious\nadvertising\nfor GAME\nwas really\njarring.\"\nTelltale Games have put their\nname to another TV franchise\nand this time round it is the\ngiant that is Game of Thrones. For\nthose not familiar with the Telltale\nstyle, the game is a combination of\npoint-and-click and quick-time events.\nThose wishing to run about Westeros\nas Benjen Stark/Daario Naharis\nwielding an axe, killing whoever they\nplease should look away now. But\nwhat the game lacks in exciting play\nstyles, it makes up completely with an\nabsorbing and completely interactive\nstory.\nThe first episode sees you play as\nthree different characters, all related\nto the House of Forrester. You start\nas Gared Tuttle \u2013 humble son of a pig\nfarmer and squire to the noble Lord\nGregor Forrester. Your first mission\nis to gather wine to further celebrate\nthe marriage of Robb Stark (the self-proclaimed King in the North) and\nJeyneWesterling.BookreadersandTV\nwatchers know what happens next and\nyou\u2019re stuck in the middle of it. You get\noutofthesituationaliveandhavebeen\ngiven the responsibility of taking Lord\nForrester\u2019s sword back to your home\ntown of Ironrath.\nYou also get to play as two of Lord\nForrester\u2019s children: Ethan and Mira\nForrester. Ethan is not much more\nthan a boy back at Ironwrath and Mira\nisactingashandmaidenfortheQueen-to-be Margaery Tyrell. This means\nthere are three main environments\nfor you to explore: the road back to\nIronwrath as Gared, the town itself as\nEthan and a small section of the great\nKing\u2019s Landing.\nOne of the great things about this\ngame is that even though ultimately it\nmay not alter your future, every single\npiece of dialogue you select to say\nfeels like it counts. There is no greater\nexample of this than the tense public\nmeeting with the Queen Regent Cersei\nLannister as Mira. As the daughter of\nan ex-bannerman of the \u201ctraitor\u201d Robb\nStark, you are not exactly in Cersei\u2019s\ngood books. Margaery even advises\nyou to say what Cersei wants to hear\ninstead of what you are thinking. I\nkept to her counsel but even so I felt I\nwas making errors at every turn and\nno matter how you start, you will feel\nthe same (\u201cWhen you play the game\nof thrones, you win or you die\u201d always\nlooming over you with each click of the\nmouse).\nThe graphics are not state-of-the-art\nby any means. I felt there were a lot\nof rough edges that could have been\nironed out but this is just nit picking\nand it definitely didn\u2019t ruin my\nenjoyment of the game.\nTo appeal to TV-watchers in\nparticular, the real actors and their\nlikenesses were used and through the\nthree different playable characters\nyou get to meet Cersei and Tyrion\nLannister, Margaery Tyrell and\nRamsay Snow (with the promise of at\nleast Jon Snow in coming episodes).\nThis was a major plus for me. Iwan\nRecently I was sitting in the Felix\noffice absentmindedly jingling\nthe bells (I know sad, right?),\nwhen a fellow section editor sent\nme the link to the game Christmas\nShopping Simulator. This immediately\ngave me purpose in life, and faster\nthan a elf can wrap a present I had\nclicked on the link to the merriment.\nWhat I found there was about as\nmuch fun as a sack of coal.\nIn a blatant attempt to advertise\nitself, the store GAME has released\nthis game in a bid to make fun of all\nthose other quirky little games that\nhave warmed our hearts like goat\nsimulator and surgeon simulator.\nThis is about as cool as the reindeers\nmaking fun of Rudolph for having a\nred nose.\nOh well, I thought to myself,\ngiven that it was free and in fact\nwas Christmas themed, I felt like\nI shouldn\u2019t be the Grinch about it.\nWith an open mind I downloaded\nthis onto one of the Felix machines\nand started shopping away in a\nvirtual mall.\nThe game itself was incredibly\nsimple to use, and I soon got to grips\nwith it. However, it soon became very\napparent how much this Christmas\nShopping Simulator was ripped off\nfrom Goat Simulator. I mean, rag doll\nmode\u2026really?\nThe control themselves were really\nclunky and sometimes I found it\nhard to remember how to actually do\nthings. Furthermore there was the\nseemingly useless ability to fart. Yes,\nyou could actually expel gas (a weird\norange colour!), which served no\nother purpose except try and get some\npity laughs out of you.\nAfter I had gotten over the initial\nsilliness that was the ragdoll mode,\nkicking things around and trying to\nevade the mall cops I attempted to\nactually play this \u2018game\u2019. I started\noff with the missions, but they were\nall pretty repetitive, and the arrow\nabove my head that showed me where\nto go either made it incredibly easy\nor confusing as it would point to\ninaccessible areas of the map.\nThe achievements on the other\nhand weren\u2019t too bad, and I actually\nfound achieving most of them quite\nenjoyable. Sadly there wasn\u2019t actually\nmuch of them, or content in general.\nI think I finished the entire game in\na bit 2 hours, and that includes me\ndicking about.\nWhat I have to say is that this game\nis actually incredibly broken. I found\nseveral ways to completely crash the\ngame, get myself stuck in such ways\nthat I had to restart! Also, the obvious\nadvertising for GAME was really\njarring and put me off playing a bit.\nMy advice is for you give this one\na miss. Even if it is free it really isn\u2019t\nworth the effort. Just go into a game\nstore for the same experience, and\nyou may actually be able to buy a\nproper game!\nRheon\u2019s portrayal of Ramsay Snow\nis perfect in the TV series and his\nperformance in the game is no\ndifferent. His voice and face could\ninstil fear into the hardiest of souls and\nunlike the TV show, you have to choose\nwhat to say to him (and only the seven\ngods know what he\u2019s going to do next).\nThe game is incredible for creating\nimpeccable suspense even in some of\nthe most innocuous of scenes.\nEven though I thoroughly enjoyed\nthis episode and the twists and turns\nthat unfolded, after a bit of research I\nfound there was no way to change the\nultimate (and shocking) ending of the\nepisode.\nYou are told at the beginning of the\ngame that every choice you make will\nhave a significant impact on the events\nthat unfold.\nHowever, no matter how well or\nbadly you play the game there is no\nescaping what is to come. Of course this\nis just a current limitation of game-making technology. Even having two\nor three major endings per episode\nwould require so many different scenes\nto be written and graphically processed\nwhich would just be too expensive.\nGameplay will last about three hours\nper episode and considering you get\nsix of them, I think this sort of game\nis great value for \u00a322.99 (currently on\nSteam).\nWhat is great about this game is\nyou don\u2019t have to be a video game fan\nor particularly any good at them, all\nyou need is a love for a good story told\nwell and if you are a Game of Thrones\nfan (and what the hell are you doing if\nyou\u2019re not?) then this game is definitely\nfor you.\n\"If you are\na Game of\nThrones\nfan then\nthis\ngame is\ndefinitely\nfor you.\"\n\n"

With one\nof our best lineups to date, what more\ncould you ask for?\nGone Girl - 18:00\nGone Girl is not quite the traditional\nmurder-mystery whodunit that it\nseems on the surface. Nick Dunne\n(Ben Affleck) runs a bar in a small\ntown in Missouri and lives in a\nluxury house in the suburbs with his\nbeautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike).\nTheir life seems perfect on the outside\nbut on the day of their 5 wedding\nanniversary, Amy disappears. Blood\nis left at the scene of their home and\nsuspicions fall on Nick who seems\nstrange and unemotional on camera\nbut denies any wrongdoing. As the\npolice race against time to find Amy,\nit soon becomes clear that something\nelse is amiss.\nInterstellar - 21:15\nIf all of your friends have been\nflocking to IMAX theatres, chances\nare there\u2019s only one thing they\u2019ve\nbeen seeing-Christopher Nolan\u2019s\nlatest film Interstellar! Crop blights\nhave decimated the earth and forced\nregression back to an agricultural\nsociety. Former NASA pilot\nCooper (Matthew McConaughey)\nis recruited on one final space\nmission to go through a wormhole\nso that civilization can survive on a\nnew planet. As with all films set in\nspace, their mission is fraught with\ncomplications not to mention the fact\nthat due to relativity, hours in space\nare the same as years on earth which\ntakes its toll on the astronauts and\ntheir relationships with their loved\nones. The result is that, Interstellar is\none of those rare films with spectacle\nand heart in equal measure.\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay\nPart 1 - 00:45\nThe Hunger Games series continues\nas following on from Catching Fire,\nKatniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and the\nrebels of District 13 begin to mount\ntheir rebellion against President\nSnow (Donald Sutherland) and the\nCapitol. Haunted by The Capitol\u2019s\ncapture of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)\nand her inability to do anything\nabout this, Katniss channels her\nfrustration into her new role as \u2018the\nface of the rebellion\u2019 and participates\nin propaganda videos denouncing\nSnow to try and gain support for the\nmovement. The vindictive Snow\nreacts by exacting revenge on Katniss\nand her loved ones.\nNightcrawler - 03:15\nIn the past, Jake Gyllenhaal has\nbeen typecast as a pretty boy due\nto well, his dashing good lucks but\nafter seeing Nightcrawler be prepared\nto see that categorisation well and\ntruly subside. Gyllenhaal loses 30\nlbs (mostly from his morals) to play\nLou Bloom, an unemployed wannabe\nentrepreneur who becomes enticed\nby the world of LA\u2019s nightcrawlers\nwho trawl the streets at night in\norder to shoot footage of the latest\nviolent crimes and car crashes which\nthey then sell to news channels.\nLou quickly rises to the top of\nhis (dubious) profession through\nblackmail, sabotage and practically\nspeaking murder. Those puppy dog\neyes are well and truly gone.\nThe Boxtrolls - 05:30\nTo end on a more uplifting note,\nwe have the stop-motion animated\nfilm The Boxtrolls to guide you into\nmorning. In the fictional town of\nCheesebridge, the subterranean\nBoxtrolls have garnered an unfair\nreputation for kidnapping young kids\nin the middle of the night when in\nfact they are peaceful cardboard-box\nwearing creatures which scavenge\nat night to find materials for their\nlatest inventions. Cheesebridge\u2019s\nmayor strikes a deal with the chief\npest exterminator to rid the town\nof as many boxtrolls as can be and\nboxtrolls soon start disappearing.\nDespite their reclusive nature, the\nboxtrolls and Eggs, their adopted\nhuman friend, work together to\nrehabilitate their image.\nLineup (16/12/14 - 17/12/14):\n18:00: Gone Girl\n21:15: Interstellar\n00:45: Mockingjay - Part 1\n03:15: Nightcrawler\n05:30: The Boxtrolls\nTickets:\nOnline: \u00a310\nOnline with Food: \u00a315\nOn-the-door: \u00a312\nOn-the-door with Food: \u00a317\nSingle Film (on-the-door): \u00a33\nThe \u00a35 additional food ticket buys\nyou all-you-can-eat hot food and\ndrink throughout the night.\nCan\u2019t make the whole night?\nTickets for individual films will be on\nsale on the door for \u00a33 each.

ICRFL, keen\nfor their first run out of the season,\nattended in full kit striking fear into\nthe hearts of the lions.\nThe day started with a joint training\nsession, and a Cambridge plot to tire\nthe IC players with some fitness, but\nreserves held and the session moved\nto skills based play. Having travelled\nwith a small squad of players ICRFL\nfound themselves short a dummy\nhalf and stand-off, but confident of\ntheir passing abilities the positions\nwere quickly filled by a prop and\nsecond row.\nIn awe of the accuracy of the\npassing skills of ICRFL\u2019s forwards the\nGreen Lions started the main event, a\n9s match. The game featured fantastic\nperformances from the IC freshers.\nNew to the sport, and concerned\nabout the size of the players on the\nopposing team, Joe Dai perfected\nhis sidestep, dancing around some\nCambridge players before scoring an\noutstanding individual try. Other\nnotable performances came from\nAndy making some exceptional\nsupporting runs on our Captain,\nwhile Pavol found his skillset as an\ninsurmountable defensive mountain.\nThe day finished with socialising\nin the club house, an invitation\nto ICRFL for special access to the\nCambridge vs Oxford Varsity, and\nLiverpool,\nTiger\nWoods and\ndoping \u2013 the\nWorld Sport\nColumn\nLiverpool saw their Champions\nLeague dreams end with a 1-1\ndraw against Basel.

The satisfaction\nthat you get from turning a lump of\ndull metal into something useful or\nbeautiful, and on the rare occasion\nboth, is incomparable to anything\nelse!\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, a skill like this\nis very tiring and difficult to master\nand as such, coupled with modern\nmanufacturing, it is a profession that\nis dwindling.\nI have been lucky enough to have\nthe opportunity to volunteer as a\n17th\ncentury blacksmith at a first\nperson re-enactment village where I\nhave been able to develop my basic\nunderstanding of metalwork. It also\ngave the challenge of working with\nperiod tools which means no power\nhammers, no electricity, etc. just the\nsheer will and man-power to heat a\npiece of iron to 800o\nC and then bash,\nbend and bully it into the desired\nshape and size.\nOver the few years that I have been\n\u201cAre you fucking mental\naltogether?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you Brian, I\u2019ll kill you \u2014 I\u2019m\nnot joking.\u201d\nAn ambitious and creative\nproduction, ROAD presents\na bleak look at Thatcherite\nBritain in a northern town. The\nplay leads us through the lives of\nthe residents on a typical gin-soaked\nFriday night \u2013 from immediate and\nbrutal violence to bawdy drunkenness\nand heartbreaking fragility. Almost\nthirty years after its debut, this\nplay has lost little of its ability to\nshock an audience. Jim Cartwright\u2019s\nvoyeuristic exhibit of the warts and\nall goings on of this single street\nreflect the resentment and very real\nfear of poverty felt in the hard hit\nnorth at the time, not so far from\nthe imaginations of this recession\u2019s\ngeneration.\nThese relentlessly grim lives with\na sometimes fatal lack of hope for\nthe future play out with unremitting\nrealism. Bare lightbulbs cast stark\nlight and moody shadows on a series\nof brightly wallpapered rooms that\nsurround the audience. This created\nworld extends into the interval\nwhere the audience is drawn into the\ndebauchery of this long and drunken\nnight.\nJumpsuits, shoulderpads, Dr\nMartens and double denim coupled\nwith an aggressively eighties musical\nbackdrop transport the audience to\na forgotten era. All this creates an\nimmersive theatre experience that\nsucceeds in bringing the audience\ninto the centre of the lives of the\nROAD residents.\nThe ensemble cast deliver\nsome nuanced and convincing\nperformances, with countless\nstand-out monologues in this epic of\ngrimness and austerity. Our narrator\nand anti-hero, Scullery, first played\nby Ian Dury of Hit Me With Your\nRythm Stick fame is here taken on in\nall its leering grotesque glory with\nfresh energy by Oscar Gill.\nAdam Lawrence\u2019s performance as\nSkin-Lad was particularly polished\nas he successfully captured the\naudience with his stage presence\nand intense physical rage. An\nunparalleled commitment to the role\nsaw Lawrence embrace skin-head\nauthenticity by actually shaving off\nhis majestic golden locks of flowing\nshoulder-length hair.\nAndrew Finn brings a sickeningly\nvivid depiction of helplessness,\nanguish and bitterness as his\ncharacter Joey struggles to come to\nterms with life\u2019s lack of meaning.\nThis anger is accompanied by Lizzie\nRiach\u2019s romantically fatalistic\nClare, cutting a pitiful figure as she\ngradually fades away.\nThe final scene epitomises the\nuneasy emptiness of the lives we\u2019ve\nglimpsed on ROAD, with Emma\nLittle as the mouthy and world-weary\nCarol and the haunting pain and\nchilling desperation of Hasan AlHabib as Eddie.\nThe pathos of Brink and Louise,\nplayed by Steven Kingaby and Issy\nLucas respectively, complemented\nthe scene perfectly as these four\nThis is basically blacksmithing.

The inquiry\nset out to look at the changes a new\nimmigration bill would have on\nstudents who come from abroad to\nstudy, which would include charging\npeople a flat fee to access healthcare.\nWe said goodbye to the Science\nMuseum Library, with the collection\non the third floor being moved\noutside of campus and the space\nrenovated for students to study\nin. The Union also announced the\nrefurbishment of the Union Concert\nHall with a \u00a3220,000 grant, although\nthis was not to be completed in time\nfor the next academic year.\nYoYo hit campus with its bright\npink payment app, and bars all over\ncampus braced themselves for the\nnumerous technical difficulties that\nfollowed before accepting this new\nway of payment and for some, a new\nway of life. One student told us \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike we aren\u2019t even really paying, so\nI spend quite a lot of money at sport\nnights now.\u201d\nIt came to light that the Chemistry\nbuilding may be moving to the\nImperial West campus, something\nthat is still being planned and\nprepared for now although the\nmoving date has yet to be set.\nImperial joined together with\nthe best vacuum cleaner company\naround, Dyson, to launch a\nnew robotics laboratory in the\nDepartment of Computing. The\nlab does not however carry out\nresearch to develop new, innovative\ncleaning products but instead looks at\nexpanding artificial intelligence.\nMeanwhile, students in the library\nwere caught mining bitcoins late at\nnight, and were promptly banned by\nthe ICT department.\nIn March we saw the Medics win\nthe Rugby, but College to win overall.\nImperial hit 13th in the Times Higher\nEducation rankings, still 11 places\nshy of where it would reach in the QS\nRankings in a few months time.\nIt was announced that Evelyn\nGardens would close in 2015, and\nit was not clear if the halls would\nopen again. It was also announced\nthat the library would finally get air\nconditioning, only for this glimmer\nof hope to be snatched away.\nIt was revealed that although\nplanning permission was granted to\nbuild the cooling system, funding\nwas never awarded to pay for the\ncomplete electrical and mechanical\noverhaul needed for the library to be\nable to sustain the system.\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all bleak news:\nImperial received a \u00a340 million\ndonation from alumnus Michael\nUren to build a new Bioengineering\nbuilding at the Imperial West\nCampus. Uren graduated before Felix\neven existed, in 1943.\nAlthough Bioengineering may have\nbeen having a great time, Medicine\nsaw the doors shut on its four-year\npostgraduate course, introducing\na new five-year course instead for\ngraduate entrants.\nMedics were also left displeased\nwhen they heard their sports grounds,\nTeddington, were to be closed and\nall sport was moving to Heston.\nAccording to those involved, the\nfollowing summer months were\nplagued with miscommunication\nissues about the closure.\nFelix returned for the new\nacademic year as Alice Gast succeeded\nRector Keith O\u2019Nions to become the\nfirst President of Imperial College.\nShe is the 16th head of the University.\nCheerfully, the home office dropped\nallegations of animal cruelty at\nImperial. Out of 180 allegations from\nthe British Union for the Abolition of\nVivisection, only five were upheld.\nTeddington held its final day of\nsport in October, a few weeks after the\nnew intake started back at Imperial,\nand although a Dri night at the Union\nwas scheduled in the first fortnight of\nterm, some were left unimpressed by\nthe turnout.\nThere was controversy as Felix\nrevealed that the College had cut\namenities funds for halls by more\nthan half. The amenities fund was cut\nfrom roughly \u00a3373,000 to just over\n\u00a3150,000.\nThe first of two controversies\ninvolving the rugby teams hit on\nHalloween (we\u2019ll never forgive you\nguys for knocking the pumpkin off\nthe front page). The Rugby First\nXV were caught stripping on tube\nplatforms, while medics were caught\nrunning around Heston naked. The\nfollowing week, the Medics rugby\nclub was suspended for smashing a\ncoach window whilst on tour.\nA petition was launched against\npotential redevelopment work\nat Silwood Park, although it\nremains unclear what exactly the\nredevelopment would entail. It also\nremains unclear whether the project\nwill go ahead.\nAt the end of November,\nBlackboard crashed during an online\nexam. As many as 450 students were\nleft \u201cconfused and frustrated\u201d, as the\ntest at the Business School had to be\nhalted and disaster swept through the\ndepartment.\nMeanwhile, the Higher Education\nFunding policy was garnering online\nsupport, although the same could not\nbe said for the Bursary change, which\nwas \u201ccondemned\u201d by Union Council.\nThe Union attempted to hold\na General Meeting about Higher\nEducation Funding at the start of\nDecember, but the meeting failed\nto meet quorum. Only 45 people\nattended the meeting, some way short\nof the 200 required.\nThe sad news of Professor Grimm\u2019s\ndeath made it onto the front page\nlast week, and it seems the story is far\nfrom over. We may be able to provide\nmore information in 2015, so watch\nthis space.\nMany of our main stories from this\nyear have yet to reach a conclusion,\nso we will be following up on these in\nthe New Year. Don\u2019t forget to pick up\nyour copy of Felix on the first Friday\nof the Spring term.\nKUNAL WAGLE\nSECTION EDITOR\n\"It\u2019s like\nwe aren\u2019t\neven really\npaying,\nso I spend\nquite a lot\nof money\nat sport\nnights\nnow.\"\n\"Don\u2019t\nforget to\npick up\nyour copy\nof Felix on\nthe first\nFriday of\nthe Spring\nterm.\"\nSadly no snow for you this year, but a Merry Christmas from everyone here at Felix!

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 27\n12.12.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor: Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfrom the Commonwealth of Nations,\na ban that would last for three\nyears; in 2001 it emerged that two\nwitnesses had been bribed by Shell\nto give false evidence at the trial; in\nDecember 2003 Shell admitted that\n\u201cwe sometimes feed conflict by the\nway we award contracts, gain access\nto land, and deal with community\nrepresentatives\u201d; and in 2009 they\noffered the family of Saro-Wiwa\n$15.5 million in damages. They still\ndeny any wrongdoing.\nIt is clear that neither Shell\nnor BP have any qualms about\ndestroying both the environment\nand people\u2019s lives in their quest for\nfurther profit. Indeed, despite the\nfact that research has found that\nthe two companies are responsible\nfor 4.59% of all CO2 emissions since\n1750, both are now expanding their\noperations in Canadian tar sands\nand exploring the novel technology\nof fracking. When the Tate, or any\nother organisation, accepts money\nfrom such an organisation, they are\nimplicitly giving their approval of\nthat company\u2019s activities.\nIn essence, The Tate Foundation\nis acting as a PR company for\nBP, hiding their less-than-savory\npractices under a thin veneer of\n\u2013 that most patronising of terms \u2013\npublic outreach. When one looks at\nthe economic argument it is small\nwonder that BP decide to sponsor\nthe Tate: as of last year Deepwater\nhad cost BP $42.2 billion, with a\nrecent decision from the Supreme\nCourt that BP were negligent\npossibly costing them a further $18\nbillion in the future; for a mere \u00a310\nmillion, spread around a number\nof UK institutions, BP can gain\napproval from the UK public. It used\nto be that arms manufacturers and\ntobacco companies sponsored artistic\nventures (the BP Portrait Prize at\nthe National Portrait Gallery used to\nbe sponsored by Imperial Tobacco),\nand yet now the immorality of such\nbodies means accepting funding from\nthem is beyond the pale; why is this\nnot the same for oil companies?\nThe approval from artistic bodies\nneed not be implicit either; Tate\ndirector Nicholas Serota has made his\nsupport for oil perfectly clear since\nthe 1980s when he, as director of\nWhitechapel Gallery, first entered\ninto agreements with BP. Following\nDeepwater, he made such sentiments\neven more obvious, refusing to\ncapitulate to mounting pressure from\nactivists: \u201cWe all recognise they have\na difficulty at the moment\u201d, he said,\n\u201cbut you don\u2019t abandon your friends\nbecause they have what we consider\nto be a temporary difficulty.\u201d Such\nloyalty is admirable, but perhaps\nmisplaced, especially when one\nconsiders that the current Chair of\nTrustees at the Tate Foundation is\nLord Browne, former CEO of BP\nfrom 1995-2007, and current owner\nof fracking company Cuadrilla\nResources.\nFor some, this level of intimacy\nbetween the arts and big business is\nnot worrying. British artist Jeremy\nDeller, who represented the UK at\nthe last Venice Biennale, sees the\nrelationship as inevitable, saying that\n\u201cart has always had links to power,\nbusiness, and politics\u201d. This may be\nso, but with the increasing reach of\ninternational companies, it doesn\u2019t\nseem paranoid to be concerned\nabout the impact they could have\non what enters the gallery. In 2011,\nenvironmental artist Chris Drury had\na work removed from the University\nof Wyoming; entitled Carbon Sink,\nit featured a whirlpool of blackened\nlogs on a base of coal, and acted\nas a comment on the devastating\nimpact of the coal industry on\nthe state\u2019s forests. Following an\noutcry from Wyoming\u2019s powerful\ncoal lobby, which was soon echoed\nby state politicians, the piece was\nremoved, less than a year after it was\ncommissioned.\nThis may be an extreme example,\nbut while BP hasn\u2019t \u2013 thus far \u2013\nremoved works from Tate\u2019s galleries\noutright, the level at which they\ncensor material may be more\ninsidious. This is a sentiment echoed\nby playwright Mark Ravenhill:\n\u201cIf you spend night after night\nentertaining corporates, you learn\ntheir language\u201d, he says, \u201cIt becomes\nharder to talk to the whole of society.\nI think there are very few examples of\ndirect intervention \u2013 it\u2019s not like you\nsend them a script and see if they like\nit. But it changes the culture. It\u2019s more\ngradual than censorship.\u201d\nWhen considering the extreme\nsecrecy that surrounds the Tate\nFoundation\u2019s dealings with BPdespite the fact that 40% of their\nfunding is from governmental\nsources \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem at all\nfeckless to question what influence\nthey may have over what is inside the\ngalleries.\nUltimately, whenever a discussion\nconcerns big oil and the arts, people\nare made to face a choice; would you\nwant BP to stop sponsoring the Tate,\nif it meant they would no longer\nbe able to function due to lack of\nfunds? I don\u2019t doubt the importance\nthat arts has in this country, both\neconomically and socially, and for me\nencouraging access to the arts is one\nof the most vital things a government\ncan do (despite the opinions of\nSecretary of State for Education\nNicky Morgan, who believes \u201cthe arts\nhold kids back\u201d), but this choice of oil\nor nothing is false.\nInstead, there is a third way, which\nwould involve the government\ndramatically reversing the arts cuts\nthey have put in place thus far, and\nextending the funding available to\nthe Arts Council. In the most recent\ngovernmental budget for the arts,\nthe Southbank Centre, National\nTheatre, and Royal Shakespeare\nCompany all faced cuts, ENO\nfunding was slashed by 29%, and\nBarbican funding cut by 18%.\nWhen such pressures are placed on\ninstitutions, it is understandable that\nthey may look for funding anywhere\nthey can get it, be it from oil\ncompanies or financial powerhouses.\nBut it also encourages a new\nparadigm, in which the state refuses\nto support the arts; a process has\nbeen put in place \u2013 starting two\ndecades ago but significantly ramped\nup in the last five years \u2013 by which\narts funding is thought of as an\nunnecessary luxury, despite the fact\nthat they are economically sound\ninvestments, returning \u00a34 for each \u00a31\ninvested.\nAs the world becomes more\nand more interconnected, and\nenvironmental issues such as climate\nchange move to the forefront of\npeople\u2019s minds, it seems likely that it\nwill become increasingly difficult for\ncompanies such as BP to defend their\nactivities. The interaction between\npolitics and the arts is becoming\nincreasingly unsettling, and people\nare beginning to take notice; in the\nwake of the recent Israeli-Palestine\nconflict the Sao Paulo Biennale\ndropped the logo of the Israeli\nEmbassy from their programme, and\nNorth London\u2019s Tricycle Theatre\nrefused to host the UK Jewish\nFilm Festival until the organisers\nreturned sponsorship from the Israeli\nEmbassy.\nLast September, Liberate Tate\nstaged a performance piece in the\nTate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall;\nentitled Hidden Figures, they held\nup a giant black square, inspired by\nthe Malevich painting on display\nat the time, in protest against the\ncensorship of information regarding\nthe sponsorship deals with BP. As\nanti-oil sentiment becomes more and\nmore apparent, it seems likely that\nsuch protests are the tip of a huge\niceberg with which the Titanic of big\noil is on a direct collision course. The\nonly question now is whether The\nTate Foundation will go down with\nthe ship.\n\"In essence,\nThe Tate\nFoundation\nis acting\nas a PR\ncompany\nfor BP\"\nLiberate Tate members protesting against censorship from BP, 2014\nPhoto: Martin LeSanto-Smith\nDeepwater Horizon drilling platform going up in flames, 2010 Photo: Creative Commons\n\"There\nis a new\nparadigm\nby which\nthe state\nrefuses to\nsupport the\narts\"\n\n"

Farage\nis the \u201cturkey who would vote for\nChristmas\u201d, and is keen to downsize\nthe public sector.\nFarage\u2019s remarks are dangerously\nclose to libertarianism: a political\nmovement that has at its roots the\nlack of government. Recently, this\nideology has taken an upturn in\npopularity, as people question the\nmoral validity of the state.\nLibertarians argue for the \u201czero\naggression principle\u201d: the idea that\naggression or acts of violence should\nbe avoided at all costs. Since the\ngovernment enforces tax payments,\nThe Economics Column: Government\nTaxation under the microscope\nSAMUEL BODANSKY\nCOMMENT WRITER\nif an individual does not pay their\ntaxes, people view the government\nas an immoral institution and think\nthat it should thus have a small a role\nas possible, perhaps not even existing.\nThe ideal for libertarians is an\nanarcho-capitalist society, where all\ntrade is conducted on a free market\nwith no government intervention.\nThis means no taxes, and no public\nexpenditure on roads or hospitals.\nWhile it is possible to be blinded\nby the moral rhetoric of libertarians,\ntheir world view is neither realistic\nnor economically viable.\nCertain markets provide items,\nsuch as tobacco and pollution, that\nare classed as \u2018demerit goods\u2019. These\nare over consumed by the free market\ndue to a lack of information. If the\npeople knew how damaging these\nthings were, they would be consumed\nless. It is the government\u2019s job to use\nprices to cut tobacco usage by using\na \u2018Pigovian\u2019 tax (one which is applied\nto a market activity that is generating\nnegative externalities), increasing the\nprice of tobacco.\nThe government can redistribute\nthe taxation income from the demerit\ngood on a long term project to help\nthe economy.\nOther goods are \u2018public\u2019; they fall to\nthe \u2018free rider\u2019 principle. For example,\nif my neighbour buys a missile\ndefence system, I will not need to buy\none because they have protected me\nat no personal charge.\nMany items, such as roads\nand the military, are necessary,\nbut no one would pay for them\nindividually because of this problem.\nGovernments possess the ability to\nenforce payment so that these vital\nservices are provided.\nAlso, we know that the \u2018invisible\nhand\u2019 of the market can turn into\na fist. Monopolies can often form\nand increase prices for individuals.\nThis is market failure; government\nregulation is a vital way of preventing\nmonopoly and market collusion, to\nkeep prices low for the general public.\nLibertarianism\u2019s key premise \u2013\nthat violence is never the answer\n\u2013 fails because people often do not\nknow what is best for them. Good\ngovernments help provide a stable\ninfrastructure, that allows big\nbusiness to flourish, and regulates\nthem, to prevent abuse of the market.\nWe need government more than ever\nin these difficult economic times.\nJust how divided is our Union?\nImperial College Union is vast. It\nhas 344 different societies, and\nevery year they collectively turn\nover \u00a32 million. The entire Union\nturns over \u00a37 million. There are 3000\ndifferent society committee positions\nand 40% of undergraduate students\nare a member of at least one club or\nsociety.\nThis is great for participation\n\u2013 but it ironically means there is\na huge divide between the paid\nsabbatical \u2018Officer Trustees\u2019 at the\ntop and the average society goer, I\ncount four layers of management\nto the president: Member \u2013 Society\nPresident \u2013 Management Group\nChair \u2013 Deputy President for Clubs,\nSocieties & Projects \u2013 President ( \u2013\nCouncil \u2013 Trustees). So many times I\nhear students talk about \u2018the Union\u2019\nas if it\u2019s this distant party-pooping\nfun police mafia, which gets its kicks\nout of charging entry to Metric,\nsending emails every other day, and\nbanning any event involving alcohol.\nIn the latest high profile example,\na club president actively lied to\nthe sabbatical team about a police\ninvestigation, because they felt that\nwas the best way to protect their\nmembers. Ironically, this was the\nworst possible thing to do because\nwhen the police come knocking \u2013 the\npresident is the first person they go\nto. If stories don\u2019t match up, clubs can\nget shut down.\nThe union sabbaticals did the\nabsolute best they could to protect\nthose in the rugby club who recently\ndid wrong and the club as a whole,\nwithholding names from public\ndocuments and giving out severe\nenough sanctions to prevent further\npunishment from College, the Police\nor the Rugby Union Federation.\nThese efforts were successful, but\ntheir success was threatened by the\ndishonesty internally about what had\nhappened.\nThis is ridiculous. We are shooting\nourselves in the foot. It brings up\nissues of society president training,\nbut we all have to work as a team.\nThe sabbaticals need to connect\nwith students, and be accessible.\nI don\u2019t mean sitting on a desk in\nthe JCR, glumly staring at the pie\nstand. I mean leaving the union\nbuilding, crashing the odd Cheese\nSoc gathering; going to Harlington,\nbeing part of clubs and trying to be\nsomeone you\u2019d actually want to talk\nto. Maybe each of the sports teams\nshould adopt a sabb at the next ACC\nnight? You can\u2019t follow a leadership\nwho don\u2019t interact.\nBut it\u2019s not just the sabbs who\nThis year's sabbatical officers: Pascal Loose (DPE), Tom Wheeler (President), Abi de Bruin (DPCS), Alex Savell\n(DPFS) and Chris Kaye (DPW).

Tell\nPascal your course rep doesn\u2019t give a\ntoss, or tell Alex your club president\nkeeps complaining about not having\nenough money. Or just complain\nabout Metric.\nThis is a union, but it\u2019s sheer size\nmeans it\u2019s becoming fragmented. It\u2019s\ndown to every member to prevent\nthat happening and the leadership\nneeds to lead it.\n\"We are shooting\nourselves in the\nfoot\"\n\n"

From the Arab Spring\nacross Syria, Libya and Egypt to the\nrecent protests in Ferguson and New\nYork against police brutality, protest\nhas spread to all corners of the world.\nThe Disobedient Objects exhibition\ncurrently at the V&A is a collection\nof badges, banners and placards\nthat have played an integral part\nin protests across the world in the\n20th\ncentury. The Porter Gallery\nhas been injected with a touch of\nthe revolutionary spirit, with seven\nmetre high carbon fibre gallery doors\nemulate barricades made iconic by\nthe French Revolution. Colourful\nbanners, the largest of which declares\n\u201cCapitalism is Crisis\u201d in vivid peacock\nhues, give the air of a renegade camp;\nscreens throughout the gallery project\nshow scenes from demonstrations\nand protests, the chants clashing and\nharmonising to create a space unlike\nany other.\nSo what exactly is meant by \u2018objects\nof disobedience\u2019? The consensus is\nthat they are items that have joined a\nmovement together, allowing people\nfrom all walk to life to connect with\ncauses beyond their own experience.\nBut the exhibition is keen to point\nout that there is no \u2018protest aesthetic\u2019.\nThe tokens that become iconic of a\nparticular cause are determined by\nthe context of the communities in\nwhich they are formed. Folk art or a\nparticular phrase can be translated\ninto a brand and circulated with\ntechnology. This is something we are\nseeing more and more of, recently\n#Icantbreathe went viral on Twitter\nas people all around the world took\nto the internet to voice their dismay\nat a grand jury failing to indict the\npolice officer who was filmed putting\nEric Garner in an illegal chokehold\nin New York earlier this year; \u201cI can\u2019t\nbreathe\u201d is repeated by Garner 11\ntimes as the officer tries to restrain\nhim, before harrowingly falling\nsilent.\nIn the critical essay The Frontiers\nof Art and Propaganda George Orwell\nwrites \u201cyou cannot take a purely\naesthetic interest in a disease you\nare dying from; you cannot feel\ndispassionately about a man who\nis about to cut your throat\u201d. Orwell\nwrites about the death of pure\naestheticism, the end of creating\nart for art\u2019s sake. There have been\nnumerous examples of art that\ndisguise a political agenda. The\nquestion that gripped me whilst\nwalking through Disobedient Objects:\ncan the objects of propaganda ever\nbe Art?\nIt all comes down to how we define\nart. For me, there must be some\naesthetic element; all pieces of iconic\nart have the power to command\nthe viewer\u2019s attention and remain\nin the viewer\u2019s mind. The power of\npropaganda lies in how quickly the\nidea spreads and is taken up, and\nhaving a strong symbol that binds\nprotesters together is an important\npart of achieving this. One of the\nmost poignant example is that of the\npink triangle that formed ACT UP\u2019s\n\u2018Silence=Death\u2019 campaign, which\naimed to fight homophobia and\ninaction during the AIDS crisis in the\n1980s; they inverted the symbol used\nin Nazi concentration camps to mark\nout gay men as a call to arms.\nImages often lead the vanguard\nof political protests. Protesters\nopposing the expansion of Heathrow\nAirport used shields portraying\nfaces of villagers across the world in\nplaces such as Bangladesh, seeking to\ndraw attention to the human costs\nof climate change. In 2011, as Italy\nfaced education budget cuts, students\ntook to the streets carrying huge\ncardboard and Plexiglas versions of\nclassic book covers used as shields to\npush back against the police batons\nand charges. In 2011 the London\nBook Bloc campaign released a\nstatement saying \u201cwhen the police\nbaton us\u2026 we will see not only police\nviolence against individuals but the\nstate\u2019s violence against free thought,\nexpression and learning\u2026 books are\nour tools, we teach with them, we\nlearn with them, we create with them,\nand sometimes we must fight with\nthem.\u201d\nIt is exactly this sort of passion\nthat elevates protest emblems into a\ntype of art. Increasingly in art what\nmatters is the concept \u2013 Banksy in\nparticular is infamous for blending\nstrong political ideals with his street\nart. The blurring of the boundaries\nbetween art and propaganda has\n\"They\nare items\nthat join a\nmovement\ntogether,\nallowing\npeople to\nconnect\nwith causes\"\nalready started to happen at the\nhighest echelons of art.\nOne of the leaders of this\nmovement are a group of anonymous\nAmerican female artists who\ncall themselves the Guerrilla\nGirls . Branding themselves \u201cthe\nconscience of the art world\u201d they\nhave been exposing sexual and racial\ndiscrimination in the art world since\ntheir inception in 1984. The group\u2019s\nmembers wear gorilla masks in public\nto protect their identities and subvert\nthe objectification of female artists\nthat still takes place in the art world.\nOne of their most famous pieces, now\non exhibition at the Tate, depicts a\nRokeby Venus-esque nude wearing a\ngorilla mask alongside the statement\n\u201cDo women have to be naked to get\ninto the Met. Museum? \u2013 less than\n5% of the artists in the modern arts\nsection are women, but 85% of the\nnudes are female\u201d, protesting the lack\nof equal representation.\nSuch a bare political statement\nbeing exhibited as art in one of the\nhighest regarded galleries in the\nworld echoes Bertolt Brecht: \u201cart is\nnot a mirror to reflect the world,\nrather it is a hammer to shape it\u201d.\nArt is about an enduring concept,\nand more importantly, a passion that\ntranscends the artist and infects the\nviewer. There is no more immediate\nand powerful way to try and capture\nthis sentiment, to try to shape the\nworld, than protest.\nThe image of crowds marching and\noften chanting in unison can seem\nlike performance art on an epic scale.\nBut to lump the two in the same\ncategory would be dishonest. True\nprotest, the act of going back onto the\nstreets despite risk to life and liberty,\ncarries with it dangers that art rarely\never does. Even as the ideas of art and\nprotest intertwine, it would be wrong\nto class protest entirely as art.\nIt is tempting to try to beautify\nprotest; it is easy for us to regard the\nspirit of revolution as something\ninherently romantic, to glamorise\nthe overthrow of despotic regimes\nby civilians. It is this need to create\nsuch a poetic theme that plagued\nthe broadcast of the Arab Spring by\nmainstream media. Catalina Ferro\u2019s\nManifesto puts it better than I ever\ncould:\n\u201cI know what the price of smashing\nthe system really is, my people already\ntried that./The price of uprise is paid in\nblood/And not Harvard blood\u2026./It is easy\nto say \u201crevolution\u201d from the comfort of\na New England library./It is easy to offer\nflesh to the cause/When it is not yours\nto give.\u201d\nDisobedient Objects is on at the V&A\nuntil 1st\nFebruary 2015.

Naturally, it is considered\none of the most important aspects of\nstudent-based politics and therefore\none of the most important items of\nstudent union\u2019s political agenda.\nThe previous Higher Education\nFunding Policy lapsed on 31st July\n2014 (Union policies automatically\nexpire after three years), so for over\nfour months Imperial College Union\nhad no official stance on Higher\nEducation Funding: many on Council\nreportedly found this concerning. It\nwas also considered imperative that\na policy be decided before the end of\nterm, so that campaigning can begin\nwell before the general election in\nMay 2015.\nThe two papers up for discussion\nat the meeting, one proposed by\nDPFS Alex Savell and one proposed\nby Natural Sciences PG Ordinary\nMember Andrew Tranter, were not\nsignificantly different from those\ntabled at the inquorate General\nMeeting conducted on Monday 1st\nDecember.\nSavell\u2019s paper referred to the\nrecommendations made in the HEF\nSurvey Analysis, which can be read\non the Union website. The main\ncampaign objectives were: to reverse\nthe increase in tuition fees from\n\u00a33,000 to \u00a39,000 per year, to reduce\nmarketisation of higher education,\nto introduce regulation of Overseas\nand Postgraduate course fees, and to\nincrease the amount of government\nsupport (loans and grants) given to\naddress cost of living.\nTranter\u2019s proposal called on the\nUnion to \u201csupport and actively\ncampaign for free, funded, and\naccessible higher education\u201d and\ncalled on the Union to \u201ccondemn\u201d\ntuition fee rises and increasing\nmarketisation of universities in\naddition to campaigning against\nthem.\nThe five resolutions were voted on\nseparately: two which would have\nchanged the Union\u2019s stance to a pro-free-education one failed, and three\nwhich strengthened the language\nused in Savell\u2019s paper passed.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased that we have a policy\nthat is reflective of the views of\nstudents\u201d, says Savell. \u201cWe have a\nposition to work from and can enlist\nUnion staff support.\u201d\nWhen asked about the role of\nImperial College itself, he said:\n\u201cwhere they agree with us, College will\nhelp\u201d, but that there are some areas\nof \u201cinevitable conflict\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why\nwe have a students\u2019 union!\u201d Imperial\u2019s\nmanagement style is often criticised\nas being overly commercial, Savell\nexplains that this is due to the \u201cunfair\nsystem\u201d of marketisation: \u201cWe want\nstructural change.\u201d\nICU\u2019s new policy is unusual for a\nstudent union policy in that it does\nnot call for scrapping tuition fees.\n\u201cHistorically, I believe that we are\none of the more conservative student\nunions\u201d, explains Savell. \u201cBut we\u2019re\ndefinitely less conservative than\nthe Conservative Party!\u201d Savell\nbelieves that the policy could still\ngain traction with Conservative\nparliamentary candidates: \u201cImperial\nstudents comprise future business\nleaders\u2026.people with considerable\neconomic impact. These are the sort\nof people the Conservatives target.\u201d\nUnion staff and Officer Trustees\nwill be meeting today (Friday) to\ndiscuss the next specific steps of the\ncampaign. The Union will be looking\nto \u201cengage the student population\nand get them active\u201d, but Savell\nstresses that campaign efforts will go\nahead even in the case of a lukewarm\nresponse from the student body:\n\u201cThey\u2019ve told us what they want, and\nit\u2019s our job to go and implement it.\u201d\nImperial College Union to campaign\nfor tuition fees in newly passed policy\nJASPER MENKUS\nWRITER\nIs your degree worth it?\nThere\u2019s still time to tell us:\nwww.felixonline.co.uk/survey\n\"The main\ncampaign\nobjectives\nwere: to\nreverse the\nincrease in\ntuition fees,\nto reduce\nmarketisation\nof higher\neducation...\"\n\n"
