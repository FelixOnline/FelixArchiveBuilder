    "content": "2 FELIX\nCOMMENT\nMy term of office as Editor of Felix \"began prematurely on Friday,27 th May\nwith the resignation of Ian Williams. The\nday before, at the IC Union Meeting, he was\nattached in a letter read by Mr. Fain for having printed an article concerning RCS\nUnion finances which was alleged to be mischievous and factually in corre et,A. Fletcher, IC President, should not have allowed the reading of this letter. It contained a vague description of RCSU's financial position, \u20ac750 left, but also attached Ian Williams personally as being\nresponsible for a' a mischievous and factually wrong article' and questioned his integrity and ability. This came at a time which was calculated to influence voting in the following election for Deputy President, in which Ian was standing,\nbut at no time was he permitted to defend\nhimself.\nThe main purpose of this issue is to bring to our readers' attention the present state of RCSU's finances and correct those who might have been misled by the\noriginal article. Nobody has quibbled\nwith the figures given in that article, only the conclusions reached. The new\nfigures were eventually provided by President Scott. However, they were pro vi ded late because despite repeated promises\nto allow Felix to see the accounts he has\nbeen most elusive, relenting only at the\neleventh hour.\nVarious points emerge from this fracas. Clearly RCSU executive have been overspending over the last year with very\nlittle control. This the ordinary members\nof the Union did not know and, but for the\nFelix report and the subsequent Extraordi nary Union Meeting would neve x have\nknown. Therefore Felix has brought out\ninto the open some dubious spending which\nwould otherwise undoubtedly ha-ve been\ncovered up by the executive concerned. It was unfortunate that the article jumped\nto some wrong conclusions. If there had\nb den co-operation between F eli r x and Mr.\nScott the whole ugly badness need never\nhave occurred. It is essential that good\nrelations shoji ld be kept between Felix and\nUnions executive in order that harmful\nmisunderstandings should not take place.\n*RC3 Union have in fact passed a motion\nrequesting more co-operation next year, so\nthey have c learnt and so have Felix. LETTER TO THE EDITOR\nSir,I should just like to point out\nthrough your columns* that my sudden decision to hand over the Editorship of this newspaper at midnight on Thursday, 26th May was based not on any sense of guilt, but on the proximity of em min at j ons. I regret having burdened yo p with this resp on sibi lit yat such a time*\nI deeply regret that Mr. Pain was\nmisquoted in error. At the time of writing this letter( Saturday) no facts have\nbeen brought to light to disprove the\nfinancial basis in the story I published\nthe last issue concerning the finances of\nRCS Union. I was as shocked as anyone\nelse at the letter presented to Thursday's IC Union Annual General Meeting by Mr. S.J. Pain, the RCSU Treasurer - the more so\nsince I had been previously assured by\nthe Chairman of the Meeting that it was to bring to light facts about RCSU fina noes which would show the FELIX story to be at variances. This it did not, being merely\na personal attack, calculated to be particularly injurious at that time.\nMr. Pain was wrong in his claim that\nhe had no opportunity for reply in the\ncolumns df FELIX before October. On a matter of such import the FELIX Staff can\nbe relied upon to produce, not by any\nmeans for the first time, a special issue*\nAt any other time in the year I should\npersonally have seen that the whole argument was cleared up j now, for me at lea^ academic work must take absolute preference\nIn view of the contents of the letter and of his earlier discussion with FELIX\nStaff the President of the Union sr hould have again consulted the FELIX Staff bef ore the Meeting over the right to reply. The FELIX correspondence columns always\nallow this right to reply; Mr. Fletcher did not permit such at the Union Meeting.\nD.I. WILLIAMS\nex-Editor, FELIX.\nFELIX\nEDITOR: P.M. COMBES\nALSO: J. Cawson, A. J. Firshman,\nFreda Moon.\nPublished by P.M. Combes on behalf of the FELIX BQaHD, Imperial College, S.W.7., and p fr in ted by F.D. S. "

Mr. Mair, asking\nCouncil for approval to spend the necessary cash said that following the reso-lu tion passed at the IC Union Meeting on\nMay 26th calling on him to investigate the means test itv/ as planned to question\n300-500 students.\n'Other points to emerge from one of the\nshortest joint Council meetings -were a. grant of \u00a340 p.a. to the Constituent\nCollege Presidents towards their Hall bills, and the point that the Rector has\nagreed to a lump sum. payment to IC Union\ntide over its difficulties next year\nbefore the increase in the per capita grant becomes possible in196768. Adrian Fletcher announced that the\nsurplus made by the IC Carnival this year\nwas some \u00a31,500. This puts Carnival back\nto 1962 since when totals of \u00a31,673*\n\u00a32,211 & \u00a32,4.17 were collected.. Chris\nHocking, this year's Carnival Chairman,\ncommented that the fall was due to shortage of staff, and choosing the same Carn i val twice running, and suggested 'that\nthe ambiguous comments I made at the beginning of the year probably did not help.\nHEW LOOK FOR CARNIVAL\nFive of this year's IC Ents. Committee\nare to take over the running of Carnival next year under the leadership of Jim\nMurray, this year's Ents. Committee chair man. This should ensure a 'new look for Carnival' and if they are as successful as they have been with this year's IC Bats\nCarnival should become a function of interest and enjoyment rather than the trial it was this year,\nBALLS OF FIRE\nRoyal College of Science Union Mascot,\nJezebel, is to carry a flame from the\nsite of the start of the Great Fire of\nLondon in'1666 *o Queenhithe on July15 th, where a number of Balls commemorating the\nfire will be held in aid of the Lady Hoare\nThalidomide Appeal.\nla ul Ward, RCSU Motor Club President said that every effort would be made to\nsee that the request to borrow Jez received on Monday woj tld be complied with, and that J ez, newly refurbished this year/ would carry the flame.\nRCS Motor Club also tell FELIX that ,\nthey have their eye on a pump for J ez. STAFF INTERVENTION IN UNION ..LECTION\nThe IC Annual General Meeting on Ihursday 26th May produced some rare sparks for the time of the year.\nThe prologue came in the form of ale tter read to the assembly by the RCS Union\nTreasurer, Mr. H.J. Pain, who challenged\ncertain facts reported in the previous days\nFelix and directed the meeting over it selection of Deputy President. Dave McBain\na second-year Mechanical Engineer, then\nWent on to beat Ian Williams, ex-Editor of\nFelix, by 262 votes to 101.\nProminent among the representatives on\nnext year's Council elected by the Union\nfloor is David Reich, successful a this third annual attempt. IC Council will be\ngraced by one more woman than usual with the election of Lam Pooock - previously defeated in her bid for the ICWA Presidency,\nThe other floor rep new to Council is Dave\nRayner. Pete Finch, Mike \"Wilson ( Halls Representative this year), and Brendon\nParker (RCC Chairman) - who produced some\nsurprise publicity were returned for a second, session.\nUnion General Awards went to Hugh Dov/ley\n(RCC Treasurer),Eric Thorniley (of the Fiicm\nsociety), B.R. McDonnell (of the Boat Club)\nand Jim Murray (Chairman of Ents.)\nNo report was submitted by the Carnival Committee, those from the Clubs Committee\nwere made bearable only by the rather unorthodox treatment accorded by Keith Guy.\nAdrian Fletcher paid one of the highest\ncompliments of the year to Felix by devoting the majority of his Presidential summing up to a criticism of it. DIW/SID\nROBERTS ELECTED TO GUILDS\nPete Roberts is now the President Elect of Qui Ids. He was voted in at the Guilds Union meeting last week. Phil Marshall will bethe new Vice President and Ian\nG led hill the Secretary.

A resolution was\npassed asking its representatives on ICU Council to demand\nare election for the post of\nDeputy President in view of\nthe way in which an attack on\nIan Williams had been permitted immediately before the\nelection without giving him\na chance to produce a defence .\nCONFLICTING STATEMENTS\nThe meeting got under way\nwith a motion from Mr Duckett\nasking that a full statement\nof finances should be given to\nthe RCSU. He said that at the\nmoment there were two conf li c ting statements running round\nthe College.

In doing his research he had found\nthat the minutes of the particular Committee meeting were a disgrace as they briefed over\nthe whole business and told nothing of what had been said. FINANCIAL EXPLANATION\nMr Pain then gave the meeting a very clear statement on\nthe position of finances. He\nsaid that more bills were\nstill to come in but it looked\nas though there would be about\n\u00a3750 left as stocks at the\nend of the year. ( Fuller det-ails of the finances are given\nelsewhere).

    "content": "3 FELIX\nRCSU TO BREAK EVEN (o on t. from 1.1)\nIn the last two years expenditure has\nbeen running at a higher level than prev i ou sly, apparently because Executive\nPolicies have meant a looser control of\nfinance. As Dave Christopher ( last year's Assistant Secretary) said at the RCSU\nMeeting \"We don't want to account for the\nlast penny\", - talking about the pedal-car -race - and later \"we went out of our\nway to spend our money\".\nIn talking about RCSU finances the\nSenior Treasurer, Mr. Pain, said that he\ndid not think the Union should have re serves, but he warned the meeting that if they went on overspending in this wag?\nthey -would be broke in two or three years.\nIn answer to a question Mrs Pain said that\ntv/o years ago cash reserves stood at \u00a3482\n(of which ,\u00a3300 was scent last year) and tha\nif stocks have to be sold this year it will be the first time whilst he has been\nTreasurer.\nJ. Cavson.\nFREE HOLIDAY ICS 1-EDAL-CAR SUFPORlERo\nThe report on the Pedal Car Race fin ances Yvhich was asked for at the RCSUEGLI\nlast week has now been posted on the not ice boards. This shows that there was a total expenditure on items connected with the pedal car this year of \u00a391, not \u00a3110\nas quoted at the meeting. This is because\none or two items which were originally thought to have been spent on the pedal\ncar were in fact spent on J ez. This \u00a391 may be split up into three\nparts. \u00a39 went onto this yeo.rs account,\nbut was to pay for insurance on a minibus\nwhich was hired, but not used, last year.\nAbout \u00a350 was spent on the team expenses\nand the reconstruction of the car to gain\nmaximum benefits from the new handicap\nrules. A further \u00a332 10s. was spent on\nproviding supporters with a free trip to Bristol. This expenditure was approved\nby President Scott in the bar one night.

UNION MEETING EXTRAORDINARY (cont. from P.l) During the discussion on the pedal cara series of questions was put to Mr. Pain and President Scott. Q. Does RCSU budget for specific expenses?\nPain: Ye3, and it is possible to keep\nexpenditure by clubs within a pretty tight budget.\nQ. Was a warning giv dn to the Union about\nthe high level of expenditure at the\nbeginning of the year?\nPain: Yes, verbally to the committee.\nQ. to Scott: Did you keep this warning in mind when approving items of expenditure-like the pedal car?\nScott (embarrassed): Yes ...\u00bb Vaguely.\nIt then came out that at least \u00a330 of\nthe expenditure on the pedal car was app-proved by Scott in the baj tr on a Saturday\nnight. The motion on the deputy presidential election was then proposed and passed after a little argument.\nA spate of resolutions, counter reso-lu t ions and points of order characterised the meeting from then on. Nobody was stir-pri sed when a motion of no-confidence in the chair( Scott) followed one of Scott's non-rulings but a solution was found and\nthe motion withdrawn.
