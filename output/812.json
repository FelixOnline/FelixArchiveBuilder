The government has\nproblems controlling the riotous\npublic and in order to cater for their\nbloodthirsty tendencies has\nintroduced Free Vee (free\ntelevision). A string of violent game\nshows is the only broadcast made by\nthe Network. Society's fierce nature\nis satisfied.\nBen Richards (Arnold\nSchwarzenegger, Predator, Raw Deal,\nTerminator) enters the scene. Refusal\nto kill unarmed rioters has resulted\nin his imprisonment. He manages\nto escape but is quickly recaptured\nwhen given away by a Network\nemployee he has kidnapped.\nConsequently he becomes the next\ncontestant on one of the most\npopular of the game shows, The\nRunning Man, fighting for his life in\ngladiatorial style combat.\nThe fellow escapees sent in with\nhim and the kidnapped girl provide\nRichards with his only help. The\nobligatory underground movement\ncan only watch and wait. Their fight\nis aimed at bringing down the\nNetwork so putting an end to the\ntelevision violence which the\ngovernment uses as a smoke screen to hide its true actions.\nGood Morning Vietnam\nThere are few places that\nHollywood likes to take us more\nregularly than Vietnam. Having\nshown us all the ins and outs of\nviolence, death, and destruction of\ninnocence all the films take on the\nbland similarity characterised by the\nphrase 'just another war film'. So\nit's nice to see something fresh.\nTouchstone Pictures, the adult\nsubsidiary of Walt Disney Studios,\nhas just released Good Morning\nVietnam starring Robin Williams as\nUS Forces Radio DJ Adrian\nCronouer. And that is really where\nthe story ends. The film serves as\nlittle more than a vehicle for\nWilliams' incredible talent as a comedy actor, as he ad-lib s his way\nthrough the task of boosting morale\n(it's difficult to believe he could have\nfollowed anything other than a ghost of a script). When Williams is\noff screen the film deteriorates\nnot ica bly though it is never bad. A touch of intrigue provided by the\ninvolvement of a VC terrorist and\nhis sister, whom Cronouer is\nromantically entangled with, adds\na little depth to the movie but in the\nend it's still just a stage for Williams.\nSuperb direction, a strong cast of\nfine actors, set to a wonderful\nsoundtrack make this one of the best\nfilms currently showing.\nAndrew Clarke.\nThe villi an of the piece is Dan\nKillian, host of The Running Man,\ncomplete with all the falsity and\narrogance which both typifies the\npresenters of game shows and\npersonifies the faceless beau roc racy of government. He has the\nsmugness of one who knows that\nnobody has ever beaten the system.\nOf course, he's never seen a Schwarzenegger movie.\nWhen a book is transferred to the\nbig screen the result is inferior in\nalmost every case, and The Running\nMan is no exception. The book is\ngood, the film is not. Unusually this\nhas nothing to do with the normal\nloss of detail and depth which\nadaptation imposes. Indeed the\nbook, by Richard Bachman (a.k.a. Stephen King), has little detail,\nhaving been edited down to nothing\nbut story in order to obtain 'the\ngoofy speed of a silent movie'.\nThe film has nothing of Richards'\nwife and child though, or the\nstruggle to expose the government's genocidal pollution policy. The\ngame show is different, its rules are\ndifferent, the arena is different, the\nplayers are all different. Even the\nmajor characters are different. In\nReview It\nWould you like to become part of\nthe FELIX reviews team?\nIf you would like to write about an\nevent you think would be of interest\nto readers of FELIX, or if you want\nto go and see a free film preview or\nwrite a review of a good book you\nhave just read pop into the FELIX\nOffice and find out more!\nshort it's a different story. Not so\nmuch a film based on a book as one\ngiven the same name.\nThe reason the book triumphs\nover the movie is quite simply that\nits story is the better one. It has\ntension and excitement, sadly\nlacking in the film.\nEven with the freedom of a re-write, the chance to s at i rise the\nmainstay of modern mass viewing\nis overlooked. Instead, the only\nclear statement made is the\nnecessity of curbing violence in\nentertainment before society\ndevelops the addiction to it\nportrayed in this and so many other\nfilms. Ironically, this is exactly\nwhere Schwarzenegger has made\nhis acting career.\nUltimately we have a typical\nBOOKS Everything.....\nEverything you always suspected\nwas true about advertising but were\ntoo legal, decent and honest to ask\nby Martyn Forrester, 96 pages,\nFontana (\u00a32.95).\nIf you want a short evening's entertainment you could do worse\nthan borrow a copy of this book, but\nin my opinion, it's not worth buying\nyourself. Bits of this book made me\nlaugh others didn't and ninety-six\npages of variably funny anecdotes\ndon't add up to value for money.\nPart of the trouble is that it tries\ntoo hard to be funny\u2014most clearly\nseen in the Glossary which contains\ngems like 'Adaptation: Someone\nelse's ad modified to fit your brief.\nIt might sound funnier after one of\nthose three-hour working lunches\nhe mentioned.\nA few themes get repetitive after\na while. Those working lunches,\nwomen sleeping their way to the\ntop, women....There is definitely a patronising attitude to women\nwhich I couldn't quite figure out. At\ntimes it seems tongue in cheek, at\nothers it's so understated that its\ndifficult to tell if the author is being\nSchwarzenegger movie. The initial\ninjustice and subsequent deaths of\nseveral friends and included as\njustification for the bloody reprisals\ndoled out in the predictable finale.\nIt all appeals to your base instincts,\nbut it can really do little more.\nIf you happen to be tempted by\nthis form of cinema entertainment\nthen it remains a far more attractive\nprospect than the ridiculous Rambo\nIII. Nevertheless, having found a pin a cle with the brilliant Predator,\nSchwarzenegger has stumbled to a low ebb with what is truely his\nworst film. If you just want to see\nan action movie then wait for Bruce\nWillis in Die Hard, and give this one\na miss.\nAndrew Clarke.\nsubtle or just plain male chau veni st. The funniest sections are generally\nquote's of other advertising people's copy or overheard comments. My\nfavourites include 'To be honest, I believe in putting all our eggs on the\ntable', and 'Advertising is a people's business. So's can i bali sm'. The\nchapter on 'Hiccups, Cockups and\nDid Anyone remember to take out\ninsurance?' is good for a laugh.\nWhere he tells of favourite tricks\nwith words it makes quite good\nreading and after the section on food\nphotography, food ads will never\nlook the same again. How does a photographer rejuvenate a flat fizzy\ndrink? Just add salt. I wonder how\nmany people will try out his little\ntest: 'Simply add a spoonful of salt\nto your mate's lager, then stand well\nback'.\nYou'll find out how people have\ngot into the business, what top\npeople earn and how people get\nsacked ('don't worry we're just\nredecorating your office').\nPS it must be only advertising\nmen who could get high on cocoa\nleaf, what would happen if they\never met coca leaves?\nOctober 7 1988 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nUnion Cards\nDear Bill,\nI have just collected my new Union card, a cardboard and plastic monstrosity that will\nbecome really dog-eared in my pocket. Where\nhave the handy, credit card sized pieces of plastic\ngone? Every friend I have at another College with\nthe large, cardboard type of Union card expressed\nenvy that ours were so practical. Now we have\nsunk to envying other people. I think I will cut\noff the spare card (the telephone numbers are not\nso useful that I want to constantly carry them\naround).\nI also noticed that the colour of the reverse side\nof the card no longer indicates your Hall of\nResidence which I feel is a step backwards.\nWhat will we be given next year? Perhaps a filo fax size card with six ring binder holes\npunched into it, or maybe a huge badge that we\nhave to wear.\nYours,\nClare Crippen, Physics 3.\nFire Hazards\nDear Bill,\nDuring the Summer I stayed in Falmouth\nKeogh, the only time I have lived in an IC Hall.\nOne night, while slightly under the influence,\nsome friends and I decided to investigate the fire\nand safety precautions of the Hall. No! We didn't set off the fire alarms or anything irresponsible,\nwe're all jolly sensible people. We found that on\nmy landing the door from the staircase had no\nhandle and, if shut, would trap everyone. The\nfire door on the Selkirk level, that is supposed\nto be held back by a magnet normally and should\nautomatically spring back shut when there is a fire alarm, has no spring. This means that if a fire\nalarm went off it would stay open instead of\ncutting off the fire. We also found that the door\nto the fire escape could not be opened as\nsomething had buckled the metal frame. I would\nnot live in Southside again. If anyone other than\nstudents were living there, the Hall would have\nbeen closed long ago.\nYours,\nGail Turner.\nSpanner\nCollections\nDear Bill,\nCan I just take this opportunity to remind\nGuilds' Freshers that if they did not receive a copy of Spanner, the City and Guilds Union\nHandbook, at the Rector's Reception then they\ncan collect one from the Guilds Office, situated\non Mechanical Engineering Level 3, at any time.\nI would also like to thank everyone who\ncontributed in any way to the publication,\nespecially all those who helped stuff them into\nthe envelopes.\nYours sincerely,\nAdrian Bourne, Spanner Editor 1988.\nDear Bill,\nI would like to use the pages of your newspaper\n(as bog roll\u2014no, I don't mean that) to\ncongratulate the re designers of the Union Lounge\nfor providing the perfect natural habitat for the\nchair's that live there. The. perfect cam of l age which the red floor provides for their red seats\nseems to be fooling everyone. I myself have\nalready fallen over five of them. Well done! They\nmay even feel so at home that we get some baby\nchairs after.. .after.. .(what is the gestation period\nfor a chair?).\nYours,\nDaffy Dixon, ME2.\nClub Ed\nI am continuing my role as Club's Editor, and I would welcome contributions from any IC Club\nor Society. In order to get articles printed in a Friday's FELIX they must be submitted by 1.30pm on the preceding Monday lunchtime.\nPhotographs are more than welcome to add\ninterest to the article\u2014they may be collected from\nme afterwards.\nAs the Editor of the page I reserve the right to\nedit articles. Usually this is so that all the Club's articles submitted can be printed. If an article is\nvery long then it could become a feature about\nthe activity.\nOnce again I hope to hear from ALL the clubs\nout there.

I trust\nthat future Felices will be produced in your good\nol' inimitable style (crawl, crawl) and not with\nthis scandalous waste of paper and ink.\nLotsa luv,\nMax Kallios, Vice President C& GU.\nEditorial\nCollating Blues. The week before term was a very\nhectic week for FELIX. In addition to a colossal\namount of photocopying for Freshers Week, we\nhad a larger than average FELIX to bring out, and\nonly a skeleton staff to put it together. In previous\nyears FELIX has relied on the support of those\nUnion Officers staying in College over the\nSummer and on the support of the other three\nSabbaticals.\nLast Saturday, however, when we had 4000\ncopies of FELIX to collate and only two members\nof FELIX staff on hand, the Union Officers,\ndecided that they would much rather get drunk\nin the Union bar.\nThe story runs something like this. The Union\ndecided to throw a freebie for the Union Officers\non Saturday Night (the FELIX Editor was not\ninvited). As Deputy President, Chas Brereton,\nneeded to fold his leaflets for the Overseas\nstudents' reception on Sunday, we decided to ask\nthe Union Officers to drop into FELIX after their\nreception, to help collate FELFX and the Overseas\nliterature. Chas wandered into the office about\nmid evening and reported that none of the\nOfficers were interested in collating. In my\nnaivety I approached a couple of the Officers who\nwere busy reading advance copies of FELIX in\nthe Union Bar. One of them explained that he'd much rather get to know the Freshers, the other\nhad to move a table back into the snack bar and\nso would be unavailable.\nWe were left with 4000 copies of FELIX to\ncollate and no one to collate them. There is very\nlittle one can do in this situation; I ended up\nwalking around the Quad five times and praying\nfor something to happen.\nI am therefore grateful to the fresher s in Beit\nHall for pulling together in what must be one of\nthe fastest ever collations for a FELIX of this size.\nWhen the folding machine packed in they even\nmanaged to fold most of the FELLX calendars by\nhand. Nevertheless, for Freshers to have to stay\nup until the early hours of the morning on their\nfirst night at Imperial is not a very satisfactory.\nIt is refreshing to know that some people in this\nUnion are prepared to go out of their way to help\nthe rest of the students. It's more than can be said\nfor your elected Union Officers.\nApologies to Dramsoc for the comment in story\n3 of the editorial on Monday. Dramsoc would like\nto point out that the individuals concerned were\nacting as individuals and not as members of\nDramsoc.\nThe Union Lounge. Since last week we have\nbeen able to confirm the rumour that the firm\nRugglers were able to repaint the Union Lounge\nin time at half the fee that was paid to the\nindividuals in Dramsoc. I am not knocking those\nindividuals; they worked bloody hard and had\nvery little sleep so that the job could be finished\nin time. Why were Rugglers able to do the job\nso cheaply ? There are two schools of thought:\n(1) Rugglers are nice guys (2) They overcharged\nfor the rest of the Snack Bar refurbishment.\nStaff Meeting. Today 1pm. Drop in to\nconstructively criticise\nthis issue.\nPage 2 FELIX October 7 1988\n\n"

Speaking for the motion Mr\nHarbour Bridge said that\ndiscussions of a political nature\nshould be limited to Clubs and\nSocieties. He express ecT concern that\nminority groups could pass motions\nof a political nature by turning out\nen masse at UGM's. Speaking against the motion,\nOverseas Studen Committee\nChairman, Amin El Kholy pointed\nout that the motion ran against the\nprinciples of freedom of speech and\nminority groups could be opposed\nif those in opposition also turned up\nen masse to the U GM. Other\nspeakers suggested that the motion\nwould prevent discussion of issues\nimportant to Overseas Students,\nand questioned who would decide,\nwhether or not motions were\n'relevant'.\nChris Martin commented that the\nmotion would effectively allow the\nGoverning Body of Imperial College\nto dictate what was and what was\nnot discussed at UGM's. The motion was taken to the vote\nand defeated by an overwhelming\nmajority.\nRag Mag\nContinued from front page.\nMr Williams told FELIX that he\nhad asked Mr Baker if anything was\nunacceptable on Sunday afternoon\nand he had said he 'didn't think so'.\nMr Williams expected to be\ncontacted by Mr Baker by Monday\nlunchtime. Mr Baker similarly\nexpected to be contacted by Mr\nWilliams on Monday morning.\nWhen he was not contacted, Mr\nWilliams sent the Rag Mag to the\nprinters on Monday evening.\nMiss Nicholas, Rag Chairman, has\ncomplained about a number of the\njokes in the new Rag Mag. She\nobjects to two items about the Kings\nCross Fire disaster and several\n'jokes' about the blind and disabled.\nMiss Nicholas told FELIX that she\nhad considered sending some of the\nitems to the charities supported by\nthis year's Rag efforts. The charities\ninclude 'Guide dogs for the blind'.\nMr Williams has defended the Rag\nMag saying 'I'm quite positive it's one of the best.' Fie added that he\nhad seen 'at least another two' Rag\nMags this year, carrying items on\nthe Kings Cross disaster. 'Every joke\nin the Rag Mag was told to me by\nIC students,' he said, 'I think it's a reasonable representation of IC\nstudents' sense of humour.'\nThe Rag Committee meeting\ntoday will discuss the Rag Mag and\nthe Censorship Committee will\nmeet next week, to decide the fate\nof the Rag Mag, which may have to\nbe recalled from the printers.\nThe Rag Mag Censorship\nCommittee was formed three years\nago in response to a Rag Mag,\nedited by Mr Tony Spencer. The\nmagazine contained items on the\nBradford Fire Disaster, which\ncaused an uproar in the national\npress.\nIC Radio\ngoes FM\nImperial College Radio has begun\nFM broadcasting trials in Southside,\nmaking it one of only two student\nstations in the country to broadcast\non FM. The station has been granted\na licence to conduct test\ntransmissions on 97.7 MHz by the\nDepartment of Trade and Industry.\nThe station are planning to install\nmore speakers in Evelyn Gardens in\nan effort to expand their network\nand to replace existing speakers\nstolen or removed over the years.\nMarathon\nMan\nCollege security guard, Bob\nDickens, 51, is to run a full 26 mile\nmarathon in Dublin on October 31.\nAfter a year's training he plans to\npay for his flight to Dublin and run\nthe marathon f( jr The Cancer\nResearch Fund. Anybody interested\nin sponsoring Mr Dickens should\ncontact him via college internal 3372.\nNicked!\nChief Security Officer, Geoff\nReeves, has warned students to be\naware of cycle-thieves operating\naround the College. He told FELIX\nthat thieves were succeeding in\ncutting chains and removing\npadlocks securing bicycles. He went\non to point out that more effective\npadlocks are available from the\nSherfield Security Desk.\nChalmed\nI'm sure!\nMr James Chalmers retired from his <\nfull-time post as College Senior\nAssistant Secretary last Friday. Mr\nChalmers will remain at the College\nin a part-time capacity 'to help out\nover the year'. At a function on\nWednesday to honour Mr\nChalmers' retirement, Mr John\nSmith, College Secretary, made a short speech and presented Mr\nChalmers with an Aaron Stones\nlithograph.\nDescribed by Mr Smith as his\n'right hand man', Mr Chalmers\ncame to Imperial College from the\nMalaysian Colonial Service over 25\nyears ago. His past experiences\ninclude work in the British\nIntelligence Services during the war\nin the orient, and work in\ncommerce.\nMr Chalmers said 'I came in full\nof enthusiasm' as he described the\nstart of his career at Imperial, and\nwent on to say that he has 'enjoyed\nit throughout.'\nNew mixer\nfor IC\nradio\nImperial College Radio have been\nawarded \u00a32458 by the Queensgate\ntrust to purchase an ex-demonstration mixing desk. They\nhave been offered the mixer at half\nprice by Mr Alan Archer, an ex-Electrical Engineering student now\nworking for Sandcroft SAC200. The\nnew mixer will allow separate\nprogrammes to be transmitted on\nFM and AM and has the facility for\nmultiple channel recording.

The extra wide (9\ninch) rear tyres spun with a shriek\nwhich lasted half a second, blue tyre\nsmoke drifting out of the wheel\narches, then the tyres gripped. The\ndriver let the car reach 30 mph\nbefore hitting second gear, and the\ncar reached 50 mph in under 7\nseconds from when the lights had\nchanged, at which point the driver\neased off in case there were any\npolice around.\nMeanwhile, at Santa Pod drag\nstrip some serious racing was about\nto take place, as two cars lined up\nfor the top fuel dragster final. The\nlight alloy V8 engines made a noise\nlike gunfire through 16 un silenced exhausts as the drivers (both\nwomen) inched their cars up to the\nstart, line. The bicycle sized front\ntyres touched the line, and a steady\norange light lit up indicating the\nfact. Another light came on and as\nthe three enormous (4 inch\ndiameter) throttles flipped wide\nopen on the top of each engine, the\ngreen light glowed. Both cars leapt\nforward. The extra wide (18 inch)\nlarge diameter, extra soft compound\nracing slick rear tyres on the car,\ndriven by Monica Oberg, spun\neasily with a sound totally drowned\nby the unbelievable blast of noise\nfrom the engines.

Apart from the giant rear,\ntyres and a large air intake on the\nbonnet this car looks standard, but\nas soon as the light went green, it\nbecame pretty obvious that the\nengine was not the Ford Cosworth\nitem (in fact it was a7.2 litre\nChrysler engine). The giveaway\ncame in that not only did the front\nwheels lift clear off the ground, but\none of them lifted about 8 inches\nhigher than the other as a result of\nthe chassis twisting under the\ntremendous power of the engine.\nThe car managed a time of 8.11\nseconds at a terminal speed of 176\n\u00bb ph, which is not only a lot quicker\nH\\ an a standard Sierra by a wide\nmargin, it would also leave a formula one grand prix car standing.\nWell, that about covers half of the\naction.

    "content": "Opinion\npassages from Isaiah. This all\nreaches a climax with the\nappearance of Jesus Christ in\nAmerica after his Resurrection\nappearances in Jerusalem.\nApparently then, Christ chose to\nrecant His words in John 16.10:\n'...because I go to the Father and\nyou will see me no more...,' and to\ndisprove Mark's words in MK 16.19;\n'...the Lord Jesus after He had\nspoken to them, was taken up into\nheaven, and sat down at the right\nhand of God.' Rather, He went to\nAmerica and preached over there.\nThe more improbable the history,\nthe more attractive it seems to be.\nFor example, the Jews were\napparently transported to the\nAmericas in pre-Christian, dish-shaped submarines, which had the\nfacility of plugged air holes, to be\nunstopped upon surfacing, and\nwhich were lit inside by magically\nglowing stones. Miraculously the\nvessels reached the other side of the\nAtlantic all together and intact, with\nthe task of establishing a community\nthen being taken in hand. One\nproblem with the history, although\ncarefully mapped out to avoid\ninconsistencies, is the glaring\npresence of anachronisms, such as\nthe 'compass' (not invented until\nthe twelfth century AD) and the\nrather too familiar references to the\n'horse' (which was not introduced\nto America until the Europeans\narrived).\nActually the history is the least\nsignificant pointer to the Book's validity, for the prophesies and\ndoctrinal assertions are far more\nif lumina ting in this respect. Without\nbeing too detailed, it is worthy to\nnotice that the Book's prophesies\nregarding Jesus Christ far outstrip\nthe accuracy of the Old Testament;\nand despite the Mormons' holding\nthem to be evidence of the Book's divine origin, it is easier to see this\nrather as prophesy in retrospect. For\nexample, Jesus' mother has her\nname prophesied, 'Mary' and her\nconnubial state 'Virgin'. Neither is\nprophesied in the Old Testament,\nfor although Isaiah 7.14 does for see The most offensive\nfact about\nMormonism is its\ntotal into le rence for\nanyone else\nChrist's birth hundreds of years\nbefore the event, the Hebrew may\nperhaps better be translated a 'young woman'..('Behold, a 'young\nwoman' shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name\nImmanual (God is with us).) That.\nmost Christians believe in Mary's virginity before Christ's birth is not\nthe issue, since what is being shown\nas over-accurate prophesy and a distinct obsession with making\ncertain doctrinal points too\nabundantly clear\u2014which leads to\nthe next consideration.\nIn light of Smith's disgust at the\nChurch for its wars over doctrinal\nissues, would it not seem only took\nlikely that 'he' should pack the Book\nof Mormon with clear\ncommandments which once and for\nall settle all the arguments? Indeed\nwe find just this. When viewed in\nthis manner, the whole book\nbecomes transparent in a flash, for\nit is certain that whole chapters have\nbeen constructed for the sole\npurpose of making one or two\nassertions, embellished heavily of\ncourse with quasi-historical\npadding. Examples include the\narguments over the existence of hell\nand the state of the soul at death,\nand whereas the Adventist's were\narguing that Scripture may be\ninterpreted as disclosing the fact of\n'soul-extinction' at death and\n'annihilation' of the wicked as\nopposed to everlasting torment, the\nBook of Mormon improves on\nGod's Biblical revelation by bluntly\naffirming eternal torment and the\ntransitional life of the soul between\ndeath and resurrection. I am not\nThe doctrines run\ninto clear heresies\nendeavour ing to favour either view\nhere, but simply illustrating my\npoint. Another important one (yet\nironical in view of later teaching by\nSmith) is Christ's deity. It is\nsignificant to understand that\nalthough His deity is clearly taught\nin the Bible, it is never stated bluntly\nin a way completely immune to\nmisinterpretation. But again the\nissue is not here, but the fact of\nSmith's 'clarifications'. Christ is\nfrequently and directly called God,\nin a way that permits of no personal\ndiscovery, and which rather\nobscures the beauty of the Trinity.\nAnd now their weakest area\u2014\nJospeh Smith himself. Regarding\nthe above, 'Smith's' divinely\ninfallible translation of the Book of\nMormon clearly affirms the doctrine\nof the Trinity (again far more\nclinically than the Bible), and yet\nSmith is documented as having\npreached on the 'plurality of gods',\nin utter contradiction to the\nTrinitarian position, and today you\nwill find that the Trinity is not\nfashionable for the contemporary\nMormon, for he has been informed\nby Smith since the translation of the\ninfallible Book, that he, and every\nother faithful Mormon, shall reach\nThe Mormons\nclearly state that all\nother Christians are\nof the Devil\nequality with God the Father at\nsome future date, and then proceed\nto govern his own universe in much\nthe same way as our God (once\nhuman like us) governs the present\none. This sort of contradiction is far\nfrom unique, and I feel it casts\nfurther doubt on Smith's authorship\nof the Book, which is the subject of\nthe final paragraph. Also Smith's character is somewhat in doubt.\nApparently, he at one point eloped\nwith a young lady since her father\nwould not countenance their\nmarriage, for the reason that he\nknew Smith to have spent much\ntime engaged in searching for\nhidden treasure with the aid of\nmagic 'peep stones'. Although the\nobservation will seem immaterial to\nthe 'materialists', it is worth noting\nthat the practice of divination is\nexpressly forbidden in the Bible, and\nthat this occupation hardly lends\nweight to the Mormon's evaluation\nof Smith as a seeker after Truth. As\nis the case with the Jehova's Witnesses with regard to the\ndoubtful character of their founder\nCharles Taze Russell (prosecuted for\nselling 'miracle wheat' at exorbitant\nprices, amongst other things), the\nMormon's are not keen on\ndiscussion of Smith's character, and\nseem to know little about him. Any\naccusation against him is, of course,\nimmediately assumed to have been\nfabricated and to be Satanically\ninspired\u2014which brings me to their\nview of the Church.\nPerhaps the most offensive fact\nabout Mormonism, is its total\nintolerance for anyone else at all. So\nmuch for Christ's prayer for the\nunity of His Church in John 17\u2014the\nMormons clearly state that all other\nChristians are of the Devil. Again\nthis is fundamentally an assertion,\nfor looking at the general doctrinal\nteaching of the Book of Mormon\n(supposedly the basis of belief).\nThere seems to be little difference\nbetween them and evangelists. So\nwhat is the problem? It is the pure\nassertion that the Mormon Church\nis, without good reason, the Only\nChurch and so has unique authority\nto disciple Christians. Then of\ncourse with the extra teaching, the\ndoctrines run into clear heresies and\none is left with non-Christian\nOrganisations with great power\nover its members, built on the\nfoundation of a manifestly spurious\nBook, which seems Christian. The\nMormon danger is in shifting\nSalvation through Christ onto the\nOrganisation. (From a Christian\nperspective, it might well be\ninjudicious to suppose that all\nMormons are necessarily not\nChristian, for it is surely conceivable\nthat some of them do know Christ,\ndespite the clear fact that\nmembership of the Organisation is\nnot conducive to encouraging this\nrelationship.)\nAnd finally, Smith did not write\nthe Book. The Mormons claim that\nhe translated it in a few days, and\nthat this time constraint and his\nsemi-illiterate state verify the\nmiraculous nature of the events.\nAgain this is odd logic. As yoU will\nremember, Smith had four years of\nrelative inactivity in which to write\nit (or copy it) in his own handwriting\n(had that been necessary), and\nalthough theories suggesting Smith\nto have possessed a dual personality\n(one side dull\u2014the other containing\nhidden brilliance) have been\nforthcoming, surely the obvious\nsolution points to his having either\nThe Jews were\napparently\ntransported to the\nAmericas in .pre-Christian dish\nshaped submarines\npersuaded someone to write the\nbook for him, or to his having been\nused by someone else as an unlikely\nprophet to astound the credulous.\nWhatever, as mentioned previously,\nSmith's subsequent teachings are by\nno means always consistent with\nthe very carefully defined doctrinal\nassertions of the Book, and so his\ni authorship is probably out of the\nquestion. And these later teachings,\nit must be recalled are in no way less\nauthoritative than the Book, even\nthough they conflict heavily at\ntimes, making the whole\nI Organisation a house built on sand.\nOctober 7 1988 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nReprinted from FELIX issue 808. Feedback on this article is welcome.\nGod Chose America\nJulian Butcher casts a critical eye over the\nfaith and beliefs of the Mormon church..\nI think we are all aware of the presence of the Mormon Church with its\nimpressive gold steeple immediately opposite the Mechanical Engineering\nbuilding, but it is surely less certain in most people's minds as to who\nthey are or what they believe. Often they are regarded with some caution,\nbeing seen as not quite on a par with evangelical Christians, indeed rather\nmore readily being equated with the Jehova's Witnesses due to their\nmutual door-knocking activities. For many they seem to be just another\ndenomination, after all their name seems quite inoffensive\u2014'The Church\nof Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints', and of course, the Mormon choirs\nare reasonably famous and respected throughout the western world.\nPerhaps the only well-known peculiarity about them is their history of\npolygamy, which found its way into the faith under Brigham Young, but\nwhich is no longer encouraged. My intention is to show that Mormonism\nis full of peculiarities, that it is not Christian and that its foundation is\none of blind faith.\nA short history runs something\nlike this: In the early part of the last\ncentury a young American lad, who\nwas a 'keen seeker after Truth',\nfound himself totally exasperated by\nthe disunity in the Church. He was\nparticularly averse to the doctrinal\nnit-picking and apparent impotence\nof the Church with regard to\nspiritual gifts from God\u2014(eg\nprophesy, healing, etc). The lad's name was Joseph Smith, and\ndespite his having received a poor\neducation, he was chosen and\nenabled by God to perform a great j task. This task was declared to him|\nby an angel, who appeared to Smithj\nwhilst in prayer, and who informed!\nSmith was\nmiraculously able to\ntranslate 'Reformed\nEgyptian' into\nEnglish\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2022 II M Ham him of an ancient set of gold and\nbrass plates, which contained many\n'precious' things that had been\nomitted from the Bible, and which\nhe was then required to translate\ninto English. For four years, on the\nsame date each year, the angel took\nhim to the hill in which the plates\nwere buried, but not until the fourth\nyear was Smith allowed to view the\nwriting. Eventually however, the\nbox was opened (with the use of a lever) and the plates revealed,\ntogether with a pair of divine\nspectacles the Urim and Thummim)\nwith which Smith was miraculously1 able to translate the 'Reformed\nEgyptian' spontaneously into\nEnglish. This he claimed to have\ndone, and the 'Three Witnesses',\nDavid Whitmer, Martin Harris and\n...Mormonism is full\nof peculiarities...\nOliver Cowdry testify to this.\n(Martin Harris was the financier for\nthe first publication). (Interestingly,\nthe Mormons claimed to have\nconsulted a respected authority on\nhieroglyphics with regard to the\n'Reformed Egyptian', who is said to\nhave recognised the characters and\npraised the text for its unique\nquality. In a later letter however, he\ndenies this vehemently.)\nThe result of all this was the Book\nof Mormon\u2014Another Testimony of\nJesus Christ, which was claimed by\nSmith to have equal (if not superior)\nauthority with the Bible. After all,\nif God had miraculously generated\nperfect translation through the Urim\nand Thummim, the Book of\nMormom must be devoid of all\nerrors and other translation\nproblems, (such as idiomatic\nvariations and changed emphases\netc). Indeed he accepted the Bible's authority only insofar 'as it was\ntranslated correctly', which\n(although seemingly innocuous)\nactually exposes the Bible Scripture\nto be subject to any and every whim\nof Joseph Smith. Granted it is no\nlonger generally used, but Joseph\nSmith's version of the Bible includes\nextra passages 'clarifying' certain\ndoctrinal position, which have no\nbasis in early manuscripts\nwhatsoever. The Book of Genesis\nfor example includes completely\nThe Mormon Church in Exhibition Road\nnew passages concerning the\nrebellion of Satan, which Smith has\ninserted with impunity; since the\nBook of Mormon explicitly states\nthat the Mormon Church leadership\nenjoys the privilege of direct\nrevelation from God, the authority\nof which is comparable to that of\nScripture, if not superior to it.\n(Hence polygamy under Brigham\nYoung, when both the Bible and the\nBook of Mormon blatantly condemn\nthe practice). This fact of 'divinely'\ninspired leadership (with apparently\nlittle constraint) is clearly the most\ndisturbing aspect of Mormonism, its\nfoundation is shaky and open to\nabuse; especially in light of the fact\nthat for the Mormon, God can be\nseen flatly to contradict Himself in\nScripture and revelation.\nThe Book of Mormon claims to be\na set of historical writings, handed\ndown from generations of Jews who\nhad travelled from the Middle East\nto settle in America around 600BC. Most of the pages are preoccupied\nwith boring pseudo-histories of\nwars, factions and prophesies (and\nof course genealogies).

The move comes in the wake of complaints from students that damage by previous occupants has\nnot been taken into account. Senior Assistant Finance Officer, Mr Malcolm Aldridge, told FELIX that students\nwho feel they have been unfairly assessed for damage charges last year in Lexham Gardens should write to\nhim or speak to Mr David Parry in the cash office on level four of the Sherfield Building.\nlex ham Gardens, where Managing Surveyor Peter Hallworth and Senior Assistant\nFinance Officer Malcolm Aldridge were caught with their trousers round their ankles.\nThe unusually high damage\ncharges were made after the College\nwas forced to return the Lexham\nGardens Head Tenancy flats to their\nlandlord, Mr Dangor, last year. Mr\nPeter Hallworth, Managing\nSurveyor (Residences) and Mr\nDines, Assistant Clerk of Works,\nnegotiated an overall charge of\n\u00a38362 with Mr Dangor, for the\ndamage to the flats returned to him.\nThe College has attempted to\nrecoup \u00a33345 from student deposits\nas damage charges.\nMr Aaron Kotcheff, Ex-Student\nManager of flats 25 and 54, told\nFELIX that students were being\ncharged for damage done in\nprevious years. He claims that the\nCollege have not consulted the\ndamage reports given to him by\nstudents as they moved in at the\nbeginning of last year. Mr\nHallworth, who is responsible for\nassessing damage charges for\nstudents in Head Tenancies, told\nFELIX that he had not recieved the\nreports from Mr Kotcheff. Mr\nKotcheff said that he had not been\nasked for the reports until students\nstarted to complain. Mr Hallworth\nclaims that the reports should have\nbeen sent to him as a matter of\ncourse.\nThe remaining \u00a35000 of the\npayment made to Mr Dangor is to\nbe met by the College Residences\naccount. Mr Aldridge explained that\nthe College is unable to charge the\namount to any other account due to\nrestrictions from the University\nGrants Committee (UGC). The\nfurther burden to the Residences\naccount will put further pressure\nupon the College to increase rents\nin Halls and Houses again next year.\nThe Head Tenancies are budget ted as separate units, which should not\nplace a burden upon the residence\nfinances.\nThe cost of the damages comes\nafter a \u00a321000 deficit from the Head\nTenancies the year before.

I visited the\nGlenfiddich Distillery in Dufftown,\nwhich has been owned and\nmanaged by the Grant family since\n1887; the final product then was so\ngood that the process has remained\nlargely unchanged since, for fear of\nmaking it worse. The traditional\nprocess is reflected in the price-about \u00a313 a bottle, but nevertheless\nthey sell as much as they can\nproduce.\nThe first process is in the Mash\nHouse where the two essential\ningredients are mixed together-malted barley, ground to a powder\ncalled grist is mixed with Highland\nspring water. When heated, the\nwater dissolves the sugars out of the\ngrist producing a sugary liquid\ncalled wort. This is then passed to\nthe Tun Room where yeast is added\nand the liquid fermented to produce\na wash which resembles a beer.\nThis wash is then passed to the\nStillhouse. Glenfiddich is distilled\ntwice in traditionally shaped copper\nstills which are built and maintained\nby their own copper smiths. The\nstills are unusually small, but\ndespite increased demand, they\nrefuse to change the size or shape.\nThe distillation is controlled by the\nstillman who selects the fine 'middle\ncut' for maturation; the rest is\nrecycled. The process from the\nStillroom onwards is under strict\ncontrol of the Customs and Excise\npeople; the spirit side is completely\nsealed.\nAt this stage the spirit is\npractically colourless and tasteless,\nand cannot legally be called whisky\nuntil it has matured for at least three\nyears. Glenfiddich is matured for at\nleast eight years. Maturation takes\nplace in oak casks; unlike wines,\nonce whisky is bottled it changes\nvery little. Some whisky is matured\nin new oak casks, some in old casks,\nand some in casks from Spain which\nhave been used previously for\nsherry. These three are mixed\naccording to an exact formula to\nobtain the required taste and colour\nof the final product. The maturation\ntakes place in the bonded\nwarehouses, which have two locks,\none key held at the Distillery and the\nother by Customs. This is to avoid\nhaving to pay duty until the whisky\nis ready for sale; with 55 million\nlitres in the warehouses this would\notherwise mean an enormous\namount of money tied up.\nDuring the maturation, some 10%\nof the original volume is lost, and\nthis figure increases if the\nmaturation is longer. The matured\nwhisky, however, is far stronger\nthan necessary, and is therefore\ndiluted with the right amount of\nspring water to give either 40%\nalcohol for the UK or 43% for export\n(Yes, 'Duty Free' whisky is stronger\nthan the full price variety). This is\nthen passed to the bottling plant\nwhere the 75cl size bottles are filled\nby automated machine. Other sizes\nare done 'by hand', but all under\nthe watchful eye of HM Customs!\nThe final part of the visit was a sample of the product, which lived\nup to its reputation and did justice\nto the care put into its manufacture.\nWine Fingerprints\nScientists at the French company\nEurofins, based in Nantes, have\ndeveloped a method of taking a distinctive 'fingerprint' of a wine, to\npinpoint its vintage and vineyard\nwith the accuracy of a connoisseur.\nThey use a technique known as\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\nwhich measures the wine's composition in terms of isotopes of\nfour elements, hydrogen, oxygen,\ncarbon and nitrogen. The different\nratios of these elements stamp each\nwine with a unique isotopic\nfingerprint. Eurofins have built up\na data bank of known samples\nwhich allows wines to be instantly\nidentified.\nFrom a small sample the NMR\nmethod can be used to check\nwhether a wine has been diluted or\nadulterated; the method was\ninitially used to detect the practice\nof adding sugar to the grape 'must'\nduring fermentation, enabling the\nscientists to show that the majority\nof beaujolais wines had too much\nsugar added. The method has been\nendorsed as the official EEC method\nof checking wine quality.\nHelp!!\nThanks to Doug King, Penny, Kamala Sen, Steve Meyfroidt, Dave Smedley, Andrew\nWaller, Andrea (sorry I 've forgotten your last name), Michael Dalton, Andy Clarke,\nChris Leahy, Noel Curry, Mylan, Dave Griffiths for last week's Captain Complex,\nYousef Samrout, Summit, Martin Cole, Sarah Conyers, Adam, Dean and Rose.

    "content": "Music\nHymn From A Village\nMarquee, Fruit Bats, The Bible\nThey have done two things at the\nnew Marquee Qub; firstly it creates\nthe impression of being almost as\nsmall as the previous venue (wide\nangle lenses required to avoid\nannoying columns) and secondly\nthey have managed to convert a cinema into something which looks\nexactly like a converted cinema. The\ntwo groups tonight were not helped\nby a terrible sound set up either.\nI arrived just into the set of the\nFruit Bats to discover a Janice Long\nclone singing lead (minus baby).\nShe didn't quite have the hang of\nthe between song quips but at least\nher relatives were there to cheer her\non. Her obtrusive manner detracted\nfrom the actual music. The music\nwas quite punchy in parts with a bass that occasionally came through\nand made you ask the person next\nto you '...what's this one?'. The\nsongs we were supposed to know\n('...and I think you all know this\none, let's go!' etc.) were dull with\nan indie-jangle lilt. They conned an .\nencore by pretending to forget\nwhich was their last song. Obscurity\nor bust.\nThe Bible are strictly New\nTestament, the same vague story\nrepeated four times with some\ninteresting parts tacked onto the\nend. This five man band do a good'\nimpression of American mid-west\nsoft rock all rolled up in a Britishindie package. You get the feeling\nthey are not inspired by anything\nbut simply know how to right\nsongs, and it is only inspiration that\nbreeds originality. To be fair they\ngot a deservedly good reception\nfrom a crowd obviously more\nfamiliar than I am with their music.\nThere were no gems here only the\nsemi-precious such as King Chicago,\nwhich benefitted from the\nintroduction of a saxophone,\nCigarette Girls and something with\nShake in the title.\nThe gig seemed to drift along\nformlessly with a slight uplift at^he\nend of The Bible. Personally I'd prefer to stay at home and read the\noriginal.\nJames-Strip Mine\nSometimes I think James have only\none song. I put on this album and\nthe round, regular drum beat draws\n_my attention, then the jan gly unobtrusive guitar entices me into\nthe tune to be comforted by the\nsmooth bass. As soon as I'm comfortable in the tune Tim Booth's clear, staccato vocals start to play\nwith my mind. The tracks, although\ndifferent in beat and tone, are\nunmistakably James and the more I listen, the more in discern able they\nbecome.\nI am reminded of their previous\nalu bim Stutter which poses sed the\nsame qualities, the same lilt. Is this\nstill the same song?\nThen I realise that .ty it h James all\nis understatement, persuasion\nrather than force, they invite you to\nlisten and if works. A few tracks\nstand out from the already excellent\nfield such as Not There which is\ntouching when you realise what it\nis about, the initial What For and the\nfinal musical Refrain which is the\nepitome of James.\nThe same song, maybe but still a good one.v. Robert Palmer-Hammersmith\nOdeon\nPalmer is an artist, and acts\naccordingly. Not for him the\nex huber ance of a Rock Star, using\nthe crowd to boost his ego. He did\nnot leap ene rgen tic ally around the\nstage thur sting his pelvis at us but\nstrolled to the front seemingly\noblivious of the music to which he\nwas introduced. He was dressed not\nin a gold lame \"suit or leather\ntrousers but a sober grey suit, very\nunderstated and probably very\nexpensive.\nHeretq,sing, his silky growl suits\nall of his eclectic styles from the hard\nrock of \u00a7ome Like it Hot and\nHyperactive To the cocktail bar\nambience of Riptide and Dreams.\nMuch of his current album Heavy\nNova was showcased, interspersed\nwith the best of the rest; Johnny &\nMary, Searching For Clues, Doctor\nDoctor and more. He spoke to us\nonly to introduce the band, all\nseasoned musicians who knew their\nplace, behind him, and the backing\nsinger who ob' us ly knew how to\nkick ass, and cud so when Palmer\nretired to remove his jacket.\nThis was not a show to get carried\naway at and it was a shame to see\nthe Odeon staff preventing people\nfrom dancing. The show was good,\ndespite the lack of an encore which\nseemed unplanned as it took a while\nfor the lights to come up. Perhaps\nhe had started to sweat? After all it\nmust have been hot out here and the\nman is an artist and not a pop star!\nSingles-1.10.88\nJulia Fordham is a 'Woman of the\nEighties' or at least her current\nsingle is but it does not show off the\ntalent her record company obviously\nthinks she has. She preaches\nuncomplicated independence to a light funky beat, and whilst the\nsound is clean it is essentially\nforgettable despite the four\nproducers who worked on it.\nA similar lush production is\nevident on Helleluiah Man by Love &\nMoney. I don't for see massive\nradio play or succes for this offering\nbut if they can perform as well as\nthis live then they would be well\nworth checking out.\nThe Lilac Time are the new band\nof Stephen 'Tintin' Duffy.\nUnfortunately the rustic pop of\nYou 've Got to Love is unlikely to make\nthem a million but it is quite the\nmost attractive single I 've heard in\nages. This record is folk music of the\neighties (and for the nineties) and I love the wit that inspired the\nMajvern Mix on the 12*.\nThe Go-Betweens-Mean Fiddler\nMaybe it's the lighting, maybe it's the atmosphere or perhaps it is just\nme but whenever I go to the\nHarlesden Mean Fiddler I think I recognise people. The place is\nteeming with people I know when\nseen out of the comer of my eye but\nwho metamorphose into someone\nelse when I turn and look.\nDistracting. The venerable Mean\nFiddler has been extended to\ninclude two more bars making a total of four in the small main\nvenue; overkill or shrewd move?\nTo pay \u00a36 for a main band with no\nsupport is excessive however good\nthey are supposed to be. You start \u2022\n'to wonder where the money went,\nit certainly didn't go on improving\nthe Fiddler's PA system which\nsounds like an earthquake at the\nfront. Move back and you can find\na reasonable compromise.\nThe Go-Betweens came on at\n10.45pm after a suitably long wait\nwatching roadie s bring out IV2\nguitars per hour, (why are they so\nslow?). The GBs are a curious\nlooking group. There are two\nguitarist/lead singers; one looks like\nBob Hoskins the other is tall,\ns craggy and stoney faced. The\nbassist is an odd lizard-man but\nlikeable. There is an innocent, coy\ncountry gal on violin and a drummer hidden by her drums.\nThey played a fairly long set\nwhich consisted mostly of songs\nabout , towns in northern\nQueensland where they used to live\n(one each per sum ably), and friends\nof theirs: Clarke Sisters, Karen (I suppose there is little else to write\nabout in Australia). They did not\ncome across well musically; the\nsinging (especially Bob's) was\nfrequently out of (or void of) tune.\nGuitar was scratchy when it should\nhave been full and the whole sound\ndid not carry. The otherwise\nexcellent Streets of my Town was\nspoiled by the amateur sound.\nThe gig was en jpy able though,\nperhaps it was the vaguely chaotic\n'garage' sound and the quirky\ncharacter of the band because it\nwasn't the music, on this occasion.\nThe last encore, Karen was ruined\nfor me by the two people in from j cf me. They pushed in then said\nis better' and proceeded to dal\nlike epileptic dough hooks.
