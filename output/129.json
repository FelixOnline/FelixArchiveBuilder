    "content": "FELIX PHOENIX CONTROVERSY ONE ANSWER\nVIEWPOINT\nRecent opinions, expressed both\nverbally and in print, suggest that the\ncontents of the last Phoenix were neither\nrepresentative of the Union nor in the\nUnion's literary taste. It is, however acknowledged that the present\nEditor has raised the standard of the\nmagazine technically . The presentation is excellent: advertisements\nhave been won. We have gained on\nthe roundabout but lost on the swing3. It appears that the present Editor\n- not to mention some of his Editorial Board - have been allowed to publish\nwhat i3, to \"old-fashioned\" people\nlike myself, remarks or articles which\nare in bad taste. Unfortunately, and\nperhaps leading to the down fall of\nthis \"enlightened\" age, bad taste is nowadays all too often masqueraded as\n\"independent opinion11, \"progressive\nthought\" or some other such \"cultural\"\nplatitude. Offensive remarks contained\nin the last Phoenix, whilst boosting the\nego of a group of literary pimps, have\nembarrassed the Union, It is a pity that many Union members do not yet realise\nthis. Yet they elect the Board of\nDirectors of Phoenix. They have elect-ed, as officers of some other category,\npersons who, as ex1 officio member of the\nBoard of Directors, presumably think\nthat \" it is a good thing to have some\ncontroversy for a change\". This is not\nbroad mindedness it is a combination of\ntactlessness, foolishness and\nabysmal ignorance of elementary\njournalism. So much for the Board's choice of Editor.\nNow the Editorial Board, poor\ninnocent sheep, have be jn able to get\nthemselves into a position of apparent\nin disp ers ability whilst complaining of\nthe oppressive and dictatorial tactics\nof their Editor, They have managed to\ncreate the impression that they are the\nonly people in the Union who are capable\n#f writing articles for the magazine.\nSome brave soul suggests that Nr.\nIrving be flung back into the proverb i al gutter ( like his motor car), and\nimmediately the Editorial Board start\na complicated process of king-making\namongst themselves.\nReaders of Felix who are members\nof the Union should, in any opinion,\nrequest the complete removal of this\noffensive Editorial Board. The many\nwho are capable of writing for Phoenix\nor helping to produce it, should make\nthemselves known. Phoenix has burnt\nso brightly that it is almost in ashes\nagain. The bird must be re-born an\nImperial College Union bird j John Bramley.\nSince Mr, Irving is unable to reply\nto this 'Viewpoint' himself, I feel that\nI must do so. First, I would like to\nthank Mr. Bramley for his compliments\non our handling of the technical and\nadvertising sides of the magazine.\nHad these improvements in advertising\nand sales not been made, Phoenix would\nno longer exist.\nAs all the copy of Phoenix is ino\nspec ted by the Board of Directors before\npublication and sino e they have the\npower to remove the Editor and his Board,\npresumably they are amon p; \"the members of\nthe Union who have not realised that\noffensive remarks in Phoenix have embarrassed the Union,\" Mr, Bramley does\nnot state who they are; they are in fact the President and Secretary of I.C. Union, the three constituent college\nPresidents, the President of I. C.W. A. and the Chairmen of the Social and\nAthletics Clubs Committees. Let\nthem not however despair their belief that controversy can do a pa^er good -combination of tactlessness, foolish ness and ignorance of elementary jour.\u2014,\nnal is m though it may be - is shared by\nmost editors from the New Statesman and\nThe Spectator down to Felice and Phoenix.\nWith regard to the Editorial Board, if he had said that they had managed to\ncreate the impression that they were\nthe only people willing to write far Phoenix he would have been fairer.\nAs far the charge of king-making ( in which, of course, Elder S' cst es man Bramley played no part) I would be\ninterested to know fro irt where Mr.\nBramley obtains his information. In\nfact the point worrying the Board was\nthat if Mr. Irving were forced to\nresign as then seemed likely, none of\nthem were prepared to take on the job\nof Editor and with Mr. Bramley soon\nleaving the College there seemed no\noutsider at all prepared or suitable\nfor the job. Mr. Bramley ends his little article with the battle cry\n'Sack the Editorial Board and find a new one1; for the sake of Phoenix I beg him to change this to 'Find a new\nEditorial Boa\u00b1d and then sack the old\none.'\nMichael Banks.\nTHOUGHT\nIf all the people who have\nspent so much time writing to Felix about the small number of Phoenix contributors had instead spent that time\nwriting articles for Phoenix, there\nwould be nothing for them to write to\nFelix about.\nIf you think that \"Phoenix\" is a mystery - what about this?C) The first correct answer given to Paul\nPorgeas today, before 111\n: wins\na pint. Associates of Felix not eligible.\nAND ANOTHER\nI feel th&t certain of the statements made with reference to, and\ncriticisms levelled at, Phoenix inyo ir last issue should not go unanswered.\nFirst I must thank Mr. Clark for his concern over my Social Page; may\nI take this opportunity of assuring\nhim that a Social Page will appear in the next issue.\nMr. Clark u tates that \"no attempt\nhas been made to collect or encourage\nliterary material from students of the\nCollege\". Here he makes evident his complete ignorance of the true state of\naffairs. I myself could bring forward\na large number of people whom I have\nasked to make a contribution to Phoenix,\nand the majority of the Editorial board\ncould do the same.\nMr. Clark is only the latest in a long line of people who over the years\nhave complained of 'a lack of writers for Phoenix. I may state that the Editori al Board is fully aware that there are\nnot enough t people in the College willing to write. Mr. Clark might do more good\nif he were to attack those who, though\nable to write, are unwilling, rather\nthan the Editor and his Board who are trying\ntheir hardest to produce a balanced magazine from a short supply of material.\nI would respectfully agree with\nboth Mr. Fotter and Mr. Clark that some\nof the articles in the last issue were\nin extremely bad taste and out of place\nin Phoenix. This was pointed out to\nthe Editor by certain members of the\nEditorial Board, He, however, chose\nto trust his own judgement, as he is entitled to do.\nMr. Irving himself states that \"we\nhave not touched the Union subsidy since\nthe present editorial team took over\".\nWhilst this is strictly true I feel it should be pointed out that at the time\nof writing the above statement Mr.\nIrving had not received the bill for the\nlast two issues. This bill has now\nbeen presented and s hews a considerable\nloss on these issues. This of course\nmeans that the mailing of 30\u00b0 copies\nof Phoenix to public schools will not\nbe sub sidi sed out of profits, but that,\nsince we are already committed to it( owing to this information being passed\non to advertisers), the cost will have\nto be carried by the next two issues of\nthe Phoenix.\nYours faithfully, IAN D. HILL\nWUS. CARNIVAL\nOn Saturday May 9th1959 World\nUniversity Service are again holding\ntheir annual Carnival and Garden Pete\nin the grounds of Bedford College.\nIn the past there has always been a strong cont in ent from I.C. and we are\nagain looking for volunteers to help\nrun side-shows, stalls and various\nitems of entertainment.

    "content": "6\nFELIX SIG RIDES AGAIN\nSome of you wi^J. have noticed that,\nin the last issue, I was noticeable\nby my absence - this was due to the\nEditor (curse him!) who has been\ndescribed as the man to \"clean up\nFelix\". Those of you who are aqua im* ted with the character in question will\nknow the futility of this paradox.\nHowever, there has been such an outcry against the suppression of my \u2022alums\nthat he has been forced to allow mm xo\nwrite again, with conditions, however;\nfrom now on all my work mu3t be e lev at ing. To oom ply with this I am writing\nthis column in the Union lift it seems crazy, but who am I? For ay first elevating lecture,\npatients, I am about to hold forth on\n\"The Origins of Culture\".\nCulture begins with the Greeks,\nof course - a most fortunate coincidence for, since they are very old,\nculture has been around some time.\nAs we are taught in this College, anything old is worth keeping, e.g., cheese, wine, the Prof., and so forth.\nDespite this, it is unfortunate that the\nGreeks appeared early in the history of\nspelling and they made so many mistakes.\nA fixation on the letter \"p\" has led to\nmany confusing and p silly mistakes;\nscientists welcome this, of o our se, as\nit makes their work unintelligible when\nused properly. This is a very pst u lp idp notion, in my opinion.\nThe most important invention of\nthe Greeks was the word. When other\ncivilisations eventually found out the\nvirtues of Ancient Greece - how it made\ntheir lamps burn brighter, and so on,\nthey not i oed that whatever the situ a tion-\"The Greeks had a word for it\". It was soon found that this word was of\nuniversal application, in fact the only\ndrawback was its un print ability. The\nword o an be obtained, written or spoken,\nby application to the Felix OfficeI.C.W. A. not included. A modern\nversion of the word is of o our se, the\nmessage, which it seems Private Presley\nhas got.\nAnother famous, and well-used\nGreek invention is the following Joke:\"What' s a Grecian Um?\"\n\"About 30 drachmae a week.\"\nSWOTTING\nby Ann'4Jar gret Radford\nThrough these notes forever wading,\nHow my memory is fading!\nDid I really write so much\nMost of it seems Double Dutoh!\nHer* is something I remember\nWe did it sometime in November.\nThis I'm sure I didn't write\nHere it's surely \"length\" not \"height\".\nIs it really worth this worry?\n(Don't answer that - just learn - and\nhurry!)\nFor these exams Just must be passed,\n(Pray that the next lot are the last),\nIf in the end you want to be\nA.R.C.S. and B. Sc\nIt was this that caused Arry\nStephanas to use that word.\nA very sporting nation, the Greeks\nspent much of their time playing marbles\n- a set of these, the Elgin Marbles,\nsaid to have been used by Socrates,\ncan be seen in the British Museum.\nThese famous marble games were started\non Friday, B.C.1230, when Olympia was\nopened for the first Olympic Games.\nWe are indeed fortunate to have this\nexample of classical architecture near\ncur College. May I hope that you view\nthis great edifice with renewed interest.\nWhen we pass to the Romans we find\na decadent peoples, with a long history\nof labour disputes - summed up in their\nown proverb - \"Rome was not built in\na day\". Despite this, the Romans were\nkeen biologists and investigated the\ndiet of the larger mammals. One of\nthese investigations is a classic;\nOplus Claudius, \"On the dietary effects\nof feeding lions on various Christians,\nprisoners &c.\" Proc. Ron. Soo. Exp.\nSc. Vol. XXX.WC, Recent attempts to\nrepeat this experiment in the basements\nof the Zoology Dpet. have met with\nopposition, mainly from the Miners who\nhad been chosen as suitable substitutes\nfor the \".. prisoners, etc.\". This\nis ironic justice, for since the time\nof the Romans, knowledge has been\npersecuted.\nAs a fully qualified idiot, I would like to pay tribute to an ever-to-be-forgotten Spaniard, Don Spit\n(penalty \u00a35) who boldly told the Inquisition that the world was round and\nnothing that they could do would convince him otherwise- To prove this, he\nset sail due East one Wednesday and\nthree months later, fell off the edge.\nWhich only goes to prove that there is\none barn every minute.\n\"One what\"?\n\"I'm not 3ure, but it means\nthat there are four more in the world\nsince you started reading this - move\nover a bit, o an't you, it3 getting\ncrowded.\nAnd if some of you ask me, \"where\ndo the Chinese come into the history\nof culture\"? the answer is, of o our se, through chinks in the floorboards.\nDEBATE:\nBritain' sNI ug leak Policy.

To my\nfurther amazement, their meals were then\nserved to them by the already overworked\nref eo tory staff.\nSince reserved tables have not\nbeen allowed, and rightly so, in the\nRefeotory, may we know whether this is a change of policy on the part of the\nRefeotory Casmittee, and why they did\nnot first seek the advice of the President of the Union.\nTours faithfully,\nP.K.

HONER\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nEDITORIAL COMMENT A Mr. Norman Scott, of tha United\nStates Information Service, has said\nthis in a recent article about editorials;\n\"For the reader, the editorial page\ncan help to bring order out of the\nchaos of the glut of daily occur-en ces: fight his battles, set him\nthinking ... and enable him to be\non guard against the editor's human weaknesses in presenting\nand playing the news.\"\nThis quotation is all the more\ninteresting, for recent College discussion has been centred around two\neditorials, one in \"Phoenix\" and the\nother in the la3t issue of \"Sennet*.\nConcerning \"Phoenix\", so much has\nbeen written to this newspaper about\n(mainly) David living's editorial that\nit has been necessary to select from\nthem. An official reply from Michael\nBanks, for Phoenix, is included in this\nissue. While it is ridiculous to create\nthe situation of playing at being a \"controversial free-thinking student\",\nit is equally ridiculous when otherwise adult students stated categorically that the Editor has no right to express personal views in an Editorial.\nHe has every right to do so, if( and\nonly if) there is no attempt to influx\neno e the reader into the acceptance of\nview which is not directly stated, but\ncan be inferred only.\nWhether, in fact, David Irving has\noverstepped that limit is a question of\npersonal opinion - there is a school of\nthought, which rates the Editorial as\ntoo trivial to be worth writing about.\nIn \"Sennet\" the Editor has, to\nsome at I.e., overstepped that boundary.\nFor one thing, the whole problem of\nConstituent College Hostels has been a vexed question for some time in I.C. Unfortunately I.C. has usually been\nneglected, far some time, on the columns\nof Sennet. Now we have aU.L. U. Agent\nand we hope that ha will keep the Editorial Board at Senate House better in farmed. There is, in fact, to be no\nreferendum on the subject of Constituent College Hostels; they will\nnot apparently be bail t. The remarks\nabout I.C. putting their'tribal instincts behind them\" is considered to be in\nrather bad taste, as well as an attempt\nto direct opinion here, or, as Mr. Scott\ncalls it, \"playing the news\".\nThe front page of this issue carries\na topic of interest to all n \u2014mini n of\nthis College - membership of N.U.S. it la important, because - with King's and\nManchester University Union, we are\nout sid that body.\nPerhaps the amount of space given\nin this issue to the Phoenix fracas will\nix la ar this particular Editor of the\ncharge that he is taking sides.\nTHE LONG AND THE SHORT AND THE TALL,\nwhich is at present run r. ing at the Royal\nCourt, Sloane Square, has sufficient\nreality in its theme and dialogue to\nbring home to the audience the poignancy\nand tragedy of the situation; the\nscene is a hut in the Malayan jungle at\nwhich a small British patrol has just\narrived, and when the temperaments of\nthe soldiers have bean revealed, a Japanese prisoner is caught. This\npose w the problem pf whether to kill him, and brings out the indecisiveness\nand vulnerability of men under great\nstress.\nThis will probably move into the\nWest End soon.\nOn Sunday evening at the Festival\nHall i_ a Mozart concert, which will\ninclude his Violin Concerto in D and the\n34th and 38th symphonies: they will be\nperformed by the London Symphony Orchestra under Peter Maag, and Campoli will\nbe the soloist.\nThe last performance this season\nof Verdi's FALSTAFF is being given at\nSadler's Wells Theatre on February 4th ORIGINS GENERAL STUDIES LECTURE\n\"In the beginning, God created the\nworld* and \"in the beginning was the\nprimaeval atom*, may at first seem\ncontradictory: but, suggested Dr. McKay\nin his lecture on Christian and Scienti f Views of Origin, they may be two ways\nof answering the same question.\nScientists study nature in terms\nof cause and effect, while the the is tio view of God is as a cosmic mechanic who\nhas only, to oil and repair the clockwork machine: further, the an theist identifies God with nature to the extent\nof worshipping nature.\nPerhaps the meat way is to think\nof God aa ac as mio artist - first he\nsketches a static scene on the screen\nof a X.T. tube, and this he then brings\nto life:from this stage, the theist\nasserts that the situation will have\nlaws of its own, but the world would\nnot be possible without the stability\nof the artist. He has the origin of the\nwhole show in his mind although his\ncharacter is not necessarily linked\nwith it. By bringing into being a world, God\na lao created its pa at, present and future\nhence Genisis describes the bringing in to being of a> world which already has a past, wh i oh the scientist is now trying to discover. This is the Christian\ndoctrine of creation: the test is whether\nGod is willing to make himself known\nto us - for no so i amt if io discovery is\nanti the tic to this doctrine. If it is\ntrue, scientific facts will fit in with\nit, and should not be disregarded as\nirrelevant, nor should they be confused\nwith any explanations in Genesis which\nare not attempting to answer any historical questions.\nThe world was not created in time\nas we think of it, bat rather was time\nan aspect of God's creation: returning\nto the analogy of the TV'/, screen, there\nand the last two performances of THE\nFLYING DUTCHMAN (Wagner) on February\n3rd and 11th.

Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\".\nIn the North and West (first week\nrelease area) is HOUSEBOAT, a lighthearted comedy starring Sophia Loren:\nshe volunteers to look after\nwidower Carey Grant's children, and the\nend may be forecast with little difficulty. John Boulting is now making a new\ncomedy, I'M ALL RIGHT JACK and if the\ncast (Dennis Price, Richard Atteriborough,\nPeter Sellars, Ian Carmichael and\nTerry-Thomas) is any criterion- it certainly will be \" all right\".\nis no connection between origin in\nterms of the scene depicted there and\norigin in terms of its conception in\ntime - creation is continuing all the\ntime.\nThis world is a fallen world, and\nso in theory it should be possible to\nreturn to the at age where thing were\nbetter, before man knew of cruelty: but\nthe whole s tru ot ute of God's programme\nwas affected by the fall and not just\nsections of it and so the previous state\no an not be discovered by probing the\npast of the present world - all the rules\nof stability have e hanged.

IC IN DEPEND ENC EAT WHAT PRICE ?\nGRENNAN TALKS TO GUILDS\nNU ST he general air of \"sport\" ana entertainment which prevailed at \"Guilds\" Uhicm\nmeetings last term, gave way to a mare serious trend'cop the 15th January.\nA motion that Guilds Uniai should be oom eaf filli a ted to K.U. S. was on the\nagenda, and a certain amount of expectancy was in the air.\nThe lack of experience of serious debate in Guilds became apparent when the\nproposer, Mr. C.H. Satan, announced that he had brought along the President of N.U.S. to address the meeting.\nAn immediate query from\nMr. Chadwiok revealed that Mr. Grstman\nhad not been off io ally invited, and\nconsiderable argument followed as to\nwhether he should speak - reaction\nvaried from the straightforward\nattitude - the man is here, lets hear\nwhat he has to say, to the \"constitutional\" attitude, that someone who is not a member of the Union should not\nspeak when a serious motion is being\ndiscussed.\nAfter considerable wrangling, the\nmood of the House changed to \"let. get\non with it\", The President ruled that\nMr. Grennan should not speak as it would almost certainly affect the vote\nto an undesirable extent, and he then\ncalled upon Mr. Sohan to speak in\nsupport of the motion. Mr. Sohan was\nevidently unprepared to do this and\nafter some further rapid exchanges the\nmotion was withdrawn by the proposer.\nAt this point the mood lightened,\nand Mr. Garnett, who had entered earlier\nand had been allowed to remain by the\nPresident, was seen to be moving stealthily towards the door.\nHe was called upon to remain, and\nanswered queries en several topics\nbefore being allowed to leave quietly.\nAfter \"Any Other Business\" had\nbeen dealt with, the N.U.S. President,\nDennis Greonan, was asked to address\nthe House, and gave an outline of the\nwork.and aims of the N.U.S. He prefaced his talk with an apology far -tie\ntrouble which his appearance had caused\nbut said that he had been given to\nunderstand that the invitation was an\nofficial one; as the invitation was\nnot given by an officer of the Uniai,\nGuildsmen will no doubt require an\nexplanation of this from someone.\nA discussion followed, wh i oh was\nDecerning heated, when the meeting had\nto be concluded owing to shortage of\ntime.\nThe President apologised to Dennis\nGreiman for the embarrassment wh i oh had\nbeen caused him, and thanked him f \u00abr speaking.\nA GUILDS UNION NOTE\nThe question of affiliation to\nN.U.S., has lain dormant for some years\nnow, and I was hoping to hear the\npoints for and against, put by Guildsmen at the last Union meeting.\nUnfortunately, the ease for had\nnot been prepared and the discussion\nonly revealed a desire to know more cm\nthe part of most Union Members. In\nconsideration of this it is perhaps\nfortunate that a rote was not actually\ntaken on the subject.\nA at rc nger lead from the chair\nwas evidently expected, and with se me justification, for the reasons for\nImperial College withdrawing from\nN.U. S.o an only be found by looking\nup old oo pies of \"Felix\" and by searching the Union files. One or two\nadditional reasons far continuance of\nour present position are known only to\nmembers of student committees etc.\nThe reasons are mainly general\nones, and oc no emI. C. as a whole, as\nwell aa the constituent colleges.\nN.U.S. is a non-political organisation, but, in making this claim, it a e an s that it is not o on earned with\nNational Politics, and does not concern\nitself with the left or right-wing\ntendencies of its members. By its very farm, however and by its declared\nalma, its activities are deeply political in that it makes representations\nto Ministers and ministries and, aa\nMr. Grennan told us, prides itself on\nbeing an effective \"pressure group\".\nIn other words, N.U.S. wields a certain\namount of power, and in order to obtain\nthe various advantages of affiliation,\nthis side of its activities must be\ncondoled in all its aspects.\nThe nature of N.U.S. is such that\nthe power w hio his related to the membership claimed, is wielded by those\ninterested and active enough to do the\nwork necessary.\nEDITOR\n-\u2022 OF\nJ fJ pm PHCENIX\nFLEES\n_\nCOUNTRY\nHAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN ?\n-KB . PAGES 3 4 4\nThus, though the bare aims of the\nUnion may reflect a democratic mean of\nstudent opinion, the manner of their\nimplementation may not and it is with\nthis aspect of N. JJ.S. affairs, that I.C. often found itself at variance.\nThe position is aggravated by the\nfact that many of the members of\nN.U.S. are part-time students, giving\nit an \u2014 m ally hi j^i proportion of in active members.\nIt was felt that in important\nmatters I.C. can make its voice heard,\nand this has been barn out in practice.\nArguments,on how far I.C. Union has\nrepresented the Students' a as e on this\nor that National issue, seem to me to\nbe mare criticisms of the present farm\nof I.C. Union, activities than reasons\nfor I.C. to place responsibility for\nrepresentation in the hands of N.U.S. The extant and effectiveness of\nI.C.i nfl ueno e In a given issue is\ndifficult to gauge, but it is even more\ndifficult in the oas e of N.U.S. wh i oh definitely seeks publicity of this side\nof its activities.\nOur moral duty to be represented\non a body wh i oh/__ \u2022\n<\n_\n- to arbitrate on\nour behalf, is no greater than our\nduty to make our own representations cn\nmatters which oc no ern us, and in the\npast it has been found that our obligations are far better discharged in tM La manner.\nThis, then is the or ux of the a rgu ment. There are many other arguments\ncn both sides but these are practical\nmatters and are subsidiary to the main\nissue. The financial aspect in particular is important to \"Guilds* but\nthis is an internal matter and I do not\npropose to discuss it in the pages of\nmix. D. G. Clark\nPresident, City aid\nGuilds Union.\n\n"

PAGE 3*\nAN APPRAISAL.\nThe Quatermass serial which has\nbeen responsible for filling the Television Room in the Union with unfailing\nregularity, is more than just an expert\nessay in the realms of so ie no e fiction.\nTechnically, of course, it can be\nappreciated on several levels. Stop\ncameraman 'Englanders' film inserts at\nalmost any point and an exhibition\nprint could be made; listen to the\nmusic and it is as eff eot ive, in its am\nfield, as the story itself.\nBut it is not even the action\n/hi oh gives Quateraass its appeal both\nto scientific and lay Binds. It is \u2022possibility\". The grim elements of\nthe story are possible, only Just is it is true, but that is sufficient.\nIndeed, reality caught up with Quatara as s the man early on, the first serial\nis now technically (and sensationally)\nout of date.\nNigel Kneale, who has written all the grim episodes has found the weak\npoint of society today. It is a feelin insecurity in the scientific world\nwhich is rapidly developing. Too\noften scientists themselves speak and\nact as if they had God's ear all to\nthemselves. They don't and the man in\nthe street knows it, and is frightened.\nIf the scientists can tackle so much\nthat is frightful, how much mare dreadful and unlocked for mast the final horror that may destroy the world be.\nThis is where the essential humanity of Prof. Quatermass is apparent.\nHe is almost a scientist on the outside - he too, must fight his way through\nthe petty officialdom and smog security\nof men who have power - and believe\nthat that is everything. Viewers feel\nthat Quatermass is on their side, and\no an even identify themselves with him,\nin the fervent hope that when the final\nshadow does fall across society, a \u2022an like Quatermass will be there.\n225-150: Professional bachelor, rake,\nCasanova eto - doomed to be lonely old\nage if he doesn'twa tah out. Likes\nhis liquor straight, his oars and\nwomen fast. Not to be trusted.\nDynamite to the weaker of the weaker\nsex - well left alone..\nI5O-5O: Dangerous; un beat ably attractive, unbelievably intelligent,\nunutterably charming, all male - so\nhe tells you. Also unbearably\nconceited. Improves with old age.\nspecially if left in cold storage.\n0 and neighbourhood: The golden\nmean.

In order to retaliate\nin se me measure we have compiled the\n\"WALEOLK rating\" to help a girl to\nseparate the wolf from the sheep, and\nto make an accurate assessment of any\nman.\nThe so ore opposite each question\napplies to the positive answer, i.e. \"yes\".

    "content": "EDITED BY K.W. LUDLAM.\nRUGBY This term's Rugby began for the\n1 st XV with a game against Harlequins\n\"A\" as satisfying as any we have had\nthis season. Played on a pitch in ex c_ ll \u00abt fX tid it ion wh i oh favoured\ngood open play., I.C. had an exciting\nwin, the final result being 19-^10.\nThe opposition back: division soon\nshowed its potential when their stand\noff Jinked his way th rou gi\"i for a score\nunder the posts. The try was converted I.e. did not reply until, shortly\nbefore half-time when Wright walked over\nthe ^u in s full back to core- The\nconversion from very near the posts was\ntaken in ty pi081!

Cup Pinal,\nfor the first time since 194-8, when\nthey beat Battersea 3-2 on L.S.E.' s ground last Saturday.\nThe ground was in very good cond it ion for the game and right from the\nkick-off the determined I.C. team started putting on the pressure. After\ngoing very near on occasions, the inevitable happened and I.C. opened their\naccount with a fine goal by Coups after\nabout twenty m mute3 play. This was\nsoon followed by two good goals by Exflt\nFinney, but ju3t before the interval\nBattersea replied with a goal from one\nof their break-aways to make the halftime score 3-1 to I.C. In the second half, only fine keeping by Hughes, in the opponents goal,\nprevented I.C. from adding to their\ntotal, Battersea, however, came a little more into the Dicture an i scored\nanother goal five minutes from the end\nof play. The I.C. team,managed to hold\nout for the remainder of the game and\nso play in the final. We should like to thank very mx ch the land of supporters, who, though small really made\nthemselves heard during this important\ngam*.\nI.C. will meet Kings, who beat\nL.S.E.20 in the other semi-final, in the final on February 21st. at Motspur\nPark, when it is hoped th fl t the College\nmascots plus a large contingent from\nI.C. will be present to a j ve the team\nthe support it will need.\nIn the two other matches played on\nSaturday the 2nd XI drew 2-2 with Southampton 2rVi's with goals by Paddle ana\nBullock and the 6th XI were beaten by\nChelsea II*s by 7 goals to 3-C.A.

I.C. were not\ndiscouraged in3 pite of being 10-3 down\nabout 20 minutes from the end and superior fitness began to tell.* A fine\ntry by right wing Milward gave the side\na further 8 points and renewed impetus.\nAlmost immediately afterwards, a quick\nheel by the scrum with the ball going\nstraight out along the line to Milward.\nwho cross kicked, with good positioning\nby Smith and Wright resulted in the\nlatter scoring under the posts.\nPhillips converted. One minute later loose play inside the Quins 25 enabled\nSmith to fall over for another try.\nThe side, now in jubilant form a pain. took play down to the ^u in s where a quick heel on the line allowed Lance to fight his way over, capping a very good\ngame behind the scrum. Phillip again\nconverted, 16 points having been scored\nin as many minutes to finish off a very\nenjoyable game.\nOther Results\n2nd XV BEAT\n\"A\" XV LOST\n3-3\nG.E.C.1 st XV\n0.

The\nusual weather conditions were encountered, and over a snow-covered course\nthe Sheffield University team beat I.C. by 30 points to 52. The six scoring\nI.C. men were Larkum (2), Gilbert (8),\nBrown (9), Clare (13) and James (14).\nThe \"sport\" at Sheffield was, as always,\nexcellent, and a merry band returned in the early hours of Sunday morning.\nOn the same day, our second team\nwere defeated by Westminster College,\n26 points to 29, at Enfield. The\nindividual winner was J. Jaeger, with\nFeam 3rd and Clifton6 th. John Collins, our President, was\nrunning in the Inter-Counties Championships and was the second Bucks,\nman to finish.

    "content": "FELIX7 ROVER CREW\n4 pairs and 2 covered pairs of\nknees met late on Friday evening to\nventure on a night hike. On climbing\nfrom Oaterham ante the Dams, only then\nwas it realised that the night, was a dear, cloudless, sharp and moonlight\nnight. The frost made the going easy\nbut somewhat hard and its keenness kept\nthe party at a brisk pace. On moving\neastwards along the escarpment face of\nthe Downs the re gel beauty of the night\nopened up before us. It was due to\nthe perfection of the night and the\nable leading of C.H. Hookenday that\nthe hike proved most successful and\nfor me at least the best ever attended.\nAfter a quick brew of tea the escarpment\nwas left near Tatsfield and a N.E. course taken through Doune into Chelafield where the 6.33 a.m. train to\nCharing Cross was caught.\nA. CP. SPORT MATCH\nINTER-HOSTEL- SOCCER\nThe keenly awaited challenge match\nbetween the Old and Gardens Hostels\nfinally took place at Harlington on\nSunday, 18th January and resulted in a convincing 9-5 victory for the brilliant\nGardens Hostel team over their gallant\nopponents.\nThe afternoon's entertainment\nbegan with lunch in the pavilion, and\nthen both teams adjourned to the bar\nto decide who should hove the kick-off. This was won by the well-trained\nOld Hostel team by a sip in 60 see's. The teams then summoned up enough\ncourage to venture out into the cold\nair, and were welcomed by the muddiest\npitch Harlington has seen this season.\nThe match was started with a lively\nskirmish between the two wardens\nwhich continued until the referee\ninformed them that the game was played\nwith a ball. The Old Hostel team\nau ick ly settled into their stride and\nwent into a21 lead after, a few min-ute s. However, the Gardens team\ngradually warmed up and, playing magnificent football, went into a52 lead by half-time.\nThe Old Hostel resumed after the\ninterval with plan X and scored 2 quick\ngoals, but the Gardens came back to regain their lead and would have scored\neven more if I.C.'s ballet dancer, Mike\nVine, had not been in superb form in\ngoal.\nAfter the match the teams had tea\nand 22 tired players had an enjoyable\nevening in the customary fashion;\nRIFLE CLUB\nHere is a club which, as has been\npointed out elsewhere, has been extremely\nsuccessful in the University 'Engineers\nCup* and London Small Bore leagues in the past. To date however, team\nperformances (A teams excluded) have\nnot produced quite such good results\nthough they have been far from poor as\nthe following summary shows:\n'Engineers Cup' L.S. B.R.A.

These were against\nthe Metropolitan Police, a victory for\nI.C., against Birmingham University and\nagainst Cranwell, two more victories\nfor the College. In the first of these,\nteam captain,- Neville Ebsworth obtained\nthe best I.C. score and so received\nhis second Silver Spoon from the Police.\ni cw. se.\nIt has been announced that after\nthe matches played last term, the I.C* and Middlesex Hospital Women's swimming\nteam is now showing the top position\nwith Goldsmiths' College in the University of London Women's Swimming Leacue\nAnother victory for I.C. was recorded\non Friday when they beat Westfield by\n27-24. The opposition from Bedford\nwhich included Christine Godden proved\ntoo much in the previous week.\nThe Squash team triumphed over U.C. to win 4-1 after having lost in October.\nUnfortunately a weakened team lost the\nnext week to Kings by 4 matches to 1.\nThe table tennis team was beaten. \u2022 \u2022 <\nThe hockey team would like it to\nbe known that some matches were played\nlast term.

It was formed towards the end\nof last Session but has only just begun\nto find its feet .\nDue to a surprising lack of either\ntables or teams at the London Colleges,\nmatches have only Just been arranged.\nLast term, a snooker match was played\nagainst Regent Street Polytechnic at\nhems.

Sec.\nWATER POLO\nLast Tuesday night, the I.C. water\npolo team, although apparently weakened -through injuries provided the first\nreal surprise of this seasons league when\nthey hammered St. Mary's Hospital, who\nwere unbeaten in league matches for\nnearly 2 years, by 6 goals to 1.\nPlaying fast attractive polo, I.C. soon took the lead, when a quickly\ntaken free throw by Hart gave Jones an\neasy goal. Soon afterwards Jones\nscored a brilliant individual goal to\nput I.C. two up. However shortly\nafterwards Hart was sent out,\" and this\nenabled Marys to reduce the arrears.\nHowever on his return,fine forward play,\nbacked up by sound defensive work from\nBregazzi and Church enabled I.C. to\nincrease the lead to 5-1 by the interval,\nthrough goal* by Basham 2, and Harford,\none of Basham's goals being a fine lob\nwhich completely deceived the goal keep er. Shortly after the interval Jones\nand a Mary's player were sent out for\nindulging in afi stic battle in the\nwater, and soon followed by another\nMary's player, for a foul on Basham.\nI.C. men hammered away at the Mary's goal but had little success.\nOccasional Mary's attacks were o ap ably dealt with, by I.C.'s Australian\ngoalkeeper Macndllan. Finally a goal\nby Harford gave I.C.a61 lead which\nthey held to the final whistle.\nI.C. II have not had such good\nfortune, but did not disgrace themselves in taking only one point out of\n4 from Chelsea, the prospective Div\nIII champions. Scoring 2-1 one week,\nand drawing 3-3 the next. I. C.Ill consolidated their position at the top\nof Div IV with an easy 2-0 win over\nWestminster Hospital.\nOn Friday, I.C. gained a deserved\n7-5 vio tory over Regent Street Poly,\nafter being 5-1 down shortly after\nhalftime. However a weakened second\nteam were unable to keep up the sound\nwork and last 3-2 to St. Barts. Hosp.\n\n"
