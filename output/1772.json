    "content": "Switzerland \u2013 Tout l\u2019univers \u2013 Gjon\u2019s Tears (returning act)\nAnother French language favourite to win comes courtesy of Switzerland and Gjon Muharremaj, or Gjon\u2019s Tears as he\ngoes professionally. His song \u2018R\u00e9pondez-moi\u2019 in last year\u2019s cancelled contest was another big favourite and, personally, I\npreferred it. The two are very similar, however. Haunting vocals delivering fairly abstract lyrics with a very atmospheric\nbig instrumental trying to convey big emotions about life and love, and one\u2019s place in the universe. Gjon has surprised us\nall with his staging. We thought he\u2019d be sat behind a piano on stage, but he dances! And jumps across different elevated\nblocks on stage. It\u2019s a risk and it\u2019s made him fall in the odds, but he is still very much a contender to win.\nItaly \u2013 Zitti e buoni \u2013 M\u00e5neskin\nAs of writing, this is the favourite to win. I don\u2019t like it. Italy have brought us seasoned performers in the rock group\nM\u00e5neskin. Their song, \u2018Zitti e buoni\u2019 (\u2018Shut Up and Be Quiet\u2019) is all about being wild and different \u2013 the key repeated\nlyric being (thanks Google Translator) \u2018We\u2019re out of our minds but different from them\u2019. Lead vocalist Damiano prances\naround stage half naked singing at his fellow band members and it\u2019s all very intense. I do see the appeal. It does reek with\ncoolness and I think televoters will like it a lot. I don\u2019t imagine it will win, though, since the professional juries regularly\nvote Italian acts down and I think this is another one where this will be the case.\nIceland \u2013 10 Years \u2013 Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0 (returning act)\nThis is a sad story. Da\u00f0i og Gagnamagni\u00f0 is a group comprising lead Da\u00f0i Freyr, his wife, his sister and three school\nfriends. This collective is very wholesome, but unfortunately also part of this group\u2019s downfall. One member tested\npositive for COVID on Wednesday morning so they can\u2019t perform live in the shows. Instead, their rehearsal footage is\nbeing used which, to be fair, is very polished and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference if it wasn\u2019t for there being no audi-ence. You might remember their would-be entrance last year \u2018Think About Things\u2019 which, despite not even competing,\ncharted in the UK Top 40 and certified Silver \u2013 Imperial\u2019s very own a cappella group The Techtonics covered it. His\nsong this year, \u201910 Years\u2019 celebrates his 10-year long relationship with his wife and will still likely do very well despite not\nbeing performed live.\nPortugal \u2013 Love Is On My Side \u2013 The Black Mamba\nPortugal have competed in Eurovision 51 times, and this is the first time they\u2019re ever sending a fully English song, which\nis a bit sad. However, I think this is quality and it is accompanied by a compelling stage show. The band, The Black\nMamba, were formed in 2010 and have a blues/soul/funk style. They\u2019ve had quite a bit of success in Portugal. Their song\n\u2018Love Is On My Side\u2019 is written from the perspective of a prostitute and drug addict they met in Amsterdam many years\nago who, despite all of her life struggles, always held onto the belief that \u2018love is on my side, just maybe not tonight\u2019. It\u2019s\nquite touching, I think.\nThe Netherlands \u2013 Birth Of A New Age \u2013 Jeangu Macrooy (returning act)\nOur hosts and reigning champions should be proud of their entry, I think. \u2018Birth of a New Age\u2019 is a very lyrically powerful song about finding empowerment in your routes and about standing up for what you believe. \u2018Your rhythm is re-bellion. Your rhythm is rebellion\u2019 is chanted throughout. The chorus features Eurovision\u2019s first use of the Sranan Tongo\nlanguage of Jeangu\u2019s birth country Suriname: \u2018Yu no man broko mi\u2019 (\u2018You can\u2019t break me\u2019). Jeangu has talked about the\nBlack Lives Matters movement impacting this song, as well as his experiences of being LGBT+. I quite like this one, but\nthe Eurovision fans this year aren\u2019t too keen.\nMalta \u2013 Je Me Casse \u2013 Destiny\nWe have yet another favourite to win with a French song title this year. \u2018Je me casse\u2019 is roughly the French equivalent of\n\u2018I\u2019m outta here\u2019 and this song\u2019s message is fairly well summed up in the climax of the song: \u2018Ladies, if you feel like flaunting tonight, it\u2019s alright. Ladies, listen to me, go ahead and show them you\u2019re shining bright\u2019 (oh yeah, only the rest of\nthe song is in English). Destiny is a powerhouse and without the personality she brings to this performance, there\u2019s little\nchance it would be a longstanding favourite to win. She\u2019s no stranger to Eurovision too having one the Junior Eurovision\nSong Contest in 2015 at just the age of 13. Now, still insanely young at 18, she\u2019s got a fair crack at winning the adult\nversion \u2013 she\u2019d be the first person to have one both!\nCyprus \u2013 El Diablo \u2013 Elena Tsagrinou\nThis year, Cyprus are represented by Lady Gaga! Ok, they\u2019re not, but you wouldn\u2019t be the first one to think this was a\nclassic 2010 Lady Gaga track on first listen. \u2018El Diablo\u2019 has strong \u2018Bad Romance\u2019 vibes, but I\u2019m all here for it. Elena is the\nlatest in a long line of powerful female participants for Cyprus \u2013 one of whom, Eleni Foureira, gave them their best ever\nplacing coming in 2nd in 2018. This is a fairly cheap, fun pop song but has garnered some controversy as the song literally\nis called \u2018The Devil\u2019 and the lyrics \u2018I fell in love, I gave my heart o El Diablo\u2019 suggested Devil worship to some. Also, if you\nget a few mins, watch the music video on YouTube for some outrageous product placement from Head and Shoulders.\nFRIDAY 21TST MAY 2021\nEUROVISION\n10\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Regardless of whether you\nagree or disagree with individual\ndecisions, the current state of affairs\nis a disservice to the students we are\nmeant to represent.\u201d\nThis statement reflects a schism\nin a group of people that have dominated the top level of Union politics\nfor the last two years, many of whom\nBhatnagar campagined for and are\npersonal friends of his.\nBhatnagar also continued his attacks on Council on Twitter, writing \u201cimperial SU is full of vacuous\nliberals and spineless cowards...The\namount of resistance to any sort of\nmotion on climate change because \u201cit\ncan hurt our student societies that are\nsponsored by Shell\u201d is appalling\u201d.\nSome might say that Bhatnagar\nwent too far with some of his com-ments.\nKatie McCann who criticised Bhatnagar\u2019s stance and who he criticised\non Twitter said \u201cI find Ansh\u2019s response\ninherently one-dimensional, judge-mental, and illegitimate.

    "content": "Finland \u2013 Dark Side \u2013 Blind Channel\nOur second rock song in the final this year comes from Finland. They\u2019re no stranger to rock at Eurovision having won the\nwhole contest in 2006 with \u2018Hard Rock Hallelujah\u2019 from rock band Lordi in their ridiculous costumes. Will history repeat itself 15 years later? Probably not. But this will probably do well enough. \u2018Put your middle fingers up // Take a shot,\nthrow it up and don\u2019t stop\u2019 sum it all up fairly well. It\u2019s a rebellious song. It\u2019s some rocky dudes shouting about anarchy\nand turning things on their head. It\u2019s a fun 3 minutes.\nRussia \u2013 Russian Woman \u2013 Manizha\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you might completely hate this at first. But, to be honest, I do love it now. The problem is it\ntakes a few listens and some deeper diving into the meaning to get it. The song sets out a history of Russian women over\nthe last few centuries and the transformation of the identity of women in the country. This Russian-English song is about\nempowerment and strength \u2013 \u2018Every Russian woman needs to know // You\u2019re strong enough, you\u2019re gonna break the\nwall\u2019. Alas, Manizha, who was born in Tajikistan and came to Russia as a refugee after the Tajik Civil War, received a lot\nof domestic hate saying she isn\u2019t a Russian woman so shouldn\u2019t sing this song. Even death threats came her way. People\nare really silly, aren\u2019t they?\nBelgium \u2013 The Wrong Place \u2013 Hooverphonic (act)\nI\u2019m very happy this qualified. It drips in coolness and quality \u2013 nearly so much so that I resent it, but the group Hooverphonic, joined by lead singer Geike Arnaert, are friendly and approachable enough to not cross this line. The song\ndoesn\u2019t take a lot to understand \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a one night stand gone wrong and the singer is lying in bed, feeling in\nthe wrong place, willing her encounter to leave. The stage performance is nowhere near as dramatic as the music video\nwhich sees Geike beheading her lover\u2026\nSpain \u2013 Voy A Quedarme \u2013 Blas Canto (returning act)\nBlas Canto is a lot hotter than this song, but it\u2019s just as cute. Translated as \u2018I\u2019ll stay\u2019 - it\u2019s a reflection of a lot of sadness that\nBlas has faced over the last year. He lost his grandmother to COVID, and his father died just before the pandemic. This\nsong is an ode to long lasting love. It\u2019s nice, but it won\u2019t do very well and I fear Spain are headed for last place this year.\nThere\u2019s a massive balloon on stage that\u2019s meant to look like the Moon - so that\u2019s something to look out for. And, I\u2019ll let\nyou be the judge of whether or not Blas\u2019 climactic note is just him screaming or not.\nSerbia - Loco Loco - Hurricane (returning act)\nOne of the biggest dance songs of the year is Serbian language song \u2018Loco Loco\u2019 by the group Hurricane. Two of the\nmembers have already appeared on the Eurovision stage - one in Junior Eurovision, and the other in the adult competition in 2016. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t really know what the song is about. Something about \u2018I\u2019ll drive you loco loco\u2019 I think.\nIt\u2019s good fun, either way. I am terrified, though, that the pyro in the performance will melt the layers of makeup off these\ntalented ladies faces, though.\nAlbania - Karma - Anxhela Peristeri\nIt\u2019s pronounced \u2018Angela\u2019 apparently. Albania nearly always these days send big ballads sung by extremely talented female\npowerhouses. This is no exception. However, this year it leaves me a bit cold. It might be because of how dramatic it is - I\nkind of feel like it\u2019s better suited to a film soundtrack rather than the Eurovision stage. But maybe that\u2019s just me. Either\nway, Anxhela sings the hell out of this and just for that I\u2019m not too mad to see this in the Grand Final. Again, don\u2019t ask\nme what it\u2019s about cause I don\u2019t really know - but this is a good thing! Keep singing in your native language, Albanians.\nUnited Kingdom - Embers - James Newman (returning act)\nLast, but by no means least, it\u2019s us. Woo woo! Will we win? No of course not. Should we be proud of what we\u2019ve given\nthis year? Yeah, I think so. James Newman is a fairly big name in the British music scene. His written for the likes of Calvin Harris, Jess Glynne and Little Mix. He\u2019s also the brother of the admittedly more famous John Newman. Our song\n\u2018Embers\u2019 is, unlike us in recent yeras, a bit of a bop. What we\u2019ll definitely be remembered for are the two MAHUSSIVE\nstyrofoam trumpets we\u2019ve somehow managed to ship to Rotterdam that flank James on stage. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll end up\nlast, and we can proudly flag the Union Jack this year.\nFRIDAY 21TST MAY 2021\nEUROVISION\n11\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Bulgaria \u2013 Growing Up is Getting Old \u2013 Victoria (returning act)\nMy heart goes to Victoria from Bulgaria this year. I blubbed like a baby the first time I heard this song and I am not\nembarrassed by that. Victoria Gerogieva rose to prominence in Bulgaria after coming 6th in their X Factor \u2013 she is often\ncompared to Billie Eilish, but I think she also carves out her own style. The song is very calm and gentle, yet very captivating and reaches a beautiful crescendo. She wrote it about feeling time slipping away from her and what it feels to carry the\nweight of adult life: \u2018I\u2019m torn by nervous system\u2019s aching\u2026 anxiety is draining\u2019 and I think this message resonates widely.\nIn her stage performance, the sands of time fall freely from the ceiling yet stop when she tries to touch them. Though\nfairly sombre throughout, the song ends with an a cappella message of hope: \u2018If your world is breaking, and growing up\nis getting old // Know that you\u2019re worth saving, and getting up is all you\u2019ve got\u2019 *gulp*\nIsrael \u2013 Set Me Free \u2013 Eden Alene (returning act)\nIsrael, our previous competition hosts, have come with a fairly polished act this year that made it through despite expectations that the current situation with Israel might make that harder. \u2018Set Me Free\u2019 has a slightly confusing message to\nme. It talks about feeling in a prison by a lover and Eden belts \u2018set me free\u2019 repeatedly at the climax, yet she also says \u2018I\u2019m\nyour reason, spicy season, like we did before\u2019 so doesn\u2019t seem all that keen to be free. Look out for the Maria Carey-esque\nwhistly notes she pulls off masterfully at the end. In fact, she managed to reach a B6 note in the semi-final which was the\nhighest note every reached in Eurovision\u2019s 65 years \u2013 quite the achievement for Eden (who is, incidentally, petite).\nLithuania \u2013 Discoteque \u2013 The Roop (returning act)\n\u2018Let\u2019s discoteque right at my home // it is okay to dance alone\u2019 \u2013 this was definitely the correct choice of song to kick off\nEurovision this year in the first semi-final. I\u2019m sure there were many people watching with only themselves to dance with\nat home who would usually have many people around in a normal year. The song has a slight 80s funk vibe, but has many\nof the same sonic quirks that The Roop\u2019s favourite-to-win song \u2018On Fire\u2019 did in last year\u2019s cancelled contest. Whilst not\nquite a favourite to win this year, Lithuania have done themselves proud with this fun song about being yourself, and\nexpressing yourself. You\u2019ll love the eccentric dancing on stage and the energy of lead vocalist Vaidotas.\nAustria \u2013 Amen \u2013 Vincent Bueno (returning act)\nMany had completely discounted this before the rehearsals began, but it\u2019s been creeping up since. I\u2019ve personally been a\nfan from the beginning and has been in my personal top 10 since I first listened. Funnily enough, this is one of two songs\nin this year\u2019s competitions called \u2018Amen\u2019 (the other being Slovenia, but it didn\u2019t qualify so you won\u2019t see it here). The song\nis fairly simply constructed but Vincent delivers a very compelling vocal performance. The lyrics (\u2018Amen, I guess, you said\nthat it\u2019s time for us to put // our love to rest\u2019) apparently have a dual meaning depending on your interpretation \u2013 either\na fairly classic metaphor for a breakup, or more deeply about the death of a family member.\nGreece \u2013 Last Dance \u2013 Stefania (returning act)\nThis year has had quite a few 80s throwback tracks (I think we have Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus and The Weekend to thank\nfor this) and Greece is one of these. \u2018Last Dance\u2019 is fairly catchy and Stefania\u2019s strong vocal isn\u2019t masked by the dance\nbeat. The music video for this (if you watch it, you\u2019ll agree it rips off Lorde\u2019s \u2018Green Light\u2019) sees Stefania riding on a flying\nhorse through space and they\u2019ve tried to translate this visual experience on stage. Through a clever use of green screen\ntechnology (which, as they keep reminding us, is novel to the Eurovision stage) we see silhouettes of men dancing and\nStefania floating in mid-air. I do quite like this one, and it very likely will reach the top 10.\nGermany \u2013 I Don\u2019t Feel Hate \u2013 Jendrik\nThis is my number one guilty pleasure of the year. Jendrik, who is a bundle of energy yet also extremely kind and cute, is\njoined on stage by \u2018fingers\u2019. These fingers accompany the key theme of the song \u2018I don\u2019t feel hate, I just feel sorry // so you\ncan wiggle with that middle finger it\u2019ll never wiggle back to you\u2019 basically saying that hate bounces off him and he won\u2019t\nrise to it. However, unlike in the music video, these fingers are officially not a middle finger to keep the family friendliness\nof Eurovision. You will really love or hate this when you first watch it. I hated it when I listened 2 months ago but it\u2019s\ngrown on me massively since and I think this might surprise to do fairly well on the night.\nFRIDAY 21TST MAY 2021\nEUROVISION\n9\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

This was\na broadcast event where candidates\nfor major roles were able to speak\ndirectly to their voters and audience\nin a way that would otherwise have\nbeen very difficult to do. I was very\nproud of it and also of the candi-dates. Despite not being able to do\nmany of the things that make being a\nstudent volunteer worth it there were\nstill candidates for nearly all of the\nmajor roles.\nHowever, this was less the case in the\nless senior roles. We face a case of\n\u2018cultural long COVID\u2019. Many societies face decline, a huge loss of expertise and potentially even ceasing\nto run. This is because many people\nhave looked at the trouble of running for a committee position and\nhave decided that they won\u2019t bother.\nI would plead with anyone reading\nthis. You will have benefitted from\nstudent run activities and it is our responsibility to pay that debt forward\nto the students that come after us.\nWith many AGMs around now\nand the summer elections coming up, there is a frequent refrain\n\u201cEverything is rubbish\u201d that can be\nheard. I have said it every election\ntime and I will say it again this time;\nif you want something done better,\ngo and improve it yourself.\nObvious career benefits aside, many\nof us have a once in a lifetime opportunity to redefine ourselves. A victim\nof severe brain trauma once wrote\nthat for her it was not only the head\ninjury that changed her personality\nand led her to leave her home town\nin the US and remake her life. It was\nalso the long time spent in recovery\nthat allowed her to re-evaluate what\nshe felt was important.\nAll of us now have that chance too.\nIf you didn\u2019t like who you were, you\nhave a chance to change that. I know\nwhat I sound like but I am filled with\nthe zeal of the convert.\nFelix made me who I am today. There\nare societies out there that will do the\nsame for you. You only have to go out\nand find them.\nFRIDAY 21ST MAY 2021\nEDITORIAL\n5\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nWe here at Felix believe that it is always in the interests of the students to\nknow. That cover-up and paternalistic\nobfuscation is never right and that\nas intelligent people students should\nbe treated with respect and given the\nability to make up their own minds.\nTherefore, I, the Felix Editor, on behalf of the team promise that:\nWe will to the best of our ability tell you the whole truth and\nnothing but the truth.\nWe will keep your confidence\nand will only publish something\nyou say to us if you have explicitly\nsaid that we can.\nWe will work to expose unfairness and discrimination in all\nforms that it takes both at the\nCollege and elsewhere.\nWe will treat fairly any article\nsent to us, regardless of point\nof view and do our best to work\nwith you to prepare it for publication it in our pages.\nSignedbyCalumDrysdale\nEditor-inChief\n\n"

Working over two weeks\nand late at night the two men, Feb Senton, 48, and\naccomplice Gaaron Uha recently turned 43, stripped\nAylesbury Parish Church of its lead roof. This meant\nthat on the following Sunday, unbeknownst to the con-gregation, they had a direct line to the Lord. Everyone\nin church that day was surprised when their prayers\nfor Mrs Miggins not only fixed her sore back but also\nknocked 60 years off her age and gave her a successful\nmedium sized catering company. Other prayers had\nsimilarly strong effects with Mr Jones\u2019\nprayer for an end to his baldness\nresulting in 100% body hair coverage and 7-year-old Olivia Philips\u2019\nprayer to be a princess causing a\ncoup in Brunei.\nA spokesperson for God told\nNegaFelix that \u201cGod hadn\u2019t heard\nany prayers in centuries, so when\nthese ones came through, he might\nhave acted a little enthusiastically\u201d\nThe Pope has declared that the\ntwo metal thieves will be canonised.\nTheologists have suggested that this revelation may\nhave significant repercussions on interpretations of\nscripture as now, rather than trying to decipher ancient\nHebrewandAramaicscrapsofparchmenttheycanjust\nask God what he meant.\nFor example, early reports\nsuggest that Moses might made\na number of spelling errors when\ncopying down the Ten Commandments.

I am upset and\ndisheartened by the ongoing injustices\nand inhumanity. I spent the last couple\nof weeks glued to my phone, refreshing\nmy Instagram and Facebook feeds at\nleast every 15 minutes.\nOne minute, I am inspired by the confidence of Palestinian writer Mohammed\nEl-Kurd, a resident of the Sheikh Jarrah\nneighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem who, along with several other Palestinian families, is threatened with forced\ndisplacement from his home by an Israeli court. He challenged a CNN anchor he was being\ninterviewed by:\n\u201cDo you support\nthe violent dispossession of me and\nmy family?\u201d.\nThe next minute,\nI stare in disbelief as the IDF\nviolently storms\nAl-Aqsa mosque,\nthe third holiest\nsite in Islam, during the ten holiest nights of the\nholiest month of the Islamic calendar,\nRamadan. Worshippers were being shot\nat with rubber bullets and were having\nstun grenades thrown at them.\nThe narrative and language that most\nmedia outlets used to describe the vio-lence, particularly phrases like \u201cconflict\u201d\nand \u201cclashes\u201d, are inaccurate because of\nthe massive disparity of power at play,\nwith one side illegally occupying the\nother for over 70 years, breaking several\nUN resolutions in the process. Organisations like Human Rights Watch and\nB\u2019Tselem, an Israeli NGO, have written\nreports that show how Israeli policies\nmake apartheid (the intent of maintain-ingdominationofonegroupoveranoth-er) a reality for millions of Palestinians.\nIt is important to condemn violence\nthat leads to losses of both Palestinian\nand Israeli lives. It is also important to\nhighlight how disproportionate the recent attacks on Gaza are, and what the\ncontext of the Gaza strip is. It is one of\nthe most densely populated regions in\nthe world, with 2 million people living\nin a 365 square-kilometre area, which\nalso happens to be under a 14-year-old\nblockade. The economic situations are\ndire with an 82% employment rate and\n53% of the population living in poverty.\nWith May being mental health awareness month, it should be noted that 95%\nof Palestinian children\nin Gaza also suffer\nfrom deep psychological distress because of the threat\nof conflict and uncertainty of what\nthe future holds.\nRefugee camps,\nresidential areas,\nschools, media of-fices, medical cen-tres, and a coronavirus testing\nlaboratory have\nall been targeted\nby the recent airstrikes on Gaza. Over 200 Palestinians\nhave been killed as of Tuesday, including 63 children and 36 women. These\nare not just numbers to be lost under\nthe mounting statistics: each innocent\nloss of life represents a person, like you\nand me, who had hopes and dreams for\na better future.

    "content": "A month on- what was the ESL?\nThe founders of the European Super\nLeague announced it with the intent to\n\u2018save football\u2019 \u2013 to reignite a generation\u2019s\napparentlylostpassionforthegame,and\nprovide blockbuster fixtures and steady\nrevenue for clubs week after week. The\ndream didn\u2019t last long though, and backlash from fans, media and pundits, and\neven Governments led to the league effectively dissolving just two days after its\ninception.\nWhat was the European Super League?\nThe European Super League, or ESL,\nwas the dream of club owners and CEOs\nto stabilise a footballing world rocked\nby the Coronavirus . It consisted of 15\nmember clubs, 12 of whom signed up\nstraight away, and a further 3 who would\njoin them in the subsequent weeks. Five\nother clubs would then be able to join,\ncreating a 20-team league which was divided into two groups.\nThe league was to be played very\nmuch like any other, with the addition\nof quarter- and semi-finals leading up to\na final not dissimilar to the Champions\nLeague.\nWho was behind it?\nThe clubs initially behind the ESL\nwere Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid from Spain, Juventus, Inter\nMilan and AC Milan from Italy, and\nthe \u2018big six\u2019 of Premier League football\nin England \u2013 Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal.\nHow did it fall apart?\nAs soon as the league was announced,\nprotest erupted among fans. The actions\nof clubs furloughing staff during the\npandemic to \u2018save wages\u2019 had already\nsoured relations between supporters and\nowners, and now what was seen by many\nas an ill-disguised cash grab was a step\ntoo far.\nSpearheaded by former players and\nSky Sports pundits Gary Neville and\nJamie Carragher, impassioned pleas and\ncries for sanctions rang out all across Europe.TheUKGovernmentevenpledged\naction to prevent the clubs joining this\nbreakaway league, as clubs from all tiers\nof football condemned the move.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why the idea was\nso controversial. With payouts in the region of hundreds of millions of pounds\njust for signing up, with no danger of relegation for founder members, this was\nseen as a cushy business plan for those at\nthe top of their respective clubs, to ensure their \u2018elite\u2019 pedigree remained while\nguaranteeing broadcast revenue and\n(they assumed) vast ticket sales to fans\nwho would be salivating to watch some\nof the biggest clubs in world football\ncompeting week in, week out.\nAfter sustained protests from fans \u2013\nwhich culminated in groups gathering\noutside clubs before games in spite of\nlockdown restrictions \u2013 and scathing\nmedia coverage, Chelsea and ManchesterCityledthelineinwithdrawingfrom\nthe ESL. The other four English clubs\nsoon followed, as did AC Milan, Inter\nMilan and Atletico Madrid. The remaining clubs vowed that the dream was not\ndead, but despite this, the Super League\nwas suspended shortly afterwards. Barcelona, Juventus and Real Madrid remain convinced - at a board level - that\none day this idea will come to pass, but\nfor the time being at least, it\u2019s 1-0 to the\nfans, and to football as we know it.\nTheo Hales Sport Writer\nPhoto credits: Steffan Pr \u00f6\u00dfdorf\nFelix cryptic Crossword\nAcross Down\n2 Encourage our man abroad to rest in a\nheap (6)\n5 To arrest a policeman (3)\n7 Initial brave officer investigates London cooking (4)\n8 Target of desire weirdly in a tomb (8)\n11 Stupidity!

Thankfully for\nthe College, post Brexit negotiations\nagreed full access to such EU research\nfunding programmes for UK institu-tions, however, did not include access\nto Erasmus, which will instead be replaced by the new British-funded Turing Scheme.\nWhile the EU Commission has historically awarded Imperial a significant amount of mon-ey, totalling \u00a3192\nmillion between\n2015 and 2020, and a\nrecord \u00a344 million in\n2019/20 alone, this\nonly made up little\nover 10% of total research funds.\nEU Commission funding is also\ndwarfed by funding from other avenues such as UK research councils and\ncharities. The Bill\nand Melinda Gates\nFoundation alone granted the College\n\u00a334 million as an award for Malaria\nresearch in 2020 almost equalling the\nEU funding of that year.\nWhile the EU is not a major funder\nof Imperial research, the sudden loss\nof ~10% of research budget is not triv-ial. The College\u2019s March 2021 shows\nthat the 2020/21 funding year has had\nthe lowest funding application success\nrate on record. Projecting forward\ndata from the first half of the year,\nfunding from the EU can be expected\nto be a 1/3 than it was when Britain\nwas still a member of the European\nUnion. This is compounded further\nby weak application success rates from\nnon-EU sources.\nHowever, there remains hope that\nImperial\u2019s reputation as a centre of research excellence will insulate it from\nthe worst effects of Brexit. Near the\nend of 2019 the Royal Society stated\nthat R&D funding from the EU had\ndropped 28% since the announcement of Brexit. Imperial\u2019s record runs\nquite contrary to this, and in fact the\namount awarded by the EU Commission to Imperial has increased every\nfull year since 2016. This suggests that\nthe College has been able to make its\ncase for funding heard, despite the\nturmoil affecting the rest of the sector.\nWhat role of Britain\u2019s own government will play in making up the\nshortfall in funding remains unclear.\nA central tenet of the Brexiteer\u2019s dogma was that the EU was strangling innovation and science. Boris Johnson\u2019s\n\u2018levelling up\u201d agenda is an attempt to\nmake use of this putative opportuni-ty. Measuring the flow of state money\nto Imperial is complicated by the numerous research councils that channel public money into universities,\neach of which receive money from a\nnumber of sources. In addition to this,\nsome government departments have\nbeen known to award smaller sums\nof money targeted at specific research\ninitiatives. Despite inexact figures, it\nis suggested that Imperial still manages to receive a significant share of\nthe research budget, being awarded\n~\u00a3194 million in total from the gov-ernment, the NHS and research councils combined in 19/20. The March\n2020 budget included an increase in\nR&D funding for universities by 20%\nto \u00a310.36 billion and lays out a further\nincrease to \u00a322 billion by 2024/25.\nAssuming that Imperial continues\nto attract the same proportion of the\nexpanded funding pool, the resultant\nincrease in money would far outweigh\nthe decline in EU funding.\nBrexit unlikely to have any major\nimpact on Imperial research funding\nSamuel Lovatt News reporter\n\u201c\nTHE EU\nCOMMISSION HAS\nHISTORICALLY\nAWARDED\nIMPERIAL A\nSIGNIFICANT\nAMOUNT\nThe Turing Scheme will replace the Erasmus programme and will allow students to study abroad. The Turing scheme will send students all over the world rather than just the EU\n\n"

    "content": "Norway - Fallen Angel - TIX\nRidiculous costume: check. Dancers dressed as dark angels: check. Key change: you betcha. This year\u2019s most quintessen-tial, over-the-top Eurovision entry comes courtesy of singer-songwriter TIX from Norway, who\u2019s apparently a fairly big\ndeal there and has written songs for some big names including Ava Max\u2019s \u2018Sweet But Psycho\u2019. His stage name has a fairly\ndeep meaning \u2013 reclaiming the nickname \u2018tics\u2019 bullies at his school gave him due to his Tourette\u2019s syndrome. \u2018Fallen Angel\u2019 has strong Westlife break-up song vibes but apparently has a deeper message about mental health to it too, and TIX\nhas spoken admirably openly about his own mental health struggles to Eurovision press. As an almost definite PR ploy,\nhe\u2019s taken a fancy to Azerbaijani singer\u2026\nAzerbaijan - Mata Hari - Efendi\n\u2026 Efendi, and the two have been doing cute things like leaving gifts in each other\u2019s hotel rooms, singing songs for each\nother and have been spotted spending time together in, conveniently, press heavy areas. A video about the two even went\nup on Eurovision\u2019s official YouTube channel on their semi-final day (no clue why, it was very strange). But enough about\nthat. Efendi comes with a solid rip-off of her song from 2020 \u2018Cleopatra\u2019, but this time the historical female figure is Mata\nHari, a Dutch exotic dancer who was executed after being charged for spying for the Germans in WW1. The song is\nfairly decent \u2013 an upbeat ethnic number that gets performed confidently. While \u2018Mata Hari\u2019 has fairly throw-away lyrics,\nEfendi herself comes with a lot of controversy following views she has publicly shared around the Azerbaijan-Armenia\nconflict.\nFrance \u2013 Voil\u00e0 \u2013 Barbara Pravi\nCaptivating. Magical. Impactful. Mesmerising. Compelling. I could go on. France introduced a slightly new national\nselection show C\u2019est vous qui d\u00e9cidez! and from it we have been given songstress Barabara Pravi and her extremely\nFrench song \u2018Voil\u00e0\u2019, which won garnering over 50% more points from the French juries and public than second place.\nBarbara, with Iranian and Serbian roots, is a very engaging person who has used her platform as an artist to talk about\nissues related to women\u2019s rights. As for \u2018Voil\u00e0\u2019, the lyrics tell the story of a performer laying herself bare to her audience,\nand the vulnerability that comes with opening yourself up to the criticism of others. The last verse\u2019s lyrics (my own\ntranslation) \u2018Finally take a look at me, my eyes and my hands // All I have is right here\u2019 give a good feel for this beautiful\nsong. It\u2019s spent time being first in the odds to win, and I\u2019d be delighted if it does.\nUkraine \u2013 Shum \u2013 Go_A (returning act)\nUkraine really know how to do Eurovision well, without ever producing disposable pop \u2013 and this year is no exception.\nThey\u2019re being represented by electro-folk band Go_A, whose name roughly translates as \u2018going back to roots\u2019 and their\nsong borrows heavily from Ukrainian folklore \u2013 so much so that they had to rework the original significantly to comply\nwith Eurovision plagiarism rules. A growing favourite amongst the fans, \u2018Shum\u2019 is a Ukrainian language song written to\nhonour traditional Ukrainian songs attached to the spring ritual, and sung in the traditional \u2018white voice\u2019 open throat\nstyle. In essence, it\u2019s an ethnic bop and this song wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a rave.\nSan Marino \u2013 Adrenalina \u2013 Senhit ft. Flo Rida (returning act)\nYeah. I\u2019m not kidding. Flo Rida is at Eurovision this year. And for San Marino, the smallest country in Eurovision with a\npopulation of just 30,000 odd. But, no, don\u2019t worry you shouldn\u2019t be thinking \u2018I had no clue Flo Rida was Sammarinese\u2019,\nhe\u2019s not and neither is Senhit but San Marino rarely sends acts from their own country (for obvious reasons). Italian singer Senhit is no stranger to Eurovision. As well as her not-to-be participation in 2020\u2019s contest, she previously participated\nfor San Marino in 2011 but did not qualify. Her fate is set to be very different this year. \u2018Adrenalina\u2019 is a high-energy\n\u2018fast-music\u2019 dance track that is a big favourite amongst the fans. Flo Rida\u2019s appearance certainly doesn\u2019t hurt her chances\nbut she teased for weeks whether or not he\u2019d actually be able to attend, with a lot of doubt around this given just a week\nago he was witnessed at a bikini competition in Florida.\nSweden \u2013 Voices \u2013 Tusse\nThis is very Sweden. They\u2019ve nailed their Eurovision formula to a tee and, while it\u2019s getting quite predictable at this point,\nit works for them; they\u2019ve come in the top 5 of the grand final in seven of the last nine competitions. The problem is,\nthere\u2019s rarely much to say about them these days. \u2018Voices\u2019 is catchy, it\u2019s well produced, well presented and decently enough\nperformed (considered the singer very recently underwent vocal-chord surgery). And all of this But that\u2019s kinda just it.\nTusse himself is lovely with quite the backstory \u2013 he was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but came to Sweden as a refugee at the age of 13 separated from his family. Given he\u2019s still only 19, he\u2019s come far in very few years.\nFRIDAY 21TST MAY 2021\nEUROVISION\n8\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe Acts in the Grand Final (all photos courtesy of the EBU / Andres Putting)\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 21TST MAY 2021\nEUROVISION\n7\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nHello, there! I\u2019m Shervin and you might know me better as your Deputy President (Welfare) at the\nUnion. While I\u2019m extremely passionate about welfare. There\u2019s one thing I\u2019m more passionate about\n- and that\u2019s Eurovision. Although, I think the two go hand-in-hand and Eurovision can be very\ngood for your wellbeing. I\u2019m here to give you the lowdown on this year\u2019s compeition. I run\nyou through all the acts and tell you the things to look out for, as well as giving some personal\ninsights on my favourites.\nFirstly, though, a bit of history. How did we get where we are today? Well, Eurovision\nstarted in 1956 as a way of bringing post-war Europe together through music. Switzerland\nhosted and won that year, and ever since the competition has grown and grown. There are\nnow up to 43 countries competing in the competition - including Australia who, though not\nin Europe, are a member of the European Broadcasting Union so get to compete.\nThe format is easy enough to understand. Every country sends an original song and then perform\nthis live at the host country. The host is always the winner of the previous year (unless they turn it\ndown, which has happened sometimes when the country is struggling financially, for example). Before\nthe grand fi- nal on Saturday night, there are two semi-finals where all but 6 of the competing countries battle it out for 20\nplaces in the grand final. The 6 who don\u2019t need to go to the semi finals are the \u2018big 5\u2019 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) who make greater financial contributions to the competition, as well as the host country. At the final, the 26 qualifying acts perform\nagain and then a winner is chosen. The winner is a 50/50 combination of votes from 5 professional jurors from each country, as well as a\npublic televote in each country.\nLike everything we hold dear to us, COVID has put a spanner in the works for Eurovision. In 2020, the competition was cancelled for the\nfirst time ever - breaking a 64 year streak of the competition running. This was, of course, heartbreaking for the fans but, of course, more\nso for the artists. The timing of the pandemic meant that all 42 acts had already been chosen for that competition and they were already\npreparing for their performances. Most countries allowed them to get another go this year - 26 of 39 competing countries have come with\nthe same act (but different song) to last year - and I\u2019ve indicated who these are in my description below!\nTo everyone\u2019s joy, Eurovision has returned for 2021 and, after the win of the Netherlands and Duncan Laurence\u2019s \u2018Arcade\u2019 in 2019, the\ncompetition is being held in the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam. There are, of course, strict COVID measures ensuring all people are kept\nsafe but, amazingly, only two so far have had problems. Australian travel restrictions meant they didn\u2019t come to Rotterdam and, instead,\nused a pre-recorded \u2018live on tape\u2019 performance (which didn\u2019t make it out of the semi-finals, alas). Also, one of the Icelandic performers\nhas tested positive for the virus which, alas, means they will use rehearsal footage. Given the scale of the competition, I think it\u2019s amazing\nthey\u2019ve managed to do it so far with very little problems and only a smattering of positive tests. It\u2019s really amazing to see, after so long of\npeople being apart, hundreds of people from different countries coming together for the greatest television show in the world.\n\n"
