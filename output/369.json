    "content": "FELIX Alan Lodge\nDR. WOLFF gave a fascinating lecture on a side of medical\nengineering that tends to get forgotten. Too much work is being\ndone on artificial limbs at the detriment of the psychological side.\nMan has been living in\ncommunities for the last\n20,000 years; on an evolutionary time scale. Man has\nnot become used to the\nconditions imposed. Little\nwork has been done to measure\nstress in every day-situations,\nor to measure heartbeat,\nsweating and so on.\nBut this was impossible\nonly about ten years ago, and\nonly with the introduction of\nSAMIs, Socially Acceptable\nMeasuring Instruments, that\ncan measure parameters like\npulse rate but are very compact,\nhas any reel advance been\nmade in the field.\nDr. Wolff then showed some\ningeniously simple devices\nthat have been made for\npensioners to help them stay\nIndependent: an inflatable air\ncushion that helped them\nstand up from easy chairs was\nthe most ingenious. There are\nmany more partly disabled\npensioners then people needing\nartificial kidneys, so it is an\nimportant field.\nOr. Wolff then \u2022 changed\ndirection to talk about representation of data. He\nshowed a slide of a typical\nsymptoms cars: it was virtually\nundecipherable. So he has been\nworking on visual readout\ntechniques. This consists of a card (or CRT) with eight axes\nspreading out from a central\norigin. A single circular shape\npassing through the appropriate\npoints on the axes gives an\ninstant sum up of the patient's condition.\nTo take the same readings\nwith a machine as can be taken\nwith the finger on the pulse\nwould take an enormous unit\nwhich would have to measure\nabout six difficult parameters.\nA computer cannot compare\nwith a man at reading data.\nBut it seems that when we\nrecognise things or people we\nonly actually recognise certain\nfeatures. We were shown\npictures of teddy bears: despite\n\u2022the fact that they were only\nmade up of buttons, everybody\nagreed they had definite\nexpressions.\nremind me of certain friends...\nWELLSOC has about half a dozen lectures to come this\nterm: the next one is RIOT\nCONTROL IN ENGLAND TOO?\nIf you riot often, it might give\nyou some food for thought.

    "content": "s Fit IX\nMichael Williams DOES THE ICU Executive need to\nbe expanded? This Is one of the most\nfundamental constitutional issues to\nhit the Union for some time. The\nquestion was broached very early in\nthe year when the President asked the\nrest of the Executive to consider having\nthree more officers as members. These\nwere the officers responsible for\nExternal Affairs, Academic Affairs and\nPostgraduate Affairs.\nThe majority of the Executive\ndecided to block the first two but agreed\nthat there could be a case for letting\nthe Postgraduate Affairs Officer become\na member.\nDespite the fact that the Exec have\nallowed the PGAO to be present at all\ntheir subsequent meetings, the overall\nfeeling pro his becoming a full member\nhas since altered to one of neutrality.\nThe bland phrase conceived was 'trie\nExecutive have been unable to reach a decision on this Is^sue'. The motion\noriginally drafted for presentation at a UGM which would have finalised the\nPGAO's Executive status has been\nwithdrawn because the original proposer.\nJohn Mortimer (President of RSMU), has\nessentially changed his mind. The\nsecond er, Peter Teague (President of\nRCSU), Is apparently unchanged in his\nattitude. In next week's FELIX we will\nbe publishing a feature based on this\nsubject. Presenting the case for the\nadoption of the PGAO as an Executive\nmember will be Trevor Phillips (Pres-ident of ICU) & Ton Abraham (PGAO);\nand presenting the case against will be\nRon Kill (Dep. President) and John\nMortimer. Part of the discussion will\nbe based on statistics gleaned from\nother UK Colleges and Universities\nregarding the size and composition of\ntheir Executives. We have also received\nsignificant comments from John Carr\n(President of ULU and NUS Executive\nmember) and John Randall (President\nof NUS).\nShould anyone feel strongly enough\nabout the subject, please feel free to\nair your views in the 'Letters' column.\nOne can only speculate on the\nsuccess or otherwise of today's National Grants Demonstration, but I am\npessimistic about what it will achieve\neven with the large turn-out which\nJohn Randall expects.\nRecognising that cutbacks in education have already been planned by\nthe Government, to expect an additional\noutlay in educational spending is\noptimism in the extreme. It smacks of\nthat old tactic 'let's aim high and then\ncompromise'.\nLKTTEA8\nA Letter to the Rector.*\nOld Chemistry Building,\n8th November, 1974.\nSir Brian Flowers,\nRector,\nImperial College.\nDear Rector,\nWe represent the postgraduates in the Department\nof Chemistry, and are writing\nto you concerning the construction of a 'landscape\ngai ien with shrubs', described\nm this week's edition of\nC, to be built on the\nn tel of land ormer ly occupied\nby part of tii e old RCS building\nand designated for stage II of\nthe new Chemistry building.\nThe first two pages of the\nsame issue of TOPIC were\noccupied by a memorandum\nfrom the Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals\ndescribing the financial\ndifficulties facing British\nUniversities, as a direct\nresult of which research\nfacilities needed by postgraduates and staff are steadily\nworsening in both this and\nother Departments of the\nCollege, with the future\nbecoming progressively bleaker\nif the present trend of financial\ncuts is continued.\nThe proposed garden w j ll do little to enhance the view\nof the vicinity, owing to the\nhalf-demolished, half-built\nstate of the buildings which\nsurround it on ' three sides,\nand we are disgusted that at\npresent tr in e, money can be\nwasted on such trivia.\nIs it possible for the\nCollege Administration to\njustify this presumably not\ninconsiderable expenditure for\ndubious cosmetic purposes, in\nview of the present precarious\nfinancial situation, and could\nthe money involved not be\nbetter employed in improving\nthe buildings from which the\ngarden and shrubs are intended\nto distract the attention?\nYours sincerely,\nR.B. Jones,\nS.J. Roberts.More on I.C.L. Dept. of Chemical\nEngineering.\nSir,\nI feel I must protest about\nMr. Phillips' self-centred\ninterests in human suffering in\nother countries. His remarks\nabout an ICL computer being\nused for administration in\nSouth Africa, and so perpetuating apartheid, seem very\nminor compared to the amount\nof suffering and killing carved\nby the computer systems\ninstalled in US ships and\naircraft, and also those of the\nO A etc.\nIt seems then, that Mr.\nPhillips thinks we should\nbuy American and condone the\nnapalm in g of Vietnamese\nvillages etc. in years gone by,\nand does not care about anyone\nexcept his 'race', or he is just\ncontinuing his left wing policy\nof denigrating anything British.\nThe computer is merely a rod of those who use it.

Ramyead,\nAdviser to Students'.\nIndian\nDiwali - India's Festival\nof Lights.\nDiwali, (which is an abbreviation of Deepawali) falls\nin the later part of October or\nthe first part of November\ndepending on the vagaries of\nthe lunar calendar. This year\nthe Diwali falls on November\n13th. Its religious and mythological roots can be traced\nback to the Ramayana, one of\nthe two gnat epics of ancient\nIndia, which centres around\nthe legendary hero, Rama.\nUpon the promptings of his\nthird wife, Rama's father King\nDasharatha of Ayodhya (a Kingdom which covered most\nof Eastern U.P.) exiled him\nfor a period of 14 years. Rama\nwas accompanied in exile by\nhis wife Sita, and by the eldest\nof his three brothers, Laxmana.\nOne day, while Rama and\nLaxmana were out hunting,\nSita was abducted by the Demon\nKing Ravana of Lanka (in\nCeylon). The Ramayana tells\nin details how Rama organised\na great host and crossed to\nCeylon on a bridge of stones\nto give battle to Ravana and\nrescue Sita. The defeat of\nRavana is celebrated in the\nfeast of Dussehra, which\noccurs about three weeks\nbefore Diwali. Diwali marks\nthe return of Rama, Laxmana\nand Sita to Ayodhya. It is said\nthat their return was marked by\nscenes of tumult o us rejoicings\nand that the people of Ayodhya\nwelcomed them back by lighting\nup their houses with earthen\nlamps.\nThus symbolically, Diwali\ncelebrates not merely the\nreunification of the family,\nbut also a return to the rule\nof law, for Rama has come\nback to claim the throne which\nas Dasharatha's eldest son,\nis rightly his.\nBut whatever the symbolic\nand mythological significance\nof Diwali. its unique place in\nthe Indian calendar of festivities comes from its\nassociation with things which\nare much more basic and which\naffect the feelings of the\npeople far more profoundly.\nWhat makes Diwali bigger by\nfar than Guy Fawkes day in\nEngland, or Jury 4th in\nAmerica, is its intimate connection with the soil, with the\nweather.\nDiwali signifies the end\nof the long lean season from\nApril to October, when the\nspring harvests are in and the\nwinter crop has been planted.\nTowards the end of October\nthe maize crop has been\nharvested, and the early paddy\ncrop is lying cut and stacked\nin the fields. The main paddy\ncrop is maturing, and the\ncountryside is a waving sea\nof green.\nThe days shorten, the sun's rays slant more and more in\nthe late afternoon, and their\nfierce whiteness is tinged with\ngold. An unbroken succession\nof cloudless sunny days lie\nahead, until the winter rains\nquicken the soil for the fruit\nit will bear in spring. Winter,\nthe time of plenty, lies ahead.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SPORT\nCROSS COUNTRY\nOn Saturday November 2nd the Cross-Country club made its\nnow annual t np down to Wye College for a three cornered match\nbetween us, LSE and Wye followed as usual by a bonfire party\nand piss-up. The course at Wye was shortened but still contained\nits renowned exponentially rising hills as well as a ploughing\ncontest, little baa-lambs and\nRUGBY\nother sundry bits of nature.\nSuperstar Rob Allinson although not going flat out came\nfirst and broke the course\nrecord (and didn't do a luggage\nrack much good later on).\nSteve Webb wasn't far outside\nthe old record either when he\ncame second. Ian Ellis and\nGranny Clarke also finished\nhigh up the field to give IC a comfortable win over LSE followed by Wye who only\nnarrowly beat our second team.\nThe bonfire party was much\nenjoyed hy all, thanks to some\nreal ale, although Ian\nIsherwood fell over in a dip\nthat had been used as the\ngents.\nThe following Wednesday\nwe had a tough fixture at\nSandhurst, which unfortunately\ndue to transport difficulties\n(a cock-up) we were unable\nto turn out our fullest team for.\nAfter watching the array\nwarm up by numbers we set off\nover the two lap course which\nwas very flat but had some\ninteresting features, e.g.as sul t course, soldiers helpfully pointing the way every\ntwenty yards (oops'.metres) and\na rather large stream. Rob\nAllinson was again first back\nin 25:35 in 3rd position. Ian\nEllis was 5th in 26:10 followed\nten seconds later by Steve\nWebb, another ten second gap\nsaw Granny followed by a large number of Sandhurst\nrunners and a few Irish guards\nbefore Rich Harrington and\nPete Johnson came in 18th and 19th. Due to this large gap\nIC were beaten into second by\nSandhurst though we came a long war)in front of the Irish\nguards. A battle of the giants\nbetween the last four in each\nteam was not uns up ri singly\nlast by IC by a big margin.\nThe tea was as usual very\ngood afterwards though we\ncame away rather lacking in\nsouvenirs!\nSOCCER C1UB\nOur first four teams set out\nlast Wednesday on the long\nand tedious journey up North\nto Romford, there to do battle\nwith Queen Mary College. The\nweather for once was ideally\nsuited to a decent game of\nfootball and all four matches\nhad their share of thrills and\nskills. Our 4th team fought\nwith great spirit and enthusiasm\nfor the full 90 minutes but\nfound the strength and sometimes underhand tactics of the\nopposition too much for them,\neventually floundering 2-1. The\nthirds also lost, going down\n4-2 after leading 2-1 at half\ntime a result which must surely\nindicate a lack of fitness\nsomewhere in the side. The\ntwo success stories of the\nday naturally come from the\nfirst two teams. Our erratic\nseconds turned on the heat\nearly on aad kept on top for\nthe rest of the game winning\nconvincingly 4-1. The firsts\nin' a tough match came out on\ntop by the only goal even\nthough they had to really\nextend themselves for a full\ntwenty minutes when fullback\nD. Ansell went off with bad\nnuts.\nOn Saturday the 1st round\nof the London University Cups\nwas played and all our teams\nwere at Harlington. The only\nshock of the day was the fact\nthat the 1st team were taken\ninto extra time by SCESS (who\nare they?) but they finally\nmanaged to stick one in (thank\nGod!) and so pass on to the\nnext round. Our seconds\ncasually strolled over our\nfourths by an approximate\nmargin of eight goals helped\nby the return of that demon full\nback with two left legs R. KH1\n(who's he?) and by an impressive 4 goal tally by\nM. Clark. The thirds lost 0-3\nto Queen Mary seconds, let no\nmore be said about that, while\nthe fifth team gave us something to write home about by\ndefeating Birkbeck thirds by\nthe impossible margin of 4-1.\nAll in all not a bad Saturday's sport \u2014 if all the coaches had\nturned UP to take us home....\nK. LIPSCOMBE\nIC 1st entertained Harlequins *A' at Harlington on Saturday\nand came out winners by 22-10. The day began with the routine\nWAFU with coaches, several people being seated on the floor of\nthe bus on the way out. Not deterred by this the team turned out\nonly a few minutes late this week, and from the kick off the IC\nforwards dominated the opposition with Bradley playing\nwell. The first twenty minutes\nof intense IC pressure saw\nHarlequins 4-0 in front and it\nwas only when the IC pack\nwalked off for tea and biscuits\nthat the home supporters had\nanything to cheer about.\nD. Forbes kicked two very good\npenalties to give IC a64 lead\nat half time. The teams\nchanged ends and IC were now\nplaying down the slope and\nwith the\" wind, which at times\nwas quite strong. The IC pack\nconsidered this an advantageous time to return to the\ngame and sped back onto the\nfield. They continued to\ndominate the scrum s(11ar le quin s won about 2 in the whole of\nthe first half) and supplied the\nbacks with a good deal of ball.\nIt was in this half that the\nexciting action took place.\nFrom a scrum in front of the\nHarlequins' posts the IC pack\nstood up to see R. Hughes\nstanding back, do yet another\nbad kick and miss with a drop-goal attempt. Undeterred by\nthis failure Hughes shaped up\na similar attempt from another\nset scrum a little later. The\nball seemed certain to miss\nwhen a fluke gust of wind\nblew the ball between the\nsticks \u2014 the drop-goal race\nwas on! Ray (50 pounds lighter\nthis week) Hughes now concentrated his attention on the\ntry race. Bruce Bradley was\nplaying a blinder. IC won the\nball from aru ck and from a brilliantly conceived move by\nLipscombe, Feam put Hughes\naway on a simple 50 yard run.\nto score a try with the e jsc present Lipscombe at one\nshoulder (and Anita on the\nother). Dave Forbes converted\noff a post. Bradley continued\nto play well. Forbes slipped\nin a penalty goal sometimes\nand Harlequins scored a mediocre try which was con-verte d. The scoring was\ncompleted by another IC try.\nThe ball reached D. Shakesheff\non the wing (miracles!) and\nafter some neat inter passing between himself and Bob\nStem the Frog dropped over\nfor a. try in the corner. Dave\nForbes missed a difficult\nconversion. The game petered\nout amidst the descending\ngloom and rain. Bradley\ncontinued to play well. The\nfinal whistle went, the teams\nhurried off for tea and biscuits.\nThe game marked the return\nof Bo Bo Scutter in the centre\nfor the first time since his\nencounter with Ruddoh Levelbottom. Gerkin Phlegmbag ran\nthe line. Vocal support was\ngiven by Mr. Astoneless of the\nA's international squad, with\nBradley playing well.\nOnce again there was a coach cock-up leaving 9 IC\nmen stranded. The journey\nhome was lightened however,\nby carol singing at the Ariel\nHotel ably led by Mr. Astoneless from the roof of the\nbus-shelter. Mr. Flanagan\ncollected and Mr. Bradley\ncontinued to sing well.\nTeam: D. Forbes,D. Shakesheff.\nR. Stern. M. Cotter, A. Williams,\nR. Hughes, T. Fearn. B.( played\nwell) Bradley. B. Austin,\nD.T.

    "content": "P.G AFFAIRS\nCORNER\nTom Abraham IT IS college policy that, on academic grounds postgraduate\nstudents should not be employed on work of a tutorial nature.\nThis is doubly unfortunate because not only does it withdraw a, source of Income from hard pressed students (more about this\nlater), but it also denies those of us who hope to become lecturers\nthe chance of some teaching experience. At a time.when the\nunion is complaining about the quality of undergraduate teaching,\nit is ironic that some union officers support college policy on\ntutoring.\nMany of you have been\ncirculated with a document\ndetailing the serious financial\nposition of universities and\ncolleges. The situation in\nImperial Co!leg e is that we\nface a \u00a3500,000 deficit in the\ncoming year. To combat this,\na2% cut on expenditure has\nbeen instituted. However, since\nthere can be no cut on\n'salaries' and maintenance,\nthis 2\n% cut has to come from\nother sources of expenditure.\nIt is in the light of this that\nmany departments have cut\ndown on demonstrating, with\nthe distinct possibility that\nafter Christmas demonstrating\nwill be phased out completely.\nPostgraduates can on average\nears something in the region of\n\u00a3120 by demonstrating. The\ngrant from the SRC is \u00a3960 and\nso demons lr sting pay constitutes about 10% of the total\nincome. It is scandalous that\nthe financially weakest\nmembers of the college have\nto bear the major burden of the\nexpenditure cuts. We fully\naccept that the College is\npassing through a period of\nacute financial stress, and\nas such would only be too\nwilling to bear our fair share\nof the burden provided other\nmembers of the college are\nalso ready to make the\nnecessary sacrifices.\nIn the present situation it\nis imperative that the IC\npostgraduate group which\nrepresents ALL the postgraduates in the college,\nmeets and formulates policy\nmandating the committee to\nmake the necessary representations. For too long, we\nhave been inconspicuous\nwithin the college 'community'.\nRejected by the academic staff\nand unable to come to terms\nwith the undergraduate oriented\nstudents union, we have tended\nto hide away in our little\ncomers in various parts of\nthis concrete jungle. It is time\nthat we got together and build\na strong postgraduate group,\nand in this way improve both\nthe social and academic\naspects of life at this college.\nThere will be a meeting of\nthe IC Postgraduate Group on\nThursday the 21st November\nat 1p.m. In Elec. Eng. 305,\nand I hope most of you will\nmake a special effort to attend.\nRECENTLY a directive was issued by the Rector to the effect\nthat (and I quote only at n'tfs hand) no postgraduate may do any\ntea c wag of other students in the college unless this week is\nsupervised by the lecturer or another member of staff. It is also\nsaid that there has been more specific ruling against PGs doing\nany form of tutoring or work\ninvolving assessment counting\ntowards a' degree. Certain\nexplanations for these rulings\nhave been attributed to Sir\nBrian, but these seem so\nnonsensical that I would not\nwish to insult him by repeating\nthem.\nFELIX (Nov. 1) reported\nthe Rector as saying that\npostgraduates may not do\ntutoring: this bare statement\nand these orders issued by\nSir Brian overlook several\npoints. First, that in the past\nat this college PGs have\nsuccessfully undertaken all\nthese types of work with no\nmore supervision than that\ngiven to members of staff doing\nsimilar work. (Arguments\ncentered on what happens at\nother universities are totally\nDURHAM\n\u00a3 S A. Richard War ing THIS WEEK Students at Durham were voting on the issue of\nthe University's financial involvement in South Africa.\nFollowing an intensive\nfocus of attention on the\nissues at stake, Durham\nstudents have an unprecedented\nopportunity to. show the\nUniversity where its morality\nshould lie. The Vice Chancellor\nhas requested 'a clear mandate\nfrom a well-informed majority\nof the student body' before he\nis prepared to d is invest, as he\nacts as trustee for every\nmember of the University.\nDurham Students Union is\nasking members to vote for\nd is investment and hopes to\nget 55% support. Whether the\nVice Chancellor will accept\nthis as sufficient is in dispute.\nThe decision to d is invest will be taken in the light of\nthe student vote combined with\n\"that of the staff. The final\nresult will not be known until\nthe New Year when it is\nexpected that the Academic\nElectorial Assembly will have\nvoted.\nIt is certain nothing will\nbe done unless the vote is a large one in favour of dis-investment. The Registrar is\nquoted as saying, \"It would be\na great pity if there wasn'ta substantial tum out at the\nJCR's as it will beg the\nquestion of what the silent\nmajority think'.\nDSU is calling for each\nstudent to pull his weight and\nshow the University that it has\n'a clear commitment to see\nliberty and justice returned to\nthe coloured population'.\ndismissed so we'd best if\nthem too). Second, that certain\nPGs are, in fact, currently\nperforming tutorial work, the\nRector* s injunction against\nsuch practice having reached\ndepartmental level some three\nweeks into the term \u2014 well\nafter timetables had been\narranged according to previous\ncustom. ; The re-timetabling\nthus caused has been disruptive\nto all concerned. (This strange\ntiming and the lack of consultation with PGs, UGs or\nstaff must cause some surprise\nin view of the care taken by\nthe Rector in gathering\nopinion about issues such as\ncomputing and the use of\ncollege facilities by outsiders.\nSuch hasty and perhaps ill considered action seems\nuncharacteristic).\nFurther, the type of work\nactually involved in what is\ntermed demonstrating or\ntutoring varies considerably\nfrom department to department\nand, while in some situations\nsupervision (whatever that\nmeans) of the demonstrator\nmay easily be effected, in\nothers it may be entirely\nimpracticable or even meaningless concept. Implementing\ncollege-wide such a decree as\nhas .'been made would often\ninvolve duplication of effort\n(and thus effectively a decrease\nin teaching resources for the'\nsame financial outlay) with\nno assurance of any increase\nin teaching standards: a decrease might be thought\nlikely.\nIt may be that undergraduates would usually\nprefer example and tutorial\nclasses, etc., to be taken by\nmembers of staff rather than\npostgraduates (qualification*\nwise at least); however, it is\nalso the case that in many\ndepartments students have\nbeen pressing for such classes\nto be made smaller in order,\nto gain better attention to\nin divi du a: problems. ; These\nare also calls for a move from\nexample to tutorial classes,\nto achieve this would either\nimpose a heavier work-load on\nthe staff or necessitate the\nemployment of postgraduates.\nSimilarly, to prevent PGs from\ndemonstrating or tutoring\nwould lead to classes being\nlarger and the solution to your\nproblems even more remote\nthan at present.\nIC POSTGRAD GROUP\n'Calling All PGs'\nGENERAL MEETING\nThurs. 21st November.\nlp.m. Elec.

In having this performance, the society hopes to bring an\nunderstanding of the East by the West through music.\nEastern music is a form where the artist elaborates on a fixed theme (or rage) \u2014 using all his abilities and emotions to\nsynthesis e sounds which are portraits of his soul. The sitar Is\none of the most popular instruments of India. This popularity\nis spreading into the West, initially through masters like Pandit\nRavi Shanker and Ostad Vilayat Khan, and now through artists\nsuch as Shri Nikhil Banerjee and Shri S.L. Bhandari.\nShri S.L. Bhandari is an artist who draws inspiration from\nthe great masters of sitar such as Ustad Vilayat Khan and\nPandit Ravi Shanker. The sitar is a part of Shri Bhandari's soul.\nHis deep understanding of the ragas he plays and the rhythms\nhe improvises bring him closer to the transgression of the soul\nto the infinite. Shri Bhandari's early training was with Professor\nB.M. Dutta of Lahore. This has stood him in good stead over\nthe years and has led him to serve at the feet of his present\nGuru, the great Shri Uma Shanker Mlshra.\nShri S.L. Bhandari will be accompanied by Shri R.S. Plaha\non the tabla. Shri R.S. Plaha domes- from a deeply musical\nfamily and was Initiated into Indian classical music by his\nfather, a talented tabla player. At present he Is a disciple of\nUstad Allah Rakha.\nThe tan pura, an accompanying instrument will be played\nby Miss Bina Chatterjee.\n\n"

Rolt: Victorian Engineering\n(Penguin)\nTHE Great Exhibition of 1851 marked\nthe high point of nearly a century of\nBritish domination of all forms of\nengineering. At the time of the exhibition, Britain was rightly known as the\n'workshop of the world', a status which\nshe was soon to lose and never.again\nrecover. The story of this rise and the\npeople who helped to bring it about is\none of inventiveness, ingenuity and\ndaring. It is this story which Mr. Rolfs\nbook tells.\nStarting with the earliest form of\nsteam engine, the Newcommen Engine,\nMr. Rolt traces the development of steam\npower up to the invention of the turbine.\nThe book also describes the many other\ndevelopments which took place as a result of increasing use of steam power\nand the money which this made available.\nThus we also find histories: of steam\ntrains, and the rails and bridges which\ncarry them, metal ships, and the iron they\nwere built from and the propel lor s which\ndrove them, and of steam powered\nfactories, and the gas and electricity\nwhich lit the homes of the factory owners.\nIn fact, the branching process which\ntook place in engineering during the\nVictorian era seems endless, and the\nbook attempts to cover them all.\nDuring the course of the book Mr.\nRolt also tries to show some of the\nsocial effects of the Industrial Revolution,\nunfortunately because of the tremendous\nemphasis on the 'wonder of engineering'\nthis comes across as something of an\nafterthought and out of place in the book.\nHaving just been told what a magnificent thing steam power was and how\nawesome was the size and might of steam\nengines,, the brief mention of the app aUng conditions in the industrial north seems\ntrivial.\nAs a history of the Industrial\nRevolution from an engineer's point of\nview, i found the book both interesting\nand enjoyable to read, I was especially\nInterested in the comparison it made\nbetween the modern, highly specialised\nengineer and his general and almost\nomniscient equivalent in the Victorian\nera. My only crit is is m of this book is\nthat it attempts to cover to much material\nin too few pages. The result of trying\nto mention every last item of Victorian\nengineering and also pass social comment on them is that the book seems\nslightly disjointed and the changes of\nsubject from one paragraph to the next\nare a little abrupt at times. Despite this\ncrit is is m,I enjoyed reading this book\nand can recommend it as an informative\nand highly readable account of the\nIndustrial Revolution.\nStanley Ellin: 'The Man from Nowhere'\n(Penguin).

IC had a slightly rearranged forward\n41ne up and initially were not\nlinking together too well.\nNevertheless, steady pressure\nwas maintained throughout the\nfirst half with any opposition\nattacks being efficiently dealt\nwith by the IC defence. Jim\nMarshall as right back had a particularly good game\ncovering the left as well when\nnecessary. Keith Arrowsmith,\nthe midfield workhorse, seemed\nto be everywhere, mopping up\nin defence and setting up\nattacks.\nAt half time we turned into\nthe rain and again battle\ncommenced in the mud. The\nsticky conditions made ball\ncontrol difficult yet late in\nthe second half IC finally\nscored when an attack on the\nleft found Bob Middleton (not\noffside for a change) in space\nin the centre.

Well\ndone lads!\nTeam: Roy Hutson; Jim\nMarshall, Rich Cameron;\nKim Howden, Keith Arrowsmith,\nTim Hanson (Capt); Dave Lord,\nlan Maclain, Bob Middleton,\nJohn Andrews, Mike Vieyra.\nIC 2nd XI, supplemented with third team faithfuls, turned up,\nfor their home match against Chinnor 2nd XI, with 12 players\nplus trainer (a performance to date, this season). Chinnor did\nless well, producing only 10 players. In our bene vol ant nature,\nwe offered a player to even the numbers and the lot fell upon\nKen Rawlings. _\nPete Nowell played a good\ngame in midfield and Dave\nHaiders on put up his usual\ndependable performance, but\notherwise I don't know what\nhappened to the rest of the\nteam that put 7 goals past\nGoldsmith three weeks ago.\nI hope players won't be too\ndic courage d by the poor match\nand that we can show improvement next week.\nInspite of beating us by\nhimself, I would like to thank\nKen Rawlings for his devotion\nto duty over the last year. He\nhas been an invaluable main\nstay in the halfbacks and he\nalways added a great deal to\nthe spirit of. the club.\nFrom the bully I could see\nit was a mistake to have given\naway such a worthy player,\nespecially as it was his last\nmatch for IC and consequently\ndetermined to make an im-press ion. Cunning Ken ripped\nthrough the field like a fart\nin a gooseberry bush (Oh! sorry\nKen, didn't know you read\nFelix) and scored the opening\ngoal, for Chinnor. IC rallied\nto the extra challenge, though\nand evened the score after a penalty corner. Ken, not to be\noutdone, however, appeared to\ntake us on single handed\nbefore shooting home a second\ngoal before half time.\nThe second half was evenly\nbalanced with both teams\nmissing good scoring opp-ort unities. Unfortunately the\nball didn't seem to run for IC\nand there were some pretty\nhorrid errors from most players.\nTeam: N. Harrison, J. Huckle,\nP. Nair. A. Webb, A. Hall,\nP. Nowell, C. Parker, I.

IC started the match really\nwell and press uri sed the\nopposition line for the first\nten minutes, but failed to get\nthe pill under the sticks.\nShortly after this Bart's scored\ntheir first try leaving the IC\nteam in confusion. B. Pants\nstarted to loose his cool at\nthis point and of course started\nblaming the backs; one member\nwas even screamed at for\nfastening his boot lace. By\nhalf time Bart's had added\ntwo more tries and IC's only\npoints came from a fumbling\ntry by Ray Hughes, making the\nscore 22-6\nAt the interval the captain\ngot his rag out and tore most\nof the team to pieces except\nof course the magnificent front\nfive who were incident ly winning their own little game.\nThe oranges were quite juicy\nanyway.\nIn the second half IC were\nplaying with the wind which\nmade things easier; and D. Forbes kicked an early penalty\nTHEATRE Angela Wye: 'The Rialto Prom'\ndirected by Sue Todd'.\nTHE PLAY was the first in a series\nof amateur productions based on the\ntheme 'Sex and Consciousness' showing\nat the 'Almost Free Theatre' in Rupert\nStreet, just off Piccadilly Circus. (Here\nthey are presenting short, half-hour\nplays every lunchtime for which you\n'pay as much as you can afford (!)' to\nsee).\n'The Rialto Prom' (which was exceptionally well-cast) was all about a group of Liverpoolian girls on the\nproverbial 'Saturday-night out', and the\ninitiation ceremony they lay on for an\ninnocent newcomer. Before the packed\nauditorium's eyes (grand total of about\nfifty) they transform this rather prim and\nproper 'beginner' into something approaching an imitation beauty queen (tart \u2014\nyou fool!). Anyway, it transforms, in the\nend, that all this is in aid of fleecing\nwallets off poor unsuspecting (gullible)\nmales.\nThe play is supposed to be a send-up\nof the rigid conventions and sexual roles\nand was unlucky with a couple\nof other attempts. Plenty of\nscrum ball was provided\nthroughout the game but there\nwas a great shortage of good\nsecond phase ball and it is\nrumoured that in between\nscrum s tha IC pack ripped off\nfor a cup of tea. Due to this\nshortage of meaty possession\nthe IC backs found penetration\ndifficult even with some of\nthe female supporters pushing\nthem on from the touch line.

Perhaps that's what kids go\nfor today, but I can't help feeling that\nthere should be at least a taste of toffee\nin the gaudiest wrapper.'\nThe jokes themselves were collected\nfrom school-age kids, and on reading\nthrough you should remember about half\nof them and pick up dim memories of\nsatchels, homework and high voices.

Could the\nsame not be applicable to God?\nMost people have the belief, if they have one at all/that man\nwas created in the image of God, not because a leprechaun\nappeared in their bedroom, but merely because they believe man\nto be supreme and all powerful in totality and finality. Thus in\nessence they have created God in man's image. Therefore, man\nis God and vice versa.\nGdd is good, if so how can countless Injustices and social\nparadox ic* prevail in our society. GOD IS DEAD. Thus\nDescartes' famous maxim */ think therefore I am' implying existence in can des ces areas even his great intellect could not\nfathom.\nIn a discussion about God one is inevitably drawn into a discussion about morality and permissiveness. To quote Asimov,\n'Never iet your sense of morals prevent you from doing what\nis right'. More often than not discussions of this sort have\ninherent socio-political camouflages.

    "content": "FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FREi! No. 369 FRIDAY, 15th NOVEMBER, 1974.\nNATIONAL GRANTS\nDEMONSTRATION\nAbolish The MeansTest\nEnd Discretionary Awards\nEnd The Spouses Contribution\nNo Discrimination Against Married Women\nCOACHES LEAVE\nTHE UNION ARCH\nTODAY 12.45pm. I....,i THIS WEEK is Grants Action Week. At IC the main effort\nwill be attendance at the National Demonstration on Friday\n(TODAY!). Coaches leave the Union Arch at 12.45 p.m. So be there!\nTrevor Phillips told FELIX\nthat he hoped to have gathered\na group of people to go to the\nParliamentary lobby in protest\nagainst the Spouse's Contribution which took place\nyesterday (Thursday). He\ncalled upon all IC students to\nsupport the grants campaign.\nWhile Imperial College\nUnion supports the idea of a week of action, at the National conference in July we\nproposed that the week of\naction be held later in the\nyear. This was because of the\ndifficulty in mobil ising fresher s and the fact that we all feel\nbetter off due to the 25%\nincrease in the grant \u2014 which\nhowever, only covers inflation.\nOuters are, of course, \u2022 still\nexisting on low grants. The\nSpouse's contribution is a case in point, NUS's policy\nis still to call for an end to\nthe Means Test and fair,\nequal grants for all students\nas a right,\nTrevor Phillips considers\nthat many students have been\n'bought off by the last grants\naward' and that the Executive\nhave 'not had the time or\nsupport to mobil is e students'.\nSo prove him wrong!\nTHE NATIONAL Demonstration today takes place against a background of economic crisis, financial uncertainty, and rising\nsocial tensions. The question to be asked and answered is:\n'Why a still higher grant, after the rise of up to 35%. this year,\nin the present economic crises?'\nA Fair Grant\nFor ALL\nStudents!\nThe answer is simple:\nThis is not just a campaign\nfor higher grants. The sit-nation is much more serious\nthan that. We are fighting not\nonly for the means by which to\nlive while undergoing on r education; we are fighting for\nthat education itself.\nWe have seen already\nsome \u00a3182 million cut from the\neducation budget. We have\nseen oar Rector warning of\nthe fate that faces the College\nif Government aid is not\nforthcoming by Christmas \u2014\na complete exhaustion of on r reserves inside 18 months.\" The\nonly other choice seems to be\na drastic, slashing cot in\nservices, courses, numbers of\nstudents and staff at the\nCollege. And that is the\nseriousness of the situation.'\nSo it is not just a case of\nstade nts shouting 'more money'.\nWe are looking to save the\nkind of standards of education\nthat we believe should be\npreserved; in this we should\ntorn a common cause with all\nothers in the Education\nsector. So we call on all those\nm the College, not just\nstudents, who share our view\nto join us today.\nThe meaning of the lack of\nfunds in education is clear,,\nin terms of student pockets.\nWe have heard one call from\nthe Rector for an extra \u00a3100\non the grant to meet the erosion\nalready caused by inflation,\nWe can see the hardship that,\nthe anomalies in the grant\nsystem are causing to many\nstudents, particularly postgraduates and married students.\nAnd there is still the Means\nTest, to make parents (who\ncan ill afford it) pay for an\neducation that you have won\nby your own efforts.\nIt is not enough for us to\nsay we support these aims.\nWe must show our support.\nThat is why every student\nwho believes that the education system should survive\nshould be out today, marching for\nA FAIR GRANT FOR ALL\nSTUDENTS;\n\n"

    "content": "lr IL\n'\n-AKC0RD5\nAndrew Osborne\nLittle Feat - Feats Don't Fail He\nNow \u2014 Warner Bros.\nToo many groups take themselves\nseriously and claim they are contributing\nto aesthetic pleasures of the masses.\nIt's refreshing to hear a bunch of lunatics,\nonce in a while, and Little Feat fall\ncomfortably into that category. Their\nhumour Is Zappaesque; their music soul\norientated.\nBut soul music never sounded like\nthis before. The album could so easily\nhave been over-produced but somehow\nthe music comes through and the production really works. Take 'Down the\nRoad' for example: phased guitar zooms\nback and forth across the stereo and\neffects generally freak out, but it never\ngets heavy. There's some fine guitar\nwork throughout the album and every now\nand again some honky-tonk piano pops\nup. Worthy of note is the track 'Skin it\ni Back' which sounds like a demented\nI Pink Floyd playing reggae ('I wonder\n.how. I'm gonna tell It to you. skin it\nback') and it ends with some enigmatic\ni scraping.\nHonours for the best track go to 'The\nFan' which Is zappa esque in the extreme.\nIt's a song about a groupie, in 7/8. with\nexcellent synthesizing.\nI 've never heard of Little Feat before\nand the cryptic sleeve notes are no help\n(apart from suggesting we stop them on\nthe street and ask them about it). The\nsleeve notes also say the group\nexperienced 'a lets get it out in the open\nand make some money off it syndrome\nthat creeps into our unfettered post-general sar not f lites'.\nThis album will give one or two\npeople some pleasant surprises.\nMike Oldfield - Hergest Ridge\nTake one Irish Wolfhound, 'Avon\nCalling' tunes, a bunch of kids who\ncannot play recorders (or lh at equivalent)\nthe best of the tapes which did not make\nTubular Bells, do 19,760 overdubs and\ncall it Hergest Ridge. Bells' was beautiful\nshame Ridge is an anticlimax.,... ;well, at\nleast the first side is.\nThe album starts with a blast of\nvarious horns breaking into the 'Avon\nCalling' chimes which are then overdubbed a million times. This then breaks\ninto some distorted recorders which\ngradually die away and lead into the\nfirst bit of serious music. The most\nrefreshing part of the first side, I consider to be the bass-guitar break, which\nshows the ability of Oldfield to combine\nrock music with classical overtones,\nThis concludes side one, with the sound\nof a Wolfhound being castrated.\nThe second side is totally different\n(Oldfield must have really excelled\nhimself writing this). This is Hergest\nRidge, the first side being but a filler.\nThis side is pleasantly orchestrated,\nhowever, extrapolation from Bells are\nextremely evident The strings are\npredominant and carry through a furious,\nrhythm with some impressive acoustic-guitar playing building aft to a fins!\ncrescendo. Oldfield manages 'to Mend\nMarmalade - This House is RockingEMI Records'.\nREMEMBER the sixties when groups\nwere all composed of minors and the\ngeneration gap was in vogue? Well, the\nyoung rebels of those days have proved\nthey have staying power, though little\npersuasive power, and they still pound\nout music as they approach middle age,\neven though they have neither mellowed\nnor changed their values. Couid it be that\nthe establishment has acted on that old\nmaxim 'if you can't beat them join them?*\u2014\nmaxim 'if you can't beat them join them?'\u2014\ni could have sworn that the mu zak I heard\nflowing, almost inaudibly, from the hidden\nspeakers in the plush lounge bar of that\nrespectable Watneys pub, was an instrumental version of that song that just\nfive years ago was urging me to revolt.\nSort of Bert Kampfaert meets the Rollings\nStones.\nIt's sad but all our old fave raves\nsoldier on turning out the same old stuff\nbut becoming more and more uninspiring.\nThe new generation haven't produced\nanything except reggae and Jimmy\nOsmond and they haven't exactly got\nimpact.\nMarmalade never have been w,o rId shattering and I'm surprised they're\nstill around, but here they are with\n'This House is Rocking' which contains\nbut unoriginal music.\nMost of the tracks start off In a promising way but due to lack of innovation leave the listener unmoved.\nOld Country Rhythm features a sadly\nforgotten relic of the past-the drum solo.\nThe first track is a fine rocker with some\ntasty brass. A song about Douglas (Isle\nand remix these sounds (old and new),\ncreating a new refresh iii g theme. Well\nworth checking out.\nHie\nRichard Betts: 'Highway Calf (Super)'.\nSOME SLIGHTLY stronger fare for the\nmusic-loving palate. A rendition by\nRichard 'don't call me Dickie' BettsI'ace fingerboard f litter from les f re res Allman, exuding solid, cultured, southern t 'country' picking, if that's your taste.\nHe's a damned fine guitarist but be\nwarned if you're expecting Allman rau nch, this is undiluted, laid-back-and-lazy C and W. Not normally liking (some would\nsay appreciating) country music, I was\nsurprised to find myself initially enjoying\nthese pleasant finely-textured ramblings\nwhich above all. are expertly played.\nIt's nice music but sometimes you\njust don't want to go to sleep and after\na while country can get damned boring.\nFor one particularly fond of Carlos\nSan tana in full slight, percussion pack\nat his heels, this is mind numbing ly slow,\nif technically accomplished. Still, if you\nare fond of country and western, give it\na listen.\nof Man) appears on the second side and\nwhy not? When is someone going to write\na song about Ladbroke Grove?(*Where'ere\ni wend, where'ere I rove, I always think\nof Ladbroke Grove. The dirt, the slums,\nthe drunks, the bums' etc).\nNeil Sedaka - Bad Blood \u2014 Polydor\n(single).\nAND I said Marmalade are getting\nold \u2014 Neil Sedaka is a relic from somewhere around Neanderthal Man's time.\nS should admit that whenever I listen\nto Neil Sedaka's record I conjure up\nvisions of a fat jerk, wearing a sports\nshirt and grinning inanely behind a piano.\nWhich means I'm biased.\nHe sings it as though he's in some\ndegree of pain and while a flute screams\nout, he sings 'doo run doo run ditty ditty\ndoo run'. No doubt a chart buster\nPhilip Webber\nEric Clapton: Willie and the Hard\nJive (Polydor)\nJUST in case you don't know this is\na single record, the name track being\ntaken from '467 Pacific Boulevard'\nClapton's recent LP. Side A with the\nname track is very nearly reggae (good\nreggae) and sounds like a new version\nof a very old tune. Side B is rock in\ncontrast, which I prefer personally. Compared to the run of the mill single this\nis a good one but I think you would be\nbetter off listening to the LP having the\nbenefit of a lot more variation.\nGeorges Moustaki: Declaration\n(Polydor)\nThis is predominately a French LP, because even though Georges Moustaki\nis Greek, he spent most of his life in\nFrance, so if you can't work out the\nwords you are going to miss a lot of the\nlyrics which are quite funny and/or\nsubtle depending on the mood of the\ntrack. The one track in English would\ngive you a good idea though.\nHowever, not to worry, this LP is very\npleasant to listen to without knowing\nwhat it says. All the tracks are very\ndifferent, Moustaki does not seem to get\ninto a rut of one particular type of\nrhythm, the general type of music singing\nto the accompaniment of his guitar and\nhis four piece support band, occasionally\nwith a chorus thrown in. To give some\nidea of the variation here are the tracks\non this LP (his fourth): Declaration\n(Je declare I 'etat de bon he ur permanent)\u2014\nI declare a state of permanent happiness;\nLes Enfants d 'Heir \u2014 Tomorrow's Children; L 'Apolitique; Le Quotidien;\nWhy Les Eause de mars - The Waters of\nMars; Nos Quinze Ans - Our Fifteen\nYears; Xu Xu Be/eza; Nadiejda; Ballade\npour Cinq Instruments \u2014 Ballad for five\nInstruments.\nThis is generally music rather off the\nbeaten student track but well worth\ngetting a listen to, to see if you like it\nor not and if you are multi-lingual he has\nrecorded in Italian, Spanish, English,\nFrench, Greek and Arabic. I hope not\nall on the same LP.\nMichael Swidzinski\n\n"

Apart from the groups, the evening ended in a 'Bobbing Apples' competition between the CCU's and ICWA\n(which the Royal School of Mines nobly won). A good time was\nhad by all? True enough the departing crowds were full of comments of 'Had a great time',\n'A good evening, Julia',\n'Wouldn't have missed it', etc.\netc. Always but ALWAYS\nfollowed by these immortal\nwords 'Good-bye'.\nYes, I do think the evening\nwent well, despite the fact that\nwe lost money in putting it on.\nThis isn't my grumble.
